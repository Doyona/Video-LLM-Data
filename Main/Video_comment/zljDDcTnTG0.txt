Fucking HEROES 🔥😭🥺💖🥰
This is my favorite song about a creep in a dress 💪
Well done, is nice to hear a sex positive song that touches on some of the society imposed inner turmoil if you LGBTQIA+. Very nice and thank you!
2:01
"This is me expressing my  self and if you don't like it, you can fuck off!"fucking bar-in! Great song!
I like the song but the trans stuff is too much for me. Sad you've lost the plot mate.
If only all elder men were like this. Thanks guys. Your awesome. ❤😂❤😊
"One, two, three, to the bastard four My ex-wife is bastard whore Five, six, to the bastard seven Kick us in the balls like David Beckham Eight, nine, to the bastard ten Pecking on a crotch like a free-range hen Raising a glass to the gays and bi's and the trans and the girls and the big bald men  You better not assume my pronouns You ain't got a clue what I feel inside Shake my ass while I play Beyoncé You wanna come fuck me then get in line (that's right) I'm a top shelf piece of ass Don't touch what you can't afford If I spin that pole, better give me cash And then I clap them cheeks, and I'm out the door"
I’ve watched this a few times… but the random dude who comes in and dances once… then instantly leaves was fucking funny as hell. How did I never notice.
I never ever want to hear "they're from a different generation" as an excuse again.
Wtf Norman
What are PKJ's pronouns, anyway
2:01 - 2:13 goes so damn hard
lol, old english white guys reppin for the lgbtq+ community! go gramps go!!
When I get elderly I want to be them
Eminem has been real quiet since this dropped
Holy shit, top lads 🎉
Shoutout Kevin, we stan
Trans-inclusive british old-man hip-hop was not on my list of music I thought I'd vibe so much with, but hey.
2025 /6 ANYONE ❤
0.01 seconds in to the video, "THATS MY FUCKING LOCAL"
This hasn't penetrated LGBTQI+ circles as much as it should have, because its actually excellent.
This needs to be turned into a karaoke track, so I can sing it at our company's Christmas party!  I don't have a sequined dress, but me wife has a feather boa, so we can make do. 🎶🤣
Favorite song on the summer❤ Love from a Texas Bear  Woof-

"it was a different time back then" wrong! the northern boys get it!
I see my future, and it is bright.
perfect video perfect music, ally !
Excited to see these guys tonight!!! 🤩
Niice. My ex wife is a bastard whore also. Literally.
no buzi
1:49 is legendary.
Nothing beats sitting on the bog hobbing a wonk.
3:03 That right there is perfect.
As a non-binary person I felt the angry love from this one. Thanks Boys, I’d party with ya.
We love you! Thank you!
Pipe up NEW FAN if the Birdcage brought you here.  Pipe up BASTAHD HOOR if you saw the short and knew the song instantly.

Love you lads!
This song could heal the whole world 😂❤
YESSS
Younger trans boi here, this is such a damn mood
The Bukowski of our generation
Absolute club banger 😮
This is peak
Listening to this on loop the morning before a rave
I come back to this whenever I need a pick me up
humiliation ritual
The boys dropping bars.
They know their audience for sure
Wtf did I just watch?
As a young queer man who constantly gets judged and lectured by the older generations it's so nice to see old lads being genuine allies and having fun with it, hats off to you boys keep it up
Classic
the moment pat is taking his shirt off and kev is just calmly standing in the corner admiring the view 🍾🍾😂😂
Pansexual man here to say that this song unironically bops.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I want to be the guy in the suit. There for the good time, he is.
лирика хип хопа
I knew the Northern Boys were based, but i had no idea they were THIS based.
To think this country was once the biggest Empire the world had ever seen, one on which the sun never set. Karma stings, doesn't it?
I am speechless, flabbergasted, astounded, and absolutely amazed. You all are BRILLIANT. This is, without question, one of the greatest things I have ever seen. Please come to Austin, Texas, USA
True unflitered inclusion. True gold and for sure a bop.
Oh fuck yeah 🤘❤🤘❤🤘
High key becoming a cult favourite among trans folks <3 well done <3
Tgis song is vulgar and wholesome at the same time. Plus it slaps. Great job Boys :)
Get out of my head.
"Raisin a glass to THE GAYS AND THE BIS AND THE TRANS AND THE GIRLS AND THE BIG BALD MEN" Slaps so DAMN HARD
When times get RUFF I DUST off the cocaine pack, and sniff it from an ass like a BEAGLE! WORD PLAY!!!!
ghoooid video i sent you a dm hopefuylly we can collab in the future xx
that verse at 1:48 goes SO damn hard
I still don't know what hobbing a wonk means
Dude in the dress, you freaking rock!
2:01 best part
TF2
I aspire to be this hype when I get old
I love everything about this video and the song slaps 🔥 🎉

Straightest tabletop game party

Nope. I'm out. Be what you want, it's all good. Don't expect me to indulge your delusional thoughts, darling.
i probably have written this under ever video but please come to germany, the brexit has made visiting the uk not as easy..
"This is a video of me expressing myself and if you don't like it, you can eff off!"  SUPERB!
splendid
I see that the homosexual  underground is undergrounding
Norman woke up one day and decided to make the most based music video ever made
Telling my kids this  was the peak of trans rights
I don't know what to think about this video other than laugh. I don't hate anyone I just find it unsettling Watching a man and women's clothes dance LOl. These guys are so funny
If you’re wondering why they’re dancing on a wood floor? They cut the carpet up with those moves.
i accept everyone <3333   !!
Dude it's amazing how I'm not seeing even a single f****** comment where anyone talks about the whole drug point of the song you can easily assume they're glorifying drugs that he even says the line one is enough for me he's essentially saying he's not a big fan of it but he understands it and if we all had the same understanding drug addiction wouldn't be a problem because it's the same thing with transphobia they both come from a misunderstanding of the world around you
Thank you for all the wonderful and supportive comments. It's hard to remember that our community and our supporters will kick ass for us sometimes.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just realised why I like the instrumental so much (lyrics were first love) IT SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE BLACK OPS 2 what soundtrack uhh Club Solar,,,,y'know??? The club song...Shadows (Outer Club Solar) --- Okay just compared them and yeah not exact exact but fuuuuuuuuuuck that's close I love it
These guys are sick!!!! I'm going crazy for the guy in the heels
so nice to see the boys support the GBTGBBM community
Id love to have a night out with baldie. He looks so much fun 😂... I always skip to his verses lol.
Still such a great song and such a positive message. <3

Trannies give me the boke
As a trans I LOVE this BUT give some love to the ace and censor the words :3 (who care if there is 2 versions ❤… honestly even if there’s a straight version idgaf just be real ❤)
Should be the national anthem
The way he says "bastard" in that accent is a like a beautiful work of art to my ears 😃❤
Someone show Katya this song
It's nice that he shouted out the big balled men, we men with big balls need love too.
5 FT 9 " IN MY 6" INCH BOOTS😂😂😂😂😂
this is a very special song, to me. intentional comma.
I love this country so fucking much
💯
I am late to this but I love it so much. So delightfully strange. Like me.
Im straight & In❤ with this song...WTF❤
You're looking at the winners of the 69th eurovision song contest
Fkn Brilliant.
Incredibly based
Early 2000s... Dancing shoes. By a Sheffield rapper fella. Any idea who he was?
I've just discovered the best band ever. Thanks lads. You are now on the Free-Range Dinner Ladies Motorcycle Clubhouse playlist.  ( Holmfirth hard lads lol)
This is all types of good
I swear Im gonna go to london to a show of these guys lmao
Norman sounds like zig and zag 😂
Raising a Glass to the gays and the bis and the trans and the girls and the big bald men
Let’s go boys, give it to those youngsters.
hilarious lyrics
i havve been sitting here tryin to find this song for the past 20 minutes
Showing the Americans how it's done 😂❤
I'm not proud to admit it but PKJ is kinda bratty and it's working for me. And damn Norman is working that dress
“Raising a glass to the gays,the bi’s, the trans, the girls, and the big bald men” is actually actually a hard ass line- and I respect it
This shit is so fucking cool and punk. It’s everything!!!!
The final 16 bars in this track have cadence that would blow the balls off an iron gorilla
it's like the olimpics in here
ftw
!!!GET THEM ON EUROVISION!!!
Upvote if youre listening in 2024
ContraPoints base music and inclusive lyrics just perfection.
Love it lol
NORTHERN BOYS!! Dont ask my pronoun you anit got a clue how I feel inside! This ones for ladies, this ones for the men, shout out everyone inbetween you gotta love them!
Remember when they dropped Party Time and all those chodes were pretending there was norhing queer at all about these dude 😂😂😂
You can always tell when people actually know trans folks because they are not scared of saying a wrong thing around us. As a trans lesbian you could snort coke off of my huge boobs anytime <3
I wish you had filmed this in a club!! Everyone would have gone mad for this for sure
Dónde encuentro esta canción subtitulada en español 😭
Are they pride or just....
I honestly wonder if they are making fun and the people watching are such parodies themselves they dont pick up on that 😅

I GOTTA BIG BALD HEAD -ALL THE BETTER TO MAKE ❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
mandatory pride month listening
happy pride to everyone dropping to their hands and feet and scuttling like a beetle 🏳️‍🌈
Oh shit. I kept thinking the bar in this video was very familiar, and then I saw the guard rails and the  the stage and the wood panel walls  Can't remember it's name, but we had it rented for a private gig once
Boomers: oh, we can't accept gay and trans people, it's so hard for people of our age to change the way we were taught! it's not our fault!  The Northern Boys: 2:01
What's this song about ?
SUBANLA A SPOTIFY

I love these guys so much
Hope you fine fellas are ready for the Eurovision 2025 invitation

The definition of a goddamn banger. Nothing but love from the U.S.
love every second of it
Bloody brilliant, thank you!
Amazing.
Media literacy leaving the room when something that makes tr[][]ns look like ridiculous dr(e)gs of society is made (By what is verifiably an old man who understands himself to be as such)
An actual BANGER

Guys, really. love you :3
I genuinely love how every single song I hear from these guys is deeply Harry DuBois-core
They really did say "TRANS RIGHTS" woth their whole fucking chest. Transphobes get fucked.
A Bar at the Folies-Bergère (1882)
The Northern Boys fuck no doubt.
ALRIGHT 🗣️!
Amazing.
LADIES WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET LOOSE LADIES WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET WILD LADIES WOULD YOU SHOW ME THAT MOOSE

I identify as a big bald man and I really appreciate this, thanks.
As a bald man myself I choose to feel objectified and misrepresented - and I like it :)
I did not expect this but I'm glad I tried something new

"ONE TIME FOR EVERYONE IN-BETWEEN YES YOU GOTTA LOVE THEM!"  as an in-between: 🥺
This is so healing for real
Yes it is poubelle, it is. I stand corrected.
How is this a pride song? Cause he mentions it? Is it also a pro drug, dog fucking song?
Why is it edited? For some reason it is skipping the inch worm line?
PLEASE COME PLAY A SHOW IN AUSTRALIA! 10/10 TIMELESS BANGER!
why does this actually go hard?
WHEN are you coming to North Carolina? We will be there.
Love these guys they’re fantastic
As a big bald man and soft old sod this mean >9000 times more to me than LGUHDTV+ alliance with sweat shop sportswear manufacturers that value shareholder value more than western civilization's achievement #TakeAKnee #sugdatcoq

These old wankers go harder than most.
i dont care if you gay... fuck it man!!!
i dont care if you are gay ....  i love everyone#!!!
Omg this guys are amazing
Song reminds me of me kiwi friend
I dont think the kids appreciate how rare it is to see a openly bisexual man over 50. you are seeing Bigfoot right in terms of rarity.
The lyrics theses guys knock out, top  stuff lads, keep on going
The bald one is in pete and bas group.  Hahah
When is the Christmas album coming out?
"This is a video of me expressing myself, and if you don't like it, you can fuck off." That's it. If you don't get it after that, that's on you and nobody else.
Found this gem from a Star Wars Bad Batch TikTok
If David Lynch was from West Bromwich
I don't support the life style but love freedom of speech (it's ment for people you don't agree with) and I find this song funny and also it hits hard. Well done.
So is normal gay?
1:46
Listening to this on repeat because frankly this is fantastic,thank you
Absolutely vibing with the song. Great track, definitely going on some playlists. Though I am a little frustrated that some of the words are censored in the subtitles even though they're not censored in the audio itself.
That piano line is low key fire.
This song is revolutionary
Will you three adopt me please? I'm only little and it's my 31st birthday in March
i do like it so much i'll fuck off anyway
"One time for everyone in between, yes you gotta love them" i feel so seen by this ❤
Just subscribed to the channel.  Saw this video through Twitch and just YES to all of it.  Awesome video with a great message.🥰
No one:  My brain at 3 AM: "One, two, three to the bastard four..."
Can someone please remix this with Marvel vs Capcom 2 player select music
This is beautiful! I came here from tumblr- a post with this video went viral there- and gosh as a nonbinary queer this makes me so happy! Thanks for being awesome :D
i didnt expect the most gender affirming thing today to come from 3 older guys rapping. but im glad it did
Please do a video with Still game cast 🤗
such sweet old boys
Patrick's ded
As a nonbinary person i'm honestly so happy getting a shout out!! this song is a banger.
This is beautiful T-T. Thank you for bringing it into my life T-T.
This is the best and funniest thing I've seen in ages...and I don't even like this type of music.  Gotta love angry Northerners! 😂
You are so absolutely gorgeous, and I love this so fucking much!  I legit actually cried from happiness from the power I felt from this song, such a cheer was brought to my smile!
I love this so frikkin much. Holy hells.
There is These Guys and then there is joe biden
i suspect these guys are me and my mates from future.... guy in suit doing as less posible thats 100% me, one with wild fashion style and drugs thats my johnny, and well Phil... not that he is crossdresser of lgbt or like funny... he is just him
Never stop making music. You never when you’re gonna hit.
best ode to queer people i've ever listened to i think
Bro looks stunning in that dress
this is so good! <3!
The shambolic cosmic chaos inclusivity poets we didn’t know we needed.
отвратительно
I think I found my new favorite song
Y'all gotta come to WA in aus
LADS LADS LADS LADS LADS LADS (inclusive)
Love every aspect of this. So much respect.
Shoutout to these guys who saved the year.
as a trans person I love this representation. You all are wonderful!!! 💜
Orlando, NYC , Seattle , San Fran.... lets go
seein these boys tonite!!!! fuckin HYPE
I've seen an edit on Tiktok with this song. This is awesome
the "one, two, three to the bastard four" part is phenomenal. these guys got bars.
Nottingham was a good laugh, thank boys :)
Why does this slap?
"This is a video of me expressing myself, and if you don't like it, you can FUCK OFF!"  YES NORMAN TELL "EM YOU GO KING
goes hard
Gotta love it when three elderly men understand pronoun use and gender identity better than most younger people.
Northern boys don't care if you're gay, straight, cis, trans, or anything else. They only care if you brought the coke, and are down to party.
"No need to drive I just drop to my hands and feet and scuttle like a beatle, when times get rough I dust off the cocaine pack & sniff it from an ass like a beagle."  BARS!!!! 🔥
cishet ally here and i totally adore and endorse this
Why have citibank pride when you could have old british blokes scuttling like beetles and drinking. This fucks
We need them in the US! ❤️🙏
Why are the LGBT in the comments thinking this isn't mocking them?
It's probably the most progressive song out there. I love this.
This is actually the best song ever
no need to drive i just drop to my hands and feet and scuffle like a beetle 🪲 when times get rough i dust off the cocaine pack sniff it from an ass like a beagle 🐕
RAISING A GLASS TO THE GAYS AND THE BIS AND THE TRANS AND THE GIRLS AND THE BIG BALD MEN 🗣️🗣️‼️‼️🔥🔥🔥
I’m crying… thank you for this  💜 from an old punk Queer
this is the best thing i've seen in my entire life !!
I found you guys on facebook and im literally obsessed now like ive showed your music to everyone i know lmao
Needs to be the ED to the next season of JOJO
I LOVE THIS!
Thank you for giving one out to me, too <3
Most gender affirmed I’ve ever felt
1:48 don't mind me, just bookmarking this part
Just so so good
I'm a bisexual transgender man, and I'm balding. And I hate it. I hate it so much that I shaved my head just so I can pretend I have some kind of choice in the matter. But the line "Raising a glass to the gays and the bi's and the trans and the girls and the big bald men!" did more for my self esteem than just about anything else! I'm a bi and a trans and an absolutely MASSIVE bald man and I've always been proud of the first two but for the first time I'm proud to be the third thing as well ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
I had a "friend" who cut all contact with me bc I wore a maid outfit for fun (I'm a man)  and she thought I was trans (I'm not)  and it's genuinely so stupid. If I was trans then so what? we're all human at the end of the day. this video screams the "Be unapologetically you" mentality and I love it
One time for the ladies, one time for the men, one time for everyone in between yeah you gotta love them! 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🖤💜🤍💛
Surreal.
this some Milli Vanilli shit right? i dont believe they're actually spitting
The older generation the world needs. Sending Love from Western Pennsylvania of America. Much love and hoping for more songs.
I don’t understand why they bleeped out the drug names. That’s odd because they aren’t swear words.
He actually has great legs. 🤌
3:00 I fockin' love it
oh this FUCKS absolutely!!!! adding this to every playlist ever, thank you Northern Boys :D
This song has cured my depression
This what California looks like
i really want to believe it's just the old fellas rapping, but i cant
Carl Jung once said that if you cannot conceive of yourself as a member of another gender, then you cannot truly perceive your self at all.
holy shit thats great
My guys, we need this to pull up in finland
This will hit 1M before the year ends
Too political for me.
I wanna grow up to be just like Pat.
wtf is that band? so AWESOME! just dont find any information
Dreams are valid indeed woooow❤❤❤
This is oddly the best thing I've found in my 18 years of life
I played this at my coming out party and I think that's the highest bar I'll ever set for myself
Can you put on doing what you're doing you Old Gentleman you made a thirty-five-year-old man who had a very bad day laugh his f****** ass off thank you
this is the only thing in this whole world that matters
Absolute banger!!!!!
YES  YeEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS
this is wild
I'm strait as fuck but love this song love how it includes everyone
I am not even capable of dealing with how well Norman rocks a dress
This is OFFICIALLY the craziest thing I've seen and heard all month, and I just watched Cocaine Bear.  EDIT: P.S. I LOVE IT!!!!
If I'm not as cool as them by the time I'm their age I'd rather die.
This honestly made me tear up a bit. Thank you for being inclusive. ❤❤❤
Fucking gold! Cheers mates!
This song feels like a flashbang that I don't regret
1:10 LOVE THIS LYRICS AAAHAHAHAHA
STRAIGHT WHITE MALE aka boogie man to most .. this song is pretty cool .. never be ashame of who u are .. just rock it
I love these guys!
I love you guys
pink guy has 3 grandads?
Lmfao right now...😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What’s the backing track to this? It’s some kind of 90s banger but I can’t put my finger on it.
I found this song through an edit of peter b peter lmao😊 im obsessesed with their songs now
1:47
When you touring the states?!
Wow this is fantastic 😂😂😂👍🏻
I am soooooo glad I watched til the end! 😂 🤣
This is the perfect queer rep we've been wanting
Lost me at 2:00
1:31 10/10
I love these lads an unholy amount, this song has been a staple piece in my playlist since it first got released
Please please please come to New Zealand one day for a tour haha, we would love to have you!
:O :O :O
The woke future we all need.
My favorite part is after PKJ says "out the door" he looks confused like the line doesn't make any sense.
What a banger
Anyone else think they just taking the piss but people taking it serious?
I am keen for merch
Late night youtube is wild but hey get it guys i dig it
this is such a bop 🙏
I this is so lovely you guy's are amazing !!!!  please continue spreading the love <3
I have a crap day I play these I have good day haha
Fookin lovit
Sometimes the world feels really not friendly as a trans person and then these guys make a song and I’m good for a few more months
It's interesting that so many people seem to be interpreting this as a straight up pro-LGBT political protest anthem. I don't know how people are seeing a 70 year old bloke with a moustache saying "don't you dare assume my pronouns" and an angry degenerate fella in a dress and heels singing about tucking his dick up between his legs and shouting obseneties about his ex-wife and think "Ahh yes, this is a genuine pro-LGBT pride song. They're definitely not taking the piss in the slightest". To clarify, I don't think this is pro- or anti-LGBT. I think the lads are just having a laugh. If there is a political message it seems to be "yeah all of this stuff is ridiculous but who cares, let's all just party and not take ourselves seriously".
Holyshit. There is hope for the human race after all, this is amazing.
"1,2,3 to the bastard 4, my ex-wife is a bastard who*e"💀
"This is a video of me expressing myself and if you dont like it you can FUCK OFF!" I love y'all so much, literal legends💗💞💖💕
This rocks.
Not even kidding this is the best song I've heard in a while
hell yeah boys ‼️🎉
I really wanna smoke a blunt with them, it sounds fun as hell
thx norman <3
Where is this world going , I 'm in shock
о боже , что за кринж
🤘
The fact he’s dancing with heels on
Tell Kev he's the david bowie of freddy mercury's
My confidence when this song plays 📈📈📈📈
Tell norm I’m waiting for a kiss
Great song
King shit. Bravo.
I'd love to know who the real artists are behind Pete & Bas + The Northern Boys + Frank and Maury, you can tell by the voices it's the same one(s) but the alternate reality that Sindhu World is spinning here keeps me guessing!
This is my new favorite band
One of those videos you should watch to the end.
1:00 For free!?!?
I'm not any part of LGBTQ+(not a hater just straight) but this song kicks so much ass it's making me rethink my existing preferences.
i cant explain it but dirkjake
I never thought id hear such a affirming track from a group like this. This is my 2nd song ive ever heard from them, and I definitely plan to listen to so much more now! Thank you so much, yall are amazing
Why is this so good
Pov: Bolson
I'm in love.
THIS IS SUCH A FUCKING BANGER!!!! OFFICIALLY PART OF MY DAILY ROUTINE TO DANCE TO THIS!
2:02 -2:13  is the best thing I ever heard and over all song is a masterpice XD😂❤
You know the legendary bars (and performer) at 1:49 is the most replayed part of this video, it's just have to be.  Absolute, fuckin', legends.
NORMAN FUCKING PAIN!
There's probably about a 50 year age gap but I'm pretty sure I'd be friends with these guys.
it gives me hope for being old being old doesnt have to be boring you dont HAVE to be into pot plants and knitting you can go out with your mates and make sillly videos
Get these guys to represent the UK at Eurovision. Might make that shitshow worth watching
New queer anthem dropped
The last place I expected to find such brilliant representation. Wow.
jumped the shark
TERF island in shambles, thank you northern boys
What in the f did I stumble on to? Internet is endless.   Love it!
"This is a video of me expressing myself and if you dont like it you can fuck off" was amazing you guys are great
One for the ladies one for the men and one for all in between. No there's no such thing there's only.    You're either born a male or You're born Female . Only mental patients believe that there's more than a male and a female. And if you don't like what I have to say well you could f*** off.😂😂 We don't have to be stupid and mental just because you choose to be dumb and stupid and mental. And by the way your lab experiment every time you take a vaccine eat the food that they put the pesticides and poisons in everyone is a part of their lab experiment. You expecially
As catchy as AIDS ☠️
Taking the absolute piss 😂 I love these geezers 🎉
Please keep expressing yourself. I feel more comfortable in this world with people like you. :)
absolute banger
This is the kinda art we need 💛🤍💜🖤
My pronouns are big/bald/men
Best pride song ever
I love this with my whole heart. It's so aggressively wholesome ❤
How come they sound like Pete and baas?
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
I FUCKING LOVE THIS
Respekt.
they will not want this played at their funerals in the next few years
I love this to the end of the earth and back
BBCC's grandparents?
Telling me kids these were the doors
Holy SHIT I HAVE BEEN SLAYED
1:48
being a masc nonbinary person, i have never felt so validated by a song before
wtf is this and why is it actulaay good XD
well this was deffenetly not my proudest wank...
whatt??? y'all are amazing!!!
People who says this isn't supportive of the queer community because it's satire miss the whole point of humor and satire: If this was making fun of trans/nonbinary/queer people it would make them out as ridiculous and stupid. Instead it's an empowering piece about being yourself and showing others love and respect (and fair, doing lots of drucs and messing about which... not my thing but fair xD) It tells you that you "gotta love" anyone who isn't part of the gender binary and ends with "this is me expressing myself and if you don't like it you can fuck off" It doesn't say trans/nb/queer people are weird or bad or ridiculous, it celebrates party/queer circles and exudes body positivity aggressively which I love. All of you look (if I may) SNATCHED in this video. Love the aggressive positivity, the beetle mention, the heels, the vibes, the mention of (big) bald men (who are often considered gross/ugly/etc)  It is incredibly sincere and positive and people who wave it away by saying "it's only satire" are spewing nonsense.
IT'S THE NORTHERN BOYS!!!!🤘
I just saw my future and it's not pretty
🤣😂🤣😂🤣 Do Not F🤪CKING Die ❗ Safe travels 🙏♥️🐾🐾🇦🇺
Also… as a big bald man… I can finally feel proud lol
Who ever produced this is a genius. Bringing in that house piano on the hook is so perfect
Oh my god I only just got around to this but boys you are KILLING IT!!!
banger haha
hearing the boys giving us nonbinaries a shout-out made me so damn happy. this is my own personal pride month song lol. norman is slaying in those heels too, get it dude!
This song reminds me of my friend Matthew/mattpatt
Love this so much.
Based and queer pilled, good stuff
I've actually seen a few of them drinking, and they can do much more then what's shown in this video!
Where has this been all my life!
Great song, but I think we should give Kevin credit for his amazing interpretative dancing
Kevin kills it everytime. Doesn't even need a wank.
But what if we do like it? ( : p )
I can´t tell if this song is meant seriously or if this is a parody. I mean lines like "you better not assume my pronouns you aint got a clue what i feel inside" and "if you see me cry you better walk on by ´cos i don´t want to share the pain that´s inside" don´t seem very serious.
1:48 ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Not where I was expecting a pro-lgbt message but goddamn I'll take it
I know who’s singing at my wedding
this is peak musical masterpiece.
here again
a collab with Lil Jon would be bonkers!!
Love how often Patrick references his own death in his lyrics lol
Absolute king shit, lads.
English culture be like 🎉❤
"and if you don't like it, you can fuck off"   It's that simple people! Listen
this says a lot about our society
Wonderful!
this is unironically my favorite song of yours this is amazing <3
"One time for everyone in between, yes, you gotta love them!" is genuinely a brilliant line.
I fully expected some more Pete And Bas. I 100% did not expect this, and I am 100% here for it.
“You better not assume my pronouns, you don’t have a clue what I feel inside!”  LOVE IT
I BEG YOU PLS MAKE A TOUR AROUND EUROPE AND COME TO POLAND PLS PLS PLS
G shit
This is the last group that I expected to make me feel so fucking validated.
i used to say that if england sank into the sea the world would be better off, but I was wrong because the Northern Boys are in England.
I can’t be the only that think this slaps 10/10 an amazing experience
Not all heroes wear capes… some are bald and wear dresses
What song are they sampling?
The variety of stuff norman pain puts out is impressive.   +1 for the constant digs at his bastard whore of an ex wife
If 2pac and biggie were still here we would of had this masterpiece.
RAISING A GLASS TO THE GAYS & THE BIS & THE TRANS & THE GIRLS & THE BIG BALD MEN 🗣🗣🗣
This is my new favorite song
As one of the ones in between, I very very very much love this ♥
😂 sniff it from the ass like a beagle 😂
I am speechless, confused and wildly entertained, and perhaps mildly arroused I honestly cannot say due to the insane level of confusion.
.-. oooook then haha
I like Pete and bas but, y'all just have a better vibe. I appreciate the descriptions of going complete and utter goblin mode and the affirmation.
I work at starbucks and I wish this fucking banger would play all day instead of listening to “Born this way” for the 50th time
this is the best song i've heard in years
Fucking Northern Boys being way more progressive than most others. Let's get drunk and fight some regressives
pride month anthem
Happy pride 2023.
This one, ironically, shows a lot of balls.
The aggression and the support together makes this a masterpiece
Happy pride to the Northern Boys and the Northern Boys only
WE NEED A PEOPLE JUST DO NOTHING SPIN-OFF BUT ITS called “OAPS DO BITS” and it’s these lot doing the opposite and being 10x more successful 😂
this song is genuinely so good wtf im obsessed
Fuck we love these dudes down in Australia. Wish they'd tour lol
Excellent work Kevin, per usual.
Changing the world with a bop incarnate.
happy pride yall !
Can't believe I missed the newest Northern Boys song when it came out, but what an awesome video to discover during Pride Month!!!
this is cringe
Every time I think I can't love you boys more, you slap me right in the face with are hot banger full of unapologetically authentic poetry and I find out just how wrong I was.  Much love from the asshole of the US! Florida loves you! (Except the racist homophobic dickheads but they don't count as people)
I love you <3 great song guys xoxox
Maffew sent me
Northern Boys slap so hard
i love u sm
Gotta love Norm <3

1:48 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I don't think I've been smiling this much at a song in so long! This is awesome 😂😎
I need you guys in finland like asap.
okay but norm's kinda killin it in that dress
So I'm assuming they're dropping singles until it forms an album? Love it, we need more northern boys! I want some more hype beats baby
My new idols ❤
SLAYYYY BOYSSS!!!!
I just stumbled across this. Im not totally sure what I just saw.... However, I am completely here for this, whatever the hell this is.
When the heck is “nobody likes me” going back on Spotify and Apple Music
unfathomably based
This is the future.
This the song I had my first kiss with my partner to.
great song. the comments are full of clowns talking about pride or some dumb shit, which goes to show how desperate these clowns are to see themselves in entertainment that they'll take three old man rapping as a win. that's the funniest thing here 🤣
halfway through norman's bastard counting is GENIUS and then PKJ takes the song home with one of his best verses yet 😂 this brings me so much joy guys
My new favourite group 🎉
banger
A queer anthem of this quality comes along once in a lifetime
I keep coming back to this song. It's just marvelous.
Grandpa’s at it again 😂
Who came here from botchamania
Why does this go so hard?!
This is the hardest song I’ve heard 😮
I love you guys your soo umazing
so glad theyre still making stuff
this slaps. good job mates
This warmed my cold little enby heart. Love it ❤
Love it ❤🎉
I'm totally saving this to my phone and putting into my LGBT Pride Playlist.
Fucking based hell yes
THIS 😍
Thank you internet for making me finding this amazing piece of art ❤❤❤
This is my happy song over here in the hell hole the is America
1, 2, 3 to the bastard 4, my ex wife is a bastard whore  🔥🔥🔥 Absolutely the best line I've heard this year
i feel happy
As a non-binary this had me dancing around my house!
This is the Mike ermantraught spinoff we need
I'm really glad that they censored the text saying "bastard". That was a bit much. I think it's OK to show this to mum now.
Lmao
Yes!!! A tour is needed.
God I love these fuckers
THEY DID IT FOR THE GIRLS AND THE GAYS AND THE BALD OLD MEN
idk what i was expecting going into this but im very pleased with the outcome regardless
oh i love this song
This gives me the best Happy. Like, am I having a bad day? A mediocre morning? FIXED by rewatching this video.
The MOST VIEWED PORTION OF THIS VIDEO..... IS A CLOSE UP OF NORMAN PAIN. Or maybe it's personal history? Road to 1mil views
MUSTACHE WIDE
smash
REAL
This needs a proper house remix
PRIDE 2023 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🎉
Honestly thought that was Roy Hodgson dancing away at the beginning!
This is very wholesome and sweet and I am going to set it as my alarm so it is the first thing I hear when I wake up in the morning
Absolute legends
This transports me to another dimension
That last line 🤘🏻
UK is kinda scary for trans people right now and seeing something like this is really fucking cool. You guys are really helpful in so many ways.
nine to the bastard ten has serious june osborne retribution stare vibes somehow 1:57 better not mess
I dunno how I got here? But I'm glad I did.

Why am I obsessed!!!!

ONE TIME FOR THE LADIES! ONE TIME FOR THE MEN! ONE TIME FOR EVERYONE IN BETWEEN YES YOU GOTTA LOVE THEM!! 🥰🥰🥰 ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Saw a clip from this on instagram earlier today by chance. Glad I had the privilege of discovering this banger
Northern boys to represent United Kingdom in Eurovision 2024 ❤🎉
Halfway there. Road to 1 million views... Sup UK?! 91Shots waiting patiently.. KEEP WRITING YOU GOONS then spit that shit up.
New guy here!  Can’t tell if these are their real voices or just lip sync’d lol

I have never seen anyone give less of a fuck.... and I love it.
1:47 This
Norman don’t give a shit!
(=-D
Loving this!! 💖✨
Y'all sick bastards... are fucking awesome.
Is this real? Are those three dudes actually the people singing/rapping?
Shout out to the Northern Boys and the gays and the bis and the trans and the girls from a big, bald man!
served.
These guys are a ripof of pete n baz 😂😂😂😂 terrible
Love a song that both myself (bi, girl) and my dad (big bald man) feel empowered by
hope you kings can come to new zealand at some point
Everyone's like yay lg*t anthem ...are yall too stup*d to understand when were being mocked you muppets..Sindhu world too lol garauntee any money these lyrics are written by dr*g dealing "corner shop owners" ..we'll call them
This is by far the best thing the YouTube algorithm has ever thrown at me! Instant fan!
The northern boys are my favorite Ally's I would give the the pass to say the t slur and the f slur as an envy person this song is so validating
The Northern Boys are going to be anthems at Pride this year if it kills me.
This song is a banger and these guys rock nice to see guys like this being so progressive in these dodgy cruel times  🎵One  time for the ladies one time for the men one time for everyone in between cos you gotta love them 🎼
The only British people I like 🦾
trans rights
this makes me wanna party! these guys are cool as fuck!
June is coming. This is gonna blow the hell up during Pride. I can’t wait. Way to take a risk and take a stand, boys!
Can you guys preform at Grand Rapids Pride Fest please
Ugly crying. As an AMAB nonbinary person who loves your music, I can't express to you just how much this means to have your support for us queer folk. ❤❤❤❤❤
Cant wait to see them on NPR tiny desk
3:04 best line ever.
the beer slowly emptying throughout the song shows their authentic self
Came here from instagram to give it more likes and hopefully more visibility, the song is fire and you guys rock!!! I added it to my playlist so fast, gonna set it as my alarm clock 😂
Europe Tour when?
Y'all rock!
Omg this is fucking amazing
please come to Italy. we need you
You guys probably need help, but I hope you dont get any. Come on !
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this song is so gender i love it wtf
We see you Northern Boys and we love you!
This is exactly the energy the world needs right now. Fuckin hell. Love it.
Now these are what I call allies
"This is a video of me expressing myself, and if you don't like it you can FUCK OFF" This is the energy we need. Hell yeah, live your best life! <3
JEAHHHH!
I enjoy the saga of an old man hating everything and then discovering how happy being a woman makes her
This is my new Enby anthem! Keep up the great work, boys!
Thanks Alaska & Willam for this Rainbow Spotlight! 😆
Why did my best friend send me this……
This is fucking priceless!
Sweet Lord help me. You guys are fucking incredible 🤣🤣🤣 I haven't laughed this hard in years. I think I need to go put on a clean pair of pants. I can't wait for your next song, hope it will be soon. Greetings from IceMan your new biggest fan 🤟😎
Anyone who doesn't think these beautiful people aren't LGBTQ allies really need to look inwards cause now you're just imagining transphobia
This actually slaps
This song sucks I hate what this generation has come too.
propa belta lads when is bingo at the function?
You gotta have tungsten balls to drop a song supportive of the LGBTQ+ community in the UK nowadays. Respect.
This is the only bad that matters now. I’m a 21 year old in the states and I’m never gonna shut up about these dudes. I hope I become like them when I’m a wrinkled up old guy
what happened to Nobody Likes Me? it's been taken off of Sportify! Banger tune that and im actually gutted!
none of us are joking when we want you to audition to rep the uk for eurovision one of these years
I don’t know what I just watched, but I love it
Harry Styles wishes
Smashing it lads, keep it up 🍻
come to portland!!!
I didn't know there was a difference between northern boys and Pete and bas, but you really gotta appreciate bros aggression and the fact he's gonna go from rocking a suit to going hard on in a dress
Genuinely my favourite one yet I've been playing it all month
Found this song on tiktok randomly. Fell in love instantly.
Goes into a hook that's inclusive as fuck. Norman: My ex wife is a bastard whore!
😎 lyrics are pure fire 😎
This is a perfect song.
Maffew? If you see my comment send me some love 😁
This is what the inside of my cranium looks like
National treasure
I already loved The Northern Boys before....this song and video amplified that love times a million. Thank you for existing and putting yourselves out there unapologetically. My heroes!!! 💗
The end was too good.
This is gold.
Sounds very much like the guys who do the puppets Zig & Zag from C4 lol
I feel so seen I love you guys :,)
Rick Harrison hasn't been the same since leaving pawn stars
I don't know why but I like it somehow
I don't know how do they have such a good flow wtf
Jesus christ man, whether it's sattire or meant to be taken as a joke I don't give a shite you can't deny this is actually an incredible song
I LOVE this song!
I've genuinely been jamming to this for the last few days, I'm obsessed
Geniuses....
Headliners for pride?
*Honest Thoughts:*  ➤ Is it just me or is the Chorus / Hook “Give it to me” lacklustre compared to the rest of the music? Because I’ve listened to this twice now & it’s becoming increasingly more difficult to ignore this. It just doesn’t sound right & I find myself skipping these parts because it sounds worse with every listen. I think it’s the loud voice saying “Alright” that ruins it…
Here from Mania of Botches 471, a surprisingly catchy track
Hobbin' a wonk.
never in my life i thought someday i would've felt represented by 3 old scottish men throwing curse words here and there while in drag
this is perfect
I love these old b*stards
in a time of hate and division the guidance we need is truly these wonderful rank bastards
This song hits differently  Is Norman coming out?
Wtf is das geil 😂
SO FUCKING ICONICCCCCC I LOVE THIS SO MUCH  YOU ROCK SO HARD
Republicans fear this
Absolute banger! Top tier, Boyz
Fucking legends... I love this!
So I'm non binary and this is genuinely one of the most gender afferming songs I've heard I have so much respect for the northern boys
THIS IS INCREDIBLE
The alphabets claiming this as an anthem and I couldn't be laughing harder
This is the most positive comment section I've ever seen. I will buy your album if/when it drops.
this deserves 6 million views
Love these folks!!! ❤
love to see y'all on the other side of the Atlantic sometime haha, best of luck on your tour guys, every songs a banger.
I do like it, can't keep that energy down!
"listen up pal, i could die right now" always catches me off guard
This lifted me out of my depression and made me forget about my ex for three minutes and eight seconds. Another catchy banger!
now i want to watch boondock saints
New Pride anthem just dropped.
F*CKING GIVE IT TO ME 😂♥️👍🏻
The only boring thing about this video is the beers this bar sells :D
this song has been the bright side of my life lately. thank you northern boys <3
Honestly feel my partner so much from these guys. I myself,  demisexual. He, straight cis ally. But he'll put a dress on for any occasion to further the queer equality movement.
I'd about lost hope anything good was going to come out of this decade but then I discovered the Northern Boys.
this owns so hard
this is hard
Best believe I'll be streaming this
genuinely the sound of the summer 🏳‍🌈
Fucking Iconic.
You lads are so fucking real for this. So sick dudes 🤙♥️
yeah im shaking my ass..... seriously tho it is scary to be a queer person right now so thank you for this moment of joy.
This is what I'm gonna be chanting during Eurovision
Thank you I will be singing “one, two, three to the bastard four” for the next few months now
Just when I thought the Nothern Boys couldn't get any better 💖
i want norman to serve me drinks at a drag bar, 100%
Can't wait to blast this at Pride this year
how is this song only at 22k?
Botchamania brought me here anyone else?
This slaps fr
So damn awesome! I love it!!!
absolutely jammin rn
Ok but that beat is actually fire, which also just makes it even funnier. I love it
Have this on repeat rn. This easy to be inclusive to all genders, and ofc to big bald men. We all deserve the right to get fucked up
New anthem ✨ found the clip on Instagram and the song is even better than id hoped for ❤
AYYYY!✨️
We Northern boys, and THE Northern boys™️
100/10
Thanks daddy.
These guys just can't help but stay winning
GENUIS   👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧😂😂😂😂😂
You don’t understand I LOVE THEM
Love these coders. They bring a right smile to my mug. Straight Mental.  Love them.
Bless Botchamania for bringing me over here.
Botchamania brought me here, but I'm not going anywhere.
This song is more supportive than ny parents
SLAYYYYY
as a trans guy this made me unreasonably emotional, thank you boys!
If you look at the spike of "Where youtube users replayed" it's tight at the start. This is an universal banger! Liebi Grüess from Switzerland lads!
I just want to find someone to love, marry and to divorce to say " 1-2-3 to the bastard 4"
I love that they sing about consent. I've been on pinterest and seen so many posts about how men treat women and its just so depressing. It makes me so scared that something is gonna happen to me, and I'm only 16. So, thank you.
Wait what are Patrick's pronouns ?
ye i don't like it, I ABSOLUTLEY LOVED IT you nailed it!
Thanks to Maffew this is my new favorite song.
these guys kind of make me think of a far less-problematic older british version of the bloodhound gang, or something... party on!
Here from Botchamania and it’s such a banger!
Found this from a meme and now I’m just vibing
See? You can be a one hit wonder too.
Hi yall! Just got here from Botchamania chasing down this track. Did not expect a norvern dragster finals. Not disappointed,  and grooved my ass off. Much love from another str8 ally.
Thanks botchamania for this am addicted this music
One time for everybody in between you gotta love them! ICONIC
Botchamania sent me here!
I heard this on Botchamania. Oh my god its amazing. along with party time
New reason to keep living: seeing the northern boys live if they ever come to a country close to me in Europe
Botchamania
As long as you don't go into women-only spaces like their toilets or changing rooms, that's fine
That might be the best song Ive heard in a decade.
Botchamania brought me here
Botchamania brought me here 🎉🎉
They should be commissioned to write a new National Anthem 👍
Your voices and the flow are amazing !
I've heard a couple of your songs before, but as of today things are different.  I've subscribed, and I look forward to your next and subsequent songs! I love this !
Botchamania braught me here
not this becoming my Bisexual, GenderFluid anthem 🎼🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🌈🎶
I need to bump this louder 'til it rattles my bones to dust 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🎉🤸
RETURN of the fucking KINGS!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
The Northern Boys said trans rights and they've never been more right.
Botchamania 471
This is such a banger tho!
This is a masterpiece
Maffew sent me...
I'm not gonna say I cried a little when the Northern Boys said "trans rights" but my eyes might have leaked a bit. Thank you for everything.
I love you guys!!
TRANSMAN FROM DETROIT HERE PLEASE PLEASE COME TOUR HERE EVERYONE WOULD LOVE YOU❤  this song at a pride festival is TO DIE FOR
astronomically based
I didn't expect Norman to sound like ant at the end there
PEACE AND LOVE ON PLANET EARTH
this needs to be the pride anthem in june
This ain't it.
Brilliant
One of the best pride songs I’ve heard
THEY DON'T MISS
Oddly wholesome, and inclusive
This genuinely slaps. Like I love this song.
The northern boys are my heroes
Norman goes wild with each line 😂 and PKJ always has the best flow ❤
Big love for all of you. But the biggest shout out goes to Norman, do have to say that you clearly wear it well <3
THIS THIS IS GOOD
Out of the 3 songs so far, this is weak.
New personality trait unlocked
"This is me expressing myself and if you don't like it, you can fuck off!" Oi! Fuck yea mate. Rock that shit
The B in LGBT is for big bald men
Look, were going to need you to come to Ohio... I'm sorry
Love this song so much
This and cupkkakes LGBT are the best Pride songs ngl
I apologize in advance to my neighbours, but they must become aware of this masterpiece
fuck yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Now that's the pride song we all needed
This is so good ❤😂 old queens are the best and it's great seeing older men not just accepting but being a part of the community ❤
This is The Official Pride Anthem now
stuck in my playlist forever.
"I'm a topshelf piece of ass, don't touch what you can't afford" gotta be the hardest line of the year
i was in the middle of a breakdown and then i remembered this song exists, instant fix
What's the sample? I thought it was "Show Me Love" by Robin S, but that's not it.
We NEED you in the states man!!!
If this song doesn't make Eurovision I'm killing myself
Absolute icons
based as fuck
This is the video to show to people who use the excuse "they are from a different time"
I cannot describe how much I love this with words ❤
best allies fr fr
This is proof that's it isn't 'just their generation'
I love the northern boys this, and nobody likes me are two of my favourite songs
This is what a true ally looks like
COME TO BRAZIL
What is the beat from
I just love u boys
Absolutely iconic
Love that this group has been adopted by the LGBT+ community
Strong stuff! I love it!
FUCK YEAAAAAA PRIDE MOTHER FUCKERSSSSSS
Trans anthem
OK, I want a BBCC feat.
Patrick violently assuming a new gender identity mid song
I can't believe I was born in the same era of yet another Moon landing and also the existence of The Northern Boys.
The most unironically musical and comedic troupe that ever has been.
Too gay
Wow!! Raising a glass for you to guys ! ❤ what a clip !  Come for a tour in France !
Hobbing a wonk?
Kevin on beat like always ! love to see it
taking mah big ole balls down to sexy town
I'm not sure how I got here but I don't regret it.
This song actually feels so empowering to blast, thakn you so much Northern Boys
unparalelled humor, flow, and camp sensibilities.
norman fucking SLAYINGGG IN THAT DRESS I love y'all so much
Come to Nova Scotia
Art is great because of perception, interpretation, and emotional impact.  Say what you will about this speaking to your values or politics, whether you think it's ironic, sarcastic, or evidential of support.  At the end of the day it's art, and it speaks to people.  Gets them thinking.  I encourage everyone who wants to use this as a gateway to discussion, perhaps keep in mind that the Northern Boys recognize how relevant the topic is, and like all great artists are leaving interpretation up to you.  Be kind to one another.  LISTEN to one another.  Or, I mean.. you could always just stfu and slap that motherfuckin beat.  Choices.
BLACK AND WHITE MAYBE BABYYYY
Literally thought that was the pawn shop guy
What have I just found from looking at Irish rover songs haha
I love this SO MUCH
I'd actually like to see someone talk shit to Norman about his expression 😂 go on ahead, I'd love to see someone get their ass kicked by Norman in a dress and pumps 💅
I adore them
The Northern Boys cannot miss with their songs
We need a full album right now
It's great!
I fuckin love these guys!
I like the Stranglers reference
Thank you for making this big bald man feel seen.
Amazing work and so great to see you express yourself the way you want to :)
10/10 would listen to for hours
In context of what the world is going through right now, this makes perfect sense from both visual and sound perspective.
No one says FUGGING IT UP better than NORMAN PAIN. LESGOO ((((91SHOTS91SHOTS91SHOTS91SHOTS91SHOTS91SHOTS91SHOTS91SHOTS91SHOT))))
well this is completely amazing i love this, thanks and I want more! ^,^
Best thing ever
“Don’t need a girlfriend or a stable job” I’ll be sitting on the bog just hobbing wonk” absolute madness lyrics amazing!! But we need to see Norman walking or running in them heels properly
watch out youngsters these guys are the new gaga
Everytime I watch this video I like the song More. Road to a million views
Norman dance better in heels that i do. Please teach me your power
"Voices in my head Demons in my brain Chemicals in my veins I'm insane Can I be your friend? Don't ask questions (No) I'll do the fucking talking Do you like weapons? 'Cos I like fucking stalking I feel dead Punch me in my face I can't feel nowt"  Norman Pain
does that guy do the voice for zigg and zagg?
A work of art, right there.
They would be NOTHING without Kevin dancing.
I listen to this daily. I love it sm ❤
Big bald men are now officialy part of LGBTQ+, we just had a meeting with all of them, its confirmed
jazzed to see another banger from our boys <3
As a trans person this honestly means 100× more than performative allyship from big corporations. Keep up the good work boys.
You guys are fucking gold! 😂 Been waiting for the next tune for a while. I'll buy your album when you release one! Legends!
🔥🔥🔥
Yo. Allies.
Just a pro-queer, pro-consent, mental health advocating bunch of grandpas going completely ape shit on the mic and we can't get enough
I support them with my whole heart, and this is an absolute banger. Gonna be showing this to all my friends 🥰👏👏
The best
this should be our entry into Eurovision
I really love this! In my opinion, I wish they would leave the drug references out, but that's just coming from a SUD counselor 😂
This song goes so hard
Amazing. Proper Goldie Lookin' Chain vibes in the best way possible
Im in love
Why’d you take “Nobody likes me” off Spotify??
As part of this community, this is not only very positive, but also highly accurate.
We've only seen 1% of Kev's true power
absolute fucken 10/10 banger, thanks for the lgbtq+ rep lads, makes some of us feel a bit more welcome in the world
Utter shite, the ship's gone down.
“Raise a glass to the gays and the bis and the trans and the girls and the big bald men!”  Wake up babe new MOGAI just dropped
PKJ was fuckin' it up this time. Not gonna lie. We give Norman cred for the dress but the bars...
This shit bangs so hard
Got nervous when I saw the dress but my mates the Northern Boys are too abject for anything as boring as transphobia..... The greatest allies 👏
Bruh , 😂 👍
Keep up the great work, boys.
Shit goes hard but I ain't gay
I LOVE THIS GROUP
Praying for this to become their first commercial hit 🙏
How this hasn't got 9.7 billion views yet is beyond me, cause I've clocked up at least half! 😂😂
Bangin tune!!!!
2:01 best part unironically‼️
3/3 100% bangers
Can you believe Shawn Cee said white people add nothing to rap?
what does the third guy do
y’all get it !!!
Oh you KNOW we're bumping this all Pride month long
mmmm yes good
A fooking banger
Damn, nice legs Norman 😁❤❤❤
So easy!  When satire is reality, to make satire, out of satirical reality and people don't realise it...  If you don't like it, well, I don' t really mind :P
always a good day when i find out new northern boys dropped
You guys just keep crushing it! Can't wait to hear and see more!
This version of LemonParty is more fun.
Finally, an anthem I can sing along with
straight up banger
Never heard of or seen anything by them, but this is awesome.
fucking based
hahahaha i love it!
yet another banger
Northern Boys really said Trans Rights <3<3<3
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shiiiiiite..  Party time was way better.
Anyone know what 'hobbin a wonk' means?
Please come to Nottingham!
Norm gets around pretty good in those heels. Respek
Why is Nobody likes me unavailable on Spotify? very sad :(
You need to visit Poland 🇵🇱
Just bought my gig tickets, cannot wait to see you lads in october
Holy shit this is a certifiable banger. Congratulations you made it to the northern forest lake region of Georgia. I'm literally a year sober today and you're triggering me 😂😂😂 in a good way. The good memories.
Babe wake up new Northern Boys song just dropped
He looks good in that dress.
I love this
GO GRANDPA GO
I sniff it up! If I ever get to UK, Walmley social club will be my first stop.
you guys are amazing please keep expressing yourself its so fun ha! love yall! keep going! <3
I've been grinning and dancing along for the past hour ahahah
Pure comedy!
I'm so fucking grateful for a song like this in these terfy times ❤❤❤
I love this. Keep it up with the bops 👏
The way they said gay rights 💅🏽😮‍💨
What a tune
My wife’s boyfriend loves this one.
I feel that ppl arent properly appreciating the lyric 'no need to drive I just drop to my hands and feet and scuttle like a beetle'
Dope and absolutely hilarious. Somehow both wholesome and grimey, love it.
Thank fuck. Finally some good music.
I think the song is just meant to be inclusive in general, these have probably been given shit from the start because of their age and the song is just saying that anyone if free to do what they want if it means they are happy.
Very few things I can count on in life but Kev in that suit dancing like the universe is ending is one of them.   Great song as well. Ta.
you know for 3 old ass UK guys they make some fucking fire tunes
This goes harder than it has any right to go. Progressive as fuck.
Such a bop and we are only 3 months in '23, hope we got another this year !
People be like "Oh well they are from an older generation, you have to give them time!"  These guys are the best response to that EVER!!
This is fucking hilarious!!! You are fucking awesome!!!!! :D
what pub is this?
Loved the song, not much the topic but the one two three to the bastard four part killed me
youtube dropped the fuckin ball recommending this to me five days after it went up, despite being subscribed. to make it up to me, I would appreciate this video appearing in EVERYONE'S recommended, where it belongs
We don't deserve you.
Norman's "A-COME ON!" on the second hook has James Brown timing
Norman's got a cracking set of legs 😅
COME TO BRAZIL!!!!
Thanks for bigging up us enbies! ❤
THAT'S FIRE 🔥
Norman!! Those legssss!!! 🤩
I got so excited I went for a number 3
Always fire
Dammmmn Payday 3 looking good
I love everything about this
These Northern Boys gotta lotta love 👠❤️🍸🍻
Great pride song, not as much of a banger as the last two songs though
Album when, boys?
how tf a bunch of old people more progressive than most of the people at my school
Fucking hell these bois are fucked, I love it.
Come to America
When's the us tour though???
This goes hard as fuck 😂
if the northern boys do tour, please make it a global tour, we need you out in Australia
This is gonna be my Pride Anthem this year, we love y'all 🧡
Express yourself!
YOU ARE ICONS
Incredible
Hell yes
Touring Australia when??????
this goes so fucking hard
Is that Roy Hodgson?
Anyone know why Nobody Likes Me has been taken off of Spotify? 😭
🤣🤣🤣🤣
i bring my 10 y.o to school with your songs in the car, but no worries, only me get the lyrics.  I bet i'll be pissing his pants (again) when i'll show & explain to him, years later.  Salute from France, well done lads !
Fucking banging
Let's goooo! 🎉
The Northern Boys: LGBTQ Icons
The Northern Boys do it again. Glad to see you haven't stopped at one song. I can only hope I am going to be this wholesome at that age.
New anthem
How does it feel to have solved hatred in one song? Absolute champs
The boys heard Born This Way and said “hold me pint”.
yesssssssssssssssss mate this slaps
King shit
So sick
Oh. My. God. I've never been more into a song upon first listen. Holy shit.
aww hell yeah homies. This is the way 🙌
a track by the northern boys would go so hard on letterkenny
In a moment where I’m losing hope in humanity as a US citizen, this brought back a glimmer. You boys are icons and I hope you keep the bangers coming
Arhahahahaha
All I want is one song from them at a concert, but kevin is missing during the first half of the song until he rises from the stage with smoke and spotlights just dancing his dance
Good
This song reminds me of a big bald man who was my best mate and he's dead now but he would have LOVED this song and video. I'm sure I'm not the first to be brought to tears by The Northern Boys.
Yeeeeesssssssss
😊
dem boys freaky
Thanks for giving it to me
LETS GOOOOOO!!!
Northern Boys are the best allies
0:58 I'm almost 40, identify with this already, and it brings me hope knowing that yeah, things might not get better, but so what? There are ways to push through, deal with what life slings at you, and you can still try to have a little fun with the short amount of time we're blessed/cursed with. The Northern Boys are inspirational!
Que canción más basada... Me encanta!! 😊
True allies. Absolute banger as usual, lads.
I don’t give a shit about the politics. The fun of Northern Boys’ previous tracks was the hardcore depravity and self-depreciation matched by shockingly clever bars and a catchy hook. Getting serious in support a message inherently saps that fun, regardless of the message itself. A rare Northern Boys L.
northern boys said trans rights
yet again they bring us a fuckin bop, keep it up boys you’re killin it 🎉😎
I want to be like them when I grow up.
Imagine having the ability to release that. Unreal ❤
That moose hahaha
Holy fuck I needed this
This is the most beautiful thing I've seen all weekend.
Shark truly jumped
👏 👏 👏
Blowing the roof off Walmley Club!
The Northern Boys are the biggest, baldest allies we have and we need to protect them
Wholesome! Supportive! Absolute MASCULINITY!
We really needed a song like this. Things are awful for the LGBTQ+ right now especially for trans people, hearing this helps me feel hopeful that one day things will be okay for us and that we’ll be accepted by society.
Northern Boys said "trans rights", fuck yes
2:03 I like this outfit more than the other videos 🙃 He looks fuckin hot.
I love you, you old bastards❤️❤️❤️❤️🥺
I hope I'll be this unfathomably based when I retire.
What am i watching ahahaha
It's not as instantly amazing as Party Time was imo, but it's growing on me for sure! Keep up the great work! I hope I'll be half as cool when I'm old!
this slaps this slaps this slapssss ya did it again boys
YESSSS! Listening to this on repeat. THIS IS THE ENERGY IM TRYING TO EMBODY.
Big fan of Norma Payne
Good content
Excellent to see this crap trending next to children's minecraft videos.
The botchamania vince mcmhoan ending for party time is jokes. Top tunes tho absolutely having me in stitches
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Babe, wake up. Sindhu world just posted
PKJ has some solo material and it is dark AF! Choonage as always from the Northern boys 🔥🔥
The next British national anthem 🎉
Slayed again as always lads
Here for my daily until million views
All respect lost
Hell yeah, this slaps!
Legitimately one of my new fave artists makes me so happy every time they release new music ❤️
I love these guys so much.  I know this just dropped but I'm excited for more!  Keep up the awesome work, boys!
Truly iconic!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
you're so fucking good
Anybody supporting trans rights from Terf Island is a fucking hero, god bless
on my hands and knees begging you to tour in the u.s.
Get a logo so I can fucking tattoo it already! 🔥🤘🔥
Come to Canada lol. This is amazing 🤣👍
Amazing music, would love to see an international tour one day!!
Damn they more supportive than my parents will ever be
This makes the line about being up all night on Reddit in Normans other song make a lot more sense...
No, you don't gotta love them, no matter how much the media, politicians, celebrities, and anyone who is pandering in order to become successful tells you that you need to love a bunch of delusional narcissists with made up genders.
BIG BALD MEN
i love you guys, please keep doing you
One time for everyone in between you got to love them... Especially the baldies
im hurting, stop it im realy hurting  THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME!
absolutely fucking iconic. i'll love you three until I die
If the northern boys have 0 fans im dead
IT'S THE MYTH THE LEGEND KEVIN.... They've done it again this beautiful piece of wrinkly perfection
another absolute banger
they hit my gender envy spot on with the scuttle like a beetle line
love it
Another Northern Boys banger 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
that's some good shit
Mate fucking legends 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Get this shit on Beat Saber
Norm who's your MUA... I'm jealous
this video genuinely just turned my entire year around for the better, thank you SO much for making this holy shit
from buying 2 pints for a trans man to enjoying your own expression. you can keep your pints this is way better
I’m in love 🎉😂❤
😂
Love this ❤
yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I need it on Apple Music 😢😫
All I know is nobody fucks with Kev. For the next banger video, I request the 3 of you perform somewhere really uncomfortable for you, just keep recording. We want the Pain under the skirt. Don't stop
I LOVE THIS
Looking ahead to see what Maffew does with this for the latest Botchamania...go do it windjammer!!!
Trans and working class and this is my new fave anthem
The northern boys are icons who have never made a bad track
Just spend way to long dancing around my house to this , such a banger 😎
the greatest gift the lgbtq+ community could ask for, keep expressing yourself boys.
I love these men so much
Every drop better than the last.
Every single video of yours has me bouncing with the tune and smiling from ear to ear 🧡
Fucking legends
Northern boys don't fuck around.
Absolutely love it the best modern day song by far
I need a number 3 after all that...
somewhere MCA is in heaven smiling down on the northern boys: the new clown princes of hip hop
0:52 So good of Roy Walker to take part.
Bro my turtle literally died last night but this has cheered my ass up
Dude it's clipping, are you deaf?
This is jokes 😆
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
if i don't hear this at every pride i go to in the future i will face God and walk backwards into Hell
This has such mass appeal. I'm taking it as the joke it is, but i bet there are many LGBTP types bumping this inironically
Very good! Very good indeed
fockin ell
You guys are a fucking revelation ❤. Love from Ireland.
That Cracked me up !! Lmao🤣
I really hope someone who has no knowledge of Pete and Bas and The Northern Boys stumble on this video... They aren't gonna have a fecking clue whats going on hahaha. Amazing work chaps
Fucking brilliant
When I grow up I wanna be this
best song
Absolutely incredible!!!! Bloody love it! 😂
Yes Norma
I fucking love it ❤❤
Norman pain goated since day one ❤❤❤❤🎉
Fucking ICONIC
I love it! 😂
I love everything about this song. Excellent work, definitely adding this to my Pride playlist.
All three of these men have had their way with my wife and I cannot thank them enough.
Y’all need to go to the club at 3am not 3pm
Norman in this has awakened desires in me I never knew I had. Seriously. *fans self to keep from swooning*
YEAAHH BROTHERS!
Norman is absolutely SERVING in this one, you love to see it!
Weak for them
That's, Class Lads.
This song slaps so fucking hard!
Iiiiiiiconic ❤❤
i give it three weeks before every gay club is blastin this
Not as good as the last 2 but still entertaining! I'm mostly here for Kev's dancing anyway!
TALK VALENTINA
I'm stagnated. This video stalls the momentum of an otherwise great movement.  By movement, I speak of the enabling and realization that old folks have bars and can be relevant. I love all of them. I love Pete and Bas.  I recognize the separation and drift of creative license. However, the production value became too hasty too quickly and I see many steps backwards and the lyrical writing became too serious too quickly.  Northern boys released two products that were instant success due to their meme value and self deprecating lyrics.  There was no transition between that and this justifying anything other than a hostile takeover or a total shift of ideas.    I'd still like to hear what your mum has to say.  Ask her to add some minutes on her phone so she can FaceTime me later.
Norman is such a complex and brilliant artist. If any of you haven’t looked into his solo work, do so.
Let it be known if I ever become a drag artist this is gonna be my debut performance song. Absolutely amazing and unbelievably groovy!! forever a new queer anthem for me
the gays 🤝 the bi’s 🤝 the trans 🤝 the girls 🤝 the big bald men
The boys have finally been let inside a building
I just stopped drinking for the night, but now I feel like I have to drink to this song!
You deliver, again.
Number 24 trending let's get to number one big up 🇬🇧🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
Love the band, but I think their other two songs were better
fuck yea boys rack em up! love this banger!!
thank you for dropping the ally club anthem of the year
gonna just run this on loop for a few hours
Don't mind me, just feeding the algorithm
Bro I cannot stress how insane these bars are "1, 2, 3, to the bastard 4 My ex wife is a bastard whore"  Fucking unholy the way these guys rip these beats into pieces with an aggressive yet poetic lyrical interjection
I FUCKING LOVE THE NORTHERN BOYS I AM SO HAPPY YOU MADE THIS THANK YOU NORMAN PAIN FOR EXPRESSING YOURSELF!!!!!!!
Incredible absolute LEGENDS
Older4Me: The Musical
MAGNIFICENT! I LOVE YOU GUYS AAAA !!!!!! <3 <3 <3
thankyou northen boys for being the realest allies of the queer community
being a recovering alcoholic and Northern Boys fan is a VERY hard line to walk
Played this at half time of last night's bingo
🔥🔥🔥 pure heat from the northern boys
Absolute fucking tune
Damn I love these guys - flawless
Fucking love you guys, couldn't have put this out at a better time either. Legednds, all of you!

Beyonce needs to clear this sample ASAP
Northern Boys slaying it.
This made my day, just went back into hospital now I have a new song to blast ❤
Waitin' for the JK Rowling diss track to drop. 🙏
Feel Good Hit of the Summer.
Thank you Nothern Boys, I really needed that energy right now in my life
these men bring me so much joy its unreal
This should have two billion views
🎉🎉🎉
This is the kind of old man i strive to become
I love the Northern Boys.
This makes me wanna tuck in my inch worm and dance the night away, as Florence Henderson.
I just discovered your music and I'll be real, your songs were nothing like I expected but you're genuinely fucking great. Kinda disappointed in myself that I haven't heard of you before
song goes hard. outro goes harder.
Fucking propper!
Amazing, no words. Thank you for this!
Another inclusive banger!!!
When the album drops, it will be a body of work The Beatles or Mozart wished they had made
I f-ing love these guys.
The love and energy these men inspire is incredible
You know this is going to be a heavy club track in years ti come.
Ally northern boys???
This is nowhere near as good as the first two
Ha smashed it with this one ,well done you mental geriatrics
bald man looks so uncomfortable :DDD
Absolute fucking music royalty, this lot. This is so wild even my 63 year old dad is jamming to it.
You look amazing norm ❤
Waiting for this to be on Spotify 🥰
Ive been a diehard fan since you bought me (a transgender man) two pints
Rate the pro LGBTQ lyrics here, love to see it
Kev's consistency is unmatched.
Awesome! A few more songs and we got an album that will never stop repeating.
I fucken love it you beautiful cunt 🍻 Love from Australia.
Wyld moves by Kev.

You have no idea how much I love you guys! Another Northern Boys song just made my fucking week!
quickest wank of my life
Friday night, Northern Boys and a few bumps, we're off 🚀
Subtly making a violence-based support track for the gender-fluid/non-binary folkx. Well done.
1:48 yall are just so epic ahahaha💗💗💗🫶
Genius.  Thanks guys.
banger
20 quid says despite being accommodating for everybody, they still get cancelled anyway.

Norman is selling himself short, a million + for sure!
Man these guys are the best, my new pride anthem
What a banger lads 🤣🔥👏
Wildly hilarious, while also being sincerely pro LGBT. Incredible stuff, guys.
This is the kind of energy I want more of in the world, chaotic and unapologetic support for everyone in the LGBTQIA+ community
Another grammy worthy hit. Smashed the performance.
As one of the in between people I approve of this song! Keep smashing out bangers like this we love you! 💜
Finally a song to show my friends how mental the LGBTQ group is. To be fair, other songs are 10/10, but this one is trash
if the bar about fisting trans men in the last song didn’t achieve it, the boys really weeded out the transphobes with this one.
babe wake up new trans anthem just dropped
If this doesn’t prove The Northern Boys never miss then I don’t know what does 🫡
you boys are legends, mon over to belfast
This is absolutely fire 🔥.
What does Sindhu mean?
This is awesome, thank you.
LOVE YOU NORMAN <3 <3 <3 BIG UPS TO KEV AND PKJ AS WELL MUCH LOVE <3
Norman looks really fucking good in the dress
I think the pride song for this summer is on lockdown right here lads 😎 "and if you don't like it you can fuck off!"
Welp, I'm truly scared. I'll be adding this to my daily listening
I just found out about these guys from botchamania and a new song now?  Great
I love them.
ONE TIME FOR THE LADIES ONE TIME FOR THE MEN ONE TIME FOR EVERYONE IN BETWEEN, YES YOU GOTTA LOVE THEM
I hope we'll hear the other guy one day the should be training him so he can lol sound brilliant an a shock
My appr3ciation of norm as d3fo changed lol
🎉 be true to yourself.  You lose yourself expressing something you’re not.
Get these lads to Eurovision
Back to form- another winner
Iconic
i cant stop listening to this
This is my first time experiencing The Northern Boys. Instant obsession.
Excellent. Keep up the good work boys.
I cant wait to shake my ass to this at the club thanks boys
What are the northern boys pronouns
Certified hood classic. Y'all are the best.
Nothing makes me happier than The Northern Boys shouting out us non-binary folks! <3
If I could marry a video it would be this
NORTHERN BOYS SAID TRANS RIGHTS OR ELSE
THE BOYS ARE BACK!!!
Brilliant!
ABSOLUTE BANGER, BOYS
absolute Fire!
If this song is not played at every Pride Celebration I will actually call a meeting of the gay agenda team and everyone who committed the heinous act of not playing it will be prosecuted for hate crimes. I said what I said.
Y'all are amazing
These boys should be representing us at Eurovision.
I love pete and bas and the northern boys because they fill me with nothing but hope for the future
Permanent jam right here. This song makes me so happy.
This is such a good song unironically
Norman is the British Trevor Phillips
Move over Harry Styles, this is what really allies look like 😍 😍 😍
I got an STD listing to this.
The pronoun verse is unironically the best bars I’ve ever heard
Need an American tour ASAP!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It is not fair that I can like this video only once.
I need a drag queen to perform to this song
Wait, is that Roy Walker on 53 seconds?!
The Boys dont miss.
You guys are fucking great.
Fist two were great.  Sad that they have gone down the route of crossdressing and talking about trans or bi issues...  We want crude depressed old men. Not a dude dressed as a woman.  This appeals to like barely a percentage of their audience
Su-fucking-perb!!!!!  Love it.
£30 to the soul who gets this on the karaoke machines in my town
This is far more than any of us deserve
fuckin legends
"One time for the ladies" etc is just a monster of a fucking hook
Weirdly beautiful track. Now on repeat. Love it. ❤
Norman dancing so confidently in heels makes me think this isnt the first time he's done it and i am here for it
Norman Pain is my new idol
Be you trans, gay, non-binary, whatever you may be, I will never hate you as much as I hate my wife.
Maybe England still has some hope, another fkin banger lads x
this fucking slaps!!
Based 👑
that's great !
that ending clip is everything. i love you guys sm.
Well this is the most curious woke song
My new favorite rap group
Northern boys single-handedly saving trans rights in the UK, love to see it~
😂geezas are killing it been consistent these are no joke
tranny anthem represent
Jesus wept 😂😂😂😂😂 wt actual fk
Fucking love you guys
Thats a drag show people would line up to see.
Northern Boys Changing the Game Again 😅
I was in Iraq and ordered a gimp mask as a joke/it took like 6 months to show up and came labeled as "fancy dress" god bless haha
I can’t believe it’s March but we’ve already found the song of the summer
Everyone knows the best night out is down the Working Men's club.
Kevin's moves on point as always!
My new anthem, cheers
Spotify please😊
tamps
This is relateable
When are you gigging again? We need a tour
Proper Northerners!!!!! 🤘 "And if you don't like it, you can f@ck off!".......brilliant 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💖
God, Norman Pain, you're awesome 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 brilliant 👏
Yet another SLAY
I can't wait for the album to drop
They have the hypest hypeman that has ever hyped.
The Northern Boys say Trans rights
I wish these guys and Pete and Bas weren’t a fraud. Fun songs though.
Now this is ally-ship 💖
This is everything
This is absolutely incredible ❤🎉 love it!
I could listen to this for hours
when is it on spotify?
I hanged myself in the neighbor's garden, when he came home it was a nice surprise. Stretched my neck out and made me brain-dead, it's a real pity I survived.
This is the best, I've converted all my mates to old fella rap and they all love it. Another certified hood classic lads.
Hell yes.
1 2 3 to the bastard 4... blood had me dying!
very powerful energy you wield here
Norm obvs felt so overshadowed by Kev's dancing prowess that he had a glow up
I love you boys, thank you for making this music ❤❤❤❤
This is my new fave pride song
THIS is British pride
Nah this one sucks
slay
ANOTHER BANGER AS ALWAYS
Lost my job this week and don't know how I'll make rent, but then I heard new northern boys dropped and everything is okay again 😅
Been waiting what feels like forever for this song and damn was it worth it!!! God i love these guys! Love from Africa!
Another certified Northern Boys banger
That club was popping off.
I love this so much!
Love it
LITERALLY SCREAMED WHEN I SAW A NEW SONG
But after hit, banger after banger. This song rules
‘the gays, and the bis and the trans and the girls and the big bold men’ is poetry
Absolute banger but could we get some cowbell
YESSSSSSS
This brought me joy on a shitty day, thank you northern boys!! Need this on Apple Music asap
casual enby fan not expecting to be Seen today????? thank you guys so much for this. it means a lot.
I love yall for this one... but that ending gave me a laugh I so desperately needed! Thanks dudes.
Yknow I didn’t expect that a song featuring an old man in drag from terf island to actually be supportive of the lgbt community but I’m actually really glad. Nice one mates, I’ll be sure to share it to my fellow queer folk
Blood pumping like a newborn cow
I just discovered y'all and I'm blasting this on repeat as I rock out in the shower
Hype
Best ally anthem since CupcakKe, God bless
Not quite the banger as the other two- but it’s so unashamedly Pro Queer I couldn’t give a fuck
The fact that y'all are standup on consent and queer pride just makes me so fucking happy. Love your work fellas, if we're going to judge art by authenticity then y'all are solid 10s, and the tunes are genuine bangers to boot.
My fav band
Some of the best bangers in the last 10 yrs!!
Legendary… as always.
These guys are fucking brilliant!!! New dimensions to them with every new song drop. “One time for everyone in between, yes you gotta love them!” ❤ ❤ ❤ “This is me expressing myself and if you don’t like it you can FUCK OFF!!!” 💥
you beautiful bastards. this is everything I didn't know I needed
THE NORTHERN BOYS DO NOT MISS, GOD DAMN
I'm really glad PKJ's working on their self esteem.
This is a masterpiece
Norm ROCKING the dangly earrings
This pretty good
Wake up babe, the northern boys said queer rights 🎉❤
Hell yeah boys the best pride song I’ve ever heard
🫥Its........🫨so.........🥹beautiful.......🦻💦
Yes lads! just waiting for the day Kev gives us a massive verse!
The 70 your old man overdosing on cocaine in the bowling alleys bathroom support's trans people! diversity win!  Seriously though become one of my favorite bands and seeing this song  of support does actually mean a lot
this is allyship
i live for this
GO OFF KINGSSSSSSSSS FUCK EM UPPP
Absolute legends 🔥🔥🔥
how can this be so filthy and yet so wholesome 🥹
Absolutely loving it
When they said they “listen up pal, I could die right now” I really felt that
TO THE GAYS AND THE BIS AND THE TRANS AND THE GIRLS AND THE BIG BALD MEN
That ending from Norman had me fuckin die laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣
alright ill fuck off now
THE NORTHERN BOYS TRANS RIGHTS QUEER ANTHEM LETS FUCKING GO
ART
Based pro trans rights boomers ❤
Every one a goddamn banger
The counting verse was fire
This song is the sound of thousands of eggs hatching.

Eminem has nothing on the Northern Boys ANOTHER FUCKING BANGER LADS
SEND THEM TO EUROVISION 😭😍
Norma Pain?! ❤ Love you guys.
It's official. 2023 belongs to The Northern Boys.
People: "Eminem is too old to rap"  Northern Boys: "Hold our pepperminths"
Jesus christ I love you all so much. Every time you release a song I literally listen to it like 40 times a day
thanks boys
If I don't see you guys at Eurovision I'm going to riot
If i'm even in the area Norm is free to fist me without having to buy me a drink first.
there is another reason to live: the northern boys (gender neutral) will keep making music
We love an ally
god damn I love every song you produce more than the last, keep being THE BEST!!!!
Hell yes 🕺 trans masc here loving the representation
Fkn brilliant.  Express yourself lads 👍
Excellent track with a great message. Northern Boys just can't miss.
Fuckin eh Northern Boys.  Upbeat brash and bawdy globally accepting attitude. Love it. Reminds me of Norman's line in Party Time: "Can I Spaff on your booblays?" "Feel free to say no" everyone is accepted with utmost respect.  Except Norman's ex.
You beautiful bastards, you've done it again
Another classic banger, 10/10 for the trans positivity
Norman is a fucking icon
PRIDE AF🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈💙
Norman Pain for the next season of Drag Race, fuck it
the northern boys are the progressive kings we need
The allies of all time
Never knew I needed to see Norm absolutely killing it in some high heels until now
HELL YES LADS!
Oh absolutely yes
fuck yeah we stan some progressive kings
Fu kin kings.
This is going places I wasn't expecting but I'm here for it.
An amazing shoutout and an amazing song
This music video is banned in Florida
You guys should release the instrumental version of your songs as well! The beats are amazing.
i too have lost the plot, but i feel so blessed to be alive to witness this magic.
The writers really know their target audience 🤭
WOOO Telling everyone that the Northern Boys dropped a new hit
I needed another ally anthem so urgently
You inclusive bastards. Love it.
I'm gagging
This music video would be illegal in Massachusetts
Absolute banger again
Single handedly redeeming your entire generation and I aint fuckin about.
YES, another tune to add to my Pete, Bad, Norman Pain and others,

As an inbetween I appreciate the shout-out 🏳️‍🌈
😮😮😮😮
Its a damn shame how norman is selling out like this.
This is incredible. I love this video, I love this song, and I love all of you. Thank you, from a non-binary fan.
Norman crushing it as always ❤
Up the northern boys
Nonbinary rep!! Love you boys dearly, keep expressing yourselves! 💜🥰🏳️‍🌈
Unreal, gwan the northern boys
LGBT anthem and Geriatric Hip-Hop were not two genres I ever expected to cross over but here I am watching Norman Pain do drag while PKJ implies he's genderqueer. Sure why not.
Hit after fucking hit lads🤙
Legends. Absolute legends.
"This is the pride anthem of 2023!!" declaration made by an actual lesbian
Never stop 😂❤
Art
Honey, wake up. New Northern Boys just dropped
Northern boys said trans rights!!!
Weak
This is terrible
Big respect for being inclusive <3
This brings me so much joy for so many reasons.
As a Nonbinary Queer person who loves your music fucking thank you <3
Bloody fucking amazing lads. Much love from here in the deep shit that is the southern USA.
Jelly Bean puff
Fuck yeah, guys! I love this so much! Keep being you, because you rock! 🤩
SOUND OF THE BASTARD SUMMER!!!
new pride anthem.
Starting with Kev dancing, I know it’s going to be good.
So true
The closing comment is absolutely fucking iconic. It's not my style of music at all, but I've got a massive silly grin on my face after listening to it and I don't know why. I'll have to listen again to work out why :P
You guys are my favorite
Subscribing to this channel was prolly the best idea ive ever had <3
Norman turned pub land lord 😂
Loooooool oiiii oiiiiii🎉
You’re move Botchamania
It feels illegal to be this early
Diversity takes a new level and some beaut acronyms. Epic.
"Aww look, a gender inclusive song....."  Imagine being in 2015 and reading these comments?
This is how i imagine a bisexual puppet show
I'm literally crying, this might be the best song in existence
They just can't miss
Legends
Well f**k me sideways, Norm & crew are woke kings/queens! That’s not a sentence I ever expected to say. I f**king love it.
We need a full length album soon please! Love this track and video.
I love this :D
Northern boys always go hard when they drop a new classic
Best new music in last decade.
Pecking at her crotch like a free range hen is genius. Bars for days.
That's house chords!  Norman and his send for us!  Legend for live
THEY DON'T MISS! Love me some Northern Boys!
The boys bestowing us with absolute heat once again 🔥
YYEESSSSSSS
Another instant classic
A little ray of sunshine peaks through the clouds here on Terf Island. Well done gents. Beautiful stuff.

Nice leeegs <3
🤘🤘 another fucking banger
geeezahss
These boys are on fire lately....sorry these folk.
Hard to watch?  No. Hard whilst watching? Mind your own business.
Thailand's national anthem
Beautiful work again boys
Norman Pain says trans rights
Oh hell! They still got it. Filthy, furious, dark and dirty. This is my jam.
First, consent Second, trans rights Now, LGBTQ+ pride  We love to see it, lads
Yet another great one, lads!
BIG BALD MEN GOES SO HARDDDDDDDDDDDD EUGHHHHHGHGHGHGHGHGHGH
I was not expecting a pro lgbtq+ song from you guys.  Love it!  Keep these hood certified jams coming
M8 as if my non -binary arse couldnt love them more they drop this.
The Northern Boys are literally more pro-trans than every British political party
Absolute fuckin legends
These guys really do love boot cut jeans.
Absolutely iconic! Unexpectedly feel like this is the best representation for my kind of queerness I’ve seen in media. Cheers and thank you guys!
ALSO WOW THE THEY/THEM PRESENTATION I CANT I LOVE YOU ALL SO MUCH
Whats with this company always using old guys in their vids ? It's clearly the same voice as pete n bas or whatever there name is lol it's just wierd
This is the best as always. Sometimes I feel like my life won't move fast enough, or I'm missing out on success. But y'all, y'all make me feel more secure knowing I can be a g in my golden years too.
Fuck yes northern boys! Get hyped. This is the only album I want to drop in 2023! Fucking best God damn mother fucking rap crew around fight me.
Norman is the only person who can flawlessly pull off the maniac bum, disheveled poet and drag queen aesthetics, all while keeping the exact same energy.  The boys are legend 👏🏻👏👏
Upstairs neighbor is about to go mad fr, sorry for the foreseeable future
How this is not on their channel but is here?
No notes. 10/10
TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNNNNNNNNNSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHTTTTTTTTTTTTTSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Amazing. Love it.
these boys continued commitment to lgbtq+ rights is brilliant

NORMAN THE GOAT
Kev seems to me like the kind of guy who doesn't listen to the lyrics and just feels the groove.
This is bonkers and I love everything about it. I host karaoke and can't wait to share this with the audience.
was so excited for this song after it was announced and you guys never miss, another banger to be added to my playlist.

You be you every song you guys put out is amazing
Look how they massacred my boy 😂🤝
Whilst I'm grinning and crying, I'm also speechless! Shock value - 99. Rated - I don't think there's a letter you can put to this.  The Northern Boys are an incoming tsunami, but instead of running you stay rooted to watch and listen!
This is fucking brilliant, the northern boys just drop banger after banger. You boys are absolutely beautiful, I love y’all!!
NORMAN PAAAAAAIIIIINNNN

Not one to brag but I am solely responsible for 90%  of the current views thus far
Vulgar, introspective, and queer! The Northern Boys have done it again! 🏳‍🌈🏳‍⚧
i messed up and took mushrooms today.. but seeing this tripping has been so worth it!
Iconic
gay rights
This is a piece of Art
Music with a message.
LETS GOOOOO
Yes KINGS!
🔥
Not all heroes wear capes
Admit it : This isnt good. Pete and Bas : OK..... but this is just some old guys who cant rap wearing women's clothes.... this isnt a good look at all
The boys just can’t be stopped
Pure fire
Excuse my sexiness…
How do we get the Northern Boys on Dictionary Corner?
How arousing
gets wilder and weirder by each video i love it 🤣🤣🔥
northern boys say trans lives matter, love em
Norma Pain
The Northern Boys feel like disassociating on a bad shroom trip  that outro is unreasonably based
Life goals never looked this good
Yeeeessss, Nothern Boys says TRANS RIGHTS 👏👏👏  absolute legends ♥️
They don't miss folks
NORTHERN BOYS WORLDWIDE SWEEP!!!!
hell yes
Oh my god Norman what are you doing LMAO
Norman is iconic in the black pumps, dress, earrings and leopard print silk undies. Lighting doesn’t strike the same place once, it strikes three times and keeps goin.
Trans anthem
MAGNIFICENT WORK BOYS
Norman passes more convincingly than most blokes that throw on a wig and a bit of rouge and demand to be allowed to hang out in the bathroom at the local elementary school.
can you guys please please please do a cover of "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)" except maybe as "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Shag After Midnight)"?
I had a huge grin on my face during this video great one lads haha love it
So progressive! Very good to see them keeping up with the times.
What a weirdly trans positive song lmfao  Based anyway, another banger
fanfuckingtastic as always, boys
That was so fire and so hilarious at the same time 🔥😂
Awesome song! Hope it gets added to spotify soon!
🏳‍⚧🏳‍⚧🏳‍⚧🏳‍⚧🏳‍⚧🏳‍⚧🏳‍⚧

Damn who did his makeup 👀
Most politically correct song of 2023! 😂
Well worth the bastard wait!
Norman looking cute as always
another song to repeat forever
Imagine walking into a working mens club and seeing this 😂
Fair play to you guys it's good to see you doing what you want most people think you get to a age and you shouldn't do that keep doing what you are doing your alot better than most
One time for the Ladies one time for the Men!
NORMAN! 😂
10 sec
Woooooo
❤❤❤❤
The Northern Boys are the physical incarnation of Viz Magazine
I am unashamed by how much I've listened to the last two songs. Some examples of lyrics that made people I know spit out drinks:  Call me grandad cos I fucked your nan  Bought a transgender man two pints, can I get lucky and fist him tonight  Having a gangbang to Jackson 5  I dip my dick in a salsa dip  Amazing.
It’s how I imagine people felt waiting for Beethoven to perform.
Why isn’t it time to release this song yet?
Hyped!!!
Let's go
Yes nowwww
me and all my homies love the northern boys
LESS GOO
I kept thinking that they have to be putting another hit out soon. I'm so pumped for this
Hype 💯
why is Norman wearing a bra?
Can't wait :)
Holy hell
But we are gonna see a Sindhu Sesh from Norman before long right?
Yuuusssssss
Can't wait for Kev and his sweet moves to be back
2 pints and I'd be game
I'm so excited. The Northern Boys only produce 🔥.
finally, another song to have on repeat endlessly
ya no
waltuh..
