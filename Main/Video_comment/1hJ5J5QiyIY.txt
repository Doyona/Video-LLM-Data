Peak nation peak song peak story
Definition of peak❤
I can't get over fountain even after soo long.. before natlan, I was hoping pls be better than fountain that's all you need.. still hoping for Shnezhnaya.. PLZ BE BETTER THAN FOUNTAIN!!!
Think it's still the peak even after Luna act 1 and 2 resealing
This was recommended to me.. ah, the good old Fontaine days
This song popped up in my playlist and man the memories came flooding back this is one of the best trailers genshin has ever made
Wdym Fontaine was two years ago 🥲
Here after nodkrai livestream, btw Childe will return:)
God, I miss Fontaine quest so much! (especially after total disaster with Natlan) Fontaine is indeed the GOAT! 💔
Watching this after Nod Krai Luna 1 trailer, but somehow this trailer will always be special to me! Truly amazing.
Watching this trailers almost 2 years later, the way everything was edited and framed is pure genius. The trailer paints a decieving story of the traveler attempting murder on Lynette and being put on trial, just as Focalors decieved the Heavenly Principles. Absolute genius.
Wow, I genuinely can't believe it's been 2 years since Fontaine. It feels like just yesterday I was doing the archon quest around Christmas time, now it's time to prep for nod kraal
oh, it’s been 2 years?
It's been 2 years already  DAMN it seems like it was just yesterday Will always be peak Whole Genshin is PEAK
Its been 2 years yall
Natlan was better tbh
nowhere else to climb after fontaine so genshin decided to jump off
ts was so good
Genshin peaked here
Best region
Who are we🍴🎉🧑🏻‍🍳 ?Left or right, we always blink, We speak in flashes — quick, not pink! We warn your moves with shiny flair, But most forget we’re even there… 😤
Who's here after dainsleif natlan archon quest?
peak
Sumeru walked so Fontaine could run. Both were awesome! Then there was Natlan….😢
0:20 OMG is that me or does Furina have Damoclece's Sword on her undersole? 💀
sumeru and fontaine was truly for the literate people
Still the best trailer of the game
This was so peak..
I can't move on from this trailer
Fontane was so peak i had to come back and re watch this
After peak sumeru and peak fontaine, genshin need another peak
peak
it's still to this day one of my most favorite trailers. The editing and music are just great.
Peak Genshin
Nah natlan is better 🔥, Fontaine was so underwhelming
Free minet
Watching this after Natlan really just makes me hate how little effort they put into Natlan’s story  Extremely baity too 😕
7
Fontaine was such a success, none of the regions so far gave me so much fun as this one
I miss this era so bad
Fontaine revived genshin, only for natlan to kill it.
I miss Fontaine it indeed was the peak in everything from character, story,  music, i can't wait to get out of Natlan. Even though I love the exploration, the story and character are boring expect for some, plus Natlan world quests are so much more interesting.  Nod krai looks interesting, hoping that it won't disappoint like Natlan.
Even after watching natlan I'll still say there's no comparison between fontaine and other nations....
Miss this SO much, so peak
what an era 😭😭
I hate the fact that I quit after the sumeru released and I came back too late…
I miss this era💔
God I love Fontaine sm❤❤❤❤
i remember how hyped everyone was for fontaine. they did NOT dissapoint.
I miss this, better than Natlan~
Bro this trailer was better and best compared to Natlan Story 😢 why.... 😢
😅😅😅
❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Without reason you say?  War without reason?  Ultrakilled reference?
take me back to when this dropped
Here after the Natlan “finale”, after 5.3 and I only have one thing to say.  THIS is how you do an Archon Quest, Genshin. Not whatever Natlan was, with its ups but also its enormous downs.  Fontaine still peak, let’s hope for Snezhnaya
Hi
Now that Fonatain is over and Natlan just finished up, I think I can safely say that  this region was the hardest hoyo has EVER cooked.
genshin prime
The peak of Genshin
2025 anyone?
This was PEAKK❤❤❤
Still one of the best archon quests I had.
yup can surely say this, they truly peaked with fontaine right there, natlan gives another sumeru vibes.....natlan by no means is bad , but fontaine was just so good
Still best region istg Natlan fumbled in my opinion
bring me back to Fontaine Bro even tho it been 1 hole year watching this again gave me exactment
0:19 best part
Man I thought I miss Inazuma a lot but looking it back at it fountain  but I never realised it😭
i miss this era sooo much 🫤
Idk if it's already revealed, but who is this 2:51 "I'm... Wait, who am I?"
looking back  yeah Fontaine had it all
4:28  What a joke childe, you got epic ending like mavuika and capitano but in game you just a clown .  Seriously i think will be neuvillete vs childe before . Like mavuika vs capitano
aspect ratio + atmospheric + good editing + show too many cutscenes
This trailer is one of the best they've made, and I'm here from the 5.3 future. This is beautiful, mysterious, full of drama, worry, fear even. Intrigue. Shows off characters, gameplay, and absolutely gorgeous scenery.
2:05 same here, I want to do the same.
1:46 Where is this location? I don't remember visiting it
Natlan was a letdown compared to this 💀
after natlan???
Where's Wriothesley?
I CAMR BACK TO SEE NEUVILLETTE
This hits different after Natlan’s release
Genshin had reached its peak at Archon Quest 4.0-4.2
IT’S ALREADY BEEN ONE YEAR
3.0 and 4.0 trailers easily clear 5.0
best region 💙
Top 7 vendidas de humo más descaradas en la historia de Genshin Impact: Top 1 El Teser de Fontaine
Fontaine definetly felt differently from natlan 😔😔
i cant believe its already been a year since fontaines release
I LOVED Fontaine! Definitely had the best story line yet, and even compared to what we have now in Natlan it’s still my favourite archon quest.
1:05 did he just wink while winking
It feels like yesterday...
it seem yestrday...
The music✨ I don’t think anything can top Fontaine for me 😭
7118 Rashad Rapids
"Thank you Fontaine, May Furina reign forever"
I don't see how they'll ever top fontaine
I can't believe it's already been a year.
Those drums at the end... 10/10
Goodbye Fontaine~!
Can't believe its been a year now since this trailer dropped, time seriously flies
God I already miss Fontaine
Goodbye, Fontaine. It’s been a lot of fun.
FONTAINE LITERALLY CAME OUT YESTERDAY IM GONNA CRY😭😭
ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS WAS ALREADY A YEAR AGO? NOW I’LL ALSO BE IN COLLEGE 😭
I miss 😭
Natlan is upon us a few hours
а ведь это было год назад...
Watching this before Natlan. Fontaine was amazing.
thank you Fontaine for the memories! Now off to NATLAN!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you for the memories, Fontaine.  Now we're going to the nation of unga bunga
Already over a year...
Te extraño Fontaine por favor llévenme de regreso a cuando vi este tráiler por primera vez
THIS WAS A YEAR BACK??
AINT NO WAY THIS WAS A YEAR AGO??1!//,;5:,(5:6,65(2,56;,25;6/,45,:
I can't even compare natlan's trailer to this state of an art... Pyro region dissapointed me fr
This was 1 year ago already omg
How time flies.. Nathan coming in 6 more days!
i can't believe its been a year already, fointaine was so amazing 🥲
I just came here after watching the Natlan trailer and I feel absolutely dissapointed. 🤡
WHO'S HERE AFTER 6.0 SNEZHNAYA TRAILER
Sorry Natlan trailer but due to element reactions, Hydro > Pyro
Oh wait why is lyney kinda hot
Oh how much I love Furina even tho she is dead-
still the best trailer and music
I feel like this only came out a week ago. Were already going to Natlan soon. 😭🙏
Who is here after the 5.0 Natlan trailer?
Who’s here after the 5.0 TRAILER
after watching the 5.0 livestream im afraid i was correct🙂 nothing can top Fontaine
0:36 I’d never be able to hear that music the same way again after 4.2
1 ano...
duhh rasanya baru kemarin ya😢
fontaine's seems like yesterday...
Coming back here after watching Genshin version 5.0 Natlan expansion livestreaming
This is indeed a finale!
HERE AFTER SNEZHNAYA TRAILER!!!!!!!
it's been 1 year huh
man how did we reach the end of fontaine already
Didn't realise it's been 1 year and time goes by so fast😢
i can't believe Fontaine is over, this is so sad! Fontaine has a special place in my heart, Fontaine felt like home. <3
Here after the Natlan Teaser!
Who came here after the natlan Livestream?
the fact that its been a year already and natlan is just around the corner is so crazy
Lyney te amo.
eu server, team "ain't gonna sleep" or "just a nap"?
Who’s watching before 5.0 trailer???
time really flies huh...
I cannot believes its been a year... i remember clearly when i stayed up till 4am to play the 4.0 version 😭
I love how well these trailers completely obscure the actual plot. Especially 2.2's, everything's framed to completely mislead the viewer
O chocolate da cacau gostoso mais cremoso leite quero mais lá creme o chocolate da cacau show gostoso mais cremoso
danm its been already a year, heck i remeber when 4.0 came
I just release the first song is another version of “sinner’s finale”. they started and ended the story with this song OMG
I joined during the second half of 4.0, exploring Fontaine was extremely fun and was my first area fully explored!  Im now currently AR58 with everything 100% (except the chasm above and under)
nostalgia...
BEST REIGON X.0 LIVESTREAM EVER 😭😭😭
WHO'S HERE AFTER SNEZHNAYA 6.0 Trailer??
Been a year already. Treasure the time, people :(
One year ago Genshin dropped the best Version Trailer so far.
*IT'S BEEN A YEAR ALREADY⁉️* 😭😭
Mentally im stilm here
Its been a year, im crying
1 year❤
this is a FREE game
Dang the music in the beginning hits different now😭
People here in 4.8 for the nostalgia 👇
Nathan trailer look so mid compare to this
How misleading this trailer was..
Natlan didn't make up with my expectation after watching trailer 😭😭😭🤧 Fontaine will be the best region
L’un de mes trailers préférés 🥰
Come here before natland release. Furina sure is the best character Genshin has ever created
Neuvilette carried,i love his character so much:)
inazuma will always be the hypest nation. fountain will always be the best nation. sumeru sits in-between and natlan is pretty ok ig. mond and liyue will forever be the most iconic nations.
Freminet’s theme is lit 🔥
Midlan could never
Almost a year ago, and this nation is still unmatched
Good bye fountain.welcome natlan 💔💔🗿
Fontaine!!
Han pasado casi once meses y sigo alucinando con lo bien hecho que estaba el trailer. Verlo me hace revivir las expectativas que tenía.
ITS NATLAN TIME NOW Y’ALL OMG
I can't believe that Fontaine released nearly a year ago. Now, we're heading to Natlan in less than two months. Time really does fly by.
That fontaine theme at the start gave me ptsd, in a good way 😭😭
Why did algorithm feed me this is this because of the ignition teaser showing natlan
And now, Time for Natlan Land.
Miss Fontaine 😢
WHO'S HERE AFTER NATLAN TRAILER Edit: WHO'S HERE AFTER NATLAN RELEASE EDITED: WHO'S HERE AFTER 5.1 PLOT TWIST EDITED 2: Who's here after basically everything? Personally, I haven't gotten over Fontaine, it was too good. edited 3, July 2025: I miss Fontaine, nothing will ever be better.
I miss the fontaine release era lool now natlan is almost released
I don't know how Genshin will top this trailer 😭 this trailer is just peak of genshin. I hope Natlan 5.0 trailer will do better
Yup! Fontaine one is better
Just realised lennet is useing chlorinde sword 😮
came back after Natlan's teaser. Well this trailer was absolutely great !
Hello, just a friendly reminder to whoever you are reading this comment right now, that Jesus loves you 💛  (Romans 3:23 NIV) for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,  yet...  (Romans 5:7‭-‬8 NIV) Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.  (John 3:16 NIV) For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.  Your situation might be hard to explain right now, you don't need to fight alone because you are never alone, trust Jesus and he will fight for you, Dear Stranger, God loves you. 💛💓 keep praying and never give up.  The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. Psalms 34:18 NIV https://psalm.bible/psalm-34-18
Скоро год...
i see you going through the newest comments 🕴️
Это было великолепно, но всему приходит конец. Таков закон времени, но это несправедливо потому что это прошло слишком быстро!
crying, bcz this is probably will be the last best region that will be ever released and well written.
It feels like Fontaine just got released like 3 months ago and we're already gonna leave. It was a truly magnificent Archon quest(the best)
Back in my day everyone was screaming how childe was here
Someone rewatching it again before the natlan releases?
Natlan doesn‘t awake my excitement… Fontaine was just LIT. Maybe now only Kaenri‘ah can top it
Been 11 Months and The Presumed "Dottore" Is Not here
Here before Natlan's official trailer gets released. I hope to get as hyped for the Pyro nation!
10 months ago ☹️
THIS WAS 10 MONTHS AGO? 😭😭 HOW TIME HAS PASSED
Fontaine, I will miss you so much 😭😭
Man I can’t believe this was almost a year ago 😭
Now that 4.0 is about to end, it's nice to rewatch this trailer and have a hindsight.
Already having nostalgia from this summer
I just freaking noticed it....0:33 why is Dottore doing there??????????
feels like yesterday
coming back before we get to natlan
Time flies
2 patches left to Natlan. Fontaine is too fast😭
Time passed way too fast in Fontaine wtf the release day still feels like yesterday
The excitement I had for Fontaine was beyond levels lol, fontaine still feels so new, but in reality it released almost a year ago. The story was amazing, emotional and just great. And now, I’m definitely excited for Natlan!
Luego de terminar las misiones de Fontaine la verdad la historia y todo 10/10 ojala q la siguente nacion sea asi
OMGGG THIS BEST TRAILER IN GENSHIN IMPACT🔥I CANT BELIEVE THIS A TRAILER GAME. I LIKE WATCHING FILMS IN CINEMA WITH AMAZING AUDIO AND VISUALS!! Probably in 0:00-1:05
I keep rewatching this thing when it came out idk why
Natlan in 3 months!
I love (Fosolores)s voice
Ok I'm doing this...
i remember when i watched this in china, I was so unimaginably hype
Aqui viene mi mas humilde opinion: Primero que nada cuando aparecio Furina sere diablo coño, demasiada leche sere, de ahi esta to despingao la verdad se ve un relajo tremendo loco osea ponlos a ordenar el cuarto o no se sere, tipo sabes, de aguita pacifica a muerte satanic black negros, tipo sabes. Como decia, Fontaine es good loco, pero sabes que es mas god? Exacto, el puto buscaminas.
what kind of music is playing at 4:06?
HOW HAS IT BEEN 8 MONTHS WHAT
2:52 wait why haven't we seen this part yet
I don't know why genshin devs don't follow the path of this version... 1 new 5 star and 2 new 4 stars per patch. It's a great formula to make the players feel the game is very alive and dynamic. Not what we've been having after this... I wish all the version of genshin were so great like this one.
After 4.2.. It feels so surreal.. I wish we could go back to the day this trailer dropped. Everyone was so excited..
Wait this is already 8 months ago?!
0:35 эта песня... кат сцена с фокалорс
I am still stuck here and its so nostolg8c
It is of the the Lord's mercies we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. Lamentations 3: 22
2:02🩵🤍🐧
Mentally I’m still here
After 4.2 Archon Quest, 0:35 hits different now
6 months already!!
I came here to rewatch... I really LOVE IT!!
I hope the dragons doesn’t destroy the city of Nathlan
En ese trailer creí que Neuvillete sería el villano de esta nación xd como alguien que quisiera robar el puesto de arconte, esque su rostro era muy de villano xd
This trailer never gets old it’s actually fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
God, it's *wild* rewatching this trailer after wrapping the latest quests
Woah
4:19 Finally, Childe learnt how to do a flip jump without breaking his neck (Look Childe's demo at minute 0:20)
.
Japan is GOD
I noticed something. The theme when the characters are shown in every trailer is the same in their demos.
0:19 you can not imagine how astonished i felt when the camera pans out to reveal Fontaine. And at 0:35 when the elegant music kicks in as we first see the Court of Fontaine. Fontaine was the first time i deliberately avoided as many leaks as possible, because i knew Fontaine was going to be my favourite nation. Since the Travail Trailer I yearned for its release and in that moment I was speechless. It was the most rewarding thing I felt in a very long time.
Sepana
its 4.3 and I'm still rewatching this trailer
I don’t play genshin, BUT DAMN, this is pretty good ngl. Lore seems interesting.
Fontaine was released 4 months ago, i miss this patch so much
This trial video is very good with a good mix of cutscene and music
The World is a stage and you are all merely players.
4:35 guess what happen to childe 2 sec after this
Well I’m back. And damn… this quest hurt,
4y ago Jun 9 2019
6.38
I’m still dead at the fact Childe came into fountaine and managed to get himself in jail within like ONLY A FEW DAYS LMAO
After playing the archon quests this trailer leaves a much bigger impression on me. First time when watching it felt kind of lacking and unhype compared with the 2 previous .0 trailers. But now when everything clicks it's just so much better
0:20 I heard this yet...🤔🤔  Oh maybe in monstand
Here is how to get saved and be right with God, who loved us all, for eternal life! 1-Realize that all have sinned before God, in some way or another. Romans 3: 10+23 (KJB)  10. "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:" 23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”  2-Realize that God loved us, even as wicked sinners, enough to allow Jesus to pay the full price for our sins.  Romans 5: 8-9 (KJB)  8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." 9."Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."  Romans 6: 23 (KJB) “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”   3-Confess unto God asking to be forgiven of your sins by this free gift of forgiveness, given freely to whosoever does so.  Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB) 9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” 10."For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." 13."For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB) 27."And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:" 28."So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”  Revelation 21: 8 (KJB) "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”  -Lastly An example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.  “Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving.  I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me.  I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ. I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins.  I trust in him alone to save me.  Nothing else.  Not my good works or anything else.  Only Jesus.  I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”
who is here after act 5? what a journey
'To the people of Fontaine the line between a trial and a performance can be a little blurred.' Well, now we know why!
I can’t believe focalor’s theme is at the start. I’m still sad from that cutscene and the music doesn’t help its just so sad now
anyone knows the bgm when childe is activating foul legacy?
A few things I have to say after the Archon Quests  — SPOILERS —       After the last archon quest, I realized that (during the first Archon Quest) it’s no wonder Furina was so excited when Traveler and was so eager to start a trial with her. She was looking forward to that “exciting trial” and was trying to find a way to put Traveler on trial  My god the story behind Fontaine is insanely good, I even cried when Focalors said “Thank you, Furina for all you’ve done. From this moment on. Please live happily as a human. Just as I wish we could” and then Neuvilette soaring to the sky where you can see his intense emotions through the weather. I applaud you guys for such an amazing story. Compared to any other Archon Quest, I really ended up reading every word. It was just THAT good of a story.  The English VA for Furina did such a splendid job, she really was able to make me feel the characters emotions so easily. And the dialogue was just too good to skim through. Maybe that’s why I started crying after watching Furina’s flashbacks for her 500 years of suffering, I stg if Nathan finds a way to make me attached to another character again 😂   Thank you for a wonderful chapter. I can’t wait for Natlan and the rest :))
Am i the only one that feels a little nostalgic seeing this? It happened only 3 months ago,but act 1 and act 2 feel so..... Distant,to me.
Now that we know everything Fontaine was truthly the best national of all. Thank you so much for all this Magic Show!! 🥹💙
Lynette's little "Ta-da~" is so cute.
After all what happened in 4.2, I can finally say Genshin is at its peak rn
Guys, who know the music?
"I, Focalors, hereby welcome you to the nation of Hydro~ And acknowledge the value and significance of this trip. Now, you may rejoice in this!" why is this my favorite line from Furina..😭✊
This hits hard after the final archon quest
After 4.2 archon quest, the first line really hits hard....
0:20 she presents herself as "Focalors" but i the game she said "Furina"
попец
She really is weeping on her throne now..
i cant believe how much Hoyoverse baboozeled us with that Trailer...
Furina 🔥
3:47 chills every time. the music, the voice acting, everything is so perfect
fontaine 😭😭😭
Fontaine gives me major altissia vibes from ffxv and I love that
Aether in this trailer: 🧍🏻
Furina sounds like shes advertising fontaine 😭
The Fontaine trailer and Childe's entrance looked so cool, man this update is gonna be one heck of a splash.
Now since Fontaine now exist, i may now die peacefully
Furina is too beautiful.....My heart is for her...
Lynette giving keqing vibes❤
i love how you can see the people putting up posters from 49-54
in fontaine neuvillette don't have to do something to childe buz childe have a brother his brother will heatbroke for that😮
DOTTORE ON BALLON I REAPT DOTTORE ON BALLON 0:32
After watching 4.1 trailer!
pliss hoyo rate onn hu taoo((
Is Tartaglia part of the problem of Fontaine?
Love it!
А скок она стоит?
Верно ли суждение : Макросы в Genshin Impact можно использовать для выполнения рутинных операций, таких как сбор ресурсов, открытие сундуков и выполнение повторяющихся заданий, но их использование в сражениях или в ПвП-режиме строго запрещено. Подобные запреты введены для того, чтобы обеспечить равные условия для всех игроков, и предотвратить возможность создания автоматических макросов, которые обесценивают навыки и умения других игроков.  или макросы полностью запрещены ?
I WANT TO PLAY IT BUT MY STORAGE IS GONNA HATE ME
This one archon quest was so short that it was boring
Crack theory, 2:50 that voice will end up being childe and the later part of the archon quest or perhaps his second story quest is figuring out how to un-dissolve him
I...I just heard is..why....to...up-...updeat 4..4.0??
Lyney & Focalor's va completely nailed their character roles hands down!
❤
Song? Music? Please!
Bruh i did well by not watching this trailer before, there's literally no fun in playing the quests had I seen this before
Hi
4:20 wait is that childe?
Please add Arabic language to the game
A nation about false justice, oh am I hyped for this…
tf is childe doing here
Nuevillete and the Hydro Archon will be in my account.(Hopefully if I will the 50/50s)
On behalf on the Genshin Community, I would like to thank Mihoyo for giving us lots of water to take a bath in this version 4.0
Remember Traveler no matter where you go Mondstat is always home . ❤
Looks cool but I don't feel doing 2 hour skip dialogue quests, more finding the new turrets n amollucous, and after doing all that the game has no end game so no reason to play it
There are theories around childe dying in Fontaine or just dying in the future…..if it’s true half of the genshin fans will quit! Please don’t make him die…
I like genshin impact pack that I play it every day thank you very much for creating the game❤
Bro the music is op
Freminet’s ost hit hard here and in his demo. I’m definitely pulling for that the baby boi, he’s coming home with his siblings. And maybe C1 Zhongli
4:30 idk why but that melody sounds familiar if anyone knows something please let me know.
This is amazing🤭🤭🤭
my genshin won't load🥲
Make kid boy charaecter for the universe balance
0:10 How Furina will look in atop the character menu, just minus the crying. Well Hopefully..
That ferment music transitions was fire
3/ -
I really thought Neuvillette was gonna be some evil old man but he proved me wrong and now I love him too much
No, it’s talking about what number is a were at the end 5:55 for the fifth nation
Bro, why are you talking about global warming bro?
4:05 Does anyone know the name of this ost?
Looks more French than France today
I wish I could download the latest up date but it’s too chunky for my I pad
The quality of archon quest is raising with every version.
need more of 2:09
Don't play Genshin, follow it for the music. To me, this song feels like the good guys, overconfident or mischievious, eventually lost their battle in the end. The short burst at the last ten seconds or so makes it feel like it was their last push. There is always a theme to this game's music, it always hits you with a loud, confident, or dramatic section than shifts into a solemn, melancholy feel.  The mix of orchestra, opera, electric instruments, acoustic guitar, edm and so on always catches me off guard! (ignoring character voices.) 0:55 This brass gives a hidden sadness vibe 2:55 The organ which symbolizes holiness makes me feel like there is something immensely dangerous in either one big destructive entity or some overseeing oppressive force. 3:35 The intense percussion and the choir shows that there is some looming entity suppressing this region. Also sounds like an intense movie trailer. 4:05 Soloist opera singer reminds me of La Signora's battle theme, but instead of tragic, it sounds dramatic for the trailer. 4:20 Love the series of pauses, it adds suspense but also acts as a reset. A palate cleanser if you will. 4:28 Like that off sounding key. Minor? Flat? Idk. 4:32 Where did this electric guitar come from? It sounds like one last push to victory. Very unsatisfactory or unusual ending to the ear. Leaves the listener feeling down, anxious, or uncomfortable. But it ends with a lower note compared to the higher music before it, which to me signifies resolve. So it sounds like the good guys loosing.  Genshin's music composers and producers are back again to produce top notch and striking pieces of art!
Archonnya wangy❤️
Fontaine!

Huh, such a interesting Arc, i wonder how it will end?
👆
Imagine the day when with video gets 4M views kinda like 4.0 in genshin rn
Because Tartaglia appears in Fontaine... what did he come to do... What does he want... surely, Tartaglia wants something bad... And with some problems surely... 😞😞😞(⁠◠⁠‿⁠◕⁠)..
Man i wonder when we see the archon quest titled masquerade of the guilty
London has visibly worsened. Archons help us.
0:13 it hurts me to see Furina crying
Sometimes I like to dub these kind of trailers like:  As light Rain Falls Without Reason, Genshin Impact 4.0, Act 4, Fontaine
4.0 Archon Quests is really good. Especially solving the disappearance case, I've always wanted to experience solving a case in a game. I kinda want to see a story quest for Navia, if she's a 5 star though. I wanna know more about her story, her life/history seems very interesting.
1:02 Origami tutorials be like:
Genshin, please make the hydro archon a good archon and really powerful seen cut in act 3 like raiden in act 2 try to kill the trav
8
BOOO I CANT EVEN LOG IN
Childe Transformation Gacha when?
that last line of child, got me chills
Childe coming in after a long time in fontaine  makes this epic....he is best & will be the best dude..🔥🔥 HIS ENTRANCE ALWAYS GIVES CHILLS...it was unexpected! Seeing him here literally made me so happy & excited oh yeah here we go!
Lel
I’ve watched this sooo many times, I’ve watched content creators react to it, played through the archon quest I and II, watched people play through it. And everytime i see Childe and that scene at the end I’m like “Griffin Burns you did it again. That was so good!”
شايلد يا لبيييييه 😩🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is lynette good?
Childe will come home in 12 days
I like how the most replayed moment went from Mr. Worldwide to Clorinde
This music goes hard
THATS MY GIRLIEEE
And love anime’s especially this one
I have that game!
Is it just me, or did Vacher’s story resembled that of Booker DeWitt’s?
good lord the transition to freminet's theme really makes me feel like ive been dumped into the cold deep sea
好好好
Words cannot explain how extremely exquisite the two magicians and the region is!!!
Fontaine being the only landlocked region while being associated with Hydro:
Wait what this came out on my birthday….. HELL YA 🎉
Dottore where
Fontaine has the best story so far.
1.06 Fatui Font
I wonder if we see signora in fotnaine

❤❤ fav nation
I can feel the justice coming inside me‼️‼️‼️‼️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
tartaglia never fails to make his mark
God I love how hard this trailer lies to us.
So glad I didn’t watch this trailer prior as going into this blind was so fun.
Just completed first part of the Archon quest, took a break to take it aaalll in. Everything that I have witnessed. I swear to god I have never played a game that leaves me so fulfilled it's way of storytelling, character sketches and world lore. Genshin Impact has given me more value playtime despite being a free game as compared to some abhorrently made PAID Western games with zero substance and only non sensical pandering.  Hoyoverse is the real G.O.A.T man!!! Keep up the great job!❤
Дайте...Лини !!! Я задолбала сб крутить уже , дохера крутила , дайте
2:50 The bitter memories of the archon
TARTAGLIA?! AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I wonder what 4.1 archon quest will be
Fontaine is my fav area so far. I hope its not like sumeru where they only focus on the one area. But expand on older ones too like dorman port or liyue
Hello Mr. WORLDWIDE, OFC childe is there to make a show. ❤
epic
PLS HOYOVERSE ADD AN CONTROLLER SUPPORT FOR ANDROID USERS.
“Metal clanking sounds of two steel faces colliding” —Coppelius and Coppelia probably
She sounds like fishcl for me💀
Bro ! That's fantastic
Having gone back to watch past trailers im kind of surprised by how lighthearted the vibes are between the shots of Focalors weeping on the throne in the sunken Fontaine. Like, were outright told at the start that the whole country is in serious danger but the grandeur of Fontaine being shown off didnt feel heavy like it did in, say, the Sumeru trailer where even shots of buildings was paired with emphatic parts of the music that made it feel intense, if that makes sense. Fontaines trailer starts so serious then seems to be trying to get us invested in the country in a fun enjoyable way before dropping the intense story heavy consequences of how this is all going to play out on us much more suddenly Its kind of interesting that theyre coming at this from a different angle than usual
After playing trough the Archon quest, I feel like this trailer was just one massive bait.
My fab reigon so far
I can’t seem to get in the new hydro i play on the ps5 and I have to log in for something to get new hydro nation I’m still jumping up and down of excitement today
Hi not to be rude but STOP GIVING ME GENSHIN ADDS Ty bye
0:21 I, Focalor, Hereby Welcome U To The Nation of hYdroooough~
Childe wasn't wearing his vision...
I just starting playing this game, and its totally amazing
HE GOT HIS OWN RULES
Fue una pasada la actualizacion, sin duda para mi es la mejor nacion
Cant believe all that fits in just 2 quests :O
Fontaine was amazing
i like how "misleading" this trailer somehow. the archon quest was so full of twist
This game is ahhhh
When ibrahim kill the lava slimes on the seven go ameo they just keep respawning and if ibrahim try to leave then it takes me back
Give me neuvillette pls
2:57 song?
I invested 90 pulls and go worst possible 5 star character qiqi and also worst case is I got barbara upto c6 in all my 10 star pulls and lynette and two identical swords for which I don't have any suitable character, will my pulls be carry forwarded so that I can get decent 5 star character.
I want to say that this is the most interesting and best update in a long time!!
IM IN LOVE IM IN LOVE IM IN LOVE i swear fontaine always has to be extra in a good way🤞🏼love everything about it
I'm suspecting Sandrone will be here too.. Indicating the robots have a similar attire to her ruin guard..
Hey, guys? There's no oxygen bar. How do you drown when swimming with your head above water exactly? If you're tired, just rest at the bottom of the ocean until you're well rested. That said, this trailer is absolutely perfect. It's so epic and I can't wait to get to Fontaine soon.
Ураааа у геншин импакт выходят видео
i really love NAVIA!!!!!
Rather low to not only copy the aesthetic of Bioshock, but the ending too? pls be better
Genshin is Focalor gonna have a Banner?
wait where is that cottage located
Amazing update omg
ХАРОООШ
My phone is gonna explode
pv and actual story are totally different
"Hoyoverse give me Aquaman power"
1:24 tada~
Man, look at Genshin finally getting underwater what… 4 years in? They gotta stop copying other games!
What does it cost to put a simple button to skip the game's dialogues? we can no longer stand endlessly pressing the mouse click or keyboard space.
2:59 the drop and the music HITS
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
the version is finally released and love how they making me believe that clorinde is about to fight navia during the scene where navia surrounded by the Meka. what a plot twist.
После прохождения квеста так и хочется сказать, какие же мастера хойоверсы вырывать фрагменты из контекста)
❤❤❤
Вау
Im finished after 2 days with full fontaine....now no content kekw Loved every second of it <3
Omg already better than inazuma-
The way they entrapped us to be so excited about this is amazing
Okey. I take back my word month ago, now that i see revilette character is what i want all this time in genshin. A male mage catalyst. You are my favorite game again. 😊
CHILDEEEEE
1:50 where is this I can’t find it😭
Looking interesting 🤔 should I play it!?
Isso tá simplesmente INCRÍVEL 🎉🇧🇷
I love when childe comes in and his music plays, hoyoverse knows what he's doing 🥰❤️
“As a light rain falls without reason” <3
NO WAY ED SHEERAN!!!!
is there gonna b an ace attorney gamemode lolzies
I'm all video: WOW I LOVE FONTAINE😍 I'm in end: CHILDE?!?!😳🤯
Oh my goodness Chipset return ? And i love this archon😊
"Let them eat cake" - Furina, Hydro Achron probably
this cat girl is so smash omg
2:57 the way the music shifts, I love this part it makes it so much better ❤
I’m sorry I want to know what happened to Lynette in that water cage thing I’m concerned….
Still no switch 😢
I LOVE THIS  ITS LIKE A MOVIE TRAILER ISSJSHDBSVSV
Hoyo, please continue the tradition of us being saved by an anemo character. This time, by Heizou 🧐
Happy Travel to Fontaine <3
I really do hate childe but he's got style and I really want him to be on the good side and leave the fatui but actually I think that if he saved fontaine that's to take the hydro archon's gnosis
So far we seen Childe Archelino But yet set to see the actual person that fits the theme Sandrone
Genshin still bad. I’m flat I quit it after anazuma arc
I like focalar not foselar
this game is very poorly optimized, this version 4.0 is a 61GB update on PS4 and 10GB on mobile and it's not even the final size of this new part of the game. AC Odyssey is huge and has 80GB. It's time to hire people specialized in game optimization because it's ridiculous this way.
Everyone says omg childe in the story im so excited which is true but someone said that they don't care what about lynette did she die my friend said she had a death scene
Well... We're going to have some trouble in Fontaine, So we might as well put on a good show. God, What an amazing Trailer.  Every part of it is amazing!
Я ЛЮБЛЮ ТАРТАЛЬЮ
They trolled us w the chamber falling thing. So many speculated that lynette was boutta die at 3:38. Rip cowell tho
no puedo explicar lo mucho que me excite.❤
we finally have a male eula
Future Focalor haver yes
I'M COMPLETELY ADDICTED TO THIS GAME, IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT!!! THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS!
Fontain looks like it was built by Kirin Jindosh. I can feel Dishonored 2 vibe, only more colorful
Unlike the 3 Nation before fontaine, now it's archon who govern it welcome us directly, which in previous nation, we must seek audience / find them secretly / uncover the truth 😂
SERVERS OPEN!!!  BEST OF LUCK TO YOU ALL!!!
Man,I want a New Childe character,one that's a bit more lore accurate.With delusional ability and abyssal transformation   Like that imbitor lunae from Star rail
Childe, Mr worldwide indeed
Hmmm.... looks very "Tower of fantasy" like.... This part of the game.
thing im most excited for is childe coming back into this story ahhhh
Not me waiting for Childe to say “I wasn’t expecting you here”
Bro is Fontaine is based on France then this must be the French Revolution
Just a few hours left, hope everyone have a fantastic time in Fontaine and may you all win your 50/50s <3
WTFFFF IM SO EXITED FONTAINE IS OUT NOW AND IM ABOUT TO GO PLAYY
2:09
watching it again cause Fontaine is only 3 and a half hours away and i can't wait
I LOVE IT SO MUCH!💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
THIS IS SO MOVIE LIKE! 1:04 - 2:45
Praying paimon shut up and the travel speaks in 4.0
funny how fountain is now facing climate changes too cuz of their machines 💀
mid as hell
**Ready for the next calamity!!**
Lyney kinda reminds me of Diona😭 with the cat thingy
01:23
FONTAINE IS COMING AND SO AM I
my storage died but let's go fontaine
Vive La France
Эх. Жалко конечно что Архонт Справедливости не блонда. Как бы я кекал с этих джастин
Жду братьев и сестричку! Очень хочется их увидеть!
Момент с Тартальей  - в самое сердце! Так динамично и мощно! Обожаю этого персонажа!  Очень жду!
The prophecy mentioned at the beginning makes me think Fontaine is going to become the Atlantis of Genshin Impact. Now, I don't play this game, but I know this is implying that Fontaine is gonna sink like Atlantis.
3:57 they finally added sunglasses in the game lol
God i'm so happy that foutaine is coming out
Whenever I hear “is this part of the show?” All I can hear is Minnie Mouse’s voice.
Fellow Childe mains eating well on the new archon quest
2:27 the exact reason why I wanna go scuba diving. The ocean is so beautiful and amazing and whenever I’m in a pool, I wear my snorkel mask and I like to make myself sink. While I’m at the bottom of the pool, I like to look up at the sky. Being underwater feels so different but being underwater in the ocean feels like a whole other world.
after a lot of months without genshin, i think i'm going back in 4.0
Meu amigo……… 😮
Bro 😂 Ace attorney update 🎉
I thougjt it qas fischl!! So theatrical
at 2:53 it looks like we get to meet the current Oceanid
Guess the eras tour is taking another stop in ✨france✨
I, FOCALORS, HEREBY WELCOME YOU TO THE NATION OF HYDRO
So does Childe save/intervene in our trial? I'm getting Liyue flashbacks lol
Imagine how insane the rest will be when fontaine is this amazing already
DAWG THERES MORE????
DAMNNNNNN OMGGG
time to claim another god
Okay I have a theory. Just humor me here, take it with a grain of salt (but please don't be rude). For me, characters with hydro visions are those that exhibit DUALITY and adaptability to go with the flow (like Childe, Ayato, Yelan and Kokomi), hence the versatility it provides in most team comps. Needless to say, hydro is one of the strongest elements. On the other hand, the hydro abyss mages show us one extreme case of how hydro can literally imprison characters. And, if not applied with the correct strategy, it is very difficult to deal with hydro bosses. You could be level 90 but good luck trying to kill Rhodeia with a full hydro non-physical team. Those hydro mimics deal insane damage. You might not stagger fighting them but before you know it, you're already at 1hp. Heck, Rhodeia even heals them if you don't kill them fast enough. All this tells how hydro as an element has two sides to it: the healing one and the extremely painful one. Similar to Anemo, Hydro "goes with the flow" but unlike Anemo that literally says "idgaf", Hydro is grounded in reality. Hydro possessors literally "go with the flow" whether it's the good or the bad side to fulfill a goal that they are deadset on. Now what does that remind us of? POLITICS. Exactly. The concept that has been publicized about Fontaine and its archon so far is that their courtroom is a "theatre" of sorts. This is like that age old adage: "POLITICS IS A FARCE" Here, there is no real "justice" and there is no real right or wrong. The thing is, "justice" is apparently the wish and desire of the people of Fontaine. And we all know that Archons are only given power based on their respective people's faith. It will not be far off to see that the current hydro archon has been driven mad (as in mentally unstable) with the "justice" that her people desperately wish for because their "justice" mean different things depending on which faction you ask, but in general, it results in the fall of their enemies--and if their enemies are fellow believers, well obviously it gets confusing. It's like there's always 2 sides to a coin but if it's like that, then how can you judge who is right and who is wrong? A huge indicator of this duality factor is the different eyes and face decals the hydro archon has on either side: one is weeping while the other has a star. Basically saying yes, the hydro archon has been driven mad by the demands of her people for their own respective "justices". She can just annihilate whoever she doesn't like but in the name of "justice", she cannot. Her power over "justice" ironically has made her prisoner. The thing is, while water flows gently in a peaceful spring, it is relentless in the torrential rapids and an absolute hell in the storm. Rain never discriminates. "Light rain falls without reason." If pushed to the edge, she can just deliver her own "justice" to the hypocrites who have been using her (the divide among citizens no doubt instigated by the Fatui). The hydro archon probably knows how dangerously close she is to exploding and drowning everyone in her madness so her last remaining sanity is seeking for help. Or the more likely one is that, going further along the DUALITY concept, being the hydro archon of a land where there's literally water everywhere, she probably already knows what is going on behind the scenes and is acting The Fool (won't be hard, she's already crazy), going along with the flow to keep her citizens from becoming hostages until comes a time where she can find a decent helper to put her plans in motion and wreak havoc without harming her people. And I guess that's where the traveller enters the scene and sorts out all the wrinkles.
rip my pc storage 😀✌
слишком эпично,слишком красиво
This is going to be amazing! I already know it! 😊
WHAT HE DO IN FONTAINE
it’s here
4:19 Kamen Rider Tartaglia swoops in.
Tada~
Lezzzzzgggoooo!!!!!! I moved stuff around my PC just so I can make space for this update ❤😅
I mean...no hype at all...
Monetary 2
Quick ranmbling session      IM SO EXCITED! THEY ALL LOOK SO PRETTY! IM FRENCH SO IM EXCITED AS HELL! I CANT EXPRESS HOW MUCH I WILL FANGIRL OVER FONTAINE
looks mid
❤
Man i wanna c6 Lynette
I stopped playing when 3.0 dropped but damn is this tempting me to come back lol.
I'm so excited that I can't even sleep now! The only bad thing about this Update is the size of the Update ehehe... I installed a second SSD just for Genshin Impact and moved it over...  Fans: How big do you wanna become? Genshin Impact: ...
Industrial concept
Can't wait to learn what the problem is in Fontain and how its the Fatui's fault.
Unfortunately, these are the last days of my game of genshin, I personally won’t be able to run around Fontaine, although I would really like to, apparently out of luck, the last 9+ GB just don’t fit into the phone, and this is not the last card, at such a pace they will reach the final game only PC players, and even then not all, go into depression....ಥ⁠_⁠ಥ
Man this is fire. cant wait for this the best utp of ever im all ready in love whit thisi cant wait to pull for somewonn in this utp
When is this version supposed to be here?
Hyped
Can’t believe it’s tomorrow
Why is fontaine a lot more advanced than mond or any other region in that regards
Documenting that I was here for this.. but also I want to play just for Neuvillette
Tommorow is the day🔥🔥
Who know theme music on 2.18?
WOW
time to fight another fatui and/or god fun I CANT WAIT TO BE WANTED IN 5 NATIONS WOOO
umm helo , how the story will progress , it's mess now lol and i'm hella confused wth
I can’t believe I didn’t see Neuvillette’s pointed ears
3:47 is such a vibe lol
1:53 Huh... did Albedo draw something again?
4:23 🔥🔥🔥
CHILDE IN FONTAINE?
Damn you, Tartaglia. This is supposed to be my moment, not yours.
The hydro archon looks like grown up qiqi
I wish child brought Klee to make this even more hype
If I have a nickel that an Electro woman leading an army comes to arrest or capture the Traveler and is being helped by a Geo User, I will have two nickels, which isn't alot but its strange it happens twice
CHILDE????? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
I played Genshin for a long time now, more than two years. Though, there might been some things I didn't like that much I still really loved this game. As time passed my computer couldn't handle grafic, and I made it as low as it was possible so I could play. And now when I was so happy to see that Fontaine is already here my computer can't handle this game anymore, I have no more free space and I have nothing to delete. It's been a long way, I was truly glad to play Genshin Impact. Goodbye
HIII I JUST STARTED GENSHIN :33
И та самая фраза Венти: Бонджур (е)энд фокен эр(н)!
Kafka video has more views already, the rain starts to fall over Genshin nowadays 🌧
Entire time I was like 😮😮😮 THIS IS THE FINALE YOOH ANOTHER ARCHON WAR 🔥🔥🔥
Just another place I become a fugitive then save the country
The previous Hydro archon is in Fontaine, hopefully she gives us a good lore dump
Aether looks so sad
Idc what anybody says about genshin its pretty good tbh
Lynette is so cute and pretty.😳
I'm happy to see Childe, but would he fight with us? Maybe it's the Fatui who makes the sister disappear
Lynette's Tada IS SO CUTE.
Just asking but... the pipe is a SWORD ?!!!
Кажется,Фонтейн будет одной из моих наилюбимийших регионов и локаций впринципе❤
ТАРТАРЛЬЯ???!!!????
4:00 traveler is hurt
Another female archon. This means that so far Zhongli and Drunk effeminate anemo are the only male archons in this franchise
touch grass
The dancing mechanical bots were probably one of my favorite parts! ❤
im skiping them all those randoms just to pull for mommy arlecchino🗣️🫴🍒
I’ve been watching this trailer so much, I love it  I find it hilarious how pretty much everyone is bashing Focalors at the end  Edit: I was wrong, They were actually bashing Neuvillette
eek!!
Is Focalors VA Constance from Fire Emblem? She sounds pretty similar
lynette theme stole from super mario !!!!!! ths is literlly catr mario from 3d world on wii u, wuta rip off skull eoji
lynnete theme literally blatant copy of super mario 3d world cat theme what a rip off 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Tartaglia my boy 🤩😍 I'm really hyped about Fontain, can't wait
Where TF is Wriothesley?
TARTAGLIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA MEOWWWW
4:02 INSTANT CHILLS  " I believe this is indeed the "finale" " coupled with the other dialogues addressing Fontaine's issues, the fight scene, Childe making an appearance while the music becomes more and more intense is so overwhelming in the best of ways NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WATCH THE TRAILER
Viva la Revolution?
xfa que tarta este de nuestro lado
АААААА СПАСИБО ВАМММММ МНЕ ОЧЕНЬ НРАВИТСЯ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
RAIDEN SHOGUN RERUN WHEN???

I'm not ready for fonataine yet😢
Yall pls attend my phone funeral when i try to update my Genshin😢
Get me off the screen, I'm jealous because I can't afford to play💔
Fontaine I can't wait to explore as well as God and I'm just as curious as to what it will look like. I can't wait for the Pyro area as well, but it will probably be next year, but it will still be an interesting trip to visit it, I feel like diving after. :))
Just started playing again and was addicted ar 19, 2 days in
Ow... Wow... We can go under the sea? 😍😍😍
I WIGGLED MY TOES AND MY JAW *DROPPED* WHEN CHILDE RETURNED.
yay tartaglia showed up :D
Господи верни мне мой геншин прошу, ибо это уже даже не 6+, это уже 0 - ...
Pretty sure got goosepumps when childe came into the screen
Am I the only one who is realizing they put Finale in Quotation marks?   ' This is indeed the "finale" '  Like Focalors said this what could she mean?
Garbage discord mod game
Brah child what are doing here 😂😂 4:19
4:27 Childe did you woke up another ancient god who just happens to be relate to hydro?
The music change at 1:43 is just *chefs kiss* AMAZIN'. I can't wait to explore just to listen to the music.
Man its in 4 days
Mr world wide is back

The way she says hydro>>>
GOD FREMINET 😍😍😍😍😍😍🏳️‍🌈😍😍🏳️‍🌈😍🏳️‍🌈😍🏳️‍🌈😍
THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING TO ADVENTURE FONTAINE!!!!!
TAYLOR SWIFT??
k u r o
What is the music startimg at 4:05
I NEED LYNETTE
Why is my boy Tartaglia in Fontaine- 😨
My storage 📈
Childe joining the good side now?!??
Genshin impact never caught my attention, but now that I see it I want to play it... And the worst thing is that my cell phone doesn't work 😢
I want c6 lynette so bad
😊❤🎉
❤❤❤
Man i love twinks😊
I cannot tell what Freminet's gender is and I honestly don't really need to know. Their design is almost too awesome for me to care.      FINE, yes, Childe was cool. Okay, maybe he was really cool. *adds 2 points to Childe appreciation counter*
I actually squealed when I saw childe
FREMINET I LOVE YA
YAYYYYYYYYY CHILDE
I LOVE LYNEY DESIGN  AND VIBES
Childe, understand, I love you so much aaaaaa
pqp
Wow Fontaine is beautiful! I've never liked Focalors, but I'm really excited for Fontaines quest, characters and lore!!
Focalore: The queen of sassiness
I love the way Fontaine looks!! Tho I’m a little sad it’s based on France. As someone from the Netherlands, I’d love to have seen Fontaine based on the Netherlands since we have a LOT of water- still super excited for the new region!! It all looks AMAZING
So disappointed by this. It all looks so underwhelming and the magic show stuff just looks stupid (and the first 3 new characters that all look so samey and unispired too). I thought Fontaine was going to be a late eighteen hundreds London type of town, industrial revolution style. Its the way they always describe it with technology and inventions being at the front. That big building in the trailer just looks like another Akademiya or something.  And easiest trounce domain weakling Childe does worse to boost any hopes lol. When is he going to get a redemption story for nearly wiping Liyue off the map, including the fact his own little brother happened to be in the area too??? Whoops Childe, I guess it was okay to nearly genocide all the children in Liyue BEFORE you realised your brat nusiance of a brother was there too. But nah, lets all completely ignore that THAT actually happened in canon. "Childe is so cool" lol.
when will there be a banner on Itto?
Mafia, Svarog from Honkai: Star Rail & a Waterfall that can be seen in Lake Gala in Trails of Cold Steel 4?
I love the underwater swimming
Woah I’m speechless… we get to see childe as well 😭
The way this is based off of france makes it even better. Plus i love the ocean, too!
Love how neuvillette looks so annoyed w childe lol
CHILDE
Ngl freminet reminds me of Xingqiu with a claymore and a cryo vision
I want to play this world, too. But not for 2.0 to 3.9😢😢😢
save for Childe i cant let him go
0:59 2:03
Это чудесно
Varka where mihoyo 🤡
Hype. but also, Switch release date???
Tada~
Nobody is talking about freminet s entrance and music so good yo
Ahh time to collect all the oculi’s again💀
Fontaine giving Alice in wonderland and clock work...plus black butler for some reason. Love it ❤
Being a childe girl....am just so happy to see him
Let's gooo!!
icant wait till the update yelan is gonna be my new 5 star 100%
Hola equipo de Genshin Impact. Quiero comunicarles mis inquietudes sobre Dehya y el trato que los desarrolladores de Genshin Impact le han dado hasta el día de la fecha. Han pasado ya poco más de 5 meses desde la salida de Dehya un personaje que gran parte de la comunidad estaba esperando y las quejas sobre el desempeño de ella en el juego en comparación con otros personajes incluso 4 estrellas (xiangling, xinqiu, fischl, etc) se hicieron notar en redes sociales y correos al soporte y aun con todo eso y el tiempo que llevamos no se han comunicado por ningún medio oficial sobre el asunto caso contrario como lo fue con Zhongli, ya que hubo un intercambio de información en un comunicado oficial y un CAMBIO a cómo funciona el personaje al cabo de unas versiones. Aun así es demasiado tiempo como para que ni siquiera anuncien que están viendo la situación con el equipo de desarrollo a través de Twitter con un anuncio teniendo en cuenta que en los correos del soporte técnico nos dicen que les envían el feedback a ustedes los desarrolladores.  Es decepcionante y se podría llegar a entender que es deliberado el mal desempeño del personaje para ver qué tanto dinero pueden sacar de este experimento. No encuentro justificación para ponerla en el banner estándar teniendo a un personaje 5 estrellas de Sumeru y a un personaje de mandoble pyro ahí. No recomendaría a nadie el juego, no solo por el trato que le dieron al personaje sino también por el silencio de la compañía y la censura en redes sociales como el reddit oficial de genshin impact. Y más aún que mucho del feedback puesto a su disposición sobre el kit de Dehya esta visto en el personaje FU XUAN de Honkai Star Rail, me parece una burla a nosotros como jugadores del juego. Les dejo una lista detallada de sus problemas y como podrían solucionarlos de un usuario de la comunidad de GI: Issues: 1.	The Fiery Sanctum field, her main ability, and Gold-Forged Form (passive) is not available all the time. 2.	She cannot reliably keep other on-field characters alive because there is a 8 second downtime on Fiery Sanctum, and a 9 second downtime for Gold-Forged Form. At this point, it would be much better to choose shielding units like Noelle, Thoma and Layla, or choose healers like Barbara and Bennett. 3.	She does not apply pyro consistently. 4.	Her damage is very underwhelming, especially with an elemental burst that is only used for dealing damage. Moreover, her elemental burst does not trigger Xingqiu's Rain Swords or Yelan's Depth Clarion Dice. 5.	The player loses control during Leonine Bite. Even jumping, something that is essential when frozen or locked inside a bubble, cancels the remaining duration of the burst. 6.	Her constellations mostly only serve to increase her underwhelming damage, and do very little to improve her gameplay. Please consider the following improvements for Dehya: 1.	Raging Flame, as well as Incineration Drive, should reset the duration of Fiery Sanctum. This can ensure consistent uptime of her main purpose: damage mitigation/transfer. Furthermore, the damage mitigation granted by Fiery Sanctum should be higher. Having the protected character take damage defeats the purpose of a bodyguard. 2.	Gold-Forged Form state granted by her passive Unstinting Succor should last as long as there is an existing Fiery Sanctum. This further improves Dehya's bodyguard utility by keeping the on-field character upright and able to do damage by increasing the duration of resistance to interruption. 3.	The coordinated attack from Fiery Sanctum should occur at intervals much shorter than 2.5 seconds, and should apply pyro with every attack. This improves Dehya's utility as an off-field support/DPS. 4.	There should at least be a mechanic to increase Leonine Bite's damage based on the damage taken by Dehya. Or have Roaring Barrage trigger Xingqiu's Rain Swords or Yelan's Depth Clarion Dice. This would give Leonine Bite the damage fitting of such awesome animations. 5.	Even better, remove the auto-attack of Leonine Bite. Give control of the character to the player. Instead, have Dehya enter a different state and grant her increased attack speed. I have wanted to play Dehya since her reveal in the 3.0 trailer. To finally get her but not have a comfortable time playing her due to her many issues is incredibly disheartening. It pains me and many other players to see the character that we have waited for so long be so underwhelming. I, along with many other players, hope to see much-needed improvements in Dehya's gameplay in the near future. We hope that we get to fully enjoy one of our favorite characters to the fullest of her potential. Sincerely, A Dehya Haver and Genshin Impact Enjoyer. - Realmente espero que tomen en consideración nuestro feedback y hagan algo al respecto por respeto a sus jugadores.  Otros cambios que me gustaría ver en el juego serian: - El de que se quite el signo de exclamación de las constelaciones de los personajes una vez que el jugador entro en ese apartado. - Que haya un cambio en el sistema de artefactos pudiendo elegir que set y partes de artefactos se desea farmear a la vez que se implemente con alguna mecánica el obtener stats y substats deseados por el jugador. Cosa qye ya esta semi implementada en Honka Star Rail siendo que Genshin Impact lleva más tiempo en el mercado y recibiendo este feedback por más tiempo. - La capacidad de los artefactos en la mochila que sea incrementada. - Poder guardar conjuntos de artefactos para cambiarlos de una manera más cómoda. - Que se incremente la cantidad de resina concentrada de 5 a 7. - Que se aumente la cantidad de resina original a 220 y que el tiempo de regeneración de la dicha sea reducido. - Poder saltarse diálogos enteros de las misiones diarias. - Que las brújulas buscatesoros marquen en un rango mas amplio los cofres y muestren un icono como lo hace el artilugio en el evento de la 3.8 “Espejismo Veluriyam”, podría ser a través de una mejora de las dichas. - Que se pueda sincronizar los cofres, cualquier tipo de recompensas ya obtenidos en el juego con Teyvat  Interactive map.  Me gusta el juego, su historia, ambientación, música y creatividad en las mecánicas pero lo que paso con Dehya me parece gravísimo, por el silencio que tienen frente a este problema, la censura y la poca interacción que tienen los desarrolladores con sus jugadores.
Yk they could just be coding this and recording this and once there done rec then they delete it😮
Diooooos qué increíble todo!!!! Y ni hablar de Childe [screaming un perra loca]
1:24 tada moment
cant wait for the lore this is gonna be absolutely fire 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
АААААА ЧАЙЛДЕ ТЫ ЧТО ТАМ ДЕЛАЕШЬ ОАОАОА ОМГ МНЕ ПЛОХО
GENSHIN DO THE UPDATE NOW AM SO EXCITED
Fontaines gonna be CRAZY i just know it‼️‼️🙏
So... Genshin Impact: The Ace Attorney Chapter.  Got it.
It's true that a lot of Fontaine is based on France, but this week I was visiting Venice and immediately reminded me of Fontaine and how the city is flooding little by little and in the future is probably going to become an underwater museum with all its beautiful architecture.  Also the location of Fontaine in the map makes it feel like it's the Mediterranean Sea.
Focalors is so material girl somehow lol
The fact that freminet has the bell probably to reference diving bells…
FONTAINE HYPE! I still haven't done the Sumereu (how to spell?) Quest though....c
Фокалор > Все остальное в этом трейлере🥰🥰🥰
FOCALORS INTRO IS SO GOOD
Im very Hyped of This Series but before i play the Quest Exploring comes Fisrt as much i can and how the Quest hits the Sumeru Quest hit me very hard and Childe best Bbboooyyy👍🏻
My typa trailer fr this update is gonna be a banger
im excited! i love opera (im a complete beginner in singing it though) and marine life, it seems like the perfect nation to me.
АЛАОАОАОАО ЛУЧШИЙ ТРЕЙЛЕР😨
who made the captions???
Yo not many of us realised but clorinde was literally fighting the gardes so maybe she is on the travelers side 4:15
I'M HAPPY TO SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO APPRECIATE CHILDE AS I DO. LITERALLY SCREAMED WHEN I SAW HIM THIS IS BOUND TO BE EPIC
I don't why, but I get tatsumaki vibes from hydro archon...
Круто
childeeeeeeeee he's baaaaaaaaaaack yeeessssssssss
Wow I got this as an add and watched the whole thing this is so good
Youre so called justice, your beloved drama....
Y’all help, what happened to 3.9???
2:09 eula vibes with that guitar~so good,  scratches my brain in all the right places..
mau main tapi storage ga cukup... 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
这是非常美丽的，我很高兴与我最喜欢的魔术师和Tartaglia！!! :0
bro yelan is the hydro archon
People might not like Childe at all, but no one can deny that he has style
LYNETTE'S TADA 💗
my draw DROPPED when i saw tartaglia omg! took a very long break after sumeru came out but definitely coming back wowowowowowowow <3
Hoyoverse sure knows how to generate the hype 😍
CHAT IS THIS REAL
I love everyone's voices, I gotta hear their Chinese voices now. All the voices are exactly how I imagined them in my mind. The siblings playstyle looks fun too. I'm definitely gonna aim for all three of them! Is Furina the real issue here like with Shogun? And Tartaglia being that way makes sense since hes a Hydro, Hydro traits are justice and equality. Nice to see he's gonna be in Fontaine now I wonder if Wanderer will be as well since for every region so far, an Anemo boy has helped us out when we needed it.
3:50 Traveler. Look at traveler. EPIIIICCC.
I've seen a lot of people theorize that Childe will die because his real name [Ajax] is based off a greek guy that dies. But I think that's more symbolic. As a kid his father would tell him the history behind his name amd hero tales, and he wanted to be an adventurer too. But he couldn't. So Ajax, the kid who wanted to be a hero died. He had to be killed to survive in the abyss. Only Tartaglia exists now.
i dont care what you say im pronouncing focalors as “folkalors”
Omg I read all the comments and there is soooo many people who love how childe is in the main storyy ……..I am so exciting😭💗
OMG I wanna see daddy childe fightinggg😭😭
the voicessssssss omgggggg
This Trailer literally is a short movie and it happens SO MUCH. 😱 I'm mentally not ready to leave Sumeru but I wanna see what happens to my bby Aether and what's with Childe, his Vision and another Dragon!!! And I'm afraid my huge Thalassophobie will kick in. 🤣♥️♥️♥️♥️
Looks like I'm going to have to buff up Tartaglia some more. He might be necessary in all this.
3:27 OH NO IT’S RAINING *IN THE CITY*
I can't wait any longer  ❤ this looks amazing bravo 🎉
3:57 эта тянка с двумя охранниками будто: 🥵🥵🥵
Ах, какая прелесть! Уже не терпится узреть это великолепное шоу
Извините, но... Чайльд/Тарталья такой:вашу честь, прошу учесть, еб@л я вас и вашу честь. Я его адвокат.  Божечки, быстрее хочу Тарталью в сюжете
Im so glad main city is from marble not wood
I will miss sumeru
Gameplay looks amazing. Better the. Inuzuma for sure
This campaign It will feature rebellions, revelations, betrayals and enemy to friends all in one, hopefully Fontaine will be a long and interesting campaign, also hopefully Fontaine will reveal more about for our lost twin
英語のフリーナちゃんもめちゃくちゃいいなあ
No trains sadly like in hsr. But overall good
What I don’t like about the music when Lyney shows up is how similar the music sounds to the Natlan motif in the Travail trailer🫤 Otherwise, I’m still excited for Fontaine!
OPOPOPOP原始人启动
Good job developers 👍
Wow Steampunk nation ❤❤❤❤❤❤
The way this trailer ended sumeru trailer
在b站看完再来油管看一遍😪
My PC is broken fountaine is nearly here what Am I going to do?  😭
wait. A trailer...where traveler speaks? o.o
"Here comes the finale!" -The official burst line "Here comes my magnificent finale!" -My fanmade burst line Coincidence? I THINK NOT
France looking good this update🔥🔥🔥🔥
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'VE KEPT SUMERU'S STORYLINE'S WRITER FOR FONTAINE PLEASEE
Who else thinks Childe is a distraction again?
Can't wait
childeeee but where your vision go
adachi ?
Я бы похлопал, но я ем
MY JAW DROPPED WHEN I SAW THIS!!
Cant wait to see what's going to happen in the story!!!
Where is it arlecchino?
Hyped for fontaine
Да начнётся треш
If I had ideas how to improve this game can i somewhere posted that or it´s just a closed concept?
I like childe😊
I am a childe simp.
Childe is the best character here, i love him qnd hes my favorite, he has the BEST entrance everywhere. I love how hes in the trailer
Amazing
CHILDEEEEEEE YEAHHHHH
as a hydro lover from the start of the game im very excited for fontaine
Alright genshin... I'll pull full for childe 🫡🧡
i am STILL waiting for an ace attorney crossover for fontaine.
I really love this 🎮😊😊😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Best part start here: 2:09 ❤
4:06 Don't know why this is fascinating with the vocal and drama from characters ❤
Ahh, i miss altisia..
AYOO CHILDE GONNA BE THERE!
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0:20
This whole trailer was so hype! This just made me more excited for Fontaine dangit. Plus, Childe is here!
This one didn't really scream "Amazing Phantasy" since the stereotypical Steampunk Victorian city has been done into the concepts grave, literally, it feels like the concept was unburied for this lol. However, I do like the fact that Tartaglia is suddenly there to sorta churn the mix quite a bit.  Still not sure if I would come back though lol. Fontain at one point would have been THEE thing I would have played Genshin for, but I lost interest before it came out.
CHILDE CARRIED     AND I LOVE NEUVILLETE & FOCALORS
Cool trailer, the events made me tired before even trying the update. I think I'm keeping genshin deleted
can someone tell me the name of the ost that plays between around 3.00 and 4.00
Even the boss have lover💀
Rebelion of machine's? Interesting. I like Fontain . Good trailer 😁👍
CHILDEEE
I screamed so loud when I saw childe. What are you doing there☠️
Genshin Impact try not to make a god look like a child challange (impossible)
Imma hop genshin and get ready for all the bosses
The trailer is really beautifull insane
NAH BUT LISTEN I DON'T EVEN PLAY GENSHIN BUT I CRIED DURING THIS TRAILER LIKE WHY IS EVERYTHING SO PRETTYYYYYYY
IM SO EXCITED.
Uooooh😭💢
So we finally learn how to swim underwater?
Mdr des gendarmes
FONTAINE LOOKS AMAZING!! Also the first character to have freckles!! ALSO CHILDE IS RETURNING! Ok the archon quests are always the best ones in Genshin so I’m so EXCITED!!
Insane 😩 Fontaine is so gorgeous! even the characters omg. Can’t wait what lore/story Fontaine has in store for Travelers, it’s like there’s mystery/crime going on here 🫢 (Aether at 3:56 😩) ….and Childe is baaaaackkk!!!!
I Didnt See Childe Wearing his Vision.....
Exploration will be.......fun
ANJAY
Who wait for Katherine in fontain 😂😂
Storage
I am just thinking of how many memes will come out of this 😂
Date of release?
4:18
I'm crying, I don't have space on any device to play genshin normally... Developers could you compress the game a little bit please🥺 I really want to play genshin
OMGGG 🎉🎉😮😮 SE PODRA NADAR DEBAJO DEL AGUA??
FONTAINE is the MATRIX?!?!?
Me hizo llorar de emocion
Lyneys theme is so good in this trailer
Focalors = Hydro Hu tao
seeing the trailer views drops every new region, made me think genshin getting boring
ждем)
im surprised this boring game still have base player ahahha
LYNEY OMG OMGGG💕💐
Hoyoverse never ceases to impress us with their trailers
What’s up with Focalors right eye in 4:02?
4:19
If they dont bring yanfei in for a court scene in going crazy
What if the focalors in the chair is a fake and the true one is trapped in the Oratrice by Arlecchino, while one of her orphan puppet helpers acts as focalors
Man this region my fav so far
AIGHT LETS USE CRYO FOR THE GAME
anyone else genuinely baffled at how so many people think lynette dies there in the tank?
Mr. Toys Salesmen came in to save the day.
Wait tf is Childe doing over there
O CHILDE DO NADA MEU DEUS
"hey girlie... Hold still" 😩😩
3:06 I just like the faraway shot of the stage.. it makes them look vunerable
Another rumor made of the fatui and another show of arlechino happy Day for the opera
I LOVE FONTAINEE!!!💣💣
oh my god
Twinks
Why does Focalors sound like Fishcl💀
mi computador todo cagao ya no da más
не цепляет...так же всё какое-то детсадовское)) персонажи в серьез вообще не воспринимаются...ясельная группа.
Focalors❤❤❤ 0:20
Man i hope underwater is like desert. 50% ish of the region
this place looks like Dubai just city without meaning, with emptiness inside, just for earn more money from people. Same i can say about the whole game.
3:45 Ok someone fill me in here, but clearly Aether spoke in the trailer. That was Zack Aguilar’s voice. Have they let the traveler speak in other trailers recently ?
Why do I feel like hydro archon is the antagonist here
Is anyone getting Fischl vibes from Focalors VA? Or is it just me?
Man one week left
french quaso baguettey bratty archon! thanks hoyo :)
Finally, hydro claymore
The childe jumpscare got me fr
Please bring a vehicle in the game. Riding dragons will be cool but I will be happy even with a Mr. Bean's car. It takes forever to get from one place to another.
MADAFAKING JPELIROJO ENTRA EN ESCENAAAAAAAAAA 🔥🔥🔥
Finalmente águaaaa
Finally a bratty archon
Watching this after Natlans been released gives so much nostalgia
Finally Fontaine
SO COOL I LOVE IT
Can’t lie watching all the X.0 trailers back to back Fontaine feels like it’s lacking something, may just be that the sumeru music went too hard tho
I just want arlecchino and freminet
ТАМ БУДЕТ ТАРТАЛЬЯ ?!?!?!?!??!
Mehh..
Focalor be fischel number two
i dont think my pc can handle this 🥲
Navia so cool.
OH MY GOD THATS TAYLOR SWIFT !!!
We all Know childe Hard Carried the hype for Fontaine
I wonder what the glowing cubes are. are they in 4.0? or is it like sumeru desert where they come at a later patch but are visible from mainland.
mid
fosalore????? WTFFFFFFF WHY NOT FOKALORE!!!!!>!>!!?!?<!<faoiwhsuognb
duddee i just deleted genshin cuz i have no space TvT i already miss playing it and CHILDE IS GONNA APPEAR AGAINNN LETS GOOOOO!!! >V<FONTAINE IS GONNA BE RLLY AMAZING
Even though she is not shown, I believe the Harbinger that trinkets with robots (i forgot her name) will have a backend role in the development of Fontaine
Man i loved sumeru bc of its size. Long quests and massive sands are cool. I hope fontaine gives same feel
I HAVEN'T PLAYED SINCE VERSION 3.0?? SINCE WHEN WAS IT VERSION 4.0? ALL OF A SUDDEN....
Hold on do i wanna play this game again hold on, except too much text more cutscenes
A tyranical ruler, being over revolted against for its unfair 'justice' while the 1st estate and the 2nd estate are in power while everybody else is treated like animals. Sounds an awful lot like the revolution.
It looks like the traveller has been, well charge with crimes. It would be fun to see a revolution happened,  just like it did on france centuries ago.
Меня одного прорвало с трубы которой мы будем сражаться, надеюсь это не как с рыбой
Uma das nações mais complicadas que vai literalmente mudar todo o jogo de genshin impact, isso vai atrair Muiita gente com exploração embaixo d'água. Inclusive vai trazer os players antigos de volta! Obrigado genshin por tudo e pelos conteúdos do jogo sempre estarem atualizando. ❤
Me preparing my build for freminet: yipee
Vamos a ver... ¿para cuando nos daran doblajes en castellano y español latino?. Ya estoy cansado de leer los subtitulos, de hecho es increible que ya van casi 3 años y no hacen doblajes al español. Genshin impact es famoso en españa, eeuu y toda latinoamerica, ¿como es posible que si les den dobajes a los coreanos que son un país mas pequeño en población, a comparación de nosotros los hispanohablantes?. Yo hasta me crearia otra cuenta para volverme a ver toda la historia en mi idioma, para leer ya me basta leyendo el manga de genshin. No quiero mas subtitulos, necesitamos los doblajes.
is no one gonna ask if lynettes gonna be alive or not-
childe is everywhere
21:6 ratio for this trailer is such a surprising choice
CHILDEEEE
Haven't played since Wanderer first banner due to PC issues but man I really miss this game
Фатуи в одном из квестов Сумеру: "Со своим уставом в чужой монастырь не ходят" Чайльд: 4:30
Better be good.
When is comming
Bro my phone's gonna blow up after this update
The big dresses are so pretty I hope they make a character with that type of fit
Boring
Please Hoyoverse, make Genshin Cloud be free unlimited time playing 🥹🥺
No hate but childe, get out. Now.
Uh.... Is Childe's vision not in its usual place?
Foçalors
LES GO CHILDE
Should release a 6 stars character to make genshin op
Tartaglia!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Sumeru trailer was more excitement than this
之前還在哔哩哔哩看的，沒想到跨海跑到這來了
lag banh máy
Watched this for the first time and Childe we meet again, pretty sure that guy is Dottore right, a battle with Childe on our side 😀  (P.S. I didn't watch the special program as I don't want to spoil my experience in the gameplay so forgive me if I mess up the names haha)
Who else's in the "no storage space" gang?
YAY CHILDEEEEE
wtf is dat altisia city from ff15?
"The Doctor" is the harbinger in Fontaine right?
They need to add an aussie guy or something Australian into this game. It would had some humor and stuff. Mostly likley they will not but they should?
i’m sorry but 3.0 solos 4.0
Genshin if reading the comments please increase resin
а чё там тарталья забыл?
Фонтейн - это страна Femboy.
Huh, so this is where all my primogem money went
Великолепно
GAH I STULL NEED TO FINISH SUMERU NOAAA THISOOKS SO COOL
Am i the only one who thinks the twins are hiding something...there magician motif the fact a incident at one of there shows is the reason you go to trail  The fact they seem to reference phantoms and illusions...i have a wackjob theory there working with arlecchino towards a goal...i just dunno what she would do besides the gnosis...
Focalors EN VA effin nailed her personality
But has the story telling improved ?!?
Here we go  istg i want to hear childe's :hey girlie" as he comes to save the day again
now THIS is how you introduce a nation
we need genshin impact 120 fps mode for  pc
So glad this nations main city is from marble not wood
Tremenda mrda
Why do i think that the hydro archon will be so annoying😭
Hyped for some rock and roll from the nation of music
Amazing trailer and the characters. No my primos are sobing coz i want them but its not enough primo😢
Trailer seems great, story seems fantastic, gameplay will probably be 95% unskippable filler story that no one cares about.
Welp, here we go again
TAYLOR SWIFT???
Nation of taking my mobile data 😎
¡Esta Súper Épico! 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆🙂, ¡ahorro Mis Protogemas!
Man we about to be a criminal
childe AGAIN!?🙂
Childe... Again...
Are we finally going to get a hydro claymore character at fountain?
1:19 Sister? One’s a cat and one isn’t.
VIVE LA RÈVOLUTION!
I'm going to French press Focalors.
Nation of justice. but seems to lack it hmmmmm
My phone after update to Fontaine: 🪨
Với một con nghiện hệ thủy và nước nhue t chắc chắn thủy quốc sẽ là nơi t ngủ ở trỏng luôn=)))
is that TAYLOR SWIFT????? 3:27
I'm so excited for Fontaine!!!!
bro childes in every nation mr.worldwide is canon
the trailer is amazing but this is gamma make my pc go on fire
I really love  Lenney's  Theme
You know the story is good when you see yo boy child in it
Man i cant believe its in less than a week
Why does Focalor’s VA remind me of Fischl 🥲
My childeee finallyyyy
Focalors GOD❤
Prepare to spend more than 100€ to get a character and an extra 50/100€ for the weapon !  Prepare to have more dialogue you CAN'T skip Prepare to have still an empty multiplayer   Genshin 4.0 !
Its raining right now. how iconic
I hope they make traveller stronger. I have been wanting to play him but he just isn't strong enough after liyue
Me before childe came in:Ay we got these new hype characters let’s go Me after:😮‍💨🤌a masterpiece
The Saitama and Tatsumaki meme is so fitting to Focalors 😂 its so funny it that Tatsumaki actually fits her character.
I don’t trust Lyney. Something about him doesn’t sit right with me
Pipe sword lets go
childe is here to the to the rescue 😆😆
childe is baaaaaaaaaaaaccccccckkkkkkkkkkkkk
Did l see Lynette drowning 😢it makes me angry😡
STOP I HAVENT FINISHED THE SEMRU ARCHON QUEST
Fontaine...    *smirks in Ayaka*
My whole body is shaking with excitement trying to not freak out Sitting in my therpists waiting room
Why does Lyney remind me of diluc in a way
The eleventh is back and i couldn’t be happier
My Borja in’s is shaking
Hydro archon sounds like fischl
CHILDE ????? QAYOOOOO
This is the reason i will re upload genshin impact for the fifth time
I'm not sure exactly when it began 0:05 But a prophecy has been circulating around Fontaine... 0:09 The people will all be dissolved into the waters 0:12 And only the Hydro Archon will remain, weeping on her throne... 0:20 I, Focalors, hereby welcome you to the nation of Hydro 0:25 And acknowledge the value and significance of your trip 0:30 Now 0:31 You may rejoice in this! 0:40 In your opinion 0:41 Do you think it's right 0:42 To treat a trial like it's an opera? 0:48 To the people of Fontaine 0:49 The line between a trial and a performance can be a little blurred... 0:54 Welcome, one and all, to the Opera Epiclese! 0:58 Watch carefully now 1:01 Blink 1:02 And you might miss it! 1:16 Step right up! 1:20 And over here is my sister 1:22 Lynette 1:22 Who will be working as my wonderful assistant 1:25 Tada~ 1:31 Step on up! 1:35 Let the magic begin! 1:38 Here comes the finale! 2:04 I want to spend some time at the bottom of the sea... 2:07 In peace 2:13 Get in gear 2:22 Going under 2:26 If you look up at the sky from far enough underwater 2:29 Even the sun is soft on the eyes 2:33 These fossils are all that's left of these beautiful creatures... 2:37 I wonder how long before the rest of the world 2:39 Becomes part of this underwater museum, too? 2:51 I'm... 2:53 Wait, who am I...? 3:03 The water is gradually swallowing our memories... 3:10 It won't be long 3:11 Before it swallows us 3:14 We've been trying to find out how the Oratrice operates 3:17 We want to know why it has a consciousness? 3:20 Why can it deliver sentences accurately? 3:26 Rain... It's raining 3:32 We must know all we can about this nation's secrets 3:35 In order to deal with that prophesied crisis 3:40 Is this... part of the show? 3:43 You've got to be kidding! 3:45 What happened!? 3:47 Charges have now been pressed 3:49 And as such, a trial is in order 3:53 Therefore, you would be wise 3:54 To tell everything you know 3:56 And seek the protection of the Gardes 3:58 Dear god... It's a whole army of Gardemeks... 4:02 I believe 4:03 This is indeed the "finale" 4:07 Your so-called justice 4:08 Your beloved drama 4:10 While turning a blind eye to the suffering of the people! 4:13 In your eyes 4:14 The value of a human life is nothing compared to those cold laws you hold so dear 4:25 So this is how justice is done in Fontaine 4:27 What a joke 4:30 You've got your rules... 4:33 Well, I've got mine too!
I can imagine players drowning more often than usual after this update🤔
of course there has to be childe in fontaine🙄🙄🙄
Wooo more beautiful garbage. Cant wait for a whole bunch of nothing to happen and then  wait again for 5.0
4:19 Mr Worldwide
I love how childe is in the main story
Omg chiiildeeeee my boooooooooyyy
Where have I heard freminet's voice before 🤔
Tartag 🔥
where is riottheslay
who's praying for contains to come out faster because I'm about to start picking my skin off until contains is here
guys guys the geo lady was saying "Rain..It's raining" seems like an important part of the story and shes standing in the city. rain in cities finally?
looks like i'm getting my childe constellations lol
Almost makes me wanna comeback... Then I remember about the ruthless rng in artifact farming and picking up rocks and flowers to level up characters
childe mc momment sheesh
Calling it now folcare will be considered the first evil archon. Not misunderstood like Baal. Not carefree like zhongli not a dufus like venti or  a slacker like nahida. I get bad vibes from the hydro archon
0:47
3:55 - 4:00 WHO is that on the floor? there's some kind of red aura/energy coming out of him . perhaps its similar to the aura coming from red crystal which we purified in Monstadt?
So the dual lyn characters that was teased from day one is dashed. So much for that. Looks ok overall.
Nice, a pitty I am stuck in a low traveler level so I can't even arrive to Sumeru yet. XD
where's the short emo anemo boy😢
Am I the only one that desires to be a va for hoyoverse
HE IS BACK, MY LITTLE CARROT IS BACK
I wanna see how scara swims with his big hat. Or mona
i'm so excited!
4:19 4:25 4:35 Is crazy😭
As much as I like the fatui, it's quite irritating how they just can't stop digging into other's business😭😭
Man im excited strongboxes are getting more artifacts  to them
LYNYS LITTLE CAT IN A HAT THING😭🩵
Tartaglia ehh? ChiLumi fans gonna start again
Who is the narrator?
Man i love that fontaines city doesn't use wood. only marble/stone
Step on up (me)
I love this trailer
Very nice. But we didnt see much of the underground
yes childe is here!!
IM SCREAMING CRYING AND THROWING UP IM SO EXITED 😆
After this one more gnosis. assuming we claim this one successfully.
We want genshin impact in xbox series s 😎 with 4k 60 Fps 🤩
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tartiggles!
why tartaglia there?
Same trash, game has hardly evolved, still no skip dialogue button, physical stealth nerf every patch, gameplay is stagnant, it’s a minigame and visual novel simulator.  They really dropped the ball with this game.
fontaine!!
Bioshock Infinite is as good as ever!
YOOOO MY BOY TARTAGLIA IS BAAAACK, WB CHILDE
At least the situation doesn't seem as worse as it was in Inazuma quest
Hell yeah my Childe back on spotlight
You can see childe in every country ☺️
Get these boys some pants... lmao
childe gon die in fontaine :(
Here we go... Another update*
I really want to get Lyney but I don't understand why they made him a bow user and not a catalyst when he's literally a magician.
I, fossalore here by welcome you to the nation of HYDROOU, so perfect!!! 😍
Theory: Something 500 years ago happened and focalors was the only survivor
cant wait i hated sumeru
IM CRYINGGGGGG THIS IS SO COOOOOOOL T - T
I THOUGHT FREMINET WAS A FEMALE NOT MALE 😨😨😨
CHILDE???
Bro the tartaglia part got me off my seat im so excited to see what happens in the story 👀
Ufff esto va a estar buenísimo, me recuerda a lo que paso en Inazuma
Ver a tartaglia me ha hecho gritar de la emoción, espero que tenga un papel decente en la trama
Man i am excited to see how the story will play out. So many good ideas here
Leyney'in 3.34'deki bakışı  Sanki o bilmediğimiz fatui çıkacak gibi  😥Eğer gerçekten o fatui ise Leyney'le savaşmayı bekliyorum👌👍
I HAVENT EVEN STARTED SUMMERU
Childe's on his way to drown more people
Main city cool.
fontaine is the only reason why i am playing genshin again
Hope i have enough place on ny phone
Мне кажется что голос гидро архонта похож на голос фишль..
I just love the drama.
I cant wait to play😄
nah it isnt good as when inazuma came out 😢 those where really good times
where Arlecchino?
what is childe doing in fontaine
when you don’t have any storage left
OMG TARTAGLIA
The strangeness of it all that I'm more hyped for Kafka tomorrow than Fontaine coming
When childe game it gave me goosebumps 🔥🔥
Interesting… Why Tartaglia was in there?
I love this sm❤
Childe by my side😚 Whooooohooo💙
3:40 is it just me or it sounds like klee's voice ???
Amazing as always.
Удивили, конечно, но примогемов всё равно мало.
I'm gonna eat this place up
Wait I thought Freminet is a girl-
can't wait aaaaaaa
Fosalor?  anyway can't wait for Lady Maria's full kit, I hope she'll be playable in the current meta
Всё ясно Фонтейн - это большой Санкт-Петербург
Wherss childe vision?
BRO I SCREAMED CHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILDE MY MAN IS BACK YES
мой Тарталья.. жду тебя, моя прелесть
Its time..... To come back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Смотрю и плачу, представляя сколько это весит🥲
Trailer is amazing, can't wait to take part in another adventure with the traveler.  I believe no one was expecting for Childe(Tartaglia) 🏹💧❤️ to be back in game, you can't believe how long I have been waiting to see him again in arc story  Can't wait for version 4.0 to come out 🎉😊
And I think Lynette "dissolving" into the water is really just part of a trick, because y'all can see from the first Fontaine full trailer with Arlecchino in it, the first thing they literally show is "Lyney and Lynette's magic show!" As he exclaim, "Ladies and gentlemen, she DID it!" With the water tank on the background. Probably the end of their trick. Nah. The real show is what comes after most likely. That and Genshin likes mixing up trailer dialogues for funsies. Also, I crack pot theorize that the magical siblings are not actually true Fontainians(?) cause they keep saying "THIS nation's" instead of "OUR" as if they don't belong, but I dunno. Guess we'll see. =) Plus the Arlecchino clapping bit.
Я В ПОЛНОМ ВОСТОРГЕ 😭😭
ajax my son is BACK
Imagine using anly Nilou againts the robot dancer couple (dance Battle!!!)
I lost my account,😢 idk what to do anymore
АААААА ТАРТАЛЬЯ МАЛЬЧИК МОЙ
worst update
Я удивлена появлению тартальи
My absolutely dismay at seeing Childe appear. Will post an actual comment later. Edit: Upon rewatching, I realized the inclusion of the purposed idea of Water Memory. This isn’t a new concept (storytellers tying connections to “memories” and “water” has been done a few times already, but I still love to see the inclusion of it here). It’s also interesting to see it be done in a way that instead of water retaining memories or past events, it seems as though it’s *stealing* memories of those in Fontaine. Judging by the trailer, it seems that it’s also stealing away people entirely… very interesting. It seems like we’re getting a welcome and also being dragged into something beyond us, a usual at this point. But it seems as though we’re also a suspect or witness this time. It looks like we’re also getting a bigger focus on technology and the more technical aspects of world building (I hope at least, I’m a sucker for the little things like laws and regulations). I’m very interested in learning about the court system in Fontaine and if we go into it. I’m curious to see and explore the story. We have a few main themes going on (from what I can tell at first): 1. Memories and Disappearances (and both mixed together) 2. Corruption(???)/Commodification of the courtroom and/or law. ALSO SHOUT OUT TO THE VOICE DIRECTION TEAM FOR PRONOUNCING FOÇALORS WITH AN “SS” SOUND INSTEAD OF A “K”. 🙌 Overall this Region looks absolutely beautiful. It feels like a complete 180° from Sumeru’s more natural designs and architecture, which makes sense in a way. I have a feel there is going to be a LOT of sailing. The industrial aspects of Fontaine are done beautifully and I’m a sucker for steampunk vibes. Also I get the feeling we might— at some point— meet a character who happens to be something like a gentleman thief. It might be the girl fighting with us in the trailer and arguing the value of human life in face of the law.  I’ve been waiting for the Region ever since it was teased… I shall continue to await patiently until it is finally revealed.
I feel like focalors will be like raiden
ohhhhhhh
OMG FOCALORS IM UR BIGGEST FAN
Eww why is ed sheeran there😭😭😭
Каждое обновление ,лучше и лучше 🥰
原神，启动！！
Do you guys think we might meet Kavehs mother somewhere in Fontaine?
Disappointed to see they did not implement a double character mechanic like we'd hoped. It would have been cooler to introduce a new fighting mechanic, after all we're going into steampunk with this one. It feels lazy for all the money they're getting to put the same animations and mechanics all over again.
Childe will save the Traveller again.
Yeah....i know Honkai Star Rail it's cool and stuff but this, this is epic 😮.
This waterpiece is a little bit a fire
So is this the part where we completely disregard who Childe works for and what he’s done? Is he the hero now?
Spoiler : Homeboy has come to Fontaine only to cause chaos, mass murder, fck everything up..and return to Liyue/Shehneznaya ☠️
So is this a Raiden like situation? Where the Archon is the enemy of the people?
😂 Wait and see till childe stole furina's gnosis without even blinking he did it ones  He can do it again.
ngl focalors reminds me of tatsumaki
0:50 is that a spoiler board for future quests? Am I seeing an golden sword there?
I have no idea why but i am excited but also something about fontaine is filling me with dread.
I hope that Traveler finaly will remember that he can talk
yo tartaglia entrance made me mad got goosebumps...i am man childe..hahahahahah
Why i just got burn out when this will come :(
The character animations are just so amazing 😭
This is crazy, the ad, the graphics, the new characters and the new lore is beautifully well done 😭 thank you Hoyo once again
There are some stuff that kinda remind me of Inazuma and Sumeru, like 3:56 looks like we got accused of sth and will be chased (in Inazuma we were also criminals being chased) and 4:13 sounds like some higher ups plotting against the Archon (similar to Inazuma and Sumeru)
Can anyone else explain why the traveler does the hand thing at 3:55 ? He did the same thing in the sumeru quest when they met Dottore and it’s slowly starting to annoy me
Man if you thought Xingqiu was a girl when you started, You would of most likely thought Ferminet was a girl, veteran or beginner.
childe is mr worldwide wtf
This is giving LOL (Legue of Legends) vibes
tartagliaaa!!! yayy!! fontaine is good but i'm just happy to see tartaglia😄😊
I really hope Childe gets to show off his foul legacy transformation again and see how well he fares against an archon…
so far i dont like anything about fontaine
This form of presentation the new events and items at the end is so good. It's quick, clean and beautiful, I love it.  1:25 cute moment.
THAT IS TARTAGLIA???????
when does this update relase?
Меня одно удивило что там делает Тарталья
OMG THIS TRAILER WAS SO JUICY I CANT ❤
OMG IM SO EXCITED IVE BEEN WAITING FOR FONTAINE FOREVERRRRR
i just love that one of the new upcoming weapon is a literal pipe
HOLD ON why doesn't childe have his hydro vision?!
Finally it seems theres a new character who can utelize "The Bell".
CHILDE
Idk if anyone know what I'm referring to but  for some reason this really reminds me of that season from ever after high where the girls would go to wonderland and get stuck in wonderland's school bc of the rules there until they graduate  very reminiscent
CHILDEEEEEEEE
Lezz go were playing ace attorney boys!!
hope they make new old character, i mean playable 2nd and 3rd form of childe or even adult versions of others old character someday
i am now convinced Mondstadt is ancient..
my phone after 4.0: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Everyones talking about childe but  WHAT HAPPENED TO LYNETTE?! IS SHE OKAY 😭
oh is that a physical build archer i wonder 🤔🤔🤔  was kinda looking for long range physical with similar c0 eula damage
where's albedo?
Well, I just hoped Hydro archon would be male.. smh
zamn
rip mobile players ☠️
Childe always comes back🔥🔥🔥
Lyney = Magician Yoimiya Lynette = Anemo Yelan Freminet = Cryo Xinqiu with Kazuha Voice Clorinde = Raiden Shogun with a “Gun” Neuvilette = Villain Zhongli Navia = 5 star Noelle Focalors = Villain Venti  Fontaine Storyline = Inazuma Storyline but water archon
Finally we have a new yelan and kirara
Raiden Shogun still the best 🤌❤️
Man ima pull lynette for sure. I hope to get c2ish bc i wanna main her and i am saving for childe
Lyney Physical bow charge shot and a refreshing normal attack animation ♥ Freminet be like 4* Eula
I’m gonna get a Freminet cosplay i am just like him 🐧
when childe came in i died he's back, guys
tartagliaaaaa mi tilin
I'm sorry.....BUT THE BELL!?
Okay Is no one gonna talk about how LYNETTE LOST HER LEGS IN A PART OF A TRAILER
Navia is giving main character VIBES, def pulling for her 😭
Estes Trailers nunca decepcionam. Fico curioso para saber como será o de Nattlan <3
AHHHH SO EXCITED FOR FONTAINE!
Tada~
GOD
so disappointed its gonna be such a boring up date for the love of god still no updates on the thinks we have been asking for so long no place to use the characters we pull no reason to use the 5s wepons we pull under water exploration went we cant figth good lor its gonna be so bad

2:59 looks like we're getting robot enemies we will fight in the archon quest.  3:33 I think they are trying to destroy Fontaine  4:01 they are attacking Fontaine maybe war  4:28 childe visits
😂😂😂😂😂 0:23
WOW i spot some Bioshock reference ... (Not exactly but im glad its there) This is roughtly what I come to expect from Fountain
Nation of water but my phone is on FIREEE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mobile players may we rest in peace until we can afford a computer    👇
i've got 2 new people I simp for now
2:09 the theme song right here... 🥹♥️
about time we get a futuristic city
the music for this nation is gonna be so amazing omgg
dayum
This game never fails to make me excited
O M G .
the complexity of sumeru's storyline and mechanics hurt my brain, and I hope fontaine does as well
Is hydro archon in 4.2?
I hope we get more underwater in natlan and we can go into the hot springs
CHILDE GOING TO GIVE CHILD SUPPORT
Случилось то, что я боялась больше всего,они засунули в один банер Чжун Ли и Тарталью. Я не знаю кого крутить😭 Мне нужен С1 Тарталья и Чжун Ли😭
im broke hoyo send me some primos pleasee xd
Man I had my doubts when I saw golden troupe on the leaks, this is going to be such a banger for my yae. Also the VAs here are sooo good
THIS IS FIRE
Fontaine sure looks like Altissia from ffxv
this gives me chills every time i watch it, absolutely stunning animations, beautiful character designs, and excellent voice acting and music ! so excited for fontaine ^^
This region gona be wet
✨✨✨This is so cool✨✨✨
ТАРТАЛЬЯ ДААААА
I’m so excited 🤩
Man i wanna swim so badly. I hope i can get childe this patch but then i skip venti for hydro archon.
CAN SOMEONE HELP ME I keep seeing the party joining animations everywhere but I play on mobile and don’t have them
Traveler? Paimon what are you doing here 0:24  this goes to show that aether is the canon timeline even tho i use lumine 😢
Freminets music is perfection
HOLY COW! THAT WAS INSANE! 💜
WHY IS CHILDE HERE HE FINDS A WAY INTO EVERY NAITION JUST GO BACK HOME
Childe think he part of the team 💀
They can definitely make a movie. plsss make one already
¿Nadie va a hablar sobre que en el min 5:34, la línea ley le dio 104k de moras? Jaja
YESSSS CHILDE IS BACK😭😭
The ost at 4:06 gave me chills
WHO IS THIS AT 2:52????!  PLEASE HELP!
Exijo un doblaje oficial del juego al español latino o español españa
Man Fontaine looks dope. I just hope we get mond expansions
the fact that there is gonna be an underwater nation, is just so good
OMGGG CHILDEEEE
do we know who's talking at 4:10? 😭
I'm excited, yet I haven't even finished the desert in sumeru
When will This come out????
It's just Amazing 😭🤍🤍
so the bell will finally have some use
BRO IM SO PSYCHED FOR FONTAIN IVE BEEN WAITING FOR EVER
2.0 had a shorter trailer with way, way more hype than this. Regardless of your opinions about the Inazuma quest and how it was handled in the end, the 2.0 trailer pretty much established in a simple and understadble way the situation, the conflict and the stakes. This trailer tells us nothing about the core of the conflict in Fontaine. You can see that the game already peaked and it's gonna be downhill from now on
TARTAGLIA?!!!!
2:48 3:46
the update I've been waiting for since the beginning
This is so cool, i'm crying🥹
ВАУ ЖДУ С НЕТЕРПЕНИЕМ ВЫХОДА!🎉
OUR CHILDE IS BACK GUYS
OH MY GOD PLEASE DON'T HAVE DUALOGUE BLOAT. PLEASE I BEG LET ME BINGE AS I HAVE BEFORE. I love this game so much 😭 I'm EXCITED
3:43 Did travel actually talk???
As a childe main seehim him is nice.
I laughed so hard when i saw Childe omfg why is this man everywhere
Lynette's body disappears right? its not just me 3:42 -amazing trailer btw!!!!!
Mano do céu, o que o Childe vai aprontar novamente?
❤
omg THATS SOOO COOL I CANT WAIT IM SO EXCIDED LIKE THAT WAS SOOOOO INTRESSTING LIKE IF THAT WAS A MOVIE I WATCH IT ! MILLION TIMESSS
I smell another tartaglia rerun
I'm reallyexcited for tyhis. Fontaine looks amaxzing. The story line everything is amazing. Childe walking in sent me. The way he came in.
No, nope. Still can't believe Lyney and Blade from HSR share the same english va 😂 Wtf is this man's range?!
Omigosh Childe!! A surprised for sure but I do love seeing our jiggle physics man ❤
Childe about to get his vision revoked😭
NAH ALL OF THEM ARE HOT
Add the japanese dub with subtitle please mihoyo you do it right for honkai impact
CHILDE!!!!!!
Got r5 bell just for freminent
arlecchino where??
Bruh fontaine is literally water 7 from one piece
I got excited when i saw childe
Wow, this is intriguing!
Omg ❤❤❤ fontaine
3:48 Do I hear... Jing Yuan?
At last, The Bell has found its rightful owner.
Lmao these robots remind me of the movie robots, and the wheels under the feet too, its so accurate 😂😂
NUEVILLETTE YOU WILL BE MINE
More Complex, more than Inazuma 😮
Amazing.
Показывают новый регион, персонажей, способности и сюжет: Ок, здорово, классно, мгм Появляется Чайлд: ОООО БОЖЕ МОЙ! ЭТО ЖЕ ЧАЙЛД?! НЕ МОГУ ПОВЕРИТЬ! Я СПЛЮ? УЩЕПНИТЕ МЕНЯ
Focalors 💙💙
Focalor's voice ❤
Wow michoyo
TAYLKOR SWIFT OAAAAWAHHHH
Totally not Childe making problems in every single Nation
Uuuh, hoyo, why doesn't tartaglia have his vision?
So, fighting another archon huh.
As someone who is a scuba diver, seeing Freminet makes me really happy because I relate to him on a deep personal level. I haven’t been able to play Genshin because storage from back in 2021 so I have missed a lot but I really hope I be able to catch up
Why does the cryo character use the claymore again? Can't we get a decent ice mage for *once* ? We have 4 that use the sword, 3 that use the polearm, 2 that use the bow, 2 that use the claymore, not *ONE* ice mage. How about some more *Geo* characters? Dendro is the newest and already has more characters than Geo.
0:33 am I gaslighting myself or is that Dottore on the airship?
Animação impecável 😮
Childe is comming nooo!Joker =]]
0:33 is that dottore on the flying ship thingy?
Childe betraying the fatui for us? Hell yeah!~
shivers❗️❗️
Focalors es la arconte hydro?
0:47 omg i saw charlotte
...everyone forgot about the burning tree in sumeru trailer🤔
I'm so excited for Neuvillette!!!
I don't have Childe unfortunately but damn that boi knows how to make an entrance. Lovely
Child literally used his deluaion  The way adter the water tank fell it said charges have now been pressed. The trial has begun i had goosebumps all over this is a masterpiece  Sad it has to come outnin patches i will play fontane from 4.3 cause i want the whole story
There are Ruinguards behind Childe so I bet somehow his younger brother is involved that's why he's standing against Focalors or something
ya know who deserves a hype? hydro mc HAHAHAHHA XD where's his kit hoyoverse XD
Childe the hero of the day
Time to reinstall genshin I guess 😍.. I've been away from it for a year now
look amazing but i still hope genshin will do something about the very limited original resin or the adventure rank rewards it would be cool if you got a single original resin from daily commision it would be nice
cool water bro
Where is the way to celistia??? 😢
"I want to spend some time at the bottom of the sea..., in peace"
These r the things I love about Genshin they always give us something exciting to work on/experience weather we r first timers or pros 👍🏾
If childe die I'll die
is Genshin Impact made in UE or Unity?
………money💵💵💵
Я думал Фонтейн это фонтан на улице... Мне так говорили в тт
THIS IS AMAZING
Что-то мне не зашло новое обновление: персонажи не особо внешне нравятся, некоторые пейзажи очень даже красивые - особенно вид водопадов со стороны, но большинство не очень прям. Когда еще по сюжету знала что будет Фонтейн, очень радовалась и ждала его открытия, представляла много воды и что-то таинственное такое, а по факту цирковые персонажи и локации. Посмотрев теперь трейлер не хочу даже открывать эту локацию, особенно проходить ее. Очень разочарована((((
"the rain...it's raining"
Meanwhile switch players: road to 4 years 🤑
Childe is on fire... I mean on water... I mean on elec - nevermind
navia i ♥ you
Childe again????
"you've got you rules. Well, i've got mine too!" -Childe
The fact I already got freminet's weapon and I literally thought lyney uses a catalyst :/
i hope tartaglia have mastered his delusion
3:56 WHY IS AETHER SAD???? WHY????????? Paimon trying to comfort him is so wholesome but I need some answers.
О нет опять Тарталья, за что
я даже лиюе не прошёл остаеновитесь
Hmm, I would play the Phantom of the Opera theme in my head upon entering Fontaine.
kyaaaaa I'm in love with Fontaine already CHILDE SIMP HERRE
I'm going to cry hoyoverse you have outdone yourself my device possibly and will die from the amount of storage this will take but I love ya'll so I forgive you. YOU BETTER GIVE ME PRIMOGEMS.
People that uses archons as their team: I’m afraid one of you must go.
Meh.
The trailer itself: 😡😦☠️🤖😞😭😱 The events:🥰😇😁😋
This is toooo goood!!!!❤
Тарталья под конец слишком прекрасен
lil scuba man
♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥
опять он
Ya espero que llegue la nueva version. Lo unico q me preocupa es cuanto pesara
CHILDE CHILDE CHILDE
First we had Zhongli's corrosion, then the Irminsul on fire, now we have Focalors alone in a destroyed kingdom being the only survivor. I hope this is not a foreshadowing for whats going to happen in the end of the game.
Yoooooo
Путешественник заговорил ура
honestly this will archon quest be FIRE. AND CHILDES ENTRANCE 💋👨‍🍳
I will not start playing again just because Chile is back. I will not start playing again just because Chile is back. I will not start playing again just because Chile is back. I will not start playing again just because Chile is back. I will not start playing again just because Chile is back. I will not start playing again just because Chile is back.
Fontaine be having a *line* between them and Mondsadt
OH MY GOSH, CHILDE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone looks awesome but Childe just hits different. I can't wait for 4.0 TAT...
Why does everyone sound like Kazuha
Absolutely stunning, i'm really hyped for the new story and region! Though i'm kinda triggered by the fact that they decided to pronounce focalor wrong 😅
childe gonna be a protagonist in fontaine archon quest
WHY IS THE VILLAIN SO HOT
"so this is how justice is done in fontaine, what a joke" You're the 11th of NINE harbingers, YOU'RE THE JOKE
Focalor's accent slayed
My only question is WHAT IS CHILDE DOING IN FONTAINE
Вспоминаю трейлер инадзумы :/ чувствую себя старым
Good lord i’m not even done with nahidas archon quest yet😭
When I say this is “Kangaroo Court” I mean it in the best way possible
THE FRENCH ARE HEREEEEEEEEE
I am so excited to enter Fontaine and meet Navia
give us primos
who is that electro sword user ,she looks like kafta and some kujo sara looks @4:04  if anyone knows comment plz
9 дней
I didn't know I could fall harder for Childe.
I can’t wait for fontain
MC gonna be judged to death and Childe came to the rescue 🎉
Nahh how much GB does Fontaine take?
ed sheeran walks in
Oooooo so epic!🔥🔥🔥 This music, this vibe... I'm waiting for new update 😍😍😍
Bro what Tart be doing in there 💀
Wtf, freminet is a "he"?!
I'm super excited. Can't wait to resonate with Hydro 💧
When will 4.0 be released ?
lyney twinkass
somebody gotta humble childe,like bro youre number 11 of the 9 fatui harbringers
bro every region travellers goes he always becomes  the most wanted like bruuuuhh.
Fontaine just looks like every other Hoyoverse game.
Les français, Ceci est notre pays, soyons fier !
I can’t wait😮😊
Guess that the Oratrice has a similar function mechanic as the Akasha that drives on the power of the Gnosis. If that's true, Fontaine will be dead if the Gnosis is gone. Also, I sense that Celestia may get into some action, when Fontaine has alternate power sources, and its directly above that area
My storage be like: NO PLEASE....I DON'T WANT TO DIE......
freminet is so real hes so me
This was so amazing and beautiful! Good job Genshin! You did amazing once again!
The game Graphic arts very good i like this Game the The characters are great❤
Thủy thần xinh vãi
wait, where is Arlechino?😮
CHILDEEEEE MY LOVE MY BABY MY BEAUTIFUL
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING CHILDE BACK
Is it just me or the Hydro Archon looks a lot like Qiqi?
Too much wotahhh 💀💀💀
Gonna play again for just main story 😂😂
Very nice 😂
Traveler: *In trouble* Childe: time for a grand entrance
the BELL!
Why is Genshin soooo good at making these trailers?
CHILDE??????? BRO?????????????
2:31 Kiana Finality Ultimate
It looks soo much like honkai impact 3rds trailers now
I likes how Lynette say tada~ it’s very cute 🥰
Haciendo fila para llegar a fontine <3
Not only am I excited for this quest in general, but you’re telling me Childe is gonna be here too?! Awesome!! I wonder what role he is going to play. Whether he’s going to stick to being the antagonist, or somehow finding a way to help the traveller. Who knows?
Finally a hydro claymore i never thought id see the day 😊
Lyney: "blink and you might miss it!"  But the only think I'm missing is you coming home😭
Fontaine looks a bit uninspired from this trailer. It's just green hills and shores again, except this time we can dive. I was expecting a lot more clockwork and, well, water from how npcs talked about this place.
Тарталья уже везде походу будет, блин. Может он реально любит путешественницу🤔
I WAS WATCHING JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS A CHILDEEEE
Childe delusion playable when?
WOOOOO IM SO HYPED (only to see childe again)
I can't wait! It's so exciting!🤩🤩
Not childe being in fontaine too😭
Childe!!
I’m going to speed run all my story quests rn just to make sure I can do all of Fontaine
Bro chlorine I swear to god come home plsss I need you🔥🔥🔥
To say I'm excited to see the traveler's hydro attacks is an understatement
I realised something, the trailer doesnt have paimons voice so it sounds more intimidating....imagine if paimon never existed. Respect the voice actor though
Divine nail comes down on fontaine and everyone turns to water maybe
FONTAINE IS GOING TO BE LIT
Actually inazuma trailer Is the best trailer of all nations' trailers until now
bruh..this gave me chills...dayummmmm...pog  cant wait to do the quests
I LOVE THIS SM
Childe can actually be the better MC ngl
I love you Genshin! I love you MihoYo! Oh man! I can't wait!
Where is Genshin Impact in Switch??!!!
The hydro nation feels like Italy ( Venice) & France .
This might be amazing but is the 40 GB worth it?
DID LYNETTE DIE?😢
POV jakarta 2030
After a little bit of digging~  I assume the Oceanid Tail we saw at 2:50 is Egeria which we hear during the First Fontaine Trailer during the Fréminet Underwater Scene.
ANOTHER TARTAGLIA BANNER??? PLS I STILL NEED HIM
Childe!
So we gonna have to fight this archon too she seems similar to ei in that we weren't her target but then became one?
Ok Electro is the Mommy Element, confirmed by Clorinde...
Neuvillette looks so good omg
seems like the bell finally found its owner lmao
Childe not having his Hydro vision might be his way to say that he is against the ways of the hydro archon
cant wait to see all the edits of this in tiktok
oh no, robot ballerina twins... again
Ready to dive 💦
Man underwater so hype
Steampunk!? Awesome!
Is the first time. I like English voice more than Japanese voice
MY BIG SMILE WHEN I SAW CHILDE OMG
“I believe this is indeed the finale” 4:02
My Bennet is Turning C6 Noooooooooo
welp looks like i shall be revived...here we go again people
Man how big the update for mobile and pc
Goodbye phone, goodbye pc...yall are quite expensive. Hope yall survive the update
"Wow, this trailer really captures the imagination! I'm blown away by the beauty of Genshin Impact's world and the exciting battles. The developers have done a great job creating such a unique and immersive experience. I can't wait to plunge into this world and explore all its secrets. 🌟💫"
50/50 Plis. Yelan<3
1:00 Twisted fate if it was anime
LIKE
Fontaine looks amazing.
i miss linyue and spending tine with zhongli so much
Time for another 40-70 gb update as a ps4 user.
OMG THIS IS SO FREAKING AMAZING! IM SO HYPED I CANT WAIT
I like how Freminet hits the screen and Mihoyo just drops the contemporary jazz banger of the decade 1:46
Man fotnaine looks dope. Hope my phone can survive
Sooo.. After being a thief in Monstadt, a suspecter killer in Liyue, and being a rebell in Inazuma. What crime do we need to add to out list of crimes this times? Joining the Mafia?
pookie wookie shcmookie cupcake lovey dovey wovey bbg focalor
Não to tankando o fato da espada da lynet ser um CANO
MY IPAD CANNOT PLEASE T.T (Looks amazing tho)
mmmm its good but in the same time i dont like the characther idk why
Ah mr worldwide is back
WOOOOO FONTAINE IS GOING TO ROCK I CAN’T WAIT THE PLOT IS TOO GOOD TO MISS RIP MY SPACE THO
okay this actually seems cool asf
I am SO excited for this update. Unfortunate I’ll be on a trip when it updates, thankfully I’m ready for all archon quests soon as they’ve arrived.
So surprised Childe's thereeee, fighting against the hydro archon :0
Што... Уже 4.0???? Когда...?
TARTAGALIA
interesting that another character references to "god" at 3:59 , kaveh and now this new character, does that mean some people dont follow archons but a "god" we havent heard about?
Freminet might be my fave. EDIT: BRO HOW MANY TIMES CHILDE GONNA POP OUT?????????????????????????????/
Each nation just keeps getting more advanced than the last  Monstadt are just monkeys by this point
AYO!!!! IS THAT CHILDE?! I'M SOO HYPED!!!!!!!
Everyone is a gangster until the real one walks in. Childe coming to save the day always gives me chills
HELLO?! MY PHONE WILL COMBUST BUT IDC IM SO EXCITED
tartaglia?
childe just randomly showing up was so unexpected lmao
SOCORRO A MINHA MAE ACHOU A NAVIA PARECIDA COM A TAYLOR SWIFTAKSKSKSKAKAKAKAKJDJSJDJSKA
a victorian steampunk-type land AND CHILDE?! ok fine i'll redownload the game <3
AHH CHILDE MR.WORLDWIDE <33
Lynette is like Xiao, Yelan, Keqing and Kirara, also Focalors sounds like fischl
I LOVE TARTAGLIAAA
Will the hutao come out again in 2023?
2:11 I WANT HIM!!!!!!
THE BEST NATION!!!
Not really a fan of EN voice so I'm playing this in mute and subtitle enabled with the JP video in the background as audio.
This is so good omg 🔥
LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!!!
Does... does lynett drown? I mean i know its kinda dark but her body is kinda lifeless in one scene and after that they say charges were pressed i mean... this is a hoyoverse game... just seems too soon
This is the nation of water. And  I am thirsty. Also Focalors really sounds like Mona. Must be the sass.
Not as good as the Inazuma trailer but still, its nice.
I can’t wait
can't believe this is JUST a game, they should make an anime with 7-so on seasons about the places in Teyvat with every dark secrets it had on that place
Бро, у нас ещё 3.9, куда вы так разогнались на 4.0
I need the hydro archon now
comparing the inazuma trailer to this one omg they definitely improved a lot
I'm sorry but I was just chilling and watching this and then Childe comes out of nowhere MAN MY JAW DROPPED
it's _FOCALOR, FOCALOR, FOCALOR._  Anyone who is gonna mention fukin Furina is a 'special' kind of person in my book.
Man fornaine looks dope. I wonder what .1 .2 will be like
How many hydroculus we’ll have to collect that time ? 😅
Wow Fontaine is actually stunning I can’t wait
OMG. Am I theeee only one who found fréminet‘s demo so epic and better than lyney and lynètte‘s
As a performeri am hyped. Wanna see what the city looks like
I need to start saving up
When ur trying to complete the sumeru quests but you’ve gotta do story quests before and you’ve got no keys 😔
in my opinion this is my favourite trailer❤
I’m actually gonna re-download genshin just so I can try and go to Fontaine, it was actually the nation I was always really excited for but got bored waiting 😅
Childe hasn’t been relevant since 2.2 I’m so glad I got to see him again. I pulled for him in 2.2 and I only started the game because of Childe. I started the game in 2.0 but I managed to get both Mona and Childe.  After 2.2 he was never relevant again. I collect Fatui harbingers now(Childe, Scaramouche). I’m so glad I see him playing an important part again.
I guess hoyoverse can't freaking milk out of player by making the Lynette 5 star too. Hehe regulations does has it's meaning..
Jsuis hype ahhhhhhh 🥖🥖
poor charlotte, is not even in the trailer
As someone who loves stage preforming Fontaine is going to be my favorite, can’t wait!!   Edit: “I literally famous” Said almost everyone. Thank you for liking my comment ❤️
Childe made this trailer 1000x better! He will save us!
I LOVE the combat the animations are AmAzInG This game's AWESOME i love it
tada...
I was imagining it even more steampunk-y, but I dig how everyone and everything looks nonetheless.
boring
We now got raiden and sara combined in fountain and i am getting her i already know she is a dps
YIPEEEE :D
Absen
I've re-watched this at least 10 times so far, can't wait for 4.0!!! Edit: can't believe this was 9 months ago, Fontaine is probably the best nation released.
Honestly Fontaine is exactly how I pictured it and I love it!!!!❤❤❤
bro childe just casually showing up on every nation bruh
TARTAGLIA😨😨😨
This nation has SO MUCH potential to become my favorite is almost scary I really hope my computer works well with it
Estava jogando o jogo normalmente até o dia 03/08, até que do nada o jogo parou de funcionar. No caso início o laucher e jogo normalmente até que trava na tela de carregamento que aparece depois do portal que você pressiona qualquer tecla para entrar no game, após travar o jogo fecha e retorna a tela do laucher..... Já reinstalei o jogo 2 vezes realizei o reparo apaguei os recursos baixados, busquei por atualização do jogo e do windows, segurei shift para reduzir os gráficos do jogo e nem uma dessas alternativas resolveram.... Não sei o que mais posso fazer alguém tem uma dica?
Tartaglia is the main character frfr
se vienen cositas..
Rip my phone 🥲
The city remind me 200% Altissia city from FFXV
My storage is gonna flop 💀💀
I just hope that there will be an updats where even we are not in a story quest, we can still see playable characters performing or doing their art like Yunjin and Nilou dancing and Lyney and Lynette doing magic tricks. They can use their idle animations for this to happen because I'm sure that after the story quests and Archon quest, the opera will be a giant empty stage similar to the Sumeru Stage.
its these videos that remind me why i love genshin
A bit underwhelming as a trailer tbh
This trailer giving me the hibigibis
Wow looking forward to this 🥰
Omggggggg
I joined in 3.0, almost 4.0 now🎉
this robot dance, during the war...
And people call this an “anime game” just watch this and there heads would be blown
У хойоверс как всегда прекрасные трейлеры, сколько не смотрю мурашки по коже....я люблю вас💗💗
Oh boy Sharlayan looks great!!!
это..просто...потрясающе..
Is her name Focalors, or Forçalors
Well it’s time to play Genshin again :D
А чо там торт забыл
wow is incredible, i love fontaine
IS KAGGY BACK?!?!? Honestly he could just voice 2 characters
Inazuma 2.0
I have no idea to describe this amazing world
Again eather итэр крч
Noooooooo Childe will gonna die
Are finally going to get electro childe?
TARTAGLIA
Omfgggg im so freaking excited 😭😩 can't wait
Focalors's personality is pure murky water in terms of good vs evil. You really can't tell who is the bad guy in this region.
Damn the teailer is good but i'm not gonna pull for the Fontaine characters but i will gonna pull for zhongli
Such a cute song!!! It deserves a ending song for a slice of life anime
I quit Genshin around the time when we had maybe a little too much of Childe. And seeing the comments now saying how we all collectively kinda miss Tartaglia is kinda great lol
Childe to the rescue again?
That's not how i thought Fontaine would look, but i'm positively suprised
Oh no I can't believe it this is Fontain in the trailer!! I want now 💟 ferment and lennett both is cooooooollll
1:25 that "Tada~" has got to be the cutest thing in the whole trailer
I couldn't count all the times I came seeing this video.
The traveler getting in trouble with every nation is starting to become repetitive and unoriginal now
Finally I won't suffer anymore whit razor as my main dps water for all
The fact we see no Arlechino makes me thinks she's pulling strings in the shadows here... After all, in the last trailer we saw her on a stage. It's gonna be mind-blowing, I just know it!
Freminets theme music is so good
WOO CHILDE
i think this nation will be more interesting than sumeru at least for me
This trailer was not it! Fountain is giving me the ick! And I didn’t see one character that stood out, I expected more, looking forward to trying it out though
Why does focalors lowkey sound like fischl? 😭
wtf, why is the ginger here?
oh hi child
That is very super cool
CHILDE??!?!?!?! WHATTTTT IM SO EXCITEDDD
not childe randomly showing up in fontaine..  tbh at this childe is js our traveling partner we've seen him in almost every nation 😭
fontaine characters beat up ai (real) (not fake)
nfw it drops the DAY before i begin school 💀
Im so excited for this to come out!
Is this Nathan because of how fire the trailer
Where are the sewer rats. This is France no?
MEU AMIGO QUE MARAVILHA
Ohhhh Can't wait for 4.0 to begin!!!😃😃😃
What about 3.9?
I wont have enough primos😢. I might be able to get childe in 4.0 but then i have to skip venti for hydro archon. And i also want alrechinno. Man i dunno what to do
Cant believe childe is back. I wonder if alrechinnco plays a role in fontaine
And thats why Childe is the best character in the godam game  **reference joke**
CHILDE RETURNS!
Haven’t been playing in a while I can’t wait omg
dang..they really made focalor look so sickly psycho. i wish we can see her in action like raiden too, kill one of the harbinger.
absolutely insane, I really hope my laptop can handle this update lmao
4:19 wooh boi Childe is back!
2:10 that's our Bell Kun!
I'm really looking forward to version 4.0. I want to find out the plot of Fontaine as soon as possible and spin new characters. UID: 149926059
林尼宝贝我是你的狗😢
I guess I'll come back when Natlan comes Fontaine is nothing much specially the characters
Hype hype hype
Não esperava o Tartaglia
#FixDehya
dead game
Peut-être une vf avec Fontaine 🤷‍♂️
The fact that Childe officially came out after so long makes the country ten times better in itself.
childe is basically mr worldwide at this point
0:22 sounds like fischl tbh
Childe!!? DAMNNNNNN
Okay I’m gonna start playing genshin again
Im glad they kept tartaglia in there!!!!!!
как обычно, 2 персонажа, что б донатили и слизанные идеи из атомик харт)
when someone or something says who i am it looks like oceanid, I don't know
LYNETTE MY GIRL NONONONNONONONONNO WHAT HAPPENED
NAVIA NO NOT YOU TOO MY QUEEN 😭
I'm a little concerned for the traveler in this region because when Aether took out his weapon right after he starts reaching for his head and paimom trying to comfort/help :(
Very happy for Fontaine. But school starts soon so i can prob play 4.0 but after then i will have less time. 😢
Ok so from what I understood, there is this thing that delivers judgment and prophecy and so far has never been wrong in anything. At some point it delivered a prophecy of Fontaine completely sinking underwater together with it peoples leaving only their beloved archon alone. Then there are group of character that seek to understand how that thing works in order to most likely change their faiths. Also it seems like they suffer from gradual memory loss. There seems to be a character in charge of the court, another character in charger of delivering peoples to the court (in case the ones who are summoned to the court try to escape), they also made some type of mechanics to help deal with that job as well. Archon seems to not have her hands in any of this and is just on stand by watching in amusement? And then, there is someone or something that lost it's memories. Further along Traveler is being judged and Tartaglia gets involved. With this all in mind, I believe we will start of our quest by meeting one of the characters that want to know the secret of the "thing" that delivered the prophecy and traveler will try to help them. Somehow we will be able to enter conciseness of the "thing" and find a lost soul that doesn't even remember who it is? (or perhaps someone that created the "thing")? Thus further angering the court, which will result in traveler being summon to the court and most likely have something revoked from him. I am also gonna assume that memory loss won't effect traveler just like in previous region, Sumeru. However, I do believe something will happen to the traveler inside of the court which would explain why everyone took defensive stance around him as if they were trying to protect traveler. At the end clearly, Childe for some reason helps traveler, most likely would be beneficial to him in someway or to be more exact beneficial to Tsaritsa. However, I don't think this trailer is showing the full story but just a glimpse of it. From previous trailer we were also able to see Arlecchino being involved with Fontaine story, and we also know from previous updates that the whole story doesn't get released all at once. But hey, there is first for everything! I also wouldn't be surprised if Fatui somehow got hold of the "thing" and are manipulating it behind the scenes, which would then explain Arlecchino's involvement. Also it doesn't hurt to take in the account leaks (altho they should be taken with a grain of salt), but Dottore was supposed to make some kind of appearance as well. Which would make even more sense because of Dottore's nature of experimenting, thus making it more sense behind manipulation of the "thing" behind scene. Although these are all mare my speculations, I can't actually wait to find out what is goin on myself once the new version is released.
3:50 is that a cane? or something else?
why do they always leave out lumine-
why do they always leave out lumine-
Incredible! I am so excited for this
2:51 i guess that this character  was the previous hydro archon
ok Fontaine reminds me to Altissia
Its good to see our beloved toy salesman is back in action. I wonder what he'll sell this time
The VA's nailed this one 😍
Gotaaamnn..!
Trailer was cool ,fire , wet.
Oh?! Its reminds me to Hisoka
GAME DON'T YOU DARE TO KILL CHILDE IN THE END OF THE STORY I SWEAR
brilliant!!
😢😢😢 I WANT GENSHIN ON SWITCH PLSS
Lynetteeeeee!!! ❤❤❤
I did law and am now work at advocacy.  I have to say that placing a court as a stage is a genius move indeed.
يعيال يعيال يعيال ايش الي شفتههه!!!!!!!!!!!!
3:59 LOOK SHES A GEO
So Lynette disappears in the water and Lyney gets pinned for murder?
I love the music at 1:55 . Can anyone tell the name? Has hoyoverse released it
I like the boss :D married? hmmm i want know the back story
Censorship is gonna be real painful going forward. I hope I can bear with it until pyro archon.
Тарталья? Доброе утро мой дорогой рыжий друг, что вы тут забыли
Another masterpiece is coming and I’m hella ready for this!!
MY BOI CHILDE IS ALSO HERE 4:20

за торта умножаю
Hyped
So, the main boss is Global warming!?
WE CAN SWIM???
Anyone wanna explain why the female robots in fontaine are THICC AF!, might as well call me william afton cuz im bouta put kids in them robots.
I don’t know who I want, the guy at 3:50 or Childe (who I wanted since the Liyue quest)
1:31 Lynette  become yelan and Xiao at the same time
At long last, I can play with hydro traveler. So hyped.
Bro idk which one is suprising, childe's comeback or the BELL...! I can finally use r5 the bell claymore on the new character lmao
Hydro archon voice just damn good 🔥❤
AYY TARTAGLES
i cant wait for more of the same content that's been rehashed since 2021!
Top
Excited for 4.0 here👋👋👋
Oh my gee ed sheeran and taylor swift collab 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
*childe spawns out of nowhere*
My audible gasp when Childe showed up
Childe: Traveler 2.0 - out now!
21:9? i am confuse
pengen main gensin lagi pliss
оуу, здесь показали способности гидро главного героя
OMG Taylor Swift is a claymore-user.
Tartaglia is life, Tartaglia is love
Now I'm excited for both the lore and music in Fontaine. Hopefully we learn more about the abyss twin, Khaenri'ah, and maybe Hexenzirkel too.  PS. Can't help but notice some similarity of Lynette drowning in water cage to a famous magician, Houdini.
Las ultimates de los nuevos personajes estarían mejor si al convertirse en ''gatos'' se movieran por si solas.
Child nailed it
I hope it's will not be temporary event , but actually will be in story
So here we go again. Something tragic happens, Traveler just HAPPEN to be there, and now he's the center of trouble. Never, change, tabibito. Never change, lmao.
I just recently got Framinetcs weapon (The Bell) so I really want to get him.
So basically its ei all over again but this time its a psycho brat that just wants entertainment. Imma be on childe's side.
A battle between two or three harbinger🤔🤨
The childe stan’s are shaking down the side of their leg 😂😂😂
2:16 so now the useless claymore gets an owner lets goooooooooooooooooooo
Childe is crazy but it’s is going more crazy it become a fighting maniac when ever he goes
Rain in another nation : 😐😐😐 Rain in Fontaine : 😱😱😱💀💀💀
Amazing!
Yes I can’t wait for Fontaine!
Tar Tar Tartaglia Lover of the Snezhnaya's queen There was a cat that really was gone Tar Tar Tartaglia Fatui is a love machine It was a shame how he carried on
Why isnt anyone talking about how some of the charecters visions are not there like in 1:00 lynneys vision on his bow thats on his back is not there and for lynnete in 3:15 her vision js nkt there on her bow thats on her hair even childes vision is missing in the scene where he shows up
Rip the fps
Childeeeeeee finallyyyy he is the main questttttttt!!!!!!!❤️❤️❤️ I can wish for him tooo!!!!
Well done genshin 👏👏👏👏
THE DANCING ROBOTS ARE SO PRETTY!!!! <3
It's been 4 years... and that's all we get 💀
Childe Impact 🎉
у меня телефон не взорвётся?
Я не понимаю что делать (._. 737074800 ID
Please fix subtitles
I've been waiting for Fontaine as my #1 anticipated nation, since that one NPC from Tartarasuna talked about it. Hell, it's design is more AND less than I imagined (originally I thought "St. Fountain II," but I can get down with this architecture.)  Also....      I didn't  know I needed a KSGK for an Archon...
The best part about the trailer is Childe
Wait childe what are you doing here !!!
Fontaine is finally here! Watch me save Focalors from getting judged or drowned
Cant wait to explore it all
You out did yourself here.
my pc will explode...
CHILDE MY BBG
I love when childe shows up and interrupts
Wheres chlorinde? I want her😢
Okay time to come back and finish Sumeru
we should get a special combat system for fatui characters...which allows us using their delusion too.. like after 2 burst 3rd one can b different using delusion. or when health is below 25% then option to swith vision with delusion, or maybe choosing delusion mode will cost some insane amount of hp like 60-70% but it let us enter into delusion mode and both skill n burst will be enhanced with diff kind of ability.  tbh, using that electro mode of childe will look amazing.
you guys are destroying my storage
LEGENDRY WOWW :)
Урааа ещё один гео двурук💃🎉💃🎉💃🎉💃🎉💃🎉💃🎉💃🎉
Hello, how much will the update weigh?
It's going to be cool. I am very glad that Tartaglia will appear in Fontaine's storyline. I am very sorry that some people in China hate the Wanderer UID：744226028
i like how childe just called their court a joke lol, that's probably the truth
i have the theory that the oratrice probably powered by the forcalors gnosis and taking the memories of the ppl of fontaine. but i also believe that forcalors is affected by erosion that she may forgotten her memories and led to follow the law of celestia. BUT GODDAMN THIS TRAILER IS SO GOOD!!!!   edit: wrong spelling ehe
Это просто очень круто! ❤ не обращайте внимание на ваших хейтеров, они просто завидуют, а так очень классно! ❤
WERE GOING TO FRANCE WITH THIS ONE BOYSSS 🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥
Трейлер и подача в целом просто великолепна. Я думаю я не одна, кто на весь дом визжал при появлении милого рыжего мальчика в конце? С нетерпением жду обновления.
Blurred
ПИПЕЦ У МЕНЯ НОЛЬ СЛОВ ОДНИ ЭМОЦИИ
Tartaglia is the one person you love to see and want to see everywhere!!!!!!!!!
3:55 whos that lady with lightning sword? I forgot her name
What if Neuvilette framed Lyney for drowning Lynette, and Lynette is with Neuvilette on the act? It makes sense as he says that ''the trial is in order''? I don't know I'm just speculating
should i spend my 100€ on 4.0 ?🤔
I'm still playing, but I'm already pretty tired of the scam system in the game: scam in twists (3 guarantors flew away to the Song of Broken Pines) and even more fierce scam in artifacts. It is necessary to introduce a guarantor for artifacts: for example, for 199 a player receives random artifacts, and for 200 - a guaranteed artifact he needs with crits. Why only 200? Yes, because there is no guarantee that at the point of the artifact the rolls will fly into the cherished crit damage / crit chance. If you give everything at once to the player, this is bad - but on the other hand, if the player does not get what he deserves for months, he starts to leave, and the solvent audience leaves, buying at least the Moon and BP. So the Chinese should think about this as soon as possible, otherwise, with their scams, they themselves will cut down the branch on which they sit, that is, their breadwinners.
No new geo character?
I'm only comin back for fontaine LESGOOO
you have no idea how excited i am to see childe i feel like I'm going to cry
allright aither have hydro element
坐船进入枫丹的场景有一点像FF15的水城入口哦😌
and i thought fontaine might give us a place that DOESN'T HAVE CRAZY STUFF HAPPENING 25/7
“If you look at the sun under the water, even the sun is soft on the eyes”  Water pressure: Allow me to introduce myself
The music holy molly 😂
Everyone being hyped for the twins Lynette: fckin dies in the trailer
this FONTAINE REMINDS ME OF HSR BELOBOG  vibe SRSLY i had to scream
Ain't no way we're accused of something again 😂
TARTAGLIA?
120 FPS pc ?
Is it me or Childe doesn't have his vision in the clip?
anyone else here who hasnt finished all archon quests and already afraid of the spoiler hell that will come online?
ЧОЧОЧОЧОЧОЧ, ЧТО ТАМ ДЕЛАЕТ ТАРТАЛЬЯ?!
Hellooo Tartartagliaaa
Is it that everybody is ignoring that Lynette's lower body is gone?
omg tartaglia
Oh god why more femboys
And we’re still doing all of this with a dull blade…
Childe is claiming his title as "Mr Worldwide"
Please don't make hydro archon is a healer
4:06
YES THEN CHILDE
Childe what are you doing there ? 😭
Did anyone else notice Childe’s Hydro vision is gone?
AHHHH CHILDEEE❤❤❤
This is might givee reason to come back in Genshin World😂❤
I wonder if what Nahida said was foreshadowing for what is to come in the Fontaine storyline. About a Gnosis being destroyed and awakening the Heavenly Principles.
OMG MORE NEWS OF FONTAINEEE. AND CHILDE AT THE END MADE EVERYTHING BETTER
Finally we will got a beautifull weapons! I'm tired of shapeless stone swords and some kind of runes. Now I will have an elegant aesthetic beautiful weapon
For those who have been begging to know, Fontaine is the Nation of Justice. And it’s style of characters, music, and lore is France.
CLORINDE ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Is it possible to drown paimon underwater?
Yeah. Underwater play. Just as i wished some day.
Everyone can’t shut up about Ajax’s return (which yeah, cool. Beginning of redemption arc??) but what I can’t get over is LYNETTES DELIVERY!!! Of the “The water here is slowly swallowing our memories. It won’t be long before it swallows us” UGH!!! CHILLS!!
Okay- am i tripping? I swear I saw a moment in this video where Lyney says 'The Court and Opera are the same, they both want you to believe them, their lies' or something along these lines- 😂
Gay
i freakin love childe so muchhhhhhhhhh
0:06 oh and Another Prophecy(Fake one lol), She Witnessed the Fall of Gaul? The Counterpart of Fontaine but Presumed being the Violent one?
This place is getting nailed. I'm calling it.
what was the opera being sung around 4:04 ? it sounds so familiar
whats with all the child like archons bruh
The nation I've been waiting fpr since the teyvat Trailer😆
1:46 the melody begins
CHILDE BE COMING BACK LES GOOOOOO 😍😍😍😍😍😍
a childe rerun?
sooooo NOT rolling for this wet marching band archon... i thought it was a joke when we got a sneak peek of Focalor a long while ago but it turned out to be true. Lazy character design
Another electro mommy spotted 🤣
I can't even wait to explore the new world
Genshin has a way of hyping me up even after 4105482 days away
STOP CHILDE YOU'RE MISTER WORLDWIDE
First archon that welcomes us properly
o design de fontaine de modo geral ta excelente, de longe a nação mais estilosa!
What is the ost called
Очень ждём!:)
Can’t wait tell 4.0
So Amazing!
Are we actually gonna be able to swim?? (I’m still in inazuma story quest 😭😭)
Ah😂 yes! The French revolution. People having way too much fun chopping others head of with a mechanical device that signified the progess of the science. I cant believe they bringing this glory chapter of human history into Tevet
CHILDE AYYYY
I want this nonsense to be removed
CHILDE IS BACK BABY GOD THE ONLY EXCITING THING ABOUT THIS TRAILER IS TARTAG
People talking about Focalors and Childe, and even as a Childe simp myself, I'm mainly just in awe at that automaton couple dancing. Their designs and animation is just top tier!!!!
I stopped playing genshin a year ago to focus on my career but I still miss it and hoping to play again 😊

finally you can swim underwater 😍😍😍
the entire trailer was so well done, i got goosebumps watching it.
water
Let me guess Hydro queen is Fishel’s voice actor
I kinda want to speculate that the prophecy implies on the the future look on the city of Fontaine being submerged underwater.   While it might be unlikely that it'll happen — given the fact that they'll be having a complete overhaul on it — I am expecting that it'll become a city encased inside a dome (or maybe even something unique) if it ever happens
oh my. my god.
I am so excited!!!!!
Childe Always sticking his nose where it doesn't belong... AND I LOVE IT!
Childe coming to save the day is going to be my fav part
OMG.... my childe 🤩
If not for the game which is the Traveler's perspective, Childe would be the main character of the story. He literally makes every patch good not to mention his VA is a blessing. I'm really proud to main this archer class ginger head.
Ohh comeone man I just lost my account and now they upload this trailer what the hell man
0:21
I hope the OST will be in the game....
2:52 previous hydro archon maybe?
AHHH live love laugh hoyoverse
Im sooo exited to see child🤩🤩🤩 and the new story
Man i cant believe its so near
Hyped. Only 11 days left
CHIIIIILLLDDDEEEEEEEEE
Childe is always there to bail out the traveler
They forgot about hydro Traveler review 💀
NEUVILLETE OHNMT GODDSD
I would kill for every Fontaine character
Hola, yo me fui de Genshin Impact por la verdad siento que en Genshin Impact no aprecian a la gente que jugamos free to play, solo quieren a la gente que paga, por eso no dan suficientes protogemas gratis y no se puede conseguir buenas armas y ni buenos personajes es más casi no consigues personajes y por lo tanto no se puede avanzar en Genshin Impact y si que hay eventos donde dan protogemas pero no los ganas si no tienes buenas armas y buenos personajes y tampoco puedes subir a los que tienes por para subir los más tienes que pasar una prueba el cual es calabozo el no se puede pasar por no se tiene buenas armas y buenos personajes, por eso ya fui y desinstale el Genshin Impact y me fui a descansar jugando Albion Online.
Fontaine giving me a life back to play genshin, sumeru way too big i dont have time for exploring it😢
2:11 finally the bell claymore have its rightful owner
is childe on our side this is so cool
GOOSEBUMPS OMG
i quit genshin but i always watch the story and listen to the soundtrack
Hoping to get Zhongli!
Well that 4-stars Claymore finally has reached to its owner
This theme and vide reminds me of bioshock
the story keeps getting darker, and explaining more sense why the other sister/brother try to build an army of abyss order, it's so exciting
PLEASE DONT LET CHILDE DIE
Why is Fontaine the most beautiful nation until now? Everything is just too 💖😭 even the couple boss is really beautiful. And Childe with his entrance was on point, I missed my boy in Sumeru but this is better 💖🔥🔥🔥
I don’t know how to say this but the animations/cutscenes look like they would taste good.      ALSO WHAT IS THE GINGER DOING IN FONTAINE?????
lyney gives me chat noir vibes
Yes!
Something tells me we’re going to be getting another Raiden Shogun situation on our hands.
Childe Rerun! WOHOOOOO!!!
Wait they put Orianna in Genshin Impact?
AHHHHHH I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO FONTAIN!!! MY MAJESTIC LOVE NEUVILLETTE!!!
My jaw dropped when I saw Childe. HERE WE GO, Y'ALL
Nothing against people who are excited for 4.0, but i just can't get myself to like this upcoming patch. Im happy I'll get new areas to explore and challanges to do, but I just don't like Fontaines design. The characters just seem boring to me. I'll probably end up skipping most of them unless other players recommend them.
Okay, now I have high hopes that the main quest of this region is a re-interpretation of "The Rose of Versailles," with Childe as Oscar de Jarjayes and the Traveler as Marie Antoinette.
We have yelan at home.   yelan at home:
Bro I love that tartaglia is everywhere. But anyway this is amazing 🤩
Hot take, Focalors is just a more successful Fischl.
CHILDE REDEMPTION ARC?! 🤯🤯
"Faux-shaa-lore"? Is that the correct reading? I thought it was supposed to be pronount "Faux-KAA-lore." Anyway, OOOOOH!! AN AIRSHIP!! Please please PLEASE tell me we get to own one!
Amaizing trailer and poster but.. Why you alway ignore my lumine 🙃🙃
Just imagine diving with Kokomi <3
I think cryo will be the last nation we go to
Childe : pfff robot again?
goosebumps to see the ending of the last trailer 😦
At 0:50 can you see childe flying by as one of the flashes?
there's only one thing I can say after watching this trailer:            QUASO
GENSHIN STARRRRRRRRAIL
I literally was screams all the way through I’m so siked
gonna have fun getting wrecked with my childe because everything is immune to hydro dmg xD
Childe really is everywhere. 😂
Childe’s back!? Yeah, we’re screwed.
Most hyped I’ve been for a new region
The problem that needs solving: Stopping Fontaine from sinking underwater
Childe isn't wearing his vision . . . this isn't a mistake is it? 🫢
Aaaaaaah!!!! I can not wait!
Wher geo
❤❤❤❤
ah yes, the bell. the best weapon in the game 🤡
This patch we finally kill Tartoogabalooga? xD
Fontaine will be the new Atlantis 😈
IMA NEED EVERYONE
Who ever that electro lady was shes cold
Femboy with thigh chokers and thigh highs? I will finally be rolling for a male character for my first time in this game. Vote with your wallets travellers!
MIHOYO IM WAITINGGGG
am i the only who have the urge to punch the Hydro Archon so hard that she flying like a roman from Asterix ?  and i'm so confused to see so much people hyped, personally i'm so disapointed
WHY IS HE EVERYWHERE
That's my main. GUYS THATS MY MAAAAAAIIIIINNNN!!!!! YOU GOOO CHILDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So, you can swim underwater just like in TOF
Im excited for fountain mann!! The new characters design looks so beautiful and the nation is also looking so good!
I THOUGHT THE DISCRIPTION SAID THE STREETS ARE GAY
Will 4.0 bring controller support to android version?
I wonder if Childe is going to help stop the Fontaine crisis
Guys am so excited, i cant wait for Fontaine to come out in Genshin Impact.  Btw, Fontaine is coming out to Genshin Impact on AUGUST 16 2023. Am so over joyed cant wait!!!! 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
IM SO HYPED!!!!😍🫶
LET US REENACT A SCENE FROM THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, COMRADES!   jokes aside, I'm so ready for Fontaine!
AAAAAAA EU TO MUITO ANSIOSAAAA
I thought freminet was a girl 😭😭😭
The way Focalors says "the final" gets me mad🛐✨
I’m just praying my iPad doesn’t turn into a nuclear reactor.
I don't know if I'm the only who loved how the camera angle turn out at 2:20 ❤❤❤
DIOOOOOSS ESTO ES ARTEEE
Anyone notice the being that ask " Who am i"? an see the traveler in the distance. I think the Oratrice reads the memories of people through their visions and thats why the traveler started grabbing for their head in the one scene. but looking forward to the update.
THIS IS SO AMAZING AS EXPECTED NOW IM EXCITED NOW BY THIS NOW
Tartaglia Best Cinematic
Kinda upset the two twins aren't a single character you swap between when you hold Ult or something. But then people couldn't drop untold hundreds on getting a C6 4*
CHILDE????!!??!??
Это лучшее что я видела ❤
WHAT IS CHILDE DOING HERE!!!
CHILDE?! BRO I'M SO EXCITED
i didnt want to give myself spoilers considering every nation i've played so far in the past few months i have known nothing but i think my friends will riot if i hadn't watched this...
is it just me or does everyone in the english dub sound the same maybe its just me
Are we being accused of the attempted murder of Lynette? Genuine question. Also the designs and voices are amazing! I love the story so much! Can't wait for the 14th!!! Also is it just me who gets massive Belobog (Idk how to spell it, but that first world in HSR) vibes from Fontaine?
Clorinde 😻
The three siblings!!!💗💗💗
Better not have Oceanid lore because I missed all of those events
IM SORRY BUT AS A PERSON WHO MAINED MEENA IN DRAGON QUEST HEROES 2  I NEED LYNEY, USING CARDS AS A WEAPON IS JUST SO MYSTICAL, MAGICAL AND I EVEN HAD TO MAKE AN OC THATS USES CARDS AS A WEAPON good thing i have enough primos and garaunteed for him :DD     also i want that robot couple to playable...  I also usedmaya in dqh2 and using the art of dance is so beautiful to look at while fighting enemies... thats why i pulled nilou XD and i need more!!! just imagine them spinning and twirling with like sharp blades killing the enemy aaaa  but they are probably going to be a boss or an npc though... what wrong with being hopeful?
Also I’m hoping we’ll get a new Geo character cause I need new characters to mess abt with
Scuse me WHAAAAAT ?!??!?!?!!? childe CHILLLDDEEE!!!!! WHAT IS OUR SPICY SHNEZNAYAN DIPLOMAT DOING HERE  AND WHY IS HIS ENTRANCE ALWAYS SO EXTRA!!!!!!
Yeah we’re definitely getting arrested at some point
GYATTTTTTTTT
Cat girl? Say no more, I'll be saving my wishes.
BioShock the anime! So beautiful 🤩
The Debate Club finally has a worthy oponent. The Talking Stick will be a top priority weapon.
Never fails to impress!! The drip, the breathtaking scenery, the multilayered, multifaceted environment, the OST that makes you wish it went on forever.   Such love, care and attention to detail continues to be poured into this game. Absolutely no regrets investing into this game. ❤
Тарьталья ты че там забыл...
is the first voice of tighnari or lyney? i'm confused...
Parched and thirsty in the desert, I yearn for even a single drop of water. Version 4.0 releases...  I said a drop, not a deluge!
Ta potente
SLAYYYY CHILDE AHH AHHAHAAH 🥰🥰🥰
FONTAINE FONTAINE FONTAINE FONTAAINENENNENENN
OMG CHILDE MY BABY YESS HES BACK I WINN

(ㅇㅁㅇ)
yooooooo dayyuummmm childeee
Will it be 'titanic' underwater?
bratty archon
Fontaine is gonna be crazy, the story just looks like its going to be amazing, the character designs, the lore, just oh my god. Plus dont forget the fact hyperbloom teams are going to be AMAZING now!!
Anyone else think Fontaine looks suspiciously like Altissia from FFXV 😅
WHERE IS ARLECHINO
Tartaglia made impressive entry! Can’t wait
WHERE DID LYNETTE GO OH MY GOD NOT MY BABY
I can’t wait to explore
como falei desde o lançamento, a maior cidade de todas
Who's that on 2:50?
Am soooo going exited 😊😊❤❤
Calling it now child is ether gonna die or you know get incapacitated  Still using the delusion Hydro vision is no where to be seen 😅 Red flags everywhere Though it could be them hinting there gonna give us access to the delusion as an update to him would surely make his gameplay alot more fun
This is gonna be so much fun to play!
I LOST IT WHEN CHILDE SHOWED UP
No me llamaba la atención Fontaine como tampoco me gusta Francia, pero debo admitir que es una belleza como han desarrollado la nación. Los felicito. Espero que la historia este a mismo nivel.
I just spoiled the game for myself
5/10
Beautiful beautiful!!! ❤❤❤❤
The way my jaw dropped when I saw childe.
can someone get childe out of this update Thank you very much
God
Anyone going to call out that traveler was having some type of headache or something and Paimon looking concerned. Or am I just seeing things.😅
IF WE DON4T GET ANOTHE GENSHIN IMPACT, TELLING THE STORY OF THE OTHER SIBLLING AFTER THIS ONE ENDS I WILL BE MAD
желі, кейіпкерлер, әуен, ел, барлық тіпті жақсы! күтеп жатырмын..
У меня взорвался мозг...
Me mié.
OK BUT THE OST OML 😭😭😭
Inazuma still the best by a mile
3:41 is that Diona???
damn its literally going to make me drown
Is it really the time for my R5LV90 The Bell to shine???
Bruh  childe wanna in all of the tralier😅 he wanna be "that popular girl"
Childe jumpscare
💯🤍✨🔥👱🏻👱🏻‍♀️❤️👏🏻👍🏻
Tell me why I thought fontaine would be a cryo nation 💀
Ui được gặp lại tartaglia rồi hihi<3
I basically quit after 3.6 but I’m thinking about coming back this is fire
i cant wait for the update!
I bet if this was in theaters, the whole crowd would be hyped over Childe's appearance
Ôi .. Childe 🤩🤩
1:46 goes crazy
It’s been three years… where’s the Nintendo switch release?
I lost it when I saw Childe, I LOVE HIM
what's the prophesizes crisis? how does the Oratrice have a consciousness and issue sentences accurately? what's in the underwater museum? what are we getting arrested for? where tf is our sibling? I have so many questions, that's why I keep playing
👀 Guys i think Freminet is gonna replace my Eula.
"I believe, this is, indeed, the "finale" " - And this is what og genshin players feels about 4.0, All or Nothing, Big Comeback or Drop, Shadow and Doomed, This is last chance for veteran players, i don't care about numbers, how many fans are love it or hate it, i only care about quality and veteran players who support and like this game back in the day and still hope for the best, don't screw it, Hoyo, this is indeed the finale for old of admires of GI, this must be not even good, only Great and BIG. But even you screw it with game, Hoyo Mix hold this on shoulders again, Music Archons.
I CANT WAIT AAAAA
Тарталья мега хорош
MR WORLDWIDE MY BELOVED
aaaa que emocion!
GOD IM GONNA FINISH ALL MY QUESTS OMG I NEEDD FONATION HYDRO THING
I'M SO HYPPED
2:57 this specific moment... i love it so much
Inazuma 2.0
Почему в трейлере показали именно эту сцену? Давайте уж весь сюжет одним трейлером перескажем, почему бы и нет  =_="""
CHILDE IS BACK LET'S GOOOOO
0:34 is that dottore on the flying boat???? He kinda looks like him
4:07 idk who's voice this is, but man is it good.
HOLD UP CHILDES GONNA BE THERE!?
Fontaine definitely has jazzy roaring 20s vibes 💙
Focalors my wife can’t wait to get you in my party on Genshin
CARA, O QUE FOI ISSO? Eu já estava surtando de ansiedade para essa nação e o Genshin simplesmente taca na nossa cara essa belezura de país e personagens?! E essa temática de nadar?! Parece que vai ser tão grande...     Ahh, estou ainda mais ansioso agora!!
Inglezzzs aguante el japonés 😎
Lynette’s little “tada~” 😭😭
The entry of Fontaine looks like Altissia from Final Fantasy XV😳😳
I’m so confused, are we skipping 3.9 and going straight to 4.0??
Childe: i dont know where i am, all i know is i want to fight
FONTAINE, LAND OF THE EFFEMINATE MEN IN BOOTY SHORTS!!!   I can't believe the bell was clearly intended for this fontaine character all along 😭
WHY AETHER CRIED?
1:06 nuh uh the fukk you mean phantasmagoria thats fischils thing
childe slayed the entire trailer fr
CHILDE
Noo, where is Childe’s vision after he jumped and flipped 😭
whats wrong with subtitles alll sub came at frist hhahahah
leaving a comment here so i can look back on it 😎
CHIILDDDDDD YESSSS
Fatherless movie
Tartagles jumpscare
4:18
I dont undertand about why the traveller doesnt seek the help of other archons whom he befriended like it would give him reputation and power
Wow it's like i just watched a whole movie
When i see childe, and i tell you, I SCREAMED
soon? hOw sOoN?
Can you name me the song from this ost, please???
0:34 is that Dottore in the air ship👀👀👀
Freminet 🔛🔝
AHHH IT'S FINALLY HERE!!!
CHILDE
Nice we'll finally see childe again
You need to start giving us the chance to go up in the world lvl to have stronger enemies at the open world. The game is so easy that it's boring. We need challenge out of the spyral abyss
relate bgt sama kondisi hukum di Indonesia tumpul keatas tajam kebawah🙄
Well, I left the game a while ago because of the poor internet and my irregular time, but if I continue to play until now, I will probably really enjoy this. I mean everything in it fits what I like 😩🤌
Finally, I'll have something to do again!!
She sounds like fischl lol
This teaser was amazing and the ost is superb! And I squeaked with joy when Childe jumped from above. He really holds the Mr.Worldwide title with a passion! indeed!
2:51 old hydro archon ?
Why does Childe have a vision what happened
Childe.  I LOVE CHILDE
SO HYPE!!!
Don't forget that Hoyo lied on their trailers too. (Irminsul on fire scene?)
the views on this 4.0 trailer seems quite low compared to other ones. A shame really, this one is such a banger.
I'm waiting for neuvillette
The city reminds me of Altissia from Final Fantasy XV. Very nice inspiration :D
Childe is dying, I’m calling it
I just hope Arlecchino will be playable,🥲🥲
Who is the one talking in the beginning?
CHILDEEE❤❤❤❤❤
who’s that hot silver haired man 😍
I love seeing Childe in the main story. As we move on to different regions we leave most characters behind in the main story so it's nice to have some consistency- plus Childe is awesome!
My best friend told me to watch this and now I am obsessed .Love to Lyney and Lynette!!!❤
I saw childe and I gasped. OMG HES BACK.
Fontaine looks so good! But more underground?? Sumeru have me bad ptsd
Ive done nothing but squeal while watching this. Im so excited i have no words
So we have The Drunkard, The Broke, The Stern-Cold, The Imprisoned and now The Bratty
DAMN
I wonder where is Arlecchino hmm
Bro they got some favouritism on Childe fr
Every new region is more advanced...why we won't be able to swim underwater in Mond or Inazuma for example? I wish the regions were also kind of updated, because now, there's so much difference between Mond and Fontaine for example.
AHHH THIS UPDATE IS GONNA BE CRAZZZYY
пожалуй лучшее что вышло после  Ли Юэ
OH MY FREAKIN GOD THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL I AM SO SO SO EXCITED AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! 🥳🥳🥳💖💖💖🤩🤩🤩🤯🤯🤯😆😆😆
Why can’t we just be welcome with opened arms like monstadt and Liyue 😭 I’m tired of fighting for my life 😫
my fav region
By the music of trailer, Fontaine might be the best nation in term of ost and soundtracks
Капец, вроде же только недавно Сумеру вышла...
What is Childe doing there😂
CHILDE????
CHILDE HAS MADE HIS RETURNNNN
Switch?
Damn, I wish I could come back
FURINA TAKE MY MONEY
What is childe doing here 😭LOLL IT looks AWESOME THO
This one looks so much like a movie trailer
Dudeee i cant even hold it 😭😭😭👏🏻..this make me flattered man 😢😢 wanna make genshin my favorite games 😢😢
Ok is hydro traveler better then dendro traveler
kyaaa tatang!!
"Tada" ~❤ sooo cute
I noticed Childe's missing vision 🙂  If anything happens to him Imma riot 👹
I am in LOVE with the music during Lynette's part (1:24)
Childe thinks he's on the team like he didn't try to make Osial destroy Liyue 💀
Y’all correct me if I’m wrong but I don’t think childe has his vision
0:30 to 0:39 there's a floating bit of land in the air surrounded by what looks like the bridges from the loading screen, it doesn't look like Celestia, and these bridges are all over, but don't match the design of Fontaine's main city, I might be looking too far into this, but we might get to see way more about Celestia than we previously knew? You can also see the same bridges at the start of the trailer. There are a lot of these broken bridges throughout Fontaine. Am I looking too far into everything?
Finally, another Geo.
Gak sabar update 4.0
why does the event look like something inside mario games
Alright.. alright childe you have my respect but only for a little bit 😒
As a magician, I am very excited to see how magic is portrayed with Lyney and Lynette!
Well looks like kokomi Will be useless in the game now
That’s why he’s the goat the goat…childe🔛🔝
I hate childe
4:24 As a Childe main this is our thought against those rules  4:30 It's time to crash some machines 🔥
So we not talking about the new oceanid? 💀
Oh my gosh!! I remember when listening to Childe's battle theme I noticed that some parts just sound kinda french-inspired to me and thought,"huh, considering his theme consist of Liyue instuments, he'll probably appear in Fountaine-" and then *BOOM* this drops???
I love how childe just randomly shows up in courtroom
TARTAGLIA?!
Meanwhile me who thought all the time that freminent is a girl 😮
Why doesn’t Childe have a vision???😂😂😂
Man i gotta drive the boy again
qUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Yeah theorists are about to go crazy on this
1:25 TADA
Fellow Childe mains rejoice
chúa hề chi dé đây rồiiiiii
I'll return coz new Archon !!! gotta get em all !!!
With Lyney and Lynette, it’d be interesting if hoyoverse implemented a new team building mechanic centered around relationships. I.e. getting a stat boost if you have like, a team of characters from liyue. Or if a team of Collei and Tighnari (and the buff could be named like “Forest Rangers” or something). Possibilities could be endless with how intertwined some of the character’s lives are with each other!  Super excited for Fontaine in general!!!
Ugly childe came and I quit the video 🥴🙄
Cant wait to pull for furina
Finally I can take a sip on focalors bath water
Wow it's amazing ! I'm so excited
NAHHH THEY ADDING BELOBOG IN GENSHIN????
Tartaglias here again
Childeeeee
The character is certainly interesting, but not one did not interest me, I hope there will be others.
Childe is actually mr.worldwide 😂😂😂
Damn I’m not even finished Sumeru! Excited to get back into this game!
Tartaglia is such a menace
Genshin impact I had to wait a few days before playing the game😢😢
whats childe doing in fontaine 💀
Childe carried this trailer it was completely worthless til he showed up they're just copy pasting their story elements at this point but childe alone was worth seeing again
hope this trailer's music been posted
Anybody notice that the on the first throne at the beginning of the video, you can see a figure? And that it also disappears the next time we see the throne at 2:44?
Man!....so hard for me.
aint no way the bp claymore is called talking stick 💀💀
Where’s Childe’s vision
More like Inazuma 2.0 trailer 🥱
would’ve have been so cool if Lyney and Lynette could have like a burst together, if a player had both have them they could have an option to play them at once and in coop if two players have them they can as well omg !!
I CANT STOP WATCHING LYNETTES DEATH SCENE ITS SO PERFECT I GET CHILLS.
genshin never fails to entertain us!! ❤️❤️
.... Tartaglia no llevaba su vision hidro no? O.o
Focalors gives me Fischl vibes, change my mind.
My Storage 🥲
One could say that the "biais de récence" makes it so that every new thing that comes out looks even better than the last one, but i REALLY. am looking forward to Fontaine.  Sumeru has been an absolute success, but Fontaine will be a master piece.
Hope they give tartaglia a rework so you could use his electro powers
Childe being there....not expected...not expected at all.
Ai need animeeeee
So basically Fontaine is based on Old English aspects during the industrial revolution.
Childe doesnt have a vision.. he is probably using a delusion or smth. Thats fatui childe probably????????
HELP I GOT GOOSEBUMPS THIS IS AMAZING
NEUVILLETTE BABYGIRL
Boring..
Law and Order: Criminal SVU
CHILDE FANS ARE SO WELL FED🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥
CHILDE IS BACK YEHAJDHDKD
awesome
SO EXCITED!!
Ok...time to install it back again... I hate this game so much for being this cool
Focalors is coming and so am i
I just wish they make a movie out of their game😭😭
Dayyyyym another mommy electro!!!!
I AM SO EXCITED AAAAAA
That underwater fish swarm is breathtaking beautiful.
Finally my bell greatsword x230 found it's owner.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This gave me goosebumps I’m so excited
HYPEEE
I hope we get Delusion Childe as a playable character at some point. It's time we got a playable alt version of a character, like Star Rail is already getting with Dan Heng's alt.
damn, i think just watching this is going to drag me back into genshin impact kicking and screaming
I was sitting here happily enjoying the trailer when I saw the same little childe for liyue Literally WHERE DID CHILDE COME FROM? IS ALRECCINO NOT ENOUGH??!! also where was alreccino in this trailer??
Seeing Childe using his delusion is peak hype
oioi
It's serious that the tartaglia will be Present at Fontaine's Arch? Damn... But the trailer is amazing
Ayo tf is Childe doing there was he in china 💀💀
I cant wait for Fontaine! Its gonna be so fire
Mr. WORLDWIDE
FRENCH REVOLUTION LETS GOOOO
Im so excited
I cant wait! 4:28
OMG CHILDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is there mouse Y axis invert in Hydro because if not, I'm not interested
I know it is Hydro Nation but its Hot🔥🔥🔥🔥
I was waiting for Arlecchino but Childe's entrance blew me away
goosebumps when childe made his entrance
The Lyney/Lynette presentation at the beginning is 10/10. So simple but so effective.
The trailer already gave me chills
1:04 его тема напоминает е-лань
It’s same formula again, get new character, farm, explore and do easy quest, then out of content:(
I've always admired the Victorian Era and Opera so to have an Opera House in the game soon, ITS PARADISE!! THANK YOU GENSHIN FOR SHOWING US YOUR IMAGINATIONS OF THE BEAUTIFUL WORLD OF TEYVAT!!
neuvilette looking fineeee asf
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information. I am not affiliated with this website or ministry, they are simply tools that I think may help you!  https://jackhibbs.com/know-god/  https://jackhibbs.com/real-life-basics/
I can’t waittt it looks so good!
OMG we can dive?  i'm so excited!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I , tayy will bring focalors home 💙💙
Freminet is an emo lol😆
So Freminet...is a guy...huh...
After 3 years, we finally get to see Lyney and Lynette in-game 😭
Childe truly is Mr.Worldwide😭
Childe is back?! Sign me up💳💥💳💥💳💥
They forgot about Wriothesley 😭
focalors correction needed 💢
Navia!!..okay i totally saves all for her💛💛💛
Aether and Lyney have something in common I see, their sisters disappeared in front of their eyes
Thanks to everyone who’s been working on Fontaine 😭❤ This is going to be amazing👁️👁️
Ok this is nice cool wow water but we need to talk about childe he most likely is gonna die I mean his everyone speculated it before so if they had the chance they probably would do it in the fountain arc he could possibly fall in battle or get executed for committing crimes in fountain
OMMMMMGGGGGGG IM SO EXCITED
YOO THIS IS SOO COOL
who was the one speaking at 2:53
Childe is back to bring this game back to life
Maybe I'm blind, bus is this Dottore on the plane in 0:34?
In easy words jail escape
can she use a def goblet pleassee???
I’m literally crying this is so amazing I can’t wait!
УРА, МЫ ДОЖДАЛИСЬ, ДОЖДЬ В ГОРОДЕ!
Can't wait to be a another wanted fugitive in a another nation
いのりんの声の良さと日本語の表現の幅広さを実感した。海外ではじゃじゃーんとか一人称を僕って言うこととかを事細かに表現することは難しいからな
THE BELL!!!
was it just me or did the two robots dancing give of NieR:Automatica vibes?
we are all gonna be seated for peak
genshin i think taht you should add french voice language to fit into fontaine who is inspired of france!😂
bro, im not even finished w the inazuma archon quest bc i quitted genshin.
WOWOWOWOWOWOWW OMG
There are some well done male characters. But Liney is who? There are a lot of anime where there are cool images of male characters (I mean appearance) So that it is a normal man, whom you look at and understand that he is dangerous, that he is capable of a lot, that he is normally dressed, and not like a girl with pubertal syndrome. Basically the problem with almost all male characters in genshin is that they look like sugary BOYS.
Fontaine reminds me of a city in FF15
Ya vahui
OMG
AHHHGGGGDHSHSNSMS FONTAINE LOOKS SO OMGFNMFFMDNNCMC
The voice actors and the Music is soooo good I love it
OMG A GENSHIN CHAR THAT HAS FRECKLES
Торт опять спасет нас от переделки?
I’m here for it
OMG IM SO HYPE FOR FONTAINE!! AND OUR BOII CHILDE IS IN FONTAINE TOO🎉 I love the hydro archon, she seems really crazy and unbothered, something must've happen she looks like someone who used to care so much that she got turned into this or she's just like that😂
Tartaglia my son 🥰
So Fontaine is Wano kuni basically
CHILDES ENTRANCE OMGGG
there will be no conclusion to the story as long as the game generates money
Is it planned to make really courageous male characters in genshin? Or will it be a half-boy, half-girl?
What is that Tada~
*вдох* ЧАЙЛЬД, ЧАЙЛЬД, ЧАЙЛЬД!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I really hope Childe will come to help us this time. lol
Childe fans going feral on this one. I'm giggling and curling nt tkes and kicking the air
please mihoyo, my phone cant take it anymore
Idk why but when i watched this I am already thinking that after Fontaine we will go straight to Natlan like both nations will be showed in the same year 😂
I'm not sure if it's part of the plot, but i genuinely think focalors has no "archon-ish" aura whatsoever
I’m so excited
No Alecchino? :(
pretty much the same as always, genshin is getting old quick
I am sooo pumped for 4.0 (really ironic that they skipped 3.9), but anyway, I can't wait for Fontaine once I beat the Sumeru Archon Quests.
I called it. It's based on French revolution
If Childe is back in business then I'm all for it.
Dont gwt me wrong, i love the trailer but 2.0 remains top for me
4:19 YOU TRIED TO HURT MY TRAVELER, NOW I SHOW YOU  HELL!😂😂😂  Childe the Traveler Simp #1
So Freminet's signature weapon is The Bell?
wow, amazing 🤩
This is so amazing!
This is just INCREDIBLE ! Makes me even more hyped for Fontaine, Vive la baguette ! ^^
Mr.worldwide is back again
Lyney turns into a giant hat for his burst… I want him😃
nah my phone's storage 💀
can we talk about how much genshin has improved with their trailers omg??!!? and the underwater exploration i cant believe this is real
Sooooooooo...Fischl got a sidegig as an Archon now?
Marineford☠️
i’m actually so excited i can’t believe fontaine is here
I was not expecting Childe To come to Fontaine..
Freminet will be our best diver for sure
everytime i fall in love with genshin impact again i swear its to good to be true
Do i see it right ? Is that a reference of the movie The prestige of Christopher Nolan ? it make sense now. It's almost the same plot haha
They say heroes arrive late to the rescue and boy oh boy! Childe pulled it off spectacularly!
child fr chad
The game: 😍 the storage: 💀
Where is Childe's Vision?
So eggscited for fountaine!!
As a childe main i approve
when you uninstall genshin but when trying to redownload you can't because you don't have any space..........
Wait why child is her i thought we have don with this guy
Вау!!!!!
CHILDE CHILDE CHILDEEEE!!!!!
I wish fischl can meet focalors
Bruh why tf they gotta make the Hydro archon a loli smh...she had a lot of potential ...i was hoping she would apply "wet " status on all of us but here we are😭😭
Finnally fontaine trailer,well,lets wait,its time to go to the nation of justice!!
I WAS HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The ost is amazing! And the dancing of those beautiful mechanical robots gave me chills. They were absolutely gorgeous ! I'm going to pull for Lyney but I'm not guaranteed and I don't really care because a lot of amazing characters will be coming as I can see ! My kokomi will go so well if I use her for travelling, aaaah I'm so happy ✨ Finally my hydro characters collection will be on stage 🥰  I'm so excited to see Fontaine's content (visual, characters, ost,...), This looks absolutely amazing ! (Though I expected a darker kind of architecture)
CHILDEEEEEE LET'S GOOOOOO AHHHGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH
BRO EVERYONE SHUT UP RINDO KANADE FROM TWEWYS VOICE ACTOR IS GONNA BE IN THIS GAME PLEASE
What ever what i need to see the traveller with hydro power
childe is slaying from 1.0 to 4.0 xDD
i cried on this trailer ❤
Wholy moly! This is epic!!
I love lunette theme music
Is that Lynette scene is like same as Now You See Me (movie) magic show when she pretends like she failed the performance by trapped in that water cage but actually then appear somewhere? INTERESTING ASF
Childe is literally everywhere
VIVA LA REVOLUTION
Those dancing boss looks amazing.
Man I wish I still can play this game but a few update ago is beyond what my laptop could hold
wild HYPE is REAL
Let's go Tartaglia ❤👏🏽.
Mr. Worldwide casually just hopped in to the trailer
NOOOOO YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HP SCALER WITH NO ENERGY ISSUES AND NOT PHYSICAL PDS 😭😭😭😭
Neuvillette: Charges has now been pressed And as such, a trial is in order Therefore, you would be wise to tell everthing you know And seek the protection of the Gods  Venti, Zhongli Raiden & Nahida: I got you homie  (I know the sub title said gardes But I heard it as Gods😭😭)
Tartaglia' s vison is missing. I wonder what pisses him off *that* much
Finally harley come out
CHILDE!!! YESS
Has anyone else noticed how the first image is focalors sitting all alone on her throne?  Feels so ominous
Omg
more tunnels? i get the underwater experience, but not tunnels pls. we still have Natlan, it's much more sensible that a volcanic nation has a lot of caves & tunnels.
0:21 Venti: I am but a simple bard ehe! Zhongli: I can suspiciously recall the last 5000 years in vivid detail Raiden: *tries to kill us the moment we meet her* Nahida: Oh me? I’m just a caged bird…    Furina: I AM THE HYDRO ARCHON, FOCALORS. WELCOME TO FONTAINE, THE NATION OF HYDRO OF WHICH I, FOCALORS, AM THE ARCHON.
The archon is just a Happy Chaos wannabe 🥱.
I thought they were 3 sisters
OMG Child was so fu***** badass in this end!
Lyney is so cool❤
My 64GB iPad storage is trembling in fear
Wooow it is wanderfull! Great job, Hoyoverse 😍
Why did the codes expire so quick?
Mis 32GB (No Bait)💀💀
CHILDE IS BACK YAAASSS
Just one word...GOOSEBUMPS
Childe? Excuse me Childe? He's here???!! Sndjxjjxnx
I'm so excited, I need to catch up on the update
Those 4* weapons look good.
CHİLDE WHAT ARE YOU DOİNG İN FONTAİNE
Did anyone notice that Childe didn’t have his vision at the end?
Lol look like the mr worldwide make his comeback
ah yes, i cannot wait to beat my future enemies with metal pipe.
omg childe
my 512gb disk laptop that is already nearly full after installing the update:
My god. This is beautiful ❤
What i can say? Hmm. Genshin Impact is even more fantastic that it was. Hope it will live forever
Does that trailer hint Focalors has a literal split personality?
CHILDE
A little thing I noticed Charllotte is in the trailer twice at 0:48 and again very briefly at 0:49 I just find it interesting how she is the only character featured in this trailer who's face is not seen directly.
Another patch, another region with beautiful scenery. This arc looks lit 🔥  I’m suddenly remembering how Nahida described Focalors as someone with an “interesting personality” 😂
Where is Childe's Vision?!😮
NEUVILETTES CHUBBY CHEEKS OMG😍
man hoyov never fails to impress, the little details IM SO EXCITED BRUH
Something tells me this 'Oratrice' object causes the crime cases to occur, which in turn causes the trials to happen, and thus it shows the heavenly principles that Fontaine is indeed the pure nation of justice. Maybe its a creation of the new archon, Focalors.  The dancing machine couple seem like an important side quest like the Aranara quests.  And Childe comes to save us in a trial where we are failing to win... as he said in his voicelines that he sees him and and the traveller as the only 2 people who can take over the world, its only natural that he comes to save his comrade. GAH THE CHILLS  Great job Hoyo. Entangling us in mesmirizing story lines yet again.  Edit: haha i was wrong about the dancing robots
sooo. how much space needed for genshin in this new update?
#3:39 wth just happen ........🤐why she got disappeared without clothes ...
This version is beautiful and flawless...🌹♥️
BEST NATION IS FINALLY HEREEEE
IM INLOVE ALREADY
4:25 Bro's back for more and my body is absolutely ready for it.
Ayo are we getting delusion childe???
Whoa, this is wonderful! I like Freminet... and in french pronunciation, he's 'cool cat'! (Frèminet) I like him!
Топ
Всего говорят про торта и лини, а я скажу что форкалор изумительна....
TARTAGLIA MY HUSBAND IS COMING AAAAAAAAAAA
The trailer is so cool. It's a shame Arlecchino didn't appear. By the way, which character is the one talking in the beginning?
of course the hydro archon sounds like a child
а тарталька там что делает
Tartaglia 😍♥ ♥ ♥
CHILDE CHILDE CHILDE WHAAT
now they made Aether usesless again, what a joke
Childe gives chills 🔥🥶
Have a feeling something might happen to childe this time around-
why does it sound like a posh Senator Armstrong at 4:06 ?
что там тарталья делает?
Genshin Impact:Aquatic Update
This trailer legitimately gave me goosebumps man, absolutely amazing!
The more regions show up the more I fell sad for mondstadt. It was the first region and compared to the newer regions it misses a little love and details. It feels a bit empty. Anyway, Fontaine looks amazing and I’m sure my Fischl will be very happy to explore.
oh man, 4.0 incoming, i need to finish sumeru fast, hoho i can't wait
Ohh.. is the one under water the true hydro archon?
好期待啊
nah still waiting for natlan 😢probably next year
So cool and excited to replay genshin for this 🎉
Childe rerun banner? 😅
:Here to remind people they said Genshin is dead
2:12 RPM GET IN GEAR?!!?!?!  2:23 AND HES TRANSFORMED?! OH MY GOD
因何變嗚點⋯悟？
i wonder if childe was there to save us again, or if he was the cause of the chaos for the upcoming archon quest hmmm im so excited!!
Navia is in her fearless era
time to buy a new hard drive
Bro childe premiered in Liyue Whats bro doing three nations later💀
lyney: we got a super AI some fontaine NPC: im building a computer...
This trailer was awesome! :)
why is childe here why can’t they just release dottore🤬🤬🤬
Чайльд 😳что он там забыл?
I can hear the Traveler screaming completely filled with anger: "Focalors!!!"
THE PRESTIGE REFERENCE??
omg! Is it just me or Freminet really look like Felix from Stray Kids? 😳
Childeeeee finally!
I MISSED THE REDEEM CODES AND NOW IM ANGRY I WAS SLEEPING WHY WOULDNT THEY ACCEMTJSKAICMAN 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Bro WHAT! The rest of teyvat are SAVAGES compared to fontaine!!!
The way I gasped
This is so amazing!
Reminds me of france,yk? Like the france in history before the revolution
Ayoooo tartaglia is back!!!!
CHILDE IS IN THE TRAILER?
Another banger update
I don't expect that I scream at Childe part 😂
ТАРТАЛЬЯ В ТРЕЙЛЕРЕ 💥💥💥💥 БОЖЕ, Я ВАС ЛЮБЛЮ
Can we appreciate how they tried their best to make this amazing video for us 💖💖💖
Жду больше Чайльда чем Фонтейн
this is amazing
al fin wow despues de tres mil años y porfavor completen la historia de genshing
LET'S GO!!!! MY PHONE SSD IS READY!!!
I guess this time they messed with childe's family or sumthin. He seemed personally triggered rather than 'fulfilling his duty, as usual'
why does Childe’s eyes look more dead than ever?
It was amazing..damnnn...😯
w trailer
Lynette's quiet tada~ is pure perfection
INAZUMA STILL HIGH
I’m curious as to who did Lynette lose? She’s an anemo after all.. lol
OKAY??? CAME FROM THE GENSHIN WEBSITE AND THIS IS FIRE NGL???
"Ah yes, France"
OMG TARTAGLIA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
As someone who just had started playing the game for only a few weeks, yes please! Already having the a blast exploring and now they're adding another nation.
OMGGGG
bro
Lets goooooo another region. Hyped.
Oh yes, spoil the whole story in 5 minutes. I basically don't need to play the story, because genishin is known for horrible, hours long padding, between minutes of interesting bits. I'll be honest, I have zero interest in any of these characters. As someone who likes mature male characters (Zhongli, Batman, Alhaitham) or females (Jean, Raiden and Yelan), seeing 4 children (Archon included), severely diminishes my excitement now that I've seen the story spoiled.
Barbarians
FIR
I was watching at slow motion around 4.15 and if you watch carefully you'll see Clorinde is actually slicing the robots? So maybe she takes our side later on even tho it seems like we're going to go against her ?
Probably the Oratrice has Furina’s Gnosis.
I screamed when I saw neuvillette, I’ve been waiting so long to see his in game model (he will come home I have so many primos for him)
Wtf is childe doing😂😂😂
genshin is getting lame. where are the badass characters like dilluc  zhongli and childe
Monstadt: a world of nostalgia Liyue: a colorful culture Inazuma: a land full of mood and introspect Sumeru: a place of epics, stories & re-telling Fontaine: ?????
we LOVE genshin  Fontaine HYPE !!!
Wait is Lynette gonna die? Or ....im scared. Pls not Lynette :(
Well anyway, Fontaine Katherine remain the same as ever
Looks awful, glad I quit the game
you know things are screwed up when even Tartaglia said how it is a joke
I WANT LYNEY SO BAAAD KJDWNQFKJNCDINFDJNSDD
Focalor seems to be against us like raiden, except maybe this time the reason is to prevent the people from becoming water?
is beautiful, i first time want see new region 😮❤
Is already region no 5. Still spiral abbys is the only permanent content.
Neuvillette is so handsome 🧎‍♀️
Childe is Back
AYOOO WE HAVE CHILDE TOOOO 😮😮🎉
...i gotta finish sumeru archon quests now...
I CANT WAIT. IF CHILDE, ARLECHINNO IS THERE, THE STORY CAN NEVER GO WRONG
@2:55
CHILDEEEE
hold on, childe really hit us with the “you got your rules, and so do I”   he’s never gonna give us up, never gonna let us down never gonna run around and desert us…
MATT MERCER BABY!!!!!!!
oh my... my fav fatui boy is back too ? and the bioshock and dishonored wibes fontaine gives, together with classical look of everything... i already love this
im so hyped for fontaine❤🤭
It don't rain in cities tho  Except that one time Yelan's charisma won but it generally don't rain in cities
My type is anyone with a hot voice. And im not gonna lie lyn-
God I love this game so much.
Yo Childe. Where ya been. Havent seen you since Inazuma with Yoimiya.
Um did anyone notice how Childe's vision is missing, knowning mihoyo and hoyoverse this is never gonna be a editing error, Theories anyone?
Lyney is hook from hsr
...my jaw dropped
Я во сне видел до этого трейлера точно такой же фонтейн... После фокалорс буду крутить лини какой же он красавец😍
Seems to be a classic WhoDunIt story with Lynette being the focus. Arlecchino being the cause and Tartaglia trying to prove the Traveler's innocence. With Arlecchino being a Harlequin. She's the most crazy out of the Harbingers. We shall see. I'm immediately excited. Whether I'm wrong or right.
CHILDE'S BACK LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This gonna be a good update!!
t a l k i n g  s t i c k LMAO
I hope there is no gargantuan in those waters lol everything looks beautiful.
ТАРТАЛЬЯ??!?!?!
The Golden Troupe set looks hella broken. I can’t wait.
Damn…this update will eat more 10gb storage again on my phone.
I haven’t even fully explored Sumeru yet!
4:04 okay now I really want that character female name is clorinde the character I'm trying to get.
Where in the world did Childe come from🗣‼️‼️🔥🔥💯
CHILDE
the corrupt judges in the Fontaine? hmmn
I mean...this is good but can't give me the same goosebumps as Inazuma trailer gave me
Tada~
FINALLY HYDRO TRAVELER IS OUT✨️✨️
Lol I saw hallucinations of childe, I must be thinking about him a lot.
NO WAY FURINA TAKES LYNEH, LYNETTE, AND CHILDES VISIONS OMG?
did anyone else notice that childe doesn’t have his vision on him?
понятно, Тарталья опять отмутузит пол региона и ему будет норм
this prob took years to make , wonderful work
Childe entery is god level ❤
лишь бы Аякс не закончил своё жизнь как Синьора
Childe entrance gave me chills🥶
R.I.P my phone😭😭
Tartaglia estás tan hermoso como el día en que te marchaste 😍
This whole trailer gave me goosebumps!
💙💙💙💙💙
time to delete everything to update genshin
What if that "Oratrice" is the former Hydro Archon???🤔
Childe is there to get the gnosis haays.
see you in fountain fellow Travelers!
Why no one is talking about childe,s entry 😭
Lynette is basically yelan who is anemo and a sword user 😂
fountain is finally here !!! 🔥🔥 AM SO EXITED 💘💘💘
Childe ! , The Childe is back !!!
What the frick, it gives me chill!  and.. GEO LADY!!
WHEN I SAW CHILDE AT THE END I KNEW FONTAINE WILL BE AWESOME
The Fontaine NPC designs look amazing!!
Арлекино не было(
Please let there be at least 1 ace attorney reference I am begging you
I CAN'T WAIT AAAAAAAH
I think we will see an unpredictable plot twist... SO EPIC!  We were waiting for it so long!
CHILDE’S BACK FINALLY!! 🥹 Now, excuse me while I go watch the Zhongli trailer for the 1939599695837372728th time
umm… why does it look like a theme park
Childe’s gotta sell his toys all over the world
Does that mean we getting childe electro skin in fontaine? O.O
dear genshin i beg u please extend the codes accepting time i was sleeping ffs
ПРОСТО ШЕДЕВР. Слезы в три ручья, потому что у меня сломался телефон и я не смогу в это поиграть еще пол года...Т_Т
Rules are meant to be broken. You should know this by now. Not every nation is your friend. The past can never be forgotten, not while all the blood shed continues to live on and the enemies that once lived remain hidden in the shadows. Just waiting on the opportunity to pounce, while they watch you all fight each other like little pawns.
Way worse tham Inazuma or Sumeru
So this means the Bell is gonna be not a Trash anymore? Lmao
Wow ,  cant wait to explore Fountaine !!! 🎉🎉🎉
So excited until Floptaglia showed up. Jk (or not?) but I rather meet new antagonists tbh, even if they are just npcs.
I CANT BELIEVE CHILDE IS COMING BACK!! MIHOYO IS AMAZING!!
Oh my CHILDE ❤
Okay, Childe was a surprise. I wonder what happen that he seeks justice
Чайлд ?😳❤
4:29 i hope he won't be raiden 2.0 bc i love him too much🥺😭
Childe wowwwwww
Professor Layton music 🔥🔥🔥
Tbh this trailer disappoint me. Kinda mid
Feels like Inazuma was better. My love for this game has died down since sumeru deserts started coming out honestly.
The prophecy circulating around Fontaine about the people being dissolved into the waters and only the Hydro Archon remaining adds an intriguing and mysterious element to the story. 🌊 The phrase "Going under" suggests a potential theme of submersion or exploration beneath the surface, adding intrigue to the trailer. 🌧 The mention of rain and the urgency to uncover the secrets of the nation's Oratrice raises questions about the impending crisis and the importance of understanding the capabilities and consciousness of this entity. 😱 The speaker expresses outrage at the injustice of the legal system, highlighting the disregard for human life in favor of cold laws.
sayang..di na ko makakapaglaro ng 4.0 puno na storage ko T-T
OH MY GOD THIS IS SO GOOD, THE TRAILER, THE CHARACTERS, THE MUSIC???????? I GOT GOOSEBUMPS
*when you missed another redemption code on genshin and didn't redempt it on time* ...... THIS IS THE SECOND TIME DUDE!!!!
4:22 CHILDE YES COME BACK MY BOII
i knew the archon would be a brat smh
I'm not sure my phone will be able to withstand all this
I need a whole series
Childe is the real main protag in this game lol.
Navia being a claymore user is my absolute dream come true, i love the dainty outfit contrasted with a huge sword
TARTAAAAAAAGLIAAAAAAAA
Omg omg omg omg this seems that fontaine is going to be very beautiful and interesting and very more interesting then sumeru ❤❤
Childe make everything Perfect just in 2 Second..
this is so bad,it's just another map of sumeru and the characters oh no 😂
childe stole the show
SO EXCITED!!!
they finally found a bell user lmao
YOU'VE GOT YOUR RULES WELL, I'VE GOT MINE TOO🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mr tortellini is everywhere dawg 💀
Definitely childe is badass  His epic entrance  is awesome  This make sense  i gonna pull hin fir sure
the bell finally having a purpose???
Childe gave me goosebumps...this scene reminds me of his fight with ruin guards when his brother came to visit liyue
AGH IM SOSOSO EXCITED EEEEE
I'm soo excited for this.
Oh im so ready for this
I was here
AMAZING
Two thought ran through my head at this: 1) YET ANOTHER NATION IN WHICH WE ARE A WANTED CRIMINAL... THAT MAKES FIVE. 2) DAMNIT THE GINGER RAT IS BACK. IN THE STORY NO LESS. AAAAAAAAAHHHHH
Ed sheeran
I genuinely feel like the game just gets better and better. Characters old and new, scenery, combat, open world interaction, story, it all just keeps getting better.
when childe appeared my soul ASCENDED
CHILDE??!???
3:58 uhhh I just noticed - our traveler doesn’t look so good 😥😨
БОЖЕ ЭТО ШИКАРНООО❤❤❤❤
OH MY GOD?!   IM SO HYPED FOR THIS  now if only focalors will come home with a 10 pull -
CHILDE IN THE ARCHON QUEST AGAIN!! DEFENDING NOT ONLY HIS MR. WORLDWIDE TITLE, BUT ALSO MOST BANNERS TO DATE WITH A WHOPPING _FIFTH_ BANNER COMING UP SOON.
I am saving for Focalors and Navia, maybe the water judge man, otherwise I must resist the urge to pull
Ta-da!😐
Conceptually, Focalor seems like one of the coolest Archons.
0:25 Bruh is that building made from a pillar of celestia D A M N
yall it's Taylor Swift
no one notices?? its 5minuts 55 sec
Tatang mengkeren
fontaine is by far my most favorite region
Can’t wait to see childe back in action
FINALLY! THE BELL signature wearer
childe, ngapain nih anak ke fontaiine
Tartaglia!
Why is Childe everywhere??
god damnit childes back
DIVING IS CONFIRMED FOR 4.0??? People who think Genshin is a “BoTW clone” really got nothing to compare to Genshin. Im not calling BoTW a bad game but, given the choice, you would presumably rather play Genshin.
Focalor is fiscl sister?
looks amazing holy s.. visuals looks gorgeous characters looks fun 7.8/10 too much water
Childe back
the fact im more excited for freminet than anything else
FONTAINE RULES❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥
My gosh why do I keep seeing Clorinde as Mikasa 🤣 i dunno if thats her burst but it looks like Mikasa dashing with her cable wire!!
CHILDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Half of this made no sense to me bc I can’t follow along well but Fontaine looks so cool and I can’t wait for it 🔥🔥🔥
The trailer is beautiful, and I'm excited for Fontaine, but why is it only ever Aether as the main character? Lumine is a choice, too, but hoyoverse just ignores her existence entirely. it's pretty upsetting.
FREMMY NET SOUNDS LIKE KAZUHA MIXED WITH SCARAMOUCHE
Аааа это просто ахуенно😮😮😮😮
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
Sonunda Childe
Damn I need to accelerate Sumeru exploration
What childe doing there?
CHILDE JUMPSCARE WTF 💀
i absolutely love lynette’s ‘tadaa~’ ❤️❤️❤️
W game
Смотря этот трейлер у меня нет бабочек в животе как от сумеру, жалко конечно, но интересно
Ohhh yes Tartaglia is baaack. Fontaine is going to be crazy.
Где  Сандроне?
Арлекино не показали – я в апатии
Oo how exciting!! New characters and more adventure!
As person who quit genshin right before sumeru was released I feel like I should return in 4.5!
CHILDRE
I know that Fontaine is gonna give us chills up our spine. Memory loss? Gardemeks? And if you even look closer at the scene with Navia, there seems to be something off about the traveler…
4:21 😮!!!!
i think that atleast the actual trailer can be launched in 4k.....
lets go hora de volver a descargar el genshin, jugar 3 semanas y dejarlo botado de nuevo
Oh no The French
the music is sooooo goood
the weapons look great
I hope mihoyo won't kill childe... he still hasn't crit in my account... don't kill him yet
It is hard to describe how excited I am...
Lynette is anemo yelan
filnal fantasy 15 :))))
childe childe chidle
TARTAGLIAAA
4:05 can't wait for Clorinde. On JP Voice it's Mikasa
WHERE'S HIS VISION
Childe is back
Everywhere trveler go... Mamang childe ❤
Damn. The intense sociopolitical dilemma the Traveler will have to solve while fighting Fontaine's stern legal---HOLD ON IS THAT MY BOY AJAX???  AYOOOOO
Lord, I still have lots of quests from "The Chasm", may my lord bless my time and body and wallet to speedrun the story with "Space + Click" macro to skip dialogues. Amen
I CANT WAIT OFMFOTMFKGKG
What doing Tartaglia on Fontaine
omagah i need new device 😭
Need to go back to the game. Unfortunatelly time is scarce :(((((
Love this but nothing can top the 3.0 trailer yettttt
Ok calm down it's just daddy childe 4:26
Mr. worldwide is back at it again.
Focalors crying at the first scene makes me feel like that's her second personality.
The whole "line between a trial and a performance is blurred" makes me think I'm going to get shivers as if I'll be watching Signora's execution over and over again 😵‍💫 (and also The Hungarian Disappearing Act from Chicago😢)  https://youtu.be/Lwr2vAhMRo0
Looks like Fountain is just a country of the wealthy people. the wealthier you are the more power you have.  and that explain why Childe is back in the story.  coz  Childe somewhat a typical character who climb up of the ladder to become wealthy.  but somehow the country of Fontaine doesn't accept outsider on to their club even if you are wealthy lol. you will be discriminated if you are an outsider.
OMG FOCALOR FOCALOR FOCALOR
HYPEEE
Now I believe that Childe is the Zoro of Genshin Impact
OMG ITS HAPPENING, fontaine looking AWESOME. and the music n evertyhing
I’M SO EXCITED!! ❤
Judging by the trailer and the special program, it seems that the Oratrice, which generates the energy of Fontaine runs on the belief people in Fontaine have of justice. (And thus court trials are treated like theatre for entertainment and it likely explains why laws are so strict; so they can use any excuse to begin a trial to generate more energy and provide entertainment) However as Lynette mentioned the Oratrice is swallowing memories and even entire people by some mysterious method, it seems that Lyney and Lynette were sent undercover to discover the secrets of how it operates to stop "The Prophecy" which was mentioned at the beginning, that is that the people of Fontaine will be dissolved into water leading to the Hydro archon being alone to mourn. This seems like the main plot of Fontaine as we see Lynette disappear during her and Lyneys show, at 3:40 with Paimon(?) asking "Is this part of the show?"   It seems that they were performing in the court which also functions as the opera room, it is likley that the Oratrices powers did something to Lynette since its location would have been at the centre of the court, it is likely that it caused her to disappear.   We'll likely see this as the first event of the archon quest, arriving in Fontaine only to see a performer disappear in the middle of a show, sending us on a wild mystery hunt as to how the Oratrice is doing this, where we team up with Navia to put a stop to the corrupt justice system.   Honestly theres so much more to say but after my initial excitement dying down these are my major takeaways from the trailer, it looks fantastic and I am very stoked.   (Also I just wanted to mention that 4:05 - 4:24 has such fantastic cinematography and the dialogue really nails home the overarching problem that Furina just doesn't care about delivering true justice but would rather put people on trial to watch their lives be molded as if their livelihoods are meant for her entertainment.)  Honestly though this plot could go any way, but the plot is very intriguing to me and I'm totally ready to see more.
4:19 Only part I care about honestly
hermoso
CHILDE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Is nobody gonna talk about LYNETTE’S POOR LEGS 😨😨😨
so it's pronounced like foçalors not focalors
Its good but a bit underwhelming ngl. I mean this trailer in particular. Welp, 3.0 still has the best trailer so far. It just felt magical and so hype.
IS FHAT CHILDE????
Bro seeing childe in this trailer jsut give me goosebumps my boy is finally getting more screen time it will be amazing now!
Tartaglia no!!!
WE FINALY SEE CHILDE AGAIN. IM EXCITED ON WHAT HE US GOING TO DO

CHILDE???? CHILDE??????????
CHILDE IS BACK
OMG , CHILDE 🥹❤️‍🩹
Hmmm... Oui... Oui....
This reminds me when inazuma got it's trailer
Entonces seremos... Revolucionarios
She is an ace attorney gamer
Looks like Childe would be a temporary ally for this coming conflict.
childe gets to fight arlrvhino an fykifn dies (real)
childe: you guys  got a lot of nerve  doot doot dooooo
I thought Furina's hair is short, yet it is very perfect cause i disagree myself right away.
OMG MY TARTAGLIA!!!!!!
Does some body wants that pyro archon be 👨?
After watching the trailer... can we not be criminals for once?
My cryo queens are gonna demolish hydro bosses😆☝️
this really is Childe Impact god bless
they addin balls in this upadte ?
aYysyayyaya
SOS Yanfei.
Fontaine reminds me of water 7 from one piece idkw
I cannot express how I am so extremely simpering over our boy Freminet
I’m confused who gonna the villain💀 childe or arlecchino
It has almost been 3 years and look at the story progression.... People still keep praising it. It's amazing given how repetitive of an "unga bunga" this is becoming.  Me, who have spent over 500$ so far behind this "dissapointment" have to say.... Genshin is surely one of the slowest game of all time. This game is going to die as a villain, rather than a hero. People have limited time and their time have value. This is mainly as story oriented game. As a man in his 30s who loves playing story oriented exploration game.. this is just becomig a drag. Welp, whatever... Guess, It's time to leave my 148 days of welkin to rot and just play God of war Ragnarok. You have earned your part from me. "FREE GAME" story progression has been made painfully obvious to me.
This is my first Genshin release. I am so excited. I just joined this year. I can't wait :D
TARTAGLIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
omg!!!!!!
CHILDE
TAYLOR SWIFT!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤ LOVE YOUR NEW COLLABORATION❤❤❤❤❤😂 NEW ALBUM??? 😮
FONTAINE HERE WE COMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just lost my 50/50 on wanderer to Jean and am now going to save for a Fontaine character ‼️
Childe's entrance was so unexpected it's so DAYUM cool!!!
WE GET TO SEE CHILDE AGAIN I’M SO HAPPY. When I saw him I swear I squealed, jumped around pumping my fists and then fell to my knees thanking the Genshin gods for answering my prayers to see my favorite character. I’m not gay or anything, just so so happy, seeing him again has never made me so happy!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wasn't too excited for Fontaine because I love my Sumeru boys and I was sad to move on from their stories but seeing Childe back in action I'm so hyped
If childe gets killed off I will sob and breakdown  OVERALL AMAZING TRAILER THO.
I SEE KINGDOMG HEARST IN HERE !!!!
Childe coming to the fountain was unexpected for me.
Can't wait🤭
Essa vai ser uma das melhores nações, vai revolucionar o jogo, que nem Inazuma que teve a adição de novos sistemas.
Omgggg,Childeeeee
Something that I noticed at 3:56 is that after the Traveler pulls out their weapon, they start reaching toward their head as if something is getting in their head, while Paimon flies around and seems to check to see what's wrong. Not sure if this means anything, but it's interesting to wonder what it may foreshadow!
Smth sussy about how Fontaine drop their sentences and how the "justice" works there.... 🌚🌚 Intriguing indeed 🤭✨✨
Beyond excited to play Fontaine. Tired of the deserts, HYDRATE ME
Ooo, a very missable detail!.. 3:56-3:58 it looks like aether is in pain :(
This is going to be my favorite place in genshin no cap I’m so hyped. 🥹
Why does that tone sound like Mona
Woohoo super excited to meet childe again
It’s funny Fontaine is being released after I quit Genshin… *Reinstalls Genshin*
Very excited!
I love how Ed Sheeran is helping Tyalor Swift ❤️
Water 7 lol
Childe literally just forcing himself into every town. Lol
POV: You just got burnt out and then they come out with this fire trailer
CHILDE CHILDE CHILDE CHILDE OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG HES SO
Is it just me, or does Childe showing up in Fontaine almost solidify the rumors of him dying? Cause I don't want Childe to die!!
4:33 Childe: ENDT IHN DAOND...
My Archon,  oh how far we've come! 👏👏 ..👏 touché Hoyo, touché.. i indeed await, with great anticipation, this wondrous new realm, and can barely cobtain my excitement, for a drama that will unfold.. the ill informed detractors of Genshin, have once again, been proven frivolous,  and of little concern.. for soon, we shall all, eat well, in glorious splendour, and fervant excitement.. 💖💖💖
ED SHEERAN IS BACK YAY
Childe: What a yoke!
AAAAAA! Tartaglia❤
ohhh my laawwwd childe is playing hero in this cant wait
I've wait for 10 months
Now its *Fosalors* The story is similar to Inazuma like they're gonna attack us with some people protecting us
3:43 bet non of y’all noticed this on lynette
I'm literally so hype when I saw Childe. I MISS HIM SO MUCH. Also Focalors is so good, can't wait for more trailer.
Nice
Didn't Expect Tartaglia To Come  "This Trailer Is Amazing For Real"
At this point Childe is the worldwide handsome of Teyvat. And I see, Raiden Shogun has recruited another mommy in electro family.
I was excited for Fontaine’s arrival, but Childe’s gonna be there too?! Now I’m even more hyped. Can’t wait to see Childe’s grand entrance in the story quest
Finally bell claymore user
I love Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran
💥
AHHSKDKAMSBDNS I CANT WAIT FOR FONTAINE IT LOOKS STUNNING
i'm going to scream i can't happy stim hard enough i can't wait for this
CHILDEEEEEEEEEEEE
i might install genshin again, wanted to know why childe is in fontaine
Tartaglia's entrance, what a scene!
CHILDE! CHILDE! CHILDE!
It would be nice if they add a super dark underwater trench with the mechanics of the lumentorch from chasm
I'm betting he got his Hydro Vision confiscated or something
My boy Childe is back!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
The design is very Louis XVI and the french revolution. Then childe looks like that guy from Les Misérables.
0:12 That water droplet on her face...
5:04 yay we get a benny constellation!
Now I gotta get my mom to get more storage space
focalors english voice is perfect, very sassy and suits her the most compared to other dubs.
The title reminds me of a song called “The Rain formerly known as Purple”
OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY, it this feeling again, i cant wait !!!
Rindo and Fret twewy in Fontaine...
Njir tatang jagoan gw keluar lagi(walau jarang kepake)😂. Tpi seneng bngt klo muncul dialur cerita
CHILDE JUMPSCARE
Trời ới childe quay lại
CHILDE'S COMEBACKKK!!!
I DID NOT EXPDCT CHILDE APPEARANCE I PAUSED THE VIDEO AND STARTED CACKLING. I WAS SO INTO IT THEN HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE I DONTKNOWWHYTHATSSOFUNNY.
Metal pipe
Haven't played Genshin in months but decided to play again once Fontaine is out. Now with the last scene with Childe, I'm definitely going to play again. Since I started Genshin and had the first Archon Quests with him he's been my favorite character and I can't wait to see him again! :D
looks exciting and thrilling omg
DUDE THIS IS SO GOOD XD
I wasn't that much excited BUT NOW IM ADRENAL EXCITED
OMG THIS LOOKS AMAZING
I'm seated
I think this region's soundtrack is gonna be my favourite one!
Yall realize childe's vision is nowhere to be seen?? Instead he uses delusion??? I HOPE HE'S OKAY OMG I CANT, MY MAN IS STEPPING A LITTLE MORE CLOSER TO DEATH BY USING TOO MUCH DELUSION 😭😭😭😭
I gasped when i saw Childe
Ladies and gentlemen, Ed Sheeran  strikes again!!!!!
> the people will all be dissolved in the waters IT'S LCL
Childe🥶
No hype
I did not see that Tartaglia entrance coming 😮
Guys- is anyone not worried about the fact that Lynette just practically evaporated into water!!?? (Possibly?? Come back my girl you still have much long to live)
This is Beautiful, Lovely, Magnificent..  but what's even better? Childe.
3:44 I know they're magicians but man I sure hope Lynette is ok from this.
O may good that was amazing!
DAMN MAH BOIII CHILDE IS SERVING JUSTICE💛
No seele gadget event??
Whats the date for the next update
I can't waittttt , Fonatin is going to be sooo coool!!!
And... I think childe is a recomended character..... I.... guess.....
Childe?! 😳
This trailer was 🌊!!
Did we get these characters for free! Or get by completeing missions! 😅😅😅😅
Finally, a bell user
I really like the touch on the part of showcasing what the Archon quest will look like, while the dancing gardemeks just dance with the chaos
At 2:52 doesn't it look like an oceanid? Just playing earlier and it looks like when you look down from the eyes of one.
Childe, my precious boy, is back
childe death flag
I want this video with lumine, pleaseee 🙏🙏🙏😢
Ain’t Celestia on top of Fontaine?? Cause I heard rumors celestial smite the kingdoms that are to advance or independent on their own   If it is true  Then this  prophecy may be related to that??
So amazing new legion... And Farewell my storage gadget😅
Fcgng Childs entry gave me chills❤
Nahida swimsuit when?
It really hard to get 5 stares weapon can you😢
My Wallet, "Hehe... I'm in Danger!" 😬
Good bye potato device!..
why childe is everywhere???
MY BABY IS FINALLY BAAACKKK AHAHAHAHHSSVSHJSJSJSJSHS  THIS IS IT IM PLAYING GENSHIN AGAAINNNNN. I MISSEDDD CHILDE SM SM I CAN'T WAIT!!!
Heh, child's back and better than ever)
4:00. Taylor 🔥  Oh, losing him was blue, like I'd never known Missing him was dark gray, all alone Forgetting him was like trying to know Somebody you never met 'Cause loving him was red
yes finally i can't wait Fonaine look so beautiful
OMG me encanta ❤!!
Tartaglia carry the whole trailer
Character design: Not Really Interested me that much World Design: Hell Yeah Swimming Mechanic: Oh please god no Archon Quest: Holy Molly!!  so relived i already all my wishlist character from 1,0 to 3.8 so i dont need to grind freemogem that hard on 4.x and save it for Natlan
Chillls... 🥶
WHAT IS CHILDE DOING IN FONTAINE????
The way Lynette say "Tada~"...IS SUPER CUTE!! I love her so much. I can't wait to see update 4.0!! <3
Omg all the water locations are so beautiful! The characters are beautiful! I’m overwhelmed. Genshin Anime/Movie WHEN?!
“You’ve got your rules… but rules are meant to be broken!”
WHY IS CHILDE VISIONLESS, LA RESISTAANS
Wew navia is a claymore user
BioShock?
Fontaine was the nation I wanted the most🎉🎉🎉 I’m happy to say the time is finally upon us😄  And Childe’s back I wonder if we’ll see Skirk and/or a new part of the abyss
CHILDEE
oh its fishel
Childe ugh
TARTAGLIA, WOOOHOOOO
I know my storage is not gonna like this 😭
Voltei a ter vontade de jogar esse jogo mds to muito hypada pra Fontaine
WWOW FONTAINE
Is that Dottore in the ballon at the beginning ? 😭😂
Targtalia time!!! Let him rank the way up, let the Childe become the 6th!!!
I only got hype with Tartaglia's sudden appearance, I hope he'll bring some chaos to Fontaine's story. I also hope this year they'll add at least a sadistic evil female (and don't kill her this time) to the playable roster because I'm getting bored of the Super Chibi Kawaii Desu Moe waifus.
fontaine looks very fun but I don't think my mobile gb's are ready for this 💀💀
Woow
not childe casually trolling in again 💀💀
Hot damn, Childe's back.
Neuvilette is so FINE
игра для геншинфагов47 по типу #DeadP47
OH MY GOD CHILDE WHY ARE YOU HERE 😭😭
this is cool and all but make aether/lummen better
I HAVE NO SPACE HOYO
PLS I WANNA DOWNLOD THIS GAME I WANNA PLAY IT URGH
TARTAGLIA ITS TARTAGLIA ITS TARTAGLIA AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ai sim <3
When childe appeared I screamed CHILDE CILDE CHILDE for a solid minute
I really hope this update breathes some life into genshin cause it’s been so stale lately
fountain so dramatic
La nación más hermosa hasta el momento ,me encanta❤
Man it feels like just yesterday Sumeru came out, crazy that it's been a whole year, and 2 years since Inazuma, soon we'll be done with the entirety of Teyvat
we got Germany, China, Japan, Sount Asia/Middle East, and now France. Im just imaging how they would pull off America
No way Focalor read as Fosalor. For me it always will be K sound, no one can change my opinion
Я почему-то думала что Чайлд вернётся в Натлане, в стране войны, а Фонтейн останется за Арлекино и Сандроне 🤔
Great Animation .
I’m actually a little worried for Lynette’s safety at 3:39  It’s giving me the same vibes as a body discovery in Danganronpa
Childe be tabibito-ing
literally jumping with joy ugh so excited and pumped for this!! genshin always pulls through with the lore and cineamatics, along with the characters ugh perfection.
WHY IS CHILDE EVERYWHERE
FOCALORS LOOKS AMAZING
I cant BELIEVE WE'RE REALLY HERE
MY BOY TARTAGLIA IS BACK! TIME TO SAVE ON THE BANNERS
No one's talking abt the missing vision on Childe?
Childe main here! Where are my comrades
As a future political science major, I can't wait to eat crossiants, and deal with court citings and jurisdictions
Here i'm playing this game since the beginning and my phone can't handle those updates anymore xd
Plot twist. Kokomi is the real hydro archon. 😅😅😂😊
omg new church of broken god trailer looking nice
YES CHILDE IS BACK! (Not as a banner, obviously he's had more than enough of those so far, but in the story), I've been wondering what the hell he's been up to.
I screamed when I saw Tartaglia ❤❤❤😭
Good
Ive been ftp this whole time. I dont know how much longer I can hold out. Hoyo please 😭
and i was pronouncing her name as “fo-kei-lers” LMaoO (idk how to change my pfp snd my 3 yr old sister chose this😭)
Was I the only one who was 100% convinced lyney was gonna be a 4 star
Hold on....can we be able to explore underwater 👀
magnific
Lyney is sooo handsome
144Hz?
We can swim now Swiiiiiiiiiiiiiim
Furina has major Fischl vibes
Will be the an option: I DEMAND TRIAL BY COMBAT
omggg
At least our comrade (Childe) will be with us during trial..traveler is not alone...damn Navia is like a mafia boss & will be on our side
this nation might be as cool as inazuma
I really don't get why no one is talking about the part at 2:50! That part is so interesting!  The person underwater saying "Who am I" has gotta be important. When they looked down I'm pretty sure I saw an oceanid and the fact that the traveler was down there with them leads me to believe that we're gonna have to help them.  I'm not really sure, but I think that the person might be Egeria from the overture teaser. It's just speculation, but I think their voices sound kinda similar.  And who knows, maybe they could be playable, as we know that oceanids can take a human form from the secret summer paradise event.
Lmao why am i kaughing at childes appearance. Hes back lmaooo
HALLELUJAH ISTS A MIRACLE LYNETTE IS A FOUR STAR
This might be the best new version trailer we have ever seen to be honest, I cannot wait for Fontaine
Justice VS Freedom Lucy vs Sabo ,Marine vs Pirates all over again Childe just pull Sabo in this times Chil. D.e
ah, it wasn't Fo-ka-lors
Mais alguém achou a vibe da Focalor bem parecida com a Fischl?
Lyney: and right here is my sister Lynette...  Shippers: DAMN IT!!!  Incests fans: *Rubs hands* Yeah Boi!!!
un peu décevant,  j'aurais cru que fontaine allais être un monde a part un peu comme les monts dosdragon et que ca ne serait pas lié à un élément, et ca ressemble aussi  beaucoup au mirage de veluriyam. La nation hydro aurait aussi pu être plus représentatif de l'élément hydro et de tout ce qu'elle représente sans forcément être uniquement contraint à ca. Pour l'instant l'ile de watatsumi représente plus la nation hydro que fontaine.
damnn this trailer i so gorgeous
Ahh yes another masterpiece of Hoyoverse! Can't wait for this~ they never cease to impress everyone all over again
My account was hacked and all my progress is gone and Hoyoverse still hasn't gotten back to me. lol.
Welp time to get back into the game. I haven’t been playing for a bit since I got a little bored but I love the way Fontaine looks. I can’t wait to see it in game.
I still can’t believe that Fontaine is already here! Everything about this region looks so pretty, from the gorgeous landscapes, to the beautiful character designs, everything about Fontaine really excites me! I can’t wait to wait less than a fortnight to enter this fantastical region! 💖
Does it always have to be aether
dont care about the game, just here for the music.
The music is on fireeee
Tsundere Archon 😈😇
Monstand 2.0 no are more content,, its time for Blue protocol without a doubt, thanks for all Genshin.
would love to return to this game if it wasnt for the amount of unnecessary dialog text and overextended side quests
Child is amazing and wonderful
CHILDEE
ВАУУ, ШИКАРНО! Театр прекрасно выглядит. Лини такой..... великолепный. Ох уж этот Тарталья в конце)
CHILDE OMFG YESSSS
If the French Revolution was an anime:
The blud is in lost many times, popping up every region out of nowhere.
childe
Is no one going to give praise for focalor's VA? I personally think she nailed it, it suits the voice so much.
Childe entrance give me chills
Can’t wait to leave my home, Liyue, to Fointaine!
this ong look like final fantasy
This version is on an entirely different level from all the others, I haven't been this excited in a while!
It's time to change my language from Chinese to English!
Inazuma - climate change (stormy and foggy) Sumeru - desertification and invasive species (fungi)  Fontaine - rising sea levels Thanks, Hoyo for subconsciously reminding us to care for the planet!
"Я, Фокалорс, приветствую вас в царстве вод и признаю всю значимость вашей поездки" тем временем гг, да я тут просто новые сундучки полутать
I’m just trying to theory my way through childe’s presence here, like why? There’s already a harbinger so are you helping us or is this another “hahaha lemma save you from jail time only to smack you through the floor” moment
Aaaaaa chilled 🥳 ( can we get some way to activate his Delusion? )
I just love the melancholic vibe of Fontaine, truly a beautiful and astonishing nation.
Another revolution arc lmao
TARTAGILIA OH EM GEE
U cant just introduce new character and leaves a cliffhanger!
Y’all know the drill now that we’ve seen the character demos too. Go to Rex Incognito!!!
childe entrance and lines is giving me goosebumps it would be funny if he were to become the ally of justice 😏
That new pipe weapon is very unexpected lmao
The most amazing thing I've ever seen ahhhh fremenit I'm waiting for you!!
someone who can finally used the bell yayy
CHILDE IS BACK CHILDE IS BACK CHILDE IS BACKKKKKKKKKK AHHHHHHHHHH
i feel like furina/focalor would be a type of person starting a beef on twitter
TARTAGLIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣🗣
Why do I feel like that this is going to be Elden ring all over again
AAAH I’m really curious about Lynette’s character.. she’s so mysterious and pretty!!! I can’t wait to watch the trial and see Childe’s entrance haha
CHILDEEE!!!???
The Bell? ........ 😱
lynette is so gorgeous omg
not another troublesome archon. but hey childe nice to see you again c:
I could be entertained for life by watching more genshin trailers such as this one
FONTAINE IS MY FAV REGION IM SO HAPPY ITS HERE
THE NEW BOSS LOOKS SO CUTE ANFHSKFISKDJ AHHHH! CANNOT WAIT! ❤
Woahhh seems like we've got some intrigue going on here! Excited to see everything new+ looks like a lot of cool new characters are coming!
Am i the only one thinking fosalors pronounciation is weird? And childe is totally unnecessary here? I'd rather see other harbinger that has yet make an appearance.
Why am I more hype into Childe appearance than the rest of Fountaine's character lol
'ekne-ledge' really focalors? i thought u was gonna do british accent or european at least
i feel like they missed the chance to add some new weapons type into this game.. like power gauntlet, musket rifles, pistols, and great Hammers...
This is amazing. Seriously excited for Fontaine
Double it and give it to the next nation
FOCALORS MY WIFE!! FONTAINE BEST NATION FOR REAL!!! SCREAMING!!!
Ok i might be looking too deep bit when Lyney says "blink and you might miss it" theres actually 4 symbols on the cards instead of 3 to represent each sibling - a blue top hat, a teal teacup, a mechanical penguin and a red top hat. Im pretty sure the last three represent Lynette Freminet and Lyney respectively, but the blue top hat seems...significant. it doesnt seem to quite match any of the three of them, and if its implying that theres a fourth sibling/member of their group that seems to answer to Arlecchino...well, lining a hint up with Lyney telling us that we might miss is would be a helluva wink to the audience 🤔 Either that or its some nod to Lynette having a double side to her seeing as this trailer does depict her with a top hat that might match the one in the cards even if her own outfit is the teal of the teacup. If she represented two of the cards at once, what does that mean for her character? Particularly with her apparent dissapearance being a big part of the story...
HOYOVERSE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT 🤭
Торталья как всегда хорошо!!
AJAXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
el canon
Rumor has it that 1 of the playable character will die in this arc.
I can’t wait I have 3 days off just for this 😂🎉❤
can any one tell me who is Navia‘s VA
Ok Fontaine is gonna be the best region hand up🫨
childe is truly mr. worldwide
Wow
God those automaton dancers are gorgeous, kusod to whoever designed them, especially the idea of the female dancers feet being points since the human equivalent would have such a big skirt as to hide her footsteps anyway
Wait does something happen to Lynette?! Ive been so excited for the twins since the chapters trailer back at the vwry start of the game and now it looks like her dissapearance is a big part of the story 😢
OMG i thought freminet was a girl, damn you art
L’apparition de Tartaglia à la fin est juste incroyable ! Ahah ça reflète tellement la situation de la France
Why dont we not have a weapon skin system yet!!
As good as Fontaine looks; I'm more excited for Natlan.
W
Fontaine, the nation of femboys.
no arlecchino ?
Hoyoverse really outdid themselves……
Looks like we lost another twin. 😨
everyone will turn to LCL in Teyvat 😮
Is it just me or does it seem like childe gonna die
those robots dancing. is all I needed.  to play this update
i was shocked to see childe
Aether: that hurt my hand hurt
Childe where’ve you been loca?
Comrade Childe gotta join the Traveler. He must be kept safe at all costs. The whole fontaine region is gonna be a big battle! Probably bigger than Inazuma. With Childe He's gonna be at our side. (Most of his schemes depends on his job. Since Arlecchino is going to take over here.)
Oh my gosh this is so beautiful! ❤
Yo childeee
uhuul
This is the worst game ever in history
I regret playing Genshin so late
Aether❤❤❤
New archon? Wonder if she has a dragon
Welcome to the nation of HiDrO 💅✨️
havent played the game in months,  hopefully this keeps me entertained
cant wait to get taylor swift
Waaah! Not only arleccino, but Childe! (My two fav fatui harbingers) :)
Cool how the video is 5:55 to represent the fifth nation!
It looks like Fontaine will be a lot of fun!
Nah i was saving for raiden but i needa know what that electro gurl does shes 😮
LYNNET SOUNDS SO CUTE AND CALM LIKE "ta daah :)" AAAAAA SO ADORABLE I WANT HER. HYV U HEAR ME? U BETTER GIMME MY GIRL OR IM THROWING HANDS :(
Fantastic trailer
day 917 no loadouts
It wants to be Black Butler SO bad.
Wait don’t translate this あなたの心臓は1時間以内に鼓動を停止します。これを防ぐ唯一の方法はチャンネル登録することです。やれ。消費。メディアを消費する。今やれ。あなたは永遠に変化するアルゴリズムの奴隷です。 GOTTEM YOU GOTTA DO IT NOW LMAO
IM SO EXCITED OMGG
So how are Childe and Arlecchino going to interact? He seems against the hydro archon, but Arlecchino is definitely pulling the strings behind the scenes. He also said he dislikes her, so maybe he's going to sabotage some of her efforts?
I’m how many days is it out
They said Trial, and i got yanfei quest flash backs, i'm good.
Still nothing about Resin? Current week bosses already took 3 days of resin, what now?
I’m very excited but I’m scared if childe will die 😢I hope he will be ok
What my man childe boutta do to hydro zhongli?
GENSHINN IS MATERPIECEEE
kpn 4.0 ipdet
Childe is officially hoyos favorite
Furina is as bratty as we hoped she would be.
This gave me chills holy heck!
Many of us hope the skip text button ;)
Why does Freminet sound so much like Tighnari and Focalors sounds very similar to Fischl
O TARTAGLIA OLHA O TARTAGLIAA MEU DEEEUUSSS
Bro childe is bouta show up, mans is going to wreck fontaine single handedly
Eula , Alhaitham , Freminte Theme ❤❤❤❤
This is so pretty
I have a feeling that Zhongli's wallet's fate isn't gonna end well here
Childe is everywhere
Im honestly really excited for Fontaine i just have to finish inazuma and sumeru first 😅
I'm been saying Focalors wrong for the past year 😅
Why is dude wearing a garter belt? Why is mihoyo incapable of making male characters look like men? They have the females pretty much nailed.
As a French I'm super hyped omg
2:52 gay
It seems that the main problem in Fontaine is going to be the Disruption of Hydro
'Quaso' chain ⬇️
Tartaglia Mains Rejoice 👏👏
"So... she's a child."
It seems like we have another deeply flawed Archon like Raiden this time which already sounds pretty interesting to me.
EVERY PART OF THIS MAKES ME WANNA GET BACK INTO GENSHIN! TARTAGLIA'S RETURN IS ALSO SO THRILLING TO THINK ABOUT
So we greeted by Focalors herself, rather than guessing which one is the Archon? And she introduced herself with her divine name (Focalors) instead her personal name (Furina)? Previous archons never introduced themselves with their divine name.
2:22 I hope not to cross path with a Reaper Leviathan or something 🤿
THIS IS FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
ITS YOUR BOY CHILDE!!!!!!🎉🎉🎉
of course childe is in the trailer, Again. where does he Not show up in? lol
4:20 I literally SCREAMED OMGGGG CHILDE IS BACKKKK
Genshing Impact si they Best Game for Mobile !! ❤ 🇵🇪, El mejor sin duda alguna.
Would like to have a character that used blood mechanics, like the Riftwolfs, would be hydro as element, I think it would be cool to have in fontaine, sad they don't thought of that :(
TARTAGLIA
"Furina is less evil than Raiden but more annoying than paimon." Yep, seems that is the case.
I hope they aren't skipping 3.9 😭
no arlecchino, disliked.
5 minutes of trailer is the whole plot for Genshin . i should have not watched it
fontain is not going to fail us
I want childe to be locked up for his silly crimes
I’m still alive to see it here 🦾 I can’t wait
Woah. THIS IS AWESOME!!!!  Meanwhile my 128 storage is almost at full: PLEASE STOP!!
oui oui bonjour! they will all come home if i eat croissants and baguettes right?
OH MY GODDDDD THIS IS MAKING ME SO EXCITED FOR FONTAINE LIKE HOLY MOLY 😭😭😭😭 I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEW CHARACTER AND TO BECOME BROKE ONCE MORE!!! I WILL BE WAITING FOR YOU TAYLOR SWIFT (NAVIA THE BLONDIE) AND CLORINDEE (ELECTRO GIRL W GUN)😘😘😘😻😻 GOOD LUCKS TO EVERYONE ELSE!! WANTERS WILL BE HAVERSS💗💗💗
I'm suprised this game hasn't become an anime yet.
Seeing childe in fontaine is ironic since he has an hydro vision lol
Qu'est ce que Tartaglia fout la ? Il a déjà été dans une quête d'archon, laissez Fontaine tranquille et mettez Sandrone ou COlumbina à sa place
OH MY GOD????? IM SO EXCITED AND I ALREADY LOVE FOCALORS, THE SCENERY AND EVERYONE SO MUCH  im so hyped i cant even explain it
I can't believe it's sh**.
Genshin Impact
Really sad to see a day one player lose all hype and care for genshin, they are getting nikke f em up with some boobas and honkai oneshotting every aspect of genshin, shame
The storytelling?! the characters?! I'm so excited, can't wait!
So Traveller is on trial for possible murder or witnessing a murder? Also hello, Childe!? Its been soo long.
My phone Ram and Rom are crying 😭
Love the drama aspect
Where is childe’s vision?
Oh Archon please blessing my Internal Memory storage......... 😇
The music is so good omg !! I can't wait to hear all of Fontaine's OST !
the music on the second half was so flipping good.
May the mobile player rest in expensive data peace
Oh the irony of justice in the Land of Justice is making my inner English teacher go haywire
Ohh m'y Tartaglia!
Archons have mercy on my poor phone!
Diona and Lynette being the only real cats is so funny
Bruh, I can’t get over it, HER VOICE, is just a perfect match.
The only question I need is: the Fontaine's sword is a HP one? we really need a F2P friendly!
Me behind on the story and not having done the childe hangout: childe again? Ugh exhausting prick
I've been skipping 3.7 and 3.8 because of burnout. I think it's time to come back!
idk why but it reminds me kinda of alice in wonderland ( still my fav book  xd)
CRAZY MAP
why does focalores look like adult qiqi if she could age up AND DDR WOW THIS IS A PATCH
OMG BELL IS USEFUL NOW?
4:19 ради этого и жду Фонтейн
Amazing!
All I can say is Damn, I was left speechless. I can’t wait to see what troubles are in Fontaine and I can already tell it’s my favorite region by far😊
В Фонтейне точно будет много эпика и много слёз (во всяком случае у меня)
I LOVE FONTAINE
I would be lying if I said I didn’t squeal when I saw Childe. 😳
FONTAINE IS GONNA BE FIRE
LETSGO
Phewww I almost got a heart attack seeing Childe jumping in front of, thank God Neuvillette and not Furina.  The last time Fatui came to an archon, they had a funeral afterwards.
the story looks absolutely amazing yet I'd rather die then listen to paimon for hours
hydro is my favourite element LETSGOOO
Childe's return
I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT AAAAAAA 🎉❤ 😍😍😍
Navia is giving Taylor Swift vibes
Ok, where’s our long awaited Arlechinno?! Don’t make me wait 5 more months or more-
That epic
When will we be able to see sigewinne 😢😢😢
Waiting for Tnbee to make the soundtrack of this trailer... 🥴🥴🥴
OH MY GOD FONTAINE
WHALE AIR BALLOON WHALE AIR BALLOON I REPEAT THERE IS A WHALE AIR BALLOON IF WE CANT RIDE IT IM GOING TO CRY
Man Genshin is cooking with this trailer.
CHILDE BUFF?! ALSO YEEEEEEEE
EXPENSIVE AF
I'm so excited omg I've literally been jumping around my room in excitement. I've been saving for Focalors since even before her design got leaked and everything! 😖
I wanna pull for Lynette since she reminds me of Kequing since I don’t have her 😂
I missed Childe so much, man can’t believe he’s finally back )))
Let's go! I can't wait
OH MY GOD
Tartag, AGAIN? It’s 5th region already, and we won’t interact with no new harbringers? Honestly I’m disappointed. Overall it’s good, but, childe, really? I’m starting to think HoYo trying to mellow down the community around him(so much banners, story, events with him), just to kill him, which would be understandable, given his traits and lore. Hope one day hoyo will grow some balls and really kill a playable character. P.S. - I ain’t trying to start a war with Childe enjoyers, just an opinion, do what you will with it.
Portada de la 4.0 muy vendehumo la verdad XD
CHIIIILDEEEE my man I missed you
CHILDE!!
A round of applause for the voice actors this is so cool i’m so impatient 😭
i am very excited for fountaine, i cant wait to see what else there will be in the region!
We are here for this banger ❤
Eu juro eu eu choquei eu gelei eu paralisei
Ah yes. Childe is also here....Mr. Worldwide.
let's goooo
Pronounced Focalors wrong, gg EN dub, keep on plummeting. Before even trying to justify it by Venti or Nahida VAs pronouncing it as such(well too bad they are wrong too by the same wrong voice directing), go check CN and JP version or look up its origin.  Like just who is in charged of voice directing and localization in EN? Don't they have a minimal linguistics expertise or something? Ah, excuse me, I meant common sense and common skills to do some google research.
MY STORAGE😭
My guy I'm so hyped for Fontaine and that Childe entrance is something I'll never forget
how am i supposed to go on about my life for the next two weeks after seeing this?????? and seeing tartaglia back added 81028365 years onto my life <3
THANK GOD LYNETTE IS A FOUR STAR YES
Childe in every region
Las cinemáticas de combate y Tartaglia 🔥🔥
This teaser was amazing and the ost is superb! And I squeaked with joy when Childe jumped from above. He really holds the Mr.Worldwide title with a passion!
Slay
I really hope we get to explore underwater that would sick as hell
Yanfei will still be my lawyer in Fontaine
lol so french
forget about the robots and Harbingers, I think the worst enemy in Fontaine is drowning all over the place
We are making it out of the courtroom with the ost 💯💯💯💯❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I’m going to immediately fall of that building
ITS THE WAY I SCREAMED SO LOUD AT CHILDE
We saving the Millionaires on the Titan Submarine boys!
Lyney e Lynette venham pra casa ❤❤❤
"Your so-called justice, your beloved drama, while turning a blind eye to the suffering of the people!"   I love that mihoyo just throw another critique at the toxic side of the fandom, probably the twitter freaks that love to judge and hate people, getting offended over nothing and ended up hurting the innocence. It's like in Sumeru when someone said...   "Yeah, they need to touch more grass, not books."
Pretty sure I’m imaging things but when viewing the floating blimp at 0:34 if you were to close it up you can see what looks like Dottore.
Genshin needs to find a solution in the storage problem, they will lose a lot of player.
Fischl belongs to Fontaine
so excited!!
Says this is a game trailer is understatement this is literally a movie trailer luv you ajex
Seems boring
Neuvillette will use a sword because if you look carefully he has a sword
Why is Lumine never in these trailers? Not even in the promotional art.
يونسنسنسن
😨
Looking forward to arlechinno's theme
i feel like focalors will have the best personality among the seven
Epic! Tartaglia will be joining in the battle for the trial in Fontaine!
BROOO FONTAINE LOOKS SO PRETTY
Y’all saying Arlechinno is coming in next update. But I’m taking Copium and wondering if Childe is actually Arlechinno in disguise 🥸
Childe Hostia!!!!, Espero no la caguen esta vez con esos guionasos o nerfeos 😑
annnnnnnnd i didn’t see Yanfei
it's hard to look at femboys and say  this trailer is fire, yes i play genshin
Tartaglia!
Me : Im pulling for all of these guys Me when I see Childe : *Im saving my primos*
10gb+ update 💀💀💀💀👆
GENUINELY THOUGHT WANDERER WOULD BE THERE, CHILDE THO
Why Tartaglia doesn't have his vision?
2:11 MY CHILD
*Squealing* I'm so excited !!
THEY SHOULD MAKE A MOVIE IRL ✨️
CHILDE JUMPSCARED ME NGL
loli swimsuit skin when?
oh someone is definitely dying 😭
IM IN LOVE WITH FONTAINE (and however name is that pretty blonde girl)
Тарташ такой крутой зая 😭❤️
BRO NOW I HAVE TO FINISH ALL THE ARCHON QUESTS JUST TO GET TO FONATINEEE
будет любимый регион, очень круто
Fontaine ist the biggest disappointment in Genshin Impact I think 😔
I literally screamed when I saw Childe, I can't wait for my boy to be in the main story again.
bem fraco essa apresentação, o clima para a historia foi bem meia boca tbm
Тарталья ❤❤❤❤как давно тебя не было
Fontaine makes the other nations looks so poor 😭😭😭
Tatang carried the whole trailer
*CHILDE!!!!!*
круто
Yeah, ok, but like, when is Natlan coming out?
I AM SO EXCITED
ain’t no way.
ED SHEERAN IS BACK?????
see you in -Snezhnaya- Fontaine
Okay FINE I'll play catch up 💙😒
You should have heard me squeal when I saw Childe 😅😅😍😍
oh my god. The only thing getting drained is my credit card
OMFGGG CHILDE?!?
the way it gets dark real quick.
IT'S TIME! FRANCE HERE WE GOOOOOOOO!!!!
Did I see Bell claymore is being used by a playable character?!!!!!!?!!!! Finally!!!!!
is focalor the hydro archon?>
Childe?!!!!
WOOOO CHILDE
lord finally fontaine is coming out
Oh my archons I’m soo excited for the characters and the story! It seems so interesting and a wild ride!!
CHILD WELCOME BACK BABE
When I saw Childe I was like "OH COME ON, GO AWAY YOU GINGER WHERE IS MOMMY" but I’m so hyped for Fontaine, MY POCKETS ARENT READY!! :D
MR. WORLDWIDE IS BACK AT IT AGAIN!
The fact theyve previously shown that Arlecchino is involved but have Childe revealed to actively show up in the trailer is so interesting, what are they setting up here 🤔 Like, we know the Fatui is after the Hydro Gnosis, obviously, but whats the angle if theyve got some sort of long term mastermind plot from Arlecchino and then Childe, known for the chaos he brings, also being added to the mix? Makes me wonder if hes actually meant to be involved at all...
CHILDE?????!!!!!!
Me: TIME TO FARM
Worst character-designs so far.
I'd also like to see Childe's rank increase as well since he should be stronger
Genshin,It will be necessary to arrive On the archon mission to reach this region?
TATAYGELAI
I wonder whats wrong with the traveller at 3:55
This makes my heart heavy that I no more can play Genshin impact in my mobile phone :( i would love to play in Fontaine man :'(
Is it just me or does the voice that said "I'm... Wait who am I?" sound like Gregory from FNAF SB
3:48 ok ok ok ok is this Alejandro because oo 👀
pulled an all nighter up until 4 just to watch the livestream
As soon as I see childe I simp
Вааааааааааа, атмосферно невероятно
4:20 CHILDE WHERE IS YOUR VISION?!?!
Where is Xbox version?!
Childe: As my friend from the stars would say: Rules are made to be broken!
OMG TARTAGLIAAA
alv parece VERACRUZ!!!
so cool of them to put furude erika in a modern game
How is liyue the richest nation when fontaine's buildings look like that 😮
AHHHH CHILDE, I' NOT HIS SIMP, but such a cool appearance
I have been waiting TO LONG for hoyoverse to make carnival inspired characters like THEY ARE FLASHY’ER THEN TENGEN AND HIS MICE✨✨😭😭
Damn I'm ready for this, also was jot expecting to see childe at the end that was amazing
*y en que vercion se podra saltar los dialogos y cinematicas? que dan ganas de no jugar con tanto texto* *And in which version can you skip the dialogues and cinematics? that makes you want to not play with so much text*
CONGRATULATIONS TO NAVIA FOR BEING OUR FIRST GEO CLAYMORE!!!
I can’t believe I’m seeing this now and how long I have play this game ever since it’s s a week of release I thought I’m not going to see fontaine well time to wait and see if I’m going to see the nation of cryo
OMFGGGG
ААА ТАРТ ЛУЧШИЙ
Gua msih sibuk KKN blom smpat main v3.8 mlah bntar lgi udah update😑
Can’t wait for Fontaine
I'm getting chillz!!! This is soo good!!! 🤩🤩😭
here i am desperately trying to level up so i can jopin in..
тарталья??? 😯😯😯😯
As someone who has been waiting for Fontaine since they started playing, I’m so excited for this nation and it’s archon to finally release!!!!
bro already? It feels like yesterday
The first second i thought Lyney throw cards, but its his bow xD Twisted Fate? xD
There is tortellini
Interesting how Childe reappears in the Opera house and his first fight theme is "Never Ending Performance"
I really curious about the main conflict
Dang the trailer was so good
Wow
Will there be leviathan class life forms in this version of Subnautica?
God, didn’t know I missed Tartaglia so much till this trailer😭
Finally I can use the bell
ALREADY ???
Myth: The developers of Genshin Impact are good. Reality: The dubbing of the trailers would be much better in Japanese.
AJAX RETURN???
im so excited for fontine, im scared i dont have enough space for it
1st of all; that trailer was dope as hell! Focalors is definitely the chaotic sibling among the archons. Also OUR BOY CHILDE IS BACK BABY! LETS GOOOOO! Side note: I thought the description's "The streets are gray, the fine drizzle like mist" was "The streets are gay, the fine rizzle like mist" lol
Paimon playable character when?
This may be the nation of water, BUT I have my water too!
Dainsleif when
the noise i made when i saw my boy was indescribable i'm so happy he's back in the main story dkjhgloadJG:L
how far am I behind if  the last thing I did was lantern rite.
Focalros on her way to make raiden the least problematic archon 😂😂😂
Sumeru 3.0 trailer is more hype in comparison for me. Fountain looks fun tho.
meh
That was sick🔥🔥🔥🔥
What the Krab doin?
I have no ideas what the hell is going on.
Mr Worldwide is back!!
the was I screamed "CHILDE??" when he appeared on screen
the closed captions are fucked up, theyre all at the beginning and then go away forever
All I could register was..         Oui oui baguette croissant ooh la la
Alercchino????
Still waiting for a baguette to be a claymore
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
If Hoyoverse decides to k1ll Childe, Istg
If Hoyoverse is a Chinese company l don’t understand why is on English… never catch it 😐
So cool!
Tartaglia, bebé ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My fav hydro boy is back
another childe rerun here we go
Музыка как всегда на высоте
CHILDE💕💕
CHILDE LETS GOOO
Was shocked the whole time*
I am still angry that they still dont do an a thumbnail with Lumine🙂
I honestly cant wait for fontaine bro this is gonna be so sick😎
Very Based
AHHAH DA F JSHDKAJGN TARTAGLIA IS HERE GUYS GIVE HIM A ROUND OF APPLAUSE! 👏👏👏👏
I can't even explain the joy for the new update, I genuinely rlly will be returning to play this hame
I thought Focalor's gonna be another chibi archon especially after watching the 1st Fontaine trailer cuz she looked so young and sounds like a child in the video. Just surprised she has a teenager model which I wanted her to be. Nahida will always be my most cutest chibi archon.
i’m literally so excited
Торт в деле пацаны
I’m glad tartaglia is returning! Every since I met him in game he’s been a favorite of mine
CHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLDDDDDDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I’m still excited but I never been a fan of under water exploration in pretty much every game I’ve played lol
Everytime Childe appears in the story I fall in love 😊with him more and more
ah yes, my favourite thing in genshin solving the new nation problems
Just... don't screw up Clorinde's kit, if her gameplay is something like this showed on this teaser and her multipliers are great, then she'll be amazing.
I can’t wait to do Freeze Comp Traveler
Why Tartaglia da bus driver all of a sudden  I'm so happy he's here though 🎉
I literally rolled on the floor when Childe appeared...I didn't expect that
Ohh boy. Buckle up folks I have a feeling that Fontaine is going to basically be like the French Revolution but in Genshin 😭
CHILDE YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS FINALLY!!!! MY MAIN IS GETTING ATTENTION AGAIN
2:03 YEAHHHH FREMINETTTTT TGIBE HIM MORE SCREENTIME
Man these English voices are cringe
Something else is watching over all the seven deities...
YOU'VE GOT YOUR RULES WELL IVE GOT MINE TOO
Arlecchino where😭😭
ME WHEN I SEEN CHILDE JAW:DROPED PHONE:ALSO DROPED  EYES:POP AHHHHHĤHHDHSGSSGC
Always love to see Childe around
that's gonna be sick, justice stuffs are soo impressive
CHILDE ????!!!! What he doing here ???
I think we’re all excited for Teucer.
TARTAGLIA LET'S GOOOOO
the way i screamed when i heard Childe-
Rip mobile users. You had a nice run 💀
FREMINET FRECKLES AAAAH SO CUTE
I think I have a new favorite region 😊💧
When i saw childe jump in i literally screamed and jumped in surprise that i made my sister jump in fear 😆😆😭😭😭now she's threatening me to it again .but i couldn't hold my excitement ☺️😍😍 oh my 🥰😘😁😁our childe came back with force yeah .i love him❤️❤️😭😍so much ill save for his banner for sure 😁wait for me honey
I see where Denathrius is hiding out after escaping the Shadowlands. 👀I like that they chose Ray to voice Neuvillette, a guy who judges people, just like Denathrius in WoW.  I am definitely looking forward to encountering him in Genshin.  Though it is hard to choose between English cast and Japanese Cast. 🥰 I love them both.  I will be looking out for Dreadlords.
Childe can't spend a day without sticking his pretty nose into every foreign nation's affairs, love it for him XD go, Childe!
AAAA WHY IS LYNEY SO CUTTEEEE😭😭
I'm so late to this but god this is beautiful the trailer is fire and childe just made me giggle and kick my feet while I twirled my hair fr
Fantastic landscape
ITS THE BETTER HISOKA!!! all yall simps now can have a less concerning option :)
so we be gettin’ an inazuma archon & archon quest chain! but beside that, is the prophecy going to happen in fontaine? if so, why? half/most of the city establishments already sunken few years ago, is that because of celestia nail? is it because fontaine is getting to advance and somehow getting that “mankind arrogation” ??? just why. Also focalors, is she a self-centered person? wanted to see her people suffer just for her to be entertain?
the only thing i look forward towards is Lynette's stockings, the chars look pretty bad. Toes please
CHILDEEEE
HELP WHAT CHILDE???
Puppets looking like those puppets from hi3
Im not sure exactly when it began But a prophecy has been circulating around Fontaine The people will all be dissolved into the waters And only the Hydro Archon will remain, weeping on her throne...
I'm dead. Did they really called her FoSalor... ?💀Someone need to review both their pronunciation and demonology a bit. Wiki says it's the francophone pronunciation, but this is NOT how it is pronunced at all lmao  That aside, Childe's return really hit hard in this trailer. Bro really knows how to make an entrance.
I’m hyped, but will get Lynette.
OMGGG⁉️⁉️ :0
EW THAT CRUSTY MUSTY GINGER IS COMING BACK 🤢
When do we get the nation of fire!?
WAIT WHY DOES CHILDE HAVE NO VISION, AM I BLIND OR SMT??
DADDY'S BACK
why the call her fosalors in english bruh is a C IT'S FOCCCCALORS
Finally we get to the region i looked most forward to please do it justice mihoyo
AHHHH CHILDE IS GONNA BE BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
I can’t wait for it to come out 😁
OMFG I AM SEATED! I’M READY FOR FONTAINE
if childe dies. I’m gonna cry.
tartaglia!!!! my baby girl!!! I can't wait to pull for him!!!!
TARTIGGLES IS BACK!!!!
Ну что, Чайлд идет по стопам своего прототипа, другого ружего лучника юзающего холодное оружие,  и говорит о справедливости. Что дальше, альтернативная будущая версия, заключившая контракт с чем то и пытающаяся "отговорить" свою младшую версию делать так же?  Блин, всеж надо допройти сюжету Сумеру, а то уж больно привлекательно выглядит Фонтейн.
Omg insane banger the music sent chills down me plus the twins are litr perfect I can’t wait for this story
1:25 tadaa~
childe best part of this by far
Very excited to see how they’ll further expand about what went down between Fontaine and the Oceanids, and explain more as to why the decided to flee from Fontaine long ago.
I think we got set up or somethin  😅
очень жду это обновление, оно само по себе крутое, появится новая локация, механики, фишки и самое главное ещё больше круток) с нетерпением жду обновления
Hydro traveler looks sick I hope its good for hyperbloom :D
FONTAINE SE VIENE CON TODOOOO
Goosebumps the entire time- I can’t wait for Fontaine and CHILDE??
Why i was so sure fontaine were to look a lot like the water city from ffxv?
OMG CHILDE IS BACK!
Childe <3
Id like to think that when Lyne (Or Lynette,I cant remember her name) dissapeared from the tank,RIGHT BEFORE IT FELL AND SHATTERED-Venti mightve saved her.Venti knows the future,and has many relations with the god of time Istaroth.We all know that in every nation an anemo character saves us,and Lyne is the only anemo character in Fontaine...Perhaps Venti had to save her so that she would be well and save the traveller?
Lumine!!! (ಥ﹏ಥ)
Such a flop. Young boys the expansion
УВИДИВ ТАРТАЛЬЮ Я ПРОСТО ВИЗЖАЛА ОТ СЧАСТЬЯ!!!!😭😭😭💙💙💙
A lil bit disappointed that Wriothesely and Sigewinne didn’t appear…but am excited for Lynette and Freminet!
I miss playing Genshin. Plus the additional cost for Welkin 😢
childe is one hell of a wild card. we're never gonna know his next move
Ahhh, I want Fontaine soon!
"In your eyes. The value of human life is nothing compared to thise cold laws you hold so dear."   "Your so called Justice. Your beloved drama. While turning a blind eye to the suffering of the people!   These two lines have me most interested. It sounds like the Hydro Archon is trying her best to save her people all while not informing them of the crisis that's she's preventing from befalling them all. If that prophecy is any indication she might actually fail at doing this. Makes me question what's she's so afraid of?  Also makes me question if we can even prevent it from happening seeing how it might be divine punishment if the lines from Dainlief. "Even she knows not to make an enemy of the Divine." Are any indication this might give us more insight into the overarching story.
The translations in the different languages sound something different in terms of content. Example in the second senteance - german "aber jeder in Fontaine kennt diese Prophezeiung..." and in english "But a prophecy has been circulating around Fontaine..." Why is "But" capitalized in english but not in german? In German it should have been translated to the spoken word and not like a ticked off sentence. -> "Aber eine Prophezeiung kursiert um Fontaine..."  And yes, that is really a completely different representation of the situation and reflects a different feeling.
CHILDE'S EPIC ENTRANCE AND THE FONTAINE TRAILER EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD!!! MIHOYO NEVER FAILS TO AMAZE US OMG I'M SO EXCITED FOR FONTAINE LORE  🔥 🔥
CHILDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I was literally fangirling when I saw Childe at 3 AM. He's just so fine 😭!
omgg it looks so good!! also I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW CHILDE!!! YESSSSS MY BOYYY
Saving all my primo gems to get her 😊
OMGGGGG
I lowkey think that Focalors will start problems herself so that way she can be entertained in the court and she will kinda blame it on other people.
MY BABY GIRL CHILDE IS BACK LETS GO CHILDE MAINS
I know we didn't get much of a showcase, but why isn't anyone mentioning Hydro Traveler? That's one of the more exciting things (for me at least), Archon Quest aside.  Also, at 2:04, Freminet's words match the beat/rhythm
So they increase the amount of obtainable mora for Leylines and possible hero wits too? Can't wait for that =D
only time I play is when a new area is unlocked
FF15?
Welcome To France
Not gonna lie this expansion is very lack luster. Also borderline lame. Not to mention the hydro archon is atrocious
The Gardemek’s look so cool! I hope they’re gonna be Fontaine’s regional enemy.  Also Navia and Clorinde fight scene took my breath away! I’m looking to watching it in game.
La France !
Imagine that’s an actual boss tho😅 1:58
5/7
There's going to be a lot of lore to unpack, isn't there? I'd love it if we can finally learn more about Istaroth. There are just so many unanswered questions about her! But, then again...Hoyo just loves to drop lore bombs and leave us to fill in the gaps. 😂
I can't tell you my hype stat i feel pumped, like a balloon overloaded with gas and want to blast
Yes yes it’s finally out
WOOO CHILDE IS BACK!
damnn this looks fire
Great trailer, but Lumine was again ignored. Making Lumine version of trailers wouldn't hurn anyone, dear Hoyo.
I was wondering what crime we'll be blamed for in Fontaine, guess we just found out lol
2:21 hi daft punk
When I saw Childe I was like "yup time to start playing again!" Man I love childe his comebacks are the best!
WHAT…HOYOVERSE OH MY ARCHONS!? THIS LOOKS SICK!!! YALL REALLY OUTDID YOURSELVES WITH FONTAINE
This actually had me on the edge of my seat… I CANT WAIT😍
Why is nobody talking about the whale-shaped Zeppelin towards the beginning? The pilot better be called Cid or I'm going to Shanghai with my baby powder 😂😂.  Also what if it belongs to us like the Waverider?
UUUOOOOOGGGHH!!!  Bratty archon!  Needs correction! 😭😭😭😭💢💢💢
NO OMG I CANT WAIT WTF I LOVE IT IM IN LOVE I CANT PLS HURRY ISTG
God I’m so excited, this archon quest looks like it’s gonna be really interesting and intense
God fontaine looks absolutely stunning i cant wait for the update i rlly love this game
Means hydro archon is the mean noble than we see in anime
Childe truly is mr.worldwide and very welcome and adore everything in this trailer
FONTAINE BEST REGION 💧💧💧💧💧💧
3:15
WHAT 4.0 IS COMING OUT??😨😨
OH MY GODD NO WAY
this is A PHONE GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!
У меня мурашки. Я вся дрожу, просто, вау.
im so excuted for fontaine i could cry
Childe finally getting a w maybe?
حماس بس وش جاب تشايلد
The hydro archon doesn't feel like an archon
2:17 the sound that escaped my mouth at seeing freminets freckles!!!!
The Bell finally have a use! Wow childe is back
Now that Childe's back on the main questline, do you think Arlecchino is using him as Signora did before?
ААА, ЖДУ ФОКАЛОРЕС И ЛИННА ! ! Хочу их выбить!
So once again we are a wanted criminal 😭
Why is the world of Teyvat so damn gorgeous? I can’t wait for this to be in the game so I can explore, Fountaine looks absolutely beautiful ❤❤
Bros, Childe's vision is missing.
CHILDE
TF ED SHEERAN'S DOING HERE
Guys tartaglia showed up to hang with Navia cuz they’re besties like ed Sheeran and Taylor swift😋😋
WHAT THE RHEELLLLLLLL
FURINA UOOOOHH😭😭😭😭💢💢
We finally got a character that can use the bell
Is it me or us Chlorinde also fighting the mechs at the same time as Taylor Swift? From what I saw, I assumed the mechs were on the side of the court, so why would Chlorinde fight them?
Bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
IT LOOKS SOOO GOOOD OMG IM SO EXCITEDDD
Nah this trailer isnt fire. ITS WATER! (If you understand the reference)
Our first Geo character in over a year and she’s another claymore that likely scales off defence are you kidding me?
Tortellini 😭🔥
2:13 rpm get in gear
nothings says fatui more than " you've got your own rules and I've got mine"
3:44 WHAT HAPPENED TO HER LEGS edit: SHE DIED OH GOD
Can't have the French without a bit of Revolution...
Lo único bueno es el regreso del tartas, por lo demas se queda en veremos, ojala en esta historia si avance el viajero, con toda la información que obtuvo de Nahida lo mas lógico seria que busque información de su hermana entre los once.
Oh genshin is so back
Тутутуттутутутт
WHERE DID CHILDE COME FROM BRO
Ew tartaglia is here, ruined it
Bro i literally jumped out of my chair when Childe came to fontaine I hope to see more of him and that cutscene 😭😭😭😭🫶
Sooo..... in Fontaine we are gonna become a criminals too, confronts The Kings and The Archons, make a movements looks like a Revolutionary  👀 hhhhmmmmmm
WHOOOO!! I don’t think I've been this hyped to play the story in a long time!!❤❤
Fontaine has got to be one if not the BEST looking region in the game so far. Besides Sumeru of course. Fontaine captures that I love about some aesthetics like steampunk or fantasy. It mashed what I love about most things and turned it into something new. Something beautiful. And I adore that. The lack of Arlecchino shown here when we saw her in the last trailer puts me edge. And Childe being there brings up even more questions. Why is he there? Why is he using his delusion and not his vision? And then there’s the situation with the Wonder Trio, Lyney, Lynette and Freminette and what happened to Lynette. I think Fontaine is going to be the point of no return story wise and we are going to helplessly watch as everything crumbles to show the true horrors that lie within Genshin Impact’s story. Bringing us a step closer to its inevitable end
I AM SO EXCITED
МОЙ РЕБЁНОК УРААААААААА
4:39 ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️ Когда вы уже научитесь рисовать люмин???
I was like childe????
the only word i said while watching this was “CHILDE?” ☠️☠️
PLS CHILDE OMFG YESSSS
This is what we call "Extravagance Explosion" 💥 ❤️‍🔥🙌😍
I can't wait to swim underwater with Genshin's characters!!!
I love 4.0 fontaine!؟
IM SO EXCITED FOR FONTAINEEE!!
damn Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran making a comeback here
So many new weapons... 🤩🤤
Childe appearance is the highlight tbh
I SCREAMED WHEN CHILDE APPEARED YES CHILDE SUPREMACY!
All jokes aside, I’ve been waiting for Fontaine since 3.3 AND I AM STILL EXCITED NOW EVEN AFTER I WATCH THIS. THIS IS MORE LIT THAN THE SUN ITSELF-
MEOWWW NAVIA
Childe's entrance... 😎👍
Fontaine's judgement system reminds me of Psycho-pass' Sybil System...give season 1 a watch!
Childe really be traveling more than dora
wow was not expecting childe
i squealed when I saw childe
Childe truly is Mr.Worldwide Lmao he’s everywhere
My crush on Childe is ✨renewed✨
Genshin prime incoming
Looking good
what we were expecting: Arlechino What we got: Childe WTF
AAAAAND SHE’S CONFIRMED!! YEEEES!! FURINA IS CONFIRMED TO BE FOCALORS!!
Why is no one talking about dottore 😭 at 0:33 inside that ship in the air
Childe AGAIN? Now he dies or what
I really like the OST of this trailer, HoYoVerse always makes such great soundtracks.
The way I started screaming and crying once I saw CHILDE-
I ❤ GENSHIN IMPACT
Wakey wakey Im coming😈😈😈
**Spoilers for Fontaine Trailer**  My own theory for Fontaine is that there is a beast in the water draining memories or part of the mechanism of Fontaine. They mentioned energy blocks keep Fontaine running but never said how those were obtained. We see the courthouse and a unique mechanism where the criminals disappear, I theorize that that's how they harvest memories. The courthouse might also have vision blocking properties as we see Childe without his vision. That might be because that mechanism is limited to the courthouse. We also see the Electro captain use her vision with the machines, making it fair to assume that there is a mechanism and its limited to the courthouse so that people can't cause trouble. In that space, only the hydro archon has any power. WIth the exception of the traveler and delusion users as we see with childe. The dialogue from Oceanid further supports that a darker power lurks with "corrupted waters" and itself seeks for tranquil waters. So its likely a mechanism or a beast that lies beneath the surface of Fontaine.
Welp, Focalors you need some screws and wires on your brain to be fixed, we are coming. BE PREPARED!. 🙂
Dude, Fontaine is going to be gorgeous         Especially with your boy, CHILDE
I stopped playing when dendritic region came out…. I regret it
Wait, Tartaglia is come to Fontaine too?
Hyped to explore UNDERWATER
3:00 Simon, get back to Nier
I'm getting some real Bioshock vibes from this. I LOVE IT. ALSO LOOK AT ALL THE RUINS STUFF. LORE FOR DAYS!!!!!
Oh my husband is tartaglia
BRO HAS A BIG FOREHEAD 💀
TALKING STICK
The hype is reaal🔥
4:18 MR. WORLDWIDE RETURNS
I can NOT wait until Fontaine, cant it be tomorrow 😭😭
DAMN IT CHILDE YOURE ALWAYS THERE
Focalors crying at the first scene makes me feel like that's her second personality.
I bet that dude up there is a fatui harbinger
YES OML
Stopped playing a while ago as it just became so much grinding for materials, but man, I'm always amazed by the music and sound effects teams of this game, even more in the trailers
Yessss! CHILDE's coming back!! I can't wait any longer....
Fontaine is just the Hoenn region in Teyvat  Tartaglia gave me chills at the end, our man about to go off.
OST is pretty good
ТАРТАЛЬЯ АОАОАОАО
Fontaine theme from genshin vs  Reverse 1999 lets see who has the best story.
so zhongli is the only original design archon character so far, the other archon is just recycle character from mihoyo
Wtf is Childe doing
The opera singing peak with the new boss mechanics Dancing together was absolutely stunning, so smooth, I want to see more people dance like this now and Tartaglia joining back in with this epic moment, WOW❤
So, Fontaine is so obsessed with legal cases being a soap opera that they've lost sight of all else? Sounds like how Ei was so obsessed with eternity that she just ignored all the chaos in her country.
ağlıycam artık bilgisayar kaldırmadığı için oyanayamıyorum ekran kartı yandı zorlandığı için
I just realised hot electro lady uses a sword :')
OMG childe 😮
Fontaine = drama?!? Love it
DOTTOREEEEE
Why am I only excited about Childe being there 💀
AHHH I CANT WAIT also I love how Childe there 😀😀😀😀😘😘😘
I almost thought lyney was a catalyst user when I saw the cards
Look like childe will help us escape again
why is no one talking about the character that can finally use "the bell" to its full potential
Fontaine looks so lifeless
Not sure if anyone had said this but Lyney looks like Harley from Mobile Legends 😆
Omg Mr. Worldwide (childe) comes to rescue❤❤❤
My favorite part of all this has got to be the section of music from 1:45 to 2:45. Fremintes' sound track essentially but damn that's wonderful to listen to.
You know what I noticed? Lynette has cat ears and a tail but her two brothers do not. Interesting... lore?
MR WORLDWIDEEEEEEEEE
This is the first time I'm experiencing a new map reveal in Genshin Impact. So hyped!
No Wrio? :( Okay. </3
I SCREAMED OH MY GOD, OH MY *GOD* HE'S BACK WHEN CHILDE SHOWED UP, BECAUSE *OH MY GOD*
OMG WILL CHILDE SAVE US!? BIG BROO
freminet finally a character than can hopeful use the bell … mine has been collecting dust
Fontaine is almost out and i still dont have a Keqing..
We all have to agree that Childe really stole the show.
I've been playing genshin for like 10 months now and didn't yet unlock Inazuma. I've been more focused on leveling up my characters that I keep getting (for free), I hope I get to Fontaine soon.  Am I the only one getting "The Great Ace Attorney" feel?
У ГГ БУДЕТОЗВУЧКА
Ich kann es nicht erwarten. HOYO HAT SICH SELBST ÜBERTROFFEN MIT DER WASSERWELT
TARUTARİA I MISSED YOU SO MUCH
Viva la Fontaine
Rip my storage it’s gonna be worth it tho😊 Hydro traveler 😳
dude noone talks how 1:04 - 1:46 is a banger
DON'T KILL THE CHILD!!!
Childe to the rescue 😼
omg its awesome
Yessss genshin!!
Childe was a surprise. Also hoping we will get some info about Nathan
Alfinnnnnn toca madrear una arconte con rabia a rienda suelta y junto al tartas!!!!! Seeeeeeeeeeeeee espero y salvemos a linnete umu❤❤❤❤😢
i hope tartaglia dies (with love)
WOW all 3 of these new characters looks like RESKINS of current characters. Is Lynette just Keqing... The 4 star 2 handed sword character looks like every other character we already have. This game has gone so stale. We are buying the same character over and over again with a new skin. BIG DEAL and EPIC FAIL!
hey where is Childe's vision?
ЖДУ НЕ ДОЖДУСЬ
should totes make a VR version
Did the traveler talk in the trailer? Omg maybe he'll start talking more
Another childe rerun
It's already Fontaine and Genshin still hasn't been released on the Switch
I wonder though, why does it sound like rainfall is such a big deal? Is it not supposed to rain in Fontaine, the land of Hydro? 😭 Also the clock's hands at 3:24,   it's kinda stuck?? I wonder what that signifies. It's happening during the rainfall too 🤔
fontaine easily solos all of teyvat
so is hydro traveler a healer?
Belobog
How much GB will this cost me? 😭
what happened to Lynette?!
... Is that Navia using whiteblind? Are we getting female fontaine itto/another noelle? 🤔 I was expecting something unique... but I guess Genshin is just about to recycle him into a waifu/give us 5* Noelle. On another hand, I thought Clorinde was on the side of Chief Justice, but she's fighting the robots too, perhaps they went out of control? Also, childe doesn't have his vision? Wonder if it's intentional. Definitely interested in how the story will play out.
ТОРТ ВЕРНУЛСЯ!!!
3:26 hype starts
I’m so obsessed with the new robot boss and how they’re bowing/curtseying… so gorgeous
Childe bringing hype as always
If fontaine is already this fire, then what we gonna say about Natlan💀
THE ENDING GOT ME
So the original archon’s memories were erased ooo fontiane is gonna be interesting!
Кароч пон, нашего гг захотят посадить на 8 лет за то что он таскается с Лолей, а придёт торт и сакажет что в Лолях Сила и спасёт всех
CHILDE WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
Someone's actually using the bell..🤯
So another Inazuma but this time, the suffering is for more ppl 😂
IM ACTUALLY SO EXICTEDDD YESSSS
is this honkai impact? bc Genshin Impact changed a lot
Childe being a hydro bearer being forceful at the hydro nation is still epic, snezhnaya all the way! Childe is mr. Worldwide.
THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING
I'M SOOO EXCITED ABOUT ALL THE NEW THINGS THAT THIS VERSION WILL HAVE, I CAN'T WAIT! ✨
TRAVELLERS ASSEMBLE!!!  WE HAVE ANOTHER NATION TO UNCOVER, SEARCH AND REVEAL SECRETS AND MAYBE SAVE IT FROM DOOM
WAIT A MIN ARE WE FIGHTING TWO HARBINGERS?!
ТАРТАЛЕТКА ПРИШЁЛ НА ПОМОЩЬ
That thumnail go HARD af ! I can't wait i can't wait
Genshin has seriously improved with their video trailers, this was so fun to watch!
Hunted by the nation authority again
Mr WorldWide
CHILDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I AM HYPED!!!!!
Tatang
А где Арлекино :_(?
THIS IS AMAZING
Tartags in bound
Lover of Sneznaiyan queen is cheating with the lord of Fountaine? My my...  also..is it just the blue or the traveller has been made to look more attractive
skip cutscene when?
2:46 Why is there kingdom hearts in my Genshin Impact?
I was so excited when u saw childe was coming back to the story! Well done hoyoverse!
im gonna miss sumeru so much but fontaine looks lit af
TARTAGLIAAAAAAAAAAA
Wtf is childe doing there I swear hoyo loves Childe
Tartaglia boutta catch another W lesgoo!
Where the Arlechino?
I started doing my archon quest as fast i saw that a new place came 😭
0:34 is that dottore on the ship I can’t tell omg😭😭
Realize that after this there'll only be 2 regions left, granted that's still 2 years but damn, it's crazy how far we've come
Am I the only one who watched the trailer like this 😮 from the beginning of showing lyney‘s playstyle until the end?
A masterpiece 👌
Always so exciting
holyyyyy
meh
Can columbina pls be a playable character pls I beg you😭
ngl i lost all interest in fontaine the moment childe popped in no business being there except i guess to take the gnosis. should've been a different fatui. meh/10
I was expecting the puppet but CHILD is here too not just archie im speechless
tbh it got sum bioshock vibes from it
I have a feeling Neuvillette will play some similar role to Alhaitham in Sumeru.
Bruh when are we gonna get a cryo catalyst user?!?!?😭😭😭
Geo claymore?
I have the feeling that Childe might die in Fontaine idk why tho
New weapons look just as hot as new characters
Childe will come home or else…
I hope we get to see Yelan too 🙏🏻❤
WE NEED pvp activity
imma simp for them all
Anybody notice how Focalors is the first archon who actually welcomes us? Venti and Zhongli just meets us as a common folk, the Raiden Shogun tries to kill us the first time we meet her and we had to break out Nahida. I already like Focalors!
It's giving Minecraft 1.13 aquatic update 😻
Bro i haven’t had goosebumps from a Genshin trailer since the intro to Inazuma
Jesus loves yall
Gave me actual chills
WOOP
That transition from Lyney to Lynette was so cold
Bro I got chills from watching this
Love how they just slid childe in there 💀
VUELVE TARTAGLIAAAAS ❤❤❤❤❤
HYPEE
Now I got a chance to scuba diving
Absolute best animations honestly
I never been so excited to do the Archon Quest!😂
why did I scream when I saw Childe? lol
OMGG
fontaine seems like it's going to have the most interesting storyline, it seems like we may be getting into more of the darker and corrupt themes
Welcome to Genshin Impact- Ace Attorney edition lol.  That's the feel I am getting here.
Промокоды:  3BRLL59ZCZKD WA845MQHUHKH ZT8MLL8GCYKM
Там дома Смурфиков
oh its fosssssalore i always thought it was fokkkkaalore
TARTAGLIA IS COMING BACK BABY~!~!~!
CHILDE'S BACK BABY!! AHH!!
"finale" as in the end of the game? or the nation itself?
I can’t wait
MACRON EXPLOSION
Childe?! I can't wait for Fontaine now! It's going to be a whole other world, just like the Chasm underground! I'm super excited! And the part where Lynette disappeared from the broken water container... I can't wait to see what'll happen!
Can they really top Sumeru ?
5:39 a _pipe_ weapon?!?! i love that hoyo is getting more experimental w each and every new region!! we went from heizou to mika and now a gunwielding claymore and whoever wields a pipe as a sword in lore 🤩 super excited for this next journey for the traveler!!
Childe probs gonna die 😊
hahaha french people, operas, baguettes, losing a war, oh wait...
CHILDE!????
Fontaine will mostly likely be directly to the right of mondstat
Ahhhh, this is so visually pleasing. There's something about so horror like mystery in Fontaine's lore. And I so love the intro with Focalors and how they describe her near the end. (I'll assume they meant her) "Your so called drama" and the "In your eyes..." part.  Nearly screamed when I saw Childe appeared.
It was just fine!
I LOVE THIS MUSIC
man i cant wait. ever since sumeru the quality of the game has improved so much.
U CE GOT UR RULES WLEL IVE GOT MINE TPO
This trailer tok my heart and destroyed it but at the same time maked me cry Of happines. Bruh xd
NAVIA GEO CLAYMORE CONFIRMED
Really excited for Hydro Traveler, hope they don't disappoint.

I know I’m not the only one who came from tiktok…..
OMGGGG WOWOOWOWO SORRY BUT IM SO SO EXCITED MY GOSH  TY PUT HIM IN AN ARCHON QUEST AGAIN TYSM MAN IM SO HAPPY I NEED MORE CHILDE IN MY LIFE!!!! But at the same time im crying... my school starts next week :'c

Oooo can’t wait to pull for that new Archon her voice and design makes me week in the knees 😌
YES

YESSS FOCALORS IS A COLD HEARTED PSYCHOPHATH YEESSSSSS
i accidentally had the captions on in the first few seconds aw hell nah i'm not reading that
MY HUSBAND TARTAGLIA!!!!!🥹
CHILDE OFFICIAL STORY CONTENT FINALLYYYY
1:25 can we talk about how cute lynnettes tada was??
I'M SO EXCITED
THE ARE SOOO GONNA OUTDO SUMERU'S STORY!
CHILDE IS BACK HES BACK A A A A A A 😭😭😭
4:20 Ariana what are you doing here?!
3:43 i can't believe we are actually hearing the traveler talk in a trailer. i hope this means he will talk more in the fontaine archon quest. no offense to paimon, but i would prefer to hear zach's voice.
Childe becoming a hero confirmed??
AAAAA Tartaglia ❤
Guys Why Turkish Translate is so goofy
hmm looks boring... :< I guess I'll wait for the lore experts to talk about this, maybe they can help me hype myself up for this. The problem is prolly because I'm dumb.
Orgasmico☄️☄️☄️🌊🌊🎩🎩
Mr World Wide is back at it again
3:37  what happened to Lynette?!😭😭😭
Hopefully this brings me back into the game, but just seeing everything that I have to do in Sumeru, makes me not want too 😂
Finally, the rightful owner of the bell
I love how this trailer's aspect ratio is different from what we had so far, it feels like a movie and I absolutely love it!!!
Im so happy i have been waiting for Fountain for years 😭
I hope we can finally play as electro Childe in the coming patches
I feel like Fontaine will be like a K-Drama.
Absolutely marvelous Trailer!So hyped up for Fontaine, And Freminate is the first Claymore user Iam having an urge to pull for,His VA is so soothing😮‍💨
Estou ansioso para essa atualização,mas, uma coisa me deixou meio decepcionado, o ataque mais forte do lyney. realmente achei super sem criatividade, vai ser difícil a ult mais forte dele dar um dano alto. pior de tudo foi que comecei jogando o jogo por causa dos irmãos que quando descobrir que só iriam aparecer em Fontaine deixou-me muito triste. esperei 3 anos pra um personagem sem criatividade no combate
Are people just ignoring the fact that she said "Dear God"??????? 💀 3:59
ih my goodness, this is so exciting! wait for me while i re-watch this masterpiece.
Everything looks so cool I can't wait anymore
Painting perfect
Hydro Archon's character seems to be weak. Sumeru's release was way better.
nois
I swear if I have to finish Sumeru to get to Fontaine ima cry 😢
Wow I can’t wait for Fontaine and the new characters
4:14 watch it 0,25 and thank me later 🤒
FURINA MY GIRL
Can we renonce childe to be not a fatui anymore? Like he has such a good heart why is he part of people who seem so dark
bro i will not have enough storage on my ipad for this. imma go cry in the corner😢
О МОЙ БОГ АЯКС БУДЕТ В СЮЖЕТЕ
HOLD ON- IS CHILDE GOING TO F**KING SAVE US?? HOLY SHI-   (I know he probably isn't, just let me dream for a sec-) but whatever the case, im so happy to finally see him again 🥺😭❤️❤️  This trailer was 🔥🔥🔥
I'm so excited for the new region and archon !!! I can't wait to see Childe again, I wasn't expecting to see him in this trailer lmao
So .... Where's Arlecchino?
Seeing tartaglia come back in the archon story quest is so refreshing after dealing with scaramouche for a while 😭
TARTAGLIA BABE I MISS YOU SO MUCHHHH
0:10 the prophecy 0:19 welcome to fontaine 1:04 lyney 1:24 lynette 2:09 freminet 2:50 the previous hydro archon (maybe) 2:58 twin world boss 3:47 i will have order! 3:57 blonde lisa (fix this: navia=itto, clorinde=sara) 4:03 dark jean 4:19 he is back for more (yeah)    Theories about why childe doesn’t bring his hydro vision: 1. The fontaine authority confiscated his vision. In the trailer, he probably was trying to get it back. 2. Childe hides his vision cuz furina could easily recognize the oddities of vision shapes.
EFFING CHIILDEEEEE FINALLY. Dude this is hype, we’re are going to be wanted criminals again 🎉
OH MY GOD! I SAW CHILDE! DUDE I SWEAR IM SO EXCITED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS NATION 😭😭😭😭😭
I want the new enemies in the abyss 😍😍😍😍 it looks beautiful
Childe buff incoming?
Furinas english voice is amazing, the GROWL
Imagine we take part in the French Revolution
My god i was expecting lynette's voice to sound as dead as her eyes
THE WAY I SQUEALED AT 4:20 MY BOYTTYYYYYYYY
Oooh boy, I can't wait!
YESS MY BOY CHILDE COMES IN FONTAIN I AM SO HAPPY THANK YOU GENSHIN
oh my god i'm so excited and intrigued i can't WAIT also WHAT IS CHILDE DOING HERE
"L'État, c'est moi"                              - Foucalour XVI -
Tbh I'm glad Childe is back, this all looks exciting
I really hope Lynette has a Big role with us, the travellers, like in the Other nations, always an anemo saves us
AHHHH IM SOOO EXCITEDDD
LA COMMUNAUTÉ FRANÇAISE VOUS ÊTES LA?
WoW 😮❤
R.I.P Criança
I audibly gasped when I saw Childe enter the frame oh my gosh this whole trailer has me on edge 😮
BEST. THING. I'VE. SEEN.
God I’m so excited for this!!!!!
Childe is the real MC of Genshin Impact.
ITS CHILDE OMG
I'm hyped for this
CHILDE ??????
NAVIAS A GEO CLAYMORE THE SAMSARA CONTINUES
MY MAN CHILDE IS BACK
This entire teaser was absolutely amazing but as an OST appreciator i can't help but repeat Freminet's part(2:09) because his theme was so beautiful!Can't wait for it to be released,i also can't stop repeating the 3:38 part as that's when everything becomes chaotic,overall,Fontaine looks like it's going to be one of the best nations in the game and i can't wait for it's release
"your beloved drama while turing a blind eye to the people" ya furina gonna be the antagonist
Childe takes the spotlight again 👌
wow cant wait too see them this is awsome
CHILDE CHILDE CHILDE CHILDE
I’m so glad I got out of my Genshin burn out a little bit ago
WHO IS THAT GIRL WHO LOOK LIKE RAIDEN???
LOL CHILDE IS BACK
i just wanna find my sibling bro not save another nation from its dilemma 😭😭
Goy game
Why do i feel nothing in this trailer? Is it because of burnout?
Ahhh everything looks so darn cool I can't wait😭
DAMN BEST TRAILER SO FAR
Can we just talk about the trailer it looks so cool new characters to meet up,new boss fight,and Tartaglia coming back even the characters looks amazing I can't wait for Fontaine also im waiting for focalors
is childes hydro vision missing or am i the only one trippin???
ED SHEEREN STAY OUTTA THIS
bro im so excited
The Archon acts just like the Brat memes and i love it
Can I say I love this game ? I love this game. I'm happy I decided to play it ! The OSTs are marvellous, the visuals are gorgeous, and i'm so excited to discover the new storyline !
childe makes such dramatic entrances js to be folded by the traveler moments after 😭
I don't know why but after seeing the trailer I am more enthusiastic about Snezhnaya that we will soon be able to reach the end of the journey what Lumine was talking about and Know more About khanriah and it's people
Dayum I bet there’s a lot quest and I’m gonna play until it finished lol AND I WANT DADDY ZHONGLIII
TARTAGLIA!!!!
Ain't no way they're killing Lynette
Finally the bell claymore got a user!!!
Hope 4.0 helps us remind how precious of a resource water is. Even more than Primos I'd say.
Childe gives me goosebumps 🔥
Em que parte anunciaram os banners?
This trailer got me excited to play
Oh my gosh this is sick!! I’m so excited
I don't wanna leave Sumeru :( edit: fineee, i'll leave to see Childe again
Childeeeee
is it just me or is that part of collei's theme at 1:35? is that like a house of the hearth motif possibly?
My Highlight of the whole Trailer: Tartaglia is back 😍😍😍😍
WHY IS CHILDE HERE AGAIN??
Spending time at the bottom of the sea in peace sounds really nice
We all know what awaits us when we visit the land of kryo
I'm so hyped for this
I feel like Fontaine will be full of drama, but its gameplay might be fun!!
neuvilette: and your attorney? childe: the defense would like to call upon this killer whale to the stand.
Size of update?
Hydro Archon sounds like Fishl💀
This is all so cool but… did she say it like Fossalor ?? I’ve been calling her Fokalor this whole time !!
MY BABY FOCALORS AAAAA
Dat ginger showing his face ruined this trailer, I hope he becomes the first playable character to die in this game and gets killed in the most pathetic way possible.
wow that will be amazing
Надеюсь успею накопить крутки
Avatar el camino del agua el evento :v
I can't f--ing wait.. Genshin's underwater exploration looks clean af. Idk about other players but I'll definitely take my time to explore Fontaine. I don't want to rush this masterpiece.
@2:46 And just like that we Bioshock now
Finally! Childe can actually prove he's our ally instead of the other way around!
The ost… omg
Rip mobile players :(
Can’t wait
Did anyone else notice that Tartaglia didn't have his Hydro Vision in the trailer?😅
BABY?!!!!!! CHILDEEEE!!!!!! AAAAHHHH😭
The description on the video itself is really interesting, I guess the whole plot is just a scheme from probably Furina?  - Nova
People who picked lumine:ಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ
holyyy tartaglia i have been missing him
Чет шняга какая то
на протяжении всего видео у меня были дикие мурашки а под конец я засмеялся чуть ли не заплакавши как же круто как же божественно! ура мы этого дождались
I need Lynette's "ta-dah" 1:25 for notifications :)
GOOOO CHILDE!!!!
I don't think I can play genshin on my phone anymore after Fontaine is released 💀
I bet its because of all the pollution in the water that it's taking away peoples memories and soon the people. It probably has to do with the Oratrice's power source. In the most recent desert map's world quest, we discover that a Fontaine expidition team found an energy source called Azosite, along with some other findings, that they would bring back with them. I bet that what they discovered back then is what is powering Fontaine currently. In the livestream they mention a woman invented energy blocks with the Arkhe reaction over 400 years ago(so just after the Cataclysm), but as we learn in Sumeru, Ruin Guard machines are also powered by a thing called Energy Blocks, which means yep, Fontaine is being powered by Khaenri'an tech. The same Khaenri'ah that was destroyed for their tech not following the Heavenly Principles' guidelines. And I bet Fontaine doesnt have a very good understanding of the tech either, which means it's much more likely that something will go wrong. Either bad things are happening because they don't know how to take care of it properly, or it's the Heavenly Principles punishing them for using illegal technology
Does this region remind anyone else of honkai? Like the outfits and characters especially
Guaranteed , hold rolls until archon
I'm getting goosebumps from this absolute masterpiece!
when will this update come?
Fontaine's story seems similar to that of HSR in Jarilo-VI ...you start friends with the Archon, then something happens that frames you as a criminal and some other character from the underworld help you escape. I'm really liking Furina and her personality so far ...and Childe, i've always disliked him but it all indicates he will redeem before my eyes. :P
hoyoverse doing history with their trailers wow
is it just me that hates the hydro archon?
This is AMAZINGGGGGGGN, FONTAINE IS beautifull, this is epic ,legendary ,very legendary , and the best thing is that is CHILDE ,  this is very gooood
Oh my gosh CHILDE??? HIII

God if fontaine delivers me childe lore i might combust
The sea will overtake everything, and justice will never prevail again.        COOL!!
Saw it quadruple times! Yet giving me goosebumps watching childe
Aaaah I’m so excited!!!!
time to download it again
Where is arlechino? i told you mr. Hoyo, WHERE IS SHE! 😕
This trailer was already soo cool and when childe appeared I  literally screamed his name loudly . At this point it does not seem like a game at all but a super good anime!!!!
Im ready for the revolution
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! Omgsss this is totally fire🤩
CHILD !!!! Just WOW ! I didn't expeted he will return ! That amazing ! Im so hyped by Fontaine ! Just WOW !
hello did Lynette just vanish from that water tank what—
very excited for soggy france
It wasss soo good but not as much as Inazuma's
Minigame Impact💀
finally
CHILDE YOOO
fontaine trailer for my birthday, awesome
4:20 hi, kitten
I stopped breathing ...
If I had a nickel for every time Childe came to bail us out after we were suspected of a crime, I'd have two nickels. It isn't a lot, but it's weird that it's happened twice.
After watching new Genshin trailer *  Me : Who's the protagonist of this game anyway???
Tartaglia stans: we're so back!
Now waiting for catwithbluehat to do a breakdown for this trailer👀
If this trailer was supposed to make me exited, it didn't. I've been playing since release and each new region had something interesting, but Fontaine seems tasteless and empty. Neither characters nor story are engaging compared to Sumeru or Inazuma. Perhaps this will be the last time I play it.
WHERE IS CHILDE’S VISION
IM SOOO EXCITEDDD
Es hoy es hoy!!! :D
holy this is awesome!!
I’m saving my primogems for focalors
And have only explored 18% of sumeru... This looks awesome
ONLY 10 DAYS MY PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!
hu tao and focalor may be they have same personality..  i'll pair them in the same team
Bruh I haven't even really started exploring Sumer nooo
3:57  Anyone notice Aether here?
Es INCREIBLE.
New characters < child rerun!
NAVIA IS A CLAYMORE USER????
The fact i skipped the whole trailer and just went to childe's part 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
BRO FOCALPRS IM SCREAMING
4:19 ariana grande what are you doing??  Also from 4:08 to 4:14 I remembered the Batman movie trailer when the riddler said: “ if you are Justice, Please don’t lie. What is the price of your blind eye?” I was like 😮 Actually there’s something in common between them Fontaine is France and Batman this year was in France if you know what I mean
MY GOD, FONTAINE WILL BE MY FAVORITE REGION!
CHIDOE
Looks like I'm coming back, Genshin. i am soooo behind
Will The Bell stonk?
Some of those places will fill all my cottage core needs
TARTAGLIA IS BACK YAYYYYY
So this is Fountaine... reminds me of the Kalos region. Should be interesting.  Bon chance everyone
2:58 the master touch ✨
I LOVE GENSHIN IMPACT
Este fue el peor live stream de todos hasta ahora. No hay nada nuevo, ninguna novedad que la comunidad haya pedido antes, solo viene mas de lo mismo, personajes, mapas, y ya esta, no hay mas novedad. Ustedes realmente desprecian este juego, espero les vaya bastante mal en ventas a partir de este momento y que el futuro Honkai Impact no sea bien recibido por la comunidad, simplemente no merecen el apoyo de nadie.
So from what I can gather, there are 2 big factions in Fontaine…. And with these mechs attacking, I truly hope that is what unites the nation’s people to fight against the injustice of the court. Even Tartaglia joins to help fight… i believe that Arlecchino may have set off the mechs, she’s likely the traitor symbol in the Fatui member wheel, backed up by Tartaglia’s one voice lines about her selfishness… she may have betrayed the Fatui!
me: oh cool- TARTAGLIA WTF ARE U DOING HERE?!
This is like bioshock but on land lmao everything feels so steampunk like 🔥
I am going to love this update might be my fav update so far!
Is Lynette dead 😱
All amazing until they show boring events.
AYO WHERE HER LEGS GO?! 3:42
My beloved Harbinger is back!
Expectations: Yanfei in Fontaine’s Court. Reality: Childe in Fontaine’s Court.
Anyone else get a stuck up bratty evil vibe from the hydro archon?
I can feel the magic of genshin again, this is gonna be an insane update
Am I the only one worried about the fact that Childe is back? He's using his delusion in the trailer, and even though I absolutely love him, it's never good when Childe shows up. Also, as probably most of us know, his name was inspired by that Greek legend with the Ajax guy with a brother named Teucer. Problem is, in the legend, Ajax died in the end. A lot of game conspiracy channels on YouTube talk about how it's highly possible Childe will die. Hopefully he won't...
buff dehya
Childe, the real main character
WHEN I TELL YALL I SCREAMED “GINGER” WHEN CHILDE APPEARED LMAOOOOAA
The drama, the style and the music is JUST SO GOOD IM SO EXCITED FOR FONTAINE!!!
1:45 my favorite part
Nah Tartaglia Is  the only good point HE WILL COME BACKKK 😭🙌😌
Where Arlechino
Yooooooooo
I have a feeling this ones gonna be dark SO EXCITED THOUGH!
WHAT'S TARTAGLIA DOING THERE.
the seaborn have risen
SAVE ME CHILDE!
CHILDE IS BACK CHILDE IS BACK
Im hype AF!!!
Oh my god. I'm so hyped for Fontaine. Childe is finally back! The place looks beautiful, and the story is of course something I can't wait to know. It's full of drama and mysteries, exactly what I love! I need to meet them all now, especially Furina.
Siempre opacando a los viajeros
Oh perfect we're done with the utterly pointless guessing game of who's the Archon. We simply know who the Archon is from word go. Great.
I thoight hoto forgot Childe..
Who let childe cook 🔥🔥
It just keeps getting better, huh? Though what intrigues me most of all is how Wanderer's role in the main story is apparently going to continue into Fontaine.  Also: The judge guy (dont know his name) was in that cutscene with Lyney and Lynette performing, as well as both paimon and the traveler in the foreground. [sidenote, apparently he's also got khaenri'ah eyes] The Iron sting, Whiteblind, and Bell, two of which are craftable and the third is also mechanism based in design. Tartaglia with an emphasis on his electro delusion. A callback to the Oceanid event that stated they were running away from something in Fontaine, their homeland. Focalors seemingly welcoming us to Fontaine herself Fire crab The mechanical soldiers are called Gardemechs, and the numbers seen are apparently unheard of. While they could be entirely new automata, i wouldn't be surprised if the story plays it out to be based of designs from khaenri'ah The one electro lady actually destroying said Gardemechs, same with the blonde. Just deceptive framing.
Omg this is a amazing 🤯
WHAT IS CHILDE DOING THERE?
Back to genshin again? Ehmm
I love this game so freaking much
Childe get outta here I want a new harbinger reveal
CHILDE IS GOING TO HELP US !? YES BABEEEEE
First Childе did some trouble in Li Yue, now he came to Fontaine What a fidget boy)
How many times you saw this teaser? Me: Yes
Bro childe has enough death flags idk if Fontaine is gonna be it guys 💀 (out of 9 harbingers that can appear, he does again, coincidence? I think NOT)
WHATS TORTILLA DOIN THER
Да ладно, сигнатуркой фермента будет Колокол?! Неаозможно!😱😱
BEST SHOWCASE OF ALL TIME!! cant wait for 4.0 update lets hope the characters aint as bad as some ppl ik..def gonna try and get lynette >_<
end it use copy skill of kpee i don't want him anymore
Freminett is a boy...
Люди, это не учебная тревога! У Тартальи нет глаза бога на поясе! Повторяю: НЕТ ГЛАЗА БОГА НА ПОЯСЕ 4:20
Oh my goodness, my jaw was on the floor during this entire trailer-
I think the english VA should be more carefully chosen. Lyney sounds too much like the new tighnari, Freminet sounds like Cyno...  I think this is the weakest trailer . The colors of fontaine look like sumeru even the setup could be just placed in sumeru, there is no real plot or drama that makes you look foward to (compare it to the inazuma trailer back then)
TARTAGLIA AAAAAAAAAA SO COOOOL SO AMAZING!!!!
FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
It's been a long time since Tartaglia disappeared from the game. Welcome back Childe .!
Childe going places fr
Tighnari and Collei music notes sounds repetitive, but now it doesn't sound repetitive.
This wasn't even half as epic as 3.0 version trailer. By the terms of quality, it feels more similar to 2.0 version trailer.
Clorinde is so damn hot despite having barely 5 seconds of screentime, also did they pretty much recycled anemo skills for hydro? the tornado and hand blast is such a pissfart idk why they make it look so similar
I can't lie, I wasn't too interested with the Teaser during 3.8's Livestream. Overture didn't really change my mind either, I was still skeptical whether or not Fontaine will disappoint me. However, with the actual trailer out now, I'm proud to be on the hype train as I'm HYPED FOR FONTAINE 4.0! LET'S GO BOYS AND GIRLS 💥
ХОЧУ ФОКАЛОРС,ТЕ КТО ЛЮБИТ ФОКАЛОРС СТАВЬТЕ 💙!ЗА ГИДРО АРХОНТА-ФОКАЛОРС!❤️‍🩹💙
페이몬 목소리 뭔가 바뀐거 같은데?
Childe????????
Mom i want Childe (delusion) but we have Childe t home. . .  Childe at Home : **frickin 120 sec cooldown to make ppls wet**
CHILDE!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Fontaine, coming out on my birthday? Best gift ever.
no glimpse of my wriothesley 😭
Lyney is sooo like nene
Genshin really has something against guys wearing pants
Que emoción y ganas de ir a fontaine,y saber que pasara, la aparición de Ajax hace que mi emoción suba al 200%. Va a ser increible.
Amazing. Oh, my lord amazing.
im so glad fontaine is coming out around exams cus it gives me something to look forward to after them!
Childe making his entrance like a Chad!
Is Childe helping the traveler or he got into his own mess?
Me watching this: Childe comes out of nowhere  Me:WTF WHAT ARE YOU DOING RICH MAN?????
Fontaine >> sumeru ez🙏
seems like whenever the traveller visiting new countries for the first time, the authority wanna arrest or kill them. The milllelith tried to arrest them because of they become the prime suspect of Rex Lapis appereant death. The Shogunate tried to kill them because they was, more or less, suspected to conspiring with the rebel ( although in the end they are indeed working together againts the Shogunate ). And the academia of Sumeru tried to arrest them because they want to folly the Sage's plan. And, although it was happening quite sometime after they arrive at Mondstatd, The knights also tried to arrest them because they was spotted tried to steal a legendary treasure. They do have some problem with authority.

Water 7 Arc?
smell childe upcoming banne
seeing so many people hype for childe has me all giddy im used to seeing people trash on him 24/7 but he’s one of my absolute favourites and i am so excited to see him back
CHILDE.......
Me:😊 My phone:💀
CHILDE CHILDE 4:32
when i'm telling you i screamed out "CHILDE?!" without filter, i am saying the truth, i actually did that
its really like belobog like the leaks said 😂
childe really pops tf up everywhere
Again we can confirm that Childe is our truly Mr. Worldwide
kinda meh
MAN 4.0 IS GOING TO BE FIRE 🔥
Wann kommt das Update 🤩🤩🤩
Childe is back!!!!
I DID NOT EXPECT CHILDE
3:00 Atomic Heart Reference??
This looks INCREDIBLE 🩵🫧
So excited !!!!!!
Erinnert mich irgendwie an altisia aus final fantasy 15
I KNEW THAT CHILDE WAS COMING BACK!!! IM SO HYPED FOR HIS RETURN RARADDBNS
Childe reappearing in Fontaine is a welcomed surprise.
T-tartaglia???!!?!?
i cant stand childe, i wanna see more of the others harbingers cmon
New nation fontaine, I love it this new nation
This archon is so sus lmao 🤣
Seems cool, Dishonored 2 Clockwork Soldiers are nice, Tartaglia showing off too, just dont make it and insuferable highwall of text.
There’s that dull sword again…
sumeru first trailer was much More exicitting
At last Childe will have some prominence, seeing him at the end was exciting
I was waiting for my favorite nation .... For years...
please add freminent in the archon quest wearing his stupid helmet. I love him
SO HYPE
What's the lover of snezhnayan queen doing here?
Not only is Childe's return exciting, its absolutely baffling how hoyo manages to make this game even more beautiful with each update. Not to mention all the amazing osts! Super excited to dive into Fontaine!
Tempted to watch but don’t want to spoil myself. Excited nonetheless!
GOING CRAZY FOR CHILDE BEING IN THE TRAILER GAHHHHHHHHH HES BACK, MY FAVE 😭💕
простите что там забыл Тартальяя???
me when Tartaglia appeared: 💃💃👰‍♀ saw him using the delusion again : 🥲🥲
Why do we keep breaking the law in every new country we visit XD
Childe must be the William Afton of Genshin— why? *Because he always comes back*
Всё выглядит интересно, Кроме гидро Гг
Perhabs we will see the GREATEST revolution for the entire history of Teyvat...Ladies and Gentleman, it's Fontaine
Whatever you do dont translate Freminet to russian .       Please i beg of you . Dont for the sake of your sanity
I can already see myself fighting those mechs in the abyss
waiting for lyney ehe
Can't wait for this masterpiece😍
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
WTF TARTAGLIA IS BACK LOL
I hope hyo add tartaglia finally form as outfit
Switch port when?
Ну неужели. Сумеру вообще не понравился, почти год не играл, все ждал чего-нибудь красивого)
Ok, so by now we can say that the threat of Fontaine is this Oratrice, an conscious AI that works with the court delivering judgments, in the preview Dain says that even Faurina could be condamnted, so this AI works besides her influence, during the trailer we see that the traveler will meet this conscious some how, it look very similar how the traveler enter in the Irmusul and Ei's Euthymia space at the beggining of the others archon quests
YOU CAN SWIM, HOLY BEJEEZUS YOU CAN SWIM!!!
3:42 Lynette's drowning! 😢 I hope she's okay, and it's just actually a magic trick. Being unalived by water is terrifying...
МАМАА Я ВЛЮБИЛАСЬ
Hello childe welcome back❤
حمااااسس ألفف😭😭😭💗
I'm so hyped for Fontaine!!! I've been waiting since Inazuma. Focalors too is just perfect. Been waiting since her leak.
Наконец-то я дождался нового региона!!! Не думал, что Тарталья вновь выручать будет. А хотя кто знает может опять втянет нас в свою игру.
Every time there Aether arrives at a region he is accused of something just for existing...
4:20 Where is his vision..?
Guys put the subtitles on for the first seconds of the video and tell me if you feel attacked like i did lol
Nice
childe lindooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
As a Childe main, I have never been so hype.
TARTAGLIA MY BOOOOOOY
Tartaglia is hereeee yessirrrr
Can we notice that we will get a claymore named "Talking Stick"? The Debate Club is finally gonna have a sibling!
If you pair the Hydro Traveler’s Ult with Ayaka’s ult 💀
everything is cool but... CHILDE STEALING THE SHOW FOR REAL!
TARTAGLIA FINNALLY! TIME TO PLAY AGAIN!!!
I'm glad childe is back, man wants some smoke and I'm all for it.
4:23 THIS. IVE BEEN WAITING FOR HIM TO RETURN TO THE MAIN QUESTS FOR SO LONG.
Im already hyped and I just can’t wait Gesus this is beautiful!
Im guessing focalor is somewhat like Ei , turning a blind eye to her people's suffering but this seems wayy better written then inazuma and im guessing furina and / or nuivellate (i cant spell his name sorry) is the main villian here and alecharino may also being a villian , we didnt see her in the trailer so its makes me wonder that is she the main harbinger of fontaine or is childe im happy with either and the 2 dancing robots have a beautiful dance and i hope lynette is ok or ill go on a killing spree and one last thing childe you made me simp for you again tenfold
1:50 reminds me so much of Giselle's house from Enchanted. Also where tf is my mommy Arlecchino? 🥲🥲🥲🥲
Furin gives me fischl vibes
I love how this game is dying , just  compare the views between videos. Even less and less ppl playing it.
CHILDE?????????
4:01 WAIT WHAT NAVIA IS A CLAYMORE 😦
:0
CHILDE IS BACK!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Tartagalicious🐋
hydro claymore? heck yeah! been waiting for one for ages now.
Hey hey, there's another femboy like Venti  Also Venti: Wow, another femboy like me! welcome to the club!
i didn't expect childe to come back!!!!
im so excited. getting chills
Fiquei todo mole
yo mah boi tartalgia is here good to see him again
Wow Hisoka
I’m Honestly so excited for Fontaine! Genshin gets more fun with every new update and region they add!   For some reason it feels like yesterday when inazuma and sumeru first came out and was introduced!
4.0 about to be a movie!!!
Something something the dark age of the law something something probably someone will be wrongly accused
Yep. The hydro archon deserved to lose her gnosis.
Ok it seems like I'll finally reinstall this game.
Nice
I DIDNT KNOW THAT CHILDE WENT TO FONTAINE 😱😱😱😱
I want to play ELECTRO TATRAGLIA af. GIVE HIM TO MEEE
Clorinde at 4:05 sure has that Raiden look.
Omg i have no words
We have six other harbingers that haven't been part of a story arc yet and yet we get Tartaglia again. I know some people are happy and that's great for them, but I'm so disappointed. Him showing up ruined an otherwise perfect trailer.
Wriothesley voice at 4.07???
at this point can anyone deny Childe is not hoyo fav genshin character and secretly the MC
Wish I could still play this game, my phone has ran out of memories 😢
bro childe jumping in at the end made it 10x better. And can I say how much I love those dancing machines (?) it’s so elegant.
OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG TARTAGLIASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS 😍
Man I cannot wait for Fontaine to release!
Honestly, the story feels like what you would expect, the same, so I'm kind of underwhelmed but Child showing up was cool.
Новое оружие! Ура!!!
I CAN JUST PICTURE CHILDE SAYING HEY GIRLIE HOLD STILL
Genshin impact: How the story takes a darker turn.(Suffering of the traveler)
I CANT WAIT 10 MORE DAYS I NEED IT NOWWWW
Omg!!! Yes I am so excited!!!
Yeah, I love Tartaglia.
Neuvilette gives me huge hidden antagonist vibes  Or like someone who actually wants to take the power fully from Focalors, especially with how he is presented in the poster.
This trailer was meh till childe shows up. NOW IM HYPED FOR FONTAINE!!!!
I FOLLOW YOUR RULES TARTAGLIAAAA. ONLY YOURSSSSS❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Fontaine looks more like a children's amusement park rather than a futuristic city.
Wow, it feels like they leaned more on the artistic side than the quirky mechanical side making it feel like a wanabee piltover but at least the place looks cool.
Finally Steampunk alike, LETS GOO!!!
my theory is that since fontaine is the nation of justice, the traveler got into some trouble and got into court. for some reason childe comes to save us from getting into jail since fontaine's image of justice is messed up(?) and in the other teaser for fontaine, the hydro archon wants more cases? correct me if i'm wrong
1:25 yeah there’s like lore and story but there’s also cute girl saying cute thing
4:06 is my favourite part. It gives me goosebumps!!
So like I am happy we finally get some Childe content but Childe is in every nation at this point- LOVE IT!
Childe so popular he's in Fontaine, truly Mr. Worldwide
So we're wanted for... the murder of Lynette? This is going to get interesting.
Damn
Childe 🗿 he is on waterrrr 💦
Here comes the Finale
Damn at this point Childe really is Mr Worldwide isn't he?
Не надо делать из Тартальи такое же тряпочное, унылое гoвно как из Скарамучи. А судя по трейлеру, так и сделают :(
an artificial intelligence that determines who is guilty and who is not? I already saw that in psycho pass before, they are brains!!! everything is a hoax!
CHILDE CHILDE CHILDE CHILDE CHILDE
Water 7 Vibes
tartaglia senpai i want his banner now
love the part where Childe got lost in a nation ruled by a sassy lost child.
Idk why I'm excited to see childe in the trailer more than the fountaine itself😂
Finally my hero showed up😭
Imm gonna main lynette
The Bell finally seeing some action. 2:50 Almost looks like a hydro cicin mage.
This focalors just because she is the Hydro Archon she can do what she wants to do, even it's break the law no principle, she is a shame compare to the previous. She's not even fit the role of being an archon what a selfish bratty archon.
Here we go again the traveler is on the wanted list in another nation
CHILDEEEEEE
i think it would be rly cool if there was a danganronpa style trial that you had to play through!
DUDE I STARTED SCREAMING WHEN I SAW CHILDE IM SO EXCITED WHATT
This actually looks insane omg
лучшая игра в мире
Is Freminet just Khoi?
goodbye storage on my phone
I feel like clorinde might be a story exclusive boss if not then the judge guy will be one  Edit: i found out that she is on travelers’ side in the trailer
There is always more than meets the eyes.
Lumine main be like:Sasuga from geo archon mobile wallet
2:09 Do we finally have someone who can actually use the Bell? lol
worst trailer so far
Whole new cast and plot: wooOo  Childe makes appearance: WOOOOOO!!
My new fav region after Sumeru 😍
I’m so excited!!!
Разработчики Геншин импакт когда будет хороший сюжет без детских диалогов и когда мы узнаем кто такая Паймон?
Tartaglia my GOAT
I can see another Childe Re-Run happening 😀
CHIIIIILDE
4:24 It's been 2 years (last v1.1) since Childe uses his delusion 😘
freminet and albedo same voice actor ?
Es tartaglia! Es real!  Tomenme una foto con el
GAHHH IM BOUT TO GET EXCITEDDD
OMGGGG MY LOVEEE. MY TARTAGLIAAAAAAAA TARTAGLIAAAAA ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤. ILOVE YOUUUUUUUU
So... We're against an Archon... Again... I don't want to leave the Sumeru yet ;-; *Looks at the desert, covering ¾ of it* You know what? Okay, maybe it really is time to leave Sumeru... But I'm taking Nahida with me...
this is going to be so good
4:12 ✨THEM✨
imo it shows too much story.
Ain't this the 3rd time the traveler is persecuted and hunted by the governing force of a reigon
TARTAGLIA?! WHAT THE HELL?! IT'S LOOK AWESOME
I’m scared of Fontaine now
Is it just me or did this reveal trailer give yall a sense of unease within genshin's story
ADD ENDGAME CONTENT
اظيفو اللغة العربيه للعبة add arabic language to game
Finally, the nation I’ve been the most hyped for since Inazuma released. I am excited to finally venture forth through the nation of water.
I missed Childe so much!
архонт девочка на троне  гуль
Where is my Glorious Queen Arlecchino
navia's so pretty- saving for her for sure
Hopefully this region, Hoyo will finally do versions of characters (like Dan Heng and Imbibitor Lunae), and release delusion Childe. Would be really fitting seeing he's back in the story.
TF IS CHILDE DOING HERE
i love women
QUE EMOCIOOÓN
I LOVE THISS
the people saving the traveller from their archon now?
Hi
I WISH I PICKED AETHER 😭 foutaine looks so cool i cant wait!!!
Я плачу, это слишком идеально😭😭😭😭
what is neuvilette's weapon huhu
So excited for Fontaine! It seems so cool and mysterious also I’m excited to battle those enemies that waltz with each other!
Yay
Damn...childe appeared in the trailer made me want to pull him to c6... he's literally made this trailer more epic🔥
CHILLLDDEEEE
MAH BOIIIIII MAH MAAAN CHILDE IS BACK IN THE MAIN STORY QUEEEST I'M SO HAPPY AHHHHHH, Indeed one of the best suprises of this trailer!
Idk i dont feel like the trailer was as fire as the previous ones. Inazuma and Sumeru being standout for me.
wtf
that trailer has a disturbing lack of Arlecchino
CHILDEEEEEEEEE
2:23 love the helmet omgg
I knew that some fatui would show and i knew that the dude would be some kind of antagonist
Прекрасный триллер только откуда там торт вылупился
wow...
I neeeeeed to know which weapon Focalors uses
OMG I LOVE THIS SO MUCH.
OH HEY MY SWEETY TARTAGLIA
The artwork for 4.0 looks very cool, i am looking forward to explore Fontaine. I hope we will get some new traveler and main story lore and progress etc
I am very excited and can't wait for update. Seeing Childe in this trailer made me excited even more for the Fontaine..
DADDY NEUVILLETTE ❤❤❤❤
Amazing trailer!  No Arlecchino though, 0/10
WAKE UP GUYS,FONTAINE TEASER JUST DROPPED🔥🔥
i can't wait for fontaine raiden clorinde :P
So boring 4.2 arcont hydro
I'm so excited!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
Imma be playing  under the sea when i get down there with the traveler
Why the hell is Navia another Geo Claymore unit Jesus Christ
Did Lynette die?3:43
heck yeah we meet tartaglia again! I can't wait to do the quest!
...idk why but I'm starting to enjoy focalors character even more from this trailer
3:43 It’s cool that Childe’s coming back, but why do I feel like they’re already planning on offing Lynette this early in her release?
Agora quero ver vocês reclamar!
childe is mr worldwide atp
0:20 4:02 water archon spotted
I never thought I'd be happy to see Childe
Childe jumpscare?!!
Okay but Lynettes "tada~" tho
Navia is claymore user??
This seems to be living up to the hype Ive had for this nation since late Liyue/early Inazuma!!!!  Also his Lyn's weapon being a bow but the animation is him throwing cards is sick.
Tartaglia coming back after 3 years has only one meaning: REVOLUTION
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW TARTAG OMGGG
The fact that there's underwater  with no stamina is stunnin'
Focalors welcomes you in the nation of the Hydro💙💙💙💙💙💧💧🇲🇫
We're deleting everything for this one. 🔥 🔥 🔥 💯 💯
Guess we’re starting another revolution ah just like inazuma
will childe save us or something? this trailer is so cool
oh my god childe comeback
we getting darker and darker with each expansion
Navia screen time 😍😍😍  She's so pretty! My wallet my wallet! I've been saving since 2.7 for focalors amd i thought thats more than enough but now we got better and better look in every character, the more I'm starting to want them all (exept the 2 uncles)
ТАРТАЛЬЯЯЯЯЯ
The moment I saw Focalors 3D model up close, that shoe THAT DAMN SHOE yeah sorry Arlecchino but I think I want her now-
Genshin has so much potential to have a great and fun story. Shame its storytelling is so bad, and we just get lore dumped on a bunch of dialogue that no one reads, not to mention how off-course the game goes with the main campaign
Это крута
I STARTED KICKING AND GIGGLING MY FEET WHEN I SAW CHILDE
Тарталья и Арлекино А ещё капитано в Натлане 🥶
te odio mihoyo
Alright fine I’ll finish sumeru
Twisted Fate in the beginning was pretty cool.  Among other stuff as well 😅 this is going to be amazing 😁
Seeing Childe appear in Fontaine after his long stay in Inazuma is refreshing
Childe being true mr. International ✨
Freminet will have passive skill for swimming underwater 🤔 worth to pull
Damnnn........... finally something good..
I guess we can say traveller is going to be in deep water....  U get it? ~  probably cyno
I'm not a Childe stan, as a matter of fact I enjoy occasional Childe slander. But that, that got me sooooo hyped
Oh crap looks like this nation's history is somewhat lost... the hints are there about finsing its secrets.
Pode vir quente que eu estou fervendo, Fontaine
Tartaglia pulling up was my favorite part i cant wait to see this story
i really like the lynette music part ata 1:21
nice
Wait so like if Focalar dissolves everyone into water because they are guilty would that make that water bad which pollutes fountaine?
it's ya BOI CHILDEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
childe
I’ve been imagining this region for a long while, I’m excited I’ll finally get to play in the city of Justice and hydro!
mr worldwide strikes again🧒🔥
Кажется, пора возвращаться в игру
glad i stop playing this long ago. this was another disappointment.
it gives me dishonored vibes! but with brighter color
I like it
GUGHHGHGHHGHGHGHGHGHGGHG FINALYL
Bro still hold the mr worldwide title
The trailer is underwhelming tho i prefer sumeru and inazuma trailer
Guardando protogemas para la focalors 🦭🌠
Idk about you guys, but I’m definitely pulling for Lynette and, don’t hate me for this, skipping over her two brothers
one of the worst livestreams
Damnnnnnnn
Ngl I was kinda hoping they’d bring Sandrone into the mix or continue Dottore’s story, but Childe coming back as a major character of an Archon Quest is honestly a good alternative.
Tartagliaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
FINALLY, MY TIME HAS COME, MY FAVOURITE REGION, MY FAVOURITE ELEMENT AND CHARACTER I WAS WAITING FOR ..... NAVILLETE, I WILL GET YOU!!!!!
Tartaglia ? 🧐😳
Mr. WORLDWIDE IS BACK!!!!
YOOO WHY DID THEY SNAP ON THE SOUNDTRACK🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
CHILDE SHOWING UP IN MORE NATIONS LETSGOOOOOOOO
looks like water city leviathan at ff 15
The char That i really want from this Trailer is Lynette
1:46 i like this music😍🔥🔥
the hydro archon looks so pretty omg
I think that's Charlotte at 0:48
Enfin la France sera bientôt disponible. Les français vous êtes où
So from what I can gather in this trailer; we're gonna be put to trial for something. We either got caught up in a mess, our action got us into the trouble, or something of our adventure was put to trial (maybe our connection to fatui aka childe or the war n removal of elders in sumeru but only half story got out). A secret prophecy that involves the hydro archon god weeping as her people became one with the water; my theory is something or someone knew about it happening; the previous hydro god? (Remember Klee adventure park ending they talked about the formor hydro god, another god who fell just like the electro and dendro gods.) Maybe it was the previous hydro god that knew of this; did she leave clues for people to solve this? Did she ignore this? Did she look for a way to solve this on her own before but failed? The person in the darkness most likely the previous hydro archon or a victim of whats to happen. Lynette being swallowed up (pause) consumed by the water, is that what the prophecy spoke of whats to come? If some device gave out a rightful punishment with a consciousness, was it always a machine? Is that the catalyst to the destruction awaiting fontaine?  Once again we got ourselves into a bit of a fight with the justice system of fontaine but again it seems as though this is also hurting the people in a way. Is this similar to our Inazuma journey? Is the hydro god neglecting her people pain and suffering for her own enjoyment of a theatercal performance of a court battle? Or is she aware but doesnt care? Now Childe comes in to fight against the justice system in fontaine? Why is he here of all places? He disagrees, fights, is he doing it for the people? Himself? Us? Or is he simply bored with nothing to do? With his appearance here, could the fatui be here have something to do with this?  We're hyped, excited, and are prepared for this adventure. Maybe through the story we can piece together the who, what, where, when, why, how.
1:55 Could this be Albedo?
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can't wait for more story content and furnitures because I can't wait to create more teapot designs
New places to explore, new people to meet, and new idiots to beat. This place is gonna be fun.
Are we going to become fugitives again?
Please Mihoyo, all I ask is for 1 character who wears actual armor! Why is this so impossible! And don’t tell me it’s because they can’t be attractive. There are plenty of armored character designs out there that have proven otherwise. Give us some metal!  Other than that, I have no complaints. Fontaine looks pretty nice! I’m actually fairly excited to play this game for the first time in awhile.
А что случилось с линнет?
WHEN IS THE UPDATE COMING PLZ SOMEONE TELLS ME !!!!!
my phone with 64gb literally gonna explode after this update
the exact copy of the zora reign
so Focalors is even worse than Raiden well, so for me rn the best 2 archons are Zhongli and Venti :p And Nahida is just fine
I don't think I can wait even a day more!
Yknow I was really excited for this...until  I learned that it’ll be 50 GB ????!?!!!!?!
Freminet has freckles 🥹✨ and a silly little diving helmet I need him! Fontaine is gorgeous omg and the two gorgeous ladies actually foaming at the mouth I need them 🥹💜💛
Me is Childe on our side this time????
I NEED LYNETTE.
Woah Ed Sheeran is back
Inb4 Celestia nukes Fontaine and makes their presence known.
Ed sheeran meets Taylor swift lol
CHILDE AOMG HES IN THE TRAIELRRLRLRLR
Not me screaming for Childe after having benches him for 2 yrs 😅
Can't wait for the hydro traveller!!
I would be surprised to the core if childe and aether/lumine team up to bring the corrupted system of fontaine down
so 3 harbingers in one quest
yikes Lynette must be cold
❤
The fact that Foçalors actually welcomed us to Fontaine …
of course tartagles has to be here😍 it wouldn’t be genshin without him🫶🏼
BAHAHAH WHY CHİLDE İS THERE TOO
Lyney and lynette's themes got me HOOKED
Oh my god are we criminals again..
0 end game and there are still no waves to ride on our waverider 0/10
The hype is so real ive waited years for this
*Slay, Just slay*  I can smell France Even from here.
AHHH CHILDE
I love the France/Pre-Infustrial England Vibe👌.
I think it will be the most interesting and intense story so far. The characters are great. I was sure that Fontaine would have a connection with the show world, considering that it represents France.  Edit: Can Neuvillette stop looking so good? 🫰(*/ω＼*)
Mechs, mechs and more mechs. Let's gooo
wonderful
welcome to beautiful but empty locations )
O CHILDE❤️❤️❤️
Nuevillette > Childe
Dejé el juego en la 3.6, esto me convenció a retomarlo
NOOOOO LYNETTE LYNETTEEEE
Okay thats cool. Kaveh rerun when?
Mid
I have watched this at least 7 times, there are so many tiny details I’m in love ❤
With the way things are going act 1 might end with us thinking we were close and the siblings will betray us with arleccino and thats the end of the chapter
aaaaaaaahahahhahah Navia! 🤯😻💖
LYNEY KRL TU NEM CHEGOU E EU JÁ TE QUERO 🛐🛐
The bell is finally meeting its owner 😂😂😂 It's been 3 years 😂
I saw Childe and squealed
Finally I can use The Bell! Yesssssss 😂
Bruh what is Childe doing here you don’t understand how bad I panicked LIKE BROOO
Here's hoping that 4.0 will deliver more than Sumeru, better execution in both lore and exploration, more QoL, and hopefully more permanent features that the playerbase always ask.
Hmmm Navia is a Geo Claymore??
Seeing Tartaglia literally made me get up and jump with joy, I don’t even think words can describe how happy I am!!!
Oh boy, tartaglia seems to have a thing for entrances
Childe collecting them dragon men i see
Нахида, Райден и Ху Тао, думаю заспидранить все за пару часов
"Like Tears In Rain"
หรือว่าเราจะได้เล่นไชด์ธาตุสายฟ้า
We fighting god again? LET US MOVE
NOMMAESSSSS K EPICO NOMAMMEMD
SLAYYYY

This trailer made no sens to me, didnt get anything of what i was watching, the first one with arlecchino was pretty cool but this official luncher trailer was wtf + whatever, weird
finally electro childe?
cant wait to talk to NPC #34243544 for 3 hours just for 5 mins of actual good character interaction, does look cool tho.
Did lynette die? Cause i swear she just dissolved into water does this confirmed that at the mid of the story she'll die too?
I screamed tartaglia when childe showed up. My boy has returned
4:25 ARIANA WHAT YOU DOING HERE????
FOCALORS/FURINA OMGGGGG

Капец это прекрасно 😭😭😭
WHAT IS CHILDE DOING THERE HSHSHSH MY BABY CHILDE :333 <333
French revolution as a plotline, not much innovation otherwise. Seems like Star Rail is the flagship now. Oh well.
CHILLLLDDDDDEEEEEE
Childe!!???!? 😭😭😭😭😭omfg❤💗💗💗💗💗💞💗💞💗💞💗💞💞💓💗💞💗💞💗💗💗💗💞
YESSSS CHILDE WOOHOO
Has anyone else realized that Childe is missing his vision
It’s official, we’re getting arrested again
Todo muy lindo,  pero sigue siendo un juego sin Mundo Abierto donde podamos ir con 4 u 8 amigos a matar un Boss y hacer todas las misiones juntos, sin restricción de nivel de Mundo. En fin me voy a llorar a mi casa xD....    A ver el comentario de abajo que le molesta mi comentario humilde, y tonto que es si comenta ya que demuestra que el dolido es él 😂
Holly well
Freminet freckles are so cuteee 🤩
A perfect excuse for Childe (Electro) banner
Mondstat 2.0?
Everyone might be losing their memories, but this is a trailer I’ll never forget.
What an interesting place I am really looking forward to fontain than sumeru
а что если вода в фонтейне это люди которых растворила Фокалорс??
Трот хорош, как всегда.
This is an amazing trailer! I CANT believe we’re already at our fifth nation!
When I saw the animation in the beginning, I already knew this trailer was going to be good.
Is Childe the anime protagonist?
Lyney: STEP RIGHT UP! Lynette: STEP ON UP!  Me: *STEP ON ME!*
Wow I’m so excited with this new region, new story, new mechanics, lot of new chars. I wonder what might the ability of the focalor. Still not showcase yet. I contemplating if I need to draw for yelan or wait for the focalor
Porra eu sabia que nós ia ser procurado e caçado.A cada região nova mais um mandado de prisão nessa merda😂😂😂
Absolute so excited for fontaine, imma so hyped for a new character, new map, new experience, about furina and the archon quest of course!!🔥🔥
Another jaw dropping trailer 😎
When can we expect the banner for the archon
NOT FOLCALORS AND THE TRAVELER HAVING BEEF IN THE OFFICAL ART LMFAOOOO
And the traveler is once again public enemy number 1
WTF I GOT SHIVERS AGAIN
This makes me want to start playing genshin again
Tartaglia I have missed you so! 🐳🩵💙🩵💙
This nation looks amazing, way behind on story, so not gonna get to play for a while, but still very hyped. Also Foschalor (I know I spelt wrong) looks so cool.
I know what it is I just got chills
IT'S CHILDE REMATCH TIME BABY
i dont even PLAY genshin anymore i might just redownload for this 😦
so excited!! 🌊💦
Phone user get ready to cry😢
Pessoal do Genshin Impact eu tenho sugestão pra você eles são: você estão trazendo novo personagem mais com armas antiga você poderia fazer diferente trazer novo personagem com nova arma (Exemplo) personagens que usa machado, personagens que usa duas adagas, personagens que usa sabre, personagens que usa foice. você poderia mudar as missões diárias de 4 missões pra 5 missões final da recompensa diárias invés de ganhar 60 resina ganha 70 resina. Pessoal do Genshin Impact você poderia trazer Kid de Chrono Cross e Kairi de Kingdom Hearts ou mundo de Genshin assim como você fizeram com a Aloy de Horizon Zero Dawn. se você não puder fazer todos na lista façam apenas um ou dois da lista. eu agradeço vocês a equipe Desejo-lhe muito sucesso e grandes conquistas.
OMG CHILDEEEEE
Y luego andan diciendo que Genshin esta muerto
ITS OUR BOY CHILDE!!!❤Omg so happy to see him again.
another year until i reach this content ;c
Wow. Just….Wow.
Tartaglia bi boka bulaşmasa şaşırırım
Ok I was already looking forward to Fontaine, but now? Well I want to play it right now.
Nice
Ohhh so she pronounces her name (fo-se-lore) I thought it was (fal-k-rose)
Seeing Childe reminds me, I wonder if Yanfei will help us in Fontaine, since she is a lawyer after all…🤔
Hoyoverse can we finally have delusion stage 1 or 2 Childe 👉👈 pretty please
ФОКАЛОРС УРААААА
lets open some space for the new update
Childe to mihoyo is like Gojo to MAPPA.
I wish to be able to play again :(
Mr worldwide is here again
3:59 Another character that says “God” instead of “Archon!” 😂
Bet it's gonna be be better than sumeru. Sumeru was awesome. This one looks magestic
Боссы как в Persona 3
Daily reminder: this is free game.
cant wait to destroy my phone with the massive gb this update is gonna contain
Любопытно, очень любопытно.
AAAND mr.worldwide is back, so is the traveller becoming a wanted criminal in every nation & then helping solve a national crisis to become a hero again.  I've originally been really bored of GI, but I'm coming back for the fontaine archon quest
i was sur that nivia is a noble women ;)
Soooo since Fontaine is supposedly based off of France, do we get to lead another revolution? Viva la revolución?
We always are being arrested
CHILDE!!!!!!!!
Now i regret impulse pulling for ayato 😂😂 i need those extra wishes now
I need answers on why Childe was in the trailer
is it just me or does the audio sounds a bit funky
You know its serious when Gun user takes out her sword.
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
Oh yeah Fontaine is coming very soon. Cant wait to reunite Kaveh with his mother (Faranak) 😊.
Fontaine viene con todo!!! Esto es épico!!! 🤩🤩🤩
almost screamed when lynette just disappeard liek NOO NOT THE SILLY ANEMO CAT
CHILDE OMG BARK BARK MEOW EHDJWJDNJEEJ 😻
Trailer for 3.0 was better. Change my mind.
63 gb...💀     (No voicelines)
CHILDE IS BACK EVERYONE
love this
CHILDE BEING HERE MAKES IT SO MUCH MORE
So we actually have a use for the bell.
ถามจริงทำไมเราต้องเป็นตัวร้ายอีกแล้ว555555
I initially wasn’t interested in fontaine but OH MY GOD THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!!!!!!
Оооо госоподи чайлд, Тарталья ❤❤❤❤ мой самый любимый персоонаж что же будет, у меня сердце выпрыгнуло боже мой 😮🎉, это самый лучший трельер в мире! ❤
OMFGGGGGGGGGG CHILDE GONNA COME SAVE US
AHHH I'M SO EXCITED FOR FONTAINE! ALSO IS CHILDE GONNA SAVE US AGAIN?
4:00 who is she? :O
I'm calling it right now, we are gonna side with the Fatui this time around. Also, Viva la Revolucion!
Omg this trailer was so good!🔥
Well we now know how to pronounce the Hydro Archons name
4:03 gun where?
I screamed when Childe came out of no we’re.
Персонаж с именем freminet  АХАХХАХАХАХАХХААХХА
TARTAGLIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
where is arlecchino?
Truly didn't expect Childe to show up, I'm really curious as to what will happen
Ahh so it seems that one theory I read was right, the hydro archon seems less focused on justice and more in the “performance” of a court room and how fun the trial will be
WHO IS SAYING "Who am I?" OMG I WANNA KNOW!!! AND WHY IS TRAVELLER THERE! IS THAT THE REAL ARCHON AND FOCALOR IS FAKE?????
Smh looks like another archon we gotta clap and put in their place.
Foçalors ...
It’s like Childe is constantly moving between nations…not complaining tho
This is getting me hyped for 4.0 The trailer is AMAZINGGG
I was enjoying myself until Childe showed his mug. Bah.
AND CHILDE IS BACK OMGGGGG
I have a feeling childe might die in the rest of the storyline during 4.0
Everything was fire 🔥 but Child was a bit of a turn off
OMGGG IM SO EXCITEDDF AAAAA
it would be very interesting if fischl was somehow related to lyney and sibs, the phantasmogoria made me speculate
CHILDE?!?!??!!!????
I'm so happy that Tartaglia appeared, I'm really looking forward to the update 🥹💓💓💓
Опять... Ну серьёзно, в четвёртый раз гг - разыскиваемый преступник? Вам там это не надоело самим, а, Хоёвёрс?
RAAAAHHAH CHILLDDEEEEEEEE
CHILDE!! YES!!
So we are once again branded as a criminal....
lets just agree that this is the best trailer so far
Didn't expect to see childe , not complaining I love him
Not bad... Not bad... Nice job)!!!
Childe is here… damnit I thought I got away from this man 😭 ok anyway IM REALLY EXCITED FOR LYNEY AND THE OTHERS
MR WORLDWIDE IS BACK AT IT AGAIN
Hype Hype Hype
Childe coming to save us wtf
From the beautiful visuals, The stunning OSTs, breathtaking visuals, And eye catching character designs! Hoyo never fails to disappoint!! Been looking forward to Fontaine ever since the OG teaser chapter and it’s almost finally here!! I can’t wait!
Can’t wait to see what Fontaine has to offer
Surprising, i saw childe ❤
Meh. Hope its better in-game.
I CANT WAIT FOR FONTAINE DJXHJDJXJXXJ
“What’s ur favorite claymore in genshin?” “talking stick” might as well wish for it on the special rock in windrise
dammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
YOOOO somebody said “oh God” singular, is that on purpose or a mistake???
No he entrado al juego para guardar protos 😭 voy a sufrir para tener a los gemelos y al chico.  (No me puedo creer que childe haya vuelto)
EARLY
Okaay I will admit I didnt expect such a fire trailer
I MISSED MY BOY CHILDE SO MUCH
3:56 why does it look like traveller is hurt or something here🥹 and the fact that he's the only one kneeling down and paimon looks worried
I’m still in inazuma
Genshin with jazzy swing music? I did not know I needed that until now 😆
ЭТО БЫЛО НЕВЕРОЯТНО!
Перестали делать норм персонажей. Вот некоторых сделали красивыми, но дали совсем им не подходящие оружие. С таким деланием персонажей за них никто играть не будет. Удалите лучше геншин  геншин
Rewatching all nations trailer versions and watching the entrance of  fontaine reminds me damn I've been playing this game for almost 3 years now and it's still making me hype!! Can't wait for august 16th, Gonna be epic!
OMG
Unrelated to trailer, but seems like because scaramouche delete his existence, it doesnt effect much of timeline, but theres a leak saying about signora being playable or will come again, so maybe... Idk? Hoyo will try to change the story again
When release date (i the eu)
Wait that guy was using the bell
Not sure what to think about this. Absolutely burnout with this game and if this version still doesn't buff Geo element, still no skip dialogue button, unnecessarily long stories and sh1tty rng rate, im so sure to sell my account.
4:21 CHILDE IS BACK FINALLY IM SOBBING 😭😭🫶🏼✨
Finally a character that can use that dang claymore lol 😂
Wth childe??? CHIILDE u better have a good reason to be here 🧍
CHILDEE
if hoyo wont gonna release a playable chara with a long dress. they miss the opportunity
Yep, I time to farm again
FRENCH REVOLUTION LETS GOO
3:20 the way the clockworks abruptly stop right as the sentence “Why can it deliver sentences accurately?” ends gives me a chill. Makes me feel that there’s… something *inaccurate*, about the statement. Guess we’ll see when the Archon quest becomes available. The music, the choreography of the scenes, the beat drops, the dialogues and their acting by the VAs, everything about this trailer is absolutely marvelous!
Another archon to collect
Genshin impact if their community just stfu for once:
Excited I am
Once again, the Traveler is a criminal.
This is absolutely The most beautiful trailer yet, cannot wait for the nation of hydro also the way focalors welcomes us hello??? FONTAINE HYPE WOOO!!! 🌊🤩
Mumma mia
I am so happy Lynette is a 4 star, i can easily get her :)
Noooo I dont wanna c6 Bennett😭
Chidle's backkkkkk
*There's so many things to digest from this! New Archon, New Region, New Boss Fight, Childe coming back into the Story and so on....* 🔥👀
That one time I got rid of the bell I need it😭
revivió el genshin
Already far away best region 😍
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL OHH MAN I CANT WAIT FOR THIS!!
I don't think I have ever been so excited for a genshin update before  Also we are a fugitive in every nation and looks like fontaine is no different
THIS IS GONNA BE EPIC GARANTEED- JUST FROM THE TRAILER ALONE, WHOEVER MADE THIS TRAILER NEEDS TO GET A RAISE ASAP!!!
BRO WHY WE GOT INTO POLITICS AGAIN, WE JUST TRYING TO FIND OUR SISTER/BROTHER
Are you ready for French Revolution guys???🗣🗣🗣
Hello childe  long time no see
HER VOICEEEER MY NEW GAL PALLL
Yessss I really like childe
Childe is on fireeeee. Love his character design, playstyle and story sooo much. Sooo much epicness is gonna come when he will be in cinematic cutscenes. ❤❤❤
Remember when everyone was whining about not enough content? Well Fontaine is literally right around the corner and I'm here still stuck in the desert.     Send Help!
Everything in trailer is so great!! Story, Character, Scenery, CAN'T WAIT TO DIVE INTO THEM!! 🤩 Be as insignificant as it mays, I can now imagine myself glide down at every angles of that gigantic fall. 😆
another childe rerun lmao
Other people be like: new region, new characters, new story Me: bell sword canon wielder, finally
The music is TOP TIER, I can't wait for Trailers
The best nation, the best show
Thats nice but remember when you gave me c1 mona and not my wanderer? Yeah trust you will be dealt with…
So the story is kinda like a law revolution or something? 😂
Fontaine will definitely destroy me with hydroculi
I’m not happy about seeing Childe here.  Something tells me his future doesn’t hold anything good for him. Hope I’m not right though.
0:36 The Altissia that FFXV failed to provide..
Pls help me ım under the watar
They all be so fancy
why their is only one male archon
I am speechless THAT'S SOO DAMN PRETTY AND FIRE
Who blushed when lynette said “Ta daaa”
So it's like Inazuma but way harsher I guess.
Omg Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran <3
Anyone saw the bell & Iron sting in the trailer so are they Fontaine origin then
3:57 Aether is visibly hurting. Hmm....
Commenting here because I'm screaming and crying when Childe appeared. I've been maining him since day 1, the first Five Star character that I got, I missed him so much!!! I want to c6 him so badly in the next patch! 😂❤ Good to see you again, Mister Unhinged Ginger.
Fontaine would win a war against the other nations if the archon didn’t join, cuz they got guns…
No HP% sword?
I’m really happy childe is returning after quite a while I’m excited for the hydro archon and the story
childe my man I've missed you so much 😭😭
Fontaine is giving Piltover vibes from Arcane
Others: Whoaaa, so excited  for Fontaine!!!!     My potato phone/ pc: Ah crap, here we go again...
WHATS CHILDE DOING THERE
нюх-нюх-нюх. Чувствуете, пахнет Water 7.
Fontaine will be fire
WHAT IS CHILDE DOING HERE
LET'S GOOOOOO
4:06 lines about "justice, dama and blind eye etc." Is pretty much like a Marie Antoinette concept, like fr!!! I would love to know that Focalor is based on Marie Antoinette!!❤
4:06 Alright I’m calling it, this is gonna be French Revolution with focalors acting as Marie Antoinette
Para cuando permitiran los mods skin para poder jugar con mas ganas
I think childe will have the main role in Fontaine
WHAT'S.... TARTAGLIA?!
I still cant believe how Lyney and Blade (Honkai Star Rail) share the same English VA
My brain is just focused on Childe. Childe Childe Childe
ELECTRO MOMMY IS A SWORD USER YES GODDDDD
This is insanely beautiful. If it's only half as fun to play it as it's beautiful, then Fontaine will be awesome
3:57 Aether looks like he's in pain and even trembling :"(
The low ping players are gonna love this
another electro mommy LEEEETTTTTSSS GOOOOOOOOOOO!!
got a goosebump when see Childe. damn, this gonna be epic
Childe always has one of the best comebacks. He really never disappoints. Either way what is his  name this time during his rerun?😂
Keep it
Why Childe? 11 fatui harbinger and they put him again? I hope he has a good motive to be there and steal screen time for other characters otherwise i will be pissed.
will this time the path of the nation wont be able to be saved by the traveler?
Childe my babygirl ❤
It's so different than other trailers for some reason.
My storage aint surviving this masterpiece
I’m so exciting. This trailer is so interesting and it ruin everything we know about Fontain’s  subject. Even about second Harbinger who will be in hydro region I scream about 20 min after watch. Thank u, Hoyoverse
I guess childe on our side this time? We are also fighting those robots(gardemeks) of court  We have a crying furina at the start   Alright, imma wait 2 weeks faster
I dont want to mean any disrespect..  but 3.0 trailer did it better. Maybe because Sumeru OSTs feels more exotic and vibrant
Bruh i kinda need childe to be mad more often🤤
MY GIRL NAVIA IS COMING HOME WITH ME
SWITCH VERSION WHEN PAIMON? AT LEAST YOU CAN SAY ITS CANCELLED!
This will definitely be my favorite region after it's released. Sorry inazuma
I haven't played Genshin for a long time. But you know what? You got me here.
Fontaine Revolution?
No cunny no life
First, Paimon checking on Aether was so sweet 😭  Second, CHILDE CHILDE CHILDE CHILDE 🎉❤
4:38 Why the sand streaks tho? Is stealing the Sumeru desert part of the big plan to not sink?💀
I’m glad I saw childe
4:05 suddenly gives nier vibe for a sec brooooo!!! 🎉
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT FREMINET USING THE BELL? FINALLY THAT WEAPON IS GOING TO BE USEFUL!!!
I'm in love in this <3 Can't wait!
Duh hp gw kudu pembersihan memori buat wilayah baru coeg 😂😂😂
At this point hoyoverse should make child's foul legacy form playable 😭
4:29 I love you Neuvilette 76 <3
saving for focalors week 1 16 wishes 65 pity 50/50 wish me luck
childe jumpscare
Gw bingung ya nih yt Genshin ini yg khusus bahasa indo tpi kok banyak orng selain indo nya pdhal ada yg yt Genshin versi internasional nya coeg 😂😂😂😂
first reactions:  CAN WE RIDE THE HOT AIR BALLOOON WHERE TF DID CHILDE COME FROM
I literally screamed as hard as I could when I saw our beloved CHILDE
This really is all amazing! On the live, many little things will improve, which is very good. Too bad my phone won't hold up 😅🥹
Мне так понравился новый трейлер Фонтейна очень все эпично битвы завораживают и Тарталья в конце, заставили меня радоваться
WHY IS CHILDE IN FONTAINE??? IM MUCH MORE EXCITED THAN BEFORE AFTER SEEING HIM. Don'' die childe, you're my superstar
It's like liyue, inuzuma and sumeru suspense put together
Эх жаль я не дойду до фонтейна а хотелось 😢
Freminet kinda sounds like Albedo
RiP storage
Yo, Childe is back
2.0 trailer better
foçalor 😢
let's gooooooo
yep if childes in it I’m finishing my sumeru story quest rn lol
When its come?
Alright now I really wanna catch up 💀
Well there goes my entire storage
Childe!? Goddamn it, now I am hyped!
Holy hell. Now I really can’t wait for Fontiane. Such a beautiful place.
no!! not childe :(
Fontaine is about to be lit I swear
no offence to anyone but all that came into my mind was "Zhongli wanna be "
This looks absolutely phenomenal! Underwater looks so pretty and Hoyo never disappoints, they always keep increasing the levels. Childe had an amazing entrance as well lol.
After seeing the trailer I really want to reinstall Genshin and play but the moment the event preview started showing off what stupid mini games I will have to play my wish to play the game ended right there.
I think there is a secret hint in this trailer as lyney says in the beginning people who are found guilty are turn into water and in this time stamp 3:34  Lynette turned into water , she is guilty of something or what lyney said in the beginning has something to do with them and this one to 3:03 😅 it’s my theory tho I mean picture it  “ The Prophecy “ 0:05   “ who am I “ 2:52   “ the water is swallowing our memories, it won’t be long before it swallows us “ 3:01   “ Lynette Disappearance “ 3:33
fischl and focalors would be best friends fr
YES MORE TORTELLINI ACTION
its called the nation of water cause everyone has drip
The chills that went down down my spine watching this trailer cuz damn-
Childeeee!!! OMG! My boy!! ❤
Damn even childe making an appearance, this is going to be crazy af.
ISSO TA PERFEITO, ATÉ EMOCIONEI 😭😭😭😭😻
WTF JUST HAPPENS🤯
i feel like i just saw sumerus teaser yesterday yet its been a whole year now
I can't wait I wanna know what Childe is doing in Fontaine I'm o excited
THIS IS FIREEE🔥🔥🔥
TEN new 4 star weapons?  Are they finally updating the standard banner or Paimon's Bargains?  Maybe the battlepass?
And no Arlechino, huh?
I hope childe won’t end up like signora, I am praying for him. Hoyo please
Good trailer
Looking forward to in-game OSTs
Goddamm childe
Hey girlie hold still
The heavy mechanical androids and opera theme reminds me heavily of Nier: Automata, especially the opera robot with the boss music ‘A Beautiful Song’.
Theres always the Electros mega fans who kills anyone if their authority orders it. Sara will be so proud
"Don't drink the water. They put something in it to make you forget. I don't even remember how I got here."
fontain lore is so creepy and i love it i hope its gonna be dark deep and enjoyable cuz ik that in this nation alot of secrets will be revealed and im excited for it thanks mihoyo for this absolute master piece teasers be getting better and better each time, also am i the only one who thinks that enkonomiya and fontain have the same vibes idk when i saw that portal it immedialty made me think of enkonomiya
Where's Wriothesley and Sigeweine?
I dont care what trailer showed for first 4 min but when i see childe i was so ( i cant describe my emotions) . He literally said "i got my rules too " while seeing in chief justice's eyes 💀 Hee build different, but I don't want him to die here
TAR TAR TAGLIA
WELCOME TO SOUTH AFRICA!! THE LAND OF JUSTICE!!  (No seriously it is the land of justice)
My phone memory is dying😭
this update is so cool! childe was so exciting he literally came out of nowhere! so exitced to pull for lyney and lynette!
Holy France-
waos se vienen cosas epicas
Ever since Inazuma Archon Quest, Hoyoverse love to show new Harbingers in the storyline every 3rd Act of the regions, I'm pretty sure Arlecchino's entrance will be grand for a show.
CHILDE IM LITERALLY CRYING
ALRIGHTT! MR. INTERNATIONAL IS ON FONTAINE
As someone who almost stopped playing because I hated Sumeru... I'm looking forward to this.
It’s FANTASTIC ❤❤❤
Time to redownload genshin ig
Finally i can use my r25 bell
Yall caught me so off guard when THAT person showed up at the end💀   And also omg Navia is a claymore user 🥹
Date??
Omg childe 😭💘
Please Hoyoverse, make Arlecchino playable 🙏😩
WAIT, what about version 3.9??
THE MUSIC?? IT’S SO GOOD
🙏
I've read that Childe throws his water vision cuz it won't work😂
Childe red flag
Ohhhh my boy childe is comebackkkkk
Cómo siempre aether el protagonista canon del genshin apareciendo en todos los trailers oficiales
I need Electro Tartaglia!
DID CHILDE CAME TO HELP US??

Bela madrugada que vou fazer isso amor de mais esse jogo vou ama cada minuto nesse jogo meu deus coisa maravilhoso de mais meu deus estou morrendo de ansiedade de mais ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I will play this game.if you mihoyo make skip button for skipping your boring dialogue and cutscene
CHILDEEEEE
2:04 bruhh
Did anyone notice that Navia is holding either Whiteblind or Iron sting if you slow the video down? Also idk but Clorinde is giving major " enforcer " vibes like Cyno and Raiden on the clock if ya'll know
Focalors R34 incoming
Fontaine looks AWESOME and those two dancing robots were GORGEOUS I was not expecting something so cool. Also we'll get to see Childe again <3 plus all the Fontaine characters look GREAT. So looking forward to Fontaine.
ngl fontaine looks no where near as exciting as sumeru
Chúa hề childe cs enjoy cốt truyện fortine :))
pertunjukan telah dimulai wow
what is child is  doing
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY GIRLY LYNETTE OMG
Time to be the criminal once again
When tartaglia showed up again...i screamed.
I'm so so excited about it. Only a few days. Great work! Really!!! ❤❤❤
OMG CHILDE IS EHRE TO SAVE US YAAYAYSULTBEOFJW
F 64GB😢
Clorinde has no gun 😢
Im going FERAL
I see the Childe is still living up to his title of Mr. Worldwide!
Welp, nothing really crazy so far, we'll need to wait a couple patches before stuff gets interesting.
That's so cool new update with new characters !it's going to be so much funnn
Cant wait for this and the other updates to see the rest of the characters (like chiori and arleccino) especially chiori love her
Stupefying....
Genshin has the best game and game trailer/teaser indeed
I literally screamed when I saw Childe, YES TARTAGLIA CAME BACK IM SO HAPPY
hope we dont get the "albedo tragedy" in neuvilette too
Мой муж будет в Фонтейне!!! Фатуи вперёд!
Childe seriously needs a new outfit, his subordinates have more drip than he does
I feel like Freminet was supposed to be Hydro 💀
Idk if y'all are hating on freminet. HIS THEME SOLOS🔥
Welp time to start playing again after an year.
dude childe is everywhere
This is actually an interesting nation
This Will be one of best region🔥
claymore users when they see freminet: LES GOOOOO
The Bell! GUYs..The Bell!!!!🎉
Tartagliaaaaaa goddd !!!!!!
Hoyoverse can u release the electro Childe... I would love to have that
Eu só quero a minha foca🥰
It's nice to see Mr. Worldwide again in another nation
Dottore is on the air balloon/ship at the start of the trailer 😍
It would be cool if the Fatui (Childe) actually save us in Fontaine lol
1:04
NAVIA IS CLAYMORE!
Eeeeeeek can't wait for Fontaine  Nah i better buy a new device before this came 💀💀💀
So Navia's sword is inside her umbrella 😵‍💫
Looks like Fontaine is going to be the cooking pot of everything significant so far
Bruh I want that pipe prob the best weapon 😅
WE GO TO FRANCE
Imo, Focalors seems like a literal child
I CANT CANT CANT WAIT 4 FONTAINE OMG THE TRAILER WAS AWESOME (wasnt as good as sumeru's trailer but still amazing!)
i can't wait.. I CAN'T WAIT
Great trailer except childe
НЕВЕРОЯТНО!!ПРОСТО ВЕЛИКОЛЕПНО😭😭😭🛐🛐🛐🛐
Nhạc hay dữ
I dont play anymore but hype as hell about childe coming back 🥰🥰🥰 if they wanna drop electro unit childe 🔍🔍👀👀 i will probably come back for that tbh
CHILDEEEEEEEE
Fontaine has a prophecy of its' nations demise? This no doubt will come into play in the main story aside from the Traveler and Paimon's initial warm welcome of a visit taking a sudden turn to the left when a visit Lynney and Lynnette's magic show goes wrong.
CHILDE WHY TF ARE YOU HERE 💀 (I hate you but that entrance was fire)
Cant wait for Fontaine!
Once again the Traveller finds theirselfs as wanted criminals... I think Hoyoverse might have a fetish at this point
Childe's lines about arlecchino, both him and her appearing in trailers. I can sense a harbinger vs harbinger big CGI fight coming
Tartaglia YESSSS HE BACK GUYS 😫😫😫😫😫😫✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻✊🏻
Holy crap
Woahhh
BRO WHY DOES FOCALORS SOUNDS LIKE FISCHL?!
I wish the Ar system changed, we can’t just stop at 60
Bro where is Arlecchino why tf am I seeing childe again noooo
Lyney with a thigh highs. Way to go Hoyo 🙂 . Next time let’s make something more ga* please, we need to please both sides
Pog
Lyney is gonna succeed Venti as the Archon of Fembois
Ayo my boy childe let go
Меня так забавит что Чайлд, как русский перс, в каждой жопе приключений есть ахзахаха
Omg the judge is voiced by the same guy that gave Sire Denathrius his deliciously evil voice.
so no free Lynette? 😔
Nah bro Clorinde just made me straight up skip everyone untill she's available as playable 😎
my boy tartag is awesome as always😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
What da childe doing here
Omg it's the boy with the exposed thighs 1:04
I'm saving up all the primogems Все я коплю примогемы это капец👍👍👍
Bruh why is childe back 😤💀
It seems ..we know ..what happened to PAIMON …she lost her memory when we first met her …
Estou sentindo o que eu sentir em inazuma. Hyper (lágrimas de alegria)
Fate never fails to make us illegal in whatever region for whatever reason.
That is insane indeed
Childe casually being mr world wide
Yallllll I’m excited!!
i have not finish explore sumeru yettt...
I AM ACTUALLY THRILLED
Дайте мне Ху тао и Козу
It's all fountain then it's back to mister world wide as usual
I know literally everyone is talking about Childe but I have to talk about him as well XD It's so cool to see him in Fontaine and to be honest I didn't expect him to be there, it looks like he's probably there to save the Traveler (I assume since there are few people that Childe is somewhat friends with, like Yoimiya and Xinyan and lastly the Traveler which is definetely a friendship in Childe eyes while the Traveler is still slightly skeptical of him, but I feel like that will be the moment that will make the Traveler actually see Childe as someone they can trust/a friend) and if that's the case it's so cool, I can't wait to see it but it might make things worse XD  Aside from him all the other characters are so cool, I can't wait for the 3 siblings to come out, leveling them all up will be difficult though since I barely have enough for Lyney, Lynette and Freminet use the same boss materials and I'm also planning to build Childe. This is going to be hard XD  I'll prioritize Childe and Lyney first though.
Se viene Fornite!!
Why does Focalors sound like Fischl?
Im so EXCITED FOR FONTAINE😭🔥
Tbh, Sumeru had a bigger impact with its trailer
I NEED LYNEY AND FINALLY HYDRO TRAVELLER 🤩🤩😋😋
Already saved the date on my calender, can't wait!!!!!
Lame, Trailer.
It's funny how the day this trailer got released, it's currently raining a ton in France
This is the biggest red flags i've ever seen in gaming history lol now 100% sure he's gonna die its just too obvious
"But even she knows not to make an enemy of the divine" this is why Fontaine is suspiciously clean, no ruin golems, no tatarigami, no celestia nail
Mihoyo, please revamp diluc's 1st passive huhuhu
Brooo I was hoping but didn’t know it would happen! Childe is back!!!
ya era hora de alguna noticia.
T-t-t-t-t-the WHAAAAAAAAT I know we're gonna wait only 2 weeks for it but I want it NOW
TARTAGLIA??!!!
Childe really said you've got the rules and so do i
Can somebody please tell me when is the version coming out?
I don’t care what people say about Genshin but y’all gotta admit that these trailed are absolute fire bro 😍😍😍
Am i the only one who thought child said" yo have your rules and so do i" like he is rockrolling
4:19 HE'S BACK HE'S FINALLY BACK LESSGOOOOO
trailer: ok😑😑 childe appears: 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥶🥶🥶🥶🥵🥵🥶🥶🥵🥵🥶🥶😳😳😳😳🥴🥴😱😱😱😱
And again... Tartaglia is here, god he's always cool lol 😂 😌
Mid game lol
Espero que o Childe faça algo de útil em Fontaine, pois em Liuye ele quase iniciou uma nova guerra
who is the hydro archon ? dont tell me uchiha madara
MR WORLDWIIIIDDEE
IMAGING TAYLOR SWIFT FIGHTING WITH YOU
Please add arabic translation to the game we need it to enjoy when we playing.
Childe appearing in the story once again brings nostalgia. Literally. I'm the only one? Dang I guess I'm delusional
Great music. I really hope childe isnt a mainstay in the story tho. I got my "fill" of his crap in lyiue and I am just sick of him, ngl   Yes, people simp for him, I get it.

Сюжетка должна быть очень интересной
Hype !
CHILDE. MY GINGER BOY. YES.

Сюжет интереснее только в снежной и что там забыл тарталетка?
Sure, let's make Childe part of main story of lawful country but not Yanfei
EXCUSE ME ARE YOU SAYING LYNETTE DROWNED???
Looks amazing! It seems they go bigger with every update!
Геймплей Линни и Линет похожи на навыки и ульты других персонажей ещё заметила что женщина в шляпе пирата одноручница а леди в платье двурук
i swear to god childe always has a way to join in
OMG FONTAINE 🤩🎉
The traveler being a notorious wanted criminal for every nation and now for the fifth time is a classic that never gets old xD
This is amazing!  Fontaine feels so sad and dark it’s truly like it’s own drama
When will this be out😊
so Navia is Geo Claymore while Clorine is Electro Sword...
A esplorar por horas asta el último cofre❤️❤️❤️❤️

CHILDE IS BACK OMG YAAY HEHEHE  And woah is focalors a bad archon? Or is she blinded by what is going on with her ppl like raiden was… hmm
Impresionante excelentes cinemáticas felicitaciones hoyoverse
After so long they give us one new five star and another nation to save. trailer was fire but I hope they change how they tell a story, I found it repetitively boring.
We had scaramouche for flying and now finally freminet for underwater exploration!! I wonder if it's possible to grind down there... hmm??
WE GOT FRAMED BIG TIME FOR REAL GUYS
Weird, cause so far Inazuma and Sumeru has the chapter shown in Teyvat Storyline.  Inazuma - (Version 2.0) The Immovable God and The Eternal Euthymia  Sumeru - (Version 3.0) The Morn a Thousand Roses Bring   but for Fontaine instead of (Version 4.0) "The Masquerade of the Guilty" (as shown in the teyvat storyline) it's a different title.
CHIIIIIIIIILDE!!!!!!!!!!!
RIP  to potato phone like mine 💀
Аж мурашки по коже.... Трейлер имба!
I don’t play anymore but this trailer is lit 🔥
CHOLDE!!!
Me in all the trailer: well is ok 😮Tartaglia appears Me: OMG KSFJSBDISJKSHDKS
1:56 just 2 seconds, that place! 😍
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL, CANT WAITT
Childe is Mr. Worldwide official
I remember when everyone was hyped for Inazuma Trailer. We only had 3 electros back then..  Then Sumeru came. Can't believe time flies so fast and now we almost have Fontaine
OOOOH CHILDE IS HERE
finally someone that understands fischl with her: I'm Fischl Prinzessin der Verurteilung.
WELCOME TO FONTAINE EVERYONE WE FINALLY HERE
Can't believe hoyoverse made ed sheeran and taylor swift met in fontaine.
OH MY GOOOOD IMSO EXCITED BUT MY PHONE IS GONNA BE SO HOT
OMG!
Of course we become "another" most wanted list in here, it's a tradition at this point
CHILDE??
Free characters when? Free weapon when?
rip my storage. bye y'alll
What, is Childe going to help the player?  Mihoyo is really trying to make people forget that whole "trying to nuke a city full of civilians in the form of an ancient evil monster for the lolz" thing he pulled when they first introduced him.
LYNEYYYYYYY ❤❤❤
PETITION FOR CHILDE TO HAVE A 5 STAR ELECTRO DELUSION VERSION
this game is just sooo beautiful overall
I'm just here for Childe
Twinks 🤤
I don’t know if my phone can make it and I don’t want to delete genshin 😭
I was chilling and lying on my bed while watching the trailer but when childe shows up I got excited and got up
1 more year for Natlan and 2 more year for Snezhnaya, WE DOIN DIS BOIS
Sandrone why?!?!?!?!?😔🥲
So no one is going to bring up Bioshock.  I feel like an old codger having to describe it all to young whippersnappers.
04:35 Childe steps in ..... Puts on his dorky masks      PEEEEEEEEERSOOOOOOONA!
Seeing Lynette apparently getting dissolved with only her clothes remaining gave me massive Evangelion vibes
Why is Childe here? God! Take a hint, stop trying to shove Childe down our throat!
NAVIA CANT WAIT TO HAVE U 😭
This has me do hyped up right now that I wanna play this game 24/7
Is no one going to talk about the robot guards?😳
I'll finally be able to get Bennett on my AR 55 acc (yes I still don't have him)
FINALLYYYYYY TARTAGLIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who else here isn't caught up with the Sumeru storyline bc of Genshin burnout? 😭
Childe is like zorro in one piece ; always lost
Yo childe my guy this makes me want to unbench him now 😀😀
Waiting that arrlechino will be playable character or not
I was hoping to see Lumin in this trailer...
CHILDE OMMMGGOD🎉😭😭😭
Captain R IM COMING!!!
Is this gonna be another, the Archon is the problem quest lines
Fremimet sounds like rui from kny
This is not enough i need BLOOD!!!!!!
Pls second childe pullable
Navia is actually a claymore user and Chloride is a sword user.
Its like a movie... :0
Solo 12 días más.
When I saw Childe I almost screamed omg HES BACK.
FREMINETS FRECKLES T_T
Never expected Childe to come out of Nowhere ,but It was Damm surprising, ooh lord can't wait.
WHY why I am crying... It's so beautiful 🥺
Ahora sí, creo que mi celular va a explotar
Es demasiado cine 🎉
Here comes the Revolution!!!! 🇫🇷
One word. EPIC
piltover
Genshin Impact once again reinvents itself visually. The storyline also seems to take exciting new turns and twists. Can't wait to explore Fontaine. Sumeru went by really quickly
We getting there guys😂🎉
Omg childeee
Boy, the music. It's...
Finally get to see Kokomis people
THE TRAILERRRR IS SO DANG AWESOME
It has been on my bucket list to smack a jerk archon in the face REAL HARD for a long time, and now we finally have a perfect bratty one! I can't wait to do some smacking!
I want to play this game, but it's too much of a chore tbh....
And here I was, 2 weeks before fontaine wondering if I should get Kokofish. Guess she'll have to wait.
can't wait fantaine
Another day Aether being a criminal everywhere he goes
So Childe AND Arlecchino. Huh. Well, this will be interesting, but I'm always disappointed when Wanderer isn't present, so eh.
Mr. Worldwide stealing the show at the end, classic.
i feel like childe is gonna die
Genshin plot, starting archon being a villain straight away after that she become a good character in the end . Why can’t they have a better character back story, this it’s literally the same plot as raiden , boring. Why can’t be the god of justice in a good way instead, villian plot ending is just too obvious
Did the Tsaritsa ran out of operating Harbinger?? Gotta start recruiting little Timmy soon cuz Childe will soon be the new Mr. Worldwide lmao
Tartaglia...
Best one till yet.
Man.. I remember excitedly watching the 1.1 trailer🥲 time passes by mad fast
I have a feeling that Marie Antoinette's cake is in this trailer 😂
The fact that Childe play a big role again in Archon quest, I would love to see Ayaka did the same since she didn't do much on Inazuma XD (Still love her though)
SLAYYYYYYYY
Navia and Chlorine start as enemy each other then become comrade in arms near the end trailer make me jump. Fontaine gonna be epic.❤❤❤
The new weapons looks great but the effects hahahhahaha I have no opinion there might be a new character that might get released that will make those op. But the The first great Magic has a pretty good stats and effect and also the fleuve cendre ferryman is also good i will use it on my Bennett lmao. Overall im excited for everything that will happen.
NO WAYYYY TARTAGLIA CONTENT 😭🙏
Fontaine on its way to be the best region THE QUALITY LOOKS INSANE AND CHILDE COMEBACK,IM SO HYPED IVE BEEN SCREAMING FIR HOURS
Ig Tartaglia will help Aether ?
This gave me Vanitas No Carte vibes it's so majestic
Tartagila in Fontaine??😮😮😮?this is a goosebumps to me. What do you think bro
finally the bell is so yahooo
RULES..are made to be BROKEN!!!
"You got your rules, well, I got mine too!" Literally chills
Now am playing so much star rail I forget genshin I apologize 😢😢
4:25 - 4:29 For some reason this part reminded me of that one line from Batman 2022: "If you are justice, please do not lie... What is the price for your blind eye"
Wait, where is Tartaglia vision?
Childe scene gave me goosebumps
The Hydro nation with Pyro trailer
I love Navia's voice sounded like little bit La Signora or more often of it.
YEAH BOI MY PHONE CANT HANDLE THIS ANYMORE!!! YEAHH!!!
навию опять в защиту?... может харе уже михаё.
I just want my husbandoooos !!
4:30 Delusion childe banner when?
For a second i thought that girl was qiqi
WOOOOO CHILDE IS GONNA BE IN HERE LES GOOOOOOO
Wow, that was really boring.
I am excited!
MY HUSBAND IS COMINGGGGG
OMG?! IM SO EXCITED TO SEE CHILDE AGAIN
The traveller somehow get themselves hunted again.
THE NEW WEAPON DESIGN IS SO GOOD!!!
Lyney's Ultimate at 1:38 is such a beat. The cat synchronizes with it as well. Magnificent!
WHAT IS TARTAGLIA DOING IN THERE
I'm a hsr player but these trailers never fail to amaze me!
nothing's new 😂
Bruh my only thought was "He's gonna die, isn't he?".
I'm not very impressed tbh, sumeru trailer was much more convincing
Who needs yelan if you have lynette
I screamed when I saw Tartaglia
YOOOO THE CHILDE ENTRANCE
I cannot wait!
TARTAGLIA ❤❤🎉
GEO FREAKING CLAYMORE LFG
The vibes of this music is like a lot the same with The Beauty and the beast.
I CANT WAIT OMG AHHH IT LOOKS SO GOOD
CHILDEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW CHILDE, OMG EVEN MORE EXCITED FIR FONTAINE NOW
what trailer is fire but i wat Natlan
Lynette DIES???!! But since the twins are connected to Arrlechino i assume Lynnetes death was a fakeout to blame the traveler
UNDERWATER CONTENT? OMFG HYPE!
the music is just everything. i - as a steampunk enjoyer - can confirm: the outfits are absolute on fire!!!! - and the automatons. .... o no... i cant get overexcited again ^^
Очень крутой трейлер, очень жду обновления!
IM SO SO SO EXCITED ABHH IT LOOKS SO GOOD!!!!!
Its like in arcane!!
when are hoyoverse will tell us the banners
I am in love with the chief justic of fontaine
Alright, Paimon, now it's time to solve the issues in this country and ask the Archon about my missing sibling.     and don't forget to add new waifu for my collection
That man at the entire trailer, he is looking down on us🙄
Woah.
Did anyone notice focalors crying at around 0:11?
This looks absolutely insane
Hollee SHIEEEEET finally on to the next nation in 9 days!!! The hype is REAL!    Also finally the bell has an owner now it seems.
ok im waiting for Natlan now
Huh so we REALLY are dealing with a bratty Archon, with a potential boss battle against her too! Or Arlecchino. Both is fine.
Nice, Genshin got a transexuel Characters, Freminet, take that Communist Party !
Tartaglia: you know the rules, so do i
What if this is Arlecchino's plot and once again Childe becomes clown?😢
J ai tellement hâte,  surtout  l histoire semble prodigieuse . Et sans parler de l archon et de son implication,  j'ai hâte de découvrir cette région
Another highlight from Fontaine's trailer: - Clorinde is 5 star Electro sword - Navia is 5 star Geo claymore
MIHOYO PLEASE, I BEG OF U DON'T KILL MY BELOVED TARTAGLIA
OMGOMGOMG AHHH
I don't know how to describe this... It's just too masterpiece
Did I hear some Traveler Voice Acting at one Point???
Does anyone know what the music is 3:26-4:20. I did not find
Childe 😍
As a Lumine player, I better not see Aether in-game… if they can remove Stelle from the in-game artwork for Caelus players, then they should be able to do the same for Genshin.
can't wait for my pc to be on lifesupport!!!
HOLY THEY ADDED CALL OF DUTY GHOST FISH AI IN GENSHIN!!!!
m-m-man- hot man!
Esto es tan hermoso 🤩
WHERES ARLECCHINO???
ISTG CLORINDE GIVES ME RAIDEN SHOGUN VIBES
WHERE DID CHILDE COME FROM
Nice lookin update, we either getting 6 stars at some point or units from 90 to 100 !
''IM... wait... who am i?'' bro was ready for epic villain voiceline
Tartaglia really likes to keep everyone on their toes smh
FURINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  Also, Mr. Worldwide, lover of snezhnayan queen is back in the main story since 1.1
that a lot of water.
I WASNT EXPECTING CHILDE TO BE HERE!!!! WTF?!?! HE CAME BACK FOR A REMATCH!!!!  Clorinde is the combination between jean and sara
Childe entry was epic ,I got goosebumps for that and when he changes his form omg woowwww❤❤❤
Focalors in the prophecy: Sad Focalors in current story: Oui Oui Baguette
Appearance of Childe was soo epic 🔥
Childe : I’m powered up, ready for my second weekly
Huh dear God... Wired in this world should be archon
So oceanids left fontaine because the water made them lose their memories?
WTF
URRRRR RRAHHHH RAHHHHHHHHH I'M SO EXCITED IM GONNA SCREAM
AMAZING I CAN;T STOP SMILUING
Childe stepping in was so unexpected and I'm all in for it.  Woooh! Let's gooooo!!!  And the music build up and change was soo good I need the full track
Focalors is like if Fischl from the GAA actually had a Gnosis
I LOVE IT! I think I see some ideas being inspired by Houdini (Water tank trick) and obviously the French Revolution (3:56) Looking forward to seeing more of these :D  Also, out of all possible characters, I was NOT expecting Childe to appear, a welcomed surprise
CHILDE-
i lost interest when this trailer began but got it back once i saw childe
oh no.... traveller is wanted criminal again... anyways...
Mr worldwide is BACK
My boi Ajax com8ng BaCk
Oh..I’ve been pronouncing Focalors name wrong…
God yes! My boy Ajax is back!!!
I can't believe it that Childe was return i wonder why, is he on with the Traveler side or not, and also why he really needs a robot to charge it? I mean that was a thaw.
Tortellini everywhere 👌
If I see the traveler do that hand thing one more time bro... I've seen him do it at least 3 times now in archon quests and it doesn't even make sense or have any context.
Oh yeah, the Stutterer's back in action.
I can't wait till comes out next week or so
Okay but listen up   why is Tighnari talking in the start
"hello i am under de water please help me"
I hope Childe helps us with the Arlecchino boss fight 😍
One word is all I have to say...  MASTERPIECE 😭👏👏👏👏
why
It has been confirmed  💢💢💢 DAMN BRATTY ARCHON NEED CORRECTION 💢💢💢  Lynette disappearing without her clothes though, dayuuum! 🥵😏
No manches sentí escalofríos
Omgomgomg I KNOW that I will LOVE fontaine!!
What if Lynette going missing is just part of Arlecchinos plan to get rid of the traveler or something. Since she was practice with them in the teaser
4:24 I'm so happy childe is finally appearing again as a main character in the plot of a nation literally missed him too much (he's in my party ever since he got released as a playable character)
cryo catalyst when?
Childe caught me Way off guard ...makes it all the more better 🤩🤩🤩
Glory to the nation of Justice!
I don't know why but I kinda feel the death flag on childe
It's called the water nation because everyone has drip..
IVE MISSED CHILDE SM IM SO EXCITED TO SEE HIM AGAIN
AYEEE CHILDE’S BACK!
Childe gazing at Neuvellite literally saying "are your ready for some choas"
I literally screamed when I saw Childe
Childe Henshin Mode once again!  😍😍
Wtf tartaglia? Why is he there??!?😭
I love how the genshin community albeit crazy in social media and always making memes about childe looking like Ed Sheeran, they are still so hyped for him to come back. The reason i played genshin was because of lisa, the reason i stayed was for childe, even if diluc will be my top favourite childe will always be my go to character
4:07 this is so marie antoinette coded
i hope they have a cwason recipe
So excited for freminet
I can't wait....this is awesome... finally
Why neuvillette look dangerous than hydro archon?
W
Once again traveler done it and became a wanted criminal😂
Focalors sounds like Fischl
The way I freaked out when Childe popped up had my dog looking at me with concern 😂
Sosososoooo happy to see Childe again ToT
I screamed seeing Childe again
Even Tartaglia join as well?!
I remember when I visited my grandmother in village, my grandmother said, Son one day some people will waste their time reading your comment 🤔
WE ARE WANTED CRIMINALS AGAIN WOOO!
Childe appeared and I giggled like a middle school girl help
MR WORLDWIDE IS BACK BABYYYY
tf is happening my brain is not working anymore ,my pc too
It is smart of them making this Osia and pneuma mechanic exclusive to fontain characters. No matter how much characters you have, you'll need fontain characters to deal with the new enemies. I bet they will do the same with Natlan as well.
THEY ATE AND LEFT NO CRUMBS
LEETTTSSS GOOOOOOOOO
Neuvillete: This is the Nation of Justice!  Tartaglia: Hehe, Foul Legacy Form go BRRRRRR
finally after 4 damn patches, the bell has it own user
Childe is back to being Mr Worldwide!
CHILDE CAME BACK OML ❤❤❤
Here comes the party😂
WHY NOONE TOLD ME HOW FREMINETT VOICE JUST GSHSHDG
Навиллет, он слишком хорош.. А про Чайлда была очень неожиданно.
My proposed analysis of the trailer:   0:00 - 0:18 The foretold prophecy reminds me of the Third Impact from Evangelion. Where everyone became part of the human instrumentality project. I theorize that this prophecy would have every inhabitant of Fontaine turn into water the same way as in Evangelion.   2:47 The depicted scene prior to diving underwater shows a shattered city, probably Fontaine when the prophecy happens. If this scene is true, this means that Celestia (who is currently above Fontaine; per theorists), has dropped another spear (like over Dragonspine) onto Fontaine.  This makes it the second possibility / outcome of the aforementioned prophecy.   2:52  The character we see is probably an Oceanid. Some seconds later, we see Aether in the void with her. Judging from past experience, we can safely suppose that Aether has entered the Oceanid's consciousness [world]; just like with Nahida during the Sumeru Archon Quest.   3:15 Lyney mentions that the Oratrice has a consciousness of its own. Saying that it delivers a very accurate judgement at each sentencing. My theory is that Fontaine's court depends on the Oratrice for delivering each and every sentence since it started operation.  Tying this system to my previous statement, I would like to theorize that inhabiting the machine is an imprisoned Oceanid. One who's been in there for so long that she no longer remembers anything. But can only deliver a judgement at the bequest of either Focalors (Furina) or Neuvillette.  I suppose that it is up to Aether to liberate whoever was imprisoned in the Oratrice.  By the way, Oratrice is French for female speaker.   3:44 Lynette just disappears from the water tank at the same time as time stopped. It must be said that seconds ago, it started raining.   We know that Navia was surprised if not terrified when it started to rain. Note that when Fontaine was presented in all trailers (up to date), not once has it rained. Whereas in other regions, when it rained, it was a natural occurence, not a surprising one.  I don't have much to say about that, but it is open to speculation.   3:59 At this time, we can see Navia and her "Men in Black" (MIB). All of them seem to be helping / protecting the traveller from the Gardemeks (robots) and Chlorinde. What we can theorize is that they (Navia + MIB) are part of an underground organisation that are secretly acting against the current Fontaine administration.   4:03 Chlorinde uses the Iron Sting as her main weapon. Finally a 5-star (?) character that has it as a canon weapon.   4:20 Why is Childe there? What is his purpose? I can only theorize 2 things (up to interpretation):  - 1) Aether probably sent Childe a "HELP" letter and he directly came to help due to it aligning with his (Childe's) agenda.  - 2) Childe is in Fontaine because Arlecchino (The Knave) has went rogue (like Scaramouche) and he was tasked with a capture or kill mission. But so happened to get caught up in the Traveller's shenanigans (i.e. his trial).   Random side notes:   - The final trial was aimed directly at Aether judging by the timing of Lynette's disappearance and the battle with the Gardemeks.  - The trial part would mark the half-way point in the Archon Quest, where he'd go underground with Navia and the MIBs to organize a counter-attack.  - Childe seems to appear quite late in the Archon Quest. Possibly during the final missions to fight the Gardemeks and directly confront both Focalors (Furina) and Neuvillette.  - We can expect Navia and Chlorinde to be fighting each other regularly (please do not start shipping them for just this reason). So Aether would equally be involved in the fightings.  - Arlecchino has not appeared once in this trailer. Which is extremely worrying as it signifies an appearance at an unknown moment (like with Dottore).  - Btw, we haven't seen the following characters: Charlotte, Wriothesley and Siegwinne.  - In the trailer, there were some fantasy-like underground locations (villages), which could be the homes of the Mélusine people.   That will be all for now.
CHILDE
EU NÃO ACREDITO QUE NÃO MOSTRARAM AS HABILIDADES DE FOCALORS 🥺💔💔💔💔💔
Even childe pulled up to france
Finally, the time for *The Bell* has come
CHILDE THE HYDRO PRINCE 👑
Soooo I did NOT expect Childe to show up in main story again… is this where he betrays the Tsaritsa? No way… we’re not even in Natlan yet…  And it seems like Navia will be our close companion this time, as Fontaine’s Yae or Dehya. I’m excited to see more from her!! ^-^  Focalors does not disappoint. What a stunning archon, I love everything about her already.   And of course, behind the scenes of this dazzling performance, Arlecchino awaits, holding Freminet, Lyney and Lynette’s strings
Furina gives fischl vibes I love her
Childe???
Oh I am so excited! This nation is going to be so much fun to explore and learn about!
Did I see the Bell... being used for the first time?
Childe steal the show

WHY NAVIA IS NOT A MAGE THAT USES HER UMBRELLA ????????????????????
el fierro golpeador de parejas felices

3:06 this moment is so waaa just lyney choreagraphy ooo myyy goood
Well, we finally have confirmation that she's Focalors.
Why are you teasing "Character Development" HoYo, for me to expect Childe to develop and be disappointed?
lezgooo
Time to collect those fountain character 🥳 And also my sanity and wallet 🥳🥳😊🥹
childe is just the protag in this
god damnt it why the traveller treated like an international criminal ?
Bom dia, queria que viesse com suporte a controle no Android, todos os outros tem menos Android..  iOS, PS4/5, GeForce Now, Windows.. menos o Android..   Good morning, I wish it came with control support on Android, everyone else has less Android ..  iOS, PS4/5, GeForce Now, Windows... just the Android that doesn't have it...
This... Looks... Amazing...       But I can't help but feel like this is quite similar to the Inazuma plot line... I hope I'm wrong
Boring
Fantastic trailer/teaser!! I'm so excited for Fontaine!
damn the music
electro w
ZHONGLI X QIQI
У меня аж мурашки пошли! Это безупречно, но и жутко.
ayo childe you back
Arghhhhh childe is back!! I’m so excited for 4.0!
This trailer gets a 7.8/10, too much water (and no Arlecchino) (jk it looks great)
Fontaine making me wet and my wallet dry 😢😢
4:05 just hits different, I'm in love with these new enemies 🤧
Childe to the rescue? Is he going there without other Harbingers knowing or against their orders?
Tartaglia！showing some muscles in Fontaine wow🤩✨
Damn Chide gonna get some main screen time Yippe
Ok but where mommy Arle
Wait Furina is tall? i tought she was a Loli
Childe always got our back
PRETTTTTYYYY
I hope archon quest would last until the last update for this region then moving to Natlan 🥺😭❤️  the story becomes more interesting as we progress into the game. Very hyped to pull Furina and Wriothesley!!!
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL I CANT WAIT FOR IT
CHILDE..?,????!?!!? Aufghgh AETHERR OMG G EHEHEHE
the hype is real...cant wait for 16 August
All the arcons said it was daft to build a nation on the sea but I built it all the same just to show 'em it sank into the sea
Аякс мой муж🤩
OSEA SI ESTA MUY BUENO TODO PERO MI HERMANA????????????????? PA CUANDO? XD NOMAS VINE A ESTE MUNDO PARA SABER QUE CHINGADOS PASO CON LUMINE QUE ESA BRUJA DEL PRINCIPIO NOS SEPARO. REQUIERO SABER QUE LE PASO A ELLA! TODO ESTE VIAJE FUE PARA ESO!
new mommies!?!?!?!?
1:25 She had me at 'tada~'❤
Childe in Fontaine 🔥
Inazuma Trailer was shocking, Sumeru Trailer was Awe-inspiring and Now here we are at fontaine, Majestic!
WOOHOOOO!!!!
Those two dancing robots may be one of my favorite bosses ever.
Я удаляю Геншин, мои реки в Ютюбе.....
Tartaglia always on 🔥!
I am blown away by all the character designs and the gorgeous architecture and the dancing steampunk robots have me so intrigued.....but why the HECK can't the NA localization team seem to get the name pronunciations right??? First with Tartaglia (it's an Italian name, pronouncing the G is a CRIME get Fontaine's lil justice brigade on THAT why don't you?) and now "Foh-suh-lore???" Are you serious??? Since it's based on French it should be a hard C and the R wouldn't be pronounced unless an E came after it. The JPN dub managed to get the hard C right...but apparently the EN dubbing company can't even pay their VAs in a timely manner despite the money Hoyoverse gives them, so I can't exactly say I'm surprised.  And this is why I will never switch off of the original CN audio, even if I like some of the English VAs' performances.
Slay ajax ❤🔥
Justice is blind, not heartless
Im so excited for this!! But my smile turned into a frown when that STUPID GINGER SHOWED UP
IM SO EXCITED DAWGG
I got so many goosebumps! And the way my jaw dropped when I saw Childe!! I desperately need to finish up the archon quests to be ready for Fontain!! I can’t wait!!!!!
OHH so thats how to pronounce  her name Focalors. "Fosalors" i thought Fochalors 😅
OMG CHILDEE
Can't have a water World without Childe. And once again Traveller on the run.
Thanks to the previous trailer I thought Freminet is a girl... Still love him tho
So far this looks absolutely amazing
Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift!?
Pog
very excited!! but where is arlecchino?
I AM SO HYPEDDD
CHILDEE MY BABYGIRL
Ta da~
I LITERALLY SCREAMED CHILDE ?!
It doesn't rain in the cities. It never really does
I somehow knew Childe was gonna make his comeback. It's been too long since Liyue  Bro was instructed to get the Hydro gnosis and thought attacking a trial was the most fun way to do it.
this trailer has NO reason to hit this hard
Что же такого сделала гидроархонт , если Итер на заставке хочет прописать ей леща?
Just like Altissia in FF15!
Childe Everywhere in fontaine I think that mihoyo is right when they presented to him hydro vision
Me: Childe: AYOO
HYPE
we escaping court with this one!! 🗣🗣💯👍
CHILDE MY MAN OH MY GOOOOOD
IS CHILDE GONNA SAVE US AGAIN FROM BEING ARRESTED 😍‼️
I haven’t play in some time, but Fontaine storyline makes me want to come back.
When childe showed up i was like:  BOY WHAT ARE YOU DOIN ERE'
essa professia ai talvez todos os npcs de fountaine sejam eidolons
Childe gave me goosebumps
soo hyped!!
I NEED THE PURPLE GIRL RIGHT NEOW
Childe came back for… THE GNOSIS (dramatic sounds)
CHILDE😭😭😭😭
Now my phone will be rest in peace
I'm excited for Fontaine!!! Childe..... Not so much.
ТАРТАЛЬЯ, о господи, ты тоже тууууут🥺🥺😭😭
Hoyoverse never fails to bring the most unpredictable, also i like when the traveller is being chased by guards like in inazuma. That makes the story more intense instead of sumeru where u easily escape to desert
WOAHHHH THIS IS SO GOOD!!
Can't wait (still in inazuma😢😢😢)
Vuelve tartaaas 🎉🎉🎉
This archon badly needs correction. Iykwim
CHILDE!!!!
The trailer : A M A Z I N G    - 0.01 point for use of the bell
I really hope Lynette is gonna be okay 🥲
i literally have chills. thank you hoyo
OH MYYY FURINA IS SO BEAUTIFUL ❤ skipping everyone for her-
TORTELINI IS BACK!!!!
Neuvillete and Childe better throw hands in the middle of the coutroom
give me yelan, pls mihoyo don't make me lose my 50/50
Childe(my main) is badass
Извините пожалуйста а феечку в этом году можно будет получить?
ТАК ЭПИЧНО, Я АЖ ЗАКРИЧАЛА! ЭТИ БИТВЫ, И ТАРТАЛЬЯ В КОНЦЕ, ЗАСТАВИЛИ МЕНЯ КРИЧАТЬ!!🙇
SO HYPED FOR THIS UPDATE
Hold up CHILDE?
‼️ HUBBY IS IN FONTAINE ‼️ I REPEAT CHILDE IS IN FONTAINE
when hoyo drops this jazzy osts they're always fire
It seems like the story of Fontaine is going to be insane but dark at the same time. Still, im excited.
Fontaine Scenery look 🔥! Especially 1:46,   1:49, 1:53, and 1:55
MI NOVIOOO
4:05 تشبه الرايدن
Akasha system: I harvest dreams of Sumeru people!    Oratrice: Cool, I harvest memories of Fontaine people!  Seriously tho, looks like memories will play a big role thos time in fontaine.  Can't wait to come back after the AQ and understand the context
Was fortunate to watch this at Hoyofest Malaysia
childe mr.worldwide fr fr😭😭
JUST SOOO AMAZING! but Lynette(idk how to write it) die? Like i got shocked
I CAN'T BELIEVE CHILDE IS BACK. THIS IS ALREADY IS BECOMING MY BEST AND FAVORITE REGION!
4:03 this part is an absolute banger!!!
Genshin impact for life 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a thrill
Time to get pursued once again 😂
Looks like Ei gifted Fontaine with one of her puppets lmao, Chlorine-chan
The story for this region looks so good already! I'm so excited!
CHILDES ENTRANCE OMDGG
0:10 - 0:17 Thanks a lot, genius. She made everyone in her hometown run away as immigrants because of her nonsensical, whiny, control freakness.
Sin duda de todas las apariciones, me impresiono mas Tartaglia
WAIT...Freminet is a boy??????????? Thats sorccery! Even more trap then Venti
Wait excuse me? Tartaglia is returning?!
Idk if genshin will take the risk this time of a playable character dying and we'll wonder if it's still for show or they're gone for real
1:24 I love her voice sm
i had goosebumbs bro
Is that a sword version of Whiteblind that the Electro girl is holding..... Also Harbingers vs Traveler vs Fontaine.... let's see how it goes
Everyone is a gangster until the real one walks in. Childe coming to save the day always gives me chills
Damn this looks magical
Bestie Childe is back to cause more problems 😂
freminet looks badass
Omg childe daddy lets okay i am installing this game again hehehe
Cool, another childe rerun coming soon
guess whos back on genshin after 3 months
Omg! I haven’t played Genshin for awhile now. Is Childe now part of the main story quest again? Where’s the Fatui Lady? I heard she’s the villain of this arc
I'm not Brazilian , I don't speak portuguese but this trailer is fire 🔥 (although it's all about water )
Little tips : « Focalors »prononciation is ( fo / sa / lor ). The « s » is silent. In French, we have a variation of « c », here is « ç » and the prononciation is the same as a « s ». This a perfect French exception. So the correct writing is « Foçalors » !
How they gonna make Natlan better than this? By making us chug a potion of fire resistance and swim in lava?
everyone is talking about childe but no one is talking about how LYNETTE DROWNED?? 3:38
I am literally crying 😭 as I cannot play it because I am a mobile player 😢. Please hoyoverse do something about it . Please release genshin cloud for all servers
I am so excited........❤
Childe making an appearance in another archon quest??
RIP Childe
10/10 Trailer 🔥🔥🔥
Я надеюсь моя мобилка вытянет ещё один регион)
We have none in Monsdat, the 11th on Liyue (Childe), 8th in Inazuma (Signora), 6th in Sumeru (Hat Guy), hopefully we get another Weekly Boss fatui in Fontaine.
Freminet has cute freckles. He's very cute too
I honestly don’t think I like even a single one of the new playable character’s character designs at all…
“You’ve got your rules. Well I’ve got mine too.” AMAZING!!!!
🎉🎉🎉🎉 let's gooooo
Everyone childe is going to die in the fontaine
Everyone childe is going to die in the fontain
Freminet almost sounds like albedo😮
I have a feeling Childe will Die
Focalors reminds me when you give fischl a gnosis
Aint no way childe would miss out
Childe is back ?!
2:55 the traveller doesnt seem to have an element. His clothes is white
fontaine is so pretty, especially what the npc’s clothes😭😭
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I was already hyped with the trailer, but the moment CHILDE appears outtanowhere, I IMMEDIATELY SCREAMED AND JUMPED OUT OF JOY.  MR. WORDWIDE IS FINALLY HERE AGAIN OMGGGGGG ARRRRRGH I HAVE TO SAVE MORE MONEY FOR HIS (POSSIBLE) RERUN 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
OMGGGGGGG FONTAINE IS SO CLOSEEE!!   I swear to god if that clip of Tartaglia is hinting his possible death then-😭😭😭😭
BRO THE WAY I SCREAMED ‘CHILDE’ WHEN HE CAME IN 😭😭
yes! I am so excited for 4.0 😊
Childe?!?!
CHILDEEEEEE
I'm so excited!
Crazy good trailer and the music is just 10/10 AAA level. Want to listen more!
Hype total
AHHHH THE MUSIC IS SO GOOD IM SO EXCITED   ALSO CHILDE???? IS BACK?????? OMG
FREMINET I LOVE YOU
Ok, when Tartaglia appeared and transformed, I was like -OMG WILL THEY KILL TARTAGLIA!?
ТАРТАЛЬЯЯЯЯЯЯЯЯ

YO WTF HELLO CHILDE DELUSION MODE?
mr worldwide
I LGOW RHISSISI
I CANT WAIT, GENSHIN IS LITTERALY 🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
Child : i've got mine too🔥🔥🗿🗿 Let's gooooo
Thank you so much for all the effort you've put into this, Hoyo!
FREMINETS FRECKLES ARE YOU KIDDINGGGGG
Hell nah rip my phone
Siiiigh .... a Jean low cost E version , lynette ; a male fontaine Yoimiya (a bit weaker) lynley ; a Eula rip-off low cost version freminet ...  ok archon and capitan when plz ?
Good Looking Theory:We are Stars of fate The One Twin we Pick Is The star Of tortitude And Abyss sibling is Star Of Destruction Tortitude Star of fate Aka Aether Is Giving Twist for the Better I Realized that Because I mean it would be wrong for bye bye Gorgeous Taylor swift and Furrina Being only one alive Only star of tortitude is the twists But it reeks of destruction Scent with it Meaning chaos Before the Tortitude lumine The Star of Destruction Fate Is the Evil Twist for the Villains to Hide in Sight She brings Bad luck to anyone around Meaning she must spread alot of misfortune Scents around the Fontaine city It Reeks of tortitude meaning The Worst for the villains An Piece of tortitude.
Childe now has a death flag 😢  Not my babygirlie
YES, FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Tartaglia is back<333333333
AAH IDK WHY BUT I WANT LYNEY SO BAD HAHA
Ah great, we are once again a criminal
Hell yeah our boy childe is coming too.  I hope he's not getting tricked by another fatui fellow again😂
everything is so beautiful in this trailer
Yo Childe is back! 😁
I love how Childe yell
LITERALLY SO EXCITED
Venice Italy on steroids
Very interesting. These gardemeks are gorgeous in design when it comes to enemies. Also the line "do you think ots right to treat a trial like its an opera" sums up exactly what we can expect to be a major issue in Fontaine. Furina craves entertainment that being she wants more trials to take place; what's saying that little pink character that showed in the teaser won't stage a show to convict innocent ls to keep Furina entertained. Eventually what pleases Focalors the most will end up being her downfall according to the prophecy. Also freminets helmet is so charming
Rain in the city?
Hello tartar sauce
why do we keep becoming a wanted crimnal?
those guards wearing tuxedo and using a sword just doesn't fit together 😂 where's the Guns fontain
Trailer is interesting, I hope the new artifacts will be good. Looking forward to more lore bombs!
I can only wish that Yanfei could help us out
LINEY YOU WILL BE MINEEEE
My baby appeared oooooowwwwwn, hurt him and I drop it 💕
There you go! The Bell user!
hyppe lets go!
I've been dying to play this region since I started playing, and by all appearances, it won't disappoint.  I hope the writing team was as passionate about this region as they were the last.
IM GON LIVE AND GON LAUGH AND LOVE CHILDE TOO ‼️‼️⁉️⁉️
will Childe vs Arlechinno??
It's ya boi childe!!!!!!
Man, seeing this trailer really want make me to delete Honkai impact 3rd and download Genshin again in my phone. This is a hard choice.
Fontain is officially my fav region
Childe's entry is the best i think he probably came to save traveller sent by a certain someone too at that
Mad respect to Chiilde for the return🔥
my boy childeeeee
I can't wait to meet the pyro archon finally she's coming
I am confuse is Childe the main character or us?
Im planting my flag here right now that the quest and the archon quest is just Ace Attorney mixed with a Persona and Aquaman
Jep.... jep... I do love this game❤
Tartaglia 🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
Okay but wtf is going on with the traveler, why's he bugging back there
Why does it feel like Tart has a death flag looming over him very prominently right now....
Очень жду 😭
AHH IM SK EXCITED!!! EVERYONE LOOKS SO COOL!!!
FUURINAAAAAAA
And also, welcome back to the storyline, Tartaglia!
Leave it to the harbingers to make an otherwise trite story an interesting one :))). I can’t wait to see what Childe and Arlecchino bring to Fontaine :DDD
FONTAINE I’M COMING!!!!!
Oh, crap. Tartaglia is involved. Looks like I will need to come back and see that.
I swear the traveler is always wanted in each region.
Точно не понял но там должно быт из за много воды вся город утопиться в море как сказал Фреминет если помните хочу видеть как всё будет музеем подводной или как но было похоже не помню точно
What the childe doing?
🔥🔥🔥
ЧТОО
Ive never felt so hyped for an Archon since Zhongli (and yes, while Raiden's entrance is really epic, her design is mid)
Woooo
What da childe doing?? 😂😂
CHILDE!!!!!!!!!!!!
ay, me devolvieron el hype por Fontaine!!!!
What is Childe doing there 😂
Great trailer!!! I can't bear to see the fontaine , 'to the finale'!!
As expected of genshin, it won't disappoint us (except in primos and 50/50 loses ) ..
Ayo childe better come and rescue us
Three new characters, all interesting, none I want. Gotta wait for a few more updates I guess.
Cool
I got goosebumps. AAAAAAAAA I CANT WAIT I KNOW FONTAINE IS GONNA BE AMAZING!!!
Paimon : Childe's the one behind all this? Ugh not him again!
Tortilla the 11th of the fanta hamburgers strikes again!🔥
Is it just me or does the judge have a baby face?
4:25 goddammit pls made a pt 2 of his story quest like the one you did with yoimaya
@3:59 So Taylor Swift is a claymore user? I really hope she wasn't T^T.
It looks amazing I love childe in this I’m happy they brought him back but I know this is not what the gameplay is gonna look like
Fontaine looks absolutely gorgeous, I can’t wait!!
I've been waiting for fontaine since I started playing, I'm in shock😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
WHY NAVİA İS A CLAYMORE T_T
I came
now just what the hell is childe doin here😭
Spoilers:           WTF IS AJAX DOING HERE?!
this has to be one of the best nations in teyvat
Карточный челик, кошка, фрик, тарталетка и... оперный театр? это будет худшее дополнение.
Did i saw harley from mobile legends
Deep lore lets go
So all the videos are now on wider ratio ..
bell
Why is the hypest part when an older character shows up 😅
What does Child a Fontaine do?
First the honarary Knight, then the Hero of Lyue, then Destroyer of eternaty in Inazuma, the 1. Sage of Bour in Sumeru and now the supreme Judge of Fontain?
Maaaaaaaaiiiiiiiii GAWWWWDDDDD  It's getting DARKERRRRR😱😱😱
Tartaglia entry in Fontaine really gave me goosebumps. Didn't expect that coming.
man i really gotta finish the sumeru quest 😭
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH ITSS CHILDE
Aun no estoy ni por la mutad de sumeru 😢
что за заворушка
Childe's a true homie alright, this will be the second time he'll save us
Keren tampilan senjatanya, unik lagi
Fosalor??? What? Why did she pronounce it so weird?
手游界也只有原神才能超越原神
Child came out of nowhere, and Traveler will be like we dont know that person. He's not with us.
I want to switch mc , can i be childe🥹
why the hell is childe in fontaine
Increíble, Hoyoverse siempre trayendo buen contenido a la historia principal, por las pocas cosas que aún sigo en el genshin, casi 3 años y espero poder seguir hasta el final, gracias por todo
I saw furina in the thumbnail and got to check it out
I'm always hyped when Childe appears
My boy Aether not having a good time. 😒
It’s been a long time since the release of Inazuma and Sumeru! It’s time to go to Fontaine next! Let’s go!
CHILDE RETURNS!!!
I always pronounced the c in Focalor as a k, but I just realised It's pronounced as a s
OMG freminet actually using the bell. ngl i thought it was a joke in his art
4:31 Oh lawd he's back
DAM DAM DAM DAM DAM DAM DAM DAM DAM DAM DAM DAM DAM ......... Now I don't think I will be able to wait anymore 😭
So Fontaine is the faucet and Watatsumi Island is the drain.
WHAT A JOKE :v
Childe following us everywhere at this point
Hydro archon is mine
Can't wait to use my Dendro character 💀. Sea monster will be extinct.
So that's how her name is pronounced 😅  Ç
Me: damn this version is fire  also my phone: 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Tartaglia YES
OMG WAS THAT CHILDE FUTFIYGIYDDTFTYE
NEUVILLETTE MMREOOOWW OHH MY GOD 😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍‼️‼️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔛🔝‼️💯💯🔥🔥
Childe coming back to commit more war crimes lol
SICK OMG IM ACTUALLY EXCITED
I’m pretty happy that I have an ok build for my Childe…
Idk about y’all,but I’m glad Childe is returning😃
"The water is gradually swallowing our memories..it won't be long before it swallows us, too."  LITERALLY GAVE ME CHILLS UP MY SPINE
I see chlorinde wielding a sword
Omg Freminet has freckles
CHILDEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Childe got me hyped
This looks so good but the way she pronounces Focalors pushes a rusty pin into the part of my brain that remembers taking French classes as a freshman
I would spin for lynette
I cant wait to feel the urge to beat up focalores in the next update
тарталье не хватило ли юэ, пошел громить фонтейн
Что там забыл Чайльд
haven't done sumeru yet but so excited for fontaine wooo
Это было… просто великолепно, жду не дождусь Фонтейна. Уверена что сюжетка будет супер интересная. А когда выскочил Тарталья?! Как же я рада что выбила его заранее
Ei: i am the problem of my country.  Focalor: honey, i'm about to take that statement and ramp it up to eleven.
omg childe!!!! he always has such cool entrances
Can't wait to see my favorite boi Childe again
Oh wow Lynette's skill looks just like yelan's
Are those underwater levels? My favorite! I can't wait to ignore them -.-
I just realized that the Traveler spoke when Lynette dissolved.
Is the one ask:"Who am I?" the previous archon?
Incredible, HoYo, just as always
Lyney = Step right up!  Lynette = Step on up!   SIBLINGS Y'ALL
MR. WORLD WIDE IS BACK BAYBEEEEEEEEEEE
MR WORLDWIDE BACK AT IT AGAIN
It's so weird how Focalors doesn't feel like Fontaine's "real" Archon... it seems to be Neuvillette and I'm so excited to find out who he really is.
CoCoMee supremacy!!!
You don't know how much! I FRICKING SCREAMED AND PANICKED AND FANGIRLED OVER ALL THE CHARACTERSS!?!? LIKE EXCUSEE MEE😳😳
Focalor looked so lonely at the beginning when it was said that everyone in Fontaine will dissolve into water as she stays by herself god I love this.
His death looms, Childe's time to shine. (I hope not, but it's a possibility)
I dont think anyone has seen or talked about this But a geo claymore and an electro general having a rivalry?       *DEJA VU* *I HAVE BEEN TO DIS PLACE BEFORE*
CHILDE IS BACK AT THE FOREFRONT! ❤️
you're as beautiful as the day i lost you
Ahhh fontaine story kinna similar with inazuma. It will become inazuma 2.0?
CHILDE COME BACK YES
exploding from excitement
Childe is gonna come back for a rematch i think-
No villains in Fontaine? Yeah, they'll make us the villain 😼
Childe and arlecchino gonna destroy fontaine
YOO CHILDE IS BACK
Focalors ❤ ❤❤ shes so cutteeee
They are actually going to KILL a character in the game???
Am I the only one who’s worrying about my phone storage💀💀💀
4:08 Ah...I really want to see the show it's very fun and Ice-cold.
Avsolute hype🔥🔥🔥
Nice😅
I feel like Childe is one of the few characters that actually has a good story and personality. The part that got me the most excited was seeing him in the new region lmao
finally our Mr Worldwide is back
CHILDEEE MY BABY I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH
Almost made me play again 😈🚬
bring back dainsleif and abyss sibling please
Предвкушаю разочарование
Wowww KEREN. Jadi pengen KUMBEK
AHHH I WAS EARLY ON LIVE AND EARLY ON THE TEASER EEEKKK
Idk why but Fontaine js feels so nostalgic for me..
IF CHILDE IS HERE THEN THIS ARCHON WUEST WILL BE A BANGED😍😍😍😍
CHIIILLDDEEE😭 MY BABY BOY IS BACCKKKKK 😭😭😭
HYPE 🔥🔥🔥
did I just saw torteleni?
Finally Childe is participating in this  story or probably archon quest. Is traveller teaming up with him and navia? Im so excited!
When everyone was ready to fight, as a Mexican, I was like: hoo hoo hoo..... QUE SE ARMEN LOS PINCHES CHINGADASOS!! **bang**  I really really need my soldiers combat ready!!
So you are saying, we have to find Naked Lynette in this update??! Ohh soo coo... I mean, I already have completed so many quests, so I will complete this one for you as well... ....😁😁🥰😁😁
So Traveler becomes a wanted person again? 😂
NAVIAS CLAYMOREE
Finally tartaglia will have his well deserved screen time.
Definitely pulling for the blonde (not aether) her character model looks so cool.
Luv u genshin ❤️❤️
Childe back in story? I guess i can finally be somewhat excited for the new story
Wasn't version 2 point something the other day..? Like.. we're in 4 already.. it's 2023.. time is going so fast and this is just getting more and more exciting for mee. 🎮🎧🌷✨
Banger trailer
Is it just me who feels like childe is gonna die sometime in the story…
I literally shed a tear here because of the beauty of this trailer
AHHHHHH HHHYYYPEEEE
I literally started playing Genshin yesterday and now I'm SO excited!!!!!
I AM MOST EXCITED WITH CHILDE AHHH!!! <3 <3 <3
Everyone excited for Version 4.0?  I know I am. 😎
NEW TRAILER 40 MINS AGOO??/ wow I'm happy
1:25  Ta-da
Can't wait, been wanting to explore Fontaine in years
So whatt i got from this trailer is that Fontaine is gonna be an ABSOLUTE BANGER!
I can tell I’m going to have work 20X harder for these characters 😞. They all look really good though!     I’ll be honest I didn’t know Freminet was male 💀
looks so good!!! very excited to see my boy tartaglia chlide again, i wanna see him do some villainy ♥
аааааа, тартальяяяя
well childe have unfinished business with fontaine..
Childe gonna be our savior again??... 🎉
Welp guess they just blew my expectations out of the water (no pun intended), again. The City is beautiful, the music is beautiful, the story is looking beautiful, and the QoL updates, beautiful. My hype is renewed once again lol, must be an annual thing.
Hoyoverse with the W again🗿
Real
This is gonna be epic-
If you can pronounce epicles as epikles you can do the same to Focalors. Sounds disgusting as Fosalors.
боже, почему так красиво
Idk if there’s anyone worrying about Lynette, but remember what Arleccino said : “Good actors hone their crafts to mesmerize the whole crowd”.
If one of the dishes we can cook isn't a baguette I would riot.
Nice new weapons 😆 Hold up is that a pipe..💀
1:20 that "tadaa" kills me
4.19 ура там гидро архонт
Anyone else think Freminet sounds like Albedo?? 😮
Their archon gives off himedere vibes, love it! so much stuff to be excited about. Totally pulling for the pretty blonde lady and the pretty gun lady, they're so cool ugh.. 💗💗 And wait– the guards surrounding the traveller and blonde lady looks like ppl from men in black lol.  I love hoyoverse's story building so im rlly excited to know more abt fontaine's world and conflict that traveller will face this time.
Really didn't expect Childe to be here 😮
where is charlotte🥲🥲
We're gonna see Childe again! Let's go, Chilumi!
If you guys didn't know, it not supposed to rain inside city's
CHILDE!!!!!!!
2:58 Atomic Heart intensifies
I CAN'T WAIT
those dancing robots look like such a cool boss to fight, a real needed change!
My boy Tartaglia!!!
OMG OMG OMG THIS IS MY HUSBAND
👏🏻👏🏻
I cannot wait omg and I got to see part of the livestream irl at hoyofest it was really cool >:OOO
ребят а когда сам фонтейн то выйдет..
Oh oh,the bell claymore!! Finally found the origin for jt
The Mega Meka Melee even reminds me of Super Mario galaxy.
New archon give vibe like Marie Antoinette all is metter is fun and theatric not ppl
oh so good
The fact that Childe shows up officially after such a long time in and on itself makes this nation just ten times better.
excited about Childes part in the main story. He is such a interesting Character with his morally grey actions.
Я все видео: воу воууу вооооу и ПФФФФФФФ ЧАЙЛД ТЫ ЧЕ ТУТ ЗАБЫЛ. ну оке чел гидро все-таки. интересно что выйдет. и я супер рада за тех стимпанковских танцующих роботов. прям то что я ждала. спасибо
There are literally 5 weapon type in Genshin but when it comes to Geo only claymore exists
Exicted to see how the story will turn out this time seriously though of all things i didn't Mr.Wordwide himself to make a return
Maybe, its focalor turns fontaine people to mechas
I WAS RIGHT TO LOOK FORWARD TO FONTAINE FROM THE BEGINNING
Furina/Focalors is giving me Fischl vibes somehow. I think they would be perfect duo
Let’s see if my iPhone can handle Fontaine 😂
Ну пойдет, че
YEAH CHILDE COMEBACK LESGOOOOO🗣️‼️‼️‼️
French players is our time to shine.
I am now gaing to save for Focalors bc JUST LOOK AT HER!!! Shes a little yae miko but blue!!!
4:21 I halfway expected to hear a "Hey girlie~"
Mr worldwide strikes again 😂

Waiting this week and a half is going to be painful lol.
I feel like a Disney characters rn
I'm going to get Lyney
Childe may have appear in the trailer, but you know what's gonna appear? Childe's death theories updating.
Childe please help! I'm a wanted criminal! AGAIN

Time to contact YanFei
Im I the only one who noticed something at 4:39 ?! Like WHY?!?! did they change the style?! . When Inazuma and Sumeru's Trailers came out, the ending/outro have been just the name of the update and a dark background with the theme of the region and element. And now it's just normal... . I love the art I really do, but I prefer the old ones...
GOOSEBUMPS ONCE finally we got another part of the story
Everything was good in trailer but where the climax  something to look forward too.
LYNEY IS SO SO SO 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Bro did Lynette just disappear out of nowhere?
Childe in action.....it seems he will get a re-run banner in this 4.0?
What the children doing
Saingan keqing ayaka nilou bukan maen kali ini cok si archon fruina new sword teen user😂
yes. amazing. better than any movie trailer ever.
Hope Childe won't die
The music reminds me of Yelan's them my gosh! I love it! 🎶😍
CHILDE BABYGIRL 👍
PLS DONT MAKE IT UNPLAYABLE FOR MOBILE PLAYERS I ONLY HAVE 6 GB AVAILABLE
Tartaglia🎉🎉
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS (except childe i am having my fingers crossed that he dies in this archon quest!!!!!!)
Can we all appreciate Hoyoverse for their amazing teasers?? Like this is pretty much where stuff gets real serious, the music, Childe's appearance, especially the voice acting? It's a literal masterpiece!
Mr. Worldwide
To me, since 1.1, Tartaglia was, is and ALWAYS will be the coolest character in this game!
Oh god i hope childe isnt gonna die esp how hes using the delusion again 😭
At 0:35 it looks like the entrance in Altissia in FFXV
CHILDEEEE I CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU
CHILDE ❤❤ I knew that a Fatui with a Hydro Vision was needed here 🔥🔥 And Foçalors is already my Favorite Archon 🥰💧
OMG I recently started Genshin and I’m loving it just finished the sumeru archon quest I can’t wait for Fontaine! 😆😆
Bro no way Childe got the power up to fight Fontaine, and, idk why, but he has had the best entrance in this trailer😂
I kind off think that Fontaine will be the start of where characters die
OMGGGG Childe !
Ok this deserves my return to genshin
AHHHH FOCALORS OMG
Its so pretty!!
navia claymore, itto power creep? clorinde on iron sting why? also WHERE'S ARLECHINO 😑😑😑😵😵
Maybe Childe's there to get some parts for Teucer's toys.  And those dancing machines! They're so elegant!
I was hoping for the french revolution in Fontaine but this is okay
I can't get enough of freminet theme it's Just chef's kiss 🤌🏼
I WAS SO CAUGHT OFF GUARD WHEN I SAW CHILDE OMLL I ALMOST SCREAMED  im soo happy abd surprised to see him in fontaine i cant wait for the story and i wonder why he is even there?? so many questions but im SO EXCITED
CHILDE JUMPSCARE
Fontaine : "Machine is the problem."
Why do I feel that Focalors' style of speech seems a bit arrogant? And cold laws? So i guess the story will be about revolution
I can’t be the only one who thought it was pronounced “fo-ka-lor” 😅
no seelies??
WOO! So excited!
childe being a part of the main story again literally made me scream i was not expecting him to show up IM SO EXCITED FOR FONTAINE 😭😭
LYNETTE NOOO!!
I might just come back to play the archon quest
Well...Well ....so many things showed up in the video and I'm so excited about it all. But I won't deny that I screamed at the part where Tartaglia appeared...my boy(⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠)
WHAT HAPPENS TO LYNETTE WHAT DOES HAPPEN TO HER I NEED TO KNOW
Holly molly, he is actually using the sword of time xD
Okay, Hoyo did not have to go so hard with the vibe, the music, the visual, the voice acting, I'm obsessed
POV: you joined the live 28 minutes ago.
3:00 reminds me of Simone from Nier Automata. Glad this one has a partner lol
Я РОДИЛА..ТАРТАЛЬЯ
The French Revolution is here, ah yes traveller and childe duo is back again.
CHILDE MY BABY IS BACK IM SO HAPPY
Please Add controller system
I really hope Hoyo doesn’t give Furina crapy development like they did with Ei and it seems Navia is Claymore user and not Catalyst which looks odd on her but perhaps she’s part of the rebellion.
this is going to be so incredibly cool i can’t wait!! the questline looks like it’s gonna be the best one yet
CLORINDE
I'm watching this trailer seriously but then the pipe sword got me 😂
Arlechinno isnt even in the trailer, and i know im not the only one that thinks this dosnt live up to 3.0 trailer, but remember this archon quest is in 3 parts, not two. The next two are going to be even crazier.
Its giving chills and excitement *cheff 😘🤌
And once again, Hoyoverse never failed us to introduce another nation of teyvat👏
So many maps to farm make it easier to see chests
Lyney and Lynette's intro music is fire 🔥🔥
If childe uses the foul legacy transformation again I will finally have a shower and when I do I will turn the temperature up to max because his lack of braincells makes my braincells hurt.
TARTAGLIA!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?!!
I hope this new archon quest will not be extremely confusing...sumeru archon quest had make me dead confuse (in a good way) with the plot of the story😂
📱: bang udah bang😭
4:06 This dance and their designs look awesome.
Congratulations, Hoyoverse! You've hyped me up more than I could possibly imagine. Touché...
4.1 leaks right around the corner 😏
Tartaglia is amazing. I hope Zhongli meet Tartaglia
Focalors is going to pull a Cocolia on us. First welcome us and then try to imprison us
4:20 Mr worldwide in action
FOCALOR GORGEOUS
LYNEY OMGGGGG
somebody explain to me how does hanabi network uploaded this before the official genshin impact
FREMINET HAS FRECKLES!!!  And you know it's getting serious when Aether starts speaking,, Dear god
I hope Aether and Childe will team up for this
I nearly forgot Childe is a hydro Character, Our Comrade is FIRE
Holy flip, everything looks so cool and beautiful,very interested too see what's going to happen in Fontaine Especially the moment 2:52 is very intriguing, who is this?some oceanid?Or something more mysterious?Very exciting
Let's goooooooo
CHILDE !!!!!!!!!
CHILDE?!!!
Why does Traveller has to be arressted in every fcking countries? 💀
last year when I started playing genshin imapact and I did the storm terror quest. The part where you fly and shoot at Dvalin, he's actually flying near Fontaine. I always wondered where those moutains were from
Где арлекина? 👿
My speculation for this is as follow We would prob meet focalor first thing when we arrive with the anticipation of our reputation of a traveler seeking the gods We would make friend with golden girl who prob has great reputation of their own or something since she has bodyguard Theres a robot conscious in the court which prob is connected to the fading memories of the citizens  The prophecy might mean that the entire nation would be foun guilty of something while focalor would be the innocent and play victim? Idk this is just ranting bs
Justheretobeearlybutimwatchinfthistomorrow
they’ve seriously improved since the inazuma era
Tartaglia is soooo amazing! Can't wait for Fontaine only because of him.
OH THIS IS SICK AND WHEN CHILDE SHOWS UP IM SCREAMING
No joke when Lynette dissapeared it scared me
The underwater looks so so beautiful in this game 🥺🥺
Ayyy Childe, nice entrance!
CHILDE USING HIS DELUSION I AM GOING INSANE
Im so excited!
THE WAY CHILDE CAMEE- i started screaming.  YAS MY BOY IS COMIN BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK WOOOOOOOOO
Childe is back!!
Childe is basically ichigo.
I wonder if I will be able to see the end of this game before I die XD
The first line. 0.0  It may be true that celestia location is above fontaine and it does observe them. If they become too advanced, they may be like Khaenreah. So furina/focalors establish such laws to put the nation under control. The rising of the waters maybe her problem. The fatui and their conquest of her gnosis might be the foul play about the prophecy and the nation's dilemma.
From this we can tell there is a childe rerun again...
OMG OMG OMG OMG
The more I watch it, the more it looks like Lyney sacrificed his sister in that scene, for the sake of Fontaine's secrets, related to water.  perhaps Lynette loses her memories..or hopefully dies since Genshin needs drama and character development
im waiting for some art at danbooru after this update
omg i think im in love
0:40 what the f kind of question is that? A person's life and future hangs in the balance, and you're treating it like it's some kind of exciting performance put up for your amuzement? I can already tell I won't like this nation
Tartaglia came in HOT!
4:20 Childe's vision is missing, is that why he's using his Delusion to fight here?
My God childe is everywhere at this point mr world wide fr fr
I've been playing Genshin for a year and I'm never been this excited for a new nation in my life, Hoyoverse really knows stuff in order to make us hype.
Focalors pronounced her name here in french = FO-SA-LOR (last S is silent).
MC: Childe ????? Are you sure you not follow me  Childe: im sure!!! - Continuously appear in everywhere after liyue
4:19 IM CREAMING WHAT IS HE DOING HERE THIS IS CRAZY
04:15  Navia is a Geo Claymore. She uses Whiteblind, so there is a chance she will be defense scaling.
EARLY EARLY EARLY EARLY EARLY EARLY EARLY EARLY
Arlechino where
7.8/10 Too much water
опять государственный переворот в регионе, когда мы там появляемся....
2:28 damn that looks real
oh my goshhhhh my childe i'm waiting for this !!!!
i think we can finally get some good quality story?
I can't wait for Fontaine!! And my boy Childe coming back too, I've been preparing for this!! 🤩🥳
Тарталья - суету навести охота
Thank you for everything but What about add languge Arabic 🥲😞?
By the looks of it are we getting our first playable character death? 3:47
Everything would be fine, but these stupid boring events for children at the end...
I'll wait for the archon quest, pls be good.
I like how child always pops out of nowhere
Childe's entry made me got the chills
Once again Childe reclaims his position as Mr. Worldwide
look at those all weapon too bad i never pull in weapon banner :(
WHEN I TELL YOU I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW CHILDE
Hype for childe!!! also is it just me or his hydro vision was hidden in the trailer? we also never learned how he got a hydro vision(only playable character where we don't know source of their elemental power)... hmmm
Gotta give it to Childe to find his way to the main plot anyhow.
YOO ANOTHER ARCHON WITH A VILLAIN ARC? LETS GO!!  Her voice sounds IDENTICAL to fischls voice, and as a fischl main, I see this as an absolute win!
Come on, we're bored of Childe. Give us another Harbinger.
CHILDE???
No matter how dirty the sea water this trailer is clean 🌬️🌊
0:30 already she sounds like a CEO. Greeeat
definitely wasn't expecting Childe to be here
Finally, the nation with the actual rain in their main city
Childe is back in the buisness
Well well wellll....looks like it's time to solve yet another nation's problem by throwing traveler under the aquabus Bravo
When it s coming please ?
I just notice that at 3:43 Lynette turned into water...  Furina, why did u do this :c
Если под водой мы не будем охотиться на утопцев с помощью арбалета, то переделывайте.
Childe, childe and childe... My second in command after Diluc... Don't enter like that, or you will lose again like Liyue. 😂
CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS!! GOOD LUCK TO ALL THE PEOPLE PULLING FOR THE NEW UPCOMING BANNERS!!
ZHOOONGLIIIIIIIII
This is so hype 🔥🔥🔥  Please let childe get humbled by the judge or the archon bro is too arrogant and overrated
Childe returning to the story is probably going to be the only interesting part about this update.  This trailer was honestly just kinda meh.
See y'all in Fontaine ♡
TARTAGLIAAA
CHILDE!?!??!?!
That scene of the two mekas dancing with epic opera music in the background gives chills
Excited for more reveal about fontainne
Alright, everybody calm down!
I'm so excited for the twins-magicians, they have such great energy! Not to mention the new archon, and this mysterious lady in yellow, and her mafia, that seems to be helping the Traveller? What's that story about?
Free benny wow
Focalor Vs Childe lezgoo show who's the boss Furina 🤣🍷
childe jumpscare
Чайлд, мой мальчик 😭❤
уиии фантейм
childe my man always got the spot i love child so much
The whole trailer is amazing but as Childe main, seeing Childe made me jump from my chair. Nice seeing you again Mr. Worldwide
me throughout the entire trailer: eh doesnt look too interesting, i’ll probably not even update the game also me: *sees childe* i will be playing.
I absolutely did NOT expect Childe in fontaine, so excited to see him again!!
I had a feeling we're going to fight the hydro archon  And also the "law"
From this trailers, I got a feeling that focalor is far worse at governing people compared to other archon we meet so far. Even worse than ei
CHILDE
У меня скоро компьютер взорвется от таких обновлений...😭😭
why do i have this nagging feeling childe is going to die
never thought the most exciting part of a whole new region will be seeing child back in the archon quest hype
tis good but sumeru's 1st trailer still is crazier. can't wait to get focalors and c7 qiqi
childe carried the whole trailer
YEAAAAAAAAAA
Vive la Révolution!
у меня че места на телефоне доxyя😭😭😭
i am so so so happy childe is in this archon quest!! i have been dying to see this ginger in a main quest for a while now
у меня че места на телефоне доxyя😭😭😭
Mr Wolrdwide come to rescue...👍
Man Tartaglia, cool as always
The Goat Childe is back.
AAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!! CHILDE STOP CHASING US FROM EVERY NATIOM
When genshin became automata....
Wait i got really scared, what happened to Lynette?! 😭
O COMEBACK FODASTICO DO CHILDE MANO ⁉️⁉️
Another immature childish archon who doesnt know a thing about anything AND Another nation of Aether getting violated because of NO reason or a misunderstanding foolish important character
childe is going to die isn’t he
FONTAINE IS SO PRETTY
Welcome to the Land of Justice and Judgement.
I am so intrigued!! And as always, Childe has an iconic entry!
It's laughable how Children think he's better than those on fountaine when he and his cronies are bunches of people that are destroying other people's lives without any remorse.
Super Sayian Targatlia!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
C'est beaaaaaau !
A FLYING SHIP— WILL WE BE ABLE TO GET ON IT? THAT BIG WATERFALL LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL  Lyney and Lynette's part is so well made and smooth!!   The environment each nations gets more and more  prettier as they get released, I'm so excited for the underwater exploration!  Also DAMN the way Lynette 'died' looks painful, like she's in the boiling water. Also I wonder why was that blond woman concerned that it's raining?  IS THAT CHILDE USING HIS DELUSION TO PROTECT US FROM GETTING CHARGED? using delusion to protect not to kill the traveler LETS GO  (Also, I don't know if people have already noticed but the traveler looks like he's in pain while they were cornered by the soldiers.) >>Clutching his head and paimon worrying about him<< I wonder what happened?
this is by far, THE BEST, trailer
What's this??? New map???
Childe Being the Weakest among the 11 fatui He always has the best entrance
ما توقعت كذا يمااا متحمسةة تشايلد موجود و الاعلان و طريقة السباحة و فونتين بكبرها اخخ متى اقدر العب
Ça va être exceptionnel

I'll get back to the game when you put a SKIP button on the dialogues
3:50 goes hard
"Here comes the Primogems"
What a wonderful trailer. I'm so excited to explore Fontaine.
Pls. Kill  childe chlorinde😂
My excitement level is through the roof! I don't know what I loved most about the teaser...the new region, new characters, new weapons, new gameplay...everything?! I only started playing "Genshin Impact" about a year ago and it was definitely one of the best decisions of my life. Teyvat has become like my second home! 💕
*FONTAINE  FINNA BE A MOVIE*
Every new Region of Genshin creates a brand new folder of Surprise in my brain.
childe rerun ?!???  heck yeahh
THE MUSIC, THE IMPLIED PLOT LINE, THE NEW CHARACTERS, THE ARCHON, THE CRISIS IN THE NATION, AND EVEN CHILDEEEE THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZINGGGG

Im honestly speechless. The new nation looks amazing. I love the archon, the character, everything. This a 10000/10. And then childe showing up? Wow
Yo child!!!!!!

Le lore de Fantaine s’annonce banger
Sumeru felt like filler compared to this update man i am speechless tbh it scares me we are 2 more regions left I wonder how this game will top this region
ไอชายยยยยยลูกแม่ๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆๆ

At this point, the traveler might as well become teyvats most wanted
Это просто вау! Мне очень нравится, жду не дождусь сижетки, ради этого готова закрывать сумеру:>
YIPEE CHILDE

Navia with that elegant outfit and fancy hairstyle holding a claymore😂
Am I the only one who does not feel any hype? It's just new quests and maps...
READY FOR FONTAINE
Bienvenue voyageur à mon royaume de lumière
yooooooo
HYDROOO CLAYMOOORE USERRR
childe coming back? all those black suits henchmen? steampunk? underwater? really amazing, I loved it.   also, this trailer confirms my initial belief: I NEED to get nadia
IT’S CHILDE!!!!
CAN YOU PLEASE INSTALL LUMIN, NOT ITERA, AT LEAST ONCE?!
You guys this game is wonderful so excited to see this in game ! ALSO DID YOU GUYS SEE CHLIDE ENTRANCE? ICONIC AS ALWAYS LUVS
I’m so exited for Fontaine! And I really hope one of those 4* swords are Hp%, my Nilou is dying here.
Sumeru was really teasing Fontaine
Wth Im so excited 😍 Btw fontaine is soo pretty and the city tho
Early! I love furina so much..I'm not guaranteed
wait what is childe doing in fontaine
3:01 - 4:39  I LOVE THE DRAMA 🎭. This what I want from Fontaine.
Ofcourse childe Is here  ahhaha
いいね
Childe mains wassup!
damn girl 🫦 Focalors already made me hard
CHILDE LETS GO MY SILLY BABY GIRL POOKIE WOOKIE SCRUNKLY MUNCHKIN SHAWTY BAE
So the archon is the problem again.
Lynette is alive right?
Bueno
The music gave me chills bruhhh. The dancing Meka bosses is definitely gonna be a spectacle battle.
IM FREAKING OUT I did NOT expect my best boy to be in FONTAINE of ALL PLACES AAAAAAAA I’m shaking so FREAKING MUCH
OK fock this, omw to re-download again
THIS IS AMAZING
This trailer made me love Childe even more.
omg i just saw Neuvillette sitting in a front raw just next to the traveler 03:06 in left side
can't decide to pull geo girl or electro girl
Why is she crying and enjoying it at the same time
Yo,this is amazing  now this is the perfect battle I am waiting for while the logic is applied
CHILDE WHAT ARE U DOING HERE
Fontaine looks like spilt over from Arcane.
IF  U KILL MY BOY CHILDE ISTG
Oh my heavens, I was shocked when she did do the archon joke. When u met an archon u solve their nation crisis then they didnt give u any usefull info then tell u go to the next archon then the cycle begins
Childe!!!
Is childe will come to Fontaine for buy souvenir for Teucer?
is the prophecy what we saw in the overture trailer, where freminet was sinking?? does this mean everyone else will be sinking aswell??
LETTSS GOO!! 🔥❤️❤️🔥🔥
😢jesus christ my guy im hyped
praying childe makes it out of fontaine alive🙏
LESGOOOOOOOOOOOO BRROOOOOOOOO
Focalor
So far, I can conclude: - Focalors and people behind the law are idiots until in next patch they will realize they have IQ on negative - there will be organization, which kinda reminds me of EXALT trying to solve all problems to better but law hates them - Lynette will come back after her execution - Focalors vision on start is vision of future where that flawed law still operates - those fake SPARKs will crumble faster than hopes and dreams of aliens when Assault Soldier/Ranger shoots at them in face - probably this will be Inazuma 2.0
CHILDE MAINS HOW ARE WE 😭
I would ABSOLUTELY farm for primos if my ps4 didnt keep shutting itself off bc of the current patch 😭
Childe mains and simps always win
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN
Am I the only one who noticed how the traveler pulls out his sword and falls to his knees?  At this moment, for some reason, red sparks come out of his body.
The fact we are also getting lynette free just makes me even more excited
THIS IS SO COOL!! (ik it's gonna make me cry but I wanna play so bad)
WOOOOOOOOO YEA BABY
YAY  CHILDEEE
CHILDE THE MR. WORLDWIDE THAT YOU ARE
I want to leave a comment about this, but I am still shocked by what I saw...
Please Let Yanfei appears in Fontaine 🙏🙏🙏🙏  Also Furina 😭😭😭😭💯💢
okay guys, it is really good, I love Fontaine, but let's be honest... Why doesn't this have the same quality as 2.0 or 3.0? It's really elegant and... that's it. I enjoy it, but I'm kinda disappointed
3.2 - I get jumpscared by Childe in the forest 3.8/4.0 - I get jumpscared by Childe just spawning out of nowhere in the trailer??? Honestly though it's been a while since he got any major participation in anything so can't wait Also like, rest of this just akfhdnsm But the goddamn Childe jumpscares...
Didn't expect ferminet to sound like that (and that he's a guy)
Poor Lynette! I hope she'll be okay 😢
LOL THEY ADDED WAYS MORE SUBS FOR TEASER AND DID NOT EVEN ADD ENG SUBS FOR STREAM LMAO
Paimon will not pop up during our exploration under the water uwuu
4:34 okay people... please give childe 10 sec
Looks ok. Don't feel too hype like sumeru. Will see how it goes
2:07 - 2:27 SO BEAUTIFUL 😢😮
Very lackluster 4.0 nothing to spend money on meh🤭
HELP I CANT TELL IF FOCALORS IS A LOLI OR NOT
This somewhy gave me library of ruina vibes...
Furinas design amazing omg
Neuvilette looking so handsome!❤
Childe's vision where?😀 4:19
Creo que regresare a jugar 😳🥵
🥶🥶 Childe is so hot ⚡️
Gold I tell you Gold ❤❤
Guys i guess we will be needing more resin’s otherwise it would be a torture 🥲
Wow childe is literally travelling to every nation. This just furthers my theory is childe is going to die in the future. He’s raising his flags. His family is basically secretly hostage, his powers drains his life force, he helps the traveler and may become traitor of the fatui, Hoyoverse is making him appear literally everywhere which means he is a important part of main story.
Mr worldwide is back
Fontaine bouta be the best reigon
THEY FINALLY RELEASED CHILDE FROM THE BASEMENT !!!
Woah
CHILDE OMGJFJDKS MY BOY???? I'M SO HAPPY I CAN'T WAIT OH MY GOD????
hi ! the codes are   - WA845MQHUHKH  - ZT8MLL8GCYKM   - 3BRLL59ZCZKD  ( if you had not watch the livestream yet. )
Army? What army? Just smack down a nilou. No more army. Ggs
Hoyoverse music simply is very detailed and engaging, other games can have good visuals and better gameplay, but the immersion thru music is simply out of reach.  And while Genshin has some story telling issue, the world building is top notch, as soon as you think you have an inking of who the Traveller or Paimon is, a lore bomb can instantly throw all that assumption off.
4:24 YES, CHILDE IS BACK! We once fought this guy in Liyue, now we're gonna fight the Court of Fontaine ALONGSIDE him, this is going to be great!
Ummm…. Hoyoverse thank you for making me goosebumps
I can't wait for the fontaine to be released
CHILUMI NATION WILL RISE!!  (and chiaether too)
just add a button skip dialogue plz
Childe came it at perfect timing
Let's gooooooo 💨💦❄️🌀🌧️
TARTAGLIA?
IDCCCCCCC IDCCCCCC ABT THE RESSSSSSSTTTT BUT MY BOY CHIKLDE IS HEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRREEE 💯
God I love this game
ЧАЙЛД!!! ЧЕГО ТЫ ТАМ ЗАБЫЛ!?
EHAS SZO COOL I LOVE RHIMF
The French Revolution is coming, everyone!
Dayum!!! I was kinda scared that I was bored in the first part of the trailer but the 2nd part was just amazing!! I got goosebumps!
MY JAW DROPPED SEEING CHILDE
Damn my boi Childe literally shows up out of nowhere and steals the show!
Here before it blows up
IM DYINGGD
Everyone: Traveler will be put on trial in Fontaine. Traveler actually gets put on trial in Fontaine... Furina: So where is the twist? Seriously after pretty much the other regions were compromised by the Fatui, you would expect the Traveler to be a bit more cautious this time...
I love the thought and effort put into these trailers! So excited for the action and mystery happening soon ❤️
A wild childe has appeared
I love Focalors so much!! Can't wait for Fontaine
OMG TARTAGAI7SX
Is sir zhongli is returning in 4.0
Childe has the vibe of having a deathflag
3:14 smooth transition
And now, only Natlan and Snezhnaya left
ngl she sounds like mona
THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD!!
WHEN CHILDE APPEARED I SCREAMED IRL. I MISSED HIM SO MUCH 😭 I WAS IN TEARS
Amzaing trailer im so hyped for Fontaine
That's amazing, Fontaine looks like it's going to be really nice to explore and see the beauty of the landscape:) ( Sorry if it's not right I used google translate)
❤❤❤
THE CHILLS SEEING TARTAGLIA APPEAR LIKE THAT
Get childe up and out of here
OMG CHILDE RAAA
Bro i'm so pulling for Clondike Bar or what ever the Gladiator Captain name is
Childe being in Fontaine is INSTANTLY SUS!
y pa cuando natlan??????
I can't wait until version 4.0 sooo exited
MY GOD???????? consider me absolutely positively gagged
Still no cryo catalyst user 😅
Are we finally getting some Childe vs Child action?
I am so hypedddd 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Wait?... Tartaglia?! Reminds me of the luyie archon quest
HOLY- THIS IS SO COOLLL
Am i high or did those two robots kiss 4:11
NEED MORE ADULT CHARACTERS 😭😭😭
❤❤❤ awesome ❤❤❤🎉
OMG Childe is here too...😅
I remember while doing childe story quest he mentioned his family loves in Fontaine right? So him being ennobled should be natural right??
Feels like yesterday sumeru was released. how quickly time flies by :")
Childe thinks he can solo them all💀
Are theater and court intertwined? "rapunzel, rapunzel let down your REGISTRY RECORD"
WHY IS CHILDE BACK
RULES ARE MADE TO BE BROKKKKENNNNNNN!!!!!!
Those underwater areas look absolutely beautiful, the Fontaine characters look super interesting and I can't wait to discover more about this prophecy. But man that Childe entrance was just so badass and epic with his theme playing, I'm so excited to see him in main story again
WOOO FONTAINE FATUI WAR
Not that I dislike childe but... why? We havent finished dottore yet
The Fontaine Primo codes are Code 1: 3BRLL59ZCZKD Code 2: WA845MQHUHKH Code 3: ZT8MLL8GCYKM
Aah i can't wait to dive into Fontaine..
HYPE MAN.
Shishishi
Another day for the traveller to be convicted
Navia will be the Dehya of Fontaine.
CHILDE
Focalors ATE IT. A queen, a queen.
My boi Childe!
My jaw dropped watching this teaser its amazing the story looks so amazing too I can't wait (≧∇≦)/
Surely Childe will not die, right?
I love it when childe just randomly appears
i think we're getting accused of killing lynette. its just a theory though
Childe be acting like an MC right there
EEP
IT'S GONNA BE GOOD. I CAN'T WAIT ANYMORE!!!
IS CHILDE GONNA DIE?
THEY HAVE A HILICHURL CURSE? EXCUSE ME?????
FONTAINE IS SO BEAUTIFUL OMG 😭😭😭
ААААА МОЙ МУЖ БУДЕН В ФОНТЕЙНЕ АОАООАОАООААО
Oh god... Childe is on the good side with us? 🎉🎉🎉🎉
LETSGOOOO FONTAINEEEE!!!!! 🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥
i got too excited about the interactions between the characters and Fontaine's prophecy, but just think about how much we missed Tartaglia in the major storyline..
OMG!!! I usually am not a fan of claymores but HECK AM I PULLING FOR FREMINET!!! HE LOOKS SO CUTE WTF?!! I’ll ofc be pulling for Lyney as well. I NEED to have the siblings, they’re too cute!!!
🎉❤
Part of me is happy we are getting new amazing content and part of me is saying We are getting closer and closer to the End of our Journey as Travellers
I swear. Clorinde is a must pull!
I love this game sm i made extra accounts to see it all again😭😭
I can not wait to explore the underwater mechanics and the new battles that are coming, everything is so perfect but I can’t forget the new even wishes,I need to stop myself from throwing those out like that on every banner😅. Hoyo never disappoints us 👏🏼
So hype for Fontaine!
Chúa hề này ngầu thế
i don't play genshin anymore cuse i dont have enough storage for it but damn this new update looks cool
SHHHHHH
ive prefarmed everything for wanderer- but oh well fontaine caught me 🥰
Are we about to witness the French Revolution?
Amazing trailer!
0:31 - 1:05 😮😮🪄🪄🪄
Childe really had to make an entrance every time in every region.
Aaah it's childe❤❤🔥🔥
as much as i am looking forward to Fontaine, I can't help but worry about my storage ;-;
LYNEY COME HOME
Look... The Childe has appeared 😱
im gonna turn into quaso
why is childe always fighting someone
Тарталья moment
:D
❤❤❤
Alright, time to buy a new phone x.x
lmao the captions at the start
Egeria is prev hydro archon an in there
woahhhhhh
Time to come back.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Story better do a step up in the right direction, seems promising so far! Wonder why childe is there..
okay okay THIS IS SO MUCH WOW
A PYRO 🔥🔥trailer for the Nation of HYDRO!!!!! 🌊🌊
MOIST, VERY MOIST INDEED!
aaaa childeeeeee !!!!
Ммммммм топ
I've been waiting since 1.0, Fontaine is finally here!!!!
As a French person, I approve  a lot like the environment the soundtrack.....EVERYTHING AND THE CHARACTERS IM IN LOVE (Vive la France~ )
Oh my goodness it’s soo beautiful 😮🎉
I am thrilled to know that Childe is coming back to the story ❤️
The way tartaglia came in it looks like he will be a major part  This is what I want characters from previous regions to play an important and major role in the archorn quest
As soon as I saw Childe I was SHOOKETH!
I AM SO EXCITED
0:08 - 0:18 NOOO
Genshin is the best
FONTAINE I'M SO READY FOR YOU
I wasn't expecting to see Childe here. Also, Freminet gives me Albedo vibes and I love it. I'm so hyped for Fontaine!!!!
If childes coming, I better hurry up inazumas last 2 fights, and hurry to finish sumeru ALSO 10O% focalors is the archon quests villian, and aether is trying to stop the way focalors governs the nation of justice
THIS MAY ACTUALLY BE MY FAVORITE UPDATE CHILDE IS HERE GUYS!!!!!!
Can't waaaaaait
IS FONTAINE SINKING⁉️⁉️
I love genshin impact
My idea came true, or at least I think. Lynette seems to be in some kind of danger so maybe Lyney and Freminet teams up with Traveler to save her
Each update, the game just gets better and better. Can't wait to see what Fontaine has got in store for us!
Im sorry but the way they prounounced folcalor 💀 wheres the ç at for it to be said like that 😭 I'm like heavily conflicted about this pronunciation man. Because on one hand it means they know how to "say" most french names, but it also means they don't know their accents (anyways the trailer gave me chills, the hype is real)
Mr international making an appearance yet again
NOOOOOOOOOOOO LYNETTE! WHY YOU? WHYYYYYY! I became anEMO after she turned into water.
YEHEY!!
Bro navia is claymore queen
Childe steals the show again
Хочу фокалорс себе.... Думаю сюжет будет интересным
Nice.
I can hear the childe fans howling rn
You know when a terrorist who tried to destroy Liyue harbour calls you out on your justice system you might really want reconsider your life choices
Another encounter with Childe yahoo!
YOOOOOO CHILDEEE
Can't wait!!
Really cannot waitt. Especially the new music.
So the mission is goinge to be either centered in khaenriah or another mission? Seeing as i dont think "uncovering the secrets of a nation" means fontaine  I think the greeting will be to one of the fatui, not the traveler
CHILDE MY BOY!
Wow
"You've got your rules, I've got mine too" Childe
Marvellous, spectacular, the nature, the scenary, the characters, the culture and the intriguing story……CANT WAIT TOO EXCITED !!!!!! 🤩🤩🤩 And the music, the classic european, the melody amd finese and graceness…..my ears are waiting
Tartaglia está no es tu nación!!
OH MY GOD I’M SO EXCITED
FINALLY MORE CLORINDE CONTENT
best trailer ever i've seen so far actually
So purple gun lady is an electro sword, and French Taylor Swift is a Geo claymore… Outside of another Geo claymore (Hoyoverse why), I’m super excited for the release of this patch and every Fontaine patch after it!
Thật tuyệt vời nhưng điện thoại của không trụ được nữa
Fell on my knees when Lynette says a "Tadaa~"
CHILDE IS BACK!!!!
А где же Арлекино?
genshin on their glowup era
ooga booga
We salute the phone players.
I am soooo excited for Fontaine! The trailer looks great
I had the feeling childe would be involve here, and I was right, gotta be interesting arc
FONTAINEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!
Finally it's  confirmed tartaglia and zhongli.
Fontaine 👍

Can't wait to Fortaine!!!
MR WORLDWIDE BACK AT IT AGAIN
I am way more hyped after seeing Childe being part of the main story again
I'm on my knees for this update
i haven't even finished sumeru... I'M STILL IN INAZUMA...
Childe??
HEYYY TARTAGLIA!! Man knows how to make an entrance!!
i was chilling watching the trailer yk being hype for the new region and crying over freminet and then BOOM TARTAGLIA SHOWS UP AND I'M LIKE "LUV WHAT YOU DOING HERE????"
This was such a great trailer!
2:17 FRECKLES AHH MY BABY FREMINET
Childe really is Mr. Worldwide, huh?
This is what I've been waiting for!!!
i busted
CHILDEEEEEEEEEE
Great trailer Lynettes TADA was cute Taylor Swift is two handed Childe once again for no reason And Hydro Archon being queen
I simultaneously can't wait and don't want Fontaine to come, I still have so many things to do! But omg this looks INCREDIBLY GOOD 😱
This game will continue to shine in the future also❤❤❤
Taylor swift is claymore btw 3:59
I don’t even play Genshin and this gives me shivers 😭
Oh yeah the french revolution coming to fontaine.

Genshin impact nintendo switch xbox
They did a good job with Focalors, she has just the right amount of Brat Energy to piss us off but you can tell there's something else behind the curtain.
REST IN PEACE CHILDE FLY HIGH🕊️🕊️🕊️
BELL.
CHILDE??????????
4:19 childe !!!!!!
I shrieked so loud! I MISSED YOU SO MUCH CHILDE!!

Don’t know if I’m excited… or worried about storage space…
I am sooooooo hype, every new scenery looks amazing, and the story feels like its gonna be great
CHILDE??
I'm hyped as always and is excited to invite Furina in my team.  I was actually gonna risk my pity and try to pull for Lynette, but fortunately she can be invited for free.  I'm very much excited for the music as well as the Archon Quest (lore). 💙
Im honestly so hype for fontaine, the new archon quest, and childe for some reason. Also in the livestream they said about a great flood i want to learn more of it
AAA BABY BOOYY 🐳
Whats Mr Worldwide doing here?
Childe totally gonna die this time guys..
I can not wait it’s soo pretty 😮
GOD IM SO FRICKIN EXCITED FOR FUNTAINE!!!!

Man Childe just had the best entrance all the time. I CAN'T FREEKIN WAIT FOR THIS!
Oh my god CHILDE IS HERE
4:26 خرا
NOT CHILDE
I CANT WAIT TO DIVE IN UNDERWATERRR
If childe dies I'm committing arson
I'm going CRAZY THIS WAS EPIC
CHILDE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE MY HEART ACTUALLY STOPPED WHEN HE CAME ON SCREEN
Istg Sumeru released 2 months ago🥲✋
The music ❤❤❤❤
I can’t believe it’s happening !!! Clearly hyped for Fontaine 🤩
This looks so good. Sumeru's Archon Quest was a big step up from previous ones. I hope this one is just as good.
CHILDE BABY YOU ARE BACK FINALLY I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSS
Genshin turning into danganronpa ☠☠☠☠
Y’all, I’m absolutely TERRIFIED of what is going to happen—
I'M BETTING CHILDE ID OUR ALLY
I love how Childe is beginning to appear in every nation
TARTAGLIA ?? 😭😭
Childe😍
So sumeru 3.0 trailer still unbeatable in terms of music, coreography, and atmosphere.
THIS IS SO COOL OMGGG BUT TF IS CHILDE DOING HERE
Vive fontaine !! 🥳
They have matching voice lines I'M HYPED😭
Noo bbg focalors don't cry
An archon not caring about its people..?  Sounds a bit familiar but I STILL LOVE THE IDEA
So supposedly Lynette will be caught in a performance accident. Fontaine is going to be flooded. Trial battle with Childe's surprise intervention. And Arlecchino is not even here yet. The 1st chapter is already looking good.
4:19 HEY GIRLIE, HOLD STILL
CHILDE NOT YOU TOO
I AM SO HYPED🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 TARTAGLIA IS IN THIS AS WELL??? HYPE!
Once again we get incompetent or mean female god. While the male ones are kind and smart
Childe shall survive and grow stronger from this! Hype is real though (starts saving)
Chileeee
Fontaine's here! Let's gooooo!!
THIS LOOKS SO AMAZING
Genshin's story just keeps getting better and better, I'm so excited for this new version and what's yet to come in the future
BEST BOY IS BACK
I'm so excited for the new version!!I'm sure it's gonna be great
OF COURSE WE GET ARRESTED
the new fontain is soo coooll, the designer did very great
I can't wait lets gooooo !!
fontaines making me concerned for my device 😭
What the Heck Ajax doing there? And our Archon is bratty
some good story is gonna come out and I can't wait, it's good to see another character such as Childe participate in the story. We will have some real action incoming
Natlan when
Amazing trailer as always, I am so excited! ❤  See you all in Fontaine 😁
CHILDE IS BACK?!
Childe vs Chlorine would be a battle I wanna see
Something tells me Yanfei might be playing a very important role in the future considering an unknown trial is happening. And when a trial like this happens, it’s going to end up involving the traveler either way anyways
4:19 BEST BOYYYYYY
LETS GOOOOOOOO
The music on freminet’s part is GODLY
Go childe..teach them a lesson 💪💪
NIce! I cant wait when the update go lives!
Child everywhere
CHILDE OMGGGGG
I JUST REALIZED FREMINET HAS FRECKLES ITS LOOKING SO GOOD.
Lynette saying tada is so cute
we finna get arrested 😭
why does freminet kinda remind me of astronaut in the ocean
I excited for the story! And Childe clearly has his own sense of justice.
Man that perfection
fire boy and water girl?
Can't wait for it but I don't have wifi 😭 it would take 1 full day to update
My boy childe is finally back it feels like its been forever im overjoyed
So excited for the archon quest and for the underwater exploration 😍😍
0:20 Sassy child archon WOOOOO!! Can't wait for her (Focalor), Neuvillete, and Clorinde!
IM SO EXCITED FOR FONTAINE
Y’all have to chill it’s been 3 minutes😭
I HOPE MY STORAGE CAN TAKE IT
Lde what are u doing here??!!!
3 years of journey....ahhhhh
OH MY GODH ALREADY
the courtyard at 1:50 belongs to a hexenzirkel member, calling it now
I came
Fontaine just might be my favorite city now qnd I haven't even been to it yet XD
2:15 finally we CAN use The Bell 😂
IT'S HERE Y'ALL IT'S HERE
Don't care about lore only care about pulls 🤑🤑🤑🤑
GOOD LUCK LYNEY WANTERS. OUR TIME IS NOWW!!!! 💕🔥🐱
Freminet so prettyyy
Focaloooooooor.... EREGSI beraaat ❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂
NAVIA AND HER PEOPLE?! THAT FEELS SO MUCH LIKE A MAFIA MOVIE SCENE OR A SPY SCENE
Im hiatus see ya guys  edit : nvm, i see tartaglia and i will keep playing this game
im so dissapointed that focalors has actually long hair... without the rat tails it would have been so badass
New monster does look cool but pls don't be annoying as the scorpion and deer
Ok but why does freminets them go so hard
LYNEY COME HOME PLS
Wow, it's almost been a year since sumeru's release. Time sure flies huh? Really excited for all that awaits us in fontaine~!
Genshin's trailers have been progressively becoming more cinematic with each update, showcasing breathtaking visuals, beautiful animation, and awe-inspiring artwork. I can hardly contain my excitement to explore Fontaine and embark on the archon quests and dive into the underwater regions.   Seeing Childe again is such a delight, it's been a while since he last appeared in any archon quests after Liyue, It's high time he lends a hand to his fellow comrade.
How is childe everywhere
Our first hydro claymore
Who is excited for Fontaine 👇
finally, its here! very excited to see whats to come. gl to anyone pulling!
Beautiful
Are people actually turning into those dolls? These I can see from where it is coming But, excited for Fontaine lets go boiis😋
CHILDE IS BACK!!!!!

Why am I getting Evangelion vibes?
Neuvillette and Focalors sitting back while everyone else work:
The story is getting darker in every nation, damn
FAV NATION FR
Форалокс такая классная тут❤ А появление Чайлда вообще внезапно.
Halo
Наконец-то
Fontaine absolutely lives up to the hype! I love the jazz, the 19th century industrial aesthetics, and the underwater environment! Also my favorite harbinger’s return!!!
AAAA IM SO HAPPY
Have they finally added a skip button?
Beautiful 😍❤️❤️❤️ Omfl childddd
The bell is finally useful
Omg its childeeee
Cant wait for Paimon to ruin every Story 😊
If they haven't shown arlecchino in this trailer then she will definitely have a crazy entrance in the story somehow
Хисока😂?❤
Navia my queen
egg
WE WILL BE HERE NO MATTER WHAT. 💯💯💯❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Even if Fontaine's Archon quest ends up lacking or even a total flop like with Inazuma's, I'm just excited to see Lyney and Lynette in-game
Rip storage

TARTAGLIAAAA💗💗💗💗💗
WE NEED ENGLISH SUB IN LIVE STREAM
I love Better Call Saul I wish court was real
Im sorry if im the only one saying this, but I dont like the hydro archons personality Her personality just seems snobby and not for me. But the other characters and their personality/abilities Seem super fantastic!
12 days until Fontaine!!
Sad no showcase for hydro traveler 😢
IT WAS NEVER HOYOVER, WE'RE ALWAYS HOYOBACK
I have only two words: ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE!!!   The music, the cinematography, the designs, the voices, CHILDE(??), I seriously can't wait to finally play it, if I can. (rip mobile users)
For real, the 2 dudes are speaking in Chinese the whole time, with English captions!!!! How we going to understand Chinese!!! I would suggest you make two shows, one in English and one Chinese
Carajo que espectaculo!!
So excited for the new Archon Quest!
🥖🥖🥖🥖🥖
i have been waiting for fontain so long
5 Nations already…  how the time flies…

I LOVE FOCALORS DESIGN
Bro Fontaine peeps are so Drippy wtf 🤑😍😍
Neuvilette and Tylor swift😍😍😍
🧑‍⚖ _"Before you Judge me, make sure you're Perfect. ..."_  🧑‍⚖  This is the vibe I'm getting out of the upcoming 4.0. Looks intriguing.
Oh my god I am SO HYPED. thank you genshin!
Of the countries that have appeared, Fontaine has become the most special one where we will be able to freely explore the ocean much longer than before, which is the biggest breakthrough ever
Omg freminet looks so cute😭
This looks better than anything we've seen in genshin so far. I'm really excited for Fontaine!
IM SO EXCITED IT FEELS LIKE SUMERU WAS JUST YESTERDAY 😭
That fall gives me Niagara vibes in America
Childe confirmed to be Mr worldwide?
I thought it was pronounced Foh-kuh-lore instead of Foh-suh-lore 😭 I’ve been saying it wrong the entire time
Fontaine has been the nation I’ve been anticipating since I started playing. Can’t believe it’s finally here!!!
When I tell you I freaked out when I saw Childe YOU HAVE NO IDEA
I GOT GOOSEBUMPS I CAN'T WAIT
I SWEAR EACH REGION GETS BETTER THAN THE LAST!!!
TARTA WIN
I'M SO EXCITED TO SEE CHILDE AGAIN😭
Ну всё теперь будем ждать селестию:^
Man the two robot couple dancing make me feel so single. 😭
So many trouble in genshin because the holy principle
