It reminded me of the Malfunction Junction I-59/20 in Birmingham, Alabama in January 2002.
I can't believe they got away with it. This incident was planned. I'm a Uber driver. I drove one of the people affiliated with the construction company. The truth is, they were behind in some work and they had run out of money. This incident was planned to give them more work so that they can add on the money that they needed for the previous job. I guess you can say the driver of the tanker took one for the team. And now they have their money and more work. That is why they were able to do an alternate route so quickly. They had it already planned out.
Wait a Second,,, if Jet Fuel can cause 3 Skyscrapers to turn to Dust,,, then why is that bridge still in one piece??
Such a sad thing to happenn.
tankers always catch fire in oddly specific spots. had one catch fire on the Brent Spence Bridge in Cincinnati not too long ago. luckily nothing happened but if it did go down because of it, it would affect millions of people, just like in this instance
All very strange all this accidents on Biden administration. I HAVE A QUESTION : IS THE TRUCK DRIVER DEAD, OR HE IS ONE MORE PAID BY CHINA LIKE BIDEN AND HIS DEMS GANG?
Well if this truck melted the steel holding the bridge I guess jet fuel can melt steel beams
There is no footage of an actual tanker at the scene!
Since when does a truck fire cause a bridge to collapse unless it was blown up?
Wait times and ⛽ price spikes will be a pain
Bro its a canon event
If that were japan or china it would already be fixed. I hope the trans movement was under there
May the person who died Rest in Peace!  I hope authorities are able to notify their love ones.  It is scary to see the vehicles driving on both sides of the bridge in the midst of the flames and seeing the ground buckle.  Hopefully, out if this tragedy new safety protocols are developed and implemented.
So what did that $1 trillion infrastructure bill do?😅😅LET'S GO BRANDON!
All of these incidents look "Like a Set-up" to me. Pay attention.
What goes up must come down
American infrastructure is the best
Wow. That's crazy. My mom takes this bridge to work.
Money money money hahahah These goofs running our countries are destroying shit on purpose.

I dont understand why theyre projecting this will be closed for MONTHS.  For such a critically important corridor, and for damage clearly confined to just a couple of segments, it seems like it should only take (at most) a few weeks.  If anyone has linkable info on that, pls post.
Mayor Jim Kenney is now asking for federal funds to repair the bridge. Don't any of these cities insure any of their roads and buildings?
What happened to build back better? Where is all that money? Nothing has been built and nothing is better.
Biden's build back better plan in action! 😂
The 9-11 conspiracy types are about to show up and tells how impossible it is for a fuel fire to do this kind of damage to steel and concrete.
Is there a picture of the tanker or remnants, yet to see
Wonder who inspected that bridge and how long ago. Someones ass is going to be in a world of hurt.
I go over that bridge every day thats just crazy
Philadelphia’s department of transportation need to cut through all the red tape and start rebuilding that section asap. When a section of the Santa Monica freeway (I-10) collapsed in West L.A, during the Northridge Earthquake in January 1994.  That section of freeway was rebuilt and completed in 3 months. Cal Trans and other construction companies 24/7 to get that span completed and opened up.
Can someone fill me in on why the truck couldn't at least drive from underneath the bridge before it stopped? Did the operator  perform regular maintenance  and  inspections on his truck and trailer? Did he have a fire extinguisher to put it out before it got out of control? Where is DOT? Who is the operator and is he independent or under a company? We need to see the records on this rig! We need some f'n accountability here!
Imagine if the taxes you pay,actually went to the project or department for use if what the taxes you pay for are used for..  Instead of using it to line the pockets of HIRED PUBLIC CIVIL SERVANTS..  YOU ALL KNOW WHO,WHAT,WHEN WHERE AND HOW..  LETS STOP THE CORRUPTION..  LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AGAIN 🇺🇸
Is fetterman still on vacation?
China bashers please take note, your construction is equally susceptible to mishaps as much as anyone else's.  Sorry, I don't mean to be insensitive, just calling a spade a spade. ✌✌✌
A petrol truck just happened to be on fire under the I 95 overpass!!! How stupid do they think we are
Here is a brilliant idea...  Fill in the underpass with dirt....So its not a bridge...  just solid earth..    People could be driving across it in a few days.    Then engineer a repair later.
Could not have happened to a better city or state. Let’s just give our billions and billions to overseas countries and needless causes in this country. Let’s not fix one bridge or road ever want that be fun? This country deserves every road and bridge collapse it gets because of collective ignorance of our communist government, nationally and state wide. You people get what you vote for.
Why was the tanker parked in that area?  Where’s the driver?  What was the tanker carrying?  Why no investigation?  Very suspicious!
How is that build back better going?
Planned
Philadelphia! The city of brotherly love? WHAT A JOKE!! UH HUH!!
American infrastructure is fine. We’ll blame this one on George Soros
Trump said that the infrastructure has to be improved.
“The Gang destroys a Road”  It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia
Prayers for I95🙏🏼
tofu bridge!
Infrastructure plan at it's finest
Martial law test 1
Let this sink in, 9/11 truther idiots (Perjury Traitor Greene). Watch the documentary on how the WTC was designed, engineered, and constructed. The WTC construction documentary was made many, many years BEFORE 2001. Fuel-heat WILL make steel re-enforced concrete fail. Every floor of the WTC was basically a 14 acre concrete slab with the majority of it's weight supported by L-brackets welded to the outer perimeter vertical steel beams that gave it that unique look that it had. That was necessary to allow room for all of the elevator shafts needed to build a building that tall. And this bridge's support beams were WAY stronger than those outer WTC walls.
Obviously this was on purpose!
What time approximately did this happen 😳😳
Fire smells like smoke,,what does Terrorism smell like. ?
We just traveled back to 50 years the amount traffic gonna be in northeast Philly I can’t imagine
If this happens in China, it will only takes less than a month to have it up again. US road constrution speed sucks.
Its going to take them years to repair this🙄
“IT DO GO DOWN”
Couldn't have happened at a worse time.  Those trips to the shore are going to be torturous.
Just like the President of the United States.
Was it a terrorist attack or what??
for the trillionth time.. how many times did I say a major highway such as the I-95 is very important
No need to worry, folks, pot-hole pete is on his way.
Truck fires all over the country Whats going on?
What happened to the truck driver?
Damn. Nice music there, USA Today.
Thanks for that infrastructure bill Joe Biden! It’s really doing us wonders 🤩
Want to open I-95 quick? Remove collapsed area to side. Get truck and bodies out. Truck in gravel/dirt to fill the area (street below) with gravel/dirt use debris left over from collapse too. Then blacktop over compacted dirt. Shore up the side that has been compromised. Open road to traffic. Take about 8 to10 days working 24 hours every day. You also set in motion getting new girders and everything else needed to site, once ready on side streets or other staging area replace the overpass starting on a weekend.  You wind up losing the street under I 95 for 6 weeks or so. So what?? better to detour that street then I 95 for months while you get I beams and everything else needed to philadelphia from wherever.😆😆😆😆
That was a brand new brideg, with the California requirements. I miss the old steel beam bridges. It would have been ready for morning rush hour. Now, it took them over 8 months to build that the first time. our infrastructure is very weak, and easy to destroy.
Maybe instead of blaming the drivers, someone should review if it was shoddily made in some scheme to keep the taxpayer money.
American archaic infrastructure. China are the world's leaders in infrastructure and fast speed rail so maybe blame them for the US being backward. Maybe blame the Japanese for having bullet trains way back in 1964 when The Beatles released their first record album. Last year there were radioactive water leaks in Minnesota and now Philadelphia and Louisiana. Where is Biden's infrastructure funding? Surely DeSantis hasn't used up all the infrastructure funds to send migrants from another state to another state like he did with Florida's Covid funding.
This is suspicious. Are they sure this truck was not loaded with explosives? Where is the driver? What is the name of the company that owns the truck? Where is the manifest for its contents?
Wow, infrastructure is in really good shape over there 😂
GOOD OL' BUILD BACK BETTER FRAUD STRIKES AGAIN IN 2023
Where is Mayor Pete?
Biden where's our infrastructure the railroads and now our bridges come on bro you said you were going to help us out
Who knew bridges were important components of infrastructer
Didn’t this just happen in Connecticut?!? This typ thing is happening way too often to be real accidents… trains derailed with toxic chemicals on them… this is suspicious
They are trying to stop Trump from running in 2024. The politicians are at war with each other and we the people are stuck in the middle.
Philadelphia, PA? The same place where we had ELECTION FRAUD in 2020. Just collapsed. Yeah sure.
This bridge just collapsed? NO WAY.
This country is under attack, but the politicians won’t tell us the truth.
Time to bring in the Chinese construction company, demand 24 hour repair. Guess what, they will make it happen. They have done it before.
MADE IN CHINA!  LOL!
There ain't no way in hell that a bridge built out of well constructed materials  with cement and steel through the pillars a fire from underneath no way is going to collapse I know this because I've worked in construction I've worked in concrete this stuff is tested underneath the worstest conditions that are possible before it is put on the roadway especially a bridge to be safe for pedestrian s I can almost guarantee that this bridge was going to faill because it was deteriorating from corrupt politicians filling their pockets with the money that was supposed to be used for this bridge to be redone and it never happened it happens all the time I live in Michigan with her sink holes the size of sewer caps inside the middle of the road and I wonder where all the taxpayers on every business house and any other form of revenue they can get from taxes I wonder what they do with our hard-earned tax money it sure is not going into the roads in the places it needs to be so for everybody on here saying that something happened like this somewhere else and so forth know this did not just happen out of the ordinaryeither it was staged planned or from lack of taking care of the things and they need to take care of like roadways Bridges exedra betray meant to the people's money meaning the people's hard-earned tax money that never was put to work in the places it was supposed to be not saying natural disasters can't happen but this was not earthquake here no way in hell that fire from up underneath the bridge is going to make the bridge collapse think about that they got beams and re-rod in beams the size or bigger than railroad ties inside the middle of the roadway in in some of it is aircraft constructed or construction to where you could run an airplane through son-of-a-bitch and it wouldn't collapse rest in peace anybody that got hurt or died but the city needs to be sued in every buddy that had lost their lives or seriously hurt I hope they get billions of dollars
Jesus
Violent overnight shootings in Philly 5 dead , several injured.
Pipe bomb , or C4 or Dynamite . You guys have alot to look at these bridges and highways , omg I cant understand why inspections are not done on a daily basis , all the way into New York , come on . Im so tired . Florida , California , all the way to Canada .
yes build back better at it's finest thank you Joe Biden
Prayers to those In  philadelphia i-95 collapse june 11 be safe
Hold Peter Paul Buttigieg accountable if the repair cannot be completed in one month.
Wouldn't be surprised if there's a lot more to this incident?
Waiting for liberals to start blaming mr.Putin and mr.Trump...
So i hear something similar happened in VA and CT ? Looking for links. First thing i thought when i saw this story was sound fishy ...
RIP to the truck driver who didnt make it out in time. 💔💔
I have a question to US federal government - Where did all tax payer money go?  To wars! 😡  Also the state and local government collecting so much tax from residence, why are we still driving on poor road conditions and crumbling infrastructure when Americans keep paying tax and they are only getting higher, yet our living conditions are getting worse?
Let's spend some more money on Ukraine while half of our own infrastructure go in flame
31trillion printed and gone - and what are we paying for, collapsing roadways, trains detailing, the most expensive and worst healthcare, kids being educated by drag Queens an on an on - can't imagine how things will be when we start spending real money. . .
Too bad We Can't  Spend  Our Tax Dollars  on Infrastructures or Education  instead on Everyone Else
BOYCOTT ALL WOKE COMPANIES AND ESTABLISHMENTS NOW...PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN FROM THIS WOKE INSANITY...
So this is what built back better looks like.
Well. More cuts to SNAP and Medicare to pay the contractors who don't pay taxes to fund infrastructure.
👉 EQUITY 👈 Let people who identify as WOMEN do the work. It's not fair only MEN get the high-paying construction jobs! 🤣
Its a real shame, especially since they just rebuilt this portion of 95 in the city. Its a huge loss for facilitating goods in the area
So did the truck just disappear....
WHO WAS THE DRIVER/idiot.....???
So WHERE ON I95 in Philly is it ?
Im in philly.  I take 95 every morning and evening.  They are constantly working on these sections of 95. Its been yrs and yrs. Wth are they actually "fixing" all these yrs when this collapse could just easily happen?
Will the Secretary of Transportation visit this one? Or is he meeting with Beavis?
well thats going to cause a traffic nightmare!  i95 is the east coast main interstate highway artery , traffic will have to be diverted to 295
wow!! gonna take a longtime to fix that..
Waiting for all the "gas can't burn hot enough to melt steel" folks to show up.
Traffic was already a nightmare in Philly which is 50 years behind for modern times and numbers; it’s really going to be a nightmare for trucks
1 idiot caused all this
Punishment 😂😂
We have the money and power to fix this in a few months, maybe weeks,  But will republicans just block any attempt? while democrats prattle on about needing more police...  How about firemen?!   what a clown show.
Infrastructure week really changed things
With traffic already a nightmare here, I’m dreading doing jobs in the city now.
The attack from within continues
Well that’ll screw traffic up some more.
That route was already horrible traffic wise but it is going to be horrific for commuters going that and for trucks people leave early if you have to travel that way
What I love about this story is that we Americans need to stop whining about repairing/maintaining infrastructure. Just think of all the money we saved by letting this bridge fall into disrepair. Now, there are more jobs created to fix this bridge. I thank the GOP and conservatives for holding the line on unnecessary spending on infrastructure. And, if anyone was killed in this mess, it's god's will. Amen.
Let’s send 2 more billion to Ukraine
So much for that infrastructure bill $$$$🤣🤣🤣🤣
Our bridges collapse and roads are destroyed. That I-95 section is a new construction and they are working on it from Obama time and it’s sad to see it collapsed due to fire. We need our nation to start building new bridges, high ways and modern railway networks. Nation looks old when compared to other Asian countries infrastructure and these politicians are destroying our cities and nation by spending and supporting useless wars instead of spending money in national building..
US is turning into a third world country.
How long, ya think, before they just come out and tell us that China/Russian cells are attacking our infrastructure?
Where are the interstate highway surveillance videos that show the moment of the fire and the truck? All interstates have video cameras.
Good grief😲 Prayers up 🙏🌹🙏
Ohh no!
America showing her age
Nothing to see here,  Moving On.
I’ve never see a truck fire cause a concrete overpass to collapse.
What was in the truck, which made that bridge collapse, looks like fishy and contractors will make more money now.
I'm from Atlanta. We also had a fire that collapsed one of our interstates not long after our bird team blew a double digit halftime lead in the Super Bowl.
Don't tell the 9-11 conspiracy kooks that Fuel melted steel.  They hate that 😂
But of course jet fuel couldn't possibly cause the WTC to collapse on 9/11
😳😳😳
Cowards just put a ramp and have cars jump over see u soon boy
Would you look at that
This is just the beginning. We are slowly watching the systematic destruction of our country.
That was setup complimentary of your us government just like 9/11
Kinda like I75 in Atlanta a few year's back
BAN HIGH SPEED AUTOMATIC ASSAULT TRUCKS NOW!!!
Republicans not thinking American infrastructure matters. Smh.
Strongest American infrastructure.
Its amazing how many people underestimate fire.
Truck fire collapsing a bridge, yes. Jet fuel bringing down the towers and building 7. Absolutely not. Cover that
Good thing we are sending all that money to Ukraine and other bullshit instead of working on fixing upgrading our infrastructure creating jobs. I swear a 9 year old roblox player could run this country better.
Will this affect the ability to get to the airport coming down the turnpike, to the blue route, to 95 then airport exit? And then the reverse going back? Not sure exactly where this is.
Fascinating
Thank god tun tavern isn’t around to see what Philadelphia has become
Meanwhile Vin diesel saying "I got this" as he grinds the car to the other side.
Buildings falling, bridges collapsing, electrical grids failing and our politicians are arguing about woke while America falls apart.
Our infrastructure is a joke here, meanwhile we send billions to the most corrupt country in europe
Again?! A similar collapse happened on I-95 in Philadelphia due to a tire fire in the mid-1990’s. Perhaps more structural inspections would be useful to stop these collapses in the future?
Where's that build back better action Joe?
Luckily, we’ve sent all of our EXTRA money to the communist country of Ukraine.  I wonder if they’ll fix our bridges? 😶🇺🇸
Bridges collapsed across America, Minneapolis, Florida, and now Indiana.  Yet we waste money BILLIONS on Ukraine
Funny how it broke at the seams. Seems more than fire related, there wasnt any fire on the other side. Should have been strong enough.
Please treat your journalists better.
Wow. This sounds almost identical to what happened here in Atlanta six years ago.
Bidens infrastructure bill really doing a good job
Oh God this ain't good.  Like him or not he pushed hard for the infrastructure bill, and by God we need it.  Biden& his party did that for us, by standing firm on this end of the budget. °~•.☆.•~°
Unbelievable billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine meanwhile our nation is falling apart.
Philly is such a shit show
Too many poorly maintained trucks with drunk derelict drivers coming up from Mexico and endangering our highways.
Couldn’t get any footage of the truck burning? What a great news channel.
Seems like that infrastructure bill that biden got passed is needed huh? The very thing that almost all republicans opposed
Hope that this doesn’t happen in NYC bridges there are old as heck
Made in the USA  /S
Phuck Philly; Go Astros, you counts (silent o)
What a beautiful city.
The oldest city bridge and some buildings need to be checked. The materials that they are used to build had age limit and it will collapse when these materials begin to ruin.
The world is ending
Everything collapsing, yet they have billions for Ukraine.
So… that infrastructure bill and the TRILLIONS that have been given way to foreign countries.. Kind of wish your government had the money for its own citizens now don’t you.  Could have rebuilt a lot of roads and put thousands to work…
Where are the shots of it happening
This is horrible i remember when 85 collapsed in ATL due to homeless starting a fire under it.
Just a thought… do we know who is driving these trucks , seems to me these ACCIDENTS seem to occur in major connections on freeways , is someone trying to find out what would cause the most disruption . Is there something sinister here ???
So much for tax $ for upkeep here being abused, not used.
Every 4 years we hear about infrastructure but nothing happens  ? Shovel ready ? All b.s.
Probably should have put that infrastructure money Biden, gave you to good use, should have done it quickly, instead of pocketing it.
American infastructure everyone
Great infrastructure
Welcome to 2nd World Status
The infrastructure in America is old..bridges that need repair are ignored. All the money is going for foreign wars we don't have any right to be in and illegal "immigrants" which get everything absolutely free and we're paying the freight for all of it. Streets are crumbling, bridges fall down but the money is never spent on any of it.
This bad!
😱😱😱😱
Spike in Train Derailments. Spike in problems at Food Processing Facilities (60x jump from before June 2021 to After). 40+ wildfires begun simultaneously across Canada, leading environmentalist 'tech optimist' journalists to rejoice on Twitter. Now things like this. It had to be a bridge. (Not to mention problems in every other sector of society and production.) No suspicions? No investigation? No accountability? No conjecture? Huh.  May I suggest that we have a larger problem: most of the world believes that Darwinian origins are fact - and that leads to a deficit of understanding fellow humans and mutual support for human freedom. So in our present collapse-s we are witnessing how Darwinian belief Drags everything doggedly down.
Well, i get on 95 northbound just north of that mess...i wont be afraid to enter the road because of the sickos coming out of philly doing 85 mph😅
Cant reopen it until the hole is fixed, i suppose.
I can't believe biden would do this
Must be one of those racist bridges
Hurry send our money to Ukriane!!!  F n not zi  collaborators
a truck fire huh not it was a piece of shit road
Hot 🔥....melted the rebar and it's gave way. ..
INB4 burn bridges
America could have used that money sent to Ukraine for infrastructure.
This was a waste of my time
Atlanta had the same facelift.
America (Especially liberal cities) are a dump
What a well built bridge.
Philadelphia ghetto people ghetto city stay on the east coast please
We can send billions to other countries, yet our own infrastructure is falling apart. Over taxation, miss representation, religious prosecution the starting of trying to take our weapons. Yes this is the new world. ✝️🪂🐎🦅🪶✝️ Ret.82abn
Build back better! Infrastructure deal!
Ffcfffffdds  No
Biden’s America
Instead of repairing and replacing roads tax money is paying for wars gender studies and many other unnecessary things
Where’s buttigieg to check the bridges for safety?  But a truck fire caused this?  Yeah, I don’t think so!
Thank god I don’t go that way in Philly anymore
Gubment failures as usual.
Instead of spending 100s of billions a month on illegal immigration we should be investing in our infrastructure water roads our veterans
I wonder if billions of aid to Ukraine could have went to our infrastructure, excuse me I mean the bidens
No way on earth a fire caused the collapse. Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Louisville are next on the list
And just when you thiught Philly couldnt get any worse...
What was the truck hauling that burned so hot?
$20 says Biden and flaming Buttigieg blame Trump on this...
Fitting. It matches the zombie apocalypse in Kensington
This is the tire fire under I95 version 2.0
And I thought that the bridge collapse occurred in Miami, but I was wrong. This was in Philadelphia.
I've been under those bridges and they were collapsing back in 09 and God knows they weren't fixed since then all the money went to the former mayors audi r8 and his pockets
I used to live in Andalusia, just south of Woodhaven. Expect the 66 trackless trolley on Frankford Avenue, as well as Roosevelt Boulevard, to be jammed during rush hour for quite some time.
China would have a prefab section fitted within the week. American construction is a joke. Everything is bureaucratic and takes a mighty miracle to get done. And then to get done on time and on budget is somehow another miracle
This happened in atlanta a few yrs ago
All that money for Ukraine $170 Billion! Of Americans taxpayers dollars but yet the government barely spends on infrastructure or how about homelessness that would only cost $20 billion but they won’t do it
sus
I reember when the same thing happened to an overpass here in Atlanta.....traffic was beyond a nightmare for weeks.............
It wasn't blown up by the truck. Those changes were set in place by you know who.
they let the steel I beams get to hot and they gave way ! you have to think outside the box lots of water inside on the fire or a tuck full of liquid carbolic aka co2 may have snuff it out
I landed in Philadelphia and when i looked down from the airplane, i saw the same decrepyted infrastructure i see all over the east
Second time this has happened to I 95, last time was up CT way.  Suggest FEDs either review traffic controls, stop signs, lights, street lights etc under all interstates or make states do them by making them pay for repairs.  My guess is there needs to be traffic lights and cameras to record and fine offenders with nice big signs saying so, so people SLOW THE F DOWN AT INTERSECTIONS.  Potentially underpasses at interstates can be coupled with on and off ramps from the interstate and adjacent city streets making a 10 way intersection which is NOT GOING TO FUNCTION ON STOP SIGNS
"Officials closed the interstate while firefighters extinguished the flames."  Well... once they get those flames extinguished, I'm glad they will be able to open the interstate despite a huge chunk of it missing.
Your tax dollars at work 😂
better send more money to ukraine
Tax money hard at work
But we have 10s of billions for Ukraine and other countries. Think about that when you vote in 2024!
Such a beautiful road ,shame it got damaged
The reason why things like this happen is because we're spending so much money on cops. We don't have the money for infrastructure. That's the America we chose. There'll be a lot more of this happening in the years to come
I thought obama fixed all our crumbling roads and decaying bridges?
Hurry! SEND MORE MONEY TO UKRAINE!!!
In Japan for instance this would be fixed in a max of 3 days but in the USA it will take a year
The tax money that should have been put into infrastructure was really a lie - it has been stolen !!
I-95 omg 🤦🏾‍♂️ travel gone be a extra 3 hrs if you drive a lot.
Philly sure is lookin great these days!
This isn't a maintenence failure. Pretty much the same  situation as 9/11, the fuel on fire causes such high pressures and heat that it softens steel enough to bend and loosen.
Yikes!
ENJOY
Couldn’t have happened to a Better City as FILTHADELPHIA !!! 👍👍👍
Fire didn't cause this issue since that bridge was already damages prior to the collapse due to the road salts
For those of us out in the country, the cities have become quite the source of amusement. SMH.
Where’s the actual truck ?? They don’t show that something seems odd
Joe will fix it
Did 👍✅ it out.
ahora se demoran 4 meses para repararla y cobrar millones , si es la india china que e visto muchísimos video han hecho proyectos tres vese mas grande que eso y  lo asen en una noche o 24 horas y con calidad, y son en pasos de ferrocarriles que es mas difícil de hacer.
More then likely hypnosis was used to have the trucker drive his truck an hit the underpart of the bridge 🌉 to make it fall an kill himself."P/N/M."" Ps the war is at home here in the USA you need to take care of that before you can joined the big guys in Ukraine military 🎖️ troops an war against Putin s Russia."
So much for infrastructure spending
Pretensioned concrete fails under high heat. Every bridge that uses this engineering should be replaced.
After 1966, we just kept putting patches & bandaids on our highway infrastructure.  Even the newer ones received the same treatment.  It takes an act of God to get a simple pothole fixed.
I was on there yesterday t😮
American infrastructure is collapsing
They are destroying our country and infrastructure
Gonna see a lot of this I the next 10-20 years infrastructure is a serious problem today and has been for decades
😳 That would certainly be a bummer for those driving to their vacation destinations!
Electric vehicles are much heavier than most vehicles leading to many collapses. But government wants a excuse to control us all so global warming aliens white supremacy ect...
At least they'll actually fix the bridge now since it's obviously been left to rot for decades
How aweful
happened here in michigan about 10-15 years ago.
So with all the tax money they take from us we still have the roads of a 3rd world country!?!  What are they doing with the trillions they keep taking!?!
Looks like lack of maintenance to me,can’t give all the money to every looser in the United States, without implications.
I don’t believe for a minute it had anything to do with the truck fire. The bridge would’ve held up if it was structurally sound.
WoW
Imagine if the trillions Pelosi, Biden, and Schumer printed in the name of “infrastructure” actually ended up there, and not San Francisco-Based “Democrat ATM Banks” that we’re pillaged, collapsed, and bailed out by Biden, sticking US taxpayers again with the bill?
What in the world was burning in that truck and/or are the bridges that flimsy?
