2:25
you can complain that football is ruined but var but football is destroyed by divers like jack grealish and he did it at the start of the game which caused it to spread throughout the whole team which is why they got the pen diving needs to be taken care of
Can see why Aston Villa are upset with that decision, Ogbonna was a faulted man was behind him not defending right so if he defended properly he be in front of Watkins and then Watkins onside!
respect to millwall and west ham fans for refusing to bow to communist marxists no surrender rule britannia 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Look at Grealish when he missed the pen. Snide little look at the manager, 'told you'
I think VAR has it's place, it shouldn't be used for intentional handballs that should be obvious to spot. If there isn't an obvious distinction in offside then it should be quickly reviewed and moved on. It should remain for violent conduct.
Fabianski was great
On a cold night VAR would give you offside for your breath I reckon 😂
Villa playing like the classic ol' Villa recently.      Sh*te. Surprised if they don't finish bottom 4 again.
Get rid of VAR It's killing the passion and joys of being able too celebrate a goal in the old natural way , mistake are acceptable in every walk of life and some of the goals getting chalked off for pointing to were you want the ball played as in the Leeds game and penalties for players deliberately flicking the ball off players arms & diving with minimum contact is killing the thrill of the game we all loved, personally I'd love to see players getting tackled hard after all It's a blood and guts sport, not ballet dancing ✌️
So Watkins arm was offside yet he cannot score with his arm and it still counts as offside. VAR is a joke
Boycott the game altogether, these overpaid over indulgent will see their salary reduced to a worker average earning - - we can enjoy provincial local teams just as much -
VAR destroyed the beautiful moments. You can’t even celebrate in peace
What a strike from grealish
Var ruining my fantasy team wow
Villa have been hard done by fact feel for your villa fans even if was deemed off side what about the penalty foul which was clearly a fioul even before the off side lines were marked. I'm a leeds fan but its disgusting how villa have  been denied any points
I see Watkins is still terrible at taking penalties
Nobody is gonna say VAR gave Villa a soft penalty ?
so...his hair was offside?........seriously?......what a joke.
Grealish banger
Yes Yes I use my arm in football.
Make offside by player's FEET. Not a forearm or fingernail.
We need to start the charity to shoot VAR refs. Donations will go towards payed killings of the VAR refs every time they call an offside because someone is an atom offside
Miles offside
The VAR ref for this game should be shot
Behrahma v Watkins
No footage of Grealish diving? Shame, it was more entertaining than most of the game.
3 things that are certain in life: aye
we were robbed big time
Martin Tyler puts me to sleep. He needs to retire.
Cheers var and Watkins, had a fiver on ogbonna first goal and West ham 2-1 hahah irrons
West Ham are the dark horses this season wow they're up to 5th
Funny how VAR can see its offside but not that the defender had his arms all over him, fouling him, slowing him down.
It wasn't an onslaught and the ref was absolute rubbish!!! Grealish is a dirty diving cheat...miles off on the facts Sky...
Bruh var is kinda getting out of hand
VAR is atrocious. It's starting to really affect the game in a negative way. It's only really needed for small margins of decision making this is ridiculous
Wtf  a great goal  not given  criminal that
The ref was so generous, he ignored two or three fouls that should be cautioned..
VAR ruins football
Do you use your hand in football tho. VAR is a right joke
moyes is doing bits
Watkins should really have scored the penalty, so we did lose the draw. However, that VAR decision...absolute shambles. We talk about consistency, the same type of foul on Watkins against Sheffield, not even checked for a foul.
Offside should only be if the foot is offside anything else should never be used to declare offside stupid rules
Worst ref I’ve seen for a while (at both ends) still a great game tho
VAR fails again.
VAR is corrupt.
Oh no, wait, look, i saw a highlights real of maradonas goal v england in 86, his shoe lace clipped the midfielder as he did that skill on the halfway line, VAR 34 YEARS LATER,  NO GOAL!
Games been ruined by V A R ..!!!Things need to change or people will turn away from the game...
VAR what is that call, seriously
Grealish is really starting to become a top top player, can’t wait for the proper England games
I have no sympathy for a team full of diving con artists. Grealish at it again all game and Trezeguet flinging himself to the floor at every opportunity, just like against Brighton. Cheats never prosper
VAR has ruined football. For the past 50 odd years we have let the refs and line officials rule. To be fair linos get most offisdes correct, ok some margins of error but on the whole they got them right. Refs often get most decisons correct. Technology in football is not needed. Its understandable for cricket and tennis etc where lbw and base line calls are by millimetres. Football survived without VAR and wil continue to do so. Players are tired of it, all the emotion has gone from the game. Just leave football alone please, without al these hairwidth ridiculous lines of offisides. The past few days I can't even watch a game without some ridiculous decisions by the VAR team. Its completely turned my passion for football off.
Villa will end up in bottom half this season, the expected collapse has well and truly begun
Martin tyler please retire
VAR has taken the offside rules back at least 30 years!
Grealish is made of paper mache
VAR is killing the game.
That win was for Anton ⚒ f*ck Terry.
Football is unwatchable these days
Just as technology has taken over so much of life,  so it has taken over football and thus destroys it.
VAR will kill football, get rid FFS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why cant grealish take penalties
These offsides are absolutely ridiculous. It should be feet only that count in these calls. Watkins had no advantage by having his arm out like that so the goal should of stood.
Aton Villa Fans: Comp[laining all over twitter avout VAR West Ham Fans: Playing the Champions League Theme on repeat.
Good one - thanks - subbed.  Tried to play via Google card link but blocked?
A other arm-offside... Absolute joke.
Petition to remove VAR from the Prem?
2 ex Arsenal goalies both FA Cup winners with Arsenal
Enough with music
Well the first goal was offside there was bird in shot over the line lol
Title should be Aston Villa get robbed by VAR once again & Trezeguet still CANNOT SCORE! 😤
Martin Tyler sounds extremely enthusiastic
VAR is bullshit but Villa deserved that, the amount of times their players fell to the floor after minimal contact is a joke, especially Grealish. Only in the league cause goal line technology messed up
Watkins really had an advantage there didn't he; clear offside
VAR so obsessed with giving the offside the missed the blatant foul on Watkins which caused the offside in the first place! What a joke.
Glorious strike?? Deflection mate calm down
VAR A IS A JOKE
They use Coufal's shoulder as the marker yet Watkins elbow for offside, his shoulder is behind his head in that shot used by VAR. He's onside.
Can't wait to see VAR rule out a header because of someones haircut being offside
So happy var isn't anywhere near the national league totally ruins the game if you ask me! West Ham look a good outfit this year and grealish is a baller too!
When you can be offside by the tip of your pubes, IT ISNT CLEAR AND OBVIOUS IS IT???? AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!
VAR is a joke
Beautiful 💕 😍 xx
Villa dropping like a stone down the table trez can't hit a cows arse with a banjo mcginn looks dead Ming's to slow grealish good look at man city you deserve it
I didnt know you could score with your bicep?
Var must not be used in england mainly because english referees don't know how to use it
Was never a penalty, grealish is cheating diver. Got what they deserved Nothing. COYI.
We always start asleep, so frustrating. 1st goal look Antonio fouled Martinez. He stopped him from moving anywhere with his arm ffs. Trez miss, whatever. Pen miss, whatever. Watkins goal, next season when VAR improves that'll be a goal. But it is what it is. That bag of $#!+ take 3 points and will celebrate like they earned it.
I feel the pain as a Liverpool fan... VAR needs to be chucked in the bin!
What's with WestHam and hitting important penalties wide 😂
That simply isn't offside
VAR is Rigged
Disgraceful use of var
That Fabianski save 🥵
Grealish still chucking himself on the floor?
Lets start calling game soccer becouse its not football anymore. Making rules to justify VAR is hilarious. We don't need tree referees, let cameras do all the work. Even fans chanting is played from tape. What o joke?
Yeah. VAR has destroyed the beautiful game.
Spread the word, there needs to be a time limit on VAR decisions. If it takes linger than 10 seconds to ascertain whether it's offside then it's not "clear and obvious" and it should default to the ref's original decision or favour the attacker. This makes even more sense when you consider that the frame you pause on could change the VAR decision but that frame doesn't always correspond to the precise moment the ball leaves the player's foot.   We as football fans only want VAR to overturn clearly unjust decisions, no one ever really cared about a player being 1 centimeter offside.
Just not offside. Given that it has been admitted that the technology does not exist to achieve the level of precision the officials are looking for, wouldn't it be simpler to make a blanket rule; if the VAR line is required to determine whether a player is onside or not then by default he is considered in line, therefore onside. Instantly removes all controversy from these decisions. Edit: I make those observations as a Liverpool fan, who doesn't particularly like West Ham or Villa.
VAR is seriously detrimental to the beautiful game. We’re gonna be turning into the NBA soon just like the players who need water breaks, I guarantee they’d bring on unlimited subs, time outs everything 🤦🏽‍♂️   Why can’t you leave the game as it was and stop fuc*ing around with it 🤷🏽‍♂️
In all fairness, I think that if the ball would have touched him on the same spot on his upper arm, where the VAR is measuring the offside from, they would have given a handball, hence they shouldn't gave offside. Otherwise yes, the images don't lie, it was offside.
Grealish needs to just come to Liverpool man, you’d be a serious fit for the team 💪🏽
VAR should buy a microscope to measure the distance in inch or even cm.
Lol even though the using his shoulder or the top part of his arm is absurd - the reason his arm is out there is because he's being grappled by Ogbonna - Ogbonna doesn't hold him back then he's through on goal. Either a penalty or let it stand. I'm not sure how else he's supposed to get out of a grapple.
Love how sky didn’t show that cheat diving around on the ground
If they change the rule to only the foot can be offside then there will be no confusion or anger, it's a simple line? Why ain't they implementing it??? The sleeve is a stupid rule, only your feet give you a distinct advantage
Benrahma the man. Artist will develop a beautiful design in the near future for the hammers.
West ham fans we love var. Aston villa fans we hate var.
Football is mostly dull. Remove the excitement from goals and you’re left with a product I’d rather not pay for.
Var killing the game
Next thing you know your tongue is offside even though u got something in your mouth...
0:40 - "Wooooooo!"
Var was brought in to decide clear and obvious decisions when the officials got it wrong. Whatever they are doing it is just making them look like retards
Funny that, Ogbanna wasn't penalised for having his hands on Watkins while the ball is being crossed in. If your going to referee right, let's do it properly. Hard to control your arms when somebody has grabbed one of your shoulders.... 🤔
Villa can blame VAR all they want, but they had the chances at other times to win. The call was ridiculous I agree, but they had plenty of chances, and shouldn't hide only behind the VAR decision.
L
Football was fine for 100 years before VAR, it never needed changing. What’s the point in linesmen if every offside decision they make is scrutinised under a microscope for 15 minutes
I see Aston Villa fans moaning about the goal ruled out at the end but it was offside and also how the hell is 2:00 a penalty? Never a pen for only a 1 second shirt pull like that.
I was all for VAR. Now I've seen how it's used, I take it back. It's destroyed the game I love.
Why is Grealish not taking that penalty??
Who remembers when football was a contact sport
But offsides offside 🤫
These offside decisions are getting crazier every game. Soon they’ll be using VAR to check if their hair was offside.
I am a west Han fan but var is ruining the game
Villa deserves it for grealish's dive. Karma
Surely that is a penalty as he was being held or are they saying it didn’t stop a goal scoring opportunity?? But a foul is a foul is it not?? There was more holding there than the penalty that was awarded
So watkins gets offside cause he’s moving his arms to get away and off a defender 🤦🏻‍♂️ VAR is s joke
Football is ruined
West Ham is actually doing alright they are a good team could be Top 6 if they keep playing like this but Aston Villa is starting to lose games this is why Premier League is Unpredictable you cant predict which team Wins always it’s not easy
I miss martinez at arsenal but he has a brighter career at villa
Grealish is to good said this from last season
COYI
Easiest game in West Ham’s career
VAR measures from the body of the defender to the hand of the striker, its ridiculous at this point. You can't even  celebrate because the chances are that it'll be disallowed. Ruined football.
Var just ruining football.
The way Grealish went down was so embarrassing
Isn’t Watkins being pushed should really be a pen?
Dont see y every 1 is complaining about VAR cuz this time he actually is offside like he clearly is more infront of the man than behind the man so yh its offside but for the goals where like there elbow is offside that's stupid and I dint agree with that but today it was correct and I've asked it from multiple fans that dont support villa or west ham and they've all said offside so it's a unbiased opinion
VAR is so stupid
Why does VAR hate the midlands clubs
Excellent decisions
Imagine blaming VAR when you had chances before to equalise and fucked it you had a tap in from 6 yards and a penalty it’s your own fault
Do you want to know how to become a raging alcoholic? Take a shot every time VAR rules out a fair goal.
They really need to change that offside rule it’s BS!!!!
His head is offside
How we lost this game in never no
VAR saving my sky-bet once again 😆
From the heights to the depths - last season Villa were able to push a ball out of their goal against Sheff Utd and get away with it, and this season an elbow costs them what would have been an excellent goal against West Ham. There's the beauty of VAR for you .... yuk!
Mason Mount's movement off the ball was incredible.
Var get rid off it and fine players who dive
ha ha hahahahaha
How is Watkins offside. He’s not going to score with his hand/arm and if he did it would be handball
Just kill VAR until it actually works
Just here to say that Trezeguet isn’t worthy of that great name on the back of his shirt. He needs 10 chances to score one, maybe he should stick to his first name.
He is offside by his arm, and last time I checked you can’t score with your arm. The beautiful game is no more
Var a big scam for money
VAR ha ruined English football, it was a good idea but it hasn't worked. Today with that dramatic finish ruined, having to wait for a decision then when it comes it's about an inch offside. Regardless of decision the moment has gone.
Coyi great win
I reckon, to spruce Villa v West Ham up just have them both were claret and blue, no rules.
Never offside - from a liverpool fan
Getting at least 2 of these a week now. Ridiculous.
Ha Ha !!
Didn’t expect var to ruin this beautiful game we call football as much as it is
I bet the west ham want to continue playing home with no fans as it seems they don't have that extra pressure
i had a fiver on 2-2
Sooo glad the VAR official was a mighty Hammer!  Grealish.... Stop crying and diving, your better than that.. and please just wear normal socks, you look like a toddler 😂🤣
Just get rid of VAR or let managers or captains have 2 reviews they ask ref they want that checking
Game is a joke now. Measuring centimetres of the shoulder to rule offside. Might aswell just go grass roots and at least enjoy a game
Var is destroying the game disgusting decision
Not going to show grealishs disgusting dive?
Got away with one there . Did not play well at all . Villa unlucky . But we are not where we are by getting every decision  for us . We have been playing well & beating good teams . So deserve a lucky break now and then . Come on You Irons .
This isn't football, but some weird early evening Saturday TV programme called Jousters or something and a blonde woman is jumping up and down wondering if Ollie fisted the Crucial Zone (actually the Pepsi Crucial Zone).
VAR needs to go it is shocking in english football
One of the worst var decisions I’ve seen.
United up to 5th
I’m a West Ham fan and even I don’t like seeing that being given as offside
Fine, get rid of VAR. Just wait for all the complaining when the linesman makes a mistake or the referee's view is blocked, and there's nothing anyone can do.  If you are anti-var in the cases of offside and other binary decisions you are a luddite.
VAR armpits again, why not measure the line from where the feet are? Surely the position of feet are more important to deciding what point in space someone is occupying?
Clear and Obvious??? WHATS CLEAR AND OBVIOUS ABOUT DRAWING LINES THAT ARE LITERALLY A CM DIFFERENCE? VAR needs to go if it continues on this path..
Martin tylers commentary has hit an all time low now
Goals from the hammers 😲😍
I'd recommend that all players shave their heads as short as possible so that their hair isn't offside
Villa players go down to ground far too easy 🤦‍♂️😴 The referee was an Aston Villa fan...
That offside call is one of the worst in VAR history. What a joke
Grelish is overated
It's been a while since I've given up on football, now I'm just popping up to have a laugh with these rediculous offside decisions. It's just unreal.
Why is Greatlish not taking that penalty.. These are pro players but why do they make the cardinal sin of leaning back when striking the ball, because the odds of it hitting the bar or going over are raised once a player does this.  Another ruined game by var but of course the people who know nothing about the game have to continue with it..
What an amazing header by Douglas Luiz, so creative
VAR can suck ass
VAR is a joke.
TWIST AND SHOUT
Referee: Villa, West Ham, let's play a fair game lads! VAR: let me get my popcorn
Correct decision by VAR
The person who created these VAR rules needs to be fired
Tonight that man Jack Grealish showed an absolutely fabulous display of diving masterclass only Tom daily could be proud of  🏊‍♂️
Gutted for Villa. Deserved to get something out of that
Good call by VAR tbf 👏
can you get rid of this cringe intro it does not suit the premier league
So it’s clearly not just “Liverpool complaining” ...who would’ve thought that ‘lol’. VAR is a joke right now  The whole EPL is a joke and the whole world can see it
Salty villa fans loooool. Wanted to replicate liverpool on us? Loooooool. Get real. We are better than you. Your joke of a diver greaselish. Dirty player
Literally no one expects it to be offside, a matter of centimetres. Surely VAR is to help if officials make an obvious error
Ogbonna the beast!!!!!!!
Change the offside rule so that it’s only offside if there is a gap between the attacker and the last man
I don't even like Villa and I feel this is so unfair on them.. this is getting insane
I love villa, their fans have always been so nice. I hate it when they lose  :(
No matter how much we all complain against VAR, they will never get rid of it now. Get over it.
As a Scotsman who loves football of any kind.  I have to say I know our game isn't the best but English football just isn't the same anymore.  VAR ruining every goal with long delays and terrible desicions.  Commentators who don't even react to goals anymore due to VAR.  Something needs to be done to save your game.
Grealish’s dive in this game was so embarrassing
Aston Villa welcome back to reality with Everton 😹😹😹
Grealish going to ground far too often these days, he'll end up ruining his own rep if he keeps up that carry on.
Offside should be based on feet
Grealish is overrated but he’s good but he’s not on the level of Thiago Fabinho wilnadjum that’s just straight facts
Everyone been sleeping on West Ham this season they’ve had the hardest start fixture wise by far of any club and they are sitting 2 points behind Chelsea. Good team
Corrupt league
As a Hammer fan, i genuinely feel sorry for Villa tonight.  That was the cruelest of decisions.  But it's about time Lady Luck smiled on us.  Onwards and upwards the Irons!
Looking forward for Heaton to get back. Martinez still yet to prove himself, gets caught flat footed ALOT!
RIP for those who had Watkins in their FPL including me
Oh my days man he’s onside ffs !!!!
Anyone wanna comment on the amount of time’s villa players dived today? They’d be better off in the Olympics not football 🤣🤣🤣
Remember THe Golden Rule with VAR............When in doubt RULE IT OUT......sickening for any GENUINE Football lover..
If its takes you 2 minutes, a bunch of lines and camera angles to decide something is offside then it's not clear or obvious and is therefore a misuse of VAR
Lol, foul a player in the box, forcing him offside. Goal gets ruled out, and apparently its not a foul. If he goes down for being pulled back, thats a pen, doesnt go down and scores, its given offside.
Villa diving all over the place.
Villa have thrown the past 3 matches
Never understood how you can miss a penalty high. There is zero advantage to getting the ball off the ground in a penalty, you should hit it hard and low 100% of the time, it's only easier to save if it's off the ground
How do they not review the fact that Watkins was getting wrestled to the ground in the box there?😂😂
Absolutely ridiculous
how do you overturn that? should be just benefit of the doubt based on refs decision not completely overturn
Said Benrahma will be as important for West ham as mahrez was to Leicester Mark my words.
I hope that who ever done that var knows that they are wrong and I hope that the ref is embarrassed
I say fu*k var
I don't mind technology in sports but we mustn't take away the thrills of the moment. I don't even enjoy ANY goals now... Like even if they are miles onside, my anxiety tells me not to celebrate as it might be too early....life has already moved on by the time I can celebrate properly... Smh
I'll take the three points every day of the week but ffs that offside just hurts to watch, Watkins deserved better today
Well done West Ham super proud of all the player's. Let's go for the title why not. We are 4 points of at Christmas fing marvellous
bowen is quality
Who else had Watkins in their fantasy team 👿
Ok this offside business with VAR is getting a bit too pedantic now. Soon enough players will be shaving all of their hair off in fear of being offside by a hair. I’ll say this again and again, but the premier league is the only league where VAR causes controversy.
VAR spending 2 minutes reviewing whether the image is offside when the image literally displays a foul which should be a pen 😂joke.
brought Watkins in on my wildcard. Feelsbadman
Why did they put the offside line on Watkins’ elbow instead of his shoulder 😂. Brain dead officials up in that VAR box
Pop
How did West Ham win that?
VAR is making a mockery out of the game and ruining football in every sense as a football fan it’s taking the enjoyment out of watching the games how can someone be offside when a defender has fouled them into an offside position it’s stupid because it might encourage defenders to push attackers into offsides positions deliberately and sometimes get away with it. VAR and the referees prove they don’t know anything about the football rules and they have no common sense
Aston villa threw that away they shud of won easily
He is literally been fouled by ogbonna when he's 'offside' there ffs
Jack grealish fell over when one of the bubbles burst on him realizing it was only half time break
Villas game plan: Give it to Grealish
As a neutral I cannot stand these offside being given. It ruins the game
Can someone explain why that was offside? The line goes from his elbow, but his arm isn't a ball playing part of the body, no?
Goal line technology is the only good technology.  Scrap VAR
Listen right, we can debate whether he was offside all day long from the angle I first saw it from I thought he was, having a closer look I didn’t think he was to be honest. The bigger picture here is the clear and obvious foul. Watkins is not only being held back, but because he’s trying to get away from the headlock, he’s having to flare himself away causing him to be in a potential offside position. If he had gone to the floor there would be no question about it but he’s pulled off well to try and score the goal and it was a good finish. They need to start looking at the bigger picture instead of getting all these random lines out. I don’t know what the rule is anymore something has to change.
The fa has hired a bunch of virgin retards to run var
VAR is ruining the fun of football. Becoming less and less enjoyable to watch as each round of games go by.
Do Villa play McGin and Barkley or can they only play one of them with Grealish?
2:35 The reason why I've given up watching football.  I only went on this video as I heard about another goal being chalked off by VAR so I was curious.
As a West Ham that offside was bullocks
Apparently the groundsmen are still looking for grealish in the turf. Olympic diving and the Olympic stadium
As a West Ham fan even if that VAR decision did go villas way we should of had a en when mings jumped on haller stoping him from jumping
If there was an award for diving grealish would give kane a fantastic battle for the trophy
Said Benrahma appreciation comment.
So many questions and the incident in extra time: 1. Why did they measure it from Watkins' elbow? 2. How is that not a foul on him anyway this making the offside decision unnecessary? 3. If VAR was brought in for clear and obvious mistakes, why are we regularly spending 3 minutes looking  at things from multiple different angles? So many questions about the rest of the game: 1. Why didn't we defend that corner for their first goal? 2. Why didn't we defend that attack for their second goal? 3. How can a professional footballer not hit the target from a chuffing penalty?!?!?!
Oh ffs, another great game ruined by the fking offside rule. Just do what bundesliga are doing. If the line touched with each other its not an offside. Imagine missing a penalty then heroicly drawing your team level only to be denied by a fking mm. Fk off man
The thing is. I really hate var. like i really hate it. But it was a clear offside by ollie watkins. If there wasnt var then it would just be unfair on westham. But overall i still think var should go because it is ruining the game
VAR RUINING THE GAME!!!
West Ham are currently 4points of the leaders. They honestly need to keep Declan Rice.
I am West Ham fan but those VAR decisions are killing football.Same decision went wrong when Bamford scored a couple weeks ago.Shame!
Great result West Ham 😂😂😂🤣🤣👍. Ollie Watkins league 1 striker 😂😂😂
VAR what's it good for absolutely nothing
chin up villa yutes
Gust of wind would knock most of those villa players down! Soft bastards! 😂😂😂
I have lost interest in premier league football now... Thanks VAR RIP PL 💙
Im a West Ham supporter but I have to say grealish is a baller❄️
You cannot score from your arm wtf is this nonsense
It's a good thing they missed that penalty because that might be the worst BS VAR penalty call I've seen yet.
Aston Villa Top 6 Record= Fantastic Aston Villa rest of the league record= Average
Great win⚒
Surely if your counting an arm as offside you should at least measure it from the end of the defenders arm 2:37
didn't even show Grealish's dive that he should of been booked for, absolute disgrace
At least the 🔨 s gave villa a better game than ARSENAL!!!
Tottenham fan here    Wtf how is that meant to be a controversial decision by the VAR it’s a tight call but you absolutely should be able to see that’s onside and no foul is committed
They say If it’s a part of your body that can score which makes u offside so why there looking at lines on the arms is beyond on me really confusing the beautiful game .. might Aswell go watch Sunday league football again back to the roots might even witness the odd punch up 😂
Until the players start saying get rid of it in post match interviews instead it was a soft pen or some you get some you don't nothing will change the best league and has the worst var and refs in Europe scrap the whole thing its become a circus
Regardless of the result. Jack Grealish is a disgrace to football on and off the pitch.  Great talent, but he is diver and a cheat. Terrible role model for the youngsters looking up to him.  If you don’t agree, let me remind you how many other players have had a fan run on the pitch and get punched in the face? I’d never condone that behaviour either, but he is a disgrace to English footballers
💉💉💉💉
On side are of and u carnt scorecwith ur arm so hes on
COYI another 3 points bring on man utd
Stupid VAR just like Bamford decision
The manager of villa is a idiot I dont know why he let the striker to take penalty when in 6 penalties he has taken only 2 he scored. I blame manager of villa for this game lost.
villa very unlucky you outplayed us grealish the difference
Could have been a nice away win for villa😂😂😂🖕
Lol last month people was saying AV will be top 6 this year because they went undefeated in a few games 😂😂😂 wer are they now
Villa got what they deserved. A team full of promise, spoilt by a horrible intent to draw fouls and seek unfair advantages. Pick yourself up and play the game how it was intended you brummie fairies.
how on earth is that offside, nearly as bad as the bamford offside
Var is so dead
Can everyone stop complaining about VAR recently. It was shocking before but now they’ve got it right. Offside is offside, no matter how close! Now, let me enjoy this beautiful beautiful game 🥳
Penalty taking this year like fifa 20
Hopefully VAR doesn't end up doing more harm than good to this beautiful game
The only reason Watkins is in that physical position is because he is being dragged back by the defender, he's trying to get free = FOUL. The line on Watkins also looks like its more on his bicep than his shoulder = VAR ERROR. As well as the fact that the ball has not been kicked yet on this frame . HARSH.
Var should be allowed 1 minute max to come up with a decision or its a goal. Ok im a villa fan and this one is hard to take and take I will but come on, was it down to the sleeve on his shirt, really? If you do not think Var is ruining football, replay every goal scored by Liecester in 2015 and see if they would still win the prem!! Just how many goals can they chalk off, how many very thin lines do they need. What is wrong with the Man being infront of the defender not what he is wearing. West ham got a lucky win tonight but fair play to them..
My retarded cousin would catch out that watkins was clearly getting fouled so what’s VAR’s excuse?
Var has ruined the game big time and fans who ain't deluded can see you can't even celebrate a goal anymore and decision making is really poor needs to change big time or get rid of it players and fans will fall out of love with the game over it . It's also boring to see by the time a decision is made from it and this thing of keepers not able to step over line when diving for a peno is crap what do you expect a keeper to do it's basically letting the opposite team score for free and anyone with football knowledge knows this
Forget VAR.  More should be said regarding Grealish     theatrical dramas , he needs a red card or 3
COYI ⚒⚒⚒
I love this game so much 🤩
ogbinna is pushing him offside. i call foul
Can’t believe how the one thing we all asked for since Lampard’s goal v Germany is the one thing that’s absolutely ruined the best sport in the world.
VAR = The Destruction Of Football. Abolish it now.
Boy did we ride our luck! Sometimes thats just what you need though & i have no doubt that this will drive us on to beat Utd on Saturday evening.  COYI
Don't recall so many penalty misses at this point in the season, need a few lessons from Shearer, Le Tissier, Henry, Sheringham... Showing my age here ⚽⚽⚽😉
How did West Ham win that😂😂all there attacking players and amount of money spent and there dominated by villa 😂😂
The offside line was pointing to his bicep & not deltoid muscle
Was was the best league in the world not no more scrap var my dad 60 and he loved football until var.
The battle of former arsenal fa cup winning goalkeepers
Hate the new offside rules what can he do about his arm 🙄
Harry Kane & Jack Grealish are the 2 biggest divers in the league but them being white n English means it's no problem.
Watkins is being held when he’s running through so he’s wriggling his arm to get away which was why he was offside. I feel like under those circumstances it should be a goal or a penalty.
Why am i the only one talking about the fact Watkins shirt was pulled in the box before he scored?  and they go and check VAR why wouldn't the check that?  its a joke.. as a villa fan i have seen my team play better than the last 4 teams yet we lost.. we dont need to improve just a bit more luck!
I felt tight for ollie Watkins at the end like 👍 if u did
what does benrahma have to do to start
Villa robbed today !!
West Ham will bottle it and end up down the bottom half while Tottenham win the league...
RIP FOOTBALL Love From VAR 😞
the guy in the VAR booth could have drawn the lines to show him onside, and no one would have known if it was right or not. basically, the guy can just draw lines arbitrarily and decide which way he feels like making the decision, when it's that tight. utterly ridiculous system that is destroying the game.
Gives us good memories that these 2 are commentating together after fifa destroyed the game by romoving them
Beating West Ham isn't for Everyone 😂😂😂😂
Villa is top of the league material. It will click into place sooner or later. West ham, I thought they had a better team, just another stonewaller pl statist.
Elementary my dear Watkins.
Play acting divers got what they deserved this ain't football
Benrahma instant impact!
Bloody VAR is killing the game
How's that not a foul on Watkins from Ogbonna?
No idea how an arm or a hand is offside, given that they're not part and parcel of the game of football..
Funny how they don't show Grealish's blatant dive..
As a West Ham fan villa where the better team but that ref was absolutely useless he was so bias towards villa
Games gone
The VAR guy must be a bloody blue nose
Jack Grealish is such a joy to watch
So enfuriating that watkins missed a pen and got nothing for fpl
Grielish is an embarrassment
Jarrod Bowen proving to everyone what us Hull fans new from the beginning. Class player
Bloody VAR
People blaming VAR need to realise it’s literally not the problem the problem is the offside rule VAR just follows the rules 🤦🏾‍♂️
come on you irons? lol
Arms should not be offside.
Grealish loves a dive.
Var is ruining football so much I hate it
Grealish = cheat ... Up the irons
Karma for being a diving Poundshop David Beckham.
What a shambles of a game😂😂
Aston Villa were out classes tonight
Grealish is the goat from a Liverpool fan
Fabiański is having the best season of his life! COYI!!!!
Subscribe to my channel if you think Aston Villa will stay up this season
Villa robbed of a goal, absolutely awful ref and the var was abismal
That was NOT offside, VAR should be taken off football , it's killing the game.
Not an ideal performance today but 3 points that we earned through hard work today. Coyi ⚒⚒
No-one wanted this offside bullshit, absolutely no-one. These inept suited tossers have ruined the game.
He's literally only offside because he's being pulled, am I right? If he was wearing short sleeves there then the defender couldn't pull him and he'd be onside. That's ridiculous.
If west ham started Benrahma it would've been 3-1
Grealish deserves a better team he's too good for villa
Grealish your good but your just embarrassing yourself diving like a child every 2 minutes
Everyone slating VAR and while I agree it's ruining the game that's not the issue most of the time. It's the ridiculous rules or how they're being interpreted. That and when VAR isn't even used...
Jack grealish belongs with Tom daly in the GB diving squad!
Jack is a good player, but he needs to stop eating grass
West ham just missing a cb, a cdm beside soucek, a lw and a cam. Villa need a while new defence
Whoever was in charge in stockley park needs to be sacked by the morning. How they didn’t see Watkins being wrestled leading up to the disallowed goal is a joke. It is as clear as day that it’s a foul. I’m not a Villa fan but that decision is a joke
2:00 and people complained about the Welbeck pen being soft and him making a meal of it (he didn't)
Good game
UTV up the VAR ⚒
Martinez was backup at Arsenal and went to Villa who are better and starts unlucky they lost though
Imagine Grealish playing with top tier players surrounding him 🤯
That’s what you get for cheating. I have zero sympathy
Villa were flopping around all game. Deserved VAR to screw them over
Comeon hammers, this season is ours.
villa deserved that VAR decision against them after the amount of times they dived
We now have a situation in the game that's ruined it completely. Even if VAR is no longer used you'll have people saying "If VAR existed we would have won", the game is in complete disrepute. It will never be the same again with or without VAR. Going back to human eyes from Refs and Assistant's will not work either.  Well done to all those involved who thought it was a fool proof system.
VAR making these decsisons are so stupid
Barely a few seconds from his start of the second half Said Benrahma gives a goal pass to Bowen
Var is bullshit
I swear VAR hates us😟😡
Watkins was offside by a hair's width on his eyebrow.
ROBBED OF A GOAL, ROBBED OF A POINT ALL BECAUSE OF A IRRELEVANT ARM THAT HAS NO ROLE IN THE GAME
can we stop giving offsides that are a toenail off ffs
Anyone else think this commentary is awful?
Villa smash us 3-0 at home, yet lost 2-1 at West Ham, someone explain that? 😞
*Why tf does the arm count for offside when it literally says that scoring with the arm doesn’t count the goal? .-.*
At this rate it’s not even the best league in the world only in terms of tactics and quality of teams cuz var isn’t problem but how they use it like 1cm lol
That was never a penalty
Where’s all the 😡 at?  If you know, you know 🤣
Villa team of divers
Hahah well done West Ham
Screwed against Brighton last minute and screwed again today. Well done VAR great job.
Me: VAR 🤮
I hate var
Villa crying about VAR but were more than happy  when it didnt work for  Sheffield Utd  which would of sent villa back to the championship
liverpool fans moan about VAR and all the haters start saying its excuses and so on etc etc, but when it happens to "their" team, they moan about VAR.. talk about hypocrite's. be in liverpools shoe's, they have the worse VAR overturns in the prem when it comes to VAR going against them.. then you get manchester united who are loving VAR, as they have benefitted more than any other club since VAR has been in the premier league.
Could have a whole highlights video of Grealish play-dancing on the floor.
Cheaters never prosper. That’s what you get for cheating and diving the whole game Villa 💀
Mings is useless
The Beautiful game no longer exists
Less goo Benrahma🔥
Wow how boring is modern day football, VAR so boring
Getting tired of seeing those grid lines. Get Rid of VAR once and for all.
Unlucky villa deserved a draw at least grealish is actually class running around the pitch
What part of "You can't score with your hands" does the Premier League not understand? Edit:For everyone saying it was with his shoulder, I get it but I just think the rules are ridiculously tight
Aston Villa: We're gonna take a dra-... VAR: No.
everyone can say what they want about the offside decision but the refereeing in this game was woeful
We struggled to get the win, we didn't deserve it but that's football for you
VAR is a shambles
Spain without the s 😔
watkins was pushed by ogbona so that put him in an offside position stambles from var needs to be sorted out
Newcastle will beat them ⚫⚪⚫⚪
Why do they never show the slide when the ball is released alongside the suspected offside ?  I am getting bored with the technocrazy decisions.
Watkins was pushed offside and even then it was only his hair offside
When an attackers feet are not in front of the defender it should not be ruled offside
Imagine being Watkins
West Ham were against 12 men what are villa fans talking about 😂 also u wouldn’t even be in premier league if they used var last season for Sheffield’s goal hahahah don’t talk about bad decisions.
We keep showing all the people.who thought we were gonna go.down this season wrong COYI 🔥🔥🔥💪🏽
Var is pointless if your not going to put it to the right use
People don't see the only reason Watkins put his arm out because he was being fouled. It's a penalty. You cant disallow the goal when it's actually a penalty.
VAR is actually a joke 🤦
Look, no hate to the ref, it’s his 15th game but, he either is really that bad, biased or blind because West Ham were fouled a lot from my perspective but we still didn’t deserve the win. Sensational performance from Villa but the ref just hates us I think lol.
This offside rule is ridiculous they need to draw a line on it
VAR is absolutely nonsense. What's the point of celebrating goals anymore? All the joy and euphoria has been sucked out of football.
VAR=LMAO
Grealish is like Beckham
I don’t think anyone in football likes to see these offsides being given by VAR
I think we know why martinez warmed the arsenal bench for 9 years, he’s an awful keeper. Hope heaton makes a speedy recovery and picks up his form from last season before the injury as he was actually one of the best players in that 19/20 team
I’m a West Ham fan and feel Villa were robbed here. We weren’t good enough tonight and didn’t deserve a win.
prayers for the villa kitman for sewing an extra large club badge on watkins shirt 🙏🙏
3 things that are certain in life: 1) death  2) taxes  3) Watkins scoring 0 points when I captain him on my fpl team Edit: thanks for the likes might as well start subbing now so i can reach 725 subscribers
Watkins goal should not be an offside... having the elbow 5cm in front of you opponent does not give you an advantage against him..
Var is a disgrace man
Villa back to doing what they do best
They’ve cut it from these highlights but the penalty for Watkins earlier in the play doesn’t a villa player handle the ball? Bounces up and hits his right arm surely that would negate anything after that? Little confused as to what the rules are now 😂😂, I know he missed it anyway
⚒ A draw would have been fair..
I know villa focused on defending primarily during lockdown, but I didn’t realise they only focused on defending. A missed penalty is always terrible, and that trezeguet miss is probably the top 3 worst misses of the season. Also dreadful refereeing for the Watkins goal, not only was he not offside but the only reason he was in that position was because he was blatantly fouled. If villa had a more clinical ram and a better penalty taker that’s 3-2 and if var did it’s job instead of making the wrong call like it does 80% of the time that’s 4-2
aston villa dont deserve grealish
Man i hate var !! Im not a supporter of either of these teams but this needs to bugger off ! 🤬
I don't know why fornals starts he never does anything good
Jack Grealish is overrated.
If Bamford vs Palace was offside then Watkins is miles off.
freakish acctually dives so much in the game he was literally stood up at one point the rolling on the for the next without being touched ffs 😤
WhAt CaN I Do To gEt FaNtASy pOiNtS wItH WaTkInS
What is the keeper moaning about on the first 😭😭😭😭
Wow a VAR decision goes against Aston villa. FACT Aston villa are the only team that haven't earned their spot in the league this season having robbed Bournemouth thanks to failed goal line technology
Pathetic. Slow in attack awful at the back. Dean needs a slap for tonights performance
These Highlights Is Getting Boring They Show The Goals So Quickly And Its Annoying
I don't understand why grealish isnt taking pens-
Ogbonna clearly pushes Watkins into an 'offside' position. VAR idiocy yet again!
West ham had to do this last season to keep Bournemouth up and villa Dow lmao
Var is destroying football
You could see the disappointment is Watkins when it got ruled out hands can’t score goals  var is a joke
The villa team are cheats
How many dives from villa
Grealish is so talented reminds me of hazard back in the day
Anyone know if grealish had 2 shots on target
Football has become a joke to watch.... Shameful
Guys here we have it now when we have to go to school the teachers will tell  us to be smart and have are hands behind are backs 👀
RIP to all the people who captained Watkins 😂😂😂
Aston Villa deserved all this karma just for that Grealish dive alone
How can an UNPLAYABLE part of the body be offside ???
Var is ruining the game
Grealish, good player but he’s a bloody cheater.
Never ever a pen.
Who else is a Liverpool fan
Offside should be for the foot not the shoulder...  I am devastated :(
What a bullshit match. Villa totally deserved it, how is that goal disallowed. AND IT WAS A PENALTY, ogbonna had his arms around Watkins neck! They didn't even check the foul, they just checked watkins' t shirt, not the foul. Don't get me started on the decision. West ham fans should not be bragging at all about this win. They should keep quiet after scoring with a shoulder, and having 2 shots on targett, wasting time, and fouling just to stop the other team. Villa totally robbed of 3 points, let alone 1 point. What a codge of a game.
2 minutes ago, Whattt!!!!!
Who would of thought after 10 games we’d be above city, arsenal, united. Great win
Aston villa's start was a freak and so was their result against Liverpool . They've lost 4 out of the last 5 .
This season is so annoying idk who to put in my fantasy football team 😭😪
West Ham have been blessed by the gods this season but I’ll take it as a fan
This season is so unpredictable guess that's what makes it interesting
At this point theres been more penalties missed then scored this season😂
You can't score with your arm so why is that offside. Var love man u.
So strange that VAR actually got a last minute decision right 😩
Big 3 points for the hammers , very good performance
Var joke
J g is a cheat.
CMON YOU IRONS ⚒️⚒️
The ref was an embarrassment today.
Villa paid the ref and still couldn't win what a tense game
The good old struggling Aston Villa is back!
Grealish is a top player
That is not offside
Villa could have been top with last games had they won but bottled them both. Also Newcastle game might not go ahead so instead of looking comfortable at the top will be in bottom half soon at thisrate
Another penalty missed that could have led  a team to getting at least a draw
Ogbonna has the same amount of open play goals as Aubameyang
I have nossing to say about Ollie Watkins performance today 3 opportunities 3 sank you for hearing me out
It's not football anymore
The real reason why Watkins missed a penalty and had his goal ruled out for offside was because i captained him on my fantasy premier league team Edit: since this comment is getting lots of likes can you turn them into sub’s
Villa against top 5 this season - 100% win rate ... anyone else, bottle 🤦🏽‍♂️ Jack Grealish too good though!
Grealish could be such a great player if he keeps his head in the right place
37 views 130 likes, what is YouTube smoking now
Freakish is absolute class
Not a great day for Watkins I hope that doesn’t effect his confidence,he was getting it pretty good. Since this comment got some likes,let’s turn them into subs 😂😁
West ham are crap
West Ham up to 5th. Fair play, I thought they'd struggle a lot more this season.
var needs to go, ruining far to many games.
Watkins should have stayed with Brentford a much better club!
didn't know West ham's badge is blue...
HowDidWeNotWinThatGame FC.
Villa deserved the VAR decision against them after that Grealish dive, went down like he was shot.
West Ham are football terrorists. Look at the expected goals of both teams 😭😭😭
FIRST TO A VIDEO but I’m disappointed
The west ham player pushed Watkins offside great thinking
Hi
West Ham are actually so confusing as a team
Var is bollocks
VAR is an absolute joke!
Omg they actually got a late var decision correct
What a finish
Just how did villa not win that game
Omg 91’ disallowed
Everything is working out for chelsea
VAR disgrace to football
