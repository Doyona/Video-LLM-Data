5:01 what is this shot😂
The Warriors GM is actually selling
You can't use the first few games of the season to predict how the rest of the season will go. It doesn't work like that...  Jazz went on to finish 37-45, not 61-21 Lakers 43-39, 16-66
rewatvhing these with years past is crazy
What’s the name of the song at the start of video?
This don't age well 😂😂
Simply genius! And yes, I tried what I read the other day and it was mind blowing to see her writhing with pleasure and ready for anything. It started when I learned to last at least 30 minutes go’ogling the latest in Greyzar Drinbo's PE Solution and now she keeps dragging me back lol
Yep thanks for this, I tried what I read the other day and it was mind blowing to see her writhing with pleasure and ready for anything. It started when I learned to last at least 30 minutes go’ogling the latest by Greyzar Drinbo and now she just can't have enough
4:25 this did not age well
lakers made the conference finals
Lakers part~somehow we made the wcf 😂
Jazz : 34 - 47  Lakers : 43 - 39
Bro is roasting every player and every team in one video
Then all hell broke loose as the playoffs started
8:02 who knows maybe the lakers would comeback and make the western conference finals by beating the defending champs and one of the best teams in the league record wise 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
I come from the future, the Lakers made the playoffs and took out the Warriors
You said the Lakers had no chance of making the playoffs. You said “Let’s not get carried away here,” to the Lakers making the playoffs. Well, not only the Lakers made the playoffs they made it to the conference finals. You really got that wrong. 😅😅
lol at Kawhi stretching in a game hes sitting out
8:05 that aged like milk lmao
lakers really made the playoff. well they are out not but they still made a good run
Well the Lakers indeed made the playoffs 😂😂
Looking back at this and seeing the lakers issues then to now conference finals is remarkable in itself
"The Lakers might even make the playoffs. Well, let's not get carried away. "  Now they're in the conference finals lol
this did not age very well   bucks: bounced in first  nets: destroyed  jazz: lottery team  lakers: conf finals  cavs: bounced in first  blazers: 3rd pick
It's amazing to see that now, during the conference finals, the Lakers are the favorites to win the tittle
I guess how you start the season doesn’t matter at all. It’s how you finish!! 💯
Who’s back here when Lebron is in the western conference finals😂
Lakers in the wcf now
This video didn't age well
seeing this now is crazy
8:02 "The Lakers can even make the play offs. Well let's not get carried away here". Well, the the Lakers did :)
The Lakers just sent Memphis to Cancun and are in round 2 of the playoffs. Damn.
Who's here after Lakers went up 3-1 against Memphis?
Great video, just a bit too early on the season. Now on the playoffs a lot has normalized
Tis funny cause the Lakers actually made the playoffs
Lakers made the playoffs
“Who knows, maybe the lakers could even make the playoffs. Well let’s not get carried away here.” This statement didn’t age in the slightest.
I hope jxmy takes back his last statement of the video since lakers are in the playoffs now 🥶
“The Lakers could even make the playoffs” This aged well
Who’s here after the Lakers got the 7 seed
Anyone watching this after the lakers made the playoffs 😂😂
This is why we shouldn’t predict things this early in the season because almost all of these things mentioned have not held up
8:05  POV: Lakers are the 7 seed currently and above .500
Coming back to this video right before the playoffs. The season got crazier.
This ages badly lol. The jazz kinda stink now.
I come from the future: The Lakers are in play-in territory after the trade deadline Update: The Lakers won their play-in game and are the 7th seed
crazy that the season is still just as wild
this is by far the most irrelevant video now
Watching this after the trade deadline is even crazier lmao
0:07 Anyone know what this violin part is from?
Now the nets got no kd and no Kyrie just a lil bit of bench Simmons 😅
It might be February when I'm watching this BUT I knew when I saw this, I had to click it. New subscriber BTW!
oh boy this aged like milk
jxmy, do a video on the cheapest nba championship in nba history
The part when he said "lets not get carried away" got me dead💀💀
The kings are 26 and 18 the clippers are 24 and 24 the knicks are 25 and 22
How the lakers doing now huh???
Imagine Zion and victor wymbyama on the same team
bro how many ads
If you take the top 5 wwe wrestlers and the top 5 nba players and switch their jobs I still think NBA players would have trouble doing pro wrestling then pro wrestlers having trouble playing in the NBA (: specially when you watch NBA games where someone is always open bc NBA players defense is terrible
I cheer for the Hornets. Someone please send help. I would like to file a restraining order against almost all my sports teams.
Wiseman, the roughest of edges.
Lmao seriously, Steve Nash got shafted. There isn't a coach alive that could get that dumpster fire back on the rails.
The fact that he didn't talk about the kings...
Did anyone notice that the cavs get lighter and lighter the more you go to the right at 6:50
LeBron going back to Cleveland
Hot take. We as fans need to cool it on the klaw and Anthony Davis and other athletes getting injured they can’t control it. We just sit at home on the internet
Lakers been balling since you posted this 🤣
The Lakers sure are turning this around.  AD has been phenomenal lately!
This video is his weakest. Jimmy should know that it's not until all star is where we'll see who the teams are contenders. *Jimmy then pulls the stats of every after all star stats leading to playoffs.
The way this man says things out of breath is comedy gold lmao i love it
keep that same laker energy
6:49. How dare you put the blazers name next to the nuggets logo.
Anyone notice how at 6:51 he has the photo for denver where it says blazers?
It would be very Warriors like to win the NBA Championship with a start like this. Make some more history and break some more records while they are at it.
My Celtics are back we will see how we keep going bucks are always good to man
now I know why you have 2.18 million subs.
Mann I knew Mitchell was getting good since last year, I would be losing to the jazz in 2K22 , ON ROOKIE!! 😩
Doncic SGA Giannis Jokic Embiid >> USA
Start doing collage basketball videos
Can you make a video about Steph not getting calls when he gets mauled off ball?
Can SGA get his respect??
How tf did I miss this upload??
hot take : not only is this a weird nba season is been a weird season in all sports so far
Can you make video on Dwight Howard on making the 75 list? Thanks, if you ever see this.
Honestly this year's nba is so so so competitive
it was too eary in the season to talk about that warriors are trash and blazers are rolling few games further it is completly different
Nash deserves netter
It amazing how good poopy teams are 3 weeks into the season, only 72 more games to go…
Always a good day when you catch a new Jimmy vid!  🎉
Always a good day when you catch a new Jimmy vid!  🎉
Jesus is KING
Bro you should make a video (comment guy here with a suggestion) on The Worst (on or boring) NBA season ever. I can't remember one.
PROMO CODE DON'T WORK FOR SHIT BRO. NOT PAYING FULL PRICE TO SEE A NO LAMELO HORNETS SQUAD. TELL SEAT GEEK THEY FUCKIN UP.
Does anyone know Jimmy's favorite team
Jimmy, there's a guy on Instagram saying that Kobe never changed or shaped the game in any way and that the first 3 chips he won are there because he had Shaq carrying the team. He also said that he only took Jordan's torch and stayed elite
JxmyHighroller  changing the atmosphere on the NBA... stop these players from carrying and traveling...lol
go blazers!
Beat at the beginning of the song?
I’m disappointed, was hoping to see my kings in this video.
“Suit up my guy, my fantasy team is in trenches!” 🤣🤣🤣
wait till he sees the kings popping off
SACRAMENTO KINGS-INGS-INgs-ings
Spurs aren't like that doesn't matter whos the top pick they wont stop trying
My poor Lakers bro 💀
Didn’t talk
I love how he showed clips of Luka and he talk about him classic
This is way better than the stuff on TV keep up the good work SUB
finaly it's highroller time again oh yeah Leeeettss gooo
And bol bol
No one cares about the nba
why is nothig said about lukas performance
Song name at start
Song name at starttttt
Song name at start pleaseeeee
Let's not get carried away 😂
Only watching the NBA on YouTube to catch the highlights and commentary videos…priceless 🏀😎
Damn bro I watched this a week after it came out and none of your facts are r True. Not bringing you down, just saying that is how volatile the early season is
song name at the very start pls
😂😂😂😂 by the grace of God
Well looks like your half wrong and half right about the warriors going to have a better season and my lakers well they still have a chance
Ain gon I did not like Luka love so much but I reminded the 1st 10 secs 10 times nice
No mention of the Celtics? I know it's not a surprise, but still. DOMINANT
What about the kings man
Sad
Nobody talks ab okc
3:45 They're the first defending champs to start 0-6, not the first team in general
So every top player rn puts up stats like a broken 2K myplayer
Since the Lakers might go 16-66 that means an 38 year old Kobe led Lakers could be better than this Lakers roster
Still nobody talks about my Kings…
Jimy, can you make video on Dwight Howard basicly playing PG in his Thailand debut? So much fun to watch :D
I need Brons face at the end on a shirt
do a video on luka doncic
Warriors will bounce back.
6:48 Margin of Victory - Number 10 spot Blazers with Nuggets logo? :)
You can't buy a NBA championship GS signs Durant
I just have one question tho…. Are the kings back? 😊
I'll be happy if any of the underdog teams won the championship this season. I want to see another team winning the chip. Not another Warriors, Lakers or Bucks championship.
Rate these nba takes:   If you dont have defensive skills but you at least try to defend it is better than a guy like donavon mitchell who has a large wingspan, athletic, and agile who doesn’t try on defense and doesnt put much effort in it.   You dont need to be good at scoring to be a good player, take dennis rodman for example he offensivly isnt much of a scorer but what makes him good and important is his defensive skills and rebounding, you can be valuable to a team no matter what your skill is  You dont need to be athletic to be good lets drag nikola jokic into this, not fast, cant jump high but he is a 2x mvp even though he isnt athletic (speed and vertical wise)
Is there anybody like jxmy that covers nfl stuff?
how bout them kings
Let’s go kings baby
Yooo jimmy the editing and production of your vids is insane now compared to when I first started watching, keep up the good work bro!
all this for the celtics to run the east again and win the chip
No mention of the 76ers?
The Celtics play the Bucks at home on Christmas
Crazy cause luka is having a crazier season average more of everything and more wins 😊
Imagine Victor Wembanyama and Rudy Gobert; 'Les Tours Eiffeil'
and then kd completely shits on his teammates 💀
why are there so many commercials, like literally two in the video and another two by Youtube
Steve Nash is not a good coach and if you're implying otherwise you're weird lol
I think the Celtics will have a better 8 man rotation than the Cavs when Rob comes back. Tatum, Brown, Rob, Smart, Brogdon, Horford, Grant Williams and Derrick White. Plus Pritchard and Hauser are snipers.
You picked Kawhi Leonard in fantasy. Bro! That's on you!
As a Kings fan, not sitting 12th is feeling real good rn 😂
i miss the videos where you would put a bunch of stats that nobody has ever heard of before
you forgot the #1 pick that was projected to go #3 who has been setting all kinds of records and is talked about as possibly making the allstar team as a rookie #gomagic
I wanna see Westbrook go to the bucks and join Giannis I think that’d be a real nice duo
Go Blazers!
It's the changing of the guard
Mitchell has always been good, its just that rudy always fall off when it comes to playoffs and mitchell always have no help. Hopefully he will get the help he deserve in cavs
Imagine if the warriors get Victor
Love your videos
W
UPDATE: We are now first in the west. -Blazers
A clicked faster than donvan Mitchell to the cavs
Critisism on Khawi is not fair cause no one knows how he is comin back from this serious injury. I know he loves load managment but he really doesnt have to play 82 Games with one knee
“My fantasty team is in the trenches” literally 😭
I was hyped about the Spurs starting hot but then they got brought back to Earth, but Keldon Johnson is still on fire and if they can get that Victor Wenbaya dude or whoever!
I will say, when Kawhi was on the Raptors the year we won the championship, we gave Kawhi all the "load management" he wanted.
Uh what about the Celtics?
warriors just need to make it into the playoffs kerr knows that
Wembanyama needs more muscles if he´s going to succeed
Kawhi is a disgrace to basketball.
noticed something different in the way Jimy talked during that video. He seemed more invested somehow.
I aint even worried abt the warriors curry is popping off once we get it together we could win another chip
@Jxmyhighroller do you ever fuck with telegram or was that a scam
lakers and gsw are just collecting checks at this point. no way you start a season that badly and sit on the bench laughing fooling around with your team. Lakers are a super team lol its embarrassing
And if you've watched the Mike Brown Kings at all, they look like a real threat to push 50.  Sounds crazy, but if you watch..............
Been waiting for @jxmyhighroller    to upload a new video,,,, and man I watch a lot of youtube content but i'm telling you,,, jxmy's my favourite youtube star,,,  Probably the best youtuber alive
“the lakers could even make the playoffs” HAHAHAHA
Davis more feel like grandpa than lebron is
Whats the of the classical song in the intro?
Calling the nba better than ever is laughable
You doing a seat geek promo after what just happened really suns up the chaos
Anyone gonna talk about Bol Bol?
The three smartest decisions in Cavaliers history: Drafting LeBron Resigning LeBron Trading LeBron
Did the thumbnail of Steph and the ref come up in the vid at all???
Bro when is the video about Victor ? :)
Westbrook is good at being the sidekick and will never win a championship trying to be the hero. Kyrie and Lebron did it because Kyrie accepted his role. Any team Westbrook is on will not win a championship because westbrook cant swallow his ego and be the right hand man to score points
Cavs are a team! Lakers are a all star game roster. If a team is not full of players willing to give the ball and do everything for the win, as well as know each other well, then this is not a team it’s a bunch of dudes having fun.
Your voice is so annoying
Jxmy coming with the passion in this one! Love the vocal volume rising hahahaha. "SUIT UP MY GUY!"
Bruh when I seen lakers 2 and TEN!?!?!?! Yeah that mf bron not even playing is he and if he is this should be clearly shown to him that this mf is getting pushed all the way to the back and needs to fight his way back at least into top ten or that retirement gon be looking real nice by the end of season
Lakers are trash
Am I crazy to worry about the Cavs after they just dropped their 5th loss in a row??????
Maybe the lakers will trade for Zion, pelicans draft the next great big man and the lakers get an injury prone ball of potential.
Luka is just insane, I know it is the beginning of the season but averaging 34 PPG 8 Assists 7 Rebounds, and 2 steals is insane. Literally almost averaging a triple double.  Edit here: Luka is him, Luka is himothy bro.
Great video as always. You do quality work!
Celtics still going to win it all
Over reaction season is upon us. All these YouTubers making these early season reactions that will surely age well.. smh
3:18 It’s sad how much I felt that 😞 Love you Jxmy!
Kyrie just posted a link, show the man some respect
Celtics are taking it this year! We’re on pace for 60 wins, and we just took the lead from the bucks! At least that prediction got 1 thing right!
Nah my fantasy team in the trenches fr!!! Dammit Kawhi..
The only normal thing is Luka in MVP discussions
I have to agree. This is probably the most interesting NBA season I’ve ever watched. In the past decade, you can already predict which teams or who’s going(I’m lookin at you bron) to the conference finals and championship. Now, every team is on each others throats and no one’s backing down. This is the most diverse and unpredictable I’ve ever seen the league.
Chum Buckets
What’s that sad melancholic soundtrack at the start when the vid turn black and white
THERE WASN’T A GRAPH
Can you make a vid on what it’s like to be a westbrook fan. He’s my favorite player ever but I’ve been heartbroken for a while. Scared youngins will remember him for the wrong reasons
LOSE 😂
Being a Bucks fan, living in Utah, with a stepdad who's a Blazers fan, I gotta say, this start to the season has been pretty wonderful for my household.
consistent jimmy ???
15 games into 82 game season
I like how Denver just doesnt exist lol
If victor gets drafted to the warriors I'm gonna be fuming
I love your video style. Can you LeBron James versus Kobe Bryant, sort of the same way you did LeBron James versus Michael Jordan??
Lebron will go back to Cleveland💀
Blazers were a +8000 to win the championship now there a +4500 the drop is crazy lol
Everyone sleeping on the kings, they have a really good shot at making it to the playoffs this year and have some of the best team chemistry and mentality in the league currently
Andd the jazz have lost 3 straight lol
Great video
I may get heat for this, but if the Lakers end up with the worst record in Lakers history with current holder the 2016 Lakers (Kobe's last year with a blown out leg and a bunch of rookies), we may need to rethink if LeBron is really better all-time than Kobe if those don't already have Kobe over him. I remember when media was killing Kobe for his last 3 years with the Lakers but look at what we have right now...
If the warriors keep playing like they did last game or the game against the cavs they have a large shot. We could finally see their full potential on court looking as great as ever. They just have to keep it that way instead of having the worst bench, the most fouls, and the most turnovers of the league
And the Kings are good!
need a video on the 153 kings vs nets blowout lol
This vid got me hyped idk why
Hawks???
BRO, your seat geek ads need an update. I'm so tired of hearing the same ad every video lmfao
This season is crazy, everybody is beating everybody
Remember when the league vilified the Spurs and took Kawhi’s side when Kawhi was randomly sitting out and ignoring teammates? And now people are finally starting to realize, oh, Kawhi might be the problem.
3:19 had me dying I couldn’t breathe😂😂
Great video as always, but not a word about the MVP or the Celtics who reached the Finals last season?
When a team that has LBJ on their team is horrible...I get a warm and fuzzy feeling inside.
The hawks never got mentioned
Simply..... Good times for NBA fans 😁😁😄 Smile and wave....
I clicked faster den my mind could think to watch this video 💯
Lakers will make the playoffs
Do the warriors have Finals hangover?
Im a blazer fan and before the season I thought we were gonna tank another year lol
Luka's handles is like Kyrie's but slower and more efficient.
as a lakers fan its actually worse than ever🥲
He sounds so mad yet so haply and i love it
Cant wait for the pistons to lose tons of games this year! 3 wins is enough...please no more!!!
Any word on who the dad is? Blake or Durant
This season looks even better than last season!!!!
I feel bad for curry he averaging 31 but his team not helping 😭
that last shot of Ja says som...
Great to see the new generation of basketball begin
The Jazz are now 10-6 Jimy...shii ain't gon work out for emm this season
Its definitely a weird season but to call it better than ever is a huge stretch. I guess if your idea of basketball is prue offense it's cool but all I see is a league that's putting up all star game scoring which gets boring fast when paired with the softest defense possible
As a Cavs fan, I didn't expect their win now move to actually be mildly effective. Contenders this year? Probably not, but damn are they fun to watch.
Bosh should’ve been in the list. Not AD!
I guess the Hawks don’t exist anymore
in this video you sounded like that dude from total drama island
Jordan laughing at the warriors 😂
Lmaoooo these nba mega rich players are acting like a teenager at their third job. Calling out whenever they want as if they’re not getting paid millions of dollars to destroy their bodies. Get out there and play!!
Lol the Clippers are a joke…Lakers have actually won a championship in the last 4 years
James wiseman was a bust. Feel bad for golden state. Hopefully they can get someone to really up their defense
Lauri Markkanen🐐
Y’all watch jimmy gonna be making a video in March about how miraculous the warriors comeback throughout the season will be don’t count the dubs out yet
Yet doesn't change is how soft NBA refs are
u hate the celtics fr 😴 and u jinxed us in the finals nikka
It will never be better than the 90's. Facts.
Watching your videos is more entertaining than a full basketball game.
*Thats….sad.*
This is the most energetic Jimmy I've ever heard
one thing is for sure. predictions are BULLSHIT
Wwww
Well since KOT4Q and you made videos praising the Jazz we haven't won a game lmao, losing to the Wizards and Knicks. We're regressing to the mean now🤷‍♂️
Wembeyama TO PELICANS BABY
Jimmy just made me realize how likely it may be that Zion and Wembanyama are on the same team next year… 😅
Just checked...my G-A-S meter still says zero...
Hope this video doesn’t jinx anything
The g league lakers
Idk, it's kinda wild when you actually watch those 0-6 games for the warriors, some really questionable officiating early in the season. But yeah, they'll figure it out along the road
Stupid video
You really missed an opportunity to burn the hell out of Nash with the picture of his face looking all crazy.
Warriors go from really good to really bad to really good to really bad Bros like a flip flop
Lol
Honestly I'm verry glad for Markinen... On the other hand, I'm sad for Porzingis fading to obscurity
The Timberwolves are so irrelevant Jimmy doesn’t even talk about them, and that says a lot :)
jesus loves you
The production quality of Jimmy's videos are insane
Hey Jimmy, I love your videos and your channel, but it would be better if you acknowledged Kyries “distracting antics” as the hateful comments they are. I’m a big fan, love you Jimmy!
This team (Nets) has got NBA reddit looking like the front page of TMZ 💀💀💀
Here's one last one, guys....the Boston Celtics are massively exploiting a loophole with the shot clock.
Kawhi is overrated as hell because of his work ethic and he never plays 🙄
I have never seen an NBA champion team become garbage the very next year....jeez (except for maybe comparing 1993 to 1994 in the Bulls season....or 1998 to 1999 Bulls).
I'd say LeBron jacking up over 7 threes per game and shooting .200 while playing ZERO defense is also hurting the Lakers.
This video came out the same day that the warriors had a blow out win lil
All teams with 10 losses after 13 games are statistically only going to the play in now. At most last playoff team. Lakers and Warriors are basically gonna at most be the first play-in teams if they recover well.
It hurts so much to watch the warriors burn man. That's my team since 09 bro and this shit is heart breaking
Ironically the warrior blew out the spurs and nets lost the to the lakers 😂
Umm, I guess Lakers, Warriors and Nets are all tanking?
Love your emotions big dawg
Denver will take over.
Jazz will fall back to reality eventually. Wizards were the #1 seed in the east in the beginning of last year and then later on they weren’t even close to making the play in tournament in the end. I can see the jazz just being above .500 around the 7th or 8th seed. Similar to the clippers last year.
You gotta do another Vid, replaying the fact that NBA Players are Scoring more Points than ever before from ur old vid and compare it with the start of this season. e.g.: KD is currently 8th with 30.6  PPG thats just crazy. I mean its just 10 games in the season but the stats they be scoring is crazy.
Promo code doesn't even work. Clown behavior
love kawhi
How long do the promo code last ?
Bro didnt talk about the celtics once. Best team in the league without Rob. Lets talk about it.
Whats the beat at minute 7?
It’s always a great day when jimmy uploads goated YouTube channel
Dude didn’t even talk about the Kings lol. We’re coming.
Yo Jimmy I wish seatgeek was Available in my country
Im impressed this video made it into Trending
The problem is sports betting.  The bookies are telling the refs which teams need to win.  It's corrupted.
In January we’ll really see who’s sticking around 😭 Can’t really get to hype over the underdog teams early. Ex. Wizards First month in 2021 season
I can’t watch grown men behaving like 12 yr old jerks anymore. I’m done.
What if the warriors are just trying to get wemby 😳
“i don’t get it but go blazers” YES SIR IT FEELS SO GOOD TO ACTUALLY WIN AS A BLAZERS FAN
Kevin Love 6th man of the year 🫡
Free Kyrie
Fuck the warriors
babe wake up, jxmy posted
Must be Lauri’s disc golf career that led to his surge of dominance👀
No cap tho I remember that injury ass season a few years back. *THAT* was a wild ass start
Fucking crazy man, its feeding frenzy out here there’s really no telling who would win games
lol no way you just tried to make it out that steve nash didnt deserve any blame.
What's this year the most similiar to in past NBA seasons?
I realy enjoyed your story telling ... that pause on the LAKERS was LIT ...
Shout out to the Celtics since you didn’t lol!😉💚☘️#18
"The lakers can even make the playoffs... No lets no get that carried away" this shit got me dying lol
I agree this season’s start is off the charts and I have been a NBA fan for 52 years!🥳   💚☘️#18
Cavs lost 5 straight. But they are dangerous
Bro u said this last year
I know the man is "out of prime" but Lakers win less than 20 games in this season would really hurt Lebron's legacy.
Clicked this faster than Giannis sprinting for that alley in the Finals
Bron gonna take his talents back to the Cavs
Warriors are the First team in NBA history to start 0-6 on the road???? What?!?!?!?! Bro, stop lying or learn to read your facts or properly edit before posting, please
I am thinking the Euro Basket improved Luka, Giannis, Markennen, and Jokic so much they became beasts this new season. Everyone was resting, they were getting better. Iono, just a thought. Alos, I think the refs waged a secret war against the players.
Wait you have KL in your fantasy team?.... your own fault.
Wait no graph?
Exceptional commentary 👌 lol!!
Should have posted this a week ago tbh
lakers winning the chip mark my words
Why he only mention one of the top five scorers in the league right now... no love for Luka and Tatum? or Embiid and Shai
Can’t wait for your special on De’Aaron fox and the kings turning things around to finally make the playoffs
Lebron NEEDS to retire to protect his legacy, he's fuckin killing himself right now
We’ve been cooking up something noice here in Utah. We are very use to being under estimated. We are up next. Also, Lakers suck butt
Never put your bets on Nets and Clippers. One generational talent who is super super entertaining: MJF!
Nah this season has been crazy fr
The fact Joel just went 59-11-9-7 in one game makes this even crazier
5:17 implying that NBA Reddit doesn't always look like the front page of TMZ
bud kawhi has a degenerative knee
3 alltime great players. mr glass and russell statpadder.
Maybe they actually made it that the bottom team goes to the g league so thats why they aint tanking
My laker squad isn’t making playoffs in this form
No mention of the Hawks? Damn, okay.
Boston Celtics as of today have the best NBA record of 11 and 3. Two of the losses to ONE team. The Cavs
Oh you poor thing, your fantasy team isn't good because a real life human has a real life injury that keeps reopening every time he tries to play
I’m just happy to see my boy Lonnie Walker thrive with the lakers  He grew up in my home town ,and I watched him a ton ,including when he won a state championship his senior year
Its a looooong season too early to be making assumptions
(John 3:16,17) "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him." (Romans 10:9,10) "That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
3:46 this is flat incorrect. 2015 6ers went 0-11 to start season on road and there are others as well.
Isn't it weird that Luka Doncic wasn't even mentioned once?
Pistons are also 0-6 on the road. 0-7 now
Ion know sum bout this Jimmy guy feels racist
Jimmy there is a video in your ad
Man I love your stuff. Btw would you try to predict the MVP this year
i mean the warriors are losing but steph is playing out of his mind
Now suddenly Lebron wants to go back to the cavaliers. It’s like going there to find something and by time you get there it isn’t there anymore. That’s why it’s so hard to buy a championship.
3:17 I forgot all about kawhi I thought he just left the nba lol
Personally I think we are witnessing an Era end.
The hawks were practicing at my gym the other day. Sadly I had exams so I couldn’t go
Cavs vs. Jazz in the finals would be so fun to watch, from start to finish.
This is why I love the nba it’s always unpredictable
It ain't defense it's reffs allowing travels, 90% of these highlights are travels
Great video
3:20 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Great delivery, had me dying
The jazz are a bunch of unwanted players, theyre are trying to prove something wrong
Plz keep that energy bout the Lakers u gone 👀stupid wen they make the playoffs
No it ISN'T, "Better!"  The refs are WORSE, there's more freakin' "Hangin on the rim," there's blatant "TRAVELING" that isn't called, there's WAY too much, "Offensive Fouls" that aren't called on the, "ELITE" players... Etc., etc!   Same ol,' same ol,' except....WORSE!!
What’s the name of the song that plays during the black and white part I can’t remember it and it’s bothering me so much
When the Warriors draft Wembanyama, it’s over.  The NBA will just end.
❤Praise God!!❤ Not basketball  And not the players
EU taking the league. Love it
Really wished I lived in the US. Bookmakers still think a fully loaded all star team is guaranteed success.
Jesus died for our sins so that we can go to heaven. He payed our price. Put your trust in Jesus Christ and he will grant you the gift of heaven. 💯
Hey jimmy - can you do a video on what teams would look like if NBA players had yo play from their home teams. That could be cool.
As a warriors fan I don't mind losing this year to get Victor Webenyama
Any day jimmy uploads is a good day
The Warriors are getting Wembanyama aren't they?
Hearing Jimmy say go blazers makes me happy 💯
Bring back the original song
So nothing about luka putting up 95 a game?
The Warriors are the first team in nba history to start off 0-6 on the road...? That doesn't sound right lol
love the video style  👌
Magic beating golden state as someone from Orlando is dissapointimg
ok
Who is jimmy? And how high is he rolling?
Here again after JE dropped 60-11-8-7
*0-7 😗
This man said the Lakers are playing like dog absolute dog water 😂😂😂
Ben Simmons HAS to be the biggest bust ever!
One day away from Embiid masterclass !
Jazz fans, can y'all even be truly happy about this? Yeah sure, we have learned they got a star or two in there, but isn't there a point where y'all just go like "ok chill bruh, we got the memo, time to tank now!" Because as good as this start has looked, there's no possibility they even ever reach the WC Finals, so what's really the reason to be happy here? Y'all were supposed to be contending for Wemby/Scoot and that was cool😭
talk about the Hawks
Do a "follow up" part 2 nearing the end of season and pre-playoffs to compare. Like "pre-season odds" vs "during season odds projection" vs "post-season/pre-playoffs" odds.  This is wild and hella fun, but it's 82 games. It's a long run game. Marathon not a sprint. So let's see who endures the whole season winning and then the last most important part, not choking in the playoffs.
as a basketball fan ;what year so far !!  .. as a lifelong laker fan what the ffffffffffff
#18 on trending rn!! Let’s go jxmy!!
I’ve seen this every season bro
Just like the NBA media, Jxmy finds a way togo whole entire video without even mentioning the Phoenix Suns
I think I speak for every basketball fan on YouTube when I say. You post, we don’t care WHATS on this will take precedence
as a famous Italian rapper would say "I admit this video has a flaw" it ends
What makes the Jazz an excellent team is that they don’t have excellent players
Go clippers
Bro it’s football season shhhhh
The Miami Heat have bought championships. If you draft the players that you’re paying, it doesn’t matter how much you pay them, it’s not “buying a championship.”
I luv U Jimmy
I want to say that around only 3 teams with odds out of the top 10 have ever won the championship, if the jazz win, some people will make a lot of money
Give SGA some love, I beg you
Intro: It was the Best of times, it was the Worst of times
I waited 2 weeks for a 8 min video. Still fye
Jxmmy I love your videos and never click on anything faster than when i see them. I have a video idea for you. Cover teams that are stuck at being mediocre. I think you could turn it into a cool vid! Love you man ❤
Lauri Bird
0:23
my man just forgot to say that Luka Doncic is already the MVP
I do not expect the Cavs and Jazz to remain this good going deeper into the season. Nor the Blazers. In the end the strongest defenses will be the cream that rises to the top.
aNd We AbSoLuTeLy LoVe It man stfu
Thank you Jimmy 🤝
4:11 aye lonnie nice tho
Also dont forget those crazy Portland game winners already, they have like 3-5 of them atleast Mad fun to watch  Also, kinda under the radar but Pelicans are also mad fun to watch and I never cared for tjem in the slightest
4:05 never heard jimmy so emotional.
The only thing that hasn’t changed is Lebron doesn’t get foul calls, if he got the mj treatment, he would have been pass 40k points already
Man the dubs are making me sad, Curry is averaging 33 7 and 7 and they are 5-8, like if he doesn't drop 40+ they lose and what makes me even more sad is klay not being himself, i just hope he gets back to his former self somewhat, like dropping 37 in a quarter would be insane but let's just see how it goes.
hii
Sure?
Always same comments.    I swear just parroting past comments.
Less goo new vid
As a Celtics fan how did you not mention how much we’ve proven
bro I think I like how jimmy makes his voice like that when something’s making him mad . Do that more bro😭😭
It's almost about chemistry
That lakers comment at the end was the least likely fr lol that's crazy
this man acc makes my day better with these
Clippers are solid, pg is going off, soon as wall gets more minutes he will go crazy too, and whenever kawhi is ready, he will be crazy too
LETS GO CELTICS
Go Blazers!
I just want my Pacers to win a title this year.
keep making fun of the Lakers my boy you're setting yourself up.
I got Seat Geek and now I'm a Geek for a seat
This video is hilarious.
I literally muted espn on my TV to watch this video on my phone.... That says alot ijs
Didn’t surprise me about the cavs tho because even last year that team was looking quite dangerous. They already have one of the best defenses and now I’d say they have a top 5 back court so yeah don’t sleep on them and the jazz were the biggest shock to me but that’s what happens when players know their roles and a team that is being well coached
Don't mind me, just a longtime Kings fan passing through that is watching them have what looks set to be another season that will end with them probably ranked 20-something in the league. But hey, maybe they'll make the play-in tournament in the West due to other teams falling apart!
So much content haha
Saying Kawhi is “one of the great players of all time” is well, laughably dumb.
YOU WILL BE CURSED FOREVER... THE LORD SHALL NOT HOLD YOU GUILTLESS FOR TAKING HIS NAME IN VAIN !
Lakers 3 and 10?
4:07 the guy on the left looks like JJ😂
Imagine thinking the jazz were going to be bad.  The debate shows got you again!
Don’t sleep on the kings
I hope I don't jinx anything 🤞 but almost all of the star players being healthy across the league has been my favorite thing about this season. The best of the best competing out there and when the winner is crowned there will be no excuses....hopefully
That last lakers quote hahahah
How do you not talk about the Celtics being on pace for having the best offense in the history of the league?  Difference between 1st and 2nd is greater than the difference between 2nd and 9th.  All this coming after being a bad offensive team last season.   Their offense and defense did a complete 180, not to mention Rob Williams still hasn't taken the court yet.  I feel like you missed out on an interesting and relevant part to the start of the season.
Can it be possible? More teams now have caught up with the Warriors in 3 point efficiency. The Warriors still play good defense, expect the plays are quicker now because all it takes is one pass or two to a wing player. And that player can just shoot a 3 quickly even with a hand in their face.
The hawks are better than the cavs by a mile
Lebron is about to go back to the cavs lmao
Jxmy when you gonna talk about the NBA officials watching your video then deciding to call carries lol we all know where that came from and you’re the goat
I understand preseason projections for the warriors to be high, but why do we keep saying the nets and clippers are going to be elite when they have issues that have hindered them for 3 years now
Warriors bought a championship last year what are you talking about?
The thing about the warriors was that they were so subpar until around January when they all of a sudden caught fire. Wouldnt shock me if they did the same this year
The warriors are not the first team in NBA history to start 0-6 on the road. That’s just an incorrect statement
I feel warriors will flip it around and still be probably top 7 but the lakers I think there’s no turnaround coming
Lakers ain't making no playoffs
Dropping some Eric Satie Gymnopedie no 3, I love it!
I knew this video was comin 😂😂😂. Y’all warriors fans must be upset knowing it’s over 😂
Yeah this shits weird, didn’t think I’d see the Nets, Warriors, or Lakers losing so bad to start the season. I feel like it’s a curse because this is really the first year I’ve sat and watched full games, and every game I do the team I want to win loses 🤣. Especially my Nets, have never been so pissed at players on my own team 💀
C'mon Jimmy. Money can't buy you a NBA ring but look how easily the Nets and Lakers dethroned Le Cirque du Soleil as the most enticing acrobatic clown show in the world.
Love your videos no better channel
Nobody talks about kawhi sitting out because he can’t control when to get injured and when not to😂. It’s not kawhi’s fault. This is what separate players from fans/youtubers. Fans don’t realize that everytime a player steps on the court, they are putting their body on the line.
Can the Kings get some love? They're doing better than ever and all the losses have been CLOSE. As a Kings fan this might be our best season yet, hope I don't jinx it though 😭
VW going to rockets or magic
What is this video supposed to be about, what a load of twaddle. 👎
3 mil this season. Go get it!
the year of the great tank...... hahahah🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"The NBA is back and it just keeps getting better." Says the guy who's not watching the Lakers games.
Tatum playing at a mvp level.
Nvm we 0-7 now
Jazz only getting Ls when someone on the other team enters God mode, like Embiid did yesterday.
I'm all for seeing teams nobody expected anything from doing well and also all for attempted super teams blowing up and failing miserably.
another great video
If only Jimmy would make us longer videos, just as I get into the video, it ends, please make a longer one man, other than thought I've loved all the content
Jimmy hates the Warriors and I don’t know why. What did they do to you?
As a Grizzlies fan, we are EATING!! Ja’s playing MVP level ball, Desmond Bane is blossoming into the all-star we knew he was, and we’re a top 6 seed without Jaren Jackson Jr or Ziaire Williams!
Nobody cares about African tree hockey
People still watch the NBA?  I just watch jimmyhighroller videos lol.  F Lebron btw
Fr bruh
Not a word about Dallas? Ok that's a hate for me.
Literally a day after posting this Embiid goes for a 60 point quad dub, wild times
Lakers can still go 72-10
The nba is better than ever? That’s a bold statement. Nba has been trash for the last 5-6 years.
NBA won't let a generational talent go to a small market , it'll be Houston or LA or Brooklyn or something like that who gets #1 pick in 2023 I guarantee it
And now my man embiid just scored 60
Poor man’s Draymond took me out 🤣🤣🤣
Not talking about the Celtics is an L
and not even 24 hours later Embiid dropped 59
What I just saw is amazing! 🏀🏀🏀and I made a compilation of the best NBAyt basket shots
Jazz nation, let’s ride🙌
Stephs quietly playing a MVP season so far but the team is ass lol
The Wemby sweepstakes lmao
Anthony Davis was just working them for a whole quarter
Luka goin crazy tho
How did you do this entire video without mentioning the Boston Celtics? They're shredding opponents with record offense, and Jayson Tatum is a top 3 player. Come on dude 😂
I got the jazz winning the whole thing lol. I mean when I put $50 on it, it would win me 25k so I said why not 🤷🏾‍♂️.
Love the change of pace in this video. Your rant was great, thanks for the great videos!!
Can you do videos about bad screens? The NBA has been doing that a lot lately. Example - Curry’s three pointer against the Cavs to win the game. Klay was doing illegal screen and no call was made. Thanks 4 your time.
Always good stuff on this channel. Wild season so far!
Shi is crazy but at least everyone is healthy that’s most craziest thing so far to me
I can feel it on Jimmy's voice! 🤣
What’s actually crazy is that 8 players are averaging 30ppg or more
Jazz are already regressing. They will be .500 or worse before the new year
The only thing that might happen to lakers this season, is Lebron being the #1 scorer (points) in NBA history. They will not go to the playoffs, nor play in.
Dem refs was watchin dat last vid on bro🤣
I love your videos man
You did Anthony Davis so wrong 😭😭😭😭 “clinching at his back every time a defender looks at him the wrong way”
Jimmy you’re the GOAT 🔥
every single video bro, is truly a masterpiece
LeMao James has his dream team. And it sucks. I love watching LeMao lose…I might even start watching basketball (only Lakers games) again JUST to watch the Lakers lose 😂😂😂!
Kyrie being a distraction… NBA media created Destruction
Steve Nash def played a major part in their shortcomings.
not as wild as the vikings bills game just insane
We ALL know what fucked up the Warriors chemistry
Lakers just bear Brooklyn with lebron on the bench.
What if the warriors tank get weben mamahama and trade wisemen for gp2 🔥 or 🗑 move
The deck is getting shuffled, and i'm here for it
I don't know if you know what tanking means but tanking means losing where I am in Reality
Can’t believe the Bucks had Pat, Jrue, Giannis, and Chris sit out and still win against OKC. I guess it’s a good time as any to get the bench some game time.
If the Warriors pulled off the No. 1 pick I'm waxing every bit of hair off my body
Grant was a great pick up for the Blazers. He’s been ballin
The best part of the video is at 6:08 where it showed preseason rankings and the Lakers predicted as having 44.5 expected win total LMAO. Good GOD
and then joel embiid goes for a near 60 point QUADRUPLE DOUBLE
Jimmy u need to get trap sax back
this dudes not gunna be a generational talent
Anthony "the N*#@#" Davis
I like how insecure and xenophobic are african-americans when it comes to Doncic and Jokic that they are not even mentioned here, hilarious. Just back to back MVP and the league's greatest talent. But go Blazers i guess.
The way the Cavs are playing, LeBron might decide to go back to "bring another chip to the city of Cleveland" 😅
Nothing much to say... love ur Videos bro <3
All this and the Knicks are disgustingly mediocre. They aren't good. They aren't bad. They just exist to torment me.
Not Prime Dirk 😂
Kawhi Leonard has robbed the sport of basketball. I don’t think this has ever been said about someone on the level of a 2 time Finals MVP.
The LA Lakers are purposely losing to get victor 😭😭
Lakers look worse then the days they had sacre & DLO with Kobe. And they have ALL STARS. Sad
Hot take, ja isn’t even top 25
As a Brooklyn nets fan, the highlight of the season was seeing Steve get fired! And clapping the Knicks by 27 n beating the clippers. 🧘🏿‍♂️
Think I can explain the Blazers one: based on us having basically tanked last season and not settling the new defensive strategy until now: loads of people didn't pay full attention and claimed Dame was washed rather than being injured and being Dame (ie not being willing to ever take time out), which meant people being very cautious or outright clueless in predicting this year. Add that in to the return of Dame, the strats being implemented and some pleasant surprises, the underestimation aids the team a lot, too
Bucks in 6
YOui forgot to talk about the East. lol I guess they don't count.
Lakers can even make the playoffs. "Let's not get carried away" 😭😭 I'm a laker fan y'all, but this caught me😭
Boston beats warriors un 6 un the finals
Ha...truth.
SGA is playing at all NBA levels right now. He’s stepped up on D and has been insanely efficient.
Jxmyhighroller is the perfect channel to Watch when you eat
Poor man’s Draymond Green 😂 another way of saying you’re trash
It's madness in mayhem, everything is like starting to flip the script literally.
warriors defense jumped off a cliff head first to a pike where it'd land
Warriors really be missing gp3 and porter jr
"YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO TANK!!!"
Jazz 2023 champs guys
This season has been full on!  I'm entertained regardless of my Warriors slumping. 🌞👌
It feels like a Paradigm shift to younger players going off and the older stars are cracking but it’s too early to say that
Bron should have never gone to LA.
Embiid just sonned the Jazz
I swear he hates the Celtics lmao
you do know that the Nets still have a better record than the Lakers 🤔
hi
That lakers making the playoffs joke at the end was funny lol
Dean wade beat my high school in the state championship and our big man still had 20 rebounds 🥱
All the most woke teams are losing haha
Jxmy mentioned the Pacers?  Maybe there's hope for us this year.
This dude has a talent for marking YouTube videos like no other and I’m saying that as a long time subscriber who doesn’t even really watch basketball like that
The players that were too young to take over the league the past few years are finally learning how to take over the league as the teams with superstars we've been watching for years are starting to enter the twilight of their career even if there stats don't show otherwise.
The celtics are pretty Much the only team that's as good as we thought they were going to be
Amaxing video, completely crazy what’ s going on in the Lakers, Clippers and Nets team….
No Jimmy this video is hilarious 🤣🤣
*MARKKANEN*
I can't even tell you how much anticipation I have for your videos. 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
These are confusing times
I see Jimmy i click
Nice but since when does tanking start at the beginning of the season? This video will probably look completely different in a couple of months.
It's always a good day when a Jimmy video gets released
Lol the flame session just kept going.
It's because people only think about glitter and sparkles, meaning superstars, and forget about team depth. And The Nets is full of divas, this was expected tbh
How good has Steven Adams been for the Grizzlies! Record breaking offensive rebounding and screen assists
"And Anthony davis clinching at his back everything a defender looks at him the wrong way" 💀
If the jazz make it past the first round I’ll post a video where I shave my head bald
the lakers might even make the playoffs lol priceless
Im surprised you didnt even mentions the Celtics in this vid
As a Warriors fan, I am just glad we came back to the top after being on the bottom and never expected to achieve anything again. I don't care if we tank, if we never win again, Steph has already cemented his legacy...
Warriors should tank for Victor. They gonna be like at best 5-6 seed and lost in the first
ONG. KAWHI NEEDS to play i have him on my fantasy team
Wildest start indeed! They are playing like they are in the playoffs already .
Lmao this came out right before Embiid had 59, 11, 8, and 7 blocks
NBA Season so wild, the absolutely nuts situation in Minnesota wasn't even mentioned. HAHAHAHA.
Kings are funnest team in nba
The Jazz are literally in rebuild mode and they're on top of the wc 💀
Masterpiece of video my boy
kawhi is on my fantasy team too 😭😭 suit yo ass up
Embiid just dropped 59/11/8/7
Theres no way the warriors are winning a chip again cuz that would mean they would have more rings than lebron in the lebron era
"...and Anthony Davis clinching at his back every time a defender looks at him the wrong way" 💀
Why is this so short? I want more.
Bro got me laughing histerically the moment he started roasting the lakers 😂😂
Show some respect to the Warriors, man. Tank for Wembanyama? Naaah. Not ever!
Lakers will be 2023 champs mark my words
We need longer videos from you, Jimmy. We need more!!!
victor wembanyama is such a great prospect that even the defending champs are tanking for him
Jimmy spot on about Kawhi, I think that Spurs were right about him, he was trying to do something like this and they got sick of it. Now just because they won in Toronto everybody tolerate it. But it is getting ridiculous.
If Houston and the Pels end up with the first two picks in the upcoming draft thanks to the Lakers and the Nets, I might burst from laughing.
Where’s your podcast???
imagine if these channels didn't just overreact like maniacs to everything
Bro bro bro don't you compare the Humble GOAT Dirk to the Ego you can smell all the way in Europe Markannen...
LEbron is a big joke this season.
As a football fan wtf is happening but also it seems so cool I want to be able to know, with like 6x as many games it’s nuts too, how ball and hockey do that…  I want somebody to do a breakdown like this for nfl now hahahaha 😝 but this was super cool too, even having no idea what’s going on or much of an idea about basketball at all!!!
Jazz ain't winning nothing. They'll win just enough to miss the playoffs AND miss drafting Victor W. They're basically a franchise that's doomed for mediocrity based on their location. Most great players simply don't want to go there and no one can blame them. Good for them for a great start but they'll eventually go away without a lot to show for it.
luka jordan
Joel just dropped 59, Garland with 51 as well
Nothing better than Jimmy losing his shit over a summary of the first month of regular season NBA. Like, it should be hyperbole or a force performance, but no. It really is that silly of a start to the season. I think Donovan Mitchell is the player I'm most interested in. I never really thought about it, but I kinda did blame him for the struggles of the Jazz. I'm pleasantly surprised by the start. He's really fun to watch.
I like that you didn’t even bring up the Ime situation lol
It’s just 10 games
Proud to be a sac fan in hopes of this comment aging like a king's wine.
The next day: embiid almost drops a 60 point quadruple double, Darius garland drops 51 and 6, Anthony Davis has 37 and 18, Sabonis drops 26 and 22, and Shai drops 37, 5 and 8! What??? 😂😂😂🤩 this game.
.
The season barely started. RELAX😊
i hate nba tanking... it makes it so difficult to believe on regular season
plus, Embiid put up 59/11/8 while Darius garland also dropped 50 right at the time this video was published
Also, Embiid just decided to put on arguably the most dominant single-game performance in recent history almost scoring a 60-point quadruple-double.
NBA is worse every year. If you have seen 90's and 00's, lack of defense these days has made NBA unwatchable. If I didn't have fantasy team, most likely I even won't look game scores.
Cavs are 8-6 already ://
slowly but surely jimmy is turning into these nab analysts who do their best to not be wrong by being on both sides of every team ... the warriors are terrible and one of the worst teams in the league but can possibly get on a run and make a run in the playoffs also the suns going into this season are not good but they're back and can run the west oh and kawai is sitting but the clippers can also make a run .. the nets are dead to rights but they can possibly be a contender if KD can step up..........
Bro posted this right before the embiid masterclass
I play the Jazz music in the background to remind me if the old days
Crazy start of this season. This man deserves a phd in basketball stats I swear. 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪
The hate for Lakers is so real lmao
Trust me the warriors will finish 52-30
I'm so happy as an nba fan to see all of these teams that people used to laugh at just winning and winning more
The Warriors aren't a dumpster fire like them Lakers
with how good the cavs are looking u might just see LeBron go back... LeGoBack
The fact Joel just went 59-11-9-7 in one game makes this even crazier
3:20 i felt that in my soul
5:52 Dude just literally gave up on getting another offensive rebound.
i’m so happy as a cavs fan. we’ve actually had a rough stretch lately but spida didn’t play and i mean we have to lose SOME games
Don’t stress about the warriors they got it
Thanks Jimmy you finally uploaded. Keep it coming as much as posible! 🤘🤘🤘
love the channel and vid but damn near 10 percent of teh video was an add cmon
And after all that, Jayson Tatum will win MVP and the Boston Celtics will win the NBA Finals
I don’t watch the NBA regular season much if at all. But I do watch Jxmy channel and this video brought a smile to my face when I see Lebron who basically goes to teams and assembles mini dream teams and to see them flopping like he has his entire career is awesome. That bubble championship needs an *next to it. Teams didn’t have to travel, didn’t have fans, just shows that is a huge part of a NBA season.
thank you
A 13 games sample size says alot. It says there are still 69 games left. Warriors lost again on the road tonight. It looks like a 0-41 season on the road.
Let's not pretend, that Steve Nash was a good coach
I dont know either whats happening rn just hoping the warriors get back on their feet
No love for the Suns??
i watched the whole 2 ad’s at the end of the video, it’s like a tip for the high quality
As a hawks fans, thx for not roasting us
My team sucks 😭
Incorrect, the 15-16 76ers started off the season 0-16 on the road. Do better research.
"AND A PRIME DIRK NOWITZKI!!" I fucking laughed at the dinner table
A little sad to see you didn't even mention Doncic... The Mavs aren't the best team in the NBA but Doncic is Don Luka... 🇸🇮
Bron returns too Cleveland
pls make more videos jxmy
Great video but I think you forgot a team out west🤔
West is so unpredictable. I don't know who is going to make the Finals.
my fantasy team in trenches too bruh
I'm waiting for Jimmy to be hired by a sports news channel at this point
“Warriors are the first team in NBA history to start 0-6 on the road” That’s not even close to being accurate, and we’re 0-7 now
At 6:51 under margin of victory, you put the nuggets logo under the blazers name. I'm not trying to bas you or anything but just letting you know
Steve Nash and his bro are both on coke. I'm not saying that as a joke.
Tiny Spurs mention at the end is all i can ask for i guess lol
Not to sound disrespectful but honestly I think in USA sports you guys hold on to players for way too long. LBJ is done (as in he isn’t like he was an there are far better players now) Davis hasn’t been good for years and is always injured, Russ is Russ nowadays… like it’s not a surprise when you got a bunch of old aF broken injured players. I’m sorry but they were always gonna be bang average, they weren’t even that good last year and they’ll be worse again next year if they don’t sort crap out
Make a video on how the goats of nba and nfl were going down and now they comin back
Lauri Markkanen for mvp, take them all the way boys!
Being a Bucks fan, living in Utah, with a stepdad who's a Blazers fan, I gotta say, this start to the season has been pretty wonderful for my household.
I absolutely love this vid. The aggresiveniss is a good change of pace of your vids
"I don't get it, but i don't care too" Is my line today... Thanks
Suit up my guy 😂
Imagine if GSW were to get Wemby
4:23 Jimmy confirms Lakers illuminati influence 😬
I swear everyone stays sleeping on the Celtics I love it tho it fuels our fireeeeeee
I was joking about blaming Nash in a comment under Ben Simmons clip.. and they took it seriously 😒
Kawhi Leonard is not one of the greatest players of all time. He had good seasons but his injury/ Load management history damages a potentially greater career. He’s done a lot but he’s become fragile mentally and is afraid to play
I still miss the trap sax 🎷  Saxamaphone *blurp bloot*
Distracting off court antics? Yeah ima go ahead and stop the video there so I don’t bend up unsubscribing
Hot take here  Dwight Howard had a better prime than Anthony Davis and it's not even close
didn' even mention Primo lol
Question Jimmy idk if you answered it, but is Luka your favourite player of the "new" generation?
Bron being Bron with -61 and noone talks about him hurting the team chemistry as usual
Why does nobody ever talk about the Heat? They were the number 1 seed last year so they should get at least a mention about how they're doing atm no?
Honestly i think warriors are fine they won as the 6th seed so its still an uphill battle
As a Suns fan I'd like to thank them so far for the consistency they've put forward amidst the Ayton drama and Sarver saga. Season's been crazy for a lot of teams and am glad they haven't fallen into a pit after that blow in game 7
Never thought we’d live in the world where I who live in CA and a Kings fan could laugh at my friends who are lakers and warriors fans
Is anybody really surprised that Kawhis not playing and the clippers are mediocre? Its literally 90% of their legacies, what elae would you realistically expect to happen?
As long as that man #30 is laced up, the Warriors always have a chance.
The Utah Jazz thing is nutty. You're very good coach quits, no problem just reach into the Pop's pipeline and pull out an absolute savant. Trade away three starters including two All Stars. No problem just make new all stars out of JC and LM. Somehow the Jazz look like they have an even better team than they did but with an insane amount of draft capital. This might just be the greatest and quickest rebuild in NBA history. It is nutty. There is no other way to describe it
woulda stayed first in the conference if Joel didn't drop his big fat nuts all over utah lmfao
Embiid almost put on an quadruple double tonight. 59 pts 11 reb 8 ast 7 blk
Jimmys so charismatic all his videos could be complete fabrications and I wouldn’t care and still believe them
Lakers have put me off of nba this season , Luka is my only hope for the league for me 🥲
:')
As a long time blazers fan, I've been waiting for this for too long
Cavs are doing great but will Mitchell choke again come playoffs??
Let's go Lakers, hahahaha
why does this 8 minute video have an ad run every literal minute? c'mon dude.
GSW tanking for lottery might be a 300 iq GM move
no nash is a bad coach
Wtf this guy at 2.17M subs damn never even realized how popular he has got I've been here for a while
Somebody forgot to tell the Jazz players this was a tank season.
We are in a new area of basketball!
bro did the ultimate nba ad in the beginning
Not surprised about the warriors. The league is evolving and warriors style of play just isn't gonna work anymore. I feel like the big players are getting way more skilled and steph and klay can't just switch onto a big for an easy 3 anymore idk that's just what I think
Bro. Please use some different music.
0-7 on the road our season is over congrats bucks or Celtics for your chip this season
lakers is truly bad this season
Jxmy Droping Low quality Videos.
Little early to say this. Total clickbait haha lame video I expected better
Bucks are winning another championship
Then the lakers beat the jazz w/o lebron
Only 8 minutes? Well I guess it's always a treat when you upload.
I crabbed my pant
Poor man's Draymond Green😂
With all due respect. I don't want to hear about the Blazers. We have this conversation every year about "wow look how well they're doing maybe they've finally turned the corner and are actually going to contend!" And then you wait till the end of the season and they're in the play-in and get bounced in the first round. Every year they come out firing with Dame carrying them and then eventually he just can't anymore and they fall back down to earth. How many times we got to see this movie before everyone realizes this?
love the fact that you totally skipped Lebron when talking about the failure Lakers having now. Like he wasnt the problem LOL
If u waited like 6 hours u could’ve talked about the first 2 50 point games of the season happening on the same day
Please stick to only talking about stats and statistics please :( Your opinion and perspective is literally so annoying that espn wouldn’t even hire you. Dude you’re really critiquing the clippers for having Leonard do what’s best for his body? This dude is a professional athlete and clearly understands what needs to be done in order to have a long impactful career like lebron comes to mind as a example of that. He’s thinking long term for his career in the nba and non athletes like you only wish to be entertained and gain points(?) on your fantasy teams…
you are a bullshitter you can certainly buy a chip
NBA teams are starting to rely on chemistry rather than being a one, two, three man show. All the players in the league are there because they are talented. They just need minutes to prove themselves. Looking at the Jazz, Spurs, Pacers, even the Kings, they are full of hungry, skillful players who want to show that they are deserving of winning and carrying a team.
I mean technically you called it in your last video, that the highest paid team in the NBA doesn’t win chips
"And as always, until next time...." should be inducted in the HOF!!
It's too bad that the Nets, the Clippers, and my hometeam, the Warriors, are in my favor to reach the play-offs but end up not what I was expecting.
I like Russ coming off the bench, he looks happy and doesn't have all that extra pressure. I mean every stat of his went up since turning into the 6th man. Now if l,a. Can trade Russ(as long as he keeps up) for a couple good shooters, they could make the playoffs
jimmy high roller the best basketball yt channel there is no cap
As a Clippers (kind of) fan I just can't see kawhi playing 2,6 seconds per game
"your least favourite g league team" bro stop it, im already crying as a lakers fan
Kawhi is never going to be that guy you can depend on
Joel Embiid just woke up too.
Say Cleveland ain’t gonna pick bronny up
Video I think 8 of asking for a jimmy butler being Michael Jordan’s son conspiracy video
Ong bro my FIRST pick KAWHI has only played like 3 games
like 👍🏽 if you been here since trap sax
You Gotta New Subscriber 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You really lost credibility lying on Kawhi saying he just doesn't want to play. Fine, say he's injury prone, too mentally weak to play through injury, but to say he "just doesn't feel like playing" as if you're inside his body or he told you this himself,  Is the epitome of F*ck boyism
Jxmy is using white mode on google 😩
Imagine the warriors tank this year, get Victor, and come back like how they were last year. Steph and Victor would be crazy!
Welp now cavs are 8-5😂
Jimmy, your the funniest when you rant about certain nba teams in videos! Keep up the great work!
I badly want the Jazz and Cavs to face each other in the finals to prove to everyone they made the greatest trade in NBA history
5 fkn commercials (one of his) just to watch a meh video. This channel is tanking and going to shit
I’m just sorry guys -Lakers fan
A prime Dirk Nowitzki 😂😂 he’s fucking fun to watch Markannen I mean.
nfl is way crazier this year, i say give it some time and things tend to come back to reality
Give the Lakers a chance, Sheesh! 😂😂😂
I literally wanted to commentatr about how there hasn't been a single 50 point game... well Ebmiid and Garland had other plans.
And meanwhile Boston doing what they supposed to do, without Rob mind you. Go Celtics ☘️
Is having a beard now like a requirement to be in the NBA?
Is there an NFL version of Jimmy? Someone that puts together quality pieces like this but just for football?
6:45 why are the Blazers the nuggets
8-6 wizards doing something this year
Your fantasy team is sucks
Hopefully Victor and every other generational talent from this day on leave the team that signs them so that teams stop destroying their next 10 to 20 years for a chance at one dude
NBA becoming WWE with every season...
I know it's unrealistic, but I will laugh like a preschooler if the warriors and pelicans (courtesy of lakers) get wembanyama on the draft 😂😂
I would say the Celtics have the best 8 even 9 man rotation in the league. Definitely the best bench.
6:49 that is a wacky blazers logo
Ayo stop it with burning my lakers like that!!!!!! Though cant stop laughing😂😂😂😂😂
You put the Nuggets logo on the blazers name in margin of victory. Still great vid as always my guy!
You say that like Steve Nash should not have been fired.
3:25 I felt that bruh 🥲
Yeah bro, I traded kawhi after he played his first game. Probably the best thing I’ve ever done in fantasy
Can’t wait for more vids this season
Should've said smth about Luka being insane
nobody gonna mention how well the hawks are doing?
bruh i’m in the crowd on the luka shot
This is the best NBA season
The comedy tho 🤣 Ben simmons looking like the poor man draymond green Uhhh...wheres the tanking? theres a generational talent this draft in victor, Lose! 🤣🤣🤣
Guaranteed Quality Content 🤟🏿🤟🏿
Every 15 games you should do a update on the state of the NBA and break it down in this format.
Bro said absolutely nothing about my Celtics what the fuck
Bro sounded fed up making this video 😂
You don't get it? Really? Everyone is sandbagging to get that super tall French boy next draft, duh?!!
the next video is going to be about the embiid 59 points
He made the same video at the start of last season, I think the NBA is just getting crazier and more surprising every year
Wemby to the dubs would break the nba world
Two 50 bombs in one day
simmons forgot how to play bball
this is so well done
"my fantasy team is in the trenches" I can sadly relate kawai throwing
Ay, I'm just glad the Blazers are competitive again.
Cookie
Jazz a team that’s trying to tank while the Lakers trying to contend💀
Crazy how the jazz and cavs both won huge
The knicks also started off one of the best in the league last year and look where they went.
Mathurin, Haliburton, Hield on the Pacers are looking better and better.
whats the song you use when the "sad" part happens like clippers in intro and nets
and he didnt even talk about luka
I clicked faster than Westbrick turning over the ball
Why you shitting on an injured man. Kawhi isn't just sitting out games.   BTW, everyone talks about Kawhi by literally saying no one is talking about it.
The fact that he uploaded this before Embiid did what he just did is mind boggling
That lebron screenshot tho😂😂
Jimmy uploading consistently lowkey better than prime jordan
Bro is not holding back💀😂😂
Nuggets just being nuggets
That punch messed up the warriors  chemistry 😂😂
These videos always on point 🔥
At 6:50 for margin of victory bottom right why is blazers nuggets fire vid though
imo, alot of teams that were "supposed" to tank probably heard the noise around them and decided to say "fuck you" and ball. lol
Warriors should trade draymond n tank lol
why are you talking like that my ude
I bet Bron wants to get traded to Cleveland back again 😂😂😂😂
I miss the saxophone 😔😔
and then DG go for 51 and embiid goes for 59 lol
We already know the previous nba champ prolly won't start on fire  We know the teams espn tell us will be great will be horrible  We know if espn tells us a team is tanking ITS THE OPPOSITE
Lmao no what u mean is all the teams the media tried to program us were going to be good SUCK and some of the teams the media tried to program us would be terrible are decent or good  WHAT A COINCIDENCE  I don't think there's anything weird about it
“…Make it right” 😂
I don't expect the Jazz to carry on their high scoring ways all season. Remember the Wizards had a great start a season ago and then fell completely off. Are the Jazz that much better than last years Wizards? Maybe, but not by much
NBA!!!
celtics by far have best 8 man rotation… cant compare cavs
This was so funny keep up the good work 😂
Haha Lakers for sure ain’t making the playoffs , let alone the play in
As a heat fan, this relaxes me
Idk if you do requests but I’m at a point where I think Luka’s improvements on defense might be worthy of a video in the near future if he keeps it up
Honestly it’s looking like this is the first season of the new era, let’s call this one the AAU area, or the talented area (not saying people weren’t talented before), or the boruto area (anime fans will get this) but yeah all of the young guys are taking over and the guys that have been in the league for a while are leaving slowly, dirk carmelo, kobe, kd is losing, lebron is loosing, steph will probably start winning but they are losing rn...ja luka giannis has come, joker won back to back mvp, zion, melo ball became the 4th youngest all star trae young is killing it, this is the area of all of kids that grew up with video games and phones watching their fav players and playing basketball 24/7 in programs and people are getting bigger faster stronger with more skill than ever. Victor is gonna break the nba next year. It’s exciting to see. The last area was the lebron era (pre 3 point era) then steph came and kick-started the new area but it was still transitioning. Just my opinions tho
curries been balling tho
I love how Jimmy is so optimistic about the Jazz and the Blazers   Other content creators would just bash them and not take notice. Jimmy comes through again for the more unnoticed teams
Dude we are like 15% of the way into the season hahaha chill
" I mean we've got a generational talent on the line here, loose", made me chuckle so good i starting coughing. Good one 👍🏻
Who watched Embiid's 59 performance after this?
I've given up on Kawhi
Your art of story telling and narration is just unbelievable.
Watch LeBron try to get back on Cleveland 😆
Clickbait thumbnails and political ads are killing my YB nights
That intro was so🔥🔥🔥
The warriorswould be genius to tank imagine have wembanaya and that whole team for 3 years
theres a reason why theres an L on Lakers
Lakers gonna win it this year LeBron gonna do something magical. Nvm It will be russ
Didn’t even mention Philly either
Being a Lakers fan is literally either the best or worst feeling in your life, there is no in between.
Bro imagine if GSW get Victor Web 💀🤯
Yooo, forgot the 2015-16 Lakers lol.
Kiwi Leonard is soft
I put 5$ on the Jazz making the playoffs to start the season, cause it was 5$ and the Jazz never purposefully tank. That bet has me thinking I'm a fortune teller.
I’m not even a huge nba fan but this is my favorite channel idc
Wanna rethink about the nets??
I clicked on this video faster than ice spice putting her hands on her hair
Wildest start to a season and jojo goes out and drops 59
I love how the sixers implosion isn’t even on anyone’s radar because we’re all so used to it. I say that as a sixers fan
I love the passion in your voice in this vid
Nba parity is at a all time high right now , no clear favorite to win the title , teams that ppl said are  tanking are at .500 or above ,  "contenders" underperforming , young guns literally taking over the league , and the rookie class , man its some big dawgs , the magic got one , indy got one sac got one det got one hous got one , not many classes have players showing out like this , sign of the times , the days of bron kd steph kawhi dominating the league are over . Goodluck to your favorite team , happy holidays .Stay warm .
Jimmy trying to convince us that the Cavs are the current best in the league must be satire. That being said I still have the warriors winning the west and the bucks winning the east. As for who is gonna win the championship too soon to call
An unpredictable nba is the best nba
Timberwolves fans:  Thanks for not mentioning the Timberwolves
NBA is back, that means Jimmy's back!
What if jxmy made a wnba vid
As a timberwolves fan I can’t even be mad at the jazz, go ahead and do your thing boys
If the Pelicans get Webenyama then the AD trade might be the only ringless Win trade ever
Garland just dropped 51
How do you fire Steve Nash bro? That's got to be one of the dumbest decisions I've ever heard of.
Y
Man, great job, as allways. But what about Luka? The dude is on fire. MVP caliber so far.
Welcome to the Twilight Zone! 🤣🤣
I didn’t know the warriors entered the wemby sweepstakes, no wonder we suck
7:48 😂😂😂😂😂 I didn’t know either
I bet your watching the warriors now right. 🤡
Calling the Warriors a dumpster fire is a pretty big exaggeration.  Steph is on pace to have one of the best seasons of his career and all but one of their losses were close matches. Disappointing start for Dub nation to be sure, but nowhere near Lakers level of bad.
Everything going on with the suns, i got them winning it all this year. They just look matured finally
People need to get off street clothes back. He could be naked
6:59 this right here is why the cavs won’t win. Not saying don’t have fun they’re throwing champagne off early success. All young teams do this and don’t win usually until they mature up or take that next step. 2014 warriors, did the grizzlies do, and suns last year. But seems like pheonix has finally started taking shit serious like those 2015 warriors; who knows maybe they might have a chance this year
there’s no way gs is the only team ever to start 0-6 on the road
And who'd have picked the first 50point game of the season was.....           Darius Garland
Celtics casually sitting first in preseason odds, and Jxmy ignoring them cuz he knows they're gonna end up on the top of the conference 🤣
Didnt this happen to the jazz after they lost hayward?
“Yay he’s back!! No he’s not..”
Khash money hasn't played and Giannis and jrue are not healthy, bucks are fucking scary.
Killing it as usual, Jimmy!
I have a huge bias here, but I do really think the Blazers are only gonna get better as the season goes on. They just look so good rn
Make a video about benneditch mathurin
New background sound👀👀
3:13 "one of the greatest players of all time" LMFFFAAAOOO you can't be a GOAT with only 4 creditable seasons on your belt 😂
Okay as a warrior fan here. I think the whole nba would hate us if we yanked this year and ended up with wembanyama.
TOOO SHOOOORTTTTT
How about the Lakers just giving the number 1 pick to the Pelicans for Davis... And keeping Westbrook... Jeez
Lauri out there trying to get his 2k rating up
keeps getting better at carrying and walking or travelling
rooting for celtics all season IDC
"Cavs are the real deal" except we just lost 4 straight 😭 Darius just put up 51 tho which is crazy. We can definitely be the real deal with some time. Also amazing video as always jimy i always look forward to them
Lauri brought the movie thunderstruck to real life bros carrying my fantasy team fr
This couple of seasons ,the nba keeps getting weirder and weirder
has anyone ever seen how crazy d3fb has been this season?
Love to see the lakers playing like trash.....but I feel like Ben Simmons needs his confidence back
stop promoting seatgeek its awful
Warriors did just finish a dumb 5-game stretch on the road crisscrossing the country. During that stretch the bench was abysmal but the starters put up better numbers than most any other team. They’re starting to figure it out including winning their last two games, one of which was over the vaunted Cavaliers.
i like this guy so much i went back to like it
Lol season turning it’s head again in the past week
I don’t know why but when he said “I didn’t think the warriors were gunning for the kid” I busted out laughing😂
Net rating and margin of victory the same thing🤣🤣
The Lakers are a dead horse and the nba media is beating the shit out of it. Sadly can't say they're wrong
Here after Darius Garland scored 51 pts vs the Timberwolves
AYYEE I HAVE THE SAME CANCER (Kawhi) ON MY FANTASY TEAM…shit sucks
I love the nba
need weekly roundups like this every week🔥🔥
I don't think the Warriors are the "dumpster fire" you're claiming they've been. They haven't been blown out of any games, the majority of their losses have been winnable, and Steph Curry is playing at an MVP level. Their defense and bench have definitely been bad, but they could easily have 3-4 more wins than they do right now if they just make a few more stops on defense. That doesn't scream dumpster fire to me. That just sounds like a team that needs to tighten up a few things and figure out their rotations.
The Los Angeles Losers
Thanks for the recap bro
There is no doubt that we are living in a new NBA era
You're being f*cking stupid on the Kawhi thing, dude.  The med staff is hyper-cautious due to a CHRONIC degenerative condition. Nobody can just "make it go away" as if Kawhi wants it too or not.  Smh....u turning into another clickbait factory
Trash video
I haven’t missed a high roller video in years
That fantasy team joke sounded like more than a joke.
Its actually crazy how the Warriors refs have just completely turned on them
5:02 “3 baby!!!”  -Lakers Bench
Nah that half court shot from Lb got it💀💀
man i love these vids :)
too many ads
Jazz fan here - definitely was hoping to tank this season in hopes for a potential upcoming star, but this is getting fun to watch! Who would have thought!? 🤯  Love the videos by the way! 🙏🙏🔥
Jimmy the goat
Curry still dropping 33 ppg
How is it the Lakers are still losing & still gets mention more then other winning teams!!!!!
Are we even surprised considering how LIT the preseason was?! 😅😅
Hey Jimmy... I hate to whinge but could you do more content please 🤣🤣
Jxmy turning into Stephen A Smith
Great script and narration! Keep up.
Nah but the warriors turning it around rn
Jxmmy is a staple in the youtube basketball community. 💪🏀
Wow this one went hard as shit
Zion and Wembanyama on the same team💀
If Luka continues his current per game averages in about a month and a half from now, I bet Jxmy will have to make another Luka vid
Me being a raptors fan seeing Pascal start the season off like a superstar then he gets injured cuz slipped on the Mavs court. Now raptors are hit with injuries.  I hate it here
love the vid,  but could you please make a jayson tatum video he jumped to #3 in mvp ladder but no1 rlly talking ab him
Im glad to hear that people are downplaying the warriors,the race isnt for the swift but who can endure  it😀😀😀go warriors.
Those old heads saying that the NBA is boring recently, they are the true boring people. 😂😂😂
what a weird year for basketball and football
Let’s appreciate SGA real quick. Dude is averaging 30 a game
This was a great video because Jimmy didn't get too serious about numbers and graphs, he just ranted and showed his personality. Still want mostly that type videos, but this was fun
Jews reallly trying to scrrew up the nets
Stop sleeping on my Lakers. Stop the disrespect. Ya'll can laugh now but we about to break Bobcats record for worse regular season record of all time 👀
Why does the thumbnail look fake?
To add to the strangeness: Arsenal on top of the league until Boxing Day. Sports have truly entered upside down world this time
I think the take on Kahwi is a little unfair at this point. If his knees are as injured as they say they are why rush him back to the court to only exacerbate his chronic injury?.. I mean I get it, they're paying him to perform but health always comes first. Shoot look at what pushing it too far did to Dirk is all I'm saying. Ppl act like these guys don't have a life after basketball. I'm sure Kahwi wants to play with his kids when he gets older.
Most surprising thing is Westbrook is not even bricking.
I'm just glad the NBA is finally to a point where there are so many good players spread across the league, there is no "super" teams anymore. Just about anyone can beat anyone on any given night, I love it!
As always, great vid.
The intro was golden
Better than ever lol yea right
this is the only guy that makes we want to watch nba
It really pisses me off when Lebron said he need to flop or something. Dude's been doin it ever since his on Miami. He's been one of my favorite players but damn, dude needs to take accountability and become a better captain for his team.
8:05 the face of Bron's mental health
Call tf down
Always a good day when Jimmy uploads🐐
Tell me you hate the lakers without telling me you hate the lakers cmon man 😂😂😂 it’s tuff out here
4:33 three all time players? nah 4, can never leave out the goat austin reaves
"Yay! He's back!" "No he's not" bruhhhh 🤣
If you drafted Kawhi Leonard with your first or second pick in fantasy basketball, you get what you deserve.
It would be super ironic if the pels get the 1st pick because of the lakers considering how they built their 80s dynasty of fleecing bars teams and getting the 1st overall pick multiple times
LeBron gave picks and Zion to New Orleans because he wants to get traded there and win some more easy rings with his son and two generational talents.
Nothing will ever compare to 90’s hoop.
Cavs is on top this season? It's time for LeFlop to return to Cavs to pay back. And end his career as a loyal great player.😂
outdated video
that kawhi fantasy joke really hit home ya know🙃
And the Nets are currently winning so maybe it was really Nash(and Kyrie ofc)... Wolves on the other hand is bout to become a bigger sh!tshow
Nurk scratching his nose at an AD corner three is the funniest thing I’ve seen all day lmao
Lakers gotta trade ad
The Wizards last year started 8-3, with a franchise's best start but barely made the play in... the Warriors started like 18-2 before putting together the ugliest streak of losses at the end of the regular season... but recovered to win a chip. The Celtics were 18-21 on Jan 6 last year before dismantling every team that stand in their way, only to fall to the Warriors in the Finals... This is way too early in the season, the Warriors are turning it around as we speak with a big win against the Cavs (5 or their 6 losses on the road have been a one possession swing). The Jazz hopefully can stay relevant. The Lakers, on the other end, are headed for a short season... Kyrie Irving also.
Imagine the Warriors getting Wembanyama 😭
And Danny agie is pissed
“MY FANTASY TEAM IS IN THE TRENCHES!” 😂😂
I wonder if some teams got scared about Adam Silver watching teams tanking so they told their players to play as best at they can so that they aren't intentionally tanking?
Too bad the refs are becoming more and more of a joke 🥲
Kawhi is on my fantasy team. I’m in last place.
Curry took this post personal about them 🤣… in all seriousness, Amazing video as always Mr.Jxmy ✍🏼💪🏼
As much as I enjoy the cavs Im not sure two 6’1 guards are gonna be able to win to series against the Celtics and Bucks unless Mobley turns into KG
the kings gonna surprise all yall
AD is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
nba now is just for amerika. not worldwide. poor nba
"absolute dog-water"
Boston is also looking really strong rn. Tatum is on fire.
The Timberwolves man, don't know how they are so crap, really thought the Gobert trade will make them dark horses but they are not even close
I would not be worried at all for warriors super early playoff a lot of young guys figuring out the defense and scheme
I’m sick of people making fun of special Ed kids they should really start making fun of people that don’t subscribe to the GREATEST BASKETBALL YOUTUBER OF ALL TIME
8:06 jxmy really did Bron like this
1:44 end of sponser, your welcome.
That's what happens when you don't start Kevon Looney
can't wait to see someone reupload this to their channel having added nothing but a facecam /s
So no comments about Lukas eight 30+pts games in a row?
Cavs are currently losing against the dumpster fire that is the T'Wolves lol can't get crazier than that. But being serious Cavs are the real deal. They are still missing Ricky Rubio who was playing amazingly before the injury just to make their bench even stronger.
so much better watching nba; youtubers who dont need their face plastered all over the video for clout
You talk about these teams like the season is over . They have only played 10% of the games. They have things called streaks for a reason
Here’s my take… stars of yester year are aging. If your past 30 that’s it ur prime is almost up. Dame dolla is grateful to have a good young team.
I think if you posted videos that were 30+ mins or even a documentary. Everyone would still instantly click to watch your video and watch the entire thing without hesitation.
ok waiting for Clique to make a reaction vid
I also made the mistake of drafting khawi in fanasty:( teams chillin tho
"It's better than ever"?????
Ngl Kawhi kinda fell off
no one gonna talk about donavon mitchel gets better without gobert but a jaret allen ant gets worse (4 dunks the whole szn) and the jazz the best team in the whole west
This is a gem, thanks Jimmy!!🏀
7:35 No, don’t lose. I understand the tactics behind tanking, but it just hurts the product of the league. I’m glad that teams are trying to play instead of just throwing in front of fans playing to watch the games. The kid is unbelievable but honestly, whoever gets Victor gets Victor.   There’s a conversation to be had about the league changing up how they handle draft picks to incentivize teams actually trying to play, BUT that’s a whole nother can of worms with a lot of variables I admit
Ty Lue said Kawhi wanted to play so I don’t think it’s him just choosing to sit
Kawhi waiting until that new area come around.
well, when you put it like that . . . decades ago - when newspapers were still a thing and magic and bird were hosting the nba playoff invitationals, there was a detroit columnist who used to put together all these exact kind of tasty little stories from the drama factory which is the nba. highlighting stories like; the utah jazz putting together a low-light reel of karl malone when he came back as a laker... stuff one might never see or hear about any other way.
Lakers on fire right now. Not because they're winning, but because of Jimmy's roasting ROFL
Best and funniest basketball YouTuber in the game 😤😤
Can’t wait to see Wemby and Zion play together 😎
Calling the Warriors a dumpster fire and then putting them anywhere near the lakers is a GARBAGE take. Idc if you lessen it saying “they’ll figure it out” because dumpster fire insinuates it’s too far gone
As Warriors fan, I feel sad looking at my team as they can only count on Steph, Wiggs, Draymond, and Looney for now. Even Klay is troubled. But if I could go through 2020, this is still nothing. I will always stick with them a long as Steph playing.
Good to have you back for another season, let’s get it 🔥
when jimmy uploads >>>>>
Kyrie did nothing wrong. Unreal.
Let's go new video!
Talking about fantasy I have the best team in the league but my entire team got injured this week and I'm on the verge of losing to the third worst team in the league
Lebron: I'm going home
"I just made a video about whether or not it was possible to buy an NBA championship, and we concluded that no, you can not buy an NBA championship. So far this season the warriors are proving to be no exception to this" wow! The warriors are one of the few teams that draft great players, develop them and not trade them away. Who did the warriors "buy" that your referring to? Most of their entire team, and all of their best players were drafted by them except for Wiggins. The Warriors get hated on and taxed heavily by the league for making smart draft picks, then having to pay their players well once they've proven to be great. The warriors actually lost a lot of talented players this year because they couldn't afford to keep them now that they have a championship on their resumes. Your comment is silly and irrational. The Warriors have proven the haters wrong, time and time again.
The transitions from great and depressing  is killing me 😅
The energy in this video is off the charts
imagine if the Dubs did get the number one pick.... 🤯
As a Pacers fan I felt what you were saying, cool Mathurin and Haliburton are looking way better than I ever thought they would but just take it down a notch so we can lose a little more lol
Great video Bruh 👏🏾
aaaaannnnndddd we can safely say it was indeed steve nash that was the problem
Unrelated to the video content but shout or to Seat Geek, me and the homies saw a Laker game for stupid cheap a couple weeks ago.
Lebron going back to Cleveland lol
if the jazz had better uniforms everyone would be rooting for them 😂
At least the Clippers and Nets and every other struggling team has had REASONS for sucking Lakers can’t even claim that really which makes it WORSE 😖😖😖
Cavs, Bucks and Celtics are the best teams so far
The Warriors are obviously still contenders, Curry is playing the best of his life, Divencenzo was hurt for the road stretch making Poole have to take that roll & they’ve shot miserably from 3 while racking up a ridiculous amount of fouls, shooting will balance out & the fouling will come down as the young guys stop getting stupid ones
New Orleans can fight for a playoff spot and STILL can land Wembanyama.
The warriors tanking for wemby is the too far fetched seeing they always struggled with having an undersized roster
WEMBY!!!
AD jab not necessary
so blessed to live in this era of basketball
How do you not mention the Kings? After an 0-4 start they are 5-2 with their only two losses in that period being a 3 point loss on the road to the Heat on a Tyler Herro travel no-call (with Fox out injured) and a 3 point loss to the Warriors on the road on a Klay Thompson 3 pointer foul no-call. They are about to go up against a full strength Warriors squad for the 3rd time tonight and for the first time it won't be on the road. Their only noncompetitive game the whole season has been a 15 point loss vs the Griz.  Fox better than any of the top 50 scorers in the league on FG% other than Jokic right now.  Once these players and this coach get some time together they are going to be damned good.
Bruh the Warriors are not a dumpster fire, no team is a dumpster fire when you got Steph Curry! Also stop overacting to the Warriors start lmfao its been 12 games and yall are saying we’re trying to take for Wembenyama, like wtf! Watch the Warriors will be the favorites to win the chip again come All star break
This is pretty unrelated, but Kobe's death is just so unfair, he was such an inspiration, took too early. RIP Kobe and Gigi
Time for LeBron to come home...again, I suppose :D.
Hope we see a Cavs Suns finals with way things are going
Just imagine the Jazz vs Cavs in the finals..
I hate that people don’t acknowledge the absolutely terrible job Nash did as a coach last szn. He literally ran no plays, his whole offense was give KD the ball.  y’all try to make it seem like he was a scapegoat no he was apart of the problem. Brooklyn made it to the playoffs only because of the play in and when Boston start double and triple teaming KD what was Nash’s plan? Keep giving KD the ball
I feel the disappointment to LA and GSW my man hahaha. But I believe GSW will bounce back. LA wont
Glad you guys finally figured out Kawhine is a faker like the Spurs HOFers tried to tell you years ago...
Imagine gsw locking in wembanyama 🤣
Steve Nash was a trash coach, though. It’d be funny if the Cavs become a dynasty post Lebron.
When Superstars go to Brooklyn, something bad happens.
Warriors will still win this season no matter what ranking they at.
Drafting Kawhi this year was a mistake
Luka MVP
Bucks 2022-2023 champions.
Wolves so irrelevant they don’t even get a mention lmao
Since firing Nash, the Nets are 4 - 1 sooooo.....
I love how unhinged JImmy's tone was in the video, was crazy fun! Nice change of pace, but given that the point of the video was to describe how wild this start has been to the season, the tone makes sense!
Rockets tanking pretty good 😅
@4:20 2 - 9 record indicates winning a 2 /11 winning ratio = .18 .18 * 82 = 14.76, round up to 15 games won in an 82 game season. Translates to a win loss record of 15 - 67, just sayin'
Orlando magic is making a comeback probably they will go to the playoffs for sure but that's just me
Go Blazers❤
That Cavs and Jazz trade has been a massive blessing for both teams.
All jokes aside, imagine if the Warriors really did get Victor lol
Kawhi is the unspoken Kyrie ahaha
Dude lauri marekenen is strait BALLING. He deserves all the credit he’s getting
Jimmy always find a way to jab at Ben Simmons in every video
I’m hoping the pistons grow with Cade in these next few years and go all the way.
Every video, Jimmy sounds more and more like CalebCity and I love it😂
Mike, could you make a video on why PER has been higher than ever before in NBA history,
Never change the song you use in your vids, it is iconic at this point
Everything is going great so far this season 📈 Except the Refs 😅 📉
banger video per usual
BTW, Shout out to my Atlanta Hawks; and the fantastic acquisition of Dejounte Murray 🥰🥰🥰
Hallelujah he uploaded
To be fair, the nets look like they are turning things around. Despite kyrie not playing, and Simmons not doing anything, they just went 4-5, playing great defense, and showing heart and grit. As a fan, I hope they manage to turn things around for real.
It’s still early in the season the jazz gonna drop to the 5 or 6th seed
Never felt like I had to say but looks like Jimmy just wanted to pay rent
That Warriors Cavs game was so poorly officiated that there needs to be an investigation
Warriors losing 6 games in a row just for Steph to continue the 11-game win streak against the Cavs is truly a joy to see.
If the Pistons somehow magically win the Victor sweepstakes im gonna get his face tatted on my body
I just feel good for Kevin Love man. Stuck with Cleveland and now he has a good chance to get a ring away from LeBron and kyrie to solidify he was the greatest Cav of all time. (Sarcasm but actually happy for Kevin Love)
Thers no way you Talk about the crazy start whizout mentioning LUKA
Im convinced the hornets called the cops on their own players to have a reason to tank conspicuously
Kawhi literally had goat potential he just doesn’t really like to play basketball
One wild thing in the NBA today is I've seen more carry callls in the last 3weeks than in the last 3 years. Jimmy really changing the game.
No talk about Luka?
Warriors will be back in the playoffs, have no doubts
Whenever Jimmy posts a video it makes my day
Video starts at 1:45
Y’all make this video every god damn year 🤦🏻‍♂️
Kawhi the real _street clothes_
The nets firing Nash will go down as one of the all time worst coach firings ever.
One of the few channels that gets a thumbs up before I watch the video
you know when you enjoy a vid so much, that it feels like a 2 min Video  Loved the work as always Jimmy
women should not be refs in basketball
Eastern conference finals Cavs v Bucks will be fun to watch if nothing else.
However you spin it, Nash had to go.
Steve Nash was a shit coach regardless of Kyrie, bro deserved to get fired
"Ben Simmons regressing into a poor mans Draymond Green" 🤣
Ayo Tonight is showtime Brooklyn bricks vs Los Angeles bricklayers kekw
Bucks may actually run it back to the finals. I can see it..
Imagine the pelicans with BI, Zion and Victor Wembenyama
Yooo, did I really win your giveaway and that's you thats talking to me on telegram?
As a Pacers fan, the idea of us not being in the Wemby sweepstakes is predicated on this young core taking a massive step forward, which I am 1000% ok with
It's so crazy that you didn't even mention the Celtics having the best offense of all time by a mile with a rookie head coach.
W video JXMY. You the man
Within an hour
I just started watching the NBA this season an my team is the Hornets. They're so bad that I want to kill myself already
This is the most energetic I’ve ever heard Jxmy in a video
I literally just DON'T UNDERSTAND the people who adores this trash of a player bron is. I understand all the accolades BUT for people to put him as #1 greatest to ever play are complete delusional lunatics. He ain't even at the peaks of the likes of Kareem, Duncan, Magic, Kobe, etc. This guy flops, travels, leaves early after losing terribly, doesn't shake opposing teams hands after losing, jumps ships to form super teams, claims himself goat, complains to the refs all the time and I can go on and on..... Even Jordan at the age of 40 with the Wizards without having a secondary star player let alone a couple 75th greatest players of all time to play with him is not as bad as the Lakers are right now.
Man you need to upload more often having me feeling like im going through withdrawl inbetween videos
No chart? Jxmy are you ok ?
8 MIN VID WIT A ADD YOUTUBERS ARE SO ANNOYING
bro i just started making videos last month and damn now do i have an appreciation for the elegance to your editing. keep killin it g
The Anthony grabbing his back joke made me cackle
ew blazers got a free dub from refs trash ew
Needed this video after that Bills loss
What about the Celtics 🤔
“The clippers suck be the cavs are amazing” -right after the cavs lose to the clippers
My Lakers are a sinking ship… and by sitting out so much, Kawhi is officially a damaged goods
you can hear all kinds of emotions from Jimmy in this video from disgust, surprise, sarcasm, the wtf, excitement, etc etc lol
that Kawhi fantasy rant got me dude 😂 I got a friend that feels the exact same way lol
Kobe Bryant is rolling in his grave right now with how bad the lakers are right now 😢
"I don't care, Go Blazers"  Jimmy's happiness is screaming through the mic, and I'm all here for it 😁
The wemby sweepstakes are fan made lmao😂 I don’t think any nba team sees victor as a “generational talent”. I mean bro is literally just kristaps porzingus
Thank you for not even mentioning Miami I don’t think I can take it anymore
Jxmmy always comes thru 💯
Bad take on the Nets, who are now rolling with JV. Guessing this video came together a week too early.
Could you imagine the warriors doing the same thing the Montreal Canadiens did in the NHL last year??!?   Go from the finals to the 1st overall pick after one season
Let’s go warriors, beat the best team
You forgot the mind bending idea of Westbrook running for the 6th man. Crazy year so far
What about the Suns. Damn whats up with the disrespect.
so you want teams tanking??? wtf is your issue?
Kawhi has a degenerative knee issue. Bro isn’t just sitting out cause he wants to smoke blunts and play 2k. Trust no one wants Kawhi to be back on the floor more than he does.
Yeah Blazers!!!! ❤🩶🖤
If the warriors somehow get Vic steph curry will retire with 10 rings
Funniest part about this season is the fact that the warriors are somehow almost as bad as the lakers 😂
Warriors just beat the "real deal" tho lol
And LeBron wants to be known as the GOAT? Michael Jordan could be playing with 4 kindergartners and he still wouldn’t let his team win as little as LeBron did last year and now what he’s preheated to have this Lakers team win this year.  Yes, LeBron is great, but he isn’t the GOAT! That’s for damn sure! I don’t care what the numbers say. It’s about HEART!!! He seems to have none!
Would love to get a break down of daddy Angies HISTORIC moves over the off-season and how the jazz are sitting at the top of the western conference with 0 all stars and 2 people remaining from their starting 5 :) give the jazz some love please😘. Love your stuff Jimmy!!!
Correction: the Warriors are the only DEFENDING CHAMPS to start 0-6 on the road… I believe you said they are the first team in nba history to start 0-6
7 players averaging over 30 ppg is the craziest thing I've ever seen
The climate crisis is important and urgent, more important than sports. La crisis climática es importante y urgente, mas importante que deportes
if the warriors finish in a good seed curry might win MVP, theyll get it together but curry will have to average 30 or more for title contention
I wasn’t suprised at all with the jazz being so good. Rudy gobert sucks and has always been extremely overrated. held that franchise back for so long by some how convincing them he’s an all star type player. Ntm the shit they got back for him they literally scammed the timberwolves 🤡 saw this coming from a mile away
Straight to the point huh??
That was too short
I dunno who looked at the Cavs roster and decided "8th in the east" because I'm a Hawks fan and from the instant of that trade I've been saying they're a top 4 east team with the Bucks obviously at 1 and the Hawks, Cavs, and Celtics tied at 2, 3, and 4
I get the Jazz being rated poorly, but the Blazers have a decent team, Lillard, Grant, Simons, that big man they have who was injured for like a year a couple years ago (blanking on the name), just those 4 are enough to get you a play in game or better.
the cavs are not the real deal. all smoke and mirrors powered by outlier 3 pt shooting by mitchell and levert (CARIS LEVERT!). they cannot possibly maintain that level and once they regress they'll end up bottom half of the playoffs.
As a Lakers fan… I’ll shut up
Bro is adamant about not talking about the twolves they've been a wierd story this year so far
Also Luka has been insane
No word of love for Boston?
Zion and Victor coming next season a la the Lakers?
No one said it was Steve Nash’s fault and no one said he was taking all the blame. The nets have a whole lot of problems and Steve Nash was also one of their problems. Out of all of them though, replacing a coach is the easiest to fix so that was dealt with first.
I have lost SO much money on "sure bets" that I'm convinced there's some kind of conspiracy.
It looks like Bucks, Celtics, Cavs fight for the east, cakewalk in the west.
It's a good day when jxmyhighroller posts
THE NBA IS TURNING INTO A REALITY SHOW RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES LMFAOOO
The jazz unclogged their offense
4:50 you can’t tell me Davis don’t want to be in a new team cause I feel like he’s faking it, and playing it off well
I've always loved Jxmy's videos and this one was no different, BUT, I was disappointed by the fact that Luka had the greatest scoring start for a season since Wilt, and he didn't talk about it. On another note, the Lakers look like a team that is tanking badly, without even being able to tank.  Anyways thx Jxmy, keep it up!
Not a word about Luka?
Blazers are gonna win the chip!
imagine not talking bout the raptors
Sixers also look like incandescent dumpster contents 😢
And as always...great video🤘
So pumped my Cavs made this. And the NBA truly has never been better
You know the nba is in a bad spot when jimmy can’t go one sentence without losing his breath 😂
When you poor man draymond green you know your doing bad
As A Blazer Fan I’m HYPED!!  Also GP2 Hasn’t Even Touched The Court Yet!
hopefully the warriors will be back    Edit: The warriors havent done anything
I can’t be the only one who enjoys watching lebron lose.
You and Chris smoove. Favourite YouTubers
Popovic got the best out of his dudes once again man he's so good
Way to not talk about the Celtics who has been killing it so far this season
as a hornets fan, i was excited for this season, but now im excited for victor wembenyama
when kobe died the lakers got jinxed i swear....
Nothing gets me more hype that seeing a highroller video at the top of my recommended💪🏻
Good video as usual
NBA is still a thing?  wow, who knew
As a pelicans fan I’m very excited at the possibility of making the playoffs and potentially landing victor!
Lebrons airball combined with the bench reactions at 5:00 is hilarious
Kawhi Leonard is the KoryxKenshin of the NBA 😂
Shit video, nice view grabber lmao dude basing this off of analytics and 3 weeks of the nba “warriors are a failure” keep the same energy
Those Laker highlights 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 what a mess🤦🏿
Drafting Kahwi in fantasy is like buying electronics at 5 Below.
This is truly the season that anyone can win the chip...there's no clear favorite right now
it’s so weird
bucks for another chip
Why do the Grizzlies never get mentioned
Anyone else notice how all the FIBA foreing players came into this season on fire and in shape
As a warriors fan this season has been rough, but as a basketball fan it’s definitely a lot more interesting than it has been the last 4-5 seasons
Man I just don’t know what’s going on anymore in the league
Jimmy I love you and your content but there's no way you actually think Nash was just a scapegoat for the Nets 😂😂😂 I get it if you're not watching Nets games but come on you can't be falling for NBA media narratives like this, you're better than that.
6:50  I think you had a little typo :)  10th in MoV Nuggets or Blazers?
Luka MVP
First ten games don't matter but we passed all that now. Let's get it cavs and jazz. I love both teams.
Better than ever is still not very good honestly 😢
now the nets are better lol. even crazier
We should be embarrassed for underestimating the Jazz. Sure they traded their stars, but they got back quality players and still had two very good guards untouched.  Danny Ainge managed to finesse the nets into trading away their future for aging stars and now he's traded two all stars to finesse the Wolves and do good by the Cavs.
Is this video before or after the Kings and Cleveland games that Steph dropped 40 on both?
I was waiting for a video like this Jxmy! This season start has somehow felt like the playoffs! Been incredible so far!
“my fantasy team is in the trenches” so relatable, khris middleton out, giannis dtd grayson allen dtd and kawhi out like bro PLEASE
The NBA sucks and is controlled by China.  Any support for the NBA is supporting oppression.  How woke
Idk what you are talking about Jimmy, Steve Nash was a clown show of a coach. The Nets made a huge mistake firing their last coach and hiring Nash.
Did GS get a new roster?
You said that last year. Next year you’ll say it again!
Nets are good now tho😭😭glad you took a break from the chart you needed one bro
No mention of the Celtics or Tatum because they're the only ones living to expectation this year lol
The Lakers should make this season about winning enough games to not allow the pelicans to have a top 5 pick
Lakers is fucked. i'm a fan and i'm done watching them
I have faith for Cleveland fs
“My fantasy team is in the trenches. DO SOMETHING” -JxmyHighroller 2022
Unprecedented amount of talent in the league. A single star or even a duo of stars is no longer enough to pull out W's. A well rounded, well coached and well-crafted locker room culture is essential and I'm all for it.
Sorry I just don’t find these videos interesting anymore. Time to unsubscribe.
This is the craziest start to the season
Bucks and cavs in ecf is my prediction
I have respect for injuries, especially if they can be career threatening, but how much bad money is chasing people that play half of the time or less ?    How can this be fixed ??  I don't know for sure, but this not only hurts the individual teams directly, but also ratings due to teams not knowing if people may bench themselves for rest...  I will certainly get some hate, but if a player misses 50 % of games in a season, maybe allowing teams to void a contract.  This is too harsh on people that are really hurt and trying to get back, but eating salary cap like Kawaii, Ben, etc. hurts the team and league eventually.  Just frustrated I guess.
What’s even more amazing about Warriors’ 0-6 record on the road is that they have 2016 Curry averaging 33 pts a game right now, yet the rest of the team that they spent so much cash on ain’t turning up at all lmao
Forgot about the drama with Ime and the Celtics....
It's sad that were getting carried away if we say the Lakers can make the play-in
Why your vid’s always so 🔥, I was watching a different video and clicked off right as I saw the upload
The only bad thing about jimmy’s videos is that their not long enough
When teams do bad, coaches get fired.  That’s nothing new
i like that the league actually has paridy now, something that hasnt happen since the 70s instead of just 2-4 teams dominating the league and being predictable. It's like Hockey
6:45 you got the Blazers with the 10th best margin of victory but the Nuggets logo lol
Keep sleeping on the Celtics bud
Ngl cavs, wizards Utah they are having a crazy start
yo this video quality is crazy!!! Keep it up
Go Blazers!
Donavon Mitchell is going through the stages of LeBron, be scared.
Jus' a little correction, on 6:50 in third coloumn blazers have denver logo on 10th place, other than that amazing video as always :)
cavs in 6
Damn Jimmy the thumbnail ain’t clean 😭😭
Oh my fucking God I love your videos.  Just put a smile on my face every time. Keep them coming🫡
Pro sports have too many regular season games. AND management AND their players are in on the laziness. Nobody gives a shit until it statistically matters.
Luka mid curry solos ong
I miss the trap sax
Also, when kawhi does play, he’s not anywhere close to his previous superstar status. Yea you could say it’s injuries, consistency or whatever you like, but as of rn, when he plays, he’s a negative.
I've been watching the NBA since the Magic and Bird days. There is so much skill in the league today, it's astonishing. It results in a lot of parity, where there aren't really any bad teams, just teams with injuries or teams with chemistry issues. Almost the entire league has has two or three guys on their roster that could take over on any given night. So I don't find it surprising that some teams are winning or losing more than expected after a few games. However I'd posit that this isn't necessarily indicative of how the rest of the season will go; it's a long season. But it's sure been fun to watch!
Literally one of your best videos bro haha. Keep killin it.
Aaaand nothing about Luka dominating...
Bro sounds fed up wit the warriors, lakers, and clippers 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 he’s had enough of this foolery
As a Blazers fan  i’m crying tears of joy, just seeing my favorite team function.
Lakers got 3 top 75 😂😂😂
Didn't the Lakers have the best young talent pool? Oh, I forgot they were all traded to please your GOAT (getting AD and other "superstars"). 🤣
Ok it wasn’t just me that thought this season is INSANE so far.
It’s early tooooo early 😂
Andre karilinko …. That one drake looking foo… deron Williams …. All these stars start with jazz and right before they get really good they trade away
You trolling for drafting Kawhi for fantasy 😂
Somehow Luka's historic start to the season isn't even on the list for this video😂
Pretty sure the entire world is over kawhi load management. Personally, I’d prefer if he just retired and stop wasting every bodies time and being a huge detriment to his team. Taking up one of the max spots without even playing. Can’t blame him, he’s getting paid. But from a basketball perspective, a fan perspective, just plz, retire.
Not to mention the shitshow that is the Timberwolves
Celtics?
If you think Steve Nash wasn't a terrible coach and the worst problem of the nets, you do not watch the Nets
These are some bold proclamations based off one month
Damnnnnnnnnnn, I cried when he said "let's not get carried away" 😭  what if they do tho....
Bruh, our western easter standing prediction all fkn wrong man 😅
"Anthony Davis clenching on his back everytime a defender looks at him the wrong way" -Jimmy Highroller 2K22 I AM DYING
All Warriors do is make the playoffs then turn up in the playoffs
And a prime Dirk Nowitzki 😆 I lost it 💀
bro you always got a NASTY beat in the background
jimmy is allergic to talking about luka and the mavs
Lakers can bounce back, just trust LeBron he'll trade everything other than him
the ONLY youtuber I press like before watching the video
I love kyrie
801 all day Utah respresent
Wake up, Hes posted 😮😮
I want to see a deep dive on the Jazz. how did they trade their franchise star, and an all star (who immediately started excelling at his next team) and STILL come out on top of their conference? thats incredible
what happened to trap sax
Better than ever??? Really??
GO CAVSSSSSSS
It’s not just the nba, look at the nfl, the  giants and jets are doing better than the bucs and packers
Your videos are always worth the sometimes long wait. Never disappointed all these years. Man you’re my favorite YouTuber
great video and as always I’m satisfied
gianis 2 mvps nicola 2 mvps yeah it’s great time to win another international mvp luca(or even markanen😂)
Rip Kobe
The greatest nba rivalry Ben Simmons vs the rim is getting heated this season
Steve Nash got fired because of his lack of good plays, horrible line ups, and not knowing when to call a timeout. Steve Nash was going to be fired one way or another. He is not the scape goat, don't let them change the narrative.
i love jxmy highroller his videos just never disappoint!
Utah supposed to tank on top of the west😂
Ben Simons regresing into poor mans Draymond Green has to be the funniest shit i've heard all day
LMFAO at 4:03! 😂😂😂
I'm not even sure if the lakers will win 16 games.
Never surprised at the absolute 0 mention of Toronto, you know the team who did beat Cleveland... smh. Casual.
6:47 soooo Jxmy, did you mean to line them up by skin tone or nah? 😂they really are balanced, look at that gradient
Defending Champ Dubs are 5-7, Curry being filthy clutch and on a win streak. Don't put them in the same sentence as the Lakers
Funniest Jxmy video i’ve ever watched 🤣
It was all Steve Nash's fault tho lol
I'm not blaming Nash for the dysfunction, but he was not a creative coach, he had two plays he ever ran and the rest was KD save me, Kyrie iso, getting rid of him was the start for a good change
I kneed a "JxmyHighroller" for NFL
I mean. I am Warriors fan. And still I am laughing so hard at the way you presented each team and their situations. The Warriors are not doing well, but I trust that they will get better. In the meantime, I'll keep enjoying you pull out the funniest youtube-legal roasts know to human history for each and every single team. Great video.  Also, the music is simply perfect for the occasion.
You can’t tell me Steve Nash wasn’t part of the problem for the nets 😂
Kawhi the greatest part timer of all time.
The disrespect to not talk abt the insane start SGA is having is insane
This man could tell me anything and I would devour it faster than Ben Simmons would pass up a chance to score
Good video, but will you pin this tho?
Warriors playing against refs and teams
Before injuries, last year Cavaliers could’ve gone to the playoffs so after getting an upgrade in Marshall I am not surprised by their standing.
Go Blazers.
mj the goat
i mean i get that kawhi does load manage a lot, but it’s disingenuous to not mention what type of knee injury he suffered years ago. it’s an ONGOING one, so even if he’s been cleared to play and suffers no more major injuries, it will still prohibit him and be reactivated constantly just by him playing. it’s okay to knock him down and put more available players ahead of him, but let’s not act like this is his choice to make at this point in time
The season has been interesting to say the least. I think from here on forward it will become pretty normal
The blazers are ALWAYS under rated. Every single year we hear "they won't even make the playoffs." Then, the blazers make the playoffs, every year. (Last year was an exception where dame FINALLY got a surgery he's been putting off for years) That said, no one expected the blazers to be this good. Blazers fans thought we'd be 6th seed at best. I am loving this season so far. Oh, also LMAO THE LAKERS SUCK AHHAHAHAHAHHAHHA. Man I love watching the lakers fail.
I swear i’ve been waiting for this it’s like the league been flipped upside down for no apparent reason
Bro this season is about to be the most eventful season in a while
As a portland native. I agree. I don't care. Let's go blazers!
I got to be honest, that was the fastest 8 minutes of my life. I was like.. Wait the video is already ending? 🤣
Always a banger 💯
I was only surprised by the warriors and the jazz. I always felt like the Cavs would be a top 5 team and maybe even the second best team. And the Nets.. I mean, I had lost hope over them a looong time ago, and that includes Ben
"Cavs projected to be 8th team in the league" while showing a board where they're 14th ^^
Jimmy, you forgot about the Boston Celtics, my Chicago Bulls, the Dallas Mavericks, and the Denver Nuggets.
Good video. Im suprised you didnt mention denver and their talent. Jamal back and Erin Gordon??
Boycott
SGA deserves more respect
Hi
Lakers in the finals 2030
I would love for the Jazz to just win it all
Steve Nash gets fired... the nets start winning 🤷🏾‍♂️
Warriors just beat cavs
FREE KYRIE
can we have one of these each month? a sub 10 minute recap would be the best s**t ever. pretty please🙏🏽
3 all time greats on the Lakers. Bitch where?
Being injured is not the same as just not suiting up for no reason.  Why is this still a narrative?
The Cowboys are favored to win the Super Bowl…. There’s something very wrong this season.
luka still yet to score a game under 30 points just adds to the insanity of whats happening rn
Ig Denver is also tanking for Wembanyama as well, wait they don’t even have there own pic
I think we are gonna see mavs and bucks gunning for a ring
Hahahah this is the funniest narration I’ve ever seen, he seems genuinely mad about some things in this video
Facts it is a wild start but Go Cavs, GSW, and Bulls 👏🏿
Can I get likes for no reason pls?
W
And i love it 😂🤪
the khris middleton fact had me dead 🤣
Same here
If Wembyana goes to the Pelicans they are going to be a legendary team.
League pass hitting different this year
Another great video from Jimmy 🎉
mid
Poor man's Draymond Green😂💀
I hope Bron don't have a "homecoming" next year 🤔
First
PREACH MY BOY!
2:59 - It's crazy to me that Kawhi missing time, everyone assumes he's faking an injury? He literally tore his ACL and is coming off that injury, the Spurs questioning Kawhi's injury back in 2018 has wrongfully damaged his reputation forever. When you get hurt, you know your body best, why would Kawhi fake an injury, it never made sense. The Spurs getting that much benefit of doubt was always ridiculous, especially given the way they've managed their organization the past few years.  5:41 - You just proved to me you don't watch Nets basketball. Anyone who's watched the Nets these past few years can tell you, Steve Nash was a horrific coach. He was hand selected by his former teammate Sean Marks to be the coach of this team, he was one of the worst coaches in the NBA. He never ran plays, his rotations were garbage, and he had no idea what he was doing. The fact that the Nets are actually winning games the instant he got fired is proof of that.
I clicked this faster than lebron losing and regaining his hairline
Soap opera
My dude got passionate on this one. Also my theory is the league somehow incentivized winning and told the small markets its open season. The reason for this being they want Wembanyama to fall to a big market team. I think they told the owners that the basketball Gods would make sure small market teams win the next few finals
Markkanen should also be in the run for MVP
Jimmy was on one in this video bruh 🤣
NBA is so fun right now. So many interesting teams
babe wake up, jxmyhighroller posted
Warriors will be back on top.
my mom just made dinner perfect timing
Literally Goat basketball youtuber
Kyrie, the Nets and Lakers are the gifts that keep on giving! We really shouldn't be surprised any more but we still are, for some reason.
Can’t wait to see clique react to this
This man d rides lebron every video
Yo jimmy why .. u talking about my team so bad bruh 🤣😂 but we deserve it
Crazy how much can change so fast in the NBA. Without Nash and Kyrie the Nets have actually been playing well. Steph went off and the Warriors beat the Cavs. And the Lakers are getting things fine tuned to bring Wembanyama to New Orleans.
Are we going to ignore the wizards being called the worst team in the whole NBA and being the 5th seed in the east? Honestly, they deserve more respect.
Surely the Warriors aren't the first team in NBA history to start off 0- 6 on the road.
Free kyrie
Bro at 6:51 the players are aligned in a gradient from black to white 💀
I’m not too worried about the golden skin warriors, last season the Celtics had one of the greatest mid season turn arounds ever - so it’s definitely possible
ADAM SILVER RUINED THE NBA!
The Nets alone could’ve had this video 😂
All i wish is for giannis to win another ring this season
The Warriors will eventually figure things out and be in the top seed once again, as long as Steph plays great and average 30+ ppg lol.
Season felt different from the start
Prime Dirk 😂😂
There is tanking. It's just not from the teams you thought. Imagine the warriors stinking for another year just to land SlickVic and threepeat.
I can't tell you how satisfying it is to be Jazz fan and see them shut all the haters down
so we just gonna ignore luka droppin 30 ten games in a row? oh right. its luka why should we be suprised
We will see after tonight but the kings look like they are pulling something together
Always high quality videos on JxmyHighroller.
JXMY says, "The NBA is back... and it's better than ever." You forgot, "...except for the refs."
Idk what Jimmy ate this morning but wow I love this new Jimmy’s humor
I’m here before a 100k views, a win is a win.
Imagine a Cavs vs Jazz finals
Imagine victor zion bi and cj on the same teammm🔥🔥🔥
I don't even watch basketball ball but love these videos, good shit for sure.
Kawhi Leonard is the Julian Edelman in the NBA, he does absolutely shit in the regular season, but come post season he’ll do his thing
This year any team can make it to the playoffs
You have progressed into one of the greatest content creators of all time.
Markkanen🔥🔥🔥
NBA is trash.
Not sure when you put this video together, but you probably should have updated before posting. The Brooklyn Nets are absolutely BALLIN right now, and the only thing that changed was Steve Nash.
GOOD ONE
Weekly content from this man gets me through work 🤣 3 weeks in who’s winning it all this year?
This is still my favorite YT channel 💯
Best nba youtuber. You have been for years
another nba season ,another jxmy's videos season ! i don't know what i love most
The 🤴🏾 shall rise again.
Why does this man have a sponsor in every video
Seat Geek might as well just sponsor Jimmy's whole entire channel
I have Kawhi on Fantasy and I haven’t been able to use him at all
Love your vids bro
Classic nba overreaction, I get you gotta make ur vid tho
Can anybody tell me the first song used? (Not the sad one.)  Also, I'm pretty sure the Pelicans' top-8 (CJ-Herb-BI-Zion-JV-Nance-Jose-Murphy) could go toe-to-toe with Cleveland's. They just don't know how to win in overtime yet.
thanks for helping make sense of this madness
Anyone noticed Lauri Markkanen. He’s been phenomenal.  👇🏾
bro clearly hasnt watched nets after nash was fired. best defensive team since btw
Lauri Markkanen TAKEOVER😈‼️
"LOOSE" got me dying
nice intro, the ja clip hanging on the hoop was from last szn                                HI
No mention of the Grizzlies starting the season without 3 of their top 6 players and snatching that 2 seed in the west I see :/ is ok we never talked about until we're too loud to ignore I'll tune back around January when we got the number 1 seed locked in
This season is really turning out like a MyLeague simulation with the Jazz being a top team and the Warriors being garbage and you got Luka averaging almost a 35 point triple double…
it’s tyme for tha new generation, players that dominated tha 2010s are done for
jimmy why are so aggressive just accept the new reality    kawhi leonard is a modern day bill walton
i mean the nets have the number 1 ranked defense since they fired nash 🥱 they are looking pretty good
picked up lauri markkanen on my fantasy just before the season started and he’s been one of my best players so far 😭
Haha what a failure the Jazz are, they're failing as much as the Laker or the Worriors, going exactely the opposite of their season goals. Targeting that number 1 spot when it should be a transition  season into rebuilding. Big L from me.
Doesnt matter how you start, its how you finish. Its same with games..you think you won even a 20 point game...Lol
Fast forward to one year and JimmyX is gonna be making a video on how the domino effect led the pelicans to get Wembenyama 😂
Warriors lowkey going for Victor
Back in the day these old Superstars would retire, nowadays they just hang on to that government cheese
Hot Take: The Jazz will not make the playoffs after they start to fall off midseason (Let's see how well this ages)
A bench that resembles your least favorite G-league team 😂
I have been waiting not so Patiently and I’m so glad you uploaded
I wish people would talk about the Pacers more... such a fun young team to watch every night win or lose.
Jimmy Upload, best time of the day
The Bucks winning streak, Luka being insane, and the Jazz proving everyone wrong. What a start I’d say
As a bucks fan tho, we need to get giannis and jrue back in, there is no way in hell the celtics should be this close to us in the standings
so we arent going to talk about what luka doncic is doing rn???????
as a die hard, life long laker fan I just sit here and smile.  thats what you get stupid lakers.  i was telling everyone i knew we shouldnt trade our young guys(lonzo, ingram etc) and we shouldnt get lebron because i knew if we just kept that core together it would pay off in the long run. it was also something i have never seen the lakers do (build from draft picks) and it was exciting.  sure, you can say we wouldnt have won that ring in 2020 but i would trade that ring in to have those young boys who are all STUDS now. man its frustrating when your right and no-one listens lol
What is kris big head Middleton gonna do against the Celtics or cavs lol. Stop it
last szn the celtics were dogshit until january and caught fire, making it to the finals.
to be fair in the warrior's case, it's just not their bench that's holding them back, it seems like the REFs have made it their personal mission to make sure the team loses every game
i consistently find myself waiting for Jxmmy to drop another video and he never fails 😂 as a Warriors fan i cant wait til we get better so i can say " who's playing like dumpster fire now huh"??
Why does Jxmy keep talking so extra? Like at 4:06. It's cringe. His content is amazing enough, he doesn't need to be doing all that lmao. Just my thoughts.
Using your promo code to go see a grizz game next week so next time you buying lunch remember this comment lol love you jxmy
Agree with me or not but Jordan Poole is the problem
Lakers could make the playoffs 😂😂
Bol Bol for MIP
Hello
Imagine the warriors getting wemby tho
Always a great day when Jimmy uploads
Dawg I FEEL YOU on that kawhi fantasy struggle
its a good day when jxmy uploads.
@3:24 oh God you're a Baltimore nigga? 🤣
Just wait till Kyrie comes back !!!!
LoL
its not kawhi choosing not to play its the team do your research before you spread false information
Jazz will cool down but it’s great that they are able to stay competitive while they just traded their best 2 players on last years roster.
“CLEVELANDDDDD!!””
The start of this season has been so chaotic bro. Most exciting start I’ve seen since my 2019 raptors going up aga8nst the bucks in that 8th game. This gonna be a banger of a season
I’m curious if the league is purposely having the refs against the warriors bc of the money they spending.  Don’t get me wrong, there defense was a trash and they foul, but there’s been multiple games where the other team shot 2x more fts, and the game against the Cavs was crazy one sided
When Jxmy drops it's like a Drake drop, gotta stop everything else & tune in
“The lakers can even make the playoffs!… well let’s not get carried away here” 💀💀
lebron: imma be taking my talents back to cleveland

Jimmy for best nba YouTuber 💯💯
I was the first person to like the video
It’s a good day when the man uploads
Steph Curry and Luka are having the most insane starts to a season, they are the definite Mvps so far!
NEW JXMY 🗣️🗣️🗣️
If the warriors get Wembanyama by way of a bad season...  🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
MARKKANEN FOR MVP!! LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!
This is cool and all but I can’t be the only one watching the bills Vikings game rn
'My fantasy team is in the trenches' bruh I'm feeling you, ain't nobody want Kawhi right now 😭
Jxmy come in clutch when i’m eating man shiii
The Laker ineptitude > The Nets dysfunctional nature.   The Nets have been dysfunctional since Day 1. The Lakers were supposed to be better.
👍 before I watched it.
The Nets are in turmoil and I don’t see them getting out of it anytime soon. Meanwhile the Lakers are……………….. well the lakers.
i’m so early
Westbrook going for the MVP....of Shaqtin'
havent seen anyone really compliment the cavs on their rebuild after lebron left for the 2nd time
Your my favorite youtuber your videos are always edited to perfection
As a pacer fan I was prepared for a full tank mode but now I'm like screw it go all out.
U have to make video of markkanen as a fin i am saying what every fin would love to see from u🙏
I love how Jimmy's so done with Lakers lmao
perfect timing lets goo
Another W as always jimmy
why are you trying to talk like stephen a smith now? you're not funny lil bro
The season just started and my expectations for half the league were completely off. Crazy season
its always a good day if jimmy uploads
My man Jxmy got more stats than Tom Brady...
4:01 had me dead
Lakers in playoffs?  Nah....
rlly didnt talk abt lukas 9 game 30+ point streak
Babe wake up, Jimmy posted!
Thanks Jxmyhighroller.. love,love,love..mwah♥️
Kinda was Steve Nash’s fault…. no team has scored 100+ on them since Vaughn been coaching
Crazy but The changing of the guard is often ugly
There could honestly be a whole podcast on the mayhem that this NBA Season has produced
"Lets not get carried away" Okay jimmy, Like we were actually going to be 🤣
“What are you guys doing??? LOSE!!! -Jxmy
Who knows the Lakers might even make the playoffs - well lets not get carried away😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
LeBron sucks
W vid jxmy
“The Lakers could even make the money playoffs but let’s not get ahead of ourselves”jimmy 2022
you’ve gotta put the sponsor thing at the very end or the very start, you lock us in with the intro and then all that work gets destroyed by the sponsored ad
With the nets I would say kyrie media attention has been completely over blown
NOTI GAN G!
babe wake up, jxmy just dropped
Lakers will start winning today, with Schroder back on the court!
how do you even do all this? How many stats do you checkkkk???
The qaulity of these vids
Bro you're content is too good, u should make 20+ min videos
Suns keep winning 🙏🔥🔥
Thanks 🙏
yooooooooooooooooo
Was about to go to sleep but this is more important
Always a good day when this guy uploads
Fire as always 🔥
Lol man, you really sounded fired up this time :D
Man I continue to lick my chops when I hear the Lakers losing so many games. Not only because I’m a Raptors fan and love to see LeBron suffer and that it could lead to the Pelicans have a starting five of CJ McCollum, Brandon Ingram, Victor Wembenyama, Zion Williamson and Jonas Valanciunas. If they manage to snag Victor they will be a juggernaut.
We were actually seen as top 3 in the East before the season??? 💀  Not even top 3, but *top 5 in the NBA? With the many flaws we have?* That is hilarious 😂
Poor Steve Nash
hey anyone know the name of the song at the start?
Man Jimmy never disappoints 🔥
Damn, Jimmy coming in hot with all the emotion. Loving it!
Blazers ballin I love it
Felt like last year when everything went wrong
Please someone tell me the intro song in the first 6 seconds of the video #
W vid bro
New era same clippers 🥺 I just want to witness at least ONE finals appearance.
not better then ever
Bro got 5k plus views in Five minutes.. Legendary.
It’s hilarious when you make the stressed voice lmao.
imagine lakers getting no.1 overall pick in nba draft next year     AND DONT DRAFT VICTOR WEMBENYAMA
This was the most cohesive, analytical, and sport-enriching video I have watched in a long long time. Thank you Jimmy for your review on the craziest start to an nba season I have ever seen in my life aswell (Only been watching since 2015) Thank you for always uploading so frequently, and making our days better!
Absolute HOT dog water!🤣
Lmao Jimmy getting real emotional in this one "suit up my guy, my fantasy team is in the trenches" at 3:25.  And "this rotten bunch that call themselves the LA lakers"  4:05
Yooooooooooooooooooooooooo new vid❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The goat JIMMY 🐐
Bro we've been waiting every time he uploads is a great day
I think you should mention how well the pacers rookie is playing. Bennedict has been balling. Like could be a legit star.
Every JxmmyHighRoller video is a great video
NBA better than ever is a huge stretch
Early
Has Jimmy ever made a bad video?
lakers are so bad that they dont even show the games in the gym no more
I am early less go
I love how jimmy is just straight up roasting these teams
What is the name of the beat at the beginning?
“Do something Kawhi my fantasy team is in trenches” 💀
yes sirrr
we always appreciate a jimmy upload
Utah is playing insane, hopefully they can keep it up!
Oh yeah!!
5:10 atleast the Nets have looked a  bit better. The Lakers still just are so awful.   Your production value continues to inspire smaller creators like me. Keep grinding Jimmy.
Love seeing Jimmy support the Blazers ❤🖤
Utah Jazz took one long at Scoot and Victor and said "We gonna win a chip instead."
A short jimmy video. W
you know your day is weird when jxmyhigheroller  doesnt have a graph
Rip normal sports seasons it feels like every season is more and more crazy
No one expects the Utah Jazz to start this good fair play to them
Utah jazz more surprising then the (insert joke)
Thank You Jimmy for the upload🙏
Ah yes a jimy upload
I never want to skip the seatgeek add by Jxmy cause I know I’m just reducing the time I can hear his voice 😅
Common Jimmy W
the best nba channel, hands down.
I'm always feenin for more of this content
Jimmy making my day better when he posts
I feel like Jimmy says this is the craziest start to a season at the start of every season at this point. The NBA just keeps getting crazier every year!
warriors repeating if we fix our defence
W vid love the content
Every jimmy vid is a classic
De Goat
Utah went from being a legit contender for Wembanyama to being just a legit contender.
content has really gone down hill. Dude just uploads whenever he has a sponsor and not a good idea for a video these days. Kinda lame used to be my favorite basketball channel.
Worst part is Kyrie might retire
It will be a joy to watch LeBron and the Lakers make history all season.
I clicked this faster than Westbrook pulling up for a contested middy
Regards from Kenya 🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
Bro someone please sign this dude to ESPN
🗣️ JIMMY!!!!!!!!!!
I would love to see a Bucks vs Warriors finals this year
