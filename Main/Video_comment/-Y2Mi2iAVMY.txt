You don't mess with Red's pig.
I've not seen anyone else mention this, but OMG poor purple. Can you imagine inviting your friends to hang out with you, and they seem like they're gonna come, but then when you turn your back, they ALL just DIP. Don't even tell you anything or leave a note. Wow.

Red holding a sword look like a sword fish lol
7:40 my forvite
This is my favorite episode because of how creative alan was with different creatures and blocks in combat would be.
The pig's fur is so strong, I'm scared of keeping a pig as a pet😭😭
really expands on the potions
The addiction to nether warts
Sugarcane ✖️ Fighter sugarcane ✔️
11:15 Im just gonna say that the fact that Alan added a custom effect called "technopower" is awesome.
5:47
KEEP UP THE AMAZING WORK, MR. BECKER!
THE BLOCKS AND ANIMALS FIGHTING BACK WAS PERFECTION. LOVE ITTTTT
11:40 super head but
11:16 TechnoPower❤
TechnoPower❤
I really like Marvel. Most of its films. But now when we have Doctor Strange: multiverse of madness (it is not technically now but the movie is younger than this video) I have to say, that this video really feels to me like the better multiverse of madness 😂
Me di cuenta de que ví una planta de luciérnagas pero en esa versión era desde cuatro años como es posible?
2025 here
11:38 true form line "TECNHOBLADE NEVER DIES!"
07:58 this like roblox
🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🔮🔮🔮🪄🪄🪄
People see in the potion there's a invisibility
What happened to the bg music?!
In the immortal words of a children's movie about a pig, "that'll do pig". Epic fight choreograph!
its the technopower that carried bro
10:38 chest fell
Big is goat
This Is still peak.
11:40 technoblade punch void
100% of the pigs power came from all the potions  90% of the power came from Techno Power  *CHANGE MY MIND*
pure cinema, have watched many of ur vids, this is pure talent, you gained a sub🫡
Goku pig
11:20 technoblade is back 😅
tecnoblade never dies 11:29
11:35 я что аниме смотрю?!
😊мда свинья как всегда спасает всех, только вот короны не хватает😢
This episode really reminded me of mrfudgemonkeyz' annoying villagers series for some reason... Maybe its cuz of yellow's movements as a llama
Does anyone see that the pig has a affect called "Gotta Go Fast" and an effect called "Techno Power"? Go too 11:15 and pause and you'll find it
11:15 techno power😢
this actually teaches us to be more careful with the people you trust, they might betray you
The pig used death countered one punch man 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sticks vs. Sordom Only Arabs will understand it.
11:14   2 slow falling and 1 invisibility 💀
never thought in my life that i’d see a witch with a diamond sword battle a sugarcane block. And neither did i think it would be the coolest thing i’ve ever seen
The pig is technoblade because eof the effects "Techno power"
P.O.S for pig on steroids
Not even close, baby Technoblade never dies. He just teleported into the past into an Alan Becker video of.
11:35 switching to the direct hit because of a pyro on the enemy team without realising the pyro is top scoring
did anyone notice when pig drink potion it has techno power
plothole, how did the witch know to mimic orange? did the witch meet them before?
People say tsc or tco or tel is the strongest…. But none of them even combined can face PIG ON DRUGS
1.5 minutes after my domain I am invicble
11:15 where the pig fight begins
why the salmon so good at fighting?😂😂😂
4:54 What in the Kung-fu Panda!?
the pig got ready for round 2
UP
7:08
7;08
the way they jump around when theyve been reduced to dye is so funny
I remember this like yesterday
orange getting more and more belwildered as yellow makes the whateverthehellthatisinator is just gold
Bro i read this as animation vs witchcraft lol
How do a fish and some sugar canes fight SO WELL??
Whenever, a pig drinks too many potions they become Technoblade
11:18  P. I. G.
Kung fu pig
ТОРМОЗ
I liked the reference on the note blocks with green, I think orange knows that song a bit too well
Ok, I'm just now realizing the Witch in Minecraft is a woman
I swear to God, Pig has to be the strongest in the group.
11:15 did anyone see techno power
DAAAAAANNNNNNNNG!!!!!! 11:24
Squiston😂 8:52
I'm not convinced that witch is dead. Or that cannibal bunny. Or the Spider Monarch. Or whoever leads the zombie piglins. The Stickmen  have a rogues gallery that could team up and come back.
Alan Beckers Amination Good So Fire Super Fire The Animation Master
i love this video cause it has nice battle
rewatching all of these in a binge right now and I forgot how delightful this fight scene is. get fish slapped.
I love how if the pig gets a potion it becomes into a god.
9:26 mistake: Green was the cobblestone but the whitch was grabbing another block but then it turned to green
We named the pig Kevin in the live chat.
every character epecially between sugar cane green the witch big and blue looked like they were gonna be the next spinjutsu master but then the pig came in clutch
13:41 what this means?
Esta es la segunda vez qu los salva el cerdo😂😂
lol 11:14
The way Purple and the other stick figures greeted each other at the end is exactly how I greet my friends irl
11:15 TechnoPower and Gotta go fast 😂😂😂
13:42 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
11:14 "Pig has got the challenge *How Did We Get Here*"
11:13 POV of the pig: I am no god, for god would have mercy on you
Anyone from 2025❤
10:38 witch: (breaks the chest)
Techno power is an tribute before it happened
sigma red

I never thought ever that i would witness a lama , fish and a stuckman fighting a zombie but here we are.
11:16 techno power?😂😂😂
No way green got turned into sugar cane
The difference between beatdown and fight: Beatdown - 11:19 Fight: 9:45 - 11:17
I thought blue was an alley because alleys are blue
0:34 Blue is fake
11:13 Wow the super pig is back 😱😱😱

Guys I can see the sonic coin
9:27 aw so cute
The pig that sacrificed himself resembles techno blade
Kung fu pig 😂
and that pig with lots of potions came back
Descanza en paz azul y verde 😭🙏  Yo se que va hacer morado.
Ep 4: Everyone vs Pig Ep 19: Pig vs Everyone Ep 21: Everyone AND Pig vs Villian (they are allies)  Their relationship changes every now and then, lol (If there are any spelling or grammar errors, please point them out)
UNLIMITED PIGGY PUNCH!!!
Bro that might be the Minecraft legend not an ordinary pig
The fact that all the characters are basically like Clownpierce reincarnated
My favorite part about these little guys is that, without fail, they are ALWAYS down to fight. Doesn't matter what it is. Witch? Let's go. We're blocks?? We'll make it work.
9:52 the pig isn't in the cage anymore
The pig literally said "for the next 3 minutes I will be the strongest"
The pig beat the witch like it didn’t care
Cute pig
That pig went ultra instinct
W pig
Props to Red for having the worst luck of being a *fish* but still being capable in a fight.
11:15 techno power effect ? how did he got this !
8:46 No wonder why the swamp lakes are muckey
3:24 I thought the lama/yellow was sniffing him
Am I tripping? Where’s the music?
supercharged pig 2.0
bamboo>normal zombie in this episode's logic
If i was anyone of the gang i woulda said to the pig "thank you god"
Pig went ham on that witch 🤣
Pig hero
O porco é o heroiiii
Green makes better songs than Mojang with his Mojang blocks lol
Bro no one is talking about how everyone is still able to move precisely when in their block forms especially Green 😂😂😂😂😂😂💚💚
11:09 SUPER PORK 😮
every animal red spawns from spawn eggs JUST HAVE UNDYING LOYALTY TO HIM
alan becker did u ever think you’d draw a piston making potions
EL CERDO 3000!!!1
Asi es la pelea de roblox y Minecraft que es infinito no te acaba nunca o esto creemos
11:13 THE TITAN OF THE PIG
Getting beat up by a pig is crazy
Did anyone noitce that when the pig got potion affects, there's an effect that says "gatta go fast"?
Yellow : llama  Red : salmon  Green : sugar cane  Blue : piston  And orange is gonna save them after the pig helped him find them because of his sense of smell
➖🔵   🟦🟦🟦  🟦 🟦 🟦         🟦       🟦🟦      🟦    🟦
❤😂😂❤🎉🎉
W for making ''Techno Power'' a thing 11:15
( 11:13 ) Kung fu pig.
We can clearly known that the fish was Red because he was excited to see his pig, and the pig was so happy to found his friend, Red really love animals! And the animals love him too!
New game thats not my fighter
11:38 PLUS ULTRA!!!!!
What animation software do you use?
Pig went super "hamyan"
I think the techno power caried in the witch fight😂
This was insane🤯
when i saw that they transformed into blocks, i immediately started watching transformers
13:43  the way they mover their arms is so cute 😭
Cool
the pig power 11:14
11:17 Technoblade using only the 0.01% of his power o7 for the King 🐷👑
Let’s name the pig “KJ” with that punch he just did😂😂🎉🎉
Imagine if witchs could pull of moves like that in the game oh i would uninstall the game😂  And also pollution much 8:47
Am I the only one thinking about how the witch knew TSC and others even though they have not met before or why was she after them.
Nobody is talking about the fact that in 4:37 the zombie didnt burn, i mean, is obviously that the witch was the zombie but TSC, yellow and red didnt knew that was the witch, it was very obvious
Man, Orange need a break 😅
I was just reading all the potion effects till i saw one of them is named "Techo Power" and was wondering why, then i realize, theres only one person i know who has techno in their name and who has a pig skin as well. TECHNOBLADE!!! :)
A literal grass block throwing hands is so ridiculous 😂
THE SOUND AFFECTS ARE CLEAN😮
When You have the opportunity TO be a God for 3 mins and Ur biggest enemy is there:
4:10 WHAT IS DOING THE PORK????
The pig is the main character
11:14 TECHNO POWER!!!
11:16 it’s always so funny how powerful the pig becomes 😂😂
why has the almighty pig shown up twice now
just the pig turning into goku
11:12 techno blade never dies
Me when youtuber say smash that like button 11:38
The pig is the strongest with positions like first the gang and now the witch what's next ENTITY 303
3:14 hawk tuah
that pig has became god one too many times.
Amei ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊
The pig has a levitation effect but it not levitation😂
Andai disini mereka abis lawan penyihir ga ngikutin si ungu, pasti alurnya ga gitu🗿
Kung-Fu Plant-a 7:40
The Pig got Techno's soul

Poor blue
5:48 ここ好き
11:38 this a reference on the all might, its so cool bro
Nah bro got the “How did we get here” badge before I could💀
13:39 I guess its a stickman thing
7:03
Remember, the pig in the original potions short died. This is a different pig. That means this happens to _every_ pig hopped up on a cocktail of potions
Seeing a new old Techno mention made me emotional, thank you.
so many times in this episode, Red was away from death just by second. First is when fighting with the Zombie Witch when he was a fish, if Orange didnt throw that bucket then he could've sliced in half. Second is when fighting with the Witch in the final battle, he was turned into TNT and if Blue didnt save him in time, he could've blew up to death.
cook fish stickman
Syftw😂😂
😅hfh
i know who's the pig  it's tecnoblade
YO I LOVED THAT PART, THATS WHY MY FAVORITE EPISODE IS 21, but I liked the witch vs sugarcane more.
11:34 goo Edgar gooo
I love how in the end they all matched the same energy
The pig needs its own anime
So that’s how pistons work? That’s messed up
11:15 TECHNO POWER
😂 10:56 11:00 11:02
Hey bacon saved you guys
11:38 pig really had to say JUDGEMENT for that punch

Close enough, welcome back Technoblade
11:26 I love how the pig was torturing the witch
Techno power💀
I like how it says "Invisibility" but he isn't invisible
The pig converted into super pig😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
7:48 I can only imagine the pain of bamboo right here
5:00 fish be comboing 💀
8:12 bro disappeared
the pig is a ninja
The fighting scene is so fire🔥🔥🔥
If she’d used lingering sc would be dead
When bro locks in: 11:11
Pig is a hero❤
When the entire team is losing but bro pulls the most jaw-dropping 5v1 (this wont happen again for another 4 months)
Leave it to Alan Becker to be able to animate bamboo fighting and for it to be good
Make it so that tecnoblade gets revived  as the pig
11:39  TECHNO PUNCH😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
11:28 looks like something in a combo in mortal combat if you know what I mean
OH MY GOD!!!
The fact that invisibility has no effect
11:13 TECHOPOWER!!!
Alan and smash bros combine
11:24 Pig used Omni Directional Punch, then a wall combo, then Jet Dive, AND THEN DEATH COUNTER 💀

Plot twist the potion effect timer started going in the negatives
8:53 Ю O Ю O Ю O Ю O Ю O Ю O 8:04 9:32 모 8:46 머 ㅁ 머
11:43 ding!
The part your probally looking for 11:10
11:18  Bro: if you beat this pig you get 100$. Trust me its just a pig! The pig bro was talking about:
I only came here because i remembered of the meme "if you kill my pig i give you 100$"
hey bro can you tell me the power and the speed of the pig in numbers i want it faster as much as you can
SUPER PIG IS BACK🤣🤣
The origin of techno blade 11:09
The fact that they all stand in a rainbow 10:01
"Gotta go fast" That's wild 💀 "Techno power" Dam! 💀
Imagine if they were fighting to a beat that would be soooo coool, great animation though.
Shhhssss bro got humbled by pig
Why dose the pig and thw witch fight is so funny she is getting wrecked my a pig
The next episode is gonna be parkour
Ok so, if anyone is confused on why they're so friendly with purple even after all he did in the previous episodes, it's because on the "animation vs. legue of legendes" video purple is appears, and he becomes friends with all the group at the end, and so they become friends. (tbh i totally forgot abt that episode, and had no idea that that ep affected the main group's story lmao)
U just wanna see the technoblade do his special drugs technique
Only Alan Becker could manage to animate sugar cane and a fish throwing mad hands lol
7:16 its so goofy when green sugar cane walks 😂
Pig has completed the challenge [A furious cocktail]! Pig has completed the challenge [How did we get here?]!
bro am i the only one who gets confused at the end of this episode? I'm rewatching, and like WHY THE HECK did they go back with purple?? he was evil, he left blue and green to die in the void, if it wasn't for orange yellow and red THEY WOULD'VE BEEN DEAD didnt they get mad at purple for that??? like whatt?!! i always wonder if i miss somethimg bcs in my head it doesnt make sense
12:50 i love how he is a very good fighter (cuz he often wins when they all fight eachother) so he protects them all and acts like a big brother to them loll
Kill the pig and I will give you one million dollars also bros pig 11:11
Summary for people with a attention span of a goldfish: evil woman i think kidnaps people and makes them into items or animals or even blocks and blu finds a way to drink beer while being a piston and somehow becomes          normal again and but the 5 stickman fail but piggy has been drinking beer potions for so long he is overpowered and destroys evil woman (and also makes him purple die) and the stickmans is normal now
11:03 Connection terminated.
11:35  PIG FOR ALL
11:13
Techno blade took over the pig for 3 mins
10:56 Blue really be hitting the Pog face
11:05 technoblade appereances
orange senses are prety good
Orange has TRAUMA, methinks.
‏‪13:44‬‏ I love when they do this😂😂it's so cute and funny
11:16 Things I noticed: -Instant Health, Haste 2, Slow Falling, and Water Breathing are listed twice -Speed 2, Luck 2, Jump Boost 2, Night Vision 2, and Resistance 2 are also listed twice, but with different icons -Fire Resistance 2 & Absorption 2 are not listed once, not twice, but THREE TIMES. Twice with the same icon, once with a different one -Techno Power. -Gotta Go Fast I might have missed some, especially since there are a few behind the pig, but I just wanted to throw this out there because I'm a sucker for details and pointless trivia. I know others have pointed out the reference effects but I wanted to lump them in with the duplicates bc why not
GOTTA GO FAST
who watch in 2024？
only alan becjer can make salmon cool
11:38 HOME RUN
78 MILLION VIEWS truly techno would be proud
The witch is the most evil villain because she threw all her empty glass bottles into the water; hopefully Blue can clean up her mess with his magic TeamSeas powers.

THE PIG SIGMA 🗿
TECHNO POWER
This entire episode is genius. Alan took everything we knew about the characters minecraft wise and made them recognizable purely based on what they're good at.  Yellow with Redstone Red with Husbandry Green with Music (He even knew what specific song to play to be instantly recognizable to his friends).  Not to mention the fight scenes are amazing in pure Alan Becker fashion.

11:14 'Techno Power" LMAOOO
Blue's fate was easily the most horrifying thing I've ever seen. Forced to harvest Netherwart for eternity, and yet forever unable to actually obtain it.
3:49 😂😂
yes
I'm in your room
13:40  what were they even doing 😂😊 so cute 😍
Bro defeated all the sticks but got destroyed by a pig💀
Everyone praising green and red but u think a llama is that good enough?
We should appreciate the pig for rubbing his chin to the ground for all of this....
Who would win?   A witch who has been honing her craft for presumably years, and was single handedly able to 1v5 the maint cast and win  OR  One oinky boy (on drugs)
11:12  super pig he/she is back!!!
Its funny that the stickmans run as a block that makes me dying laugh even more😂😂😂
11:12 bro got the”how did we get here?” Achievement 💀 If you live under a rock, and don’t know what it is, it’s when you get all effects on your character at once.
1:40 if the witch had any sense at all it would have made lingering potions
Tthe pig in rempage mode whe drink the posien
Wait Is this just Journey to the West
I noticed this in the background.. TECHNO POWER?
Ah yes the return of steroid pig

Potion master vs potion master
So weren’t they on kinda bad terms with purple after they left his village? I mean they did kinda ruin his life
This will be the next update. Witches will have weapons and potions😮😮😅
This is a cuphead boss fight
The pig brought the power of his ancestors from episode four
11:15 for the effects
Did purple even meet TSC, When they saw purple, They hugged TSC and Green, but I swear that purple never met TSC, and only blue and green. I’ve only watched animation vs Minecraft shorts so far, so there might be some lore I missed.
12:14 Purple: Orange! Green! Other guys!
The pig turned into saitama
The rapid swap to different objects and creatures and the accuracy is astonishing, it's so do good everytime I see it
Saitama pig
Tecnobilede mod:on

Pig stronger than saitama lol
LA BRUJA DEL 71 tenia que ser entonces todo este tiempo a estado engañando al chavo y los demas SI ERA UNA BRUJA
This. Is. Actually. The. First. Video. Of. Alan. Becker. I. Saw. I can't believe that that video was in my home screen when I was kid and start me getting watching alls of your videos today! I didn't understood the video really good, before. But I started watching every single vids. You know what? Alan isnt an animator. He's a magician.
SO COOL!
Thw pig is definitely technoblade. Alan should make a video where Blue brews a potion that humanizes mobs and blocks. Like tuning the pig into technoblade, or a wolf into a werewolf, or something like that.
Techno blade never dies
Welcome to Gboard clipboard, any text that you copy will be saved here.
This hits hard after techno passed R.I.P blood God 🕊️
I feel like the bit where we see Blue as he's trapped in the mind of a piston, it's like the moment where he rethinks his life decisions and his nether wart addiction.
Wate ???
There's no way i was 12 when this video was released  😭
Nah ruben let technoblade take over for this one. "NOT EVEN CLOSE BAYBEEE" -technoblade , we will miss u 😢
ahh yes, Techno Power
13:40 ???????????????????
Even the is name say i gotta go fast when the pig drinks it
Purple acting like the youngest child at the end 😂
What kids feel when they get flicked ONCE: 11:39
Yo the pig went full GOD MODE on the witch bro😂
The pig absolutely destroyed the witch
11:40 Falcon PUNCH!
The pig had darkness how did he see?!
4:39 guess Minecraft physics don't exist
What is with Op pigs??? Idc i like it.
Technoblade never dies technoblade power forever
Nah the pig turned super saiyen fr
Green is cool
Fish is epic when fighting
Epic fight!!!!
When they do the arm thingy I always hear “didididdididudududutdutdu” bc it sounds right
11:17 mea pelea XD
Never knew a sugarcane could do such op moves also why are the pigs so strong in this show?
11:38 PLUS ULTRAAAA
Gotta go fast💀 11:15
nice refrence to one of the old videos with the pig getting every effect
This episode makes me so happy im kicking my feet in excitement rn
13:40 The little hand motion they do here is so adorable 🥰
Zombie is cooking
It’s all over when the pig gets potions… they are the ultimate life form
Fun Thing: 9:51 There's No Pig
It's always the pig who's the hero 😂😂😂 Always
The animation for the witch pretending to be blue right when orange came through the portal is everything. I love it
11:20 every anime fight when the hero has there true form:
The pig was insane
Techno Power💪
I just realized that the witch had no reason to trap the other stickmen if he only needed blue
The pig be my favorite for this one 🗿
10:43 SHAPE SHIFTER BATTLE  SHAPE SHIFTER BATTLE
Hes the witch
This is my favourite episode.
7:02 **insert Lone Ranger (William Tell Overture) Theme**
Okay
Blue needs to double punch then i'm in the piston can i double punch it and then you can i catch the berries i did not play minecraft
Bruh bruh bruh
He's right because technoblade is literally a minecraft pro that's like a pig costume with a with a 👑
11:37 death punch from one punch man
11:15
Allen i think you made a mistake when we see in the footage that the witch got the potion throw it's on the chest and that we see the pig is not there
The part that got me the most was when green ran out of potions😂😂😂😂😂 ,
2:08 İn really whips The llama zeez
Pig always rock😂😂
It's karate pork chop
ً
11:39team rocket is blasting off again
at climax ble and witch said "transformation jutsu"
11:16 you can see on one of the powers it says techno power man he was a legend
11:15 the fact that it said others twice
Favorite parts:  2:21 til 3:19🟡🟰🦙 3:32 til 4:13🔴🟰🐟 5:31 til 6:06🟢🟰🎍(I also like that they hugged the sugar cane at 5:52) 9:24 til 9:42 10:04 til 10:35 10:56 11:46
THe GOd OF piG
11:39 saitama reference
Hi sigmas
Pig is god🌬👽
Looks like technoblade never dies is the pig that's technoblade because she epic
Pig drank all the potions again😭
Where is the subtitle for the speech?
Probably, without a doubt, my favorite fight scenes so far. The sugar cane battle, Blue and the Witch shifting between forms, and then the pig going God Mode on the witch were all just amazingly brilliant.
now that i think of it,are all mobs humans?used to be?did the witch turn all of humanity into mobs?
*witch=more potion=death*  makes sense
Techno power still carried💀
Um why is pig not invisible because he has the invisible effect 🤓
I will got coke
the pig is always the one that saves them lol
At 4:12 to 4:13 you can see the alpacas face through orange’s Lmao
This pig is turning a genius of fighting too
Тіминг в майнкрафте:прісидати шивтом Тіминг в бравл старс:крутитися Стикмени:махати руками
Is it me or did I see two orange stick figures?
Super pig is back
7:33 i recognize that sound
I watch this wideo at 2024  Not even close baby technoblade never dies
As for me, a green parrot would be more suitable for Green. Considering his artistry and love for music. And he literally can sing.
i dont remember this being 3 years old
11:20 Technoblade has returned.❤🎉🎉
11:15 one of the effects is TechnoPower. mah heart❤‍🩹  Rest in Peace, Blood God
What’s the weight on his command this one from Yaquina Bay Beach to Evo so come on come on this one in Foerster Comanche but the Mr. one is what
I honestly love how Alan just took all his ideas from season the earlier episodes and just turned them into an adventure in the later ones
Ahh the triumphal return of Megapig!
2:09 "A LLAMA? HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD"
TECHOBLADE never dies
4:57 Only Alan Becker can make a salmon with a diamond sword fighting a witch disguised as a zombie pretending to be Green holding two diamond swords seem like a normal thing.
Super pig strikes back
Yellow is Lamma, Red is salon, Green is Sugar Came, Blue is Piston
Ngl I love red's pig so much
At 11:15 there's such a sad Easter egg :((( The 7th effect on the 4th row is so sad. The effect is 'Techno Power', which reminds me about Techno blade who died of cancer. You may rest in peace Techno, fly High for us🕊️🎮🥀😭😣
Pig💀
11:15 PAUSE THE VIDEO! Techno Power = Technoblade (rip my guy😢) and Gotta Fast = Sonic The Hedgehog
Actually my son does
I love animation vs…

Easter egg:Theres Gotta Go Fast Thing when the pig Has potion power so sonic is here? And TechnoPower We know this Pig Is Technoblade Technoblade never Dies
I like how the zombie didn’t burn in the sun😂
11:30 killer move... Serios series... Serios punch
Note to self: don’t leave a angry pig unattended (can’t believe this is the third time I’ve seen this)
8:26 WALLE!!!
Poor lama😢
Pig❤
The stickmans: OMG WE ARE GOING TO DIE    meanwhile with the pig: Ｉ　ＡＭ　ＴＨＥ　ＬＥＧＥＮＤ O ＭＡＥ　ＷＡ　ＭＡＵ　ＳＨＩＮＤＩＲＵ  witch: Nani, who said that
I almost cried when I saw in the potions effects that it said “Techno Power” as one of the buffs 😭😭  Technoblade never dies ❤❤
I love how one of the effects on the pig was "gotta go fast" and "techno power"😆
pig? No One Pig Man. Yes
GOD PIG RETURNS!!!!!!!!
at 11:15 i was checking the enchantments the pig had and i saw techno power which is really cool but if t his video was released after he died it would be insanely respectful for a popular youtuber like him.

Gotta go fat effect on pig
Man that pig went super sayan on the witch
Flappy flappy 13:39
Your telling me 4 stick figures that have the born ability to fight and a stick figure who is stronger than all of them combined when at full power CAN'T beat a witch who knows how to create potions of shape shifting,and teleportation. But  a P I G CAN
the pig was actually technoblade.

Red straight up became killerfish💀
Pig will always be my favourite character
I love that 2 of the potion effects the pig got was "Gotta Go Fast" and "Techno Power"
This one really has some Odyssey moments in it lol
The way he looks at the chest  reminds me of wall-e 8:31
Ah.. i see. It's callback to AvsM Season 1 Episode 4.🤩
Make an episode about the pig
Lesson learned potions + pig = super powerful being also that big had gotta go fast potion effect
And it was prophesied that when they needed him most, Technoblade would return!
Hmmm hasayone seen the leaves in the background theres a face on the leaves at 7:53 just look at the leaves theyre angry is it only me who noticed this
11:15 AHAHAHAHAH Gotta Go Fast effect, Sonic fan is happy!
I seriously love how everytime they go through the portal they wave their arms XD
Fish Red with the sword is just ✨✨✨✨✨✨
I find it funny that Orange almost kick the fish ( Red ) back into the water before Ruben stopped him
7:51
7:48
OP PIG RETURNS
The pig got some moves fr .
Without the potions the pig is just a pig. But with the potions, he becomes as strong as TCO. In fact, the pig with the potions should help TCO in this year’s AvA
Это было покруче всяких блокбасьеров😮
10:29 buzz lightyear meme

Pig jast get's "TECHNO POWER"
Techno Power
6;17 blue probably is on drugs due to the fact that his addicted ti nether wart or in my eyes drugs thats maybe why his in  a room of white
I WAS NOT EXPECTING THE PIGGIE POWER, BUT I AM SO HAPPY ABOUT IT
11:36 uno reverse
Puerco insano a llegado a la batalla😂😂
so I counted in 0.25x speed…  after the pig dodged all the potions, he made a combo of about 40 hits. even in slo mo, some parts were too fast to count lol
I just realized that the pig had an invisibility effect… tiny error lol
Fun Fact: Literally no one here is w girl!

The god pig
Hero of the village through potion? Bruh
I have a theory about the pig.           The pig is a container that houses Technoblade’s soul, and it guides the figures and aids them as well.
Люблю твои ролики очень заннмательны❤

Jajajajaj technoblade and sonic refence in 11:15
We remember technoblade 11:14
everyone of the main character became a villain/possessed of some kind The chosen one=when he saw his friend die and got his powers, Red= when herobrine possessed, him, Yellow= the noteblock possessed him, Blue=the witch pretended to be him  I wonder if green will become a villain or get possessed
Me before I cook dinner: Watching Alan Becker's animations After I cook dinner: Just watching more of Alan Becker's animations past midnight Me in the morning:*wakes up* *Turns on phone*  🥱 *large yawn* *looks at phone sees animation from Alan Becker* whooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

bro is this what people call a rare breed pig XD
TECHNO POWER
So i am understanding the differences between the figures. Green knows how to work a fishing rod in combat and likes music, blue is a sharpshooter and is addicted to nether wart, yellow knows redstone. Orange can craft and is the leader, and red likes animals. Is that right
11:17 go
Morale of the history:dont fight with a pig when IS much strong then you
I never saw a Fighting pig wow how cool

0:17 they all hired for the diamond company😂😂
GIGA PIG
“ a fish can’t fight” the fish:
Am I the only one who thinks the pig is a reminder of technoblade
did anyone else realize that the Witch disguise as SC even though she didnt know him? seems a too fishy for minecraft mob to have such knowledge of stickmen, let alone specific ones, almost like someone told, or showed her, who to watch out for...
Let's respect blue because he almost burned to death in the episode before this and gets turned into dye
Did anyone else notice one of the potion effects was “techno power”?
Don't mess with the pig god dame

You know they’re bad when they’ve angered a *GOD DANM PISTON*

the pig is probably one of the strongest characters                        and probably one of my favorites.
God damn, it only time 30 seconds for the pig to absolutely obliterate the witch like technoblade does to orphans (rip king o7)

Pause before clicking this but an Easter egg from sonic is at this exact time on the middle left row at the bottom find out for yourself! 11:15
Another thing that I love about it is that reds pig acts as a scent hound, which makes sense because a pigs sense of smell is 2,000 times more sensitive than a humans
did the pig just turn into one punch man

I love the everlasting joke of the op pig
top 10 anime fights: zombie vs tsc, fish, pig, and Llama
11:39 now, the Witch is not dead (or should not be dead) (also, a minor spoiler alert)  She got turned into a dye, which is not a problem considering it's not a permanent effect She also got yeeted ridiculously far away, but that is also not a problem, since (spoiler alert)     since the King survived the same with no injuries (well, he was in creative mode, so makes sense)
11:38
11:15 if you look closely, it says techno power
Mi amigo: le puse hacks al puerco de Minecraft ahora puede golpear El puerco: empiezen a rezar 💀
Moral of the story: don't look for drugs  Also when the heroic pig punched the witch it kinda looked like a saitama reference
When the super pig super pushed her I passed and she is bigger then my d-
Mui pig
Who else noticed the pig had a techno power effect?
THE PIG DOES IT AGAIN!
I love at green as sugar cane...He's so good at fighting ❤
Pig vs Witch be like: Pig: hit hit uppercut combo. Witch: ooooffffffffff
The Pig was to powerful Alan had to get rid of it so his future antoganists wouldnt be taken down so easily
I AM MORE FLAWED, WITH THIS I CANNOT STOP WATCHING THIS SERIES I HAVE TO WATCH THIS UNTIL THE END
Este tipo se fuma algo para sus videos 😂😂😂😂
Only until the pig drinks every potion everyone looks weak
Am I the only one who wants to know why Orange had a hotbar/inventory row of different colors of wool for no apparent reason?
Everybody gangsta till the pig drink 1 potion
The Pig: How did we get here
Did anyone see one of the effects on pig say: got to fast
11:18 is the strongest in their verse
The Pig Went Full Tryhard Mode :P
Naw dat pig is powerful-

Damn, Reuben went ballistic on that witch.

After 2 years. Im now wondering why TSC And Blue didn't just throw milk on them.
My favorite is red
i love the at the pig got a potion called TECHNO PIG
The pig just ended everything in 20 seconds
11:33 was so incredible that i repeated 7 times to confirm it

jBUBHII
The pig was like techno blade 😂❤
i already saw this like 104 times and i don't get tired!!
i swear that pig is technoblade
11:15 "techno power"
Idc if Alan watches one punch man or not but I'm considering when the pig started jumping to the witch a bunch of times a reference to one punch man
11:15 Techno power effect?!
ໃນ
I love that at 11:15 that one of the potion effects is labeled "Techno Power" when the mob that's getting the effect is a pig and this is a cool reference to Technoblade.
Techoblade never dies 🗣️🗣️🗣️
This plays out like a Chinese myth
I do not look like a dirt block
7:40 this is now the reason why green is my favorite character
Witches are tough to know... They're tough to beat... Those potions are... dead?
Moral of the Story: Give your pets drugs
"achievement get: how did we get here"
13:42 wassup wassup wassup wassup wassup lol
strong pig 💪🐷
One of the potions said, techno power
so some of the pig's potion effects actually aren't even in effect and a couple of them are non-existent, for example: gotta go fast
only alan becker could turn blocks, a llama, a pig, and a fish into ninjas lol
I still get caught off guard by how well choreographed everything is. A stellar animated series.
Pig have observation haki 💀
Tehnoblade never Die ❤
Bro the pig uno reversed the witch lol
Some. Of the effects shown twice use both pre texture update and post texture update effect icons
I'm quiting minecraft if wiches fought like that. 😅
Thats pig just learned kung fu in 2 seconds💀
How did this foreshadow camels
11:16 How he is visible he have the invisible effect active
The pig does it one agen.
If the pig did scadooch  11:38 like poo from con fo panda
bruh the pig had a combo
11:12 i did not think that an anime battle between a pig and a witch would be so epic
IT'S PIG TIME!!!
Nah bro the witch almost got beaten by a fish that’s some serious skill issue
Did you notice Sonic and Technoblade refrences in the video? I bet not. Check the potion effects on the pig.
❤Alan você é especial ❤🤭
11:15 ..One of the potion effects is "Gotta Go Fast"..? Y'see- U-C-- _THAT..._ is a mere _SIGN._ _"Animation vs. Sonic the Hedgehog."_          But I can see he's got better things to do, so... Not now.
bro got beatdowned  by a pig😂😂😂😂😂
At this point, Reuben is simply HIM

The pig is technoblade RIP one year since he died
Omg of blue hadn’t gotten to orange in time Orange wouldn’t be with us
Does someone notice that on 11:15 there stands Gotta go fast with a Sonic ring
I was honestly not expecting a sugar cane fight with a witch 💀
obsessed w the way i audibly said "Oh, not again..." at 11:10
Obsessed with how Red clearly learned a bit from his possession if he could fight that well while being a FISH.
Is it just me, or do the animals always make the best characters? Like, the pig is becoming a recurring character and I love it, the parrots were really funny in the texture pack episode, and the chicken was amazing in the note block episode. I love this whole show so much.
11:15 Its time to become OP!  Best enchantment there is : GottaGoFast
Can we appreciate how the pig beat the crap out of the witch
Its good that you put techno power  For the pig😂
E
amazing reference to when the pig got every good potion effect back in season one
*Villain turns a protagonist into llama using a potion*  I sense a reference here.
11:16  TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES
11:15 Look at all the effects Notes: There are 3 instances of fire resistance **2** "Gotta go fast" Using new and old icons It's a big mess.

Can somebody explain for me why purple is there?i remember in one episode they was put into jail by villager (bad English)
Pig god
Pig fite op😂😂
I literally finished the series yesterday and this has got to be a top 10 anime fights. The fact that they used the elements of the previous episodes(The texture battle, and the combat pig episodes) was fucking genius as the choreography for this episode was on point even though the main crew fought as fish and stuff. I don't know if this beats the King orange fights but it 100% is a banger
The mega pig returns
I love the references so much Blue swimming like a squid as a piston, The witch transforming the crew into blocks in Minecraft Prop Hunt, switching into the axe because that’s the seeker’s weapons
i just realized one of the pigs buffs was techno power 😂
Beautiful wonderful and fantastic
Faites un autre Épisode
Ah shit! here we go again...
I like green when he was sugar cane and piggy I saw a buff called techno power I think

We were all gangsta till Ruben started fighting

11:10 pay close attention to the effects the pig has. First off, he has hero of the village, which wouldn't help him in any way. He also apparently has invisibility, but it doesn't work, and levitation, which also doesn't work. Most importantly, he has, "Gotta Go Fast," which is an obvious reference. A less obvious reference is "Techno Power, which is a reference to Technoblade. Wow I wrote a lot
El verde tocando la cancion de la pelea de musica
11:14 I like it how you added “gotta go fast” and “tecno power” as custom effects when the pig gets all the powerful affects

The pig resembles technoblade
01:18 Neither Stick fights not Minecraft animation should slap this hard! It's illegal! Every fight scene is always better than the previous.

このアニメは本当に豚がいい活躍する✨️🐷
サトウキビ草

In the end pig mastered ultra instint and defeat which
This reminds of of Slamacow's Witch Encounter episode. Which was apparently 9 years ago...wow, I remember that.  Slamacow has unfortuantely left making Minecraft content. He still works with Laura Shigihara though.
Moral: always have a pet pig
Sad Fact: one of the enchantments on the pig is "techno power", R.I.P.
Ironically, zombies couldnt be under the sun. The zombie cover as witch was already a hint and I barely noticed until it was revealed
The pig is always the elite character
THE PRIME PIG
4:45 "dreams have meaning"  My dreams:
The way Green walk as a bamboo
Dragon ball Z
The Pig:Turns Into Made In Heaven When Drinking Witch:Why Did I Not Thing Of That
9:24 look how they run lol
I already perceive them not as the creation of Alan, but as separate individuals
11:38 my hero reference?
At 11:15 did anyone see when the pig drank the potions one of them said techno power? May he rest in peace

Did that just say techno power?
POV: witches and pigs in hard-core
Super pig from animation vs minecraft ep 4

7:56 the one who made the most progress in that fight was the block of sugarcane
The pig is technoblade because when it drank the potions at the last row I said techno power
11:14 Advancement unlocked: How did we get here?

I like how consistently whenever the pig is in a real episode he becomes a god
hay loquendo de alan
What the hell is techno power?! 11:15
This is better than dragon ball z
The only thing I could not like is how he does not use the “game” effect from super smash bros when the pig decimates the witch
wadafakyou alan becker
11:15 😮
Loved the techno power buff for the pig
Wh-what!  There is no part 2 ☹️ ok.😞

Hi Who is this her or her to 18 take man by buried in
9000000000000000000000
HHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAA
I love how in the fight scenes, everything is almost overwhelming fast. It’s not going to fast that I can’t tell what’s going on, and it’s easy to follow along what’s happening, the feelings of the characters, (etc). And in the end, the plot twist with the pig saving the day, it’s beautiful, I’ve been subscribed for about 4-6 years and I just can’t put into words how indescribably amazing all of this is. I love this channel and I feel like it should be the most subscribed channel on YouTube. Thanks so much for making these outstanding videos that make me feel like I’m in there with these characters. And to anyone who is reading this, I would recommend this channel above any other on YouTube. Great job. I can’t wait to see more!
Happy New year to 2023
The pig just got a new power caled one Punch pig
journey to the west XD
How am I still the only one noticing that there are two oranges?

Pig: you obviously forgot about me... now I'm gonna go technoblade on you
かっこよすぎだろ。もうこれさた豚最強じゃんマイクラで1番弱そうなのに
some of the pigs buffs were *"gotta go fast"* and *"Technopower"* *super pig fight flashback*
Scott Buckley wrote music for this episode!! I love it so much https://youtu.be/VWHTlq5Fcr8?t=758
11:39 destroy SMASHHHHHHH
How the hell does Alan make such an engaging and understandable fight scene where one of the combatants is a sentient crop of sugarcane??
the fact that he made a FISH look good when fighting is showing his amazing talent
is it real in computer?
the purple coming back from the portal and seeing everyone go away and then sitting there and crying broke my heart Alan, it broke my heart
Master pig!
Top ten strongest anime characters to ever exist number 1 pig
🤣
For some reason I felt like making a timeline for what they transformed into: Witch - SC Witch = Witch Blue = Piston Witch = Blue Red = Salmon Yellow = Llama Green = Dirt Block Witch = Witch Witch = Zombie Witch = Witch Red = Cobblestone  SC = Carved Pumpkin Green = Melon Yellow = Haybale Green = Green Blue = Blue Yellow = Yellow SC = SC Red = Red Green = Piston Red = Red Mushroom Block Yellow = Gold Block SC = Magma Block Green = Green Yellow = Yellow SC = SC Red = Red Red = TNT Red = Red Yellow = Bee Nest SC = Acacia Planks Yellow = Yellow Green = Slime Block Yellow = Sponge SC = SC Yellow = Yellow Red = Iron Golem Red = Bed SC = Blaze Yellow = Blaze Red = Red Green = Elder Guardian SC = Orange Wool Yellow = Yellow Green = Green SC = SC Yellow = Witch Red = Redstone Block Yellow = Yellow Blue = Iron Golem Witch = Cave Spider Blue = Skeleton Witch = Wolf Blue = Polar Bear Witch = Blaze Blue = Snow Golem Witch = Witch Blue = Blue Blue = Blue Dye Yellow = Yellow Dye Green = Green Dye Red = Red Dye SC = Orange Dye Blue = Blue Green = Green SC = SC Yellow = Yellow Red = Red
11:16 here we go again..
Idk why but I want a mod where fish, llama and sugar cane can hold weapons and fight now
I see the pig when he have the effect invisible (on the botten of the head of the pig) I'm not the only one who see this. Sonic and Technoblade reference. And the double luck effect is normal? Sad that technoblade died from he cancer, he was a good youtuber who give smile.
♥︎☻︎
THE PIG IS SOO OP
When is the new episode of ava  🤨🤨🤨
Alan fights are so good
The pig bro.. ☠
Alguém BR?

Technoblade
Pig rocked. Witch shocked
Pig= techno
0:27 there was no woosh when blue put is hands up (sorry i just noticed it lol its fine)
The Pig vs Witch should have an epic song over the fight
Ggggggggg
11:50 , if you turn on captions it says "thank you" while and after they drink the potions.
👍👍👍👍👍😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃koooooooooooooo!

BAD ZOMBIE! 4:46
FROGS? 11:02
FROG? 10:57
This man shows how pig are strong
I wonder if the pig was a foreshadowing of herobrine because it was the pig who fought the stickman and died then come back to fight a common enemy and is good which tells of red/herobrine fighting the stickman and died then fighting against a common enemy and is good.
Ah yeah, gotta go fast potion is so op
11:15 R.I.P Techno, always missed but never forgotten. Hope I'm not the only one that saw that in the potion effects.
Alan you are the best❤
11:15 the strongest mob in the game has awoken again
technoblade's   Op  guardians
Witch so strong idk how him using combat sword so fast like even green attack a lot witch can block almost all attack 7:44
Hi Alan becker
ULTRA INSTINCT PIG
Techno power ????
Alright why is the witch such a swordmaster tho
I thought we didn’t like purple? Why are they acting buddy buddy?  Edit: I went back to make sure I wasn’t crazy and yeah, they definitely put purple in jail for destroying the city and letting blue and green almost die
Me gustaría que sacarás la segunda parte
its weird how nobody knows what they are saying but everybody knows what they are saying in these ones
Techno never die
Ohio average pig
Minute 11:15 gotta go fast
いつも思うけど豚が有能すぎる
This was like Circe and Odysseus
11:23
Down in ohio...
Свинья просто имба
Watching 13:40 without context…
I saw the footage of 9:48-10:33 be used in a mobile game ad called stickmen vs craftmen
Super
that witch really pulled a yzma move
This pig is so cute uwu
11:15 he got techno power 🥹 I’m gonna cry
Is this a OPM reference?
When the pig drank the potion u can see techno power
Это просто всё хорошо я не играла
It
only in ohio💀 13:43
It's a repeat of the pig drinking all the potions
A better title for this should be "Super Porky. The return".
Hola
Bro purple fuckin left them for dead in the void and went for the egg causing the destruction of their own town, why do they suddenly act so happy to see them again
And here we see: The Most Intense Game of Freeze Tag  (see: Witch turning them into objects, Blue turning them back with another potion)
The pig fight at 11:15 is a nice callback to the potions episode.
11:15 the pig has a buff called “techno power”. TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES!
the peppa pig is very angry and strenght
11:18 this ain't a short anymore this an anime fight 👽
Every body gangsta till the pig drinks some potion 💀
Super pig to th restchu pov dont now how to spell lol
Bro the pig just ultra combo chained that witch.
Pig literally goes light speed when he drank some potion
한글좀써

이분 엑션이......ㄷㄷ
4:44 I call this….  Fish Of Fighting teaming up with others  7:40 I call this….  Sugar Cane of Kung Fu teaming up with others  Fighting section ⬆️  9:03 I call this….  Piston of Agility making the best potion  9:07 End of potion making
Yes purple
when ever the pig gets potion effects the world suddenly becomes dragon ball
I dont usually comment on these videos but oh my GOD the creativity of the battle scenes here. The way the Green as the sugar cane fights is so cool. And the callback to the potions video when the pig drinks all the potions? Absolutely lovely, I can tell so much love and passion goes through these animations
11:13 TECHNOBLADE ORIGINS
How good are you at this cuz I seen you another one that's my favorite one and you are the bestest whole YouTuber in the whole entire world how can I repay you I don't know how this will what is this game is this some FNAF analogy what you look so good oh better did a ninja you actually better than lanky box another YouTuber you probably don't even know you better than anything in the whole entire time to make YouTube videos you should make a movie about this
AVERAGE DAY IN OHIO
I like how green uses the sugar cane to fight 😂
I can imagine blue saying: "Soda tables have turned, witch!"
THE PIG SMACKED THHE FREAK OUTTA THAT WITCH AND KILLED THEM😂😂😂😂
Х
Ich was das hier niemand Deutsch sprechen kann aber Alan Becker ist der beste Youtuber ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bruh that Bannock gun
Pig after getting every effect: Time for WAR!

Pig having a deadly effect of techno power
12:05 Purple picking flowers for his mum?

13:41 Sticky dance
Piggy power Before potion: lvl 20 After potion: lvl god
11:37 GO BEYOND      PLUS ULTRAAAAAAAAAA
I like the pig
Bro that fish fighting was epic
That Technoblade easter egg really hit home. When the pig drinks the potion you can see “Techno power” to the far left
0:27 The fake Blue has muffled sound effect! Is it because this one's fake so it had a difference between the group??
At 11:14 i saw techno power... did yall saw techno power and R.I.P TECHNOBLADE
3 new potion effects *technopower* *glowing* *gottagofast*
i love Alan Becker 🥰
Anyone at 4:45 notice how the witch was carrying 2 swords? Then only uses one at the fight at the hut? Everyone should know green’s fighting style where he sometimes uses 2 swords in fights instead of one so i think the witch used green’s fighting style against them
Everybody gangsta till the pig drinks a potion
I thought purple was created by the purple dye which the witch turned into
hi
Great animation, Alan!
the techno power was wayy before he died stop saying he added it because he died
Cursed The Witch Green is Sugar Cane Yellow is Llama Red is Salmon And Blue is Pistons The Second Coming Have To Help
Fun fact: this is just a test fight battle for final episode
Pig will destroy this world?
i find it kinda… idk, ironic? that blue was the first one kidnapped by the witch like, blue is the one who discovered potions, and was kidnapped by a mob that uses potions
IT'S THE PIG FROM THE POTIONS EPISODE
This is a clash between a The Witch and The Second Coming And Friends
HOw many times will the pig save the day
0:00 oh right, a witch- 1:45 he lost his friends' trail again, and this is not even the last time- I kinda feel bad about it- 2:01 lucky we have our Pig! 2:33 Do they have actual names or it's just the color of them? (TSC doesn't counts) 2:43 he said "hold up, I gotta check first" 3:15 he really did that with a llama body? 9:25 why is this kinda funny to watch? 11:10 you're done witch 12:03 this again- 12:38 oh the worse is coming for you- 13:25 I heard something about his dad, is something bad happened to his dad and he's doing all of these to help him or something? (It's not really a question it's just a theory and I don't like spoilers so please don't say anything about it- I just heard that it's something about his dad)
9:24 Hive hide and seek be like
Pig enters full ultra instinct: 11:10
Pig op
11:12 You best believe I saw the "Techno Power" potion effect. Man I love it here
Great animation, Alan!

"Ultra instinct pig is not real, It cannot hurt you." Ultra instinct pig: 11:23
I'm now emotionally attached to the pig, please don't kill it.
I love how Blue and the Witch became each other's weaknesses at the end, like Snow Golem>Blaze or Wolf>Skeleton
11:13 how it feels to drink water in ohio
that pig is smarter den me
Hi, Alan! I just want to say: your animations are so cool! Thanks a bunch for entertaining us with your videos, they're cool, and also funny, and also, what do you call the thing the Pig did in 11:25-11:27? You know, him fighting the witch after drinking all the potions?
Anime:we are better Alan becker:welcome to the rice fields mother animaters
Alan Becker is the best
The pig is so cool
Wait, I just realised, the texture for the obsidian on the portal is the old one despite everything else using the new texture
I'm sorry sis, when I threw the which into the chest, why did the pig disappear?
4 v 1 witch wins 1 v 1 pig wins no dif
Techno power
Everyone gangester till pig has all positive effects but it has ten at the end. The pig becomes MUI Goku in a minute.
свинья под зельями соло

Technoblade lmao
9:51 Wait WHERE DID THE PIG GO?
Bru these fights are better than anime 😝
Ah yes, techno power and gotta go fast, my favorite!
So don’t attempt it
And you can never enter it
I’m in my own world
Those arnt even stick figured
There are so many reasons I hate you
It’s confirmed. Pigs can fly
So I think it is not bad and to the world is a big difference ☺️
Imagine getting your ass beaten by a Llama, a fish, some sugar cane, and a pig
What effect of. Techno potion
Everyone gangster until the king comes
11:10God mode pig😂
That pig with all potions
11:13 Watching this scene made me notice something.  At the right of the screen says that Reuben got the Techno Power. Reminds us of Technoblade.
lets be real, pig is strongest
no joke this is. THE best fight choreography I've ever seen, holy shit
the pig is very similar techblade
13:42 this part bruhh
The fact that in the good effects that were given to the pig is also "Techno power" hits different now ngl Rest in peace king 👑
The fact one of the enchantments the pig got was techno power😶
Pig In God mode 11:15
Fish/Red in god mode in moments 4:58
11:14 the pig had an invisibility effect but did not become invisible
pig=technoblade

Piggy ultra instinct punch 👊👊👊 awesome 💥💥💥🔥🔥
When They are about to enter purple’s portal be like: 13:39

When I see the pig kill the witch,in mind:oh hell nah I will never kill pigs again
11:15 oh yeah Techno Power
牛逼
this pig is surely a relative of the pig from the potions episode
There’s multiple duplicates of potion effects, but some have their old texture and som have new, there is 3 absorption, one effect called techno power, and one effect called gotta go fast there is one more potion that is not real, you can only see a part of it at the pig’s snout, but it doesn’t look like any other effect.
A super pig vs a witch lol
Poor green, got turned into bamboo
Did anyone else notice that one of the pigs buffs was "gotta go fast"?
I like how when Blue had no more potions instead of throwing the empty bottles at the witch he just kinda gave up (would have been funny to See that if im honest)
Does anyone notice the glowing effect At 11:14
Looking in the background off all the pigs affects and one was named gotta go fast
la droga gente :)
The only thing they fear... IS YOU 11:07
I didn't know i needed to see a fish yield a sword until i saw it  edit: i commented too early. watching sugar cane fight was... an experience
technopower kkkkkkkkkk
i just realise now that part that the pig drinks all of the potions one effect is called 'gotta go fast' with a ring of sonic as the icon
I love the "gotta go fast" and "techno power" buffs🤣♥
11:10 Ruben 2.0
Green vs With is epic.
if you look at the potions the is 1 called techno power
Hey Alan Someone Stole Your Animation Into Ads!

I like how everyone is talking about green as a plant but red is still fighting as a fish
11:16 The origin of Technoblade
The stickmen's PVP skills are immaculate. Even when they get turned into ridiculous things, they still manage to do wonders in combat. 11:13 THE RETURN OF THE SUPER PIG! 13:40 Humina humina humina humina humina humina humina humina humina humina humina humina humina humina humina humina...
The pig is a good memory of technoblade
Technoblade never dies!!

11:15 what is that 'gotta go fast' and 'techno Power' at right and down???
Шаринган
Bro green as sugar cane fighting the witch solos every other fight in the episode
Anyone else think it would've been great to see blue using potion combat in later episodes? Playing to his strengths between archery and brewing would've made for some interesting fights.
11:15. A potion effect is Techno Power :D
"You're one of my friends? Do something only they would do." Yellow: redstone mad science to make a little minecraft mannequin yellow stick figure Red: scratches the pig in juuust the right spot Green: *JAM* Blue: brews up potions to change back to normal without arms, legs, or opposable thumbs
Techo power??????
Epic wideo
The first time I watched this video I was like: "the pig knows.."  Then what do you know the next episodes the pig do be slaying.
11:15 here is effect called 'gotta go fast' its on down line
11:15 Who Obserced Techno Power
Tge crazy story is begin🎉
bro used a llama as if it was a horse💀
animation logic how red did not died when he stay out of the water bucket so long ?  logic 2 at the moment of the witch throw the green poison at the chest as u can see there no pig in the cage  logic 3 the pig fight with the witch  the witch just throw a lot of poison but the poison did not hit the stick figure
techno power oh thats why...
I just realized the pig is so strong or drank so many potions that he had speed 2 twice
Technoblade
Let's appreciate how Alan Becker has never lost their touch over the years and always makes the best animations.

Damn for the pig there were 3 Easter egg potions. Conduit power? Techno power? Gotta go fast? Also how it's visible with invisibility potion? How levitation potion in fighting? Dolphins grace? Water breathing? Glowing? Haste? Luck? Hero of the village?  Not judging, just wondering. You're my favorite animator ♡

Just so that people are aware, some developer (maybe company? not sure) called Bui Thi Ha just ripped the fight from 10:00 to 10:30 ish and used it in an ad.  The game is called Stickman Arena and from the reviews it seems like a LOT of stuff in that game is stolen from multiple sources

It's hilarious that when the Pig becomes Super Pig, it just mops the floor with the Witch. All the other times it took an entire team of 5 guys to stand against her and they still almost lost, but the pig is just so powerful that the Witch just stood no chance.
The pig is like technoblade  when he drink the potion  he turned in God mode haha RIP technoblade 😇😇😇

I really like this animation however I recently got a mobile ad that was using this video, nothing was changed except there was a logo for the game and the there was terrible music in the background, this is just stealing for money should you be worried? (You don’t have to respond I’m just putting it out there)
what hapen
10:22 I guess red actually wanted to play "bedwars"

11:15 one of the effects says technopower
seeing sugar cane beat the shit out of a witch is awesome
Ah yes, gotta go fast and techno power, 2 of the many effects that were added in minecraft 1.37 potion update
Ok so by slowing down the footage of the fight, I can deduce that the left witch is yelo, and then they switch positions, so then the right witch is yellow, which makes sense cuz later on the witch plays portal
So was the with the purple guy ?
Techno Power
One of the effects was techno power rip technoblade
This is the best animation I ever seen

Oh GOD! THE PIG HAS GONE ULTRA INSTINNCT!
Are those stiic man acsholy in your pc
8:04 *wall-E*
Súper pig
11:16 Nah that pig just went ultra instinct😰
11:14 The God Pig returns
11:15 It says that the pig has invisibility, so why is it still visible?
As we can see: - Red is good at textures - Yellow is good at redstone - Green is good at noteblocks - Blue is good at potions - Animator AKA Orange is good at parkour
Blue re-emerges from the Nether Portal, where he's relieved to be back in a... swamp? Wait a minute, this isn't ALANSPC! He asks The Second Coming, who had just appeared, who gestures to Blue to come closer. As Blue does so, he sees the true identity of the fake Second Coming off-camera and tries to run, but is hit with a potion, and disappears.  The real Second Coming, Green, Red and, Yellow come out of the portal shortly after, where they reunite with Blue. Showing that Blue managed to obtain some Nether Wart, the Stick Figure Team celebrate and leave. Blue, however, seems hesitant to leave, and stops Red. One at a time, the remaining stick figures go back in the portal, as each stick that went before them takes longer and longer to return. TSC is the last one to enter the portal again. Finding that the other stick figures are nowhere to be seen, TSC confronts "Blue", who suddenly begins attacks TSC with a barrage of potions. Fending the attacks off, TSC manages to pin "Blue" to the ground, who turns out to be a witch that has captured the Fighting Stick Figures. The witch then drinks a potion of invisibility, and disappears.  TSC feels hopeless now that the Witch is gone, but Red's Heroic Pig (Reuben) comforts him. They set off in search of the other stick figures. As they are searching, they come across a group of llamas. The Heroic Pig sniffs out Yellow, and as TSC walks by, one of them makes llama noises, claiming to be Yellow. TSC nearly celebrates, but he had to test the llama first, telling it to build a redstone contraption to prove whether or not the llama is indeed Yellow (because Yellow is a genius at Redstone Minecraft). The llama ends up building a contraption that makes an armor stand of Yellow. Satisfied, TSC gives Yellow a yellow tapestry, and the three set off once more.  While crossing the swamp, a salmon jumps on TSC and he shakes it off. They continued and the salmon lands next to TSC. He was about to kick it when Reuben stops him. It then sniffs the salmon after a while, and deduces that it is Red (salmon have red scales). TSC is still skeptical, so he holds some wool with different colors (which are their names) and is surprised when the salmon jumps at the red wool. Now convinced, TSC carries Red in a bucket, and the group continues.  The group soon comes across a zombie, which TSC tries to kill. However, before TSC attacks the Zombie, it motions for TSC to stop, and gestures itself to be Green. However, TSC forgot to test the zombie to see if it's really Green, and as the adventure goes on, the zombie suddenly begins to start attacking the group with a diamond sword in each hand. Confused, the Stick Gang fought back, before the zombie takes Reuben with it. The zombie takes out a potion, revealing itself to be the Witch, splashes it, creating a void, then escapes through it, taking Reuben with it.  TSC and the group grew hopeless again, and sat down. Without Reuben, they can't find Green, Blue, and the Witch. Suddenly, the sugarcane next to TSC nudges him, claiming to be Green. Wary due to the previous attack, TSC demands the sugarcane to prove itself, holding out a Note Block. The sugar cane then proceeds to play Jazzy Note Blocks, proving that it was Green. Green knows where the Witch is headed, so TSC shovels Green out and continue, this time to search for Witch and Reuben.  At the Witch's hut it is revealed that Blue has been transformed into a piston to harvest nether wart. However, Blue himself does not realize that he is a piston, he merely thinks he is sitting in a blank white place. Nether warts would regularly appear before him, but whenever he tries to grab them they would vanish again. Meanwhile, TSC, Red, Green, and Yellow, arrive at the Witch's hut and prepare to attack the witch. They hear Reuben squealing for help. This provokes Red, who attacks first but gets turned into cobblestone. Yellow throws TNT but the witch dodges it. Green is able to fight the witch the roof as a sugarcane, Yellow throws more TNT at the Witch, and the Witch continues to fight them back. Blue suddenly hears Yellow's TNT explosion, and is now able to move around. He looks for any potions, but the Witch is about to enter the room. Reuben warns Blue and Blue dives underwater, finding a brewing stand and a chest full of supplies. He starts making potions.  The Witch begins to win the fight by turning the rest of the group into useless and yet not immobile blocks. The witch is about to kill Green, but Blue throws a potion that turns him back into a stick figure. He throws potions at everyone else. They prepare to fight again, but the Witch throws a splash potion at her supplies, giving them life which provides the Witch with constant potions. Everyone begins fighting: the Witch uses her potions to turn the Sticks into useless objects, and Blue turns the Sticks into powerful mobs.    The Witch grabbed Yellow and turned him into a witch, so no one can tell who's who. TSC asked Red to get the potions, but the real Witch sneakily dropped a Void potion, which transported her to the hut. She ambushed Red and turned him into a redstone block and threw him out. They spilled a chest full of potions. Blue ambushed the Witch and both used potions to turn into various mobs to defeat each other, but in the end, Blue runs out of potions and the sticks are turned into colored dyes. The witch tries to burn them and nearly finishes them off, but suddenly, inside the hut, Reuben has drunk a bunch of the potions that were spilled from the chest. Reuben becomes super-powerful and launches itself at the witch, killing the Witch's moving chest supplies in the process. It begins doing crazy attacks on the Witch. The Witch tries to get away from the big by using a black hole, but the pig also went through it. The witch also tried to turn the pig into a colored dye, but the pig turns the witch into dye using its own potion against it. He finishes the Witch by giving it a super-powerful punch, sending the Witch far, far away. The pig goes back into the hut, pushes another chest full of potions that turn the dyes back into stick figures, making Reuben the Heroic Pig. All five of them hug Reuben.  Soon, everyone is about to leave the swamp, but they hear a sound. They see Purple, who is collecting blue orchids for no apparent reason. They have a reunion where Purple shows them another Nether Portal that he wants to show them. TSC remembers what happened the last time they went into an adventure: entering through unknown Nether portals, which lead to getting separated; TSC fighting the Killer Bunny; The Fighting Stick Figures escaping from the Drowned; and fighting the Spider King. Red begins to go first but TSC stops him, and tells everyone they should go home. As the five go home, Purple comes out. Red looks back and says they should follow Purple and see what he wants to show them. Everyone agrees except TSC, but he follows everyone to Purple anyway. They go through the portal and the episode ends.

Technoblade backstory
In honor of Technoblade Mojang should make a boss that u can summon by splashing a pig with the potion effects and it should be able to take on the Warden, and it shall be called ‘The God Hog’ or ‘Pig’
I personally find the God pig one of the most hilarious mobs in this series ever, and the most bad ass.

I like how orange is the main character in every video
when i watched this i was thinking to myself "there's no way terkoiz didn't work on this.  this is totally his style"  sure enough, he did.
I love that Alan doesn’t just portray the witch as an old frail woman who just wields potions, but a strong and resourceful person  who plays smart with potions and isn’t afraid to use weapons.
11:15 that pig has been training martial arts for 20 years
E muito legal

Bruuuh i got one of those ads that steals animations from this video on this video
The witch got folded 💀
🤏
😂😂😂
11:30 techno when he sees a child. r.i.p. you will be missed
The way the blocks walk around is so funny to me for some reason.
When the pig drinks the potions i saw 2 haste II and 2 easter egg potions and they are. Called gotta go fast and technoblade power
mow many times will this pig become a living anime
It was great when I saw the red fight as a fish
11:14 Just remembering when “Techno Power” was put in this just warms my heart R.I.P. Technoblade

I dont know how i missed the technoblade reference with the pig, but now i know and it hurts my soul
One of the effects that the pig gets is Techno power, it’s kinda sad. But also there is levitation, which is not a good effect. There are 2 luck effects (one is which is hidden around the pig face). And lastly, the is one called got to go fast, with a sonic ring. Nice animation. (:
Don't mess with the pig
Anime fans: goku is the strongest! Alan Becker fans: I beg to differ (shows video of god pig)
I love you videos
Blue: your not the only one that can make potions

When that one stickman fighting game ad spoiles the episode
Green as a sugar cane playing on the note block is so wholesome.
I wish I had the abilities of the pig but it was a permanent effect and I was also in creative mode
11:11 The pig after this: Challenge Complete! How Did We Get Here?
If you look closely at the pig's potion effects, you can see that she/he has "Techno Power", as In technoblade's power i think. I like all the details and RIP technoblade :(

Hey Alan, I love your work, it's always outstanding. I'm just hoping to let you know that some people are directly taking parts of this video, and running them as ads for whatever ripoff/scam/virus game they are creating. Whether you can do anything about that or not, idk, but I you can.
I don,t get it how can a fish fight
techno POWER HE IS DIED
As I was watching this, i literally got an ad with the fightscene where all the sticks fight against the witch. Its sad how people just steal your work for their own advertisement.

Hmmmmm, a pig is the most op thing in minecraft now XD
Top 10 anime battles XD
RED. IS A FISH... AND THE BUCKET XD FOGHMFLHBDFBSKTFEDBGLKDSJ. Alan how do you come up with these? XD
Alan Becker I saw an ad with game named Stickman VS Craftman and it used part of this animation. I don't know why the developers have done this.
You would have shown that after eating the techno power potion it transformed into technoblade and the alternative title of this video is the witch vs the stickmens and technoblade father. Because in story mode of minecraft 90 percent people believe that technoblade's father was pig.
pov; pig is the main person
is nice but werid
Red stickman : good at fighting Green stickman : musician Blue stickman : scientist Yellow stickman : Engineer Orange : Pro thinker
Alan you are the most biggest fan of minecraft. Me too! And how do you have that much subscribers??
THIS VIDEO HAS 1M LIKES!?

funny how at 11:15 it shows a potion effect called 'gotta go fast!' at the bottom right
TSC saying mean “build it”

bruh the fish is god
7:40 and 11:14 are amazing scenes
It' cool, the stickmans where blocks and animals :) :o
Lamma and fish with a sword?! LoL! Cool... :D
The reason why the pig won? When he drank all the potions and gained all the buffs, he also gained a buff called “Techno Power”.   *Blood for the Blood God.*
thank you for your insparation
Alen you probably won't see this but you inspired me to keep drawing stickmen,after 2yrs of practice I'm better at tham than ever
i really like the Combat of these animation. great job Alan

It must've sucked to become any of these, yellow carrying so much weight, blue in a piston with what he loves so close yet so far, green as literal sugar cane stuck to grass, and red as a fish out of water, tbf him flopping around in battle was hilarious lmao
the gotta go fast enchantment thingy though
11:15 Gotta go fast effect
The reason I like the image of Blue. When he is disguised by a witch, his image is amazing
Good I guess
Traduce lo que te voy a decir por favor enséñame a Aser esas editaciones chidas

Por que claro, lo puedes ver desde tu perspectiva y tomarlo asi, pero tengamos en cuenta que esta registrada como una existencia mas, si la quieres apreciar como: "es lo que recuerdo, es lo que te cuento y asi es" est bien, aunque tu vida no es lo que recuerdes, es lo que paso con realidad y hechos, y si lo tomamos de esa maners nuestra vida duraría poco mas de una decada, pero esta bien.

I love how if you pay attention, the gang enters the Overworld end of a portal, and leaves through a supposed Overworld end, which is later revealed to actually be taking place in the Nether. Little details like that make the story so much better through its consistency
Yo pause the video at 11:15 look through the positions and u will see techno power XD which means the pig is technoblade
Imagine how much it would suck to be a sentient block.
I just love how they wave their arms when their happy its just so cute my heart-

Hey Alan. A company used a scene from this video as an ad for thier game. Watch your content offline and keep looking.   The company who did it have a game called "stickman vs. Craftsman" get to them, and you'll be able to swing the hammer on them
Pppppppppiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiggggggggggggggggggggg!
5:00 Самая эпичная битва, которую видел)) Рыба с мечом :DD
Pig>Chosen One
Hey alan there is a mobile game called Stickman vs Craftsman and the creator used your animations for their ads
5:00 Alan is so creative to the point that he could make a fish fight with a zombie/witch. 7:17 he even made bamboo move by itself with a llama literally holding a flint in its mouth 7:35 now cobblestone interacts with living things. 7:42 bamboo can now sword fight 9:16 and apparently jack o' lanterns grew motor muscles 11:26 wow is that a pig with goku-like powers  This is why humanity is doomed. Either that or its Minecraft logic.
Nah, that pig is made by Satin himself
Alan, an ad for a stickman game called “Block Miner Craft World” is using your animations for their ads, did you give permission. This animation of the witch was in an ad,,  specifically the part where the which turned the stickman into dye.
11:18 Homie went hard on that beast
The fish is the real main character here
what kind of potion affect is techno power? harnesing technoblades power? Gotta go fast? sonic refference? cool
The pig beacome thecnoblade adter dricking all of the potion Lol
Cool
Power of stuf when they are bloc  Bamboo:can generate bamboo parts and use them as a gun or a bo staff  Fish:fish slap  Llama:weapon broke use spit  Piston:can leverage any block or enemies
lembre-se de manter o respeito nós comentários
is this the soul soul fruit???
I love how green (when he was a sugarcane) used himself as a weapon

Ad for Stickman vs Craftman just showed up here WITH the part of video. Just... why.
Pig > Dragon ball
Who said fish can't fly
SUPER PIG IS BACK
This is like really good nonsense but I like it imagine if you had a mod like that in Minecraft
Just love it when the pig becomes the equivalent of Minecraft god
ты про😃
I have seen to many ads on the fight scene in this
What is the name of that game
Bloody Witches! Always with their unconventional and silly-looking-but-extremely-deadly fighting skills and magical aptitude!   ...That sure was an odd yet subtle thumbnail for the video. Anyways, what a great action packed ep, this.   11:07: He'll surely never die.   12:00: Oh. You again.
Witch: Surprise😈
One punch pig
7:20lol, I heard SOS from the pig :)
Pig good
Nice vídeo
They really should create potion like those.
The pig is literally Kung Fu panda
Return of the god pig
This man somehow managed to make a fight between a plant and an old magical woman look amazing.
If the witch had a potion like that in the chest, why didnt he use it? hes able to create potions of all kinds. he should be pretty smart to use that potion.
11:08 It is very cool
This has 1m likes
11:58, PIGGY BACK RIDE!!!!!!!!

The pig is a God 💪🏻😎
The pig: THOSE THAT HURT MY FRIENDS WELL GET UNJUSTICE.REPAID 1000 TIMES OVER the witch:.ahhh crap
plot armor be like:
''Techno Power'' LOL
5:17 pig went to the backrooms
The Witch felt the power of the Blade
9:54 where's the pig?
Best thing: Minecraft is the Best
11:15 pause right there, you can see there is a potion effect called "Techno Power" which explains why he was so good
Super sayien pug
The pig isn’t invis, or even glowing. (Look at the enchants when the pig goes OP)
why is there so much super saiyan pigs
QUESTO É L'EPISODIO + BELLO  ×KE IL MAIALE É OP

I love thes video😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰🥰😍
11:15 was funniest moment
10:42 Blue: HYAAA
HOLY SHIT THAT PIG WAS AWESOMEE
you know its a fatality when the pig drank potion
lmaoo sugarcane got moves
At 11:15 there is a power-up named 'Techno Power ' 🤣🤣🤣
I saw one mistake when the witch was turning the chests and brewing stands to life the pig was not in the cage
The god mode pig is back
Ok🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
I just sees a potion effect of techno power
He brought the over buffed pig back lol.
The pig also has a costume efeect like gotta go fast really like it
The pig is now my father
I like how the fight between blue and the witch is so similar to the fight between Merlin and the witch in Disney's sword in the stone.
So that's technoblades origin story
The takeaway is... Drugs and overdose can turn you into... Blocks? And a pig drinking any potion makes it a god? I mean that's the video, but... I think I don't understand the point.
ya pasó un año :( xd
Wait a sec purp was the witch
The fact that all animals and other things are the colors of those missing its really good
The Minecraft pig is the Best thing ever happened🤣
the fight with the witch is sooooo excellent :D
Mojang please make witches like this in minecraft

マインクラフトエビソードの中で1番好きなビデオです！
What 1jt like
My guy Alan can make all sorts of amazing stuff. Just like this animation!
There are a bunch of mobile apps taking your animations and using them for advertisement without credit. I keep coming across them when watching YouTube on my phone. Are you going to try to take them down? The games are just shameless cash-grabs littered with ads, so it's obvious that they're not fan games or anything.
So this is where the ads came from huh?
안녕하세요 전 2년전부터 이 채널에 동영상을 보고있는 디우라고 합니다 이동영상에 엑션은 상상을 초월한 급으로 멌있기에 당신을 존경합니다 이렇게 완성도 높고 멋진 만화를  만드시다니. 정말 대단합니다

Hey a company is using your animation for their ad, the games called "stickman vs craftman" or maybe a plural, anyway just wanted to let you know
ناها٨خغغ٨خاخةجةكف٥فصبىتققب
I was a year late but the pig fighting the witch just reminds me of super smash bros but with extra steps.
11:15 techno power
The pig is so savage xᴅ
Super pig has come back but this time to help
I love how dynamic the combat in these is
I just saw someone use this animation on their ad for a game, immediately realised it was your animation 🤣  But still pretty sure they need your permission to use an animation in their own ad, cuz I'm pretty sure otherwise the whole game is ripped off from ur animations
I don't know if you'll ever see this Alan, but some crappy mobile game is stealing your content and using it in their ads. I hope you can get this situation rectified ASAP, your animations are amazing, and people who steal them are awful :'(
nice
Que batalla más épica  craft

หมูMVP
That pig needs to be a smash bros character
Omg admin pig
How technoblade was born
Hey Alan some game named stickman vs craftsman is using the footage from this video I don't think they have the copyright license
There's someone who has been using your videos as an advertisement for a mobile game. The scene where the SFs fight the witch is one of them.

pov: ur playing minecraft and u get turned into a piston
Me gusta el puerquito 🐷💕
Me gusta el puerquito 🐷💕
something that I like about this series is that orange knows when to attack and when to shake hands, and let's not forget that he always tries to protect his friends even though red, blue, yellow and green think they are immortals that's why he always sleeps since he is always protecting them 😔
Pig is god.
I can’t imagine how tortuous it must have been for blue when he was trapped in the piston. Forced to see and break the nether wart but always just out of reach. Plus he was unknowingly helping the witch defeat his friends. Such a clever detail. Genius
i love this detail to those of u who dont know green is a very good music/theme guy so thats why orange put a notblock on his head and this is called true friendship
And that's how Technoblade's ancestor was born
Big it Naruto
Can we just call the pig thechnoblade becuase when its the pig that has all the MCeffects he always won
MARIO PIG
The characters in these videos are always the definition of “going god mode”

トンカツやば
Why's the witch throwing potions of healing, jump boost, and luck (etc.) at Second Coming? (Also, a purple potion isn't an invisibility potion.)

TSC has got to be the best stickman fighter considering how he was able to deflect potions and hold his own. Besides he knows waaaay better than his friends about deceiving looks since he has a lot of experience with this in the past. If it wasn't for the pig, he'd be the best minecraft fighter in the series.
Pig is magic

Just to warn you because this person is getting me annoyed somebody or a company that's making stick fight games is stealing your footage and using it to promote their games especially the one where the characters are fighting the witch potion master it only appears in ads but I hope this person can stop using your footage without permission

I just saw an ad for some 'stickman vs craftman" thing and they used YOUR animation (this one) in their ad. Just thought I should say this.
I still love this episode the most. The fighting choreography is just amazing and I can't get over how well animated all of the fight scenes were. Not that it isn't well animated in the other episodes but I just love it the most in this one. Great job Alan and great job to your team as well!

I just love that red is a fish and he is still awesome at fighting
only a small thought:i think the pig was tecnoblade cuz that pig have saved them for the 2th time i think and that pig is kinda op at one ep. then he was brought back from a spawn egg and some people know his phrase that is technoblade never dies and that spawn egg is like a totem of undying for him          ik the small thought was kind of a small theory now sorry if the theory was bad😅

Es un bien video 100 likes
...I just saw an advertisement for a (presumably moderately-less-than subpar mobile) game that was stealing this video. Something with a name going along the lines of "Stickman vs. Craftman" They stole content for an advertisement and couldn't even bother to at least come up with a decent name to hide it behind.

I love this :)
The return of purple huh
0:31 I like the small detail where when the gang exit the portal and see the witch disguised as blue for the first time, they hug him in celebration. But the pig doesn't budge, because it can't smell blue's scent and knows something is up.
Its full powerrrrr
11:17  11:36

Шаринган😂😂
I love how the pig goes crazy lol
At 11:13 the pig got extra effects like "Gotta Go Fast and also Techno power!!"
When a salmon is better at pvp then you
I'm going to say it now the pig is god with potions

I just love the way that red’s pig literally turned into Technoblade to prove this when pig was drinking all of the potions it said techno power.
Lets call her super pig
The man behind the slaughter
No way...  WHILE WATCHING THIS VIDEO, I got an ad for a terrible mobile game that LEGIT stole 15 second of content from the lucky blocks episode  But it kinda makes sense, because yt knows exactly what I watch  But still...

Techno never die lol
Best fight scene ever
9:24 when the seekers find out you and all friends are hiding forever on one room
When even a llama knows to do redstone better than you:
When a fish can fight better than me with a netherite sword:

Ti's it a very epic

origin of techno
si todos los colores se enfrentan a un cerdo el cerdo gana
11:15 here is easter egg effect called "gotta go fast"
Every... vid Alan makes has so muuuuch actions 😁
Here comes the super pig again
They are surely good fighters
Red is still awsome when he still a salmon
Wait a second, why are they being all friendly with Purple? The last time they saw him, he nearly let them all plummet to their deaths for an Enderdragon Egg and he got his whole kingdom ravaged. Figured he'd be in jail or exiled or something after that, or at least that the rest of the gang would hold a grudge like SC did.
Thz super pig meme nzver get old xD  Yes im saying that 8month later and ? I cant stop rewatching this master piece
“V
This video literally made me laugh, the way the sugar cane and Fish were fighting. The Pig, was even more better.
Bro he was carrying the pig on his back red was carrying the pig on his back piggyback ride they made a pun without even saying anything
this is actually how hard it is to fight a witch lol
This time he was serious
Pig can abuse the dark lord and chosen one
this is the opst pig ever

11:16 ah yes the powerful techno power effect on the pig (right side)
**pig turns into super pig** witch: why do I hear boss music?
was there a easter egg called techno power when the pig consumed the potion
Amigo estuvo viendo por aquí en tu canal porque la primera vez que veo uno de tus vídeos y me suscribí le di Like y activa la campanita y te Mereces un premio Nobel😏
That pig just got the achievement "how did we get here"
Damn bro pig got the Mastered Ultra Instinct
Quick theory:  Since the witch turned into purple dye, and all of the other stick men turned into their dyes, what if Purple was the witch?
good pig
God I love how the Witch pretending to be blue while fighting orange had a style and movement COMPLETELY different from regular blue thats so epic.
love the little easter eggs like when you see all of the potion effects on the pig there is techno power and gotta go fast
didint know colored pencils used to exit in minecraft
This is singlehandedly the best episode yet

If you watch green playing the music block in 0.25x speed, it will found like a depressing music
Lol i saw an ad copied this video
I like the Video You Day
technoblade come in clutch
@Moonkase

the pre evolded techno blade cousion on steroids
That  bit where second was like prove it then yellow makea a contraption gold
You know what would be cool, I’m not saying this is good already, but if they all turned into iron and a pumpkin then join forces and turn into an iron golem that would be kind of cool 😎
what the pig doin
Green is cracked at minecraft pvp even when hes just a bit of sugarcane.
if pigs can fight like that pigs would be the scaries and dangurise modes in minecraft
And thats way the witch might not always be in its house
The pig is Jesus in disguise
You know that a game called Stickman fight stole your scene for there add
Im the inly one or the pig got a potion effect name " techno power" lol
Hi I like all your videos
Nico Coleman I will
TECHOBLADEE CLUTHHHHHH
3:34             *ｆｅｅｓｈ*
I'm not sure mostly because ei know nothing about fighting but I feel like the witch blue has a different fighting style?
I love how for Green as a stick figure proves himself if he’s the real green, he plays the song that he played for that one episode back near the beginning of the series
Pig god
Pig? more like goat
11:08 The return of the pig
el pescado si que sabe pelear
The video is fine I like the pig as it fights it is very crack xD I have subscribed to your channel also it is beautiful when you do minecraft animations
11:11 technoblade be like
Yes Yes yes
*witch turns yellow into a llama* "A LLAMA!? HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD!!!!"
Why techno is here
Red's pet pig going Saitama mode
This man managed to make a convincing fight scene with sugar cane, a llama and a fish. If that doesn't demonstrate how much talent he has then I don't know what would.
Me love vídeo
Ray
Pro tip: dont let red's pig near potions, or it will turn beast mode in the span of 30 seconds
words cannot describe how impressed i am with this animation. keep it up, friend!
That pig Might punch that Freakin witch
TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES! EVEN A PIG!
Haha, i did not expect that the pig will win 😂😂😂😅😅😅
11:14 , just the power of techno would be enough to deal with it.
11:20 when you get your ass kicked by a high pig.
10/24
Pig goin sicko mode
I like how TSC's way of testing if Green is the sugar cane is just to give him a note block and see if he can make *Dope Beats*
You have to be honest the witch was stronger than all the stick figures.
11:10 pues entonces que comience una batalla sin cuartel que los héroes de la tierra sepan que tiene que que hacer que las luces de mis manos me vallan a obedecer comienza la batalla ven y vence me

Why you should have pigs in Minecraft;

I love that "Gotta Go Fast" and "TechnoPower" are potion effects
I've not seen a witch that strong
Legitamate sekizo in minecraft lol
Imagine drinking so many potions and becoming so dang powerful, you literally have the power of Technoblade and even sonic. That pig for a moment, was not a simple creature, or advanced creature. That pig was a god
pig+dream+naruto= pdn
If you want to watch a minecraft series that breaks the laws of minecraft watch this man make animations that breaks the laws of minecraft
11:38 "Then I'll use my final move to  Pig series SERIUS PIG SLAP"
5:00 ngl I've seen weirder fights
Ruben in pig heaven: *My son I am so proud of you*
I like how the pig is  ultra instinct lol
if you pay attention to the point when all the effects appear on the pig, you can see two that don't exist in regular minecraft and one that's negative(maybe). Last one in the third column is Gotta Go Fast, and seventh in the last column is Techno Power, probably a reference to Technoblade, making him "never die" ba-dum-tschh. And, sixth in the second column has a symbol that looks to be Bad Omen's pillager and two axes, but most of it is covered by the pig's head. Just something I noticed.
Anyone notice the potion effect ‘Techno Power’  Edit: I just noticed one called ‘Gotta Go Fast’
pig = op
I bet red’s pet pig could have beaten the dark lord
11:17 When You Turn God Mode
If u give a Llama some red stone and pistons u get this 2:56

Is the pig Technoblade?
I have to point this out This channel is next level the fights in these are insane
wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwoooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Epik
Title: something super easy to understand, generally about 2 words long without any complexity whatsoever  Video: insane storyline with awesome fight scenes, literally dueling with sugar cane and transforming stick figures into blocks with potions that dont even exist in the game and never will, fighting salmon, battling a duel weilding diamond sword witch that is basically a final boss but 500x better, a lama that knows how to use a sword with its teeth, and a pig that just earned the "How did we get here?" enchantment and used it to blast the witch into the atmosphere like some kind of team rocket knockout    Yeah, thats basically it.
el cerdo esta chetadisimo
11:15 me after drinking the juice under the sink
Bimba top
When I looked down when the pig was powerful I saw gotta go fast :/
Epic technoblade moment
When the pig drank the potions, one of the effects was techno power
I love the pig so much. How do you think this  good Alan YOUR THE BEAST
most powerfull charather is the pig
The pig drink potions. Gets technoblade vibes.
God loves you. We are sinners and we’ve broken the Ten Commandments... but God loves us so much, He was willing to send His Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross as payment for our sins to save us from hell and gave an opportunity for us to go heaven when our life on earth is over! Jesus says in John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave us only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”! This verse means that when you put your faith in Christ, there is a place for you in heaven! So put your faith in Jesus Christ today, repent and ask for forgiveness of your sins, and may the Lord God bless you!😊❤️
Gotta go fast That has to be the funniest effect ever.
"Minecraft but i'm a fish" Pretty interesting challenge
Pig pro what

THE GOD PIG RETURNS
Kung ku pig be like
Hiin! hiin hiin hiin hiin 🧙‍♂️
Ok if the chests are bots wouldn’t it  attack the pig that is god op
i  always hate it when i get turned into a sugar cane when fighting a witch
What's interesting to me is that the main drivers of the plot and the story of this episode are:  Blue, Red, and red's pig, the three characters previously portrayed as least capable and skilled.
2:40 Wait- Yellow!  But how can I be sure?... 3:18 Yep, that's Yellow, the Redstone guru.  6:02 The torment of Tantalus  10:10  By this point I think someone has watched too many kung-fu movies; "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in particular  11:10 [Pig]: _<I remember this...>_  Orange's reluctance is understandable.
DUDE those fighting scenes are better than any anime.
Techno power yes that pig got techno power
*this pig is awesome*
Imagine, tho, if witches had polymorph or disguise potions in vanilla Minecraft, now that would be siiiiick
Pig mor like dog
Это свиья мен
11:13 Techno power is the best
11:14 TECHNO POWER???!
Man, techno got them MUI.
Pig vs witch is epic moment
Why do you add the lucky position of the game that was not see in the game in MC 🤭
This series is just the best. Like seriously. I’ve been watching these since the first few animation vs animator videos came out, and the quality has more than stayed constant, it’s slowly getting better and better, unlike so many YouTube series. Chaotic as they are, they’re chaotic in a funny, engaging, charismatic way. I’m engaged with the characters and they have so much personality even without faces or voices. I love them all 🟠🔴🟡🟢🔵🟣⚫️ And always will 🤍
Running
The entence fight with the pig:)
This is better then most anime fight scenes
Bro do I see techno power in one of the potion effects at 11:15 😆
Red's pet pig literally saved everyone multiple times throughout this series
omg Mortal combat + Minecraft + animator
The irony is, the witch should have made blue inti the dispencer. Since pistons can already break wart, but dispencers cant
THE LEGENDARY ULTRA POTION PIG IS BACK
Whaaaaaaat

Yo if I saw bamno fight back the would be crazy
Pig: dio mode
Llama, fish, pig and stick figure vs zombie
Small detail but do y’all notice that after the witch disguised as Blue throws the first potion at the Orange and Orange deflects it, there’s an “oh, crap” expression on Blue, like the witch wasn’t expecting Orange to be so skilled
First time i see a salmon fighting, i will never underestimate them now

Que épica la batalla final
Who would win? Goku or both the second coming at the end of animations vs animator and the pig with all the potions?
I love the part where Orange starts to find his friends, and I love the part where the flame attacks the witch.
An.  Minecraft animation become a dragon ball episode
The pig when red is good-calm as soon as red is.damaged and he drank the potions-YOU FOOL

in real life, when someone says something difficult to understand, i can't understand of course. But this man, oh my lord! He makes us understand everything the small stickmans are trying to say just by their movements! Always remember you're loved, Mr. Alan! Your videos are so fun to watch as a child. You always make people happy with your videos! Live long, King.
I literally just got an ad that played a scene of this exact episode  I don’t even think they got permission since it’s something called “Red Stickman Fighter Adventure” which is a heck of a long name
*TECHNOBLADE ORIGINS*  Okay but seriously this choreography and animation is actually breathtaking. I almost choked from pure *JOY* watching this

What happens when you drink every potion effect, as a pig: "The blood of the TechnoBlade god runs through you"

I love how one of the animations of the pig fighting the witch (the one where they shot up out of the portal) was the same sprite as the pig fighting one of the stick figures in episode 5 when he shot upwards with one of the figures. He has the exact same animation in punching and kicking as in episode 5.
The pig is obviously Techno
The fights are cool like anime fight
Everybody gangsta until the sugar cane starts walking, or the pig starts Kung Fu Fighting
7:39-7:51 that bamboo is so freaking sick i love it!!

How can anyone dislike this
No, wait a minute, at 10:26, if you look closely, the yellow is changed to a witch because of the witch. If you stop and look closely, the witch is from above, but the yellow underneath is filled with the potion to transform it. Why is the witch on the left (yellow) all of a sudden using a potion and fighting the orange, red, blue, and yellow?
Nice little Easter egg Alan! (Look closely at the pigs effects)
Green fighting as a sugar cane is awesome-
The pig is their ace.

green is the sugar cane.... and sugar cane look like bamboo... *vietnam war flash back*

Luke 15:11-32 New International Version The Parable of the Lost Son 11 Jesus continued: “There was a man who had two sons. 12 The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, give me my share of the estate.’ So he divided his property between them.  13 “Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living. 14 After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. 15 So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. 16 He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything.  17 “When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! 18 I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. 19 I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants.’ 20 So he got up and went to his father.  “But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.  21 “The son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’  22 “But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. 23 Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let’s have a feast and celebrate. 24 For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’ So they began to celebrate.  25 “Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. 26 So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. 27 ‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.’  28 “The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. 29 But he answered his father, ‘Look! All these years I’ve been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. 30 But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!’  31 “‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. 32 But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.’”

Found two references in 11:15: The effect “Techno Power” refers to the minecraft youtuber Technoblade, who is a god at pvp and has the skin of a pig, and “Gotta go fast” with the icon of a ring references to sonic the hedgehog.

The memories of RUBEN!
Amazing
When the pig gets all his powers, there’s 2 fake effects. One, witch is “Gotta go fast” with a ring icon is definitely a reference to sonic. The other one, is “Techno Power” with a pig icon that’s probably referencing the YouTuber “Technoblade” because his minecraft skin is a pig.
Technoblade！！！

Hello everyone,  I love our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, with all my heart and I want to tell you about him. We are all sinners who have come short of the glory of God. God cannot allow a single sin into Heaven because he is a Holy God. The punishment for sin is Hell, and we are all sinners. God does not want anyone to go to Hell. God loves us so much that he sent his only begotten son to die for our sins. His son, Jesus Christ, took on all of sin when he died on the cross for us. Jesus Christ’s blood washes away all of our sins. Believe in your heart that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead on the third day. This gift of salvation and eternal life is a free gift of God. By the grace of God, we are saved by faith alone, not of ourselves or our works.   None of us know when we will die. Accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior and getting saved allows us to have this gift of eternal life in Heaven. Repent. Put your faith in what Jesus Christ did on the cross to save you. Trust in Jesus Christ to save you. Believe in, trust, and have faith in the Gospel, the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  If you are sincere about this, say a prayer to God about it!  A couple of resources:   Check out "How to Get Saved" and "The Gospel" by Robert Breaker on YouTube, and check out "How to Get Saved and Be a REAL Bible-Believer" by Gene Kim (REAL Bible Believers) on YouTube.    Some verses from the King James Version Bible:  Romans 3:23  23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;    2 Corinthians 7:10  10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.    1 Corinthians 15:1-4  15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:    Romans 10:9-10  9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.   Acts 16:30-31  30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.   Ephesians 2:8-9  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.   Please let me know if this message has helped lead you to Jesus Christ and your salvation. Thank you for your time.

Gdushdz

Your scene is copied by a cringe ripoff ad maker
11:13 me: FLASHBACKS
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻яецшеde7reuowt
Suuuuuuper piiiiiiiiig!!!!
11:16 " super pig time 😂😂😂 "
Hey alan. Some fake stickman game is stealing your video for its ads please tell me what happened to it.
the pig is always the god of each episode.
I wish all pets could do this..
The Pig is adorable ;w;
Omg what a pig
Someone used this as an ad
_The pig is the real protagonist._
This is the bst video!!!!!!!!!!!
yellow color is chaunzy
At 11:17 technoblade was created
Like x100
The chance he had to make the sugar cane take the shape of a green Stickman has been lost
Alguien el entiende soy de Mexico
Yo you should make it so that they all wield different weapons, Green would use a bamboo stick as a staff since he showed such awesomeness using the plant as a weapon. and for the other colors i wouldn’t know. Or you can make a video where they all find their own special weapons.
Porfavor ases otro video
bro the pig just became a dragon ball z character
That pig went ham
Someone used this as an ad
And that is how technoblade was born
Imagine a witch so powerful! LMAO
That’s how techno got made
Hey I saw an ad that used the fight scene from this video forgot the name tho, I'm pretty sure the game makers stole the clip also it was a stickman fighting game
The pig again
Alan, there's an ad that stole your animation, and the animation that they steal is THIS animation

Your videos are the best
If the stickman had classes my idea would be Green with fishing rod to grapple on to buildings and enemies, Yellow with red stone to make inventions which will always come in handy, Blue with bottles and the things to make poitions to disguise and attack enemies, Orange with a crafting table to create weapons for battles and red with his pet pig to sniff anyone down.alan what do you rate this out of 10

11:25 SUPER PIG
Hola
Ah yes, the best potion effects, Gotta Go Fast and Techno Power
So uh, I did the math and that witch logically died half way through, probably drank some sort of potion to keep going, as they did quite abit of that.  ( Spoilers )                            feel free to correct my math but the point still stands: Considering the humanoid form ( or stance ) the pig takes in some scenes, I'll assume its 1 heart + 260% from Str II according to one site, which is 3.6, so that times how many hits done ( Without slow mode I counted 41ish hits ), 45 is what I counted with slow mode and I'm 100% sure I missed quite a few, but I'm sticking with it; Plug that in and we have 162, 2 points equal a heart so 81‬ DMG total, on my first search of how much HP a witch has, I got 26, which means they got over-killed by 3.115384615384615 TIMES their total HP.   This math is most likely way off but I am 100% sure that if you did it correctly, the value obtained would have been enough to render that witch *dead*, no matter the difficulty setting.  Should be noted it took like from 11:16 all the way to 11:40 and a second later to launch them ( 24-25 SEC ) for when the last punch connected: Those potion effects last 3 minutes, this pig could of done this 7-8 times over.  And Ironically this isn't the first time they were like this, so they even got experience for it too, the only difference now is there are more potion effects added than last time.      I'm loving all the little references and what not of this animation, plus I just cant stop watching the pig fight scene, love how smart the witch is- and I love how the pig ignored all of this witch's "smart" tropes, like following them into their portal to combo them as they try to make space or escape while literally throwing those potions back at them, thats one of the many weaknesses of a witch ingame, dodging their attacks or obstructions.   I see that pig made good use of their Techno-Power Potion effect, I respect that.  Cool things that I don't think were intentional but I should add: The pig = guinea pig ( Perhaps for experiments ) Their humanoid + Beast fighting style might be a sort of resonance of their Pigman form ( im not referring to piglins or Zombie pigmen/piglins ).
that pig is O P!!
Fullmetal alchimest-real end
Esse porco e virado na desgraca e a segunda vez qie ele salva ja

I love every part of this animation. From each character utilizing what they have like green was sugar cane so he used it like a staff and red was flipping in and out of the bucket. Blue and the witch used counter mobs to fight the other: snowman to blaze, wolf to skeleton. And how it used distractions to help the fight. Amazing job
First i thought friendly zombies

3:11 "so how do I know it's you?" 3:19 "...okay it's him." Also, noteworthy: 11:15, Suck My Bacon the Porcine Warrior does not appreciate your cage. Additionally, 13:43, when all your stupid friends want to do the dumb thing together, and your brain cell cannot convince them otherwise And lastly, I never really thought about it before, but I think Blue just has the passive perk of getting more crops (particularly nether wart) from everything he gathers.

hey youtube,   i just saw an ad (by ad, i mean the ads that cover up part of the video, and they have an x that can be easily blocked up by an annotation.) being blocked by an annotation. if you use more guerilla no jitzu to stop us from clicking away from ads, other people older and more important than me that also saw the guerilla no jitzu might start a riot.  this is just a reminder,   by Err0r, a part of the cool polynomers discord. (P.S. and if you're just gonna say, "WeLl We'Re JuSt ThE pLaTfOrM, tHe PeOpLe ThAt PuT aNnOtAtIoNs On ThE vIdS dO tHaT sTuFf!" so be damned, you weren't "JuSt ThE pLaTfOrM" in 2010. (or whenever you weren't a scared baby just trying not to get sued by stuff…that was a burn, by the way.) (maybe it was before susan (insert correct spelling of susan's last name here. (man, even elon wouldn't do such cruel names, and they named their kid as though it was a new super deluxe mario U Wii bros. game! (or a toaster, i can't tell.) (too many consonants together make a bad name that can't be pronounced, ok!?))) (maybe i should've used susan *radio static* …nah, couldn't fit as many insults.) was hired to YouTube, since they're putting the platform to shit.)

On 11:14, one of the potion effects said "Techno Power". What is techno power? Absorption 2 is shown twice and there is also 2 Instant health effects, Gotta Go Fast effect, and an invisibility effect that didn't make the pig invisible. What type of potions did that pig drink?
Thanks for Introducing purple

I'll be honest, I imagined a small MC character of mine (based on a minecraft skin I was interested) back a few years ago and made his lore being an expert survivalist, a creative adventurer and a smart, counterattacking fighting specialist in the world of minecraft, who is also a quite one too and what I saw from this video, was absolutely similar, (but even better than I thought), came out animated by the most creative stick animator in the world. And I say this to you Alan, thnk you for making my day awesome like this.  P.S: No stick switched to an Enderman tho...

V je v
Alan becker= man
which software used there????
Orange's family other than Alan Becker first brother 1.The Chosen One's eldest brothers 2.The Dark Lord Middle brother 3.The second coming smallest but strongest There are victim, but unfortunately he died, in the first episode, the biggest ones are actually victims.     also, the victim is the only person in this family who does not have special powers, the chosen one and the dark lord have innate powers, orange is when his friends die, that is, he gets special power from friendship, then his power goes away.
Your animation is best ....It needs lots of hardwork
I like the green boy he has power and speed

What if the witch is purple? I mean the witch is clearly having a PhD in Potions so he/she could've just made an air resistance potion! Not only is it anti-knockback, but it's slow falling too!
What if witch, but in the form of purple
I knew it was technoblade

Hello  Alan i am  From México I would like to say if you could make an animation of Undertale, Undertale is a game about two levels, that of humans and that of monsters and there are 3 options, the first is the neutral ending where you are friends with them and you kill some and the peaceful one you do not kill anyone and you are a friend of all and the last one is to kill everyone. I wish you could make an animation like that thanks alan.
Bro imagine if there was a game like this.Your work is amazing

Digger the dog gives birth we abuse puppy   4/?/2012 I remember spending a nice spring morning biting into an apple while sitting in the sun with no shirt on. Mom told me to come inside and put clothes on but I refused sitting in the sun without a shirt was just so nice and relaxing. Sadly mom stopped me and commanded me to put a shirt on. The brothers finally got up and they are watching a youtube video. I then joined them in this joyous activity. I can’t remember the next couple of hours. It was about 7:30 I was jumping on the trampoline with Dad, Stephen, and Avery  Dad. “CANNONBALL!!” I fell off the trampoline and landed on a hard concrete platform.  7/?/2012 I was playing tag outside and I shoved Stephen because he kept going for me. Mom told me to go to time out on that little pine tree. I misheard her and went in the little pine tree’s needles and I cried. I got out of time out and while I was chasing Stephen he wasn’t looking and ran into a tree.   2/15/2013 It was Stephen's birthday and we were doing a sleepover camping activity in our backyard with about 20 kids there. There was a plastic table with BBQ chips and hot dogs to roast over the fire we needed more firewood so me and Orson Dicks went and found a small log and picked it up there were carpenter ants all over it and they started to bite into our flesh Orson and me screamed and dropped the log on our feet which made us scream louder than ants started to crawl up our shorts.... it was a long day.  2/16/2013 The day after Stephen’s birthday everyone was still there, and we were playing on our swing set that was like a moving bench made of yellow plastic that weighed about 30 pounds. So on that day, I ran in front of it and it hit me. That sounds bad enough but then it grabbed my shirt and pulled me underneath it. There were about four people on it and I was being crushed while none of them got off. Eva even said  “ugg gets out, I want to move again.” I just waited there crying while Avery, a member of the crowd watching went and got Dad.   3/?/20    My brothers are getting into my journal so I'm using my favorite youtube channel to copy and paste latter

I think the schools are unfair because WHY do they want to open the schools and why are they giving bad  grades at least put a more easy way to grade but no the schools act normal if everything was ok if people havent lost their Jobs if people havent died of a virus if kids havent got depressed cause staring at a laptop for 6 hours and no seing ur friends and not going outside like man , staring at a laptop hurts my eyes and zoom after zoom after zoom gets kinda annoying .some teachers dont care about you they just give the work and they do nothing more

Alan becker where your from?
Im exited to the epsode 22
Only now am I stopping to read the pig's potion effects and noticing a few things, like water breathing being listed twice, getting effects unobtainable by potions like hero of the village, haste II twice, techno power, night vision II twice, fire resistance II (twice), luck II twice, dolphin's grace, conduit power, slow falling twice, absorption II THREE SEPERATE TIMES, levitation II, invisibility despite not being invisible, strength II twice, resistance II twice, and then right at the bottom of the third column is my personal favourite, Gotta Go Fast, with a sonic ring as the picture. Anything else I missed?
When will ep 22 be released.

Quick question, will we ever see what’s in the 5 nether portals from last time? Also, what happened with the spider king and the wither? Will our heroes return to the dolphin kingdom? I think the drowned pirates might be a problem for the dolphins and our heroes may come back to rescue them. You just have so many interesting plot hooks and I just want to see what happens with them.

Супер свинья 2:возвращение
please make a new animation
Wholsome
LOL
I have a theory on why this witch is so powerful. We can see that the background, as far as we can see, is a swamp. We know that there are many different worlds, and this one is likely an all swamp one. Because of this, at some point in the past, there would be an insane number of witches. As with any form of society, someone had to be in charge or it would all go to heck. I think that they then had a fight over who would be the ruler, and I feel that this witch, in order to win, had no choice but to think outside of the box. Instead of standard potions, she invented new ones. Instead of just throwing potions, she practiced hand-to-hand combat. The witch ended up winning, but through either overkill on her part (destroying them), or rejection on their part, although she was the winner, she ended up alone, with nothing to do but brew more potions.
This season must called the nether loop
helloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
And this, children, is why I always play the mage class.

I think the next would be Dream the Slime vs Technoblade the Pig
The most powerfull guys in the galaxy: 1.Shaggy 2.Farmer with shotgun  3.Potion power pig
These vids have a bigger plot than all of disney's movies storylines
His animation are getting better
Wait The Pig is Techno Blade...? all along?....    The game: Always have been :)
So you u guys have played around with potions, and I couldn’t help but notice that those diamond swords are unenchanted. Maybe play around with those? I think that would be pretty cool! But, this video was still amazing! The animation was beautiful and I loved the... creativity with the battles that took place.
New sub
Plot twist: These stick figures *aren’t* actually living beings and actually *are* animated by Alan and his crew (I’m assuming Alan has a team of people with him)
fun fact when the pig turned into a super pig it might be a reference to the part 4 of the avm shorts series
I really hope the pig will be a part of the colors team.

If only technoblade could see this
What if alan got the henry stickman series on his computer and the stickbros fought or helped him?
Is the pig a reference to the one time the pig drank all the potions in a previous animation?
Hey Alan! As a minecraft short idea, why don't the gang go through the nether portal into a parallel universe and they find the FEMALE versions of themselves?
The most impressive fight ( for me ) is the witch vs the green ( and the pig fight ).
Animation vs Minecraft mods Minecraft grec mitologi   Orange = Zeus Red = ares Yellow =apolo Green=Hermes Bluo= Poseidon  Purple = cronus
insanely incredible animation, great work, fish and sugarcane are best warrior
Plus Ultra pig
Jajajaa el cerdito iso mrd a la bruja XDDD
7:02 without context this is very confusing—
The pig is like if Technoblade and the Pig from the command block episode fused together
Man I’m so glad have not watched this guy in years.. glad to see he still posts this stuff ✨🥺
Why can’t you make them find netherite ?
I never knew I’d see a fitting seen like sugar cane vs witch with a diamond sword

13:35   orange: i dont want to go again   green:  come on this is fun  orange: ok but i dont trust that portal and purple
everybody gangsta till the pig starts fighting with taekwondo
If you look at the left side when the pig drinks the potions it says techno power
Remember when the pig drank a potion it wasnt supposed to drink in season 1 (the POWER potion)? well this is like MEGA POWER potion went into the pig and it defeated the witch by flinging her to the moon.
Epic...
Fun fact:the pig was the same op lvl as the other one a few years ago
GG for the pig
The pig power is awaken again LOL

I love the way the pig acts like goku
11:10 technoblade be like
I swear each time you find new and creative ways to explore the limits of our animation and it's incredible!!! It's been such an honour to watch your style develop with each new release since your very first went viral, I hope you enjoy making them as much as well all love watching them
go to 7:41 paused and see the witch's bald head. Ever since that Green was my fav character( cuz he made that hat go weeeeeee in the air)
pov : ur watching too much ads
The pig is technoblade when he was young
pig: GO BEYOND, PLUS ULTRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ho... ly... crap... that was blinking epic, thank you for this (I hate witches cuz they're hard to kill and one killed my wolf once). The last episode was an amazing tale and this one was an all out creative battle, which has inspired my imagination so thank you again.
😔
este es el mejor video del mundo
11:17
10:32 hos impostor????
I’m already used to epic stick lamb fighting ,but sugar cane,Lana,and a fish...
This reminded of episode 4.  🤣🤣
Why does this remind me of that one episode with nomu vs all might?
so thats why techno is so good at pvp
❤️❤️
Tools need enchant!!! Pls Alan.
makes animation video vs godzilla or king kong, please, i beg.
The saying technoblade never dies is true the pig did not die when having techno power
i feel like the other episode is going to be purple showing netherite to stick figures
im pretty sure the purple stickman is the witch because if you look at the dye it is purple and it doesnt change to the color of the witches skin color so im pretty sure that the purple stickman is the witch
Could you possibly make another one where they discover modded minecraft?
Techno goes brrrr
when are you going to get part 22-23
Why didn't you put The Arabic?
You this the pro crack
13:45 oh shit, here we you go again

The animation got better. The animation got better? How on earth did the animation manage to get BETTER than it already was? This series already started top notch (no pun intended), but now it has just gotten freaking legendary. And this fight choreography... holy crap, I am at a loss for words over the immense amount of complexity and creativity at play here.  Well done, absolutely amazing, can't wait to see more from you.   Btw, neat little easter eggs with the pig's effects "Gotta Go Fast" and "Techno Power"
i saw the "techno power" and "gotta go fast" effect when the pig chug down the potion

Super pig
Woow
To me the stickman gang makes a perfect five man band and here's why Leader: Orange because I mean its the main character and usually is telling the gang what to do Lancer: Green because its Oranges best friend Smart Guy: Yellow because its good with redstone and it was able to hack into the Dark Lord computer Big Guy: Red because it isn't afraid to fight someone. It wasn't afraid to fight the Dark Lord Heart: Blue because it isn't afraid to protect anyone even if it cost its life. It protected the piglin baby from being dragged in the lava while it was in the lava
This one is an...  Interesting one.  Nonetheless, it was one of my favorites?  Also Purple=Portal=Nether=Bad, so Purple is generally has bad stuff happen, although he's EPIC.

You should make an episode where they mess around with more admin items like the repeating and chain command block, the structure block, barrier block, and structure void. After they get back home, of course.

Alan you don’t know anything about Minecraft you’re making everything in this series MAKES 0 SENSE
Alan backer pls episode 13 dong 🥰🥰🥺
Everything in this doesn’t make sense there’s no a potion that will disguise you and llamas don’t build and llama and salmon don’t use swords and sugar canes don’t talk to anyone and witch don’t wield sword and there’s no potions that will turn you into a block and an item or a mob
Nice animatiom dude
Good job :)
Ah shit here we go again
everyone be simps but not orange
U are the best 🙃🙂
I want the purple be good this time

I could technically predict that Alan would make an animation about Twilight Forest, but it is quite unlikely for the moment. (Even if that would be awesome, this remains unlikely.)

I love the pig xD
Technoblade never dies!!!
fishe power
When The Pig Drank All The Potions And I Saw A Techno Ability In The Pig So The Pig Is Thecnoblade.
I guess that's why technoblade's skin is a pig
There should be an episode where they meet Dream....
Its getting better and better
wait for next episode
It's actually there friends
did anybody saw the techno power in the effects of the potion that the pig drink? That is so funny
The Second Coming at the end just looks like he's saying "Can't we just go home yet? I think we've gone through enough life-threatening situations for the past unknowable time period"
WTF. Tecno power
Wow good end
I don't like this        I LOVE IT
New member of Alan Becker's Stickmans Is it purple king??
Ah, Techno Power, that explains why the pig gets so strong.
Our boy technoblade has returned
I'm the only one who loves the fighting style of the sugar cane?
pig is the strongest animal in stick figure world.
Next idea   Enchantments
The best thing about this is that it really makes you think how different components of Minecraft would fight if they were all alive  The 7:39 fight specially
Bang kapan buat Vidio lagi

TECHNOBLADE
I like how in the end the pig just became a god
The pig just did a Mortal Combat Finishing move
I noticed some people haven't been talking about Orange's flashbacks at the end of the episode. It's showing his development as a character. He doesn't want his friends in bad situations because they could get hurt. And it's nice to see Purple again too. Maybe we can see more of his character personality.
Alan becker's fights are 10x cooler now, I love the Vcam movement
I love these pls keep up the good work, you have loads of subs
I never expected to see a shugar cane figth
Not even close baby technoblad never dies

the return of the pig who took way too many drugs
Alan absolutely nails it again. The polymorphed characters still being able to fight back, the blue stick splashing antidotes as well as the shapeshifting duel at 10:44 were absolutely perfect. Love the throwback to Ep. 4 when the pig goes berserk, but this time it beats up the witch and saves the protagonists.
Pig is techno blade which is strange but Awesome

Я один тут ничего не понимаю в комментариях?
Getting "how did we get here" be like 11:15 also cool technoblade reference
Prefect animation I like it
its official now: sugar cane for smash!!
if only witches are that tough in minecraft
11:14 if you look at the effects some are the same (like luck and luck) and some are not minecraft effects like: gotta go fast and tecno power
Wait a minute, when the pig turned the witch into a dye, it was purple dye....and the dyes seem to be the same colour as the stickmen (tsc turned into orange dye, blue turned to blue dye and so on), so purple stickman could be related to the witch... Counter argument: It could just resemble the purple clothes the witch is wearing, and purple got his redemption arc in animation vs LoL(?), and might actually be a good guy now.
What mod is this? Looks cool!
Wait kungfu pig
11:10 technoblade's backstory
wow you make a nice animation alan becker

Primero miralo y luego opinas. Que Dios los bendiga a ustedes y sus familias y si Dios quiere y si Cristo no viene antes nos volveremos a ver. Visiten el canal Casa de oración dile a un amigo ahí no verán una religión porque una religión no te va a salvar o adorar a una estatua o imagen que eso es idolatría como la virgen María o una estatua de Jesucristo sino muestran de como tener una relación con el Señor por medio de Jesucristo que eso sí te va a salvar.

THAT PIG WENT X GAMES MODE
When the pig started drinking the potions I was so sure that it would turn into a pink stick figure that I stared screaming.   Also all the stick figures stimming their arms in the end made me smile so much, it probably wasn’t supposed to be interpreted as actual stimming but as a person with ADHD who does that action all the time I couldn’t help but do it with them.
My mind:I think purple is another witch, Also my brother and me we say: he is the real purple
11:15 Me: wait... something is there Alan: yeah boiiii let's add potion effects called Techno Power and Gotta Go Fast

Prediction: The witch lands in a pillager outpost, and she tells the pillagers about the stickmen, so they all head through the portal to purple's village, the gang kill the pillagers but also get bad omen, causing purple's village to be raided.  Just a theory tho
and then it turns out that the pig was actually a pink stick figure

Anime fights in a nutshell    red fish went ham on the witch holy crap
That Fish Got Moves
The impostor was sus
简直是一部神作。
A missed opportunity there was for the witch to turn the whole gang into iron blocks except the second coming would turn into a pumpkin, then they would form an iron golem and deliver a can of whoop ass.   Not complaining, that was probably the most intense fight in the AvM series and I loved every second of it.

I like how the pig made an epic comeback since the Potion episode (Ep4, the same series). And I'm really sure Alan made the same animation where the pig kicks the witch after thr black hole effect, just like how the pig kicked Orange on ep4. And here it is again, still dominating (except the part where on ep4, after the effects ran out of time the pig turned into a porkchop LOL)
Dat fish do
They went to grab the milk
Pig with techno power: EZ
THE OP PIG IS BACK

The pig drank glowing and invisibility but it isn’t glowing or invisible :/
I thought this was a fairytale thing until I realized the llama, fish, and sugercane weren't helping Orange find his friends, they were his friends. Which really took me longer than it should have given the llama's impressive redstone skills and the sugarcane playing Green's song.
Oh no the over powered pig is back

Mega piggy is back
I like the idea of a episode based around mods. Especially moments like when you first download a mod, multiple mods, mod packs, specific packs that add certain worlds and even their own story. But also the downsides of mods, when you have too many mods, when you have those super obscure mods that literally do nothing, and especially the moment when mods get really boring. Like that moment when they get too grindy, or they remove the challenge of Minecraft to the point where it’s just too easy. The mods that make Minecraft no longer Minecraft at all, and turn it into an entirely different thing. I feel like there’s definitely something there, it would be pretty cool to see if you ever tackle this concept!
Let's just look at the "Super powers" the pig has fr
NOBODY MESS WITH THE FISH WITH A SWORD!!!!
Moments 11:14 easter egg in the affects

11:15  2 effects are  Gotta Go Fast Techno power

everybody gangsta until the bambo start walking
O porco a Ninja
Бля, это лучший аниматор, лучше просто нет, последние видио с боёвками очень крутые
I have a crazy theory. The stickmen turned into the dye of their color which means the witch was the purple stick figure trying to kill them since the witch turned into a magenta dye.
Favorite potion effects  Gotta Go Fast  TechnoPower  XDXD
Technoblades backstory
Good pig
#45 on trending! We did it!
Better than Boruto______2021
Pig ultra instic
This was BY FAR the most RIDICULOUS one! I mean,the sticks getting turned into animals (OR A PLANT IN ONE CASE) Them still being able to wield weapons and fight (EVEN THE PLANT) the increased budget for fighting 8how all swords made a flash when hitting) the Witch throwing potions like a freaking gatling gun even the callback to the superpig the first time Blue made potions!  TvTropes is gonna have a field day indexing this one!
that pig at the end was insane you really out done your self
imagine if the witch turned them into 4 iorn blocks and a pumpkin and they turned into  a iorn golem
The fish
i almost had a heart attack when i saw this in my recomended
El DIOS ADMIN SE PRESENTA 11:14

Yuo is pro

The amation just keeps getting better and keep wondering how everyone fights so good
There’s nothing like watching a Minecraft pig destroy a witch at 4 in the morning
IMAGINE HOW MUCH COOLER BREWING WOULD BE IN THIS GAME IF POTIONS LIKE THIS EXISTED?!  Potions of disguise that depending on what you brew into them changes what you become.   Potions of teleportation that can be bound to a location by say an eye of ender.   Potions of block life something that could be highly configurable!
That genjutsu tho
I love the way they identified Green. Amazing callback
11:16 looks like a main character when their theme comes on. (ps "Techno Power")
Pig for smash
I love the minecraft story mode like route you are taking.
Does anybody else realize that Green is literally breaking his body to point as the sugarcane?  Edit: and while he's fighting the witch?
Alan can you do a “Animation VS Roblox” video

Anyone want to see the pig versus  The king  in Minecraft?
Ok break down. So the pig went MASTERED ULTR INSTINCT but then purple came out of no where you know what other purple thing we saw, the purple dye the witch turned into so what if he was the witch and just Ender pearled back to the place so he can try to kill them again. But that’s just a theory, Stick theory. Thanks for reading

This confused the heck out of me at first like why are these creatures so smart, why are the blocks sentient? And then once I saw that scene of Blue in the literal void controlling a piston, that's where I was like "Ohhhhhhhh I get it now"
Super! 🐷🐖
Alan needs to rename this episdoe as "The Potion Powered Pig"
The piggy hero!
Sugar cane is op, never challenge the sugar cane
Tiembla Marvel,Disney etc
The end part just reminded me who sent the wither? It has to be spawned so someone had to it could’ve been the purple dude but like purp didn’t know they existed right? And even if he did he wouldn’t have done that he was still mad at them for the villagers going against him so who actually spawned it?

Epico
good thing pigs in minecraft cant drink potions
O único canal, mais divertido, emocionante, da hora, e tudo de bom é esse👏👏👏👏
I never thought sugar cane could be so cinematic
The fight seems blew my mind
For some reason I got really annoyed by the fact that nearly every potion is one of three: healing, regeneration, and night vision.

I thing purple its the witch
I woudl like Purple join to team
Super pig win
i JUST realized the witch turned into purple dye when the pig backfired with one of the potions the witch threw at him, which explains why we see purple out of all stick-people gathering flowers which means the witch was purple just playing around trying to get attention, *_which, A G A I N, makes sense because they entered through one of the many nether portals he left_*
'Techno power' Technoblade: finally,a worthy rival

Soo I have no idea why I'm doing this but uh So once upon a dream I had a dream where when they had gone through the portal they got separated into a world where it's pretty much a forest but not a lot of trees then orange pretty much was searching for the others then he saw red kissing a stickman then orange was gonna stop red like you probably can't kiss a dude you just met  Anyway orange was bout to stop them then another red stopped him turns out the red that stopped him was the real red red pretty much got a personality change cause for some reason it's like that in the world they're in the only way to get the normal red back was to go back to the portal and the others had a personality change too and for some reason they all had superpowers red had shape shifting abilities and for some reason orange wasn't affected by the personality change Red personality change was that he was pretty much like those tough ppl from kids movies where they care for the protagonist but is pretty cold to them The others I can't remember   Pls don't judge me
Amazing battle!!

7:54 Narutoooooo
Good story
i never seen sugar cane fight like that
What is the best weapon?  Normal people: Netherite sword  Me, and intellectual: Pig
I love this one so much!! First off, I don't know how, but the animation seems to get better each episode, like the combination of the small little details like the larger smears for the sugar cane as opposed to the brief ones for the swords, everything's just so amazing!! Secondly, I love all the callback to the previous shorts too, like with green and his music!! Also, I don't know if this one was fully intentional or not, but one of my favorite things is the dynamic between red & blue I love it so much!! Especially how in the last one red (arguably) looked the most torn up over finding out blue was missing, and how red kinda hung back with his arm around (fake) blue once they found him cuz he was happy he found him (idk I might be reading a little too much into it, but if not, I absolutely love all those little fine details) Anyways, sorry for my rant, absolutely loved this episode (could ya tell?), and props to all the animators!!
i realy love your animation
3:35 THE PARALLAX!!! Yo, Alan you're getting expensive with your minor details, aren't you?
これは面白い

Good pig!
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping everyone from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
THE RETURN OF ULTRA REUBEN!!!!!!!!!!

ULTRA INSTINT PIG
This series is epic
Able Rai...how does he do..?
This is like morph mod at Minecraft
I see Terkoiz is still active! Just not on his own.
I like all the ways the aspect of "transformation" and "living objects" were used! Plus the witch's portal but that's not the focus. The magic was especially well used during the fights, though the actual action is really easy to overlook.
GAME!!!!!
The bois: *gets turned into dye*  The pig: haha potion go bbbbbbbbbrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

Everyone in the comments talking about the pig, but nobody is showing any appreciation for Purple's excited hand movements. Or the fact that Blue, Yellow, Green, and Red all did it too. (Idk why it just makes me really happy!)
3:04 nobody: me when a homework needs a scaled model
the pig is so funny ;D
Reject humanity, obtain animal.
Witch: *almost kills the stick figures* Technoblade: So you have chosen death
in all the intense fights in Minecraft, the red pig has always been a true hero in these fights
It would be fun to see "Animation vs. Among Us". It would be like the first Animation vs. Minecraft all over again.
Imagine how good this guy would be if he Learned 3D animation

Red was evil but now is an animal person. Blue is really good at making potions. Green came can make lots of songs with note blocks. Yellow is a Redstone genius. Orange is the OG in the group unless you count red and black but there not part of the group. (Edit) I forgot purple and he/she is greedy because the villigers he treated badly and left I think it was yellow and blue just to get the ender dragon egg for him self but he may have turned good after what he/she has done i will come back in part 22 so look at the comments. If you know anything more please comment.

The third time pig is our lord and saviour
Lob
Nothing can still stop the pig
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.

Best animation Ever!❤️🔥
Wait i got an idea for the Video after they see what Purple is doing or while they are seeing what Purps is doing you can introduce Netherite to them so it starts with either them watching something or just leaving for their portal when they see a creeper in the Nether that had walked through they run up to it with a Trident with Channeling and it turns into a Charged creeper then before it blows up Yellow hits it away and then runs away to the others and when the Creeper blows up it reveals some  Ancient Debris, they then mine it with their Diamond picks: when they pick it up they afterwards rush to your computer and then look it up on google what it is and its uses so they devise a plan where Yellow stays behind to smelt it while the others go mining, afterward it has been a while since they started and they have been mining a lot of Ancient Debris BUT they then encounter a new kind of mob (of your choosing Alan) comes and it is obsessed with Ancient Debris so it attacks them while they were mining and it is hard to fight and they all get Captured but since they made quck trips back to give Yellow the Debris they mined yellow comes in and sees that they are nowhere to be found Yellow gets worried and rushes around and finds all the Biomes before they find the Bastion and sneak in where they see Red, Blue, Green and Orange hanging in cages above the Lava that spawns with it Yellow manages to save them and give them a few bits of Armor and Tools made of Netherite and there is a Big Battle and one of them gets taken hostage but then the Piglin's from the Netherwart episode comes see's that they are in trouble and shoot the Netherite hoarder with one of their Crossbows the Hoarder gets distracted by them and whoever got taken Hostage(i vote Red for that) escapes while the Hoarder is distracted and all 5 of them start to join in with the battle unfortunately only 2 adult piglin's and the Baby Piglin survived but they join together to get over Piglin's from the bastion and the Brutes to fight him while the Stickfigures distract the Hoarder and then it would be the Entire Bation v the Hoarder he is taken down by knocking him in the Lava and all remains are his 2 Netherite swords and his full Netherite armor with they give to the Piglin's so they can make more after informing them it is underground and then the Stickfigures go back home and you Alan can choose what they will do since i hae said enough  (also if this gets likes from people who may like the story i made for an episode it makes it so it's more likely to be seen by Alan so if you liked it could you please hit the thumbs up if not just comment if you didnt and dislike i dont mind so hope you enjoyed and maybe if it is able to become an episode (i hope its a possibility) i wrote all in one sitting and bye)

Animation is good.
Man, I remember watching the first “Animation VCS animator” video so many years ago. It was a few months old and I just got out of school for the week and so happen to start watching random stuff, mainly stickfigure stuff and it just popped up one day.   I’m so godamn proud and happy to see you all these years later improving each animation each and every day. I’m glad to see how much you’ve grown and how humble you always are.   Thank you Alan, and thank you to all his animators!
for this I pay the internet XD
2 Days Ago = 5.3 million views  Damn dude congrats 🎉🎊🍾🎈

Holy god this is awesome! I love the movements of them!

AvM Shorts video idea: Name: Update  All the stickmans were walking around their house on the desktop and everyone was bored by having nothing to do, everything they had to discover in Minecraft has already been discovered, so the Chosen One decides to explore the computer in search of something to end boredom , he ends up entering the settings and finds the resolution, as he doesn't know what a resolution is, he ends up messing with the configuration and ends up expanding the Desktop, revealing a huge Minecraft world, and right next to their house they discover a mountain then they decide to go on an adventure, climb the mountain! After much suffering, the red reaches the mountain first then he finds a mysterious creature, the goat, as it is a new animal for him, he decides to domesticate the goat, and he succeeds, only when the others arrive together at the top of the mountain, the goat gets scared and ends up pushing everyone, except the red one, and everyone else ends up falling at the Lush Caves, the red one jumps off the mountain to help them (making a mlg), and arrives at the Lush Caves too, so the blue is fascinated with the amount of flora that has in that cave, and red ends up discovering another creature, Axolotl...  From that moment on I had no more ideas, but they will probably have replies with wonderful ideas (Sorry for any grammar mistakes, I'm using a translator to write all this)
I wish potions were like this in Minecraft

Mr.Pig was awesome!
Orange must've been like in the ending:  Ah sh** here we go again
anyone else see the Techno Power effect when the pig drank the potions
11:10 How it feels to chew 5 gums
11:14 The effects of the potions that the pig drank are repeated, and some are the same but with a different emoticon from the potion, I realized that since there are not so many good potions. And hero of Village it's no a ption ._.
technoblade cameo ???
Wait a second... did I just see "Techno Power" as a potion trait (idk)??? I mean I get it it's a pig and all but like-
Techonoblade never dies when he drinks a portion

11:14 OP PIG IS BACK
Piggy saves the day
Ohhh its so cool....i like the super plant heheh
I think purple is the witch cuz when the stickmen got turned into dyes, the dyes were their exact color, and when the witch was turned into a dye the dye was purple, and all of the sudden we see purple pop out of nowhere, but this is only something I noticed watching this video so it’s highly unlikely that this is true, again, it was just an observation
TECHNOBLADE pog
Очень странное и смешное видео и одновременно ипичное
Imagine if Dream showed up and destroyed the witch
I miss the drunk pig
love it!
Super Pig
Id say Bro You Out Dun your Self But That last Punch The PIg DID Just Killed me Fr After That I Just Died I Fr Could Not  Stop Rewinding TO that Point and watching it Over And Over And Over Thx Man This Made my Day Bro Just Amazing 10000000000/10 xD Thx For the Best Animation in a long time     -Ano

THE PIG GOD HAS SUMMON!!!
The winner is mr. Piggy
When the pig drinks all the poison,the pig like technoblade
11:15 Technoblade in his true form.
Going with purple is 100% a trap. The witch turned into purple dye. Same as the other sticks when hit with that potion. Not safe.
Wait if the evil gamer turned into a purple dye...   does that mean he’s purple stick guy? ... Nah, probably not.
Flaaaaash back ...................    NOOO IM NO BACK PORTAL

The fact that the sugar cane is also alive and can smell is pretty cursed, and killing a witch in Minecraft is honestly not that hard unless the witch has good skills.  P. S. The fight coreography is pretty epic.

You've done it again!
The Mad Pig return!!?
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Jajjajajaj 😁😃😃😃😃😁😁😁😁😁 11:16

I'm making a bet: the next episode may very well be about purple's [revamped] village getting raided by the illagers (and maybe even the witch in this episode will make another appearance).  Edit: I was wrong, but that's a-ok in my books.

Questions for you Alan: Does The Second Coming remember his powers? Or was that story separate from the others? Will his powers make a small appearance in any of the other animations?  If Alan has answered these questions before, can someone fill me in? I'm not 100% in tune with everything that goes on. I'm pretty much here for the animations. Anyway, great job Alan and Allies! Keep up the absolutely amazing work.

11:15 when you dont realise theres technopower in right bottom, gotta go fast at the bottom, and double instant health(also its illegal if it is one),,,,,,, and you realise them when somebody said it.(also theres two of haste, water breathing, slow falling) (and....... theres also both of them with different symbol,,,, speed, strength, resistance, absorption, fire resistance, luck, jump boost, night vision.... and glowing with invisibility..... and MAYBE bad omen(at the pigs mouth MAYBE) with hero of the Village.)
Handsdown, The sugarcane fight was the best
Anyone else remember a while back when the pig drank a lot of potions and became really strong?

SUPER PIG HAS RETURNED
Amazing now a fish can fight.
Kevin Feige has confirmed the unfortunate rumor that many of us Marvel fans have been dreading. The shot callers at Marvel Studios have elected not to find a worthy thespian to embody the coveted role of T’Challa and pick up where the late, great Chadwick Boseman left off. Black Panther II and the cinematic future of one of our most beloved superheroes have been intentionally derailed. T'Challa needed to be recast, not sacrificed to prop up an objectively inferior successor. Second-rate allocation ain't supposed to be the name of the game. It is unforgivable for Marvel Studios to cave to the BS idea that an actor's real life journey should determine the ultimate fate of a universally recognized fictional character. Rest in peace, Sir Chadwick, but that particular creative decision is indefensible and asinine. This is not the way to honor Mr. Boseman, nor the immortal Black Panther legacy. King T’Challa predates Chad’s memorable portrayal by a whopping 50 years of firmly established comic book history and glory. No matter what happens to an actor, fictional icons must be permitted to march ever forward with pride, not blacklisted from the silver screen and silenced indefinitely. Simply unacceptable. May this be a teachable moment for these so-called Hollywood heavyweights. They damn well better put some respek on his name. T'Challa was, is, and always will be the one true King of Wakanda. Accept no substitutes. POINT BLANK PERIOD.
The pig eye glowed is the pig sans WANNA HAVE A OINK TIME REEEEE

I wish YouTube still had community generated captions. They made these videos so much better.
Muito top  😃
I hope in the next episode we see Purple's redemption arc where he becomes an honorary member of the gang  I'd be sad to see him backstab the gang or use them for his own benefit
God big
Bro, when the fish starting sword fighting I fucking lost it
When the pig drank the potion that gave him all the effects, it said on the background that he had invisibility, so why could he be seen
Wow that pig is DUCKING INCREDIBLE!!!!
The god pig returns
me nos mal  ya sali el ep 21 de esta serie el ep 22 saldra en marzo
How... The fish.... What
Orange and the whole gang in front of witcher house be like:  Witcher: Oh, you are apronching me? Rather than run in fear, you are coming right in my direction?  Orange: We can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer.  Witcher: HO HO! *Picks up a potion* then come as closer as you like.
Ah yes Super Pig is back.

this is so amazing i wish there were advanced animations like that in minecraft
Piggy went Ultra Instinct on that witch 🤯
E
Techno pig power full
Technopig powerfull
Could this be canon that the pig is actually a reincarnation of the pig from Ep 4 because the pig knows too well how to use all the potions to his advantage. And also, it had the same trigger effect with the potion affects going down a list. But that's just a theory. A GAM-
wait... so the witch got turned into purple dye all of the sticks were turned into thier respective dyes... so... is the witch purple?
Cara vc e o melhor
Imagine fighting with a salmon.
error the pig did not appear when they throw the potion to the chests
The godly pig is back XD

This is the most epic battle I've ever seen 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Can we just admire how they can still kick some but without being stick figures and super pig came back

Dear Alan Becker, do you allow users in China to reprint your videos or allow them to create them again?There is a user named "豆豆火柴人" on Chinese Tik Tok who secretly stole your videos and used robots to dub videos to get money. He said that this series of works were created by him. I would like to ask whether you authorize him to reprint these series of videos              -----(Machine flip)

Nature magazine recently published its list of the ten most influential scientists of the year. One of them is Professor Wendy Rogers of Clinical Ethics at Macquarie University of Australia.  Professor Rogers started paying attention to transplantation ethics in 2015 after watching the documentary Hard to Believe. The following year, she became the chair of a nonprofit organization International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC).  She led a team to review research papers published by Chinese transplant doctors. She believed the team’s findings, which were published in February 2019, would curb forced organ transplants in China.  Nature cited that a group of international experts had drawn the same conclusion as Professor Rogers. The group, led by Sir Geoffrey Nice, an attorney experienced in prosecuting war criminals, published a paper that questioned the Chinese communist regime’s reported number of transplants and concluded that more prisoners of conscience had their vital organs forcibly taken and that the crime is very likely ongoing.  Under former Party chief Jiang Zemin, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) launched a nationwide persecution of Falun Gong in July 1999. It established the 610 Office, an extralegal institution whose sole function was to eradicate Falun Gong, under directives to “ruin [practitioners’] reputation, bankrupt them financially, and destroy them physically.”  Since then, more than 4,300 practitioners are confirmed to have died as a direct result of persecution, and untold numbers have been imprisoned, tortured, subjected to brainwashing and forced labor, and even had their organs taken and sold for transplantation.  The communist regime utilized all state agencies to persecute Falun Gong and implemented a policy of “[counting] all deaths of Falun Gong practitioners as suicides” and “to cremate their bodies without documenting their identities.”  Many jailed practitioners underwent frequent blood tests and other physical tests in prisons and forced labor camps. At the same time, a large number of practitioners disappeared.

TECHNOBLADE
Can you give a subtitles your videos
Orange: I wanna be a Disney Princess but with no singing, but with a buttload of sword fighting. And also Minecraft. Alan Becker, with zero hesitation: Consider it done.
For those who disliked this video, give me one SOLID reason why. I'll wait. 😎🍿
I mean potion video
Alan the ninja pig was cool
Stickman:   Pig:TECNOBLADE NEVER DIES
I remember power pig in your last video
11:15 I can only assume what "technopower" effect means
to be honest Alan. I was confused with this episode.
The zombie fight scene 😩👌✨
I am also an animator but i dont have a team to animate
Starting from computer icons, Alan is a master of creating elaborate fights with random objects!
This is probably how minecraft looks to people playin drunk
When the imposter is sus
Perfectoooo
domuz sahnesini bir yerden hatırlıyom ama...
EPIC!
And this is how Techno saved the day.
Pls alan becker look my channel plss
This is much better than Netflix
9:50 shing sounds like the ninja kiwi one and that makes me sad with flash dying and all
I think there should be a episode about enchanting their weapons where one of them finds an enchantment table
The piston is blue
The anime fight is back...
A simple life that Orange wants is a life where he trades with the villagers, he wants a life to play with his friends, but his friends don't ask what he wants.
11:14 The pig with super power is back
Fuck!!! This is amazing!!! :D
7:41 bamboo power

Alan Becker, you are the best animator I have seen, like pencilmation, you make very incredible animations, by the way I recommend you to see the glitchtale series, it is one of the best series created by an undertale fan that I have seen in my entire life , ¡I wish you the best of luck in your next job, along with pencilmation and camila cuevas (who is the creator of glitchtale) are the best animators I've ever seen in my life, keep up the good work!

...amazing
yo was that technobloade
waw its ,  cool
14:09 A sheet here we go again.
so what if purple was the witch? now i dont remember much about purple so im not sure if their character would actually do that, but think about it. the other stick figures turned into their color of dye when they got turned into dye. the witch turned into purple dye. and as for turning back into the stick figure version and getting back, its been shown that the dyes can use items (or atleast drink potions), and that you can easily hide stuff on your character, so they probably had some potions left over. but its just a theory. sorry for long comment. i dont really do these
the pig is good
The pug went ultra instict
豚強。豚も魚も何もかもが強い。

pig thenoblate power
The Witch has infinite supplies for potion making and has fighting skill that made the stick figures feel outmatched.  Pig can drink potion that gives him super powers (Techno Powers that is said in the comments) which also happens in the previous episode where Blue first learned Potion Brewing.  If this ever happen in Minecraft. . .  . . . please nerf or else we're doomed. 0.0

👁👁👁👄👄👄👁👁👁
7:39 EPIC!!! AMAZING! SENSATIONAL! WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT A BLOCK OF LAND WHIT SUGAR CANE COULD DUEL WITH A SHIN SWORD WITCH. ALAN IS THE MASTER OF ANIMATIONS!  MAY THE SEA ALING! BECAUSE WE WERE MEGA PIG BACK!!!

Odio ser el unico español
Oh no op pig again

El regreso del super Puerco que buenisimo regreso
the magnificent SUPER PIG
pig comes in clutch
Pig went epic gamer mode and image if there was an mutated sugar cane in minecraft that would be epic
2nd time the pig saved them. 1st time the pig loses
Wow. These fight scenes get more complex and amazing to watch by the episode! I love how each different morph has a unique fighting style — the fish is bouncy, flowy, and able to attack from off-angles due to being a featherweight while the sugar cane is lightning-fast and versatile, able to mount a blistering offense with its extendable shoots and unique weaponry. And the scene where the witch brings minions to help in the fight? Stunning. I look forward to watching this video again and again in the future!
11:13 I like how the first thing i saw from that entire list was 1 of the 2 only buff that isn't in the game itself
* damn... didn't knew technoblade was in this video..  * TECHNO POWER!.
Tercera parte y me suscribo y en esta que muera amarillo
Who would ever dislike his videos?
I love it but where is pink?
It's really amazing!!! The effort you put into each video is admirable! they are beautiful!! there are no words 💖👌✨
When you can not defeat your enemy, the Pig takes care of your enemy.

professional pig
Mn muito top

11:16 goku pig

Yeah!!
I’m more scared of the pig than the dark lord AND the chosen one put together
PEPE
This is my favorite one so far. The objects animated as people. The crazy fight with multiple transformations succeeding at max speed, ultimate pig saving the day. A masterpiece
yooooooooooooooy
The pig is supposed to be invisible... Anyway very good fight scene!
Oh so green could walk ??? So then why was he being carried?????!!!!
11:10 Ah shit, here we go again.
This episode reminds me a game of the Nintendo DS, in that game you control a lot of different objects. Awesome job Alan :D
WDF🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
E
Alan the animation fights tho...
Yes, its the super satin pig again.
THAT WAS SO GOOD I didn't expect that coming with the pig drinking all the potions again to send the witch flying 🤣 😍.
I'm too lazy to rewatch the old episodes again, so can somebody tell my something about the last episodes with purple? I remember only that he was a mad villager king or something and they fighted the ender dragon, but purple betrayed them... so how it ended?
I'm not gonna lie on my experience this is the best one yet  I'm definitely saving this one
Top ten best anime battles  Pig vs witch

As soon as I saw the pig drinking the potions I knew how the witch was losing. Even the stick boys couldn't beat the potion pig, they just got lucky that it wore off before the pig killed them.
11:21 - 11:40 *insert intense anime music*
Alan Becker: 🤯
this episode didn't even try to make sense lol

Imagine Minecraft added potion for pigs lol

Yah ok mr. Lol
The pig XD
I saw “Techno Power” in that list of potion effects  TECHNOPIG CONFIRMED
and thats how technoblade was created
Sorry but none of these potion effects helped the pig  Except Techno Power, that's what fueled him

Can everyone visit black stick figure and purple can meet the other red stick figure.Because one I don’t think the other red is dead and two they can all be friends! I’m sure the other red realizes his mistake.

AYYY ITS BEEN AWHILE
I think that purple was the witch because when the witch got transformed it turned into PURPLE dye. Also, what are the odds purple and the others would be at the same place at the same time. 🤨
lol I like the easter eggs "gotta go fast" and "techno power" as potion effects at 11:16
imagine if lamas are actually that smart  in Minecraft
They don’t speak but we always understand them. He makes these animations so interesting.

I’m a big fan :D
The pig is all ways at it and I love it it’s 😂
Why the f. are there 1300 people disliking this? It's huge work, it's funny, it's well made, the stories are compelling, and the author has been there for at least 5 decades.  Who the hell is so entitled they found something to dislike in this instead of just not watching?

Amazing! Just like always!
Foda muito bom
after a 1 month without video you came back .. Master of animation
I hope the pig turns out to be a 6th pink stickman, which would explain why it can move and fight like the others when on potion effects. Could tie in with purple's story as well.
11:40 TEAM ROCKET BLASTED OFF AGAIN

How is it that each one of these is just so creative and new even though it’s all pulling from the same source material? I think this both shows how deep Minecraft is, and how incredible these animators are.
This has to be the most delightful, entertaining piece of storytelling I have ever seen. This was SO much fun to watch! Thank you for all of your hard work, Alan!
And also you should create more character
I hope that purple decides to stat with you and the others

Wow
This video got me to shed a tear. Not because I'm sad, but because I'm not used to watching videos that perform the basic function of making me feel some semblance of an emotional shift. This video continually surprised and excited me with action that struck the perfect balance between being visually digestable and fast enough to make for an exciting fight. I loved every twist and turn the story took, and every time I thought the video was about to end it just got two times more exciting until I eventually just had to accept that the video wouldn't be over until I was satisfied.   Alan Becker (and all the other awesome people involved) thank you so much for making these videos. They inspire me to improve myself as a game designer and story teller. I really appreciate your existence.
Hahaha hahaha  same portals
Ураааа, новая часть🥰🥰🥰
Good YT, nice video Like

One of the pig effects was techno power that is awesome
Bruh "techno power"
holy shi* the pig has ultimate power
Al fin lo estaba esperando tanto :D
I still remember the pig getting bunch of potion effects lol.
Is the next video going to be the villager& pillager
Imagine if witches actually fought like that, dodging and blocking attacks, throwing a tonne of potions everywhere in your direction, turning people into objects and animals, literally making objects fight for them, and literally disguising themselves.  That would be one very difficult boss.
Cool
You could say that blue is the imposter
that it was with the pig at the end you can't see it entering the portal :v
Bruh one of the potion effects on the pig was Techno Power let's goo
1 mes de espera vale a pena
You finally Upload ep 21
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9. That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.

It seems these stickmen have Technoblade as a pet, because there is no other explanation how does this pig become so destructive after drinking a lot of potions. Edit: I just noticed that at 11:15 there is “Gotta go fast” and “Techno power” effects.

Pig: Alright, I got three minutes worth of ass kicking to deliver, and I only need a minute and a half.
your animatios wow
I am amazed on how a sugarcane vs witch fight is so much better than any of the star war sequel battles.
Why is Alan so obsessed with SUPA PIG! (probably because DJ likes it.)
Se imaginan que smash Bros colaborará con el , sería brutal amigo
👊👊👍
good pig
The witch turned into the sky.     Got punched by the super pig. Genius
The quality on this episode is over the top. The fight choreography, the animation, gestures, everything! Edit: I forgot to mention the plot, specially the piston "soul" part.
I never knew pistons were so complex
Okay, NOW this is what you call epic.
SUPER PIG: THE RETURN
11:15 flashbacks to episode 4

Each time it just gets better and better! Seriously, every animation Alex puts out is 10x better than the last. The choreography in this one was just stunning, especially with the stick figures constantly switching from item to block to creature.

The drunk pig is BACK
Amazing episode
11:16 *technoblade be like*
If someone were to tell me that some of the most creative fight choreography was from a stickman + minecraft animation, I wouldn't know what to say. But now I believe it. You somehow manage to make each episode extremely unique and have its own personality. Great work as usual!
It’s always the pig that saves the day

Ese cerdo está mamadisimo
Hey alan I have a idea maybe when the mighty 5 stickfigures are chilling in purples world purple can show orange blue green yellow red her portal room where she can switch dimensions like from minecraft to fortnite and from fortnite to among us
Never did I think I would see such high level fighting from a salmon and llama on youtube other than Mrfudgemonkeyz, im impressed lol
That pig just uses cheap fighting combos
Only Alan can make it reasonable for a fish and a Llama to hold a sword in a fight.
*PIG IS SONIC
If you see in the end how they go in the portal with purple the pig disapir
I wish you could become friends with mobs like this. Sugar Cane fighting a witch. THE PIG IS THE CHOSEN ONE!
Copied from reaction video because engagement helps  I wasn’t sure how you were going to make witches interesting, but holy cow the transmutation potions were so cool to watch!! The action, the terror of being inanimate objects like the sugar cane or piston, the return of potion pig, the lowkey portal PTSD in SC, and the ACTION!!! So fun to watch!!
I love this animation! awesome work! :D
Orange just gives off such a strong, "Yup, same crap as always," energy in these. And Green is a boss fighter no matter his *ahem* condition.
This is now my best episode afterall
Imagine witches actually being this op in minecraft lul
Everyone gangster till the pig starts drinking potions

That pig became techoblade ahhahahaha lol
11:15  *TechnoPower* LOL
pig is best character
I'm aware this is an obvious detail, but I'm just a fan of the fact that there's actual development, y'know? Characters are learning from their mistakes and making realistic decisions - or at least that's what's beginning to happen. That paired with the genuinely astounding animation and you have yourself an amazing, _free_ animated series that never seems to get dry. Keep it up, Alan, this stuff is historic.
Not the super pig again
I have only one question  What?
The pig transform into ultra
Purple will remember that...
Prop hunt
11:16 on the right        *Techno Power*
This is the most MLG witch I have ever seen
I love you call them shorts yet the fights are better and longer than most in other animated shows

Pig has Strength, speed, absorption, resistance, health boost, saturation, instant health, slow falling, strength again, hero of the village, regeneration, fire resistance, jump boost, night vision, luck, something, haste, water breathing, invisibility, levitation, glowing, speed again, haste again, instant health again, fire resistance again, something, something, absorption again, resistance again, *gotta go fast* , absorption again, slow falling again, water breathing again, dolphin’s grace, conduit power, jump boost again, *TECHNO POWER* , fire resistance again, night vision again, and finally, luck again.
11:15 it says techno power as a potion effect
What we learn today? Tecnoblade destroy everyone Also: why the pig have the gotta go fast effect?

The return of rueben the super pig
gotta go fast and techno power huh
RETURN OF THE SUPERPIG!!
oh, I've been following your work for a long time and I'm wondering if there will be Stickmen vs undertale animation?
Why does a pig always save the day
I think purple was the which. I mean what else was he doing. And if the which could brew potions that turn people into blocks or mobs then who’s to say that purple didn’t start brewing and turned into a which. Plus we see the which got turned into a purple dye and get kicked to the left and the forest where we find purple. I think that after he was deposed he was banished from his kingdom and sent to the forests where he learned to brew potions and transformed into a which but when he found blue he decided to get revenge against him for ruining his life. And in next video we will see him transform into the which.
haha the pig just become technoblade
Yeah, I am simp      S U P E R P I G
at 13:29 pig goes after red an yellow, but in the next scene, at 13:40, pig is not there...

This has to be the best AvM short yet, like, a fucking sword fight between a witch and a bundle of Sugar Cane?! And the rapid transformations when Blue and Thw Witch had a 1v1, and the callback to the first potion episode, like fuck this is genuinely amazing
I just realized that pig is a freaking saver

What the heck goes on in Alan Becker’s mind. I can tell ya! Pure perfection.
animation very fast
Am I the only one who was confused at the start, but thought things would get less confusing later on, but instead got even more confused at the end?
The pig is a god
I like the fact that in the potions effects appears Technopower
ooooo
Is very very awesome your work with mc animations ❤️
Lhama with a sword? S W E E T

Legit one of the potion effects said techno power, so that pig is the true god
11:17 epict moment
Never thought i'd see a piston, a lhama, a fish, a bamboo and a pig fighting a witch, at least on this channel... Man, this is getting crazier
Funny how we see orange go through the flashback from like the latest year. It's kinda like we've been with the characters all this time. Like a true adventure ...
11:17 One punch pig XD
11:15 wait reference I remember that
Techno Blade Origin Story
Love uu
...Well this is the coolest thing I've seen today honestly. That was an AWESOME FIGHT SCENE! I really liked how Red fought with a sword... as a fish... SWORD FISH! Also green being sugar cane and kicking some serious ass... nobody can deny out awesome that sequence was. This, overall, is pretty high quality.
YOUR BACK!
How we See Technoblade: Depressed Pig man  How those who played in Minecraft Monday See Technoblade: 11:11

JESUS THE PIG JUST WENT LIKE 💥
The piggie is the third coming who has saved our heroes  See 11:08
Bruja
I don't know which mob I would rather have added to Minecraft more: a super witch that can transform, or a fish on the back of a llama where both animals can wield swords.  Actually, on second thought, I want pigs to turn into gods if you use every kind of splash potion on them
This video is Awsome I love it you are the best at animation and thats finale your the best!
Fish is swords man of the year
7:02 Now thats worthy right there!!
Man, witch vs sugar cane was insane

THE FISH HAD A SWORD!
wonder how the zombie did not burn
Lol at first i thought the zombie betrayed orange turns out the witch switched bodies with the zombie and turnded him into a sugar cane
11:15 Gotta go fast potion effect

Techno Power Bottom text
Fighting scenes are op
Amazing concept
Me confusing why Lamas is in that biom.
The ultimate pig has returned.
This not getting any wierder than this.. *pig start drinking potion* Ok nevermind
Huh, lil detail I noticed. One of the potion effects that the pig had was called Techno Power, which I'm guessing is a reference to Technoblade?
The Stickman Gang finds a Zombie that joins their team Followed by a Llama who decides to tag along. Then a pig comes along and decides to join Followed by a red wool block. Then comes along Waxed Lightly Weathered Cut Copper stairs-
I'm sorry, but DID THE PIG DRINK A KUNG FU POTION OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THE WITCH GOT DESTROYED!
MR OINKS IS BACK!!!

This YouTuber has the mind of true talent and creativity. Mojang needs to hire this person for his Minecraft company. Alan Becker truly deserves praise for his inspiration to a ton of Minecraft fans out there watching these videos.
I think purple is the wit h in disgui
Is it weird that purple hugged the other secondary colors, hmmm think about that, but it’s probably nothing
11:39 it would be more satisfied if the pig just eat it
That pig just got “how did we get here”
только свинья может одолеть величайшее зло во всем мире... СЛАВА УКРАИНЕ

Pause at 11:15 to see the Potion Effects.  “Techno Power” and “Gotta Go Fast” are in the far right bottom.
Creo que soy la única que habla español no sabe inglés y mira estos vídeos

11:12 pig fight scene.
When you realize nothing can cook the bacon
4:58 the hollow fish(because it is hitting down with the sword)  Also,the potion that transforms someone in another thing is fake like the one that made a portal appear but they look extremely real in this animation,if someone that dont know so much about minecraft see this  he/she would probably think that it's real because it is extremely good animated
you are the best!

Out of all the effects that pig gained, techno power alone would have been enough to defeat any foe.
Since the Pig will now be a honorary member of the stickman family,  How will we call him? (Pig or MC Pig)

Super Saiyan Pig.
Yo, this episode was by far the most creative. The way all the characters are fighting by utilizing their different entity forms was so interesting and the fact that you still made it so fast-paced was amazing! You had me rolling when Green started fighting as actual sugar cane. This series definitely just gets better as it goes on.
alan becker you are best animator in this year I love watching you animation videos you make me so happy and Im the stick figure lover too keep going alan becker you are doing great good luck and see you in next video 😇😁😄😉😙🤗
Man, I really loved this episode, especially for its diversity in its combat.
Yeeeee ! New vid

LMAO THE PIG HAD A POTION EFFECT CALLED “TECHNO POWER”
But then again there was a God pig, a "sword"fish, and fighting lama

The pig has become one punch man

Death battle episode: Goku vs the pig from Alan Becker
* Sees TechnoPower in powerup bar for pig * Well, that witch has no chance now   I wonder what techno would think about this series. He really likes all the artists in the fandom of the dream smp, but I can't imagine how anyone would dislike this series...welp now I have brainrot of techno knowing about this series...I like to think he would be as amazed with the series as the rest of us
11:15 GUYS *TECHNO POWER* (rightmost column lol) (Why is nobody talking about that it had me DYING)
Goddd bro
YES
Sad purble finally they follow him
11:08 *ultra instinct music plays*
Those sounds are so crispy
Go Russia subtitle
El cerdo esta en su máximo poder
After i see ep 20 and this episode i have some ideas:  If you can ride a pig because not a hoglin too, if there is armor for a horse why not pigs could be a litle buddy, like wolf but you can ride and have armor
That sugar cane was op
Awesome
11:39 Go beyond... PLUS... ULTRA!!!
Animation vs Minecraft Manhunt would be awesome!
Really well made
Techno power🤣🤣🤣
Did anyone hear the slight OH when blue upper cut the witch
How thas the fish learns to sword fight
No one could make minecraft fights look this cool aside from this legend
Ou yeah
4444/4444
Next video in two monts later
this is some good anime
techno power should be a real effect
Terkoiz in the credits???
I really like Alan Becker's Minecraft animations because they are not the cringy "Monster school bottle flip among us Funny compilation" type of videos.
OINK!
Techno power lol
everyone has made art today except Alan ,Alan has made a masterpiece
Alan did you now super pig what you made in one old video  whel heres now
When a salmon has better pvp skills then you ever will
The best video I have watched on youtube
Witch: Muhahaha now you all are dead  Pig: Techno never dies
Now this is why i hate witches
epic pig
did anyone notice that the video ends exacly 3 minutes after the pig drank the god potion?
PIGS ARE THE MOST POWERFULLLLL
11:15 I saw that techno power XD What if the pig becomes a Canon character and becomes technoblade just an idea
Siiiiii vuelve el mejor personaje el cerdo mamadisimo
Alright another new vid, this one got me pumped I almost thought it was an imposter from amoung us
Do you need to get your characters to meet up with the guy who made Henry Stickman now that would be something to see
I'll never kill a pig in mc ever again
imagine walking up to a swamp and seeing naturally spawning llamas, an air-breathing salmon that doesn't flop around, a witch that can open up literal time vortexes, and a moving sugarcane.     techno power enchantment? ALAN'S A TECHNO SIMP
An epic fight as always 11:17
Did anyone else notice that the pig didn’t go through the portal with them? I think it could have been an animation error, since the pig walks back to the portal with them, but just isn’t there in the next shot.
OHMYGOSH THIS LOOKS SOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD my compliments to everyone who made this.
2:17 Llamas in a swamp What??
Me at 3 am: *watching a random bamboo shoot fighting a witch
"techno power" lmao
Holy shit the choreography
The ANIMATION!!! Ya'll outdid yourselves again from the fight choreographies to the story board as a whole. That 5 vs 1(or 5 vs 5 if you include the chests and brewing stands?) was so sick. And that Sugar Cane vs Witch sequence was absolutely AMAZING. Seriously it left me mind blown! Then of course Reuben with that All Might punch. Seriously, amazing job you guys.
The amount of creativity is immensely incredible
Dose anyone notice how one says techno power on the right side at 11:15
Gerald the pig in 0.1% of his power: 11:18
the fights in these videos tend to be a bit,, busy thats not a good or bad thing, i know its inherent to the stick fighting genere, if anything, it adds to the replay value, and adds a lot of spectacle to the videos. but theres just too much, and i know that sounds like a non argument, but it’s hard to focus on all the cool stuff in the fights when there’s 4 different sources of action on screen at once. a step in the right direction is the slow mo, it keeps the fast pace of the fights in check, and makes memorable moments. 10:38 look at that, that was badass, because 1v1s compress the action into a more easy to digest way, no matter the fast and busy the fight is
The power of the sugar!!! of the sugarcane
YES YOU FINALLY POSTED AGAIN
7:40 Damn that sugarcane martial arts lookin kinda op
Badass pig returns should be the second name of this animation
The ultra pig Cames back
Pig with techno powerrr!

Dude, every time. Every single time, it gets better. 1:29 3:33 Look at the frickin depth! The background is amazing and the animation is so smooth. I mean, I should expect nothing less from the fourth AvA but still. And even in the first AvM the squash and stretch in the zombies and creepers. You are amazing. Also:  Orange= Power (Chosen One's Return) Green= Skill (Music, Building, Fighting) Yellow= Engineering (Redstone, Technology) Red= TBD (Hasn't had his own episode yet) Blue= Science (Trees, Nature, Potions, Experiments, Cooking)  Edit: Just noticing that one of  Ultra-Instinct Pig’s effects is “Gotta Go Fast” symbolized by a Sonic Ring. AvS??? No… okay.

I was really hoping for the pig to turn into Technoblade XD
God there's always so many things going on in one fight scene you have to go back and replay to see every bit of the fight, as each has its own little thought out section. So much eye candy :D
Can you please make the chosen one (the orange guy) have that powers that the pig just got by drinking a pition?!🙏
Hes back!!!!!! the pig
dis vodie is so good:)
So who is the pig, technoblade, pigacles...
7:41 my favourite fight in the whole video also 10:00

You know everything's about to go down when the pig drinks the "Techno Power potion"
A more exciting adventure with worth the risk for.

Я обожаю твои видео
That pig only used 0.1% of its power.
Wait- if all of the dyes that the animations turned into were associated with thier color, and when the witch was hit with the potion, they turned purple, does that mean that the witch is the purple animation?
11:39 shoodooshi would be epic
Wait... when did the purple guy gain the trust of the entire crew ???
I have been watching since I was young and nothings changed I still love it you didn't end up like monster school I still like ultra instinct pig

hey !! Alan, why don't you make a video where Celeste makes a song he uploads it to YouTube and little by little the song's fame rises and after a few days they make a consensus that more than 1,000,000,000 people will attend and then half of the consensus begins to They burn everything and they try to put out the fire but they can't and they end up most of the people upset and little by little they lose their fame and then they go back to doing themselves from before.   I hope you read my comment and put it at the end of the video
Alan had to ask himself at some point questions like "now, how would a fish fight with a sword" and "how does a piston emote".
13:41 hhahahaha

My GOD, that is not ordinary Minecraft pig!
amazing video very good this fight looked like a dragon ball fight and a very good one punch man alan becker you are great at this in animation now also understand why it took longer than usual your animations are more than 1 minute i was inspired by you and tbm i started making my own animations and mine has only a maximum of 30 s alan becker your work is great inspires people! Great video I'm speechless as good!
To be honest when that pig drink all that potion I expected it turn into a Pink Stickfigure.
Fun fact: Sugar kane grows pretty fast.They are very thick, and would need a lot of force to brake. Kane does not grow as fast in real life than shown in the video, but since that is a human there is more control of the growth rate of the plant.I guess... 7:42
Whos idea is it to make the witch have godly skills
Keep up the good work
11:14 techno power

This dude fools us all saying he was an animator, when he's indeed a fight choreographer ^^
......orange in the wonder land
Must say: Theses vid' are getting more and more creative as time goes by. High prop to you Alan!  on a side note, that moment at 11:14 gave me some "I'm a spider, so what" vibe (that scene in the manga when a group of human used "Appraisal" for the first time on the MC and are stunned and horrified at the sheer wall of stats and skills they have just antagonized)
The piston reminded me of Wall-E
The bamboo was going crazy.
Топ

Eres grande Alan eres muy bueno con tus animaciones

The best part was from 11:50 to 14:09  The end was amazing   purple invited them and went in portal but these guys didnt go in  because they thought it was a trap , purple checked if there was anyone still there but they all left. Purple got sad but when they (orange cyan red and yellow) saw that it wasnt a trap they turned around and walked in the portal with purple .......   i wonder what is gonna happen next i'm really exited for the next episode. ALAN you are the best animator i have ever seen.❤❤❤❤❤

It's ironic on how this minecraft animation was related to a witch and below it is theorizing from where a witch came from lol.
No one:the Zombie has to die in sun

Can’t wait for the next one
I think that portal is not corect 😣
Stickman wants extinction of humans
Clever Idea for using the Wool to represent the Colored Stick Figure. Since they can't speak (except for Orange). But who would have thought Green, Yellow and Red can do their things even in their different Shapes. And cool Idea that you used your first Note Block music. Even though Orange wanted to get some rest, he knew that Green was very good at not only on buildings, but also on music alone. But... I'm not sure if we are going to trust Purple this time. I mean, I knew it he will come back one day and he played League of Legends peacefully, but... how did he get out of prison the last time we saw him? I hope you know what you're doing, Guys.
increible asombroso lo mejor que allan echo
Where is the pig in the end?
This feels like among us

I like the pig
In the pig potion thing there are a couple of things to note Resistance, absorption, slow falling, luck, water breathing, night vision, jump boost and haste show up twice Fire resistance and speed (one behind pigs face) shows up 3 times He gets invisibility but doesn't go invisible There are two custom potion effects being techno power and gotta go fast He gets effects you can't get from potions such as haste, conduit power, dolphins grace and absorption.  Some of the duplicate effects show up in their new and old versions. The ones that I mentioned are speed, fire red, jump boost and night vision If I missed anything let me know and I'll add them
11:12 Dejavu

OP pig is back
Only in Alans videos can you see a block of sugar cane from Minecraft be badass.   Seriously dude, you and your team is super talented. I'm happy you all decided to continue animating and do your best to be creative and do what you love.   Any time I see a new video from you, I know I'm in for a treat. These videos for me, are always fantastic. They're fun, charming, have so much character and personality with barely a word of dialogue (which is super impressive btw), well put together, and almost never fail to make me smile.   To me, this channel is proof that if you have a passion for what you do, you can work hard and be able to not only continue doing what you love, but thrive with it. You can be successful, gain useful skills, and be happy just doing something you love. It won't happen overnight, and it will take a lot of hard work and effort, but the pay off is definitely worth it.    Bravo to you and your team, and thank you all for sticking with us through the nightmare that was 2020.  Here's hoping this year will be more productive and a little more happier for all of us. <3
Go beg woo 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
On 11:14 you can see one of the potion effect is Techno Power

11:15 Technoblade origin story
I remember that pig
와 정말 목빠지게 기다렸다
Jai piggy
You have to give props to Allen for being able to make this video. Like how smooth the animation is when they are all fighting and transforming between the different blocks in the second to final battle, just how their characters swap over to mobs, then blocks, and items and the Sugar Cane, JEEZ. MVP behind the Pig on this one
My first thought on Salmon Red         Sally
11:15 why do i hear technoblade?
4:53 A fish with a diamond sword I gotta get one of those
the witch  made Yellow turned into a llama Red turned into a fish Green turned into a sugar cane Blue turned into a moving piston  (THE WITCH IS A MONSTER . HE NEEDS TO END)  Edit Ruben's power is back 11:12
OP pig is my favourite

The pig: gets technopower buff The witch: ah frick

*Fun Fact:* At 11:15 there’s 2 status effects called: Techno Power referencing Technoblade & Gotta Go Fast referencing Sonic
In one of the pig's potion ability: "Gotta go fast."
That is "some pig"
I've always wanted to watch a pig demolish its enemys

Jesus christ the fight choreography in this is insane
The witch took their DNA and made copies of himself that could transform into the AVS crew (except the Cursor). Edit: Now that I listened to the UI Meme Music, the battle is basically epic UI without the music
Cool pig killed a witch, cool

13:46 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Techno power at 11:15
11:38 THE MINUTE ONE PUNCH👊👊
Did anyone see Techo Power when the ability’s show up
That pig is epic
Since the witch was so hard to kill, could it have been purple who was the witch? The dye was purple and since when the stickmen were turned into the dye of their corresponding colours, and the witch’s was purple, i know they got punched away by the pig but since purple on their own desktop had managed to get to the end, they couldve possibly ender pearled back. Im also taking into consideration that they didnt have hands, but the stickmen were able to drink the potions to get back to normal so they have some form of grasp in those forms, but its only a possibility  Also, they could’ve accidentally turned into a witch due to the potions but were still able to move due to them not losing any limbs, and how they were skilled when in the different mob forms.  Finally, the way they were able to turn back so quickly, when they landed, they most likely turned back after they threw the pearl, (maybe the brought milk with them incase they were under their own effects) just in time to collect those blue flowers for the stickmen to coincidentally encounter them
did anybody notice techno power effect in the pig (reuben) effect checking moment lol
Ok, what the heck is going on lol
okay okay enough with the meme comments, here comes the actual commentary of this video (apart from DJ's reacting directly lol)  I can see how much hours upon hours you've spent animating this episode. I noticed a LOT of separated entities and background details throughout the video and I can imagine the pain on how many layers you had to deal with per object. Even something as simple as Green being a sugar cane or Red as a *salmon.* a FISH-  This series has come to a seriously surprising twist! I love how smart you are to use most Minecraft aspects and put a little twist of your own imaginations.  Your characters can show so many expressions and emotions without faces or voices and that stuff is impressive as heck. The way you show how it feels to be Red, Green, Yellow and Blue's perspective as objects/animals is so creative, and how much you can add to a simple story about these stickmans. Even the pig! The pig can show emotions with a single face! And that's just amazing  The fact that this video is 14 minutes long yet so entertaining to watch is perfect! I'll always wait for the next upload from you
11:44 dragon ball be like:
You get better everytime
Pig foda
Purple: *flaps arms* Everyone but orange: *flap flap flap flap flap*

*Mistakes at the video:*  4:21: Zombie not burning at sunlight  5:20: Fish isn't drowning (Been out of water like 20 sec)  5:30: Sugar cane isn't near a water source or flowing water  And probably other's i missed or it's the purpose of the actual video  Note: This isn't any hate comment or something just to correct alan, if he doesn't correct any or doesn't read this its ok it's still a amazing video and im a fan. Keep up the great work!

the last time i saw technoblade pig in alan becker video was in lucky blocks one
Super dupper
NICE! MORE OF THIS!
Alan, I dare say some of the strongest aspects of your combat is the contextual catharsis. You really know how to establish a villain and make it SATISFYING when they're beaten. You've established the Witch as cruel by separating all our dear friends and cheekily escaping all rightful retribution, typically through teleportation and transmogrification, and the action scenes that follow are cool but the Witch is always portrayed as a badass threat all the same through their own skills, even though they're still infuriating as a character.  The following action scenes provide the heroes a way to combat her tricks by reversing her transmogrification but that only goes so far and they're cornered.  And then we get to the final battle. The pig getting empowered is a cool as hell callback but what's even cooler is how the pig turns the witch's tricks right back on them. The teleportation fails as the pig simply follows her through the portal and proceeds to stunlock her out of pulling out any potions. And, just as when she gets her window of opportunity to throw one, it catches the potion and throws it right back before delivering the final blow. It was satisfying to see such an incredible fight scene and for the villain to get their comeuppance. You have a knack for this sort of storytelling, mate. :D
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I just love the animation i just can't stop saying wow with out watching this video

とても面白いです
Honestly I am not afraid to say AVM is my favorite anime

Kung-Fu pig saved the day :D
There were 2 potion effects called techno power (after techno blade the legendary minecraft player) and gottago fast with a sonic ring as its symbol.

Я русский
11:14 Technopower and Gotta Go Fast effects should be nerfed in the next update, they are too OP.
11:15 Ultra instinct pig :) That it says: "Truth is, I am not a hero of justice of anything else like that. But anyone, who hurts my friends, IS GONNA PAY!!!". That we hear: **Pig noices**

Underrated channel
hey @Alan Becker ! have you ever heard of image interpolation AI? It could save you time in your animations but it requires a powerful pc
People who disliked this are not human
to the alan becker team, i would like to say that i love the content that you made. But seriously, that shape shifting fight scene is out of this world, literally. You guys really make good content that makes the day better.

Damn the way the witch uses blue is genius
EY the PIG is OP... a pig has defeated 1 enemy and 5 stickman, how can a pig be stronger than me (sad face)
3:12 the Llama is best at redstone than me 😲
The return of the pig
Seeing one of them become a pumpkin, I now wonder what if the other 4 stickmen turned into iron blocks and become an iron golem together.
Pig vs witch is more satisfying than Fox vs Fox in melee.

When all hope was loss the pig became technoblade and saved them
🐷🐽🐷🐽🐷🐽
I like bucket
Awesome
Piggy be goin’ ham
That pig is actually Technoblade transformed into a pig and is actually being kidnapped bc the witch wanted to harvest his power. He was first kidnapped after he fell into the void and didn't die-bc he never dies. And as you can see in the super powered pig area-he drank a Techno power potion-created from the energy of Techno. His power is infinite-I'm just wondering when he'll return back to his former state.

Now this is what i call creative
Uhu
Great imagination, creativity and animation
Alan is master of breaking minecraft logic
With every animation, you get better and better  I loved it
me when stickfigure:
That pig should have the award for the best pet ever
Русские собирайтесь под моим комментарием! Сколько же нас?
The fish fighting is probably the weirdest yet most entertaining thing I’ve seen and I can’t explain it
To build a witch farm for all of it's great items especially for blue- you'll first have to dig though the code of (such and such) and right into the main PC.
Red just casually fights with a sword,       as a fish...
When i see the zombie dind burn under sun light without a helmet i be like: wait that sus, why dosent he burn, the yes he was the witch
Lol black plasma studio just posed their animation too at the same time
4 MINUTES AGO
