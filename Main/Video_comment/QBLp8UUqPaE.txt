If you think using a bitch is cool etc you are the real problem I'm not surprised even the devil liked music lol got to be careful what the ears hear and what the eyes see we are living in a more intensive warfare than ever before...
Teaching the new generation of young men to be male users / prostitute I like rap music but the lyrics in this song worries me about why we will not get better as black people more emotional men instead of discipline and leadership and providers. We are in trouble if we think this kinda music is okay 🙄

Real shit .... Memphis stand for .... making easy money pimpin hoes is u no the rest 💯💯💯💯💯💯
People will be glorifying all this nonsense songs. Everything bitch, disrespecting women, nonsense tattoos all over their body, smoking nonsense weeds. No wonder they always kill themselves. Talented artists but sending wrong messages out all the time corrupting young people. God will not take you through something for you to be using corruptible words after he has helped you
I love Finesse2tyme but his disrespect towards women on a whole nother level. What's wrong with loving one woman without all the games and disrespect? They know they role models and they setting the wrong example by this. I'm sorry it's true. I don't call this talent but distasteful
I can listen to this one and Luv and Hip hop all day long their both fire and funny ass hell
my gramma think its robutussim

😮 Durk went Extra Dumb.  My God
First artist in a solid decade where AD SOON as I heard a few bars, was like ay yo it might be some here.  Followed up finding three to five songs and ALL EAS FIRE, and successfully like back in the day randomly found a artist new to me that was fire. First thing I noticed was his lingo. real recognize real, and time behind them walls make it real easy to know when a mf done time and if he real. So glad I found a new real ass artist
At the end of the day, GOD took me thru those 5 years to make me understand it... That's how a grown up talks. Much respect to the two cats for acting like grown ups. It has to start somewhere. Maybe now others will see that it's okay to get upset and speak up when you have to but, it's not okay to take it to that other level folks been taking it to. Talk to chit out like grown folks then continue making yo money, period. Grow da phk up!!!

U hit the hoe raw old sick as nigga💪🤭🤬💯💯💯💯💯
🔥😂🤟🏽🥴
I get it now get it by any means
I hope we as black people make it out of poverty,self hate and self destruction. This just tells me we have a very long ways to go. This is his economic strategy is breaking a “hoe” a “bit*ch”. Then we wonder why it has taken over 400 hundred years because this type of man will go against his own people’s interest to get a couple coins that he probably won’t have 20 years from now. This person is equivalent to head house ni**gas who help to persuade and manipulate and bring down his own people.I pray that his ill intentions only negatively affect hisself, his immediate family and friends and not the rest of our generation who actually want to make it out. I can tell you who he serves and who is master is. To all the black men that went through something that really stand on business like raising your kids and prospering yourself and your future generations by way of example and great character. I’m not talking to the real black men. I’m talking to the  cowards that will do anything for a check and a name. Ladies please choose wisely because your sons are depending on you forreal. Love yourselves and protect your future because these dudes are not
AYE I FK WITH 2TYMES❕❕ i js gt put on
Finesse is LAF. Can't wait for the Mob Ties Rico. Start a shooting around your family just  shows how narcissistic you are. That's not gangster that's ignorant. But I'm sure he don't know the difference 🤣

They want to trade places and be the female. Ugly azz. This is evil imps of the devil.

Well ladies here it goes. Men stick together. Ladies promote the "woman code." Psalm 68 11-12 # Go get it We know it's entertainment but no man can break us, but God! We break to bind together better.
I give them the most utmost respect for joining together you know what I'm saying I can do it no better and no other no better way you know what I mean by sticking together sticking together you know what I'm saying just cause it for more money more more everything
These rappers so hard joining together they was just beefing with each other this this type of show material is kind of tight

💯 I think I'll stay in Memphis
† We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing in our hearts that Jesus died for us, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we have done or will do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                           †  Romans 10:9
played in traps wit the hand 2 hand to overseas now
is that rowdy rebel? or his brother. this was fire tho!!!
And now, little children, abide in him(Jesus Christ); that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.   (1 John 2:28) - We are all sinners. Believe in Jesus Christ, Repent and be saved.

M. E.M.P.H.I.S. Making - Easy- Money- Pimping- Hoes-Is-Serious
Definitely need a album with these 2

This shit hard
This is what Real Mature Man does squash the Beef Believe that 1000
I’m sure bagg will get money with bro but he won’t trust him after wat he said in the pass
Straight Garbage 🗑️
I just gotta premonition that these niggaz gonna start beefing again after this short lived banga
Both combined 🔥  Glad to see they are working together power in unity 🤝
🙏 we only here for a limited time, so it's only right to get it 🤑 together 🦾
He got the fuck off 😂🔥💪🏽💯
I’M ABSOLUTELY LOVING IT!  I’m from Memphis but I live in Alabama, it hurt me so bad to have found out my two FAVORITE Rappers were at odds. I told my Family that I would LOVE to see them get together, because I didn’t want to have to choose a side. When I heard they were doing a duo, it made my heart so happy! This is setting the bar for black excellence and unity!! I HAVE THE UPMOST RESPECT
They both 🔥 they needed to link up and drop some fire 🔥 as shit
Yesssssirr💯💯🚀🚀
I know they squash the beef… but he still shouldn’t left money bag off this track
That’s raw🔥🔥🔥
This what I was hoping for
Got real 30s
Y did bag go so hard on em like that
I think moneybagg yo enjoys features nowadays
💪🏿
Bro who ever shot this video killed this shit the quality and the edits transitions OmG 😱 man I gotta find a video man like this 🎊
I'm glad to but this song ain't s#!%
That’s wassup I’m glad they ain’t crash out and did real 🥷🏽ish. We better together than apart when it’s like that. There are ppl in life you just better apart even then you still don’t have to beef or kill a person if no1 died in a situation and it was just feelings/pride hurt. This was gods for the culture both street and hip hop. How it ended I wonder if that was they first time watching the interview together.
🤞🏽🤞🏽
Kinda weak
1:48 damn bro 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
BANGER!!!!
Yung Hot too federal Bagg you should go grab that Nigga fr

Now can gucci mane and gotti make that definition of g 2
They don’t want us to normalize squashing beef. Let’s make this the new trend
Boi still got hustle and flow money
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.  May God Bless you all! ♥️
Nah finesse taking over, it’s been long awaited and well deserved.

Yes sir. From Beef to Business. King Shit
They don’t want us to normalize squashing beef. Let’s make this the new trend
I wonder if they know how big of a hit this is ???
Low frequency. Low vibration. Lower self. Smh.
2 Peter 2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.
Remind me of Club Hughes
https://youtu.be/bUpOKnyit6I I deserve a deal

This how grown men do I salute u both. 🔥
2times did not need Moneybagg for anything, to be honest if his verse wasn't on here I'd probably like it even more
This just changed the narrative of how rappers are viewed a chess move it’s bigger than music
BREAK HA FUCK HA LEAVE HA
I fw 2Tymes he be snapping
Keep ya foot on they neck p. Big playa move connecting wit bag duke played
Shot go dummy
That's differences should be handled Bit what I can't get pass is how come they couldn't settle the difference with young Dolph?? I could be wrong but I think I know why .. cause water and oil don't mix ... When you just too slimey ,n grimey and just down right evil And greedy !! You will never get along with people with good souls . Rip king Dolph king of Memphis.. fyness obviously couldn't stand on his own two feet .. what a shame.. he didn't need bread gang .. or CMG and would've had more street cred and respect by standing on his own like young Dolph proved .they hated Dolph soo much because he stood on his own two feet..
✊🏾🖤💪🏾
🗣GENEROSITY!!!!! ❤💯✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾

This is the craziest shit I’ve heard in a long time…..do y’all dude hate the ladies……so much aggression to the ladies, but so docile with the enemy…..I often wonder do these people not understand that the plan is to give ignorant characters money to lead the masses astray…..it’s much easier when the society values materialism…….god help us and help these charismatic brothers understand that if they are this effective being negative imagine how valuable to us they could be if they preached a positive message
Moneybag n Finesse need to drop a collab mixtape 🔥🔥🔥🔥. New tracks.  New flows. Salute these men for squashing the nonsense n getting back to the money.

In high school you was the man homie , wtf happen
That big hard 🔥🔥🔥🔥
2 young black men came together instead of killing each other
Bruh I’m still a street ni*ga, cop a bow from me! Let me get that!
Imagine if some of the biggest artist who beefing actually came together and squashed the beef even though blood may have been shed and was able to move from a place of love instead of hatred and violence and ego imagine the impact that would have on the black community we could literally take our power back all we have to do is turn our love inwards and help one another we could really skip timelines. They want us beefing because with us beefing it's a win win for them we get killed they get paid vs if we helped one another we would cancel them all the way out they profit from our demise we got to wake up family sending much wholeness love and light
We needed finesse in the rap game 🔥
I love it

https://youtu.be/A0DD3wXV334
Growth is a big part of Expanding your life and career, Shii these men smashing the gas and ain't even worried about the rear views of any mirror ( referring to reflection of them as rappers in the industry). They have literally just brought back the struggling affects of their own actions and took it to a place that is going to lead them to beginning legacies and traditional tendencies in the hip-hop industry, which has ventured off into becoming industries!!!...They have gave the upcoming artists a visual image of actually being very able , if your willing to give that kind of dedicational commitment to yourself can lead you to become a independent industry leader yourself, you become a building industry based on your brand or personal name in which you choose. Jay-Z said this on the blueprint., " I'm a BUSINESS---Man!" Referring to the fact that he turned his name into a means of building a brand , which eventually turned into a Industry....In fact turned into a whole mf movement and Legacy. His life is told through his gift...and his art, music. The gift which turned into a legacy forever. That is a power move bruh, anything is possible when you visualize the things that you want and complete the work in painting it the way it becomes beautiful to not only you but impacts those around you for years that don't stop...Infinite legacies of you and your work. I really respect these two individuals and really the World is about to witness the blessing in which they are giving to the young ones coming up...Even the OGs gonna feel this one...One Love Brothers!!!! -Bezzo
Real 🥷 do real things
I miss dolph!!! Long live dolph !!! 🙏
So we all just go act like he not saying put it a nicca meat. Nah brah I don't care what dat shit mean hand or not.. matta fact if it mean hand he saying put the meat in my hand!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Sexy seeing a street nigga admit #Goddid save him💯
The doors are closing, don’t be left behind accept The Gospel today before time is up!  These material things will pass away, focus on your soul  “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” ‭‭Mark‬ ‭8:36‬ ‭KJV‬  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.” Romans‬ ‭3:19-26‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭10:9-13‬ ‭KJV‬‬
That's fire 🔥🔥🔥

If only Dolph an gotti could’ve put they pass too rest would’ve been a big move I guess he sacrificed his self too make Memphis open they eyes
Fam I don't understand what he saying in the end... I want to cuz I feel like it's important... But look though the song go super hard. Shout out to real niggas who stand on shit though I'll always have love and respect in my heart for the culture.

The top 10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners ever!  1. It's been Monday all week. 2. Few women admit their age; few men act it. 3. Atheism is a non-prophet organization. 4. Why is "abbreviation" such a long word? 5. Ask me about my vow of silence. 6. You can't have everything; where would you put it? 7. What happens if you get scared half to death twice? 8. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool.  9. A flashlight is a case for holding dead batteries.  10. The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.   Editorial: Perhaps the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

Finesse two times you that s*** man family tires on the g that's what Nick has been waiting for real n****** rap a lot baby keep doing what you doing man
See and this is why you DON'T go Public or make Live Videos bashing someone bc you just never know if you're truly done dealing with that person or not.  It's great that you two came together and made this video bc that's what some fans would like to see however, it looks a bit Fake to me.  I'm wondering was it all for Publicity/Money Move or bc you wanted to make Music with Moneybagg🤔 but didn't know how to go about it?🤔
They make good music together I'm glad they got right
This is real. I respect. to see two to boss link. We with it. Keep pushing setting trends
I love ❤️ to see this like fa real this is how it’s supposed to be.
Mob tie. The hardest In the game. Salute. We stand with

#salute
I'm loving this shit this is wat life is all about. Come together and get a bag. This good content. This gone hit over a mil views B4 today is over wit 🛸🛸🛸🛸
The Legacy begins good job brothers!!!
Damn i was waiting for this👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I wish Big and 2pac would've had the chance to do this. Glad to see this because I fuck with both💯💯💯
Bagg took a page out of that A milli video. Good to see these dudes back at it
Respect fuck beef get money together two great flows
This is amazing put the past behind them and get money together
Greatness in the making🌟....big move kings✊🏼
Tennessee Maine

THIS SOME REAL SOLID SHIT.
Bout time real dudes link and get money
This tight 💯👌🏾
I salute 🫡 Y’all get that bag 💰 together Much Respect 🫡
Great to see but both of them didn’t snap I’m disappointed redo asap
If these young rappers could put their pride the side it would be alot less deaths surrounding rappers big ups to Bagg n 2xs Boss 💩
Bag verse was better so the rap stealing shit dead
🔥
Good shit they both hard 👏 they started together and now they both could money 💰 together
legendary freestyle 2->https://youtu.be/1je-dICUoA8
I wish Dolph and Gotti could’ve ended their beef like this ! 100 💯🤞🏾
Let's go
Coldest part of this video is the Bosses sittin' together,w/no ego,watching 2Xs #BigFacts  grown man talk. This the grown Man wave in process💯
Life is made to go forward not backwards. They moved forward and getting money together instead going backwards and going back to jail
bagg just kilt his old ghostwriter on a track can't hold him
This what we hoped jack boy and Kodak would of done
This may be something big for the music 8ndustry, gotta start somewhere...too many poets dying
I'm not even from Memphis I'm from Louisiana but that's a great look for Memphis I salute them boys real shit Memphis stand up that's dope 💯🦍😎
🔥💯💪🏿💰
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the hardest way to squash beef ever great work!
Now this leading by example in the rap game hopefully 🙏 all y’all fans follow
Jr. a real ☝️
I love to see that black men coming together instead of killing ourself. Now that real nigga shit right there!❤️🤑🤑🤮
Good work this what we gotta show the youngins
He understood that 5 made him realize, now his dreams came true with Money 💰 & MobbTies. Congratulations to both parties like a celebration
The Beginning
Real shit yall
This the realeast shit I seen all year fr
🔥
Big energy. Squash the beef, get the money. It’s simple
Bagg was a nice touch to dis, I mess wit it
I love this shit
This could’ve easily been Thug and Lucci.. Atlanta fumbled the bag!
They done brain washed 2time
Tennessee shit !!
If you read this comment. Iwant you to keep it with you for the rest of your life. Akademics already said that the record label owners party together. But they artists beef. Stop feeding into this bs. Our music is entertainment.
Dolph would still be alive today if him and Gotti could've came together and did a calab, instead it was the hate
I love that ‼️
I'm watching the video I see them together which is kool but it don't sound like Moneybagg yo rapping on that verse
💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯

RAP GAME FINALLY GOT A TUNE🆙
Memphis need this as a whole, Only if Dolph and Gotti could have done this but theses 2 brother are setting an example of how men should be
That nigga went back got his nigga
Crazy how they can reconcile but  Trae an Zro can't salute these 2
Hardest outro I've ever seen with all them on the couch watching the interview 💯🤝🏆
That's real shit, we as people gotta want life for people instead of death... Im glad these brothers are back together.
Dam I wanted to see one of these fools kill each other
Real nigga shit
Zro and Trae was suppose to do this.
My opinion in the comment said it's good to see them come together bull💩 they fake.🐍🐍i don't care for money bag he don't have a back bone. Think about dolf didn't nobody come together with him & even if nobody want to mess with dolf they didn't have to murder him period. So all this coming together is fake 💩.been took money bag off my playlist.he is a fraud.👎👎
2tiyme  Beating on his chest on this bihhhh  I hear the respect in bag verse 🔥  Artist gonna know Wht I mean

That's what's up 💯👍🏿 real men
Finesse and Moneybagg Yo have such complimentary flows and deliveries. They are both great in their own ways too but hearing them work together is always a treat. I think the fanbases are generally really similar too which is nice to see likeminded people collide every time they collab. I hope someday I can gather even a tenth of the amount of fans with the perspectives that theses two fan bases have for my own music. Truly unmatched energy🔥
Yea these boys about to put out one of the hardest Mixtapes ever.
Realest shit I seen in years ‼️‼️
🔥💪🏾🔥💪🏾🔥💪🏾

Shit seem cool but Finesse going to regret signing to somebody you once beefed with especially when killing was spoke of……. Should’ve just been satisfied with the mob ties deal. Energy don’t even seem genuine at the end of the video 😵‍💫 Hope it end up genuine because all it takes is another dumbass in one of their camps
Damn finesse really shit on FNG.
I’m glad you gat this shit right bro I needed somebody else to listen to
Mane bruh yall just don't understand that being born & raised in the M wit all the rap beefs that's ever happened either publicized or not this exactly what the city needed especially wit all that's goin on in Memphis thus right here is what it's about💯coming together being a stronger unit rather then killing each other off..

🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
I guess I'm going to do with this not racist but common sense white folks do invest in a bunch of niggas to crash out and just watch it for entertain because if they ain't going to kill each other then they going to try to kill me so I really have killers kill each other then try to kill innocent people because they don't have no more people to kill or control
I like when we put the bs too the side
This nigga two times talking about he would have sell his baby mama just to get the money fuck out of here not me I hope my baby mama can't be strong enough and now weak enough to let me do some s*** like that to her even if she got to tell the police or some other man to help her or just kill me and my f****** sleep because material is not better than human being as a black man why not just learn how to make things with your own two hands in your mind instead of selling a woman's body or taking it from the next person that's the only thing I don't get with other boys from the hood it's not that hard to learn it just take time and yes one thing you're not going to get is glorified and a whole bunch of champagne and roses from people you don't know personally but you do get a family and loyalty
Bout time🔥🔥🔥
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐#Bagg #2tymes
These niggas dont get enough sneak dissing YoungBoy smh, i just want to see all black men just rap and get money even if you all got to lie about what you're talking about as long as you're not getting into it with each other but if niggas starting something with somebody then it's entertainment I'm just going to sit back and watch and let YB finish it just like he keep doing
🔥
💯💯💯
CUZ HEAVY
These boys bout to be a problem
The search for the weakest handle has a new contender.
show this to the youngins and let em know it ain't all about dying in the streets no more 💯

Memphis finally coming together 🖤🖤🖤
I’m starting to believe he really Came Up Off The Hoe Money 💰🤧
머니백요 이불에서 나오는 거 실화냐ㅠㅜ
The reason they was able to come together and squash that s*** is because blood was never shed, remember that. 🩸
I happy they squishy that shit now time make money X2
The fact he took ownership of the beef is everything. Whether you're in the streets, young or old, carrying that pride and ego's on ones chest will never make you see the bigger picture till the point you can't see it at all. I hope this change the face of the rap game when it comes to disagreements.
🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🎤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
🔥 Aunty likes this. Already was a Moneybagg fan...Just started listening to Finesse2Tymes .....got bars......But now!!!!  Now.......not a fan, not a cooler....call me Central Air....A/C   Y'all went hard on this one. #SeattleReady.
Y'all run it up 1million views 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🎤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
That’s real 💯
I would've just squashed the beef made music together and either started my own label or signed to CMG before actually signing under Moneybagg.
I'm shocked I must admit I didn't see this coming

I think I can rest now. All I wanted was these two to reconnect again. 💙
These lyrics.  I never thought that I would ever say this but being black is becoming more and more shameful by the day. Money means that  much? I now just identify as a human being. I am not a color! I don't identify with this crappy culture! I hate it! It's shameful and disgusting. It's not talent!! What has any rapper ever said that just makes you go crazy? It's a joke! They are paid alot of money just to embarrass black people by making us look like fools throughout the world. Violence,  ignorance and promiscuous behaviour is uplifted amongst us. This is absolutely insanity! We are doomed! 15 to 20 years from now, we will be back in bondage. The world saw dogs and water hoes put on black people by the media, today the world sees the foolishness,  the ignorance and violence of black people by the media. I cringe with embarrassment.

I replayed this this like 10x already
To me, this is irrelevant! They never had an issue: allegedly.The question is.... "What happened to Dolph?" I don't think they wanted him as their Boss. I also think that Dolph's power moves was a problem to their entire movement.#noloyalty
Now this is what the RAP GAME NEEDED❤️‍🔥💯🔥🔥🔥🔔🤞🏾

I appreciate these two brothers for doing something so great and amazing and rare at these times .salute to these two brothers they changed the narrative and gave the culture more with this and gave us real bloggers who don't promote the fuckery some real honorable and sturdy content

Shout out to Jprince he passing down true game, these men are monumental to Memphis and the rap game what better way to show these young niggas coming in the game how to put the beef aside  persevere life and build something bigger than themselves, this how we get down in Texas for the most part, (Texas and Memphis go back decades we like cousins) the Ogs before us showed how to put petty differences aside and unite and get this bread 🍞. “The white people laughing at 'em, that's what's happening they sayin stupid ass niggas still ain't figured it out Long as they stay divided, man we gon' run the south Y'all need to get up out the dumb shit I got a bread truck, get up out that crumb shit, nigga” -Pimp C ❤️🤘🏾
