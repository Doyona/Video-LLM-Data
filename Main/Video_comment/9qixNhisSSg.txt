Odd question but does anyone know the song playing in the background from 7:00 onwards?
I can’t believe Kon is friend with miniladd….smh
just watching through your setup videos for the sidemen. I must say sidemen are very lucky to have you you do a lot for them which is making sidemen videos sick with all the hard work behind the scenes by you and the team.
I WANT TO LEARN
I'm unfamiliar with Sidemen. Is there a podcast episode on YouTube using this set? I couldn't find anything.
Where can you watch the new podcast?
I really like those light up shelves, any links guys?
WAIT Guys did Kon actually EAT the foam!????
that space is prolly a million pounds and its so small lmao
Rick Owens
11:02 “Omg it’s Mini Ladd” 💀💀💀
The Sidemen are great and all, but their best channel is Kon’s for sure. Big ups!
is Air-kon a premium version of kon XD
Looks so similar to Impaulsive lmao
Hm
Does anyone know what type of wall shelves are those with LED ? I could definitely have those
This is literally the SideSideMen and I'm here for it
you already know i got that annual sub
Where is the sidemen podcast channel at or unless u have to pay for it or something.
Sidemen podcast should call logan paul for an episode
Show us Simon's studio !!
Why was Gary Neville drilling?
When’s the reaction for the sdmneditchallenge2
So is side plus going to be similar to Logan's extra content thing. Would be interesting to know how many people the Sidemen employ and sub contract with on a monthly basis.
Can't wait to watch these podcasts for free 😄😏
It Smells like Greatness. "We're fartin here."
You do not need the cloud lifter for the sm7b if you have a go xlr if someone wants to know
this guy stole my name
Side+ is class if you haven't got it, get it. Avengers 6 directed by Kon... heard it here first!
Guys please unlock advanced preferences on Logic Pro X... The wooden bars haunt me
fiddle around with a wrench and then build megatron lol
$700 DRKSHDW's chilling on the desk
🔥🔥
9:03 the legends speaks his words
Kon is such a good guy man
Gg
15:40 I love how you said that you love to produce high quality content while playing Heskey Time in the background
big ups for the 1 mill
I enjoyed this, good idea lads!
makes me jealous i want one sm7b these have 4 like whatttt
Kon you fr are a goat thank you for helping the sidemen be what they are now
The entire setup just tells you how successful the sidemen are
Just wanna say thank you Kon the set looks amazing I added this video to watch later as I sub'd for the yearly Side+ and binged watch every eps :D Thanks again Kon hope to meet ya one day!
What are you guys using for the wall?
So beautiful
Bro I’d love to join side+ but moneys bit tight atm
nice video kon really good. crazy to see how all these viral content  is all cause of ur guys prepartion and vital bts work❤🤞
Who needs side+ when we have Kon?   (I'll get it still though just kiddin)
have you got a video of you making simons studio cus this is sick
kon when is the fully renovated house tour comingg?? interested to see what uve done it
Kon Smashes it again! Great job mate!
Just look at how much they invest in the production, crew etc & you’ll wonder how people are complaining about paying for side plus. The entitlement is actually unbelievable
Damn 11:04 is the first time I’ve heard anyone from the uk scene mention minadd since yk what😬surprised it’s someone so close to the sidemen since the sidemen worked with miniladd and I’m sure they wanna forget that 😭but funny dig
Air Kon? Does that mean they flown there?
3:31
Does bas still work with the sidemen?
😅airKON
Ballz in ya jaw ksi how can i make this sexual
you even have talia’s martian symbol
As Sidemen+ becomes hugely successful, please, upgrade the set and camera setup with more static angles.
Kon John and the crew are goated, they make a lot happen
This looks great. Too bad I'm too poor for the Side+
this man need to 5 mil sub
this was so cool ahah great vid :)
Big Lad Kon is the goated!!!! God bless you, Kon!!!
Its actually a bummer that the podcast is paid.. is there any other podcast you have to pay for?..
Konstantine after listening about side+ be like: sameshit different price.
Any idea when you releasing Simon's Studio Tour/ Video?
So a question for anyone who knows, will they make a channel dedicated to the podcasts or is it on a platform other then YouTube?
Air-Kon
KONgrats on the 1 mil subs you deserve it!!
1,4 mill for that?
what shelves are thoes?
Heskey time in the end ahahah
Thanks for the upload
Wow! A big project! Thank you for using our product and sharing your studio.🔥
Why only 4 seats? If I'm going to pay for this then i need to see all of them lol.
Where will guests sit??
9:47 dammit, I wanted to spend a night with Vikkstar
My head's hurting from the way Kon kept on moving that camera.
do you have air-conditioning in the studio, looks like it'd be stuffy as?!
i can always rely on some epic Kontent
Covid was actually a blessing for the sidemen, they popped off, they used the opportunity, put in the work and immensely grew.
ouuu TMG hoodie
big up kon for doing the set up for the sidemen
Studio looking really nice here bud! Top Work! PS what make you decide to record into the Mac Mini rather than going direct into the BM Pockets?
we all want morelearning with james
Fk Side+ tbh.
Thanks so much kon this is a big help as I've got a podcast myself so I'll be looking to get some of this equipment
"We have time, but not a lot of it"                                                                                              --KONSTANTIN, 2021
Who would pay for a podcast
@Konstantin its good to know that your up to date with youtube drama after making that joke about Mini Ladd
Where's the whats good podcast transformation
oi lon's on a mil subs, just clocked that, lets fucking gooooo
ngl should've used govee lights cause they're argb and have a rainbow effect and not plain rgb, but its all right
Where's Simons studio set up vid can't wait any longer😂😂!!!
kons a legend . give this man a raise !!
Kon's videos are genuinely entertaining to watch
The set looks sick
I like how they have the Martian on the shelf for Talia
Can’t wait  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ngl, at this point, id like to work with Kon.
The Setup looks 10/10! 👌 keep it up kon!
Table gets screwed hard 😂😭
Just love these setup vids!!!!!
Elite
they passed out on a great idea (making the side+ studio at vikk's house)
hehe, air"kon"
is this podcast on side +, that's stupid
at this point i think sidemen should make a tv show and a movie
Your content 10/10
This is about to be amazing! 🔥
AIR KON
Kon is looking fit     No homo
i m gonna miss out on many things since i cannot pay but i hope i get some funny clips to see
this is actually so good
when will the editing contest results will be released
How do they do it all? Simon has his main channel, 2nd channel, sidemen, more sidemen, sidemen reacts, sidemen podcast, what's good podcast and twitch streams.
so the podcast is also a subscription based thing?
"airKon" hehe
Big up Kon and the crew
Lit ep
Kon the legend
Sucks that they think a paywalled podcast will last.
Does Side+ mean Kon is gonna stop posting BTS?
Ayy
Sick!
is the Sidecast only on Side +? I get side+ is alot extra content but why the podcast
They did this to finish the podcast scene 👏🏻
The setup is just as important as the content! Great work 👍🏽
The sidemen should use that room to do sidemen reacts too
hey Kon when are you going to release simon's studio bts
It's actually still sad that people think £6.99 is too expensive 🤦🏾.
Whats gonna happen to your bts videos since side+ said their doing their own bts's?
Where’s the setup tour of the whats good podcast?
1:01 air *kon*
Heskey time at the end 😭😭😭
The million dollar question  Who edits kon's videos?🧐
3:22 It's official, only kon can defeat jake
Bro the studio you have made is sick Kon can't say anymore than that it's just sick
I enjoy your videos Kon even when I have no clue what your on about when you go all tech on me and the technologies you guys use.   Kon: it's a az2476lb7s  Me: yep it's a microphone  Kon: it produces blah blah output with blah blah enhancement. Me: must be powerful then.  Jokes aside thanks for your videos kon keep it up man 👍
id love to see a video where kon introduces all the video team and tells us the jobs etc feel like it would be good to know the guys more and what they all do!
Impaulsive vs Sidemen Podcast
Sdmn shoes???
Will they post any of the podcast on any of there other channels?
Where can I watch it?!???
Yo is that miniladd?
How much did the whole set up cost ??
Dope, but where is Simon's studio tour kon?
looks top class
I kinda miss when sidemen was mostly Garry’s mod and gta
11:02   Nah kon WTF?!  thats a full on vio bro, don't nobody want to be compared to him
Upload simons studio
Damn does that mean no more bts in kons channel I'm gonna miss it
the one thing that stood out in this whole video was the red controller in the backgroundf
This was nice… great work
This is actually so sick! Appreciate it Kon! Can’t wait!
What's going to happen with BTS since Side+ will provide BTS footage.
Ayy we might have some sidemen shoes or something 🤔
Kon and team, thank you so much for all the insight of our favorite boys and the additional BTS for side+. We really appreciate it!
Is it an app or just a internet search website ??
Kon if u read the comments , reply with a sheeeeeeeeeesh  It will be funny 😂
I hope I could buy side+ 😂😂😭 it seems so cool
Is this where the What's Good podcast is as well?
“Who's been a TRUE fan FOR OVER A YEAR🌟”
The Sidemen and everyone that works behind all the madness, Respect just straight up Respect for you All
Does that mean we don’t get BTS videos of the sidemen Sunday’s on this channel anymore :((
Does sideplus mean no more kon sidemen Sunday BTS vids?
I Wish
When will simon and Randys studio vlog be out???????
Can we get an update on the house Kon?
les go 1 mil subs, keep it up!
I would buy side+ but I don’t have a credit/debit card
Konstantin where did you get that shirt thing you're wearing from I want one
Can't afford it boss sorry
I don’t understand anything to do with technology but I still find kon’s videos so entertaining.
Wait no onlyfans BTS?? 😭😭
I love all of your camera stuff I really want to be a photographer
I'm sorry but this is already better than any of Logans studios haha, take notes
So where are we going to find links for side+??
That's some great kontent!, Hah.. get it? Kon -tent.. hanks for laughing lads
Looks so good. Now we need "what's good" studio tour pls
much love kon, the unsung hero of the sidemen videos. 💞
It looks Like the old impulsive set
HESKEY TIME
I respect Kon for all the work he does for the sidemen but bro you gotta make some of your own content man
this is sick
9:52 wrong price Vikk😂
Kon and the other people behind the camera are the true MVP of sidemen
big up kon, without him and the crew, the sidemen wouldn't been as big as they are now video quality nuts
Are you going to have to stop the bts and put it on side+
Am to poor to afford it
Whose house is this setup at?
im realising we might not get kON'S behind the scene vids cuz side plus would basically be taking that segment off
Did the Sidemen give you the budget to buy all the equipment and to get the set made and built or did you pay out of your own pocket?  I'm assuming the Sidemen paid for everything.
Anyone here would share their sideplus account I can’t buy it because parents said no :/
I didn't know, is sidecast is on side+ or they make another channel?
I need help setting up my studio
The set has Airkon.
Is SideCast gonna be available for free?
Where’s the what’s good BTS 👀
Is kon still gonna have behind the scenes on this channel?
Kon what equipment would u say would be the best setup and desk for a new start up setup?
This is so coooooollll
Kon is top tier with these setups. Its unreal how he & the crew can get these things ready for the SDMN in such a short time, almost daily. They may be primarily YouTube but they are beyond Class S superheroes in the media quality department
5:40 lights looking like Wall-E
sus
How do we pay for it and watch it
There’s going to be no more sidemen bts’ on your channel right because they said they’re uploading bts’ on Side+.
Does side+ mean we no longer get bts videos on this channel?
Exited to watch!
Miniladd 😳
A little mini fridge...
Finally King Kon uploaded
Kon do you roughly know when the vlog of Randy and Simons studio will be out?
Who’s Rick Owens ramones are those????
Underrated channel keep up the good work
Mini Ladd 😂😂💀
Sup kon
Kon really is the man behind the scenes! Well done Kon, set up looks AMAZING keep it up! ❤️👍
Konstantin and the camera crew should get the credit for the sidemen toooooo
That intro was sick Kon U legend for these setups and greatness
are the podcasts only on side+?
I'm so excited for Side+
that's so epic
The postcast is gunna bang for sure
Can we have another payment method to join Sidemen+ please? I want to pay with my debit card but you can only pay with a credit card. PLEASW HELP ME!!! I WANT TO JOIN SIDEMEN+ PLEASE!!!
Jeeeeez🤩
Kon the Don! 🔥
This is so sick so lit 🔥 so epic I cannot wait
i cba with 6.99 with side+ i aint paying 6.99 for a shit podcast
just have to ask were the Simon and Randy office
Kon is really promoting SIDE+
U guys should do a live sidecast episode
You guys deserve alotta credit, always working hard to help behind the scenes🙏🏾
Why don’t you put the tv in front of the slider camera, infront of it
They should create another channel for the podcast
I would watch sidecast if I didn’t have to go broke to watch it. I don’t mind but it sucks to see how the Sidemen Sundays dropped in quality, like the latest one.
All These Legends of the crew behind sidemen videos  including kon are doing a great job making sidemen videos more better and better, Big Up To the Sidemen crew !
Insane video and srudio
Wheres the video for simons studio tour

YESSSIRR
I must say the content from this channel is so good.
Honestly the best tech guy on YouTube right here
Sidemen is such a great motivation for me on my own YouTube journey, I am glad I was motivated by this guys
When’s the new house tour coming out??
how do I convince my parents to buy me Side+????
Sidemen life

The beginning got me so good!
