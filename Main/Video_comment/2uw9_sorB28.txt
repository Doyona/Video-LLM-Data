" Having a nice supple rear end "  😂🤣😆😂
The best upgrade on my hardtail was installing the PNW Coast dropper. It is the ONLY dropper with 40mm of air suspension. It saved my lower back.
You don't bury survivors xD
I feel the tire insert pain!!! I just did that on my brand new Trek Roscoe 8, used a metal tire spoon and not only pearced the sealing tape strip but also put a small hole in the alluiminum inner layer!... So also some swear words and a couple days later I was able to get a new seal strip and repair the wheel with small screw drivers, picks, a ball peen hammer and a little quick steel putty for insurance... that finally worked! Although I used the Tannus Armor inserts. Looked easier to install than the Crush Core your using. You should give those a try sometime to compair.
hahaha, nice riddle. you dont bury survivors. very nice build by the way.
This build totally made me laugh so hard
You don't Bury survivors
У нас это и так очень крутой велосипед без переделок, в с улучшениями вообще космос 🚀

SunTour XCM fork would go well with that build bro....
you don't bury survivers
Ps if they survive the crash, surviving fir long in international waters in most parts of the world is slim
Bury them at sea,  Go shimano drive train all the way Go Fox 36 e float 160mm forks (not only plush as but also black with orange decals)!
Riddle:you can’t bury the survivors because if no one went to help the body’s would have sunk to the bottom of the ocean
First you have to find those people in order to burry them. And if you do get them all out, you send them to their homeland to ger burried.
I know I’m late to the party, but correct me if I’m wrong, it is still illegal to bury people alive.. international waters or not.
you cant bury them
Cush core is definitely something worthy of a man admitting to reading instructions. Anyone that has installed them knows.
You don’t bury them because they are all in the ocean
you don't bury survivors!

ORANGE!!!

What tieres die he go with?
you could use rim tape as wide as the rim so it doesnt get detroyed on the installation and probably steel core tire levers are really really helpful
when they crashed into international water which is transcend international part of the ocean. the people are buried under water because they are in it?  or you leave them in the bottom of the ocean and the area you bury them could be Atlantis, i got a new bike a week ago and it's a 2021 Rock Spring 2 what do you think of it?
defo more orange then red
Matst Just want too say that you are the reason I choose my san Quintin. looking to do some upgrades pretty like you have done here. Been riding it for about a month and really need to work on those upgrades, any suggestions for some cheap upgrades for the san Quintin. most of my issues come from rear cassette and chain slips.
None Mate, you'll never bury the survivors 🙂 bit late but just want to answer the question.
The way he went into the sponsor was sneaky
what tires do you run on your dirt jumper

Oh Matt, it's a plane crash with NO survivors... there are NO survivors to bury... [LEGEND]
Matt these build lapses are 👌. However, I’ve been following the channel for some time now and I’ve noticed that on every build you seem to swap out 90% of the stock components on the bikes you’re sent. Whilst I can understand you’re endorsed by a number of different amazing brands, I imagine there are a lot of people out that are in the market for a Marin want to see how these Marin bikes hold up to a good thrashing in stock form. I think your videos are absolutely class don’t get me wrong, but when you’re swapping out everything but the frame for super high end components, it no longer seems to like a true and fair test of the bikes Marin provide from factory. I saw your video a while back testing one of the budget hardtails and that was a top video. I reckon a series showing a month or two of you riding one of the budget Marins on bike parks, enduro stuff & maybe even race on (once we’re allowed :(( )would be great way of showing subscribers how capable these bikes are. Possibly something along the lines of “budget bike diary”. On the whole though, probably my favourite channel on YouTube by far- keep up the good work 👍
No one buries survivors!
Go for blue chain rings...
Why would you burry the survivors?
Thanks for all the awesome information Matt! I just got a hardtail and I'm loving it. I've been wondering what to upgrade on it and knowing the little extra than actually changing a tire or tube, is just amazing! Thanks my friend!!😉
Orange
Nooooo Matt you should put a fox 38 in orange to Mach the frame
You don't bury survivor's !! Haha 😃 love the build please let me win the gear I need new forks BIG TIME !  #newrider
give them a funeral on the place it self
You don’t Berry survivord
orange brooo
You don't bury survivors Matt. Also, 36 with the Grip 2 will look great
There are are not survivors, the orange fox fork would go but is a bit dated. Ohlins would be sic though. Also shimano drive train would be cool.
a berial at sea and i defnetly thibk u go with olins forks and what ever drive train of what ever u want honestly i just need bike upgrades love the vidios by the wat
Matt. You said before you helped develop this bike. So why not develop it with all the uprated/modified stuff on there ready to go from the shop..? Seems a bit pointless developing a flagship hardtail bike then upgrading pretty much everything.
Bury them at There home town
there were no survivors and you count berry them anyway
Love this bike, great upgrades too. How is the sizing on the frame? According to Marin's website at 6'1" I should be on an XL but I've always had large and don't want it to feel too big.
You can’t burry survives
Funny shit ..I just love the humour and real life problems fitting shit.
If this whole bicycle riding thing doesn't work out for you, you can DEFINITELY get work as a product presenter - like those late night shopping shows.
Riddle: you cant bury survivors
You should also go with Fox 38 factory orange
You need to go for Box one 1x12. The orange box symbol will match the frame and same with the shifter. It will look fire!
Could u maybe ride a really cheep carrera once pls
There were no survivors so you don’t bury them

Hi interested getting Marin SQ3, I’m 176cm (between 5’9” and 5’10”) and having trouble choosing between medium or large size frame.  I’m more trail riding and single track on a hard tail.  Any advice what would be my size of frame? Much appreciated. Thanks!

Riddle: there are no survivals. Forks: Rock Shox  Chain driver: Sram Eagle NX
what offset of fork you having matt?
The only reason the survivors would be buried is because they can identify Joe Biden as being responsible for ordering the plane shot down. TRUMP 2020!
There are no survivors. Everyone’s dead and it generally not a good idea to bury a perfectly happy survived. I think they might object a little.
You can’t bury survivors unless it’s a load of tories
How can you burry the survivors if there is no survivors
Cool build vid! Riddle: nowhere, survivers are alive and you also said no survivors.

There are no survivors. Go for some RS pikes and make it a somewhat affordable dream bike?
U can't burry survivors cause their alive.
You don’t bury survivors because they didn’t die
There are no survivors, everyone dies. Fork= Cane creek helm Drivetrain= Box prime 9
if you burried survivors that would a pretty dark thing to do since they still breathing. Also you said everyone died so there are no survivors to bury alive if that is what you wanted to do
you bury the people at the bottom of the sea cause there already dead there / ohlins fork??
riddlle: there are no survivors if they all died and burying someone who survived a plane crash wouldn't make any sense!
you don’t bury survivors lol Fork: fox 34
No survivors!
There is no reason to bury survivors, because you just don't do that, and everyone died anyway. Love the orange chainring, compliment it with some Fox Float and stick with the Shimano 12 speed.
You don't bury survivors!
You can’t Berry them cause it’s already a graveyard cause u will be disturbing the dead that’s why they can’t get the titanic
Me thinking orange is so goood!!!!
Marzocchi forks would look mint And a Kcnc or garburak gear stuff would look even better. Ad i think you can use shimano with that cassette and still fit it on the driver
you don't bury the survivors
Everybody dies. And you dont bury survivors 🤣🤣🤣
16:02 Matt: a plane crashes and kills everyone  Also Matt: where do u burry the survivors 🤣😂
Warm the tyre up in hot water becomes more flexible
You don't bury the survivors anywhere because you said everybody died. And ALSO if there were survivors you still would bury them because they are still alive. And you should put on Fox 34's or 36's  (depending on how hard you are planning to ride.)
You don't bury survivors
Put on Fox 34's
If everyone died there wouldn't be any survivors. However there was this guy on the plane that's shagging   my ex,  I am going to bury him but I'm not saying where... by the way I drive a digger at the Audi Nines 🤙🏻👍🏻. Love the channel dude!

Riddle : If the crash killed everyone there are no survivors and burying someone who survived a plane crash wouldn't make any sense!  Fork : Öhlins 150mm with orange Öhlins logo would be sick Drivetrain : shimano xt but with orange jockey wheels to match the bike
You don’t berry the survivors  Personally I would go with some fox shocks to change it up
First of all you shouldn't bury survivors cause they're not dead, and you should put cane creek helm forks on it or ohlins ones cause we all know you love those and a trp g-spec tr12 drivetrain which the derailleur comes in gold or silver colourwave and is compatible with sram 12 speed cassettes so you don't have to change your hub
You should put cane creek helm forks on  the marin san quentin 3
Orange all the way
"plane crashes and kills everyone, where do you bury the survivors" you legit said kills everyone but oh well
theres no survivors
You don't bury the survivers
I'm almost certain you shouldn't Berry survives as there alive aha

Use a sram 12 speed cassette NX or SX or something else lighter for the shimano splined hub as Shimano gearing is compatible...
Stick with the shimano and change to the microspline driver, forks wise you have already done Ohlins so maybe something new and exciting. I say Manitou Mezzer pro....why, because back n the day Mantou and Marin were a shit hot combo and it would be awesome to see it back, a bit of heritage if you like.  Riddle: you dont burry them, they are already at the bottom of the ocean or eaten by sharks!

You dont bury survivors, you buty the dead, but as everyone died, there should be no survivors and as such I'd assume you'd send back any recoverable bodies to their home countries to be buried by their families.   I am just getting into mountain biking, so idk what fork or drive train to recommend. I'm riding a Giant Talon 29r 2 though 😅

You dont bury survivors but all the dead people can just bob around in the water. I think you should go for a formula selva r fork
Riddle: you said first that the crash killed everyone in international waters so that means no one survived and any body that has been identified through the search will be sent to their country to bury. But you later on said that where do we bury the survivors, if there is any survivors  you do not bury them because obviously they are alive🤷. For your fork I would suggest the lyrik from rockshox and for your drivetrain I suggest shimano xt but I guess you have to change that freehub body or the wheel itself that has micro spline on it for that to fit in.  Have a good day much love from Philippines.

Cant bury the living... They'd be a joint or capable/ closest nation retrival programe, with repatriation to follow.   But if they'd all died the countries would have to work together to retrieve the dead if possible and theyd all be buried in their respective countries.... If un retrievable then that GPS location would be some sort of dead sea memorial/ burial waters/ see creature feasting water/ coral rejuvenation for all involved nations.  Plus ben was on point that orange...Dopeness👌

Riddle: you cant bury survivors and there wouldn't be any survivors anyways.  I know you didnt ask for this but if I win I'll be so grateful as I got into riding quite a while back and i'm now in 3rd year and have been riding the same xs frame with cheap parts and no disk brakes for 4 years. It's way to small and its holding me back at the minute so it would mean the world if I won this. Sorry if this seems like begging.  Edit: I had a lot of typos

There are no survivors. Ohlins forks, use proper tyre soap like what garages use around the tyre. Im sure you can get orange reservoir covers for the hope brakes as well 😍
Riddle: you do not burry the survivors, but in this case there are no survivors. Forks: the Ohlins are great forks, so good choice. And for the drivetrain, I think you should consider shimano, probably xt or xtr, because from my experience shimano shifts very well under load and the chain retention is much better.  Awesome video, waiting for the second part, keep it up Matt.
You dont bury survivors  You should put rockshock lyrik fork And Shimano 105 r7000 drivetrain because then you going to be fast as fuck👍
Definately an orange bike

It’s either in a graveyard or that they never found them and  they are still at the bottom of the ocean

You said bury the survivors so you don’t bury them they are still alive.    Fork - https://www.bikeinn.com/bike/specialized-ohlins-rxf/137583708/p?utm_source=google_products&utm_medium=merchant&id_producte=10817605&country=au&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlv_9uc-f7AIVjGkqCh0PPQAlEAQYAiABEgJXHPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds  Get some sort of rainbow cassettes that is smooth and fits well with the bike.   I am trying to win these forks because I am stuck with some 80mm travel giant forks that are scratched and have been ridden hard so they don’t run very smooth. And it would be an honour to have something like that.
A) you don’t  bury survivors  B) there were no survivors

Hey Matt! So you don't bury survivors and also no one survived!   Regarding the forks I do like the ohlins but for a change how about dvo? And for the brakes it has to be hope!   Also have you thought of doing a dream build competition with jono? Who can build the best dream bike? I'd be well up for watching that!
You don't bury the survivors you dingus😋 You can always run an 11-50 12 speed cassette on this hub, but that wouldn't be an upgrade really.
U The survivors will not be buried because they survive not dead.
You don't bury the survivors, because if there was survivors, they survived and don't need do get buried, but you said that there are no survivors :)

There are no survivors to be buried (you don’t bury a survivor)
That unboxing at the end though🤣
1. There’s no survivors bro 2. Ohlins is obviously stealth and premium as heck, but if your looking for something fun the marazochi bomber Z1 comes in red AND it’s a coil fork! Which would be a sick feel. 3. Have you tried the trp drivetrain? Also you can do Di2 which is shimano a electric shift.  Kill it on that bike!
Nice build and content matt.. keep it up sir! 🤟
Since everyone died both from the crash and drowning. Bring then home and bury them where their families wished them buried. 😅 Always wanted to see Ohlins on a Hardtail so Ohlins for me. For the drivetrain, Shimano Deore XT all the way! I hope you do shipping to the Philippines coz I’m here. 😂

Riddle: You don't bury survivors
Riddle: You said in the beginning everyone died, so there are no survivors. But there is no real solution to this riddle........haha  Fork: RS ZEB  Drivetrain: Shimano XT
There are no survivors.
Only bury the survivors when they die. Assuming they won't die from a plane crash in international waters, you bury them in their graveyard of choice, or if they went the cremation route, that's ideal
You don't bury survivors as they survived 😂.  Ohlins forks for sure  Shimano 12 speed drive train 👌  Amazing builds 🔥
Ihink Fox Float 38
Orange definitely
RockShox Pike Ultimate gloss silver would match with the Chainring
why would you bury the survivors...  FOX 38(180 mil)

There are no survivors to bury
I mean do you really want to bury people alive? That´s kinda weird isn´t it....
Riddle: well first you said, “no one survived”, considering this you wouldn’t bury them because they sank. In case you were able to save bodies, you would bury them in their home country. Second you asked, where to bury survivors, but you wouldn’t bury them if they survived. In conclusion: unfortunately your riddle is self-contradictory
Fox shox
you cant bury suvivors little man                                                                                                                                                                                                throw a fox 36 on there and the new gx drivetrain

If everyone died you can't bury the survivors cause there isn't any Some DVO forks would look sick Maybe go for box components drive train they are quite good
Riddle:  because they all died, you should bury each them inside of big bike park jumps so they can feel important. Fork: OHLINS!! Drivetrain:  Shimano xt 12 speed
Leave them in the middle of the ocean  SRAM 12 speed XO1 Atlas Fox 34s Orange gloss Kashima Coat and grip 2 or Specialized Ohlins RXF. Sorry I took so long to comment because I was out ride all day I am building a hard tail and I need a few parts.
theres no survivors because everyone died soo you cant burry survivors if everyone died
Garbaruk 12speed cassette with a standard Shimano freehub rather than the new micro spline would fit the halos. Added bonus, they can come in orange.....
Riddle answer: no one survived
Riddle: No survivors. How terribly sad. Now fit that beast with the new ZEB (I think there is a 150mm version) and SRAM AXS (you know it makes sense) and then hand deliver the giveaway parts, my pyracantha still needs a trim and you're the only man for the job.
There are no survivors and do a sram 12 speed set up
Riddle: you can’t burry the survivors cause everyone died Drivetrain: TRP TR12 M-850  Fork: Rock Shox ZEB ultimate

Rockshox pike for the fork
You cant bury survivors
Riddle: Just leave them be on the ocean because they are already dead and they will just be burried on the sand on the bottom of the ocean and it would be insanely expensive if they try to get the died bodies below the ocean. Item:Any Hydraulic brake please because I am still using mechanical brake for my Hard Tail and it sucks. Any Hydraulic brake will do Matt I am not picky I just want to have hydraulic brake to change my mechanical brake into hydraulic brake for my hardtail 😁 IG: Kayvincephil18 Hope I can win something🤲😇

Riddle there weren’t anyone on the plane it could be a drone plane  Fork:RockShox  Drivetrain:Shimano

Riddle: you can't bury survivors, as well, there weren't any
You can’t bury survivors
You dont busy survivers 😂
Dude, you can't bury survivors.
You don't bury survivors. I don't know enough about this stuff. I am a mtb noob but I like free stuff
Theres no survivors because you said everyone dies.. also you dont bury survivors. Cmon man, I have kids, you know I got dad jokes
Riddle: You can’t burry the survivors as no one survived and if they did survive you wouldn’t burry them alive.  Drive train: Box One 1x12 with orange bits Fork: Öhlin all black with orange logo.  Love the vids! 😄🤟🏼
@mattjonesmtb You don't bury survivers! Definitely go with the ohlins fork if you have to option. And an 11 speed SRAM XX1 X-DOME.
Riddle: Everyone dies so there are no survivors and you are not supposed to bury survivors anyway... i guess :D Fork: you can go for the orange matching fox  factory but I think it is abit too much orange. I would put a black one on it so it matches the Marin logo on the downtube. I prefer the MRP ones cause they are black and have some really nice orange accents. Would look sick and in addition to that it is something different to RockShox and fox. Should have a look on them. Drivetrain: 100% the box one. It also has orange accents which matches the bike. Again something different to the Sram and Shimano. You could go for the Sram stuff with the copper cassette and chain. I can imagine that but I feel the box one more. I would also put the orange/black kmc dlc chain on it. Matches perfectly.  I'm trying to go for a black orange comb. Not too much orange but everything should have the same theme. With the orange accent it would look sick as hell 🔥😍  Btw big thx for doing the giveaway 👍 don't have a bike atm but I am enjoying your videos damn good. Would like to see you doing some bikepacking. ☔😎
U dont bury the survivors because they would be alive
If there are some dead survivers don’t bury them cuze they survived but also do cuze they’re all dead!?!?!🤣
There's no survivors and send me some of Ben's old stuff because I have up MTB and bought a BMX so I could ride with my 4 yo son... <3
You don’t bury the survivors as they are still alive
Riddle: you can’t bury a survivor, you will be imprison!
Why would you want to bury the survivors ?????
you only burry the dead  Also you should definitely look at an intend fork for it as well as a Box1 drivetrain or something
What a bike!! Can't go wrong with the hope brakes, but otherwise, the Braking IN.CA.S would be epic if you want something a bit more exotic! Fork: Super exotic Intend Flash or the Ohlins RXF 36...   Riddle: Why bury the survivors? What do they know that they shouldn't lol.   Look forward to the ride video!
Riddle answer: there aren’t any survivors because they are already dead. Fork: use fox 36 and a sram drive train
You don't bury survivors , unless you're sick ,twisted and inhumane. For the forks go for some Pikes in black with red decals. And a personal favourite drivetrain you should use is Box One Prime 9 its amazing you'll love it !!!
Don't bury survivors Matt, there aren't any.

Fox Factory  36 Grip2
you don't bury survivors cause they not dead Ohlins fork or the rock shocks Lyrik either 1 would look amazing on the bike  and the drivetrain has to be Shimano (:    - thanks
Tuck the tyre bead down under the Cush core as you go and you’ll be able to get the tyre on without using levers at all.  Dunno what fork to suggest but I reckon the Fox factory orange won’t match with that frame well. Riddle was daft, you don’t bury survivors, and there were no survivors.
There is no survivors if everyone died
You canny bury people when they are alive Matt!  Forks: New Fox😉 Drivetrain: Shimano xt or xtr 🤙🤙 (Also badly need new cranks man🤣)
You can’t bury survivors

You don't bury survivor 😂
Everyone dies, plus you dont bury survivors. Ohlins forks and box components wireless drive train.  Got a san quentin 2 which would appriciate some handme downs from his big bro.  Nz based but you could always deliver in person the parts to queenstown and we could go shread some trails.
try cane creek forks!
You don’t bury survivors...
Everyones gone lad, btw maybe try them DT Swiss forks? Also Shimano is a solid choice indeed.
I feel you pain with Cushcore I almost burned the world to the ground when I was trying to get my downhill bike fitted with them. I finally found a decent way to get them on. But I hated everything for about a week during the installation.  Answer you dont bury survivors
You don't bury the survivors ! Why not try some mad looking cantilever fork, like the Adroit Single side linkage fork?  And the drivetrain doesn't matter - go chainless !
Survivors can't be buried but then again you said there were no survivors so i assume they have that figured out lol. You should do Fox 36 for the forks, and Shimano XT for the drivetrain! <3
Bomber or fox for forks
You dont bury survivors. ^^ correct answer Allso once the first guy solved this very very tricky riddle everyone else can just jump on that answer (assuming its right)  But love you and your vids, keep them coming. Fork: love the look of the ZEB (not sure of your sponnos though.) Drive train: anything wireless is mouth watering. (Period) But I am Shimano bias.
Why would you bury the survivors? Definitely run hope e4s again. Think you’ll prefer the shimano drivetrain over sram, it just works so much smoother and better
Gloss silver finish Rockshox Pike ultimate, will go perfect with the cranks, cheers

In international waters the riddle because the plane crash in the sea
Obviously u can burry survivors but that would be a kind of crime I guess. But the correct solution is, you don't bury survivors and all death people you'd burry there where their familys want them to be. Awesome build btw👏

Matt we both know that fox 36's are the way to go, for the back I think use the 12 speed cassette and try to tailor it to fit, with the single ring in the front.  RIDDLE ANSWER: There would be no need to bury the survivors because they survived but then again you did say that they all died so how can there be survivors, in case u mis said the riddle then we would bury the dead in their respective countries decided by their immediate family.

You don't bury the survivors because they reanimate and become aquatic zombies.

@mattjonesmtb - you said no one survived! And you don't bury survivors anyway of course. So can my 13 year old son have your bar, stem, and anything else, because he's sending it hard out here in the French Alps and his bike could do with some upgrades. #eliottsends.
You don’t bury survivors, I think the ohlins logo will look great on the bike, not sure how easy they are to get hold of but trickstuff maxima brakes might look good too they have orange accents quite expensive but for a dream build would be cool
You dont bury survivors Formula selva R forks! (Orange adjustment dial😌) Fit the 12 speed shimano
U don’t Bury survivors
I think you should caveat the fact you are going bigger on the suspension travel is because of the type of riding you do (upside down / and off cliffs lol) . Most people riding XC or bike park trails will not improve their ride quality by increasing the travel on a hardtail, as they are subsequently impacting the geometry of the XC bike. Those bikes a built for going fast and forwards , and for climbing :) also the wheels are not what you would typically upgrade with if you want to win races etc
there are no survivors cos everyone died fork: dvo drivetrain: xt is fine
You don't bury survivors, they are still alive. Unless you are twisted or they have Covid.... Too soon? 😜

You don’t bury survivors. Forks: Ohlins Drivetrain: Sram GX
You don't bury survivors matt. And you said it killed everyone. And to be fair the bodies of the deceased are probably all snaggled by sharks.  I guess go orange fox 36 fork.  I would say XT drivetrain to match the brakes but your changing those...that obviously leaves you with AXS. Maybe buy XT and swap it  over with your brakes so that one bike has all XT??

The survivors can't be buried cause there aren't any. And the water takes care of hiding the evidence. I'd say chuck on some fox forks. Maybe fox 36 forks cause they colour match the bike. For the drivetrain I'd say chuck on the Shimano stuff cause you already have it'll work well. I also think it'd be cool of you did a single speed conversion on the hardtail and made it a homemade dirt jumper.

Okay lets talk tyre inserts. Put the tyre on without the insert first, inflate it and get it seated. Make sure it holds pressure without sealant. Then let the air out and open one side of the tyre so you can put the insert in. Once you have the insert inside the tyre start putting the tyre back on from the opposite side of the valve. The key is to get the tyre into the middle of the rim and underneath the insert. I've found that pressing on the tyre with something that has a round end works perfectly. Then once you get to the bit where you can't get further without the other side of the tyre starting to come out take some straps or zip ties and make sure you get one side 'locked'. Add some lubricant to the edge of the tyre (I use a silicone stick, the kind that you rub on your car door seals during winter) and then wiggle the rest of the tyre in. If you're using metal levers or breaking plastic ones then you're doing something wrong. Also do not add sealant before you've tested that the tyre holds air.

But sram XX1 would be sick.

U don’t berry people that are still alive Matt 😂😂
Riddle: 1) you said everyone dies so there are not survivors, and 2) if they were survivors they wouldn’t be dead therefore no need to bury them.   Fork: Red Bomber Z1 or Fox 38 Drivetrain: Shimano hands down.
6:54 you should install the insert with the channel on the side of the insert where the valve is. in this scene it's the thing you see on the left side of the video. the way you are doing it is making it much harder, you need to press the bead of the tyre into the centre of the rim with a tyre lever, then you can use hands to pop the last bit on. as stated in the instructions. Cush Core also has a specific tyre lever for this job now, I have one.
If you bury the survivors You need a therapist and an insane asylum...and maybe a straight jacket  Ohlins rxf 36 SRAM XX1 AXS

U don’t bury survivors  Got to be ohlins  SRAM wireless
no where for 2 reasons. 1 and the most obvious there are no survivors and secondly, what sort of bastards bury any one after they survived a plan crash. lol  but really we only bury the dead, not the living. Fox 36 with the orange lowers would look sick. My 14 year old son is saving up to buy his first bike, hoping to be the San Quentin 2. So any spare parts that would improve would be awesome. His current ride is a $50 rincon that is missing several teeth of the front chain rings and he just bent the handle bars after going over the front testing out a bush track him and his mates are building.
Fork should be rockshox pike 150mm

Riddle: you can't bury survivors.  Fork: maybe go with the Marzocchi Bomber in orange/red which really would match the colour, but maybe it ain't high end enough for the dream build. However, they have gained some very good reviews. yet the Öhlins are dope AF.   Drivetrain: KCNC has made this really awesome cassette that would fit the build perfectly and also match the absolute black chainring - as can be seen in the linked image:https://cdn.bike24.net/i/mb/79/5f/ed/317186-00-d-657898.jpg. The best-suited drive train for that cassette is the SRAM eagle. which for even more customization can be upgraded with an orange jockey wheel.  Best regards From a huge fan from Denmark^^

You can’t burry survivors that’s ridiculous  You should look at the new stuff rock shox is doing with their forks they’re pretty sick and super high tech.  I work at a bike shop here in the states and that’s all anyone talks about. SRAM came out with this sick cassette that’s sort of a bronze color that might go well with your bike too.  It I highly recommend looking at the new rock shox forks but ohlins is a great option always!
Nobody can bury them since they are all dead and by now at the bottom of the ocean. Forks whise, I would go with öhlins or a rockshox lyric if you were wanted to make the bike something we could all build.

There are no survivors! You could put a FOX 36 with the orange factory lowers or use some orange ohlins stickers on their fork. I also think you should replace the driver and keep the Deore 12 speed. Then you can use orange crimps on the end of the cables!!
I personally wouldn't bury the survivors, might get in a bit of bother doing that....  Stick with the Shimano Drivetrain, Ohlins forks for that stealth black front end. They simply just look the best
Hopefully I win 🤣🤣🥳🥳
There are no survivors, you can't bury anyone. Sram xx1. Fox 36, fully orange :D
Also for the riddle you Barry each person in there family’s  country
when you said "buildlapse" and than this melody came up i was expecting you running around the bike with 10x speed like in Lockdown series :)
SRAM drive train 11 speed and sram hanger
Intend bc forks
If everyone dies in the plane crash then there will nobody there to retrieve the bodies so they will sink to the bottom of the sea and the won’t get buried
But if ur all ded  you can’t Berry them

@mattjonesmtb Recently had my 2019 Marin San Quentin 3, Santa Cruz Nomad C and my mates Orange Alpine 6 stolen from my house in Kent. Can honestly say the Marin San Quentin is the one I miss the most. Such a rad bike man. So much fun. And hardtails without a doubt make you a better rider.

Riddle answer Matt, you don't bury anyone 😆 SRAM X01 FOX 🦊 36,s   So happy the contents coming back 🤘🏻 the MARIN marmalade? New bike name 👀
There will be no survivors so you couldn’t recover the bodies. Sram xx1/xo1 with copper cassette and chain. Fox 150 travel suspension black
If everyone does then there are no survivors either way you don’t bury the survivors. SRAM xo1 with fox factory 36 with orange lower would loooook sickkkkkkkk. Looks such a nice bike stoked to see you riding on it soon.
What I’ve been waiting forrrr
BOS forks
If it crashes in international water it will be difficult to find when it sinks so they will be buried at sea in the water it crashed in Hope brakes in matching orange Cane creek helm fork to match the cranks Run box one instead of the Shimano because it has matching orange details and the chain is amber rose gold colour🤘
Don’t bury anyone if there is no survivors
You don't bury survivors                             I would go for Shimano xt drivetrain  with rock shox zeb fork
I wouldn't bury the survivors, I don't think they'd be happy. Be interesting to try box 9 speed, see if the range is good (alignment would be like the mid 90s....). As for forks, ohlins, custom graphics.
There isnt any survivors 😂
We don’t bury survivors! Got to be sram Eagle and the new Marzocchi DJ’s

Riddle answer: you bury the survivors in there home country so the family can see them.
For cassette, go with a sunrace 11-51t 12s you can use the classic body instead of micro spline (i use it too with xt 12s) For forks, you can use ohlins or fox of course but dvo would be cool too. For brakes i would go for xtr 4 pistons.  I think i helper you a lot ;)
Yess
Answer to the question: You burry each person in his original country where all his familly lives. Forks: ohlins pls Group set: Shimano xt is op Also, I love your dream build videos, i have seen at least 5 times each. Please continue doing so cool vids (Sorry for my english, im from Spain)

There are no survivors and it would be really cruel:D
Orange
Can’t bury the survivors
1. U can't bury survivers cause there alive 2. but u already said everyone died so under the sea I guess or all the countries decide to fly the victems to their home countries.  Go shimano 10 speed with a high gear ratio means less variable gears but also means less mucking around trying to find the perfect one.  Marrzochi z1 forks air or coil could look sick with the red lowers and black stations
You can bury the survivors if you want 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

You hopefully wouldn’t bury any survivors. Marzocchi have a new DJ fork. I have a neglected orange mssile that would love these parts. Unfortunately I am in Finland and old 😉. You should collect some kids bike and upgrade it in your workshop with the spare parts. Sorry for the ramble.
Everyone is dead so there are no survivors and you can’t burry living survivors

Could I have some old forks that you do not use anymore so I could hang them on the wall as a sick art thing and can also say we’re yours      Ps it’s a joke
The answer to the riddle is : there wasn't any survivors and you wouldn't burry the survivors. Great up grades dude.
Riddle: You don’t bury survivors! Forks: Rockshox lyric ultimate (silver to match the cranks) Gears: Shimano Deore xt (because the new hyperglide plus is smooth under power) Bonus: Cushcore make a tyre lever which will save your knuckles and hopefully help get it on... and off!

Answer: if everyone dies and there’s no survivors then you won’t have to bury anyone. And get orange fox 36s to match and shimano slx gears
I love the bike it’s so cool
The answer is there is no survivors so even if there where you wouldn’t bury them you should put a shram 1x12 and the fox 36 or 38
Ohlins 36 or a fox 36 would do u well. Love my 36 on my Hardtail. I have seen people running rockshox zeb on their ht too
Go for intend-BC reverse fork ;)
Fox 38 for the forks 😂😂        1200 pounds who would pay that ????😂😂

If everybody is dead, then yeah you dont need to bury anyone. Good Luck at all!
Riddle: If everyone died in the crash, you wouldn't have to bury the survivors because there there wouldn't be any left. I think you should put Fox 36 with full kashima orange lowers and a box drive train :D
In what ever country the plane is registered too ,and go for dvo forks or formula (formula do purple forks I think ) and run xt derailleur with a sunrace cassette so you can keep your freehub
You don't bury the survivors because they are still alive
one you can’t bury the survivors thats illegal and two everyone died and three they would be buried at the bottom of the ocean and four if they are recovered they would be buried in the cemetary

There where survivers, and even if there where burying them would be a bit of weird thing to do.  -The new EXT era fork looks interesting, -Get those hopes on there -Be Interested to see your thoughts on the XT so stick with that 🙌
Those hubs are mint
Typically you wouldn’t bury survivors as you know, they’ve survived. But you also stated everyone died so there are none!
Go for a intent fork
Everyone died so their aren’t any survivors and fox 36 forks  and shimano xt
Last time I checked you didn’t bury survivors , rockshox zebs ,SRAM XX1 Eagle AXS DUB 12Sp Groupset
You bury the dead, not the survivors.  Also, how does changing the fork travel affect the bikes geo?  I assume you have accounted for that but just wondering.
Yooo, you bury the bodies in the home towns. Although they died the bodies survived in international water. You wouldn't find them all thats for sure.  Been wanting a marin for long now so this be a lil step closer 😂
Riddle: you dont bury the survivors, you bury the people who died. Fork: Fox 38 for the orange Drivetrain: sram xx1 eagle axs.
There are no survivors
you don't bury survivors
no one is alive and no one is near the area and they crash in water so it is hard to find the people and have to drag the people out  so you cant Burry them
Riddle : there is no survivors to bury Forks : öhlins Drivetrain : Shimano XT
You leave the body in the international water  Fork=orange fox fork
You don’t bury survivors and I would but the oliens forks you run on your other bikes as you would be more comfortable on them as you know what to expect🤘🏻 I would put the shimano 12 speed on🤟🏻🤟🏻 keep up the good work
You won't bury people alive that arnt there go sram xx1 golddrivertrain with gold xx1 deraileigh and orange fox 36 . Love vids
Mr Jones the answer to your riddle is quite simple, you don’t. Their were no survivors. And they are at the bottom of the ocean.  Also for forks the more travel the better. So I think that the Ohlins RXF 36 air fork. And run it at 150m travel. Or 180 and test the strength of the head tube.  For drive train you should run ( If you can) the eagle gx. I have that on my stump jumper and it’s amazing.
That’s the most orange bike I’ve ever seen
Riddle - Don’t bury the survivors, I don’t think they would appreciate it and bury the dead If there are any or give them a out to sea Viking burial.  Forks - Fox 36 (orange) or even better just get öhlins and maybe get the yellow/orange lowers with the black logo like I saw on Loic’s DH bike if that’s even possible. Drivetrain - Sram AXS because it looks clean with no wires and maybe the new bronze cassette if it works with the orange/red.
Well there is national law which means every country comes to an egreement
The riddle answer! There are no survivors Forks: Marzocchi bomber z1 or fox 36 factory fork. (orange) Drivetrain:Sram xx1 eagle AXS  This would mean so much if I won cause I have the Marin San Quintin 1 and need upgrades. It would help so much. Thank you

You don’t bury survivors and there were no survivors, Rockshox zeb and SRAM NX Eagle 12 speed, but obviously get the stickers on the forks custom like u did on ur galaxy dream build but like orange
You don’t bury survivors because they aren’t dead. Get the new fox 38s with orange lowers to match the frame. I think you should go for the AXS drivetrain again, looks cool.
If everyone died. Then the people got buried alive. Then there’s no one to bury
If everyone died, there is no one to bury😬.
Trp drivetrain  cane creek helm where the people are from
Riddle- The sharks eat everyone. Dead   Xt drivetrain and pistachio fox 36 🤑
Why do survivors need to be buried again?😂 survivors dont get buried and you also said there are no survivors.   Also put cane creek forks on and just change the freehub body and stay with the shimano drivetrain.
Survivors don't need to be buried👍  You should use SRAM xx 1 Eagle with the Bronze casset and an orange fox fork
you said where do you bury the survivors, so the answer is that you don't bury them.
They all died so nobody’s buried alive  Forks fox 36s kashima coated  Drivetrain sram xx1 eagle AXS DUB
Riddle: You don't bury survivors Fork: Fox 34 float factory Drivetrain: Sram AXS with gold cassette

I can answer your riddle you don't bury the survivors. They are still alive😁👍 You shoukd definitely go for 150mm Ohlins fork. Drivetrain go Sram wireless 🤙

Everybody’s dead so you can’t bury any survivors.  Olins and try out a box Drive train
Shimano dior 11 spd
If everyone dies than there would be no survivors, so there would be no one to bury The fork I think you should go w a fox 36 like you always do, And shimano xt 8100  Insta: Nathan._.baker
Saying "you don't bury the survivors" doesn't really answer the question. It's more of an observation to the question.  The real answer is, "in the cemetery, after they die of other causes."  You can't go wrong with Fox Floats. Tried and tested.  150mm of travel means you're looking at a Float 36 or 40 (depending on the abusive future you foresee) and seeing as you like to ride, I'd go with the Grip 2. Fine tuning the shock gives you an excuse to ride this bike as much as possible.

Every one died so there were no survivors. Rockshox please😁
You can’t bury the suvivors cos they would be alive and also everyone died 😂
You can't burry the survivors
Viking burial. And I think for forks any fork with black and orange decals would look sick and for the drive train, anything but sram.
Burying survivors would be almost as criminal as choosing the red crank over the orange one for that marin!  [Everyone dead = no survivors to be buried = free parts ;) ]  Love the bike, love the vidoes, go for Ohlins forks!
You don't Barry survivors

You can’t bury survivors as they’re alive
Dont bury survivors, as they are alive. Try a marzochi fork, possibly bomber z1. Try sram gx, best value drivetrain
Well Matt everyone died so there are no survivors, so it would be difficult to bury them, but say there were I personally wouldn't want to bury them but you do you! For the forks Intend bc look very nice, definitely dream build components, and for the drivetrain I think Garbaruk is rather spicy, plus you can colour match the largest cog and make it orange!
riddle: you don't bury anyone since everyone died
Well... They won't have to do this as they are in the ocean, everyone is under water 😉
The answer is you don't  and I can't recommend anything at the moment as new to the sport this year and don't have the knowledge ( why I'm witching your video)
You don't bury survivors and there weren't any anyway! For the drivetrain I'd stick with the 12 speed XT. For the forks, what about going for a classic set of Marzocchi Z1 wedges?!
you can’t bury a survivor since they are alive but there aren’t any their all dead You should run a rockshox zeb so you can have the stiff 38mm stanchions Also go with the xt for the hyper smooth shifting
they are all in the water so  you can't bury them.

Haha clever riddle one needs to listen carefully  First: you said everyone dies Second: one does not burry survivors😆  As a fork take a öhlins or maybe try something completely different like cane creek or formula  And as drivetrain maybe use the Shimano xt 11 speed or sram axs electronic shifting   Finally you are back with awesome videos hope to see more in close future. Lets go!!!
you don't bury survivors and there wasn't any. forks: marzocchi bomber z1 drivetrain: box prime nine
That's definitely an orange bike. and it looks amazing. Riddle: you don't bury survivors. How cruel 🥺
Have you tried Uberbike for titanium bolts?
I do barely any bike builds compared to max Fredriksson
You dot need to bury the survivors because they are still alive! Forks: Ohlins rxf 36 m.2 trail air 29 ttx18 Drivetrain: sram xx1 eagle shifters 12 speed 170mm GOLD (2020) I think the gold will go really well on you bike, however it is 12 speed, so the driver won't match. So you could use the hope tech pro 4 rear hub , or you could use the xg-1199 x-dome cassette which is a 11-speed. The colour of the cassette would also match that of the hope brakes o ur other dream build. But I think there is a black version instead (xg 195 I this or something like that). Also for the forks the fox factory 36 could work really well ad would go really well with the orange colour scheme of the bike.  Love these videos ad ca't wait to see the rb project you've bee working on. Would also be nice to see some more backyard trail videos cos im runic out of inspirational for my backyard trails!
You will burry the body’s from the planes takeoff point (where ever it took off) or you’ll burry them in the nearest dump and call or a day   It’s a joke btw 👆  Also for the forks maybe go back to the old time and put on some foxs 36 maybe and I think you should make the hard tail single speed , that might be fun  👍🏼👍🏼
Answer to riddle: you don’t bury survivors because they’re alive

Matt there are no survivors, that's the answer to your riddle. I think you should go for the ohlïns forks (specifically ohlïns RXF 36 650b 150mm) after seeing your video in Ecuador I think they are perfect (might give you that final push for the sponsor 😉). I experienced shimano xtr drive train and brakes, the most perfect gears and stop system I could ask for (it's so instant that I flew off my rent bike because I dot the brakes mixed up and flew over my handlebars in an instant

You don’t bury survivors. Well, you could but not sure they’d be impressed!!
The people are buried at a graveyard chosen by their families   and put ohlins rxf 36
Riddle answer: You don't bury the survivors anywhere because you do not bury people alive, the crash killed everyone, hence no survivors anyway.  I would say use a fox fork because of the orange decals, however I like the Ohlins forks you've used in the past.  For the drivetrain you should use a Sram wireless setup. The wireless systems are really nice and bespoke. I know wrong video and all, but I really love that you've come back to your backyard trails recently, making the school year better for me Matt, thanks!
You can try to bury them anywhere, but people who are not actually dead have a tendency to dig them selves out again.

The answer to the riddle is that there are no survivors so you don't need to burry them.

Extremely nice video, laughed the whole time 🤣🤣🤣

There aint no survivors on the plane Matt, doh! Anyway, I've always fitted inserts into the tyre, whilst the tyre is on the rim, rather than onto rim and tyre around it. Not sure if thats what you should do with Cushcore, but works with my Rimpacts fine. Not much harder to fit than normal TBH.
Riddle: No survivors to bury... and even in international waters burying survivors is probably a little dodgy bearing in mind they're alive😂 And those hope brakes will work great with that bike

You burry the survivors wherever they end up dying, but it (hopefully) wont end up being any time soon because how much would it suck to survive a plane crash in international waters only to have your rescue boat spring a leak and you get trapped in that while it's going down? anyways, I was actually a much bigger fan of the red chainring, but oh well. Ohlins forks all the way.

I think you may have messed up the riddle abit. At the beginning your just supposed to say a plane crashes in international waters. Not a plane crashes and it kills everyone in international watters. The awnser should be you dont burry survivors. And thats what the riddle is supposed to be about. But because you already said that everyone died we know there is no survivors. So im confused on what the awnser should be. Is it still you dont burry survivors? Wich is what i think it would be but wouldint make sens becaus there isn't survivors. Or is it a different riddle i dont know about lmao. But either way love the videos m8 hope you keep them coming and i cant wait to see what you did with Redbull!!
Do box for shifting and do RockShox Lyrik or pike
answer to riddle: you can't burry live people fork: ÖHLINS RXF36 M.2 AIR drive train: sram eagle AXS
In terms the riddle burry the at their home town the fork go with ohlins and the drivetrain use XT
Use ohlins shock there always nice with those stickers on them goes with anything
Don’t Berry servers and do fox downhill forks for the lols and do a single speed. :)

Awesome vid matt nice to have u back... as for the riddle u don't bury survivors
Answer to the riddle you don't bury survivors. Front forks should be BOS and drive train should be sram xxxxxx01 red .
Would be sick if you got custom forks!
For the riddle: You don’t bury the survivors as they are all dead
GIVEAWAY: Do not bury the survivors as they will die. For the drivetrain I would go for something different to sram wireless maybe XTR. Fork has to be ohlins. I love you channel Matt 😜and can’t wait for the dream build to be complete! Looks fire 🔥
Answer for the riddle:   Nowhere, because they are alive (for a while at least).  ●For fork I suggest FOX 36 ROOT BEER - Limited Edition because of the orange. It is 160mm but looks so cool. ● For drivetrain the sram wireless one, because it makes your handlebar look so clean and simple.
You don't bury them anywhere as they are still alive. Would love some upgrades for my bugdet bike so I can shred harder!

There are no survivors everyone got killed
ohlins fork
YYYYYEEEESSSSS HES BACK
if you are burying survivers? you are going very wrong somewhere 🤔
Well you have no survivors, because the crash killed everyone, and even you had survivors, you wouldnt burry them.. they are alive, duh. The dead are already burried on the bottom of the sea xd, next to sponge bob.    Try magura brakes.   FOX 36 in their race orange would probably be a perfect match. Go with the deore XT, its solid. I would compare it to the SRAM GX stuff, maybe X01.
Riddle: they are in the ocean so there is no way ur getting those guys back. They ded Definitely go with ohlims and see if u can get some sick custom decals. Then stick with Shimano it’s the bomb
Riddle answer: if they are survivors you don’t need to bury them because they are alive. I think for drivetrain you should go for sram axs and for the fork go with online suspension.
Answer to the riddle, you don't burry the survivers even if their not subscribers.  Fork: definitely a black ohlans (Idk how to spell that) Drive train: probably SRAM
Matt use box prime 9 shifter
Orange fox susp   Answer to the riddle is nowhere, you can’t bury nonexistent survivors

Ha ha trick question you said every one dies there are no survivors
You don’t burry them survivors because you don’t burry people who are alive 😂
Orange and creased at that raycon plug haha
Ölins is the best Fork you Should Ride it toooooooo
All the bodies are at the bottom of the sea so you don't need to be buried. What about trying a ride formula fork? And a box drive train?
Answer to riddle: #1 u said everyone dies #2 there in a ocean #3 u also said Survivors but you also said everyone dies but ignoring that you shouldn’t Barry survivors any way + the people did die can’t really be buried in the ocean so their body should be sent to their home country. Hope this Satisfies. Love the vids too 👍👍
Marzocchi bomber z1 form would be an interesting choice in fork. Maybe put like a push dampener in it too
Please do a orange fox and axs
Put that an Orange fox on that bike pls
Its orenge
Riddle: there weren’t any survivors and you cant bury survivors and you should get the orange fox 32 float forks and maybe sram eagle axs drivetrain. You could also buy a kmc orange and black chain to go with the orange theme
Fox forks would match perfectly
There are no survivors  Suspension: Öhlins Drivetrain: Sram X01 Eagle  AXS
Quickest click ever when I saw this video
You don’t bury the survivors. But you said when the plan crashed and kills everyone....😬
You don’t Burry them because they are survivors
Rockshox Pike ultimate
The survivors will not be buried because they survive not dead.
Orange Fox 38!
For the riddle: you can't bury survivors because they're not dead, unless you're a psycho 😂
Nowhere, you don't bury non existent survivors ❤️ - drive train I'd stick with Shimano, because although you could go with the really high tech SRAM slx I don't think you need it for a trusty hard tail so XT or XTR is the way to go. And then for suspension I'd go with Öhlins, or Fox 34 performance - can't really go wrong with either :)
Definitely orange
you don't bury survivors
Riddle answer: you don’t bury the survivors cuz they’re still alive. You should put SRAM AXS on your bike with front brake routed through the head tube like Seth did so you can do bar spins.
the cushcore presses on the valve, so you can't get the air out of the tire. if you wanne lose your tire, lose the top of the valve and with something small, push the cushcore away from the valve, en then pssssssss :D and next time use the cushcore valves :D
No Survivor. Hahaha
No survivors! Fit a rockshox zeb? Drivetrain wise I love a 12spd sram
Riddle u don’t berry survivors  Marzokie bomber forks you should put on
U don’t bury the survivers. Ohlins.
Haha stick a fox 38 on it
riddel you can't beary evryone because eveyone died
Dude, the RockShox Zeb forks are absolutely incredible! They are so bad ass, and as for the drivetrain I would go for a DH Shimano Saint setup as something different. As for the survivors of a plane crash, I would personally let them consult a psychiatrist when they get home after their ordeal but if you want to bury them Matt then that's up to you.
You don't bury survivors, olins forks and wireless. Great build.
Get a new fox 36 fork in orange, I have a 2021 36 on my bike and i had a previous version on my Last bike and the new one is way way better
That siri joke was mint 😂😂😂
There are no survivors to the plane crash! Ohlins forks but you could try marzocchi
Riding vids

hey
You bury them wherever they lived. öhlins suspension and sram electret gears I hope that Consider me I think having a 1by would be better than the 3 by I have now but I Usually I don’t win stuff but Anyway staying positive.
@Matt Jones the answer to the riddle is there are no survivers so there no need to bury them.  By the way i love your vids and you inspired me to buy a hardtail and those parts would be great on it,
For the riddle: You don’t bury the survivors you bury the people who died.
You don't have to safe dead people
No one survived and you can’t Berry survivors and the fox orange forks would fit the colour of the frame perfectly and the sram xx1 eagle shifting group set 1x12 Dub boost 34z 170mm gold would also look sick on the bike
They’re is no survivors, get a sr sentour XCM and tourney 3/8 Jk, jk, but get some fox forks and get a 1 by 9/ idk the name of it right now butttt yea, LOVE YOUR VIDS!! Hope I win those handlebars and whatever else! By the way if I win you can dm me on Instagram or something because I follow u. Ok, thanks!!!
Loving the vids Matt, so happy your back, i reckon ohlins fork, shimano drivetrain and the answer to the riddle is that u don’t bury the survivors cos they’re alive👍❤️
Try out some blue DVOs
That riddle answer is you dont burry the survivers and put on the drivetrain from the rift zone carbon on the hardtail
You don’t bury survivors
And the riddle , no one survived so how would you bury the survivors. and why would u bury people who survived anyway. Also if they crashed into the water surely they would just sink to the bottom and be unrecoverable.
Riddle competition: the plane killed every and you can't bury people alive,  the bike needs some fox 38 forks on to match the orange frame and a shimano xtr drivetrain would be the dream😍🤙
There are no survivors they're all dead Forks: try marzocchi Drivetrain: Either shimano or try trp
U don’t bury survivors I say a marzuki fork and the eagle 12 speed
Hide at the bottom of the sea and use sram 9 speed Bluetooth gears
How did halo not tell you about new microspline driver? I just had mine custom made for me first set with there new driver!
You don’t bury survivors 😏 you should put on a marzocchi Z1 that red would look sick with the bike also I think you should go with a lesser known brand for the drive train, I think BOX would be pretty sick
Ohlins and xtr
You don't bury survivors. And honestly I think you need to go with something like Manitou
I'm pretty sure I would rather risk dingin the rim on a rock than messing with that pool noodle.
Riddle answer: the survivors in the plane are already buried in the ocean. Fork suggestion: rock shock SID ultimate  Drive drain suggestion: sram Nx eagle 1x12
There is no survivors of the plane crash! And any fork and drive train you choose is perfect ! Or let Becca pick them.

Giveaway riddle, the answer you're looking for is "you wouldn't bury survivors" however at 16:07 you said "plane crashes and kills everyone" so which is it Matthew ? Are there survivors (which we won't bury cos we're not MENTAL or did everyone die ?
Forks should be a fox  factory 38 pistachio  or a 36 root beer 160 it would look sick with the orange on the bike. Riddle: you don’t burry them cause they are alive and you should try a TRP drivetrain, they are rare but cool, if not then go for sram xx1 in gold to match the kashima coat on the fox forks.
Nobody dies so nobody is buried
Their was no survivors. Now please send me some bits for my build. All I have is a frame. Cheers me old mucker.
You cant berry survivors
Please put the ohlins fork on
Well the riddle makes no sense because you said a plane crashed and everyone died. But where do you bury the survivors. We don’t know if they are dead or alive because you said 2 things. I think you should put a set of ohlins and give it a box one prime nine groupest
its better to use the cushcore valve, because the opening of the valve is on the side of the valve and not the top (on the inside of the wheel), it will help :D
please put rockshox pike ultimate forks on the bike (the silver ones to match the cranks)
Ohlins fork all the way
The answer to the riddle is you don’t bury the survivors they’re under the sea Good drivetrain group set to get is the: SRAM XX1 eagle AXS DUB 12sp boost group set Forks to get: Fox 36 factory GRIP2 or Rockshox Lyrik Ultimate RC2

You don't bury the survivors, they're alive 😁😆, nice vid btw 🤛👌

you don’t bury. öhlins suspension. box drivetrain. cheers matt

or get RockShox RS1 RLC Solo air forks
DVO fork
hi if you take a fox 36 orange is gon a be cool
For the riddle: You wouldn't bury the survivors because they are alive, you should get a Fox 36 in orange because it matches the bike

Answer everyone dies there are no survivors
There’s no survivors
They're survivors so wouldn't be buried!
The bike would look better with black cranks
Answer to the riddle is that you don’t bury survivors. An Ohlins RFX M.2 Coil might be sick on that build. If you weren’t going with Ohlins I think a Marzocchi Bomber Z2 or Z1 coil would be an interesting choice.
Answer: a survivor is alive, you don't bury a living person😂
you dont bury survivors because they are alive
I’d say stick with shimano or get a Box drivetrain set. As for forks, maybe a DVO, Canecreek or MRP? I’d love to see something else than Rockshox/Fox/Marzocchi/Öhlins.
Answer to riddle: you don't bury the survivors since they are still alive. Forks: Fox 36 (or 38 if you want to go extreme and ride very gnarly trails). Drivetrain: SRAM AXS with golden cassete. (maybe also throw a kashima fox transfer dropper on there to match the forks and cassete)
nice riddle but we don't need to bury survivors mate 😂
You cant bury the survivors if there aren't any. And traditionally you don't bury people alive unless you are in the mafia.
I think orange four the sprocket
Hey Matt,  Answer to the riddle: no one is buried because you said ‘where would you bury THE SURVIVORS’  You should with out a doubt go with formula suspension. It’s the best looking fork around. And how about you give the trp drive train ago?? Great video!!
you can’t bury the survivors if no one lived
That orange 36 on the shelf behind you would make this an insane orange rocket

You do not bury the survivors, as they are not dead!
You can’t burry survivors!
Answer to riddle: you dont bury survivors  use the forx that are on there

Matt please put on a Sr Suntour Durolux on the bike! Survivors are still living, in this case there aren't any, so they don't need to be burried.  And you could put on a Shimano SLX or the m6000 deore setup.
Home country. Öhlins Saint breaks
riddle:You dont burry them becaus they are underwather.
The trick to Cush core is to constantly push the bead into the low part of the rim all the way around. So start opposite of the valve core and once it’s over the rim push it down between the Cush core and the middle of the rim.
The new fox 36 in orange to match
None of the survivors would be buried because they are still alive. Suggestions for a drive train I would maybe try box 1 prime 9 and I would also maybe put marzocchi z2 forks on like the other sanquentin. Keep up the great videos!

What about the orange fox factory 36 forks?
Riddle answer: you don’t bury people who survived 🤣 For the forks stick with rockshox and take the zeb ultimates. Guess for the drivetrain SRAM AXS (atleast thats what I would do if I could afford it)
You Don’t bury survivors. I do like the ohlins and I the colour will go better with the bike but when not try the rockshox zeb in 160mm and get some orange stickers or them

But If your sticking to your guns regarding no more riding fox then it has to be ohlins, as far as drivetrain its got to be the sram eagle also have found an orange casste that would look mint, KCNC  MTB Kassette Cassette for SRAM Eagle 12-Speed 9-52 Teeth orange.  Although if you are to choose ohlins forks then this cassette would be better sram xx1 eagle groupset in gold 👌https://www.mantel.com/uk/sram-xx1-eagle-upgradekit-groupset?spec%5B%5D=99&spec%5B%5D=15018&utm_source=google&utm_medium=shopping&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpMGx0_eb7AIVCbrtCh3YngJxEAkYBCABEgJwffD_BwE  Im absolutely stoked to see what this bike will eventually look like!!!
There are no survivors 😉
Riddle: you can't berry  the survivors Great to have u back
To answer the riddle - they are either unfound and left at the crash site. Or they are repatriated and buried in their home country.
Why would you berry the survivors
Riddle: you cant bury survivors also everyone died
riddle: you dont bury the survivors
They are survivors why would you bury them 😅😅
Why bury survivors if there aren’t any? And why would you bury survivors at all do you want to kill them too😅😅
Answer you don't beary suvivers because they are alive and do ohlins forks and do the SRAM gears.
Also put some Fox forks on there to go With the colour Orange to match the frame
Build lapse music is so soothing. Instantly I'm back to the excitement of the backyard build, sunny summer and Ben's giggles. Magic.
Nowhere because you can’t find them The fox orange forks would look sick And the gold s ram cassette would look super nice
Matt get Marazocchi bomber forks in black also matt there aren't suviere's and you don't burry people who are alive
2021 Marzocchi Bomber Z2 - Gloss Red for the forks. Sram GX Eagle for the drive train. you would you would bury them in the ocean or wear they came from. cheers mate have a good day.
Don’t bury the survivors
Your riddle you don't Bury survivors 😂😂😂
The country they came from or where the family what’s the to be put that is the answer
no suvivors get buryt !!!
You don't bury survivors... Try the Cane Creek Helm Coil. Stick with XT.
You don’t burry survivors
Go to pro bolt for titanium bolts , as long as you no the size an thread pitch
Well you don’t bury people that are alive and run try running the TRP drivetrain like Brendan fairlough, magura brakes would also be sick
Please get a reduced travel duel crown for the memes
Why would you bury a survivor? 😉
Riddle answer is No where because the survivors are alive
Answer to the riddle: you don’t bury survivors
You can’t berry survives mate and ohlins forks would be rad 🤟🏼
You don’t bury survivors Matt. You should get the ohlins rxf 36 and keep the shimano xt drivetrain.
Answer to the riddle  You don’t bury people who are alive
shram bluetooth and swap the hope breaks and for god sake shorten the the braided cables and put ohlins forks on it
The build lapse was subtle yet sweet
You wouldn’t need to bury survivors and everyone died ? I’d stick a set of mrp ribbons on it. Colour match would be sick
I love all of you vids and your the best rider
Cane Creek Helm fork maybe the coil version, match perfekt to e wings and have an insame Performance. I would try the new trp 12speed stuff und xtr or trp breaks, greezes from a german bike mech how build a lot of dream bikes ✌️
put a fox 38 on it
You don’t bury survivors they’re alive! I don’t know much about bike parts tho sorry :(
You don’t bury them they are in the ocean
The survivors didn’t died so you don’t bury them
You don't bury survivors 👍🚴‍♂️

Ohlins forks
USE THE FOX 36 IN THE BACKGROUND ON THE SHELF ON THE THAT BIKE

Riddle answer: you can’t bury the survivors and you should get a chrome drive chain
You don’t bury the survivors because they are still alive
16:16 I mean, nowhere only the dead people we Barry (or something), Surivide peoples nowhere :D
you don’t bury the survivors.....?
Well you can’t berry the survives cause they don’t know where the plane crashed. If I were you I’d definitely chose onlins fork and the wireless sram drivetrain setup because they are both sick.
Where the plane came from
U can’t bury survivers ahah
Riddle answer; everyone died, and you don’t bury survivors if there was any 😂
Its an Orange bike
Bury them at sea New fox 38s would be madness
You wouldn’t bury survivors ohlins forks and wireless drivetrain
Awesome upgrades. Hope  all orange brakes 🤙ohlins for sure. The bb mount has orange too, glad u went with the orange chainring.
Marzocchi Bomber Z1 GRIP Sweep would suit this bike
A red Marzocchi fork would look so good on that bike.
Keep the shimano drivetrain and put on a fox 38 fork and you dont bury people that are alive
You don’t bury survivors  fox 36 like the old san
You can’t bury people alive
You won’t bury them because you said bury the survivors and they can’t be buried and hope breaks and fox forks 👍🏻👌🏻
Just put Halo Vortex’s on my Jeffsy, love em. Noticeably stiffer and the hub is nice.
There are no survivors
No one as they are buried in the sea

You don’t hurry them because there at the bottom of the ocean also I think you should go with ohlins forks and the wireless sram drive train
Think some orange fox factory forks would match and look sick Matt
Riddle answear there are no survivors and you don’t bury them

You should get a cane creak fork

S2 components always out of stock because they send them all to Matt 😂
Honestly a absolute black black chain ring would be nice
Sr suntour axion you don't bury survivors
Orange
❌There is no survivors there all dead❌
Orange
Forks I’d say RockShox pike ultimate because it would match the cranks and the fighting and stuff on gusset, it would also stand out
U don’t berry services
u should not bury survivors
Fox 38
uberbikecomponants have some titanium bolts in loads of colours!
The answer to the question is you cant burry them they Are under water
You dont bury survivors, also didnt you say everybody was killed just before you asked about burying survivors?! Get an Ext Era fork. Nice and bling
You don’t burry survivors fox forks
Orange
yes siri i am 12
I’ll actually buy you some more buildlapse music. C’mon Benjamin....🤦🏻‍♂️
Love the video
EPIC
If everyone dies in the plane crash, there are no survivors. But you said "where do you bury the survivors." Also, if someone dies in a plane crash and there body is somehow recovered. You would probably take the body back to the family and it would be buried where ever the family chose. For the drivetrain you should put on the Sram Eagle AXS. Its a wireless drivetrain so you can do barspins without worrying about the wires up front tangling to much. For the fork,  Marzocchi Bomber Z1 because they have the best value suspension.
However, there are no bikes in stock anywhere :/ Anyone else have the same problem?
You should do a downhill bike build
Now I know to never buy a cushcore
You do not Barry sevivers
Sick video mate. 🤙🏼🤙🏼👊🏻👊🏻
Hey broh wanna make a deal put videos on hardtail and get more views Deal
That san Quentin is lit love the colour 🔥 Getting a san Quentin 1 for Christmas does anyone have any tips on what to upgrade or just overall stuff to look out for?
I got a new (well second hand) full suspension  bike and it’s so good
I’m so happy you put MTB parts in the title as i would have assumed that you would have put a pair of skate trucks on it and some envy union bars
do a riding video
Thanks for this really helped
can you get a dh bike please ...? it would be so sick ;)
Matt: has bike stand Also Matt: puts bike on the floor Love it Edit: think you should put a RockShox pike ultimate coz it is stealthy and probably the best performing trail fork on the market AND the survivors are already in the water so u can’t bury them
Sick Love you Matt
I was watching the original dream build playlist and I get the notification for this lol.
You should do a collab with Sam Pilgrim
Yess Matt saw you at Woburn yesterday for the first time it was very wet and I’m pretty sure you were on the sanquentin 3 and I don’t know how your bike was so clean yet you weren’t 😂❤️🤟🤟🤟
