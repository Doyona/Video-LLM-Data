13:23 okay well what if he was playing a role the whole time (country look) and only then showed his true self (rock and roll look)
As someone whos dyexic that website IS hell
i was convinced the thumbnail was the guy from three days grace and I thought the cowboy hat version was him trying to go country
thank you for this gem, I had to track it back down and show my mom today to help explain all the conspiracy theory background about him, primarily him being a serial k*ller😂
If Brooks had just presented Gaines as a character project for a movie from the get-go and been a touch comedic about it, I think audiences would have been more forgiving. Though I'm not sure where the idea that he was genuinely trying to fool people came from if the album was literally titled Garth Brooks in the Life of Chris Gaines. The contents are on the cover, brother
Danny u gotta revisit w kj appa and mr fantasy
9:39 i think the man music video was kinda like this 😭 or how many people didn't realise taylor swift also played the black haired girl in the you belong with me music video?
you NEED to make a video about mr fantasy
7:31 Garth is a name in the Alpha and Omega movies
Has anything good happened to Chris Gaines😭😭😭
Imma act like my pfp isn't what it is. If you know you know he has an alter ego. 😭
Why does his alter ego look like Onision? 🥴
This was for a movie that ended up being canceled. It wasn’t Garth Brooks trying to pass off an alter ego. Really disingenuous video
Ngl I actually really like the song
The “Behind the Music” Episode is the funniest fucking thing. Also proves that Brooks is in fact a serial killer
Its giving JoJo siwa
Think ziggy stardust and David Bowie..
Wow ..im way too old for this channel ...I remember this lije yesterday
the artist formerly known as Garth Brooks
PUT THE DAWGS AWAY 6:04
I find it so interesting that out of all things he did this, and out of all the places to choose it was Brisbane Australia? Honestly surprised he didn't go for Sydney 😂 also hilarious that he made his alter ego 5 years younger than him
Well i guess he tried to take a page from the david bowie book of implementing characters in their musical art but without maybe the foresight required to pull it off…
And everyone said “Just sing Thunder Rolls and go away, bro”
Bro you’re gonna look 20 when you’re 50 if you’re already 30
TBH this would totally be accepted today. While artist aren’t really tied to a genre of music anymore. If an artist did this and made it actually seems like art not a publicity stunt it would definitely work. Imagine Kendrick Lamar creating an alter ego like “Cleetus John” a southern born country singer. I don’t think Kendrick is a good example but someone could do it.
Bro made his own first edgy ocs
Dude, it was a character for a movie idea that was in the early stages of production. He wasn’t trying to fool anyone. The movie fell through but he had already done the music for it. So he released it. Again, he wasn’t trying to “trick” anyone. In fact I had that CD and it actually says on the back “the life of Chris Gaines by Garth Brooks”.
I remember this.  It was so very...late 90's.  😂
Garth Brooks continued to serve Bud Light at his bar in Tennessee after Dylan Mulvaney did her ad, and when asked why, he said everyone is welcome at his bar and diversity is important  So GB is always gonna be cool to me idc
He released that album on my birthday. Nice
honestly i dont think it's that deep or crazy. there are a lot of 'fictional' musicians that have lore and stuff. this one just happened at a weird time
2:38 thats onision
'His hair is falling over his face, he's half in shadow...'  Danny have you never heard of emo music
Garth Brooks, the Kool Keith of Country
It was both.  It was very confusing everyone knew; it wasn't a secret but Chris Gains & Garth Brooks were '2 different artists". It was a weird, more simple time
john 3:16, luke 13:3, james 2:17, ephesians 2:8-9 have a good day!
Garth Brooks is really big here in Ireland, people LOVE him so it's insane hearing about him outside of my country
Funny, my parents were the biggest Garth Brooks fans, and when they talked about why no one listened to him anymore, it was because he was divorced. They failed to mention anything about Chris Gaines, the first retirement, and then the divorce. Granted I was like 7, so they might not have thought I'd understand it (I also found out as an adult that Penelope from the Amanda show was actually Amanda, never caught that)
Danny letting us know he never watched "Wayne's World"
Darth Brooks
He does say fremiliar
Well, Garth brooks has been hiding bodies all over the country
This is a bit different obviously but it kind of reminds me of this book I read in high school about an actor who's playing the role of a serial killer and he's a method actor and he ends up getting way too into it to the point where he believes that he's possessed by the ghost of the serial killer and ends up becoming the serial killer lol
Garth brooks walked so Mr fantasy could run
Garth looks exactly like tom segura 😂 tom talked so much crap now he literally is him
Everyone knew he did it and it wasnt a secret..guess ya actually had to be born to know.
Chris gaines just looks like Nikki sixx
Truly the Paul zimmer of 1999
Garth is his middle name btw. His first name is... no joke, Troyal
David Bowie did this a few times, but it worked for him.
Beyonce did the same. Heck put ted hair and a beard on David carridene and it looks like another kung fu tv star.
Chris Gaines looks like he was based on Trent Reznor. Not the music just the look and hairstyle
Never heard the name Garth? For me at least,  Garth from Wayne's world with Wayne and Garth is the first Garth I think of when someone says the name Garth.
Garth Brooks is a suspected serial killer.
The biggest shock of this video is learning that you're older than me
Is he cosplaying as Chris angel?
Now make a video about the bodies.
im not  from north america so ive never heard about this story but man, its good as fuck, its his OC
Yo my guitar teacher told me about this literally yesterday
this is, to me, an even more insane version of smth like damon albarn doing his personal music, music w/ blur, and music for gorillaz. chris gaines is simply garth's 2D, and i respect it.
Say what you want, but Chris Gaines' magic show "Mind Freak" is damn good!😅
Everyone says he looks like Onison but us old heads will say he was pulling a Trent Reznor cosplay, when NIN was at their peak popularity.
5 yrs old in 99!? I thought this guy was like 17 LMAO
Missed opportunity for Darth Brooks
bro I'm five minutes into this and you know zero about music. i'm actually offended you think of chip gaines and not steve gaines and you have no idea who trisha yearwood is. you're out of your depth my man
The image in the thumbnail lowkey looks like onision lmao
I remember when I was a kid I loved Garth.  I remember seeing that album cover and someone explaining to me that he was just tired of country and tried  making pop music.  Never thought twice about it other than well that’s dumb
Where are the bodies Garth ?
Garth Brooks might be Europe's Robbie Williams. Apparently super big in the US, while I'm not sure we've ever heard of him.   When you were showing his most famous songs, not only did I not recognize the one you chose, I expected it to be If I Were A Rich Man. Because that's literally the only song I remember hearing him sing, that time he was on The Muppets Tonight. Which incidentally was about him branching out from singing his usual songs. So maybe it was a Chris Gaines performance, and I've never actually heard Garth Brooks at all.
He said he wanted to be in a movie. Somebody asked him if he wanted to play the good guy, he said no he wanted to be the bad guy kill people
I remember seeing temmie (yes undertale temmie) in the reply section of one of the comments idk if the comments deleted but I can’t find it anywhere.
Garth is onision. Confirmed.
Yeah that was a really weird stunt. He never tried to hide that he was Garth Brooks though
7:30 sad. I’m old. Party on Wayne
0:37 No. No one outside the US (and somehow Ireland) knows Garth Brooks!
100% he wanted Chris Gaines to be a thing, like his “Michael Jordan plays baseball” because he thought he could dominate everywhere.  Then a producer heard his music and said “look, the only way we’re releasing this is if you still put Garth Brooks on there or it won’t sell”.
The whole persona was created for a movie and he was supposed to play the main character. The video was to introduce Chris Gaines and it was supposed to tie into the movie somehow. It was so poorly done and there was such a huge backlash, that the movie got scrapped. Interesting concept that just didn't work. I'm quite a bit older, but I really liked GB when I was in high school, and even then I thought it was a cool concept.
You said PLANED. Not PLANNED. 😅
He lowkey looks like onision
Hopefully you’re not that stupid. Nothing was hidden. There was no scam. This was an intentional alter ego project. You should do your research
PLEASE DO A VIDEO OF TJE TIKTOK MAN WOTH SKELETON MASKS THEY BE YELLING OUT GANG GANG
The way my dumbass clicked on this thinking itd be about Onision because I cant tell emo boys apart
Me being so old (38) that I actually bought the Chris Gaines album and kinda dug it 😂 I was a Indiana girl and grew up on garth Brooks! Him and Reba were my childhood ❤
Childish Gambino covered Lost in You on Triple J and it might be one of his best songs. It's very well written.
I'd guess his fan base wasn't a fit for the new music and look. E.g., Beyoncé's Sasha Fierce is an easier cross-over. Maybe?
11:26 WHAT IN THE MUMBLE RAP IS HE EVEN SAYING
OMG ... Millennials are so dumb
We didnt find out til later that Chris was Garth.. People were a little pissed when the truth was told. Maybe its a parody of what was going on or going to happen to 90s rock groups. Maybe it was a spell of majik look at all of the groups that dies from the 90s early 2000s. Yeah think about it
My memory of the Chris Gaines thing is Garth Brooks was kinda going out of style so everyone assumed he was trying to reinvent himself.
Kid, please watch Wayne's World!
" i like that" - Giraffe Cooks  Just here for any one who remembers when Tom wasn't a douch and YMH was actually pretty good over ten years ago now, damn. He Chris Gaines'd himself into a rich trust fund kid that was there inside all along an no one liked it, oh the irony.
this is so funny because I remember my parents listening to Garth Brooks/Chris Gaines when I was a kid (I am a year older than you Danny).
Listen to the dance and you will understand. He is an amazing vocalist
You never heard the name Garth? Have you never watched Wayne's World? Lol
Dixon dallas
ah, gu brooks, my favorite singer (haha get it because one of the chapters in the video was spelled wrong hahahaha)
Garth brooks wasn’t on top 40 bc Billboard Top 40 generally didn’t include country. They focused more on pop and hip hop. The Chris Gaines song made it bc it wasn’t country. But there are other methods of gauging successful musicians aside from Billboard Top 40c hence why we know that Garth Brooks is one of the best selling musicians.
danny... have you never seen wayne's world?!!
... I was born in the 80s.  My mom was a brooks fan and neither she nor her friends actually thought this was an attempt to present a literally different person.
Here's a fun fact! One day while I was headed to my barn there was a video being filmed, some sort of music Video  I learned a day later that Garth Brooks *Daughter* was filming a music video at my barn  The place is here in Canada, Ontario  And it's called Montesola Farms!   So...I got to see his daughter I didn't know it was her and the only reason I know of Garth is because of this video
Where are the Bodies Garth?!!!
It’s so crazy cause both me and my mom are obsessed with Garth brooks….
Gotta watch the battle between comedian Tom Segura & Garth Brooks.  Also, on Tom Segura's netflix show, he plays Garth Brooks. It's a hilarious saga 😂😂
This is 30 years old. 🤔
Wait I know that Chris gains song lol
I thought that was Chriss Enel in the thumbnail lol
He's just his oc
mate, he wasn't trying to hide, he was dipping into another genre. it was well known at that time that he was doing it. No sneaking around lol .. I know I was there
Brooks isn’t the only artist who did this. Remember Hootie & the Blowfish? You know Darius Rucker? Same person. In the 90’s you couldn’t really cross music genres. Country music artists were country music artists. Rock artists were rock artists. You couldn’t be country pop. You’re comparing a lot of things to things of today rather than comparing to the 90’s. SNL… You’re telling me that you don’t know SNL music artists are lip-sync… 😅 Hate to break it to you… 😂
5:57 🙄🤦‍♀️ not the pyramid hands while sitting in an 8 pointed star smh 🥴 these morons actually believe that everyone is a blind puppet smh
I know music is subjective but HOW is this guy one of the highest selling muscians?!?! its like really bad
14:39 It was going to be a "Final Destination" movie with Chris being the only survivor.
It was all for a movie that never got made. He tried to jump the gun and start building the character before having the movie green lit.
Garth Brooks is actually Rex Hamilton
Goes undercover as a "popular rockstar" yet only makes emo pop?
Garth Brooks' brother was our school principal and when he retired the nephew became a teacher at our school
The Clark Kent effect...
Trump needs to start exploring an alternate identity at this point 😂
Everytime i hear the name Chris Gaines i always think of a fitness bro for some reason
I don't know if I'd say Garth Brooks with every one of the biggest musicians in the world. Play the biggest musician in The honky tonk bars.
Chris Gaines is actually Onision
I was born in 1988 and Garth Brooks was so big growing up that he was like a mythical figure. Everyone loved him and even people who didn't like country would listen to Garth Brooks. My older brother is a metalhead and nineties rap guy and he listened to Garth Brooks.  He dis this at the height and nobody liked it.
Half my dads side of the family loves Garth brooks it’s crazy
I was thinking in the back of my head that Chris Gaines kind of looks like a character that TylerSherwinMagic would pull off, so I was pleasantly surprised when at 4:34 in the video it says he was Australian 😂
I thought the alter ego was onision lmao
11:41  it looks more like he’s the remaining member of a 2000’s emo band but the other members died in an accident so now it’s just Gaines
I think he wanted to do a goofy side project as an experiment, but the public are all a bunch of doofuses.
Garth Brooks wanted to start acting more. He created a character to play. That's really the entire story.
He eventually just made a lot of whiny, wimp music that wouldn't have passed under his 'country' branding, and thought it would fit in with the 'rock' crowd.
When all this happened, it was so weird. Garth was an incredibly big deal back then. He was all over the place. When this Chris Gaines thing happened, I just remember everyone seemed to know it was Garth Brooks, but was too confused to say it out loud lol
“We have Trent Reznor at home” lookin’ ass
Chris gaines looks like Onision
I grew up on Unspeakable, I could not believe he’s making this type of content, ew.
I remember this, I don't think anyone at the time was confused about who Chris Gains was. People mostly thought it was stupid.
Bro just wanted to be emo
Did you hear about the theory that Garth Brooks is actually a serial grapist... Now I've heard that Chris Gaines was a 'sex addict'...eek. Apparently there was an offence in every town he played in on the same night he played... Might be worth exploring I'm not sure if this is what you're content covers... But it's a thing.
Think of all the ones that werent caught
I js posted a lil drawing of him :33
Everyone who's famous plays many roles. They're all deceivers trying to ateal human souls. This character got caught, that's all
If he actually released five albums, to make up a discography from which his previous 'greatest hits' album from decades ago was supposedly pulled, that would genuinely be diabolical.  😂
As a Brooks fan myself, this was the weirdest point in his career. What was he thinking
This feels like Garth was trying to do a Goncharov before tumblr was around to take the whole game to its most illogical conclusion.
no cause lost in you is a good song though. like childish gambino literally covered it
When I was a kid, people always told my dad he looked like Garth Brooks. It’s SO funny seeing Chris Gaines because he looks nothing like my dad. I guess Garth succeeded in looking different enough?
honestly i think its pretty cool, its performance art and i think a fun way to experiment with new genres especially since he was open about it being him on the album
Forget garth brooks we need a video about robert
The Chris Gaines album is solid…🤷‍♂️
Temu add 😅 7:16
You have never heard of the first name Garth... As in the character that Dana Carvey played in Wayne's World?! 🤦🏻‍♂️ How on earth are you a pop culture influencer?! 🤪
C c.
My alter-ego has 115 platinum albums you've never heard of and hes the World Sex Champion of '95-'02 and '08 when hes not saving the world in his super spy job.
Woah Danny is older than me weirrrddd  Just because he looks perpetually 23
I love that I get to tell my mom about her favorite country singer
I might just be stupid, but i actually had no idea Danny was Fox SZN. To be fair, I never really looked at his face long enough to realize they were the same person lol
I had no idea I was missing out on the Garth Brooks Extended Universe lore
The Chris Gaines song was NOT his most popular song. It appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 because that's a pop chart and it was a pop song. All Garth's #1 hits appeared on Billboard's country charts. On the rare event that a country song appears on the hot 100 it's usually because it's not a real country song. Like Old Town Road.  Also, if I remember correctly, he was totally trying to pull the wool over our eyes. I don't remember "Garth Brooks" being in the title of the album at all. It may have been retroactively renamed to that later on after it had become a meme (long before memes were a thing). I wouldn't trust a bio on anyone's official website, it's obviously gonna be biased.
I mean authors do it too - like JK Rowling and Robert Galbraith.
Yeah we know its just another one of your clones danny 5 years old my ass
7:46 cloyster? The Pokémon? /j
Garth brooks in the streets, chris gaines in the sheets
I think he wanted to do a ziggy stardust thing and just absolutely whiffed it.
He is definitely a serial killer- rumors are true
Chris Gainz LMAO ill call myself... MAX POWER! Fixer Upper lol I was thinking Simpsons His disguise is giving AI give me an emo picture of Onision "I'm Miley Cyrus" Slim Shady is furious right now My inner emo 14 year old didnt know about any of this I'm DYING every time he pops up with the emo hair. Gerard Way who?
I thought this was onision wtf
Garth Brooks was HUGE justtt before music downloads and the iTunes Store got really popular. I think he was the last really big “album-selling” music artist because people started to buy individual songs in the early 2000’s. And now streaming
It's like starting a new account in league or another video game with a ranked ladder, or restarting Skyrim until you realize you're just playing a stealth archer again  Smurfing is fun
did he just want to be trent reznor for a while 😭
Garth needs to tell us where the bodies are
i have never heard of garth brooks in my life
Man i love Robert everyone say thank you Robert
This is like the substance
Chris Gaines was a musical guest on SNL and Garth hosted
I think what's lost in all of this, is that the Chris Gaines album is actually pretty good. Was the execution cringey and weird from a marketing standpoint? absolutely, total meme legend, but the album itself is really good, i honestly wish he could've made more albums outside of his country wheelhouse
cannot stop fucking laughing i love you
It’s funny because Chris Gaines sounds like a realer name than Garth Brooks…
0:10 I had no idea that it was you to be honest, and I just thought that he looked a little familiar😭
I’m happy Danny is taking the time he needs to put focus on his family and everything, BUT I MISS THE VIDEOOOS 😭😭  I hope it’s been a good journey into fatherhood and I wish him the best for now and the future, the whole family BUT STIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLL
never heard the name garth before? have you never seen waynes world?
I cannot see “Chris Gaines” as anything other than Onision because of that stupid ass photo I’m sorry
why does chris gaines kind of look like a poorly drawn trent reznor
I remember this, what a dork! 😂
2:28 this dude straight up looks like Onision with a flavor saver
Chris Gaines looks like Onision....
I think i still have the chris gaines single on a mini cd
Why would they have this detailed backstory if the original album release was titled “Garth Brooks as Chris Gaines,” it’s all a lie. This was him 100 trying to pass himself off as a completely different person. I remember when Chris Gaines released his first single and I remember when people discovered it was actually Garth Brooks.
The original release made no mention of Garth Brooks, nor did I ever hear of a movie until recently. This seems to be stories created later to save face.
Had absolutely no clue Garth Brooks existed before this video.
No they’re lying about everything, with him being #1, George Strait, Johnny cash, Willie Nelson, etc. will always be better than Garth Brooks, EVEN BROOKS AND DUNN IS BETTER THAN HIM
How have I never heard of Garth Brooks
this feels like twitter rebranding as X
I remember this. The first that I heard of it went, "Did you know Garth Brooks put out a rock album?" I never got the impression he was trying (maybe hoping, but not trying) to fool people. 5:39
I was just uh. Wondering how these disguises didn't work. Like. Those are two completely different people. Then I remembered I am face blind ✌️😭
Play friends in low places at ANY bar in the South and everybody in the damn building is screaming the chorus
Danny being 31 is not something i was ready to hear today
I think hes a funny dude and his whole "side project" is actually really good he has impressive range. I don't like country but his chris stuff is actually something I can dig and i get him acting like a different person cause going from country to soft isn't usually appreciated by country fans.
9:45 not quite Taylor swift but her boyfriend at the time did help her write a couple of songs under a pseudonym!
I mean, as someone who's very picky with the quality, mix and creativity (very sensitive ears, I hate high frequences), gotta admit the songs are not that bad- very basic, but well mixed and I wouldn't be bothered if I heard this in the background at someone's party. Sounds like a comepletely legit album that would play on country/pop radios.  It is absoluelty hilarious to me that he has this mega dark, mary sue background story and looks like he grabbed the emo costume pack at the party store right before performing. AND THEN HIS SONGS ARE SO MUCH MORE COUNTRY THAN YOU'D EXPECT- THERES NOTHING HARD ABOUT IT it's amazing, I love it
Matched with a dude on hinge that kinda looks like "chris gaines" and i'm so entirely sussed out
That was supposed to be rock 'n' roll? None of the songs in this video sounded like it.
You're a great storyteller, and this is quite the story too
YOU WERE FOX SZN
Crisp Grains
EWEWEW HE LOOKS LIKE ONISION
Robert aka Dave Franco
UWU i hate my life
He did say in the 90s he wanted to try his hand at film directing so....
I was alive and VERY into country at the time this was happening, and this is the first I've ever heard of that movie lolol
Tracy Morgan roasting him on SNL right before he did his musical number will always live in my head rent free 🤣🤣🤣
The bit about looking up where the name Garth comes from is perfect, because after that I was thinking, that's exactly how I feel anytime I look something up on Google. I type my question out and then the results that I get, I'm left with thinking, what is this, none of this has anything to do with what I asked.
Ong so hilarious 😅😅
Missed opportunity for “Barth Grooks”
How f**king weird was this?!? Like even David Bowie had Ziggy Stardust but we all knew it was him, and David made it known as so. But, the Chris Gaines thing….so f**king strange - you’re telling me this man DOESN’T have bodies buried in his back yard?!?😂😂😂
One day you hire a wedding photographer, and despite their digital colour portfolio they insist in shooting large format daguerreotype
Garth sounds like the name of a Fire Emblem character, probably is actually in one of the games..
am i crazy or does the beginning of the song at 5:53 sound like billie bossa nova by billie eilish
I somehow just realized that you’re slightly wider in all of your 2d2f thumbnails
It's funny how this video was inspired by your trying to make a viral tik tok song video and that was inspired by your pretending to be someone else video which was inspired by your troy Zimmer video
I wasn’t expecting the fictitious manager to be a woman for some reason 😂
Taylor swift already did that it’s called the you belong with me music video 🤣
Danny, I am 43 and my daughter and I watch you together.😊 As a teenager during this time in Garth's life, I can tell you that Garth is trying so hard to rewrite history.  At the time, Garth LIVED as Chris Gaines.  Nobody ever mentioned "a movie" back then.  He wore that wig full time and refused to answer to "Garth."  It was confusing because Garth was "method acting" but acting like THE PUBLIC was crazy. The fact that they've rewritten history and lied about this fake movie and "the public wasn't ready..." 😂 We weren't ready to accept Garth selling us Chris Gaines was a real person. That wig must've squeezed his brain too tight! Great video, Danny, my daughter and I love your content! 🎉  Danny, I am 43 and my daughter and I watch you together.😊 As a teenager during this time in Garth's life, I can tell you that Garth is trying so hard to rewrite history.

Garth Brooks? Never heard of him. We don't get many Cowboys in Rochdale. It's hard being a cowboy in Rochdale. Spurs don't fit right on clogs.
1:23 It’s actually Elvis Presley 😭
Reminds me of Coach Bolton's crisis.  "Garth Brooks we know it's you."
Thanks for making me google “worst things that can happen to you in life” I have now developed super anxiety
it seems like he was attempting to copy savage garden - ripped off darren hayes' look, the music sounds similar, even down to chris gaines being from brisbane which is where savage garden were from. i think he just really liked truly madly deeply and created a whole alter ego about it
I think about this all the time.
O7 Garth Brookes and Hello Chris Gaines
The first article has so many spelling and grammar errors, such as misspelling ‘weird’ and writing ‘mediums’ instead of ‘media’
chris gaines looks like onision 😭
we know theres no robert, danny. we know its you danny
Chris looks like Onision.
My favorite thing about the Chris Gaines thing was the album photo where he’s wearing black and white skin tight leggings. As much as he hid his face, he had everything else all out there.
My dogs name is Garth and I can’t stop thinking of my dog when you say brookes name
Garth Brooks being the #1 best selling solo artist is technically true, but also incredibly misleading. Wal Mart sold a bundle of all of his albums for like $30, which even back in the 90s and early 00s was a crazy good deal. The misleading thing is that for each bundle sold, they counted it as like 8 album sales, which grossly inflated his numbers.  If you disregard the bundle sales (or count them as one album), I doubt he'd even be in the top 10.
Garth as Chris Gaines reminds me of Ben Stiller as Zoolander.
3:57 i’ve never seen drew and danny together with anybody else… hmm
No cause i genuinely thought Fox SZN was a completely different person than Danny but just sounded the same until I was talking to my friend about him and she went “you know Fox SZN is just Danny in a goatee and sunglasses” and I was like “WHAT”
14:42 a series of unfortunate events
Can I just say, among 4900+ other comments and a year after posting, that Garth Brooks makes the worst fucking music I've ever heard in my life.
Chris Gaines looks like Onision and it’s making me uncomfortable
Im unwilling to accept garth isn't up to something shady. Or at minimum hes a jackass but he gives off vibes of hiding something. Him trying to be relatable or laugh just shows how impossibly fake he is too
Guess Danny started doin a Gaines
Lost in you will always be a good song ❤
That Chris Gaines album was good though my mom had it 😂❤
14:45 why did i laugh
2:19 am i the only one who noticed him spell “weirdest” wrong
The whole album sounds like a Steve Conte album. It's pretty good
I did not expect Danny to be only 8 years older than me, i thought he was like 40 or something
11:07 THAT BASS LICK THHOOO!!!!
Danny i just want you to know this is one of my favorite videos on YouTube
i mean, the beatles did a similar thing with sgt. pepper
Does anyone know the name of the song that plays at 3:17 ?? Please help.
“Undercover boss look” killed me💀💀💀
What’s odder yet is his first name is Troyal. Troyal Garth Brooks
3:16 yo whats the backround music here it kinda goes hard
any one else find it funny that Garth is an 'emo name', and Chris is a 'country name'.
Chris Gaines looks like Garth Brooks cosplaying as Onision.
Holy shit, the disguise Danny had legitimately looked like someone else.
Bro needed a new dust filter for his Hoover Max Extract Pressure Pro Model 60
Garth had an alter ego?!!!?
Dude was more Bruno than Borat. ( do not google Bruno).
he released it on my birthday 1999. I didnt ask for it.
I remember hanging out at my best friends house after school in like 3rd grade singing “friends in low places” on repeat on her Bratz karaoke machine . Good times.
14:30 - to be entirely fair, as soneone who knows a LITTLE about rock stsrs and pop artists especially in the 80/90s, that backstory is pretty believable. There were multiple major tragedies like a plane crash that killed a ton of musicians, tons of exploitation, an emphasis on the horizontal tango and spicy liquids/solids/injections, etc.  If the character is supposed to be a rock star aging out and making s greatest hits album, having some terrible stuff is closer to the norm than it is to an exception.
i love the music tbh
i have an uncle garth
Garth's actual first name is weirder, actually
Garth Brooks isn’t the first to pull off this alter ego stuff . Writers like Stephen King and Critic Rex Reed did it before they were unmasked . People don’t do it to establish a new career or re invent themselves . They do it because they want to stretch and have some fun .
I am now fully on team there was never a movie. At the point you would be doing *that* level of marketing, the movie is either in final edits or done. So the fact a movie was never released, either it was so bad they would rather take the financial hit of it not making any money at all - or there was no movie.
I thought for sure you were going to recommend Young Face for a collab
im in chronic wrist pain, i'm chris james-- i mean gaines
Hannah Montana did release an album called "Meet Miley Cyrus," and it came WIITH the Hannah Montana CD. (I have it.) SO TRY AGAIN, DANNY.
This reminds me of The Network, a band that emerged in a cloud of mystery in 2003 that everyone immediately recognized as the members of Green Day and their touring musicians, but they denied and denied and denied that they were the same people, even though one of The Networks song is just "Wilhelm Fink" (The lead singer) talking for the majority of it about living in Oakland and trying to get weed even though the band was supposed to be from Sweden, and that is one of the most Green Day things you could write a song about. It wasn't really serious, just a fun rabbithole to go down 20 years later.
Hardly anyone outside the u.s. listened to or bought garth brooks albums, he wasn't even close to the #1 best selling solo artist of all time that's why he added the "in the u.s." part. Elvis alone sold over a billion albums worldwide.
As someone who lived in the same town as Garth at one point (he was SUPER nice) & obviously grew up in the south - I can confirm he is a country music GOAT. The Chris Gaines thing is bizarre- but Garth Brooks has never really "recessed" in popularity among country music. Also while his honkytonk music is more known in the general public (if they even know any country music haha), his bluegrass/folk style, particularly in older albums, is phenomenal. I *highly* recommend listening to the album Scarecrow. My personal favorite song, which is on Scarecrow album, is called Pushing Up Daisies. I'll post the chorus lyrics here, maybe it'll encourage a listen of the album from someone! c; They're simple, but beautiful ^^ "There's two dates in time that they'll carve on your stone And everyone knows what they mean What's more important is the time that is known And that little dash there in between That little dash there in between"
Do any Greg’s know when Danny stopped saying “What’s up, Greg!? Welcome back to another video of [insert something random here]!”
What’s even weirder is I never realized they were the same person until like… college. I was an emo kid and never listened to country. I thought Chris Gaines music was fine, usually a bit corny but I enjoyed it enough.
Girth Books
Biggest musical artist of all time , never heard of him in my 40years on this planet
WAIT WE NEED A FOX SZN AND CHRIS GAINES COLLAB
garth made oc lore of his alter ego and everything bro did that for himself 😭
can someone actually explain how they shot the SNL thing
It definitely felt like he was trying pull a fast one on us and the movie was just a coverup story when he was found out. I thought he was overwhelmed by his success and really wanted to leave it behind. Either way, it was stupid and creepy.
Barf Brookes?
rewatching this after a while. why does chris gaines look like neon vortex in the music video
It’s in his documentary that his wife loves his Chris album as he got to do some new music complete from scratch. Alter ego ended up his try to go method for the film that never got made. And they go more into it if you ever wanted to learn more about his career rise and up through the film and afterwards.
You make a real song of “ I’m really Danny but you’ll never tell”  👇
I wasn’t even expecting an Austin Butler name thrown and it caught me off guard, and I thought it was funny and true. Why did he just continue to be Elvis after Elvis??
"one of the most famous person in the world" you mean in the US...
I remember thinking in high school that Garth Brooks was lame and not believable. I had a feeling his trajectory was beginning to go into descent & this Chris Gaines schtick was an attempt to shock his fans to jazz upwardly this descent. But it was just sad and pathetic.Go away, Garth Boy.
What about earl dibbles jr ??
I remember where I worked when I was 17, who I was dating, brand names that everyone wore, and unfortunately…….THIS. It was cringe before we knew how to describe things as ‘cringe’. 🤦🏻‍♀️
Green Day also did this in the 2000s. They made another band called "The Network" and pretended to not be Green Day and even talked trash about themselves lol
0:02 This is how I find out that silly song I saw in an edit one time was made by Danny? 😭
Damn I mean idk Chris Gaines music was actually good LOL
14:42 You could also say it was, a series of unfortunate events.
I LOVE FIXER UPPER
Didn't the Beatles/ Sergeant peppers lonely hearts band do this
This is click bait and completely fabricated. Garth Brooks didn't hide behind Chris Gaines. He publicly announced he was making a rock record and chris gaines was his new stage name. Make no mistake, though. Garth brooks did not try to disguise that
Yeah, at the time no one ever heard of the movie. It felt like Garth was going through an emotional phase in midlife, and then backtracked to say “Nonono, it was for a MOVIE!” I had the cd, and we all knew it was him, but it was bizarre how he denied it and seemed to tantrum about it. Garth just wanted to try his hand at something new, and it didn’t work.
To Garth, the original 'It was just a prank bro'.
Holy crap he mentioned Garth brooks   Danny gonzoles mentioned Garth brooks  My life is complete
I feel like that’s like if the Beatles said they were actually Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and pretended to have no idea who the Beatles were and gaslit everyone. They created it as an alter ego to escape the title of the Beatles, but they didn’t gaslight everyone dayum 😳
My mom has this whole conspiracy that Garth Brookes is Michael Jordan
i thought that was onision
If you look up what Trent Reznor looked like around when Nine-Inch-Nails broke big, you'll see EXACTLY where Brooks got the look for Chris Gaines.  And if you listen to whatever one-hit-wonders were being touted as "much better than all that industrial NOISE the stupid sad kids are listening to these days!" you'll find where the sound for his music came from.
Rip Garth Brooks you would've loved oc writing
Is that piano in the background of 3:55 dance with the devil by immortal technique 😭
As someone who was a teenager while this was happening, it was obvious that it was a joke.  He wasn’t being serious.
The fact that this dude thinks that he was the first one to come up with an alter ego and try a different genre is kind of crazy because lots of people have been doing it at that point not to mention Our Queen Hannah Montana and even David Bowie himself along with very famous country music star Hank Williams
For a second there I thought you were talking about the guy from Staind you know the lead singer in that very popular 90s alt-rock band turns out he left stained and then became a country music star and has been a country music star ever since, and I only know that because my mom saw him live once in Vegas and he was so high the the concert was so bad that everyone left like halfway through and then she followed up like now he's a country music star
Nga Look Like Chris Angel
11:00 ever heard of a quick change
It’s giving neon vortex
I thought that was Onision
VH1 put out that fake documentary when it's show Behind the Music was huge. So it was riding the coattails of that.
He looks like onision
Garth Brooks didn't try trick anyone.  Everyone knew they were the same person
Who cares if it sucked? It has been done by a million different artists including Snoop. Because you weren’t around at the time, maybe you should understand that he was the biggest artist on the planet, having difficulty dealing with that level of fame. There was one really good song on that album, and that’s better than what 99.99% of people do. Trying something odd and failing is good. At least he had the balls to put himself out there. All you have the balls to do is criticize other people.
0:55 WE LOVE ROBERT❤❤
I think Chris Gains was the inspiration for Onision.  Finally, somewhere to place the blame.
Where's the body's Garth?
Why was this thumbnail necessary.
Didn't Charlie do a video on him being an Internet suspected serial kills?? Friends in low places😂😂
Why is no one talking about how Chris looks just onision??? A real jumpscare
Honest to god I thought that was Onision for a sec
Garth Brooks is secretly a serial killer and Chris Gaines is his alter ego...
Kid, everyone knew this was Garth Brooks well before the album came out.
Wayne's world, garth!!
I hate that the looks so similar to the dude from goo goo dolls.
11:14  that guitarist looks exactly like one of the members of my favourite band 🤔🤔
Why does it feel like he has a southern accent here I'm losing my mind
Ew he looks like onision?
Wheres the bodies G? 😂
Why is it weird that they got married after writing music together?  Do you also think it would be odd if two people painted a chapel together and fell in love. If not, where is it OK for two people to meet and later allowed to get married?
Oh, God. I’m an Old™️, so despite not knowing any Garth Brooks songs (aside from the “friends in low places” hook), this whole thing is VIVID in my mind… at least as a 10-11-year old kid, for some reason this was something I was keenly aware of.   I may have never felt older than I did while watching this video, but that would not be very Greg of me.  Yes, it was weird af, and as a child I was deeply confused—but somehow less confused than my country-music loving extended family (no shade).
My name is literally Chris Gaines. I was born in 1995 though and was born in Oklahoma. I swear this man walked through a hospital and saw my name and stole it.
*to the tune of low places* “I’ve got kids in my basement” 😎
And I got the chris gaines cd for like a buck at Goodwill😂😂
i fulllly thought the guy in the thumbnail was onision omfg
Tbh his backstory is pretty close to mine. But with the addition being my mom just died last year and my boyfriend died in may. lol.
Chris angel??😭😭
wdym he sold 170 million albums and that's the first time i'm ever hearing of this guy, this feels fake
Is this what inspired Joaquin Phoenix and the whole ‘I’m still here’ rapper thing?
9:08 🤣 “…but you’ll never tell”
Chris Ganes looking like Chris Anel XDDD
The public negativity towards Jerry Seinfeld is unfounded. Whether you get the humor or not, it started because some guy went on YouTube bashing Jerry because they misunderstood something he said in an interview. Totally inferred a completely different meaning to what he was actually saying, just saying. Fun video!
You look 17
j
Chris Gaines vs Hannah Montana in a Diva Off
I want to put my PG songs on my normal page and put my explicit songs under a different name.
I clicked cause it recommended me this vid and I thought “why is this guy calling Onision a musician.”
Where are the bodies, Garth?
3:34 don't think Danny realised this was a pun on Garth Brooks' song Against The Grain
8:21 is absoutely correct! I lived it and remember it as a kid! Haha
I love garths music sm  Me and my brother have all his albums
Dude, please, I'm begging you... Look up Tom Segura's feud with Garth Brooks.  It's legendary.  If you don't know, Tom Segura is a hugely popular comedian and podcaster who started Your Mom's House and 2 Bears 1 Cave.  He had a whole campaign of trolling Garth Brooks relentlessly, to the point that he got his fandom to start a rumor that Garth Brooks is a serial killer and they would go to his concerts holding up signs saying, "Where are the bodies Garth?"  They would spam his Facebook and Instagram constantly with this, so that even his fans began asking him about it!
I need a Chris Gaines:Behind the Music episode now.
people thought he was a serial killer
It wasn’t that big of a deal and never  gained traction.
I remember hearing about this in the few years after it happened, I was young but now I feel really old.
Darth Brooks
1:17 didn’t Michael Jackson sell like 300 *million records globally… (edit: I meant 300 mil that’s my bad)
9:37 It’s so funny because Taylor Swift genuinely dressed up as a man for The Man music video and no one batted an eye until it showed the process at the end
fox_szn? isnt that guys some kinda....nepo baby?
this is such a weird video to watch because my name is gaines lmao
bro studied neon vortex
Thought this was onision
you know, i'm not That surprised garth brooks pulled this shit. brooks was the dude who Single-handedly made country music into the corporate slop it is today, of course he'd try to pull it again with proto-emo music lol
It’s amazing how much is misunderstood when looking back on a world you never lived in. Danny’s life, although born in the 90s would first be shaped like many his age by the events of September 11th, 2001. The world that shaped him and the only world he knew was the post-9/11 world. A world that would be introduced to Web 2.0 only a few years after. Essentially, the world Danny tries to understand is one very different from the world he knows and he’s always lived in. In 1999, Google barely existed, just one of many other search engines on the Internet; YouTube didn’t exist; and social media was a concept that wouldn’t even begin to form for another 4 years with the introduction of MySpace and Facebook just a year later. Chris Gaines was a massive marketing campaign, an ARG before the term was even coined. Although brilliant, it was a bit ahead of its time and hence misunderstood by many. The technology and the mediums that would make ARGs really successful were still years away, but I applaud the vision and effort that went wholeheartedly into creating Chris Gaines and the lore behind him.
Jesus, I can’t. Your personality is insufferable and reeks of privilege
CG era was a wild era
Joanna Gaines my queen
Don’t pretend that isn’t you.
Chris gains sounds like a fitness influencer name
14:41 imagine home alone but the robber is the main character
3:22 oh i didn't know you got Emo Abraham lincoln to do this with you. Good to see CZsworld here.
FOX SZN IS DANNY???? THIS HAS GOTTA BE FAKE WAHT
He had a soul patch.  OF COURSE he had a soul patch.
I genuinely dont believe that creature is Garth brooks. They must have airbrushed him into oblivion.
No he didn't.  The album literally has Garth Brooks AS Chris Gaines written on the front cover.  Stealthy.
Can you imagine the polygamy lawsuits if Drake married his ghost writers
i have an uncle garth. when i was young he told me that he used to be spider-man
how dare youtube hide this from me for literally 9 months
Chris Gains walked so that Neon Vortex could run
Hannah Montana is a biopic of Chris Gaines.
They're both fictional the real guy behind these is Garth Gaines a wife and a yard
7:41
Derek Zoolander and Chris Gaines is the same person
I remember this 😂it def was the height of his fame but it took a sharp turn downward after that.. I don't recall the movie being the catalyst, he made up the movie as an afterthought to try to explain himself and I don't remember anything about a movie but soooo much marketing for the album. The music sold because streaming didn't exist and people gave him a chance, all of his millions of fans bought it and hated it and it got no radio play before or after
Only Garth I ever heard of was Aqualad
my mom loves garth brooks sm that when i mentioned chris gaines her reaction was  like i just told her i killed a man.
This guy has nothing on Mauro Farina (for context, that guy has been making music since 1982, still making music nowadays and has hundreds of aliases and thousands of songs, he may not be famous but he is a beast)
The problem is country music fans think all country artists are actually rednecks and live the life they sing about, bo Burnham has a really good song about it called Pandering
The first thing I thought of was Beyoncé as Sacha Fierce.
7:47
hey, isn't this guy from that one vine?
I worked at a small market radio station in the late 90s.... we were just as confused back then.
This  guys such a clout leach claiming hes fox season dispicable
Bro thats just onision
Never forget
9:28 made me laugh out loud
I was born in 99 and my last name is Gaines 🤯
Unironically I remember Chris Gains more than Garth Brooks 😭
and he just got sued for sa on his make up artist ...
This was to drum up interest for a movie about a troubled rockstar. The movie wasn’t finished due to management and financial difficulties. Of course leaving out this context makes this more interesting than it actually is or ever was. Textbook YouTuber creator tactics.
Millennial here....i remember this happening and being confused n weirded out by this 😅  this is the first im hearing that it was for a movie....its suspicious lol
Garth Brooks's Chris Gaines album was released on September 28, 1999. Were you even born then? He did this because he wanted to shake up the music world, and was very successful. And this was done before you were even born!
I like how Chris Gains dad dying of cancer made him become a sex addict. Chris got off on that shit.
It was never really a secret here in Garths home town that before he hit it big as Garth he was Chris Gains and played local music in dive bars.  He's done this his entire career locally and usually had some kind of disguise to keep the average person from making the connection and asking him to play a ton of garth songs.    The last time I even though about chris gains or heard the name was almost 15 years ago so it's  kind of surprising to see this pop up in my feed.  But Fun Fact, Garth Brooks is the Alter Ego, not the other way around. :P
wait fox szn is danny? why am i js learning this
I remember this.
Absolutely love that Danny took the idea of a no shoes alter ego and let Fox Szn run with it
Garth Brooks is the only mainstream artist I know of that has managed to have their music completely unavailable to stream anywhere, not on spotify, youtube, or anything. It's actually incredible.
This was WILD. I'm GenX and lived through the Chris Gains fiasco, but had no idea it went this deep 😂😂😭😭
We still don't know where Garth put the bodies.
i fucking hate that i immediately knew the emo hair at 3:18 was kellin quinn
so basically chris gaines is severus snape-
Chris Gaines’s backstory sounds like an OC I would’ve made when I was 12 😭
I want to meet this silly guy named Robert
IVE BEEN LISTENING TO NEPO BABY FOR A WEEK NOW AND I KEPT GOING BACK AND FORTH WEATHER IT WAS YOU OR NOT AND IT WAS
Chris Gaines looks like Onision
i think you're confused because there was basically no internet then. the music video was released before the album was announced, so the album wasn't cited on the music video or i guess on the radio
i remember this at the time cause im ten years older than you. iirc the first week the music video came out they pretended it was a new artist. i think the second week they said it was an alter ego but wouldn't say who, and then the week after that they 'revealed' it was him. carson daly was really sarcastic about like 'gee who could it be?' but considering mtv didnt play much country i guess i didn't make the connection, though i wasnt too surprised once it was revealed
Tbh I don't see why this is so bad? I guess he wanted to start a new artist persona. After all, Garth Brooks is also just another persona, just a well known one.
Ya I remember this back in the day …. Cause I’m old lol but never heard of no movie lol everyone just thought he was going through a midlife crisis 😂😂😂😂
Why is Danny pretending to be fox szn?
He was not trying to trick anyone, everyone knew that it was him. It was a gimmick.
How much do you and Kurtis Konner hang out lol I catch some of his inflections in your voice 😂
🤣🤣🤣
Why is the second channel the main channel
Tell us where the bodies are, Garth!!!
i thought that was nikki sixx
I’m old enough to remember when that happened and thinking WTF?!
he was recently accused of s ual misconduct so...probably why he tried to make a new persona.
The disguise looks like the magic shop skits guy from wizardswithguns
Is nobody going to talk about the fact that you're actually Zach Cox from the GTA 5 videos 🤣🤣🤣
What y’all know about Chris Gaines?!! Lol😂
I had the actual album at the time, which clearly said "Garth Brooks as Chris Gaines," and that it was for a movie he would be in called The Lamb.   The problem is that it was supposed to be the greatest hits album of this fictional character, and the songs just werent great.
Biggest fan of Robert
This was a hilarious learning experience.
Dude, how could you believe that stupid Biography?? You really think he outsold Elvis Presley? Elvis sold over a billion records..Micheal Jackson sold over 400 Million..
It was for a movie that never got made, but he still had the soundtrack made.
Chris Gaines is Kurt Cobain. Garth just took the fall for his grunge buddy.
His alter ego looks like Onision lol
disappointed you didnt mention how chris gaines is above mariah carrey on the charts lmao  😂😂
TL;DR He was supposed to have been doing a movie. The movie fell through, but he had already recorded the album associated with it. He tried to just make it work, and it didn't work. No one was ever supposed to think he was actually that guy.
Chris Gaines was a character created for a movie and the songs for a soundtrack. He did aperences and press to promote the movie. It ended up not going into production and was just left some fun aperences. He even introduced himself on snl.
Late comment but apparently there’s a podcast series about it from 2019…called Chris Gaines: The Podcast. …also Garth Brooks is the friend you hit up to run errands w/ and end up spending hours just riffing different characters in every store.
Is Danny coming back as FoxSzn to collab with Chris Gaines?
Chris Gaines? More like Garth Reznor.
He released the album before this HUGE movie, then never released the movie, so we had no idea what was going on.
well, this took a turn!
This is basically the plotline of The Vampire Lestat
I just realized that danny is 30 years old
well this is weird now
I think this was just a failed attempt at faking a new character on the world stage, this one just slipped away and they had to make up a fake story about a fake movie just to cover it up
plot twist: Garth Brooks is an alter ego of someone else entirely.
this video mirrors the release of nepo baby by fox szn almost perfectly. danny did you do it on purpose?
we all had an emo phase
3:25 Schindler‘s list?
How have I never heard of this man, nor heard any of his top songs
chris gaines has the trauma of an oc
14:39 this movie would've made The Boy in the Striped Pajamas feel like you're watching a Dave Chappelle special
Honestly Chris Gaines’ music is kinda good
Robert’s not real
Is this what he's doing with Fox Szn and 3drinks bc that be funny
Fun fact unspeakable made a house with Lego and IT WORKED like really well (I know this cuz I used to watch unspeakable I’m an OG fan)  Edit: I think the old vids are better
Danny you son of a bitch I know you're up to now, I can't wait for the full Fox Szn and 3Drinkz movie coming out 2025
Am i the only person who hasnt heard about this, 😂 i really must have led a sheltered life.
I loved that Album.
Woohoo, Robert. You go Robert!
He absolutely just did a quick change during the musical intro
"Chris Gaines" kinda looks like Onision
bro every time the music video was shown i thought it was onision 😭😭
Every time you say Chris Gaines I accidentally think of Chris Angel for a split moment
I was around when he did these shenagians. Llol  I now have to see that video with you lmao
Your such a liar foxzn ist u
Chris Gaines looks like he either religiously listens to or is a member of Three Days Grace
he just wanted to play hannah montana :(
I was a big fan of Garth Brooks back in the day… but that whole weird cringy Chris Gaines episode in his career instantly & totally turned me off.🤢Never looked back… Along with MANY many fans, I said, “Adios, Creeper!”
What in the mind freak is this? I'm sure he styled his alter ego on Chris Angel.  I'm sure Taylor Swift used a pseudonym to write one of her songs -- Nils Sjöberg.
oh my god i completely forgot about this i was 7 at the time but my dad was a fan of his so i heard all about it. my dad had secondhand embarrassment for him, and he never even feels embarrassment for himself 😂
Where are the bodies Garth?
Danny, you're so young.  It's hard to explain the popularity of Garth Brooks, from the 1990s through today.  In country music, there are these rare artists that reach “cross-over” status.  Crossing over from Country to Pop music.  You read those stats of how many records Garth Brooks sold, only The Beatles have sold more, I believe The Eagles might have passed them.   He had 19 NUMBER ONES on the Country charts, with 36 in the Top 10.  The Country Music Awards, he has one the top award of Entertainer of the Year, 7 Times.  You couldn't turn on the radio, and not hear a Garth Brooks song.  Getting a Ticket to one of his concerts, today, is a big ask.  I have never liked country music, but I like Garth Brooks.
This is literally that Keith urban guy lol
This video is 17:38… yaaaaa baby
Props 2 Robert we love robert🎉💗
Why not add a link to the article you're reading word for word? Anyway, this is interesting, I had no idea who this Chris guy was
jojo took inspo from Gaines
Garth Brooks was making fun of Goth culture. Pretty sure that's why it failed.
When he did this it was terrible. I was a kid and loved garth brooks
I literally clicked this video under the assumption that the “musician” who tried and failed to change his identity was Onision
This is so bizarre but I’ve been trying to find this song/artist since 1999, it used to play on the radio at night when I was 6. All I remembered was the melody , thus it’s been hard to search for online. I clicked on the video cause I liked your shirt and subsequently solved a life long mystery 🥲 thank you so much
All jokes aside the Chris Gaines album is 🔥 the song “lost in you” was written by Babyface and it’s soulful R&B which is far from his traditional country music.
So this is where Danny got his inspiration for Neon Vortex
He's forever gonna be Barth Grooks in my mind now, thanks a lot 😂
Ok I usually don't write comments, but  PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT IS THE PIECE PLAYED AT 00:29 CALLED???  I have heard it many times before, but I never bothered to check, nor ask. Deeply regretting my decisions.
If this happened now it would be just another tuesday and we would forget about it in a week.
Garth Brooks giving his alter ego a "sex addiction" is so genuinely cringey.
Just realized Bully Maguire was totally inspired by Chris Gaines.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS NIKKI SIXX IN THE THUMBNAIL
great idea garth, people just LOVE being lied to ❤ pos
"...all of which were fictional" "WAIT DID HE RELEASE MUSIC BEFORE AS GAINES?" c'mon, man...
That’s not Onision??
7:39 HAND ME MY SHOOOVEL, IM GOING IN!!!1!1!1!
He just cosplayed Trent Reznor
DANNY!! You're WRONG 100% wrong! People did not like Chris Gaines. Chris Gaines sucked beyond all that had sucked before, all that had sucked after, and all that will ever suck again. People did not like Chris Gaines. only the Fans of Suck liked him. The Fans of Suck, the FOS, walking around, pretending to be people!! We know who they are, we see them everywhere with their bad dating advice tik toks, their 'unschooling' videos,. and listening to *growls it out through my teeth* Chris Gaines! Would love to see you do a deep dive on FOS, who they are now, who they've been and who they're likey to become. God I hope you see this comment!
Well, you were 5 when it happened, you're excused for not knowing lol However being exactly your age now when it happened,  if I'd only had youtube, or, youtube had existed. I could have done a viral video on how everyone hated Chris Gaines lol
Ooh the Fox Szn mention in this video 🫠
Chris Gaines was a body double in that SNL clip and he lip synced.
Barf Crook is coming to steal all of Chris's gains
I feel like he was just bored after being successful and wanted a fun way to make music in a completely different genre and show his voice is beyond country. I think it’s funny and if it failed it wouldn’t have had a huge impact on his Garth brooks music lol
This was similar to  Jojo Siwa trying to change her image.
I remember this well. He even went on SNL as Gaines. It might have worked better if he lost some weight. 😂. His pictures as “Gaines” were heavily photoshopped to appear a lot thinner than he really was. When he performed live he looked nothing like the Gaines photos 😂. It was so obviously chubby face Brookes. His alter ego was 25lbs  lighter, but only in his head 😂😂😂.
Garth Brooks secretly wanted to do a music industry ARG and the world just wasn’t ready… 😔
Why does Chris Gaines look like Onision?
one of the best vids on youtube
My highschool teacher was related to him lol. I loved Mr.Brooks great English teacher.
a quadrangle surrounded by a cloister!
I think this happened in the walking dead
When Danny was reading out the story of Gaines it sounded like an average edgy oc lore
Friends in Low Places sounds absolutely NOTHING like Lost in You.
Keith Suburan
This was a weird time.  I remember his face as Chris Gaines was everywhere on magazine covers at the grocery store.  He was on VH1 a lot.  He was up front about it.  He was on Entertainment Tonight talking about the project.
I don’t think he was trying to hide it though lol it was just some weird artsy alter ego thing
1:46 thats my moms favorite song 😭
Danny, how are you older than me and looking that good?
He tried to do a Joaquin Phoenix, but didn’t have a Casey Affleck.
GB is a pretty good singer. He released so many compilations with a few new songs. As You can see, at the time if it said "Garth Brooks" on it, people would buy 2. His album stats are padded with compilations. Not hating on him for that, but back in those days He was also trying to stop people from re-selling CDs. Most celebrities aren't super good people.
The funniest thing about the Chris Gaines character is when he performs, he stares at the ground and hides his face with bangs. This was Garth’s way of concealing his identity, and the way it is explained in the bio is that Gaines was scarred in a car wreck and is afraid to show his face. 😂
Garth brooks is my childhood country defined
at the time it wouldve been cool seeing your favorite artist play a character in real life and also in a movie, but no movie no info to public
17:05 He took that as an idea NEPO BABY IM NOT A BABY I AM FORTY FIVE
I had forgotten about  Garth doing this.  I do like this song and video. thi
I didn't know you had another channel Danny ooooooooooooo
Garth brooks took friends in love places to seriously😭
Darth Brooks
i remember when 'chris gaines' came out.  if garth's name was on the album, the radio stations where i lived didn't mention it. of course it almost came out immediately after and people laughed. i dont remember one song from chris gaines.
I asked my dad, who was in the music industry at the time of this, what he thought about this, and he said he thought it was actually kind of genius lol
this video backs up my point about why danny should be my history teacher
Wait until danny hears about a series of unfortunate events
dang you old old
You’ve never watched Wayne’s World?! Wayne and Garth? Sir, you need to brush up on your movies. 😂😂
4:55 ain’t this just the plot of Austin and Ally
I was there
Great job Greg
2:33 bro has no one noticed Danny’s hickey????? On the right side of his neck it’s big too😭💀😅
Personally, I would’ve gone with Barth Grooks.
I'm always confused how rapidly the videos on this channel end, it's like we're in a middle of some story and then Danny just goes "ok, see you in the next video, bye" and before I can comprehend what happened it's over 😂 bro, give me some warning 😅
✨robert ✨
Bruh Chris Gaines just sounds like Keith urban?????

'QUADRANGLE' XD
their gaslighting more than people acting like gwimblys a real game online....which it is
0:58 "What exactly happened back in 1999" Reverse: 1999 reference ??
Have you never seen Wayne's World?
Weird that I briefly recognized heard of Chris Gaines but not Garth Brooks
I’ve known so much about Garth brooks (mother was a huge country fan) but I had no idea about this howwwww????
Kendrick Lamar is basically using his cousin Baby Keem to do this
I remember Stephen King had to go under a pseudonym for a while. He was churning out so many books but was only allowed to publish one per year, which was standard for authors at the time. Since he wanted to get his stories out there but wasn’t allowed to do it under his own name in fear of “over-saturating the market with the King name”, He had to go by Richard Bachman for any second releases in one year. Under this name he wrote one of, if not the most controversial piece in his bibliography, “Rage”, which has been attributed to inspiring at least three separate school shootings.   He later “killed” Richard Bachman when views around publishing numbers changed and he was allowed to have more than one book a year, only then admitting it was him who wrote the books (though it had been theorised before he confirmed it). He wanted to see if his success was luck or talent, but was outed as Bachman too soon to tell in his opinion, though receptions of the books were still high on release, before Kings name was attached.   This feels like something similar. The brand wouldn’t let him just switch styles and confuse people, so he tried a pseudonym.
Shouts out to Robert
when I heard “We’re gonna find out what happened in 1999” I immediately thought of jshlatt
Didn't Lady Gaga also do this as Jo Calderone? Her male alter ego. I remember this back in 2010. I don't recall if she made music as Jo Calderone but she did pose as him.
Chris Gaines' story was written by Lemony Snicket
they call me nepo baby? im not a baby, i am 45😋
He tried to invent the “found footage” genre of music
Danny Gonzalez is Grath book  in disguise
I met this man’s ex wife who received a 125 million divorce settlement and she complained about jeans prices at the goodwill and she was super sweet
i'm actually kind of a fan of chris gaines, omg...that song has kinda a carol king vibe, almost?
my mother is a huge Garth Brooks fan, i texted her asking if she knew who Chris Gaines was and she responds with a picture of a CHRIS GAINES CD
your not fox szn
That would be like if Gerard Way started dressing as and releasing music as Miranda Lambert
Your fake persona looks like my ex in the standing shot XD
The only person I know of named Garth is Aqualad
This video made me feel my age. Watching Danny hum and haw over Chris Gaines is so surreal. We all knew. It definitely wasn't a secret.
I just had a deep thought at one point in time everyone above the age of 18 was born in the 1900s and all 2000 people were kids. At one point all adults were from 1900s…
The actual album title was Garth Brooks in The Life of Chris Gaines. He never tried to hide, and you are very uninformed if you do not know who Garth Brooks is.
Who did it better garth or miley?
7:41 the Wikipedia definition is so funny to me
This is what happens when famous people get bored.
i would have liked to see the shitty _Spinal Tap_ knockoff this movie would have been. That said, as a lifelong Garth Brooks fan, this video is immensely funny. There is something wrong with this guy but not in the way things are normally wrong with musicians. Why did he release a song about dying in Ireland
I was a child at the time so I just had the whole moment of OH MY GOD THAT'S TWO PEOPLE????
we love fox szn
I was in college when this happened. You have to remember the internet wasn't full of news articles or social media or search engines like it is now. We had MTv.  That music video was 💯 released as part of a publicity stunt (most likely to see if he could infiltrate both the pop & country charts the way Canadian Shania Twain did in America). But he knew he couldn't do it with his cowboy look and he didn't want that yeehaw persona to affect the experiment because everyone literally associated him as THE face of country. They released "Lost in You" on MTV in July and there was ZERO mentioning of "Garth Brooks" on the album name because he absolutely WAS trying to trick everyone. Everyone immediately figured it out and were really weirded out by it because everyone thought he was just being a liar and a poser. (YOU DID NOT WANT TO BE A POSER) The public didn't appreciate trying to be fooled, especially with no context. Thennnnnnn, in the fall, after a lot of weird reactions, his real name was suddenly on the album name and it was supposedly for some movie but we all knew it was a BS PR experiment gone wrong. And then it faded away with his relevancy. It was really, really bizarre and not in the provocative way. Just wanted to give a perspective from someone who was like WTF when it happened. Also, you need to watch Wayne's World. "Party on Garth!" 😂
Danny is secretly moonlighting as Luke Beasley. you can't fool me.
Buddy, google was new and kinda bad then, googling stuff wasn't a thing
Danny discovers the ease of wild rumours and misinformation before good internet
Danny saying what happened in 1999 is so funny if you get the reference
It's giving Trent Reznor thinks he's Prince vibes.
i misheard his name as barf gooks and now i can't stop hearing it throughout the video
Why did Dave filoni try to become onision?
Well, I can assure you, if you lived through the time when he did this, it wouldn't have made any more sense. I remember everyone knowing it was him while he was doing it, it wasn't a secret.
The Chris Gaines song was absolutely not his biggest hit. It was his only song to appear on the hot 40 chart because that was a Pop music chart.  I was really into country during this time and no one liked Chris Gaines. Everyone thought Garth Brooks was having a mental breakdown. There was very very little talk about the alleged movie, the Internet barely existed at this time so the TV was really the only source for music news and they didn't really do much but look at this whole thing just as confused as everyone else.
thank you robert
He looks like Chris Angele's cousin 😂
Reminds me of the trick "Schlarith Schlooks" pulled the same year
So, the VH1 episode was the movie
as of 9:30 am, 21/05/24 aedt (gmt+10), this video has 2.2 million views, was posted 2 months ago, and danny's 2nd channel has two 2's in its' name. what could this mean?
omggg this is like JoJo Siwa's weird emo arc thing
He picked the wrong genre for a guy looking like that. Should have picked pop punk haha. Especially with a back story like that too
Bruh I thought that was Onision for a solid moment
Never heard of him, honestly.
How is Danny almost 30 years old.   I hope danny didn't read this.
Danny!! You can't just go around spreading misinformation, you are NOT fox SZN!!! You know you guys are 2 SEPERATE people. Stop trying to make drama Mr Gonzalez
El momento que lo mantiene humilde JAJAJAJAJA
Youve never heard of Wayne and Garth from Wayne's World?
what the skibidi
like i was fully prepared this was gonna be a video about onision hiring some country dude to be the face of his alter ego while he sings the vocals… 😭
9:29 *flashes back to the Jojo Siwa drama*
I just found a Chris Gaines CD in my room 🧍‍♀️
i have never heard this man's music in my life he fact he's the most popular is fucking wild to me 😭
I 100% thought Chris Gaines was Onision, and I was scared to watch this video
14:28 dude sounds like Meredith grey from greys anatomy 😭
That effeminate voice doesn't sound very "rockstarish", if you ask me. It's quite lovely though.
this reminds me of Green Day and The Network
The movie would have truly  been a series of unfortunate events.
Where are the bodies Garth?
I remember this happening (I was 10). It was very confusing and he 100% thought he could convince everyone. This video was the first time I heard of any movie lol
"pay me for lawn mowing" but they never did it - this is a real scam too and is common in the UK. Cowboy builders and handymen prey on vulnerable people, doing substandard or no work but then demanding payment.
I don't know why this is so funny.
Fox seasons collabing w/ chris gaines tho
I've no idea who this artist is. Could have easily fooled me if you showed me photos side by side and played song back to back. I would never re-listen the songs because they were all kinda bad.
Danny low key revealing he’s never seen Wayne’s World. Never heard of a person named Garth?!?!
7:45 Garth from Wayne’s World!!!!
“This is probably the worst quality video of youtube” Well clearly someone here has not had to sit through a 1920’s version of Shakespears most contraversal play “The taming of the shrew” because of their stupid english teacher and peoples reluctance to remake controversial films.
Man, this was actually a pretty funny and cool part of music history.  It's so wild seeing somebody else discover it for the first time, lol
you should do this again danny.  but like make the disguise incredible and like alter your voice or something.  nobody would expect it
Oh, you're too young to remember Chris Gaines? Buckle up, buckaroo!
Didnt he just pass away?
14:56 they weren't googling it. 😅
From someone who was around at the time, you have to understand some things: Brooks was the hottest thing in music for a brief period (and yes, it was weird having a country artist be the hottest thing in music). His label was looking for ways to cash in on his popularity and settled for trying to get him into the movies. He wanted to play a "rock star" so it was going to be a fictional biopic for this character. At no point was anyone trying to fool anyone into thinking Chris Gaines was a different person, and in fact the label was worried his fans *would* think that, hence the awkward addition of "Garth Brooks As..." on the title of the album (keep in mind, the internet wasn't a big thing at the time). At the same time, Brooks wanted to play it straight when he performed as Chris Gaines, which makes it seem in retrospect like he was trying to fool people.  The problem wound up being that the character and the songs didn't appeal to his fan base (or anyone else) and the movie project, which wasn't widespread knowledge, never got off the ground so people had no idea what the impetus for it was.
chris’ backstory is giving a 13 yo creating an oc for the first time
He definitely intended to pretend to pass this off.  IT WAS NOT A MOVIE. The original album did not have Garth on it.  It was a weird  thing but the music was good.
LIVE LAUGH LOVE ROBERT ❤❤❤
I kinda want to create an alter ego…
I vaguely remember this. I'm pretty sure it was pretty well known that Garth Brooks and Chris Gaines were the same person but I wasn't a Garth Brooks fan anyway so maybe I only heard about it after it had all come to light
I genuinely thought that was Onision in the thumbnail for a second.
the the fuck is danny older than Jschlatt!!?!!??!
THEY CALL ME NEPO BABY, IM NOT A BABY. I AM 45!!!🙏🙏😎😎🥵🥵💪💪💪💪💯💯💯
Austin butler reference is crazy😭🙏
I like both Garth and Garth as Chris Gaines. Also it’s an insult to compare Chris to onion boy. I get like the hair, but other than that they definitely don’t look alike.
hey im a cult leader and i do wear shoes stop judging and read your jible which is a bible written be jim
WE STAN ROBERT!!!!
Where are the bodies G ?
1999 was the year the film Man on the Moon came out. It's a biopic about Andy Kaufman who had a long running bit where he played a lounge singer named Tony Clifton and constantly insisted that they were 2 different people, even though everyone knew the truth. I wouldn't be at all surprised if that was Garth's inspiration here.
I remember when this happened - Garth Brooks was crazy huge and this Chris Gaines stuff came out and then Brooks just disappeared, he didn’t make anymore albums or songs, and I think they even stopped playing him on the radio. Although didn’t think he was trying to come out and try not to be recognized it was like an alter ego or something. I don’t remember ANYTHING about a movie as a matter of fact he was on a talk show saying “some of my country fans won’t go on this ride but that’s ok” I remember that distinctly
danny if it makes you feel any better, ive been listening to that song for two years waitin for more. i had no idea it was you. ive been religiously watching your videos for FOUR years. i listen to your other music. im fucking dumb, basically
You’re going to collab with Chris gains and I’m going to lose my mind
Gotta show my mom this video. Her favorite singer is Garth Brooks
If you look into Garth Brooks' history he started out playing rock music, and got into country following the success of acts like George Strait, "Chris Gaines" was just an attempt to be the rockstar he'd wanted to be, instead of crooning "Low Places" 200 times a year.
What song plays at 3:18?
W robert
i keep thinking its Chris Angel 😭
Wait til you hear about the Traveling Wilburys...
5:43 - Hannah Montana DID release an album similar to this! It was called "Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus". One disc was Hannah and the other disc was Miley. They were the basis for her debut tour, literally called the 'Best of Both Worlds' tour!  Source: 7-10 year old me who played that album until the CDs no longer worked
Never heard of him before
This was not a fail theres still people that dont realise its the same person and it was not done to fool anyone 😂 do some research it was done for a movie. Have you heard garth talk about chris lmao do some research please this is just embarrassing
"Garth brooks is the #1 best-selling solo artist of all time". *Miachel Jackson turns in his grave.*
The hair hides his lobotomy 😔🙏🏻
I THOUGHT THAT WAS ONISION AND SCREAMED
Where’s the bodies Garth??
HELP WHY DOES CHRIS GAINES LOOK LIKE ONISION
He wasn't trying to fool anyone. It was highly publicized that Garth Brooks had come up with an alter ego to release pop music.
This was for a movie that never got made
Never heard the name garth?  😑  ... go watch Wayne's World, life noob
Someone make fanart of danny in 2000s emo fashion, or just draw ut iver him
It looks like he was trying to audition for the role of Severus Snape. He didn't get the part.
“yes ned flames” we all say in unison
I remember this. I hate country music, but I live in the South, so it came up. Criss Angel Garth Brooks was an odd time. “What the fuck is this” type of weird. I felt like it’s hide-and-seek with a 5 year old hiding behind the dog. “Dude… we can see you.”
danny we both know all of these guys are your alter egos...
I remember watching Chris Gaines perform on Saturday Night Live when Garth Brooks hosted. They sang a duet.
Guys I get it now He was trying to live the best of both worlds…
Chris Gaines looks like someone mixed Brookes with Shane Dawson I hate it
Robert looks like Dave Franco
It's crazy to me that a person can be unaware of garth brooks
I prefer Garth Maul
Where are the bodies Garth😉
17:26 THIS IS JUST LIKE HOW THERES SUDDENLY MORE FOXSZN!!!! (Which I mean makes sense Ned Flames was probably ashamed when some YouTuber guy pretended to be him and got so many views smh..)
garth needed to listen to some nirvana
guys. that's- guys. that's my bass teacher. deadass.
I am Old(TM) and recall the Chris Gains thing. It really didn't come across as an art piece at all. I remember a lot of us in high school mocking the hell out of him.
Barth Grooks.
So Garth Brooks is Trent Reznor?
My father in law’s deadname is Garth
Is he not the male version of Hannah Montana or am I trippin
2:31 is it just me or does he look like the guy from Zoolander??
He's a murderer and a cannibal.
omg danny is 30?
I'm guilty of thinking back then that Garth was just absolutely going THROUGH ittt. I never knew it was all just for a movie that never... happened.. 😂
Garth, the families want answers.
As a younger Garth fan, I actually really enjoyed listening to him in a different style ❤
I remember when this whole thing happened. It was insane. Everyone new it was Garth Brooks. It wasn't a secret. He did it so he could crossover into pop music. It wasn't as easy as today for country artists to also do pop music. I remember it being this massive huge deal that Shania Twain had a pop hit. The 90's were wild.
Obviously, the reason Danny's FoxSzn persona never took off is because he didn't write him an absurdly tragic backstory (e.g. his wife was killed by his dog, who was run over by a train driven by his childhood friend, who died from leukemia)

Putting together that 40-something minute doco would have been so fun, that’s real commitment to the bit.
it was his highest charting “rock” single as it was his only rock single. he was a country musician so most of his songs would be on the country charts, not the rock charts.   also, it was totally meant to make chris seem real. he genuinely thought he was fooling people, he did interviews and everything else as chris and would not openly admit that he was chris for some time after the album was released. i can understand it, he was influenced by a lot of rock music such as kiss, and even appeared with dimebag darrell and ace frehley in full kiss makeup on the cover of a guitar magazine around this time. you can’t blame him for wanting to express some of those influences, and country fans aren’t exactly the most open to new ideas people in the world. they tend to be quite judgemental (or otherwise mental) about their artists trying something new, especially if it isn’t within the country realm. so i get that he tried to hide it, but this was so obvious, instantly laughable, and notoriously bad. it wasn’t good enough as rock music, being that it was written by country musicians, and it wasn’t country. he f’d himself for a couple years after this episode i think.
Mom can we have kurt cobain?  Honey we have kurt cobain at home Kurt cobain at home:
Honestly funny enough I don't mind this music video lol
i cant watch ts no more mf reaching
I wonder if Chris Gaines knows where the bodies are
Looks like Criss Angel
Oh my god??
"was this as his career faded into irrelevance?" garth brooks has never faded into irrelevance lol last year he played a concert to over 100,000 people
3:17 anyone know the name of the music used in the background..?
Danny: cult leaders don’t wear shoes Heavens Gate: am I a joke to you?!
As a not-a-country fan, this was hilariously glorious to live through in real time.
I guess he really wanted to be Andy Kaufman (a guy who had an alter ego in the 70s called Tony Clifton, a crude lounge singer that would play music before Kaufman did his comedy set at shows. I think he even pretended to die? It's been a sec since I heard about that dude.)
Vegan Gains
lmao I think my life rivals gaines for dark twists tbh...
lol I’m old and remember this happening. He totally tried to roll out Chris Gaines without having ANY connection to Garth Brooks. This is the first time I’ve heard this nonsense about there being a movie and that it was clear that Chris Gaines is just Garth Brooks in a 40 year old man’s idea of rockstar.
Holy shit Danny are you 30, I thought you were like 10 and a half at the MOST.  Boy you looking GOOD!
Is that Robert orrrrrr…..Dave Franco that’s the real question
They should have released the movie first, then the album. He was trying to copycat Bette Midler!  She was an actress/comedian that played a rock singer called "Rose" in a movie by the same name. However, her company released the sound track and music from 'Rose' after the movie! She made it work. He didn't succeed at trying to do the same thing.
damn what is it with me and guys around my older brothers age?? i get along w them well,  i end up watching them on yt, we werent even close and yet here i am hearing u say u were about my brothers age when i was born
Garth was not the first person to do this other guys did it too, specifically and most famous David Bowie and Ziggy Stardust
I kinda think he's a genius
guys please what song is in the background of 3:18... please don't tell me its just royalty free rock music i need an actual song
I laughed so f hard... I can't. So so funny!
Where are the bodies?
Reminds me of Stephen King releasing books under the pen name Richard Bachman.
Nobody is talking about Miley Cyrus and “Hanna Montana”
Danny changed his mind 1200 times, you did it Chris, we're all confused
Chris Gaines’s backstory sounds like something a preteen girl would give her self-insert MC on wattpad
He did this when he was still hugely popular---like when Michael Jordan left the NBA to go play baseball.
Yikes,  like the awesome 90s pencils?
I thought that was Onision in the thumbnail😭help
Ya didnt know cause youre not from the south. This was a canon fucking event because he was so fucking big for the culture of country music by getting it popular up north as well. SO when he switched everything up there were a lot of very agitated good ol boys lol
The movie was going to be - A Series Of Unfortunate Events.... 🤣🤣🤣 You could not have made this joke any easier hahaha. If you know, you know.
I don't know. To me, it looks like he's attempting to portray Onision or the lead singer of any emo band in the early to mid-200s 😆😆
Barf Brookes sounds like a creek that everyone throws up at for some reason
the lore goes crazy
Ah how can you not know about chris gaines. Best wig in the music industry lol
It’s not actually all that uncommon for music artists and bands to do anonymous side-projects. Green Day had several like The Network and Foxboro Hot Tubs. Allows them to blow off steam and experiment in genre and sounds far more than they usually can with official releases.
OHH!!!! If you like this, you're gonna wanna look up Bruce Willis & Bruno (yes THAT Bruce WIllis)
🐛
FOX SZN 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️😣😣😣😣
9:00 But that's literally just what every music video looked like around thennn.
I'm (not) sorry to be that person but Taylor Swift has definitely sold more albums than Garth Brooks lol. (Source: I'm a music teacher, also I googled it)
Hannah Montana??
where are tbe bodies g
This shit kinda reminds me of when Aziz Ansari finished one of his standup comedy specials by doing a bunch of jokes as the much more annoying version of himself, "Randy", which was the character he played in the film, "Funny People." I thought it was really weird and somehow less funny than the rest of the show.
I’m surprised you haven’t mentioned the “Garth Brooks is a serial killer” conspiracy theory
cant he just do a persona
Originally Garth Brooks did not have his name on the Chris Gaines album. I know because I bought that album (CD) upon release and still have it to this day.   Garth was definitely trying to portray Chris as a real person and not a gimmick at all. At that point he had been on top of country music for so long and he honestly wanted to branch out and try new music without alienating his fanbase.
Where are the bodies Garth? #YMH
I thought Garth brooks covered friends in low places. I didn’t know he wrote it?
Why is Robert kinda......😍
He was just trying to imitate David Bowie.
"They're filming Chris Gaines like he's Bigfoot" 😂😂😂
Let's go Robert!!
Lmao Danny still plugging Fox Szn
I cannot for the LIFE of me figure out what the thumping that starts at 10:00 is. Was he like??? Kicking the wall???
i live for every time danny says "one guy named robert"
He actually made the Chris persona for a movie. He never tried to fool anyone.
Hickey
I have to nice of headphones cause every time Danny hit his desk I heard it 10:28
This is sorta click baity.  This is like saying eminem tries convincing people that slim shady is a new person.     No one tried convincing anyone it wasnt him. Garth brooks name was in the album title.  Or even the miley cirus analogy is on point.  No one actually thinks she was trying to decieve anyone.
He's singing well as Chris!
Where are the bodies Garth? Where are they!
Now compare the Chris Gaines project to the Serial Killer conspiracy theory!
You've never heard the name Garth? have you not seen Wayne's World? :O
Ah shiiiii, you're going back to my childhood now. I remember that he was mocked then. I wasn't too clear on what was going on, because I was young, but I know that people were digging into him.
I know garth brooks becausse big l
I can't believe Tom Segura and Onision are the same person
Gains reminds me of Onisian
Garth covered this shit up better then George Lucas did with the holiday special.
The Hannah Montanna❤😂 reference hahahahaha 😂😂
I tried to search this video as I marked it so i can watch it later… I searched and then clicked and now I watched the video I wanted to watch now 🤪 I’m a crazy person lol 😂
no because i have never ever heard of this man in my life
the bizarre backstory, along with other aspects of the gaynes project, just remind me of gorillaz, both in their advertising and lore
He just wanted to cosplay Snape, with a sprinkle of Chris Angel.
Pretending to be Australian, he would of been caught out right away by real Aussies because Americans can't do Australian accents.
idk why but Chris Gaines reminded me of Onision
I own this album, we bought it asap cause everyone knew it was Garth. What a fun wild time 😂😂
Sugar gay?
Everybody knows Garth is the worlds most prolific serial killer. And he needs to be stopped. Where are the bodies Garth?
Hannah Montana absolutely released an album called "meet Miley Cyrus"
Most country accents are fake
Never heard the name Garth! ? No way!
You should make more music Danny
Yo you need to do a video on the boxer Ryan garcia. Theres too much out there for you to miss on lol
It was funny to me when the album dropped just because of the optics. But I actually kinda respected Brooks for trying. He was blown away by Ziggy Stardust and glam rock as a teen before he knew country was going to be his lane. I think a lot of artists are afraid of embracing their other influences for fear of alienating their fanbase. Like Mariah Carey lowkey doing a rock album in the 90’s. I respect that way more than someone just jumping on the bandwagon of whatever is trendy that month. So while we can critique the execution we cannot question Garth’s heart. And I say that as someone who’s never been a fan of modern country.
nice feet tho he’s got
"The five albums have to come out" reminds me of the Insane Clown Posse and now I think Chris Gaines was a proto-juggalo.....
He was also surprisingly progressive for the 90s and country.
Where are the bodies Garth?
He was actually ahead of his time i remember Joaquin phoenix successfully fooled people back in 2010 when he all the sudden tried to rebrand as a “hiphop artist” but at the end it was all for a movie. i remember being soo confused even press and fans were like uh!?
Lol 😂
Chris Gaines was going to be the character he played in a movie that never took off called "The Lamb". The album was supposed to precede the movie to stir up interest. It did do that. Just not the right kind of interest.
so...Beyonce?
I'm sitting here like "I wish I was Danny's content curator" and then the guy has the same name as me lol
Garth didn't try to pull the wool over anyone's eyes though. Because all the advertisements I ever saw, related to tge whole thing, said Garth Brooks As Chris Gaines. It was weird. But artists did stuff like that back in the 90s! Hell!  Prince made his name a symbol. Like a literal symbol! 😹💀😹
Did you bother to speak to anyone over 18 in 99? A lot of your confusion could have been resolved by talking to someone around during This time, shit wasn't subtle. That was part of the cringe. It was obliviously a bit, but he was trying to sell it like it was real.
Rabbit szn
This video is garbage. You’re so cringy.
Chris Gaines reminds me of Jared Leto
Where are the bodies Garth
9:56 kids, this is a reference to the skits of Kiwi and Mango. Do yourself a service and avoid at all costs. Chris Kattan is wildly talented, but they're kinda stinkers.
When that album came out, NOBODY didn't know it was Garth. We were all very confused.
I was a senior in high school when he did the Chris Gaines record. So stupid. You don't even want to know why he really did the alter-ego. Let's say....he lost a bet.
Where are the bodies Garth?!
Yooooooo Robert’s the guy that makes funny TikTok’s
Look up Brooks Jefferson.  Garth has a penchant for alter egos.
What’s with the “caught immediately”in the thumbnail? it was never something he was trying to hide. It was an exploration artistically for a superstar, who had already established himself as an unprecedented, massive success, not only in his genre, but as a crossover artist as well. Plenty of artists have done it to varying degrees of success. However, to characterize it as something where he was caught trying to deceive is just wrong. everyone knew it was Garth Brooks. It was a concept album and he was playing a part. Just like David Bowie did, and if I’m not mistaken, the Weeknd as well.
danny is painfully boring
Gaga did it better 💅
If you're going to fake your pfp online  *DO NOT* make it look like Onision 😅  I swear that's just a picture of him with a goatee... 😐
I don't get what people think is so weird about this, especially considering it was linked to a movie..  I'd love it if Metallica or someone changed their name because they just wanted to do an album in a different genre, and then changed back..  It's like devin townsend making a punk album just because he hates the new punk bands, and that album was great. No one talks about how he pretended to be in a punk band, or pretend to be an alien that loves coffee for that matter
Tyson Trax moment
Writers can get away it Some writers use a different name for different genres. Cause people tend to think artists can only do one style.
I think this is a midlife crisis combined with him being at the top of his field and wanting to try something new
The late 90s was a very strange time. I remember this stuff. We were like "is garth brooks try to be insinc"
It is weird, when I saw his looks and talking about him being a rock singer I was expecting ....rock music. But what came out of Chris Gaines was more like country flavored soft R&B. Frankly a lil disapointed. I wanted to here Garth do a version of Nickelback, RHCP or Foo Fighters.
He wasn’t trying to fool anybody.
Did you guys know that BEN is GLORY?
Chris Angel made music? I never knew
Garth Brooks has said he never wanted to do country music. He's a huge Kiss fan.
I loved that album he put out ❤
This is legit so interesting and strange lol like this is actually a fascinating story. I love watching videos like this about stuff from years ago I’ve never heard about lol it’s really actually intriguing.
9:37 This reminds me of when Taylor made the The Man music video and no one knew it was her playing the man at first lol
Garth Brooks may actually be ... crazy. During Covid he released a video talking to his fans on facebook and he was the most unhinged, out of touch celebrity i've ever seen. Dude is weird weird. But we love him anyway.
"Lost in You" is a total bop.  I make no apologies for that.  But everything else about it was ... odd.  The "biopic" planned was super confusing... was Garth playing Chris portraying Chris Gaines (aka. himself... aka... Also Himself).  Confuzzled.
You noobs he did it for a movie and made a album and we all knew who it was ..THIS VIDEO IS CLICK BAIT....
Garth is super nice. I used to work at best buy in tulsa and he came in quite a bit and every encounter was great.  Very humble and patient.  Chris Gaines an asshole
Chris Gaines looks like an undercover boss
I completely forgot about Chris Gaines😂😂😂 holy crap
I was alive when this happened lol I was 14 to be exact, the reason everyone thought he was insane is because that is how the media made him seem, The media ran with that narrative and never reported anything good about him. I even fell for it and thought he was nuts because of all the reporting on all the news stations and celeb gossip magz, it was even talked about often on radio stations. I remember it well.. Whether you believe so or not the media is a big influencer, Whatever they say is true whether it is or not. Mainstream media is literally propaganda. They are the same reason everybody back then thought Britney Spears & Michael Jackson was crazy, You can tell how biased they are simply by how they interview people.
all i can remember from that era was ppl making fun of him for trying to pull this off  so i am guessing he was trying to pull off like i can do this and that no one will know   and this is all i know about garth brooks lol i never listened to any of his songs...i only know him from his weird era of I'm this guy now
And now Garth Brooks impersonator Chris Gains
They fucked up because they released the album and video before announcing the actual movie also, the Billboard Hot 100 is different from the Country Billboard chart.
It's giving Paul Zimmer 💀
We appreciate you, Robert. 🤙🤙🤙
I remember when this happened. It was bizarre.
the combination of the mopey emo look with the light acoustic elevator music is scrambling my brain bigtime
It was for a movie that never happened. This video misses the mark and is stupid.
This is Paul Zimmer and Troy Becker all over again
The whole thing seems like something people doing a bunch of coke would come up with…‘’yeah then we’ll give him a troubled backstory,and and and make him have a disfigured face’’🤣😂💀
I was alive back then and the movie def seemed like damage control after Chris Gaines didn’t go over well…
Done ordered a hoover max pro extract 90
As someone who lived through this era of country music it was definitely a Beyoncé/Sasha fierce moment for him, but I can assure you that nobody thought there was a movie coming back then and everyone thought that this was a different person despite the fact that it said Garth Brooks on the album. However, I’m almost positive that people did not realize it was Brooks when it was happening until they went to concert and then the random album came 😂
Once in 1997...We were on our way to a White Zombie/Pantera concert in NH..and we stopped at a rest stop for some food..we were getting ready to leave and standing at the curb..a limo pulled in..and a guy got out..opened the back door..this guy and little girl..all dressed in black..cowboy hat..got out..they all  kinda looked at us..then went into the restaurant..Didn't know it was Garth Brooks..untill I saw him in a video..a few months later..and recognized him..
I remember this and I’m not a country music fan but Garth Brooks was huge and well known even if you weren’t. This stunt  was confusing, like what the hell is Garth Brooks doing lol. However that song went hard, me and my mom were fans of it.
Why did he want to look like Ian Watkins?
Chris Gaines - heaven knows…. Good tune!
Keith Urban games.
This was almost a good video but like 5 minutes in he just chats too much shit
OK you don't even know what you're talking about, so im not even  gonna watch the rest of the video but I'll tell you straight out that this was for a movie that never came out he done the music and the promos and some commercials for the upcoming film that was never released. He didn't try change his identity for anything.  Take it from a Gen X'er that remembers this time period all too well.
No you're not! This youtube video was recorded and edited in advance of me watching. Even if I was your first viewer, it's literally impossible for us to experience this together. Quitting the video at 54 seconds cause you are lying to me.
Ohhh like Sasha Fierce 😂
I'm happy that when I hear about Garth Brooks, the first thing my mind goes to is Eminem going "my mind don't work if my spine don't jerk, I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt" in stead of any Garth Brooks song.
Son, singles come out before the album release. At least back in the day when I grew up that’s the way it was.
Crazy
Chris Gaines is just Garth’s drag character
omg y’all remember paul zimmer or whatever
Danny you really need to catch up on the Tom Segura and Garth Brooke's lore. Tom is a comedian and the jokes he made caused Garth to block him. Whenever anyone sees Garth now, they ask him where he hid the bodies. Hilarious
Okay...my hot take on this. I was a HUGE Garth Brooks fan back in the day (still am, just hate how he doesn't post music on online platforms) and I was 12 when this album came out. I knew it was him, bought it BECAUSE it was Garth, and loved that CD. I wish I could go back and find it because that clip from the main song brought me down a big memory lane. This was also a time before Google was a reliable source of searching for anything, so I just assumed he wanted to change things up and jump on the blink-182 and Jimmy Eats World bandwagon. Can't do that easily if you're a mega country star like him. I dunno, I kind of have a soft spot for the Gaines persona he created, it fit my angsty preteen emotions.
Look up Ben Hoffman, aka Wheeler Walker Jr. He's a comedian that used to do this character as a country music star, his music was actually pretty good to the point his music became more popular then his comedy so he just switched from comedy to country music and has released like 5 albums as wheeler walker Jr
triple a batteries
Chris gains lookin like a lil emo boy
Garth Brooks is a whole ass psychopath..
This was for a movie,
TAYLOR SWIFT MENTIONED 9:33
Jus seen that the timestamp on the video is 1738
Omg that SNL clip was embarrassing 😂 the hands moving away from the eyes is so cringe.  I’m not a country fan but I like Garth Brooks. I had no idea this was a thing until now and it’s just so embarrassing!  The 90s was definitely a time 😂
As one who can remember this period in time from my perspective it was a publicity stunt as "look how  talented I am in any genre" so people didn't care for his arrogance and rat fuct his career for awhile 😊
Garth brooks as chris angel
That’s not Chris Gains that’s Onision
😂 Yeah Garth Brooks was huge! I remember being like 5 and my parents watching his TV concerts.  My family and I went hard for Garth Brooks 😂 I never knew he did this whole Chris Gaines thing though
Where are the bodies Garth? The families need closure.
not cereal 🥣 kíller garth brooks 😮
Garth is a name in Wayne’s World!
My dumb ass thought this was onision
i love danny but its so fucking stupid when americans do this kind of thing, like no, this country singer was NOT "one of the most famous people in the world" at any point, i can guarantee you no other nation has more than 100 people who have even heard of him
He did this about 30 years ago... what are you doing?
The difference between you & Garth, Garth Brooks NEVER hid this from his fans. You need to quit lying, do proper research & tell the truth on the real reason why he created this character.
I remember when that came out. Werent we supposed to know it was him though? Sort of like when Beyoncé did that alter ego Sasha Fierce album
I genuinely thought that the Chris Gaines pic was Onision
Sacha Baron Cohen
I was 19 when this happened, and we were all like “why is Garth Brooks pretending to be goth”? Emo wasn’t a thing yet. It was so weird because he literally didn’t sound any different and the songs still had a twang. There was just a tad bit more electric guitar. It was so bad… 😂 Oh I still can’t believe that happened.
And then all of this was lampshaded when Garth Brooks guest starred on Muppets Tonight. I love Garth Brooks's Shakespeare.
The origin story of Hanna Montana  😮
Cris gains is kinda like my OCs, way to much trauma.
Garth brooks is still huge! He’s an amazing entertainer. I saw him and Trisha Yearwood live after he came out of retirement.
up until now i did not know who Garth Brooks is
garth, is also,,,, a serial killer
Why not? is how I see it. I remember when this happened and I got off the toilet wiped my ass and wished him well. Meaning it wasn't a big deal. From what I remember, people weren't too keen on the idea of changing their idol into the opposite. Kinda strange but all artists are. It's why we all love them so. 😊
Mom had all the tapes/cds. These are basically childhood songs like ABC or ring around
Where have i seen this before….
I was alive for this. I was prob around 12 but i vaguely remember this. But every other video covering this has always framed it as Garth pretending like he wasnt Garth and like Chris was a completely different person. Lies! Lies on youtube! I def never heard about a movie back then.
Yea, you had to be there.
Barf brooks is a better and more apt name. Saw loads of his albums at big lots.
Please watch a series of unfort
You were 5yo in 1999???? What? You don’t look like you’re 30! You’re such a hottie, thirst is real! 😍😍😍
Look up Tim Minchin, very similar
13:21 I mean which names sounds more real… Chris Gaines or Garth Brooks
What if Garth Brooks’ alter ego was Darth Brooks
Every one knows it was a sound track for a movie and the studio decided to put on the shelf.  If you listen to the cd it realy has some good music and a couple of the songs were reworked for a Garth record.  I still have my CD and still listen to it.
I'm 42, and listen to country music. He totally tried to pull it off as someone else, only when it failed did he come out "it was a joke", I never even heard about the movie thing until now.  Plus there was a huge scandal- him an Trish started an affair during this... people were furious.
13:31 making an ocz  backstory b liek
Emo Garth Brooks is pretty hot though
This style of music video doesn’t usually work for ladies. It was used for the ‘90s and early 2000s hard rock guys. Though Amy Lee Of Evanescence does work for that style of blur effect. Danny was too young to watch or at least remember this style of hard rock music videos. I remember Chris Gaines and I liked his music and style even though I’ve never been into the sole patch. It was more about the hairstyle and outfit for me. Though I never knew about the back story..
HELP, I HAD THAT CD 😭
Bro you couldn’t escape Garth Brooks fandom in the 90s. Imagine Taylor Swift obsession, relative to the era.
this is like if people though vanilla ice was a ninja turtle cause he made the song for the movie
Hank Williams did it in the 1940’s
yeah he’s my dad lol
His disguise screams of "I am L"
Why Chris Gaines look like Light Yagami
Look into KRS-ONE AKA Tarana Burke Kurt Cobain aka Slade Smiley Kobe aka Milles Garret If ya don't see cant help ya but i got lots more playing duel rolls ..salutations to you...ty ty 😊
WHY DOES CHRIS LOOK LIKE ONISION??? HOW DID GARTH BROOKS SEE INTO THE FUTURE LIKE THAT-
Bro made a gacha character
Alter ego looks like ben stiller from zoolander
Danny is turning 30?!????????
SEVENTEEN THIRTY EIGHT
The most shocking part of this is when you find out Garth Brooks has sold more records than Michael Jackson. Splains a lot about the world we live in now.
I lived through that. We didn't understand it at the time and we didn't really care. We 100% just let it slide. We kind of all just nodded and said okay Garth.
Ngl this is the hottest Garth has ever been to me... he also resembles Ozzy in his Beatles hair phase. Also Me: looking for Chris Merch lol
Maybe bc I'm not American, but I can't believe this dude is apparently super famous and I haven't met yet anyone who knows who tf is him
Where are the bodies G
Iirc, I think he was pretty transparent at the time about what he was doing.
Why does he look like onision💀
I'm going to check it out on my own. This style sucks so much. Constantly interrupting the real information for some bs
Wow. I had completely forgotten about Garth's mental breakdown. Just kidding, but thats really what most of us thought back then. The secondhand embarrassment is still at max capacity. Lol. Can't believe how long ago that was now. 😮
It's nothing new, a musician having an AE. David Bowie, anyone?! The album has some alright songs on it, tbf.
I vaguely remember this as a kid. Thanks for the brain tweak.
I failed so bad that here we are still talking about it years later, and people are trying to monetize it with videos😂😂😂😂
Not even gonna watch the video because the title is just wrong. It was a  promotional marketing campaign for a movie they were filming, but the movie got scrapped after the album and music videos came out.
How is that NOT onision
Garth never tried to change his identity he was supposed to make a movie where he was a rock star and he made a whole album for the movie then the movie never happened idk why but they released the Christmas gains album anyway and honestly it was amazing very good
7:47 fucking killed me idk why
Okay: a lot of information to unpack.  The part of me that confuses me the most about the video is you didn’t simply ask people what they remember instead relied on wiki and a handful of articles.  What that lacks is all the build up they did on television leading up to this.  The VH1 behind the music was simply one thing of hundreds of news stories, morning show appearances, radio interviews on rock and country stations.  As a Garth Brooks fan at the time that album was released I do remember the excitement turned confusion, to simply uninterested in it after listening to it.   First things first he was open that Chris Gained was fake, but he said he wanted to explore darker art than his fans were use to and one artist in particular reminded him there are ways to reinvent yourself without actually changing your original persona.   David Bowie, more so than even Madonna one artist has changed his style even adopted different personalities on stage and that is and was David Bowie. Who famously had his Ziggy stardust era, then pivoted through styles faster than Usain Bolt at olympic trials.   And as Garth Brooks was selling out arena’s in the mid 90s so was Bowie who had just a year or so prior had done a experimental industrial rock (See Nine inch nails) album and tour called outside.  The album was much like if Twin peaks soundtrack and story was rewritten by Trent Reznor and sung by Bowie.   So Garth Brooks a supposed fan of Bowie got it into his head that would be a really cool way to bring something entirely different to fans, tell them straight up, this isn’t my normal stuff, so don’t be angry if your shocked it’s different.  Because it’s going to be different; it’s based on a story we want to tell about a man named Chris Gaines.  And that was basically that, most things like appearing on Regis and Kathy Lee (my generations show that Kelly Rippa does these days) entertainment tonight, or special events like the behind the music, it was advertised as both real and fake.   They wanted you in on the joke from the start much like “This is Spinal Tap”. Problem was they also wanted the audience to take it seriously, and expected to copy the loyal cult grown fans that the fake Spinal Tap has in real life, not realizing that those fans took a decade of people loving that movie as a comedy and simply really getting into the music that is throughout that entire movie.  It’s hard to manufacture pop culture cult followings.  But thats what Garth tried to do.   Bowie’s original Ziggy stardust was early in his career during an avant garde era where he fit in fine along side Andy Warhol and all the excesses of the 70s.  By the time Bowie revisited his 1996 crime noir industrial techno concept album, his fans were pretty use Bowie being Bowie, treating his albums like unfamiliar adventures.  Country music had nothing like that, and Garth mentioning Bowies influence to his more blue grass country base fell on deaf ears. What probably did it in though was his SNL appearance.  Again the articles and such leading up they didn’t hide it was him and especially for SNL wanted you in on the joke of it.  Like if the wizard greated Dorthy and her gang as the great magnificent Wizard while also opening the curtain he is hiding behind and giving one of those just kidding winks to the Tin man.  So when the performance was by many watching the worst musical guest in recent SNL history, his fans were not clamoring to get on board with Chris Gaines.  I remember buying the album listening to it on my diskman on the bus ride home, than placing it on my CD storage tower where it only moved when I needed to pack up and move all my music somewhere else.  And this sediment was pretty much across the board.   Best described this way.  Remember Game of Thrones when they had huge episodes with major plot twists.  And everywhere you go if it’s really good all you hear about it was how good it was, and how when the show had a poorly received episode (like the final season) it seemed to spread to everyone you knew even faster.   That was even before facebook, what happened with Chris Gaines.  The movie never came out because the people that wanted to put money into the movie backed out.   It wanted you to take Chris Gaines seriously but treated it like a joke.  Hey went too hard on manufacturing the persona, while also making sure you knew it was just a persona.    He over promoted it and probably should have worked on the music more.    But at the end of the day he wasn’t crazy, he just saw Bowie doing something and went, god I wish I could do that.  Problem was he didn’t have a wealth of music he had already inside him that he just couldn’t release as Garth Brooks fans without pulling a Sergeant Pepper moment. His inspiration was too much based on simply wanting to do it not the authenticity of being in a position of actually needing to do it.
I thought this was going to be about Onision trying to do country music.
It was for a movie 🤦
Misheard “Darth Brooks” lol
Tell me if I’m wrong, but Garth Brooks calling himself the #1 top selling solo artist in the U.S. is misleading. The metric he’s using is wholesale (discounted bulk shipments to businesses to sell on) not retail sales.  i.e. if you make enough copies and sell them in bulk through business deals, you’re going to be high selling. It doesn’t mean the same sales figures to consumers who are actually buying them, in that metric he’s 5th.
How did no one notice that weirdest was spelt wrong 😭
Damn I thought you were collaborating with Patrick CC in the beginning  there.....😂😂
Oh I remember this BS... lol he did pretend it wasn't him.
G is a horrible man when they found out what he did he’s gonna see time, where’s the body’s Garth?
chris gaines looks like an onision personality
He was Hannah Montanaing
The movie sounds like it would’ve been funny. I wish it came out
Definitely seems like a weird thing to do" says the guy that did the same thing TWICE EVEN
Someone show danny the Taylor Swift music video the man... get him to guess where she is in the music video
I was 13 when this Chris Gaines nonsense happened. My older sister and I had gone to Walmart and she saw the album for sale. We knew nothing about the project, she just saw that it was clearly Garth Brooks, who she liked, and it said his name on the cover, so she bought it and we listened to it on the ride home. I remember her saying it wasn’t bad. Thankfully, I do not remember the music at all.
I feel like this is where Zoolander got his iconic look and poses like Magnum and Letigre .
Lol was just about to look up Garth, what a strange name (no offense to the Garth's out there! just your moms, like, what are u doing? Lol)
Where are the bodies Garth?!
My mom says there was a Behind the Music for Chris Gaines
I thought he jokingly put Onision in the thumbnail
Changing styles as an artist is tough, especially when you’re a country artist. One of the best examples of this is honestly Taylor Swift. She’s managed to be relevant for over a decade and has made a slow shift of her style in a way that I really respect. Obviously not as dramatic a shift as Chris Gaines, but still impressive.
Why did he disguise himself as onision?
Where are the bodies, Garth?
Garth Brooks obviously felt what Ricky Nelson was saying in his song "Garden Party" "...Played them all the old songs, thought that's why they came. No one heard the music, we didn't look the same..." "Well it's all right now, I learned my lesson well... see you can't please everyone, so you've got to please yourself..."
I remember this. And knew immediately at the thumbnail 😅
Ooh idk about the Austin Butler becoming Elvis thing, wonder if that would be an entertaining video
Can’t believe Eminem was allowed to be Slim Shady in this same time period and Garth Brooks can’t have his own dumb public alter-ego.  I know it’s different, but we were also culturally primed for this kind of thing.
@YMHStudios   The plot thickens
Crazy how i always thought SNL WAS the best show you can be watching in the 90s i just didnt get it, now i get why i will NEVER like it SNL SUIUUCKED other then the 4 Chris Farley Funny minutes and its literally that 4 minutes thats it
Darth Brooks
Chris Gaines is Garth Brooks' Tulpa
Danny being 30 is not something i expected to find out today
his alt looks like V from Devil May Cry
4:02 kelvin & hughes brass compass enjoyer
Even Eminem made fun of Garth Brooks... I've personally never listened to Garth, but I've always known him to be a very popular country singer. I think his stuff is cliche and sub par, but I guess more people liked him than I thought. I had no idea he had that award status. I just knew him as a 90s country staple.
Everything I know about Garth comes from Louis CK 😂
Pretty sure MJ destroyed his record of solo albums sold lol
Oh my god. I seriously remember this happening. People were genuinely confused. I'm not sure that there was even a genuine attempt to even explain what happened.
Why is Garth Brooks cosplaying Onision
Percy thrills thrillington
Took me half this time to read the Wikipedia.  Basically he did this for a movie that was never made.  Had the movie been made this wouldn't confuse so many people.  I remember at the time he even said this in interviews, that he was doing this for a movie, and then it never happened.  How much did you pay Robert to look this up on wikipedia?
Chris Gaines knows where Garth hid the bodies.
Minus the movie thing Danny Worsnop basically did this in reverse lmao
Darth Brooks LOL
I was in high school when Garth switched to Chris Gaines and honestly really liked a lot of the cd even though I was not a fan of Garth’s country music. I hate that he got so much shit for it because to me it took a lot of guts to do what he did and he did a great job. The only thing I found weird was Chris Gaines backstory. Garth should have just been himself and put the cd out. I say this because in 1999 music was starting to cross over a lot. You started seeing a lot of white pop stars having rappers on their remixes, the Latin explosion (Ricky Martin, Mark Anthony, Jlo, Enrique Iglesias), and a huge resurgence of Reggae. He could have gotten way more songs to chart just by being himself. Yes he would have pissed off some of his fans but he definitely would have gained a lot more fans that normally wouldn’t listened to his music. Like for instance I became a huge fan of Reba McEntire after I watched her TV show.
No offense Danny, but it is such a millennial/Gen z thing to not know who Garth Brooks is or the style of 90s rock artist lol.
I THOUGHT THE THUMBNAIL WAS NIKKI SIXX
Onision looking ass...
This is such an integral part of my childhood as a southerner who's mom loves garth brooks still to this day
At the height of her fame as author of the Harry Potter books, J. K. Rowling put out a detective novel under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. I think she was hoping it would be a best seller. It wasn’t but reviewers said it seemed to be professionally written for a first book. So the publisher released rumors that the author is actually J. K. Rowling and it became a best seller.
Maybe he was just tired of playing country music all the time. I know I get tired of listening to it within the first five minutes.
I don't understand how this is a 'rock star'? His music sounds like enya or maybe a pop artist. He looks a little like Hinder or Green Day but music is just him signing with very soft guitar and drums.
Did you KNOW?  Uh Yeah  I knew  everyone at the time knew.  Hell he didn't hide it cause he knew we were going to laugh even harder at Garth if he tried to hide it.  Trouble is he didn't know just how hard we would laugh without him hiding it.
Chris Gains: Mind Freak.
Where is the interview where he says the other 5 albums have to come out? I can't find it :/
You never watched Wayne's World? Garth Algar? Shhhhwwwwing!  Oh, come on...
As a Brit the more I hear about Garth Brooks the more I think he's fictional. The best selling artist of all-time yet no one I know has ever heard of him. Comes up with a random alter ego at the height of his career. Said alter ego gives him his first top 40 hit despite selling a bajillion records previously. And I swear to god that low places song sounds like a parody of country music, like what a local UK comedian would come up with for a skit. So forget Chris Gaines I'm convinced Brooks himself is a just an elaborate troll Americans made up to confuse Europeans.
David Bowie did something similar. He created a fictive person, an alter ego that he named Ziggy Stardust. It worked quite well for David Bowie.
Have you not seen any of Tom Seguras very in-depth Garth Brooks  coverage?
Funny story-- Mariah Carey wanted to do the same thing, too. Seriously. A rock album called Someone's Ugly Daughter, credited to a band called Chick. She sang lead and co wrote and produced, but the label made her take her leads off and replace them with another singer. The background vocals are still hers though.
He has another Alt named Girth Brooks...
There’s a movie from the 80’s called, “Eddie and the Crusiers” where the theme song, “On the Dark Side” was sung by The Beaver Brown Band. If you ask people who released that song, many will tell you Eddie and the Cruisers.
Garth Brooks (Not his Chris Gains alter ego) actually changed country music and led it to be more pop than twang music.
Help I thought this was about Onision 😭
I must be old because I remember this. As I recall, Brooks let it be known that it was him. The whole thing looked ridiculous, and most of us just thought he was trying to look like Prince.
Maybe he was the bestselling country artist because Madonna has sold over 250 million albums and Elvis is 500 million so that’s way more than Garth
And BYE Sasha fierce? SCARLET? With this EXACT logic- you need to believe doja cat is a real demon.
Zoolander meets Savage Garden, meets Trent Reznor, meets Creed, meets smooth jazz.
Fr all jokes aside- our generation does look young af compared to the new one cause I thought u were 18
Um....no see those of us actually ALIVE back then knew what he was doing. It wasnt something in the shadows that failed. I mean the music failed...but it was announced and very well known.
The funniest part of this to me is that Danny has been on a song with a musician's alter ego, and I just have to assume that he doesn't know.  The lead singer of Waterparks, Awsten Knight, made an alter ego named Felony Steve. In 2019 Danny and "Felony Steve" were on the song "IHATEMETOO" by LIL PHAG together.  Awsten's music label made him take down the music he made as Felony Steve (aside from that song,) but someone reuploaded it on SoundCloud if you want to listen to it
WHERE ARE THE BODIES GARTH
This video is 17:38 long, I'm like hey what's up hello
Chris gaines was a great album
"Garth Brooks in Chris Gaines" i ship it
GB didn't get "caught immediately" or "try to change his identity and fail". This is clickbait.  What GB did is called a "Concept Album". Artists have been doing it for 50+ years.  The Beatles were one of the first with "Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", with each member taking on a different persona to, as PM put it, allow them more freedom to experiment.
i thought the chris gaines photo was onision dear god
All of that to just look like Onision bruh
Chris Gaines a.k.a Garth brooks' midlife crisis
How very Sasha Fierce of him
i want to see a movie based on Garth Brook’s Chris Gains phase played by Jared Leto
Also, there is the theory on all the missing persons and his tour dates matching up...
i can’t help but wonder something super irrelevant. say someone who was not previously famous came out with an alter ego and the public only knew them as such. would that character be considered “fictional” like chris gaines would or would it be considered just another celebrity
wait I went down the rabbit hole and wait so here in Australia we have a radio station that isnt a commercial station and very much loved generally by a younger crowd or people like myself that grew up with it called  Triple J  they do a thing called Like a version where they have an artist and they come perform a cover of what ever they like and OMG Childish Gambino aka Donald Glover sings Lost In You a song by Chris Gaines aka Garth Brooks 😂🤣 omg I love it that he performed a song of an alter ego artist as he is an alter ego artist so gold
Chris Gains sounds like a fitness influencer.
It was also done in the rap industry. There was a rapper named Shock G that went by the alter ego Humpty Hump. He made the hit song “the humpty dance “ under the Elias and people were confused on who he was. This rapper was part of the group digital underground which was also a group that Tupac  was apart of.
GenX remembers this 😂
No one mentions Chris Gaines is 100 lbs skinnier than Brooks? 😂
Bruh, 😂 1:53
Still better then the direction Kanye went...
cosplaying as Keith Urban has to be the funniest thing ever
I can't believe he didn't call the album Garth Brooks: Inside Chris Gaines...
Chris Gaines is what happens when an artist has made so much money for a label that they feel like they can't say no.
I’m old enough to remember this … I was like 8 but I remember everyone making fun of him for going emo basically. I never heard of the movie back story, I feel like that’s a lie. From what I remember it was his alter ego becuz he wanted to do other styles of music instead of country music.
You gotta respect his attempt at being a “rock star” by release his debut track that’s actually an easy listening, super layer back song that is in no way considered rock music!😂
Garth is an actual name. You've never watched Wayne's World? Party on Wayne. Party on Garth.
the Chris Gaines character was to have a movie attached to it but never got filmed/released.  The album was to be its soundtrack.  He was never trying to change his identity.
Where are the bodies Garth
Channel owner is prolly jealous , attempting to make something out of nothing.  Garth could buy and sell you, you worthless troll.....
I give him credit for trying something different!
damn i thought this dude just died
Garth Brooks world famous? No, just in the US. I only heard about him because I happened to spend some time in the States in '99.
Bulma! Her Dad's a Genius, Billionaire, Playboy & Philanthropist. She takes after him.   And I want to see what the stuff in the fridge tastes like.
Holy shit i did not know this, educational and entertaining 👌
Fan of Garth Brooks here. The song lost in you was redone in his regular style.
You should look into where are the bodies Garth. That’s another fun rabbit hole to go down.
i thought garth brooks was a serial killer or something
I wonder if Tom Segura knows about this.
My uncle actually wrote friends in low places… his name is Earl Bud Lee. He still plays shows in Nashville and other writers conventions 🤙
The Chris Gaines photo makes me think of on!s!on 🥴
Go watch Wayne's World. There's only one Garth you need to know.
I remember first finding this out because of a Family Guy reference😂
This video could be renamed to Danny doesn't understand.
So they just ask every GB fan hey was you confused and they were like yah wasnt you.
Im old like old and I had no idea He was this guy. Ya He as in the chosen one. I think of Chris Angle when I see Him. Wait did I just always think this was Chris Angle I dont know or care nevermind.
I remember when he was a gust on Muppets Tonight and the on going gag was that he wanted to do anything and everything that wasn’t singing a country song. Looking it up it was in 1996 so before all this but knowing about it makes that episode even funnier
Bro it's 99 there is no google.
"Country Musician Gets Bored, Does Onision Cosplay."
Robert Pattinson's Batman Vibes
2 things because I was a wee lad but remember this a little bit. Wasn’t he already with Trisha. I thought he pm separated from his first wife because of the trist with her. Also I specifically remember him doing an interview or something on a morning show and Garth said his favorite band was KISS. He always wanted to be a rockstar in vain of Paul and Gene and this is how he went about it.
My theory is Chris Gaines is his real identity and he was the original singer for the Goo Goo Dolls. After being kicked out for being TOO moody he changes to Garth and plans his life long revenge plot to take over the music industry and destroy John Rzeznik.
chris gaines and the terrible horrible no good very bad day
lol Danny looks a Pixar 3D animation
I love when an artist creates an OC and lives it
From what I hear, a lot of women have gone Missing right about the time Garth Brooks decides to come around and play a show in their town. Coincidence?   Or is he a murderer?  🤔
Danny hasn’t heard of Ashley-O 😂
adam yauch did this with his alter ego nathaniel hörnblowér lol
As fellow Okie like Garth Brooks I could so see myself doin the same thing
People please leave Garth Brooks alone.
People please leave Garth Brooks alone.
i thought that was trent reznor i cannot lie LOL
1:20 it's because people who listen to the worst music have the most money to spend on bad music 😂 I don't know a single person who even listens to Garth Brooks, let alone has paid money for any of his albums. But because some rich fangirl somewhere bought 20,000 copies of each of his albums woth her daddy's money from his heirloom cattle ranch business, he counts as the best selling solo artist. Even though way more people listen to Taylor Swift (not me but still, it's facts), all those people are children, or millenials working minimum wage and paying three times their monthly income in rent, so no one who listens to her can afford to buy all her albums. And you know more people listen to Michael Jackson, but again, normal people who like pop music don't have millions of dollars to throw away on a CD or vinyl. But people who love country are always the rich spoiled brats with tons of expendable income, usually from archaic businesses they keeo afloat by shunning safety and health regulations or animal abuse laws. Coal mines, cattle ranches, horse racing, dog racing, rodeo shows, plantations, coaching dumb jocks in football. Most careers synonymous with people who like country music are very lucrative especially if they're ignoring regulations, so these people have all the money to spend to support another rich guy who sings about beer and trucks all day.
I remember when this happened 😂😂😂
I am going to show my millennial age but…I don’t understand why or how Garth Brooks got so popular.
Garth Brooks was the Kanye West of country.  He’s had some pretty crazy moments.  Chris Gains, suddenly divorced his wife and steady family to marry Yearwood.  Retiring and selling the rights to all his music to Walmart at the peak of his career for a single box set.  The odd Facebook promo.  But I don’t think someone that had the energy he did could be totally sane.
Lol I genuinely thought your disguise that time would have worked if you did something a bit more to really change the look. I mean the cheeks were a great idea, change your face shape, and even the most defining features of the eyes and forehead by wearing a cap and glasses. But I bet if you had tried to mke your bodyweight look different or applied a fake tan, it might have tricked more people.
CG is the greatest thinG EVER
I thought the thumbnail was Notch and Onion Boy 😭
I would love to see what would have happened if he waited just a few more years during the peak of the emo craze.
I remember Walmart having the Chris Gaines postcards at the register back then. Everyone knew it was Garth but trying something new…it was weird, lasted very shortly and not a big deal.
He is NOT the vest seling artist he cheated and it doesnt count, fun fact
Where are the bodies garth?
i died on 47 in nine circles cuz of u cuh
This is just 1999’s Aaron West and the Roaring Twenties
“In 1999, I was 5 years old”  Bro… YOU’RE OLDER THAN ME??
The only thing Chris gained was tragedy. Thanks God he never existed.
Garth who?
The serial unaliver theory of Garth brooks looks even more strange with this info.
lol his behind the music was THE BEST
The SNL skit with mango where he admits it was all a trick to get mango to fall in love with him was perfect… weird, but perfect
his alter ego just looks like Trent Reznor from that same year, which just makes me think that his idea of a cool guy look is just something he came up with when he saw Trent and how much of a "bad boy" he was, cause I mean just look up Trent in 1999, Trent and Chris are just the same guy, but different music genre
Chris Gaines looks like onision
help me Chris Gaines looks like Onision with a goatee and sounds like a 13 year old's first oc
Looks like Criss Angel x Billy Ray Cyrus
LOLOL the Austin Butler call out was funny! He's *still* pretending that's his normal talking voice.
That's literally not what happened, they were making a movie and he was supposed to play Chris Gaines, and the studio had him record an album as the character for the soundtrack. The film never got released and they allowed him to release the music.
i remember Chris Gains, my mother called him out the first time she saw his face
15:31 "i love you chris im your biggets fuann :)"
Why does this kid have 2.1 million subscribers
I need to watch that VH1 episode now
“Caught immediately” has me HOWLING 😂😂😂
Basically it’s like Donald Glover and Childish Gambino 😤
Robert's a comedian
Lost in You is a bop tbh
Should hook up and start touring with ‘August is Falling’
all i'd previously known about garth brooks and chris gaines was from mbmbam, so this was a fun extension on the lore. one of their final yahoos that lives in my heart is "chris gaines and garth brooks...cousins?"
Chris Gaines looks like onision!
Seeing this happen was hilarious. NO ONE was tricked. We all knew it was him!
ugh I wish youd either put a flashing warning tag in your videos or not suddenly start using themI just had a seizure
Every time someone says "a super famous person", it's guaranteed I've never heard or seen the person before.
When Gaines returns, women will start going missing again....just watch...or maybe he has  multiple egos....lol
Thought this was gonna be about onision
Thunder road and Rodeo are banger songs though
Neck hickey?
“GAIRETH??” ITS GARRETH >:[
He Hannah Montanaed
Some Taylor Swift fans still don’t realize that she plays the brunette mean girl in You Belong With Me, so I feel like she could trick us if she tried really hard
Some of you have never heard of "This is Spinal Tap" and it shows.
Chris Gains isnt Bigfoot, Megan the Stallion is
The best part of this that was forgotten is that his fans weren’t really “confused”, but there was a segment of people who literally thought he sold his soul and “became” Chris Gaines. Before people thought Sasha Fierce was a demon channeled by Beyonce, they thought Chris Gaines was one.
Is it just me or does he look JUST like the lead singer of the RHCP from the 90s. i havent seen a picture of him in a while but thats like the vivid memory i have for whatever reason lol
Ha
I fully thought that was onision in the thumbnail
Your friend looks like Dave Franco. No offense
The whole Chris Gaines thing probably would have worked if the movie had actually been made and it was a comedy/mockumentary thing like This Is Spinal Tap or the Weird Al biopic. Maybe some other huge artist in the future will try this idea and do it properly.  On a similar topic, a lot of people thought at one time that Vessel from Sleep Token was a known guy who was putting a disguise on so he could release stuff that was very different from what they were known for (a lot of people thought he was Hozier for a while, or Rob Damiani from Don Broco).
Country music is rife with "ghost written" stuff. Country music is full of songwriters who songs are popularized by other singers. Country music albums often feature multiple songwriters which may or may not include the singer themselves. This is a common feature in other kinds of pop music as well.
Where are the bodies Garth?
Danny, Garth wasn't trying to hide his identity or pretend it wasn't him. He just wanted to try something different (and weird) because he got bored of being so famous and rich as Garth, that he wanted to try something else. Still weird af, but he wasnt trying to hide the fact that it was him
Garth Brooks was auditioning for Morbius
I remember when he did this and I don’t think he ever tried to hide it. If he did it failed so quickly no one ever knew. My memory is it was his attempt to switch up his style. The SNL thing was obviously a bit
Damn I thought the second guy in the thumbnail was Onision
Is Robert that comedian guy I keep seeing on you tube shorts or am I crazy 💀
Dude, I found a Chris Gaines cd one time and the white sticker on the edge said Garth Brooks 😂
I'm going fucking insane over 7:41 oh my god hahahahaha
Yeah “how are people taking the album” well they think it’s the greatest joke of all time “oh.”
So apparently I’ve lived through most of “chris gains” backstory > extorted by my former manager for 250k >house burned down > lost my best friend in a accident   Im just gonna bill myself in a video game though
There’s changing your style as a musician and then there’s having a mid life crisis, and I think this is the later. Also it’s so funny because ‘Chris Gaines’ reminds me of a real artist I had a crush on as a teenager… very “how do you do fellow kids” I mean he has the look but the sound isn’t there. But this is before the others got famous, perhaps Chris Gaines is the original
I remember this, I was a bit older. Garth Brooks was insanely popular in the 90s. It's hard to imagine, but it seemed like everyone was listening to him back then. His concerts were like 80s rock concerts.   By 1999 he was still huge but not at the peak. Tim McGraw took over the top spot in country by then.

Im still here prototype
You say Taylor Swift could never get away with this, yet tonnes of people didn’t realise she played the brunette girlfriend in You Belong With Me
1738 ay im like hey whats up hello
You will fool my face blind ass 9 times out of 10 I'm not gonna lie. Someone at work wore a wig once and I passed by them literally 3 times trying to find them.
It was a pretty good stunt back in the day.
He was not trying to trick people and hide behind hair lmao. Lots of artists were doing weird looks like that at the time.
ethel cain too has been there done that
Danny reading through these articles that have like word minimums is such mind-numbing content lmao  At least you've got your spin and hypotheticals on it, but hearing all that generic prose is rough!
Actually Lana del Rey/Lizzy grant did this the best
It was for a movie that never happened
Garth Vader
Holy shit! I was around when this happened and watching young people discover this is amazing. I'm 30 seconds into the video and I can't wait to watch this.
I was there. I was there when Chris Gaines mysteriously appeared and more importantly, I was there when he disappeared.
I was THE Garth Brooks fan back then, and it's really strange hearing this version of it.   We weren't all that confused back then, we knew there was supposed to be a movie, we knew it was him. Maybe that was just because I was such a big fan, but I didn't buy the CD thinking it was someone other than Garth Brooks. The confusing part was where the movie went, it was on the way, on the way, on the way... and then just never happened. The songs were okay, not great but okay. I remember 2 I liked.   So basically they released a soundtrack and then never made the movie. And now it is just one of those things that you had to be there to believe.   Truthfully, what turned me off on him was not the album, it was the very open affair with Trisha Yearwood when he was not only married but had 3 babies... but jokes on me, he and Trisha are still married, so that's where being judgmental gets you.
Technically Taylor did that for the Man music video. Not really but close enough😅
How have I never noticed how pretty Danny’s eyes are? They look like the turquoise water in the Caribbean. (I’m faded rn and I spent the whole video trying to determine if they were edited or not)
Wait. Chris gaines looks exactly like one of my ocs wtf
Party on Wayne. I'm so disappointed in you.
Chris Gaines was actually the original name of my fitness channel but I thought it was a little too on-point so ended up just using my real name Max N. Wayts….so, if you actually stumbled across this buried comment yep, that’s right. You’re reading a comment from THE Max Wayts 🤘🏼max on
14:28 a plane crash? was that gonna be in the movie? 😭
12:28 wait isn’t Chris Gaines supposed to be a Rock star? 😅
FOR THOSE WHO HAVENT BEEN GARTH BROOKS FANS FOR DECADES.   From Wikipedia:   “Chris Gaines is a one-off fictional rock persona created as a movie character for Garth Brooks to explore musical styles far removed from his success as a country singer.  Initially, Brooks planned to feature the Gaines persona in The Lamb, a motion picture that never materialized. In 1999, Brooks released Garth Brooks in...the Life of Chris Gaines, his only album as Gaines. The album produced two charting Billboard singles, including the top 5 pop hit "Lost in You".”
9:07 Danny out of context 😂
6:49 okay but if _all_ the fans were confused, then they didn’t do a good job with marketing 😅
4:38 NGL was waiting for a Hannah Montana reference 😂
1:38 to this day??? kinda crazy when i’ve never even _heard_ of this guy 😭
1:09 yeaah i never heard of him either 😅
Nody used google in 1999. A lot of people didn’t even have the internet at their house almost no one used google lol it hadnt even been around a full year at this point and no one even hardly knew of it yet lol
Buuuuut its actually good music 😅 his singing is gorgeous in Lost In You
9:36 taylor sheesh
I remember this. I was 12 at the time.
genuinely thought that the thumbnail was onision...
Garth Brooks accidentally created Onision in 1999 and the world has not been the same since.
@16:54 Not the interviewer calling him Chris Grains🤣
paul zimmer pt 2
Wasn't this the plot to a Disney show didn't Disney invite this 😂
You should take more vitamin E,D,K A and B12. Peace and love
It's so funny to me that "number 1 country music artist in the usa" equals to the number one artist of the world 😂
danny maybe you should retry the alter ego video but add blurs. i think it’d probably work much better!
This is nonsense. It was for a movie that was never released.
Garth Brooks has also been an outspoken LGBTQ+ ally for over thirty years. He put out a song about it in 1993 called "We Shall Be Free" that won a GLAAD award. He says it was bc his late sister, Betsy, was a lesbian.
I still need to know wtf they did for the snl transition...
When danny presented robert i knew we will get another " I disgusied myself as my own emplyee" video soon
6:13  That might as well be L from Death note 👀
That "Garth" wikipedia article read like a Lewis Carrol poem
I looked up the claim that he’s the #1 selling solo artist of the US but I don’t see that claim on any reputable sites. Every reputable sight has Elvis as #1 with $500 million in sales up until Drake recently dethroned him with $523 million in sales. After those two it’s Michael Jackson at 400 million,  Rihanna at 363 million, Eminem at 331 million and a few more very well known names that make far more sense to be at the top of that list lol.
Is that robert Schultz?
Garth Brooks cosplaying as Chris Cornell.  Two absolute legends I loved equally in my early teens.  I don’t remember this being a huge deal when it happened, but in 1999 I was pretty consumed with worry that the Y2K bug was going to end the world.
barf brooks🪶
Good timing consider Garth and Trisha have a docuseries coming out about their new bar in Nashville.
more stupid click bait! You should have done your research on this. He was not trying to change his identity. This was part of a movie. Garth was writing the soundtrack for a movie and ultimately the movie never came to be. So since he had done all the work for the soundtrack he released it under the name of the main character of the movie. HAHA more you tube fake B.S.!!!
At first glance I thought that Chris Gaines was Onision…
My mom had this album when I was a kid. The liner notes had photos of fictional album covers that his character released years prior. It was like Spinal Tap, minus the comedy.
Ghost write deez nuts
From the moment I saw the thumbnail and even after the video was over, can't unsee Gaines as Adam Gontier with a soul patch. It's even more accurate for his younger self
Missed opportunity to call his dark brooding alter ego, Darth Brooks
Iirc the fact they were the same person was well known. People were used to celebrities doing weird stuff at the time, especially musicians, i.e Prince and the whole symbol thing.
Maybe Chris Gaines was The Unknown
i know danny joked about it, but taylor swift did change her look for "the man" music video where she looked like a man, then revealed at the end it was her, and it did shock people. like i get the joke, but it did happen
But.. he didn’t try to change his identity..? Everyone knew who he was, it’s just a pen name
11:30 Chris Gains is the friends we made along the way, obviously
Ever so often i remember this and have to tell someone remember that Garth Brooks created Chris Gaines and never broke character or just made a rock album as himself
I'm starting to feel a bit suspicious about this guy Robert...
Yes ❤ I’d listen and Ik the vid would be 🔥
Couldn't help but think of Ben Stiller fooling around when "Chris Gaines" started singing on SNL.
I think Robert might be James Franco.
chris gains is kinda giving oli london
Feels like the guy saw a picture of Chris Angel once.
He didn't fail, people legit thought he was a new artist at first lol and he was still also Garth Brooks. He was just doing a fun side thing. I think you were just a baby when it happened
I thought this video was about MGK for a second but then I realized you said musician in the title
He looks like Chris Angel
Never heard of this guy
They tried to make him this mysterious and dark rock star but had him play the most bland dentist office music imaginable.
It seems like he just wanted to be someone else for a bit. Have a alter ego. Also. He was cyncial and suspicious about the music industry. So he made a parody. David Bowie had several alter egos. His wierd stuff was made to annoy the company he was tied to for 5yrs.   Garth Brooks himself. Maybe they wouldnt let him go as far as he wanted.  So he looked at his name and made Chris Gaines sound like he was percieved to be. But behave in a cliche wild way.
Danny, the part you missed is that Garth had been green-lit to produce the music for the upcoming film. He went whole hog, and the studio backed out because of "projection of sales". Mr. Brooks is an all or nothing kinda guy, and he gave it his all, and it failed. End of story.
Girth Brooks, porn actor..
Thr irony of the names is. Garth Brooks sounds more hardcore than Chris Gaines. Maybe Garth Brooks always wanted to be more hardcore than he could be.
My mom who famously hates country music loves Garth Brooks (even went to one of his shows) and I remember when my parents told me about Chris Gaines and I felt like I was hallucinating
How did he sell more than Michael Jackson? Lol oh yeah it’s because he didn’t. Lol
Childish Gambino covered that Chris Gaines song on triple j once. What an insane back story.
I thought the picture on the right of the thumbnail was onision 💀
This reminds me of Joe Keery as Djo literally a modern day hannah montanna 💀💀
I love the Chris Gaines album but the persona and backstory were so over the top, they should have just leaned into the parody aspect of it, like Spinal Tap. The last line of the VH1 Behind the Music was Chris Gaines saying “I think if my dad were alive he would say I’m proud of you…and get a haircut.”  I mean, that’s funny!
re: the Taylor Swift analogy- we’d all think it was another Easter egg for TS12.
In 1999 you wouldn’t have gooled yourself, you would have AOL’d or Yahoo’d yourself.
Whenever you upload me and my mom and my brother watch you, you are seriously the best.
I remember when this happened, my mom was a huge Garth fan, bought the album we all ragged on her bc it was so cringe lol
11:30
Lol garth brooks started the emo look
The irony of Chris Gains being internationally known and no one outside of the USA having heard of Garth Brookes 😂
My boy, I BEEN on telling people about Chris Gaines! Nobody ever knows and I always blow people’s minds. You have taken this from me….
Danny it wasnt his biggest song of all time, it just charted on a different chart cuz it wasnt his usual country.
It's called actor based reality. Garth is not the only celeb to play two characters on the world stage. He just got caught.
Let Garth have his emo phase
I think Ned Flames needs to make more music
Garth Brooks’ lead guitarist, Johnny Garcia, recently saw my husband play live with his band and said he’s destined to be an amazing bassist :) My husband bled all over his bass in preparation for this performance and had only been playing bass for a WEEK. He compared his stage presence and performance to Ben Shephard (Soundguard’s bassist). If you’re interested in the band, they’re called August Lows :)
I vaguely remember this. Everyone thought he was a sellout 😂
It’s giving onision trying to be trent reznor
Hi Danny
As someone who listens to country music regularly and knows the significance of Garth Brooks in country music, I honestly cannot believe he did this and that TRISHA YEARWOOD wrote the songs lmaoooo. If he wouldn’t have told everyone immediately that it was him I would’ve thought it was a totally different guy.
His alter ego looks like onision on the thumbnail
The Chris Gaines quadrangle callback is fucking genius!
I was in my mid 20s when this happened.  It was very early internet but we were still able to LAUGH FOREVER into the abyss about this.
I confused dude with James blunt. So James blunt is real?
Danny being shocked that Garth brooks married a woman that he worked with and was friends with when Danny married the first woman who every talked to him. lol
Garth Brooks foot reveal
After his father was murdered in 1993, Michael Jordan quit basketball for a while to play baseball. I think that’s part of the context here. Plus, Brooks was an impressionable 22 years old when This is Spinal Tap came out. I’m guessing Brooks was testing the waters as an actor, not as a rock star, and that the movie was… not intended to take itself too seriously.
i got friends ien LaOW placeus
I bet you think Spinal Tap is real too…
Thanks Robert
I thought that was onision
We know ur Garth brooks danny
Goth Brooks
Lordi have released music/albums that were supposedly historical. The _Lordiversity_ collection imagines Lordi released albums as far back as the 60s and 70s. Of course they didn't , but it's part of their shtick.
Danny’s been popping videos out like he POPPED a child out 😂👍
Didn’t Joaquin Phoenix do some shit like this? lol
Thought that Garth was just using an Onision pic to cathfish ppl.
Garth Brooks OC
that looks like fucking Onision
We are to believe Garth Brooks was going to do a movie with an AUSTRALIAN ACCENT? No way that’s real
Where are the bodies Garth?
i am shocked that i have NEVER heard about this before today  edit after watching: he was so iconic for this
Never heard the name Garth?   Is Wayne's World a joke to you?
I have a "Where are the bodies Garth" shirt! That whole conspiracy is my favorite thing ever.
Michael Scott's Gorillaz
You don't even prep your own content anymore, Danny. This is lazy and it isn't worth watching.
People really listen to him... Man...
DANNY CAN YOU REACT TO AO3 FANFICTIONS OF YOU
So, as having lived though this whole event, which many of you were not around for (Xers are the new Boomers, I guess?), this was something that was seen as a failed genre-hop by bigger muckety mucks than Brooks. The movie, the album, it was all contrived to be a persona that Brooks was not and the fans reacted accordingly. Garth is still a good dude, and Country music is getting better because of people like Beyonce. I love country music, but I'm tired of seeing us represented by assholes like Toby Keith and Morgan Wallen. FWIW: If you haven't seen Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs perform Fast Car at the Grammys, go watch it now.
In the 90s my mom had one of Garth's cassettes and we played it to death while delivering mail.
I still listen to circus by fox szn  great song
Oml I thought this video was going to be about Onision trying to make music under a fake name but that the only thing he used to conceal his identity was a fake goatee and some eyeliner
Just heard his music as Chris and I must say, it’s quite nice
Where’s the bodies Garth
He wasn't trying to trick people.
I was 28 when this happened and it was just like the x files!  You nailed it.  The 90s was the most wonderfully weird decade
i thought that was literally onision in the thumbnail oh my god
10:30 why does it look like he’s blushing like an anime girl
5:46 The funny thing about the Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus comment… They put out an album called Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus lol
Garth Brooks has got to be some sorta Greek god cuz he just never misses. Pretty great western swing   N just a great guy in general pretty great artist who didn't take shit from the industry. Love him to death n can't wait to hear more about this when he inevitably shows up on cocaine and rhinestones
It's rare I find a new channel that I actually wanna subscribe to. Good job man.
you’re telling me that’s not onision????
No love for Ned Flames?
Michael Jackson?
He gives Snape
Was he experiencing psychosis or some shit 😭
I cry-laughed thru most of this 😂😂
His real first name is Troyal
Garth Brooks is a very important figure in my household cause when my older brother was 5 he cut out Garth Brooks face from a magazine and created a toilet paper roll angel that now sits on top of the family Christmas tree every year
On the other spectrum, we have Filthy Frank & Joji, which works well for Joji
Garth brooks went through his emo phase a little later than most people 🤣🤣
The subtitles saying "Darth brooks" killed me I can't stop laughing
Garth Brooks is still the shit. I dont even love country. I still couldnt tell you what the hell the chris gaines thing was but i remember the music video and i think the single was for a movie? Dont remember it coming out.. I also remember garth brooks on snl, playing both himself and chris. It was...odd. Honestly, man was still selling full stadiums.. Lort. Ok. I confirm everything danny is saying. This happened and this is how we all felt about it. Celebrities had a rough time back in 99
Chris Gaines looks like Onision 😂
Danny described Taylor Swift in both roles of the You Belong With Me music video without realizing it 😂
Fun fact his first name is Troyal
I like to imagine Danny has seen Garth Brooks & Chris Gaines in the same room, Chris Gaines & Chip Gaines in the same room, and Chip Gaines & Garth Brooks in the same room.
WHERE ARE THE BODIES GARTH?????
Chris Gaines is looking just like onision
Uhhh Wayne and Garth... Garth is totes a name. A weak one but a name none the less
Yooo my grandpa works for Garth! He’s so cool I love him
I have the same birthday as garth brooks
if Miley Cyrus can do it with Ashley O then Garth Brooks can do it with Chris Gaines
if it was a bit i found it pretty funny
Where are the bodies Chris Gaines?
Bro was slim shady before slim shady
ROBERT MENTIONED🗣️‼️‼️
Should’ve called himself Darth brooks
14:30 me making my oc as fukwe up as possible
Garth Brooks ARG
Fixxer upper mention i lovs that show
Why does Chris Gains look like PBG
This video made me unironically love the Gaines album lol
Guys this 2 Danny 2 Furious guy kinda looks like Danny
Where are the bodies Garth?
he was so ahead of his time
Every wattpad x reader writer be like: 13:27
It also doesn't help that he cheated on her.... So.....
LMAOO I KNEW IT WAS GARTH BROOKS WHEN I SAW YOU UPLOADED IT
Can u tell me who this Robert guy is ? I can't find his youtube channel or anything ☹️☹️
i kind of love it electra heart could never
I'm Southern and I asked my dad if he knew that Garth Brooks had an alter ego and he just casually said "yeah Chris Gaines" like that's not actually insane
He wasn’t even close to biggest seller of all time. This thing you are reading seems to be written by his team
He was not the guy.
These records you are showing are country records , not pop no one outside country new him
❤
Garth brooks was never one of the most famous people anywhere.
When the Chris Gaines album came out… it did NOT say Garth Brooks on it at all.
Where are the body’s Garth?? The families NEED closure!!
Now check out new wave band The Network. They are definitely not Green Day.
Green Day did this (but like. we all knew. and they all knew we knew. and we all knew they knew we knew) they put out an album “Money Money 2020” under the name The Network in like….2008? it was during their American Idiot era and it’s wild and weird and they’re all in ski masks and it’s GREAT
Why does he look like Onision though....?
"weirdest" was spelled wrong js 😅
The friends stuck in a well hit me so hard😂
My pet theory is that the Chris Gaines 'project' was just a clever cover for something that would have been even more damaging to Garth's career.  I think he WAS going to make The Lamb, but it was an idea pitched to him by some Evangelicals wanting to make a movie, and it was going to be an outright movie-length Chick Tract about Chris Gaines the troubled, sex addicted rock star finding Jesus. Then almost immediately, people around Garth were like "Yo dude you CANNOT make that, I know it sounds like a great idea but your religion isn't a huge part of your image and you're going to look like a joke to lot of fans who aren't Evangelicals." So Garth had to backpedal like hell and make it all look like some elaborate stunt to hide one move that was much more straightforward but way more embarrassing.
pov you don’t listen to mbmbam
we love Robert
Garth Brooks was so popular, The Dance was the theme of my prom. We weren't even a really "county" high school.
When celebrities makes an OC
I can't believe I'm the only one who thinks that chris gaines album cover looks like onision, I'm going insane
my grandpa’s name is garth. hope this helps!
danny explaining to me a celebrity shitpost while i eat my oatmeal
Why does the new him look like onision lol
Is sex really the best things about being a musician? Today kids, our genius and the leader of the fastest growing fan base on YouTube( don’t look it up, it is named Greg and is infact the fastest growing), is going to answer our question. Also, please, turn to page 245 and write all notes down there, as this will be necessary for your assessment. Please name it ‘I’m Barf Grooks’.
Genuinely thought that was Onision
Danny: "Has he ever seen a rockstar before? He looks like a cult leader..."   Every rockstar ever trying to start a sex cult: "shhhhh nobody tell him"
i think garth was trying to give elliott smith, but really poorly
I totally thought it was onision in the thumbnail....
Chris Gains gives me gender envy
Why’d I think the picture of his alter ego was accidentally Onision? 💀😂😂😂😂
They're trying to mandela effect Chris Gaines. Acting like it was all a goof for a movie. Not at all the case. Back then, there was no talk about a movie.
I think about this frequently and was waiting for more people to remember this happened!
BARF BOOKS
who wanna tell danny about the music video for the man by taylor swift
Does Danny know about Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus
Danny I know you’re trying to cover up something
Lol. Danny you are literally 1% as famous as Garth. His failures are more successful than your highest accolades.
he became onision
wierdest
james chapeskie, fox szn, and chris gaines need to collab 😍😍
Why does his alter ego look like onision lol
What do you mean fails? I remember this being a big deal lol.
the dude on the right looks like onision from the thumbnail and that right there is a red flag
i genuinely thought the picture of “chris gaines” in the thumbnail was onision
Chris Gaines resembles onision a little too much
Tbh I love that the length of the video is 17:38
Thank you robertttttt
can’t wait for the chris gaines x fox szn x zayden longzan collab to drop
Danny, respectfully,  wtf happened to your neck? Were you attacked by animal or something?
I left this video more confused than when I clicked on it and I can't tell if I was supposed to
Wow me being from Kansas and Garth Brooks being my favorite artist of all time, and Danny being my favorite Danny of all time I LOVE THISSSSS
We love Robert ❤
i cant wait for chris gaines! 🤣
same vibes as Joe Keery continuing to post as Kurt Kunkle for like 2 years after the movie was released lmao
Is that a THREAT Mr Brookes???
I KNOW YOU KISSED MY GRANDPA😡😡😡
Clearly, someone has never seen Wayne's World! Is Garth a real name?!? Haha
Thought the thumbnail was onision till I saw the soul patch
Wait stop… my mom had a Chris Gaines CD. You tellin me that was just Garth Brooks??? How did I not know this lmao …Ok you can continue now
where are the bodies GARTH???!!! the families want to know!!!!
12:10 why is the backstory part unintentionally hilarious??
I was 15 when this happened. It was a weird time.
Garth Brooks is from Brooks and Dunn.❤
So, was Garth brooks trying to make a biopic about a fictional rock star that he was attempting to convince the world was a real person? And whatever the original vision for it was got kind of discarded based on public reception? But that ended up being fine because it was genuinely just an excuse to cosplay as his OC?
PLEASE collab with layze or I might die (unknown)
Garth Brooks is my childhood idol!
14:43 if my life was a movie it'd be like that life just keeps screwing me over and I just can't catch a break
11:21 it doesn't even sound like rock the instromentals are so light and he's like whispering the lyrics I am now convinced he doesn't even know what rock music is or sounds like
7:50 what the hell is a coloister I think I slipped into an alternate reality
6:13 dude you just said what i was just thinking
Absolutely insane how many times "Graines" is accidentally said
Yikes.
1:23 my gma loved Garth brooks but I didn’t know about this 😂😂 how strange
ngl i forgot that garth brooks is famoue because my dad is friends with him
Is Chris Gaines not just Keith Urban? 😂
"They're filming chris gaines like he's bigfoot" hahahahahah danny
DANNY I GENUINELY LOVE CIRCUS IT SLAPS LMAO
just wait until danny finds out about hannah montana’s 2007 album “meet miley cyrus”
i love garth brooks
Rap song: Bat Ballz (Featuring Chris Gaines, Jr.) by Col. Patson
where are the bodies garth??
We need an emo Danny skit
Why do I feel like every big artist is the number one artist in one demographic or another
GB also had a rap song
WAY TO GO LITTLE BOY, YOU DUG UP SOME OLD ASS SHIT FROM DADDY'S CLOSET LOL LOOK AT YOU DISCOVERING OLD SHIT AND GOSSIP. WOW INTERESTING OLD ASS GOSSIP YOU JUST DISCOVERED LOL
Wow. You are practically an infant. That's hilarious you just learned about Garth trying to become a Chris Lol you actually think you discovered a new thing but just like Columbus YOU FOUND SOME OLD SHIT AND CLAIM YOU JUST FOUND IT  LOL LOL LIKE A LITTLE BOY THAT DOESN'T EVEN SHAVE YET. YOU EVEN LOOK PREPUBESCENT TOO
what is a cloister 😭😭
I was in college when this happened, and I never got the impression he was serious about "hiding" that Gaines was really Garth Brooks. It was very much done with a wink. Also, it's really hard to communicate just how huge Garth Brooks was at the time. He was unquestionably the biggest musician in the nation, and, almost single-handedly, brought country music back into the main stream. It also bears mentioning that this was the era of Nine Inch Nails, Nirvana, all these really edgy musicians. Garth brooks had this really wholesome image, and I think, playing this character who has a way to escape from his own image without actually abandoning an insanely successful career entirely.
Honestly i love the idea of this project even if it was a flop
I mean all of these make perfect sense knowing that there was supposed to be a movie. For all we know, the documentary was what they managed to film for the movie
I feel so old hearing that people had no idea this happened. This was such big news back in the 90's.
Danny be honest is Robert real or a figment of your imagination
Real life Hannah Montana
THE WIG ISNT EVEN GOOD
Lost In You is a great song actually. And Garth doesn't have his music much online or on streaming.
I wasn’t even alive during Garth Brooks’ era but somehow I feel like this is common knowledge 😂
Chris Gaines: A Series of Unfortunate Events
ngl, at first I thought that was onision with a soul patch
Thanks Robert 🎉
I genuinely thought that was Onision in the thumbnail
Granny's got arthritis.
My mom loves Garth brooks lol
This is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen
We were robbed that we don't live in the timeline where Beyonce was the one who tried the alter-ego thing to swap genres instead of Garth Brooks. Imagine how extra she would have gone. No one would have figured it out.  Edit: If the band you're recommending "fox season" is the same one I found when I looked them up on youtube, pretty solid.
Who the hell is buying a new a Garth Brooks album? No way he sold 150 million albums.
he turned into onision wtf
Borat actually existed for some time before the feature-length movie. Sacha had a "variety show" on BBC called "Da Ali G Show" on which he played three different characters.  If your a Borat fan, it's well worth it to watch these too.  Borat's..."social commentary" and his "getting people to agree with racist statements" is even better on this show than the full-length movie; to the point it's shocking even to someone like me who lists Borat as a "all-time top 5 comedy movie".
Watching Danny slowly come to the same conclusion as Tom Segura about Garth Brooks is kinda like watching a marvel movie and knowing what happens but you want to see it unfold.
Where are the bodies, Garth?
Hey guys. Are we making fun of the hickey or what?
I remember this. What a weird stunt. 😂 Later when Chris Angel appeared I legit almost thought Garth was back at it again.
Thunder strikes song  was made from him because he cheated on his wife, what I was told.
is that onision
Has Danny heard of Spinal Tap? 😂
Dying laughing at this vid 😂
No one is saying "Bowie." He was trying to do a Bowie-esque character, which i don't think has been successfully accomplished by anyone but David Bowie
I believe that the single he released as Gaines didn’t originally state that it was by Garth Brooks. As I recall he spent a lot of time trying to make things look how he wanted them to look. Basically he was spending a ton of money removing as much of Gaines as was possible. And even refused to talk about it for some time. It was a very weird situation.
He’s going to force chris gaines into reality. Mark my words
9:36 Danny, I have news for you. Taylor has already done that, twice! You Belong With Me mv in 2008 and The Man mv in 2019
I “hate” country but I love mr garthy
How do we know Robert isn’t secretly Danny.
Am i having a stroke? I swear Danny did this video like 2 years ago?? Is this a reupload?
... how do i know who chris graines is just by the name and look alone but NOT the man behind him..?
When chris's music started i was expecting.... idk, by the aesthetic, i thought it would be some linkin park shit, mcr, even evanescence type of emo punk rock. Not sad souncloud indie boy. Honestly garth could have sold chris more if his style was less rawr xdd fangs and kisses and more sad white boy in a white tee w an acoustic guitar
love u dannyyyyyy
lol hannah montana did come out with an album called meet miley cyrus
I thought that was onision in the thumbnail...
You gen x audience being like, "yeah bro we already knew all this" 😂😂
Chris Gains looks like a mix of Anthony Kiedis and Keith Urban
Is no one gonna talk about the video being 17:38 minutes long 😫 IM LIKE HEY WASSUP HELLO
He was truly living his own Hannah Montana fantasy 🤣
Are u living under a rock this story was well known !
I 100% thought that alter ego picture was onision
Im getting a little Deja vu for some reason…
lol why did I think that was onision?
1738
Has anyone considered the unreleased movie might have been a comedy? Chris Gain's life is so outrageously tragic. It's like someone is taking the piss of the tortured artist trope
2:34 "barf brooks" 😭😭😭LMAO
I think... this was an attempted ARG made by Garth Brooks
It sounds like he was trying to do a Eminem/Marshall Mathers thing 😭
now look into Buster Poindexter and Sasha Fierce
Gotta love that Garth has a great sense of humor
Tbf, those shadows and effects and videography were just kinda how you did things in that genre of music in the 90s.
one time jk rowling (ew) put out books under an alternate namr to see if people would like her writting without her name attached. they didnt.
why he look like Snape
lol his Chris Gaines character didn't even play rock. It was like some weird easy listening.
saw the title and thought of fox szn
I hate how often they keep describing Gaines as rock’n’roll. That song was the furthest from rock n roll. He got the look but not the sound at all
Chris Gaines looks like onision
7:42 genuinely made me almost choke from laughing so hard
Robert looks like dave franco
i honestly love when artists create alter ego’s, barclay crenshaw compared to claude von straus is like apples nd oranges but its the same dude. create what u want to, as long as ur not tryna rebrand after being cancelled, do u mate
5:44 this is Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus erasure
Has anyone ever seen Chris Gaines and Onision in the same room together? 🤔
I think more artists should do this. I have always loved those music videos where the singer plays multiple characters, like in Avril Lavigne's "Girlfriend," or Taylor Swift's "You Belong With Me" (which are kind of the same song now that I think about it). It would be like that.   I would _love_ if Taylor Swift's altsona, Andromeda Twist, came out with her authentic 2007 pop-punk album, "Bleed With Me."   The cover title is a pop punk version of "You Belong With Me." "She wears short skirts, I wear converse. She's cheer captain and I'm not cheer captain."   She basically dresses and acts like Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way. I can't wait. Your move, Taylor.
The Fox  Chris Collab gonna go hard
Seeing country fans put the cd into their ford f-150 and be greeted by gentle emo songs is so funny to imagine
he's not the best selling solo artist in the US, Elvis is
he looks like onision?
I'm like hey what's up hello
I fully thought he was onision
Garth Brooks as Chris Gaines looks like Onision and I hate that
This is giving me war flashbacks of the buried secret of m night shyamalan 😂😂
Chris Gaines lore will never compare to Ethel Cain
As chris he looks so much like Onision.
Isn't that actually exactly what Taylor Swift is doing? She just calls it "eras" 🤨
Where are the bodies G?
Artist should just feel like they can be free to do what they want to do.
Was watching this when my mum came in and turns out she loved Chris Gaines and has the album and totally loves it lmao she didn't know about the movie but yeah he promoted it as himself aswell and Chris was ig an alter ego and not another persona??? Anyway yeah weird lmao
We love Robert
The name Garth comes from ancient Greece. Specifically, the section that sank into the ocean to become Atlantis. There, it was made popular by a purple-eyed sorcerer who became the apprentice to a king meant to bridge our worlds. So, other Garths kinda pale in comparison to that legacy
They play Chris Gaines up to be some super controversial rock star, and the two songs you played sound like elevator music. I get why people were confused, I would be too.
i have a theory… robert. is. danny.
my brother proposed  to his fiance at a garth brooks concert. im debating sending this to him
1:50 man dont tell jokes like that, im high and that shit scared me
Authors can have pennames and do multiple genres, singers should have that option too
Robert is the real one
"has he ever seen a rockstar before? he doesn't look like a rockstar he looks like a cult leader" Jared Leto: 👀👀
emo wedding photos sound pretty sick actually 🤫
Tell me more about Robert
Chris Gaines Threatens to Release New Music
Nobody does it like andy kaufman
chris gaines looks like onision 😟
Ugh I'm old. "Rock on Wayne." "Rock on Garth." Is Danny too young for Wayne's World? I'm gonna go lay down. Lol
Robin Sparkles to Robin Daggers
I lived this and it was freaking hilarious. 😂😂 c/o 1998
This ish was crazy back in the day i remember people literally refused to believe it
i think it’s funny that i have heard a chris gaines song but never heard a garth brooks one
I’m Robert’s biggest fan
Troy becker if he was peaked in the 1990s
I had the single of the song,I was in early junior high lol,I bought it at Best Buy. But you know who does an amazing cover of Lost in You....CHILDISH GAMBINO.
we know robert isnt real
I’m sorry I totally thought that “Chris gains” picture was onision 💀
🌟
I love when commentary channels cover mildly interesting news from 2000.
So that is the main cannel i don't know
The music of Chris Gaines does not match the emo vibes hahahah
@1:02 🫠
Robert does so much for us 😔🙏🫵
Shoutout to h3 at 5:08 ❤
wild that i scrolled for several minutes on a video about garth brooks and didnt see a single comment about the bodies? those families deserve closure
ahh the pete wentz haircut, he might as well have started playing bass too
As a full time wedding photographer, I’m gonna do this.
when you mentioned "was this as his career was starting to fade into irrelevance or is this at the height of his fame?" I laughed a little. just for background, he never really faded into irrelevance. he's STILL wildly successful. He regularly sells out stadiums and still makes new music. Friends in Low Places is in the top 5 on several country music charts, and is even #1 on a few.
my mom was 20 when this all happened so i just texted her "do you remember garth brooks doing Chris Gaines? if yes, what did you think was going on with him?" and her responses were "yes." and "having fun" but "dont know if i ever listened to any of the music" 😂 (which is fair tbh i was born a few months prior to the single release, woman was busy)
YOU LEAVE GARTH BROOKS ALONE GOD F*CKING D@MN IT!
This video was sponsored by Chris Gaines
Why does the picture of him in the thumbnail look just like onision bro I’m screaming
chris gaines is onision i fear
I love robert
This means you don’t watch ymh and that’s disappointing
it's just paul zimmer all over again
Garth Brooks is so weird to me as someone from the UK because everything you are saying suggests he is an insanelt popular superstar but i dont think most people outside of the US would have a clue who he is
i remember when i watched the video where danny disguised himself and was shocked how fast people caught on
The Chirs Gaines backstory is giving middle school girl's first OC
the beatles did this!....but then they just kept their name the same lol...they did change their look though...added mustaches
He looks like Onision on his alter ego LMAO
I do nens physique photo and do a lot of open shirt not shoes shots. I'm not well versed on cults or cult leaders as I don't plan on starting a cult now I feel bad lol
As an European Millennial, I've never heard of Garth Brooks in my entire life
danny we know it was you ur so silly tbh
if sacha baron cohen was just borat i might not question it
I THOUGHT it was onion boy and felt nauseous for a second . I was confused before I got confused
Crazy how Borat turned out to be super racist…
You have to remember when this happened, you couldn’t Google a picture of Chris Gains, you couldn’t go on YouTube and rewatch this performance. You only heard about it or happened to catch a glimpse on VH1. So we knew, but like you weren’t sure. lol   Edited to add: we also thought it was fucking stupid when we realized what was happening.
W Robert
It’s actually killing me that Chris Gaines just looks like On*sion. But he can actually sing. Like, go back and compare the two, they look like they could be brothers
Oli London
Only jachlatt really knows what has happened in 99
I can't believe Garth Brooks was Hannah Montana
thank u Robert ❤
Chris Gaines was later revived by McDonalds as Hot Hamburglar
Why have you called Drew “Robert”?
when the alter ego started singing on SNL, i literally made the exact same expression that danny then cuts to a second later and when i saw it, i started laughing so hard 😭
I'm not a big country fan but this doesn't strike me as any different than Ziggy Stardust or Sgt. Pepper, when these guys get so huge and have a decent size catalog, ideas like this come along, if it was more successful no-one would have noticed.
He is the original Hannah montana
Every time someone is both the host and musical guest on SNL I always want them to introduce themselves while sitting in the audience and then sprint on stage in a panic while their band starts playing
I purchased this album and still have it to this day, am still confused
Sturgill Simpson is the artist who best released country and rock at the same time in my book. Just put out what he wants but admittedly he's a more fringe artist so that probably helps
I never got the chance to like Garth brooks growing up because my dad taught me about Chris Gaines at like age 7😭😭😭
Professor Snape turned music star
Im not that much older than Danny, bit this video makes me feel old just because I know stuff about Garth Brooks
Chris Gaines failed as a rock artist, but at the encouragement of his late father, Gaines became Garth Brooks, the country singer. As Garth Brooks, his career skyrocketed, but Chris's passion as a rockster still burns inside, believing that he can make it work as his true self and not having to hide behind the Garth Brooks facade anymore. However, the country star power was proven unstoppable. Chris maintained the monster he created, but deep down, he will always be Chris Gaines.
he definitely just went insane and wanted a rebrand but it didnt work out. the whole movie character thing sounds like a shitty cover up story
"Garth Brooks IN Chris Gaines" 😂😂
This reminds me of something Tim Robinson would do
Where's the bodies Garth?
Garth wanted to be Tony Wonder
13:18 I feel like I'm being gaslit rn
I also think it's funny because like...he's a VERY famous artist. He's known for his VOICE. Changing his face isn't the main issue here.
Robert is added to the list of characters in the Danny lore
I was in junior high, and a fan of Garth Brooks when he became this alter ego. But, I don't remember there ever being a movie about this character he played. It was always portrayed as something real. I think this is when Garth Brooks probably went insane. And, maybe Chris Gaines invented and inspired emo music in the early 2000s. The world may never know.
Garth Brookes is one giant Australian con. The country music version of Drop Bears.
Danny, that's two different people. That's Garth Brooks and Chris Gaines. RIP Chris Gaines.
I actually never knew it was the same person cause I never like listened to him much or anything lol
i have never heard of Brooks. how????
Brooks is a big LBGT ally, just a fun fact. Also, I want a Chris Gaines comeback
This is who the House of Night kids were talking about when they said Garth Brooks was the “biggest vamp of them all!”
I only knew garth brooks as half of brooks & dunn. I had no idea that garth brooks had such an insane tangential lore. How did i not know? I now need to know everything abt him. This level of insanity is kinda fun
You dont know anyone else with the name Garth? Well i guess Wayne doesnt have anyone to party on with.
Wait…. This is kinda camp…
Timing is insane, I was JUST talking about the whole Chris Gaines thing with my brother over the weekend, so I already knew about it. I feel like he even appeared on SNL as Chris Gaines... which maybe you talk about, but I haven't actually finished the video yet. So yeah tbf, I have never actually done any investigating about Chris Gaines. I just remember being a kid and seeing it and thinking it looked like a stupid thing to do, so this video is actually just what I needed to get caught up on the backstory of Chris Gaines.
Danny is so enclosed quadrangle or yard especially one surrounded by a cloister core 😍😍💅
i don’t like how danny was watching me because i had a whole conversation with someone for the first time about garth brooks the day before this video was posted
i bet you're chris gaines
literally the weirdest thing garth could do
i want more robert lore
People straight up changing their avatars/ skins. Last couple years are crazy.
My favorite fact about garth brooks is his recipe for the breakfast bowl he eats every day which consists of 2 tablespoons butter, 8 large eggs, one 16-ounce bag frozen hash browns, such as Tater Tots, thawed, 1 pound pork sausage, 1 pound bacon, *One 9-ounce package cheese and roasted garlic tortellini*, and 10 ounces sharp Cheddar, grated.
More like Barf Grooks! More like Barf Crooks!
This is one of my biggest music hyperfixations, I have four copies of his album, one is holographic. I also have some weird Garth brooks merch in general (promotional not for sale stuff and pins) and the things I find most interesting about this whole thing is the insane fake lore about the fake band that he fake left and how he shot the pictures to make him look skinny and it didn’t bode well for his live concerts when he was gaining weight
The side tangent about the name Garth had me rolling lol
Garth Brooks just chose to be Keith Urban
I honestly though for most of this video that this was all fake and just one of Danny’s pranks, because it all seems so fake 😭😭
silly danny has never heard of the absolute banger no skips album "hannah montana 2: meet miley cyrus" from like 2008
Where are the bodies Garth!?
Garth is from my hometown. Our Target, and most of the town, is on Garth Brooks Boulevard
bruh became adam lambert 😔😔
As an old…he really was hiding who he was. The single came out and Garths name or a project was never mentioned. Someone outed him, and people were laughing about it, and that’s when PR stepped in and the albums label was changed to put Garths name on the cover. He wanted us to believe Chris was real, the album was supposed to be ground breaking, and then he’d surprise us all that Chris was Garth all along. But it didn’t happen that way.  I wasn’t a country music fan, but he was say about 1/2 Taylor Swift popularity. In fact he’d be second I think in popularity as of now. But I understand he was put in a box and wanted to try something super different but fans would of just left if he said “I wanna go Emo”. But I think the overdone character just made people say wtf no matter what music we all liked. But his career still recovered and then he retired pretty early still hugely popular.
Anybody else think Chris Gaines looks like Onision a little bit
Garth Brooks’ legal first name is Troyal
A-ba-bye🧍‍♂️
lemony snicket's hit series about a tortured musical artist, "a series of bad things happening"
Where’s the bodies G
Look up granger smith and earl dibbles jr. lol
Where are the bodies, G?
I had this single, back when I was in high school in the 90s, they had a big display for it at the front of Sam Goody (damn, I'm really that old).  I remember sitting with a friend in her car as this song played on the radio and she was pissed that Chris Gaines wasn't going on tour because she wanted to see him in concert.  I had to explain to her that this was just Garth Brooks having a mid-life crisis.  Thanks for opening up this memory, I had a great laugh!
Ohh..to be young enough not to remember this happening 😂
I remember when this was all taking place when I was a teenager, I never did listen to his music as Chris Gaines and I'm kind of glad I didn't! The few clips that you showed so far I was not enjoying at all. I like him much better as Garth brooks, and I'm not a country fan either.
I lived through this as it happened and it was just as  bizarre as you imagine
Honestly looking like onion 🌰 is punishment enough. Poor garth
the Troy Becker of the music world
Wait until Danny finds out about The Rutles
Meh. I know several artists who put out alter ego's and people play along with it because it's a bit fun, and the artist gets to work with a different sound and aesthetic.
why does he look like onision lmao
I actually forgot this happened. You unlocked some memories.
I keep hearing Chris James lol
PLEASE release a full tutorial?!?!?!
We need more Robert lore
Also old, also remember this. We all knew it was Garth. He wanted to try something different. I remember people trying to compare it to prince changing his name to a symbol, but that wasn't it. He just wanted to try something new. We were all in on the joke.
so proud of Fox Szn for inspiring Chris gaines
Damn Danny, 1 mil in a day? The man can't be stopped.
Love silly goofy videos like this, but I also love the long deep dives! Just keep being you!
This was his beyonce Sasha fierce moment
I would love more Fox Szn 😅 Circus went off!
i don’t get why he got so much backlash. it’s just a fun side project. it’s clear who he was, he just was creating this fictional universe to go with his fictional character. he was a silly goose in a pond of serious ducks 😔
big ups robert 🙏🙏🙏
I was a teen when the Gaines thingy happened. I avoided this mess of a story, all my life. I’m surrendering today.
Where's the bodies Garth?
OMG Danny this is killing me, i'm old enough to remember this and we were all aware of it lol I can't remember anyone at the time thinking it was anyone but GB doing a bit. We didn't have content creators at the time, remember! It was a goofy sort of act for some fun promotion and it wasn't that shocking, LOL. I'm just smiling at the idea that anyone thought he was trying to do this seriously -- it's a little Ziggy Stardust of him ;)
It's like he saw Elliott Smith and was like, "I'm gonna do that but bad"
This was the last time I listened to Garth Brooks music... Because of this! It was so dumb and weird!
Garth is the most amazing performer I've ever seen. I remember when this went down. My friends and I just rolled our eyes and laughed. He fooled no one.  The Trisha Yearwood scandal! They toured together, he eventually left his wife and got married to Trisha, another huge country singer at the time.
So my mom is a die hard Trisha Yearwood fan and I happen to know about their history because of that lol. Trisha Yearwood started in the big music industry as a backup singer for Garth Brooks and that’s when they started hitting it off. Garth helped to launch her career as a solo artist and then the two became married. She must’ve helped him with this alter ego because they were just tight like that and had a pretty immediate connection. They’re still together now and tbh I love the two of them, usually don’t gaf about celebrity relationships but you can tell theirs is pure love and they are constantly uplifting each other.
I honestly thought he was going for an Andy Kaufman/Tony Clifton thing.
9:39  I feel like Taylor Swift would do something like this tbh
DANNYYYYY DANNY BOYYYY IM COMING FOR YOU DANNYYY
WE LOVE GARTH BROOKS
The country chart is a different chart
I remember this fiasco, I was 14 years old in 1999. Gosh dangit Gonzalez making me feel old as fuck out here.
I listen to Fox Szn on the daily ♥
The alter ego looks like Criss Angel
The country charts are separate than the hot 100. Why he didn’t have any other songs on there
comment 68 of watching every single video on Danny's second channel for no particular reason at all
when i saw him in concert i just kept thinking about how chris gaines could you pop out at any point
It's important to note that this was before social media, really. So the average fan just saw Chris Gaines appear out of no where
7:46 this, yes, 10000%
oh! drew posted!!
so many artists are forced to chose a single genre/sound and portray a specific image and are penalised for not doing so (labi siffre is a talented example) so i half understand it
Danny look up the Central Park NYC concert, that should give you an idea of Garth Brooks as his peak, there's recordings on youtube!
I was 27 when this happened, I was never a Garth Brooks fan but everybody knew who he was. I never heard anything about a movie, and remember him being completely serious about this alter ego. Only after it started getting out that CG was GB did any "cheeky-ness" start.
I'm glad Danny has other people he can relate to. Drew can only do so much for him 🥲
What did he hope to Gaine from this?
i wouldnt be surprised if the albums came out and there was a "collab" with fox szn. like... i think danny and him would do it imo
Amazing video as always Danny. Encore!
15:32 I love you chris I’m your biggets fuann
Honestly, Chris Gaines would be the perfect hideout after a murder. Maybe Garth started building up a whole fake famous person so that one day he could kill his wife and disappear without a trace, turning permanently into Chris Gaines... It's like maintaining a false identity just in case you're up to no good... What is behind Garth?
I remember being like 8-10 when this happened and everyone really was freaking out lol Garth used to be everywhere and he got trashed so hard for the Chris Gaines thing at first.
I thought this was gonna be about drake bell tbh
Thanks Robert
Where are the bodies Garth? The families need closure.
6:36 “It’s Garth Brooks IN Chris Gaines”
2 videos in a row and Danny has mentioned the one man team consisting of Robert both times, scared..
Being Chris Gaines is when you dress like Nine Inch Nails but your music sounds like Hall & Oates.
Prediction: He was Paul Zimmer
Where are the bodies Chris
That's why you don't FOLLOW like dumb one track minded sheeps
How could YOU not have heard of Garth Brooks?!?!?
robert be putting in the work for the second channel
It is so funny that this is number 14 on trending rn because this is not only Danny’s second channel but all the other (with maybe one or 2 exceptions) ones on trending are high budget😭
Soooo... then basically you were the only one who made a fool of himself trying to pretend to be someone else and got caught because the Gaines thing was actually intentional...🤔 😂😂😂 ❤❤❤
i often forget that we're the same age
Ayyyy, Haven’t Wathed The Video Yet, Garth Brooks!!!
genuinely feels like this could have been the precursor to “popstar: never stop never stopping”
Yikes
by doing some math I finally figured out how old he is Danny is 34 or 35 don't ask how
Where are the bodies, Garth? This is not cool, slick, or neat stuff.
You’re one to talk danny
I'm gen X and I remember this vividly and when we found out Mr. Brooks became our national treasure.
plot twist he wasn't writing a movie, he was trying to convince broadway that he could play Jekyll & Hyde instead of David Hasselhoff
I bought an official Garth brooks tshirt from a Scottish charity shop for 43p three years ago. Unfortunately it ripped in half suddenly about a week ago
The OG Hannah Montana
I love that this is being rediscovered for youtube lol I was like 12 when Garth released Chris Gaines
Green day kinda did this as the network 😁
WHO IS ROBERT
why does he keep on metioning his editor robert ? in every video
I love you Garth Brooks 😘
why do i feel like robert isnt real
too cheeky for his own good☹️
The 2nd Hannah Montana album actually included a CD called Meet Miley Cyrus which was music she released as herself.. so yeah 😂
Danny needs to read into the rumor of Garth Brooks being a serial killer lol
DANNY AND COUNTRY MUSIC COLLAB - MY TWO WORLDS COLLIDING
honestly, i wish artists did something like this more. i'm a huge fan of when artists are constantly moving and reinventing themselves (regardless of what their fans will think i.e. bowie, and the band sparks) either way, but i think this seems like a fun way to do that for artists who don't fancy taking such a big risk but still wanna try something new. maybe not to this extent, but the basic concept is so interesting to me.
Are you sure this isn't just Garth Brook's D&D character? The tragic backstory is certainly there.
I remember when ur video came out about fox szn I immediately thought to myself “this reminds me of Garth Brooks”
Did anyone else feel like that article was written by Chat GPT? Definitely sounded like AI writing lol
Danny gomaz smile
Is Chris Gaines literally a Nashville plotline?
Stephen King did this too
HELP why does his alter ego look like Onision with a soul patch😭
the fact that hannah montana did in fact release an album called "hannah montana 2: meet miley cyrus" lmaooo
ودهامیهام چون چهنمهبلهاهم دهلم تگ شده هم چند بگرم سهت پچه میهام بله
Stephen King did something similar in the ‘80s under the pen name “Richard Bachman”
garth brooks had a concert at my college's stadium and it caused a small earthquake
Came here thinking it was Onision, because he also failed at music
Wait until he learns about Derek And The Dominoes
just contact Tom Segura, he will tell you the truth about Garth. Touch my camera through the fence✌️
Goth Brooks.
the chris gaines albums are like his avatar films
I'm old enough to remember this happening and it was just as weird then. People didn't know if he thought we didn't know it was him immediately (we did) or if it was a bit or if he had lost his mind.
This reminds me of the first time I heard about The Network, who _definitely aren't_ the members of Green Day wearing balaclavas. But funnier because it seems such an earnest attempt.
I stopped your video halfway thru and listened to the song, because (Boomer alert) I remember loving the song back in the late 90s. And I thought your take on the whole Chris Gaines thing was a bit harsh. Then I tuned back in and found out about the whole film project and backstory and yeah, now I get it. It was kinda weird. Still love the song, though. Fun video.
I like when you shout out the content creator cus it's my name too
Old ol’ dnews
Shout out to Robert
Danny what have you done?? Now i have been listening to Chris Gaines all day !!!!!
when the chris gaines thing happened all the media covering it were all saying it was garth brooks' alter ego. he did some interviews and performances in character and people went along with the fiction just to  get into the spirit of the thing but everyone involved in the production and the audience were completely aware it was garth brooks.
Hannah Montana 2 album had a Meet Miley Cyrus cd 😂😂😂 SO yeah
shoutout to robert fr tho
my boyfriend’s name is Chris Gaines and this is SO weird to me
I honestly don't see what's weird about.  Musicians have alter egos that they develop a character for. There are tons in rap and metal that never drop their act. Bro is essentially sitting here confused by the gorillaz for 20 minutes
garth brooks is crazyyyyy about copyright dear god be careful😩😭
It’s so weird to see this having been in the music video industry in Nashville at the time. Yeah the movie was just an idea, but everyone knew it was Garth doing a bit.
Lmao .. this is ancient news .
3:44 side note as well, every time you mention it it makes me think of that Vegan Gainz youtuber 🤣😂😅
What does the fox szn say though?
Maybe I'm totally off, but I feel like he wasn't trying to hide the fact that Chris Gaines was fictional at all. It was a character project and they seem to have given him a backstory like Iggy Stardust or Gorillaz, but I feel like it was all just an art piece in the end. To me, it never felt like he was trying to hide the fact that it was him all along. He wasn't shouting it from the roof tops, but if anyone was curious, he made all of the information readily available.
Can your hickey on your neck get any bigger?!?!
i swear to god all these articles sound so ai generated
Billboard Hot 100 and the Country Music charts are different, somehow. Usually. :)
Fact check: Garth Brooks is *not* the number 1 solo selling artist in US history. That title belongs to Elvis Presley. Second place belongs to Micheal Jackson.
LMAO 6:20 I was a kid back then and I actually did buy this song and sang it a lot hahahahaha
my dad loves garth brooks and does not like chris gaines at all
David Bowie was the best at that. Emo boi? Naw, he became a pansexual space rocker with a band of spiders from mars.
I love Chris Gaines! My mom and I listened to that cd all the time, and we still do! The way of the girl, Digging for Gold, and That's the way I remember it, are my favorites!!!!
If Garth Brooks released a new album today, I am pretty sure it would also sell like crazy. I don't think his stardom is something of the past. He's just factually one of the most famous musicians in history.
My older brother is literally named after Garth Brooks (which made Danny's bit about not knowing it was a name super funny to me) and my parents never mentioned that a couple years after they named their child after this man everyone thought he lost his marbles
Apologies to that Garth guy, but from the thumbnail of your video, I thought he was pretending to be Onision because of how much he looks like him in the picture, I was so confused
Isn't this just one big One Piece reference
Thx for releasing this video Danny!
Chris Gaines looks like Zach Varmitech from the Kratt Brothers show
the Chris Gaines picture Danny uses honestly looks like onision with a soul patch
8:08 Country music did not rate on the Hot 100 or top 40 charts at the time. They had their own separate metrics.
I heard he eats the skin of his victims. Only the skin.
Cosplaying his emo oc
I swear I get whiplash everytime Danny ends a video 😂 Just ' Bye 👋 ' and then blank ahaha 😆 Man's got places to be!
8:14
8:20 Country songs rarely go on the Billboard Top 100. Pretty sure he makes a LOT more money as Garth Brooks.
We all knew it was Garth Brooks at the time.
Still tryna figure out where the bodies are 🤷
Drew Gooden in:  the Life of Danny Gonzales.
FOX SZN<333
Growing up in the South I can confirm, if you have no clue who Garth Brooks is and you didn't spot Chris Gaines being him you're gonna get made fun of during recess.
Isn’t this basically the same thing as Beyoncé / Sasha Fierse?
How did i give you a like and a dislike?
Maybe consider installing an ad blocker, less to blur out and a cleaner screen
Worst part is that the little bit of the song we heard in this video is like, the mildest shit ever. It's not at all what you would expect from such a supposed emo rockstar with a tragic backstory.
You were confused about Garth Brooks being number one but never on top of the charts. That's because he is the number one SELLING SOLO artist. So if you list all of the musicians by sales and then remove all of the bands and groups from the list, he is number one.
everyone say thank you Robert
Applaus for Robert
When I was very young I asked for a Garth brooks cd for Christmas and got the Chris Gaines one. I was SO confused because who tf was Chris Gaines and why did they get me this for Christmas. So it did fool at least one slightly sad 6 year old.
كتير حلو ❤
I dont know whats worse. You covering this now, the fact that my parents have Chris Gains’s CD, or that i 100% knew about this by the time i was about 10….all of these are arguably crazy sentences to say.
"...and even a sOuL pAtCh" 😵
It’s because of the bodies.
The most impressive thing is that the person finding this elite content is a different guy everytime
that article you read is insane it really seems like it was written by ai or something
He just wanted to be a Hannah Montana, a lot of country people want to have alter egos
ive never heard of garth brooks in my entire life is this an alternate reality thing
The families need closure, Garth.
I think its interesting that Chris Gaines looks like that.  I totally forgot that 90s pick-up artists were the height of fashion for early aughts rock stars.  Then emo kids kinda stole the look a few years later.
garth is short for garthield
"Party on, Wayne!" "Party on, Garth!"
I loved his song as Chris Gaines and had the album years ago. I was looking forward to the movie. Shame we never got it
Literally never heard this guy's name before. Both names I guess.
Fell asleep listening to Garth Brooks and woke up to this lol. Gonna fall asleep listening to Norwegian folk metal next and see if Danny talks about it.
Chris Gaines was just Onision 🤷🏽‍♀️
bro had a tragic oc before that was even a thing
Now I'm sure, Robert is not a real person.
been loving this kind of content where we explore a topic along with you, very immersive (shoutout to robert)
14:04 Danny accidentally suggests Garth had sex with himself.
6:10 "he's not a rock star, he looks more like a cult leader" Jared Leto: "what's the difference??"
Dude you missed a huge mark on your Garth Brooks/Chris Gaines. He was trying to keep up with Keith Urban. Who was an Australian country singer that was experimenting with other genre sounds like the “emo” stuff you are talking about.
algorithm comment <3
Ok so I was like 12 when this happened and I listened to a lot of smooth jazz and adult contemporary music (I've been old since birth). I unironically LOVED "Lost in You" as a song lol
Get Austin Butler to play every character in the Garth Brooks/Chris Gaines biopic.
The Taylor swift comparison one is actually kinda a real thing 😭😭😭 basically the other girl in the you belong with me music video
I think the funniest part of fox_szn is the fact that the biggest give away is your posture, to me at least. You just stand in a very distinctive way 😅😂 I could spot you in a crowd of a thousand people from a mile away just based on posture.
Chris Gaines looks like Zoolander Ben Stiller
I remember this era and it was HILARIOUS. A train wreck.
Childish Gambino did a live cover of "Lost in You", if anyone is interested. But yeah, this was pretty crazy when it happened.
He's also one of the most litigious people in history. You'll likely get strikes from this video and sued by Barth himself. Maybe you discuss this but I'm only halfway through.
The video is 17:38. I thought I would point that out lol
"Definitely seems like a weird thing to do" - guy who did exactly the same thing
Where's the bodies, G??
hey i recognise robert
I had no idea there was a movie lol It was just bizarre when it was happening in real time.
I thought the alter ego in the thumbnail was shane dawson
One of the best: https://youtu.be/c9UY7J_UZT0?si=aA8Y2uPTpmcC0Ltq👈💯💯
Am I trippin or did Danny’s voice get deeper since he had his baby
He kinda looks like the onion boy
He sort of looks like onision lmao
Omggg it’s L from death note
Why is your hair turning gray?
It actually makes perfect sense for a superstar to want to experience just being a musician again, without influencing or being influenced by their main brand.   Many famous artists have done some variation of this, though maybe not quite as comedically.
Wait until Danny finds out about Hannah Montana
I’m pretty sure Stephen King did kinda the the same thing once. He wanted to step back from horror but he was so cemented in the genre he had to make a fake person too.
Reminds me of when Joaquin Phoenix made a fake documentary pretending to have a breakdown
he kinda looks like he got kicked outta nickleback ngl
We <3 Robert
I wish he had introduced Chris on SNL and then just ran full speed to the stage in front of the camera
I did not have this on my bingo card
FUCK YEAH!! ROBERT!!!
I remember when this happened (I was in my 20s), and I remember thinking it was weird... I was worried Garth had lost it. Lol
From the thumbnail I thought you were talking about Damon Albarn for a second
WHERE ARE THE BODIES GARTH?!
Is this a reupload or am I having major deja vu?
no one who has been a teen within the past several decades is surprised that garth brooks came up with an edgy emo OC with an unnecessarily elaborate backstory, bless his heart
i thought you were gonna say hannah montana
My dads name is gary but everyone calls him “garth of the yard” ☠️ I think its a name
A 10 year old kid doesnt know wtf he’s talking about
AHH i forgot this happened!!
Omg no way he said. I like that
Damn, didn‘t know fight club had a sequel
Its giving Joaquin Phoenix
So I've done a lot of research into the Chris Gaines phenomenon and... I just want to clear up a few confusing tidbits. First off, the album was originally released as "Chris Gaines Greatest Hits". His backstory includes being in the band "Crush" (he and his bandmate wanted to be the new Lennon and McCartney) and then going on to do some solo projects. Another important tidbit is that while he was doing this stunt in 1999, Garth Brooks and his then wife were separated, with his divorce happening a few years later in 2001. With that context in mind, his VH1 Behind the Life documentary is a WILD ride. The amount of time spent discussing his sex addiction is insane and plays out like what a middle schooler thinks sex addiction would be. Pair that with the fact that he was separating from his wife and it looks like he's severely overcompensating with a character that HE CREATED by making Chris Gaines a rocker sex god. For more context, I made a helpful video analysis: https://youtu.be/rC-VjV8cDDw
“this is barf brooks”
this so funny, I remember this happening and we all though it was funny as hell, weird but we understood - nu metal was killing country and if you can't beat them, join them.
gregs, is it just me or am I lowkey getting suspicious of Robert (danny's team of content curators), idk danny shouting him out so often makes him sus. feels like danny's up to no good...
I remember this happening. I feel like everyone knew right away.
9:35 but Taylor did once pretend to be another person (a man to be specific) in ‘the man’ music video and I genuinely did not think it was her until someone told me
5:57  😭😭
I always wondered about this because I was young when this happened and didn’t fully grasp the concept. Then saw the VH1 episode as a kid and thought Chris Gaines was actually a real person that just favored Garth Brooks 😂 Thanks for doing the research and letting us know!
a few months ago I was at a writing camp where we learned about Chris Gaines and then did an activity where we took genres we didn’t write about and made up a persona who did write those book genres. The counselor said we were “Chris Gaines-ing ourselves”
As a designated Old Person, I can confirm that back in the day when the internet wasn't as omnipresent the whole "Chris Gaines" thing did confuse and fool some people, but generally people knew it was some kind of Garth Brooks alter-ego thing for a movie once it got into the major news outlets and the newscasters were very wink-wink about it. "We're going to interview Chris Gaines, who we hear is a big fan of Garth Brooks!" I think he may have tried to see if he could legitimately trick people at first, but most people figured it out fairly quick by 1999 standards and his fans were like, "...the hell is this?" When they listened to the album. It was definitely pretty widely known by the time he was on SNL.
Isn’t this what Ethel Cain is doing? Love her
Chris Gains kinda gives me a Chris Angel vibe
Where are the bodies G?
I knew immediately who you were talking about it, my dad use to talk about it!
16:40 I mean... he isn't wrong. The song has 5.3k likes on this channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCPYt6BYOSI) and probably more on a few others. It's a very Niche group, but it's still a group.
Where are the bodies Garth?
2:57 I’m sorry but there should not be a full stop before the or, nor should there be a comma afterwards
So he's Hannah Montana if Miley was already a massive celebrity...
as someone with OCs its genuinely so real of him to just make every possible traumatic event to happen to chris gaines
I’m ctfu I looked up Chris Gaines pictures and he 100% looks like Ben stiller in Zoolander
I THOUGHT THAT WAS ONISION FOR A SEC
he’s so me when i create an entire fake life and world views for my silly little characters
A Garth is an enclosed quadrangle or yard, especially one surrounded by a cloister
Chris Gains X Fox Szn  LETS GOO
did you not say "darth brooks"? Missed opportunity
im being so serious rn i thought that was onision in the thumbnail
Uhhh, he didn't "fail".  He made millions, still makes millions and you're talking about someone who hasn't been popular in 10 years in 2024.  I think the guy who failed is you Bro LOL.
Gotta admire the whole anime backstory of Chris.
I halfway remember this.  It was meant to be funny if i remember. He was super popular at that time
Too little too late “Danny”
Robert is HOT!! 🔥🔥
i went through the entire video thinking it said "magician" and not "musician" and i was waiting for the magic the entire time
Gives me Joaquin Phoenix vibes, except his movie actually came out
Garth Brooks Onision cosplay (gone wrong)
Knowing youre 34 makes me uncomfortable 😅 I thought you were in your 20s
For some reason, I always thought Garth was a type of fish and that’s where he get his name from, but now that I actually think about it for more than 2 seconds, I think I’m getting it confused with “Gar”, which is a type of fish
Average twitter OC lol
"black and white with one pop of color... Maybe red." Ah, yes, the Schindler's List Wedding Photo Package™©® 😂
lol three thumbnail and only hero text changed XD
This totally resurrects the theory that Danny and Drew are in fact the same person.
Honestly from the listens that you gave us from Chris Gaines I think I'll un-ironically listen to him
Why did I assume the sleeping with the manager plot would be with a man and not a woman?
Tbf, in Taylor's you belong with me video, she plays a character that is literally just her in a brunette wig and some people still don't realise it's her😭 Also "The Man" video feela relevant in this context
Chris angel, country singer
gregory.
As a now-oldie i remember this very well. Garth Brooks came out the gate with a debut album that had now-classic hits on it, and followed that up with numerous albums with numerous hits. It got to the point that he could sing names out of the phone book and it would have gone platinum. I believe he got bored.  I remember being kind of embarrassed for him cause what the hello? What with the bad wig and soul-patch? You've got a ton of money and this is the best you could do? The music wasn't bad, but it sounded like Garth Brooks, so why not just be Garth Brooks?   One thing that Garth Brooks was was an entertainer. It's a shame he didn't allow his music to be on You Tube or streaming for years; long enough to be forgotten by a generation. If anybody gets a chance to see some of his concert footage from back in the day, you will be shocked at the amount of energy he put into his shows. It's amazing.  One of his songs, "The Dance" has one of the best videos i have ever seen. "Friends in Low Places" is the best partying song ever, personally I love "What She's Doing Now" and "Learning to Live Again".  I think his music is slowly being allowed on YouTube, its a shame it took so long that he is largely forgotten and his name means little when he could still be relevant.
"it'd be like hannah montana releasing an album called 'im miley cyrus'"  bros never heard of hannah montana 2: meet miley cyrus
you have no idea how weird and wild it was to be aware of this in 1999. i was in middle school in the mountains at the time, just a mess 😂
As a designated Old Person, I can confirm that back in the day when the internet wasn't as omnipresent the whole "Chris Gaines" thing did confuse and fool some people, but generally people knew it was some kind of Garth Brooks alter-ego thing for a movie once it got into the major news outlets and the newscasters were very wink-wink about it.

Gaines backstory sounds like a middle schoolers OC's backstory
this man turned to onision
"Darth Brooks" would've been perfect
9:13 i know of one russian rock artist where her face was actually obscured with scribbles and blurs in the first music video she had, it was done to drive up hype around her so that people were guessing about who could she be. she was quite a breakthrough artist, adopting a much less formal language when it comes to texts compared to other rock songs
Just like Troy Becker
I miss watching Chip and Joanna Gaines, the house renovators! Tbh my grandma and I used to find those shows so cool
thank you robert ☺
In Denmark there was a guy who did it the opposite way by starting out with a fake identity and songs that were really trashy with a bragging attitude about money, women and so on, but became hugely popular when people started suspecting it was an act (it became more and more extreme) and then a year later or so it was revealed that he was indeed a character and I as far as I remember he made the songs 'bad' on purpose to show how easy it is to write a shitty pop song and have it pop off. Two years later he stopped using the character and began making music in his own name.
It sounds like he was trying to do a Spinal Tap, have you never heard of Spinal Tap Danny?
Another reminder that Garth Brooks is such a weird dude.    Where are the bodies Garth?
Ill be 39 next month, and i remember this, it was so weird and awkward. I was so confused by it lol also i love that their are other people my age who loves to watch danny too
It seems to me that he just really wanted to try different genres and didn’t know how to accomplish that as Garth Brooks because ppl expected a certain sound from him. It’s sad 🙁 I’d say it’s one thing I really enjoyed finding out about BTS, they kinda just try whatever genre they want and the fandom is always supportive, it’s super nice to see!  It seems like Garth Brooks might have thought this was the only way to have ppl accept him stepping outside of the box they put him in and it backfired 🫣
It was at the height of his fame yes.
kinda looks like Trent Reznor lol
the funniest thing about Danny imagining Taylor Swift pretending to be another person is that she actually did that twice lol
Idk if anyone’s mentioned this yet but musicians often have alter egos now. Like Beyoncé has Sasha fierce and Gaga had Jo Calderon… and even before then it was David Bowee and Ziggy Stardust… I guess the difference was Garth Brooke’s just wanted it to be a secret… like Hannah Montana 😂😂😂😂
Honestly I feel like there’s so many artists that would like to change their style, but they can’t because that’s not what people would expect from them.
Danny has gaslit us so much that he says Robert found the videos and I immediately think that Robert isn't real and this character will be a part of another video.
WHO IS ROBERT DANNY I NEED TO KNOW
Garth Brooks became Chris Gaines after doing too much Co Caine!!
Chris Gaines looking like when you order Liam Gallagher off Wish...
Mostly I just learned that the music journalism pretty much sucks now. The articles were so horribly written...
this is some Hannah Montana shit
It was SO confusing, and, yes, we thought he'd lost his mind. Never heard a word of a movie! He just went wonky.
He did it to promote a movie and music tour.
Personally, as a huge Garth Brooks fan at the time, I thought it was cool and a very interesting idea.  I was interested in seeing the movie, but the public didn't like the "bit" so no movie came out. As a fan, reading all the stuff I could, there was no "trick." He wasn't trying to fool people. He was so stuck in country and there were very strict lines in music. People didn't just change genres. It was a way to do some different music without it being tied to the Garth Brooks IP. It wasn't as crazy as people are making it out to be. I was around 25 at the time. I thought it was cool that they tried to do this whole backstory and everything. I understood what he was doing. I guess no one else did.
This can actually be done successfully, look at the Japanese pop star Tommy February6 and her rock alter ego, Tommy Heavenly6, as well as her work as the singer for the band The Brilliant Green under the name Tomoko Kawase. Different genres, similar but slightly different names, all 3 are successful
Isn't garth brooks the one that people think us a murderer??
I don't believe Robert is real
Hi
❤
I hope machine gun kelly never hears of this. That would totally give him ideas.
why does his alter ego look like onision
what garth loses, chris gaines.....
‏‪14:23‬‏ so is that one of the friends.. in low places?
I just want to know why he went "this is meant to be rock so I'll let someone else write it for me" and then got other country artists to write it.
cant wait till Tom from YMH talks about this XD
How do we know this wasn't just you again 🤨
proud of the hickey, danny
‏‪9:28‬‏ as a swifty, that really sounds like something she would do😂 maybe as a tease for reputation tv
the man became his OC
I think some artists just like to pretend to be another fictional artist to create different styles of work. I think they just want to expirement without catching flak. This artist isn't the only one to do this, this actually happens quite alot
His voice though is top tier
I think I was in juniorhigh or highschool at the time and I remember he was genuinely trying to trick the public and all the media at the time was saying he had a nervous break. I'll never forget that soul patch though. It was the weirdest things like he was trying to as cool as a boy in a boy band but one of the ones that just kinda hang around in the back 😅
Where are the bodies, Garth?
woaw
It’s giving Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne
danny please do another ghost hunting video
5:44  ok but there was literally a Hannah Montana album that shipped with an EP called "Meet Miley Cyrus" 😭😭
As someone who was a kid then, it was definitely presented as Brooks was changing his name to Chris Gaines like Prince became The Artist Formerly Known as Prince a few years earlier. There was never anything remotely close to a movie ever mentioned, and he was completely sincere and doing everything as Chris Gaines. There was no "tricking" anyone, it was immediately known to be Garth Brooks.  It was so damn weird.
Nah man, the video is like that because he's cosplaying as Trent Reznor.  In all seriousness I was alive for this and at no point was he attempting to trick people, everybody knew it was him, seemed like more of a Joaquin  Phoenix type of thing.
I had this childhood classmate with the last name ‘Monks’ and one time my mom forgot his dad’s name but wanted to greet him, so she asked my dad what it was. He said it was Chip. Like Chip-Monks lmao. It’s not Chip. But you reminding me of Chip Gaines has made me realize that there could truly be a Chip Monks out there. Incredible.
I feel like calling Garth Brooks world famous only makes sense if you ignore the existence of any country other than the US lol.   Also, Gaines' backstory sounds like something a moody teenager wrote. What a weird idea.
Fake news.  Garth Brooks was the 2nd highest selling artist of all time.
Why does he look like onision😭
was convinced that first pic of chris gaines was onision for a moment
Chris Gaines seems like a character from Greg’s anatomy ngl
Fox Szn and Chris Gaines collab when?😭🛐💀
You don't do your own research?
Thank you for bringing light to such a serious issue. When you're talking about G, I say let the conversation begin and hopefully we'll find out where the bodies are hidden so the families can get closure.
Imagine making yourself an entire separate life for an alter ego, and that life is Chris Angel.
All my fellow oldsters saying “There was never a movie planned! He’s re-writing history!” I see you were not a film-obsessed teenager with a subscription to Entertainment Weekly. I was reading line items about “Garth Brooks’ vanity film project ‘The Lamb’” and how he was planning to play live as the main character, Chris Gaines, for at least a year before he put out the first single. On the other hand, the fact that Brooks pulled such a huge publicity stunt and absolutely nobody remembers there was supposed to be a movie probably helps explain why the movie never got out of pre-production….
why does "chris gaines" look like onision 😢😢
So crazy finding out Garth Brooks was the first emo.
There's a South African artist who actually did this for real and he wanted people to be genuinely confused about his identity
"The strange case of Dr. Brooks and Mr. Gaines"
Dannny just blessing us with 1 episode every week. He started posting more often then before having a child
All this Chris Gaines resurgence has finally clued me in that Garth Brooks is not Billy Ray Cyrus 😂😂😂  I swear to god, I thought Hannah Montana was the 2nd attempt at the concept. I have been hating Miley's dad this whole time, thinking he was living unrealized dreams through her 😅
Isn't this like that one time...with the tiktoker
I love robert for giving us danny content
His alter ego in the thumbnail looks so much like onision, I took psychic damage from remembering he exists.
"Darth Brooks" would've been perfect
Wanna know something even funnier about Garth Brooks? His first name is *Troyal*
Garth Brooks walked so Paul Zimmer could...crawl.
is Garth short for Garfield?
Can't stop thinking that "Chris" looks like Onision
Smth smth, pot and kettle
Chris Gaines is just Jared Leto and Chris Angel morphed together
No sparkling water? Dissapointed.
As someone who grew up loving Garth Brooks, I’m shocked I never knew about this!
2:35 HE IMMEDIATELY CALLED HIM BARF AGAIN LMAOOO
I feel old
With every passing day, I suspect Robert
Garth was famous.. but not like the most famous.. not by a long shot dude :)
I never got into Garth's music, but I didn't hate Chris Gaines' album. There was one song called "Right Now" that was a spin-off of sorts of the Youngbloods' "Get Together" (one of my favorite songs). Totally got into it.  Also, if you want a more tongue-in-cheek story of popular musicians taking on an assumed identity, go check out the origins of the Traveling Wilburys.
Roberts job is to find crazy shit that Danny should look at while filming himself, love that for him. Thank you, Robert
Referring to Garth Brookes as “musician” makes me feel like I might be too old to be Greg
This is classic robin sherbatsky Going from teenage popstar to goth at the height of her fame
This reminds me of another intricate case of extreme pseudonimity. Stephen King released some books under the name Richard Bachman, more to test if his book sales were because of talent or fame. He came up with this whole backstory and famously held a funeral for "Bachman" after the pen name's death. His "relationship" with his pen name and the subsequent funeral gave inspiration to King's psychological horror The Dark Half.  re: Garth Brooks, I remember reading mid-90s that he didn't like country music and his fav genre was metal (don't know if he specified which metal)
Danny didn’t know of any Garth’s? Someone make him read Garth Nix’s books (THEYRE AMAZING)
Why does it look like Garth Brooks took the entire 'Chris Gaines' look directly from Chris Angel?
Never heard the name Garth?! Ya gotta watch Wayne's World, Danny!
I feel like this is something that Kanye would do
Ok Danny talks about where the name Garth comes from but doesn't talk about the fact that Garth Brooks' real name is Troyal??? Huh????
i love how robert sends danny on a little webquest every video, like he's a history student doing his schoolwork
thank you robert
Robert’s been killing it. Way to go team
Danny we all know you’re learning this because you have an altar ego, give up the gig
"Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts."
Robert looks like discount Elon Musk
I was also 5 but I grew up on Garth Brooks! My mom loves Garth Brooks! 😊 She HATES Chris Gaines! 😡
DARTH Brookes!  🤣 Chris Gaines  = Chris Angel /trent resner 💅
where are the bodies chris gaines
Didn’t Beyoncé have a thing with Sasha Fierce or something? I don’t know all the details so I wonder how similar/different it is
Like if you're a diehard Robert stan
it’s like when your main is maxed so you start a new game file
when is the robert reveal that picture looks like its from 2008
Hannah Montana actually did release an album basically called I’m Miley Cyrus: “Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus is a double album with vocals from American singer Miley Cyrus. The first disc serves as the soundtrack for the second season of the television series Hannah Montana, and is credited under Cyrus's role as the title character Hannah Montana, and the second half as Cyrus's debut studio album with all new original recordings.” The front of the CD case was Hannah and the back was Miley lol
His alter ego in the thumbnail looks so much like onision, I took psychic damage from remembering he exists.
ROBERT! LET'S GO
Garth Brooks lived in my town growing up. He once saw a family struggling to get home in bad weather and bought them a car. He's a really nice guy. Very charitable.
chris gaines is like a scott pilgrim character 😭 or like garth brooks’ mary sue oc with an overly tragic backstory
Ok when’s the “I tricked the world into thinking I was Cady in mean girls” video coming out
I lost it at the definition of Garth
i feel like  garth is really copying elliot smith
where are the bodies garth?
Danny you should DEFINITELY react to decedents 😂
the way they wrote Gaines' backstory is exactly how catfishers lie - then my mom got cancer, then my brother went to jail, then I got diagnosed with a rare condition no one else has ever had before..........
Thank you Robert Thank you Danny . . . Love you Danny
All of a sudden Garth became a cult-ier name than “Chris Gaines” ✨💀✨
okay but… that’s Onision. like that’s just onision isn’t it?
Counting my lucky stars that I was born WAY too late to have been a Chris Gains stan, bc he WOULD have caught me low key✨🤣💀🤣✨
We love Robert
So you pay a guy to come up with a curate a video then just wing it in one take? I'm not watching that crap. Tell your content curator to become a content creator.
where are the bodies garth?
chris gaines reminds me of onision
It’s GIVING ME LIFE, that Garth Brooks had a hardcore and very public emo phase.✨🤣✨#yessir
I did not think Danny would get into Garth Brooks in a video
I'm getting Criss Angel vibes from Chris Gaines
😂Are you kidding?! I thought he had like, hood friends✨🤣✨ not friends trapped in a well✨💀✨
🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯💯💯
chris gaines and criss angel are the same person. i'm convinced.
emo danny will forever haunt my dreams
Down here in tokelahoma. You heard him on radio constantly. The. Carrie underwood got on American idol.
Not his friends in the well 💀
Love the Eddy 9-pins merch.
that’s the most hypocritical title/thumbnail i’ve ever seen
This is not helping the fact that tom and Christina are saying he’s a serial killer
This is kind of random, but apparently one of my family members dated Garth brooks
I remember when this happened since my whole family were huge Garth Brooks fans. I still love his old music and it’s still not on Spotify. My mom bought the Chris Gaines album specifically because it was him, and ended up playing it all the time. I still remember all the words.
Reminds me of that one TikTok boy that changed his identity and that Danny reacted to and met a few years ago
I’m Eating A Bowl Of Pickles :)
Why don't you copy stanz and have Robert tell you about the topic
14:10 okay wait hold on. Didn't that car crash thing happen to Mark Hamill?? I get that this event is probably a common thing to happen to people but I can't help but imagine he just took what happened to him and used it for his own alter ago
14:41   One might say... A Series of Unfortunate Events (TM): The Miserable Movie
So I never saw this when it happened, but as soon as I saw the look he was using it was very clear he was just trying to make fun of Liam Gallagher. If you don’t believe me, just look up pictures of Gallagher in the mid to late nineties.
Genuinely no offence to the researcher but a few of these articles seem like they were written by AI
3:58  This is possibly the most random thing ever but i’ve recently learned that i am very distantly related to chip and joanna gaines. I’m not sure how distant, but idk it’s kinda cool ig 🤷‍♂️
Robert
14:39 bro just unintentionally described Iron Claw
More importantly… where are the bodies Garth?
❤
the bit at 7:42 was one of the funniest things ive heard in a while, thank you danny (and robert!)
SORT OF EARLY, AMAZING VIDEOIO
I have such a distinct memory of Garth Brooks dying when I was a kid... and now when people talk about him, I get so confused that they refer to him in present tense. I don't think I found out he was still alive until I was 25

I was 15 or 16 when he did that and, at the time, I lived in Oklahoma, where Garth Brooks was considered to be a god amongst men. I didn't pay much attention to Garth Brooks and especially not to Chris Gaines because I was all, "METAL ONLY! I'M SO HARDCORE! GRR!" I knew a lot of people that practically worshipped him though. His female fans were kinda into it because they thought he was much more attractive with a head of hair, but the majority of his male fans there absolutely HATED it, lol. They thought he "looked like the F-slur". Oklahoma in the 90's, you know. Everyone I knew who was a fan of Brooks thought that he was having an early midlife crisis and changing everything about himself, whether they liked it or not. I thought it all pretty hilarious watching these snowflake a** men around me losing their sh*t over it, lol.
unironically the songs slap
I remember Chris Gaines. That was weird. Not bad weird just, like, huh, ok then.
those bags under your eyes are so distracting
why’d he say pseudonym like that
I was in highschool at the time. He was extremely popular back then, he wasn't losing traction at all, he just got bored and wanted to be a rock star for a change. We all knew immediately, and roasted him to no end.
DANNY!! you do this EVERY (couple) YEARS!!! honestly find a new hobby (or dont i dont care) grrrr
In my city they apparently still love Garth Brooks so much that he had nine consecutive sold out shows in 2017 (it was 7 but they added 2 more shows) and then in 2022 his two shows sold out in 45 min!
Isaiah 45:22 Turn to me and be saved, all you ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no other.  We all have sinned, became sinful, done wicked in God's sight, by lying, stealing, coveting, lsuting, hating others, blaspheming, we all have Fallen Short of God's glory, broke His law, and we have all became His enemies through wicked deeds. There is coming a day where God will judge each one of us based off how we live based on the ten commandments God isn't willing that any perish. He wants us to live even through we have sinned, He sent His son to die for us so we could be saved even through we have sinned.  The only way we can be saved is through Jesus, our salvation isn't based off Anything we can do but based purely on what Jesus did.   Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures. (1 Corinthians 15:4)  Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God. (1 Peter 3:18)  your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from youso that he does not hear. Isaiah 59:2  Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 2 Corinthians 5:17  The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.   Romans 8:16  Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.1 John 5:12-13  For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. 2 Corinthians 5:21  But he was wounded for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace,and with his stripes we are healed. Isaiah 53:5
I like how he goes from the most Howdy Doodie guy of all time to like Anthony Kiedis fused with the dude from MCR.
"Let the conversation begin" h3 family rise the f up 🫡
Honestly I feel like there’s so many artists that would like to change their style, but they can’t because that’s not what people would expect from them.
i am subscribed with notifications i am Greg now
9:58 This clip just gives of vibes of that picture where Obama is giving himself a medal.
can't believe Danny missed the opportunity to say a series of unfortunate events..
Gareth > Garth this is just my unbiased opinion 7:49
i thought it was onision in the thumbnail LMAO
i thought you were making a video about Onision bc of the Chris Gaines pic in the thumbnail 😭 its so similar its uncanny
You didn’t know this? Danny lives under a rock lol he knows about Chip Gaines but not this…Danny really just watches HGTV all day
I have not been able to escape my mum blasting Friends in Low Places for like a month and then this video appears. This man is haunting me
Chris Gaines' dark backstory sounds like a kid making their first D&D character
2:38 glad chris gaines failed as an alter ego because respectfully that looks like onision with a goatee and that’s really cursed
Waco mention‼️‼️
Danny when you led with "a few years ago" about the viral tiktok song i stopped for a moment and had to really think because surely that can't be older than a year right???? It's been over 3 what the heck-
im from tulsa oklahoma where garth lives. he’s literally the strangest mother fucker ever. heard toured about him my whole life. you could do a whole other video on how weird his facebook alone. (please do this)
Chris Gaines backstory sounds like a CoHo character
2 Danny videos in a row where he mentions bigfoot.
we stan robert! (i think)
Me patiently waiting for you to bring up Paul Zimmer: 👁👄👁...  video ends with no Paul: 😟... what a wasted opportunity Danny. The parallells are UNPARALLELLED!!!
i am loving the more frequent posts!!!
Oh I thought that was onion boy in the thumbnail
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages/punishment of sin is death (Romans 6:23), you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus, as God in the flesh, died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that Christ is Lord, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
its like when a kid makes any characters; give em extremely tragic backstories, make em emo/scene and edgy
Chris Gaines looks like Onision
Why are these articles written like a middle school book report though
Are we sure this just isn’t fetus danny
straight up thought that Chris Gaines in the thumbnail was onision
I understand having and wanting an alter-ego because I once made an alternate Twitch account to jokingly mess with friends for an entire year, just acting like a new follower and even roasting myself! It was cool to have and even developed a personality for someone that was just me XD
I think Brooke took inspiration from chris angels. But a singer and more magic
Why is your thumbnail always a pic of yourself in what looks like landscape mode 😂 always stretched out lookin like a thumbnail from 2015
9:36 oh that was just her reputation era
Joji was extremely successful in changing his career
wait no you're not seeing the vision this is high camp
Um...Garth from Wayne's World??
danny mentioning taylor swift pretending to be someone else in a music video when “the man” music video exists 😭
5:43 wait till danny finds out about the album Hannah Montana 2 / Meet Miley Cyrus
Gotta send this to my mom. She loves this guy's music.
3 WEEKLY VIDEOS?? DANNY WITH THE CONSISTENCY IS FEEDING US 🙏
A NEW Danny video??
Thank you Robert Button 👇
"Barth Brooks" made me choke
dude chris gains is just the country version of a marysue oc
Troy Becker 2
@YMH - Danny found out where  Garth is hiding the bodies! 🫠
This is like an alternative Paul Zimer/Troy Becker situation
Where are the bodies Garth?! 💀🦴
His alter ego in the thumbnail looks so much like onision, I took psychic damage from remembering he exists.
My partner and I are old and my partner used to work at tower records  during that time, he said people would come in and buy multiple copies of the Chris Gaines album because they thought everyone would eventually figure out who it was and what it was and that they’d run out of copies of it… lol. Little did they know they’d be able to get it for a dollar in the next year out of the bargain bins.
This man looked like Onision
Welcome to the trickery of media. - Gen X
Yeah no one can do it as good as danny
my first fish i ever owned was named garth
We love Robert THANK YOU ROBERT!!!
Thank you for making content.
why is no one mentioning the fact that the alter ego is australian???
He actually made money on that album.
this is like the movie popstar but if they did everything wrong and it was terrible
paul zimmer and now this guy…. well he was actually first but still
You never heard of the name Garth? Did you not see Wayne's World?
as someone who was 2 in 1999 this is incredibly fascinating
Chris Gaines is Garth Brooks oc that he cosplayed and i won't be taking criticism
If Chris Gaines comes back, fox szn should too
Chris knows where the bodies are buried
So I've done a lot of research into the Chris Gaines phenomenon and... I just want to clear up a few confusing tidbits. First off, the album was originally released as "Chris Gaines Greatest Hits". His backstory includes being in the band "Crush" (he and his bandmate wanted to be the new Lennon and McCartney) and then going on to do some solo projects. Another important tidbit is that while he was doing this stunt in 1999, Garth Brooks and his then wife were separated, with his divorce happening a few years later in 2001. With that context in mind, his VH1 Behind the Life documentary is a WILD ride. The amount of time spent discussing his sex addiction is insane and plays out like what a middle schooler thinks sex addiction would be. Pair that with the fact that he was separating from his wife and it looks like he's severely overcompensating with a character that HE CREATED by making Chris Gaines a rocker sex god. For more context, I made a helpful video analysis: https://youtu.be/rC-VjV8cDDw
Garth brooks the serial killer!  - tom segura
Ok I thought the second picture in the thumbnail was Onision for a second and was very frightened lmao
Chris Gaines knows where the bodies are
Hahah I wonder if this is the blue print Donald Glover/Childish Gambino followed
I feel like this was his attempt at hemorrhaging the dark and negative parts of his psyche. it's a great performance art piece tbh
We knew he was Chris Gaines and he knew that we knew. He did it as a joke. And Garth Brooks is a good man and very much still in his prime. He doesn't need to be made fun of.
Oh no, I’m old
not danny trying to cover up his embarrassment by telling the garth lore 😂
I wonder if they ever collab 😂 took me out.
I was almost 20 when the whole Chris Gaines thing happened. We didn't really know for a while, the suddenly everyone was mad.
is robert real……….?
Where are the bodies Garth?! The families need closure 👖
lol I love how Danny uses “googling something” about something that happened in the 90s 😂😂😂😂
Nobody's look has ever screamed "Magician" like Chris Gaines.
i think elvis is the best seller i saw both but more articles said Elvis i only saw one that said garth brooks
9:00 Chris Gaines walked so that Sia could run.
Ngl as someone who has been on the internet a while I thought that photo in the thumbnail of gains was Onision 😮 I was very confused about Danny's content 😅 great vid 😊
Fell asleep listening to Garth Brooks and woke up to this lol. Gonna fall asleep listening to Norwegian folk metal next and see if Danny talks about it.
He looks like Snape
are you hitting your microphone or something. what is that fucking vine boom noise.
you might say chris gaines’ life was a “series of unfortunate events”… 🤔😅😂
robert knows all, we love robert!
This has been my Roman Empire for so long.
chris gaines looks like onision...
a few months ago I was at a writing camp where we learned about Chris Gaines and then did an activity where we took genres we didn’t write about and made up a persona who did write those book genres. The counselor said we were “Chris Gaines-ing ourselves”
Okay… I don’t want to take credit away from Robert if he is real bc that would suck BUT I fr think it’s another trick. You’re Robert right? Like you say the same exact line every video now and a pic of not Robert and something is fishy. Plus you can’t blame us for having trust issues with you Dannyboy. I’m unsettled lmao
I was going to say he should combine with his persona and start a moody country rock act, but then I realized that Garth Gains sounds pretty horrible.
Im sorry but why did i keep thinking he looked like adam from three days grace lol😅
garth brooks put on one of the best shows i’ve ever seen in my life
I agree that it seems like he wanted to actually become Chris Gaines, then pretended it wasn’t serious when he called out.  This really just gives me the vibe that Garth Brooks had a mid-life crisis and/or psychotic break.
Garth Brooks looks like Doug Van Housen from animal room lmao
i knew about this cause my dad was a huge fan. im so excited to see someone cover this. its so funny 💀
Hearing that GTA wasted sound makes me want to see Danny play it again
I Love Danny Gonzalez Videos 🩶
Anyone else suspicious of Robert
5:45 it's funny because Hannah Montana kinda did do that lol..... Hannah/Miley released an album in 2007 called Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus
Danny getting so invested in the name Garth makes me wish he realized his real first name is TROYAL
his edgelordsona looks disturbingly like onision, it frightens me
What happened in 1999? Is this a reverse: 1999 reference??
That music video has so much resemblance to I don’t care by apocalyptica and adam gontier
In 2012 I met a 19 yo boy named Garth. Blew my mind.
ROBERT!?!?!?!?!!?
Wait, his house was burned down by arsonists? I thought gardeners were the ones out there burning buildings down.
my dad used to play "friends in low places" all the time. I had no idea garth had a crazy backstory
Straight up thought that picture of “Chris Gaines” was Onision.
The single was released before the album? That’s kind of how most singles work…
Strangely, country artists, especially in the 90s, didnt make the billboard charts, despite having multiplatinum albums.  When the Chris Gaines thing happened, Garth was pretty up front about the chracter. The band Kiss also recorded a whole album for a rock opera that fell through, leaving them to release an odd album with no movie.  Coincidentally, Garth Brooks was a big Kiss fan. Btw, after the Gaines album, Brooks went right back to a string of multiplatinum albums.
Danny, you missed the best part when searching his name.  Garth may not be a fake character, but his real name is Troyell
Chris Gaines is the secret identity of sith lord Darth Brooks
My D&D chaotic evil forest gnome has a better back story
I like Robert
I'm actually crying laughing at the sentence "a garth is an enclosed quadrangle or yard, especially one surrounded by a cloister"
thats him serving 😭
Cult leaders wear black and white Nike shoes.
Why did he turn himself into Chris McLean from Total Drama Island?
Wait until he finds out about Ethel Cain
I love you chris im your biggets fuann :) #music
The original Hannah Montana
I genuinely cannot tell if your Miley Cyrus joke is just self aware or if you actually didn't know there is an Hannah Montana Album called Meet Miley Cyrus
Garth went broke
Is it weird that I’ve never heard of Garth Brookes?
im so happy someones talking about this bc me and my friend have been laughing at the idea of someone going to a garth brookes concert and getting Chris Gaines & also hoping for a comeback ever since he showed me he owns the Chris Gaines CD and made me listen 😂
Never heard of either of these names.
Thought this was Onision and I was so scared
"a special team of content curators, which consists of one guy (his name is Robert)" is becoming danny's "the premium channel that Is free (it is--it is free)"
flash warning 1:30, ow ow ow ow ow
DO MORE REDIT VIDEOS
My dad actually knows people who were friends with Garth Brooks in high school, and he orginally wanted to make Rock music.
where are the bodies, Garth? the families need closure
Yeah Danny I'm pretty sure fox szn is Walter white because he needs a new life and is embarrassed of his past. come to think of it why did you make this video Danny I think you knew about this story and you were trying to give us hints that fox szn isn't you it's Walter h white who paid you to do this for him
thank you robert
why does chris gaines look like a early 2000s pete wentz mixed with criss angel lol
All my homies love Robert
i’m kinda rocking w chris gaines im ngl
danny is this you trying to throw us off are you chris gaines
Chris reminds me of Jared Leto
Is this where the creators of Hannah Montana got their idea from?! That's plagiarism!
shout out to Robert <3
I mean, I feel like it’s one thing to caricature a facet of your personality and release music under it and another to just deny that’s what’s happening. Like Adam Young has released music under the pseudonyms Owl City, Port Blue, Swimming With Dolphins, Windsor Airlift, and Sky Sailing but I’ve never seen him deny that all of those were him. So weird!
IEREDE
ur disguise looks IDENTICAL to my old gym teacher . what the fuck
YHM mommies assembleee Tom and Christina have to see this, especially the part about having Tommy as a friend 💀💀💀
Pretty sure Vanilla Ice tried this too. Pivoted to rock with a new name…
bro looks like onision
Chris Games looks like off brand Severus Snape, I'm afraid that that he'll smack me on the back of the head with the Daily Prophet
Wait until you guys learn about Cee Lo Greene and Gnarls Barkley…
Song fire
Did anyone else think that pic was onision?😭
Fox Szn looks exactly like my ex, but Danny looks nothing like my ex. It freaks me out.
13:40 why would he make himself such a dark backround??? 😭
Danny and Kurtis both posted in two days. A blessing in Da Skies!!!
You should look into the beef he has with Tom segura!
Chris Gains sounds like a modernized Phantom of the Opera
Wait a minute, didn't Drew Gooden do this like 4 years ago?
Chris Gaines looks like a Walmart criss angel that had a come to Jesus moment
The man wanted to play New Game +
Danny please look into where Garth is hiding the bodies. The people want to know.
Country charts are separate from the billboard charts so GB was getting number 1s on the country chart and not charting on billboard cuz it wasn’t playing on those stations
Lol I absolutely remember this. I was a teenager going through my backstreet boys phase though so I did not give a single damn. We all knew it was him though, I don't think he was trying to pretend it was an actual different guy.
8 hours ago
He just cosplayed as Criss Angel for a bit
Tbh Garth is pretty hot without that freaking beardstache. He should've let it go
great vid
The reason why he’s the #1 selling artist is because he repackaged 7 albums into one box set. So each box set sold equals 7 albums sold.
No but the Taylor analogy doesn’t even work because she was the brunette in the you belong with me MV and the man in the man MV and nobody realized….. she could pull it off way better
Chris Gains❌ Chris Angel✔️
Hickey or rash Danny
I remember at one point saying I don’t really like Garth Brooks and everyone around me thinking I was lying because “who doesn’t love Garth Brooks?” Me. I don’t love Garth Brooks. Only song I like is Thunder Rolls but a cover of it done by a rock band
I think Garth brooks is the alter ego
The subtitle at one point said "Darth Brooks" and, not sure if you actually made that joke or not but that's 100% what Garth Brooks shouldve called this alter ego
Admittedly, the Gaines album wasn't that bad. It wasn't going to light the world on fire, but it was decent pop rock, probably something to be played on adult contemporary stations. I am very glad that Garth went back to what he's best at.
I was a teen when the Chris Gaines  thing happened and it didn't make sense then either. Garth Brooks is fire in the right mood though
Old lady watcher here. At the time there was no mention of a movie. He hosted SNL as Garth Brooks and the musical guest was Chris Gaines. We had no idea what was going on. It was totally bizarre.
So I grew up only listening to country, I loved Garth Brooks... I have never heard about this before in my life.
The running theme of giving your OC’s the most tragic backstory possible existed even back then, crazy man
The Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus album has entered the chat
Hi my name's Danny, and I'm only willing to work for 1 hour a day, so I've hired someone else to do the foundational work needed for me to make a video that will make me enough money to pay him and keep 5x more :)
this guy is an inside joke within my family soley because it’s hilarious how he just went punk?!
Where are the bodies Garth?
I'm so happy you're bringing the story of Garth Brooks/Chris Gaines to the current generation. Incredible.
woah, is this an update on Paul Zimmer
paul zimmer
i thought the thumbnail was onision
I thought it was onision in the thumbnail 😭
In 1999, you were 5 and I was 20 with a 1 year old son. I'm old.
9:09 more fuel for those with Danny as a sleep demon 😃
For anyone curious, Garth Brooks is his middle and last name. His full name is Troyal Garth Brooks... It's apparently a family name. [This information has been brought to YT by my Mom, a Garth Brooks Fan who also just thought Garth Brooks went nuts during that time. ❤]
He's not one of the most famous people in the world, hardly anybody outside the US even knows the guy. Your country isn't the world, not even close.
👏 thank you Robert, the unsung hero of these videos
It was brilliant marketing at the time. Take an already famous person and give them an alter ego.   Then publish music, merch, and movies under that alter ego.   Same people and you double your sales, influence, and exposure.   But folks didn’t like the alter ego enough to keep the project moving forward.
Danny, we know Chris Gains is secretly you. Don’t try to cover it up.
This lends more credibility to the theory that Garth Brooks is a serial killer
This whole story is just a less gay version of the plot of the 1998 movie Velvet Goldmine
chris gaines looks too much like onision at all angles 😭💀
troy becker could never
1738 yah baby
Next you need to research into where Garth hid all the bodies.
His real name is so much more wild than Garth
"What was this movie? Just a series of bad things happening to this guy?" It was the late 90s, that was basically the vibe.
honestly I don't really understand what seems so strange about it, it's clearly just a side project, artists do it all the time (this channel is literally one of my side projects) just like you have this side channel, just with different names and/or personas, seems like he never even tried to hide it
fixer Upper fans! leave a like :)
Having Chris Gaines collaborate with fox szn is legitimately the smartest move Garth Brooks can make if he genuinely wants success for Chris Gaines. Like you just know so many people would listen because of the layers of insanity and irony and stupidity and hilarity
So you’re telling me that’s NOT onision????
i wholeheartedly thought that was onision in the thumbnail and i was thoroughly confused
Chris Gains is just Todd from Wedding Crashers
Garth Brooks is NOT the most selling solo artist in US history 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Dang
U cant just show a picture of onision and say its some guy named "chris gaines"
Danny going crazy w the second channel rn
My dad wrote wild horses for Garth back in the day! 😄
This reminds me of the Robin Sparkles/Robin Daggers episode of How I Met Your Mother 😂
Did somebody say Wonder,????
He should have called himself Quandrangle Dinglebrooks
I’m just gonna go ahead and say that I deadass thought that was Onision in the thumbnail lmao
The most impressive thing is that the person finding this elite content is a different guy everytime
ive always liked garth but my ex liked him even more so this video was a hard watch lol
this is giving fox szn and troy beckers baby.
Chris Gaines was creepypasta tumblr fanfic eboy before it was big
To be honest, this wasn't an entirely new thing Garth did. Back in the late 1930's, Hank Williams Sr. did the same thing. He created Luke the Drifter as a way of being able to release some of his music that had darker tones to it as he wanted to be able to release those songs to the public, but he didn't want such dark songs to be associated with Hank Williams (since Hank tried to keep his music more upbeat).  No one knew that Hank Williams and Luke the Drifter were the same person until well after Hank's death.
This was common knowledge in my house because my mom is such a garth brooks fan
I think the more pressing question is...WHERE ARE THE BODIES GARTH???!!!
Chris Gaines looks like if Ben stiller played Garth brooks in a movie
paul zimmer moment
Literally onision double
What if Danny is garth brooks?
Country fans are stupid
Hey he was my neighbor!!
Hey danny!! I was blown away this week end when I looked into aquestrians and horse sports. ITS TERRIBLE!! Yes most horse owners treat their horses like family. brut the professional events? the olympics? horse racing ALONE kills 2 horses a DAY on average, and the officials do nothing about it. Even if you don't make a video about it, I would still like to raise awareness for these abused animals. animal activist @ReleighLink makes youtube videos about this topic all the time. i want everyone who reads this to go and research the truth for yourselves. the more people who know about this the better.
Why does he look like Onision tho
Barf Brooks
Barth Grooks
I remember when this happened and he was really pretending to be "Chris Gaines".   It was VERY strange because it was so obvious.
Now if you met someone named cloister you'll know why
I love Garth Brooks. He’s a legend and seemingly a great guy. But this was a WILD swing.
It’s giving criminally insane Dewey Cox
i have to say i thought you'd be gone for so long and posting so sparsely after having a kid, which i would have to respect even tho i would be sad. but i'm thrilled to see you posting regularly and i'm sure you're still prioritizing the well being of your family, if not please do. <3
I think Chris Gaines was meant to be several things, a movie, a real character/project with serious music, and most of all, a scapegoat. He's a tortured soul, so surely he'll crack under pressure... right? Where's the FBI on this case? it's heating back up! Everywhere he goes, a few young fans of his tend to disappear... & not come back. Garth, Chris, everyone in there... it's been too long. Where are the bodies?? The families of those victims deserve closure!!
Where's the bodies Garth?
My dad calls him barf brooks 😂😂
Garth Brooks was my first ever concert...
Has he ever HEARD a rock song?
If you're actually curious, we were all (at the time) super well aware that it was Garth Brooks and that he was doing a bit AND that it had no chance of getting over. No one but Garth took it seriously. And he took it very seriously. The press surrounding it was unavoidable and then there was the whole mock Behind the Music episode.
Where are the bodies, Garth?
chris gaines walked so ethel cain could run
I didn't know garth went through a phase like this, but I have heard of the foxboro hot tubs. Now I am wondering if anyone else has heard of them either
he was definitely famous only in USA, no internationally
Where are the bodies Garth?
I remember this
this is what looksmaxxing on final fantasy XV looks like
Thank you robert
why does his alter ego just look like Onion
Hannah Montana? Oh wait he made that joke
danny, its not like we could google why is garth brooks pretending to be chris gaines In the 90;s.  the most we could do was join a chat room and ask each other. give us a break, we adoared garth brooks he was like a saint.  the he became the devil
is robert real?
I feel like it was him going through a midlife crisis. And a response to marriage issues. He divorced his 1st wife not long after this.
Garth Brooks in… A Series of Unfortunate Events Feat. Chris Gaines
Trisha and Garth both cheated on their spouses while on tour together. And now they are still married.
Its like hannah montana if miley was also famous
4:02 good cheese joke
In the words of G whenever he watches a soul leave a body, “I like that”.
omg i love borat <3 best movie
You referenced YouTube and Google a few times, and I just want to make sure you know those didn't exist in the 90s.
Watching you discover this in real time is hilarious 😂 My mom had the Chris Gaines cassette tape and honestly it wasn’t terrible. It was just such a random weird move and he never did it again
Shouts out Robert 🗣️🗣️🗣️
i really thought chris gains was onion boy and i was so worried
Omg! I knew about the Chris Gaines/Garth Brooks thing, but other than Friends in Low Places I didn't know Garth's music. Years later I heard Lost in You. Added it to my playlist. Even had it under Chris Gaines and swear until today I never put it together. Lol I thought it was ANOTHER Chris Gaines. I thought it was some wanna be Jon B or something. Lol
Garth has been hiding bodies for decades now! Come on G, we just want to put our grandma to rest.
Dude…. I was there. I remember seeing his CD at a K Mart. This was dial up era so you just had to sit there completely clueless to what’s going on.
I will always hate Garth for this lol
So is the next video gonna be about the life and times of Dewey Cox?
Please watch Your Mom's House with Tom Segura and Christina P. They will educate you on all the bodies Garth has hidden
Where did he leave the bodies though?
Chris Gaines kinda fine tho. I want that emo boy
Waiting for the plot twist that the content curation team is actually two guys, Rob and Bert.
All i know is my mexican father was so obsessed with garth brooks, he had an african grey parrot named Garth who, coincidentally, also drank beer???? idk it was like 2000 and i was 3
this is so funny it’s like jake hill who makes edm but also goes by dixon dallas who makes gay country
6:05 why does he look like Edna from the Incredibles
0:59 you cannot find out what Jschlinky did back in 99
"they're filming chris gains like he's bigfoot" sent me
Danny has obviously never seen Taylor Swift’s “The Man” video.
Garth brooks is a serial killer.
danny is a year older than me? shit i thought you were younger. youll look great at 65 danny
Fox Szn pretending to be “Danny” again don’t be fooled yall
Chris Gains looks like a Great Value Criss Angel.
No wait cause I think the songs actually sound good 😭
So when you're doing it, it's fun. When someone else is doing it, it's cringe?  Plus what's the deal with guy falling in love with his writer / co-worker? Life happens. Thought you'd be more respectful -,-
All I know about Chris Gaines is what things my mom complained in the car on my way to school lol
I was in High School when this happened, I’m pretty sure everyone knew it was him from the start. That was the first thing you heard about it.
Why does that guy look like Onision when he’s emo that’s scary if you don’t know who he is bloody hell don’t google him
bro fr made an emo self insert
Sup, Robert.
WHO THE FUCK IS ROBERT
Robert indeed
I love this, its so interesting to see lol
Garth brooks ARG
Irl tale of unfortunate events
Chris Gaines is Derek Zoolander.
The way I knew it was about to be Garth Brooks and just went YES YES YES when you said it
Chris Gaines fake manager looks just like House's hot boss
This made me feel like a quadrangle surrounded by a cloister
reminds me of when I watched a kansas documentery and, they were intervewing people who were insipired by kansas in one part and, garth brooks showed up. I was like what the heck is a country singer doing a  kansas doc turns out hes also a big fan of rock n roll too lol
1:00 reverse 1999 reference?
Guys I’m not a Danny fan anymore now im a ROBERT FAN🗣️🔥
Garth Brooks is also the world's most prominent serial killer. If you follow his tours, there is at least one woman who goes missing when he is in town and is never seen again. It's been happening since around this time. Where are the bodies Garth??
7:30 Party on Wayne! Party on uh, what's the other dude's name?
Thought that was onision in the thumbnail for a moment and got scared 💀
My name is Brooke after Garth Brooks cuz my mom is such a large fan…. 🤩🫠
I'm pretty sure that's just Onision
just leaving timestamps here for myself lol  1:55 7:40  12:43
Funny because Taylor Swift started with country music to weasel her way into music.
i would just like to thank robert for making all these powerpoints. robert i am not sure if you are real or not but if you are i love you.
Damn Garth's wife upgraded from a ghost writer to a ghost rider
It's insane to me because I do not at all recognize Garth Brooks, but I do recognize Chris Gaines
0:59 Don’t let Schlatt hear you say that…
no because when taylor swift wore a brunette wig in the you belong with me mv i genuinely thought it was a different actress for YEARS… i for sure would have fallen for the Chris Gains act…
I just listened to the album, and honestly, it was pretty good. 💀
There is no way Garth fucking Brooks is the best selling solo artist of all time. More than Micheal Jackson? Elvis? Beyonce? Madonna? Drake? I dont know where they got their data but someone is lying.
I was around 20 when this all happened and let me tell you what. We were all very confused. And I didn't listen to country but I sure knew his music because it was literally everywhere. We thought he was having some sort of breakdown.
I have never been a huge fan of Garth, but I would stop whatever I was doing and watch the video for The Thunder Rolls every single time it popped up on MTV (you know, back when they just played music videos all day).
Ironic Danny is making this video...
I just need Garth to tell us where the bodies are once and for all, it's been way too many years
it’s the way the disney actually did release an album for hannah montana called meet miley cyrus lmao
But how many bodies does he have in his basement?
garth was ahead of his time idkkk
Slow day on the internet you have to dive back in history?
I wonder if sometimes successful people do stuff like that to try and prove to themselves that their success is a product of their talent and hard work, not luck. I'm sure talent and work are part of it, but knowing the right people and being in the right place at the right moment makes a big difference. Rowling did something like this too, writing under a pseudonym, even though she would've sold more under her own name.
Wait till you learn about the body he hid and hasn't got caught yet
It doesn’t help that Garth Brooks is just an odd dude, creepy and weird in interviews even acting as himself
His friend's plane had to crash because he's not allowed to have friends in high places.
“Cult leaders don’t wear shoes in case you didn’t get that reference” *camera pans to danny barefoot*  #GregTheFastestGrowingCultOnTheInternet
One time my mom went to a Garth Brooks concert and she broke into his jeep 😁✌️(like I’m not joking this happened)
Why cause Chris Gaines look like onision it’s freaking me out
This whole thing was so weird. My mom actually had the Chris Gaines CD and she listened to it CONSTANTLY. She listened to it more than she listened to literally any Garth Brooks album. There's some decent songs on it but its just. Weird. It's so weird. And the fact that the movie never came out just leaves it as this weird cultural artifact. Like imagine a game that gets canceled, but somehow the soundtrack comes out anyway and gets really popular. Like what the hell?
Robert appreciation comment. You go man 🎉
Hi my name is Chris Ad'diction Platinum Lostinyou Gaines and I have ebony black hair (that's how I got my name) with bangs that reaches my mid-eyeball to hide my car accident scars and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Pete Wentz (AN: if u don't know who he is get da hell out of here!). I'm not related to Garth Brooks but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I was walking outside Saturday Night Live. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of arsonists and managers stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.
I actually have a story that's a little similar to this. It's the story of the song 45 RPM by this Welsh band called The Alarm, that I grew up listening to and seeing live very often because of my mum. I'm going to talk about the story below, but there's actually a movie inspired by those events called Vinyl - it's a good watch, honestly, if you're into your comedy with an edge of 'kitchen sink' realism. The story goes, The Alarm had been broken up for about a decade before they tried to get their new music played on radio stations in the mid-2000s, but were turned away because they were considered 'too old' having been around and making music since the 80s. So what did they do? They recorded a new song under a different band name (The Poppy Fields), hired a bunch of young musicians to pose as the band, and then had that 'new band of hip young things' try and get their music on air. The wildest part of the story...? It ACTUALLY worked, and The Alarm had to step in and own up to it. Apparently some DJs in the UK from around then STILL refuse to play any of their songs after that stunt. XD It's honestly one of my fave songs by them as well, I used to dance like crazy when they played it live in my childhood and teens.
Garth Brooks had a multiple year midlife crisis where he became Chris Gaines, went through a divorce and allegedly had an affair with future wife Trisha Yearwood, and became a minor leage baseball player.  It was a wild couple of years!  😂
Plot twist, Chris Gaines is actually Garth Brook’s twin and he’s just super introverted and emo 😂 Garth pretended that they were the same person so Chris could disappear again if he didn’t get famous 😂😂
I can’t wait to tell everyone I know that Low Places is about friends trapped in a well
That hairstyle was really popular among emos and metal musicians at the time. Also everyone thought he lost his mind; I was like in Grade 8 and people started boycotting his music in the area I was in.
was Garth okay when he thought of that backstory though??? 💀
Ok so I haven’t watched the whole video yet but going off the other comments I’m guessing this doesn’t come up. The reason why Chris Gaines was a thing was because Garth Brooks was going to be in a movie called The Lamb. Chris Gaines was the main character of the movie and Garth Brooks would’ve played him. For some reason, they did all this promotion before announcing the movie, and since people reacted so negatively to it, the movie was cancelled.   tldr: the whole Chris Gaines thing was promo for a cancelled movie
Finally someone talkin about this yes
"Musician tries to change his identity and fails"  Hmmm...I wonder who's tried to change their identity, become a musician, and fail before...
I thought the thumbnail was Onision at first I had a heart attack
what if robert is another fake danny🤔
Stop trying to make Chris Gaines happen, its not going to happen
CHRIS GAINS AND FOXSZN COLLAB OMFGG
did ur baby scratch you
Did anyone else see the thumbnail and think it was Onision? 😂
I went to one of his country concerts when I was like 6
ngl I thought that was onision in the thumbnail…
"I've actually never seen Garth Brooks and Chris Gains and Chip Gains all in the same room together" This implies that if he saw only two of them in a room together, he would sooner believe that Garth Brooks was two people than think they were different people
9:40 iM nOt TaYlOr SwWiFt
You gotta ask garth where the bodies are, he's actually a serial killer! Maybe gains is one of his victims!!
I remember 'that' guy!
It definitely was at the height of his fame.
Garth be making his OC Ganes back story as tradgic as my OC's in my middle School writing...
Omg 😂 I remember this! Damnit..does that mean I'm old old?!
anyone else peep at 2:18 weirdest spelt wrong lol
Didn't Beyonce do that too, Sasha Fierce or some such?
Garth Brooks just wanted his Sasha Fierce moment
14:39 i think there was a book series like that once.
No “what’s up Greg”😢
I would have loved if Paul McCartney had done a lot of promo like this when the Thrillington album came out
We know that Chris Gaines and Garth Brooks is you! You can’t fool me!
My mom loved garth. He even started playing professional baseball at one point 😂  Identity crisis much?
I also kept thinking of Chip Gaines - also, he looked like Onision as Chris Gaines before Onision.
W Robert 👌
Shoutout to Crisis Hotline
I'm guessing this was inspired by the marketing for the Blair Witch Project, which went out of its way to make audiences believe it was a real documentary by having the actors lay low for a while, creating websites dedicated to the lore, etc. Kind of like an early ARG.   I think the VH1 doc, music videos, performances, etc, were just meant to make the character's world more immersive and drum up interest.
didn't this same kind of thing happen a few years ago with paul zimmer?
Sorta reminds me of Slipknot and Corey Taylors other band Stone Sour being completely different
chris gaines looks like onision  😭😭😭😭
Black Mirror did it right for the episode where Miley Cyrus plays Ashley O, a pop star. After the episode aired Miley released the songs from the show as Ashley. unfortunate that they didn’t decide to put out his movie/project before the album
Not gonna lie I thought that was Onision in the thumbnail 😂😂😂
As someone who was alive and somewhat aware back then, and a massive country fan, we had no idea there was a movie. Nobody told us there was a movie. We just heard that he had went off the deep end on drugs.
David Bowie did this sort of thing going back to the 70s with his Ziggy Stardust, Thin White Duke, and Alladin Sane personas. And even his later albums with Outside played around with characters and personas. Rapper Kool Keith also has a number of different personas that he releases music under. Notably Dr. Octagon and Black Elvis along with a number of others.I guess it was just weird for Garth Brooks to do it, because he is not as experimental and arty as Bowie and Kool Keith are.
idk if it's just me but I'm suspicious about Danny's friend Robert. idk if it's just the trust issues I have from Danny trying to trick us before but I wouldn't be surprised if Danny made Robert up.
im born in 2000. canada. and my ass was jamming to garth brooks most my youth
Shoutout Robert
That's kind of sick
7:45 I knew a dude named Garth, he was kind of a dick
chris gaines looks like onision and i find that hysterical
I sent this to my mom (massive Garth Brooke’s fan) and she said “Ah yes! I remember this.” ????
Genuinely thought that was onision in the thumbnail and I was so confused
I BELIEVE IN ROBERT
He pulled a Hannah Montana!
His alter ego looks like Onision.
But googling wasn't a thing in the 90's?
I'm surprised the Garth Brookes murder accusations didn't make it into this
Garth/Chris invented the emo haircut!
i'm straight up sobbing laughing over the backstory for Chris Gaines. this is what I do when I'm spinning characters in my head for fanfiction AUs.
Garth brooks....inside Chris Gaines
17:38 😎
w video btw im watching in vr rn
that back story is just a glorified edgelord from a ttrpg
Why does he look like a Onision, as Chris? 😂
I’m only a minute into the video rn, but I am am hyped your TikTok musician alter ego was mentioned. The RuPaul song that they’re using for runways on season 16 of Drag Race reminds me so much of the Fox Szn song that I end up with it stuck in my head after most episodes. 😂 it’s a conspiracy, someone at World of Wonder is a Danny fan and used it as inspiration for the music/beat of Cake and Candy! 😱
I still completely unironically adore the Chris Gaines album! It's really good. But I was relieved the movie never got made, I was afraid how bad it might be (not to doubt Garth's abilities but like why was he Australian?? lol).
Why does Chris Gaines look like Onision if he could act sane long enough for a close up
Yeah danny.. imagine if someone where to do that...FOXSZN...
Hannah Momtana who?
Danny u are my pookie rookie dookie bookie bear😍😍😍😍😚😚😚😚😚
❤❤❤❤
alter ego? call it alt and emo
Stephen king also did this with books he thought were too dark and twisted to release under his name
Barth Grooks
danny why are you uploading more videos than usual you have a child to tend to. father life must be getting to you huh? need to escape to youtube huh?
I went to church with Garth as a kid. He was a weird guy but honestly pretty nice.
My parents are country fans and the have a big cd collection.  I just went to see if they had any Garth Brooks and they have the Chris Gaines album 😂
Maybe its just because my mom was a teen in the 90s when Garth first got big but Danny not knowing about the Garth and Trisha drama and just being like oh he married the ghost writer is crazy to me I’m pretty sure I knew about that by the age of like 7 or something
Danny please check out kurtsworld it’s so relevant
we all love robert so much
I think Danny is pranking us again. We keep hearing so much about Robert but we never see him... I think... Danny might be Robert.
I kind of get what he was going for. Garth Brooks is known for country and he wanted to try something else but didn’t want it to be under the Garth brooks brand. His current fans wouldn’t like it and he wouldn’t reach new fans cause they’d assume it was country.  It’s like how Nora Roberts wanted to write mysteries even though she’s known for romance so she published them under J.D. Robb. It’s easier for an author to do that though lol.  Also I do feel like he took it a little too far with the background stuff cause that was kind of over the top.
Danny..you don’t have to lie…we know you’ve been pretending to be Chris grain and the garthey guy person thingy…😔
We have the Chris Gaines cd from when it was released. My husband bought it but as a Garth fan, I resisted the change of music style. Then I got hooked on a couple of the songs, with my favorite being Driftin Away. Everyone knew Chris was Garth. From my recollection, and I was 22 at the time, he created the persona due to the style of music being so different. There was a back story that was created for the character.
this is so random but all right i guess
Grew up with Garth. My mom loved him. Then he dropped his edgy alter ego album and I thought it was just the best. I mean look at Hootie he said call me Darius and imma rock you like a wagon wheel. Or even Aaron Lewis. Went from the amazing sounds of Staind to yeehaw I love my country.
This is going to hurt my feelings.  I didn’t know Garth Brooks had an alter ego and then got roasted for it. I’m currently watching with fear that it’s going to be life-changing. My dear, departed Grandma loved Garth Brooks and we never once heard anything about this!! I hope this is just going to be “cringe” and not cRiNgE 😭
I'm watching this with my owner/girlfriend
I was a teenager when Chris Gaines happened and the best comparison I have for people’s reaction at the time was the same reaction people had for Morbius. Nobody took it seriously and overnight it became a huge meme. Seeing his weird cringy emo face makes me laugh to this day.
Lol this man was being so confusing
havent watched yet but i know this is gonna be velvet goldmine irl
this dude also built houses with Jimmy Carter idk if he's real
I'm 47 (wtf when did that happen) and though I was never a fan of Garth Brooks, I do remember this weird stunt. The whole movie thing is just some revisionist bs. There was no mention of it at the  time. I think GB was trying to live out a alter ego fantasy, and it just weirded people out.
I can’t get over the fact that Chris Gains looks like Onision
Bro the only reason I know who Garth Brooks is is because one time my stepmom went to his concert. I've lived in Kentucky my whole life and didn't know he existed until I was 14, so how the hell is he supposed to be not only the #1 country artist but "the top selling solo artist" I smell bullshit lol there's no way he's sold more music than Micheal Jackson or Lady Gaga
Are we sure Chris Gaines wasn’t just five year old Danny
Garth is short for Gartholemew.
Its giving oliver tree.
Garth shouldn't have put his name to Gaines and denied it until after the song and movie were hits.
Yeah this was a weird moment in history lmao Even after all this time it's still just as confusing
I genuinely can’t stop laughing at the “friends in a well” joke. 😂
My 3rd grade teacher played Garth Brooks every day in preparation for this video. (This was absolutely when he was most popular,  and probably lead to his demise)
we all know that you’re Chris Gaines danny!!!
Sounds like he may have had a mid life crisis or a personality disorder
a topic you know all too well
Where are the bodies, Garth? The families need closure.
Well now I feel old, since I lived through this insanity 😅😅😅
Who is Robert?!? TELL USS DANNY!! Why does he mention him so often? I’m scared! We’re onto you Danny. You can’t fool Greg.
8:34 My mom said would it have been like Final destination about how sad Chris Gaines life would have been
UM HELLO WAYNE'S WORLD?? party on garth
I only knew him from his feature with Nelly. I genuinely did not know this guy was this well known. TIL!
robert needs a raise
why does he look like onision in that disguise
Wait!... Does Chris Gaines know where the bodies are then?? Where are the bodies Chris?
ok first of all, can somebody tell me who's robert? *wooow*
It actually isn't uncommon for artists(mostly rappers) to take on alternate personas to explore different projects and styles
I mean, Jared Leto is a rock star and a cult leader.
i'm from garth brooks loving Oklahoma, and let me tell you this is not talked about at all. #chrisgaineserasure
I’m surprised I’ve never heard of someone supposedly so famous but I also know don’t listen to and know nothing about American country music so that might be why. If you asked me to name a country song I would be unable to name even one.
very you
Is that Drake?
We need a robert cameo in the near future
Lol
He looks like Onision.
Chris Gaines
Chris Gaines is just the "original character DO NOT STEAL!!!1!" from Garth Brooks' preteen DeviantArt days, complete with angsty backstory
can’t girls just wanna have fun? can’t girls just create an alter ego with an extensive, tragic backstory backed up by fake friends and coworkers and release emo country music just for the heck of it? 🙄
i remember my grandma telling me about this cause she was a huge garth brooks fan lmao
im gonna pee > • <
Y’all won’t believe me but I have it in the best authority that Donald Glover did this too. Yep, believe it or not, him and Childish Gambino are the same person.
he is the only artist that I own actual CD’s of his music bc its not available on most streaming services  😔😔
Stephen King did this too. He wrote a number of novels as Richard Bachman
the robert pic is one of my favorite running jokes danny has
I'm Irish. Garth is a big deal here (that's a whole phenomenon). I'm also chronically online so unfortunately I knew this was about Chris Gaines based on the thumbnail. But I'll still watch regardless
anyone else think that robert looks like a franco brother??
His alter ego in the thumbnail looks so much like onision, I took psychic damage from remembering he exists.
Well I mean, look at Ashley O and Miley Cyrus. Same kind of concept but it actually make it to the screen lol
It's crazy AF that Drew Gooden is secretly suspected to be Garth Brooks. it's like they're the same fuckin person 😱
10:52
My mom told me this a week ago.  what a coincidence also it’s my mom’s only CD based on an unreleased movie also mom said he wasn’t wearing contacts he had “beautiful blue eyes”
we stan chris gaines in this house
13:48 that was me, i was feeling a little silly that day hehe :3
this whole situation is fucking me up so bad bc garth brooks sounds like such an edgy emo musician name and chris gaines is peak god loving country singer name. and yet.
All you need to understand is how CAMP 90s country music was. It was wild
i love reading all the comments from older folks , yall have so much wisdom and humor ❤😂💙
2:35 "Barf Brooks" lmao
Chris Gaines looks like he went and saw The Batman and thought “that’s me fr”
loving the abundance of 2 danny 2 furious content lately
come on danny, we know you're chris gaines 🙄
chris gaines is hotter
"I'm gonna be learning about this at the same time as you" sir don't act like some of us aren't in our late 30s
chris gaines and fox szn sounds like a very scary duo DO IT NOW!!!
I could have sworn the alter ego was Onision…. Why does he look like ONION ?!
not the vampire bite
you may try it again and again, but i will still not be convinced that robert is real
Country singer,  I lost my wife, I lost my pickup in that happy country twang.. Gaines one  b@ll to become who he wanted to be before  he was who he was. Emo, I'm so kinda sad. I wish I had two b@lls to be who I wanted to be from the start. Or maybe he was just going  through a midlife crisis.
That was interesting.  I did not remember this and am not a country music listener, nor am I American, but the minute you said the first line I knew it was Garth Brooks, so it was very effective marketing,  He just fancied a change in direction, Bowie did the same thing a few years earlier.
You should play lethal company.  Reason: it has nutcrackers in it
chris looked like onision
When Danny was going over Chris’s tragic backstory idk why but i automatically assumed the manager was a man and I was just like.. hell yeah… Chris is a gay icon. Get it
Yeah I plucked this gem off the shelves at Barnes and Nobles as a kid and my Dad was like heck yes let’s buy this. We loved that album. The liner notes have such intricate lore lollll
So… were u not the fortnight guy who sang at the streamer awards??
Danny, next one do Joaquin Phoenix’s hip hop career - even weirder story.
there's been a several years long joke in my discord where we say "on Garth Brooks" instead of "On god".
the outros are getting more and more abrupt and i am loving it
Thanks Robert for your hard work
13:15 When Danny is reading Chris Gains’ backstory my first thought was this is someone’s first DnD edge lord, emo character that they just gave THE MOST tragic backstory they could possibly think of. Like anyone else agree?
Imagine a whole ass band thats JUST alter egos of famous musicians
i think danny should watch i'm not there because it's just as confusing
Danny being confused that Chris Gaines has a full backstory, after knowing the intent was to make a documentary-style movie is pretty un-critical thinking.  But also he's a new dad.  I remember being absolutely fried then too
I LOVE GARTH BROOKS
Ok, the song being about his friends in wells made me actually burst out laughing. Love it. Thank you.
Chris is my bias ✨ can’t wait for their comeback
Genuinely thought Danny knew about and was at least little bit inspired by the Garth Brooks/Chris Gaines thing 😂  idk why but it's even more funny that Danny had no clue about it
I'm sorry but is Robert just an edited picture of Drew?? 😭
He looks like Zoolander.
if y'all just left fox szn alone
The whole world was very confused by this at the time. I don't remember anything about a movie. I think he was just wanting to play different styles of music than country. Not sure why he invented this emo character.
Garth Brooks, like the serial killer? There are no jeans in this comment section. 👖
Green Day's alter ego band Foxboro Hottubs is insanely good. Also Here Come the Mummies is a great band made up of anonymous musicians that due to contractual agreement can't really partake in experimental music projects. To get around it, they all just dress up as mummies and make the music they want so that way no one can know for sure who they really are and no one can tell them that they're breaking any areas of their contracts.
Hey bestie i think you might have posted this on the wrong channel?
Where are the bodies Garth?
This is the first time I’ve known what Danny was talking about before his video. Was in high school when this happened. It was so weird!
Danny this video had me laughing the entire time you are so funny
In Korea, creating an alter-ego isn't that crazy. For example, the most famous MC and comedian, Yoo Jae-suk, has like six 'characters'. It's like roleplaying lol. You have Dr. Yoo who runs a chicken shop, Yoo Dragon who's a K-Pop idol, Jimmy Yoo who's a CEO, Yoo San-seul who's a famous trot singer, Yoomes Bond or Yooruce Willis who are badass with a 6-pack. And everybody, including the media, just treats each of his alter-egos as their own person. You can differentiate them by what they wear or how they act. So, really, this guy was just ahead of his time and in the wrong country. Poor dude lmao.
i’m a huge fan of garth how did i not know about this 💀🙏
not everyone can be gerard way.... especially when my chemical romance didn't even exist yet
I like to believe this alter ego was all for the SNL mango skit where he admits they are the same people😅
That one picture of chris just looks like onision and I'm not a fan
Damn Robert’s working overtime
I think Danny should put on sunglasses for all the second channel thumbnails so we can tell super fast which channel the video is on
I'm Really Danny The new single Out today
Party on Wayne.
how have I never heard of garth??? I mean sure the only country singer I like is Dolly Parton, but still!!!
Funny the whole new alter ego, changing hair and outfits is what Bowie did 😅
When are you just going to give up and give both of your channels to Robert?
I've never heard of Garth Brooks. I'm 30, am I too old, or too young? Or too European? HELP!
Like Aaron Lewis the lead singer from the heavy metal band Staind went solo and tried to do country but he still also went by the same name didn't change his look and still tours and makes albums Staind
2:34 This is Garth Brooks, and this is Criss Angel Mindfreak
HELL YEAH ANOTHER ROBERT CAMEO
i love how robert sends danny on a little webquest every video, like he's a history student doing his schoolwork
the 2015 thumbnail is amazing
You know Tom Segura has the theory that Garth Brooks is a serial killer and maybe this whole alter ego thing back in 99 was when garth's reality broke and he has multiple personalities and one of them goes around killing people while on tour
I fear danny has roped more people into his schemes. Robert looks like an evil version of drew
As someone who doesn't wear shoes, I have to clarify that the group of people who hang out at my compound on a regular basis are legally not a cult, for tax purposes.
2:25 barth is literally my last name, ive been made fun of and called 'barf' but i never really got offended by it until danny said it ☠ .
Here's the tldr for people who aren't Danny fans; why did Garth Brooks create the alter ego Chris Gaines? Cause he's a silly lil guy
I just gotta say as someone who grew up around this - while it may have been goofy af, a huge part of the reason it wasn’t well received was because of how emotional, timid & feminine Gaines was. Garth made the mistake of building a fan base that despised the kind of man he portrayed with Gaines.
Side note, Garth actually cheated on his first wife with Trisha Yearwood. Then he went on to marry her.
Robert stays coming in clutch
Loving these weekly uploads man
thought that was onision
A Fox Szn and Chris Gaines collab would be amazing.
If everybody just quits making fun of me for just 2 seconds, just give it some time... then the music will speak for itself
chris gaines looks like onision???
This is so goofy I love it. I wish more celebrities did this. Like imagine if Gordon Ramsay was actually also Ina Garten 🙀😹
I bought the Chris Gaines CD because it was so good.  I love that he did that!  I'm a fan of GB but I have never bought his CDs or downloads of his country stuff.  TBF he is all over the place so I really didn't need to.
3:43 ME TOO I was just thinking about the only other Gaines I know being those guys lmao
ROBERTTT!
BRUH ANOTHER 2ND CHANNEL VIDEO?
one of my favorite SNL sketches ever was when Garth Brooks was the musical guest and Tracy Morgan pulled him aside and just trashed Chris Gaines.  Said he was horrible and even got Garth to agree.  After Garth exited the scene Lorne Michaels comes up to Tracy and said "You do know Garth IS Chris, right?" and Tracy said "I know.  Somebody gotta tell him"
Why did I think that was onision 😭
Ive not heard the name Garth Brookes in years, he was so popular
"Darth Brooks" would've been perfect
THE WAY MY HEART DROPPED AND I GOT SO HAPPY WHEN HE SAID TAYLOR SWIFT 🥹
Why does Garth Brooks kind of look like Tom Segura though
I was 19 when the whole Chris Gaines thing went down. If he was doing it for a movie, he never said it. I don't think there ever was a movie. To the general public, it basically looked like he got so arrogant about being so successful that he went artistically nuts and was genuinely trying to succeed as this new guy, too. He went full method, for a while Garth Brooks just disappeared. Everyone just laughed at him. I can't stress enough how hard he pushed that he WAS Chris Gaines and HOW LONG it went on before people stopped paying attention, and how badly it fucked up his career. He was not trying to trick people, he was legit trying to convince us he and CG were separate people. It was HILARIOUS
Fell asleep listening to Garth Brooks and woke up to this lol. Gonna fall asleep listening to Norwegian folk metal next and see if Danny talks about it.
This MIGHT be MF DOOM
whats most confusing to me is he's trying so hard to look as emo as possible, but.... this isnt emo music. I listen to emo and the stuff that influenced it. it doesnt sound like this. he doesnt know what hes doing
Was it Garth Brooks or Chris Angel, pretty sure that joke went round in the 90s, magic tricks for everyone
“At the same time as you”??? Sir, I PURCHASED this CD. I was a child, yes, but I was there when the magic was written
Chris Angle  was Chris  Gains the who time
Imagine if actors also just turned into their characters they played as….. for example:   Ryan Reynolds = starts becoming a masked crime fighting man with the ability to be shot and regenerate cells while making cocky pons and talks to random cameras  Owen Wilson = A physical car being with human eyes and says “ KA-CHOWWW” every 14.3 seconds
Garth Brookes just had a really weird Adam Gontier phase. Every time I see Chris Gaines clip it just looks like he studied for his character by watching 2 Three Days Grace music videos and that's literally it.
This threw me off because my grandma is friends with Garth brooks so we randomly met him in a grocery store when I was kid and I had no clue who he was lol
I really like Garth Brooks and been listening to him since i was young and did not know this about him at all, this is hilarious! Great video Danny!😂
why is robert just dave franco
You're telling me that is not Movie Star Actor Benjamin Stiller?
put his name in the title, Danny!
Garth: dis my OC guys oWo The world: ????
“ROBERT” 🤔🤔🫵🏻🫵🏻
Garth brooks is a national treasure
Where are the bodies Garth!
missed opportunity to call this video "Danny Gonzalez in... Garth Brooks in... The Life of Chris Gaines"
Hannah Montana literally has an album called "Meet Miley Cyrus" though 😭
I am old enough to remember this! I was 30 at the time and yes most of thought wtf!? Maybe Garth lost his mind!? There were many bonkers celebrity moments in the 90s, Michael Jackson marrying Lisa Presley,  Anna Nicole, Pam Anderson sex tape, everything was crazy! I thought Garth was coming out with a gay persona. I went to art school in the 90s and I was experimenting with ideas of persona, personality, personal allegory and myth etc. So it wasn't like this was so nuts, I mean someone like Madonna was a new persona every few years herself! I did like the song, you'd see the video but then think what in hell is going on with this guy.? He remains a little nuts to this day if you see him in interviews.
If taylor swift did this, Id assume she took weird drugs and assume the next album will be normal again tbh
I reference Chris Gaines way to much. Showing my age here. 😂 I remember watching him introduce himself as Chris Gaines and being so shocked. 😂
Wait why was there no greg.
i thought chris gains was onision at first
okay so i've been super obsessed with austin butler lately, and hearing people mention him is like the most surprising thing ever. what do you mean you know about him?
Chris Gaines is every 16 year old boy's first DND character
This reminds me of mf dooms many personas
Garth Brooks lived in my town growing up. He once saw a family struggling to get home in bad weather and bought them a car. He's a really nice guy. Very charitable.
Fun fact: My high school language arts teacher’s uncle is Garth Brooks.
Why did he pick the most A.I looking photo of his content curator lmao
His ulter ego is litterally just Chris angel 😂😂
I thought that Elvis Presley was the best-selling solo artist cause he has 1 billion sales worldwide (129.5 million in the USA)
Garth brooks is a serial murderer. Chris Gaines is also a serial murderer. Coincidence? I dont think so.
Danny, please get an adblocker
#1 selling solo artist? Wouldn't that be Elvis Presley? Then Michael Jackson, Then, Madonna and so on lol.
daniel on that content grind....!!! my critical thinking skills r saying this is epicccccc
Perhaps you need to watch the movies "Wayne's World", and "Wayne's World 2".
😳 DEAR LORD. U were FIVE YEARS OLD in 1999?!!?! Well now I feel SO old. So, so very old. In '99 I was GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL!!!!!  . . . & yeah, most ppl my age knows who Chris Gaines was. But I honestly don't think I've heard anyone mention him in many a lustrum. Many, many yrs. ago I read a book by Stephen King's alter ego, which was awesome, so some famous people r successful w/ it.
Are we sure this guy wasn't Danny in disguise?
Pretty sure Chris Gaines was convicted of being a serial killer.
I bring up the Chris Gaines incident  whenever I get the chance. It's like the world forgot. I REMEMBER GARTH. I REMEMBER!
So thats why I've been hearing a bunch of chris gains jokes
im loving this Chris Gaines comeback story line.
Danny just takes on the form of every artist and expects us not to notice. We're on to you, Danny.
i think more middle aged country musicians should have emo phases
14:41 danny have you heard of "A series of unfortunate events"?
Oh shit Robert Mention ‼️
i’m not danny gonzalez -danny gonzalez
2:38 very clearly a country singer and very clearly goatee onision
It actually makes perfect sense for a superstar to want to experience just being a musician again, without influencing or being influenced by their main brand.   Many famous artists have done some variation of this, though maybe not quite as comedically.
He wasn't trying to fool anyone. He wanted to do some different stuff and he knew his audience wouldn't like it, so he invented a person who sings different stuff. If you're interested in fictional musicians then may I suggest a movie called This Is Spinal Tap.
I find it so funny because Danny has tried to convince us he was someone else
Danny i still listen to Fox Szn regularly
Dont want to know who garth brooks is, WHO IS ROBERT?!
It’s like electra heart or sgt peppers but done wrong…
I don't think Robert is real
Keep them High and Tight
Who else is here watching and is so old you actually saw "Chris Gaines" go on Saturday Night Live?! 😂
14:42 truly a series of unfortunate events
something you would do
As a lifelong Garth Brooks fan, Chris Gaines is actually one of my favorite albums.  If people did their homework they'd know he was supposed to be promoting an upcoming movie "The Lamb" and by the way, that album, a "flop" sold over 4 million copies and had several Billboard top 10 hits. Like all he touches, this was a monster success
his 'disguise' looks like how i imagine onision /thought/ he looked in like 2017
“The masses weren’t ready”. Lmaooooo pls I can’t handle this
I've only ever heard of two people called Garth and they are Garth Brooks and Garth Crooks and I just think that's weird
"I'm gonna be learning about this at the same time as you"  How do y'all not know Chris Gaines lmao
sooo Chris Gaines = OG Hannah Montana?
Garth, where are the bodies?
whens the new fox szn song
I'm starting to think that this might be Danny's second channel and not a different YouTuber 🤔🤔
The world wasn't ready for this concept but I'm ready for it right now so another artist needs to do this   (also the music video seems to be pulling a lot from the grungy alternative scene at the time)
ngl thought that was onision in the thumbnail nearly shat myself
wait until this guy hears about Steev Mike
I'm a big fan of Garth Brooks music, but I'm curious to see if this'll get taken down because bro is insane. It's so hard to listen to his music because he's so extreme with copyrights and stuff.
Not gonna lie. Chris Gaines song was not bad. Funny attempt, but not bad song. Lost in you still my favourite, and one of my go to karaoke today
We love Robert
Garth Brooks also refuses to put his music on streaming services, so he solely relies on physical sales and his duo group Brooks & Dunn to make any money. he’s a peculiar man
I literally rewatched that video like 2 days ago 😂
whys this on the 2nd channel
I’ve never seen Danny and Chris Gaines in the same room before…
2 danny 2 furious 😂😂😂
I lived through this.
4:56 the fact he didn't say "how about you ghostride me"
I was working at Musicland in the Florence Mall when he did this. We were confused when we received these CD’s. We knew right away it was Garth. We kept waiting for the shoe to drop. But instead, this flopped. It was kind of hilarious. 😅
I’m not mad at it. Is it cheesy? Yeah. But I like when artists go out of their comfort zone to try something new.
I was today years old when I realized Danny is almost a 30 year old boy...
Bro I remember this happening. I was like 9. Like... Garth. Huh? Why?
This is something I would expect Evan Felker to do.
good job robert 😊👍
9:07 I don’t know about anyone else, but this is definitely going to become a new vocal stim for me🙏
Thanks for making me feel old as shit Danny
Im sorry danny but you are so fucking late to this lmao not sure why you made a whole ass video on somthing that everyone besides you knows about
I’m pretty sure I created a PowerPoint about this for school as a child. Do I remember any of it? Absolutely not.
i really think his biggest mistake was NOT trying to trick people. brad paisley-heads aren't typically going to reach for AFI, muse, or fall out boy. pop off on myspace, try to collab w those artists, market to the emos. THEN release some big movie or something. that would also limit confusion, and more of his fans might get behind it.
Chris Gaines' backstory is something that would be exposition dumped in the first paragraph of a fanfiction written by a middle schooler where their emo OC is the new kid in town and the main cast of characters helps him open up and realize he doesn't have to be afraid of love. There's 100% a chapter in the middle where Chris sings a song for one of the main characters, who stays quiet afterwards.  Chris, ears burning red finally speaks up "I told you. It's bad."  But then [insert character] looks at Chris, eyes filled with tears. "No! It's... beautiful."
Guys who so robert
Danny between you not knowing about Chris Gaines and you not knowing about Larry Bird, you're making my old man back hurt  edit:Made it halfway through and he says he's never heard of anyone named "Garth" which also aged me 100 years because that means he's never seen Wayne's World
This is what happens when people get too rich and don't nee the money. They do dumb stuff like this, and waste millions of dollars thinking they cna get away with it.
I'm sure others have commented but Hannah Montana's second album is very much called "Meet Miley Cyrus" so very funny that's the example Danny chose
1:08 1999 is when I was conceived :^)
I will bark for a Fox SZN and Chris Gaines Collab
Chris Gaines looks like Onision
To this day “Circus” is still a certified banger
darth brooks
0:58 schlatt quaking in his boots rn
The craziest thing is that Garth isn't even his real name. It's Troyal. Not Troy, TROYAL!
It’s like if Andy Samburg became Connor 4Real but Popstar never came out and he was Connor 4Real in every interview and appearance since!
how have i never heard of this singer...
Chris Gaines giving Chris Angel vibes
shout out Robert
Garth is obviously a prolific serial killer, i know this because my jeans are high and tight
Chris Gaines looks like Adam Gontier from Three Days Grace in 2006
5:43 wouldve been a perfect time to put up an image of the album "meet miley cyrus"
He looks like onison with a goatee
Garth brooks walked so Hannah Montana could run
Bonjour non ?
As a teen in the 90s and former country music fan, I did buy this CD knowing it was Garth. I had thought he came out with this alter ego to try and be relatable during the boy band era of the time.
Why does no one ever talk about the fact that Keith Urban IS Chris Gaines
14:40 I guess u could say it’s A Series of Unfortunate Events 😈
i’m thankful i wasn’t the only one who kept thinking of chip and joanna
You know who else changed there identity and failed? Dani. Know who else is a musician? Dani. Know who else is a his? Dani. We know it’s you John
He was creating a tulpa
Garth Brooks walked so Oliver Tree could run
3 hour gang
9:37 Taylor swift absolutely could release a music video in disguise and nobody would know. She played the mean girl in the You Belong With Me music video and somehow people are still realizing this (not me tho I knew from the beginning)
thanks danny i have always wondered what that quadrangle was called this will help me going forward
why does Chris Gaines look like Onision😭😭
so if Chris Gaines is Barth grooks..... and Barth Grooks is Garth Brooks.... if my critical thinking is correct.....then Chris Gaines has to be...............................................Ganny Donzalez!
Danny you should try and do this same prank.
The zoom out on the gains made me realize how disturbingly white their teeth are
No one can pull it off quite like Danny. (Danny cant fool anyone)
Here is meh new oc guys >~< hope u like:3!! Chris Gaines 27 _sex addiction_ _depression_ _dad died of cancer_ _rockstar_ _best friend died in accident_ _half wolf/prince of the underworld_ _hard life_
Chris gaines kinda looks like an emo zoolander
9:14 bro just described sleep token /jk
authors used to do this all the time tbh, but that used to be easier for them before the influencer age
Basically Garth wrote an OC he loved so much he decided to roleplay it for like a year. Totally normal tumblr behavior misplaced to 1999 bro country.
Brian Adams also did this.
Funny you mention Taylor Swift… watch “The Man” music video 😂
the title sounds weirdly familiar. like someone we know...
Chris gains walked so sasha fierce could be cringed at.
I lived through this. I didn't know there was a movie. I legit thought he wanted to dabble into a different genre of music and made this character to remove any confusion that this would be country music
I miss Fox Szn 😢
not gonna lie i thought that was onision with a soul patch in the thumbnail
"Robert" yeah right. We know it's you Danny
Chris Gaines is just his edgy oc lmao. he was roleplaying
Where are the bodies garth? the families just want closure
Fun fact Beyonce just came out with a country song
Yay robert
Woahh
Chris Gaines reminds me of when Peter Parker turns emo in Spider Man 3
Outside of his life as a musician, Garth Brooks is a really cool guy. Imagine current day MAGA Kid Rock, but the opposite.
Watch this also be Danny as a 5 year old being a prequel to the fox.szn video
Chris Gaines’ backstory sounds like a 12 year olds oc with a long list of all the bad things that they have been through
Chris Gains kinda looks like Onision
Who is Robert? What's his lore?
Thank you the content team (Robert)
A Garth is an enclosed quadrangle or yard, especially one surrounded by a cloister 😍
As someone who as a big fan of emo music in my middle class years, Gaines doesnt fit the look of a sad moody emo rock guy. He looks more like a dad rock musician
Can I just be in love with this guy?  En Serio!  He’s hilarious. And he’s hot and he’s hot. Can we just hate him for  a minute?  I want to be in hate. Yes. Let’s hate him. Fucker. Asshole. Just sayen.
Is it only me who thinks the name Garth makes it sounds like he is some kind of Sith country singer?
AAAAAAHHHHH DANNY!!!!!!
Chris Gaines sound like someone who would spot for me lifting weights in the gym.
Danny is going to absolutely shit when he finds out about the album Hannah Montana 2 / Meet Miley Cyrus
Little does Danny know about Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus
ok now everyone say "thank you Robert"
Of course Garth is a name. It's short for Garthfield.
i come from a family of massive garth brooks fans. this is the first time i have ever heard of this. i am irate
this is the first youtube video since your last video that made me genuinely laugh at loud. good job danny
15:57 THE MANAGER IS THE BOSS LADY FROM HOUSE MD HOW DID THEY GET AWAY WITH THIS
I'm an old and I remember when this happened. Back then and still today I firmly believe this was Garth Brooks having a mid-life crisis and wanting to try rock/emo/alternative music. The movie is a fabrication to explain it away when the career pivot failed miserably. I will die on this hill. Thank you very much.
i... thought that was Onision...
The fact that i love garth brooks music and never heard of this
I remember this. I was twelve years old, and didn’t know what an alter ego was. I was very confused.
Only reason I knew about this is because Garth was my neighbor growing up in Oklahoma. Cool dude although I'm still salty his pet wolves killed my family's rat terrier.
Chris Gaines looks like something my mom would’ve loved in 8th grade. I would be forced to watch his music videos on our tv right now😭
I don't think I'm your normal demographic but I remember this very well.  This happened at both the height of his career and Nirvana and grunge music.  At this time this felt like a bizarre response to adopting a grunge influence without understanding what resonated with kids and grunge.  Everyone was extremely confused by this and exactly what he was trying to do.
I've always been so infatuated with this lure because my dad was a fan of Garth and loved this part of his career 😂 rip pops ❤
That one picture of his disguise looks like Onision noooooooooooo
Who else is dying to watch the never realised movie?!
Chip gains is trembling
I love how trying to change your identity and failing is a running theme in Danny's content.
what garth loses, chris gaines.....
Thank you Robert, we love you
Would be cool to see Danny do a video about Green Day/The Network and their "beef" back in the early 00s
Do you think this is what inspired Hannah Montana??
Haven't gotten too far into the video yet but my family just brought this up yesterday cause Rihanna or Beyonce released a country album and my fam suggested she should've done it under a pseudonym like Garth Brooks
Troy Breckers is back, please make a video on it🙏🙏
14:39 Would you perhaps say… A Series of Unfortunate Events  *Cue the CSI Miami intro scream*
I saw the length of the video and remembered the song “17 38” then the guy makes a “skwAH” bird sound
that temu ad
I thought the guy in the thumbnail was onision 😭
Early team
Please Danny, you meant to say that it would be like Hannah Montana realeasing an album titled "I'm Miley STEWART".
What if Danny did the opposite and got a person to pretend to be him, whilst Danny and he Denys being connected to him
This very loosely reminds me of Scott pilgrim and Michal cera
I remember the Chris Gaines era well, everyone thought he was bullshitting. But no he was serious.
I remember when this happened and thought it was so weird.
I completely forgot about this lol my aunt was IN LOVE with Garth Brooks. Lost in You is a beautiful song and I'm pissed it's not on Spotify.
I'm not saying Garth is a serial killer, but you can't prove he not🤷
Danny you remind me of a fish
Should have said alter emo
This is like a reverse Lonely Island because they actually made a mockumentary called Popstar that they starred, except I don’t know if they did weird promo before the movie came out.
My birth date is when Chris Gaines came out, am I Chris Gaines 😮
If I had a nickel for every time Danny has made a video about someone famous disguising themselves to change their identity and failing I’d have 2 nickels which isn’t a lot but it’s weird it happened twice.
kind of insane with how big of garth brooks fans my parents are, i've literally never heard of chris gaines. brooks was on constantly when i was growing up and they still listen to him regularly... but i've never heard of gaines, despite him debuting when i was a year old. definitely going to ask my parents about this tbh  EDIT: i asked. apparently my mom didn't buy the album when it came out because she thought it was cringe. then went on to tell me garth brooks is "too woke" for her nowadays, which... okay. sure.
Incredibly funny that Gaines was Australian cause I saw him and thought of Keith Urban
Imagine if Brook's alter-ego went on the Masked Singer
Now I just feel old that people don't know this
changing your identify is one of danny’s expertise
It’s Paul Zimmer/ Troy Becker all over again
I'm excited to see Garth's yt video about Danny creating his many alter egos.
Man, I'm an old millennial and remember this happening .  I was super weird, and so confusing.  I had no idea a movie was suppose to be attached to the project😆 So funny you made a video about it🤣😆
He sounds like he was kinda going for the Simply Red sound.
Danny is Robert
"Just one guy named Robert." is the new "We like to get a little silly and drink sparkling water/ La Croix"
My moms a huge fan of garth brooks so this is crazy to me
Still waiting for it to dawn on Danny that Chris Gaines was emo before emo was cool.
Where are the bodies Garth?
Another Robert classic 🙏🏻 thank you Robert
I thought that was Onision ngl
Atp I only watch Danny for Robert
3:20 WHAT IS THAT MELODY.
chris gains looks like he was rejected from early panic at the disco
Ew he looks like mr onion
The first definition of Garth absolutely sent me 😂😂😂
omg my mom saw him in concert years ago and was so close to the stage she touched his boot! she was over the moon lol
Okay Danny you dont have to lie to us anymore, you can just say you were Chris Gaines.
Chris Gaines is Onisions father
Fricking hypocrite
Maybe Robert is Danny’s baby. Nepotism at its finest
Why does Chris Gaines look like From Yesterday era Jared Letto?
I feel early.
this robert guy is putting in the works
Looks like onision if you ask me. Maybe that's where he drew inspiration for his looks from or something (I mean onision got the idea from Garth)
Honestly, i was 10 at the time but i remember this and i swear it was out of nowhere and there was no mention of a movie until afterwards. In fact, this is my first time hearing about the movie. It seemed like we all genuinely thought he was just losing it!
Oh golly, my dad died of cancer. Damn that puts me in the mood...
I was in high school when this happened and it was just as odd and hilarious as you thought 😂
I deadass thought Chris Gaines was Onision
I've never heard of this man
Brk you had never heard the nsme garth? How?
Love the consistent uploads amazing ❤️
Don’t act like you didn’t try to do the same thing…don’t
we want a Robert reveal
Omfg... He did not cosplay Onision with a soul patch...😂
Listening to a young person describe Chris Gaines is wild. I was fully alive when this was happening, and my mom was all about it.
I worked with a bunch of newfoundlanders and one, when asked his name, would reply, "Dark"...it was a bit before we figured out he was saying, "Derick" with a heavy newfy accent (even the other newfies).  I wonder if Garth / Gareth is kinda the same thing...if "Dark" tried to say Gareth, it would most certainly have been "Garth".
Hey Danny! I used to work for Chip and Joanna Gaines. I just want to confirm that in the time I spent around Chip Gaines, I also never saw Garth Brooks or Chris Gaines. Weird…
Barf brooks poser maxing. 🤣
this was one of the most incredible things ever....thank u robert for this
Goodness. The little " barth??? Barth Brooks. " With the exhale made me laugh so hard for no reason.
I don't think i could've predicted a single thing that was said in this video
"1999 was when i was 5 years old" YOU WERE ALIVE IN 1999????
You didn’t even dig deep enough to discover his real name is Troyal!!
K.  So I'm 54 and can give you the scoop.  He tried to pass the CG thing off but was quickly busted out.  I never heard about an associated movie.  My rock loving friends never talked about him and I never heard a song of his on the radio stations I listened to.  Maybe easy listening stations hit up the office workers but no legit rock traction.
I'm old, so remember when this happened. Even with basically no social media, no one thought they were different people. It was a big flop. They were even making fun of it on his snl episode.
Wasn’t this like 15 years ago?
Garth also was against streaming services up until 2016 when he finally made a deal with Amazon Music to allow them access to stream his songs. Still not on any other platform which is wild because so many younger country fans end up not really being familiar with his music when they listen to country hits on Spotify or other services. He was (and arguably still is) HUGE but I think not being on streaming has hurt his recognition even if it really hasn’t impacted him financially.  I definitely remember watching that episode of SNL growing up. The whole Chris Gaines thing was bizarre.
"They're filming Chris Gaines like he's bigfoot," made me laugh so hard!
wait till danny years about kurts world and joe keery bc seeing random videos from “kurt” was so confusing
bro pulled a Hannah montana
The saddest part of Chris's life is that he looks like Onision.
13:28 is me writing a backstory for my ocs
Funfact: Gains is more known in my country than Brooks. By a lot. (Not meaning Gains was popular, just Brookes ... who's that?)
The name Garth...Have you never seen Wayne's World?? "Party on Wayne" "Party on Garth"
My mom loved Garth brook and I saw him when he was younger
Istg I've seen Robert before
he could’ve added anything to his new look…but he decided to add a soul patch
My favorite part of this video is Danny saying he's never heard the name Garth. LOL! I know this is way before your time, Danny, but Wayne's World is a hilarious watch! Party on, Wayne! Party on, Garth!!!  Party on, Danny!
We all knew Garth Brooks had gone crazy, but we collectively ignored it in the way you do when your grandma drinks too much and starts dancing.
Why does Garth Blaines look like onision?
Honestly with that intro I was so sure of myself that he disguised himself again
I Got scared when the thumbnail looked like onis*on…
Bros a wannabe Severus Snape
Collab with yourself
Kinda sounding more like a serial killer, maybe he killed Those people as gains and if he got caught he’d just back as Garth
my bought us tickets to a garth brooks concert last year, and on the way, i said “remember when garth went emo and called himself chris?” she was so upset that she told me if i mentioned it again we’re turning the car around 😭😭😭
Wdym most popular singer literally first time ive ever heard of this guy
From his look I was NOT expecting it to be like....R&B  He's dressed like Trent Reznor but sounds like Seal. What on earth
Is he trying to make us believe that Robert is a real person so he can use “Robert” to go undercover 👀
I called my dad and asked him about this and he said that at first no one knew it was Garth Brooks, and he tried to say it wasn't him, and very shortly people knew it WAS him so he admitted it, so I think you're on to something about the movie being an afterthought when the alter ego failed so spectacularly lol
damn bro let Robert in front of the camera 🔥
This reminds me of when Drew Gooden changed his identity to Danny Gonzalez..
Back in the day I laughed and laughed at the new Garth Brooks
Bro I’m so insulted by your lack of Garth brooks knowledge. Garth brooks didn’t “fade into irrelevance”, he retired after the big scandal when the world found out he was having an affair with his now second wife, Trisha yearwood!  It was the scandal of the century.
Oh jeez, now I’m officially old  I’m not sure what your sources used for THEIR research, but Garth never framed his Chris Gaines era as an attempt to hide who he was. He very much made the rounds on late-night talk shows as himself, transparently promoting the new music he’d recorded under a deliberate alter ego.   I might need to retire from YouTube now
critical failure on his deception checks
Fun fact: Garth left his wife of like 25 years for Tricia Yearwood. So in a way he was a dick like Chris Gaines his made up alter ego
9:07 Danny every month in a new video.
Where are the bodies G?
He was in his Sasha Fierce era.
This is my alter ego, ✨enita max wien✨
DANNY POSTED😈🤫
I havent even watched the video yet but came to thank you for always having a really well-mixed video Danny my ears are thankful each time I pull up your page.
Havent watched the video but ur probs better
bring back fox szn it'd be funny
Cloister
"It was a really popular musician"  "I don't listen to much music, so I probably won't know-"  "It was Garth Brooks"  *"WHAT THE FUCK"*
the Chris Gains alter ego looks just like Onision
Chris Gaines looks like Shane Dawson circa 2008.
It looks like onision
Rockstar Chris Angel vibes
This is like if Eminem pretended Slim Shady was a different person and made a whole movie about it
Why does the thumbnail and music video make him look like onision
Lol I was just talking to someone about this. 😂😅
okay I'll finish watching in a second but like Garth Brooks' alter ego LOOKS like Onision with a Soul Patch and I'm crying. I cannot. My mom's a huge fan, I grew up listening to him how did I not ever know about his Onion moment!?
WE LOVE ROBERT CHAIN
I love Robert. When do we get to see Robert on camera
so i think there was an interview done once where garth brooks was asked about why he always wears his cowboy hat. well the response was that he gave was " im bald as a thumb",  if i am remembering correct. so the chris gaines hair has to be a wig in my book. lol.
ngl... chris gaines kinda looks like on*sion 🤢
I remember this it was so fucking weird! and yeah grath brooks was insanely famous to country fans
that movie would've been a series of unfortunate events LMAOO
Garth Brooks looked at Trent Reznor and said, "I can do that."  Hence Chris Gaines: Like Reznor if the music was not even close to be edgy.
Gainer4life! My parents bought this CD and I'll never forget
My guy definitely doesn't know about the brilliant album Hannah Montana Meet Miley Cyrus 😂😂
I don’t trust Robert
I was born in 1999. Garth Brooks did this because I was born oc
I'm getting really suspicious of this "Robert" guy. Danny has mentioned him a lot lately. The guy has a kid but somehow he can suddenly afford a content curator now? What's the Reddit for then? I call BS
i thought this was onison 😰😰😰
Chris Angel!
its nice danny make videos creative commons :)
Hi
I saw the thumbnail and thought "is that onision?? 💀💀💀💀" very pleased to find it was in fact, not
WHERE ARE THE BODIES, G?!? Now Danny needs to look up the conspiracy theory on Garth Brooks.
once when i was allegedly very high i confidently said Marf Barf instead of Bob Marley and i am still getting bullied for that one
I actually own the album and like it. I don't like country and never listened to Garth otherwise.
I thought the title said “magician” until he said something about music but ig I’ll still watch😢
Man I'm still not over what a great moniker Fox Szn is
Thank you robert! day 1
danny are you sure you're not chris gaines?
Barth Grooks
“Musician (Who Is Not Danny Gonzalez, I Swear, I Truly Promise, Seriously I’m Being For Real You Guys) Tries To Change His Identity And Fails”
i tricked the world into thinking i’m garth brooks
This reminds me of that stupid stunt Joaquim Phoenix pulled.
Gorillaz singer : best of both worlds
Where are the bodies G?
maybe it's bc i'm european, but i have NEVER heard of garth brooks, or any of his songs
being irish, i love learning about garth brooks. bc it’s like. when i was 12 all i was hearing about was how the whole country was mad at him for cancelling his gigs. but now I’m like. hmm maybe there is more to this guy 😮
ROBERT! YAYY!!!!!!!
The second channel is slowly becoming more and more like the first. I’m not complaining. Danny’s off the cuff rants are just as hilarious.
Danny gonazolin
Surprisingly from what I heard in this video, it seems like Garth-Chris's voice is very beautiful. Maybe the man wanted escape from country for a bit and also had a fun time writing his deviantart oc. I might take a listen now because it sounded very interesting.
Chris Gaines looks like an off brand Severus Snape
danny IS in roberts walls and will make fun of him even though hes done it before (danny did it better)
Haven’t seen Wayne’s World?
Where are the bodies Garth!?
Derek zoolander
I think that Danny is “one guy named Robert”
Wow I feel so old 😂
01:00 jschlatt reference?
6:06 why are his toes out
i can't believe tommy tallarico died in a plane crash
i thought this was the main channel
I don’t get why Garth Brooks says he’s the number one selling solo artist in history, because he’s not? I’ve looked it up and no where can I find that he is number one. It’s all  Elvis Presley. He’s not even in the top ten. Is he just one big troll or something?
PLEASE I need the Chris Gaines and Fox Szn collab
We love Robert
Inside the booklet of the Chris Gaines album they had write ups about his fictional pervious albums and fake album covers. It was awesome lol.
I thought the thumbnail was a side by side of Garth brooks and Onision and i was immediately concerned
I'm a little worried at how consistently Danny is putting out videos now... you can be honest did Laura leave you
The thing about musical artists is that they also enjoy a wide variety of music, just like anyone else, but they're essentially forced into picking A Sound that becomes the only thing people want to hear from them, and is therefore the only thing their producers and labels will let them sing. So it's not uncommon for them to get really bizarre in their attempts to break out and try something new. Sometimes it's forgotten about, sometimes it becomes a meme, and sometimes they genuinely completely change their music and persona and people start coming up with conspiracy theories about them having died and replaced with a body double.
In this video, Danny finds the bodies Garth Brooks has hidden.
“As the same time as you” when I literally remember this happening when it happened 😂😂
I LOVE YOU DANNY PLEASE ADOPT ME
There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about Chris Gaines
he looks like criss angel
142k in 2 hours is crazy
How did you not know the name Garth? Have you not seen Wayne's World?
You never seen Wayne's World
Article: the albums were fictional  Danny: wait the albums were REAL??
yung lean did a similar thing when he created jonatan leandoer 96 to keep creating music without the pressure/ stylistic restrictions of yung lean but he wasn’t tryna pass it off as a different person 😭
At first I legit thought this guy was Onision.
He wanted to be Hannah Montana so bad…
where is chris gaines when we need him most 😫 lost in you is a really good song
Loving how he still wears his buddy Eddie's Yikes merchandise.
3:03 literally the plot of the 2009 Swedish movie Bröllopsfotografen (The Wedding Photographer)
Not Chris Gaines looking like a certain onion boy
not going to lie i really thought chris gains looked like onision
Were trying to say BARF Brookes at 2:38 though?? lol
Actually it wouldnt be instant it would take 8 minutes for humans to know because thats how long it takes light to get to earth from the sun
love how much posting Danny has been doing on his second channel recently :D
Where are the bodies, Garth?
Ah yes, Garth Brooks, well-known vampyre
dude changed country music , he is the one who brought us country rock imo..dude is a great artist
The Chris Gaines backstory is like when an angsty middle schooler’s OC who has no interesting character traits, just a bunch of horrible things happened to them 💀 I say this as someone who was one of those kids
this is old news but its my favorite news ever to hear because it literally makes me laugh every single time like what was he thinking
He could've gotten away with it if he named himself Troy Becker
This sounds like the promotion for Howard the duck. Everyone was asking if Howard was a puppet, an actor in a suit, etc and the directors were like “Howard is a complicated man. He needs a lot of people to help him perform”
I’m not a fan of country music or anything like that but I also can’t believe this is the first I’m hearing of this. Haha you would think more people would have covered this especially your moms house
Danny, don’t lie to us. We know that you are actually the special team of content curators consisting of one guy. His name is robert😊
Everyone thank Robert for his research 🙏
did everyone forget miley cyrus did hannah montana 😂
Garth Brooks is actually a pretty chill and awesome person. I will never forget meeting him in 2001 when my ship pulled in home port after extending our cruise to start OEF cause we were the closest. Friend Travis couldn't leave the mess deck so we told him we would take his ship shirt ue wanted signed and get it for him. Took us a while to convince Garth that our friend's last name was sweetnuts cause it was pretty close to it and we wanted to prank Travis as payback from when we were in Greece and he was drunk as was the rest of us but thought it would be smart to start talking shit about our command master chief and little did we know he was right in fucking front of us in line. Travis looked so happy when we returned then he started reading it and the look of excitement faded so fast and he became really pissed. It wasn't like the day we got home it was a lil while after that when him and Jewel did a nationwide concert on the flight deck of our ship. Jewel was even hotter in person 😂😂. There is at least 2 clips online on YouTube jewel sings 1 named "sängerin jewel mit I'm still standing" and Jewel kilcher singing someday soon" there is some other video/s of the crew setting up for the show. Also I remember when he changed his look too 😂😂 I was like 18-19 when happened. He wasn't fooling anyone 😂😂. We really did think he was going nuts. I don't remember ever hearing about a movie and since I don't like country music at all. I didn't listen to any of the "chris gaines" songs. But between November 10th (day we pulled back in port) and xmas 2001 he was back to his normal self again.
IM SO DEAD this is just this guys OC
Thank you Robert!
Oh dear. (help me get noticed by danny.)
Its giving Roger from American Dad vibes 😂
i mean taylor played 'the man' in the man music video, and the other girl in the ybwm music video and it took us swifts AGES to realise it was actually taylor😭
the length of this video is 17:38
Hi Robert 👋
I need this Chris Gaines and Fox Szn collab more than I need air
i turned on the notifications. can i be truly greg  now?
LOL I remember hearing jokes about this on SNL. I barely knew who Garth Brooks was, but when they showed the side-by-side pictures I was like "yeah of course that's Garth Brooks"
I do remember this. The whole bit about the movie etc is revisionist history. He was trying to be this Chris Gaines character. There was zero connection between the two when that all came out. It failed and now he doesn’t want to look like a choade so they made up that movie
Im just waiting for someone who looks like danny to try and do his debut and everyone's like hi danny! Love your videos! And hes just like ????
Wow fox season was two years ago!?
Chris Gaines looks like Onision soooo cursed lol
This is absurd, considering all the times this creator has been accused of stealing other peoples content and doing underhanded things. I think it’s really gross that he did this video regardless of the content, the thumbnail and implication of what occurred
Garth Brooks is still the most popular country artist in the world.
This video is fetty wap long
danny is a walking toucan
First thing I did when the video started was search through the comments for "YMH" "Segura" "bodies". I was not disappointed. Glad to come across fellow Greg Mommies
When I was finally allowed to watch SNL in my teens, I obsessively watched every single episode (aka wasting 5 years of my life, oof). As a result I have a weirdly specific SNL-based concept of the last ~50 years of American pop culture… and the Garth Brooks/Chris Gaines show is probably the most bizarre of all 900+ episodes (maybe rivaled by Frank Zappa and/or the old lady who won the anyone-can-host contest). When I first saw it ~12 years ago, I was SOOO confused bc they never address that they’re the same person but it was SO obvious. Hands down one of the most secondhand embarrassing events in television history, imo. I’m thrilled it’s finally being explained and talked about hahaha.
What bothers me the most about this is that, this is not rock right ? I expected him to go like full emo alternative rock or smth, not discount U2.
as a project sekai player: Even a person in a game tried releasing music under a new name, SHE WAS FOUND OUT NOT EVEN A YEAR IN(i think a month in?)
So there's a separate billboard list for country, which might be part of the reason that Garth wanted to make this rock and roll album. For a while they were just publicizing Chris Gaines without the Garth Brooks connection. But then ppl figured it out before the album dropped so they put his name on it
I know this isn't the point of the video and that you probably won't read this, but if you do, I have insight into the "what is behind the name Garth" thing. Behind the Name is a website that has a lot of name meanings and popularity charts and histories behind names curated. Google was probably trying to take you to the "Garth" page of that website rather than let you in on a conspiracy theory. Probably.
This video is 17 minutes and 38 seconds long.  17:38, aye
we ❤ robert
Bro really calls himself the number 1 selling artist in US history like Elvis and MJ don’t exist…   He’s also been outsold by Madonna, Taylor Swift, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, and Eminem.
Mariah Carey almost did the same thing! She was gonna release a rock album from the perspective of a goth alter ego. It never got released but she talked about it in her memoir.
IM KIND OF EARLY.
I like how everytime Robert is mentioned, we see a little more of that picture of him they keep using. I feel like we're getting a bit more Robert lore every video despite him only being mentioned.
What we really want to know is where he hid the bodies
Where are the bodies G?
There's actually a bit about this in Family Guy. The episode where Brian and Stewie join the army.
Where the bodies at g?
“Robert” ok Danny
is that not onision
If I had a nickel for everytime Danny exposed a man with a fake double identity I would have two nickels. That's not a lot but it's funny that it happened twice.
Robert has so much power omg
gains just looks like onision
All I can think about is the How I Met Your Mother episode about Robin Sparkles turning into Robin Daggers, and now I wonder if that was based on this situation.
DANNY. IS. GARTH. AND. CHRIS.🗣️‼️🔥😉
Not gonna lie... When I saw the thumbnail I thought "Chris Gaines" was onision...
why does the chris gains music kinda go hard
in regards to that taylor swift comment: jack leopards and the dolphin club
Or maybe Danny was Garth all along…😊
Garth Brooks: the Dream of the 90s.
I think Donny Osmond tried that as well? Off to search the internet, but I swear I remember him trying something like that.
It’s sort of like if Tom Cruise put out music as Stacee Jaxx (even though that’s from a musical, but you get my point).
This was Garth Brook’s edgy, cringy OC with an overly traumatic backstory Also, he looks kinda like Onison
What about the people that have gone missing at his ranch or whatever? Was that Chris too? Lol.
Hi Danny
Danny, please look into the Garth Where are the bodies meme, you may be surprised to know that Garth Brooks is a possible serial killer.
Danny should I join the subreddit?
As someone working in a music store at the time, it was wonderful. No one wanted to buy it, but everyone wanted to hear it. Sadly (happily for the staff) we didn’t get a promo copy. It made for a very entertaining week at work. We had to explain to many people in the 50s what was happening. They still left the store empty handed and confused.😂
Is that onision?
Danny is so tired
i am sooo ready for the Gaines-Sxn collab
his alter ego looks like onision 😭😭😭
paul zimmer core
wait you are born in 1994? you look like you were born 2005 .. wow we do all of the people born in the 199_ look like this 😂
talked about the name garth but failed to mention that his real name is troyal? huge missed opportunity
Robert looks exactly like Dave Franco.
so he basically cosplayed as trent reznor rofffllll
Danny you should watch Taylor Swift's "The Man" music video 😂
Idk how no one has said this yet but Robert looks like a sad, awkward, and unsuccessful Dave Franco
Why does Chris Gains look like Onision?
It was actually just Paul Zimmer before he started Music.ly
2:34 he said barf
I've never even heard about Garth Brooks... but it's probably because I'm European and similar age with Danny
When Chris Gaines was a musical guest on SNL. The cringe was worse than you can imagine.😬
Of fucking course Garth Brooks is Onision
Thanks for the great video, Drew. Nice work, Drew
Walmart Trent Reznor
As someone who remembers this (and listened/listens to garth brooks), but had never known there was supposed to be a movie, i can confirm that we all just thought he lost his mind. Tbh, never thought he ever fully came back from the deep end
Here comes the YMH comments
So what im getting from this is that we are finally getting new ned flames music?
OHH MYYY GOSHHHH?? DANNY POSTED AGAIN?? WOHOHOHO
Damn daddys really been upping his content
Chris Gaines is giving Onision….
i gotta get my daily dose of danny every day 😭
So, not a Garth fan, but Chris Gaines has two songs that are almost bangers - "Unsigned Letter" and "Way of the Girl", the latter is what you hear the opening notes of on the SNL clip. The Gaines' songbook btw is a kind of lost media, because it's not on Spotify and it keeps getting deleted off of YT.  It's funny that Danny brings up Taylor, because this is pretty much what she did in her "Reputation" era, going for a harsh goth (tho still blonde) girl look. There's no way that her then mostly country audience would have accepted "Ready for it?" (with its abrasive opening that's like something out of Yeezus) if she'd released it during her pre-1989 eras - and it remains her most divisive album. Ultimately, what helped Taylor is she had a comfort and fluency in genres outside of country that Brooks lacked - Brooks treats every rock music trope with a straight face, without any flourish or twist, so you end up with songs that are a little impersonal and corny.
For some reason people here in Ireland love garth brooks
Man i hate it sm when my emo photographer is trying to recreate the twilight nightmare wedding
it seems so funny to me that the name Chris Gaines sounds like the typical country singer whereas Garth Brooks sounds like something someone would name their edgy tortured emo deviantart oc
Garth brooks walked so Paul Zimmer could run
Garth Brooks is still insanely insanely popular he sells out pretty much instantly and puts out tons of bs merch that sells out too books and stupid shit. He is very very famous still he never fell off.
chris gaines' made up life has the same energy as the oc you made in middle school with a super tragic backstory so nobody could call them a mary sue.
The thing about Fox Szn that bothers is that Danny didn't try his hardest to disguise himself. He didn't even pitch his voice when singing so it sounded different
Maybe it's just me but I don't think we should call out and identify people when they're trying to be anonymous. Respect privacy.
Article: “…all of which were fictional.”  Danny: “I see, so he *actually* released multiple albums.”
danny: wait so was this a bit? did the other albums exist or didn't they? why's he got so much backstory if this wasn't an attempted identity change me, nodding instantly: oh it was like the plots of the ology books
I actually love his voice ? Like 11:37, proformance is actually kinda nice and I like his voice yall. I can see why this sound was more popular
It’s wild to me that there are people young enough (yet are married with children) who don’t remember the whole Garth Brooks/Chris Gaines era. Pardon me but I must return to my crypt now.
Dude, you never watched Wayne's World before??
Garth is just evil Greg
Aw man. I loved Garth Brooks, but his Chris Gaines arc was so weird! But “Friends in Low Places” goes hard and is my go-to karaoke song.
You mean he’s the original Hannah Montana?
Fun Fact: Childish Gambino would actually do a cover of Lost In You  on Triple J's Like A Version. Chris Gaines as a concept isn't too bad, in fact, I actually have the album on CD & Cassette. I just think it was something a bit *too* ambitious for the time period. I would like to see it somehow make a comeback, especially with how rough music's been lately.
We know what you’re doing.
Its kind of cringe but honestly, i support it. He just wanted to try out something new, different, and creative. It's just art.  He's not really my cup of tea but despite being kind of weird guy he seems like a decent fellow.
Self report
Guys… what is robbert is DANNY⁉️
This is so funny because I just heard this song by an artist called ZWALL and was 80% convinced they were danny with autotune. Danny has literally made the gregs paranoid 😂
0:55 Robert looks like Drew but he doesn't look like Danny-
All Hail Robert the Content Curator! Love this format for the 2nd channel
Is this Danny Gonzalez??? He looks JUST like him. I’m a big fan of him, so it’s sad to see someone using AI to make fake Danny content. I hope Danny sees this channel and takes it down.😡😡😡
6:52 looks like Danny has “the mark of the father”…..baby scratches all over his neck…..either that or he was making new babies you know what i mean😂
Can confirm fans thought he was going nuts. I remember my dad being upset about it lol.
I had forgotten about Garth’s attempt. 😂 Thanks for brining that memory back.
Barf Brooks is right.
For the most famous man in the world I sure don’t know who tf that is. I was legitimately expecting like Michael Jackson or something lmao. Gonna check if his famous with the guy I know thats really into Country  Edit: yeah he’s famous
hey danny gonzales or shoukd i say... garth brookes 🫣
why does chris gaines look like onision. that is the worst alter ego you could have
This is weirdly impressive. I hate country music, I don't know 1 Garth Brooks song, but I respect that he even tried this.
Honestly I’m just waiting for Robert to be revealed as Danny
Why does his alter ego look like Onision?
He’s probably got the highest amount of albums because he doesn’t have his music on Spotify
His disguise looks like an AI Onision
you could even call the movie… A series of unfortunate events
Whoopsie! A little too cringe for little old me!  💨 💃
I hate that I'm old enough to remember this idiocy in full 😅
The disguise looks like Onision
Chris Gaines has strong Onision Vibes
this is like a watered down Andy Kaufman/Tony Cliffton thing
It sounds almost like a Spinal Tap situation, where some people got that it wasn't real and it was just a character but other people didn't pick up on the joke.
I still don't understand why he did it? Like it could be interesting to see what it was like to create a character and write songs from their perspective instead of your own, but he didn't write the music so it's essentially just dressing up
The Chris Gaines song charted on “Top 40” which includes multiple genres, while the Garth Brooks songs charted on Country charts specifically.
I own the Gaines album.
Who up gaining Chrises rn
Just got my wisdom teeth out! Thanks for making me feel better Danny!
Wow Danny 2 is really crankin out the content lately  Edit: on second thought maybe it's just Robert
Fox Szn and Chris Gaines should totally collaborate
For a long time the Billboard Top charts didn't include country.  In fact, Garth was the first to get a number 1 hit.  To this day country still isn't really that incorporated.  There is a long history of country music having it's own awards, charts, sales classes, etc.    The reasons for this would require an essay not fit for a comment section.
Robert is the real hero of this story
Robert has been working overtime lately and we really need to appreciate the effort he does to help Danny on these videos
WHERE ARE THE BODIES GARTH?
I’m old enough to remember this s**tshow firsthand😂 I was absolutely fooled by “Chris Gaines”, but then, I was 17yrs old & not at all a Garth Brooks fan, so I was like “ok seems legit” when I saw his first music vid lol
Green Day did something similar with The Network. They hid their identities and performed under alter egos. Went as far as playing an opening act as The Network to later headline as Green Day lol
this is the first time i’ve ever already known about a topic before danny talks about it
Chris gains is in fact my fave cryptid
Wait he is the top selling artist in the us of all time he has 800k listeners on spotify.....
Green Day is another band that does this kinda thing all the time. They have a ton of side projects outside of their band, sometimes opening for themselves as those bands. Sometimes they disguise themselves, other times they’re open about it. There’s a lot of weird footage out there of it lol

Danny, more like denny 😢
havent even watched the vid yet but i remember seeing fox szn and thinking “when is the video coming out danny?”
Reminds me of Drake Bell rebranding to Latin artist Drake Campana
Danny 3 videos later: "I was Robert this whole time"
How are you so cute
Garth Brooks is a BIG deal in my family and he’s only the only country artist I’ll listen to. He is an AMAZING songwriter. My parents educated me on so many things about him. So when Danny opened up with: Garth Brooks made a fake identity and made music with it. That definitely was not in my archives 😀
Dude was planning the next final destination movie.
Oh my god I remember this when it happened...
There was a really big popstar in Germany in the 90s named Sasha. At the beginning of the 00s, he took a break from his musical career and a few years later a band called "Dick Brave and the backbeats" showed up. They made rockabilly inspired music (completely different from Sasha) and Dick Brave (who had a plausible biography) said he was Canadian and had a thick North American accent when speaking German. He never broke character and would invent stuff when being asked something in interviews.  I think it was never made official that Sasha was Dick Brave and it took years for the public to notice it even though it was rumored for quite a while, but it was funny how much lore they made up for it and how plausible it seemed in the early 00s.
He looks like onision
As someone who was both alive and a huge fan of Garth Brooks fan at this time,  I can confirm that this Chris Gains phase was utterly bizarre.  I actually didn't know this was meant to be connected to a movie and assumed it was some sort of mid life or identity crisis.  But I still love classic Garth Brooks, I can't say much for the Chris Gains music.
Does anyone know the song playing in the background at 3:57 :)  Edit: it also plays here 9:00 :)
Where are the bodies G??
6:08
Maybe Chris Gaines are the friends we made along the way ❤️
i thought the thumbnail was onision on the right
Taylor Swift did wear a wig in the original You Belong with Me music video portraying another character and I didn’t even know it was her for like 10 years
You should check out Tom Rosenthal who created a female Alter Ego Edith Whiskers.
I dont understand, is this your main chanel or something?
Do yourself a favor and look up Tom Segura Garth Brooks Serial Killer .....
"Robert"
"that's his famous song about friends trapped in a well"  absolutely killed me lol.
Thanks Robert!
Chris Gaines kinda has a Y/N vibe about him
childish gambino did a great cover of a chris gaines song lol
Private griffin just for that you have to listen to one track from this chris Gaines album! Don’t you that’s a little extreme? 2 tracks! This is so stupid it’s just Garth brooks In a wig! Just for that you have to listen to every track including the hidden bonus track!
I absolutely LOVED the Chris Gaines album.
Chris Gains looks like a bad Severus Snape cosplay
Danny we all know that this is you and you're using AI to make it seem like this happened in the 90s don't try to fool us.
I was in my early 20s when the Chris Gains thing happened. I actually completely forgot about the so-called movie that was attached to this whole thing until now. That's how little it was ever mentioned. It was absolutely believed that Garth wanted to put out different music and didn't want to do it as Garth. The news was speculating that it was one hell of a mid-life crisis.
2 danny
Tbf I think if someone like Taylor swift did this the fans would probably think its an arg or something I mean didn’t they already theorize that she wrote argyle with literally no basis
As a designated Old Person, I can confirm that back in the day when the internet wasn't as omnipresent the whole "Chris Gaines" thing did confuse and fool some people, but generally people knew it was some kind of Garth Brooks alter-ego thing for a movie once it got into the major news outlets and the newscasters were very wink-wink about it. "We're going to interview Chris Gaines, who we hear is a big fan of Garth Brooks!" I think he may have tried to see if he could legitimately trick people at first, but most people figured it out fairly quick by 1999 standards and his fans were like, "...the hell is this?" When they listened to the album. It was *definitely* pretty widely known by the time he was on SNL.
finally we found out who inspired Troy Becker to do all that crazy shit
Garth is short for Garthfield
Garth brooks is from my state and there’s streets named after him and stuff and I didn’t know any of this
The Chris Gaines persona looks a little too similar to Onisian…
Bro thinks he’s Fox Szn
Chris Gains looks like Onision
So the whole thing is insane. But just to clarify: "Lost In You" is Garth Brooks' only single to chart on the pop charts. He's had tons of hits on the country charts.
mamma mia
Garth is a very weird dude, I've seen some wild documentaries about him and let's just say he's definitely an eccentric; I mean shit, his catch phrase is literally "I like that". 😅 No hate toward him or anyone who enjoys his music, just saying he's definitely a strange man lol.
1999, I was 16. Weird time but this was still even weirder. I wasn't much of a country fan but it was unavoidable. Old fans just pretended this didn't happen.
Garth Brooks cosplaying as Criss Angel 😂
I got a sealed Chris Gaines CD at the thrift store last year but haven’t opened it because I’m scared of it’s evil powers
The article reads like AI
🎉🎉🎉
That's really sweet of you to shout out small artists like fox szn I'm sure he really appreciates it.
かわいいね
We know you are Garth, Danny and we won't let you get away with this
I remember this ! He wasn't trying to fool anyone, and everyone thought it was weird and silly.
I thought Michael Jackson was the top solo music artist of all time.
chris gaines seems like the result of garth brooks getting really into nine inch nails at some point. The whole look of chris gaines looks like its a cheap knockoff of 90s trent reznor
Yay!
I was in college when this happened. I can’t believe I didn’t recognize how weird the 90s were until recently.
The amount of Danny content we've been getting lately makes me happier than i can even describe.       Ive been having Danny, Drew, and Kurtis withdrawls with how little they have been posting for a long time. The weekly holy trinity content era may be over, but Danny's second channel videos are giving me hope, because imo, they are very similar in quality to his classic content, which i actually prefer. I understand Drew and Kurtis wanting to make higher effort content, but i actually prefer the older style of content that left me in stitches on a three times weekly basis.
I now feel like Danny needs to research how the real slim shady became Eminem
I remember this, he was definitely trying to pass this off as real
This is spinal tap
My dad hated Garth brooks so much after this whole Chris Gaines thing that he had me as a lil kid hating him
"Lost In You" is unironically such a serve. It's pure 90's r&b written by babyface. Childish Gambino also did a beautiful cover.
Ong? 2 videos in like 1 month?
Danny, we need another scheme video. Please do another video where your try to fool the audience.
genuinely thought that was a photo of onision
HI ROBERT
What if Greg pretended to be someone else?  Like..."Gerald" or something.  P.S. I've heard of this whole mini-kerfuffle before and it always came across to me like Garth Brooks was really, _really_ jealous of Kurt Cobain for some bizarre reason.
Let me do some critical thinking, Robert the guy he's been bringing up in the videos recently is going to show up out of nowhere, but it will be Danny is disguise and he's going to try and trick us.
I need everyone to know that BEYONCÉ also did this, her persona was called Sasha Fierce
9:31 Danny, do you not remember when the “Look What You Made Me Do” music video dropped?? We were all confused!!!
Robert has been killing it lately.
This video made me feel so old! It was such a baffling thing. I don’t even remember at the time them talking about some movie. He was indeed at the height of his popularity, so it was such a bizarre shift. It was all kinda cringy unless you were a super fan.   I think he wanted to switch gears to another genre of music and wanted to see if his fans would go for it. Clearly, they did not. You can still hear “I’ve got friends in low places” in bars 34 years later.   I had honestly forgotten all about Chris Gaines, much less that absolute drippy saccharine song Lost in You.
I was in highschool at the time. He was extremely popular back then, he wasn't losing traction at all, he just got bored and wanted to be a rock star for a change. We all knew immediately, and roasted him to no end.
"has he ever seen a rockstar? he looks like a cult leader" i meaaaan... Jared Leto comes to mind
I grew up in the most redneck part of Florida, religiously listened to country music my whole childhood and I just called my mom to ask her about why the hell I didn’t know this. The SNL performance is wild lmao
I’m from the same hometown as him. No one really likes him outside of his fame. I did used to live by the Oasis that was mentioned in friends in low places lol. Weird guy.
Barf grook
danny when is the robert reveal
For some reason, I always thought Garth was a type of fish and that’s where he get his name from, but now that I actually think about it for more than 2 seconds, I think I’m getting it confused with “Gar”, which is a type of fish
yEEESSSSS I BEEN WAITING FOR PPL TO WAKE UP AND REMEMBER CHRIS GAINS BC THIS RABBITHOLE IS CRAZYYYYYY
He looks like Tony Wonder
Daniel I forgive you
chris gaines looked like onision in that photo wtf😭
chris gaines is ned flames
Apparently garth is his middle name. His first is Troyal
þank you robert
I knew this
I'm old so i remember this. It was a wild time but I believe most people knew it was Garth and just played along
a few months ago I was at a writing camp where we learned about Chris Gaines and then did an activity where we took genres we didn’t write about and made up a persona who did write those book genres. The counselor said we were “Chris Gaines-ing ourselves”
Thanks Robert
This guy looks so much like onision it's actually melting my brain
the idea of pitchfork giving the chris gaines album ??/10 is hilarious
thank you robert!!
Why is that just Onision 💀
Didn’t he do this like 20 years ago?
My parents went to college with Garth Brooks and they said he always liked rock over country, but since it was Oklahoma State everyone else preferred country so that’s what he’d play. People would roll their eyes when Garth would show up at the party with a guitar and start playing. Jokes on them I guess?
Was this before or after Garth tried to play professional baseball?
There is a conspiracy theory that he's also a serial killer. He has many alters😄
chris gaines sounds like a hunger games oc whos like emo and super op or something, ive never watched the hunger games
PARTY ON GARTH!!!
@5:46 That would've work because everybody knows that Miley Cyrus is actually Lil B.
Lol I’m old so I do actually remember this, I’m glad it’s being rehashed again 😂
To be honest, male country stars have a hard time transitioning into completely different genres without serious scrutiny from insecure male listeners, so I'm sure that had something to do with it
My mom overheard Danny saying he didn't know who Garth Brooks was and now I'm not allowed to watch him anymore. 😂
Not many people know this, but Garth Brooks was actually the inspiration for Hannah Montana
I feel like it would have been more acceptable for him to just admit he wanted to be emo
I'm so old I remember when this happened. Don't get me wrong, I don't listen to country music I just live in Wisconsin 😢
His disguise just looks line Trent Reznor, but the music is Dave Matthews Band at home
I own Chris Gaine's single, "Lost in You." I still listen to it from time to time.
As if GB couldn’t get worse…and then he did.
I’ve just realised that Danny has never seen, and possibly never even heard of the movie Wayne’s World. Otherwise he’d instantly remember Mike Myers yelling ‘party on Garth’ and not be looking it up to find out if it’s even a real name. That film was absolutely inescapable for kids in the 90s, I forget how long ago that was 😂
Yeah, I thought everybody knew about Garth Brooks "alter ego"  (insert :mental break down).
Actual title of the Chris Gaines' biopic: "A series of unfortunate events"
went to a garth brooks concert when i was little, gotta admit it was a good show but the music was.. something
It's really funny how this is considered so wild in the music industry, meanwhile this is a thing that happens all the time with authors xd
This is some cool stuff, slick stuff, neat stuff. I like that! Sure do wish he would tell us where the bodies are - The families need closure, G.
I miss when the second channel was all about drinking LaCroix and getting a bit weird.
robert is your new la croix
chris gains looks like onision wtf 😭🤮
I'm in my 40's, and was (and am) a Garth Brooks fan. I picked up the Chris Gaines album without realizing it was Garth - it was fine, not anything to write home about, but imagine my surprise when I later on figured out they were the same musician lol. Garth was at the height of popularity at that point, and it wasn't that strange to me that he would do this - it felt like Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman - just a way to create something that didn't have to be associated with his name, fame and the stigma of country music (which is a very real thing). It's also a very different sound from his regular music, like Bachman's books felt more violent and "raw" than King's books at the time - I think it gave him a chance to explore music from a different angle than he could as a superstar with a deeply established brand.
A lotta crazy shit went down in ‘99.
is the movie lost media?
he Kida looks like onision
Chris Gaines looks like onision
‘Chris Gaines’ looks like what onision thought he looked like
Paul McCartney has done this a couple times with varying degrees of effort. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Percy Thrillington and The Firemen.   George Harrison did a joking false identity with the credit Harri Georgeson
You're telling me you've never heard of Garth Algar
There's an actual theory that Garth Brooks has AUTISM and it actually explains a lot if it's true
Tbh I think it’s pretty cool, and from what I heard the music is kinda good
Rapunzel Is Bald Now fans when I’m Really Danny fans walk in:
The most shocking thing disclosed in the whole video is that Danny hasn't seen Wayne's World and has not witnessed the best Garth of our time   (No offense other real life Garths. He's the only one I've ever "known")
"It'd be like Hannah Montana releasing a song called 'I'm Miley'." Oh boy, do I have some movie lore for you...
Yo am I the only one who thought the Chris Gaines photo was on*s*on at first 😭😭
Where's the Watcher collab Danny?
POV ❤ its year 2025 and ur listening to Chris Gaines and fox szn’s single
Unironically I listen to Circus on a damn near daily basis. It’s a bop.
where are the bodies G
Chris Gaines and Hannah Montana should have a comeback collab ablum, I am dead serious.
Everyone knew Garth Brooks was Chris Gaines
Give Robert a payrise
Ngl, when I first saw the picture of "Chris Gains" I thought he was Onision
as someone who was around while this all was happening, it was just him having a mid life crisis. Its the same thing as the polly shore is dead, phoenix's im not dead thing. sasha fierce, lady gaga lol, lot of alter egos out there, i think tupac had one back in teh day, humpty. its not new.
Chris Gaines is Hannah Montana  😔
Robert saga continues
the disguise looks like onision
Hahaha I remember when he did this (👵) Everyone was just so confused
Danny’s entire channel is going to become calling out people’s alter egos
Method acting in a healthy way
Roberttttttt..... We love you Robert... Meow meow meow meow meow
7:55 The billboard 100 is a list of the most successful singles (airplay, sales, stream). Garth sold the most albums.
Don't try to fool us, Danny, we know you're secretly Garth Brooks.
thank you once again robert
Like, I know there are plenty of artists who have a persona or character they play to promote an album but this was so strange.
Guys, this might sound crazy, but I think 2 Danny 2 Furious is actually Danny Gonzalez
Chris Gaines = Danny Gonzalez confirmed
robert legit eating all the info up🙏 bless him
I suspect that what confussed so many people about Chris Graines is that his look is so fake and over-the-top that you expect him to be a parody of emo rockstars like Trent Rezor, but his music is genuinenly good so you don't know what's happening. Is Garth Brooks taking the piss or is he just trying to change styles? What's going on?!
I have a theory that Garth Brooks was originally cast for the lead in Rockstar the movie(Mark Wahlberg). They say in pre-production that he was going to be horrible to play Tim "Ripper" Owens of Judas Priest. The times sort of line up taking into consideration pre-pro shooting  post-production and marketing. Chris Cole is the lead characters name pretty close, I dont think Garth thought it would get made since they didnt go forward with him.
Plot twist Danny is both of them and this is his next trick attempt, poor dude can’t get past us
Growing up in the deep south, country music was pretty much required listening growing up. I was actually a huge fan of Garth Brooks when I was a kid. I remember when he did this Chris Gaines thing, I was confused and just tried to pretend it wasn't happening.
Uh...but the best-selling solo artist of all time is Elvis with over a billion albums sold worldwide...
as a french guy, i have absolutely never heard of Garth brooks or his alter ego lol
"Who is Garth Brooks?" I'm still tryna get to know this Robert guy.
Taylor Swift actually did this too. Her and her brother started a band called Jack Leopards and the Dolphin Club
Garth Brooks is really trying to convince us that Danny Gonzales is a real person and not him in disguise (again). Nice try, bucko.
He committed the Chris Gaines bit and thats the performing arts I wanna see
See I don't find it to be a weird thing. Cause authors go by pseudonyms all the time, and some actors don a different persona for their private musical careers.
On the SNL episode, there was a sketch where one of the cast members was talking shit about Chris Gaines to Garth Brooks.  So Garth was definitely playing into the joke on the SNL episode.
thanks Robert!
WE WANT A REDDIT VIDEO
Great video Danny! Would have been funnier if you were aware of the whole Your Mom's House Garth Brooks beef it's hilarious they call him a serial killer all the time to the point where one of their fans brought a sign to one of his concerts that said "WHERE ARE THE BODIES GARTH".
I swear that picture looked like onision
danny youve been my GOAT for like years now
im shocked no one has pointed out how much he ended up looking like onision.
not me rewatching danny’s “i made a viral tiktok song” video today before this
Wow drew you have been uploading a lot more frequently than usual
Well, this isn't so weird that he tried to do that on the peak of his career. Sometimes successful people start to wonder if their recent success is the result of their talent or just because of the name. Stephen King wrote Thinner under an alias, for example
chris gaines looks like onision. i just have to say it
evey wattpad story character background: 14:11 - 14:34  What i'm thinking: 14:41
Oh. Buddy. I lived through 1999. Honestly, I could have told you the story of Chris Gaines with no research required.   Still #CancelKurtisConner #JusticeForGarthBrooks
Honestly he did a better job than Paul Zimmer
the ultimate troll
Country Mindfreak. He looks like BrokeNCyde's youth pastor
Yooooo
Danny mentions Bigfoot a suspicious amount in his videos
Do you think Joaquin Phoenix was inspired by Garth Brooks when he grew a beard and pretended to abandon acting and become a rapper as an stunt for a mockumentary or something?
My parents were huge Garth fans so i vividly recall the Chris Gaines era as a kid and Danny nailed jt- the movie was an after thought. Garth just really thought he could do anything.
Fun fact my cousins had dogs when I was little and one was named Garth and the other was Brooks - rip kings
It is entirely possible to be an incredibly successful artist and not have many hit songs, because charts like Billboard take into account many factors beyond raw album and single sales to determine what constitutes a hit.  Loreena McKennit (think I spelled that right) is one of the most successful artists to have ever lived, but only has one fluke, mostly forgotten hit single because her music is for a very niche audience.
Hannah Montana did this for years and nobody caught her. how do y'all keep failing?
this is so troy becker
🤯
Bro why tf he look like Onision
I never knew that Garth Brooks suffered from a debilitating sex addiction that caused him to seduce and consume every woman around him.
I saw Garth brooks in the preview of this video.  I swear to God, if you do Garth Brooks as dirty as kurtis Conner did, I’ll lose my mind. #CancelKurtisConner #JusticeForGarthBrooks
August is Falling! IYKYK ✌🏼😉
Shout out Robert, a real one.
Allanis Morriset did the same thing back in the 90s. She used to be called "Allanis". She went from singing and dancing in sinc to pop music with a high pitched voice, to naked and guitar strumming with an totally different sound.
Chris Gains walked, so Criss Angel could run...or fly or whatever Criss Angel does.
Anyone else see a lot of similarities to Keith Urban in Chris Gaines bio and look? Lol
I'm gonna say it, I wish that movie had come out unironically if it was done well it could've been a really fun Spinal Tap style spoof
Saw the thumbnail and genuinely thought Chris Gaines was onision
For a while, I would have believed Sia was another pop star in disguise.
I'm kinda old and remember this when it was happening. We all knew who he was from the beginning and he fooled no one
I think garth just wanted to be Chris angel for a lil bit..
It was a failed movie project that he already made the soundtrack for so he released the music without the movie and made a behind the music for it.
That is such old news lol
Losing his friend Tommy in a plane crash is a reference to Tommy Brown the character played by Johnny Cash in an episode of Colombo who crashes his plane to kill his wife and young mistress
Shout out to Robert 🙌
We've now hit the Danny "Did you know about this??" content that makes me feel ancient because... yeah man I was like 10 when this happened.
Are we gonna talk about the fact that his alter ego low key looks like onision??
i am from oklahoma and this was the biggest scandal in my home FOR YEARS
My dumbass thought Tommy Lee went undercover as a country musician
Why does the alter ego look like Onision
Danny is Chris Gaines
me making my edgy rouge halfling for my D&D campaign.
It's giving Paul Zimmer
Covering what jschlatt did in 99 ey danny?
jesus the grab for content is wild.
He looks like if Chris Angel and Shane Dawson had a baby 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀
Thank you Robert
Se finally figured out what "schlatt" did in 1999
Chris Gains giving big Onision vibes.
Never knew Garth Brooks had an emo phase.
Omg yay I love when Robert’s here 🤘🏻🤠
Chris ganes looks like onision 💀
"Cult leaders don't wear shoes" 😂
"Im rEaLLy DaAaaAnYyyYyy"
ngl "Im rEaLLy DaAaaAnYyyYyy" is a bop
Garth Brooks kinda did a reverse Lady Gaga if you think about it.
We love robert
Mid Life Chrisis Gaines.
Ah yes, famous America artist, Gartholomew Brooks.
Chris Gaines was created to distract from Garth's serial killer accusations. We know it was you Garth! The families need closure! Tom was right all along! (Pls google "where are the bodies, G?" for clarification)
Garth Brooks has spoken about his early career in rock n roll and how he eventually got into the country market. Anyways, he didn't even throwback to his roots with this character. I just thought that was weird. Garth Brooks is obviously a quadrangle. You see? He never was a country dude to begin with. A grifter pretending to be a sham pretending to be an emo. Then, whoever he was originally=4. Quadrangle.😊
How is he #1 at 157 mil when MJ sold 500mil?
I wonder if any celebrity has done this and succeeded
Thank goodness Zayden Longzan is covering this topic
Your oldest fan here just chiming in to say yes, this was very much at the height of his fame. He was widely mocked for it at the time and no, ;he wasn't trying to fool anybody. He was trying to do a different kind of music out of the  Country genre, and honestly that album wasn't bad. H:is move was just way before its time  - people were expected to stay in their genre lane. Anyway, feelin' old and sad now....gonna go eat some ice cream.
bros acting like he didnt do the same thing multiple times 💀
5:44 Disney actually released an album called “Meet Miley Cyrus” next to Hannah Montana’s second album
As an elder Greg I remember when this happened. Everyone at the time thought it was lame.
Plot twist: we aren't Greg. Danny was Greg the whole time
I thought that this was another one of those videos where danny acts like someone else
Fun fact, here in brazil we had a guy kinda like that in the 80s if I'm not mistaken. The guy pretended to be a american singer called mark davis. Later in his career he just gave up and just went as fabio junior, admitting he was a Brazilian artist and started to sang in portuguese. In the end he still very famous, and became a star even with this lie 😂😂😂
I'd also like to point out Garth is a MASSIVE liar on his website. "He remains the number #1 selling solo artist in the U.S. history" that's a blatant lie. He is actually closer to the 25th best selling artist of all time. Behind Elvis (500m), Michael Jackson (400m) Elton John (300/250m) Madonna (300/250m) Rihanna (230m) Eminem (220m) Mariah Carey (220m) Taylor Swift (200m) Beyonce (200/160m) Whitney Houston (200m) Celene Dion (200m) Drake (170m) and finally Garth at 170m. And I left out all the bands that vastly outsold him like Led Zepplin, Pink Floyd, and obviously The Beetles.  My guy isn't even the top country artist.
Danny, I am 43 and my daughter and I watch you together.😊 As a teenager during this time in Garth's life, I can tell you that Garth is trying so hard to rewrite history.  At the time, Garth LIVED as Chris Gaines.  Nobody ever mentioned "a movie" back then.  He wore that wig full time and refused to answer to "Garth."  It was confusing because Garth was "method acting" but acting like THE PUBLIC was crazy. The fact that they've rewritten history and lied about this fake movie and "the public wasn't ready..." 😂 We weren't ready to accept Garth selling us Chris Gaines was a real person. That wig must've squeezed his brain too tight! Great video, Danny, my daughter and I love your content! 🎉
bro what 💀💀💀
I can’t figure out if Danny is lying about Robert Schulz who I literally followed before I knew Danny existed😭
Danny, Garth Brooks only performs in stadiums, even recently, he never actually became irrelevant
I actually kinda like the song, but its unavailable on Spotify 😢
cant wait for danny to tell us he's retiring and handing the channel over to ✨robert✨
Clearly this is just Danny Gonzalez in the life of  Fox Season in the life of  Darth Brookes in the life of Chris Gaines… 🧐
Now you need to review the movie, "Wayne's World" - the name Garth was common in pop culture in the 90s because of the SNL skit
Chris Gains reminds me of the main characters on Wattpad…
Thank you Robert you have been carrying the channel recently
don't try and trick us danny we know that robert is actually dave franco
Hi Danny 👋
If I had a nickel for every time a musician tried to completely change his identity I’d have three nickels which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it’s happened three times right
...from the thumbnail i thought it was onision
please get more sleep danny
I dont know who garth brooks or chris gaines is but i do know chip gaines and i was very excited at his mention, second best hgtv show (after the property brothers)
Chris Gained while Garth Lost 😔
“sex that’s the best thing about being a musician” had me dying 😂
Lol Borat was from an earlier SBC show called Da Ali G Show. Wild to think how much in the zeitgeist that type of stuff is now
It's also kind of insane that this dude just chose a style and accidentally went with an early 2010's Onision kind of look, which wasn't even a thing at the time. Like I saw the thumbnail and thought "hold on, we're not seriously still talking about THAT GUY, are we?"
Danny posted, let's gooo!!!
Danny talking like we dont know his alter-ego Drew Gooden
These articles were totally written by AI though... 😭
Robert getting the recognition he deserves
Bring back fox szn :(
he also signed autographs for 23 hours at a country music festival.
my last name is gaines. sorry man, unc forgot his meds.
I remember spending $15 on this CD  back in the day, just so my sister and I could roast it. Garth Brooks has always been a fraud 😂
2 danny 2 robert
i’m starting to think robert isn’t real
Legit thought the guy was Onision in the thumbnail-
I actually bought the Chris Gaines cd as a teen and I was really into it. Probably still have it in my old neglected collection. I still randomly sing Driftin' Away. I was really into the look and legit was crushing on him. I remember being so bummed it didn't really catch on, I was way into the gimmick. The 90s were wild.
If I had a nickel for every time Danny made a video about someone else trying to change their identity, I’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happens twice.
la croix???
you should change your identity so that I don't have to hear your dumb name anymore
Danny, did you read anything about the people that go missing after Garth Brooks concerts? It’s apparently a repeated thing
Lord, I forget how young you are. I graduated high school in 99 and vividly remember this. I was a huge Garth Brooks fan, owned every album, heck, I even bought the Chris Gaines album. I think I still have it in one of those giant zip up CD binders that I never get into anymore because Spotify exists.
HERE WITHIN A HOUR (58 MINUTES )
danny has become a bounty hunter for identity shifting infouencer
tfw a country star pretends to be Criss Angel
danny should make a video reacting to house makeovers gone wrong
i went to a Garth Brooks concert on accident when i was a kid. it was the most boring concert i've ever attended. maybe if he was chris gaines it wouldve been better
Garth Brooks is danny’s secret dad
I thought that was 0nisi0n in the thumbnail at first.
Have you ever heard of Mzekezeke?
I fw his new music 🔥
I have the Chris Gaines cd, it's frankly not that bad, though the back story is crazy. The entire CD booklet (remember those???) have the back story written out, along with album artwork from the many (fake) albums from throughout the fictional career of Chris Gaines.
Garth was also constantly sleeping around. Feels like he wanted to blame Chris Gaines for his whore mongering.
"Yea, it seems like they worked really hard Googling worst things that can happen to you"  Umm... Google wasn't really a thing when they did this.
I thought the picture in the thumbnail was onision and was jumpscared by it
Does anyone know.. yk.. nvm
I can't believe Danny Gonzalez is a detective
Ah, now I see where Chris Angel got his looks.
We know you are hiding the bodies Chris gains
Father Daniel 🙏🏻
Everytime you say Chris gaines i think of the chris james outro music
When I saw the notification for this video I read it and said “was it Danny” and then I saw who posted it and said “oh, was it you” 😭
i can't be the only one that thought that was onision for a hot second lol
Love to see Danny covering the trending timely topics
Okay then, “Danny” we know this isn’t really you and just someone in a Danny disguise. You can’t fool us anymore
I’ve known about this but never deep dived into it lmao.
Why does his alter ego look like onision?😭😭😭
Why does Mr. Brooks look like Onision
is robert dave franco? is this the long con??
Chocolate chip cookies   Ingredients (for 12 cookies)  ½ cup (100 g) sugar ¾ cup (165 g) brown sugar, packed 1 teaspoon salt ½ cup (115 g) unsalted butter, melted 1 egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 ¼ cups (155 g) all-purpose flour ½ teaspoon baking soda 4 oz (110 g) semi-sweet chocolate chunk, or milk chocolate 4 oz (110 g) dark chocolate chunk, or your preference whole milk, to drink, optional  Preparation 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste has formed with no lumps. 2. Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk. 3. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula, being careful not to overmix too much. This will cause the gluten in the flour to toughen which will result in cakier cookies. 4. Fold in the chocolate chunks evenly, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be. 5. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). 6. Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly. 7. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. 8. Cool completely, and serve yourself a glass of milk. 9. Enjoy.
i have a feeling this robert guy isnt even real its just danny
Did the infant maul ur neck
Dannys looking closer and closer like a dad
Wait Danny's 30?? Crazy stuff
I thought this was going to be about that singer that everyone keeps saying sounds like Danny on tiktok 😂😂
I actually remember Chris Gaines. Nobody I know has any recollection of him. I had concluded it was just a weird fever dream.
so now we knw where Onision stole his look
Is Robert real?
Garth brooks is a serial killer. Look it up.
why is he uncovering everybodys alter egos 😭
Party on Wayne! Party on Garth!
52 minut
My grampy's name was Garth, so I guess it was a common country folk name
Honestly I am old enough to remember this and it never made any sense lol. Garth Brooks was still at the top of his game at the time and he took time off to make mediocre record at best. Not a country fan myself but I still felt a bit bad when all of this kind of blew up in his face 😂.
Barth
i think garth brooks predicted mid 2000s pete wentz
COOP AND DANNY IN ONE DAY???
Honestly thought that was Onision! Pmsl
This video makes me want to become a country singing grifter. already got a guitar ready for my country career
It's Lemony Snicket: A Series of Unfortunate Events, but with more sex.
Nah that's clearly onision
Thanks alot Dannny! Now im gonna have to go watch a 43 minute video shot on a potato because i need to know how deep this goes! 😂😂 Great video!
As a fan of Garth Brooks, it's kinda funny to hear the thoughts people have on Chris gaines that have never heard Brooks before, because to me, Gaines isn't nearly as good as Brooks
Oh wait Robert is real?-
Why is Onision a country singer in disguise?
Mariah Carey did something similar! She released a grunge album under "Chick"
Maybe the real Chris Gaines is the friends we made along the way
i loave you danieleeeeb dongalzes//////
7:55 the reason none of his other songs ever hit billboard charts is because they didn’t play on pop radio stations. They were super popular, just not eligible for that specifically.
"i wouldnt call it a coincidence but the fact it happend twice is odd"
I love when two random things I love (Danny and Garth Brooks) come together. 💕
The baby doll falling from the tree 😭😂
bro just turned into onision 💀
So I’m an old Greg so I remember this happening. My memory was “Wait is that Garth? That’s Garth Brooks….are we not supposed to know what’s Garth Brooks? What’s going on?”
Why does the second pic in the thumbnail look like onision?
Garth Brooks was who Roger from American Dad was based on.
When LARPers become musicians
I was a teenager when this happened, he did totally try to trick people but everyone was just like huh what is Garth Brooks doing? And THEN the album name came out. It was so weird.
What a great drew connor video, cant wait for a kurtis johnson and chad gonzales video
this guy is kinda funny
Man, I wonder what Chris *_Gained_* from this...
I am certain Family Guy made a joke about Chris Gaines.
I don’t know why, but something tells me that the likelihood of a Chris Gaines and fox season Collab isn’t zero.
The short answer is that Garth Brooks was supposed to play Chris Gaines in a movie and the album was released as a pre soundtrack to the movie but due to critical reception the movie never got made
Bro literally cosplayed as his OC
Chris Gains is just Garths emo cringey OC
46 minutes ago :)))))))
the alter ego looks like onision lmao
Garth Brooks is one of my parents favorite country artists and they actually saw Garth Brooks in concert back in the 90's in Salt Lake City, and they said that the band had left but Garth stayed and played songs acoustically until around midnight
I think Chris Gaines' album was labeled as fake "greatest hits" record of the artist.
WOOOOO ROBERT!!!! THANK YOU ROBERT!!!!
Danny is Chris Gains
I am a die-hard Garth fan (country music in general) ive never listened to Chris Gaines a day in my life..other than in this video.
When the title and the thumbnail make you lol before you even watch the video RIP Chris Gaines
Danny IS Robert.
I remember that name Chris Gaines i didn't know it was Garth Brooks. I don't like country music never have but know Garth living in Texas everyone expects you to like it but nope. anyway Chris Gaines i have heard that name before i know it
is this just me or was Chris Gaines in the movie zoolander, i've never seen them in the same room before
Me seeing the thumbnail and wondering "Did Danny really just make a video about something that happened when I was in high school?" He sure did.  And yeah, I'm old as hell. I know.
I don't trust anyone named Garth.
The album was also released as Greatest Hits afterwards 😆
Wdym, that's not Danny, that's a real-life musician?? Gonna go listen to his hit-single Avocados and Cheese now :D
That's 5yo danny in disguise
I dunno, I’m just saying we’ve never seen Danny Gonzalez, Garth Brooks, or Chris Gaines in the same room.
I sure hope none of my favourite YouTubers would ever do something like this
Where are bodies G? The families need closure
I’m here for Robert.
I remember when you tried to trick us it was a good video
hey this guy kinda looks like danny!
Admit it, you watched this with your eyes open.
Lmao whats "drew" doing in this vid
I’m from Oklahoma. I grew up on country music so I’m familiar with Garth Brooks. I HAD NO CLUE THIS EVER HAPPENED
I think Danny is up to something with this Robert guy. More consistent 2 Danny 2 Furious all with a mention of Robert. Just a hunch though :)
Tracy Morgan had a great bit on SNL where he talked trash on Chris Gaines to Garth Brooks.
Wow, watching this video, it's like Danny's still here. Fly high king 🕊️
Danny is so lucky he missed the Garth Brooks craze. It was a weird time. And this makes me feel so old because I distinctly remember Chris Gains.
chris gaines’ backstory reads like something a twelve year old would write about their oc
i love you danny
and why does the alter ego look like onision ☹️
Garth Brooks, almost 10 times platinum, world renowned musician, I can't think of a single song he's ever released. You ever feel like the music industry is fake? Like they were the ones that originally came up with the idea of bots inflating numbers, and then the internet just stole that idea years later.
Lunch time. Thanks danny
Imagine Danny just never addressees fox szn
The thumbnail picture of Chris Gains looks so much like onision lmao
Big shout out to Robert
That's not Chris Gaines, that's Criss Angel Mind Freak.
Chris Gaines literally looks like Adam Gontier circa 2006, this is BEYOND parody LMAO
Still not as bad as the drummer from 5FDP starting a new band with his persona, Devil Daddy
Barth Grooks
1 word: YAY❤❤❤
Paul Zimmer 2.0??
I mean he did s pretty good job.....
shout-out to Robert Brooks
We aren't Greg anymore we are Robert!! Lol
My two worlds coming together! Garth IS the king of country (sorryy George Strait) Love the video Danny!!
Garth Brooks recently released an album exclusive to Bass Pro shops. So congratulations to him for continuing to have the weirdest instincts on the planet.
Robert is the true goat here
God damn, way to make me feel old. Did I know this happened? Yes, haha. It was an immediate joke to everyone at the time.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS ONISION IN THE THUMBNAIL 💀
Yay Danny posted
Thank you again, Robert 🫶🏼
Chris Gaines is the original Sasha Fierce
How did Danny get Dave Franco to start collecting vids for him? kinda impressive tbh
Danny’s been putting out so much content! It’s great
i have absolutely no idea what i just watched
17:38??? I’m like hey what’s up Hello 🗣️🗣️
I'm pretty sure this is just chris angel mindfreak.
US GREGS STAN ROBERT
First thumbs down I’m giving a Danny Gonzalez video. How dare you take so many cheap shots at the legend Chris Gaines. I’m so disappointed
Proof that reality is stranger than fiction... and people are even stranger than that.
I have no idea who either of these people are (who this person is?),  but I'll watch it because it's Danny
12:00 This is the life of Flula Borg. love that man
10:07 CHEEKY!
Fun fact Garth Brooks is a serial killer Tom Segura breaks down the whole thing on his YouTube
plis danny i need fox szn back the first song i liked on my spotify was circus and to this day it's a bop
danny's upload schedule somehow got better after being a father..
Who is Robert
always on that manifold grind
Danny keeps talking about people changing their identities because he's secretly Drew Gooden and Kurtis Conner
Here before the copyright claim
Why does Chris Gaines look like Onision
I'm old enough to clearly remember all of this. They did a lot of press releases explaining what he was doing prior to the release of the album, so he definitely wasn't trying to trick anyone. I believe they released the album to see if there was enough interest to drum up funding for the film.
WHAT IS THE SONG THAT PLAYS AT 3:18??? I KNOW IT BUT I CANT REMEMBER THE NAME OR BAND
Hannah Montana did release “Meet Miley” 😂
Your content is taking a real dive and it's kinda sad to see. Way to bring up 20+ year old happenings. Get with it, Danny
Hi Danny !!! 😀
this was just garth's emo phase okay we've all been there
this video made me laugh very hard while i was eating my lunch thank you danny
Never heard garth? have you never seen waynes world?
“How I tricked the internet into thinking i was a singer from the 1900s named Garth Brooks who disguised himself as another singer Chris Gains”
I know a former producer for Garth Brookes who is still friends with him and he speaks really highly of him. I knew literally nothing about him other than that he’s a big country star but the impression I’ve gotten from my friend is nothing like this and I’m so confused 😂
Quick, nobody tell him about Green Day being 5 other different indie bands.
Is nobody ever gonna ask about robert
So Michael Jackson's 900 million albums sold is lower than 157 million, apparently.
why does that alter ego photo look like onision 😭
Oh yes, I remember this well. It was wild!
'Thank you Robert' we all say in unison
danny talking about garth brooks in the year 2024 is the most wild thing i could ever imagine
Im sure that Denny is Robert
I cant believe this actually
Not sure if you want to turn this into a series or not, but you could also look at Stephen King and Richard Bachmann. King did it so much better!
I thought that was Onision in the thumbnail and panicked
Darth Grooks looks like a Final Fantasy character
I just wanted to share this whit someone but i am very stressed beacause i am going to have a competition in athletics and its my chance to go to panevežys to compete so i have to place 1-3rd place and i really hope i will place
Exactly what I need to draw to, thanks Danny
I thought that was onision in the thumbnail lol
i love robert
danny.
What is the song at 3:19?
HI DANNY AND HI GREGGGGG
I love country music and Garth Brooks. But now learning about his alter ego makes me believe the theory that he’s a serial killer even more 😭
honestly i am roberts biggest fan. love you robert keep up the amazing work
Danny doesn't even know about all the bodies Garth has buried along the way. Let the conversation begin...
Name Robert Greg! Name Robert Greg! Name Robert Greg! Name Robert Greg! Name Robert Greg!
Thus gonna turn into a daily upload channel cuz of Robert
shoutout to robert for collecting all the goods once again- we love you robert
i'm convinced that this "robert" character is just danny in disguise... again 🧐
Im loving this 3 video in a month thing
every time I post a cover of one of his songs it's like immediately copyrighted - Garth does not mess around, he might try to take this down 😭
Calling it now, Robert (Robot?) is an AI giving Danny video ideas.
damn robert has really been putting in the work!! hopefully he isn't also secretly you
this was the perfect way to cheer me up after finding out I need spinal surgery
Chris Gaines is just Garth’s dark and edgy OC you can’t not convince me that. The 90s weren’t ready for Gaines, but I think 2024 could be his year
“One guy named Robert” merch when
Damn "Lost in you" is actually kinda lit
Only bots can respond to this comment
is robert a real person.. or is he just a bit…
https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=yBPKdl_YeqE v goood cover
3:00 Danny is that a big red Hickey on your neck? 😅
Robert is working overtime
Danny really thinks we believe Robert is a real person and not just Danny also
Helloo
Hey I grew up near where he lives and used to run into him at the grocery store
who is Robert 😭
i want to know orgin of face on thumbnail so bad
Chris Gaines sounds like an emo Deviantart OC with a very tragic backstory, I'm surprised he's not some sort of angel with eyes that change depending on his mood
I absolutely adore the Chris Gaines album. It's one of my childhood favorites! I have it on CD and keep it in my college dorm because you can't find any of it digitally, and it always lifts my mood. :)
This is like what Danny Glover is doing with HiHi So obnoxious and kinda creepy, but we’ll see what comes of it
If Danny was 5 in 1999, that means he was born in 1994...  Is Danny turning 30 this year?
Its just not the 1830s anymore when you could just  grow a beard and move to ohio and change your name from James custer, to James mackusker. Simpler times.
we love you robert!! 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Seeing Garth Brooks as Chris Gaines gave me an Onion Boy jumpscare. I wasn't prepared for that today so now I'm gonna go lay back down. Jesus Christ...
I love Garth brooks and can’t believe  I didn’t know about this
All these normies only embodying one distinct persona, they're just too afraid to go against the grain!
THIS WEEK IS JUST GETTING BETTER!
Are you sure that’s not just you, Danny? 🤔
Me seeing the thumbnail and thinking some musician was pretending to be onion boy
shoutout to robert 💪💪
I definitely watched the Garth Brooks/Chris Gaines SNL episode when it originally aired 👵🏻
LMAO based on the thumbnail, I definitely thought this was about Onision trying to make country music XD
Guy try’s to pull a Danny and ALSO fails
I think Garth Brooks just had a cool self-insert OC he liked a little too much
Greg.Robert.Grebert.
i actually had learned about this a while ago but cOMPLETELY forgot about it omg it’s so crazy all over again 😂
!
Chris Gaines kind of looks like Onision at first glance so he jumpscared me
WHY DOES HIS ALTER EGO LOOK LIKE DISGRACED YOUTUBER ONISION
Okay, wait, I _am_ confused. Garth wanted to make a movie with this character and while they were making the movie they started concentrating on the character and its music more to the point they didn't even make the movie but that's it? It's just one album with this character and that's it?  Fans got mad because they got confused and that ruined his career?
everyone say thank you robert for being the reason danny can still give us content while spending lots of time with baby greg, we love u robert
honestly, i think nobody would’ve known it was danny if it weren’t for his voice. if Fox SZN had a deeper voice, it could’ve worked.
Way to go Robert we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you
2:20 YOU SAID MY USERNAME YOU SAID MY USERNAME
Danny needs to smoke a bone and get a good few hours in bed, it's like looking in a mirror.
chris gaines's backstory is so fucking funny to me, he's literally every edgy 11 year old's oc
Robert has to be fake. Danny has used this tactic before, and I see right through it. He's doing something.
I subscribed and turned on notifications I AM TRULY GREG
he looks like criss angel lmao
He looks like Onision in his disguise and it’s scaring me
what if 2 danny 2 furious…is actually… Danny Gonzalez!!!!!
14:40 basically the plot of a series of unfortunate events but somehow more messed up 😭
I now fully understand the "from Garth Brooks to Chris Gains" joke Matt Mitchell made. 😄
Friends In Low Places by Garth Brooks < Friends In Low Places by Worthikids
Chris Gaines is the least weird thing about Garth z Brooks believe it or not. Where are the bodies Garth, the families need closure
Thank you robert 👍
Paul Zimmer, Garth Brooks, Danny's own attempts... if YT falls through at least we know Danny can get a job in Witness Protection or espionage XD
Everyone say thanks Robert
9:10 felt like watching a specific Marilyn Manson music video 😂 I’m blanking on the name
Every time I hear the name Garth, my brain is like ✨Garth Vader✨
Wheres the body's, Garth?
I never heard of Garth Brooks and it honestly surprises me
I betchu “Garth” is short for “Hogarth” like from ‘Iron Giant’.  (I have no clue)
and who the hell is this man
Maybe the real Hannah Montana was among the emo friends we’ve made along the way
I gotta be honest, I'm not a big fan of narrating articles for a whole video.
I was so confused when I first clicked on the video bc Chris Gaines looks like Onision in the thumbnail lmao
yay daNNY
Be quiet Danny
Laszlo Cravensworth and a normal human bartender
2 Robert 2 furious
I’m just surprised you haven’t seen Wayne’s world. Most famous Garth in my mind
greg2furious2danny
are we sure its actually was garth brooks and not just a five year old danny? CRITICAL THINKING GUYS!!
The guy just created an OC and ran with it
I need people to understand that Superman/Clark Kent is just fiction. It's not real. People will recognize you with glasses on i promise.
proof that history is doomed to repeat itself
Genuinely who
quadrangle video when?
Childish Gambino made a cover of a Chris Gaines song and it made me obsessed with the song lol.
3:13 so basically tobey macquire’s spiderman
Party on garth
Billie Joe Armstrong. Is also in the network. They have 2 albums. And it’s never really been confirmed that it’s them. But it’s obvious
Who?
As an old lady that was a huge Garth Brooks fan back in the day this was a wild ordeal
11:58 Danny, imagine if you did the same thing when you made your video, just never releasing the video and leaving the audience to wonder why did you made all those weird tiktoks.
are you speaking from experience
Babe wake up Danny just posted >.<
Been watching since the beninging I love your vids
i thought this was gonna be danny doing this again 😭
Hold up. I was raised in Yukon since I was 3. My dad entered a Garth Brooks karaoke contest when I was 6. We all grew up with Garth needless to say. I've never heard of this Chris Gains character though. I am completely baffled. 🤯
Dan Dan dannnnyyyy~~
7:48 Danny has never seen Wayne's World.
it’s literally him😂 what a silly guy thinking he can trick us😂
The Chris Gains project was awesome. I think country music can be so restrictive as a genre (bc of its fans) that he didn’t want to branch out publicly but wanted to explore new music and honestly good for him lol
Danny not knowing Garth Brooks all that well is really funny to me considering I'm from Oklahoma
I love you Robert
The Chris gaines era was insane lol
can we get a robert cam on the top left of every video?
chris gaines looks like onision
How come Robert looks like a Chad version of Drew Gooden?
HE LOOKS LIKE ONISION???
Chris Gaines is scarier than The Blair Witch project...
Why is he sitting in Twilight Sparkle's cutie mark in the lost in you music video
Danny are you ok?
i love chip and jo
Everyone be copying Danny!! It was his idea to pretend to be a different person!!                                                      /j
despite my username i know nothing about garth brooks. thank you for educating me about this absolute lunatic, danny
we are eating good with these second channel uploads
i love garth brooks and i loved chris gaines 😩
Do not cite the deep magic to me, Witch. I was there when it was written.
I’m glad Danny decided to make us all learn about this guy together
Awe Danny it's so nice of you to know I am eating lunch rn, and needed a video to watch!
Philadelphia
Why is Robert Dave Franco?
TIL Danny has never seen Wayne’s World
He’s like Batman
I love how Danny is introducing us to Robert in Every Video 😂
2 danny 2 noticable🙏🏻 he's just him ong
Mmmmmmmmmm
The 90's were truly a decade akin to the grapes of wrath a decade that was the best of times, a decade that was the weirdest of times.
Nice try danny
ur real
Garth brooks will definitely copyright claim this video because he doesn’t even allow his music on YouTube, so I’m glad I’m here early. Haha
oh danny you spoil us with conveniently timed uploads
donald glover covered that song???
Yikes
Thank you Robert. Thank you, Danny
Hannah Montana literally has an album called “Meet Miley Cyrus” and I can’t tell if Danny was making a joke bc he knew this or if he just happened to pick a bad example 😅
I remember this as it was happening IRL I was 17 in 1999 it was a major disaster 😂😂
hi😊
danny is garth brooks confirmed??
this is so awesome. i would do this 100%
This guy inspired Paul Zimmer, even to the point of giving his alter ego a shout out 🤡
Can't wait for Fox Szn's next song
my dad loved the Chris Gaines song right now so I grew up with this as common knowledge, I had no idea it was a rare trinket of information that only I knew
didnt you do this
Hello Danny
Never lose your smile ⚡️⚡️
that’s u what u mean
I love the notion of Garth Brooks and Chip Gaines being the same person
i was watching a bunch of eddy burback videos on autoplay while playing subway surfers and this started playing? new danny video !
You laugh but Brooks has been playing Taylor Swift this whole time!!!
My first concert was Garth Brooks. I unironically like his Chris Gaines album, but people thought he lost the plot because the movie never came out.  What is of note, he didn’t set out to be a country singer. He just got pigeonholed into it because his voice was made for it.  Also, was not his most popular song, just the only song that charted outside of the country charts.
Hello dan the man
HI Danny and robert
The whole “Brooks’ only Top 40 Hit” thing is a function of how the country charts are quarantined from the pop charts to keep all the ‘merica concentrated in one place.
danny i think youre looking too much into thus
Haha I love watching Danny and Drew discover things that everyone older than them just....remembers. #ImNotOldYoureOld
He tried to pull a Hannah Montana
Robert's pretty suckable not going to lie
beans
I’m convinced Danny doesn’t age
4:02 what has Danny been looking for on ebay? Cheese cards and a netal thing with London stamped on it
Robert, back again with heat!
What do you mean you've never heard of the name Garth?! Did you never watch Wayne's World??
The families need closure, G.
When are you admitting to the Mean Girls song on here?
Wenn will Danny finally make a Video about "Drew Gooden" being his alter ego??
As an emo country chick, I approve 🙌🏻
Garth Vader
Robert is iconic
So the main thing I remember from all of this when it happened was that tabloids, yes the fake celeb gossip mags at the supermarket checkout, did a story on Chris Gaines a few months ahead of the actual reveal, but everyone dismissed it as yet another one of the crappy photoshop jobs from a tabloid. Cause of course you look at it and laugh at how ridiculous it is and then... oh.
robert is so cool
Love Garth Brooks tbh. Anyway in 99 the music videos were kinda like that
Danny Upload? Uh hell yeah
I was there, man. We all knew..... we just liked Garth enough that we started calling him Chris and smiled and nodded......🤷‍♀️
Dannnn
literally just watched the paul zimmer / troy becker videos lol
I’ve literally never been this early in my life
gerg?
i think this robert guy that danny keeps name dropping everyday it’s not just a funny bit but a long running experiment that someday will make us all subconsciously be more keen to roberts in general.  i’m looking at you future danny 👁️ 👁️
Before 10 Minutes gang
Uploaded just in time for lunch. Bless up 🙏🏼🙌🏼
I got to live through this in real time and it was even funnier. Family Guy even got a bit in, like, a decade and a half later.
Good video Danny 👍
Nice try Danny, we know this is you
Because of the name this channel should have 2 Danny's😂
cmon danny, don’t act like you aren’t just reading up on the tips and tricks
welcome to country music lore bestie
Great video
I hate it when my wedding photographers try to shoot my wedding like Schindler's List.
Green Day also did it as the Foxboro Hot Tubs.
Damn Danny. I was gonna go to sleep, but now I gotta watch this video. Thanks for ruining my sleep schedule.
Danny...u at it again
i love girth books i hope he doesnt have any alter egos
"I spent last night in the arms of a girl in Louisiana And though I'm out on the highway My thoughts are still with her..." 🎶 🎶
But there was a song released cuz I remember listening to it that's crazy I never knew that...sooo weird.
okay danny
It’s good to have a Robert in your life
Robert strikes again
dammy gomzalez
Robert has really been carrying these last few vids.
“We have to figure out what happened in 1999” Danny, I think you should reach out to Mr Jschlatt, he will be able to help.
Chris Gaines? Gains what? Chris Gaines deez nuts in his mouth?  We'll never know
beep beep
danny may not deliver, but he never fails to be pregnant 🔥🗣️🙏
real
ok this is getting out of hand what is going on with robert where are you keeping him danny
Garth Brooks is one of the biggest artists of all time 😆
Im 40 and loved Garth Brooks growing up, and my jaw is on the floor 😂 I had no idea!
When will this “Robert” just take over the channel
We know it’s you Danny you can’t fool us
guys don’t listen to his tricks. this is just a hoax. #garthbrooksisdannygonzalez #wemustescapethematrix
uploaded just in time for me to watch this on my lunch break 😌
Garth Brooks Is actually two Danny's in a trench coat
Shame on Danny for not being a country Stan at the ripe age of 5
Everyone say Thank you Robertttttt
Danny never fails to lobotomise us ❤
Honestly I was living that Garth Brooks and Chris Gains double aesthetic as a teen because of my love of being dramatically emo conflicting with my Christian parents. Chris Gains at school, Garth Brooks at church.
shoutout to robert! 🎉
I think Danny is going to do change identify again 😅He is always good at this job 👌 2 Danny 2 Greg 👥👥
yaay a video
You're kidding me.... I remember hearing about this guy... I did not know that this was the country singer that's insane... The internet was not everywhere quite yet done so I remember seeing the CD cover and everything you wouldn't have known unless you saw an interview that that was the same person He looks very different in the photo That is so creepy and weird...and crazy
Danny: I've actually been Garth Brooks this whole time.
Hey Danny 😊 luv ur vids
we <3 u robert
DANNY FAILED TO MAKE ME PREGNANT. WHAT DO I DO
i was wondering how did i miss this random video by danny when i watched through all of them and even rewatched some and then realised it was posted 4 minutes ago
Fox Season's brother who was separated at birth.
bro pretends aGain to be someone else smh
Thank you Danny for my daily one laughter
You lied Danny. I knew about this back in 1999. You did not learn about this at the same time as me.
isn’t this whole concept just hannah montana?

Dannys been pumping out content like he tryna win a thrusting race
thank you danny, just in time for lunch

Wow 2 minutes! I've never been here so early!
i love being gregnant with dannys child
My grandma is OBSESSED with Garth brooks. I never got into any of his songs. This is so fascinating. Also , I’m emo and that hair that his alter ego has is CRAZY similar to some people in the scene.
Thanks Robert!
Danny knew I was having a little snack and needed something to watch, so he uploaded this just for me🤞🥰
