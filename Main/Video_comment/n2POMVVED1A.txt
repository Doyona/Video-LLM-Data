I've had a full english breakfast, and it's fantastic.
I can't watch this video any more because of the terfs in the comments
not burnt enough
just wrong off the bat . insane
Looks better than restaurant food
How many wankers! So little time
This looks delicious, definitely going to try it
I actually tried the game a few months ago and it was awesome!
Putting cabbage in with potatoes 🤮
I am allergic to potatoes so none for me but I will eat everything else
Breakfast? Bro I don't think I'd be hungry for the rest of the day if I eat that.
What a cracking recipe. Thanks for sharing!
Full English breakfast is better than full American breakfast. I'm American but I will die on this hill.'
A) No one in England ever eats a full English breakfast. It’s just for tourists. B) if they did, they certainly wouldn’t eat over easy eggs and cherry tomatoes. Babish, once again you’ve got it wrong. A full English breakfast in California. Ridiculous.
I can’t stand the music
I'll never understand my fellow Americans' desire for what is essentially dessert for breakfast. England, y'all got it right 👌
first time I've ever heard about bubble and squeak in full fry-up?
We only have bubble and squeak on boxing day usually, but it was originally made with "leftover" brussel sprouts in my family, not cabbage
Its been 2 years and people still get triggered by a food making video. 😂😂😂   Don't get me wrong, i think harry potter is insanely overrated and has plot holes but c'mon no need to get so butthurt over someone supporting a series
About half the stuff in a full English breakfast I wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole.  Not a fan of mushrooms, blood sausage, eggs over easy or barely-seared tomatoes.
American make an actually authentic English breakfast IMPOSSIBLE CHALLENGE
English people won’t shame you for your cooking like Italians will. We just appreciate you saying nice things about it
I am American and I love how many angry British people you have attracted by making this video, but it all looks very delicious
Both are wrong! The U.S. one sounds disgusting.
Just a thought, combine the two? I want a transatlantic gut-buster please.
hogwarts legacy continues to be a mid game stained by the shadow of a deranged woman and this video continues to be stained by both that and also that the food is awful.
Nope. That that wasn't fried bread I'd make personally I just fry it in a pan of  vegetable oil
what’s that long flat utensil used at 3:14?
You lost me at bubble and squeak patties.
Sorry English breakfast is DISGUSTING
yes
mmmmm, promoting J K Rowling's TERF-O-Verse
how is this not botched?
bubble and sqeak no and you didn't pierce the sausages with a fork also eggs are sunny side up not flipped, Major mistakes :_
what silly c*** told you bubble and squeak is part of a full english? And how silly you were, believin' em
Bruh the "canadian" english breakfast takes like 20 years to make according to you
6:01 song name please 😢 desperately needs it🫡
man, i do love me some complete british desayuno.
I’m impressed on how quickly he got those potatoes, ready and minced
"Start by making what is hopefully a pretty authentic Full English breakfast and that starts with the delightful named Bubble and Squeak'. In a Full English?
I’ll stick to my full Irish breakfast thank you 😊
This is great if you have time to make this for breakfast. Ironically, I write this as I watch a Harry Potter movie.😏
If taxation without representation is enough to fight a war for independence, so too is a traditional English breakfast.
Love how you immediately go wrong with bubble and squeak. It's British for sure, but I've never had or heard of anyone having that with breakfast
Canola oil is the worst thing for your heart. Stop using it.
it's called black pudding not 'blood sausage'
this is the most over the top instruction of a fry up hahaha
That full platter is just for one?
Treat breakfast like a king, but you eat peasant food. No wonder the Chinese, who eat dim sum, are becoming the second superpower in the economy."
With all due respect, you have no idea how to make english hashbrowns.
how ridiculous that you clean up the potatoes from its natiral starch bit lazer on you ad powder starch from a package in order to make hash browns.
You tried to bot this babish, but still the trans tears flow.
What Mrs. Bucket used to make all the time.
oh hey you deleted that other sponsorship! I check in every once in a while because I used to love your videos. But until you acknowledge this, at all, I'll never feel safe watching your content. Let the replies to this comment show you why.
Suprising amount of bots saying amazing. Wouldn't be suprised of most of the likes being bought.
JKR's rhetoric got a 16 year old trans british girl stabbed to death. Anyone who supports JKR or Harry Potter is giving money to a killer. Babish is paying bots to fill these comments with positive things.
So whatever your feelings about his decision to do the ad, either pro or con, I think we can confirm it was a mistake.  January 2023 Babish celebrated 10 million subscribers, and would commonly get millions of views  It’s now May 2024 and he has 10.2 Million, his viewerships are lucky to break a million. His monthly views are 2/3rds what they were.
oh nice unsubbed
Truly disappointing, dude. Really.
Let's see if you can make pie and mash from London.
I was just trying to watch this video and I get an ad with this man😂
Ignore all the other English people telling you bubble and squeak doesn't go in a full English. It's not common these days, but it's an acceptable option, and I for one prefer it. Feel free to quote me as an authoritative source if this comes up again.
you did well lol
that is not fried bread
Pleasantly surprised I haven't seen any apology or groveling from the team.  All for showing support to a cause you believe in, but once it boils down to a harassment campaign for people who either aren't aware or don't care...that's where you lose me
There's so many bots
Looks delicious, however most Americans do not eat that style of hashbrowns.  Usually not made into a pattie.  Also, the American breakfast would also include American biscuits and sausage gravy, bit the food presented looks wonderful!
I’m so glad the comments from insane people have been deleted
Not a bad attempt
Sponsored by Hogwarts legacy at this time??? Lol no.
Ovular he says.
What brand of griddle does Babish use in this video?
This is the 3rd food creator with this Exact sponsorship
Looking at these comments, is babish buying comments? Because it really looks like it

No need for hash browns they aren't real food, same for bubble and squeak.....ditch both and double up bacon and sausage

That American breakfast is essentially the perfect hangover breakfast.
Sellout terf
Sellout
I now wanna buy Hogwarts legacy 10x every year
Jesus Christ why tf has he fried the eggs upside down.
The decision to take a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy was kind of dicey tbh, I think I’m going to look for a different recipe
taking rowling's money but still jacking it to trans women. yeah, that tracks.
I guess (p)redditors left the comment sections and retreated to their gooncaves.
The less authentic, the more a compliment. The original recipe is nothing special.
You should NEVER compare an American breakfast with a British breakfast. British is better.
Nah no one has bubble and squeak on a full english
This is fake.. they dont season
Talos?
That’s isn’t a full English
tasty
Bubble and squeak was the traditional part years ago. Hash browns are now used cos lazy sods can't be arsed. Also fried bread fried in lard. Toast was a side.

Awesome video
fried bread? could you not just do toast, also, fried eggs aren't flipped, also that bacon needed so much longer
See ya Karen
yep hashbrowns instad and ya missed out the tined tamtos swell also toast as well as frys brea nd ya need the tea aswell now i wnt a full english lol :)
I’d like a word with whoever consulted about the food on this…
As a naturalized British citizen who has lived here for 7 years, I have never seen bubble and squeak. Either on its own or as part of a full English. Wasn’t even on the Life in the UK test which has the Ulster fry for instance.
Canadian bacon is HAM! Why in the states is it called that!? Infuriating!
I thought "blood sausage" (black pudding what we call it) was part of a full Irish very little different between the two I had the understanding that blood sausage was Irish and the hash brown was English
Glad to see reddit slowly leaving the comment section
Disappointed in you, but eh.
Full english is amazing! I swear I've seen Hash Brown's here more than Bubble and Squeak so I imagine either work fine. I love both options a lot regardless.
It must be said.  The Basics With Babish soundtrack, songtrack, track is ICONIC.  I am just blanketed with peace and comfort each time I hear it start off in the background before the screen cuts to the actual video - like Babish - my heart... they're happy! 😭
I now share the pain the Italians feel when you attempt their cooking. We expect an apology video, featuring Gordon Ramsay, in due course.
A full English is something I'll treat myself to maybe once every couple of months, my dad would have one most Saturdays and when he would make me a small version it made me feel like I was becoming a man :)
just lost a sub…. i hope cultivating a crowd of transphobes is worth it
Blood sausage.  Think I'll pass.
Great sponsor, but I'm afraid I can't support British people. Super disappointing.
Bit of a bad step there Babby me lad.
[stares in British] OK no.
Is nobody gonna mention the fact he flipped those eggs!?? I am disgusted
hmmmm...close. hash browns needed though and real black pudding!
I'm an indonesian but i like this kind of breakfast.
The full English breakfast is and will always be the undefeated champion of breakfast
I thought this came out years ago
I get still having the sponsor in the video. I may not support jkr but i will support one of my favorite food youtubers always.
Glad to see that you got such a major sponsor from a big company.
I'd just go for a normal sausage instead of those crumby little things just beef or pork would do or even a mix
A full English is also considered a suicide attempt
you need proper Bury black pudding on there, that blood sausage you're using doesn't look nearly dark enough. Also ditch the bubble and squeak, it's a very rare inclusion
Hash browns, and black pudding, tea, Juice. however you like!
Looking at the newest comments is giving me brainrot but i can't stop please help
just wanted to say i really sincerely do love your content and i have loved it for a while but i don't appreciate how you handled this sponsorship or the aftermath of it. this is apparent in the comments-- i've literally never seen more bigotry in a BWB comments section. i hate to say it but you have made bigots feel safe on your channel, which i don't want to support. sorry babish.
Why are the fake trans allies still commenting a month after this video went up? You guys lost just stop, Hogwarts Legacy is the best selling game this year and nothing you guys say or do will stop it at this point.
I liked food until you endorsed a video game. Now I hate food.
You all ever notice none of these genital mutilation advocates respond to their replies?
“Please remove the sponsor”. Nah 😂
Long time viewer here. I am disappointed to see you took the Hogwarts sponsorship, honestly. I understand that a lot of people are completely in the dark about the objectively bad things that JKR has done (Associate with terfs that are actively harming trans people by funding anti trans legislation; funding it herself; using her platform to overly criticize trans people who have done nothing to her, therefore sending hate mobs to these trans people to send extreme criticism, threats, and bullying; ignoring that specific harm she has done and passes it off as them being sensitive; buying a women's shelter for the sole purpose of banning trans women from it; and using the popularity of this game to validate her beliefs that everyone doing such supports her political views), so I just wanted to let you know. Even if you personally do not like her, or believe what she believes, she will use you as her sword to hurt us. Please don't let her get away with it
Please get rid of this sponsor. This game made by is transphobic and antisemitic people. You changed the name but still have the sponsor, this is wrong.
I remember subscribing to you when you released your very first BwB video. I avidly watched and recommended your videos to everyone I knew for years. I fell off the schedule a while back, but I was incredibly disappointed to find this video, to find that you would be willing to accept a sponsorship from people who actively promote transphobia and bigotry.
Disappointed that you seem to be promoting a series that has a transphobic creator and itself promotes a lot of anti-semitism and racism in general...  And then noting that you're deleting most of the comments that call you out on it, real classy.
No.  Bubble an squeak is what you have for breakfast on Monday morning after a roastie.  It absolutely DOES NOT belong on a Full English.  It's left-over roast potatoes and any left-over veg, mixed together and fried in one big pancake.  It's called Bubble and Squeak because whilst frying, it bubbles and squeaks.
The eggs being upside down unnerves me 😂
Been a fan for a really long time, but I guess I’m unsubscribing now. There’s no excuse for promoting such a transphobic and antisemitic game. Disappointed and heartbroken.
Bubble and squeak is a separate meal. We don't have it on a full English. They being said you could but its usually a hash brown or rossti
Use savoy cabbage in future, not white cabbage. Bubble & Squeak should be colourful
Well, it's time for him to do another episode where he apologizes to Canadians.  That's not Canadian bacon my dude. That's just ham.  Canadian bacon is also known as peameal bacon and is very different to what you had on this episode.
very disappointed that this is the side you took by accepting this sponsorship.
Been subscribed for years but honestly I can no longer support this channel if you’re going to be sponsoring bigots. I wish you well in your future endeavors.
Babish why did you do this?????? I hate the br*ts and you should too
The correct name for this is a Cooked Breakfast.
bro got sponsored for gaming while cooking  💀
I expected better from you...sad
Englishman here. The secret ingredient is being hungover. Other than that it looked very nice!
Great recipe, but usually the fried bread is fried in the left over bacon grease; super healthy.
Love the video and the game! For anyone who likes Harry Potter or even just open world rpgs, it's actually a better game than I expected with all the advertising. Maybe wait until the game gets a bit cheaper though lol.  Also, I will definitely be eating an English Breakfast whilst playing for the sake of extra immersion, so this video came in handy.
I used to love watching your videos but after getting flashed with bigotry from that sponsorship I have finally seen the real you. This game is fueling concentration camps for the transgender I cannot believe you I thought you were a decent cis hetero man but no  you are becoming a dictator that will negatively effect the trans allies!!!!!
babish terf embarrassment
Yikes. Is an ad really more important than solidarity with trans people?
I love the Hogwarts game! I couldn’t believe that Fig dies in both endings and Rookwood was the one who cursed Ann!
As a Canadian That is not Canadian bacon That is just ham
just wanna say fried bread is deep fried !
I’m off that wicked wizard dark evil pack 🍃🍃🧙‍♂️🪄
Excellent
If I had the time I'd like to make breakfast more often. One thing I enjoy is hashbrowns (sometimes fries if I have them) with lots bacon or sausage 2 over easy eggs in a large bowl with cheese and white gravy. Obviously this is am incredibly heavy meal so I suggest salad for lunch and a lot of veggies with dinner.
Oh mate. It was going so well then you flipped the eggs and didn't have HP sauce. You still get a 7/10 but it was heading for 9.
Would LOVE to see a vegetarian take on this, apologies in advance if that is heretical! Thanks, Babish, love the videos!
I can’t believe you would align yourself and take money from literal nazis. You went from someone I really enjoyed watching on YouTube to someone who when you die I will make fun of people mourning your death. Sorry but that’s the choice you made.
Its hash browns for a full English.  Also black pudding is different to blood sausages. If this is your take on a English fry please don't do an Irish fry up.  Bubble and squeak is using left over mash.   No hate xx
Oh no no no, a full English does NOT have cabbage in it. Jesus christ almighty, what are you doing fella!?!?! Bleedin heresy, this.
13k dislikes, wow you guys are really goin to town
that’s not back bacon, THATS YA BACK BAKING!
Real brave of you babish for the sponsor. Respect to you tho
Id probably make this just no mushrooms, I dont like mushrooms
I have sat on this for several days, but as the mother of a transgender child I can no longer support a channel that accepts sponsorships that enrich such a vocal transphobe. The language and beliefs you have chosen to support endanger my child. In addition, you or someone from your staff highlighted a bullying comment made to me in another thread. I will no longer support your work with my views. A trans woman was beaten just a few miles from my house last week. The rhetoric you are supporting encourages this kind of behavior. I hope you will reconsider.
Now THIS is the full English I remember not that family guy clone
Babish I love you, but opening with saying you're making a "pretty authentic" full English - then proceeding to make Bubble & Squeak is hilarious.  Literally never had it on any full English I've had
Homeboy out here promoting hogwarts legacy… controversial
Gotta be honest, it's disappointing to see you take their money and advertise this game. Like, you're usually so supportive and wholesome, it stings to see you promoting something owned by such a rabid transphobe.
Here to support the guy that up'd my soup game. Keep on Rollin !!
If you liked the black sausage (or “pudding” as it’s often called), you should try white pudding as well!
great sponsor
supporting JK Rowling is supporting transphobia. disappointed.
Wow! this breakfast looks amazing! 😍. Looks like the perfect breakfast to help get me through the Wizarding world! Great job!
as always, people use the opportunity of trans people doing something questionable to be blatantly hateful towards them. jesus christ, can you grow up and accept people for who they are
Shame your fried bread is wrong. No one makes it like that
i like how out of all the ppl that played hogwarts legacy, the predittors chose to attack babish for no reason, actually mentally ill people
BET YOU COULDN’T DO A FULL AUTHENTIC SCOTTISH BREAKFAST
Great video!
Genuinely never seen bubble and squeak in a full english. Its always served with tea not breakfast.
I wasn't interested in Hogwarts Legacy but Babish's sexy, deep voice completely sold me on it! Thanks bro
super disappointing, man. ngl
This looks fantastic. But flipping the eggs? Nah. Oh and I'm a southerner, I won't touch black pudding. Major props for doing fried bread instead of toast though! And the bubble and squeak was a nice touch.
Babish I am very disappointed in your choice of sponsorship. Hogwarts Legacy is British propaganda.
great vid, terrible sponsor
Liking and commenting to keep the trolls away lol. Keep on doing your great content.
I have the deluxe edition
Yummy ❤
The idea people were attacking Babish over this, makes me want to buy hogwarts legacy. The idiots are making people have the opposite reaction
What’s the British version of Waffle House?
13k losers crying lol
Babish just whipping out another absolute master piece
This drama started with a SINGLE SPONSOR ON THIS VID!!! Why didn't you go after others playing it? Is it because he's popular?
Oh this is very much a miss on a Full English.
i like how all these fake fans come out of the wood work to slander a man who advertised a children’s game. lunacy and mental illness.
Fire game glad to see a sponsorship from WBG.
Wizard game makes Twitter spergs cry and seethe.
The sponsor…. 😟
Isn't fried bread supposed to be deepfried?
Full English. Can’t beat it. It’s my favorite food.
Shame on you for taking the bigot money.
looks amazing!! can't wait to try it
Weird I haven’t seen a single negative comment about the obvious  Guess I haven’t looked hard enough
Came here because I heard about the ridiculous Harry Potter article. Liked and subbed, thanks for the great content
Dont flip the eggs babish noooooooo!!!! And hashbrowns are more common so 🎉
Raise your hands: who's here to spite those losers (especially that one Twitter user) who somehow thinks our cooking Mr. Rogers is now bad over the sponsor?  And if you somehow think this means Andrew is now a bad person, you need to get off the internet for like a week :).
cringe harry potter ad
First one looked better to me
Kosher salt is the jew of all salts
I’m sorry but this isn’t what Canadian Bacon looks like, this looks like some super C garbage in the jambon aisle.
We definitely use hash browns instead of bubble and squeak. Also, blood sausage and black pudding are not the same thing. You need to get hold of some Bury Black Pudding and give that a try. Absolute game changer.
Great video. Keep them coming man! There is nothing more comforting on a cold morning than a Full English <3
pretty accurate to be fair. i'd probably go for hash browns over bubble and squeak though!
disappointed in the sponsorship. i get it's just a wizard game to a lot of people but the money still goes to a hateful person regardless of the content. ik andrew is better than this and that saddens me
I'm sorry but this is complete and utter betrayal. Enjoy your gross transphobe money.
Not crushing on the face-hiding -- feels like you're workings toward pulling the ol' switcheroo on your audience, so you can substitute your henchlings, but it's just not the same.  Agreed, you deserve a break, but perhaps consider introducing your substitutes more tactfully, less deceptively.
We english never flip our eggs. Sunny is the only acceptable up side.
Sausage is anemic
Mate we don't flip our eggs. Sunny side up, as you chaps over the pond say.
I am here to support this youtuber I never heard of until 5 minutes ago lol
Don't let these bullies try and "cancel" you, Babs. Keep doing what you do best!
Don't endorse terfs...
Not very cool to take the ad money
UNsubscribing. Utterly awful of you to take this sponsorship.
Hogwarts legacy is a sham and supports transphobic rhetoric and the queen terf herself
*ensures adblocker is on for this one* sorry babs.... no hogwarts support from me.   wont stop me from buying an apron though
All it really took was money for you to sell out? Cool. This transgender man won't be giving you watch minutes.
Bubble and squeak is made with left overs. Never usually made like this.
In the history of life, nobody has ever done whole cherry tomatoes on the vine, even posh people! Proper tomatoes, in half, nicely cooked down. Shocking
The eggs, tomato, hash browns and toast from the American breakfast are closer to what's normal in the UK
It’s sad to see you sacrifice your trans fans in favor of these alt right trolls. Never saw so much antisemitism and transphobia in your comment sections before this. This was a mistake and you need to own up to it. Until then I’m unsubscribed.
Clinically online twitter users on their way to lose their balls over a video about English breakfast because of a 10-second clip of a wizard game.
Yummy food 😋
why support transphobe legacy?
The transphobia in these comment sections is exactly why you don't promote something a transphobic pos makes money off of. It's not some huge egregious thing he did but just really tone def. But hey when you sell out and have 10m+ subs you're pretty untouchable
Seeing those hash browns get golden was the ultimate satisfaction
Maybe you should create a BLT sandwich next time, with a rainbow flag on top as garnish.
Hey! Just stopping by to say as a long time fan from when you’d post your early videos on Reddit, as well as hanging out at your book signing years ago, I had to unsub and won’t be supporting any more of your endeavors because of this brand integration. Best of luck to you in the future
Looks super delicious 😋
The inaccuracy is quite impressive in it's own way 😂
Fan for a while, really enjoy the BCU and all you've done with the channel, but I'm really bummed to see you supporting a game that has so much hate in and behind it. Not sure if I can stick around because of that.
No one in the uk eats cabbage with their breakfast, just classic hash browns even we go to maccas for that
UK wins.
Joanne explicitly stated that she will be giving all her royalties from this game to an antitrans organization... By taking this sponsorship and thus encouraging people to play it, you are directing people's money that direction... Very disappointing.
Why did you take this sponsorship? You're a major content creator, there's no way you haven't heard about all of the controversy surrounding JKR being transphobic. I've seen you build an entire channel and subscriber base that tries to be accepting, so once again, why would you accept this sponsorship? I guess money and views are more valuable than critically thinking about how this would affect trans folks, giving JKR more money by pushing this game out to more folks. Ugh.
Goodbye, Babish.
Alphabet gang going nuts up in here lol 😂
Stop making our food palatable, we like it how it is.
You don't bubble and squeak with a full English. And also, being English. A fry up version of a full English is so much better than what you made.
Imagine getting triggered over a Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship.
lol yeah that Harry Potter ad got you a lot of dislikes.  People are too easily offended today.  Ignore the ad and like the video for everything else it does.
Sorry .... no ..... 👎
Kinda disappointed that there were no references to bangers in the mouth
Hogwarts is in Scotland. Should be a full Scottish breakfast.
Our sausages can very. Sometimes we have breakfast but i also like cumberlands because im a menace. Also heaps of daddy sauce is the condiment of choice for the older generations full english
I don't know why people rag on British cuisine when it has breakfasts THIS full on.
Dislike. No toast sandwich.
Yer a wizard, Babish.
You are sponsered by HOGWARTS A LEGACYY!!! Two favorite things joined together!!
Can't believe you sold out, man. This sucks.
Love your videos and even attempt to make some of them. A request. Could you make the Cannoli from season 2 of Your Honor?
Disappointed in the ad, BCU. Ciao.
Just awful all round.
Yikes
Yikes
Based babish
Yikes on bikes what a poor choice of sponsor.
Well that’s deeply disappointing.
Is this a joke?
Bubble and Squeak in a Full English?! Dear me…
You didn't need to shill for jk rowling man, extremely disappointing.
i still can't believe there's no public apology for eating british food on camera. dreadful
Bubble and Squeak is different in the UK.. in wales it’s your Sunday roast all mashed down into an lumps and clumps (so the chicken, potatoes, veg etc all crushed up) and then added an egg and mix and fry like an omelet. It’s lovely, specially with the crispy and soft parts. I put some ketchup on the side and it just adds to the flavour. You can do some salt and pepper too if wanted.   Also you cooked the tomatoes weirdly. The second way you done the tomatoe is correct and how it’s done here.
Man there are some crazies in this comment section (even more so than normal). Great episode, great game, no hate in either.
I do appreciate the little touch of using proper Celsius for the British version, and Fahrenheit shenanigans for the Freedumb version.
unfollowing because you accepted payment to promote that game! not interested in anybody who aids and abets the platforming of one of the world's most vocal transphobes
I am so beyond disappointed you would take money to shill for Blood Libel the video game.
Disappointed at this partnership
Honestly, seeing the unnecessary hate from all these people who havent really done any research and jumped on a hate train really disappoints me. I found this video to be delightful, and the sponsorship was from a game that was made without any input from JK anyway Unbelievable. Keep up the great videos, Babish!
JKR is a transphobe. The video game uses a ton of antisemitic stereotypes and conspiracy theories as its plot. Please don't take money from these people.
Finding out you hated trans folks this whole time is mind blowing.
10 tomatoes 🤣
Why are you cooking your sausages while they're still linked? 😂
Probably already mentioned, but hash browns are perfectly acceptable on a full English, probably even more common than bubble and squeak, which I've never seen at breakfast.   Aside from that, just missing a bit of brown sauce, or maybe ketchup, then you're all set!
If that is the English breakfast, the dinner must be something that will crash the global food markets.
Try a full Scottish some time; all of the above, plus haggis and fruit pudding, white pudding, lorne sausage, and tattie (potato) scones. Because we just had to one-up the English!
Why do transphobes suddenly think Babish is taking a stance or making a statement with this sponsorship? You guys are delusional if you think Babish is some kind of transphobic mastermind that conjured this up. I highly doubt he is on y’all’s hateful side to be honest. I think it was just a mistake and I hope he aims to clear the air. My fingers are crossed for a redemption arc!
Blood sausage 🤤
Love the video. looks tasty
I love how this slightly implies that all British people are wizards
Keep making vids love watching these helped enhance my wife and i's meals!
This is a travesty. Man makes great dishes but this isn’t one of them.
Came here because of the yahoo news article. So far I like his videos. Officially subscribed !
Looks gotdamn delicious! Nice to see Harry Potter is sponsoring ya now
I have never once had a full English with a 'bubble and squeak'
That looks like Cholesterol - The Dish.
Here would be a fun Culinary challenge, Turn a Full English into a Breakfast Burrito
No wonder people hate trans <3
Dude your better than this      Please just don’t take sponsorships from games with British people in them ever, please.
I think my biggest question is how can the British afford to buy that much meat for breakfast alone??
lol im kidding
Babish you’re better than this.
Man babish, all five twitter users who were actually subscribed to you just unsubbed. How are you ever going to recover from this.
Its saddens me to know people are more worried about who sponsors his videos and not the content he creates
Love this and love Harry Potter! ❤
Love your videos and Hogwarts Legacy! Silence the snowflakes. We gotchu bro
Why? Incredibly disappointing...
I enjoyed this recipe. Also, I stand with Babish, Hogwarts Legacy and JK Rowling.
Yum! Can’t wait to make this.
The amount of idiocy shown in the comments is absurd, you all are hating and unsubscribing on a food creator just because they sponsored a game that was based on a transphobic writer. J.K Rowling and the game are DIFFERENT THINGS. They aren't the same, the game was made by other people, the money isn't going to JKR. He only took a sponsor, not that he made a video specifically supporting JKR. People that doesn't realise this seriously needs to change.
Very disappointed in you supporting transphobes
Feel free to chuck some chips in there if you want, especially if you're hungover. I think you're missing ketchup or HP source. I can't imagine someone eating a full English without them.
What griddle is this ?
Booooo
Looks delicios. Do you wash this down with tea, ale or cider?
Forget all the crybaby SJW losers.  Obviously they don't buy games
I appreciate that Babish sticks with his sponsors, and doesnt give into to the vocal minority who would erase women
Am here for the the food! Sticking around too. Side note: sorry  The game has Trans options, just an FYI. Yes she's gonna get money.  Not buying the game won't make a dent for her, but it will for the game devs. I don't agree with what she said. But I'm not gonna let that ruin the way the books and movies, and now the game makes me feel.
So much seething. It's hilarious.
Keep up the hogwards legacy stuff. I love the game and the Harry Potter franchise. Also love the food.
real disappointed in you b
Looks yummy!!
Unsubbing. Hogwarts Legacy is antisemitic propaganda that funds anti-trans legislation in the UK. It is beyond disappointing that you would partner with such hateful trash.
clowns, clowns everywhere
Welp, I have one less person to watch now.  But that's fine.  There's plenty of others to give support to, who WON'T advertise for a property that has become a vehicle for hate.
lovely video, Don't listen to the ideots that are making themselves look bad and keep doing you!
I subscribed to Babish today for the first time - not a huge foodie video watcher but I will always support people just living their life.
Ignore the hate man, this looks like a delicious meal and the game is great as well, so glad you got to sponsor em.
Day 215 of requesting big smokes order for Arcade with Alvin
i can only hope that you knew what you were doing here
a meal fit for the great hall🙂
It's great to see Babish keeping the same awesome quality content over the years 👋😁
Warning to Americans! The full english that's served in your hotel will likely be shoddy and mostly inedible. Find a Wetherspoons. It will cost less, be of a far higher standard and won't have been sat on a hot plate.
Love the wizarding world, love Hogwarts Legacy, love this channel, stay strong and keep up the great content.
libtards seething, you love to see it
Don't listen to the haters babish. It's just a videogame. The food looks delicious btw.
Please do not apologize for this. You did nothing wrong by taking this ad read. The people that are mad at you are blowing this waaaaay out of proportion.
Came to find this video and unsub as soon as I heard about it.
Keep that blood sausage
Hogwarts legacy was extremely disappointing
Ignore the losers
After so many years of subscribing I’m leaving due to taking money from a terf. So disappointed.
How is promoting the game wrong when there is a Trans character in the game?
Forget the non woke woke people babish you do you keep up the great content
Sorry, dude. Liked your content but can't support you supporting blatant transphobia and antisemitism. Hope you realize your mistake.
Hugely disappointed you decided to take money from the transphobe.
Was informed by Google that the hogwarts legacy add got you some controversy. Here's a like, comment, and I'm already subbed. Having grown up watching Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings.
Hogwarts Legacy brought me here. Ended up subscribing! Thanks so much for the entertainment!
Both platters look delicious!! 😋 😋
Would the internet explode if you livestreamed a culinary episode with JK ROWLING FROM HER ACTUAL CASTLE ? LOL
I thought you were an ally.
I hope this channel hits new levels because of this PC BS. These people are insane and tyrannical and just can't let people enjoy anything. Continue what you're doing Andrew. Love the channel love your food
Bad look, Babish.
Ima play this video on repeat for anyone thinking they’re doing anything by boycotting one of the best cooks on YouTube 😒
Amazing the difference in the comments here vs twitter. You could swear the entire trans community lives on twitter.
Love and always will love you Babish!!! ❤❤❤ Keep em coming
Hope the TERF money is worth it. Unsubscribed and never coming back.
Thank you for existing❤
❤️❤️
Never heard of this guy until the Hogwarts Legacy stuff. Stayed for the video now I'm hungry, lol. Subbed.
Decided to like and follow due to the hate he was receiving online. Wanted babish to know he still has loyal followers
Came here to laugh at anyone who unfollowed or unsubscribed from Babish because of the "controversy"
Lots of love from Belfast you should try an Ulster fry absolutely great 👍
I think I'm more bothered by the fact that this video has attracted a bunch of transphobes to the community than by the fact it's sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy. I can separate the artist from the advert for the art, so it doesn't bother me. Less happy that the comments are now full of people happy that trans people are upset.
Scottish breakfast is infinitely superior 😉
I fully support Babish and this video.  While I was sympathetic to the Trans cause before, their blatant attacks and hatred on things I love has really soured me on their approach.  I get hurt people hurt people, but this is basically baby temper tantrums.
Never heard of your channel until I read an asrticle saying a bunch of Lefties are canceling your channel for supporting Hogwarts. I love the game and have watched a few of your vids. Love your vids so i sub'd!
Extremely disappointed to see a fave creator advertising this antisemitic transphobia-supporting garbage game and trying to hide the backlash by deleting comments.  Edit: I've watched nearly every episode on this channel, many multiple times, and often shared them. I own a set of pots with Babish's face on them. But as it's been well enough time and I haven't seen any apologies I've now unsubbed and guess I'm moving on with my life. Sucks to lose another creator I looked up to.
Came here to support my guy fellow NY guy babish. ..note to the hateres right now ... Don't fight hate with hate. Educate , inform. Grow. Nothing babish did it supporting hate. He just made some delicious food . 💪💯🔥⚡👋
I here to laugh at the snowflakes attempting to cancel you for leftard logic reasons
I'll be watching this periodically so people that are boycotting this video aren't actually making as much of a difference 🤣
Can’t believe people unsubscribe to his channel due to his sponsor of hog warts
Why can't people learn to separate the art from the artist. The art in this case is even a subdivision of the original art; a game based on the original novel. Even if you hate J.K. Rowling for her views, you don't need to go that far. Twitter "people" are insane in the head 💀
hogwarts is a great game and you're a great channel keep it up king
Game rocks, and Babish rocks.
Excellent content and might I just say that hogwarts legacy is an amazing game. A couple of whiney SJWs in the news aren't gonna stop my man Babish!
New here 😉, can't wait to binge all the videos!
Thank you for the great content, as usual! This looks delicious!
First step....wrong *sigh*
I unsubscribed because of his use of mushrooms. I felt so betrayed. JK.. but the news on this guy is so silly. When did we add a society get so dramatic?
Love the hard work you've all been putting in! I've been a fan of the show for so many years and have learned so much. Come so far from Charlie's milk steak! Here's to 10mil subscribers
Haven't even watched the video yet.  Just came here to support. Always love your work Babish and don't let the mindless hate being thrown at what is a great game get to you at all.
all the hate you're getting for this game ad reminded me I haven't watched one of your videos in a while. love your book 🖤🖤
That article reminded me I need to binge some babish :) love the vids
Well, this is incredibly disappointing. Enjoy your hate-filled terf money without me. Unsubscribing. 💔
i'm a simple gal .. i see harry potter, i unfollow ✌️
I cant be the only person who verbally exclaimed when he said bubble and squeak in a fry up 🤣
Great video Babish, my family has loved your videos for 5 years now.
Just came because ppl are mad that u have the harry potter video game ad here...i am so extremely tired of ppl doing that..trying to force their beliefs down someone elses throats when it isnt warranted...i can see if jk said some undeniably hateful things..but she said she doesnt agree with changing terms to suit the few when it takes away so much from the many, now shes hated because she said that...ppl have turned it into something it never was, claiming she said things she never said...keep doing u dont feed into the crapola coming ur way
I've always enjoyed your videos. The fact you did this one despite the uninformed backlash you'd get / are getting is why I now subscribe. Keep on keeping on and do what you wanna do.
Just a reminder to everyone that twitter isn’t a real place and literally no one cares about Babish being sponsored by an ad about a game based off a series by JK Rowling
I came here because of the "ad" from the wokies, sub now
Imagine being so insane to think a sponsered add from video game about wizards is Fashist. OMEGALUL
Curious why you did the Americanized version in the oven and not on a flat top. We have griddles too?
I was scrolling through Google and I was like, Hey, I know this man!!!
Unsubbing because this channel took a sponsorship from a game owned by someone who's specifically stated that she believes support of the franchise and the game is tantamount to support for her extremely anti-trans views.  I really am terribly disappointed anyone making the decisions for this channel would agree to this.
I don't care about this channel enough to watch but I have to subscribe and like this video.
great video as allways
Game is great. You are great. Doubt you noticed the whiny babies leaving 😂
Keep up the amazing work babish. Love your channel and love the game as well
Heard about these ppl unsubbing from this channel over the whole HP Legacy, which I think is completely ridiculous. So I came to give my support, you now have a new follower!!
Here because I saw a hate article and wanted to makes sure that you weren't being bullied for someone else's fighting.  Here is another view and comment for you because you deserve it for the work you put into these.
at 1:26, why use unsalted butter then immediately season with salt? Why not use salted butter? Any feedback appreciated.  Great videos, thanks man!
It's hilarious and sad that you're getting hate because you like the Harry Potter universe 😮😵 a dumb thing to get angry about
I don't normally leave a comment on videos but "something" told me I think your Wonderful videos especially this one deserve as much activity from fans as possible
Based with Babish 💪
a breakfast with troons tears, what a delight
Heard about your channel from someone saying they were unsubscribing due to this video. I'm more than happy to take their place as a new subscriber.
You don’t rise to the top without gaining some haters. Babish is the goat 🐐
As a Brit, this looks nice.
A hate article got me here and seriously I am amazed by your videos..keep up the awesome work!!!
just subbed solely bc of this video
Awesome video, great breakfast. Please ignore the hate, these people will never be satisfied.
The drama brought me here. So i have decided to subscribe to Babish.
Keep being you
Don't understand why everyone is mad about  his sponsor
Glad the drama brought me here, such lovely culinary skills! Thank you.
Ridiculous people are unsubbing because of the sponsor. Keep doing what you do babish, love you ❤
Babish this video is amazing! Thank you for the great content
Tasty as always. And I really want to buy that game but I’ll probably buy it later in the year as I haven’t been playing games for a while but this game seems awesome
Hogwarts Legacy is great, don't let the woke morons cancel you. Their boycott has failed spectacularly so far, we will not surrender to hate.
Q: Why hasn't Babish addressed the "controversy" about this sponsorship? A: Probably not worth his time. He's seen it, he has WB's money, he's thinking to himself "Just One time" And to the haters: How about educate Babish on WHY this sponsorship was a bad call? Was there an uproar when YouTubers did Established Titles spots? How is this any different?
Hmmm. Our phones has Cobalt that is used in lithium battery, then the phone is manufactured in China. Where’s the outcry about all that??? People want to paint yourself as this “saintly” person who takes a stand against “transphobia” but neglects everything else. Either way we’re all culprits of some kind atrocity that’s being taken place. So don’t come on here with this hyperbolic take of “oh what a way to end your career.” As a matter of fact I wasn’t subscribed to this channel, now I am and I liked the video, and I’m going to tell my beautiful woman wife to the same! So back off!
Just saw an ad on google about people leaving the channel because of the hogwarts ad.   Just wanted to share my support to you Andrew and I will continue to love your content
You have enough money.
I'm glad whiners got mad at him, I hadn't heard of him but now I subscribed.
Nice work taking TERF money.
12 million units sold , 850 million and more in revenues. So Ggs to the abcdefgvwxyz cancel culture community.
Love it and can't wait to eat it while playing the game
Where's the uproar? 💀💀🤣
Your actual subscribers and fans support you. Ignore the trolls and narcissists. The majority of normal every day people could not care less about toxic online wokeism.
Cancel culture has no power.
I subscribed to balance out the cancel culture.
Hate brought me here. Sensitive people unsubscribing made me stay and subscribe. 😂
Also came here because of an article expressing hate. Watched this and a few other videos and now I'm hooked. You're awesome man!
Been a fan for years. Don't sweat the online bullies. Just wanted to thank you for getting me into cooking but never took the time to comment.
I’m so happy I ate right before watching 😊 I can’t wait to get the Hogwarts Legacy game on the Switch 🎉
TERF approved breakfast 🤢
Great vid as always! Ignore the haters!
I have to say, I've been watching you for years. I have never been disappointed in the recipes you make or the quality of your videos. Keep on being an amazing creator and person!
Love you love your videos and love hogwarts.
Subbed today
I came and liked the video because of the Yahoo Article. The game is amazing and in no way offensive. I support all communities, but trying to go at babs for a video game that doesn't do anything wrong is ridiculous.
Read an article saying everyone is abandoning the channel because of the Hogwarts Legacy ad, it reminded me I need to come subscribe.
Thank you so much for supporting the transphobic and antisemitic creator of Harry Potter!! It's also so cool how comments critiquing you about it are just being deleted! What a shill.
Subscribed. the sponsor is great, the author is greater! Don’t be put down, By the words of a hater!
Thanks for the Hogwarts Legacy recommendation! I picked it up and it's really fun. Probably going to buy a Switch copy too when it releases. The first breakfast platter looks delicious! I've never heard of black pudding/blood sausages before. I wonder if they're similar to sundae (Korean blood sausages).
I'm waiting to get a pa5 before I buy the game. Looks awesome
Great video!
Can't believe there are people mad at Rowling because she wants to keep natural born women protected 😂😂 man people are pathetic
Initially missed this episode, but so glad I came back to watch it. All these articles trying to slam Babby for literally no reason....zero of the fans that have been here for a long time are upset.
No cancelation here, I love Hogwarts Legacy And My Boi Babish
I doubt I am the first to throw this out there but I would love to see a collaboration with you and Beard Meats Food.
I gotta love all the attention seeking losers still crying salty crocodile tears over a Hogwarts Legacy ad 😂🤡💀
His videos never fail to make me hungry. I've been religiously watching this channel for years and can't wait to watch a video everytime it comes out!
Cringing with Babish
Based
Thought "nah I don't like english breakfast. I don't need to watch this."  Saw this Yahoo bullshittery and here I am watching full-length commenting and leaving a like!
I saw the article and came here immediately to support this man. He shouldn't have to suffer because of this all or nothing cancel culture. Plus he makes some awesome food here!
Dont listen to the idiots. Love you babish, its just an ad and i love the game regardless of anything.
Dont give in to the mindless twitter bullies. You did nothing wrong. Your real fans still love your content.
Bubble and squeak isn't usually part of a full English, as others have said, it could be replaced with hash browns, but you don't necessarily need potatoes. Also, sausages are only called bangers when accompanied by mash, otherwise they are just sausages.
Great video as always. Always do great content. And all the ppl "unsubscribing" because of Hogwarts legacy...get over it. Amazing game, amazing food made.
Came here to like and give a view to counteract at least one of the bullying zealots that are trying to take you down.  Been subbed forever, but don't watch as often as I should.
I subscribed because of the Yahoo article. The breakfast looks delicious. I never subbed to you before, but I enjoyed the vids.
Do not fold to the noise. Been watching since your Red Dead Redemption 2 video. Now I want an English breakfast! You should do a Filipino Breakfast some time. 🇵🇭
Here to support the creator not what people have done.
The people complaining about the game are honestly ridiculous. She didn’t make the game, a studio did. The devs are not obligated to agree with someone who is not even involved with the project. And plus, she has more than, and I mean MORE THAN enough money to do basically whatever she wants. A couple million dollars she will likely make from this game will essentially be a drop in the bucket. Calm down, for crying out loud.
Love watching Babish even if I have zero desire to try a particular dish. Blood sausage?  Just can't go there! I think I'll edit/cancel this menu down to bacon, eggs, and hash browns. edit: plus the cherry tomatoes
I should really stop watching cooking videos when I'm hungry lol
They need to chill, Babish isn't hurting anyone. They are just a bunch of miserable people that won't be happy until everyone else is just as miserable as they are.
to the people who got triggered about this video, i hope he makes 9 more videos about it.
Babish, please check what you let sponsor you. Please don't promote the work of anti transgender creators.
Glad you weened out the weak ones
Hogwarts Legacy is amazing! Your channel is also amazing!
Love you Andrew. And the whole crew too. Keep up the fantastic work.
Cool, you took a sponsorship for the TERF game. Subscription canceled.
I love bubbles and squeak and thank you for your amazing recipes
Do you like that your comments are filled with transphobia? Smh, I expected better.
I'm here because of the haters. We love you babish. Keep doing what you do bud! Snowflakes gotta get over themselves.
Sorry, I am out. You lost a trans subscriber.
Make your money big man.
Liked and subscribed just because common sense should prevail over foolishness.
Imagine swarming a video about a delicious breakfast over an ad. The internet has rotted people’s brains.
Cashing those checks
Not bubble and squeak, hash browns
Your bubble is completely wrong 🤦
Hey Babish, long time viewer. I figured that it’d be more productive to give words of encouragement than words of anger/disdain.   I just want to say that whatever hate you get from this video for the sponsor, please do not apologize for doing it. People should be mature enough to know that the game has nothing to do with the perceived views of the author or yourself.  There is nothing wrong with playing or endorsing this game. Anyone who says otherwise is disturbed and truly has nothing better to do than complain on Twitter, which then gives media outlets something to clickbait people with.  It’s happened to other YouTubers and it always passes. Thanks for making great cooking videos, can’t wait for the next one!
I also came here based on the article.  I didn’t know about this dude previously but needed to come click there like button to make those lunatic liberal tears fly!    Whiny little weirdos, ain’t they?
What idiots shaming this man over this, get outta here.
I doubt this man is very upset over losing some extremist fans.
People are pathetic to get upset over a sponsorship. Do they not have anything better to do than shaming people for no reason?
Usually love your content but really don't appreciate the whole platforming a racist, antisemetic, terf like JKR :/ Pick a better sponsor
I have come to defend my favorite chef from stupidity. I love your videos. Someday I want a full English brekkie. Please stay and keep doing your magic please🥰
What ever you do, DO NOT APOLOGIZE TO THE MOB!!!!
TROONS WILL NOT DIVIDE US. TROONS WILL NOT DIVIDED US.
Everyone out here hating on Andrew, but I commend the hustle and the entertainment he provides. Everyone needs to grow up and stop fabricating these excuses to spread actual hate on others. The game is amazing and you are all small-minded individuals for disrespecting people over the analytical thoughts of an author who actually made sense and nobody wanted to actually read or hear of it because they'd rather jump into their feelings.
Just subscribed. Don't let the true fascists win. Telling a person they have to think like you is fascism.
The fact that Babish can even make British food look edible is a testament to his cooking prowess
Came here from an article related to the hogwarts legacy add. Now im in love with all this content. AND i own hogwarts legacy great game and beleive it or not i have no problem with trans people soooo crazy
Subscribed due to the news article. You have my support.
Came here to make sure I was subbed.
Great Video! I've learned so much from your content, please continue to do such great work. Thank you so much!
Man people be soft asf abt Hogwarts
Came here just to support BB.
Andrew man! Still the best cooking show I watch!
binging with basedbish
I'm here because I heard the woke mob is bashing you just making sure now u get more support will be referring this awesome channel to everyone!
Just sayin, i was subscribed already, but then i saw the yahoo news about the "controversy" you seem to have aquired. I wish i could subscribe again. Love you and your content still!
Y'all need to stop with Hogwarts. You know who you are. It's not transphobic, it's not endorsing J.K. If you're on the hate train trying to take down Babish you're sad. You know what you're doing... Y'all are messed up for that. Don't try to get between a man and his paper because you want your voice to be heard. Anyone else agree? I can't be the only one who thinks this is crazy...
Make sausage rolls because I want to see how it's done because Gordon Ramsay loves them
I'm following and watching the videos because if the hate from hella people. Keep the hustle going
Came here cause I heard he was losing followers over the terf Cow. People need to stop attacking Harry Potter fans for what that hoe said. I've even seen people attack a trans gaymer for streaming the game. Kinda ridiculous and not at all getting the message when you're spreading hatred over a hateful woman's words.
😢😥😥😥😥😥😥🫡 bye
Subscribed to combat the clowns that are trying to cancel this man
All honesty they said you took a dip in subs but i still see you have 10 mil
People are gonna boycott this meal now that it is affiliated with hogwarts legacy
I own some of your knives and they are awesome, I'll be picking up more.of your cookware soon. My son's birthday is coming up in April, he's been asking about a certain video game. I'll be getting him that too.
I subbed because of this video
GO BABISH!!!!!
New follower just because that Google article, do you bro who cares about the negative people who can't accept who they are and not worry about what other people think of them
Cancel culture fails again. He's got more subscribers now than before you cried.
Subscribed just because of cancel culture.
Y’all will cry about everything I swear, leave this man alone y’all stay complaining 🙄
Here, and followed because of all the woke idiots whining.
Sir you get my like and subscribe purely for being based and not bending to spoiled brats.
Also discovered this guy because of the “controversy”.  Kind of sad cancel culture is trying to get this guy.  He is great!😊
I came here when I heard the news of the woke MF's trying to cancel this dude, and immediately subscribed.
BWB will make you delicious meals, regardless of what the news articles say.   I'd devour that meal QUICK 😁
The amount of passive TRANSPHOBIA going on in these comments is insanel. I don't think supporting JK Ro/HP Legacy is transphobic but some of the people in these comments are just plain spilling their transphobic hearts out. Yikes 😬
Yeah Hogwarts J.K. rocks. I actually hate Harry Potter but J.K. rocks. If she has to respect your beliefs then you should show the same respect for hers.
Babish. Please dont listen to the twitter mob. Its just a video game
I'm sure the people outraged about this video have no problem spreading their hate, using devises manufactured with the help of literal slaves.
My family loves watching Babish. We’re going to keep watching. Keep going Andy!
i came back to this vid for the spicy comments, i am disappointed. what yahoo news considers “outrage” is pretty low…
I’ve enjoyed your content for the last few years, but after seeing the news article came to this video specifically to voice my support for what you do. People are in an uproar over this video game. Just because someone supports a video game does not mean they agree with the opinions and views of the person who created the source material. Keep doin your thing!
Calling sausage bangers sounds so wrong
If you came here to support Babish 👇
Yes, please. Where would one find blood sausage without making it themselves?
Imagine boycotting a YouTube chef and not chick fil a or conversion therapy charities or tobacco companies, nah the guy cooking and making asmr is the evil one.
I just realised I wasn’t subscribed to you. But the Yahoo! article put that right. Hogwarts Legacy is such a fun game!
Hogwarts is amazing!!!
A yahoo article showing hate for you has only led me to subscribing to you and loving you and the food you make.
Leviosaaaaa that meal into my mouth
Never heard of this man before I seen him put on blast on the internet for asinine reasons, now after watching a few videos I love your passion and cooking! Suscribed
Always love your videos! Helps me get the motivation I need to get into the kitchen myself!!
I love the video. And I can confirm Hogwarts Legacy is an amazing game I love it so far
You don't get to be neutral on a moving train
J. K. Rowling said just told the truth🤷🏿‍♂️. Let’s keep supporting this guy making great food
Dude we love this channel and we love the video game! Nothing is going to change for you! We support you!
I am not with the twittards, I will not unsubscribe. Keep going Andrew
Keep on cooking my dude don't let people put you down for your passion of cooking
Article: "Fans heartbroken by HP ad" Fans: "BuBbLe AnD SqUeAk?!?"
Thank you babish for not bending the knee to goofball ideologues
Eat some breakfast and then play Hogwarts Legacy. Sounds like a chill Saturday morning.😊
I love this channel and that's what makes the hogwarts legacy ads so disappointing
I hate to bring attention to the unjustified hate toward this channel, but I'm confused about what exactly the issue is. I understand JKR has some pretty awful views on things, and you are more than justified not wanting to buy anything from her, but there is no excuse for trying to ruin a man trying just make a living over this. She makes upwards of $50 to $100 MILLION dollars EVERY YEAR from royalties, not including this game. Sales from this game are such small drop in the bucket that it's almost negligible. Have you ever watched the movies? Rented or bought the books? Gone to Universal Studios? Guess what? She's made money. She's so filthy rich that all of her revenue streams could be cut off right now and she'd live a more comfortable life than any of us, so whats the point of ruining the livelyhood of people just trying to make a living over this?
I was led here by a yahoo article and looks like a great channel to subscribe to! That's what the Yahoo article was trying to say, right? I am hungry now. Mmm.
Great video
Gimme piece!
Looks delicious
Andrew, please don't listen to the "cancel culture" haters out there. This was an awesome dish and Hogwarts Legacy was a perfect sponsor because it's a great game. The alphabet gang are slowly losing their voice because no one is listening anymore.
I came here and subscribed bc of a ridiculous Yahoo article shaming him for the Hogwarts Legacy ad. Looks delicious and looks like a great sub anyway!
Found a article hating on this video for being sponsored by hogwarts legacy and it lead me to subscribe to you, not hate on you.  This looks delicious, wish people would get over this J.K. Rowling thing already.  Seperate the work from the author, that is what I had to do with Rurouni Kenshin.
No publicity is bad publicity I love this dude's videos and hope you don't cave under the wave of cancel culture stay strong man
Im here because of all the salty cry babies shaming this man, ima share this video to all my friends, share this to fight against cancel culture, and like and subscribe.
Love your content ✨️ babbish ignore the ignorant haters 👏 👌
If you spend life worrying if every little peanut passes through the hands of a biggot I've got some bad news for you...
disappointed to see BCU taking money from a known transphobe, not apologizing, and deleting all comments that discuss JK Rowlings transphobia and how she directly benefits from game sales. i thought better of you. unfollowing.
Great video man!!! My friends and I have been watching your channel for many years and will continue to do so for many more! Very professional and in depth video as always, you and your crew should be proud of the channel you've grown and created!
Just wanted to say Babish is awesome and so is hogwarts legacy. All these salty haters can cry more coping tears
Keep up the great content! Don’t let the haters change you or what you do. ❤️
Love the content babish stay strong and ignore the haters
Came to subscribe out of spite. I have always enjoyed your content. Your appearance on hot one was awesome too. Keep up the great work
Came to show my support for Andrew after the BS yahoo article. Always great videos man and the game is awesome.  Can’t believe some people are so delusional.
Awesome video! The food looks DELICIOUS! I hope you make some Spanish cuisine in the future; would love to see your twist on it!
I too came here to subscribe and support someone who doesn't bow to liberal fascists.
Awesome content in this Vid. I don't mind the cooking stuff either.
Love it.
Yahoo is crying over the add you played and spreading false news.....keep doing you man...been watching your videos for a very long time.
Saw an article that fans were "up in arms" so I came by to make sure I was subscribed and liked the video. Also I plan on getting Hogwarts legacy as soon as I get a ps5 or new gaming rig so anyone that's mad can be mad at me too!
Hogwarts is a great game!
It's just a game. A game that actually features trans characters. The people complaining that JK makes money from it are the same people who continue to buy the books and merch and stream the films - and she actually makes way more money off of those.
Came due to the hate. Wanted man to know I support him, not wokeness
Looks delicious ✌️
Great Content!! The Game is amazing! 100% Harry Potter fan. I am not a conformist so I do NOT make my decisions out of what is “popular” opinion or issue in society like some. Nor do I care about other peoples opinions or dislikes/likes. I will continue to support your channel because you are very creative and I’m here for it!!!🎉
Love this video and love the sponsors! Awesome work by your team and perpetually putting forward superb content. Keep the Harry Potter sponsorship coming
Hadn't watched in a while, saw the hate so  thought I would come back. A full english is delicious but I'd never really seen bubble and squeak with it. As a brit I'd normally had it with hash browns or a rosti.
Could never leave babish, let the haters starve.
Hateful, ignorant bullies never win. Don't let them by giving in, it only makes them even worse bullies. Keep on doing what you do.
Okay people need to chill for real.
Huh, based on the article I just read I thought Andy was evil all of a sudden because Hogwarts reasons
New sub. Here to support you because you have a right to make money any way you want. Cheers,
Oh man, I thought you stopped making videos because they stopped popping up in my feed. Ends up I was unsubscribed. Thanks youtube!
I subscribed to support you while these mental issues having weirdos are hating. Love your content.
Found your channel when someone posted that you were hateful. Stayed bc that's a lie and your filming style and meals are intriguing.
You the man you changed the way I look at food keep it up my dude
Saw you are getting silly people upset, came to watch it and click on the ads.  Thanks for the years of great content!
Oh right, we don't watch here anymore
nothing screams more than "my life is a joke" than hating on someone for taking a sponsorship for some video game like its the end of the world, cheers babish
We will not let you get canceled by the radical idiots, keep up the amazing work!
It's always in the name of Inclusivity and acceptance that the most hateful and intolerant people show their true color
Though I disagree with Miss Rowlings' anti-trans beliefs. I'm still in love with the Harry Potter universe and will continue to purchase it's products.  Though she makes money off it, Harry Potter is much more than it's creator now.
I want to try making this!
Why are people mad with hogwarts? It's just a game?
Subscribed and keep up the awesome work.
🔥🔥🔥
Just here to support your decision on the ad which has nothing to do with anything but a game. Woke people are loud so I'm screaming back
unsubbed, sorry, do  not support terfs
If you're upset at people for buying this game, and claim that they support the mistreatment of trans people, by that same logic you support the exploitation and under paying of foreign factory workers who bust their arses off for a pittance just so you can scream on twitter with your shiny new iPhone. You're just as bad.
Been a fan of yours for a long time. But now unsubbed. I can't support someone who is either too oblivious or too apathetic to stand in solidarity with me and people I love.
Love food and love Harry Potter! You got a new sub!
Awesome content! Don't let the snowflakes ruin your day ;)
Can we make this his most viewed video?
I love the fact that people are still mad about hogwarts legacy, the team that made it have nothing to do with JK and its really sad that people are actually unsubbing because of a sponsor, all the people who are still attempting to boycott it are just making it more popular, its practically free advertising for them. So stay mad, game gets more money. Anyone who is actually mad at the game can cope. Just dont buy it. Problem solved.
transphobe
All the TWEETS about how this is sooooo bad and promoting hate and such, well you're using Twitter, a platform owned by someone who is openly against the ideas they complain someone MAKING AN ENGLISH BREAKFAST
The one thing I don't get with English blood sausage (black pudding) is the fact it's so sweet, which I don't really think goes too well with the rest of the breakfast.
subbed, for standing against cancel fascist, i got pulled into this nonsense like millions of others, they(no pun intended) are getting annoying :D
W sponsorship
lol those dislikes from "supporters"
Wait people actually watch the ads?
For those not in the know, there is an article out there that is saying Babish is quote: “in hot water with fans” and that people are “unsubscribing” in large numbers. How many is he at now? Ten million? Yeah, but they’re all unsubbing 🙄😂 The article is of course a completely ridiculous smear campaign in an attempt to cancel Babish. Don’t pay any attention to the cult members, or anyone else who drinks the koolaid. I now support Babish more. End communication.
I hope you guys know the only thing you did was make this video have even more views than average, sure showed them
Came for the ads at the beginning and end. Stay based, king.
I see a ton of comments saying how this video is getting hate, but I'm not really seeing it. I see a lot of people who support JK Rowling and are anti-leftist and think LGBT are dumb haters whining for no reason
Stay strong brother, you did nothing wrong HL is a brilliant game.
Make sure and report as many hateful comments as you can, even if they dont get removed they still get logged by the YouTube algorithm.
Started watching during the pandemic back when the best I could make was cereal, now I'm cooking meats with sides and sauces. Thank you for everything you do
keep it up babish your true fans love u!!!!
LOVE THE AD AND YOUR CONTENT! KEEP IT UP!!!!
Here to support the legend
Saw the article about the hate so I came back to watch it again and check the like to dislike ratio, 30k likes to 14k dislikes.  Frankly that's absurd, ignore them babish.
Looks delicious, awesome content 🙏🏽
Wow making money off off the antisemitic terf game huh, hope you know how disappointed we all are in you. you know you're going to lose so many followers man. :\
Saw a hogwarts ad so I subbed
Never watched a video but saw an article that talked about the sponsorship so I thought I check it out subscribed
This isn't a full English breakfast, those lobsters only eat pastry and garbage. I do appreciate your cooking though, it does look amazing
Just here to give my support to a favorite culinary channel of mine. Unnecessary hate from randos that can't differentiate politics from entertainment. Hope everyone's day is going well
Dang dude, they got whole news articles about this video causing people to unsub and IT'S STILL UP 8 DAYS LATER??? Guess he's not worried about it while he's raking in that big TERF money... I bet he's crying all the way to the bank!
Love the video. My wife and I have been fans for a while now.  Ignore the hate the vids are great.
My kids have been playing the game in shifts. I was thinking about making them eggs and soldiers, but maybe this!
No interest in Babish but wanted to see how miniscule the trash are. Looks like they didn't even make a dent... Hahahahahahahahahaha
Babish Don't pay mind too the idiots angry over a fun wizard game because they can't accept reality you've done nothing wrong they're just being petty
This looks so delicious and amazing.  Keep up the great work bro! You're one of the best youtubers out there.
Get your money. Ignore the ridiculous transactivists. I'd call them dickless but....
Trans people are so sensitive. The man is trying to make money so he can produce more videos.
Losers are trying to cancel you becouso of the game 🤣🤣🤣 keep it up 🫡 your videos are awesome 🤗🤗
"Wahh wahh wahh, cater to me,  0.5% of the population!" - Trannos. Put a sock in it you disgusting freaks.
Probably mentioned a million times.  Don't watch these videos on an empty stomach.
sponsor'd by harry potter 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
TREATING BABISH THE WAY YOU ARE IS WAY WORSE THAN ANY OPINION JK ROWLING HAD! SHAME ON YOU! If you want to prevent her from profiting then BOYCOTT her but  being mean to him is no different than how you perceive people to treat you ya jerks! You are demanding acceptance of your opinion, demanding acceptance and not nicely the IMMEDIATELY do that exact thing to this well liked gentleman without so much as letting the poor guy defend himself or better yet; HE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO: FREE SPEECH ANYONE?! y'all talk a lot of bs but you are worse for not showing even a little bit to anyone else. I want to reach through this phone soooo bad.... .
You have my full support!!!!!
45 seconds, are you telling me people are trying to cancel banish over 45 seconds???
Babish, if they unsubbed because of a game, pay them no mind. Your awesome.
Based Babish
Heard you're getting hate because of Hogwart's legacy. I just subscribed and will watch. Thank you.
Over easy<basted eggs I said what I said
Bro! Luv ya! Don't stop making content and don't regret yoir sponsor! Yoir still the GOAT!
Babiiiish, much love
I subscribed to your channel because this video 👍
I can't believe people are unsubscribing because he did an ad for Hogwarts Legacy when JK Rowling had NOTHING to do with the game.
Lol had to make sure I was subscribed, glad I did cuz I wasn’t. Fixed that.
So apparently you're in "Hot Water" No pun intended because you have a Hogwarts Legacy ad lol How funny is that
Love your videos man I've been watching a long time my absolute favorite video is "Jakes sandwich" from adventure time. But it's odd how you're deleting comments. Nothing against it just odd.
My man babish with this goated sponsorship
Honestly I decided to subscribe to you basically to show my support of how people unfairly treated you about this particular episode.  ...Also the concept for your channel sounded genuinely cool too! Looking forward to looking through!
Really grossed out by this sponsorship, do better
Anyone who thinks hogwarts legacy is problematic is an idiot.
I just came to say I did not know about you, but I came to suscribe and will like all your videos from this one on as support due to the hate you are receiving by ridiculous, nonsense people.
All of these people who are attacking BwB for doing a video about a game that purposely tried to distance themselves from JK and her views are just straight up delusional... if you took 5 minutes to do a little bit of research the devs made it a point to include people of all walks of life. even though the game takes place in 1899. and it was a crime to be out and open about your personal life if it wasn't man and woman. the devs painted a Wizarding World that was tolerant and accepting of all genders and orientations. I could care less what jk opinion is because it is just that her opinion which each and every one of us is entitled to... I love the lore and World she created. but I don't have to agree with her personal views and values... I also don't go trying to cancel people who don't agree with me about various topics or politics... those who are attacking are just as guilty for intolerance as jk or in this nutty instance BwB for making a dish and getting sponsored by a game developer who went against jk and include as many genders and types of partnerships as they could with out making that a theme in a game about wizards witches goblins and magic. Hate stops when we all can accept each other for what we are regardless of views and opinions politics etc. I support you Andrew keep doing you... most of the Hate is from banner waving idiots who have no idea what they are actually mad about. nor did they make an effort to see what the game is trying to do with distancing it from jk and her narrow minded opinions..
The food looks great! I know Hogwarts Legacy has a lot of cultural / political stuff floating around it, I found the game fun and one of the best "Harry Potter Universe" games we have ever seen. I wish people would leave politics out of games. I can disagree with a person's beliefs and views and still enjoy the universe they created. She had nothing to do with the game outside of the fact that the game takes place in a universe she created. I love the universe, that doesn't mean I agree with the writers personal beliefs and views.
New sub, read the yahoo article.   Great video, awaiting more :)
Man, I wonder what the concrete number of people is who just watched this to make fun of the, like, 6 or 7 people who unsubscribed for a short Hogwarts ad. The author sucks, but not everyone can be omniscient about the issue when most fans grew up with the books and never cared about the author.  It is crazy to see how many people will go out of their way just to be jerks. Y'all need a hobby that isn't calling people names, like cooking.
Always bringing the best food!
I don't even like Harry Potter, but now I'm convinced to buy it
Here to show support. The haters can starve and get mad to death.
The most unCanadian "Canadian Bacon" to ever be cooked.
Love how all these English blokes jump on here a.s.a.p preaching about how bubbles and squeak isn't apart of a "full english"
Hey Babish! I've heard that certain people are butthurt because of this video's sponsor... I just hope you know that your real fans wouldn't leave you just because you promoted something they don't like. Me (and hopefully many others) stand by you, your content and this channel. Thank you for being here and making amazing content for us! ❤️
Have you guys seen the "news articles" (like Yahoo) trying to cancel Andrew for having a Harry Potter ad, because JK Rowling is "anti-trans"? That *hit is hilarious - the radical left is truly insane. I wonder when semi-rational lib voters will wake up to the insane nonsense of the far left and just stop voting for it 🤔 . Not soon enough, I fear.
Great stuff as usual! As a brit living this side of the pond I'd have loved to see you give your take on making english sausages on scratch though. I struggle to find anything worthy over here and have come to the conclusion that I better invest in meat grinder and make them myself
Your videos are amazing and I have made at least 10 of you dishes all fantastic.. keep making videos babish. Keep learning and improving like you all ways do I'm with ya
Hogwartz legacy is a fantastic game. Looking forward to watching this when i am not at work.
Baaaaased
Hi: New Follower and Supporter here, Indeed, a family of us. Don't bend knee to the goofs that act like what they are calling others.  YOU do great work.
PLEASE don't let the snowflakes give him heat over a Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship. That is the dumbest reason to persecute someone. Then again M&Ms mascots were canceled over mf shoes 💀
Looks delicious!
Dude forget the haters man always have and always will love you….and Hogwarts Legacy is the best new game
The strongest enemies of the trans community are themselves. They wonder why so many people hate them when they're going out of their way to harass and defame a YouTuber for being "transphobic."
Love you Babish.
You either die a liberal, or you live long enough to see yourself become the bigot.  Welcome to bigotry Babish.  Congratulations on your transition.
Babish could have not taken the sponsor, but instead he chose money over whiney crybabies in his comments, hopfully it pays off.
I've been craving an English breakfast
Keep doing what you’re doing!
I support this video and channel!!
I do love a full English, just never at breakfast time.  Hogwarts is fun, could use more rpg elements, but kudos to the devs
Love the content! You never cease to make me hungry during every video
I hope to enjoy such a breakfast
I subscribed to help even out the ones leaving because of JKR, hopefully, it helps mate.
Wouldn't normally sub to a food channel, but heard the rabid woke mob is frothing at the mouth for this channel's demise because of a video sponsor.  So, here's my sub, and looks like I'm only one among many to do so.  That Full English Breakfast sure does look tasty.
I think I just found my new favourite YouTube channel. Hogwarts legacy is one of the greatest games of all time and I'm excited to see you make a dish based on the Harry Potter world.
I neither knew the game existed or was really interested in this channel until people started whining. Now I plan getting both the game and I've subscribed to this channel and I'm leaving comments to boost it in the algorithm and I'm gonna like it. I never live videos.
Subscribed, I'm going to try making some of these dishes
Came here for Harry Potter refs
Stay strong.  Don't cave
The amount of snowflakes upset over the ad for hogwarts is priceless 🤣
I'm a new subscriber!! Love your content!!
Haven't watched your videos in a while, but when I read people unsubscribed to you because of this sponsorship, I had to come by and leave a like!
You cant make everyone happy. I for one heard about the pushback from the far left and went out of my way to sub. Keep doing you!
I’m a new sub.  Those woke snowflakes can pound sand.
I don’t support cancel culture, so I’m here to leave a like and subscribe.
I saw something that said people are mad at him for this
Cool, blood libel sausage.
hey babish man idk if u read this but whoever’s unsubbing from you are idiots i’ve been watching you for years and i won’t stop
Anyone who is upset about your sponsor is truly pathetic.
I've been watching Babish content for YEARS now. Between him & AB, I've learned almost all I know about feeding myself & others. That's why, after hearing all the 'controversy', I felt the immediate need to come here & ACTUALLY like, share, & subscribe.  Supporting nothing except for this channel, the content, & those involved with creating it. I encourage any others to do the same.
I love your food so much! And also love hogwarts legacy, I don't give 2 sh*ts what anyone says. You keep being awesome!
JK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE GAME.  IF YOU CANT GET OVER THAT LEAVE.  I HAPPILY HAVE SUB BECAUSE HE DOESN'T DESERVE THE HATE.  JUST BECAUSE PEOPLE CANT SEAM TO SEPARATE A PERSON FROM THEIR WORK DONT TAKE IT OUT ON PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST MAKING A LIVING
Your videos helped me during the pandemic. Thanks. Don't mind the tide of extremists and never doubt the quality of your great job.
tf is with the dislikes
Gotta thank an article online talking about all the "hate" this vid is getting, wouldn't have seen it otherwise
Welcome to the 'wrong side of history' for giving this game attention.  Please enjoy your complimentary canceling as you realize why certain communities have such terrible reputations.
As a person who has watched you for a while, bought your cookbook, and loved many things you've done, im horribly disappointed you accepted sponsorship money from a transphobe.   Real downer. You lost a fan, and gained a person who will tell others to not support your channel.
"Why would anyone ever eat something other than breakfast food?"
Honestly sad to see this on the channel.
Breakfast foods are my favorite foods
Unfortunate.
I guess you needed the money? Well look on the bright side, you got a lot of people subbed just bc they think you dont care about lgbtq+ people. Saw my transphobic bully share this on facebook. Apparently you are “based” now.
Let the haters hate, been following for years keep it up bro!
I’ve had a lot of English brekkies and this is legit!
People are really crying cuz of a sponsor. I have yet to understand why people think that just because you like something that was made by a person, it means you like the person. There are a lot of songs I love by artists i hate. Let people live there lives and get over yourselves
Hercule Poirot would approve.
Awesome meal, awesome game!
New sub here. Don't be bullied by the vocal minority. Breakfast looks awesome.
Way to make British food actually look appetizing!
Subbed because my feed was talking about idiots who are unsubbing because of a game 😂. Looks like a great channel, glad you were reported on!
I don't agree with it, but I get it if you want to delete the wave of negative comments about the sponsor that this video is surely getting. However, leaving only the positive comments about the sponsor feels very dystopian and one sided. Why not just disable comments on the video???
They made a Harry Potter game? I'm gonna buy it, I used to love Harry Potter!
I'm here because of the controversy surrounding the sponsor of this video. You're the best Babish, keep doing you man! To all the haters, grow the f**k up.
Are people really getting butthurt about his sponsor? He probably isn't even gonna play the game. The money he gets from the sponsorship will allow him to make more of these videos you love.
Awesome video man. Keep it up.
I love you Babish, this game is a lot of fun and your videos are always amazing!!
Seen you were getting hate for this video and ads so came to like and support. Made another account just to sub twice 🤣🤣
Mate I love your videos but this isn’t a full English.
The new Hogwarts Legacy is so fun to watch. Haven't played it but my boyfriend does. Maybe I'll make an English breakfast and eat it while I watch my bf play lol
Stand strong. Great video.
That look great,  i wish i could try that too lol
Subbed. Due to hate on hogwarts.
Loved your Culinary skills from the basics to advanced videos before my transition and during present day I support you 💯🔥🧡 and there plenty of lgbtq+ folks in my Area that support your goals!!! Keep doing you ☺️☺️ 🧡🧡🧡
I wonder if they served it at Hogwarts?
You just got a new subscriber with me. Liking your channel, and love Hogwarts legacy.
JK Rowling was right
Hogwarts legacy is the most peak rpg I’ve played
Based ad. I bought the game just because I hate Necromorphs.
Don't listen to the people that don't know how to use a restroom... its a great game
I need to make this!
Remember people the only thing actually hurting the trans community is the community itself trying to speedrun becoming the laughingstock of the internet by harassing & threatening people over a videogame
Came here in support of cancelling cancel-culture-culture ✨
Wow that looks really del.... wait.... HARRY POTTER? IM ANGRYYYYYYYYYY
Videos are awesome as always!! Love your content my dude (:
Looks like only the wasteland of Twitter is on their usual cancelling spree. Don’t worry Babish real fans aren’t unsubscribing over a silly advertisement
Love your videos, been watching your videos for a while now. Love the content, it gives me plenty of ideas for new meals.
Thanks for the great video! And the Harry Potter game looks awesome - Maybe I'll buy it for a bunch of kids so they grow up with such a great franchise and such a great creator of that franchise 😊
Hilarious watching the trans activist losers have a meltdown over a video game.
Don't really watch vid like this often but I subscribed just to replace the virtue signalers that left.
I have loved your videos for years and I hope you can ignore idiots hating for any and every reason and keep making wonderful content.
Loved the video!  Also love the fact you're supporting hogwarts legacy!  It's truly an amazing game!
Bunch of soft losers crying over nothing. Always loved the channel. Love it more now
I LOVE HOGWARTS LEGACY!!! 💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
I read an article about how people were unsubbing because of the sponsor of this video.   I have never heard of you before as I don't watch food related videos. But you gained a sub from me today. Don't give in to the loud "woke" voices. Stay true to yourself. Take sponsorships and MAKE THAT MONEY.
Nice ad!
Gross and disappointing that you would promote that game. Oh well the vids have been kinda bad for over a year anyway
Saw a news article where people were upset cause the hogwarts ad and I can't find a single comment about it lol
So, I saw a news article about people complaining about you doing a sponsorship with Warner bros for Hogwarts legacy. The haters are always louder than your fans. I’m usually a silent listener lol but figured I’d pop in and at least look at the comment section. I didn’t come across any hate in the top bit of my comments I don’t feel like scrolling very far. Love your show and keep doin what you’re doin and I’ll keep watchin
Choose better ads
So apparently there were a lot of people that unfollowed babish because he had the ad for Hogwarts Legacy that is so wonderful I read the article it was hilarious
Love you and Hogwarts
Andrew keep up the great food sir and please ignore the haters! Your great!
Based with Babish
Go Harry Potter and JK Rowling!
Here to subscribe and show love for ma boy Andrew.
Just came here to say hogwarts is an awesome game, and if anyone is upset over this ad, the door is open, so please leave.
That looks super tasty!!! I'm going to have to try making that for my wife! Awesome video!
Lol getting all the views. Love hogwarts, it's a great game.
Looks delicious! 👍👍 British cuisine isn't usually my thing but British breakfast is the exception.
Thank you for not being woke
Oh no, they/them are trying to cancel you for the Hogwarts Legacy commercial. 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
I came here for the Hogwarts Legacy commercial! 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Mmm...reminds me of my stay in the UK during a choir competition. Such a lovely experience. English breakfast is wonderful! I missed out on High Tea though. I bought a dress and cute fascinator hat and everything for it. Next time! 😆
Keep it up Babish, love your content ignore the idiots
Great video. I’ve watched you for years. I am sorry that you are caught up in some issue and I’m glad you didn’t remove the video
I was expecting ill comments after reading a Yahoo article that the sponsorship caused a stir, but thankfully I haven't seen any.
Came to subscribe in support of you doing nothing wrong.  This is hilarious.  People are so upset over nothing.  Grow up already people.
So happy to see you not be bullied into a corner, removing the video or apologizing. You're content is great and informative, I have even more respect for you, keep up the great work Andrew 👍
Unsubscribed after years because I don't support those who support the erasure of trans people from society
Terf bs really puts me off of any food, including yours.
i’ll need to try this one more often! and shout out to the sponsor for reminding me to buy the new harry potter game 🙏🏻 congrats on 10 million babish much deserved!
You'd have to be suffering from some kind of self-imposed mental illness if you don't like this video!
Dont worry about the hogwarts haters. They barely have a brain cell to share between the thousands of them
Not a huge fan of full English, but this one looked great!
Just checking in to see this hoohaa with Hogwarts Legacy. And yep, those "fans" supposedly unsubscribing because Babish is apparently supporting a "fascist and transphobe" are definitely just a minority lol. Just Twitter people doing Twitter people stuff. Nothing of value lost really. Those media sites sure loves sensationalizing stuff. Stay cool Babish.
Awesome I love all your work and I’m happy to see a Harry Potter inspired vid. The game is absolutely amazing and incredible don’t listen to the hater’s😄💕♥️⚡️
Delete this one too then. Taking money from fash makes you fash.
Thank you for your support to my favorite game, you won my subscription
I'm sure I don't have to tell you this, you probably have a team of people to do that but here it is anyway. There are extremists from both sides of the spectrum in this comment section. Neither side cares about you. Best not to engage with either and continue making great content like you always have. As soon as a you pick a side you lose.  Also cooked tomatos are the most underrated breakfast food. I dont know why they havent taken off in the US
Don't listen to the haters.
Andrew, you’re a great inspiration to many, thanks for all of the content you put out, keep up the great work, you’ve got all of our support!
Food looks amazing and you gained a new subscriber due to your Hogwarts commercial. For people who left due to it thank you I found a great channel to watch and support.
Thanks yahoo for the recommendation of this fantastic channel!!
Lovely. Full support
Remember a few years ago when anyone who questioned jk Rowling's success was sexist according to the same people who she is now a transphobe to
The game was great. This looked great. Some ppl just hate the truth.
Heard you were catching flak, comment boost and a subscribe. Stand tall.
Love it.  And, sorry about what all the little cry babies are saying about the Harry Potter thing.  If they're offended, you don't need them.
W babish
I’m tryna be a Wizard and eat some bubble and squeek
@AndrewRea - ignore the woke facists who are crying their eyes out over this. We got your back. Stand up against these monsters who want to cancel everything that hurts their feelings.
Y'all don't have black pudding! Missing out
Don't worry about the hate Babish. You are one of the most wholesome people on this platform.
Great video. Great game.
Awesome! Love this! Babish got me intensely involved in cooking and broadening my palate. Thanks for all you do!
Can't have nice things anymore. Cheers, Babby.
Really hope Babish just gets the same outcome as Hogwarts Legacy and ends up having more subscribers because of the cry babies.
Just read a hit piece on you for making this video. Have watched for a long time but decided to subscribe because your work is very enjoyable and you deserve support and not flak. Keep it up.
Unsubscribed immediately. you are a joke for this.
I love Harry Potter and I support trans individuals. It can coexist.
Disappointing
Babish I may have just subbed but don't let these fatherless idiots bring you down
I'm British, we don't usually bother with the bubble and squeak, and the mushrooms should be sliced closed cup mushrooms, and fried eggs should be cooked sunny side up with a runny yolk!
Love you Babish! You did nothing wrong. Liking and playing Hogwarts Legacy does not make you a bad person or anti-trans.
Love your channel please don stop
Totally subbed... all these salty "I'm offended" people. 🤣🤣🤣  Talk about self-created drama...
Love your channel
Howgwarts Legacy ad?  Pass. Bye Babish.
Oh well, guess that's one YouTuber I'm no longer turning off the adblocker for. Shame, liked the channel, but supporting a committed transphobe like Rowling isn't something I want to be supporting.
Babish please don’t listen to those freaks on twitter. They don’t have much to live for anyway so don’t let their comments get to you❤️
It's ridiculous mentally ill men with Autogynephilia want to erase what a woman is. Also them calling people fascists is hilarious while acting in a fascist mindset.
Long time follower. Disappointed to see you promoting a game with a virulently antisemitic plot. A lot less interested in watching in the future.
Based with babish, subbed ever since I saw your every meat burrito video and I still am
Babish, I fully enjoy all the videos you make. I just subscribed!
Americans are funny. No one calls them bangers and no one has bubble and squeak with a fry up. Haha
Lol I just read an article saying people are unfollowing you because you took an ad for Hogwarts legacy. Glad to see you only have love in your comments. Great stuff dude. Full English is my favorite but man is it a heart attack waiting to happen if you eat a full English every day
I STILL SUPPORT BABISH!!!
Awesome stuff, I've never heard of your channel before an article about the potter nonsense. Glad I did, you have a new fan!
Thank you for entertaining us Andrew, don't listen to those haters
I wish i could thumbs-up this twice!  Love it -- Babish is the best
That looks delicious. The game is super fun, I love ur videos
I started making my breakfast with an english twist a little bit back after seeing Joshua Weissman's english breakfast video. Glad to see Babish do his take on it, as always its another amazing video.
Subbed specifically to replace the woke twitter douches
New subscriber. This was fantastic, though the smell of cooked cabbage can be rough.
This looks amazeballs 🤤
Turn this reply section to a Twitter argument
Thanks Babish for all the work and effort you do to bring us these videos as well as all those you work with I appreciate it it has given me many tips and ideas for cooking for me and my wife don't let the muggles get you down they just don't like magic
Came to sub after seeing all the snowflakes crying on Twitter
Canola oil literally kills people and feeds tumors twice as fast as nut oils and animal fats. Research omega-6-3 ratio in oils and their relation to cancer
You always manage to make the best looking food.
Trans people father's be like: I'm going to get the milk
I like Babish, Harry Potter, and Hershey's. Don't let the Twitter facists get you down!
I read in the newspaper them SJWs is tryna cancel you. I hate video games but you have my support
Luv u babz
Don't let the trolls get ya down! Great video, looks delicious!
Disappointed that you decided to advertise on the behalf of the Harry Potter game.
Awesome episode. Gave you a new subscriber to help offset the couple people that think they are better than everyone else.
Where'd you get the English blood sausage in the states? I've tried to find it here but haven't had any luck. Other blood sausage like Argentinian just doesn't have the same great consistency that I had remember tasting in the UK.
GET THAT TERF MONEY BABISH, U 🤡
Saw the nonsense cancel crowd come for you over a video game. Hadn't heard of you before but here to support now. They like twisting words and getting angry over it. They're gonna lose this battle.
Oh no babish the snowflakes who hate jk Rowling are going to get mad because your supporting a game that has nothing to do with her.
Hogwarts Legacy look so cool
Should call this a Full Babish instead. :v
I'm here, liking and subscribing to help tip the scales back. You should use their tears to boil something in.
Love the video!! 🙌Don't cave to the haters. Keep up the amazing work! You should make some butterbeer! ^^
Came for the comments. Where’d they go? 😂
Loving this video and sponsor. I think I will donate.
Been watching Babish for a long time, since the first SpongeBob episode came out. Great guy with great content! Don't let the Twitter drama spoil what makes this channel great. People forget that different opinions and views don't make the "opposition" evil. Wouldn't the world be dreadfully boring if we all agreed on everything?   Keep it up you glorious (I'm guessing) Hufflepuff!
Great video!
As someone who is english, I can confirm we eat this every single morning.
Looks great!! Thanks!
Lol I subbed because ppl were crying like sick babies about the Hogwarts adverts.  💜💜💜💜💜Aaah mental illness. The breakfast looks 🔥 of course.
I love you Andrew. Ignore these righteously indignant cave trolls.
Love the video, and I’m sorry some of your fanbase has left because you want to get paid to keep doing these videos
Subbed because of the unnecessary hate.
You almost NEVER see over easy eggs here, hash browns are way more common that bubble and squeak, the back bacon should be waaaay more crispy, and usually big tomato slices are used like in the american version. Still looks amazing though!
I definitely wanna try to make it now, looks delicious. Also I found your channel because of all the hate articles over the sponsorship on this video. I'm subscribed now and glad to have found this channel.....I'm here for the food and could care less about who you advertise for.
Ik subbed to support you and the add , love poeple with a backbone Don't give in to the haters 👍
Blood Libel wit Babish
Loved the video and like the sponsor
I subbed to support the channel! Ignore the cyber bullies!
That's the kind of breakfast I'd love to wake up to ❤
Oh no! You upset the LGBT Mafia!
Just subscribed to support the channel. Ignore the haters, they never watched your channel before. And never say you're sorry to them ever.
Honestly this just makes me support the channel more.
Extremely disappointed dude. That game is paying transphobes and is antiseptic.
Love your videos!!
understanding the political impact of supporting JK Rowling is also inaccessible to most Americans, apparently
Just heard about this Babish guy from the news, heard he is getting canceled. So I'm here to do my duty and give a like and subscribe.
Unsubscribed because of the paid sponsor. I don’t know your paid sponsor situation but this is one where I don’t feel comfortable supporting you anymore. Best of luck I future endeavors.
Imagine unsubscribing from a great cooking YouTuber all because of a game that was made by people who are not correlated with the original creator of the source material all because of something they said YEARS after they wrote the book. Please continue malding, it’s  Entertaining
I support Babish, Hogwarts Legacy, and J.K. Rowling, thank you!
Never liked a video so fast.
Love this, love full English and your work!
I've always wanted to know what an English breakfast entailed
Hogwarts Legacy is awesome!
Harry Potter and Babish, subbed!
Great youtuber, thanks for not giving into cyberbullying
There's absolutely no way. No one has said anything about the Hogwarts thing
sometimes I seriously consider going camping or something with a lot of activity while eating barely anything for a day. Just so I could completely enjoy a breakfast like this the next day.
I've been here since the beginning (prison sauce) ...have the cookbook etc.   I also love HP books and movies - got us through my sisters' chemo and such.  This controversy is ridiculous.  Andrew has nothing, but love in his heart.  So many people worked on that game outside Rowling.  Should they be punished for her intellectual property?  This is such BS.
Great video Babish! Love watching you do your thing man! Perfect breakfast for a day off filled with potions and spell-slinging :)
I identify as a velociraptor and I’m offended
Love the vid and the breakfast ❤️
Man's just made an amazing breakfast. Be who you be, don't worry about others my Man. Hate breeds Hate!!!
Anyone who’s watched YouTube has come across this man and his delicious recipes. It blows my mind how intolerant those who once advocated for tolerance have become. I’m not a big cooking show type of guy but he deserves a follow.
Great content.  Also, subscribed to counter the unfair treatment you've received.
I stand with Babish. Don't cancel this man
Gained a subscriber
Keep doing what you do Babish, ignore the trolls. They wake up looking for something to hate as soon as their eyes open.
why did you do this sponsor?
Subscribed because I read about you doing a Hogwarts Legacy ad.
I can’t believe twitter’s reaction to this vid. They are softies and make no sense!
You can't just delete all the comments criticizing you and then move on like you're not choosing to take a stand for transphobia and antisemitism. Was the bag really worth it?
I've never unsubscribed to a channel faster after only watching one second of a video.
You know what you're doing here and it's honestly disgusting. Transphobia and antisemitism are never okay.
Why is it called an English breakfast? British breakfast has added alliteratuve appeal.
I wish I could subscribe ten times!!
Read a Yahoo article (I know, who the heck reads Yahoo news) about fans unsubscribing from Babish because of the sponsor of this video. Glad to come here and see nothing but regular old comments from all the Babish fans.
“You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”
Dont know why ppl are bugging on babish. Leave your ignorance at the door about H.L game. It's all about the breakfast man. Plus jk has no ties to game period and makes no money from it.
Great work as always!! Will be recreating myself. And for future reference you can sponsor whatever you want I will remain here. We don't have to agree all the time but we're humans and at the end of it all no one is right lol.
nearly 700k views! congrats guys another successful boycott 🤡
Why is twitter blowing up because of a game not even made by the author it makes absolutely zero sense
Don't bow to the vocal minority. Hogwarts Legacy is a great game. JK Rowling is not transphobic. You are doing nothing wrong. People are crazy and desperate don't let them get you down.
Saw an article about how this channel was losing subscribers due to this paid sponsorship. As such, I had to check it out, and you've got a new subscriber.
I'm kinda shocked there are absolutely no angry comments on this video.
Heard about some controversy and instantly came here to subscribe and watch this video.
I subscribed. A man should be able to endorse a video game. Jk just tells the truth.
Just started following you because all of the bad press and cancel culture fury. Never would have heard of you without the woke mob trying to silence anyone who disagrees with them. Way to stick to your guns. Wishing you the very best.
Babish you absolutely deserve the success that you have. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Hogwarts Legacy FTW
When I arrived in Ireland for my cousin's wedding, I was introduced to a similar breakfast at our hotel. First time trying blood sausage, I asked for seconds. It was AMAZING to me! Edit...I grew up in Boston, we have the tradition of corned beef, cabbage and Colcannon or Champ. Mushrooms, tomatoes and anything that makes your tummy smile😊 Don't forget lots of Irish butter. Preferably, Kerrygold. I can't wait to see your spin on a traditional Saint Paddy's day dinner💚
Wow, yikes. That's disappointing
Well, I wasn't hungry when I started this video...
you should do the family dinner from shrek 2!!
Hogwarts Legacy brought me here. The food is making me stay. Hogwarts Legacy is literally one of the greatest games created. I don't care who it is connected to. I'm glad this channel has revelio'd itself to me...  =)
Love the Sponsor!!!
Bangers and Mash, I named my character in Hogwarts Legacy, Mash Bangers.
Deleting the negative comments doesn't get rid of the backlash for agreeing to take money for a TERF.
Great video!
Great video as usual! A really great sponsor for this video too!
Hi, to my jk Rowling hating people.  I'm supporting this because you threw a fit and wrote an article about how this hurt your feelings.  Now I'm here watching it, to spite you.  The beauty of all this is that you can't control me, you can't shame, and best of all, you can't stop me.  Now, quit obsessing about controlling the world and what others think.  Let it go and do something more fruitful. This line of protest has failed. Maybe go help the needy and less fortunate than you.  Find some humility and realize self autonomy means we make our own decisions and enjoy our own lives regardless of others.  If you wish to spite me, go be happy, stop wasting your life on things you can't control.
Love this man's show. He deserves all the success he's had.
Love this video and love your ad at the beginning, the game looks amazing
Here & subscribed because I read the LGHDTV+ community was upset about your Hogwarts Legacy ad. Fantastic game btw!
Hogwarts brought me here! Amazing game and your videos are awesome. New fan for sure. Like and subscribed!
I logged online first to an ad denouncing Babish for supporting “that” wizard game and noting that many have unsubscribed.   First: Thank you for doing your thing.  Second: Thank you for being great as usual.  I will go buy your cookbook lol.
Don't listen to the hate and seriously never give in to the voice of the "mob".  I don't think anyone who has really watched you would think you do anything with malicious intent.  Also going to buy a copy of the game just to further irritate these folks that hate for the sake of hating.
I just read an article about controversy over the HP ad. Grow up people, it’s ok to be offended, you don’t have to cancel someone because you don’t agree with their views. I’m sick of this culture of “if you’re left you’re right, if you’re right you’re wrong.”
Love your content.....
Never been to the UK, but I love a full English breakfast. 😋 Pretty sure what they sell in Texas can't compare.
So this is the video everyone is mad about.  English breakfast looks like a Filipino breakfast if you just add fried rice.
Love your stuff man! This video especially, can't wait to try it out.
the fact people are disliking this over the sponsor is actually pathetic. its a video game. grow up.
I came here because of a yahoo news article shaming this man's hustle. I see this man has no worries.
I came here and subbed because someone wrote a dumb article about you losing subs due to this video being transphobic. Glad I found you, I love food and this video is awesome.
Unsubbed. I used to think you were a man of integrity. I thought wrong.
Looks fantastic!!!
I see a bunch of woke people made a stink about the Hogwarts Legacy ad. All I can say is that these hateful SJWs should get over it.
Where was all this negative energy when he made three other Harry Potter related videos?? I guess they hadn’t finished building the bandwagon yet 🥱
I can't wait to play HL when it releases. Already pre-ordered! 🙌
Just subscribed after seeing an article implying Social Media is upset that this creator is a Harry Potter fan.
Watching this just to counteract the haters
Love your vids and hate the cancel culture. Glad to see the hate doesn't influence your statistics in any way. If you look at twitter you rly get the wrong impression that most people ride that hate-train. But I guess they are just the loudest, not the most.
Great video as always! Keep up the great work! ✌️
Love these recipes bro!!!!
Love your content.
I watch your videos occasionally but wasn't subscribed, after seeing the alphabet group throwing a tantrum over the channel being sponsored by A VIDEO GAME I decided to subscribe 😁
Here to support Babish. Hogwarts Legacy is great and is not related in anyway to anti Trans sentiments.
I'm here to give a like and view to this video for the hogwarts haters :)
Stand your ground against the screaming Twitter mob.  If you give them an inch, they will demand a mile.  They might be loud, but they are very few.
Twitter wierdo said to cancel you we say nay
Here as a woman to support you, thank you for the choice you made ❤️
Subscribed along with everyone else to show support. It’s a video game people, not trans genocide.
Subscribed just to support Harry!
So delicious!  I subscribed and got everyone I know to subscribe, just because he wasn't afraid to support a Harry Potter game. Don't let the trolls scare you away!
Subscribed, it's recipes y'all, not political.
As long as this remains up i will resubscribe. dont let the bullies win.
it's hilarious because everyone on here is so chill but Twitter is burning itself to the ground about this video. enjoy your English breakfast lads.
Awesome video!! And hogwarts legacy has been super fun!
I’m subscribing to your channel simply due to the discrimination you’re facing from the Left.
Can you do Sugar Mama’s “get up and go bars” from the proud family?? 😂❤
if you are going to boycott a youtuber who took money from a company that produces a game that was designed after a movie that was made from a book that was written by a terrible person ... then you have many more degrees of separation to look at in order to truly understand how to avoid toxicity
I'm trying to gain weight and this would be perfect!    There is an astonishing amount of seething in the comments, I invite you to touch some grass.
Remember one thing, you’re a hypocrite if you shop at Target, Walmart, Barnes and Noble, Best Buy, GameStop, Amazon, or use Twitter. You can’t call this man out while shopping at these places. 😂😂
Money isn't everything....  Live and let live....
These comments are incredible. Y'all some delusional m'fers lol
People are really getting out of control with this Harry Potter boycott against JK. I won’t support a group of people who rage against someone whose views are not damaging at all. Go learn real facts instead of following like a blind sheep. All that hate is childish. You people are why the world keeps perpetuating so much hate.
Don’t let people pressure you.
👍🏼
If you are freaking out over his sponsor, I want you to know that there is absolutely no way you can ever not buy something that doesn’t align with your views.   It’s a video game ffs. He’s charged you nothing over the years. Get over yourself.
Just subscribed.  Never heard of you before but looking forward to checking your content out.  Thanks crybabies!
No group as delusional and fragile as the T's
Thank you babish, please do not apologize or pull the hogwarts legacy ad!
Well, that's strike one of two.
Kinda disappointed by the choice of Hogwarts Legacy as a sponsor, NGL. I know it probably doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things but I'd rather Andrew not be giving even tangential support to JK's transphobia and the game's antisemitism.
Hogwarts is a really great game. I support you Babish
I'm here to support Babish.
Hugely disappointing guys. And to delete comments expressing disappointment as if they were harassment? Hope the money was worth it
Wow I didn't realize Binging with Babish was so transphobic.  RIP to Babish's career.
Looks great Babish! Ignore the hatters!
Hey babish, Im a trans fan of your work and seeing you choose the paycheck here really sucks. extremely disapointed.
Imagine Getting "genuinely" disappointed and then started Malding over a YouTuber getting sponsored by a game you dislike
Aaaaand liked. Commented. Shared. Subscribed for a long time
Aaaand unsubscribed.
Would be way better without the bad wizard game. Disappointed.
Based Babish!
I see the lovely people of Twitter found this video
Idk how I feel about helping the TERF. Maybe you should donate to a Trans charity
Trans right activists is a hate group.
Murmuration again W
cope, seethe, and dilate. JKR was right. YWNBAW
👎
Lots of fake users commenting nonsense going on here. I refuse to believe that _so many_ people are brainwashed enough to actually dislike a video for Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship, they HAVE to be bots.
KIA brought me here.
boooooo
Need you to know I immediately closed the video when I saw the HP sponsorship, and this is the thing that will make me unsubscribe. HP Legacy and JK Rowling are pouring a ton of money into marketing this game to drown out the trans people who are actively harmed by every single dollar Rowling gets, and she's said that herself. Every royalty she gets goes to trans hate groups. I know you guys have decisions in this.
Gotta admit, I'm both really surprised and terribly heartbroken to see the BCU team "crossing the picket-lines" as it were to accept money from incredibly problematic sources.   I genuinely thought better of y'all.
Liking and commenting to show you my support for your video and your video sponsor :) Always loved watching your cooking videos!
TTD
Reading these comments over I was a little disturbed to find out where the blood for the sausage came from, but it's another culture, I cannot judge.
Love to see you working with Hogwarts Legacy! Awesome, fun stuff!
Twitter freaks coping :)
PIKAMEE’S BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS, TROONS
Oh no.   Oh nonononoonono  Nooooo  Stahp!
seems like lots of people are getting mad over nothing here
TRANS BLOOD IS ON YOUR HANDS, ANDREW
More like Binging with Bigots
I've been watching your channel for awhile. But seeing this mob of disgusting hateful bigoted incel basement dwellers try to brigade you for taking on a simple sponsor has made me subscribe to you, then go through all your videos and hit the like button. I think people are finally getting sick of these "people" and their pathetic, impotent rage mobs.
kinda stunned to see you promoting Hogwarts Legacy given the recent words & actions of J.K. rowling...many of our trans friends and siblings have asked us to please not engage with this game or its content. Babish you have 10M subscribers and i'm sure you get zillions of ad offers...why not choose one that doesn't support a transphobic bigoted creator & an antisemitic videogame about blood libel?
Jesus christ these comments are insufferable
i really need to find a way to get black pudding! i miss it so much
binging with babish
Congrats on your most watched video? 😂
JUSTICE FOR PIKAMEE
Blood sausage is amazing. It’s tradition here in French Canada.
W Hogwarts Legacy
Wow a Hogwarts legacy sponsor and the comments aren’t a war zone?!
Wow a Hogwarts legacy sponsor and the comments aren’t a war zone?!
Oh, that's disappointing to see the woman fighting to make sure I can't exist in the UK is making money from this video
i sincerely expected better from this channel, but this sponsorship is honestly embarrassing.
Never go full English.
yeah like others have said, the hash brown if far more likely than bubble and squeak. to the point that i didnt even know bubble and squeak was a fry up item, we always knew it as a roast left-overs dish in our house.
nice job deleting all the critical comments instead of owning up to the fact that you supported a transpobic, antisemitic, racist game
The bubble and squeak recipe of Babish’s British breakfast is more akin to the Irish potato cake! am I right my Irish cousins?
bit disapointed by the support of Hogwarts legacy.
Funny how the community that wants to be accepted and respected is so intolerant towards other don't you think?
This sponsorship was pretty disappointing. I’ve been a fan for years, but seeing how you’re willing to pick money over trans lives and selling a product with blatant antisemitism leaves me no choice but to unsubscribe. I urge anyone else reading this to do the same.
I just subscribed because you were sponsored by hogwarts legacy.
I've followed you for years, but thanks for telling me that you care more about a sponsorship supporting a bigot, than my very existence. Love to see it.
Very disappointed in you babish. I’ve been subscribed for years but I’m not messing with the Harry Potter stuff, I have too many people I care about to justify supporting you supporting them. I hope you reconsider.
5:47 that spatula is so cute!
Celcius? That's weird. You're making a Imperialist breakfast whilst being an American in America. You should be using that funky Fahrenheit! 😛
It's time for Tranimaniacs! They're disgusting to the max!
hogwarts legacy sponsor😐
man that is a bit too heavy looking of a breakfast for me, but it still really all came together by the end!! love your vids and your channel 🙌 keep up the great work!
Thanks for choosing a based sponsor, Babish. Troons seethe and dilate.
Instant unfollow after years of support. Unfathomably disappointed that you’ve decided to take money from an IP whose creator has had no shortage of publicity for her antisemitism and transphobia.
Man, come on. Surely you're making enough money to not accept this sponsorship and surely you're savvy enough to know the genuine harm in taking one from this franchise. Do better.
Canadian bacon isn't simply ham, is it? I haven't had it in forever since it was on pizza in my younger days.
I've been subscribed to Babish with my partners for the last several years, but I'm disappointed in the explicitly anti-trans and antisemitic game sponsorship as someone who is nonbinary with a trans partner. Wishing you the best in your endeavors Babish, but my household is no longer going to be subscribed or watching your videos. This hurts to see, dude.
Disappointed in the choice to promote an antisemitic game. I've loved these videos and they have helped me so much with healing my relationship to food.  The issues with this games have been explained so much everywhere online, there isn't an excuse to not know.  Loved the channel and sad to say goodbye
Thanks for making it clear that supporting you for YEARS was a waste because you can't walk away from a dollar bill even if it means ostracizing your trans and Jewish fans.  Trans lives matter. I hope you figure that out.
Oh.
man u dont put mashed tatoes on the grill u stoopid 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
From the comments section, seems there are a lot of people who would think Charmin would even feel like granite all because of a very VERY popular game. I can imagine that NONE of the people complaining have any items manufactured in China where a certain group is basically illegal. Better start checking the tags on everything, because otherwise you are all hypocrites.
Why does the trans community think they’re the supreme authority of what’s right or wrong?
Unsubscribed. So tired of bigotry and antisemitism being ignored for profit.
People getting this riled up by a video game is nothing less than I expected from 2023.
Very disappointed you chose to accept sponsorship from a game that encourages horrible stereotypes about Jewish people and puts money into the pocket of person that hates trans people.
By choosing to accept Warner Bros sponsorship from the new Hogwarts game, you've decided trans lives and Jewish lives are unimportant to you. I hope you change in the future, but I cannot watch your content because you choose hatred.
Pretty disappointed that you'd take money from WB to sling that game.
A small bit disappointed that he took the sponsorship from hogwarts legacy.
I always love a full english breakfast and try to make one at least once a week!
You see it's not only that he took a sponsorship for hogwarts legacy,but now his comment section is essentially a safe space for anti semites and transphobes
BROOOOOOO...... bubble and queak is made with left overs 🤦. It's not on a full English 😭😭
It's telling, it really is, when someone not only takes a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy but also deletes all the comments surrounding the controversy. It hurts, as someone who really used to love this channel and had been subscribed for years. Its also telling how all the transphobic comments are getting a ton of likes.
jesus christ, hogwarts legacy? *really* babish?? thought you were better than this honestly and it makes me sad
Supporting Hogwarts legacy? Come on babish.
Surprised to see this sponsor on this channel.  I sincerely hope it doesn't continue.
honestly it’s disappointing that you guys took the sponsorship money from the hogwarts game
YOU ARE JUST LIKE ANDREW TATE
Cool video!
Wow. I thought you were better than this. Welp
oh he genuinely doesn't care, huh
You must learn the lesson I hope the gaming industry has learnt with this game and that is: ignore the hyoocrits who claim to have more morals than you, yet who still bought and played the game. These people's complaints are silly and quite frankly unfounded, and it screams of bad actors who don't care about what they claim to care about. Cancel culture at it's finest.
Look at these keyboard warriors acting like they wouldn't take money from a well selling game  Acting like their "morals" would last an offer of money Keep on coping
babish bigot moments
>literally allowing yourself to be sponsored by Hoggie Warts: The Reddit Game About Transphobic Apologia
I'm probably just screaming into the void... but as a creator I usually really respect, I was pretty disappointed to see that you took this sponsorship with Hogwarts Legacy given the known transphobia and racism of JK Rowling. She will profit from the success of this video game and likely continue to donate that money to anti trans groups and legislation. I hope you might consider donating the money you made off of the sponsorship to LGBTQ+ or Trans led organizations to offset the harm done to this community
Based sponsorship!
Just wanna say Babish thank you for all of the great content you put out. I loved this video, blood sausage is my absolute favorite! Dont listen to all the internet weirdos. We're here for you! See ya next time!
12k dislikes, woof. deserved though
New Satanic panic just dropped
I'm Canadian, and we don't call that...what ever it is, Canadian Bacon. That's ham.
Oh noes Babish, you just made the Looney Troons really angry. Do better, next time pick a less based sponsor! Thanks.
Been subbed to this channel for a while now, I tried two recipes and my family loved them, this sponsorship won't change that. Stay chill and keep on going bro these people are just terminally online and don't care about us women.
I held an audible gasp from the moment you plated the breakfast at first until 4:18, outraged that I did not see hashbrowns.
Garlic has absolutely NO place in an English breakfast. Not even a Colonial version ;)
Oh that looks great!
A W of a sponsorship if I've ever seen one and a fantastic vid as always, Babish! Keep it going!
Unfollowed, we don’t support JK Rowling around here.
At least now we know where this channel stands on LGBT+ issues
Unfortunately unsubscribing. I cannot support someone who willingly affiliates themselves with that game and franchise. Trans and Jewish lives and safety will always be more important. It’s disappointing to see polite critical comments get deleted as well.
W sponsorship
Babish, I'm disappointed in you. Despite everything that's come to light about J.K., including the knowledge that she makes money from the game and will donate said money to hate groups, you still chose to advertise this game if it meant lining your own pockets. After how much you seem to be phoning it in lately, this is the last straw for me as a trans person. I find it despicable that you would choose money over morals in any scenario, but it's especially hurtful when it's in a way that causes money to go to groups that actively want people like me dead.  Do better, Babish. I know you're capable of it.
The comments here compared to the nonsensical woke cry-bullying and uber-moralising of the sponsor on Instagram are infinitely different, more mature and mentally stable. Another brilliant video!
Don't estrange your fan base challenge
Dayum Babish, if you’re hurting for money so bad that you gotta promote a transphobic, antisemitic video game, you should have just told us!
not the hogwarts legacy sponsorship
It makes me really sad that you are promoting Hogwarts Legacy.
Cishet content creators will never not end up disappointing.
the Americanized version looks more like a standard full English breakfast than the first one.
Fried Bread is bread deep fried in oil not just toasted on a griddle
man it sucks to see someone you admire sell out for an anti-semitic, transphobic dumpster fire of a game. you're way too rich to justify this sponsorship and it isn't even a HP themed thing it's just "english food"
Disappointed. Unsubscribing. You made a very deliberate choice here, and I dont believe for a second that you did so unknowingly.
wow what a classic british breakfast! its even sponsored by garbage!
These comments blaming babish for being transphobic are the same kinds of people that would say video games cause violence and shootings. Truly being terminally online has damaged these things
It is incredibly disappointing to see you taking money to hawk JKRs wizard game. I find it very difficult to believe you aren't aware of the author's hateful anti-trans rhetoric, but in case you don't understand, she is a billionaire, attacking a vulnerable minority group, and she continues to influence policy and make money from her IP to this day. She then uses her continued success to justify the righteousness of her bigoted beliefs. Come on, Andrew.
Pretty lame that the person in charge of your comments is deleting comments expressing their disappointment and disgust. Not very mature at all. Mega MEGA disappointed in the entire channel.
Yall gonna address the sponsorship issue or nah
Can't believe my favorite cooking channel is getting review bombed over a decent game as a whole and an overall wonderful Harry Potter experience.  Love your vids man, just ignore the crazies.
Im so dissapointed in you Babbish I thought you were better than to accept a sponsorship such as this im deeply saddened
Unsubbed. Downvoted. Deleting comments and ignoring fan backlash? Shameful. Expected better from Babish.
This ain't it dude
Ok Babish u gotta make sure the eggs are sunny side up, doing them over easy is a crime and 2 toast and 3 halfed roasted tomatoes, also if u were to do it Aussie style u gotta have the toast buttered and then Vegemite
So ur telling me that Canadian bacon is just sliced ham?
I just love how y'all people think that humans even have morals to begin with. Don't emotionally attach to some person you see on your screens. Make real connection.
really, really, disappointed to see the sponsor of this one. totally missed the mark, I'm afraid.
Unsubbed :) all of my friends and family have as well. Do better.
I'm unsubbing and taking WB's money to promote Hogwarts Legacy is why. I expected better.
Unsubscribed because of that ad. Sad to see someone sell their morals for a quick buck.
beyond disappointed about the sponsorship & removing any mentions of it. everyone disappoints eventually :/
after seeing the sponsored game i’m unsubscribing is it really that hard to do the base level allyship for trans people?
I can't believe babish is a transphobe, that breaks my heart
cool way to show you care more about money than trans people. unsubscribed
Oh it's just lovely to see you guys vetting and deleting any criticism of your decisions, really speaks for you!
Fried bread is the greatest contribution to society that England ever gave.
Disappointed in you for taking a sponsorship from Hogwarts legacy
Disappointed by the sponsorship. I’ll watch other videos, but not this one. Especially when babish seems like a generally aware person that he wouldn’t be ignorant or unaware of the harm that JKR causes in the LGBTQ+ communities. I wish you valued trans lives more than this check. Especially given that this has come out well after the game and backlash many people experienced about playing, you can’t feign ignorance. 😔 Do better.  (Edited to correct babish misspelled due to autocorrect)
Dear twitter, thank you for the backlash on this channel. Without it I would have never found this great content creator and his tortilla chip guacamole hat.
cringing with babish amirite
Please do an Ulster Fry next, so much better than a full english
My man it sucks that you took the transphobia money and it also sucks you're deleting comments calling you out for it. Grow a pair.
You take TERFs money, I unsubscribe, byebye
Petition for Babish to make Powdered Donut Pancake Surprise from South Park
he fell off harder than his hair
Sad to know you don't stand w trans people Babish
Bubble and squeak is not part of the fry up, it is a meal of its own. Black pudding is much darker and thicker generally and it is rare we flip our fried eggs, try again!!
Welp, this is gonna be another one for the Botched By Babish series
Babish. Why did you and your team accept a sponsorship from a game that the ip creator sees as supporting of her transphobia? Especially when the antisemitism and racism of her and her work, especially this game, have been called out.  Have you hated these groups? Or do you just refuse to research.
I'm disappointed you guys are avoiding criticism regarding who this video is for. I'm also avoiding using possibly filtered words in the hopes this actually shows up.
Binging with Babish and the Chamber of Deleted Comments
Yum
Now get Gordon Ramsay to taste it
It makes me so sad to see Babish supporting and promoting Hogwarts Legacy. No one can pretend not to know about JK Rowlings views anymore so it sucks to see
can you make pho please?:)
Bubble and squeak is a leftovers meal, also as a Yorkshire lass, eggy bread and tinned Tom's for the win.
mfs be telling trans people to off themselves in the comments and then turn around and call them the bullies lol.
She’s living rent free in so many peoples heads…love it
that sponsored game looks fun, i'm gonna buy a copy
Yeah gotta unsub for that one chief
Quite dissapointed by this one. Bubble and squeak is not in a traditional big breakfast.  Also very disappointed in the H0gwarts L3gacy promo. I expect better from you.
Very disappointed to see you support hogwarts legacy, definitely unsubscribing
supporting TERFs...... cringe.
Fantastic video! Looking forward to the next one — I’m a new subscriber!!
Hey man. Bad look supporting that game in particular.
babish potter embarrassment
DUDE DUDE MAKE THE 99-CHEESE PIZZA FROM TMNT! 🐢💙🐢💜🍕🍕🍕🐢❤️🐢🧡
jk is going to take yhe money you make her to actively hurt trans people and fund right wing politicians in the uk, you guys usually do a lot of reasearch it's pretty disappointing to see this from you guys. Please listen to trans people.
This game is fueling concentration camps for the transgender I cannot believe you I thought you were a decent cis hetero man but no  you are becoming a dictator that will negatively effect the trans allies!!!!!
Really, you took their sponsorship $$?
The fact that you guys are trying to hide comments about people sharing their legitimate concerns is super disappointing. So long.
I'd like to suggest the sweets from Amadeus, the Capezzoli di Venere and the mascapone pudding. Pretty pretty please?
Dude this looks delicious.
I subscribed because of the hogwarts legacy advertisement tbh
Hogwarts Legacy rules! love the english breakfast too!🥳🥳🥳 J.K. Rowling is right about everything!!! 💯
so are u gonna stop using kosher salt after promoting the anti-semitic wizard game or...?
Been watching your channel since the beginning, and I have one of your trivets in my kitchen (and it's a well-made trivet!), and I have to say- I'm not crazy about you plugging the money pile of a transphobic billionaire.
disappointed babish would betray his lgbtq+ - specifically trans - viewers like this by supporting/being supported by anything harry potter. rowling has specifically said she sees any sort of support for hp as support for her TERF views.... i am sure there are other sponsors he could've gone with, and choosing this one over anything else is sending a message...
Any other Canadians come here to say that is NOT Canadian bacon as Canadians know it? We eat peameal or back bacon like the UK version you did, not weird processed looking ham rounds
:(
10 million subscribers and you accept ad money from a terf for her thoroughly antisemitic game? Pretty disappointed, I'm not gonna lie. I really thought better of you
41 is my new favorite number thank you to everyone in the comments who had made it my new favorite number
I don't know what to say... Why would you accept money from Hogwarts Legacy when you know full well the harm it and it's creators have targeted against the trans and Jewish communities... Sad to see you stoop to this
Literally disgusted you would put this video out. How much damage have you done Babish? I don't think you even know. I used to watch your videos religiously and now I can barely stand to look at you. I'm sure you guessed what this is about, Bubble and Squeak? REALLY?!?!?!?!11one.
This is not so far off, try and get your hands on some Stornaway black pudding, don’t fry the eggs to death and no fancy tomatoes, just use normal toast with plenty butter also. A full English is supposed to be quite greasy, disgusting and a great cure for a strong hangover! 😅
I can't believe you took money from that game. Shame on you.
Can you do Monty's coconut cream cake from A Series of Unfortunate Events
Are you wearing an expensive watch? ,Just wandering
bye bye little pooners and hons, nobody will miss you, not even your parents who will write your deadname on your tombstone when you finally 41 over hogwarts legacy 2
extremely disappointed to see you accepting a sponsorship from a game like this. unsubscribed. Do Better.
Babish, if you're reading this, then I urge you not to take back the sponsor or feel the need to apologize to these people.  They're a very vocal minority from Twitter who can't seem to separate art from the artist. Discrediting the hard work of hundreds involved with the development of Hogwart's Legacy because of ONE PERSON who had little to no involvement with it's creation. Whether you agree with JK Rowling or not is besides the point, but following this logic would mean having to disavow A LOT of things we enjoy, just because of who made it, including many of the foods/dished you've made before on this channel.  So keep up your chin up, stand your ground, and don't let a bunch of "bullies" from the bird app tell you otherwise.
Jeez the dislikes. Seems a portion of the internet is still assmad about Hogwarts Legacy.
That's really delicious recipes 😋😋 thanks for sharing your  delicious recipes video 👍😊
Very disappointing.
Really hurtful that this was made, given the harm JK Rowling has done to trans people. Not to mention the racism sprinkled throughout HP. I hope there's some kind of gesture made to make this right.
It's a game yet they somehow got emotionaly damaged just by seeing its name. amazing.
Beautiful video and a great tutorial. Don’t listen to the haters, bub. Those perpetually online folks just need someone to shout at to feel like their existence is validated.
Infact the American one is much more like what you’d see in British cafes, swapping the round bacon for black pudding or similar
Authenticity ruined immediately. Bubble and squeak is never on a full English
Can you make the cheesecake from FRIENDS, please?
I love the full English and this video. I want to see Babish revisit the Timpano with everything that he's picked up over the years. See if he make it better. Or if you don't want to do a total recreation, a stream or compilation video of babish reviewing his older videos looking back on how cars he's come.
To the troons are mad over some video game . Cry more.
transgender people must prosper
Flipping over the fried egg felt very un full English
Real jump scare on the advertisement there
Now I am going to spend all my money on hogwarts legacy to support transphobia. Thanks.
i'm surprised and disappointed to see the sponsor for this video, so i'm choosing to respectfully voice that. hope the Babish team will consider their partnerships more carefully.
This ain't it.  Edit: I'm not saying there's something inherently wrong with British food. I'm saying that Babish has not produced a "full English" correctly.
thought you would be better than this man. been a fan for a long time, really disappointing. unsubbed
Disappointed but unfortunately not surprised. Taking the sponsorship and advertising the game is one thing I and so many others are not in support of, but deleting comments providing valid criticism and information is completely disrespectful and intentionally ignorant. I've watched this channel for years, but I think the time has come for me to unsubscribe.
Make some cheesy garlic bread
One voice among many, but as a trans former follower your acceptance of a sponsorship from a game that funds transphobia and centres on a not-even-veiled antisemitic plot line is not cool and I won’t be continuing to follow. Educate yourself and do better.  Also, Rockwood cursed Anne and your professor dies in every ending.
Troons seething so hard in the comments. Are they upset because they are banned from within 100 feet of the local playground?
as a long time trans fan, the sponsorship was disappointing. jkr has said she sleeps well at night being transphobic because of the royalties she earns from harry potter related things.
must be doing a LOT of pruning to keep the TERF-sponsorship backlash from sitting at the top of your comments. shame on you for taking money from this BS game.
Very disappointed as a trans person
why are you deleting comments calling you out for openly supporting a transphobe when you know you dont need the money huh?
look at the like and dislike ratio.
Imagine accepting a sponsorship from someone actively trying to erase an entire subculture. Disgusting. Be better.
Looking at the newest comments and seeing all the losers throwing a fit over the sponser is the peak of entertainment
Crazy disappointed to see you take money to promote that game.
Hogwarts Legacy has been cracked already, piracy stays winning. I already torrented it and besides having to go into ini files to change the language if you’re not on English it’s perfect.
disapointed in the sponsor
I wanna see an Alice in Wonderland special I'm pretty sure there were a lot of different dishes shown throughout the movie and the second one to
Troons malding over Hogwarts Legacy here.
Imagine him collating with HowToBasic  💀💀💀
Amazing video and don't let any of the harassers get you down!
Really sad that he accepted a sponsorship for hogwarts legacy, as a trans person and long time subscriber I feel very hurt, and im said that i have to unsubscribe
This looks better than all the full Englishes I’ve ever had
I've never been so devastated by a sponsorship before
Super disappointed in you. But I guess wearing a new Rolex every week requires you to support bigotry.
Yeah, not watching past the 3 second mark after finding out its sponsored by the TERF Wizard game. Im dissapointed, Babish. I thought you knew better.
As a sommelier I can recommend the perfect cheese to go with the whine you freaks are bringing. Just enjoy the video or shut up.
Just came here to say I love your content Babish and don’t let a very miserable bullies online deter you from creating great content like this
Sweet! Based that you're sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy!
Checking the "newest comments" by itself doubles as a full course american dinner on a british breakfast recipe
So funny. Instagram comments are totally different. They are going nuts! I love it.
Babish? The comment section is burning ;-;  It's not so much the sponsorship that's the problem, but the mass of transphobes it's attracted that are going ballistic on everyone with basic empathy...
Please make rig juice from regular show
I’m extremely disappointed that one of my favorite creators has essentially put a stamp of approval on people telling my friends to die. I’ve been a subscriber and supporter of this channel for years, like many. I’m done. I’m moving my subscription to Alvin’s personal channel.
disappointed in you.
Your best video yet
The fact that you've allowed harmful slurs to happen in your comment section about the LGBTQ+ community after taking a sponsorship that profits JKR? Babish, I thought you were a better person.
It seems so strange to me that Americans can’t get these products, I live 45 minutes outside of the US in Eastern Canada and I can get all these ingredients in one stop most of the time
Absolutely loving the sponsor deal.
My main thought was, “how large would a plate have to be to fit all of these items??!?” But it did look great in the end.
Never apologize Babish!! Never!! Don’t you dare take down this video, don’t you dare apologize! Fight back against these freaks.
This video has a big dislike ratio for babish standarts ... i guess the hogwarts legacy placements have something to do with that. Didnt expect that a cooking video gets influenced by that as well that has like 95% nothing to do with the game. kinda interesting.
Really really disappointed to see the Hogwarts legacy sponsorship
I’m so disappointed disgusting by this sponsorship.
based sponsor
Gonna give the Babish crew the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are blissfully unaware of the toxic discourse around a certain video game that shall remain nameless.
This was one sponsorship you should have said no to.
Rowling did nothing wrong
how much cash would it take to get you to vocally support murdering jews and trans people? instead of just implicitly?
I am gonna say it I think people are fools for bringing that controversy here. If you got beef with Rowling go take it up with Rowling, and leave honest folk alone that being those who work on, play, or even associate with the game who want nothing a part of it, as guilt by association is toxic af. IMO to those who do this they do not represent LGBTQ or any of that they are just petty complainers using guilt by association, and making said community they say they represent look bad in the process.
Im here bc some pleb is seething and can't cope over the Hogwarts Legacy  sponsorship 😂😂
i would say this is quite authentic, but ive never had bubble and squeak with a full english. much more likely that youd get hash browns in the uk
troons should LTG
So many crying men dressed as women on twitter over this lol
Troons are mad once again.
Great effort tbf however bubble and squeak is traditionally a "leftovers" from a Sunday Roast. Hash Browns are very common in a Full English and I tend to only see Black Pudding in Ulster Frys and Full Scottish breakfasts (two dishes I'd really love to see being made here)
Really disappointed in that sponsorship you took
Been a Babish subscriber for years and now I am not due to this sponsorship. As a trans person I feel betrayed by the choice to work with someone actively trying to harm our community.
I've heard of bubble & squeak but didn't know it was just fried colcannon 😁
What an awful comment section Jesus Christ
Why did I watch this in an empty stomach lol 😆 suffering now 😅
Haha the Twitter freaks found this and are melting down.
Here to say Hogwarts Legacy is an amazing game. You guys should play it!
You know you can say no to sponsorships right? Smdh
Based sponsor 10/10
Just sub and hope he gains more subscribers to make the twittertards seethe
Based
hmmm, are british folk just very particular about what constitutes a full english breakfast, or did this vid get attacked by a bunch of butthurt sjw snowflakes for advertising hogwars legacy? lol
If you have a problem with this sponsor, I envy your easy life. Love this vid Babish, ignore the vocal minority
Oh Babbish, that's not fried bread! Our fried bread is shallow or deep fried in oil
I have unsubscribed because of this sponsorship.
Coincidentally, I'm watching this while I wait for Hogwarts Legacy to finish downloading! I've always favored a classic southern American breakfast, but this full English looks so tasty.
DON'T TAKE THE MONEY BABISH   NEO MARXISTS ARE LITERALLY CRYING  DO YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE THE GHOST OF KINSEY AND JOHN MONEY CRY?   DO YOU??
Man I love full breakfasts like this
Looks great, might try this out sometime
Really disappointed in the hogwarts sponsorship. Maybe donate that sponsorship to a trans charity and drop any future deals with them.
Real disappointed in you for taking this sponsorship dude. Time to unsubscribe after years of loving your videos. Promoting this game makes your channel 100% no longer safe for trans and jewish people.
Bubble and squeak is a leftover dish, you’d use up the leftovers of a Sunday roast. Why have you flipped the eggs, flipping eggs is like the most American thing.
The troons and all the other alphabet goons are out in full force I see.
oh wow taking blood money now, really? dissappointed. do better.
Here in Australia if you order a full English breakfast at a local cafe they often use hash browns instead of bubble and squeak anyway
Interesting Sponsor.... Bit of a disappointment
Hash browns have replaced bubble and squeak in most cafes and pubs because they’re easier to buy in frozen, but it is a 100% superior  This video also proves what we already know - American bacon and sausages are rubbish
I LOVE HOGWARTS LEGACY
Some people in the comment section aren't understanding the simple fact that him taking a sponsorship has nothing to do with trans right . He took it because it helps the channel grow . At the end of the day let the people decide whether or not they want to support HP .
BABISH, DON’T GET SPONSORED BY HARRY POTTER  THERE ARE MEN IN DRESSES HANGING THEMSELVES  BABISH NOOOO
Wow, dude. Incredibly obtuse of you. I genuinely expected better. Unfollowed.
Bubble and squeak is more of a standalone thing but great video otherwise. Love your sponsor too, great game
I hope you're happy with supporting a game that helps fund a person who's well known for pushing transphobia and antisemitism.    Because I sure am!
Tomatoes should be grilled. Eggs should be sunny-side-up (which is what a fried egg is to a Brit). Bubble and Squeak isn't generally served as part of a full english, but on the occasions it is it would be real bubble and squeak, which is not what's been made here. For starters it should be chunky, and second it should have a variety of leftovers in it such as other root veg and IMO sprouts. Toast is always present, fried bread is optional.
Now do an Ulster Fry. Superior to full English in every way.
Was it worth it? I hope the greasy wizard bucks are worth the people you are alienating.
Its called the "Big Breakfast" at restaurants that serve it in Hawaii  The Immigrant and British influence in Hawaii causes a kinda international fusion with our most commonly eaten foods  Hungry Lion,Oahu, House's bowl has Scottish Bangers,Italian Sausage,Portuguese Sausage,Bacon,and Ham sharing the same bowl with Rice,Hash and eggs for instance
Based sponsorship with babish
Great video, though I'm not mad about limey cuisine I'll definitely be casting avada kedavra on every fool talking smack. And not in a game, IN REAL LIFE
WHERE SRE THE HASHBROWNS???
Bankrupt with Babish.
This looks delicious but the standard portion of a full English has always looked too big for me... to me it looks like something I'd share with a few people
I'm not sure if this would be out of character for the channel but you should try the Bonnie Burger recipe from the Fnaf cookbook. Just saying it not only as a cool suggestion but it would bring more people to the channel
New Channel name  Bangers with Bacon... Awesome video as always Babish  💙
Always wanted to try this once
I haven't had an English breakfast in a long while, this do be really making me want to make one.
Is anyone actually surprised Babish took the sponsorship? Anyone who's actively watched his content knows he enjoys HP so this isn't exactly a shock
based
i really should play hogwarts legacy soon
I'm disappointed.
Do trans people really think anyone cares about their "boycott"
I love that there are people on twitter losing their minds over this video
As an English person, your first breakfast is not traditional. We don't serve bubble & squeak at breakfast, its hash browns or no potatoes at all. Also don't flip they eggs! Thats not a thing here in the UK. You want a gooey top. They should be fried, poached or scrambled. Bangers are a slang name for any sausage, not just ones eaten at breakfast. Still looks a tasty plate though
Great content. Subbed 👍👍👍
I thought it was clickbait when I first saw it. I'm very disappointed to have been proven wrong. Your support of Hogwarts Legacy shows me that you're just like everyone else. You have no excuse to not know how harmful this sponsorship is. I will no longer be supporting any of your channels, and I will urge everyone I know to do the same.
I heard there's a certain percentage of people that like cutting the blood sausage out of their meal
tf2 sandvich when
Imagine being upset over a sponsorship less than a minute long
You should have turned down this sponsorship. I'm disappointed in you & everyone else who tries to justify giving JK more money to donate to more TERFs.
Pretty disappointing ngl
You had my curiosity, because of the people crying over Hogwarts Legacy. Now you have my attention, because I love that salty food.
You will never be a woman no matter how hard you try no matter how many grotesque surgery you did, you will never be a woman.
You did nothing wrong Babish, let those twitter freaks seethe.
I'm sad I have to unsubscribe now
Hey, I love your work so much. I feel upset that you've accepted a sponsorship from the Rowling universe. Those works are deeply transphobic and antisemitic. It's a bit of a big deal for us.
As an SE Asian, English breakfast has always been a weird thing to me. But overall I quite enjoy it from time to time.
Pretty disappointed by your choice in sponsors.
Not you accepting a HL sponsorship. You’re not an ally.
i would like to see you recreate the super cheesy pizza that was shown in goofy movie please
Okay, I know it's trite to say, and you should never idolize people, but.... this one really hurts :(
Honestly one of the best games I've ever played and the breakfast looks delicious 😋
Troons just keep taking Ls this month 🤣
very cool that youre removing all the comments about the sponsor, looks great on your part 👍 cant wait to see this one disappear too
Hogwarts already game of the year and it's only february
I don't watch Babish but it's funny to see how when someone cultivates an audience of terminally-online weirdos, it always blows up in their face
just ignore the tr4nnies, babish, they were never real fans, they were using you for a political cause
Make mr and mrs tennorman chilli
These comments are hilarious
Are the mods seriously deleting every comment that addresses the transphobia and antisemitism in this game? I'm incredibly disappointed with this channel.
Lost our family as subscribers today. You can pick and choose your sponsors, and you picked Hogwarts Legacy? Why? Pick something food-related. We've loved your videos for many years, but you're helping put money in the pockets of people who don't want other individuals to EXIST.  And I have YouTube Premium, so I "should" be able to skip the ad, except I can't, and it's frankly hurtful just thinking that it's part of the channel. You're benefiting from hatred, and apparently deleting comments about how upsetting it is from other fans (not random "NPCs" as one other commenter said), too. It... just doesn't mesh with the image you were putting out there, IMO, and it's disappointing. I wish things were different.
I'm a simple man. I see Hogwarts Legacy, I like, comment, share and subscribe.
Recommendation for another episode of Binging, American Dad episode 4-18 Francine makes Roger’s favorite meal. We don’t ever see what it is but she mentions all the ingredients
If you unsubscribe because of a simple sponsor you were never a fan in the first place. It's better off without you guys anyway we don't need your toxicity on this channel.
There was no need to accept such a wack sponsor. I’ve watched your stuff for a really long time but I’m unsubscribing today.
☹️
Not cool with the sponsor at all man. Unsubbed.
Ah yes, bangers and mash with a little transphobia on the side…
At first i thought the large number of dislikes on this video was due to the crazy woke SJW keyboard activists mass-disliking it as this video was sponsored by WB and Hogwarts Legacy (great and fun game btw 8.5/10 highly recommend), but it turns out its due to Brits having different (and im assuming the correct) opinions about an English Breakfast. XD
You guys are still at this? Nobody cares if you're dissapointed or mad at Babish it's clear you're too immature to let people enjoy a video game so why should your opinion even matter?
The food looked yummy but Babish....you have a massive following....you couldve gotten literally any other sponsor :(   Disappointed in you for real :c
With increasing legal and violent attacks against trans people, as well as a rise in antisemitism, it's really disappointing to see big figures like Babbish helping to promote a game associated with both transphobia and antisemitism. I'm sad that I'm probably not going to be as excited for Babbish videos in the future.
I'm so disappointed you took that money. I liked you. I was rooting for you. 😓
nice
y'know you might think "neutrality" is harmless, but all im saying is... there are a lot of comments singing the tune of "oh cool, you support hogwarts, you must hate trans people like i do!"
I'm a simple man. I see Hogwarts Legacy, I unsubscribe.
Trans lives matter more than fandoms.
As a long time viewer I'm extremely disappointed to see you taking that sponsorship, unsubscribed
Sad you did a sponsor for hogwarts game but still love you anyway, we all make mistakes
Really is an American version, much longer and harder to make but with worse ingredients so it sucks
:(
Poor form, Babish. Unsubbed.
Aw man, I really thought you were okay with us tŕ@nz folks. Welp, and another one bites the dust.
Please don’t delete comments.
This is so not authentic, it wasn't done at 3am after a massive bender coming home from a night out, barely standing. one pan is all you need (this comes with an illness in the morning however). Looks amazing though babish mate x
Whens the Full American Breakfast coming?  With a calorie count maybe?
Aw, why would you support that game and that author after everything she's done to trans people. As if the world isn't painful enough.
How disappointing :(
W video
Unsubbed, dump that sponsor
Cringe and forced to unsubscribe, grow a spine, unbelievably disappointing
I'll pass on Hogwarts legacy and its association, but absolutely would enjoy a breakfast inspired by the British.
Babish this is 100% a botched and you need to get a proper British chef to show you how it’s done mate
Gross sponsor.
Extremely disappointed that you’d support this anti-Semitic and transphobic work. I expected better of this channel.
bigotry with babish
unsubscribed i can't believe you are actually making a video about british people
Professor Fig dies in all endings and Rookwood cursed Anne :3
The bubble and squeak- absolutely not true. Hashbrowns or potato cakes (more a full Irish I guess) or just toast is more realistic. Also nobody really has fried bread in modern times
Crazy how besides the sausages, the american version is arguably more authentic
Disappointed
booo
very disappointed :( i’ve been following you for years, please reconsider!
Thanks for looking out for the American muggles who don't have easy access to bangers & blood sausage!
The fact that HL Antis are after this guy simply because Warner sponsored him just makes me lose all faith in the world
Binging with Babish more like Binging with CHUDISH Yikes! what a CHUD right guys????
so disappointed in babish
ew
Sorry but that bubble wasn't the best
I didnt realize how disgusting your community was :/ this is sad. do better
Really sad to see such a great channel taking money from JKR and the wizard game.
What in the ham is “Canadian back bacon” ? Sincerely - A. Canadian
U should do that rabbit dinner bill makes from the last of us series
Liked the video solely for the sponsor, don't let people bully you for childish things babish
unsubscribing for that sponsorship. bye.
I’m saving you now, don’t read the comments, they’re full of spoilers for the game!
So you're deleting comments now, huh? Can't take criticism?
Unsubscribing because this game was made by bigots for bigots. Very disappointed in you.
Never thought to butter fried bread, more often it's literally just...fried bread. I think you may be a genius?
FYI, if you're ever wondering why there's a higher dislike count than normal on this video- it's because of the sponsor. JK Rowling's anti-transgender mania has tainted Hogwarts Legacy/Harry Potter for a great many people, and are probably associating you with that, because you took a Hogwarts Legacy sponsor.
Happy 10m subs
It's shameful to accept a sponsorship for a product known for being transphobic, anti-semetic, and profits bigots. You can delete all the YouTube comments you want, but conversations are happening outside of this platform, and you have disappointed so many people.
This is less a Full English and more a hate crime.
It's really sad that all the harassment, doxxing, and death threats going on with Hogwarts Legacy is a lot of people's first exposure to trans people. Such a great first impression to make.
Cringe and unsubscribed
i like how there are tons of dislikes but most of the top comments about "bubble and squeak" so Babish/Co probably think they actually just upset the British lol
I'd been watching you for years but never expected this from you. While you're unlikely to see this I hope this was a sponsorship you took out of necessity and not genuinely enjoying the anti-jewish plotline of a game based on the works of a transphobic woman.
Unsubscribed for Hogwash Blood Libel sponsorship. Apologize. Feel remorse. Do better.
Disappointed
Andrew going full method. We all know there's no way to make an authentic British meal without a healthy dose of anti trans bigotry.
Reported
Bubble and squeak is only really ever on a full English post Sunday lunch so Monday morning I guess, not something we eat very often
Trans fan of several years very sad to see you're taking WB's money on this one. I'm unsubbing.
First the NFT comment on twitter and now this sponsorship? Very disappointed. Its sad cause I also went out to your book signing a while back. Sorry man, unsubscribing.
Hogwarts legacy is a game heavily associated with jk Rowling, who uses her public platform to be hateful towards transgender people
I'm disappointed to see this sponsorship on your channel.
Hmmm. Maybe not the best sponsor
I love your channel but this was a very poor interpretation of the “Full English”. Your bubble and squeak was very wrong and we won’t have it with breakfast, your black pudding was brown and not black?? Clue in the name it wasn’t proper English Black Pudding. We don’t have over east eggs that’s American. We would have sliced tomatoes fried like your Canadian version. Worth looking at Sorted Food Channel and seeing their best breakfast in London. thanks Steve
Much rather have some bubble with my breakfast than hashbrowns like some of the comments are saying. Only criticism is the bacon has to be crispy!
Oh snap canceled canceled canceled. I'm kidding if no one can tell.
Didn't expect you to be taking this sponsorship. Sorry, but unsubscribed.
Very disappointed in your choice of sponsorship Babish. I expected better from you
Yeah, really disappointed by your sponsorship folks, as, clearly, are many others here.   I'm a longtime subscriber and thought a lot better of everyone there. As big as the channel is and with all the other merchandise and everything you have out, you definitely didn't need the sponsor either.   I won't be leaving yet because I think you deserve the benefit of the doubt, but do better!
Only thing authentic is the transphobia. I'm out.
So I know comments critical of the sponsorship are being deleted, but I have to say, as someone who's subscribed to this channel for years, I'm deeply disappointed in not only the sponsorship choice but the reaction to feedback about it. It's okay if the team didn't know the game was horribly antisemitic,  or about the jkr radfem issues. It's not okay to recieve that feedback and then ignore and silence it. Sad to say I have to unsubscribe.
All the glorious waterworks over one sponsorship is pathetic. Like, "ooohhh nooo, ive watched you from day one but this ONE sponsor is unforgivable!" Talk about weak. Like Babish isnt known for this, but this is all it takes to unsub?
I enjoy my breakfast without transphobia, thank you :>
Unsubscribed. I am very disappointed in this partnership you have chosen.
Fun video!
Extremely disappointed with the sponsorship choice.  Unsubscribing.
Transphobe behavior. Unsubbing from the money gruber
Incredibly disappointed by this TERF nonsense being a sponsor of this channel. I thought you were an ally Andrew???
Do the dinner from last of us
Yum Terf breakfast
"This episode of Binging with Babish was brought to you by Raytheon Technologies."
disappointed that you took a sponsor from an IP filled with bigotry, owned by an author who's been using her platform solely to try and demonize trans people over the past few years. do better
Extremely disappointed you would support this kind of hate. Will not be watching this channel again.
Seriously?!? This is disappointing.
this sponsor seriously breaks my heart, babish i was rooting for you :(
Love Hogwarts Legacy, love JK Rowling, love Babish.
I am incredibly disappointed you would take the Hogwarts game as a sponsor. I expected higher standards, but the machine of capitalism churns on regardless of morals and ethics. It's nice to know you have neither
andrew the transphobia wizard game ad is really disappointing :(
Came here to read the comments. Turns out my breakfast is extra salty today.
I like food
Bubble and Squeak is more a Boxing Day food than part of a Full English. It’s made from the Christmas dinner left over potatoes and veg. It’s not mashed smoothly it more chunky with the mashing. It is also usually fried in a frying pan like where it is made in to a disc which becomes crispy and then is broken up. This step is repeated a few times so it comes out like a solid, crispy disc of potato and veg.
Deeply disappointing. I used to think you had integrity.
im disappointed in you. i expected better
Man, I know you gotta get that money, but I've been a viewer for a while and I'm really disappointed you're promoting the Harry Potter game...
Full Scottish Breakfast for the win! We have tattie scones! 😋
Lol nope
Hey Babish what are your thoughts of the trans character being called SIRona RYAN and the slaves?
Hogwarts legacy is a fine game, dont you let any twitter crazies give you flack for taking a sponsorship!
Andrew, I do implore you to do much more scrutinized looks at your sponsors in the future. Rowling's stances on the LGBTQ+ community is a long-known thing, especially the fact that she interprets every penny of royalties to validate her agenda. I'm sure Harry Potter meant a lot to you too, but the point of the matter is that it is literally impossible to separate the art from the artist. There's way too much pain inflicted here. Also, you've got no more than three trolls trying to drum up more anger in these comments. Not saying you should take these comments down, but you should definitely take time to read them.
Embarrassing sponsorship. Glad I unsubbed years ago.
I wanna try that back bacon...
Came here from the Instagram page. If you want people's actual reactions to the sponsorship, go over there before they get cleaned out. This is deeply disappointing. I've been a fan for years, but anyone who continues to put money in JKR's pocket is a nope for me. The cake a few months ago already had me raising my eyebrows, but this is the nail in the coffin.
even if the game has a trans character in it, doesn't matter. it's tokenism to make you forget how bigoted jkr is. the money is going to someone who has a dangerous amount of power in the uk that directly affects trans people. not to mention the antisemitic rhetoric she spewed that inspired the goblins in this game. this is very disappointing.
Dude they're literally killing trans teenagers because of the rhetoric that J.K. Rowling has helped popularize. This is a ghoulish money grab.
Sad to see you taking their money.
I'm going to miss you, and Alvin... Kendall, and everyone...  but if you are peddling Hogwarts (or anything JKR), I'm out.  Thank you... but... 🏳‍⚧
botched on so many fronts this episode dude :/ and i ain't just talking about the meal
I'm surprised this video is still up. Couldn't watch more than the first 20 seconds when it aired. I had to stay a bit longer after the first few seconds to make sure it wasn't a joke. Not sure how long I'll stay subscribed after this.
I’ve been a subscriber for years. I’ve made plenty of your recipes for friends. I also used to be a Harry Potter lover- before I understood how transphobic and anti-Semitic JKR is.   JKR has stated that anyone that associates with Warner Brothers Inc., is supporting her directly. You might not think a sponsorship like this is supporting anti-trans/anti-semitism, but SHE sure does.
blatant misinformation, British people aren't real
Why did you have to accept this sponsor of all possible sponsors? Sincerely, a disappointed fan
Food idea: [Pipis] FROM THE [Cool] GAME [Deltarune]
I'm disappointed that you would use Soylent green in your meal. It's made of people! I'm out unsubscribing.
So disappointing…..
Sponsored by Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States Of America.
I’m so disappointed. So so disappointed. This wasn’t even very on brand for you, you could’ve even kept quiet/away from this. I’m bemused and disappointed.
Sponsored by the Zodiac Killer/Ted Cruz.
Unfortunate. Best of luck on future endeavors, your commentary and cooking will be missed.
mmmm transphobic game sponsonship
Glad to know that a sponsorship  from a terrible video game is worth more to you than the safety of and solidarity with your Trans and Jewish fans. I’m so disappointed. Unsubscribing.
Babish u don't need money from a franchise that uses its money and influence to hurt people.
Long time follower of the channel. Sorry to see you take support from JK Rowling and Co. Will see myself out now.
Babish why
As a trans person I am so sad about this sponsor. You make plenty of money - why take this one? I wish you luck in the future but I am no longer going to follow along
Really disappointed to see the hogwarts legacy sponsorship. Unsubscribing.
Well I guess this shows your stance on trans and jewish people who are effected by the game. The fact comments are being deleted about it too shows you dont care what your community thinks or has to say. Loved your videos so this is just disappointing ..
New Theory: The Babish team was so happy celebrating finally getting 10M subscribers last month, they want to do it next year too!
Could you do a series of Rohl Dahl foods or maybe Wes Andwerson
After the NFT thing, this is honestly disappointing, but unsurprising
oh the hogwarts legacy sponsorship wasn’t it…
man i really don’t see why someone as large and successful as you would need to accept a hogwarts legacy sponsorship, like how is that more worth it to you than allyship to trans people
Really disappointed about the hogwarts sponsorship man! I was hoping you’d have principles
Andrew, you’re rich enough that you can pass on sponsorships like this.  Put standing against bigotry over your own comfort.
Rookwood cursed anne
"today's episode of Binging With Banish is sponsored by the NRA"
I was turned off as soon as he started with bubble and squeak. Definitely not a part of a fry up. You can do better Babish.
Neither bubble and squeak or hash browns are part of a traditional full english. It is known as black pudding and not blood sausage here. Never seen cherry tomatoes on my plate. Always large toms halved and grilled. Back bacon is much nicer than streaky.
Based Legacy Sponsored Babish.
Congrats on being a sellout, but considering the shilling for NFTs this was to be expected, unsubscribed.
Sorry Andrew, the ad ruined this for me.
This video is sponsored by Lord of all the fish of the sea, Master of all the beasts of the jungle, Idi Amin.
You may as well have gotten sponsored by David Irvine.
disappointed that you’re willing to accept blood money from the terf queen to pay the bills. i guess wizard game is more important than trans lives? disappointed. unsubscribed. you burned your trust with me. adam ragusea would never.
When are you going to be sponsored by Cthulu?
wow these comments are suspiciously squeaky clean!! i wonder why!
Disappointed
Cringe Ts are malding 🤣
also since its base in Scotland where are the tattie scones? Emm would it not be a Scottish full breakfast since Hogwarts is in Scotland?
Where are the hash browns? even McD's has hash browns for breakfast menu lol
Bubble and squeak is not made correctly but fair try.
Aw no not the hogwarts legacy sponsor…
Episode Request: In the Toy Story short Small Fry, there are pictures of various food items that show during the credits that are themed as a fast food menu.
Man, how you have fallen over the last few years is just sad to see.
Can you make a devil fruit, or a dragon ball cake
disappointed to see the sponsorship for the TERF wizard game....
yall really out here deleting all the negative comments huh :/ really thought better of you </3
im so dissapointed youd advertise this horrible game and support its horrible creators
to all my trans friends out there don't worry i see you, your not a woman, and it is valid to join the 42%
Hey this sucks brother, very disappointed
Babish, I’m really disappointed that no one in your entire team of the BCU raised any objections with this sponsor. This was a real gut punch and im genuinely sad that I truly will no longer even enjoy your work with the knowledge that trans people mean less than a check to you. you just got to an audience of ten million subscribers and then immediately turn around and advertise supporting transphobia to them. ouch Andrew. OUCH
cringe sponsorship andrew
babish, you are a disappointment
The whole comment section is tripping bruh, you mfs need to get out more
Unsubscribed over the hogwarts legacy ad. Don’t take or give money to people who’ve staked their brand and legacy on open, viscous bigotry and bullying. And especially not an obscenely wealthy person who takes advantage of the UK’s restrictive libel laws and threatens to sue average citizens who criticize her on twitter into silence.
Bubble and Squeak is a Monday evening dish with Sunday Lunch leftovers.
re Hogwarts Legacy, Professor Fig dies in all the endings and Rookwood is the one who cursed Anne.
I’m disappointed, babby.  I hope they gave you a ton of money
Wow this comment section is filled with clowns today. Jk rowling is a bad person. Andrew is not. If you can’t make that distinction then you go enjoy the rest of your life. Just don’t bring that negativity where its not needed☺️
Fine recipe but SPOILERS for Hogwarts legacy!
Too much cancer causing smoking seed oil Imo
love the channel but…hogwarts legacy sponsorship? bye.
What's taters, precious?
Duuuuuuuuuude! Hogwarts legacy? Unsubscribed dude, disappointed
Very disappointing sponsorship choice. Miss me with any pride videos this year.
As a fan, pretty disappointed Babish.. the trans community never ask for much and ally ship really doesn’t take too much to keep up with..
Very disappointed to see Babish take sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy
love the very obvious deleting of comments criticising the Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship. very cool
I was a really big fan of Babish before this video, devastated to see him accept this sponsorship. Just another reminder that people are only allys until it affects their life in any way. Hope the money was worth it, it wasn't like he didn't already have enough of it.
I am very disappointed to see you accept a sponsor from Hogwart's Legacy. If you are okay with promoting the IP of such a vile transphobe as JK Rowling, I have no choice but to unsubscribe from this channel.
in 🇬🇧 flipping fried eggs is never done 🍳
wow. extremely disappointing.
Why delete comments talking about the sponsorship? Why get paid for something you can’t own up to?
Dude this sucks. SUCKS
11k dislikes. yikes. thats a lot of angry people. wonder how many subs lost because you took the terf game sponsorship babs ;)
Aw man, this particular sponsor is...disappointing, to say the least
extremely disappointed in you for taking this sponsor Andrew :(
Andrew I've been a subscriber since your first Parks and Rec video in 2016, sad to say I'll be unsubscribing after this! It's easy to say you don't support JKR and her views, but when she is so inexorably tied to the franchise and using its continued popularity as evidence for how many supporters she still has, all the while funnelling her money into causes designed to directly harm trans people in the UK and across the world, I just don't think that stands up. I hope you donate profits from this video to a cause like the Trans Asylum Seekers Support Network or something similar, and have a think about what values you want this channel to represent.
Have been a watcher from the beginning. Unsubbed. You didn’t need to take that sponsorship.
oh jesus the ratio
been following you for ages. this sucks, man
Poor choice in sponsor
Really man? Come on. This is disappointing.
Baking with bigot with that sponsor
honestly extremely disappointed in the choice of accepting this sponsor. i have been watching this series since the very beginning, but i dont feel i can support it any more.
Are some of the comments being deleted? That's interesting. Want to say anything about that BCU?
*very* disappointed with this Andrew  but , it tracks with your recent business ventures
was gonna watch the video til i saw it was sponsored by hogwarts legacy. surely you couldve found another sponsor besides an antisemitic game that pays royalties to a notorious and influential transphobe. I am unsubscribing specifically because of this.
Babish! Not the TERF anti-Semitic game!
Very cool to watch babish take sponsorship money out of Rowling's blood-soaked hands.
I can't believe you're being sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy. That is.. certainly a choice. :-/
😢 I’ve been a patron for years, a subscriber for longer. But as someone with a transgender partner I cannot continue to support you 😓
I'm disappointed to see you take a sponsorship from the antisemite wizard game. Unsubbing.
I need to get a ricer
Still deleting comments?
Make the Nasty Patty
Disappointing to see you taking money from Rowling.
Very disappointed you would take this sponsor. Cannot  engage with your content unless this is rectified. Creator of the game world is a bigoted transphobe and the game’s dev team was lead by a bigoted gamer-gate guy.
Disappointed
Looking forward to the Kanye sponsorship, loser
Transformers are seething right now.
There are trophies you can earn in the game that are Goblin Heads, and they are literally modeled after real world historic Antisemetic propaganda. Several pieces of promotional imagery of the Goblins is also heavily based on real world antisemetic imagery. Please seriously consider how much of your audience you are alienating when you are accepting sponsorships from transphobic and antisemetic properties.
How much does the ad pay?
i’ve loved your channel for years and as a trans fan i am incredibly disappointed right now. i expected better from you.
selling out with babish
Babish and people like JK Rowling are the reason why we need the return of brutal, oppressive authoritarian COMMUNISM!
Looks like your sponsor paid you an awful lot of money because otherwise huh? Also you should have made a cup of tea to go with!
imagine making as much money as babish and still happily accepting a transphobic sponsor
top comments about negative sponsor feedback got deleted. I've seen lots of lots of posts about this video on tumblr and Reddit already. way to go, sellout!
not cool, dude.
Disappointed by the acceptance of the sponsor
he probably knew bubble and squeak isn't traditional, he just wanted an excuse to make a full english again for botched
friendly suggestion to just play elden ring or something instead. even without the knowledge that my money would be going to an evil little woman like JKR this game looks so unbelievably mid. hardly surprising though, considering the source material and JKRs almost impressive lack of talent 😒
The Canadian bacon looked like just ham, or back bacon. Usually what people call “Canadian bacon” is peameal bacon which has peameal on the outside. It’s the best
It sucks that you'd accept money from transphobes, dude.
Cringing with Babish
Babish transphobia embarassment
Those sausages remind me of all the endings where Professor Fig dies, which is all of them.
Thank you for finally making me remember to unsubscribe you bald little terf supporter
Really disappointed by the harry potter sponsorship, won't be watching this channel anymore. I like the content but I can't support antisemitism and transphobia in such a blatant fashion
Gross, imagine promoting a game that is not only antisematic but also funds the genocide of transpeople
Very disappointed to hear you supporting antisemitic, transphobic content. Unsubscribing.
Oh boy this is gonna upset twitter
Love the sponsor of this episode ❤
Ew, you support JKR and the awful antisemitic game HWL??  Sorry babish, but im not gonna follow anyone who supports transphobes and a game with blood libel as the main plot.  Bye
Disappointed Babish Team. I can't imagine you're starving for sponsors and to take money to promote this game is sad to see. You lost a subscriber today.
Mfs in this comments section are really acting like they’re being genocided by a video game, lol
hogwarts legacy is antisemetic and extremely problematic, so dissapointed
This choice of sponsorship is deeply disappointing, as someone who's enjoyed your content for many years.
I physically flinched when Babish told the words Hogwarts Legacy. I was soo scared that the idiots behind the boycott would just start spewing hate. Thank the gods that everyone of his viewers are sane.
I have to say that I am very disappointed to see the ad for this game here. As a fan of yours and a trans person, I've always felt safe in your spaces until now. I've watched for a long time, purchased your book, and I'm incredibly sad to walk away. Do better.
Bubble and squeak always dinner not breakfast
I'm extremely disappointed in this sponsorship with a game not only associated with a major contributor to anti trans rhetoric but the content of the game itself is extremely antisemitic as well. I'm unsubscribing. Accepting money to promote content like that is absolutely unacceptable.
i'm sure glad comments that are critical of an extremely racist transphobe who created a game about blood libel aren't being hidden! how are the NFTs going?
It is really disappointing to see that you would support the legacy of a franchise that a transphobic woman actively financially benefits from. JKR continues to make the political landscape of the UK unsafe for trans folks and there is no point in pretending as if Harry Potter is not tied to her wealth and power.
So disappointing that you and your team have decided to accept this sponsorship deal. Why does money have to come before morals? Do better.
you ruined it
🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Nothing's more english than breakfast! Except for transphobic games!
While everyone is entitled to their opinions, don't shame Babish and friends for their choice in sponsorship.  They don't share your lack of a moral compass.
Ah yes, the most important ingredient in an english breakfast: transphobia.
Very disappointing to see you collaborating with Hogwarts Legacy, Andrew and team. I know you've got bills to pay, but taking money from the Blood Libel game brought to you by the World's Biggest Transphobe is a serious lapse in judgement from you guys. I hope you can rebuild trust with your LGBTQIA+ and Jewish audience, and learn to be more discerning about who you're partnering with.
wow i'm so glad that there is no censorship of commentors here and that angry fans are allowed to speak their opinion :-) sure happy to subscribe to content creators who so greatly respond to backlash :-) nothing more to see here folks
Very disappointed in you Babish for taking a sponsorship for Hogwarts Legacy. No reason you needed to take a check from them. JK Rowling gets a cut from sales of this game and uses that money to harm trans people. Please do better.
out of all the sponsorships you could have taken, it had to be that one?
Babish no! This one really hurts, unsubscribing :(
flimsy & disappointing morals. do better
Cringing with Babish
I don't normally tell people when I unsub, but you deserve to know it was for your choice in sponsorship. Trans people are not a coalition or a conspiracy; they're my neighbors and friends, and they deserve to live well. Find better bosses to shill for, bro.
Feel better butter biscuits from big city greens
Today I learned that accepting money to promote a wizard game that has already topped sales charts and broken records is the equivalent to pulling the trigger on trans people lol. Get over yourselves. It's a video game. Go protest JK's actual profitable money making avenues like her brand deals with Universal, or go out and do something that will actually gain traction and make real change. Seething over a video game boycott that has already failed will solve nothing.
Painfully disappointed with this channel taking this sponsorship, I'll be unsubscribing for this.
really disappointed to see the sponsor for this, the issues with jkr and the whole harry potter franchise are so well known that this can't just be ignorance, will be unsubscribing until this is addressed or at least until you drop the sponsorship.
Thought this was a basics episode, immediately stopped watching when I saw Hogwarts Legacy come up. What a gross thing to support.
Please make tf2 sandvich!!
You should do the sauce from new girl season 4 episode 17
bigotry with babish
Ew. JK ROWLING is a TERF. Why would you take money from them?
Pretty disappointed to see you take a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy, a Video Game with Antisemitic themes in a world created by a virulent transphobic woman who is currently spearheading a massive hate campaign against trans folk. I thought better of you Babish.
Hey man. I loved your channel. Learned a lot. But accepting a sponsorship from the blood libel game where all the royalties go towards actively oppressing and harming trans people isn’t something im okay with. As a trans person this hugely impacts me, and it really shows me where your priorities lie when it comes to your community. So I’m leaving, and whether that means something or not to you, whatever. But i know I’m not the only one.
You know banish lost any of my respect as a trans person. And I stand against antisemitism for obvious reasons. I just find it interesting that Professor Fig dies in all possible endings and Rookwood is the one who cursed Anne. That's all :3
its funny that its the twitter mob crying in the comments because elon musk runs twitter and he makes fun of pronouns so are you clowns going to boycott that too or nah? im so disappointed you guys are using a website thats supporting genocide :( every time someone posts a tweet a trans person literally gets sent to the gulag!
At this point, there is no excuse not to know. Enjoy your sponsor money, it's sad to know where your morals lie I guess.
Oh cool, paid for by the Terf Game.  Thought you were better than this.
Professor Rockwood dies at the end. 0:02
Could you make the sandvich from TF2?
babish pls make sandvich from team fortress 2 !!!!!
hope the check was worth it !
Welcome back to Bigots with Babish.
Has Andrew hired a Wizard to delete the huge volumes of comments from disgusted (ex) followers?
Super disappointed to see where his morals lie I guess
i’m so sad about the choice in sponsorship :/
Been a subscriber for years and unsubbed over this one, because I find this game immoral. Very disappointing you'd take money from this sponsor. Hope it was worth it I guess.
It only cost your soul
The biggest indicator that you shouldn’t have done this is that transphobes and antisemites are congratulating you in the comments. That’s the side you decided to stand with by taking that money. Hope you find that the fleas are worth the dogs.
Pretty disappointed you'd take an anti-Semitic transphobe's money, not gonna lie.
Sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy where you can experience the inner-life of a wannabe-genocidal billionaire maniac, I'm sold!
Never thought I was going to have to do this, but I'm unsubbing. No one who supports the TERF, Anti-Semitism, or transphobia is someone I can engage with.
Wish I could watch this, but I can’t support that game. Disappointed.
A full English is a great Brekkie.   To me a full Scottish Brekkie is superior!   I love me some haggis at Brekkie.
Is it true that they're re-launching Harry Potter with a Trans- character called Harriet Potter?
Ah geez what the heck man. This gets an unsubscribe from me. I'm disappointed.
I was going to comment "What's up with the dislikes?" but I have a feeling I know what it is.
22k likes, 8k comments, 550k views 10m subscribers... I think this channel is doing just fine.
babish why would you let terf in chief's IP sponsor you
You knew what you were doing. Unsubbed.
Ohhh no. Unfollowing and disliking this video because of the Hogwarts association. I’m so disappointed because I’ve always loved these videos, but Jewish and Trans people come first.
unsubbed, why take a sponsor from a game you know is directly tied to a bigot, who uses their influence to directly try to make the lives of trans people around the world worse?
Ignore all the grown children with a  superiority complex who think playing a video game kills trans people. You can accept any sponsor you want and there's nothing wrong with it.
Really sad to see you taking money from someone who, in no uncertain terms, wants me dead. Really thought the channel was better than that. Unsubscribed after so many years.
Really nice to see how the comment section is getting brigaded.   Did you all do this when the aunt petunia pudding episode aired a few months ago?
disappointed with you for taking this sponsor. i understand money is needed to keep doing what you do, but supporting antisemitism and transphobia this way is heart breaking.
I'm a jew, I'm trans, and I'm disappointed in you babbish team.  our communities asked the world to do one tiny thing, litterally the least you all could do, because you don't listen to us when we ask you for the big things.   And you all said no. Shame on you all.
Sad to see someone I thought was a decent enough seeming person draw a deliberate line in the sand on which viewers he prefers and that it’s the bigoted ones.
Make me hungry
Extremely disappointing.
Incredibly disappointed that you chose to accept this sponsorship. :(
Of course, it can't be a full English breakfast without transphobia!
How about a full Bavarian. But real stuff
...wow, this is disappointing. I have LOVED your videos and in fact, have binged on Binging with Babish. Until I heard about this sponsorship. Won't be watching you again, until I hear you on the right side.
Disappointed in the partnership Andrew, wish your team had done their homework. I know sponsorships are an important part of the creator budget but I doubt you all needed this one. Been watching you for years and this is a major bummer.
unsubbing for the bigotry sponsorship
Babish... I gotta say I'm really disappointed in you for taking a harry potter sponsorship.
Well, it's unfortunate because i love the stuff you make. but your accepting a sponsorship deal with blood libel the video game and queen terf ip just made unsubscribing a very easy decision for me.  Goodbye Babish.
❤ nicely done! We just enjoyed high tea for the first time, and tell you what the little finger foods are delicious. The English certainly know how to enjoy themselves. Thank you for sharing!❤
bummed about the sponsorship. money that goes to jk rowling goes to anti trans orgs that actively make life harder in the uk for trans folks. unsubbed.
Im really disappointed in the decision to take a sponsorship from the new Harry Potter game.  Even if JKR wasn't so loudly transphobic, the new game is really antisemitic.  A channel I've watched for years is supporting someone who blatantly hates who I am and all of my friends for being themselves.  She directly profits from the game and she donates to and supports anti trans organizations.  I don't even know what to say.
Wondering if someone on your brand management team had the brilliant idea to include "bubble and squeak," knowing it was deliberately incorrect to drown out the comments about accepting sponsorship from a known antisemitic and transphobic game.
Unsubbing for the game endorsement. Disappointed in you.
heartbroken that you chose to take a sponsorship with the company that made Hogwarts Legacy. As a trans fan of yours i’m very disappointed, and honestly kind of surprised
I am a transgender fan and I've been watching your channel for years. I am feeling grieved by needing to unsubscribe today because if people are emboldened by Hogwarts Legacy to "take a stand against trans ideology" then I and people like me are the ones who will suffer for it. If people feel comfortable playing a game about antisemitism, my friends are the ones who will end up suffering for it.The Babish Culinary Universe has made their stance clear that I am not welcome, so now having been shown the door I will go through it.
duuuuude you could make money literally anywhere else why did you decide to take money from the vocally opposed antisemetic game?? i hope you see your error and take time to learn about why people are being hurt by j.k rowling and the constant support of her and her IP.
Imagine having so much privilege you're upset over some guy's video sponsorship. Over fake outrage, no less. Don't you dorks have real issues to try solving? Or do you just cry over first world problems?
Have been a fan for years and loved your tv and media inspired videos. Shame I never really thought about your morals as a person until you took money from bigots to promote their propaganda. Such a shame
Thanks for letting us know where you stand on Joanne's blood libel wizarding game. Your comments are now filled with terfs and antisemites. Have fun.
Come on man. Research your sponsorships.
Sorry, but I'm out. It's highly disappointing that you've chosen to associate yourself with bigotry. Even ignoring the issues with JKR herself,  that game is antisemitic and transphobic on its own merits.
that's a lot of salt.
Huh, had no idea Babish was cool with transphobia. Say no to those sponsors.
Really disappointed to see you support a transphobic and antisemitic game
Hot take- Including a paid promotion from a TERF's newest venture is ACTIVE transphobia.
babish blood libel embarrassment
oh nice! the blood sausage goes perfectly with the blood money the blood libel game is giving you :)
Surely you had other choices than to take this sponsorship.
really disappointed to see your channel promoting antisemitism and transphobic ideology
really disappointing to see you take a sponsorship from the terfy antisemitic game :/
i'm disappointed at the sponsor man
You lost me. Why you have to back HL? Disappointed in you
I once dated a guy who made this every Saturday morning.
Such a shameless Outrage! I am Disappoint! My precious feelings are now shattered forever! Did I do it right fellow allies?
All the crossdressers big mad in this comment section 🤣🤣🤣
😬 disappointing to see a harry potter sponsorship
Spineless behavior to take money from one of the most antisemitic games made this generation.
was excited to see the title but really disappointed that you took this sponsorship
other than that 10 minute anti trans rant you went on the breakfast was pretty accurate
Liked the video itself. I love breakfast. Didn't like the sponsor, since its connected to Rowling and her TERF bs.
I haven't watched a babish video in ages, and this finally gave me a reason to unsubscribe
Hmm would be cool if you could do this video without the TERF sponsorship. Bye.
this is so disappointing but then you add deleting comments and limiting comments on instagram?? it just tells me you don’t care about your trans or jewish viewers.
Let's throw more support to Babish. Force these mad dislikers away
Babish Bigot Embarrassment
It's never called Blood Sausage just Black Pudding
Wow who knew babish was so based.
It’s really disappointing to see the BCU taking a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy. I understand that sponsorships are important for creators to sustain their livelihood. But promoting and taking money from an intellectual property that contributes to Transphobia and Anti-Semitism and actively harms the lives of those minority communities is really disheartening and hurtful to see, especially from a creative team I have dearly enjoyed watching for a long time. I expected better from everyone at BCU.
Gotta agree with a lot of the other commenters, bubble and squeak is very rare with a full english and is usually hash browns instead, Another hting to keep in mind is most of us brits will not do over easy eggs your far more likely to get sunny side up. Its quite common to have toast and fried bread though the bread is usually deep fried not pan fried buttered bread. Also bangers is traditionally the name for sausages served with mash on a full english they would just be called sausages.
unsubscribed. disappointed in you babish
Honestly kinda disappointed that you took a sponsorship from mean wizard lady. The only thing worse than British food is their opinions.
Unfortunate.  I've been subscribed for a while, but I dont think I can ethically support a creator which gets payed to sponsor hateful media.
Cringe
This sucks, I'm really upset and disappointed - Unsubscribed
Yah, no bubble and squeak on a full English, we prefer hash browns too😂 bubble and squeak is usually eaten on Boxing Day (the day after Xmas day) using up the leftover potatoes and veggies.
I went into this thinking: "well he's bound to get some of it wrong but since noone has really defined the contents of a full english breakfast, it will be fine I'm sure" .... 40 seconds in..... bubble and squeak. That's 100% an Irish breakfast thing I'm afraid.
I can't believe that this didn't address the controversy of red sauce vs brown sauce.  Also the whole moral quandary about the game.
JK Rowling is a transphobe and an antisemite. I can't believe there are still people out there promoting her products and engaging with her work. Aren't you embarrassed?!
As a Brit, I have to ask, does anyone else in Britain have bubble and squeak with their breakfast? Because down here in the south its definitely hash browns... We only have bubble and squeak to reuse leftovers from a sunday roast for dinner?
disappointed. but to be honest, your recipes have always been kinda mid so it's not a huge loss one way or another
I am so disappointed in you choosing to actively support and monetize transphobia. You should be ashamed.
Unsubscribing.
Really disappointed in you. JKR’s hatred of trans people is well known, and taking money from a game with her name on it just reinforces that. Expected better. I really enjoy your content but as a trans person I can’t continue following. Do better.
Babish, I love your channel and all the different stuff on here. I'm sure you know about the controversy surrounding the game you used to sponsor this video, and you're still okay with it despite alienating your trans viewers? I'm really disappointed that you would do this.
huge lol @ all the people pretending their life is impacted by this
That looks delicious, but that's not a full English up North.   Also, bubble and squeak is Mondays dinner made from the left overs from the Sunday roast.
heartbroken to unsubscribe over this sponsorship. please research the bigoted contributions of advertising this game specifically andrew. :( i have been a fan of your content for years
Nah man. Unsubbing.
Unsubscribing specifically because of this sponsorship. If you care so little about trans people and Jewish people as to take money from a game they have been telling us for so long not to support, you've lost any and all respect I had for you.
Love this video, and love your content!
You can keep deleting my respectful comment  As a Jewish person with Trans family members, seeing this promotional content is deeply disappointing.
We're really still out here supporting that game? Disappointing
Cringe
Disappointing. Sorry to see you go buddy.
Were you high while cooking, editing, voiceover-ing and choosing a sponsor?
hope the bigot's money was worth it dude
That ain't no bubble and squeak I've ever had. Rest of it spot on.
hugely disappointing sponsorship. hope the lack of morals was worth the money
It's like people never heard of SponsorBlock before. Also, play the funny wizard game if you want. Don't let radical Twitter mobs harass you into thinking you're a bad person for wanting to play a video game.  They're the bad people in all of this and find more value in harassing and threatening anyone who dares to stream a game that someone is excited for or takes a sponsorship so they can pay their bills or keep a roof over their head. If these people really cared about supporting their cause, they'd donate to charities and go to the voting ballots to vote in politicians who support their views. Instead, they opt to go for low-hanging fruit and ruin other peoples' lives because they don't like a billionaire who had no involvement in the game and makes money through so many other means.  Your barbaric efforts are for nothing, and the people higher up in power are laughing at you and those who you viciously attack.
I wish i could eat this much in the morning, but it looks like it would make a great dinner
To this day, I don't understand "Canadian bacon". It's back bacon, and for some reason in the states y'all just make it circular
Taking money from the transphobic blood libel game? Really disappointing dude
why the terf antisemitic game? when you could have done literally anything else instead?
Transphobic content to ally yourself with. Disappointed and unsubscribed.
never thought I’d see babish supporting a transphobe….
Not Babish being sponsored by "Anti-Semitism: the game" developed and funded by rightwing "alt-right" game developers and TERFs
oh yikes
The amount of clowns in the comments complaining about a sponsorship and only proving they haven't a clue what they are actually angry about and engaging in ironically a "witch hunt" is beyond disappointing...how about you joke of activists stop using minorities as shields so you can bully and harass everyone who is even looks at a friggin video game.
Cringing with Babish
Wow, unsubscribed.
:(
wildly irresponsible, if not downright hateful, to agree to advertise jkr’s blood libel simulator. disgusting.
Really disappointed that you took a sponsorship from the terf game.
Breakfasts from around the world would be a great series but I'm not sure if I'm comfortable watching someone who supports hatred so much as to still be willing to align with jkr. This used to be a comfort show, but how can I find comfort in the content of someone who hates me?
Disappointed. Unsubscribed.
Wizard game is cringe and you should feel bad for shilling.
Which part of the breakfast makes you a rotten old woman that oppresses trans people
As if you needed this sponsor
Can't wait for them to foam up at the mouth at the sight of the add
Real disappointed with the choice of sponsor, your team should have known better. For shame
AMAZING
man, i hope u realized its not just a sponsorship, its a statement (whether you like it or not). if you didn't intend for that, explain yoself quick. if you did... message received? rip :(
really sad to see this.
Nobody's gonna forget you took that sponsorship, man.
The game which is sponsoring this video is wildly xenophobic and transphobic. @babishculinaryuniverse please look into this
Sorry Babish, I can’t support someone who’s promoting an anti-Semitic game made by alt-right writers and developers and that gives money to transphobic people. I’ll be unsubscribing.
Man, I had expected better from you than to take sponsorship from WB Games considering whose IP the game is based on. I will be unsubscribing
couldnt u just use one normal frying pan for the meat why do need a massive one specifically u would only need that at B&B or a resturaunt
My grandfather loved black pudding. Had it every day with his breakfast. Loved it so much, he visited the factory where it was made.  Then never ate it again for the rest of his life...
Hope all the dilators in the comments realize that normal people don’t have panic attacks when a wizard game is mentioned
Have a go at an Ulster Fry…… 👍🏼
Unsubscribing
Unsubscribing ✌️
Cant believe he hates trans people like this.
cmon man
Hi Andrew and co. this will probably get lost on the fray, but I wanted to take a moment to express my disappointment w this sponsor choice. The dev team behind this game is explicitly anti-Semitic and Rowling uses a vast amount of her royalties to fund transphobic hate groups here in the UK. It might feel like a few too many degrees of separation, but accepting sponsorships like these just adds to a climate of anti-Semitism and transphobia in which lots of people already aren't safe.   I hope you can reconsider this video and the other HP content you have on here.
Bad call taking money from creators that want people like me dead. I thought you were better than this.
Unsubscribed. :/  Bad call, taking that HP money.
Missed opportunity to do the video in an English accent...
Ew, gross, Harry Potter
would love to see you not taking money from hogwart’s legacy. actually very disappointing.
Disappointed in you here, Babish. You can't be an ally while in the pocket of transphobic, anti semitic, racist trash. Hopefully you learn from this, but based on the deleting of comments I doubt it.
Don't let the Muggles get you down! This looks delightful, thanks for sharing this. What a great match-up of English Breakfast and the Hogwarts Universe! Just like the Great Hall <3 You're the best, Babish!
Very health breakfast, Notttttttt.
never thought babish would promote a transphobic and racist game lol
Hey, Hogwarts Legacy is very transphobic and antisemetic
It's just missing HP sauce, and also a full English is made with hashbrowns and not bubble and squeak
thanks for admitting you don't care about trans people!
Unnecesary downvotes.
I wish you wouldn’t promote a game created by a transphobic terf.. but ah well. loved the content apart from that.
Very disappointed about your choosing to accept a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy. It shows a certain willingness to ignore Jewish and transgender voices in order to turn a profit. Will be unsubbing.
This is a video game ad on a cooking channel. This was an intentional choice on BWB team’s part, not some innocent oversight. You told us where you stand, and I’ll tell you where I stand. Unsubscribed.
Hey babish, I’ve been watching and supporting you for years, but this is a hill I will die on. Hogwarts Legacy is not something you should be supporting for ads. Rowling is human trash, her beliefs support the dehumanizing of people that have done nothing to hurt her, and this is a horrifically bad look for you man; you’re better than this.
The sponsorship for this vid is a bummer. Guess I'll wait for the next video
I trust you a lot less knowing you support and are supported by Hogwarts Legacy. incredibly disappointing.
You guys should know better than to take a sponsorship like this. Do better.
Very disappointed that you took up the sponsorship with this video game. Im sure a lot of other companies would of loved to give you their time than a game which's concept is absolutely drenched in antisemitism. Do what you would like, but I will not be supporting you moving forward.
Very disappointed, used to recommend this channel to my friends but how can I when u promote a game that funds violence against them. Really saddens me to so see you cultivate such a diverse space and then just abandon the trans community like this.
Professor Fig dies at the end no matter what ending and also Rookwood cursed Anne and framed the goblins
Love the spineless support for the new hp cash grab!
Don't take money from terfs man. This ain't it.
Been a subscriber for many years, no longer. Do better.
Unsubscribed. Everybody in the production team has just made it very clear where their morals stand when money is involved. Deplorable.
Bubble and squeak is not part of a full English… no one in the UK uses a potato ricer… separate your sausages… you don’t do fried bread like that… we do sunny side up… it’s not “blood sausage”, it’s black pudding… this is upsetting
Trans fan here, unsubcribing. Please do your research on your sp*nsors
I have to unsubscribe, this sponsorship is a terrible decision.
Very sad to see you supporting hogwarts considering I've been a trans fan of you for many years. I will be unsubscribing. I hope one day you learn that your action has consequences and time is running out for trans lives.
Delicious!!! Love from the UK!
'Hopefully its authentic', very first component is something never served as part of a full english lol
very disappointed in this sponsorship, you've invited a lot of cruelty here
Eggs aren't flipped we love a runny yolk to dip in.  Basically you've just messed it up but nice try
Not the transphobia game
Bless you it's not full English it's called black pudding not blood sausage as the ingredients are different.. vine tomatoes really ? Dude stick to american food
I know sponsors make you money. But as an LGBT person with trans loved ones, seeing a video with this game that supports JKR, who is extremely anti-trans, is horrible and very disappointing. Not to mention the rampant anti-semitism in this game is a reason to not be sponsored by it- BCU is a comfort for me but not so much anymore. Please think twice on the sponsor next time! Thank you for reading.
Terf game:(
Cringe
For the hash browns I tend to grate a potato, microwave it with some butter until it loses the raw potato flavour but isn't *cooked*. Add salt and pepper and some corn flour/water mix then shallow fry in the pan before cooking the eggs. Really nice and they don't lose the slight bite of the McDonald's style hash browns
To all those that are "Disappointed" at Andrew's choice of sponsor, did you forget that this is a cooking show? And that Hogwarts Legacy is just a game? Even if you don't like JK Rowling that has nothing to do with Andrew and his content. I watch content from many creators, some of which I would disagree with wildly on certain topics, but I don't let that impact my enjoyment of their other content
Full Scottish breakfast next please
I don’t know whether this will be seen, but it’s worth saying something. I’m a trans person living in the UK, and this episode being supported by Hogwarts Legacy means that money is actively being used from this episode for funds that try to erase my existence.   I’ve watched Babish for years, through kitchen changes, and I never thought that this channel would support something that is antisemitic, transphobic, and harmful to so many communities.  And it was actually Rookwood who cursed Anne.
botched by babish TWO ways (supporting a product that funds transphobic legislature in the uk AND straight up getting the breakfast composition wrong)
A full American breakfast may not be available at Hogwarts, but it’s definitely available at Ilvermorny
Basics with Babish the best cooking Show
Disappointing to see someone with as much influence as you do take a sponsor deal to market a product that puts money in the hands of bigots.
For your next video you should make the duck cake from Bluey
I just have to say, seeing you support vocal antisemitism and anti-trans rhetoric is heart breaking. You and your associates have broken the trust of many people, myself included. A public apology would be too little and too late. I will no longer watch your content, goodbye.
Bubble and squeak is reserved specifically only for post Christmas dinners
As a trans man, I love Babish. I HATE that he accepted a sponsorship for HP stuff.
dissapointing choice in having this sponsorship
well it was fun while it lasted, disappointed and ashamed.
Unsubscribed. Really disappointed in this choice.
blood libel moment
I'm so sorry that I won't be able to watch Alvin anymore, because this was not his choice at all, but I can't support you or your channel if you are going to align yourself with a woman who has explicitly said on Twitter she is actively trying to destroy trans lives with the money earned from this franchise. I'm so very disappointed in you, Babish. Everyone in my house has unsubscribed.
Does the "big pool of bubbling butter" part remind anyone else of Mcgonagall's "babbling bumbling band of baboons" quote, (hogwarts legacy ad involved and all) OR is it just me? No? ok..
JK Rowling did nothing wrong. She is correct, men cannot become women and women cannot become men.
I tried playing Hogwarts Legacy and for some reason, it immediately transferred me to a surbubia and forced me to mow the lawn? What's weirder is that all the NPC characters started calling me Juan Takochusday despite the fact that I'm 100% Filipino? Idk its kinda weird.
The difference between top comments and new comments is very telling
I guess a juicy sponsor deal was more important than a portion of your fanbase feeling welcome in your community.
Very disappointed in your choice of sponsor, unsubscribed
Ad for Hogwarts Legacy? Yikes
Ah yes a full english breakfast including transphobia and antisemitism
Hogwarts has 13 million sales , 13 million!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Oh dear 😬 bummed to see a promotion for that game here of all places. Between JKR's transphobia and the flagrant antisemitism, I'm afraid that's an unsubscribe from me.
Was the Bigot Money worth it?
Very disappointing to see you promoting a game based on antisemitic blood libel and an author that supports state transphobia. I've been subscribed a long time but this will not stand for me.
the comments you get in SUPPORT should be enough evidence that accepting this sponsorship was a mistake. when the people celebrating your choice make it clear they are doing so because they think it indicates that you hate the same people they do, you probably should realize there is no casual or harmless way to side with them, even if that wasn't the intention.
Unsubscribed after having been subscribed since you started your channel. Disgusting and disappointing.
hogwarts legacy :(
looks great, keep it up!
Deleting comments that disagree with you is shady. Thought you were better than this. You've lost so many subscribers. Is the blood money worth it?
Nailing it with the British transphobia 💀💀💀
I was so disappointed to see the sponsor and am unsubscribing. I hope the money was worth it.
Not cool :( Pls don't support transphobes.
Really disappointed in your choice of sponsor. This has been a favorite channel for years, but I'm unsubscribing.
I thought better of you, man...
Unsubbed. Enjoy the money
Babish supporting anti-Semitic media for the bag I guess
England conquered nearly the entire planet and decided to use none of their spices
Hey man, I have followed you for years and bought books for not only myself but family and friends. You taking this sponsorship is disappointing to say the least.
Should have taken one of those raw tomatoes and put it on your nose, clown.
Unsubbing, hope the sponsorship money was worth turning your channel into a safe space for transphobes and antisemites. For someone who marries pop culture with cooking, there's no way I can reasonably believe that you or your team wouldn't know the real harm that JKR does with the money and platform she receives whenever someone shares her IP.
Thank you for making your opinions about Jewish and Trans people clear. Extremely dissapointed.
Taking a Hogwarts Legacy promotion? That's really disappointing. I love your channel but I wish you hadn't agreed to this.
Accepting money from the terf game? I'm out dude, heavily disappointed in you.
Great video, just bought your knife and saute pan. They are easily the best things in my kitchen now. Keep up the great work!
I’m frankly appalled that you took a Harry Potter sponsorship. I’ve been a subscriber for years, I’ve loved your videos but I cannot support bigotry. I don’t think you’re a transphobe, but after years of knowing that Jk Rowling is a massive terf, I think people would know better than to accept her money. Goodbye, hope you can realize how this is bad and apologize.
Wow. Cool ad.
The game's not antisemitic. You guys need to grow up and learn to accept other people's opinions.
While I previously enjoyed your channel quite a bit, that streak ended today. The fact that you're comfortable taking money to shill antisemitic propaganda galls me. I think I'll be sticking with Max Miller's output from now on.
babish wizard embarrassment ⚧
you should be ashamed.
I am very disappointed in you.
Disappointed you're taking a sponsorship on harry potter
more like bigots with babish - really disappointed andrew and team took this sponsorship to promote the game to his absolutely massive audience.
Great, well get another Botched episode out of this one. 👏
Managed to avoid looking at the trending tab on Twitter for a while, huh?
Aand just like that you've lost all your integrity. After six years of watching you I'm sad this is the reason I'm unsubbing
Wizard game is antisemitic. For shame, Babish
(your professor always dies at the end) Just saying that Hogwarts legacy promotes the transphobic agenda of JKR in addition to having antisemitic tropes as major plot points. I would've expected better from a major YouTuber
I’m just sad I have to stop supporting you because I stole your stellar brownie recipe. Hope that you know you’re losing a lot of support and might only have a small chance of seeing it come back if something is said… Even then, this is pretty damaging for yourself and the fidelity of your viewers…
Unsubscribed. Feels like I've watched you forever but until you address this sponsor and make amends I can't justify supporting you. Send this episode's profits to Mermaids or something. JKR is a transphobe and this game is antisemitic AF. Shame!
Very disappointed to see Babish schilling for TERFs.
Looks delicious, but as others have said bubble and squeak isn't usually served with a full English and fried eggs are NEVER flipped over like that here. That's an American abomination.
bubble and squeak is never in a full English - 9/10 for the rest of it though, all pretty spot on
Hey Andrew just heard your interview on the radio today on 98.5 and absolutely loved it! Loved how in depth you went into your whole story, keep doing you and dont get too burnt out!
Please stop calling it blood sausage. No one calls it blood sausage.
Hey just saying it's kinda extremely disappointing to see this sponsored by the wizard game :/  I understand that nostalgia is a very strong motivater but the trans and Jewish people alike have spoken out about this game and it's very real, and heart breaking flaws and I guess it's just hard to see someone you enjoy profit off of something that does hurt us. The money she gets from this game, and plenty of her other books actively goes towards funding towards anti trans legislation and hate speech campaigns that genuinely risk so many lives who are just trying exist. It's really not that hard to not play a game....
Had to unsubscribe when I heard about this sponsor. Pretty disappointed. I thought you were better than this, honestly.
The people on Twitter malding over the Hogwarts sponsorship have me rolling; based Babish taking the W for supporting smaller devs.
Hey man, I'm a big fan of this show, have been for a while. I can't say I'm not a little disappointed that you've taken money to promote a game that has a ton of controversy related to it, both in terms of the relation of the property to an outspoken and influential transphobe and the blatant anti-semitic content in the game (like references to a 1612 uprising of goblins, who in themselves are already Jewish stereotypes, that directly correlates to a Jewish uprising in Germany, which feels incredibly specific and targeted)  I hope you've been as of yet unaware of the controversy, but that you are able to address it properly on one of your platforms.
Using the oven tho... It's called a fry up for a reason.
I love your videos but I'm going to have to reconsider watching and subscribing to you. Really disappointed that you would take money from and promote something antisemitic and transphobic
welp this is disappointing.  Andrew i can't watch content made by someone who'd take money to advertise a product made by and to benefit fascism.  i hope you see the errors in your ways and avoid aligning yourself with fascists from now on , but for now i have to unsubscribe.   sincerely , someone who has been following you for almost 6 years.
I would love to see Babish make haggis and blood sausage from scratch
so very disappointing to see you take money from rowling. sad you dont put marginalized people over profits. this vhannel was going downhill already this is just the nail in the coffin. unsubbed!
Like the video but disappointed in the sponsor
you have to make 12 Krabby Patties on Wheat Buns
Genuinely really disappointed in you, man. All of the money this game makes goes directly to anti-trans orgs and lobbying against Scottish independence, and if you stand with these things, I'm gonna have to unsub.
Really disappointed you've decided to accept money from a company that actively funds anti semetic and anti trans hate.
Disappointed in you for giving the antisemitism game a platform, Babish.
Gained my sub. Congrats!
was a longtime fan, this channel has warmed my heart so many times. devastated to see you take this sponsor, which is actively antisemitic and funds trans genocide. as a trans person it was like a jumpscare. I couldn't stop thinking about the risk of getting murdered like so many already have been, the barriers I face to receiving necessary medical care, & about how I can no longer legally travel to Tennessee to see my family. so while the food content itself looks interesting, I wasn't able to stomach it. I really hope you address this
Very disappointed by the sponser, will be unsubbing now.
Yuk - taking money from WB and lining JK’s transphobic agenda. Shame on you.
Aww, dude, no way. Babish got sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy. I like the Wizard game. He has earned my sub.

Lot of simps in these comments who are real cocky for people who haven't read a book since they were 13.
Extremely disappointed to see this sponsorship from you, Babish & Co. Have unsubscribed.
It's sad to see you supporting J.K.Rowling.
The fact that nobody in the comments is talking about the HL sponsor is insane to me. Feels like comments are getting deleted. Anyway, I'm unsubbing.
thanks for telling your trans and jewish followers that you don't care about them.
Oh no, looks like some viewers got angry over 10 second sponsor clip of a game that is based on a series with a leftist author that has nothing to do with the game and holds almost militant feminist views, but dared to make a few of the most vanilla and cookie-cutter comments about how trans-women and women are distinct. Be careful not to get cancelled! I swear even kindergartens have more self-awareness and critical thinking than these people.
Bubble and squeak on a full English Andrew?? Hash browns but not the American shredded ones, frozen triangles of fried mashed potato’s are the better option!
muuuaaaa 😛😋🤤
Honestly disgusted that you guys accepted a sponsorship for Hogwarts legacy. I doubt you guys have no clue about it at this point. Great way to support your Jewish, trans and black fans.
it's the semi anglo
i find it hard to believe babish and friends had no idea about the controversy behind hogwarts legacy…pretty disappointed that was all ignored just to accept a sponsorship.
heartbreaking to see the sponsor at the start, been such a big fan for years
Professor Fig dies at the end no matter what ending and also Rookwood cursed Anne and framed the goblins.  Trans and Jewish lives are more important than whatever nostalgia you have for a franchise made for elementary schoolers.
My guess is this whole deal was signed and filmed bought and paid for before Babish knew this wizard stuff would be controversial. They just chose to upload it too and I respect that.  Especially considering there were probably relatively significant contractual obligations involved.
why don't you accept criticism !
Absolutely heartbroken that y’all have sold out to JKR.
You really didn't need to take money from a person who is an anti Semite and transphobe. You already had enough money, there's no way they paid you enough to excuse how horrible she is. Pathetic.
You will never be a real wizard. You have no wand, you have no spells, you have no mana.
To all People who are attacking Babbish. Don't bother commenting on this video and leave. A lot of us don't need people that attacks anyone who either support or genuinely likes Hogwarts Legacy. A lot of you attacked Silvervile, an innocent VTuber, for playing Hogwarts Legacy, a game which is based on something she likes and now you attack Babbish who is just doing his job.  A lot of you are idiots for not being able to separate the art from the artist. If you hate JK then hate JK, not on her work and anything related to said work and to anyone who genuinely is a fan of it.
Woof.
I expected more from you man.
Delete this comment too. You are complicit.
kinda disappointed in you for taking the sponsorship and advertising that game.  i understand you needa make money but cmon.
Why did you accept this sponsor? You don't need it. It's also 2023. You could and should have known better.
Edit: y'know what first I said 10k, then thought it was too much. Then 5k, also too high. 50 likes and I'll give someone a steam gift card, buy HWL or something else. Or I'll make a donation to a charity of choice to the winner, if they choose so.
also bubble and squeak is what you make with a leftover roast dinner e.g. on boxing day
also where's my cup of PG tips?
lol "blood sausage" you mean black pudding?
where's the hash browns bruv
My favourite breakfast ❤
Been a long-time subscriber. I really love seeing all the various vids to come out of this channel, the fictional foods brought to delicious life and the basics to teach you the basics of cooking, the hilarious and chaotic energy of the botched episodes. I've spent many evenings with Babish's voice in the background. However I am also transgender and I find it very hard to believe that no one involved with the channel knew about all the buzz surrounding the sponsor of this video. The game itself is also blatantly antisemitic to the point that the involvement of JKR- known transphobe, islamophobe, etc- should be irrelevant. It's very likely that this one viewer unsubscribing and no longer watching the videos from this channel will hold a big impact, but I know there's more than a few of us hurt by this choice.
Do a full scottish breakfast with white pudding, fruit pudding, tattie scones and lorn sausage
You are awesome babish never change!
I have to agree with sunny side up comments. The yellow of the eggs is a huge visual cue of classic English breakfast.
Bubble and squeak is made from leftovers and isn't part of a fry up
Never thought you'd take money from TERFs Andrew. Low key disappointed tbh...
Hey Babish! The sponsor of your video is an anti-Semitic game developed by an Alt-right YouTuber. Maybe you need to do some due diligence and not accept sponsorships from Nazis? Also, maybe take down the video/cut out the sponsor clip?
This was weird. It felt like this could have done without taking money from someone labelling all trans women as predators and aligning herself with far-right anti-abortion anti-LGBT activists.
people dickriding babish in the comments is actually crazy this man does not care about you or anyone else obviously
Will be looking forward to the the second 10m subscriber video...
You’re actively supporting anti trans organizations, by now you should know this very well working as an online creator. I’ve been watching for a long time and it saddens me so much that this is where your heart and priorities lie :(   I’m going to unsubscribe and block, it’s just so sad to see this is how you’re moving forward.
As a British man I fully endorse this breakfast.
Clown fiesta in the comment section
kinda sad to see Transphobia/Antisemitism The Game still getting so much hype 😔
Great video! You gained a new subscriber. Thanks for reminding me to buy Hogwarts Legacy — I look forward to playing the game!
Extremely disappointing choice of sponsorship
bibidy bobidy, hippity hoppity, your sponsor is a bigoted piece of intellectual property!
Bubble and squeak on a full English?! I’m 0.45 in and already furious
I watched you before the wizard sponsorship. Bye
You partnered with an anti LGBTQIA+ community, I can no longer support you.
It is incredibly disappointing to see you support something that is anti-trans people and antisemitic. This is not hard to research to find out why JK Rowling is problematic, down to the fact that she has openly said the profits for this game will support TERF action.   I genuinely find it shocking that people aren’t aware of all of this given the amount of media about it. At this stage, choosing to support this franchise is a conscious leaning towards hate and bigotry until you prove otherwise. Sorry dude but lots of us thought you were better than this.
Honestly this is closer to a botched. I'm sure it's delicious but it's not quiet what we would call a full English. We also just call them sausages most the time; not bangers.  More importantly though; deeply disappointed with the choice of sponsor for this video. If it was done without awareness of the game's wider context then I frankly find the ignorance a little astounding for somone that works on the web.  If it was deliberate then it's pretty agregious and rather at odds with the channels vibes. Either way it's a reluctant unsub from me. Solidarity with my trans siblings 💪
i wanted food not a TERF jumpscare at the start
Thanks for allowing a large chunk of your audience know you absolutely don't have our back. hope the dirty money was worth it. Disgusting
genuinely really sad to see this sponsor. upset but not surprised ig
Andrew this is disappointing. If you truly care about your community you would opt out of this sponsorship instead of taking money doing ads for the transphobic anti-semitic video game franchise. Unsubscribed.
It's very interesting that lining your own pockets it's much more important than supporting the trans community
From the blood sausage (normally called Black Pudding) you really want the Stornoway Black Pudding it's 100x better than the normal supermarket stuff.
cringe and lose subscriber
No, no, no to the bubble and squeak. Fried eggs are always sunny side up. Plus some nice stewed tinned tomatoes wouldn't go a miss.
Based
I am genuinely so surprised and bummed. I saw Girlfriend Reviews video and it made a lot of sense and was kinda sad, but full on taking endorsement from them is something else. It’s making a statement, and it’s one I don’t like. :c bye, Andrew
As much as I love your content, Andy, and as much as you have the right to accept whatever sponsorship you like... did it have to be one full of antisemitism and racism that directly lines the pockets of a TERF and wd made by far-righters?
I think it's kind of messed up too how many blatantly transphobic/antisemitic people are defending your decision to take this sponsor, and yet the comments getting deleted are by trans/Jewish/allies trying to let you know how bad this game is :/ really shows where ya stand huh.
Andrew I want to thank you for being one of the people that made me fall in love with being in the kitchen. I've watched every video on this channel at least once except for a small handful so it pains me to see you take a sponsorship from the same mind that made me skip those few episodes in the first place. I'm forever grateful for everything I've learned here but i can't support someone who supports a person that hates people like my friends for simply existing
With all due respect, which is none, I'm incredibly disappointed - you shouldn't have agreed to that Hogwash Legacy sponsorship, because you SHOULD NOT PROMOTE ANYTHING TO DO WITH J. K. ROWLING. You might not care, but a lot of people did, do and WILL care
hes filtering all of the comments that use the the word tr*nsphobia, *tr*ns, this sucks Babi, you can make a mistake, just admit it , apologize, donate the money and move on. J.K rowling is using her royalties to harm an already vulnerable group, don't help her, don't sell this game
I can't believe you would allow yourself to be sponsored by a game that is so obviously antisemitic. I couldn't watch any of this
I’d probably not put Bubble and Squeak in a full English, but I do like it. However, if you think that name is delightfully whimsical, you’re gonna lose your mind over Scotland’s very similar Rumbledethumps.
Dissapointing that you chose this sponsor. Unsubbed.
I'm disappointed.   Not because of the sponsorship, Hogwarts Legacy is a 9/10.   I'm disappointed there's no gun with the American version.
PROFESSOR FIG DIES IN THE END AND YOU CANNOT CHANGE THIS AND ROOKWOOD CURSED ANNE
unsubed for bigoted sponsor product
Also I have held my tongue as a fan but I hate your beard
As a trans person and long time fan, i'm dissapointed to see your support for Rowling and this game
Really disappointed in you Babish, taking a stand against all of your trans and jewish fans is really messed up of you. You should do better in the future, this is really sad, dude. I hope you address this soon, I'll be letting my friends know to avoid your videos in the future though. Thanks for siding with nazis.
This comment will probably be deleted… Anyway. That’s a shame. I liked these videos, but I draw the line at supporting transphobia.  Well, there’s other cooking channels.
Unsubbed.
Well this is disappointing. I'm not launching a diatribe but I'm very disappointed. Also I would love to see the ratio on this one
Missing the toast and fried slice and milk tea
Super disappointed man
@babish cartoon network apple and onion lime leaf velvet cake. Poster in the background of episode S1 E11 4.17 minutes time stamp. I thought it could be fun! Maybe cartoon food with Alvin or something?
cringing with babish
Im unsubscribing because of your sponsorship with the harry potter game. Also heard that comments mentioning the bigoted mature of the game were getting deleted. The plot of the game is blood libel. You have enough money that you didnt need to take this sponsorship.
Extremely disappointed with the sponsor. People have discussing the problems with this game for months, and the harmful stereotypes it is perpetrating and the problems with the people who have created it. To accept a sponsor for this game is, frankly, embarrassing. Who in here started saying cringing with babish, because I'm with them.  While I don't usually see the point in mentioning this, as generally nobody really cares, I am going to mention that I will be unsubscribing, because this is absolutely unacceptable.  Great job at making minority viewers of your content feel unwelcome and unsafe, while also letting bigots seemingly feel welcome and allowing them to run wild in your comments section.
Well this is disappointing.
You should try making some of the sandwiches from bobs burgers “roamin’ Bob-iday.” Patricia’s 77 sandwiches!
Professor Fig dies at the end no matter what and also Rookwood cursed Anne and framed the goblins.
unsubscribed because youre taking terf money.
Deeply disappointed you've chosen to work with Hogwarts Legacy's sponsorship. It's a grossly antisemitic project and I'd assumed you were a better person than to align with that kind of ideology for money.
Just started watching you again recently, trying to catch up on what i missed so to see this. That you accepted an ad from media that the person who made it says if you like or support said media, then you are supporting her ideology (tran-hate and bigotry). This makes me sad
very dissapointed in you for the sponsor. i didnt think you would be ok with a game made by a transphobe with blatant antisemitism in it, but i guess i misjudged you.
Gordan Ramsay brought me here. Watch the video of James Corden and Gordon Ramsay making their version of this, it’s hilarious
Must be nice being a cis white man not having to stress about people campaigning for your annihilation from society.
You guys have no right to be disappointed or mad at all. Honestly none of you here are actual allies, you're just weirdos who want to feel morally superior to someone over a video game. How about you all go out and actually help the people you so valiantly feel the need to defend or is that too much work for you? Of course it is you'd rather harass content creators online over a game than actually be helpful. Also most trans/jewish people don't actually have a problem with this game so how about you stop trying to speak for a whole group of people.
Really genuinely disappointed to see the sponsorship for Hogwarts Legacy, a game with a flagrantly antisemitic plot line from a franchise made by a racist transphobe. Anyway, Professor Fig dies at the end no matter what and also Rookwood cursed Anne and framed the goblins.
disappointed to see you sell out for a game that financially supports a hateful, transphobic creator
Unsubbed. You should be ashamed.
Honestly I'm going to unsubcribe. As a member of the lgbtq community, I believe that supporting a game created by a transphobic and antisemitic writer (jk rowling) is disgraceful. I'm sure you are aware of her hurtful and harmful comments and actions. Do better and stop supporting activity harmful reterics by supporting those who promote them.
Added the wrong ingredient in hopes people will focus on that and not the Harry Potter sponsorship.
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  can’t believe you support a terf
I should not be watching this before bed, my stomach is craving food now 🤤
If I see another ad for Hogwarts Legacy on this channel I'm unsubscribing.
YOUR TEACHER DIES IN EVERY ENDING ROOKWOOD CURSED ANNE
Well... this is a very disappointing sponsor for you to take on.
Subscriber for years, leaving now because of the sponsorship.
cringing with babish. massive embarrassment taking that sponsorship my guy. 💀
Professor Fig dies at the end no matter what ending and also Rookwood cursed Anne and framed the goblins. I hoped better of you.
Really disappointed in you taking this sponsorship given the harm the franchise is causing to trans people around the world, one such place especially being in England. I hope you just didn’t know. It would mean a lot if you would address this at some point, at least in some small way. Please don’t just ignore the lives of trans people you’ve, hopefully accidentally, participated in harming with this.
Well guess that’s it for my subscription. I’ve been enjoying this channel but seeing the sponsorship on this video is too upsetting for me. 😭
A voice amongst millions, but I'm so sad you took this sponsorship. I've been a watcher for years now, but it has to end with this. I hope you fare well in the future, Andrew.
Very disappointed in the sponsorship.
Well, that's disheartening and extremely disappointing to see from BCU.
HERE TO SHOW SUPPORT BROTHER. NEVER HEARD OF YOUR CHANNEL BY I SUBBED AND LIKED A FEW VIDEOS. DONT BEND THE KNEE TO THE TWETTER MOB!!! 🧡🖤🧡🖤🧡🖤🧡🖤🧡🖤
Extremely disappointed by this sponsor.
Came for the horrified Brits and the offended Canadians, unsubscribed for the sponsorship.  Do better, Babish.
I thought you were better than this. I’m so disappointed
this is really dissapointing :-((( was hoping you were an ally to trans + jewish people but i guess the sponsorship money is better than supporting marginalized groups experiencing extreme levels of hatred in the us right now.
Really disappointed in your support for this game. Have been subscribed since the early days but I’m unsubscribing now. Learn from this and do better in the future for your own sake
chef john would never sell out to a bigot like this lol
i'm so sorry to every single trans and jewish person who thought they could trust a wholesome food channel to not bank on their dehumanization and were ultimately disappointed. we deserve better
Ah, that's... really disappointing. Really puts a ding in what has been a history of wholesome kindness and acceptance.
I'm incredibly disappointed you have associated yourself with that TERF.
Truly and severely disappointing, I loved this channel but I have to unsubscribe because promoting a completely antisemitic trash game from a transphobic bigot is just so far out of line from what I've come to expect from this channel. I hope the money was worth it. But we all already know it's not.
Cringing with Babish, ive been a loyal subscriber for years but this is too much goodbye BCU
Nope. just nope. with this sponsorship, i'm out of all your stuff completely.
sponsored by who??? dude, really disappointing :/
If you didn't accept transgender and jewish people in your audiences you can just say so, no need to sell out for some sponsorshit
Whelp, I've been a subscriber for years but this video just earned you a block. I hope the transphobe and antisemite money and cultivating transphobic and antisemitic audience was worth it.
Yeah this sponsor is disappointing. I'm out.
i love you babish, but im a little disappointed with the sponsor :(
trans and jewish people deserve love, support, and respect.
Cringing with Babish. Babish terf support embarrassment.
😟
Really sorry to see this sponsor. I hope you donate that money to trans charities and try to rectify this.
I'm severely disappointed that you would willingly take money from a game that directly supports real world transphobia while also showcasing antisemitism.  Apparently your team is deleting comments too, and if that's the case then I'm truly, disgusted. Because this would go beyond ignorance, It is actively silencing criticism. It's obvious that at least your staff is aware of the problematic nature of this game, yet making a quick buck is more important than trans lives apparently.   Needless to say, I have unsubscribed. And I recommend everyone else do the same.
cringing with babish
HEY BRO? WHY ARE YOU TAKING MONEY TO PROMOTE A GAME THAT IS STRAIGHT UP BLOOD LIBEL BRO? BRO????
Yeah that’s an unsubscribe from me dawg
Really heartbroken that you've chosen to take money to support a transphobe's platform - and that you or your team are clearly deleting comments about it. Unsubscribed after many years of support. Thanks but no thanks.
Have to say, quite disappointed that you accepted money to promote that transphobe's  antisemitic game. Pity, your food would have been tasty to look at without that foul taste from that
I freaking love bangers and mash, its my go to whenever I go to themed pubs. I need to make this whole thing one day, it always looks amazing
Granted that Babish might be offline enough to not know why it might be bad to run this ad, it's fascinating to me that a whole team signed off on this. BwB is not one person. A whole bunch of people said "yes" to this and surely some of them knew that they were plunging themselves into the transphobia discourse by doing so.
Baseeeeed
Any other original comments from the Tribe of the Tolerant? Please step up and keep posting your "disappointments".
Oh Andrew, I'm so sad right now
Next Botched by Babish should be this sponsor.
Yikes
me when i delete comments because i cant take critism over my sponsership choices
babish man, come on. a Hogwarts Legacy Ad?
Boo Hogwarts. HL ruined my childhood.
W sponsor
Not this sponsor ..
I've never been more bummed out by a sponsorship.
just a note for Americans, black pudding is brilliant and anyone worth their salt will have haggis on their full English 😮‍💨🔥
i hope you like the bed you've made. never watching another one of your videos. enjoy your bigotry money while it lasts.
promoting the TERF wizard game? Disappointing.
Extremely unfortunate sponsorship, don't think I can support the channel. I understand the need to make a buck, but not one tied to someone who so gleefully enjoys the pain and suffering of people trying to live. I'd think being an online personality that you're fully aware of the reason people are upset which just makes it all the worse. Food is inclusive, and instead you are hawking something that gives money to a rotten and hateful hag.
Unsubscribed. Very disappointed in blind support of hp content in 2023. Could give the benefit of the doubt you didn’t know better but you’re deleting all comments trying to inform you 🤷🏻‍♀️
I don't think I can put into words how much this video dissapoints me. I had been watching Binging with Babish for years, and this channel honestly got me through some of hardest times in my life. I ignored the other harry potter videos because of how much i loved this channel, but accepting this sponsorship is a step too far. J. K. Rowling is a transphobic, antisemetic individual who has stated that her income from this game will be going to violent transgender hate groups, and the whole plot of the game is seriously damaging to the jewish community. I can't keep ignoring that. It sounds childish, but you've lost a subscriber.
Uh oh! Bad decision, Babish!
You should do the full Scottish breakfast
Disliked and unsubscribed. Goodbye forever, Babish.
Feels bad leaving behind a channel I've watched for years. Ah, well.
And unsubbed Y_Y you should know better
Lol bye
binging with babish more like bigot with babish
Was very excited to watch a new ep, but will not be supporting this time. Sad move Babby :(
Ah
As a trans and jewish fan, I am very disappointed in your choice of sponsor.
A full English breakfast would keep me full for the entire day!
Wow did Babish actually make a blunder worthy of apology? This is interesting. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt for now.
Very disappointed by the sponsor. JK Rowling explicitly dedicated her income from this game to support violent transphobic groups in the UK and beyond.  Even if you didn't know, having someone remove critical comments is disquieting. This definitely put me off watching your videos or supporting the patreon, at least pending some appropriate response.
lol half the comments are angry about Hogwarts Legacy and the other half are angry about the Bubble and squeak. if you are angry about Hogwarts Legacy, grow up..........
A harry potter sponsor read? I'm genuinely disappointed. trans people are under attack, and lending your platform to a world created by an avowed and prominent anti-trans bigot speaks volumes. I've been subscribed for years, but that ends now.
You have posted cringe sponsorship, and you are going to lose subscriber
Babish, please ignore the bunch of idiots who are trying to cancel you over your sponsor. People are making a big deal out of nothing. You have a supporter in me
very, very, very gross to partner with the transphobic antisemitic blood libel simulator game, and to remove all the trans-friendly comments from this video. i've been a subscriber for years and i'm out. i'm so disappointed
Hey, the people who make that game are horribly transphobic, the game is deeply antisemitic, and you probably shouldn't be taking money from these people and promoting a game that is fueled by hate
Disappointed in your choice of sponsor
shame.
Really disappointing to see Babish advertising for Hogwarts Legacy.
:(
noooo the sponsor 🫠 didn’t have unsubscribing to babish on my 2023 bingo card but here we are
I know ya gotta get that money but there gotta be a better way than endorsing the terf transphobe game.
Keep deleting these negative comments.  Don't acknowledge them in the next video. Don't give these bullies an inch.
Hogwarts Legacy? Binging with Based
so are all the comments questioning this sponsorship just getting deleted? that’s disappointing
I have to laugh all these slacktivists trying to claim the goblins are a stereotype of Jews when anyone that's actually played the game will quickly see they're actually supposed to represent a Dickensian working class being treated unfairly by the out of touch aristocracy (wizards)
Here to support Babish when a small segment of the internet is losing what mind it had regarding Wizarding Game
so is everyone in the comments just going to ignore the transphobia sponsorship
Disgusted to see the sponsor for this video. Unsubscribed.
I’m trans sorry babish
smell ya later.
That’s a shame. I always appreciated you Andrew, but shame on you.
'I hope I don't get in trouble for this, but an authentic...'  Shall we tell him...?
Heavily disaprove of you being sponsered with Hogwarts: Legacy, its awful and highly anti-semetic
Wasn't even going to be watching this episode but heard from elsewhere that you decided allying with transphobic antisemites is better than not having a bit less sponsorship money. I genuinely don't get the financial plan you had going, you have tons of sponsors, but weren't feeling any of them were driving off your subscribers who have an inch of morals? This is incredibly disappointing, more so that criticism is being hidden. I hope my and the millions of other people's subscriptions ending takes out more money than you got with such a disgusting sponsor, since it seems money is more important than the safety and well being of the people who watched your channel. have fun bigotry culinary universe i guess
Hope the check was big enough to be worth losing the support of your Jewish and trans fans. Unsubscribed
🤔Bubble and squeak, British yes but not Full English Breakfast - hashbrowns are the one but you've definitely left me hungry 😂🇬🇧
not loving the sponsor deal
Wholly disappointed in the choice of sponsorship, and is the team deleting comments that bring it up? If so, that’s even worse.
Hey this sponsor really sucks! Super disappointed!
Really disappointed to see you promote something that funds a dangerous hate movement. Thought you’d be better than this.
:/
As a Jew and former fan of this channel, I am shocked, appalled, and hurt that you would take a sponsorship from a game that is helping a woman commit genocide against transgender people. I hope you realize the error of your ways and that the lives of every Jew and trans person worth so much more than harry potter
To not only take sponiship money but then also vocally endorse Hogwarts Legacy, after everything that's been said an done AND as a creator that is fairly connected to wider talk online... just. sad. Unsibscribed. :C
Disappointed in you for supporting this franchise :(
Transphobic antisemitic anti Scotland independence game. Cool.
"Professor Fig dies at the end no matter what ending and also Rookwood cursed Anne and framed the goblins"
Hate crimes with Harry
The betrayal of seeing the Blood Libel game ad :(
When everyone is playing the bigot game, I’m leaving this to remind my jewish and transgender friends that they are not alone, and to fight back
Extremely disappointed that you’re not standing with the trans community on this
Didn't she say she would put any money earned from the game into anti Scottish independence legislation and anti lgbt legislation? Super disappointed. Unsubscribed :(
i’m so beyond disgusted rn it’s not even funny
What a mess. Not only taking the money for this sponsorship but then deleting the comments calling you out for your morality? You’ve lost my respect and my sub
Guess you decided to really lean into the theme & pair the British ep with some transphobia. *immediate unsub*
im disappointed in you, babish. i cant believe you would take money over the lives of trans and jewish people. its sickening.
Very disappointed with this sponsorship from Antisemitism: The Game, featuring the Universe of Terfs.
what a slap in the face. did you really have to take that sponsorship?
As a transgender fan of your work, I'm really disappointed to see you advertising for Hogwarts Legacy
deeply disheartening seeing a sponsor from an IP that has bigoted themes embedded into it. please do better. for your jewish and transgender audience.
Can you make a full Irish Breakfast?
yikes
Are comments talking about the sponsor being deleted? I can't seem to find some of the ones I saw before 🤨
hogwarts legacy is implicitly antisemitic (via various aspects of portrayal of goblins) and explicitly funds transphobic bills via jkr and her platform. upset about this sponsorship.
Absolutely not here for platforming a game that directly finances a transphobic person.
I thought this comment section would be very different given this week's sponsor 😶
So disappointing.
Wow, genuinely surprised you accepted a sponsorship from a pos game like this. I didn't that yall were that desperate for funding.
more like bigotry with babish
oh this sucks actually. was a fan for a long time and it really blows that you’re taking $$$ from this horrendous game. thanks for the years of enjoyment and fulfillment and recipes. what the heck.
taking money from the TERF Queen? im out. i was following since your days in harlem, i had respect for you as a former vfx artist. this sucks, dude. but guess i'm not missing out on much if you're taking her money.
Basics with Babish is sponsored this week by Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby!
baffled by the choice of sponsor. why would you invite so much controversy in the first place?
unsubbed. incredibly dissapointed to see you take that sponsor
incredibly disappointed to see you supporting such a hateful and antisemtic property and its transphobic author
Can you please do the cake Sanji bakes for big mom's tea party?! Pleeeeease?!
Extremely disappointed in your choice of sponsor, Andrew. Transphobia and antisemitism is not okay. I would suggest taking this down ASAP.
And now to see andys version of the full scottish 👀👀👀
The world's gone mad, having a sponsor suddenly now makes you homophobic/transphobic just like that. Please someone tell me I'm dreaming, I myself dont agree with JK but jesus christ people jump into things just like that.
Disappointed in you for taking a sponsorship from a game that has blood libel as part of the main plot line. Don’t think I’ll be able to stay subscribed/watch your videos anymore.
Hey Andrew,  next how about a sponsorship from North Korea?
So disappointing that you’ve decided to get a sponsorship from Blood Libel and Broomsticks…  I’ve been subscribed for years, but it looks like this is where we part ways.
If you dont like blood sausage, find a Polish store and buy some kaszanka/kashanka. Its that but MUCH better 😉
Deeply disappointed in you for accepting this sponsorship
Ulster Fry > Full English
His last video from 3 days ago got 336k views. This video from yesterday has almost 500k. The hate has increased his views. Gotta love the backfire
Pretty disappointing sponsor bud
Babish, I admire you, and I acknowledge you gotta get that dough (pun only half-intended), but plugging that video game is just a bad judgment call.
hey mate that sponsorship with hogwarts legacy you got is not cool. as well as being overtly antisemitic its creator is also openly transphobic which has been known for Years at this point. you're alienating your jewish and transgender fans by supporting and accepting a sponsorship from this game.
Hey man, really disappointed to see you partnering with the Harry Potter game considering the views of the creator.
I decided to turn off the bell after the sponsorship. Came pretty close to the full unsubscribe, but I guess you have to make a living. Maybe pick a company which doesn't go to profit a woman who puts her money towards hate groups.
Out of all the sponsors y’all chose to take this one? Cringe
Cringing with babish
hello, person running the channel's comment sections. for however long this comment may exist, please at least consider passing it on to Andrew.  I and many other people are incredibly disappointed and betrayed by the channel taking this sponsor. I will be unsubscribing, and do not intend to watch this channel any more unless something changes. I understand taking sponsors for money, but this is one I wish you had skipped. I am upset to see that I am not welcome in this kitchen, and question now if I ever have been.  that is all.
Wow, really? Okay. Bye Babish.
It’s a huge bummer you took this sponsor. Wish you didn’t.
Dissapointed you took this sponsor. Not cool.
The crybabies sjws in the comment section never ceases to amuse me.
Games can't be transphobic/antisemitic you guys literally make stuff up just so you can harass people.
Was it the antisemitism, the islamophobia, the racism, or the transphobia that made you want to take this money?
Stay strong babish, great video as always
i am upset
did not forget transphobia, that's how you know its a proper englisf breakfast
Very disappointed to see this video promoting a game whose profits will unequivocally be funneled into the pockets of bigots. Do better, Babish.
I'm proud you took the sponsorship
Why would you accept anything to do with the wizard game? Are you aware it's aligning this channel with both antisemitic and transphobic rhetoric?
Full English is a hearty breakfast.
honestly disappointed that you took this sponsorship.
Ew you took a sponsorship from h******s legacy?? Unsubbed
I'm disappointed in you. Really? supporting J. K. Rowling at a time like this? You should be ashamed of yourself.
I hope the check was worth it man. I’ve been a fan of yours for YEARS and your siding with JKR? Have a nice life
Disappointed that a New Yorker such as yourself is accepting money from a wildly antisemitic project such as Hogwarts Legacy.
"Back" bacon is an oxymoron. "Bacon" already means "of the back"
it's not even a basic!!! why are you doing this!!!! jfc is the sponsor really worth it!!!!!
Hey Babish, don't let those mental crybullies harass & bully you until they make you bend over backwards just because you sponsored Hogwarts Legacy. I even plan on getting a copy of Hogwarts Legacy once the price drops. Please continue to entertain your fans without being harassed by those no-life crybullies.
Disappointed that you accepted money from a game rife with antisemitism. Not to mention, JKR's transphobia. Where's your moral backbone dude? Didn't expect you to sell out like this.
I hope Andrew that you are content with the horde of bigots and hate mongers that imagine they are on your side. I've just read and reported a comment from a bigot who is calling for the elimination of all Trans-People. Enjoy your blood money, maybe you should give all of it to a LGBTQ+ charity?
So disappointing you're giving publicity to bigotry
Why'd you take a Hogwarts Legacy sponsor? Do you not know about Rowling's rampant bigotry?
Very surprised at the lack of research on Banish's part. If only they spoke the same language in England, then maybe it would he less difficult to look up what's actually in a full English.
I get why these guys when to India for spices
cringing with babish
Severely disappointed in your choice of ad partner. You can do better than that Babish.
Loved your content for years, pretty disappointing to see who this video was sponsored by. You should have the awareness to know better
Let me guess, all the downvotes came from sad people who are mad about the sponsor. I can't imagine the English getting upset about these discrepancies. They're not Italians.
Looks incredible, just like the game. Thanks Babish! :)
I gotta say, I'm disappointed in the sponsor, even if this was agreed on long in advance JKR's bigotry has been known for a long time. I understand money needs to be made and I'm sure they offered plenty, but JKR has promoted Ideas that have directly led to trans people being targeted with hate and violence.   You've spoken of bringing people together with food, don't support those who divide and harm us.
Unsubscribing. I don't feel comfortable supporting a channel that associates with a woman known for using her platform to promote her racist, antisemitic, and transphobic worldviews.
been watching for years. didn't see this coming. goodbye
A bummer to see you throw in with supporting JK's legacy.
Ugh...it's been pretty clear for a while now that JKR is a total piece of 💩....It's not a great look to be repping her products....
sad to see that sponsor as a trans person :(
Unsubbing. You can't promote this game without promoting the racist terf that created it. I am disappointed to know that you are actively deleting pro trans comments.
Disappointed in the acceptance of this particular sponsor's money. It takes character to say no to blood money and I'll have to part ways with this channel since this act shows a callous disregard for marginalized peoples and there's no middle of the road in these matters
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Nah the bubble and squeak was a mistake bruv
That looks freaking delicious.
Babish bigotry embarassment
This is extremely disappointing. I love the Babbish universe, but supporting this game that lines the pockets of a TERF who is actively attacking our trans brothers and sisters?  I truly thought better of the Babbish team and community, this is extremely sad to see.
cringing with babish
I donno who told ya that's Canadian Bacon, but Canadian Bacon is not pre cooked, and what ya got there is definitely pre cooked and also rather heavily processed. And I don't see any cornmeal on the edges either.
Extremely disappointed to see you accepting a sponsorship from a horribly anti-semitic video game in a franchise whose creator is actively participating in and funding anti-trans ideology and legislature.
Oofa doofa, bad sponsorship
Sorry you're being harassed and bullied by fake trans allies over a video game.
Eggs over easy is a very American thing. The eggs ought to be sunny side up.
"Hogwarts legacy" yikes
I'm deeply disappointed in you Babish for taking a sponsorship for Hogwarts Legacy. JK Rowling is a horribly transmisogynistic and antisemitic person who has engrained her horrid ideologies and bigotry into every inch of Harry Potter, including the game. As a transgender person, it hurts me to see you not only taking this sponsorship but deleting other comments critical of your decisions. You should've known better. You no longer have my support.
A bit disappointed in the choice of sponsor. Not that I think Babish is transphobic or antisemetic, but it definitely makes those types feel more comfortable in the comments section of your vids. :(
I'm not going to assume you were entirely aware of the controversy surrounding the game, but I do recommend choosing one of the many other sponsorships I'm sure you have available to you. It's one thing to buy Hogwarts Legacy thinking your single purchase is inconsequencial, but another to get paid to directly endorse the content to millions of people. Regardless of JK Rowlings transphobia, the game itself is a giant anti-semetic dogwhistle made by not so great people. I really hope you were unaware rather than just didn't care. It would be strange to take a sponsorship from something y ou knew had very negative press.
Surely you could find a better sponsor than the antisemitic terf game?
Disappointed to see you support that game
Where did you get the blood sausage?? Friggin love that stuff!
Beyond disgusted and disappointed to see you supporting such an antisemitic game that funds the genocide of trans people in the UK. Hope you lose half your subs over this, mate, you deserve it
People who disliked are cringe
I’m really disappointed in your choice of sponsor, especially seeing you delete any dissenting comments. Absolutely shameful
Those eggs look deader than your professor at the end of every ending in Hogwarts Legacy (unavoidable)
another cringing with babish episode today. unsubbed!
I really don't get why you guys would take this paid promo. You have your pick of brands to work with and you choose to work with a brand that's making money off of anti-semitism and hatred of trans people. I've been subbed to you for years but I can't support this move personally.
Congrats on taking money from the disgusting transphobe jkr and their mediocre game unsubbed im sick of this
You're in trouble for both of those abominations
Are people seriously mad over this...?
Please don't accept sponsorships for or advertise the Howgarts Legacy game. It's doing a lot of damage to LGBTQ communities and those who unwittingly support it are helping prop up this movement of hatred and harassment against them. It's being seen as a rallying banner for extremists who want to genuinely harm people. I know this just seems like "silly wizard game" but there's a reason people are upset. People are being put in actual danger over this. Thank you.
bro i cant believe you sold out like this unsubscribed
Unsubbed, mostly just disappointed. As a jewish/trans person this telegraphs a remarkable disregard for my well being.
Well that sponsorship...is unfortunate.
Twitter freaks bigmad over funnay warlock game.
If I have to say something nice you guys are amazing at deleting comments
Seriously babish? There's a reason this game is being boycotted. This channel is better and you are better than this.
Really took money to promote Hogwarts.  TERFing with Babish
If you notice how all these people use the same sort of emotionally manipulative language to cry and shame over using this game, it's because they left their twitter safespace bubble where no one else cares about them, or "muh problematic author's hate crime game!!"  That's why they're so upset
Can you make a manwich from futurama
There's a Youtuber called Vlad Vexler, who recent talked about how successful people on YouTube lose their way, I never thought it would happen with a cooking channel.
"sponsored by hogwarts legacy" so we're cringing with babish now eh?
I'm disappointed in you for accepting a Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship with the series and creator's nosedive into transphobia and antisemitism :(
Watching this video was painful on multiple levels. I'm so sorry. Doing the right thing is easy... when there's no cost to it. The team could have spent more time researching the meal, and you could have just... not taken that money.
Genuinely surprised to see a partnership with this company, considering the incredibly antisemitic storyline and the direct harm JKR has done to the trans community. It reads poorly, and this isn't a case of removing the art from the artist, when the artist is using her royalty checks to fund anti-lgbtq+ bills and donate to foundations run by racists. I've been an avid fan of the Babish Culinary Universe for years, so this really sucks to see. It takes a lot, at this point in time, to not have seen the harm that JKR has done and still decide to accept her money.  It's a dang shame that folks want to pretend it doesn't matter ... a real lack of character/backbone.
It's too bad dislikes are hidden without a browser extension, so most people probably can't see the massive number of downvotes this has. Rest assured, though: The Babish team can fully see the ratio. :)
Now THAT is a breakfast.
You could of said no to the wizard game, but you did if anyways. Incredibly disappointing
Missed Worcestershire sauce in the Bubble & Squeak, also just blanch the cabbage you still want some bite in the cabbage. - just raises the taste to the next level in them
Welp. Time to unsubscribe. I've been watching for years too. Too bad. You just had to support the terf queen. Oh well... 🤦‍♀️
And the LGBT community loses their heads again for this. Keep it up, proud of you.
Ew sponsorship
Man, really disappointed to see Andrew get himself involved with JKR drama. Whether he agrees with her or not, shilling for a property that puts money in her pocket sends a message to his LGBTQ+ fans.
bigotry with babish
Disappointed in the ad, unsubscribed
Hopefully Botched by Babish will explain how he forgot to include the anti-Semitic blood libel plot in his ad for the game.
Really? Hogwarts Legacy. I could bear some of the other controvertial sponsorships but being paid by Transphobe McBloodLibel is too far. I'm disappointed. I really liked this channel.
Disappointed to see you taking a sponsorship from the wizard game putting money in bigots' pockets. Unsubbing, thanks for the recipes up to now I guess
Unsubscribing due to the sponsor. It's been real, but I'm incredibly disappointed.
Unbelievable youd partner with this company
Thanks for another fantastic video Andrew! Looking forward to doing an "authentic" English breakfast feast! 😅
Interestingly stark difference between this comment section and IG's. Methinks there's some modding/erasure of certain marginalized commenters afoot.
Another Canadian here, co-signing on “that is not Canadian bacon” 😅  Also, even I knew that bubble and squeak doesn’t go on a full English, and I’ve never been anywhere near England…
Dang you get a big sponsorship from the big terf game and you waste it on 🤢 British food 😭 Disappointed Babish.
Never seen a flipped egg in England.....   Bubble and squeak is a London thing but I lived there 10 years and never saw it on a full English.
disappointed that i won’t be able to enjoy babish content knowing you’re accepting money from noted transphobe JK Rowling & promoting her antisemitic game!! it was nice while it lasted, but i wish protecting vulnerable people was more important to you than another check
Please don't apologize for the sponsor it's not your fault people can't understand fictional stories and equate them to jewish people.
It's disappointing that you've chosen to work with this sponsor. I've followed your work for years, but I hear that criticism of this sponsor has been removed, so you're declaring which side your bread is buttered on, I guess. A shame.
Really disappointed that you chose to partner with the antisemetic propaganda game. I expected more from you. I've been subscribed for years. Not anymore though.
That's way too much for a breakfast x_x
Why would you take a sponsorship from the Blood Libel Simulator? This is disappointing
Not sure about the authenticity of the English breakfast but well done for standing up against trans activism
Unsubscribing bc of your choice of sponsor.
i unsubbed because of your sponsor, i don't want to watch people who still associate with harry potter in this day and age
I was always told that "Canadian Bacon" was basically what Canadians called "back bacon", but I'll admit that the back bacon presented here doesn't really look much like what I usually see sold as "Canadian". Also, I'm curious: does cooking the cabbage in the starchy potato water make a significant difference?
Come on, man. Accepting a sponsorship from the blood libel game that makes the TERF lady millions in royalties? Do better.
Love this channel, sucks that you took money from that game. Hard to support anyone who helps put money in a transphobes pockets.
😐
more like cringing with babish great job supporting a transphobe who wants people like me dead!
That is most certainly NOT Canadian bacon!!!
👎
Bro you took sponsor from cringe bro, you are going to lose subscriber bro
I've been a long-time subscriber and my family has always enjoyed watching your content together. However, today I'm unsubscribing due to your sponsor. The author of the HP franchise has been extremely vocal in her bigotry against trans and Jewish communities, among others, and I can't support any content affiliated with her franchise in any way. If you reconsider this sponsor partnership, I'd love to return to subscribing to your channel. Thanks for your consideration.
Why'd you do the Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship?
I know this comment will probably be hidden but I just want it to be explicitly clear that I’m unsubscribing because of who you accepted a sponsorship from for this video.  After following your work for years, this partnership (particularly in light of years of controversy surrounding the IP) comes as a slap in the face to your trans fans, like myself, because of JKR’s vocal and financial support of our eradication, and to your Jewish fans, because of how thoroughly antisemitic propaganda is woven into the game’s narrative.  You have chosen to accept the blood money of a hateful bigot to endorse and further the reach of her violent, antisemitic propaganda whose profits have been pledged to fund transphobic legislation in Britain. The lives of real people are far more important than milquetoast nostalgia bait.  Moving forward, due to this partnership, I will no longer be interacting with the Babish Cinematic Universe family of content, and will be encouraging my social circles to do likewise. I sincerely hope you do better diligence in vetting your future sponsors and take what you’re endorsing into deeper consideration.
very disappointed you took a sponsor from the transphobe blood libel antisemetic game cya
Words fail to convey how disappointed I am. Hope that sponsorship money was worth it.
This guy always gave me a weird vibe, so I'm not surprised to see he's taking a sponsorship from "the protocols of the elders of zion: the video game" and deleting comments pointing that out.
Been subscribed since your first year. Bye.
Not watching this channel again, you have supported and benefited from the genocide of trans people. SHAME.
I've been with your channel for years. I've loved watching everything you make. I know that Youtube is your full time job, and its where you make your income.   I still hope you seriously reconsider this sponsorship. I have never once felt unsafe in the comments sections of your videos- a rarity for Youtube. I cannot say the same right now. Beyond Hogwarts Legacy being built on a franchise created by an avowed, vocal transphobe, the choice to be sponsored by a game with such blatant, obvious antisemitsim, and to publish this video today- when people in my city and others are on edge because literal neo-Nazis are apparently planning a "Day of Hate" and "Mass anti-semitic" action tomorrow... This isn't it, Babish.   I truly don't believe you have any ill-intent. I am begging you to PLEASE listen when we tell you that you are worth so much more than being sponsored by something like this.
The sponsor is pretty disappointing ngl
Probably very few people will see this comment, and that's okay, I just want to express my disappointment that BWB took a sponsorship from Antisemitism: A Wizard Simulator game from noted author Joanne "The K stands for 'all trans people should K*** themselves'" Rowling, a game in which Professor Fig dies no matter which ending you pick, the player becomes the Keeper, and the "secret" ending in which the player's House wins the House Cup is triggered when you hit level 34.
Unsubscribed
:(
Ignore all the fake trans allies who think harassing/bullying people over a video game saves trans lives.
disappointed to see you accepting support from that game. I do hope I see a respectful and mature video rescinding on this support, but until then, i cannot accept this tacit support for the game and its bigoted messaging
As a trans person I'm absolutely disgusted. I hope the money was worth your integrity. It's so easy to simply not support these terrible people and you couldn't do this single thing as a show of support. Was every time you said this was a welcoming and inclusive community just talk? Do you know what this does to the communities who do this? The people it invites? Go look at the disgusting things the communities that have done this have turned into. Think hard about if this is what you want for this community.
This sponsored episode is so disappointing, figured that Babish would be aware of the anti-semetic nature of Hogwarts Legacy. Do better.
Long time watcher, first time commenter. Really disappointed about this sponsor and its links to JKR’s transphobia & the game’s antisemitism. I truly hope your team rethinks this one and addresses the misstep. Going to hope you genuinely were unaware but there has been so much news about this even recently… usually love your content & your team but please do better
Really disappointed right now. Used to love your videos so much, but as a trans person I can't just move along with the Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship. It's common knowledge that the people behind the game were transphobic, antisemetic, etc. and that every cent of revenue and advertising lines their pockets. You could've declined the sponsor, but you instead chose to take it. Genuinely really disappointing.
yall deleting comments calling out your nonsense too? rough. unsubscribing tastes delicious
ew
Really disappointed you’re doing this sponsorship deal, Babish. Helping fund TERFs is not the one.
English breakfast is the thing I miss most about the UK
really babish...you're supporting Hogwarts legacy...? and by extension JK?... for shame my friend...
Lives in England for grad school and never had bubble and squeak. The tomato’s were usually roasted and the eggs were sunny side up or just cooked to order.
Promoting that game is unconscionable. Shame on you.
"For Health" lolol
taking a sponsorship from a game with direct roots to antisemitism and transphobia is just about the last straw for me. i loved your content but thats an unsub. truly cringing with babish.
How does the TERF money feel?
really disappointed to see the antisemitic sponsorship
Cringing with Babish     Not like, cringing alongside or in solidarity with Babish, to be clear. Because of Babish.
this is a little disappointing 😬
I'm surprised babish was willing to take that Hogwarts ad. I don't think the game itself is transphobic, nor the people who made it, but the discourse around the game is obviously extremely divisive? Maybe that check was fatter than we would assume.
I've followed for many years now and enjoy many of the people that work on this channel but I'm outright disgusted you're taking money to push the queerphobic wizard boarding school game. You're big enough you can *absolutely* say no to the occasional sponsor without worrying about your finances, and even if you weren't a kinder more principled person *still* would've said no; this was a clear choice you made, and I hope you one day grow enough to come to be repulsed by the harm you chose to enable.
Woah the Closet Neonazis came out of nowhere because of harry potter?
Thanks for another great meal, Babish! Eventually ill try this one out but you definitely changed how i make meatloaf and its actually edible now too!
It feels disrespectful to see you accept money from the new Harry Potter game. With the creator being so outspoken against both trans and Jewish people, you are openly engaging with the same people who are punching down on disadvantaged communities.   Even if you claim that this is only about food, someone from New York should know the effect that the Jewish community has had on the food scene, and to take money from a game like this is a blatant disregard for those people.
Really disappointed you're partnering with antisemitic transphobes. :\ That's a huge downer, unsubscribed.
really disappointed to see you taking money from and advertising for a game that will continue to line a terfs pockets to use to continue hurting trans people.
Both meals look delicious ❤️
It’s devistating to hear you’re partnering with hog warts legacy and supporting people buying a game that will help fund anti trans bigotry. You’re the person that made me love cooking and it’s a gut punch to hear this….
Pretty bummed to see someone as seemingly progressive as Andy taking money from an antisemitic and transphobic game. He's got a lot of options of people to work with at this point, this doesn't seem worth it. Hope he reconsiders.
I love your work, keep it going ❤️
Great video and great food. Thanks for putting this out there you rock!
Disappointed that you would accept a sponsorship from a blatantly antisemitic game whose proceeds fund, in part, JKR's attacks on trans people. Unsubbing until an apology is made and the sponsorship money is donated to a relevant charity.
Thanks Babish for everything you do. Loved your content and continue to do so. Ignore the losers who are "disappointed" because you took a simple sponsorship.   Hogwarts Legacy is breaking sales records, your boycott failed.
Been a long time fan, but I'm hurt that you're taking money from & promoting Hogwarts Legacy. As another commenter put it, I'm worried that JKR's blatant transphobia isn't a dealbreaker for you.
So disappointing, immediate unsub
unsubscribed and unfollowed you and ur channel collaborators and crew on socials. cannot express enough the disgust and pain and disappointment im feeling right now. you should feel deeply ashamed of ever even considering this sponsor in the first place. this isnt a small issue, this is siding with growing and actively violent bigotry and rhetoric. youve lost a lot of long time fans and supporters. consider listening to your audience for once.
They wont but YouTubes automod might since you are literally saying harmful stuff
delete this comment if you hate trans and jewish people, babish and crew!
It's a shame you're taking a check from Hogwarts Legacy. Gonna give this video a miss.
Unsubbed due to sponsorship. Bummed out.
Imagine demanding someone sacrifice their livelihood for a group of people who not only bully and harass people over a video game, but also do nothing to help anyone but themselves. They want the world to revolve around them and they have no intention of showing kindness to anyone who isn't one of them.
Went to watch it, saw it had an ad for an anti-Semitic game made by some alt-right producers for a virulent transphobe, bye I don't care anymore
Not watching anything sponsored by IP that supports bigotry. You DO realise JK Rowling has said she considers anyone purchasing anything she's involved with as supporting her bigoted views, right?  Choose your sponsors better!!!
Sellout. Hope it feels nice compromising your morals for (more) money
i imagine comments like this are getting quickly removed en mass, but i'll still say that it's pretty disappointing that blatant transphobia isn't a dealbreaker for you
Ouch, I thought better of you Babish.
Before I die I want to fly to England just to have a proper full english. Sounds lame, but hey! :)
a hogwarts legacy ad? disappointing 😐
Extremely disappointed in this channel taking money from a bigot. JKR literally funds political policies that harm trans and jewish people. This tells me you do not do your due diligence when it comes to sponsors. I understand its a business but some lines should never be crossed. I hope you guys do better in the future.
Pretty disappointed in the sponsorship here :/
dissapointed in you for this one.
Bro, I never seen a babish video get so many dislikes so quickly, as of a day after upload, 18k likes to 7k dislikes  I can bet you its because of the Hogwarts Legacy ad
<sighs deeply>  Why did you have to include the TERF's wizard game. G'bye, Babish.
Immensely disappointing disgusting and disheartening and you know I’m not talking about the busted food
Who you callin a muggle?!
You accepting a sponsorship from this terf product is making me unsubscribe. I liked your content and I hope you don't agree with the hate that this game supports.
Imagine taking a sponsorship deal for an antisemitic and transphobic game.
What a disappointment this sponsorship is, I though better of you, and I was wrong.
Disappointed in you Babish. HL is actively fueling antisemitism and transphobia. Unsubscribed.
I'm disappointed to see who is sponsoring this video.
Very Basic.
Whelp, I'm sold on healthier cuisines. 👍
Disappointed that you would support a game that has clearly shown itself comfortable with antisemitism and pays royalties to a bigot funding harmful legislation.
I'm really disappointed by your decisions. Not a fan of transphobia or antisemitism. Unfollowed.
Well that was a massive jumpscare
for a fry up the egg shld be sunny side up
Apparently liking/playing video games makes you transphobic/antisemitic now.
I'm really disappointed to see you bringing politics into cooking videos by accepting this sponsorship. I would like to feel safe viewing your videos as a trans person.
Could someone explain all the angry comments to me please?
Very very disappointing, this video.
Taking money from that pathetic bigoted rot. Sad and despicable.
Wonder how these internet slacktivists are feeling now when they realize most people don’t 100% agree with them….
as a Jewish trans fan its intensely disappointing to see anything HP related on this channel at this point even if it's a sponsorship :((
Was supporting the transphobic antisemite’s game really the best choice here? A little disappointed tbh
I had no idea you're this much of a bigot. Glad to see you're showing your true colors though.
bigot with babish 😍
Way to take money from a transphobe and an antisemite! Enjoy your blood money!
Hope the money from antisemitic stereotypes: the game was worth it.
didn't know u were in support of an antisemite and terf. disappointed but not surprised
My trans partner literally introduced me to this channel! Atleast we finally know how you feel. :/  Rip
I'd appreciate it if, as a British guy, you didn't support the worst terf in the world to 'show off' our culture. Shame on you.
Nice sponsor, I can’t believe that professor fig dies in every ending and that rookwood is the one who cursed Anne and blamed it on the goblins 🤡🤡🤡
Disappointing you'd accept that sponsor. It's clear you don't care for the safety of Trans people.
Cringing with Babish.
Sponsor from Hogwarts is a no go.
Great video as always.
Well that's a heel turn I wasn't expecting
Really disappointed with the partnership
No bacon?
Disappointed by the sponsor. Who green lit this? Does nobody on the babish team have access to the internet?  I feel like the latest backlash against creators who played or are sponsored by this game would be well known. Sad in the extreme.
Most disappointing unsubscribe ice ever had to do tbh. Thought you cared for marginalized people more than this.
😡
Really surprised you guys took a sponsorship from the Harry Potter game (the sexism, racism, transphobia, and antisemitism has been known about Joanne Rowling and her IP for a while). Will be unsubscribing and canceling my cookbook order. Very disappointing
Yay Babish! I love the Full English and Blood Pudding. (It sounds gross, but it's really tasty)   (also: boo Rowling. She knows what she did)
Uh oh here come all the weirdos who think jewish people look like goblins.
yikes on the sponsorship......
Seriously? I have a hard time believing that, after looking at the complete toxic mess that is the discussion surrounding your sponsor, that you would actually take it.
disappointed in you for the sponsorship dude. Unsubscribing and spreading the word about it.
This is incredibly disappointing. I can’t believe you would endorse a game made by transphobic, racist and antisemitic people.  And to think I’ve been following you for nearly a decade.
Came for the food.    Subbed for the sponsor! 😂
Whats hilarious is all the babies crying over a game with a prominent trans character, losers. Get lost
Sell out im so disappointed you couldn't turn down the terf money.
I'm really disappointed that you would promote this game, supporting an active anti-trans agenda.
man the bubble and squeak was a weird addition to this meal. almost as weird as taking a sponsorship for hogwarts legacy considering it’s current reputation as the trnsphobic antisemtic game. maybe put a little more thought into your videos?
It’s comedy gold to see all these manchildren crying over an ad for Hogwarts Legacy 💀
not the hogwarts legacy sponsorship 🤡🤡🤡
that sponsor... fall from glory, cringing with babish
This guy fell off years ago (look at his view counts over time) so unsubbing for this is no real loss lol
Where did you find black pudding? I've been looking for it on the West Coast, but apparently US Customs has a ban on it.
Great video, Andrew! That's quite impressive.
Hey Andrew, I'm disgusted that you'd produce an ad for Hogwarts legacy. Goodbye forever
Unsubscribed. Yikes.
CRINGING WITH BABISH
Nice video
The Hogwarts sponsorship is really disappointing. I've been a fan of the channel since before that first Reddit AMA, but I can't continue to consume the content if this is what's being promoted.
used 2 love this channel but i cant believe they've willingly taken a sponsorship from a game and company that put their money directly towards horrible laws in an attempt to eradicate me and my friends from existence. very disappointing
will my comment be deleted for criticism
Hey, it's really disappointing you'd take a sponsorship from such a flagrantly antisemitic property - one openly made by a white supremacist, at that. To say nothing of JKRs own (who profits from the game, of course) rampant bigotry, transphobia, and racism. This isn't the kind of content I can support.
A bit disappointing to see a hogwarts legacy sponsership imo considering who the franchise is connected to (*cough*jkterfrowling*cough*)
man why are you taking sponsorships from a transphobic antisemitic shitshow cmon
I'd rather not have transphobia with my full English thanks. Unsubscribed.
Hogwarts Legacy 🤮🤢🤮 unsubscribed
Given the current controversy over HP and it's creator, I'm *supremely* disappointed in your choice to accept promotion for their new game. :(
Trans lives matter. No matter what they always will.
super disappointed you guys made this video, as a trans person I'm unsubscribing, you guys are better than this
Get out of here with that Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship...
Really disappointed that you've accepted the terf money, BCU.
Same people that complaining about the sponsorships are the same folks doxxing streamers and harassing others
foolish
Babish is still my go to channel for food pr0n  besides the bbq pit boys.... despite all these posturing from these people who seem to adapt the German nationalist socialist modus operandi from the 1930s to make it seem they are promoting an agenda insfead of their own egos.
sucks more than when Rookwood cursed Anne am I right my fellow harry potter fans?
Oh brother, I'm sure the comments on this one are absolutely lovely.  Anyway, trans people deserve respect, JK Rowling sucks, this game is mid, and I'm disappointed that Babish took this sponsorship.  But he's repeatedly shown multiple times that he is an ally, so I can't knock him too much, just kinda bummed.
I really wish you'd decided against doing this sponsorship. With the magnitude of your platform, I can scarcely imagine it's a make-or-break choice.
Very disappointed to see you taking a sponsorship from wizard game
the perfect sunday breakfast.
Ignore the people upset with you over a video game, not only were they never your fan in the first place, but they're too immature to understand fictional stories so they have to make up lies about it.
Never watched your channel but here to tell you you're a clown for sponsoring a Harry Potter game.
Way to say you don't care about trans people by taking a sponsorship for that game. I expected more from you
Wow I've lost all respect for you, buh bye
To all the denizens of Resetera and r/gamingcirclejerk. Stop it! Nobody likes you! Your asinine crusades led to actual cases of harassment, and to slam Babish for the sponsorship? For shame! If there's something that reinforces why people (including the ones you supposedly advocate for) hate you so much, it's stunts like this!
Years-long fan here, and I have to say it's disappointing that you'd associate yourself with this sponsor given JK's ongoing actions against the transgender community.
I thought you were an ally :/ Been subbed since 2016, sad to go man but I just can't support this.
No no wrong .
Sloppy workk
If Babbish gets cancelled, we riot!
People need to grow up. Happy you got your sponsor money which allows you to make more content, don't let the trolls get to you.
Watching this video purely for the sponsorship. ❤
Utterly disgusting to be taking money from such a sponsor. Just disappointing all around babish
Heard about this by watching Clownfish TV. I like cooking and hate bullies, So you got a new sub and I enjoyed the show. Thank you 😊
Y'all better be showing respect for trans and jewish individuals. I don’t have anything else to say. please be mindful and considerate.
Bummer that this is sponsored by the wizard game. Babish team, please read up on the antisemitism in the game and how the author sponsors anti-trans legislature. Love your work but I’m skipping this video.
Highly disappointed that your sponsorship is directly giving money to someone who is actively participating in a witch hunt against transgender people. I know you’ve done HP recipes in the past, but this one being sponsored during a time where the controversy (like anti-semitism, and trans issues as mentioned above) around this game has been talked about in mainstream media feels like you’re sending a message.   Correct me if I’m wrong, Andrew, but how else could this be seen? This is the last video of yours I’ll be watching.  EDIT: I didn’t actually watch this one. I saw the sponsorship at the beginning and went no further.
mann i thought you were cool. turns out youre just cringe. apparently you shilled for nfts too? lol on top of that you think its cool to take money from jkr after her rhetoric is being used to justify the mistreatment of trans people? and for all the fanboys trying to be his meat shield, you're also cringe :)
Amazing, 10/10 video
disappointing. bye babish
WE NEVER flip are eggs
nfts and now this? hope the transphobic blood money was worth it ig xx
Babish, I genuinely love your work and know you don't mean bad, but I'm seriously disappointed you chose to promote the wizard game - you've done a bad thing and you should know better
"Top comments" with fewer likes than some of the newest ones, and people say he's not suppressing comments...
Been watching you bro ever since the days of BOTW don't let these mentally ill terminally online weirdos that you down!  I'm always happy to check out your videos from time to time  Cheers man
Smart move to distract from the problematic sponsor by using bubble and squeak instead of hash browns
Normal people are on your side, Babish! Don’t let the bully activists win!
You sbould change the title to "Full English Bigot".
twitter freaks
Selling Out with Babish
Gotta love all the cis people attacking a person over a game about wizards, in my name and other trans folk's.
incredibly disappointed with BwB for accepting the sponsor for this video. You can't say you value diversity and equality with one side of your mouth and advertise a game made by bigots with the other side and keep the trust of the LGBTQ and Jewish communities.
Ignore all the ignorant bullies crying "bigot" at you, Babish. They're so lacking in self-awareness that they don't even realize that they're the ones bullying and being intolerant.
come on babish, not too late to delete this and stop promoting this antisemitic game made by transphobes.
I feel my cholesterol rising from here
Jeffree Star sponsorship next week, cant wait
why would you openly support someone who's infamous for transphobia and antisemitism?
This English Breakfast seems absolutely perfect after a whole night of drinking.
So sad that you support Hogwarts Legacy and JKR :(((
cringing with babish
It’s funny to see bunch of twitter freaks who never seen a video of babish attacking him 😂
been subscribed for a while but unsubbing for this ... not watching a channel sponsored by antisemitic transphobe money
Mate. No-one puts bubble and squeak on a full English. Also, that isn't bubble and squeak, bubble and squeak is leftovers. Hash browns are what we use for spuds.
dang, gotta say I'm bummed by the sponsorship you accepted for this one, but I understand the need to make money.  gotta unsubscribe over this one, but I've really enjoyed your past videos
You activist idiots realize you're turning normal people off of your cause through this misguided vitriol towards Babish.
Serf and Terf
yikes
hogwarts legacy….. yikes man
Such a disappointment that you're taking money from anti-semites and transphobes now. I'm a long-time fan and this is heart-breaking. I can't support this.
Super disappointed that you're promoting a game that actively benefit an antisemitic transphobe. I love your content, but as a transgender viewer I think i'm done for a while.
horrible to have to unsubscribe after years and years. it is a heartbreak that you would take this money from these people, and what's more, to suppress critical comments. horrible, disappointing behavior.
You’re taking money to promote transphobes now? This sucks man.
Really disappointed in you for taking this sponsorship. Will not be watching any future content.
Very disappointed to see you take money from fascists, hope it was worth it
Unsubscribed. I really liked your content. Never watching again though. JKR is getting trans people murdered and she needs to be starved of money and attention
Very disappointed you're advertising for this game when it's got antisemitism baked into it, not to mention the money going to JKR. I'm unfollowing for this, as much as I like your content.
this is the ultimate babish embarassment
Guess you don't care about your trans viewers anymore.
Sure is a big bummer about you doing a Hogwarts sponsorship. Been subscribed since your early videos but I'm out.
I agree. American breakfast sausage is no match for British bangers.
Shame on you for taking money from Hogwarts Legacy: the TERF behavior of its creator shouldn't be encouraged anymore.  At least consider donating some of the money you received to a transgender charity.  I'm disappointed in you, sir: I thought you better than this.
Really disappointed in the sponsorship choice for this episode. Long-time subscriber and I'm reconsidering.
welcome to Bigotry with Babish where this week, Andrew takes money from the antisemitic transphobic videogame and also promotes the product! unsubbed!
hate to have to unsub to a channel I've enjoyed this much for this long, but shilling for a Rowling property is a hard line. she's a virulent transphobe and antisemite. I truly hope you take the opportunity to look into this and decide whether that kind of hatred is what you'd like your channel to reflect.
So disappointed that Babish took that Terfy-Hogwarts money.
UNSUBBED! You have loyal trans and jewish viewers you are betraying!
Exyrenely disappointed in you Babish. Cant believe youre deleting comments as well. As a viewer for many years, Im sorry to say you have lost a loyal viewer and subscriber.
Were you aware this game is an antisemitism simulator when you took the sponsorship? It's about hunting down jewish stereotypes for blood libel. I kinda hoped you'd be better...
sponsored by terf game :/ bye
Can I get recommendations for any transgender and or Jewish cooking channels on youtube?
Man, I think the boycott of hogwarts legacy and the whole discussion surrounding it is pretty complicated and people should never be judged for not following the boycott, but being sponsored by the game is definitely questionable.
I've been watching this channel for, gosh, getting on towards a decade now. Never again. Choke on your fascist wizard money, Andrew.
You should have a look at the breakfast video from Hawksmoor in London. It's epic.
Pretty disappointed to see you hawking a game which will directly support a vocal transphobe with a huge audience.
:(
instant and permanent unsub for accepting the wizard pogrom game sponsorship.
not babish taking the terf money 😭
Hey, the Hogwart's Legacy sponsorship is a bad call. Won't be watching this one. If you somehow don't know, JKR is a huge TERF and giving her a platform is a truly evil thing to do.
Really? A hogwarts legacy ad? I thought you were better than this, babish. Unsubscribing. Don't support transphobia.
interesting sponsor....
Boo! Delete this comment, bet you won't
Disappointing
Fried bread looked decent, a true lynchpin of the full english
Sponsored by: Blood Libel and the Protocols of the Elders of Gringotts.
NFT shilling I could look past, but not promoting Blood Libel: The Game. Majorly disappointing to see you ignore the harm this game does to Jewish and trans people for the sake of a buck. Unsubscribed. It's a shame because I used to watch and enjoy your videos, but this is something I can't abide.
Do a Napoleon dynamite episode
No the antisemitic caricature videogame sponsor Babish I thought you better than this.
Very disappointed about this sponsor tbh. I hope the money was worth it, because idk if I can continue watching this channel and looking at the newer comments I'm not alone.
Disappointed as a long time fan. Dont support the fash.
Extremely disappointed in you shilling the blood libel wizard game funneling money to a fash. Hope the money you made was worth the trust of your fans, especially your trans & Jewish ones.
Man, they must've paid you trillions for you to be willing to tell all your (former) fans that you don't care about Trans or Jewish people!
How dare you put profits over trans lives (not to even mention all others affected by JKRs bigotry, and the fact the game was made by a known antisemite). I actually was rly interested in this recipe, but im not gonna watch it and am unsubbing now that i know youve partnered with HP.  Its 2023; start carin about trans lives.
Unfortunate to see the sponsorship. A shame to know this page is no longer safe for trans people
Disappointed in you Andrew
Unsubscribing because of the ad.  It's really scary times rn for a lot of people I love and JK Rowling is championing that harm done to them.  Is it that hard to have some humanity?
Trash sponsor.
cringing with babish
Hogwarts Legacy is antisemitic & J.K. Rowling said she uses her royalties for anti-trans lobbying. Why would you accept this sponsorship when it supports bigotry and hatred?
I give this 6/10 a few things missing and never use heinze, Branston are king
Really disappointed you're advertising for a game like HL.  I'm not going to watch the rest of this video.
unsubbing for this, bye
So you're transphobic now?
sad to see you taking terf money in the intro ad section
man, i really hope you're getting a *lot* of money from whatever contract you signed, because IDK how i'd go through with a hogwarts legacy sponsor nowadays. it better offset the loss of your trans and jewish viewerbase, along with everyone else with half a braincell
Binging with babish bigot moments
As a card holding Brit this is extremely accurate well done sir 👏
delete this comment i dont really care but there is intrinsic value in trans peoples lives, i wish to someday see a world where they arent in danger of being themselves. Thats all
this is really disappointing and sucks
There was a pub near me that opened for a few hours on a Saturday and Sunday morning just to serve a full English to the hungover villagers. Saturday morning about 50 people ate in almost complete silence, come back and drank most of the night Saturday, then be back eating a breakfast in complete silence on Sunday. It was an unwritten rule you only got the (admittedly excellent) breakfast for very cheap if you drank their the night before. Lead to a sureall secret club like the breakfast illuminati that basically decided every Major decision in the village and was the talk of local gossip for about 20 years
Not the hogwarts legacy ad 😕
1st version, nailed it. I once asked for this in a diner in new England and they looked at me like I had three heads. They were like 'that's a lot of food'. I was like 'well, it's breakfast!' Breakfast like a king lunch like prince dinner like a pauper
Bubble and Squeak is NOT a Full English Breakfast component - it's a lunch or dinner (tea|supper) staple.
Delicious, and I commend you for including fried bread and doing it right as well! But I don't know who told you bubble and squeak is an integral part of a English fry up! Also it should include vegetables e.g. cabbage, rather than just a lump of fried mash. However, bubble and squeak with a runny fried egg sitting on top is an absolute winner.
mypillow sponsor when?
Hey that sponsor is kinda really gross and really makes the channel look bad, like really reconsider the whole video
Babish... You've always been a great inspiration to me and a source of a lot of joy. I want to be a chef in great part because of you. As a trans person, it deeply hurts that you've accepted a sponsorship from Warner Brothers in light of the current controversy surrounding J.K. Rowling and the content of the game itself. I'm really urging you to do your research about the responses to the actions of the creators of Hogwarts Legacy from the Jewish and LGBTQ+ community. I want to believe that you genuinely did not know and that this was a simple mistake, it happens. Please, don't be blinded by nostalgia and ignore the cries of the people Rowling and this game are actively harming.
Aww no, not the TERF game 🤢
as a trans fan i'm very disappointed to see babish advertising hogwarts legacy and putting money in the TERF queens pockets
Babish, please please don't do ads for Hogwarts Legacy
fig dies and rookwood cursed anne
I appreciate the video but you compared American "breakfast sausage" to bangers. The "breakfast sausage" you had was cheap $1 frozen mini boxes of sausage and the bangers were from a butcher/sausage maker. At least have the ingredients be equal.
We don't do bubble and squeak on a full English we have hash browns. Also, NEVER flip your eggs, we don't do that 😂
Jewish and Trans, and I'm clicking that bell to unsubscribe Get better advertisers
Maybe don’t take money from bigots?
I'm actively not watching this because of the sponsor just so you know
Yeah gotta be hash browns
aw, Andrew, come on :( i’m trans and i’ve always found your videos inspiring. i got your cookbook for christmas! and now you’re advertising the Blood Libel And Transphobia game? genuinely heartbreaking.
This sucks. Sorry but unsubscribing.
Bubble and squeak is best when the ingredients were cooked the day before and chilled 👍
this is a trans hug for the ppl who are sad and confused abt the harry potter sponsorship
I have unsubscribed because of your Hogwarts Legacy ad read. The game is antisemitic and the IP holder is the single most influential transphobe in the world. You ought to have done more research
After I enjoyed the breakfast Babish from the Phantom Thread episode, it's been my hope Babish would do a full English for a while. It really hurt to see who the sponsor was, but I tried to power through and just try to enjoy the episode itself. But I couldn't, especially that second tag in the middle, though, I couldn't keep going and now I'm just sad and hurt and I think I'm going to unsubscribe, at least for a while. Maybe I'm being too sensitive, but it's also the case that laws are being passed across the country banning trans people from public life and taking trans children away from their parents and the lawmakers passing those laws are, in part, citing Ms. Rowling, who consistently points to the social and financial success of Harry Potter as proof that her beliefs are supported by most people. I'm sure a bunch of folks will be rude about this comment, but I've so liked this chanel for so long, and was so excited when it reached 10 million, that I wanted to say something before I unsubscribed. I'm sorry.
Yrs ago we had fried spud aswell
Yeah, an add read for a JK Rowling IP in the midst of her using the brands success as a green light to attack transgender people and the rest of the LGBT community is where I draw line. Enjoy the bump in engagement and the TERF video game money but this where I unsubscribe
Least brown British meal
Absolutely disappointed by your choice of sponsor. Will not watch this video and will unsubscribe if it happens again.
I feel like whenever Babish does classic meals from other countries he deliberately gets a couple of things wrong because he knows the inevitable Botched follow up episode will get a ton of views
Sorry to see that you're promoting the anti-semetic terf game. I'm not going to tell you where and how you should make money, I know you must be really short of it and desperate for any sponsorship you can get, but this one might just have cost you more subscribers than it makes you
Upsetting to see babish fall in with Hogwarts Legacy. You didn't need to do this, Babish.
Really disappointed you're running ads for Hogwart's legacy.
this sponsorship sucks to see as a trans person and as someone with Jewish loved ones. I get that JK wasn't as involved with this project, but... still sucks to see. I was excited for this episode but couldn't make it thru the ad read.
You thought you had problems with the Italians? Oh dear...
Sorry but I can't support a channel supporting JK Rowling products. She is a powerful and influential TERF who has said she sees any support of products related to her as an explicit support of her transphobic views.
I know money is money but this sponsorship is just embarrassing and disappointing.
Do the full Irish breakfast next plz!!
Heartbreaking to have to unsubscribe. So disappointed in you for this sponsorship. I guess your Jewish and trans followers mean nothing to you.
seeing babish promote hogwarts legacy makes me kind of sad as a trans person honestly. i really hope his beliefs dont align with jk rowling's :(
Disappointing and disgusting, not only are you supporting violence against trans people, but you've elected to promote Antisemitism: The Game. Unsubbed and blocked immediately.
When's your Chick-fil-A sponsorship to round out the bigotry backers?
Disappointed. Unsubed
I'm impressed. By getting everyone to focus on his inclusion of bubble & squeak, as well as his misattribution of "Canadian bacon" to ham while actually using back bacon earlier in the video, Babish has COMPLETELY avoided any and all controversial comments regarding his acceptance of a Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship.  Outstanding move, Mr. Rea.
Disappointed you'd take a Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship - yikes
Disappointed
I’m really disappointed to see this sponsor. I’ve been subscribed for years and have learnt most of my cooking skills from this channel so it’s extra heartbreaking to see the BCU promote this.
Well. I didn't think you'd support the bigotry of Rowling, I'm was hoping I can continue to support you. That's disappointing.
cringing with babish
Would just like to say that I'm unsubscribing due to the Hogwart's Legacy sponsorship. I'm not here to tell you how you should conduct your business, but I am choosing to no longer support it for personal reasons.
I really hoped I wouldn't see this on your channel, Andrew. The game that sponsored this video funds an actual neonazi who associates with people who call for those like me to be systematically wiped off the face of the earth. An apology would be a start, but I'm astounded you chose this in the first place. My safety should not be outweighed by other people's nostalgia for a poorly written book series.
I fully support Babish and Hogwarts Legacy, and so should you. I am speaking truth to power.
eeeew promoting the antisemitic game?
Gotta be a Scottish Breakfast next.
Dont accept ad rev from people who are pro-genocide thanks
I hate to be that person but I've been disappointed by the sponsors that Babish and his team have worked with.
Can't say I'm surprised, but it is still disappointing to see you taking that sponsor.
As an English person I'm delighted to see this gastronomic treat.  I'm not at all happy to see the video sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy though. I don't think everyone has to care about the things I do, but I'm almost certain that Andrew and the team don't agree with the opinions of Rowling, so it's unfortunate they have taken money to promote a product that benefits her and raises her profile.
Accepting a sponsorship from a game that supports and spreads transphobia and antisemitism on such a deep, intrinsic level is utterly unacceptable. That's an instant unsubscription from me.
Andy... that sponsor... so sad man. so sad. unfortunately it definitely changes how I view you and the channel.
The sponsor spot with WB Hogwarts Legacy is absolutely disappointing.
I'm disappointed to see you advertising a game that enriches a person who uses their money on trans oppression
Absolutely disappointed by the sponsor. Do better.
Between the bubble and squeak, and the bad sponsor, I'mma say this episode needs a rework.
fried bread has to be deep friend my man
You love to see the pro-bigotry crowd losing their minds over the sheer volume of "I'm very disappointed in you Sensei" posts from based allies. "B-b-but muh silent majority!?"
Seeing the sponsor was absurdly disappointing, I unsubscribed after 5 years, shame on you.
I'm really disappointed you're promoting Hogwarts Legacy. It's not like it's hard to find information about JKR's transphobia or the antisemetic themes of the game itself online
Long time follower. Yikes on today’s partnership, my dude.
disappointed that you would take that sponsorship guys.
ok, ok, ok, ok, quinoa oil? ok, ok, ok, quinoa oil?, ok, ok, AND tomatoes, ok, ok.
It's disappointing to see this and in extremely bad taste. As a large content creator you need to hold yourseld accountable. The antisemitism in the new Harry Potter game is well known. It was well established in the series and was used as a scapegoat.  This has been brought up again even more recently with the game. There is no way you didn't know this. Do better.
I am absolutely disgusted that you accepted this sponsorship. I've been subscribed for years and enjoyed your content, but will be unsubscribing now. There is no excuse for supporting the antisemitic and transphobic material both within and surrounding the 'wizarding world'
Can you taste the antisemitism in this dish or is that just in the game that sponsored the video
Rip, been a fan for a while but had to unsubscribe because you financially supported such bigoted nonsense. Babish bigot embarrassment 2023
You should try Irish sausage, it’s the best thing ever 😁 and we don’t typically call them “bangers” 😅
I was gonna buy your cookbook for my trans partner when it comes out in October but I don’t think I will. Enjoy the money
You can get rid of the bubble and squeak and the vine tomatoes. Sheesh.
Wow, just.... absolutely disappointed that you would accept a sponsorship from such an Anti-Trans and Anti-Semetic game.
really disappointed in you for promoting that video game. it's really antisemitic, and any money that lines JKR's pockets is put towards furthering her anti-trans agenda in lobbying for more discriminatory legislation.
This is so disappointing babish, as a long time supporter of your channel this hurts in a way you wouldn’t ever understand
The twitter and tumblr activist are upset.
wow what a fun game
Unsubscribed, deeply disappointed in your choice of sponsor. Enjoy your blood money.
Genuinely disappointed in you for accepting this sponsor, dude. Not cool.
Can you purchase blood sausage in the US?
As a trans person and someone who's admittedly against anti-Semitism this is incredibly disappointing. Giving a sponsor to that game when you claim to be an "ally" is truly disrespectful. Never unsubbed so fast.
Whoo boy, the twitter crazies are gonna have a conniption when they see the sponsor.
FRIED BREAD!  YOU BEAUTY!  Now THIS.  THIS is a real Full English Breakfast.  THANK YOU.
Bubble and squeak??
What new horror is this! Bubble and squeak being touted as a Full English...Fried bread made with butter...
Don’t put bubble and squeak on a full English, that’s nonce behaviour. Use hash browns
Personally, I have never seen fried bread made with pre-buttered bread. We fry that bread in whatever oil and juices are left over from frying everything else. You get a slice of absolute flavour/oil which is perfect for the english breakfast. Also your bubble and squeak would ideally have it's other components be chunkier.
Yikes...
Andrew I'm disappointed with the sponsor.
Don't worry about the diss-ers Andrew, they'd have no concerns if you had the developers of Atomic Heart sponsor a video.
We don't have "eggs over easy" in England, we just have fried eggs...
Reckon you should do the full Scottish next, it's clearly superior to the full English!
Only had bubble in a cafe Full English, only had vine tomatoes in a hipster restaurant Full English, and what kind of "bangers" are we talking about here? Cumberlands? Lincolnshires? Plain pork sausage? Looks tasty, however. Disappointing choice of sponsor, must say as well.
Make the food from "Day in the Life of a True Brexit Geezer" next?
I think that eating meat in the bigining of a day  is fatiguing for stomach
Way to bring politics into your videos with the sponsorship...
You should always try to use a savoy cabbage and not a white one, bread should always be cooked in lard or dripping and your black pudding looked awful.
I was really disappointed to see that this video was sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy. The game itself utilizes antisemitic tropes, and J.K. Rowling has contributed more to the rise of transphobia in the U.K. than probably any other individual person.
I'm disappointed you allowed this sponsorship. Please don't support transphobia and antisemitism
Professor Fig dies regardless of your choices
Full English breakfast + butterbeer = Harry Potter Marathon 🙏☺️
Very upset you support and accept money from an anti semitic and transphobic company and j k Rowling herself
I would have liked to watch this but oh well.....
Absolutely disappointing you felt the need to take blood money for this episode.
hoping this comments section brings to light the kinds of people that will staunchly defend the sponsor of this video.
tfs Bubble and Squeak and you didnt eat it hungover
He is missing the most important item. Cup of tea.
Shame. I liked you.
I hadn't known you supported the politics of that game.
I can't subscribe to someone who doesn't think enough about who they have as a sponsor.
should give an Irish breakfast a go similar to English but no mushrooms or tomatoes. add potato cake/farl or boxty and has white pudding (cross between sausage and black pudding)
Angry because , I paid for youtube premium AD FREE , and yet you somehow worked in an AD ! Hope it’s an anomaly and not the start of a trend . Blocked !
Enjoy the TERF money
Pretty bummed to see Babish advertising for the transphobic, antisemitic Hogwarts game. :(
I'm missing two things on this plate: ketchup and brown sauce.
Bubble and squeak? Over easy? And you call that black pudding?  I'm just kidding. Your Americanised full English looks delicious.
Very disappointed on you accepting this game as an sponsor.
You should try an Irish breakfast, way better and comes with a pint of Guinness.
Anyone who is complaining about the sponsor is either A) not going to stop watching BWB content Or B) has not watched this content before and is only her to continue their crusade against the sponsor. Look at the top comments. It's all about the food. Go spread your political takes on a political channel
Pretty disappointed at that sponsor.
Everyday?
Bad sponsor 😕
only babish could make British food look appetizing
your sponsor dude....yikes....more like cringing with babish
I'd say the hash browns are a lot more common with a full english over here than bubble and squeak. The latter is mainly had as a separate breakfast by using leftovers from a sunday roast and cracking an egg on top.
Extremely disappointing sponsorship, dude. Read the room. Feels like throwing your trans and Jewish viewers under the bus for cash.
Making hash browns as an "American" version of the British breakfast would be like making a cup of tea as an American alternative to Gatorade!
Babish: puts bubble and squeak on a Full English breakfast Everyone in Britain: *so you have chosen death*
Dude.  Taking money from the terf for blood libel: the game?  Not cool.
shame ya gotta support the terf and antisemitic lady just for an english breakfast
$800 million in 14 days :)
Love when Babish does ads for bigots.
There's still a debate in my house over what tomato to use. I prefer frying fresh ones but my mum prefers just heating up a tin of chopped instead.
I’m still in awe at the fact people really fry the egg just to leave the yolk raw.
Yeah the British shelf of a foreign supermarket is always a pretty harsh look in the mirror for us.
oh boy this comment section is going to be absolute AIDS.  also, you have hash browns with a Full English, not Bubble and Squeak.
Really disappointed by your sponsor today. I hope all the comments I see about people's disappointment and my own makes an impression on you to choose your sponsors more wisely.
Please try and re-create scooby snacks🙏🏻🙏🏻
content creators don't advertise the game with the creator who promotes genocide challenge (Impossible)
Cool to see you doing a take on an English breakfast, honestly pretty disappointing seeing the sponsor behind it... The comments section being torn between Brits and American's debating bubble and squeak is priceless though
not the blood libel wizard game sponsership...
You forgot the HP Sauce.
Should do a Scottish one next with square sausage and potato scones
dude. really? unsubscribing for the sponsor
“A hopefully authentic Full English”  “Let’s start with bubble and squeak”  Every British person just shook their heads woefully.
Bubble and squeak 😂 man fell at the first hurdle
We don't flip our eggs we based them with oil until cooked, we don't have bubble and squeak for breakfast, sausages are better cooked in the oven
I heavily suggest you reconsider being sponsored by this game, since money from it goes to JK Rowling herself and you all know the deal with her.
Wow really disappointed to see you taking add deals from someone so violently and visibly hateful. Long time fan but that is an instant unsubscribe to me, I really thought you were a better person than that
I've come for the comments.
pirate the wizard game please <3  support trans peeps and don't give funds to jkr I will give suggestions for other games to buy if you wanna and dw the plot of the game is not even new not spoiling but it's just the hp story but bad , you are not missing out . <3
Wow this looks absolutely disgusting. British food has to be the worst cuisine (great video though, Andrew)
Full Irish mate
ooo theyre going to try to cancel you now
So disappointed you decided to take this sponsorship.
Actually legendary Babish. This is the most authentic English breakfast I've ever seen from an American.  Ironically you're missing the most obvious part which is a cup of tea to wash down all the grease. Appreciate the effort of research that has gone into this
Not gonna write a whole essay but just wanna say I’m surprised and disappointed to see this channel supporting a product that directly funds J.K. Rowling.
Hogwarts Legacy, most financially successful game of the year. Great to see it!
Better than the show
Majorly disappointed right now, I will be unsubscribing.  Thanks for showing your true colours I guess.
Oh dear. My heart sank when I heard a yank was doing this.. very risky...
you should have gone with a full Irish Breakfast
Just here for the bubble & squeak comments 😅
Bubble & Squeak is not part of the Full English, it’s a dish on its own with the leftover veggies.
Black pudding is part of a scottish breakfast, not full English. It's also not actually sausage (at least not a meat), it's only oatmeal and blood. It's basically white pudding but with blood
Really disappointed in you for taking this sponsorship babish
Disappointed by your choice of sponsor.
well that's disappointing
Bubble and Squeak is a leftover meal, hash browns are what's usually used.   Sometimes we use whole portobello mushrooms instead of small chopped ones.   It's also required to be hungover when eating this.
babish im so disappointed you would accept a sponsor from a game that has a plot entirely based on an antisemetic blood libel story that actively enables the hatemouth that is joanne to have a platform entirely on transphobia and antisemitism.
This sponsor is really disappointing for you to do, man.. really sad..
White CIS people pretending they're helping trans people by embarrassing them.
😬
I’m incredibly disappointed right now. I absolutely loved your videos but now you’ve accepted and associated yourself with a franchise who actively pays and supports someone who is actively encouraging the harm of the trans community, I can no longer support you.  I know I’m only one person, so yes it won’t make much difference, but I can still stand by human values.
Harry P*tter? :/
very sad to see you supporting this game. thought you were better than that. disappointing.
hmmmm can really taste the blatant antisemitism in every bite
holy thats a lot of dislikes
not the sponsership from the wildly antisemitic game that's helping to fund trans genocide in the uk 💀💀
i just want to try it once in my life, blood sausage and all. the closest we can get around here is just a sad imitation with none of the stuff i want the most
Have you considered not supporting the media empire of a virulent transphobe by being sponsored by Antisemitism The Game?
if the first spell u use isn't avada kadavra ur a wimp and u don't know what comedy is 🤣🤣
As a longtime viewer and enjoyer of your content Andrew, I know I’m not alone when I say I’m disappointed. I know big YouTubers often accept any big sponsorship deal that comes their way, since turning one down would be giving up a very lucrative opportunity. But you have to draw the line somewhere. I’m sorry to say but this episode will affect my opinion of you for a long time to come.
could americans please do more than 2 minutes of research before trying to make a full english? this is just a bit embarrassing to be honest
There is this myth that all us brits call sausages "bangers". I can assure you, unless its followed by the words "and mash" its just sausages... They're only called bangers somewhat ironically.
Why so many dislikes?
Man the brigade of insane people is just crazy. Btw if you see goblins as Jews you're the racist.
Unsubbing after six years, disappointed in you man.
hahaha at all the triggered activists disliking because Muh HaRrY PoTTeR!
Do you play Hogwarts legacy?
Living cost is expensive nowadays, living costs in new York has ALWAYS been expensive, Babish has bills to pay and mouths to feed, a sponsorship this big isn't too crazy
England is truly the only nation that conquered 20% of the world for spices, just to then not use any of them in their kitchen.
Disappointed you accepted this sponsor.
wish you hadnt accepted this sponsorship. jk rowling is a hateful person, who actively despises trans and jewish people.
I love Hogwarts and babish
this was a very easy unsub
You really had to take money from the bigot wizard game, didn't you?
I really wish this wasn't sponsored by that game. I love your work Babish, but as a trans-woman, seeing you endorsing - and therefore encouraging others to buy and interact with - media that helps give money and a platform to a woman who actively encourages people to despise me and other trans people is really demoralising:/ I really hope you do something about this
Botched.
hey, it really sucks that you took this sponsor. it's disappointing seeing someone support jk rowling like that when it's well documented how bigoted she is. idk what else to say, I'm just really disappointed man
UH OH BABISH IS A TRANSPHOBE GUYS
long time jewish and trans fan here. babish, to say i'm disappointed and sad is an understatement. your content has brought me a lot of joy over the years and to see you endorse a game with an antisemitic plot like this which directly benefits someone advocating for the destruction of trans people is painful. i'm unsubbing after 6 years.
Truly sad to see you working with Harry potter after all the horrible things Rowling has said. Truly expected better from you Andrew 😡
Sponsored by transphobia, disappointing.
babby... why did you take a sponsor from the wicked witch babby... she's gonna curse you...
=<
why so many dislikes?
I’m a little disappointed in you for taking this sponsor I would have assumed you cared about trans or Jewish people enough to turn down a sponsor
man. i know you've gotta get paid but taking this sponsor is disappointing.
don't take money to promote the bigot's game, c'mon.
I love both of these, with bangers (as you say) being the better, but with hash browns over B&S. However, I'd ditch the mushrooms for some wilted English spinach under the tomatoes.
who cares about trans people or jews when you can get that juicy sponsor money amiright? this is disappointing and honestly embarassing
that's disappointing.
so i didnt read every comment but whats with the ratio on this video? its at 16k like to 5.9k dislike for those who cant see it.
Lol @ all the trans people crying genocide over the sponsor. Dying by the millions, you sure are.
A little disappointed to see Babish accepting a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy
i love this video idea
This brought back so many memories for me. My Grandmother used to make this breakfast for me on weekends when I used to stay with her. I'm going to cry.
I know your probably don't have massive control over your sponsors, but seeing this one made me sad. The publisher and IP holder for that game are very transphobic, and many people are glossing over the fact that the IP holder has said that all royalties are going to anti-trans hate groups.
Not really American when you said Canadian more than anything.
Make steamed hams from the Simpsons!
Disappointed to see you help promote the TERF's game
The sponsorship was a jump scare
Great sponsor babish
disappointed to find babish accepting a sponsorship from a transmisogynist author of an antisemitic game.
It's possible that absolutely no one on your team was aware of JK's views, but I refuse to believe that. Surely someone at least googles your sponsors. There should be no amount of money you're willing to take in exchange for throwing trans and Jewish people under the bus. If anyone on your team was aware of this and you still took the offer that is just deliberately cruel. If funds are so tight then make a video about how you refuse to take the terf money and drop us your paypal. Disappointing and thoughtless. I want nothing more than to find out that this was a genuine mistake.
Super, super disappointed to see you working with and promoting a game whose coffers actively funds a powerful transphobe, and who uses said money to push transphobic agendas and harm trans people everywhere. Outside of the transphobia, the game is also extremely, EXTREMELY anti-semitic. I thought you were a kinder person than this.
Babish it would be great to hear your stance on support of LGBTQ+ after taking this sponsorship. Will the sponsorship money and revenue go to charities supporting the community?  I'd hope to not see this sponsor.  For any saying let people have fun or which ever; it's the principle of support. Ala chick fil a. People saying and not doing is lack luster support. Even if the writer doesn't make money off the game, it's the connection and meaning of what this represents/connects to her  I don't know if the comments have been removed or just very few of this audience are within or allies of the LGBTQ+ community, but it's shocking how little there is speaking out on this sponsor. Hoping this will spread the word
I think its time to make the Perfect Egg Bite from Joe Pera Talks With You
I was disappointed to see this sponsorship as well. I'm sure dozens of others have stated why, I'm just adding my voice. Going to be unsubscribing for the foreseeable future.
Please don't peel your potatoes for bubble and squeak, it's a leftovers dish, don't make life harder for yourself. Just jam it all together! It tastes great.
Super disappointed you're promoting the hogwarts game dude. You can't pretend you don't know about the transphobia, anti-semetic story, and racism
Oh hey, real cool that you're sponsored by bigotry babish.
Adding my dissapointment to the pile. This was so sad to hear.
Where can i get black pudding (aka blood pudding) on the east coast USA?
sponsored by hogwarts legacy? really?
Losers trying to struggle session babish
Dont tell me you’ve fallen asleep or something 🥺 reply with something bigoted and offensive if ur still here
Aw I’m not seeing my favorite hate spammers anymore :( If you’re still there I miss u, come back
I have it! I pre-ordered Hogwarts Legacy! OML my life is complete, Babish sponsored by Harry Potter (y'know what I mean) *SQUEALS* Soooooo gotta try making full English -sans blood sausage cuz I'm not THAT much a Bellatrix- this weekend <3<3<3<3<3<3
It hurts to hear sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy. I don't need the lecture about why you personally don't think it's a big deal, but as a trans person myself, it hurts to see support for that game. I just.... why?
Oh we're selling out to terfs now, huh? Wish I could say I expected better of Bought-out Babish
Coping going on in comments :)
If you want to go for the Scottish version. Add a Lorne sausage (also known as a slice or square sausage), haggis and swap the hash browns for a potato (tattie) scone. If you can get it Stornoway Black pudding is best you can get.
We pray that you don’t get sponsored by the Harry Potter game again, much love
how are there no comments about how utterly disappointing it is to see you taking money to promote a game that profits a violent transphobe.
twitter users coping in the comments
Hey can you make the “primoburg” from Pizza Tower the game?
Lost me with that sponsor. Bye
You have enough of a subscriber base to thoughtfully choose a sponsor and your team chose Hogwarts Legacy? Please fix your vetting process and be wiser in accepting sponsorships.
Promoting JK Rowling rn is extremely tone deaf..
Time to unsubscribe
For your American version you should have added goetta, scrapple, or livermush. They're all somewhat similar, and basically the closest thing to black pudding that is commonly available in the US.
Genuinely sucks to see you endorse a game that's putting money directly into the hands of a bigot who's using her wealth and influence to change legislation and making it harder for trans people to exist. Please reconsider.
Pro tip: set your comments to newest and witness the twitter users go insane about a sponsorship he was likely paid thousands to do.
Due to this episode's sponsor, I'm now unsubscribing from the channel.
it makes me sad you would support this sponsorship, please don't buy this game it is inherently homophobic and transphobic sad to see you go down this route :(
This episode is sponsored by transphobia and antisemitism.
reckon hashbrowns are more common than the bubble and squeak, that's usually just had as leftovers the day after. just needs a tea and you're grand
First NFTs, now this? Why do you have to bring politics into cooking? Can't we just enjoy making food?
babish ignore these fake activists dislike bombing your video because of a game sponsership they are confused brainwashed children and think harassing over somthing they know nothing about is justice
Sad to see you promote this game in literally AND way. Loved your channel for years, bought from the Banish store, but I can't look past this.   Please research and make a statement
Very disappointing to see this sponsorship
Oh so we're supporting the blood libel antisemitism game now? Yikes.
Dang it Bab, why'd you have to go and take that dirty wizard money, you know where it's been. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.
Am disappointed you accepted a sponsorship for the new Hogwarts game!  Unfortunately I cannot support you any longer.
The snobbery, the pretentiousness, the diet culture, the arrogance, the crypto nonsense. But it took the antisemitism and transphobia for me to unsubscribe. More disappointed in myself, really.
I understand that not everyone is online enough to know the ramifications of accepting such a sponsorship, but i have to say I'm disappointed that you would accept money to sponsor a group so closely associated with active hate campaigns
JK Rowling was right.
Extremely disappointed that you would take money from a studio with proven neonazis at the core, making a game about antisemitism, in a world run by a terf. Be better.
massive cope in this comment section
I'm really disappointed to see you accept this sponsorship Andrew. The game in question is harmful to the trans and Jewish communities. JKR directly benefits from game sales and the game is built directly on the antisemitism of the books.
Babish your going to trigger all the geezers on here, the fry up police have been called.
I am disappointed in the accepted sponsor of this video.
bubble and squeak isn't a breakfast food...
This is extremely misleading. I don't see Phyrexian Dreadnaughts anywhere.
Pro Chef here. Watched your videos, and most are spot on! I'm Japanese and French trained. And you could use some help on your asian cookery. Love your cooking and you keep it real! Keep up the work!
You've lost my respect. Thank you for what you have taught me, but with this video's sponsor, you can no longer be trusted with the hope of keeping my friends and family safe. I hope you learn why we are reacting like this, and I look forward to being able to enjoy your work again.
Come on folks, he's not advertising the dumb TERF. This game is a Warner Brothers Product, they signed this contract way back in the 90's, before Twitter even EXISTED. Please think about how this hurts game CodeMonkeys, and save your rage for stuff the evil cow is DIRECTLY involved in.
"This video is sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy"  Uh oh. Uh oh. *UH OH.*
Unsubbed. Very disappointed in your choice of sponsor.
absolutely DISGRACEFUL to take a sponsorship from the antisemitic and transphobic game. you should be ASHAMED of yourself
cringe sponsoring TERF game
Sponsored by hogwarts legacy?  You don't need money that bad. Really disappointed to see you supporting antisemitism and transphobia. Consider me no longer a fan
It's very disappointing that you've taken a sponsorship about Hogwarts Legacy. I get making money is important, but I'd have thought that creating a safe space for trans people and jewish people would be more important.
Hey, super upset that in this great time of trans people being attacked in press, legislation, by Rowling herself, and when our lives are on the line, you’d take money and spend your time promoting this game. Maybe I’m taking this too personally, sure, but even little acts of solidarity can go a long way. ❤
Gonna get a pile on for this but it’s really disappointing that you’ve partnered with WB Games and are promoting Hogwarts Legacy. You have to know the controversy surrounding who this game is directly funding and the damage she is doing to the trans community, especially in the UK. If you and the crew consider yourself allies to the LGBT community, please, please reconsider this sponsorship.
ovular does not mean oval shaped, unless you were trying for a egg pun
Disappointing to see you sponsoring and promoting anti-semitism and transphobia through the WB partnership. Do better Babish
utterly disapointed, i though of you as a concious content creator. unsuscribed
Why are people upset? Money he’s pocketing is money JK Rowling can’t use to further her agenda. Everyone who wanted the game already bought the game already thanks to all the free advertisement it received. Doubt an ad this late will do anything.
Pretty dodgy taking a sponsorship for hogwarts legacy when JK Rowling is a TERF who actively said she was going to use her royalties from the game to donate money to anti-trans groups. Super disappointing. Hope this means babish just isn't aware of the situation somehow?
Why he peel like that
please do not address the negative comments just move on please
Canadian can still be American because the county is also on the North American contenent so it still works.
pretty disappointing that you'd support this game, especially with how much hate & transphobic bigotry the franchise author blatantly spouts
This sponsorship is disgusting. I expected better from you. Rethink your life and priorities.
Antisemitic Terf Game as the sponsor?  Lame.  The actual food? Delicious!
Everyone's complaining about the bubble and squeek but did you consider that Andrew is being the change he wants to see in the English Breakfast world?
NOOOO BABISH NOT THE TRANSPHOBIA ANTISEMITISM SPONSOR NOOOO
why would you make this
I hope the money was worth the transphobia and antisemitism. I really love this channel I hope you realize the error of your ways and make amends.  Extremely disappointing
comment section smells like discord
Sorry Babs but gonna unsub for this one.  Actively taking a sponsorship for a product that's tied to the richest bigot just is a line crossed here.
Babish, you can turn down sponsors. You didn't have to promote a game that's being boycotted for being antisemitic and supports transphobic people. Boo.
Alright you know what. I'm not gonna say anything. You know what you did.
The English people really mad asf over this breakfast lol, this is about the only meal they have that doesn't look like the Germans are still bombing London
No wonder it's also called a fry up.
Disappointed to see the BCU do a sponsorship from something that is connected to JKR
Disappointed and unsubscribed. Can’t believe you’d accept support from someone who literally wants me and my friends dead.
Really disappointed in the ad for the game funding transphobic politics in the UK!
You should never use canola oil,it’s really bad for you.
disappointing sponsor ngl
Can i just say how absolutely maddeningly difficult it is to try and find ANYWHERE locally to buy blood to make black pudding and the like?
So the American counterpart is not what I would’ve choose but ok. Our breakfast is fried eggs,bacon,sausage,fried potatoes and biscuits and gravy. The gravy would be white sausage gravy cooked old school and proper like. If you don’t have time for sausage gravy then toast would do in a pinch. This is one of the few times I wouldn’t eat either.
babish embarrassment to end them all
No.
very conflicted, wanna upvote for Hogwarts but I just don't know if I can condone British food.
What a delicious meal! I think i'll now go purchase that blood libel game that lets you commit literal pogroms against jews! They even let avada kedavara trans people, if you can believe it! So glad Satan Himself could make this videogame possible!
All of your Trans subscribers are your enemies now.
unsubscribing and not watching your videos anymore. extremely disappointed that you took this sponsorship instead of showing any degree of support or solidarity with trans people or jewish people. anyone with a brain can see how jk rowling and the harry potter franchise has become a symbol of transphobia and antisemitism, and you actively decided to support that.
Bro why you pushing the TERF game?
Super disappointed that you took this sponsor. I expected better.
Cringing with Babish
not watching this video because it’s extremely disappointing that the BCU is taking money from harry potter. might genuinely stop watching because of this. this is really upsetting.
based babish. british breakfast ain't it tho
Aw, dude.  Why would you take money from these people? :/
Now unsubscribing. Please reconsider taking TERF money. I thought better of you. I know you need to make money to survive. But there are other sponsors that are much less harmful to society.
man hogwarts legacy is full of antisemetism and transphobia and supports a very racist and hateful person and you accepting a sponorship from them is very disapointing babish
Get it that you have to make a living, but a bit disappointed with the Hogwarts ad.
I’m really disappointed that babish took this sponsorship
Unsubscribed.
nahhh miss me with this unsubbed
Ham steak is what the American version should have used. Babish, how did you mess up your own culture? It's like you've never even been to a Dennys.
Hey just a reminder that JK Rowling is transphobic and by downloading hogwarts legacy you are actively hurting trans people
babish antisemitism embarrassment
People are really tryna cancel him for the sponsor.   Yall need to get off the internet and touch grass. There are way bigger issues in the world than this garbage
Stopped at "Hogwarts Legacy" - gross dude.
Deep fried chocolate cheeseburger rolled in rock candy. Make it.
pretty cringe fail taking a sponsorship for the antisemitic blood libel game that supports someone actively fighting to make the lives of trans people worse.
Dude, Andrew....really?  Hogwarts Legacy?  That's gross.  You're better than that.
the real ones remember "binging with babish"
It is heartbreaking that after years of watching this channel I had to unsubscribe today. I cannot support a creator who supports such a transphobic game. There is no excuse, this is telling me, and all other trans fans, that you care more about a paycheck then you do trans people.
Looks like we have met tiny whisk's distant cousin, tiny spatula.
Andrew and team, as I hope you're aware the game you're promoting is incredibly antisemitic, and JKR is violently transphobic. I'm beyond disappointed to see this on your channel, and I am now unsubscribing after being a fan and subscriber for many many years. Please consider issuing an apology and taking this video down.
Imagine being sponsors by an antisemetic game giving money to a Transphobe I’m disappointed with you
Absolutely infuriating to see this channel support a transphobe
Delete this, man. You're practically supporting a Transphobe with it....
Bigotry with Babish
As a trans person, it's very upsetting for me to see the Babish culinary universe taking money from known TERF and all around hateful person JK Rowling. I will be unsubscribing because of the support you have shown to her and her transphobic, anti-Semitic game.
you are one of the most popular cooking youtubers on the platform and you could've had a moral backbone and said "no" to a deal that promotes hogwarts legacy, seeing as you could make ad revenue many other ways, but i suppose its too much to ask someone not to support antisemitism and transphobia so they can make a few extra dollars. as a trans person, i am beyond disappointed in you. hope it was worth it to alienate marginalised the people in your audience.
could've just omitted the salt in your recipes and used this comment section instead subbed :^)
I hope whatever paycheck Warner wrote was worth advertising that antisemetic mess of a video game
I've been a big fan of yours for years, so I can't express enough the disapointment I felt seeing an ad for Hogwarts Legacy at the beginning of this video. This game lines a transphobe's pockets, a transphobe who we know funds anti trans organizations and uses her money and influence to help push through anti-trans legislation. This game is also extremely antisemitic and racist. After years of watching every video I now need to unsubscribe, I'm so disappointed that you are not the ally I thought you were.
Lol, I don’t think Hogwarts Legacy needs the sponsorship position .
Best video yet Babish, you have reached new heights 👏
im disappointed that you would choose to work with a game based on so much hate, anti semitism and transphobia. jk rowling has made enough money off of her hatred, she doesn't need another video game to add to her billions.
disappointed to see the sponsor of this one... hard pass :(
Struggling to find the words to express how angry I was to find out about this sponsorship. Accepting sponsorship from a game/franchise marred by transphobia and antisemitism is a horrible look and you should be ashamed.
See ya in the funny papers, Babish.
While I do love a Full English, I prefer the Full Scottish. Basically the same but haggis instead of blood sausage. VERY tasty
Unsubscribing. Wild that your entire team did the calculus and decided "Hawk the TERF game" was the right course of action.
I absolutely love your channel and have binged so many episodes, but you hurt my heart within the first ten seconds of this one… I know sponsors are hard to come by and the channel has to be funded, but I hope you take the time to evaluate why this specific sponsor is problematic.
Great vid Babish
Disappointed by the sponsorship, you guys are better than that
It is heartbreaking to see a BCU partnership with a transphobic and anti-Semitic franchise. As a longtime fan who happens to be trans, this is really disappointing.
cringe to accept sponsorship from a game surrounded with controversy for transphobia and antisemitism. unsubscribed
YEAH BABY USA ALWAYS DOES IT BETTER
Based. Don't support trains
could you not accept a sponsorship from blood libel: the game like come on. did almost a month of controversy just fly over your head or are you just willfully ignorant
Well I enjoyed your content but I can't anymore seeing you take money from a game whose IP owner wants me and others like me dead.
hey bestie bad choice of sponsorship
sad to see u accept the sponser of an antisemitic and transphobic game as a transgender jew it just kinda sucks  obviously ur a cooking channel and stuff like this shouldnt matter but aaa sad to see that stuff
Trans woman here, and fan of yours. We watch your videos all the time. But this sponsorship… not a great look, my dude. I imagine it seems small from the outside, but you gotta pair it with everything being aimed at trans folk right now and, well, forever. There are so many laws trying to be passed against us and JK is using her platform to fund clinics in Ireland whose policy is to specifically not offer their service to trans people, writes a book about her experience with us, and whose tweets fuel anti-trans sentiment.  Would appreciate some consideration.
Disappointed with the sponsorship from the antisemitic and transphobic game.
It's disappointing to see you be sponsored by a game that directly supports transphobic practices. :(
Unsubscribed.
The amount of people malding in these comments over the sponsorship is hilarious. People really think that a video game is the biggest social crisis of our generation.
Actually, in a traditional English breakfast, your teacher, Professor Eleazar Fig, dies at the end of the game, and Rookwood is the one who cursed Anne.
it is so sad to see that money means more to you than supporting jewish & trans people. unsubscribed, there’s no way you guys didn’t know what you are supporting
I LOL when he said he added plain toast for . . . Health.
I like my mushrooms Medium well. Not rare lol
I guess I shouldn't expect the best political beliefs for a cooking channel, but I'm disappointed in seeing you sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy. Like it or not, you're contributing to the financial success of a transphobe. You may not believe if, but she certainly does
I'm really bummed that you chose to partner with them (and, by extension, their creator). That's really disappointing.
I'm very disappointed by this. Unsubscribed. Do better and don't take sponsorship deals from JKR as she's actively trying to erase trans people from existence
LETS GOOOO HOGWARTS LEGACY BABYYYY
Not gonna lie, when I saw the tomato on the plate my brain instantly went to the Denethor eating a tomato scene from LotR's.
Hey man, been a subscriber for 2 years or so now. I think it really sucks that you're taking ads from Hogwarts Legacy. Gonna give you a chance to move off of it, but likely to unsubscribe.
Enjoy your sponsorship blood money Andrew.
Luckily up here in Canada we still have a lot of leftovers from being in the commonwealth, including easy to find British breakfast foods.
I’ve always wanted to try make this dish, glad to see Babish make a vid giving steps on how to do so .
I won't be unsubbing for one simple reason:  I don't care about the nontroversy surrounding this game.  The only reason I'm being forced to comment on it is because a small obnoxious group of losers who have nothing better to do with their lives than spend their every waking second on twatter and facebook just can't accept the fact that the public at large doesn't care enough about what they're whining about to pay attention too it so they came crashing in here like a bunch of obnoxious yobbos too disrupt the comments section so we can't have real conversations about it.  Just accept the fact that you lost, then shut up and move on too the next poutrage you find that will occupy your life for a couple of months and leave the rest of us alone to enjoy life free of your being a public nuisance.
Hi Andrew, just a message to let you know, that I'm quitting your channel, because you have chosen to promote the work of a bigoted lunatic. At some point in the future, you're going to be asked if you stood up, when Trans People were being vilified and murdered, and said no to it. Will your answer be silence? Atrocity isn't fueled by the hateful, but by the indifferent.
YWNBWB (You will never binge with babish)
Very disappointing sponsorship.
*black pudding
it's likely the HP sponsorship deal happened before the dustup but it's still a bummer to see
Not sure how you take suggestions but the fish sandwhich from "Nope" wouild be neat, ngl "tartar got tang" has been on my mind since i watched it
I was in England in Exeter as a student learning English language for a month or so  My breakfast was one fried egg and one toast like other student I was hungry  That’s how I remember English breakfast
As a trans person this video is cool.
Seeing more comments about how the breakfast is slightly off from being correct than the sponsor from the Antisemitism blood libel anti-trans game is super disappointing. Seeing the sponsorship itself is super disappointing. Was a big fan of the channel before but I cannot continue to support or subscribe if these are the kind of things that are going to be promoted on it.
Very sad to see you accept money from HP after it's transphobia and antisemitism have been widely discussed.
It makes me feel sad that you didn't say anything to support trans people in this video
The ratio is justified. Deserve way more dislikes
That can flip was painful to watch
Great vid. Full english is something i've always wanted to try.
As a trans person who has been following you for years it pretty disappointing you’re taking a sponsorship from a game that gives money to a huge transphobe. Do you not have enough other sponsorships that you needed to take this one? Really hope this channel doesn’t go the way of Bon Appetite but it feels like the cracks are showing :/
300k views less because they're butthurt over the sponsor.
So we’re really cool with taking a sponsor that will directly benefit a known transphobic bigot? We’re doing that now, eh? 🙃
I am a long term fan, please do not accept more advertisements from Hogwarts legacy.
Super disappointed to see you take money from and record for the terf and blood libel game VO’d be serial abusers. Can’t recommend you to friends anymore.
So disappointing to see such a capable and successful channel take money from Blood Libel: The Video Game when it can clearly stand to turn down the offer and accept or seek a different sponsorship.

It's not that far off from what I eat in USA..
Kinda surprised Babish would be associated with something by JK Rowling
Not taking money from the terf franchise 😬
Unsubscribed
Disappointed in your choice of sponsor. It’s designed by someone alt right and features rampant antisemitism. The proceeds are going to someone actively campaigning against transpeople. Please rethink this partnership.
cringe
i've been watching Babish for years but today's my last day. extremely disappointed that you chose to accept this ad.
Disappointed by your sponsor today. Don’t support the TERFs, Andrew. Be Better, Babish.
Great episode ❤
Stopped watching at the ad.
Long time viewer but no more, you're accepting money from someone who wants me and people like me dead to help flog a product that outright funds anti-trans organizations, which are the reason friends of mine in the UK can no longer get essential healthcare.  Shame, but you decided money was more important than actually having a sense of character and being an ally.  I weep for any GSRM friends of yours who still think you value their safety over money.
You should try to make the sandvich from tf2
nice to see you're into the blood libel game, babish. congrats on losing the trust of your jewish and trans subscribers
Andrew, I've been watching your channel for years and you've genuinely helped me discover my love of cooking. That said, I'm really disappointed you'd use your channel for marketing a game that supports hate. I really expected better.
love me a Full English Breakfast
I have never actually had bubble and squeak. I always have hash browns. Also sunny side up eggs are widely accepted as the better of the two (you can dip sausage or fried bread in the yolks). The on vine tomatoes are perfect though
Really Babish, advertising for the Transphobic Blood Libel wizard game?!?! You're better than this
Been a subscriber for a number of years and it's incredibly disappointing to see that you accepted a sponsorship from this game. I'll be learning future cooking tips and tricks from other YouTube chefs and unsubscribing from this channel.
sad you took money from the blood libel game though😢
This sucks.
Bye babby
I'm very disappointed you took this sponsorship, do better. Unsubscribed :(.
Gotta say, the Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship was a nasty surprise. Pretty disappointed to see a channel I enjoy taking money from the world's most famous transphobe (/antisemite/etc.). Expected better.
Taking money from a bigoted game backed by bigoted supporters lining the pockets of one of the single most destructively transphobic people isn’t very cash money of you Andrew. Unsubscribed, hope others with a conscience decide to as well
Eat pork, and die early...
Really disappointed to see this sponsor. Babish, you're funding alt-right lunacy and TERFs with this video.
Very disappointing sponsorship. Unsubscribed and cookbook pre-order cancelled.
really sad that you decided to promote this. unsbubbing. do better.
jk rowling game sponsorship =(
Blood libel the meal
Embarassing video
Surprised and disappointed to see that Babish is taking this sponsorship. See you later man, not hanging around someone taking money from a TERF's IP.
scottish and trans here. too much going on politically to ignore rowlings devestating impact on our culture
Oh...that's unfortunate.  Babish went in on the TERF game. Alright I'm out hope the money was at least worth tell trans people we aren't welcome here.
Why did u have to promote hogwarts legacy
At first I thought this was the English breakfast from Trainspotting (and don't forget spud making "mashed potatoes" in the bed) 😉
Disappointed by this sponsorship.
Like people are still going to go and leave negative comments under your videos regardless of if you delete them lol
Disappointed to see you take this ad, I'm going to be unsubscribing
Erasing comments doesn't get rid of them
Hogwarts legacy is xenophobic and transphobic. And to promote the game is to promote anti-Semitism and anti-trans ideology. Disappointed in this channel for partnering with them.
Babish embarrassment
Cringing with babish
Huge bummer to see the shilling for Hogwarts Legacy. There's no way Babish and his team aren't aware of Rowling's rampant transphobia and antisemitism. 🙃
Ngl I'm surprised you said yes to the sponsorship with all the controversy surrounding it.
British babish embarrassment
If anyone runs out of salt the snowflake tears in the comments are plentiful.
Babish execution
Very disappointed to see Babish taking a sponsor from Hogwarts Legacy. Hope you address this sooner rather than later.
Babish embarrassment

so many games out there to play! why not just skip this one :)
Babish bigot embarrassment
unsubscribing explicit support of jkrs bigotry is absolutely disgusting
You nailed it at the end, Babish. American breakfast sausage sucks.
speaking as someone from the uk, i finally understand what it feels like when babish gets a dish slightly wrong. looking at you, italians   i’m jesting, babby <3
Oh babish no... please no. I'm so shocked you're supporting this awful game.
Jeez whats wrong wit yall let him make a few bucks from a sponsorship
Honestly disappointing to see you take a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy.
This reminds me of the breakfast from "Luck of the Irish" lol
You're Jewish and took a sponsorship from JKR's antisemitic video game? Why?
The hogwarts legacy sponsor is really disappointing.
👍🏾
Clicked off 10 seconds in after seeing the sponsor. Very disappointed that BCU would support such an open and prolific transphobe her antisemitic video game
Don't listen to the hype, Hogwarts Legacy is selling like hot cakes for a reason. It's a great game, SJWs just get triggered about it.
That is not Canadian bacon.  Canadian bacon is wet cured back bacon that has been rolled in cornmeal.
Man… this show never fails to make me hungry even when I’m full
Bro Babish alerted the hoard
🍿Giving out candy and popcorn for those here to point and laugh at the comment section! 🍬
Ignore the triggered troons. Great video.
I hereby rename this comment section "The City of Copenseethen"
Have to say it's really disappointing to see that you took a Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship. Going to be unsubscribing because of that.
No babish not hogwarts legacy 😭
Comments section: Seething with Mannish
Deeply disappointed by this sponso. Gonna unsubscribe.
This disgusting plate of diabetes and clogged arteries definitely explains why the French hate the English. 😂
I came back to check the outrage comments and I'm not disappointed. Cope, seethe & dilate lol.
Love the content and ignore the SJWs getting angry over todays sponser: the best game of 2023 so far.
No money to JK Rowling.
Dont use canola oil. Terrible for you. Inflammation station.
i was really hoping the "american version" was gonna be straight up a waffle house all-star special
based babish purging his fanbase of """women"""
All we needed was Adam from Beardmeetsfood to clean the English plate.
Unsubbed after six years because I don't support transphobes or the spineless individuals who would take their money. Also antisemites. lol
Disappointing to see you taking a sponsorship from a game whose IP was created by someone who is actively using royalties to fund anti-trans legislation, not to mention the several openly alt-right people behind the creation of the game profiting off of it and serious antisemitism within it😬
didn't you do a full english breakfast before? Europhiles are weird.
Why are you allowing yourself to be sponsored by a game that supports a transphobic person? I thought you were a better group of people than this. Repost this episode without this anti-trans ad and apologize. Thank you.
im being honest but, are those really "american breakfast sausages"? they look so tiny
Loved BCU's content for years, but yea , nah, this isn't cool
Sigh. Really, the anti-Semitic game that puts money in the pockets of the crazy anti-trans lady? I'm really disappointed in you guys.
cringing with babish
Imagine how outnumbered you are, if you're a boycotter. Sad existence   trying to police entertainment, seeing bad things where there are none
thanks for supporting a transphobic and violently antisemitic video game for money! that's just truly gross. been a subscriber for a long time, will no longer be consuming bcu content since you endorse this game. really upsetting.
Lol that sponsorship. See ya babish, ur content is easily replaceable
I'm disappointed you would sponsor this game. Please do better.
Great video! Will have to def try out the recipe on my own
Ah yes my favorite show, Blood Libel With Babish.
Bro are you seriously gonna do an add for Hogwarts Legacy? Didn't know you were transphobic... Unsubsribed.
cringing with babish. way to accept transphobic blood money 😒
Thank you for boosting a game that promotes trans-inclusivity! It means a lot.
I'm disappointed in you.
I'm surprised not to see anyone angry at the Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship.
Disappointed but not surprised. any money made from that game funds transphobia in the UK, and the game itself has blatant antisemitism all over it—not to mention one of the leads on the project is a straight up neonazi.  been a sub for quite a while, but I’m unsubbing until this is revoked. I’m just a drop in the ocean, I know, but I hope other people see this comment and follow suit.  Could have done an English breakfast without the sponsor.
Was express vpn and hello fresh not giving out sponsorships this month or what like were we that desperate for terf money
>start the video >see Andrew making bubble and squeak instead of hashbrowns, and making b+s using fresh ingredients instead of leftovers >close the video
cringing with babish, this sucks man, get better sponsors
As a long time fan of this channel, I am profoundly hurt and disappointed by the choice of sponsor. It’s an easy choice not to ally yourself with hate, but glad to know this channel will support bigots for a paycheque.
Heinz being in the international aisle is the most wild concept to me (Australian)
Giving a like because Hogwarts Legacy is Awesome.
You can tell it’s an authentic English recipe because it makes sure to start with a transphobic sponsor.
The tomatoes look nice, but please! I don't want that whole vine on my plate. I wish chefs would pick a lane: either make it pretty or edible, none of this in between stuff! It it's meant to be eaten, please take it off the vine. You're the chef, that's your JOB!
Really disappointed to see the BCU get behind anything associated with hard-core reactionary transphobe JK Rowling. Her rhetoric and platform have served to stoke violent hatred toward my trans friends and colleagues. Please don't support her cause in the future Babish
Laughing at the morons crying about the Hogwarts sponsorship 🤣
The beauty of a full English is Eggs bacon sausage are mandatory then add or not the other ingredients as suits your taste..however..eggs are fried sunny side up or scrambled, I personally always use smoked back bacon,the black pudding is usually twice the diameter of the type you used,plum tomatoes,halved beef tomatoes,halved standard cheap tomatoes are all fine even cherry as you used,button or sliced portabello mushroom are commonly used.frankly you did a decent job...however!!!!!!3 major options missed .....heinz tomato ketchup,HP or Daddies brown sauce and lea and Perrin's worcestershire sauce.
I really like your channel but I'm wholly uninterested in supporting any content that supports the Harry Potter game.
I mean, if you reallllly wanted this to be authentic English you would be cooking without salt.
I love your videos. It’s sad to see you accept a sponsor from Hogwarts Legacy.
I love tomatoes with breakfast food, but I always preferred them fresh to contrast the other warm and soft foods.   Also, nothing to do with Babish, but I don't think I've ever wanted to play a game less than Hogwarts Legacy, and I keep getting ads for it
Andrew, I'm very disappointed in your choice of sponsorship. Either you don't know about JK's transphobia and the trans community's request to boycott the game, or you don't care. Or you don't play the games you sponsor, because the game is filled with antisemitic dog whistles.  Very, very disappointed.
Full scottish breakfast please
Well, that's a disappointing sponsorship.
Hogwarts legacy sponsorship :(
Very disappointing behavior to see from a creator I'd previously respected. If you're going to be supporting someone as blatantly horrific as Rowling, I feel I have no choice but to say farewell.
Also disappointing to find another channel that supports a TERF and a transphobe.
disappointing you took this sponsorship of all things, hard to come back from this 👍
I respect the hustle but with a sponsor from Hogwarts Legacy I feel inclined to mention that JKR is a transphobe.
Very uncool of you to shill for the TERF Wizard game.
imagine being part of the loosers that disliked the video because of his hogwart legacy sponsor
Kind of disappointed by the sponsorship.
Really disappointed to see you take ad money for the terf game. It's not like the anti-trans and antisemitic views of JKR and the dev team have been a secret.
Yikes, last babish video I'm watching. Oh well
Hogwarts Legacy? Come on Babish, you're better than that.
Great, another cooking channel I loved is run by transphobes. Goodbye, Andrew. I'm burning your cookbooks.
It's a great game, I'm having lots of fun with it.  I'll just take all the meats please and thanks. 😋
ngl rlly disappointing to see this sponsorship :{{
that's a big cringe and unsub for me chief
No bubble and squeak
I'm disappointed with Babish for taking the terf money.
Don't see any comments disappointed by Babish accepting a sponsorship from the wizard game? A real shame, given everything.
Very disappointed you took blood libel money from the antisemetic game.
enjoy the money, hope it's worth the pr nightmare
Would love to see the Lemon Caper Chicken from The Bear!
Question, why accept a sponsorship from the harry potter game? Are you not aware of the horrible stuff JK Rowling supports and forces into her series? Please reply, I’m worried.
Unsubbing for Hogwarts Legacy sponsor. Really dissapointed
Just really disappointed, I always thought highly of you :(
This meal is so boring idk
Really disappointed to see who sponsored this episode. Unfortunately I can’t continue to support the channel.
You hate this video because its transphobic. I hate this video because its English. We are NOT the same.
Disappointing choice of sponsor. I'm sure you had better choices. I guess the anti-trans and anti-semitic things weren't considerations for you.
Ouch, I get you gotta take sponsors where you can get them but I thought you were better than this
binging with antisemitism
Disappointed in your sponsorship. Just... disappointed. Kind of would have expected better, but I guess not.
Day in the life of a true brexit geezer
Gotta admit it’s such a bummer to see you work with this game man.
Jesus by these replies you'd think HogWarts Legacy was murdering trans people with every sale. Talk about overdramatic.
Was already on about unsubscribing. Not into Alvin, originally subbed for the original concept of the show: making the food featured in other media. This channel has lost itself
Full Irish breakfast is clear
really disappointed in the choice to be sponsored by Hogwarts Blood Libel Game. :T I really wanted to feel safe on the babish page as a trans person, and have support for our jewish allies. money is money at the end of the day ig.
I just want to know who told Andrew we have bubble and squeak with our full english
Anyone else remember when Babish’s intro was “..tossed salads and scrambled eggs” feels like forever ago! 🖤
Thanks, now I’m craving a full English (especially the black pudding which is my favorite part!)
Was about to watch this video like every other Babish video then the Hogw@rts ad came up... I am so disappointed, not only is that game aiding JK in funding anti-trans laws in the UK but its also very anti-semtic. I don't usually boycott my favourite creators on Youtube but unless Andrew or someone from the BCU has a video comes out saying denouncing the game, I guess this is where I stop watching these videos, it makes me sad because I really love this channel my partner and I watch each of these videos the day it comes out.  Unfortunately for me playing these ads says you care more about money then Trans lives   I hope in future the people at BCU do a bit more research on a product before taking money from them.  From me to the BCU crew please listen to the Trans and Jewish voices who are speaking out against this game stand by them.
Man. You missed the PERFECT opportunity for a collab with this one with the channel Beard Meats Food
I'd do great violence. For that breakfast. So others could sleep with peace of mind.
Extremely disappointed that you would take money to advertise such a horribly antisemitic game.ive been a sub for a long time and am now unsubbing this is unacceptable.
yikes at the hogwarts legacy sponsorship unsubbed
cringing with babish
long time subscriber but taking sponsor money from a game that pushes antisemetic messages isn’t cool at all, i’m disappointed and unsubscribing
Disappointed that you agreed to this sponsorship. Don't make more money for JK Rowling!!! Supporting transphobia is a bad look.
so exactly how much did you get paid to sell your soul and tell your trans viewers that you don't respect them?
Taking a sponsorship to promote transphobia is disgusting. Do better.
Oh boy, I’m sure that sponsorship won’t bring out a hellish cult of highly sensitive mentally ill people.
🤢
Bruh, these hogwarts crybabies are even going after cooking shows. COOKING SHOWS!!!
I'm really disappointed to see you get money from a game that literally contains blood libel and had a white supremacist on the dev team. I get that you love Harry Potter but as a trans person your actions don't make me feel safe on your channel.
Those tomatoes are transphobic
CRINGING WITH BABISH! CRINGING WITH BABISH!!! CRINGING WITH BABISH!!!! lol
As a British person, this made me very uncomfortable to watch
Andrew, bro, are you not making enough scratch to turn down this TERFtrash game sponsorship?
incredibly disappointing. instant unsub
booooo I thought better of you, Babish. unsubscribed
Background music name plz?
cringing with babish. taking a sponsorship and putting money in the hands of a known bigot and transphobe is disgusting. extremely disappointed especially as someone whos been a subscriber since day one.
extremely disappointed in you, andrew. been a follower for years, but supporting this game and this franchise is more than enough to get me to unfollow. many more are too. i hope you learn from this.
Very disappointed with the sponsorship. First the nft thing and now this
Lol no at the sponsor. You mean where you can play SATAN'S BOARDING SCHOOL?
Based HL sponsorship. People, learn how to separate the author from the game. Keep on being badass Babish!
cringing with babish
Really disappointed in this sponsorship.
Shilling for Hogwarts Legacy, now thats what I call disappointing
i don't know everything about how sponsorships work or how big your channel is but it feels like you might be at a point where you could turn down a sponsorship from antisemitism/transphobia: The Game but idk
really? a HL sponsorship? Expected a lot better. Unsubscribed.
I am heart broken as a Jewish and Trans fan that you would decide to support this media.  I wouldn’t expect you to make a choice to hurt and alienate your audience like this. This isn’t a hate comment, I don’t hate Babish, I hate that he thought this choice was worth it. I didn’t know trans and Jewish lives had so little value to him.
really wished you hadn't dude.
For those who might not know but H Legacy is available on Nintendo Switch too
Sponsored by transphobia and antisemitism.
This isn't a cooked english, not even close.
really so strapped for cash you need to take TERF money?
Where are the peas, corn and carrots (and othr veggies) in the bubble and squeak!?
Unsubscribing for the Hogwarts plug. Really disappointed.
I have been a long time subscriber to you since you were basically just starting, the HP legacy sponsorship is beyond disappointing, I've always seen your channel as a place anyone especially members of the LGBTQIA+ can enjoy, seeing this sponsor make me quite sick.  Also bubble and squeak is not traditional to a Full English. Hash Browns are much more typical and the eggs are useally servers "sunny side up" and runny. Bangers as a term is outdated and useally refer to cheaper sausages that will explode when frying. Fried bread is a nice touch but that's much more of a regional thing, toast is more common.
I know this has been said already… But bubble and squeak is a different breakfast, made from the leftovers of a Sunday/Christmas dinner. You’d another have a full English, or bubble and squeak. You were missing hash browns from the full English and this is probably where the confusion was.   Bubble and squeak is made by using leftover mash potatoes (roast potatoes can just be mashed up too) with cabbage (or sometimes Brussel sprouts) along with leftover meat and an egg to hold it all together then fried as you did in the video.
Are y'all going to limit the comments here too? The damage is already done.
0:50 messed up already 😂. I have never had bubble and squeak  EDIT: turned out pretty well in the end 💪🏼
Disappointed you accepted this particular sponsor.
Pretty disappointed you're taking HP sponsorship. I think you're a better person than this
Great video.
I know you have to get your money somehow but the ad put a terrible taste in my mouth before the recipe even started .
You messed it up
really could've done without that sponsorship
Curious of how familiar you are with the controversy surrounding your sponsor? The Babish Team has always seemed like a very accepting sort of bunch, so I’d hate to be disappointed to learn that this is more than just a blind spot
Not enjoying this sponsorship. Lots of real issues with that game.
Lol at shilling for that game.
Ew terf game sponsor
Full English is the ultimate hangover breakfast, no competition
so disappointing
The King of breakfasts. Satisfying, filling and energising every time. Don’t forget the white pepper - gorgeous.
Please drop the sponsor for this video.... you may not know but J.K.R is wildly transphobic and the game has so much antisemitism in it.
embarassing move by babish
I'm well happy babish prefers bangers
Trans follower of at least three years checking in. Hugely disappointed with this. Unsubscribing.
nah I’m gone, don’t promote a game that is pro-slavery and heavily steeped in Antisemitism (not to mention benefits JKR’s transphobic agenda)
Bubble and skweak with a full breaky? Really don't think that's traditional dude...also we don't automatically call sausages bangers, generally they're just called that when part of "bangers and mash"
massively dissapointing that you would take money from a game you can't possible have not heard the outrage about. do you not care about your trans and Jewish subscribers? or is money more important than the bare minimum of supporting deeply marginalized people to you? unsubscribed.
awesome video, and thanks for recommending the amazing game!
i dont think anyone in the UK has eaten bubble and squeek in a fry-up since the 1960's
Also where's the HP Sauce, Andrew
Love you babish, but I will never support anything HP again. I will not give my money or attention to transphobes. I know you need to take sponsorships to run the channel, but I hope you got paid up front instead of from forwards.
Blood sausage is really underrated! All looks great.  shame about the sponsor tho
Would prefer if you didn’t accept sponsorship money from a game that profits off of antisemitic tropes and originated from a story written by an obsessed transphobe though.
My man, you have no idea how many times people have told me how great my cooking is when in actuality I'm just following your recipes to a T.  Thanks for the videos.
Aww man don't be repping that transphobic horror
Looks like Babish will get the can for being sponsered by Hogwarts Legacy. Oh no lol.
this is the most disgusting thing this bald man has ever made in his entire life
Very disappointed. Unsubscribing
Thank you, Babish, for siding with JK Rowling. Traitor.
The perfect accompaniment for a full English breakfast is a nice cold pint. Especially at 8am in the morning. Marvellous.
Unsubscribe
As a longtime fan who is a member of multiple minoritized communities that are harmed by the story told in this game, and Joanne herself, I've very disappointed in you for taking this sponsorship. I hope the blood money was worth it.
I am English and we never have bubble and squeak with a full English- hash browns for the win , also we have toast  instead of fried bread, eggs are always sunny side up not over easy, and the sausages  are called sausages - but everything else on point ! :) PS love this channel
Why the cheery tomatoes?
A) that isn’t bubble and squeak and b) bubble and squeak doesn’t go on a full English
Just another comment here to say no we don't have bubble and squeak😂 we too have hash browns. And the name bangers is only acceptable if you're having "bangers and mash" otherwise they're just sausages 😂
the amount of dislikes made me chuckle
looks great, but i'm kinda sad you're taking money from a terf
Disappointed to see you working with Hogwarts Legacy, man.
Always wanted to try it never got the chance (though I'd probably clog the rest of my bloodvessels)  PS. Hopefully the sponsorship won't cause you any problems, but with the ongoing witch-hunt it's kinda risky.
disappointing to see you shill for transphobes, but have fun I guess
Really disappointed to see the TERFs game advertised here.
What a disappointing sponsorship choice.
Babby why?
Somewhat disappointed you're accepting sponsorship from the antisemitic transphobe wizard game...
Very disappointing sponsorship, ruining one of my favourite channels.
Kinda disappointed you accepted sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy, knowing all the controversy surrounding it...
How disappointing...
I live in the UK and I have never seen full English with bubble and squeak, its always hash browns as far as I know. Cant imagine it being bad though...
Didn’t think I’d have unsubscribe from babish on my todo list today but here we are.
I appreciate you putting the sponsor right at the beginning so I knew I couldn't watch it. I have been a fan for many years and I am kinda shocked that this would be a sponsor tbh. I thought this was a relatively inclusive and supportive universe, but I suppose not. Please just look into why we are upset in you supporting this game specifically.
This ain't it
Already knew what this comment section would look like the moment I saw the sponsor.  Keep the hard work dude. Dont let them get a piece of your time.
Seriously?
Hogwash Lunacy...
I assume by the sponsor this time that you don't have any Trans people in your circles
We don't eat bubble and squeak as part of a full English, eat make it out of the left overs from a Sunday roast.
Dicey move to take that sponsorship.
Are we deleting negative comments? 🤔
Only thing missing is a pint of tea.
Really sad to see you taking money from transphobes, Andrew.
Been watching for a few years now, disappointed to see you take a sponsor from hogwarts legacy.
Transphobe ad content
bro aren't you jewish?????? WHAT are you doing with this sponsor????
All the people disliking because of the sponsor are cringe.
Full Scottish is so much better than that poopoo English stuff
I've been a subscriber since you posted the timpano video on r/food, and I've loved your channel all these years. It's incredibly disappointing to see you taking money from this game, given how overtly transphobic, antisemitic, and racist JK is. You're supposed to be better than this.
did you have to advertise the jew hating transphobe’s wizard game? do you have any idea how many people you’re letting down by lending your voice to the creation of one of the worst stochastic terrorists of our time? we’re being murdered and legislated out of existence and every dollar in JKR’s pocket contributes to those campaigns. i’m so terribly disappointed
A breakfast series of different countries would be awesome, I saw a Filipino breakfast that looked delicious!
Great video as ever, but sad to see the sponsor of the video. I don't mind the videos you've done about Harry Potter as they don't support JK and give her money to donate to anti-trans organisations. The game, however, does so. A big shame that they were the sponsor of the video.
Looks Tasty! Love the content, keep it up! 👏
Well, dang. It would be an understatement to say I love your channel, Babish. Been a subscriber and downloaded for a couple of years now. In presentation, helpfulness, accessibility, and humor BwB was far and away one of my favorite channels, and my favorite cooking channel.  Which is why it stings to see you taking a sponsorship from this game. I might have chosen more heated language than that, had I not been a fan for so long. But I have, and I hope the lack of more heated language helps this small reaction register more than it otherwise would: I don’t want to subscribe to, to give money and support to, a channel that takes money from a game that peddles in antisemitic tropes, and helps foster exposure and credibility for one of the world’s most prominent transphobic bigots.  And so I won’t. I eagerly sat down to watch this one, and it brought me down to see the sponsorship. I suspect any number of fellow commentators, and other Babish fans, might have plenty to say about my posting this comment…but as wonderful as your content is, there are other-not as enjoyable, not as humorous, not as accessible, true-cooking channels that don’t platform antisemitism and transphobia.  Thanks for all the amazing content. You can do better.
hog leg sponsorship 🤢🤢🤢
JK Rowling is a pro-fascist bigot and she's said that royalties from this game promote her genocidal views.
Are youtubers seriously partnering with Hogwarts Legacy? Is this really happening? Can we please denouce this kind of practice? The entire idea for the video almost feels like an add campaign that isn't directly apparent, like you are hiding the project of making a Harry Potter refference and such. I don't know, just felt like sharing the gut punch I experienced hearing the advert at the start.  Bye Babish.
are you somehow unaware of how much bigotry is in harry potter blood libel game.
No peas in the bubble and squeak? Interesting. To be fair, there's no set way its usually just leftover mash and veggies. Eggs as always sunny side up (not over easy) in and English Breakfast.
disappointed you took a brand deal for a game that directly monetarily supports the suffering of trans people across the world. do better
Commenting to boost the algorithm and send my support. Ignore the hate mob, bending the knee to them is never the answer. Never negotiate with terrorists.
If it was TRULY full English it would be called BREKKY and NOT Breakfast.😊
Very disappointed to see you take the transphobe money
Really disappointed to see you promoting hateful trash like Hogwarts Legacy. Thats an unsubscribe from me.
Just lost a sub forever. Guess everyone's a transphobe as long as there's money to be made from it.   😞
Awful sponsor choice
Bubble and squeak is extremely rare for a full English, hash browns are more common. Bubble and squeak is made using leftovers of roast dinners or similar, being an amalgamation of meat, potato and vegetables fried off then normally covered in Gravy
Cooking man accepts terf money
Awful choice of sponsor. Deeply alienating to your Jewish, Muslim, transgender, POC, Black, etc audience. Absolutely garbage stuff. You don't need the money from this sponsorship. This sucks
Wildly disappointed with you taking this sponsorship.
You're deadass promoting the wizard game? I don't even care about the discourse over playing it, but the fact that you're getting paid to promote it does not set well with me, and I'm sure the same goes for your Jewish and trans viewers
today's sponsor is cringe
Oh that looks very cool
Gonna need some freshly ground black pepper to go with all the kosher salt in the comments.
I just need to say, as a Brit... We don't call Sausages "Bangers" outside of the context of Bangers & Mash. We also don't use Bubble & Squeak as part of a Full English Breakfast, but rather we make it from the leftovers of a Sunday Roast Dinner. And of course, we do, in fact, use hash browns, but given you made the typical british shape for those, I assume you knew that.  Also, serve eggs like you did on the "british" attempt and I will not tell you anything's wrong, but I will nonetheless be mildly disappointed.  If this is any amount of trolling, then well done, you can stop now.
I love all the misogynists in the comments crying about the "transphobic" sponsor.
Not sure about the 'authenticity' of bubble & squeak - in 35 years, I've never seen or had bubble & squeak with a Full English!!  Used to be chips or sometimes sautéed potatoes, nowadays hash browns are the 'go to' (although not really  'English')
Disappointing
Bad choice of sponsor, do better babish
Please do a Scottish full breakfast variation of this 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
You got me into cooking, but I'm sad to see your true colours, byeee✌️
love the video as always, but very disappointed with your choice of sponsors.😞
Very unfortunate sponsor. Great cooking. 👍
Dude. It’s so easy to not support transphobes. It takes literally zero effort to just not give them your money or accept their money. It’s not like you’re hurting for advertisers, you could have said no.
I asked one of my best friends how authentic this was but she slapped me with her oversized whiskey mug, saying she's Irish. I guess I'll never know...
That sweet sweet Ad money for a game noone should play. I would prefer you didn't support JKR.
Andy please don’t back down. Hogwarts Legacy was made by honest game devs with love in their hearts that have the rational ability to separate an IP from its creator. Keep doing what you do.
nowe dish ish how we gdew it en Engerland laddie
For all those saying hash browns are more Conan than bubble , yes now  But 20/25 years ago it was the other way around and bubble was traditionally served with breakfast
Biscuits with tomatoes and gravy is probably one of the best breakfasts ever but I’ve never seen a place offer it.
It's a shame you took this sponsor. Let's just hope you don't make this worse.
While I'd love to give the Full English a try, I shall be content with my home breakfast artery clogger: the Saint Louis Slinger. The composition varies by establishment and customer, but as follows: A plate-wide bed of loose hash brown, topped with two ladles worth of diner-style chili, sausage gravy or both, meat of choice (2 hamburgers, 2 sausage patties, 4 slices of bacon, hamsteak, or a flat iron steak), topping the meat is 2 eggs cooked your way, shred a half-cup of cheddar or American Cheese, and garnish with diced onion.
Remember, any time a recipe says to peel potatoes, simply do not do that and the food will be better
Had my first english breakfast when i travelled to a pub in Birmingham.  I was not impressed.  I did enjoy how lively people were at 10am.
Was validating the terf blood libel game worth the paycheck, Andrew?
That’s a yikes of a sponsorship
I would say bubble and squeak is better with spring greens than cabbage
I have traveled around England and Ireland, and never had potatoes of any kind. Only in the US.
...no one gonna mention the undercooked bacon? 😱
Accepting a sponsorship from the terf? What a shame, I had enjoyed your channel.
this comments section is a warzone wow
kinda disappointed to see you accept a sponsor from the transphobia antisemitism game :/
So is the American one just a grand slam?
Snowed in rn and absolutely can't go to the store to make myself a delicious din. I can't resist cooking videos but man why'd I do this to myself 😂
Aww, man that sucks, used to realy like his stuff. Anyone got recomendations for kitchen youtubers?
Don't worry about the screechers, Babish. Their opinions are the minority of a minority.
Very surprised at the sponsor... secure the bag but you seem like the type of dude that would have posted a warning or something about this.
Pick better sponsors, Babish.
Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship? that's a no from me dog. I'll see myself out. no room in this house for transphobia or supporting transphobes.
disappointed.
Bubble and squeak is not in a full English sorry Babish and the fried eggs are usually sunny side up
Not the greatest choice of sponsor 😕
Unsubscribed, so sad to see you accept a deal with this sponsor.
Not gonna lie, kinda disappointed you’re shilling magic transphobe blood libel simulator
The fried bread should more literally be a shallow fried slice of white bread. I think you more "toasted" it here.
11k likes to 4k dislikes rn. Hmm wonder why this is more disliked than usual
Really disappointed to see you team up with Blood Libel Simulator from the Queen of Transphobia. I've unsubscribed and I hope others do the same.
now do a full scottish
COME ON ENGERLAAAAAND, START PLAYING QUIDDITCH ALREADEH
Get sponsors from whoever you want.  Seriously, don't worry about what others say.  This looked delicious.
Can’t believe that Babish is pro slavery and eugenics. Thought you were better than this
honestly really disappointed that you would take that sponsorship
Look up a sketch from The Fast Show for an accurate depiction of a full english: "Chanel 9 cooking"  watch?v=et6HWai1V_c
No British brekky is finished without a 13 inch blade 🔪 🩸
Tread lightly Babish for you may be attacked by the fools who boycott a video game
jk rowling is actively harming trans people. don't support her or her properties if u support trans ppl.
Cool hogwarts legacy add there babbish.  That was sarcasm I'm actually just unsubscribing, it's been a fun 6 years at least.
Gamingcirclejerks mad again booh ohh, cry more.
Hash browns are definitely more common here. I legit don’t know anyone who has bubble and squeak on a full English
that black pudding was tiny.
I’d love you to make haggis as across the world it gets a bad rap but is actually really tasty
Congrats to 10 mil!
The full English was great man! But the back bacon needed more time!
harry potter ad block cringe
“I’m gonna try and make what I hope is a pretty authentic full English breakfast   So I’m gonna start with bubble and squeak”   Jesus 🤣🤣
Get a new sponsor.
I've been a fan of your videos for a really long time - I think I've seen basically every one - but I'm really disappointed in this new sponsorship deal, so I'm probably not going to be watching again for the foreseeable future. Idk if you even read the comments this deeply but yeah, just putting it out there.
I've been a fan of yours for a really long time and I'm honestly so disappointed to see you take a Hogwarts legacy sponsor
That bubble and squeak 🤢🤮
nice to see bubble and squeek on the menu dude. but uk we never turn the eggs. flick oil at the yolk until its almost done then serve. apart from that top work sir top work. il be over in 10.
No hp sauce. Disliked, unsubscribed, cops called
Sad to see you'd accept a sponsor that ultimately benefits a transphobe, have been watching for years. I'm out.
Really, really disappointing to see you taking money from WB and promoting the wizard game. The game, on its own merits and divorced from all of JK Rowlings deeply harmful anti-trans rhetoric, is still a game with severe antisemitism and made by people on the alt-right. The game has blood libel as an actual plot point. This was a bad decision to accept this sponsorship, and should be fixed.
Is that a pepper cannon!?
"This episode is sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy"  aaaaaaaaaaaand unsubscribed
Couldn’t you have not taken sponsorship money from an outwardly transphobic franchise?
I'd put this in the "fancy" full english category only because of the on-the-vine cherry tomatoes; normally it would just be a tomato cut in half and chucked on the flat top. And noooooo bubble and squeak .... not ever ... on my full english in my 50+ years of being a brit!  Also, you're missing the obligatory mug of tea to go with this full english.....!!
that TERF money sponsorship made me close this vid, first babish vid ive done that too ... feels bad :(
taking money from the transphobic blood libel game is a yikes from me and an unsub. do better.
i hope no one who saw this video buys the game 😌
HES TURNING INTO A RED COAT
Babish, I’m a big fan or your content, and while I know sponsorships are an important factor in content creation on YouTube, I’m asking you to please deny any further partnerships with Warner Brothers Games and Hogwarts Legacy. I know many are aware of J.K. Rowlings’ transphobia and while that should not be ignored, I want to acknowledge that the plot of the game itself is extremely antisemitic. Please do not stand by a game that raises issue both in its creation and its contents.
hey babish i'm a big fan but this sponsorship is really disappointing. there's been a lot written about the antisemitism present in this game, and as much as warner brothers tries to hide it, the money this game earns will be supporting jk rowling's anti-trans crusade in the uk. again, big fan of the channel, but if this sponsorship continues i will be unsubscribing. i think the bcu has built a great reputation of being on the "right side" of social issues and so this really disappointed me. i hope you listen to your trans and jewish fans who are hurt by this
Just a tip, fried bread is shallow fried in oil, no butter required and we never EVER over-easy our eggs! Other than that, decent fry up geezer!
Sorry to see this Babish and crew. I'll be taking my leave
Heart attack.
Bubble aside, if you served a full English with the first eggs, you'd be cleaning them off the floor. BAD BABISH! Sunny side up eggs are much more common with brekkie over here.
One minor correction. I do not know anyone in England who would call Sausages "Bangers" during Breakfast. Bangers and Mash is a specific dish served in the evening and even then is more commonly called Sausage and Mash. Oh and Bubble and Squeak is a definite rarity when it comes to a Full English.
All American breakfast and you pick Canadian bacon over ham
Respect for getting proper bacon but I’ve never heard of bubble and squeak on a breakfast, it’d be hash browns, we call blood sausage black pudding, and the tomato’s are normally tinned chopped toms not Cherry on the vine
Canceled the pre-order I had for your cookbook, pretty disappointed in you.
Bruh is gonna get so much unjust hate for the ad
i’ve been subscribed to this channel for years (since before your rick and morty szechuan sauce episode) but this sponsorship deal made me reverse course. i’m jewish, and some of my friends are transgender. to accept a sponsorship from and promote to your audience a piece of media with deeply antisemitic caricatures and a plot centered on the blood libel, while giving more money to a woman whose hateful agenda has made trans people less safe worldwide is a step too far. i regret supporting your growth if it had led to this.
Well, you just lost a long-term subscriber with that sponsorship.
The Full American/Canadian should be called a 4th of July breakfast to really trigger the Limeys.
babish in his not caring about trans people era
Sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy, eh
Ah the sweet sweet tomatoes. No tomatoes at the moment we have a shortage :(
Incredibly disappointing to see you take a sponsorship for a game that features very blatant antisemitic themes and gives royalties to JKR, who is actively pursuing transphobic political action in the UK. Unsubscribing.
love babish and the bcu very much but disappointed to see them sponsored by hogwarts legacy. and no this isn’t bullying, this is listening to trans people when they say they don’t want more money DIRECTLY in the hands of their abusers
As an Englishman I can say that was a great effort, however bubble and squeak is a weird addition, also it’s called black pudding not blood sausage 😂 that makes it sound gross 🤮
Well, it was a fun run
I've never cared for the sausage logs myself I like the sausage patties the best we eat Kuntry boy sausage yes spelled like that it's better than Williams sausage which seems to be the most common sausage I've seen
VERY disappointed in you Babish.  Unsubscribed.
I'm disappointed that you took a sponsorship from the hogwarts game. Surely you know how it's hurting trans people to continue to have money shoveled at JK rowling.
Ads upon ads upon ads... final cash grab I guess.
I prefer a hardy breakfast over trans peoples feelings
This is exactly what I need after a hangover.
disappointed in you babish. unsubscribing and not coming back until you acknowledge the hate that comes with hogwarts legacy. you are providing money to anti trans ideology.
Bubble and squeak is for dinner time left overs from the night before, its not for breakfast.
Seriously, Hogwarts legacy??? Do you not know how much a dumpster fire the game and the franchise are?!
Bro, hogwarts legacy.... really? What were you thinking taking this sponsorship? It is absolutely a slap in the face to all the trans people in your audience and all their allies. Would love to see you take down this episode, otherwise, cya never.
As a non-binary person thanks for telling me that you prioritise money over having even a sliver of a backbone as an ally to LGBTQ+ people by taking an ad for a game that financially benefits a person who is actively dehumanising people like me and other trans people for simply existing. I used to really enjoy your videos and this was a real slap in the face. Hope the money was worth it I guess.
>inb4 the JK Rolling comments
Uh oh he promoted “The Wizard Game” I shall stand guard less the Twatter mob come for Babish 😅
I am extremely disappointed to see that you are supportive of the anti -Semetic game from the anti-trans author.  The game is deeply biased in multiple ways, and it makes me sad that you would take money to promote such hate and bigotry.
Ah, I am so glad the comments had nothing to do with the episode sponsor. Too much of the internet has been so toxic about it
I dont approve of the whole sponsor by hogwarts thing
I wonder if all the downvotes are because of this videos sponsor.
no-one here cooks eggs over easy. Its either sunny side up, or occasionally poached in an english breakfast. And as for bubble and squeak, just no.
can’t roast a full English don’t know if it’s a northern thing but we call it a fry up
Black pudding is so amazing
I very much hope that you signed on to the sponsorship with Hogwarts Legacy without being aware of Rowling's views. She is actively harmful to the trans community. Please don't support her or any works related to her
At least 40 minutes baking for a breakfast plus extra time for preparations? Nope. I'll stick with eggs, porridge and ham on toast.
Taking this sponsor was a choice You didn't just passively and accidentally accept ad money, you actively chose to read that out loud.  You can't just pretend to be an ally, you either are or you aren't. You chose to show us money outweighs your morals.
Oophh. Loved your content but the hogwarts sponsorship is too much. Thanks for outing yourself, byeee
Cool recipe, will definitely try it out! Love your channel Babish!
MUH TERF WIZARD GAME  just say the the title of the game, cowards
bestie nooooo not the transphobe game with antisemitic stereotypes driving the entire goblin race
A full Scottish breakfast is so much better 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
I'm deeply disappointed in this channel for accepting a sponsorship from such a antisemitic and transphobic game. You're better than that Andrew and team.
First NFT's, and now HP trash...... Time to finally unsub.
Eughhhh TERF wizard game.
twitter did it, they canceled babish, never thought id see the day
Collobrating with TERFs and promoting their game? Is this really the statement you want to make to your LGBT fans?
Black pudding is gorgeous...
Great job but you should check out the far superior Full Irish breakfast.
Andrew!  So many sins!
Babish is going to get harassed due to the sponsor.
Dang, a bummer to see a sponsored ad that financially benefits JK Rowling. Are times really tough for the BCU?
Completely unsubscribing. Taking money from blood libel the video game is unacceptable
Bubble and squeak is it's own meal. We normally have hash browns. Also we rarely flip eggs. Sunny side up all day....
Nope. You support the one of the biggest hatemongers against trans people, I'm out.
You know what isn't part of a Full English Breakfast? The zeitgeist. Keep up the amazing content!
Really disappointed that you decided to be sponsored by this game, I'll unsubscribe and leave
I find it upsetting that you(r team) are either unaware of the controversy around supporting this game, or that this is the stance you ended up choosing. Sorry if this isn't a welcome opinion, y'all are welcome to your own, this just happens to be mine.
I'm a long-time viewer of the channel, and I've loved a ton of your videos and have used a bunch of your recipes as staple dinners, but I have to say, as a trans person, that Hogwarts legacy sponsorship felt like a punch to the gut. I really want to support you, but I can't do that if you're supporting bigots that want me gone. I hope that warner bros. Money is worth it.
Hahaha hogwarts boycott failed
30 years old, never had Bubble and Squeak for breaky.
Yuck TERF sponsorship BRO!
Really disappointed by the sponsorship.
fan for over 5 years, unsubbed for the terf sponsorship. ah well.
Super disappointed w your sponsor choice
Please don't support Hogwarts Legacy. The plot is antisemitic and the royalties that Rowling gets support her transphobia
Babish got that blood money with his newest sponsor 🙄
quit trying to humanize the british
Never seen bubble and squeek on a full English. If you want a potato element a tattie scone is traditional in a full Scottish breakfast. Also eggs would never be flipped for breakfast.
Cool, Babish is a transphobe. Epic.
looool its definitely nothig like what youd find in the uk but still looks tasty. worth notig bubble and squeak is made of scraps traditionally. doest taste right if you make it just for that
Disappointed you are sponsored by an antisemitic game making funds for a transphobic bigot. I thought much better of you sir
Well that's disappointing. Indirectly promoting crypto in the Cash App pitches was bad already, but straight up taking Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship? Not cool, man. Do better.
Love this channel but very disappointed to see collaboration with a rowling property.
Better with a Scottish breakfast, includes haggis pudding😍
I'm sure this comment is going to get downvote bombed, but I feel I must voice my disappointment that you accepted Hogwarts Legacy as a sponsor. At this point the discourse surrounding Harry Potter and JK Rowling is inescapable, and accepting money from them sends a message to your viewers. I don't expect trans issues to be as important to people who aren't directly impacted by them, and different people are going to make their own decisions about playing the game, but as a long time fan of the channel who is trans, it tells ME something. Enjoy your sponsorship money for getting more eyes on a product that directly funds transphobic rhetoric, I'll be over here feeling a little less welcome on your channel.
Yeah, but noo!
As a British person, my family and I tend to have this meal for dinner. I don't know if this is just us though.
Really disappointed in the sponsorship here.
Super disappointed by the sponsorship. I hope whatever they paid you was worth it. I as a trans person cannot continue to watch your channel anymore.
Wow, genuinely disappointed.
Anyone else amazed to see the evolution from "brought to you by square space" to "brought to you by Warner Bros Games"...been a fan for a long time and it is awesome to see.
You know how bad a game is when you have to advertise it!
Never had bubble and squeak with my full English before, we usually only make it from leftovers after a Sunday Roast (Which you should deffo make) because its cheap and easy and after all that work making a roast we are lazy AF.  There are also variations on the full English depending on where you live and then there is also the full Scottish, full Irish and full Welsh.
Weird sponsorship choice...
extremely dissapointed on you taking this sponsorship.  youve helped fund a hate campaign towards a minority. Im leaving.
immense disappointment from the ad :(( i never thought someone i’d watched for so long would support someone so awful
I can just imagine Ron Weasley stuffing his face with that breakfast
Sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy 🤡
On behalf of myself and the other trans folks out there - please make this the last time you take a sponsorship from something that supports JK Rowling.
taking a sponsorship from the wizard game is uhhhh bold choice
Immensely disappointed, have been a fan for years. Unsubscribed
Interestingly, bubble and squeak, at least in my slice of Sydney, Australia, has always been an excuse to finish-off a roast dinner.  Turkey, beef, lamb, spuds, pumpkin, and *literally* anything else from the night before that you cooked, and can be chopped or mashed. The result is similar to the recipes you made with Thanksgiving Day leftovers.
That’s a heartbreaker ad read 😢
Not a sponsorship I would have taken...
I suggest looking up JK Rowling's history of transphobia and seeing if you really want to keep that sponsorship.  I hate to say it but it sends the wrong message.
Agreed on the American breakfast sausage. My favorite is Irish sausage from a butcher in queens. Excellent stuff
Fried bread is usually deep or shallow fried, like you did the American hash browns.  It’s more just toast if griddled on a flat top.  Toast is probably more common than fried bread these days, more healthy?! LOL, is a fry up… it’s not supposed to be healthy.😂
That looks like a pepper cannon, so I'd point out that three twists is probably about 10 times more pepper than three twists on any other pepper grinder :-).
I recognize that I have no real influence here, but I must request that you not do ads that may generate income for JK Rowling. Please.
I was really looking forward to this episode when I saw the thumbnail, since my partner is British and I had a proper full English breakfast while visiting England.  I was disappointed to find it was sponsored by the Harry Potter video game, and for that reason I am not watching the video. I appreciate that you need to be able to pay the bills, but my British partner and I are both trans. The author of Harry Potter has taken a particular dislike to the trans community, and has put lots of money into making it more difficult for trans youth in Britain to get the healthcare they need.  This is all on top of the concerns I have heard from Jewish friends about the games' themes and story plot lines being overtly antisemitic in nature, which is a potentially much deeper issue that will have long-lasting effects on society.
This vid was great! (don't check twitter. )
HELLO. I am here to say Andrew, I hoped for better from you-- I'm really disappointed that you agreed to use your platform to promote Hogwarts Legacy. Trans people deserve our support, and that means not promoting a game that puts money in the pockets of JK Rowling, who uses her money to actively harm a marginalized community. I have followed this channel for years and am really sad to see you make such a callous decision.
Apologies to my Jewish friends on YouTube (if I had any)but he uses Kosher salt but will go on to make sausages/ bacon (pork)and the like - am I missing something?
Nice move with cayenne in the hash browns; you are, after all, the Chef John of getting your breakfast on
never been more heartbroken than when I saw the Hogwarts legacy sponsorship
Skips Scramble from Arrested Development would be another fun breakfast episode.
ALL TROONS ARE PEDOPHILES THAT WANT TO GROOM OUR CHILDREN
Really disappointing that you would take on this sponsorship.
I tried black pudding once... never again😩 Sorry, England
Highly disappointed in you for taking money from such a wildly transphobic, ableist, anti-Semitic, and racist game/creator
Eggsshouldbe sunny side up and as others have said, bubble and squeak is really a separate meal. Otherwise a decent effort, nice to see you included black pudding
TRANS WOMEN ARE MEN  TRANS MEN ARE WOMEN
whoops, gotta unsubscribe!
unhappy with your decision to promote a game that helps a transphobe and pushes antisemitism.
I'm conflicted here. I enjoy this channel. And you're big enough to have your pick of sponsors. You couldn't pick one less icky?
You forgot the brown sauce.  Gotta have a blob of HP or Daddies on the side.
Do you realize you killed 9 zillion trans people by uttering the word Hogwarts?
Very disappointed in Babish for taking this sponsorship. I don't feel right subscribing to a creator who makes money off the promotion of a game with such clear and present antisemitism. Not to mention the comments made by JKR. You can do better.
The people engaging in deranged virtue signaling over the sponsorship in the comments are doing more harm to trans people than the sponsorship ever could.  Thankfully such people remain nothing more than an obnoxious minority.
Is Bubble & Squeak a Northern breakfast thing? Always had hash browns. Bubble & squeak is more a Boxing Day food. Weirdly the American take, but with proper bacon, sosies and some black pudding is more like the English Breakfasts we have in this part of the UK.
No one has whatever that bubble and squeak was with a full english anymore. XD It's hasg browns, normal toast too btw, not fried bread. And we usually half big tomatoes and fry them, not cherry tomatoes or the giant ones. Even though I don't personally like them. :P But yeah, our normal sausages are way better than the over flavoured ones most other places have and our rashers as they're called here are better too. That best way to get them from a butcher is to ask for back gammon bacon if you're not from the UK or Ireland. Not many people are even gonna make this with butter either. XD
A sponsorship from Hogwarts legacy is not it, don't want that antisemitic terfy bs anywhere. Gonna have to unsubscribe
So you decided that your trans and jewish fans are worth less than a sponsorship for a highly anti-semitic game that benefits a terf calling for the death of minorities. Guess that's a choice, hope you enjoy what they paid. Because this was a one-time payment for you, but those fans are definitely not going to forget this.
Very disappointed in the promo partner here.
Babish deleting the comments disappointed for the HL sponsorship, but leaving all of the transphobic comments up.   Nice priorities my dude.
=( Come'on Babish =( Please don't promote the blood libel/ anti-trans game =(
Have loved you for years, but very disappointed you took sponsorship money from anything associated with JKR.
all that utensils change makes me cringe
Saddened to see Babish supporting Hogwarts Legacy, a game with bigoted, antisemitic themes that funnels money directly to anti-trans causes via its IP owner.  Disappointing and harmful. 😢
"This episode was sponsidered by Hogw-"  I'll pass, thanks.
Hoes mad, hoes mad!
Please don’t accept sponsorships from Rowling… :(
UH OH HE MENTIONED DA WIZARD GAME OH NO  TROONS MAD  YOU WILL NEVER BE A WOMAN
A proper fry-up will never feature poncy vine tomatoes and the best fried bread is cooked in lard. Also bubble-and-squeak not usually part of an English breakfast. More commonly served at tea time, possibly with a fried or poached egg. Nice effort otherwise. 👍
The comments not absolutely murdering Babish for promoting Hogwarts Legacy is giving me hope.
:)          .
Disgusting, but based on the way you treat your employees it’s clear you have no care for the well-being of others. Delete this too coward.
Man cmon
Please dont support that game or JKR. Disapointed to see her reach infecting these videos as well. Trans people just want peace, but she wont stop. A girl was literally just murdered.
Lose the bubble and squeak, add haggis and Stornoway black pudding and Scottish breakfast be had!
Love your channel and have a ton of respect for you, Andrew. I'm really disappointed to see you advertise a game that benefits an anti-trans bigot and the lead designer of which is an anti-feminist gamergate troll. I hope this is an oversight and your team can do alittle more on your behalf not to support junk like this.
Babish i love the content but please don't support the antisemite/transphobe game
The disappointment I had in you bibbish when I saw that hogwarts logo.
I’d suggest blood sausage next time, to match the blood libel in the anti-Semitic garbage you’re sponsored by 😊
Why so many dislikes? I thought he did a pretty decent job...
Your bubble and squeak is too thick. It needs to be crispy and crunchy with a mash centre. Ideally it should be pounded down to about 1cm thick maximum
Missed the chance to describe the hashbrowns using every noun and verb variation of "shredded".  "Shred them using the shredding side of your box shredder."
y'all kidding me with the sponsor, bro
Antisemitic sponsorship :(
it is just so funny to me that a simple video game has people THIS upset, lol
disappointed to see you taking a sponsorship that supports the terf JKR
Tomato's wouldn't be just added to the plate as fresh, they'd usually be grilled/cooked and bubble and squeak would be hash browns. Funny you did that for the American breakfast but not the British one.  That's about it though really, mostly on point.
fried bread is the best!
Hey mister Babish?   I got a request, think you could make some of the food from Team Fortress 2?   Like the Sandwich that Heavy Weapons eats.
very sad abt the sponsor, the game about stopping an uprising of very obvious jewish caricatures, made by a man who created a LOT of antisemetic content on youtube, etc etc
Disappointing sponsor for this episode! HP is such a tarnished franchise given JK's really disgusting personal views and really not one to be celebrating and endorsing
I wont eat blood sausage/black pudding. I don't even eat rare meats. I have more than enough blood in me, I don't need to consume more.
Disappointed you took a Hogwarts Legacy sponsor.
Nope. This a bad partnership which directly benefits Rowling who is anti-trans and anti-Semitic. Unsubscribing.
BABISH, NO, DON'T TAKE THE WIZARD GAME SPONSORSHIP! BABIIIIIIIIIIIIISH!
Thank you for not attempting a British accent while narrating this. I'm sure the temptation was very difficult.
Those black pudding sausages look delicious, actually.
Babish bigot embarrassment
Immensely disappointed in Andrew for this one, and I don't mean the food (which looks delicious as always). I really believed you had higher standards, but I suppose life is full of disappointments. Unsubscribed
Hogwarts Legacy is a game that really makes you feel like an anti-Semite. You can live out all your Blood Libel dreams in it. 0/10
I guess this is how Uncle Roger feels...
Maybe it’s a regional thing but in my experience the fried egg is never flipped.  It’s fried on one side.  We don’t call it this but I believe “Sunny side up”
Waiting for the Botched By Babish where he apologizes for promoting an antisemitic game that will put money in the hands of a powerful transphobe. Nice job.
Full English doesn't have bubble and squeak. Also, unlike what other people have commented here, hash browns aren't part of it either.
quartering mushies for a cooked breakfast should net you a slap
Sucks to see you promoting the TERF game, dude, ngl.
Trans people trying their damnedest to justify all the hate they get 💯💯
The sponsorship is pretty disappointing, dude.
Cmon Babish, don't take money from people trying to commit genocide against trans people :(
Yeah babish bubble and squeak is now way part English breakfast
So you are promoting a blatantly antisemitic game. Lovely, I will be unsubscribing and cancelling my Patreon membership.
Yes, finally!
Ew
very disappointed seeing you take a sponsorship from hogwarts legacy, its been lovely being a part of this channel, but it ends here
I'm surprised and disappointed to see this channel taking this sponsorship.  I think I'm going to unsubscribe.
I want a Breakfast with Babish... (*Breakfastes with Babish?)
Disappointing sponsorship
Babish! You can't say the M-word anymore! You gotta say N.A.M.P.! Non-Activated Magic Person!
Tsk. Lot of my trans friends and I are unsubbing. Unfortunate you chose to take this brand deal.
Based with Babish
Not Babish advertising for that Terf:)
Accepting sponsorship from the TERF game is a major disappointment.  Very disheartening.
Really? Taking sponsorships from the antisemitism game which funds transphobic hate? I thought you were better than this.
Thats also an unsubscribe fer me. Trans lives are important fershitsake EW!!!
Brought to you by a terf. Ew pass. Im not even watching this if its sponsored by bullshittery.
It's all very brown, isn't it?
You need to drown the whole thing in brown sauce to be OG. Plus a massive mug of tea.
Did you really have to take money to advertise the terf game?
Bubble and squeak is for pie usually  Hashbrowns for breakfast
babish... we trusted u dude
Has it occurred to people that Babish and his team may not actually know that J K is a terf??? I mean it's not very well known outside of trans communities and most people know about Harry Potter as a franchise far more than the person who created it. Keep that in mind before being emotional and unsubscribing simply because he promoted a currently popular game
Okay, it's time someone says this. Your intro music is way too loud. It's nearly triple the volume of the rest of the video, and I had to turn my volume down by a lot just to avoid noise complaints from neighbors and jump scaring myself. It's really awful, because when you start speaking I have to turn my volume back up just so I can understand you basically whispering and mumbling softly after that speaker-blasting intro song. You already have so many subscribers, so you won't notice if a couple unsubscribe, since more viewers will subscribe back in the end. But, I really enjoy your content and would rather not completely avoid your channel just from this issue. That intro volume soured my mood though, and made me not want to watch the rest of your video. It just doesn't fit with the calm vibe of the video either. Hope you or someone assisting with your channel sees this comment and makes an adjustment.
Let's gooo, Babish getting on the TERFs side!!!
Bit disappointed in the sponsor, man. You do you, though. We can't control you, and if you really think that the game can be separated from the creator, then that's your prerogative. I just don't agree, lol.  I know there are gonna be people who are like "Ooh, look at me! I'm gonna buy a copy for every ✨️ snowflake ✨️ that comments!" and to y'all: Get over yourselves, seriously. Imagine acting like immature children over people having different feelings from you (which is what y'all say we do...interesting).
The "blood sausage" is something we eat in Poland (mostly on bbqs) and this is amazing. I REALLY loved it, but when I found out it was actually made of blood I stopped eating it for like a decade (it was when I was 10 yo). Now I really enjoy and try not to think about it ;)
I hate to say it, as I normally love your videos. But I expected better, when it comes to sponsors. Hogwarts Legacy directly benefits JK Rowling, who uses the success of her products as justification for her antisemitic and transphobic views, and the direct harm her anti-trans advocacy does to the transgender community.
Hogwarts legacy? Didn't know Babish was such a transphobe.  /s
Hogwarts legacy ad? Why?
Ahem… do we need to have words??
“I’d like to make an Americanised version”  begins to cry tears of Yorkshire tea.
there are american wizards???? lol
I've never had bubble and squeak with mashed potato. It's always made with leftover roasties and cabbage from Sunday lunch (in my house, at least).
disappointed in that sponsorship. You could do better man.
Well, it was sad to find out you're willing to take money from the game that funds transphobia. I learned a lot from you over the years.
Hey I know we had soy boys but can you do a vegan basics???
Oh well. One less cooking channel to subscribe to. At least Max Miller isn't taking TERF money.
Terry Funk: I should have taken the money... Andrew: I did take the money!
This was a really poor choice of sponsor, man. Really disappointed to see this from y'all. And before people start going on about "separating the art from the artist," Rowling is on record saying she views the continued financial success of HP as explicit support for her political views. Every dollar she makes from stuff like this is, in her eyes, another person saying she's right.
Disappointed that your video is sponsored by hogwarts legacy, thought the team knew a little better.
yiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiikes
Remember to report anyone threatening the video creator or their sponsorship with the report for harrassment of others button to the right of their comment. These kinds of vicious hate campaigns need to be stamped out through community effort.
I wish i could sort by controversial, lol.
Disappointed and sad BCU is endorsing JK Rowling. Guess I'm done being a subscriber.
I love this!
Some sponser ya got there.   Bout time to unsub.
That is a sorry excuse from a British fry up. Your research on it was severely lacking.
So glad he added Bubble and Squeak to this, Botched By Babish is my favorite series on this channel. XD
Brits eat like the Germans are still overhead
Bubble and squeak is rarely, if ever a part of a full English. You're more likely to get hash browns... If you go north, you could also get haggis on it... some would argue this to be a Full Scottish Breakfast... but semantics...
based babish
Not watching a video with this sponsor. Disappointed in you.
Hogwarts legacy is Genuinely the greatest game i ever played, cant wait till they add their first trans character  “The Warlock of 40 Percent”
*tries to portray himself as a modern progressive guy*  *sends money to JK Rowling*   🙄
I love everything
Babish team, it’s incredibly disappointing to see that you accepted a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy. Not only do profits from the game go towards someone who is proudly transphobic, the game itself is horribly antisemitic. It’s understandable that these contracts and videos are planned well in advance and it’s not very reasonable to ask that you take the video down, but the least that you could do is donate to trans and Jewish activist funds. Mistakes happen, it’s how you move forward that counts.
Boooooo, dirty money.
Loved the content, long time fan and that hasn't changed. I do feel compelled to say that I'm disappointed by the choice of sponsor for this video.
Very disappointed to see you support Hogwarts Legacy. Please read about the antisemitism written into the game by the writer, and the money that will be going to Rowling.
I am reminded again that what my mama always called hash browns in the South are what others call home fries. Great way to use up baked potatoes though. Now a full Southern Breakfast would be interesting
I gotta say, you've always seemed like a pretty progressive and inclusive guy and channel. The Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship is really depressing to see.  When you have two entire marginalized communities pleading with you to not play "Blood Libel: The Game" and stop lining the pockets of one of the most visible bigots in the western world, it's very telling of where you stand when you ignore those pleas. Today you've signaled to your Jewish fans, your trans fans, and the world that money is worth more to you than doing the right thing.
halo everyone
Hey, I love your show but I'll be honest, it's disappointing to see you partnering with Hogwarts Legacy.... I'm gonna keep watching but I hope you can make different ad choices in future. Thanks!
Where are the hash browns
Eating this with a hangover is an essential part of the breakfast.
disappointing sponsor dude :(
Hogwarts legacy?  C'mon man, either you stand with your trans friends or you don't.
Very disappointed that you took the terf money
Thanks Gov'na!
Yes, Andrew! Take the Terf money! Better in your pockets than theirs.
I'm thinking BeardMeatsFood could crush that in 2 minutes or less.
Hearing blood sausage surprised me. Black pudding is the best of the breakfast
Imagine deleting comments because you have no shame and take any sponsor who gives you the most money, disgusting
I‘m honestly just disappointed in the Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship
People getting all upset and unsubscribing about hurtfull words that someone else said need to go touch grass
Hogwarts Legacy ad? No thanks. It makes a hard pass on the video too. JK doesn’t need more money to discriminate against the trans community.
So a Full English breakfast is a Half Texas breakfast (minus the 32oz Steak of course).
Absolutely felt like a slap in the space to see you accept a sponsor for this game. Unsubscribed after +5 years.
Disappointed in your sponsorship, Babish.
Have better sponsors.
Seems fitting to me that a basics ep on anything full english or otherwise from terf island would be sponsored by the terf queen's latest money grab 🙄 That being said, food looks amazing as always
Botched By Babish on the HP stuff incoming XD
babish is now a awful person and should be canceled for taking jk rowlings money to sponser hogwarts jk
biggest mistake is that hogwarts legacy ad.
Bro...that sponsorship...read the room...
unsubscribed.
*Hogwarts Legacy Sponsor* And here come the Fanatics against the game.
I'm an old fan, all the way back from the Adventure Time Sandwich, but I can't continue being a fan of someone who'd throw me under the bus for a shill. I thought you were better than that.
Honestly rly sad about the sponsorship, a slap in the face especially for British trans and Jewish people, but also for the communities at large. Sadly, that's a huge overstepped boundary and will be an unfollow from me.
babish taking money from the TERF fund! yay!
I hope the game made by anti-Semites using the characters written by a transphobe at least paid you well for the sponsorship.
Not that one less sub will matter to you but I'm disappointed.
Uh oh 👀
Way to promote the TERF game, Andrew 👎
Maybe don't accept sponsorship from a franchise associated with a hateful bigot like JK Rowling, who actively influences harm on trans people? Just a thought
Extremely disappointed to see you accept a sponsorship for this game. Be better
Not bad. The only things I’d change are no bubble and squeak (hash browns are fine, though) and it needs brown sauce, but I dunno if you can get that over there
Sure hope the HP Twitter rage mafia doesn't find this video....
Transphobia blood libel game sponsorship? taken aback. absolutely revolting
At this point I wouldn't be surprised if Babish was sponsered by the lost city of Atlantis.
Apparently bench scraper is a term not alot of people know, at least the ones I've worked with... And I've been all over haha. All scratch kitchens, from vegan to French cuisine.... I call for a bench scrape and I get looked at like "what did he call me?" Maybe it's a Colorado thing.... Too much giggle bush out here😉😉
Hi Mr.Babish! Wow, I was watching you at the beginning of my journey of transition when I was just a kid to now. Normally I try not to fault creators, but the information about why my community is upset has been available for a while, so I won't summarize what other people are saying. I'm really hurt is all. Guess this is goodbye, it's been a real blast to be a viewer for a whole few chapters of my life.
Rather unfortunate sponsorship. I’m gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and say you probably just don’t know. Maybe I’m in denial.
Both versions are great, but I would have expected hash browns over bubble and squeak.
Oh no, he mentioned the forbidden game! Cancel babish?
Very disappointed to see an ad for this game tbh.
I appreciated everything about this except the inclusion of support of the Hogwarts game.
I'd say hash browns are more common than bubble and squeak at least where I live in the UK
Extremely embarrassing for you that you're sponsored by hogwarts legacy tbh
its ok if you got something wrong babish, brits are barely human anyways, pretty sure they just use photosynthesis.
Just to add that cooking your fried eggs over easy is also not quintessentially English. Most fried eggs here are not flipped halfway through.
Yeah. Taste of english cuisine and beauty of english women, made England a county of sailors and travelers.
Fried bread is shallow fried in vegetable oil, not just toasted buttered bread.
not a great sponsor ship choice
this episode is sponsored by Queen TERF
Bit disappointed in your choice of sponsors.
Me watching the sponsor literally made release the biggest oh no of my life
i'm dissapointed in you for taking a sponsorship from such a deeply inherently antisemitic and transphobic game supporting a massive bigot in the process i've been a fan of the channel for a very long time and this crosses a personal deeply affecting line with me. it makes me really sad to go, honestly. but you've taken their money and stated where you are in this by doing so, goodbye
Why flip the eggs noooooooooooo
The food was alright (the hash brown/bubble and squeak debacle excepted), but I'm disappointed in the choice of sponsorship
Instant dislike for promoting the terf game, disappointing
I'd definitely use Branston's instead of Heinz.
Favorite sponsored ad I’ve seen so far
Subbed for years but I have to drop now, Andrew. Can't believe you would take a sponsor like this, thought you were better than it.
Imagine taking money from J.K. ew
Disappointed in the sponsor you took man.  Maybe you guys could do a little research into where the money you get from it came from and what money spent buying the game goes towards.
Dear Americans:  Please stop calling ham Canadian bacon.  Canadians eat the same bacon as you do, and we do not call ham bacon.  There is something called peameal bacon, which is essentially back bacon like you used in the first recipe, but coated with cornmeal on the outside.  Battle moose are gearing up for war, but we can still de-escalate this.
Needs brown sauce. HP if you can find it.
Yeah, no, sorry, but this sponsor? I'm moving on from the BCU, I can't believe you'd take that.
Did you have to accept the sponsorship of the transphobic wizard game?
Two major types of comments: Angry Brits because yanks can never get the dish right and "angry" (pretending to be angry) straight white twitter users who want some sweet sweet internet points
"bubble and squeak" "bangers" england isnt a real place
I hope you don't get a slue of hate for your sponsor.
For the record, Irish breakfasts will usually have white pudding in place of black, and potato farls or soda bread. Scots breakfast should also include haggis, and ideally Ayrshire bacon, which makes the Scottish variant the very best.
Dang, the background music was unbelievably annoying. Otherwise, nice as always.
Disappointing to see you advertise the wizard game. Very poor choice.
People are rightly saying about hash browns instead of bubble and squeak. The more old-fashioned option might be fried slices of potato, but idk how many people do that now
This is a really disappointing sponsorship, BCU. I've been following this channel for years at this point and I didn't expect this lack of care in a sponsorship you'd take.
Disappointed in the Bubble and Squeak for breakfast. It is NOT a breakfast item 😂 it's left overs form a Sunday Roast
Can’t support this video if it’s sponsored by that anti-Semitic, terf, trash. I thought you were better than this Babish.
I'm hungry now
Flipping eggs over on a full English isn’t something I’ve seen before either
I have a hard time imagining that any British person was consulted for this video if you're adding bubble and squeak to a full english. Wouldn't complain if bubble and squeak was on my plate, but it's definitely not something I've ever seen in a full breakfast.
This breakfast looks almost as delicious as the fact that professor fig dies in every possible ending of hogwarts legacy.
HUGE disappointment to see you partnering with an antisemetic, racist, and transphobic game.
Nice try but not quite right. Never seen bubble an squeak in full English anywhere her in uk but hash browns alllllll the way👍 and always big half cut tomato’s
why are you taking sponsorship from the TERF game? unsubscribing, as much as it pains me.
Bubble and squeak has no business being on that plate. That has never been part of any British breakfast I've ever had in my 55 years living here.
And I thought I just had a great breakfast by making a bacon and egg salad wrap. To quote my favorite line from When Harry Met Sally: I'll have what he's having! (Yes, I know it's what SHE'S HAVING, but it had to fit the video)
extremely sad that you accepted this sponsorship.
as a British person myself - i approve
come on, man, hogwarts legacy? You're better than associating yourself with that kind of content.
Gross sponsorship choice.
As a Brit…f that promotion
Don't bother with the tomato's there aren't any at the moment
Whenever I see these armchair activists losing their minds over beliefs they don’t actually hold, I think about Silvervale crying in happiness from getting her wand. None of you will ever know that kind of joy.
Very disappointed that you chose to take this sponsorship.
Spot on except for the bubble and squeak (we normally have hash browns) and the tomatoes (should be a big tomato halved). Pretty authentic though and looks delicious.
a series on full  breakfasts from around the world and how to make them would be really inch resting :)
Boo to the Harry Potter sponsor
ew hogwarts legacy  binging with babish becomes cringing with babish
Next up, Scottish variation with tattie scones, lorne sausage and haggis ❤
did you for real take a sponsorship for this??
taking money from the game that must not be named, hope you're ready to get cyber bullied my guy
Heinz are way overrated and are so watery now. Even supermarket own brand is better now and cheaper!
Haha! Watching an American cooking an English dish is always fun but you nailed it. Personally I tried black pudding, loved the taste, hated the texture and I love my bacon almost cremated and nice and crispy but looks like a 9/10. 😋
bubble's everywhere.
Not bad, 2 points to make as a brit.. we do not flip our eggs, always sunny side up and we only call them bangers when we have them with mash... hence bangers and mash.
I've been a fan for a long time, but I have to admit that I'm pretty disappointed in you guys for taking this particular sponsorship.
Please stop your ad deal for Hogwarts Legacy. You are supporting JK Rowling's anti trans hate.
Bubble and squeak is more like a very nice extra. Not a staple part
Bimish with Bambis
Bit disappointed that Babish is taking money to advertise Blood Libel: the Game.
Awful choice of sponsorship choice aside and it is a choice you’ve made. In the uk we’d do the fried toast in oil not butter, hash browns not bubble and squeak and we’d also have normal toast the majority of the time.
So Hogwarts Legacy hasn't sodded off yet, then? Hopefully your next video will be sponsored by something that isn't funding anti transgender hate. Very disappointed.
i love BCU and usually these videos are such a comfort for me but when i opened this video and the first thing i saw was the WB sponsor my heart sank. as a trans viewer, it really makes it somewhat difficult to watch because whether BCU knew beforehand or not, it’s not that hard to find if you look into the sponsors values. it’s always a horrible moment when you can’t feel fully welcome by a creator you normally enjoy so much
Downvoted for WB Harry Potter Legacy. Net worth 8 million means you can choose better.
Fancy tomatoes would never be on a proper fry up. It’s half of one big round tomato. Your B&S also needs to be almost grey tinged. Plus HP sauce.
Tomatoes on the vine? Dude, there are millions of British people...any one of whom could tell you that isn't traditional... maybe half a normal tomato, grilled (that's broiled for your people) if you were lucky, and by lucky I mean posh. Furthermore, bangers are only bangers when there's mash involved, and whoever told you that bubble and squeak was a thing with a full English needs to retake their citizenship test.  My wife is American, and she was also horrified. In her words "who's this c**t"?
Guess you could call the second one the Full Colonial breakfast
Why did you sell out to the HP people of all IPs, did you need the money so badly you had to sell your code of ethics?
Why are the majority of people commenting their ‘disappointment’ in regards to the sponsor pretending like they aren’t here simply for the cause and outrage? A majority of them have never commented on a Babish video before, use copy and paste key words, and perhaps unsubscribed but far more likely we’re just never subscribed to begin with.. It’s pathetic to pretend to be some sort of hurt and disappointed fan when you’re an annoyed visitor at best.
Bubble and squeak is normally left over roast dinner
I'm disappointed in you, Babish, I guess sponsorship money is more important than trans lives.
Sad to see an ad for Hogwarts Legacy on this channel :/ I understand that you need to make money to afford to keep making videos and you may not always get a choice about sponsors. And I understand that for an English breakfast episode you might want a sponsor that has some connection to the material. But it still makes me sad to see that you're advertising a game whose profits will go to anti-trans causes. I hope you can choose not to in future.
As a trans person and fan of the show I must say I'm very disappointed that you chose to be sponsored by and promoting things linked to known hate monger Rowling. Just... Be better.
Ew not endorsing a game that lines the pocket of a transphobe. Love you but no.
What?? Hogwarts sponsor? Absolutely not watching this. I’m incredibly ashamed. Alienate all your trans watchers why don’t you
I'm here for the botched by babish prequel
Now they need to add Harry Potter to Multiversus as a ranged fighter.
im a little dissapointed about the sponser considering the antisemetic issues that are in the hogwarts game but idk if they would now so uh
should've used the sausage as a breakwater
bubble and squeak normally has a few more veg in. What you've basically made there is tattie scones- still nice tho
i wondered what the dislikes were for, since mostly its a nice video. but then i see the hogwarts legacy stuff. i wont lie, this is quite disappointing.
I am from England and I've never seen bubble and squeak in a full English
Uh oh, here come the Twitter "heroes"
yo why are you sponsored by that Harry Potter game that's super antisemitic? isn't JK Rowling's transphobia enough?
Love the video! Although I am a bit sad to see all the hate you're getting in the comments for accepting a sponsorship. It's interesting to me to see people argue that hatred for a single person's point of view should outweigh the overwhelming amount of love that has spawned from the Harry Potter franchise. I'm not a huge potter head myself. I didn't purchase the game, didn't have any interest in it but, then again it doesn't seem JK Rowling had much interest in it either beyond her royalty check. Personally, I don't like the implication that you can't take something negative and turn it into a positive and use it in order to start to heal a deep cut wound.
I understand you have to take whichever sponsorship you can get to keep the show going, but the wizard game has so many issues. I hope you guys can find a different sponsor soon.
Bubble and squeak is definitely not part of a full english! just hash browns
Black pudding is simply the best.
Nice sponsor, troons seething
Homie, that is not Canadian bacon
Nah not the hogwarts legacy sponsorship 😞
Gotta give you a thumbs down on this one, purely because of the sponsor
I'm disappointed that Babish is advertising the anti-Semitic wizard game.
Hogwarts Legacy 🤨
Being from England, Bubble and Squeak is usually made from left-overs from a Sunday dinner (or Sunday roast) so you don’t usually get it on a full English however wouldn’t be bothered if it showed up on the plate, we’d still eat it all 😂
"as authentic as possible"...  No, no, no.
I'm wondering if all the dislikes are from the hogwarts legacy sponsor or from something done wrong with the food. Probably the former.
That sponsor choice made my heart sink :(
No, just no......
I’ve never before turned off a Babish video because of a sponsor. Sadly that streak is now broken.
As a longtime fan, it makes me very sad to see you taking a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy.
lowkey disappointed you're promoting the new harry potter game
Oooh...not the best move, Babish.
Saw the title and knew that I was going to enjoy this
Kinda missing the point of of bubble and squeek making it from scratch. It's always made with leftovers from a roast.  Also Hogwarts Legacy? Eww.
I was really excited for this episode until I saw the ad at the beginning. Honestly pretty surprised and disappointed you took a sponsor for HP anything. I was under the impression you would have more moral fiber than to take TERF money.
Would accepting a sponsorship from a game that not only takes place in a fantasy world created by the most famous TERF on the planet, not only has a plot centered around blood libel and other antisemitic propaganda, but also plays like absolute garbage and installs a glaring security flaw on your system count as a Botched? Because frankly I’m incredibly disappointed in you for this one, Andrew. I could deal with dishes from Harry Potter getting videos because I know it’s hard for some people to let go of their nostalgia from before JKR proved to be such a menace, but to directly plug a game that’s blatant hate speech and funds an author with a spoken, vested interest in eliminating trans people is far too much for me. Please research your would-be sponsors before accepting them, and consider apologizing to your trans and Jewish fans for this one, because you’ve just broken the trust of a LOT of people.
sponsor sucks, get it together babish!
For those wondering about the inclusion of bubble and squeak over hash browns in the first dish... I'm pretty sure it was done that way to avoid including the exact same item in both dishes, and since hash browns are more closely associated with America, they ended up in the Americanised version instead.  And for what it's worth, while rare these days, it was far more common to get bubble and squeak in the past... most people are just less likely to have leftovers suitable to make it these days (except after things like Christmas).
episode sponsored by transphobia
Holographic meatloaf from spongebob
I know you have to make your money where you can, but it’s disappointing to see that you’ve decided to promote a game built on some of the most ancient and harmful antisemitic conspiracy theories, whose lead designer vocally supports antifeminist movements like Gamergate, and whose royalties go directly to transphobic organizations (as Rowling herself has said). Antisemitism is back on the rise and this game is directly involved in making being Jewish more dangerous; it’s upsetting to see the work of a culinary team I admire tarnished by taking money from Blood Libel: The Game.
That's ham, not real Canadian peameal bacon, sport? You A) should know better? B) need to go to Whitehouse Meats upstairs in the St. Lawrence Farmers Market in Toronto to get the real thing. Which one is the Bubble and which the Squeak, O' Babish who sold his soul three times for an ad for a children's game? Dissed.
pretty disappointed you took this sponsor :/
Now chop it into little pieces, mix it up in a big bowl with tomato sauce, thats what I use to have, we called it "muck in a bowl"
Sneaking in the Hogwarts Legacy promo was badly done, Andrew. Poor form. I would've  just lived with the disagreement if you had at least been upfront with it but this halfway nonsense is honestly just such a dishonest corporate move that I am unsubscribing.
I see no volrath's shapeshifter in this deck tech.
Babish, I'm really disappointed that you are partnering with hogwarts legacy. The game itself is antisemitic, with the funds going to a transphobe who lobbies parliament for anti trans laws. I personally find this to be a big enough offense to unsubscribe, and I don't believe I will be doing so alone.
Now a full Scottish to see what breakfast should be
Never once have i seen bubble and squeak served with a full english. You dont always get potatoes with it and if you do your much more likely to see hash browns, even if its not traditional.
Very disappointed in your sponsor choice..... Please do better for your community.
It's kind of disheartening seeing someone grow as a person to then accept money from warner bross and  That Old Lady that shall not be named.
why promote a game that funds a TERF not cool dude. Thumbs down.
Why is no one boycotting the Lego sets, the Wizarding World theme parks, or any other of a hundred different avenues of revenue for JK? Because it’s not the hot topic trending on Twitter and this is the path of least resistance; posting a comment on a YouTube video and unsubbing. Y’all are wild.
i usually quite like my english breakfast with figs, which quite reminds me of how professor eleazar fig unavoidably dies at the end of hogwarts legacy and how anne was cursed by rookwood, who framed the goblins
really disappointed you would take a sponsorship from something so antisemitic that lines the pockets of someone so transphobic. do better
how about full Irish?
disappointed about the sponsor. i love the videos from the babish channel, but im very disheartened to see you guys supporting a game so rooted in transphobic, homophobic, and antisemitic views. i implore you all to look closer into what you accept sponsorships from. i grew up with harry potter and it sparked a huge interest in magic in me, but its riddled with and rooted in these bigoted mindsets. the channel supporting the new game contributes to the suppression of LGBTQ and jewish people, as rowling is getting money from sales and it is going directly to anti-LGBTQ and antisemitic originations.
Taking money from TERFs is a bad look.
Literally yelling “NOOOOOOOO” at my screen at the sponsor 😭 Guys. Please. Ugh
Fully ready to have a bunch of people dog pile about how sensitive I am, so I won't be looking at any replies to this but it needs to be said.  Considering the wide and diverse audience this channel has, it's extremely disappointing to see sponsorship by an ip created by someone who openly calls for the annihilation of trans people. Say what you will about the author's lack of involvement in the project, but the influence she has and the royalties she receives go directly to harming an entire demographic. I've been a fan of the babish culinary universe for a while, so to come to this video and see this kind of support for someone who calls for the eradication of people I care about--whether or not andrew or the channel as a whole agree with her--is both disappointing and hurtful.
SMH Hogshit Legacy
I'm disappointed this channel would associate itself with Hogwarts Legacy. I understand channels have to make money through sponsorship deals but the fact that this channel would choose to attach it's name to a game with such heavy antisemetic themes whose money is going to a woman who is directly funding the oppression of trans people in the UK is disheartening. If you have trans people or Jewish people in your life, I am sure you have heard about this issue and it is disappointing to know that you would ignore the concern of those people in your life. If you don't have trans or Jewish people in your life, maybe I was always mistaken about how accepting this channel was.  For those not sure what I'm talking about, I don't think I can post outside links in YouTube comments, but Polygon does have an article that gives an overview of the controversy. The antisemetism is more glossed over but the article does mention the original lead developer's far right views.
Disappointed that you'd accept money from transphobes, Babish.  Unsubscribing.
Not authentic, you actually seasoned it
Not me playing hogwarts legacy while watching this video....
Having experienced British breakfast sausage, I would agree - it's superior to American breakfast sausage. And I *love* American breakfast sausage.
why would you promote a terf game, babish, why
glad to see you use real bacon in this video... i think there would have been war if you had used any other
Couple of things as most other British people are saying:   Bubble and squeak isn't a breakfast thing, it should be has browns, I've never heard anyone use Bubble and Squeak in a full English at all, We don't call Sausages "Bangers" typically unless it's for "Bangers and Mash", Flipping eggs isn't really a thing for a full English,   Otherwise props for using back bacon and black pudding, but I can physically hear all the other Brits cringing from those few things^
Honestly, boo for taking money to promote the terf game.
Here in Britain your second plating was closer to our typical breakfast. Like literally how we eat it over here.
Transphobic sponsor is transphobic
eggs should have been sunny side up
That sponsor...  Babish... No...
Really disappointed to find you using your channel to promote an antisemitic game that benefits a transphobic billionaire.
This looks lovely. Great game btw. It's nice to see it had a successful launch. Bought copies for my friends too!
Please don't accept sponsorships from Hogwarts Legacy. It's a transphobic, anti-Semitic game made by people who are actively, vocally, proudly transphobic and anti-Semitic.
I don't want to unsub from one of my favorite YouTube channels but I hate being reminded people don't care Abt trans and Jewish people and want people like us dead
There's not enough oil on that plate.

Weird choice of sponsor
Babish I really hope you backpedal on the sponsorship. I know money is needed but this isnt the way to go. I'm gonna give it time but if no effort is made I'm unsubbing
I understand that you need to get money where you can, but it's upsetting to see you supporting an antisemitic game that supports the queen terf.
Andrew, I've been a big fan of yours for years now, and was so looking forward to a video about the great full English. But I can't fully express my disappointment that you would let yourself be sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy when JK Rowling's transphobia has been on display for quite some time now. This is a slap in the face to your trans and allied audience. I can only hope this was done in ignorance somehow instead of because of any attitudes of your own toward trans people.
I would have loved to share this, but given the number of trans friends I have, I feel that the sponsor is not something I can promote. Sorry.
Why is everyone being so soft and disliking?
Day 42 of asking Alvin to make the tank cakes from Girls und Panzer!
Aaaand unsubbing bc of the advertisement of a Terf game
So close, yet so far..  A whole vine of cherry tomatoes? This is a meal for people in high-vis jackets, not for people who can’t decide between this and avocado toast. One tomato sliced in half and seared on the inside.  I’ve never seen bubble & squeak on a breakfast, but I guess this isn’t so bad because it’s also not bubble & squeak.  Why would you flip an egg for a breakfast? What are you going to dip your toast in?  Lastly, the lack of HP sauce is bordering on a war crime..
Imagine being upset over a video game 😂  Great video Babish 👍
WARNING!!! POTENTIAL SPOILERS FOR HOGWARTS LEGACY BELOW!!!
You took sponsorship from Hogwarts Legends... Seriously? Dude...
Bubble and Squeak may be a proper bri'ish dish but it isn't part of a full english. Also bangers aren't sausages, the reason they are called bangers is that they don't have enough meat to legally be called a sausage.
Disappointed that you’d willingly take a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy.
WARNING!!! POTENTIAL SPOILERS FOR HOGWARTS LEGACY BELOW!!!!!!!!!!!!
shame on you for accepting a Hogwarts legacy sponsorship.
Snowflake Clowns disliking because of the hogwarts legacy sponsor
Really disappointed you took this sponsorship. Followed the channel for a long time, but I'll be unsubscribing now; really wish you hadn't done this
Not sure where the bubble and squeak comes from 🤣
oh man I can almost smell it.  Intermittent fasting sucks.
Your teacher, Professor Eleazar Fig, dies at the end of Howarts Legacy. This cannot be avoided or changed in any ending. Anne was cursed by Rookwood, who framed the goblins. Now you don’t have to play this anti-Semitic game or give money to JRK, who has publicly said she’d donate the royalties she gets from every sale to anti-trans organizations
well, time to unsub from babish
WARNING!!!!! Potential Hogwarts Legacy Spoilers Below!!!
BABISH - you should know better than taking sponsorship from transphobia, antisemite, JKR or any of her related products. <3 I ain't mad, I'm just disappointed.
I'd say the only inaccuracies are the bubble and squeak being it's own separate thing and not part of a full english, and also the eggs are traditionally scrambled
I understand you have to make money, but I'm very disappointed that you would take money from something that funds a person that actively uses their platform to harm others.
I'm English and have never had bubble and squeak in a breakfast and flipping eggs is strictly an American thing you would get that lot sent back if you served it in the UK
Well there's one for Botched with Babish, you don't have Bubble amd Squeak with a Full English, usually it's hash browns
What's up with everyone doing full English this last few weeks? Haha not that I'm complaining but it seems like everyone decided to it at once
Yikes
As an Englishmen I get rather annoyed when people make bubble and squeak for the full English breakfast. Bubble and squeak is quite literally the left over potatoes, cabbage and protein from the Sunday dinner fried up and is thus a dish itself, not part of the English breakfast.
Don’t think I’ve ever seen bubble & squeak on a full English. Not saying I wouldn’t eat it but not seen it before
Bubble and squeak is for the left over veg from the Sunday roast, with fried egg
Great effort, actually getting the right bacon and sausages! Definitely more likely to see hash browns rather than bubble and squeak but still, as an Englishman this passes my test!
can't believe he's shilling for Potterverse
I have never once seen bubble and squeak in a full english, always hash browns
would love to see a full turkish breakfast!
Wow at least the gaming streamers who took to this had the excuse of being in the field the transphobe wizard game was released in. You're a cooking channel that didn't have to touch this in any way, but mmmm tasty tasty money I guess. Thanks for helping in the continued profiting of the figurehead of a genocidal anti-lgbt hate movement.
Hogwarts Legacy Boycott failed losers remember that :)
Very disappointed in this tie in. Been following for years but actively promoting this when I'm sure you're aware of whose involved is turning me away.
I'm english, and I approve this breakfast. Except for bubble and squeak, that's a different breakfast altogether. Fried potatoes or hash browns are way more common
Love a full english
Comment section is just foaming at the mouth, excited to tell babish “well actually this one part of the meal is wrong” when he doesn’t even live in the UK and probably did a fair share of research before making the dish
Mate, we have hash browns not bubble and squeak for brekkie!
Bubble and squeak? On a full English? Don't know what your source is, but I've never seen bubble and squeak on a Full English in my life. We use those triangular hash browns you mentioned.  From my knowledge as a Brit, it's almost a cardinal sin to make bubble and squeak from anything but roast dinner leftovers.
As a Canadian... You basically had "Canadian bacon" earlier with the british meal, then you grabbed ham and called it Canadian bacon.
That Hogwarts sponsor must have made you lose a few subscribers, but glad you arent caring about the triggered losers.
Not a full English breakfast without a cuppa tea
that's a pretty bad sponsor.
You should have asked BeardMeatsFood to eat this after you made it. He's eaten every other full English Breakfast made in the western hemisphere, wouldn't want to miss one! lol
Maybe total worldwide destruction is needed. A reset of this toxic self-righteous "civilization." I am curious if the sjws of the world know that every time they pick a hill to die on, it drives a moderate civil person deeper into what they would call 'the enemy' camp.
You’re asking for trouble with that sponsor Andy, hopefully your audience is rational
do not accept the Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship.
...huh...this is disappointing
Extremely disappointed in the sponsor choice. I hope they paid you well enough to balance out the social implications... /s
Love this sponsorship.
Reminder that the boycott failed and Hogwarts Legacy broke sales records.
Worst sponsor yet...  Ugh... Why does this keep popping up
uh oh
Hope nobody harasses you over being sponsored by Hogwarts legacy.
Disappointing to see the BCU being sponsored by a raging anti-trans activist :/
Saw the Hogwarts ad and immediatly disliked and stopped watchign the video.
Bit of a distasteful sponsorship, but otherwise a great video as usual 😊 I _love_ black/blood pudding. Never been a big fan of fried bread, bit too oily for me, and the texture of hash browns put me off, otherwise these are the most delicious looking full breakfasts I’ve seen.
Yikes.
A Hero died today
"bubble and squeak" do yall brits hear urselves????? that cannot possibly be real
Very disappointing to see you accept a sponsorship from the anti-Semitism and transphobia wizard game.
So... Another person who has either no internet awareness or for who sponsor money is more important than people's lives and their safety.  WIll you also do one with blood money from Atomic Hearts?
Hey you get to do a video for hitting 10 million subs again! Heres hoping you hit 9 mil soon
Bubble and squeak is not traditional unless prof fig dies in every possible ending and rookwood cursed anne and blamed the goblins.
Really disappointed that Babish accepted a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy, given the game's anti-semitic themes and a cut of the profits going to a virulently transphobic person, who uses that money to lobby for transphobic laws and policies. I would hope Babish would be more discerning.
Very upset no homemade black pudding was made
That is not a Full English. Source - am English.
The food looks great! But super disappointed with the sponsor choice. I really expected better
Babish's allyship vanishing from his body when approached with a sponsor offer by warner bros
Hogwarts school of transphobia sponsorship really turned me off.
booo JKR get a better sponsor
I've literally never seen bubble and squeak on a full English. It's delicious and I'd probably prefer it, but hash browns are the staple over here
Hugely disappointing to see you affiliated with this. Unsubscribed.
honestly, it's a real shame to see you accepting sponsorships from hogwarts legacy.  I'll admit I haven't been closely following your channel for a while, but seeing you accept sponsorship money from such a hateful game and media property has me certain that I'm never coming back.
Wow. BCU took money from Rowling. Disappointing, to say the least.
Do you really need to take a bigot's money? Really? Unsubscribed, needless to say
WARNING Potential Hogwarts Legacy Spoilers below
well, im unsubscribed. dont support a transphobe next time, maybe.
Babish. Babish why. Why would you accept their sponsorship. All the awful information is literally ONE GOOGLE SEARCH away. Do better
There I was, excited to watch a new Babish video when I was immediately hit by the TERF endorsement.
Would be so sick if you could not take sponsorship money from the game based on a transphobe’s IP
:'D Plain American bread for health.
Canadian here - what's canadian bacon? I always thought it was just peameal bacon, but those rounds don't look like anything I'm familiar with.
This video Made Me Hungry while I already Eating 🤣. American wizards call their muggles no-majs. And I'm gonna also throw my oar in with the bubble&squeak  / hashbrown boat.
bubble and squeak is not part of a traditional full english dude. bubble and squeak is what used to be made after a roast with leftover roast potatos and cabbage
"Sponsored by Hogwarts-" SKIP! :')
Errrrrrr where's the fucken brown sauce?!?
I would have been disappointed by the Hogwarts Legacy sponsor, but considering Babish has shilled for bitcoin wallets before, this is no massive surprise. Still, I would like you to consider the affects of your support of the transphobic, racist, anti-Semitic nightmare clown will have on you hundreds of diverse fans
quite disappointed in the JK Rowling endorsement, guess i'll be goin elsewhere
"Canadian Bacon" is a phrase only used in America. Canadians call it back bacon or (if there's a coating of peameal around the edges) peameal bacon.
Disappointing.
you people are crazy, im 99.9% sure he isnt even aware of the controversy. babish isnt transphobic so why bother him?? if he knew he wouldnt have picked up the sponsor
Why are Brits so unbelevably bad at nicknaming things? Seriously?
Well that's the most disappointing sponsor
The only thing that isn't really a thing here on a full English like everyone else is saying is the bubble and squeak  It's not a common food in general, especially not on a full English, we would have triangle hash browns in their place  The eggs would simply be fried, there would commonly be toast or fried bread, and then the tomato's are usually fried a little too
Nah, I like Rea but I'm not watching anything Hogwarts sponsored
Awesome food! I think I’ll make a trip to the international market!   Umm I hope you don’t get to many hateful comments over your sponsor
:( disappointed with the sponsor. sad youd support this game.
Babish you are close with it but still far give me a call will run down what u need to make a full English breakfast
Shouldn't let bigot fundraisers sponsor your content.
Day 63 of petitioning Babish to make the Triple Fried Egg Sandwich with Chilli Sauce and Chutney from Red Dwarf
Really disappointed that you would say yes to a sponsorship from this game. Rowling's anti-trans stance is undeniable at this point and you're helping to further that cause.
Wasn't expecting Andy to sell out for genocidal transphobe JK Rowling, that sucks.
Oh Babish honey no...really...sponsoring that awful transphobic garbage game...I'm really disappointed you just did that...
Wondering if you could talk about how you take care of your butcher block countertops? Are they sealed with something food safe? How do you keep the wood from warping? How do you sanitize without damaging them?
anyone else bothered by the sponsor or is it just me? idk i feel we should be over r*wling and her awful prejudices by now
literally why would you accept a hogwarts legacy sponsorship thats so disappointing
Yo, not a fan of this sponsor. Sorry, babs
Not wild about that sponsorship. :/ Skipping this episode.
came to the comments to see the angry mob seething about "muh wizard game bad"
Food, sponsored by Hogwarts Babishy
WARNING!!! Potential spoilers for Hogwarts Legacy below
Hogwarts Legacy is incredibly antisemitic, down to the very plot of the game, and buying it financially supports a transphobe. Please vet your sponsorships more critically in the future :(
Made Mr sad that he took up a sponsorship with HL
Awesome sponsor segment the game is fantastic and more people should buy it to support everyone in developing the game.
Full English breakfasts are awesome to eat when you're hungover. Keep in mind, the beauty of this breakfast is that you can customise it any way you want. You can drop the mushrooms, (if you're that crazy) drop the black puddings, use scrambled eggs, use beef tomatoes or chopped tomatoes from a tin. And contrary to what you might believe, you don't need a big cast iron flat top, it can all be done on regular sized frying pan. In fact some pans are designed specifically for full english breakfasts over here. Also, hash browns are way more popular than bubble and squeaks, and a glass of orange juice is a perfect drink to compliment the saltiness of this meal.
Hey I peel my potatoes like that!
I hope you got big bucks for this. Not only is the game actual dogshit, but so is the person profiting from it.
Very impressed that you took this sponsorship
Back ground music too loud
I'm probably going to be flamed for this, and I love BwB so much, but I'm super disappointed that he's hocking for Hogwarts Legacy...  JKR is the worst and absolutely should not get any of your money.
Watch out for Hogwarts Legacy spoilers below
Pretty disappointed in you Babs. The Hogwarts legacy thing isn't really something seen very positively.
Dunno where you got your info from but bubble and squeak isn't part of a full English
jk rowling is super transphobic DONT PLAY HOGWORTS LAGACY!
As a British man who has had full english's from all over our fair land, i have to say i have literally NEVER even heard of people including Bubble & Squeek in a full english. Is this like that thing where Japanese are convinced that Americans all eat KFC for Christmas dinner?
Really disappointed in the ad read :(
Really sucks that you guys took that sponsorship. :/ There are way better sponsors out there.
I’m so disappointed man, why are you taking money from someone who supports robbing trans people of their humanity? Unsubscribing, so long and thanks for all the fish. ✌🏻🏳️‍⚧️
It saddens me a bit to see you advertise for Hogwarts legacy. While there are many people in the creation of the game who do not hold these beliefs, the main creator does. She benefits financially, but also benefits from a sense of validation that her bigotry and discrimination are correct. She is the most visible transphobe in the world, and when we continue to support her we tell her that it’s ok to discriminate, and we tell trans people that they don’t belong. It feels like every time we buy or promote this game or any merchandise that it is just a drop in the ocean, but as a wise wizard said “I found it is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay… small acts of kindness and love.” If that is true then would not the opposite be true as well. I ask only that you consider how our choices add up to effect a group already so vulnerable.
we have blood pancakes i think thats the closest comparision, they are very very tasty :)     but when talking internationally people look at you with disgust :D
Your teacher dies at the end no matter what ending you get. Also, the goblins were framed by Rockwood who also cursed Anne.
Bruh please do chhole bhature
Really? A promo for THAT? Not ok.
"Im very dissapointed for Babish to take money from a TERF. Im going to harass him from my device made with coltan and children labour, because im right and everybody else is evil"
No bullying the man over taking a sponsorship you hear?
I wish I could buy an English Breakfast in America. I know this video shows me how, but I would love that comfy experience, especially if I were eating it in a pub.
Loving the outrage from the terminally online
English breakfast right after ordinary sausage does it. Coincidence? I think maybe.
How long ago did they make this video, and how much did WB pay for the sponsorship? Surely the team was aware of the controversy surrounding the game before they uploaded it.
twitter hoes mad
"Canadian bacon" is not Canadian in origin. It's a funny nickname north-eastern Americans gave to the worst variety of bacon. Typical bacon here in Canada looks exactly like the thin strips of cured fatty meat you'd expect.
🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Uhhhhh bubble and squeak does not belong with a full monty?! Hash browns is what you need and what you would get if you were to order it.
Really loving the transphobia tie in! Great stuff, very aware
Not cool being sponsored by a straight up metaphor for blood libel. Yikes dude.
im sure my comment will be lost, ignored, whatever, but i have to say something. ANDREW. im sure you must have plenty of other sponsors to pick and choose from, so why did you have to go with the anti-semetic, transphobic author game? I'm not going to rant because if youre online, you know whats going on. be better. whether the babish channel has other sponsors or not isnt even the point.
We eat hash browns a lot more than we do bubble and squeak especially with a full English
Hey babish you seemed to miss the Dodi sauce! At least the repacked one is worth it! Anyways looking foward to play Hogwarts legacy  😄
That ain’t fried bread
My 2 cents Babbish shouldn't have done Canadian Bacon, should have went with Pork Roll and Scrapple as a comparison for the Blood Sausage.
Super disappointed about the sponsorship. There's been so much discourse that there's no way to claim ignorance of the issues. Especially when it behooves a creator to research a sponsorship before acceptance.
I realize I'm going to get eviscerated by all the HP fans, but I just wanted to say how disappointed I am that you took money from the transphobe game to do this video.
That isn't that authentic I'm not gonna lie.  Bubble and squeak is very British, but hash browns are much more common and I've never seen tomatoes being done on the vine, usually they are cut in half and seared
We only have bubble and squeak if there was a Sunday roast the day before, and we usually have the eggs sunny side up, but the rest was on point.
Love the channel, but you should've used pork roll instead of Canadian bacon to keep it full "American"
I love you mr babish sir your such a great guy
Donate the money from the sponsorship to the Trans Defense Fund LA
LOL hogwartz legacy
Bubble and squeak is the Monday breakfast with your leftovers from the full English and the roast you have the Sunday previous, it's a leftovers food, prepping potatoes specifically for it is unheard of! much less including it in the full English
You forgot the HP brown sauce.
The video was an aside to the comments section on this occasion as I know the discussion that is usually sparked when one of our friends across the pond attempts a British favourite. Quite disappointed then, that apart from the obvious (and much commented on) bubble and squeak faux pax and conpletely against the grain on videos of this ilk, you've absolutely nailed it! Where did you find that we have bubble and squeak with our full English? Seriously interested.
The tomato's on the first one are completely wrong
so you're shilling for the antisemitic terf game now? really?
Terrible sponsor to have, but aight. Thankfully SponserBlock exists.
Bubble & Squeak is not a 'Full English' component Also  rare for anybody to flip an egg
Fried bread is deep fried.
My dude. Supporting JK is really dubious.
A full English without hash browns??
I'm really disappointed that you guys took Hogwarts Legacy as a sponsor. I'm unsubscribing because if you support transphobia (which is your right, i guess) then i cannot support you (which is mine)
wizard book lady bad REEE - NPC323332
Time for another Botched with Babish over this potato debacle
Ooh, sorry, getting a thumbs down from me for being sponsored by the antisemitic game that funds transphobic legislation. Really sad.
0:31 Full English Breakfast (Traditional) 4:02 Full English Breakfast (Simplified)
We don't call that Canadian Bacon in Canada, those are slices of ham. What we call Canadian Bacon is also know as Peameal Bacon and is similar to the back bacon in the 1st. Canadians are still shocked when travelling to the US, seeing Canadian Bacon on a menu and getting ham.
3:45 if i ate that for breakfast, i think id pass back out immediately after lol
Maybe it's the covid speaking, but everything on that plate, outside of the tomatoes, looks absolutely disgusting.
Honestly, the first plate looks disgusting for breakfast. But maybe that's just how English breakfast works.
I wonder where all the dislikes come from
Very disappointed you took this sponsorship :(
Wow. Actually advertising HP 🙄
This is torture...😭 I've just started meat free for lent this week and I'm craving a full English fry-up🤤 ...38 days and counting
Not Babish being sponsored by the Antisemitism Game :(
I can feel a 'Botched by Babish' coming...
an american breakfast is just the all star special. I do hash browns instead of grits in my all star.
Watch out for Hogwarts Legacy spoilers in comments folks
>Make an entire video promoting anti-trans media Incredibly based.
Had a full english breakfast on Islay the day after sampling a bunch of scotch.  Was one of the best parts of my trip to Scotland
Born, bred and live in England. Any place serving a "Full English", won't include bubble and squeak.  Maybe a hash brown, but definitely not bubble and squeak. Its definitely part of the English repertoire, but not authentic  for a full breakfast.  The tomatoes would be tinned plum tomatoes more commonly. If using fresh tomato, then its usually one half of a slicer  that's been grilled (broiled).  The bacon is usually cooked a little more crispy too. Black pudding is usually only seen on a "Full Scottish", not the English version. Our fried eggs are only cooked on one side.
Taking terf money means you lost a subscriber.  No thanks
I’m sorry, but I have to say this - I dislike very much the fact that Andrew allowed Hogwarts Legacy to sponsor this episode. No one should support Rowling and her TERF ideas.
Et tu, Babish? Et tu? 😔
Pretty disappointed in your choice of sponsor, given J. K. Rowling's rampant transphobia.
Activist fools in comments trying to spoil Hogwarts Legacy just a heads up
we always had bubble and squeek made with leftover potatos/mash and vegetables from the previous days meal, so it always had colour to it (green cabbage and brocilli for example), if we had it for breakfast it was usually with a fried egg on top.
Based vid, it earned my sub
Nice
Thank you Warner Bro's. I guess monetization of a Youtube channel with over 10 million subscribers doesn't pay the bills any more.
Very disappointed to see you taking a sponsorship from a franchise owned by an outright transphobe.
Considering the situation surrounding Hogwarts Legacy, you're very brave for accepting this sponsorship.
Bubble and squeak is traditional, but hash browns are more common
Unsubbed for the sponsorship
Babish,   This is a kind comment saying that I am disappointed seeing that you accepted a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy for this episode.  Harry Potter and money generated by the franchise is being used by J.K. Rowling to persecute and attack Transgender people in our society. By supporting her brand and enabling her financially, we condone her actions.
dude you’re a cooking show, take literally any other sponsor. Disappointed idc what anyone says.
Is this the shark-jumping moment? The video where a line can be drawn from "passion project-turned-career" to "profit vehicle"? I'd like to believe not, but what a choice must have been actively made for this.
Disliked and unsubscribed for transphobic wizard game.
Thanks for the Breakfast bro, it was yummy
whats up with all these AI bots saying stuff against Hogwarts Legacy? Like i have nothing against trans people  at all but all this whining about "the Wizard game" it is hilarious
It always baffles me how there's two slices of bread -and its triangle half pieces usually too, unlike Babby- for like 2 POUNDS of meat?! smh
lol, the 'american' version was closer, who did the research here??
Deeply disappointed in the sponsorship.
disappointing
Whoops not an ally
I've loved all your videos, but I draw the line at taking a sponsorship for Hogwarts Legacy. Disliked and unsubscribed. Be better.
Dude, the ad. Really? That's not ok.
unsubbed - I can't enjoy content that supports antisemitism and transphobia
no one makes over-easy eggs with a full English and the vine tomatoes are a stretch
Oooooh no a hl sponsor...
Where's the cup of builders tea?!
Looked at the dislikes and immediately knew...   "The british are coming"
🅱️eans on toast
I enjoyed both versions but I would have to get up before the first light to make American version :D
Babish stepping into the Hogwarts Legacy controversy! Didn't see that coming.
I am frankly appalled that you decided to accept a sponsorship from this game, the royalties of which the author uses to pursue an aggressive hate campaign against trans people.
Really didn't think this would be the kind of channel to accept sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy. Sad.
British food, meh.  British people? 🤮
extremely disappointed you took a sponsorship that directly funds hate. try to do better, BCU
Having grilled tomatos is the restaurant/pub style of a full english but the correct way is tinned tomatos. Never understood why they started serving grilled tomatos, always seemed like a weird choice.
it's sad that you advertised hogwarts legacy :(
Babish is sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy? Oh boy, bet ready for cancelation.
Now I’m just waiting for the botched by babish episode where he does plum tomatoes and scrambled eggs
Fried bread needs actual shallow frying in oil....
Advertising Hogwarts Legacy despite being well aware about all of the controversy surrounding it is a choice.
So authentically British it even starts with anti-Semitism and transphobia!
this delicious full english breakfast is literally killing trans people :( i dont know how but thats what the comments make it sound like
I still will never understand people who like black pudding; eating blood is such a gross thing to do
FliiiiiiiPENDO!
Id like one place where i could NOT hear avout the TERF wizard series.
I have a computer game with different restaurants, and their English breakfast place offers everything here except the potato's. Who got it right? Edt: the game also had biscuits that looked like cookies, and Coffee
i wouldnt have bubble and squeak with it, if you have potato, its hash browns. Bubble and squeak is usually just after a roast meal, or Christmas as its all left over pieces... and i wouldnt flip the eggs... usually the bacon and black pudding would be crispier! *glad you use back bacon however!!*
That is Ham, not Canadian Bacon. Not a single Canadian has ever called that "Canadian Bacon"
Bubble and squeak is not part of a full english,  that's a recipe for using up leftovers from a roast dinner. Hash browns are more common for breakfast.  And cherry tomatoes? Nope.  Decent size tomatoes cut in half and grilled are part of a full english. Nice try though.  😊
Pressing 'sort by new' turned out to be very entertaining. So much fun to see souls weep.
Next I recommend trying out MatPats recipe for the Mean by Patty
Bubble and Squeak is British yes, but I’ve never seen or eaten it for breakfast. It’s more of a after Sunday/Christmas roast dinner  Still, the plate looked delish ❤need me a fry up now
Please find a better sponsor than this. Refuse to watch a video sponsored by this game.
Really disappointed you'd take a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy. JK Rowling is a certified POS, and by all accounts so are a number of the game's lead developers. In addition, the HP universe in general, and this game in particular, is replete with incredibly harmful stereotypes and negative representations of minorities. Normally like your videos, but I'm not watching this one.   I recognize that you probably will not see this comment or care about it, but I can't watch a video sponsored by a game whose creators purposefully spreads lies and hatred.
bubble and squeak is for leftovers, nor for breakfast (am english)
Who actually makes this in the morning?
hogwarts sponsor and fake british food? awesome, a complete and utter disaster
Shout out to Tiny Whisk
How about you post the recipes for the other people who do work on your channel?
I’ll sometimes make what I call a “full Hawaiian” which is seasoned rice, spam, eggs, kimchi, and grilled pineapple 🍍
Is the steam CGI'ed in
But what about Second Breakfast?
Hogwarts, really???? At this point????
Welp, done here. Bye.
The only criticisms I have are I've never seen bubble and squeak in a full english, nor have I seen slices of black pudding less than three inches in diameter. Otherwise top notch job
I'm saddened to see you support and promote that game. It's main story is incredibly antisemitic and it's purchase goes to fund and support a hateful transphobe who uses her platform to attack the trans community.
WHY DID YOU FLIP THEM FRIED EGGS!?  Other than that, great job. Usually bubble and squeak has some more left over christmas dinner vegetables, but I think it's a welcome replacement to hash browns, which I never really rated in a fry up.
You could have done.   Full English Breakfast with extra breakfast From Run Fatboy Run ....a great under dog movie with Simon Pegg
I'm a big fan of Babish, but this isn't a full English breakfast
I'm disappointed in the BCU staff for taking the Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship despite the well-known transphobia, antisemitism, and racism surrounding the creator of the IP and the game itself. These are not topics for debate, and the fact that so many people are willing to die on the hill of their "childhood dream game" just goes to show how far that brand and similar dogwhistlers have shifted the Overton window; creeping normality and all that jazz. I hope that they address their mistake and make amends, but I'm unsubbing for now - I hope that this small dent in their metrics makes a difference and that anyone who cares enough will do the same.
Dissapointed you would promote this game.
Gotta say, I'm a bit disappointed that you'd be willing to partner with a company and advertise a game that's doing such measurable harm to several marginalised groups.
Trans Liberation Now!
Disappointed by the choice of sponsorship
For fricks's sake, why did you have to accept sponsorship from the TERF? Ugh, bye forever I guess
Is bubble and squeak even a thing anymore? My dad used mentioned he ate it in school as a kid in the 70's and I've never came across it in my life time.
Is it a hint for a new "Breakfast with Babish" series?
Severly  disappointed in the choice of sponsor. Very very disappointing.
I had no idea Andrew was antisemitic
You might want to turn off comments all the chronically online people and "activists" got to it
Don't take TERF money Babish!
It looks like we're gunna get an episode of Botched with all these "hash browns not bubble and squeak" comments lol
Ugh if I’d know this was about HP I wouldn’t have clicked. Don’t take her money Babish ur better than this.
Great
I’m very British but preferred the look of the 2nd version! 😊
Really needed the money from the incredibly anti-Semitic game didn't ya.
Babish has taken some weird sponsors in the past, but this one is just disappointing. :(
People have already mentioned that we don't eat bubble & sqeak in a full English, but I'm more concerned where you got that bubble & squeak recipe, it doesn't resemble any bubble & squeak that I've ever seen. Bubble & squeak is the vegetable leftovers from a Sunday roast so, carrots, cabbage, potatoes, peas, sweetcorn, stuffing, and anything else you might have. This is just slightly cabbage-y mash potatoes.
hey this is a terrible sponsor. please tell me you know better
I've been a big fan for years now.  From seeing your videos randomly pop up in different places across the internet, to subscribing on YouTube, to watching your channel deservedly explode in popularity.  It was the start of my journey to actually improving my own cooking, something I had enjoyed before, but not really thought about technically.  As your platform grew, and you took on new projects, it was a joy seeing you get recognition for building something incredible.  Ten million subscribers was well deserved, and the community you built always seems so welcoming and interested in helping others.  So it's hard to see you running that advert.  Primarily because of the impact of JKR's messaging and funding on loved ones close to me.  But also because it means that you are self-selecting for a community who is actively revelling in the upset this game has caused.  Look at the replies to anyone in the comments expressing their disappointment with you here.  People posting "cope" or "go woke, go broke" in response to politely articulated messages about why some viewers find it uncomfortable.  You have to decide which of those groups of people you want to include in your community.  I personally choose not be associated with those people who are proud to be hateful/spiteful.  I really hope that you reflect on this, and take the time to understand why people are so particularly upset by the message this sends.  If not, then that's fine, I'll just chalk it up to me being fooled by a parasocial relationship again, as I was for the first time with JKR.  As it did in that case, it just seems so antithetical to your messaging.  I hope that you don't follow the same route of doubling and tripling down that led to this whole mess in the first place.
I'm really disappointed that Babish chose to accept a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy. I'm not going to rehash the points of transphobia and antisemitism here because it's been done a million times, but no one seemed to even take notice so I thought I would at least be one voice in the comments. I've been a long time subscriber, but this makes me reconsider that, and that makes me sad.
longtime trans viewer, now unsubbed!! enjoy your blood money :)
OH BOI A Howarts Legacy Sponsorship I sure bet no Internet Mob will lose their minds and go on a delusional tirade about this!...
I went on a cruise around the UK and Ireland last summer and I tried the breakfast meats there in a bunch of places. I ended up just getting regular bacon from the cruise buffet. There's too much filler in English sausages.
Dude seriously with the wizard game promotion??
What is your blood sausage source!!!
The "american bacon(s)" The strips are just awful. Get the bacon RASHER.  WHERE DO YOU KEEP IT?!!? I KNOW IT'S THERE, I'M NOT CRAZY
Professor fig dies at the end of hogwarts legacy no matter which ending you choose and rookwood cursed anne!
dissapointed in the team for taking money from this game
Never in my life have I had bubble and squeak in a fry up
You need Vermont-locally-made Maple Breakfast Sausage. I recommend the stuff made at Vermont Salumi in Barre, VT.
Disappointed in the sponsor, thought BCU would do their due diligence and not align with Harry Potter or other JK Rowling related properties.
Bill's meals from Last of us episode 3...come ON!! Thought of BwB immediately.
Very disappointed that you would take this sponsorship, Andrew. I'm not sure how you could miss all of JK's tr*nsphobic rhetoric. I've been watching you for years, but helping put more money in this franchise actively hurts people.
Your sponsor is bad and you should feel bad. English breakfast is cursed food enough without that extra baggage. Know better. Do better.
Professor Fig dies at the end and there is no way to stop it. Also, Rookwood was the one who cursed Anne.
I mean, you do you....  But, considering that JK has some very particular views on trans and Jewish people I don't really know how to feel on you taking their sponsorship  Obviously you are free to do what you want
Couldn't have done better myself. Bravo, man!
As a trans person I am deeply disappointed in the choice to support Hogwarts Legacy, considering the blatant transphobic views and actions of J.K. Rowling.  I... really was hoping for better than this.
You don't see Kent Rollins taking money from JK Rowling.  Just sayin'.
Very nice full English brea-     PROFESSOR FIG DIES AT THE END OF HOGWARTS LEGACY AND ROOKWOOD CURSED ANNE
lots of fellow brits crying in the comment section as if they wouldnt demolish that plate
No, they've got to you too! NOOOOOO
That is absolutely not bubble and squeak. Flipped eggs? Just no.
nooooo babish not the terf game nooooooooooooooo babish nooooo
It was great until you flipped the eggs, we do not flip our eggs. Ever. Instead we baste them with hot oil (obviously cooked in a pan normally. Maximise the yolk runniness while ensuring the whites are cooked
That looks weak
highly disappointed by your sponsor. i've been a fan for years, but i cannot condone boosting the sales of a blood libel simulator that lines the pockets of one of the world's most influential transphobic bigots. especially at a time where transphobia and antisemitism are on the rise, this is irresponsible at best, and malicious at worst. i had expected better, but as has been said before, everyone's an ally until they're not.
Yo babish make all the money you like, but you don't live under a rock. JK Rowling is a nasty terf and you know it. Please have a care whom you take sponsorship from.
Hogwarts legacy is definitely the best game I've played since Elden Ring.
Love you Babish but being sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy maybe isn't your best look 😅
Seriously expected babish to know better than to accept a sponsorship from antisemitism the game with a sprinkling of supporting transphobia (especially after all the recent backlash) but here we are I guess
I don't want to imagine the amount of hate that babish is going to get because of the sponsorship.
Imagine accepting a sponsor for a game that offends three marginalised  communities and that funds a spoken out Bigot  lost a bit of respect for you Babish
i can't believe you got an offer for a sponsorship from Blood Libel: The Game and you took it. do better
It's been said already, but bubble & squeak is a way of using leftovers from a roast (often Christmas dinner, so it's a Boxing Day thing, don't ask...), it's absolutely not a full English breakfast addition. Every other item is spot on, to use an English expression. Although, often the bread option is straight up toast, or sometimes the fried bread is deep fried until so crisp it shatters in your mouth.
Bubble and squeak defo not part of the breakfast, also you can’t just make bubble and squeak on a whim. It has to be the leftovers from a roast the day before and the ingredients are never exactly the same.
i just 100% the game like 2 hours ago
new series, blood libel with babish
Bummed out that you're taking money from the Terf Wizard game, secure the bag I guess.
I've never craved a full English this much at 4 pm
Don't love Babish taking an ad read for Hogwarts Legacy. At the end of the day, the game financially supports Rowling, a committed transphobe. Advertising the game is an endorsement that I'm disappointed in.
I am also super disappointed in the accepting of the Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship. Going to be skipping the rest of this episode, unfortunately.
I expected comments about memeing about British food, but instead I saw people mad over a video game. Look, I get it, but there's no point boycotting someone over this. I'm keeping my subscription, whether or not Andrew just took the sponsorship over the dollars.
Need to add something Mexican to the second one to call it the "Full North American" :P
Babish noooo not you too
Over easy eggs and fried bread aren't British techniques, fried bread should be soaked in dripping or deep fried. Eggs should be sunny side up
I’m a bit disappointed that you took a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy considering JKR’s transphobic views.
Eggs need to be sunny side up, very rarely see over easy on a fry up
Not bad Babish, couple mistakes though. Bubble and squeak isn’t part of a full English, and normally you would have a portobello mushroom and a big tomato, but your shrooms and cherry tomatoes looked tasty and are acceptable. Most obvious mistake is that nobody in England owns a flat top
I've always been a big fan, I just bought your cookbook the other day, and to say the least I'm more than a little disappointed that you guys would align yourself with someone such as JK Rowling and her game of blood libel against the Jewish community, let alone her profits directly going towards anti-transgender legislation..... hoping you guys just didn't look into who was sponsoring you and this was a fluke, but it's disappointing.
Yay another botched recipe. Babish: sorry I literally didn’t try at all to honor anything about the proper recipe, and it didn’t come out how I liked it but here!😊 here’s me TEACHING you the recipe
Interesting choice of sponsor. Hard to approve condoning antisemitism and transphobia in exchange for a paycheck. Honestly I'm very disappointed. As a Jew I never thought I'd see Babish pushing Blood Libel: the game.
I want you to know Im unsubscribing due to this. And you know why.
Wonder why the rounded triangle hash browns across the pond. Is it for egg dipping? :O
Even if you don't agree or partake in the debate surrounding the HP game, you've got to admit that from a business and PR standpoint, accepting the sponsor is a bad idea, knowing your audience. Curious to see how this will develop.
Not loving the sponsorship choice my guy
Sad to have to unsubscribe after years of watching, but yeah - this sponsorship was a big mistake.
nice blood money babish ♡
Really disappointing to see you take an ad for a game that was made by someone who is so deeply and dangerously transphobic.
I expected better than a Blood Libel Simulator sponsorship, ngl.
I get you gotta make that money but I have lost a ton of respect for you for not turning down the ad spot from that wizard game.
Considering the current state of the comment section, I think you better start working on another Botched by Babish, Andrew!
Oh no...not a Harry Potter sponsor :(
As an English person I am offended that you didn’t fry anything enough…
The breakfast after an wild night 🌃 out
Are you so hard up for money you had to take a sponsorship from a transphobe? Unsubscribe.
Whilst bubble and squeak isn't really part of the breakfast, you made up for it by making a few hash browns triangular. I'm still a little dubious of the black pudding though, looked more continental than the wide dark rounds I see most commonly. Probably just what was available.
They never put the ingredients in the description
Not Babish taking those transphobic JKR dollars 😢
As a trans person, and longtime viewer, this choice of sponsor is incredibly disappointing.
Aw come on Babish, don't do this, please.
Having Hogwarts Legacy as a sponsor is deeply transphobic.
Can you make an accurate krabby Patty using matpat's definitive recipe
As a British person I have to say, you fumbled this one mate
Bubble and squeak is its own thing. Nothing to do with a full english.
Genuinely why did you accept a sponsorship by Hogwarts Legacy? The game is known to be very antisemitic and transphobic, it disappoints me that you align your company with JK Rowling and helping her to profit and spread her transphobic rhetoric. Her presence and this new game are harmful to the transgender population of the UK. I hope you are ashamed of yourself. Please rethink where your priorities lie.
I love you Babish but ten seconds after the advert you’re already wrong. Bubble and Squeak???
Full Ulster is better in my opinion. Instead of hash browns and plain fried bread we have potato bread, soda bread and vegetable rolls that have zero vegetables in them. They're kind of just a spiced mini burger.
Went to the bottom of the comments just to read some rants. Not dissapointed 🤣
Not watching past the ad, promoting Hogwarts Legacy gives oxygen to JKR's hate platform. Please reconsider in the future.
Very disappointed that you are advertising for an antisemitic game/IP owned by a massive bigot.
well this is disappointing. maybe only take money from games/publishers not associated with hating trans people so much??
Really disappointed that you're being sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy. Doing so is (even tacitly) supporting a trans hating bigot, both monetarily, and by keeping her relevant. I truly hope you will reconsider this, whether you mean to or not, you are sending a message that this game is more important that trans lives.
not me flying to the UK to go to morrisons just to get a full English breakfast cus im too lazy to do all this
Extremely disappointed that you're promoting Hogwarts Legacy.
Don't forget to serve it with a generous side of brown sauce (HP Sauce).
Yes! More protein-rich dishes please!
Wow, I never knew Babish was transphobic and antisemitic!
Everyone enjoy this video before it gets taken down because the blue hairs get upset about the Hogwarts ad
Pudding/ blood sausage is more of an Irish breakfast thing, though we're so close you will see them in the UK.
So disappointed you'd accept sponsorship from this game.
Guys he clearly made bubble and squeak this time so he has an excuse to make a botched by banish episode later
Not even up for an hour and already getting disliked spammed.
He incorrectly used the “slang” name for every single ingredient except the blood sausage which everyone calls black pudding lol
Shout out Wetherspoons
cant wait for the radfems to start striking down BCU for support transphobes and terfs.
Done with this channel. Plenty of other creators that don't support transphobia.
I feal like a full English breakfast we have scrambled eggs more than fried egg
I love the fact that every time I ask someone what makes the game antisemitic, they can't give me an answer.
You can’t “Americanise” a full ENGLISH breakfast, that’s why it’s ENGLISH
Ah yes, H O G.
So many variations. It is impossible to make a canonical Full English/Scottish/Welsh/Irish Breakfast. For the record I do flip my eggs when frying them. I prefer a grilled/broiled tomato. You need potato bread/ tattie scones / potato cakes (Ireland/Scotland/NE England). To make it Scottish, add Haggis and optionally white or fruit putting. Many would add square/lorne sausage too. For Irish toasted or fried soda farl and vegetable roll (another type of sausage). Ayrshire bacon is a nice variation too - back and the streaky still attached.
Could we not promote a game made with the I.P of a bigoted TERF and developed by an Anti-Semetic White Supremacist? Surely you can get sponsorship elsewhere.
Here come all the political cultists who can't let people have nice things. Y'all every heard of the streisand effect? All your seething is why it's currently the best selling game right now. I hope Babish keeps his integrity and doesn't bend the knee to you woke freaks.  NEVER apologize to an angry mob.
Really disappointed that you advertised for an antisemitic game from a transphobic bigot lady
It has to be Branston…
incredibly disappointing that you're partnering with Hogwarts legacy. your trans and Jewish followers deserve better. I'm unsubscribing.
Was excited for the full english breakfast, but disappointed in the Hogwarts sponsorship 😔
Deeply disappointed to see you take this sponsorship BCU
I "love" how half the comments about the sponsorship are people politely expressing their disappointment, and the other half are calling those people deranged zealots.
I really REALLY Hope that Wizard game paid you a very pretty penny, or like 10s of 1,000 dollar for that sponsor.
Very disappointed you took a sponsorship for an incredibly antisemitic work owned by a terf. As a trans woman and someone who is incredibly alarmed by the rise of antisemitism in today's world, I can no longer support this channel and will encourage others to do so as well
Well, I hope the paycheck was worth it.  That's one less subscriber on my end I'm afraid.
Wow babish is a terf
where the blood sausage
I really liked Babish, but I'm sad to see him endorse Hogwarts Legacy :(
You’re missing white pudding
Not Hogwarts Legacy..
Its such a large and versatile meal i usually have it for lunch or dinner and substituting different ingredients is so easy
I know this is only going to stir up chuds but: I'm disappointed you took a sponsorship from the terf game...
And that ladies and gentlemen is how we conquered the world 😁😁
lol the amount of dislikes this video has is absurd
Twitters about to jump down your throat for advertising hogwarts lol I hope not but they are insane people.
Being sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy makes me view the Babish channel differently
I literally was thinking around an hour ago that Babish should make a Full English video kek
hogwarts legacy sponsorship is disappointing 👎
I wish cherry tomatoes are common where I'm from
Speaking of Warner Brothers and Hogwarts Legacy, Professor Fig dies in every ending and Rookwood cursed anne.
Anyone else disappointed he took a sponsor from jk Rowling?
disappointing.
Well...the Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship is a bummer.
Massive respect for the bubble.
As a trans person who loves this channel, really disappointing to see the Hogwarts Legacy sponsor on this one.
A full Scottish breakfast would have been far superior and given you more to do, making tattie scones, fruit pudding, lorne sausage maybe even haggis. These go along with what you did excluding bubble and squeek which no-one does.
If you like full English look up oatcakes (Staffordshire or Derbyshire). They are an oat based wrap used to encase breakfast foods, kinda like an English breakfast burrito
"This video brought to you by the Harry Potter™ Pogrom Simulator"
Really disappointed in you for taking this sponsor.
Mate Bubble is one of my favourite foods but I am not having it on a full English breakfast. Hashed browns are what I’d have I recon. Much love
Yeah... sod that game.
I love the Babish Universe, but I am hurt to see you all accept a sponsorship from Hogwarts Legacy.
It's not far off but I'm thrown by black pudding being called blood sausage, instead of black pudding.
Speaking as a scotsman: For me it goes: Bacon (Which I Pers'nally do in the oven) Eggs, Potato scones, Sausages, black pudding.
I am sad this video is sponsored by Hogwart Legacy.  Yes I am boycotting the game. There are better magic systems out there that do not find a racist transphobe
Picking a controversial sponsor for this one, eh?
Wrong on the first food item. Bubble and squeak ain’t on a full english
Really, Babish? A Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship? Blood Libel the transphobic, antisemitic game? I am sorely disappointed.
Can someone answer why americans always call them bangers that just means sausage it's not a type of sausage
a full english start with bubble and squeak  *all of England disliked that*
Lol babish with the Hogwarts sponsorship. Woke is dead
I can’t wait for the botched with babish when he is forced to do fried bread properly. And somehow get hold of Bury Black pudding to see how different it is to blood sausage.
Bro, you really took a sponsorship from hogwarts legacy? Come on bro, I expected better from you
As an aficionado of the Full English, vine tomatoes are a big no-no, halved large tomatoes only. And there should absolutely be nothing green whatsoever on the plate, so that vine docks points I'm afraid.
Enough people have said it but I'll say it again you don't have bubble and squeak on a full English. It's gotta be hash Browns or just make room for more toast.
Opening a can of worms here Babish. Even the English won't agree on what makes a Full English
Bubble ad Squeak, around these parts consists of, pan cooked, cubed potatoes, chopped onions, and halved brussels sprouts.
Not authentic. 95% of full English breakfasts wouldn’t have “bubble and squeak”. They’d have hash browns, or if you’re in the really bottom of the rung builders caf you’d have chips (that’s chips not the ridiculously skinny excuse for chips you guys call french fries). And they’d have proper tomatoes not the dainty cherry tomatoes (unless you’re in a posh restaurant/hotel), they’d be halved and cooked on the grill.  Finally you’ve missed the sauces- HP (brown) or tomato depending on your leaning.
:\
I'm in the UK a lot.  I've only ever had hashbrowns, but they are different than US hashbrowns.
Anyone else reading all the comments in a British accent?
I'll be honest I've actually never heard of bubble and squeak, its usually hash browns really
pretty bummed out you took terf money, Andy. :(
This is gonna be on botched by babish soon
A nice addition to a breakfast like that is a potato scone and a wee bit a haggis
been wathcing you guys for years, very disappointed in that choice of sponsor, kinda embarrassing tbh. thought you'd be better than that, you got a lot of people working on these videos
And they complain about how much food we Americans eat
Andrew, I love your stuff, and I’m very disappointed that you chose to work with this sponsor. J.K. Rowling is a transphobic bigot, and she profits directly off of this game.
I have chips (fries) with mine lool
I'm kinda shocked Babish hasn't done this before. And as a born/raised and current American, this puts most of our breakfasts to shame.
As a proud Englishman I have never seen Bubble and Squeak on a full English. Also tinned Plum tomatoes rather than Vine
really disappointing that you took this sponsor with all the antisemitism in the game & the money going to the influential bigot JKR.
I'm surprised there aren't more dislikes... oh wait it's only been an hour
Disappointed in the hogwarts ad, ngl.
here before -babish was cancelled cuz of the harry potter legacy game 😂😂😂😂
Unsubbed for the Hogwarts promo
The game advertised here is incredibly anti-Semitic and royalties go to support someone who is actively working, with money she makes from things like this, to harm trans people everywhere in the UK. Really disappointed you would accept this as a sponsor.
Looks delicious! I wonder what the calorie intake is?
Troons seething
Child labor beneficiaries in the comments be like
I'm a 42 year old Englishman. I've never had bubble and squeak with a full english.  Edit: That bacon is horrendously under cooked.
make sure to not forget to season those eggs and tomatos, besides that, well done looks fire <3
Oh, sponsored by the latest Hogwarts game? Can't wait to see all the comments.
You're definitely poking the bear with this one, we have very strong opinions about what makes a full English breakfast. Personally, I've never seen bubble and squeek on a breakfast as it tends to be a dish made on Boxiblng Day from the leftovers of Christmas dinner. We also just usually fry our eggs, we don't flip them. But not too bad, considering 😜
biggest babish culinary fail yet: wilingly talked about the terfs latest game
Always wierd to see bubble and squeak purposefully constructed from scratch. Its a dish made from Sunday Roast leftovers (or really any big meal with potatoes left over)
The amount of babish videos has already gone down a lot and when one comes in ages it has a transphobic sponsor better unsub now
Every brit that saw this was poised to point out mistakes before starting it XD
was no other sponsor available for this video?
as a german i have to say i am always disgusted by how little you guys fry the sausages. really, they need more color! they are still half white, watch out they dont bite you since they seem to still be half alive  alvin did that too in a recent video and called them "nicely browned" or something along those lines. they arent "nicely browned" they are "not completely white anymore"
I have never had bubble and squeak on a full English
So many people are mad about a sponsorship, for a game made by thousands of people who aren't JK Rowling. If taking a sponsorship from a controversial video game is all it takes for you to determine if someone is a *bad* person, then I think you need to self reflect on your own personal morals.   Looks delicious Andrew, Those tomatoes look tasty.
American breakfast is just better, it just is
i click off this video once i hear that intro music
Hi there, you should make the full irish breakfast or the irish breakfast roll
I cant wait to read all the comments about Hogwarts.
war in the newest first comments... man
The black pudding looks too brown
Toobad the Brits can’t get fresh tomatoes right now!
Interesting take on a full English. But if this came to my table I would send it back.
Man buys some ham and calls it "Canadian bacon."  That's not peameal bacon. There's not even any peameal on it...
Andrew, where did you find black pudding in the US? I've been dying for some and having a hard time finding it.
when you redo this recipe because of all the comments saying you should’ve used hashbrowns, bring Tom Scott along, that would be a very great video
English breakfasts are so delicious because they're basically a regular meal in Brazil.
Really surprised and disappointed in your support of JKR and Hogwarts Legacy. It's sad to see someone who normally holds themselves to a high standard sell out Trans folx for money.
Jesus he killed the eggs. What did they do to deserve such hate.
For my American version I think I would have used bratwurst instead of sausage links. In Wisconsin we have all different flavors of them now and they would probably be a little closer to bangers. I actually make a version of bangers and mash with garlic bratwurst.
I loved the switch from metric to imperial measurements.
I'm British and have had many full English breakfasts in my 30 years of life, but I've honestly never had bubble and squeak!
JK can rot, so can anyone that supports her. She believes if you support her or her works you support her beliefs.
Don't look at the Newest First comments. It's not worth it.
That's no full English, bubble & squeeze isn't a traditional brekky item here in England, no cherry tomatoes on the vine either, peeled plum tomatoes for a full English. No fried bread, no runny egg yolk either. I'd be generous if I'd give this a 1/10 but it's barely a full English and not even done right so 0/10. Pathetic.
Playing Hogwarts Legacy does not make you a bad person. Do not listen to the extremist far left, they are insane.
Bri'ish?!  Edit: the usual suspects are finally getting out of the woodworks. I just wanna say: this ain't the airport, no need to announce your departure, folks! Bye, and have a beautiful time! 👋 👋 👋
would be nice if you were making breakfasts from all around the world
I much prefer a full Scottish breakfast! Haggis for breakfast, yes please!!
Been a fan for quite some time, and seeing you take a sponsorship from a game that is giving a bigot that hates people like me money breaks my heart.
Everybody knows the American equivalent for an English breakfast is the Denny's Grand Slam
Thumbs up from England although nobody here has ever turned and egg over and fried the other side.  We have just fried eggs, which you'd call sunny side up.
i assume the dislikes are cause of the sponsor
Not gonna lie, really sad you took money from WB to help make it for that TERF. Hoped you be more of an ally.
The lack of inclusion of biscuits and gravy allows me to dismiss your judgement
0:37 and already wrong... Full English breakfast includes hash browns, not bubble and squeak. A quick google search and no mistakes would be made.
I'm quite disappointed you took a sponsor from WBG for Hogwarts Legacy. JKR actively donates to anti-trans and racist organizations and she still gets money out of this game. I enjoyed your videos while it lasted.
where do you even find blood pudding/sausage in the USA I thought that was illegal here
I'd love to see your take on an Ulster fry. I don't think I've ever seen a recipe for vegetable roll but my best approximation has been a spiced beef patty with scallions and red onion.
Man, bubble and squeak is old-skool.
i liked both version.
I understand that the culinary industry in the US is to blame for falsely calling ham "Canadian Bacon", but those slices of ham are NOT what we in Canada call bacon or Canadian bacon. Real Canadian Bacon is taken from the same part of the pig as English Bacon, except ours is then cured and rolled in peameal, and thus we call it "Peameal Bacon" or "Back Bacon". But please for the sake of my country stop calling fried slices of ham Canadian Bacon, because it just isn't.
This fry up looked proper tasty.  I'm always sad when a hotel doesn't have black pudding in their full English breakfast.
:/ nice video, bad sponsor
Duuuuuuuuuuuuude… you sold out to the TERF😢
Gotta say, I'm a little disappointed to see you shilling for this nonsense.
🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
Americans, fyi, that's actual bacon. Not the garbage you call bacon.
Haha. I just booked my London vacation trip and I see this. Thanks.
I am really disappointed that this channel took a sponsorship from the new Harry Potter thing, in light of JK Rowling's turn towards transphobia. It really makes me feel like the people making these videos don't care about how associating with someone so openly bigoted looks to their audience or how accepting money to promote something like that would make any transgender viewer feel.  I know some people got too emotionally intense in their responses to this game's promotion, and while I think many people took that too far, I think it should make it clear how emotionally hurt people were by content creators seeking to make money without thinking of how it would impact those audience members.
this is the way.
Taking a Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship? Okay Babby…
“Basics” with babish
My guy, how ironic that the most authentic version was the second one. Sub the "breakfast sausage" for "bangers" and the streaky bacon for back bacon, and you have a traditional full English.
Zbabish transphobia moments
im just here to say a potato ricer is a waste of money if you have a wire mesh sieve and a rubber spatula :D
Next Episode, some stereotyped Jewish food from the mind of Jk Rowling.
This has botched by babish written all over it
Beyond disappointed to see a creator I love accept a sponsor supporting transphobia and antisemitism. Please, educate yourself and your staff on why supporting or interacting with anything Hogwarts/HP related is only helping to harm transgender and Jewish folks.
as an englishman, i will say i don't think i've ever had mash/bubble squeak when i've ordered a full english its almost 100% of the time a 'hash brown' sometimes roast potatoes other than that pretty accurate
As a person who is fully english, I can confirm this is authentic. Well done geez
disappointing choice of sponsorship
In order to keep the comments organized, you can share your opinions/arguments on the Hogwarts Legacy sponsor here:
crayon heads are on high alert for your sponsorship babish lol
"Hogwarts Legacy is..." the reason I closed the video.
I wish you didn't take money from hogwarts legazy ngl
I hope his next video is a meal from Hogwarts legacy, would be a great idea to have more sponsorships for Babish and also show off this amazing game from an amazing woman, JKR
so disappointing to see u accepted a hogwarts sponsorship. do better
Babbish is based
Very disappointed about the sponsorship. I thought you were better than this, Andrew.
Egg needs to be sunny side up
Bubble and squeak for a full English??? Errrr no, hash browns yes but not bubble and squeak
Babish, I genuinely love and appreciate you and the entire BCU. But the game you have as your latest sponsor is one that has genuine anti-Semitism and gives money to the most notorious transphobe in the United Kingdom who has influenced hateful policies in governance to minorities. Please reconsider using them
"blood sausage" is such a dry clinical term, it's called black pudding
it’s disappointing to see you accepted a hogwarts legacy sponsorship. I’m a trans fan of the channel, and it sucks to see. I really hope you reconsider in the future.
A pretty decent job. I was curious if you would know to do the fried bread.  Blood sausage or black pudding as it is commonly refered to in England can do with a bit longer to get some crispness/texture on the outside so it has a nice dark black sear.  Never in 43 years seen bubble and squeak on a full English breakfast.
I'm not surprised, but I'm disappointed that you took a Hogwarts Legacy sponsor
nothing more english than transphobia. disappointing
A Full English was the dish that made me realise I have gall bladder stones. Stabbing pain in the upper right abdomen for a week. Consume with care
unsubscribing. everyone’s an ally until they aren’t. really disappointing, andrew.
Anyone interested in all the different machinations of a fry up should read Felicity Cloake's Red Sauce Brown Sauce. Highly recommended
that Black pudding looked very sad, you need some proper stuff form Stornoway .
Bummed y’all have a sponsorship with HP legacy
Bubble and Squeak is usually made with whatever leftovers you have, done the day after christmas for example
I’ve always wanted to try bangers
Pretty disappointing to see you take an advertisement for a game whose sales contribute directly to anti-trans rhetoric and whose plot is incredibly antisemitic.  (And just fyi i know a lot of folks will be tempted/ready to reply to this comment with some sort of defense of jkr/hogwarts legacy, but im just going to preemptively mute the replies. So don't bother.)
Andrew I am so disappointed in you for accepting this sponsorship.
Look, I *hate* to be that guy, but are we all just going to *gloss right over* the fact that this episode is sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy? I get that you need to make money, but I'm kind of disappointed in you, Andrew.
It's quite incredible how quickly you said "Bubble and Squeek" after "Authentic", never heard of that being done in the UK 😅
Can’t wait for this to get hounded by the Twitter police. I’m glad this video exists so I can make a Full English Fry Up.
Ugh
Tripped at the first hurdle - hash browns, not bubble and squeak.
@💋 @FutureFarming1 💻🚜 = No más inanición = 🍔
Who did you get to research a full English? A bubble and squeak is wrong, and the eggs are wrong too, big tomatoes and usually just toasted bread. Botched basics
so much contervercy around the game
Here come the woke media to dislike bomb for the hogwarts sponsor.
Oh brother.
When I visited the UK last year I loved the full English breakfast.  But I have to say that the full Scottish breakfast I had in Edinburgh was my favorite!
A full english breakfast, the epitome of cuisine from a nation that invaded the entire world in search of spice only to not use any. So bland, so forgettable.
aw, babish :/ I understand needing money but did you really have to take a sponsorship from Blood Libel: The Game??? it’s horribly antisemetic and racist, nevermind jkr being transphobic. I honestly expected better of you :(
Extremely disappointed to see this channel accept a sponsorship for a deeply antisemitic game which is funding the goals of a very politically active bigot. I would have expected better judgement from the folks working on this channel than to promote the hatred, bigotry, and intolerance which this game represents.
Sad that people in the comments leave over one thing (don't let the door hit you), probably never even watched babish, because over one thing, you wouldn't be calling him what you are
Oooh boy, here come the fire.
Heart disease: the meal
"for health" he says when it sits next to all the rest of that.  I had a laugh
Babyish sponsored by hogwarts legacy 🥴🥴🥴
@BeardMeatsFood would like to know your location
Nooooooo! It's just too undercooked. Get those things all crispy
Ew a hogwarts legacy video AND a bri*tish video? Today is a sad day
I‘m disappointed that he didn’t made the blood sausage by himself.
oh boy, that dislike ratio checks out
Why do some Americans call ham “Canadian bacon”? 😶
I will not watch this video, simply because of its sponsor.
Andrew, please reconsider accepting sponsorships from WB Games and anything involving Hogwarts Legacy or any derivative work of Joanne Rowling. We know you're better than this.
Fun fact: UK eggs are unpasteurized and are kept room temp. They can be found in grocery stores (shops) near the bread section. And they're waaay tastier than most store bought USA eggs.
i like. don't mean to be rude but did you seriously take money from the game that is notably anti semitic and directly supports trans discrimination? to advertise it to ten million followers? really?
didnt know you'd so happily support a franchise created by such an openly transphobic, racist and anti-semetic person.
Jesus. Please stop calling those sausage "Bangers". Super cringe. No one calls them that.
Have to admit I'm really disappointed you accepted this particular sponsorship.
Disappointed by the choice of sponsor.
It's very rare to find anyone make a full English breakfast correctly, so congrats to Babbish here 🥳. Although hash browns are more common, and two slices of regular toast is common too, and don't forget a cup of tea!
Full english in an old pub in York with a hangover from the previous night is the absoluut best
Babish is a TERF confirmed
only 60% authentic, eggs are waaaaay too overcooked... WHERE is the YOLK... It needs to be sunny side up... And we have hash browns not bubble and squeak with a Full english
So many clowns in the comment section
I've been subbed since your videos first got big on r/videos, i would have hoped you'd do better than be sponsored and financially support JK rowling.  I know people who are on the verge of suicide in the UK due to the views she perpetuates. At least i'm somewhat confident J Kenji Lopez Alt would never do this.
Disappointed he’d take this sponsorship, given its ties to the terf who won’t shut up
This is pretty spot on as a Brit but bubble and squeak usually isn't on a full English, even still this looks absolutely delightful!
full german breakfast would be cool
Finally, now English people understand what it's like to have their food ruined by a foreigner.
Que the British Cooked Breakfast crew, as a brit myself I can say this is close but not a full english, a few key elements missing.
"Canadian bacon is the American name for a form of back bacon that is cured, smoked and fully cooked, trimmed into cylindrical medallions, and thickly" from Wikipedia. So don't be surprised when you ask for bacon in Canada and you served regular bacon.
Black puddin is heavenly. It really proves the old adage, once you go black you never go back.
so disappointed to see you sponsored by fascists :(
We had this a few times on our honeymoon in the UK and it kept us full until dinner, very economical 😄
very disappointed to see you take a hogwarts legacy ad. i know you have to pay the bills, but you could at least have some standards. that game is actively funding transphobic legislation in the UK and spreads a dangerous antisemitic message. please reconsider your sponsors in the future.
Very nice but as loads have said bubble and squeak is not usually part of it. Bubble and squeak is usually made with leftovers (from a Sunday roast in my house) and had with our tea (dinner) the next day. Hash browns FTW. Oh and loads of Tom sauce (ketchup) or brown sauce if you're weird.
Please don't work with the HP franchise, Andrew! When asked how she sleeps at night knowing that she's hurt so many fans with her transphobia, she said she "reads her royalty checks." As long as she's making money, she doesn't care if she's hurting the trans community. I'm not going to tell anyone they shouldn't be a fan of Harry Potter, but we gotta stop giving that woman our money.
Botched mate.   No one calls sausages "bangers" and no one puts bubble and squeak on their fry up.
Bubble and squeak isn't part of a full English breakfast.  Seems to be eaten at other meals, not breakfast.
Great episode! Don't let any of these trolls harass or bully you over a sponsorship you took. Keep it up!
Jk rowling is just a feminized not a transphobic. dont punish an innocents game and have fun with Hogwarts legacy
Pretty noice! Just need the hangover beforehand to make it perfect
I am disappointed you took a sponsorship from the wizard game. The author is a transphobe and has stated that she believes anyone spending money on her universe is them confirming her horrid beliefs. In addition the game is incredibly anti-Semitic and should not be promoted as a result.
The black pudding was so pale o__0
With the full English the one thing that was made different is fried bread, typically if your having fried bread it's cheap white bread fried in oil
Interesting choice of Sponsor from Babish considering all the alleged anti Jewish links this game has!
You have to have TEA!  Specifically Yorkshire tea 😄
I’m English and you got it pretty spot on, although we never have bubble and squeak on a traditional English breakfast. Should’ve stuck with the hash browns!
Are the dislikes because of the controversial sponsorship or because he f*cked up the full english?
I'M SO EARLY HELLO ANDREW
Never seen an episode immediately become a prime candidate for Botched by Babish before
If you can find it (or make it yourself), I'd recommend "buckboard bacon" which is made from pork shoulder. I've been told by a couple of older Brits that it is closer to the bacon with which they grew up. Now do Full Scottish brekkie, Full Irish brekkie, and the Ulster Fry-Up.
Wb now your talkingggg.....
As a transgender Jewish person, and a long time fan of Babish, it’s really really disappointing to see you take a sponsorship from a game chock full of antisemitism and transphobia, made by an anti-SJW developer, and funding a woman that is calling for the fascist elimination of my people. Please do better and have more discernment next time.
I understand Andy was sponsored by the game, but guys maybe skip the antisemitic terf game?  Also, bubble-and-squeak is a post-christmas thing, as I understand, not a Full English thing.
So much wrong with this, you hate to see it.
This is so authentically British, it's even transphobic!
I'm disappointed that you have a partnership with Hogwarts Legacy. First video I won't be watching and I'm doubting if I'll keep watching the channel
really disappointed with this Babish. you could have chosen anything other than Hogwarts Legacy but I guess that sponsorship is more important than the lives of your Jewish and Trans fans.
I was kinda hoping for a Wizarding World meal but a welcome British meal nonetheless 😊
what kind of watch you rockin on your wrist babish?
Now do a full Irish…..please.
Do the superior Full Scottish next!
I don't know what's worse, the Hogwarts Legacy sponsor or the cherry tomatoes on the vine XD     Regardless, looks delicious! Interesting having bubble and squeak with it.
To the bubble and squeak crowd:  In theory you only make it and serve it the day after a roast.  i.e. Monday.  Reason is that it's a way of using up the leftovers.   So it could be a part of a full English, but we've never ever had leftovers from Sunday, so, shrug.
With the Americanized version, Let’s call it “A Full English-American”
Apart from the snaggers I’d have either after a night out.
British people where we at? OiOi
It’s unfortunate to see you take a sponsorship from a game that directly funds the suffering of trans people.
Excited for the Botched version of this, where you correct your choice in sponsors.
All of this work to make two breakfasts, and you didn’t make a joke using another Warner Bros. property… What is the point of having a second breakfast if you refuse to talk about hobbits?
Where did you get bubble and squeak from? Nowhere in England will you find it on a full English
hogwarts legacy? why?
love the show... but fried bread is usually deep fried
Worst video I've seen all year lol. Not only did he get the English breakfast wrong and called regular sausages "bangers", but he took the Hogwarts Legancy sponsorship :(
Babish, did you not know that JoKe Rowling is a TERF, and endorsement of her work shows trans people you care more about money than human lives?  I was excited to watch this, until I was told the episode was sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy.
Hard to know what's worse - the hogwarts spon or the bubble & squeak
I'm surprised he'd side with transphobia and antisemitism to get a paycheque
You had to take that sponsor?
Sad to see all those Bots commenting.. Great video as always.
I get that this is a small company and one that relies heavily on brand deals. Doesn't mean you couldn't have just said "No" to working with a franchise created by a antisemitic, racist, a transphobe. Do better
Game is set in Scotland where is my full SCOTTISH breakfast?
If you decide to do a “Botched” on this (or maybe a revisit), I’d love to see you team up with Atomic Shrimp. If memory serves, he actually made a full English breakfast in novelty tiny cast-iron pans recently.
Poor wokies be mad :D
True bubble and squeak should be made from the leftover vegetables from the Sunday roast (and while very traditional, you don't see it much in the full English these days). You're also more likely to get a big chunky cooked tomato than small cherries, and the UK does NOT do over-easy fried eggs.  But none of that compares to the single most important ingredient that you missed out - the mug of tea.
Professor Fig dies in all possible endings and Rookwood is the one who cursed Anne.
very disappointed in you taking that sponsorship, guys.
hope u donate some of that sponsor money to the trans community 🤨
Transphobia sucks
How much cholesterol do you want for breakfast? -England: Yes.
Really? the wizard game? after everything?  not cool, guys.
Great video from start to finish
Quite delicious! Another dish well done Babish. Appreciate ya!  Also ignore the nasty comments from users who have nothing better to do than harass others over a nothingburger. You’re better than them.
Needs brown sauce and/or ketchup.
Real shame that you’d accept money from the IP created by a transphobe. It felt like your formula had been getting a little flat, so I guess this was the sign to unfollow.
I'm also really disappointed at the Hogwarts game sponsorship. Even if Blizzard has tried their best to distance themselves from JKR'S trans bigotry, they are still giving her a platform and money to fuel her platform. And yes, the anti-semitism is not particularly subtle either (it makes use of the blood libel trope in an unsavoury manner, and that's just a drop in the whole "this game is bad" soup). I'm not Jewish myself, but if you are actually curious as to how anti-semetic this game is, I highly suggest seeking out testimony from the Jewish community itself, rather than from a random YouTube comment. The internet is big, and you have the wits and knowledge to search for it yourself.
A Hogwarts sponsor... Not you, Babish.  Not you...
Very nice, but an English Breakfast will have hash browns, not bubble and squeak. Very cool video
booooooooooooooooooo
I think at this point we all understand that actually concerned people are not showing up in youtube comments to be "disapointed". Instead, hateful and oppurtunistic trolls are using the controversy to attack and harass people.  Ignore, report, and move on.
Oh Andrew :( I love you and your content, and a new BCU video is something I always look forward to, but as a transgender person I have to say I'm disappointed in this episode's choice of sponsorship. The controversy surrounding 'That Wizard Game' are well known, so I find it difficult to believe no-one in the BCU knew about it. I hope this will be addressed in an upcoming video. I am far from the only person in your comments this effects, so I hope you listen to us ❤
Love the content, hate the sponsor...
Hogwarts Legacy is incredible. Great partnership!!
Never seen bubble and squeek with a full English, but honestly, everything else doesn't surprisingly call for a botched episode.   Also, deep fry your fried bread
Once again the internet hate machine shows it's colours.  Random small streamer plays hogwarts: Mass harassment.  Big YT channel actively advertises for hogwarts, Nothing.
Babish I gotta be real with ya, real disappointed in you for the Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship. JK Rowling's behavior is actively endangering the lives of trans people globally, and you should be aware of that
Normally don't care about sponsored bits, but taking money to promote a game that pays out to a transphobe. Welp. It was cool while it lasted.
I love hogwarts legacy
thanks for showing those SJWs whos boss, btw professor fig dies and rookwood was the one who cursed anne
Ew, the wizard game.  Gross.  Anyway nice full english-- reminds me of @SortedFood doing so many variations on the full english breakfast concept.
Very disappointed this channel would choose to advertise a product that is actively funding hate.
This is one of those things that is difficult to call authentic because every part of England and the wider UK have their own variants of it.
Please don't be sponsored by Hogwarts Legacy
Bubble and squeak is left over veggies from a Sunday dinner
that's a lot of yummy! , is there a substitute for mushrooms & tomatoes?
I'm hungry and shouldnt be watching this 😂😂🥵
Babish I have literally never seen anyone have bubble and squeak as part of an english breakfast, we don't do that, Bubble and squeak is roast dinner leftovers.
Sorry as a Brit I've got to chim in here.   Bubble and Squeak is not part of a full English. Hashbrowns are the traditional accompanying potatoe product.   You don't flip your fried eggs.  Tomatoes tend be larger Tomatoes halved or sliced and fried for longer.  Finally it's black pudding not blood sausage.  Also need a cup of tea.  Sorry, love your videos but these needed addressing.
The British army coming for babish for making bubble and squeak
This is nowhere near greasy enough to be a full english breakfast 😅🤣
Plz gib de foods. Thankoo
I figured you'd know better, man.
lamo the dislikes from the snowflakes offended by hw Legacy
Would love to see you make sausage from scratch, british breakfast sausage and/or cumberland, etc.
Super disappointed to see ads for an anti-semitic, transphobia-affiliated game on this channel.
I know you saved those potato skins and you left the tag on one of them so that thing is getting eaten
Andrew, if you wanna fix this, send that sponsorship money to the Trevor Project
Andy, you never disappoint both by reliable delivery and delicious content. Not to mention consistency.  I can even let slide the applesauce with perogi episode. ❤
As an English man, I always object to a potato of any description being part of my Full English.  Never Never Never!!!!!   As for the eggs, they are never over easy, just sunny side up (and we just call them fried eggs).  The English name for Blood Sausage is "Black Pudding".
Thumbs down for the sponsorship. Sorry Andrew.
A shame that Babish supports hogwarts legacy. A real let down, everyone is an ally until they aren't. Crazy though because Babish was the last person I thought would fall for this.
Needs HP brown sauce
Andrew, I’ve watched your videos for years, always enjoyed the content you make, and I have to say I’m disappointed to see you taking sponsorship money from a product based on the work of a famously transphobic person.  It would mean a lot to me if you considered donating the money to a cause that supports transgender people, and avoid supporting JKR’s work in the future. Thank you.
You know, after seeing the sponsor I’m going to stay away from the comments
What's up with the dislikes? Has been online for 16 minutes, 360 likes, 100 dislikes
Hogwarts takes place in Scotland so they would likely replace the blood sausage with Haggis.
Thought babby would be better than pushing jkr trash but here we are
As others said the bubble and squeak... well in the 35 year I lived in the UK I never came across that and I ate a lot b reakfasts.This is actually much more common in Scotland. Hash browns are a recent Americanization which is common in the UK, in the past it would have been what Americans call home fries. The tiny tomatoes also don't belong, you'd usually get a single full sized regular tomato. If you are lucky you get cumberland sausage too. Easy to make and a real upgrade to the southern type. Those eggs are over cooked too.
Extremely disappointed you took this sponsorship
Its really disappointing to see you take on a hogwarts legacy sponsorship, I know you need money to keep making videos but dont do it at the expense of trans people
Why did you make a full Irish breakfast?  😉😉  (Hint:  It's a question of locale)
I'm British and I remember tomatoes.
I’ve never heard of bubble and squeak being in a full English😂. It would be a hash brown (not the shredded kind) but the rest is spot on
Unfortunately, you put too much seasoning for it to be an authentic British meal
has brown or even chips (fries) are fairly common in fry ups. Also bubble and squeak generally isnt something thats made "specifically" It's meant to be all the leftovers from a sunday roast, mainly being mashed, roasted potatoes, cabbage, carrots, parsnips, any meat like roast chicken aswell. I wouldnt put beef or lamb in it though, i'd rather use that for something else. It basically just a cheap way of using whatevers left from the previouos day
toast not cut in triangels, jail
On a plane to the UK when this video came up in my notifications. Perfect timing Babish.
you should know better dude.... daymn
A full english breakfast is just basically "How much random stuff you can put on your pan?"
A bubble and squeak?! IN A FULL ENGLISH?! I need a British Uncle Roger to roast you for this one
Absolute hard no to anyone promoting or getting money from anything to do with the HP franchise. Don't support transphobes.
Really disappointed that you're willing to do a sponsorship with anything related to J.K. Rowling and her hatefulness, but get paid I guess.
Do a Welsh Breakfast next with Cockles and Lavabread. Mmmmmmmmm :) Also Bubble and Squeak is more a Monday lunch thing made from leftovers of a Sunday Roast and I've never seen it served with a Full English before. Hash Browns or Sautéed Potatoes go with a Full English or I have seen some variations with Corned Beef Hash in it's place. Other than that - perfection.
The most important thing to remember is that Professor Fig dies in all endings
i hate how people call it "Canadian Bacon" its literately just ham slices
"plain toast instead of fried bread for... Health..." Right... I like the pause there.
I would love to see you try and make black pudding. I once watched Nick Nairn try, but he turned white and threw-up before he finished.
wow, this is just disgusting. i can't believe you would do this. i mean, calling what brits make "food"? indefensible
Ooh, sponsored by the latest antisemitism simulator. Neat.
It’s that time again - gear up to invade France once more, boyos!!
Bubble and squeak in a full english? Where did you get that from? Also, please just call it black pudding, not "blood sausage". Literally never heard ANYONE who is actually from Britain call it blood sausage, it's just black pudding. (Because you also get white pudding)
I’m disappointed that you’d promote something by Joanne Rowling
Also never flip an egg on a fry up
I'd say the hash browns are a lot more common with a full english over here than bubble and squeak. The latter is mainly had as a separate breakfast by using leftovers from a sunday roast and cracking an egg on top.
Now let's turn this into a sausage
For St. Patricks day please do the foods from "Derry Girls"
And you didn't use proper black pudding.  That looks so brown
WOAH WOAH WOAH TRANSFOBIA!  REEE XD
Rather be buried alive than indulge in British food
Not the h*gwarts legacy sponsorship……….. disappointed but not surprised
Not watching this due to the sponsor.
Black pudding, it's not called blood sausage.
Looks dead.
Bubble is the left over veg from a roast. It would normally be sprouts or savoy cabbage, carrots peas and onion. Anything other is not authentic. My mums was always made with left over roast potatoes not boiled and possibly roast parsnips.
wowowowow what is with the dislikes?
incidentally, this week I learned that the cliché of bland British food apparently originated in ww2. because of the German naval blockade the British simply didn't have access to imported ingredients, therefore they had to make do with whatever homegrown ingredients they had. that they managed to still feed their families with whatever they had on hand became a point of national pride and so they continued making those dishes to the present day.  mind you I got this information from some random Twitter thread which I at best skimmed over so it's entirely possible none of what I just wrote is in any way accurate. feel free to correct me.
I fully support the trans community but I just think Professor Fig dies in every possible ending and Rookwood cursed Anne and blamed the Goblins
Extremely disappointed to see you take a sponsorship from this terrible, terf-controlled, transphobic franchise.
This english breakfast was so authentic I was expecting Beard Meets Food to make a cameo.
Bubble and squeak is very common in England but you would not have it on a breakfast we have hash browns
You should make Navajo fry bread
I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone call sausage “bangers” so many times without it being followed by mash
Yeah, no. Long time follower of the channel but no, can't accept Babish taking sponsorships for products that profit the transphobe, friends with bats hit crazy activist and politicians anti-lgbt+ and abortion legislation Joan Rowling  Gbye
Ah yes, the finest heart disease cuisine
I love hogwart legacy 🧙🏽‍♂️
This is ALL The American Full English. Bubble and squeak is meant to be made with leftover veg and is a breakfast in its own right, also fried bread is not just done on a flat top, its meant to be deep fired. the rest was fine, a bit poncy but ok.
They drove a dump truck full of money up to my house, I'm not made of stone!
Legacy is a great game, and Harry Potter are great books.  Just because one reads, likes, gets sponsored or whatever by Harry Potter , does not make them transphobic or a supporter of transphobia.
I approve of your choice of sponsor. BASED BABISH. Also, great video!
Not even close mate.
Impressive, very nice. Now let's see Paul Allen's full English breakfast.
It's ironic that the thumbnail for this video includes a vine of fresh tomatoes, posted days after 4 British supermarkets started tomato (and other veg) rationing due to shortages of fresh produce.
The egg is all wrong should be sunny side up. How can you dip sausage in the egg
There is no such thing as ethical buying under capitalism.
As a European breakfast eater, I am going to have to say that that was a very sorry sized looking blood sausage... Usually they should be at least a few inches in diameter.
I don't know who told you bubble went with breakfast
Very disappointed about the sponsorship and the implicit endorsement of all the bigotry directly tied into it. Unsubscribing.
I am deeply disappointed by your choice of sponsor for this one.
Super sad to see an endorsement of a game creating great profit for someone doing direct harm to the LGBT+ community. I thought I'd be safe here with you.
"bangers" literally nobody calls them that. They're just sausages
You wouldnt really have bubble and squeak but more a hash brown (not the shredded kind you sometimes have in the US but more of a tater tot style triangle) but otherwise youve got in spot on. You can add haggis and a tattie scone and its a full scottish breakfast.
Eww transphobe wizard game
Have to say love your  content  but disappointed that this is the sponsor 🔔
Now please get Beard Meats Food to come and devour it
Ah yes transphobe breakfast
If you served eggs like that in my local cafe - you'd be sacked
As a Brit, your pretty on point, but bubble and squeak is more likely to be hash browns in most places, glad to see my favourite occasional meal on here
No HP Sauce? Treason.
You're taking TERF money? Thought you better than that.
oh boy people are going to be mad about this one...*grabs popcorn*
Only Babish would wear a Rolex while making an english breakfast 😂
I just found this video 6 minutes after it was released and it has over 3K views You definitely deserve it Babish.
As a Brit, very tasty looking full English!  However, I'm disappointed you've decided to support a woman who is actively transphobic and spreads anti-trans propaganda. Please do research before accepting sponsors.
lol playing that video game on stream is already kind of lame but doing advertisement for it is a whole another level, really disappointed & unsubscribed
Britain’s ultimate hangover cure.
Babish confirmed anti-trans
the thing this vid has over most americans making a full english, is that Babish actually used back bacon.  Bravo
he made a full irish lol
Congrats on 10M subscribers!
never had bubble and squeek in a Full Monty but ok
The game will be on PS4 and Xbox One soon for those haven’t got a new system. Which I have it PS5 and I’m working on the game on my gaming channel called G-ManHere Gaming!
YOU GOT SPONSERED BY W.B??!! you've made it.
The taste of their food and the face of their women made the British man the best sailor in the world
Pretty disappointed that you accepted this particular sponsorship with the ongoing controversy.
O.O you advertised the Wizard Game!😢
Full Scottish is better. Lorne Sausage, tattie scones and haggis !
Oh no! Poor Babish…
Great, taking Rowling money.  Bye then.
Oh Hogwart's Legacy, I forgot popcorn
If you are looking for st Patrick's ideas then can I recommend northern Irish pasties? Never seen them literally anywhere else
bubble and squeak isn't part of a full english
The hogwarts legacy sponsorship is very disappointing.
Big yeesh
I used to hate blood sausage but it’s grown on me, don’t know how close morcilla is to British blood sausage but I wanna find out! Thanks Babish
ive never heard of bubble and squeak in a full English
Gonna say it, Hogwarts Legacy is a great game
Came to the comments to find the butthurt over the sponsor and wasn't disappointed. Idgaf, im here for the rashers.
bubble and squeak usually has cheese in
this is a full irish the English don't use black pudding or white pudding
Respectfully, dissapointed in the sponsorship here. Rowling is a disgusting transphobe and I wish nobody would support her or projects based off of her stuff which she gets kickbacks for.
Do the prune candy from Talladega Nights
*sees American making a FEB… instantly clicks on video…*  Unsurprisingly, excellent given it’s Babish! I still prefer a full Scottish though…
Well, pretty disappointed that Babish is being sponsored by *that game*. He can’t claim ignorance since the issues are pretty much all over the place. This isn’t cool.
A "Full [any country] breakfast" series would be rad!
I love me a full english, but you need some massive plates to pull it off right.
It sure is the kind of breakfast that will not leave you hungry.
glad to see what's really important to you guys. unsubscribed.
I'd love to see you make all of Porky's Buttered Foods that were seen/mentioned in Looney Tunes episode, "Bobcats on Three"
Bubble and squeak is very British but not part of a full English, you're more likely to get hash browns
Hi Mr. Babish!!!!!
Pity there wasn't a butterbeer to go with it but blimey does that look amazing!
Sup Babish
top 10 channels i love these videos
Best dish in the world 💪💙
Soy salmon, lemon-zest risotto, cucumber sliced into two-inch diagonals at an eighth of an inch width sprinkled with seven leaves of parsley, shredded, not torn.    mentioned in cruella movie
One of the best hangover foods. Fight me.
Kind of disappointed to see Hogwarts Legacy sponsorship from yall tbh
You can use this comment to add all the things that he 'forgot'
Am I having deja vu? I swear I’ve seen this episode already, with those same tomatoes on the thumbnail.
Please make Bubble Buddy's Krabby Patty: No cheese Wheat Buns with no crust Pickles on the left side 4 squirts of ketchup under the patty Non-dairy lettuce Farm raised Tomatoes Carnival style
I’m sorry but I’m english & this is dreadful, Americans really can’t make full English breakfasts they always get it wrong & they make it too fancy, the full English is a working man’s breakfast lunch or dinner, it’s meant to be quick cheap and easy, not fancy or with whole cherry tomatoes like that.
I can’t believe you took a deal from such a transphobic intellectual property
Brit here, I’ll be the judge of this….
I'ma need a boh'oh'woh'ah after this
Buying Hogwarts Legacy directly puts money in the pockets of people who actively work to suppress LGBT peoples.  The moral decision is to not purchase the game.
*Please don’t botch it please don’t botch it please don’t botch it*
Seriously? Supporting JK Rowling? Pass
Full Scottish breakfast is soo much better ;)
Why?
I'll take the full American over this any day.
Uh oh... the comments will be spicy on this one.  Though tbh, I'm surprised that the BCU would accept a sponsorship from such a controversial brand...
Not a huge fan of the Hogwarts Legacy sponsor... Transphobic Antisemitic trash. Shame
I thoroughly enjoyed the entire video
For an early Saint Patrick's Day special video, you should make any green dish like The Ham-Egg-Edon from Green Eggs and Ham cartoon
BRUH
This is one of my favourite meals. Love it
What if you made Bruno's Hot Dog from The Casagrandes episode, "Dial M for Mustard", on any day in March
First ??
First!
First
Pass
