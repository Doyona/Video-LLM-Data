Bread doesn't keep fresher for longer in the fridge, it actually dries it out! Crazy! Same with cakes and things like that. Ketchup would definitely stay fresher for longer in the fridge though!
girl, I keep my bread in the freezer, u keep that bread in the fridge
Those gyozas are meant to be steamed or boiled for 4 mins similar to like ravioli

Nah dont care
What was that brown thing when she was nin the bath
Your the only person I’ve ever known to keep your bread in the fridge 😂
So nice chocolate heart and. Strawberry
I put mine in the freezer if it goes out of date soon . Also I have bread bin
Invest in an air fryer for sure💝
Be careful putting bread into the fridge as it can dry out quicker and become stale in a shorter amount of time than if it was at room temperature. You can put it in the freezer if you have bulk bought it and want to store it then defrost it but to keep it in the fridge and use daily then it will cause the starch to crystallise up and become hard.. your own personal preference though☺️ love you x
You need to look the instructions on the packet
link for the star projector?
I don’t know about other places of course. But I feel like here, at least the area of Canada I live in, it’s the most normal thing to keep bread and ketchup in the fridge.
I miss your family being in the vlogs 🥺🥺🥺
I bought those gyozassss they need to go in the oven
And theres plastic in the wax that's why it wont bend

Wait where was the gold circular mirror from? Love it, Anna said she’d put it in her bathroom but I don’t think she mentioned the brand name🌱
Did you try bending the candle whilst it was still underwater ?? That’s ment to be the best way xx
Ana where is the starry light from 🥰
As an Asian person, I'm slightly offended how you oven baked gyozas from frozen... you should either pan fry them or boil them. If you are ever at an Asian supermarket, do try to find pot stickers where you first steam the dumplings and then leave them in the pan for the bottom to crisp up, they are the best!!
Hi I’m a huge fan of your channel. Just wondering if you could give me a shout out. Mean the world to me xxxx

Anyone know what hazzs Chanel is cauled
This is the top Google answer on how to store bread properly  - Never keep your bread in the fridge. The starch molecules in bread recrystallize very quickly at cool temperatures, and causes the bread to stale much faster when refrigerated.  • Shop-bought loaves should be kept in an air-tight plastic bag at room temperature rather than in the fridge. For bakery breads that are usually sold in a paper bag, remove them from the bag when you get it home, wrap tightly in cling film and store it at room temperature. Bread boxes are great if you want to keep a loaf for a couple of days.

I’m so excited to see the office!!
I could just hear Julie saying "oh anna" when you shown us the dumplings. I think they were meant to be boiled
This girl is just crazy pretty
They have cookie doe little moons at Lidl
How humble Anna is, is so refreshing... Ahh it really made me fall in love with her channel!! You've got this girl, woo wooooo
Keeping bread in the fridge isn’t weird, I always keep it in the freezer
Toast THE BREAD for the rasher sandwich tastes so much better
Yum I mean
Anna I just loved the montage at the end and there was so much food like him
You need to try fabulossa cleaning products they are amazing and make ur home smell so great 🤍
I keep my bread in the freezer 😬
Anna I'm just saying but I think you might getpre sms for something that  i have seen in this video I don't want to say it because I know it can get annoying.why don't you make this trend jk
You should check Sophie Hannah out she has a video on candle making and in one of her other vlogs I think she did the bendy one https://youtu.be/ocLS5hlUtJ0
Yasss the zoflora tip is elite !! One of the best cleaning products !
I keep my bread and ketchup in the fridge, too 😊 much love from the Philippines 💕😘
Please
I’m just wanting to find out can I buy that jumpsuit but I’m from nz
Seeing you keep bread in the fridge brings back memories of my nan
It was probably 4mins in the microwave. You probably needed it in oven for 15-20 mins
It’s definitely normal to keep ketchup in the fridge and it’s fine to leave bread in the fridge being that you live alone because you don’t wanna waste it and it will last longer 😂
Always  kepted bread in the fridge too!
If you read sauce bottles, they literally say to refrigerate after opening 😂 also bread lasts longer in the fridge it just doesn’t keep it so soft.
I don’t think you put gyoza in the  oven.?!😂
Aww Atticus is so so sweet Anna🥰💔💙
I keep bread in the fridge too it’s not that deep😂😂
My little brother has the night light thing and  to make up for not clubbing in a long time u can play music on it ❤️❤️❤️ enjoy babe❤️❤️❤️
I keep ketchup in the fridge
Love you Anna
Yehahhh this is now a Netflix series
I love how Atticus sent you your teddy 😍
Omdsss I was soooo excited to see Aticus ☺️😢
Love this series!!
As its winter, you can keep the eggs at room temperature, they'll be fine, just keep them in the shade. The only time you should refrigerate them in during summer
Please try making little moons ana love you
Your suppose to fry the gyoza or steam them chick!
Bread is better in the fridge to keep it fresh but it can be left out too
I keep ketchup and bread in the fridge ketchup taste so good when its cold
It’s like Christmas everyday!
AHHH BEEN LIVING FOR THESE LONG VIDS 💕💕💕
anna i live in hk and we have dumplings like that but you put oil in the pan and fry them and then they get a bit crispy and nice
Awww I love atticus&julie and of course you<33 I cried too when you saw th Rapunzel toy🥺❤️
I think try steaming or frying the dumplings 🥟
That’s cause you probably didn’t let the oven heat up first
Watching you arrange your cleaning cupboard was so satisfying ✨ You can do so much with zoflora 🤩 I keep my bread and ketchup in the fridge too!
we keep our bread in the fridge cause we live in a really hot place, we also keep our  tomato sauce in the fridge haha i didn't know that  it was weird
I keep my bread in fridge too...lol. what's so weird in this!?
where is the mirror from that you opened in the unboxing? xxx
🥰
you have the same star projector as me :)
you say beautiful too much
month and a half ?? well it’s not
Of course your going to keep ketchup in the fridge and so what if bread isn’t in the bread bin
On your insta stories or something you should do a series like cleaning your apartment and showing products like Mrs hinch x
Wait I can understand the bread but pasta??? I’ve never ever heard of pasta in the fridge unless it’s cooked
I’m crying 🥺
Where is the link to the projector ❣️x
Aren’t u supposed to boil/steam the gyozas 🥟 not put them in the oven read the instructions 😅
I keep bread in the fridge! In Canada 🇨🇦 !! Your right it stays fresher!! Same with chips!(or Chrisps)
tomatoes are better if they are stored on the counter. they taste so much better!
I keep my bread in the fridge to it work my bread glasses a lot longer than it does in a box l’m on your side on that one
This is honestly my favorite series, I'm loving these episodes so much! 🤍✨
your supposed to boil the gyoza for 4 mins it says are the instructions
That letter deserves to go on the fridge!
Anna you didnt put the link in the description for the galaxy projector :( i really want it
I keep my bread in the fridge legit make bread last two weeks instead of two days
Don't worry Ana, keeping bread in the fridge is smart, especially when living alone. At uni I would keep mine in the freezer because it would always go out of date and be such a waste :( I'm like you, I always toast my bread! Love these videos xx
Love thisssss !!!! Can you put a link of which one it is plzzzzzz
she didn’t link the star projector:(
Atticus is such an old soul, such a sweetie. Loved this video Ana! Xxz
Take a shot every time Ana says ‘it’s the little things in life’ haha. ily <3
Anna needs to make little moons
Loved this video,and im so thankful that you put a warning up for the flashing lights from the when you plugged in the lamp as I suffer from epilepsy and sometimes its difficult watching people's videos and not knowing that there is going to be flashing lights ,so I would like to thank you for the warning xx
We have the exact same light progector
Love the vids !! Manifestation is not the way. Don’t put ur hope in rocks. Put your hope in Jesus who made you, saved you and loves you 🙌🏽💕
I LOVE THESE EPISODES SM
Speaking of making ‘three course meal’ videos - You three need to do a ‘come dine with me’ in each of your apartments!! Table decor, 3 course meal, entertainment! That would be a great little series!
You appartmebt is acc beautiful
I put the bread and sauces in the fridge as well lol 🧍🏾‍♀️
Ana it doesn’t keep it fresh for longer 😂😂
Ana i love this new series
I keep ketchup and bread in the fridge,I genuinely thought that was the normal thing to do
Omg aren’t u meant to fry the gyozas for 4 minutes😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Does anybody else think she has more of has and byrans stuff then her own
My bread stays in the fridge too, what's wrong with that...😂🤔
maybe with the issue of keeping bread fresh buy the little loaves if you don’t use it as much? 🍞
I want more you, haz and Byron content. Omg the food looked amazing
Little Moons are just mochi's. It's so crazy how they're popular now even though they are just a Japanese dessert that's been around for years They are good though!
fry the gyoza's!!! use some oil and turn them for like 8 mins they're so good
Omg you moved on too quick from crying, I was still going for a while 😢 I have spent every day pretty much for 23 years with my mum, I still live at home the longest iv spent away from her is 2 weeks, gets me right in the feels everytime you mention Julie and Atticus! I miss them 🥰 xxxxxxxxxxxx
Her voice reminds me of when Millie t moved to London lol
what! i've always kept bread and ketchup in the fridge, i am so confused lmao
I keep my bread on the top shelf of my fridge too 😂😂😂😂😂
I cried so hard when Anna found the teddy i wish my brothers were like hers
You should make sushi for a video x
I keep my bread and ketchup in the fridge too😂
I think you need like the pure wax candles e.g soy wax for the candle bending because the IKEA ones have an oily plasticky kind of coating on xxx
I've never seen anyone try and cook gyoza or dumplings in the oven 😂 frypan girl friend 😂
Who else cried when anna saw the teddy from aticus?
I’m loving these! 🤎🤎 so proud of you always xxx
I’m pretty sure you have to boil the goyozas first! (No idea how to spell that) xx
Bread stays fresher for longer at room temperature but if you want to keep your bread for longer so you’re not buying it so often you can pop an extra loaf in the freezer and defrost that when you need it for bread, toast etc xx
Btw it doesn't work with IKEA candles because they are not made of wax. Look at the ingredients, its not wax.
Am i the only one that bursted into tears when she got the teddy out 💔 i cried so much when she moved out x
It doesnt actually keep the bread fresher for longer, it attracts moisture and makes it go mouldy faster.
You know it’s legit when an IKEA AD comes up when your watching Anastasia xoxo😭😭
Boil the gyozas!!! Makes them so much nicer and then fry them for 1 min to crisp them
Link for the galaxy light? 😍 xx
please can you drop the link for the light? <3
Yes I would love to watch u make mochi 💕
my goal is to be as successful as ana when im her age
How dare you keep bread in the fridge though, Ana! 😂   The reaction to that is hilarious! FYI, I keep mine in the fridge for the most part too (usually sliced bread, teacakes or bread cakes I usually put in the cupboard). And my ketchup. And I’m very happy with my life decisions thank you 😂   Can’t believe I’ve just commented an in-depth post about where I keep my bread varieties, but I felt the need 😂 xxx
Keep the bread and sauces in the fridge, you’re right it does keep it fresh for longer. I’ve always done it too you are not alone :)
Thanks ana, now I’ve got a streaky tan from the tears🥺🥺🥺 atticus and your mums note and little present was adorable🥰
is it just me or is annas long videos the best
Bruh my family has always put bread in the fridge i thought it was completely normal lol
for the gyozas i would recommend boiling them for about 5-7 minutes with a lid on your pot and then transferring to a pan and frying them so they’re crispy :)
Where are you bed sheets from I love them!!😍
I really need to try these ice creams I wonder can you get them in Ireland does anyone know 🤔🤔
I started crying when she got the Rapunzel out 😭
I don’t think it’s weird keeping the bread in the fridge. I live in Brisbane, Australia and with the weather being so hot the bread doesn’t last as long, so I put mine in the fridge too.
Does anyone know what star light it is x
Just thought I would comment to say that they have brought out triple choc chip cookie dough little moons and they look unreal!!😻xx
Found it ordering in the next few days hope my step son loves it 🙈🙈🙈
Every video you inspire me so much with your success!!! Love your videos 🤎🤎

Hey hun, love you. Just to let you know they do the little moon cookie dough in lidl for 2.99 hun xx

Why is there so much fuss about Ana putting bread in the fridge,it is just bread guys !! To be fair,I put my bread in the fridge too but don't hate on such small things because sometimes it is RUDE to a person and it is not nice !! And Love your videos ana !!❤
Where did you get the light projector from ? Xx
ermm the code did not work can confirm
Wow your hair looks so stunning in this!🤍
The gyozas don’t go in the oven!!! Fry or steam them!
I think you’re meant to steam the gyozas lmao
I keep bread in fridge does stay fresh for longer rather than leave in a bread bin to go mouldy!!!!
I’m American and sometimes we keep our bread out but for the most part my mom always puts it in the fridge so I don’t think it was that weird that you had bread in the fridge
I’m not even joking I never cry I just don’t but when I saw the teddy that atticus sent that teddy I was sobbing I mean sobbing it was so adorable and sad but  loves the video ana and the series xxx
Anyone know why she is only staying there for 6 months? X
Goyza doesn't go in the oven, you either steam them, boil them, or steam fry in the frying pan...I'm screaming. 😂
The moving content though 💘. Ana is killing it x
who wants to be an influencer literally just for the parcels and free stuff?!!!!!
Anna they we ment to go in the microwave for 4 mins x
I keep my bread and ketchup in the fridge too its very normal to me. It keeps it fresh!!! 😊
Great episode. Loving  these videos.

Bread goes off quicker in the fridge!!!
I keep my bread in the fridge. You're definitely not strange 💚
me and my mam keep the bread in the fridge and it’s honestly ✨life changing✨
i used to go to the same school as evie and her little sister izzie
When atticus said I love you I cried that was so cute
Would love to see a review of missguided home collection ❤️
Here’s a tip for dinners ana: if you make a lasagne make a few batches and you can then put them into tubs and freeze them so when you want some nice home cook food but you cba to cook just get out a portion of whatever you’ve frozen and heat it up in the oven 🤍🤍
When are you mext going to see your mum and atticus ?
Loved today's video <3 I really want to see what Atticus and Julie are doing at home without Anastasia being there x
I store bread in the freezer because I dont eat it that often and even toast it when its frozen
I keep bread in the fridge but that’s because I have cats and they will literally eat through the bread packet so it has to be in the fridge 😂😂💀Ly ana x

I was totally not crying when i saw Rapunzel  😢 why is atticus soooo cute

Omg nooo you chucked the gyozas in the bin 😔 I cooked them with a bit of olive oil in a frying pan for 10-12 mins flipping them occasionally cause they’re soo delish or u can microwave or steam them xx

Anas face when the music started on the star projector 🤣🤣🤣
ana haz and byron definitely need to do a come dine with me series

You have to wait for your oven to heat up to the temperature that they need to be in at before you put them in otherwise that will not be cooked at the right temperature- and still be cold
ive finally copped your skinnydip case and i love it loads😍😍
Does anyone just wanna live like Ana 😂💕xx
Omg Ana I just wanted to help you through the screen😭😂you're supposed to boil or pan fry the gyozas not the oven!! 😂😂X
We keep bread and ketchup in the fridge always
Link to star light projector please as you said you would in the vid please!!! I NEED IT OMG lol thanks! 🥺💗💗 also ana thanks for being such an inspo to me and my Chanel🥺
The cookie dough Little moons are at Lidl
never once did i think i’d witness a youtuber responding to a controversy caused by them keeping bread in the fridge 😭😭
If you only use bread for toast you can freeze it a just get one slice out at a time and toast it for longer. That’s what I do, but I’m not sure about the fridge 😂
We keep ketchup and bread in the fridge too!! Lol and ketchup usually says “keep refrigerated once opened” also, we sometimes stock up bread and freeze them and just defrost them when needed. They taste the same, texture’s the same. They stay exactly the same and last so much longer!
literally couldn’t be more obsessed with someone in my whole life, livinggg for this series. ily ana🤍🤎
You haz and Byron should do a come dine with me series!!
i thought putting bread in the fridge is normal ?? Lmao ur not alone ana😭
You have to steam the gyozas 😅
Keeping the bread in the fridge is normal!! Never known bread to be kept out 😖

Why is she only staying there for only 6 months ? x
These are the best videos, there very motivational and real! I would love to see them wekly but of course, don't overwork yourself.
Could you possibly do a video on how you manifest and what method you use :)
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RWqpptVlugI 🥺
I put my bread in the freezer haha x
“A month and a half” anyone else brain fart cause it’s literally been only about 3 weeks?😭🤣🤣🤣
Really stupid question but did you not take your car with you?:)
Freeze your bread girl❤️

Don’t worry babe💓I keep bread in the fridge aswell 😂❤️
I’m living for this series 🤎 can’t wait for the next one x
I literally cried when she showed the repunzel teddy from Atticus. Atticus and his mum really miss Anna.
Hey! I’m really enjoying this series! I am a very small youtuber and I am on the road to 50 subs! It would mean the world to me if you could help me out by subscribing! ✨❤️
Wonder what takeaway she had today !!
I liked this video faster than Julie can say No ana
Please could you do a makeup routine when your office is done xx
Buy a cardboard cutting knife!
ketchup GOES in the fridge. bread DOES NOT go in the fridge. but its not a big deal lol
lmao i keep bread in the fridge
I keep my bread in the fridge too 😂 and only for toast. It definitely keeps it fresher longer!! I’m with ya, and I keep condiments in the fridge too I prefer it cold
I cheap bread in the fridge 😄
leave the little moons out for 5 minutes after you take them out the freezer!
I would clean for you any day!
there should be an epilepsy warning on this video
Anna fry the gyozas in a little bit of oil for about 3 minutes on each side! ❤️❤️
Your family is so precious 🥺
not me watching an video of Ana's from two years ago when she was trying food she didn't like and one of them was sushi
I put my bread 🍞 in the freezer and take slices when I need it - only use the bread for toast. I take frozen slices straight to the toaster and tastes fine best way to not waste bread ☺️
Awww so sweet xx 😘
the gyozas you should boil them instead of putting them in the oven, boil for 2 to 4 mins
I keep bread in the fridge too....It's normal so don't worry Ana!
Omg seeing atticus😭😭😭
yo ana don’t listen to the idiot that call u names for having bread and ketchup in ur fridge, i do that too, so does my family.
Hi Anna what’s the link to the lights x
Aw my heart burst when I heard ‘oh Anna’ 😊
Wait anna your telling me that you don't toast your bread for a bacon sandwich
Anna,I loved that gold mirror! where is it from, i'm dying to know? Great video per usual :) hope you are living your best life in your new apartment

Please can you share the link for the star projector please!!! Xx
Love it when it’s a long video
Anyone else see the little moons on counter xx
you was supposed to boil the dumlings first😂 and then shallow fry them for 4 min to give some colour
if anyone feels the need to send a nasty dm about anas bread placement i think they need their head checked ngl
The gyoza said to boil them for 4 minutes haha! 🤍
I’m absolutely loving this series ana. Your getting on so well and embracing life living alone x
They have the cookie little moons in Lidl and I really want to get them
fry the gyoza!!!!
Little tip, put the lasagne on a baking tray. That way when the sauce drips down it doesn’t make a mess on your oven
Aww bless him
Anna, I think you have to boil gyoza’s hehe 😋
I checked the link ana but couldn't see the star projector x
Always kept bread in the fridge, personally think it’s better. 🤷‍♀️😂
Now that I’m thinking about it if we keep wraps in the fridge why wouldn’t we keep bread in the fridge 🧐
This is my favourite vlog😃
Where is the star lamp from anyone??💜
Hi Anna, my family and I have always kept our bread and sauces in the fridge 😃😍 we love you xx
The gyoza are 4 and a half mins in the microwave 🤣🙈
yes can you do littel moons
Anna just brightens up my heart on a bad day, so thankyou anna🥰🥰🥰
I think u boil the goyza? That’s what I did to mine and it’s was so good x
Where is the star light projector it’s amazing !!x🤍
Aticus is so adorable 🥺
Cookie dough little moons are only avalible at lidl, I tried them and they were amazing- defo recommend!

Cookie dough ones should be in lidls😀
Can you tag the projector x
I keep bread in the freezer
Where is the light from? This would be perfect in my new cinema room 😍🤩
I’m honestly loving the long videos so much!!!

a day in the life of ana is Christmas for me
Get yourself an airfryer! The goyozas in there for 4 minutes at 200degrees they are amazing! Food is so much better and A bit healthier!
the doughnut discount didn’t work for me😞
When your trying to watch anas video but she keeps flashing her star projector and sets my epilepsy off 👍🏽🥴😂🤦🏽‍♀️
Is there a day where Anna doesn’t show her parcels 😂😂😂😂
how do you know it stays fresher longer if you've never had it on the counter hahaha
where is the star projector from?!
This is my 17th time watching lol ILYSM ANNAAAAAA
I believe that bread does stay fresh longer in the fridge but it goes stale much quicker in the fridge, but personal preference!
Was so excited for the next episode 😍😍😍😍 did not disappoint ❤️
Please please please do a video on how to manifest I want to start but I don’t know how please do a video on it xx
Ana the code dosen't work
I have that star projector, it’s amazing x
To be honest ur amazing and it’s ur life so don’t let anyone get to u xx
I love this series
I am I the only one crying when rapunzel came out of the box 😭😭
ana, you can find the cookie dough little moons in Selfridges in Arndale! my auntie always buys hers from there and they're amazing! love you xo
I keep bread in the fridge and ketchup. I love you ana
I thought it was so normal to keep ketchup and bread in my fridge🤣😭
I have a box of cookie dough ones un opened i can post them to you😂
i love your hair colour!! stunning 💗💗
Does anyone know the link to the star light projector? xx
see those little moons up there
Anna has always been my role model . I'm 11 years old and want to be like her when I'm older . Although I wanna go to University the way she is pretty and nice I want to be like that . Cuz I feel I will never have a bf.
Ur meant to fry or boil the goyozas😂😭and omg atticus is too cute!💗💗
I am obsessed
I keep my bread in the fridge. Dw. Btw love you xx
My family keep spare milk and bread in the freezer and my friends find it so weird... like idgi😂😂😂😂 When I was at uni I only ever kept my bread frozen bc you just use the defrost setting on the toaster??? I don’t ever make sandwiches I just had toast (and very rare) I didn’t want it to go out of date😖you can keep it like 3x as long ! And if you do want bread you can just leave it to defrost in the fridge for a day??
How is anna so beautiful?💖
You should put your bread in the freezer rather than the fridge, mine kept going off because I wasn’t using it quick enough, but putting it in the freezer I can take a slice out whenever I want and defrost it and it’s perfect!
It honestly made me so happy when I saw atticus. He so sweet for giving Anna his rapunzel doll💖
What is the link for the galaxy light?? ✨💖 xx
Baby oil is the best to get finger prints off x
You have gifflar in the UK😱😍
I think this is such a good idea to have a series on your channel love it ❤️❤️❤️
Love this video so much and I loved the first episode too ❤️❤️❤️
We Stan a lovely boss Queen 👸 👸                  A.k.A Ana
Awwww when ana’s little nan came on face time I felt like crying 😢
Little cooking tip I always put the oven on the right temp for about 5 mins to get it hot then put it in for the time it says x
Don't worry Anna, we put bread in freezer & defrost it because bread goes off really quickly
I've always kept ketchup in the fridge I thought that was normal 😂😂😂
god i wish i got things given to me aha
who else likes the long vlogs
Ketchup 1000000% goes in the fridge.
You should do a video where you attempt to make your own mochi x
What olaplex did you buy and can you do an update on if they work?x
Gyoza get boiled for 4 minutes but they’re not as nice that way it’s better if you pan fry especially in coconut oil, loving the diaries i moved out 10 years ago but interesting to see how you’re settling on your own
Make the little moons pleaseeeee
I keep my bread in the freezer and when i want a slice i just put in the toaster and toast it. (I never make sandwiches)
When anas videos get you excited to move out when your only 15 🤣
Take a shot every time Anna says “oh my god” 😅   love this video, always feels like we’re in FaceTime during these videos 💕
Ana, you haven’t linked the star machine below
Is no one going to talk about who that letter was from.. we need an update Anna
does anyone have the link for the star projector?
Those gyozas are meant to be cooked on the hob :) The instructions on the packet will tell you xx
just a little tip if you keep bread in the freezer it stays even longer and on newer toasters there is a defrost button.
i actually can't believe that you have been moved out a month and a half
I don’t know what the problem is I’ve always kept bread in the fridge😭
Do u have wifi cause ur phone was on 4g ?? xx
U meant to wait 5 mins when u take them out before u eat them by the way xxxx
idk if this is also weird but we keep our bread in the press (cupboard) plz let me k if that's weird, by the way our presses (cupboards) are like a the height of a big fridge I u k wat I mean
Did you recieve your valentines day gift ???? If not its sat in your po box and I really hope you love it xxx
i keep my bread in the fridge too, very normal for me
Anastasia uploads Me clocks on it quicker than atticus can say ‘what a rip off’
Manifesting that anyone who sees this is happy in life and gets what they want 🥲🪱🙂
I was like don’t worry Anna I’m crying with you omg atticus just makes me cry he’s so cute. Love you Anna
I love this series
I’m obsessed with this series ❤️
I think you can get the cookie dough little moons in aldi and for cheaper x
Anyone else to to have a look at olaplex before seeing the price and saying hell no? 😭😂😂
What is behind the door in your office and bedroom ( beside the window)
We love a 37 minute Anastasia video😁
I wish everyone that sees this has a great life and becomes successful xx
The moment you realize you're 10 years younger than Ana's mom,  but you still love her content!
Can u do a morning/night routine
Amazing video but I just searched up can you keep bread in the fridge and it says ‘never keep your bread in the fridge’ also love you so much Anna 🤍🥺xx
We keep are bread in the freezer because it doesn’t go out of date on the best before date.
The IKEA candles are made with stearin, which won’t bend. It’s because they’re chandelier candles and you wouldn’t want them to bend x
I think bread in the fridge is the best thing, especially if you live on your own and/or don't eat much bread!!!
You put the gyozas in the microwave!
Omg I keep bread in the fridge too!
Anna ilysm but bread actually gets staler faster when not in a room temperature place. If you want your bread to stay fresher longer though freeze it! 💕
Pls link the star projector
Galaxy light link? Xx
In the uk bread & eggs need to stay out of the fridge because fridge conditions encourage the growth of bacteria. You are right keeping the ketchup in the fridge though as that's where it should be once opened. Xxx
I absolutely love you and this series so when I saw this I clicked so fast 😂💕💕❤️❤️
Absolutely love these long vlogs
i love how she has her life together GO GIRLL
Best youtuber ever!
Hey Anastasia I knwo you like candle my uncle makes sceneries candle the website is MILIS if you wanna go check it out because I knwo you love yankee candles p.s love  you
Aww. Atticus is so sweet.
I keep ketchup in the fridge because it tastes fresher. I've not tried bread in the fridge but I think it makes sense 😊
Ana would you link the star light xx???
I too keep bread in my fridge cause itd alpt fresh. And it won't go bad
The editing tho! Good job Ana! 😍
I clicked faster than Atticus would say 'what a rip off'
They have the cookie dough ones in Lidl
Ana! Please tell us what you use on your hair, it looks so shiny and healthy
I wish I got free donuts 😫
Aww atticus is so sweet you are the best sister he could have 🥺
You have to boil the gyozas!
Anistastia just has that positive energy that lights the room up ilyyy🥺🤍🥥
please can you link the star projector xxx
Lidl are supposed to have the cookie dough little moons, so maybe check your local Lidl 🤎
Jesus I’ll be sitting on the couch watching your videos then suddenly someone starts chopping onions
Quick note I would suggest putting the meat at the bottom by itself because if it gets on to the other food it can be really bad and make you ill.
Do you know the link for the star projector?x
I am literally livingggg for this series! :)
In this series we need a morning and night routine
yes! bread and ketchup are kept in the fridge!
Anyone noticed Ana hasn't mentioned eating her usual onion snack since getting her own place which comes to my question to you Ana do you still have onions for a snack??? Xxx
I keep bread in the fridge as well lol your not alone Anna haha xx
Did ana say zaflora is cheap? 🥴 please someone agree I’m not the only one who thinks it’s not?! X
Don’t put your bread in the fridge!! It makes it go stale much faster. Google it!
when u dont preheat the oven
I love your family they are so cute! Ily ana!
Ketchup goes in the fridge unless it is un opened otherwise it stays in the cupboard
🎉🎉🥺🥺💖💖 x
Every time I watch this series or just Anastasia’s vlogs  makes me feel so productive lately now going to deep clean my room thanks for the motivation ana
Don’t you have to boil the chicken gyozas or something
Anna if you only use bread for toast keep it in the freezer it will last you a month
Love the longer videos!! <3
Hi
Never keep your bread in the fridge. The starch molecules in bread recrystallize very quickly at cool temperatures, and causes the bread to stale much faster when refrigerated. Shop-bought loaves should be kept in an air-tight plastic bag at room temperature rather than in the fridge. 🍞🤍
i keep bread in the freezer though
🖤
I think you boil or shallow fry the gyozas... possibly why they didnt work. Totally something I would do. Hope everything is going well xx
I keep bread in the fridge toooo!  Stays good for much longer time!!!!
no one misses atticus ana❤️
Omg when she pulled out the repunzel doll and said it was from atticus I started tearing up🥺
Babes I’ve always kept the bread in the fridge too hahahaha
Yess make little moonsssss
im not gonna lie when ana got aticus's repunzel i was also crying
Loving these series i lived on my own for 2 years before my partner moved in . Oh and my partner got my your food+mood t shirt and your self love sweatshirt for my birthday and valentines presents love them 💕@skinnydip
Those gyozas are definitely meant to go in the microwave for 4 mins instead of the oven! You can also fry them which is the best way to eat them I think. It makes the outside crispy :) Loved the vlog btw :))))
You need to pan fry the gyozas with a bit of oil for 4 mins, keep turning them over :) hope this helps ❤️
Awwww I love you ana you Brighten my day so much :) love you so much I'm so proud of you 😘😍
Love the light
If the little moons were in the mail how did they not melt??
Loving the video!!! But can i just say when you google it, it says keeping bread in the fridge makes it go stale faster! You do you though🤣🤣xxx
We've always kept our bread in the fridge too I guess since my parents say it makes the bread last longer
I thought everyone kept their bread in a bread bin and ketchup in the cupboard?!? 😭😂😂
We need the link for the star light! 💖
Cant just be me that cried when Anna started crying :( that teddy 🥺
You meet to make them
me looking for the link to the starry projector and it not being there 😂
On google it says not to keep bread in the fridge because it makes it go stale quicker lol

Anna, YOU HAVE TO TRY THE COCONUT HAIR FOOD , SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER it’s amazing x
Please can you link what star projector you got I’ve been trying to find a good one for ages 🥺🥺
Don’t worry, I put my bread in the freezer 🤣
why are copying @michellechoi ?????
Seeing Anna cry when she opened her parcel from Atticus literally takes me back to when i first moved 6 hours away from home to start university and i remember sitting in my student room hugging my childhood teddy that smelt like home by myself in a new city, with no friends, no idea where anything was... i was so scared! The only thing keeping me going was counting the days till the Christmas holidays. Living by yourself is so cool and i loved the freedom, it just feels awful at the same time knowing everyone close to you is so far away!
who noticed the little moons on the side at the start when they supposed to be in the freezer
Your ment to either microwave or light fry the dumplings not oven cook 🤭, love the episodes Anna! X
That bacon looked like it could of run off the plate 😂💕
I LOVE the longer videos!! xx

I noticed you seemed unsure about the name when looking at Shiseido, for the future it's pronounced She-say-doe 😘
The cookie dough little moons are in Lidl they taste amazing xxx

You need to preheat your oven before putting anything in otherwise when cooking for the required amount it wont turn out well.

4:40 I’m not crying your crying
i waiting for the outro and got sad when you didnt blow a kiss is it a problem maybe :) i need help ly xx
Also what's that door to the outside?? Do you have a balcony or fire escape? Intriguing
LOVED THIS VIDEO
you really shouldn't put veg with meat in the fridge as it will cross-contaminate and you could get ill
Do you receive letters from your supporters still? Used to love watching you open/read them 💖 p.s would have called us fans but know you don't like calling us that 🙊🙊🥰🥰🥰🥰
Every time I watch Ana’s videos it just hits me how beautiful she is like omg !!
Just an idea for your office. Might be nice to have your desk infront of the window, so that you are staring at the view rather than a wall. Might be good for motivation and positivity? Also get that vitamin D yahs. Xxx
Where did you get your bath rack from??

Tip for stopping the cheese melting down and making a mess. Put your dish on top of a baking tray when you put it in the oven. Makes the clean up easier and you don’t have to clean the whole oven every time. 💙
