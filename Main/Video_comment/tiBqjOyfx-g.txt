5:48 677
Oh 67 lol
Did i hear six seven
nak
5:43 67! 🤷‍♂️
I had a pregnancy ad before this
5:48 6777😂
I was one of those impossible children. I understood when I was little that everybody had limits even the really patient people. So I just had to outlast them. Which I usually did every single time. If Supernanny came to my house, I would have been one of the episodes that did not get aired. The second I realized she was there for me she would have either left early or hit me.
2025 anyone?
5:47 6-77777

10:19 to me it is actually true just saying you're rude or naughty won't stop the children to scream at their parents it'll just continue because they think they're the ones in charge of everybody in the household

This is why I don't want kids and why abortions are important
10:38 I remember being put in the corner but it wasn't really a corner and my mom would be making dinner and the would peek over with those piercing eyes to check if I was still sitting their. It was the most boring place in my house

“AHHHH HES BITING” had me dying on laughter 😂 5:06

It’s 00:30 at night. I just laughed out loud my whole family is asleep.
5:48  6…7?!😦
right now we need dance moms
Kids today will get away with murder because their parents don't punish them kids will misbehave and the parents are like oh please don't do that in a sweet voice that's because parents today reward their kids for their bad behavior they do not correct it and the child learns that if they do that they get what they want and this is how you get spoiled man-child like beings or Karen's that never been told no in their life back in my day if I misbehaved like this I would've got my ass whooped by either by the hand, switch, a paddle with holes or worse the belt if these were my kids they would have gotten a spanking on their behind or the belt would come out and then they will be grounded until further notice and before you all go rage in the comets and say do not spank your children because it's cruel and mean first of all spanking your child is a normal way of discipline just don't go excessive you spanked them enough to they know what they did was wrong but do not do it to where you leave marks and this is why kids are nothing but trouble makers today cuz parents are a bunch of pussies that don't punish their kids for their wrong doings instead these parents will reward their children for their bad behavior
Reese: kiss ma willay

8:00 my mom is Hispanic, she just needed to stare at me and I’ll stop because I was to scared to do anything. She is a good mom the best mom for me
The nanny is looks lowkey like mrs trunchbull from Matilda
My niece learned the hard way when trying to bite someone. You try to bite someone; you get hit in the mouth. Not hard enough to break any teeth, but hard enough to feel it. She stopped biting.
I applaud the mom for trying her hardest to raise her kids but she needs to use physical discipline on occasion. If I had ever dared to act like the youngest kid I would’ve gotten my ass spanked good. And the mom look is so true. Even today at 27 years old, if my mom gets that look on her face I silently say “shit!” cause I know I’m in for a tongue lashing. But growing up I honestly preferred getting spanked to having my mom digging her fingernails into my upper arms until I screamed. A few times she even drew blood doing that and I still have a small scar on my right arm from the numerous times she dug her fingernails into my arms.
0:33
Why are they all in blue
9:57 I say exactly that whenever I hear children screaming and crying 😂
3:56 sandwiches for breakfast???
My mum would put me a bed put my feet on the floor hands on my knees & made me look at the wall if I was room & the worst thing is I was really small so I wouldn’t even reach the floor

I don’t care. I’m throwing straight hands.
On a binge and fun fact a friend of mine was on that show as a council for the parents and we talked about it. She was cheating the entire time. Even on the show
Those kids are lucky they even have a room. One time I had to live in a studio room apartment that was cockroach infested for eight months at least.
I’m loving how he exclaims his surprise…  “BLOOD Y JEEZ US”  He makes me laugh I can’t-
Bro with my family flipping each other off is our love language, like when I flip my mom off it's like me saying "i love you". Also bull that a silent mom is the scariest one, when a mom yells(mine) it;s scary!!!!!
Ooooooooo my god that kid getting kicked across the living room is diabolical 😭😭😭😭

5:09 GASP HE’S BITING

Those behaviors didn't just start.  Kids imitate what they see.  Mom should have nipped that in the bud when it first started.
I would say sit the fck down at 9:56 😊
11:30 anyone else hear him say kiss my willy
Before me and my dad was playing rock paper scissors and he keep winning and he teasing me so I got made and I flipped him off and I got timeout
Whenut mom wake# u up and u have Mcdonals for brekkie  0:37 0:37 0:39 0:39 0:39 0:39 0:40 0:40
1:52 there was one uk episode that wasnt aired there was a myth that the mother killed her kids and got executed but that is untrue the kids must have been impossible
The death stare
Problem is, kids imitate. They know what they know from others. Weather that’s mum dad of outside. Now, my boy had cancer at 2 through to 6. Went through hell. Also his father (me) left (before cancer came) then I was kicked out of his life, he had another man come in, mum had a couple more children, they moved plus all the chemo burnt his insides, nails teeth and skin. He was and still is the nicest smartest docile self entertaining ( or plays with others ) so well! Never complains or anything. He also has everything he wants or needs, spoiled rotten. So there are two separate lives there and the one who has the most reasons to act out doesn’t. It is the parents. And it used to be most often, not their fault. It’s just hard to see or admit. Nowadays it’s so bad and they know it! There’s no family unit anymore. No discipline or love in a family anymore. Kids are meal tickets. Money makers. This is why we need to pray!
My dogs named gizmo
Bro daz's video is 15 mins long and the supernanny episode is 2 minutes, he watched like 1 minute of it. He yapped for 14 minutes. jeez

Do you wanna know something when my father got my mum pregnant with their first child? My dad was about to leave but then my mum said oh you Cunt by the way they’re both Australian so you’re gonna leave me here pregnant? Why you fuck off and then he thought about it. then he realised a real man should be with a woman who got her pregnant and they had the first child but she passed away. After when they got married. They had another child and they had four more and they been happily married ever since and they been together for 32 years. My father said if you ever get a woman pregnant you stick by her.
Dude, if i acted like these kids, I wouldn't be alive today 😅
Daz giving genuine advice is another reason why I like you

10:21 Daz talking about the super nanny using the naughty spot. Meanwhile I'm over here reminiscing on the times my mom sat me on a chair and tied me to it with a belt as a form of discipline in her eyes when i was a kid
Tape them to the ground
That dog was looking around us and that's fine?!
My neighbours child(7yrs old) can recite the whole alphabet in swears of by heart

This was just my family I was the well behaved one but my siblings where devils but they only listened to my dad and it was like my mum didn’t mater
I would rather die than have a child.
1:55 tying not to say little shits 😂😂
Love the dog, super cute.
7:47
4:43  curtain
1:22  “Joe Frauhst is dressed like an ikea couch.” Said so casual 😂
She is trying her hardest to keep the kids calm
THAT POOR MUM HER KIDS ARE KICKING SWEARING PUNCHING AND BITING SAD
Every morning when I went to school, since my shoes were always so dirty, throughout the whole of year 5 every single morning as I came through the gate my headteacher would comment on my shoes and told me they were “shiny” when really they just really weren’t muddy. 😭
Like little N@zi's 😂😂😂
Is it just me or do the little boy says things that is wrong
When I was a kid, I used to be a pain
"Wivf"
7:57 im making that my alarm. ‘THATS NAUGH-TY!’
Gizmo is Daz's bio child
1:42 CAT 🐈
How do you make a 2 minute video 15 minutes 😂😂😂😂
If I done that my mum will smack us
Don’t wana be that one person for attention but I had a dog called gizmo but he died…. 🕊️
My son was like that little boy from 3-4. I started to say ‘im not safe with you rn so im going to move away from you’ and made sure to stay close enough to watch him but not let him touch me. As soon as he calmed down i came back and we talked about what was wrong and emotions and what we can do instead of hurt others or ourselves. It took a year but now i have a 5 year old who takes deep breaths, communicates when hes sad or angry, knows when to take himself away and knows its wrong to hurt himself or others. It takes time but its so worth it
Daz: i should be super nanny! Daz in that Mrs.Doubtfire scene: can you make me a woman?
I’m so happy he’s found his special someone
Joe what ever her name is she looks like Mrs truntball
the dog is so cute
The oldest can beat the kids and not go to jail

Anyone

Do dogs eyes are popping out😂😂😂😂😂😂😅
Recce be like "kiss my willy
4:13 must have hurt but I love Daz reaction
U never Fail to make me laugh😂😂
"I give the mum a month before she's dead" 😂
Did the nanny do anything?
I think the young boy probably has undiagnosed autism. They way he acts is often common for a neurodivergent child who doesn’t know who to regulate their emotions
2:39 Halsey in 2015
5:45 daughter???
I don't care I'm 15 but I'll be there for my son no matter what bro

“I relocate her jaw” 😂😂😭😭
The strongest team on earth
Pls dont use Gods name in vain 😢😢
Daz should be replaced for jo’s job
UR DOG IS SOOO CUTE
I would not tolerate it at all whatsoever.
Honestly if I was a parent and my kids behaved this badly I would take all of their toys away all of their electronics away I would leave them a bed with a pillow covers and sheets a set of clothing for each day and if they decide to slam the door I'll take that too.
Oh sweetie you don't want to eat what I've prepared for you what I've bought for you what I paid for for you to eat that's okay you can go without food let's see how long you'll last.
Daz's mom was so proud because she bought him those shoes she paid for those shoes so really it was her certificate that's why she put it on the fridge.
When the little one was hitting his mom, a walking dead ad came on😂😂
I would've gotten smaked so fast I would be in a coma if I hit my mom like that
Bro reece is a fighter at 4 years old 😳
"That's how I get Mum's attention I relocated her jaw" will still be one of the funniest things I've ever heard him say😂😂
Cough, Cough... Adoption... Cough, Cough
Bruh, I would give my mom a bad look and I'd get my ass whooped, but slapping??? Oh I'd be dead 😂
11:30 KISS MY WHAT!?
That oooooohhhhh was to good
Nah at that moment he noo he fucked up😂
Death look
The mom senses are real.   Mine did it too, I knew not to piss her off
Gimme ah dollah
Daz has a more emphasising scream of the kid biting someone rather than the lady actually being bitten lol.
2:13 🤣
Please bring gizmo back in more videos.
14:32 a wise daz once said
Ive just had a dog Called gismo who just passed away
I know this was 3 years ago, but there are some sad ones we’re pacifically one in general were the mother of the children has died a few months before and as the children are around 5 there confused and lost and just very very upset and the father doesn’t seem to see it that way as these children don’t know how to cope. Most of the kids have seen this behaviour from somewhere and that’s quite sad as they couldn’t have just one day started acting like this for nothing!
Not going to lie here, when I was in 10th grade, I was not doing the best, but still managed to pass first try, at the end of that school, I was given the award for door opener. Both my mother and I were super mad. The only reason I got this so called "award" Is because I almost always opened the door for others during my class time, but I did it only out of kindness. In my mind I thought to myself, " If I didn't deserve an award, don't give me one, and I will work harder next year to get one". The world we know today is so soft.
If I did that my ass would dropped kicked 😂
5:05 cannibal
13:44 This is something people my age don't seem to understand. When you have sex (especially outside of marriage), you accept the possibility of having a child.
8:43
When my friend was two and I was two he use to bite people one time he bit me so I bit him really hard on the cheek he never bit again im about to be 14 and he’s about to be 15
OMG, I am drinking tea right now while watching Daz 😂😂
I lost it when the kid said to his  mum kiss my wille😂😂11:27

7:04 that's a Barbie
One amazing father figure 😊 all good vibes
I paused at 8:20
And joe frost looks like a IKEA couch 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
7:47 "ooo my god, some kids gonna get drop kicked across the living room"
4:14 "AAAAGH THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE TIT" 🤣
😮😮😮
Can u pls stop pausing the video so much
When you say blue there was sonic on the tv looking at me 😂 2:39
So funny😂😂😂
Goofy aah dog
Daz your dog is so beautiful and cute
9:16 i go to a vocational center and the director is terrifying. So if you piss her off...... And do that mocking crap behind her back, she's also a mom so she has mom senses lol...... I did it once and she gave me that look and I promised myself I would never do it again. I am glad that I'm breathing.
I didn't realise this was 3 years ago and my heart stopped for a second when you said "Yes, I'm that lonely single man with a dog"!
At this point js pull out the belt
Did youtube comment this vid!?😮🤯
you make me laugh everyday
WHERES THE BELT! 😂😂😂
Daz you need to build like another chair for gizmo!!!! So then he won’t be sad
"little nazis" is crazy
2:39 😮
I have only a mum and 2sisters
14:37 did anyone else see that thing thrown in the back?
4:13 got me laughing 😂😂
Per your own example of your mother, it is NOT normal for kids to just beat up their family members for an extended period of time. If you give them an immediate consequence the first time (I don't even believe in spanking), and don't get weak when they cry about it, they start to learn really early that it's not ok. You can't coddle a child when they're being violent. They need to know that you're angry with their behavior. You don't need to put hands on them in anger. You don't have to raise your voice. You need to be firm, put them on a step or in their room, and do it as many times as it takes for them to finally give up-- and they always do. No talking after the first time, no negotiating, just pick them up, set them down, and walk away. When they're done, ask them in a calm but firm voice, why they were put in time-out. You can help them with this part if they can't articulate it, but they'll get it nearly every time. Tell them to apologize, give them a hug, let them go play. We didn't have kids who regularly hit their parents when I was a kid. It simply wasn't tolerated. You'd stop everything to correct the behavior. No, this is a recent phenomenon.
it took  approximately 13:16 and the nanny hasn't done one thing to help them. instead she js talks out of her ass
My aunt sent me out to the naughty step and said I could go back in when I apologised. I stayed out there for an hour and ended up at the top of the stairs looking at her magazines 😅
I never got shouted at but the British mum look is worse then any punishment.      Idk if they imbue it with hellfire but Jesus Christ that cooked me
kiss my willy 11:29
who needs people when you have a dog
Like a curtain 😂
3:31 shoes??
😂😂 4:15 had me on the floor😂😂
Did that kid just tell his own mother to kiss his Willy WTF
STOP RIGHT BECAUSE IF YOU MET MY MUM SHE CAN SHOW DISIPLINE BY VOICE
growing up in a desi household if another kid is acting out in public we would get the eye saying “do that too and see what I do”
OMG SIGMA
Daz is like a second dad
Super nanny always made me realise that my kids are bloody well behaved 😂, & mine can be little stroppy shits at times I can tell you, especially my 6 year old but my days they are nothing like this, makes me realise I’ve done a pretty good job 😂
The fact I actually had tea.
Can we see ur daughter one day 6:49
AAAAGGGGGHHHHH he’s biting 5:05
Just by a naughty jail or kids
Do you know he said kiss my Willy
9:13 has me dead
I don't have kids, but if I did I am pretty sure that if they acted like this they wouldn't see Father Christmas until they were in their late 20s..
I LOVE GIZMOOOO
You are the best daz 🥰🥰
24 sec in he saying put dowen wow 😢
Boston Terrier’s are the best. Gizmo is precious! ❤
Why does Gizmo look so dumb but so cute 😂❤
00:20 Daz Ive watered you
14:51 realest talk i have heard i wish he was my teacher
its 3 am and i actually have my tea
South Park did an episode on this show where both of the popular nanny’s and the dog whisperer “fix” cartman. In the episode cartman makes the nanny’s go insane and the dog whisperer is successful
If you are single then who is linda
DaZ hAs A dOg
The world has gone soft these days.... I was slapped as a kid and 1) never hurt anyone and 2) respect people.
The four year old when he went on the table he was like goku 😂😂😂😂
THIS HAD ME HOWLING UR TO FUNNY😂
❤❤❤❤❤He's dog
As a kid with mo dad i love the fact that daz gives good advice to men to not just run off and leave a mom on her own
Love giz
the kids tho is like my demonic sister 😭i feel the mothers pain
Disapline YOUR CHILD MUM
Joe be standing there menacing bro😂
My mom was actually gunna call super nanny on my brother 😭😭😭
The dog is all you need😮‍💨

"Let Me Tell You Something Men..." - 13:43  (MOST IMPORTANT BIT OF THIS VIDEO, THE MALE GENDER SHOULD WATCH THIS PART ESPCIALLY!!)
Someone is about to get kickedddd
Bro if I was like that to my mom I would be dead
I love when animals look like their owners.
My friend got a certificate for dropping it low😂😂😂😂😂😂 I'm not joking
Hi

Candy crush hsurc ydnac

Let me in a room with these kids
I just saw someone I my widow 😱
👁👄👁 the dog.
10:00
I’ve seen this episode it so funny 😂😂😂 there like little demon and devils
The black cat: 🌟Mrow🌟
5:31 oh wow. I did the exact same thing when i was a kid. Then my mom bit me, and i never did it again. That's crazy! Lol
8:03 - "more scarier"
Who's watching in 2025
11:11 icl for the naughty spot i had a red circle mat my parents took with us everywhere and they js placed it somewhere and it would be sit down. i never risked getting up, it was bad enough being there when my friends were playing
Bro she’s better than my mom 13:29
4:28, actually the mom was doing good here, because even though he was saying he didn’t want anything and hitting her, she was doing good by trying to know what he wanted so he’d actually eat and get nutrients, energy, etc.
When I first saw Super Nanny, I remember being shocked because if I acted like that to my mum I would be in a coma for 6 months
0:14 I just wanna hug the pupper
7:21 I love it
The boy :said kiss my willy Daz: I SHOULD BE SUPER NANNY
EXCUSE ME, DID THE KID JUST SAY KISS MY WILLIE AT 11:29
I love the fact that his name is Gizmo but I'm also trying to figure out how do I become a YouTuber I'm disturbed by so much stuff that I see and I love watching your channel
✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌
Bros got iggy from jjba
Put that 4 year old in a UFC Ring withConner Magreger
bro id get sent to jesus within 1 min of this💀
“It’s like Spider-Man except she was bitten by another mum” 😂😂😂
At the start just Gizmo minding his own business
9:35  *Calmly explaining the possible logic why the children are being so violent.*  Daz: "I think it's her facial expressions that piss me off..."
That four year old must be seven now
What the f*** is with the broom in the window in the beginning of the video
recce in the shop said kiss my willy
The Daz man
What is your real name
Lol
That kid is gonna be mike tyson JR on da bites and hits
Here''s an idea...stop breeding.
THE DOG OMMGG
Why is it always the kids named Reece 😭
9:15 when I see that I run
3:36
...;)
11:02 i had to sit on a step for it until told to get off it and i was sat there questioning why i am even sitting there
A lot of men suck. A lot of women will say what she’s saying and not let the dad see their kids. No one should talk about this
Why does he feel the need to point out what he knows in every video. Bad trait
Vey funny daz
If there was a dad they would not make a peep because they know there going across the whole living room😂
13,160,390 views just for that intro
11:29 The lil guy rlly just said choke on my Willy?😂😂😂😂
I LOVE GIZMO!!!
When I was little my mam put me on the naughty  step and I just walked off 😂😂
Bro 11:29 KISS MY W-LLY 😂
10:01 trust me click on it
10:01 I’m crying 🙀🙀🙀🙀
BIRTH CONTROL  got me lighting
I love how he’s seeing HER and the problem with everything. Sometimes compassion can go a long way. People get stressed and burnt out parents are the same. Burn out is awful and her not having an outlet or time where she isn’t a mom or referee is very sad. Like Daz said good mom (great mom really)but stressed.  I’m so thankful that as a creator he’s not only highly intelligent but also highly respectful.
“You’ve got to eat” The kid:”oh ok” *proceeds to bite the mum’s leg*
14:44 people who needs it
Hi
14:43 life talk from daz
7:07 i think its a dart
your dog looks like candy hahahah
Your msg for young men about being responsible bc a baby is always a possibility when you have sex should be for young woman also for some reason bc they are woman they get the option to opt out of parenthood if they want they should know it a possibility and if they dont want to a mother they shouldnt be having sex
I love how Daz was talking about wear protection when you do stuff with a girl and also talking about how you can’t leave when a girl is pregnant
3:48 Alright  and thats what what you'll get, you'll ALSO GET MY BOOT!  5:06 AHHHH HE'S BITIN!  9:17 *THE Mum look* THATS WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE 'RD GONNA TO DIE!
daz you have a daughter bro  i thought you were 21
The fact daz didn’t react when Reece said “kiss my willy”
After this video, I know I’m dead this is too funny😂😂😂 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
5:06 bro lil Mike Tyson😂😂😂
Respecttttttttt for everything youve saved my life youve made me believe theres good in this world
I love watching people reacting to videos like this 😂😂
To be fair she isnt really doing anything 🤨 not hating though she is trying
When my daughter was little her and her brother had an argument and just to tell you my daughter’s canines are like vampire teeth and she grabbed his arm and pit into it with her canines and my sons arm was bleeding for a lone time…. And anyone how my daughter comes across I say don’t argue with her you will get one… 😂😅
You are soo unhinged
my lil brother was like this, but he never did thing like this when there are guest att the house never
I love how Joe always looks so disappointed in every episode. 😂😂
I low how Daz says we all need it when it's a drug designed for the physically born female gender
"i would give the man  his juice like put him in a mma ring NOW" the face he pulled was sooo funny
The way he Said BOOTS😠
Bwahaha ur hilarious
This my friends is when you get the spanks in

Ohh my god …some kid is gonna get dropped kicked across the room 😮
I FOUND THE MEME

I like fruit punching
Hey Daz you won’t be single for ever 😢but😅my mum is single she is 32 and her name is Rebecca or Bex 😁I’m nine and my mum is having a baby boy 👦 so I suppose you could date her?yes or no😅
In our family it was punishment by turning off the power box for our rooms ..😅 Not that we were ever that bad, mostly noisy kids playing about
These are the kids I hate dealing with as I work in a school as an educational assistant. Yesterday, there was a child having a “moment”. His eyes were completely dilated. It was scary. He’s 9!
8:19 my mam caught me doing this once
Who is hear in 2024
I always thought of her as a temu Nanny McPhee hahaha😂😂😂
6:00 got to be funny
I thought I heard the kid say kiss my Willy
I CAN'T BREATH 😂
My sister snd i was like this 😂
Hello
GIZMO PLEASE SAY HELLO TO ME
I never bit anyone i however smacked the living sh** out my God Brothers brother i got a spanking i went outside and had him jacked up by his shirt for snitching on me i got in trouble again
Black parents don't play that sh** we respect our parents before birth we grow up and get outta line our parents ready with that belt, sandal, flip flop, wire hanger, switch, Cord,for me I had a wooden paddle I was bad AH 😂 and ect.  I don't have kids at the moment but I helped raise my brother he pushes my buttons and my mom got soft when it came to discipline all of the sudden  She lets him get away with so much  Where TF was the soft parenting when I was his age I was basically dying and everything I was a make a wish kid basically lived at the hospital and my mom still and play with foolishness  My brother is almost normal and she lets him get away with anything 😡
If i swoure i was getting a ass wopping ( im from Belgium sorry if i dont know how ro type)
I love gizmo 😊❤
8:54 is wild
“Yes I am that lonely man with a dog” with his daughter in the other room
I love how much empathy you have daz, so many people would judge this mum and yet you can see she struggling, no time for herself at all and just completely overwhelmed (like most of would be!) thank you for being a better human then most ❤❤❤❤
These kids would not....last in my family. Like...disciplinary family, and likely losing the ability to sit down for a few days.
Get the kids in UFC
8:19 😂😂😂
Spanking

I dont know anything about abortion in the UK but here in America its now cool to rack up an insane “body count”  have an only fans and use abortion as birth control!! Im 50 years old and I am blown away at how CRAZY this country has become.   Im so glad Im old! I dont have to deal with these idiots at all.
6:36 BL-OODY HELL
as someone who grew up with the naughty chair i can say that stuff barely worked. my mom or dad would put me pn that chair and 90% of the time i would get back up
only daz can make a 2 min video 15 mins
Since when did Daz acquire Iggy from JoJo’s
He's so cuteeeee the dog is cute i want him!
The second time daz told the middle finger story lobe it
If you kids are hitting you, you hit back. That is how my parents reacted when I was irrational.
they have to broadcast this as a condom advertisement 😅
Gizmo is him
Parenting tip: get a riot shield
9:16 at that point i will be six feet under
Boston terroir!!!!! EEEEE I love the regular sized ones 😭😍 (mines really small and won’t grow) BUT THE ONES REGULAR SIZED ARE SO SQUISHABLE 😭😭😭
4:46 LMAOOOO A CURTIAN

4:24  I know how to get him to eat. Just don’t feed him. He’ll get hungry directly and he’ll eat anything.
sigma
Its concerning who hes learnt the swears and voilent behaviour from
I used to bite my brother until he bit me back too 😂
When I first watched this i was 13 now I'm 16 and I have a whole new perspective because my mom had to raise me and my 4 siblings on her own and watching this made me realize that it was most definitely difficult. Shout out to all the moms even the ones with a husband but even more for those doing it alone.
Growing up I had undiagnosed ADHD, so my mum found it difficult to even try and do anything with me.
Nope, no, just no! I stayed with my great auntie at times and she didn't play! This little woman would make up pick your own switch, and don't dare pick a little one! One swat of a switch and you definitely knew better than to screw up again! Thankfully I never had a problem out of my daughter when she was growing up.
peach to all these men in 2024, half these men don’t stay if they get a woman pregnant
I can see it in your eyes Gizmo- I can see both sides of the room
Nah these kids are just horrible I didn’t live with my parents only for 3 months when I was a baby and then they gave me up (I’m completely fine I don’t give a fucking care in the world for my mom I love my dad tho) anyways I have 12 but only 5 of my sisters lives with her and they were completely fine (well besides when they got into a fight and ganged up on my mother and they got bruises and so did my mother) oh and they don’t live with her anymore (their with foster besides my two younger sisters and my oldest ran away from foster)
Oh! My nan did the biting thing-  when my aunt was younger, she bit her sister- so my nan bit her on the arm and it worked I never had a biting problem (yay) But my cousin did. So, my aunt just bit her back one day and- boom, never bit again,  One time, my aunt was having a tantrum and had thrown herself onto the shop floor, kicking and screaming- so my nan walked out of her sight (she could still see my aunt easily, but my aunt couldn't see her) and very quick, my aunt stopped having a tantrum
Aw your dog is so cute daz
THE KIDS ARE CRAZY SATENS CHILDREN!!!
I love  you daz 😊❤❤❤❤❤
The mum look 😭😭
hahaha the mum look is sooo true
I laugh so Hard when daz just calmly saids "oh my god some kid is going to get dropped kicked across the livingroom": now that was perfect 😂❤ plz make make of this Daz Games
If I cursed at my mom, let alone my dad I would have a bar of soap in my mouth.   Talked back to them I would get smacked in the mouth.   If I got in serious trouble in school or I did something very bad, my dad would knock me into next week.
“Like little nazi’s” caught me SO off guard–  Daz, please!!! 😭🤣🤣🤣
Why does your dog look high
5:04 she’s getting the mike Tyson special from him

Hi
My anger issues could not handle kids like this. I would leave them in the streets🤣
The doggie looks exhausted 😔
0:51 is don’t have segx 👍
The one thing that I think about the small child, throwing a hit of it over breakfast at the beginning of the video, is Eddie Izzard saying cake or death
Although I absolutely agree with the sentiment behind what you were saying I do believe however that there is absolutely such a thing as being a man!
I got a certificate for most sleepy
Where's  the belt
10:00 2 year old me being fed by my mum 😂😂

12:52 pond kid splash yup 👍 that should work
"Shorten sentence or freedom!"
What a bad mother. Some children are clearly dragged up
I'm not arguing with a kids about what they want to eat. He just won't eat.  I'm not speaking on the kids put hands their parents. I don't understand. I never had these problems. Never will. 🤨
There is always a risk of a baby during sex me who only has gay sex👁️👄👁️
Flashing the lights is effective when your mum has epilepsy (I know from experience)
0:11 my McDonalds milkshake came out my nose
Joe Reminds me of the old principal from matilda. 😅

4:31 I died 😂
7:57 “THaTs NAuugHtteayYYiI!” 👹👺 that got me rolling off my house roof
why is the first thing i thought of when i saw his dog was Iggi from JoJo's Bazar Adventures
8:57 that segment made me laugh so much... very relatable.
Coming from someone with a single mum and a dick dad, daz was spot on.
5:06 AHHHHH HES BITIN’ got me fr
10:47  me and my sister would just slowly move up or down the stairs when my mum wasn’t looking and we both laugh about it now😂😂😂
Bro the 4 kid is not mean
Thrown into the wall🤣🤣🤣🤣
I swear they said shadow the hedgehog was too villont for kids bruh
When i was younger me and my siblings would go on the naughty spot for how old we were like if we were 5, 5 minutes and if we refused it would go up it really worked😂
Watching this is 2024-2025 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Yoooooooooo my brooooooooooo
My name is Katy
BTA
As a kid i wasnt violent until the age of six, but i was violent in my sleep and i couldn't control it because that year was the year I got most of my trauma
“Was that a screwdriver?🤨” TOO FUNNY OML DAZ YOU KILL ME😂
1:22 caught me so off guard 😭
That was me at 4
I can’t explain it but dazs dog looks like him
Yeah and men just mostly choose to leave. I hate it. Be responsible. You started all of this. You deal with it.
4:14 Daz felt that pain
0:30 my brother-
10:36 nah I would be told to sit on the stairs
What breed is giz
Daz got a certificate for the shiniest shoes because they were dazzling
The nanny probs paid them to be good 😂
3:35 I once got a certificate in school for eating all my lunch cause I was known to be the pickiest eater and would cry when they tried to force me to eat 😭😂
Gizmo dazs dog is so cute love him ❤
When your parents are fucking terrifying and thier booming shouts and cave man like looming structured asses tell you to “GET YOUR NOSE IN THAT CORNER” and your 12… yeaa you best stfu and do it or you wont like what comes next.. and yea now ive turned out to be a fully functioning , responsible citizen. Just hope I never have kids bcs Ill turn and do exactly what my parents did to me out of purely.. drilled instinctive behaviors that were used on me as a child. Just food for thought
There are no inherently bad children. Only bad parents. Children act however they're allowed to.
I don't have parents 😅
thay don't have a dad
Shoulda called nanny mcphee on this lot
at 4:16 i was eating dinner and when daz said " oh that was right in the t!t" i laughed and inhaled my food and choked.. all good now haha i love re watching all of dazs old vids
4:37 "YOUR SENTENCE SHORTENED OR FREEDOM?" That killed me 😂
Daz is Perfect Masculinity personified.
I love your videos
My naughty spot was called “the step” 😭
0:13 I can’t tell if he’s looking at daz or me
7:47 i wouldve got hit with a wooden spoon if i said that to my mom
The corner??? I would have to stand in a corner... sometimes I'd be forgotten about lol
I love the fact that he reassured us that he didn’t bite his sister in his 20s and it was when he was a kid I actually just love that. 😂❤
9:15
You’re adorable!! I’m in love!! 😍🍌😍
gizmo is a sigma
The middle finger 😂
A 2 year old i know swears at everyone even strangers 😭

My tooth came out on Father’s Day ITS A MIRACLE 🎉
7:51 “Omg some kid is gonna get dropped kicked across the living room😧” THAT IS SO REAl💀
my mother would’ve sent me home to be with the lord
10:01 this made me laugh so hard i began to cry😂😂
One of the things my dad did with me when was 8 (? Don’t remember the exact age) and rather aggressive, not violent but I would yell and throw insults, toward my sister and them was he took me outside got a hammer some nails and a wooden board and told me to hammer the five nails in. I started to cry and get upset because I actually hated being a nuisance to others and so the idea of disturbing our neighbours with the noise really got me. This was something my Dad knew but me made me carry through and hammer the nails. After that, because I was scared he would make me do it again, when I started getting aggravated I would just leave and go to my room and effectively out myself in time out. It was later found out that I had ADHD and some traits of autism so the aggression would come when I was overstimulated or having a meltdown and didn’t know what else to do.
I am saying T PARTY because why not :)
Oh yes! The look, works everytime 😅
Why does she not punt him into the bin bro #Daz for life
Lol
3:47 daz: alright and thats what you'll get and you'll also get my BOOTS!!!!

Your dog is so cute
6:30 the way the older child is trying to calm down Rhys is adorable
4:14 daz: OHHH THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE TIT!!!!!

Giz is both looking at Daz and at the nearest exit 😂
We had the naughty step where we had to sit on the bottom and the time you sat there for was your age so if I was 7 I would have to sit there for 7 mins.well once I felt like a bad girl and I decided to change seats and go up the stairs and back down on my bum.my mom grabbed me and held me down for the rest of the time.the reason I was on the naughty step was because instead of coming in and using the toilet I carried on playing a wet myself and I had to be held down so I didn’t get it everywhere😂
7:43, If i did that I would get a fucking whooping;-;
Bro that look is called “your lucky were in public.”
At 10:00 I was laughing like hell
"OHH THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE TIT"  I'm dieing
Like little what nows???
If I did this my mum would slap me😢😅😊
The cats meow :))
My kids know what will happen if they me or their mom. Granted they are almost adults and two of them are bigger than me. Doesn't matter. The minute they start throwing hands it's on
You are soo funny 😅
NANNY MCFEE BRO
Is this super nanny or WWE
The only thing that's scarier than a Stern mom is a Stern Karen  that's your mom
Is it weird that as he said BLUE ! I grabbed a packet of cheese and onion walkers Blue packet 😂😂

I couldn’t be a parent, if my kid hit me INSTANTLY wwe finisher
"I see it in your eyes"
I got a certificate for no reason 😂😂
10:30 did he say what I think he said
Theres a story about "the naughty step" from when I was young. See I was very obedient when i got told off and I went straight onto the step. I was told to wait there until i was told to get off. So i just sat there. Then my mum started coming downstairs. Turns out i was on that step ALL NIGHT until 8 in the morning from 3 in the afternoon
😂😂
Adoption is always an option 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
2:31 not even 5 minutes later. 3:58
0:05 i cant tell if giz is looking at daz, the metal gear poster on the wall or the camera
My parents would beat me to 2030😂
“Like little Nazis” 😂
The fact that the eldest was so calm the whole time 😢😢
“He’s just hitting the sh out of his mum handcuff him!” I ROLLING LN THE FLOOR
I’ve been a fan since 0001 🥺
10:00 ‘stands on the table going WRAHHHHHHH’😭😭
Wait….did you ever say “ WHERE ARE YOU GUNNA GET CUPCAKES?”?
When Daz said that abt his mum I relate so hard because I literally said if she looks at you like that run as soon as physically possible cause eventually she will bash you up (the sooner the better)
My life without a dad honestly wasn’t fun but istg daz is like a funny father figure to all of us because he knows how to be respectful and a kind human
2024 any one ????
thats the dog from Strays LOL
I LOVE GIZMO ❤❤❤
my thoughts whenever you show a cup of tea...(ITS TIME FOR A TEA PARTYYYYYY)
5:36 literally saw her underwear.....
I love your dog
“And Jo Frost is dressed like an IKEA couch!”
my fav part 6:59 "that's how i get mums attention i relocate her jaw😋"
"ooooooh my lord some child's gonna get dropped kicked across the living room" got me on the floor
Did anyone's parents send them to the corner (standing and facing a wall until your parents say U can go)

anyone watching in 2024  👇🏻
13:45 what if the woman goes and leaves the man with the kids bc that happens 🧐
#free_ernest am i wrong?
I grew up in the Middle East and my parents wepon of choice is the belt or the shoe
Now, in this case a belt would be very beneficial.
Daz: And joes dressed like an ikea Couch Me: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHA!!!!!!!!
5:06 AHHHHHH HES BITIIIING!!!!!!!
I just imagine racy having the code zombie screams when the mother leaves
0:11 mf be looking like 🌒👄🌘

10:56 i did that when i had to sit at the stairs and i ran upstairs ans locked my room LOL no computer ipad or laptop for 1 week
Idk if this is a good parenting tip, but my mom let the sibling who got hit by a sibling hit back just as hard, we stopped swinging almost immediately, no body wants to get hit back.
At 11:30 when they are in the store, is it just me or does the little 4 year old say "kiss my willy" under his breath?!?!?!
not daz just talking abt the dad but the woman is a single mother 😂
Kiss my what
My brother beats the shit out of me everyday and hes 3 years younger than me 😭😭
3:45 "and that's what you'll get, nothing... You'll also het MY BOOT!!! " best daz line ever
They need nanny McPhee
she should meet auzzie kids that are in juvie
WHERES THE GIZMO MERCH???
“She’s got them all lined up!… like little Nazis.” THAT HAD ME ROLLING 🦅
She must be a single mom cuz I bet if dad was in the picture and that kid hit his mom, oooh boy he wouldn’t be able to sit down for a week after hitting his mom.
daz, were all the single lonely man with a dog (im a woman but shhhhh)
7:20 "no" "FU-"

Daz I love Boston terriers and I’m so glad you have gizmo they’re such an emotive breed
that biting thing, so fucking true daz.
I love his dog🥹 he’s so cuttteeee❤
4:15 “OHHH! Right in the t*t!”
Unreal u guys wow.
Why are you so funny
Tea parties with daz is the best ❤🎉
She is a good mom and they don’t see that😢❤❤
the fact that Tara is single breaks my heart
Did anyone see the fly on 14:40
As soon as Daz said "I've got my tea, i hope you have as well" I literally paused the video and went downstairs, coming back up with a tea to drink while watching this, Tea Party 🎉
my cat's original name was gizmo but me and my sisters kept calling him rizmo
Best words I heard so far : “ AND YOULL HAVE MY SHOE “
Give turtles knives, they deserve them wouldn’t you say
Some kid is gonna get drop kicked across the living room 🤣🤣
Bro the child bit his mothers ass
Oh that was right in the t!t that was right in the t!t jeez that kid can throw- Daz That’s why I watch him
Well it was amateur of time we got fatherly invites from Daz
8:29 I DID THE EXACT SAME THINGGGGGG   Spoiler: she used the shoe, the belt, the wooden spoon and the backhand with rings. Long story short, don’t flip off your mom 😭😭😭
12:22 that door is like the walls in attack on titan
my first reaction to the little shit biting was like ah we got a biter
9:16 the fear of god was put into me

Umm my name is kacey...
11.30 the kid said kiss my willy in the sop 😂😂😂
"Shut up Fucker" got me pissing
Hi youtube
giz and gaz
Why go for the ear when this kid would go straight for the leg
Mike Tyson would be scared of that young boy. I recon he’d go off the diet of ears after fighting that kid
Lonely guy with 8.6M subscribers
1:36 that's Nicholas Cage for me, I have no reason but I hate him his face his voice his acting, their not bad but it just makes furious to not extrent , I sure he's a good guy
Bro literally swore to his mum he's gonna get battered
Oh no some kids gonna get drop kikked across the living room, I am 😂😂😂
8:15
“He’s hitting the shit out of his mum handcuff him”😂😂😂😂😂😂😂I’m dead
KAKAKAKAKAKAJAJJAAJAJA+
i like how the thumbnail is daz flipping off a child
Wait is that a poodle
Cute poodle
omg 🤣🤣
Immediately I recognised the nanny as the one from South Park
I had a Boston terrier named gizmo!!
".AHHHH HES BITIN-" Had me wheezing
Why is he so right
Who's here I'm 2024
8:00 9:12 11:14
“Bite him.” Fr, some kids just need a taste of their own medicine. And if that doesn’t work, they’ll learn the hard way one day that some people punch in retaliation of biting
7:57 THATS NAUGHTY!!
If I acted like this to my mom I’d only have two options, the spatula or the wooden spoon.
Daz really is the best example for young men and boys who are heading into the real world. As someone who was raised by my dad I have so much love for this human. I've followed his stuff for years and can genuinely say his compassion and empathy are almost unmatched. Thank you for what you do Daz 💛
if i tried to even put my hands on my mom i would be dead
Yo if I would've done anything close to that my mom would have taken a switch to me
Remember parents, *always* remember to bite your children 😃
Daz is a jojo reference?! He has Iggy as a pet
He really nailed the angry mum look
“Why is there so much blue” as I’m drawing in blue with a blue stuffed animal in front of me
😂
Daz : he's going super sayan , standing on the table going ARGGGGHHHHHHH😡😠🤬😤👹👹👹👹
Thank you for that little bit about men and boys being responsible at the end. That was really touching. ❤
Shes got them lined up like little nazis i died😂😂😂
My mum does the scary look as well
15:43 hahahahaha😂
Gizmo is so cute
Super nanny doing nothing 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
welcome to WWE fighting
The “Be a man” phrase just means, be an adult male
It was like the cat at the beginning was trying to tell her not to go inside 🤣🤣😂😂🥲🥲
As a kid, if we were in public and acting up, all my mom had to say was “do you want to go to the bathroom” and we straightened up rq. At home, all my mom did was jingle the belt and we behaved so quick
I have a dog named gizmo too😊
My little brother tried to stab me with a flat head screwdriver once. I think he was like 6 or 7 at the time.
6:22 some teenagers re-manifest that spite…and from what Ive seen, it gets worse  Thank god me mum raised me right, I grew up a altruist (I have hope in humanity)
OMG THE LITTLE ONE JUST SWEAR OVER A SANDWICH 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
She should turn off the internet 😂😂😂😂
8:55  yes
Haha! My mum bit me back when I bit my brother too😂
This mum needs police riot gear Jesus shes describing someone whos would be arrested
"This is why I can't do this job" like he was the supernanny
"Like little nazis 🥺"
I think that every woman  in some way shape or form, is attracted to Daz. It's just a fact,
Gizmo is an icon y’all 😂❤
and Joe frost is dressed like an IKEA couch. -  DZ 1:22
You didn't even watch the part where Supernanny starts working
5:07 me never eating breakfast every day and my mom doesn’t get a shit:😂😂😂
5:07 me never eating breakfast every day and my mom doesn’t get a shit:😂😂😂
Bro, I am addicted to Supernanny, bro, I cannot take my eyes off a Supernanny because there’s too much drama to not look at
If I acted like this I would not be here today…
POV age 16
the funny this is- my family is SO MUCH WORSE- my younger brother broke my moms nose- he's 10
I ACTUALLY DO HAVE TEA I JUST MADE IT lol
Your funny 😅
10:00 omg I’m dead!😂😂
Daz never fails to make me laugh
"like little n4zis"
I’m sorry but I would LAY my kids the fuck out , a conversation first of no behavior is changed then I would then use old fashioned discipline.
5:36 Did anyone see the girls panties showing thats messed up why you do that
Is
My fav part: "someones gonna get drop kicked to the other side of the living room" 😂😂😂😂
“oooo my god! some kids gonna get dropped kick across the livin room”
Like little nazis 😂
I love the advice I need to keep in mind when I’m older thank you daz

What breed is he gizmo
If I was the mum I would be thinking is abortion still an option also I would like to see these kids now see if they have changed
Only clicked for the Boston terrier
Omg Gizzmo is just soooo adorable soo wholesome ❤️❤️❤️🤩🤩🤩
British child raised with the "naughty step", the reason it worked for me was because its humiliating being blatantly in the way of everyone and almost on display because you were stupid and did something you werent supposed to 💀 Also the occasional threat of a spanking would do the trick
11:24 lol did he say kiss my willy
that mum look was just spot on
that mum look was just spot on
4:35 freedom
My 'naughty spot' was standing for like 20 minutes facing the corner or the wall. With my mum watching. Literal torture i swear
Gizmo is just Iggy from jojo's
Why was supernanny doing noth8ng
Supper nanny is an icon
Didn't expect a s3x ed lesson from daz
Ready ike? Kick the baby!
hi
Nah nah... What these kids need is one asian mom 😂😂 let's see if they don't get the slipper the moment they act up
My boyfriend wouldn't let shit slide if our daughter did this.
My name is Casey😭😭😭
Bloody Jesus
The first and only time I flicked my mom off because she was telling me I was stupid for not doing the laundry right, so she threw me down the stairs 🤣🤣 am 25 now with back problems and haven't spoken to her in 6 years
YOU ARE THE BEST 😃😃😃😃😃
I think it’s funny kid complain about child abuse but what about parent abuse lmao
7:49 yo if i ever said that to my mother, i would be 6 feet under bro
I watched this video on a TikTok live
CAN I HAVE GIZMO
I want your dog in ever video hes so cute the most adorable dog I  ever seen i'm not even joking omg 😭 hes so sweet
Is it just me or I have imagined Daz falling of his chair backward with his legs sticking up😂😂😂
Hey Daz, speaking of responsible men, I know ONE dude (who I will not call a man cuz he does not deserve the title), who wanted to date me (thank the skies I never gave him a chance) but I found out he is a d**khead in more than one way. From being an animal abuser to a guy who jokes to his friends denying that the newborn in the picture is his, telling ME it was a joke. How can you joke about this? As if that wasn't enough, I even found a conversation between him and his mom, where she told him to at least pay a visit if he is not going to pay the child support (he made his mom do it instead). Rude, delusional, ignorant to the existence of his own biological child and telling other women via chat that HE LOVES CHILDREN and would give his everything to them. ........ And you talking about responsible guys, reminded me of this a**hole. I am glad I never dated him.
daz’s beef with super nanny is my beef with joey king. idk why i don’t like her she hasn’t done anything wrong, just something abt her makes me angry 😭
1:44 that one episode of south park where she was with cartman and she ended up in a asylum
11:37
Y is this my fav video? ☠️ After his David Attenborough impression 💀
Gizmo yay
I love your Boston terrier 🎉😂❤😊
Omg 😦 that. Little boy got a potty mouth on him wash his mouth out with  Soap
They say DO NOT TALK BACK TO ME , I have to say something
James 4:7  7 Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
Me: "Get those kids EMANCIPATED" also Daz: "I have my tea, i hope you do too" Me: "i do!!"
Daz is a legend and a true man
Hi I’m from 2024 🫶🫶🫶
"AHHHHHHH HE'S BITIN" BAHAHA IM WEAKKKK
Send them to Asia 😂
GIZMO IS SO FREAKING CUTEEE
Just get the belt easy
9:57 MADE ME DIEEEE HAHHAHA
7:50 MADE ME LAUGH SO BAD
4:14 I FELT THAT JESUS
5:25 DUDE MY MOM DID THE SAME THING WITH MY BROTHER LMAO
In the 80's in Ireland and I'm sure in England too, we grew up with the threat of the "Wooden Spoon".....terrifying......my ma used to wallop me! And me gran!
13:45 the speech here, is one i agree with, i grew up without a dad, i did not live well, luckily i was an only child, but my mum was 19, without having me, she could have went to college... If i ever get someone pregnant, i fully intend to be there.
7:21 FU-
Has the mother ever heard of a bloody belt, whoop the child jaysus
So did anybody like when they weren't on the naughty spot? Did anyone like fall asleep? My mom would put me in the naughty spot. And I would just fall asleep so that didn't work
11:27 if u wait for a while listen out for the word "u can kiss my willy"💀  And 9:54
great video
This is why i will never have kids
There is a chance she's a widow.
If I'd have raised my hand to my mother she would have flattened me. Then i would have had my dad to look forward to when he got back from work.
You tube got dat rizz
what if i get dared to run off what then?
GIZMO IS SO CUTEEE
I love kiwi I want to adopt her
6:54 that’s how I get mums attention I relocate her jaw 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i have had the worst week and your laugh made me smile
1:22 and Jo frost is dressed like an IKEA couch 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
2:01 got me dying
Omg he is very naughty
Me  too
Daz     hi        😭🤣
Daz’s dog is so adorable ❤
Send except it took two bites for me to stop my grandma and my dad bit me and then I stopped
5:36-8:22
I'm not going to lie when I got put in like the time out corner all I would do is just sit there because I knew if I got up if I left I would have gotten in more trouble and instead of leaving I'll just cry
Were they?
I used to swear at my parents when I was mad, but now I don’t
'That's when you know you dead I was like oh shit'  THAT HAPPED TO ME ONCE I WAS LIKE OH HOLY SHIT AND RAN TO MY ROOM
DID HE SAY HIS DAUGHTER HIT THE DOG!?
14:08 Plan b?
One time i was in my sisters house and was acting up and I got out in the naughty step. Never acted up again😂😂😂😂
12:08  this made me laugh my bloody head off 😂
The dad left with the milk in I think ep 1 Lol
09:18 fuck that is terrafying
i actually look up to daz, he is so knowledgable and then making it funny. but seriously i like how looks at all angles like "im not seeing any dad" and explaining what he did with sarah. he is just such a role model to me and should be to a lot of people
I never thought I would get flipped off by Daz until i saw the thumbnail on my recommended lol
Man imagine if Daz’s neighbour heard him scream “AA THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE TIT!!! RIGHT IN THE TIT!!!”
3:06 got me laughing so hard I think I'm dieing
DID THAT 2 yr old just say kiss my willie
10:01 THE FACE.
“Dressed like an ikea couch”
9:50  now that is
9:50  omg
Daz is my therapy
I had a feeling reece was gonna pull her earing out
am I the only one who considers those kids lucky bc they dont have an asian mum.........?
seeing daz cry about how much he cares about someone he doesnt even know is honestly the nicest thing ive ever saw
But the first time when she asks what does he want he says nothing
Reese is actually saying not fair if u listen closely
Eat him
If the 4 year old was my child I would send them to the psych ward
0:14  dog : 👁️👄👁️
the fact he can turn a two and a half minute clip into a 15 minute video is so funny 😂
LETS BE HONEST THE STAR IF THE SHOW IS GIZZ
I like the mom’s accent
OOOOH THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE TIT
Good morning 🌅🦾🦶🏽👄💋💋💋💋🧠👩🏾‍🚒👩🏾‍🚒🧑🏽‍✈️🧑🏼‍🚒👩🏾‍💻👩🏾‍💻👩🏿‍🍳👩🏿‍🍳💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔🗑️📄

The dad left to get the milk
AH THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE TIT 😭😭
When he said he is a lonely guy with a dog I laughed my head bc when I was 10 I had a 40 year old teacher vi£&in that has 3 cats
Reecees mom droped him on his head when he was born.
When I was born my mom couldn't take care of me on her own so I had to live with my grandma and grandad , I never got told who my real dad was and whenever I asked about him they would look sad and say "you'll know when your older."
U can see Shannon’s pants in the scene when she wants a piece of the attention 😂😂😂
Pffft, Dayummm those children make me look like I was an angel😢😂
Just imagine his head as a ⚽️
5:02 is that Wilbur soot as a child?
Daz about the biting thing, my mum did the same to my brother. My brother still bites 😭
oh my god someone’s going to get drop kicked across the living room😂😂❤
YOUR DOG IS SO CUTE!!!🥹
"Charli bit me"
I got the tea guys   Did U hear what happened to Luke?😏😳😲
"oh my god... some kid is gonna get drop kicked across of the living room" STOP I CANT IDNBIDNCIN
"hes gone super sayian  AAAAHHHHHHHHHH" fell off my chair 😂😂
oh trust you best believe id be the parent they fear
Are those British kids
👶👋💥
Aaaaaaaa hes bitin
I got a certificate for being a good friend 😂
My mom once heard me swear and she back slapped the shit out off me
Daz you are hilarious
I love how Daz is giving the boys and men an amazing life lesson. He can be so funny but sometimes he can be a wonderful lecturer.
I used to be afraid of swearing/cursing in front of my mum, and it simply wasn't an option in front of my grandparents. My mum used a slipper, my granddad used a belt. I was naughty in front of my granddad *one* time and never again after.
More dog please
BLOODY je SUS got me dead 😂 6:42
Kinda a toxic message you make it sound like the father even had the option to be in the kids life, what if he dose not have the option to be in their life cause the mom hates him or he is dead. Your pretty quick to blame all of this on the father when it could quite literally be all her fault or no ones fault that he isn't in their life.
4:43 I CHOKED ON MY WATER😭
I know right hi daz
Gizmo!
THERE'S ALOT OF BLUE GOING ON
10:55 Naughty steps work if the mum is scary enough I used to stand up and go down one step and then immediately go back because I was so scared Most extreme form of rebellion for me😭😭😭
Dog is cute and adorable
Yes
Got my tea hope you have aswell.   Me : sipping my tea 🍵 😂😂😂😂
Why is it that married people try to have kids and have difficulties, but a high schooler can do it with her boyfriend once and immediately be a mum?
I'd always got either the slap ,the shout or dad.Never did I be naughty after 5, back in my country non of my friends like that.
SHOTGUN!!!!!!
Don’t flip off people, your mum
Is it only me that heard the kid say ''kiss my willy''
My mom did the same with the biting thing
Definitely not uncommon for ladies these days to have multiple kids with multiple men for house and waste the free resources we taxpayers paid for 😂
Idk why but the cat in the beginning is so funny to me for no reason 😂
😂😂😂
“There all lined up…. Like little n4z1s” LMAOO
Daz:Yes before you say i am a lonely single man with a dog  Daz: 😂
That is soooo true 😂😂
Daz’s dazzling shoes certificate 😂
Das has the tea, I have the biscuits 👍
Roit, a’s nortey 😂😂😂
I can’t get a girl pregnant, I’m gay
the kids needs a spaking
Yes you are right 😂 just 👁️👄👁️
The supernanny show is why I will NEVER have kids, EVER!
i love how much Daz loves his dog and he is not afraid to show the world that too.
Let him cook
I know the look 😂😂😂
“He’s just hitting the sh out of his mum handcuff him!” I ROLLING LN THE FLOOR 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Gizmo is so cute
I used to view supernanny content as contraception type content, however the more I watched the more I viewed it as a blueprint towards raising your own children. This would only be contraception if you intentionally behaved like a permissive parent. If you genuinely use her techniques or tactics from the beginning of raising your offspring, there is a solid chance that you will not have to deal with the demented crotch goblins that we see on her show.  Ideally you get out of parenting what you put into parenting. So if you put no effort into your children you're going to have crappy results
His dog is a plant he said he watered his dog
Daz you should watch the Duan-Ahn Family Supernanny
Watching 14:50 really makes me realise that that’s exactly what my baby’s father did to me a few weeks ago but without the child support part
"She's got them all lined up. Like little Nazis." Had me dead 😂😂😂
“Wholesome content!”
POV Gizz:NOooOoOO😢😢
The bite thing dad was talking abt my brother used to be the same then my mom bit him and he never bit anyone again lol
These kids NEED Asian parents lmao 😂
not to be mean or anything but your dog is prop gay because he has never seen straight
My mom was once pissed at me, she didn’t do anything to me.. she just literally ignored my existence for 2 weeks and I just kept apologising and bought her flowers and chocolate like every day and it didn’t work😭
Lmao the only way I’d stay put in time was when mom would sit me on the kitchen floor and I’d open the drawers and eat snacks 😂
When Daz was talking about him mom biting him back, I remember my mom did the same thing after I bit my brother and I never bit him again
My school gave me the most improved student award.     I have ADHD....     And hated half the students....    And the teachers.
I got a smiling certificate 💀
I got a certificate for participation once
11:34 where is their father when this goes probably gone to get milk
1:41 didn't eric cartman send supernanny to a insane asylum
0:54 or watch every horror movie with a creepy kid cough the ring cough cough
"peanut butter or jelly" "NOTHING" mum: keeps asking me: choose ur weapon
BLU......DY JESUS  6:35
In some cases tho it is better for the parents to split. On the other hand if the parents are staying together for the kids while they are putting them in a traumatizing and dangerous environment, they are just hurting those kids just as much. In some cases it is better to split if it means keeping your kids safe. And yes those situations are sad and they are hard but sometimes they are the better option. If you stay together just for the kids when you’re not happy, you are hurting your kids by doing that.
It’s very nice to see that daz doesn’t blame the mom or her parenting, he understands that she is just fucking trying her best. She just needed help, she’s alone and she needed help
When I was 5 I bit my sister and my mum made her bite me back and her mum did the same thing to her
How can I subscribe again for gizmò??
what happened to the mom. like did she leave or die?
gizmoo
If my kid ever did that, I would introduce them to a belt.
I can’t imagine doing ANY of this to my mum!! As a kid it was primarily grounding, spanking was an absolute last resort, but it was there and we knew. We knew what our punishments were and why we had them, they were always proportional to our misbehavior, but the greatest punishment to me as a kid was the disappointed mum look. She is a master class judger, never once in my life did she raise her voice. That’s what the mum needed, propotional punishments, as a result, I have never once raised my voice to my mum, and we love each other dearly
Only just watched this one I do feel sorry for some mums they need a massive medal 🥇 I’m suprised  the home hadn’t become haunted the amount of negativity going on  bless her she’s a saint but no more kids 😅
This boy is evil just listen to him he sounds like a devil boy how and why does he hate the menu it sounds lovely  he is horrible i don no but stop  teaching your kid to say bad words teach your kids to say good words not bad words and its  very consurning to hear from this video 😮😮😈👿😈👹👺👻😼
Daammmn. I didn't have the greatest upbringing, nor influences. I was 'raised' mostly on the 'let them bleed' method. "Let her stick a pen in a light socket; she won't do it again." And guess what? I DIDN'T. If I'd climbed on a table, my ass would've got pushed off of it. Woulda been the last time I did that. AGAIN, like I said, not saying that's a GOOD thing to do as a parent, but.... suffice to say I do not have children currently. edit: I knew I was in serious shit when I got three-named. THAT was when I ran lol.
Favorite Parts: 1:22 - “-and Joe Frost is dressed like an IKEA couch.” 3:48 - “Alright, and that’s what you’ll get, you’ll also get my *BOOT!* ” 5:06 “AAAH HE’S BITIN’!”
1:21 ikea couch had me rolling 🤣
The nazis comment 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Daz "I should be supernanny"  Handcuffs.....drop kicks  Me: Yeah seems fair enough
OHHH THAT WAS STRAIGHT IN THE TIT made me laugh 😂 😂😂😂
Daz talks about how Dad's shouldn't leave their children Both of my parents left me
I love what you say and do Daz, and while i agree with the idea that telling people to "Be a Man" is toxic. I believe that it is toxic because of what people have made guys think they need to be. I believe that being a man means to help, and I mean HELP...provide protextion and comfort. But in reality it is both the job of a mother and a fether to provide that. All in all i agree with the idea of just being a responsible person. Wether man or woman, female or male, or lesbian, gay...dosnt matter, we are all people who have a concience. We should use it
10:20 When I was younger, and I would misbehave, my mum had this mat that you’d put on the stairs and it would have a pressure sensor on it, if you got up it would play a loud noise and would stop if you sat back down, the timer was 30 minutes and played a song at the end when the time was up  So much time off my life on that step, It was annoying asf and taught me to  not misbehave if you don’t wanna deal with the consequences
U waterd ur dog 🐕‍🦺🚿
Idc if its 2 years ago mans getting comments from youtube😂
These kids have the behaviour of an npc from hardtime 💀
If I ever behaved like Reece with my mum, I would be six feet under ! xx
Omg this is my first time watching one of Daz’s videos, and I’m not even three minutes in and one of the kids have the same name as me 😭😭😭     Honestly though, he’s fucking hilarious 😂
That’s like me I’m 13 and I am good with everyone else than my mom, my dad abandoned my brother and I so I just live with my mom. Also I have swore at my mom before: tip: NEVER DON’T DO ANYTHING TO YOUR PARENTS!
Hehheslslslapw
What do you mean there was nothing keeping you on the naughty spot? Sheer fear and the knowledge that somehow mum always knew if you even moved an inch kept you rooted to the spot.
Nah for real, my mother did the same thing. I was a biter for some reason. She bit me hard, like teethmarks, no blood or breaking the skin but it hurt like a bitch. Never did it again. Really makes you sort of reevaluate the behaviour once you’ve felt it
1:11 I got my chocolate yogurt and a Actamal is that good
When the dog can look at his owner and his background
I hope the video is good
Nederlands its normol ting we yel cancer
spare the rod and spoil the child , the youth are the wat they are because we don't spank them when they are out of line sorry if you are one of those parent's that just talks to your kid that is like this you are part of the problem you can not let your kid hit you what happens when they get older and they are punching  you   if you allow kid to be violet you are raising a monster in the making  , let me super nanny your kid one day with me and  they would behave if you have kids like this just hit me up ill do it for lunch and some gas money
FUCKING YOUTUBE IN THE COMENT SECTION WHAT THE FUCK
Why was the camera ppl in the lil girls room ?
You make me laugh so hard that I can't breathe
I know your after my following gizmo
I love how he just started the video by saying BIRTH CONTROL!
I love how Reese was just being yelled at while Shannon was straight up locked in a room
Bro my mom would gave me a beating or put her home made hot sauce in my mouth if I bit her
only daz can make a 15 minute video out of a 2 minute vid
Imagine the kids growing up and their mom shows them that episode of super nanny
omg its youtube hii :D
My dad had this thing that for a kid was like the penance stare. And testing it was a death sentence.
wouldnt turning on and off the lights gets the power out??
img
Hello how are you all Type A language You know here 👇 On 11:03
YouTube Is Cool
rewatching old vids. sad day to be a Reese
Get the belt thats all, just get the belt, get the classic alligator skin belt
I was a biter too bit my little brother then my nan and she bit me back i never bit anyone again.
Daz I did those but my sister snitched on me when I flipped her off behind her back but I make faces at her and we laugh😅😅😂😂
Stuff like this, is why pro-choice needs to be kept. Some people love and want children, some don't because they can be little shits.
Those kids would have been put up for adoption already with my parents
10:00
If i acted that way I’d not be commenting now because when you have middle eastern parents then you know they will show no mercy 💀💀💀💀
0:43
Don't have kids. Just don't x
Daz is amazing
The same thing happens with my family my dad is at work all the time so it is always my mom I try not to get in trouble and when my brother is I help my mom I just feel so bad for her doing all of this on her own
1:40 don’t worry about being mean, she’s not a very nice person and is really not clued up about neurodivergent kids
“Jam or ham”  “NOTHING”  I would give him what he wants   Plain bread
My friend and her boyfriend have a lot to
Daz: that’s a good mom Me: even better punching bag
More supernanny
So in your ruby rube video you said you take a short while with the intro and yet you took like 1:20 minutes
Long time yif I was rude to my mum, she would lock me and my brothers in the toilet in the dark 😮
me personally with the youngest kid i would slap it.
I love you daz stay dazzling
THE DOG IS SO SO CUTE 0:18
The naughty step at my house when I was younger was right next to a window
4:26 that was certainly right in the tit
I tried doing the math and these kids are probably in there 20’s now
It is disgusting to say dads running away when TheyHear about pregnancy
AswwQQQQqQan
Daz…😢… I don’t have a cup of tea for this one.. 😣… I’ll have to go without my cup of teaaaa😭
Dawm she has a whole tiny demon💀
The look is to true
MY DAZ MERCH CAME GYREKJDSKBK
He has Kid?
6:38
One and best solution is..   ADOPTION!!
1:47 yeah cue cartman and supernanny getting down to his level or not avoiding his level lmfao
Well ngl the one kid ie The bacon kid/bacon is good for me... if kind of more a humorous mistaken on his part kid XD imho kind of humorous as well.
Lmfao 0:47 or the Movie Idiocracy and the inevitable dumbing ourselves down with microplastics and lead in pacifiers and use in airplanes such as for dusting crops and flying over the top of towns lol vs a lead substitute which luckily is pretty close from what I can find online from research to being imminetnly released.
Cute dog.
at some point you just gotta take a kid to the ring
I think that the kids are in a boxing fight😂😂😂  I;
HE CAN THROW
I grew up in a Mexican household and if I did what the little boy is doing I would be dead right now
I guarantee you the kids are just acting worse because the cameras are there lol😂😂😂
when I was 5 I had the naughty step and I had to say sorry to my mum and I sat there for half an hour and I didn't want to say sorry so I fell asleep!
i laughed out loud on my train
"I DIDNT PINCH HER!!" "I . HIT . HER !"
There was prob 6-12 yr ilds watching this vid and ur talking abt s3x😂😂
There’s a second version of it
14:30 she can allways abort the bastard. If she choose to keep it, then it's not my problem.
“lol I love daz
these kids are demons
And little did he know, in 2 years time he’d be engaged
My mom calls it "Irish twins" when they are a year or a month apart and look alike
11:29 I can’t be the only one who heard “kiss my willy”
If I did that when I was younger my mum would have taken my playstation away or toys away from me if I continued to be bad she would tell me you won't get it back for longer if you misbehave and shocker guess what it works. Might sound harsh but it's definitely a solution.
Bro your dog is cute
I only started watching this and already I'm pissed that the punching and biting kid hasn't had a spank on the butt or a slap on the wrists! Not even the 2 finger pat on the forearm!
These kids don’t need Super Nanny.  They need Father Merin.
Botato 🥔
If I were to embarrass my mom in the store she would wait till I was next to her and secretly pinch me that shi hurt 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Bitten by another mum 😂
Pov: watch a daz watches video for comedy and get a life lesson
you know you're a star when youtube is commenting on your videos
Birth control pills? NAH   supernanny as birth control? YEAHH...
AAAAAAAHHHHHH HE’S BITING got me dying of laughter😂😂😂😂😂
If I would’ve done that I would be buried in the backyard actually no, I would be put in a trash bag then I would be thrown in the backyard and left out to be eaten by animals.
Gizmo!
Daz is British Mully
My mom was the scariest  when she was silent that look wow factory reset with just one look 😂
@iamapickme
I remember when I was in middle school my mom grounded me for like 7 weeks and took away my phone. I remember thinking “you take away my phone I’ll take away your kitchen” then I threw away all her spoons over time
12:06 I should be super nanny  Nah bro your super dazzy
IKEA couch
My mom vs those kids it’s 1,000,000:0 my mom is Eastern European 😭 she’s polish , Russian and also British
The kid:“SHUT UP AND F*** OFF BAS***** “  Daz:“OMG some kids gonna get dropped kicked across the living room” Me: “that brothers floating in the airrrr” 😂 7:49
Daz:“BL-OOD-Y JE-SU-S and the cameras are there as well!” 6:36  😂❤
It makes me sad that no one's talking talking about poor little Casey who's been an absolute saint and tries to help with the little ones 😢
Bro, my band teacher gave me an award for most colorful hair in 8th grade. 11th grade now, and man, that meant a lot.
I'm still shocked Daz is South African
10:28 me and my sister reacted completely differently to the naughty spot or time out, she would just walk away laughing and i was like a little philosopher when i got on that chair, wondering if the guilt would kill me 💀
I have the death stare no spanking or time outs needed. I say something once maybe twice and then it's death stare. Heaven knows what I would have to do if it did not work.
If you ever speak to gizmo in that tone of voice again this aunty is conna come over and  spank you.
daz once said "THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE TIT!"
I watched another episode u did and u told us taht ur daughter but I so u bit her back didn’t do it again ur mother taught u well…
Gizmo is so cute 🥰
bro daz it took me 2 years to realise that you have a boston terrier i never paid ay attention to it
9:57 😅😅
How does Daz make a 15 minute video with a 2 minute video 😭
If you made any of these jokes now you would be shot It sucks
My dogs name is gizmo 🎉
😂😂😂😂😂😂☺️😂dog
Daz has a boston 😱😱😱😱😱😱
my country  is love tea LIthuania 🇱🇹 they love tea they drink it with cookies and biscuits
when i was young a teacher came and yelled in my face and when she finished yelling i made it looked like i was the victom and not her. 😅
3:51 or 3:52 3:53
am i the only one watching this in 2023 thinking that kid would be out the window after the first hit
Anyone else notice hiw she looks like ms Trunchble from Matilda? Maybe thats why he has a weird feeling abt her in the beginning, because she looks like she swung kids around by their pigtails :)
But
I was completely the opposite to Sarah, A devil in school but an angel at home, turns out I had ADHD LOL (obv that’s not the only reason I was diagnosed with ADHD)
An Ikea Couch haha
9:16  mom's death stare 🥶😱
What did Jesus😂
‘Got em all lined up’…. ‘Like little nazis’
I liked your parents' method of discipline when you rebelled against cleaning your room XD no corporal punishment or drama needed. You fucked around and you found out. Badmouthing parents = no playstation. A non-violent consequence for an unacceptable action, and it was effective, you learned!
Why’d no one talking about GIZMO 🤩🤩🤩 these kids are SATEN Mate poor Casey 🥀🥀🥀
Daz your funny as fuck
i love inspirational daz
"why don't you want kids when you grow up?"
I love the fact gizmo is looking at both us and dad at the same time
I say get the belt ready
When you say he's going super saiyan vegeta be like IT'S OVER 9000!
If I acted like that I would be beat by my mother immediately, doesn’t matter if it’s at home, friends house, Walmart. My mother is Mexican if I was disrespectful like that I would be 6 feet under immediately-  probably why I’m so kind now tbh if my mother let me get away with that I’d be a monster
At 10:00 I laughed hysterically 😂😂😂
when i was little i would bite my baby sister’s fingers in the car, one day mum caught me, and told me to bite my own fingers to see how it felt, so i did.. i never bit my sister again.😅
Can I just say u are so funny 😂😂😂 and I love that and I really love your video’s and I don’t even tell my parents I watch this cos of the swearing but I do it any way because I laugh to much 😂😂😂❤❤
Honestly super nanny was just watching “it’s heartbreaking to see her struggle” go help her then
9:50 I’d get drop kicked off that f**kin table damn
4:13 HELP HOW DOES DAZ KNOW THE PAIN THE WOMEN GET WHEN THEY GET HIT IN THE CHEST 😭😭😭😭😭💔
I’d be spanking ass. I got my ass beat when I was a kid if I ever even thought of talking to my mother that way
When did yourube have it's own channel
"PULL MY HAIR BACK AND PUT ME IN BLUE". had me dying😩😂😂😂😂😂
My step-dad is one of those people..I dont know what it is but he's just horrible
Why do I find Daz so entertaining
WHY SHANNON STILL WEARING DIAPERS????
Story time! My mom when i cursed or did something she didn't yell she started to beat the sh-out of me😂😂😂
Ahhhhh he’s biting 😂
Lol ur the funniest 😅
Watching old videos in 2023. Can’t believe I’ve been a fan for like 6 years. Love watching the old videos. Love u daz, you make life worth living
Your actually so real for the middle finger.
That "ah" when the kid bit the mum was in lowercase😭
Sex Ed right here lol
❤❤😂😂
Only daz can make a 2 minute video into a 15 minute video
I would stay in the naughty spot
The kids aren’t bad…it’s the parents neglecting their kid that’s y a lot older kids are TERRIBLE bc they want attention
‘’omg some kids going to get dropkick across the living room” I can’t 😂
And yes before you say I am that Single man with a dog
Ahhhh he’s biting
It's always the dads that are conveniently at work, lol, and the mom is always at her wits end, trying to plead and barter with the spawn of Satan. And then the dad will make an appearance for like ten seconds, standing by the mum as if he's really invested but knowing full well he'd do anything to be at the pub.  That's always been the format, too funny. 🤣
9:19, I laughed.
Daz talking abt the naughty spot reminded me of cartman from that one South Park episode😂
“…and no child has got the better of her” Eric Cartman🧍🏻‍♀️😈
Doesn't help with all kids by doing what they did to you to them.. 😭🤣
I lov daz LMAO he always brings a smile to my face
Iggy
‘She beating the sh!t out of everyone’ -daz

You know there is the option of "BELT"
The mother has a deeper voice than Daz
wait till hes in year 7
The ultimate birth control
The look is so on point😂
One simple trick to fix all these children        Belt.
In my house we had smth called “time out” which is pretty much the equivalent to “the naughty spot” and the only thing keeping me there was my dad saying he would smack me across the face if I got up (it worked very well but also played a part in me now having daddy issues lmao)
Awwwwww gizzy is awesome lmao
Daz im sorry but the spit string when you talked was bothering me and it made me itchy all over
I ain't staying if i get a girl pregnant💀 im gone 14:30
Bro I would let these kids for adoption
the segment of him flipping off his mom as a child had me in literal tears😭
DAZZALING
Slap the kid
Hi
Aww the Boston terrier
Hi
When I was 4 I stabbed my sister with a fork

Cute puppy Daz😍

I WOULDVE GAVE HIM A HEADLOCK
Come to the Balkan and try to curse or hit your parents........boy oh boy
remember that clip where the man is just slapping everyone at the cookout? yeah, that would be me in that room
the mum look is so real 😭😭
when my niece was 4 she would randomly come up to us and hit us full power in the face. my sister then once hit her back (not hard) thats when it stopped lmao
👁👄👁.    👁👄👁.        👁👄👁.     👁👄👁.             👁👄👁      👁👄👁
He saved me

When I was like 3 or something and me and my sister were with a friend Han she had a nanny over. We had fun and we played the floor is lava. While we were playing tag. And she tagged me and I got mad. AND GUES WHAT I DID. I F*CKING BUT HER IN THE A$$ AND SHE SCREAMED I MEAN I WOUKD TOO IF I GOT BITTEN. But anyways and the nanny came and I got yelled at. But yea that’s the everything I wanted to say have a good day/night love y’all!

13:40 Best Advice

oh hey daz \
hey dad this video is rally funny and i hope you ave a good day byeee
im sorry but at 1:42 the cats meow when she nodded at it was the MOST CUTE THING IVE EVER SEEN.
This is insane, poor parenting at it's finest. Far too much of this these days. I bet they're spoilt rotten at Christmas, birthdays etc. My dad wouldn't have tolerated anything like that type of crap. Menu for  kids? Whaaat? There's your tea - eat it! 70s style. None of us (5) have any "ADHD" or other spectrum issues. What has  gone wrong.
Birth control i don't need it i am a man i cant get pregnant 😂cool vid i am a big fan ^_^
That was a plunger
That was a thump
The freaking hell how do you get the shiniest shoe award or a dazzling or what
hi
I have my tea and I hope you have yourse. Me not even drinking warm water.
“She got them all lined up like little natzi’s” 🤣
5:02 IM LOSING ITTTT
I’m a swimming teacher and I agree about to many awards being given, they have brought out a new range of awards called the “I Can Awards” and genuinely they’re blank for the teachers to write in stuff like float on their back, jump in the pool, or even use the ladder to enter the water. It’s insane and makes all the actual awards that require hard work to achieve look so worthless. I also specialise in special needs students and I can see some traits in these children but that doesn’t mean that you treat them any differently than you absolutely have to from a “normal” child.
im glad i was never like this😭
what i did when I was sent to the corner is that I would grab my favourite stuffed animal and all of my blankets and make a nest and fall asleep
my mom would do the look, dad would threaten signing us up from military school you best BELIEVE i was on my best behavior 😭😭
Super nanny didn't always record... She saw me once 😮 I'm not kidding
At 9:55 I thought Reese was about to turn super sayan and avada kedarvara mum
We had a naughty spot at my school in reseption
Bro i can’t believe…                                 Read More
Daz : omg that was right in the tit right in the tit   Daz : i bit my sister not in my 20s 😂 im not mentle (r u sure about that )
12:52 just throw him in the water or you can threaten to do it and then act like you are going to thats a tactic my mum used in my sister
Why did that little boy swear to his mother!!!!!!!!  What the?
DAZ IS THE NEW SUPER NANNY!!!!!!!!
If I were the mum and I just forgot all about being patient and all that the little boy would be the first child to be dropkicked to Neptune and I would be in jail for child abuse
in my old school there (still are they’re just older now) were some kids, they swore at 6 and 7 years old and when I tried to confront the teachers they thought I was lying with my friend 💀💀💀💀💀💀
I think that the two girls are Irish twins
STATISTICALLY KIDS RAISED BY SINGLE MOTHERS ARE THE MOST MISERABLE KIDS THAT BECOME EITHER A CRIMINALS OR DRUG ADDICTS - THANKS FEMINISM!
This is so funny
5:02 " I'm sorry your child bit my son we have to put it down"
9:55
9:15
6:55
5:04 AHHHH HES BITING
daz you did that look a little too well dont do that again ☠
I could cry for Kacey Poor baby
Poor Kacey
Gizmo the dog! That is probably in my top 10 favourite celerities dog names. ❤🐶
In my opinion the only time there should be a nanny is when the parent is out but if you’re not capable to take care of kids don’t have em just my opinion
The one where he said “kiss my Willy” made me die 😂😂
“AHH HE’S BITING” I SAY HE’S BITING THE ASS!😂😂😂
I got a certificate once bc I could talk the most 😂 ph and another one was bc I could whistle
Hmmm, took issue with your comment at about 15mins in. A woman has the right to keep a baby or abort a baby, and consequently has the power to make a man become a father or not become a father, his consent isn’t required. Men don’t have that right. If he simply just isn’t emotionally or personally in the position where he wishes to become a parent, should he not be able to choose, so long as financial obligations are met?
The flipping hulk
My mom would have beat the shiz out of me if i did any of that
i was regularly put on the naughty step and stayed there for hours until i learned my lesson
I never met my dad 😢
My “naughty spot” was mostly enforced by my step-father, he had me standing in a corner with both my hands up and on my tiptoes for at least 7-10 minutes while watching me and shouting at me if I stopped.Might not sound like a lot,but when my muscles got sore it absolutely KILLED me as I was like 7/8 - it didn’t matter if what I did was on accident either.
Did that little boy say “kiss my Willy” 🤨.
You so funny I cried laughing 🤣😂😆
My nickname at school was punching bag until I got promoted turn into a punching and kicking bag good times
my dad also bit me back once, like you said not hard but hard enough to know that I should do it and it sure as hell worked 💀💀
If i was a parent at this moment:  me: You want jam or ham?  hypothetical kid: punches me  me: you want a roundhouse kick or a fucking RKO?
Did someone send a memo out and said everyone must wear BLUEE
when i was 16 i gat my gf pragnent  i wantwd to keep the baby shie did not .
When I was 7 I hit my sister with a baseball bat to the face
I got a certified for not being late to school
daz is one of the best youtubers
I don't think my dad is a fan sorry daz, love your stuff though <3 !!
the dad left for the milk
daz: “this is why you should’nt have kids” sarah: “THAT FENCE DOESNT LOOK TOO SHORT TO LOB YOU OVER IT”
Dej mu šamar pa bo utihni
When i was at the naughty spot i just tried to sleep
kIsS mY wIllY
I know this show from a south park clip 💀
I did accidentally get a girl pregnant at 19 and I jumped at the chance to be a father, now we’re split up and I’m almost constantly with my child(no complaints I love my child but I was surrounded by walls to do majority of the parenting
For fuck sake it’s to 😆 😂
Throw the kids at the wall
It’s called silent treatment
The hell
Gez
As daz makes us laugh, he also gives us live advice about kids, to be honest it was really good advice 😂❤❤
HOLD UP when did daz have a dog
I loved timeouts
Did you get the I’m not angry I’m disappointed look
Absolutely this show is birth control
3:49 at least the boot would be shiny
“Like little nazis”  Best thing daz has said LMAO
😂😂😂😂😂😂
11:27 kiss my what
BEAT. THEM. KIDS
Gizmo is so cute 😭😭🙏
Hi
Shiny shoes 👟👞
I love you daz
I would have give the a slap...
This man my God, he is Hilarious
Cute do daz
Just punch the little one
Chucked that kid in front of that car....
11:15 i like when he said that
8:00 bro turned into shane let me tell you somthn
Anime be like
I’d get a lock and key put the lock on the kitchen door lead all the other kids out and lock him in there 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
has there happened anything to gizmo? his eye is red
Slay
Daz can give the best father advice and life advice in general
Yeah it’s stupid in my opinion if your a man and you get a woman pregnant it is your fault you had sex so you have to deal with whatever happens and lady’s don’t chicken out and just kill yes I said kill the baby all because Oh I wasn’t ready Oh I don’t want a child well tough luck you had sex you deal with the consequences
That kid can throw hands
I remember being young and none of this sh*t ever crossed my mind...
Where’s my belt
My dad left me,!🙂🙂☺️☺️😊😊🥸😕🙁☹️😟😔😭
My mom used to pretend to call the cops on me to stop throwing a fit
bro is funny🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
this literally made my day.
My guy daz is speaking facts about sex ed and parenting I salute you
I would have just slapped the shit out of it, learn real quick.  Won’t have to deal with it either
Satans child got me dying
SHE DIDNT PET THE CAT
i feel bad for casey
I laughed like 1M times 😂😂
havent got tea but i have 5 bottles of water
You say "episodes that weren't brought to air" and it just leaves some fantastical scenarios, doesn't it?  Like, Jo just dropkicks a toddler. Jo burns down the house. Jo has to leave as the kids are taken away cos their uncle was a celebrity in the 80s working for the BBC, there's just so many things your mind can invent!
I need that dog Badly  Its so cute!!!!!!
My daughter received the award for the most “decisive” in her kindergarten graduation, versus the most kindhearted, the most virtuous, the most honest, the most likely to achieve a degree or what not. The teachers assigned each child to a future job. Teacher, architect, scientist, etc. My daughter was assigned… manager. The whole ceremony was cringe. Changed schools after that.  It was so passive aggressive with the way they delivered it. 🤣
When I was a nanny, I had these horrible kids who would basically do the same as these kids. The first week, I considered quitting cause I didn't know if I could do it. But I learned after a while to just take the beating and ignore them. If they'd ask me a question, I'd answer. But never to yelling or screaming. The first month of ignoring them was hard, but eventually, they learned to ask me instead of hit me. After a few more months, we were able to completely stop that behavior. The parents were barely present due to business, but the kids are absolutely amazing now. And I wish I was still a nanny for them.   They felt neglected and unloved, which at their age was incredibly sad. There were 2 kids. 5 and 3. I hope they're doing ok, and I will always be a nanny for them anyday.
That dog 🐺🐶 is so cute 😄
The reason why I actually feel bad for these parents is because my dad, saved me. And he treated me well, and he got a new girlfriend and it’s amazing, but seeing these kids biting, kicking, punching, calling their mom names, is disgusting. Your parents LITERALLY made you, so doing that to the person that made you is confusing, these children make me mad
Bro my names Rhys and my mum always does both them things 😂
"Oh dont worry he dosent bite ☺️" OH BUT HE DOES
I feel so bad for Casie. I underatand how it feels when your siblings just can't just behave, and listen. It is especially draining for a kid to go through that. Not all neglectful family situations happen on purpose, but it doesn't mean that they still can't severely screw up a child's mental state. I wish I could give her and her mom a hug ❤
Rhys " Kiss my willy "   Mum "   "
If I did this with my mother I’d be dead Keep in mind I have a black mom
the dad went to get the milk🥛
Did the 4 year old seriously say kiss my Willy in the super market 😂😂😂
If i was that 4yo’s dad i would have done what my father did to me that made me to this day. Give him a supersayin smack
I’m glad my daughter ain’t like this … mind u my daughter is only 2 weeks 😂😂
Why do you always have you’re headset so weird or is it me
I hate when kids act like brats; my relationship with them involves the exchange of vibe energy. Positive energy forms an understanding with them, but negative energy only equals waining patience and testing my temper. It’s a golden rule every kid needs to know; treat others how you want to be treated
Sad I can't live with my mam😥😭😢
Always makes me laugh 😂😂😂
Right so funny story here so instead if the naughty step or corner i had a naughty girl home when i was 6 and i actually believed it so my mum would just basically take me around eccles till i said sorry bc i obviously would bc it was night time and she said she would leave me there 😂😂 but turns out  she just took me around eccles 😂😂😂😂
My anger issues could never
You know your going be dead when you get the terrifying "mum look"... 😂
5:56 "i thought she was going to turn into Michael Myers or something." BBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHABABABAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHHA IM CRYINNNNN 😭
Another Tara, my mum's called Tara (I am tara Parry's daughter btw!)
Cheers, Daz! I have some tea too!
Daz: And another daz Daz + Me: Watches Me: sssssssssssssssssssss
Thank you so much Daz for giving important information about fathers running away. I truly thank you my mother also appreciates it! It’s actually sad to see my mother being alone.
14:36 watch the right side ?
Aww
if one kid did that to me, I would kick his ass so hard that he would have no more ass to kick
Hooo boy. If I ever acted like this, my ass would be whooped into next century.   Look, I'm all against physical violence towards kids, but I'm sorry, these kids definitely deserve some more sternness.
12:22 - 12:24 (my door has been through worse i have kicked it beyond repair, a piece of it is missing, heck i even punched a hole in my wall
This is why as an asian, I stand by it when I say beating your child is okay.
My mom would kill me
When you called your dog giz for short, it made my day cuz my cat is named gizmo too and i call him giz😂
He threw a fucking dart at his mum!? My mom would have folded me in my clothes and drop kicked me to the moon.  Edit: grammar, not my first language
My brother is crazy for your dog Gizmo
Daz: “PULL MY HAIR BACK AND PUT ME IN BLUE”  Daz’s hair: 🏃💨
DOGGYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY DOGGYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY DOGGYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY  We must have Gizmo Games
I love your videos
Tbh, hitting children, to an extent, is acceptable  bro we all know the look lol
“I am that lonely single man with a dog.” And now he’s engaged! 🥰
I would have hit the kid with a Mortal Kombat fatality finisher if he did that to me
How can Daz go from: “Someone’s gonna get drop-kicked across the living room” To “I just wanna reach  in and help out”
best behaved at of my 2 siblings and i never get that much time with my mum:/
That was a thump ❤😂
Like how my parents raised me,i believe  in child discipline, and these children need discipline.
Hasbulla been real quiet after seeing this
You should watch the one with Megan
what if I did it to a man
i got the same marvel poster daz
omg my mum did the same thing
Super sayan lol
Daz know everything about kids lol
The naughty spot or any kind of time out didn’t work for me I just dissociated and starting playing with my imagination I’m wondering if that was bc I had undiagnosed autism
tell me your a british nanny without telling me your a british nanny
the way daz is so supportive about women being left like that
Idk why but the AAAAH HES BITING!!! Had me sobbing 😭 😂
I only needed my friends little sister to make me not want kids :> (shes *loud* and *clingy* and *annoying*
i got an award back in elementary school for asking too many questions. pretty sure every teacher hated me 💀
gizmo: ⬅️👁️            👁️➡️                            👃                              👄
Dazstop
You know those little baby harnesses
daz!! you look so much happier
“There’s Reese playing her up” kinda sounds like “ Theirs rizz playing her up” I’m sorry I had to say it i just had to…
The whole time that kid was hitting his mum, I was like, "DISAPLINE HIM!!!!! DISAPLINE HIM!!!!"
Daz is my therapy
pov black people: 😲
My parents made me stand in the corner for like 1-60 based on how bad I was but it was the corner write next to the door so when our farm workers came in they would se my dumb a$$ crying in a corner and it embarrassed me a lot as a 6 year old cause I always tried to be cool and show of in front of theam and that wold just crush me 😂
I was put in a corner full of cob webs😂
That mom stare thats when you know you are fucked
11:10 when i was a kid and got put on the naughty step i got my family to get on there as well and  said it was bus stop..never got put there again
Slap them It'll fix everything
That cat wanted nothing to do with her, in the first few seconds.
So adorable. Doggie cute.
“Got them all lined up like little nazis”😂
Ankle bites
“ I was afraid she was going to turn into micheal myers” love that fr
*Be A Man Is No Such Thing*  One of the best quotes form a legend  -Daz Black
I was brought up with the naughty spot but either my mum or someone else (an adult) would watch me
i hate america we have to wake up for school at 7:00 or sometimes 6:00. i just wanna sleep man :(
Dazs Dog.  look so cute
Daz the dad went to go get the milk
I'm your biggest fan I watch your videos every single day you are so funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅
I pooped in my car and I was like what I did was poop
Casy the bad bich
9:17 this is the look my mum gives me if i dont do what she says she’s pulling out the Arabian slipper
The MMA family aint no way the mother survived after the show
GIZMO FROM SALLY FACE
my mum did the exact same thing
I’m still wondering if Gizmo has a social media account Daz posts on or does he put pictures of Gizmo on his often because I’m curious
Nice
Daz: before u say yes I Am that single man with a bog eyed dog  😂😂 (I'm joking  about that dog bit)
Sorry but idk I would hit that kid the kid DEFINITELY deserves that
I'm from a military house, I now have three brothers and live with two of them and my mum, gods know we would give Super Nanny a bloody challenge... My poor mum, my older brother was violent, my younger brother was babied and I was stuck in the middle, both being forced to do all the chores my brothers wouldn't want to do, going to school, and being the emotional punching bag... My family was a god damn nightmare
If I acted like that I would have gotten a smack and locked in an empty room
Gizmo + Daz= gaz😂😂😂
Bro I got 39 damn ads through this whole thing
favorite 8:22
My girlfriend got pregnant even though it was an accident and protection was used and I had a bit of a proud moment when he said dont run away and leave the girl to deal with it because I didn't, I stuck around
Kid thinks he is suarez
Fucking hate children with a passion god babies crying n plane is worst hours of blasted annoyance dam it and can’t say anything about it
That kid mortal Kombat 😂
They’ll all grow up and realise how bad they were and would probably feel bad about it later we all do this and I’ve allways been attracted to joe frost supernanny she can be my nanny and disipline me anyday tell me off in those clothes you know or off you know hot🤪
lol😂😂
Did I just hear the child say "kiss my willy"-
My mom had to kneel on a vent! With her hands in the air when she was a kid. I acted up once! That’s what she made me do I never talked back again my knees actually got cut open and my knees where black and blue and purple for 2 month
Lil kid really said kiss my wille
''and jo frost is dressed like an ikea couch'' DIEING
If my kid was trying to punch me and shit I'm spanking the fuck out of them
Daz you should watch   world’s strictest parents
It’s a shame some young teenage girls will not listen they get pregnant then they complain oh I’m not ready oh I can’t handle this well though luck sweetie you had sex that young that’s what you get
No one will get control of me mwahahaha 😏
He's single and has a daughter
the day before the last day of school all the 5th grade classes were practicing the ceramony and my teacher was saying diffrent awards wich were not the actual awards but when he said my name he said best door holder because i always held the door
When Daz said to bite him that’s exactly what the mom of my step son said to do and I could never bring myself to do it. I’m sure she did though and that’s probably why he stopped biting me Lmao
273K
All she needs to do is drug the shit out of them and make them feel good
Bro I’m laughing so hard
DAZ WACH MORE 😂😂😂
9:14 YESS
I have a nickname for every age of child: 1-3=toddler, 4-11=Jizz goblins (Jizzlings for short), 12-14="Depressed" Edgy ass twat 15-17=kinda ok
God why do the kids remind me of my self back when I wasn’t diagnosed for adhd
You can be a good friend to your life with you too and you have nobody else in the way home you can get it from you or you are both good and I have a good time and I have a good time and you are both great to be together with your dad but I don’t know what happened but I’m not not going to do this but I will be praying for you this week so we can get a new one and I have to go
Jar
stop pausing it bro
They must’ve been some very dazzling shoes
Honestly, put the 4 yo up for adoption
If I did that to my mum I would be in the ground😂
Growing up, every time my parents put me in the corner I would tear up their wallpaper. Pissed them off so bad 😅
That's so good that Daz tells little boys that watch his show to not run off when he made someone pregnant cuz i alot of young boys loop up to him i honestly think he is the best YouTube ever  ❤
Ha and he swats her tits
.. hey uh , lady? not to late for abortion...
my doggo died an hour ago :(
If my kids acted like that i would smack them and aggressively drag them to their room and block or lock the door so they cant leave
i feel so bad for the mom
Holy fuck😂
1 2 buckle my shoe 3 4 buckle some more 5 6 Nikei kicks
i would only hire daz to teach my kids how to act💀💀
My friends dogs name is gizmo
the way if i acted like the little boy my mom would be done popped me multiple times..
React to more of these videos
we need anakin on the bad children

Drop kick to the moon
10:00 super saiyan Daz

2:31 LMAO
I got iced tea is that good enough Daz? Sure hope so
Oh my God the dog is so cute
Daz:  Is there no surface left where is something pinned on it!!!   Dazzes background : uhh hello??!! 😂😂😂
My parents keep us under control using unnoticed generational trauma :D
I love Gizmo :3
Bloody Jesus 😂😂
The camera man a survivor
6:50 THATS HOW I GET MUMS ATTENTION I RELOCATE HER JAW-
My mum said if I move I’d be killed
7:20  no Æ-
7:22 that cut scre made laugh😂
My brother would leave scars on me from his bites or him throwing things at me.
Omg your dog is so cuteeee ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Super nanny is wired because on the show a dad is mean to an emo kid.
I watch super nanny and I still want 18 children that’s just me😅
your dog wanted a shoutout well SHOUTOUT TO UR DOG
*The parent death stare* means: ``GET THE F#&^ TO YOUR ROOM`` XD
If I ever did that to my mum or dad I would be shaking hands with the grim reaper because it’s the end of my time 😂
Daz says BITE HIM
shinest shoes where they daziling
Supernanny is like Nanny McPhee
Did he say kiss my willy 😂😂😂
the dog here me out
I’m not sure if it was me or somehting but I heard the youngest kid say “kiss my Willy” 11:27-11:30
Daz: “ okay that’s what you’ll get, you’ll also get my BOOT” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
8:43 my mum:
The “mum look” I’d say is the most terrifying thing ever to happen to you
for me it was "oh she has them lined up.... like little Nazi's!" 🤣🤣
POV the cameraman is invisible
These episodes of Super Nanny makes me not want to have kids, who’s with me?
TEA
Soooo the problem is that everyone is so scared of child protective services these days. You smack those kids! If they got spanked they would be scared to do it again! Simple as that!!! We need to advocate for parents to discipline their kids in a healthy way so they don’t become violent adults in the future!!!! We gotta nip that shit in the bud!!!
Why would he not want to be in the show If he was around other than cause other women he seeing.
How does Daz make a 2:11 vid 15:42
Daz the kid Reesie said kiss my Willy
This is so funny
13:44 is the sweetest thing 😕 because he is right
I love your videos❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤but de kid is de boxer😅😂
If the kids were spanked this behaviour will stop
I love Gizmo!
To be fair, to me Jo doesn't look like a nanny. Rather like a social worker ready to take the kids away at any given moment😅
I remember getting put on the naughty step and being to traumatised to move and my parents were having dinner in the other room
In school i got the polar bear award cause i always wore my coat even in the summer i was a weird autistic child
8:58 😮😮😮😮😮😂😂😂😂😂😂 FACTS
Tou moron daz
The mum wants to be dead Very hard to handle three kids
Listen if I ever talk to my mum like that she will take a and a broom and spank the f out of me
My child would catch these hands. Rated E for everyone lol 😂
the shiniest shoes omg that happened to me once when i was in year 4 they gave me a reward for having the most nose bleeds in english and everyone kept on thinking i was alorgic to english
Daz: *BIRTH CONTROL* we use it when we don’t want kids.  The dose I’m on for mine is low enough that it helps my period hormones be not as bad, and it doesn’t work as an actual contraceptive, but I also never want kids, so supernanny is the superior birth control
Just give him bread
What breed is Gizmo? I must have it
Bruh i wish my dad saw this video before i was born💀
Am I the only one who was like they could be twins one could have been born at 23:59 and the other at 00:01 4:39 4:39 4:40
My mom used the naughty spot. Everytime i left, she would drag me back, add a minute and the timer would start over. Worked on me. Also my mom is Greek wich is the scariest varient of mother that exists.
When I was a teen I used to watch Supernanny with my mum. I think Daz is right about this show putting you off having kids. I was in my late teens when I told my parents if they wanted to be grandparents, they'd have to rely on my sisters and brother lol
This is a good quote for a yearbook 13:48-14:58
i knew that if i moved outta the timeout corner id be there until i stopped crying,talking and moving☠ and daz is so right about the mom look, iknew and still do know that if i talkback or cop additude i would get the look and would shut up as soon as i saw the look☠😂😭
I like in Brassington avenue
Bruh
The kid once said Shut up big freckle!!!!! 😂😂
imagine if the nanny just came in with a pan and just smacked the shit outta the kids 💀
When i was younger and hisbehaved i had the "naughty step" for not eating my dinner it was either bacon and cabbage or stew  edit: 7 years later ive come to love both dinners  +  the naughty step was the first step and i remeber running up the stairs to escape my parents. I also had bigbrain couse i had a door stopper so i jammed it under the door when it was closed so they couldent get in lol i have nastalgia just thinking of it
that dog looking like that rango dude from the fever dream of a disney movie wtf his pupils are in different time zones😂😂

Get out the naughty marksman and they'll be quiet :)
Hi there
My mum gave me the death look

I’m going to be back
I love jo soooo much
Inspirational
i heard jam or ham🤣😂🤣😂
One day in elementary i got a certificate for bieng the most annoying child and i did it on purpose.
the reason i dont want kids bc i will just smack the shit out of it.

bro daz gives us all better advice then probably a lot of fathers, kudos man we love ya <3
19:17 my mum just does straight eye contact and it’s terrific
7:48  the MEME
Mum: stop it  4 year old: kiss my will-

Easiest ways to solve the problem: 1.            *orphanage*

Daz is my dad
DAZZING SHOES
Daz I am you biggest fan I watch you everyday I just wanted to let you know I have a Boston terrier as well
does anyone else agrees Daz should be the new super nanny if so click Tehe 👇
im called reece
As a teenager I would always ask my mom if I ever screamed or yelled, No she said I was quiet for 4 years meanwhile, my brother would yell and scream but he has autism and that makes sense. The way my mom just says "Oh yeah, You were quiet like Very quiet, your brother not so much but I saw the reason why" just made me think "Huh"   Moms sacrifice everything for you and your siblings love them and think of how they do no matter what to keep you happy❤
I've watered you
T￼
The 7 year old just takes the nanny's bag off the side 🤣
super nanny ❌ SUPER DAZZER✅
to Daz, i guess, birth control didn't work with your mum, she end up have you, poor  mum
Growing up, never thought about striking my mother. Maybe because I wanted to survive my childhood. Anyway, it still shocks me seeing a child hit and kick their parent.😂
what epsiode is this
Super nanny be like 👁👄👁 when the kid hits his mum
was that kid calling his mum a faggot at 10:11?
As an American (and I mean no offense by what I’m about to say) the idea of a stranger raising me just seems odd. I’m not bashing nanny’s or people that hire them, it’s just very strange to me.   I love the fact that when I got out of school my mom picked me up or I walked home and she was there for me. My dad was a career military man and I’m thankful or what he did for me I love him to death. But work is work and he couldn’t always be there. Knowing that me and my little brother always had each other and out mom meant the world to me.   I couldn’t imagine anyone that could take the place of one of my parents because there’s no way they could. They brought me into this world because they wanted to and because they love each other.   Call me a trad or old fashioned it I think it’s best if there always a parent home with the child. That doesn’t mean a parent can’t work. They could do part time while the kids in school or work from home.   Nothing compares to coming home to a person that gave you life and the love they give.
my angry ass could not work as supernanny i'd end up punching those children
if my parents ever saw us or heard we'd acted this way I would be sprawled across the living room floor.
SIDERANT a few days ago i did some jobs at my aunties house and got €30 and 50 Zloty (polish money cuz i was going to poland in a few days) and when i got back home i had my money in my bag and i was in my room for the rest of the day WITH MY BAG then my brither came in and told me that my mum stole all my money and he managed to get the €20 back so i thought he was lying so i checked my bag and it was gone. HOW THE SHIT? So i went into my mums room and got the €10 back but she stole my 50 zloty that i was gonna use to buy some makeup there cuz they have this brand thags super pretty, BUT HOWWWWWWWWWW!!!????
when i'm mad at my parents, i take long hot showers so they don't have any hot water 😈
Yes
Someone obviously got this woman pregnant so where is the man because how else would it happen
Bloody Jesus
This is why every child needs a dad
Is that youTube?????????!??😮😮😮
They was right when they said dogs look like they’re owners💀💀
Basically this whole video was daz talking and explaining why not to have kids
There isn’t a thought in that dogs brain! 😂😂
The girl had to think about her age oh bless her
My little brother has been cussing us out for years now. It’s horrible, like 20x worse than that kid and my little brother is 6 yrs old. He cusses at literally everything and tells us to stfu, and all these other horrible things. And my older brother taught him the n word, when were white which I think is wrong on so many levels.
The doors on life support 💀
Hey Daz, I know you all not see this but I have a Boston named Lilly and she almost looks like your pup. All I was saying was your pup is one of the prettier ones.
“I gave you water” ❌ “I watered you” ✅
Superdazzy Coming To Dazzlers Screens Soon!
If I ever had a kid like that I would get my point across to show that if you mess with me you would regret it immediately.
I don’t have my tea but I have my cheese
Love your dog dazz Wher can I cop the cap 🧢 pls 😊
Gizz why u looking so Sad today  Wholesome content
My dad doesn't even pay child support💀. Luckily I have a stepdad now who is more of a father than my actual dad ever was
If my kids were like that I’d lose my temper
I have never wanted punt a child sooo bad, I have a 1 year old sister and 2 year old brother, they both have biting and hitting issues

Those people should get surgery done get they’re legs and arms removed or something.
Im surprised how I’m not 6 foot under the ground in a wooden box yet
That reecy would be unalive if I was dad
He is cute
I would slap the absolute shit out of that 4 year old
GIZMO GAMES
My mother got pregnant from my brother's dad and she thought she had to marry him and he was a full douchebag but she married him because she was pregnant with my brother but since he was a bad person he was a terrible husband to my mom and she divorced him and told me if I get a girl pregnant you don't have to marry her what do you have to say about that since you were talking about the topic about dad's and husband's
Bro is like cartman.
6:03
Your sentence shortened or freedom!!?😂😂
ya know i'm 15 so i don't have kids but i do the silent stare thing with annoying kids in school lol
What about linda?
my mam would of leathered me
...this is why I want to chemically castrate myself. I would be hitting kids so quickly
Is anyone gonna talk about gizmo.and the intro with him it was so funny
12:16 why’d she say that like a video game boss
The dog is adorable
4 year old kid is like the owner
I remember the mum look , and our mum would say your name a few times then it was first and middle name we never let her get to your full name cause that was certain death
My mum left me she took drugs
your so addictive
My six year old brother called the oldest brother(Jake)a d!ck head and all my siblings where in the room it was hilarious Jake look at him and said “what Did you say?” Everyone started laughing because we know he was in trouble it was really funny
10:00 super saiyan Daz
daz you said ''how's if going dazzlers🤣😂😂😅🤣😆😆
Little natzis ✨
I know its and old video but I never got the naught spot I had to keep a quarter on the wall using my nose and if it dropped I got more time
My mum and I would always watch it and my mum would sa “that was. Exactly how u used to me 😅” …
These kids were BORN BY SATAN GEEZ
This kid is Eric cartman but he's 4
If I smacked my parents growing up....I'd no longer have usable arms...or legs probably...
Did he say “ kiss my Willy “ when he was in the cart? 😭
LINDA HES AT IT AGAIN!!! linda o god
11:27 "kiss mah wiley" 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
My mom expressed this😢😮
Personally, I would have drop-kicked Rhys, and punched theother one square on the nose. If I were a mother I'd take no sh**
nanny 911
Daz: youre after my followers gizmo. I can see it in your eyes.  Gizmo: *not a thought behind those eyes*
My mum looked at me once with that look I started crying 😂😂😂
WAIT I JUST REALISED FROM A YEAR AGO THEY WENT TO MY SAME PRIMARY SKL????!!!!!!!!!
That’s a cute dog
“Lined up like little nazis” I fucking lost it
Lined up like nazi's 😂
who tf is called shannon just imagion lol0olololooloplol
their called irish twins i have one it means their less then 1 year apart
bruh if me and my other two siblings did this to our african mother.... jesus christ she would beat the hell out of us-
Daz is just like “FUCKING KIDS”
The camera man: 0                                  I                                [    ] "Yeah Ill just stand here
My mum used to bite me as well😭 and one time I bit her on the tit and I thought I was never going to see the light of day ever again
omg god 😲
That child got stage fourteen rabies I swear, he doesn’t want a sandwich, he wants MOTHER
I’m three months pregnant and watching these videos I’m just like “😀put this bitch. In the. CORNER!” I have a chair for my child. It’s just a wooden chair that faces the wall in the corner.
I jusy CHOKED ON MY WATER, and now my bedroom IS A SWIMMING POOL BECAUSE YOU SAID * and i quote * “To relocate her jawline”
Chomp 😢
"Their all lined up, like little n@zies"-daz 2022
One time they were handing out certificates to my class and I got one one for being the class clown
My mum did the biting thing to me
Mum: no   Kid: AHHH-
I would beat the bricks off my daughter if she did this some kids can’t be gentle parented sometimes you just got to slap them one good time
I've got adhd so I'm like that sometimes but I don't smack my mom/dad
Your the funniest youtuber
I love that dog
my mom would bite my uncle's back, and then blame it on him.
I was wearing blue while watching this😅😅
those kids need to CALM DOWN AND STOP STRESSING THEIR MOTHER OUT JESUS CHRIST
She called super nanny instead of the military school?!
IM SORRY BUT HOW DOES THE CAMARA MAN EVEN MANAGE THIS JOB😭😃
He is so funny
It was a pen with fluf on the end.
PLEASE do a Supernanny skit! It'd be so funny!
parenting is really bad nowadays beacuse the law states that you cant discipline your kids as far as any parent should be concerned you can discipline your children because there is a fine line between discipline and assaulting your children be tough or they will never learn
bro cleans his shoes with mr.clean
If my kid was being violent run then you should take them to the doctors bc they might have bipolar or schizophrenia
Cute puppo
7:48 I’m pretty sure my soul left my body because if I’d even thought of saying that my dad would’ve chased me into my bedroom before pulling my trousers down and slapping some manners into me. Also the stern look is so accurate it’s scary 😂
All I gotta say is jab jab jab upper cut
despite Daz being a comedy youtuber, I love how he can be super professional too in certain situations.
These white kids are so confusing to me, growing up in a Asian country- I guarantee u won’t find kids like this. A few good thumps will fix them ez
Brooo I actually had tea drinking it 😂😂😂
8:26 😂😂
The mum who is taking your kids food shopping little tip go shopping while kids at school im a mum to 4 and thats what i do its so much esayer and alot less stress
I love how Daz can make a 3 min video into a 15 min video-
I could rly do for some tea rn. I'm very sick ;v;
THATS THEE LOOKKKKkKk my mom does it toooooaoahhhhhh
Like little nAnCysss✨✨✨✨
Daz: if you get a girl pregnant..  Me a trans man: I mEAn I cAn tRY   (Update) this comment is so much better now bc I'm gay 😂
Is your dog named guess 🐶🐕
daz is the wisest person i've ever seen and no one will change that
when he was on the table i would have pushed that fucker off it.
I feel so bad for the mom 😢
I was put on the step and I would just climb up and down the  stairs
your dog is so cute😭
Kid: SHUT UP ! Mom: NO ! Well, you showed him 😂 Jesus
One time I got in trouble and when I was younger I was really fat, so my mom said for me to run up and down the stairs 44 times. And she was standing at the bottom of the stairs watching me. But I thought it was funny, and then my siblings joined in too and we were laughing and eventually my mom did too and she took off the punishment 🤷‍♀️ 💀
“They’re lined up like little nazis🥰”
Joe frost  Daz: joe frost is dressed like an ikea couch 🤣🤣
If I did ANYTHING that these kids did, I'd be popped on the cheek, whooped, literally ANYTHING bad would be put back into place
Also when I get taken to the naughty spot/the stairs I enjoy it because I think of things! Also I once said if I do it again I'm reading a book XD
I KNOW WHAT THE UNIFORM THE SCHOOL IS FROM A AUTISTIC ONE.AND I KNOW QHAT BECAUSE OF MEH BROTHERR:D
Ok sign of the times. One of my littles punched me in the leg and her three sisters laughed.... I looked her straight in the face and calmly said " no" and turned off the internet in the house. You would have thought I had lite their favorite cat in fire.
That little boy when he was in the shopping cart at the store, said kiss my Willy😮
I'll get him castrated that will serve him write
Bro I have a stern mom the look is so relatable
Are we all ignoring how adorable giz is
0:02 is that Iggy???
Why not even a minute into that video and it’s been At least 10 minutes
" A kid's getting dropkicked across the living room"🤣. I'm crying rn
💩
The mum sounds like a chav  so I'm not surprised  her kids are like that she raised them like that
When u said u got a certificate for the shiniest shoes i remember in collage i got a certificate for having colorful hair even tho i passed everything i still got a certificate for something stupidly funny.
Jizzmo
Would anyone just punt they 2 misbehaving kids into a river and then keep the well behaved one?
DATS NAUGHTEH HAD ME ON THE FLOOR
Well said about being a man bro, I’ve been a single dad for 7 years and still going
I’m eating ice creams😂
8:23 that's gonna be on reddit anytime soon 10:00 that too

This is why I won't be a good mum.  I'd throw that kid across the room so hard.
13:47 daz is really the sweetest in here lmao
Okay I know about the crazy video but can we just talk about how wholesome the start was ❤️
“They’re all lined up like nazis.” DazGames
There is always this simple solution: anti baby pillen
Why are her cloths gold

Genus crise!!!!!!
THE MUM LOOK IS WHAT MADE ME A GOOD KID BECAUSE IT REALLY WAS TERRIFYING
Believe it or not but these are my cousins
I'm sorry but my anger issues could neverrrr
you should be a stand up comedian
girl goes to punch mum: daz; “BLOD DY JE SUS”
Many fathers don't understand the impact their consistent presence has on their kids lives. My younger half siblings grew up with our dad and I didn't we've had completely different upbringings and it's hard to see others get what you wanted so bad.
He is cut your dog
Daz cool
I watched super nanny religiously when I was around 6-7yrs old. Now I’m gay & don’t want kids : )
Gizmo is adorable 😍
my mum used the slipper for punishment, i must say, it worked T-T
My mom have me that look one time and it scared me to death and never misbehaved again after that.
imagine the mum(or mom) know's karate  the neighbours  all they hear *SMACK* *BANG* *THUD*
Daz games is the second super nanny literally he’s so good ❤❤
Their lined up like little Nazis 😂💀
Daz: Alright and that's what you'll get, you'll also get my BOOT!  I laughed so hard at that part! 😂
Aw I love Boston terrior's there so cute my gramma has one. 😍
You know your cool when YouTube says your shoes are dazzling
Daz is the person I come to when I have nothing to watch always brightens up my day stay dazzling daz🤗
Gizmo is so precious!!  9:03 I'm surprised you're still alive! lol
" OOOOH THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE TIT ..... RIGHT IN THE TIT " that had me cracked up 😂😂😂😂
no mom have ever bested her. Excuse me but have you ever seen southpark????
That's how I get her attention by relocating her jaw🤣
My school gave me an award for fucking sleeping in class
Watch dhar man pls
well daz  my mum died so what do men do when thay are left alon
Daz: "Yes I am that lonely single man with a dog"  Me: "Don't worry Daz, I'm that lonely single man with a cactus" :(
THATS NAWTY
In my wchool they had the best ass certificate 🤣
Bro hitting his mom over a fucking sandwich
cute dog
Please do some more of these PLEASE 🤣
Daz blaming the men but what happens if the bloke is in prison or the mother if the child stops them from seeing them
i havent drunk tea in like 5 year like a dull cup i sip some from my mum bit i havent had it since year 6 and im in year 11
I know that freaking look I always get that look from my mum
Wait how do you water a dog
If I acted like that when I was a kid,  nobody would know that I ever existed.
If I uttered one cuss word at my mother when I was little (ages 5-12) I would’ve ceased to exist. Sorry mom I learn this language from you, my uncle, my grandma, and the rap music my aunt listens too.
Daz says that everything has something pined to it  Me: looks at his room hmm yes
If I did that to my mom she would beat me with a pan😂😂😂😂
I would drop those kids faster then you can say ah
What episode and season is this?
I would drop kick the kid off the table
Daz being an inspirational father figure❤🫶🏻
Bro I was eating ramen when I was watching this and the nooooddles were FLYING OUT OF MY MOUTH IT WAS THAT FUNNY ❤ DAZ I LOOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!❤❤
A man should never just get up and leave, but I also think a woman should never just dropped the child on the father and just never come back
Pause the video and go to 10:01
The 4 year old called her a f@t f*cker I was shook
Damn I know that mom look very well 😭😭
That kids tiny Hannibal Lecter
This is why my dad owns a belt
he is such a good role model for everyone absolutely everyone
Daz:makes videos Me: he should be a therapist
If I had kids and they did that to me they would be a human punching bag
IKEA COUCH LMAO
Rhys swearing, acting, hitting, fighting and tantrum just like of Taken movie
They be cripn 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Your the most funny YouTube I've seen. I love your videos
“Deviants into delights” oh don’t you mean “delights into deviants.”
*jojo watching this* ‘Did he just call me a curtain’ Fun fact: I used to bite a kid my mom fosterd I was 2-3 the the girls name is molly !
1:43 "and no child has ever got the better of her... BAA-"
I LOVE THE DOG ❤
Danm we got the next mike Tyson here!
Omg I love gizmo
Fun fact about handcuffs whenever I was in trouble as a kid my dad would handcuff me to the pool fence and leave me out there all night
the dad did not come back with the milk
14:20 what’s this about? How is ‘being a man’ a toxic saying? Being a man means protecting your loved ones, standing up for what you believe in and working hard. Please educate me in how that is toxic.
i honestly feel so bad for the oldest kid. shes realised she cant get as much attention as the others and is just trying to make her mums life easier. respect to her.
`i ve got my tea i hope u have` thats had me laughing for days
Bro those kids are feral
Dad should be the nanny bro I would love to see him 😭
I love the dog
child=satan
My mother would have told all thos women to just stop being nice and a bitch and beat their ass. Me and my siblings never got whipped because my mom told us from the begining to respect her and to not do dumb shit to get thrown out the window. If we did fuck up, we got a long, cold, stare of shame and "your lucky I love you" stare. Some people need to understand that your kids aren't your friend, their your offspring and you need to have control over them. If they are mentally challenged or something else is going on, I can see why they haven't done that yet. I'm just saying there are times when you should just give them the backhand and put them in line. I come from a black household so hopefully this makes sense.
Awwww that was so sad that this woman hasn't got anyone to help her I feel sorry for how that mother is stressed
they need some good polish discipline
Freaking pop him
LMAO.. I've always said to my coworkers... Hear that child screaming, that's enough birth control for me. SH*T!
8:04 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When we got sent to thebad spot it's like my dad would sit at the top of the couch where he could see us, and if we tried to get up, he would yell at us to sit back down and we would just sit there until he said, go get dinner so yeah😅😅
If that was my kid ohhhh this is what I would do 🙋🏻‍♂️🤦🏻just 100x more hard
There is no way that Rhys isn't either autistic or neurodivergent, he was clearly dealing with sensory overload. It was such a crowded house anyway, and yelling at him wasn't helpful at all, and even made it worse. I don't blame Rhys fully - he was 4 - but the mother yelling quite literally in his face was just overstimulating him more and escalating the situation. That got a tad ranty, I'm sorry
They just aggravate it for the show.
When daz said he flipped his mom off once I did to I couldn’t sit for 3 weeks
This reminds me of my Christmas play where Santa watched too much super nanny😂😂😂😂
That was so sweet of Daz said he wanted to reach into the video and help
Lol
My mum done that to me
“And Jo is dressed like an ikea couch”  (Idk how u spell her name srry)  “Oh god these kids are SATAN”  “Oh my god some kids are gonna get dropkicked to the living room”
This is why people should beat their kids sometimes
the way  that the 4 year old just jumped on the table he acted like he is goku XD
It was so cute when Daz and Gizmo joined heads mannn
OMG DAZ UR AMAZING AND FUNNY  U  CRACK ME UP
Men need to learn from this amazing man. STOP LISTENING TO @NDREW T@TE!!!!
U r nor wrong with ur mum bit
Love ❤ Supernanny!!! You so beautifully
She’s not wearing bike pants! Under that skirt
@Youtube who uses/owns the YouTube account
When I was naughty my mum would put me on the naughty step ( the bottom step) and I would have to wait depending on how old I was so when I was 10 I would have to wait for 10 minutes before I could go and play again. Once my sister head butted our tv and she had to stay on the naughty step for longer than her age and I found it funny because what I remember is her going toward the tv like a rhino head first, and my mum was so furious with her.
never to late for an abortion
My dad did the same thing with lightly biting me on the hand I never bit again
When daz said "ohh bless her heart"  My southern self went "DAZ? WTH that's rude" but he actually ment bless her heart not "bless her heart"
You are HILARIOUS. Why am I not subbed to you yet? I will rectify this immediately.
My Latina mom would have them fixed in a day
I can’t have kids cause I know I’d slap a child.
Joe standing there like a statue or like she’s in some edit or something most of the time 😂
The kids were probably told by the parents “super nanny is coming to sort you out soon etc etc”
9:16 And that’s when you know your fucked lol I’d do everything to stop getting beat
As an individual with psychological knowledge, it is very, very normal for children to push boundaries, break rules, and even become violent. It is when they become argumentative, defiant, or even violent around authority, peers, and pretty much towards everyone in their life that they may require psychiatric evaluation for Oppositional Defiant Disorder or Conduct Disorder.
Wow
Did any hear on 11:28 where he said kiss my will….. 😂😂😂
My mum and dad have me and five other kids
Can i say kacey went into taras bag😂😂😂😂😂
I would smack the siht out of him
I need to know if this is cruel or genius, lock them in the basement for 10-15 minutes with the lights off, they'd be terrified and would never do anything again. Pretty sure it's cruel but it's just an idea
Please react to the Cameron episode
I'm your biggest fan
Istg if I did that to my mum I would be dead 😭😭
they act like that bc  there parents act like that and sward all the time they have bad parents
Dont run off, man...just Abortion
we need more Gizmo, he's adorable! He's one of those dogs you want to just hold close to you and just pet aggressively (but safely- I SWEAR I'M NOT HITTING DOGS-)
Even the most basic ones are like hahaha
Noooooops
Pov: 04:36 me when i know im right
I love gizmo
Gizmo is sooooo cute
No offence but if ur mum was biting u she was probably mentally ill
She needs to give a good smack on her children
0:18 omg pls let us know how giz is doing he hasn’t been in any other videos 🥰
6:34 i spit at my phone my accident because how pissed of i was
My issue with super nanny is that sometimes the child isn't misbehaved or evil, they're just neurodivergent and it's so annoying as an autistic and adhd person bc the child's needs aren't being met and instead of "fixing" the child she's just traumatizing them.  Edit: Although if the children are actual brats, they deserve to be taught to stop.
this is so sad to see i feel terrible for the young girl and mum
The camera man is like "good job guys good job"
The problem with the mother is that she doesn’t ever punish them, she just says “You’re being naughty.” And then she just continues to let Reese’s pieces torment her when she is clearly more powerful. She just never uses her power as the mother when she obv should. Blessings to her though. She needs it to ward off these demonic children.
the mom stair is so true
Bro that dog ain’t a dog its iggy   jojo reference?😂
The only time my son's sperm donar saw him in person, my son was a baby. He passed by my son in his stroller and my mom, on a court date for child support. And the only time he has paid child support was bc government said he had to pay a certain amount, or go to jail, which use to happen every 6 months. Wish he would grow up, be a man and take care of his son. I would be happy if he even just acted like his dad without the child support.
Put it down
When I was like I think 5 we didn't call it the naughty spot we called it the naughty corner it was in front the front door so the floor was insanely creaky never dared to leave it.
Daz: i have my tea and I hope you have too    Literally nobody:  Me: no cuz it TWO in the friggin morning
WHY IS THE DOG SO DAMN CUTE
Saying no frost was dressed like an ikea cough got me spitting out my drink and all ways breaking my chair
?
My mum has 6 kids
She'd be FUC*ED with my siblings
I would've bloody booted that kid so far and quick you would never see him again
Lucky my sister bit me and I thought she ate my finger it felt like a mini chainsaw
I will beat the soul out of them
I like it how super nanny just stands there and just doesn't do anything while the mum just deals with her 3 kids.Super nanny's supposed to be a babysitter and she just stands there telling the camera how naughty the kids are
Mom: you’re rude  My dumbass mind thinking she said “your a road” 😂
me just watching Daz:BIRTH CONTROL
If I had a kid like that I he would be 6 feet under
Funniest bit for me 9:59
he messed up flipping her of he could of died
isnt daz a nonce ?
"Pull my hair back and put me in blue now"  He'll make the best nanny because of his boot XD
😭😭😭help-
3:29 hi

Have you watched stranger things?
Daz ever time sad I always go on my phone and daz games
Shut up you fuck off bastard 😂  Best line ever
The mum really like: don’t shank me! Let’s it happy
Dam why would you flip your mum off😂😂😂
a kid threw a chair at his mom…
"Omg sombody getting drop kicked across the living room" daz ones said
rescue cats!!!!
I know I'm a year late but what ever, Daz ur the best YouTuber. When my mum was in a bad mood especially round Christmas time, the eldest four children (me and my three older brothers) would shout that she was the Grinch whenever she was mad at up
YES FINALLY YOU WILL MEET JEO FROST OR SUPPER NANNY IN THIS VIDEO
Daz is HILARIOUS💀💀😭😭
Bloody... Jesus
Why do I want the oldest (the good one) to full on body slam the youngest one. Like shut him up please
Actually daz the ultimate birth control is a granade you can just shove it right up their ha 😆😆
Is no one going to mention that daz said ,  they have got them all lined up like little nazi’s
0:00 help Gizmo is so cute😭
He’s right about there’s nothing scarier than an angry mum😂
😂 his videos are the funniest😂
handcuff him jesus get the police
the dad left coz he knew the kids were satins
This is why couples shouldn't have kids
If I did this my arm and ass would be smacked
When the kid was in the shopping cart he said “Touch my Willy”🤣
11:55 the moms a full time punching bag
Omg ❤❤❤
Awwwwwwwwwwww I love gismo he or she is so cute ☺️
I genuinely think that the boy is autistic so it might not help
Reece said “kiss my willie” at -4:13
Daz =parenting Also daz = some kid is about to be dropped kicked across the living room 🤣
"AHHHHHHH HE'S BITTING"
"And Joe frost is dressed as an iKia couch
she has to introduce a punishment. they arent scared when she yells because they know there is no consequence and that if she is scared, she will not punish them.
is it just me or does super nanny's face look like it's covered in shit. eg 9:35 / 15:42
daz look genuinely so happy at the beginning with Gizmo (an awesome name)
Daz:AWWW THAT RIGHT ON THE TIT   Me: Chokes on ice cream
If i was like that my mom would be in jail for child abuse
That turned into a call of duty free for all
You are hilarious 😂
gizmo literally looks like iggy from jojos bizzare adventure. gizmo is a jojos reference
Daz: Parenting Also Daz: Okay that's what you'll get,you'll also GET MY BOOT
This is so funny Daz games
ded you her hem sa cesmi wele
Is anyone gonna ask how in the hell the kid learned all those cuss words?
bro my mum has 7 children (dont worry were nothing like those kids)
Makes a lot of good sense anytime you have sex you always run the risk.
DAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
My ex fell pregnant and unfortunately she was the one who blocked me on all things because I said she needed help with everything. I'm still trying now to be a part of my daughters life but I have to go down the legal route just so I can have access to my daughter to see her. Whilst I understand that a lot of men run away and want no part if it there are also a lot of men who do fight and do everything they can to see their child/children. Sometimes the mother is the difficult one. Sometimes the mother decides to use the child as a weapon. Its not just men.
I would've smacked the shit out of those children. Idc about gentle parenting at that moment, if those shits smack me first I will hit them back just as hard. Gotta learn that people won't tolerate their bs🤷🏻‍♀️
you should watch the show with aussie teens and they go like across the country 😭❓
In my opinion   She mainly jsut observ3s and just does naughty chair corner and step   We all know those methods and you’re meant to be a supernanny and when we all know these come on you’re rubbish.
Supernanny doesn’t do much I think to improve things.
And Joe Frost is dressed like an IKEA couch💀
Smack em
I’m not scared of my mum
There actually was one impossible kid, Eric cartman
I have a friend who’s sixteen her son Eli turned 1 in October and when she was pregnant the father kept being indecisive about whether he wanted a part of Eli’s life or whatever. I actually stepped up and helped her through her pregnancy and even help her with Eli at times. I’m 20 I met her when we were in middle school we’ve been friends a long time and I’ve done more for this baby than his actual dad and I honestly haven’t done much. I just helped her and occasionally visit to help her with stress and help take care of him every now and again but for the most part it’s all her. She’s doing a phenomenal job and she loves him to death. I never really understood the change that happens over the course of a pregnancy and how deep a connection but I’ve never seen someone look at something as lovingly as she looks at that goofy child. It’s crazy to me. I help her where I can. Her parents force her to clean the house and do all the dishes and she’s become a maid on top of her being a mum on top of school and it makes me so mad that the father left them to deal with it alone. Im not fit to be a father. There are certain things I wouldn’t be good at but I am good at helping kids. And helping friends. I care about them both a lot and I’m not Eli’s dad I’m more like his uncle tbh. It’s crazy to me.
What makes me sad is a lot of kids on super nanny are undiagnosed with autism, I grew up the same way and layer learned I was autistic and these meltdowns were sensory overload, I learned to handle my way of thinking and grew. But un experienced parents, or rather parents unwilling to learn, never realise its not just a naughty kid, it's a kid who need help to learn, and understand how to manage things.
Worst law ever... not being allowed to physically punish children
I’m on my mom tablet
Daz I’m 13 years old and I am so happy to watch ur vids
Just imagine how bad it was when the cameras weren’t rolling in that video. Sometimes behind the cameras is worse than in front of the camera
Some times I’ve glad my mum and dad raised me how they did, wack round the head if I is behaved and I am perfect compared to my 2 cousins from the same mum who tried the naughty step.. and there fucking demons when it comes to the 2 of them together separately there manageable but together, get ur affairs in order. But for the multiple people putting in the number for child line in there phone chill they don5 beat or abuse me they give me a little bonk on the head so chill out
im not that old so i can remember like when i was 6 my dad using a "naughty space" and all it did was piss me off and make me bored, i literally never thought about what i did wrong or my impact on other people- I also lacked regret or remorse, im still developing that, so i didnt really yknow feel bad or stuff
Arent all four year olds like this my little brothers like this o_o
I help my cousin with her son and he is violent but he is mostly violent in defense of himself. His mom thinks he need help but when I have been talking to him I have showed him how to handle someone picking on him. So far he is doing better and if he keeps this good behavior up he gets to have a sleepover at my house and play on my xbox.
ok but hear me out… 0:20 was the best part of the video
“Ahhhhh he’s biting” had me laughing😂😂😂
My mom did the exact same thing if i tried to bite someone
You are a great man and you are so nice and kind and caring for the mum and it might be hard for mum because you know like maybe there’s no one there or maybe the dad is in there for them which is bad but I shall definitely respect you😊
Me watching this video looking at the kid someone needs to wash his mouth out with soap. My mom literally would’ve dropped kick me across the kitchen and then disowned me and put me in foster care
13:14
my aunty got a certificate for daydreaming. i even remember her showing me and its legit, with the fancy font and everything.
Hi
1:22 “and Joe frost is like an ikea couch” 😂😂😂 I’m dying god save me 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I have the same dog
As a year 3 student I once bit someone and drew blood in a full bite mark (all teeth broke skin even the back ones) and I used to bite people as an open option in fights but the last time was the time I drew blood and was also the hardest bite since I was in a headlock by a year 6 twice my size and couldn't breathe so I bit down and didn't let go (I got my chin under his arm to bite)
That nanny apparently forced a most likely autistic child with sensory issues to eat things that they could not eat, and as an autistic person with foods I can't eat that would be my worst nightmare.
My dad ran off for the milk never came back😂🎉🎉
Gizmo is so cute 🥰
supernanny: hola cat what u up to cat: roaming u tw** what a cat does u du*b*ss
daz: im going to put u down now dog: OMG NO PLEASE walky again
My granny Medusa would turn the kids to stone
Seeing kids like this...makes me want to snort a line of birth control. Also if I'd EVER spoken to my mom like that I'd have been dead before age 9
My parents had a time out chair,
instead of those videos, they should show episodes of this show when teaching birth control in school. :D
I used to sit on the naughty step, started to count the dots on the wall smth about that step made younger me stay 😭
Bare in mind Daz says he hate kids but has one..... POV ur child's most recent emojis  😡🖕👹 Your daughter shall cause mischief and kill you. The next video: Why I killed my father >:)
Bro is that a man or a woman 🤣
When I was wee if my siblings or I were bad we were sent to the "Naughty Step" for five mins,if we left early we got taken back and the time was doubled until we behaved
5:07
Your dog is cute
Son:curses at mom Me: right where’s the bottle of soap 🧼
“I watered you” 😭😭😭
noe,AUH-
Why would he have a sandwich for breakfast
One time when I was in time out I was so angry I picked up the chair and threw it against the door and it shattered and it marked the door😂
"aNd JoWfRoSt Is DrEsS LiKe A ikEa CoUcH"
I hate small children they get on my nerves especially when they scream lol
7:57
I have the mom look with my friends 💀
Hi
My mom did the naughty spot too but I had to put my forehead to the wall. Also did anyone else have a wooden spoon with faces drawn on them for hidings.
My dog has the same name as yours
what if she lied about being on the pill
4:42 look at Jo, just standing there in the corner, like a curtain 😂
12:10 out of context
6:34 I like your cut g
My dad was not there when I was younger but he recently just got in touch with my mom and it has been definitely a bit better he does have a wife and kids but it a lot better
I have a 42 ounce Gatorade bottle filled with tea
My god this is horrible to watch
Me and daz had the same bitting experience 😂
Daz that not normal kid or im just a super responsible kid i got beat a lot btw
When I was on the naughty step I would laugh and giggle - sorry mother …
you know it's a good video when youtube makes a joke in the comments
Bro that kid bro 😂 hahahaha bro
Ty for the tip for sex edu daz :)
And there’s Joe standing in the corner of the room like a curtain lmfao
Daz I’m big fan bro I’m 9 and I watched your videos since I was 4
As much as I agree with Daz’s speech about how guy’s shouldn’t run off when getting a woman pregnant, let’s not forget that the woman can run off too. It’s exactly what my “mom” did, once she had me, she left me with my dad and never helped out, leaving the province many times and refusing to pay child support despite the court order. So to anyone, if you get someone pregnant/get pregnant, either put the baby up for adoption if neither of you want it/aren’t ready for it, or accept that your lives are different now
how the hell are you single, literally id love to have someone as funny as you!
Daz: she’s a full time mum, and punching bag😂😂😂😂😂😂 he’s too funny
I got a certificate for best handwriting once🥲
my dogs name is gizzmo too
Rhys: NOTHING!!  Daz: Aright that’s what you’ll get, you’ll also get my *BOOT!!*
When u where talking about gettin a girl prego like my eggo my mom walked in 💀💀
I’m not mental had me dying
daz has been my favourite youtube for a few years now                           keep up the good work
I love this man dearly 💗💗💗💗
“That’s how I get her attention, I dislocate her JAW.”
Sometimes... you gotta beat them up to learn. Not beat them up until they can t feel anything anymore, ofc. But a belt or a shoe might help from time to time
Daz can you do more super nanny pls I loved this video
If I would have caused in general (like saying something I heard on tv) I would be in so much trouble. If I would have cussed at her I would be dead
I just have to point out that some people take birth control but not just for not having kids...
I was trying to drink my tea an I hear that was Wright in the
Giz is cute
NAZIS WTF
“Like little Nazis” 😺
Petition to call Gizmo's fans "Gizzlers"

I WAS GETING READY TO SMACK ASS
I have 2 bosten terriers like yours
I mean I like to say if they bite yeet the little shite
Props to the mom for trying to make sure her kid eats, even though he doesn't want to
When I was little we used to go to my parents friends houses, there was one girl and she hit my mom out of anger (she was like 4), my mom hit her right back. Last time she ever hit anyone. She has also put chilli peper on my mouth when I cussed or talked in slang, she would close me in a dark room if I was naughty.
As 26 years old , growing up when my mom used to give me that death stare  I did whatever she wanted  wrong  right don't care 🤣🤣🤣   thank you but I wanna live
I can’t watch das at midnight! I laugh to hard 😂
These kids with an African nanny/ a mother from another country would get their shit rocked.👀👀👀
Daz was probably in the back ground😂
i haven't got tea i have a glass of ice i'm in sitting here in my coat because i'm cold eating my ice
All I can drink is tea and water
“Full time mum & punchbag” 😂😂😂😂
“And she looks like an ikea couch.” 🤣 “They might be twins, but one may be really bad at math.” 😂
AAA HES BITEING 😂😂😂😂😂
AHHHH HES BITIN
I would walk out if he was my kid
9:59
It’s the thumbnail 😂
I swear every time I'm on the floor by the end of it 🤣
I love this I was watching this at late a night so I was so hard not laugh 😂
Daz I completely agree with your statement about being responsible for your actions, I did when I was 16 and I had my amazing 3 year old boy. And I’ve been there from the beginning
Thanks daz- watching this at midnight and I was laughing my head off since the first 3 seconds -thanks for getting me told off
GIZMOO
if i ever did that to my mom i would even lose any systems i would just lose my life XD
yo that Iggy from jojo
UR DOG IS SO CUTE
Why is it every time she shouts at Reece I think of Reece’s puffs Reece’s puffs 😂
*Daz:* I know you're off at my following cout I see it in your eyes  *Gizmo:* 👁👄👁
It’s the most horrible thing for dads to just leave it’s disgusting like my dad left me and mum mum when I was 5-6
IF SO YESSSSSS LETS GOOOO!
IS THAT A FRENCHIE
daz you should just make a 'dazwatches' channel. also love you content!
there would be no better use for the spray naptime in a time like this 🫡
10.01 time stamp
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💜🖤💜🖤
9:56 lol
What I did when I was younger I don’t know why but my mum put me on the stairs right as a naughty spot I saw you ripping out my hair
My friend got a certificate for not coming in school and guess what I can’t even get one for being in school
WEAN I'M DOWN HE MAKES ME LAUGH
You know how dogs can look exactly like their owners 😂
Is it just me but when they were talking in the kitchen, the little girl went for super nannys bag 👜😶..
Daz: there’s nothing more scary than a silent angry mom. Me: my mom full on yells at me when I’m in trouble. There nothing more scary than an angry yelling mom.
Im not saying this as a joke or to get love at all this is completely true and im 13 now  My dad left me when i was 1 and my mum couldn't look after me so i was adopted when i was 1 and a half and when i was five my dad missed one contact and I've never seen him since and asked my mum if i could bring my gf to a contact and that was May 14th 2022 and she hasn't got hold of me or my dad since
Me: Jesus that door looks like it’s been through a lot
They do the intros like a damn Godzilla trailer
I think daz should watch the Chapman family
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤
Pls gimme your dog😊
Daz: “this is why I can’t do kids”  Daz’s kid: *am I a joke to you?*
This video reminds me of me and my family memers
That’s literally my family, 2 older sisters that are 1 year apart, and then me the only guy that’s 4 years younger than the oldest
I love daz so much he is so funny 😂
I love daz so much he is so funny 😂
I love how I'm watching this the night before I remove my IUD. (Switching BC definitely not getting another IUD but definitely not having any children in my life yet.)
Dude when I was younger like 7 my mom was watching her friends kid while they were finalizing there divorce that little shit bite me hard on my arm and I slapped the shit out of him he was like 5 😭
As a child me and my brother we weren’t the nicest kids 😅 My mother worked 17 hour shifts and we were just horrible we broke out of our rooms and put paint all over the walls and other things to the point she had to put a lock on our door so she could actually sleep…..I uh broke the lock and Um out a whole bunch of like frozen meat on the floor and peanut butter and stuff that was just sticky I FEEL SO BAD BECAUSE I NEVER KNEW HOW HARD SHE WORKED JUST TO AFFORD THAT SMALL APARTMENT WE HAD
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"I've fed you, I've watered you." 😆
When the kids I work with misbehave, I pull out the stern voice and that is when they know they've gone too far. It's amazing
my kid get that bad, he gettin a good ole smackin from papa till he learns to act right.
Gizmos ADORABLE ❤❤❤❤❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
I remember when I went on the norty spot and I was for peeling by my self and the I pissed me self on the step and she just looked at me and it was so scary
i love the puppy
And this is why I could never be a parent I am never going to be, I am too petty, I would just treat them exactly the same way they treat me. Bear the consequences of your actions 👀
What ever happened to standing in the corner on your tipi toes for 30min
We want gizmo in another budeo
"Pull my hair back and put me in blue! Now!" -Daz Black
Can I have Gizmo 😊
If you could please tell my Dad that
I have a Sri Lankan Mum who was raised in England and my mum does NOT PLAY

LMFAOOOO MY MOM HAD TO BITE ME TOO
Where’s Take-A-Break in all of this 😂
Yeah I definitely shouldn't be a mom,I'd smack all of them
Hey Daz!!!! I'm a huge fan of ur content!!!!! I have a massive crush on Sadie sink, she plays max in stranger things, I've been through a lot of really rough life shit, abuse, mental manipulation, and a few other messed up things and I'm only 17. Point Is, Sadies gorgeous smile and amazing personality has gotten me through a lot lately..... And I plan on writing a love song for her next year and singing it on Americas got talent for her!!!! I love her more than most of my family at this point,  it has been my dream for a while now to win her heart over and be with her someday, I would NEVER leave her!!!!! Not for all the money in the world, I can't stand poeple that leave after kids, my dad did the same when I was four and my sister was less than a year old...... Sadie is the only reason that I'm still here fighting, and I will do everything in my power respectfully to repay her ....  I hope u see this comment and thnx for the laughs man take it easy luv ya tons!!!!!! 9 mil subs here we come!!!!!! -Stockton
Ur dog is so cute!!!
I feel bad for the door and the light
39
In the shop Rhys said kiss my Willy and that made me smile for decades lol
No offense but how much pot did that dog smoke before the video started
Daz it’s my 19th birthday today!! Can I please get a happy birthday!!
as much as i appreciate Daz sticking up for the mum sadly we dont know what happened between the mum/dad, a 4 year old doesnt just pick up that kind of language on hes own so i suspect when the camera's arent on the mum isnt as innocent as she looks with them rolling, it could be the dad is a decent hard working guy and the mum is at fault and broke up with him/not allowing him to have anything to do with the kids...some women do also just want to get pregnant and not keep the guy around so yea, but it is easier to just point at the man and say its him lol
my mom woulda hit me so hard for acting like this lol
They got em all lined up, like little nazis
In the beginning Of the video when you showed his dog that dog is adorable
7:47 -7:55😂😂😂

Cute dog daz
i can confirm a slient mom is the death mom
I'm probably late but, I know I sound childish but, could you react to, race to the edge on Crack (it's from how to train your dragon I don't think you'll like but just suggesting
God daz your awesome
I feel like I’m doing something wrong because Supernanny has not dissuaded me from wanting kids at all. It’s actually the opposite. Like when watching It’s Me or the Dog or My Cat from Hell. It just shows that you have to actually put in the effort to be a good parent if you want the rewards of having children.  Great content as always, Daz Man.
Gizmo is a awesome dog WTH that kid needs a spanking where's the firm father figure 🤔.  WTH that mother is no were near stern heck she's extremely lenient smh.  Naughty spot is a very stupid idea because what discourages the kid from repeating the exact same thing or keeps the kid in the naughty spot smh 🤦.  "Be a man" is NOT a toxic saying that thinking is bullocks though yeah "take responsibility" is what "be a man" means.
Just me who heard the kid after the mum called him embarrassing say “kiss my willy”
My ex had his daughter terrified of him all he'd have to do Is give her this look and say her name "Lucille."  and she'd run for the hills. Her mum died when she was born so he mastered the mom look 😅🤣💯 but Jesus I was terrified when he got that look
Omg my name is kaicey 😰
I’m so stoned rn and when he called Jo a curtain I choked
I use to curse and fight my brother
Thats why you should wear condoms😂😂
This is an old vid but when I was little I bit my mom. She bit me right back. Let me tell u I never EVER EVER tried doing that again 😂😂😂
Love your speech at the end there very educational
11:30 whatt did he sayyyy
😂4:15 & 4:35😂
𝓦𝓱𝓪𝓽 𝓴𝓲𝓷𝓭 𝓸𝓯 𝓭𝓸𝓰 🐶
Him saying that he flip his mom off and mock her and he just says about the look bro my mother d..d since i was born idk
Wait did he and sohaila breackup
The worst thing I ever did as a child was I threw my younger sister's (we shared a room at the time) little Disney bench at the door during a time-out when I was 7. I got hit so hard I couldn't breathe. I still flinch whenever someone raises their hand at me. I'm Autistic and aggression is one of the more "classic" Autism traits. Honestly, that mom was giving way too much to that kid. One good bonk on the head'll do him good, not hard, just enough to scare him.
Dad left to get milk
Dogy
I would slap em children like will smith
Man an ass whipping would solve a lot of those issues
I have a Boston to
She's not really a super nanny bc she didn't do anything to help the mum
Y y y you’ve watered him?
"Like little naztis" 😂😂😂
shinies shoes? daz were they dazzeling?👞👞
I have these neighbours, and the mither of this family is actually rly nice, but her son is mental, he does have like leaening disabilities and stuff, but like, once, i was at my bsfs because my mum was over for coffee as well and some of the over neighbours, including tgis family, so of course this lady and her son came, and btw this boy is like 2-3 years yonger than me, and me and my bsf where minding are own business, when this boy came over to us and started tell us how he was guna make a story up, so i hsd to go home?? And so he said he had a plan kr some shit, and we kept telling him we didn't care, we went kinda just ignored him, and did the opposite of what he wanted us to do. So after an hour he went over to my bsfs mum and told her id punched him? I did not, so we told her that, of course she believed us, and he got really mad. So when we went back tk where we where before, he started punching and kicking and throwing stuff at us, his mum didn't notice until half an hour after- he still hates me to to this day for no reason-
Who else grabbed tea ?
It's not beating the piss out of her no it's beating the shit out of her
Daz: that's some sort of weapon and the boy: no it's a orange
Boy: punching Daz: right in the tit! Meeting the shit mum:and don't kick me!!
14:37 what is that to Daz's left?
Oh my god this explains why I grew up never wanting kids....
I’m kinda scared if daz decides to babysit kids...
The kid yelling for no reason but a 4 years old to 17 years old!
morel of the story never have kids
Pain works to control kid worked for me and my siblings
“PULL MY HAIR BACK AND PUT ME IN BLUE” 😂
Bruh I got a certificate for being the “roblox queen” since I was failing everything and it was on my prom night and literally everyone looked at me funny All because I said I liked the play roblox once
What he said about boys having the responsibility if they have sex is so true
When I was in year 1 my friend got a certificate for pissing himself no lie😂
Is it weird is till want kids 😅
Giz is so cute
If I EVER even had a THOUGHT to speak to my mother like that I would’ve been skinned alive- (not genuinely my parents are just no bs type I love them I swear-)
👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊👊
If they were my children I'd send them to boarding school and idk if they would punish them  Just get them away😘
❤❤❤
Only daz can make a 2 min video into 15 mins lol
i want to steal his dog.🫢
5:28 look at his lips
They are living in the horrid Henry house
When I was a kid,  there were two ways I could die... natural causes or talking back to my parents
he said RIGHT IN THE TIT
AHHH he's biting !!!!!!!!!!

3:45 this is exactly me
yes there is nothing stopping you from moving from the naughty step or spot but you know if you move away your screwed
Bruh
Whe the boy said  KISS MY WILLY I DIED🤣🤣😂😂😂
I was getting a row from my mum when I was younger and she told me to go to my room, so I did but as I was walking away I muttered under my breath that she was a bitch. Little did I know she was behind me 😂 she put me in my room and held the door closed, I started throwing a tantrum, messed all my room up, threw stuff at the door and eventually I gave up and kicked the corner of the door… I broke it 😂, the full door came off the hinges and she was trying to not to laugh but she looked shocked at the same time. I thought I was gonna die that day
not daz teaching us where babys come from

I’m late but are we going to talk about the dog looking like he just got done with a damn night shift
If I ever have kids they will never act like this  u ain't gonna hit me and get away with it they will learn today
Good old fashion ass whipping will solve this problem!
Nanny has to much make up
Dad is probably holding camera
🤣"the naughty spot" bruh My mum used to put me there when I did something stupid and got in trouble and I tried to get up and walk away once and her ex grabbed me and dangled me upside down off of a porch that was 1 story off the ground🤣 looking back that's kinda messed up but now if someone gets into an argument in this house she just grabs a frying pan and throws it near the 2 people in an argument
Daz your so funy
Imagine a heavy metal song playing when the little boy is just beatin the crap out his mom 😅🤣
Awwww French Bulldog
AAAGAH HES BITING 🤣🤣😅🤣🤣🤣😂😅😂🤣🤣🤣  *funtime Freddy*
There a lined up like lite Nazis  Me: Excellent, kids to kill! *Springtrap*
It's funny looking at this because until I was 10, I never screamed or shouted at anyone, and I always helped around the house willingly. I didn't really complain about food or anything even when I had allergies. I was just well behaved i guess
How can the kids act like that in front of a stranger, I'm just embarrassed for them
The naughty spot worked for me. The trick is to keep bringing him back every time they get up. Eventually, the child breaks and stays still. My son hatesssss the naughty spot now because he knows he cant break me.
It's not just the dads that walk out, my partner has a daughter and the mother walked out on both of them when she was 5 months old, I've been raising her since she was 6 months old and now she is 5. I couldn't be prouder of the young girl she has become x
I could never have kids because if their like this i'd slap the shit out of them
Hey I had a cat called gizmo very cute but he dead
My mom would nag and shout.... But when she becomes silent, speaks in a calm manner and just give me the look, that's even more scary cuz i know she's very mad.
9:18 they’re evaluating how long you have to live -
3:47
My names Sara and my dad used to grab me by my ankles and turn me upside down whenever I screamed or hit. (I've always said all little girls are evil) and eventually they did the same thing and the doc said well she models her behavior off you guys if you yell to wake her up she'll yell back and also if I was nice to my brother for a week I was allowed to get a book from chapters and I kid you not 6 months later I was fully adjusted
Nah Daz should make a video of Playing with gizmo. Gizmo is adorable
Why not just give here little boy up for adoption then going like chill more then like anger more just give the kid up for adoption
The OMG HES GONNA get drop kicked across the livening room
i relate to kayce, i gave up on getting attention from my mom ever since she got my brother, i really hope she gets time for me when he grows up im just really sad i won’t be able to have her for a good chunk of my childhood, if u see this mom i love you, it’s not ur fault
what kind of tea do you drink
this is why you should be allowed to hit kids 👏
9:54 I DIED 💀💀
e

Awww
Meeeeeeee I'm is in possible
Daz,does Sarah have a mom,it's ok if she don't like I'm just asking if she does not being disrespectful
Yeah mom I’m running up your energy bill I’m look at it right now! God daz I love you 😂
The mum: No! Reece: FU- 7:19
When daz was talking about the mom look I remembered that when I was younger my mom would grab me by the arm, get close to my ear and wisper stop in that like mom voice and I stopped
naw cus if i pulled what the little boy did and hit and cuss at my mom i would be in a grave 🧍‍♀️
When he bit her all I thought of in my head was "we got a biter 🚨🚨"5:05 in a very hard southern accent
lmao and if yall did that shit in an indian/pakistani family, yall getting a flying slipper or a smack on your face. The worst thing that can happen is you get beaten the shit out of.🤣😂
All I'm saying is a little bit of physical discipline goes along way
Dad should react to jordybuzz 😂👍
5:20 that's "abuse" now, Daz
Sorry black mother beat you like a man and you never want make her again because you see Jesus
BRUH DID THAT 4 YEAR OLD JUST SAY "KISS MY WILLY"?!??! WHAT THE FUCK
Is the nanny just there watching
Love how he literally screamed like Mike Wasoski when he said “AHHHHHH HES BITING”
7:27 he went to get milk
Im currently 6 months pregnant and my sons dad ran off and left me… this shit hit far to close to home
Can confirm my mums done that look thought I was gonna die
that spit-
And then the law says your not allowed to hit your kids
"I hope you have your T" no Daz I'm on my T shots for a reasonnnnnn 😭😭😭😭😭😭 (I'm kidding, I'm trans and take testosterone)
“BL00D-Y JE-SUS!” 😂
Dude my asian mom will smack the hell out of me if i said a word that doesn't make her happy
Omg I used to mock my mum too and she told me I had to stay in my room and I can’t go it cake cause it was someone’s bday, anyway is it just me but when ur in public and u do something bad my mum just gives me the glare and when I we reach  home I’m dead!
My mom did the same! I bit some at preschool, after she heard she bit me, not enough to hurt but enough for me to never do it again
hoooooooly shit what the fuck is wrong with that dog
Okay your right I did that once and my mom did the same thing I swear to fucking god😂😂😂 she didn’t even hit me after that
Only if she tricks you and lies them gets pregnant and refuses an abortion you have every right to leave because you will otherwise throw your life or childhood  away for kids if she lies it's not your fault
I know I’d be terrified of the mother when she’s angry. But I also feel incredibly sorry for her. She seemed like a really sweet person really but being a single mum to 3 kids, two of which having terrible behaviour problems definitly doesn’t sound easy.
I love your dog he’s so cute🥰
Nothing that's what youl get and you get my boots
🤦🏽‍♀️ I am new to watching Daz And I've figured out I can't drink anything while I watch him or the drink comes out of my nose cause I'm laughing to hard
My dog is named gizmo I call him giz
I was a very bad child when I was young because I got mad really easily and when I got mad I got MAD. I would scream, shout, throw things, hit people, all that's jazz,  and it was nuts, I feel bad for my parents for having to put up with that for like 10 years before I stopped
This mother deserves the world
Daz should be Supernanny. he is now superdaddy
When I was like 1 year old I bit my mom and out of reflex she hit my really hard and I never buy any one again
9.55 lol
I swear when that kid is older he is  gonna get slapped so hard his soul is gonna fly outta his body for like 10 seconds
I thought the mum just smacked her child not the other way around
If I was that 4 year old I would have been smacked so much
9:56 i genuinly was thinking the same thing, that was weird lol
I would’ve slapped the shit out of that kid the first time he swears at me, he wouldn’t dare repeat it, as I learned when I was a child, respect is the most important
They need to get smacked
9:19 IM DYING WHY IS THIS SO ACURATE IM A MINOR SO I STILL LIVE W/ MY PARENTS AND I STILL GET TOLD OFF THIS IS SO FUCKING FUNNY WTF IM DYING
“She’s got them all lined up. Like the Nazis.” Amazing. 🤩
“We don’t want kids.  COME HERE SUPERNANNY.”
amo mucho a daz
The littlest one is like my 4 month old puppy
I sometimes wach super nanny but why does the nanny look like the town mayor
You know why the 4 year old swears because the mom does it 👏I👏N👏F👏R👏O👏N👏T👏 of him
The Dog is the best part in the whole video
i am a big fan
Omg yes at school we used to have to line up outside after every class that we had and the teacher would rate your shoes to see who’s the shiniest and u would get a certificate 😭😭😭😭
My mum would throw that little boy in the road if he did that 🤣
Its never to late for adoption
there goes your monetization
0:34 “you’re not that guy pal, trust me you’re not that guy.”
You dog is so cute
The Mum look is the most scariest shit I have ever seen 😓
Iggy?
My mum would lock me in my room and turn of the light
Call in the Asian mums!
That belt lookin mighty fine
My dog never behaves that way ;-) Good on you Daz, love your content.
That’s time for the belt
I mean I got a certificate for learning how to close a door @ my tech school😐😐 school really is nuts.
W mom
What breed is he
11:29 surprised daz didn't talk about that
Even my cat is less dangerous 😂
why is the "ur on the wire gizz" so cute and funny
Gizmo needs a channel or hell take dazs
https://youtu.be/tiBqjOyfx-g?list=TLPQMjkwODIwMjKiZlY4Wg5qlg
Omg my dogs name is gizmo
0:41 *WHAT?*
My mom used to pour uncooked rice on the floor and make me and my sister stay on our knees with arms up for like a hour😭😭
☺
That kid is a future Chris brown
Love how Daz recognized how stressed Tara was as a single mom and didn’t judge her. Good on you Daz!
daz:' i'm planning on uploading more sketches' *goes silent on daz black channel for 11 months*
“Idiot!!!” Me:🔪
You know what it might be she doesn't seem that she disciplines them she kind of just tells him to stop and expect them to I think that's what it is I think they're acting out because they know that she won't do anything it's just my opinion
Did I hear that right and did he say kiss my w**** in the cart
Daz is too funny
are very right about the mum my mum always does that I always mocha and she always turns around and does the bad look
I always say that f weird sometimes
2:02 tho
I I bet my brother my dad said he would Cut my toe off
you’re hilarious and I love your videos you never stop making me laugh
Growing up my mum used the naughty step which was the very bottom step on the stairs. But she had this like Kat that I had sit on where on the side was traffic lights. And the red light would be on when I first got put on the step and then the Amber one would come on when it was close to the end and then the green one when I could leave. But I was terrified of sitting on the step because I was convinced witches were after me and they would chase me down the stairs and if I wasn’t on the stairs they wouldn’t get me, so I was sure they would get me when I was out on the naughty step so I avoided it at all costs.  In short make your kids thing witches are after them and can get you on the naughty step. It’ll work then
Also, instead of shouting, emotional coaching is much more effective. You need to get on your kids level and ask them how they would fee being treated that way. Ask them why they think treating you that way is acceptable. Kids don't handle emotions well at all so we have to teach them how to.  I once made my nephew sit on time out for 45 mins because he refused to apologise. He had already used the need to wee excuse once so I refused again. He purposely squeezed a pee out on the stairs. He sat in it for 5 minutes until he realised he was uncomfortable and said sorry. The he helped me clean it. Then it was a clean sheet until he was naughty again 😂
Those kids have no clear boundaries and no consequences that are followed through with. Neither of my 2 kids acted like this. My eldest is autistic and by god does he know if he attacks someone or was naughty like this he's in deep shit. Even though special need can be a reason for bad behaviour, it is no excuse. Positive parenting does work if it's implemented right. I have never had to put my 8 year old on time out, ever. Smacking only makes your kids behave out of fear of being hit. I prefer for my kids to respect me and the boundaries.
That kid hasn’t got phyco logical problems, HE HAS RABIES
Gizmo is beautiful and I love the way Daz loves him
i don't care what i act like in the future, if i have a child and they are assulting me, a childs jaw is being dislocated
are u that one lonely single man with a dog?
My bro loves to scream tho.
Ow my ear drums when he says welcome back!- I loved this video but remmber that vid you made on ruby rube saying stop yelling? Bro tour doing it in a mic and it's much worse and much louder great vid tho-
I remember one time in Y6 I got an award for an “improved smile” 💀😭
If my mum does not speak to me it is worse then screaming at me
We need to get gizz on broadway now that glare in his eyes was magical ✨
Bro my little brother is 7 and he hurts me all the time lol. he swears worse than that to lol.
As soon as I saw the dog I knew this was gonna be a good video
14:00 fetus deletus?
"SHUT UP AND.. F##K OFF" My mum would have killed me if I said that💀
13:44 🫶🏻
Me watching this without tea 💀
Daz is the opposite of Andrew Tate lol
Put him down👨🏽‍💼😟😟😬😬
Naughty spot: stick them in dog cages for 20 minutes
Love dad so much
Best youtuber no lie innit
Whate till he is ten then fly him out to America and put him on scared straight
Rhys against Andrew Tate right now
gizmo is ADORABLEEEEEEEE
dog :)
'HE HIT THE TIT"  "GOD HE CAN THROW"
When we had the naughty step we had gates XD so my mother would lock the gates so you stayed on the naughty step.
Daz: let’s get into the video! Ads: not today
Warning: Low Disk Space, click here to free up space.
the dad went to get milk
The way my reflexes would have full sended that child 😂
@daz those kids are very lucky that they are not from the Caribbean or live in the Caribbean
me:he will never stop!                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Daz: use the mom look.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         me: yea that will definitely stop him
To be honest I’d lock the kids out of the house in the cold rain and see if they want to behave badly or stay inside bro I could not deal with bad kids
get an abortion 15:00
I feel for Kacy in the way that both of my older sisters are problematic and always demand our mum’s attention. I’m the youngest of three (also the only remaining child (they’re 18 and 20)) and the last time me and my mum did something alone was three years ago when we went to the movies. At this point I’ve given up on trying to spend time with her and enjoy my childhood because the way I see it, if neither of my adult sisters will act their age, it’s the least I can do to take some stress off of my mother.
You always give me a laugh😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Me and my brother were apparently golden 🤣🤣
15:42 there always is the option of being gay
Good Advice For 18 +
Lol
My mum would record me :/
This is definitely one of the reasons why I don't want to have kids... one, I don't even know how to parent kids and two, I don't even know how to be a parent.
I swear right when I was younger right I was being a right fokin goblin and my mum she like grabbed me by the arm and litterally threw me outside middle of the night and she never had any problems with me
“SHUT UP YOU FAT FUCKER” best thing I’ve ever seen a kid yell
If that mom got them presents for christmas that is ridiculous
Does no one care what type of Dog  he has ? Answers on a comment section PLEASE !
Supper nanny did nothing but talk-
I'm sorry but....Gizmo's eyes are social distancing
I bit once, then my mom bit me back, made me stop fast lol
I'm a divorced and  I have 3 kids and its a nightmare for me  My youngest one just does what ever he feels like when ever he feels like, but when I get angry they shut up and do what I tell them to do, because they know now they have F*** up lol
MY CATS NAMED GIZMO AFTER GIZMO OUT OF THE GREMLINS LOL
hoenstly ill never forgive the show for how they deal with neurodivergent children
that kid would kill Andrew tate
My cats name is gizmo
this is my favourite one loved this but id lov to watch you play granny that would make me laugh so much 🤣
once i got a certificate for eating a sausage roll the slowest i was 5 look at me now
My mum has 7 kids she barely has anytime to herself
7:46 the meme
when i was little i always used to watch this 🤣🤣
Thank fucking god im gay
IM RUNNING UP YOUR ENERGY BILL MUM that had me laughing 😂😂😂
Tbh, I would've punched all of those kids lol
Putting that 4 year old up for adoption ngl
your dog is so cute !
“Some kid is gonna get drop kicked across the living room”
Awwwww Gismo is TO CUTE
Where is the woden spoen
Who remembers the naughty step 😂
My dogs name is gizmo
Man daz at the end of the video gave us parent advice I'm going to listen to that
The fact that people think being the eldest sibling the best and I’ve been told many times it’s the easiest thing possible is that no one really understands the terminology and outcomes of being the oldest and having younger siblings stops you from having much time with you mum or dad or just your parents in general. It’s sucks tbf. It’s not easy, it’s not simple. It sucks having to sit their knowing your parent(s) are under pure stress and u can’t do anything to help or u can’t help out and still get affection. It just leaves me upset and angry..
I genuinely find shows like Supernanny has not aged well at all given Jo Frost hasn’t got any psychology, first aid training, insurance and parenting degrees. Plus the approach of eat disorders and Autism is uncomfortable to watch. Including the lack of consent for reairings without the childrens permission. It breeds shock value and shaming. It’s a liability.
never trust Jo Frost around autistic children if you watch some of the episodes for she deals with  it's absolutely shocking
Anyone else hear the four year old say kiss my Willy in the shop? 😂😂😂
I got a cup of tea especially for the video😌
IMAGINE WHAT THE NEIGHBOURS WOULD SAY:O
I've nvr seen YouTube comment on a video cool
Just found your channel im pissing myself laughing
I definitely should never have kids cause if they were like that id kick their asses
Uuuuaaaaaahhhh put him in a m and a ring
dc
the best part of the video 8:54
It not only affects the mum but the kid (or kids) because then they can't have that parental figure to help them when needed while they're growing up.
I don’t have tea I have cheesecake
Well daz. You're too handsome to be single ❤ love little gizzy
You are the best
Ur to funny lol 😂
I would just put them up for adoption
What I would do in this situation is I would be nice to the good one so the other kids are like oh that’s how mummy will like me
My mums friends though my stepdad was abusing her because of her black eyes but it was me as a child I would head but her and even broke her nose
" Welcome back to Daz watches, BIRTH CONTROL!!!!!" To fookin good, also daz comparing mad 4 year olds to prisoners😂
these aren't kids. those are demons.
Y my y his
9:15 This exact same thing happened to me and she made the SAME FACE. Said nothing, didn't get punished, just gave me a look. I was pissing myself. Locked myself in the room for the rest of the night.
All jokes aside if my kid throw a punch at me they’d have a red mark on the side of their face! 💅
daz:: yes I am that lonely man with a dog  Sarah:: what am I a roach
If I treated my mum like the first 3 kids did I'd get hit across the back of the legs with a bamboo stick
WHO THOES KIDS ARE THE WERST
wow i haven't watched you in three years you've lost a lot of weight well done!
If I did literally anything those kids were doing mark my words I wouldn't live another day
Anyone notice how at the start the dog looks like its looking to the left and right at the same time as if it got slammed into the wall head first and survived
I half want the mum to grab a spray bottle and squirt them with water like a cat.
WE LOVE YOU GIZMO
I have 3 Boston’s  Same dog as you 🙂
My baby sister (not actually a baby anymore) used to try to attack me but I've day I got tired and grabbed her hands and legs as she tried to hit me and just held them still until she started getting tired and stared her straight in the eye and said "you're not going to win". She gave up and hasn't tried attacking me again since unless we are playing ninjas.
11:29 "kiss my willy"
Daz and Gizmo look alike. All dog owners look like their dogs.
gizmo is amazing best dog ever :)
Kiss my Willy 🤣🤣🤣🤣 bruh who taught that child to curse
4:12 best part of the whole video🤣
need to watch full episodes!!!
Good luck to them kids, you’ll get the worst beaten by Irish Parents
i would’ve picked them up and thrown em at the wall my temper would never
my cat’s name is gizmo
What if the kid at 3:05 by the purse, just takes some money out of the purse?
Heard my mum shout properly for the first time in years the other week. Oh my god I was terrified and I wasn't even the one being shouted at
The mum sounds like the average council house drug addict
He's a 6 but he is funny. He is a 12!! HOW ARE YOU SINGLE 🥰🥰
7:50 is the time where he says “omg some kids gonna get drop kicked across the living room
American Mrs doubtfire
GIZMO SO CUTE HE THE BEST BEST DOG CUTE EPIC
Blueeeeeeeeee I
I’m dieing💀☠️
like little natzis☺️☺️
Yes I have tea, but it’s cold because I’m a common criminal
Bro ur the funniest YouTube channel ever 🤣🤣
THAT'S MY MOM!!!! SHE DOES THAT!!!!!!
7:50 I nearly died of laughter that accent was great like he's a high pitched man in a bar
i had a naughty step on the stairs when i was younger and i would simply run up the stairs and into my bedroom 😭😭😭
3:08 my mum actually used to do this with me and my brothers artwork! its cuz she hated the kitchen tiles on the wall. we have a new kitchen now and we have a scrapbook instead
Daz is right. Mums that don’t yell at you are fucking scary. My mum always gave me a stern look and it would scare the hell out of me. (I mean of course your mum yelling at you is scary, this is just how i was raised😅)
jeez controler drift at the start bro
Daz is amazing for giving young men that pep talk on pregnancy and parenting. It is really important and isn’t talked about enough and young men need to be educated on things like this.
that mom  needs to slap the shit out of her kids
I got a quick fix for this its called a  belt trust it is very effective
Best contraception? Not doing the devils tango
"That's when you know your gonna DIE!" made me laugh.
Years ago I bumped into you and Leslie Wai in Soho London. Was the most awkward and funniest experiences ever! Still have the picture! ^^
I love how daz makes 4 minute video into a 15 minute one
Not the ikea couch 💀
Im wondering how these kids got this bad...
9:17 MY STOMACH DROPPED LMAO THAT WAS PERFECT
Bro if some random lady in all blue walked into my house and looked like a nun that would be a world champion of belt hitting I would be so scared and ask forgiveness of whatever god there is
The stern mum its when that like blood runs cold moment
I genuinely hate men who leave a woman alone with their child. One of my best friends got left by her husband with 2 little boys,one of them was born with developmental disabilities as well as physical, they are now 5 and 3 I believe but their dad has no interest in them. He found some new gf and had a baby with her. He refuses to pay any kind of money to help her with the kids and she can't work as well. I feel so bad for her cause she has not had one moment to herself since they were born. Even when they were together he would go drinking with friends after work instead of giving her a hand. I was also raised by a single mom and definitely have unresolved issues due to being alone all of my childhood while she worked. Men please be responsible and help. Even if you are not in a relationship with the mom,a child is made by 2 people and by disappearing from their life, you just show them you dont give a shit about them.
I have a dog named gizmo to🤞
"Wholesome content"  "My God he's adorable but I bet he's the worst one"  "BLOODY JESUS"  "Is that a screwdriver?? Definitely some kind of stabbing weapon"  "Oh my god these kids are SATAN"  "That's how I get mum's attention, I relocate her jaw"  "She was bitten by another mum"
Daz was about to have a meet and greet w Jesus when he was little
9:15  This mum look is scarier than any horror movie. This look actually gave me chills I'm not lying
But im just say like 80% of the kids on this show have like mental disorders and they get the "super nanny" instead of a FUCKING PHYSIOLOGIST
Nah my mom will slap me and swear at me and tell my whole family same with my dads family
It seems every time I want to watch you, they put you on my recommended.
After my mums husband died she was already raising 5 kids, oldest about 13, youngest was about 8 months. After she met my dad she had me and then when I was 3 we got a restraining order against him then she was basically raising 6 kids on her own. Especially since our oldest brother became a criminal lol 💀
I would beat the shish out of them
Instead of the step I was locked between our 2 front doors
I’ve been dying throughout this whole video and I peed my pants a bit
OK but 😊🤜👶
there is one word that can solve this. adoption
12:52 i was just thinking what abt throwing the child in the river or is that to far
Bruh i was like that when i was little mum gave me a slap and I stopped tho, they think it’s a joke as they laugh when they hit her. You gotta make them understand that they need to be serious and not find it funny yo hit the parent. If the kids hits you, you should be able to hit him too
One day those kids are gonna scroll through YouTube and find a video of themselves acting like this and then think "what was wrong with us"
That boy needs spanking till the belt or the mother hands leaves a print
I just noticed your dog is ADORABLE, THAT FACE 😊
Daz needs to be a safe sex assembly speaker at schools
Daz had the same reaction to the Super Nanny naughty spot as Cartman did in the Tsst episode of South Park.
You're dead if you get the mum look or hear your full name
if i did that to my mom i would be dead
Daz: talks about not wanting to stay on the time out step as a kid   Me: remembering how I put myself on the time out step when I thought I did something wrong 😅
If I was there I would just flog the shit out of them
This is why I should never have kids, but I’d have slapped that kid back. If it was THAT bad!
The twins..........
Also my triplet son acts like this I did nothing wrong it's straight up genes his sister is an angel
I need this question answered!
Wait do you not have an actual daughter?!
I had to sit on a carpet so me and my brother would scoot around on the hard wood floor on the carpet, like im still on it what u ganna do
It’s my first time watching this man and this is making me laugh so hard omg help it’s 11:30 pm
I can't help but think "where did Rhys hear that?" Because like yeah swearing happens but this 4yo said to his mom "Kiss my Willy" IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GROCERY STORE
The way the boy says suckling my willy 😂😂😂😂😂
See there is a beautiful thing my mother has graciously bestowed upon my rebellious kid age that corrected me called " La Choncla"
Daz: Joes really good she seems like a nice lady  Also daz: she looks like an ikea couch!
Nah I’m throwing my child across the room if he’s swearing at me
Super DAZ 💀😭
Wait daz waters his dog like a plant
Daz has shiny shoes
If I was the oldest kid I would just hold the younger kid until he dies of hunger :)
I bit my sister went and now she still has a scar on her arm with my teeth marks and especially my canine teeth because I had a huge canine teeth when I was 5
14:13 I’m infertile
One time my mum said there will be a punishment coming you won’t know  when but it will happen I’m still waiting for it in fear
11:00 My parents used this trick on me and my brother but whenever my brothers time was over he'd cry because he wanted to stay longer and if I see him I said that I wanted to do it too and when they refused I started to cry😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
Poor DAZ having a midlife crisis. 😂
Irish twins Daz!
only person that can make me cry is my mother, my mother is the most terrifying person i know
I love your sensitivity to an overwhelmed mum and not giving judgement like most people do. It's not easy my little boy used to be like Reese hitting me because we had a lot going on at home with moving ect. Now he's a polite 7 year old who I'm teaching how to treat people, animals, even bugs and trees, and who tries to be gentle and considerate to everything. I hope the mum got the help she needed.
Dazzzyyyyyy
Bro ngl I am spank that four year old until he learns you can’t argue with a 4 year old
Omg the dog lol he looks depressed
My mother used to call my full name that’s how I knew I was in trouble
Like little NATZIEZ
Daz how was the cup of tea
It's so nice seeing someone say she's a good mum and is trying her best. Usually people are so quick to judge and with crap like "just hit him back!"
Don't bite your kids, you'll be arrested lol.  If they don't want anything in their sandwich, don't put nothing in it. Simple. If they change their mind, sorry I have shit to do
im glad that the name gizmo lives on with all types of pets :)
this is were the tik tok sound came from (it was the boy say shut up and ##########)
lol that show is so fake
i got one for making friends🤣
its the shoulder pads for me
I’ve fed you, I’ve watered you, 🤔😂😂😂
Make these kids into a anime
The kid :standing on the table screaming   Me:🤩 lion king
Shiniest shoes  Me:🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Andrew rate beats women
So true!!!!
You should watch more
you dont need a super nanny you just need a belt
I would have just walked into that premesis with a sledge hammer and a shovel if I was his mum
People of the UK a big heads up we are being threatened and we may all die Putin has China with them
6:34 there should be a super smash Bro‘s freeze frame right there
I was almost chocking on Lebanese pizza while watching this 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣   MY MUM LITERALLY TOLD ME TO BE QUIET 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 BUT I CANT HELP IT 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Daz knows his shit
"This is like the council state version of Ms. Doubtfire"   You can always count on Daz to say the funniest shit lmao
Love you Dad you’re my favourite YouTuber
Not me crying bc I feel so bad for the mum and the one that actually behaved 😢
8:20
gizmo is very cute
Well? i wouldn’t say lonely single man daz, I’d just say single man with a dog! you have us dazzlers!
The most sane British family.
Thank you for telling everyone that she’s just stressed and it’s not the moms fault
Tea is AMAZING
I give my 5 year old that look when he has an attitude & starts whining, sometimes he just gives me a mean look, but he instantly stops whining lol! All I have to do is just look at him with a blank expression & raise my eyebrows.
I basically had 3 parents for my whole life, My mom, dad, and mamaw. My parents never got married and were very young when they had me so my mamaw always looked after me when they had arguments, or juts wanted spare time for themselves. It's always good to someone with you and help you. Al though my childhood wasn't the very best I'm still grateful for having two parents and my mamaw.
Give the kids a smack that’s what my mother did and ever since then I never stepped out of line kids these days dont get that so they think it’s okay I don’t mean like abuse then I just mean clip them around there head or something enough to hurt a lot and they won’t do it again
Omg my dog's name is gizmo lmao
I think this my favorite Daz video out of all of them, his little comments are hilarious 😂😂😂😂
DUDE THESE KIDS ARE DEMONS I WOULD NEVER BEAT MY OWN MOM
the kiss my willy 💀💀💀
Is it only me who heard the little one saying “Kiss my Willy” in the supermarket
✨Adoption✨
one of these kids has the same name as me and it is slightly disconcerting to hear out loud
i once got a certificate for doing my homework
Wait I thought Linda was your wife? Or am I an idiot I haven't watched you un a while :(
🤨
The 4 year old is the little devil
My mum let me so I understand that but it's just me my dad and my sis and bro and it's hard as I'm becoming a women and never had that real direction on what was happening I just start to bleed mouthly and got a weird talk from my single dad so I understand
1:43 who else thought she was going to kick the cat or tell it to go away
Relocate the child's jaw
Day 1 dad went to get milk day 2 	dad is missing
I realise das when you were impersonating the switching the lights on and off again. You did the gay thing when you flick your wrists. I’m not homophobic just pointing in our. Also in gay hahaha
The official YouTube account has commented on the last 6 daz videos I’ve watched. Whoever runs that channel is a massive dazzler it seems 😂
I can’t drink tea the now tho because I’m in my bed
I’m child
If I was Reece's mum I would've put him up  for adoption or thrown him in a lake.
My mom did the same thing if I bit one of my siblings or one of my siblings but me
a baby is a risk... a health hazard
Daz acts like a combination of my aunt and my english teacher.
you know what would help this? belt.
Which is scarier, a murderous psychopath or a silent, angry mother?
Oohhh my god some kid’s gonna get drop kicked across the living room
bloody jusaess
“Birth control, we all need it”  ..daz?.. you-       w  h  a  t

Orphanage
New super nanny nanny daz
It’s disgusting to see men / dads running away when they hear about pregnancy , very good to hear you being serious and having a genuine chat that will help a lot of people . Luv ya daz
chuck em out
As a child I was quite, lonely and good. My older sister and baby brother would throw tantrums to get the attention. I gave up my mother had and still has mental, emotional and physically ill so at the young age I took care of my mother. Then when I got a little bit older I took care of my nanna who was like a mother to me and then I also cared for my siblings as well.  I lost 2 months of sleep just to make sure my mother and nanna were OK and going to wake up as I saw my mother attempt suicide. The "Mother look" Daz was talking about was a look I did alot to show my mother that some things were not ok. So I don't know if I grew up way to early but I never felt the fear of the "mothers look"
my mum like that but she does the 1 2 3 and then  smack . I'll be in the bathroom  for 1 hour to rethink what i just did.
i was so dumb when i was younger, my mum put me on the naughty step, i aknowleged the fact i could move, and i just sat and waited until my mum came beck, i always behaved better (usually) than my sister, but shes the favourite because shes got no good things about her other than looking better, nd parents like that
I'm your biggest  fan
Daz how to start a video: dog
As someone who is chronically ill and became infertile at a young age, I’m glad.
When I was younger I used to have to stand in the corner on my tippy toes and reach as high as I could reach for 30 minutes if I did something wrong or bad
When I was young if I did something bad my mother would make me watch a video of a woman giving birth untill I apologised she had to do that twice in her lifetime to me
9:00 😂😂
Dog: 👁👄👁  Me: what da dawg doin  Also me: 😅😅😅😅
Mum: ‘He don’t bite.’  ‘YES HE DO!’
The end speech. My dad is gone and that just made me cry. It's kids it effects too. Thank you for this message, Daz. Have a wonderful day!
Dads whole look out for the pregnant girl chat is why I'm waiting til marriage
Daz is flipping COOL!
I thought you said shaging I need to sleep
It's mental that he made a two minute video into a ,15 minute on no complaints though 😂
i would beat them if they every did that to me when i be a parent
0:01 Favourite part of the video
When my dog but my brother my dad biy my dog gently on the ear and he never but again
This Is Mother Abuse
Anyone else realize she didn't shake the little boys hand in the beginning???
bro I slapped my phone so much during this video lmao
7:50-7:51
Someone's gonna get Dropkiked across the living room 😭😭😭😂😃😂😃😂😃😂😃😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
It's working at an elementary school best birth control some kids are just awful
Yes Sir 🫡
My mom used the "naughty spot" with me and my brother (I am now 15 he is now 9) but she doesn't do it with my youngest sister (5 years old) and it really makes me mad. The "naughty spot" worked quite well with me and my brother too.
I’d get in so much trouble if I swear at my mum
There a solution that is called abuse
orphanage speedrun
I don’t really understand the over punishing thing you guys do in America and England. Like you got your playstation taken away for two weeks, that’s a lot. For just pointing your finger to your mum. Im not saying you do it but i hear many stories about especially American peoples childhood and i just think that there parents didn’t really treat them like another person, but just a child that they had full control over and could dictate. I don’t even remember last time my parents and i was in a real argument. I’ve never really got stuff taken away. I understand that if you have a very complicated child you have to do something but i just feel that it often can be overly much.
Might be Irish twins
0:21 the most wholesome and adorable smile
Daz: The Kids going super Saiyan, stands on table like: *YAAAHAHAAAAAA* Gets me every time XD  Its actually *HAAAAAAAA* btw sorry
My aunt would make me do two thing’s  One: sHe would make me drink hot sauce Two: She would Make me do wall sits
Funniest video ever
I flipped my step sis off and she called my mom AND step dad 😭 I was so scared 💀
My mom used to make stand In The corner of the room facing the wall for however long and it never failed to make me listen next time
Hello everybody! I do not want kids and I do not have any, but I am an age regression caregiver! (Age regression is a non-sexual, non-kink coping mechanism in which someone mentally regresses to a younger age to cope with stress, anxiety, trauma, ect.) I personally love super nanny and her advice for when I’m dealing with fussy regressors.
Geezmoo :)
daz whens the day u do a reaction with you holding your dog
The reason they doing this is they don't get corpal punishment and no spank
"Shes got em all lined up.....like little nazis" "AWW..AWW put him in an mma ring" I SPAT OUT MY KOOL-AID LMFAOO
bro when the 4 year old bit the mom I would've grab him by the hair and make him bite himself and say HOW DOES FEEL HUH?! at him
''She's got them lined up like little Nazis'' LOLLLLLLLLLL
wtf
same thing about the biting though I bit my brother and then my Dad bit me
9:57 I CANT  LMFAO
😍😍🥰🥰so funy
I also remember sitting on the naughty spot
I give the mum a month, before she’s dead. 😂😂😂
Bro I bit my mum in public and she bit me back infront of everyone
even his dog looks british
"Look at jo just standing there...... like a curtain"😂😂😂
I’m Mexican and if I acted like this dude I would not be here right now
It's weird we both have the same name for our pet
Daz "just watch super nanny's and you won't won't children anymore" 🤔😂
At that point you just have to start doing WWE takedowns on your children.
Is it just me or does it seem like daz is a really good parent
Is it too late to go to the orphanage
Are the dad just left because of the kids
I would of called the cops on him
Daz: Ahh he's BITING!!!!!!  Me: Laughing my head of.  Daz seems surprised it's like he's never seen a kid bite some one before especially if it's their Mum
FUCKING YOUTUBE COMMENTED
I grew up without my dad who left when I was 4 years old, my mum got a boyfriend who is still my stepdad till this day . They’ve had a son and he has always been there to help her . When they have arguments and he gets kicked out , me and my sister are always there to help her out . I help her calm down when she has panic attacks, or when she’s stressed from the baby . Me and my sister babysit. My older brother tries to help out but he has no clue what to do . It’s hard and stressful to not grow up with a dad for 8 years of your life , let alone he goes to prison and favour his eldest son and not his eldest daughters but in the end he tries to talk to us . But whatever happens in life , there’s always the mum who is still there for you no matter what
w
Daz is the guy that turns a 2 min video into a 15 min one 😂
my lil bro got a certificate for laughing for the first time cus he was a quite kid they thought he was a mute and he wasnt he just didnt like too talk
Gizmo is so cute 😭🙏
So in my primary school we got star awards for like shit being great at math and stuff so my dumbass got an award for going to P.E. 😭🥲
HAhahaha that 4 year old sead kias my willy hahahahahhaabaha
"Some kid's gonna get drop kicked across the living room!" 😂
Does your dog need a step mum
My dad when we’re bad he would put us on top of the freezer so if we tried to get off we would die
Awwwwwwwww
Бяө ҰөҵꚌҵбє дҫꚍҵдꙇꙇұ ҫөӎєҋꚍꚍєԁ
bro when i was 5 or sm i told my dog to piss off and all i heard from the kitchen was " (my name) what did you say to the dog!?" and i knew what i did so i said "i told the dog to piss off.." and i herd her walking to where i was and she said "dont say that again untill your older please" shes not a yelling mother aswell. but now im older i swear a lot and she doesnt care
And here we see for wild mighty bastard
KISS MY WILLY😂😂😂
Reccomend don't watch at 3:19 or you will get grounded 😤
I never liked bad reactions at that age. I’ve always been overly self conscious and, if there was any look, shouting or arguing, I would hate myself. I would think of myself as a failure. That was from about 4 years old
If i say one naughty word to my mom she would slap me put punish me and have no playstation 3 days
At 10:01 he sounds like the bee from the bee movie Larry.
Puppy 🐕
Imagine being dazes neighbor and he records a video at 3 am and just here some random mtfer going hey dazzlers it's Daz like that beghbor be like God I live next to a gay dude lol
Mary Poppins if it wasn't a kids film based on reality
“ look  at joe in corner like a curtain “ it’s gasss I love him
Hahaha ass whooping is coming
She learned the swearing from his mum or dad and probably copying how she and the dad are angry
Then how the hell u got Sarah
your dog is named gizmo mine too hes a chihuahua but he died 15 th may 2022
A family that went to the same church as my family spoiled the hell out of their youngest and he was like this kid, screaming, swearing, hitting kicking like it was bad well one day the mom is fighting her son trying to get him to behave and he spits in her face and starts screaming and swearing and calling her the worst imaginable names In the middle of services. The whole church was stunned as we just watched in horror
I turned on captions and it said “WELCOME TO DADS GAMES”
I would throw them like footballs
God bless daz mom u need kids to sometimes fear u cause if they don’t this is what happens I’ll tell u what if I ever ever swung at my mom my dad would hit me so hard that my jaw would completely fall off idc if it un just sometimes u got to slap tf out of them to relize
dropkick the little b****
She looks like my 5th grade teacher mrs potter 🤨💀
I can't, if I had a kid that was this bad I'd fear I'd smack them on the back of the head especially if they hit me or kicked my legs (I have very weak knees and they buckle with too much pressure) I'd panic
to be honest i call my mum a b!tch and i flip her off i dont really care im not scared of my mum
Dax and me have one big thing in common  *bad kid*=*beat the living shit out of them*
Middle finger from me would be a month with no technology
“ he’s just standing on the table like super Satan like HHAAAAUUUUUUUURRRRRR “ 😭
Who else saw that old TV
I love gizmo
"thats how i get mums attention i RELOCATE her jaw" i cant

Asian mom: let me settle this  HAHHAHAJAJ
“I’ve walked you 🙃I fed you 🤔I watered you 😶‍🌫️” ah yes, don’t forget to water your dog 💅🏼🤌🏼
I would rather fist fight a polar bear than have to stare into the soul less eyes of the mum look

Daz you make me laugh so hard even tho it hurts to laugh since i got my wisdom teeth removed 😂😂
My next door neighbours children need super nanny
only Daz can react to a 2 minute long video and make it 15 minutes long!
Facepunch that child like a Dad and he will shut-up.
Daz was saying about the biting story, that literally happened to me. I bit my dad when i was small so he but back. I never bit anyone again. It works, im telling ya.
Day should have over 20 mil subs bro to good
Did he say he watered his dog !

I couldn't think of doing this to my parents
I got a certificate for being on my phone in middle school

That stabbing weapon is a dart and those things hurt, one got thrown at the dart board but the wind blew it to me right on the shoulder
Wow
At my leavers assembly I got most accident-prone 😐
I love how the nanny just did not do anythin
The camera man be like: 😮 oo this is spicy
Yes and before you say anything yes I’m a lonely man with a dog ok 😳( I wasn’t even going to ask )
This is why I’ll never have kids
When I misbehaved as a child, my mom would have me sit inside this broken wardrobe knowing I would be terrified of it as a form of punishment.  Any time she did that, I would peek my head out and give her cute little smiles and giggles to get me out of the wardrobe, I would see my mom smiling to herself and I would be like “I love you mommy, you’re the best mommy ever” and she would be like “That’s not gonna work, you have 10 more minutes”  I would be in that broken wardrobe for 20 minutes just looking around my room, praying to GOD the wardrobe doesn’t fall on me and kill me 😂
4:13 5:05 5:40 6:35 7:51 8:44 9:07 9:20 11:15 12:08
Belt him he’ll stop straight away
When my dads mad I’m just scared even tho i didn’t do anything LMAOO

13:26 POV:your my mom

This is why I hate kids 😒 😑 🙄 😤 terrible little devils 😈 😤
She has 3 rappters from jurassic Park and one of them is learning to open the door and she holding on for dear life🤣
Ivhave twisted tea for this one 😏🤩🤪
If it’s a one night stand then you can leave
Here’s my biting story! I’ve known my best friend (we’ll call her Addy) since she was born (I’m a few months older than she is). Her mom used to babysit me while my parents worked. When we were really little, probably 2 or 3, she used to bite EVERYONE, especially me. I would come home with bruises very often. Her mom would literally put Tabasco sauce in her mouth on a daily basis to try and get her to stop. One day, her mom and my mom were shopping and Addy and I were sitting in one of those cars that are attached to grocery carts. She bit me and I turned around and punched her in the face. I can’t imagine it was too hard, considering I was 2, but it was hard enough to get her attention. She never bit again and I didn’t get in trouble (or so I’ve been told, since I don’t remember this too well.)
Daz could be the new super nanny 👵
Daz: gives good parenting advice  Also Daz: HANDCUFF HIM
Wholesome content!
☕️🎉💕
It's like a husband beating his wife in 1960
If the kids are biting me that would be fucking hit John will be on his own body bro you’re jumping to be smashed in words and uses the Lemoore yes I will kill the child if a child but it’s me before but if it does this whole sentence with the thing I would do to Charters he bites me
Bro I got most likely to be mayor and he got most shiny shoes I feel accomplished
Can't tell which thing makes me laugh more, Daz jokes or the laugh after the joke 🤣😂
I got my brownie
SLAP THEM!!!!!!!
Omg JUST BODYSLAM THE CHILDREN THAT WILL STOP THEM FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS if you know what I mean
Fun fact when Daz said he had tea and said i have my tea i hope you have yours and i do have tea just infront of me
Those kids need a whooping. usually I wont say that but those kids... omg
BRO AND I THOUGHT I WAS A BAD KID SLAMIN’ DOORS AND STUFF-
If that was me I wouldn’t have a child anymore
Hurting your parents as a child is not normal for asians, if you do that and your parents are Asian they will have two options choose a weapon or remind themselves that they don't have a son.
10:00 😂😂💀 I cant
Bro if my kid gonna try to hit me, like i dont support beating your children, but like a little belt action never hurt anyone
i would have been killed if i slapped my mother
Okay I love the poster in the backround
Earrape time

My mum has 11 children oldest it 18 we are all still like this rip
you have no idea how hard I would have hit the back of that boys head for hitting me  The kid:you fuc- me:🤚
Me personally I wouldn't let that slide
My anger issues could NEVER, now if I was the mum-
Growing up getting a supernanny was a threat
Is it just me or did anyone else's mum fake phone the "police" when you were naughty
Can you please watch more Supernanny.
This is so funny
Daz + gizmo = *perfect*
What youtube hi

“That kid can throw” me be like: that kid can get thrown
My mom would sit on me if I was bad
Hi
his dog is so cute😍😍
Is it just me or is the super nanny kinda hot??
Daz is one of the people id like to sit with, and just talk with him about life... everything about it
Just flog the kids They needs it
Little story: When I was 3 or 2 me and my sister would throw temper tantrums, One day we were at the shops and as soon as me and my sister got out of the store we threw a temper tantrum and then my mom gave us "The Mom Death Stare" and we immediately shut the fuck up and I think that is the only time I threw a temper tantrum, end of story.
Mom “ow!”  Daz: “AHHHHHHH HES BITING!!!”
If that kid started hitting me I would've picked him up with one hand by the neck and ragdoll him across the house
That lil kid be swearing like mad
My old school no joke cave me a certificate for the best imagination. It's soo dumb🥲 I played like a villain from a show was chasing me
Is it sad that the middle child is the best behaved
my parents told me that if I clicked the light switch too much the house would explode. needless to say, I stopped that pretty quick
Ok but if I say that to my mom a would get thrown across the room
How do you laugh so hard you fart that’s how funny he is
wait... i have been giving my dog water.... I HAVE TO WATER HIM
Those were scissors. The little boy threw scissors at his mom
I LOVE THAT DOG HE'S SOO CUTE!

Love da dog
I haven’t watched for a while, but thank god I came across your channel again today. You’re the absolute best, I just love your sense of humour and basically your humanity and humbleness. You’re really great Daz, and don’t you forget it. And thanks for the laughs🤣🇦🇺

I did you know you can use birth control to make your period lighter or not come at all 😇
Honestly i think horse riding is a bit harder than beinf a perent
Daz is basically a dad for younger watchers such as myself
The naughty spot reaaally worked for me haha. Maybe it was because it worked or maybe because I was gullible lol. I can remember thinking I was SUCH A REBEL when I went to the next stair up instead of the bottom one lmao. (great video as always!!!!)
hi
My incentive to not leave the known as a spot or as my parents would call it the corner was because if I left the corner I would get the shit beat out of me so I didn’t leave the fucking corner and it always fuckin worked who wants there ass beat 😂
Yes before you say I am that lonely single man with a dog😂😂😂I'm dying
my mother has the best death stare it scares the living crap out of me
when i bit my sister my mum put chilli in my mouth....never again
The anmount of petience this mom has to not beat the absolute piss outta those kids
Joined 69 uyears ago?
When I was little I vividly remember getting in trouble for yelling against my parents. They hit me with a belt and I laughed throughout it. The belt didn’t work so my mom took it upon herself that if I yelled at her she’s hit me in the mouth with her wedding ring hand. Let’s just say I never spoke out after she hit me once.
Here's an update to my last comment if you have a child that likes to bite even though they're old enough to know better put a dog cone around there neck and put them in a straight jacket that'll make them learn
2:00 Joe mama
1:57 cancer I am cancer
if the kid is doing that the mother should just BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HIM NOT JUST SHOUT THAT HE IS RUDE THAT'S NOT MOTHERING!!!
My dog is named gizmo too😂
if i bite my child that poor kid is going to have a scar there for the rest of his life. I cant use litle sranght its either 100% or nothing 😂
BLUE

Demon kids: boxing their mum  Me: looks at my mum funny  Mum: so you have chosen death
Did I hear that kid say " you f#$king ba#$@#ed" like wth
3 40 i got a certificate for the best hair. i dyed it for like 3 days
Back when I was a kid... Rowdy rambunctious like that and more= belt or switch to the ass, or forceful timeout Cussing= bar of soap to the mouth
Daz: ahhh biting  Him telling him a story of him biting his sister  Also Daz: I thought my daughter was Micheal Myers
Fun fact Daz is young enough to have had a PlayStation when he was young u would have thought he would’ve still played the Wii
No Daz your a single dad with a dog
If they hit the cameraman I can just imagine a kid getting kicked across the room
Gives advice, good parent, nice person…this dude is the best.
My dogs name is gizmo too
i absolutely love how u gave a life lesson for the young men and teens out there but also made the video funny, you are a great man Daz. We love you!!
I’m from the u.s and my mom has the same look lol
i like cheese
Oh my god some kid’s are gonna get drop kicked across the living room LOL
SUPERRR NANNNYYYYYY
Omg when I was younger I always used to get in trouble so the same thing happened to me but I shouted at her and said mum  “I can’t live with you “ and this day that is so mean to say. THANKS DAZ FOR ACTUALLY TELLING SOMETHING VERY USEFUL FOR OTHERS
"ohh my god, some kids about to be drop kicked across the living room"
“AHH!He’s biting!”Killed me🤣😂
The 4 year old : * nom *   Me : he got rabies-
Daz : "THESE KIDS.ARE SATAN"  Me: * brings out holy bible * " exorcism ~ "
One time my little brother bite me so hard it drew blood and bruised for days and my mum told me bite him back so I did(nowhere near as hard as he bite me) and hes never bitten again
7:55 i will pay $5 to see that
I thought you have kids two girls and a boy I love beautiful wife because I hear you scream in someone’s name (* -  *u)
“Like little nazis”                               - daz, 2021
Me: wow…😂
The way they look at you 😂
My mom never put up any of my drawings or certificates
The simple solution is to FUCKING HIT THEM
10:36 I relate to this way to much 😭
Daz your dog is a jojo reference
Shiniest shoes? Hah! I got most likely to drop their phone in the toilet🧍🏻‍♀️
My parents, when I was younger and got in trouble, used to give me an option of taking away my stuffed animal or to get spanked. I always chose the second option
I used to always flip the switches for fun and my mum would get so angry🤣🤣🤣
As a black child I can confirm that this would never happen in my house, she would slap me into the last century😂
Thank god mom raised my brother well.
Aww 💕 so cute
Just imagine toriel of Undertale trying to handle these kids, how long could you reasonably give a goat to turn things around?
Dog is looking 3 different directions and it's cute
Don’t use the lords name in vain
@5:25 my parents did the same thing to make me stop biting my siblings
Slay daz u are my idol
As someone who has a dad that has children from other women it warms my heart that daz is telling younger men to remember if you have a baby at a young age always be there for that child no matter what happens
At 12:53 I would just throw the kid in the lake
Wholesome content 🥹😇🥰
I would've been smacked if I was like these kids
idk why but daz you should be my teacher
I bit my mother she bit me right back and ever since then she would say “bite me” and i would go “i can’t you’ll just bite me right back”    My brother but me mom told me to bite him back ⟟ did and he said “mom she bit me 😩 “ And mom said “did you bite her? 😒 “ brothe went “w-well i mean yeah i guess..” there’s your answer
Bro in my house if you acted like that you’d get back handed even if you’re not my mum and dads child
Daz: Birth Control.. Me: Is now illegal...
you watered your dog? hehe
The Camera man   😎😎😎😎😎😎
The funniest part of this is that this is a tame super nanny video
Hola. Yo soy Dora! Yo tango un largo salchicha esta es mi culo
I hade silent tantrums
Which way is he looking
i feel like if a kid is biting you and stuff take them to a psychologist and get them checked for adhd or smth
Jesse my mom isent like that
like farther like son domestic abuse
I have the best pfp
If that was my kid and he said nothing and was slapping me I would go get some bread on a plate and give that to him what u ordered
there is always the option that a baby could be the end result." remember that.
AAA MY DOG IS CALLED GIZMO TOO?!
With the biting sense you got bit by a mom now you have the mom senses
if they all got a good spanking, grounding and actual repremands for their behavour they would be way better
2:30 and he was right
"AHHH ITS BITING"
"And Joe Frost is dressed as an IKEA couch" had me dying
Bite the little brat back!
To be honest I put myself in the corner and refused to leave
He's the next Mike Tyson
As soon as the kid hit the women in the torso I would have turned the kid around and spanked him so hard he would see his marriage
looks like Mully and acts like mully
Nahhhu mom looks scary but when They say wait till your dad gets back haha going to a new world now
Reason I can’t be a parent: i wouldn’t know how to not hit them back. There for no kids for me
When I was younger I was extremely violent  it was towards anybody but I was never violent to grandma but that was beacuse she strangled me twice with my coat 🤣 I was so bad at primary school the dinner lady person had to pick me up and I was so violent to her, her hair was bleeding.
The naughty corner works if you add a fear factor, like me and my sisters were terrified of the vacuum as a kid so they would put the vacuum close enough to scare us to stay in the corner
Where did LINDA go
Hi gizmo!
the naughty spot did not work for me, lol
5:20 When I was a kid I bit my brother so hard he began to bleed because he didn’t give me a potato chip
If I did this to my mom will get the belt
Bro
...
Fun fact super nanny was found out to be fake and never fixes anything
U can walk out on them my mom did
5:05 6:35
I read on Google that the U.K. kids were told to play up.
2:01 😂
Why is no one talking abt how cute Gizmo is?
My 5 yr old brother isn't like that
If I ever had kids and they were this bad I would put them up for adoption after drop kicking them to the moon
i wound never hit my mum or da
There sponcered by the smurf corperacion
My child will not call the shots on how his life is going to go
When I grew up u eat or go to bed hungry...with my kids I kinda do the same thing but if my child tried to hit ir bite me u getting an ass whopping
“OOOOOOOOOH THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE TIT-“  4:15
How to train your dragon ? No .  How to train your kid ? Yes .
When I get a kid the naughty spot for me is handcuffing my child to the stairs and give them a book for 1 hour  I’m not having it
What’s up my favorite YouTuber Daz
What’s up
What’s up Daz games
My ex left me not long after she was pregnant with my daughter and then she moved to wales but i always 100% do my best to see my daughter my ex has recently given up being a mother and left my daughter at her mums so her mum has the responsibility im moving to wales soon to be closer and my daughter is safe happy and being brought up so well
Hi daz please don't feel lonely you've got us!! Chin up
3:48 that's when I walk away and get my navy boots
Just get a belt
A good slap deals with any kid
it was the sound of music NOT mrs doubtfire
You're also get my boooot!!🤣🤣😡😡 bruh im dying of laughter
I have a crush/GF named Sarah 🤣😂
I love SuperNanny! I love Jo Frost
10:05 swear acc thought this was dragon ball z at first🤣
The one kid who tries to turn super saiayn coz he's angry and ungrateful  Then you get the nice kind polite kid who acc turns super saiayn coz he/she can't handle the other kids BS no more
3:08 I thought he was gonna say somethin else
I just can’t 😂😂😂
Holy shit man crazy children
Man If i was like this to my mom she would back hand me into next week but in all honesty I feel bad for the mom shes a good mom shes trying but what more can you do ?
I should not be watching Daz with A. My dumbass laughing way to easily B. A very shaky squeaky bed C. Someone below me in the house who hears every squeak of my bed
As a kid, the mum look was all that I needed to be humbled. I’d be throwing a hell of a tantrum in a middle of a isle in Tesco, and all my mum needed to do was give me the look with her extra thick eyebrows raised, and I’d suddenly turn from being a a spoilt little shit, to a 4 year old who’s acting like she’s got herself a house in Hollywood, and her life together 💀
Whenever my mom does that I’ll be dead
Do have a daughter
I thought he had a daughter
I had a babysitter and when I acted up she made me kneel down with my hands up for about 2 minutes…..I barley got in trouble again
Sus
that littlest kid swearing
the little devil going to get kicked to the moon
how to be a devil  bite your mother
the little devil is going piss off
lol when the kids have someone there there debil
daz always says im single crist
Bro the mum should of used the belt that's what made my brother to shut up
What went wrong when the dad left
I'm 14 and I already don't want and need kids
I really respect the mom honestly Idc you honestly can’t blame her for these kids’ behaviour
My little bro was the one who took most place in my family because he has anger issues and still have
Hit em that's it
I'm a homosexual so I don't have to worry about kids xD
If that was my mom I would be dead
Bro that girl who wants to kill her siblings need the super nanny
Geez I meant daz
Yo dad can you do some more Supernanny because they’re really funny
Who saw the title of the super Nani video🤣🤣😂
"giz why do you look so miserable" the only thing he is looking at is to opposite walls.
I would have slapped the shit out of the little one
Wow daz is Hilarious
Not always our choice you seem to forget how many these girl do it to them self by stoping the dad from seeing his kid for no reason whatsoever
I remember when I was little, my mom and dad would always put me in the corner and they called it the naughty corner. I was forced to just look at the wall, I would try to make an excuse that I need to go to the bathroom, I would be denied most of the time but when they did let me go to the bathroom, I be in the bathroom for a while then I will sneak away in my room or in my basement then my parents never actually notice lol
I bit my sister and then my mom bit my arm till it bled ;_; she also let my sisters drag me down the stairs by my hair   Mothers are scary when they become unhinged
9:16 god even when anyone just does it i shit myself
I can agree why there is no dad. If you know, you know.
Living in the UK is it just me or is every little shit called "Reece" 🤣
There you go dazz
i don’t have tea does coffee count?
CAN WEE HAVE A TORE OF YOUR HOME
7:56
Fun fact : Daz waters his dog
Camera*
Is the marea man just watching like:😐🤧😐🙄😐😴😐🤨🤨🤔😳😐😐😐😐😐
single lonley man with a dog?? What about you're daughter
My dog's name is Gizmo 😃
Jeez I talk back to my mom and I get b*tch slapped 💀 and this kids just beating her lol
daz: i've watered you  :me you mean i've gave you water
My uncle has that dog with the same name. Btw he's cute
Yes I have my coke flavored tea
Imagine having kids just because you want to be on super nanny
My mom told me she had eyes on the back of her head when she caught me mocking her but I did the fishing reel up middle finger, let’s say my bum wasn’t up to par for a while
Me and my parents had a lot of problems whenever I was little but my goodness, if I so much as raised my voice a little I would get the spoon and an hour in my room.
Bro's dog looks like Iggy from jojos bizarre adventure part 3 😳
When he said not to leave just if you need to like it you to don’t get along and at least still like keep in the children’s life or kid
I’d love to see daz react to the Costello family on super nanny
I didn't get the memo either
POV: watching a movie with daz  2 minutes in the movie pauses daz: what in absolute hell is that the painting on that fridge absolutely sucks little Susan go take art class and why is everyone wearing black is this a hell ceremony Jesus…unpauses
😂100000000000000000000000%
Bro same I bit my mom and she bit me
I would of booted the kids
Please god save this mom Jesus.
did anyone hear the 4 year old in the store say Kiss My Willy.11:28
I don’t get why kids do this stuff
Why does his dog look high
One time my sister tried to throw a weight at me🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why can i relate to this. My sister is the little boy with the sh*tty attitude. My brother is that little b*tch of a girl and i am the quiet little sod in the corner
4:30 little Mike Tyson. Soon he would bite ears off
If I ever acted like this I would be in a coffin in less than 5 mins
"I can see it I'm your eyes" Daz there isn't a thought behind those eyes.
First time my son  bit me, I bit him back. He never bit me or anyone else again after that.
For some reason for me, it is hard to take a British accent seriously and this doesn't help me take it any more seriously.
my sister bit me when she was 5 yr
gizmo is actually adorable
"You'll also get 👹MY BOOT👹" has me DEAD 🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀
im wearing blue as im watching this
The same thing basically happens to me I'm the older and my cousin who lives with us takes the attention while being a chaos and we live with just my mum
i could never be a super nanny bc id just be laughing my ass of
Whenever someone says not to spank your kids, show them super nanny. They'll change their mind
i dont get this show cuase if the nanny dont do nothin whys it called super nanny???
dog can see ghost
kids where tag teaming
I love your dog
Is it just me or does the dog look just like iggy. 0:12
BRO THAT LOOK FROM YOUR MOM WAS A WEAPON THAT WAS BANISHED FROM EARTH
My mom did the same thing in the same scenario, I bit my sister so my mom but me to let me know how much it hurt, I never bit anyone again
Bro when das did the look it gave me ptsd
Daz: gives good advice Me: Ur getting disowned, Ur disowned, And ur disowned
bro my mom would beat the fuck outta me
Bruh just yeet  that lil shit in the water 😂😂😂😂 no but fr don’t do that even if there spawns of satan ngl I don’t even think satan can handle them   Lol
7:41
11:28 "You can kiss my willy' 😂😂😂
Just slap him
I bit my brother once. Took a chunk out of his back. I was 5
I love how you turn a 2 minute video into a 15 minute video
you didnt watch the whole episode the short videos are kinda like a preview for the longer ones
doggy
Do you have a child
The kids are normal they just need something. That is a beating
0:03 your dog is so cute, i had one just like him/her
Nice cat 👍
#YouTube
Daz comes up with great advice  Also daz " that boys gonna get drop kicked across the room
daz i realy like your vidios
I have a margarita instead of tea 😂
No one daz: I’ve watered him
i love you daz you're genuinely such a good man <3
I want to know how the 4 year old child learned to swear
The ominous stare of death
Daz is amazing he made a 2 minute video 15 minutes and so entertaining definitely more entertaining then the original video
🤣 lol
You're a good bad. ADOPT ME
0:00 Dazz’s Dazzling Dawg
Daz never fails to make me laugh 😆
Omg the puppy is so cute awwwww
I’d prob boot the back of the kids leg and  tell him that’s how I feel
I love how honest he is
If i ever hit or bit my parents like that. i would get a slap and a factory reset.
Bro that story about when you pointed the finger at ur mom got me on the floor laughing
If i did any of that my mother would slap me to heaven and back
I bet kaisys the favourite
when daz gave the silent mum look, I got ptsd
meanwhile Jeremy kyle has now quit his job after watching this woman
That moment when timeout was getting locked in the car...
I found out what he thru at here it was a dart(I can tell by the little fuzzy bit at the end) yes a dart
"All her hopes on super nanny, Joe Frost" Daz: "And Joe looks like an Ikea couch"
Not me think w does shiniest shoes certificate
Bro… she wasn’t but by another mom… SHE WAS BIT BY A CHILD
when moms start looking you up and down, thats when you know you messed up.
Average British family
His story about his mum was Brill. If there's one mum you don't piss off, it's a Irish one 🤣
7:56 oh some kid  is going get dropped kicked across the living room got me dying 😂
I love your  dog 🐶🐶🐶🐶😍😍😍
18:56 I am gay so if a baby does come out I'd be very concerned
Honestly though handcuff him 😂. If they slam the door take the door off, if he hits take him to time not as punishment it's for you to take a breath and not beat them out of anger Spankings depending on your child might be helpful it's all about knowing your child. My brother was insane and would laugh if spanked  Sometimes you just need to take stuff away
Haaa we little NAZIS 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
Every time I watch daz’s videos I always say the same things he does before he does like a second before
YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER NOT JUST GISMO
When I started getting my teeth at like 10 months I bit my mum on the sholder just testing what I could get away with but I bit her so hard it drew blood and then she bit me back
we got nanny mcfee over here
My mom bit me to 😂
When i was 5 i used to hit my mom now that im 17 i feel eternal guilt about it
sometimes it’s hard to believe this show is real and not staged it’s so insane
Oh someone is going to get dropped kicked across the room 😆🤣😂😹😆🤣😂😹😆🤣😂😹😆🤣😂😹😆🤣😂😹😆🤣😂😹😆🤣😂😹😆🤣
Hey I know you will not read this but I will always love watching your videos when I'm sad mad happy sorry to be that person who is so i don't know I'm sorry
get a dog cam 0:30
Take a shot whenever daz says pig! 😂 I would be drunk already 😂😂😂😂
At 7:57
STOP
Love the videos but please please stop saying math...its maths or mathematics, don't take on the American way please fella
The best line of the century - wholesome content- and-BITE HIM
The thumbnail is hilarious- just Daz looking off vacantly into the distances while flipping the wall off😂
He literally made me cry at the end cause I have tryna of my dad leaving me and me and my mum who can barley afford to live her life
“Kiss my willy!” 💀💀💀
Daz is such a good guy, like what he said about taking responsibility is just so nice to hear. I know a lot of men think the same way, don’t take me saying this as I don’t believe that. It’s just always nice to see people like this. Kudos to Daz for giving that talk to his potential viewers as well.
his stern mother scared the shit aotta me
cute dog
This is why kids need both a mum and a dad under the same roof
11:19 “HAND CUFF HIM” 💀💀💀💀💀
He watered the dog
when having sex there is always the risk on a baby  Not If Your Gay
Daz is right this indeed is the best form of contraceptive. I now know that I never want children 😬😒
It’s no longer super nanny it’s super Dazzy
You have kids?
Daz: Birth control we all need it-" Me: eminently google what happens when a man takes it what happens:  the development of breast tissue, wider hips, reduced facial hair
“Some kid is gonna get dropkicked arcross the living room”
I don’t drink coffee I’m a kid
Daz u should see my baby brother he would beat the living shit out of anyone he does not give a single shit at all
0:10 not a single coherent thought behind those eyes
Daz: “ I walked you, fed you and watered you”   The dog: 🪴
Daz: there is always an opportunity to get a girl pregnant. Me a homosexual
Hahahagag u have made me crease
Bro I bought your pink Bennie it looks sick I love it👍
Supernanny
When she gets bit by the little kid punch him in the forehead
13:56  Me: Well I'm gay, so all I have to worry about is STDs  Protection is always important people! And if you do get someone pregnant, help out with the kids if they decide to keep it!
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Kid is from dragonballz
I to love watering my dog.
My mom would beat the shit out of those kids
Little nazis. - Daz Black

My riggidey roo haw friends, you need to backhand the child when they scream, or put a pipebomb in their lunchbox  Rut roh raggy
Gizmo is so adorable! What breed is he if you don't mind😅
The dad didn’t want to pay child support so he went to go get the milk
I haven’t got my tea I’ve got my vimpto 😎👌
good parenting advice
Giz supremacy
If you water the dog long enough, will it turn into a dog plant?       Lol
daz your so funny
Your mom is a psychopath😂
I saw the dog I liked
Daz: oh my god some kids gunna get drop kicked across the room😂😂😂😂😂
My dad would beat those kids to death and i am not saying the figuratively
5:14 I bit my brother when I was little and he was bleeding my brother is older than me tho I still got told of lol
Good vid
Hiii
Dog. So. Cute
the 4 year old kid sounds like he having a mental brake down
As soon as i saw the hitting i thought... ADOPTION NOW
Daz please  watch  the sun and moon show
i never made my mom mad, because she can handle jokes and stuff and i was not a terror kid, but as soon as i said something to my mom she didn't like, you already regretted it, just by the look she gave you. also who wants to hurt their mom? they are the reason you still live
I so grateful that daz not only is so considerate of how the mother must be feeling he also tells a very important message that dads should step up! I gave birth at 17 and my childs father has been nothing but a nightmare. I was with him for 3 years and he had never used protection. I just dont understand how these people live their lives knowing they have children and not doing anything to help support them in anyway. Daz your so incredible and I'm very grateful for what you say in your videos. This makes me feel so much less alone.❤
I got a certificate for participation…. It was a math triathlon
7:21 Mum:no Kid: *turns into a car*
Do gizmo looked high
Me and my siblings were one this show onece it is all for show everything she does at the time it worked a little but a lot of the being good was us having to act and after she left everything went back to how it was before she didn’t change a thing and it essentially just us I have seen other people around on places who say the same thing
I was spanked. I turned out fine. (I think.) SPANK. THE. CHILD.
LITTLE NAZISSSSSSS
You aren't wrong Daz😅....only difference is the look in my moms eyes was three times worse...
13:45 thank you Mr Daz for this thoughtful advice, and I can gladly assure you that scenarios is of no threat to me 😅
6:41 ayo!!???
My brother is one of the worst kids about this he is almost 10 and he is so mean to me and when I hit him back he gets so mad and I don’t even do it hard 😂 he does nothing around the house because my parents are Divorced and I mostly live with my mom because I’m 14  my brother does have and have  (sat-wed at my dad and the rest with my mom) he plays games and does nothing he is failing the 3rd grade and last week he tried choking out a girl at recess!😳he got grounded for 3 days 😒 while I’m part of the student council, straight A student and I’m the “bad kid” for forgetting to do the dishes. Not to mention we have to share a room! I have no personal life and all my mom does is “I had to share a room with my 2! Sisters!” And leave it be. Any time I get to make a comeback about him acting up I’m the bad guy. So watching this is miles compared to the stuff my 10 year old brother does. Not to mention my mom obviously have a favorite, my little brother, but that will never change
𝕀 𝕔𝕒𝕟𝕥'𝕥 𝕤𝕥𝕠𝕡 𝕝𝕒𝕦𝕘𝕙𝕚𝕟𝕘😂😂😂
I’m waiting for her to slap him
Yourbmy favorite youtuber
I feel like I was the only child that wasn’t aggressive to my parents but a demon to all 3 of my brothers
Daz always has the best TEA
beat the shit out of theme and theyll stop
"Oh, that was right in the tit!" Had me wheezing for 10 min😂🤣
When you are a Child watching this 😂
Li'lle nazis 😃😂
Iggy!!!
daz wasn't wrong tho one day the kid will do that to the wrong person and get drop kicked
daz
DAS make a business call the dazzling nanny
tbh if a child was using me as a punching bag  I will wear a shirt saying something like "Hit me If ur stupid"  And treat them nicely
“I’ll relocate her jaw” 😂
not my mom in my family she threatens to call my aunt
As someone with 3other siblings and would regularly be left alone with them I'm lucky enough to be able to diffuse a situation instead of hitting each other id throw them a ball and screw a laundry basket that doesn't have a bottom to the wall and use it as a basketball hoop the used it nearly every day till we mooved
Well good thing I ain't havin kids, but in case I do I'll just be hearing  *HANDCUFF HIM*
One word…leather😰
The certificate thing for me was just because i always had a pe kit
Iggy from jojo
You are not rong
I grew up without a dad ... and honest because of what I've been through I don't want one  seriously men no matter how you do it don't leave someone you could maybe impregnate because there's always a child who has to suffer :(
I loved how he started the vid talk about birth control
No offense, but best the kid with a belt
that mom look is so FUCKING TRUE!
Why is your channel called dazGames when you don’t game
I bit a kid at the age of 6...  mum bit me right back, I didn't do that again. Seems like daz and I have something in common 😂
Life moral: do not drink tea while watching Daz, there's more tea on my floor and phone than in my mouth or mug...
The dad went to get the milk
My daughter has adhd & dmdd which is disruptive mood dysregulation disorder which means the child can’t regulate their emotions their frontal lobe doesn’t work like it should and the amygdala runs on over drive and it makes their anger over react. Its like an adult driving in a car and the brakes don’t work. In the end causes a child to use their fight or flight response which can either be run away & hide or they stay and fight and my daughter has yelled/cussed, hit, bit me, has thrown things. it started when she was 2 yrs old. We got her diagnosed at 6 and with medication has gotten better but from age 2 & up I literally tried every type of discipline you can think of and it didn’t work I have to let her go thru the rage and then once it’s over I hand out the consequences. Kids with dmdd their brain doesn’t work properly. I’m not saying the kid in video has what my daughter has but normal discipline you would use on a neuro typical child doesn’t work on a child with dmdd. So please if you do see a child acting like this in public don’t assume the parent is bad at parenting cuz you don’t know if that child has a mental health issue and you don’t know what that mom/parent goes thru. If you want more info look up Dmdd on YouTube or of course google.
my mom did that too
Bless the mom
When your kids mad at you you shouldn't say YOUR RUDE are the kids will feel more bad so they will get more mad
That 4yr is trouble
Gizmo is so freaking cute!
my mom tried spanking and stuff she said the only thing that worked with me as a autistic was putting all my stuff where i couldn't get to it, she said she could have beat the shit out of me and i wouldn't have cared as long as i had my stuff lol,   PS. she did not beat on me. don't want that to be taken the wrong way lol
Ohhh i remember being a handful of a child when I was younger- but I don't think I was THAT bad
Adoption centre
I LOVE UR DOG
And now years later Supernanny is still ate it 🙂
Dam daz really be teaching us alot in one video
First time here. Daz your amazing and I can’t go 10 seconds without wheezing endlessly. I need someone to clip these videos. “Something about her facial expressions” 🤣🤣🤣
OMG IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!
Watching this while my sister is attacking me💀
Sorry to offend you but u can be twins even if 1 is older than the other
How is the dog daz also I saw you on TV like March or something congratulations.
ur not lonely, u have us
Basically the solution is to just not have kids lol
I know this was 7 months but it does make sense my mom had 5 kids and i was middle child and I was on the receding end of her abuse i don't know why she abused me but her husband died when I was baby so i think that was done to the abuse and I tryed my best when I was a kid and it wasn't good enough then my little half brother came along then he was treated like the golden star and tbh that did not please me what so ever
can i just say... if those were my kids, i would be in prison for life because of three murder charges... 🙂
Supper nanny is my birth control
He’d be a good therapists
I remember when I was younger I would leave the water running all around the house because I knew my mom paid the water bill. I feel so horrible for it now. Also, at the time no one knew a pipe was leaking, so her water bill was way higher even without little me running it up. I'm so glad I got over that stage. Now we actually know how to talk things out and give each other space which I'm very glad for.
if i was the mother in that situation where my child would try to hit me, that kid would either be long dead or would fly out the fucking window
I’m so sorry daz I’m a huge fan but I don’t like tea, if I got invited to a tea party u set up I would gladly go, I would drink the tea anyway but as long as it’s sweet
i remember the first time he got gismo and that he is so big alredy is so sweet to me :> <33
The children scare me 😶
The mom look is always terrifying... Especially coming from a Spanish mom as a kid lol
Daz once said:  ‘Aww they’re all lined up like nazis’
7:56  😂😂
The bit where he says oh my god some kid is gonna get drop kicked across the living room 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Daz: Yes, I am that lonely single man with a dog.   Also daz ***Has a literal child????***
Why do I feel like the boy probably has bad adhd or something like that
i would smack the shit out of those children if they put hit me once i would hit with the KAMMAHAMMAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
B i t e   t h e   c h i l d .
Lets play a game of yeet the toddler into the dump
I wanna video just of the dog
“welcome back to another daz watches … BIRTH CONTROL “  ✨best intro ✨
Daz: you will get that BUT YOU WILL ALSO GET MY BOOT 🤣
The advice on being responsible is very important advice... It makes me so angry when a man walks away from a woman after he's got her pregnant because he either wasn't ready, was afraid, or just didn't care. And she's left to raise the kid, some without the help of others. It's hard on the mum, and it's hard on the kid who has to face life without the other half that brought them into this world. My dad was never in the picture much because he had a problem with alcohol addiction, and my mom had to raise me with the help of my grandmother and my aunts. My younger sisters dad dipped as soon as he found out he got my mom pregnant. She resents her dad for leaving. Wouldn't even answer the phone the day my mum was giving birth. He pays child support, but only because he's required to. And he's done this to a few other women; knocked them up and dipped out. My exes younger brother knocked up a few different girls and from what I heard, he's sometimes around for only one of the mothers. I met a guy online back in December and we fell in love pretty quickly. When we got onto the topic of having sex, I asked him what his thoughts were on contraceptives, he said he wouldn't be willing to wear a condom because he wouldn't be able to feel anything, but advised I go on birth control. That didn't sound right to me, and maybe it sounds a little weird. He and I aren't talking anymore because of some "distancing issue" he wouldn't clarify with me about, even when I tried asking so I could understand what he was going through. After talking with my co-workers about it, they suspect he's just bullshitting his way out of the relationship. I'm glad we never met up and had sex, cause if I got pregnant and he "grew distant", I would be angry. Even more so if I found out he was sleeping with others.  Sorry for the long rant, but the idea of a man leaving a woman after he got her pregnant makes me angry.
You are hilarious my friend! Your videos made my day better
7:20 I mean I grew up without a dad and I’m fine 🤥 *Looks at username and profile picture* Yeah…fine 🙃
4:15 5:05  together sound wrong💀
How the fuck did she get them to stand stil in the start? 😥😆
Lol
The worst thing abt daz channel is that he can’t just be fracking quiet and listen he can’t just watch the video all he does is scream and talk every 5seconds😕
Daz said bloody Jesus like this BLOO-DY  JES-EUS
Awwwww your dog so FACKIN cute
🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
YOU..... HAVE.... A..... DOG!??
My mom did something similar where she would purse her lips and her eyes would kind of get a little more wide. Unfortunately for me it was when she yelled that there was no hope for life.
Or you beat the shit out of them alike my mom did me I learned and learned fast
Solution: *LOCK THEM IN A CAGE*
I love my little cousin, she is an angel... or so I thought. She was always so cute and adorable,  until i found out that she threatened one of her friends that her grandad was going to get his gun and shoot them. The girl is 5. FIVE.
Daz should react to Brandon Rodgers lmao 🤣
Spank them 😭

My mom gets inspiert by super nany and i love your videos sooooo..........GOOD COMBO
Adoption
I’ve got tea rn
Paddle time
No Dying u just fucked up
What Daz says at the end about men being responsible for the children they help make, is honestly one of the many reasons I love watching him and enjoy the things he says. Not only is he hilarious and makes me wet myself with laughter, but he’s extremely clever and down to earth man. Xx
if I was like that kid my ass would get slapped whopped hit with a cord and a slipper uh a punch
hold up, did he name his dog Gizmo like the cat in Sally Face? 😂 amazing game :) and adorable pup ❤️
Brooo if I was to do that to my mom she would un alive me at the spot
Pls dont insult the colour blue... all i have is blue 🤣🤣       By accident funnily enough 🤣🤣
The 4 yr old is over 9000

Daz: Get that boy trained that was a thump  Me:🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

I don’t have tea but I’ve got coffee
This video needs a part 2
https://youtu.be/kq20AgoVta8
Anyone know if there’s an update on her or the kids?
The name changes from Daz games to gizmo games

I got a certificate for writing on the black walls in black because I ‘painted in a dent ‘ in the wall
I got my ass beat by mum and dad.
Are they Australian? That would explain that boys naughty mouth
Sent this to my mum she’s having trouble with my brother he’s 8 he’s swearing hitting being such a little shit I’m worried my sisters will copy she shouts and does the things this woman is doing told her I’m not criticising her or judging or anything I’m just trying to help her and told her to watching this when everyone’s at school x
How’s it going dazzlers welcome to another daz games and a nother daz whatches  he should get rid of daz whatches and replaces it with and a nother lonely man with dog whatches 😂🤣😂
Parenting tips with Daz: fuckin bite him
6:29 the little girl in the background with her brother was so sweet
when she was walking by the bridge and holding her kid like that i thought to myslef for a second that she was gonna throw him in....😭
Is your kids name Linda or sara
New advice to parents: HANDCUFF THEM!
Literally so sad for the mom and the oldest girl who doesn’t get attention from her mom.
I would back hand these f*cking kids
Awww omg I have a dog Gizmo too lol 🤣
I used to watch super nanny so my family seems better
TIME OUT BUCKET!!
11:28 Anyone realise he said "Choke on my willy" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was playing minecraft during this video and I got a cave sound right at 9:16
Bro... My sister was violent when she was like 6 or 7 and my parents were just patient about it. But when a fucking kid thats like 9/10 years old goes to slap her mum, you need to fucking do something about it. I can deal with my 4,5 or 6 year old kid kicking me in the leg but if an older kid goes for my head he gonna get worse than grounded.
“F*CK OFF YOU BASTARD” ~~Reese, the four year old.
If it were me the adoption forms would have already been signed or I would actually throw hands you wanna act grown I’ll show you grown
I would just adopt them tbh
Reece jeez mate😂😂😂🤣🤣
"Suck my willy" daz: it's actually quite normal give him an inch they take a mile 🤣
The 4 year old I would punt like as a football
coffee, not tea, cause i’m australian
When I have kids if the ever try and hit me we will through hands until they learn there lessons 👊👊
MY COMMENT WITH 600 LIKES WAS DELETED
7:42
That’s when you know you should start practicing hand shakes with the devil
I swear if that were my sons i would abandone thwm or just spank them
“Alright and that’s what you’ll get, your also get MY BOOT!!!!
He really said “ and joe is dressed like a ikea couch” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I died laughing when he said"She has them all lined up like little Nazis😂
“My god he’s adorable but I bet he’s the worst one.”   Rhys: *screams, swears and bites his mum* How did Daz know?! Neither he’s super insightful or he got off lucky!
Lined up like little nazis 😂😂😂
My moms Italian, if I even THOUGHT about raising my hand to her she would've sent me to the moon
the angry mom stare is the scariest thing someone could ever experience. A gun to your head? nah. Angry mom stare? Hell ya.
The thumbnail alone already has me rolling. 😆
I would've been beat so fast
"AAAAHHH HE IS BIITING!!!!#
TEA PARTYYYYY
Lol, dog is SUPER DOGGG
This is a full time mom.... And a punching bag
I’m a kid, but when I’m a parent, if I have a kid like that 4 year old. I wouldn’t hesitate, i will put them up for adoption
I would ship those kids Madagascar.
" ohhhhh mY gAwD sOmE kId iS gOnnA gEt dRopPeD kIcKed aCrOsS tHe LiViNg RoOm-" * normally carries on*
Daz: Hes so cute but i bet hes the worst one  Famous last words Mr Daz
The girl full on will smithed the mum
once I bit my mum and drew blood👍💀
“There all lined up like little natzies” haha you heel all depression lol
No one makes me laugh like u do daz😂😂
gizmo is literally the cutest thing 😭
If I was the mom I think I might've resorted to adoption or I would've duct taped them to a wall by now
“That was a slap!”  Me if I ever did that to my mom: K.O flawless victory!
I’m in human anatomy and I made my entire class laugh saying: “I armor up with Nexplanon!” While flexing my arm with the implant
That's why it's called a vasectomy
The first fucking word that isn't the intro or him playing with his dog is birth control
I was waiting for Daz to say: GIVE THEM UP FOR ADOPTION!!!!
RIGHT IN THE TIT 🤣🤣🤣
(Reese) shut up *****  (daz) oh my God someone’s going to get dropped it across the living room😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 that is one of my favourite weirdo youTubers 😍 and thank you for making these videos because they make me  entertain me
Jesus
Why ur dog look up higher than the sky bro
Daz: *Shouts very loud*  His daughter: Why is dad screaming again?
When I was a child on the naughty step they put child gates around me so I was trapped there 😀
I watched a few super nanny episodes on YouTube and next thing I know I had so many UK shows on my recommendations. I’d love to see Daz react to how clean is your home. He’d have a good time with it.
This made my day
Bro I have the same type of dog except mines a blue Boston terrier, he died a few weeks ago tho :(, but we still have another boston terrier ( I think it’s like a red one) he has these cool tiger stripes but I still kiss the old guy alot
If my kid swears like this I'm getting the dish and laundry detergent cus that works and I know it does cus it happened to me
I also flicked my mom off but never got caught and i stopped doing that whenever she turned i went "🖕👿🖕" and cursed but mumbled so she wouldnt hear me.Thankfully i never got caught and stopped doing that💀
It's the moms fault she needs to give them a whooping
My face is contraceptive enough 😂😂😂
This whole video of super nanny is my family right now except I'm 14 my brother is 13 and my sister is 7 and she gets mad easily and my know I have to deal with it until I'm out of high school
My mom just slapped the shit out of me
Dad when to get the Milk
I would have lost my patience
When I was three I was at an airport with my mom and I bit her so she bit me and I never buy another person again
I like your videos🤣🤣😂😂
Daz: PULL MY HAIR BACK AND PUT ME IN BLUE!  Also Daz: GIVE ME THE JOB!
Best intro on YouTube
I love daz but I don't like tea what do I do?!!
This is why i dont want a child
My mum and dad took lessons from Supernanny because my sister was very sad and now she’s a living breathing vampire😅
Raise your hand if you would get slapped if you hurt your mom like that
Bro I want to kick all of the kids I. The chest
thx for the advice about babies when im old enough will keep that in mind.
"mum ' was promoted to party leader.
me sees the title:🫣 methinking what it was 💪👩‍🦱
Bro imagine the kids watch this back when they grow up and realize that the mom said “I want to just leave them”
🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Put the child up for adoption quickly before it’s too late!
Nothing else to do
I would adopt hime
11:28 lol did he just say kiss my willy?
I cant help in this situation
Belt the only solution 👍🏼
I love watching you’re videos and how have a dog named gizmo too
Lets just say, the "Mum look" can almost be more terrifying than anything in that moment when you KNOW you've messed up-
Can we have a w for his dog and him being the best w w w w w w w
😂😂
that’s what my cousin does She literally uses gel and pulls back her hair like you can like see her scalp trying to hold onto her hair follicles
If I hit my mom she would have killed me
Daz: yes, before you say it, i am that lonely man with a dog lol  That fans: no shit
imagine this a black super nanny.....
Yk what’s funny, that 4 yr old is probably 20 now
If I was that four year old, I wouldn't be able to get bastard out my mouth, Cause I'd be dead.
Your dog
Is so cute see you have 215k
I would pull out the belt
If I acted like that my mum would beat so severe I would be traumatized
Man daz I’ve been so sad over the last week and your videos have helped so much every night i laugh at your vids and forget the sadness I love you so much and what you do you inspire me a lot thanks
If I acted like that I would get my soul ripped out of my body and THROWN into hell by my mom. Just beat the shit out of the kids. They’ll act straight then
His dog is so freaking cute!!!
A slap that can even make will smith
3:55 She just Will Smithed her son
does gizmo have insta
Daz do you have adhd not to be rude but you get distracted a lot like me I have adhd to
OH MY GOD some kid gonna get dropped kicked across the living room
My anger issues could never
Last time a kid Smacked me in the face, i told his mom what he did. but His mom does not care and continued reading. after a long time of ignoring. Next thing i knew i performed Harai Goshi on the kid. (Thankfully we are in a inflatable park) I was 8 at the time. Now I'm 17.
When I was a kid if I was sent to the naughty step it was for hours. We’d sit there for hours and we WOULDNT DO THE THING WE WERE PUT THERE FOR AGAIN 😂
I love that your dog is called gizmo that’s such a cute name 🥰😂
If I was put on the naughty step I would just sit there and cry I was a very stubborn kid 😂
if i were the mom: lift the 4 year old and drop him, lift the 7 year old and yeet her across the room. and then leave the house, change name and phone number
I would put them for adoption
Ye silent mother equals death
man if that was my son i wouldve floor him and say calm down or u get a punishment
Daz I just used to hit up off the naughty step and went to my room with my little alarm on my door so I just went in , typed the code then typed it in again to lock it then it would beep when my mum would try and get in
12:32 reminded me of turning off the extractor fan to make the solar energy spike randomly lmao
Dad went to get the milk
If I did what the kids did I wouldn’t be alive
I love how he still makes us smile and laugh but he is very caring at the same time❤️
This is a accurate description of Australia.
the baby is king kong
He talks too much
How about call it Latin mani I’ll give it an hour and those kids are going to be angels
Why do I find Reece funny…someone please don’t allow me to be a parent
The naughty spot for me was a princess chair. It sort of worked. I was a brat. I would scream and hit. Not as bad as these kids though. Like holy shit. I only was a brat because to be honest my parents often didn't care. They didn't care about me. I was bratty and screaming at my parents to bring me to fun places because those fun places were the places my parents and I has the most good memories.
the 4 year old looks like putin
Where is the Supernanny?
So she can have an abortion if she wants or keep it but I don't get to decide and I have to be there? fuck that man
My cat is name gizmo
2:00 lol
The 4 year old should be in wwe
At this point i would not give a shit about the laws and beat the living shit out of these kids
Your hilarious
Dude at 7:20 it was so fun y when the mom went no and the kid went AHH
Has daz played sally face ????
Ooooh some kids gonna get drop kicked across the living room

I’m related to super nanny lmao.
She should of said turning devil's into delights
Nah I used to get whooped with belts😭 what is thissss💀
Ok but my sister is probably worse than that boy sometimes 😭😭
I was most of the time taller den my mom
This mom needs to know if your child hits you hit him back harder it’s self defence and it would not count in the child abuse law
AAAAAA HES BITEING😭😭😂😂😂😂
my only words for this video is daz is a legend keep it up 👍
ok but where is the flip-flop at 😐😐
no there is something scarier than an angry mom an agnry grandma
Im dead “omg some kid is gonna get dropkicked across the living room” 💀💀💀
I mock my mum to
Also daz is very nice about what he says
I love how daz is so funny and has great humor and makes everything hilarious 😂😂
I got a certificate for the longest legs🤣

When I was younger I was sent to the naughty step/ naughty spot and I was sooo bored. So I snook upstairs to grab something. I came back down and sat there. Next thing I know my mum Is standing there watching me and I realise I fell asleep. When I snook upstairs what I grabbed was a spiderman blanket😂

I love how Supernanny is just standing there at the start watching the mum and kids having a fight
Wait y’all actually did it I thought it was a joke
Daz if u were a nanny there will be no kids left they’ll all have bite marks
Daz talking to his dog:why yuh look so upset I've walked u I've fed u I've WATERD U
Why is the merch so bloody expensive?
The nanny in the corner looked like Mrs trench ball😂😂
My dad would Whoop my ass if I did any of this

“Little Nazis” i just imagine them doing the Hitler Salute and all and yelling “HEIL HITLER”
I was yelling spank him/her the whole time😂

Mike Tyson get your son
6:55 "That's how I get mum's attention, I relocate her fuckin' jaw."
Desaplen that what they need
OMG! That is the cutest dog ever and i don't really like that breed of dog. Soooo cute.
Daz:" yes I'm the lonely man with a dog "   Sarah: WHAT AM I A ROACH
im still a kid but i was a little raging monster when i was younger like if hulk got mad just without all of the strength  i became the scariest person at my school because admitedly i got into a lot of fights and beat the hell out of everyone it got so bad that a police officer talked to me i was 7-9 during most of it  but im fine now got good anger management lessons and im basicly harmless
The hole time lissening the e what you had to say at the end was kinda sad to me because my parents had me because my mom wanted to trap my dad because there relationships was rocky and they were going to split but then I happened so my dad stayed but then they got in fights to the point they both left me
My mum has 5 kids HAHAHAHAHA
if i ever raised a finger at my mom like that i would have gotten beaten with everything in the kitchen !
11:28 he said kiss my willy 😆
“ Like little Nazis “ I can’t 😂😂😂😂❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Daz: There all in BLUE but i mean there in school uniform Me: Yeah but their mother is out of the blue
You said u have tea and hope I have mine and  I said no I hate tea and I’m sick so I’m sticking with water
I Watch supernanny so when i grow up and have kids i can teach them to be nice and discipline them the right way
Also daz: handcuff him
The look is everything
🚭
Let me tell you, I would never freaking dare bite one of my parents. My dad would have clocked me so hard, I would not have remembered who I was.
My dad used to restrain me thays allowed its not abuse
ohh god if they were my kids theyd be in the adoption centre with handprints on their face
I feel bad for the neighbors
"Be a man" is a meaningful saying. A man is someone who stands up to challenges and pushes their way through. Someone who does anything in their power to hold up the well being of their family before themselves.
"Birth control, we all need it" lmao  Men AND women need to be responsible for their actions and take sex more seriously.
You should be a comedian!! 🤩🤩🤩
if that wass me to my mum my mum will get the teetowl ready
Ahhhhh he’s biting
Daz drinking his copeing tea
“She’s got them all lined up… like little Natzis”  -DazGames

My dad got the milk
OMG THATS WHERE IT CAME FROM- Ma favourite meme 🫠
Throw the child
Love you daz
Kiss my Willie 😂😂😂
My mum would rarely shout out me 0-6  then as soon as I miss behaved 6-18 I was fucking screamed at…
I dont think ppl realize u dont need an entire super nanny to handle bad kids, its called discipline, spank the little bastards
Just slap the kids
Love the dog. 🤣🤣😂😂🐶🐕
We have to remember that daz’s mom is South African, bliksem!!🤣🤣❤️
Bro i laugh so hard when you talking about your mom yelling you to clean your room😂😭
Listen as an adult if I decide to have kids I will just take handcuffs and make them stay in one spot. I thought of this before he said it lol
“And I didn’t have a PlayStation for two weeks” Scariest part about that story /lh (lighthearted)
My cats called gizmo lol
DAZ: AND JOE FROST IS LOOKING LIKE A IKEA COUCH
When I saw the part where she was carrying the boy near the river my little sister said "chuck him over the ledge" and she's 11 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
No but why is it whenever daz says Linda I think: blond, skinny woman with circle glasses and she’s tall
Daz: EVERYTHING IS BLUE Me: there in uniforms I don’t have to where one to school and my school bag has blue on it and I have school tomorrow and blue is the colour of Monday
The 4 year old literally said kiss my Willy when they were in the super market

The tantrums are contagious 😭😂😂😂
I had a naughty step at my grans house

Once I slammed the door multiple Times, my mom slammed the door in my fucking face I never done it again😂
When Daz dose the mum look my hart     Started beating faster
I remember as a child my mom putting me in the corner, anyone else's mom do that? Anyways. She puts me in the corner cause I did something I don't remember but then she walks into another room I walk out of the corner she has her Spidey sense thing and gives me THE LOOK and I'm like sorry mom I'll go back
Daz is the absolute funniest youtuber ever😂
The little dudes not going to be a good dad
“I’ve got my tea, I hope you have as well.”  Sadly I’ve drank all mine 🙃
Daz giving parent edvice  also Daz:ahh that was right in the tit right in the tit
PLEASE YOU NEED TO VOICE AN AD
When he was like she looks like a ikea couch I was laughing so hard and the other things to he makes me laugh so much :)
The Look of death
did i just hear “kidd my willy”😭😭
When I was younger and I got in trouble I just had to count to 100 to let my mom calm down and then I was free
I feel like with super nanny this helps me as a first time single mum she’s only 2 and she listens for now 😂 but I know she probably have my attitude I had
The mum=Cris rock. The small kid=will smith
With my daughters drawings etc I keep it in a folder 😂😂 otherwise I wouldn’t see my cupboards or fridge/freezer
"Kiss Ma Willie" EXCUSE ME?!?
I love you
when you did  that Mum face i heard the intro for The Shining in my head! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
“Shortened sentence or freedom, shortened sentence or freedom”  This had me WHEEZING
Daz should react to that one episode of super nanny where the kid made a B-line to run into the street
We need more videos with him and his dog 😭😭😭😭 to cute and precious ❤️❤️
I have ADHD, Bipolar, aspergers and it can be very dangerous for me to be around kids that are misbehaving
7:50 oo some kids getting dropped kicked across the living room
those children are behaving that way because the parents,in this case mother allows them to do so. She supposed to smack him in the ass,there's no way I'd even try biting or hitting my mom,I plainly wouldn't dare. If she's just standing there doing nothing she's giving him permission to behave that way,next thing he'll be spitting into her face. No nanny's  needed,just a good old belt slap
I bit the hand of some kid at school who kept stealing my toy and he told on me and I was scared to tell the teachers and I'm still mad about it
that mother needs to spank those children
Not to be bad and all but did the mom ever introduce her kids to a asswhopin.😎😂
I got an award for the best messy bun 💀
Daz does the intro. The next two words “BIRTH CONTROL”
13:39-14:57     thank you so much for the mini pep talk!!!
My mum didn't even have to say anything she had The Look its like a fucking jedi mindtrick just instant oh i done fucked up lol ps she's not a bitch she's the loveliest person
Can you do more supper nanny
Awe cute dog
Since when did dad have a daughter
My cousin bit me one time so hard that I woke up in the ambulance because I wouldn't wake up and that f!cking child got what he deserved👼
Daz should play bitlife
The Mum look is one point😂😭
Same I was mad at my brother and bit him then my mom yelled at me and bit me so I know how it feels I just act like I'm going to bit them but I'm not going to never again
9:55 😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂🤣
My dogs called gizmo and we have so many names for him-giz,moses,mosey,gizzy
Daz just has a point
So funny

Gizmo is soooo cute
Daz be like - I'm watching super nanny never wants kids again
How old is your daughter
Anybody ever heard of "Whoop that ass!!!" ???
my mum doesnt even have to do that beacuse if my mum caught me doing that oh oh christ id have to move to the other side of the world
He said kiss my willy  🤣😂🤣
Hi I have wached this 8 times
'I've watered you'
No but your mum biting you😭 I’ve got my tea 😂
You and Sarah are just like me and my dad we look alike and are very violent
I just love how daz said he watered his dog 🐶 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Now that I look back I remember that I was almost as bad as the little boy, I was such a terrible child now that I think about it ;-;
May mumy give  me more money for being good 👍 🙏 🙂 😌 ✨
ONLY SUM CIDS
OK 👌 🆗️ 🙆‍♀️ 👍 🆒️
OK

That's not what kids do
I still think knocking the snot out of or beating a child for hitting or biting is the best solution.  If I hit or bit my parents, I would have gotten a belt to my butt.  And guess what?  I grew up not biting or hitting people.  Was I bad?  Yes, but only on rare occasions.
All of those nannies are built like female tanks.
Daz games
Is it just me who heard Reese say "kiss my willy"?
Btw you have the same dog as me
Dazs: iT IS tHe lOok 🔪🔪☠️
Daz what type of dog do u have
It’s time for adoption get me the papers 😀
Sry for everyone who doesn’t have one
My dad didn’t go for the milk
Mums are anoying but they are caring
Daz you are a very good influencer on this platform I’m glad that I am subscribed to you Always Dazzling 🌸✨
for fuck sake he reacts to these videos soo funny the way he swears
When that kid bit his mom I felt that 😂🤣
"oooooh that is getting drop kicked across the living room" i laughed way to hard at that
Did anyone else hear what he said at 11:30 in this video or is just me
"ooooo that was right in the tit" lol
Me when my neighbours are fighting wholesome content
At camp I once got an award for best sleeper because when the teacher would wake us I was last to get up 😂 I also bit both my kids when they bit me, they only ever bit once
Introducing: Ass whooping
See if I ever acted out like that, my mama would’ve just backhanded me. I’m 20 and she would still backhand me if I talked shit to her 💀
Imma be honest here I thought the title said DAZ WATCHES SUPER FUNNY for a second    I realized that it was nanny not funny after daz said super nanny In the first few minutes of the video
Once someone in my school got a certificate for eating the most lunch ( they had a normal amount of food )
Your dog is adorable!🤩😍
when i was little my mum used to sit me and my sister down and make us watch this show, we were TERRIFED of super nanny, so whenever we were bad she would threaten to call her over to our house and we behaved. we live in Australia so know i realise she couldnt of called her but
Bruh the kid did a will Smith
POOR CASEY :(
If I am being really naughty my mum will give the look and I am like uh I am sorry
Loved the last bit about getting someone pregnant. Very motivational 🙌
The mom look 😂
✨SuPeR nAnNy To ThE rEScUcE wEeEeEe ✨🦸‍♀️✈️🕺😂😂😂
I stopped the video to make tea when daz said "I got my tea and I hope you do to"
Yeah I use the mock my mum when she turns her back I stick the rude finger up at her And I likes screamed but not actually screamed like ahhhhh no It Was under my voice
And jo frost is dressed as an IKEA couch, sound about right
The dad want to get the milk
“Ohhhhhh my god some kid is going to get dropped kicked across the living room”
“Ahhhhhhhhhhh hes biting”that got me lol
THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE T*T that was a throw!
OKIE so first impression about how the youngest behaves...... Daz I am honestly at a lost for words. I'm 19 so I'm in the "You cant hit children" age but I was brought up the old fashion way. If I did any of the things that child did at time stamp 3:50 I would have been turned over and tanned. If I ever even put up my fist to look intimidating my dad would tell me "Go outside, find me a branch and bring it here." He would proceed to swat my buttocks so I chose the bigger branches. I would have to behave or they would discipline me  without any warning. Honestly I hate how strict they were but in the long run I became a well mannered gentleman who hates people who cause unneeded pain. I agree that parents should not let their children have their way around the house. Although children have their own parents and I respect how they want to  raise the child even if I disagree.
I LOVE YOUR FURBABY DAZ <3!!! lol Do they have a name?
My mom would beat me with a shoe
Daz my mum did the same thing to me i bit my sister and my mum bit me back i never did it again :)
big up daz telling the lad sto stay in their kids life's
Daz:im just that single guy with a dog a few seconds later daz:just me and my daughters mother
I watch this while making earings for a business that I haven't opened. I am under 15yrs old.
Gizmo is so cuteee!
my mother would, beat me<3
One thing my parents did to get me to stop misbehaving was say "if you don't clean your room I'm gonna leave and never come back" and when I didn't clean they would get in their car and drive down the street for like 20-40 minuets sitting there knowing when they got back it would be done
That puppy is so cute
What do you do if your baby mumma runs off with your kid
LIKE IF I WAS THE BABYSITTER I WOULD OF TROWED TEM IN THE LAKE OR OUT OF A WINDOW 🪟
Id send tem both accept kassie for adoption lol !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi dad I've never been able to comment before but I don't have a proper account on my xbox but now I can be I'm on my dads phone I love your videos btw
only daz can make a 15:00 min vid out of a 02:00 min vid
Tge but pan
Daz: wow he’s gon super satin just standing on the table like: 🙄 AHHHH
Daz: AHHHHH HES BITIN!
is it just me or does Daz look like he's crying
Dad legitimately seems like a great dad
When me and my step sister were kids, we loved each other and would do things that would get us both in trouble. Other times we hated each otherm and she would get me in trouble because her mom and my dad believed her for some reason. Anyway, we were usually in the corner as kids and ket me tell you, those corners were our best friends growig up. They werem't punishments for us, it was fun time. Though, even if we got in trouble for doing the same thing, she always got out a lot sooner than me, despite her being older than me.
A stern mum is sooo scary
Some advice.turn Mexican and USE THE SLIPER AND BE THE MEXICAN MOTHER
the amount of times i spat out my dr.pepper bc of laughing is unbelivable
Kids are the reason I dont want kids
Somebody bum me
Gizmo Gizmo Gizmo
Omg  I was put on the naughty step all the time 🤣
"like spiderman, but she was bitten by another mum"🤣
So it’s true that dogs look like their owners
Daz: *gives good parenting advice* Also Daz: BITE HIM
what breed is gizmo?
Ooh myyy goooood someones gonna get drop kicked across the room
The kid said I don't want sandwiches I want YOU😈
I mean i got a certificate for taking a big bag to the residential trip so quite literally anything
"The little one probably gets most of the attention, she's probably thinking "that's how I get my mum's attent8ion. By relocating her upper jaw." Spot on with that assessment, Daz. 13:58-14:08 This is a very good message.
The naughty spot/corner never worked for me as a child. Neither did those safety gate things to put on stairs to make sure a child can't get through, I would climb over them. Somehow I also used to manage to bring a chair to where the house keys used to be hung up and get them down then move the chair to the front door and unlock it.
Can I just say , he's  just the best
Adorable dog
She kinda sounds and looks like my primary school teacher but my teacher was with blonde hair haha
9:16 he looks like Mr Bean in a way..
Alright, Calm down.
See my mother was the same with the stern glare whenever I was cheeky and I became very well behaved but instead of the looking up and down thing, she somehow, every time, managed to make DIRECT eye contact no blinking at all. Ya boy cleaned his room.
It’s so cute that daz has a daughter tho
Bring Giz back
my family could never, if I even thought about disrespecting my parents I would get an ass whoppin'
Those children need to be used as basketballs.
YOU WATERED HIM?! Poor giz! OH I DIED😂😂😂😞
DAZ DOES THE BEST PARENTING ADVICE GOOD JOB MAN 👍
Oh my god bro Daz Is more responsible than anyone ik like just he’s amazing 🤩
Gizmo is the name of my cat i used to have but he either died,Just chilling somewhere,he ran away,or someone took him
Same dog name
Goku 2.0
Some one gonna be drop kicked across the living room HAHAHA 🤣🤣🤣
Or the dad could have got the milk
I laughed so hard when the boy standed up on the table and screamed
Ya hes the worst
The dad comes back wit the milk But right as he sees those kids Him well um i gotta get sum more brb in 10 years💀
Before I even knew that dogs name, I knew that dogs name.
THE KIDS ARE PYSCOPATHS
Mother) YOUR RUDE* child) 😭😭😭🤚* daz) LET  ME BE SUPER NANNY*
BITE THE CHILD!!! LOL?!?!?!!??!!??
I'm sorry but who in their right mind names their kid: resse or however its spelled, it just reminds of Reesee's like XD
Should be my son that kid! They need a old upbringing rules and punishments!
Kill it
Iggy
Where is the popcorn
IM DYING HELP ME 😭☠️
9:15 Uncanny
THOSE KIDS SLAPPED THE MUMMY LIKE SHE WAS CHRIS ROCK AND THEY WERE WILL SMITH
them: what should we do for the next episode one of them lets tell the kids to beat the absolute shit out of there mom
the naughty step always worked for me because i knew that if i got up and moved then it  would be the last thing i ever did
It's funny how parents handle their kids differently, like when I was a kid I used to throw tantrums when I didn't get what I want, so when I went to a shop with my mom I saw a doll I really liked. I asked my mom if I could have it and she straight up said no, so me being me I started to throw a huge tantrum, the thing is that my mom didn't react in a way she normally does, she just looked at me and walked away, I didn't see her so I thought she left me and driven home. Ever since that day I learned respect and appreciate my mother, she did end up coming back though 😅
If i was the super nanny i would drop kick every single one of the kids
Some of the things daz says during this is inspirational to me,I will remember some of these quotes when I ever go to have sex. Specifically about staying with the mother and helping her if she gets pregnant
daz has a stand user dog jojo reference                                    im black
Yo  daz
12:52 if i was that mother i would have just chucked that kid over the river handrailing after making sure no one was around😂
In the store I’m pretty sure the youngest said can you touch my Willie
Your is so cute 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I’m sorry but me and those kids would have been boxing she leave those kids with me they coming back with a black eye and a bloody nose I’m sorry but that’s how it is
And 7m subscribers subscribers
Lol
gizmo is adorable ! <3
see like, this sometimes feels like its fake, but i really don’t think it is, when you’re planning to have children you don’t even imagine this, this isn’t something that up coming parents know how to deal with nor even know that it cant get this bad, but like, it’s normal for kids to throw tantrums occasionally, so they do their best with that, but like, this is literally seems like a tantrum times ten that never ends, and like, obviously the parent(s) love their kid(s), so when this happens it kills them and probably makes them feel like they failed :(
NGL sometimes kids just need a soft slap on the head
I used to bite my brother when I was like 3 or 4 and my mom bit me too, and it damn worked.
9:29 Two weeks? I’d get 2 years if I got caught doing that 😀
Especially these ones! Btw do you have anymore pets then the dog?
I rlly like your vids😊😊
If my kids ever do anything like that to their mom, they're gonna have a rude awakening
bless her  and when you said HAND CUFF HIM ! i almost peed lol 🤣😅😂😂😂🤣😂🙂
Oh as soon as I give the “mum look” to my 8 year old & even my 3 year old they know they’ve done wrong & I don’t even need to say anything 😂. The naughty corner worked great for my daughter when she was little. Best technique I used
Love Supernanny! Used her techniques on my kids & they work.
i was watching this on my computer with no headset on then my mom walks in and dad goes "someones about dropkicked to the living room" and i was laughing my ass off meanwhile my mom is telling me to look at my browser history.
I used to have a dog almost exactly to your but brown and white and his name was gizmo but he recently passed away
i know its child abuse but like i would literally slap my child so hard if he/ she hit me.... idk if that's just me or-
7:44
When I looked at the thumbnail on the video was like naughty naughty
Hereeeeeee
giz is the new daz
My mom did the same thing I bit my mom as a child n she bit me right back n I apparently just looked bewildered like tf just happened
puppyyyyyyy
Put the price lower on your Merch so I can buy it make your own photo by it please I'm begging

Send the 4 year old to a mental hospital and give him a therapist.
I would have got put though a wall got told to rebuild the wall then put though it again
Child:you little fucker bastard Daz:someone's gonna get drop kicked across the living room.😂😂
Super nanny has the worst advice. Honestly she doesn't even have kids herself
Well done dad good advice
my guy the nanny looks like mary poppins
Omg some kids gonna get dropkicked across the living room
All of them have dippers on and the oldest is 8
He needs a good ole beat’n
Daz: “They’re wearing blue she’s wearing blue” Me: “IM WEARING BLUE!!”
but i cant get a man pregnet so im good
That biting thing happened to me lol 😂
MOTHER ABUSE
i used to go on the ‘naughty spot’ a lot and unluckily enough for me my parents got 2 baby gates (one for the top of the stairs and one for the bottom) i was so young i couldn’t figure out how to turn a handle to unlock them-  i also remember doing what daz did when he was swearing at his mum behind her back and i used to whisper swears behind my mum’s back and i never got caught 😂
Your dog looks so funny and cute
i would have probably locked them in the basement with the lights off. No, no I´m not okay
😂😂😂
1448 yes absolutely nothing I would complain about that
What kind of dog is that pls tell
I DIDNT HAVE TEA but ... i have gravy so we r ok now :> -sips gravy - ima keep watching daz have a nice day

HÉ REALLY SAID “kiss my willy”
I would be the BEST! Kid if I was just treated like an adult I’m sure people can agree
at 8:19 that string of spit triggers me
“And Jo is dressed like an ikea couch” 😭😭
Daz:*calmly watches this woman with a cup of tea and her arguing with her own kids  Also daz:OH NO HANDCUFF HIM
BLU DEE JEE SUS
If I hit my mum like that I wouldn't see another Day 🤣🤣🤣

AHHHHH ES BITEN!!!!!!
My dog has the same name difference is he is a 130 German shepherd
Every word daz says should be heard around the world 😂
Dog
Daz doesn't see it, if he just hugged his dog for 10 minutes on video everyday he subscriber count would be in the billions
Daz: she gots them all lined up like little Natzis
the nanny reminds me of nanny McPhee
Her kids are going to boxers when they’re older
DAZ I LOVE LOVE LOVE YOU, you have the best content and it always makes me laugh when I'm sad. Thank you.   From: A Fan 😇
Just say to the kid you gay him:.........
Giz nice name
If that. Kid cries one more time i will just throw it out the window savages quotes
this is why i wont have kids cause if i was that mom i wouldve beat them and put them in the oven like i hate kids
Nigga
I had a dog like that named gizzy
Mum:”no”   Kid:” *TRAIN*
crikey that happened
This is why I hate children lmao
Agreed they all look like the Australian Ikea couches согласен, все они похожи на австралийские диваны из икеи
I got an award for always smiling once lmfaoo
is your dog cross eyed?
🔥
Honestly I think its the parents that made them so mean because the kids see there parents do uncool stuff,hitting, yelling, etc. so they think that stuff is good to do.
i get hit
Certificate for shiniest shoes believe it or not one of my relatives got the same award for the shiniest shoes. It was only cause they were new
I don’t want kids because my major depression can lead them to have it and also have a crappy childhood   And my family are toxic and it’s caused me to not even want to leave my bed
add a comment...
Dude if I tried to pull any of this as a kid I’d get whipped so hard i go blind
Little Nazis😂😂😂
If I were that mom those kids would be dead by now 😂
Daz  is so funny most  funniest  youtuber  i have watched 😂😂😂
Bruh you not lonely where you're child and wife
fear.
My brother hit my sister and my dad pinned him to the wall and let my sister hit him on the arm and told him never to hit women!
I love your videos I've been w watching since 2014
how does a 4 year old know cus words
More Gizmo
has she ever heard of putting your children in a orphan...
These kids need asian parents 😂
You give them an inch and they take a mile is what my science teacher said
Giz was not having it
She needs a holiday off
AHHHhhHhhHhHhh HE’S BITING
"OMG some kids gonna get dropped kicked across the living room"  That was just golden
OoOo My GoD sOmE kId Is GoInG tO gEt DrOp KiCkEd AcRoSs ThE lIvInG rOoM🤣
BlOoDy JeSuS 🤣🤣
the wisest words by Daz
Amen Daz!!!!!!!!! Preach
Something I just wonder what the dog thinking
In words of the youngest said in the shop to his mum kiss my Willy
My mom just hit me with a sandal if a did something wrong it worked
CAN U STOP PAUSING EVEREY FKING SECOND JESUS CRHIST U LITERALLY PAUSE TO SAY THAT THEYRE WEARING BLUE CLOTHES LIKE STFU BRO
“BLUH DEE JHEE ZUS”
“She looks like a curtain”
7:45 your welcome
I use to have a dog named gizmo
The boy "NOTHING" Daz "then that's what you'd get! YOUD ALSO GET MY BOOT"  Me"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I would unadopt those kids
u watered him-?
If me and my sister were arguing my mom would get one of my dads t-shirts and put both of us inside. It worked, to say the least.
Daz: BIRTH CONTROL Me: checked what I pressed on
Is it bad, that when I was younger, still in grade school, I would watch this show with my mom....for fun? Every week, we'd watch the new episode.
Give gizmo some coffee chewing gum
6:35 BLOOD-Y JESUS
I feel sorry for Casey.
I do not condone hitting children but it would be hard not to if one bit me.
Cute frenchie
I don’t get why he pauses it because it’s 2 minutes and it’s 15 minutes not trying to be rude but WHY
What's the name of the episode
The face daz made when describing his mother's "silent" look is so damn accurate
It could be worse u could be a lonely single woman with 50 cats
When I was little my mum would send us to our room instead of a naughty corner and I would just keep asking if I could come out but there was nothing stopping me from just walking out
I got a certificate for being the clumsiest person in the whole year group 😂😂
When the kids from this show get older they need to be shown the video of them to see how they were
I have an idea maybe not the best but probably will help she could leave the house for a while leave the kids in there and then come back and maybe when you were gone the kids realized that she/you is important and for them to respect
The kids are so Slappy and the little sweared can’t believe it
GIZ CANT FUCKING LOOK STRAIGHT 😂 HE BE LIKE 👁👅👁
Gizmo :D
The dad went to get the milk
wanna know whats funny he has a 2 min video and then turns his video into 15 mins like wtf but hes raelly funny me and my sister always used to watch him but she grew up and now i never watch anything with her and i acctually dying but she dont know  if im alive in 2 days ill reply to my comment
"Kiz my willy"
As they get older take away their charging leads and watch their faces as the power drains from their devices, they cant apologise enough...
My Mum used the look on me and in turn I used it on mine, only had an issue with one got told he was Autistic, took a different approach with him and now he works 40 hours a week. Still got to be careful and its hardwork still (he is 20) but he gets there xxx
If they were my kids I would slap them and don’t even give them any food for the rest of the day
How do you water a dog
Daz your dog is soooo cute! 😍😍😍
7:24 no the kids killed him
I absolutely need every second of my day to be filled with that dog. I mean I’m over exaggerating obviously but the dog is so adorable.
I would be a horable parent because they would be beaten so hard they would be unconscious
Wanna know the secret my parents did to have great kids? .... Childhood trauma
I thought the mom slap the kid i was no she cant that noo
He is a goat
Bet gizmo shit himself when daz said “I’m going to put you down now” 😂
"Oh someone about to be drop kicked across the room" it's so funny  😂 🤣
Daz you are so funny
And supper nanny doesn't have her own children i wonder why lol 😆
Your dog is lovely x
They’re all wearing blues the Smurf family
If I even said nothing for a sandwich my mum would have given me a back of a hand to the ear. 😂🤣😂🤣😂
Naaa the best way to get ride of kids is shotgun
I’m laughing so hard😂
Vanilla ice
Bro I want a little me’s and I’m only 13 and I wanna bunch of little me’s I’ll be hanging out with them all time
Just started the video and had to stop to say how much i love gizmo!! We need to see him more!!
If she spanked her kids this wouldn’t be a problem 😂
I threw my sister out of my room, literally... she hit the other wall quite hard..  I fought my little brother frequently, I still has a bald spot that might've been a result of those fights.. I tried to set my pre-school school on fire... I stole from the local supermarket..  All in all, I was a pretty well-behaved kid...
They could still be twins. One born 23.59 on new years eve and the other one 00:02.....
no wonder that kid has a temper she freaking slaped him
ADVICE:smack them until they learn not too do that AGAIN
I’m 12 and I know this from experience you smack them upside their head that will straighten then up for a while
Daughter!?
My school gave me a certificate for playing hopscotch
*wholesome content*
Mate when my mum gave me a look I would hand her the belt
Ok but like in Europe your mom would just beat the shit out of you
Gis is cute
watch educating manchester or educating the east end
I love gizmo and daz they are the perfect  duo
Where the father in this relationship?
My mom bit me 😂  happened to couple of my cousins growing up too
I never bit anyone growing up I've probably given attitude and that's it but I'm sorry I'm giving my child a spank or a a small slap in the face for biting  cause damn I ain't gonna raise a cannibal
Omg the kid in the kitchen taking the 👛
Daz:pull my hair back and put me in blue LOL.
Bro if I'm bad I would get chased with a rolling pin by my dad and I would get slapped o have Asian parents😭
ngl the first 33 seconds of the vid where the best
I know he's doing this serious talk about how they should take responsibility for the baby they make and that but my head instantly went to "well...there is a way to make sure there's no chance of a baby...such as being gay"
I have a dod named gizmo
bro i think there bad my little sister smashed glass
When u start crying in front of them they will feel bad
Would've turned into a akin skywalker
That little kid said “suck my willy” 😂😂😂 at 11:47

J͜͡u͜͡s͜͡t͜͡ l͜͡o͜͡l͜͡
Next time when daz watches super nanny again,he should wear blue and a wig ✨✨✨
Currently drinking tea because time FoR a TeA pArTy
i got a certificate for being a good chaterbox
Don't have kids if you can't handle them. I swear the amount of idiots who have kids is unbelievable, and a lot of times it's unfair to the kids in situations where say the kids are neglected (not here specifically but happens a lot). Stupid people everywhere who don't care and just go through life like a checklist without questioning "damn, is this for me?".
I started drinking water during the intro and when he said “BIRTH CONTROL!!!“ I almost choked
9:29
He should be “super nanny” but not helping kids, having a tea party with them to tell the mum “BITE THEM 👹”
Kid: SHUT IP AND FUCK OFF Daz: a kids gunna get kicked across the livin room
That's a coincidence  my dog is also called gizmo lol and when daz said "they're all lined up like little nazis" I died 🤣
It’s normal for kids u
Hahahaha
Cute dog!! (PS: My dog’s name is also Gizmo) Good vid🤓🤓
I’m so fucking glad i wasn’t like that at any moment of my childhood😳😅 and yes, i’m 16 now, turning 17 on November😅 if i ever cried in a store, my mom left me there crying. That’s all i know atm😳😅😂
Dad is cool and has cool dog to 😊😊😊😊😊
I love how I could easily destroy that nanny 😂🤣😂, broad shoulders= scary, jokes on her mine are real 😎
wait is that dog a... JOJO REFERENCE
The solid black walls in that room must make that already small space feel tiny
joe: hi my name is joe me:......... more like joe mama
And if I bit my mom I wouldn’t have no teeth if I did
"bloo-dy je-sus!"
Pro tip: there is a certain look/silent command that will always get them to behave  1.give them a cold hard stare 2.hold stare  3.frown slightly whilst staring 4.hold until they back down  I was my neighbourhood babysitter and there was one child who had deterred 3 babysitters already and I asked about their methods and all of them shouted so when he was naughty I would glare at him and oh my gosh I have never seen a more concerned child in my life 😂
What episode is this
That dog is so adorable
See that’s where you smack them
The dog is adorable
The super saiyan thing got me
Not gonna lie if I’m walking in the side walk and my kids hitting me like that I would push him into a car …. This is why I am not a mother wise words from 15 year old me
I would put them up onto Craigslist
9:15 I'm terrified
The little one is a devil 😈
His eyes are making my ass dye 😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
7:52 + 8:15 - 9:34 daz's backstory
GIZMO! 🥰🥰🥰🥰
"You're a road!"= the easiest way to make a child shut up
gg this man got 15 mins out of a 2 min vid
If you have Asian parents having slight frown will beat you up, take it from a person who has Asian parents.
Bro the fact that Gizmo (correct me if i spelled that incorrectly) actually looked MISERABLE.
i like how daz said I've watered you instead of gave you water
If i did that to my mom i will not be writing this coment i will be 6ft under grownd 😑
Not to be rude or anything is not "longer sentence or freedom!." 😬🤐
"She has em all lined up... like little nazis" lol I cant
Boy: shut up and fvck off! Daz: oh god someone is going to get dropkicked across the living room
Good words daz
THAT 4 YEAR OLD IS -JUST- LIKE MY 3 YEAR OLD BROTHER!!! HR SWEARS AND HITS!!
Yes a child can always happen with s3x...  Unless you're gay🌌🥳🏳️‍🌈🥳🌌
"some children are impossible." -Ceasar malon theme song starts*😆 gotta watch that episode of south park
If this was me my mom would hit me with a belt
Heard of a belt?
He really thinks sex is an option
super nanny is essentially a massive commercial for condoms
Daz She's got them all lined up. Like little nazis.
like little nazis
"ThAt WaS a ThUmP" 🤣😭
This should be a commercial for Trojan
Naught spot= time out....Me remembering i was put in the corner for 2 hours and 30 mins. Bro if i was this bad i would get beat
bite him 😭
Smack them 😌😌
I see they all need a wooden spoon with there name on it for Christmas
I heard that kids are spiteful because they are testing the boundaries to see what they can and can’t do
“Idiot!”  And that’s why I love how British people talk.
What tea do you drink I need some suggestions daz ☕️ they don’t have a tea emoji
Yeah,  that's a 4 kid circus!
Yes, nothing better at stopping this behavior than a boss mom lolol  My kids and I will mess around but when I'm serious I don't talk. I give them that one look and they do the "ugghhh (eye roll) fine!" Lol
🤨
B.E.L.T     Bad.Entity.Life.Teachings
"Before you say it yes I am that single man with a dog" -Daz
My mum would smack me so hard I would forget how to live for a week
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"The naughty spot" worked for me. My mom only put me there once, I was two and I did something I don't remember what but I was soo pissed that I sat there for fifteen minutes. My mom desperately tried to get me to come out she even went as far as bribing me with M&Ms even that didn't work. So you know I eventually got over myself but yeah she never put me in the "Naughty spot" again
I got the same punishment for biting its not fun but it works🤣
I remember one time I made fun of my dad once and I didn’t even do anything bad but for some reason I felt so bad that I just went straight to the naughty step but that was when I was like 4
Here in South Africa the belt comes off 😂
Hi Daz i love you man, you create the best content and make me wheeze sometimes! Keep up the great work!
cool vid😁
2:15
Super Nanny.... she trains the parents.... Its like getting a plumber to unblock the toilet...  and instead they teach you how to do it yourself.  so they never have to deal with your shit again
Daz the LONELY SINGLE MAN WITH A DOG
Bitch that freaking nanny looks like miss chargeable from Matilda
That situation a belt is needed
The 🐕
I would go to jail after the bite 😂 i wouod start BEATING the absolute jesus out of all of them.
I'm gonna be the type of mother to tell my kids "you hit me I'll hit you back 10x harder" 😐
The adoption center you go!
Smack them💀
The kids in the thumbnail looks like Chucky the killer doll
You can’t touch my dogs or your getting drop kicked through the window
i have 2 parents but my dad has nuthing to do with me or my brother
Send the bloody kids to their room and lock them in there
I have a strict Mexican Gemini mom and when i tell you she's scary she's scary
Like who mom dose not give the look of death 😂😂
The 4 year old is cute but, If he was my son, I would lock him in a room with nomu🙃
That kid would get a 100 hand slap like E Honda
Yo dazlers
YOUR DOG IS SOOOOOOOOOO CUTE DAZ
My mom would have beat my ass in like 2.2 seconds at most
I never raised a hand to my kids, but in her case, at what point does she go full Holly Holm and just waylay her kids?
When your mum gives you the silent angry face: where is the Bible and steak in this house
Makes me angry that the mum doesn’t hit the kids! As a 14 year old if I was the Big bro I would hit them to stop and never do it again or otherwise they’ll get worse consequences!!
That dog is wholesome
The stairs didn’t work for me. When my parents back was turned I would just run up and down the stairs
My family told me to shut up because I was pissing myself laughing 😂😂😂
me when i water my dog
Sucky sucky hucky  hucky long time long time
0:11 WHO IS HE LOOKING AT
my mum yost did theat to me
Daz: this is why I can’t have this job Also Daz: *has a kid*
My sister laughed so much she peed her self
Oh god if I just hit my mum or sweared once I would be beaten to death with a slipper but it worked and I never did it again
I have a dog
i love that you called your dog gizmo lol
the boy is four years old have to understand you get terrible 2 and fu fours thats what you call such behaviour
America has the same housing problem
Like little nazis
Lol
my mum would slap me across the room or i'll probably be in the hospital
A DARK CUPBOARD FIVE MINUTES -- NEXT TIME TEN MINUTES --- IF IT GETS TO 4 DAYS HAVE HIM KIDNAPPED.
SORRY --- A SMACK ON THE BUM WAS ALWAYS THE BEST REMEDY.
THOSE KIDS ARE BURIED OUT BACK --- DAZ.
What is super nanny it sounds dumb
My friends dog is called gizmo 🐶
"Me...her mother..and even the dogs-"  Im sorry the dog part just caught me off guard😅
I love daz he so wonderful
The bit where the kid says shut up and F off I have seen it all over TikTok
belt
Daz: Gives good advice for parenting Also daz: HANDCUFF HIM!!
what happend to youtubes comment ?
Dude every time I watch a daz video he tells someone to hurt a kid I swear🤣
“Omg, some kid is going to get drop kicked across the living room” Lmao I started crying laughter
Now that you told us you were single...
I’m pissing myself laughing bro I’m so glad I found this channel 😂😂  Wise words: “bite him” 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
His puppy is so cute 😄
11.38 the kid says touch my Willy
I honestly believe the punishment is the problem she needs to more tough
Actually statistically Physics A-Level is the most effective contraception
Daz makes my day if ive been bullied at school u come home and i watch him while crying and i try to cry again but i cant bc he makes me laugh too much 😂
Once I mocked my mum and she just went ok no play station for a month and you are dead mother f
Bruh when I was 4 I didn’t know what swearing was I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW WHAT LYING WAS
Right away daz swears with is 0.0 seconds wow but daz is going to be the bite of 87 or dire of 69
I think it's amazing how we have managed to find one genuine nice person who doesn't think that running off and leaving the mother with the child is the best thing to do
I'll keep my pants on to avoid getting kids from someone, I'd rather be a pet owner then a parent. 👌👌👌✔️✔️✔️
no offence but your dogs eyes scare the shit out of me
we don't need super nany any more because we have insperational quotes from dhar mann
My sisters are like this
My name is Shannon 😧
Joe is dressed like a ikea couch me “she looks that way to”
You have no idea how I was screaming so hard while watching this saying “BRO JUST HIT THEM!! HIT THEM!!” Like where’s the belt at bro? The SLIPPER?!?!!! 😭
Best thumbnail
It’s iggy
Slap SLAP SLAP 🤬🤬🤬
willy?
I'm the youngest of 5 kids and if we acted like this we would get our asses BEAT!
"Yes i am the sad single guy with a dog" LOL
0:19 daz being your best friend ever
Gizmo I can see it In your eyes  Gizmos eyes 👁👈     👁👉
im sorry what tf did he say 11:27
OMG that kids gunu get drop kick across the livin room
I can't breath help I'm dying
Come on Daz! You don't really believe that women have kids to get a council house? That's a media-createx myth, promoted by so-called reality TV such as benefit Britain etc. No one has a kid for a council flat, It wouldn't even help these days as the local council put them in homeless units or mother and baby units. Can u imagine doing it for a flat and being put in a unit! Wow raging 😜😜
Time to introduce: 🤗BEATING🤗
In my pre school at the office area you could pick up a black certificate and fill it in for anything 😂
Good mr
Daz: “give that kid his dues! PUT HIM IN AN MMA RING” lmaooo had me dead ngl 😂😭
11 28 kiss my willie
Daz “ MY GOD ITS LITTLE SATAN “
He is adorable
14:23 😑🤚 I promise Mr Daz
I think that is a jojo reference is that iggy I LOVED IGGY!!!
I feel bad for the mum
you see if I were that mom about 2 minutes into my children kicking me and slapping me there would be 3 traumatized children and a no longer pissed of me
The little one said kiss my Willy 🤣🤣
Is that some screw driver or is that some sort of killing tool
Ahhhhhhh he’s biting 🤣🤣
https://youtube.com/channel/UC_J38aSay4F2H3vwmzvCfVg
My mom did the same that that Dazs mom did and bite me back if I bite her or someone else. Although I didn't learn fast so it happend a couple of times before I stopped. I just would have never guessed me and Daz had something in common. You know Daz is a famous YouTuber and I'm just a normal person that only friend and family know of.
MY MUM DRANK ALL MY TEA!!!!!!!!!!!
THAT KID IS ABOUT GET DROPKICKED
I THINK THE DAD LEFT TO GET THE MILK🤣🤣😂
Omg it is a puppy
I can’t be the only one watching this in school right
i guess they don’t know what washing your mouth at with soap for cussing
Love the vid
Watch the Norris nuts pls pls
the death stare
Love little Gizmo.
Child abuse? Or adult?
The dad,s probably already been finished off , That’s why he’s nowhere in sight.
I love gizmo he so cute
✨goth dab and a moth grab✨
Daz what if I don't like tea ? Then what?
When he did the mom face that was 100% accurate 😂
Omg lol I laughed so hard when he told the story ab when he flipped his mom off I just spit my water out hhahaha
When I was a kid, I’m the youngest out of 4, I was chill I didn’t cry much I didn’t want attention, watching this stuff makes me wonder if anyone was chill like me when they were a kid
Like little Nazis
if i hit my mum i would either be dead or my body wouldn't be found if i swore at her i would have my bum smacked or my era flicked if i slammed the door my mum would come into my room and shout in my face. These kids get away with too much shit now
11:27 ← Did he just say "Kiss my willy?"
:)
Hi Daz I love your videos 😁😁 I hope you ok
Hi Daz I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS 😁😁 I’m a big fan I hope your ok
child hits mother   Daz: AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH , get him in the ring
I like ur dog man
Such a cute doggo, I seriously start the video over just to see the puppo.
Did he say "I've watered you," to his dog like it was a plant??😂 Edit: 11:30 He fucking said "Kiss my willy!" the kid is four!
Like little nazis 🤣😂
13:33 she looks like Ryan Reynolds
I bit my mum at 5 yrs. She did what Dazs mum did... she bit me back. He's right. It works.
“Put my hair back and put me in blue”-Daz Black
This is what the click says “A parenting license would be good in theory”
Pro tip:don’t eat or drink with while watching
'little nazis' 👏👏👏
You should be a supernanny
My cat is called gizmo and is white and black- ✨😩
D O G.
I think the best thing to do would be to hire a stranger to yell at the kids. Nothing will make a kid shut up more than someone they don’t know yelling at them
WOCHE REBECCA ZOMOLO
𝙁𝙪𝙣𝙣𝙮
As a dad of a 14 yr old. Thank you sir, you do a fantastic job and have great advice, I'm glad my boy watches someone like you.
She needs to get a belt and whip em wit it
How does Daz make a 2 minute video into a full on 15 minute video
this had me dying XD 11:28
theres a intricate tool when in these situations when your child hit you and curses at you and its called THE BACK OF YOUR HAND
2:02 😭
The same thing happen to me I bit my brother so my mum bit me, I never bit anyone after that 😂
9:15 its so true though, it's just the look, lol
"That's how I get mom's attention I relocate her jaw"
Thats the exact fucking face!🤣
me going down stairs to make a cup of tea before watching daz games
Jeez, Gizmo can look both ways whilst crossing the road at the same time ! 😂
I stabbed my brother with a fork in the shoulder when I was a kid
“She has them all lined up like lil nazis” stop I can’t😭😭😭😭😭
Daz: *bite him*
amazing words of wisdom, my mom did that to me too
Here’s how you fix that four year old, you don’t let them hit, bite, or whatever, you give them a swat, put them in their room, and not allow any toys, tv, games, etc. You can’t talk to anyone kids behaving violently like that. He’d never leave the house except for school.  My kids knew that kind of behavior wasn’t going to fly.
I was awful for biting when I was younger. Until my mother bit me in the same places I’d bite other kids an I stopped quickly
I feel so bad for when she gets punched in the tits bless her *it got me crying 🤣😂
It hits diffrent when he says he satnd on table and go aRGhA ayya
Your videos are amazing and funny
Reece isn’t happy with the menu  My mum used to say well if you don’t want to eat that then you aren’t eating anything.  I am not a fussy eater now and have never been
IM 12 AND HE SAID I COULD GET SOME GIRL PREGNET
Daz really just said he watered his dog 😂😂😂💀💀💀
I remember one time my dad put me on the naughty step and I was sat there for hours and ended up falling asleep because my dad forgot about me😂😂😂
a certificate for the shiniest shoes 😭
I mean dogs cute
I did the same thing when I was a kid and I never bit anyone again
Any of these children being mine bro….. Jesus I would have slapped them bc of the swearing and give them one chance to stop before I sparked them
This was me raising my siblings...I'm 16
My mom would smack me across the room if I swore
Uhmmmmmmmmm my teachers are obsessed with watching super nanny… they always ridicule the show because in class we’re angels but at home 3/4ths of our class including my friends are like a Tasmanian devil on crack
Chuck missi and hasbullah in the ring who do yous think would win? 🤣
Dad is the king of laughter
There’s is nothing there that a belt won’t fix
You see my parents got a double baby gate for the step so it was like actual prison
My mum looked  me up and down  when i am in trouble  and i ran a cross the street  to my friends house  i was that scared  i stayed  there for 2 weeks
Iggy
And Jo Frost is dressed like an ikea couch 😂😂😭😭
😪😪😪💢💢💢
Imagine this kid watches this video one day and comes to the comments 😂😂
They should just get hand cuffs as a punishment they can’t really hit you
1:19 i nearly peed laughing
Gizmo is cute he even though he looks depressed
Well now ya dog can’t f*ck** here because you yell at the top of your voice “what is up dazzlers welcome BACK TO A DAZ GAMES AND ANOTHER DAZ WATCHES” (I’m actually a big fan but still)
Kids going super Satan
Why is he so funny 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🥲🤣🥲🤣🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🥲😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
The fear of what happens if I don’t stay on the spot, kept me on the spot
Daz is amazing
Day handcuff him
I like your cat jizmo
I went on the naughty step once and i never did agen, still to this day I am scared of my mum, u don't want to see her when she's angry, I told my friends how scary she was and so thy tested her patients so she was like oh its OK we all make mistakes .e.c.t. and after my mum said I don't EVER want to see you with them egen. Mum's are scary.
Jest for the dog
The nanny looks likes my year 3 teacher
wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
7:45😂
Those kids need to be punished by country people and then they will have amazing manners and always listen and be polite.
Daz: She's a full time mum and punching bag!!! Me: Im a full time sister and punching bag...
right🤣🤣🤣🤣
Idk why but I think it’s funny how it took 12 minutes for 1 minute of the video
All I can say is super nanny... Doesn't work
Dad:I’m water you
I remember having to be on the naughty step, My parents had to buy a baby gate to keep me on it and lock me on the steps both ways.I once climbed over it and broke my arm because of where is fell, worst decision of my life.
Daz is the dream best friend
New drinking game, drink every time something happens from super nanny that your mom would have knocked you into next week or relocated your face to the back of your head for doing. Honestly, I’d be dead from the drinks🤣🤣🤣
I got a certificate for watching anime-
It's really sweet how he doesn't blame the mother like a lot of people do pretty much immediately. She is a good mum and shes doing her best.
This show just proved even more why im not capable of being a mother. The way i would've slapped them would be ungodly
I have got my tea I'm drinking it 🤩
LMAO you are soooo right
yesssss the mom thing i did that same thing
lmao omg
Shit I was worse
DUDE WHEN THE 4 YR OLD BIT HIS MOM THE FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MIND WAS " SOMEBODY PUT A MUSSLE ON HIMM!!!"
The dad is being milk
I got a certificate for going to school lol
"With her mum senses like spider-man, shes like been bitten by another mum" I now live by this quote from daz...😂
My friend has four parents cuz his parents divorced that’s why
honesty i would grab it swing it into the wall and stand on its head
Gotta love daz
your dog is soo cute! you sould put him more in your vids :)
Put some soap in his mouth that’s what my mum did
Who else would get absolutely flattened by there mum just for doing half of this?
10/10 that would be the day i would go to jail
:)))
I just realized that me and daz have the same named dog. I have a dog and her name is gizmo.
Little Stupid:  pushes little brother  Mom is turned away Also little stupid: Hits little brother-little brother starts crying Mom turns around doesn't say anything just looks at me. Little stupid: sorry..
I got a certificate for getting a pen license
There is only one thing to do if your kid is being a brat, punching you, and disrespecting Adoption or  Give them Anger management class
Ooooh my sername is frost
No children have got the better of her all I could think of was South park 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Your the funniest person alive😂😂
Bro his dog looks like Iggy and I love it
All my God
“My god some kids gonna get drop kicked across the living room” -Daz 2021
Daz: *Shows dog on camera once* His following: *Goes up by like a million* Dog: 😈😈😈😈
Bruh I don’t even wanna know what happens if you let those kids loose with Amish people
7:45 ppl hmmmmmm good tik tok yesss
If I was like this I would get killed
Daz has a best community

The calmest intro ever
Gizmo is my dogs name😰
Mans playing darts at his mum 😂😂
i went to foster care and now i live with my mom  and i see my dad every week end
Daz your funny when u laugh
The naughty step was very effective for me as a small child, my Nan would stand there for the first few times but then soon I would be on my own and be too scared to leave. 10/10 technique works
The death stare is TERRIFYING from mom and when your dad raises his voice, stern face, dead stare into your soul. You're in deep trouble
*clicks video and looks away*             * looks back* OMG ITS A PUPPY DOG
don’t think she love him anymore
fuck auto correct
shut up Reesie’s PCs
Reesie’s PCs get down
Scariest thing a mom can do is whisper scold
i miss the old closet backround.
Dad you should react to the Norris nuts songs!!
My mom would’ve took her big ass paddle and taking it to my butt and I would’ve been in my room for weeks
If i was a kid and Daz walked up to my house i would fix my attitude real quick
I love it so much when Daz randomly tells a story. It's always so funny. 😂
They could be twins. In third and forth grade I had twins in my class and one of them was two years older. They weren't identical but they were still twins
That was my hamsters name gizmo but he passed away sadly 😔😔
All Mums after scolding their child: Turns Around* Daz Standing there like:🧍🏼‍♂️🖕🏻, Mum: looks you up and down*. THATS THE SIGN THAT YOUR GROUNDED!!…
It’s like a gang beasts match
My mom passed away in 2015 and it still hurts like hell but I hold on to memories. I remember when me and my brother would fight when we were kids and all mom had to do is give us that look, not saying a word, and we stop immediately I love you mom
what was the purpose of the nanny she didnt litterly do anything lol
Kids going super saian
Aaaa he'sbiting
😂😂😂😂😂😂
😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That dog looks like he's just dissociating😂
I'm with you 😂😂😂😂😂 when your mom looks at you you regret your life
It's official...I'm never having kids
Watch its me or the dog but make sure its the full episodes
Its funny i was like when he said get some tea i was like sorry daz
13:40 Damn, hats off.
The always say that the dog looks like the owner and the owner like the dog gues ther right what a love omggg
My jaw hurts so bad from laughing lmao
I'd slap them into another century. I really do feel bad for the mum as well, can't imagine the thought of being scared of your own kids.
why did you cute little dog almost kill me of luaghter. you amost went crosseyed. Lol
He's the only youtuber that pauses the video and makes me not annoyed
I used ur sound for my tiktok account when you said OH MY GOD SOME KIDS GONNA GET DROP KICKED ACROSS THE LIVING ROOM HAHAHAHAH THEN I MADE THE MUM DROP KICK THE CHILD ACROSE THE LIVING ROOM HAHAHA
when i got put on the naughty step i’d sob uncontrollably and scream untill my ears hurt and apparently i threw myself at the closed door that my mum had to sit on the other side to stop me from opening it. i also used to scare people when i was like 1-5 or even longer because i used to bite people. no one could tell weather i wanted to love them or bite them lmao
me and my brother are in tears from laughing keep,it up daz you are fabulous!!
One time my litttle cousin was biting everyone and cussing and hitting people and I yelled “SHUt Up JAMES THIs IS WHY uR ADOPTED” so loud it scared him
t- that’s my school uniform
IGGY
Just pimp slap him
‘ANOTHER DAZ WATCHES’
Shes giving off very much Principal from matilda vibes
She might need an exsorcist
What type of dog is gizmo
Hahahaha
The dad went to get milk
My Nana is the same as Daz’s mum.  She’s Serbian, so she knows the scare tactics.  One time I was having a bad day, and I spoke back to my Nana. I spaced out and my Nana went “Earth to *name*!” In a funny way. I replied with  “Oh I know perfectly well the earth is there” spitefully.  My Nana gave me A LOOK. I said sorry and then made her a cup of coffee.   Me and my cousins could be little shits and our parents could be at their wits end, but we would always listen to Nana.  She wouldn’t have to do anything, she would have to say anything. She would just give you the look and you would walk yourself to the naughty step or whatever punishment thing you had in place at the time.  My Nana’s amazing, always has been.
hahahhahahahahhhahahahahhahaha daz u make my day
5:11 I’d just give him bread
5:05 to 5:07 he sounds like Mike wazoski
King giz
THOSE KIDS TURNED INTO F*****K IKE FROM SOUTHPARK!
Daz and his dog 🥰❤️
I had to put my fist in my mouth to stop laughing. Its 2 am and im watching Daz
Rko daddada
You should watch the full episode. Some of them are hilarious! And some the parents are just plebs. I remember when one family had a 15 year old boy and he was basically looking after 4 other kids all day as the parents worked. Poor boy ended up having a panic and anxiety attack. I was heartbroken
Who else stopped listening when daz gave his speech about pregnancy because yk u will never find someone who loves u? 😭
Wait how old is he
They throwing some mean right hooks
Good luck straight bois
I would just hit the child like my mom did like hard once me and my sister got pulled out of church by our grandma and got brought home we thought yayyy then she hit us not like abuse but like whipped us and picked a switch
just give ur kids a little smack on the face
7:44
Daz and his dog❤️❤️❤️
I like the insult of "kiss mah willy"
I like you, you get to the video content quickly. Within one to two mins.I hate those channels that say things like ‘watch is skate down a half pipe. Then it takes them 30 mins of filler to actually do it, and it’s shit
Hey daz! Mind mailing the dog to me? Thanks 🥺❤
pooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Daz is so creative that he from 2 minute video makes a video of 15 minutes
Ooh someones gonna get dropped kicked across the living room
What happens to your daughter
Jesus loves you
I know how to fix the little boy, it’s called a head lock drop kick three sixty kick combo
“Bloo-dy JESUS!”
“Oh my God these kids are SATAN!”-DazGames
“They’re all lined up, like little Nazis.”-DazGames
i'd tie them to a chair and put headphones on em making them listen to something extremely boring or loud
I don't get why she doesn't just throw the kids across the room, that outta teach em a lesson. Now I don't condone child abuse....but...i wouldn't blame her if she gave them each a smack or two.
7:49 Daz’s unexpected sentence had me laughing out loud
I would have had the snot beaten out of me if I dared do anything these brats do to their mom. First thing I would have gotten if I tried hitting my mother would have been a slap in the face lol Edit: Mind you, that would only be the FIRST thing...
I water you me HE A PLANT
How do the kids not see the camera???
"No!" FUCK 🤣
I HAVE WATERED THE DOG AND HE IS NOW GROWING
My mom smiles at me and laughs
IKEA bulk at Costco
Me : “looks away for a few seconds” The first thing I hear is and Joe Frost Is dressed like an ikea couch
HIS DOG IS CALLED GIZMO THATS WHAT I NAMED MINE
The fact that the dog is called gizmo is just 💅🏻✨👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Honestly the message that he just sent to all men out there that if you get a girl pregnant you need to step up and take responsibility and be there for the girl and the child made me gain so much respect for this man like I thought he was a great person to begin with but that’s just such an amazing message to put out there
ur single? don’t u have a daughter x
Where he's talking about the naughty spot, all that came to mind was that one episode of South Park. The nanny put Cartman in the chair and said he couldn't move until the time was up. Then Cartman just jumped off and said, "woah, how did I do that?"
Sometimes abortions are very needed
Gizmos eyes going in different directions is everything to me 🥰🥰🥰
Stop swering
Gizmo!
Who thinks he is the right guy that’s the main character from after life? Cause I do😂
If i think this is bad u should see super nanny from Romania. A kid is playing with a knife
?
Ok
Omg Sheesh
Lol
just drop kick them, thats how i was raised
“KISS MY WILLY🙄”
is that a Boston terrier? because i have one
DazULTRA cleans up the depression
My mum would of ran at me with a wooden spoon 😱😱😱😱😱😱
UH
"And Joe frost is dressed like a Ikea couch"
If the boy bit me, I can’t promise that he wouldn’t have a hand print on his face
Hi
Gizmo is adorable, also did not seem impressed by any of it
That mom just needs some duck tape and it could solve a lot of her problems
Ur a goat daz ur a goat
Oh daz ur a goat
My opinion is your given a life at birth but never will you ever keep it you will get older you may get a baby anything
Daz: OW THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE T’’  Me: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Daz: continues the vid
The start with Gizmo was amazing
Hi
how does daz turn a two 2 minute videos into 15 minutes, it's amazing
Please tell me I'm not the only one that wants to take a paddle to that kid.. Uh.. jokes aside I do hope this mother got the help she needed
OMG WHAT BREED IS THAT
They be at the super market *WITHOUT MASKS* ?????
Adoption or death is the only way out
i <3 joe
That kid is using rage off of God of war
those kids need therapy
5:05 Daz just cracked me up its the way he said " AHHH HE BITEING"
Bro they should give him a black or Hispanic mother those kids would of been fixed by the end of a hour 💀
Do you know the scene where she was at the grocery store? And he was beating her up? I would grab the nearest can of tomato sauce and chuck it at the kids head. He may get a concussion but at least it’s a few hours of peace for me
EVEN BETTER
If I had those three children I may consider keeping The two girls but the toddler boy has to go I would get a priest and throw them into the nearest lake and have the priest blessed I don’t care if he lives I don’t care if he dies the waters blast so then it’s not my fault if he drowns
No I would literally strap them down to a demon star with candles around it and tape them in the middle and chant “ my child is shitty Satan please take my child!”
And I was like “ you can’t do that I’m going to kidnap your kids and I’m gonna raise them better“
The thing is my older sister when we were kids would always say that for children miss behaved she would scare them into behaving and she’d be a very stern and scary mother
Her greeting the children:  Me: LISTEN UP GURL I KNOW THAT AS SOON AS YOU GOT INSIDE YOU WAS GONNA BEAT THEM CHILDRENS UP,BUT I WONT LET YOU DO THAT BEFORE I CAN
A very exquisite ikea couch 👌👌👌👌
Giz is jojo reference
HE threw a dart at the mom!!!!!!
13:15 "i just wana reach in and help out and...."    My opinion: Punch the kids square in the face is what i would like to do
Yes I’m am that lonely person with dog 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
Yes I’m that lonely single man with a dog      What am I a the dog!?
All lined up like natnies 😂😂💀
In kindergarten I got a certificate for being the slowest worker and I got a really chewy candy. Now that I think back to that it’s a bit insulting
I’ve never seen a black family on this show
these kids need, just a week with slavic parents....
the kid threw a DART like jees
SPIDER-MAM
Daz I got a certificate for joining the school 😂 Tru story
you just have to teach the kids how to behave
Before my parents divorce my whole home was violent. My parents physically fought me and my brother fought and sometimes our parents fought us too and one day my mom just had enough and finally divorced my dad and then our house never had any arguments again.
Kids beating up parents if I did that I would I gotten a beating then be an orphan
You've watered your dog!?!
Put that kid in beyond scared straight and he will be the most behaved kid ever
Only true British people are watching this with a cup of tea ☕️
Daz ur so helpful. I'm trying to drown the sound of my dad screaming at the tv and ur the best way
Omg when he said gismo I almost cried bc my first dog s name was gismo and we had to give him away😭😭😭😭
why is no one complimenting Daz at 14:00 on like....
Sadly my mum isn't here any more, but I can still see 'that look' burning into me!!!!! I was a little shit growing up and used to see how far I could push the boundaries. One time she stood me and the doorstep to "cool off" and think about what I'd done. I wanted ti go back in but she wouldn't let me, so I shit in my knicks to rebel. On another occasion our neighbour came round to have a coffee with my mum, me and my brother were playing with a board game on the floor. Unfortunately my neighbour(female) had quite a substantial amount of facial hair and me and my brother were in a hysterical fit on the floor. Apparently mum and the neighbour heard what we were laughing at 😥 we suffered 'that look' for a week solid after!!!
That's why there's something called a belt
I stuck my tongue out and flipped my mama and I was on the trampoline and must be in about eight and she was walking awayWith a head turn to where she was walking start walking towards me I was terrified
Your my comfort youtuber literally my friend died today your just amazing and I liek to watch your content for comfort
Are you a single man  with a bog that you talk to lol bru
I think the kids are just Hiting there mom bec the the Camera is on
Cute dog
i just wanna know what the nanny did and if it was like in Nanny McPhee
I love how daz is so funny with everything but his so nice to the mum he must be such good in fact I knew he’s amazing
My mom always looks at like that to I feel like I’m going to get a fucking belt
I honestly wanna see a part two to this and see what he has to say about super nanny fixing the issues.
Yep no I'm adopting a child
My mum bit me so hard I bled
Your a good looking man
Why does gizmo look high
You can avoid this behavior with a simple ass beating lol
Facts When you do some thing then your mum laughs you. Know your fucked
One things that scares children just cry in front of them, it scared the shit out of them
I got an aword for being the loudest in my tutor
😗
It’s actually angrier eyebrows… but yeah that’s the look…
Seeing daz getting emotional over another persons life and wanting to help even though he can’t is so wholesome
* Stands on the table * Aaaaaaarrrrrraaaaaa
Daz talking about getting a girl pregnant: Me being gay
“ like little nazis”🤣💀
GIZMO
I don’t know why they won’t just beat them
You will also get MY BOOT
so i have a brother and me and him used to bet the hell out of each other and our dad would always have to stop us but we ignore him and instead started hitting him. he starts to yell for mom and immediately when she comes in the room she we just stop because we knew that when a parent has a belt in hand they will use it if necessary.
If that happens to my mom She would go get dad and the belt😂
Damn, the kids are like fuckin hyenas!
He went to get the milk
I have an Asian mother and ex-army staff sergeant father. I was like these kids for maybe 30 minuets in total of my entire childhood, teen years on the other hand...
I'm glad my parents weren't the only ones who bit us kids back 😂
If I even said $h1t my dad would grab a bar of soap and use my teeth as a grinder plus put liquid soap in my toothbrush so I couldn't just brush the soap off (I learnt my lesson very quickly)
so I watched the full episode of this before it was taken off of YouTube and the situation does get rectified, Reece and Shannon stop behaving like spoilt twats and Casey gets mums attention a lot of the time as well
If I acted like that and bit my mum like that I wouldn't have a head it'd be smacked off my shoulders
never thought Daz would give me sesxual advice
The Nazis
I love your dog
Daz had the opportunity to name his dog Jack Black.
97
Joe does fix it I've watched the entire episode and they are all well behaved now they do have slip ups every now and then like any child
Is it just one day he has a gf or wife the next he doesn’t how is he single
“YOUR RUDE”  🤣Really isn't gonna do anything🤣
if that was my kids it would be missing a head
smack the kid over the ear problem solved?
I'm making a tea as watching this. I'm waiting for the kettle to boil  🫖🫖🍵🍵😄😄
You got tea, I got RootBeer Float
Ahhhhhhh THAT WAS RIGHT IN The TIT!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 on a better note Gizmo is So adorable 😍😍😍
I told my mom that I would rather fist fight god while drunk then do anything to earn me a "mom look" from her.
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Ho need WWE when I can just watch this
im not going to lie i swear she works in my school
punishment today give then there i pad but remove the charger they will slowly watch it it die
confused
Whole-some con-tent
There lucky that there mum isn't ethnic they'd face the almighty grossby croc
We went to a gas station in a rundown town we used to live in and I said “Wow this place has gone to hell…” MY MOM WAS RIGHT THERE!! Nothing rythmes with hell sooooooo, but my mom was cool about it and realized that I hear it everywhere. She was just shocked. And make the look….
Daz: he’s adorable but he must be the hardest one  Me: yep I have a little cousin I know how he is😂😂😂😂
My future kids better not be like this
UK cripp's
Super nanny did nothing she just sat there and watched
But if your gay this doesnt apply lol
lol his imitation of his mum is my exactly what my mum does and probs all of u guys' mums
Well no Daz "be a man' does exist. It is a real thing. Trust me mate
please watch worlds strictest parents
The Nanny looks like Miss Trugpool from Matilda. Reply if u can see it.
The cut at 7:20
I’m 18 and my dad used to raise a hand I knew I fucked up 😂 sometimes you just gotta smack a bitch
I love how British people say the woohared there pets I thought u watered ur plants
14:37 a little white orb or something to the right of daz went across the screen 😂
Daz: that child is SUPER SATAN  stands on the table just like DJFIRNDNDISKFNF  Me:BAHAASAAAAAAASD
..          *d o g g y*
Those kids are lucky I’m not super nanny, if a kid hit me I would just hit them back.
If I just said no to my mum my mum would turn me into air literal oxygen
I liked when he was talking about biting, I got bit on my leg and the kid pierced my skin, and then fucking three weeks later I got bit on the arm by a different kid. I guess I just looked delicious
ur doggo is adorable
"And she's dressed like an Ikea couch" LMFAOO
Gizmo is just Spleens the dog and I mean that in the nicest way possible
Reese is a menace
You gotta make this a series!!
“That’s how I get mums attention, I just relocate her jaw.”🤣🤣
I dont know if you will respond to this but why are you infront of green screen of your room
Daz please try watching "me or the dog" it's Victoria Stilwell and some videos are hilarious
That's not giz that's iggy 😂😂
When he said some kids gonna get drop kicked across the living room and then acts so calm after  Me- laughing hysterically 😂😂😂
SMACK HIM WITH AN IPAD is iconic
If you don’t mind answering this how old is Sahara now?
omg your dog is so cute
the mum obviously taught the boy the swear words because she was probably saying it infront of him
I do not support this, I’d like to make that abundantly clear. Dealing with children should not involve violence. That being said, idk how these children aren’t scared to act like this.  If I did even a portion of what they’re doing to my mother she’d kill me on the spot. It doesn’t matter if I was just born or if I’m 200 years old, she’ll end my life.  (Again, do not threaten your children. Do not hit your children)
I whating for Daz to say she looks like a fater marrie Poppins
if these were my kids, they getting pinned like a dog. Just gently sit on them while theyre face down so they cant do shit.
I legit farted while laughing at that part 7:48🤣🤣🤣🤣OMG some kid is gonna get drop kicked across the living room😂😂😂😂😂😂
14:15 use the morning after pill
Welcome to another episode of fax watches a 2 minute video in 15 minutes...
What i'm about to say normally leads to a long and rather "heated" debate but anyway...just beat the kids ass, pow pow- they'll learn.
My mom will just fucking drop kick me to mars😂😂😂😂
Daz: someone is abt to get dropkicked across the living room.    Me:😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Ok but that uniform is my school-
Those kids are fucking insane
She is so a curtain
When that kid got thumped
Cute little dog 🐶
Watch sqid game
No the most effective birth control is a gun  Come on down to you local guns and ammunition store to pick up some of your very own child repellent some of our more famous repellents are the g18, g19 and if you happen to get yourself in a worse situation our m18 shotguns are very effective as they take out more than one target at a time and are very powerful...at dodging child support
A quite angered mother is scary
Dear daz react to lil yay she is rude pure rude :>
Bro daz teaches me so much
its like Spiderman but she was bitten by another mum
i wouldve punted that child
Wow  Daz im a fan
Honestly just fucking hit them and hit them sooo hard
Dont give the dog coffie flavored cheying gum man  he gonne pull out the fool
5:43
12:53 I would’ve threw him in the water
my 6 year old sister is way more well behaved than any of them :/
I’d smack the holy crap out of all of them if they hit me
And joe is dressed like a ikea couch
:0 my dog is called gizmo!
the camera man must be invisible
To be fare blue is pretty cool color
Birth control 👍
I have milk 🥛
Watch the episode were the mum makes her children DRINK soap 🧼
Daz once said: some kid is going to get dropped kicked across the living room
when I was put in the naughty spot [ in Ireland we call it timeout , you sit on the stairs and whatever age you were was how many minutes you stayed like for my brother its 6mins bc he is 6yo]  I used to walk to the top of the stairs to the bathroom, get my Nintendo and play with it fo a couple of minutes goo back downstairs and ye. another time when I was smaller I used to talk to my baby cousin who was dead he died as a baby like 8 years before I was born lol but ye id talk to dead relatives
Sssuper sssiayn
My friends just told me to watch this random vid bcs it’s funny. Let’s see how it goes
Can you plzz react to words strictest parents it has realy bad teens and they go to a strict parents houses
The dog
Daz where the hell is the goth dab and the moth grab
#dog
okay that’s it i’m never having kids omg i’m not made for that shit  if my child behaves like this is beat the fuck out of him
Daz is a father figure to me. All of my past step dad's and dad, have gone to prison. I love you daz
Hey daz you should play fnaf security breach! It’s the newest fnaf game it’s so cool and I think you’d enjoy it. Another good one is dangranronpa :))
If I did any of that to my mom I'd get my ass beat then they would be like "get you ass in corner"
Blue doesn’t that mean is blues clues
Omg some kids gonna get dropp kicked across the living room
Love how at the end he goes into a speech abt having kids and stuff
I got a reword for the best hair
See instead of the “naughty step” I’d have the prison cell. A room in the house with absolutely nothing in it.
when he said ''I fed you I've watered you'' it sounds like he's talking to a  plant.
I wouldnt hit my children but if they are lile this i would
man turned into super nanny himself lol
The way you said he just Beating the shit out of every where
I’m realizing that I was a pretty good kid even though I am autistic and had like a bunch of meltdowns I never had any violence
If I did that I would be in heaven
Even thought the kids are little brats, Daz makes this video absolutely hysterical (as always)
Daz can you answer me on Snapchat pls
Embrace the meow meow
if i ever did any of that to my mom i wouldn't have been able to sit down for a year or two
i got an “award” for most likely to spill milk in daycare once😃🤚
Not him
Just whack 'em with a wooden spoon, that'll straighten them out
To
Is daz single then how does he have a kid
0:18 why does it have a red eye
Daz:”They give a certificate for everything nowadays” Me:”Yeah my stister got one for attending school no joke”
This is miss das 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
THIS IS The M I
My first time watching your videos and they are amazing and sooooooooo funny
i love how daz takes a two minute video and turns it into a 15 minute one
This is still funny 3 months later
SHORTEND SCENTECE OR FREEDOM
Daz:she is dressed like an ikea couch  me:laughs till I pee myself *
ohh my god that bot isss deadd
Thats when u know you're gonna die lol 🤣🤣🤣
"go my god, some kid is going to get drop-kicked across the living room"
Back in day we had a thing called a “slap”
7:44
0:33 then who linda TELL ME
Daz u should be the new super nanny
My parents used to use the naughty step but it didn't tend to work bbecause I would have fun on the step by telling myself stories. 😂
This is my cuz
BEAT them    Hard.
My mum used to put me on the naughty step when I never did anything bad and I would get the blame because I'm the youngest so of course it wasn't my sisters being bad 🙄. So I would always be in tears
God forbid my family goes over there those kids will be set straight in seconds
Daz's words of wisdom: those are Satan!
If a 4 year old kid is closing the door on you      Kick the door
Has anyone told you your dog looks like iggy from jojo
Look yes I’m incredibly late but I’m one of the only people that I know that has 2 adults to look after me and I am incredibly happy and greatful
If I'm the mom I would tape my kid in the fucking sealing fan
“Like little nazis😊” LMAO
Dad is the best
You know that screwdriver that the kid Throuh at his mom well that was actually a dart.
Daz please react to jeffy
I hit my mom once….                     I got hit back and I never did it again…….
I will have quipping depression
Dazs poor dogs ears are going to explode in the intro 😭😂
People wonder why i say I don't want fucking kids
Nice dog👍
who created ur daughter then if your dingle
Did y'all here him say kiss my wheely
If I had dared to rage at my mother as a child...... Well I would be here to type this
belt
You know what really pisses kids off? When they do that, and you tell them to walk away from you. Changes their tune fast.
Were the kids on drugs??
A silent angry mother……..is a killer
Lol          I love this guy
I discovered him on tiktok
Reese appears on camera:  Also reese:  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA     mf went super saiyan
I HAVE MY TEEEAAAAAA
and sarah...
Your Funny
LOL IM DYING ON THE BEGINNING OF THE DOG PART
I’ve been through a lot of stress and you just make my day and i love your vids they make me happy
Once my sister bit my mom and it was so unexpected my moms flight of fight response kicked in and punched my sister
I have had multiple wooden spoons Brocken cause my parents hit me so hard with it🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Jesus lord help my child if he ever swears at me
Or instead of a super nanny u could just beat them into listening
my mom bit me too and i never even thought about bitting anyone ever again
Instead of the dad running off it was my mother that took off later when I was 6-8
See this is why I could never have children. Because my temper is short and if my child did this ONCE I would relocate their spine and throw them across the room.
Daz did you know you made this video on my birthday :) YAYY ty now I feel special :>
I love this video so much. I just love Daz in general! He is the most funniest and the best person ever!!
im an 18 year old mom, my daughter is nearly 2 now, me and my partner are still together we have been together since we were 14, but in august he moved 2 hours away to go to college were still in a relationship but its now long distance and i see him every 2nd to 3rd weekend, i couldnt move with him and im left to do everything by myself, hes a great dad when hes here he looks after her the entire time hes here but obviously when hes here i want to see him too so i never get away i never get a break and especially with covid i cant just get a babysitter and go out when i could end up bringing covid around my child. i dont have friends anymore because they want to party and i cant, im a mom whos in college doing a makeup course and im currently opening my own business so i just never have time for myself and im starting to resent him for leaving, i hate that he moved so far away for college when theres a college where we live and he didnt even apply for the college in our town, im paranoid when hes gone and i resent him and this is only the first year he has 3 more years after this, what the hell do i do?
ngl i remember i would perpously pisss all over the naughty step so my mum would have to move me and id keep doing it till id pissed on all the stairs 😭😭
rather then supernanny jsut send the kids to a north korean school i bet they wont mouth off anymore
I hate the mom look
Why do kids act like this? I'm 15 and I was a really well-behaved kid when I was young I was chill, never had a tantrum if I ever did get upset my mom would just talk to me or I'd go draw out my anger. Maybe it's just me, I don't know.
:0 your dog is so cute and the part was says "WHY ARE THEY ALL WEARI MY BLUE?!Oh..wait.the children are fine their wearing school uniform." or something like that was the big that made me laugh to death 😭✋
“Ahh! He’s biting!” Thanks for the milk coming out of my nose 😂
I love when dogs have those eyes😊
Wholesome content 🐕‍🦺🐕🤍
YOUR DOG SHOULD HAVE THE NAME DAZZLE😃🐶✨☀️💫⭐️⚡️⭐️I’m so smort.smort is smart btw
Like
I need a friend ;ike you daz
Them kids need a swift slap 👋 that’ll straighten them out. No discipline 😅
Daz around 15:00 min gives like the best parenting advice
When a kid bites you, don't you put the kid in a headlock?
Hoha, time for a rea partyyyyyyyyy 🍵
“Kiss my Willy” I died😭😭
every time someone says they watered there dog I always think you took a watering can  and watered your dog like a plant
Man if that was my kid 💀😂
The end was near but it disappeared daz is so lucky
that kid ganster
Your dogggg 😘😘😘😘
"You'll also get my BOOT"
Can you let us watch in peace you pause it 5 seconds later
If I ever did that I would be 6ft in the ground
He is so hilarious.
Daz is like a father to us
Jokes and wisefracks aside, Daz is a really cool guy. Like he has this huge audience and can easily just focus on jokes for views, but still takes an opportunity to even try and reach out to younger audiences and tell boys to take responsibility if they accidentally have a kid. I respect that.
When the little girl slapped the mom it made me me want to pick up the child and body slam it
girls get hormoneal because of their periods and its a girls choice to go on birth control a boy has no choice to make a girl go on birth control
Were is the shoe
I got a reward which made me sad. For walking into a gate🤣
20 on the little child

I'm Now Dying to see Daz as Super Nanny !! In his Blue Ikea Sofa Suit !

Putting them for adoption is the only way

Is it just me who thinks super nanny talks like she’s on a cooking show
“Oh my god.. some kids going to get dropped kicked across the room” 🤣🤣
How’s it Goin dazzlers welcome back to Daz Games it’s a day I’m gonna be showing you how to put kids up for adoption😂
So fun story when I was two I bit my sister and my step dad at the time thought the punishment of biting me was good, but not like what he was talking about I mean this dude bit me hard enough to leave marks and bruises luckily I no longer live with him and my birth mom anymore since that incident so yay me!
I don't have tea cause it's 1:22 in the morning
Hi
Actually my mum has like four kids
My mom is the same way. She is absolutely TERRIFYING when she's mad... and she doesn't say a word.  I also used to mock my parents when I'd get yelled at. Moral of the story, don't piss off my mom, you won't live to tell the tale.
Daz yo so funny
'I've watered you'  is the best thing I've ever heard
STOP IT RIGHT NOE THE DOG IS SO ADORABLE
Mum gets battered everywhere she goes, everywhere she goes
DAZ: omg some kids are gunna get drop kicked across the living room

I had no more earl grey left so I had to improvise and make iced tea🤣
I love watching Daz

Is it just me or is his dog a Jojo reference
This man makes me laugh every time I watch him
Why is it that the European kids are always so aggressive and extreme US Canadian kids we're too polite to be that rude and extreme we have our moments but they're like aggressive but not that bad moments Canadians are just very polite people especially as kids
I'm going to be honest to you Daz you're one of the greatest parents I've ever seen your daughter is amazing and she's very talented just like you
AHHHHH HES BITING
AHHHH that was right in the TIT 🤣🤣🤣😝
'And Joes dressed up as an ikea couch' 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

"Pull my hair back, and put me in blue!" You'd be fabulous!

GIZZ
On the shop, did Reese say “kiss my Willy” ?!?
If I was ever disrespectful or did shit because I didn’t get what I wanted in the store my mom would just leave the shopping cart and drive home.
Just cry in front of them.. then they freak out and care about you… I think 🤔
This is definitely one of the most funniest videos you made
11:28 *kiss my Willy*    BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Sfzg

Kiss ma willeh 😂😂😂this lil 4 yo
when me and my brother got into fights, one of use was told to sit on the step in the kitchen while the other sat on another step in what we call the green area (cuz the floor was green) and we just had to sit and be quiet no talking not getting up for food or drinks until we were allowed to move, that or we have to stand bare foot in the hall way against the wall which really hurt our feet and made them really cold so it hurt a bit but yea. They stopped those punishments after a while cuz we stopped fighting but we've been fighting more recently and i think he almost broke my arm at one point threw a cage at me (nearly broke my bloody nose doing that ) and yea well my mum she doesn't  do anything she's just gotta put her finger up and we leave (like leave her room, or where ever she is) and yea she does yell a lot tho, which is kinda scary she throws stuff sometimes and yea we're used to it by now but eh  (sorry for any spelling errors) this was on the topic of what daz was talking about around 10:40
hi          ⭐it is not a mistake⭐ it is a master piece⭐
If that was me I would be dead 🪦
just by watching this i know i'm gonna be a crap dad cos if my kids hit me like that i'm uppercutting him to mars and back
Stern mother fear
i always mock my mom behind her back
THESE KIDS  ARE SATAN
imagine you being his dad you will dropkick him across the living room
You need to Tryout are being a Comedian
my grandmother bit me after i bit my sister. I never bit again
his dog is a frickin legendary, and I’m talking LEGENDARY
a girl at my primary school got a certificate for not being scared of bees
I have a dog named gizmo too!!
I would've gone to jail for child abuse😂
No one: the first kid literally being bakugou
OMG THE MEME! 7:48-7:53 AHHH I FOUND IT
Not that Reece
My name is Reece
Whats the dog breed?
KiD OF dA yEaR
I love this channel 😂🤣😂🤣
i love daz storys there are so funny
Daz: if you get a girl pregnant Me being a trans man: 👁👄👁
The only thing i watch on yt is super nanny and daz😭
The kids can run but the belt is faster
I litterally got an ad about calming the mind and meditating 😹
I mock my mum all the time
The best thing ever is just scrolling thru daz comments while watching its just awesome love u daz
Dqy 1 of asking Daz to play security breach,  ok here it goes; Please play security  breach^^
Michael Myers: 6 year old boy with the blackest eyes, the devils eyes  Sarah black: 6 year old girl with the blackest eyes, Michael Myers eyes 👀 whole point is that’s kinda weird she turned out to be violent same age Michael did hella crazy and cool lol I love Michael myers
If my mom saw me do the middle finger even at a rock she’s teleport to me from a mile away and try to break my hand
every time I think about having kids, I watch supernanny, her show is the best birth control
Dam I'd get dropkick across the universe
I like your clickbatie songs
Parent tip: if they bite you smack the shit out of them 🤣 I'm jk
Sorry daz but you should have said that to my father "don't run off and take the responsibility, a baby could always happen" imma tell my brother to watch you, respect through the roof <3
Let me just say if I ever acted like that with my mother I wouldn't be here anymore, she would have disowned me right on the spot 😂
I feel really bad for the shit I put my parents through alot of people blame it 100% on parenting when  it can be genetics or simply different personalitys my brothers and my sister are and was goody goods never got in trouble once there report cards were completely perfect I was kicked from 12 schools and had detentions everyday and never went to one we was raised the same the only difference is I have PDA and had natural behaviour problems because I was different from my siblings not because of my parents I have my own personality my own problems and experiences and my own brain with its own issues and benefits same with my siblings if I did something bad I was punished my parents stopped me from reaching my bad potential parenting is still a factor so if you have a naughtychild tell them off even if it doesn't seem to work because if you except it and ignore it then it will get worse and they will do stuff even when they are adults..
do that sh*t in sweden OH BOY U ARE DED.
Mistake child
14:55 respect
It’s the part when he says joe stood in the Conner like a curtain with her hair tided back so far u can see he scalpe it made me hurl with laughter!!!!!! 😂😂😂
My mom wants a smooshed face dog everyone else dose not and that's imbetween it's not smooshed but it's not like fr example like a Labrador
What breed is the dog
Look at joe standing  there…. Looks like a curtan! So funny
your dog is so cute😃😃😃
Yummy mummy
can we just notice how neerly all of super nannys vids are in the uk lol
The thing is, my mum will check every 2 mins when I’m on the step. :( never moved
I can see it now daz as a dad oh u wanna talk back boom knocked tf out
The dog is adorable
Ruby rube reacted to you XD
Daz I admire
OMG A CHILD IS Going to get dropped kicked across the living room ITS A TIKTOK TREND
Even I was wearing blue when watching this lmao.
Joe mama🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"Wholesome content" LMAO
"yes I am that lonely single man with a dog." Same but I'm a girl 😂
Daz…you haven’t screamed at Linda in a while… is she still living?
My mom grounds me and takes my phone just for looking at her wrong so if i did this i would've already been at the adoption center
I would never hit my mom but when i was around 5 i tried to fight my mom but i never hit her
daz you are right the little one is allways the worst
the kid went super sang 3
thats me the little one
I actually went to that school it’s called dowlais primary school
1:22 “and jo frost is dressed like and ikea couch!“ WHAT THE HECK? 😂😂😂
“she looks like a curtain”😭😭😭😭😭😭
U see I have anger issues so I would probably hit my child back 😃
✨✨Respect the dazzling ✨✨✨✨
Arabic people watching this be like 👁👄👁
Get the wooden spoon sounds whacking
Daz: “I can see it in your eyes…”  The eyes: cross eyed, one blinking
11:28 ‘’kiss my willy’’ absolute shite people those kids are surrounded by. They don’t just learn curse words by themselves.
I watered you
i just had my first daughter im 19 and she just turned 6 months old legit the best thing thats ever happend in my life
Is that Iggy
14:20 daz:be a man, theres no such thing. me: amazing men are now non existent brilliant problem solved
The only thing I'm gonna say is I would put that kid on a T-shirt 😂
just cut the damn hands off when he starts throwing hands
DAZ YOU HAVE TO REACT TO "BLIPPI" it will get you so many view (his a kids show person that is like realy realy weird and yeah it funny
Why isn’t Dax on supper duper nany
He can have just bread
“You’ll also get MY BOOTS!!” Dead😂
That's incorrect. Working daycare is pretty good birth control. Also, a lot of women use it for controlling their period. Just sayin...
When I went demonic as a child, my parents would spank the shit out of me...
His accent is everything 😭😭✨✨
Daz: i can see it in ur eyes His dog: looks blankly at the camera
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh he’s bitten 😂😂
“Kiss my Willy”🤣🤣🤣
At the shopping market part the young one says “kiss my w!lly”
Is that Iggy???
that dog is a jojo reffrence
Daz,"JUST BITE HIM"
Daz makes me laugh every time I watch him 😂
Bruv I was beaten if I did 1 disrespectful thing  Why not just give em a proper hiding like the old days cuz that was effective no a chance my child would talk to me like that or even try to beat me
AWWW YOUR PUPPY 🥺
if i did that stuff i would be lucky if i was disowned and the naughty spot was the corner for me  and i would stay there for hours and seeing those kids im just like "nope"
Hasbulla vs him
This is so relatable because my younger brother who also is 4 bites so much 🤣🤣🤣🤣
7:48 little mans turning Scottish
DAZ NOT JUST FUNNY --- BUT DECENT ADVICE AS WELL.
IS THERE A DAD -- SO SORRY FOR MUM --- SHE IS OUT OF HER DEPTH --- WITHOUT ANY HELP.
THE KIDS WERE TOLD TO BE NAUGHTY --- MAKES NANNY LOOK GOOD --- TILL NANNY GETS STABBED.
Got them lined up like little nazis 😂
“She’s got em all lined up”  killed me 💀
🤣😚🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
I bit my sister one time and my parents tied me tot eh dogs leash outside because you know some dogs bite people, for like 30 minutes, i never bit anyone again
Bro that kid would not last a second in an MMA ring
This is why I’m gay
its not daz games anymore its now Nazis Games. Sorry Das your dog has overtaken your chanel 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If that was my child i’m gonna slap him into heaven
Your dog looks like he needs some cheering up🤣🤣🤣
My friend used to bite and slap people at a young age and get sent to anger management😂
The mom look is the look that all people are scared of
Aww cute pug I got a pug called shadow
"it's like spider man but she was just bitten by another mum" 😭😭
5:05 lol
If my child bit my leg I would Personally lock him out of my house and throw pebbles at him from the window
0:00 to 0:31 are so cute
I guess gizmo is a plant because he needs to water him
IGGY
When shareen slapped her mum I said " I like your cut ge "
Reece: “kiss my wi**y”  Daz: *does not care*
Daz needs to watch more Supernanny 100%
7:52      "Oh my god some kids gonna get drop kicked a cross the living room" - Daz 2022
Gizmo is a jojo reference
GIZMO is adorable 😍 Also my neice years ago when I had a frog named him Mr. Gizmo Frog
6:30  I love how she’s just cowering in the background
I punched my dad and then my dad punched me 🤣😭😭
Daz saying that its normal for kids to act like this. I know as an older brother for a fact that if u beat the shit out of your younger brother it teaches him not to hit and it also teaches him how to defend himself. I reckon if this little prick had an older brother sticking up for his mum then he wouldnt be like this.
Wowzers/ my name is Shannon and I swear I never acted like that 😂
Me, a 23 yr old: *parents describing me as a nightmare as a toddler* WELL IM NOT THIS SHANNON AT LEAST 💀
My respect for daz went 📈📈📈
Lol dotfire love it
MY DOGS NAME IS GIZMO :))  ( just felt like sharing.. ps: love you daz :D )
Most hilarious person on YouTube by FAR😂😂
IT BITES IT BITES!
I’m sorry but little British kids swearing is so funny😭😭
Millatary school scars the shi* out of me to like that works
My dogs name gizmo
LOLLL WHEN THE LITTLE BOY SAID 'kiss my willy!"
I watched Mrs doubtfire yesterday
my dad does the mum look very well but only if i talk back to him sarcastically. my mum and i share our sense of humor so we insult each other whenever the other gives an opportunity.
I have the same headset
Daz needs a pedastool for his dog to sit in during vids… I love the dogs eyes. (And yours daz)
who heard of this first before watching the video "omg a child is about to get drop kicked across the living room" this makes me laugh everytime i hear this
7:42   Ayo- I cant be the only person who didnt know the tiktok came from this video Thats awesome- when you just stumble into famous memes outta no where
“Look they’re all lined up like little n@$!$” 😭😂
and this is why i believe we should put all babies/toddlers on an island so they can fight for the right to live, and live among us in society
Daz: kid are like that are comen    Me: 👁👄👁 me getting chased down the hallway so ummm ......😐
I mastered the ' Silent but raging' mom face from babysitting my younger siblings all the time
11:26 "kiss mah willy" lol🤣
Just wondering if spanking is illegal or sth coz I haven't noticed them mention it
in my house a slap is the worst and the most disrespectfull thing to do to your family.If  i woud slap my mother i woud be slaped two times and probably get kicked out the house :-:
Hi daz my name is cody ray steen nroth amerca iam a huge fan i want to meet you
WAS THAT THE BITE OF 83 ?!
that dog was definetly pulled out of the screen from jojos   ITS IGGY
He’s the fucking Hulk 😂😂😭😭
God gave us all a teachers ruler to teach our children called “your hand”
I would love to see Daz as a Super Nany Lmao. Please make a video of that.
I had the naughty step when growing up and I just went up the rest of the stairs to my room, they trusted me enough that I wouldn't move, they were wrong.
3:56 to me this looks more like she slapped him really fucking hard and he started hitting her afterwards. I clearly see a slap and then him falling down backwards in the backround.
Wheres the nanny from grandma simulator shit she'll kick him out of the house literally
Dude that 4 y old should be my brothers twin : same age, bites, MMA moves,swears, mum does nothing about it😂💀💀, no joke
“Like little Natzies” 🤣🤣🤣(excuse my spelling)
Hi
Damn— I wish my father seen the part near the end before he left my 2 half siblings that I don’t even know and me lol
Awww he’s no longer with his girlfriend 🥺 I can’t spell her name. Lol I wish them both the best
I love you so much my dad left me when I was 2 so that hit hard and you make me so happy.
I LOVE GIZMO LMAO
All I can think of when I see Daz’s dog is his dentist story
If you have a kid don't want it Go get milk  like my dad
uh anyone else notice that he sid hes single nd them he said mum??
"She's got them all lined up, like little Nazis." Ruuuuhhh.. That got me. LMFAO!
The dog is so cute
I swear the kid said at the shop ‘shut up and kiss my willy’
I watched this late at night and had a nightmare
Daz I would just like to say thank you ok when you reacted to this vid I could relate my brother has autism and he gets into fights with my mom and we don't have a dad and we are vary poor and she's under a lot of stress and now I know I really need to step up and help her thank u
Anyone else love Gizmo?
5:39 ”These kids are ŚÀTĘÂN”
I have Percy pigs
for the part when he talks about men running off when a child is born just abort it
All my pain went away after finding this channel
Daz:” before you say, yes I am that lonely man with a dog”😂
I wouldn't be suppressed if the kid puts an axe through the door and says "HeReS ShAnNoN"
‘She’s got them all lined up, like little Nazis’   That’s going in the quote book. 😂
awww the dog is so cute
oh I did the biting thing as well
8:02 true life lessons with Daz
"I fed you , I watered you"
This should be called WWE kid remastered
My uncle and his girlfriend became teen parents at age 15, and shockingly enough, it was actually the MUM that left. He’s left to raise their two kids on his own, but we’re all proud of him.
The mum should just get an air soft gun 😂
If those were my kids and they treated me like that the only response would be a rear naked choke
"Oh my, some kid is going to be drop kicked across the loving room" got me dead💀
The scariest thing is when your parent gives you the silent dead stare
“Like little Nazis” Daz- 2021
‘Council estate version of mrs doubtfire’ 😂 😂
Super nanny:stands there Super nanny:stays there for 3938829 years Super nanny:dose nothing Me:👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
Tie all of them to the couch for like and hour or two
Since when can you water a dog!!!! 🤣
Ur story about mom mate so true mate
If I ever become a dad, I’m most certainly listening to Daz’s wisdom and looking to him for advice. Look at him, one of the best dad’s on the planet.
IS THAT A JOJO REFRENCE..? 0:01
Dude's dogs eyes where social distance
Daz: I’ve got my tea hope you do too  Me: I have champagne, does that work?
Anybody else watching this like yo how did they not die cuz my mom would beet the f##k out of me like dam  lol 😂
Your dog looks very nice and cute
Good thing I’m gay-
I would use a head lock and belt on these kids
Btw when I'm a BAD boy my mom does the same thing daz explained
I'm from 2022 if u read from 2023 be the mum in the video but come in peace
I’ve been watching my two little siblings since I was 8 and I’m now 15 almost 16 and they’ve told me to die and hit me so I know how this mom feels
Daz: Gives genuinely good parenting advice.  Also Daz: *HANDCUFF HIM!*
Can I get a ahaha ahaha ahaha
Good video
I don't know if it's just My mum or parents in general but if I even layed one finger on my mum I would already be down at the local orphanage and if I did what that kid did I would be lucky even if I did get to the orphanage bc I'd probably end up on the front lawn😂
I cam verify that super nanny is the best birth control! Me and my Nannie use to watch it together when I was a kid. Guess what, I DONT WANT CHILDREN! EVER. I am 18 and certain. No thank you! I will stick to animals
So when I was young and I did something really bad and my mom told me to sit on the naughty step and she said when she says I can leave I can leave and then me after 2 days LIKE BRO?!!
“Shiniest shoes” 😂😂
Daz did your teacher just looked at you she and went “yea, he needs a certificate for that pair of shoes” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hmmm thats our England we do this  and not gonna lie i still attack sht.  Also my brother is evil hesays death threats.and wen he hits our mum she hits him bac and he becomes silent for the rest of the day but he still hits her but less often.   He knows that if he attacks me he getting a broken jaw.  Edit. again
The best quote: “wholesome content”.
You should do more dazy
if i was that mum i would take my shoe of and wack all the way to spain i would not care if he be crying
You are  funny
Daz you have to react to people removing crazy make up looks🤣
My mum is also scary she makes me cry
Yo is that a jojo reference 😱
He's soo cute the dog is sooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute
Yea about boys/men leaving my mom was pregnant with me and my dad left her as soon as she told him he was pregnant and he acts like that never happened and always wants to see me and I want to see him to but my mom says no just bc he’s poor😞 now I have a stepdad who is very kind and loving but everyday I wish to meet my dad
I never bit some basterd when I was wee, but for fuck i got accused for biting and this was p1 tae p3  But then at p4 it stopped. Where has it gone? Tae another unlucky idiot
Did ENGLISH DAZ JUST SAY MATH!
they're both twins and ones just really bad at math lmfao
all lined up. Like little Nazis.
I would beat the shit out of them like you need to have some maniers... my dad would beat me with vacum cable prob at that point.... just hit the kids and t bag them at the end
I would've got the shit slapped out of me if I hit my mom
If those kid were were African…… OOOOOH BOY THOSE KIDS WOULD BE PROPER DISCIPLINED 😂🤣
11:29 DID HE SAY "kiss my willy"
Daz:  he's beating the p*** out of his mum.    Daz's hand: <---  ---> <--- --->
Why did the mom just not put the 4 Year old kid in an Orphan
HAAA TIME FOR A SHOE PARTYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That lil boy baby hulk
I love boston terrious
11:15 he Is Just Beating The Piss Out of His Mom! Lol

The stern mom look made me shiver, I grew up in the Southern US and if your mother gave you that look or called you by your full name or both you knew you were in deep shit.
CUTE DOG SHOW HIM MY AVATAR HE MIGHT LIKE IT
This was made on my birthday
My names Rhys ahhhhhhh I promise I’m not like that 😫😫🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He always make my day shine
That 'mom look' was the most accurate childhood trauma 😂😅
9:59 i said the exact same thing LOL
Ok but when i was little i would get angry at my mum then yell at her go to my room for 5 minutes to think about what ive done then go say sorry or else i would get the evil eyes 0_0
Did you name him gizmo after gizmo from gremlins? I’m just kinda curious bc I don’t know if gremlins was big over in the uk as well
I really would not have the patience id just abandon them
Gizmos eyes: ᴑ   »ᴑ
This is why you should be allowed to smack your kids, they’re all turning into brats these days thinking they can do whatever they want, end up getting their face bounced of a kerb or thrown in a prison cell.
The fact my dog is also named Gizmo--
No shit he’s gone
14:23 this hit hard (my dad left when I was about 3, apparently he was abusive)
The best words from daz: BITE HIM
Put him In wwe
The dad left for the milk
Not me having flashbacks to daz's tiktok where he called the dog a boggle-eyed panda 😭😂
I don’t know how you did this naughty spot but for me it was stand in the Corner with 1 foot up
Ever tried hitting your child one word at a time? Don't, you, ever, Efin, do, that, again
If I was like that to my parents I would get the ever living shit beat out of me
Just give the kid a air sandwich
This is the best condom commercial i've ever seen
Dad always fills me with joy when I’m sad.And I love it how he is always hyper 😂😂😂😂😂
Poor mom she feels like leaving. That is dust sad.
omg this man is so funny
If my children will be like this imma get the strongest nerf blaster in the store not online cuase god dawn online and shoot them if there bad
Put them for adoption
Your dog is so cute
I felt that when he hit the tit 😔
Uhhh.  “Pull my hair back, and put me in blue” -Daz 2021
“Oh my god he’s gonna get dropkicked across the living room” 😂🤣
Nobody Daz: joe is dressed like an ikea crouch
Y'know... Maybe child abuse isn't so bad. /j
15:42  Younger Daz: there nothing really keeping me on this spot.   Me: honey you had it good I got yelled at hit then put in a room door locked, toys what are they, cry smack across the face
Idea here get a pattle spank them with that or a wooden spoon
Yall eat breakfast
“all lined up, like little nazis”🤣🤣🤣🤣
My mom bit my brother to stop him from biting people and he just laughed
i love Gizmo he's so cute
Hi welcome to my Ted talk so problematic  child?, OK grab them by the hair open a window and just pick that basted up and just weeee they can fly now 😁
The oldest looks done, she seems like she is just the same as the mum
imagine all the kids on super nanny watching super nanny in the future they would be so embarrassed
I get daz white tea party tomorrow 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Am sorry but I would just love for Daz to put giz dog bed or like a pillow giz can seat on and just have him always in the background of videos, just randomly zoom in on his face XD
I got a good egg award????
My dogs call gizmo
I’m sorry but we’re gizmos eyes going in DIFFERENT FUCKING DIRECTIONS
14min well said
I’m really mental I still bite 👹😈
i thought daz had kids
Bro I’d just slap the absolute shit out of those kids if they were my kids😂
Ruby said my biggist hater daz games i said how i he mean
omg i could not stop laughing XD
His words are idk how to say it just clap clap 👏
And that’s why you beat your children
You are not wrong with that look
*daz ranting about his mom moment*  *me watcching it while my mom is next to me*
The nanny: it’s disgusting how that kid speaks Me:your tan is disgusting you orange
He deserves some one good :(
Daz should make a patreon of asmr or sleep aids, or edited clips, it would be funny
I like how U just Phil the T out like bitch
UWU uwu
I'm scared Edna
OMG I HAVE A DOG NAMED GIZMO
Am i the only one who forgot that he has a daughter😆
I was really upset I went to my room to have some space and the first thing I thought of watching was daz you make me feel so happy you are amazing  Love all your videos your so funny  Keep it up 👍 😂😊🙂
I swear Daz could do a Ted talk on parenting
It's 3am hear my hole family is asleep and I'm laughing I'm scared I'm going to wake them all up 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Im eating a muffin while dying of laughter trying not to choke lmaoooooooooo Daz is one of the youtuber who is TRULY funny 💖💖💖
How did a 4 year old know how to swear and it killed me when daz said       "ooh someones gonna get dropp kicked across the living room"
Gizmo is a Jojo reference
I died when he said: relocate her jaw
More scarier daz 🤨
0:35 daz is single ??
I’ve never wanted kids and as I’ve grown up my feelings against them has only grown and grown
I got a fucking certificate for being ‘chatty’ 🤣🤣
F hf  bbt
my brother is named rhys to and he’s 5 and he is like this little boy but at a lower level
Hi… find a daz vid I have not commented at✨✨✨
No but the way Daz can just understand and wants to do everything to help out with her and her children
My mum put these gate things around my naughty spot and I used to sit there and scream while destroying the gate lol
When Daz said bloody Jesus I thought my phone was lagging
You know what I would’ve done. I would disown them see how long they last😅
The  thing that he threw at his mom was a dart
Idk why supernanny just stands there doing nothing for most of the time
6:10 same here I has so violent from the age of 6 to where I am now 12. We have been to 5 doctors and now we are getting me a autistic test.
I love your Contin🌻🦋
The dog looks like iggy from jjba
This is a good idea
If I did any of this stuff I’d be meeting Jesus earlier than planed
i was in middle school and my school had called my mom and said I wasn't doing my work when I got home my mom was telling me all the ways i should listen and do better in school I didn't mean to but I started laughing and she gave me that look lol
I feel terribly bad for that mother, i really hope everything gets better.
Getting wwe show
I can’t misbehave as my mums European so if I say anything bad I am out the house
Video 2:26 Daz games video 15 mins
My dad don't run of I killed him 😂😂😂😂👌👌as🔫🔫🔫🔫

Hi @YouTube
Add 11:30 on the vid does the kid say Kiss my W**ly like it might be a bit beforw
this video was so funny that i couldnt even breathe also keep up the amazing work.
That women reminds me of my music teacher and I don’t like it
That dog in intro looks sooo cute
Also...if I had done any of these things growing up I would have gotten punched into the next century. I preferred when they took my things instead. Can't help but cringe, I know If I did any of that my mom prolly would have like... Unmade me o.o poof
No video games, no toys, no tv, only books. If they can't read oh well. 2 weeks. This is what happened to me as a child, they also took all the furniture in my room, my dresser, my bed stand, and my sheets. I got one books, and my mattress on the floor. Sometimes I didn't even do anything and that would happen to me. And that's for having a messy room! Not saying would do all that to my future child, but the no tv, no video games, and only books for 2 weeks I will do. It was hell.
I got a award for having the biggest scar on my face lol 😂😂😂😂
“she’s got em all lined up…✨like little nazis✨👹👹👹👹
My mum has 6 kids and we arnt in anymeans rich but its very normal for kids to be aggressive
Waiting for the day Supernanny pulls out a straight-jacket and says "Here fight your way out if that, you little shit!" 😂
Maybe it's just the fact I was raised old school as hell but the entire time I've been thinking take a belt to his ass he'll shut up
these kids are from hell....
Why I'm never having kids
I would beat the shit out of the kids
the real question is- Who's sarrah's mother? 🧐🤷‍♂
I love you solo much❤❤
I feel bad for the girl who gave up on getting her moms attention
My respect for this man is so high because when my dad was born, his dad ran off and because of that, my dad went through adoption and he didn’t have a very good childhood so men/boys, listen and learn
Omg my hamsters name is gizmo!!
I agree with was but say you get a girl pregnant if you both are young and can't take care of a baby how about giving the baby to a family that say can't get pregnant
Yup got my tea at half one in the morning
Your dog is so cute
*micheal Jackson mode* HEHE!
my auntys horse is named gizmo
The nanny looks like she tryna stand at ease
5:05 the walking dead kids be like
Just spank them
Nah, we dont need super nanny in South Africa we have colored mothers🤣like if you  South African
And jo frost is dressed like an ikea couch lmao
My middle school gave me a certificate for Perfect Attendance for 1 Quarter- Never had gotten that before, and in middle school, just randomly got that-
At least she has one good child
They are the devils children
IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE!?!!!!!????
It’s always the one that you least expect
the way he jus shouted 'OH THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE T!T, RIGHT IN THE T!T' just got me 😂😂😂😂😂
My mum is so nice but when I was little she would put me on the naughty step and i knew if I was on the naughty step to never go of but I am more responsible now and me and my mum have a great relationship
No wonder your dog is so sad u watered it!
i agree with the stern mum
My mum is Italian, she would chase us around the house with a wooden spoon, you can imagine how that went for us
I wish he said this stuff to my father before he left
when will she find out about the orphanage??
This was the first video I clicked on after watching a ghost hunt of Daz's...... So wholesome...
Daz understands being a parent and he is being like very truthful
Bro i called ma dad an idiot when i was little by accident and he gave me that look 😂😂
How do you pick your nose?
The way he wasn't nervous about talking about sex
Reasons why I was not a spiteful child: I was mildly abused and heavily neglected so I was just happy when I got adopted
This  dude is funny af
If I was a nanny I would come to this house and say fuck you to all the children😂😂😂
6:43 that whole  convocation was so accurate couldn't of been said better
2:02 did he just say all lined up like little Nazis
0:00 is funny
He’s so respectful and understand but can make content. This is the person I aspire to be.
Damm. If.  I did that ill be asking upon the floor but if i was that mother I’d eat the shit out of those kids
if i did that to my mum id be dead before i could even try to attack
I had the c-word virus and you just brightened my literally tasteless time
“like a curtain”
The solution to this problem: 🤜🙍‍♂️
Watching dazed while high is amazing 😛🌿💚
Now if they were black him would have been smacked
Your honour I drop kicked that child in self defence
I would've beat the shit out of those kids.
New lesson learned.... RUN OF.
John get the belt time to beet the kids
Single? I thought you dated someone?
if I pulled this shit with my mom I wouldn't be here commenting, I feel for this mom she doesn't deserve this
She's  a  single  mum
She's a  single  mum
Gizmo Aww 🤣

"it's like spiderman, except she was bitten by another mum" - Daz Games 2021

12:53 I thought she was gonna throw the kid in the water....
If that was me my family would woop then talk. 😬
I'm sitting behind my screen like who hits their mother they want shooting them kids do
My mom did the same with bitinh
His dad is spiderman but he is no wsy home
That thumbnail is on point!
1. Try be good 2. Doesn't work 3. RELOCATE HER FUCKING JAW
When the 4 year old stands up on the table and screams it makes me think of Naruto lol 😂
The naughty spot?? I had the naughty corner
The mom : CALL THE DAMN PREIST AGIAN
Daz once said ‘right in the tit in the tit’😭😭😭
PARTY IN DAZES
the dazzling king of vine daz  and his tired dazzling prince gizmo

DAZ HAS A DAUGHTER?!?!? well u learn something new every day
I would say "SHUT UP RIGHT NOW OR IM TAKING YOU TO THE ADOPTION CENTER"
I really love this man because he is my favourite to watch it
Ull get my booooooot
Shinyest shoe
BITTEN BY ANOTHER MUM 😂🤣😂🤣🤣 MUM SENSES I FRICKEN LOST IT 😂🤣😂🤣🤣
I would beat the sht out of these kids if I was they’re mom
I’d had my butt red as it could get if I’d acted like any of those kids.
11:29 man said kiss my Wiley
if i talked to my mom that way she'd yeet me to the moon with a single slap
Why does his dog has his eyes looking in opposite directions
‘“KEES MA WILLY” HGUSGHBSI
I know for well that if I swore or even said a bad word to wards my mum my dad would chase me across the world and wrestle me to an inch of my life let alone punch or fight them
My ass would have thrown the damn boy
Geez I was wearing head phones my ears are dying
Ok if I swore at my mum I'd be fucked
I bit my mom once…she bit me back…I never bit again. I’m a only child and I wanna say I was raised very very good
Is that dog boston terrier
Not Daz being the dad I never had😅
Your dog is amazing keep making great content!!!!!!! Sending millions of laughs and hugs 🤗🤟🤟
Every African/Latina parent is watching like:0  :0
Heard blue is best color to wear on camera. JonBenet Ramsey's mother use to always have a blue dress with her at all times, in case they found the person who killed her daughter. Because it was said it is most flattering on camera. Not sure if that is still true or not. Pasty her mother passed away in 2006 (which is the year I graduated) but a lot had changed since then.
Omg he’s adorable but i bet he’s the worst one 😂😂😂 that got me so hard
If I did that I would get smack in an other universe 😂😂
Super nanny didn’t do shit
hey daz love your vids
I love you dog I wish I could have him🥺
I think I know where the kids language comes from. I think maybe the dad was a drunk, or just violent which explains where the violence in the kids and the language came from, it's really sad.
Bro I love you’re vids
Something that helps is when your kids get you so stressed you cry. It feels horrible but it stops them instantly. Worked every time with me. I mean they start up again in the next hour but it stops them for a bit
I mean if you want the kids to stop then talk it out if this bad behavior continues grab the chancla if not a broom
Your dog is a jojo reference
😂
My mum used to put me in a corner to sit and she would sit and watch that I didn't leave
Soeey but im 10 minuites into this video and hes only watched 30 SECONDS!?!?!?!?
His reaction are hilarious
I laughed when the kid went shut up and the mum just went no like that’s what I would do if my kid told me to shut up
Whenever I did something bad as a little kid I would be put in a corner and however old I was that’s how many minutes I would stay there, I was not a loud to look away from the corner/speak for those minutes and if I did a minute was added😂😂
Literally my mom with me and my 3 siblings but not attacking her and cussing her out
My dogs name is Gizmo
Daz said something about the Conjuring and I paused the video and watched the Conjuring, thanks Daz🦋🦋
6:35 =)
Does anyone else realise he did this over Sandwich
I was disciplined as a child.       I’m now 17 and I condone disciplining a child regardless of age 👍👍👍
Why didn’t she use the slippers
Daz your right it is hard to be a single mum and it stressful but I am impressed that he is still standing strong and not giving up I also love how you walk about us as women thank you ☺️
nobody: daz saying '' omg some kids gonna get drop-kicked across the floor'' without knowing its going to be a famous line.
You dazz has iggy
I was a little shit when I was that age not nearly as bad but when I was that age my dad counted to three and multiple times died of a panic attack but when I got older I didn't care and he actually hit me and it sorted me out thank you dad
Dad you are the funniest and you are the best
Your dog is very cute but I have a dog called Dobby
daz can you do a part 2 so we can see if the nanny fixed them
Damn if I acted like this i would get beat one time I argued with my brother and she tied me with a rope to him for an hour
if my kid ever bit me when they were 3 or older ill drop kick them
Jake Paul aint got nothing on this kid
Amarica-stop child abuse. England-stop no mother abuse
Daz is like your best friend that you just pick back up where you left off with
Cute doggo
HOLY SHIT YOUTUBE THEM SELFS COMMENTED
dropkick the children, simple. or slap the absolute shit out of them.
Fighting back isn't child abuse, it's self defense in this case
My dogs also called gizmo but he is big and biting
Nekele terami ka ysh mitān tenkangtam
I’d just put the 2 “feisty” children up for adoption and keep the good child

No if I flipped my mum off she would bloody naruto run and hit me back to 1960
At the beginning those kids were doing some tag teaming
I love your last of us poster in the backround.  you should make a series of you playing last of us two
Me having these kids  Oh Hell No
Kids learn from what they hear from their parents very often while young. So it's very likely the mother or father doing/saying the stuff their kids are doing, sometimes its not the case but when its specific or a 4 yo tells their mother diff cuss words and hits her theres no way they didnt learn from their parents.
You know if I did that to my dad I wouldn't get away with it my dad would beat me on the edge of my life if I flipped them off you think your mom is scary you haven't met mine she'll just give me this look and it will literally terrified the s*** out of me because Mom don't mess around you never ever ever flipped them off because it don't end well well yeah I do understand that feeling and I learned I got grounded for two weeks
My dog is called gizmo
This is so so so so so funny
Ohhhh someones gonna kicked across the Living room😶
What the hell is the app daz3d I got an ad for?
A child needs a father figure in its life
That killed me! He or she sold u out …I love dogs ... I have ….a Maltese and a Papillon!
Jesus loves you
Bring out the belt or the wooden spoon.
7:21 The kids got him already
Cute dog
11:25 "kiss my willy"
Are you against abortion?
Comedy gold
Okay I know this sounds horrible but i’d drop kick all of them in a line 1 2 3 drop kick
when you put up your tea and said you hoped I had my tea. I actually was drinking mine lol. You read my mind haha.
Was it just me but I swear the little boy said(suck my willy)in the shops
The thing that got me was my dogs name is Gizmo and his nickname is Giz. And he is the same breed of dog as yours😂👌
😂😂😂😂😂 he’s so fucking funny
A belt  And  A wooden spoon wouldn't hurt
Bro I shit u not I just spit my water out all over my desk
My dad didn't leave me my mom did
Aww that's so cute the start I actually have a cat called gizmo
Also very scary
Thus was a interesting experience
Couldn't the mom hit the kid and lock all or Reece in a locked room? Lmao
"a full time mom and a punching bag" got me 🤣🤣🤣
Nobody: Daz: She's got them all lined up... like little Nazis
Daz you need to make more suppernanny videos they are great!!
i would punt kick all of them
Good guy daz looking out for the younger audience out there
But isn't the camera man making it worse
Wait. Only punished two weeks for flipping the bird? I get punished for a month for trying to defend myself in an argument with my parents. Like, I saw one word and bam. Punishment.
Wate you have a kid
If any of my older siblings did that when they were younger into the corner you go
My parents didn’t use a naughty spot or step but they did tell me to go into a room,for example the kitchen and tell me to make myself something to calm down and then come out and apologise
At least my shoes are dazzling😂👞
Watch dance mom's
Which dand mums
Daz could of picked any name for a dog nope fucking gizz
Laughed all night
7:10 I give my kids a month till their dead
Daz is the best human in the world he should be a therapist
5:05 when luffy has no meat to eat
Some kids do need a slap
5:25 i used to bite my mom when i was a baby but the she bit me and i stopped biting her
Cheese 👍🏻
My dad bit me when I was a child
69!!!!
Ye
You know it’s gonna be a good video when it starts of with Gizmo trying to steal your fans 🤣✨
4:43 HAHHAHAHA A CURTAIN
giz is so cute
I bet when the kids are impossible to deal with they get sent to scared straight
5:20 - 5:33 Can confirm haha My brother used to do the same to one of his friends and my mom bit him and he stopped SO QUICK haha
Wait it has been a hot minute does is still dateing that one girl?
Man my arab mom doesn't give this look she uses the belt
I... just don't take this as my defacto reasoning, but... This made me want to punch that kid. I just... don't want kids. And knowing my course in life, I don't have the risk of making a kid.
More gizmo!!!!!
Is 4 to old for an abortion 🤔
I would've got whooped with a belt
Daz bites his sister, cancel party when?
Ur dog is a JoJo reference
Thank you daz for not saying that girls should only be fully responsible for the child and thanks for not saying that it is fully the girls fault; as a woman, though I haven’t had a child, I see many my age and some younger than get fully nailed to the wall if they have a kid but the male partner doesn’t get any judgement and is given leeway. This mother is trying her best for her kids, she loves them so much that even if they hit or scream at her, she chooses to not walk away from them.
💚🎄
my ears are bleeding
when I was little if I got off the naughty step my dad would slap me across the face than proceed to hit me a spatuler
Kinda funny, my names Reece but I was the complete opposite of that kid
Daz: I know you're trying to steal my followers Gizmo Gizmo: 👁️ 👄 👁️
Sometimes, kids just need to be popped in the mouth
Whenever i behaved bad my aunt would lock me in the room for some hours
I remember my dad put me on the naughty step for hitting my head on a wall on accident. I was *3.* My mum kept telling me she would kill herself and all her alcohol problems were my fault when I whacked her in the face lightly. I was 10, had anger issues (which my mum knew about) and wasn’t in a good state of mind.  Ok now after re-evaluating my childhood I understand why I have a couple problems.
IS THAT IGGY
Well some kids getting dropped kicked around the living room
"Yes I am that lonely single man with a dog" you're single now? Sorry Daz😔 it could be for the better though
Objective; Tantrum
I would have me slapped right on the fuckin spot
Why hasn’t she spanked them for their rude aditude, I don’t care if people think it’s child abuse IT’S NOT this is what happens if you don’t punish your rude children
I watch every add in his vids he really makes my day I enjoy his content so much he’s the only person I watch now
I-is that a jojo referance
Highy.    Nigh
Banazing
Epic
The dog acts like a cat
2 minutes in and im dying of laughter
i`m a old fan
I'm watching this at 12 am and eating my pillow so my mum doesn't hear me laugh
If Reece was my child the teacher would be calling asking if I was abusing my child.
LOCK HIM IN HIS ROOM
Awwww dogo
If the 4 year old boy Had my mom as his mom he would’ve got his ass beat up or even going to the hospital
I thought he was gonna say little prisoners but he said like little nazis 😂😂😂
Kids don’t realise that parents can pick them up and drop kick them.
4:09 I didn’t know that Namco was already making new fighters for Tekken 8
"oh my god somebodies about to get dropkicked across the room" made me laugh my eyes out
BLO- DY JE- SUS

“SHUT UP AND FVCK OFF U BASTARD" HAD ME GOING CRAZY
the mum should have RKOed them
Ironically Daz has a totally normal dad reaction. Boot to ass
My mum was a wooden spoon collector definitely not for cooking 😂
i never got a chance to be violent , nauty yes cuz i was always in my own world.but i can just look at someone wrong and my dad would be the shit out of me,but thanks to him im almost who i wanna be .
cool chameleon daz.
What happend to Linda?
Daz If I did this…let’s just say I wouldn’t be around
7:13 it was a dart
Yo is that iggy?
Gizmo already stole all of your followers man you gave him too much power
I just Love watching Daz programs. You are so funny Daz 😂😂😂😂😂
Someone give her the belt
What we find effective when our kids are naughty a weakeness in them being without thier Phones and the fact we can turn the phones off using a app installed on our phone works brilliantly
The Latina mother in me is SCREAMING!🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴
If I had a kid and they were acting like that I would smack them
This is the longest condom advert I’ve ever watched
The naughty step was god for me cause I just  fell asleep on it
YB by gizmo…….HII DAZLERZ
My Tunisian genes are crying
“Some kids gonna get drop kicked across the living room” 😂😂😂
I just want to hug daz🥺
I watched that dog on tic tok have a mental breakdown on the bed lol
i’m in geometry class and i’m trying so hard to not laugh
To discipline a child just swear at them and hang them upside down for five seconds
All you need ti
If I was the mum I would kick them out I really would not care
The look🤣
Did youtube update something why does it have to go through one person comment?
CUTE DOG
how tf did daz turn a 2 min video into 15 minutes?
Lol “she has them all lined up… like little Nazis” I can’t 😂
it was called timeout for me not the naughty spot
Watch kitchen nightmares
The dogs just not having it
As Travis Scott one time said “belt”

Its the «ooooh my god, some kids are gonna get dropkicked across the livingroom» for me😂
LoL my mum dus that and it is so funny 😂
If I had a child I would just leave the kid to get all the anger out
go to 11 28 the kid says "kiss my willy" im DEAD
I mean it’s not to late to get an abortion
not our dogs having the same name daz
I genuinely got scared when u were imitating a mother
Ur dog looks like iggy
For anyone who watches South Park… I’m convinced that Daz Black is Eric Cartman as a child. 10:40 confirms it 😂
gizmo is so adorable he looks like my boston terrier :D
Gizmo is so cute
I like how daz is talking to the dog and the dog looks like he is on some good shit
7:52 was just funny
About 3 minutes in and I already don’t want kids
7 million !!!
My mum did the exact same thing I but my sister and it made her cry so my mum came up to me and bit me as well it was hard so it would make me realise that it hurts but not to injure me
One little belt would clean this problem up
Did anyone have the membo to wear BLUE  I died XD
No way that little boy told his mom to kiss his Willy. 11 minutes and 30 seconds
There's an episode of super nanny where a small child not a toddler "STANDS AND PEES IN A STORE" and the parents are like fine let's go home then
Ware is stacy
I SWEAR my mum and Daz would be perfect together 😭
If I was that mum I'd sign him up for adoption if he carry on doing that for 2-4 years
Wen I’m angry with my mum I take a fork or a dish and watch her slowly go crazy wen she no longer can find a fork to eat with or a cup to drink from
When I would say a bad word she will pick me up tern on the bath on freasing and toss me in
What the hell
Daz: Did someone send a memo there all wearing BLUE😂😂😂
Iggy from jjba 0:17
I went to the naughty spot in yr. 6, I was accused of air dropping someone something. next  minute hear the teacher swearing at me to go put my name on the chart.. I spent the whole lunch in the office sitting on the floor facing a wall for a hour. whilst talking to the kid that's across from me that's also in the naughty spot
Use the belt or the whip
Joe mama
Bro I remember when you did that vine holy crap that’s hilarious
sees dog- likes video immediately-
And this is why I don’t understand why people want to be parents 😭😂
My mum was a private tutor (aka her job was to teach a subject NOT be a nanny - I swr some parents just dropped their kids off thinking it’s daycare). And there was that one kid that would not listen to anything. He was very violent, the moment my mum would ask to read something he would start yelling. It would take three people to even get him to just be still. The mother (who honestly was weird herself and was also a single mother) couldn’t even control him and it was like the kid was controlling the mum (I’m sure he has some kind of issue but his mother never did anything abt it/take him to the doctor)  That 4 yr old reminded me of him (even tho that kid was much older). But yh it just comes down to parenting, and a lot of parents don’t know how to control/parent kids especially when it comes to more difficult kids. The parents’ reaction just enables that behaviour more without them even realising it
My brother used to bite me on my legs/thighs when we were kids and it hurt like hellll  I would show the bruises to my parents and no one did anything lol
i played loads of god of war 2018 and if kratos was there for discipline the kid would be in the ER
I'm a fan
did the kid swear at 7.21
"lined up, like little nazi's" AYOo
'all lined up like little nazis' 😂
Gizmo is cute 🥰
I legit made myself tea for a cold just to be able to say I drink 🍵 tea
"Yes i am that lonely single man with a dog"   Sarah: *What am i, A ROACH?*
LOL I CANT STOP LAUGHING
I remember as a kid if I fell and started crying I would get hit and put in time out if I acted like that I would be dead😅
Omg he's adorable But I bet he's the worst one💀
My dogs name is gizmo after the gremlin
DAZ said moms do 😳😳😳😳
You know my mom once put my FRIEND not her child my FRIEND in a time out chair and I was just sitting there like “I have the coolest mom ever”, to be fair we were at my house so she made the rules but it was the best moment I will never forget
the into tho 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love you guys love you gears
Joe mama 😂
You are great dad relly great you make me feel happy when am sad so thank you
Not
Dad you are a bad youtuber
Daz: "1 episode in and you won't want kids ever". Me: I don't want kids and I've never even  HEARD of Super nanny.
Daz: *Yes, I’m a single Man with a Dog* *5Minutes L4ter*  “ I took My Daughter to The doctor and…* a moment later* , No She’s Only violent to me and her mum*
Gizmo is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee😩🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 what age is he/her but soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee i want him/her he/she is soooooo cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee it’s a cutie pieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Kid: hits mum  Daz: she probably wants attention by relocating her jaw
Kid shouts nothing: Daz: you’ll get that and my BOOOOT

8:03 Don’t mind me just marking the truest and funniest part of the video
So funny
Yes I am that lonely single man with a dog I LOVE THAT
10:40 I had a corner
My dogs name is Gesmo too
Heyyy, it's your cousin, Roman! Let's go bowling, yes?
i would accidentaly step on my moms foot and she would be like "oh so you have choses.... *DEATH*
Plz watch super nanny again but the niti family
My mom would of beat my ass.but then again I knew better then to act like that
It's a good thing I don't have kids, I would put them in the ground within seconds.
Daz just saying I have got money at all because I’m kinda poor and I really want you merch:<
Its my b day
Love this guy
Love this guy
If daz wanted to be it like he said his name should be super daddy

If a super nanny was Asian okay listen here either u change or ur going to be whipped or locked in the basement for 4 days
That's ok you're super coll
I'm a big fan of your videos. But not the biggest.
My mom would whoop my ass if I even looked at her wrong
There's a lovely thing called chloraform
I'm Hispanic  you know  what my mom would do here a scenario: Hispanic mom: clean your room you pig I didn't raise a pig closes door* me: mouths but accidentally says it loud enough for her to hear HECK YOU MOTHER* Hispanic mom: CON QUIEN CREES QUE HABLAS IDIOTA me minutes later ⚰⚰💀💀☠
"its not like she can afford a nanny"           Supernanny: *EvApOrAtEs*
10:00 I died omg too funny

Jazz stop and never do that to your mother is bad for you
Hi Daz
when did I step into therapy
If i did that to my asian mom she wont feed me- and i'd be sleeping  in the shed
It’s called a belt 😆
Rip xxx🙏🙏
Rip xxx🙏🙏
When my brother was hitting or biting they send him out side give him a stick and tell him to hit a tree
My mom would break my spine if I tried that with her!!😭🤚🏼😞
Daz spittin strait facs
Daz- “THATS NAUGHTY” (pops microphone)
Fav vid from daz yet
U should make  a series of watching super nanny and give parenting tips
OMG I LOVE IT WHEN DOGS HAVE THOES STUPID LOOKING EYES ITS SO FUCKING CUUTE
If i was the mom and she tried to rise the power bill, I would just turn off the breaker to her room and lock her in there.
I agree a stern mother is terrifying, however, when your dad is 6 foot 2 and awfully strong, and he's screaming at the top of his lungs, I'd reckon they scare me alot more. But I love my dad tho, and I certainly have his temper
Bro I don’t drink Tea!
"I've watered you" BAHAHAHAHAH
New segment: daz parents
Me: watching the kids all lined up no problem 😌  Daz: they are all lined up like Nazis Me: True true
"ive watered you" Daz, you dont use a water can...
"not "be a man" dont say that its not true" daz is a true soul he is so accepting obviosly an amazing dad and we love you
literally the mom could beat the crap  out off him and be like verytime u do that u will get hit
Gizmo (sorry if I spelt it wrong) is SOOOO cute💫✨
Can i just add. This show isnt child safety at all either. They didn’t blur the girls underwear out, supernanny is a sterotype and also she doesn’t actually help they fake it, also 80% of this is the PARENTS fault. If u dont teach ur kids manners from young age they will be horrid. Also if u cant look after kids DONT HAVE THEM iK sometimes u cant help it and yk but U HAVE TO TEACH UR DAMM KIDSSSS   (Ps: im not saying its the moms fault ik she’s struggling and the same happened to my aunt ik how hard being a mother is and they deserve all the respect but seriously tho, shes an amazing person for putting up with it but u have to teach them.
It’s all fun in games untill the light breaks
I am one of six children in my family🤠🤠
OhOhOh my god some kids about to get drop kicked across the living room😂😂😂😂🤣😂
Respect for this mom if my kids did this I would beat the piss out of them
I’m a single mom and I raised my girl completely solo. Thank you for not stigmatizing this important role. I was lucky to have supportive friends and a challenging kid who made parenting an adventure!  The  mum in this episode is completely overwhelmed. I hope super nanny was able to help! ❤️😊🙏🏻
I didn't know you had a daughter
2:03 like little nazi’s
First of all the kid is posessed,second of all they don't know what's living in Brazil if u dare to punch your mum she would just kill u
One punishment given to me by mother was to sit on the couch for 6 hours for complaining that I don’t feel like going to the shop and that I didn’t feel like moving.
"some kids gonna get drop kicked across the living room"
She got them all lined up like natsies
I can stop laughing my mom was like……………..wtf 👁👄👁
Mad respect for when he taught the boys not to leave but to support the mother and child. i appreciate it man 📈📈📈
"she's got them all lined up" "-like little Nazis"  golden
daz is that one person who just says everything correct, you cant ever say he’s wrong.
I know a lot of people don’t agree with discipline but they all need a good ass whooping and sent to their room with no electronics and grounded and I bet they would have stopped acting like that When I was a kid if I popped off at my momma wrong she would take everything out our room but our dresser and bed and we would learn real quick not to be disrespectful, a lot of people now call that abuse but I definitely don’t feel like that was abuse she was just teaching us not to act like that and she told us all the time that in the real world acting like that someone would come along bigger and badder than we were and beat us down, and she was right. There’s always someone out there that can beat your ass I much preferred an ass whooping from my mom who loves me and is trying to teach me than from someone who is tired of the bullshit you do. It’s a good lesson to learn at a young age, imagine those kids went and did that to someone that wasn’t so forgiving? They could get hurt badly. It’s a better lesson taught from someone who loves you.
“25 consecutive life sentences” 😂😂
About the blue thing.. I look like a smurf when im off to school. My pants are blue, my jacket is blue and backpack is blue💀
If I tried to hit my mom I think I would be dead rn HAHA
OMG DAZ YOUR DOG IS SO CUTE HIS EYES ARE SO MASSIVE I LOVE HIM PLZ PUT HIM MORE VIDEOS
I wish I had a father like u.🥺 Mine was never around.
when u said that dont leave the mother alone with the children well there has been girls that say they took their pill and so they are safe but they are not so they basically trick you. If that happens to me and i am young i would not take care of the children it is not my responsibility bc she lied and that is illegal. Idc if people say you still have to take care of the child.
@dazgames when you said in this video “Ive got my tea, I hope you do as well” I paused this video to make my tea and come back and then I went to watch it again. P.S. I love your videos🤍💙
1 min into the video and I’m already choking on my food from laughter 🥲 lovely
Go to 11:28 in the video
😂 daz is so funny like I am peeing meh self
hi
the children reminds me of how my little brother is. he screams and has tantrums a lot, and when he's grumpy he yells like crazy. the reason he does it is because he gets attention, every time he's screaming and yelling my parents give him a phone, tablet or even computer and then let him watch whatever he wants. like wtf why are you rewarding him for being horrible? why are you blaming it on me that he barely has any friends and he's behind in school because he's not smart enough to speak properly like his classmates? it's not my fault, it's yours.
You look like and sound like the main character from after life on Netflix
Some episodes of super nanny are just amazing condom adds
That’s why people invented floggings I guess
You r the best in the world
ITS IGGY
Super nanny more like super idol

If I was a mom like that without a boyfriend I would get a really scary boyfriend
i am so thankful my boyfriend is by myside. like i am already stressed enough with working and being prego and having alot of things to do at work before the baby is even born and the fact he is still by myside i am more than blessed. i know its not going to be easy just the two of us with no help but i think we got this.
Omg daz while waching this im drinking coke and then the kid stands on the bloody table and daz says omg the kid is going super saiyen (sos Idk how to spell it)and I start choking on the bloody coke im drinking🤣🤣🤣
As an 18 year old kid who is expecting a baby in 8 months I hope my kid doesn't act like this cuz I'll smack the shit outta it
I know this is bad if a kid did that to me I’d be like fine they’ll eat when they’re hungry
“wholesome content “ *flash back* *THATS FUCKING FANTA* *OI FUCK UP!* *back* Yea WhOlEsOmE
Your daughter is named Sara?! That's my name too! Your daughter and I are name twins.
11:33 he says touch my willy
Awwwww so cute.
“That’s what she’s thinking I can get attention if I relocate her jaw “😭😭😭
SO THIS IS WHAT ITS FROM
I wouldn’t be put on the naughty spot, my dad would just slap me, it would never work.
To that little boy hell of a shot 😂😂😂
7:46 - 7:55
I never bit or hurt my mom when I was younger 😂😂 I was pretty calm kid tbh
More supernanny please
and my parents think i'm bad...
a other way to know your gonna die is when mums count to 3(btw i let my mum count to 3)
The look inside gizmo's eyes when you told him you were going to put him down made me feel like he was saying as soon as you put me down I'm shitting in your shoes love you dazz
Let me introduce you to my dads best friend…. The belt….. from personal perspective it works wonders 🥲😌😮‍💨
BROO that is so true, I remember growing up my mum was so nice, really carefree with a lot of stuff I wanted to do. BUT, the scariest moments are when she just looks, bro I swear I saw my life flash before my eyes
man.. super nanny brings back many memories of when i was in elementary school. me and my grandmother would always watch at least an episode or 2 before im off.
Hi

I love frenchies are so cute
if I did this my dad would have killed me littarely
"AAHHH HE'S BITING!!!" -Daz Games Best quote of the century
I have a ferret named gizmo
YOU WILL ALSO GET MY BOOT best line
Being a single parent must be hard but I’m just saying I turned ok because of discipline. You don’t even have to do it a lot you just need to do it so they become afraid of it then they will be afraid of being an asshole
Roses are red  Violets are lame  Daz has no disc space  And Linda is to  Blame
I’m sorry I’m a menace of Society I don’t like tea
My mum would simply backhand me on the head if I even swore at her nvm beat her
We had the naughty step and it was the bottom step of our stairs. So my youngest brother would refuse to walk on the bottom step because he didn’t want to be naughty 😂
14:36 did u see mr. fly
"shes a full time mom and punching bag" AAHAHA
Seeing Jo makes me think of that South Park episode where Cartman sent her to the insane asylum lmao! 😂
you do indeed get a certificate for anyting nowadays, i got one fore leaving a school
Daz: shortened sentence or freedom 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I only had to look at my children and not once did my children ever back chat,  me or put their hands on me, she’s arguing like she’s one of their mates at school, I put my daughter on the naughty step one time, and I walked through to the kitchen and she was sat there with a Capri Sun a packet of quavers and her Game Boy, she had been sending her little brothers for stuff, she was in so much trouble but to this day I laugh when I think about it x
when he did the mom look i immediately sat up straighter even though he's literally a man and in my computer screen
if that 4 year old bit me id say here come the f22 fighter jet- punches the shit out of him
I’m not a fan anymore, I’m a whole ass air conditioner
Remember when he first got him and he was a puppy i think his name was gizmo
Bloody hell daz you got me watching mrs doubtfire for the 79th time
Hello
9:8 I know that look
This man is too funny
If I did that to my mother I would be dead I also remember my mom telling me to leave the corner and I would be lost in my own little world by that point
My sister acted a tiny bit like Shannon and i mean you would think my sister was the nicest kid compared to her, sure she would take herself to her room but slam her door loudly, she did it enough that our parents took her door off. she didn't slam her door again.
This is why you should give them a good smack they’ll never forget they’ll figure it out then
✨wholesome content✨
Man i need to meet daz  PLEASE I LOVE UR VIDS THEY MAKE ME CRACK UP SO HARD i need ur vids
“Oh my god some child is about to get drop kicked” killed me😂😂
my brother once (ONCE) gave my greek grandmother a attitude. Called her a bitch. He got to suck on a soapy sponge for that one... 😂
little kids dress up blue because there crips LOL
I don't think the nanny even did anything
11:27 kisth mah wiileh
My mum used the pig thing on me
my mum told me if i moved from the naughty step a giant spider would eat me😂
The day I missed this was bad timing and he jsut said “oh my god he’s gonna get dropped kick cross the living room”
if i made my mum cry i would literally feel awful, but those little hell demons didnt even care 💀
9:51 that child rage quits life
Gonna say this right now. If me or my brother had ever acted out the way that four old did, we would have had our shit kicked in. Our parents aren't the strictness people but there are many things that we weren't allowed to do and acting like that at any point was one of them.
Daz we could take into consideration that the mum is abusing the child and she acting like she don’t for tv
That kid woke up with an attitude😅
Im a Rich ass monke
Bless YOUR heart Daz, you really are a sweet and thoughful man
10% video 90% talking
Hear me out, handcuff all the kids together and if 1 goes for you you can just fling 1 away and they'll all go XD
Bear hug the 4yro and don't let him go until he apologises XD
Your not wrong
"If a prisoner is shanking someone you don't walk up to someone and say SHORTEN SENTENCED OR FREEDOM" that killed me
His mom :🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴🩴
"Its not being a man, i think its a toxic saying... Be a man is no such thing, BUT be responsible" THAT IS  LIFE LESSON THERE
If that was me my mom would SLAP THE SHIT OUT OF ME😂😂. For real though I would be in a nother fucking demention
poor mom :( i hope everything is well nowadays
Just give them a super nut tap lol
That's the killer mom stare
“And Joe is dressed like an IKEA sofa,” 😂😂😂😂
0:42 “vesauce Dax here let’s talk about birth control”
I love how all the kids are killing the mom and the 8 year old and super nanny are just watching them like.😐🤨
You’ve heard it here first a boy that swears more than Daz which is rare
The 4 yr old if f-ing super super satan  Actually all the kids are super super satan
Matilda vibes
I would love to see Daz reacting to full episodes of Supernanny, especially the American ones. It'd be awesome.
All I needed was to see the dog, instantly pressed the like button
Oh yes we hit 7 mil lol didn’t notice
I'm here for Gizmo 😍 He looks like a crossedeyed bat and it's freaking adorable 😍😍😍
Tbh my mum probably needed super nanny when dealing with me. I was always the violent and temper tantrum sibling. I would pull on my hair and now its damaged. I would hate my dad for so many years, I would punch, cry scream. She told me of a story about when she nearly put me up for adoption. And I don't think she was joking-
If I behaved like this i would be digging my own grave
I’d drop kick them
Shortened sentence or freedom 😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂
“She’s a full time mom, and punching bag! It-it’s stressful
U wanna know the reason she named the kid Reese it’s by it’s short for Reese‘s and Reese’s  slogan is sorry not sorry
This is why I would not be a good parent... I would slap that 4 year old so fast he wouldn't know what hit him.... Id bite him back.... I have no patients
THE DOG IS A JOJO REFERENCE
Daz: they are all lined up, like little nazis  That killed me
I’m deaf and I watch this guy out of the sub titles and it is still funny 😆😆😆😆
8:38 the fact I do the exact same thing daz did like I think everyone’s going to flip their mum off and mock them at least once 😭
Is that a french bull dog because I have 2!
We love u daz
No but when your mum looks at you like that and you try to laugh it off and they go “it’s not funny.” And your like shit. Anyone else?
OR YOUR GOING THE ADOPTION SENTER
If he was my children I will scream "GET YOUR AS OF THE FING TABLE O"
UNODOPT THEM ITS NOT THAT HARD
Just drop kick them 😂
I tell you what really annoys me about jo is when she says “its unasseptable” I just  get really pissed off when she says that it’s unacceptable for gods sake
If I slapped one my family like that I would have been back handed INTO the floor my family don’t take that crap make you learn real quick XD
Daz is wrong there's nothing scary're then a Mexican mother
Jizmo
If I did that to my mum I’d be sleeping out side for the next month with a ass as red as a baboons ass.
whats hoovering
Parent tip; Open palm=abuse Back hand=discipline
Look at Joe just sitting in the corner like a little curtain👱🏼‍♀️
My school gave me certificate for podcast for showing a $30 Amazon microphone once I get no smart certificate just for having a ok mic
4:42 "look at joe just standing there, she's like a curtain." -Daz 2021
Did anyone hear when the boy said 'kiss my willy' at 11:28
O
My rabbit is called gizmo
I loved how he flipped us off in the thumbnail 😂
"Oh my god these kids are satan"
If I did this to my parents I would have been put up for adoption
I want your dog it so cute
I love or videos
I like the fact he's probably the only youtuber who England
Ngl I would’ve slapped them hard as soon as they started any of that 😭
omg Ur dog is so sweet
Daz they should be a tag team in mma
Daz, I respect you so much. More and more, you show me that there are good people to admire in the world. So, thank you
OH,YEAH!That kid is getting thrown across the room!
White parents: Stop hitting me!!  White kids: *hits anyway*  Me: *me confused as hell why the mom didn’t bring out the belt, because I had Mexican parents.*  👁👄👁
The cutest damn dog lol i love him
Yous the belt
wwe
I love you I find you so funny but I get what you’re saying too it’s understandable you’re right 😂😂😂😂😘😘😘😘😉😉😉😉
what episode is this?
I haven't laughed this hard in a while thanks Dazz 🤣🤣😁😁
When he shouted that's naughty it sounded like a meme
OH mY gOd thEsE kiDs aRe SaTan!!!!!
My parents would make my brothers and I hold hands whilst putting our heads on the walls for hours if we were rude. 🥲
I am violent now ever since I was two I’ve been biting kicking punching slapping yesterday I punched a teacher in the mouth
I bite everyone
Also the little kid is grabbing the handbag go back and check on telling you that is🙂🙂🤣🤣
When the kid said ''you can kiss my willy'' I nearly spat my drink 😂😂😂😂
i said to my mum i hated her and she'd spank me to space
Ok literally I'm an Italian I'm from Italy my Mamma would literally withe beat my ass or just do that look and say run
2:04 I’m sorry what did you say
No gizmo looks like iggy (jojo sdc)
Ik hitting and punishing isn’t the best way to parent, but like a Daz said his mom bit him back and he never but someone again. If that boys mom smacked or bit him one day I guarantee he wouldn’t do it again.

you're dog looks like iggy form jojo lol
I swear to god, if this woman don't grab the child, and whoop his a-
0:18 "I watered u"
I have tea
"Everytime you have sex, a baby can always happen" Cis gay people: 😱 Post-op trans people: 😱
The idea of punishing the kids with the same way they hurt each other (though obviously dialed back) is honestly the best method. My mum bit her brother once, and my nan lightly bit her on the thumb, she never bit again. Her brother was an absolute demon and never got punished at all, he's still a horrid person.  Moral of the story: bite your children. For their own good.
Super nanny just standing and looking not caring whilst she actually is
That cat at the start said:oh my god the sky is alive  Also when I hit my parents my hand would be grabbed and what felt like crushed and I wasn’t spanked much but if my dad was gonna do it I’d start planing my funeral cuz he hurt but I love my parents they love me and that’s all that matters really
3:16 does daz have a child?
I JUST LOSE IT WHEN THE KID STANDS ON THE TABLE AND SCREAMS😂😂😂
I would’ve slapped the actual hell out of that 4 year old but that’s just me I’ll let the mom be doing her stuff.
If I did any of that to my mom she would have back handed the taste out of my mouth 😂
Not me looking at the thumbnail and loosing it already
my mum did the same thing about the biting  after she did it I NEVER EVER bothered AGAIN
Daz: Oh My god the kids about to get kicked across the living room    Me: Its not gonna be a living room anymore
I hit my mom once. Once. My butt is still sore from that whooping.
I am 13 and when my stepmom says “go to your room!” I’ll see you back  “okay I like being my room” I just think it’s funny because it’s not really a threat anymore it’s a relief
Get a Mexican mom they solve everything
You can see the terror in daz face when he's telling the story 🤣🤣
Me stilling getting recommended Daz Vines
😃😂
9:15 you know when a mom gives you that look you better be right with Jesus cause your about to meet him
That happened to me I bit my sister then my mum did the same to me and I never did it again 😂
She is sitting the like a curten when the child was hitting the mom
With the dog single
Daz: yes I’m the man
While watching this I was just thinking about the things said from the show and Daz and I just thought TF! I was never like that are you all phycopaths
Hi
[YUMMY)
You should do a video which is getting gizmo his own channel
Yea that's Defo a irish family
You always get me in fits of laughter with the things you say! Don’t ever change 😉
if you give gismo a channel im done i will be happy
OHHHH YOUR DOG IS SO CUTE AND GIZMO IS THE PERFECT NAME! How have I never seen him before? I have been a fan for over 5 years!
your not wrong it happens to me to dazz
the Dog is more cross eyed than  cross eyed😂
DAZ u should watch a full episode
9:18 idk about you but my mom slightly turned her body just a little, and let me tell you I have never in all my years cleaned my room so quickly.
Me : Do you ever wonder whats going on in someone's head. Dogs head: Baby shark dododo baby shark dododo
The dad thing is why I firmly believe in waiting to have a child till you get married. When you marry, its (supposed) to be a commitment to that person, to always be there. While I fully understand getting heated in the moment and doing it, I still think that it should wait till youve at least made sure you want to be a permanent part of their life. Child or no.
Put that kid in an MMA ring. I couldn't breath.🤣🤣🤣
Lol “ little nazis”
Daz my mom did the exact same thing, i bit my sister so my mom bit me on the arm and i never bit anyone ever again
I'm just saying if dazes kid bit him he would R.K.O that kid and then throw her out the window
OMG SUPER NANNY  FUDEING HELP THE MUM OMG
You have a kid?
My dogs name is Gizmo aswell, I call him Giz/Gizzy!
Daz you make me laugh all the time 😂 😂
Like little nazis
My mom was a single mother and if I talked back she back hand me I'm grown now but one day when I was 16 I thought I was gonna be tough and talk down to her till she hit me with a left hook
7:46 where tiktok trends came from   Part.1 😹😹😹😹
Our dogs have the same collars
i still dont know how daz is single tbh i would date daz he makes me laugh and hapy unlike most 21 year olds do (eye roll)
I was a biter….I bit my cousin, my brother, my mam and dad…..just loved it 🤣🤣🤣
As a young man, (who had amazing parents,) watching this just absolutely INFURIATES me. That boy needs to be put into a corner for a few hours. YES, I said a few hours. No name calling, no remarks, just make him sit there and stare him down.  Clearly physical violence is his go to, so by putting him in the corner, he isn’t hitting anyone. Show him you mean what you say, and stick with it. Getting more violent? Take away everything that he likes. No dinner, no ice cream, no chicken nuggies, no video games, tablet, toys, what have you… he needs to learn: “There are no rewards for bad behavior.”   Being patient and standing your ground is key. YOUR the parent. YOUR the top of the household. YOU don’t answer to anyone… especially your kids. And absolutely NO violence, because violence doesn’t solve anything. In fact it makes it worse, because there’s no lesson to be taught.
thank you for addressing men in this video, I appreciate how you said " be responsible" instead of be a man, because often times when a child is brought into the equation boys think that just providing a check is enough for the baby, but its not about money alone, being a parent requires both parties to be present and put their child first no matter what. In America is common for the guy to leave and think that child support is enough to provide for a baby but its a struggle maintaining work,social life, school if possible, and being there for your child.
If my " dad " watched this and lesson to daz saying to stay with the child or whatever he would regret leaving me
if I did any of those as a kid I was locked in the washroom with the lights off.........I was terrified of the dark and couldn’t reach the light switch.
"I SHOULD BE SUPER NANNY!! Pull my hair back and put me in blue, NOW!"   I absolutely lost it, LMAO!! 🤣 🤣
some children don't need a nanny. they need an exorcist.
OUR DOGS HAVE THE SAME NAME
I thought the 4 year old said fuck but i was like "surely not... surely a 4 year olds not yelling fuck"  No hate to the mum as well. As Daz said she could be single and struggling
My gueny pig is called gizmo
BRO, HE HAS A BOSTON?! As a literal Boston ENTHUSIAST, this is monumental
Watch the new season it is so good!
THE DOG THO ❤️
When he said the kids gonna get dropped kicked 😂
I was so stupid when I was little when I was mad at my parents I turned the tap on full thinking it would make them mad but they never noticed it 😂
I find it funny that i got BC the day before i watched this video.. im crying
Anyone else's mom threatened to break there teeth out with a hammer if you bite someone again... Just me?
can she like pay someone to bully her kid? or like pay someone to whack the kid?
She got em lined up     Like little nazis
Y’all might be different but if I did any of that I would have been thrown through a wall
is it just me who’s the favourite kid as middle child?
I would just drop them in the river bye !
was that a nappy
Silent angry moms are scary…. One time in Walmart I was probably 5 or 6 I wanted a tin of Pokémon cards and I can’t remember how most of it goes but the thing I do remember is. “Keep it up well be alone in the car soon.” Scared the ever living shit out of me. To this day still scares me.
When I was like 4 my brother bit me so my mom bit him back...I now have a phobia of getting someone biting me and I also bite people to show affection...I have issues 😌
Asian kids could never :D  My mom would be throwing sandals at me
Puppy🐶
You know how dad said he once got a certificate for the most shiny shoes. Nah I got one better I once got a certificate for being to the most annoying kid in class because I would talk a lot and did no work at all and the school gave me certificate that said fore being to most talkative kid 😂
Some people can't have birth control because it could give them blood clots
YouTube  reacted to you😅😅🤣🤣
My brother  is like that.he is like the hulk and it's not funny 😬😬😱
I love daz 😂
7:50 I DIED OF LAUGHTER
IS THE DOG A JOJO REFRENCE?
I was once put on the stair for kicking the dog, I sat there for 6 hours because I wouldn’t say sorry and refused to do so
MORE THEN PLAYSTATION AND ITS A FLING OUT THE WINDOW
PART 2
I flipped my mom off once when I was a kid and she chased me into the bathroom and broke the door down
“She’s got em all lined up like little nazis”
Get the wooden spoon out
secretly the children are possessed .
Hi GIZ
I watched the first video when he got Gizmo last night
worst punishment my mum gave me: i had to hold a gallon of water with my arms stretched for 1h30min,never got off the line after that
The fact that I have watched dad from his vines to now, and seeing how much he has grown is just amazing I love him so much. He doesn’t know how much he means to so many others(and me lol)
is it just me or does it look like gizmo can see Daz and the other side of the wall. so cute tho!!
hel.o bada fan hu ma
Omg these kids are Devil and then there angel 😈😇
If it's one thing I learned. If you pin a child long enough. They'll eventually get tired. Worked with me. My brother just had to pin my arms down on the floor and keep my legs down and after a bit I just gave up.
I drank tea as I watched this☕🎊
Daz's dog is adorable-
The time He said why is everyone wearing blue my mom came in with blue Powerade
Ahhhhhhh HE’S BITING
Dog
Man we need to get daz a girlfriend
The nanny reminds me of that teacher from Matilda
off topic , but truth is that owners do look like there dogs
My mom would beat me soooooooooo hard
why u wear protection
0:09 sorry but can we agree your dog looks like a Minecraft cow XD
My hispanic genes are screaming right now. Knowing my dad, I would have slept outside in the doghouse if I hit my mom.
When pain
“THATSNAUGHTY “
0:20 thanks for the pfp👌
Another Daz Watches where I was crying laughing at you Daz, you're a deadset bloody legend mate.. I absolutely LOVE Gizmo! If we are already Dazzlers and we love Gizmo... does that make us "Gizzlers"? 😆
I once got an award for neatest and cleanest desk
Daz always makes me smile, Thank you so much😊
Only Daz an turn a 2min video into 15min 🤣
If I did any of this I'd get throw across the living room
If those we’re my kids they wouldn’t be alive
"there is always an option, you will the woman pregnant, so take responsibilty" - Daz you're so right and I love you
*me sat there patiently waiting for the mum to beat the shit out her kid*
* kids all lined up looking neat* one minute later: THERE SATAN SPLIT INTO THREE PARTS
this is why i can’t have kids cos i would punch them in the nose
9:53 I died 💀
I mean i don't have tea but i do have crisps. SO YEAH😃😃😃😃
... And Joe Frost is dressed like an IKEA couch
The first 40sec  that I have watched and I’m dead 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
play finding big foot
Cartman got the better of her in South Park 😂
Love the vid , THANKSSS DAZZZZZZ
“NOTHING” = mini Gordon Ramsey

“PULL MY HAIR BACK AND PUT ME IN BLUE”  ~Daz
Why have parents stopped using belts?
Luv ya buddy:]
3:35 I got one for happies person of the year- I was seriously depressed at the time… and was having mental breakdowns like every five minutes XD
"Blod. Dy. Je. Sus!" 😂😂
7:48 _when Gordon eats a food which is raw_
If I did this as a kid to my mum I would be dead
im so glad my parents disciplined me
thanks  my daughter's father let me down while i was pregnant. he just went out, get drunk, go to partys without me, meets his friends to drink a lot of beer and stuff... he had no responsibility so i was alone even after our daughter was born... after our breakup i was on my own and very scared. and i have to say it is not an easy job to be a single mom... but it is possible. From time to time  a partner by your side would be helpful when he is supported and you share the education but it also works without a man by your side...😅
The bite made me laugh, my older sister bit another kid at daycare because she had been pulling my sister hair. My older brother bit my sister never hatd enought to break skin but still like in her arm legs stomach. Well along comes me and bites the living shit out of my older brother to the point like 15-18 years later he still has scars I even bit his in is face where you can now varly see 2 small scars on the sides of his nose. My yonuger brothe broke the trend and never bit anyone but the broke the trend on a lot of things. It is 6 years between my older sister and older brother then 6 years betwwen me and ny older brother and just 2.5 years between me amd my younger brother. He also wad the only obe mom needed a c-sektion for because the was sick. And he use to sit in almost a perfect split and bang his head in the floor like REALLLY hard wheb he got mad and me and big bro thought it was the funniest shit ever so we teamed up to piss him of. All pictures of him fron when hr learn to sit until like 6 years old he is blue with bumps in his forhead
13:45 wise words from daz
Daz love your videos you have always succeeded in making me laugh like how you say the word blue stuff like that is funny like it’s time for a tea party thank you for making me laugh even when I’m feeling under the weather
Loved your video like always And when I was younger I always watched the Nanny I feel sorry for the woman :( you're words where very well said about being there for the other as parent when you nock somebody up Loved to see my favorite youtuber doing a video from a programe I always watched Thank you
She’s a stressed mom and the kids don’t help her in anyway
"Wholesome content" thank you so much for this
I mean at that point it is kinda the mums fault for telling the kid about swearing
my dog is called gizmo to
A Smack. A GoooD Smack is all they Need
You scared the bejesus out of me
If I behaved like Reese I would already have my grave saying I died from my mom long ass wooping
Don't all mums do that
Your not lonely if you have a dog and 7.0m fans
Bloody hell I’m dying I can’t stop laughing
Me watching this now I want to go too that house and beat the FUCK out of the youngest so the older ones know not to do that I would bring the belt and soap
My mom bit me back
As a kid we did nose and toes....we have to stand against the wall and if our nose came off the wall we got more time or the threat of the belt...that only happened twice( the belt )  but it sure made us learn fast.....Fuck kids today.....if I said any of this soap would be my dinner for the next few days. Mom could just give us a look and we knew to stop
When I was a child I used to lie all the time and one time after keeping a secret diary talking crap about people my mom and dad found out, yeah my dad ignored me for 2 weeks and we had a 2 hour talk of him going “well why did you do it” and I was panicking going “I DOnt KnoW”? He has never been louder and I was panicking
hiyyyyyye
im here for the dog
My dogs name is gizmo too 😂
9:34 nÓ
My cats names gizmo as well
Sorry that boy will have dentures by the age of 5 🤣
Kids aren’t born this difficult. These behaviours are direct consequences of how they’ve been raised. The mother should’ve gotten help a long time ago
My mom made me hold a penny to the wall with my nose and if I drop it 3 more mints
I'm getting parenting tips from daz! Lmmfao! How much you want me to pay you?😂😂😂
Has no one noticed Nick Frost is narrating the video
Sooo cuuuuute 🤦🏻‍♀️🐶💗💗💗💗💗💗
*if i were the mum I wouldnt keep asking ham or jam I'd say fine dont eat, dont want jam or ham dont get nothing.*
i think the dad go get milk
These video’s always make my day
Asian kids watching this be like:
I got a sheild for winning this or that like
your not alone you got us
I've watched a couple of videos now and I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Subscribed!
You know the story Daz told. He bit his sister and then his mom bit him. I have the same story but my dad bit me when I bit my sister then I don't bite anyone.
these kids have it lucky. once i had everything in my room taken away and put in the shed
My name is Joe Joe mama
I love Boston Terrier I have one and my friend has mine a psychopath but my friends two is really sweet. Mine is in need of holy water.
If I tried this with my parents I would never walk again
Just say fuck you back he'll  stop
yooo the dog got dem pigeon eyes whats with the dawg
Anyone else think daz and his dog look like twins
Daz please bring back “LINDA”
Those kids went to my primary school 😂
Wait.... Your single..... But you have a kid wheres your wife did you break
a kid i knew got house points for not biting the table
Super Dazzy
1:45 she IGNORED THE CAT! I never trust people who ignore an animal that wants attention
Omg I would probably get whooped to China if I acted like that 😂
daz when u say its not like she can pay a nanny or smth, that's because she's busy ALWAYS PAYING THE FUCKING ELECTRIC BILL
my mum just BAN MY IPAD LIKE 2 DAYS
POV: you’re either and Arab ,Asian , or a Black American, and watching this was horrifying 😳
I’m literally sick right now, but daz can still make me laugh
4:26 Y U SO FUNNY??
11:31 lol that's exactly it. I work retail, and any time you get into a public forum and start talking about how some parents really do just let their kids get away with red-blooded murder, someone's gotta come crawling out of the woodwork to boohoo about how judgmental you're being because "that child PROBABLY has a CONDITION".   And it's like, no, they probably *don't.* Obviously there are some kids who have developmental issues/conditions that cause them to act out, and it's good to be mindful of that, but the majority of the time it's because they've been taught that they can get away with bad behavior- which is sometimes blatantly obvious from how their parents interact with them.   I once literally watched a mother try to get her openly defiant (idk) 8 year-old son to come over to her, and she did it by staying right where she was and saying "Michael, come over here" about twenty times. Then her husband came over and did the *exact same thing.* I watched two grown adults become frustrated across a span of ten minutes because it didn't occur to either of them to give the instruction *once* and then walk over and do something about it when he ignored them. This kid did not have a medical condition- he had two parents without a drop of common sense between them, and he *knew* it.
Cute dog
I thought daz was married with a kid
Ah yes. Super Nanny. A childhood favourite of mine. I miss her show still to this day, kept me from being a dumbass kid and such.
Part of being a man is being responsible, the sayings are synonymous in this sense
Ngl, if a kid ever bit me, Id probably hit them so hard across the head they'd go flying. Not because Id want to, but just out of instinct.
Daz: she hade to think about her age  Me: what’s my age *four hours later* IM 13
Discipline is different from abuse
3:48 Literally my mum when I shout at her
Daz quote of the year  - lined up like little Nazis -
"look at jo,just standing there like a curtain"im dying
how do you water a dog
Oh its iggy!         You should kick him
DOGGO!!!!!
An ikea couch 😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀😂😂😂😂
You should react to worlds strictest parents :)
poor woman
If lil kid bit me I'm sorry I'ma hitem with a two piece hahahaha😂😂😂😂
Best solution take down to the Police station or Say that Santa won't come
I usually don't like people who keep stopping the video but daz just fills in the stopping with more jokes
Parent tip from Daz BITE HIM!😅
wait so your not lonely you just have a little shit running around just so you know daz this is a joke dont ake it serousily
3:44  "Now what do you want on your sandwich?"  _"Nothing!"_  "...Alright, and that's what you'll get. You'll also get my _BOOT!"_
The speech to young men staying with their kids is nice and all but you should’ve also addressed women who get pregnant but aren’t ready to settle down so they leave their children’s father. It’s what my mother did and it’s draining to a kid to be raised with so many different men in your life, none of whom are your father and none of whom want to be.
Bro if that mom was my mom she would've grabbed the nearest thing that will inflict pain on others and say "no me grites, estoy tu mamá no unos de tus amigos" in English it means don't yell at me I'm your mom not one of your friends
That looks like my grandparents Boston terriers
I love daz he my 4th favorite YouTuber
the 4 year old when he was on the table he looks like cat noir when he transforms
Guy just said he watered his dog? (0:18)
A drill sergeant would work 100 times better
Your not lonely, you have Linda
You know you're a your lowest of lows when a child says "SHUT UP" And you only comeback is "NO"
I’m from the south and we got a thing called a ass whooping never done anything bad ever again 👍🏼
When he talked about having two parents instead of one it's very true, i grew up with both my parents, and yes i have endured endless abuse from my dad, i'm glad he stayed, my mum wouldn't have been able to deal with me and my brother as well as pay for us as she works in a chippie so thanks for throwing that out there daz :)
I also would've hit that child of the table sorry not sorry
I am sorry I would have hit that child like across the world
my name is Shannon  am a bad child  TvT
You don’t you sure I’m probably he was mad because he want to toy he said no before because he said maybe he’s not hungry
REESE IS A TRUE ANKLE BITER ACCEPT HE WILL LITERALLY BITE ANY PART OF YOU
Gizmo Is so grown up now 😊
Gizmo: "you're career is ruined and I'm taking over" 😂
My mum does that it scares the shit out of me
"I've fed you, I've watered you" aww so touching. Btw, has anyone here know about MetaShiba, a new meme coin???
me: *falling asleep* Daz: AHHHHHHHHHH HES BITINGGGGGGGG!
This show so old when I was a child and used to be a little shit my mother always threatened me by telling me she gonna get super nanny to come to see house to sort me out 😂😂😂
Every one : wow what a b!tch  me : I WANNA DROWN HIM
hey daz lost count of how many times I've re-watched this
9:20 that's how you know you fuck Doo do do do do. Hahah
I think super nanny should be the super predator instead
I was one of the kids who beat my mum when I grow up and my mum told me what I had done I was on the ground crying in disgust and hatred with my self
"Hiya". As an American who lived in England, this is the most English shit I've ever heard. Next to, "You alright?", which, the first time, as an American in England I took literally and responded, "Uh, yeah. Why? Do I not look alright?"
i would bite other kids and a teacher and teachers would sit on me a tiny 2nd grader/ 3rd, and 3 plus size women. not fun but i had a bad household. but still i feel bad for that teacher and kids
this proves my point that sometimes, domestic abuse is the best option.
I will not stand for this Jo slander in which Daz is dishing out
She walked past the cat the cat meowed and she didn’t even stop to pet it the horrid woman 😕😕😂🤣😂🤣
love your dog
When I was younger my parents put me in the "naughty corner". It was hell.
"PULL MY HAIR BACK, AND PUT ME IN BLUE!!" -Daz 2021
when i was 9 my sister pinned me to the ground (I'm 14 rn and my sister is 7 but at the time my sister was 3 like how ut anyway) and my sister pinned me to the ground and she bit a chunk of skin out of my back
Can we see giz take a wizz
13:09 means so much. So many people see a misbehaving kid and resort to "mother doesnt know how to discipline" "that mother needs to control her kid". Daz looks at her trying her best in a tough situation and says "good mum" when so many others would complain. And I know for some people, that can turn a whole day around.  Another reason he is one of my favourite creators on here. He can make jokes but still has human decency and love
I fed you, I’ve watered you. New favourite thing to say😂
how is your dog so calm-   i also have a Boston Terrior named Pickle and she will never calm down lol
When Daz mentioned Blue next thing thing u know they lived in a blue house. Blue windows, Blue Lights and Blue everything and next thing u know the family will be looking like the Smurfs 😂
Bru these kids can be dealed with the south African way the belt the spoon or the flipflop
i remeber when my parents where like, you punch me, bit me ? the exact same thing i will do to you, efectiv ever mist behave again. Or amberase me in front of my freinds and never miss behave again.
My cats called gizmo!!!!
I love your puppy what's his name pls do a video to put your puppy in a video and have all the time there
Did someone say....            🧢            😆  TEA PARTY 🍵
i would just throw the good infront of a bus at this point
Personally Ive always wanted to use that finger on jo frost 😉😁
Daz can never be lonely HE HAS THE DAZZLERS
My school award for like... year 12? Was chosen by the (self-appointed) class representative, "most likely to bring the most to class" still insulted. Just cause I didn't have to leave class to get what was needed like everyone else
I am not even 22 yet and I'm having a kid I'm not going anywhere I'm staying
Learn to Discipline your children😂
If my son bites me he's gonna have 0 teeth left.
When daz says little kids just get angry na It’s not just angry this kids gets all these swear words I didn’t even know till I was way older he gets those words from somewhere
i’d slap the shii out of them, they’re not even cute they’re tears won’t bring sympathy
Forgot the hands cuffs i think we need to go for a mother f*cking straight jacket
daz has the sweetest heart<3
To be fair where did he learn all of those swear words. who ever is swearing infront of him is the blame.
“And Joe Frost is dresses like an IKEA couch” I CAN’T EVEN! “She’s got them all lined up… like little N*azis”
Daz: hope u have ur tea  me: that's actually not a bad idea also me: goes and makes tea
Your commentary is the best 😂
The reason Asians are not like these. Is because Asian mins use the stick. If you know u know...
Oooh My God Someone's Gonna Get Dropkicked Across The Living Room! YEP AGREED
This video is why I’m gay… no jk I am gay but some fricking kids suck ngl just being honest
8:54
People who do that to my mom have a death wich she will literally end your life
It’s the way he’s funny but so nice and supportive that gets me EVERYTIME, he’s such a sweet, loving person
I’ve fed u I’ve watered u
This man right here is my idle, much love to you Daz ❤️
Daz should do some more life advice and parenting advice vids
Good wisdom from Daz. Really made me think about the things he was saying towards the end of the video.
He's so cute.  The owners OK lol 😂😂
Thank you I know you probably won’t see this but thank you a couple days ago my “friends” stood around and laughed at me while saying they don’t wanna be my friends anymore but your videos help me a lot.. :)
Reece would be an amazing replacement for Ike from South Park.
This is the most brittish thing I've seen
The dad probably left after realizing his kids were demon spawns
11:39 ummmmmm what????
if these kids ever saw an arabic mom they would be chopped up in peices and in the mail to Syria.
Only ogs know gizmo
Said get a women pregnant I like men all I got to worry about is stds
“Oh my god this kids gonna get drop kicked across the living room 🤭😆😂🤣
If I even lift my hand for my mom I would die
0:20 IS THAT DOG A FUCKING JOJO REFERENCE??!?! IGGY?!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTTmLUhNWTs nanny reality shows be like
"theyre all wearing BLUE an unflattering color to wear at folk" prolly cuz he's british and reminds him of the french led by napoleon (this is a joke calm down)
0:54 it's a Smith and Wesson 500 magnum-

:[]
Throw the youngest through the wall :)

I used to have to sit on the naughty stair when I was bad I wasn't allowed to move or talk but I was fine because I wasn't that bad lol
🤣🤣
AHHH HES BITINGG omg I laughed so hard in that bit
Listen... the dad probably saw how bad the kids are and divorced the lady, then he uses the fight for custody but there playing hot potato with the kids!!!
hey daz im a big fan i love whaching your videos but dont usally comment x
Congrats on 7M subs! 3M more to that fantastic 10M!
All of us gets aggressive from watching spoiled kids in youtube.
Yes, you’ve watered your dog. I approve 😌
I would literally throw my kid into an adoption center if they acted like that. Yeah maybe I shouldn't have kids...
That’s pretty cool tho I once bit my mum and she bit me back so I never did it again
Omg
KIDS!!!
BAKA
They are a bad
I lost it at “there all lined up like a little nazis” and “YOUR SENTENCE SHORTENED OR FREEDOM?!”
My dad just pins me to the wall by my neck
I bet my mum is glad I was a good kid
9:15 My mom did the same, except her look involved raised eyebrows and a slightly open mouth.
whats the doggos name?
Hahahahahahahahahaha
00:17 “I’ve fed you, I’ve watered you.” Best speech ever 😃
WE NEED MORE OF THESE HAHA🤣
women needs to go milly rocking on these kids, super saiyan, not bloody whispering to them to stop, bloody hell
dude one day got a certificate for being good at fortnite and gaming 🙄
The problem with biting your child back is that most people consider that child abuse and can call CPS
11:03 my mother used to use the “naughty spot” but we called it the corner, because she would make you stand in the corner. And my sister would sometimes get in trouble when my mom was in her room, reading, and she would come out and yell, “GET IN THE CORNER FOR 15 MINUTES, BOTH OF YOU, DIFFERENT CORNERS, NOW” And sometimes I got it more than once, but I was born in 2008, and I was like 7, so sometimes she punished us to read for one hour, but I don’t really know why I hated reading so much, because I didn’t have an iPad, and we didn’t have an accessible computer for a 7 year old. So soon I grew to like reading, and now, my mischief has caused me to be literate. And the corner was very effective I must say.
I just imagine one of the children grabbing a knife and stabbing the mom, and the nanny just writing away in her little notebook, observing how they stab.
0:00 Jojos reference?????
Im sorry to say, but its always the white parents. My parents would have beaten my ass if I dared to hit her.
Oh my goodness Gizmo is so adorable
Just wup him with the belt
DaZ IS THE NANNY
whenever my parents would put me in the corner you would think that they were beating me with how loud I would scream...now I'm a decent human being :)
I love how daz is against men or young men leaving woman once they have gotten then pregnant I'm 14 years old and my dad left me as a baby I have never met him and I don't want that to happen to my kids I want them to have a dad If you know what I mean if you have a mum and a dad your so lucky
“She’s go them all lined up like little natzis”
im sorry but if reeces puff was my child, he's gonna end up in the neighbor's yard with a mark
Please come to Northn Ireland
this guy cracks me up😆😆😆
What's the dog's name and also you are not lonely you have all of us your dazzlers
now i know why kids get hit 😂
My mom would backhand me faster than the flash and ground me forever
tHaTs nAuGhTy 😭😭
Wait I have to go get my tea ☕️
bro my dog is name gizmo too
And there thinking..  ...  ...  ...  ...  Ye
Most of the super nanny episodes have mom's who are overwhelmed and either no dad or dad's who do absolutely nothing until the mom actually has to asl/beg for help. It pisses me off so much. Obviously there are fathers who are also in this situation, but that's not often shown and these shows tend to be filmed in a time where women where just starting to be working mom's instead of home makers. So it doesn't represent modern family dynamics. I'd like a modern, 2020-2025 version of this show tbh
“Hand cuff him” 😭😭😭
When I was little my mom tryed the "time out"  thing with me I would always get up and keep playing so she started locking me in closets
I am blue dabi Dee babi die
Finally a camera man filming a fight that ISN’T shaking
I have a Boston Terrier too!
you have a child
THE SHINIEST SHOES 😭
These people are called the Hewitt family they are on season 3 episode 2.
Everyone talking about the devil kids : Me just watching daz tell men and younger men a life lesson and being inspiring..
HIT THE KID
dog is soooooooo cute haha
11:28 its not normal for a kid to tell his mom kiss my willi
your a funny dude daz
7:49 kid: SHUT THE FUMK UP U FUMKIN BASBARD
Sometimes its ok to fix things with violence
I hate that automated womans voice, no matter the text, it's always so smug and valley girl sounding and I just want it in physical form to punch out a window.
bro tell that dog to look straight at me not at every damn corner in the room
gizmo has grown so much
You might be a lonely man with a dog but that dog is your true love
Is that a frenchie
Was your shoes dazzling
With my mother acting like him I’m basically opening a can of whoop ass
Let me eat my food pleaseeeee😂😂
im sorry but this mom has so patience. my mom would’ve beat me up if i said that to her😭
I love that dog! Is it a Boston terrier?
Supper Nanny is my cousin
Daz: I have my tea, I hope u do as well.     Me: *slurping on coffee at 4am to watch his videos as a coping mechanism*
ok but i just realised how nice daz’s eyebrows are
Did that boy say "kiss my willy"😃
I called my Mom a bitch ONCE in the car when I was 17, she was in the front and I was in the back and my Aunty was driving so my Mom couldn’t use the rear view mirror to give me her “Mother Look” so she simply, calmly but sternly without even turning around said “Excuse me?!”, I genuinely thought I was going to die!!! I had and haven’t since EVER been so scared of her, I simply said in a meek, (I’m going to die and be sent to HELL voice) said “I’m sorry”, she just said GOOD! and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the ride home! Needless to say, I’ve NEVER cussed at her since! 😅
14:24 I once got told to ‘man up’ by mum and some women in the background had a problem with that because I’m a girl
theseare little  kids their parents raised so some o it is their fault
I think… umm i think that… ummm… i think that sometimes it is ok to beat children.
Nothing has ever made me more mad in my entire life
My mum has 5 kids and raised them alone 💀
AHHHHH....... HE'S BITTING
Daz*
You make me laugh my head off Dax
that look tho 9.15
When did you have a child?
I love your dog
4:22  if that was me to my mom then I would be either paralyzed or dead
If  i did this at 4 years old icwouldnt live past the age of 5  Im no parenting expert because i am now 14 but most parents would become just normal people not a parrnt anymore
when you said “ i got my tea hope you have as well” i really went to go get tea
When Daz said,”OH THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE TIT!!! I literally died! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Prime example on why beating kids should be normal
If you think about it. How kids show expression as baby is physical. It’s just a natural reaction as you’re learning how to speak your thoughts to just resort to physical action when you’re overwhelmed
i dont understand why the mum doesnt just give those three kids a big fat slap
Been waiting so long for you to react to Supernanny Daz. You should react to The World's Strictest Parents next.
they are apart of crip gang
In my early childhood education class every Friday we watch Supernanny but we watch the USA version and it gets crazy sometimes😂
I love your dog !!💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
Daz saying at the start of the vidio: dont ask yes I am the lonly man with a dog / then at the middle : like my DAUGHTER / see u ain't lonly
is it me or is daz the funniest guy ever
i would havee goten beaten so hard if i did yhis growing up i live in south africa so it was definitaly hard
9:17 that look even from daz scared me
i think DaZ should be a comedian or something he is so funny lmao if he went on BGT or AGT i  bet he would win it flat out
THAT KID WHEN HE SWORE YOU SAID ooo someones gonna get drop kicked across the living room
Remember that vid you posted on tiktok of your dog being wierd his /hers eyes were crazy your so funny aswell
True dazzler? You'd know that he already told us this story 8:25
He has always said "look at it!" or "look at that!" the exact same way all this time. 3:16
WHI TH IS LINDA
DAZ: “Yes I’m a single lonely man with a dog.”  HIS OTHER VIDS: LINDAAAA
DAZ:  “Wholesome content.” THE DOG: ;_;
I once got a school certificate for telling my teacher that my favourite colour was purple!
drop kick the child
LINDA   LINDA   LINDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
“Joe frost is dressed like an IKEA couch”
That bab6 really said kiss my Willy
Cute dog btw Daz
You should give advice to single moms and dads
With closed captions whenever the kid swears it says it’s music
God loves you
Worst.parenting.ever aside from beating your children, please discipline your fragging friggle jacking kids like dam 😂😆
“You can kiss my willy” time stamp: 11:26
Just 👋🏼💨👦🏼🪦

i was an angry kid i’ve got to admit it!! i had a horrible relationship with my dad until i was about 10 because i was such a horrible, angry kid but i grew out of it !! daz is right it happens sometimes (i was NEVER this bad tho !!)
It gets me when he says Jesus Christ! 😭😂😂😂😅
My mum would tell me this “ GO ON THE TIME OUT” and I would stay there now I’m 10 and whatever age we are we stay there for how old we are
the kid pit his mums but
I also have a dog named Gizmo and its a Pekingese. He's nou about 3 years old now. Same color as your gizmo as well😊

The puppy is soooooo CUTE!!!!!! <3

Nvm I saw
What did he do when you when ooooo
The fact at the start of the video you said I've got tea hope you have yours and also the fact I had one though the video not expecting you to say you had one loll😂😂😂
daz isnt lonely, he has linda
gizmo is daz but in dog form
This was my life
"I am that lonely single man with a dog".   me:  And I am that lonely single woman with several dogs and cats. i vote we team up.
I’ve never hit my mum .she did the bitting thing with me when I was young and I never did it again. The naughty step worked aswell I had to wait on the step for as many minutes as my age
Sorry YouTube
My dad is gone cuz of drugs and now I’m fuck up
I live with a African mum and she did that me: sorry me knowing I f up
Super nanny more like madea
React to gacha Daz please
I don't get how that mum hasn't murdered her kids oug of stress yet
9:17 when they shout youre full name youre gonna get a belt to th leg or arm 10 times
not being sexist or anything but how is it always a mother on this show
You are very right daz
I'm a big fan Daz but be careful about perpetuating harmful stereotypes about single mums. A very very small amount of women (sometimes men too) have lots of children purely to get better housing. But tories often use it to justify giving single mums with lots of kids less help and blame their struggles on themselves, rather than the lack of support and absent fathers.
My mum says you sware one more time I will put soap in your mouth
As much as I do agree with him, there is always the option for abortion and if the mother choses to keep the child despite the father's opinions on wanting to get rid of it, he shouldn't be expected to give up his life because she kept the child despite him saying he didn't want it. If the roles were reverse and the father wanted the child and not the mother, everyone would have different opinions and that is where society is flawed. If she knows before the birth that the dad didn't want the child, she can do one of two things: firstly, she can get an abortion realising that she would be taking care of a child on her own and that she would struggle with that. Secondly, she could keep the baby and raise it. If she chooses the second option, that is on her. She can't expect a guy to give up his life just because she made a decision to keep the baby, as much as a guy can't expect a girl to give up her life because he made a decision to keep the baby. I would rather have no dad than a bad dad. I had no dad at first but got taken away and then adopted into a family with a bad dad, I would choose no dad anyday. A dad who is forced to be there will never love you fully, no matter how much he says he does, there will always be that thought in his mind that he didn't want the child. So I'd rather just have a mum who loves me than a mum and dad who will always have tension and a dad that can't ever fully love me.
My dad raise 5 kids and we never act like that
✝️✝️
Adoption is always an option
69mill subs ;)
If I did the same with my mom, I would be literally dead. Slavic moms don't play.
My father ran away when he found out my mom was pregnant with me.  A few years ago he came back and told my mom he was ready for taking care of a child now, but she was so mad and sad at him so she kicked him out of the house and he are not allowed to meet me, and I don’t want to meet him either. But I didn’t need a father to grow up to be an proud lesbian with a girlfriend (I know my father is super homophobic but I don’t care)
I used to have a naughty step as a toddler, I liked the time alone so I poured nail polish on the carpet then took myself to the naughty spot, my mum stopped using the naughty spot after that
Do you know what I thought that super nanny wanted to be like a cooking presenter like Gordon Ramsey like the sound of her voice
Omg DAZ YOURE AT 6.99   SUPER CLOSE
5:05  Little story about me😁 When i was five, there was this boy that would kick me, punch me in kindergarten. He would do that for 2 years. So then one day we where outside and i was climbing a lamppost (pls don't ask why) That same kid pushed me of and climbed it, then went off. Then it was my sister that climbed on and he pushed her as Well, then climbed on the lamppost again. Then I went again, he pushed me off, At that point I had enough, so I took his leg, bit it as hard as I could. The teacher tried pulling me off his leg with no success.😂 He never hit me again or even looked at me in the eyes. That was eight years ago and he still is scared of me.
I know where the dad is he went to get the milk
Is that a Boston terrior
Good words I’ll always be there  for my gfs baby in the future
6.99m subs
I have decided that i cant be a mother
9:07 I flipped off my mum and she reacted differentlu
cute dog
If I was there nanny I would onisly quite the time I got there😂
“AHHHHHHHHHH HE’S BITINNNNNN” 🤣
I love your dog is so cute
BAHHAHA NOT HIM OPENING THE VIDEO WITH “Birth control”
pause at 10:01 thank me later 😂😂
My mom and aunt (who’s a mom) were able to detect me giving them the middle finger from the kitchen. I was two rooms away and at the top of a stair case. I just don’t know man I just don’t
Well they do say that the first born animal goes to into the water
That dog is adorable
I used to wee myself in protest against the naughty step
iggy
Honestly daz. You're a real role model man, very admirable.
Has anyone noticed how at the beginning of every video, Daz just straight up screams the main topic of the video he's going to react to.....like just imagine you're in his house, want to knock on the door and you just hear BIRTH CONTROL
12:06 I would like that very much “SuperDazzyNanny”
broken dog
My dog is called gizmo
my mother is single mum of 3 i can say i feel sry for her as she had to deal with me when i was younger she had to hide the lighters as i was obsessed with fire
off topic but daz seems so happy with gizmo:)
Daz i have learnt more about life from you than my entire collection of life skills lessons
Gotta respect them youtubers who have dogs and not cats.j
Anything Diaz watches he makes it 10x funnier lol
Its true when they say dogs look like their owners
I'm watching this well having a cup of tea and what does he say at the start
There is something more scary than an angry mum     The belt
i wish my dad knew that
Ahhhh he's bitinggggggg
Awwwww doggy
no joke, one night I couldn't sleep, so I watches duper nanny for like 5 hours xD
9:56 love the dbz reference
He is wearing blue she is wearing blue I'm eating blue
🐅🐯🦁🐈🐱🦊🐺🐩🐕🐶🦍🐒🐵🐆🐴🐎🐶🦌🦌🦌🦌🐺🐺🐺🦊🦊🦊🐭🐭🐭🐭🐭🐰
Daz : I have my tea I hope u do to  Me: an Australian eating a meat pie while watching
I love that doggie 🐶 😍🥺
Yep my mum does that mum face when I do something wrong and I've seen the face so many time
Daz's reactions are priceless and   SO FUNNY!! Respect.
If she don't whoop them damn kid's
BloOd-DY Jesus 😂
Aaaaand this is why parents should be allowed to beat their kids as a punishment
The dog 😂 I’m so sorry but why does it look like that it’s very cute tho
“Oh god he’s adorable but he’s probably the worst one” 🤣  Daz honestly just thinks all kids are possessed by the devil  Edit: thank you for all the likes, I never knew I’d get that much
Cute dog
6:30  That flipping “super nanny” was cowering in the staircase
Speaking of deadly mom looks, blue or gray eyes can be scary. When my mom gives me a look and her eyes widen, it can be terrifying! But then they can give the warmest looks, y'know?
this kid should be on dragon ball
He’s actually so jokes 😂
The mother having 3 kids  My mum having 6  Me being the youngest getting away with everything
I used to love watching super nanny!
I was so stubborn as a child, when my mum told me to either apologize or sit on the naughty step, I'd sit there until the end of the day
If u dont beat them kids lmao
Where the hell was super nanny during all this😂😂😂
umm.. maybe take the stuff he is throwing.. just an idea that’s all.. like he has 100 things to throw at her, and she could just easily take it away…
I LOVE JO, idk why she’s just the best. SHE NEVER BLAMES THIS KIDS FOR BAD PARENTING
"There is always a chance of pregnancy." Me being a lesbian 😙✌
“Jam or ham” me both or just bread 🥖
That dog is so freaking cute 🥰😍
Milk
The dad went to get the mail
like littel Nazis 😂
omg my mum did the same thing when i was 3!
He forgot the best way to not having kids it’s pulling out
I got a certificate for 2 things, how well I used a jump rope 😂 and for "best body rolls" the dance moves not fat, well not then anyway haha... In grade SIX 😳😂 before the world was so PC 😂😂😂  Those are the great achievements I have to my name 🤦‍♀️😂
0:01 IGGYYY
1:45 was really funny when he paused it
One of my dogs is called Gizmo
Or maybe the dad is the one who's recording
Gizmo is a YouTube sensation now
He’s so cute
play station gone haha
Petition to get Daz to make a video with his mom
You tubes not 51  years old but 51 years ago was 1970
School certificates are whack like people could be perfectly behaved and do no wrong and get 0 certificates but no that little arseh*le got a certificate because he only bit 3 teachers and smacked 4 students as apposed to the 7 and 8 last week
Funny das quotes  He's adorable..but I bet he's the worst one  AHH THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE TIT..THAT KID CAN THROW  If I prisoner was shanking someone you don't say "SHORTENED SENTENCE OR FREEDOM!"  GOD THESE KIDS ARE SATAN.. they've beaten the shit out of everyone  Bloody Jesus and the cameras are there as well  Omg some kid is going to get dropped kicked across the living room  He is just beating the piss out his mum everywhere he goes
"a beautiful new BLUE passport"
8:19 9:32 omg ive never laughed so hard in my life that part has got to be my favorite part 🤣🤣🤣 i will admit daz explaining what he did as a kid when he got grounded by his mom is exactly the same way i got grounded when i was 6 years old i also ended up writing my moms name on my wall and saying "is a bitch" without the t cuz i didnt know how to spell it (Its still on my wall to this day after almost 8 years since im about to be 18 in about 4 weeks
jam or ham
Daz should be a family councilor 🥲
Wait why do you always say Linda if you are single and your daughter is called Sarah
( read in a deep voice )  I love your vids and you are so funny
First time watching this dude and he's SO FUNNY LOL XD
“i actually took her to the doctors because i genuinely thought she would turn into the next micheal miers or something..”
Super saiyan 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
OMG DOGY AHHHHHHHHHHHHH HE/SHE IS SOOOOOOKKOCUTE AHHHHHHHHH
You would be on the naughty step and you’d see something and you would mumble “Oh I didn’t know we had that-“
This episode made me so angry, that child is grateful not to be in my home.
like out of a polterguiestmovie.... im starting to wonder if every haunted house is a 6 year olddemon child
Love the tips: “bite your kids”
Of course Daz can make a two minute video into a fifteen minute video
Not me with my sweet iced tea, wide eyed and wheezing at every Daz reaction 🤣😂
the naughty step did absolutely nothing for me except get me hit when I didn't stay there. I wasn't told what I did wrong and I was just scared and confused
Daddy daz is a perfect role for him with his life stories😂🤣
Hey Daz, you looked a bit tired, hopefully you are sleep well and stay healthy!💙 (Also, don't question my username ;)  )
#teamseas
Why are they in school uniform for most of the show…
DAZ is so right, abortion is the answer to everyones problems 🤯
He needs riens and a muzzle
Like little natzis 😭
For my nephew when he was bad we would out him on a chair facing the corner for as many minutes as his age, worked like a charm. Although hes 7 now and we barely have any problems, hes a good young man.
“Ahhhh he’s biting😂😂😂”
I couldn’t do that to my mum I’d be spanked up into the moon and then drop kicked to bloody France
Mate if I have a kid and he swears at me and punches me I would grab him and throw him/her in there room
Who else loves the name of the dog xd
If my kid got to the point that I had to hire someone to get him in check honestly as soon as he cussed me there would be an imprint of whatever was in my hand on his forehead
When my mom said go to the corner I knew that I done goofed
2:61
I would just get out the belt and he would stop
Now image this with Black or Asian parents
I love seeing daz's doggy loving side. I mean did u see the smile he did when he was hugging gizmo
My mom forced me to watch that show and I gotta say I think my mom thought I was a brat😅
🤣😂
" shes dressed like an ikea couch"
Daz:"Someones gonna get drop kicked across the living room. Me:lmaooooo
Mans wise always stay for kids
5:36 Free for all!
This is why I  have snakes not kids
I bit my mom in her knee..xD......ALTHOUGH I was a decent quiet child..
Daz: ahh he’s biting
if i did that to my mum id be sleeping in the shed
When he talked about the biting he reminded me of a similar thing that happened to me. I used to hit as a toddler, not to be naughty but because I guess I found it entertaining or funny. One time I apparently got my mum in the face so she just gave me a light snack back, just enough to show me that it hurt, and I never did it again. I see mother's all the time saying "no stop, that hurts," but the child doesn't know what you mean by "hurts" they've never experienced it, so the best way is to show them, although you have to keep in mind that they are young and little force is required to show them how much it hurts. I love that he was open enough to talk about it.
1 hand on the kids rists 1 hand on the kids ankles then through out the window
7:46 😂😂😂 THAT MADE MY DAY
“And Joe frost is dressed like a ikea couch” I CAN’T 😂
Can the next video just be daz and his dog please
PULL MY HAIR back and put me in BLUE lol🤣🤣
Omg 😍 gizmo is cute
Omg daz I’m a massive fan I’ve subscribed
That is literally true 😆😆They do that look at you that literally true
The dog so cute
I honestly feel bad for this mother no one deserves the way she gets treated
Im 3
I had to get an ADHD test as if I sat down I was never able to sit still, in school I couldn't In other places I couldn't. Oh yeah it was autism because I couldn't talk til 5
13:39 Man that really touched a place deep down dude. I will try my hardest to be the best i can ever be thank you daz :)

Moral of the story boys dont go get milk if you get the girl pregnant
I grew up as a good child because my dad had anger issues so I knew not to mess around

DAZ USES CAPS IN TITELS> DAZ,WHY ARE YOU USING CAPS IN YOUR TITLE?
Near our house someone has about 24 kids. And I just love your face expression lol! “JESUS!”
14:45 that's why i don't want a gf bc that could happen and i ain't bothered
Life lessons with daz  I think youd make a decent teacher daz
Best opening yet bro prefcet more like that
"There all lined up, like little Nazis"
Ayo did that kid say kiss my Willy 😳
Am i the only one that heard the boy say to his mum “kiss my willy” 🤣😳 wtf
the mum shoulld of put her chrildren up  for adopcian
When he was  in the shopping cart he said to his mum kiss my willy and then I died of laughter
When I was younger I would keep myself in my room and throw my teddies around
ur dog is adorable
That brat
Your dog is so CUTE 😍😍🐕🐕🐕
I was born during birth control
"Shes got them all lined up...like little nazis" best way to describe children
My mum said she didn't won't kids but now she's got 11 kids no joke 😅
IGGY
my mum did the exact same thing to my brother as she did to you. he bit our older sister so my mum bit him and he never bit again
My parents disciplined with my brother on a naughty church bench I was sent to my bedroom for naps I hated naps has a kid now I love them when I got mad has a teenager I wrote in the journal 📓 📔 to get my anger out
7 pff I’m 9
My nana gives me those looks like shes gonna kill me
i had major anger issues when i was younger and i used to hit my sister and throw things at her and punch her all the time and she hated me but now we're better. i just found it funny how daz said "growing up" a bunch and just telling us stories
if their mom was black they would have been already DEAD lmaoo ^u^
his dog is a adorable give  it to me u.u
Am I the only one who noticed when they were in Tesco reece said kiss my Willy
I always remember as a kid, whenever my older sister did something wrong or was rude my dad just did this death stare and then stood up and shouted at her to go to her room, and to make sure she did he chased her up the stairs bursting into her room, then shouted more finally slamming her door and walking away
I can see it in your eyes. The dog👁👁
My mum disciplined us by sending us to our room My dad would shout and eventually, it would turn into who can shout the loudest match (Mainly stopped when the child being disciplined began to cry and make their own way to their room)  (by us I mean me and my 3 brothers)
is it bad that im 10 and i flip off my grandma and i started when i was 5 she still dont know lol:l
It's fucking crazy to think my old primary school is being show to 2 and a half million people
“The Piss” out of his mum
5:27 Daz literally reenacts 'Charlie bit my finger'
Bro there is no worse feeling than seeing your mum cry
I would of kick them to mars
Butter👍
Did you lose your kid
'Standing there... like a curtain' Daz 2021
it’s ok daz im a lonely single girl with 3 dogs
Really you watched super nanny and all their was were daz and the mum the nanny did nothing
Ohhh some kids going to get kicked across the living room I love that 🤣😂
When Daz said “that’s naughty!!” In the microphone it got me I was wearing headphones
Omg I have a Boston terrier they are so cute love your videos 🤪🤪😁😁
Awwww Bless Lil Gizmo 🐾🐾
Oh my brother bit the shit out of me I smack the fuck out of him he tried to cry to mom then she babies him but never bit me agian
U know those reward papers of having good grades, I ripped mine up bc I felt like a failer at night one time
Birth control helps with periods to bc if we can't have one we take it
Even if you and the women don't work out you can still co parent respectfully and not run off you can still be there even if you don't like the women because you made the choice to do the nasty and now also half your responsibility half the others. There are plenty of people who don't make a good couple but Co parent amazingly  together
I love how Daz doesn’t downgrade or talk bad about the mom. He recognizes that she might be a single mom who just doesn’t know what to do or how to control the situation. I respect and admire this man so much.
Daz should be a PSHE teacher he has some of the best advice for people he’s a great guy he’s someone I’d love to have a drink with when I’m allowed because I’m 15 but still Daz is someone I can highly respect
DAZ HAS A DOG- WHEN?
Someone once told me that Boston terriers looks like Pennywise and I can’t unsee it.
idk if it's just me but when I watch these I really want to just kill the kids preferable then
What is wrong with White parents
THE LITTLE BOSTYYYYYYYYY
Child rude to parents or anyone else=grounded and take away whatever they have
at the shop he says kiss my willie lol
Cute dog
Where are the good old days where you were sent to the ICU for just talking back to your parents, not even in a rude tone
I think you watched the wrong video because the real ones show when super nanny fixes it or sometimes theres a pt 2.
If your kids bites. Adoption.
Don't worry Daz watered his dog
You know I have to respect you talking about kids and pregnancy my nephew is one of those kids that takes a mile and the father is not around at all because he would much rather do illegal stuff then even acknowledge he has kids because he gotten other girls pregnant also... the saddestpart he had the perfect gf also she was loyal and was happy with very little but he destroyed his whole life when he started to cheat on her. Honestly I even grew up without a father because my father was only in it for the money he was one of those types jumping from woman to woman getting them pregnant and taking all there money he spent about 75+% of his life in prison and he never wanted to say I was his so his family never wanted anything to do with me either. Honestly seeing them like that and wishing never to be like them has left me so alone because I just never want to risk me turning into my father... I here it from my mom all the time "your just like him" and honestly I run things like that through my head when I talk to anyone I would like to be with... I always end up being the good friend that hides away feelings because I never want to risk hurting someone I care about... oh boy here I am talking to much again sorry...
i would not have children after the cussed at me and hit me
At 11:26 just before he pauses it did anyone else hear the kid say kiss my Willy to his mum 😂
Daz’s dog is sooooo cute and beautiful but he looks slightly high 😂
im 11 years old 😀😀😀
I doubt I'll have kids, or will even want to for a variety of reasons. But in the off chance it happens I'll probably raise them how I was raised. If they act up you'll offer the soft punishment first (i.e., go to your room, sit on the stairs etc.), and they'll have 3 chances to do so. If they don't then they get the hard punishment (i.e., spanking, etc.).  Politeness only gets you so far, and if you only ever give soft punishments eventually the kid will stop seeing them as punishments. "Go to your room" will eventually become an excuse for a nap, etc.
Anybody else thinks that dog looks like Iggy from Jojo- or just me :,)
If these were my kids I’d just use ‘self defense’
you know whats really scary? when you accidentally swear and mum brings out the fairy liquid
11:16 💀💀💀🎃💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
IGGY ?!?!?!?!??!?!?!
his dog is igyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy GIVE ME YOUR DOG NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love Daz, he takes responsibility and always tells the truth
Lol almost everything Daz said is true. Those kids would have seen a tornado of a whoopings would happen instantly.
SATANS SPAWN
Im usually against using violence against kids to educate them but in cases like theses i really don't see another way. Im not a mom but i don't think i could just take it the way this mom does. Bless her.
Gordon in the making
i thought u had a wife and children
When he bite his mum all thought about was luis saurez
I thought daz had a girlfriend, she did his makeup
I feel left out with Daz, we're not wearing blue :,)
Also having kids to get housing bad idea they won't give you anything till the kids are like 10 lol we have 4 adults in a 2 bed flat! It's so hard to move out these days. We been waiting a year and that's before being able to bid on the council houses! You either need to be overcrowded or kids have to be over age! And they stopped helping people with so many kids now I believe lol
Hehe my dog is so needy. I have a husky the faces he pulls are priceless! Can safely say kids are actually easier than him lol I helped raise brothers. If I gave them options and they said nothing. They would get bread and butter simple. If we were shopping and it was a store they wanted they play up we leave. Store I needed such as groceries they would be told to sit out the way of shoppers while I got the shopping down that aisle then they would follow after.  If they whined and spoke to me rudely I'd say ask properly or talk properly and nicely or don't expect a response then I'd ignore them. They got absolutely everything a kid could want we had lots of fun times I once made them a mini fun fair! But treat me like shit your gonna learn it don't work in the real world when you get older and it won't get you anywhere with me lol most the time we had zero issues because they just knew that they would get respected and treated equally if they acted right.  I know its hard though but definitely worth doing from day one! I'm all for kids being treated fairly and involved and stuff it teaches them that they are valued so long as they give the same respect :) I'm also glad you told the biting story. We were raised the same way it doesn't do damage it just teaches you that it feels bad and isn't nice.  All the kids in our family bit once lol just the once! I feel bad for the good kid I was the good kid growing up! Part of me wishes I hadn't been for how that ended!
You            are absolutely right
I got my tea TIME FOR A TEA PARTY!!!!!!!!!!
Son: hits and curses at mom My mom: 😀 *Shows collection of belts* Pick your death sentence
Will and James need to do a vid with daz
Is Daz Black related to Jack Black
it's just the look and you just instantly see a message  in the sky, you're gonna die in 3.21 seconds
4:39 I DIED

NEW WWE MACTH ON TODAY!!!!! MOM vs THREE FUCKING WILD ASS KIDS. COME SEE IT NOW BRAND NEW
I’m never one to condone hitting your children but if they were my kids… they would never see the light of day again.
If that boy was screaming and kicking going across the bridge with me I’d literally Chuck him into the water 🤣
put them in foster care
put them up for adoption
“Like little Nazis”      -Daz Gaming 2021
when you said going to the kitchen i thought u were going to say going back to the kitchen... to get a knife in a chill tone almost kinda under ur breath
My sister bit my toe when I was little I was like wth is wrong with you you filthy animal
Awe when did you get your doggo? He's cute
Your Boston terrier is cute
Like little nazis 💀
*video starts* Daz: BIRTH CONTROL!
Me: Why Are they Lined up? Daz: Nazis
Smack him just one good smack on the cheek and he is gonna shut up (i know it works cuz my mom has used it on me for 12 years now im 14 btw)
I couldn’t breathe when you mocked your mum
If my kid acts like that I'll 👏 CLAP 👏 THEM 👏 OVER 👏 THE 👏EAR 👏
‘Pull my hair back and put me in blue, NOW’ 😂😂😂
Daz there’s nanny’s 911 it’s worse than suer nanny please react to nanny 911

3:06, anyone notice the kid take the supernannys bag
His name is gizmo 😯
OMGGGGGGG
I know how this older girl feels I am the oldest of 10 others I hate it.
Daz: I’m not insane Me: that was a bit to defensive
My mum used to have a superpower She could tell you off at a normal tone  But my ears literally burned and I would know it was time to shut up and be extra good  Then again my she'd already raised 4 other boys to adults before me so she wasn't new to the job
OMG
Go’s it just me or is gizmo just so cute and amazing 🤩
When I was a child and was put on the naughty step my mum or dad would stand outside the door like some sort of warden it was terrifying
You jiz in giz
send them to Asian/Arab parents for a two days and they'll come back as saints
Damn that 4 year old is worst than me and I'm 8 and really really bad 😂😐
I have 17 sibling and I'm the youngest and my oldest brother get on like a three
this is why you beat your kids pull out the belt three or four thwaks on the arse and your done problem solved
I remember when I unplugged the vacuum when my mum was hoovering and it didn't end well
my dogs name is Gizmo as well
Got them lined up like nazzies 🤣
12:31 felt myself having a seizure
When he said “ahhh it’s biting” I lost it 😭😭
Handcuff him😂😂😭
Loving your uncharted posters 😏 best video game franchise ever
Gizmo hahahaha I love it
There’s a reason why I want an only child
Haha if my siblings did this we got beaten like fist in the face till we quit and if we did not  the belt came out and we got wiped
Bro daz is fr the best gay guy but fr isn't gay it's just so iconic
Get a dog name it.            Jizz
“You don’t tell them SENTENCE SHORTEN OR FREEDOM”😭😭😂😂
Jo in the middle of the room 😂😂🤣
Nice shoes
I have a french bulldog too, but mine is retarded(no joke).
I want to go back in time and show this video to my father (who i rarely see) so he would stay. Even for his other family, the same thing happened. I also feel very bad for my brothers mother and my mother because the two lovers that they had left them, they also both have a child that are born 1 month apart (me and my brothers mothers' oldest son that has no relation to me other then sharing two little brothers).
When it mum gives u that look ' It was at that moment he knew he fucked up '
4:53 i’m dead 😂
CUTE DOG AHHHHH
Please don’t say no please don’t say a naughty word
Don’t say a naughty word
I gotta get this nanny workout regime. She built like a wardrobe
'like a curtain' i just choked on my water and currently cannot breathe
7:48 if I did that to my mum I would have been slapped into next week 👁👄👁
I named my hamster after your dog ... but i think mine is more crazy 😂
That’s a Boston terrer
Awwww gizmo 🙂
Hi
11:30 kid says kiss my willy and if i said that to my dad this would be me 💀⚰
14:37 who else saw that in the background
My mum also bit me after I bit my sister and I never bit again.
7:45 bruh wtf what’s with the language
ham is funny
Ooo someone gonna get drop kicked a crossed the the living room 😂😂
REACT TO DHARMANN PLS DAZZ! YOU WILL GET US ALL DAZZLING
😀🥰😊 daz I Love your video
ikea couch 😭
This is why you beat your kids
Your tooooooooo funny🤣😂🤣😂
WHERES THE DAD?!
anyone else remember him from vine XD
Daz: i am not mentally me: are you sure about that
Me: Calmly watching Daz: AHHHHHHH HES BITINGGGG  Me: Gets terrified  😂😂🤣😅
Give the sliper
If I hit my parent I would in up in the clouds and this kid just gets "no don't do that"
these kids need the hell beat out of them like what you just going to let the girl hit your face like what the fuck woman
His shoes must have been like a mirror 😂😂😂
The mom look! Its a phobia in my book
This is the first DAZ video i have ever watched and omg never have I ever subscribed so fast.
Yeah I don't want to have that chance SO THATS WHY IM GAY AND A BOTTOM
has the mom ever heard of PHYSICAL PUNISHMET
Honestly if i ever misbehaved like some of these kids i would've gotten slapped.....like a lot😂... what Daz said about the "mom look" is very true
Use a fly sweater mrs
Just but the kid up for adoption
Daz saying imagine not being able to have any free time go out for a drink with your friends.  Yep that’s my mum for u she gets 3 hours of sleep a day IF SHES LUCKY and has to look after kids all of the time while doing jobs around the house and if she’s not doing that she’s at work and she also cooks meals for the whole family and does most of the stuff that u wouldn’t even notice like, having clean clothes and a clean bed, having meals. And more.  Sometimes I don’t think people give their mum or dad if they do this work dads can do it too they don’t give their parents the love and respect they should have. That’s why I try my hardest not to ask my mum for much help and try to help her as much as she can because she deserves it.
Ok but who teaches the damn child to swear I wonder where he gets it from HM?! 😐yes that would be the parents
whenever i used to bite my brother or say something mean to him my mom would come over to me and flick my mouth and since i used to bit anyone who would try to tickle or do any of those things to but my mom kept flicking my mouth(same goes for my brother)
simple solution :beat their ass
argh, man.I remember a time when my dad was sweeping the floor and he told me to do the kitchen(filthy and dirty from my brother's mess.) and i did the exact thing what Daz did! I mocked him but i did not do the flipping off but he caught me making silly faces and he  gave me such a glare that i felt at that moment, my soul left my body.
Anyone else remember when he told the story of him flipping off his mom?
lol
If u was that mom near the pond holding him I would thro him INTO THAT POND YYYEEETTT
If I ever raised my hands to my mum. WHOOOOO I would be six feet under
Daz what about Linda your not a lonely guy with a dog u have Linda
👋
My dad left me when I was little it was very hard for my mum to go threw being a single mother I had to stay with my nana fo like five years
Other mom be like belt or slippers I am very sorry for parents that u can't hit not hard or make them scared By something but make them learn like don't abuse them
Kid: *swearing*  Him: *oh no some one is gonna get dropped kicked across the living room* Me: 🤣☠️
🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🤚🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
7:18  “She’s just a nervous wreck-“ “HÖNK”
How does she have this many kids and not even having one sensible?
Daz: *Jo’s just dressed as an IKEA couch*    Lmao.
Also that 5 year old is 3 years younger than me and in my family I’m the swearing king and he nearly beat me
If I ever did anything like that I'd be dead
Or they got different houses bc they felt uncomfortable in the same house?
6:35 that girl do be looking like a volleyball spiker
🐈👍
then you will be super uncle
Where is Linda and your daughter
My mom would have beat the shit out of me if I ever did ONE of these things
Yeah , I used to call my mum a lot of words but never bad words , there's this one time and was mocking her and i said a curse word while whispering and she speed walked into her room and grab her metal belt , worst day of my life really
My dogs name is gizmo
Jo looks like the kind of woman who could break a semi truck in half and eat it for breakfast.
My mom told me to do the dishes once and I said no and she got so mad at me she chased me around the table then I locked myself in the bathroom
If my child bit me i would yell RABIES!!!
What a slap
8:04 is so relatable the mom look is so scary
"And Jo Frost is dressed like an IKEA couch"  I spit my coffee out at that
Your teaching me more than school did😂
14:46  Daz: Your life is gonna change, but....     Daz life.
8:12 😂😂😂😂😂
Oh gosh super nanny lol
When he said super saiyan he wasn’t wrong that kid went further beyond AGGHHAAAÆUGHHHHH HAAAH
13:42 to the end is very true. All men need to hear this
If I behaved like that I wouldn’t be here. My mom would have backhanded me all the way to Narnia 💀💀
Do dog cam Like so daz can see this
Men don't use birth control
U watered him
There is something called slippers and beating
His dog looks exactly like mine
Lol my names Reese
Yep that's what happens
I grew up in a Hispanics household so I am surprised and traumatized that kids do this my cussing does this and I was in shock my parents taught us manners as if it was the most important thing
YOUR DOG LOOKS LIKE MINE!!!! A dork- but like- IT LOOKS LIKE MINE
Parenting with Daz 101: just BITE HIM!
If birth came with a receipt....
Can we have a Gizmo cameo in every video??
I swear if my naughtiest cat ad 20 of them they still wouldn’t be enough to beat them cats
i got a certificate for giving effort in class. I was putting effort in class because i wanted a certificate. they weren't giving me one and I wanted to feel special. They gave the certificate near the end of the year and I hadn't gotten a certificate until then. I was happy, but upset that they waited THAT long just to give me a 'wow you put effort in your lessons! good job!'.
Lol! "I've fed you, I've watered you."
“Pull my hair back and put me in blue” 😂
When I was naughty when I was younger I was put on the naughty step. Say that I was 5 I had to sit on the step for 5 minutes
Ha he’s so cute and funny is eye
Tip from Daz  If they bite you, bite them back
If that was me i would be dead. My mum , my aunties , my grandma , and my dad. would be whooping my ass until that shit was in another universe.
w
8:40 bruh i flipped my dad off BEHIND a wall, and BOIIIIII my heart dropped when i heard his big ass feet trompin round that cornerrrrr whoooo XD
IF EVEN THE thought  of hitting my parents came across my mine even for a SPLIT second I would meet my maker...I only hit my mom ONCE in my life when I was 9 -10 and my mom went ham on my tail I had to stand for 2-3 hours  because if I sat down it would hurt like hell and it still hurt for a day our two. Lesson of the day kids sont hit your parents it's like biting the hand that feeds you and you'll regret it in the future
"that's how I get moms attention, I relocate her jaw" killed me
She's got them all lined up 😁  ...  ✨Like little Nazis ✨  🤣🤣
My dad flogged me when I did some thing bad he’d hit me harder if I did something really bad so hard it left a red mark and I would never do it again
belt the kids once or twice and they wont be swearing and hitting there mom
I had the naughty step. This day I miss that step when I go up stairs 😜🤪
I know it sounds weird but you should react to the song piss on the floor by auntie jackie
The best medicine for children like that is a old and sturdy belt
I got the naughty step we had to stay still but learnt our lesson
my horse sadly passed away this week and this is the first time i have actually laughed and meant it. thank you. you make me feel so much better. thank you for being you<3
omg my mom used to tell me if I switched the lights on and off too many times it would blow up…  now I know she was only partially right- it would blow up her electricity bill >_<
Can't happen in an African home
A few seconds into the video: BIRTH CONTROL! WE ALL NEED IT!
And joe frost is dressed like an ikea couch IM DYING she got them all lined up like lil Nazis I CANT AHHHH HES BITING I CANT BREATHE omg some kid is ganna get drop kicked across the living room IM DYING
you  have a   great    kid
If I did that my mother would kill me💀☠️⚰️
"and before you say it yes I am that single lonley man with a dog" lol😂😂🤣🤣
If my mum put me on the naughty step I would just walk off
Is that dog another jojo reference
He said”kiss meh willy” 🤣🤣🤣
✨3:48✨4:31✨5:05✨7:51✨8:43✨
This man is incredibly. All the life’s he has saved (including me) by just being himself is amazing
The pup in the beginning was SO CUTE. I awwed so hard I twisted my vocal cords 🥺🥺❤️
7:45 jeeeez that kid
he said lined up like little nazis im proud
I got a certificate for being stubborn when it was presented to me the teacher said I could imagine this student chained to a fence saying I'm not moving (still yet to be chained to a fence)😂🤣😂
When I was little super nanny continued to contact my my
everything about his mum is so true
his dog is LIFE
I don’t think Imma have kids… I woulda beat the shit out of the 4 year old
Puppy
Boston terrior
She dresses like marry Poppins.
The dog really said “ GIMME DA SUBSCRIBERS 😝😝😝😝😝😝”
If that was me my mom would’ve killed me or any mom I know would’ve killed
cool dog
Boston terrier
The part viewed here is just the first half. She sits down with the parent(s) after day 1 and comes up with a parenting plan in the latter half.
Almost 7M subs!!
😂🤣😂🤣😅😂🤣
at the start the name of his dog is the exact name of our dog gizmo from the ggremlins right
In germany these Kids would had have to forget their food and would have to be in their room until they be nice
daz you and jizmo look alike
THAT DOG IS SO SO CUTE
i have a dog named gizmo. he's a english mastiff and is around 8-9 years old
lol, Daz i used to bite my sister until she blead then my mom bit me not hard but after that i never did it again

Did Daz just invent Mum Mum i would read that comic book!
Lonely single man?what happened to your wife and daughter,daz?HOW MANY CHAPTERS DID I MISS

Lined up like nazis 😂
STOP MY PARENTS TOOK ME TO THE DOCTOR ASWELL WHEN I WAS YOUNG LMFAO
This is why I ain't having kids the second they acted like that they'd be put in the foster system

IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT EXTREMELY CUTE DOG IN THE BEGINNING
7:44 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
4:14 I'm dying lol
“Wholesome content” “I’m gonna put you down now giz”  Context, Daz, context
I’m watching the little boy and I’m just sitting here going hmmm not as bad as my brother tho 😁👍
He’s the incarnation of God himself.
Why would anyone ‘want’ to pay child support
3:18 ah yeah so i got a student of the week for a week i was sick  and dint go to school
Thanks Daz
I love how “super nanny” didn’t do anything the entire time.
I love this show and have taken mental notes for when I do have kids XD because yes. Even after watching many episodes of crazy children, still want to have kids.
i used to bite ppl. i bit my grandma once and she bit me back. havent bit anyone ever since…
React to bring it!
My mom used to put me in the naughty spot a lot when I was younger, she stopped doing it because she found out I would sleep in the spot.
Ok now hold on a fuckin minute… is that Nick Frost narrating the show?
Daz i fucking love you man!🏴‍☠️😍😎
I would put them to the adoption center
Man, you got lucky for having your PS taken away for only 2 weeks after flipping your mum off. I got grounded for 6 WEEKS for *cutting my hair too short*; I wasn't allowed to game, i wasn't allowed to date, and i wasn't allowed to use my laptop nor my phone between 10pm and 7am.
Smack them round the face they wont fo it again if it dont work then do it again
My mom would put us in the corner with a penny we had to hold the penny against the wall with our nose on hardwood floor if the penny fell she would hear it and our time out was extended by a couple minutes
He said kiss my willy in the shops
What happened between you and ur wife
If those kids belonged to an Irish or Northern Irish mum, let me tell you... *There would be no kids left.*
“some people may say he needs physiological assessing” me: “no he’s just a naughty little shit that needs punishment” 😂
The fact I swear at my dad 24 7
Why does that dazzlers hit more than that 4 year old
11:31 did he just say you can kiss my willie wtf
daz: “i’d give the mum a month” me: i’d give my kids a day…
DAZ I HAVE A BOSTON TERIOR DOG TOO AND OMG I LOVE YOU 😍 LITERALLY UR DOG LOOKS JUST LIKE MY DOG!! MY DOGS NAME IS FRANK!! ANYWAY LOVE THE VIDEO
id slap the kids 😒🙄
I would push him off the table, show him a lesson
How did daz turn a 2 minute video to a 15 minute video??
When I was watching this my mum shouted at my little brother up stairs 😂😂😂😂😂
My dogs name is gizmo too🥰
In America there is child abuse in Britain child abuses you.
Iggy?
Joe.....
Bro I watched a TikTok and it was this same family and I haven't even seen this video through and its about them 😂
"oh my god someones gonna get drop kicked across the living room" That shit killed me
Apparently YouTube is older than YouTube it self
Daz should start a daycare and beat them
You know it’s a daz video when he can make a 15minute video from a 2minute video😂
These are the people that don't believe in spankings.
so true
That kid should be in WWE
https://youtube.com/channel/UCEEh3Ydab3sqQc8Fb_l39pQ
rule 1: dont give kids anything with sugar
OMG HIS or she IS SO CUTE
I loved watching super nanny when I was younger
Lmao not YouTube in the comments
Daz pls can you do a video with no hat
DOG
Why was i unsubscribed who why when how
Two words: military school
that's why u have to give ur a kids a light slap when they're young
Kid: (bites mom) Mom: (Yeets kid in the corner of the draw)
And this is when a clip is in order
Bruh watch the american supper nanny it is a lot better in my opinion
"i was worried she was gonna turn out to be michael myers"..
its like spiderman but like she is bitten by another mom  -Daz😂😂
bite the kid -Daz
Imagine daz having a tv show like dr Phil
If i bit my mom bit me back and i bit alot but i still bite my boyfriend 😊
Tbf my sister was the same as shannon but then grew put of it
Daz: oh my god these kids are SATAN       Meanwhile I’m eating jalapeños nacho chees:*AGGRESSIVE COUGH WHEEZE LAUGH*
I love you daz. You are my favorite to watch for reactions
Sometimes its okay to beat the living shit out of a child
As a mum to 3 special needs children your reaction to this was so heartwarming!
9:52 omg
Ladies and gentleman, let me introduce you to the belt. This 40$ investment fixes children in seconds. Patent like a pro with THE BELT. $40 without tax. Shipping not included.
ITS IGGY
Daz life 14:47

Daz has a daughter?.
If I was a mum I would slap the shit out of the children
Wait daz you watered your dog
My dog is called gizmo 😀😁
Who else was watching the spit on his lip
It went from street fighter to the last of us real fast
I love gizmo he is so cute
i would just slap them that will teach them
What does the super nanny even do????
Kids watch your videos
man i would probably be six feet under if i ever acted like that with my parents as a kid
I AM DYING LMAO
9:15 my heart actually dropped that brought back a feeling I haven’t felt in a long while
Call a kid Shannon and it’s what you’re gonna get. Deary me
When I say this I am not kidding, I got an award for moaning the most lol.  I always was laying down there tired Doing basically nothing but... Come on
If there was a black supernany these kids  whoud be killed
"these kids are satan!" lmao. I watched this show years ago and it was literally PAINFUL. I couldn't stand living one day in the life of these parents with these satanic children. FR!
Is that a frenchball dog
You know I got soap in the mouth for swearing for the first time my dad said Chris she said a swear my mom took me straight to the bathroom and made me keep soap in my mouth for several minutes it was that liquid soap 🧼 Ironically I hated tasting the lavender soap but I love the smell of lavender now 🤣
Gizmo🥺❤️
WHERE IS MY OLD DAZ BPACK WHERE HE LAUGHED UNTILL HE DIED AND THEN MAKE FUN OF THEM NON STOP (but i stull love you and youre still awesome
I can't take my eyes off the uncharted poster in the background-
Damn the kids are good he’s in all the spots bull’s-eye also how do they know all those curse words yet so young  5:38 you should probably blurry that
Bro I always love your videos because of how funny they are and how creative your insults are
Why is super nanny so damn hot
But the thinks is, I wouldn’t eat a sandwich for breakfast either 😅
I wouldn’t survive doing anything anyone did here
And sometimes the dogs 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
These kids r like my cousins kids but no where near as DEMONIC one of the youngest ,Zara she is the most demonic and deathly child I have ever met - I am genuinely scared of her 😂
GIZZIE
Im almost an adult and im several inches higher than a fot taller than my mom and she's put the fear of god in me and id I did any of that even now, my mom would still to this day, put the fear of god in me
this is what happens when you don't beat yours kids
Would’ve give him the belt
You know this is very inspiring because I didn't even know what my dad looked like and sadly I will never see him but thank you for your message😄👍
11:33 push em in the road
7:51 Oh my god some kid is gonna get dropped kicked across the living room -dazblack
Heaven forbid... I would have had my ass obliterated
Me and my sister are the definition of the biggest arguments you’ll ever see
Daz talking about the color blue   Me wearing my blue work shirt 👁👄👁
Just him explaing women and how men should be there and women he’s just 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
Daz said bite him 😂😂😂
That’s why you have to have a belt
Mum sounds like Kathy Beale from Eastenders
"Ahhh right in the tits" -Dazz
My parents would just 👞🥾🥿👟👢👡🩰🩴💥💥💥💥
When your mum makes that look I call the ambulance and tell them to send someone.
Daz is that the dog from jojos
I’m dying I remember when I watched this episode and I cried because my mum said if I be naughty she’ll send  super nanny
If I acted like that I would get smacked into the next time zone
Daz I cant do this right now I’m trying not to laugh 😂
When moms give the look you just know. You fucked up.
Is your dog named gizmo
Unless the family was told to act some of this footage of them causing trouble, if you think about it the people controlling the camera were just watching her stress out
If that was a asian family💀GG
No lie, when I was like 2, I bit my mum on the shoulder, so she bit me back. I never bit anyone ever again. It works.
13:38 Amazing Life Lesson
Iggy?
My mother only had to pull over once in the car never done shit like that since I was 5
Hey,I have a question do you have a wife. No hate.
Wait I thoght he had a wife and a kid
I Don't think it's spite, as adults we know when we run out of "social energy" so when they act out they are just tired of having to people and have a breakdown. It's called post restraint collapse and is super common in children with good social skills
Daz is literally a role model
My mum done that too like one time I stamped my feet then she stomped on my foot the I bit her then she bit me back and another time I pulled her hair then she pulled mine back and I never done any of those things ever again 😂
I also got an award for a really weird thing..   I got an award for losing my jumper the most out of my entire class..
7:46 Fiststly where are the bad words coming from and if it was my mum it would be a ticket to heaven or hell
The dog looks like iggy from jojo;-;-;-;-;—;;-;
Daz had dazzling shoes 😌 also my mum would have murdered me if I thought about talking back 😅
If I did that my dad would lock me outside while all I have on is my pants 💀
I would kick the shit out of those kids  No 🧢
Ahhhhhhhh he's biting 😂😂😂
my 1 mom is scary, as a lesbian, i cant imagine how scary 2 moms would be for my kid tho
I feel like people with baby siblings will be the best parents
She can take punches, I bet if her and master chief went into the ring I bet any punch would bounce like she’s a robot  Edit:bro you said “handcuff him” before I could, great minds think alike
life lessons with daz
This man here taught me a good lesson. Know the risk, and take on the responsibility of having a child. I wish ever kid and dad watched this video.   Thank you Daz
Has anyone herd of a belt before?
Awwwww cute dog
my dad used the naughty spot on me and my sisters. we had to stand in a corner for an hour and we couldn't talk, move, or sit down. so scary as a kid
the world needs more people like you.. you are one of the most amazing people. keep doing you 😌
7:04 its probably a dart
I always get a laugh out of Daz! The mom look had me dying
Charlie, that hurt!
"she's got them all lined up....like little nazis" -Daz Games 2021  LMFAO IM DYINH BWHAHAHAH!
If I tried to hit my mom my head would be through a wall😂😂😂
Now that I think about it I wonder how many people from the americas view this
Don't you miss the good old days when you could smack the kids back harder
Jo mama
The kid sound like he is saying Baka lol
4:14 Hahaha you've gotta love daz
I hope he watches more Super Nanny!
This is just daz being a father for 15 minutes straight 😂
I'd be dead if I tried any of that

the end talk 📈
Gizmo is so adorable!!!
Just hand em to a black or Asian parent they'll be fixed in a couple of hours
Gizmo really said 🌒👄🌘
Im 14 and i think i would be a better parent than this mom
When i was little i had a naughty spot, and it was by the cat litter box, and my mom would threaten to put the cat turds in my supper.
Remember, beat your kids
DOGGY
My dad just made a paddle for me and if i did something bad he would use that
Does Supernanny has no kids
Daz "I have watered you" Me"WHATTT!!???
I think he is turning in to one punch man
Someone woke up with an attitude
My mom was a single mother for 10 years My dad left when I was 5 months old Now that I look back at it I'm just imagining how hard it was for her to work, take care of me and do everything alone.. I was a pretty naughty kid  My Dad doesn't even bother to visit me :/ The only thing that I have in common with him is my last name. It's ok now though because my mom has found a new boyfriend and he's living with us. Honestly he's a way better father than my biological one    Ok this was so random and not really related to the video.. 😅💀 Anyway....
When he talked about the parent death stare, I genuinely had chills go down my spine.
Daz having a wholesome moment with his dog, then outta no where,   "BIRTH CONTROL"
I stayed a really long time on the naughty step
im sorry you only got two weeks of punishment thats the standared when i do anything wrong like `1 week if im lucky
ayo my cats name is gizmo
Daz: I have fed you I have watered you Me: EH
More reasons I never want kids
I once pissed on my sister and I’m not jk I actually did
Me seeing the 4yo: never having children
Daz was written by a woman.
Bruh come on dont leave the girl you got pregnant alone come on boys!!!!
New phobia unlocked: childphobia
i've watched daz for 4 years and he's getting funnier and funnier every time, this is how i smile
I’d just 🤜🏼🧑🏻
The only problem about that mom is that she’s not Mexican
Yup a tanned arse would soon put a stop to his tantrum actions 😊
TBH I do the mouthing and flipped everytime mother argues with me 🤣😂🤣😂
My mom *slowly takes off belt*
I DEMAND A DOGGY YOUTUBE CHANNEL
At the 14th minute he starts talking about babys like a bomb
12:52   just       *yeet* the child into the um…..you know *lake*
when did daz give advise
I used to always watch daz but I stopped for some reason but I'm starting to love these vids again
This made me laugh so much 😂
If these were my kids. They wanna act tough I'd show them tough..... how this mother is controlling her rage. It's mind blowing for me
theyve got them all lined up..like little nazis lmao 2:03
That kids the new mike tyson
daz im the boy in battle that when i saw u  i whent what the fuckkk
she looks like the trunchable from Matilda
The mother look yes
She’s like a curtain 😂
AAA he’s BY-ING
(at the beginning of vid) ITS IGGY GET OUT HERE
Daz: Was that a screwdriver Me: No Day it was a dart
When I was younger we had the bold corner and at one point my sister went there so much that she would just wall there on her own
Ooh someone’s getting dropkicked across the living room
Wait is he actually single
anyone elese see the bug at 14:37
Ur doggg 🥺
11:29 “kiss my Willy”
Thats the best dog I've ever seen ngl
Nanny didn't do shit
lol daz has tought me more s3x ed than i ever have or will in school, weve never gone through it in school
Sis forgot her age lol
PLS DO A VID ON THE REAL PIZZA GUY
IM SORRY BUT THE DOG AT THE START IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOO CUTEEEE
Daz you were so funny in this vid I couldn’t stand you, you should have a second job as a Comedian😂😂🤣
My naughty spot was outside and they locked the door so I couldn’t get inside  I once was out there for 5 hours
7:50 - 9:33 thank me later lmao
⬇️⬆️⬅️
9:15 I did the SAME thing my mom did the stern mom look and I ran to my friends house
the fact that the cute puppy is called giz and my dog is called gizmo
i work in an after school program and i have seen it go both ways where from what i have seen with parents they definitely have a play in their child’s behavioural issues but i have also seen how tired some parents are because they are trying and sometimes it just takes longer with different kids
Das I’m 13 going on -4 and I ain’t never gon worry bout getting a girl pregnant for two reasons 1.I’m pan 2.I don’t and I will never get any 😺
As a person who has had an abussive mother growing up has been hard and threats and all of it has come aswell but anyone can get through it its like school but its 100x worse and it will be hard but keep fighting ❤🔥
HI
My respect for this man went through the roof when he started talking about responsibility. I swear, I wish he could have told this to my parents...
Daz: tells people not to leave if they get sm1 pregnant  Also Daz: proceeds to tell us how hard parenting is
"kiss my willie" LOOOL IM DEAD XDDDD
I remember when I was in year 7 we had this really aggressive Spanish teacher and she would mock us and say things about us and our family and one day we were in the computer room and after she had a go at us and I swear 8 of us flagged her off
As a kid I would run away or for example I accidentally locked myself in the car but I never hit my mum or anything of the nature in this video
The fact that he mentioned the conjouring made it for me
Parent tip: Especially with teenagers, NEVER yell back. Speak softly, just punish. It doesn't escalate into a blind, enraged shouting match or physical violence (normally) if you're not shouting.
Ur the funniest man alive
Ayy my rabbit is called gizmo 😂
the way he went oh fuck oh fuck ill go clean my room yes i will lol
puppyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
What the kids on that show need is what we would get when we were young a bloody good hiding
My mum used the naughty spot / step on the stairs and it worked for me
7:57
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GIVE ME THE DOG 🐕
It is never the angry faces or the talk back from a parent that makes you stop like that, it is the sudden death stare of ultimate disappointment that makes you go "It was at this moment I knew --- I fucked up."
That is the cutest dog ever
There lined up like little nazi's 2:00
Lmao I love Daz's side rants.
I say buy a cell
I’m a mum to two very young boys, and YES i can confirm we do have a “look”, every single mother out there has it! It’s honestly great LOOL!
I promise to my future, I will try my best to be there for kids of accidental happenings. I don't wish to let anyone suffer in this way.
I've got a King Charles Cavalier cross a Tibetan spaniel and he's got the exact same colours and is called gizmo after gremlins 😂😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
2 weeks ago boys
PUPPY
“got them all lined up ... like little Natzis🥰”
But if ur gay you wont get pregent
I’m gonna be real honest my parents would slap the F*CK out of me
0:19 we need a second channel just for him and let's see who's first to 20 million subs
Single what happen to the girl he was dating ?
anyone else see the vid of his dog humping his teddy bear
Here’s what you do. BEAT THE CHILD
I could never have kids cause if mine did that I would end up handcuffing them to the fucking radiator 😂
If i ever did anything like that to my mom she would drop kick me across the house
MY DOG IS ALSO CALLED GIZMO
UuUh
am i the only one who was looking at the food on his lip?
Super nanny in a nutshell: condom fails
I got the 'stern mom' look, and now i am quivering under my bed.
That’s my mom.Shit you hit me in the boob.look what you did I’m in pain because of you now
14:04  wot if i am gay

Cute little doggie💞💞💞
Daz: "I have my tea I hope you have yours too Me: raises my tea cup

Omg same I use to bit random children and my mum did the same and I stopped and never did it again
Me: hey babe let have a child.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Sees a naughty child: nah I am okay
Is gizmo a jojo refrence?
Dude ur reactions and stories are PEAK performance XD nailed the mom stare, ur amazing
I was hoping he'd like Jo 😞 She's so awesome 😂
6:14 my sister's 12 and she's still pretty violent when she doesn't get her way, mainly with my dad though, and he entertains it for some reason
9:14 you are so accurate - this scares me!
How could u dislike daz
It's funny how you said you thought your daughter would be like Michael Myers. My parents thought the same about me because I was a demon, I was 5 years old beating up kids my age and beating up my teachers. I had to have 5 teachers hold me down while my pupils were extremely dilated and would still escape my teachers grip. I also got kicked out of like 3 schools. After all of my counseling sessions and talking to people about it I've grown up a pretty good kid and now I'm 21 and I love everyone and people love me.
#Wholseme 0:00
if this kid had an arab mom hed be dead
Awww, I've never seen Gizmo before! My kitten was named Gizmo. I miss her a lot.
I remember when I was 13 my mum told me to clean my room and I didn't for 4 weeks so she woke me up at 6 In the morning and kicked me out of the house telling me I can't come back untill I finished cleaning the house. I was tired as hell so I went to my aunt up the road and sleep there untill my mom got me later that day
Works out 4 years later he’s on the Spectrum for Autism
I remember when my little brother used to bite me, my mum bit him one day. Never again did he even think about biting me or anyone ever again
I remember going to a babysitters house for about 7 years. 5 year old me threatens this other kid by almost hitting them NOW THIS FUCKING BLIND BITCH COMES UP TO ME AND SAY “NAUGHTY CORNER” drags me over there by the ear. I’m in this room with a window that is not locked I wait until no one is around and I climb out this window and I RUN AWAY  (I got caught by the neighbour)
Love you even more after this vid. Your an awesome guy and Dad Daz.  ❤✌
Good job
Oh shit the mom stare
Daz is so considerate for others

Being from the south the whole time I'm thinking "Beat the everloving hell out of that child"
When I was yong me an my sister acted like that one time and my dad smack us so hard and yell go to your room and I never even rose my voice at them again
I think you are a wonderful dad, you know the truth and tell it in a way most people would immediately listen. Good job 😊

I remember the naughty step working really well and I never got off but once my mum put me on the naughty step then she forgot about me and I was sitting the for like 45 mins before I asked if I could get off!
WHYS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT THE DOG ITS SO CUTE MORE GIZ 💅💕
9:17 terrifyingly accurate
Hey daz, please react to an episode of strictest parents
Daz would be a good nanny😂

Backhand that kid one time i promise u he wont do it again
Has the mother not heard of an orphanage? 😂
Where is your daughters mom? Sorry I'm just very curious
I had to get facial reconstruction because of that breed of dog
As an only child of a single mum I have to say, I am better off without my dad (he is abusive) but it’s worse to see men come and go from my mum’s life,
The dog is so cute
"abortion"....
Puppy🤩

I nearly lost my voice because this is so funny
That’s the same type of dog that I have Daz
**drinks air tea**
I have a mom and a stepdad and a dad and a stepmom but I don’t have a stepmom anymore she went bye bye
If I was like this as a kid I would have been bleeding on the floor.

0:10 👁👄👁
Can you say Tea party
Frech bull dog
Hi
I have to be honest when I was a bit younger I was also a bit nasty, I once shoved a kid off a slide when I was 4, and another time I punched a kid and broke his nose when I was 5, my mom told me that I would say that I would get so mad that all I could see was red, but now I’m doing well in school got a girlfriend got friends and I’m fine
DOGGO
I used to run upstairs when my mum put me on the ‘naughty step’
I love how me and Daz have the same type of mom.😂 (P.s love your videos🖤, you always make me laugh Even on my darkest day's.)
I'm also a single but not lonely person, soooooo sad I really want you to meet a lovely partner, if I lived in England I would also climb in the jacuzzi on holiday, but would not be the creepy man 😆
Wait he said he’s that lonly single guy with a dog I thought he had a girl friend
And I thought my brother was bad
I bet they pay the kids to be really bad at the beginning and then to act like angels at the end lmao
1:45 bHAe
hold up..   daz is a dad?
is daz still dating zoella
Daz: after that i didnt play playstation for 2 weeks  I WOULDNT BE ALOUD TO PLAY EER AGAIN
Finaly
2:02 BRO ICH MUSSTE INSTAND LACHEN XDXDXDXD
I would not be surprised if the mother went and full on slapped these little brats, I hate to think that might be the only thing to get them in line. To show them the dominant one.
If I had kids and they acted like that well UPPER CUT and then do the John Cena move the on them HA
This needs to be a series x
I flipped her of to and she also had senses
If my children did that I would wash there mouths out with soup or smack them
3:57
Fak ih🖕
“Was that a screwdriver?” “That’s definitely some sort of stabbing weapon” Daz 2021
SID U HEAR THE IID SAY “kiss my BEEEEP”
all these parents need, I a thick leather belt or wooden plank
OH.MY.GAWD.IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO MY WHOLE TIME ON DAZ GAMES
The idea of the father just leaving and the mother having to deal with everything makes me kind of grateful in a sense of the fact that our (my brother and my) dad left mom and us when we were older, my brother being almost 18 and me being 25. Granted, I'm very well aware of how much of a strain it put on my mother to endure almost 30 years of a very lackluster and mostly loveless marriage whilst she struggled to fix it, but i think it would've been worse in the long run if he left when my brother and i were both still little kids.
The council estate version of Mrs Doubtfire I’m CREASING!!!!!
Officer, i drop kicked that child in SELF DEFENCE.
Daz is it ok if i drink coffee imsted of tea i drink both but i pefer coffee?
Daz my husband never got me pregnant but he is more of a father to my daughter then her real dad and my daughter love her daddy kaszu so much and he loves her and me 2 what I'm saying is not all father can be dads
i feel so bad for her having to go and deal with that 4 year old
✨Puppy✨
God, the gold plate ass kicking I could drop on my "old man" ...Who ever he is. It's sad that it's so common to top it off. Bullshit!
This is what happens when parents arent allowed to slap their kids upside the head now and then
bro the part where his eyes went cross-eyed it was so funnny
discipline is not child abuse :)
I feel the same way with the oldest child my brother and sister are terrible I just stop trying to get my moms attention or even time like there just so bad I haft to tell myself “it’s ok she will make time for you one day” it’s hard and I also have lost my dad my sister has my stepdad and my brother is my stepdads real child so ya it’s hard
Daz with his dog:🥰🥰🥰🥰  Daz with the camera:😆😁😯😠 Daz with the outrow:😝😜😂
The tit punch... we all felt that...
I thought u were dating that one chick
Daz: I just want to help her out. Me: By drop kicking the children or...
When you said ‘naughty spot’ I was so confused until you talked about it and explained a bit and realized you were talking about ‘time out’. It’s insane how phrases and words are said so different based on where you’re from!
Imagine the children in this show watching themselves after they grow up
HELP OMFG
Is that a Jojo reference that's--thats iggy
Camera man be like 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎥🧍‍♂️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I would have drop kicked that baby so hard for saying the f slur
I agree with daz completely on the baby thing at the end There's only 3 scenarios I can think of where the man shouldn't have to be there for that kid 1. If the women raped him 2. if the child is proven to not be his 3. If the women 'baby trapped' him (when a women tells you she's taking contraception and tells you she can't get pregnant and then does but also forces you to help out"  All these situations the man could stay if he really wanted to (except for rape, he should get that bitch thrown in jail pregnant or not)
I knew I was in deep DEEP sh*t trouble when my mom would be cold, silent, and would glare at me. She never spanked, hit, or slapped me(she didn't believe in physically abusing your kids as punishment), heck she rarely got mad, not that she needed to, she lucked out on getting a boring geeky kid, but when i was 14 I wanted to see what I could get away with and I talked back to her when she got onto me about doing the dishes....man if looks could kill....never did it again 😭 😂
Soooooo is no one gonna talk about the cute puppy in in the beginning of the video 😂😂😂😂😂
Wholesome content
I just wana pick up those kids and  use all the tools my parents used ex:🩴 belt ✋ etc I’m just over here waiting for her to hit em- violence isn’t always the answer (but sometimes-)
gizmo got so big Xd
I like it how the little try to slam the door...Omg
Bro this is so funny
That little kid is the next UFC fighter
If I sweated my mum would beat my ass
Then tik tok be like: 📉📉📉
Likee whenever u make a video be like: 📈📈📈📈📈
9:50 and the kid is like goku doing super Sayian 3
I had a reward for the most colourful shoes too 😂🤦‍♀️
daz as a kid my brother was the excact same with the biting as u LOL
I remember when the dog was a little puppy
Whenever my mum put me on the step it’s like she could hear me breathe I moved slightly and went to kick the thing on the stair and she came flying in and I kid you not she just stood there but I was like oh well if she isn’t gonna do anything so I ran upstairs she then goes right then you do that but you’ll see what happens next day all my teddies and toys were in a bin bag she said if your good you can take one each day I was so sad that night bc I couldn’t sleep without one that I never moved from the step again
"some kid is gonna get drop kick across the living room" best line ever
My uncle got an award after he left high-school for the most detentions ever (he did have A.D.D. tho and school didn't give 2 shits)
my naughty spot was the garden getting locked in the shed or locked in my room
8:14 this is so relatable i still do this LMAO
2:52 They all work at IKEA
Lmfao when he said “OOOOHH RIGHT ON THE T!T” GOT ME SSMMSSJI
You are so right about that look
When  I yelled at mum I got a wooden spoon or a slap
I was mostly raised by my grandparents and if i even did anything that was considered rude or back talk they’d make me stand in the corner for an hour and if I did it again the time would double. Along with getting everything taken away(four-wheeler,xbox,tv, pretty much everything).After being in the corner for 6ish hours I was never back in it again.
and i thought i was bad as a kid
Daz's advice is by far the best ❤
CUTEST DOG EVER
I would have knocked out those kids
Puppy 🐶
If I did that I would’ve already been on the floor probably dead like even if your dad gets home from somewhere your mum like looks at him and then he automatically just like gets mad at you like he knows you did something and you’re like oh I’m dead
No efence but yo dog be looking ⬅️➡️
thats the point where you grab that rubber glove and hiyaaa
I hit my mom once I was thrown down a flight of stairs and then I cursed at my mom once I still can’t remember what happen I just woke up and had a sore head and ass
daz you will not beilieve this right, once, i was in the car driving to my nans and saw this kid on the path kicking the shit out of his mom and she wasnt doing anything and the person next to me said "id slap him round the mouth so hard he couldnt speak" 😂
daz: BLOOD-YYY JE-SUS
Daz: “lets get into the video”   YouTube:  “i would like to give you an ad”
13:45 till 14:47 is egit the best thing I've herd daz is so underrated :)
About 7mil subs
I'm actually grateful I can't have kids and never want kids haha!
Best outro
whatever the dads tell you to do you must do it,even if you don't want to.
the mother be like''meat or fruit''
hey Daz, I saw you on Michael McIntyre's The Wheel.
my mum used to sit me on the step and I remember i'd slowly move a step up until she just forgot i was meant to be there
9:17 Jesus was your mum Gus Fring or something?
i would love to see daz do his own skit as super nanny it would be the best series EVER HHAAAAAAAAAAAA  🍵
5:50 when Daz said he thought his daughter was gonna turn into Michael Myers.- 💀
More of these please Daz!
Some say daz’s shoes were.. dazzling
I don’t think I’m getting kids
"Being a parent is the most patient, demanding job." And you dont even get payed in cash🙄 (Edit): Lovely how you said you get get paid in the uk (which I am in rn) so basically I said "iN cAsH " not by the government as in like a ninja star flew in your window with an envelope containing £/$10.75 inside (I also know $10.75 isnt the same as £10.75 ) Another edit:WE REALLY GOT 667 LIKES LIKE-... thank you
That’s the cutest dog ever
I feel like I'm watching Nanny McPhee
Wom
Do a part 2
part 2
I looked at the title and I fucking thought it said ‘DAZ watches super fanny’
At the start it reminded me of the sound of music
“some kids gonna get dropped kick across the living room” 💀
Daz Is amazing I would never do anything bad to this man. Stay dazzling Daz! <3
Bruh I never got up from the naughty corner. I knew the moment I tried I would be slapped. And I wasn’t trying to get my mum pissed off.
I love your channel and how I know this is cus everytime I watch  your channel after a video I laugh so hard I feel like puking      GREAT SUCCESS
at least you had the shiniest shoes
0:19 Wholesome content
Put them for adoption:)
Ik no one will see this but i myself love knowing daz is teaching this generation (the daz generation no matter the age) how to stop and smile. Laugh and joke around, but every now and then he gives us future parent advice XD
If I was the nanny I would drop kick all three children
Mom: No Kid: FYA Daz: I’m not seeing any dad here. 7:19
Just warm their little butts up. That'll straighten them out!
This is why you smack your kids once in a while to remind them who the alpha is
Child: NO-  Ad: *Here’s three reasons why you might be addicted to stress*
Daz your doggie is adorable but his eyes are looking irritated is that normal?
Dad went to get milk cause screw raising them kids
Who knew 4 year old kids can shape up and throw hands and scream and sound like a parot
The biting thing happened to me! I bit my mum, and did it again even after she told me not to, and so she bit me back and I never did it again!
I really enjoyed this episode 😊, a lot of real worth while topics raised around Parenting. Well said Daz. And omg, my sons lvl3 autism non verbal. How hasn’t that mother collapsed yet?
I love his dog
“she’s a full time mum and punching bag it’s stressful”
That kid 4 year old needs some Nap Time
Ah naw he lost some respect from me after he said to try to be their if she gets an unwanted pregnancy
“One episode in and you won’t want kids ever” me looks at my son oops to late lol
IKEA couch 😂🤣
The boys beating his mom up?  He takes after his DADDY
1000% as soon as those cameras stopped rolling she clouted the lot of them
The fact that our dogs look the exact same is scary and disturbing-
Gizmo looks like Iggy tbh
4:12 is just. Just straight up funny
I’m a single mom of 5 and I can not explain how sad I feel for this mom. Overwhelmed over stressed and no end in sight. This breaks my heart ❤️ THANK YOU DAZ FOR BEING COMPASSIONATE I SAW THAT TEAR!
see my cousin did that to my aunty and my mom whooped the shit out of him now he won't ever do it again and at that point i would've just left him at a adoption center
I was impossible and now i still am 😆
It doesn't matter if she doesn't want you around
'ive watered you'  gizmo is plant confirmed
‘Pull my hair back and put me in blue.’ -Daz, 2021. 😭😂

Him talking about getting a girl pregnant but I'm a femboy

Letting kids act like the authority is not okay she is the mom and she is the authority like it or not
YOUR DOG LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE MY AUNTIE KERRY'S DOG-
I respect this man
I HATED the naughty step and my parents would put me on it when I'd done nothing wrong just to see my reaction...
Wait does daz watch anime??? I heard him say super saiyan😆
7:09 Not a screw driver, that’s a dart…
6:36 I would NEVER hit my mom. I would be 😵 if I did
I stabbed my brother with a pencil in the stomach it didn’t break skin luckily 👁👄👁 I also bit
My Latina mom: ay la chancla va cantar
My 3 nephews act just like the little boy and it's horrible

The Dad is probably dead
lol hey daz ur so funny
The first bit is the de la reveló su
I feel like I would be able to fit a baguette in between Gizmo’s eyes and he would still be able to see round corners-
awww gizmo
I'm gonna say it if I was the mom I'm sending those kid to the adoption agency or even better I'm going go get milk...
Fun fact I was almost on this show but when they called us my parents canceled for reasons unknown and now I’m a completely good person 😀
Rip door
11:29 "Kiss my willy" did nobody else spot that?
**starts video with regular intro** "BIRTH CONTROL!"
Just use a belt
MY MOM DID THE SAME FOR THE BITING THING OMG! it worked for me too! 😂💕💕
My parents called it “time out” and I would no stay still and step off the step and I would sit on the floor until the notice
Imagine the kids from that episode watching this thinking ffs 🥲
My dad beat me a few times and those times were enough to straighten me out
Gizmo needs his own channel for his bday :)
Simple solution: Whoop them
Reese is my name, I love the name Reese, hehe thanks for saying my name!! Ur my fav YouTube!🥳
Me and my siblings were the worst as little kids, I threw a freaking trash can at my little brother for crying out loud 😂 But our mom is so good at parenting that our dad who was never around, he was not needed. True sometimes we pushed mom to the edge of her limits. For instance when she realised how bad smoking was for her health and decided to quit, she told us this straight away. Why it was bad for her and we listened, sucked it in like a sponge. She used that info as a parenting trick later on. We would be fighting again and she'd just say something like "If you won't behave I swear I'm going out and taking a long hard puff out a cigarette". We would drop it immediately and 'try to stop' her from leaving the house, even if she wasn't actively trying to walk to the door. She quit smoking in half a year from her decision and we get along quite nicely nowadays. She never hit us either. Our mom is an incredibly patient woman, I've never seen her blow a fuse but I feel like we were pretty damn close to that multiple times growing up. She's one of those mom's that bottle it up and let it all out when it counts. I love her dearly and I'm learning to say it out loud to her 🥺
Afrikaans kids:😮🤐😲😲😲😶😶
afrikaans kids watching this Afrikaans kid:nee man i'd be dead Id get a bliksem
Get the dog a chair so he can be in the videos
Nah cause knowing my siblings the whole time she’s there we’d act like angels until she leaves
She talks to them like they’re adults, they can’t rationalise being spoken to like adults, also where are they learning all these swear words? She doesn’t know how to discipline them properly. Kids are only a product of their parenting. I bet it’s hard being on her own and not knowing what to do. I imagine it can be really hard and sometimes you are so tired and over it that you don’t make the best choices. She just needed some guidance
Parents that are too afraid to hurt their kids feelings by disciplining them really piss me off. It’s more and more common these days. No parent is perfect but it’s not that hard to put a kid in their place. If you can’t figure that out then you’re fucked lol. Also your story about your mum is so funny haha I remember doing similar things and then being terrified being caught out. My mum is a primary school principal so you can imagine my upbringing lol. Also I don’t even remember using swear words until I was like 11-12. Some kids be wild.
I do have my tea
Daz's smile is very contagious
Lined up Like nazi’s 😂😂😂😂😂😂
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
Hey daz ur amazing and i love u 🥺🥺🥺 TY for making my days better
Hey love ur channel! But mind telling me any tips because im new? Anyway iur videos are really funny😂
If I did that to my mum I may as well die
On 10:00 is where it made me laugh so hard lol
“And before you say it i am that lonely single man with a dog” Daz is a moon
Can we have more giz
that is effective.
Omg at 5:30 it looked like you were talking about my life
My mom with 2 teens and 2 babies
kasey is relatable 12:52
LOL😂
Dose she know the odoption center is a thing
I died when he said something about the hair I just died
He literally made a video called: I let my girlfriend look at my comments
once my mom took my ipad and i got mad so i threw all the shoes off the shoe rack and my mom tripped on them now i feel bad
i would just pick up the child by the arms and throw it
You made me laugh so hard I almost tour my muscle for squeezing it to hard
They inherited the cussing of Gordon Ramsey
My mama would've slapped my ass all the way to hong kong lol.
I should be super nanny pull my hair back and put me in blue NOW 😂
'' Damn '' casually sips tea 🫖
You think anime’s have the coldest death stare 8:59 nooo moms have the deadliest death stares
Hey daz  I sorry I haven’t been watching your videos for a while
PUG!
That is my dog but his name is dolf
daz: How can we make a british nanny LOOK like a british nanny, Put that hair back SO tight that the scalp is bearly holding on.                                                                                                                                           this is why i love daz 🤣
Love the dog dude i am a huge fan😎😎😍😍😀😀
I don't even do the naughty spot with the kids I babysit. If they're fighting over something I take it away for a minute and have them calm down. Works everytime, same with explaining why the behaviour isn't nice while not fighting fire with fire. Idk, that's just me
Best tv show ever I fear
The naughty stair 😃💀
I had that aswell i bit my mum once and she bit me back and i never bit anyone ever again
all 3 of those little fUks  would get the belt, my  hand, and my foot, until the police came for me.. beat that a$$!!!
i also have a dog named gizmo lol
The liked to disliked ratio is insane!
If the babysitter from bossbaby was in real life
this was posted on my birthday i feel like my profile pic
I thought that speech you gave was really considerate…as a child who never knew their parents I think it’s kind to think that ur trying to stop this…and so with that, thank you Daz ❤️
The little boy had a dart that you use on a dart board
I loved how I asked where did gizmo go last video and we see him now😂
My friends parents used a condom and her mom was on birth control. And they still had a kid
I definitely couldn’t do this, I’d just put him up for adoption and I’d be laughing at him the little shit.
Only day can turn a two and a half minute video into a 16 minute video
I tried this a couple of times, let's say that my mother's look made me never dare again
I know so many girls that have has kids to just claim money as a single mum when they actually still lve with their boyfriends and earning decent money,  get annoyed at this as all i can afford is a room n a shared house doing 50 hours a week at work. ps: i do feel so bad for this woman as she clearly gets some serious abuse from her kids and they need to be sorted so she can actually live a decent life
Reece stands on the table and just goes ahhhhhhhhhhhh cracked me up when he said that
U think that’s bad? My niece stabbed my mum in the arm with a big piece of glass (she smashed her mirror out of anger and grabbed the glass) she’s 9 and has autism, adhd and something else that’s bad but forgot what it’s called
“Before you ask, yes I am that lonely man with a dog” 🤣😂 got me laughing
petition to make daz super nanny  👉🏼👉🏼
*snorts birthcontrol* yeh i'm not having kids
"AND ALSO MY BOOT" LMFAO
The ending message <3
My mum when I was a child: “sit on the naughty step” Me at 16: *sits on the stairs all the time for no reason whatsoever*
Da dogge is so cuuuuuet!
Daz your dog is dazzling!!! so cute!!
DAZ I HAVE A DOG CALLED GIZZY (cos he didn’t suit gizmo) and I call him GIZ. This has made me very happy 😂😍
watching one born every minute is a pretty good contraceptive 😆
If my kid has that behaveour they would be standing up for a whole month becouse of the beating 😂
Once I was saying stuff and talking back to my mom and them she went to smack my mouth I ducked and I realized I was introuble
"BIRTH CONTROL" i spat my fuckin coffee out holy shit
Please watch more super nanny  🤣
I never knew u had a daughter daz
We must see more.
Your fantastic Daz x
What did the dad do to the mom that the kids picked up on😟 Like the son and his hitting
"I've took you on a walk, I've fed you, I've watered you"  sorry hunny, I need to go water the dogs. I'll be back!
Thank you :)
The “put that kid in a MNA ring” got me LAUGHING 😂
Who does she love them
Alternative title: Daz becomes supernanny
What a catch though
I got this recommended to me from the newest video, meaning it wasn't in my feed when it was uploaded, even with the bell set to All. And Daz starts with a cute puppo. YouTube...you'd better work on your site, because I WILL NOT ACCEPT missing out on this type of content again!
Hahahah hahahaha
Is It just me or is he swearing in the thumbnail
if i would have done that i would've got my ass whipped so hard I wouldn't be able to sit normally for a week
Never leave the women if she's pregnant... what if I never slept with her?
I showed my mom this, and introduce her to this. And about two months later, she watched it and showed it to me and made it look like she introduced it to herself. And I told her "mom I was the one that showed you this" and she said that I didn't. So it went back and forth because I told her that I did show and introduce her to Supernanny. And till this day she doesn't believe me.
The kids are defo got a constract with the camera man to act like ots wwe😭😭😂
i never acted like that with my momma
2:20 God they're hiding the devil aren't they!
I would be killed if I was 1 of the kids
jiz the dog
the camera man: O-O
Giz? More like Gizmo from Gremlins ;)
asian mums could never
my mom watched super nanny and still decided to have me 💀
Did your shoe certifics say  your shoes were dazzling
This man still runs YouTube 😂😭
GIZMO IS ADORABLE
Ha I went to the same school as those kids 😂
He
The boy was throwing a pencil with those big fluffy ends not a screwdriver
its satan from the womb!Jesus Christs!😂🤣
11:28 did he say "Touch my willy" 😃
Can you please react to dhar mann
Wait i didnt know daz was single
Giz is so cute
Thank you daze I’m a 12 year old boy and thank you for the massage about the possibilities of having kids
If I ever acted like that, I would be dead
“Look at joe jus standing there in the corner” *zooms in* “jus like a curtain” Got me 😭😭 4:43
I think the boy has adhd
Yk I don't believe in the ass whooping method but in these type of situations its sometimes the answer
Giz is so cute
Mate, you made me laugh so much you made me spill my tea.
My cat is named gizmo and we call her giz as well
You know here’s what if I was the mother I would just be the stern mother I would turn to them say nothing and give them the eye
Ive seen super nanny
Gizmo’s eyes hold much wisdom.
SURRENDER THAT DOGGGG NOWWWWW
If I behaved even a FRACTION like that, I would have faced the insane wrath of a German grandmother. The sheer coldness of a disappointed German grandmother's stare is enough to scare ANYONE into line.
Gizmo is so cute 🥰
Daz wondering where's the dad             Me :A he's getting the milk or the children sacrifice him
I would kill the children
Cute dog
Best thumbnail In existence 11/10
That's  my dogs name Giz
14:20 got me like “don’t drop your crown king”
my special talent is not being scared by the 'mom death stare' mainly cause i dont have a mum but not the point
can you please react to the tallentless writer
I love daz hes to funny
“Kids going super sain” nYAHHhhHhhH
Apparently when I was put in the corner I would sit there quietly and calmly because I knew I could get out faster that way.
i slowed it down its a dart
CAN I EAT YOUR DOG PLEASE
I'm watching this with my mom and she agreed with with whole look thing 😂
this reminded me to take my birth control
I’m sorry Daz you need to watch the American Supernanny. Those kids are a bit worse…
9:20 I got stressed when u did it
Daz what i would do if my kid ever through there toys at me i would put them away in tell i think theve learnt there lesson
“WhOleSoMe cOnTeNt”
DAZ   GAMES   @
He took the words right out of my mouth 0:31
is that a jojo reference?
THE DOG ISSSS SOOOO CUTEEEEEE <33333
Hehe he has 6.9 mil suns
“THESE KIDS ARE SATAN 👺
I thort I was watching super nanny but no wwe hell in a sell
Gizmo looks high
gizmo!!!!!!! so freaking cute! i just treated a dog that looks exactly like him today at work! .....poor nugget had an ear infection!...also if my kid said nothing...they would get nothing.  grew up in a big italian family...you talk back like that or act disrespectful....you would be screwed haha
Can you please do more episodes of supernanny
the mom  is wrong by not beating the crap out  of them kids
I bit kids when I was 2, mother bit me and I realised it hurt....so i pushed them over instead!
Watch gacha heat
Adorable puppy so cute
YES PLEASE WATCH WIVE SWAP
They should know Reesie montage
I need someone to have Daz quotes on the poster.
Daz is like are online father always teaching us lessons in every single video! We all love Daz and we are super grateful to have him in our lives!
11:27 the kiss ma willy had me in stitches 😂😂😂😂
but didnt you have a girl friend
Those kids need a hiding, with like a wooden paddle or spoon or something. My dad used to give me thrashings lmao, and I'm grateful for it cause flip, those taught me my lessons well.
If we moved from the notty spot we got another spanking and more time lol better to be bored out of your minds thinking about how to apologize to your siblings than another spanking or worse a talk from dad when he got home from work. 😅😂
5:32 His piranha career just got ended by his mum
The tiny child will probably survive 29 gun shots to the head
0:00 Iggy is that you
9;13 i legit trembled when you did that
Can you react to .how to basic
White parenting 😐
The exact middle finger situation happened to me when I was younger. She just gave me that deathly stare and I was frozen in shock, completely petrified as I lowered my hands and apologized right on the spot
If I would of acted like this or even close my mother would have beat my ass 7 ways from sunday these kids need to have their asses beat and put through some serious pt
Gone are the days where it was acceptable to slap your kid on the arse. Kids these days would get away with murder.
Man I am crying laughing you are just 😂😂😄😄😂😂god
Give me an hour and 2-3 belts then ill make those kids the kindest kids u will ever met
I will never not laugh at Peter Kay’s Super Nanny sketch. 😂
wait him and his girlfriend broke up 😭
12.53  Only me who. Thought she was going to throw him in the water
I remember when I was on holiday with my friend and her 6 year old brother was loosing at a game and he went to get a hair dryer and plugged it in under my chair and started trying t o shoot me with said hair dryer
I got the best sleeper certificate that was the only certificate I ever got and that was in 6 th grade 😅
if it were me i would be the worst parent those children would experience hell i would lock the door and turn off the lights and turn them on red then i would tie some long black coat with a black hat and i would tie a belt with a whip on them
my mom could have used Jo Frost cause holy shit my brother was a monster
all i have to say is.. PUPPY!
That door is more indestructible than a Nokia blokia
So where’s the games??!?
slap reese until he stops
Omg I have been watching you forever how did I not know you have a baby Boston. So do I she is 7 months old and the love of my life how old is yours?
Daz 🖕🖕🖕 Daz mum.: Player Daz... Eliminated...
Just look at the dislikes and likes u can't hate daz he's the best
That dog is legit iggy
1 Where is the dad? 2 Where is the belt?  I know people have an issue with spanking, if you do it and explain to them why it is happening then they will associate the punishment with the bad action. Sadly most parents who spank their kids get this bot wrong and just dull out the punishment, when that happened kids will think they did nothing wrong and the parent just hates them.
0:11 what kind of dog is that- it looks like a boxer and a French bulldog mixed together
Please keep your dog in your videos !!!!
i can't stop laughing  😂
wtf am i watching hahaha
I got and achievement point bc I pushed a chair under the desk 😭😭😂😂
I love how the oldest one us just quiet and eating. Cuz she learned her lesson to dare ever do that 🤣😂😂
GIZMOOOOO
The council estate version of mrs doubtfire😭😭😭
Did he say he was single ? Daz, how the hell are you single ? You are awesome
I hope you do more of these, (if possible a full episode would be great clips are good too though). Really enjoyed thanks!
Daz is so inspirational
Nothing is more serious when your parents or anyone goes “we need to have a serious talk”
So true ever since I saw my first episode I've never wanted kids😄
forget all these nanny's they need nanny mcphee lol
watch the world's strictest parents next lol
I can’t lie when I was a kid and my sister bite me and I had teeth marks on my arm and it was red and I have anger issues when I was younger I bite my sister back and left a bruise on my sister it was there for a few days and I was the only one that got in trouble for it but in the end she never did it again
if that family had an egyptian arab mom they would be dead before they even contiue their sentance
sarah has an amazing dad 💛
My cats called gizmo😂
Thank God I don't have kids, and if they ever behaved like that they asses are gonna feel like and the bedroom would be the only thing they would be seeing for a while.
We need more of this
my mom made me sit on the stairs for 7 minutes at least. i never. ever. got up.
At mine it's only my mother and 4 kids including me lol it's not great
If these kids lived in a poly household trust they wouldn't be like that after that week🤣 they would've gotten the hidings of their lives
Daz Plays Gta 5
I had the naughty step when I was little. I knew I could leave but the only thing keeping me there was the pure fear of my parents (my dad mainly). Like sometimes I would go a step or two up but would be extremely anxious I would get yelled at for leaving the step.  Now I cry whenever someone yells at me. Now I don’t throw tantrums I just have severe anxiety
9:09 she didn’t have to punish me I just knew 9:29 I didn’t have a PlayStation for two weeks
When my mom was young, her older sister also had a biting habit. My grandma taught her the hard way why she shouldn't bite people by biting her hand so hard she drew blood. My grandma is the sweetest lady you'll ever meet, but she happens to not understand her own strength. For an older lady she's pretty strong lol
I didnt have a time out area,me and my brothers would be put on our knees and if our nose wasn't touching the wall then we would get longer. Once I add to kneel on dry rice for like 10 mins
13:45 So glad that Daz acknowledges the struggles for women and is giving advice to men to better them! Thank you Daz!
No don't pull your hair back where the tea party hat
I swear he starts 80% of his videos with a hilarious opening then end with the deepest lectures. it's hilarious
Daz: I don’t see a dad) my mind be like a Nother fatherless child
9:18 OH GOD THE LOOK. TELL ME WHY IT LOOKS JUST LIKE MY MUM'S LOOK OMG
Das: hand cuff HIM!!!!!
Yes the look is real tho
This is why I'm a lesbian...
Awww adorable dog ❤
No Daz the scariest thing about my mum  is the flip flop
i absolutely love this reaction. do more supernanny reactions please!!!❤️❤️
Why does Daz have Iggy
Bunny funnt
This episode must've aired a while ago, meaning the kids must be older, and more manageable. But by any miniscule chance that little boy is the same all these years later, that mom needs to run. Because a four year old can hit hard, but not hard enough to seriously hurt you. But if he still does this in present time, I'm afraid that he may legitimately knock her out.
Super nanny are all acted none of those are real
5:04 is definitely my brother.
For christ sake just give them a love tap on the bum
Doing what your kids do to you back work trust me
my sister got put on the naughty spot when we were younger and she had a piece of cheese with her. She got so bored she put her cheese there and starting telling it off saying 'naughty cheese'
Daz is right there to many dads who leave there children im one of them my dad left when my mom found she was pregnant II never met him but i alwaya swore that bc of him if i ever have. A child I'll bevthe father he wasnt no matter how gars it will be and k think other guts should do the same stay there for ur child
Asian kids be like: Yeahhh… I choose life
IGGY ZA FOLDA
If I hit my parents I be knocked out like Mike Tyson just fuckin socked me one
i understand what you mean by dont run off be a dad and everything but when a man and a girl are having s3x they both took the decission to do it.  so its 50/50. after that the girl if she dont want the baby can just abord it and the men dosent have a word to say... i think it would be ok to that if a women want a baby but the men dosent then he could just go and never come back. its 50/50 they both made the decision. anyway no children should not have a dad or a mom.
I’ve never seen the super nanny in the British version lol
What’s interesting to me is that he said that they don’t teach in schools the fact that a baby can always happen even with protection, and it’s quite funny because my school did the exact opposite, and I remembered that from my health class in high school
I was raised with a Military Dad so I would’ve been killed😭
Daz always has good content
Listen mate im aussie and if I even said shut up. I would be aborted at bloody 15.
Its the rare boggle eyed panda at the start of the video
I was an absolute demon when I was little, I was always super tame with people outside of the family cause I knew respect but no one inside the house was safe
Serious question how far do u rekin u could kick that 4 yr old if my child even attempts to bit me I will go aguroooo in him
That’s why there is something called a BLOODY HEAD LOCK
#giveusapart2
Jo frost is a national icon.
I remember the norty step I ran once didn't help
😂😂😂😂😂😆
Like Lil Nazis :)
The Mom death stare is exactly like you showed
Can I take your dog please I will bring him/her back
“THATS NAUGHTY 👹👹👹”
Claim your entertainment right now here.
the tittle should be Daz's lesson:sex education
your dog is soo fucking cute and you and your dog are really funny lol
Does daz not have a wife/gf anymore
He’s so cute omg I’m new to ur fandom!!!
In the us we use somthing called the corner now if u were sent to the corner and you left this would be the only image in the after life 🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐🖐
when i did something bad as a kid i had to look at a wall standing up straight for 30 minutes
What supernanny was just an effort to keep down the population
I did not have tea I have lemonade
Cutest dog ever I would totally follow Gizmos Account <3
I’ve never been viol
apparently i went on the naughty step once when i was a child and hated it so much i never acted out bad enough again lol
Saint Pious XII
Lmao the time I was four I didn’t think I could even speak, let a loan swear
WHERES LINDA
I like for the doggo 🥰
Heh, I can’t get anyone pregnant… I’m gay….
Daz is the kind of YouTuber that you think that you watched all his videos but then a video from 2 years ago comes up
2:00 omg lolll
My dog's name is gizmo too! He's 12 years old almost 13 in human years.
“Ive watered you” watering dogs 😍🥳🌸🌺🌼🌻🌷🌹
The nanny is just enjoying the view and sipping on tea and thinking what to do to help her 😃👍
0:01 I said aww for the longest time ever
If females get to choose weather baby lives or dies do men have a choice weather to pay child support??
Mental health is important too if you’re not mentally good for dealing with children then don’t
If I was like that boy , mom's hand would swing from one corner of the room and I'll be lying on the other corner of the room. God ! I do thing my mom's beating made me a realy good person as it wasn't a hard beating , she'll always give me anything I want from anything edible to toys , it's the bad behaviour my family can't tolerate.
“Some kids gonna get drop kicked across the living room.” -Daz 2021
I love Gizmo he’s such a character xx
“Blues unflattering in bulk”  Me after buying a blue tracksuit 😰
My grandma had this thing called “the corner” when me and my brother were little and we were staying with her she would make us stand in the corner for like 20 minutes if we got in trouble. We couldn’t talk, turn around or anything we just had to stand there and “think about what we did” and lemme tell you 20 minutes felt like HOURS and it’s safe to say I never wanted to get in trouble again after the first time I was punished to the corner
frenchie! run there is a wild daz behind you!
When I heard you talking about the naughty step that reminded me of my grandma. She used to put me on a step right outside the living room door, which was always shut, and I’d just get up and walk around. No one was watching me so why not.
My Boston terrier has died recently and it makes me happy to see one randomly while watching your video.  Hug him with the best of love from me x3
ill just push the kids in the river lol
daz should watch an entire episode of supper and or give us more gizmo content
Shall we bring back skate 3
My mom is the same🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
My sister got a trophy for having the healthiest teeth-  LIKE WHAT😭
Would love to see daz take super nanny’s place it would be hilarious
Actually! i got a puppy just recently, her name is rose and she's a lab, cane mix, 3 months ^^ just wanted to share..
When mums give you that look you say “I’m gonna die in 5 seconds”
If I even look at my mom with an attitude she will smack the shit out of me
My cats name is gizmo love it
0:00 IGGY IS ALIVE HE RECOVERED
The puppy looks ABSELUTELY  ✨dazzling✨
DAZ U SHOULD PLAY THE NEW LIFE IS STRANGE ITS SO GOOD
Moral of the story: never ever watch daz's videos while eating, you're gonna chok on your food while dying of laughter  Edit : MUM I'M FAMOUS!
If I swore at my mum I’d get my mouth washed out with soap
My dad would beat the shit out of us if we acted like that and I would completely understand
I love this video
1:15 you know I have my tea Daz. I was sipping it when you said that
And that’s why I 👩🏼‍❤️‍💋‍👩🏽
The only reason I watch super nanny is for the kids mis behaviours. Tbh I watch them and wonder all the time what would have happened if my mom saw me do this and seriously think abt weather or not I would have a funeral after this behaviour.
come on guys let’s get Daz to 7 million
I used to watch super nanny when i was 7. the nostalgic memories!
Use condoms
If I did any of this I would be wiped off the face of the planet even if I was 4
The look activates my fight or flight mode 👍🏻
From 8:16 to 9:29…… Daz YOU ARE SPEAKING FAX!!
Bitten by another mom😭😭😭
Yo ur funny asf but stop pausing the ting every 10 secs ffs it’s bare jarin 🤬🤣🤦🏽‍♂️
1:59 Wait, who’s Joe?
Lol that look is a frenchie thing lol.
Dude i have the same looking dog at home his name is max and he looks the same as yours😅
im surprised my aunt and her demon kids havent been on super nanny
You would get a funniest award
My parents used to scare me w these when I was kid, they’d tell me to behave or else they’d have to call her 💀
Gismo
Make him a channel
When I was a kid we would have had to sit in the corner and if we moved or turned around we'd stand if we did it again we'd have to put our hands on our head then we'd have to hold our hand straight forward
This. This is why I love Daz. His advice at the end of the video, is so real and I couldn't have said it better myself.  I've always taken precautions when having sex but I'd like to think if an unplanned miracle happened out of nowhere I could step up and be a Mum, if I can't do that then I shouldn't be having sex and the same goes for anyone else.
Super Nanny was what my Mum and I watched to see how good of a kid I was... I was an angel compared to some of the little monsters they had on the show!
13:45 Thanks Daz they actually dont say this in school so tysm it shows what we need to learn in school vs what we actually learn😁❤
Hey bro
Lol my dogs name is Gizmo to!!
We need more gismo
😒😒😒😒
Your dog is adorable
i'd get the milk
kill it
Certificate for snorting the most tea bags
BlOoDy JeSuS
I showed my mum the part where daz was talking about the “mum look” and she cracked up laughing because its so true
Bro if his biting me like that I’m hitting that kid across the face
that thing about getting someone pregnant, even if you dont want to be with the mum anymore, youve still gotta be there for the kids
me and my mom left my dad because he abosed me wean I was a baby so me and my mom left dad 😌
It’s the death stare bro
I would have none of that shit from my children. They’re getting locked in their room with no phones or iPads or anything for 24 hours with the exception of school. Keep gaming devices in communal areas like the living room and make sure they know how easy it is to take that away, permanently.
*pov: this is how todoroki's family became an idea for my hero academia* todoroki : mother...your a b word.. *rei turns around dramatically* rei : ENJI WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?!?!? todoroki : it wasn't him..it was you. i heard you on the phone calling dad the same word and i googled what it means, so i thought i'd use that to my defense..after all. "you can use your power anytime you'd like" you never said WHICH power. physically or figuratively in speech <\3
Also daz if both agree their is also other options rather than having the baby. Like giving it away or having an abortion
omg i love your dog!
I only found this channel a few weeks ago. I love the humour, but I love even more that daz is a good guy and isn't afraid to show it. He has respect for people and wants people to do the right thing, and uses his platform to encourage it.  My sister, like many other women around the world, had the baby daddy take off, and its heartbreaking to see how it affects mother and child. My niece is now 3 and I have stepped in as a father figure type role just so its something for her, so she can grow up with a couple of people (plus her nanny) loving and caring for her all the time. But some kids will never get that and its so sad, especially in situations where the mum can't do everything on her own.   So 100% what Daz says! If you don't want a baby, and if you get one you wont look after it, don't have sex. Its that simple. Contraceptives are never 100% fool proof, people don't believe in abortion, so thats the reality of sex. If you cannot step up and be a parent, why take part in an act which could result in life??
Stop my cat is called Gizmo
My Granpa, He was this big Soviet man, and let me tell you, I’ve heard story’s of him beating the hell out of my Dad
Who els the remember when he first told the mom story
Where is dad?
Daz: "Yes I am that lonely single man with a dog me: IT'S A FRENCHY!!!!!
“THATS NAUGHTY!!!!” Got me😂😂🤣
Daz gives speeches like he’s my dad 🥲
Uhhhhhhhh
DAZ IS THE NEW PARENTING TEACHER👏👏👏👍
This show gets crazy honostly...
I would have slap the shit out of thoes kide
OMG!!!! Your puppyyyyyy!!! SOOOOO CUUUUUTE😍🥰
if I ever kept my arm even in the 10cm radius of my mum's face, she would yeet me out of the galaxy let alone mumble swear words 😂
Him. I’m not mental  Me. Dies laughing
Make that dog a channel
when i was a kid. maybe 1 or 2. i was the easiest fuckin thing to take care of. all i needed was food. thats it. then im fast asleep. My mother even confirmed i didnt cry ONCE in my childhood. i just needed food. it was that simple. and then. i came to the playing age. I kid you not. I used to sit there for HOURS. were talking 7 or 8 hours a day. im sitting there on the floor rolling the wheels on my toy car. for 8 fucking hours a day. i swear to god. you could give me a fucking stick and i would find someway to play with it for the entire day.
2:05 if that we’re saluting
I’d put that little kid up for adoption tbh
Daz is only content when he's with his dog and you can definitely tell😂💀
bro she needs to yell at those kids their making me mad and they live across the earth 😭
When he did the middle finger while looking shocked he looked exactly like my cousin who I don't get to see often so it made me really happy
OMG ITS ACTUAL YOUTUBE
10:56 i would be sat on a step and i would sit there and play with something random of literally just take a nap of something i also used to hide a ipad at the top of the stairs so i would play
Hey daz I had a kid at 16 and it's great
Lot
i got a certificate for the mot infectious laugh in year 3 LMAO. and when my sister left high school she got a trophy for 'most likely to sleep through every important event in their life'
Man someone hand her a belt
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww, soooooooooooooooo cute. I love dogs! 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂I'm dying😂😂😂😭😭😭
My parents together weren't the best together. My dad was a druggie and beat my mom. He still yells (they were together 7-8 years ago) and punches holes in the walls  very rarely. My mom and him split and not they have partial custody of me. My mom is doing amazing now and is getting married on the 16th! My step-dad (I call him my better dad) is so nice. After Halloween my mom is going to try and get full custody! (Yay!!) That's all I wanted to say, idk if it's relevant to the video or not
When u said I’m a single man with a dog I thought u had Linda loll
You know what give me a show I swear to god my whole family whenever I come around make me teach the Psychotic children how to act normal and surprise surprise I don’t hit them IM 18 WHERES MY DAMN CHECK
Imagine the kids were just acting absolutely horrendous and then when the nanny actually started trying they acted perfect lmao
my mom used to lock me in my room
Daz: just some wholesome content  The thumb nail: 🖕
never get a girl pregnant until you are married!
My mom did the same thing when I bit her, she bit me. I didn't bite again
HOW CUTE IS YOUR DOGGO!
Daz your channel is thriving, I am weirdly proud of you even though you have no idea who I am. Saw you at the Edinburgh Fringe back in 2019 and am a long-time subscriber. Even though you only share small bits about your personal life, you've overcome so flipping much in your life and I just think you're such a bright light in the world. Keep doing you. 😎✨
That face at 9:17 gives me ptsd from when I was like 5😂
.
I would get my ass beat
😘🤟🏾🤑
The puppy looks like him tho
If I ever did anything like this, my dad would hold me over the banister 😂😂😂
future jonn cenas (i don’t know if i spelled that right)
I saw the title I had to click
“She’s got them all lined up…like little nazis.” -Daz Lovely

No way my dogs name is Gizmo to lol
FAQ OFF THATS NAUGHTY
14:57 this goes foe women as well, dont give him the child then run off.
Daz are you sure that’s shanking? (4:31)
I swear if I would hit my mum at that age I would have been left in the Woods at night.lmao
My favourite vid
3:49 that's me but I'll be saying *"do u want to be a bootlicker"* they ask *"wats a bootlicker"* *"here I'll show you"*and then I'll shove boot in his mouth. this is why I'll never have kids. I'll even cut my balls off
shortened sentence or freedom. haha
jesus christ! that kid can Throwww.
That dog seeing the past and future at the same time
3:50 You'll also get Daz's shinyest shoe/boot
Daz has mentioned the story where he flipped his mom off before. Somehow it was even funnier in this version
Or she
He looks like iggy from jojos bizarre adventure part 3
That dog looks familiar
Daz's mom watching this like: "mmhmm that's right Daz don't forget to clean your room"😂😂
why do all dogs look like there owners?!?
Watching 1 episode of supernanny makes me want to become the pope or some shiy
When my partner pisses me off all I have too do is giving a death stare not say nothing and he just goes (Imma go upstairs and leave you too calm down)😂 he knows me too well now I don’t argue I’ll just give u a death stare and you have 5 seconds too get from my view😂
daz sex ed,,
4:17 I’m crying😂😂😂
First daz video I've watched in a while It's a good day back
honestly, give a serious look and raise the back of your hand and the child will stop

I know this is a bit of a weird request, but could you do a Daz Watches on Niko Avocado?
Bl...oo...dy ... je...sus...
Why doesn't she just fucking yeet Emm they will shut up for a year
The usual reason children act like that is cause society hides violence away. Behind age restrictions. So when kids learn of violence they think they are cool and going agaisnt the system. Im not saying let kids watch violent movies but instead educate them on why violence is wrong. Cause i dont know about others but that was never  accually taught in school.
All it takes is one ass whoopin
I mean I had a friend that had 8 siblings and both parents were there so respect for the dad he stayed
Gizmo = Cuteness Overload <3
Pog
just punch it
Say that to my dad oh wait you can’t he’s in jail 🙄
Just like with Ramsey the ones filmed in Europe or GB are so different than the ones in the USA.
God bless spread the gospel
whats the dogs name dad daz we have one just like it
I like getting drop kicked too daz haha🤣🤣
Mom: you need to eat  Boy: okey *bites his mom* 🤣
MORE SUPERNANNY VIDEOS!!!!!!
No one will ever convince me that having children is nice
I cant help but remember the  South park parody of super nanny with cartman lol ..... Also screw the mother , i feel sorry for the neighbours who have have to live next to that shit .  Found it , south park parody  https://youtu.be/IjURPLsOF34
More education I have ever learnt at school
😯 what the hell.
Amazing reaction
YouTube is dressed  like a IKEA  couch
Please play tall poppy
I can’t believe you did this  Super nanny is supreme
Lining up like little Nazis 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“Pull my hair back and put me in blue” I don’t need to say why that was amazing we all know it is
Look so much like my Boston terrier
what I hate about superananny is that Jo dresses like a nightmare teacher and then after she observe she dresses more casually like wtf, just pick an outfit already
YouTube make me verified so I can become to deceiver
i had a naughty step and some times i put myself on it
the way that my brother is way worse 😭
i can tell how Daz is just ready to hit the child that is the worst and send them back to hell
I agree with Daz with the dad thing. As someone who dad got up and left for a different family and actually cared but left my mom then got sent to prison, a father is a good thing to have :£
I got a certificate for best beard once xD
Please do more super nanny😭😭😭😭
As always your videos are amazing
Omg daz’s dog has the same name as mine
Got me mug in hand and hat on head
It honestly works, I bit my sister when I was little and my mum bit me back, never again did I do it.
If she was an arabic mom the children will be gone
God bless the Arab household,one hit and YOURE DEAD
0:00OMG THAT IS THE CUTEST THING EVER
Those last few words dam touched my heart strings it’s so powerful
Hey, Daz. Could you react to Gacha? I know this is late, but seriously, you’d get a kick out of it.     Fr Gacha is… something else.
I love daz
That dog is the perfect fit for daz…..idk why but it does.
My mum has three kids, an ars of an ex husband (my dad, which lasted less that a year, bye) and a lot of experience with shity boyfriends that like to come and go. Shes a great mum though, and I couldn't ask for more. She's awesome in her own fierce, loving mum way. (Sorry, my mum's just really amazing to talk about)
I want to see them do the Crip walk
THE dad is out buying some milk
it takes two to make a child
Is it just me or at 4:25 the nanny looks like the oh air guy from the lorax XD
I PUSH MY MOTHER ON REFLEX WHEN SHE'S ABOUT TO HIT ME CUZ REFLEXES AND I GET SENT UP IN THE MOUNTAINS FOR A MONTH AND THIS KIDS PUNCH, KICK AND BITE THEIR MOTHER AND SHE'S LIKE "*as lowercase as possible* don't kick your sister don't kick me 🧍‍♀️"  I would be honestly praying for my soul.
So this talent/personality void, just bullies famous people for clicks? Wow, he's stunning & brave...
Who pins shit I there FUCKING cabinet
I’d be like Johnny Lawrence from Cobra Kai “QUIET!!!!”
Jo Looks like a curtain
iggy
Rarity: Gizmo on Daz Games 😇☺️
Daz is such a great human being.
These kids are SATAN ! LOL
After finding Daz earlier this year I can honestly say after figuring out his morals and how he is as a person. He is 100% my favorite YouTuber. He never fails to put a smile on my face and also teach me a few life lessons. He’s like a cool father figure or that one dope uncle. This man deserves all the good things coming to him
You should have 1000 mil subs omg yes
ion know how she doesnt beat the fuck outta them
Dude is four tho like, if I swore at my mum at 4 and I would not exist right now I think
Only OGS can subscribe
Lessss gooooo I love DAZ watches, easily best series from daz
Honestly daz the only certificate I got was from I went on a french trip in year five and it was a certificate for being the most unorganised kid in year five.
Is it weard that my scotish Mum stopped the car after I bit my older sister when I was one, and fearsly grabed my arm and bit it. Not as hard but still painful and we still talk about it to this day  ps love you daz you make my day.
why you watering the dog??? its not gonna grow that way
"dressed like an ikea couch" LMFAO
i been waiting for thissss
the look
Id like a sketch of daz as supernanny please
I remember watching daz when he had 300k subs. Now he's about to reach 7 million.  And I couldn't be prouder 🥰
I swear if even threatened to hit my mum she would give me a good smack
Good pup
Life advise with daz
i'd put the oldest and the youngest up for adoption within two seconds
i would actually watch super nanny daz seems so fucking funny to me lmaooo
I’d vote for Daz for prime minister
Your dog is adorable 😍💕💖❤💗
When I was little my aunt made me stand on my tippy toes with my nose on the wall with my hands as high as i could reach and if my hands came down the timer restarted
when he talks about the risks of pregnancy and about people stepping up my respect for him went 📈📈📈
Not hard but hard enough to go 5:27
I'm just waiting for the super Nanny to comment hahaha
If I did this stuff as a kid I could expect grandmas slipper to come flying at my head full pelt.
If these were my kids I'd have slapped them so hard they'd see loading screen for the hospital
My name is Reece and I was a lot like this kid when I was little. Except I didn’t use my mom as a punching bag..
My sister had a fish named gizmo and he always looked angry cause his mouth moved like he was yelling
omg the third girl HAS MY NAME GIVE IT BACK
I'm not gonna lie, that ending part where Daz spoke about guys stepping up and taking responsibility made me emotional. I'm in a serious long term relationship. We're 17 nearly 18, been together 3 years. I had a pregnancy scare a month or two ago and another one recently.  We spoke about what we'd do if it ever happened, my boyfriend straight up admitted he'd become a deadbeat. He'd leave me because he wouldn't be ready. The only way he wouldn't break up with me is if I got an abortion (not happening) or we were 25, living together and both had stable incomes. Which I understand his fear, I understand why he would do it. But I personally think it is incredibly selfish, and I'd hope he'd take responsibility. We've spoken about kids names, we're technically engaged (neither of us can afford a ring) and we want to settle down with eachother. It hurts to think that if I make a mistake it's over. I just wish I could tell him that it's not my fault, if it happens I don't choose it. That it's just as scary for me and now there's the added pressure of telling him and either breaking up with him first or waiting for him to do it. Which I don't think I have the strength for either.  It's terrifying and I hope that you guys out there step up for your partner because it's not just your life on the line. Don't be selfish and be there to fucking support.
The one time it got legitimately violent between me and my brother I had the wind knocked out of me. My dad in turn knocked the wind out of my brother to let him know how painful and panicking it is. Never got hit in the chest or that violently again
13:40 good thing I’m a homosexual 😎
The show award daz got 💀
I showed this to my dad and he was smacking his lips the whole time. He said bend them over and spank em and they won’t do that anymore.
His ears look like rubber
Parent tip : hit your kids
DAZ ALSO HAS A BOSTON TOO???
That 4yr old kid is gonna be sorry when his mom takes her last breath.
haha you have 6.9(1)million subscribers. im shitting bricks.
Doggo is cool.
If that was my kid I would have the belt on all day and throw them in the basement whenever they get me mad
“And joe frost is dressed like an ikea couch 🥰” - Daz
or when she talks with her teeth closed and only moves her lips
I have a revalation! Discipline! a.k.a. smack the living souls outta ur children
If I get a girl pregnant I’m just gonna die. I’m gay so if I manage to get a girl pregnant I’ll just die. And won’t be on purpose I’ll just combust
the amount of story times in this video are incredible
"I fed you, I watered you" DAZ ITS NOT A DAMN PLANT
5:37 - Joe Rogan “OH WATCH THE TRIANGLE WATCH THE TRIANGLE”
I'd love to see my little brother on this show lmfao
Mini black
WHOOP👏🏽THAT👏🏽ARSE👏🏽🤬
My mother would’ve smacked the shit outta me if I acted like that
That look is your mom sizing up you for your coffin 😂😂
Nothing is scarier than a stern mom. You are correct Daz, my mom scared the absolute crap out of me she got upset.
You should just make "Low Disc Space" a co-host in every video from now on..
I used to watch Nanny 911 when I was younger, and from then on I’ve decided that I don’t want kids lol
*AHHH HE’S BITING!*
be careful with that red eye in the dog, my dog had one and got his eye removed as it was a form of cancer
👁️👃👁️      👄
It the I fed you I watered you 😭😅
I miss watching Daz. I used to watch him religiously when I was a kid, and I sorta forgot about him. It’s only now that I’m rediscovering that he is one of the last funny youtubers ever.
When my mom would be really mad she would give a freaky ass smile. Not her real smile but it's a mask that told me to "fucking run."
my ex left me with 2 kids and now I am about to have my 3rd baby I have a 2 yr old a 9 month old and about to have a newborn next yr and it's hard on me bc my oldest like to hit me and her sister and I have so much stress on me and I can't do anything there dad cheated on me to be with someone that didn't have kids and and he put it "skinnier and wasn't big" I was 8 months pregnant with my 2nd kid when he left me for the 2nd time now I have a guy that is helping me out but still he goes to work and then I am home alone with 2 kids and pregnant so it's hard on me
Idk bout y'all but Im terrified of my mother at times like she won't hesitate to give me a big ass bald spot
daz is literally the smartest man i know- istg i learn all my life lessons from this channel ToT
The only two things that are scarier than the silent stare are if you’re mum calls you by your full name or starts speaking another language. The amount of fear I feel when my mum starts speaking French, and the fear she felt when her nana spoke Gaelic… You will hightail it out of that room and go do what you were asked.
I’m dying 💀
I don’t condone child violence… but if they be kicking you, slapping you, screaming at you, then they gonna get fucking beat
i would make his head go “around the world and around the world”
BRUH I HAVE NEVER WANTED TO SEE A VIDEO SO BAD TBAN THIS
It’s a Boston Terrier, it’s so cute
When the kid goes in a MMA ring vs Connor mcgreggor: hitmarker sound “NOM NOM BITCH ILL BITE U”
If you like this, you'll get a kick out of "it's me or the dog" (personally I enjoy the dog phycology aspect of the episodes)
Meanwhile giz at the beginning of the video 👁👄👁➡️
Tell you what when your kids act like that. Wack em with a belt a few times
Sat in the trolley did he tell her to kiss his willy ....it's not funny but at the same time amazing 😂😂😂
When I was a kid I would bite and my mom bit me
I used to love this show so much when I was little!
me: if they were black tho ;)
awww that dog is adorable!!!!
Maybe the dad went to get some milk. I'm sure he'll be back. Right... RIGHT???
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSS
Seeing this reminds me of the short story The New Mother by Lucy Clifford who was widowed with two children and quite possibly wrote the story to scare her kids into behaving properly. In the story, the kids start misbehaving and the mother warns them that if they keep at it, then she'll leave and the monstrous New Mother will take her place. Eventually, that does happen, she leaves, and New Mother appears with glass eyes and a wooden tail. The kids run from the house in fright and they stay in the forest, surviving off of berries. Their real mother never comes back and New Mother lives in the house from then on.
the person you need is nanny mcphee
Daz you are wonderful !!
*MY DOGS CALLED GIZMO TOO, DAZ! FROM THE GREMLINS, RIGHT?*
once i stood on my mums toe didnt see my will u for a week
That’s why I’m lesbian😌
My mom did that to my brother when he bit someone
Cutest dog everrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Ok in the being of the video did I just saw iggy ? from JOJO BIZARRE ADVENTURE that pretty cool
When the kid bit his mum I thought fuck there is another Luis Suarez about
@12:52 I legit thought she was just gonna chuck her kid in the pond lol
Yeppppppppppppppppp
Im still waiting for daz to react to nikocado avocado
Nobody asked, but i'm eating grapes right now
Did you know you can look at anything and know what it would feel like to lick it
He should react to Gabbie hannah
Gizmo looks so confused
daz has the same dog as me and man did that just complete me
Who remembers Linda!!! 🥺🥺
the comment about it being very common to have lots of kids to get housing is actually a media myth, I suggest reading up on the topic of WHY the government/media WANT to spread that narrative (to anyone interested in the topic)
Lil-Gizmo is so cute!!
Hi mine fuhrer
Omg the dog at the start 😍
And she doesn’t look super
0:20
daz says literally everything i’m thinking it’s insane
Wait i thought u were married with a kid?!
No
Bruh I looked up your age bc I was like “what? When his daughter was growing up? How old is this guy?” And I can’t believe you’re 36 bro you look like you’re 24
This is why I want to love alone when I'm older.
My grandma  dog died she had 3 dogs  but one dog died and my grandma   buyed a new dog and his name is gus and he is a Boston  terrier  and he is a baby
Daz “I bet that there are kids who have gotten the better of her.” Me thinking about the super nanny from South Park
All lines up like little nazis 😂
Brown parents are a blessing
had a dog called gizmo
I feel so bad for Casey I know exactly what she feels like.
Beat tf out of your kids and it won’t happen
I remember being 5 and doing something bad and my mum  would put me on the naughty step and I was like I.p can go but I had to wait for the number of my age 😂😂
More super nanny reaction plz❣️❣️❣️❣️
Are you Daze are you Daze are you Daze
I wonder if the kids really act like that or if its just for the show
We’re going full crip❤️‍🔥👌🏻

Something good for a family with bad kids- Belt
petition to have daz react to south park super nanny

Nice hat
Thank goodness I am Arabic If my kids is like that I can beat them
Cute doggo 😍

NOPE NO KIDS NOT FORR MMEEEEEEE🤣🤣🤣😡😡😰😰
I love your dog he so cute my grandma has a franchise called Casper so cute 🥰🥰
I didnt have the naughty spot i had the basement stairs wich was the scariest shit ever mom would even turn of the lights
When he said there's no such thing as being a man, I was just so grateful to have such an open minded person on the internet.❤️❤️
I’m special coz I have ADHD
"Hope you got your tea ready!" The second he said that I took a sip of my tea and now I feel like I'm being watched
When I was little I bit my mom and my mom bite me back but not hard and I never bit ever
Giz is adorable my friend has a dog called gizmo I love the name gizmo
The Mom is not punishing them for the actions of these kids. Oh no not happening on my watch. I would be like CPS for $500 Alex. Thank you. OMG How horrible those kids are.
The mom look he was talking about gives me nightmares lmaoooo, its genuinely horrifying
I love your dog🐶😊😍🤩
joe frost is dressed like an ikea couch pfffffffff
At 14 minutes he's speaking facts because my dad has 4 kids and my mum died so I help with most things because I'm the eldest
She look,s like a crten
You,r right
5:10 he bit me bam
Daz being a real ally to moms.
This reminded me of when they came to my house when I was younger about my brother and it never aired 💀
4 year old: *swearing* Me at 8: Thinking saying 'dumb' is a bad word
My Mother would beat me with a wok
Almost 1m likes in 5 days wow im so happy for you
REACT TO THS BOYS
i once got an award for the most forgetful person
Omg I love boston terriors so much, I forgot you had one he is adorable!
I nannyd a 4 yr old for 3 months, terror now I just nanny babys
The message at the end is so strong. ♥
Hi I’m joe joe who joe mama
The girl got slammed to the floor
I like it how daz said someone will get dropped kicked in the living room
We have a very strict upbringing, I wasn’t aloud my iPad in the week except on Tuesday, Friday night and the weekend giving it back on Sunday, no kind of social media. But I remember my mum having this alarm system on a Time out pad. I hated that thing. My mum only has to give me the look and I behave immediately when I’m naughty lol
5:20 😭
Ugh I love Jo and how amazing she is at this, but it's the confident, almost cocky air she seems like she has.  I HATE when people have that, and they are actually good at their job.   But other than that, I actually used one of her tips: getting down to their level and talking, and it FUCKING WORKED???
The adorable ones are always the worst. always
Please react to Tim Robinson's "I think you should leave" skits!!!!
what a cute doggo
Bro that boy wouldnt have wrists or teeth if he bit me
I think they are like that because autism
I named my cat gizmo not knowing my favorite YouTuber has an animal with the same name 🧍🏻‍♀️
She could put em in a home and live life but they are her kids so she wouldnt but when thay were lined up she got em there like little soildiers
12:10 Pull My Hair Back  And Put Me In Blue Im Supernanny And Im Coming For You
low key made me emotional...daz is the most genuine man ever
am i the only one who thinks the nanny looks like a nazi
Petition to have gizmo his own YouTube channel (like this comment if you agree)
I would smack the absolute FUCK out of my kid if he/she tried to hit my wife/husband
My mum just screamed SIT and I would
love the uncle daz speech :D
14:00 child = alcohol x bad choices
I am sick rn and daz just makes me smile
Puppy!!!! Gizmo is so adorable! Nothing wrong with having a puppy. Also awesome video as always.
Dog is cute
Funny thing is I know that kid i went to school with him, he was so racist 😂 and a massive bully, I don't him anymore but he was a asshole
His name may be gizmo but he'll always be Iggy to me
I started year 12 the other month and I’ve already been given an award for having a good attitude to learning 😂 I haven’t done anything special smh
"...like little nazis....🤨😒"
5:21 same when i was like 4 i bit my sister and my mother bit me
Weeks
I flipped my mum of and I had to stay away from my phone for 5 wekks
Parents beat your kids 😄
Gizmo looks like my dog Bijou
I love how one minute Daz can be making some jokes and the next he's giving us life advise. Which I think is really nice
Daz is funny asf but also so helpful with tips to all ages and caring to his community and others as well as people who raised him god bless daz ❤️🙏🏼
“That’s how I get mums attention, I relocate her jaw” 😂😂😂😂😂😆😆
Just one back hand
Ok so, I dont have my tea but i do have my covid
Daz Thank you for telling the boys and men aboit this cause its very common where i live  I really appreciate you for caring i love you💜💜
Daz: "go to the kitchen and realize there is no surface left where there isn't something PINNED ON IT" Me: "looking around Daz's room"
As of right now daz has 6.9 million subs👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👌👌👌👌👌
Need more Super Nanny reactions! Absolutely loved this ❤️😂
I’m 19 I have my own daughter my own home and my mum STILL gives me that look😂
I got a certificate in secondary school for showing up it registration (form class) for the first time is a few months😂
YESSS I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!
11:28 Ayo did he just say what I think he said???
She was just like my mum she my mum was always stressed she couldn’t see her friends because my dad scared them off
I’ve never seen that look because my mum died when I was little
Joes fuckin nanny McPhee without the fugliness
Dude if I had a Karen for a step mum I would awwwww you would not want to know what I would do
My sister is rude but not to the teacher and friends
That was me when I didn’t have my medication when I was four but a lot stronger
this is the wholesome content i came for
That dog is so cute
i dont know how she hasnt beaten the shit out of her kids
Congrats on 6.9 mil… 😏
I bit my mom, she bit me. I never bit again, same for hair pulling. 😂
5:22 his mouth tho
"I'm running up your energy bill mum"😂😂😂😂
My mum doesn’t call it the naughty spot with my brother because she doesn’t want him thinking that he is bad, just that what he did was bad. His actions are bad but he isn’t a bad person
If they thump you, thump them back that's how I learned
“It’s like Spider-Man but she was bitten by another mum!”
I hit my parents but I’m like “you suck! *hits* …….. I’m sorry
Yeah, I didn't want kids anyway. This seals the deal.
The best solution to solve anything is the chancla
Ayyyy u got a boston
If I spoke like that, my mum would’ve slaughtered me, hell, I think I did one time but I can’t remember cause I probably forced myself not to
Daz you should customise your door. And your looking dapper today keep it up 🙂😁
OMG DAZ YOU SOULD DO A SUPPERNANNY SKIT ON UR OTHER CHANNAL 😍
Did anyone else hear him say kiss my willie
hi das going on 4 years of watching you keep it up the greatest British youtuber ever. I love you man.
"oh my god some kid is bout to get drop kicked across the living room" -Daz Games me:if i said that i would get sent an island to make i phones
hi
10:01 Now if that’s not a screenshot, Idk what is. 🤣🤣😂
When I was a kid I remember going through that awful spiteful phase. And one day after I had hit my brother, my dad said, "Boy, if you don't knock that off, I gonna beat your ass like an Indian drum." And I looked him right in the eyes as I smacked my brother again. And the fire that flared in my father's eyes. He beat my ass. And I didn't hit my siblings again.   Point being, physical discipline is extremely effective and should be utilized accordingly.
Daz I have that exact same cup as you!   I was drinking tea out of it watching this I cant believe it 😂
This show was my entire childhood 😭😭😭
Daz once said… “I bit my sister but not in my twenties. Im not mental”
punch em
This 4 year-old can box better than Jake paul
*look at Joe in the corner* *ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh look at him bite the mother*
I would like te see more of this shit xD
I already hate kids     I dont know what i would have done to correct those kids if i was their mom  This is why im never having children
I wish I would my mom would sock me and sock my brother too for looking at her direction
You should really react to "thunderous" from Straykids it's worth reacting to.
the dog is sooooooooo cuteee i need it
I agree with daz, if i hit my parents they would tap me on the hand, if i bit them they would bite me
When I got put on the naughty step as a kid I would sneak to my room and grab random toys out of my floor lol
I'm gonna have to disagree that the father always has to be part of the child's life if he accidentally gets a girl pregnant. That's kind of like saying that just because a woman gets pregnant she should be required to raise a child. Some men get stuck in abusive situations because their partner has a child. On that note I thought the rest of the video was good and it's nice to see someone have compassion for single parents.
I literally just got an ad saying save my birth control from planned parenthood
daz blue is my favorite clolor
AAAAYYYYYYYYYY 6.9 for like 69 😏
It’s a dog! Wookie, wookie, wookie:)
Solution to this problem beat them it solves everything
I whatch these and glad I was good kid
if i was a parent and that happend the kid would be slapped hard af
The fact that daz named his dog gizmo means a lot Bc my childhood dog was named gizmo and I feel like it’s not a name for dogs that people hear a lot.
Puppy intros are the best
Oh my goodness I didn’t know you had a Boston!  He’s so cute!! I have 2 of my own
All seriousness, I felt her level of exhaustion. It takes SO much out of you, most people can't imagine. I'm glad he wasn't sitting there criticizing her the whole time. It's nice to be understood sometimes.
If I ever treated my mom or anyone older than me, I would hit with a hanger, a belt or a cane or maybe a smack...... put a muzzle on that boy to stop him from biting.
I notice that many small dogs have derpy eyes...😆
im spoiled but im still prittey scared of that look
14:18 “It’s not about being a man, I think that’s a toxic saying. Being a man, there’s no such thing. Be responsible.” This is why I love Daz.
cutest dog everrrr
daz be like WHATS UP DAZLER sucide
The only stopping me from moving from the step is my angry mum
He really said “Kiss my Willy”😂
Doctor Daz
Daz, you have to watch dance moms! It would be so funny to watch you react to Abby lee Miller 😂
Why is it that the people on supernanny haven't figured out how to discipline their kids? Oh he's screaming at you that he doesn't want anything and hitting you? Beat his ass and send him to bed hungry. That shit will stop real quick.
0:00 GIZMO
I’m sorry but watching your angry dad vault over the couch and run at you is scarier than the mom thing that my mom does
MOaR sUperNannY
If that kid had a knife, no doubt he would throw it at the mother. Or use it. This is why children that aren't disciplined can be life or death in many instances. My younger sister when she was 4, would drop a hard dinosaur on me and my mom from the top of the stairs all the time. 1940's style dinosaur with hard fibreglass plastic mold.
If I did any of this my ass would have been beat
I say spank them
IS THAT KID SAYING THR F SLUR????
It's only when the moms give the look not when the dads it hurts more when you're mom is disappointed in you am I right
I’m not kidding but an ad about Daz 3D and I’m like woah
A punishment I had when I was a kid was that when we got in trouble we had to stand up next to a wall with a coin inbetween our nose and the wall for ten minutes. But if we dropped the coin the timer would reset and we would stand there until the time was up or we calmed down.
What happened to that other dog daz had? I could have sworn he had a bigger dog.
they don't need a nanny they need an ass whooping
"omg they're hiding the devil aren't they" All I could think about was the conjuring 2 the whole time 🤣
My dogs name is gizmo
AWE SUCH A CUTE LITTLE PUPPYYYYYY
12:10 this sounds like a sort of fetish but I don’t know what
js, black folks don't let their kids run their lives
I find it ironic that I'm watching this and an ad for PLANNED PARENTHOOD POPS UP LMFAO!
OH NO it remindsme ofn the south park episode
White families -_-
I actually really love how you educated at the end
Ayo, when Daz said "wholesome content" at the beginning it made my heart so happy oml <3
them looking like a ikea couch is probably why Daz doesnt like her
I hit my brother with a pan once
Every single one of your videos make me laugh out loud. Please never stop being hilarious
Never too late to abort
I'd like to have a cup of tea with you ❤😊🤟
This is when you hit your kids
Ok but I remember when I was like 9 or 10 I would take a shower after an argument with my mom and I would run it for super long with the thought in my head " haha this will cost you extra money"
THE DOGGG   IS SOOOOOO CUTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEee
This is why I’m not having kids. These types of things are GREAT condom commercials. Not worth it in my opinion. I respect that others want to have kids, and I can see why, but as for me, fuck no.
dude if i did that to my mom when i was little tbh she would have put me up for adoption and if i had a kid and they did that to me i'd hit them back and say you hit me i hit you you call the the cops good i don't have to deal with you no more
I would have been punted into the sun if i did half of that stuff
i know that look man i know that look
NO PLAYSTATION FOR TWO WEEKS??? I WAS PINNED TO THE WALL BY MY THROAT FOR CALLING MY MOM A D*** AHAHAHAHAHAHA
Daz: there is always a chance to have a baby Me: I don’t think there is in my case 😂
My parents would have beat the shit out of me lmao
I miss when Daz used to use the airblower on the microphone
Long week daz just makes my day ever day
JoJo reference 0:00
The middle finger part...yeah hahahaha
My mother would have and probably did beat my ass if I didn’t listen
My cats name is gizmo
Daz - “ She’s a full time mom and a punching bag.” 😂😂😂
MY MUM YELLS AT ME FOR LEAVING 1 PASTA ON MY TRAY AND THEY ARE SHOUTING AT THEIR MUM AND KICKING HER
If I was that 4 year old kids dad he would have been power bomed through a table.
"she got them all lined up like little nazis" I CHOKED LMAO
YOU GOT GROUNDED FOR 2 WEEKS MINE WOULD OF GOTTEN DESTROYED
Daz you should watch the walten files
That door was on life support
OMFGGGGG IS THAT IGGY?????? IS THAT A JOJOS REFERENCE????!!!
Your dog is so cute and what a coincidence I had a dog His name was gizmo to
It depends how good u. Treat them
I’ve heard you tell this story before the mimicking one just as funny as the first
My dogs name is gizmo!!!

Oh my god I wish I could hold my puupy and he won't kill me, bit my nose the other day because I was leaving somewhere and brought him with me, nose bled on the bridge until night.
Iggy
that nanny would quit the first day at my aunts house
daz for no reason: Like little nazis
i’m not saying that hitting your kids will help but i would‘ve bitch slapped those kids across the country just out of frustration💀
he should react to nikocado
I can admit that the look that ALL mothers do, is still scary. She still does that look to me and I'm 16. I used to stick my middle fingers up when my mum had her back turned when I was younger too. Both my mum and I laugh about it whenever it gets brought up.
In america you take a belt and you beat their butt
I've worked in the daycare industry for 7 years so far..it is a challenge and isn't for everyone 0.0
if i behaved that way i would have been slapped so hard i would been slapped to live with a small Taiwanese family and be made to do hard manual labour
Where's you're other dog 🐕

Jo just standing there in actual hellfire like:🧍🏻‍♀️
Gizmo is so cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee🥰

Gizmo looks pist 😆 🤣 😂
And oh my God that was violet
If them girls or that boy what kicking there legs at me laying down I would pick them up by there legs and slam them against the wall
AHHH HES BITING
I love daz. He is a good man. An excellent idol
If telling the kids what they’re doing wrong doesn’t fix the behavior I’d whoop their ass. I know for a fact if I acted like this even a bit with my parents I’d be dead
2:04 "Like little Nazis"
Please do more reacting videos to supernanny
That speech at the end was so wholesome
I ones got an award for putting my hand up
If I did ANY of that to my mom she would simply ✨eliminate me✨
My dogs name is Gizmo he’s a frenchie
Council house version of mrs doubt fire 😂😂😂😂😂
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VID
Now I understand why the dad went to go get the milk
Daz: AHHH HES BITTEN!!!
God Gizmo is just too cute !!😩😪
Welcome to Ireland 🇮🇪

When I was a little kid, I was being annoying and my mum said she would call the police if I didn't do my colouring book and I believed her for some reason and cried while I was drawing
Need John sena music
Of they were mine I'd say "I'm going sainsburys" and I'd run for the hills 😂😂😂😂
Mom: jam or ham  Kid:f**k off mom

Pls react to dance moms
My school’s sex Ed was really good, they went really in depth about everything and my teacher was actually a teenage parent so she knew the importance of it all
iggy?
The oldest was chill
Super nanny: she's mental unstable Watchers: NO SH/T SHERLOCK
A belt solves a lot of problems
For all the people that watch one punch man if i annoyed my mum i feel like i can feel the king engine
you may be a single man with a dog but you're a single man the AN ADORABLE DOG so it's a win 😆
The best way to handle a bad child is a belt and a little bit of “this is gonna hurt me more than it hurts you”
Please wach ms browns boys
I dont have tea but i have your merch on
Asians be like. This kids gonna get it. Me as an Asian wants to slap this kid. The four Yr old. Aaaargh. I can't watch this no more
Daz reminds of kindly kein but the non family friendly version
Daz at the start of the video:“your on the wire giz”  The dog: “what I didn't know I was on the wire? Why are u moving me”  Me: *doesn't stop laughing because of how funny Daz games is * sorry he's just funny he's genuinely funny you guys can't put me down for laughing at him
Sarah watching her dad exposing her as a child like 👁️💧👄💧👁️

And Jo Frost is dressed like an IKEA couch - Daz Games 2021
Daz you should react to Bunches of lunches. Watch a few of their videos.
9:07 why is this so true ?
Daz 2021 : GET THAT BOY IN AN MMA RING  Me: but he’s 6  Daz 2021 :GET THAT BOY TRAINED  Me: wtf
Sweet dog
I feel so sorry for the mom. But she also really doesn’t give consequences or reasoning.
Super nanny is the best birth control ✨
Been along time since ive watched you and you had a studio upgrade
9:15 the look it’s true 😳
Daz makes things so much more funny😂😂😂
I’d it a Boston terrier of a french bulldog
Dad makes videos so much more funny 😂😂
Who else’s parents would have taken there belt off and laid in to you for cussing at them
5:05 we got Mike Tyson on our hands
Ok so like my cousins are sorta well behaved the youngest oh yeah he’s an angel unless he’s scared! The oldest she is autistic and can not talk very well so she can’t control herself when she is trying to explain something to you which makes you feel bas because like she is trying her best but just gets stressed out by trying to tell you so she kinda will throw things and one time she broke the pop corn machine when I was babysitting and I yelled for her to go and sit in the corner and she started crying and did but whenever my grandpa tells her to she doesn’t because she does not respect him unlike how she respects me.
Who was that women with u when I saw u in tesco last week
"Like little naziy"🤣🤣
I use to watch this all the time 😊
THE GOG IS SO FREAKING CUTE
he should watch super nanny dealing with the cook family lmao megan said something like “i didn’t pinch her i hit her” or something
I remember pulling this girls hair when I was a kid & her mum saw me from the kitchen window & I ran up the path & her mum caught me &  scragged me by my hair & said “HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?!?!” Safe to say I never did that again 😂
My sisters kid went through that hitting phase for a little bit. She was always hesitant about it too. Like she didn't want to hit anyone but she didn't know how to express her frustrations. Now that she can all is fine.
This is why I am childfree. I would *not* be able to deal if I had a demon-child like that.
That dog looks amazing
My brothers Girlfriend Dumped his daughter on to him and left for another man and we still haven’t heard from her, Shes a healthy baby and we all love her to pieces
gizmo, dude that's my dogs name AND he has the same color pattern that your dog has. freaky shit.
Daz: Lots of people have kids and its not a good idea My mum with 7 kids:
YOUR DOG IS ADORABLE
hi Daz my gran recently got a bostin terrior and omg are they so cute, hope you have a good day and keep Dazling
"ive watered you"
Giz the geeza
I love how Daz literally perfectly described how my mom reacts when I used to mock her 🤣😂🤣
Of all the times to have my name
Can you do another one?
OMG UR DOG IS ADORABLE I WANT IT!
Only daz can make a 15min vid outta a 2min 26secs vid
the biting back technique does work lol when i was little my first pony but me on my arm, i grabbed his ear and bit him back. He never bit anyone again 😂😂
I didint get punished my mum just looked at me then I had no Playstation for 2 weeks
“Tara is pinning all her hopes on super nanny Jo frost.” Daz: “and Jo Frost is dressed like an ikea couch.”
The last time I saw a show like this a little boy just called his mom sucker and the dad was like do not call your mom sucker and start slapping him somewhere
My mom never hit me but she was a stern woman she didn’t need to hit people
DAZ CALM DOWN YOU CANT JUST GO GIVING PEOPLE...THE LOOK IT HURTS!
if those kids were mine id drop kick them
When I was little my mom took me to the bad corner thing and she could not do that after a will cuz I started to like it 😂
At that point I would just throw the damn child in the dumpster
what did the kid say at 11:31.....
You and your girlfriend broke up🥺
“Kiss my willy”😂😂😂
4:46 it,s me
I was working out while watching this and I almost dropped my weights because I started laughing
I was so exited to watch this and its worth it
This episode is nothing compared to the episode the kids called super nanny for help from the parents
At the start he said she looked like an IKEA couch and at 4:46 he said she looks like a curtain nah shes just being a IKEA couch
when i was younger if me or any of my siblings said a bad word we would have to wash our mouth with soap
“I’ve fed you, I’ve watered you” THATS PROBABLY WHY GIZMO LOOKS MISERABLE TODAY DAZ!!! YOURE NOT SUPPOSED TO WATER DOGS UR SUPPOSED TO GIVE THEM WATER READ THE INSTRUCTIONS
When my nephew was 6 he was being really bold and nothing she did would work make him be good so she brought him to the police station and asked police man to pretend to arrest him with out my nephew hearing her say it so the police man said to him ur under arrest for being naughty and Brought him to the holding cell they have in the police station and scared the ship out of him and he was never naught again they only had him in it for like 2mins
The way mum's look at you when you did something wrong and you Know you are about to die is apparently the look I give when I'm mad or annoyed according to my friends and that look works more than words or violence 😂
this family isn't even one of the bad ones on  super nanny. And THAT is what is sad.
Hey daz can you read a story bc ur voice is so calming
Last year I got an award for being the most dramatic 😂
My dogs name is also gizmo
‘I’ve taken you a walk, I’ve fed you, I’ve watered you.’- Daz 2021
Only daz can make 2 minutes videos 17 minutes long
Stop omg my dog’s name is literally Gizmo-
:)
Bloody Jesus
GIZMOS BACK!
She's going down like THATS NAUGHTY
Eric Cartman got the better of supernanny....
can I just say that dog is so cute and my dogs name is gizmo too
My cats name is gizmo
6.9M subs YES!
Day 5 of asking Daz to play 12 minutes
Can you react to another episode of her fixing the family
Always good to watch Daz while eating dinner / supper
“BLOO-DY JE-SUS” 😂😂😂😭😭😭
daz you awesome
When I was young my parents used a method they saw in Leave it to Beaver, when I first threw a tantrum to try to get what I wanted they would just look at me or ignore me  I did not throw tantrums for very long
Daz: How can we make a british nanny look like a british nanny? Ooh we can tie her hair back so tight she goes pink 👍🥶
Oh yea the look works wonders. I work in a primary school and use "the look" regularly. If I shout at them it's gets worse. I look at them and they shit themselves lol
To be fair, relocating her jaw WOULD get the mom's attention, so it's a pretty solid plan
The cat "mEoWwW" super nanny: *ignores cat*
Just do it the asian way, pull out the slipper and gives them spanking.
ive been waiting for this video forever
I'm sick right now while watching this and I'm laugh so hard that I'm crying now 😭
Put them in an orphan
Omg my dogs also called gizmo
slap them, spank them (the slap is for drastic measures only, and gentle enough to where they learn but it dont hurt hurt)
Your Boston’s so cute!!! I had one named Harley but we had to put her down in February sadly.
Went and spat out my cereal when he went BIRTH CONTROL- we all need it
Definitely the quieter mums are scariest! Whenever my auntie is annoyed, she whispers. That's when you know to run
Where's that damn dog looking? haha nah love him. Great video! as always
Smack the shit out of them
Your  dog is so cute  daz
love the Boston terrier
Daz should be super grandma
Who remembers Gizmo when he was a puppy
I bit my sister when I was younger and my mum bit me back and I didn’t do it again
8:22 when your starving and there’s kfc on the table
I remember one time i cussed my mom out under my breath AND I SHIT U NOT SHE WAS DOWN THE HALLWAY AND SHE SOMEHOW FUCKIN HEARD ME AND WALKED BACK AND THROW HER SLIPPERS AT ME LITERALLY PERFECTLY HITTING MY HEAD i cried never cussed under my breath ever again around my mom
Lol my mom gives me the same look and that’s when I know I’ve fucked up😂
i was watching this with my mother, we were laughing so much
Dad is that a guttar
You are 100% right Daz my mom gave me thst look before and I knew I was dead meat the moment my mom gave me that look, it’s the your in trouble look or I’m displeased with your actions look.
6.9 mil
I love your dog❤️
Man your just don't care about nothing dude hahahahaha
How are these kids so strong bro they all going super sayian
Nazis 😂
THIS I’m so excited I couldn’t think of a better combo than Daz and Supernanny. Ps His dog is adorable
If my kid is tryna throw hands we will throw hands lmao
Your dog is so cute
If a mum ever gives you that look, it means imminent death. I only got that look once, and it was cuz I didn't know at the time that bastard was considered a swear in my house
Wait. I have a cat called gizmo / giz
Aww your dog is so cute and I love the name Gizmo ♥
Awww
“Oooh my god some kid is gonna get drop kicked across the living room”  omg I literally died laughing ( 7:51 btw)
My parents had me young. (Right around 20). My mom was in college and my Dad had the chance to run. My mom was willing to do it alone. In the end my dad was better off money wise and he got full legal rights. I love my mom and dad they are my parents and I know they love me. But I know that I was the screw up. Daz was so very right in the fact of if you aren’t prepared to have a child or to take care of that child please don’t. Coming from the kid who was the accident or the screw up. It hurts a lot. And I have always known it and always will. Sorry this was a novel but thanks for reading it
The dog is so cute at the start
"she got them all lines up, like little Nazis" GOT ME LAUGHING
The doggy is so cute
“Pin her hair up so tight, her scalp is barely holding on”😂😭
If I even tryed that I would die (get a ass whopping with a stick) so yeah
When he said he going super sayin I was dying
your dog really looks like my friends dog
Yeet the child
yelling at kids is not effective bc it either: the kids get used to it and start seeing it as something unimportant since u thats all u do anyways have this stagnant fear and feeling of inferiority whenever youre around (there could be more idk)
Ur intro sounds like dantdm
I am so fricking sick of when peoples kids start acting up and instead of punishing them or enforcing rules to stop the bad behaviour, they come out and say “yeah my kids got adhd and/or autism” like that is so wrong. This is why i hate everyone.
Mate my mum wouldn't hit us my dad did if I did Amy of this stuff I'd get smashed man
GIZMOOOOOOOO
i wonder where the kid got the swearing from…
YOUR DOG IS SO CUTE OML
I remember when I refused to do my room my mum would start doing it and then I knew if I didn’t go up them stairs and take over I was never seeing my friends again
Dad went to go get the milk he will be back when the kids can give him money
This confirms that dogs look like their owners I LOVE IT
Wow you have 6.9 million subs hmmmm interesting
The mum look though he told the thing about mocking his mum before lol
this is what happens when you dont smack your children not hit but a firm open palm would fix it
📝don't 📝have📝 ✨kids✨
6.9mil!
Does Supernanny sponsor condoms? They should.
If that was my kid I would slap him so hard that he learns his manners, this is what my parents did with me and it was effective
Poo
I kicked my mum when I was younger then she kicked me not hard then I stopped 😅
The camera man: 🧍‍♂️ -> ⬜
10:24 me and my siblings had this and I swear whenever I went on my mum forgot about me because of how quiet I was. I was once there for 45 minutes before she realised I was still there. 😂
"AERRR HES BITING" FUCKING DEAD LMAOOO 😭😭
i would've probably get my skull crushed by my mom from a spoon if i did any of these things to my mom
Dazz got the life skills
This kid could beat the shit out of me
Omg! How cuuuuuuute is the dooooooog?! 💓😅❗
if my kids are like this, im fucking abusing them
Wait who’s joe
this is why you beat your kids
Noice.
My family had a child like that in our care (fostering). Her outbursts were exactly like Shannon’s, but they were about 10 times worse. We had to call the cops on her because she was physically beating up everyone in the house, including her siblings. She’s no longer in our care for her siblings safety and her siblings have now been adopted by us. The two boys use to lash out physically too, but since they’ve been out of the toxic environment, their behavior has changed for the better
My school once gave me a certificate for having a plastic bag (That weighted about a pound or so) Full of colored pencils and stuff. Lmao
I used to binge super nanny lol
“I walked you” “I feed you”  “ I WATERED YOU” 😂😂
Best form of birth control *sips tea* become daz
What she needs to do is just stop giving them attention when they act up. But that's right I ain't scared of my mam cause she always shouts but my dad jesus I'm scared as fuck when he gets angry
Daz then realised this was the conjouring
Oh don't tell me another one called Gizmo 😞   Love the dog tho
Gizmo is getting so big
i feel like Daz has lost motivation
We can all confirm that their little demons and the four year old is the most one that screams :)
I think there was something in gizmos biscuits
When I was younger I thought that Super Nanny was somewhat related to Abby Lee Miller.
You have to watch the whole episode next time. Kids are insane. I don't remember the name of the episode but it was a girl who literally scratched supernanny hard. And supernanny just stood there.
0:18  "I've fed you, i've watered you"  how do you water a dog?
I still remember I was about 4 and I bit my sister then my mum did the bitting thing which you mentioned but at the time my skin was really fin for no apparent reason and my skin got stuck to her teeth (she did not bite hard BTW) and I started to bleed I was not in pain but my mum never did that again
Oh my god...I was so shocked when he said "Giz" and "Gizmo" I have a dog named Gizmo !!!! 😂😂😂😂 Loved the video ❤❤😂😂😂💖💖💖💖
Just dress up up as Mary popins like in your vines 😂
They need more discipline, back if I hit my mum I would have had a wooden spoon around my face or arse
Shes like a curtain
Bruh my mom would Baki slapp me into another dimension for just calling her an idiot
would daz become johnwick if someone killed his dog
that dog . is . c u t e
nice dog
"Like little nazis"
My Frenchie is called gizmo also 😅
I love how much you’re channel has grown I’ve been watching since you were at 100k, it’s awesome.
1:43, tf is that noise
Sometimes... Violence IS the answer
Na if I even thought about acting like that my mum would discombobulate my ass into the shadow wealm
Right my mum used to have these purple tinted sunglasses and when we went on holiday or out anywhere in the summer, when we were young me and my sisters would fight and she didn’t yell, she looked at us and those glasses made her look 10x scarier
Daz i have NEVER gotten a certificate for ANYTHING, and i had all A's and B's.
“i fed u, i watered u” like a freaking plant lol
Wait hes single? What happened to his girlfriend he went ghost hunting with?
I haven't laughed this much this week😭✋
I attempted a tantrum only once. I got a smack. In the supermarket. Never happened again.
*Intro:* 😵‍💫🤔 Tf kinda dog is that? Me *simply cheat/ & looks up:* 🤣✅ "Oh found the exact name while scrolling… 🐩 *Boston Terrier*
These kids should be professional fighters
The puppy is ugly but cute at the same time
w h o l e s o m e   c o n t e n t <3
Once at nursery I told my (teacher I guess they would be called) that my mum locks me in the attic and makes me watch TV. Not a single bit of truth in that though but I said it and if my mum didn't know the teacher well then she would have probably been investigated.
“Yes before you say I am that lonely single man with a dog”- daz
Your dogs so cute 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶🐶
I swear if I did that my mom would make me deaf by screaming as loud as she can i would be in living hell
did you ask how did they make a british nanny look like a british nanny?!
Ha! If I did that to my mom I would’ve been reading books and nothing else. After getting slapped or worse, plus I’m 20 and now I don’t wanna live on the streets. I remember my older brother yelling “FUCK YOU” at my dad. I was in awe that he had the foolishness to say that to my dad who knows how to professionally fight. Let’s just say he got grabbed by the neck and told off. It wasn’t the first either, he’s done that I front and pinned my older brother against the wall saying to watch it. Plus last time I got into an argument with my mom, she thought I flipped her off (I didn’t, I’m not stupid) and she basically gripped my arm. That scared the shit outta me at the time. Plus I respect my parents WAAAY to much to disrespect them like THAT. Sure I’m stronger now compared to my parents but fuck I love em too much to hurt em.
Your dog 🐶🥰
You'll also get my BOOOOOTS
From experience the oldest child always gets the least attention because people think they are more mature. They also try to cause the least problems because the others are acting up. That being said my parents would have snatched my soul from my body. we never acted like that, but it wasn't a single parent home.
My dog is called gizmo too he is a griffin dog
All this time super nanny is actually Daz in in drag
That’s not even a child, that’s just Satan’s reincarnation 💀
Is that Iggy!
You think their bad? I used to bite my family as a baby...i drew blood 😳😳. Looking back, if I made a move at my mom, whether the intention to hit, bite or kick, she would counter and slap me into next Tuesday
8:22 only OGs remember the first time he mentioned this
i paused the video to get tea. your welcome.
That mum look - so true
das you say this story in like every daz watchers video
5:36 : people in gta V be like
If reese swore at me I would rip out his vocal cords right then and there
i lve your vids daz
Why did his brain go to little Nazis 🤣🤣
If my kids acted like this, firstly there ass would be whooped, I would beat the shit out of them and throw them in the garbage.
9:21 no no, I wouldnt get a loook she would have killed me already
All I have to say is nice  For the subs lol
Tbh if I would have slapped my mom like that behave like that and swear like that she would have slapped me into another dimension
Oh my gosh I used to watch super nanny all the time lol
i saw this in a south park episode once
when he said his dogs name I freaked out because his dogs name is the same as my dogs name lol
Good god if I hit my Mum I’d expect her to rip my soul out through my kneecaps
You have a cute dogo
It was a 2m video and  his is 15m long I love your daz
The parents were like let’s cover every single surface we possibly can with yellow piece of paper to show us that our kids are OK once in a while
Best contraception?! Pfft. Working in service is even better. I didn’t know just how high and long a child could scream for not getting what they want 😂
I can’t she said a 5:05
daz ur subscriber count is very funny.
As a gamer myself I’d let my kid start cussing only on games by age 14 or 15
6.9M subs funny number
Your mouth is for FOOD. NOT FOR EATING LEGS
I dont regret finding your yt
If my kid acted like this half their face would be gone from slapping it the FUCK OFF,
I've got a poster terior
5:23 not sure if I’m the only one bothered by thing thing on dazs’ lip. 😅😅 I know it’s not related to the video but I just couldn’t get past it.😅😅
From early on, if you spare the rod you can spoil the child. I know...people think this is ancient Biblical nonsense. It is not. No one is equipped to learn a super-psychology...mainly because it is far too complex...even for the so-called "learned" psychologist. A child must learn consequence...even the most genetically disturbed child...all the more so. Modern psychology and liberal law has disenfranchised the authority of the typical parent...and that is part of the reason we see an increase in disturbing behaviors and more parents giving up on their children. It is why our prison population grows and more are released back into an ever growing violent society. More and more is required of the parent and less and less of the child. It is why we have so many narcissists who are also sociopaths. The discipline of fathers has died as the role is being demolished by the so-called intellectualism of liberal philosophy. So...you will only see it get worse. Good luck in your new role if you choose to be a psychologist. The simplicity of understanding from a good spanking could have spare generations of despair. Calling everything "abusive" is the foolishness of ignoring basic life contexts.
Mate I got bashed
My dogs name is Gizmo and he has like almost the exact coloring of him
I NEED HIM TO SEE AN AMERICAN VERSION WITH JO🤯 I SWEAAAAAAR
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm  *beep*

He pays 200 or 100 and that is like 1% of is paycheck and he isn't even being a dad to his son my mom divorced his ass because he is a prick and mentally hurt my mother and my grandpa just passed and now we are extremely poor we can't afford cloths nor food nor medicine and me and my mom. Are sick mentally and physically and we have to take medicine daily she has to take 16 pills a day 8 at night 8 at day and I take 3 morning and 2 night I believe sometimes more I'm on a highly addictive drug and I can rarely take it so I won't end up having withdraws I'm going to stop it here I've let out what I needed to  I went on my rant
Congress but in a house lol
At 1:41 all I could look at was the cat
Yess that has happened to me too my mum gave me the look and I new I was dead 😭😂
6.9M *N o i c e*
yall im so sorry but when that kid bit his mom the first thing i thought of was slapping his head 💀 my latina grandmother ( my mom wasnt around) would have decapitated me with a wooden spoon AINT NO WAY SHE DIDNT HIT HIM WHATTTTT
my dogs name is gyzmo hahah
oh my i love daz he’s such a lovely man and an amazing father x
Some kids just need to be beat. Not hard because they are younger but enough to learn a lesson.
That lady needs a belt
Feel this bro. My father broke up with my mum and I know him and he lives near me but I fear him because of how abusive he was so I don’t want to visit, he doesn’t even support my mum he just doesn’t even pay for me.
Pull out the belt then you know what to do from there
I would’ve been backhanded by both parents with such power that my skeleton separated from the rest of my body
only OG's know daz has already told the middle finger story before.
hispanic children doing this kind of behavior: 💀
I’ve genuinely wondered how I would be as a parent and daz describing his moms parenting seems like the type of dad I would be, like if my kid wouldn’t stop biting I wouldn’t bite them hard but bite back to get them to stop, and then I would definitely give my kids death glares most of the time, And this is just something I think I would do as a parent personally but I would totally whenever I’m home and if my child throws a fit I would just flop on the floor and try to take a nap as my way of throwing a tantrum until they calm down
Did Daz say he’s a single parent so he lives w his daughter by themselves no gf?? I’m so confused I have bad hearing but I’m not deaf
Gizmo is so fuckin cute SO CUTE
I’m taking them all the way to North America😕
JUDGE, I SWEAR I DROP-KICKED THAT CHILD IN SELF-DEFENSE!
Not rude you can put them up for adoption
I used to throw tantrums at the store and my mother would look at me very silent and she should pinch my arm to make me stop
LIKE LITTLE NATSES!!!👌😆
What if SHE runs off
What happened to his daughter were is does she live with him
When my little sister was younger she was like the son
I play fight with my parents sometimes but never to actually hurt them. If I hit them with the intent to hurt them I would get hit with the chancla so hard it would look as if hulk himself punched me
Hes single? I thought he had a daughter?
Your A DAD !!!
* _Searching Frantically_ *   _Where the f*uck is my belt?!???_
IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT HOW A 4 YEAR OLD SAYING AN F-SLUR😭😟
I hope I'm not the only one who notices the fly in the background near the end
Having two parents isn't actually all that great an option, depending on the people. My parents both sucked.
Gizmo is literally the cutest thing on this earth 🥺🥰
I truly wonder where the dad is. Men if you have sex with a girl know she can get pregnant and if she does you have to be a man and take responsibility for your actions. I know Daz said that he doesn't like the "be a man" line but I think sometimes the only way to get it through some guys heads (specifically the men ones that need to hear it) is to be that harsh. Traditionally men had to take responsibility and take care of their children and their mothers and far too often I do not see that happening.
I thought the video said super fanny😭
DAZ IS THE NEW SUPPER NANNY!
Pro tip for parents: throw your kids. That will be all
Ok, time to make some people mad. The phrase "be a man" isn't toxic, sexist, offensive, what have you. It's a phrase meaning that a male needs to take up his role as the man of a number of responsibilities. In this case we have family, there has to be a man in the picture and I'm not talking literally. Even in a gay relationship or non binary, there has to be a male figure in the kid's life (especially if it's a male child) and in the spouses life because even if you have half a child it's difficult to raise them with one parent If you want to know some of the reasoning behind this you can ask my opinion on it or you can just Google it, irdc. I'm just using my first amendment to explain why the phrase "be a man" isn't toxic; it's just over used  Yes there is grammatical error, no I'm not gonna fix it
I can't beleiev that my dog has the same name as his 🥺
Great vid
If I was that 4 year old father, he’d be a goner
If my kid smacked me im smacking them in next week
WE FINALY GET TO SEE LINDA!!! XDDDDD
I used to get the naughty step then when I realised I could just get up my mum went super sane and hit me so hard I saw Jesus 😟
i once got a certificit for not having a jacet potato XD
this is literally why i love daz. he always knows what to say and how to say it and has like the best opinions. the day he gets canceled is literally the day society has gone complete shit.
I would like to try England’s hot tea sometime, around America, we drink our tea cold

13:47, gay, problem solved
I'm ngl I'm 15 (my profile pic is my dad) and I am supposed to be a dad soon. I was just going to leave them but you really helped me decide that I'm going to be there for them. Thank you so much!!
if i ever treated my parents like that, i would of been dead xD
Let me tell you a story me alone I had to deal with a 5 year old it was tough very stressful very chaotic but nothing nothing can ever be more rewarding than to have that little bit of time to yourself
I had the naughty step growing up...only thing keeping me there was if I got up or even dared move to the step above...wowie that stern angry parent look. Lol

How to make a British Nanny look like a British Nanny? "PULL her hair back SO TIGHT that the scale is BARELY holding on!" - Daz 29th of September 2021
These kids get a belt each
I thought daz flipped her off because he was playing drums too loud though.

Hey Jessie!!!  Woaahhhh!!!!!

7:56 DÆS NOUATEY
My chest hurts just from watching this
wow I was the millionth view on this video
Bro no one told me that Iggy would be in a daz video
Listen bring this children to cape Town i promise that child will be straight in a week🤣like if you're colored
Forget super nanny that woman needs a belt
Who is the mother of your daughter??? Btw I love your videos and they make my day 😁😁😁😁😁😁💖💖💖💖💖
i believe if a woman can choose to have an abortion a man should have the choice of whether or not he should have 100% responsibility for the child but i see where you come from
WAIT, DAZ I DONT HAVE MY TEA
YES im so glad you're finally not ignoring us i've been waiting fOREVER for you to react to this
This is the prime example of bad parenting. Props to her for not being abusive. Hitting and abusing your kids isn’t the answer for this. They need therapy and counseling or just someone to tell them & teach them how to act.
Lol 6.9 million
is no one going to talk about the fact that YOUTUBE COMMENTED?!?!?!  | \/
Only daz can make a 15 minute vid out of a 3 min vid 😂✌🏻
My twin sister bit me so hard she left scars. My mom tried everything. They tried to tell me to bite her back, but I wouldn’t do it. So finally my mom just bit her in the arm, just like Daz’s mom. She never bit me again.
0:17 I fed you, I WATERED YOU 🤣🤣🤣🤣
6:33 Ha! Yea-No! I've been slapped in the face by other people's kids and that's different but if when I have a kid and a hand comes in my direction? Haha.. You funny, Thinkin I'm gonna need a Nanny. That kid would have nothing in their room besides a bed and a ball and jacks, If they're lucky and have friends over they can play marbles or pogs.
Daz is so right about the biting thing. The same thing happened to me when I was younger😂
why isn't daz a therapist or super nanny at this point, mans is spot on.
Me when i become super nany 👨‍👩‍👧👊👊👊👊🖕🖕🖕💣💣💣💀☠😈👿👹👺
Bruh if I did that that I would get slapped in the face
GIZMO! love it, love the content!
Ayo why does ur mug look like a ps5 😂
I called my mom a bitch over a game of Uno and my dad and mom just looked at me no words were spoken I new I was doomed so got the belt and just waited for hell to come down on me
You should watch the full episodes. It shows the process of the whole parenting, and how she teaches the family how to handle their kids.
6.9mil subs nice
First of all you don't need a nanny get a Mexican mother and she will straighten your kids out she will get the chancla and and beat the s*** out of your kids that's what happened to me and now I'm completely fine and I don't disrespect my mom at all anymore
in England can u not use the belt
My 3 year old cousin bit my 4 year old brother and my aunt just baped my 3 year old cousin in the nose so hard that he fell back
Cute doggo
sometimes the women stop contact with dads

2 weeks no console. U git off easy
they do be giving us that look
Like little Nazis 🥲😂
10:45 "There's nothing keeping me here" You are! In a well-performed Time out/Naughty-step-place, the child *will* stay put by itself. Why? Because every time the child moves from the spot, the parent put it back and start over the timer. Start this early and you won't have to do this more than a handful of times in their life, as long as you are 100% consequent. The first time you probably have to carry it back 20 times but the second time, the kid normally gets it and will stay after 5 tries to escape. Do it right and it's very effective, showing authority without causing fear or hurt.
Daz saying he wants to help out and if he were to daz would get bitten and then he'll bite back and boom the child has no arm
My mum does that biting technic and it's works so well with the younger kids
Not gonna lie Gizmo is cuter than my Boston because he does nothing but try to guilt trip me 24/7 lmao
Daz please play the new life is strange!
YESS
The dog 🥰🥰
Daz's advice is always so amazing, Sarah must be so grateful.
I knew a woman like this where I used to live. She had 3 kids with different fathers and nobody to help her out. All of the kids had mental issues. Her family practically hated her and she got so low and nobody could help her and she turned to dr*gs, smoking and alcohol as a coping mechanism. It didn't go well for her and she ended up losing one of her kids to the father. They struggled for money a lot and I was in the same year as the oldest and it was common for them all to miss school and some days they quite literally only had £3 or £4 in their bank. Their youngest had been inappropriately touched by her father and she got full custody of her. My mum was friends with her and sometimes if they were really low on money mum would send me up the street to their house to give them Shepard's pie she'd made for them or to give them milk or even just a fiver. And this woman had been with several people before on and off one of them didn't sit right with me because of how he acted towards kids especially females and turns out he was a registered s*x offender and hadn't told her. She was a mess and unfortunately we had to move away from the area because of my step-dad's job so I don't know how she's doing now but the last thing I know that happened was that she got full custody of her youngest/only daughter. And apparently the reason her family hated her was because she had gotten pregnant at a young age and refused to get an abortion.

HOLY SHIT DAZ GOTS IGGY FROM JOJO!
It is the Karen now a days
If I swore at my mom let alone hit her I would ether be dead..... or missing chunks of my ass...
Daz, plenty of women all over the world would be delighted in marrying you. Just reach out and touch someone (in a fully consensual way)
here's the asian way of disciplining your kids. If they act up, Kick the living shit out of em until they listen. I can say that cause i've experienced it
Proof why i dont want kids. But if somehow I did have kids I would have made the adoption center those kids home in a matter of seconds <3
Daz not meaning to be rude but your dogo is looking at the past and the future at the same time👀
I got an award from my primary school when I was in reception because a kid brutally ripped out my hair 💀
if i ever did that as a child i would be dead, no hesitation my mother would have ended me
*me "come here you little gremlin your going back to the shadow realm"
She’s got them all lined up… like little Nazis” I’M GONE 😭😭
YO I REMEMBER WATCHIBG THESE WITH MY MOM WHEN I WAS YOUNG THEY USED TO BE FUNNY AF 🤣🤣
That’s why when I get older I’m having a vasectomy no 18 years off problems for me
If that were me… that child is on the next step to see Satan himself 😃✋🏻
Brb just gonna go make my mandatory tea
*kid bites mum*  AHHHH HES BITIN 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My kids had bit me like that , I would have torn their asses up.
Are you still In your 20s?
Ksi as a kid 😂😂
Ha I would take myself to the naughty spot voluntarily and my sis swears and he is younger than him and swears but we said it once and did it like will do it and so yea but she doesn’t do it aimed at anyone
That is a cockeyed dog.
Don’t forget The stern head shake and “I’m disappointed in you”
Cosmic Gizmo sees all
"kids going super Saiyan" 😂 "Stands on the table AHHHHH" 😂😂😂😂
did daz say he watered the dog
What if I’m gay? Can I still get pregnant by a woman?
That kid is out of control 😂
Gizmo is so cute
how my mom and i communicate is not hi. it's flipping each other off
Can we take a second how gizmo is the cutest doggy ever we love you daz you are awesome and the most caring person ever.
I can't imagine behaving like this as a child, or having a child and letting them act like this
My mom has done that stare and I do it back we are both Scorpios and have the sad and rudeness but I can overpo her
I am also that lonely single man with a dog 😅
9:16 When mums look at you like that, up and down, they're measuring you to see how big of a grave they need to dig.
Haven’t watched dad in like a year jeeez  When Tf did he get a dog
I’m actually curious if maybe the dad is abusive. My biological dad was so I didn’t know that was wrong and only in the last few years have realised that I was abused and mistreating my friends. He’s picking this up from someone and he thinks it’s right.
Men don’t leave the woman when you have kids, my dad:🙅🏼‍♂️🏃🏻‍♂️Welp he came back two more times then jest went again: 🙅🏼‍♂️🏃🏻‍♂️🧜🏻
If I hit my mum I would probably nock my mum out
Me getting I'm blue dabo debabodae
We have the same dog
YOU HAVE A DOGITS SO SO CUTTE gimmeeee😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Yes daz has the same name as my dig epic
My dog everyday be like:👁👄👁...woof
Giz is literally the dog from jojo part 3
as the youngest of 4 with a mum who raised us all on her own - my mum had violent kids, my brother would tell my sister she could fly if she held a teddy and jumped out the window, my other siblings would attack each other or anyone. they were spiteful and bored honestly.   my mum would get broken appliances like toasters and would just put my brother in the garden to unscrew and put things back together, gave the rest of us stuff to ruin or put our attention into. we all grew up eventually fairly decent tempered.
If I said ANY of the things Reese said I would get deleted off this plane of existence with no proof of my being there
What my mum did was if me or my brother were naughty she would threaten to send us to our nans (used to hate it cos bedtime was always like 7 or 8 and I was 14 trying to hang out with my mates on the xbox. However if we were on the way home from somewhere the would slam on the breaks pull of to the side of the road and say and I quote "Get out of the car and you can walk home." But there was always a build up she would say "Stop pissing about or I'll leave you here on the side of the road and you'll walk home" but it wouldn't do anything till she slamed on the breaks and it went silent.
Eric cartman did 😂
See this is why. You nip it in the bud from day 1. No way in hell this 4 year old woke up like this on his 4th birthday!!. The child obviously started this at least 2 years ago!!..  Absolutely disgusting 😤 Unless there is Genuinely something wrong with the child! I could try to understand!. But straight out Naughty children!. Noooooo isn't happening in my home!. Some children Genuinely grow up with not much discipline and are great!. While others need it. My eldest son is now 23! He is absolutely 💯 his manners are on point! He is not judgemental of anything or anyone! He has great friends etc etc he did 4 years of law and philosophy ❤❤🙏🙏.  Yet that is also the same child at 2  kicked me in my ankle and punched me in my stomach when I had to correct his behaviour!.. That lasted exactly 2 hours because he did it again but this time I booted him back! Simple! I kicked him back and then told him "I am your mother and you will not do that again! If you do I will kick you back. That ended that! Until he hit high-school.  My son was under the illusion he could talk to me how his friend's spoke to their parents!! Because apparently "they can!?".  So 6 months into high-school my son jumped off his bed got into my face and blatantly told me F##k O##.  I removed that face from mine! Within seconds   Let's just say "his stepdad saved him!  Halfway through.  As a single mom growing up boys into men I believe we have to be Militant or mothers are still going to be scared of their kids!   Nope not me
and i will but im 15 and not planing on it bc in alone
I have same dog 🥺
2:27 "God he's adorable, but I bet he's the worst one"  7:48  you're not wrong, Daz.
Mu parents would talk once and the second time the belt would have a word
Anyone knows moms are crazy scary when they are quiet but you can see they are thinking of ways to beat your ass
I remember something called a belt
4:26 SHE DUCKIN SMOKE SHE DONT WANT NUN
Joe mama
6.9 mil letssss gooooooooo
is that a screew driver
I would eather turn into All Might, Deku, or One punch man and knock these kids into next year
yeah me and my siblings could never act like this. we got tore upppp. didn’t think we had skin on our butts some days. we also got bit by our mom. we didn’t bite again
“She got em all lined up. Like little n@z!s.” Eeehm? Ok?
When I was about 1 or 2 I bit my dad so he bit me back and i never did it again
When me and my brother were naughty my mum just had to go "RIGHT!" *stands up* and we would RUN and stay silent the rest of the night lmao
Like little Nazis  🤣 😂 😆
I come from an southern American home of hard workers and veteran's if I acted like these kids I got my ass whooped and my face kicked in no tv and no dinner I turned out disciplined and well behaved charismatic and smart because I learned
Uncle how old that young kid is I'll go back to the old age's smack em
I can’t even imagine swearing near my mum nevermind at her without getting me getting slapped into another few lifetime and these kids seem more evil than Satan. 😳
looks like those kids would be planning a early funeral if u had a polish / mexican / asian / islam mom
Mothers be silent but deadly
I HAVE A BOSTON TERRIER TOO
I used to get put on the naughty step, I would have to stay on that step for my age for minutes So lets say I was 9 I would have to stay there for 9 minutes. It was torture!!!!!!!!!
the kid isn't super saiyan, he's super insaiyan.
daz: talks abt story when he bit his sister and his mum bit him. me: wow, wasnt just me with a parent that bit me cos i bit someone
Don't have kids 𝓮𝓿𝓮𝓻
Super nanny was my childhood because my mum would show my brother and warn him that if he continues behaving badly she’ll call super nanny. And that’s why I’m never going to have kids ever, ignoring the fact that I’m asexual, kids are my least favourite thing in the world. And that is not an exaggeration. I had to take a 3 month course in looking after kids last year for college, and I cannot tell you how much I wanted to just walk off. I was fine at it, since I’ve trained pups most of my childhood with my mum, but there’s something about kids that just makes me hate them so much
One word A D O P T I O N 👏👏👏👏
“Yes I am that lonely man with a dog” those simple words made me sub
GIZMOOO 🥺🥰💓💕💖💝💕❤️💜
is it just me who sees this and just wants to punch the brat?-
You have a cute little dog
Every time I watch an episode, I'm glad I never was like that, I was Well behaved...more than my older brother 😂
They don’t need super nanny they need super Asian mum whooping
“Kizz ma willia”  no thank you
the speach at the end was so true i love watching daz i laughed so much through this and im at a really low point in my life now. but i just wish more people were like daz
Daz’s daughter in her room hearing him shout BIRTH CONTROL 👁👄👁
when i have kids i am going to daz for parent support
I am a satanist and u saying “ITS LIKE SATAN” makes me laugh 😂
me: clicks on video to have a laugh also me: learns a life lesson
I thought he was dateing linda
My mom is probably the scariest person you'd ever meet I mean she has a big heart, she never had to yell at us very often and when she did start yelling that's how we knew we needed to shut up or go to our room asap.
When he hit her in the tit, I legit fell back in my chair. That’s how much I felt that😭
Just do what my mom and dad did if I did any thing really bad I was locked in my room the whole day
Mate, put that kid in an muslim household like me yeah. They are getting the the terlik and belt treatment times 10
I remember her appearance in South park Jo frost: no child is too tough for super nanny *a few moments later....* She's in a mental asylum eating her own shit
I slapped my mum once when I was about 6 and I actually nearly cried on the spot. As soon as I realised what I'd done, I just thought "oh shît" and ran to my room
When daz said “nothing, ok that’s what you’ll get you’ll also get my BOOT” I was wheezing
When i was like 3-4 ish my mum put me on a naughty step 1 min later I was in the living room my mum said get back on that step now the one word I said was "NO" it happened every time
My mom caught me vaping and when she saw me she chuckled and smile and said wtf and I never felt so scared she gave it to my sister Bc I said it was hers so me or her weren’t In Trouble and I got it back after lol
If I even swore in front of my parents I would of got sent to military school
I’m 16 if my mother had another kid I would have grabbed the child by the ankles and hung them upside down they striked her like that
I’m glad my father didn’t have steel toe boots, I do though
Part 2
Daz: *Yes before you say I am an lonely single man with a dog*
Daz the Super Nanny!
Like little nazis 😂😂😂😂
I agree with daz  at the end. I live just my mum, my brothers have moved out, dad is always coursing problems (such as calling us druggies) and it’s hard. It’s taking it’s toll, I’ve grew up without a prober father figure… so please if you do get Simone pregnant be there for them, they are you’re kids to, don’t let you’re kids end up like my family
i frickin love super nanny
I don’t know if Daz’s story about mocking his mom makes it even funnier if you remember his family background/ what his mother is like from his other stories 😂
Every time my brother bites me I bite him back 😂 he’s 3
Da doggo is adorable
#JustBeGay 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
95% of the time it’s the parents. Children don’t just pop out bad
Daz you are an amazing person you know that. you transform are days from crap to laughter and joy🥺✌🏼👁👄👁✌🏼
See the problem is the parents give in after a while i grew up in a marine corps family and i knew if my dad told me to got to the corner id do it because i knew if i didnt the punishments would get worse
Did she not think about putting them up for adoption
Introduce ‘the belt’
That mum is just soft on them
“How can we make a British nanny look like a British nanny”
i was like this, then mum threw me against the wall, it worked XD
grab the little kid and yeet him across the room, then he'll change his tone XD
I’m dying of laughter cause it’s so true
What the absolute Hell?  Nah nah. Screw Super Nanny. Get Dr. Phil!!! 😐 These kids are violent!!!
frankly the scariest thing is when your parents say your entire first middle and last name, you either straightened up or heaven was getting a new occupant
Just throw the kid in jail!
Like little nattses
Yet your right you get scared by the face your mums pull you know your going to die
GISMO OMG IF HE NAMED HIM AFTER GREMLINS GISMO DJAHAA
Being a single mum is the hardest and most difficult thing to do , but can be very rewwarding as well !!
✍️Bite them✍️
The video is some sort of a god damn Kitchen Nightmares show but with a adult with children plus I think the dad left the family for a Goood reason.
a few years ago i'd watch supernanny bc of how insane some of the kids were. currently, i'm 17 and half-way through a college course in education and childcare and done some work in schools/nurseries. now, knowing what i've learnt, watching this is heartbreaking to me. i hate to imagine what kind of things have gone on for these kids to behave this way. i hope the family got the intervention they needed.
Hay Daz if u see this I won’t u to play the game from the darkness Bc thay are saying that it is the scaryist game so far
I was a horrible kid and one time I was so angry my dad started tickling me to stop me being angry as hell
Bro just put the children up for adoption
If I did that to my mom. She would woop my ass
OMG DAZ HAS CUTE PUPPO
obviously she's a good mom, but my mom had me and my sister raised us and to me it raises questions hm, i wondre where  that kid learned all those words Why do they need to constantly get her attention, to the point of trying to hurt her all the time etc. like ??? do they not have friends/eachother or as daz said, an Ipad or smth? and if not, where are they learning to call their mother names like that and beat her up like they hate her, when i was a kid ive never throw a tantrum unless i wanted something my mom could easily give ( going to the park, candy, etc.) wouldn't they want to hang out with their mom and like, play boardgames or whatever? they're kids so they should lose energy quickly after all that punching and biting, its just confusing
yeah no i dont want kids anymore
I used to watch your videos all the time and this just popped up on my timeline I’m so happy rn 😂😂💜
Getting caught flipping your parents is the scariest thing ever
Daz speaking gold words 😄
and this is why im glad im gay no pregnancy's
I thought she hit him😅
Really inspiring how Daz tells about his own childhood and parenting experiences. It does scared me a lot when I see children now because they do not look educated. They just look like possessed spawns and it is worrying. Seeing them cursing and calling autorities/parents or teachers names like they were beneath them. That's why I stopped working with them, strangely in just two years, they were angels and excited kids to brats. I hope a lot of parents and futur ones can understand you don't have to be violent, just stricted.  To the younger ones, you may be the next generation, but if you can't help but act like you know everything. That's disappointing and I don't want to know how the world will come to.
My sister is exactly like that little boy💀
My mom would watch super nanny when she was pregnant with my sister so she knew how to handle children   When I was put in time out I would just sit there I didn’t think that I could leave and my sister and I are pretty good kids
Omg my aunties dog is called gizmo and he’s a Beagle I can’t spell
proof that schools will give awards out for anything: i “showed up” to class (better known as attending the zoom and ignoring the teacher 👀) after not attending anything for… roughly three weeks? and the next week i got an award in the mail. like bro i did absolutely nothing what are y’all on?
13:47 this is probably the best advice I’ve ever heard
MY NAME IS REESË AND IT REALLY THREW ME OFF
like little nazis's I CANT XD
PLEASE REACT TO NORRIS NUTS 👏🏻
Forgot about the nanny ngl
Seems like the mom needs a belt
I bet kid is like WHERES THE BLOODY TEA MUM
i remember when i was younger about 7-8 i bit my teacher because he picked me up to remove me from  the class room and i told him i didn't wanna be touched but he didn't listen so i bit down on his hand and he had to go to the hospital because it could have got infected
Hey daz are we going to get some more merch?
Hey daz I wonder how many cups of tea you drink in a day
Personally I think men should have just as much say in whether his child is born or not. Of course if the woman doesn’t want to have the child then by no means does she have to have it. But it’s also preposterous and hypocritical for a woman to say a man has to go through with having a child when he isn’t ready for one either. There’s always this saying of “well you had sex so you have to deal with it”, how come that doesn’t apply to the woman. It really does take 2 to tango and he shouldn’t have to have a child if he isn’t ready for one, the same way the woman shouldn’t have to if she isn’t ready. It’s just as much the mans baby as it is the woman’s. rant over.
How those kids can get away with that kind of behaviour is beyond me. If I did that I wouldn’t be able to sit for the year and be grounded on top of that for weeks.
Hey. Just wanted to take a minute to say thank you for all the laughter you bring to people. I’m going through a divorce rn and am suffering depression but your videos always make me laugh and forget about things. Keep up the amazing work. #dazzlerfor life
i grew up without a father. ive sworn to myself. if i ever have kids im never gonna miss a single moment. im gonna be there for them even if its the death of me. theres so much pain that i faced not having a father and im never gonna let my future kids feel that pain
I agree with that, about a man should not run out on pregnant girls
More Gizmo content please 🙏
If that was me my mother would slap me so hard I’d suddenly be flying.
Why does Daz not post part 2 or some videos or just ended the series?
yoo i thought iggy was dead, turns out daz had him the whole time,,,
69
Normally if kids swear, it’s because their parents did around them
OGs remember him telling that middle finger story several times over the years and it never gets old lol
Ok look daz said that i WE are going to have sex hes vountin on u doint with a LADY bu he doesnt take in min there are people like me GAY so yeah Daz i can get a man pregnant XD
I love Giz he’s adorable
Omg I used to watch super nanny all the time 😂😂
The Nanny: It’s quite disgusting to watch a four year swear…  My two year old sister waking me in the morning: HEY B* MORNING SOSO MORNING B*
the title: DAZ WATCHES SUPER NANNY the real title: DAZ WATCHES MOTHER OF THREE GETS BEATEN BY LITTLE CHILDREN
11:29 he just said “kiss my Willy”
This is when my mother would've implemented something called a ass wooping 3rd degree, extremely effective in all cases
wait “lonely single man with a dog” did i miss a break up?? :(
Those kids just need a good hiding that’s all 😂💀
You told us that mom story before 😂😂😂
I got a catifacat for being the best friend…bish WHA
Hey Daz my fried made a makeup video and it is scary please watch it its called ''makeup in a rush''
I love you daz
I love this dog so much
I've probly havent laght this hard in my life
I was a very weird child, when I was 3 I would bite people toes then my mum bit me back once and I never did it again and now I don’t like feet 🤣
Daz no one is lonely with a dog. Xx
“got them all lined up….like little Nazis” I LOST IT
Gizmo is ADORABLE. omg 💞💞😭😍
Get the 4 year old to fight with mcgreger
Wait daz and his gf broke up:(
If I laid a hand on my mother like this she would of beating the hell out of me and made sure I’d never do it again
OMG when Shannan had to think about her name i said before daz "She had to think about that" HAHAHAHA
Just give the kids a Hispanic nanny , they’ll behave then
You should watch "how clean is your house"
there is something called discipline and ppl need to use it, now a days  i can’t go anywhere without seeing a child being extremely rude and getting there way bc mothers right now don’t want to hit/smack/spank their child bc it’s “abuse” no abuse is when it’s wayyy to much or to violent , there is a difference between discipline and abuse
children can be evil
"he's going to get drop kicked across   the room"                                         - Daz
Daz you should play life is strange before the storm, and Detroit become human!! Would love to see you play those 😄
That dog is adorable 🥺
should get him his own little stand ether next to you or behind you
My mum would have thrown me off a 30 story building if I did that
Lined up like little.. What?????
If I was those children’s Parent I would be like: “Ok you little shits, I’m this close 👌 to putting you up for adoption”
The doggo is so cute
3:57 DAZ: gasp!!! Me: Oh shit it's about to go down *as I choke on a breakfast burrito*
Part 2
Daz watches please react to ritz by lucii

Sooooooo cuteee!!!!!! Daz + Phasmophobia = funny ass video ^^
5:19 the same thing happened to me 🤣🤣🤣
she looks like an Ikea sofa ahahahhh
Your dog so cute
I never comment on videos but I just wanted to say that Daz, you are so funny and relatable. Down to earth, understanding and a very genuine human being. Thank you for always making me laugh with your videos. ♥
What happened to the 2 white dogs you had in your vines
1:35 people dont like authority they wanna be the boss das why
My mum tip slap the child if they hitting
I'm not a disobedient kid but what's a stern mother? All I know is a stern father.
AHHhH HES BITING!!! 😂😂
The slap will help 😂😂😂
Loved that last speech❤️
DAZ IS THE NEXT SUPER NANNY🤣🤣
I can no longer take the show seriously after hearing Nick Frost narrate it😂 Keep thinking he’s gonna burst into a Cornetto trilogy quote or something
GIZMO ❤️
WHO ELSE THINKS DAZ SHOULD REACT TO DANCE MOMS LMAOOO?
Daz who needs a women when u got a dog
part
The videos always funny but the end messages actually this needs to be heared
Just hit the child already 😭
🤣🤣🤣🤣
when my mom was really angry at me as a kid. she would get these wide crazy eyes, bare her teeth at me and spoke in a deep tone. terified isnt even a good enough word to describe it. you bet my kid ass behaved right away
When I was younger I had a naughty spot and it was the bottom step of the stairs. Normally if I was being violent or rude and got sent to the step I would ask for a book. And yes my mum would give me a book and then after I wouldn’t be violent or rude
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE TURN IT UP.
12:52 I'd throw him in the lake if I was her
Super nanny legendary
I have some parenting advice for the mum. Slap the child into another dimension.
can you play houes its a scarie game that is pretty good
The mum sounds like a guy 😂
Daz looks so happy with Gizmo ❤️
JUST FOOKIN WOOP EM
The kids are driving the mum crazy I swear
DAZ I HAVE A DOG NAMED GIZMO TOO, he is a shitzu and is black and white🤩
This is GOLD*
Dang. Solid life advice on sex, pregnancy, and responsibility. I love your videos Daz! They always cheer me up :)
10:00 do you mean…. Super Satan?

OMG GIZMOOOO🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
6.9 mil subscribers
All my mom has to say to me is "ok, I'll remember that" or just give me a sweet smile and laugh...that shit is terrifying..
Hello there
Seriously daz u stole my dog's name geez my fav u tuber has the same dog's name as me jeez I'm scared
When even the thumbnail makes you laugh you know he is funny.
Super nanny: “The kids are acting disgusting” The watchers: “REALLY!!!!”
They should make a NAUGHTY STEP because I thought I was gonna die there literally just put your child on I step 😂 if it doesn’t work get a gate 😂
They say blue is the most complimentary color for camera.  Jonbenèt Ramsey's mother always carried a blue dress in case she had to go on camera, if some one would have admitted to killing her daughter. So her husband said.
I watched super nanny when I was a kid and it works never want kids 😂 also love Jo Frost she has no kids herself but tells everyone else how to raise theirs shes brilliant 🙌
Daz your dog is super duper cute I adore him ❤️❤️ have a nice day
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT FOR MY WHOLE LIFE  *screams like dream*
DAZ YOUR DOG IS SO CUTE 🥰🥺😂
I know this will sound bad but... I would throw that kid across the room if he bit me
DAZ watch pager place I think it will change ur mind on pagents
Doggy
This is the best vid ever!!!!!!!!
Wait a second. Single? ☹️
The puppy is SO CUTEEEE😘😘😘😂😂
Please watch more supper nanny
Does games play dark deception the new update is out
Gizmo looks like he's possessed by a Victorian orphan boy.
My mum has 3 kids
OMG THAT NOISE AT 7:20
One of the favorite videos I've ever seen from him funny and drop some truths at the end love it
I have NEVER wanted before kids but this has helped me decide that I will never want kids in the future either😅
6.9 mil subs nice😏
7:13. DAZ THAT'S A DART IN PRETTY SURE
Yo is that Iggy for jojo bizarre adventure
3:29 Lol
cute dog
The Nanny is related to JOJO SEWAAAA😂😂😂😂
That’s when you know you’re gonna die- Daz 2021 I felt that to my core
some kid is getting dropped kicked across the living room ...parenting 101
Did you find it hard talking with that spit holding your lips together? ;p (only joking, luv ya x)
Gizmo: oh no hooman’s onto me
if they were my kids id smack the disrespect out of them
I have a Boston terrier and they are amazing dogs. They are super smart and intelligent. Highly recommend getting one of them. Daz has a cute one.
where the fuck did the frenchie cone from
There’s a reason for every single thing a child does. Sometimes parents project issues onto children. They’re not born like this.
When Daz told the story about biting his sister, I could relate. I bit someone at daycare before and I came home and my Mom bit me (not hard) and same like Daz I never but anyone again
When I tell you I never, ever disrespected my Russian mother. Yeah their silent stares are horrifying but have you ever had your mothers CHARGE at you?! like some bull (sorry mom for comparing you to a bull) ?! you rethink your life in those few moments...
Im sorry daz my delivery for food hasnt come yet and i need milk for tea but i will have it soon
Awe little gizmo❤️❤️
GIZMO!
😃i once got put in the naughty corner like 5 6 years ago and it was right next to a window and i would just look out and i found a fight like on our street and i was so attachedf and my mum was like "aight alisha get up" and i was like "hold on a sec" she got scared for some reason and was litterally draging me out of that spot as someone got slapped- i was like O-O T~T rlly mother?
This is kinda sad it’s a single mother with possessed children and can’t even get a break to herself her stress level is probably through the roof
TF wrong with the doggo eyes
daz please make parenting classes even if it costs money
U should watch Nanny 911 as well
I thought daz was with someone?
When u like with a 4 year old u dont give options u just giv hem/her food
She’s got them all lined up…….. like natzis
my dog lowkey is like this no joke she think im her chew toy and just bites me claws me and jumps on me  i have loads of bruse's and scratches from her
Mom hands hurts the worst
At 9:28 is very true
2 days ago early for me
Daz you should be the next super nanny!!!!!
I havnt seen gizmo since when daz first got him so seeing him so big made me smile 😊
if I tried to slap my mom she would have caught my hand and pinned me to the ground
I have loved Daz for years and this made me laugh so much!
Nothing scarier than when one of your parents puts their fist in their mouth
i feel kacey way too much i lost my childhood at 6 when my siblings were born and it’s made me so mature. Even if i’m only 11, i’ve never got much attention after that and it’s made my mental health drastically worse.
Daz:BLO....DY JEESUS
I do not agree with birth control
Is it ok if I have coffee
I also have a dog called gizmo
What the heck I was thinking about handcuffing him them Daz say it in his video. Daz be reading my mind🤣 for some reason this always happens to me
Love it!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
6.9 million subscribers. “Haha, nice”
DAZ DO VIDEO WITH YOUR DOG NOW
Day 1 of asking for daz to make a story mode series of gta5
Dazs words of advice at the end 👌 to all boys and men...please listen
My brothers  dog is named gizmo
I thought you was with SoheilaClifford
i forgot about you :0
Life lessons with daz
I feel so bad for Casey.. That poor child
My two favourite shows put together.
their dad went for the milk
DOG!
I decided to never have kids when I saw how horrible my siblings treat my parents, I'm pretty sure I'm the only one of thier kids that hasn't disappointed them. But also watching these shows make me not want to have kids.
This was all the birth control I needed.
My grandma died now my grandpa is the  lonely single man with a bichon frisée that he loves more than anything
I had a Boston terrier named gizmo also
Bro if I would've hit my mom I would've got a hand to the back of my head and why doesn't she just spank them
Thank God I'm gay.
“Birth Control we all need it” -Daz Sept 29,2021
I love Daz sm, his videos are the best and ALWAYS make me lol 🌙
The silence of an angry mom, doubled with the death glare, is the scariest thing ever
IGGY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
They need a southern nanny... That will straight them out.
“And Joe is dressed like a iKeA coUcH.”
Says the man with things pinned on every surface space on the walls behind him
Lets get to 7 mill
Pls review another supernany plsss
All I can think during this video is where is the belt
The funniest point was the story of dazzes mum moment, and it’s sweet when he said he wanted to help ☺️
I would have been slapped so hard I would die and be reborn
That dog is my will to live OMG THE DOG IS SO CUTE
Daz is an amazing person with amazing advice
Daz's advice to both men and young boys was so very well said, i hope they will learn from it.
The fact that she won't hit her children-     My mother would've hit me with a stick break it and beat me with another one.
awww i love ur dog
WELCOME BACK TO DAZ GAMES AND ANOTHER DAZ WATCHES ... birth control
“Pull my hair back and put me in blue” daz 2021
At 4, he's definitely learning those words from his mom.
Omg can you watch more of these.
Daz you should react to seagulls song by yoda then watch my stick song
My kids tell me :  Me yelling- no problem  Me silent- scary  Me ultra calm and logical (Spock mode) - terrifying
those kids really need Jesus, damn, I can’t even live with those kids
The way daz just mocks his mom was amazing lmao
if I acted like that to my ma she would've beat my ass up and down the street and same thing from my dad when he got home
Awwww Gizz is a sweetheart
Nothin a good hit with the belt can’t fix
WATCH DHAR MANN
Did anybody look at daz mouth
i am very surprised how Daz can make a 15 minute video out of a 2 minute video
Y o these kids aren’t even that bad WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I BIT KIDS DUDE- I WAS THE FUCKING DEVIL  The school was so concerned that they put me in therapy during school hours  Oh my god if my mum brought super nanny into the house - like oh my god I think she’d break
Watching this during a test lol
Flippin demon children lol.
girl: *hits mum* daz: BLOODY JESUS 😆
the two girls would probably be considered Irish twins
No no no u see if my mom starts talking our home language my bags are packed imma chill by the mc donalds drive way
Love how he pointed out how there’s every space with sum pinned when his background
Ark
Good job to the mom for not beating the shit out of the kids
What a cute little doggy.🙂
"AHHH! HE'S BITIN'!" That was just perfect XD
My name is Kaycee too (It might be Kasey or Casey)
I know it's not my place to say but I think your door would look better in white. The orange/brownish color against the black walls and white trim kinda is distracting because it just looks weird.
I cannot imagine what would happen to these children if my parents or even my grandparents took care of them for a month. They'd be fixed in the first week I'm telling you.
I was WAITING for this video I needed it on my life
no bc my mom did the same thing to me and i never bit my sister again😭
Shock collar or taser
If my son ever does that imma show him my back hand
7:48 my mom would beat me
4:45 the teacher behind me when I wonder why my friends stopped laughing 😂
Hi all
OMG I LOVE GISMO SO MUCH 😭😭
6:32 she went ultra instinct
I do not agree with all of Supernanny's tactics but she has done great things
I give the mum a month before she’s dead 😂😂😂
I made a face behind my moms back once and she turned around and I immediately stopped and she gave me the look and went 'is that what we're doing now' with the look and that was the first and last time I EVER did that😭
English family:NO NAUGHTY BALLKAN family:🙂🩴 u wanna fuckin die
Ya sometimes the time out corner doesn’t work it made it worse for me and my mom she forgot me there for an hour and I was standing there trying not to cry. Then I started resenting her and I still kinda don’t like her cause of other things she has done over the years.
Daz you and Gizmo need to watch its me or the dog. Supper nanny but with dogs
Omg yes I love supernanny
I love ur dog
bark
00:18 he aint a plant xD
Only thing u need to do is to make a kid good give him a beating when he acts up
Gizmo is so adorable!!
Daz should be the new super nanny
if you dont mind me asking where is sarahs mum
we can't subscribe
PUPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!
So close to 7 million!
Awwww cute puppy ❤
If I was bad in public my mum would put me on a harness and it was the most embarrassing thing whenever It was after school and my friends saw me on a harness honestly worst punishment
I remember when gizmo was a puppy
My mum used to put me on a naughty step when I was younger  she stopped when i was about 6 I lived there until I was about 13 I could never walk up the stairs without looking at the step
at the beggining he said to his dog i fed u i walked u and i WATERED U
reason number 237 why not to get kids
I just realized that the super nanny looked like Mrs Trunchbul from Matilda
I would love to see more of gizmo please.
Can u do a dog vid
Women themselves are becoming birth control enough these days 🤣
I was a shit of a kid but I turned out alright 🤣 I’m now 20
Tea party
0:15 "I fed u, IVE WATERED U" lmaooooo the dog some plant or sum???
daz;shes got em all lined up children:by order of the galactic teddy youre under arrest nanny
What he says abt not walking out on ur kid is true and this vid had me laughing until I had a astmah attack
We used the naughty corer as a sensory corner to make me calm down when I was overloaded until I was 9 instead of a punishment, it wasn't "TIME OUT!!" it was "come on, calm down time"
If I ever tried to beat  my mom like that i’d be dead meat
“DAZ WATCHES SUPER NANNY” I already know this is going to be hilarious 😭
Our dogs share the same name. ▼・ᴥ・▼
I swear your helping me a lot today because I've gotten yelled at by all my teachers and mom and I have to clean my room and your videos are helping me get through the day 😂
I had a dog named Gizmo as well!!!!!
Is anyone else just waiting for daz to play the new life is strange???😭
THE LIKES ARE AT 69k WOOOO FUNNY NUMBERRRRR
Very well said at the end better sex eduction than most schools, youre a good man Daz.
The dog: one☝️eye 👁️ open 👐 when⏳im🐕‍🦺sleeping 😴 one ☝️ EYYYÆ
If I did that to my mom, I wouldn't be able to sit for a week with a bloody lip!
I love you Daz!
The way he told the camera to take care of the kids was inspirational
“Clean your room, it’s a pig stye” I thought I was the only one 😂
If daz has years of pacience then he needs to be a shiny hunter in the pokemon games
Hey Daz I know this video is old but you should react to STFU by filthy frank
The look of mums is like Luigi death stare.
its literally impossible for me not to laugh at one of your videos, no mater how sad i am
my teacher was watching you at school !🤣🤣 in class.
69 k likes noice
im here at 69k
She could’ve just tied up the naughty ones
Oh hell no. If I were that child's mom then I would have pushed him down the stairs or slapped him a couple times. My mom never let that kind of behavior slide when me and my sister were kids.
“But I also flipped her off.” THE ACT OF HOW U DID IT IS KILLING ME HAHAH
OMG YOUR DOG GREW HOLY FUCK
I got fax mercy for my birthday. I love it the hat is badass
Daz’s attitude is amazing
Oh my god, this was me and my family 15 years ago. Was a laugh watching this but that mother of mine done an amazing job especially to show it to the world!
Life lessons 😌
Nice amount of subs
Whys does she look like miss trunch bull from Matilda  Edit her names joe
This kid, look at him now, CONNER MCGREGOR, all because he wanteda human punching bag.    And this girl, look at her know, RONDA ROUSEY, all because her brother beat her mother up, she did too
In Australia the parents just fucken slap the hell out of you
If I did that I would have my PlayStation broken and my phone taken away until July next year
Them: *shouting at their mom*  Me as a black girl: may his soul rest in peace🙏
You must watch Supernanny full episode
i swear i saw this family a while ago in Sainsburys XD
got to wonder how the mom parents her children considering how they act, its really easy to blame the children and say that they are "just like this" because their not. its kind of scary because if the children think hitting is okay than the mom probably does the same. children mimic the parents behavior meaning that they copy things like swearing and hitting. another weird thing is that in almost all cases its a single mom that is in this situation.
My fav part for today's video is the intro! Not only that Daz...as soon as u said the first thing about the super nanny I had to laugh 😂 He's always making me smile and Shannon nearly forgot her age. And so do I,like school man just school erases my memory and the young boys name what was it ? He acts like both of my brother's just COMBINED!!
Daz, you’ll always be a kid
First
I literally can’t put in words how amazing Daz is
Why would any parent want a vid of their kids harassing them on the internet 🤔😂
Dog
My mom was angry about my siblings and I hitting each other, not really fighting but punching the other on the shoulder every so often. She got us to stop by saying she would feed us chicken feet if we hit each other again. We never really hit each other like that again
Hey daz i have a horror game suggestion for you it's called dead of night i won't spoil too much but it set from the point of view of a real actor
when he said i watered you i watered you i thought you grabbed a bucket full of water and chucked on him
joe mama
I feel so bad for Casey, the oldest girl. You can tell how quiet she is because of the situation, it's so upsetting... poor thing:(
whats this? a poor mans goggle box! and your still a lonely man with a dog!
I’ve been waiting years for this and it’s finally here 🥳
All lined up… like little natiz😀
Daz posted let’s go
Yooo
Omg Daz I can't breathe bc of the comedic commentary 😂🤣 My husband is looking at me strangely
whenever i was being naughty when i was younger my dad would go “that’s it, i’m calling santa and i’m telling him to bring you coal” and i’d be like “NOOOOOOOO” and i’d behave straight aeay
Like little nazis 🤣🤣🤣
I’m cracking up
why is no one talking about his dog it is so cute
When i tell you ive been waiting for this
daz ia a jojo charecter
However daz can come up with these ideas out of his head is mad crazy I can never it takes me like 280 minutes
Daz: “Omg these kids are satan, they’re just beatin the shit out of everyone!!”
You always make me laugh😄😄😄😄😄😄😄
WHAT THE DOG DOIN
Bro watered his dog
i love your dog Daz!
ALMOST 7 MILLION🎊🎉🎊❤️‍🔥
das giveing us the sex talk lol🤣
You are the best
Umm gets 2weeks I will be Dead
omg i have a little dog too, and lemme tell you, he is satan, and he the man of the house, his name is Gizmo as well
Daz you gained more subs because of your dog
Let me tell you now if that was me my mom would have beaten my ass!!!
That was a lovely heartwarming speech daz, thanks man
I love how, he brings his own experience of being a parent.
I'd like for Daz to rename his channel to "Daz Shiny Shoes Games"
is it me or is daz getting funnier every single day 4:31 this is where i started laughing uncontrollably
Honestly nothing helps more then a good belt to the buns in this situation.
React to happy tree friends
it’s like material arts class in there
My name is Rhys 😂😂😂💀💀
hahahahahahahahahahah
“Like a curtain” DAZ I CANT 😭
The light flickering means somebody is trying to kill you imagine the power this kid posses just mom yell and sends you to your room and you flicker the light get your red paint and blame mom
What kind of a award is shiny shoes? Who thought or even recommended that?
Reminds me of when I was out the other day and there was this kids screaming non stop up and down the shop for a good half an hour until they finally left the mother didn’t even acknowledge the child
“Make sure to be on your best behavior” doesn’t last forever anyone with siblings or kids knows this for a fact.
Okay I’m not the only one who talks to their dog, noted! good to know…
What am I even watching? What am I looking at?
Super nanny: can make any kid behave  Me: Nan is that u?
7:46 "ooh that kids gonna get drop kicked across the living room"
Daz is so bad, my video so better
Let's admire the fact that the dog is watching both the cam and daz at the same time
yesss super nanny is amazing, glad he reacted to it😂😂❤️
I hate super nanny, I've seen some episodes where she is straight up horrible. At least for me.
I got my tea ÛvÛ
8:02 I can agree. When my mum gave me or my brother a death stare I'd shit myself XD
🤯 I cvjcghnhfgnnhgd
Watching at 6.9M subs 😏
is that a jojo reference
Awwww doggo is adorable🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
Why is the wee dude taking inspiration from luie saurez the footballer that bites guys
Is kaisy im rease   In deep voice im Sharon
Me: Hey Daz what’s your kink?  Daz: Pull my hair and put me in blue.
I was raised with a mom who never said what she didn't mean. When I was young, I realized that you don't interrupt, or you get popped in the mouth, don't curse out your mom or you get slapped in the floor, and knew how to give that stern look. Hell, she still does, almost thirty years later. It's what made me the good woman I am today. =)
This video made a very horrible day... A little better. Thank you.. Daz ❤️🌸
Ngl all day me and my friends have been saying in ur voice "its fucking fanta"
At 2:46 I thought he is going to take a blue mug
awww cute doggo !!!!!
when my mom dose the look she jusg keeps starring its kinda creepy 😬
may i ask where the mom is to daz kid
Move over daz, all hail gizmo
This video made me laugh and it made me cry and it mad me angry cuz the kids what’s wrong with me 😭😅😅
10:00 daz looking cross- eyed! Love it!! 🤣
Calll the dog Linda

He has to do a part 2 and watch the episode with megan
Oh my god my dogs names called gizmo
Hi Daz, Please could you react to 'the red dress' it is a 'very good' song 😂 Thanks :)
Your dogs name is gizmo my First pets were Ginny pigs and one of them were called Gizmo.
Only daz can make a 2 minute video into a 15 minute video😂
How does she get money?????
Daz: supper nanny        Me: *who watched almost every episode*
I love how much respect he has for the mum, my mum got abused by my dad growing up, she struggled emotionally, physically and financially, she would go in on certain days to get chicken for us because it would be on offer, we were unbelievably poor but everything I ever wanted she got for me, we used to go to car boot sales and if we got enough we would go to the cinema as a treat, in conclusion I LOVE ALL U MAMAS AND U ARE AMAZING
7 MILLION BABY!!!! ON OUR WAY!!!
Who else saw gizmo on his story I loved it    It was so funny and cute
I too have bitten my sister when I was younger lmao
The little boy:”SHUT UP YOU FAT FUCKA” Me: HOW DA FAWK DID HE NOT DIE?!
I wouldn’t be able to handle kids like that it angers me just watching it
They must have gone to Shenley school because they have the uniform on, I used to go there but I don't remember them
“ Pull my hair back and put me in blue” 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂
You ever wanted to slap a child so much before?
If that mom was South African, for every swear word that 4yo said would get a slap with a plakkie in the face, or pepper in the mouth
I don't rimember the dogs name I'm so sorry /hj. But what's with his ears? Are they flipped like that and you gotta help him out and flip them back? Or did the person who have him to you as a puppy tape them? I hope they didn't tape them
0:01 iggy?
Me….. ✨I’m gay✨
I HAVE A BOSTON TERRIER ASWELL
Ur dog looks like iggy from jojo (not really but kinda)
Oh good golly, if I ever behaved like that, my parents would slap me so hard, make me run a marathon, and then make me sleep outside. 😂😂
Or vasectomy. Birth control Is a no for me.
geeze are you single again mate?    to bad you didnt live in canada  wink wink!   honestly though, love your show

Also if I did this shit to my mum I wouldn't see the next day 💀💀💀
7:48 I love how he tried to slam the door and it didn't even shit 🤣🤣🤣
Come on 7mill
Why does he sound like a Facebook mom saying bless her
Gizmo has no thought behind those eyes
I love this so much easily one of the best Daz watches EVER!!!!!!!!!!
God forbid my kids do this
I watch some of these and I want to beat the children 😂☠️
My volume listening to daz watches 📈📉📈📉📈📉

Upload the banned horror game pt 2 daz I'm itching to see the rest
Can you please do a series of super nanny x
just slap them then they wouldn't do it again
You would not see this where i come from(Korea) You can try any if this once and get beat to hell and back and you will never do that again. teachers also use physical punishment and on top it's in front of the class so humiliation. all these things make sure all the kids in  Asia keep good behaviour.
What happened to Bob
The mom should slap them back to teach them it's wrong. saying no litteraly nobody listens to when there are no consequences.
gizmo be like: O_D
Gizmo is the holy dog
The end got me laughing as I known  ima die a virgin
“ Joe Frost ” my surname also being frost - 😎

Smacking children isnt the answer ,,unless you have kids like this 🤷‍♂️
69 funnie number
"how can we make a british nanny *voice goes rlly deep* LOOK like a british nanny" I'm dead
The mom face was on point
Your  at 6.9 mill dazz
daz talking abt how u need paitence with spiteful kids is so true. I was a very violent child because I had nothing else against my older sister. I couldnt defend myself with strenght or anything else, so I'd hit her. I was very explosive. When I was in diapers, whenever something didn't go my way, I'd start banging my head against the table real hard. Like twenty times in a row. I grew out if it, by the age of six, I was a very meek and kind child. Please don't hit your children, communicate with them.
loved this episode. I love when Daz has genuine advice at the end. I feel so bad for this mother, she clearly has nobody. I hope she finds help. Would love for Daz to finish this episode.
Part 2
full time punching bag 🤣🤣
I love daz he's so funny man
These videos keep getting better and better!
The mum look is terrifying... I did something similar too, and my mum just ... 0-0 I brought down all my electronics and sat on the step for an hour... Just DIY punishment you know?
Sometimes it’s okay to kick a child🤚
That was a 🧑🏻‍🦲thump🧑🏻‍🦲- Daz black 2021
About the silent mom thing- we would go to church and as a kid I was pretty good, but when I’d act up in church, mom couldn’t say what she’d usually say. So she would just rub my back, but in like a scary “stop that shit right now or I’m taking you out”. Not a word and still the most terrifying experience imaginable
There was more talking from u then the video
Ok.. I have a recommendation for Daz to play 'Doki Doki Literature Club!' and 'Jeff the Killer: Horrendous Smiles'
If I had kids and they behaved like that I would just slap the shit out of them
I can't be the only one who thinks the nanny is dressed just like miss trunchbull from Matilda 🤣
His dog at the start is so cute
Best video yet 😂😂😂😂 Daz you can make anything funny 😆😆😂😂
throw him on the sofa
“Sometimes even the dogs” frig off 😭😭
What happened to Billy? Sorry if I missed something we were left on a massive cliff hanger.
“She got them all lined up, Like little nazis” 🤣😂
It's that dog from JoJo!
Where part 2 of that game u played that was banned 🥺 I love the horror game plays 😘
Ngl Daz might actually be a better SuperNanny lol, legit he understands children.
my respect for Daz after this video: 📈↗️
Some kids need a really good slap across the face.
"I'm not mental" 😭😭
I wanna see how the nanny deals with these children so badly and if it works
I spat my tea out watching this I laughed so hardd!!
my name is reece too, and this was what i used to do as a kid too lmao
Anyone else just thought of giving the poor mum a belt. BOOM no nanny needed in the first place.
GIZMO IS SO FUCKING CUTE DAZ <3
Please do more of these aahahah
Can you please play ark again
Daz is amazing and  has similarities to John wick lonely with a dog AMAZING
Every comment is about DAz. What kind of morons are watching this show?
Part 2 please
Joe frost is dressed like a ikea couch XD
Its easy to deal with these kids just get the belt and hit them hard as shit and then they turn into a angle after that
My kid would've hit the wall. The one 20 feet away.  👊
As a psychologist in training I have learned that the psychology behind childhood development and it’s so bloody complicated. Kids are constantly learning and growing. These kinds of behaviours usually stem from poor teachings from the parents. And it’s not always the parents fault they teach their kids these behaviours. In circumstances like this one it’s so difficult for the parent especially single parents
I love Supernanny
bitten by another mum!!!!🤣🤣🤣
All I had to do was look at the thumbnail to know this was going to be a good video 🤣
HE HAS A BOSTON PUPPY TOO!!!
Wait omg you should react to dance mum's
rhys frost unno
YOUR DOG IS SO CUTE
I subscribed ✌ uploaded new video about forex trading 👋
shiniest shoes certificate, Daz? were they...dazzling? 👞
🤣 she’s got them all lined up like little nazis! Dark but really funny!
I had a naughty step that mum did. I put myself on the step when I knew I did something wrong. My parents would walk past confused like,’why are you on the naughty step’ and I’d be like,’ I drew on the wall’ they were just like,’ okay then🤷🏻‍♀️
You should watch the Bruno family episode of super nanny
I love how he said I watered u to the dog 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
BLO.  TTY.    JE.    SUS.
I love Daz ❤ 😍
Watch Daily Dose Of Internet Their Amazing
Those childern NEED to be DISCIPLINED. PHYSICALLY. The mother should have snuffed their negative and aggressive behavior out the moment it started. Now they're running all over her because they know she won't do anything to stop it. The mother needs a good man in her life and children need a father figure. May God Bless Her, Her Children, and the Man who may come into their lives and help them all.
Fock yeah Daz at 4 am!
Hey Daz, i just want to bless your heart i know it is stressful raising a child by yourself and a dog and for you to take the responsibility to do that is just a blessing because some men/ women who have left a man/women's life and don't care if they end up on the streets or have cheated on that person and it is stressful and upsetting for people to do that and so i just want to bless your Daz as you and your daughter get older and take on more responsibility's
Never liked pugs, no offense but the way that dogs eyes are almost escaping their eyesockets just freaks me the fuck out. They look cross eyed. Like their eyes can't commonly focus on one thing, one eye looks to the west & one to the east.  I feel bad for these dogs.  Not sure what exact breed Daz has on that dog, but whatever it is, stop breeding it, for real.
what da dog doinnnn?
Wait who’s joe
The dad went for milk
Love to all the single parents 🙏  Liked that you didn't judge her as I know it's really hard when kids get out of control x
This is why spanking is neccesary. In South Africa we have a sayin :” Wie nie hoor nie, voel” it means :” those who dont listen, feel”
Hi daz my name Jim  I like horror games
I agree with this daz about boys getting girls pregnant and leaving just stay and grow up. But the whole be a man thing being toxic isn’t true there still gonna act like kids when there older we got some parents that act like children because they never stepped up grown up and accepted responsibility.
best cid ever on your channel lol
BLOOdy JEsus lmaooo
these kids are SATAN!!!!!!!!!!
Right so hear me out. Watch the super nanny episode with Megan and then him reacting to her now as she's on tiktok
when u said like little nazis u had me
daz, you should react to Nikocado Avocado
I remember Daz telling the middle finger mom story in another video, forgot which one 😂
Can we all take a moment to thank Daz for being kind and funny and cheering us all up on a bad day. Daz is like the dad that I’ve never had but always manages to go an extra mile to make quarantine a shit ton better for us! Thank you, Daz :)
This is the reaction video we’ve all been waiting for.
3:58 when you go in the toilet after you dad just got done in there:
Not to be dramatic but I would die for Gizmo
No it's so scary when they say what did you say but quite scarest shit ever
No one noticed his subscribers number
*Your Video sucks!* Cause these quick switches from you to the Nanny-Scenes. ~ Thats Brainwash! ~ Do you want to be the focus or the topic about you are talking about?
#45 on trending my ass
9:17 I would have honestly got slapped across the mouth
ur dog looks like iggy from jojo
You should do another one Daz this video was a banger
More Gizmo Love!!! 💖💖💖
Hey daz can you react to Misha he is a singer
This is so funny. Omg Daz! Wife swap next…🤣
Awww the doggie is soo cutee!
It’s like my 5 year old nephew but high on candy and worse
"No kid has ever gotten the better of her, she's the best nanny ever."  Me: "nanny mcfie is that you?"
Yes I have my lemon and mint tea daz
me being gay xxx
Ah, I remember watching this a fair amount when I was younger. Man, it’s interesting watching back and uh… yeah 😂😂
14:43 i under stand what your saying but what if you are way too young for example being a teenager?
What do you want on your sandwich? NOTHING!!! Gives two pieces of bread
Best Daz video by far. Cant stop laughing
I remember i used to watch her when i was young thinkng it was so cool how she transformed children like that 😜
10:01 …
Reese had a dart in his hand
“She’s got them all lined up like little nazi’s” 😭💀
I've never really been in trouble, I mean i can count a few times but usually my dad punishes me and fuck me I remember one time i ran to my parents room got under their thick blankets and hid in a pile of clothes hiding from my dad, Lets just say it didnt last very long.
One of my favorite dog breeds 💜
Just beat the kid when he dis behaves as easy as that  Take notes from African and Asian parents
give this dog a premotion!       spelt that wrong didn't i?
I have been watching for so long he the best
This is great love daz best YouTuber Ever
"She's got them all lined up like little nazis" HAHAHAH
This is really ramdom..... but like Daz eyes are so pure👌💕   THEY'RE JUST SO PRETTY
Daz Your dog is so cute 😊😊😍😍
They say dogs and their owners look alike
I’m so glad he’s backed not having kids for housing over in England 🙌🙌  But this is one of the problems with not being able to punish kids like you used too. Lose loads of respect and manners
Daz: some kids are just impossible Pageant kids: and I took that personally
0:01 dog 💖
My dad did the exact thing that Daz explained, I am an only daughter with my mother and my lil doggo, it’s difficult because I don’t get the amount of attention needed for me and I’m always going to my grandparents or 5 hours every weekend every holiday so my mother can work, my father doesn’t pay child support either, and doesn’t come to court which means I can’t see him, it sucks and men and younger boys out there please don’t do that to any woman or your child if possible
im crying now his dog has the same name as my dog from my childhood and it got taken away
Sounds like she smokes 50 a day
When i was put on the naughty step i just sat there and cried
Can u plz go back to play some of your old games
I'm dying hahahaha  "Running up your energy bill mum" 😂😂😂
I mean listen. .I'm not an advocate for corporeal punishment whatsoever. All I'm saying is that's what I got and I never would have dared act like these kids.
Me wearing blue while watching this: 👀
He's an ankle biter 😂😭
God I remember I yelled at my mom and she  cussed at me then slapped me it the face not hard just like you know  and she said talk like that about me again I can not imagine doing this to her she she would have put me up for adoption maybe
If I ever raise a hand to my mom she would have beat the crap out of me
My mom would've beaten my ass without a second thought
Forget Mary Poppins, or Doubtfire. We got Joe.
"Iv watered you"
If your girl is pregnant and you are not ready for it... Just have an abortion... Right?
you should react to life of luxury, i think it would be a good daz watches
If I ever flipped my mum off I would never see day light again😂
Ah, yes, my daily dose of birth control.
The problem is.... no father figure.
I used to watch super nanny all the time on yt, and I think the kids I've watched contributed to my anger issues today. :D
Don’t worry, Daz. I’m a lonely single woman with a dog 😅*Boston terrier as well*
I just wanna *slap* and yell "DHUT THE FUCK UP!"
7:57Thah’s nortEEE 👹
Is it weird I was singing “ceeeeeeeelebrate good times. come on!” During like half the video?
Ive gotten 666 kids pregnant and 911 had babies the others got hit by a brick because I hired a hitman to throw a brick at the babies head
My parents would have beat the shit out of me if I had acted like that…
If I would’ve done ONE of these things growing up I would’ve died or been grounded the rest of my life.
DAZ HAS A DAUGHTER WHAT ?!
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Micheal Myers
I actually wanted to suggest this, and now I'm happy that you're doing it
Anyone elses mom say,"I brought you into this world and I can take you out" when you were little?
Please do a part 2
" Kiss my willy" lmao
Man, that story about flipping your mum off killed me 😆 The stern look was spot on 🤣🤣
They wouldve never been little ass holes if the mum knew how use the hand that was my dads weapon it always worked on me I didn't end up as a ass hole
Jo frost is dressed like an IKEA couch I literally wheezed
If it was an Aussie version: you get you s*** back in line you f***ing c***.
his dog is so cute awww
So cute dog
If my kid bites me, I'm going to put them through a wall and I'll tell them that just through a death stare but I'll never do it.....maybe.
super nanny is a joke her gen z parenting methods usually favor the brats anyway. The moment i first saw her say "you must NEVER spank your child" i knew she was just another pushover. Children need to learn that law and order is non negotiable they either fall in line or get dragged back in. Supernanny's methods if anything encourage misbehaviour because she uses a bartering system over fear. The worst she does is "time out" lmao some good THAT'S done for today's delinquents
Gizmo!!!!
My kid once picked up a potted plant and dropped it on the floor, dead eye staring at me the whole time. So I kept my stare at him, picked his toy up and dropped it from the balcony. and i said "Now what?" He never did that again xD  Another thing he only did once was to call me a turd. Since I can cry on command I immediately broke down crying and asking "why do you hate me?" He regretted it immediately and never called me anything bad ever again.  He is now 13 and has always, still does, help out around the home WITH JOY o.o Never have I ever had to argue about bedtime, food, shopping, or cleaning the apartment. There's been arguments about homework, but that's it.
If I’ve learned anything it’s that if someone bites you just bite back
HI DAZZZZ!!!!!
The thing with this show is that its practically impossible to see how the parents really act because theres a camera and person standing there watching you of course you would restrain yourself especially for youtube. If the parents are constantly shouting or cussing or reacting violently the kids will show that behavior thats a given, you can not fix behavior without finding the root of it.
Kid: Punches What I will do: dodge oh weave SMACK
I remember Daz telling the story of how he flipped off his mom😂
Ok this is random, but parents need to stop hitting kids, it convinces them to hit/bite other kids or adults, It makes them grow up with trauma, violence, And a lot of other symptoms, they could devolop DID, PTSD and other disorders.    I'm not sating that NO punishment is okay, just don't hit kids, I recommend actually talking to them, if there uncomfortable then stop getting in there face. Yelling at them, swearing, kicking, hitting, Or just plain of abusing them is not parenting.   Like i said earlier, yelling or swearing at your children can cause severe trauma, and you swearing,hitting,yelling can convince your kid that its okay and they could get in trouble in schools, grocery market, offices etc, and cause them to get hit more.  I've seen parents "wash" there kids mouth of with soap, hot sauce, etc, Which is NEVER okay to do.  *discussion over—*
Gizmo is so very handsome and is a very very good boy❤️
I would slap the shit out of that kid but that’s y I’m not having kids I’d be in jail
I think I know what’s wrong with kids nowadays the don’t get their asses whooped
Now when I see badly behaved children will I remember this and start laughing. I think it might happen.
>:c i would slap the shit out of the kid or hit them with a fucking  belt hehe >:)
Awwwe that’s the cutest dog I ever seen!
I just know this is gonna be a good reaction, before even watching.
i was drinking water at one point and almost spit it ALL over my bed and computer lol
At the end well said daz
If i did this to my mom, i would get beaten up lol
14:20 just be a father be there for the child grow with them being someone in there life they can always go to like being  parents is hard and it’s even harder when it’s only one ik from living with a single mom (my mom)
daz
whach dhar man
There's a show like this for dogs then there's one for cats and now children 😂😂😂😂
just smack the kids across the face everytime the kids so something wrong they will learn pretty quick
if i were their mother i'd already be looking at the caskets
Wow. Dad is truly the purest human being.
Yeah one of those men that left their gf or wife is my bro he has five kids with different women and he thinks paying child support helps everything but it does
HANDCUFF HIM!!🤣
She should put those to up for adoption        That was a joke btw
white families scare me because i see no discipline 😃
“There is always the option a baby will come as a result.”  Me looking at my mother who’s 40 without a womb: Uhh… I dunno Daz, unless there’s some black magic shit happening over here
Daz you need to do a daz watches for worlds strictest parents
Daz! Please react to Micheal Aldag's song Tonsillitis. It sounds like a parody of a cheesy break up song.... but nope, it's real and people seem to love it. But every time I hear it in an advert I'm just confused and cackling. 🤣🤣
Wow, Daz! u lost a lot of weight! congrats
I wish daz reacts to masked arab. Imma spam till he does
I respected you already before the talk at the end of the video, well near end. But when you mentioned for a man to take responsibility after a girl he has had sex with gets pregnant with his child, that was everything. it's not just the mans responsibility, it's a partnership. you saying that hopefully opened up a lot of peoples eyes, you choose to do something risky even with protection, if it's meant to happen, it's gonna happen. Don't leave the girl to be all alone in this. you both made the choice. Wise words said by the one and only Daz Black.
OMehg me dog is named gizmo
I haven’t watch super nanny in a long time
Single???  I’m on my way!    Actually I’d just like a hug. ☺️
4:16 😂
Every time my godchildren throw tantrums, I throw bigger ones. They want to scream, I scream louder. You want to bite.... well you get the picture. I have become the discipline in their lives, which is scary cause I'm a complete f**k up!
Daz please do a super nanny sketch, it would be perfect🤣👌
OMG dazz you need to watch strive it up TEALAND middle school 😀😭😂😂
Yah when I was little I bit a chunk out of my brothers back like not a big one a small one and he still as a scar, my brother and I are like best friends now.
the second hit would have had me but the kid on the floor softly, put the kids arms on their chest and me lightly on top of them til they calmed the fuck down, then talk about that and if they do it again it won't be such a nice talk afterwards. more of a yell. the first one would have been a warning. like a clear warning. the second, no, no one would like to be hit and the kid certainly wouldn't either. the first thing i think of is taking a calm approach til it gets worse. it's their choice if the kid wants it to go farther than the warning. I'd hope my kids would know to take the first warning in kind and not push it further. But that's just me, what would your approach?
i hated it when we had to stand in the corner and my parents wouldnt let me sit down
Daz games Just got 6.9 million subscribers nice
There is nothing more terrifying than the mom look.
Yesss daz’s dog is just muah 💕😭
DAZ PLEASE FINISH THE LAST OF US PLEASE
i’ve been waiting for this video since i was 9 years old THANK THE LORD
gizmo will take over
ive got a giant black dog named gizmo (prolly spelled it wrong)
(That a baby can always happen) but what if I’m gay
We need more gizmo on the channel.🐕  Period.
I have been watching super nanny for so long and Daz games and I have been waiting for this 🤣
Is that dog A Boston terrier i used to have one before she passed
my cat’s named gizmo after gremlins, she the gremlin colors
Poor lass (both mum and daughter).  Being a single mam is bloody hard work.  I didnt get a choice as my husband popped his clogs in 2012, the aftermath was hell for years (I had triplets and 2 older daughters too).  They're all 18+ now.  There were times when I wish I could have had another parent there to take over so I could breathe.  There is help out there.  I had help from early help services, I went on to volunteer with them and eventually work with them - I now work in the mental health/crisis support field.  Even went to uni in my 40s, couldn't have done that without support.  Contact your local early help team if you're struggling - they are absolute angels.
I don’t see the problem with doing a 360 no scope with my hand into that child’s face like why doesn’t the mom just smack the kid
I would rather have my eardrums bleed from my mom yelling than her sit there completely silent. Just. Starring. That’s when I know my life has ended.
Daz needs to teach sex ed.

More super nanny
I remember when gizmo was a puppy😭
Why is there a door to the living room?
i loved supernanny so damn much growing up
First of all, love the video like all your others so far. Second.... i am from germany so i never really bothered but i recognized the nanny instantly. If some of you ever watched "drawn together", well they had also an episode with the super nanny and they pretty much are the same considered looks and everything
I’m getting the wooden spoon flashbacks
More... PLease... More
Daz is too funny 🤣 😂
Aww your puppy at the beginning is adorable! Also dog babies are much easier to deal with than human babies. 100% nowhere near mentally prepared to have kids lol
Shoutout to my parents who raised me to   be more mature than children in a first world country, honestly
im glad im gay
Yo it's Iggy from Jojo bizarre adventure irl
Omfg the story of Daz flipping off his mum is so fucking funny😭😭🤚🏼🤚🏼
If a had kids like this it's will be time out

13:43 Daz I'm not gonna run out on that kid, I'm gonna raise it to dress up as baby yoda, but mostly raise it to be better than me
Put a black mother on that show as a nanny and watch shit get done quick and in a hurry
Yesss daz but plssss do dark deception part 2 and the new life is strange Is out!
And this is why I'm NEVER HAVING KIDS
Dawg I can’t LMFAOOOOO! ‘My school, because I was failing everything else, issued me an award for shiniest shoes.’
As a person that was with my mom with no dad and a little sister I can understand the mother girl for not getting attention
I have been waiting for this for three years ..
Gizmo bark if you need help
You brighten my day daz, much love to you
Daz you have to play the game 12 minutes
awwwww gizmo is so cuteee
Abortion
E
please play the horror game 'tall poppy' its meant to be really good and only costs £2 :)
Gizmo has the opposite direction Technoblade eyes 😂
So that’s your name that’s why you sounded familiar
i DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE HOW LONG I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS, THIS SHOW USED TO BE MY CHILDHOOD
It’s like Gordon Ramsay, nanny addition.
I don’t know what kind of dog I expected Daz to have, but Gizmo is perfect.
Dax you should react to squid game
Call the Judy chopped gi in
Anyone else remember Daz telling the middle finger story??? I’m getting Deja Vu
I can't fucking breathe this made me laugh so hard
AWWWWWW! How Cute!!!! ( The dog, Daz. The dog)  LOL
OMG NO WAY- I HAD A MARKET PIG NAMED GIZMO - LIKE UR DOG IS SO CUTE I 🧍
Never really been scared of my mum. Even when she tried. I wasnt rude because of it but i definetely challeged her more than my dad because while i love my parwents my dad is definetely the scarier one.
What does the mom mean when she calls the kid a road? 🤔 Like he's going to be stepped on or something? She's gonna run him over with the car? I don't get it 🤷🏻‍♀️
This stressed me out lmao 🤣
If my kid ever hit me like that, we fighting 💀 BITING? You won’t even have baby teeth, just gotta wait until the adult ones come in lmao
That 4 year old is like my 8 year old sister
Wait people can have sex is there a update i missed or something?
👍👍👍😂🤣😆
Aye I remember you telling that story of you pointing the finger at your mum 😅
I used to have a dog named Gizmo but she past away when I was about 4 or 5
I love this commentary so much.
Litterally 30 seconds of screen time for super nanny
What he said at the end hit my heart tho 🥺
Can Gizmo look straight?
That poor mom
I remember this episode when I watched it on DVD, looking at it now, it’s kinda meh, but Daz makes this funny to watch.
I’ve been binge watching super nanny 😂 perfect timing
All I’m saying is u made a 13 minute long video out of a 2 minute clip
5:20 what is that in ur mouth daz?
Daz should be an Inspiration talker
I used to love this show when I was little.
amogus
maybe gizmo is looking miserable because you watered him. Like there are only 3 rules Daz, now Stripe is gonna bully him :(
6.9 million subs and #12 on trending 😳 well done daz good going mate
6.9 million subs and #12 on trending 😳 well done daz good going mate
HOW CAN THIS INSANELY GOOD LOOKING MAN WITH AN ADORABLE PUPPY DOG BE SINGLE?! IT SHOULD BE A CRIME
I love your dog 😍
Daz’s parenting words of wisdom: bite him😭😂
Awwwww doggo is so cute
The boy reminds me of jack from the Incredibles 😂😂
Weird to think most these kids are probably  old enough now to be a fax viewer
If I ever swore at my parents i’de get beat
5:37 Is it just me or did that girls look like she was attempting to do a armbar
This is what I needed after a hard day at work. You make it all worthwhile Daz!!
Daz thank you so much for telling younger viewers about not running out because that happened to me when I got pregnant at 17 and he’s smoking pot and he lives 5 mins away from me and our son is 1 he just turned 1 and it’s hard and it’s lonely at time so thank you for saying that
Daz: I've got my tea, I hope you have as well. Me: Is pepsi okay?
Bite. Them. Back. For. Gods. Sake. Beat. 👏 Your.👏 Children.👏  Its only child abuse if they dont deserve it.           (Theres obviously limits. But you all know what the hell I mean.)
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring back cooking simulator. I need more chef daz in my life
11:29
I got a certificate for leaning back in my chair too much
They are lined up like in the sound of music
The mom looks give you ptsd
7:10 is that a lawn dart?
His room makes the video look like they were made in early 2000s.
RIP daz
at the dinner table my sister and my mum was talking about super nanny and now look
omg when i saw the first second of this video i was like 😮😀
"Some kids gonna be drop kicked across the living room.."   SIR!!.. I DROP KICKED THAT CHILD IN *SELF DEFENCE* .
I need more parts
manlyke daz said he 'watered' his dog lmaooo
If that was me. I would have been kicked to hell by now
the puppy sooo cuteeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So cute the puppy 🐶..
I beat my mom and sister
Lol
My mom made us sit down at 16 and watch super nanny etc and told us this is what you have to put up with with kids...neatless to say im much older and don't have kids 🤣
I’m remembered if I sweared at my parents I would get the soap in my mouth 😂😂
6:33 my mom would have got the chancla and hit me with it 😭😭😭
Daz: “I can see it in your eyes” Gizmo: 👁👄👁
I called my mum a bumhole ONCE and ill never see a wooden spoon the same again, also why i don't like flying HAHA🤣
I LOVE YOU DAZ you make my life 🤘🏻
Daz, your the cool uncle
9:16 boss music plays
Bruh anyone think of iggy when they saws daz’s dog?
Cute doggie
Supernanny is the ultimate reminder to take my birth control 🤣
more .
✨coMdoms✨💀
11:30 thank me after you've wiped your teirs
I know one child this woman would never be able to handle: ✨my brother✨
i think the kids killed the dad
Those kids are probably the kids to grow up and get in gender drama
5:05 man went mike tyson on her
*daz “I hope u have ur tea* *me runs to get Chocky milk* Mha advert plays *me runs back to room “BAKA”
Wait- his dog is called gizmo-? So is mine- i- XD

Dog love is the best love💜
I watch super nanny all the time 😂
The naughty step worked for me I'd just allow it
I love your dog!! So cute!!!
I havn't watched super nanny in 6-8 years.
AHAHAHAHWHEHEHEHEHE I NEED THE DOG
4:42  “Standing there in the corner like a curtain”  Took me out 🤣🤣
"a full time mum and a *punching bag* " that made me laugh. It shows my crap sense of humor.
YO HE BEAT SAPPY NAPPY ON TRENDING YOOOOOOOOO
Yeeeees this is the one thing I always knew I needed
its so crazy how he just made a 15 minute video while watching a 2 minute video
Bite him
Gizmo so cute 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💖💖💖💖💖💖
The switching wifes show for gods sakes daz, you are amazing, very good person daz.. BUT WE WAN SEE THE SWITCHING WIFES SHOW!
I don't need to watch super nanny to not want kids, all I need is my younger brother who is a nightmare.
I find actually working with kids, who aren't yours, is the best contraceptive more than watching something on TV. I worked in daycare for a year before my position was worked out of the building and that was enough for me. I was happy to work with the kids in the daycare, I loved my job and the kids. BUT I don't want any myself. Plus I have a bunch of neurological and health issues; it would be selfish to condem a kid with my problems. Lol
More
I love how the dog was looking at daz and the camera
Sometimes you should use condoms
My mum once threw a tantrum in public when I was busy with one...and I kid you not I NEVER threw a tantrum again...EVER😃😂
This is strangely political
All she needs to do is spank them after a while they will learn what will happen
I couldn't help but notice the spit on his lip the whole video hahaa
AWWW CUTE DOG
2:30 ALWAYS TRUE 🤣🤣🤣
Don’t forget your the funniest single man with a dog
sorry to ask but whos the mum of his daughter??
“I should be supernanny!” Yes please! Lol I’d love to see Daz in a blue dress suit giving parenting advice
GIZMO🥺🥺
9:17 I can 100 percent confirm that look because my mom does that XD but in times like that (the children..) you grab the belt..
Par two please!!!!!!!!
"No child has ever got the better of her" ..but there may have been a little kid who burned his house down because he didnt want a timeout.. but they arent gonna mention that.. ((it was after she left but I still wouldnt call that a success ^-^' ))
My mum was abusive, so if I did any of this then I'd have to say my goodbyes
One good shoe to the face always works
I hate children thank you that is the end of my ted talk
3:58
That child is rabid
Those kids need discipline
who dose not like daz
When daz watches a a 8 minute video he makes it 15.
Daz: kid's goin' super satan......UWEEWERRREEAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!
Her scalp is pulled back so tight she’s now been pulled into her early 20s
Shannon be like- ummmmmmm i think im seven??
Meow- Super nanny ignores cat
LOL---
Hahaha I’m 34 and if my mum gives me that silent look I’m scared, I feel what your saying Daz
If I did this to my mum I’d get the belt shoved up my ass 😂😂😂
holup did he just say kiss my willy to his MOTHEEEER
I have a Turkish mother and one’s i did the same as you she turned right when I had the finger op and you wouldn’t know what she did to me
Got a certificate for the shiniest shoes 😂😂😂😂😂
I have my tea ready
The little boy looks like the boy from that game where you have to kill the grandma
11:28 'kiss my willly' xD xD
Daz is to fucking funny😂🤣
I love daz watches
Awwww poor kid it not like she can get a nanny or something to help (sips tea cutly)
my mood throughout this video were just mad, thinking of crime, and laughing my ass off
im still not out of my biting ark
HAHAHAHAHAAHA SHE IS DRESSED LIKE A IKEA COUCH 😂😂😂😂😂 OMG
“I Can See It In Your Eyes.” Lmao Made Me Laugh For Three Years Keep It Up Champ
Did anyone see the small flying thing it might have been a moth or something

Spanking, just saying. I got the belt so should they teaches a lesson, you do bad you get spanked you know.
“This is like the council estate version of mrs doubtfire” got me laughing so much
Gizmo is so cute
Throw them, children, away!
Daz your dog right eye is red go check him up .. like for him to see
Omg I thought I was the only one to be punished by naughty step
Gggggghghhh
Omd if they were in Africa 😂😂😂
This is probably the best Daz watches ever hahaha😂🤩
❤
Where did the kid learn these words?
Daz: I got my tea. Hope u got yours  Me: goes and makes tea
The like and dislike ratio is funny
Dog looking at daz and the camera at the same time loving it ❤
React to dance moms please!!
my neighbours across from me everynight be like
Please if you want, do more. The american ones are SO wild
2:05 made me laugh way more than it should. Maybe because I'm german and I didn't expect the comment at all
I want to hug the doggo 💗💗
Only true dazzlers know this flash back about 'mum look' from another video😁🤣😎.
Super nanny needs some doom music
If you were supernanny you would be called superdaddy
Daz talking about his mom bit him to stop him from bitting others….  Me knowing that’s exactly what I did with my daughter… she bites I bite, she pulls hair I pull hers  She learned real quick!!!!
Great advice Daz. It's true. Men just have to pay child support. Looking after the children on your own is much harder. If only there a clip of super nanny turning it around
What a great way to start the video “BIRTH CONTROL”
Plllzzzzz daz we need more wholesome cute content of gizzy
Wassup king of making pple laugh 😂
Super nanny once came to our town it was strange seeing a screaming kids being films in our local Tesco
love you so much daz your so funny keep it up
pls hearing daz's childhood stories is funny af, concerning, but funny.  remember when he told the story about the drum set and the middle finger, and tredding his mother's tires hahaha
Let me be super nanny I know how to deal with rambunctious kids just take everything out of their room apart from a blanket and a pillow on the floor take away all their toys their electronics turn off all the electricity lock them in their room they'll get it in their head eventually and then when they start behaving give them one thing at a time if they misbehave again just take it away until they learn to behave
and thats why my family beat me, i dont think i was THAT aggressive though oh wait uhm yeah nah probably was. but ITS FINE they beat that shit outta me REAL FKN QUICK
YAAAAS
I’d of clapped them in their face 😭😭
Kids going super saiyan 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Be responsible and pay for an abortion.
10:01 bruh
Brah someone saw you on a his train
Ever gotten the death stare from your mom? That's when I run 🤣
I saw you at the lany concert 😂
Most of me and my mums arguments were aggressive but her naughty spot was locking me in the laundry but occasionally she’d forget ab the back door so I’d go out to the front door to my room and come back in time so she’d think I was in the laundry all along
Another day watches ahhh best feeling ever , watching daz on a brand new phone
2:30 funny
The thing is about kids being violent like this is that they definitely aren't parented properly, cause you don't just have 4yos that just decided to be violent. You can see the way the kids are dealt with isn't done properly, she just yells "oi!" Or "Don't do that", but she doesn't do it in a stern enough tone for them to listen and doesn't actually stop them. She just stands there and let's them hit her. As a mother, being combative is one of the worst things you can do in this situation, because it just causes them to argue back and it just makes them think that they're in control by getting under her nerves.  Also unless the swearing came from a bad influence at school or another relative we don't hear of, she is probably where they picked that up and she is definitely hiding certain habits on camera
I'm will slide tackle them kids
Daz you already told the middle finger story in a twich reaction vid
A new daz watches and a cute woofer. Winning 👌🖤
Omg four year old swear  that is bad.  I agree with you Daz Games
Oh ok so South Park was making fun of a real show
daz: "(we) as kids man, we... (we) don't think things  through." lol
Part 2
i’m telling u now, the naughty step and being sent to my room sorted me out 😂
A good slap would sort them out pretty quickly
Lmao some guy saw you on the train
THIS is what I have been waiting for!!
Captions be like: “and welcome back to dad’s games”
"No kid has ever gotten the better of her, she's the best nanny ever."  Me: "nanny mcfie is that you?"
Please make this a series!!
daz needs to watch dance moms
Daz probably gave better advice than jo did
My brain at 3AM: Wanna watch daz new vid????  Also me: I want Daz to have his own netflix series
Giz is SOOOO CUTTEEEEEEE😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
I was a good child I never swore or hit my parents ive never been grounded my mum always said i was a golden child and my older brother he was the total opposite of me!
Hey Daz. I really enjoy all your videos and I was wondering if I could make an edit video of you. I really idolize you.
😂
Nearly 6.9m subs😳
A d now the moment you've all been waiting for
Please react to more super nanny!!😀
same story with me about biting sister but brother
🖤🧡💚🤍♥
I ALSO HAVE A BOSTON TERRIER!
Mum: that's naughty   Me if I was supernanny: -pulls out belt
this was kinda sad ngl
I really have to thank you Daz for what you said about being a father and taking responsibility. I have a 7 year old girl and her birthfather was really abusive with me and he hasn´t seen her since she was 3 months old. It makes me so happy and so proud to hear how you view fatherhood and the comments you made about it. Thank you Daz, I appreciate you. Love from Iceland <3
Hi I love your videos your funny
the dog is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute
yesss super nanny
5:22
The amount of adds
Please make this a series
I been waiting a long time for this and I’m happy to watch this I couldn’t finish watching it when it was uploaded because I had a seizure and couldn’t stay awake after that but I’m happy I can watch it properly now
Bruh he's 4 and he is swearing
4:50 British? Why did I think this was an American show😭
Gizmo is the cutest 🥺
You should, do a super nanny spoof sketch that would be so funny.
This makes me sad I had a Chihuahua and his name was gizmo
Unfortunately I’m a 23 year old mum and baby dad is not around and he’s a narcissist and I have done everything on my own I Am a domestic abuse survivor
I know someone who’s related to super nanny
Oh, this was recent
Super nanny has failed before  If you don't believe me  Look up the Dakin family
Rip ur daughter and the doctor😆
I love your dog daz what breed is it
UGH I'M PISSEDDDD
He looks so much like iggy from jojo
When you said " a silent angry mom" it made me think of my mom. If we were in trouble she would point at her eyebrows.
I'm just going to leave it here, IF THESE KIDS HAD AN ARAB PARENTS THEY WILL KNOW HOW SPOILD THEY ARE.
0:34 what about your daughter?
Thank you daz I’m sick right now and your videos make me laugh so hard then I cough but it makes it all worth it
My old dog was called gizmo
"That's how i get mums attention.. Take her jaw" HAHAHAAHAH omg
That is the mom death stair
What a cute pupper
my mum used to sit on me lmao and I barely ever threw tantrums
How am i not even subcribed?! Daz I've watched you since vine WTAF. I've only just bloody realised!
it’s like nanny mcphee at the start
So happy and proud for you. Your view have completely Rocked up!  I used to watch this growing up FFS ahahaha
Ok so my brother does this to me (hes like 4 or 5) but most boys do this if a father figure isnt around because they feel as if they are man of the house so they think they can do what ever they want and thats why he probably acts this way
This is hilarious! I have been watching ur old ark vids and there so funny! R u ever gonna do them again?? 🤩🤩
If I had to do that my dad would back flip kick me
I love you daz!! You brighten my day soo much and always love when i get a notification about a new video you are amazing at what you do and never stop doing what you love ❤❤❤ YOU INSPIRE ME!
Puppy :)
Eric Cartman looks so mild compared to deez kids.
Is it true that you were on a train this week and that someone on Tiktok was recording you Daz???
I would walk past them and seeing the kids doing that shit and I will just slap the shit out of them so they get happy and cry full of excitement
been waiting for this my whole life oml😭😭😭
It's too late for people like Daz and I. Don't let kids happen to you too lol
I very rarely pity the parents in these things. You're 100% responsible for your kids' behavioral problems. Everyone wants children but they're not capable of taking care of them.
My mother was such a stern old bat, that she never had to full on discipline me as a child,  because I was conditioned to not even think about it.
Kids are crazy. I was an Au Pair for a while and "my" little girl (bless her she's adorable) on some days just went nuts, screaming and beating me, especially when it came to piano practise or taking a shower. Every time her dad came home while I was in trouble with her, he just went "Aww what's wrong?" and blamed whatever was wrong on me. "She went crazy because she couldn't have xy" "Oh but she can have xy, you could've given it to her!" ...not the point, dad! That just made everything so much worse.
Pls play sea of thieves and home sweet home survive
my little brother is like that
Daz posting: Cures my bad mood😌
Gizmo
Why does Gizmo look so much like Daz😂😂
Gizmo is so adorable! 🥰
SUPERR DAZZ!
Ayyyye Daz! Look at you on trendinggggg!✨✨
Your not lonley you have us we are your family
🔫 I need Gizmo immediately.
FINALYYYYYY!!!
one of the funniest daz watches ever
Daz should make a video about making a  daz watches
I'm either the greatest mom or the luckiest. My children never acted this way. Not even as toddlers. I've never once been hit, kicked or bit by my kids. My son( oldest) never had tantrums. My daughter ( youngest) only yells and stomps her feet. 90% of the times it's because she is or about to be sick with a cold. I just don't understand how kids can act like that. I sit and hug my kids when they are upset and we talk it out. I validate their feelings and we find ways together to figure out where the frustration is coming from. I'm also the silent stare at them mom now that they are older. Even take a step closer to them without and they instantly apologize . I don't yell at my kids. No one needs to tell at kids for them to behave.
I JUST FINISHED WATCHING THE RING IT WAS AMAZING, but i found it more sad than horror like i was curious about her backstory and when i started to peace it together i felt really sad(this was mu first horror movie ever and i love all dazs horror game vids so i was so eager to tell the dazlers)
great video daz
Gizmo just using you for clout and money!!!!😠
Omg when mums give you that look where their whole face changes and they drop whatever they are doing...you know you're in deep shit. You can feel your soul drop to your knees in an instant.
If there is one thing i love about daz’s videos he always adds a positive message <3333
13:42 this is why I watch his videos, I have so much respect for Daz
Yes been waiting for Gizmo to take over 😂
but what about the hub and the pies if you know you know
Drop kick it
"Oh there all lined up like little nazis" im pms 🤣🤣🤣
the German super nanny once killed dog
Ok but I didn't expect him to just shout "BIRTH CONTROL" it made me laugh sooo much
Dear good
Haha omg your dog is amazing 🤩 so cute 🥰
I wish Daz made 1 hour long Daz Watches videos lol
So its normal that kids can be aggressive huh?  Guess i aint normal then😂 I always was said to be mentally older than i am physically, so that might be why🤔😳
9:57 I would be lying if I said I wasn't thinking exactly the same thing 😂
if this mans can pull a girl all us can
Now that I’ve love to see! Super nanny daz
Please react to dance moms
Pro tip to those who have kids like this. I have a son aged 3 with terrible twos his bed is his time out with no toys. It works if you keep putting them back in their room with no toys they'd calm down
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Let me tell you this is another reason of why i dont want kids. If i had kids and they acted like this it would be a day.
THIS IS ME 🤣🤣🤣
Omg! I have a Boston named Gizmo too!!!
you should play superliminal
My solution is only 'do it' when you are married (for security) and then have kids because you planned it. My other plan (easiest) don't date especially these days, it's not worth it and just cost more money than what you're making.
Part 2??? 🥺😍
My parents used to have the ‘naughty corner’ which was the bathroom. I got put there a lot so I made the best of it and put the mat on the toilet as a comfy chair, filled a decorative seashell with hot water and had a tea party.
Omg no way I named my cat gizmo that fucking AMAZING! Good choice lol
When you can tell the kids haven't been disappointed or know what's right or wrong
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥰
part 2 ?
I'd love to see Daz react to Supernanny working with the Chapman family, or atleast some highlights of it.
Who names there kid shanon
How is it every time I watch daz he just makes my day by laughing
See now I didn't even watch the TV show The Nanny when was younger. I'm 39 now when I was 26 I had my tubes tied so I really don't have to worry about having kids.
At 1:40 she reminds me of marry poppins 😂😂💀
Cute dog
when i was little my mom would watch this and she scared the sh*t out of me and when i misbehaved she said ill call super nanny  i stopped
Bro, I remember my Super Nanny phase-   It was scary.....
Lock him in the room
Yo my dog is called gizmo aswell
Bird or a jammed finger
I love Gizmo, he is so cute!
Lol they grow up so fast 😂
Daz we also got clean shoe rewards
If i did this i wouldn't be able to sit down for a year
If I even thought about hitting my parents like that I'd be in an orphanage. :(
Don't mean this as a criticism of daz's phasing at all but his message about responsibility also applies to women as well. Both parties have responsibility for a child. They need you both
9:18 my mom never does that to me
daz u should do a vlog of you going to "london dungeons" its a really fun kinda horror experience
This is why you don't get shows like this in South Africa. You punch your mum, she whoops your ass with a flip flop/slipper
Hope your doing well dazz
Oh the memories how my mom would hit me for behaving badly. So many nice memories 🥲
Gizmo :D    Daz educating men bout pregnancy is the best part of his career
That boy is godzila
Do a whole episode pleaseee weee neeed iiit!!!!
If I was the father and I was there I would wwe slam them through the f#@%ing table😎(edited= reason I would lose my shit
Do u still live in hastings
dog is better than girlfriend/boyfriend
Does she not own a belt 🤔
Your not alone daz cause you have all of us🙌🏼🙌🏼
They should start a new show called “Super Daz”
Daz does the best reaction vids ever 😂
My dog's name is Gizmo😱
This made me laugh so much lmao I’d love it if you reacted to more of this Daz :)
do i want kids?
Gizmo (I think that’s how you spell it) looks so big now I remember seeing him when he was almost the size of daz hand
Kids going super saiyain 🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣
You should react to the worlds cheapest million air also your dog is beautiful
Hold on so you tell me my son hitting our dog and fight us his siblings  is fridgeing normal!🤯 . Ihis dad and I are losing our mind  here .
I can’t hear gizmo without wanting to crawl into a hole and cry
He's so cute 😍😍😍 and daz don't worry we love you and gizmo just the same ❤️❤️
Oh i'm terrible -  had an ad for IVF before the video started and then Daz started speaking about kids being the best form of contraception 😂
since when did daz have a dog ?
Part 2?
I can’t see any comments about Gizmo, give us gizmo content, gizmo watches
The look ur mum gives you is so scary like you know you've fucked up
My brother who’s 5 is exactly the same as that kid, I’ve nearly broken my wrist, my brother once sent a kid to the hospital, he can’t control himself
Unfortunately when one sibling gets more attention than the rest, it creates hate for the other sibling and the parents. I had it with my dad and my half brother. Dad payed more attention to my half brother and let him  get away with everything because his mum ran out on him. I hated my dad and my brother for years. But I got over it and I speak to my dad now but really distant with my brother, he still gets away with treating people like crap and he’s 14 now
Yall daz is 39 on trending
I love how you didn’t even watch Jo in action.
“There’s nothing here to keep me on this step” tehe when i was really little my mom would lock me into my push chair 😃🤚
How is everyone
“MY GOD, THESE KIDS ARE SATAN!!”  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This award goes to Daz Black for having the shiniest shoes
My husband is the shouter and I'm the stoic stern one. My husband cannot understand why our child listens to me more than him. I tried explaining that if you show zero emotion while sternly saying what you want them to do or not do they have no idea what you're about to do and the threat of punishment in their head is worse than an actual reaction.
BLOODY JESUS🤣
OMG I LOVE SUPER NANNY! I NO JOKE WATCHED AN EPISODE OF IT YESTERDAY!❤️
If miss trunchbull and Nanny McPhee had a child- it would be joe you can’t change my mind
I love super nanny! so happy you reacted to her!!
"she's like spiderman but was bitten by another mum" I'm reelinggg 🤣🤣
Super nanny part 2?
I've never been happier to be sterile (by choice. Had my tubes out last year. Best decision ever) Kids and people in general act this way because there's no punishment. If you could punch a bitch and put them in their place, people would act right real quick. But nowadays there's no consequences to people's actions so they pull this shit
YES FINNALY ANOTHER ONE
Spidermum bitten by a karen
So i was scrolling though youtube and i stumbled onto this youtube video( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVnToRrManQ ) It seems quite interesting. I saw your reaction on the video "All men are thrash" :) and thought you might want to react to this too
YOUR DOG IS SO CUTE
daz is living the dream
My mum used to sit me on the stairs and if I played up on the stairs she would move me further and further up until once I was moved so far up that she just said go to your room. From then on if I played up I was put in the corner, to which once I fell asleep against the wall for around 20 minutes
I used to bite people, decided to bite my mom one day and I was about five. She stopped on the side of the road and bit me back, I never bit anyone again. If your kid is a biter, bite them back
We need more of these absolutely love them! ❤️
the first frame is exaclly what I was looking for in this video
Goodness my Palestinian mom would have kicked me to Mars.
It's infuriating to watch a parent who has failed so much...
I feel like most children have that age range where if they dont get what they want they turn violent
Daz:” why is everyone whereing BLUE! Me:”THANK YOU FOR THE BLUE!!
“They’ve got their kids all lined up, like little nazis” - Daz Black
“Look at Joe just standing there in the corner… it’s like a curtain” 😂 i cried at that part
Do more supernanny pls it’s hilarious
daz i have been only drinking tea for the past week. im getting a fraction of dazes strenght
I threw my 3 out of Asda the other day as they were bickering, made them go and wait for me by the car while I finished. My eldest is 15 and towers over me I am not a mum to be messed with 😂 It’s rare for me to shout at them but when I give them “the look” they know they’re in trouble 😂 I feel so much for this mum but Daz is the funniest!
Daz:” I know you want to camera gizmo” Gizmo:” I NEED MORE that’s why I look sad
that kid is going to be a hitman with that aim
Your dog looks like the dog version of my cat 😔 with the same red collar and everything.
Hahaha the mum look works every time my 3 know they fucked up and pushed it too far if they get the look.
Your dog has the same name as my dog. :)
😂
If I ever did that in my youth, or even now. I would get bopped, wopped and dropped into next year. Also the dirty room with the pigsty analogy is universal.
My parents never did the naughty spot with me. They'll just say no pc for a month and I would be an angel lol
Daz: I got my tea, I hope you have yours Me: uhhhh well I got SOUP!😂
banger
Hey daz I have a question for u, can people in Australia buy your merch or does it just not go that far i just really want some and don't know. If you can pls get back to me that would be great thanks.
Great advice btw x
Early
Daz, you are amazing. Thank you for always setting a good example where you can. You have changed my view in one of your videos on 'being true to yourself and not comparing yourself to others' and I'm sure you will continue to have a good impact on peoples lives.  Also, please do a part 2 and keep doing super nanny videos, they are hilarious!
Gizmo is so cuuuutttteee❤️❤️
You should react to Pete the meat puppet music video daz!
thank you daz...i was crying before i watched this because my dad walked off before i was born...he didn't want me and used the excuse as: Shes not my daughter. (Im non binary now use any pronouns) but god bless you and again thank you. some dads can just suck it up. you'll end up loving them either way
People make you lonely, animals never!!!
I woulda get smacked right thru the face if I was doing stuff like that when I was younger😂😂
will there be a part 2?
I got the “magic man” certificate as I was good at nothing but was also the only person who did magic in the whole school. That hurt a little
Jo gives off “good.... but sinister....” vibes and I can’t Unsee it
when u did the stern face it gave me flashbacks
just whoop they ass the fuck, it worked with me lmao
my sister bit me as well, my mom came in and bit her on the hand, then my sister bit her back. Lets just say we were all crying
If I was that kid, well thankfully I never was.
OMFG 😍 the dog, so gorgeous I love it x 🌷 Great video you dazzler you!
Apparently Daz waters his dog
1:29 did he say "go on ad kiss my willy!" ???
Can you react to Bart Baker?
Please do more supernanny vids
So what happend did the nanny fix the kids? Part 2😱‼️
Love this man❤️
Yeessss these are so funny I used to watch them if I acted like these entitled kids I’d get the shit beaten out of me
This is a video we needed but we didn’t know we needed
I'd beat their asses if they start behaving like that to me  My father always gave me a slap on a hand or really make sure that whatever I was doing was wrong  And it worked for me. Some kids just needs a bit of sense kicked into them, but then there's the fear that people would see the parents as child abusers...
1:42 Did anybody else think it was their cat the meowed?
I think the scariest thing about my mom when she's mad is when she's acting calm because you expect her to yell at you but she's like "ok I understand but this is what we're gonna do" and then she'll like say something or she'll just she'll just start yelling out of nowhere that is the scariest thing about my mother
My mom just dropped me straight on my butt. Never bit anyone again
part 2?
Play station gone for 2 weeks more like half a Year for me😂
Bless this woman, she has much more patience than I do. Holy shit
PLEASE DO MORE OF THESE
When did daz get a dog?
WE NEED MORE OF THESE DAZ 😂
she looks like miss trunchbull from the movie matilda
Council’s version of Mrs Doubtfire! 😂😂
one of the funniest daz watches ever
Daz I think you would like to play At Dead Of Night it is a really great horror game. I love your YouTube videos & channel
The energy bill joke had me gone😂😂😂
i would not have this behavour like its uneceble i know i spelled it wrong but still get a spatchula and fucking slap them
This is my favourite day vid bcz we get to hear Dazs embarrassing life stories
first of all Daz I do not understand why you single I mean look at you❤️
BRO I'VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG 😁
ok but i died when he called joe a curtain 💀
I'm legal guardian for my niece's. I've been worrying something is wrong with my 8 year old. You saying the doctor told you it's normal and kids are just spiteful at that age has filled me with so much relief and reassurance!  🥳🤗
Gizmo's cute
omw those kids would have never been able to sit on a chair ever again.
DAZZZZZ WATCH DANCE MOMS!!!!!
pt2
She’s got them all lined up like little nazi’s 🙂😂🤣
“She’s like Spider-Man but she was bitten by another mum” 😂😂😂😂
I have a dog named Gizmo aswell! 🥰 He is a border collie
The kids went from 0-100 😂😂
Best video you’ve ever done.
Me if I was Super Nanny: "Smack the fuck out of them" *End of episode* 😂
daz would honestly leave the kid on the road and when he’s telling people the story he wouldn’t feel guilty or sad he would actually be exited and happy to explain
Super Nanny is the ultimate birth control
i’ve seen kids act like that in public but they just got swot and they were fine until they left
They should just try my mom and dads approach.... If I even thought of behaving like that, I would have been cripple. I swear... Beating, I tantrum... beating.... And here I am thinking all this time, that mum should just put the kid over her knee and slap him. Personally I would drop kick him
My daddy would've just stabbed me and sent me to my room.       (っ˘̩╭╮˘̩)っ (comment if u know who I am )
I hope this isn't weird or too straight forward, but I'd do whatever Gizmo would want from me.
If i acted like like that when i was young i would get a holiday of beatings... 👀
DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Never new you had a dog daz lol. I have watched you for a year and haven't known this.
Gizmo is adorable 🥺🥺🥺
CUTE DOG CUTE DOG CUTE DOG AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
If my kids everrrrr act like them kids they’re getting the belt
if i did that to my mom i would say "hi kobe"
3:47 😂😭😂😂
“IKEA couch” 😂💀
8:22 lol I did that when my family was walking on the streets of melbourne Australia and I didn’t apologise until we got back to our apartment I WAS A ANGRY 4 YEAR OLD
I bit my mum when I was a kid. She bit me back. Never bitten anyone since lol
Bro I did that EXACT same thing and the EXACT thing happened and I immediately speed walked to my room to clean it🥲
DOG!! I LOVE DOGS
MY DOG ERNIE LOOKS SO CLOSE TO YOUR DOG GIZMO
These kids dad left the milk
I died when he said "And she's dressed like an Ikea couch" I even choked on my pizza lmfao😂😂
As someone who grew up with a single parent, Daz is absolutely right. When a man walks out of his kid's life, it leaves a mark that cannot be erased...
Part two of the rest pls!!!
“She’s got them all lined up, just like little Nazis.” I couldn’t stop laughing my throat hurts now.
daz is probably the funniest youtuber ever
In South Africa you don't dare to be disrespectful to your parents. Especially you're mom🤣 she'll swipe you off of the face of the earth with a flip flop
Daz should watch super nanny bacon is good for me.
Omg ive been waiting for this 😂😂
That dog is way better than my dog pls gimme
Kid’s like taking a small feisty dog everywhere
Gizmo (or Gismo) are so cute. <3 <3 <3
Gizmo is so cute I am a big fan 😆
My name is Rhys/Reece
My mom is Mexican and she would of beat me if I acted like one of those kids tbh I don’t even think I’ll be in this earth if I acted like that towards my mom lol
What type of dog is he
My mom will kill them
i bit my best mate in the face and my mum bit me back
I'm watching this thinking what if that was me treating my mum that way while at the same time feeling my grandads hand hovering around the back of my head
child day is thanking Jesus cause he can feel Jesus In this chillis tonight
Why in the heck is gizmo not on this more
On the bright side there are kids that behave goodly
OML!! I HAVE TWO BOSTON TERRIERS!! UR DOG IS SO CUTE IM CRYING RN-
i knew what supernanny was before i clicked onto the video and i dropped dead when Daz said 0:41
I bit my mom one time when I was 4 or 5 and she backhanded the shit outta me so bad that a couple days later I lost my first tooth I will never forget that shit...              guess the jokes on her tho cuz now I'm the one with a full set of teeth and she's all gums lol nah jk I love my mom
watered you lol
YESSS and ur dog is so ADORABLE.
Daz should react to the cheapskate who cooks her lasagna in the dishwasher
Hey daz do you think you could react to totally studios next?
*"Oh my god he's adorable, but I bet he's the worst one."* I've seen many kids considered 'adorable' I can 100% conclude they are usually indeed the worst, it doesn't matter from where- they usually are the worst.
I Was thinking about what would happen if he reacted to this like 2 days ago!!!!!!!!!!!!
Near deth experiences with Daz 7:98
4:09 that reaction from Daz is the best clip I will ever see
"Bite him" my gosh Daz! 🤣
Nothing wrong with being a single man with a dog 🥰
Am I the only one who is almost 100% positive the mom is probably just as violent to them when the nanny isn’t there
The dad was lucifer
Hey dad I have a pug called gizmo lol
Long have i waited, for daz to do another daz watches!
good to see you again daz!
this was filmed near me
"A baby can always happen" *laughs in gay*
Every time daz uploads it makes us all feel better
Could have used a better episode
I had to watch three adds for this video so I tapped off and then I clicked of clicked on it again and it had no vids!
if i spoke to my mum that way i would be the new man on the moon
4:26 😂
Uuuuh that fake tan Nanny is sporting 😂😂😂😂😂
I used to have a dog that I rescued and he suffered from alot of medical problems named gizmo but he preferred to be called goofy goober I miss him every day and seeing you talk to your dog reminded me of how I used to come home from school and tell my dog about my day.
This video reminded me about my one friend, she got pregnant and the father of the child didn't want the baby so he left her, a month later she has a new boy friend and when she told him I am pregnant with another man's child, he still stayed by her side and they are still together she gave birth a few days ago but sadly she gave the baby up for adoption because she had to carry on with school
Very cute dog.
I agree with dad on this I think that if you get a woman pregnant even by accident you need to take responsibility for your actions
And this is why you just send these demons off to an island and let them do the rest.
If I behaved like that little boy my asian mom would've banned me from eating rice for a week (I love rice) she would've made me have school 3 hours more than the others and she would've threatened me with her goddamn flip flop.   Oh wait, I did behave like that boy once
Daz if you meet a Africa mother if i swore at my mother she beat me with a wooden spoon
Daz seems like such an amazing parent! GET THIS MAN AN AWARD!!!
“Pull my hair back and put me in blue” that sounds like a quote
YOUR DOG LOOKS LIKE MINE WTH except mines grey and white
I’m not a parent, but I have pretty much raised my sister who is 10 years younger than me sense I was 11. She is the most energetic kid ever and mom ALWAYS gives her her way. She is getting testing done for ADHD soon and hopefully they do something about it.
If my kids did that to me or my wife ,especially that slap. Well kid would be asleep for a bit till they wake up on the better side of the bed. I was raised and born in 90s discipline is necessary just not too much
Had I yell or hit or swear at my mom😂I would have got slapped clean across the room, these kids need that and I guarantee they would stop that bs
Boston baby 😍 awwww
Some of us here in America say, "this is why you need to beat your kids. " Well instead of beat, we now say "kill your kids." lol. We're basically staying discipline your kids, not actual beatings as in abusing
I reckon daz would look good in blue
bro istg when i was born in the 2000's i got grounded from being inside

me and my siblings had a corner that we had to stare into.
Part 2222
funniest streamer rage compilation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bHWJf48PvA&ab_channel=Kurowolf
If I talked like that to my parents I’d be 20 ft deep underground chilling with the dinosaurs 😂
Much love daz. Your content is as dazzling as always💖
She looks like a private school principle that you thought lived in the "basement" of the school. That's why your ruff stands up. Yeah. She's Marry Poppins. Not. AAAND that's why I tied my tubes. I can always count on this man to laugh
Dam should react to world’s strictest parents Australia
I also bit my sister and my mum said My sister could bite me
Bring those kids to my Arab family they won’t say a single word for the rest of their lives…😂
daz i love you but when you talked to the camera all i could focus on was that saliva that kept moving while you spoke 😭
This was my dream daz reaction...
I always watch super nanny lol
I got an award from school for best hide and seek hahah
If my kid or anyone eles bites my leg i will drop kick them  And sorry daz theres already a supper manny
time to bring out the good ole wooden spoon
I LOVE THE INTRO PLEASE-😭😭😭  Edit: once in school in 3rd grade I got an award for always smiling and I’m laughing way too hard
Not seeing any dad cause the kids fucking ATE HIM
The fact that me and Daz both named our dogs Gizmo just made my day, week, year and life. 🥳 One time for the Gizzie's! 🐶💖
This can’t be a real family no way cuz literally it said she needs to observe their behaviour and got to the main climax straight away
And this… is where Eshays come from
Aye daz on no.33 trending
The face he makes at 10:00 is just 10/10🤌🤣
I haven’t had my PlayStation for 6 months
can you watch some episodes about the grand tour/old top gear
Your best friend getting pregnant, right before you watched this video there was a birth control ad, then Dax talks about birth control. I get it okay😂
Can we get one more Daz watches like this?🥺😂 I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so damn hard in my life towards this show😂😂
i think it works the same in my country as well. some of these government workers have more than 5 kids to avoid tax? or things like that. just getting 5~6 kids for their benefit but at the same time add more struggle in life... i dont get that
Starting off with a puppy? Already liked this video within the first 3 seconds
your ugly dog looks like my ugly dog, both Boston terriers <3
1:46 ok let's just not forget that episode of South park
I’ve binged every single one of ur videos at least 3 times now, some 5 or more, Goodness Daz, ur amazing and I wish u a long happy life
I was sitting here crying because I found out my friends haven’t been inviting me to things and idk what I did and I come across Daz and it brings a smile on my face knowing I do have him to come and watch when I’m having a rough day❤️
Hey I got a question for you how are you single and have a kid
When I was a toddler I bit my mom and she bit me back. I never bit anyone again.
Did the father run off or did they get divorced?
This is one of the reasons I’m gay
nono we just dont want kids. I wrote a whole speech just talking about how toddlers are horrible
"Like little nazi's" I was dying when he said that XD
oh I've been waiting for this one
you should react ot all of the walten filessss:DDD
I was such a bad kid I was violent and mean I made my teachers cry and hit pushed and scratched the other students my mom was apparently called to the office alot when I was younger for my violent behavior I don't think I ever hit the teachers but I could have I suppose and I did make them cry I remember this one teacher she was always crying I didn't feel bad because I didn't think it was my fault I guess it was the way I looked at her or glared at her that's only one of the reasons my siblings called me a demon child
If you like this one you should check out the super nanny us episodes some content gold there!
the nanny just has a judgmental way about her that's off putting
Ahhh..if I was there, they would be crying from an ass whooping. All fails, ill call child services and they can take them...for the kids own safety. Next time they be black and blue. But the question is...where is the dad and why does a super nanny need to come in?
My child would get nothing if they acted like that. Hell no
That’s such a cute dig I love the intro!😣😣✨✨✨🫖🫖🫖🫖❤️
We need more gizmo time!!!😅🥰🥰
“i bit my sister. not- not when i was twenty.. i’m not *mental.* but when i was a *kid* — i bit her.”
The mom look....it's powerful
Is super nanny still a thing? I mean, last time I saw it was a long time ago, so I can't help but wonder if it's still going.
Dogs are better than most of the people anyway
What happen to your girlfriend?
My 3 year old bother was listening to my nan say bull shit and all he does now is walk around saying it 😳 its quite funmy tho but when my mum see's me laugh she says im next that scares me🤚😭
Agree everything with you daz.
This is why we beat kids 😂
what you have a dog i never knew!
Bro I got the Ultimate jeff award bc it was the day day of grade 7 and she said ur seth right, I said no ik Jeff, and she just went on like a hunt to find my name and it took her two weeks to figure it out
I would have been in prison for three 1st degree murder charges. Because I would have drop kicked Satan out of them.
If l slapped my mother in 1 second l would be dead
His eyebrows are on fleek 😗
Same daz my school also gave me award for perseverance for talking to my teacher about it and the also gave me a ten dollar gift card for coffee
i have  mac n chz not tea lol
Daz do you remember Ruby Rube well she made a video on you as in she responded to your video please make video on this
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Yeah this was my show when i was 5 it fairly recently just returned to US programming because it was an England exclusive show for a while and in 2020 supernanny would come back to the States
Solution to stopping the children is to pay more attention to the older child and do your best to not lash out at the younger child until being loud is not working and they just give up
One thing that is more scary than a mum is being threatened to get kicked in the nuts by your dad but luckily it never happened to me
they would get a ass whooping an wouldn't be sit down for a week straight
Once I got a award for smiling more than the others,the most gorgeous smile.
its been a second since i’ve watched you- but you have no idea how much ur intro made me smile :)
If I said to my mum I want nothing she would be like fine don’t eat but there is no food later
“Omg some kids gonna get drop kicked across the living room” 😭😭😭
we need more giz the dog
This is why I can never have kids…I would pop the shit out of them. I just don’t have the patience.
Iggyyyyyyyyyyy
Daz video💓. Daz with a puppy in video 💗💓💕
i dont care what people think i was raised in the country and if my kids do that im sorry daz i would punch him in th emouth but i swear he would not do it no more
If I did anything that those kids do I’d be with Jesus already.
I watched this when I lived in Georgia USA for comfort
hey daz my therapist asked if I have anything that makes me feel better and I can always rely on to make me laugh, I said you. <3 thank you
Almost to 7 mil
Daz: “they’re beating the shit out of everyone” My Family: 😳🔪  🔫👀                           🪓 🤯                         😃⚔️😀
Doors are on life support
Gag the child 👍
Me and you have the same birthday august 7th
i got an award for being dramatic 😂😂
Can we please get a part 2 🥺🥺🥺
Is it me or who else wants to steal his dog and spoil the hell out of it 😍
daz just run for fucking president
Honestly I don’t think a man should have to be there for the child. A woman can choose to have or not to have the child. A man should be able to choose to be or not to be part of that child’s life.
Part 2 of the nanny fixing things?
If I ever got my mom like that at that age my dad would beat the shit out of me and I be scared as hell
mannnn if i ever tried to hit my parents i would of got the left hook to the head and would of woke up 3 days later haha smack em back bet they will stop
You should watch the short film Alma or some progressive commercials
I just feel like it comes down to if you're ready for the responsibility of raising a child. If you can discipline your child without hitting them or you reward them with good behavior, don't spoil them I feel like they'd be a good kid. When I was little my mother scared me to death. A little harsh she was. If I ever have kids I don't want to be the same way my mother was
Please do more of these videos with the nanny!!
omg these kids ARE satan. hahshodkfbf
My kid: *stands on the table screaming * Me: *swings my hand and knocks him into the wall*
Can you react to more
the main reason I don't even have sex is that I'm terrified of getting pregnant!! makes me sick to my stomach, I really don't want kids, and yes I know there a ways to prevent this, but as Daz said there is always a chance.
She’s literally the principal from Matilda.
With those episodes you have to go at least half way through and Joe starts the process, since she’s observing the first day.
I LOVE supernanny!
I watched this since I was young and was like ohhh these kids
Omg is i was the mom as soon as the nanny left the kids would be slapped to Africa then an African mom can adopt them then the kids life is officially over
One of my friends is 15 and she’s pregnant and the father is being an absolute piece of shit
I love daz games
I love your little dog
0:21 that's adorable !!!!!!
Daz:I can see it in your eyes Giz:I can see enemy's coming from any direction
Daz:"I've got my tea" *picks up and shows mug* "I hope you have as well" Me:👁👄👁*stares at screen* "...but I don't like tea"
Aw loved the message at the end
Oh man, I remember that look of death from my folks...just got chills up my spine for a second
Daz: I’ve got dazzlers to talk to 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 I feel loved
I love super nanny can’t wait to watch
Now watch the south park version
"She'll see first hand the child's explosive temper." No, that's just called being 4 years old.
My life was simple if i missed behaved i was slapped. I learnt very quick 😂
If they were my kids they wouldn’t have a head
Lol^_^
Mrs.doubtfire what the best
I don’t know why people still think this show is about bad children, it’s about bad parents, the ONLY thing Jo does is fix the parenting.
Omg I remember the first time Daz shown Gizmo to us, he was so tiny, look at him now 🥺 Adorable 💕
my mum gives me the silent treatment all the time :’)
GIZZ IS SO CUTE 😭👌
The I haven't watched super nanny in a very ling time haha, ah the good old memories.
me eating cookies: 🥰 Daz: “birth control” me: oh shit drop everything I forgot to take mine 😂😂😂
5:30 Funny story, reminds me of when I was 3, I loved to bite the fuck out of people. It didn't matter who you were, my mom, auntie, cousin.  I bit everyone, to the point where they were too scared to carry me anymore🤣🤣.  Until one day, my dad was carrying me, and I bit his shoulder a little too hard. So he decided... to clamp his withered, crocodile teeth on to my arm, SO FUCKING HARD, I cried😭🤣, I was so fucking terrified, and it hurt like hell🥲.   From that day on I never bit anyone. I was so traumatized... I even have flashbacks whener he bare his teeth at me🥲😭
Beat your kids
Week....👊👊bang*bang*......POV Karen:- You need to leave me:bang*
My cat is named Gizmo lol  An I still want to know how he did that thing with his hat on vine
You should whach fadoras are awesome by Adam the alien it's not copyright it's super cring
bRO you are like the first human I can find funny🤣🤣
hi
I like to watch this show when I feel bad about the fact that I can’t get pregnant, makes me feel a bit better about the fact I can sleep till 12pm and not have to deal with screaming demon children. 😂
Is it just me or I remember daz telling the story of him flipping his mum off before 😭😭😭
All you have to do is beat the shit out of them lol 😂
You should watch “Wife Swap” - I feel like you’d get a kick out of most of those episodes 😆
Yes, That mom needs 1 Thing, A DAZ 😂😂👌
11:28 what did he sayyyyyyyy
You think you're lonely?? I have four cats... Try me...I will loneliness you into oblivion!!
Again daz thank you I needed this
And I rest easy in my decision to be sterilized 🙌 Kids aren’t where it’s at.
There is always a chance of pregnancy n if ur boyfriend isn't ready for it don't do it..a child changes everything..
All in favour for daz to make a super nanny sketch
Your mum put your shiniest shoes certificate on the fridge for herself for sure
I dont care if he's 4, if my kid wants to throw down I'LL THROW DOWN
not gonna lie, the second he said "got my tea, you should to" i said HOLD ON... stopped the video, made myself tea and sat down and pressed play
I watched a comedian Tim Hawkins who had Super Nanny jokes. How she never loses her cool "We don't do that, Thomas. What do I mean? You just knocked your mother out cold with a pot." About her "naughty mat" they go sit on for timeouts. He said he'll be the Super Nanny, tune in. "We don't do that, Thomas. Come on, let's go. I'm gonna drive you off a naughty cliff. No, you don't need your shoes, you're not coming back. Say bye to your brother and sister, lets go meet Jesus!"
lmao the middle finger part had dead lmaooooo.
Daz would that be IKEA Blue or green Blue
In my day I would have soap in my mouth and a back porch painted red...
Literally making a tea while Daz said "got my tea, hope you have too"
That’s ironic my dogs name is gizmo 😂
Daz why do you always make me laugh,your laugh is very contagious.also I love your dog
I watch supernanny myself and was wonder when I'd see daz react to her
yasss ive been waiting for thisss
My Asian mum would drop kick me down if I act like that
I need more Gizmo content please!
I would have been beaten... i would have been beaten and put into the foster care system. That is what would happen to me if i acted like that against  my mom.
Look I grew up in a very different country Little kid throws a punch at an adult? Gets slapped into next week
the dog awe :)
Daz I have a Boston terrier to and I think their the best kind of dog.
Puppy! 🥰🥰🥰
My mom gave that same look except in addition to the look she also crinkled her lips together to look even more angry, I was terrified of that face as a kid
Daz: yeah, that's right. I'm a single man with a dog.   Me: that's okay. I'm a single girl with a cat. 🤣🤣🤣
she just needed to slap the living hell out of him ONCE just ONCE and it'd all be over
"...and Joe Frost is dressed like an Ikea couch." I'M PISSING MYSELF BAHABAHBAHAB
there isnt a thought behind those eyes
More content with Gizmo!! he's so cute :)
L PARENT
Yup don't think I want kids
OMG THE DOG IS SO FRICKIN CUTEEEE
The amount of compassion he's showing for the mom. Warms the heart. So understanding.
THE LOOK SO TRUE ! I swear I shit my pants every tim !
Yes DAZ! You always spitting FACTS!!!! 100% Thank YOU! <3 much love!
idc what anyone says but spankings are the number one resolve for misbehaving kids. all my childhood i had a fear/respect for my parents and rarely acted out. all because of spankings
If I ever did this my mom would knock me into a new family
Daz you’ve gotta play dark deception!!
I thought U called the doggo Jizz instead of Giz for a second- 😀✋
wait? Then who done ur hair, in that video one time if ur a lonely man?? n why u keep yelling out Linda! xD as a joke,
"Ahhh yes i have my tea"Evry eglish person.
YYAAAAASSS I have been requesting you to watch this it finally happens
I wish I heard this advice in high school. I never got anyone pregnant, but I definitely would have looked at things a bit different and made some different choices.
my sadness when hearing you call him gizmo not teacup :(( jk gizmos cuteeee
Jo Frost is an absolute queen 👑
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sN7kgEw954  a spoilt rich girls dad tells her if she doesn't make money or have a job he wont pay her anymore, to prove that she can she sings this... terribly 😂😬
You seem like an incredible father. Your daughter is fortunate to have you 😊
I want a 10 min video of Gizmo just staring at the camera
i dont think its normal tbh that kids act like this. I mean like yeah when theyre like 2 or 3 but if you teach them discipline and dont let them take over you, they could be angels. My sister taught her kids discipline and they always treat her respectfully
the moment my younger siblings hit me i just grab their wrist and hold the there behind their back and wait till they beg to be let go dont wanna hit me after that now do yah ye lil shits
I love your dog so cute 🥰 he’s so little ☺️
I love this channel
I'd love to see a Hispanic nanny, prob would whoop all the bad kids Into place 😭😭😭
He’s FINALLY DONE IT
Omg this is the best day of my life!!!
Mom- what do you want. Kid - NOTHING!!! Daz- "Alright and that's what you'll get! you'll also get my BOOT!!! 🥾
I would have been hit with a belt
comdoms
Daz, please watch dance moms!
did you guys ever notice how daz is at almost 7 mil and also leave a comment under if you been watching for 4 years
“All lined up, like little nazis”. 🤣💀
Now that I've seen him react to Super Nanny, I'd love to see a reaction to wife swap!
DOGGO
I have two Boston terriers one is 11 years old......she still thinks she's a baby and tries being the cool grandma the other is afraid of its own shadow and as become bald  so my sister calls him Mr world wide
And people wonder why I hate the thought of having children.  A million reasons, and this is just one of them.
I use to watch her 24 7 😄
you have a awesome point of view
Can we get an entire Daz Watches with Gizmo, please?🥰
Yeah I'd lose my patience with those kids..
Your 49 on trending
We need a SuperNanny skit with Huw!😂
No one wants to hear this, but a lot of it is just parenting flaw. Like yes, kids will do a bad thing cuz they don’t know better. But it’s ur job as the parent to reinforce good behavior for the future. Usually if a kid is displaying bad behavior over and over and over again, it’s cuz the parent hasn’t established good healthy  boundaries / communication. I know it can be more complicated than that, but understanding your child and showing them respect is important. Children don’t have adult cognitive skills formed yet so you can’t expect so much out of them.
"I got my tea.. I hope yoy have as well"  *me who doesn't like tea 👁👄👁*
That kid called his mom a baka
Thumbnail is the single best.
No that little boy is just like my little brother he beats everyone in my house 💀💀
"THAS NAWTIE" i cant breathe
i just read an article that said some kid burned his house down after appearing on the show
I'm a nineteen year old mother to three boy's. They all share the same father. Me and my husband are married with our own house and I'm a stay at home mother. I appreciate daz for bringing light to a mothers job
don't worry Daz I'm not getting anyone pregnant, im gay
0:00 Iggy?      iykyk
I always get period ads in his videos 😭😂
Daz is an amazing person
Daz is funny HAHAHA
*pauses vid to make tea*
note to my future self: ✍ bite ✍ child ✍ when ✍ they ✍ misbehave ✍
Omg his dog is so cute
Shame on the 106 people that disliked
Plzzzz watch the Minyon family on super nanny it’s my family before I was born plz
daz you should react to six the musical or Millie O'Connell!
We had a naughty step but it was next to the lounge-room so I could see the TV, it wasn’t much of a naughty step. I got the step and my siblings had to go to their room 😂
All Ik is that if I did that to my parents chancla
Completely disagree on having to take care of the kids she always has the choice to abort if she doesn’t want to care for them alone she can abort.
Bruh
I love your videos
😂 im not a kid person. Id drop-kick these two kids so fast- im the Badass Auntie in the family now. And Auntie dont play games.   "Come here come here- GO MAKE ME A FIRE OUTSIDE-.. THATS RIGHT THATS RIGHT ... Clean off the ground and put some sticks in a pile kiddos.. because your camping tonight" 😂   (But this was a very sad situation. ;w; and sometimes people can't do much or dont know what to do.  Support helps alot )
Father of 3 here. Tis hard, but fuck I love being a dad!
Dude how do the  younger get terrific  kid if the younger child is literally screaming and punch the mom??
I already know this is my favourite video without watching it
The puppy 🥺🥺🥺🥰🥰🥰 stole my heart
you are so insperational daz love the speech on the end
Little girl at 12:56 actually lookss like Daz a bit.
0:02 OMG IGGYY
Awe cute dog💚💙
My lovely African mom would have sent me to an early grave😃
Yeesss part 2 plzzzzz
I’d chuck the little bugger over the rail into the river !
If those kids belonged to my mum, they would see Jesus before the next day.  If those kids belonged to me, their school be wondering why they got a black eye. If they belonged to me mum, school be wondering why they're dead.
when I was younger my mom used to put me on the washing machine because I was too small and couldn’t get down😭
the dog is so cute💕
The fact that the child was able to bite the mother and get away with it without punishment was impressive.  One time I was playing and my mom called me inside and we had to stay in for the rest of the night and I was mad of course but we never even got close to talking back in any way shape or form. But my dumb ass muttered under my breath and she heard...... let’s just say I got whooped to another plain of being.  Like if that child bit MY MOM ooooh he would have died......
You cannot!Cannot! Say that you dislike his videos!
“They’ve got their kids all lined up, like little nazis” - Daz Black
Omg I loved that video and I was watching a movie and someone’s name was Linda lol
Can we all agree that Daz's laugh is more contagious than covid
I feel as if you were super nanny, you would've brought a belt 😂
I really hope if I ever have kids one day; they aren’t like those kids🙂
If I even did a quarter of what these kids did do my mom would have whooped my ass six ways to Sunday now I do believe in punishing your child in that way there is a difference between abuse and punishing them for doing something wrong like I'm not going to belt my kid for messing up in school but if he talks back to me I might consider it we need to not be abusive to our children but we need to also be firm and not let them get away with s*** like this
i wanna part 2
Daz talking about dads needing to not run off My dad: wait what
IF YOU WERENT A IDIOT FLIP EM ON THERE STOMACH AND SMACK THERE ASS OR DONT GIVE EM THE ATTENTION
If I were the parent I would fake die after they punch me. They'd be so traumatized that they'd stop.
I bit my brother when I was a child and my mum did the same,she bit me.it worked,I didn't bite anyone again
Yes men need to realize that it’s as much of their fault as it is the woman’s. It pisses me off, you chose to do it so you have to stay.
I noticed something... he's only been watching the video for 1:53 seconds.. And it's been 13:35 seconds... HOW
Epic Dog
I'm out of tea
My mum was always a good mum and I learnt quickly from her, these were her ways of teaching me: 1.If I had a tantrum in the middle of the shops she would just carry on walking and leave me there and I would eventually get up and follow because I didn’t want to be left alone. 2. If I bit one of my siblings I got bit by my mum. 3. If I was to noisy in the car I got the ruler to the wrist. 4. If I didn’t clean my room she brought the bin inside and chucked all my toys in there or she put all my toys in the entry where I couldn’t touch them until I was willing to clean and not play with the toys. 5. Sometimes if we were naughty we would get the bare bottom slap and oh lord that hurt or we would get the look. 6. If I swore I got my mouth washed out with soap.  But this isn’t abuse, it’s discipline and it worked well, all the parents these days don’t know how to parent and they are trying to be their kids best friend but the kid just needs proper discipline like I got and look at me now, I’m actually to scared to be naughty cuz I know what will happen if I do be naughty.
Instead of putting me in a naughty corner my dad just put me under the stairs and locked it Harry Potter style
I'm getting second hand stress from these kids
Just trying to use the bathroom and Daz does the mom stare. Not again. 😩
i have the same exact dog as u but mime is a dog and it’s the same breed as urs
"Oh she's got them lined up.Like little Nazis."
Seeing Daz talk to Gizmo makes me so happy :)
the hi of the devil
Hahahahaha, my grandmother when she was raising my dad and Aunty has a friend come over and she brought her kid and the kid would bite my Aunty so my grandma did what dazes mum did and but the kid, but not hard to draw blood, just enough so she doesn’t do it again
As a single mom of 3 kids Daz made me cry. I know it sounds crazy but this channel has been my only escape since the world shut down and for months I fell asleep to Daz’s videos so I wouldn’t cry myself to sleep. Bless you Daz
#34 on trending let's goooooo
When I tell you I’ve been waiting for daz to react to this
He told that story four years ago
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THISSSSS
Your dog has grown so much! I remember the video when he was first introduced! 💕😌
9:16🤣🤣
There is nothing more utterly terrifying as a mum look, like I’m 20 years old and I’d still shit myself! 😂 we need to see you react to super nanny doing her thing.
U watered the dog?????🐶🚿
Wait you broke up with your girlfriend
Come on Daz, please don't tell me you're buying into this culture of believing masculinity is bad. It is perfectly fine to tell MEN to MAN UP. I love watching your channel, but I won't if you stop speaking your mind or buying into the whole gender/masculinity nonsense. There is nothing wrong with masculinity, and there is no such thing as toxic masculinity. Woman can be just as horrible as men. Please don't go woke on us, you're spot on most of the time. Say what you think and don't apologize or feel bad. Words can't hurt you, and if people can't take it... they also need to man the fuck up and stop being offended by everything
Omg I’ve been waitinggg for thisss
Alright that’s what you’ll get and my BOOT!
The dog at the beginning * ^ *
WE NEED A DOG CAM
14:43 this made me cry um. Im 18 and my moms an angel id die for her, ive been suffering with very bad depression and i dont think ill ever do anything with my life. My dad is just horrible. One time he said in a text that he just wants to get this child support over with and in doing so to also permanently get rid of us as in "hes tired of us". And well he accomplished that. What makes it worse is that before all that they got back together when i was like 11 or 12 idfk, and i genuinly liked him. He even bought me a candy bar which ive never tried but i loved it alot. It just really hurts because i though he cared and he doesnt. Sorry for ranting, i feel better now. Just had to get that out even if no ones gonna read this.
I'm sorry but I'm 19 and I was that kid... I would still not have the patience to not smack them around... I would have legit left the house I cant even understand how much patience that mom has Bless moms like this.... truly!
You legit reminded me to take my birth control😂😭 THANK YOU🙏🤣
Smack them for gods sake. If me or my sister and brother did half of what they were doing our ass would be red from the wooden spoon.
OH MY GOSH THE 🐕 DOG HE LOOKS JUST LIKE HIS DAD HOW CUTE
My school gave a me certificate for getting slammed into a fence in football
Ur dog looks like iguana from JoJos bizarre adventure
If I would of even yelled at my mama she would’ve whooped my ass through 6 dimensions and I would be with Jesus 😂
GOD THAT 4  YEAR OLD GOT A TEMPER
My little brother is two and hits harder than that four-year-old lol
My uncles dogs name is gizmo and looks just like urs lol
8:33 lmaooooo same 😭😭😭😂😂
Even though I may not agree with the many things you state Daz, you are still alright.
Could you please make a video on people with no friends because it is an important topic and should be covered 😁
my girlfriend and i have been watching daz for the past two months (since we've been together) he has been cracking us both up so much to the point where there were tears involved (laughing wise) keep up the good work daz!
You are such a good guy, almost everyone of your Daz Watches has a message behind it and I love that. Thank you for all you do Daz, you absolute legend.
I’d really like to see Daz react to Dance Moms. Now that’d be a rollercoaster ride!
I use to watch super nanny with my nan the kids make my blood boil
It’s ok at least you’re not a single lonely man with a cat👍
EEEEEEK DAZZZZZZZZ U ALWAYS BRIGHTON MY DAYYYYYY EEEEEEEEEEEEEK
Broooooooooooo I once threatened to slap my mom when I was 7 and all she had to do was stare into my soul and bust out mom voice and I was like "....nah". Also me and Daz had the same biting punishment, my mom told me when I was like 1 or 2 I bit her and she took my arm and bit me back(NOT HARD just enough to shock me)and I never bit anyone lmao
Daz's story about him mocking his mum while her back was turned has me in stitches. Mum's really do have an extra sense specifically for when we're being little shits.
Perfection
When he did the mom look my heart dropped
This whole situation could have been solved with a slap
Who else wants more Gizmo? 😂🐶
Omg, when he said “ I got my tea, I hope you have yours”, I was shoving a burrito in my mouth. I paused, and was like, ‘well, close enough’.
When he was saying don’t run off if you get a girl pregnant I was like my dad needs to watch this
Some parents just get the worst kids. People really are just the luck of the draw. Like my mom was raised with whooping and she didn’t want to do that to us, but she got some good listening, quiet bio kids. The worst I ever got was grounded for a day. Then my parents started adopting and my little siblings are wild hitting and tantruming almost everyday and whoopings are definitely back. Can hardly go two days without one of them getting grounded.
I love the dog. havent even watched the video yet...
4:40 he has a good point.
Bless, watching super nanny makes me sad :(
I'm sorry Daz I shoulda subed a lond time ago
PT 2!!!!!!!!
i’ve always been told i was a good kid… do i believe it? absolutely not. 💀
I’ve got a dog just like urs it’s a Boston terrier and 7yrs old and the size of the width of my chest (btw I’m flat chested)
Make a kid addicyrd to a thing you bought and take the thing away that'll fix the problem
the second I talk to my mother like that, I get sent to Jesus same day shipping
If i even looked at my mom funny i got the mom stare. My mother is a scary person because she doesn’t get angry easy but when she does freakin run
daz i just rembered something mr fluffly has been sitting down for 7 years please go say hello to him D:
Dazzler nanny 2.0 but instead of the naughty spot its the hot kettle pot
Wholesome content-daz 2021  Also daz while playing horror games “it’s the scary bitch, stay away”
Elite tier show
Every other race: how the fuck did he not die?!
Sometimes I think for the ones they couldn't help they paid them off to be good for that last part of the show so they just got paid off to be good just for the cameras and once the cameras off they can go back to screaming and yelling LOL
Oh birth control
I watched this a lot with my mom growing up. It was hilarious 😆
Send those two children down to the Caribbean to live with me and TRUST me they will come back as the most disciplined children ever.😉😉😌😌
I feel bad for the mum 😞 because kids go through stuff that will make them a good person or a horrible person in the end
I agree Daz have s*x like an adult, take responsibility like an adult
Why hasn't the dogo got their own merch already?! 😤  We must have Gizmo merch! 🤣
Sarah has the best dad ever! Xx 😚 you make my day!
Daz, ILY, but you're not nanny material, you literally wanted to drop kick a child across the room xD
*ShOrTeNeD sEnTeNcE or FrEeDoM*
Daz: And joe frost is dressed like an ikea couch   *me literally dying of laughter* 😂💀
you should react to the life of luxury channel, it has really creepy videos i think you’d like
If you don't want to have a kid thats ladies choice if men say no to have a baby thats not happening men have no decision
I want gizmo I want a frenchy terrier
At the beginning of the vid he talks like he doesn’t have a kid already
The nanny looks like principal Trunchbull from Matilda
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make.  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
iggi
That 4 year old is asking to get dropped kicked in the head like a soccer ball
Your dog is so cute 🥰🥰🐕
I haven’t seen your dog before I think even though I’ve been following you on YouTube for YEARS and he looks like your perfect match for your dog. Like appearance wise he looks like he would be your dog.
I used to watch this with my mom, I don’t t know how I could stand it
Cute dog
for a second, when the kid first punched his mother, i thought the mom hit him
I'm not even a second into the vid but my prediction is that he will want to smack the everliving shit out of the children
my dream dog is a boston!!!
If i shouted my mother even at 6 or 7 she would give me a swift cross punch to the jaw 😂
i'd beat my kids with a belt if they did this ..
*Daz watches Super Nanny*  First quote: “0:41”
I’ve been waiting for this one
If I was those kids mom I would beat the sh*t out of them kids
Lol
Gizmo is a cute puppy 😍
Awwwwww
That super saiyan child nearly made me choke on my sweet iced tea
Awwwwwwwww Gizmo is SO CUTE
Don't let your son hit you! Discipline him. I don't understand parents that allow their kids to do that
I feel for the mom and kasey (not sure how to spell it) mainly cus I’ve been in this situation myself as the “good kid who gave up on getting the attention” my sister has and still is exactly like that, the screaming and hitting, and my dads so stressed that I learned from a young age to take care of myself and keep to myself. It’s a sad and lonely position to be in
Hi 😐
My dogs name is also gizmo
8:23 ah yes I do make goldfish sounds at my mum
daz back at it again
The intro was adorable
See. My death would have been assured if I ever hit my mom
You don't need no super Nanny you just need an asian parent, Hehe because these kids are gonna get destroyed.
WATCH MORE SUPERNANNY
Can you do another Uncharted  series again or another game series like it also there might be a uncharted movie if you didn’t know
My mom beated the crap out of anyone that thinks would be rude. We are nice grown ups now. No one in hospital or psychologically hurt. We still love her. This mom needs to know her rights and what limits are.
Did he get a new dog? Does he still have the one from Vine?
I was a pretty chill child never screemed never did anything uneccisary............90% of the time,p.s such a cute little puppy 🥰😘
Ur dog is so cute😭
7:21 THE CUT OFF LMAOOO
Yep, this is why I do not want kids. Ever.
And that's why adoption centres are a thing
I would love to see Daz watch Nuke Top 5 videos
Ngl, bit my mum once - more than once I think, when I was about 3 - when she finally lost it, she bit me back. I never bit anyone again!
Pleeeeease do more of this series! Ones that have the end too
6 HOURS AGO
.....growing up if i threw any of this I'd just get flicked in the forehead trust me anyone who understands the power behind a decently hard flick, will shut up and sit down, before the next one
AWWWWWWW YOUR PUPPY IS SO CUTE❤️❤️❤️
What da dog doin’
Omgggg DAZ’S DOG IS SO CUIUUUTE
Daz you might not see this but can you react to doctor doggos 7 creepy and cursed compilation pls
I've never done this shit because I always worked so I never really caused problems.
Please please make this a series!!!!!!!!!
I’ve been binge watching suppernanny all week and I see this video come up 😂
Next can you do World's Strictest Parents
WE NEED MORE 😂!!!!!!!
You should play blood wash it’s a pixilated horror game
My face when I saw that dog : :0   ( I was so miserable and daz very much made my day so so so so so much better (
i think the “thing” about her that bugs me is that she works with kids (specifically the worst behaving ones) and enjoys it
my mom and dad told me that they read her book and watched the show before they had kids 😭   I would say I was a pretty good kid 😏
Wait daz your dog looks like iggy is from jojo the anime look it up
When I was in primary school, I got a certificate, given at a school assembly so the whole school. The certificate was for being on time to school for a whole week 😂😂 the thing is I lived in the street beside the school with a walkway right next to my house
Yeah The Mom stare is horrifying
Daz being wholesome as hell in this one. I approve much
If they did this to me I’d boot them across the room
IMO 😂😂😂😂
I want to see more videos of this lol
Sorry but bring spanking back little shits
you said the mother flipping story before, I was watching your older videos a few days ago - you said it almost the same way haha
Gizmo fits so Well with Daz
Can you please stop pausing all the time
My mother’s favourite punishments with me were the pink prison cell basically she would take absolute everything out of my room picture toys and I’d be left with a completely bare room and id have to earn things back another one was a drive up to the mountains and she’d say she’d leave my there now she has three more kids she never punished because she would rather not listen to them 😐
Moral of the story is dont have kids unless u prepared to give them up for adoption
Cute 🐶
Lonely men with a daughter and a dog
Wholesome content😌
I know it’s not good to hit your kids but If they were mine they would have permanent hand marks on them
with the like 4yr old reece or however u say it - he probably picked up a bit of his actions and luangage from his surrounding when he was younger because most of the time thats what young kids do.
cute dog
8:48 oh I thought you got in trouble just for playing the drums to loud or some shit
got ‘em all lined up …  *like little nazis*  -daz, 2021
The dad went to get some milk 🥛
There's a esay fix to that grab a belt And raise your arm and beat the soul out of him
Awww he’s so cute
Joe... JOE MOMMA
I reckon Reece needs to be put down
This feels like something you would have already watched but you haven’t and it’s hilarious!😂
THE DOGG IS SO CUTE
Daz please bring back the banned game part 2😩
Dooogy
Don’t lie daz you don’t see anything in the dogs eyes there’s not a thought between them
I am very unimpressed that Daz as a fellow British man referred to maths as math...
I am currently sick and lave ur vedios make me really beater
I wish we could get a video of you with your mom reacting to some videos like this one.
The best birth control is hypixel skyblock
I remember the naughty step and it wasn’t my mum who scared me it was my dad 😂😭I also remember sticking 2s up at my dad and he said “put them fingers down young lady I’ve got eyes at the back of my head 💀😂
OMG daz legit described my mom perfectly xD
5:15 my mom used this trick too. I used to bite my sister, so my mom warned me that if I did it again she would bite me. I did it again, and she bit me. I think I stopped after that—
This always makes my day 😂
You know what Daz, belt was made by a very smart person.
True mums silent stare is scary especially the Indian mum
4:13  Felt that
What a beautiful, dazzling, amazing dog
Or and here me out tazzer
FINELY I HAVE BEEN WATCHING AND WAITING FOR SOO LONGG
In the pacific bruh swearing at mom would be the last few words you say lmao
So cute
It’s right what you’re saying about being a dad. My son is 21 now and his “sperm donor” walked out of his life when he was 4 months old, and has never looked back. No birthday cards, Xmas cards or anything. Just vanished and left me to bring him up. I was 19 what I had him. I didn’t have a clue what I had to do. It was tough to put it mildly
FINALLY! HE WATCHES SUPER NANNY! I love this show
Daz you are the reason I watch YouTube
YESSS been waiting for this!!
Dazes next vid: how’s it going dazzlers! welcome back to Daz games and today we are going to be cosplaying super nanny!
our dogs have the same name :0 NICE
I didn't see anything occur with the super nanny actually do anything with resolving these children.
Just you wait the second the nanny is gone those kids will remove wings to reveal red hair and fangs and kill their mom and then replace their mom with a perfect one
My mom would have beat my ass doing any of that
New trailer for mortal combat 😂
Daz saying this with a daughter: 🤫
I thought she was made up, i watched South Park and I laughed so hard
It’s my birthday YALL
I keep thinking you’re 700k subs but you way popular and I bet your viewers that actually subscribe is 99% your humble
DAZ YOU SHOULD REACT TO MOM SWAP
Baby!!!! ❤
They say a dog looks like their owner   I can now confirm this is true
When I was a kid and I’d get very angry I’d bite. My aunts told me I used to stomp my foot, grit my teeth and then run at them and bite. Thank you for reading my weird childhood fact.
I would love to see daz do a supernanny sketch haha

I’ll never have kids  Because I can’t look after myself And they are a holes  And we can’t hit kids to punish them
Yo Daz I watch Supernanny a lot!😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖
Im 16 and I don’t dare disrespect my parents nor my elders,they taught me to say thank you and no thank you at the end of EVERYTHING I would say and if i talked back or if a was being rebellious i wiuld get beat and hell if i still disrespect anyone like this id get beaten but j dont since i learned and both my mother and father and I and  my brother have a loving relationship
“AAAAAAAA! He’s biting!” That had me wheezing😂🤣
If you're able, pleeease react to more supernanny!!
hey daz, you should play Identity Fraud Revamp (its on roblox) its a horror game where you are stuck in a maze with different monsters that try to kill you obviously. you have to make it out of all the different mazes, each maze has different monsters. i think it will make a very funny video💀✋
Today is my birthday
She’s got nothing on Nanny McPhee
JAKE PAUL VS. THE 3 MEAN CHILDREN!
Oooo can we know how you make your tea ☕️
Hey guys welcome back to giz games today were KILLING MY OWNER
I would have literally put that toddler in a FUCKEN hospital
I hope you see this, but I think you should make a new account called daz watches so you can do games on dAz games and watching stuff on daz watches
If I did even the slightest thing that these kids did with their mom. My parents would decapitate me😂😂😂😂
In primary school I got a certificate for being at least 5 minutes late every day without fail.
Awww! I just love Daz!! He’s a beautiful soul
I hated this part of the show. I grew up in a household where if I made a tantrum like that about anything and hit my mom... My mom would slap me into tomorrow. She had a saying "I will slap you so hard the wall will hit you back". Okay it wasn't normal and I got quite the anxiety in my adult life...
I live with 7 siblings and if we ever act like this with our mom, we'd die on the spot XD
Daz can you say hi 👋
And your Supernanny video the problem with the kids is no physical punishment usually kids that don't get physically punished so they grow up like that like that and think they are the baddest people in the world when they become adults
If had a kid there’s no way I would just leave my child
I never been happier you reacted to this 🙏
Dad?
Daz always hitting me in the irls. Dont get pregnant kids. If you do have a back up plan just in case you dont get financial support. Not every guy that says he loves you will actually be there for you. Also wait until your an adult at the very least if you have kids you'll have more opportunities to be able to support them.
This dog is actually iggy I stfg
Those kids are lucky it’s illegal to hit a kid. I’m just sayin bro
Thank you Daz for talking to your young male viewers influencers have more power than you realize so hopefully you reach these young boys as a woman that had a baby with a horrible guy I appreciate that
Please react to "Nanny 911"
<3 Daz
That poor kid giving up getting attention I can't imagine what is going through her mind especially because her siblings are getting attention
Same
SO HAPPY RN
Love your vids
I would put him up for adoption
That’s what my Anna’s old dog was called
damn the kids swearing already, im nearly 20 and i still dont swear, mostly because i dont like to anyways but still
A lot of people blame the absentee fathers for the kids behaviour but I don't think that's right. I'm a single mom of three girls and my children have never behaved this way. If you start using discipline when they are little (and I'm not talking about spanking) I don't see how you could end up with children who act like this. If you let them get away with this kind of behaviour of course they are going to keep doing it and even see what else they can get away with and it gets out of control like with this poor mom. You can't allow it. A single mom is perfectly capable of raising loving, well behaved children just as much as a family with a mother and father. It's all about the parenting and how you raise them.
if I did this I would be dead 7:39
Daz your mom would be proud of you being s parents right now, she like “that’s my boy” in that lady voice I could only imagine you wheezing of laughter behind the screen
I work with kids, and I can deal with almost anything apart from biting and spiting.
I commeted for him to do this I’m so happy😭
You need to watch one more super nanny when Joe comes to America. Those children were tame compared to some of the ones in my country.
I have no intention of becoming a father anytime soon, but in the event that i do get a girl pregnant, ill stick around and raise the kid as best as i can, i wont just take off and bail! My own father left shortly after i was born and i never even had the chance to meet him, so if i ever do become a father, wether intentionally or otherwise, I’m not gonna bail like he did!
Gizz is just sooooo cute
That intro was fucking amazing lmaooo
Daz...you're a solid dude. 👌
If I acted like that my mom would have hit me so hard I would have went air-born
Thank you for these vids daz you just turned my frown upside down
OML GIZMO LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE MY DOG DARLA
You’re the best!!!
Daz...do we need to talk about watering your dog because you don't water a dog you give water to a dog?
You’re not wrong every mom does that
ayooo they crippin
Yep flipped my mum of as well
why is it that every time i watch one of your videos a pamprin ad shows up-
9:17 when a girl checking you out "Daz" Thats when you know your gonna die!
People water there dogs now??
You should watch wife swap
I had to babysit a kid like him and it was so hard, I did not get paid enough. It was so mentally draining
I swear daz would be the best super nanny he would solve all the problems
You know I feel like crap right now but this video had made me better
i had a boston terrier he was the best dog ive ever had he died in 2018 and i grew up with him
People in the US are the same way pop out a ton of kids for benefits it’s sad and not fair for these kids no wonder they have behavior problems
Can’t get enough of that beautiful dog! Gah! Plus god haha remember super nanny. Classic
You need to watch more I love your reactions
... I agree that men shouldn't just run off and all, but... Having a kid is a two-way agreement. If the guy did literally everything in his power to avoid getting a child during sex and used protection and all and the girl still decides to have the child and not get an abortion, I think it's pretty damn selfish to drag the boy into it and make him be a father, when the decision was hers to take. Yes there's always a risk of getting a girl pregnant and a girl decides over her own body, of course, but if the boy did everything to avoid getting a child, he shouldn't be stuck with one he clearly didn't want to have... One shouldn't force people into parenthood, if they're not ready to be a parent..
BAHAHAHAHAHAHA!! I can’t breath daz you kill me   Look at supper nanny standing there like a curtain bahahahaha I’m dead 💀😂😂😂😂💀
my mum bit me after i bit her lmao 😭
Funniest reaction video till date on daz channel
He is so funny and this video will be so and I like your videos i like his videos all the time
Like little natzis 😂😂😂 dad I love you😂 happy cloud
14:44 what if I’m 19 my hole life ahead of me and the condom splits or something and she doesn’t want an abortion she wants the baby but i dont that’s why i wore the protection what do I do then
Thanks for helping set guys straight, my husband has run off several times leaving me with no life, as I have to watch the child/pets; take care of the mess he left behind, (all he did was drink and complain, and destroy our home). I’m finally divorcing him, so I can be free to love again, but he still feels he has no responsibilities. Throw a little cash, and I do mean a little, and he’s good? No! It’s MY time, MY life being taken up. And although I’d never leave my son, and do what he did to him, (which is heartbreaking to the child), I get no appreciation or anything for the sacfices I make, and have to fight for everything! Court is in 2 weeks, wish us luck! HIs actions will play against him! You’re the best Daz, my son and I watch you together! You make us smile and laugh and remind us we don’t need to be treated poorly!❤
I finally understand why the primary 1s in my school are so violent…
There’s full episodes that are like 40 minutes (tv series!) I’d love to see your reaction to how she works with the family because the results are always amazing! I love you so much daz I admire your message to you g men out there about being responsible and not leaving the girl they could possibly get pregnant alone. Thank you for not making it about masculinity but about doing what’s right because there wouldn’t be a baby without the sperm too so genuinely I admire you so much for putting that basic knowledge out there cause you’re right they don’t tell you that in sex education classes 🥺💕
Just saying sometimes it's okay to backhand a child
IGGY!!!!!!!!
Whats wrong with over Authoritive working women you dont like... there just doing their job. Jeez daz. 🙄  Btw.. what happened to that nice good looking girl you were going out with before... now your single.. i wonder why. Hmmm. Perhaps she met someone better. 😅 Also they are HORRIBLE HORRIBLE KIDS!!
I just love how he always explain completely irrelevant to the video like “dinosaurs were around 1 millions of years ago and that’s why we’re watching a Logan Paul vlog” 😂
I like tea
Is your dog a stand user
My parents weren't afraid to get the belt if I even came close to acting like those kids did at the beginning. Definitely made me learn respect
Finally daz black has reacted to supernanny I wonder if he will disaplin his daughter or future grandchildren in that way
Gizmo needs his own gaming chair
You make my day better and you make me laugh
daz; there is nothing more scary than s stern mum i once as a little kid smashed something i cant remember what it was but i was angry and it was on purpose. Rhe look my mum gave me couldve frozen over hell  and i never broke anything again like that
If those were my kids they'd be getting the BELT smak smak there back to normal lmao
Guys he’s almost at 6.9M subs we can get there
Daz is single?
you sud wach  the  sqwid games
Pt 2 plz
Give Gizmo a kiss for us Daz please I love him
Thank you Daz for standing up for what's right I wish more men were mature like u and accepted that being a dad shouldn't be a choice if u had sex
I'm sorry to tell you this but your dog when he gets older is going to have a lot of health problems it is going to be a lot of money I can already tell you right now he's going to have problems with one or two eyes and his breathing when he gets older so let's hope nothing happens like that plus his right eye already seems to be acting up in this video it already doesn't look good
can you make reacting to supernanny as a series please x
“ ohh my god.. some kid is about get dropped kicked across the living room” 💀💀
She’s like nanny McPhee 💀
He looks like my lost dog and has the name of my lost dog 😭😭😭😢😢😢
The stare that mothers do it feels like your soul leaves your body 😂
When you realise that you act like them
My mom use to say she had eyes in the back of her head that is what daz games is saying ps remember the tv show Malcolm in the middle where the mom was shouting at Malcolm that he was grounded for not cleaning up his room the she shouts fore Christ sake Reese there's a mirror right there and it was at that moment that Reese stopped mocking him mom Lois
Please react to more Super Baby Daz, your commentary with the reaction alone is priceless 😂❤️
Ummm... Mabey take them to a meantal hospital or mabey call the police or the PRIEST BC THESE KIDS R DEMONS I SWEAR-
in america i feel like it's more common to have your kids stand with their face in a corner rather than something like a naughty spot.  and whenever i fought with my cousin when i was younger, my grandma would make us sit on the floor and hold each other's hands and say i love you until she decided we were done
Where has his loud laugh gone 🥺 I love that laugh!
Shannon Shannon it’s named Shannon 😂😂 the kids just like me
Your dog looks like it's smoking crack Btw hes so cute
I’ve wanted him to react to this since I started watching Daz 2 years ago lol
This is just the average day in my house
“Got them all lined out like lit tile nazis “ idk if I spelt it correct
The only thing I ever fought to my mum and dad about was when I couldn’t WEAR MY PRINCESS DRESSES
Awww cute puppy
I used to have a cat named Gizmo and since your dog is named the same thing we all we used to call him Gizzy bug as his nickname just saying it's pretty good one
If my kids were like this all you'd hear is "everybody was kung fu fighting"
Daz needs to watch ‘how clean is your house’
Joe frost is dressed like an IKEA couch……
Wait what day is single I thort he lives with his gf  or wife and his daughter
I had a dog named Gizmo too hahaha!
“She’s got them all lined up, just like little Nazis.” this is officially my favorite and funniest daz watches
Im sorry but the dog is just amazing
12:53  when the woman picked the kid up, honest to god, thought she was going to chunk him over the bridge 💀 LOL
Oh daz shrunk
Life Lessons With Daz
A little ass whoopin is good every now and again.
I got an award for doing the most laps around the school corridors
Belt would fix kid quick
At 12:52 I would've just thrown the child in the water to be honest (・∀・)
I have a boston terrier girl and she's abouslety beautiful she's so much fun and loving
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!!
sorry but if my child was kicking and biting me. i would throw them out the fucking WINDOWWWWWWWWWW
Is daz a dog or a cat person?
Min 9 your have said this before
i agree
Your. Dog. Is... DAZZLING!! it's so cute
When I was little I used to walk up the stairs and keep 1 toe on the step XD I was hell
"Pull my hair back and put me in blue" made my day pmsl XD
"He is just beating the p!s$ out of his mum-" i-i cant breath🤣 daz, u make me day all the time thank you for always being there <3
If the 4 year old was my kid the kids getting drop kicked off a bride and if they live boom orphanage
“Right in the tit” 😂 funny video but ending is sadly true!
Kick the child
Here is a solution sacrifice the small one.
Your dog looks so cute!!!❤
our dogs look the exact same daz ❤️ gizmo and murphy best friends forever
“And young boys, if you get a girl pregnent” I WONT HAVE TO WORRY! I”M GAY!!!!
You should react to the start and the ending and make this a series 😝☺️
i got 2 dads
I would love to see him react to Keeping up with the kardashians 😂
Daz: everyone watches super nanny and doesn’t want kids  Me: I watch super nanny and want kids
HI DAZ IM A BIG FAN AND U NEVER FAIL TO MAKE A SMILE😁😁😁
if i behaved that way i wouldn't be writing this comment rn because my mother would've whooped my ass into another dimension
daz is the mum we all wanted and needed growing up🥺❤️
Hidden memory unlocked
Early!
The beginning is great but the thumb nail is Hume flipping us off
You need to react to more of these
Hit him
give me an hour with those kids, i bet they’d behave
"like little Nazis" can relate, when I associate stuff my brain goes random, before I associate with normal things
God luv ya Daz! Absolutely so so proud of u for the messages you r sending out! Thank u! 🙏😎💖
If little kids are this bad that a parent can't control them then the parent needs to send them to behavioral therapy! I was in a behavioral therapy classes a few times as a little girl. There were two other students in the class. A boy and a girl. The girl Tia, she would through horrible tantrums so much! There was a walk in closet sized room in the classroom. She would get put in there, where there was nothing but soft pillows and beanbags and she'd be left to scream her head off as the rest of us had to ignore her and give her no attention for throwing any tantrums while in that room. I don't remember what happened to either of them, but I can remember I was afraid of Tia cause she'd scream and get all red in the face. She might have been violent I can't remember but she was so intimidating.  Funny thing is I didn't need behavioral therapy. I was well behaved. So it just might have been me being upset or something for me to get sent to behavioral therapy. But Hell, even if I was grumpy or upset towards my mom back then, I swear there's no way I was ever like Tia! Going there and experiencing Tia was so scary, I think I probably chilled out a lot more after seeing that girl go mental on tantrums!
7:57 LOLLLLL
I I thought when daz said if ur child bites that he would say punch their teeth out
Your Dog is so cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My dog's name is Gizmo aswell
My mum doesn’t worry about me bc I’m always on my ipad
Daz and his mum impression had me dead lol
You and Hugh could pull it off lol
So is giz replacing hue?
U gotta make this a a series🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏  Supernanny ftw
My sister used to bite me and my mum said hit her back if she does it again she only tried it one more time 😂
I had such a terrible day. And this video. Helped a lot.
my mom just smacked the shit out of me. literally just slapped me. and if i said something bad, she’d put LIQUID soup in my mouth. and i was a bad ass kid. he needs to be smacked in the mouth fr
I’m sorry but these kids are just asking for a slap, I would not have the patience
I swear daz should react to nikocado avocado
0:18 DAZ WATERS HISSS DAWGG
What breed is gizmo ?
Dog
Daz the Wise   Can we get part 2 of Devotion, please?
The next skit you do...you need to be Super Nanny! That'd be funny as hell!!!
I remember my mum watching this and telling me to learn from it
D O G
Looking slim daz keep it up !
Great video mate
His mum: U ARE BEING NAUGHTY  My mum and dad: *Rowen, shut up*
We need to see more of gizmo
9:56 broski unleashed his inner hulk
you put it very well at the end of the video. If you get someone pregnant, it becomes your responsibility to give that kid the exact same if not more opportunities than you were given. Don't jsut walk out and say "well there other single parents, so you can do it too." Stay around for the child, that child is part of you, that child is you, treat them as you would treat yourself, cause they are a part of you.
I thought vanilla ice killed iggy but here he is
My sister tried leading me to my balcony to jump off
When you get that look you know your going to see if there is a afterlife in the next 20 seconds
This is class everything in this my mom did 😂😂 amazing first time I have laughed like this in a while
omg my moms old family dogs name is gizmo too and he was also a Boston terroir!
best week ever, huw twice in one week, daz playing horror and reacting and then daz and giz
I'm a pullout champ, no kids for me💀
OMG UR DOG IS SO CUTE❤️
iggy, jojo reference ;)
Iggy?
The ol’ Asian beating always worked when I was a kid
oh she's a REAL good mom bc girl.....they done lost they damn minds.
And this is the reason i drop kick children in self defense
Happy birthday to me❤🎉🎊 thanks daz for posting on my special day!!!
It is like my younger brothers with my sister
That look is know as "the mother of satan eye" worst then any other punishment
Why do gizmos ears look so dark on the inside is that normal?
I love your dog 🐶
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS FOR I DON’T KNOW HOW LONG!
PUPPYYYYYYYY!!!!!!
ooooh damn if I would try to hit my mom she would hit back and sent me flying out of the window 👀
👋👋
Your dog I so cute
Your very funny and it cured my depression
parenting tip: don’t have kids 🙂
NO!
The thing about the silent angry mom is So treu as a kid my mom Just stayed silent and most times i Just ran away and do my chores 😂😂
Those kids remind me of the purple minions 😂
Put him in a straight jacket for an hour
Hi Daz! Can you please to a Daz watches for the show called Dance moms?!
If I was the mom I woulda been like "I will slap the sh!t outa you if you don't stop... WHAT WAS THAT!!!" (children screaming intensifies)
Well it’s time out or a beating so you know.
Dad you need to watch that’ll teach em season 1 or season 3
I belive on rare occassion a soft swat on the bum is needed,if the child is violent toward someone.I knew a little boy who would headbutt people and kick them in the crotch and yell obscenities his parents did nothing to stop him.Eventually they tried timeouts and taking away privilleges,which did not work the violence escalated,when they finally swatted him he completly stopped his behavior.
Wouldn’t be surprised is this kid becomes a boxer some day lol
“She’s dressed up like an ikea couch” - daz 2021
I wouldn't have a Playstation for 2 years
I have that exact same dog
Mine was a bar of soap in the mouth if I ever misbehaved.
The naughty step didn't work with my sister. Not because she would run away, she had no problem staying in fact staying was the problem. When my mom would tell her it was over she would say  ''I like it here. You know what I think I'll stay'' She was supposed to be there for a few minutes but she was would spend the entire day there because ''She wanted to.''
The only thing scarier than a stern mom yelling is a quiet stern mom. The quiet before the storm
Who else saw his story where giz wouldn't let him edit
Typical Daz making a 2 minute video into a 15 minute video
OHH u water ur dog i should try that maybe it will groww
Is he a boston terrier? I have one, I had too but he passed sadly two months ago. Super cute!!
When I saw how they were standing I thought counjouring
2:00 is the best part
I'd be dead a million times over if I did half the stuff these kids did..
11:28 did he say kiss my willy 😁😂😂🤣🤣😅😆🤣
I was on the naughty step a few times once i stuck a pompon ball so far up my nose that I went to A and E just to escape
then the lil boy was starting hitting the mom i would of really yelled at the kid and told him what his consequents are and then send him to his room
Iggy!??!
She reminds me of a real life Nanny McPhee 😂
I would slap them into the next eara of evolution and handcuffed thos brads
Daz Gizmo is sooo cute😂
daz why did u need to yell BIRTH CONTROL my mum was next too me 😂😂
As a Mom, I can confirm, that is THE quiet, angry look. 😅
i honestly dont think ive laughed so much on a yt vid...thanks daz!
this is what happens when you don't beat your child. not in the abusive way but in a way that makes sure they're properly disciplined. diplomatic beating.
Daz: birth control we all need it  Me a huge lesbian: um yeah about that  Lol 😂 😂😂
Bruh aw hes so cute 00:22  The dogs fine too
Daz your dog is so cute. Just wanted to say. Really freaking cute dog. Makes me want a dog. But my dad said F NO lol
Puppy has grown so big since we last saw him...I love him, he steals the show.
If I EVER called my mum a båşťãřđ I WOULD BE PRACTICING HANDSHAKES WITH THE GRIM REEPER!!! My sister's would be like "what flowers are gonna be at the funeral?" I'D BE LUCKY TO GET A FUNERAL!!
When In kindergarten I stabbed my teacher and at the house I was bullying my sisters and at daycare a girl hit me with a toy so I waited till she was asleep and hit her with thr same toy
Hi, I think u should maybe do another collab with Carl and Alex… it was great fishing content and I love fishing and I think it would be great for both of you!
his dog is so fudging cute 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Why do we extend the right to choose to girls but not boys? It takes two to tango and all that. Ideally, just don't be a moron who takes the chance of creating a child that you aren't ready for.
plz do more videos on super nanny plz! thank you love ya!
I waited months for this thank you Dan😁😁😁
Love it when Daz updates, I need to get his merch!
“She’s a full-time Mom and a punching bag” I’m crying
Anyone got the number for Anakin Skywalker?
IGGY!!??!???
What about the nana
I clicked on video and can all ready tell it’s gonna be funny
Daz:” I know you wanna be on camera I know you’re up to my following gizmo…I can see it in your eyes🥺💅” This was cute and weird
You have no idea Daz! Every time I think I want kids and I don’t even like kids I watch this and change my mind haha!
Daz's single mom speach really hit home and I'm glad you said it Daz. My two siblings and I were raised by a single mom and growing up I matured pretty fast because I saw her struggle financially with no child support. Thankfully I can say neither of us as children gave my mom nearly as much grief as the kids in the video.
This is why I can’t have kids. If my kid hit me, I would drop kick him out the fucking window
When daz said his mom looked up and down, you know his mom is South African 🤣🤣
When I see shit like this, it makes me so glad to be a lesbian
I thought when the mom was on the bridge with the water under it I thought she was going to throw the kid off in the water
OMG OUR DOG LOOKS LIKE TWINS!
Come on we all know if our child bit us we would shove them in a cupboard and lock it until we Gary some HOLY WATER
Daz, you should watch figure skaters 😊 my favorite is Yuzuru Hanyu but there are so many talented people
“he’s going super saiyan” - best thing daz has ever said in the history of ever
I love your videos!
that was the best intro ever
DOGGY!!!  I haven't watched this show in ages, never thought Daz would react to it  I would smack the face off of some of these kids .
I was having a terrible day and watching this made me feel so much better. All of your videos are the best 🖤
3 words: hit the child.. 🙂
Jeez as an Arab girl...we would never dare even to look back at our parents because we know we would get punished or slapped so hard if we disrespected them..I am amazed how much disrespect this mom is getting
I love that you showed Gizmo Thank you so much I love gizmo so much He's so cute. I will share in like this video just because you showed Gizmo
Imagine how hard it will be for the kids on super nanny to get a job xD
Not gonna lie, Daz’s dog made my evening when I saw him!
WHY IS EVERYONE WEARING BLUE!!! He says bloo better than Boris Johnson
BRING THE BELT OUT MUM
Yep, all parents have 'the look' and it is way scarier than them shouting at you. I was never really punished as a kid, partly because I was quite a good kid and partly because that look was enough to get me to stop what I was doing or do what I was supposed to do immediately. Like I knew I was in serious trouble when the look came out. I've even learnt the look from my mum now and do it to my dad if he's annoying me and even he finds it scary.
Daz you should make a Reddit so we can give you funny memes and content for videos
What a thumbnail.
Ngl them kids would have got a smack back
Oh Yeah, i give my 2 oldest sons "the look" when they really messed Up,,, they det scared almost instantly 😄 i dont even have to do anything 😄
Daz would be an awesome super nanny!!😃
Its not that giz is miserable its just that hes looking in all directions
Love u dazzz!!❤️ Your so cool
Here before a day gang 😎👑
The moms deathstare was SPOT ON 😂😂😂😂😂
Ayooo daz ur dog is so cute 😀😀😀😀
who else jus likes before watching 5 seconds lol
I LOVE YOUR DOG OMFG
Awwwww the doggie ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🐢🐢🐢🐢🐢
That mom stare that daz did made me wanna look him in the eyes and immensely apologize
Super nanny is my favorite show. But the current supper nanny I’m watching is called America’s Super nanny and wow…. That family is WOW 😳😬
13:44 yessss Daz perfectly said 👏
He should react to dance moms it would be so funny
I’ve bitten my older sister when i was a kid once, on the elbow. And I kinda don’t regret it. I also kicked her in the face cause she was being a shit one day. And I don’t regret that. I was sent to my room, and now I don’t have the heart to hit anyone, just a pathetic smack is all I can do
A women with no kids advising parents with kids what to do??
I don't think that that was a screwdriver that the boy threw I think it was eathier a dart or a pen!
FINA -FUCKING- LY
Wanna know a certificate I got, best day dreamer in primary
I like ur cut g
Okay so I have nieces and nephews who can been SOOO spiteful towards their mothers, they sometimes dont listen.  But if I say their name in a certain tone, they look and I say "Apologise to your mother right now" and they do straight away. Its usually when they dont expect that one person they favour in the family to put their foot down, they do end up being like OH SHIT, I need to stop.  They don't always listen, but when they do you get this sense of relief!
Your dog is so cute xx
Americans get soap in the mouth for cussing spanked for not listening with a belt and they get the shit smacked out of them for back talking
My old friends family was on this show and it didn’t work
A video about little kids and the first sentence Daz said was: Birth control, we all need it😂
The first thing I thought when I clicked on the video was that YOU ARE SHINING TODAY ✨ You look amazing ❤️
Has the mom ever heard about less yelling and more consequences
Daz you should do a super nanny skit
Reacting to miss brown boys plzzzzzzzz its hilarious
I’m surprised no ones taking about nanny mc fee
daz... I need you to finish playing Devotion. please and thank you lol
Daz this was amazing plz do more of this
Nanny McPhee be like: sUpErNaNnY
Naughty step works for me! Also I've recently found out that asking nicely with a please and a thank you when they do what you ask really helps, he's nearly 3 and coming on an absolute treat 🥰 when he starts acting up its either because he's bored or tired, if he's rooting around for snacks it's because he's hungry! You just have to read the signs and lead by example, and don't under estimate the power of a nap! Establishing a nap time and reducing how long they sleep for depending on their age is brilliant becuase it's so good for their brain development, and it gives you at least an hour to yourself 😁
I HAVE BEEN OBSESSED WITH SUPERNANNY FOR SO LONG THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY
Yeah, birth control didn't work for me😂 Edit: If my boy hits me (he's nearly 3) I pretend to cry and say "you really hurt mummy" in a sad voice he soon feels sorry. I explain to him that not nice ect. Then I forgive him No naughty chair/stair/anything It works for us
Please never stop making content
@7:47 🤣🤣🤣🤣
If I cussed at my mom like that I would be killed lol 😂
My kids quickly learnt that mum stare meant trouble for them, we did have one that threw things and bit,he was diagnosed with autism. I wanted him to be able to cope with some changes, so if he was fixated on having a green plate he would get whatever colour I decided. Yes he would throw the plate across the room, but he did eventually learn to eat of any plate . I did have 2 certificates up lol, they where pupil of the year and they both mentioned about how lovely they where and a credit to us as parents . Now they are 18 (1st year of uni, luckily he has got drinking to extremes out his system after 2 hospital visits) my autistic son is at Sen college and wants to teach Sen primary, my youngest is almost 15 she is the hardest work lol, it's the hormonal mood swings .
"How to make a British nanny look like a British nanny  pull her hair back so tight the scalp is barley holding on"
That is a really cute dog daz
lmao my cat is named gizmo
When he said do you your tea I paused the video got up and went to go make tea and can back And unpaused 😂😂
I used to watch super nanny and it’s so awesome to see you watch it
Jojo reference IGGIE !!!!!!!!!!!
I loved this show so much (haven’t watched yet but so excited)
If the majority of men were like Daz, there wouldn't be so much feminists complaining about them in the world.
Best youtuber ever!!!!
We can all agree that he could never have a Russian or black mother he'd be dead.
i got belt of dad as kid
Growing up I'm glad I listened to my parents without question.. Mainly cause if I didn't I'd be dead Edit:response to daz talking about young men getting a women pregnant. If i got someone pregnant (which is unlikely cause im a fucking loner) even though im 17 i would never leave her, just thinking about the image about her being by herself raising a child alone makes me feel upset
Props to you daz for educating us young boys especially how to treat women and responsibility properly  Good for you daz much love
We need more Dazes on the internet
the end of this video would of been hady tip 15 years ago
The mum look … I’ve got that down and my children know that’s scarier than me shouting 🤣
‘The kid’s going super saiyan just standing on the table like AAAAAAWWWRRRRGGHHHHAAAAAA’ I can’t 😂
The dogs eyes 👁👄👁
daz i love your vids
PLEASE WATCH MORGZ
Petition to give Gizmo a little Tea time collar 📋🖊️.

That's a South African mom if I've ever heard one daz
Thought this was gonna be funny when I read the title and I was right 😂
hi
My 3 year old sister swear’s
Daz can we not make this sex ed
I saw you on that game show, the wall
my mom would always tell me if i wasn't good she would get me a super nanny
About fuckin time😂
Give them to my mom for a day
I bit my sister too and my dad bit me back and I never did that again 👏👏👏
My love language is play fighting and being jokingly rude but I know when I can’t or can
That is a terrifying expression because I had the exact same experience
Daz gives really good advices!!
AHH I was wondering when he would react to this 👍🏻👍🏻
I USED TO WATCH SUPER NANNY ALL THE TIME!!!!!!
I’m loving life sat here in my tea party t shirt from my amazing gf 😘 WITH MY TEAAA  AND WATCHING DAZZZ
If I ever spoke to my mum how that little boy did, I would be kicked across the living room and would never be let out of my room again.
Daz; 8:02  Me:Miss Trunchbull(from Matilda)
daz are you gonna play the new outlast coming out next year?
I bloody luuuuuvvvvvvvv yourrrr doooggggg I LOVEE YOU GIZZZMMMOOOOOII
I have what’s called the 👋 slap
Daz! Maybe do a Supper Nanny Skit?? That would be absolutely hilarious!!! Also thank you for putting the PSA out there about being there for the kid. It really is important
Has daz been playing any horror games laterly ?
3 HOURS AGO !
Feel bad for the girl who keeps away she had to teach herself how to behave and mature that much quicker her childhood is probably gone it’s sad and super nanny makes it worse :/
Do more supernanny stuff I loved this so much
8:44 I remember when he told us this story :)
13:48 I egree but it's not ok that that women can choose if they keep the baby or not but man can't
“Pull my hair back and put me in blue”  Daz 2021
I've showed my family daz now everyone in my family watches him
I’m a single mom of 3 kids all under the age of 6. They can definitely be a handful at times but I’m so glad they aren’t this extreme  lol
when i was younger my dad used to say if u stick your tongue out i’ll put hot sauce on it and i did it a few times and then he said u wanna try this ? and i was like why not and i ate 3 drops of ghost chillie hot sauce needless to say i don’t stick my tongue out 😂
Daz, 2 things  1. I actually saw Super Nanny filming an episode outside Tesco once, i used to be OBSESSED with the show. I was only a kid so i really wanted to run up and hug her, but my mum told me they are filming currently so i couldn't! That is wild to see though, randomly in public!  2. Your story of biting. I once knew someone who said she was friends with someone, and one day this friends daughter went up to the cat and pulled its tail really hard. So the mum then went up to her daughter, in front of the person i knew, grabbed her daughters ponytail and yanked it hard. Then all she said was "Now you know how it feels", she never did it again. But then super personally for you, that person i knew, her son once went up and bit someone, this person, his own mother, then went and bit him back. Like you, he never bit someone again
cute dog/puppy
Oh gosh, I used to watch this as a kid. Nostalgia. Like to get a barrel of bitch begone spray and selling saws for a limited time only. (This is called stonks)  🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🛢🪚🪚🪚
I wanna see Daz watch Horders
0:18 yes we all water our dogs
Daz: "There's nothing more scary than a stern mum"  Me: "Even Satan himself is scared of his mum"
If my child acts like this u would slap the sense back in them
Err daz your lip
Zero discipline.
I NEED A DAZ BLACK SKIT ABOUT THIS IMMEDIATELY!
I’ve always wanted you to watch this
Daz’s recollection of mocking and flicking off his mom had me DYING💀😂
I didn't bring tea but I have chocolate milk
i have a dog of the same breed with the same name😂 love you daz
wait until he finds amarican super nanny
Your videos are never long enough! I want an hour with Daz lol
My Mom did the whole biting thing when I bit her as a little girl and you bet I never bit anyone again!
These kids are fucked up  Kid:ShUT Up fuCKeR Mom: noooo!  Also mom: sad
Your should react to Rebeca zamolo and also your dog gizmo is so cute and looks bigger than last time you showed him 🥰😍
Daz: “and uhm- lets get into the video” my yt: *gets ad* 😭
I have the same headphones as daz
I had this paused whilst going to do something came back and unpaused, Daz just screamed “BIRTH CONTROL!!”, scared the life out of me 😂😂
Proud dog dad! The most wholesome content 😍😍
*People's of da world*  Either try limit the amount of children to 1.  Or don't have children, you'd live a much better life with you in control of yourself. And you'd do the future generations a big favour. In other words, help prevent overpopulation, as it would result in food crisis etc...
Part two please Daz x
well my mam has to deal with the same stuff except we dont beat the shit out of her pls reply i love you your the best youtuber im glad we have people like you so so so funny and kind
Nah if I did that to my parents, there would be a leather belt melting on my a$$, same for in public, there's a bathroom in stores we visit, if I act up we visit and get my a$$ beaten by leather belt and I learned from it and better person and treat everyone with respect
Everyone tell Daz to each ! had man
Choke hold *engaged* 😂😂😂
Hello Daz.
Dad has watered the dog lol
Daz talking about mums being angry  Me: trying not to laugh because it’s midnight and don’t want my parents to hear me and my mum do that to me
Asian parents:- where’s my slippers  *slipper comes flying, headshot*
Wholesome Content has to be merch
Would you not just karate chop the kid to the back of the neck and try again
I honestly don’t know how daz is still single he is a lovely bloke with an amazing personality that will make you laugh for hours on end hope you find that special someone soon daz much love
If I was that mum if my kid started hitting me I would turn into ray mysterio 😂 😂
The funniest thing happened the other day my brother called my mom and then he sat the not saying anything for a good 10 seconds and then stuck his middle finger up 😂😂😂
Yes, where IS the dad? Probably another deadbeat. I appreciate your Ted talk. Thank you.
We need more gizmo
LINED UP LIKE NAZIS PLSSS IM WHEEZING
This could make a great new daz black video daz supper nanny
Sine the kids for boxing
Omg finally I have been waiting for this for years yay!!!!
Daz the funny thing is I actually did do the dirty with my girl not to long ago and now that you mention it Ill never leave her if she gets pregnant thanks daz
Do you know by any chance when part 2 of the banned game is coming ? Or am I better off going to another channel to see the ending.
Can we all agree that when He uploads our days get better! 💖
Those children conditions are damn horrible ! How are they now? Will they be better or worse? Or, is it out of cure?
9:20 100%
I once got a sutificut for being the messeist
"ive watered you", plant? or dog?
Daz this is a command you need to watch “untitled footage of a bear”   It’s a horror short film
0:36 for anyone who is sad ^_^
i want Daz to watch the American version too
If I'd be that mother the kids are getting a slap At one point you just have to hit them
I made tea just to watch this video #teaparty #britan🇬🇧
9:03 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 😆 HAHAHAHAHA!!!! Omggggg.
O shit this is  new vid early mother cluckers
We all love daz
0:12 there are no thoughts behind those eyes lol
Omg me and mom with the silent stare. Me:😇 My mom:🥰🤱🏼 Me:😝😈 My mom:😒💢 Me:👁👁🧹😅
Might as well call this video learning with daz
When a cute puppy is in sight, it is law to leave a like
“I know I can’t leave them because they’re my children and I love them.” What a goddess. She’s a wonderful mum.
Gizmo is so adorable 🥺
My mom would've uppercutted me
I don't have tea but I have coffee Don't ask why I have coffee at 4:11pm
young kids don’t understand empathy as well as they do when they’re older, they have to be taught how their actions affect other people.
I love this video and daz telling men to be responsible is just so good to hear
We had the naughty chair and what I did was move the chair with me on it therefore not getting off the chair but still moving
"There's nothing more scary than a stern, silent mom" sent a chill down my spine
FINALLY I HAVE WANTED THIS SO BADDDDD!!! THANKS DAZZZZ
That dog is soooo cute omfg.
I think it's just when there is siblings I don't want siblings (never got one thankfully)and I was never like this aha
YOUR RUDE  I just died
I love super nanny
Looking at Daz' background and seeing everything on his walls.. pinned..uhuh :P
Reason 4 why I dont want kids
One good slap would sort en out
Daz you should react to ' Johnny johnny yes papa' 😂
You make.me giggle so much xx
Having kids to get housing used to happen, but it doesn't work any more. They stopped that years ago. You're likely to just end up in a hostel for long periods.
Daz: your trying to steal my followers I can see it in your eyes.                              Me: well his eyes are not even looking at the camera- but he has my vote on president
I love how you gave a speech for people to stay even if the child was an accident 🥺❤️
God I wish my dad even paid child support
idea what if  hear me out  what if daz became the super nanny
Daz- “Michael myers” Me- turns my head to look at my Michael myers mask that just happens to me right next to me
''when i was a kid they gave me a certificate for my ShInY sHoEs!'' best story ever
What da dog doin?
I loved watching Supernanny when my boy was young, he was my 1st, I was  a young single mum and he had behavioral problems because of his Autism, and she had some great tips and tricks that worked for us 🙂
10:15 is that child saying the f slur- who tf did he get that from if she hasnt said those swears infront of him
What breed of dog is gismo
Poor women i feel her pain its hard p😪
As I kid I was a really picky eater for reasons. So my mom would tell me I get what I'm given and I could eat it or starve.
Gizmo looks like his name is Otis.
Lol
Gizmo is so cute!!!!! I want to hug him!!!
this video is a reason why i’m happy that i’m gay
Omg! Im gonna love this video, I know it :D  Edit: I loved the video, like always.  And Gizmo :) (apologies if I spelled his name wrong)
Okay let's just look at the last two minutes of the video, daz really says the right things here, he truly is educating men of all ages and spreading a positive message about how hard single mums work, let's just congratulate daz, the single mums and the dads that are there for their kids, your all doing amazing!
“My god, these kids are SATAN!” Couldn’t have said it better
DAZ I HAVE THE SAME DOG AS YOU AND WE HAVE THE SAME BIRTHDAY WHAT-
Can you please do a part2 please
Dog
as soon as the child is caught , to the bedroom and make him watch his games be cut up in half.
Yesss hey
I been waiting for this for years
i just watched the donal glover stand up and there is an entire bit about children being mini hitlers and this video is exactly like that lmao
9:00 HOW ARE YOU STILL ALIVE
No tea:( only ramlösa
the cutest intro omg
FINALLLLY HERE I’ve searched all over YouTube  for this!
“You want my following...I can see it in your eyes” Giz: 👁👄👁
Daz and his dog at the start were absolutely adorable
You have a iggy dog 😄
It’s not always the kids fault like some are adopted and don’t know how to cope or older children having to be parents (I know from first hand experience of being the 3rd parent) with parents who have over dramatic consequences, there was this one where a dad has spanked his autistic son for crying and being over stimulated (do not do this it doesn’t help anyone) but some kids like these kids just need a good smack on the hand or the leg to understand that they can’t do this
I feel bad for the mom and eldest kid, hopefully things improved in that house. Though if that little boy had a dad like mine and slammed the door on him, that kid would have another thing coming for him from a veteran dad.  I still remember when I was little, I was so annoyed with the vacuum cleaner making all the noise, so I piled so many things at my door to try and muffle the sound. It sort of worked, but when my dad was trying to get my attention I couldn't hear him. Then he tried opening the door, I still couldn't hear him, then the next thing I knew all my shit by the door flew. He kicked that bitch open and I thought I was gonna die in that moment
"AAAAAAAAAH HES BITING"
Ok so my mom now knows that she needs to end the argument before I actually get mad cause I can argue for a long time
e
These children should have grown up in the Caribbean 😳
They really do give rewards for anything these days. I actually got a certificate for wearing a skirt once
If I would have ever dared to hit my mom, I'd be in me grave.
Daz every 3 seconds: When I grew up
Daz should watch what would your kid do 😂
omg gizmo grew so much! <3
When they were walking by the bridge I would’ve threw the kid
If I was this kid I would have been on punishment for ever and I would have got beat with the belt till I was black and blue
Funny enough when I was a child, I would bite my younger sister. My mom tried everything to get me to stop but I didn’t. And then one day, I bit my sister hard enough to make her bleed. My mom had enough of it and she bit me. You know not really hard but enough. And I stopped😂 that’s hilarious how we both did that as kids
NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE CUTEST DOG
Only ogs will know that Daz told the mum flip off story before
The mom look so true
Gizmo and daz together are indeed wholesome content
Clearly that child is lying, he is hungry…he wants to eat human.
i swear if i was there big brother they will never have a fucking attitude again
Part 2
OH MY FUCKING GODD IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SHIT 😭❤❤
More of gizz please
If I ever did that to my mom I'd would not be here to tell the tale...My mom would drop kick me across the universe and she definitely had that look she gave you knew you're in trouble.
Yeah...my mother would have beaten me like an indian drum... :D :D . It is what it is, those kids need a beating stick and them boot camp.
Thank you Daz, but I wouldn't be able to get my gf pregnant even if I wanted to- much love <3
Two weeks I would ha e it out the fucking window
He's got a dog now? 😲
The ending actually made me tear up...she does seem like a good mom, but obviously something went wrong with her parenting at a point of time. I also feel for the middle child, she's basically stuck in that hellhole. I hope she eventually gets the love and attention that she deserves.
Dog so cute
"She'd shout, she'd call me names-" *ad comes on*  Man speaking: *Hello, my flappy little friend. I love you. Just egg.*
Did he say lonely SINGLE man I thought he was married?
Guilt is a feeling that never goes away. No matter how hard you try to hide it, it's always there. Don't do what I did, don't walk away because no matter what, that child needs you. The guilt will never leave me.
When I was young and I had fights with my siblings and I was being loud. My dad would kick me out of the house. One time my brother and me had a fight at night and so my dad threw my brother and me out of the house at like 00:00. When my dad found me screaming I pissed my Pants quiet literally haha
Needed this I've had a horrible day so this made me laugh a bit thanks for cheerin es up daz 💙
Gizmos is so cute!💕
Daz owns iggy
Daz:some kids are just impossible  Me:my fucking cousin
put him up for adoption
Me when kids freak out: Sorry, we did an exorcism recently and not all the demons were released.
get the holy water
Hey everyone
Who the crack disliked this
pls watch more strange addictions
"look at joe just standing in the corner, like a curtain" 😭😭😭
PLEASE REACT TO KIM OF QUEENS PREACHERS DAUGHTER
As a spanish person... I don't get how those kids didn't get beat or at least scream at and throw into their room... like why is the mother just consenting it?
Nobody:  Nobody in this comment section:  Nobody on this earth:  Nobody on the moon:  Nobody on mars:  Nobody in the Milky Way:  Nobody in the whole universe:  Nobody in the bathroom:  Daz:
Daz tip of the day  Bite him
I can remember when I was a kid watching super nanny and nanny 911, I even showed my mom it and told her I was a good kid I could of been bad like those kids... I still remember the look she gave me and that she told me she would beat me twice fold if I tried anything those kids do
If I did 1/4 of what these kids did towards my mom, I would not be alive to regret the decision.
that dog is cute but super ugly aswell lol
Steve Wilko next?
My name is reece... I'm not that bad
dont know why the parents just turn round and bitch slap them
Wait soso and fax broke up?
I’m just gassed that u said my name, but he’s a boy and I’m a girl it’s spelt different lol😝💜
Love you daz❤️😍
These videos makes my days :)
Do you like Michael Myers?
Hola love ur vids 💖
Gizmo and Daz make my day
when we were bad my mom made us watch super nanny.
I'm so thankful I've never been caught flipping someone off 😹 It's honestly what gets me through the irritating social interactions in life. I was taught to always be the bigger person when someone is being a jerk.  *back's turned*  "F*ckin' Reagan 😤 texting me in the middle of the night after I've gone to bed and not even apologizing. I SAID not to message me past ten o'clock."  *turns around*  "Hey, Reagan 😄 How are things looking with your side of the project? I understand you were having some trouble last night?"
Daz back at it again making my college experience that much better!
In fact i do have my tea Daz cant truly enjoy your videos in full without tea
Way off topic but are you going to play Life Is Strange True Colors?? I’d love to see that </3
she’s just screaming at them, she didn’t make any moves to enforce positive reinforcement. if she doesn’t believe in spanking her children, she can still discipline them without doing all that. there’s a lot of options. she’s just screaming, and yelling at them directly in their face. nobody, not even a dog, can learn anything with someone screaming at them like that. i mean, where did this 4 year old even learn that kind of language. it doesn’t look like he’s been to any school yet, so i’m assuming he’s not learning it from the kids at school, and even then, i don’t believe that all the kids in England are just swearing up and down at 4 years old in a pre school. like what the hell is going on in this house?
Hi daz
I grew up in an immigrant house hold, and although to this day I don't support hitting your kids when there's a better solution to the problem I personally think if it got this bad I'd smack the shit out of my children.
OMG I LOVEEE THAT DOGGOOOOOOOOOOO Love u video’s ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥keep going
you told us that story about you flipping your mom off LMAOO
YES THIS VIDEO IS FINALLY HERE. WE NEED MORE OF THIS LMAO
0:54 I honestly thought he was gonna say pulling out early
This is gizmos channel now .-.
Anyone else had a naughty step?
Daz: "I've got my tea, I hope you've got yours."  Me with my bowl of mashed potatoes: "... Well, not quite."
When my mom would put me in time out I’d literally just zone out and sit there and she’d have to tell me it’s over every time XDDD
Gizmo looking cute today 😊💖
i actually didnt grow up with an father- soooo..i never knew him;-
DOGGO
Cute dog ❤️☺️👍
Feel for the mum tbh. I'm a single parent to two beautiful amazing boys. My eldest is 7 and autistic my youngest is 11 months and boy I am STRESSED. But she's right, you love them so you keep going. I feel like I wake up get shouted at by a 7 year old and beaten by a baby then go to work and come home to more of the same and it feels never ending. But I choose to have these boys and I will look after them to the best of my ability. Even on the worst days when it feels like the world's against me because I love them and that's what I signed up for.
Omg your puppy is just the cutest.  He's like just let me have this moment plz. Lol
i got a certificate once.... for turning up to course hungover
Ok but can u react to the whole vid lol
My man’s dog is called gizmo
Is that nick frost speaking
Look for the Full Episodes. The Channel thats on tv is here on Youtube
More Gizmo face time, Please!!!  Love all your videos!! *Sips on my tea* 🍵☕
My old dog was names gizmo :)
Daz and his dog 🤍🥺
I’ve had a really bad day today and this has made it a bit better
when my mum put me on the naughty spot, she legit just let me go to my room once i had 'thought about my actions'
i dont have my T but i have my morning coffee
That dog is so cute the moment I saw it I fell in love with it good job daz
WHY TF R U SINGLE! UR HILARIOUS I SAY THE WAY TO A WOMANS HEART IS LAUGHTER 🤣🤣🤣
YES DAZ FINALLY WATCHES SUPER NANNY
Oh my gosh! Joe Frost has so much nostalgia for me. Glad you reacted to their channel.
Daz talking about how there's always a possibility of pregnancy no matter the protection honestly made me happy. I have that view and a lot of people would get maad at me for it. I'm not against abortion, everyone's situation is different and I can't talk about a situation I haven't been in. But I think people forget that at the end of the day sex is for making a human. So people should take more responsibility and always keep that in mind.
PLEASE MAKE THIS A RECURRING SERIES LIKE THE PAEGENTS
plz do another one of these
You are just the king tho and anyone who disagrees needs to go to the hospital for a brain scan!!
Where's ark
Daz your dog is so cute !
HEY ITS MY DOGS DOPPELGANGER
I SAW THE TITLE AND I ALREADY KNEW THIS WAS GONNA BE GOOD
Pls Watch part 2 of supernanny :(
The boy could be autistic i was violent when i was younger and i had autism
The dog is the cutest dog ever
His dogs eyes I feel so bad for it
Pull the belt out and wear there tails out
yess
Americans have the same issue of having a bunch of kids to get assistance. Both places can relate lmao.
I have suggested this so many times I have been waiting for this for so long Yay 😊
He’s grown up so fast 🥺         The dog….I mean  Sorry daz
Sometimes you have to hit the kids thats how i learned. Obviously dont make them bleed. Just make it hurt enough so that he or she dosent act like tjis again. And when they are mature enough to understand, explain why you did it and say sorry. Tell them you did that because you love them not because you wanted to hit them.   Thats how i learned my dad beat my ass  when i was little every time i disrespected him or even tried to touch him and he cryed every time after he did it, after he explained everything i understood him as a father and never stoped loving him and this is me now. Punishing your child is not abuse. Its abuse when you do it out of anger or when you go overboard and never explain why you did it or even worse taking pleasure of of hitting your child. THAT IS ABUSE.
I have hot chocolate acctually and daz. I'm frome the UK too lol
I love these videos so much😂😂😂😂😂
My mom never gave me that look
The day has finally come…
You should also try an episode of worlds strictest parents
We need more of these please, Daz! Also, Gizmo is the cutest 🥺❤️
Who else say DAZ GAMEZ and DAZ WATCHES with him? 😂
Ah yes, children, or as i like to call them: Tiny Hitlers
Aww gizmos big eyes tho!?
DOG
👏👏👏👏
Hearing this daz sounds like a good dad
i wanted to see you react to the whole videooooooo love u daz
Just Wait for the cameras  to turn off off 🥲😂
I love that we have more daz watches now
If I did that my mom would’ve let me starve😂
I'm not going to lie, daz is now irrelevant. I'm now a Gizmo fan,  Gizmo watches!! 😂😂
I've seen the full episode and the kids do get sorted out thanks to the naughty step, new schedule and etc, she arranged the Mum spending proper quality time with the good girl that didn't get attention before. You should definitely do a part 2, I reccomend this: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdV-IQLfXl1pijwyOZgtWjHl3U_7x786R
My mother  would  beat the hell out of me
what daz said at the end was so good of him!!!
I too,  I’m that lonely single guy with a dog
After watching this show I invested in a dungeon, some cages and chains  .JK.
Even my dad used to start tidying up when i got the mum look
The two greatest tools a parent has - The Look and The Voice.
you watered YOUR DOG!!!  HE'S NOT A PLANT ... wait ... is he?
Asian don't have this kind of programs because parent beat yo ass if u behave live that
I just realized he told us the Middle Finger story on the “Daz Reacts to Crazy Mums” video. He said he was on his drum set.
YOR ROOD
my mom put me on the steps once and i fell asleep. many times and mom stopped putting me on the steps
Trying to beating your mother in Africa 😐😐. Your neighborhood come to save you.
Can't believe your dog has the same name as my cat. Great minds and all that
this is the fakest thing because for one the little kid is being an absalout little shit especialy when the nanny is stood there and also they got like 8 scenes where the kid is being chaotic and for 3 ..what is this cry??? no one cry's like this 11:57  lol.. oh yeah also the girls are a lot bratty and they're 7- 8 wtf no 8 or 7 year old acts like that.well. atleast  i know i diddnt
If I ever did get a woman pregnant and I wasn’t ready to be a father, well fuck it I may not wanna be with the mother relationship wise but I could never let one of my children out there without me caring for them. It wouldn’t feel right.
I have the same dog, that looks exactly the same-
I love Daz sm look at him and the DOG SO CUTE
Please do more of this, I love watching super nanny and would love to see your reactions to her way of discipline
I’ve been binge watching Super Nanny for the last 2-3 months! I never expected this to be a Daz watches. I am soooo happy!!!
Daz uploading on birthday is a blessing ✨✨
Hey daz I don’t usually comment on anything but I just want to say that I love your videos I can’t say it enough you literally make my day with all your content again can’t say it enough but you are amazing and Just keep doing what you’re doing and thank you for making amazing content
2:02  Leaving this here for you all.
Y’all realize this show is more about bad parents right
I don't know if this happens in the UK but do perants smack theirs kids cause In Australia we do if they act like that
8:22 8:33 8:38 8:54 9:03 9:15 10:00
Anyone remember that supersize vs super skinny program? 😅
'Pull her hair back so tight that the scalp is barely holding on .' 😂😂
About the 4-year-old swearing. Where did this kid hear these words from? Cuz from a personal experience i started swearing a lot (not at other people but for example when i drop smth) because i heard my parents say these words very and i mean very often. They literally greet each other with swears sometimes lol so i just naturally picked it up. Might not be the case for him tho can't be sure
Listen when I tell you I ran to grab my headphones and clicked so fast 😂😅
the mom look LMAO
I love your videos daz you make me laugh smile and happy everytime you make a video never stop uploading plz I've been watching your vids for years now and none of them are boring god bless you and stay safe😁❤
After watching this, my womb sewed itself shut.  Also, if a kid did any of that shit to me, I would drop kick them into oblivion.
hi im new here and i just sub
ogs will remember the story ab daz putting up his middle finger at his mom lmao
Omg super Nanny was my favourite thing to watch
thank you so much Daz for making me laugh when I am stressed. your vidoes are what people need in life. and they make life enjoyable. once again thank you for making me happy.
0:06 All I heard in my head was Dad I just want to be a star like you!     Let me be a star Dad!
👍
I need part 2 😂
"Oh ok thats what you will be having then, you will also be getting *MY BOOT* "  Killed me x-x
wait 2 hrs ago jesus i’m low key early only this late bc i was in school
I think your dog is soo cute 🥰
I love daz’s dog tho
i think i've blocked "The Mum Stare" from my memory to be honest
The dog is so cute and love watching your videos daz
Im sorry daz but this is the first time i couldn't finish a video those kids where pissing me of ❤ much love bro
Sarah watching 6:10 🤔
Do a second part but with the USA it’s full episodes and more happens
This might make me get back into my SuperNanny phase
Daz talking about how you should not leave a kid and you gf  people: who did and are listening to him😐😐😐
Gizmo=King
use me as a "here within 3 hours" button
Omg yessss this is gonna be so good I can already tell 😂
When I watch Super nanny I get so pissed of at the things the kid does, When it goes to daz and he roasts him I get so happy
I've never wanted kids in the first place 😂
LMAO this was so funny
@daz games super nanny first does i bit to see what happening then she does the fixing
I would get beat with a belt so fast if I acted like that
q
you should watch dr.pimple popper
Carnage when he bites Eddie be like
“I’ve watered you,”   *Daz, you water your dogs…?*
Nice dog
GOZYMO
Where is the dad
When you spank your child for hitting it teaches 2 things. When you hit someone they will hit back. And when you hit someone there are consequences for your actions. I'd rather hit my child with control to not really hurt them than for them to be out and about and hit someone and get knocked out by someone else.
This hit hard, I'm that mum with my 3 😪 totally broken 😔
2:06 COUNCIL ESTATE VERSION OF MRS DOUBTFIRE HAHAHAHH
Great speech at the end
Supernanny Daz skit
*ˢᵗᵃʳᵉˢ ⁱⁿ ᵇⁱˢᵉˣᵘᵃˡ*
People who haven’t seen the dark side of your child: Aw! Your kid is like an angel!”  The suffering mom:(whispers) so was satan
Is your dog ok? His right eye is kind of red
No one: Gizmo: 🌒^🌘
You should watch American Super Nanny next. xD
2:30 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Gizmo is so cute 🥰
See sometimes it’s ok to hit ur kids…….this is one of those times
I once hit my mom and she hit me back and I never hit anyone ever again.
Live you Daz but I love how irritated you are with Jo, just seeing her 🤣. If anyone wants to pass you off they just need to show you supper nanny and they will get angry daz noises
Lol did that kid really just said the f word 😳😳😳
daz would be the sexiest nanny am i right or am i right?😂
AHHHH cutie lil dog lol the name gizmo reminds me of  the leader of the HIVES in teen titans
He watered his dog ????🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Super nanny was one of the many shows that put me off having kids when I was a teen. My mum would say "Aw, I used to think like you, don't worry. You'll change your mind at 24 like I did after meeting your father." I'm now 25 and still don't want kids, nothing has changed, mum. 😂
Ps. Love your vids😁
THE 4 YEAR OLD SAID KIZ MA WILLY LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL I CANT BREATHEEEEEE XDDDDDDDD
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
Yesssss I’ve been wanting this
Gizmo is a little cutie
oh god! if i cussed like that little boy, my mom wouldve smacked me so hard on the mouth in public i would've had a red mark
The Wise old Daz have spoken
And here I was thinking that there was no such thing as a bad Reece. So sad
5:07
I felt depressed then I opened YouTube and saw you uploaded a video and it just made my day. I absolutely love your content
Dude I’ve been wanting this video since 2016
Daz is just so understanding and amazing we should all inspire to be him
The bitting thing yes that's what my dad did! However I didn't bite my Dad the dog did and hurt dad so he bit the dog... Dog learned his lesson.
4:00
WHERE IS KAYS COOKING T-shirt ??? 😂 😂 😂 😂
Day 2 of asking Daz to play Tall Poppy😁
My new dream is to see DAZ  dressed like supernanny 😂🤣😂
THE DAY HAD COME HE HAS REACTED
4 year old: FUCK OFF BASTERD  me: did the four year old really just say that??!!
You guys look alike!!
This vid got to me a little at the end bc my father left when my mother was pregnant and I haven't seen him yet
SINGLE? WHAT ABT LINDAAA
I would go to jail because i would beat they a$$
OMG, this show!!👀 None of the kids, from any of the seasons, could be mine!!  And, I'm also a lonely soul with a dog😂
You're not wrong about that mom look. It scarier somehow with my mom, since she had almond eyes and she had to widen them. I don't know why it scared me so much but, it did. My 3rd grade teacher even did that to me, and when she did that I would just stop messing around in class and just do my work.
Cute puppy!!! 😍😍
Loved you on the wheel
I watched this show every day when I was a kid and thought it was the best show so seeing Daz react to this is so fucking awesome hahaha
If I was her I’d end up turning around and slapping them back
My kitten is the same colour and has the same name
Did not expect to see a daz watches about super nanny lmao
That dog- is absolutely named Gizmo. That dog is such a Gizmo.
how does this happen, what are the parents doing for a child to end up like this, am i the only person with an egyptian mom who knows the secret martial arts of the belt?
We need a body slam squad to stop naughty children.
Daz makes this so wholesome but id honestly just throw them into a wall if i was their parent and they did that to me
I'm 15 but when I would try something like this when I was a child i would get fucking punched in the face.
No more daz games... It s now giz games 🤣🤣🤣
10:01 das eyes go 🌒~🌘
I like how he didn’t show the nanny doing anything
I bit my sister and my mum bit me too
Gizmo just looks tierd
Daz taking that moment to address men and young boys to tell them that message - it's amazing. Daz, you are a wonderful male role model. I love how you strike down the whole 'be a man' statement and you embrace just being a human being. I love you, Daz! Keep being such an awesome person! <3
Daz and gizmo are so cute when they cuddled
Part 2? 😳
Awwwwwwwwww
That is the cutest dog ever
1.9k in 2 hours
I'm not first, but I'm 70, 174th
My sister once bit me on my leg because I was standing on a shoe she wanted. It left a purple mark :D
If I cussed at my mom, I would die. If I do much as say damn, I would get murdered
the look is pain
been waiting for thjs
I don't know about ya'all but if my child slapped me they would get slapped into shock, I'd say "don't ever do that again" in a calm and low voice and walk away.
I don't use a naughty spot, I put my children in a room with nothing, they stay there a minute a year old they are (1 year old one minute) ( 2 year old 2 minute)
1 hour ago I think this is the earliest I’ve ever been to one of ur videos 😭
Me: i've been crying for a moment because i saw something i shouldn't have seen about Daz in joujo.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor girlfriend
Sometimes it's alright to commit children tackle or a body slam. Chain them up and torture them. Tomorrow I'm also committing a mass homicide.
I don’t have tea but does boiled bean juice count???? ☺️
more of this! and more gizmo :)
My cat is black and white and he is called gizmo
OMFG finally
at 7:15 was she going to say fuck
OmG yAs~ i've been waiting for a notification! I 'm early-ish too.Love your vids btw <3
Supper nanny needs to meet BILLY
MY DOGS CALLED GIZMO TOO!!
I really wanna see more pictures of my strange addictions lol
Wait what happened to u and ur partner
OMG I WAS HIS DOG
What happened with the good ol belt!? Beat some sense in all of them xD
My mum had a nauty step and we were there for the same amount of minutes as our age there
Awwwww we need to find daz a lovely lady dazzlers
Who else has been waiting for this?
My dad used to tie a rope to my bedroom door handle and then to the banister to lock me in my room that was my naughty spot.
cant you just beat your kids?
can you watch world strictest parents next
‘Pull my hair back and put me in blue!’ Pretty specific kink but whatever floats your boat :/
What’s giz short for??
posting on my birthday? YAAASS OMGGGG
"she got them all lined up...like little nazis" i swear this man can say the most random things and still somehow make me fall of my chair laughing
Dude I’m not saying hit you kids but if I kids did this OOOOOH NELLIE THERE IM FOR A TREAT
Why she don’t spank he. she so dum
Yo Daz I love your mug, where did you get that mug from!?
heyp
I`ve watched supernanny alot of times in the past. Alot of the times she is to very good help, and sometimes, not so much…  But as a youth- and child worker and studying to be a preschool teacher these are so sad to watch. Specialy the kids. And what happend for it to get this bad?…  Somethings that we learn when studying to be a preschool teacher, is that kids are not born hateful/ rageful unless something has happend to the child or it`s not developed right.. in some way it`s always a reason why kids behave the way they do.   And something that I`ve learned from family, friends and colleags is that rage breeds rage/ anger breeds rage/ anger, and actuallyyou can say that about everything. Even positive thing, kindness breeds kindness etc.   Anyways, it’s NOT fun at all to be in that kind of situation, regardless of what the reason for how it got so bad. I hope she got the help she needed.  I see alot of times in other countrys than Norway, that the look on kids, their behavior, Punishment or solutions and other things relevant to that, is often different from what I’m use to in Norway. Interesting how we all have different looks/ perspektiv/ theories on things. Even if something is purely resesrch-based.    Ps. Lots of hugs and love from Norway❤️ Love your channel!  Your videos make me help reflect on thing and your videos also make me laugh so hard! (Not necessarily the same videos) 😹 Stay Dazzling ❤️
nice
Moking that what i do
5 mins in and I'm pissing myself I shoudnt but phhhff omg
Daz would make an awesome super nanny!! I really hope he does more of these videos 😊
so how to not be lonely get a dog
0:41 Omg I literally just got a depo shot yesterday 🤣 wtf this ain't a coincidence
“She’s got them all lined up….” Me: oh like the Vontrap family cute Dad: like little Nazis Right okay 😂
She’s actually really great at her job lol u should do more
I'm dead lil dude said "kiss my willy"
Ah Supernanny, the threat my mother always used to make us behave
Daz and the dog look the same
Dog *dog* DOG *DOG* *DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG*       Yeah I like dogs, and that was one cute pup. *Show us more, we need more!*
Get the belt and give a spanking
I saw cute dog and I arrived here
*like little nazis*  Daz 2021
I've watched dez for three years and I've somehow never knew he had a dog
I think daz told us about the flipping of his mum before
Bro if I were to hit my mum, ooooooooohhhhh shit. My jaw will be relocated
Watching this before I head to work 😊
OMG MY DOGS CALLED GIZMO TOO AND HE IS ALSO DERPY
too funny omg
One certificate i got was "taller than my teacher" and you know, if that happened now I'd just go and make a "shortest teacher" or "shorter than my student" award. Honestly quite offended me cause like everyone else got one to do with talent or intellect and i got this lameass reward about being tall. Like bitch i had no choice in that- maybeeee you shouldn't be so DAMN SHORT! Honestly didnt help with self confidence either, as someone with depression who's been bullied the whole of their school life. Was gr8 😤 I still dont have much confidence in any talent or intellect i May have. And that kids is a 🌟self fulfilling prophecy 🌟
Dad the king of youtube
u should totally do mor of these bids man
Do mooorrreee
Damn I literally just finished my tea!!
My dad use to handcuff me and my brother together (he was a military dad) when we use to get physical. We were homeschooled so we were at home together 24/7 and we got physical a lot. He also had us run laps in the winter with snow suits on. I feel like parenting has changed a lot over time, for good and bad. My dad was huge in corporal punishment (I am not) and he threatened us a lot with the belt which I think is very non-effective for kids.
Awww we didn't get to see Supernanny lay down the law 😢
SO DAMN CUUUUTE
you know to cut the shit when your mom starts counting to 3-
Same  When I was little I bit someone so my mum bit me
Xxxtentacion. Look at me!
All they need is a Caribbean mom to take care of them for a month they will be a change person😂
is that nick frost narrating lol
Petition for daz reacts to weird stock photos
me yelling smack him
This better become a series like toddl3rs and tiaras
The naughty spot worked for me. And sometimes when I was bad I ended up on the naughty step for an hour, and I would always fall asleep💀✨💔
That boy is the next mike Tyson
Cutest dog ever
My friend was on super nanny, I’m not going to say their name because idk if they want to be mentioned, anyway! So my friend said super nanny literally didn’t do anything they just grew up 😂 soooo she’s not really super nanny
i was eating a Reeses peanut putter cup and i heard her name was reece or something 😂
I think my mum would leave me on the side of the ride if I did anything like this 😀
Daz deserves an award for the last 2 mins for speaking to us boys
“There is no surface left, WHERE THERE ISN’T SOMETHING PINNED ON IT!” Also Daz’s room:
How has this video only got 62k views and have 1.8k comments...this content is very commentable
Yes if you bite someone let them bite you back
You are the funniest Daz! I currently have pneumonia, and binge watching your videos helps a lot. Thank you.
My dad is the one that does the silent look, but one difference is that he’ll look at me angrily and intently, he bits his bottom lip at the same time then he says something in Indian very angrily (my dads Indian btw). That look and lip bite combo is when I know I’ve done something VERY wrong
Kids don't get punished enough. I was beaten all the time lol. Had I hit my mom, I would've been beaten within an inch of my life. Now, I'm great lol
Daz, that video is about 15 years old. It was filmed in the UK for Supernanny uk. I remember watching it back then, and I'm pleased to let you know that Supernanny really helped this Mum and completely turned the kids' behaviour around. Those kids are actually adults now! 😊
i love watching super nanny its so funny
The world isnt ready for his last "WHATS UP DAZZLERS" just str8 fax
Personally, the NUMBER ONE way to GUARANTEE you don't become pregnant is DON'T HAVE SEX ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
Oh my fuck ur dog is actually so cute give me 🥺❤️
You kinda didn’t watch much of what she does at all, you watched the kids shout and be aggressive where was supernany clip of her dealing with the kids showing how the mum took control this was disappointing.
I didn’t know you had a dog OMG SOOO CUTE❤️💜🧡💛🤍💚💙❤️‍🔥💓💗💖💘💝💞💕❣️💟
If his dog was sitting next to you on the couch he can watch you and the TV😂
Me: i've been crying for a moment because i saw something i shouldn't have seen about Daz in joujo.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor girlfriend
I sympathise with the eldest girl, I’m the exact same
My mom used the naughty chair  and I I just go up and walk of and laugh at her 😂😂😂😂 then she stop doing it
I honestly don’t know how the mother puts up with them. I have very little patience so if my kids were doing that, they would’ve been dropped off at an orphanage already.
9:15 ......BLOODY HELL THE ACCURACY IS SCARY😭
my mom would make me kneel over rocks in one corner carrying jugs of milk lol
The mum look is iconic
I have no worries about getting a chick pregnant. I'm gay.
🕺🌚
This what happens when you treat your kids as gods and don't spank them
“I’d give her Mum of the Month before she’s dead”😭Help
That’s weird lmao I’ve been binging those videos all night 😭
OH MY GOD DAZZZZZZZZ IVE ASKED FOR THIS FOR YEARS!!!!!😭❤️
One daz uploads a video  *lesssssssssgooooooooooooo*
jojo refrence??????? iggy??????????
How did he learn swear words? Its just growing in a terrible environment that has got that 4 year old kid to be so rebellious. The environment the kid is being raised in btw isn't always the parents fault. In my case it is - As a kid (I am 17 now) I was rebellious, a part of me still is and it is cause of the fact that my parents used to beat me up a lot. On one hand they would do nice things for me (grateful for that) but going ahead and beating me up...I felt it was unacceptable and I would hit them back, at times they would also kick me out of the house. The beating up was mainly for academics which I was never bad at (I am talking 85-95% results every semester), which my parents now take credit for though they didn't do shit (kinda funny considering their academics prowess is absolutely ridiculous and the teachers who I have "learnt" from I never understood, I self study to this day not paying attention to a single class). I was also rebellious cause my parents were wrong in most cases beating me up (they still are wrong, not beating me up anymore but I'm moving out soon so I couldn't care less), that pain and anger all went back to them. Also my dad used to cuss a lot at me too, he still does. To this day I haven't cussed at anyone irl other than my parents cause I know how much pain one goes through hearing such hurtful words.  The ones who go through such pain become good parents later on in life if they know what empathy is. Not saying I will be a good parent in future but rather I would try harder and better instead of losing my patience.   I'm guessing no one ever will have enough time or could care to read this comment (cause yea I see it as a load of crap too 😂) but I wanted to share my feelings so here it is anyway.
I grew up in a west Indian family. I acted like this, I got hit. Hard.
I very much a agree with your statement that if you get a girl pregnant you need to be there to support her not only helping out financially but also but being a fatherly presence in the child's life. Though to add with my own experience, the best thing my dad could have done was leave. He was extremely abusive and unreliable. In those cases, as tough as it is to raise a kid alone sometimes it's for the best. I wish that mom the best of luck
That little boy is a demon child, if I was his mom I wouldn’t talk to that boy, I’ll feed him wash him, and that’s it🧍🏽‍♀️
Set him up for adoption problem solved
Dax always makes my day. And such a cute puppy you have!!🤗😂
9:15  I could feel the stress all over again just from that look
Me: i've been crying for a moment because i saw something i shouldn't have seen about Daz in joujo.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor girlfriend
https://youtu.be/qE0Q8XJDZCA for the sketch. I think this is the one which he refers to.
I thought he had a gf? He said he was single
why does his dog look so done with life
I would whoop their asses so hard they'd be bleeding for a week
Daz: talking about getting a woman pregnant and being as bigger person, not running off  My dad: 👀he’s onto me holy shit
Like your dog
Daz can u play ark with dave
There is something called whipping your kid and they should try it

My mum is friends with super nanny
When my brother was little, he was so angry once he threatened to break all his toys. Our mum just walked away and let him do it. Luckily, all of his toys were Legos so it was an easy fix when it was all done.

2:05 ok um LMAO thats funny as hell
i just looked at the date of the video and got so surprised that this was posted today bruh my eyebrows raised bare high
My mum did the same did they same thing daz’s mum did. I bit her, she bit me and i never bit again
daz for context i am 18, but daz i watch Super nanny all the time and I still want kids.
"Pull my hair back and put me in blue" I CAN'T😂
Aawww Daz & Giz
i wuld just put them up fore adopthion
Woah
That's the reason I don't want kids
Gizmo the boggle-eyed panda dog is amazing, also this is the content I needed after today lol
Why is no one talking about how cute daz's dog is 😞😂
So proud to be childfree ✌️
GIZMO!!!! ❤️❤️ he finally made an appearance! Double the Dazzling content! Btw, the silent mom was / is scary, or when you hear your full name! 🤣😅
Did he say kiss my willy? Omg I could never let that happen!
Bro just pull of a shoe and beat there ass
I miss this show!
Am I the only one who wants Daz to react to Dance Moms
Oh those kids need real beating and they will stop
Really want some “Tie my hair back and put me in blue” merch. Can this be a new saying?
im 14 and my schools tutor called my dad to say how amazing of a student i was... i sat there asleep in every lesson we had
You should watch some of the American ones and also America's Supernanny
I used to do the mocking thing all the time got looked at that once and I haven't done it since she didn't say anything she just gave me the look and that's was it
She might give you a naughty step in the minute with that attitude daz lol
fun fact: when i was younger (6-8) my mum and dad not only let us swear but actually taught us to swear. theres home videos of me and my siblings saying one by one the word "fuck" and giggling about it, i know its weird but i think it was good that they taught us what swearing was so that we understood and knew when to say it.
Nanny's hair looks like it's trying to snatch itself
We Balkans do NOT have this kind of problem. Our parents just smack the shit out of us and we end up crying silently. In order to apologize, they came into our room asking us if we want fruit.  And this is the end of another episode of ✨KEEPING UP WITH THE BALKANS✨  Thank u😌
Omg daz your almost at 7 mill lets gooooo
Ngl your dog looks like iggy from jojo bizzare adventures
Daz said that story about him flicking his mum off in another video a long time ago 8:42
Jamaica could never😆
How could you dislike this video?! This is great content
My uncles cat is named Gizmo
There are times when a parent has know that enough is enough you cant always get your kids to listen by just shouting back or being stern sometimes a kid has to be punished my parents punished me and my brothers we had a few options depending on what we did we argued back or electronics were taken away we took something or got in trouble we had a few more options getting spanked with a hand a wooden spoon a belt a hanger or the worst thing ive never been hit with yet the chancla which for non mexican people its like a flip flop
Derp dog
Godammit, Daz, I'm sick with a chest cold and this is NOT HELPING ME!!!! lmfao *coughwheezecough* OWWWWW
Anyone else love when he adds his past stories into videos
Gizmo is one of the cutest things I’ve seen in a long time
😂😂😂😂 I’m so ready for this.
Not Daz calling the Nanny a curtain 😭
When I was young and holding hands with parents while doing stuff with then if I fidget or get ansey or hit then they just squeeze my wrist to hurt a little and a look they shut me and my sisters up and when we were walking on ate own we better keep up or they leave us behind my sister was always at the place where kids go when there lost so many times that they knew them by name
Daz I love you
Biz is so cute and Beautiful
hey daz 👋
I miss watching Supernanny. 😔 I feel that no one can replace her. I understand why she stopped doing the show, I just wish it continued a little longer. 🙁❤️
The thumbnail is everything 😂
When are we gonna get a mum reveal
I love you daz😁
This is the vidoe I have been waiting for for soooo long 💜😂😂
The only problem is I now have enough to pay the energy bill my mum would just say you know what you pay it   Me:😳🤗 love you mum
What da dog doin
Doggy🥺
Wait, I need to watch with my dinner. Ok much better!!
Daz, u were amazing on the wheel ❤️
Remember seeing a kid screaming in the supermarket and like... nah screw that shizz. I can barely deal with myself when I'm having an emotional breakdown. Let alone a kid having a break down who can't understand their own emotions and talk about how they feel.
I wish we could see how it ended 😭
only posted an hour ago and already 1,685 comments :) <3
Daz Ia Back☺️
HII DAZZZZZ
YESSS GIZMO CONTENT
6:35 Daz just glitched😓🙏
We have been awaiting this day for so ling
Lessss goo
Daz is the most funniest person I know
Gizmo is fkn adorable
"like little nazis" perfect name for kids
That is a CUTE dog
Daz I’m fully aware of what you’re trying to say at 5:49 here and I’m very happy to hear that your daughter is much better, but I love you for the drop of Michael Myers. Hell yeah I love Halloween!
If you didn't want the food that my parents made you would have to make your own or get nothing and my dad had this look that made everyone think twice not just his own kids but others too he was my teacher for church once he made everyone quite with that look
ur dog looks like iggy from jojo very cute
I love gizmos eyes just straight up ⬅️➡️
Whenever I did anything like that as a toddler/little kid- My mom had a secret weapon.... Pressure Points.
Yaaaaas super nanny!
daz chain
God the amount of times my family pressure me into having kids because I’m the only girl 😒 yeah no thanks, my cats are enough 😹😹
✨ wholesome moment ✨
best one yet
Hilarious as always!!! Would love to see you react to other gimmicky 2000s shows like Nanny 911,  Wife Swap or the old VH1 dating shows like Flavor/Rock of Love 🤣
11:29 “kiss my willy”?????
Shorter sentences or freedom? Shorter sentences or freedom?
Seeing how these kids act, I'm always really surprised?(idk what word to use) Because if I acted that way, I would have gotten bad a** whooping 😅
Daz plz show your wife or girlfriend
Yesss ! You should do a fax black super nanny skit
Daz : why are you looking so miserable?  I have walked you I have feed you I have watered you  😂The dog isn't a plant you can't water it 😂
GIZMO!!! HES BACK:D
That is a nice puppy
First off, Daz is freaking hilarious, I love to watch these vids. Two, Im not even an adult yet (I’m almost there tho) and watching that kid hit her mom infuriates me. I’m sitting here like “I want to see that nanny put that kid in his place right now”.
Ha, wait till you meet my sister. No physicality, but a lot of mental violence
The son seems especially violent for his age, I'm guessing he learned it from his father.
He should see the American families on Super Nanny... They're absurd and so ridiculous! But I want to see his opinion on those families! 😂😂😅😅
Best intro ever-  Thank you gizmo for blessing this day/night with wholesomeness
Aww Gizmo has grown so much since I last saw him
Thank fuck I’m gay
he's definitely swearing like that cause he's heard it from his mum
Please watch Flamingo
Daz, I love your videos they cheer me up on a bad day :)
thats the second time he told that story of his mom seeing him flip her off
Thank you daz for staying a positive influence in my life seeing your videos and a couple other youtuber's videos have really helped me through the years thanks again stay dazzling HA!!!
Wen is daz gonna reaction to the 9 year old ye
I would've been beaten with a belt for do anything close to what those brats did. Hell,  I was beaten with a belt for fidgeting during my older sisters elementary school graduation
1 hour early
OOOOHH MY FUNKING GOD LOOK AT THE CUTE ASS PUPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰☺️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰☺️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰☺️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰☺️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This Is Awesome! Lol.
Daz out here giving valuable life lessons, making funny content and caring for his kid. It's just amazing, we need more people like him 🥺
Not the Super Saiyan child💀💀
That little kid wouldn’t last 1 day in a Mexican household
Loving
The fact that Cartman literally made SuperNanny go INSANE and get sent to a mental institution is absolutely hilarious. If she can't fix Cartman, then she is not able to fix every child. XD
He so cute 🥰🥺🥺 fire content daz love the videos
More pls daz game!!!! I love it and love ur dog gizmo
YESSSSS make more of these!!! and bring Huw and Dave!!!!!!
Gizmo want to be on camera like the tik tok live
😭😭 I audibly gasped at 4:07 cause I thought it was the mom who swung at the kid (how the video paused it looked like the kid fell over after the thump) and I was like 😭😭😭 the super nanny crew are fine filming that ?? But damn that boy tryna fight
I wanna see super (Daz) /nanny😂😂😂
As a single mom with no help for the last 15 years I can confirm that I am constantly on alert that I'm about to get punched in the tits.
Yoooo Daz!
If I was acting like that kicking and hitting also shouting at ny folks let's just say I would get hit with switch, stick, La Chancla, the belt, the paddle and get cursed out in Spanish  also wouldn't be able to walk right for days this is coming from a Mexican family and I turned out to be fine and I fully respect my parents and my family members.
👁️👄👁️ daz made my day funnier :)
And this is why I’m having my tubes tied lmao 🤣 I don’t want kids 😂
Awwww lil Giz!! Daz is right he's coming for your following. He's gonna have Gremlin followers.
First time im seeing a video of daz this early😂 normally i watch the videos of like 2 years old or so
Loved this reaction. Also, Daz somehow I saw a clip of yours on r/Niceguys on Reddit. Idk how you got on there. Just wanted you to know.
Daz: this is normal  Me: so a 4 years old cursing and going goku is normal
I’ve been waiting for this one 😏😏
Oh my god I love Bostons
Daz never uploads a low quality video he takes his time with every one I appreciate that
I have been waiting for this my whole life
when I was little we had the naughty step… when my brother was put on it he would sit there and cry but when I was on it…. I would just get up and leave.
Hi
The father is getting some milk
This was amazing!! I really want you to do a full video, please please please
I used to teach little kids and when they swore I just laughed in their face and it shut them down. Swearing is their grownup power move and if I mocked it then it instantly lost all its power.
At 1:26 at that point I was trying so hard to think of something annoying about Daz. But I honestly can’t think of a single thing
DOgGo DaZ
Plz do daz watches Daz funny moments
Any intro with a pup is a great intro 🐶
I was wondering why my brother named my dog gizmo now I know
Never really got this show. Had a kid who went to my school who was on it. He got really badly bullied for it. He died not so long ago, unsure if it was suicide or what but I know it made his and his familys life hell, just because someone was desperate  for help
Hi I'm here
Daz: Birth control! We all need it! Me: *stares homosexually*
when he said i hope you got your tea i went to get some
If I acted like that kid growing up me and the belt would be best friends😆
Yayyyyy I have been waiting to react to super nanny!!!
super fanny
Daz: _wholesome content_  Me: *tearing up* yes indeed
i love this vid I AM GETTING YOUR MERCH SOON
Bless you daz
I haven’t got tea but I have got coffee 😋
early!!!!!
The doggy
I BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE!
I have a funny joke ..     Dax is so fat that the only time he runs is when food is on sale  #i dont really mean your fat its just a joke  Your the best person on yt :):D:/ :^) :-)
the mother didnt even ground them i mean if i hit my mom i will get my grave ready
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!
I am 14 and i have grown up not having my dad around so seeing Daz be so passionate about being their for his daughter is rlly  sweet i wish i had a dad like him
I need more super nanny reactions because these are definitely not the worse kids I’ve seen on that show. I’m dying to see Daz’s reaction to some of the shit I’ve seen these kids do.
Daz talking about how he flipped is mother off gets me 😂😂
Daz when is the next ark video coming out
Gif god Giz is adorable,and at the same time this is a gold vid😂😂
my mom did the same thing when i bit my sister as a kid 😂😂
Can we just appreciate how cute the dog is?  He/ she (Sorry I don’t know the gender) is adorable!
Earliest I've ever been to a daz video 😆
My dig is called gizmo
I don’t believe in hitting children, but a good slap after they’ve hit first would make a huge difference.
I think I'm apart of the Daz watches Fandom, no rush or anything. But what happened to reacting to bad go fund me
Ahhh litteraly what we have all been waiting for 🤣
My aunt and uncle had the exact same dog breed except there’s was blind(poor thing) anyway you’re dog is really cute.
Super nanny is just standing there     MENACINGLY
sat down after a bath with a yumyum and a cuppa tea to watch a daz video, dream evening if you ask me
What happened to Honey?
I would have been the worst father because I would have used the shit out of my belt
The British Eric Cartman
Gizmo's mind:I want meat.
This is way I love daz games because daz always has a good way to explain everything
That what happens, when you don't spank your kids when they really need to be spanked to learn the lesson. I mean, only when talking do not work.
you should react to dance moms!
Gizmo is so beautiful🥺 and I have been waiting for this video omg I can’t wait
Like little Nazis made me laugh so hard
Okay but where’s the part where they *Beat the living daylights out of the kids* Except the nice kid. Give her a medal. And give the mum a BLOODY OSCARR!! FOR THE MOST PATIENCE IN THE WORLDD!
Dude i did the exact same thing to my mom. Literally the exact same thing
You shud do a sketch of it
Again, you can hate the kids all you want, but they're only that way because how they've been bought up.
This is why I am NOT having kids, because I would drop kick that child into space
yes it is finally here after many years the best video in the world
I want your dog.
My dog is called giz too!
If I EVER did any of these things to my parents I would get a verbal ass beating lol, and I would never do it again. These kids are insane
YAY FINNALY
Single? I thought u had a kid and a girlfriend..if she left, shes missing out on a lot,you're the nicest person ever, and you're really funny, you will find the one, i promise
we need a part two of this it’s just too good daz
I think Jo is patience and brilliant, it's sad that there are bad parents out there, otherwise this program wouldn't exist.
Daz ur not a lonely man with a dog u have LINDA.
i wanted Daz to watch the entire episode
DAZ !! Love the video . But you are so right . Being a single parent is very difficult, I am a single mother of 2 and their dads don’t want anything to do with them. 😞 and the younger generation needs to understand a lot about s3x because it’s not Said enough in school.  So thank you for acknowledging that. I appreciate you ❤️
🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙃🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙃🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙃🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂                                  🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
god that end part of daz explaining how it's wrong for men to walk out of their partner and child's lives like nothing.. I appreciate you daz <3 my dad also did the same to my mum when she was pregnant with me and it's something that no one deserves to go through.
If I ever bit my mom. She would have released my soul from from my body. Dead.  "She died an idiot" my tombstone would say.
Daz I really do look up to you for one reason and one reason only your valuable life lessons
when i was younger like 4 or 5 we had a ukulele and well i got angry at my sister and well..i smashed it on her head. I got put in the naughty corner for 2hrs..
I have been waiting for him to react to this for soo long but gizmo was so cute at the start I felt so bad for the mum and the oldest daughter 🥺
watch another one daz
HES SO CUTEEEE THE DOGGIEEEE
Hello Daz I'm quite early to this
OMG i need chering yup thanks to daz i am now
Birth control. WE ALL NEED IT. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
THIS DOG IS SO ADORABLE <3
I'd just pop em in the mouth
your dog is the same colour as my rabbit and they both have the same name, gizmo
My aunt has her kids put their noses on the wall as punishment
the nanny lowkey looks like the fairy godmother from shrek 😭
Daz she observes’ watches parent struggle then helps her in t ep 2
It's the way they start of so polite as well
Not all of the episodes are the children's fault. Some have abusive homes, or the adults force the older children to be the parent with dramatic consequences if they make the slightest mistake. I remember an episode where the father was hitting the children and cussing them out, then continued to be violent if they tried to stop him or stand up
FINALLY!!!! 2 YRS LATER
"She got them all lined up, like little Nazis."  2:02 I am dying 🤣
NOBODY TALKING ABT THE FOG?!?!
My parents would beat me so hard if I ever raised a hand to them
we need another one of these maybe a USA one ?
These kids are crazy I would have got backhanded if I did that
Sorry but up for adoption
I had some issues with my son when he was that age. We didn’t find out he was autistic until he was 6, so maybe she should get him to the doctor? 🤣🤷🏻‍♀️ he was nowhere near this bad behavior wise but this is me as a mom trying to give a kid the benefit of the doubt? 😬🤣🤣
Broooo im loving these consistent uploadssss
2:05 NOT DAZ CALLING THEM LITTLE NATZIS DJKASFJK
It's iggy back from the dead
what he said at the end of the video is so heart touching
I still don't curse in front of my parents
Anyone else’s mum obsessed with this show? Just mine? Ok 🥲
Team Gizmo!!!!
i watered u XD
Daz your amazing xx
"Oooh my god!  Some kid is going to get drop-kicked..." I lost it 🤣🤣🤣
Aye! Finally!
OMG YES I HAVE BEEN WANTING THIS VIDEO 😭
"pull my hair back and put me in blue" daz black 2021
This is luvly juvly
I did the exact same thing lmao but I got a hanger Broken on my ass lol
"Like little nazis" bruuhhhhh i love it
Gizmo is adorable but where's Honey?
Is it just me, or does anyone else think that he just needs a slap, it worked for me.
i used to watch the strictest parents in the uk or whatever they where called, i feel like it is honestly scripted, like the ending bit is scripted, but idk man, they all end w positive notes from all the ones i watched n so it just looks scripted, i haven't seen any that still ended terribly  super nanny is a dope show/series of these things, but it's sometimes just annoys me the way parents treat their own parents, it's why the children act back like that as they where brought up like it from a parent like her who keeps shouting at the kids
ive been waiting ages for this one
isn't the super nanny supposed to help😂
a dog really is a man's best friend 😂
I remember watching that show with my mom when I was little, and she'd always be like "Honey, I'm sorry that I ever thought you were a bad kid" 😂😂
See this is why I can never be a parent, that kid would get slapped right back
Waiting ✋
Your lonely? What happened to Linda?
DAZ I LOVE YOU DUDE <3
I be watching for this and 29 minutes
Your dog is adorable awwww  EDIT: I already don't want kids. I don't need a super nanny to tell me that
Eee finallyyyy
You always make my day better huge fan always make me laugh
you are no single man with a dog, you are a "fabulous dad in your area" who just so happens to have a dog
It’s very common for kids to be bad and violent when there’s absolutely no discipline. You can’t just sit there and wait for them to grow out of it, you show them that that behavior is unacceptable and won’t be tolerated. I believe spanking is a good option. But only if you tell them why they’re being spanked, and make sure they understand you’re doing it out of love. To teach them. I was spanked as a child and I thank my parents to this day. I wasn’t a perfect kid, but I behaved how I was supposed to. Not out of fear, out of respect.
You should play new world
HOW DOES DAZ  TURN A 2 MINUTE VIDEO INTO A 15 MINUTE VIDEO XD
My kid would try to hit me and i would put him to sleep in the fastest way possible 🤣🤣
hey look it's iggy   edit: i have a 3 year old step brother who fuckin bites you and hits you and i bruise like a damn banana so it hurts like hell, and he has a older that does jack shit so what i do is i hit him back and of course he cries and run off to my step mum. but can you blame me? (i also tell him that's what i feel and how do you like but i don't hit hard... well i hit him maybe as hard as a third of what i feel which makes him cry)
F#ck this im 14 and I don't want kids anymore
You should see America's super nanny, she locks them down.
Lol
Daz you should react to people who ARENT clinically insane.
HEY DAZ THERES A NEW LIFE IS STRANGE COMING OUT AND THOUGHT YOU WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT. ALSO IM STILL WORKING ON A REALLY GREAT GIFT FOR YOU 😁
I’m early for once? YESS!
I lost it at his childhood story 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Christ Daz, that white stuff on your lip was so triggering.
daz is so kind x
"I am a lonely single man with a dog"  And a daughter
GIZMO HAS GOTTEN SO BIG 😍😍😍
I haven’t watched a Daz video in a while and I forgot how much happiness it gave me✨❤️
My mom: My daughter is the best! So quiet and calm!  My dad: ......I’ve almost murdered my child 5 times this week because she wanders the house and the property at night like a mini serial killer and has snuck up on me multiple times.
FINALLY AHH
YES I love watching Jo’s videos
God those boys r like my little brother
Awh, Gizmo's sweet
That look is the most accurate Mum face I’ve ever seen 😂. Anytime I got that when I was younger I’d just stop dead in my tracks and apologise.
I have a question for you Daz, and I don't know if anyone has ever asked but I really want to ask, what prey tell is your favorite brand of tea?
The kid probably learnt the swear words from the parant also daz should do a supernanny sketch. Daz work is so good
12:52 throw him into the river at this point
The dog is thinking „I have an eye on You ”
Knew it! 😁😁
Hiii guys also gizmo is cute
"Birth control, we all need it "    The wise word of Daz Black
“‘Be a man’ there’s no such thing” a beautiful way of putting it. Daz is honestly just an amazing person
The nanny always looks so scared when the children act a fool after being 'nice' to the Nanny when they 1st meet her. Glad I made a decision not to have kids in the future.
GIZMO APPRECIATION 🙌
I’m up all night waiting for these type of videos (:
My hamsters name is gizmo-
Daz’s smile when interacting with gizmo gave off child at Christmas vibes- Dogs truly do bring out the best in us. Also, daz you should buy a flask. They have nice ones in primark for £4 and they keep tea boiling hot for hours
iiiiggggyyy yes I just made a jojo reference
I bet we can guess the boys favourite avenger
HI THERE
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sorry but kids usually only end up so bratty because they weren't raised properly to begin with and then the parents r like what the fuk is my kid on. Idk janine maybe the spoilt values you instilled In them as a toddler?
I LOVE SUPERNANNY! I’ve been wanting you to react to her for so long 🤣
Great video as always. 💕🤘🏻   I just took issue with a few of the things you said.   Number one: its scripted reality tv so dont have a crisis over it. 😅💕  No 2 Since we don’t actually know what happened or why she has us in the situation we can’t really judge it. But the boys on this channel need to know that Klaus can also be dicks about wanting to get pregnant without you knowing. And I don’t think it’s fair in that type of situation to hold a man responsible. Of course it’s nearly impossible to prove in such a situation. Another thing is there is always abortion. Not everyone should or has to have children just because society thinks it’s cute. And you don’t need children to be a woman. So everyone just needs to take a little bit more pressure off of themselves. But if you do decide to have kids then yes definitely rear them. There are many books in there is the Internet and don’t even courses for how to deal with your children. And just like with dogs apparently it depends upon the first few years of life. It’s OK if you don’t want to be ultra authoritarian, but you have to set some boundaries. And this woman doesn’t set boundaries at all.
This is so funny
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
like little natzizs im dead
Wait loner ? What about Linda 😂😂
OMG 31 MINS AND ALREADY 24K VEWIS WHAT THE HELL??
God we love you Daz ❤️ I love your message towards the end about having children !
LOL IM DYING BAHAHA THIS IS SO GOOD
I click on this video, and it was posted just a few minutes ago, I will be watching it later but right now I am in visual school.
Gizmo is so cute
I’m so happy for another daz watches!!
I have waited SO LONG for this😂👌
hey daz i’m pretty sure you’re not gonna see this but i really need to say thankyou to you’ve done so much i’ve been really struggling lately you’ve made me laugh through the hardest times you always make me laugh no matter what you’ve saved my life i’m so thankful for finding you i’ve followed you on every platform cause i love you so much i’m still struggling a lot but you make every day better thank you so much 😊
Me watching the kids start whacking the mum, I mean if i shouted at my mum i would already be dead.
What breed is gizmo?
Do dance moms please
Okay but I really like Joe, she is such a great help and the episodes are always so interesting to watch
I littery just watched a video where u just bought a dog now hes so big
I’ve been watching super nanny for about a year now and all I feel is happiness watching this
All I know is that if I was in a room with those little shits I'd be arrested for man slaughter
Daz you need to react to Scared Straight!
YAY A NEW VIDEO POSTED 30 MINUTES AGO :D
LOL 😂
Daz should react to Wife Swap!! 🤣🤣
💝🖤
im gay so i aint gettin no one pregnant
when I was on the naughty step when I was a kid I would just shuffle up and down the stairs until I was allowed off
OMG GIZMO SO CUTE
I like how it's "Super Nanny" but we bearly see her do anything or her
That dog is precio
I waited for this moment
The doggy 🥺😩
Please watch educating Yorkshire!!!
When he said thats naughty in the mic i was weasing lol
9:10 it's *the* mum look and holy sht sometimes it's truly terrifying
Is that a Jojo reference?
9:16 THAT IS THE EXACT LOOK   I used to run so fast 🤣🤣😭😭
Daz: **talks to dog** Also daz: **two seconds later** BIRTH CONTOL, WE ALL NEED IT
IV been waiting for this for AGESSS
Daz is the best ❤️❤️
No- seriously. YOU SHOULD BE THE NEW SUPER NANNY! ✨
Me: i've been crying for a moment because i saw something i shouldn't have seen about Daz in joujo.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor girlfriend
9:12 i did this to my mom she did the exat same thing
My moms naughty spot is a tall stepstool so they can't get off 😂
Pleaseeeee do another part or series of different suppernanny episodes 💕💕
26 minutes
Super nanny is gas 😂
Daz: a baby can always happen. Me: *laughs  in gay*
Hold on...... why is that adorable thing SO BIG!!!!!! like bro the last time i saw it it was a puppy they grow up to fast......
Damn that lighting
That mom has more patience than me I think I'd end up slapping them or punching a wall
*Toddler starts powering up on dining room table*
I always learned between discipline and abuse. Palm is discipline, backhand is abuse. I think you know what one works best.
i have 2 nephews who i help to look after and my youngest one is going through a phrase of biting and gosh it hurts and when he dose it i sit there going have you finished and he looks at me like no i havent and tries to do it again so i sit there and give him that mother look and he don't do it again hes also going through a stage of swearing his fav swear word at the moment is S**t and he ick that up from his mum and we tell him off and my oldest nephew tells him off as well and its so cute how my oldest nephew tells my youngest nephew off. I don't think super nanny will be able to sort my youngest nephew as he is a terrier and his only a year old.   But love the vid again Daz :)
Haha Gizmo
Lmao
my mom ran off on me, it sucks so bad. i agree with daz, weather you’re male or female do not run out on your kids.
Omg,let me tell you about having a silent angry mom..,As someone who has autism comes having sensory issues and my mom was just learning about it and would just stare at me when I would have a meltdown cause she though I being “naughty”.
This is the funniest please do more 😂
Hey Daz can you react to little mix please
Blue is my favourite colour
The thumbnail already got me laughing so I can tell this gonna be good
I never thought this day would come..I’m so happy  🥲
I knew twins who were on Supernanny, they were a year above me in primary school.  She didn't change them tbh, they were really bratty. I don't think many of us liked them 😅
Daz you are  you are funny
"Welcome back to Daz Games and another Daz watches.......BIRTH CONTROL!!" Omg I think I broke a rib lol
His dog should have his own episode
the boy in the family keeps hitting his mom. if his mom actually slapped tf out of him and disciplined him, he wouldn’t be hitting women. that’s actually really scary thst he’s doing that bc the mom isn’t doing a good job being a parent and teaching him respect. he’s gonna grow up an think it’s ok to hit women and become abusive when he grows up
All ways great watching your watch videos
Ok so my first thoughts are OMG!!!!!!! THERE'S A CUTE PUPPY  HE IS SO ADORABLE!!! I love him so much and honestly Daz that's how I met my boyfriend he was out walking his dog and I was walking home 🐕🐶 so you never know 😊🥰 so weird I've literally just been watching Supernanny
We need more Gizmo in your videos !!
Hi

I love ur vids

Leaves from the vine Falling so slow Like fragile tiny shells Drifting in the foam Little soldier boy Come marching home Brave soldier boy Comes marching home...
I once bit my mom when I was little  like 6 . And then my dad bit me back swear to God never bit anyone  again
please i just saw your story on insta and i knew for sure he was gonna appear on the video for a bit 😭😭❤️
Hurd his mam story before but its a blast from the past too hear it again
Honestly, kids need structure and discipline and are so much happier with it, because they want clear communication too!  A lot of parents will just threaten a punishment and never act on it.  It confuses them.  Also, if they're acting out they need punishment, they need to be shown harming others is not okay and has consequences.  They don't have to be physical.  It's usually something as simple as not being able to go somewhere they want, or have a candy they want or a toy.    She lets them run all over her!!!  I hope they're doing well now.
muhamed ali's reincarnate right there
Me: i've been crying for a moment because i saw something i shouldn't have seen about Daz in joujo.Lol again: I just saw the dms, poor girlfriend
Daz just makes my day better. And thank God he plays horror games, because I can't get through them myself. Lol I live through his heart attacks, one at a time.
is the "naughty spot" from London the equivalent to the "naughty corner" in America? DAZ I NEED TO KNOW
Oh my lord Gizmo! hello little Gizmo I hope your doing well. Also Hi Daz! 🤗🤗🤗🤗
What the dog doin
If I would've flipped my mom off I would've went flying across the room cuz she would've knock the hell outta me. I'm talking like Rocky.
Bruh, Daz's stern mom look gave me PTSD flashbacks 😂😂😂
the moment i saw the little dude. i knew he was gonna be the main hooligan😂😂
Wow, a good morning AND an upload? Fuck YES
This should be good
I seem to recall being a kid and being sent to my room, and I was so stubborn that I tried to really stick it to my mum by shouting that she could send me there for hours if she wanted and I wouldn't care. Telling her to punish me all she wanted and I wouldn't care seemed like a g r e a t idea. Except she did. I was a nightmare.
My kitten's name is Gizmo sometimes we call him "Misty Moo" because when he meows he sounds like a cow. But we still like Gizmo. I Love your Gizmo and I hope you would love mine if you met him.
younger me trying this with my parents future me r.i.p
yessssssss i loved it u gotta do a part 2 and 3 and 4 and so on lol , love u daz always have and always will!! x
Like is Daz is the best
:))
3:22 understandable Daz, they gave me a certificate for making someone laugh 🤷🏻‍♀️
if i was that mother, i literally would lose it and just smack the fuck out of those kids. it’s called DISCIPLINE and parents need to USE IT
Daz: Jo looks like a IKEA couch  Me: 🤣🤣
“Full time punching bag”😭
3:30 don't worry I got a certificate for liking geese, they called it the power of the goose award (and my friend got the most expressive face award)
Im pissing myself laughing 💀
"YOUR SENTENCE SHORTENED OR FREEDOM!?" and "Look at joe just standing there in the corner...looks like a curtain" I can't sometimes, this is what I'm here for, you make my day man 🤣🤣
YES DAZ LOVE THE VIDS
19 minutes ago, I'm early for once.
Hi daz I love your content🥰
“I’d give the mum a month before she’s dead” I can’t 😭😭
*runs to the kitchen to prepare tea * WAIT UP I GOTTA FIND MA BISCUITS
IVE WANTED THIS FOR SO LONG! THANK YOU DAZ!
9:40 I got one for ya. I was talking to my mom and has my hands on one of our highboy chairs in the kitchen. She somehow thought that i flipped her off while i was talking to her. No reason to flip her off, both hands on the chair flat and all fingers down. To this day i dont know why she thought i flipped her off. Her reaction was a total surprise.
Omg🤣🤣🤣
My cat has the same name as Daz's dog. My life is fulfilled
Not me thinking naughty spot is privets 😂
Daaaaaz please watch Ugandan Action Movie Trailers!!!!! (Tebaatusasula is my favorite!!!! It's maddddddd!)
Daz: “I’ve got my tea, hope you got yours” Me with a pot of gravy: “well not exactly”
This has been a long time coming..... FINALLY!!!! 🥳🥳🥳
what a pretty puppy :D
Part 22222222
GIZMO
Who else had a bad day but now is happy because daz uploaded?
Gizmo's expression is a big mood
We need a part 2
I JUST REALIZED HOW EARLY I AM MY GOD-
The way my mom dealt with kids throwing a fit about the menu was she'd look at them and say "alright, you can eat at lunch then." (Or supper, or breakfast, whichever one was next) they eventually would get hungry enough to eat what she fixed 😂
It’s blue day!🥶
nice vid bro
Finally he watched super nanny
“These kids are SATAN” 😭😭
Can we get  another one pls
srsly you make me so happy . i couldn’t stop crying and now watching your vids just makes me smile and laugh
Aw, Gizmo is so cute! Also, Supernanny I used to watch as a kid and it still reminds me as to why I don't want children.
I was 17 seconds early on his hotel video now I’m 17 minutes on this lol
And my mother says that me and my siblings are bad children if that was my child i would have so many ways stopping them she really needs help
I used to watch super nanny a lot😂
YES, IT IS HAPPING! THE MOMENT WE HAVE ALL BEEN WATING FOR IS HERE.
I'm so glad adouption exists
Wise words from daz at the end !! I’ve been a mum since 16 he’s only 2 but when he has a tantrum you get so many horrible looks off people and it makes you feel low as shit but what can you do? All you can is tell the child “no” and “this is naughty”
Thank you daz for that PSA about father hood and taking responsibility if you knock up a girl and being a good human being
Your dog is the cutest 🥺😭❤️
The the bj he's getting 10:00
I love dad so much he’s funny and teaches u important life lessons
This video made me wanna throw my phone because THAT CHILD IS FRICKING SATAN JUST EAT THE SANDWICH AND GO TO SCHOOL also why did it say 1 like when I liked AM I THE FIRST PERSON THAT LIKED HECK YEAH YES why does it feel so good it's like you feel like a god
Yep I would go to jail
🤣🤣🤣😂😂
:Mum gets punched in the t#t and shrugs it off  :daz ahhh right in the t#t  :me just waiting for the Mum to elbow drop the kid   Sorry if I sound mean
Awww its done already:(
if he's not hungry then don't feed him its his fault he'll starve for the rest of the day
Daz you're so great for your responsibile parent talks. I do feel for this mom, I think even reaching out to make some mom friends can help her if she's completely alone in this. That's rough.
Yes him with a dog intro. We all need a Daz talk.
I lost it at the electric bill joke 🤣
OMG EARLY I LOVE U DAZ UR SO FUNNY 😂
DAZ: I know your after my following gizmo GIZMO: Why am I here I just wanna SLEEPPP
Bring back sims 🥺
Damm I never even saw super nanny help out like Gurl stop enjoying the show and get over here
AWWWWW hi Gizmo!
I remember getting put on the naughty step when I was little, and I have anger issues so I got so angry. But I’m the type of person who stays silent and stares when they’re angry, and if they push me too far I will explode. So anyway, every time I got put on the naughty step I peeled the wallpaper off. And eventually, half the wallpaper was off and we had to get new wallpaper :D
I love me some supernanny. But I really love daz watches
The things what daz says is true
IGGY
When daz got an award for shiny shoes 😂😂 And last week I actually got an award for being noticed I’m not even joking🤷🏼‍♀️😂
I would disown those kids, swear to god
Nanny McPhee who? Been waiting for this!!! 😂👌
No keep full eye contact. Mom dominance. I'm not looking you up and down, we're not squaring up. I'm watching hard for the tears of fear to start welling up....
leave it alone gizmo
Daz watches are just the best 😂
Daz can react dance moms I think you would enjoy it 😀😀
How can we suggest videos for you?
The council state version of mrs doubtfire 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 2 minutes in and you already made my day man!
REACT TO LIFE OF LUXURY ✨
The iconic "I'm on moi way"
When I was younger my mum used the naughty step and she never hit me or anything but if I was put on the naughty step I wouldn’t even think about moving I could of got up but I didn’t
You should do a super nanny choreographer skit for the day black channel
popper
“ nanny McPhee nanny McPhee we need you” 😂

Daz needs to react to worlds strictest parents next lol
Daz*
Lol
"I should be Supernanny!"  Oh God, imagine that, "Linda, the lack of tea on my desk is totally unasseptable!"
Dad I went to SHENLEY primary school…
I swear  daz is the most relatable person ever 😂
I remember when I used to watch Super Nanny a bit when I was younger and I remember the lady that’s in Blue I think.
I'm glad daz is giving us life lesson 💯
I had the naughty step and would be so confused but I’d just: 🧎🤨😕

I once won a prize for having the oddest socks on odd sock day. I got a chocolate bunny and a plastic medal. That was fun.
Daz is the best!
my dad got us kids to stay still through fear. or he would make us do like write a sentence over and over for 6months until it had no meaning. also i have trauma from him verbally and emotionally abusing me with worse shit
8:30 I remember your told us that story before in an older video lmaoooo
I remember when daz told the story of him flipping his mum off when he was  annoyed lol
12:44 lol I died too😂
sometimes hitting ur kids back is okay 🥰🥰
Used to love this show
If I ever did any of these things to my mom she would smack me with a shovel and my dad would beat the crap out of me we're not actually he just give me a whooping but whatever
The thumbnail😂
