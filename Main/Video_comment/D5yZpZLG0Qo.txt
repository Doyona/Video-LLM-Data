I LEARN  SO MUCH FROM YOUR PODCAST. DRAYMOND,, I USED TO BBE A CHICAGO BULL FAN....DYNAMITE TEAM BUT WHEN MJ FINALLY RETIRED,  I STOPPED WATCHING BASKETBALL 🏀 🤔  THEN I HEARD ABOUT THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS  .I LOVED THE TEAMMATES  THE LOVE THEY HAD AS A  TEAM....I SAW HOW. THE TOGETHERNESS ..I LOVE THE GAME ITSELF BEING SKILLFULLY...AND THAT BEAUTIFUL  .... DRAYMOND  AS YOU'RE TALKING NOW I'M LEARNING MORE THAN I'VE EVER REALIZED 😳 😕 🤩 😂 ❤❤🎉
Man considering the antics he pulls on the court, he's like super chill, organized and dishes shit out in a really classy manner. Respect bro
6:25 - 12:26 😂
Quite frankly might as well be his catchphrase since he mentioned those words so many times
Aged like milk
Quite frankly, good episode
Draymond,,,,you seriously talk to much!!!! Go work on your game , and shut your mouth. Try not punching your teammates.
This age well
The difference is, Dray has more than earned his right to talk big, Brooks never will earn it it seems
Like what you are doing on and off the court my brother.. so keep Ballin on and off the court..peace..!
This ages like fine wine 🍷 . He will not be resigned “under any circumstances”
Trust me....THE ONE GOD LOVES YA D! NO DOUBT! GREAT ADVICE TO MORANT....WHEN DONE, CAN YOU ASSIST ME IN DEVELOPING OUR AFRICAN LEAGUE?
I'm not a Dylan Brooks fan but maybe you're not the right man to be pontificating about DB! youre a joke yourself! Lol
Wow, what a Strong Message. He has come to far to lose  everything. Stay Focused Ja.
What he said about putting yourself in a position and people telling you I told you so, he is so so right 100% right and the bright light just came on for me anyway
I'm now a Draymond Green fan Can't wait for your retirement in a good way bro bro Your a hella intelligent outlook host&speaker
9:36 apollo & the gift of prophecy
9:36 is sooooo quotable 💯
9:35 Draymond is a prophet.
🇯🇲 Mr Green to the world, determined a never die attitude 🙏💯
“Im tryna figure out why they like you in Memphis… or do they like you in Memphis?” Hits waaaaay different now 😂😂
Back after the Grizzlies told Dillon Brooks to f*** off
I’m a  die hard laker fan but be careful what u say about them warriors they can shoot your light outs in  4 seconds if they get the ball
future Inside the NBA host
Well draymond is right, Memphis dont like him coz their not bringing him back in any circumstances
This aged well
His team didn’t even like him 😭💀. Grizzlies said ‘under no circumstances are u coming back’
This aged nicely 😎 12:06
This aged well
8:51 is what you're probably here for
Had to come back to hear that draymond line. Dynasty starts after you, not with you 🤔 memphis champs next year 👀
This aged like fine wine after Shams tweet that Grizzlies don't want Dillon Brooks back next year lmao
This aged like fine wine
lol this aged well😂😂
memphis jus told him to clear his locker and gave him a bus ticket home lmaooo
The dynasty about to start now IG.. mans really got released
I like Draymond. He's an intelligent guy. Misunderstood.
I’ll take playoff Murry over Morant and for face of nba
Draymond knew this whole damn time tht Memphis were frauds.
This has to be so awesome for Draymond & Klay in particular when the Lakers destroyed the Grizzlies in game 6.
1 thing is for certain Draymond has a huge responsibility to control & dominate his role in different fashion. I love that he's punishing the Kings accepting his role off the bench what a true pro.
Hey dubs seems as though you guys are in for another viciously competitive road to the finals!.
this feels so sweet esp after the gadooshing they got from bron. Dillon you my man has to learn mandarin
Ain't no team more famous then memphis grizzlies right now with the most playoffs losses in the history of the NBA oh we'll they sure earned it oh and by the way I'm a grizzlies fan 💀💀💀
Draymond could you comment about Dillon dodging the media last night 😂
I love this guy.Draymond has a very high basketball I.Q. quite frankly
Ja should watch this👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
He never got suspended, Dray!!!
Kind of hard to see your favorite player when he is on load management?
I have a new found respect  for Draymond I'm a big Ja fan but I agree with what Dray said about him
Talk that shit.
I'm from somalia east Africa 🌍  dray get suspended game 3 I feel  was wrong and makes nba easy to play woke up nba tell me how he can button his legs on the floor
caralho que jantada da porra kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk calma  green na cara não , pra não estragar o velório kkkkkkkk
I belive  Mr Green is the right one to put that Ass hole in his  place regarding the king.
Wow!! Wow!! Bravo DG. You said it best about Dillon.
💙💙💛💛GSW forever 🙏🙏🙏 hats off for you Sir .. hope to see you in game 4 🙏🙏🙏🙏💪🙏💪🙏🙏💪💪💪 we miss you on the basketball 🏀 court
I got a design  for a  t-shirt  for you
I simply do not respect the basketball opinion of someone who thinks Draymond is a 'bad person'. I am NOT a Warriors fan, but if you don't take the time to finish this and understand people for a split second, I can't respect your opinions about the NBA. Great insight displayed by one of the biggest brains in the league, cheers.
Damn Draymond ya know people always ask what does Draymond Green do?  The man is the heart of the dubs and Dillon Brooks is just running around doing crazy stuff.  Big difference
When I watched the Warriors play the Grizzlies live on Christmas day it was a fantastic game the only person the Grizzlies that pissed me off was Dillion Brooks he kept trying to injure our players. I told my husband if he keeps it up he's going to end up out of the league because of his mouth and his dirty plays. I believe Dillion Brooks want to be Draymond so bad, Dillion fails to realize Draymond is the glue to the Warriors dynasty with his ability to play defense, score, assists, rebound, box out and his ability to talk shit and back it up while winning championships. Dillion watch yourself you are getting too cocky and you don't have any rings to back it up.
Love the show
Pels fan here Pshhh cant do nothing but respect Draymond he keeps it 💯.
Thank you for the grace draymond for Speak it up in offering support of Ja. *FACTS*
Gun are not an issue, The thugs and unstable with them are the issue. But you are a millionaire so i dont expect you to know sht about the real world. Brooks is also no bigger of a clown than you have been, I expect him to start kicking people in the nuts and punching his team mates before he is labeled a clown. As far as your Tee Morant bs goes. Raising a successful "BLACK" American is easier than raising a successful  "Black" anywhere else on earth. You guys need to stop with the racist color bs. Tee raised a Thug that just happened to have skills to hoop. He is a basketball career away from being a gang banger on the streets. Get fricken real.
This Make Me Respect Draymond Even More 💪🏾⛹🏾‍♂️💯💯🥇
Wow.... You're a fantastic human being.   God bless you,  bro.   ❤❤❤
Hey Mr. Triple Single, why don't you use your podcast time to train harder to help your team and quit talking on other teams that are doing better than you.
you have a nerve to speak on dillon brooks
The more serious he get, the more funny this gets
Green building this channel while playing. By the time he leaves the league this podcast will be big time with millions of subscribers bringing in tens millions monthly. If he keeps it going. I would advise him to stay independent and not join any of the sports talk shows. Just build this up enough that's it just as big or bigger and keep the majority of revenue. Sponsorships etc will be worth it.
This aged like milk after Draymond got a 16th tech for throwing the basketball at Russell Westbrook's head during the recent Clippers game. Then, Memphis destroyed the Warriors and Dillon Brooks got the post-game interview for his performance. I might watch this show more often now. Pure comedy.
Good podcast though.. You right, you cant control a grown man. Refreshing to hear some genuine talk in the midst of all this flakiness. And "Grace" is definitely the word needed for this decade.
Imma need you gone buss that pimple on your forehead fam.. lol
Lebron made it hard for the next face lbvs u gotta be flawless in and off the court Gianni's might be the closet
Grace is🔑💚
Great take!  Yes, we all need to recognize the gift of grace and the gift of rationality.  Keep in mind that human brains don’t finish developing until around 23 years of age.  I can’t begin to imagine the stress in  young people who achieve so much in their early professional lives, but we all should never assume that the lives of others are easy.  Ja said he needs to learn how to release his anxieties in a healthy way.  He admitted was releasing anxiety with that foolish video stunt.  That is a hopeful glimmer to me.  I crave laughter and silliness to release stress too.  I think he can find ways to be silly without doing harm to himself.  You’re an impressive man, Draymond.  Keep showing everyone what your about, there’s a lot of love in you.
He said Laker game was weird and seen some things he never seen in his life lol.
Coming from the guy you wanted to be like. That sucks  man.
Come on man, you guys only seem to play as a team more at home.  How can get right with no Andrew Wiggins, and you resigned  Gary Patton III  but, hardly play him. Jordan Poole's mental lapses don't help either. I hope Steph has plenty of mouthpieces because while Poole is playing plenty of his mouthpieces will be tossed.
I Think that Dillon Brooks is going to really get under Dreymon skin which he already has and completely dominate. Keep talking your shit Draymond.
Cwc- dray day, called ur show that
Dam nba be talk like the streets got to be private
Dray, is one of the overated players watch and see 15 years if that from now this nigga will be called overated in a league that plays pussy foot defense. But none the less brooks shouldn't have said shit.
Dang!!!
Why doesn’t donkey talk about Wiggins
Draymond well spoken with Truly FACTS, IT IS WHAT IT IS. Hopefully Ja can get through this and learn from it, Praying for Ja Moran I watched him and saw that he was out of control .
Dillon Brooks is just a kupal
Quite frankly ima big fan of this podcast but quite frankly you saying quite frankly a lil too much big dawg god bless
Your Ja Morant take was ridiculous. Grace? Benefit of the doubt? The guy flashed a gun while drinking and spending $50,000 in a strip club on his own social media. He not only did it but he broadcasted it himself. Benefit of the doubt? Grace? What sort of message is he sending to his millions of young fans? What sort of grace did he show? And it makes me crazy when NBA players use the phrase “feed their children.”  Do you even hear yourself? Feed their children? Morant has made more than $50 million in the NBA. His kids are going to eat just fine if his career ended today. If “regular” people like me flashed a gun at a strip club on the Internet or punched out a co-worker, we’d be fired immediately from our jobs. Immediately. You need a reality check. You’ve been living in the privileged world of the NBA too long.
6:25 to 12:25. You’re welcome.
Quite frankly
Great job Draymond, so funny
Facts... Once Again The Jedi Green Beats Me To My Mind, You Dam Good Man..
😂😂😂
Great words of wisdom for Ja and Dillon.  I hope they're wise enough to listen and accept the constructive criticism.
😂😂😂😂
We love Warriors and Draymond Green.    Take care of your heart .. that guy Brook got nothing to prove yet as a basketball player...  I hope when you face Memphis again.   Keep your patience Draymond .   Don't put that clown in your nerves.    Your fans here from Philippines 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
Why do you keep say “In America” like there is a place better for any race.
Dray spoke so much truth in this. The grace part is so huge.
Impressive Draymond Green. That talk was a Grand Slam, a 100yd run to secure a Super Bowl win, a half court shot in the last micro seconds in game 7 of NBA Finals that wins a championship.  My take away, fans don't really know players like they know a close friend.  Players are people who make mistakes like everybody else. Ja Morant's father ain't the issue.  Because of grace Ja Morant still has a opportunity to put this mistake behind him.  Once again, great job Draymond Green.
Keep doing you and your way of speaking with thought and prayers of what your saying!!! This from a 58yr old Father of 4 and 5 Grandkids!! Salute young man 🤲🏿
Bro you need work on your background! I mean you have 100 mill in the bank and you over there on your couch. Take one of the 9 bedrooms you have, paint it a cool color, add some cool lighting, and hang Dope jerseys and sports memorabilia on the walls especially behind you!  A little effort bro!!
I’m just confused on how the Warriors got 4 but KD still need to proove himself !
Have to admit, the first few times I saw Brooks play, and didn't know who he was, I thought he looked like a dude who was lucky to be in the NBA.  And, frankly, my view hasn't changed since.
My boy Draymond Killin em with the MAJOR ACCOLADES. not a golden state fan but as a basketball fan. Far from delusional, dray defensive and mental work is top notch.
Dre's Show Series in 2024 should be called: Agree- "Quite Frankly the Next Level Show" for 2024
This dude says the word “ quite frankly “ a lot. I mean a whole lot 🤦🏾‍♂️
DRAYYYYYY 🏆🏆🏆🏆
Warriors should trade dray for brooks ( yes draymond was good for there system but hes older slower so not as good ) … klay and steph cane get another but wisman didnt pan out… so they need to go get a good 5 man thats younger tougher
This guy has a fantastic story telling ability, or a great ghost writer. Just an incredible way to let the fans into the season’s many different fascinating moments
It seems like his dad said ahh my son made it. We rich forever !  My job done !!!  Ja go to the hood in Memphis  find a gang and tell them you’ll fund them & if we can rep them they can travel wit us. I wanna claim folk. Iight dad. I’ll call Carlton. He knows a guy who goes to the highschool in the ghetto. He listens to young boy so he can teach us all the lingo & how to act like yb & king von.  6nine type lame paying to be in a gang lookin ass.
You guys need to pick up your game!
Draymond should definitely have his own show after he retires from the NBA.  Or he should just continue his own podcast.
You spoke the the truth Dray
That was a small toy 🔫
Wait dray I agree with everything you said.. BUT YALL HAD ZAZA, WDYM DYNASTIES DONT HAVE CLOWNS
Do they like you in Memphis ? 🤣 That’s the real question 😂
Love the reference to Dillion “kid” Brooks. I felt that burn.
Draymond your a good player but all the hate for our team is bs but expected , but guess what Memphis has always been underdogs and we love it , people always count us out but we count ourselves in like it or not and we don’t give a fuck who likes us or not, and u won’t be getting shit right in Memphis but an ass whooping, in the words of the legend Al Capone whoop that trick
Well youre great but you do be D kicking lol
Are you kidding me!?? Draymond Green you absolutely cannot control your temper. You went back to game 5, what about all incidents you had since then! You just recently punch the smallest, youngest, cutest guy on the team in the face  because you cannot control your temper! And you're clearly a hater. You just a joke 😡
Lol... "Champ"😂😂
Memphis Fans suck
Team Draymond here. Cant stand the Grizzlies
some soul searchin lmao
Lavar Ballish 😂😂😂😂
This is why I roll with Dray, he's a real one. Though I'm a Cavs fan, Dray is one of my favorite Warriors because this dude is solid.
Great Job on ja and his dad💯💪🏿🤲🏿
West not stacked bro
You remind me of Patrick Ewing
Blessed breda Jamaica in the house
Hola!!! Just look at it this way, you have a gift. You get to play a game for a living. You work hard strength training, yoga, cardio, diet. But, it's just a game most of us don't get to play. Y'all are an AMAZING group of people. Life's never promised, give yourself a break once in a while, after all your human just like me and my daughter. We love to have fun too! So, have fun, work hard, and give 100% of love (true love) to what you love. And, finally always stay humble, MUCH LOVE!!! OUR WORLD UNITED!!!
Dray got love for that Grizzlies squad minus brooks lol
13:35 I agreed with most of what you said but this right here was a garbage statement. That's exactly what people do nowadays. You got people getting fired over Twitter post. Ja should be grateful that he's a nba star because any normal person would be getting fired right about now. Not that I want that or agree with it but that's reality for us normal people. We have to be careful or lose our livelihoods over some bs.
Draymond might be the next Stephan A . Great takes 🔥
Dray been on some lazy shii for the past 4 years since he got that 100 mill. then he link with bron and had his ride on his nuts through the summer and this season .. You punched JP cause he got yo contract money and the warriors are rebuilding slightly with the younger core.. Your time is up in The bay bro you just been on some whatver type stuff this season and that’s crazy I’m still a fan of you fasho you helped us win them chips my baby 💯 but you been on some bull since klay went down
You cant be the face if you dont Kiss ass or show you can kiss ass unless you were bless in already
How many rings Dillon have...none .....draymond  4
Draymond Green have 4 rings...Grizzlies players can't said that
Wow, great episode man 👏🏿 👏🏿 👏🏿.  Subscribed!
Broke that down perfectly 💯‼️
Draymond a true leader… that knocks out his own teammate
Great show
Fam we loosing games..no disrespect, but you need to do your podcast doing the off season…
That's why they like me.... Kid... 🤣🤣🤣
YOU A STRAIGHT BUM.. YOUR TEAM IS ASS!
I got a question for Draymond. He said Championships determine rivalries….  So what was the Bulls and Pacers in the 90s?  The Lakers and Kings early 2000s? The Knicks and Bulls in the 90s? Most of Jordan rivals NEVER won a chip.  Stop tryna rewrite history cause you don’t like somebody. Championships NEVER in the HISTORY OF BASKETBALL was ever the focus of a rivalry. You and Shannon Sharp the only two people i heard say that and what do yall have in common? Y’all don’t like the Grizzlies. Even Klay and Steph nodded toward the notion of the Grizz/Warrior even being rivalry. If you scared cause you see your downfall abroad say that. Tryna rewrite history cause the Grizzlies on yall ass!
Although I don't agree w Ja brandishing a firearm, he has a right to carry one to protect himself. Just cuz he's famous doesn't exclude him from his rights. Should definitely take classes and training though so he's educated on how to exercise that right.
A dad can’t control his grown son 😂😂😂 raised him or not
Of course the answer is no your right
“iM nOT sSuRe iF uR tEaMmAtEs liKe U” Draymond, the likable, Green
same reason why golden state warriors won't win championship this year is because of this IDIOT... right here!
GRACE!
😂😂YOU LOST😂😂😂😂
Grace lmao if we did that we get arrested but a high end basketball player oh they get such a sweet outcome
Get it Dray, get it !
6:33 We getting right to it homie.
I would have thought Draymond's biggest regret was punching Poole.
Yes. I actually have a friend who played basketball and was a student of the game and he didn't know Draymond from a can of paint and he was very judgemental in his remarks about that incident.
Draymond is the best at responding to Dillon's rant. Draymond is a GOAT at responding to Dillon. I completely understand the difference between the "Old School" and the "New Media".
Keep getting Clay the Ball he was turning his back on the Ball he is mad about not getting the ball feed him when he hot GS need a another Big Really bad and jp need to come off the bench praying that Wiggins is back soon they need him and Payton and set more picks for Curry and Clay 💪🏾💪🏾
How tf is Ja gonna be the face of the nba when jayson Tatum exists ?!
Draymond "Quite Frankly" Green
It's a blessings to hear from you about this story..amen 🙏 Grace is the best..glory.
Amen bro, Ja is 23 years old. And I remember when I was that young, I did dumb things.. shall I be accountable for the rest of my life?
dray got his ass kicked
“1 less technical than your dumbass” 😂😂😂
just learned his favorite phrase is quite frankly
Draymond talk like he got a mouthful of spit
Proof is in the pudding. I would like to know how as a leader Draymond is Galvanizing our defense to win today. Sounds like Dray cares more about pettiness and taking victory laps on his accolades than focusing on truly repairing the turmoil and togetherness of our team. Maybe he thinks they’re passed it. But proof is in the pudding.
Dray gonna STFU after sucking for the rest of of his career.  Or maybe not.  Biggest GSW Fan here. Guaranteed Draymond is a CLOWN.
You put the NBA in a tough spot.  Hard to win a Championship when then team falls apart because of Draymond Green.
Draymond the goat
Draymond has learned a lot over his many battles. There’s a lot of wisdom spoken in this video. 🏆
He always says "quite frankly"
Dray. You are messing up our team.   The fact that you tied to inbound the ball to Klay when he wasn't looking and Dillon beat you on the play is terrible.   That's not winner mentality.    The fact that you got in Dillon's face immediately and hit him in the face with your forearms, should have been your second tech cause you already got away with one you should have been called for. If you didn't already have a tech,  what you did to Dillon should have been an immediate ejection.    The fact that you sucker punched Jordan in preseason already means you are in very thin ice.   I wanted GSW to trade you along with Wiseman to get a star like Myles Turner.  Problem is, because of your issues we may not have a taker.  Dray, when you contract expires this year, you may not have a taker.   You may have to retire.    GSW doesn't have salary cap room for you anymore. You messed up our team.  Draymond.... even Steve Kerr was recorded on live TV  saying I'm tired of Draymond's SHI*.
QUITE FRANKLY, this was a good podcast 😆. Keep it up brother!
F U Drsy.  You are the problem. You should have had 2 techs and an ejection. Even if the first one wasn't a tech, your confrontation with Dillon Brooks should have been an automatic ejection. You repeatedly hit Brooks in the head with your elbow.  I was hopeful that you would have been traded for Myles Turner in the recent trade deadline.  You are a strain shithead.  Why did you try to pass it to Klay when he wasn't looking? BROOKS... HE won the play and you couldn't accept it. You should have been ejected.  I don't want you on my team.  You should see your coach's face as it happened. Kerr was done with you.  I know Kerr has been recorded in TV games saying I'm ducking done with Draymond.  Head get too big, you lose.  Your head is way too big.  The Golden State Warriors are what makes me happier than anything else. Fuck You Draymond Green. You don't understand.  You fucked my favorite team up. Fuck you. Memphis is obviously much better than you right now.  Fuck you Draymond.  Why did you allow that turnover that Dillon stole from you on the inbound pass... it's cause you are toast and Dillon and the Grizz are next.  You are right.  It's not a rivalry... cause you suck.  One the Grizz beat the Dubs in the playoffs, it's over. The Grizz will absolutely own the Dubs.  Or maybe the Dubs will never be again good enough to match up... that is likely Dray.  I want you off our team yesterday Dray.  You f'eededxup big time in this game how you reacted against Dillion Brooks.  Have some grace, Dray... stfu bout Ja... correct you bullshi on the cort and in practice first.  You are a  piece  of shite. It makes me happiest to see the Warriors win.  You need to be gone... potentially no one wants you S*head.
Here's the deal our 28 year old kid was acting out and not in a safe way. We took his guns and locked them up... Your parenting doesn't end at 18... Tee needed to do better for his son IMO...
I'm a big Grizzlies fan, but I LIKE "this" particular podcast that you put out Draymond.
☠
Draymond green says "quite frankly" to sound smarter than he actually is lol
I've heard conversations about how awesome a 6'6" AI would have been.  A Ja Morant at that height may be scarier.
He got all that money and holding his mic he wanted us to hear everything he had to say😅😂
Hey drey stop talking and just play , you suck this year !
So you couldn't just take him under your wing?
Bruh took an L after all the 🧢
Hay  Draymond... Brooks is giving you the middle finger... they gave your as is a good drubbing hahahahahah.  Golden State clowns with so called 3 future hall of famers will not even make the playoffs this year... but go ahead just keep yapping hahahaha
Dillon Brooks did speak some facts about Draymond though. Draymond did a great job fulfilling his role for the Warriors but we all have to be honest about that being the perfect situation for him. Hopefully the Warriors have a higher level of understanding of the game of basketball and keep Draymond around for the ride going forward.
Celtics fan , with all respect for Dra!!!!
Quite frankly Draymond needs to quite frankly stop saying quite frankly so much……quite frankly
the NBA is just TMZ for men
Bruh draymon its beast its the modern Denis rodman luv his intensity 💪
8:02 😂😂😂 tell that clown 🤡 Dray!!
GSW IS ALWAYS MY TEAM
People gunna come here after the game but tbh it ages well
L
Hahahaha…..you tell them clowns🤣🤣🤣
You can’t compare the average working joe that’s working 9-5 to an NBA superstar who’s known worldwide so of course he will be held to different degree 🤷🏼‍♂️
Pro sports doesn't care about kids learning that violence is ok if u get a fine r out of some games it's been going on for years that's why pro sports players r still doing it
Memphis destroyed you!!!!!
Look, it's Dillon Brooks' son
Thanks for the code, great game tonight in Memphis, they was laughing at me cheering for you 🥳🥳🥳, I had to let them know that we’re both from the North Side of the Nasty 💙, Big Trojans, Big Saginaw Michigan
Who's the clown tonight stfu
when we get Gary back & the team gets used to playing around Steph again.. it’s gonna be scary
I don’t want you to ever say another word unless you can back it up the way you guys played tonight makes this podcast look like you don’t know what your talking about he wiped the floor with you guys tonight and it’s ridiculous at this point
Concentrate on Basketball, you can barely talk....bbbb bbub bbu bbbb
We need better personnel. This isn't the same championship team we had last year. It's time to bring in some more dogs that can defend and get buckets.
Thanks for motivating us to smoke y’all by 20. Good luck in the play in. I remember a team that knocked y’all out last time 🫣🤭
Y’all was Trash today😂. How embarrassing.
Who’s here after the Grizzlies “Whoop That Trick”!
why u keep saying quite frankly
who won?
Who’s here during this ass whooping Grizzlies are giving GS the very next game lmao  Talk about aged poorly!
This aged pretty well huh
What happened?
Bra u got carried to rings Dillion brooks is right
he should call this podcast Quite Frankly
Draymond is the type who’s always the loudest one at the party that’s why nobody’s scared of his soft sorry behind
Draymond is the smartest and wisest soul in the NBA, Lebron aside.
No disrespect Dillon, but U and Dray not in the same convo. U didn’t do nothing yet but first round & 2nd round exits. Y’all definitely not going to the Chip no time soon. Steph,Jokic and KD in the west 🤣🏃🏾
Aye anybody know the score of the game right now
Crazy how Draymond Green disrespecting the best all talk NBA team of all time
I love Dray u and Steph are my favorite no matter people say I got your back will defend u always we are in a world where u can please everyone and don’t try to please yourself first much love bro much love
That is why I respect Draymond
Draymond hit the nail on the head. Dillon shot himself in the foot.
His ugly ass so annoying cause he’s right about everything 🤣 how he delivers everything is so funny🤣
Ahhh you not a champ! 😂😂
Quite frankly
Warriors is like 6-27 on the road this year. The warriors play the grizzlies tonight who y'all rolling with?
Quite frankly
Dray thank you for speaking facts brother, you really spoke from your wisdom and heart.
Nice Work Sir
I am from Memphis I give you thumbs up you speaking good advice on a lot of thing let them know is anytime have fun be successful and help change things for the better can't help everybody help them understand it's a better one wrong move for a black man calls you everything how about yourself

Honestly Brooks has alot more clowing to do before he reaches the clown level Draymond is at. The fact this dude has a platform is hilarious.
I hope Ja is serious enough about what Draymond said and think about this long and hard
Dramon… my brother, I am a huge Grizzlies fan from the Memphis area. I must say, everything you said regarding Ja… was on point. As a black man myself, I appreciate you stating by your peer and fellow brother. Keep on keeping it real. Much love-1.
Man fuck this let’s talk about you quitting mid game
Did well with the advice Dray. Keep it up
Quite Frankly
Micheal Jordan was the face of the NBA and got his dad killed over his gambling debt. Also Allen iverson shot his baby mama n still in the hall of fame .. ja morant a goat.. but draymond is right.. u setting an example for kids that ain’t the way to do it
Quite Frankly, Poole is a clown and Im interested to see if Dray calls him one during the playoffs, 😂🤣
Draymond, after you decide to retire, I hope the networks give you a job as a sports analyst. I enjoy listening to your points of view on the game. Very high basketball IQ
This guy can speak 🗣️. Now that’s a fact.
i don't love dray but how can you say a man that wins dpoy doesn't know basketball
BRO PLEASE NEVER EVER RECORD ONE REBOUND IN YOUR GREAT CAREER AGAIN - A DRAYMOND GREEN FAN , From them Spartan Days
It’s so cute Rogan wanting to defend that turd.
Your ass out of here here
Jordan poole distraction
We gonna Whoop that Trick Tonight. Go Dubs
"understand the game".....put a ball in a hoop tall person . Is this guy talking about himself? Put lie detectors on G.S. players  and see if they like him. Trade Brooks for him,bet they would do it.
My biggest regret isn't being suspended from game 5 but being suspended from game 5 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
Idgaf what anybody says ja plays in small ahh hood ahh Memphis Tennessee , he better tote that heat up there
Ain’t this brotha Rich… what’s up with the ads 😂😂😂😂
🔥🔥Clownball 2023🔥🔥
What do I think of Dillon Brooks? I don't. Couldn't pick him out if there was only one person to choose from.
Tonight 🍿
Draymond you are so intelligent.  I love you guys. In as far as you all should win, the only thing is everyone should be on the same accord. You guys already know how to win. You are the mighty warriors. I am sick and tired of nay sayers talking about you all . Make a lie out of them. I Steph did last season.  Peace, and believe.
Dray needs shut up....he ain't Rodman. King of the triple single. Steve Kerr needs to grow a pair and get rid of the cancer . Rode Steph's and Thompson's jock enough already.
Big up yute
You give a good speech  you   Punched your team mate in the face  and you play dirty at times  Really
Grizzlies are literally like to 2010 bulls just more immature star in ja and Dillion acts like Noah 😂 but nothing defensive about him just commits hard fouls and techs
FYI  Quite frankly was the name of Stephen A Smith first show
You need a lav mic. Nothing wrong with it, but the big ass mic gives me 80s reporter vibes 😆
Change the name of the show to "quite frankly " with draymond green 😂
Draymond "Quite Frankly" Green
Dray was almost right like 99% I live in the Bay Richmond to be exact and where he was wrong was he said when he said “When you contribute to winning 4 championships they tend to like you “ but The Bay/ Warrior fans don’t like Draymond Green so he did get that comment wrong. The Warrior fans in the Bay we all Love Draymond Green. My 92 year old grandma loves Draymond Green I am not making this up I swear to god my grandma yells at the TV Calm down Draymond he is her favorite player on her favorite team
"We wouldn't ask why a rose that grew from the concrete for having damaged petals. In turn, we would all celebrate its tenacity, we would all love its will to reach the sun." -Tupac Shakur
Who would have thought draymond would have most rational and introspective insight on this matter….. probably TNT.  That’s why he has a career after his career. Great job
DRAY your 3months of podcast hours took away from your GYM TIME Drop the mic n win 10 straight road games.
🤣🤣🤣....killed Dillon wanne be bad Brooks
Sheesh violated that fool
Damn how many “quite frankly” did you count?  Quite frankly I lost count. Got to love Draymond though for being frank.
I Honestly think it's injuries.
DRAY  your podcast is more successful than your road games so please drop 🎤 n get back in the gym like KOBE so you can get another defense of the year n 5th ring. You're sitting on the job.
If you don't know... now you know.
"One less than your dumbass"🤣
Oh the antagonistic turned crybaby D green
Stop worrying about outside noise and focus on why your team- as defending Champions- are one of the WORST TEAMS on the Road. Focus on why you're throwing tantrums and quitting on plays. Focus on why the team defense is absolutely horrendous. We could make a LONG LIST of your mistakes On and Off the Court Draymond. This is beneath you SMH.
Dray, to be honest, grace is good. But anyone else would have been fired…
“Quite frankly” 😂
the clowns of the league are:   1) grizz: brooks & ja >> addressed by dray here. dynasty? they have to win one first. > warriors shut them down last year amidst all the disrespect and dancing  2) suns: book & Payne > yet another massive disrespect, bragging that they were the best team because they were top seed last year > luka shut them down during the playoffs > "everybody acts tough when they're up."  3) minny: towns & russell (ex) > really celebrated the play-in "championship". wtf??
Bruh u hit a nigga in the nuts 😂 n punch yo own teammate… that’s really not that bad u can throw a lil shade he doing shit that bosses don’t do he slipped n u should’ve been a lil bit more aggressive Cuh da nigga tripping …
Dillon Brooks was gathered quickly in this podcast 🤣🤣🤣
Draymond might get a  tech tonight and golden state well win
Draymond not for his shooting but his Dillon Brooks take was accurate.
Quite Frankly I knew Draymond Green wouldn’t take the smack talk from a dude who looks like Dr. Neo Cortex from Crash Bandicoot 😂
Didn’t you judge Dillon Brooks just on that show and destroyed him?
No one would have to tell someone to take their money or livelihood away. In the real world, it just happens.   Normal people pay for their mistakes. If some guy was working for UPS was caught on video flashing a gun at a night club, you don’t think they would fire him?  In the real world, Ja Morant should be arrested. But he isn’t because of who he is.  By not severely punishing him, they’re sending a message to the entire world that it’s fine. You get suspended a couple of games. No big deal. While the kid, who idolizes him, decides bringing a gun to school is a cool thing to do because he wants to be like Morant. And Morant didn’t really get into trouble so he won’t.  That’s why I feel he needs to be set an example of.
Anyone with an eye can tell brooks is a dirty player just go look up the Donovan Mitchell an Dillon brooks altercation an see what Mitchell says about him … you’ll understand what I’m talking about 💯smh 🤦🏽‍♂️ no respect for that ishhh
Common folk. Us common folk are not idiots to bring a gun in a club. Us common would have been searched before we got in there. Us common folks would have been arrested on the  spot. So don’t compare us common folks to the U.  Us common have to worry if we walk out house.  So stop it  Us common if we waved a gun at any club would probably get shot.
The dude doesn’t want to see people get injured but kicks opponents in privat area
As you are still an active player, focus on playing basketball.
The triple single king has spoken😫Only reason you have 4 chips is because of  steph and klay🤣
Draymond I think you are confusing success with talent
holy fuck he slaughtered Dillion Brooks
Regardless how people feel about brooks he told the truth no one would be mentioning draymond name of he was on another team.  He was lucky too be on the team with steph and klay
Draymond should have addressed what Brooks said by stating facts instead of calling him an idiot. He let Brooks get underneath his skin.
Draymond ‘Quite Frankly’ Green
Draymond mentioning the mental tuffness as a unified collective helps me appreciate the greatness of the 73-9 team and the bulls 72-10 team even more…
Normal people are going to jail Dray.
Dray is very wise and has shared some really good points, along with a great roast lol! that being said when I watch him on court, I don't see that wise, controlled, knowing what to do side of him and I wish I would. If you're going to talk the talk, you gotta walk the walk
I need the exact number of quite franklys
Dillon dynasty Brooks just plan jealous Draymond and the warriors because they haven’t won anything yet look at their records and who’s catching with them
2 most unlikable players going back and forth i love it
Superb podcast 🎉
I like draymond green. But really ubare speaking in the same things you do. Yes u won rings. Thanks to lay and curry. And yes u play defense ans you are roll player. You count lead a team to a championship. But u are also afraid of the media and throw tantrums during a game. And also play dirty I think he should kinda chill on the talking.
Dray anchored the Warriors defense in those dominant runs to the finals and championships which were top of/or best defense in the league
Love it
Well spoken bruh!!!
game 5 nba final how bron walks over green intentionally to get green a tech is second most disgusting act from bron beside his habit of joining teams with superstars, aint no fan of bron 4ever.
Drymond,  I want to see more of your volleyball moves at your opponents net. Very cool.
Grown Man- Having Hissy Fit! 😂 either go out there and play I could like you supposed to or just just just don’t play at all just sit on the bench. You can be Replace, watch your 6!!!
As I read the comments it trips me out how a lil of everyone is coming at dray about walking off like he did but didn't have that same energy when Steph threw his mouth piece, just being real Poole has the tendency to ball hog and it gets frustrating
Yall don't win because you fukd up the CHEMISTRY
Dude talks through his nose.
Another great segment
fkn roasted brooks he was on point too memphis talks to damn much for never having won anything 🙄
The next face of the nba will be a foreigner
Stop saying quite frankly, you're proving your vocabulary selection is slim to none.
I am not going to kick a man when is down, and I am not excusing his actions.  I sincerely pray for Ja,  who has been gifted by GOD to be a good basketball player, and the potential to become a HALL OF FAMER.  Get it together and get rid of that spirit of pride along with that big ego of yours, focus on what's ahead.  We all make mistakes, I pray that God would bring people in his life that truly are out for his well-being as a person and not just for his fame or money.  He needs people that are going to tell him when he is wrong and stop coming into agreement with his foolishness. Praying for you Ja and by the way Jesus Christ is the answer for whatever ails you. He will never leave or forsake you. Let go of the pride, you know what pride stands for (P.R.I.D.E.  Please Remember I Destroy Everything)  and (E.G.O. stands for Edging Got Out)  Don't leave God out..............................................03/09/23
Dillon Brooks and his team talks alot to have won nothing literally… Their just the new generation that troll through the internet for attention instead of producing for attention
Dillion Dynasty Brooks
I don't wanna hear shit from Draymond after he gave up on that play when pool didn't want to throw him the ball. Baby ass
Everybody keeps speaking about the Poole situation but everybody tends to forget how Steph and Klay both threw tantrums this season alone because of Poole not passing the ball. It’s passes like those that would dismantles teams, their defense and also establish the warriors offense that we know and love. Just because of the practice incident everybody loves the blame draymond even more than they already did for everything, which is pathetic lol
His real name Clarence
Thanks for speaking out against cancel culture
I have zero issue with what Draymond had to say about Dillon...but the greatest irony to me is they're the same player...or in the same mold of player. And without realizing he admits as such, his greatest regret is giving his naysayers the ammo to say you can't trust him...this is the same shit Grizzlies fans said about Dillon the last two seasons. The dirty player allegations, the triple single jokes, he's vital to what GS does but he's aware of his role meanwhile Brooks never has, that's the only difference.
You threw a temper tantrum on the floor because the guy you punched only months ago wouldn’t pass you the ball
I have 25 fantasy teams and Dillion Brooks isn't on any of them, however I do have you Draymond. Brooks turns the ball over to much, to many fouls, bad FT %, low FG%, no assist, no blocks. Brooks has to many negatives to be on ay if my fantasty teams, I took Slow Mo above him Kyle Anderson who does a lotto be moving so slow. Thanks D
Horrible passing.............Matador-Defense.............Fear of making a 2-pt basket.  No fear of missing  every 3-pt shot.   Lack of effort to start games.  I live & die by the Warriors; but half-assed play never won a Championship.
“Dynasty starts after you not with you,” is definitely a bar. And Green contributed to all those championship teams. I will say that!
I ouite frankly love his show
Quite frankly
I don’t like Draymond all the time, but his shade and comebacks are top tier 😂😂😂😂
Not blaming Poole but I'm blaming Poole lol. Every warrior has had that moment with him, Curry even got ejected.
Warriors are just a bunch of Sillicon Valley spoil bitches! They won their 1st title against an injured Cavs then got punked out and went and got Durant to help them win! Finally they wont a decent title last year after drafting while at the bottom of the league! Worst franchise! They are like the Man City of the NBA.
So you're saying his stupid behaviour isnt the issue... but the fact that people can say something about his behaviour, is? Shows how warped your sense is. He raised a basketball player who clearly has major character flaws. Just because he plays ball and makes a bunch of money does not mean he is doing good.
Leave race card out and good take
I love you Dreymond what you’re saying is all facts but don’t fall for the dupe. You should go at the reporter asking unnecessary questions as well
Ja n t Morant🤔 good vibes like ur input..👍 from u...Dillon brooks vibes too...I'm like him to golden state warriors..I'm a hater for ur team.. especially u n curry..y would I like u all on the court .I'm a mj fan..that hurts being punished on the court..,🥺but off the court u n curry is at the top of my list for inspiration.. definitely was expecting to woop u all this year championship but ja told us we're good in the west and he would cook mj..now I think Steph good in the west and he can't cook mj with a tool..ja is my new mj so I'm hoping he makes a better come back..stay blessed golden state..🤔
When it rains it pours 😂
BOTH of y’all niggas ass 😂😂😂😂 I can’t believe this argument; 2 trash players and one talking like he was the culprit of 4 rings 🙄 foh draymond lol smh
Draymond ..You are brilliant. Well said about Ja, We all make mistakes.. People need to stop wanting is job to be taking away from him. Would you like that to be done to you.
It's because you knocked out Poole.
Brooks "might" be smart enough to be setting Draymond up to get ejected, which will hurt GSW more than Brooks being ejected. Brooks will talk a lot of trash and my guess is he will be extremely physical with Draymond hoping to get under his skin enough to cause an ejection.
Tee Morant did his job like you said, but he be out there trying to be a star like his son too...
I don’t get the Draymond love train, he’s a huge jerk who kick people in the nuts and punches teammates, throws teenage female tantrums towards the Refs and ran Kd out of town trying too bully him, Draymond should be canceled but keep getting Subway commercials? 😒 Y’all can keep supporting this Azz hole but I’m not and no I’m not a Grizzlies fan
I think you're just a diva and you're jealous of Jordan Poole once you go somewhere else noone will care about your ass anymore
Common folk arent role models to milions of kids..So that cant apply here man. When you at your level you have a responsibility to carry yourself differently.
PLEASE expand your vocabulary to beyond “quite frankly” JESUS CHRIST
Draymond went in!🤣
I love you Dramon 😍
wise words with draymond, but was anyone else not able to stop looking at the zit on his forhead
Saginaw HARDHEADS “BV”🥷🏼 Lol smmfh What fite dis 🤡 bn in in the “NaW” 🥜 kicker boot 👅 licker…. D’s fools wtf is “common folks”? Oh broke ppls… shits KKKRAZY, D’s clowns don’t major in journalism B4 GOIN PRO so NOW THER TAKING UP JOBS FROM others who goes to school for years majored and needs THEM JOBS… GOTDARN SHAME YALL make $10’s of millions of dollars and then y’all TAKE THE JOBS AWAY FROM THE UNDERDOGS🤑🤑🤑🤫 ooh my bads it’s entertainment, Shaq don’t has the voice 2B on TV or radio… Shannon Sharp talks wit a hisp his tongue folds, Day’Day oh wow, bro wuts the white foam around yo lips bro? My pit🦮does dat 😳🤫🤫🤫 it’s VERY 👻of U dudes
Wait... As a regular person, If i waved a gun on my IGand my work found out i WOULD lose my job and livelihood. Especially if many people found out i may not get work from many places i dont agree with that take. Ja needs at least punishment so he learns something and it sets a precedent for others
Every year he won DOPY Tony Allen should have won and you should have never been and allstar bro
DG 👄 is bigger than his game
To make things even JP should get to cold cock him one good time. Now, play 🏀
Draymond has really earned my respect over the years I’m a big lebron fan and used to hate seeing golden state win every year when they had that super team, but I’ve come to realize Draymond and Curry pretty chill dudes.
I like how draymond didn’t just bash ja I know he tripping but shit like this will get through more then people calling him soft and he’s not like tht
Yes, this shouldn't be the end for Ja morant, but draymond is out of touch, at 13:12 cancel culture affects everyone and it sucks, it's not just a target on nba players that people try to get fired. there was a teacher that people were trying to get her fired b/c she tweeted rap lyrics from a song when she was 14, it's not just nba players
Holy hell he just tore this man apart
Damn Dray gave some great advice
There's windows of opportunities for the Warriors to get back to the top of the West.  The Mavs, Suns, Lakers, and Grizzlies all have their leading players out for a minutes.  I hope the Warriors take advantage of these cracks in the wall of making it back to the finals.  The lakers are on your heels and they are taking this run seriously.
Yo gonna get this podcast
Great take down of Dillon Brooks. It is too bad this won't lead to him being humble.
Dude you quit on your team because you didn’t get the ball. Take a seat.
What does success mean to a father? Watching his son gain financial wealth, or watching him make the correct decisions as a morally sound man? Tee Morant raised a successful son in terms of his salary, but he completely failed to instill strong set of values. If your 24 year old son is on the internet waving a gun in a club, you have failed in many important aspects of fatherhood.
Damn Draymond u dragging Dillon all over your podcast lol 😆
Why are you addressing other people mistakes but never our own clown
Draymond is so incredibly great . He is extremely undersized yet he plays against giants successfully. I do not root for Warriors but I have the utmost respect for Mr Draymond Green!!
Belief isn't based on logic that's why nobody cares even if you get proven innocent. You can believe anything whether it's real or unreal. That's why movies get us emotional. The nervous system is believing it.
Defense wins games dray you know that🤦🏾‍♂️‼️🤣😂 y’all defense is not right if you ain’t getting no stops out there plus y’all need a legit big man to protect the rim you need help on defense brother no cap and I’m on the outside looking in you should be telling Dede se after every steph shot lol
Ja will be alright IF he feels the motive to be careful. Emotion promotes behavior until it is habit.
Cancel culture exist because of lack of empathy. Empathy is a choice alot of the times. You can go in your mind and connect to what it would feel like. You have to feel it. It you dont feel it, that's not empathy. If everyone lived life without emotions we'd all be perfect or nothing at all. You have to alter yourself in a chemical way.
The way he carries himself in the court vs how he's here is so unique, he sounds so calm and collective here.
😂Dray got me feeling like that lady always in the background of a fight screaming "Stop it, just leave him alone Draymond! He's had enough! Stop!"
Checkmate 😂😂😂
“Quite frankly, if I’m being quite frank about things, frankly put, Dillon Brooks is frankly an idiot…quite frankly.”
The warriors play the grizz tonight yeah? Lol. I love seeing GS body the Grizz
Curry carried u for those rings 🤣. He even carried you last finals as a 34 year old 🤣. If you was on a average team no one would even know who u are
@12:17 "ahhh you not a champ" damn 🤣🤣
Drey if dillion brooks wasn't talking nobody would be talking about him😂 And now there star messing up too... jaren jackson has an opportunity to step up more and he got the skills to do so.
Brooks response alone was worth the watch 😂
Grace for guns! Wise message Dray.
I'ma warriors fan but for some reason Dre's opinions doesn't mean as much as it use to.. times are uh changin'
1:37 it will change in the post season. It's your teams thinking. Playoffs will force you to focus your thoughts and in doing so the stray thoughts found on the road wont be there.
Dray hit the mark on Tee he is absolutely right about tht guy he did his job praises 2 Tee
It could be worse.. jah could do the Gilbert arenas or the shawn kemp
When common folks make mistakes they lose their jobs
Well said Draymond
Please give us a statement about your 8 year old like temper tantrum
He is totally right on Dillon Brooks. I felt Brooks cost the Grizzlies a chance to beat the Warriors in the playoffs. He plays dumb basketball, goes one on one and takes ill-advised shots. He also has a dumb mentality. I said to myself as long as he is a key member of the Grizzlies rotation, they don't have a chance of competing for a championship.
I don’t care for Dre but this podcast is good!
😭 you was a kid watching us win 😂 👌🏾
Lmao, he is right about D. Brooks being a fkn idiot!!🤣🤣
"Villian" Brooks is stupid, quite frankly. There is no better way to motivate a struggling road game team than to talk trash about them right before you are going to play them.
Great success after the basketball to the hole Warrior's team. I stopped watching in early December. I think Wiseman was a big let down, sucks he got hurt. Glad to hear GP2 came back but really don't think it's the Warriors yr. You guys were fun to watch and I'm glad you beat Boston. Also congratulations on all the Championships those were fun years.
You gave up on the play with okc. Not a good look for a veteran like you.
Take a shot every time draymond says Quite frankly ..
Everything was cool until your racism.
Do anyone think Draymond will be on GS...next session?
Quite frankly….
"you ask yourself the question, Can your Dad control everything you do Now as a Grown Man?" Intelligent Question from Draymond on Ja situation, as much as I Think this young Bull throwing away his Accomplishments, I also think bruh is Young with Money and he's lost in the moment and doesn't know how to control and conduct the Circus. Ultimately he's a grown man now so the only way he can learn is through trial and error/the hard way. Can't Blame his Father he's done all he can to get his son out. 💯
Quite frankly x100
Lazy was the tantrum you threw when Jordan Poole didn’t pass you the ball…
I agree with the ja morat segment of this brother. No black father slander will be tolerated
I never thought there would be a beef that made me take Draymond’s side 😂😂😂. He didn’t hold back on that 🤡
Love the diss on brooks, but it's quite a hoot holding fans who work for ten dollars an hour or less to the same standard as 40 million a year athletes..Sure, draymond, we'll ask grace for these greedy, spoiled, primadonnas..Nah, don't think so..Or for your attempt to bleed our hearts for injured superstars..They get the best medical attention in the world including operations and rehab, all the best massages, whirlpools, dieticians etc. while continuing to collect ridiculous salaries..The rest of us dare not see a doctor or go to the hospital for fear it will bankrupt us...Give it up..You've got a pretty damn cushy life, homie..BTW, no excuse for our abysmal road record and that includes you not driving to the basket more..You use to own the lane, now you kick the ball out of of it like a sissy..As the joker asks in the Dark Knight, "What happened, your balls drop off?" Since we're being frank, you haven't played great since your podcast started..Maybe you should take a break from it like klay did from his boat...Worked wonders for him..Just sayin'..Go Warriors!
People dont realize this but draymond does nothing as well as dillon brooks he just got in a lucky system and I dare anyone to challenge me
Damn Draymond went IN on D Brooks
How many championships? I don't think you mentioned it.
Such weird dudes. An example of what money does for guys nobody would check for. As a matter of fact nobody in they right mind looks up Dillion Brooks and Draymond green highlights........
Why you not connect the energy between Brooks and Ja? Its a mentality both losers have.   Btw, ja should be out the league, he can get a job at the mall to buy diapers
Damnt dray I wanna give you some new media clout but when you say quite frankly 7 times before the 8 min mark I can’t take you seriously
Draymond is intelligent, courageous, mixed with wisdom.
bum draymoond
"Hey! Keep quiet and let Draymond cook for fuck sakes!!!"
That’s good Dray! You nailed the advice to Ja!
dray why u deflectin blame of road win L's.
"Next time you speak up on me, you should do some soul searching"
Quite Frankly 🤷🏾‍♂️
Well spoken!! Nobody is perfect!! Loved the grace extension! Need you to talk to my child Draymond
One of the most overrated players of all time .
If every NBA player watches the Draymond podcast everyday. The battle for that Ring will be crazy. The whole NBA will be playing with passion💪🙏💯
This guy is way to locked in to the term, "QUITE FRANKLY".... Enough bro.
I hear you bro! When you talk about jobs and regular people. It’s not our fault you are an NBA player who get paid millions, I’m sorry my Applebees boss doesn’t care I flashed a 22 on IG. And ja didn’t even get in trouble I know mf who got booked off takin pics with Guns
Quit ducking the media
I normally don’t agree with this guy but he is spot on.
I hate this entitled POS
My first time watching. I love it Draymond! Better than durst take and undisputed.
Young brother Ja (I'm giving grace) Understand you are not in the streets you make over $200 million you have a chance for generational wealth.  Listen up young brother take some advice from some real O G's(T Morant continue to put that pressure on your son with  💌💌💌💌💌💌
Draymond you said it best, your resume speaks for itself. You can talk all the trash you want in my opinion. 4 time Champ, let that sink in Dillon. And Stephen A dropped jewels as well.  The mic was dropped on first take as Stephen A followed up on the show this morning.  RESULTS SPEAKS VOLUMES AND WORDS ARE MEANINGLESS WITH OUT THE RESULTS.
Earth to Ja, the same ninjas you trying to impress, laugh at you behind your back for being stupid.
impressed
dumb and entertaining content. Morant should be punished, I hope they take 2 mil from him, no reason to send him to jail. So lets see if he will behave like an idiot next time
Poole did your ass how you did KD ... Control your damn emotions , big fella😂
I grew up exactly where Ja grew up from, that environment is definitely like that.......ignorant....plus we have Shaw Air Force Base spraying those chemicals in the sky over so called black areas all the time.
BooM 💥💥💥 And dropp the Mic 🎤 lol
Frankly is he being frank
Great episode…great advice King
Ja is old enough to understand not to do these things. Most of us at 17 know not to do those type of things
Here for the Grizzlies PACK. GS by 40 tn
Draymond “quite frankly” Green
Good talk Draymond, coming from the heart, reach the heart. We all have messed up. It is grace that we all need. Not saying we should keep getting grace, but hopefully we will learn from our mistakes and become better citizens despite the corruption in our leaders around the country.
He always sounds like something is stuck in his nose.
If this isn’t the pot calling the tea kettle black I don’t know what is lol
Draymond killed brooks 💨 😂
Dillon Brooks may want to start a rap battle with Eminem next.
“Guns in this country been a big issue”  Is not just guns. Is the PEOPLE!  If a person doesn’t pick up a gun and shoots/ kills someone, the gun will not go do it all on its own.     If people were using bats to kill people then we would say we have a bat problem?   Is people, plain and simple. Mental health, and other factors.
Hey grey mondgreen I am Lakers fan but I do have respect  for you
Hi Draymond - blessings to you.  Man, when I watch you and the team roll and things are clicking, I'm not going to lie - it's amazingly fun to watch..  I don't hear people talk about it a lot but the energy and effort you bring in just how you run up the court on a break is awesome to see.  I just want to say here though that you, and myself, can do better.  Specifically, with our words.  I know the temptation is real to want to lay into someone who's saying things about you.  I can want to do it too.  But things start sinking down into lower levels when we respond in the same way that someone else comes at us.  No good comes of it often.  May both you AND I be better men.  You have a great platform here, Draymond.  I appreciate your hard work and effort on and off the court when it comes to working your tail off.  But don't let the anchor of people's actions and words bring you down to a level that's not beneficial.  I think there's layers to this Youtube thing.  The professional and elite, albeit certainly still imperfect at times, stay above the fray.  I have confidence in you, Draymond.  May you and I BOTH be ones who stay above the fray.   - Blessings.
“He’s in a position that’s just enough to choose the path other than being the face of the NBA”. Absolutely fucking right.
The grizzlies think they are a dynasty? Lol. How many championships to you have? The people of Memphis are insane if they think Brooks and Morant are getting them a championship.
Dillon Brooks is an idiot, Ja is out here making dumb decisions, the Grizzles proving how young, dumb and immature they are. Ja had potential to be the face of the league, but is fumbling it because he wants to be a gangsta.
Quite frankly & incredible lol
dramon keeps bringing up trophies like he’s eleven years old. I guess when that’s all you got it’s what you have to go with.
Keep doing your thing. Luv the the show..👏👏
Ja: “Im so Gangsta holding a gun in a club”.  Shawn Kemp: “Im at a mall, hold my beer”
I’m a Memphian and we don’t care for Dillon that much. Seems like a decent guy, but his defensive ability does not make up for his inefficiency on the offensive end. Chris Vernon a well respected local heralded journalist beat the table for you after watching your draft workout here. Not being a turncoat because I ride for my Grizz just stating FACTZ. We still Whoopin a Trick G
Got floor seats for the game tonight, can’t wait
Jesus is coming Jesus he loves you he came and died for our sins you can repent and accept him as your lord and savior  remember we are not going to live for ever  what are you going to say when you go befor him guys hell is real you don't want to spend youre eternity in hell burning and saying if only i would have accepted Jesus as my savior come to his arms he is waiting for you!!!! i love you in Jesus name i just want you to be saved God bless you Don't have to respond just think about it he gave us free will so is youre choice if you let him in your heart and let the holy spirit change you life !!!!
That dynasty like so damn disrespectful…. I love it 😂
C'mon now we know that Draymond got lucky to be a part of such a historical team but now that it is all said and done we can not just act like he was sitting on the bench and those rings fell on his fingers he played a pretty big part in those seasons aswell, and he wasn't talking anything prior to that he was just a hungry player. That's what these young dudes don't get you need to prove something first before you just say it. Draymond is talking off of experience while you are just speculating...
Draymond sure does love himself some Draymond!
Daymond green is not deserve to it cuz Golden wins from Curry effect. Without green Golden would win maybe.
Poor dillon brooks🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣☠️
Draymond's biggest regret stems from game 5? Not the punch he gave Poole? ? If I was Poole that wouldn't be good hearing.
Thank you Dray. I said the same thing. People always told me I couldn't be gang related because I was from a small town but my mind and heart was lost to gang mentality. We all make mistakes and that's that.
I just also hopes ja Morant comes back as a better person he's really entertaining to watch and I don't want to see go on the wrong path.🏀
I would encourage Ja and Tee to adopt a mindset of being a change bringer.  When you walk in a room does the atmosphere change or do you fall in line with the current atmosphere?  Imagine if the environment changed when you walked in the club instead of pulling the gun out!  Ask yourself "who am I and whats my purpose?"
Heres a beginnimg of a rivelry sorry for brooks next time you two meeet
Draymond tryna be J Cole in his response
Draymond green was speaking facts and also the thing is the grizzlies keep on poking the bear for opponents to get up for them.🏀
I love that Dillion has become the Villain, They just need to win something first before they talk all that Shiiii
Wow...ok ok. I was annoyed with you startung this shit and refused to give it a try. But after THIS SHIT RIGHT HERE. I'm in. Got DAAAAMN, "You ain't gotta do him like that, thats cold ice cold" but glad you hit him like that. Mf deserves that shit..acting like he a vet but ain't done shit.
😂😂 😂😂😂😂 He don't want u more boy 😂😂😂
Damn Dray get him! haha Love it!
Wow, punching jp isnt your biggest regret? Daaaamn thats cold
Please preach babe 🙏🙏.
Draymond, you meant 4th Pro sports team for Philadelphia to make the championship. Phillies, Eagles, and Union (MLS) all have made it. All have lost as well lol
Lol..Dillon Brooks want the smoke..and he get one 🤣
You're not gonna punch Jordan Poole in the mouth I hope?
No, Miss Karen. I know u guys born JP but he don't needs to address nothing. Tell ur nephew JP to passed the ball and stop thinking he's Steph Curry! Ur white people always feel entitled. Draymond is first ballot hall of Famer. So, he don't owe nobody a godamm explanation! Leave him alone
Give me a break Green. You all make so much money, don't play defense like the older days, get pampered for small injuries and are a bunch of thugs off the streets but still doing street things off camera! Give me a break. Go kick rocks and go back to what you call playing ball!
My god, Draymond, there has to be a limit to your victimhood mentality. Everybody in the media seems to be on Ja's side. They all want him to clean up his act and do better and are giving him the benefit of doubt. They all rooting for him. Just because  some random troll on twitter says he should go to jail or be banned from the NBA, you want to use that to play the victim. Please stop the "Oh, us NBA players have such a hard life" BS. You want to be all benevolent saying you're not going to judge him because you make mistakes. That didn't stop you from wanting Bill Simmons to lose his platform for using one inappropriate phrase on his podcast.
Draymond bruh always was a big fan. But bruh you started that fight with Poole. Then took advantage of that man hands being down and not looking at you as he walk away.Definitely not a brooks fan but he did not lie you would be playing for Tokyo turtles without Steph and klay. Y’all 3 have best chemistry when on floor together. You had one good game in championship games last year. Be humble bro
Draymond “quite frankly”’ green 😂
Sometimes when i hear him talk about his achievements i wanna hear him mention his teammates..... But then i remember, HE DOESNT HAVE TO! klay, steph, iggy, loon..... even the young ones and his former teammates know this man contributed. Matter of fact, draymond was used to scoring 20 or 30 points in playoffs when steph got double teamed or klay or durant was injured. Now the last few years with warriors, steph and klay aint the only shooters in the team, everybody shooting the 3..... this lead to draymond dishing out, setting screens, reading the floor AND handling the defence more than him looking for some points. The man is the only 6'6 forward stopping centers and forwards 7 ft tall when hes on his game.  no one stops an embiid a jokic or a giannis when they in the zone.... but draymond uses every tool in his toolbox including fouls to keep them under 30 points if he can so they start dishing out to their less lethal teammates. And because he is the only 6'6 with the grit, power and intelligence to slow down all star caliber 7 fters, its even more impressive that he can lock down most small ball players also. THAT is more the reason he can talk so big, not just the 4 rings because that involves a team. dont look at boxscores for draymonds impact, watch the games, hear his teammates talk about him......  im out.
You and your perspectives are larger than life. You are fair in your take, assertive when needed. May you continue to make a difference in your team, other players, fans and everybody in general. I don’t know what’s going on internally with Warriors, but as a team who achieved greatness, may you find a way to make a difference again. Greatness is achieved by standing and going thru adversities, it’s not a cakewalk. There’s a job to be done somewhere, and I trust you will find and do what gotta to do. Cheers!
As a father, your job is never over. I don't agree the ideology of a kid being grown because he's over a certain age. I bet if Mom said don't do that, the grown man is suppose to listen according to many men who only grew up with Mom.
he right about tee. we don’t know what tee is doing and saying behind the scene
“Some fans have a deeper understanding of the game but the majority are like the media…just really lazy”
4:55 "Never wanna see anyone get injured"    Steven Adam's nuts and J. Poole's jaw entered the chat
Draymond’s new media is just a bunch of cry baby’s 😂
YOU NEED TO BE REPLACED ON THE WARRIORS💯
Greens back peddling.
Kid!!!!!
This dude averaging 4 and 6 talking crazy.
Wise words from Draymond. If I'm Brooks, I'm looking deep in the mirror and should realize to stfu.  no rings no dynasty, no finals appearances etc. You're a solid player on a deep Memphis team just hoop and stop running your mouth, there's a reason why your team is falling apart quickly.
Giving him grace might lead to someone getting killed, Dray.
owned brooks sorry ass 😂
Green sounds corny.
Trust me Mr. Green, NBA players already get big breaks compared to the average citizens. To ask for even more is understandable but also laughable 😂. Good show though, keep doing your thing
Quite Frankly
The Draymond 'quite frankly' Green show
Bruh I used to HATE Bruce Bowen then it was Draymond but Dillan Brooks, Grayson Allen, and Ja Morant are catching up fast. Memphis scouting is a complete mess.
Draymond is the heart of Golden state warriors. The warriors won’t win a championships without the dog. Draymond is that dog. Dillon want to be that defender as draymond so he hates. Draymond you are my dude.
Get off Draymonds Dick. He punched someone in practice who was talking shit to him. Wrong or right shit happens and there is nothing he can say or do to change the situation. He will pay for his actions in one way or another. Stfu
Brotha, you were a roll player on championship team. 100 other players could have filled your roll bro. You’re the get away driver at a bank robbery.
Draymond you should stop talking your a selfless kid who needs a attitude adjustment your play on the court doesn't equal your kiddy ass attitude grow the fuck up
Like your comments bout ja, I need to give more love, and grace, I can be a a hole sometimes
Draymond, please, lock Dillon Brooks' and the Grizzlies' asses later. I want to see the DPOY Draymond that we're accustomed to watching. I want to see Dillon get frustrated on every possession. I want to see some great defense and offense out there later. Whether you guys win or not, I want to see that! But I do hope that you'll try your best to win. We need this!
Told that boy Dillon to do "some soul searching" before you speak on me again. Say Dray, I didn't like or dislike you because I never researched you before. I am a Sac Kings fan. Either way Bro, I have always respected you and admired you from afar. Now the more I hear you talk I can really relate to your POV. Proud of you Brother! Much love and have a great post season!
As a lifelong warriors fan going to games in the 70’s and 80’s with my father watching the J.B. Carrolls and Purvis Shorts of the world. Draymond came into the league as a hungry humble guy playing behind Lee and has become a fantastic hall of fane basketball player. From a fan’s perspective though I have as much respect for him as he does for fans. As much as fans are just tools to fuel the warriors home wins, Draymond is the same to me I despise most things about his personality (he’s a great person he says while a few months ago sucker punching a young teammate) Draymond is only a tool to get Championships for the team I’ve loved longer than Green has been alive. His ego is off the charts these days just keep winning and us ignorant fans want you. As soon as you decline please go.
Great advice to Ja🙌🏽🙌🏽
Love listening to  Draymond… solid guy… I need to find out how to listen to his podcasts
DRAY and Unk Shay has the best podcasts out. Hope they get the recognition they deserve
Man, I just love this guy, Draymond Green. I am from Timor-Leste and had been a fan of GSW since 2008. I had been waiting for Draymond to respond to this clown and so happy and satisfied with his response.
@Draymond do you think flight travel has an affect on your play on teh road/ Last year were ya'll arriving to the next state you play in earlier than hat you are now or maybe you guys should arrive an hour earlier to see if that helps
You can't give up period Draymond you is one of the leaders of the team can't let nobody throw you off 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆💪💪💪💪💪💪💪 WARRIORS 🥰🥰🥰🥰💜🥰
Green with the Chris Rock plug after that Netflix special?
Flat-out savage. 🔥
Guess punching out Jordan Poole wasn't regrettable
What Draymond is missing is that my father also raised a successful black man and the last thing I would do is let my dad see me waving a gun around shirtless in a club. I’d be ashamed of myself facing my father after something like that. Draymond might think Tee did his job because Ja is a millionaire in the NBA but the size of your fame and bank account obviously don’t speak to who you are as a man.
Well I just wanna say as a grizz fan I love Dillion brooks 〽️〽️〽️🐻🐻🐻 we want all the smoke still
I don’t understand why the opinions of fans always get discredited. Some fans do understand the game very well. Never understood why old AND new media resorts shit like this just to make points.
brooks got fried 😂
Why can’t it just be he raised a successful young man just in general? Why is there always race thrown into the mix? Saying stuff like this continues to be the dividing factor in our country. I know you didn’t mean anything about it but we need to unite instead of always making it out to be black and white.
You quit on your team...and you supposed to be a leader....new media gonna address that?
Everytime Draymond says "Quite frankly" take a shot..
THAT TEE MORANT SEGMENT IS A JOKE 😂😂 his dad is a clown just like his son
oh man......  you didn't have to dis Team Canada.  come on.
One thing I disagree with is the normal people comment.  Athletes get away with more than normal people. Avoiding jail time for things normal people would have to do time for.  On point with everything else.
Used to really dislike Dray back in the days...one of my fav players nowa days , what an intelligent man , love his breakdowns and takes on all game related stuff. Keep it great work my man , God bless
Oh I know the answer it's because Draymond Green decided now to be a YouTuber instead of a basketball player. Just like Oscar De La Hoya's when he decided to be a singer and realize he wasn't a good singer then he went to try the Box again and got his ass totally kicked.
Dillon ain't good enough to talk the shit he does
Great job
Who's asking for Ja's livelihood to be taken away? I haven't heard anything to that effect.
Ja Morant is the GOAT
Draymond spoke some facts definitely wasn’t holding back
Tbh I jut don't like when current players talking on other current players annoys me beyond belief. If you retire fair enough, but whilst your competing it just seems corny.
On the FLIP side Draymond... sometimes "Grace" = the fall and the reemergance...  at some point these young dudes got to look and understand the position where you are, how you got there, and have the foresight to map out where you're going INTENTIONALLY... And for you sir EAT THE FOOD YOU"RE SERVING here.
My question is why don't you play hard against the lakers anymore? You used to be the thorn in Lebrons side and it seems like since you all became homies you just don't play hard against him anymore and I've watched you closely. I'm from Michigan bro so I follow you closely.
The “look at this idiot right here” part have me LOL in the office
His fcking Dad is too busy trying to be a damn celebrity instead of raising his son PROPERLY!!!!
Man called us all commoners 🤣  Man said “i believe im a really great person” 😂😂😂😂 cant listen to dude talk for more than 10 mins man he such a female spirit lol
Draymond a joke
QUITE FRANKLY
When are you gonna punch poole again
Hearing draymond of all people address this is pretty funny
Draymond’s comments on Jah are some of the most authentic commentaryvI’ve heard about anything in a long time.😊
Wanted to hear Draymond speak on the JP situation/play. Great episode tho, put Dillon Brooks in his place 😂
retire next year dray. concentrate on your podcast. this is where you are effective. and to tell you frankly, your show it the greatest thing that happened to your life.
Dray speaks nothing but facts
When people in general wave a gun in public. They go to jail.
Did you punch Poole again after he didn't pass you the ball, or are you just kicking people nowadays?
If they don’t smoke the grizzlies 😂😂
stop lol , its not ja
Let's not forget that without Dray, the Warriors are not winning these 4 chips. I thought that was crystal clear from a fan's point of view, obviously that's not the case from Dillon's. Really tells you everything you need to know about him.
They just have to play a little threatened and forget about stats and let everyone touch the ball often the quick shots mess with the flow unless someone is hitting they need to move it and eventually they can get layups they are at their best when the ball is moving and everyone is cutting and screening. They could have easily won last 2 games if they made a few shots. Everyone work to get Steph Klay and Jordan going and then Kuminga wiggins Donte and Payton with looney and Draymond connecting things
Talk your SHT DREYMOND!!!i AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID HOMIE ON EVERY SUBJECT 💯💯💯straight like dat!!so real!!
I come here to learn more about basketball. Dray is a great teacher.  Even with my fan's knowledge, I understand more than Dillon Brooks.
Mane 12:12 get this mane off podcasts he really talking about what kd steph n klay did Dillion brooks might not have won anything but offensively he’s better than u he might b better defensively too cuz your like a taller version of pat bev u understand defensives but you literally can’t do nun what pf can’t block a shot u can’t cuz u Dillion brooks height 😂 and for your position you literally would get torched by a big man my worst fear is to see y’all n the lakers in the conf finals cuz Anthony Davis will destroy you like always n it’s another trip to the finals for them so plz stop talking like u actually contributed 12% to them 4 titles I’ll give u 10 u set good screens n that’s it 😂
Funny how he gracefully keeps insulting the fans as we are dumb.
Love how he didn’t respond to the part about him being a nobody on another team. That part is very true. Draymond would be another role player.
Love Steph, he's playing great, but ya'll too focused on getting him the ball instead of making the right plays. Give everybody the green light to contribute.
Draymond got good points and his perception of things as a professional athlete…a winner at that but the thing about it is us common folks as he say we would be booked no one has to go to their jobs cuz the law is coming it’s warrants getting put out and all types of affidavits for social media platforms and the club camera footage smh we don’t get second chances or stuff swept under the rug
Dillon Brooks is just trying to make a name for himself I will be honest I am not a huge fan of Draymond, but Dillon Brooks is Not in Dray's league. Instead of talking noise what he should do is Get in The Lab.  You don't have to Dray but ut he does contribute to GSW winning.
Draymond=Trash Dillion: Garbage
Stop sayin “quite frankly” gotta expound the vocabulary as u continue into the new media world
That 17 year old was like 6"6
But the CBA is there for a reason, the punishment is 50 games suspension without pay; Draymond must have selective memory LMAO if he didn't know about Gilbert Arenas haha
1 less than your Dumbass. Lol. Put that on a tshirt
Honestly, that address to Dillon Brooks was epic and I'm not even a big fan of Draymond. It was hilarious and beautifully spoken.
Everyone talking about Ja and his guns, but Dray just killed Dillon. ☠️
Draymond green is mediocre at best and if he was on a subpar team like Houston rockets or the spurs he would be a even more irrelevant. He’s the toughest player on a team full of softies
They don’t like Dillon brooks because no matter who you are in the league Dillon brooks is going to play defense and play chippy which i personally like . All the guys in the league are SOFTIES including Draymond . Y’all can’t talk about dirty plays coarse Draymond known for dirty plays and don’t forget when Za Za did that dirty play ok kawhi that year in the finals and sent him home causing the spurs to get put out
🤙
Ja was stupid; he has to explain why he pressed to go LIVE on Instagram; was he influenced by his cliques? the CBA has a punishment Draymond... which comes with a 50 games suspension; if he didn't press live; people won't find out he carried a gun in the team plane/locker room....
One thing I love about this podcast is the chance to learn more about the game as a fan - I understand now just how little I knew - and I’m grateful this podcast has helped enlighten me. Draymond, you’re a great person who has immense grace for people who might not deserve it. Dub nation’s always got your back bro.
Can’t wait to hear this podcast when he’s not on the warriors next year. Make sure you don’t disappear draymond
Draymond got lucky that's all to it he doesn't know any more than anybody else out there playing
Brooks deserved this one
You're lame ass should get back on defence and not get emotional on the court. You're not lebron
People lose their jobs everyday for bullshit your far disconnected with common people you don’t even realize it anymore
You have made some mistakes--DEVASTATING mistakes--in the past, that the world got to witness, unfortunately.  What I PERSONALLY pay attention to...??  Is, how you treat your Mom :0).  How, she smiles so hard, when she speaks about you.  How, you have done...wayyyyyyy more GOOD, than you've done BAD, young brother.  You keep hooping, PROTECT YOUR NECK, and keep getting that bread and cementing your Legacy, in The Game.  You are ALREADY a Legend.  Dillon...WHO*lmaooo*....................????  ((*Stepping off of my soapbox again, quietly*))...
Draymond you quit bna?
dillon "ringless clown" brooks you better learn to respect a champ...
Dre that’s bs bro u shouldn’t said that bs .. Don’t be sayin us regular people if we get in trouble people don’t run to our jobs an all that bs . MF when something happen to us we gettin more fuckin time then a damn celebrity so I don’t know wtf u talking bout
Leave it on the court you stupid tier 3 clowns.
Damn my respect for draymond just went up the roof, am now a fan green
Not the biggest Draymond fan, but I’m DEFINITELY not a fan of Dillon Brooks. And I’m a die hard Memphis fan. Not a fan of the shit Ja pulling either.
Keep doing you. I lOVE your game.
Nigga focus on your game and stop doing Youtube videos I saw a play where Poole didn't pass you the ball and then he turn the ball over then you quit game play
Farthest thing from a Draymond fan but this was straight facts
I think Dray is such a polarising person. I’m done hearing that he’s the glue that keeps the Warriors together. Oh please. Here is the guy who was responsible for KD leaving, and here is the guy that couldn’t keep it together resulting in a game 5 suspension and causing them a championship, and then more recently sucker punching a young Buck in the face and causing irreparable damage to the locker room. Dhillion Brookes is an Idiot, Draymond is an idiot too but with 4 rings. That’s all
You da man Drey☝🏽 I met you right after you got drafted at the Luckys at Fruitville station in Oakland
Dillion "Big T Energy" Brooks 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Draymond needs to stop saying "quite frankly " so much.
Well spoken, my man.
Hold on, Steph, Klay, Dray, JP, Looney all have championship DNA, Donte as well, there’s really no excuse  Talking abt mental concentration etc is rubbish, there’s more than enough experience on that team to win more than 7-25  Come on, tell us the truth Dray
Sorry man but that take is so delusional. If some regular Joe flashed a gun in a club and put it up on instagram for his peers to see, he'd bee 100% fired almost instantly. H'ed probably be in custody under investigation.
You talk about the next men before you address yourself ?  Come on uncle Dray that’s whack
I don’t want to here any more four rings talk until the dubs act like they are interested in a fifth
Mic Drop!
Quite frankly, quite frankly, quite frankly...
THIS WAS LAZY BY DRAYMOND. VERY LAZY. didnt address his lazy effort n temper tantrum but talking about everything else.  AND THE HUMBLE GUY FROM GREEK who always preaches doing things right way literally tried to stat pad days after Perk comments. LIKE PERK SAY IT'S TRUE BUT IT'S OKAY. Dont know wtf Dray talking abt or JJ. Thought J was cooler than that
Draymond wise man my guy
Let’s address that you average 3 points & need to work on your game
Dillon brooks is the worst offensive player in the league.
If I had a dollar for each time Green said "quite frankly," I'd have a super max contract.
When I see an african-american I always consider him or her as armed and dangerous, always stay ready. Even FBI statistics prove that!
Tell him Dray..tell him..he is a clown who compensates  his poor game by intentionally injuring his opponents
4 rings lil one dilll
Drey this IS SOOOO UNNECESSARY,
It's obvious. Defense. GSW is weak at this in 2022-23.
The reason yall losing is because u punched poole!
Enuf said period. Not sure if this gets read, but at this point of the season, is there any value in trying something outrageous for away games? To a layman like me, it seems like Klay and JPoole play better if they get theirs early and the chances of winning are much higher when both of them play well. Is there any value to start the greatest shooter of all time on the bench and get him to play a Ginobli type of role? Steph is going to get his irrespective and having him with the second unit, will stablise offensive efficiency and hopefully make the game easier for the younger guys due to Steph's gravity. Its less of an issue at the Bay, because it has so much energy. Ppl are going to heap crap on this comment, but Steph is the only SUPERSTAR in the league today that can do this, with similar greatness of Tim Duncan,  putting winning and team first. A true fan, go dubs, hope for another Ring
Breaking news Klay Thompson's father just say the same shit y'all need a big y'all to tiny other teams pg are the same size as gsw centers
I’m glad your spoke to Ja and gave him the real and I hope he comes to realization of the position he is in
RIP Brooks 😂 dray flaming his dumbass
Man I hate Dillon Brooks. But this mf always talks too much out his bum ass
Clowns doesn't work when building a dynasty, TAKE IT FROM ME..... he is sincere.
Money alone dont make a person successful. Ja still a kid wanting to be a g. He sure is dumb and aint grown enough in the head.
He don t want no body to have no more kids either 🦵 🥜 🥊
What team is Draymond moving next year?
It was great to have Steph back  So I can get double digit assist by just passing him the ball everytime he's close to me 😂 Also talking about mental start with you .  Throwing a tantrum like a 12yo because the guy you punched in the face didn't pass the ball to you. Draymond is soooo delusional, Jesus. With Curry ,Klay and Kerr Draymond is nobody.  And we all saw that when Steph and Klay were hurt and instead of you, it was rookies and Gleague guys that were leading the Warriors
I hear you dray! But at the same token? A lot of people don’t make multi millions to play a game for entertainment and that’s not taking anything from you or others! But I feel that would be the sentiment amongst most people! But your right, Ja should be allowed to be forgiven and allowed to grow!!! Love the podcast! Always a Dub and Draymond supporter
That's the calmest yet most ruthless way I've ever seen someone destroy another man 😆Dillon Brooks should know better
The Warriors,  need to bring back the traded people, Shaun Livingston (retired) DeMarcus Cousins, Javale Mcgee, Zaza Pachulia, Kevin Durant (Phoenix Sun, not leaving).... Draymond Green, does have his down faults,  some bigger than others( pool punch, LeBron kick) but he is, who he is, he's been punished, suspended, fined over 1 million, most ever...Ja, acts like a wannabe gangster, or he really is one, maybe  the " alcohol"  brought his true colors out...I don't know him, so I really don't know..I pray, for his daughter sake, he wakes the f u...Don't be a Aaron Hernandez, Javaris Crittenton..GOD, gives us GRACE, which is his "unmerited favor", blessing us, with good things we don't deserve ..MERCY, forgiving the sin..
What’s that big ass bump on yo head?
I have zero sympathy for Ja. He didn't get caught doing something, he flaunted it for everyone on Live like a clown. Doesn't mean he should be kicked out of the league but his stupidity should be called out
Torching his dummaasassss
I wonder if they gon play whoop dat trick at the game 😆
How are you still in the league?
Quite frankly
Draymond green put that little boy in a body bag😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Ur show should be called quite frankly. Lol. Draymond koo wit me. Nuggs in 6 tho.
Draymond quite frankly green
What’s up with these young cats having nothin on they resume but talk a lot. @book
The Show should be called "Quite Frankly!"
Im going to tell you way you guys are loseing  o e you guhs are not playi g defenc the alther one os youer coch is lething  the game  silp alway in tbe frist q by lethi g you guys trail to much point too over co.e and one you guys do over come it you dont have the power to go ahead and take over the game so if you guys dont foul behind so much points you will wiin most off the games  and coch thats just what I think
We don’t like him in Memphis
As a Grizzlies fan that “the dynasty starts after you, not with you.” Line hit different. It’s a real fact no 🧢 😂😂😂
Luka the next face
If ja Morant name was Dillon brooks he would have been released the day the report came out. Just goes to show if your a great athlete you can bring guns to the club.
Draymond is flaming this brooks fool😂
Draymond is flaming this brooks fool😂
If success to you is only about how much money you make, then so be it. But his father is being slandered and that how the world is, Ja knows it as well. Thats why most of the critics were talking about the fact that he put himself in this position, that was going to affect not only him but also his parents! Also, forget about the money, why u re not talking about how he also put himself in danger actinf like a gang member? He can get KILLED and u re not stressing about this enough
Dillon "Dynasty" Brooks
All due respect to Draymond Green!!
Quite Frankly...
Dont like draymond but always respect his game. He absolutely killed Dillon brooks here
Dirty dillon got roasteddd 😂
Looks like Draymond saw the high road on Brooks and said "not today, not ever". Worth the click 😂.
Love your Pod/videos Draymond. When I hear the expression grace I think of the phrase “graceful under pressure”.   This is a process for all of us & we are all on different continuums in regards to this process.   Such as not debating refs. I am not a fan of how our current NBA has utilized reactions to refs to try & influence their future calls. It reminds me of manipulation instead of just playing the game. Just like flopping & “head snaps”.   I will applaud the grace it takes to stay the course through a championship that you have exemplified.   Stay the course on the process to growing your own personal gracefulness under pressure.
You are always going to learn something when you watch this Podcast. Seriously learn something. Don't leave the team Dray!! Stay on board and stamp that statue if front of Chase.
This whole video is a funeral ceremony for Brooks 💀
Bro is roasting the shit outta Brooks 💀
ja said he loves brooks wdym
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯 real shit straight facts you’re right Draymond People need to get off JA Morant’s dick & show him some grace & mercy 💯💯💯💯💯💯🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 pray he makes the right decision
Talk about how you ruined the team Chemistry before the season even started.
ironic calling an nba player a fan. and making fun of a canadian for not having 2 team usa medals lol
Dray,u have enough media /podcast experience now, u must ve relisten to yrself many times enough to not keep using 'quite frankly' 10times in a minute! Salute
They should've let your bum ass go when you disrespected KD like you that guy  Biggest 🌽 ball in the NBA  Biggest mouth in the NBA  Most overrated defender in the NBA  Triple single you won't be missed  They don't love you like that 💯
Low Key Draymond Green Got Accolades  4x nba Champ 🏆 4x nba AllStar 🎖️ DPOY 🔒 x 7x All Defensive  2x All NBA  And led the league in Steals Before, that’s an impressive resume
This guy is a clown. Nobody takes him seriously. He’s the Tim Meadows of the NBA. He’s so lucky to have a job.
U can't help but love draymond. I really love ur take on Ja Morant. God bless u bro!
Drillon Brooks knows just to complain much. full of talk no action at all. He is just the player just add negative stats to the teams full of talks. More negative than positive stats
It’s not him because who in gods name wants a rep of being a “ thug”? Dray you are smarter than that dawg wtf he wasn’t raised where you were , he’s a good kid, got good grades two parent household momma and dad birthed ‘em raised em to be an upstanding citizen not another king von. This kid has potential to be the face of the league brother don’t sell him short by acting like we aren’t tryna help by telling this kid likes Scottie Barnes did Grimes “ you is not himm “ period point blank awful podcast episode.😂🗣️ Focus on winning on the road the thunder ate y’all up maybe y’all on social media alittle too much nowadays I miss when it was 2015 y’all was tryna beat bron no time for podcast 😂😂😂 good days man I miss em
In addition, you guys are missing wiggs badly!
He said when it rains it pours about Dillon Brooks 😂😂😂
Dylan Brooks response "They don't love you like Steph!"
It makes sense... it's called playing defense!!! Stop shooting soooooo many damn 3's and go rack! And stop turning over the ball! And caring!!!
Draymond, of course we don't know me personally HOWEVER we do know and see your history of lack of E.I.(Emotional Intelligence).  Your inability to control your emotions is not new and one could argue hasn't gotten any better.          So don't underestimate us fans.  I sure hope you learned from the JP incident.  You're a grown man also, so practice what you preach.  Peace
Why r u not in the gym shooting.
Ethered
raising a successful son isnt just about money... really shortsighted take.
I love draymond but he's wrong regarding "common" ppl. Because of the Cancel culture we live in, ppl lose their livelihoods over less. Grace or not, consequences exist for a reason.
Dillon Brooks should just play ball, and focus on helping this good team become a great team.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Memphis puppies have exit the chat.
Drey love you to death but the last game you got 1 rebound and mess my ticket up smh but you had a good game with 11 assists
The funny thing is idk why Brooks even brought up Draymond to begin with lmfao. With all the drama surrounding the Grizzlies was this his way of trying to divert the attention away from Ja???
Why isn't this podcast titled 'Quite Frankly' ?
I love my brother, but he is emotional like a woman on her menstrual cycle.  Stop acting like a itch and man up. I'd say it too his face if he was here
I'm not worried, warriors are fine in the west
Brooks a simp. Unavailable bum.
What team in the league without the warriors spacing could you play for?🤔
I can’t wait till we get rid of ur weird ass. I c y Tristan smacked u😂
Quite frankly
Mr. Draymond Green, what an awesome wisdom session 12:29 through the end. Yes, young Ja Morant, one of my favorite NBA players, is going to come back summer than ever. One of the best things is to be on top and make a poor choice that allows the opportunity to grow in a better direction, early in life at age 23. So much support and words of the wise from the older NBA veterans and those who have traveled this road. Blessings to you and your family, and everyone here 🙏🌎💙🌍💚🙏 @drjeanco
"Brooks is a bum!" - in Klay's voice
damn draymond is so well-spoken he’s damn near a pastor at this point. like there was a moment when he was talking when i felt like i was in church
He be acting like he’s the reason they won chips 😭
People don’t realize ja doesn’t hang around anyone who makes more money than him so nobody can tell him what to do or control his actions. That hood lifestyle addicted he needs to hang around strictly millionaire’s
Jordan Poole just knew they had a better chance scoring if they turned the ball over than if he gave it to Draymond for the shot 😂
You said it exactly right we don’t look at common people that way because they are COMMON people. This fool Ja is an NBA all star. Millions of kids and people look up to this man. 100 something mill in the bank. Powerade and Nike. He wanna be young dolph so bad he gonna end up like him too if he doesn’t knock the bs off and get his mind on his fam and hoops
RIP Brooks
Love, love, love everything you said to D.B. Hilarious!!  DayDay you're an AMAZING person.  You're growing and maturing just like all the rest of us as we get older... learning from your mistakes and understanding regrets to do better is the absolute definition of maturity and intelligence intelligence
How many times u say quite frankly tho
Dillion brooks just needs to stop talking if he’s going to get roasted like this 😂
you tell em dray
"we all make mistakes" we all DONT get paid that kind of money. we all ARENT a celebrity followed by the masses. with that comes responsibility would a common person do the same... we wouldnt even talk about it....causes we would not know and the person would go to jail and now you want us to have understanding? dude you are basketball players not above the rules "he is a grown man" so...^^ and by the way calling taking a gun to the airport the plane the hotel the facility the club a mistake...his decision was made....
Why Draymond didn't talk about how he gave up in the middle of a play?..
Draymond yous a ban
😂😂😂😂😂 love how he called him a 🤡 less go dubs
It time to get our act together! Strength in Numbers! Good habits work at home and on the road! Our defense is not good right now! Our coaches must do a better job of coaching! Our players are taking to many 3 shots attempts. We need to drive to the basket sometimes to draw fouls to put pressure on the opponent. We are not rebounding well. We are just going through the motions! We are not connected on both ends of the court! We have to make the opponents work hard on defense!
WHY! WHY! WHY,WHY,WHY!!!! You'll trippin lol. Love You'll,  but you'll trippin lol!!!🥰😍☺️
I love it 💀😭
put “quite frankly” on a shirt. podcast merch since u say it so much.
why do u say “quite frankly” so much loll
draymond should get “quite frankly” tatted
I get it but there are no African Americans...there are only Americans....we live in the 21st century. I live in a country full of immigrants and i don´t call them Bosnia Austrians, African Austrians or Turkish Austrians. They are just Austrians to me. They live in my country and have our citizenship. That makes them Austrians.I don´t care where you come from. We are all brothers and sisters. Get a fucking grip USA.
Ya the champs , remember people don’t show up to watch the home team . They show up to watch the Champs. That’s why ya suck on the road . The home team wants blood.
Dillion "Dynasty" Brooks!!! LMAO, fuccin' clown.
Quite frankly, I enjoyed this video
Dillon would whoop draymond🤣🤣
Common folk don’t get charges dropped in two days. Common folk simply don’t get the treatment professional athletes get. Common folk would simply get held in jail for six months and then eventually convicted. Come on, Dray.
Well spoken. Once again...
DRAYMOND "QUITE FRANKLY" GREEN. 😆
Where has this show been ??? I’m in love . Gotta say this is some great talk show, from a true champion . Even though I am a lakers fan , I love this show . I just subscribed and been watching all the videos . Memphis brook shut your mouth and bow down to a real champion . His right you’re a clown . Green love you buddy keep up the great work .
Hope you see my comments Draymond I'm glad that you are shooting the ball now because when you scored double-digit you guys win games and you play a lot better it just can't be sc30 everyone else needs to be consistent in their plan and shooting
Great episode! Dray spoke all facts! Ja is one of my favorite young players so I pray he gets it together.
The teams are stacking against y'all this is why no one in the west is really blowing anybody out in the standing because all the teams of stacking against y'all what I would like to see from the teams is a more Collective plan together stop filing stop turning the ball over and everyone on the team don't need to shoot 3 whatever happened to create this shot pulling up making a shot doing something different you guys are the defending champs all teams are coming at y'all you guys have to figure it out and play better as a team
Somebody let Dillon know he trash talking somebody that got more rings then his whole organization. Shit probably more than the whole roster combined too.
Would like to see the look in Brooks' face after getting this.
atleast he finishes the game
On Ja, yeah his parents raised a successful young black man but his mother calling him to the mall to fight her battles and his fathers behavior on the sidelines says a lot. I feel they are enablers of his bad behavior though
Draymond talk like he wasn't on TMZ 🤣🤣 this why yall not winning on the road. You on a podcast. Talking about other players like you ain't a reason KD left. Or like you ain't steal young Poole. Or kick several dudes in the balls. You're a goofball yourself
Quite frankly
16 quite franklys in this episode
This is fire 😂
Why does he sound like he’s gargling his saliva, this man does not have a face for TV and he doesnt have a voice for podcasts either, quite frankly
That Dillion brood segment was a violation 💀
quite frankly
Maybe hes too young for this show but what brooks just did reminds me of "when keeping it real goes wrong"😂😂😂. Now what ja did is the same, except its not nearly as much of a joke.
Damn he flamed Dillion " Dynasty " Brooks 🔥🔥😳
Stop giving up because you don't get passed to
For the people that say Draymond green doesn’t contribute to the warriors 😂😂 I want you to go watch steph curry and klay thompson (their top 2 scorers) and literally 80% of the shots they get are assisted by Draymond green I’m not even a warriors fan but to say a player that gets 32-35 minutes a night doesn’t contribute to a team that has multiple rings and who are defending champions is just Ludacris lol
Draymonds is a sick abusive man that hurts those smaller then him. Who's with me!!!?
We can have grace for people, and still hold them accountable at the same time.
Why people be acting like a gun is the devil what if she showed a knife, pepper spray, or taser I wondered if the situation still would have blown up I understand he represents the nba and have younger supporters but anything literally can be used as a weapon
Stop being a B on defense. Get your camp in order, or shove those 4 rings up your... Well I'm sure you have had things in there already.
10:59 Damn Dray. Absolutely cooked Brooks...
can't wait for tomorrow's matchup 🔥 let's go Warriors!!!
Man I love when Dray talk that 4 time champion talk😂… As a Memphis fan we gotta eat that one. Brooks is on an expiring contact anyways. 🤷🏾
Dray makes a great point. No one should miss the fact that Tee Morant raised a successful young black man in America. But ...is that somehow easier to do in other countries???
Such bs. "Black man" this, "black man"" that. How about human being. You the biggest race baiter on YouTube. Peace Draymond BLACK MAN Green. The millionaire whos the national authority on black oppression. Good at what you do on the court though - no doubt achieved by oppressing white folks out of their role on the team.
Out of all the people this clown is taking about ja morrant? First look at yourself in the mirror you hockey goon. Second you can't answer why you are loosing on the road, "out goes your phoney claim of being the best defender and leader in the game" 😆😅🤣😂
Fam I’m 36 and my pops can and will still whoop my butt.
Go DG solid dubnation
Bro ur ego is the problem u arent as good as u once was /think
Good segment “Slugger” 🤔😅🤣🤷🏾‍♂️👊🏾💪🏾
Brother I love the way you disseminate both sides of issues like a regular well though person. You just got a new subscriber.
Draymond sound kinda crazy if a school teacher goes on live like n a strip club and post a gun they getting fired and they don’t make nearly as much and not just teachers there is more Jobs that will fire you for shit like this
Quite frankly
I can see Green going to the Grizz, Brooks gone, and they getting to the finals 👀
4:45  is when things get interesting
Dray hurt my feelings bruh rotfl
This podcast need chapters.
DG bro thank u for taking time and talking to people it’s really nice ur doing this brother with this u help a lot of people bro we with u 🇦🇲
Idk… The fact that his mom called Ja to the mall because someone was messing with her, and then he showed up 9 deep like a punk, tells me that his parents dint get it and the main reason he’s successful is because he’s an awesome athlete and great baller. Secondly, you’re wrong, that’s not Ja and he’s acting silly 💯😂😂
I'm afraid steph gotta put 70+ pts on the road to win the game, that would be fun to watch
Love what you had to say about Ja.. Idiots on Tv have no clue what they’re talking about. He made a mistake, he’ll bounce back🙏🏽
Warrior die hard but I can't stand drammond he thinks he's worth 30 million a year for single digit everything and he's old his best years are behind him offer 10 million a year and move on
just play hard man, stop talkin!
I’m drunk off my ass bc I took a shot every time Dray said “quite frankly”.
Dre why dont u get a de e t jump shot?
Draymond Grace
Salute Dray,a lot of people act like they never made any dumb decisions in their livelihood as long as you learn from your decisions
JA gotta check his friends, those aren't good friends!!
Sounds Good "Now". But Dramon Dillion Brooks gets his "Bully Bad" from Watching "YOU" for the Last "3" Rings You Got by Snatching Players Jerseys as they go up For The Basket or Rebound, Slapping LeBron in the Jewels, Kicking Adam's in The Jewels ect. So Dillion is a "Mini-You!"
As a Memphis born grizzlies fan since the move. I absolutely face palm when anyone other than coach or Steve adams speaks 🤦
Stop stopping on plays when you please sun
I’m not a warrior fan draymond but man you where right about Dillion brooks, I really don’t see the purpose of him on the court 😂 and he talks a lot for no reason he should just quit and be a teacher like me it’s ok we all can’t be NBA players I accepted that a long time ago 😂
... quite frankly....😐🤣
Powerful message Draymond. You have my respect!
Draymond with the insightful commentary…. especially his take on grace & the dynamics of a son who was raised by his father who becomes successful enough to become the breadwinner….in a BLACK HOUSEHOLD….. Well done king, well done.
Draymond favorite saying is quite frankly
Dam, Draymond. I am proud to know that there are young men that still carry wisdom, and that know how to give advice, and share knowledge, without being judgemental, hateful, and harmful! To another human being, but also understanding, to the fact that mistakes, and bad decisions are part of growth, and does not mean. Take away their happiness, and ability to provide, a way to live, which is completely based on $$$$. I now know why my team I have loved from childhood, winning, and losing. [ From Zeros, to Heros ], is because Men like You, Steph, Clay, Iggy, Mark, Steve, and too many others to type. Warriors are a Team that has a blessing of Greatness placed above, and around it. It started with 4 men being brought in. Mark, Steph, Clay, and Draymond. Steve just added a little Icing. P S Bob M, solid Dude! Stay up (Golden State Is Great).
Draymond. Just take responsibility.  Time to move on
It’s not like Ja can’t provide for his family if he were to get kicked out the NBA. Dude is a 🤡
Draymond Green don’t ever speak about politics talking about gun control is an issue. No it’s not unless you’re a woke Democrat that wants to take Americans rights away. Plenty of people have guns that don’t kill people what about knives so the next time somebody gets stabbed to death should we ban all knives too. It’s very annoying when professional athletes try to get involved with politics something they know nothing about Steph Curry went to the White House OK to see Joe Biden seriously that should tell you everything you need to know they are clueless
checkmate ... dumbass Dillon
“I have 15 techs, one less than yo dumbass” 😂😂😂😂 comedy
w sgiw
Hey Draymond Green, you would have none of those championships without Steph Curry facts. You’re a role player facts. You guys just got beat by the thunder bro how are you going to win a playoff game on the road? Championship hangover it’s over goodbye, unless you guys can flip on the switch and turn up the heat and lock in it’s over not the same team either from last season
🤣🤣🤣 Dillon was asking for this
TALK UR ISH DRAYMOND, HUMBLE THIS BUM
What is on his forhead?
Dray focus on your game and leadership away from home.  Love you, but you are the leader in Defence, you say it all the time, but now we getting to the must win time of the season and need you to just set the positive energetic tone moving forward. Collective mental strength is fostered from the leaders.
Emotional damage 😂.. there's a parade in this podcast yeah!!!!
So this man didn’t address the tamper tantrum her through in the mind of the game!? This man talks a lot.
Draymond said people don’t go after regular people’s job or lives. He forgets we living in “cancel culture” 🤦‍♂️ open your eyes
You guys literally make millions of dollars each year. Your little injury will be fine. Meanwhile I’m out here with real life problems.
Draymond saying hes not sure if Brooks’ team likes him…but we’ve heard Kerr say how annoying Draymond is, Durant left the team in part due to him, and he punched a dude he was supposed to be mentoring. Seems like he maybe lacks self awareness
Champ SIKE😂😂
Quiet Frankly saying that a million times doesn't make you sound smart.
Dillon Dynasty Brooks😂💀🤣
Draymomd, what’s it like to carry on like a little girl cause your daddy didn’t throw you the ball😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“I’m not even sure your teammates like you” is gonna hit him hard with the Dray and JJJ connect  🤣
Draymond “Quite Frankly” Green
The run is over Draymond. Like a that we've seen many times before keep reaching.
12:10 Cause it ain’t happening right now champ. UHHHH. U NOT A CHAMP. U A CLOWN💀💀💀💀💀😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂🤣🤣
For a multimillionaire, Draymond could get some higher quality camera equipment. Great podcast but the camera quality is sub par. It feels like early 2010s
Where does knock the hell out of Poole rank on your list ?
After hearing this I’m realizing what a beautiful career Draymond has had. I wonder where he ranks all time fr.
But your pussy ah was crying because a better offensive player than u didn't pass you the ball. You a joke bruh.
Quite frankly, quite frankly and quite frankly
Let’s ask why our defense is fuckin trash!!!  Like cmon man we gotta pick it up so we can win a chip. KD back in the west. Shit bout to get tough.
Draymond is well spoken when he’s calm.    No one likes Dillion Brooks outside of Memphis even his home town Toronto we don’t like him either.
1) Your Dillon Brooks roasting was 🤌🏾💋👌🏾  2) Your commentary about the worlds hate lust is dead on accurate and hearing you speak about grace with such feeling was beautiful.   3) Please put your foot in your defenses’ ass man. I know you fucked up smacking Jp but now it’s time to line them all up and picket fence them with a fucking stick.   4) Unless somebody got cancer, drag that Canadian back to the gym by his hair.   5) Tell GP 2 he’s one of my imaginary baby daddies and I leave a warm plate for him every night.   6) The Volume is the shit. Between this and Jason Tempf…..magnificent hoop shit.   Ciao
Bro imma fan but i think this show should  be put on hold until the team can find way to win on the road ..no disrespect but we need what u speaking on here with that same energy in the locker room , we all are rooting for you . Salute
Yeah Dray I hope people stop condemning and pray for the young man's future with Ja Morant.🙏🙏
Preach. I’m so over this Grizzlies team, think they’re bad boy pistons or some thugs, just a bunch of clowns. If brooks injures one more player someone needs to take his ass out go play for the titans and get CTE punk ass
He’s gotta pop that thing in his forehead. I can’t focus
It was such a good episode a total different insight. Everyone else was just echoing the same stuff. You hit the nail with your perspective.
Truth be told, Dillon is out of line with the way he treats Draymond!  And as I've said before and will repeat again: I really hope Ja will be able to beat his battles. Hopefully this will be his last and only hiccup in his career. I want to see him play for a long time😫😓 He's the reason I started watching the NBA, now I'm too big of a fan . One of my favorite players, hope things will improve from here on out! Love Ja❤❤❤❤❤ I really don't want to see anything bad happen to him!!!
White America.....stop watching any ESPN sponsored programming. They are endorsing anti-white values. See Kendrick Perkiins and Stephen A.
Is this the same person that try to hurt a teammate
Real grizzly fans don’t like him I’m a diehard grizzly
man said quite frankly about 1000 times
I hate Draymond Green! Not as a person, as I don't have the right and don't know the man. As a player, however, he's become everything I find distusging and ridiculous: his unncecessary aggression leading to  desperate fouls and much more, his inability to shoot, lead or get results especially in crunch time, and his pathetic pride on past glory of the Warriors, who anyone in their right mind can see are not championship material any longer -- that ship has sailed. However, his comments on and advice for Ja Morant are insightful and right on the money. He is one of the few in the media and the franchise not judging something they don't fully understand. In this video, he's showing great maturity in breaking things down as objectively as possible based on his worldview and leaving it to Ja to decide who he wants to be. This level of maturity can only come from truly learning from past life lessons, offered in total sincerity. To me, this accepting attitude is the very definition of love. I now have great respect for the man -- never for the player though.
He's successful because of his skills not his brain
Damn you didn't mention punching your teammate in the face in the front of the whole team and having the video leak which probably caused that man shame and embarrassment as one of your worst NBA moments smh very telling
Feeling like the nobody seems to recognize how different the team energy is with Steph on court. Over the last half dozen games prior to SC's return JP made  a huge evolution in running the offense. He was really starting to control and distribute and slowed way down on the 3ball and instead hunted the open player or a better read on the defense. It was fantastic to watch because Klay and bench were engaged and empowered. This ended up giving them that last 4 game run where everyone was getting touches with lots of double digit scores across the roster. This also kept everyone engaged in the transitions feeding tons of energy on the defensive end. With Steph there is too much emphasis on him being the dominant scorer which for me, as much as I love seeing him do his thing it is not nearly as exciting as seeing the whole team sharing the ball. This is a better team than last year with great depth and shooters galore. Steph does not need to carry anyone now. He needs to let go of that role and get back to warriors ball. Btw, really really missing Belli. That man was soooooo underated in soooo many ways on what he did for the team. He and Kevon were the silent difference makers to taking the whole enchilada!
If he did a great job on his son Ja wouldn't be acting like a wannabe thug.
I really appreciate the conversation on grace. The whole world could truly benefit by giving more grace to each other.  The response to Dillion Brooks was fantastic.
Its gonna be a W for us tomorrow fosho
Grace for a fool who has multiple incidents. Regular people don’t make 200 million and have a big platform… no time for a pity party. Can we give him another chance? Hell yes! But don’t compare that to regular people famo
I think draymond green should be the last person to speak
Bro you got to do better
Dillon brooks is what this guy used to be.
love you Dre!
why you give on play when pool did not pass you the ball again the thunder
GSW should have signed Kevin Love.  😑 what do you think 🤔??
I want to say that I have unsubscribe this channel . I used to be a fan but with draymond as one of the host I can say I’m losing interest because this guy .
Dray really said "commonfolk" 😂
It was like eminem dissing machine gun Kelly.
Believe y'all definitely need a rim protector that may solve the problem
i love the show but how many times are you gonna say “quite frankly”
Great show & points Draymond 👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏
Ja should be banned for rest of year. Period. He needs to learn a serious lesson on life. Play the game and shut your mouth Ja.
Motel 6 until you put together a streak of wins on the road
Bruh gone get having your own podcast banned for NBA players
Best one yet...didn't talk around it, talked right to it. Hats off sir!
Well said
Don't Golden State play Memphis tomorrow night on National TV let your play do the talking DB. DG has 4 chips
Indonesia loves  Draymond Green  . .. ofcorse also Ja 🤩😄
Brooks is a loser. A larger Chris Paul
Draymond U K.O.d your teammate, mr dont wish injury on no one lol
Seem like erbody else a juror to get bro thrown and dray the 1 that get the whole trial threw out
Good input on this and i hope that he will change Ja has a kid to think about.
The "common folk" have a chance at getting arrested if they wave a gun around a strip club while intoxicated. Or beating up a 17 year old and flashing a gun at him... or potentially pointing guns at Pacers staff... Forget going after your money or job... Stupid comment from Draymond.
Quite frankly!! Draymond Green is the worst possible person to talk about any other man acting a fool, you knocked out your young teammate you fool..!!! instead of showing your class and experience. Tired of anybody and everybody buying a mic and talking nonsense to then say this is a podcast/show. 🤡🤡🤡
What an episode! Draymond one day should replace Skip and debate Shannon 😂
Grace and mercy all day look at how some people are going against Wiggins and Ja that's sad Ja just needs to humble himself but not lose his job great job Draymond I love this podcast now Brooks was served lol
What’s good with you and Jordan Poole??
Boooo🤮🍅🍅🍅 crying donkey
Yo yo! You my boy and all that, but are you going to address that fit you through last night and not getting back on defense ?
How many times did Draymond say "Quite Frankly" IJFS
Sure Tee Morant brought that part of him out that raised a successful young man.   _Haha salutes on roasting tf out of Brooks respectfully_ 🤣🤣 _And let's get some fkn road wins_ 💯💯
Anyone think Draymond would even be in the league by now if he wasn’t drafted to the Warriors?  Why do we give so much credence to a glorified Mark Madsen hahaha
Dray talking about grace but showed Dillon none.  Just sayin....
the dynasty starts AFTER you....oof. dillon brooks RIP
Draymond's wrong again. There's outcry for "regular" people to lose their job all the time. Teachers lose their jobs a lot for things they do on the internet.
Draymond "quite frankly" Green
I can see warriors beating teams in playoffs
when the other one nothing to boast about and the other have the right to talk and trash talk because draymond has 4 rings and brooks has nothing as in 0🤣🤣🤣
Your comments shows compassion, accountability, and wisdom. Respect.
lol I actually just saw 2videos before this about how the Grizzlies were a young team that everyone liked 2 years ago and became the most hated team currently. Poor Steven Adams needs to get out of there.
Dra, as #1 fun of GSW and a mom of you’ll, my advice to you all is to put your differences aside and unite as one family and help each other to succeed and excel. It’s beautiful to watch you guys winning and being on top of the league as the best team. We need you veterans to help the young ones excel too, no matter how they behave sometimes. They are your younger brothers and therefore, immature so please exercise patience with them and focus on the business. Thanks and love you all. God bless you all and good luck. Praying for you all always. Never despair, keep up the good work!
As a Father I can say yes its not Tee's responsibility to control Ja. He did his Job by raising him to be a successful young black man in America. But it is Tee's responsibility to not encourage Ja's Behavior
Not sure if I have heard from the NRA trying to defend the second amendment of Ja Morant
Did draymond really just say "it's giving" byeeeeeeee 😂
This is the second time this season has had a GREAT home stand while steph was injured. All of a sudden he comes back while they’re one the road yet again to ruin the depth of the team with his extreme talent & need to take shots 😢 sad reality
can u use a headset so ur hands can b free ur body more comfortable/relaxed & we can see ur drip better thnx! ‘Straight Otta Frisco’ BALLIN!
Why did you give up on that play vs OKC? Or am I not aloud to ask that because I haven't won a championship in the NBA? Hahahaha
Excellent stuff,  oh yeah!!!
I like Draymond and his game but quite frankly I don't know how many times he said quite frankly!!
dillon brooks all talk no show
His take on T Morant is excellent
I respect you and have been a loyal fan for years. Like you said about most people not understanding basketball.  I feel the same way about guns with you.  People in this country mostly on the left don't understand guns and our desire to process them. I live in Michigan where the majority of us carry and process many different guns for many different reasons.  Law abiding citizens who own guns of all make aren't committing crimes.  Should everyone in the NBA be punished because Morant did wrong? Should everyone be punished and not be able to carry cell phones in their cars because a bunch of people texted and drove and caused an accident? The gun issue is politically motivated. You can take and ban all the guns you want but the criminals will still have them.I wish you would have a conversation with gun owners that you normally wouldn't talk to and hear our side and try to hear how we feel. I love you guys and really wish you would get out of your bubble and get out and meet people who don't fit in with you but respect you for who you are. I live in an area that is majority white. We stand tall with you and the black community when it comes to racial profiling and all. I know mainly conservatives and all of us that I know were disgusted with the police brutality going on.  We don't want that shit happening. Every time there's an election these asshole politicians use division to get elected, and it works.  Those MFERS don't speak for me.  We're not the boogie man they make us out to be.  We need loud voices like yours to bring people from both sides together to have conversations.  We can't keep going on like this and believe our country will just fix itself.  If we keep talking through our political mouth pieces we'll never come together and have piece in this country.  They're going to drive us all off a cliff for their own gain. Anyway.  I just wanted to say what I feel even if it makes no sense to anyone else.  People will listen if someone is willing to provide a table to have a conversation weather we agree or not.
I love your approach to this situation, clearly some of these guys won’t play for Memphis next season when you have distractions like they have and you’re trying to make a name in this league you just have to give yourself a new Avenue to perform, in order to make your career work. Dray you have had your days in the light and you have grown from it. Hopefully these guys look at the Draymond’s, Steph’s, Bron’s and others and take a page out you’ll book and read ALL lines. Love my men but we have to set examples for our kids as well.
We love u draymond give it to em straight No chaser 😊 LETS GO WARRIORS 👏
I can name lesser well known players on every roster from every team and they have haven’t soiled the NBA’s rep like Ja is doing. I hope Ja learns from this. That is all.
Brooks would cook draymond in a 1v1 tho
Think is time to give it a pause during the season. Trust this will cost money on his new contract
Can’t these ballkickers just get along
NBA is rigged against GSW that’s what’s happening.
Idiot is the best word to describe Dillon Brooks. He’s been out of control for quite some time. What is it going to take for the NBA to check this simpleton?
Quite frankly counter please?
Green Will be a Laker next season lol
Love the show, but quite frankly you gotta work on using filler words less. I think you said "quite frankly" like 20 times lol
Didn't hold back on Brooks did he...Brooks better be playing tomorrow night. Gonna be a wild game 😅
Tee Morant is not getting "all slander". Many are pointing out that he has been out glad handing from day one with the star players and celebs instead of setting a diff example for his son. That is not slander.
fy for bringing race into everything, scum
If you saying you can control your temper. Then what happened to you controlling your emotions with your own teammate?
I’m not worried about gsw. Y’all always find a way to bounce back.  Hope owners find a way to pay you
You guys messing with my mental health
draymond green a legend 💪🏽 but i feel he should ask nardwaur how to use a classic microphone 🎤 😂 salute champ
Why does every Draymond podcast look like it's recorded from a Zoom call
He didnt mention anything about Perk
Ohhh am i Lookin forward to 2morrow's game
Dray look like he could eat a whopper in one bite.
DG was Spittin......
Draymond Green and Kyrie Irving will be Lakers next year.
dude the only person I listened to bout ja.. him & pat. Ja is young and made mistakes that a young millionaire with a lot going on around him, hopefully as a young dude he learns from this situation because if could’ve been worse but the fact people judging dude as if WE ALL don’t make mistakes is wild. hopefully this is something that he can learn and grow as a man and leader from for his daughter and his team that’s all bro.
Why play these reindeer games with them ?  It's clear no one takes them seriously,  they are trying so hard to stir up some media and they have many, "the hype-man".  I am loving the odds on you all making it two the finals and odds to win it all,  so yeah, I am taking a large position on you coming out of the west, if fact in my mind who ever comes out of the west wins it all.
FYI, BLACK (a legal designation for the ALL CAPS slave name, which we ALL race wise (house vs field) are a surety as debt slaves) means dead in the the commercial matrix most have no clue that covertly enslaves us by.
4 rings or not, the next time you throw a temper tantrum in the middle of a high stakes play and game, gsw fans will drop your azz so fast.
When Jordan Poole will sucker punch you like you did him…
Draymond stop saying quite frankly before every so called important thing you want to say. It doesn't make you sound more intelligent. It comes across to me as if you think it makes you sound more knowledgeable. Use your words Draymond. There are many besides quite frankly.
Great show Dray 🔥🔥
I saw it draymond okc got 15 free throws in the 3rd quarter that killed yall momentum ref’s have been against y’all all year😡
"You are not a champion, you are a clown"
I like how Draymond has all this advice about clowns but just punched his teammate in the face a few months ago and some would say he cost the “Dubs” a chip on a 73-9 season, being what some would call a “clown”
JA so immature 🙄 I understood its a lack of maturity.  Nobody wants to be a quite good dude our culture wants as to be a bad ass so guns are the answer to be a bad ass.  That's a immature way of thinking how the world works which is totally wrong.  JA it's simple your an NBA player stick to basketball 🏀  JA show me your friends and I can tell you who you are
It’s always the bus riders that talk the most.
Quite frankly…. I like this podcast, quite frankly
dillon brooks is beloved by his teammates and grizzlies fans…the fact the dillon is hated makes grizz fans love him more 💯 and i don’t like the warriors either so he’s speaking for grizz fans when he says that 💯
I get enough of u embarrassing my team! Still haven’t forgot u said we wouldn’t beat the cavs without KD
Draymond, you obviously like to hear yourself speak and to you, your comments are banal. You hold yourself in such high regards and one should do for themselves. But you are the Luke Longley of the Warriors. I hope you thank Steph and Clay and KD each time you look at those rings. I don't think you should be speaking on Ja's situation, good or bad.
This dude full of shyt smh ....
Did Dillon called you a pedestrian?
The Grizzlies would have a Dynasty too if they beat a depleted finals team one year, and begged KD to play with them.
Well said Draymond, well said!
We’re waiting for you in the playoffs @Dillon Brooks! It’s going to be a pleasure to woop your ass on more time
Yes, we all make mistakes.  But, in my career some mistakes had consequences that made clear to me and others that we would never make that particular mistake.  We had no tolerance policies in many organizations that I've interacted with.  No tolerance for violence against workmates.  No tolerance for racial slurs in the workplace.  No tolerance for sexual harassment.  No tolerance for guns in classrooms!    I actually liked these policies and wanted to see them enforced.  That's the world that I worked in.
Just passing Thur  great information and great advice
Draymond what is your GSW contract? I can't wait when you leave 😌 GSW I believe it's time to move fwd.  You had a great run with GSW and nobody can take that away from you.  Clippers needs your expertise you would be a good fit for them.  What do you think?
Poole hater
The crazy thing is , as soon as Dillion brooks finds out what draymond does is when the grizzlies will have everything they need to win a championship
Dudes gonna be real Salty when warriors don't offer him another contract lmao time for veteran warming up the bench 😂
Basketball players are not like your average Joe. In the public eye. Role models. Your responsibility is more than the random guy working on the job site. Stupid argument.
😬🫣🤭🫡
"stand on it!" - Draymond Green
Great show, great advice spoken from the ❤!!!
AMEN
Some good points but absolutely NOT the podcast I was looking for. Smh
Brilliant response on Ja's situation.
I like how he came to the defense of Tee. Seems like everyone is going at him even though his son is an adult. He did his job. All he can do is talk to Ja as a grown man.
Props to Draymond for his take, but man, you gotta have a better camera now with all of that millions you earn.
eh, i wouldnt agree with your take on ordinary ppl not paying for there mistakes in similar ways. i would argue nba players status and money buys them a lot of cover for there fuckups that ordinary ppl do not have. kinda  a clown take tbh. i agree with giving ppl grace but to play the victim in this way is kinda sad.
This is the first time listening to your show Draymond. Damn, I didn't know it was a fact-spittin show! You didn't have to go hard on Brooks like that! XD
Blessings 🙏🏾❤️🙏🏾 I like Draymond take on Ja, mainly on Grace. I believe everyone can change and given the opportunity too. Some change from Good to bad and bad to good. Not that they bad etc. But doing bad/good. We do pay attention to people saying take this or that away. Pay attention to who are saying this is the blue print to change. Yeah! I didn't like hits on his dad. However, I believe if Ja do not change for better we could see a tragic situation and WE are trying to open his eyes to that.   Bless 🙏🏾
Putting down fans same time.. shows his vibes.. I don't think Draymond is as good as he thinks..
Mad respect for your take on Ja. That's our guy and we pray he'll be fine. Mad respect for you Dre. But I still don't like yol GSW winning asses lol.
DAMN Draymond just destroyed Dillon like how a wrestler not only owned him in a promo segment but also buried him too 💀
We use to like you not no more..
"Quite frankly" -Draymond Green
Would you have punched Poole in the head last night if nobody was watching/filming?
When you take a look and hear what draymond green just said make me look at things totally different now all of us need is grace . None of us is perfect.
Number 1 you should off kicked Pooles ass, talking sht about money to you after, im sure you have taught him right. And 2016 let me see, Steph choked.???? Dramond blew up.Yea thats what happen. Or Maybee ( I know Bron is your friend) Bron gave up, threw Dramond to the ground and then Walked over Dramond, and Dramond lost his mind and blew up. And got up threw a backhand and pulled the punch. This is the truth, Dramond and Steph has 5 NBA championship and Bron 3 Titles. How can a guy Throw someone to the ground walk over him, so Dramond get up pissed and then throws a backhand and pulls the punch. The ref review it and the NBA front office review it, And suspended  Dramond.  Anyone who watched the play or replay, knows Bron knew he was dead so he wanted out so he attacked Dramond. And Dramond showing restraint gets suspended. I may not Know BB the way you all do but I know fighting and Bron not only started the whole and attacked Dramond, and Dramond got up pissed like anyone would after getting attacked that is a man would throw a punch. But for all you retards out there that say Dra hit bron. Take a close look Dramond was going hit Bron and threw what is called a back hand, but look close. Dramond did not hit Bron, he threw the punch and then he pulled the punch showing great restraint. This is Dramond we are talking about, a fighter, And gets pissed for good reason throws a punch and then pulls it. Bron Should off been suspended Dramond should off been praised for pulling a punch he wanted to let go.  That is why to me is Splash bro's and Dra 5 NBA titles and Bron 3. I know you all love Kerr but what he has done this season borderlines a Insane madman. I think no team could win with TY, Lamb and Poole taking as many mins as they do. Kerr should off stopped the 2 way experiment because it was and is a failure, and let wiseman play. I Know Lacobe and Mayer is pissed about the way Wiseman was railroaded off the team. Wiseman has no confidence, he cant even catch the ball and he is always injured. People saying that crap never competed in anything. Kerr put so much pressure on Wiseman, who already has a super lots to deal with already just being a rook and a 2nd overall pick is enough pressure. Then you throw a coach who is playing guys that no team wanted, and giving them way more mins and letting them play thru mistakes. But the youngs make a mistake  they get Yanked put on the bench for the rest of the game and maybe more. sent to the "D" league to develope. Then they start to acually play ball and and stat there development. But 3 games later Kerr calls them back, and then sits them and lets them rot on the bench. Only playing time they get is garbage time. So if you stupid ass bandwagons who never competed in anything saying Wiseman is a bust, he cant catch the ball and he is always injured. This is called pressure from a mad man. Tell me this why is Wiseman playing ball,  this soon with a team he never played with. He has not been injured, he is catching the ball, and he is getting confident. And nobody is calling Wiseman a bust no more. Kerr is doing the same to Kuminga Moody and PBJ. Notice a trend. Moody and PBJ have been injured, Moody who plays well anyime Kerr is not the coach. PBJ who also battling injurys. For all you know it alls out there who dont think pressure will not make people move and react in a way that is not normal  and with the compitition level what it is, people will get injured more,  make more mistakes, and will generally suck. Im sorry but to me Kerr is an overrated maniac and it was Mike Brown who was the brains off this outfit. Kerr has been exposed He is not only losing with the NBA champs but is distroying the Players and the team. Kerr is not a stable human.
Please come to my bucks Draymond
I am here NOT to listen to you but want to let you know that you were unprofessional last night. You embarrassed us the Warriors!!!  I am very disappointed in you.   Get your act together and get back to be you the Warriors I knew for 10 years.  You guys didn't play with joy anymore.  Now everyone know you guys are suck, so they all going to run on you so they all did & that's why you guys kept losing on the road.  Come on Dray. Let's go Warriors.
Dillion Brooks corny & he need to play better before he start running at the mouth like he a good player !
All FACTS.
Dray is one of the biggest trash talkers besides Patrick Beverly of today’s era and I really wish I could see him play against Rodman or Barkley. I know he has 4 rings to back it up though 😂
Disappointed the way Draymond played yesterday
this is like watching a caveman give advice to a troglodyte
Dillon Brooks from Canada 😂😂😂😂😂
Quite frankly
Thanks for giving it straight up.  No bull.
Draymond stop acting like u cold bruh u played yo part but u not him....u benefited from the best system to exploit what u could give 2 the game....
You a good brother COME PLAY WITH LBJ LA BABY!!!!!! I CAN SEE IT COMING!!!!!!
I appreciate you Draymond 💪🏾⭐️
Good  job!!!!
Ur a diva u clown ass bum
You cant give up plays DG you’re the anchor of your team..
FUNNY HOW TORONTO FANS CHEERED WHEN KD WENT DOWN AND NOW NO ONE WANT TO PLAY FOR THEM AND KWAI LEFT. PEOPLE DONT FORGET AYYYYYYYYYYY
Love Draymond but 1 rebound last night .Looney 5 rebounds  need to be better and stay healthy 😀😀
Draymond. How can you hear Dillon Who with all the ringing from the 4 blings blings?
Dray day is elite, Dylan  Crooks is not in his class, should be grateful he's in the league
Hit like if you heard his "quite frankly "
Brooks is a bum
actually when common people do what ja did, they do lose their jobs too sooo.. eh
He might swing on draymond next game
Not a Warriors fan but Memphis cannot beat GState.
Love the dubs. Love this pod. Great analysis as always. Grace, an interesting concept. Not something the media is interested in giving.
They both got valid points tho , nobody would know DRAYMOND if he was on another team . And Dillion holding Memphis back because his dumb shot selection and turnovers and costly fouls
I RESPECT DRAY'S COMMENTS TO JA.💯
Man , draymond it's really wise
I love dray but if I hear “quite frankly” one more time ima kill somethin
The Draymond "quite frankly" Green show
i dont care about Dillion Brooks or Memphis.. but real question, would Golden State win any of those rings without Draymond? I would say the KD one for sure still could happen but what about the other rings? Could they be won without Draymond? The answer to the question for ME is a indicator of how important he was to the GS run.
Grace is an underrated attribute right now all round. Agree and thank you for pointing it out 🙌
In my humble opinion the overall morale of Dub culture is extremely low at the moment. The team's issues are not external they are internal and intrinsic. There seems to be a multiplicity of personality differences and generational challenges interfering with the team's lack of chemistry and ability 2 gel. Now for the million $ ? of WHY Dubs can slay at home but crumble on the road??? Even though the team is fractured and out of synch in their core, such issues can be easily ignored and offset by the intoxicating support from their fans. The cheers from the adoring crowd supersede the internal problems that they are currently having. The comfort and security of being supported by house fans is a temporary bandaid that masks and distracts from the real issues with the players not being on the same page and failing to click on all 4 cylinders. It is easy to ignore problems at home if your fans can carry you through to victory. Instead of the superior mental synergy of Dubs driving themselves to win at home, it is in fact fan support in the stands that is the main motivating force. Remarkably it is Dubnation that is keeping this team alive and preventing them from completely flatlining. In stark contrast, however, when they are on the road, that fan energy that upheld and sustained them at home is silent, thus creating a LOUD, unnerving void screaming for them to face those same internal issues that are plaguing them.  Such glaring, albeit perpetually ignored core problems create an intensely mental and emotional  strain on the players resulting in an incredibly unrecognizable team uncharacteristic of the elite dynasty that they truly are.  Having no fanfare to carry the Warriors on the road creates unsurmountable pressure,  messes with their psyche and compromises their ability to have laser sharp focus that would result in more wins away from home. Sadly, there seems to be no team cohesiveness, no real brotherhood and no strength in numbers at this time
Dre I'm not your greatest fan but I have mad respect for you. Obviously watching this after the incident with Poole. Nah fam you the leader there and that's not on. As I said I'm a GSW hater for real because yol are that great. Had the same feeling against the Lakers with Kobe and Shaq, yol are great but always against my team the Clippers. Having said that come on B....
say quite frankly one...more...time..😄😆
Play this video and shotgun a beer every time Draymond says "quite frankly".
This guy don’t know other big words besides quite frankly
Golden State Warriors: 👀
This guy likes hearing himself talk to much
I think it’s time to do something different. Let steph play with the bench unit like he did during the playoff
Draymond Quite Frankly Green
"The dynasty starts after you, not with you." DAMN
Grizz haven’t won 4 play off series yet.
Crying for the ball and you only get 2pts you only facilitate the offense don’t really do nothing else
Did you give JP , grace 🤷🏽‍♀️ get out of here with that s$$%.  Gilbert Arenas got cut  out of the league .Plaxico Burress NFL ousted him .
BE SO GLAD WHEN THEY TRADE YOUR SORRY ASS
Good take Dray in both the topics.
Draymond really thinks he’s a great player. He’d be in the European league if he hadn’t landed with the warriors.  He’s a good defender who just does hand offs while klay and Steph run around him shooting 3s.
Draymond Green is ours dubs 💎
Draymond love you bro I don't know you but I've watched you play for years and I feel like you're a great guy but all I'm here right now is a millionaire whining about stuff there's people here in these comment sections just going to watch this that never going to earn a million dollars in a life because they haven't been as blessed as you are chill out
Not trying to be funny but was Dillion playing in the game when they had warriors down by 70?
Draymond, please stop with the name-calling. The Kendrick Perkins incident should teach all of us to not call anybody out of their name.    Dillon Brooks he’s good at what he does and you know more than anybody anybody that has made it to the NBA can play basketball. And I would add they have to have some sort of basketball IQ to get to that level.   In this episode I saw you dish out a lot of critique but let’s talk about the pterodactyl in the room.   I am a huge fan of your podcast but man this came across is like arrogant to me. The whole Dillon Brooks section was so unnecessary. You’re attacking Dillion brooks like you say the old Media attacks players. And you did not even address the huge blunder that you made last night in the second quarter. Come on if we’re going to give it out we got to be able to to take it we’re gonna dish it, we better be able to eat it on a platter when it comes back to our face
Dray SMOKED tf outta that poor Beooks lmao
This dude thinks he’s a god!
I hope you learned to keep your hands to yourself dude
Media is a double edged sword buddy. You can’t just take the good (fame, fortune, unimaginable wealth) without also accepting the bad parts of it (public and fans reacting to off the court nonsense that’s provided to them).
Dillon Brooks, you can't fix his kind of stupid!!!
I’m tired of people who don’t know what it takes to win a championship talk and run they mouth
Grace? This is his 3rd time getting in trouble with a gun.
Good stuff man!
Draymond is a great character. And i am a h8ter generally... and a Grizz fan...can't front
♥
Didn't that one dude give Satan a lap dance in his Nike commercial? Ja will Alright!
This was solid. But Dray, called KP a coon and fake apologized, then knocked out a teammate and made a mini doc about it- you may be a bad person.
The NBA should suspend him for the rest of the 2022-23 season!!! This is very serious!!! The message that Ja Morant is sending to all the youth across America, shows how much you can disrespect a firearm. We don’t need any more firearm problems and fatalities. His endorsements should walk away from him and the NBA should ban him for the rest of the season! That would give him an opportunity to go live that thug life until mid summer.   I already hate him from day 1. So I am getting a lot of joy with this and will milk it. Yes it is a big deal! He is causing more black violence and he disrespected the 2nd Amendment!! He’s a loser until he proves me wrong!
Dray with the REAL talk.
We don't need you pouting we need you to do what you do defend and set up players
Draymond be talking his shxttt😂😂😂
5:42 : Im happy he secured his bag  Same cant be said for you
Dray didn't wanna address the Pool situation coz he knows he was foul for that!!
You played old shit with Igoudala. They need a scorer . You need to shoot the ball
Well said about that clown brooks.. even better of you not to bring up his abusive nature towards woman..
Nah Dray I got a regular job and I’ve seen so-called coworkers call to have someone fired just because their lunch smelled funny lmao
this guy doing advertisements when he's making millions in the nba lmao, mans a real hustler
Draymond went "No Vaseline" on Dillon Brooks.
You dont see yourself Draymond you is the problems of the Dubs. Dont do podcast anymore, You need to practice how to shoot into the paint. They need a scorer not only passing and Defense. You play same old shitt.. they need a second chance shot you need to rebound and shoot into the paint not only staying in three point line 😀you need to wake Up
Dray, guns are not an issue in this country. The issue(s) is how easy you can purchase one & the larger issue being the pills&drugs people take to get them to a point of wanting to do a mass shooting. Its not the guns fault Ja is in trouble, its Ja’s fault. Its not the guns fault mass shootings happen, its the people. Government will continue feeding them pills to mask their real issues, but pointing the finger at the gun is also a lazy mans way of looking at it
Clown 🤡
“Gets away with a lot”-Dillon Brooks 🙄 *laughs in 2016 NBA championship game suspension* 😂
As good as Poole is going to the basket and making plays its really frustrating to watch him hoist up 8 3's a game when he just can't make them consistently at all. I know the Dubs wouldn't have won the title last year without him so I will always have love, but it can be hard to watch him struggle to make shots for this long into the season but still keep firing away.
Quite frankly quite frankly quite frankly quite frankly
This guys killed Mexican miley cyrus
The Grizzlies being the 3rd youngest team in the NBA and 2nd in the west is pretty impressive.
Dude really dissed fans than told yall to forgive the thug activities ja has done. Grace? Anyone who punched a minor, flashed a gun in a club on IG live, would get fired. 🤦 Shows how disconnected millionaires are.
Draymond owned that lightskin shot chucker dillion bricks 😭😭😭😭😭😭
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!!! As soon as a “common” person says something they go viral and lose their job.
I enjoyed this episode quite frankly
You seem like a good person just don’t let the media turn you negative because people watch wen you talk on the negative
6:24 Bruh proceeds to tear down Dillon Brooks for 6 minutes straight 🤣🤣🤣☠️☠️☠️☠️ On His A** ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️
You can't be fine in the west while you out suspended Ja
I agree. The crowd at home gives energy that is transferred into your play. On the road, players have to create their own energy and it much harder. But you guys CAN do it. It’s ALL mental. Maybe you need a Tony Robbins type to talk to the team?
Victor's on deck. For Ja, the chance of being the face of the NBA is NOW, and not a given.  He has this year and next year tops to embrace that opportunity. Anything past that is up for grabs.
Good buddy said “you were a little kid in high school when we were winning championships your a fan” lmao
For the win. Hahaha.
Excellent episode. Someone get a bodybag/fire extinguisher for Mr Brooks RIP 🔥 🫳🏾🎤⬇️
You shouldn’t have pumped ur self up to tear Dillon brooks down there is no grace there I hope u see that your a great player. To call someone a clown he is a champ to even make it to the league I love ur pod I wish great things for everyone god bless
“You not a champ you a clown”😂😂
I don't know you from a can of paint everybody going to start saying that now
Dray, what would happen to any restaurant worker that rolls up in their workplace parking lot with red lasers and doing this crazy shit?  They get fired and they in jail. No body can afford bodies. And to not do this is 1000% NEGLIGENCE on the NBA owners.  Miles L said a terrible word. Got fired basically. This guy pointing guns at kids. You think its the first time?
Ill be Frank...quite Frankly.....This guys named Frank was pretty Frank about how he was quite Frankly being Frank bout suckin Franks ol' quite Franlky......🍻🖕
Let em know every time Dray 👏🏽
I'm far from even liking GSW but dillon brooks needs to stfu
Well said
Famous people do dumb stuff they just use the money to get if normal ppl do it n jail
Imo sleeping ya teammate in practice is worse that what Ja did in the club. Ja didn’t hurt anyone. And there been several stories about Ja that came out that aren’t true. But we all know the masses of sheep will believe anything the media says about a Black Man.  ‘They only disrespect Black Men. They only (try to) cancel Black Men.’ 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
Dray you messed up. you are a locker CEO in the NBA, you should have told us what you would have said when Ja Morant was pointing guns at other players from his vehicle, then pointed it at a visitor at his house, then proudly presents it to the world?  What would you say? you are saying he aint guilty yet?? weak sauce comments.
Perfect. Well said. One of your dopest shows.
Hey dray I'm a huge warrois fan so much that I sneak at night just to watch the games because u guys play west coast time and I live in the east coast, but anyway I love watching u guys but It really pisses me off when u guys lose games on the road because of the way we have played this season. Nice to talk to u if u are reading, I would love to come to a game one day but don't have the money. Hate the grizzles!!
Dray flexin his accolades on that bum dillion brooks is hilarious 😂😂
Draymond, come to LA sooner than later to play. We would love to have your talent on the Lakers! I love the video, keep up the good work. I especially love the part on giving grace. Stay blessed brother.
In response to you talking about road losses, All I heard was excuses. Draymond this is the first time I’ve heard you give your opponents so much praise. We need you to lead this group despite what happed in the past. Road games is a mind set. Get it done!!!!  Gold Blooded 💯
Absolutely cooked this clown Dillon Brooks😭😭
You guys are going to come together and be so awesome it’s just a matter of time 🥰 the show best wishes on good health to everyone and a great close into the playoffs and on Let’s Go Warriors turn up guys get the job done 💙💛❤️💪💪
"I've seen fans cheer at somebody's injury" That's for you Raptors fans 😭
Wiggins coming back when?
13:11 Dray you are dead wrong. If a regular person waived on gun in a club like that. they are so scrutinized by police and likely lose their job and maybe be incarcerated. Ja Morant had the NBA protection but it went away as Ja wants to be known as a thug.
Say it ain’t so draymond you quit on your team 😢
Draymond "Quite Frankly" Green
Quite frankly is really the MVP of this pod
Man dray you hit on head with the tee Morant situation
if we ever change the face of nba, it will 100% steph curry. no question asked
Quite Frankly! This phrase needs to be paid royalties to SAS!
Great response dray
Tell ‘em Dray!!! 🗣️
The thing about Dillon is, he’s not well liked by most of the NBA players anyway, so Dray is basically saying everything most players are either thinking or saying about him amongst each other.😂😂😂 I loved every word Dray said.👏🏽👏🏽
Hopefully Ja will listen to Dray as he moves forward.
16:45 dra ummm that’s your biggest regret? Not punching your young guy your rookie in the face?
man                              your attitude                          killing                                   your                          team.      should have been suspended after you assaulted you teammate months ago.
Yo from a grizz fan. Well said dray. Love the content.
Did his job indeed
U need help homeboy
Draymond said shooting numbers lol like see yours and it’s ok to be in a great system and situation and 4 rings don’t make YOU a great player you was a good player on a great team and got accolades because of it but Dillion do suck lol
Take a shot every time Dray says "Quite Frankly."
I heard ja wanted to get traded to golden state
Can you try line up an interview with Steven Adams at one point? I feel like you two would have a great yarn
I completely agree with what he said about  Ja, however,  just to point out that we all selectively pick who we are more graceful and forgiving towards to and so does Draymond. Btw, how he destroyed Dillon Brooks was just brilliant
YOU CAN TAKE ME OUT THE HOOD NOT THE HOOD OUT OF ME. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT DRE.
The diff between Ja and regular folks is that Ja being a ball player has got handouts of not getting in trouble. If it were a regular Joe, he would got felonies so quick. Which prevent u from getting hired damn near everywhere, taking away your livelihood. Thats why people are upset and saying they should take his pay and kick him out. Ball players can get away with a lot more things that normally a regular joe would go to jail for
follow u since day 1.. please win the champion, nothing else matter. write this in the history book
Dray I  know u are a great person nuff love bro.
This is how you discipline your son
This was his shot to take accountability for that play. Smh Dray
13:40 This right here is the part of Draymond that not enough people outside the Bay understand. This is just a phenomenal man with a perspective that needs to be appreciated.
Dray saying that we don’t know Ja enough but what he did and the things he’s been accused of reflects his personality 🤷🏾‍♂️ everyone makes mistakes but how many NBA players get on live and showcase a gun? How many NBA players are being accused assaulting a minor ? How many NBA players been accused of pointing lasers (possibly guns)  to their opponents buses? Let’s not act like these negative comments came out of nowhere or is a one time incident.
Draymond you made some great points.  Remember we the fans have our own opinion too.  When will you come out and tell us exactly why you hit Poole?   Your mother raised a successful young black man too, who turned and hit hit teammate.  Why????
You guys not seeing it? They are losing on purpose so that they get  to play Memphis in the playoffs..warriors know that’s an easy pass to the second round but they must stick to Memphis whether it means losing or winning to stay in pace.
Draymond hes already dead :(
He was throwing shade and was talking about Shannon  21:21
Get em Draaaayyy lol!
We definitely don't wanna see Chris rock bruh
Anybody got the time stamp on when he talks about brooks? No way I can survive 20+minutes of this
Hope brooks bring strap to pop that pimple 🤣🤣🧠💥
The dynasty starts after you. Not with you. WOW Dramond. WOW. I felt that burn from SOCAL.
I can’t lie I’m With draymond on that brooks shit brooks a 🤡
You should’ve talked about why you acted like a crybaby cus Jordan poole didn’t pass you the ball
im from asia and i follow and read about my idol, draymond green for almost 10 years now. you are such a leader and a leader with fighting spirit. i am interested to listen about one of the post here that you gave up on one play JP did not pass the ball to you. as a leader myself, although not in sports, we can not give up no matter what. as leaders, reality is, we can not chose our personnel 100% but we need to carry the weakest links and guide them
This dude a NBA Champ and that’s the best mic he can get?
I know? Y can’t we win in the road….😢
DAMN - Draymond wants all the smoke. BEFORE the game?? Wow.
"I think I'm an incredibly great person" 👍 👌 😌  stay humble king .... God, what a joke this guy is
Draymond “quite frankly” Green
Well spoken. And I suggest don't figure out the road struggles. You have to accept that yall have been bad on the road so far regardless of what happened. However you can change that going forward. Golden state embodies winning. You are the 6th seed and really have a realistic shot at still moving up to 2nd seed. Postseason is 0-0 to start. My question still a healthy gsw, who can beat them 4 games. I'll wait because I'll have to see it to believe it. Yeah okc on a random night can w8n a game. But with pressure and the opponent can study you is completely different.
Draymond just tell him tomorrow night you don't give a fck 😂
Draymond is losing credibility. Didn't bring up the reason he didn't act like a leader and left his team hanging.
Dray is right.. Erbody sayin "that ain Ja" "he tryin to be a thug" "he ain't like that".. none of us don't know.. all we know is that he's showing us he is like det.. not good but true
Draymond doesn't think your broke ass would get fired from your crap job for flashing a gun on your social media. 😆
I fw draymond off the court I was in Boston when he hoisted the trophy 🏆 although I’m a Lifelong Celtics fan ,I stayed and watched the ceremony and applauded them , I was pissed when some of the fans booed during the ceremony, I was like damn you don’t have to like or even applaud them but you have to Respect them they won the Championship
Dillon 🤡👌
Get off the podcast draymond and get focused  and locked  in defensively .the media wil try to blame you for not being able to repeat this season instead  of the league catching up to our style of play ?
Stay up draymond! Love the content brotha
They play against each other tomorrow too😂 this should be interesting
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 GET’EM
Too bad Green can't score a basket...... If he could i'm pretty sure that would help winning on the road...... But I guess that's what happens when you can't play offense. You have to really play defense. You gotta have some kind of niche or you'll get cut from the NBA. 16:30 really....didn't you punch Poole loosing your temper...and again when Poole didn't give you the ball...Not like you'd score anyway.   I remember when you didn't pass KD the ball.   Who would you rather shoot the ball KD or Green with the clock running down?
Real talk about tee morant 💯
maybe they need to be only half decent this year and not go far into the playoffs, in order so klay and steph can reflect and think "maybe we do want that 5th ring, to equal some of the greatest teams of the past".
Wise words from the 4 time NBA CHAMPION!
How are guns the issue, seriously being nice here. It’s a Ja issue
Quiet frankly I like your commentary
God I love this man, he speaks volumes.
Dillon Brooks needs someone to lay him out. Shannon Sharpe's available to do that job.
Tell ‘em MF’s Dray! History will show. Dubs!
Draymond and the Warriors clearly know they are positioning themselves for 6th seed. They don't want that smoke woth the Suns and KD in a 1st round match up.
calling him a fan is hilarious
Say what you want about Dray but he do got 4 rings and is the defending nba champ. Of course not as the best player but his presence is definitely felt. He ain’t just a bus rider on a winning team.
Dubs locker room is jacked.  It's the only way to explain.  Team is broken.   Think klay was correct,  it's a privilege to play in the NBA, make millions of dollars.   If this group doesn't want to compete,  lacob will find players who do...hopefully, with Bob's guidance.
Why do I have this feeling that they gone want to square up somehow at tomorrows game at Memphis...and they both gone get techs and suspensions 🤦🏽😂 Dillon Brooks Garbage bruh🗑️
I can't stand this sucker ( D green )
cooking dillion  lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo im dieing
Yo Bro your energy is overflowing on this pod! I can feel the positivity coming off you already!
Your not as dark skinned as Cris Rock said Dray, nothing wrong with being dark skinned.
ok but dray calling dillion a fan lmao is the best i love you dray keep it up hahahahahah
Love this
Dray u a 4x champ and your in your feelings about D Brook 😂. U took that way too personal dog, not even worth that long of a response
Thank you, Draymon. CLOWNS 🤡  DON'T WORK  building a Dynasty.
It’s not a America’s fault if a black man isn’t successful in whatever he wants to do so dont say “America” like it’s someone else’s fault for a black man’s failure. I’m Hispanic and I know some Hispanic people who ain’t successful because of their own ACTIONS. If they felt like “America” was at fault, I’d tell them go back to mexico and see where that country will get them. But naw we’re now about holding ourselves accountable right? F outta here with that statement and emphasis like that.
Dray Ethered Dillon with straight facts 🥶
well.. Dillion and Draymond will be getting Techs tomorrow
Yooo.  People go after peoples jobs all The time.  For a lot less.        Woke culture.   If someone has a right opinion.    Mad ex.      People attack jobs all the time.     But I think he has to make example of.       Should you around with something that serious.   At a club.  Prob tipsy
Very arrogant DG.. U get paid because the fans..... Hope Gianis TTSOY !
Quite Frankly
And Draymond Green you and Steph Curry have it bad waving your arms when Jordan Poole party has the ball 🏀, I'm pretty sure sometimes that's irritating to Poole party but then sometimes you make it sometimes you don't sometimes Steph Curry makes it sometime he don't sometimes Jordan Poole make it sometime he don't so please just stop 🛑 doing that don't need Poole out there nervous where he can't make a basket, Draymond Green and Steph Curry the only ones that do that .🧐😠😱
Don’t worry about Dillon Brooks Draymond. You’re a 4x nba champion you got to prove nothing to that bum ahh ninja Dillon Brooks he’s a casual
@6:21 Dillion Brooks talk
Use this like button for how much times dreymond said “quite frankly”
Fucking murdered brooks RIP
21:12 I LOVE THE NEW MEDIA!  Draymond Green is authentic !! Let JA MORANT Be Extraordinary and Powerful in his life.
DG, "Quite frankly," I believe that some of the guys subconsciously believe that they can shift  gears when necessary and still win.  One possible reason is the  success at home.   I really hope that you all can get in gear simultaneously during the playoffs so that you can invite, once again, Chuck Barkley to the 2023 Warriors Invitational.
As much as I used to try to Not like you, you are tge shittt! So happy for your success.  And THIS was Very well said! Salute sweetie. (I'm a grandma). Lol
DRAMATIC Green🤣 "Text Ya Daddy" Stop acting like ya Momma🃏
This is when it starts to look crazy doing a podcast during the season. What happened to new media credibility. Address quitting on the play
6:40 Dillon brooks part.
bro I swear every single day some new bullshit comes out of Memphis. bunch of little boys over there trying to walk with men. grow tf up. stop talking. just play. talk when you mean shit, don't talk at men who have accomplished everything there is to accomplish.
JP might had become an irritant to those OG's Klay, dray and curry. Curry even throw his mouth guard. 😂
Choices and Consequences a constant everyday all day regardless of age, gender, race or financial status🙏💕
the warriors have the team to make it out the west. the warriors time and time again have proven that. however, the team chemistry really worries me. thats the main thing holding them back. i hope things get resolved, otherwise theyre not making it out the west. and really  the issue is between draymond and poole. can they at least reconcile professionally, on the court? thats the key.   look at the lakers. in my opinion, especially with bron out, the warriors should have beat them. but the lakers are UNITED right now and playing cohesively. i think draymond is mentally done with the team and wants out to LA. dunno, but its unfortunate cuz the warriors do have what it takes to make it out the west and maybe even win it all again. come on dray, get it done big dawg. hop off lebron lol
Dray arguing with the refs and giving up on plays is mentally draining on the team
You want to talk about everybody in the NBA but you quit on your team last night you don't want to talk about that New Media.
So...In Playoffs what happens  On Road ?
Dillion Brooks stepped right into this lmao
Draymond Green just stop 😂 ja Morant knew exactly what he was doing when he was doing it that's just face it he goes for bad period, he doesn't respect anyone at all including you ,🙄 plan simple he wants to be a hood rat judging 🧐 on  what he was giving us last , but then he's young 🌱 but Old enough to know and he's old enough to know exactly what he's doing and what he saying, just hope he finds himself before it's too late,it is what it is period.
Wish Draymond luck in his mission to elevate arrogant role players.
People know your emotions, your temper... you have to get over it. Also, I guess you harbor a lot of anger towards white people as every other BLM gang member. All lives matters bro, all lives matters...
Not gonna cap dray Dillon would win everything u mentioned in my Sunday league 😂
Draymond; I'm not even gonna read the comments. We aren't perfect, just forgiven. It's not on us to hate. It's them 2 forgiving each other. Word
As a Memphis fan I gt plenty respect for Draymond after this one 💯💯💯
Draymond really playing mental gymnastics and not holding Ja Morant accountable for being a clown
The way he calls Dillon Brooke a fan.. just know that is how they see each and every one of you lol don’t idolize these dudes they just play basketball
“1 less technical than your dumbass” 😂😂😂 gotta love Draymond
You're  a Vet still making mistakes 23 year olds are making and you clearly can't control your temper
Tell that scrub to have a pointless triple double. Then you can address DRAYMOND GREEN SUCKA
You gotta grow up bud.. I love the warriors and your one of my favorite players. But you gotta keep your cool. You should address the Poole situation. Maybe would have one if you didn’t throw a kid fit. Poole prob didn’t even see you.
Quite frankly.
One of the best shows Dray has done. First ballot...
In all fairness Ja Morant posted the gun on his IG, tweeter, fb, that's all on him his mistake but now he have to learn from his mistakes. Now that it's in the spotlight he have to change some things.
Man... Loved this episode..Best of Draymond so far for sure. Love from Kenya ✊
a millionaire shilling adds....
Why is the video separated with names like michael Jackson j cole etc etc
Draymond quit on plays and his team last night.   Never thought I would see that.  Very accountable at his presser last night too.
Draymond Green is a all time great why even respond to ugly ass brooks lol memphis teddy bears are a joke
This is hilarious. 💯💯💯💯👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
real meds champ!!!
I'm really not with the "new media" hype, but I do like his response to Dillon Brooks. Memphis needs to be broken up and spread out. Adams deserves better.
Rare Draymond W!! All my homies hate dillon brooks. He's a terrorist
Dray you’re hilarious bra 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dynasty starts after you....
Talk yo shyt Draymond!!!🤣💪💯
This guy is a narcissist lol
I respect ur reply to brooks. But not to the Ja situation.  People think he should lose it all is because being blessed with ur hard work is truly a blessing. Giving him that kind of money and he doesn’t seem to appreciate his position seems to be a waste. Many of us wish we were in a better situation financially and if I was? I would give back to the community and be a better role model to the young ones.  U are a good role model and appropriate ur position so u deserve to be where u’re at.  We like to see people being successful and we love seeing that they appreciate it by being a great role model.  We don’t like to see someone who is more then blessed not appreciate their position.  So yea I am one of those people who thinks he should lose it.  He can go play in Europe and maybe when he understand how to humble himself, he can come back and be a true role model and maybe a superstar.  The more money he gets without the right mind frame will only hurt him and have the people who look up to him get themselves hurt too.  Hey Ja….  Black Lives Matter to you?  Or is ur ego too big.  Putting millions of dollars in the wrong hands is like putting a gun in the wrong hands.  NFL player New England Patriots Hernandez ring a bell to anyone???
Quite frankly, Draymond, you might be traded to Memphis real soon 👀
Love watching you play basketball and listening to your podcast!!
Draymond: Knocks out his own teammate in practice, then proceeds to throw tantrum when that teammate doesn't pass him the ball.  Also Draymond: I think i'm an incredibly great person.
For brooks to speak on drays name is ridiculous.. brook averages 6 more points , 4 less rebounds , 3 less assist in his career.
I'm a warriors hater and it's a breath of fresh air seeing the warriors struggle like this. It's been 8 years of dominance, it's time to come back down to earth haha
DRAYMOND YOUR NOT IT NO MORE. Your known for more antics than your play. You had 1 rebound the other day. You’ve had one block just in one game and you got moved to C. I must be missing something. 😂 . Ngl bruh you trash now.
Temetrius morant gon come back soon. Man is gon taste full wrath of memes courtside now
Ive been taking this stance about Tee Morant since the news broke. All the same ppl that leaned into him and using him for camera time and celebrating him being supportive coming out the woodwork assuming that same man aint talk to HIS son but thats beside the point Ja 23,a father his damn self and got Ms in the bank… NOBODY on this earth can make him do anything. He gotta tighten up on his on volition.
Dillon Brooks is a clown. ...so is Draymand Green.  You may know what the problem is and are simply unable to correct it.
Draymond you’re gonna be on another team next season bum 🤡
Draymond “quite frankly” Green
Man everyone has gotten better around, you guys didn't change, ain't no chip this year.
Draymond really referred to everyone who isnt in pro sports as “common folks” 😂😂😂 bros ego is insane fr
Great content Money. Way to ether that fool. More importantly, great perspective on Ja and Tee Morant. Society needs more people who think.
Dillon brooks shooting 39% from the damn field
Go Kings! Light the MF beam! Our Dynasty has just begun. Go Kings!
From a defensive minded perspective (my favorite player is Ben Wallace). I absolutely love that Draymond is a Warrior. Watching this man routinely stop 1 on 2, 1 on 3 fastbreaks is just ridiculous. Just like Steph has made playing offense look so easy, Dray has done the same on the defensive side. It's been a joy and an honor to watch this team play basketball. Cheers 🍻
Dray gone next season
responding and dropping right before playing memphis is why i fwu boy 💪🏽
Welcome to the Dilion Brooks memorial,we just started
He’s not the only one that has acted this way about pooles decision making. He shouldn’t give up on the play but he’s human. And he’s a grown ass man. He knows when he is wrong and only has to address it with who ever he wants
Dray needs to have a show called "Quite Frankly"
Great broadcast my Saginaw brother
Man everybody preaching to or about Ja is getting old and corny. Get off y’all high horses lol and miss me with this “black man in America “ line Lmao
I feel it you want your flowers Dray but you’re spending too much time talking about this clown. You shouldn’t be affected by this words affect women and children not men. And Lions don’t care about the opinions of sheep. You tryna save face and say how important you are to the team, people who know basketball know how important you are. So start being that
DUDE HAS A LOT OF NERVE SEEING HOW EMOTIONAL HE IS!
Do I agree with Draymond, Matt Barnes, Stak, and JJ that Draymond is a future HOF? Of course. I trust their perspectives over mine. Do I believe I have even 1% of their understanding? Of course not. Brooks is just yapping. I hope Brooks knows he's lying.
Please God, we want gsw vs grizzlies in the playoffs. 🔥 🍿
Hey Draymond, maybe there’s a time and place to address that odd misunderstanding (or temper tantrum) with JP regarding that play, but we’d like to know your take.
This man team falling apart, just got beat by fucking OKC, just walked off the court because his little feelings was hurt that the teammate he punched wouldn’t pass him the ball but he sitting here spending his energy talking about Dillion Brooks😂
They don't like each other cuz theyre the same type of player. Both very vocal and really good defenders. Chips aint everything, cuz if that was the case robert horry would be better than giannis, which isnt true.
the whole ja part was perfect.
draymond and brooks play the same roll and averages the same amount of points,the only difference is dillion light skin
my goodness this is a Dillon Brooks funeral service....gawd damn 😭
Draymond "quite frankly " Green
You sure all your teammates fw u draymond 🤣🤣keep it a 100
Nice job Draymond you handle yourself well on this podcast
Warriors don't rebound or play D.
Hit 'em with the 'champ'.
Dray is a C+ player on a A+++ organization
Who remembers when Brooks was talking shit about Iggy when Iggy was shipped there as part of a trade. Buyouts or “sit outs” happen all the time but why did Brooks have an issue with Iggy.
Draymond chose violence today 😂
Say what you want but Draymond is a decorated and accomplished basketball player. I low key forgot bout the gold medals 🥇 😅
I think the Grizzles should have picked up Miles Bridges. He can shoot, rebound, pass, dunk and inside threat. He could be the Grizzles extra double digits scorer. I think you playing center takes away from your facilitating for Steph. That's our special sauce. Steph helping rebound is making his legs tired in the 4th quarter. All contending teams have a true big man; Jokic, Steven Adams, Valanunias, Giannis, R Williams, and Embiid.  I thought it was hilarious after the loss last night. The main thing media saw was you walk away from the play. That not why the game was lost. Sure because of the punch, media was going to try to connect the two. What I saw was the 17 free throws the Thunder shot. The Warriors interior was compromised. The ref giving J Poole a technical for bouncing the ball to him. Now you can't show or act with emotion when the refs call a foul on you. Wiggins, GPII, Otto Porter Jr and Mike Brown the Warriors defensive threat are gone or not playing like last year. When the Warriors swing/swing the ball playing Warriors basketball moving the defense they normally win. If the Warriors could pickup a backup center. What if you or Looney get injured in the playoffs/finals?       Trash Talk    🏆 🏆 23 🏆 🏆         GO GREEN     Technical       Maybe      Winner     Definitely       Green  Unapologetically   FLAWED DONT             23 STOP SUCCESS        FLAWED        ☁️23 🌞    BUT GRACE
Damn when draymond was going over his resume I was like “is bro the GOAT?”
"Absolutely Incredible" has been replaced with "Quite Frankly"
How many times did he say Quite Frankly ?? 😅🤣 I counted 92
Donovan Mitchell beat him up! Good Louisville kid.
Ja is just a 23yo kid and life has come fast at him. He needs to learn and grow up for sure, but yes.... Grace ...
50 games at the very least Day-Day.  50 games at the least.  Ja failed where so many people in his position have succeeded.  It's in the rules for a reason and everyone since Gilbert Arenas and before Ja has been able to follow that rule.  $200M+ contract, the NBA, Nike and Poweraide at his finger tips, and he couldn't keep his mind right, when so many people with less opportunity have been able to.  What does that say to those people if Ja doesn't receive some form of extended punishment from this.  Put food on their family's table?  The kid made $39M in the last 4 years.  Even if you factor in the tax, that's $20M+.
Huge Dubs fan. Y’all have given us fans and the entire NBA the greatest near past decade ever. Having a slightly off year after a championship don’t mean nothing in the long run! Legends among legends! 🔥🔥✌🏼🤙🏻
Dillon got burned hard lmao
When Draymonds not punching a teammate he's meditating😅right😅
Draymond if a everyday person was caught waving a gun for no apparent reason on social media that person would be fired the next day. You and many other athletes are out of touch with reality and with everyday working class people.  I couldn't go to work punch my co worker in the face and keep my job not to mention not getting criminal charges  You seem to think all criticism is bad. Your wrong. Constructive criticism is necessary for personal growth. Smh.
Dude the reaction when Pool didn't pass the Ball to DG it just looked like a mad high-school kid. Green should be more professional and not react like a spoiled kid.
The Tee Morant part is pure gospel
What's your Response To Chris Rock??
everything is cool but Draymond acting like nba players and regular people get paid the same lol 13:38
Why you throwing tantrums on the court and giving up on the play big dawg? Own up to it and “stand on that” you’re always being watched. You gotta be better.
Dray, this episode was FIRE!! 🔥 maybe your best. Not just your words, but your heart, your self reflection, and your thoughtful demeanor. Being critical is not always a bad thing if it’s well-intentioned and accurate. Thank you, bro!
Example you punched Poole in face that could’ve been “mistake” heat of the moment I get that but whoever posted it online that wasn’t a mistake they purposely posted that for the world to see you get what I’m saying it’s just not the same thing when you incriminate yourself especially when you’ve already got alleged gun incidents these young niggas need guidance
All facts
I love how he ripped Brooks.
Draymond you are a clown
Dray really crucified Dillion Brooks LMAO. Golden Response!
i thought i heard it wasn´t worth responding back to brooks haha
Unc would beat his… (Brooks)
Dray is one of the best to ever do it! A true leader and I hope Ja see’s this as he is in a privileged position to learn and grow from this situation. Coming from the A to see the Dub’s send the Bucks back home with a L to hold!!
You know the dubs really going thru it when dray spends this much time on Dillon brooks 😭
Yo grace and mercy is what he’s getting no charges still in the nba but if he doesn’t change his he could make a bigger mistake that grace won’t cover he gotta move smarter that’s just real talk and if he doesn’t he will have to face wat comes with it he has to do his part that’s not judging he posted that gun online not me you’ve never did it and yea you’ve made “mistakes” but some things are just not smart period
😂😂😂😂 skip called it
Dillon Dynasty Brooks
Most of what Dylan Brooks said is totally valid and true, that is why Dray takes it so personally. Draymond would not have the standing in the league that he has or would have had anything close to the career he had on any other team than the warriors, that seems like a quite obvious fact. Also i really dont like that take that fans have no clue about basketball, many analysts and informed fans have a better clue than most players. Beeing a good Soldier does not make you a good General and many of the most knowledgable basketball people never played on a professional level.
Focus on your game man. You need help. You gotta go next year...you quit on your team
they talk to much for team that went nowhere.  remind me of the Sacramento queens . talking  shit about lakers
be real tho, do you actually think youd be a 4 time all star if you were on the pistons or magic this whole time?
Excellent episode. Great points where made as usual. Appreciate the time you take putting these podcasts together.   Hope to see an episode with Allen Iverson. I’m sure his personality well mesh well with you
Way to represent yourself, your family, MSU, and The Town, Draymond Green. I see why Damian Lillard loves you like a brother.
Bruh that’s not a mistake the nigga stupid what other face of a league posts a gun online there is none the fact is he’s had plenty of examples of how to move but he letting the clout mean more then real life and that’s on him we can’t baby people that’s his problem now everybody handling him with kid gloves he’s a grown ass man shit at 23 I already had felonies in my jacket don’t blow your opportunity
Ima Memphis fan and I completely agree with draymond and I’m dying for that bum to leave the team can’t even lie ‼️💯
The Dillon Brooks response starts at 6:25
Take accountability for your awful body language and leadership yesterday. You’re on record of saying you have no motivation to get up and play against bad teams, and now it’s showing in games. Cant happen.
Draymond, I have to update you.  Dennis Rodman was a clown, too.
Draymond, a player that has definitely played above his skills and expectations, you have to give him that, yet, a guy that does not realize how lucky he was in having landed in the organization he landed on and a player that thinks of himself much more higher than what he is.
He said if I were on another team u wouldn't be nothing.... Draymond u duck that part
He didn’t address the Poole thing?
how self aware of Draymond to talk about why he knows his teams love playing with him
Yo Draymond did you knock Poole out again after last nights game?
Addressing Dillion and the Grizzlies over the teammate altercation is hilarious. If they played like they play when the Grizzlies are around they wouldn’t be fighting near the play in.
Bro left the court to record a podcast... boy avg more podcast then buckets
Holla about that thing in last night game again OKC...
You wasted time off your life’s clock responding to someone the won’t remember in 20yrs as far as basketball. Focus young bro
It’s simple No Gary Payton jr this season that’s why y’all can’t win on the road mistake not resigning him luckily y’all got him back
How many times can I say “quite frankly” 🤔 lmao
Burn 🔥🔥🔥
U both role players  nothing to  brag about
I was waiting on Draymond to address that ja situation. Your advice was the best n most thoughtful. Most the other professionals opinions were trash 🗑️
Great advise Dre
Drink everytime he says "quite frankly"
“Quiet frankly” is stuck in my head now, might start using it, sounds good
Grace, some dignity for yourself
this mf is actively commentating his own reality show.
I LOVE THIS !!!!! THIS IS GOLD
I would definitely take advice from draymond.
Green. Is. The. Realist
Dillion Brooks Draymond speaking facts you in his head. However,  the defense is not hitting this yr😅😂😀
Your perimeter defense to protect the interior is horrific.   And quit shooting the 3 ball until you establish the mid range.     Thats all
Watching Jordan  poole play he takes a lot of bad shots . Turns the ball over  way too much .
I hate ppl bring up game 5. Like bruh yall had two games to win 1. But great content as always
I really like the team they have put together in OKC and think they have a bright future
Yal gotta relax just because he ain’t speak on the shit he did in the game on this episode don’t mean he won’t speak on it at all shit he might just make a whole episode about just that🤷🏾‍♂️dray know he was wrong he gone address it like he do everything else good and bad 💯I’m still rockin with u dray fuck what they saying everybody gotta opinion
12:18 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mane I fuck with Dray 🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
These comments acting like yall are coaches, psychologists, and therapists for Dray off one bad moment that we really haven't seen from him ever so I dont doubt that the reactions will fortify his game more and young guys like JP DDV JK and more. Dubs vs 76ers/Bucks Finals with Dubs in 5/6. Let's get this chip!
Draymond “Quite Frankly” Green
Good thoughts regarding Ja & Tee Morant. I hope he doesn’t lose generational wealth negating all the family has done to help him get here.
Trash talk is good and all, but people should have a certain level of introspection. They shouldn't be talking that much when they haven't won anything
Who watches this dude?!!
Quite frankly
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 The response to Brooks.  Guys who talk about Day Day and saying that he cant play or would not be good on another team....... that's when you have to question guys basketball IQ
Wish you had addressed that fit you threw last night   On a positive note this trash talk w Dillon Brooks is funny 🤣 memphis talks too much for a team that barely made it out of the first round
U take joy in the crowd I believe. Your playstyle caters to "joy" and being free to make mistakes....I would be interested to see if u do better where ur fans are present on the road
Bro you always make a lot of sense when you speak…..BIG UPS. And also forget all the haters man. Keep pushing and you already know like I do it’ll come together real soon for the rest of the season. PEACE
Basketball players should be held to a higher standard when children look up to them and players make millions of dollars from them.
“Quite frankly” with Draymond Green
you had one rebound and 0 in 2nd half. we need rebounds
I think he said it well, you’d hope that Tee is still trying to guide Ja, but he’s 24 years old and worth millions of dollars. If Ja doesn’t want to listen he’s not going to listen.   The only people that are probably getting through to him are his friends, teammates, and some OGs he looked up to from the NBA.
Dub nation will always be behind you, Dray! I hope things turn around, don’t forget that it’s the leaders of the team’s job to be the tone-setter. Was frustrating to see how you acted on the court yesterday, especially when we know you’re capable of so much more
Stop mixing up regular fans, with people who make casual but polarizing Twitter takes.  Sure, we might not know as much as you, but as someone who has watched for decades, I know quite a bit. Could I coach a team?  Of course not.  But to act like a person who watches the game day in and day out, for years and cares about the game doesn't know what they are looking at is wild.  We understand most of the media is "entertainment", and people on Twitter just say wild stuff to get attention, or their really young. But I don't think that is the majority. There isn't this secret science to the game. lol Outside of not knowing specific plays, its fairly easy to follow the game, and understand why each persons role is important. Online you're always going to get the most polarizing takes devoid of nuance.  But no matter how much we think it is, Twitter isn't a fair representation of anything in reality.  And I think its completely fair and valid to ask for grace on Ja's behalf.  But it is a bit tone deaf to act like the "average person" gets any grace.  Usually a lack of funds and connections screw you over far more than doing the same crime but being rich and famous.  It's why a large percentage of rich people legitimately feel invincible.  It would ruin the average persons life, and this simply could only ruin his NBA career.  Which is still terrible, but not the same. Dude could never touch a basketball again, invest his money he already has and be set for life.  The average person doesn't have that safety net or luxury to fall back on.
This is why i will never back down saying that Dray should not leave or be gone in a Warriors jersey, often too much he is always complains about the refs call on the court. And thats sometimes iritates me, i want him to ball because he is soooo good at it esp in the defensive area. BUT being in this new media as a player whoa he is surely surely has a talent with words. The way he talks you want to hear from him more because he talks honestly.
Dillon got cooked
Dillon Brooks got COOKED. I hope they don't get techs next game.
The cloud 🌧️ in the locker room is still there. That’s why our road record is so bad. It’s easy to win, vibe out and play with joy at Chase because the home crowd the energy and the familiarity. On the road means you actually have to do things as a team. The division within the locker room is apparent. The cohesiveness at home is not there on the road. Pretty obvious.
I’m a warriors fan and for some reason I can’t see Dray and Poole playing together next season . Seems like too much to overcome
Keep improving champ.
can't quit on the team bro, even if jp be making stupid mistakes sometimes. gotta be a leader and you pulled a LeGiveUp on us
Dray, I’m one of your biggest supporters but your actions spanning back to the off-season and the Poole incident is just making you more and more likely to not be a Warrior next year. Get right or your gonna be the next Westbrook
with this looses you helping the lakers
Grace! Amen!
TEAM USA legit
New media dont take accountability I see
Quite Frankly
Forget these guys Draymond! Load the content bro, load the content! 💪💪💪💯  P.s they made me sensor this comment 🤣🤣🤣

Cant stand you and your egotistic attitude Warriors will be better without you and your will be expose just like russ
Love you dray, but KD and Kyrie hitting the west and the metal and spiritual glue not being there with the dubs its getting a bit deep g. Like You cannot give up on the play, yes jordan should have passed the ball so it could get set up, but you gotta show that mental fortitude AND DONT YOU DARE GET ANOTHER TECH G!!! no suspension fuck that drama
Wow my man’s not even a true adult in addressing the fit he threw. I actually have lost some RESPECT for you my guy
When Draymond don't know why they're losing on the road, then the season's over lol
7:40 Draymond made me feel old, I was in junior high when the Warriors won their first title in 2015, now I’m a junior in college 😱
LETS DISCUSS JORDAN POOLE, DRAY-DRAY
dray does get away with 100 moving screens a game
Just keep playing and you guys will be my champion, again love Dub nation from ur fan in Buffalo NY
Draymond seems annoyed, and angry. Not a good VIBE!!! Don't give up Dray!
More worried about the shit happening with other teams than the way he acted against the thunder 💀

Let’s hear you address your hissy fit over Jordan Poole not passing you the ball. You can’t just give up on a play, man. You’re fighting to stay out of the play in. And you’re supposed to be a team leader.  Edit: Trade Poole after this god-awful string of playoff performances.
The more I watch the volume the more it’s becoming one of my favorite channels. Love listening to these pros  and hearing stuff directly from them. Gonna be cool to see where this network goes in a few years 🗣️
Blessed love my brother watching from St Lucia 🇱🇨
