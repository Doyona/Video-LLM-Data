😂
Hahahha just stumbled onto this.......I'll need to forward this to my kids.
this is what your thymus does
I think that’s just a lazy immune system
my immune system after me staying up late almost every day: f*ck we are screwed
The fact that the White Blood Cell wears a Shirt that says                                 ✔                  _JUST DO IT_
Just finished an A&P exam about the immune system. Damn I should have watched this to study.
You can tell the bacteria ain't playing these games
T cells shirt:Just do it T cells-do I have too?
Nobody in Lucas way: Lucas: MOVE OUT THE WAY
CASE MINE NOW Hey you cant touch that MOVE OUT DA WAY
Fun fact: T cells get stronger when you laugh
To be fair, no bacteria WANTS to kill your body, it just isn't designed to work in it, it needs you alive
White cells help me
I just stopped being sick and now I am sick again bacterial really hate me-
I actually get bad for the immune system-
Germ gang
Being too good at avoiding diseases makes ur immune system weak as hell so just 1 flu might aswell kill you
Police: what the-
Nah when you have a weak immune system those T-cells simply don’t exist are not very many
Strong immune systems: *YOU IN THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL*
Lmaoo
T cells!
When u have bad asthma and asthma attacks daily u get used to ur body being messed up
Is this dude a doctor???
Can we appreciate that we learn something just by watching these comedy videos 😂
Lol he's wearing a just do it and the other guy is like do it
The immune system when the body is under attack:❌❌ Vs When and allergy enters the body:👁👁
B-Cells : Im about to end this mans whole career.
Meanwhile my immune system: so let me get this straight.  This "covid" thing is going to stay?   Brain: yep  Immune system: ............that's it that's it I'm done playing doctor here. It's time we had help  Brain: you're not suggesting what I think you're suggesting   I.S.: we have no choice
The cells at work live action adaptation doesnt seem so bad 😅
Literally my stomach every day :)
I ganna send a tank front on bactirias
He used his strength just for us he’s a real person
Exactly I have a weak immune system and I am sick every other week
It would be funny if he was moving then got the idea to make that video 😂
The irony of white blood cells' t shirt saying: just do it!"
SCATTER !! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
lmao loudmouth
I laughed so hard when he left with that box😂
Bacteria: enters my body My immune system: *shoots the bacteria to death immediately*
Wow the bacteria have some white shoes and I only have gray shoe
NWell he’s dead if they take both of the bones from his legs
When the Bacteria came in my friend started texting me-
on the white blood cell's T-shirt says just do it 😂🤣
I like how it sau just do it and hes not doing anything
I’m quite the opposite. My immune system is so strong that i have asthma for 2 weeks and the virus for 2 days.
Fun fact: Did you know he called that person t cells cause not only he's supposed a cell but because he's wearing a T shirt??   Ik im dumb
The Bacteria  straight boot ganged everything lol
I love how the white blood cell's shirt literally said "JUST DO IT" and yet he refuses
So Bacteria out here playing Book Games in my body?!?!?!
Him wearing "just do it" while unwilling to do shit.
Would they be bigger and more muscle
What about strong immune system
Lol
I cant stop watching these videos lol
Looks like this is exactly what happens in my body lol
Me realizing that they cared a couch for the video
My immune system is the complete opposite of this I get sick for a day or a couple hours and I’m good to go
This is similar to the anime cells at work
You are just adorable, really funny, very cleaver & creative with your presentations, and you’re obviously very intelligent. Thanks for doing these wonderful videos!
What's with the red booby thing?
Me who ate all those orange slices in a really big bowl two years ago: Pathetic

Fun fact: he filmed this while he was moving.
Why are you in the garage

Glad to know that my white blood cells are lazy af
Imagine him as ur bio teacher... I would go every fucking day lmao
Heyy
Lucas carried the video
F
Lucas looking for some stuff to steal again

This actually is funny but I'm not laughing because if I do it's going to be hard to breathe because I'm sicker than an ex.  Mi louse braeth

The bacteria really went FBI OPEN UP!!!!
He must've actually been moving otherwise that would be hell to put everything back
The most epic crossover in human history

As someone on immunosuppressants and also naturally immunocompromised, I feel so called out! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
God is real amen God
Legit what fibromyalgia is, chronic fatigue and pain wreck hell on the body
Some motivational quotes: just do it! Me: yes, yes I will Sleep
the police in middle eastern countries:
That bacteria is definitely from Chicago
Plot twist: he actually shifting but wanted a help frm his frnds
My system be like: BRING LUCAS BACK
Video suggestion: what happens when you play Among us
Haha lol so this is what happens in my body?😂
Bacteria: I'm not playing these games!
Somewhat immunocompromised person here:  This is so accurate! 🥴
Me:*Have weak looking wimpy body* My immune system:*STRONK*
Iver this or they try to fight and t cells cant win
Human Cell: T Cells Do Somethin T Cells: I'm Tired Bring Them Over  Human Cells: Were Gonna Be In Fected!
Me: watching with a strong immune system Also me: 👁👄👁
Respect for him to move his stuff out of the house just for a skit
All I think of is osmosis Jones
I have found my new favorite channel
“Haha yes yes”
I am like that T cell but my immune system is very good
Plot twist: his friends actually raided him and he recorded it
Aye bro when is big mouth making new videos, like ‘IM NOT PLAYING THESE GAMES’ his content is really good
So that's were lucas went
One of when you take immune support pills 💊 😂
The way lucas just ran out 😂

These videos make sence
This new season of cells of work looks great
My mom is a doctor and i am 9 so i can impress her with this information
This kind of reminds me of Pokémon in such a way when you traded pokemon then they disobey you
W collab 🙌
Music?
I love how his shirt says JUST DO IT
Am I the only one who noticed lucas
LUCAS
"What is this? I DONT CARE ITS MINE NOW!" "Hey you can't touch that!" "I DONT CARE ITS MINE!"  -Me when I find something random laying around
The funniest bacteria is that big hair guy wearing a glass😂
When do the B cells get involved
Lol, he was sleep
Ironic since the white blood cell clothes says JUST DO IT
My daughter has an weak system
devios lick
You should do azma next
My mom said that I have a strong immune system because I rarely get sick and if I do it goes away after a day
"Scatter!"
This dude is one of the greatest humans to live
Man just made a video about his friends helping him move out.
That will be me if i was a T cell
What really happens when you wash your hands
Actually when the low-inmune body is infected, the body self-destruct...
If I eat corn I don't digest it
Hard stop Lucas does such a good job XD
The way this man Lucas dipped out the door
Tcells need a break😭😭😭
Make skit on what happens when we take alcohol
I'm glad God made me as a human, not as a white-blood cells in a human body. I'm so lazy af and I would feel bad for whoever own me as their white-blood cells.
It’s hard stop lucas
Should do one on lupus, it's an auto immune disease where basically the bodies immune system attacks normal healthy tissue
Grove street
So bacteria also infected my wallet
In my case theres an dude with an fully loadet mg Sitting waiting for becteria to enter just to blast them XD i never get sick
There's now way he just moved a sofa for a skit
"move out the way" When there's nobody even there💀💀💀
I just want to say I can heal cuts fast
Why is my immune system so lazy 😔😔😔
Just sprint swim and look up, thank me later
IS THAT METROO VINES?!
Me:
I like how he says T cells despite the fact that T cells dont take care of bacterial infection so this is sorta legit.
Brilliant
Ngl, I'd steal that rotary phone too
sooo thatsss what happened when I got sick
Literally me:
My immune system is as strong as the hole planet I haven't been sick in 5 years
Does anyone else notices that T-Cell’s shirt says just do it but he’s not doing anything about the infection? Lol
That's me
T cells is literally me everyday and I love that
This is the equivalent of what happens to my fringe when my cousins come over
This is what happens when you aren't exposed to enough germs.
I just wanna see this remade for when Lucas grabs to box, he says “DONT STEAL MY DISHSOAP, DAVID!”
I love everything about this 😂
Oof
Every day in Birmingham Alabama
What is the music When the bateria come in?
This is an accurate representation of me 😅😅
When hard stop lucas gonna upload a vid
Make the inverse so I can finally send nerdy shit my friend completely understands.
JUST DO IT YOURSELF😀
They’re like my sister
DRUG GANG I’m dying🤣🤣🤣
God , the T cell is actually annoying.
The guy running out with the tote sounded like Lil John
What if Sans was a White Cell:
Do "when you have a strong immune system"
I have a strong immune system like a Thanos strong immune system. If I get sick it only lasts for a whole 24 hours, after that I'm up and running again!
My body like that
I like how the t-cell's t shirt says just do it
Lucas sounded like Lil John when he said DONT CARE ITS MINE NOW
This is simillar to cells at work
whatever Lucas touches, it belongs to him now.
Me:
GoodShit
Lucas: oh whats this DONT CARE ITS MINE NOW . Department : hey you cant take that . Just amagine lucas saying : i just did BYE
Autoimmune disorder gang ASSEMBLE!!!
Bro I never knew I was a t cell
Where helper T cells?
The fact the T cells shirt is JUST DO IT
My immune system is basically the exact opposite of this I never get sick even the coronavirus only gave me a headache and minor symptoms
Ok T Cells is on his break
I have a verry strong immune system I was exposed to COVID like 10 times and never caught it once
LUCAS
POV: He is actually getting prepared to move out during this vid
Plot twist: this was a more fun way to move stuff out of there garage
LUCAS💀
The rest 2 bacteria stealing kinda slow Lucas: ZZKDGKGDSGUSLHUSGLGDYOFSPUD WHATS THIS I DONT HECKING CARE ITS MINE NOW WUAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH -Lucas the bacteria escapes- The rest 2: man what the hell?!-
I live hardstoplucas
Its even better that his shirt says “just do it.”
←§
Just imagine if this was posted when he moved houses
Looks like will Smith
*"whats this?? I DONT CARE ITS MINE NOW!"*
My immune system attacks my connective tissues one of these where the body cell goes “t cell wtf are you doing?” As T cell hammers on ligaments and goes “isn’t this a foreign body?” Would be funny
Lol i had 1 throat infection for 1 week then after 3 weeks i got another one but that was bec of my wobbly tooth
Bi
I watch this and I'm sick 😂
The guy in the dreads is the life of the party
That look in his face "Nice place ya got here" 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Villagers iq is high but just the fact that their scammers
I have a really strong immune system
what happens when you have a very strong immune system
*I DON'T CARE WHAT THIS IS BUT ITS MINE NOW >:D*
The fact that he won't do anything and his shirt literally says just do it
I think the virus would be more succesful being a furniture moving company
Fun fact: his friend and him is moving to a new house
On the right is that who i think it is?
I find it funny his shirt says just do it
White cell:"ugh can you bring them over to me??
This is my favorite one
LOUD MOUTH
I have cvs so I have a weak immune system so this is pretty accurate
Can you you do a thing called ITP
Cells at work: Hood warfare
Neighbors just see this
So apparently eating mud as a kid makes your body's immune system really buff and trained in fighting.
Haha that's my body now.
Stuff taken represent your body's healthy tissue after they turn to muchos.,puss.,get it!?
My sister immune system getting sick verry fast but the sickness is berry fast.  My immune system is get sick slowly but the sickness is war f.uc.k.i.ng worse then my sister!!!!!!

Step 1: take cold showers    Step 2: stay consistent     Step 3: your wim hof
Neighbor be like : is that a robbery or is that one of that zoom pranks where he's getting rob by his friends or its just a untreathening robbery
Unrelated, but am I the only one who thinks the Like Animation when double tapping is incredibly satisfying?
This is the anime "Cells at Work" but live action honestly 🤣 (This should be a Netflix show)
Lol relatable btw what’s an immune system
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. Matthew 22:37 KJV.
Yes😐
😂😂😂😂😂
You should do a vid on when you take pills to help out your immune system
Sad story of my life
Love the phone.
I have a really good immune system       (Idk if anyone cares)
So the bacteria are just like robbers in real life? Noice 😙👌
Plot: twist he did this video while he was moving
My white cell count is 2X my red cell count 😅
"I dont feel like it" -me everyday
When your T cells are too lazy to work:
Lazy cell lol
Fun fact: when you have a weak immune sistem it's just cause your white blood cell is too lazy
“What are you talking abo-“ “SCATTER@
Are you a docter
*"Honey, the neighbors are doing the weird things again!*
my immune system when I get a cold because I don’t go outside and the one time I do I catch a cold: “yeah we’re just gonna make this cold about... 6 days long?”
What got me the mose was that *GET OUT THE WAY DIS MINE*
Honestly this is the funniest guy I've seen
*Laughs in this is the reason i have had chicken pox 4 times*
Lucas: "Whats this? I DONT CARE ITS MINE NOW SEEY BISH
I like it how bacteria is massive  Cuz you see the outside world
I love this music thats in every vid can we talk about that music
What happens if u uhh cry or laugh
YES YOU GOT LUCAS!!!
Do: what happens when you drink medicine
Who needs biology class when I have this
It is ironic how his short says "just do it"
The bacteria look like the cowboy cucumbers from vegetales, “Allow us to introduce ourselves”
His shirt: *JUST DO IT*
Very tired man
I love how Lucas is in the video
Lazy white blood cells
Lol his shirt
Me: why the doctor keeps laughing Doctor: i eatch this kind of memes hahahahahah
i think im finally able to learn i can watch the magic school bus lunch episode 10
When there in a body and the things in it has a body
“What’s this? IDC ITS MINE NOW”        Never open boxes from someone else…IT ALWAYS LEADS TO SUPERNATURAL OCCURRENCES
Everyone: talking about the T cell Me: how did he carry that sofa alone
Do one on a strong immune system
Lucas!!!! are You doing good man?
Bro my immune system is like one punch man saitama
Can u do what would happen to our body if it died
You white cell move move  yo you to slow stop slacking off 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Man keep up 😂
“Scatter!” Ring any bells?
My step sister has a weak immune system

I like how energetic that one guy is
Do something!  proceeds to do nothing himself
I got upset with this
It's like he is in a perpetual Monday.

My immune system is wayyyy too good-
I love the fact that this teaches while also being hilarious.
GeRm GaNg
Good thing I have a strong immune system, haven't been sick in months👍
I love how white blood cell’s shirt says just do it lmaoooooo
I loved the long haired guy running out of the house, it made chuckle
HARDSTOPLUCAS: WHATS This ITS MINE NOW
The lazy cell was then fired, never to be seen again.
do when you have a realy strong imunsystem
Answer me this what happens when T cells get infected like they get an infection
What happens when blood rushes to your head
Love the fact that the weak immune system is wearing a “just do it” Nike shirt
I just like how the bacteria in the back keep switching places with each other.
It should be called lazy immune system instead of weak
DAMN LUCAS CAN RUN
Lucus 😂
Thanks god that's not me, Ill have a cold and it will be gone the next day 😂😂
My body irl
Me: currently in the hospital with sepsis the past week. I felt this one 🤦🏼‍♀️
No wonder t cells are the last responders
Maybe I am a weak immune system
The perfect way to move out
His shirt s a y s  otherwise
Reminds me of younger Cory
Omg this is me today :(. Viral infection after weeks of work stress and overworking snd lack of sleep and eating properly
My immune system is very guilty of this behavior 😅 but it's also been hacked due to my autoimmune diseases. They like to overrun the system and hack my brain and nerves alarm system. It's like a 3 year old who likes to call 911 for no reason other than just because they learned how to use the phone.
hello skedadudlers
Me having a bad immune system tho
I love how Hard Stop Lucas is in this video, he’s so funny
I like how no matter where Lucas is he's always the guy who steals shit
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=02vx2usBzpE
Lmaoo This is the funniest one
Keep up the work. It’s very intelligent what you produce and very creative as well
Lol Bacteria litterly seems like big smoke and his gang
Scatter! 😂
Me sitting in my room then my brother comes in thwn all my stuff is gone.
My cells do a good job at fighting diseases since I haven't been sick in 2 years xd
Is  ✨t h i s✨ the reason I get sick all the time
He's Shirt Say Just Do It 🤣
I love the fact that the white blood cells are wearing a shirt that says " *JUST DO IT* "
Pov : You borrowed your friends house for a shorts Idk
So true
I like how the white blood cell is wearing a shirt that has the "just do it" on it.
And this is why you need to be unhygienic sometimes
They should do one for if it’s a strong immune system
T cells: “I don’t really feel like it”
I like how they busted in like that
My immune system is as sad as i am, it doesn't like to get out of bed :,V
Alt title: if you didn’t eat enough dirt as a child
And a just do it shirt to boot!
These videos are the only thing that has redeemed tiktok even a little in my eyes. These videos are gold, seriously.
My immune system so weak, my T-cell always call in sick.
All three: ooooooooo mine now
Man I love Lucas sm😂😂
*runs away in weak immune system but stops running bc damn*
It's more like a lazy immune system than weak though
No one wondering why is that 2 bacteria in the back actually change position?
Why does this remind me of angry birds
Mane said take action
My strong immune system: *Ray Rice Activated*
I love how the two people in the back switch places twice XD
This guys too funny
“Move out the way!” *also the door having no one in its way*
Whats your spirit animal? *T-cell*
Okay this one I am feeling personally attached 😆😆
So all this time my immune system was just lazy... that explains somethings I guess
To everyone! You are beautiful just the way you look! You are important! You do have worth and meaning! I love you! You are important!  You do not need to be skinny or have abs to be Beautiful! You are beautiful just the way you look! Never forget that! Always be loving and kind to everyone! Jesus loves you!  Never forget that you are so beautiful and you do have meaning and worth! Everyone is beautiful!
Alt title: the inside of an antivax
Cells at Work: western edition
Wait, I HAVE A WHOLE SOFA INSIDE OF ME??!?! Cool
Lucas is so funny   Lucas: I’m not playing these games  Me 😶😂🤣
I have a weak immyne system :(
Me who used to watch the videos he did when he duplicated himself: wow he has friends good times man
His cells really b having depression lmao
Is it just me or did he let that white blood cell wear that shirt on purpose-
Me with a strong immune system: *slams door*
My T-cells are strong as hell
The way lucas left tho-😂
lol difference between a weak immune system and a lazy one tho
And if you have a strong immune system as soon as the bacteria is inside the body the white blood cells are there to beat the life out of the bacteria
Like how this guy has friends who do this, it’s cool
Germ gang! Lol
Man, I think this is just a video he made while moving or something
I love how it's wearing a shirt saying Just Do It
I AINT PLAYIN YO GAMES
Take your vitamins kids   always do.
“What’s this? I don’t even care it’s mine now!” Me playing Skyrim in a nutshell
Heh, i eat bacteria on a dayly basis, so I’m producing a lot of T cells each day
I have a weak immune system Accurate
I have the most best immune system  So when like 80 bacteria comes in.  **megolavaina starts to play**
So if bacteria was in a humanoid form, it would steal pretty much everything(just saying)? So should we start calling thieves BACterias, cause this are bugging us?
This must be what’s going on with me 😔
No its just a teenage White Blood Cell🤣
This is so my bodie😂😂😂😂😂😂lmao
Yup this is real this is me I just want god to give me a refund on my broken body
Me: what about strong immune system?? I have a very strong one All my friends: GOD DANG IN SICK AGAIN THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME THIS WEEK Rest of the weak immune system world: can we trade immune system??
Bruh t-cells
Hook me up with dreads
“What are you talking abou-“ Germs: “Scatter!”
I learnt more science on this guys channel than I did in college 🤣🤣
Thank you for clearly defining what is happening in my shitty body ☺️
How I feel after school
By far, my fave one😂😂
Damn I forgot Lucas was still around, really miss his yt😂
“haha he’s not making any calls >:)”
I'm unhealthy AF But i got a strong immune system at least
No one: The neighbors across the street:
Cells at work in manga: Cool Cells at work in anime: Cool Cells at work netflix adoption:
Plot twist: they’re moving houses and they just fell into character.
My body lol
You always do great work and your sets may be low budget but you make it work great. Love the old school phone too.
Is that hard stop Lucas!!!!!
This is my life.
I literally have a weak immune system I sneeze like five times in 2 minutes
Me brothers when I make myself something to eat: "What's this? I DON'T CARE IT'S MINE NOW!"
Me watching this with the flu 😯
SCATTER 😂
Do: what really happens when you have Demintia
Man what cells are lazy lean man white cells a lazy they can't even do anything do you want to be lazy all day until they just leave and then when he does infect it
I'd love to see the Autoimmune disorder version of this.
This is how I see my immune.
kids actually have better immune systems so we will somewhat unlikely get corona but it depends if kids are around some people
That’s fricking hard stop Lucus-
Is this guy's favorite anime cells at work I bet it is 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 lmao
I like how T cells was also where “just do it”
IS THAT HARD STOP LUCAS
Unless you got hashimotos disease then they all at the thyroid trying to destroy it instead of fighting infection
This guy has the coolest videos that I watch daily
“When you have aids”
They ain’t Playing No Games !!!    Coming Sooon 😎
Lucas' jump tho
When you die of infections this is why and no I'm sorry if that a fended any one
I learned the human body from this guy lol
Is that dtay
I’ve been seeing a lot of this guy lately and he’s really funny.
Yoo 420 subs
Man my white blood cells are fricken super saiyans
Lucas sound like lil John
My boy got a full crew now. Nice... Plus that body going to straight up die.
They swapped places in the beginning I was confused at first
E
SCATTER
3 of my favorite people
Coming from someone with a handful of autoimmune disorders, this sounds about right 😂🤣😂
Omg lucas!!
That literally is my stomach
I just realised me getting sick is the equivalent of a home invasion
Immunosuppressants: tranquilizing the sh*t outta those T cells
I'm sick right now and I think this is what is happening to me in my body right now lol 🤣
LUCAS!!!!
😂😂🤣
Now I wanna see the opposite of it...what happens if you have a really strong immune system?
Just like my little cousins when they come over my place entering my room grabbing my stuff and running around the house😒
This feels like a live action of Cells at Work 😂
Yo this man watched cells at work to many times
I have leraned more from this channel in a month than my intire school carier
**JOINK**
It’s funnier when it’s just him tbh no offence to the homies
Not to flex but my immune system has bodyguards😏
( Me having intense pain and eyes blackout )    Bacteria is that you?
I know for a fact that is how they are
I just realised the bacteria taking the phone to stop then from talking to the brain could be a way of showing paralysis
Ha
Is this suppose to be your immune system or a reenactment of the crazies in portland and other cities breaking into places and looting?
It would've have been more funny if Lucas said "IM NOT PLAYING THESE GAMES!!" 😂😂😂
Bro you funny as hell 🤣 #Respect
What do ur neighbours think of u when u do these and they can see u
👁👄👁 SCATTER 👁👄👁
IS THAT HARDSTOP LUCAS I SEE🤪🤪🤪
Lucas what this must be why his channel is not active
I can relate     Alot
Can we just appreciate the way Lucas is eying the place and looking around like in his old skits when they stand in the door frame? 😂 this trio is doing some good comedy
i see lucas
This is why he got mad in the future because of white blood cells
That was hilarious
So this is what my body is like
Is this content of someone moving

All I saw was Lucas in the back
Woah hardstop lucas needs to chill
Is that hard stop Lucas 😱 I love his vids I’m not playing these games

T cells is short for THC

Kurzgesagt has been quite since this channel appeared...
Omg I think one of those guys is hardstoplucus

"Well, You shouldn't have released all that hormones, brain cells" "But it's a female, of course we need to reproduce" "Ever heard of Terminal AIDS ?" "What the hell is AIDS ?" "It's a serious condition"

Omg that's hardstoplucas
iM NOT PLAIN THESE GAMES
Make a video for iron deficiency people like how everything becomes black if we suddenly get up from laying in bed.
Fun fact: There’s an actual anime called The Cells At Work
I have a small theory.               So when they grab the phone, which the cells and stuff usually use for calling other groups of the body, does that mean that they can’t transmit signals?  Also, they took a scooter, so does that mean that the person can’t move?
Literally me
Why is T cells me when ever I have to wake up 😂
I'm not here to offense, can you maybe make "what happen to our body, when the T cell attack our own cell?, (I forgot the medical name). I think there is a condition about that
Why is Lucas here
Another Season of Cells At Work?
Loud mouth? Is waaaaaa-??????
I don't get sick to often so I feel like the bacteria get in there just to see a ssj3 transformation
If you guys like this type body comedy try watching cells at work its on netflix its an anime
Why does this educate me more than school ever did?
This explains your cells better than in a nutshell
Funny but too much screen shake

“What’s this? I DON’T CARE ITS MINE NOW

Yes hardstop lucas is in a vid
Fun fact: When the immune system has defeated the intruder the immune system commit suicide to save resources. So the immune cells take their own life.

Thank you so much for your relatable and hilarious tictocs.  I have a Compromised Immune system with T-killer cells. I sent this to my kids and family. Nobody gets why I am so sick and hospitalized so often. This was perfect.

Seeing Lucas participating in your videos is wonderful.
Repost
I’m sorry, amazing video but I just got severe nostalgia from seeing my dude Hard Stop Lucas is the video.
Do a, "what really happens when you get a splinter." i'd think it would be really cool if so, even though, you probably don't take suggestion's.
I was studying for my test tomorrow but clearly this is more important
0:09 it's hard stop lucas on the right
Ain't gonna lie. At first I thought they were just a lil cheesy but the more n more I watch, the more I love them 😭 keep up the good work, brother, you earned yourself a sub and I know there's many more to come!
Yo Hardstop!
Cells at Work but irl
The 3rd one is hardstoplucus
Yes, week is the correct way to spell it
weak not week ..
If you haven’t already, please do some about muscle cramps, working out, being hella sore, and maybe flexing?

Loud mouth
Aye hard stop Lucas

Ah yes, there are 7 days in an immune system
You should do what really happens when you get pregnant that would be funny
I have weak immune system.  But I guess now, I started to get better. If I was back to when I was born I'd get sick everytime, until I was in 9th grade. Like, I'd always have an absent record every month or week at school.
This series is better than the anime version xd
A week immune system? What's that?
The Couch 🛋 Killed me Tho
WOW!! THAT IS RELATABLE!!!
Me: **reads title** Me: “Wait, does it mean your immune system only lasts a week?”
Only an hour ago lol
