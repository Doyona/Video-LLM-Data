“i came in with a boogie and pnb” where  is pnb
“The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.” ‭‭2 Peter‬ ‭3:9‬ ‭NIV‬  Matthew 11:28-30  “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”  ROMANS 10:9-11 “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame”   “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”” ‭‭Luke‬ ‭19:10‬ ‭  God wants us to believe in His One and Only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, who died for our sins :D When we truly believe in our hearts that Jesus is the Son of God, who died for our sins so we could have eternal life with God, we are saved, and have life in Jesus Christ ❤  Jesus genuinely loves you, and always waits for you to come to Him 💗

Kodaks verse on drowning might’ve been goofy but he snapped on this shit💯
Ride my wave
boogie whack, ruined the whole song.
what note is singing for autotune???
Part 3, Boogie gets resuscitated and says he "saw the light". Becomes a born-again Christian, preaches the word of God, then gets caught fucking his 17 year old mistress.  Part 4, Boogie goes to jail.
This song is too damn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥶🥶🥶🥶
