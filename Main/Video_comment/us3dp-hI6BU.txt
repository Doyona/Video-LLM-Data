R.I.P. Sean Connery (1930-2020) he will be truly missed. 🙏🏼😭💐
also he was literally a DRAGON  how do you recap his acting career and not even bring up Dragonheart
The most hypocritical Scottish man ever 😂😂😂earned millions and preached from abroad 😂😂😂😂paid NOTHING to Scotland for decades 😂😂😂but don’t worry he was a good actor 😂😂😂😂
I thought he'd be older than 90. I'm not a fan of the Bond franchise but he was the best Bond no one else comes close. He was born to play that role.
Great 👍  marvelous  charismatic  🎬  actor  he got  naturalistic  behaviour. Charming  actions. Bless with the  nature
I was glad to see a quick shot from “Never Say Never Again,” one of Connery’s best Bonds (along with “From Russia With Love”). When he’s at that dockside bar in the Bahamas, Fatima Blush deliberately crashes into him. She says, “How reckless of me, I’ve made you all wet!” Bond replies, “Yes, but my martini is still dry.”
Sean Conery always got mad at the fact he was remembered most for playing James Bond he would say whenever someone asked him how it felt to to play Bond why they ask that and not how it felt to play someone like King Auther.
Godspeed Sean.
You snuck in
At least three or four
That one and 62 that look like them
Good bye Mr bond my mum Eileen Johnson favourite bond she was great I had her ashes interred in red house cemetery woodlands today she with my dad Peter at red house cemetery God bless you all
Legendary Actor and always best Bond, James Bond. 🍸🍸7
I will forever shed a tear. One of my all time favorite human beings
90! He lived a good long life.
The best actor as James Bond handome. One of my favorite rest in love Sean💖
OMG... and a disarming sense of humor. (No wonder the ladies loved Sir Connery aside from a twisted steel handsomeness )
My hero!🤵
Untouchables, Indiana Jones and Hunt for red October. He was also the best James Bond.
Rip
In Loving Memory Of Sean Connery (1930-2020)
I did love him in the Untouchables, and won best supporting actor. He deserved more awards.
Didn't he die in 2012?

An icon of all times! Beyond James Bond movies I remember him also for his great roles in "The Name of the Rose"; "The Untoucheboules" and "Finding Forrester".
I have sean video game for my xbox and i have complete it many times but i used to die one of the missions because it was so hard
⚡🌩️⚡!!! RAMIREZ !!!⚡🌩️⚡
The first movie I remember watching with him in it as a kid was Highlander. Sean Connery will be missed, and remembered.
Rip to the greatest James Bond actor ever and all around legend
A legend among legends.  A man's man.  Best James Bond ever
Damn man R.I.P. Capt. John Patrick Mason🙏🏾
Just a couple of nights ago I found out he died rest in peace
Today we sail into history my favorite movie of his the Hunt for Red October...R.I.P Mr. Sean Connery
F
My boyfriend broke up with me exactly the time he died!🤔
When someone loves you, the way they talk about you is different. You feel safe and comfortable.
What a life he lead... from a milkman to a knight... and of course the Bond in-between. RIP Sir Sean Bond Connery...❤️
Rest easy Sean
Dear Mister Connery, I'm going to miss you and your interesting films.
BEST BOND EVER!!! There will NEVER be a BOND of Sean's calibre. Prime Creator bless him and his family.. ❤️
RIP
Sean Connery, the measuring stick as to which each James Bond is measured. There will never be another like him. The man lived life to the fullest, and bore his heart on his sleeve. Sean, you will be truly missed, and we will see you again soon! Rest In Peace!
James bond you were my role model....
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that 2020 is just a warm-up round for the main event, 2021.
Connery is my favorite 007 by far. ❤️🙏🏼 #RIP
This actor is one of a kind such an amazing actor.  RIP Sean Connery... You will always be remembered.
We'll miss him. What an icon!
Sean Connery’s last words before dying?  “Suck it, Trebek.”
I knew him as Henry Jones sr. Rip😔
Condolences & prayers... "O Lord, glorify his station, shelter him under the pavilion of Thy supreme mercy, cause him to enter Thy glorious paradise, and perpetuate his existence in Thine exalted rose garden, that he may plunge into the sea of light in the world of mysteries." ~ Baha'i Prayer
Asli keceh saat mudax
Another legend that we lost...
Ironic that for a Scottish nationalist he became a BRITISH cultural icon, though he wouldn't like me saying that
And Bond Girls Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg also passed away this year
God Bless you Sean Connery. Thank you for your entertainment. You were a good look'in man, I loved your accent. I'm going to miss ya in your sexy kilt too, lol! I pray for your soul and for your family's loss. 🙏❤😊
R. I. P Sean Connery ❗😢🙏
Just when you thought 2020 couldn't get any worse😔
The biggest sin sean did in life was sir billi
I remember Sir Sean Connery as Indiana Jones' father, Dr. Henry Jones, in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" alongside Harrison Ford. RIP Sean Connery 1930-2020
He died on Halloween.  Anyway he lived on this earth in the best times.  2020 sucks.
Always been my favourite Bond.
God I hate getting old
RIP
Quel Charme ! Quel Charisme ! Quelle Allure ! Quelle Élégance ! Quel Talent ! Jamais prétentieux ! Quelle Aura ! Tellement Magnifique en Kilt écossais et si Digne et Humble agenouillé devant la Reine d'Angleterre ! Son adorable sourire et son oeil pétillant de malice ... Je suis heureuse de savoir qu'il s' est éteint pendant son sommeil (sans souffrir et sans s' en rendre compte), comme une bougie qui après avoir rayonné a terminé son cycle ... "Bons baisers" Sir Connery et bon voyage ; les Anges vous escortent vers l'Éternité ...
son of scotland, emperor of bond character,: a real Legend
My Parents loved this actor, I love him too and I still can not believe he passed away Rest in Peace, Always remember you.
Very SAD

:(
RIP , my idol, my role model , my father figure..... I will miss you a great deal Sean !  .. You cheated death so many times on screen as a protagonist swashbuckler.. but I guess to do the same off screen ain’t as easy as it seems .. Sweet dreams Mr Bond , I will meet you again , but not yet .. not  yet ... 😕😢
Well damn.we lost a legend
Oh my its dead.
Prince charming forever has gone
BOND BEAUTIFUL "BEAST" 😍🙏🕯️
"...Here endeth the lesson."
Best James bond ever truly one of the greatest he was sex on legs RIP Sean connery xx
RIP Sean  BEST BOND EVER... he set the standard...
RIP Sean  BEST BOND EVER... he set the standard...
He was the best actor in my books. I hate to hear that he has left us.
He couldn't handle all the leftist crap anymore...
How the freak did I miss this!?!??
I will always endearingly remember him as the voice of Draco in Dragonheart.. or Draco altogether. May he rest in peace.
He shouldn't have slept instead he should have slept with lots of young ladies to increase his lifespan by a few days! >.<
How could the Hollywood walk of Fame forget Sean connery!
RIP!!
If James Bond were a real person he would want to be Sir Sean Connery.
I just got the news I am so depressed right now. He was the best bond and my favorite as well rest in peace
He was one of earliest crushes when I was 12!  I never saw a more handsome man before!  But he was a terrific actor!  RIP Sean!
Rest In Peace, you legend
Geez I didn't even know he died.  The newspaper didn't announce it and it never appeared in my Google news or anything!
A legend leaves us, a short video to pay tribute to him. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap0Jlzz4geE
A truly wonderful actor has been lost, so sad.
Good man great Actor 👍
😪😪😪🙏🏼🙏🏼
If he favored Scottish independence, that questions his loyalty to Great Britain and the U.K., not to mention England.  The leads one to wonder whether he might actually have been a double agent.
Rest in Paradise you will always be the Supreme James Bond!!
Good bye Sean. You had a good run! You'll live forever as  007!
Jeff Glor looks better w/o the tie.
pure legend......    I love Dan Craig, especially in "Casino Royale", but lets face it, Sean Connery will always be the greatest "Double O Seven"    R.I.P.
We are lesser for his passage. God bless him and his family. Truly one of the greatest.
I love , loved , this man. . I will surely miss him. May you Rest In Peace, Sean. 🙏🙏🙏👌❤️🎈👍
What does it take  to make  the coolest guy ever? A DNA cross between Clint Eastwood, Elvis Presley, and Anthony Hopkins,  or just Sean Connery.  I always felt like he was just playing himself, if he was the character.  In my opinion if you don't carry yourself as this man did, you're not at 100% of your potential.  So yah" I REALLY liked this guy, if we lose Clint Eastwood as well I'm not sure the leaves are going to come back out on the trees next spring?  There's no one left but Hustlers losers Liars fakes con men cry babies conspiracy theorist Donald, NO REALLY Donald Trump!  was elected president🤢
The fact that he was a Scot..borne out of poverty and an unprivileged life...a true diamond in the rock ..Thank you God.
James Bond might be down but 007 will always return. Sean Connery will always be with us.
RIP, Sir.
Loved me some Sean.  Rest Gracefully.
Saying Goodbye to a Legend RIH Sean Connery!!! The only 007 I loved!!!
I will Be binge watching the Untouchables tonight I’ll cry when he gets killed in the shoot out scene But this time for real Major crush
He didn't have a smooth girly face like that country bumpkin moore!!
Good obituary but didn't mention his Hitchcock film 'Marnie'
The real James bond
Your legacy never dies, Mr. Bond 💗💗💗💗💗💗
He was a great actor. RIP Sir Connery. https://youtu.be/U5-RJKrt5Jk
Great people that are actors are leaving us-- what we have now are wishy washy- portrayors and pretenders
Sean Connery was James Bond--everyone else played James Bond
😢
Rest in peace 007.
May you rest in peace, James Bond or Sean Connery, the.multi awarded holiwood actor and my heartfelt condolences to his family.
Rest in peace Mr Bond.....
I'm just now realizing this 😟😦 two day's later rip 🙏 Sean connery
The legendary bond star of all time  Rest in peace Sir Sean Connery 1930-2020
Every living politician could die tomorrow, and I still wouldn't care nearly as much as I do about Sir Connery. The man who became a Knight by acting the King.
In my mind.. such a great artist is living always..I always respect..
He always played real spies https://freenews.today/2020/11/02/clothes-make-the-spy/
one word "class"
May he rest in peace,
Thank you
The best James Bond.  RIP
Love all this movie super cool dude
When he was filming "You Only Live Twice" he was awarded a 3rf degree black belt from the founder of Kyokushin karate, Mas Oyama.  I tried being like him, at least ,a gun a badge. Nah- I ended up a IRS agent.  The only thing I fought was management and paperwork and more paperwork.   But in other of Sean's movies from Darby O'gill to Forrester, he was a master of his craft.
The news reader has the worst wig 👨
RIP Sean, you will be missed!
RIP Sean Connery. Bond James Bond. You stood up for Scottish independence. You make me proud to be Scotttish x
Thank you for all the wonderful memories Sean rest easy ❤
Since his passing I've been binge watching his Bond films to pay tribute to the man. It's great that his films remain and in them he remains timeless, always Bond always at the ready to do what he needs to do for Queen and Country. R.I.P Mr. Bond, Mr. Connery, we'll always remember you, thanks for all the great roles you left us.
Remember when People Magazine chose him as Sexiest Man Alive. Boy I do!  And was he ever.
the ending scene of "the rock" is how I like to rmr him... watching it back now made me tear up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tk-VK4ZRmjs
R.I.P. BOND JAMES BOND.
😢😢😢😭😭
Sean Connery you will be missed by many thank you for everything you did the I loved to watch your movie called Rock you will be forever remembered as Bond James Bond rest in peace my friend oh I can't forget Indiana Jones
Sad about Sean... BUT -  DID YOU SEE THOSE BRIGHT BEAMS OF SUNSHINE THAT BROKE THRU CLOUDS TODAY AND FELL OVER TRUMP? TWIITER HAS PICS!! 😳
RIP
You will be deeply missed R.I.P one of my favorite.
If James Bond were a real person he would want to be Sir Sean Connery.
Well at least he lived to see his 90th birthday in August of 2020 .
भगवान! 💐Sean Connery💐 की आत्मा को शांति दे! 🙏🙏🙏 😔😔😔
He had a great voice and personality. He’ll be missed, he was an Awesome character in the Highlander movies as well.
Well now are lives are meaningless.
I think Sean Connery is the best among the best James bond
This is one of the most beautiful persons'  that I've never had the opportunity to meet. He was the most distinguished gentleman on screen. Wish I had known you. My greatest condolences to his loved ones. I've been to Edinburgh twice, most recent last Christmas. Will definitely think of him next time I visit.
We will surely miss you! RIP Sean Connery! You were one of my favorite Actors!
Oh how sad
What a full life. Rest In Peace. Sean.
My favorite Bond actor also great in Hylander RIP
RIP my Scottish brother . Will meet you in heaven !
RIP JAMES BOND
You know that you lived a long time when your once underage girlfriend says nice things about you. And she's now 76 years old!
We'll dude was 90 year old !! what do you expect ?? 😲He had a good life with no worries in the world 😝
Sean Connery WAS NOT the first actor to play the role of James Bond. That goes to George Lazenby who was the first to play that part(he is still living,81 years old) although he played the role only once&then Sean Connery took over the role.
RIP 007 . Thanks for the ride .
😿😿😿
Rest In Peace so awesome love he’s movies never forget him thank you for your beautiful movies
You were the best Bond ever. RIP my friend.
He was my favorite 007 🥰
No other Bond was as charming, witty, and deadly. More than Bond, he was a great actor! His role in the untouchables was a masterpiece! So saddened by the news.
He was the original James Bond actor. No one can replace him. So sad he passes away. He will forever be the bond actor everyone loves. RIP Sean. May the angels 👼 guide you
I wish he was William Wallace in braveheart
RIP Sean Connery  the best James Bond ever. All of his movies were Grade A.
Sean Connery, RIP. T_T
Rip 🙏 🥀🕊 I know he lived a long life but I was sad to hear that when I had found out about it !  He was one of my favorite actors growing up he was in a bunch of timeless & classic movies i grew up on!  One of my all time favorites with him is the rock  With Nicholas cage   Obviously we all love him as the 007 James bond character  Im sad he's gone but glad he left us so many good movies with his presence rip  Sean connery
Mr bond James Bond 0️⃣0️⃣7️⃣  I want a martini shaken not stirred 🍸  Just to honor him before he even passed I changed the name of my phone account to James bond and now I will never change it again 🙏 🕊
007, God Bless
Read yesterday that Connery’s proudest screen performance was his 1965 ‘the hill’. Apparently he watched it a few times whilst a friend stayed with him last year, the friend said that apparently almost every scene Connery would say something like ‘oh this is the best, right?’   I also love how the women thirst over him at the end. Just passed away at 90 years of age, his prime years practically half a century ago and the ladies still want him! 🤣🤣😩
Nabad ku waar
RIP Mr. James Bond Connery you are out favorite Bond, you are now in Heaven with God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, your memories will live on, thanks Mr. Bond✝️🌹🙏❤️
May he Rest In Peace. And condolences to his family Best one that played James Bond 😃
Very nice man I always saw walking here in the bahamas

Sean Connery  was and is the MAN, HE BROUGHT  JOY  AND A VAST AMOUNT OF ENJOYMENT  TO THIS WORLD, IT IS A RARE  OCCASION  INDEED WHEN THE OUTER PERSONNA  MATCHES  THE INNER ONE, WHICH WAS GREATER,  TEARS  ARE FALLING DOWN MY EYES.  HE WAS 007 NOW AND FOREVER  MORE REST IN PEACE Sean Samir

Sean's death is totally unfortunate. It's too bad he couldn't live at least 10 years longer.
pog
rest in peace Sean Connery
R.I.P. Ramirez from "Highlander" (1986).

R.I.P. Commander!
WHAT A GREAT MAN, THE SUCCESS, THE COOLNESS,  THE WORLD WAS A BETTER PLACE WITH SEAN IN IT, WEATHER IT WAS BOND OR WHATEVER HE WANTED TO DO, I GREW UP WITH HIS PRESENCE , HE IS LIKE A FAMOUS UNCLE, AN WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN 🌹🌹
The only BOND !!!!!!!
Another professional Hollywood BS artist. We all need someone to idolize, worship and call our hero. 😉
Shakin' but not stirred.  Farewell Bond, James Bond.
What an undeniable presence he possessed! His unmistakable voice and cadence— his raised eyebrows glare when he delivered a line. Yes— he is the BEST BOND EVER— no one can be compared— and his estate should be retroactively compensated for cementing the enduro success of the long running franchise. Every time I watch “THE ROCK” — I just wait with excited anticipation for him to say the words after he tumble rolls under the fiery crisscrossing blades in the giant fan— and unlocks the underground vault door: “...Welcome to the Rock...” R.I.P. Sean Connery. 🙏🏿✊🏾
RIP, the first agent 007
I hope he found Jesus before last breath.Otherwise all success will be in vain. My condolences to he's family.
RIP Sir Sean Connery, my first big movie idol. A man of class and the best Bond ever. First saw him in Goldfinger which I got on VHS, was intrigued by that gold draped woman and Sean in his tux. However my fave Bond flick is From Russia with Love. He was also in other favorites like The Rock, The Hunt For Red October, Indy & the Last Crusade, Untouchables, Highlander.  Fois dhut. Taing airson a h-uile càil.
May you reast in pace mr Bond you are the best thing ever in the best of james bond movies you have the best bond movies for 7  times and you are the best bond ever and I am your biggest fan of all time and you will be  awesome my dear friend from Gabrielle Rivas and we will miss you mr Bond james bond Mr 007
Sir Sean Connery RIP. THE one and only James Bond.  We'll never forget his statement: "The only banks  I trust are the ones I own."
There goes another one. It seems we are losing all of our good actors and have been doing it for years
The Legend the first james bond. R.i.p Mr. Bond he is a better place with god st. Peter and Paul forgot which one have the key open the heaven gate.
Rest in Peace Sean Connery.  To me, you were the ONLY Bond, James Bond.
RIP the Great Sean Connery. Sad and devastating news.
Great movies for a Sean Connery 🦋🌙
He got better with age.Araund his 70 he looked hotter more than he was younger.
Was my passion as a teen. Will always my favorite James Bond even today. Rest happy wherever your spirit has gone.
i saw this live saturday morning oct 31 2020
Isaiah 53:5, But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are healed. For salvation, people just need to follow the way they did it in Acts? They were baptized in the water and of the spirit. Here's why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled with the Holy Ghost and rising again from the dead. That's what Acts 2:38 is. We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD. We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed. One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritan. Our salvation has to match-up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away. Eternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church. It's better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction. Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, They continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. Jesus Christ was our perfect example back to God. He was baptized and received the Holy Ghost and we must be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost. He was holy and walked in righteousness and we must be holy and walk in righteousness. He died and rose again, and we must die to the things of this world and rise to walk in the newness of life. He prayed to the father showing us how to pray to the father. If you believe in this message, help spread it in the name of Jesus Christ. God bless you
Haven't you ever lost your car keys?  "RIP SEAN CONNERY"
So young, so young. One of my favorites!
"The Hill", "The Offence" - best performances.   RIP Sean.
I wish all the Bonds were onstage when Adele sang Skyfall for that particular Oscars broadcast.
I'm crying my eyes open sean connery you will be missed will gladly trade Donald trump fair trade
*SEAN CONNERY = JAMES BOND.* *¡¡¡EL MEJOR AGENTE SECRETO DEL IMPERIO BRITÁNICO!!!* *¡¡¡QUÉ EN PAZ DESCANSE!!!*
GREAT ACTOR REST IN PEACE NEVER BE FORGOTTEN.
Oh I’m so saddened, he was my all time favorite actor. RIP
Dude I just watched "The rock" yesterday... this planet sucks.
I did not think 2020 could get any worse. But it did. We will always miss you Sir Sean Connery. We love you. Rest in Peace.
RIP Sean your one of a kind.
You would think icons and bigger than life people like him would automatically live to be at least 120. To me "Thunderball" wasn't THAT long ago that I saw it at the theaters.
R I P
such a shame....what a great actor.  RIP my man.
A mans man and the most realistic Bond of Ian Flemmings books converted to movies. Glad he lived latter part of his life in the Bahamas and went out like a G. RIP sire.
Go to this Gold Light ! Thanks for the memories.  You dun gud. Rest in Peace
Best Bond of all!  RIP. 😤
For me, you'll be always the Indiana's father, rest in peace sir
One of my favorite actors. R.I.P
I wish he had nothing to do with Wuhan virus. RIP our hero.
Bummer! I grew up with him as Bond. RIP Mr. Connery. Your charisma is unmatched
Dragon heart anyone?
A true man's man!  What a class act on and off stage! RIP🙏
You better do some research before you go gushing over someone. He was a misogynist Supreme. I’m tired of people normalizing bad behavior.
Personal hero
Rest Mr.Bond you've done your duty.
RIP  Sir Sean Connery. You will be missed, you will be remembered. Respect.
F
May you Rest In Peace 🙏🏻
Safe travels Captain Marcus Raimus of the submarine Red October!

Rest In Peace Sir
Thank you for entertaining the world , God bless.
Got to say a BIG thank you for all the entertainment you provided Sean Connery - May God bless you on your onward journey!
No mention of The Hill, A Fine Madness, The Wind and the Lion, Robin and Marian, The Great Train Robbery, The Name of the Rose, Dragonheart...These Connery retrospectives are too much Bond and too little Connery.
So it is true Cpt Marko Remius is gone. I'm so saddened and shock
Love him as Bond.  Rest in paradise Bond, James Bond 🙏 💔
💔💔😭
Too bad he retired after starring in several stinkers. Like The Avengers (1998). I mean a beenie baby bear costume? REALLY?!?!
RIP Mr. Connery, you will be missed
Highlander would not have been as good without Sean.  RIP Sir.  And thank you for the history that you made.
Loved him in the untouchables a great actor a great voice now silent, but will live on forever
Rest In Peace. You are inmortal Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez.
He lived a long life. He'll always be the best Bond! He was great in classics like Highlander, India Jones and the last crusade and the Rock. Best Scottish accent!
Rest in peace Mr Connery,he was my favorite bond James bond!

Both anchor women .. having a natural close to (prelude to ) an Orga....M”, I’m being scientific here .. ask them
This is tragic god bless his soul. I hate to say this, but CBS reported it, I had to research it to see if it was accurate. For everyone that doesn't believe the fake news, it is unfortunated but this news is accurate I have to tell you.
RIP 007. No one could do it better than you!
"Shocking............, positively shocking "   RIP
We have lost alot of the best actors comedians and people in 2020 but please remember they might have died but they shall never be forgotten
From Scotland with Love to the World. Bond movies, Indiana Jones, Red October, Untouchables, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and any other i forgot for which i remember him most. Thank you
All those films mentioned are good but still my favorite is time bandits directed by terry gilliam.  They never figured he would do the film they just wanted someone like sean...do he said no one is better at me then me...  A pleasant change and he did it well.  Goodbye jamas, goodbye sean.
Secret agent killed him called bond corona bond

When did he get old? When did everybody get so old. Jeez, I must be old too then!
The best Bond.
In Tarzan's Greatest Adventure, Connery played one of the bad guys.  Soon after the film was completed, Gordon Scott quit the role of Tarzan, and it was offered to Connery.  But Connery had to turn it down as he was already committed to making Dr. No.  Connery would have made an interesting Tarzan.  "Tarzan want martini.  Shaken, not stirred."
Sean Connery was the BEST 007!  Even SPECTRE thinks so...🐙
Definitely the most sexy James Bond
Your "best"! Losers always whine about their best. Winners go home and f**k the prom queen.
So an entertainer can become a knight?
R.I.P
The one and only James Bond.
Best actor the film industry has produced
Ein charismatischer Mann ? Der beste Jamea Bond aller Zeiten . Das ist sooo traurig 😔
OMG!!! FROWNZ WHITE 🌹❣️🌹 TEARZZ SAD ...LOSS OF A GREAT LIFE...
The ONLY James Bond!!  RIP.
Another silver screen icon gone. At least he lived a long prosperous life. RIP Mr. Connery.
RIP sir.
Another covid victim dam he could have lived another lifetime
He was a womanizer and a sexist goodbye dinosaur
loved him highlander 1
Our dear King Arthur, King Richard, Alexander the Great, Lord Macbeth, Robin Hood, Count Alexis Vronsky, William Von Baskerville, Professor Henry Jones, Jim Malone, Mark Rutland, Daniel Dravot, John Patrick Mason, Marko Ramius and James Bond  You taught us courage, wisdom and patience, you taught us to be righteous, generous and kind, never to give up on our believes, to fight our battles till the end, to face the problems without fear. With you we have learned all the values and virtues people don't see and don't have any more. You were the leader, teacher, father, brother, priest and lover ! You made generations of women fall desperately in love with you, made men admire and imitate you like naive boys... We shall never forget you dear Scottish boy ! Keep us safe from the villains from the skies above, we stil need you !
As a stern Bond fan, losing Connery and Moore in my lifetime stings so bad. Condolences to the families.
My Bond actor Rip.😢😭
R.I.P Sir Sean Connery
Rip Sir Sean Connery one of the best acting legends in the world and was one of my favorite Bond actors and been a fan for 25 years and only 33 years old now.
Connery had the best post-Bond career out of all the actors that played 007.
RIP Ramirez.  There can be only one.
Rest in peace 💔🙏
A great actor he be greatly missed my depressed love to his family and friends.
RIP
Simple tribute to Sir Sean Connery...https://youtu.be/HeoD3qRpfhE
Why would anyone vote for a man who openly supports the Communist Party of China? They have killed 100 million Chinese citizens from the end of ww2 till 1987 public fact! For not following party line Bloomberg was running for US President while he has 2000 Chinese working for him in China it's made him 60 billion dollars, public fact! now Bidens directly being influenced by his sons working for that Gov.? No conflict of interest? They are the Communist Party of China folks, Is America Mad?
James Bond actors "so far" seem to live a long life. Roger Moore 89. Sean Connery 90. I Mean, its always sad when people die. But if you had 90 years of the good life, you pretty much won at life. And dying in your sleep, isn't that the best way to go?.  R.I.P Sean Connery
Prayers request Lord Jesus Christ thy God in holy heavenly father is with his family.s amen you will be miss
Sad news, There will never be another actor like Sean Connery.
My absolute crush. Loved Sean all my life
Sad day for the film industry. Their will never be another James Bond like him. Nobody will come close to his ability at acting. Gone is the icon of every young boy inside us who knew him as James Bond. R I P Sir Sean Connery  😢😢😢 the son of Scotland.
Not until Daniel Craig has there been such a player to fit the role
Miss you Sean Connery
ADOPT ABUSED DOGS FROM CHINA NOW... MAKE ROSIE  YOUR GREATEST GIFT TO YOURSELF OR TO SOMEONE YOU LOVE FOR CHRISTMAS 2020...CONTACT NO DOGS LEFT BEHIND JEFFERY BERI..   https://youtu.be/1GKmS_hqCj0....

Best bond ever and forever
So long commander...
Respect all around. He did his thing.  Rest In Peace
Any body noticed the older he became the more handsome
R . I . P  Sir Sean Connery !
What was everyone’s favorite Sean Connery film? Mine was probably hung for red october
It's astounding in a horrifying way how many irreplaceable icons we've lost this year from all walks of life. Kobe Bryant, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Eddie Van Halen, Little Richard, Regis Philbin, Neil Peart, Kirk Douglas, and now Sean Connery. THE Elites of their professions who'll be remembered long after we're all gone. It's mind boggling losing that many once in a lifetime individuals in a single year.
Great Actor! Love His Accent & Deep Voice! Prayers For His Family & Friends!🙏❤️
Of course the best bond - a true legend.Tall dark and handsome- RIP Mr Bond. The best bond ever 🤗..
RIP sexist man voice and first James Bond.
RABBIE Burns I stay in the poets home town
The man died and she’s giggling ?
love the bbc i
First actor I've actually seen all movies... Sir Thomas Sean Connery...  https://youtu.be/YEIfjw4S_as  If you like and remember him in Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade...
Correction. Sir Sean Connery
R.I.P. Sean Connery
I’m surprised the media hasn’t tried to blame his death on Trump yet 🤷🏽
The original Bond? No, that was Fleming's written character.
Rest in Peace Sir Sean Connery aka The Best James Bond ever 😢🙏
As Mike Myers said '' women wanted to be with you, when men wanted to be you ''
What a full life he lived and gave us a beautiful treasure of movies to remember him, forever. ❤️
And long after all the tears are shed, Long after all the tears are dried,  You will live on words and song; You are our king of hearts.  RIP Sean Connery.
"The name's Bond....James Bond."  RIP Sir. Godspeed.
i have been a Bond fan since diamonds are forever. he will always be my favorite bond. lost another great actor  RIP Mr Connery
Om ami dewa hri
Repurposing Coconut oil as a vaccine is the best and safest vaccine against a virus.
Damn, I honestly never really favored him but it is sad to me. My grampa died at the same age. It’s crazy how somebody seems fine one day and then dies the next. I have no idea what he died of though or what he was going through. Last time I saw him on TV, he looked fine for almost 90. And it doesn’t seem that long ago that I saw him on his last movie. Time flies so fast.
He will always be my favourite actor
Most other actors strife to become their characters. Sean's method was to turn the character into _him,_ then he could be himself.
Thank you very much, Sir Sean Connery. You have left but the HUGE you remain...We grew up having you etched in our minds...
“The original Bond” as my family referred to him as. The irony is that I was just watching ERBs James Bond va Austin Powers video yesterday morning. My childhood is slowly dying.
How could 191 ppl down-vote a video commemorating Sean Connery???
He had a charm and charisma,unmatched..A great actor and talent and  the sexiest and most handsome man of them all.RIP Sir Thomas Sean Connery..the world will not be the same.
Rip legend
One of the easier ways to do a movie: stand by while Sean Connery does the heavy lifting and makes you look plausible. RIP Sir Sean Connery
A REAL ICON in the Movie Industry and A True Man of Honor, Dignity, Charm, TALENT and Integrity. Sean, You Will be sorely missed by MANY including me. Thank you For Your invaluable Contribution to Movie, Life and History!!! May God bless You eternally in Heaven. Enjoy and be at Peace and Rest with God Forever. Amen. SHALOM!!!
He has no time to die no Rips
Will be missed
all heaven property has to be accounted for
Rough month for icons first Eddie Van Halen and now Sir Sean Connery the best to play James Bond  ever, you will be sorely missed 007..
He's was the real James Bond!
I have always enjoyed watching him great actor and he aged well 90 years Wow well done
There can be only one highlander
There can be only one highlander
One PING
Wow ! I just found out about his passing🙁He will sorely be missed in life...a very charming good looking man and of a course a great great actor . Love you Sean  God Bless , You lived  a full life and gave us the best ❤️
Slipping into the pearly gates with "Bond. James Bond" and "We named the dog 'Indiana'." Rest in peace to the legend.
Best Bond ever!!
Super fantastic energetic stronger and more powerful actor of the world.
Sean Connery still alive in everybody's heart's and not died.
R.I.P. Mr. Bond. You will always be remembered. 💯
Cause of death...unprotected sex...syphilis
Thunderball ...as he leaves the health clinic...he tells the blonde health therapist..."another time...another place"...1958 movie with Lana Turner
Unprotected sex ...plus Blowfeld!
Condolences to his family & friends, he was the greatest James Bond actor and good gentleman. Farewell Sir Sean Connery.
RIP
"What a heartthrob!"  Yeah, especially when he is slapping you around, lady.
I had a feeling one day I would open up my browser and  it would say this legend had passed he was one if not my favorite actor of all time the best there ever will be RIP Bond
Can't ask for better than that. Life is so good. Make the best of it my friends 😎👍
He may be gone, but he'll never be forgotten.  RIP Mr. Connery.
RIP Mr. Bond Who's next on the 2020 death list
Hollywood celebrities are criminals. We don't bloody care!
Far more than just Bond, far more than just an incredible actor, he was a self made man who was an inspirational figure to many, a genuine humanitarian and a Scottish Patriot. I sincerely pray he is at peace.
YOU WILL ALWAYS B REMEMBER SEAN CONNERY .ERAS LO MAXIMO QUE DIOS LO TEMGA EN SU GLORIA  DESCANSA EN PAZ  ..MEXICO TE RECUERDA....
Rest in peace Sir Sean Connery❤😭
R.I.P. Sean Connery. All of your movies are a pleasure to watch.
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. .........................................................................................................................
Goodbye MR BOND,JAMES BOND RIP
Hearts broken
I was mesmerized with Ian Fleming’s novels, and would often read them in one setting. Going to work in the morning with no sleep. Sean Connery, playing the role of James Bond,  took me to a different world. A world of drama and intrigue. Thank you Sean. For me you will always be 007.
Bond,James Bond! Sean Connery, Earth is sending Love up! To all who Loved and lost him, your in our thoughts and prayers here in Philadelphia,Pa.
When I read about him passing, I was shaken, but not stirred.
Sean Connery is more than James Bond. He is a very versatile actor who personifies the very character in all the roles he portrayed.
Thank you for your service to the light Sir Sean Connery.
REST IN PEACE *Sean Connery* 1930 - 2020

When a favorite actor from your youth dies you suddenly feel old. It was fun watching you work, Mr. Connery. “Leave the Baretta, 007”.
Peter (at the Pearly Gates): "Name please" Sean Connery: "Connery, Sean Connery"
Wtf
Anyone else feel like they should retire James Bond completely knowing that Sean can never return?
And a sexy beast! Truly!
he was awesome as Indys dad
Sean connery and Roger Moore easily the best James Bonds. Sean connery was brilliant in Indiana Jones and the last crusade.  He was one of my heroes, I will continue to watch repeats of his brilliant films. Rip.
The only James bond great man
Damn dude...
RIP Sir Sean Connery💙🥺✌👋 Thanks for all the great movies 007, Henry Jones and The Untouchables and Finding Forester. Celebrate this man's life.  Put a candle in your window, lite up a smoke and have a Vodka Martini, shaken, not stirred.
My Top 5 (Non-Bond) Films Starring Sean Connery (that I still enjoy watching today):  Outland  Rising Sun  Russia House  The Hunt For Red October  The Man Who Would Be King
God bless him. He was one cool guy.
Tell me how he died.. I will tell you...how he lived.
Sean Connery apart from Bond he played so many awesome roles he was badass in Highlander, The Rock, Untouchables, Hunt for Red October, and ofcourse Indie i still think he was really good in Zardoz cause i like that he stepped outside of his comfort zone in that. Such a great Actor RIP our good friend.
Cultural Icon indeed.

My heart is broken to the news, Rest in Peace, 007.
R.I.P. Sir Sean Connery. I just remembered he voiced Draco in Dragonheart.
Several scenes from his Bond films were shot right here in The Bahamas -  where Sir Sean lived in a secluded neighbourhood for many years... I  met him during a press function. A lovely man. RIP James Bond 007.
As Sean Connery once said in the role of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Urquhart (in the classic "A Bridge Too Far"), "I thought everyone knew that God was a Scotsman."
Rest in peace mr bond , Dr. Jones Sr.
This is officially *THE WORST YEAR EVER* . God Fu**ing Damn.
He's sipping Martini up there with Desmond and Roger  shaken not stirred...  Rest in peace 007
HERE is the Original Semitic Text, oh how we’ve been deceived  YaH The Heavenly FATHER was Who they Crucified for our sins and “HERE IS THE PROOF”  From the Ancient Semitic Scroll:  "Yad He Vav He" is what Moses wrote, when Moses asked YaH His Name (Exodus 3)  Ancient Semitic Direct Translation Yad - "Behold The Hand" He - "Behold the Breath" Vav - "Behold The NAIL" <— YaH’s Crucifixion He - "Behold the Breath"  “Behold the HAND that Beholds The NAIL”   PROVES YAH THE HEAVENLY FATHER WAS WHO THEY CRUCIFIED   That is EXACTLY what Moses Wrote  Here is what they mean  YaH's Name: (Ya)d + (H)e, as YaH is what Moses called Him and YaH Declared: "this is My Name, this is My Name for all generations" (Exodus 3)  YaH is The Creator: Yad He, (HAND BREATH), as YaH's "Hand" Formed man from the dust  of the Earth and His "Breath" made him a living being (Adam)  YaH's Sacrifice of Crucifixion: Vav He (NAIL BREATH), the "Nail" through YaH’s "Hand", that whosoever shall call YaH Savior, His Breath brings forth life (Salvation)  How YaH arrives: YaH arrives via the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 33:7:11), where a Tent is erected outside the city, a cloud descends upon the entrance of the Tent and YaH appears...  Why they demanded YaH to be Crucified: YaH was Crucified according to Hebrew law (Deuteronomy 21), to be Hung on an Almond Tree for BLASPHEMY as it was for His NAME they demanded Him Crucified. The Messiah claimed He was YaH...  HE WAS YaH!!!  HalleluYAH “Praise ye YaH”  From The Hebrew Book of Isaiah, The Dead Sea Scrolls  Isaiah 42:8 "I am YaH; that is my Name! I will not yield my glory to another or my praise to idols.  Isaiah 43:11 I, I am YAH, and there is no other Savior but Me.  Isaiah 45:5 I am YaH, and there is none else.

good bye Sean Connery and rest in peace, and wish him good coming back with good karma life road
James Bond died with Sean's death  Roger Moore's and Daniel leaving the role turned off the life support for good.
Yet another reason that 2020 was the shittiest year ever. First Mrs Peel and now James Bond. Oh well, at least Ryan Phillipe still lives.
Deepest, Sympathy to family I am a bond fan for life those iconic suits, and smile rest in peace.
RIP. TO A LEGEND
After seeing The Untouchables, I thought he never gonna die. :(
growing up in the 60's all i ever wanted was my attache case with fake red bullets and my trenchcoat what an amazing actor  RIP MR SEAN
He picked the "right time to die" with all this insanity we have going on today.
From 007 to 00-Heaven, RIP Sean
R.I.P. Sean Connery (1930-2020).
You are the best r.i.p
My personal favorite The Hunt For Red October.   Followed by The Untouchables, Finding Forrester, and The Rock. Coolest James Bond, period end of story. 😎
My fave film was He'll drivers with some of the best British actors ever
I’ve enjoyed many years of his talent and work-by far the best James Bond and a brilliant actor!!!  The world lost an all time great today and he will be greatly missed.  Prayers go out to all loved ones he left behind. May God help heal your hearts for your loss🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻♥️
The dude finally kicked the bucket. Anyone who lived pass the age of 80 is asking for the bucket.
Loved him in the Hitchcock movie 'Marnie'.  RIP Sir Sean Connery 🙏
Im really going to miss jim cause he looks like my dad..i loved him on n the untouchables
Simply The Best.
The most well played, realistic and believable Bond was this guy who created the character on the screen. The rest were caricatures of the real thing.
Legends never die....😥
There was only ONE James Bond
Whenever I went to a bar, I always say "Shake it not stir."  R.i.p 007, you will forever be the greatest agent of all time.
Goodbye Mr Bond.
Rest in pease Thomas sean connery 1939 2020

“You wanna get Capone? Here’s how you get him. He pulls a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That’s the Chicago way. And that’s how you get Capone!” —The Untouchables
My grandpa died this morning too. I hope he and Sean Connery are in a better place now. Prayers to the Connery family.
oh my..the world has truly lost a Rock!
He was the Bond!! He was my favorite James Bond actor.
They forgot his role in Darby O'Gill and the Little People.
I'm speechless 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
finnnnneeeee old man
We need a world wide Sir, Sean Connery Day . We need to raise our glasses , shaken not stirred , Forever Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿💕
Why bother to get knighthood when advocating for Scottish independence? I’m so confused
There can be only one those were the words of Ramirez from highlander
What a wonderful actor Sean Connery was. I love watching all of his Bond movies. I like watching tennis matches & Mr Connery was at some of these matches. It was always good to see him enjoying these matches. I have always thought he was  such a lovely man & will remember him that way. America movie industry has lost a wonderful actor even though Sean Connery was Scottish born he was still a beautiful soul in my eyes.  RIP 🙏 Condolences to Sean Connery Family 🙏
A great man. One of my heroes. I will miss him. 😢
Truly the worst year in history
2020 definitely is the year to forget, and the worst part is, that it's not over yet 😞  RIP Sean Connery.... You will be missed.
Ugh, as you get older the more people pass away... RIP Mr. Connery, an icon both on and off the screen!
he was the definition and originator of " Cool " .   We love you Sean.
So many feminist and women keep abuse him on social media because his past. Stop try so hard to find other people past and mistake stop acting like you never do any bad thing
Heard he didn't particularly like 007 but was the greatest James Bond of them all! 😀
Rest easy Sailor:( You are missed.
Maybe next time Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 has an independence referendum they will finally do the right thing. 007
Rest in peace Shawn James Bond Connery

Rest in Peace Mr.Sean Connery. "Jesus said to her: “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who exercises faith in me, even though he dies, will come to life;   and everyone who is living and exercises faith in me will never die at all.  Do you believe this?”   She said to him: “Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one coming into the world."(John 11:25-28)
I’m just glad he lived what seems to be a good long  life...he will be missed
❤❤❤
He was state-of-the-art Connery in "Marnie."
Sean Connery wasn’t just and actor, he was the embodiment of James Bond, and all of the other roles he would protract on screen. There will never be an Sean Connery. RIP
Why was this the last thing in the world I expected to hear?
R.I.P MR. CONNERY, THE BEST EVER 007 FACTS.
2020 just keeps getting worse. 😭
Goat
working class, hero  lived in bahamas gets a knighthood  a real champagne socialist supporting the class structure of Great Britain yes a real Scotsman  and supporter to that distasteful royal family
Man such an icon every role he had he sold and all of them were box office smash. He was really a stand up guy RIP 007
His charms and charisma still felt today and forever
An engaging and powerful actor. My favorites of Connery's films are far too long to list. He was the epitome of Bond...there will be no other like him...his performance in "The Untouchables was stunning, I loved him with Catherine Zeta Jones in Entrapment. He will be soley missed... prayers to his surviving family. A great Scot!!!
RIP big man
RIP
I am so sad to hear about his death... He was a remarkable actor... Truly gifted!
💔🙏
"Greetings! I am Juan Sanchez-Villalobos Ramirez, chief metallurgist to King Charles V of Spain." Sean Connery may be dead, but his legacy is immortal.
Awww my heart is so sad to hear that he passed away prayers for his family
The Best James Bond 💖💖💖 May you Rest in Peace 🙏🙏🙏 Mr. Connery🙏🙏🙏
One of my favorite actors so sad but he lived a full life!
He's one of the best of that classic era. The very near best of all times , he will be missed. He will live on forever.  The man has a big life and may he be received in heaven in a bigger way. 🌺❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
R.I.P. Sean.
Darby I Hill The Rock kO RIP Sean 🙏🎵☘️🎶💚
RIP you are a legend 🙏🏻⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐🙏🏻
Noooo, not Mr. Connery!
Rip Sean loved all your movies The Only James Bond 🙏🙏🎵☘️🎶
Sorry to see him go. Sean Connery was a fine example of a strong, proud man.  Something not praised so much these days with all this Anti Male rhetoric about so called toxic masculinity. I know a young man who was let go from a job at a university because they said he had too much of a male presence (He drives a truck with an NRA sticker on it and is a unapologetic conservative).  He is a good person and respects all people. They just didn't like his political views. Something he did not advertise with the exception of his truck and sticker. He by the way could have brought a law suit against the college for sexism but chose not too. I wish he did. He would have won. Anyway, going to miss Sean Connery. He was "The Man"...our loss is heaven's gain. Rest in Peace Mr. Connery.
Wow! Finally, not fake news from them. RIP-Sean.
Another great performance by Sir Sean was in The Hill...R.I.P Sir Sean Connery...always and forever Bond.
Great Respect & Love Sean RIP ...https://www.redbubble.com/shop/ap/61281844
Rip!!! So shocking 😭 but happy he died peacefully in his sleep. Condolences to his family

RIP, Mr. Connery.  Yes, he was a heartthrob, but so much more! Honesty and integrity are timeless, and I hope that that is what he'll be remembered for.

Loved Sean Connory! Loved him as James Bond and afterwards. His performance in The Untouchables was superb! What a life-we' ll miss you Sir💜💜👼💜
Although he was one of the lesser 007's  he was much more than a man with thick, rounded eyebrows and an unintelligible accent. So much more! He was Indy's dad!
One of my favorite Bond.
He was Great in Highlander
The world has lost one of its most talented actor, sad day
RIH u will be missed praying for his family
So sad, he was such a blessing to the world.
What about King Author and A League Of Fine Gentleman!He was our Movie Star ⭐️
RIP
I first saw Mr. Connery in "Darby O'Gill and the Little People". I was a child then. After his bit appearance in "The Longest Day" he starred in the 1st Bond movie and his career skyrocketed. I loved this guy. May you Rest In Peace Mr. Connery. You will be sorely missed.
🕊R.I.P. 🕊🍸⚘Mr.Sean-#007 Connery.

Rest in peace Sir Connery. Rest in Power !!
Sad loss 007 ..
Goldfinger is my favorite James Bond's movies.. I am so sad... What  a terrible year is  2020...
Search The Anglo Saxon Mission on You Tube.  You will be astonished by finding out who made the Coronavirus. There are more to come.  Wake up people!
So sad to hear the passing of Sean...  Mr. 007   Bond.. James Bond.
Loved him, my opinion, the best James Bond
Sean Connery died but Ramirez will live forever
RIP 007
Two of the best James Bond are dead . Sean Connery and Roger Moore are dead. My first Bond movie I saw at the theatre was Moonraker.
RIP Sean Connery
bless his soul named one of my sons after him
R.I.P. Sean Connery :(
Farewell 007
Sean Connery Thunderball into stardom because you can Never Say Never Again when You Only Live Twice. Rip, you shall never be forgotten because you're diamond and Diamonds Are Forever.
The best James Bond there ever was and ever will be!!
Love all his Bond movies❤️ still watching 20/20. RIP Mr. Bond 007🙏❤️🙏
I loved him in Thunderball...R.I.P. Sir Sean Connery :'(
RIP OO7 🙏🕊🕊
Uh oh now what am i gonna do for a body double?   Sigh.
REST IN PARADISE SEAN CONNERY 🌹
RIP ❤️
Good bye sir till we meet again😊
That's SIR Sean Connery.
End of an era
God his name is Sean Sean connery take good care of him he was a talented actor and good man r.i.p. first James Bond
we will miss u
Rest in peace! You were a giant between people. You have been part some of the biggest movies in the history.
2020. Not even MI6 could overcome
I loved Sean Connery on SNL
what a sad day!!... james bond vhs with pink panther intro's were my child hood!
Best ever. Just love his deep, deep rusty voice that could melt your heart.  RIP ❤
My favorite movie of his was Finding Forrester.  Not as well known as his other films but it shows what a tremendous actor he was.  He made the film.  Especially the scene at the pitcher's mound at Yankee Stadium talking about his brother who had passed.  Gets me every time.  If you haven't seen it yet, it worth a look.
R.I.P. James Bond
May he enter his solar body and continue his existence in the aether. Truly a legend.
"Do you expect me to talk Goldfinger?" No Mr. Bond...I expect you to die!" Hands down, the best 007 in my opinion.  R.I.P.
Biden insists Mr. Connery died from Covid. Trump killed James Bond.
I really loved him!!!!! I hope he knew the Lord Jesus Christ as His savior. Once a man to die and after that the Judgement!!!
What a wonderful Man.IHe shall be truly missed.
Welp! They skipped right over his complicated past of being abusive and domestic violence. Wish others could get the same treatment in death. RIP Sean Connery. 🕊
Beautiful tribute until the news ladies   No class
RIP......we 💕❤️💕 you.
A truly amazing person and to many god. The best actor ever. Only person in his league is morgan Freeman.  World has lost a 4th dimension being.
Sean Connery thought it was perfectly fine to "slap a woman, once in a while".  I never watched another Sean Connery project after he made that comment.
Great Actor
R.I.P....!!!!  THE   BEST!!!!   "007"   DJB@NEPA....     DJB43.....{☆☆☆☆☆}-&-《♡♡♡♡♡》-!!!!!☆☆☆☆☆
Oh boy! Shocking news... I wonder if my son knows? I named him after SEAN CONNERY... I better call him...
The first movie I ever saw him in was "The Hunt for Red October" then he dies in October. I'd say 90 years is a good run though.
Great actor. Will be missed. My condolences.
RIP Sir Sean Connery. An absolute legend. Also a legend with the most sexiest voice
Sad. Did not know he was ninety.  A real icon of MASCULINITY and not soy boy nonsense that came later.
RIP! Salute!
"Sometimes you got to giver' a good schmack."
Rest in God’s memory until Christ returns.
A great role model!
I have loved Sean Connery forever.He has always been my favorite actor. RIP Mr. Connery
Ahhh so sad. He was a great actor. RIP 🙏🏻
Hail and farewell.
RIP, the best Bond ever
He was truly legendary and always will be.
My favorite actor,,,and favorite Bond,
_He's reunited in the quickening..._  _...Rest in Power Mr Connery!_
Just when I thought 2020 couldn't get even worse...
can 2020 get even worse???
😭
Always thought that man was fine and a brilliant actor. RIP Legend
Rest in Peace Legend
NO NO NO! Not Connery! wtf...
He was born the same day and year as my grandmother, and she’s still alive and kicking. Such an inspiring person and actor, he will be missed.
The first movie I saw Sean Connery in was Darby O'Gill and the Little People. Of the cup of life, he enjoyed a full measure.
RIP Sean 🥺. Two of my favorite movies are Extraordinary Gentlemen and Highlander.
What a Legend, RIP Sir
RIP Mr Connery. From a time when men were men.
rip condolences to his family and friends left behind, he will forever be remembered as the original Bond, James Bond
🙏 what a very talented man. One of the most iconic bonds, may he rest in peace.
Perfect example of "toxic masculinity."  Gosh I'm going to miss him!!
You wanna know how to get Capone? They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. *That's* the *Chicago* way! And that's how you get Capone. Now do you want to do that? Are you ready to do that? I'm offering you a deal. Do you want this deal?......Sean Connery's very best as Jim Malone in 1987's, "The Untouchables."☺👍
He was very old and he died peacefully in his sleep. I think that's a good ending to a king's life. I'm happy I got to see him in movies. He was an outstanding man from what I saw. He wasn't the typical Hollywood elite. RIP.
And that movie with Zellweger
What a great actor x Infact he was my favourite James Bond x And a beautiful charming gentleman also  x RIP Mr sean Connery 😇😇🙏
Going to miss you sir God be with you.
2020 strikes again
The real James Bond
RIP Mr. Connery!! James Bond out!! Fly high
REST IN POWER MR.BOND🙏
Diamonds are forever
Hack
Who cares
Great actor and very handsome
His role in the highlander is still one of my favorites and the rock. May Heaven be large enough for his kind spirit.
I remember him for Indiana Jones and League of Extrordinary Gentlemen. What a class act. Rest in peace, Mr. Connery.
Honor Blackman, Diana Rigg and now Sean Connery RIP to them
He was sooooo handsome! !!
HIGHLANDERS TEACHER
I'm watching finding Forrester tonight.  I grew up on Sean Connery as bond and later on in his many other films.  He is one of the best actors I've seen.
Best Bond ever .  RIP ....we will miss you Mr Connery.
Why did this news bring a tear?
The real 007
Thank you so much Sean for all the movies you have left us to remember you by. You have earned a rest in Heaven.
I believe he was a real man!
R.I.P Mr.Sean Connery man this came like a thunder from a clear sky just what an amazing actor and person i have watched Goldfinger so many times and The Hunt for Red October i mean classic,  if you haven't watched Highlander watch it,  this really breaks my heart i understand he's 90 but wow i just wanted him to live more.

R.I.P. Mr. 007 😔
My eyes are swollen with tears. One of my favorite actors (and people) of all time. Always a gentleman. God bless you Mr. Connery, thank you for sharing your talent with the world. You will be truly missed.
Don't forget about his role in Highlander...
Everyday we lose a creative and talented mind. Rest In Peace
As black women I have loved that boy!

Honor and highest regard to the great Sean Connery. His talent,his presence and distinct voice will be greatly missed. James Bond will return in our memory and our hearts. For Sean Connery.
You forgot highlander,  Why is the sky blue😁😁
Trump 2020!!!
Happy Halloween...I guess 😑
Preston, Boseman and now Connery
1:44 Well, I know what Cara Delevingne will look like in 20 years..
RIP Mr Bond
OMG!  I didn’t know.  Hunt for Red October is one of my favorite movies!  I really liked him.  He will be sorely missed.  RIP my friend.
Respect/God Bless
He also played Quartermaine in The League of Extraordinary Men!  <3. Loved him
The one and true 007. Father of franchises and modern blockbusters. Only one to have a career that possibly surpasses the entire 007 franchise #RIP007
The only James Bond, thank you RIP.
L E G E N D  Sean Connery has the best film legacy I've ever known & loved! I'm so glad we got to have him in our lifetime. The World itself &  Cinema will never be the same without him!  Rest Forever In Peace you perfect Legend, we'll miss you August 25, 1930 - 2020
One of the familiar rocks in our lifes....he was a sh-te for sore eyes
RIP
He did not die, He passed away have some respect.
RIP to a very inspirational person. His acting helped us all figure things out in life, as we were growing up. The entertainment value of his movies was legendary.
Such a tragic situation, the people they’re thinking of replacing Bond with nowadays. Connery was the best.
R.I.P  Sean Connery
Rip,mr connery you were a fine actor and man and you will be sorely missed.
RIP
Legend
“WELCOME TO THE ROCK.”  Ride Into Paradise Sean Connery.
Such a great actor, Rest in Peace.
In his youth wasn't he Mr. Scotland in a body building contest?  He was IT and with his sad passing there will never be another of his like.  I hope Sean has a tranquil and restful trip into the Beyond.
My true inspiration for diving rip SC
Oh dear..RIP! I loved him as an actor..
The highlander, a dragon heart, and a knight, RIP
Very bad day of worst year2020. Watching this short clip about Sir Connery took me back with the speed of light to the early 1960's as me and my college friends go to watch the James Bond with fascination and discussions extended to the next new movie out. He was great, genius, able to make us live and love his acting. God bless your soul Mr Bond, James Bond. Peace!!
2020 takes another good one :(
All that time in Scotland throwing logs pays off when you get to compete for Mr Universe.
I just watched the rock for the 1st time week a few weeks ago. Man this hits hard
In today's WOKE culture.....he would be called a Male Chauvinist Pig. Not to me,  Mr.Testosterone Galore !
What a man, actor and icon....
I’m surprised they didn’t mention highlander, there can be only one Sean Connery
R i p Sean Connery. I it hope that this won't mean 2 weeks of "news stories" about  "10 dark secrets of sean connery. Number 5 will leave you speechless" Just pay your respects media, and leave it at that.
🥺
It was an honor to have lived while he was alive.
My favorite James Bond.  Sorry he's gone. Prayers for his family and friends.
a great actor and a true gentlemen.  rip sean
Weird that Roger Moore also lived 90 years😯. Rest in peace Mr Bond.
Sean will always be my James Bond. I loved all his work and had a young crush as perhaps many girls did. I always wanted to meet him.  A scottish saying,  Paulo Coeloho Aleph -  "Never. We never lose our loves ones. They accompany us; they don't dissappear from our lives. We are merely in different rooms."
Best Bond ever. R.I.P Sir Sean Connery! ❤️
Fu**ing BBC! The nerve of them to berate him as JB actor.  He is James Bond.
I loved his roles in the Highlander movies. I'm going to miss this man for a long time.
Every living politician could die tomorrow, and I still wouldn't care nearly as much as I do about Sir Connery. The man who became a Knight by acting the King.
The only real. ..Bond...James Bond 007... R.I.P. Sean Connery....Sincere Condolences to the Family...
I was around 9,  when my dad took me to see 'Thunderball'......my introduction to the world of James Bond.   The  photo of Connery on the cover of LIFE magazine.   I think he was in an orange wetsuit,  with a speargun & looking like he meant business.    And I sometimes miss my 'official' Secret Agent 007 attache case.
The best ever James Bond.
RIP master...
A true gentleman like no other. Thank you sir for all you gave us. RIP
He put the swag in swagger. Rip beautiful man.
REST IN PEACE 🙏🏽❤
rip, i will. love faking his accent still thou
R.I.P 007...You were my favorite Bond, James Bond...Sean Connery was an outstanding actor and will be missed 😔

Bet they blame it on COVID19.
RIP sean Connery 🙏James bond was my favorite moive legend
RIP! best James Bond👍
Sean lived full and died empty !!! RIP !!!
Congratulations, CBS, on having a video that isn't completely overtaken by dislikes.  If you want more likes then you need to understand this hint: Sean Connery good, Discovery bad.
Last of the real man dies...
The untouchables. My favorite movie.
The best Bond.
I’m heartbroken, I really loved him, he was phenomenal! He was the quintessential Bond, no one could do it better! Rest in power and peace my hero💔
The real 007. He was the best "James Bond", hands down... R.I.P Sean Connery.
AND... the new Bond movie is titles "No Time to Die"... RIP Mr. Bond!
RIP Senor.....
The one and only James Bond. The one and only Ramirez.  The one and only Henry Jones....well Henry Jones Sr.
One of the great ones.  Long career. God Bless You
I will continue to watch his movies till I pass.. That's how great he was...!!!   His movies were for the whole family to watch..  Such a Good man...

It’s year just keeps on taking and taking and taking
he also did voice for a few cartoons
He's my James Bond and always has been..........RIP 007.
2020 is getting worse
Wow
Danny is great, but for everyone the one and only Bond.  Hope he meets up with Poosy!  God bless him, the Raisuli, Danny, Jimmy.
He may not have been the first Bond, but but he was the greatest, and every other so-called bond afterwards know this. Thank you also Sean for becoming a Russian Capt named Rameus with a bit of Scots accent. and Dr. jones father! I pray they bury you with your kilt on sir with the most dignified royal like funeral that Scotland has to offer. Please rest in peace. And while I'm at it. May all the fellow bonds be your pall bearers.
RIP Sean. The epitome of manliness!
Rest In Peace Mr. Connery. You definitely left your mark.
Sean Connery is one of the few guys who could pull off playing a leading role while wearing not much more than a red cloth diaper and a rifle...  ...and he was the best Soviet Navy captain with a Scottish accent ever...  ...yeah, I’m gently teasing a bit—but how did he pull off those roles in _Zardoz,_ _Red October_ and, yeah, the Bond films?  Tremendous charisma and commitment!
RIP SEAN AND I LOVED YOU
This is so sad!!! RIP LEGEND🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
R.I.P our favorite actor rest in peace we will miss you best James Bond ever
He will be missed
There was and never will be a greater James Bond than he was! All the others were shadows of him! He was a great actor! So many films that stand out, the one that comes to mind that I loved was the hunt for red October! He will be missed!
Nooooooooo!!!! This can’t be
A man's man rest in peace

WOW CBS actually reported something in the news rather than blowing smoke for Joe Biden who is under investigation by the FBI for receiving billions from China, Ukraine and Russia. Good Job CBS. Now if you would start reporting real news more often.
Sho shad...

Rip Mr Connery, he's one of my favorite actor.
Rip he shall be missed
Wow, I don't know weather to like  or dislike this. :(   Goldfinger remains one of my top all time movies.
My Dad took me to see Goldfinger when I was about 10, and I was hooked on 007, Ian Fleming and Sean Connery from then on. My favorite scene was in "You Only Live Twice" when he was "buried" at sea, scubas brought him into the British sub, they unzipped the bag and he stood up in his dress blues and said to the Captain "permission to come aboard Sir".
I liked him very much... he had charisma! God bless him.
Never seen a single 007 movie, but he was a legendary actor. RIP
They don't make them like that anymore, RIP.
RiP......James Bond
Rest well Sean Connery ❤️
Ah man, 2020 keeps on giving...
We lost one of the greatest actors of our times. The first original James Bond! Loved " Goldfinger". Also loved Disney's Darby o gill and the little people. RIP Sir Sean Connery!
He got out just in time, as the noose tightens around the world and the 13 families are about to force us to take the mark of the beast.  Good for him!
I loved him in Marnie
Best Bond ever Rest In Peace James Bond aka  Sir Sean Conner
James Bond can’t die!
Losing so many greats 😭

I'm shaken AND stirred,,,,,😞
Sean Connery may have been the first James Bond on the big screen, but I will always remember him best as Juan Sánchez-Villalobos Ramírez. Rest in peace, "you Spanish peacock".
You will be truly missed ,rest in peace ,James Bond, medicine man.
I'll have a martini,shaken,not stirred! In your honor Sir!!!
Great Actor!! He will truly be Missed!!
Great actor, full life.....what more can on ask for?

Damn Sean Connery my guy. League of extraordinary gentlemen. Rip Gentleman. Your soul definitely is with the creator.

😭

Nooooo!
R.I.P MR. CONNERY,
Loved him truly. Oooh James! 💔
The only thing that made me angry with Sean Connery was that every time he came on the Screen, my lady friends would stop talking or even look at me until the movie was over!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Loved the guy, he was a classic. He was cremated; Asked that his ashes be shaken not stirred...007 forever!

So long...............
Great Bond.  Great actor.  Or is this Russian disinformation?
Bond.....James Bond. Forever.
Best James Bond. Period.
Natural Causes = Covid Prolly. Rip
No mention of ZARDOZ? Heretics!
TIME IS RUNNING OUT GET SAVED OR GET LEFT BEHIND .........JESUS has showed me in many powerful Holy spirit filled dreams and visions that the RAPTURE being Caught up is very soon to take place in the blink of an eye the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first then I was shown BIG BEAUTIFUL ANGELS coming out of the sky taking ALL those in Christ and all the children in the world out of harms way . we were ALL taken up to heaven with Jesus . then the worst time ever in the history of the world will begin THE TRIBULATION . I was shown all those left behind will be LIED to. people on the news will say UFOs with Aliens took us or other made up lies and not the truth . people the world will be lied to because satan is in the detail and to all those who will be left behind please know JESUS TOOK US .... all bible prophecy is coming to pass every day at speed GOD is warning and showing us get saved through his son JESUS CHRIST who died and rose again to give you Eternal life in his kingdom John 3.16 . pray and ask JESUS today to be your lord and Savior ask him to forgive you of your sins and in that moment he will save and seal you in the holy spirit and give you eternal life Jesus LOVES YOU and wants NO one to perish . but ONLY JESUS has the power to save your soul . only those who are taken will see the GLORY of GOD as the Angels take us up to meet the lord in the air . those left behind will not . they will only witness in the blink of an eye people vanish from this world . we are in the end times please make today the day of your salvation because we are not promised tomorrow and when we leave we take nothing with us so please get your heart right with the lord . God put it strongly on my heart to send my message for all to hear and I speak the TRUTH no one knows the day or hour but we are in the season and we are the generation I was shown I will never die on this earth I am going UP in the rapture alive and so are ALL those in christ . God said in the last days he will pour out his spirit and give dreams and people all over the world are being told by Jesus he is coming to take us home God bless and sent with love Xx
Another legend lost. He will be sadly missed. RIP Sir Sean Connery.

Terrible year.
Rest In Peace
RIP.  CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY

Rest in peace. I hope you in heaven where you don't have to be in this ugly world anymore. You was a great actor
RIP chad
RIP Sean
Rest in Peace, Sean Connery
That's _Saint_ Sean to you unbelievers. ...The cult has begun in earnest.
His legacy speaks his life...a great actor...James Bond..may u rest n peace.
R I P 007 thank you for All the great memories
Peaceful passage, Sir Sean  For Auld Lang Syne
resht in peash.
He supported Trump! Great smart and brave! Rest in heaven!
My mother loved his acting.  Maybe there both in Heaven binge watching his movies...LOL.  I was too young  to really follow his works, but from what I saw of him, you could tell he was a versatile actor who took command of the stage and his roles eloquently and effortlessly.  Rest up big guy, you’ll be missed.
I blame the league of extraordinary gentlemen for his retirement from making movies
He made older men sexy.
RIP 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Re elect Trump was his last words!!
Come on folks....it’s Hollywood....an actor, nothing special...let’s put this in perspective.....
What a total shame with this remarkable actor. He was really amazing in his performances. Life will go on but I send my condolences to his family, friends and his fans world wide. Being a British American duel Citizen with being raised in both Countries since birth a few times, I was raised following his movies. He was absolutely amazing ❤️!
I will never forget the film  Gold Finger watch with my dad in my early age,no one can replace Sean Connary. Herve from Mauritius
NO NO NO NOT TRUE 😵😭😭😭
Icon is a understatement. RIP Sean Connery
Rip
I agree. I support pro-life except for one instance, which is rape, or if the child was conceived without the consent and willingness of both people. So with issues like this one, it's difficult for people to vote for either side. Aside from all other policies, abortion and gun control are one of the largest controversies.
did those female hosts just sexual harassed Sean Connery by saying how sexy he was? A male host would be fired for using that type of language
RIP
F
OMG! WOW! THE TRUE BOND! 😪! HE IS BOND! My Mother took me to see His 007 Films. I always Believe She had a major crush on him. RIP 007! 😑!
My wife and I met this old couple about 10 yrs ago,  I believe they were French but lived in the USA,  the man looked so much like Sean Connery and without asking he comented that he used to be a stunt man for 007 James Bond back in the day. RIP both.
Bond and mason his best characters the rock was a sweet movie and so are all the bonds except this no time to die that’s going to destroy the series
What a great loss. Love all his films.
Darby O'Gil and the little people. One of first. Check it out
Who is the real James Bond? Answer: Connery, Sean Connery.
He was a wonderful talent. His legend will live on in his performances. Thank you for all of the entertainment you gave us. You will be treasured and missed. RIP Sir Sean Connery.
Rest in peace Sean Connery. From Vietnam
Rest in perfect peace.
RIP 007
Sean Connery was and always will be a legend!  But everyone forgets, or thinks it a footnote, that he was a Sailor before he was an actor.  "Military and/or Militia service, makes the launchpads for legends. What those who have those launchpads do, will determine their legend." -John J. Price, Jr. (1961-2016)
Oh nooo!  I loved his acting, he will be sorely missed!
Great 007.   RIP.
Rest in Peace Mr. Bond, James  Bond.!
Rest in peace
A knight. The original Bond. A true icon. Rest well sir.
Dragonheart!! One of my favorite movies
Greatest guys I love the guy he was the best ,the world will mis him
Man 2020 isn't giving us any breaks huh
Anybody check into Clancy Browns whereabouts around the same time when all this happened?
Rest in Power to the greatest Bond of them all.but finding Forrester is my favorite Sean Connery movie.
Simply the best!
Anyone surprised MSNBC is honoring Sean even though he was 'old school' with his views of marital duties.  Simply, he was not PC.
The Hunt For Red October is one of my favorite movies. Farewell Mr. Connery.
How truly sad to know he's gone but never to be forgotten.. His debonair, Scottish good looks always reminded me of my dad. He will be very missed. Thank you for being you & R.I.P.💋❤
Ugh.....LOVE LOVE LOVE HIM ❤️
Heroes are remembered and legends never die. In the acting Community Sean Connery is a legend his career is going to go down in history. Sean Connery is literally one of my most favorite actors I love all of his movies and i will remember him.  I would ask you to please play tribute to this man go and watch your favorite Sean Connery movie today and remember.  Rest in peace Sean, your Legacy will live forever.  ❤
2020 strikes again
He escaped alcatraz!!!
“From Russia with Love” was the first movie I was allowed to go see by myself— needless to say I fell in love with Sean Connery and this thing never really ended—just hearing his voice......my only child who is 43 was named after him....another part of my youth has passed..RIP and thanks for some pleasant memories...
lets play some 007
Rest in peace
Rip...my man...
The world is a little less brighter today, R.I.P
Media will say covid
Damn you 2020, no more. The first and best Bond.
My condolences to His friends and family. He was a talented actor.
He had a good life . Let him enjoy death now
😢😢🥺😔
Why don't you lie and say he died from Corona and his last dying wish was to ask you to vote for Biden. It's right up the line with your reporting Ethics
The man that would be king...he was.
"Shaken not stired"😍   rip SC.
Rest in Peace 007 Mr Sean Connery, Thank you for the movies! Roger Moore welcomes you in heaven
Noooooooo
Michael Chrighton's Rising Sun!! Highlander!! ... C'mon man...not even a quick mention!!
2020 The perfect year to escape the Rock RIP...
RIP Mr Bond!
While growing up I watch all of Mr Connerys bond films! And thus where I learned how to be charming and smooth! Rip Sean Connery!
Rip
First James Bond movie I ever saw at the theater was Diamonds Are Forever.  I think Sean Connery mad the best James Bond of all.
Such a fine actor that could be dramatic, then comedic and switch back to drama, all in the same scene!
R.I.P.  Sir.♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏
Just thinking about him the other day, now he is gone. For my 60 th birthday my wife threw me a surprise James Bond Party. All my family and friends were dressed as characters from the Bond movies. My daughter even painted herself all in gold! I had to guess which character they were all portraying. I saw all the movies hundreds of times so I got 100%! R.I.P. Sir Connery.
truly will be missed... thank you sir and thank you for the last time! respect
R.I.H.
He will be missed!  Yes, he was a hunk for sure!  He was the best James Bond!
That Barbara Walters interview will live on for generations to come.
Rip Sir ❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏
My favorite actor.
My favorite Bond agent. He waa a great actor
He was SIMPLY  Amazing
He wasn't the best Bond ever he was the only Bond I love him James Bond 007
RIP to the true James Bond
MGM should make No Time to Die go to PVOD or Hulu or Peacock instead of April 2021 movie theatre release. MGM talked with Netflix and Apple TV to make No Time To Die move to these streaming services instead of movie theatres and got rejected on these 2 streaming deals.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😭☹️☹️☹️
RIP Mr Bond
I grew up watching all of his movies,   heard about his passing this morning 😢may  he Rest In Peace.
NOBODY did it better. Simply the best.
R.I.P. Sean Connery
"Losers always whine about trying there best, winners always f*ck the prom queen" -Mason. Best movie from him in my opinion
Sad    Hate to see him go
This news has left me shaken but not stirred. RIP Mr. Connery.
Adrenochrome!
Yes It's OK now he 007 other place
Next will be Clint Eastwood
Both Sean Connery and River Phoenix leave us on Halloween (27 yrs apart). Sean played Indy’s father and River played Indy as a teenager. Harrison Ford...what chance he’ll leave us on Halloween years from now?
I hate 2020 SOOO MUCH ....
The ONLY Bond
BEST BOND EVER.  Scotland's favorite son will be missed.  RIP
I was just watching “The Hunt For Red October” just 2 days ago to acknowledge its 30th anniversary & now this news 🤦‍♀️ Sir Sean was legendary & one of the greats to do it. May he Rest In Peace 🙏
Omg...I loved him!! Rip!
Condolence to the family and Rest in Peace sir
RIP Sean Connery.. I love you.
You will be missed Mr. Connery, and 100% without a doubt the best bond of them all.
Whoa 😳
RIP Sean Connery. You will be missed dearly.
:(
Snl skits won't really be funny now😔😢
Amazing man. He will be missed.
Wow finally some real news from cbs . Back to lies after the segment.
Schlapping hoes in the after world now.
THE JAMES BOND MOVIE WOULDN'T BE KNOWN  IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU !  RIP SIR SEAN CONNERY !
Oh no.....my favorite actor.....
A true icon, even if he was not an exemplar of the modern man.  Thus my emotions upon hearing of his passing are mixed:  Shaken, not stirred.  Mr. Connery is survived by his wife, Alex Trebek and Trebek's mother.
A humble man who loved his country, took nothing for granted, portrayed sex-appeal without really trying. We’ve seen others play the Bond role, but no one as yet, has surpassed him. He will forever remain the bench mark. I first saw him on the big screen as a teenager. He filled the screen, disturbed my thoughts, and changed my naive perception of what a sexy man is all about. He is an icon, and leaves a huge hole. Thank you for engaging us in your “Scottishness” and your huge talent.
To the Stars Bowen. Never stop fighting until the fight is done.
RIP SC☖ Bond loved you man..
The world is a worse place without him.  Rest In Peace, Sean Connery.
God bless you will be missed
Rip sir billi
Classic actor that was part of a time when movies were actual movies with storylines, and one of the original tough guys in movie history. Rest in peace Mr. Connery
Rest In Peace to a legend
Bond, James Bond
Rest in peace sir
Oh no.
R.I.P. to the second best Bond. What a fine Bond he was. But not as fine as Roger Moore.
Love him a lot.
Another idol 💀
RIP 007 🙏🏼💐⭐️💕
💔😔
Another one?
Noooooo 😟😭
2020!

Damn...he was the "James Bond" all others were measured by.
James Bond I’m on a mission
Thank you Sir, for a lifetime of great entertainment. God bless
Very nice summary thank you
And when he became the captain for the Hunt for red October he played that part with expertise perfect to the rim
It was...No Time to Die.

Rip to this legend. He will be missed.
Rip 007. My favorite movie with him was "The Rock" with Nick Cage.....classic 90's flick.
I am very sad that he has passed away he was a very good actor we are going to miss him
We have lost one of the best actors in the world
Who is the anchor at the end who exclaims "So Sexy!!!'  Wonder what kind of backlash would have happened if a male anchor exclaimed  that about a female actress upon her death.
I wore out the James Bond movies as a kid. Go with God 🙏 IISOUS YESHUA JESUS CHRiST, Sean, you're in my prayers
I’m 70 and he will always be my 007, James Bond. I would suggest a Disney Movie Darby O’Gill and the Little People.
A true uncommon gentlemen condolences to his family rip good man go with God dignity and integritys pure epitome 😔😔😔...
he will be remembered.  may he finds peace
His movies are legendary, and his acting was extraordinary. RIP Mr. Connery.
I dont believe it
The real James Bond is Joe Biden except he is crooked. Why is the real news about Hunter/Joe Biden taking big money from foreign powers being blacked out. We have Hunter Biden's lap top and the big guy gets a cut. Tony Bobulinski testified that Joe Biden knew all about the money from foreign countries and was in fact the big guy. This is a serious danger to being blackmailed by China or Russia or Ukraine if he became President. Kiss your liberties goodbye!
The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen............😔😔😔😔
RIP to the 🐐
Legends Never Die. Rest Easy Brother !
There can only be one! RIP
RIP my favorite bond
Sean "I AM the last one!" Connery RIP.
Im done w/ u 2020, you win ; _ ;
Sean Connery was a great man and a smart liberal. Rest in peace :)
I saw a reruns of his old James Bond movies they were pretty cool an amazing actor this guy may his soul rest in peace now🤔🙏
You were the best bond ever,may you rest in peace 🌼
I've always thought he was the most handsome man on earth. The older he got the more handsome he was. RIP.
Rest in peace sir Dr. Jones in the last crusade
May God comfort his family.
Bond may endure in the movies, but there will never be another as great as Connery was.
I CANT BELIEVE HE DIED ON HALLOWEEN!!!! NOOOOOOO
2020 sucks. Lose Spartacus in February...lose Bond now. Climate crises, civil unrest, and toxic political rhetoric...this year blows. 2016 in a close second now.
Bond,......James Bond.  Such a great actor.
He was pro Scotland Independence 💪 Rest In Peace sir!🙏
SEAN CON!
One of the greatest actors ever, the actutoday are a joke
2020 just keeps kicking us while we're down. Great man and Actor he will be missed by many. Thank you Sean for Entertaining us all these years! #Rip007
Praying for peace to his families souls and comfort to their aching hearts. He was an Amazing Actor.. May he Rest in Peace.
I remember him for his smoothness and cool factor
Sean we never forget you,one of my favorite actor,god bless his family and RIP,my condolence to his, family🙏
A very sad day indeed.. R.I.P. Mr Connery..
A sad day in the world as a GREAT Actor is lost. My heart goes out to his family. Rest in Peace Sean. We all will miss you.
Diana Rigg, the only Bond girl that 007 married, passed just about a month ago.  Today, the man himself has left us.  A great light to our world, and I assure you to my youth and lifetime.  He was a legend in his own time, and I can only hope his legend will grow.  I hope Saint Peter greets him at the gate with a martini, shaken, not stirred.  R.I.P., Sir Connery.
How sad. When I was a small boy every male  kid wanted  to be James Bond. He was the coolest!
Sooooo handsome!
A blue collar Scottish boy who did well for himself.
RIP Sean Connery.
You are my bond
Bon voyages Sean

Wow end of an era.

LEGEND. ALBA GU BRATH.🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🙏
An actual news story (without spin) from this channel is nice to see! Rest in peace Sean Connery thank you for all the wonderful memories...
Another legend gone
Thumbs down because of the Biden ad at the beginning. He’s a corrupt politician!
The first, the original 007. Rest easy, Sir Sean.
Another time Highlander....
And 2020 strikes again
World has lost a great one.  Best Bond ever
R.I.P Sean
I didn't know he did a mr. Universe that's awesome
He definitely paved the way for the character "James Bond". Indiana Jones and the Hunt for Red October were legendary films for a legendary man! He's well known to play "tough as nails" characters! He lived a great life! He's with God now and may he rip!
Great man! None like him niwadays!
Just watched a couple of his movies 2 nights ago
gold finger, with the candel stick,in the library.
Rest In Peace, Mr Bond
Rest in power!!!
Rest in Peace Bond--James Bond.
He was a wonderful actor and my favorite
A great Scottish Gentleman.

Scottish? I thought he was welsh.
Ahh, Rest In Peace lovely gentleman.. ♥️🌹♥️

The charismatic gentleman. The confidence and poise this man has demonstrated is unbelievable. Mister Connery, thank you for all that you've given us.
Resht in peash
end of an Era. Rest in peace and joy.
My paternal grandma’s favorite actor among all the James Bond films and the other roles he did afterwards like in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (especially The Rock before she passed away herself back in June 2020). Respect, Sir Sean Connery.  A legend through and through. Miss you too, grandma.
The real James Bond forever you🕊🕊
Truly an amazing man! May God Bless and keep your soul🙏
RIP Scottish king!!👑💖🙏🏾 Such a wonderful actor and he seemed like a delightful person! He will be missed😔💔
"Welcome to the Rock!"
Have a good journey commander Bond...
Such a classy actor💗
Well that sucks. I liked him... RIP
R.I.P. Brillant actor, an icon for Scotland a great human being: Sir Sean Connery.
The only actor to admit its ok to slap a woman if she gets out of line. He will be deeply missed.  RIP Sean, my wife finally listens to me.
Rest in Peace, you were one of the greatest actors and standard for all mentor types
Sorry for the loss my condolences
We've lost one of the beat ever! RIP Sean!!!!
He is James Bond.  No one could fill his shoes in that role.
Truly a real great and talented brilliant actor I enjoyed watching his acting in his movies,you will be missed my friend ☹
RIP 007.
❤️🥺❤️ FORVER IN MY HEART AND WILL BE MISSED!
Best Bond EVER, indeed! Loved him in the Untouchables, and Hunt for Red October .... RIP Sir Sean Connery. 😇
Are they sure? They are going to blame it on covid? Or do they think president Trump hired someone ? I wouldn’t trust a known fact from these people ever again
90 years old is a blessing. He lived a great life and was a great actor. 🙏
Bruh. 2020 has NO chill.
Henry Jones Senior.
Thank you. A man’s man among men. God rest your soul.
“I’ll take ‘The Rapists” for 500, Alex.” —Sean Connery
I am heartbroken.  Sir Sean was my favorite actor; he was excellent in all genres. Always gave a stellar performance; add to that, an absolute hunk.  He'll always be remembered by his fans around the world. His films will always be seen. He'll always be loved.  My deepest condolences to his family.
He was the reason I became a James Bond fan!! I loved him in Hunt for Red October. He was definitely a great actor!! He played in some great movies..... that i have enjoyed..  R.i.P
R.i.p. I always pictured him as a awesome actor who could've played the role of Magneto with ease.
damn !
The best James Bond of all time 🙏🏽
when I heard this news I was like nooooo!!!!😱🤧
Rip 007
RIP , Mr Bond.
Rest in peace Sean, we'll miss you!
"Find me a dead cat." One of Sir Sean's best lines. Anyone know which movie it's from?
thank you  for beautifying the world sir, rest in peace
Such a talented actor rip sean
He defined cool.  Rest in peace sir.
This is truly a sad day ... As my first name is James ... He will be missed
Satan, can we trade all the leftists lives just for him? Ik it doesn't make up connery's worth but it's a good trade since you get all the filth of our country
Damn. Rip James
In 3 days nobody will talk about Van Halen..I mean Sean Connery
R.I.P  🙏🙏🙏✝️✝️✝️
WoW, a great actor and will be missed   Rest in piece sir Connery...
There's an ad for a oedophile before this vid
R.I.P.  Sir...
Forget about jame bond I would say Alcatraz
This morning, wikipedia said the cause of death was unknown, but that his headless body was found slumped over a sword, and now it's saying he died in his sleep. I prefer the first version. There can be only one sean connery.
Accomplished and Fine to boot, even at 90! RIP Mr. Bond.. forever the One and ONLY James Bond
Rip legend.
WOW who Thumbs down Sean Connery  Really!!!!
R.I.P Big man, great actor, many memorable movies, never disappointed. Gone, but not forgotten.

Damn it!!! Love this iconic actor....going on a Sean Connery movie binge.
A true legend... I will miss him terrible... Goodnight bond, james bond

RIP
You will always be missed!! Why do all the good people have to go!?!?!!!
RIP
We are losing our Priceless Gems one by one
The sound of millions of womens' hearts breaking.
Great now he'll never play a villain in a Bond Movie, instead of that they just wanted to play Racial and Gender politics. Missed opportunity.
I loved him on the rock
超喜欢他的电影，RIP
Sean may be "best bond ever," but he has shown great talent in every film he made. I've had a crush on him for years. May he rest in peace in the Lord's embrace.
Awe rip
R.i.p to a legend
RIP .I will miss you.
How sad ! Rest In Peace!
THE REAL DEAL !!!
"The Man Who Would Be King."  His greatest film after the James Bond films.
Rip! 007 James bond forever 🙏🌹❤
Wow, praying for the family
A Great influence in my life. You are missed Sir Sean.  and 'I will use only my thumb' .. Thumbs up, life well and honorably lived. We'll meet up down the road.
Noooooooo
RIP Sir Sean Connery !!! You Have Always Set A High  Standard Of Excellence !!!
Not "James Bond Actor." "James Bond!"
To my most respected actor. Thank You and God bless you
The Man Who Would Be King - my favorite movie.   He had a great career and I love every movie he made.
THERE WAS ONLY ONE JAMES BOND......SEAN CONNERY  ! HE HAD IT ALL..... HE WAS THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE. RIP .....007 💔💋
You forgot to mention his roles in Disney's "Darby O'Gill and the Little People" and his western with Bridget Bardot, in "Shalako"
If a movie had Sean Connery in it I watched it. As a kid I remember the adults watching 007 with Sean on Sunday night movies. But the first time I saw him at the movie theater it was in "Darby'O Gill and the Little People"  he was young, handsome and could sing! Boy, at 9years old I had a big crush!
2020 is just trash 😔
Good men do not hit women! https://youtu.be/oo0d1zTAFKA  for him I will not mourn.
God bless him 🙏🏻🌴Iranian pray to lord!
My favorite “007”.    RIP
So fake this people are!!!
Connery really paid his dues working as a milkman, coffin polisher, nude model, body builder, then movie star, he certainly lived a full life.
Blessings to his family. He will always be remembered for his talent, intelligence and wit. RIP Mr. Connery you will be missed.
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
OH NO!!! How weird I was literally was watching Goldfinger last night. I had no idea... Loved this man. A lot of guys did... Rest in Peace Sean. You will be deeply missed. God Bless you.
Great English movie star rest in peace may God receive his soul in hos eternal glory Noone like him todays Hollywood "Actors" don't even get close to any of the baby boomers actors
RIP SEAN!!! 2020 SUCKS!
🙏
This man was an iconic and everyone enjoyed his james bond movies RIP you are a legend

The best king Aurther I've ever seen !   So sad ! You will be missed , and a big Void has been left in Hollywood.
Now I can't unsee how he went out in The Untouchables
😰
Loved his accent. One of my favorite to imitate and punchline to one of my favorite jokes: What time does Sean Connery show up to Wimbledon? Tenish
Best james bomd
May he R.I.P.!!! 💙🙏 And was easy on the eye's!!!! 😉☺
Such a hunk!! Have all his movies..He had chemistry! Charisma!!
Well, damn. How many of us just assumed he was immortal? Don't forget he also was in the Highlander....
Rest in peace to Sir Sean Connery, one of the greats who played James Bond and played Henry Jones Sr. Why did he have to die on Halloween? This is sad.
The name’s Connery Sean Connery
Rest in peace Sean
*007 for Halloween, I am gonna miss him*
Biden a big corrupt old man 👴
Where are all the black people?? Or is this still when things were half decent
Iconic Bond actor dies in 2020. What a year. Ciao Sean.
All these broadcasters were not born yet when MR Bond retired from acting I believe.
He WAS and IS the best bond.
Such a great actor. Sean was one of the very best. 😥️
Great actor we lost an Icon. R.I.P.
RIP Untouchables Jim Malone, and with his last dying breath he asks the World (specifically America in regards to Nov 3rd) "WHAT ARE YOU PREPARED TO DO...?!?!"
One of the BEST ACTORS OF ALL TIME!
R.i.p friend you will be greatly missed 😢 😔
RIP Sean Connery
OMG!!! Noooooooooooo!!! My heart is broken! His voice will always be my favorite in the whole world/universe!! Rest In Peace My Scottland Love...
A great loss indeed. You will never be forgotten.
This is EXTREMELY SAD!!!!
TO All of Scotland!!    We mourn for you a True National Treasure, thank you for sharing!!
He is one of the good ones, rest in peace
Oh Nooo! I have always loved Sean Connery. Looks like this weekend will be a 007 binge. God Bless this man and may he Rest In Peace.
Best 007 of them all. RIP Sir Sean.🙏✝️
They just don't make actors like that anymore, definitely one of the greatest of all time. RIP..
RIP Sean Connery
My favorite movie of his was -- and I urge anyone who has not watched it to seek it out -- The Great Train Robbery.
I am Not Gonna Cry or Shed Tears of Sorrow and Pain! 2020 has done that already for me! I PRAISE SEAN CONNERY A SCOTTISH GENUINE MAN FOR HE'S GREAT CONTRIBUTION TO OUR SOCIETY AND MODERN TIMES BOTH IN ROLES OF ENTERTAINMENT AND LIFE. WE MUST CELEBRATE THIS MAN AS AN ACHIEVEMENT ROLE MODEL FIGURE! RIP SEAN CONNERY.
RIP Mr Connery, you will be missed
The best James Bond ever!
RIP
One of the GOATS! RIP 007
Guapicimo
HE WAS.SELF.EDUCATED  SAID HE WOULDNT RETURN TO.SCOTLAND UNTIL.IT WAS FREE. UNTOUCHABLES BEST WORK
No Highlander mention? Understandable  considering the circumstances.
A true and patriotic Scot. He lived a full life both personally and professionally. Condolences to his loved ones. I only wish he'd lived to see his final dream/wish of an independent Scotland come true. (unionists, please don't respond with hate, not trying to start an argument.)
It's just 2020....
Yes..no yess..noo yesss...ok
Still so handsome. He’s always been my absolute favorite!
Thank you SEAN CONNERY for doing your humane part to help tame mankind with your gift and talent. You will always be my favorite 007.
Just watched Time Bandits for the first time... uncanny
Descansa en Paz Sean: OO7
He was the only bond actor I liked
He was the Dos Equis man before the Dos Equis man. R.I.P. good Sir.
Nddjdndjdjsjsjs for znnzlzkzkzkzmsueiensjs
greatest bond ever!
Woah... what the.. I ..  I was just thinking about him.. for no particular reason..
I'm on to you trebek.
Everyone needs to give one ping only in memory of the captain.
The very best 007
❤️007 Sean Connery... 007  First and the best   I was 11 when I saw Dr No
He was the epitome of "strong, suave, cool and macho" for a generation boys who are now men and inspiration for future action heroes. There will never be another like him. Thank You. A fan for life.  Condolences to his friends and family.
We never really think the end will come.
RIP good sir and godspeed
R.i.p Sean Connery.  You always be remembered.  007 for life.
Love him... rest peacefully Sean.
We are losing so many people in 2020!!!
90 years old? Pretty good long life to me
RIP
My dad used to work in movies and met Connery at a premiere. My dad introduced himself the way Bond usually does and they had a good laugh about it. They took pics and everything.
So sad. May he Rest in Peace
Sorry to see you go😔
oh man, so many great roles, Resht in Peash, good shir
Great guy. You’ll be missed, Sir Connery
RIP, our thoughts and prayers for his family. God bless 🙏
great actor rip!
Damnnnnn
RIP Mr. Connery!!
I really like Sir Sean Connery.
God be with Sean Connery.
RIP Sean Connery. Thank you for everything that you have given to the world.
He is the best bond and a great actor!
Absolutely the best Bond ever! He's the one all the other Bonds are measured against. His screen presence was such that I still remember him in "The Longest Day", even though his role was a rather minor one. And, of course, he was great in two of my favorite films, "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" and "The Hunt for Red October"! I never tirer of watching either. RIP
Loved his interview with Barbara Walters.   https://youtu.be/oo0d1zTAFKA
You will be missed 007.
RIP. 😭😭😭😭
😢😢😢😢😢
i liked when he said that certain women are instigators and deserve to be smacked around a bit
Oh Nooooooo!
What the men wanted to be and who the women wanted to be with! RIP mr. Connery
So long Dragonheart
An absolute huge loss. God bless his family.
Well we have lost Sean and now the world is just a little bit darker keep drinking vodka martinis in heaven your wonderful man
90 years what a life he had RIP Sean
Who took his quickening?
first, we lost Roger Moore and now Sean Connery.  Whose next George Lazenby or dare I say, Timothy Dalton.
Sad R.I.P 🙏
He had a great run 90 years old. Best way to die in your sleep and in the Bahamas.RIP!!!
RIP MR. Sean and thank you for all ..
Don’t forget Highlander!!!!!!  Who wants to live forever?
2020 is like One Major Bond movie and Trump is the villain they even killed 007 and Kobe. They were both murdered.
Nooo, rip Sean
HE WHEN OUT 90 YEARS OLD. JUST PERFECT. TRULY  A WORLDWIDE  TREASURE . THANK YOU MR CONNERY.
I love him. Love the way he talks. Also sexy even in his older years. RIP.
I'm surprised CBS isn't blaming Trump for Sean Connery's death. RIP Sean.
you will be sorely missed    RIP sir
Great actor
Would you be sad still if you found out he was conservative?
He believed in hitting women! He admitted it on a television interview, so I don't feel bad about him passing.
Awwww man.laaammme.
R.I.P Sean Connery😭
My love. So sorry he is gone.
For me as a kid in the 60s ,there was only one James Bond for me and that is Sean Connery.  I am 63 years old now. I still feel the same way. RIP Mr. Connery. You are 007.
Thank you for all the fantastic moments in the theater.. you are still the standard all spies are measured by.
A legend of men, on and off screen. You will be sorely missed sir.  ❤️😢
Oh no!!! I named my son Sean because I was and still am a Sean Connery fan.
Time to watch Highlander :).
RIP  to all of the greats lost
Dam good life
The Bond against whom all Bonds are measured. But more than that; a good man. There’s a stunning lack of those in this world.
I loved his acting, and his voice. Anything that came on television with him in it, I watched. Regardless whether I've seen it 20 times or 200 times.
One of my favorite actors.  RIP Bond, James Bond
He had a very good life so it doesnt bother me, too bad Scotland never became free
Počivao u miru Božjem. Jedinstven, poseban. Hvala ti za svaki doprinos.
he will be missed
I can only think of a few actors whom I've loved every single role that they have played even though the movies that they were in were not my favorites and one of them is Sean Connery. My mother would agree and she's in heaven waiting to see him.
THE BEST BOND RIP 007.
RIP 007.
2020 is taking everything eh?
Forget "Bond. James Bond." My fav is "Greetings. I am Juan Sánchez Villalobos Ramírez; chief metallurgist to King Charles V of Spain. And I'm at your service."
Oh no!!! He’s my mom’s most favorite James Bond. May he R.I.P.
Dragonheart😞
Who cares about rich white people
Dang!!! Crazy!!!!!
RIP..Sean..💝💝😭😭🎈🎈
I'm very sorry to here this.  RIP to a true legend.
R.I.P sean. COnnery. The Rock Entrapment This man is and always will be a Legend to me
Wow this so weird me and my gf were watching old clips of celebrity Jeopardy from SNL the past few days. The guy impersonating him was hilarious. I asked my gf if she knew he was still alive. Then I see this today..RIP Sean.
🏆TRUE LEGEND
May God bless his soul. R.I.P
RIP, but not gonna lie, I didn't know he was still alive...😅
RIP
That's the Chicago way!
Farewell....Mr Bond😢
How very very sad
My favorite Bond, Connery will be sorely missed. May you rest in peace.
May you go on in the eternal world to continue to fulfill your destiny. Rest In Peace.
All the girls wanted him and all the guys wanted to be him.
RIP
Great great actor! Class act, one of a kind, iconic.
They forgot to mention his role as King Arthur with Richard Gere and Julia Ormond.
A world treasure. I will be watching his movies in memory of his legend 🙏
RIP sir..... Amazing innings
These people don’t care about Sean Connery. If they did they would mention his role in “The Rock”, which is probably the best 007 movie.
Rip to a legend. You’ll always be my favourite Bond Sir Sean Connery.
Bond, Ramirez, Ramius, Jones ... The screen wasn’t big enough for Sean Connery.
Rest in Peace Sean Connery
There can only only be one! RIP Highlander!
Damn damn damn. He was one of my favorite actors. He was my #1 James Bond
Yall left out HIGHLANDER!!! THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE
😢😢😢
"I've been in jail longer than Mandela, so maybe you want me to run for president."
His next film will be Sean of the dead.
RIP good sir.  Thank you for your gifts to us all.
The Rock was my favorite movie. May he rest in peace!
A sad day.
R.I.P. truly sad to hear
Very sad .His timeless movies will always lives on . May his precious soul rest in eternal peace.
RIP .he lived a good long life .
RIP Sean you will be missed greatest gone
2020 Strikes again. RIP. Kinda ironic that his last film role in a movie technically had a witch doctor performing a ritual over his grave, and Sean Connery died on Halloween.
To be honest I thought he was dead already
2020 now officially sucks now.
RIP Draco </3
Heaven just got another icon we will truly miss him to his family my respect and condolences to his fans like myself may God be with us all
RIP Sean Connery, I'll always remember you as Juan Sánchez-Villalobos Ramírez.  There can be only one.
RIP the OG We'll continue to shake, but not stir our martinis for you 😢
Rest in Peace, Best Bond EVER!🥺
Rest in peace. Hoping your martini is shaken not stirred in heaven.
Truly one of the greats. He will be missed.
RiP
Soylent Green applies. He was one of the best. And Red OCTOBER. And, and, so many.
No mention of the Highlander? Shameful
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Rest in peace Mr Connery!!!
If you guys got a tux and a fake  pistol could be a cool costume
Namaste Sean! RIP. You followed your calling! And we were blessed by it!😪🙏💞
YOU THE MAN NOW, DOG
In other news, Her Majesty is expected to outlive her grandchildren. RIP Double O Seven. Her Majesty's Secret Service will miss you.
Lemme guess covid
You the man now, dawg!  Another great gone.
Why did they conveniently forget his best movie of all time: Zardoz?  The gun is good.
BEST BOND EVER!! RIP Sean Connery  💔
R.I.P James Bond.
He was and still is James Bond to me! May his soul rest in eternal peace. Today is a sad day..
Rip a legend
Don't forget Marney

RIP Sir Sean Connery, as the bag pipes declare your entry into eternity.
Bond, James Bond  007
RIP you legendary man. I’m heartbroken 😭😭😭😭
It’s SO eerie that the channel Nicki Swift JUST uploaded a video on Sean yesterday about why you don’t see him around anymore.  I bet she’s tripping out knowing she posted that and within hours he passed O__o
True legend and gorgeous man
My condolences to his family and loved ones. He will be sorely missed.
Best & only James Bond! He’ll be dearly missed. My condolences to his family.
Theatrical , but what do you say about 90 years old very impressive life well spent.. Rip ..cultural icon

Unique voice, talent , and down to earth guy..I’m bummed
RIP 007.
All the good actors are almost gone n we r left with hollywood political idiots who cant act to save their own lives. RIP SEAN YOU BE MISSED. THE ONLY 007
REST IN PEACE ❤
😣🙏🏿🙏🏿
There have been lots of movie action heroes in the last 100 years. Actors like Errol Flynn and Clint Eastwood have successfully played multiple characters in different periods, but it is Sean Connery as James Bond who is the greatest movie action hero ever.
My he rest in peace. I always admired him so greatly. Handsome, charming, brilliant of his art in acting. Mr. Universal! Wow 🤯. Nighted by the Queen? I'll miss him every day.
His "What are you prepared to do?" advice in The Untouchables stuck with me forever.
RIP
RIP Sean Connery.  ❣️ Thank you for all the awesome performances. You will live on forever.
No not my boy, he was the bond
Wish he made the League Of Extraordinary Men sequel he was cool as Quartermain ..... Godspeed sir RIP
He was to me and many others the only James Bond - 007. RIP
My friends and I were just talking about him last night. We wondered what happened to him after League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.
Wow it saddens me that Sean  has passed. I named my 6th child (Sean) after him. Always loved  watching any film he was in. I am really not a fan of James Bond flicks. However i watch the one's  he acted in. RIP Sean.
I’m 50 caught the tail end of this next statement but Sean Connery embodied the saying “When men were men.”..my favorite Bond movie Goldfinger...
Best Bond of all....so long 007
I hated hearing years ago that he was going to retire from acting. RIP
The Hill (1965) The wind and the Lion (1975) Indiana Jones and the last Crusade (1989) The First Knight (1995) Dragon Heart (1996)
Here's the thing; *He most likely didn't want to be remembered as James Bond.*
Well, I guess that's 2020 for ya.
release the kraken.
Goodbye Highland Swordmaster, you are beyond awesome.
I wake up and then sean is dead i was not a bond fan ween moore died so this is the first bond that died ween i was a bond fan i am sad                           RIP
Once again 2020 sucks.
What a great actor with that unforgettable voice. You'll be missed Sir Sean Connery
Covid19!
He will always be the best "Bond ".
A great man and actor he will be miss RIP Mr Bond😢
Sad
Most charismatic James Bond ever. Rest in peace.
2020 really bad the legend dies 😓😓😓 the best James Bond
My favorite James Bond. I also loved him in The Untouchables. RIP Sean.

Sean will always be the Man the myth and the Legend Double 007 and so much more R.I.P to Mr. Connery
great actor. will be missed. bond, james bond.
My favorite James Bond. My favorite line in The Untouchables by Sean Connery was the Lord hates a coward. Rest in peace 007.
Made Bond, James Bond, a household name! 😎🇺🇸🗽❤️
Sprayed Febreeze in my bathroom. Now it smells like shitrus 😞
I liked him but unfortunately I also found out that he was evil 😈 so
RIP LEGEND
What a sad day. RIP, Sean Connery.
Not all of the good die young. RIP our beloved 007.
So sad, but 90 is good.
THank you for all the great movies! RIP handsome
Thank you for all the wonderful films.
This guy made my last name awesome, he will be missed! What a legend..
Classy guy, Bless his soul.
Bond gold bond
A book hit me on the head this morning... I can only blame my shelf.  RIP the best 😞
what a life...R.I.P.
RIP to a legend thank you sir.
There can only be one! R.i.p.
Lusting after a guy they know just died. Pretty tasteless. And men would get fired for doing that to a woman.
The BEST JAMES BOND EVER! REST IN PEACE SEAN!
Wow that’s sad he was a awesome actor.
Rest In Peace Sir Connery. Aka 007
While I adore Sir Sean, I’m thankful COVID has eroded the public’s pedestal for celebrities.
No
You forgot about is role in Highlander.   Indeed, Sean will be missed.  God speed to you, Peacock; you will be missed.   :)
R.I.P Mr. Bond .
RIP Legend.
He will be surly miss by all may his departed soul rest in peace.
This is terribly sad news.  He was a beloved world famous talented actor and athlete . Also he was well remembered as the most famous actor who portrayed 007 James Bond in those James Bond movies in which I was honored to see free of charge back in the 1960's and early 1970's along with my brothers.
Now we know where we have to turn.....to the stars, Sean, to the stars....
There can be only one!!!
Oh noooo!  I know he was 90 but such a memorable career.
I so sad. I don't usually get upset when an actor passes. But this one was special. 😭
Rest in peace 🙏🙏
Just got finished watching Rising Sun! RIP Sean a true ICON!
RIP Sean Connery!
God speed 007
How can you can leave out his iconic role in The Rock
Damnit ... 2020 can knock it off already, can't take much more, rest in peace Sir Sean Connery, you will be missed .
The weirdest thing about Dr No was Ursula Andress's voice being dubbed !
2020 took so much from us.
Nobody gets outta here alive... he led a good life, and entertained millions.
🙏💔🙏 miss him already! Prayers and love to the Connery family
Damn you were a giant among the greats. I love & miss you dude. Thanks for all your great work.   ✌🏿 & ♥️
Most iconic actor in the world that spanned many different genres....rest in peace sir. Thoughts and prayers for the entire family.
I just thinking about him. I'm in tears 😭
RIP Sean Connery the best BOND and I loved Hunt for red October and especially Indiana Jones and The last crusade.  I am a huge Indiana Jones fan and last crusade is my fav movie because of Sean
My heart is broken.
R.I.P. Mr. Connery
Great man....and yes, best Bond indeed.
Its official, 2020 is the worst year ever!
🥺😪🥺😪😪😪
Goldfinger was my favorite Bond movie, he was a true classic!
James Bond never dies.
RIP.  A true gentleman.  Loved his role in The Rock.
RIP Mr. SEAN 007
Anyone else was getting that weird fast forward glitch on YouTube ?
RIP AND MAY GOD BE WITH YOUR FAMILY THROUGH THESE SAD TIMES.
Rest In Peace,  Always interesting , His Movies!   Condolences to his Family and Friends.
Sad day.
Hits really close to the heart. He will be missed. Loved the way he was portrayed with  harrison ford in Indiana Jones.
He will always be the one n only James Bond!  His sex appeal n quick wit were the most alluring his dark n gorgeous good looks. He exuded all this qualities.
I swear this was tribute was made well before his death. Put together very nice! RIP 007
Even tho this isn’t his line I always credited him for “ a shmoke and a pancake”
Let me guess... Cancer.....
He is one of the few celebrities that saddens me to hear of their passing
R.I.P Legend
Damn this year sucks.
Rip007
Oh he was one of my favorites!
He was the bast of the Bond Men. He was a very sexy man.
I was wondering a few days ago how he was doing.
Omg all the legends are dying. He was so great and authentic. But don't worry kids we still have billie eilish and lil something smfh lol. Just wow
Watching him on SNL just last night😣😢
😢💖😢💖😢
True national treasure and a Bond icon. Will be missed
We are discontented because we don’t know what to do with what is and being discontented with what is, we develop the idea of what should be. So our action then is based on an idea and the approximation to that idea is action and there is conflict between what is and should be.
90 is not a bad age to go it's a full life, I guess he took care of himself getting fit for his movie characters.
"We named the dog Indy" - Sean connery
coolest Bond and actor ever walk on earth... RIP.
Rest in peace Mr Bond
Rest his soul, he lived long.
It took naming off movies until Indiana Jones before my millennial co-worker knew who he was lol
God damn  loss of a legend right there
The part of life I hate so much ,rip
The only James Bond
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MAN/ SOUL!  Gut- wrenching!  Debonair.......irreplacable/ non-duplicable!  Mercy!  Cry, girl
Rip Sean Connery 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I liked him in the movie Alcatraz
“Death: An Inside Story  Death is a taboo in most societies in the world. But what if we have got this completely wrong? What if death was not a catastrophe that it is made to be, but an essential aspect of life, rife with spiritual possibilities for transcendence? For the first time, someone is saying just that.  In this unique treatise-like exposition, Sadhguru dwells extensively upon his inner experience as he expounds the more profound aspects of death that are rarely spoken about. From a practical standpoint, he elaborates on what preparations one can make for one’s death, how best we can assist someone who is dying and how we can continue to support their journey even after death.  Whether a believer or a disbeliever, a devotee or an agnostic, an accomplished seeker or a simpleton, this is truly a book for all those who shall die!”  https://www.ishalife.com/usa/death-an-inside-story
Looked up the other day he was enjoying his retirement in the Bahamas. Lived a long full life. Thank you Sean Connery.
I had just told my brother yesterday, that Mr. Connery just keeps getting better over the years. God Bless this man.
*My very first crush...* 💔😢💔
He'll be beating women up in heaven.
Though I grew up with Pierce Brosnan, RIP the original 007. At least he lived a full life. May he rest in peace in Heaven.
Icon and my favorite Bond
What makes this a little bit harder for those in the UK  is Sean Connery is the 4th person famous in the UK to die in the last 4 days
Damn that really sucks. I really thought the man was immortal.
God bless his family.
🇺🇸Gooo Joe Goooooo, thanks🇺🇸
Perhaps a sacrificial death to Satan on Halloween? Idk just a thought.
Nooooooo!!! 🤬 2020
R.I.P. love the Bond movies.
"Shaken not stirred" RIP 🙏🏾
You only live twice Mr bond
THE BEST JAMES BOND OF ALL TIME!
https://youtu.be/h3UNkM8PTt0 Attention BLM. Please copy and share ASAP! You must watch.
He was my man...I will miss him dearly I'm in tears.
And to wake up to this :/
He was always the best James Bond in my opinion Rest In Peace
Easily the coolest Bond ... no-one else came close. Rest in peace.
Although not as big as the Bond Series, let's not forget him as Allen Quartermain in.......The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen....Blessing to His Family may he Rest In The Arms of God.
There will never be another actor like Sean Connery
"Shaken, not stirred" RIP Mr. Connery.
Sir Connery will be greatly missed by us all. A great actor in my eyes. Rest in peace, good sir.
Oh man. This is very sad news. Sean Connery was one of the very best actors, he played some of the very best characters imaginable. He was a consummate gentleman, he will be forever known as a true Scotsman. I used to wait with anticipation the release of his next movie, because his roles were always full of life and drama, and some comedy thrown in besides.   Rest well Sir Connery, you have entertained us for so long. Your legacy remains, in our hearts and minds,  as strong today as it was so long ago. I tender my sincerest condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Sean Connery, Knight of the Realm, who was a great man, a father, a grandfather, and a great friend to so many. You will remain in our hearts and minds forever.
Thank you for everything Sean. One of the greatest actors to grace our lives with his gift and mastery acting. Your legacy will resonate in our hearts and memories forever. Thank you again. May your beautiful soul rest in eternal peace
WILL BE A TRUE LEGAND FOR ALL TIME !! R.I.P.
The coolest dude has left the planet.
Not even Bond survived 2020...Ay, caramba.
He was by far, the best James Bond. He made spying cool.
Very sad news.
Breaks my heart. He was a tremendous actor and the absolute best James Bond. Rest in peace Sean.💔

Thanks 2020.. Way to viciously kick us all when we're already down.
died*, passed*
RIP
A great actor, I always enjoyed his movies though I did think Roger Moore was a better James Bond because of the humor he brought to the role.
:(
Dammit, he didnt get to see Trump win a second time!
A great actor and the best Bond.
Oh, that's sad news. :(
RIP SIR SEAN CONNERY AKA 007

Thank you for all your contributions to the arts and so many other things! You will truly be missed always! Love you and God bless!!! ♥️💐😘 #AScottsman #SeanConnery 💐💐
😢RIP
R.i.p to the best james bond ever!
Just shocked, just can't imagine what he passed from?  He was sooooo healthy and just in excellent tip-top shape all the time.  I was hoping he'd do a cameo or some role in a James Bond movie and now this?? what the heck, I'm so shaken.  I won't get over this for some time.  He always interviewed so well recently and was doing exercises all the time.
What a throwback to old school masculinity. I loved watching James Bond movies with my dad as a kid. He will be sorely missed.
Back when men were real men
#SeanConnery The greatest Scottsman, Actor, and Knight ever to grace this planet. I am so honored to have been named after this Legend.  #RestInPeace #GreatestBondEver #DragonHeart #TrulyExtraordinaryGentleman
