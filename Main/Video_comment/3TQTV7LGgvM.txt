Puerto Rico schooled em’ in some of the plays. 💯♥️🇵🇷
first time the nba mentions our island
le dieron como papa borracho a los puertorriqueños
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
PORQUE TODO EL MUNDO SE LO MAMA A LOS NORTEAMERICANOS? PREGUNTA SERIA! 😊
Remember when Puerto Rico won against USA in 2004💀
When a usa territory goes up against the USA
Puerto Rico next to changes the zone
Love to see this  it's vers nice
Great game, and players 😊
USA VS USA
I didn't know Puerto Rico has a team. I thought they are included as the US team.
The mighty USA waiting for their game to Spain
workover
WTG U.S.A.!
As a Rican I'm not proud of team Puerto Rico 🇵🇷, they look like a bunch of players who didn't make team USA...I'm disgusted!!!! Where are the to actual Boricuas....pal carajo con este equipo.
so nice to watch this 2023 us dt bcause  they are very talented and too humble making joyous the heart of the Almighty God which provides victory per Proverbs 21,:31 The horse is made ready for the day of battle; but victory rests with the Lord."
AR15 your the best young lakers team go idol make some noice...🙂🙂🙂

Ingramm
Mukang mahihirapan tayo sa kanila pang NBA na galawan
All the people talking shit usa going to lose lol... Where ya at now? Keep that same energy. This roster was made to handle the physical style of play. Good defense and unselfish players. To all the haters begging for Bron and kd and Steph, bruh those guys don't want to deal with the physical play style because they more worried about the nba season.
Why can't watch full match?
Jose Alvarado is great Puerto Rican NBA player

USA what a team❤
why lebron is not in USA team? 😂😂😂
I love basketball 🏀❤
😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
UNSELFISH BASKETBALL, BALL MOVEMENT, AMAZING TEAM USA🇺🇸✌️🎉
Massacre by 🇺🇸😆Team USA to Victim 🇵🇷😭Team Puerto Rico
fell asleep
PR is part of America. Doesn't America own PR.? This is racist
A Puerto Rican team with barely any Puerto Rican. Give me a break! Hard to root for PR when most  players are not from the island. PR always had 2 or 3 American players, but now it is ridiculous. The days of Fico, Piculing, Edgar Leon,  Ramon Rivas, Quijote, Mincy, etc. are long gone. Mincy was American, but at least he played in PR for many years, and was loved by the fans.
Congratulations USA 👏🤍💕 🇵🇭
One reason I know dude is the greatest, is because fans, at large, gotta tell blatant lies about this dudes career to knock him. Always an excuse when he comes out on top.
This game has more dunks than all wnba games combined for the last 20 years.
Ref didn't call travel 1:38. The player was right in front of him. 🙄
Team USA without the  " EGO " laden self proclaimed superstar players !
this is actually a pretty good team ngl
excellent defense by usa team ...
Anyone else think it is ironic that Puerto Rico is versing The US but it is part of The US?
Happy how USA looks
Right off the top, somebody tell Reaves to get a serious grip/ He thinks he has to do something "pistol-peteish" every damn play/!Glue guy gone wild & his defense suffers because of it/ Josh Hart is a walking tirnover/ Gotta Go/ Brandon Ingram is out of shape\ This isn't his type of game/ no shooters as usual/ Where is the full-court D/ ok enough for now/ better learn from the woman's soccer team/
Brunson is great, but Haliburton is just way better honestly
Waters is nasty!
this USA players are too good . they must play in the NBA ✌🏼🤣
Full of YOUNG Talent!!!👍👍😮😮❤❤
I was under the assumption that this game was supposed to be played under the FIBA rules. Or does the 3 second rule in the restricted area no longer exist?
Porto-rico 51is so talented
They gonn have a record of steps calls
Steve Kerr coaching underrated
Phoenix will regret trading cam and bridges for durant. Durant is an  all time big talent. One of the best players to ever step on a basketball court. But hes getting up there in age. And those two in Brooklyn will only get better. I thought cam was just a shooter. It looks as though he does a lot of thing pretty well. And i didnt know he was that long/tall. I thought he was like 6'7. He looks dam near like a slim 6'9- 6'10. He stood just as tall as paolo banchero in one photoshoot i saw. And banchero is every bit of 6'10.
That sucks that Puerto Rico lost
This USA team plays more like a team than recent olympic squads.  PR is no slouch and should have a decent tournament.
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
haliburton plays great, unselfish push the ball run the floor
Tremont waters should get a chance In the league again his game is more polished now would be a solid backup scoring PG for a team.
I love our defense and tenacity 💪
U.s team is bs wow
How PR have a team when they are in the USA that’s like USA vs Florida…
Full pack already idol. Hope mine too. Thank you.
It sucks that this team got no Stephen curry and lebron just imagine
How does PR hqve their own team if they are a US territory
I wasn’t a believer but good defense good tempo the gap is still there
Bro reeves is a HOOPER
Edwards is going to lead team usa to gold one day
And lebron and the big stars lost to this country some years ago😮😂
I wonder if fans from other countries know none of these dudes are our superstars   I just want out superstars to come one time and blow out everyone by 50 a game
Isn’t Pueto Rico in USA? 😀😀😀
U.S.A the best basketball league around the world…
Puerto Rico is the US, though. This is weird.
that austin reaves hesi pull up was smooth 🔥
Nast shot..
Is puerto rico guys. Chill. When you beat Argentina, Serbia, France, Spain, then we talk.
USA crushed PR in pieces as they warm up for upcoming matches.
😂😂 cette équipe des USA🇺🇲 vont tués les équipes en coupe du monde 🏀🤧
good team but still not enough against european teams. This is FIBA world cup ya'll
Doesnt even make sense anymore.  Most of these guys arent even Puerto Rican.  Just a bunch of guys that couldnt make any other team so they went for the easy roster spot.
Two strong USA teams.
Better defense then I thought they were gonna have 👀🔥
❤🎉❤
Walker kessler didn’t play actual mins is crazy 😭
1:38 Travel
Looks like young ANT may be the goto guy on this USA squad.
Dude on the thumbnail look like a slow Andre Ward
Team USA played great its so much talent on that team 🏅
🇺🇸
Waiting USA vs FRANCE😎💪
USA
Nba players is the most powerful players all over the world 💪
Good win, but 🇵🇷 all day....
5.41 who touched him? thats not the and one
Ups
WTH, Where is the Diversity/Inclusion? I don't see no Mexicans, no Asians, no Indians, no trannies. Hypocrites, all talk...except where they have the advantage! 😂
This Team USA is gonna be a problem I mean wow they just crushed them in the 2nd half 😯😦
Its like a really nice collection of young stars. No real big names except for brunson, edwards, jackson & ingram.
I was wondering when they were gonna start playing. 2nd half they actually put shoes on
White boy shooter on the USA squad?? Its over
I swear, whats the point of watching this lol. This is pointless.
Look at all the “I no Black” players on the PR team. Self hate… SMH…
What a beautiful team
https://youtu.be/UCzPg1KusGw
Bridges,  Edward, Ingram will be Super Stars
But can they beat Denver?
Puerto Rico gave up at 61 points
USA vs USA
I’m looking for nick mendez on the Puerto Rico national team 😭💯
Look at Austin Reeve's arms.  He's slowly turning black right before our eyes 😂
Ain’t Puerto Rico part of the us I’m confused lol
Brandon Ingram got bigger
1st half got me worried, thought it would be another Carlos Arroyo situation lol. But they turned it around and dominated in the second half
Puerto Rico got no defense
Maaan that is Jordan son
It’s too easy 🤣🤣🤣 ain’t nobody fucking with USA basketball we really them on this side
A triple coaching staff of Kerr, Spoelstra, and Lu makes this squad dangerous as hell.
Man that is some beautiful basketball
Can’t wait to see them play some good euro teams
All young blood with full of energy and no stars = unselfish.
Is that Chicago’s own, Adam Amin on the call?
The sophomore class of USA Basketball.
Wow, this is the 8th best team USA could come up with and still packed these guys out by 40+.  Imagine if Bron and crew we’re participating, fuggettaabbouutit
Go usa
If you pay close attention ... USA players travel a lot
When team USA sees a real center, they gonna get crushed
#28 traveled
KD&DG🔥
People trash this team a lot but they’re actually playing like a team, I think they’re gonna surprise a lot of people
Need to see Canada vs USA
Represent Indy hali🫡
This was wild, glad i got to see it 🕳️🤾🏾‍♂️💯
dude the Banchero block at 6:20 was and  is absolutely disrespectful! damn
Chemistry 💯
dam i didnt expect this game to be this exciting ! great basketball from both clubs Well done fellas
USA is up 32 points in the commentator says very competitive game. WTF 😒
Nice seeing the young players running up and down the court like the Showtime lakers.  I hope to see something like this from my Spurs in the next few seasons.
Everyone joked bout this squad but these are the future. They got fresh legs to run the floor and playin wit effort. Chemistry looks good and they all trust the man next to them cuz they all proven stars. Great squad selected no egos either.
team USA in this match like college grad doing Alphabet practice questions in preparation for board exam
People dont realize that all these young players on this team are about to have a breakout season this year and this team is lowkey stacked
getting pumped for the season to start
Good to see Team USA take some good-advised mid-range shots and easy lay-ups instead of chucking up threes (though they had their fair share of those as well, unfortunately). That's the way to go on offense!
Hyyy
Tremont waiters belong in the NBA
Moins de stars mais au final un joli jeu: team USA fait bien partie des favoris, avec la Serbie, la Slovénie, la Grèce, l'Espagne, la France, etc ... Une belle coupe du monde en perspective ! Allez les bleus 🇨🇵💙🤍❤️👍
Austin Reaves Steve Nash 2.0
Brandon Ingram looks just like KD from a distance
Nice pick for the team usa, well balanced
College basketball team usa 😂😂😂😂...
Usa Gran equipo y juegan en equipo y rapidos buena altura este equipo, se nota el trabajo del tecnico, usa campeon Saludos desde pansma💯🇵🇦🇵🇦
equipo de Puerto Rico
アメリカやっぱつぇぇえw
I was sure that is KD, but its Ingram with number 7 lmao
Ja morant 😢was here the score would been blow out💯 I wish he had his act together smh 🤦🏽‍♂️ we need ja
These guys might not be the big names that the team USA usually showcasing, but these group played defense tremendously.
why the thumbnail look like a 2k cover
Tam buena primera mitad en la segunda la cagamos
Kept thinking Ingram was KD with the 7 on
There a young time better be running up and down that court
I had doubts about this team but I'm impressed how they played together against Puerto Rico 👏
Keep this 🤬 going!!
strongest TEAM USA ever 🙌💯
Slovenia is gonna beat us and luka is gonna have like 45 lol
usa1   vs  usa5
why is kd n draymond jus sitting on the sideline what happened to USA basketball sh*t is a privilege to represent through basketball
Boa tarde congrats vai amén bom trabalho
Tremont ✨
Fack nba bro that is shit😂😂
bridges is nice
PR bringing the sazon!!!
Great teamwork from a young USA team who hasn’t had much practice together. This team is hungry, they’re only going to get better.
Austin's auntie was screeming like she was scared
Bugbog sarado ang gilas dito haha
puerto rico > usa
Yo y’all see ingram gain some weight 😳🔥
Chill with the commercials please
I deadass thought Mikal was KD for like 3 seconds.
USA = SHIT
Always good game when everybody is shooting up 3s.
People are sleeping on this team they got a nice mix of players
Mal momento pa sel de poltorro
I've seen this kind of scenario before. European teams are the real threat in world cup for many years have past. Now canada has some solid team to match them aswell.
Bring home the gold guys! I believe in y’all ️. Very proud of my team Puerto Rico.
where is the players stare  in ibn of usa
Bumalik na Ang dating USA Yung tipong tumatambak ng kalaban😊💪🔥
Who’s gonna tell them Puerto Rico is part of the USA? 🤔
Ingram is looking promising playing PF looks like he put on more muscle too
If only Puerto Rico maintained their stamina and energy I think they can beat USA in this game.
How many ads for a 10 min video? Fuck you nba

peurto rico dog shit
Jace Carson vs Nick Mendez💀
51 from Puerto Rico is pure handle, speed, and vision. An old school point guard
3:12 a traveling bruh 😂
Ingram Ant JJ Brunson Bridges started?
Them playing against PR is like if the US Team was playing Wyoming All State Team its bonkers
Good game, both usa and puerto rico is strong team, the teamwork deserve respect.
NBA in good hands… lots of young stars fun to watch. Love each players game
Last time I checked Puerto Rico was part of the United States. So it’s like the USA against New Mexico?
Dude im so slow, i thought Ingram was Durant for half of these highlights.
When is the next game
Team usa🎉🎉🎉
isnt puerto rice apart of america what da hell
Great win! Excited to see them get tested
Lost by 43pts
Great win for the 🇺🇸, but they have some good time to learn the fiba rules because PR is not that strong but still you have to show respect to PR anyways will see how they play in the tournoment ....
Often times Tyrese's affect on the game can be overlooked on the stat sheet. I think he did an amazing job setting up his teammates for success the entire game and brings a refreshing passion to team USA.
Just imagine if USA played their best players! It’s reason USA has the most gold medals 🇺🇸
Gold
_ 43 POINT 😂😢😅😅😅😅
Where the super stars at??
9:16 crazy assist by kessler
Knew that was legendary Bill Raftery and Great bulls announcer. Just based on their voices and then watched tv version, it was indeed them
ingram looking like kd
Puerto Rico national team, the Philippines and Cambodia of South America.. TOO MANY AMERICAN PLAYERS in their National Team.. 🤦‍♂️🤣🤦‍♂️
them mfs aint puerto rican 😂😂😂
damn USA ain’t got 1 superstar
Where’s Zion?
Jackson jr and Edwards are beasts! Great job guys
That boy Austin Powers HOOPIN‼️😂🔥
ingram looks like melo
This is all Steves Kerr brain
😅sksksks
these guys are going against nba players
Ant is magic
I miss the NBA! 😭 Can't wait for this season.
Puerto Rican is part of the US. What is going on here?! 😂😂
Trying to tell y'all Edwards is going to be like Michael Jordan
Ant came from nothing Sw4ts legendary...let them know ...swear 💯
These games are crazy 💀
I am convinced this nó the weakest IS team of all time
Austin Reaves the best American born white boy in the league. If he was tatted up like birdman he would make a killing in endorsements
Good three-pointers
This is not some random collection of stars and future stars. You can just tell by the second chance effort, defensive switching, rebounding and balanced box score. This is a TEAM. Great to see and hope this culture continues. US Basketball needs it
Who's sexy abuela was that clapping
AR15 💗
I love this team I like the pieces and figuring out there identify athleticism alone should be too much for the world and team chemistry
Tremendo potencial en P R
NBA third team
No he just didn't say go to them N words
Crocodile nearly attacked players outside the arena https://youtube.com/shorts/G542FCaWKV8?feature=share
Brandon Ingram looking real brolly out there 💪🏾
Really liking this squad.  Coaching staff is fire, probably why team held so nicely
Imagine if zion was healthy we would have no worries.  Team canada a problem for the next 8 years.
Smoked ‘em 😂😂
Be nice ro see them against spain greece argentina lithuania etc etc all those big dogs in europe
I hope Team USA keeps this up.
EphraimItes were ballin!!!!
How about banchero not playing on his country😂😂😂😂
Game was smoother than a rocket vs spurs game. Wasn’t fast paced with people just chucking up shots
Why the fck is that little goofy yt boy on that team??? Desmond Bane would've been a way better pick up
Guys who been working on this game…..  Cam Johnson  Paolo  Ingram  Bridges  Reaves  I’ve seen them all attack different ways that they haven’t in the past these guys gonna show out this year 💯
carry at 1:37 is crazyyy
im only here for AR
USA
https://youtu.be/RCedC4dHKNA
1:38 If you like traveling, this game's for you.
As a Puerto Rican this was fun to watch. Good game!
PR is always a good litmus test 👍
So Puerto Rico is not a state of America?  I'm confused . Why is there an state  America playing against its country?
travel in 6:33
nba role players in the USA basketball team, that's odd.
Team USA plays defensively but still you can see that they dont push their limit becoz their nba teams expecting them to return withour injuries, I think if they play without restrictions they can win and get x2 lead.
I don't know any of them, but guess the nba took a knee and i stop witching them how ever many years ago that was. I do know the pacers player only because I'm from indy and went to 2 games last year with the fam
Austin Reaves’ confidence is through the roof! Great to see it!
Who is deez Nggas 🤔
This is gonna be a fun USA team!
reaves... bang...👏👏👏👏
My boys was no match 🇵🇷😂
W
Where is Alferado?
Eua vs su Colonia 😂😂😂
😂😂😂 2 minutes in first clip of the white guy…instant corner 3 😭😭😭
Dont get injured jaren, memphis needs you.
🇵🇷💪
Is it me or ingram looks bigger
That’s about 10 turnovers
🔺Eye wonder why black athletes always represent these counties that are “SUPPOSEDLY” majority White/Caucasian?🔺 Eye have noticed this while watching international sporting(mainly track& field and Basketball)🔺👁
that call on brunson when the guy got that put back has me rolling lmao hes like WTF? and me too lol 5:41
PHILIPPINES VS PUERTO RICO 😊😊
Like this tea. Gold in future
Go USA!
Not sure this team wins it all
Tyrese moves like Jordan Poole, I thought it was Jordan for a second 😶
Jaren Jackson is a beast
I didn’t think USA was that good because they r so young
💪
i like the hustle.. i'll keep watchin.
Yo is that Reaves mother 😂
Everyone that was hating on this roster is definitely about to get proven wrong
Love Kerr but Spo should be coaching
Still the weakest US team ever assembled 😂
Bro on the left look like a created character 😂
Triple J really that guy
Paolo needs to start Ik he’s young ash but you can’t sit here and tell me Bridges is better than him
Playing defense wins games
Worst team they ever put together
🇵🇷 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
ESO ESTA bien para que no se crea PR que estan a El nivel.
This team about to play like that one school in the suburbs that always beats the inner city teams..
Ingram has really bulked up since he been a pro.
They looked good. 👍
1:36 that's clearly a travel
That Water dude is a really good player.
Nobody is better than the USA at basketball, Football or baseball . We created those sports, you can beat us . Love PR though
usa for lose it looks like yoda say.
Puerto Rico is the US
Is that waters from lsu ?
They must have different dribble rules. At 1:38 dude ran from the E on the court and didn't dribble again until he got to the free-throw line.😂
Easy Take:Jackson’s blocks will be impactful
nah i love this group of guys
No match
✊🏾🇺🇸🏀⛹🏾💪🏾
Austin Reaves going undrafted was a blessing for the Lakers
USA proving they own PR, in basketball, and literally
To many ads
If we're going to play against Puerto Rico like they're an independent country we might as well release them from the opressional  handcuffs of united states slavery.
Austin reeves is the next Kobe
Can someone explain why it's the younger dudes on team usa? Why isn't it lebron etc
Go Gilas Pilipinas, wag na kayo sumali sa FIBA plrase lang sayang lang hahaha
4:56 that swish sound was heavenly
Im just here for Cade
my computer quality was so bad i thought ingram was kd😂
Why when I saw this I said pueutro Rico got there ass kicked then watched this and was like yeah 😂😭
2:40 he aint wearing 23 for no reason 🔥
The got jordan back for this
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
Spain, Serbia, Greece, Argentina & Slovenia are the biggest threats to these young USA team.
Can we get these announcers for NBA games, please!
Hold on…isn’t this just USA vs USA? I know PR is an incorporated commonwealth territory of the United States..but we change the goal post as we see fit? In some instance, this is USA and not the case in other situations…and no representation in congress…this is all ..whatever at this point!! Next up…USA vs Guam followed by USA vs Hawaii…stay tuned!!
Portis sucks.
Is Stephen Thompson the son of the former Syracuse Player
I thought BI was Durant for the first 5 mins. His build and at times his game are eerily similar. Great to have someone like that especially because KD is probably the best US player ever.
I actually really really like this team
6:00-6:02 Kd and Draymond sitting next to each other court-side site to see
Mejores Polateros
Not to brag but….We are the best in the world. Team USA !
The best players are not even playing 😂
I can see them running the Golden State offense wild Erik Spoelstra of the Miami Heat will do the defense perfect combination of coaching. The US men's team has some thoroughbreds as far as athletes. It'll be interesting see how they do.
So they PR when they dribbling the ball for y'all huh, funny thing is, wonder if they identify as black.....
this is what i want for the nba, day in and day out..i wonder will we get it this year. i hope the tournament turns up the intensity and it carries all star break.
Everyone is talking about how this USA team is dAnGeRoUs yet a tiny island kept up with them the entire first half...
Really incredible game by team USA!! Also no one is selfish they all play together. The Love is real!! 💯💯🙌🙌
👍
3:29 should have been and one for the Porto rican dude
Wait, is Puerto Rico not part of the USA anymore?
Tremont Waters is NBA!!!!!!!
Puerto Rico has black players?
Que bueno son muy creidos los boris
목사님. 푸에르토리코 미국땅 아니랍니다
I had no experience of playing basketball but being a basketball fan has really helped to shape my life. Back in 2013 I meet a lady who changed my life financially through online trading and investment where I achieve 4 out of 5 goals in life
I’m hoping Kessler will get better minutes against teams that are more paint dominant. Hoping he can show off his defense abilities with USA
I wish the NBA was this intense Every player is giving it 100%
Second half they definitely found stride hopefully good things to comw from this group
Hope the NBA gives Waters another chance
Lemah banget. Harusnya USA uji coba lawan tim berat kayak Indonesia. Juara SEA Games 2021 mas
Yikes
Now why we don’t see this nice layup combinations in NBA ???
I love the highlights that the NBA channel puts up.
If this da squad...bronze metal at best
How would Pablo be on team USA? Why wouldn’t he be on mexico or some that’s fun doe
I had to be reminded that NBA Players are just SO MUCH BIGGER AND FASTER than the rest of the world. It's crazy how freakish these guys are.
Damn team USA looking sad out there they gotta work on pace & space if they think about doing anything this year
What a dream temam..
Prolly the worst USA team in a LONG LONG time. The world gonna be catching up very very soon
I love this playmaking effort out of BI. Hopefully brings some of this energy to New Orleans
I'll never get tired of haliburton's passes
Definitely didn't need Trae Young after seeing this game.
michael Jordan is unstoppable
Love how Reaves play, so proud
THE lady screaming made me mute this video omfg !!
The other team had no height advantage what so ever.
US vs PR has always felt like what if all the states jumped one territory
JJJ🎉
USA all day everyday🎉🎉   Puerto Rico stick to reggeatón, y'all suck at basketball.
That boy 🐜 man a beast!!
When tf Protis get on team USA 🤣 that’s tough
why no lamelo ball
Tremont Waters
This is a trash usa team no superstars at all
This U.S. team has tremendous energy and are very unselfish. Love to see this!
💯💪❤️🇵🇷🇵🇷
This is good...the camera should pan out...though!!...lol
Ingram moving like KD out there
🎉🎉🎉
Wow so much energy and upbeat tempo! Refreshing to see a new generation of players stepping up to represent our country 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 go team USA!!!!!
The fact that the U.S.A. got so much disrespect before they even played a game blows my mind
Weird to me that they would pit the US against one of it's own territories.
It’s all fun and games until the bench comes in for these other teams😂 our entire bench is still NBA guys, their benches are probably not professional players
Is this game played under the NBA rules or FIBA rules?
Looking good! Give Walker Kessler some of Bobby portis’s minutes next time though
This doesn’t make any sense playing against your country wtf 😂😂
Where can I watch these games live?!
HILARIOUS 👉Romero 2 travels in one possession at 3:11.  The ball hit the ground “ONCE”
Australia will beat USA
Неплохая вроде команда
Is this a tournament?  How were players chosen?   These are ALL NBA players???
look at the team 1992 and this team, big big difference
This bouta be GOLDEN STATE on Steroids #USABASKETBALL #USTHEGOLD #TEAM24 #MAMBATALK24
Wow.
1:38 uncalled travel
Zion "FatBoy" Williamson and Ja "GunSlinger" Morant should've been the leaders of this team. But I'm still positive they'd win gold!
This team usa are gonna be fun to watch and they gonna win 🏆 gold because they are unselfish and play hard on defense. Yes they dont have the mega star to get em a bucket when is a close game but i think they gonna be fine
You really can't let team USA get their rhythm or it's over 🤨
Baya Boriqua!!!...🇵🇷
I had flashbacks when Ingram missed that 3 at 1:18 in the second quarter 💀
Bckzk8d2dgkg8ne8sjrid2kssi2s82jrr🎉🎉
Ydhzhrh
If Tremont Waters was a few inches taller he would easily be an all star
This USA team is playing like an actual team. They’re dangerous.
Yeah this is a good team they picked players who are unselfish and play defense run the floor and you have really good playmakers who take care of the ball USA finally getting it we don’t need to just pack our team with the best talent but actually build a really good roster instead
This usa players have great chemistry.
that vision 3:39 is insane
canada is waiving
hey guys getting raped literally biologically takes away your mental ability to ask people questions
I’m sorry I see some MJ in Ant. Dude is about to surprise people on with good he is.
Puerto rico is property of the US why are they represented as independent in the Olympics is beyond me
That Waters looks pretty good.
Dawwwwwm im from PR but that its a hell of a team and for the first time is not about the stars from the nba is not like a dream team assembled its a bunch of young legs with good iQ
REPENT ANE BE READY GOD BLESS
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👍👍
Boring ! no teamwork, all ballhogs
This team is missing lonzo ball😭
i wanted to see Ja Morant in the team , help him to recover and clear his mind.
As a Laker's fan i like Austin Reaves he just gotta work on his defense that's really it
Man there’s all kinds of Puerto Ricans on their team! Lol
Too Strong, Too Gud. 👏👏👏
How tf do you lose to team USA?
Team USA has a bunch of bench players… 8-10min a game players.. not cool
This two teams wont won against Senegal if thats what they only got,i bet this teams caliber wont even be entering the semis
这波多黎各能把中国打爆吧
the team can switch 1 through 5 on defense and not have a mismatch that the other team can take advantage which is just filthy also on of they just might do something we have yet to really se which would be to run 5 out motion with princeton principals that would be super because JJJ is a 40%+ 3 point shooter in the league they could have him at the three point line that would leave the lane wide open forever
Where's Jose Alvarado
Tyrese should start.
i thought that was KD
Mane who AE barber 😂😂
I gotta say, Brandon Ingram is REALLY trying to be the next Kevin Durant wearing #7.
This team will loose against France, Spain and Greece
i see team chemistry from team USA, credits to steve kerr
Did you know that Puerto Rico once defeated the United States basketball team in the 2004 Summer Olympics? Puerto Rico's victory over the heavily favored USA team marked one of the biggest upsets in Olympic basketball history.

1:37 😂😂😂
Sports are for minorities 💩
You can earn any rewards in this life but you can not bribe God into heaven, you must repent of your sins and trust in Jesus Christ or hell awaits
i love this team! Super cohesive unit. Ball movement and unselfish plays!
Go USA! 👊🤜🤛🏀
Ngl from a far mikal Bridges Be lookin like Dame 👀
Feels like this US team is still a Team B to a US line up. They're gonna fail in FIBA.
Spain will beat you.  Viva Espana!
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life 🙏🏼❤✝️😊
I thought Puerto Rico was a U.S. territory.
i respect the energy and unselfishness but i still cant believe this is the best the united states went with. i miss the 90s and 2000s teams so damn much. this is embarassing
hows it puerto rico vs usa if usa owns those little islands over there😂😂😂
Reeves is worth every penny glad the lakeshow kept him
Paolo big as hell
why at the end haliburton looked tight when paolo took it to the rim instead baseline instead of swinging it 😂😂
Anthony Edwards is a dog and we will not lose
https://youtube.com/@JoshDay-dr4zp?si=ioyfuoyDsBOEbaQ5
It must be nice for team USA to beat team USA...
Looks like the rec 😂😂
It’s crazy nba doesn’t accept Puerto Rico as USA
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

is it just me or does it look like ingram changed his shot up a little?
Great job Team USA. May God continue to bless every player and coach. Amen.
Nice suppose to win victory for Team USA. Lets see how they do this year
Mikal, Ant Edwards , & Tyrese Haliburton are going to be the main stars for this team
Let’s go 2024 Olympics
Yessssssirrr Team USA💯💯this is great group we got very fun to watch
Im happy Steve Kerr is leading Team USA
Bring back the redeem team. Best team USA has ever been by a mile
I don't like basketball at all . But my point of view is this, Puerto Rico is not a state of the USA , but if Puerto Rican person is born in the island still a US citizen . wether that person like or not ? Puerto Rico depends on the USA for everything. So this reason a lone they should not play against the country they depend on
I see u waters from New Haven Brodie
Austin Reaves 3rd year breakout gonna hit like crack in the 80s 😭
Luka is stopping this momentum
Puerto Rico 🇵🇷  ALL Day but shouts to USA 🇺🇸  great team .
Boricuas 🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷💪🏼 we don’t quit . Punetta
Philippines will beat them
They should have just sent the whole GSW team than this team 😂😂😂
Australia or France will tear em apart in the Finals   Team are all Bust
looking good out there fellas!
Bunch of folks on here were probably clowning them before this game. Told y'all, team USA is still on top.
I am once again asking, where can we see these games and when?????
USA has no competition
24.5 (2.24) 1 / 186.5 over :))
USA team is deep. And long
Very unselfish side. No stat padding. They will be a threat🇺🇸
This team seems to have good chemistry.
I wanna see how Canada team is doing. The rosters are insane.
Wish Kobe coulda met Reaves , would definitely love him
https://youtube.com/shorts/8xHipDDtP7E?feature=share
They still not winning any gold
Hey guys getting raped literally biologically takes away your ability to complain. Please relay this information to everyone on earth I think we can stop AIDS and go to Avatar mode or something. Also I think when you die you just get absorbed by the fungus network under the earth [[ (Mushroom Kingdom :) ]] and get reborn as another baby somewhere or whatever
US is gonna have a ball team thats all 7 ft and taller soon.
Wait so who was the foul called on at 5:40? because that whistle made no type of sense lol
épico
If Puerto Rico is a territory how can they face off against their own country 😂
The USA has 100x the population of Puerto Rico. Great showing by them though.
I’ve been saying it for the past two years! Puerto Rico and their BSN garbage league is trash!!! 😂 bunch of retired or wanna be NBA players in the island that are worthless in the NBA or Overseas. Enough said. I’m glad they exposed them.
It's rare and nice to see USA players NOT jacking up 3's everytime down the court. Making your opponents cover all 5 guys instead letting them rest on defense because of the 3 point offense is where it's at.
Tyrese won’t be on the bench for much longer…
Every player on this team is considerably better than Austin Reeves. He doesn’t belong on the roster over Trae Young.
Gg to my puerto rican 🇵🇷  and 🇺🇸 it was a great game
I like that they immediately fed Jaren Jackson Jr. on offense. They need to keep him happy because he's the answer for them. They don't have a real center. They don't have a lot of elite defenders — especially on the front line. He's their guy.
I missed basketball 😢
No matter what we are still the standard ☝🏾
ANTHONY EDWARDS.
Why did both of my countries had to go head to head bro
Team USA started out real slow but as those young guys got comfortable, they started getting real dangerous. Watch this group all group up before our eyes in this tournament. They all play well together and play great defense.
Good game, and effort Puerto Rico. Considering the island is only 100 miles by 35 miles in size, you truly fought like David vs Goliah.  Great job guys!
Started off slow. The team is young and not selfish. Good ball movement among everyone. And everyone played DEFENSE!!!  they hustled
France, the 🥈 from Tokyo, automatically qualifies for next year's Olympic tournament.
Steve Kerr is just happy to have some size on the team for a change
Basketball is just better when the two-step rule is enforced.
Not bad for our B team. Imagine if it was our Olympic team 😂
Ingram looking like kid with the 7
Puerto Rico got smoked😂😂😂😂😂
Next generation
Jaren Jackson deserves more recognition
92 Dream team faced scubs lmao
I’m all for team USA but if I see Waters, I’ve gotta support him. At like, 5’10 he’s what I want to see succeed.
Nice team USA playing together
💜💛 AR15
Tyrese Halliburton shoot like a wnba player lmao
This time is cold
There were a lot of doubters until they watched the highlights. Good job USA
Yesssa pass the ball play defense get in the lanes thats winning hoops USA USA USA USA USA USA
Where is lebron and curry and greak freak??
Banchero gonna leave a lasting mark during Olympics, he's so solid.
They need melo!!!
Kessler being the odd man out in the center rotation is highly criminal.
this how you gauge the caliber of US basketball, teams in asia and other european teams been preparing for months, USA team scrimmage for like 3 days lol, and look at this. their scrimmages even look ordinary. but france is a threat, im pretty sure, but americans should do something about it. dream team again next world cup or olympics? lets hope so
Boys out there crushing taking care of business while having fun... focused energy
🥉
Austin Reeves needs to walk outside with a basketball jersey on for at least 1 sunny day.
One word from watching this! "Cohesiveness".
US team looks like what we need a team
Bobby getting those rebounds yes sir
Ants playmaking is looking ridiculous. I love it! Im a warriors fan but he always gonna get his flowers
Gonna be blessed to see this guys againt Spain and Slovenia this weekend 🙏🙏🙏
Haliburton is one of the NBA's brightest young stars, Haliburton does have good pattern recognition, and his team defense is solid. Definitely a pass-first point guard but knows how to turn it on
Shouldn't Puerto rico be merged with USA..it is a US territory.
HOOPING..#USA
Go Austin Reaves
Dayum! These cats are FAST!
I love how this team is full of pre-all stars 🔥
3:09 is this not a travel? I swear he took hella steps
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man they’re fast
Why is puerto rico a team?
The 🇺🇸USA basketball team was too good.🏀 ⛹🏽‍♂️  🙏🏼🌏✌🏼🕊☮️
Kuz shoulda been here
Incredible team. Absolutely love the unselfishness and energy on defense!
That went from watching a match up to watching Jamal Crawford versus Errol Spence.. 😂😂
USA USA USA USA !!!!!
And people said they would be boring lol
I like this team 🔥
This team is fun as hell to watch. Might just be able to make a gold medal run.
Props to coach STEVE KERR
Boys balled out.
J.Hart not playing? Why?
This should be an entertaining world cup.  Can't wait to see USA play some of the stronger teams and come up against some defense.  There are a handful of teams with a decent chance at the gold.
This is 50 states vs one territory of USA not fair lol. Im puertorican btw.. but Good to see Austin "Him" Reaves doing well as a Lakers fan !!
No Trae Young But No Complaints With Brunson Running Point, Well Deserved 💯💯💯
JJJ always been one of my favorites
This team FIRE 🔥 Perfectly fitting unit.
impressive for sure
I like the way they built this squad usa all the way
Praise the LORD for creating air time!
Lol this team USA is the weakest of all time
17 hours ago
Es Puerto Rico,además faltaron dos jugadores titulares de Puerto Rico. Pienso que el equipo de USA puede perder este mundial
LBJ should take note,😅
USA vs USA you mean?
The growth of Brandon Ingram is tremendous to me. With Ben Simmons being considers the best player in that draft. He has shown improvement every year. That boy a walking bucket
why they sittin at the game but not playin? smmfh
i kept thinking ingram was durant
Let's Go BI !!!
Easy Money, we  takin home the gold. #TeamUSA 🇺🇸💪🏾
So why no run for Josh Hart?
A-R 15!
Why does puerto rico have its own team? It is a part of the USA
Love the international game for these guys. Just less ticky tack fouls like the nba.   You can tell the nba officiating is the problem. They don’t flop as much in international because they won’t get the calls.
Our kids...they aren't too bad.  Who's next?
Ant playing floor general on both sides of the ball tonight
bring back melo 💯
This is the energy team USA has to bring with them next year.
PR got dominated 😂
50 literal states vs 1 doesn't seem very fair
I don't want to hear Bam is better than JJJ ever again. JJJ already has a back to the basket game
usa vs usa
Too much talent on this USA team bruh
Ingram shooting like Michael Kidd gilcrest
Yes ....As expected off this USA team. But i'm actually blown away by how nice the Puerto Ricans are... Like they're actually a really good team
Tyrese passing is so unbelievable, or at least it looks so playing against puerto ricko
Such a cool roster
Que pela
Nice to see new players represent the country really trying. Our country is good enough that our best players don’t have to always play just the ones who are hungry.
3:11 man traveled the whole world
I like seeing BI take more threes
USA not winning the tourney
This better than the 2019 USA team
Ja Zion & Trae should be on the roster
BI look too much like KD
I’d like to see Haliburton starting over Brunson.  Haliburton is a great passer
As a Puerto Rican, I'm proud that they even get to compete in stuff like this because now the world doesn't even honor our flag like they used to. I gotta say though I was born in the US, so this game is a win win for me no matter who woulda won....glad to see my boy AR15 playing for the US tho, dude deserves all the respect and praise he's been getting.
https://youtu.be/bJiv_PT0KTM
None of the players on the USA Team this year would have been on there in the 80's, 90's, or early 2000's, mid 2000's. I do not expect us to win this year.
Cam Johnson is huge wtf
Team USA just doesn’t feel like a championship team if u ask me
Haliburton gotta have to play more minutes then Brunson
The thing i like most about this usa team is they picked a team that actually plays hard and are enthusiastic about the game deff alot of people sleeping on this team just cause there not superstars
Waters is nice 🔥
some really clean moves by the USA boys
Where to watch full game
Puerto Rico isn’t a country if it’s a state in the US so why do we play them..??
The New Wave looking “TUFF”. LFG!!🇺🇸
USA is lacking shooting. Will be tough against legit teams
6:00 The Bucket Bros in their bucket hats. Back friends.
For Trae Young, the NBA leader in total assists in 2022-23 and the NBA leader in total points in 2021-22.... for him not making the all-star team and not making this USA olympic team we now know for a FACT there is a conspiracy going on against him
3:10 SUPER Travel!
ANT is my new faborite young NBA player
So beautiful😢
This was better than a real nba game 😂
Kai Sotto is better than this U.S team, lets go KAIJU
They are not beating Canada with SGA
This is the old style of how Team USA played when they use to dominate the top 10 teams. European style doesn't apply to them as their players have great talents which they need to capitalize on.
Is this the USA squad? They will lose in WORLD CUP.
What a run in the 2nd half!!! Let's go boys!!!
Interesting we recognize PR, a US territory as an opponent in basketball.  Rich history of PR and its players, they too performed well
I figured the leaders would be Ant, Ingram and JJJ. Cam Johnson was impressive. Wish to God my Pacers would have offered him a big contract. Pacers screwed up so many time's. I'd offered Jerami Grant one too. Hopefully they don't go for overrated OG next season. Id rather bring back PG for two year's to try and win a chip.. or trade Walker for a win now SF/PF. Like a Grant.
Is this the same team that we are sending to the Olympics in 24?
This starting team is nasty
They must don’t call travel..I seen like 50 of them😂😂
Halliburton got that Dimer Hall Of Fame badge no 🧢
paolo breakout szn, this usa team lit! young energy.
Players run right through Brunson. He's a defensive liability. Haliburton is the better PG easy. Yet they act as if Brunson is the better PG. Who plays 4  more mins averages only 3 or 4 more points at 24 a game. Hali can play 4 or 5 less mins and a get 20 + pts 10+ assists and 4 or 5 boards to Brunson 3 or 4 assists and possible 23 points in 4 or 5 extra minutes. Smh pshh.. lol joke
Team Canada all day fuck this weak ass C team
https://youtu.be/Ad2Ef1moLzo
https://youtu.be/Ad2Ef1moLzo
WOW❤😮😊
si John Holland pala yun 00 former import ng SMB haha
0:12, 1:38 - travel by a little guy from Puerto Rico
GG
START HALIBURTON OVER BRUNSON!
There are no super stars, but there are super stars. USA!
Too bad Ja is not in this team
Great game at the t mobile in Las Vegas had a great seat to watch the USA win
And everyone was talking this USA team was weak lol. They definitely don't watch basketball. You got triple J, Ingram, bridges, Edwards and Brunson as the starting 5 and promising future on the bench.
it took 3 quarters for all of those millions of dollars to start pulling away against PR. In the end, conditioning and fieldgoal % won the game.
Tempo is great, good length and entry being young and strong defensively this team has unlimited potential. I would be nice to a see a superstar or two join the team would love to see Steph, dame and Lebron hop on with the young bucks. That would be scary
Kerr system always gives you W
These MFS looking spooky bruh .... 🇺🇲🇺🇸
Gold medal coming back to America 😊
reminds of 1992 Team USA, less the names..these kids will be superstars on their own team.
Fook USA 😡
where can watch the games on? great win USA unselfish passing love to see it
4 months ago the nba was still going. What this dude talking about?
Ant man looking like the alpha star player on this team
Nba 2k needs Olympic part of the game where you get picked to play for the USA team or what ever team you wanna play for.
I never doubted it, this team has some talent! Looks like they enjoy playing with one another and that's the most important thing in international ball. That was a good game! Good defensive team and the scoring is there and plus they can get out and run. Size in lots of positions and that Austin Reeves has some skills! His game is perfect for international play! Tougher opponents will come but they will be good though.
scripted ass sport
The 1st string look good seems like everyone knows a role 2nd string look shacky tho
Este deporte da asco por que es americano que porqueria de pais es estados unidos
USA, the gaint of this sport🏀
No puertoricans playing for Puerto Rico 😢
Love it 🏆🐐🎯🙏❤
on god thought ingram was KD what it first started up and i was so confused
Having Reaves and Haliburton come off the bench with their playmaking skills is going to be lethal.
the next generation is here!!! time to showout
Nothing special... we will see with stronger teams
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
If they are going to win big they're going to need Paulo's defense to be locked in dude looks like a unit out there lol
Holders of US Passport vs another US Passport holders.
Va eso es SALSA A PUERTO RICO.
8:22 I definitely have to watch some of the Pacers and Haliburton. He's got a lil bit of that Jason Williams swag with Rondo vision.
Crazy to me cade aint on the usa team
JJJ suddenly looks big compared to the NBA
Time to adjust
Aun sigo apollando a PR
Seeing mikal, Brunson and hart on the same Olympic squad got me thinking I. 5-6 years we will see them on a squad together 😂
Love having Dick Vitale as the commentator
Paulo is freaking nasty the magic may be a problem next year
Lets Go
at first glance at the thumbnail i thought that was cj mccullom
Glad these young stars are playing playing, not just lollygagging. Great job USA
I'm sorry but that wasn't USA vs PR, that was USA C team vs USA F team.
Getting a skilled USA team was never an issue, it was solely getting the players chosen to play well together. To have great chemistry. This is a fun USA team to watch!!
Real competition is going to be Canada France Spain and Portugal, maybe 🤔 Brazil and Argentina as well
Team USA gets weaker and weaker as years go by.
Puerto Rico is the USA.
Ingram out there trying to get benched
I really like this squad.  No real "superstars" but all hard working players that will represent the US well.  Let's go!!
I thought Ingram was KD 3 times
Reaves! Baby! 💪
USA strong individual defenders everywhere Cam Johnson, Pablo & Ingram are going to be match up nightmares
Go USA
Loving there energy
Loving this team
Damn temlam USA did them dirty in the second half😂😂😂😂
Any one of these US players could easily get hot and score 30+ quick
Reeves and Edwards are going to benefit from the working out with the best players, I guarantee they're going to have the best seasons of their career next year
What a Team Win the chemistry is top notch
I thought Puerto Rico was part of the USA
Just imagine Ja was on the team 💡
USA vs USA😂🤦🏽‍♂️
I like what I’m seeing.
The USA team is gonna dominate if they keep playing like this
Team USA looking like they should be 💯🤝 strong , good chemistry  , good defense don’t get to cocky though remain humble 💯
Kai Sotto will dominate this team 🤡
🇺🇸Go USA
For some reason I thought Banchero was Italian
Oh they about to be a whole problem this year!!!!!
Center for Rico is pretty good
Edwards looks taller than 6'5"
Love seeing kd and draymond and the game wow it’s a new generation fr.
I love this game
BI's passing is ELITE
NBAs future right here
Patrick Beverly is on the Puerto Rican team wtf
Dang! They play as a team!!!! No ego!
Owned those Cuban fruads
Jaren Jackson is elite
U.s team looks surprisingly promising
Lucky that Jose Alvarado cannot play for PR 😢
Que pela ese equipo de puertorico está más flojo que mi abuelo a los 95 año da pena ese. Equipo de puertorico se pueden llamar la más porquería
🦅 🦅 🦅 🇺🇸 🇺🇸
That boy Anthony Edwards up next.. he not exactly a kobe or mj but you can tell he up next
Ain’t Puerto Rico part of the US or am I tripping?
Now thats how u represent the USA, GOOD JOB YOUNGSTERS CAUSE PAST FEW YEARS YALL BEEN MISREPRESENTING
I LIKE this team!!! alot of versatility and shooting,decent iq levels and they all play with energy! unselfish, great ball movement (contagious).and everybody on the team is young and hungry! refreshing to see compared to some former teams full of superstars that kinda coasted at times
I like this young team, still need to be a little more aggressive defensively like playing teams like Spain. But I can see them winning it with their determination and hustle. Good win USA 🇺🇸
First y’all was saying they will be third place now y’all switched and on the bandwagon nah stay where you had doubts at 💯#Teamusa
It's crazy the nba still don't want Tremont waters on somebody roster
So where all the haters at now? This team is so tuff
Lebron style travel @ 3:10
Let’s go USA
Walang gantong mga galawan sa gilas mga pilipino hoy tandaan niyo yan
lol Puerto Rico is not part of the usa??
❤
Nice ballin' by USA. Great effort. Hope they go all the way. I think they will.
Tyrese Halliburton is damn good
Reves 💪🦾
Second round exit
You got to remember this is FIBA, not the Olympics. These teams are always meant to develop the next crop of NBA stars. Think of the past FIBA US rosters, the following NBA season, saw major improvements from every single participant for the most part!
Ayyyy, as a Bulls fan it's nice to heard Adam Amin already.
I wished Lamelo would’ve been able to play…. I’d choose him over Brunson
Well balanced US team! Definitely gettn some medals out of this team! The only thing that got me is a country vs a state isn’t Puerto Rico part of the US?
at 6:24 where was half the team at wtf they js watch paolo play defenese.
very enjoyable basketball
Brandon Ingram look just like KD with #7 on
I'm here to see everyone who said they'd lose every game and are now d riding
Wait but Pr is apart of America????
dang, watching this USA team play, they look like they having a lot of fun.  if ur an up and coming young talent in the NBA, why wouldnt u wanna play on a team full of young talent on team USA?  if anything, it would just be fun to play with this type of talent all together on one team. win or lose, its just fun being able to trust one another to make a play.
What the hell happened to PR here…? This is unacceptable…
Man they don't even call travels in fiba. My man Romero was walking at 3:10
Is the court smaller?
I like this crew :) can’t wait to see how they do but it ain’t gonna be no walk in the park….
Where are those people saying team USA is not a good team?

The Gospel:  Matthew 3:2 2 “Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.”  1 Corinthians 15:3-4: 3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, 4 that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,  John 3:16-18: 16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.  18 “He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.  Ephesians 5:29-32: 29 After all, no one ever hated their own body, but they feed and care for their body, just as Christ does the church— 30 for we are members of His body. 31 “For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.”[a] 32 This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church.  1 Peter 2:24: “He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.”  (Hi!

Tyrese Halliburton is ridiculous
I’m here for Reaves
PR got a good team tbh
Good team, but theres one major weakness, the post. JJJ will be tested against guys much older, bigger, and nastier down low.
"The Meme Team"
I love this team, every player just plays the game so smoothly and at their own pace to the point that everyone just gels so nicely.
Grabe Naman team USA very athletic ambibilis pa
They fresh off the AAU circuit they know what to do 💯😂
3:09 am I trippin or did he travel twice
We all know these are the UNDERDOGS of the tournament
is it just me or does brandon ingram look like kd from this view
Where do we watch the game live?
lakas ng US team takbo lang ng takbo mauubusan ng hangin kalaban
that Puerto Rico squad was quite impressive, feel like they just haven't had the stamina
I know he missed the layup but that fake spin towards the baseline move by AR15 @7:27 was nasty
Raferty makes games 100x better
Anthony edwards gotta be Jordan’s son too 😂😂
Great game Team USA Defense & selfish basketball gone helps us win it all this year
this team so fun 🤩
They play good
The team usa go go gold
Too fast too good
team USA is always on steroids in basketball 🏀 and american 🇺🇸 football. divided we fall UNITED we stand🇺🇸 GOD bless america thank you Jesus Christ for this great country amen.
It's good to see Brunson leading as a floor general.  Austin is playing like Klay thompson 2014 version
My only nitpicks is that Tyrese and Reaves should be starting in the backcourt and Brunson along with Bridges should be brought in off the bench to come in and light it up.
Idk what it is but Anthony Edwards reminds me so much of kobe
Good job💯
Coach Kerr 🎉
Gotta make a 2K Roster for this one 🔥🔥
This was a good game
Tyrese started a little slow but when they picked up the pace, he picked picked the defense apart with his passing. aye
Imagine if that team had Ja Morant my goodness
How I wish Zion is included in this team USA.
This team has some very well rounded fast paced players on it. Not to mention none of them are selfish. They can very well bring home the trophy for us.
Roman’s 10:9 If you profess by mouth Jesus is Lord and believe God raised him from the dead you will be saved 🔥
USA ALLDAYYYY
What happened? 😂 In the beginning I thought they have a close match, and then.... 🙈
we shouldn't forget that those kids are raising start
Mid
They're playing super unselfish, great spacing and cutting, and always looking for each other. Reminds of the dream team concept not the players obviously. But these guys are super athletic and playing unselfish
Why people are making fun of the USA team it seems like we got some nice depth players and everything for a good run to gold  so what’s the problem?🧐🤨
Where can I watch the full replay of the game?
How many of the kids on PR are actually born there and don’t just have a grandparent from there? Like 3 max? 😂😂😂
lol everybody who talked shit about this team....where you at now
saw ingram and my first thought was "whats KD doin out there"
Talk about Air Craft Carriers of Basketball
It’s giving 2008 redeem team. Gotta love it, seeing the change in culture in this team.
I wasn’t expecting those young guys to come alive in that second half like that. Honestly enjoyed what I have seen so far. They look amazing (pause). Very solid on offense and defense.
JJJ is the perfect Center for team USA. good shot blocker, agile and can space the floor. He gon be key
luka bout to eat these guys for breakfast
better than the 2019 roster USA BASKETBALL will be in good hands under coach Kerr❤
Halliburton should be starting along with Pablo banchero
5:38 most ridiculous foul call in a long time
team got some dawgs Bridges gonna have a breakout season and same with Edwards and Halliburton
Can we have some or these players on the Olympic teams instead of ball stoppers like James Harden?
Zion needs to get it together he supposed to be on this team
Reaves Rules!  End of game & rather than being "NBA lazy," he attempted a full-court shot.  That extra rep mentality is a winner
They just need to get out and run
The fact they started Brunson over Halliburton gets me so furious.
Very talented versatile squad for the US
🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷🇵🇷
You can see lineups that look weak and they don't have superstars but when they are on the court they are very strong and have energy. Offense is the best defense
@2k
Why is Ingram’s move becoming KD-like?
This team has no chance against the elite squads...nice win
I smell gold
In a perfect world: if Gelo made the league, Zo was healthy, and Melo was just being Melo, this would have been the perfect platform to showcase the thee brothers playing togather😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥 Would have been magical
AUSTIN REAVES IS TOOO NICE
brunson and haliburton got them RUNNING
Reaves the most famous person on the team😂🔥🔥
Is just Puerto Rico yall… 😂
You don’t want to mess with a team full of NBA players
1:36 He definitely traveled in ref face
Very fast and energetic USA team....good teamwork!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
USA is the most stronges player of basketball in the world imagine this team USA now is not totally high caliper like a supertar caliper like lebron durant or curry but they still dominate the country the prove the world all high skills player of basketball in the world is in the usa im excited the team usa in the olympic because all superstar like lebron durant curry is ther dream team again
Tyrese that dude! 12 ast
I'm sure this was a bit of an adjustment for most of them. International ball is basically "real" basketball, which the NBA doesn't play: ball movement, more than just ball screens, etc...you can tell, too, like how Jackson didn't immediately roll after the switch on the ball screen at 1:29. This will be a good experience for them to help improve their overall IQ and skillset for the upcoming NBA season
If we run hard and play defense we could come home with the gold!
Fck yeah more basketball to watch.. Wish NBA was year round
This might be the weakest team USA in a minute……they’re supposed to be winning by 90
Team USA is wack, it should be all your top tier players. Majority of these guys didn’t make All Star lol
This is lit. If y'all toxic fans don't like this team then you don't know what they're capable of.
Un juego SIN baile fisico. FIBA es un juego de impacto que Puerto Rico no lo hicieron.
Nobody believes this type of blowouts anymore.. If you are brave enough, challenge an Europe country and share the results.. I know its harder than making films that show how great USA is... This match means nothing 😂😂😂
This team is going to need a lot of coaching and all in on defense to be successful.
It’s a lot of young guns on this team if they keep pushing the ball after every rebound it’s gonna be tough stopping these 20 year olds
They are looking really good. especially adding young players.
Shoutout Tremont Waters - he was lookin smooth out there for PR
Nba future looks 🔥 👌 👀 🙌 💯  AR15 AUSTIN LETS GOOOOO 👏
That defense is top notch, beautiful game played by USA.
Lmao, I thought Ingram was KD.
I love the way Brunson moved the ball and was active on the boards. Definitely wanna see him look for his shot more against Slovenia and Luka.
We bringing home the gold our defense will be too much
is that ant or mj
Wait I thought Puerto Rico is in the US
its funny af how whenever its puerto rico the one losing you cant seem to find one single comment sore ass losers😂
Reaves's behind the back stop middie is unguardable
Very Entertaining Game Good Teamwork 💪👍🏻
I think this is a very inexperienced nba roster
They run like crazy, their pace is impressive, it's going to be a good team
Wow AR15 in Team USA!!! Let's Go!!!
Ingram Jumpshot is nasty work 😂🤮
thats the team usa that we missed
A lot of people doubted the USA team but they proved it now and they will prove it in the FIBA world cup
Team USA's baby bunch
This is what i love to see out of my usa ball
Jalen Brunson and Mikal Bridges on the same squad again? Gold!
its crazy how these are the new faces of basketball
Austin rievs🔥🔥
Not sure where FIBA got those baskets but they suck. Look how much they move when they try to dunk on the rim.
That transition pace is 100% the touch of Mark Few
Cam Johnson looks like he still growing
BI looking stronger and taller.. but his shot looks off to me a little weird. i expect ant man lvl up this season.
JJJ literally the perfect center for this tournament long as he stay out of foul trouble
Ingram is a mirror image of KD
Casuals saying this team wasn’t good lol
Why are team usa purposely picking our lower tier players to go for the gold?? Are there restrictions?? Like wtf is this team??
new generation for the basketball players.
Can 2k add this to their game or it’s just copy and paste every year
love to see it go USA
These guys are so much fun to watch - I prefer it over seeing the super stars of the league play together
What a Travel at 3:10
This means nothing. We always dust Puerto Rico. They got to worry about the good teams (Spain, Canada, Slovenia, Argentina)
jesus fucking christ that paolo block made me jump out my chair
Ingram look like kd
Now i see Brunson-Morant Trade Scenario. :D
Aiming for bronze. 😂😂😂
CONGRATS TEAM USA MAGNIFICENT GAME🎉
Brandon Ingram swole?!? MVP season 2024?
Good exhibition game. I'm excited to see Ingram and Brunson shine in the FIBA games. I'm glad these refs aren't as stern as the NBA ones, a LOTTA shuffling feet that couldve been called traveling.
Nice👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
1st half seemed pretty competitive. In the 2nd it looks like PR ran out of gas and didn't have the depth of a U.S Bench to make up for it. JMHO.
i think canada will win over usa
Brunson is the new Cp3
Damn kerr done tremendous job here
This teams runs so well
Just bought a "USA Basketball" shirt
Did Brandon Ingram hit another growth spurt?! I swear he keeps getting taller
LETS GOO ANT!!
Puerto Rico is part of the United States so I really don’t get it
if this team doesn't win the world cup they should all retire.
Romero TRAVELD BADLY 😔3:10
There`s NO WAY this team gets gold in WC...
I’m confused because Puerto Rico is part of the United States
No carry at 1:40?
every time romero #28 got the ball he did a crazy travel lmao
Can't wait to see Usa vs Canada for gold.
Ant wearing Kobe number 🥹🥹🥹 I still can’t believe he is really gone man. Like I know it’s been some years now but I still can’t believe it bro.
crazy that you don't see an NBA superstar in USA team these days.. Is it because top NBA players are majority International players?
Puerto Rico is USA
5:41 was the stupidest foul call in my entire life
How many of these guys will make the Olympic team next year? I liked the energy and unselfishness and the defense.
This USA team will lose. The teamwork is awful. Nobody can really take over a games. I imagine they get a bronze
Idk what Gil was talking about lol this team is fun to watch
#51 that was a travel carry and double dribble on the first possession that wasn't called
usa looking strong
America vs technically “not” America
Ingram isnt skinny anymore bearly reconize him damnn
The ACTUAL 92 Dream Team would woop this current crop by 40.....FACTS 🥱
6:00 kd and green?
Dream Team, Dream Team 2, The Redeem Team, now we have the Things are what they seem Team, and I love their unselfish style. One team one unit they’ll be tested yes but Gold is the standard but silver or bronze will be an accomplishment.
Edwards really look like young jordan in the face😅😅😅
first play of the game an nba ref is calling a offensive foul and checking replay for hostile act. only thing cant be debated the officiating of physicality of the fiba / OLYMPICS so much better
Surprised sga isn’t on this team
They don't have superstar in the roster but they have superstar coaching staff.hehe
Nothing like USA vs USA
Banchero ciucciami u cazz
The team is actually much better than it looks on paper.  Love the chemistry!
U.S. vs U.S.
how tf is puerto rico keeping it close????
0:47 that pass was clean
this kerr system of selfless basketball really get these guys goin and i mean all of em.
The question is whether the USA will show #1 Spain everything when they play on Sunday, a day after playing Luca and Slovenia.
I LOVE when the US plays PR, cuz as a Puerto Rican, I always win, no matter who wins :)
USA overrated teams is gonna get exposed as hell,they should be happy if they get to top5
I got diarrhea and these boys is flowing more consistently than that lol amazing
🇺🇸
I think Bobby portis is key excellent emotional leader might be key for development for the bucks... But JJJR is the ultimate mismatch on this team
inggram looks like durant
Haliburton is so good bra 🤦🏾‍♂️😮‍💨
The twins are the best!
steve kerr made a warriors 2.0 😭
How bout keen green team? Young and sharp talent all around.
Isn't PR an American territory? They are facing their own country?
Usa usa. Usa
Had me in the first half
If this says anything its that defensively is how USA will have to get it done
May not be the best team talent-wise, bit they are complimentary to each other
This team has much better changes of winning games than a team full of selfish superstars who don´t like to play defense and don´t like to share the ball. Watch out for team USA.
Tremont waters is an NBA point Guard
I feel so lost!! When did they choose this olympic team?!?! Reeves? Edwards? Brunson? Great chemistry all around though!
tremont waters tuff
The team looks great but y'all minimize the dickriding they haven't done shit yet ☝🏽
Why does Puerto Rico have a team they are US citizens right?
I have 2 concerns about this team: The struggle against FIBA rules and not having a classic #5 with size
Puerto rico is very weak team
Why is the USA playing Puerto Rico?
This team usa is so well balanced, you wont have a problem also in crunchtime because you got ingram, brunson and ant there.
Don’t jump on USA bandwagon now talkin shyt about them didn’t even see them play yet until now they ll be ready
That guy Waters is cold
Puerto Rico Team Is Azz😂🤣
Its just me or edwards looks like jordan and plays like it.😊
very strong team of USA
Felt like every possession was a fast break lol
USA playing like the Warriors… run run run pass pass pass.. nice to see the ball is moving and they’re all running!! excellent basketball!   good luck 👍🏼 💪🏼
Heeeey its good seeing these guys on the court together.  You can tell the theme this time around is unselfish young men.  USA got this
Gosh Damn
JJ is a beast
😮😮😮❤
I think this game really highlighted Haliburtons advantages over Brunson. Hes long with great hands and effective court vision. Can handle, pass, play defense, shoot and attack. Say what you want but Im taking Tyrese over Brunson anyday
This US team not good
Great team effort! This is what I was hoping to see. These guys are just gonna hustle.
Lebron almost got sent home from the redeem team.. Media never told us about that..😂🤣
Wow I was not confident in this team. However , the unselfishness gives me hope. Great win !
America vs America
How many points did Bronny have? 🏀
Muy superior USA
I really like this team
What was gilbert arenas and shaq saying again???
Lawannya suhu basket US 😅gmn 😅..
Watch they team up in the future cause of this
3:22 BIG shot, huge no-call. Easy foul imo. USA will always have the talent to beat anyone tho.. They're winning 9/10 comps for the next few years
Why is walker kessleer on this squad?
Full tank n idol no skip ads thanks for sharing bagong kaibigan
I know this has nothing to do with anything but i love how Puerto Rican players look black
They were so good in transition this game
They played like they've known each other for so long🔥💯👑
Go Team USA!
This squad and Ja would be crazy!!
PUERTO RICO, YA NO SIRVE,  ESTAN CAGAAAOOS.  LA ISLA DEL ESPANTO
Puerto Rico showed they lack talented players, hope they learn where they belong 😎
Unselfish basketball👏👏👏
USA team is very Dominant
That’s what you call a whooped ass 😂😂😂
Just add Booker, Fox, Tatum and Adam Lavine and you got a gold medal team.
Tbh , not impressed. ANT isn’t that guy. We got a bunch of 3 and D guys trying to play scorer. Ingram isn’t consistent. Jalen is the only one that’s going to get tough buckets.
Canada at australia
Well we will be more conditioned than any other team for sure. Love the new young faces of the league taking over. Bring back that medal guys ❤
Basketball is a culture in the USA.
well....that was an azz whipping.....
Engram looking good😮‍💨🔥🔥
where is lamelo ball
Tremont Waters belongs in NBA!!! Get ‘em young boy
Tremont Waters needs to be on an NBA roster again smh
this team doesnt have the absolute superstars, but what is way more important is that you got a good team and they have just that. they have defense, playmaking and most importantly spacing
Bancero isn’t Brazilian ?
Puerto Rico gave their best but the gap in talent beetween both teams is enormous, still good first half by my puertorican team🇵🇷
https://youtu.be/3TQTV7LGgvM?t=184 The hell is this 5 step travel
Young legs!
Weakest U.S team EVER😅😅😅😅
🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸🇺🇲🇺🇸!
Austin reeves isnt a fluke… dude hust gets to his spots!!!
The puerto rican team is like second-division league players!
Favorite to win cup trophy..
Looked good.. good energy.. movement on offense...hustle on defense... looks like they're taking it serious
Tyreese on the 2nd squad coming off the bench is going to be a problem for teams. I dont think ppl know how good he is cuz he plays for the pacers. But that dude a baller
Ant man 🥶👿
Nos fuimos a las galletas bien PR
Haliburton + any athletic forward = easy $$
Impressive.
Cam Johnson is gonna be the one to watch this tournament, expect a breakout year from him this year…
they carry the ball every position, move their pivot foot on the post.... and there is no call. this is nuts.
By 43 😭😮‍💨🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
That is basketball right there! 💯‼️
I like the second with haliburton, unselfish basketball
NBA is a waste of time and money supporting these clowns will eventually take a unnecessary toll on your life.
Let's go USA!!!
Montverde high school would beat that team lol
The fact that it took a whole 3 quarters to get blown out is amazing win for Puerto Rico considering their population is equivalent to .01% of America’s population. Another example of the world catching up
Team chemistry is on point.  Fun to watch.
Nice to see the USA play team basketball instead of isoball
I don't know anybody on the team usa?
Loving their youth and exuberance. Team USA always satisfies my summer appetite for basketball 😋
I remember once upon a time when the USA team used to have so many legends, now its a team full of scrubs like they got picked up for a pick up game at my gym LA-Fitness. SO sad
7:06 bobby XD
Defense, fundamentals, and hustle got us the win🇺🇸
not a bad game for the C team
Balance scoring for team USA, fast faced! Good pick up
Good job usa
No fouls called ??? 😂
Hali loves passing🥰
Jalen Brunson is great but u=it just makes more sense for him to play with the second unit and Tyrese starts..
You guys played so good🎉Go USA🎉😎🏀
Tremont Waters is so shifty
My boy Reeves looking good. Go Lakers!!!
Should've been a blow out from the start...team USA ass
Brunson should be coming off bench
canada is waving
imagine Ant and JJJ on the same team 😮‍💨
Bro puerto rico is the usa… they have to pay our federal taxes and all that…
Awesome
Time for me to stop living in the past and embrace the future. This USA is very impressive but please keep creating your own legacy’s. No Dream team stamp for them just yet
This team woulda been perfect for westbrook to show off what he still has!
I wonder what Gilbert Arenas gotta say about this?😂😂😂
Judging by the majority of the comments it seems everyone is surprised by how well they played and I don’t get why everyone is so shocked , these are the younger , more athletic players of the league of course they’re going to be fast and explosive. I think they are waaay better then people think , honesty you put this team up against any other recent USA World Cup team I think they get it done.
Wow..
High IQ basketball from this team. Exactly what you need to dominate on the international level.
No curry clay kyrie
Nice to see haliburton running the floor...the next CP3
This has to be the most diverse Team USA team ever all time in terms of skill set.
Nice team chemistry!
Everybody share the ball and play tremendous defense
I haven’t seen enough to say they are better than team Canada
That's exactly what USA basketball should do to Puerto Rico, 30 point pita roll minimum
cant wait for this team to face france or spain. Gonna be exciting but serbia or australia might be a suprise for them also. Still gold medal for team USA
Very impressive team work and hustle by the US, just give them the title now if they continue to play like this, Olympic Gold as well! 🤔 idk even where the next Olympics being held 🤔 think maybe France Gay Paris, I know  Italy have the winter one!
Where did Puerto Rico find so many black dudes?
😂🤣
03:12 travel or not ?
Who thinks Hali should start over Brunson …
more like an all star team 💯
LOS ANGELES LAKERS 💪
It was a close game till 5 minutes into the  first quarter!
No need for iso plays…
Isnt Puerto Rico part of the us ??
Not that I want anyone to get hurt but as a Pacers fan with the best franchise player since Reggie, please stay healthy Tyrese!!
It’s not Ingram it’s KD😁
Guys it is Puerto rico😂😂😂 shit team
for a second I thought Bridges was KD😂
3:14 my man’s traveled 3 city blocks! Omg LeBron ain’t got nothing on him!
cant even smoke puerto rico smh
every great role player played together without superstar on their team loving it
idk why Tremont not in the league right now
Is it jus me or does Ingram look like he put sum weight on ?
Great game
NO ONE CAN BEAT THIS TEAM. NOT EVEN THE US  B-TEAM
Can Johnson wearing number 6 some bum wearing number 9 😂
Edwards plays like Jordan
As French, i wonder... Why there is no NBA's stars in the Team USA ? Is it just because it was a showcase game, or they usually prefer to stick with their franchise and don't really care about national team ?
I’m a Knicks fan and I’m surprised Halliburton isn’t starting over Brunson
We going lose if they think Brunson leading them . I don’t get why everyone thinks he so good
When are they playing Slovenia???
Good win gang. Great team play
1:37 TRAVEL
For WC gold, they need to be fine tuned and aggressive in defense . There are some TOUGH teams out there.. France, Spain, Serbia, Greece etc...
I’m confused. I thought they didn’t play til a few more weeks
Also that center for PR is a dawg no 🧢, & romero can Ball. Was giving usa the work in 1st half fr
Bill Raftery is everywhere!!!
One hell of a 2nd half dominant performance. This team defensively is gonna be hell for opponents once the actual tournament starts 🏆
We need LaMelo
Bring home the gold guys! I believe in y’all 🥇🇺🇸❤️
Where's D. Fox?
Ingram too strong💪
Why didn't posted the game between Memphis and the Dominican Republic team ????
Exciting to watch with Steve Kerr coaching. Amazing young guys with veterans👏🏻
Kaigit
Phoenix should not have let Cam Johnson go.
Why Edwards look like Mike
Halimaw yung US HAHAHA lakas
6:20 man literally Blocked himself
luv this team -- ant man and tyrese are tough tough combo
Good unselfish team!!! They look good!!!
Either Canada or Serbia omight win this world cup.
It’s a good win, but U.S always have trouble with the EURO big team.   Hope we can out run them with this young energetic unselfish team.
NOP gets a huge break after trading AD in exchange for Ingram.
So sad that Temetrius Jamel Morant ain't on this team😔
Haliburton looking like magic johnson
So no one gonna talk about waters he’s cold ⚔️
JJJ has powerful athleticism at his size
Y’all Lucky 🍀 We Ain’t Send Ja Morant 😂😂
What is the is this the USA’s C team? I mean these aren’t superstars. This is not even worth watching.
Canada will run circles around this team
Keep up the good work USA
And they were saying Canadas team is better than ours 😂😂😂😂
I was expecting this to be somewhat competitive and it was for the first half. I don't understand wtf happened in the 2nd half. Credit to Puerto Rico. An island of just 3 million people and still having a decent team, but we (islanders) weren't blessed with height 😂 ...  So credit to them for at least giving the U.S. a competitive 1st half.
Lo singan a pr😂
Bruh ain’t nobody Puerto Rican😂😂😂
Pointless games no1 beating usa
First half was war. Puerto Rico played tremendously hard but didn’t get a few calls like the and 1 three pointer. 3:28 Second half Puerto Rico didn’t execute how they’re capable too. They can definitely beat any team including USA
Cuando tengan que atacer una zona veremos lo que ocurre.
For as much as I can't stand the NBA these days, this is a decent team.
Speed  quickness agility  tough to beat
Let's go
Nice selection of player LAHAT cla magaling energetic tsaka maganda yong ball movement nla good job team USA
young and discipline bunch of future all star
unbelievable😂
4:38 that is kd there in the corner
Di uubra yan sa Puso ng GILAS🖖🔥😅
Tell that women’s soccer team that this is how you represent our country.
Next!!!
Puerto rico is a force to be reckon with probably the best team I seen in 8 to 10 years maybe more
Puerto Rico sucks.
As a Warriors Fan, I am disgusted with Kerr when he alienatqed over half of the Warriors fan base insulting American and whining about Politics for the far left extremists. Keep Politics out of Sports. NBA is WOKE. That's why I won't waste my money supporting these overpaid selfish goons.I also lost respect for Curry too. The players in the 80s and 90's were more physical and far superior.
Dem boys look gooooood
there's so many comments, but no one appreciate Tremont Waters
That Puerto Rico pg was hoopin fr 😭📖
Man the nba is In a Great position so much Young ascending talent on top of having your OG's at the Top💯🏀🔥🔥👏🏿👌🏿
😂 so poor. It's a USA vs Puerto Rico game. And  the Kraut wears nba team Shirts 😂😂😂
JJJ is built different.
I’m guessing Zion and Ja aren’t eligible ?
But Puerto Rico is a US territory 🤔
Ppl talking shit on this team are anti American. And they're gna bandwagon
USA vs Puerto Rico. So its the US vs The US? 😅
Why is Austin Reeves on this team?🤷🏽
Let's all be real these maybe nice guys or decent players but the USA TEAM IS DEAD AND NEEDS STARS TO COMEBACK OR JUST SEND OUR COLLEGE KIDS.
Wow
mvp is austin reeves for banging that switcharoo hoe taylor swift
ingram gained muscles😳😳😳
Is it just me? Ingram looks bigger 💪
Only philippines can beat team USA 🤣
I guess Port rico isn’t part of the U.S
Doncic
This team could win gold in the real thing. Arenas was talking crazy. Shoutout to Jerry C for the turnaround  🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💯💯💯💯
JJJ
I wish they started Tyrese, he got 12 assists off the bench
They look good!!✌🏽
This Team USA new guns will be alright as long as they make defense the first priority and make the extra pass. The talent and athleticism is there.
He looks like Andre Ward the pro broxer
The real test will be against Spain Greece and Germany in the warm up games.
I love how you can hear Mom cheering in the background 🤣
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Have to keep getting better you was supposed to beat this team. Team Canada ain’t no joke .
Like Dream Team 1,,Super ❤
Its just puerto rico. European countries is a bigger challenge for US
Puerto Rico gotta call in cousins . Lol that would have been awesome
Obviously not a match for the US, but I'm impressed with this Puerto Rican side. They've got some hoopers.  But yeah, these American up and comers are exciting as hell.
Porque perdieron tan feo? si estados unidos está jugando con un equipo B
USA USA USA
Best game
Is this a FIBA court or an NBA court?
Not quite full highlights
They can stop hyping Reeves He's like the worst player on this team next to Hart
look at my lil cuz on team Puerto rico
Don't be confused by African American, Puerto Rican, etc. We are all Original to the Americas...We just played our cousins! Puerto Rico just means Rich Port.
🔥
Вот скажите мне. Зачем США уговаривает Эмбиида играть за них? У них настолько раздутый состав, что можно на 3-4 команды собирать и участвовать. Уверен, до четвертьфинала каждая бы дошла. Финал был бы США 1 - США 2. Так зачем им вообще эмбиид ? Настолько боятся , что он может заиграть за Францию и вместе с Вембаньямой прекратить династию США на международной арене?
Usa plays like european...very nice
We DON'T NEED NO BIG NAME PLAYERS. THESE BOYS GOT IT.
We look good. can't wait to see USA go against Luka,the Greek freak,jokic all of the best international players
Jesus is the only way to Heaven!  - John 14:6  "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me".  Repent now before it's too late!
Did Ingram change his shot he got a chicken wing going on
Congrats to the USA team ❤🎉
Really solid team
I am not American and despite their defeat in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2017, they are still the best players in the world, they have the highest level of basketball and this new generation will make teams like France or Slovenia suffer
damn i have cards most of them at Myteam 2k23
Derek Brunson reminds me of Derek Fisher, with how he walks with the ball, how he passes and his shot formation.
Everybody was dogging this team, but looks like this young crop of USA players play a better brand of basketball than LeBron, Wade, etc, in the early 2000s.  So much more ball movement, better shooting and high IQ decision making.  The future of the NBA looks great.
USA ready get another BRONZE 🥉 this coming FIBA Basketball World Cup 😅😂😅😂😅😂
Good Match to these team. See you in the Philippines ❤
Thanks for showing some of the other team's highlights, too.
Good
Easy work
Brunson is  on his way to become a future typical fat coach
Paolo Banchero is so promising.
why is de aaeon fox not on the team??
This is why Puerto Rico shouldn’t be playing basketball
Wow!!
7th place finish again, USA sucks
🐜
Team looks pretty decent. Nothing against Brunson but I think De’Aaron Fox would take this team to another level. Talk about fast play
How many ads can y'all fit in this video
I feel even they are good now but they will not win the World Cup just feeling !! What do u think ?
Ingram has grown bigger.
Traveling over and over again. Hope FIBA referees are going to sanction that.
Mannnn I was about to say… 😂😂😂 look good, looked like old fashion basketball. I loved it!
Canada is the team that threat to USA.
Impressive!
When reeves scored the cheers were louder ; racially motivated
This team is actually dangerous. Young and fresh legs! The chemistry is on point tbh. Impressive!! Keep it up team USA!! See you here in the Philippines 🇵🇭
You can really see the difference of an NBA PLAYERS!! the way they run, they move.. Never stops even a very big margin.. They will really treat the game as if they were loosing.. KAI, pls show us the effort like those BIGS are doing.. BANCHERO/JACKSON
I like the team. 5:38  This foul was crazy though 😂
3:15 was some doofy lookin shit. Also looked like he took 6 steps within 3 seconds and one dribble lmao
Let's go ar15
Loving this team USA They played with effort and teamwork
that waters dude on puerto rico needa be in the league
USA is young. Interested to see how they play against tougher competition. I do think they play good team ball, didn't see a lot of ego out there. Seem like the all get along. Jalen Brunson really impressed me with the command he had out there. A Point Guards Point Guard. Austin Reeves plays like a taller John Stockton.
USA kids straight hoopin’ - love to see the next gen dominating.
They turned up the defense! The youngins look hungry. I like it!
0:10- traveling. guys what you will do in world cup :D :D
Puerto Rico was impressive not gonna lie But the US is really solid this year  Gonna be an interesting run
INGRAM??? BRO LOOKS LIKE KD WITH NUMBER 7 ON HIS BACK!
Bizimkilerle kapışmasını merak ediyorum
Scrubs and benched nba players vs  junior jv teams
Abuso
Jalen Brunson - Jason Kidd 2.0 the basketball IQ.
Did better then USA before this one
Good passing and defense but when we get to the next Olympics it will probably once again be “Give the ball to KD and get the hell out of the way” should be KD last Olympics though unless he keeps playing as a catchNshoot or post scorer into his 40s.
Spain France Australia Canada better
Ingram look like he gained 20 lbs 😳
Anthony Edwards is Kobe
3:10 is there a violation in this play? I'm just looking at his feet and wondering the steps
HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAH the lead is so big
Team usa from ph
If Puerto Ricans are born US citizens why do they not just represent the US in Olympic games?
this why these niggas ina nba and dudes on PR team not
I LOVE BASKETBALL MAN
The Team that will Lead to the Next Redeem Team
This USA team can beat 1992 dream team in 20-30 points margin!
still proud of the boys 🇵🇷
This is a fun team
Why ant out there with no haircut
❤
Great Reaves <3
Great Reaves <3
Ingram w that #7 look like KD 😂
This US team got energy but can they really won the world cup against serbia or spain?
Aistin reaves is the goat
We down bad. Anytime we got Bobby Portis on the USA team. Half these guys haven’t even made an all star selection but they on the USA team. Smh
very cool to see dray and kd supporting
Keegan Murray didn't play??
Tyrese dropped some crazy dimes and pr was stuck in them 60s
Look at ingrams frame. So similar to kd
Wish Cade was on the squad . He is a great pace player & floor general
No way Ant Jordan is playing for USA
USA vs USA
Brandon Ingram has such a silky smooth game. I swear he keeps the ball on a string.
I deadass thought Ingram was KD
I thought Jordan Poole is on the roster.
1:19 the moves, body, and even the jersey number are 99% KD
This is a sick usa team. Lots of talent
AR-15
Anthony edwards is literally Michael Jordan
Edwards is becoming something special, engram looks like he is becoming great as well
😂🎉 Destroyed
Thats always the problem with team usa, they dont send their best player,, Imagine team usa LBJ KD Steph Klay Chef Taytum
1:37 🤔???
the Aussie Boomers are coming for you! get ready!
Grabe mga galawan nang mga kabilang team nato . Kung pilipinas makalaban nito cgurado . Tambak talaga ang score nito hahahaha
This USA team is as good as the Dream Team and the Redeem Team.
Who is the best player on this USA team? Ingram?
😩
They like we not losing
Those dudes having mad fun mad hustle
Oh man a group of young youthful guys with a lot of energy playing great American basketball mad Hustle from both sides dudes are good
With all my respect. They have played Puerto Rico. This team looks good but it has to play a real FIBA tournament against Serbia, Spain, Greece, Australia, Canada, France... They look good tho. Unselfish, quite like a FIBA team.
9:43
Here for Austin Reaves.
Puerto Rico is trash stop it folks
Great game! Puerto Rico gave Team USA a run for their money, but the Americans ultimately prevailed. Jalen Brunson and Anthony Edwards led the way for Team USA, while Justin Lopez and Gary Brown were standouts for Puerto Rico.
Trade Josh Hart and Kessler for Cade and Duren
Better than the US woman soccer team 👍🏻
Not impressive...this will get a hardtime winning in FIBA WORLD CUP...😢😢😢😢😢
Bro ingram gained some muscles
cant believe so many people said this was gonna be a bad team
Slow start. If they're against australia or any of the euro powerhouses, they'll never recover from that
Ay, Bendito
Impressive young guns
.
And everyone was saying how bad this team was going to be 🤦🏻‍♂️  Just because they’re not superstars doesn’t mean they can’t play
AR just do everything, glue guy and all
I'm not sure if this team USA is a gold medal team(they're roster is not that star-studded) but I'm rooting for them to win it all.
I understand the talk abt the US team but we gotta talk about Tremont Waters though undersized he gave the US problems for a min 🤷🏾‍♂️
This is team going to have problems with France, Canada, cause they way they played the first two quarters was not good
dude looks like kd
Brunson showing he can be an elite passing PG when surrounded by some scorers too. Looking like CP3 out there a little bit
Wait till they play Serbia 🇷🇸 oooo it’s gonna be lit af
Balance team, nice g!
40 prcent for usa💪
6th
Wtf are they playing a US territory for?
i’ll never understand how PR is technically part of the US but they’re not allowed to participate in our olympic teams
0:04 offensive foul...
Anthony Edwards is a beast
Speed game athletic and good ball movement of this Team USA squad
tremont waters!
The All Blacks of Basketball
These young bulls can ball USA 🇺🇸
This is BY FAR the worst USA team ever...these clowns are not CONSISTENT Superstars like the players before....I know why. . Majority of the "Stars" Parents are not from the US...they got rid of the players who come from "the black grassroots..they have the tether chip who parents fled here... They will get washed eventually. Oh well, they do not recruit OR DRAFT the REAL BLACK AMERICANS . LIKE THEY USED TO ..They doing/did the same thing in the NFL ....THIS IS WHY THE LEAGUE IS SOFT..THESE ARE IMMIGRANT CHILDREN PLAYING AS IF THEIR FAMILY IS FROM AMERICA AND ITS NOT...
They blew their backs out
Unselfish guys trying to find a groove not forcing well coached and they not even in 1st gear . 😊
Wat if they had ja 🥺 like dude need to chill he should be out there dunking on everybody
Anybody else get excited when he said “What a save!”
USA, young bulls without egos 💯🇺🇸
The ball movement is AHHMAZING!
Want to see euro and USA basketball because that's going to be more intense to watch
Flexin against Puerto Rico 😂😂 those cats have no chance against any elite european team
It is only puerto rico
1:38 travel.
What tournament is this? Like Olympic trials or something?
Brunson, reaves, Ingram. Going to be fun to watch. However, they need to learn to set their own pace… international eats you up if you try to match them on pace. However, I’m sure we’ll pickup another superstar come Olympic time.
🥲
See you in Manila US National Team !
Why they do my PR team like this 🫠
When the 2nd team get clicking it’s over first team clicking
Tyrese much better than Brunson!!!!!!
Size difference was apparent and USA played with more energy, better defense, better offense
PUERTO RICO REALLY COMPLETELY SUCKS😂 PUERTO RICANS CAN BURN IN HELL😅😂
this is entertaining to watch... potential talents are there, and love how quick they are on the court....
better than the current team
Lol where did Puerto Rico get black people from?
Okay wth was that call @5:40 😂😂😂
Lets be clear. This was Puerto Rico. A C-class inernational. But, if the US team stays humble and will get an go-to-guy in the crititcal moments they could win the WC. France, Spain, Germany, Canada and Australia, maybe Slovenia and Serbia are also strong
Trxsh ass team
Imagine if they had jayson Tatum and KD
I swear I missed how they got up by 40 , it happened so fast
I’m reserving my comment until I see them with team Canada
Isn't Paolo representing Italy?
Usa team 🎉🎉🎉 is always good
I really like this US team!!
There appears to be a lack of team play, with a reliance mostly on individual performances. When up against well-coordinated European teams with strong defensive systems, I'm curious to see how this team will fare.
This team USA have a lot of talents
Let's go usa
Where is the former Duke and Magic star from? If teams played for their countries we’d be in trouble..
3:11 Romero travel all the way from Puerto Rico with the ball
Dam such hustle and unselfish play. Made the right play every time
this 2023 team usa line up is better than team usa last fiba cup...
Eat!!!
Where is Zion? What's going on with Zion?
HEY GUYS...NBA... PUERTO RICO IS APART OF THE USA....DAMN... AMERICANS ARE DUMB...😆😆😆
This US team was put together very well
I think US must be banned in FIBA.
JA ZION TATUM BROWN & A COUPLE MORE SHOULD BE THERE
Mga bangko ni sa NBA teams 🤣✌️
Young Players Going Off
Loved watching the World Baseball Classic. Hoping FIBA WC doesn't disappoint either.
Yea this teams good to go great pace unselfish loving it
Ant Man
Cam Johnson without an undershirt, that's a rare sight
This is a YOUTHFUL TEAM USA very fast and furios
Gringo  1 contra griego 2
This team is what the previous one failed to be: a well working team. None of them are egoistic
USA
Austin Reaves 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If Portis wasn't on the team, this team USA's average age would be 23-24 years 😂
Very nice chemistry on this team
They look better than the last USA team ik that much i love the decision to go young can’t nobody keep up with them in transition frfr 😂😂😂
PR is a good team! Don’t sleep!
i mean PR is 100 miles by 35... let's see what we do against servia or argentina etc
These G-League superstars will shine on august 25 til fiba finals.
jaren Jackson 🔥🏀
idk how i felt ab this usa team until now, they’re looking pretty good
Team USA has picked a team thats going to struggle to finish top 5
They win by apt but think this team can win beat better countries in the workd
how is the move by Ingram not a travel 😅
Excellent roster from top to bottom. Shooting, playmaking, scoring, defense, rebounding, everything!
I guess they don't call travel here either
Gilbert Arenas statement didn't age well.
Puerto Rico is part of United States.
Austin "AR-15" Reaves the whole world will know your name
so Basically USA vs USA?
halliburton gotta start
they'll mesh and grow tremendously as unit into something special. Young, but High Character ballers with High IQ's plus a really good players coach in Kerr.
New Generation after the Warriors and Lebron legacy…NBA will be ok!
I feel like Ingram has gained weight
tyrese just out there having fun
Team Puerto Rico just niggas who lied about being mixed in middle school.
What a block by Puerto Rico.
I love how hard they're all playing. Several efforts on the glass, never gives up on defense, looking to share the rock, running whenever they get the chance. They're everywhere, love the young energy
So how many players are from PR????
Just wanna say tremont waters will always be a bucket
ingram needs this
Better than the 2003/2006 team
Austin Reaves belongs
Def performed better than people thought but we gotta see against stronger teams
Y’all must think is going to be that easy agains European teams 😂
Puerto Rico’s team is looking pretty uh… black.
Bro Anthony edwards only 22😂
Gonna be a good squad
1:37 not  a travel?
US Team is 70% beatable. lol
Treamont waters a bucket
Looking like gsw with that tempo. Haha Thanks coach kerr
bro this is usa vs usa select team B/C.. these "PR" dudes dont even know a lick of spanish... just joined cus they couldnt cut the USA squad. SMH.. im sure most of these young dudes dont even care for the culture... that's what hits me
❤
Impressive win by USA & happy to see Dray and Kevin support 😊
Jaren a naturally big dude
no mercy game by the team USA deyym😊
the NBA is in good hands
Both teams was hoopin fr you really seeing everyone’s talent
i like USA roster 2023🔥
How you get blown out by 40? If that was me, i wouldn't let that shit happen, but that's just me.
Brandon Ingram looking thicc like shawn kemp lol
Yea I f with gil arenas but him calling this roster trash he tripping frfr this a nice collective hungry bunch of solidified ballers should run through their competition
Typical Draymond letting the team down Zero points, really? Pathetic worst player.
Shout out to Puerto Rico made it pretty interesting the 1st quarter.
Say ⛔️🚫 to bronsexuals..=💩💩
Puerto Rico is the USA.  It is stupid to have two teams.
So many casuals said this USA team sucks lol. This is a young, athletic, and hungry team. They can compete with anyone
USA GOT SIZE!!
Spain or France will tear their a** up. Trust
Tremont waters a beast
Speed of the game is unmatched.
Puertiroco is Puerto Rico part of USA?
Can’t wait to see competition
3:10 travel on receiving the ball and then immediately on the way to the basket. Jesus Christ, even kids don't make such travels
starting 5 should be   Haliburten  Edwards  Bridges  Ingram  Jackson
Que pela😢
Haliburton and edwards gonna have breakout seasons if they keep playing like this.
Can this USA team do it against a proper contender tho
Ingram look like kd
really liking this team so far. not trying to be all flashy and playing great team ball!!
bruh yall need to stop hyping these dudes... this is not no 08 olympic team
Don’t know why people are doubting this team. Sure there’s no big names but if they can get their skill sets to work right they are a complete TEAM which is what this is about
Team P.Rico Crocodile 🐊🐊
At 4:17 a hater on 2k wouldve called a timeout if you were in the rec 😂😂
Jesus christ is coming soon.please Repent of your sins and beleive the gospel before it's too late. Were living the last days.🙏🙏🙏🙏
That Bridges and Edwards trap a killer. They were sleeping on how good this team is.
Where can u see the stats?
Good team effort by USA because Puerto Rico has some legit hoopers.
Huge W for team USA, I like the transition game and there defence was great too. The effort on defence was insane and they were all rotating well. The energy was nice and you could tell they know how to play with each other.
I swear thought Ingram was Durant.
Scary line up
When does group play start or is it a Torunament from get go? Or is there more exivitions to be played
Damn, this team is loaded. JJJ locking down the middle. With Bridges and Edwards, their defense can be really good.
USA VS PHILIPOINES IN FINALS 😅😅😅
crazy part is, this usa jv team
I dont think they can win on canada
Hold on. It’s Puerto Rico a US territory. Don’t need a passport so how do they have their own team.
Ok
Man We got a good Squad.  The chemistry was superb.
Man, Tyrese is entertaining to watch
I'm a fan of yours ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
This USA team can be beat especially if they face a team with length and that can slow down their fast pace tempo.
🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
edwards looking like MJ here
I wonder what LeBronze thinks of this
Lonzo Ball could’ve led this team to a fun as time for all to watch with his defense and passing in open court. So sad.
Who's taking the ball in crunch time?
Wait this is our real USA Team this year?
Why so many fucking ads
Stark
Austin Reeves was the X-factor.
The hustle on defense. Wow!
Oh hell yeah we for sure winning gold this year 😮‍💨
Team USA 🇺🇸 has a team full of 5th streamers
WATCH THESE GAMES CLOSELY. WE MAY SEE SOME DUOS/TRIOS TRANSLATE BACK TO THE NBA in the future. SEE WHO LOVES PLAYING WITH EACHOTHER. 🔭
Man I love Austin Reeves. That guy will be a solid star for L.A. I love how he made USA team.
Geauxx tremont
Steve Kerr really had these youngins move without the ball..
Ant Man is going to show this tournament why he is the future of the NBA.
If they just lock up on D they are going to be problem for these other teams good win tho!!!
GREAT GREAT WIN BY THE #YOUNGBULLYZ🐂 THUS THE TERM, NBA #BULLYZISBALLIN BULLYZ IS BALL ..
there's not 1 puerto rican guy on the puerto rico team smh what?
You posted you can read this
Young guys with something to prove! I love this team!
These guys are in shape like me I'm ready hit it up
Νice game. Team USA were better than I expected. It's gonna be a good final between them and canada
United States 💪💪💪💪🏀
I would love to play for Puerto Rico or celebrity all-star game this year so yea vote for The Champ official Celebrity Boxing
Cam Johnson looks massive wth
Team USA, looks really young this year, but they’re still looking unbeatable if they can continue to play at this level
interesting to see when they play a veteran international squad
puerto rico is too small hzahahahaha
Y’all relax it’s just one game but yes this is a good team
Campeonato del mundo adulterado con tantas bajas en   muchas selecciones
America vs Australia will be nuts. Both teams have so much youth talent and future NBA stars, USA will win but I think the next 10 years between these two countries is gonna be 🔥
i like how they played USA vs USA (puerto rico) and make it seem like another country.
잉그램 피지컬 왜 저럼?? 벌크업 했나 다른 사람인줄..
Reaves was amazing
Ja got to get his shit together man smh
❤❤
Is Ingram got bigger? or I'm just not watching Pelicans games?
They look like OP 2k team lol real good start tho
Steve Kerr is a monster
7:00 Portis with the dream shake tongue out. Hes just having a great time. He deserves it.
This US team looks nice.  PR played good till mid3rd qtr and 4th qtr.
With all of the shooting and athleticism on this team, if we run the floor and make smart and timely cuts to the basket, I think we can wrap this thing up pretty quickly
Just needed @jamorant😂
Wow these guys as a collective team are beautiful to watch perfect basketball
It's a massacre lead from team USA
Waters is wet
Uffff like we say in PR que clase de salsa, impresive team
Team USA is better than the all star game
Banchero and Haliburton really stood out to me. Haliburton, I think everyone's already talking about how good he was in terms of playmaking, really showed why he's on another level. Banchero was also a blur, just felt like he was constantly in good position to use his athletic gifts to make an impact play.
Everyone switching up once they see them play, team is solid!
Nobody want to play for team USA anymore.
Haliburton is such a ridiculous playmaker it’s not even funny.
Zo so woulda been on this
Ant in #10! That fadeaway bank shot was beautiful!
Isn't Puerto Rico a part of the US..? Wait a minute lol. WTF
ALL THAT TALK ABOUT NOBODYS SHOWING YA SOMETHING 😂😭🤣🔥
They are MAD Fassssssssssssssssstttttt!!!! Damn
Tremont waters was such a bucket
Why does Banchero and Cam Johnson look so tall
The Suns gave up Cam Johnson, Mikal Bridges, 4 1st Rd picks for KD? Bad trade for the Suns.
Are y’all just Ignore that 🇵🇷 PG ???   A baller!!!
I’m impressed
Coach Kerr and Coach Cade 😎 got these boys 🔥 up
Banchero merda
The selflessness is refreshing
So basically it USA against USA cause PR is a part of the US they have US rights
Good start by team USA! I like how they recruited players that are role players. Pretty well balanced squad.
Refs were trash there were horrendous travels including switching pivots and taking 6 steps before dribbling
MY BACKCOURT WAITING 🍁
I'm more so interested in the line up adjustments against better competition
It’s crazy how good the world has gotten at basketball
Romero took 4 steps at the elbow.
Great team basketball from everyone. And shout out to Adam Amin on the call!!
we need jason tatum or fox on the team . we are gonn have trouble against france, spain, serbia, canada and Slovenia
BI finally not looking like a srick
Уничтожение
not gon lie i see a glimpse of KD when i saw ingram
Those sneakers squeaks are sure fake right? loll
Gotta wait until they play better teams to decide if this team is legit or not
if this team wins the world cup. might as well send the same team to the olympics
Austin Reeves the new Larry Bird for Team USA. White dude who has the full respect of all the brothers on the team.
This team so well balanced
https://youtu.be/kbftb0sgEcU🔥🔥 Lebron highschool highlights
puerto just needs to work on turn overs , great team
Nice young team! I’m excited for them!
Remember what KD said after winning Gold.. "OUR SKILLSET  IS UNMATCHED", there u have it!
i love this team ngl
😳 wow, do they look good
1:37 they never told us why 😕
Damn! The team so young and playing good basketball
paano mo tatapatan ang ganyang ka lakas na team😂.....uwian na may nanalo na🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Isn’t this technically Team USA vs Team USA?
Team C
ok but giannis would work these boys
Just so wholesome to watch the twins Mikal and Cam Johnson do so well. The valley misses you both
It should never be a game
Fuck that who 51 on Rico bruh was killing 😭😭😭
Play of the Game: Brandon Ingram close-out block / 3rd quarter 6:30 - ADesque??
Ant Edwards is a cheat code
Puerto Rico doing the gold vs. Invincible challenge in 2k
The hustle🙌🙌👏👏👏
di yan ubra kay choke
yall know its time for the youngins to star in the league now
God damn this team is special so much talent shooters every where they dont know who to guard
Team chemistry is nice and everyone eats since there’s no superstar and only all-star caliber players trying to showcase their talent
This USA team is good but not going to win it all with this lineup
Is that Bill Rafferty on the mic? Man, they are spoiling us big time!
Waters and Conditt are NBA level and they proved it 🇵🇷 good game US just to big and hella fast for their size great team 🇺🇸
Is Rico that good? Or the starters are that slow?
Try team Camada. You can not run like that or Spain or France
Exciting squad!
Good luck world.
Good start just wanna see how they fair when they play teams like Canada Argentina disciplined teams determined to beat USA that's when it gets interesting Go USA
And trea wonder why he ain’t make it he can’t play defense we not playing like that keep that shit on the hawks my guy
I feel some super teams gonna be formed from this Olympics run
This only proves Steve Kerr is a great coach
Can a puerto rican play for usa since puerto rico is technically part of the usa??
Triple j is a beast
Really thought BI was KD for the first minute of the video #7
Man I remember USA beatin GB everyone by 60.. we fell off y’all  Like tonight this game would had been a 55 to 60 points win.   LeBron, Kobe, DWade, Mello. That team was nasty af. DWade was probably the best player that summer. True beast.
They won’t lose as long as they just try the whole game. Blow everyone out!
Boston should of kept waters.
USA WILL WIN THE WORLD CUP TOO STRONG HALF THEIR S1ST CHOICE TEAM ISNT PLAYING AND STILL WOULD MOP OPPONENTS!
All the old USA teams woulda had a 25 point lead at halftime 🥱
can someone explain to me why the dude from PR from the thumbnail looks like the bangbros porn dude, the one with the dumbass face lol
미쳤다 미국
That boy haliburton was HOOPIN 😭
Watched this cause of AR❤
Gilbert that comment aged like SOUR MILK!!!!🤦🏿‍♂️
Reaves reminds me of Kyrie when he plays point
nah! quarterfinals only for this team
stacked
Austin need to ride this wave
FOH y'all just giants 😒 tall ass american people 😒
Love rhe connection between Haliburton and cam , thats the perfect sf pacers needed
Jerret
BI really looks like KD
They really got that chemistry down pat. Guarantee the gold if they play like this.
Que paliza nos dieron cb 😐
that boy tyrese was out there DISTRIBUTING 😵‍💫
is it just me or did Ingram grew taller?  for a second i thought he was durant on the court?
Let's go USA
I didn't recognize Brandon Ingram at 1st looks like he's put on some muscle.
this team young fast and play hard, and great chemistry, they going FARRR
2nd place vs 20th place or something like that right?
Great game I’m just confused on my Puerto Rico has its own team when it’s a part of the USA.
Much better haliburton for firts five
This is legit the Warriors' system 😂
Looking 💯
Am i bugging or is their camera shuttering a little bit to much? You would expect the cameras in the NBA to have high performance cameras that dont stutter especially during a transition play!!
Smoking Puerto Rican pack
Not until we face Sweden. Oh wait… 😂😂😂
shouldn't puerto rico be a part of team usa? this makes as much sense as usa vs california
Where is Kyle kuzma
Man them boys was cooking out there ! Great Chemistry no egos clashing jus great basketball 👏🏾
I’m conflicted
This is USA basketball turn me up
Team Philippines could beat this USA line up.
Aint see Lebron, where is he?
Id rather choose duncan robinson than reeves.
Yeah this team is gonna be good. I've seen so many people hating on this team. "Where's the superstars? Who are these guys? Weakest team USA ever." Only CASUALS think that this team isn't good. We have future superstars and unselfish young guys who know how to make the right plays. Another Gold medal incoming
They look like they already have great chemistry.
4:07 that’s Austin Reeves’ mom for sure
This just got me hyped
Bro traveled! Carried! All in one at 1:40. Guess in the NBA they starting to have no eyes lol.
Cam Johnson looked very good lot of nice plays
I love this team. So many good players without the oversized egos. USA! USA! USA!
Ooooops, the haters and the doubters might be starting to go hiding. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 These young stars will be the future of the league. Don't count them out. 👊🏽
They have a dream team coaching staff they should be able to win gold 🥇
Easy wrk
This team would get destroyed by veteran European team who has experience on world stage.....
Be honest, is this a Kessler assist? 9:15
Haliburton's perfect for the Kerr system
If this team is anything its athletic. These are not the best players but the mix is good. just a little weak in the center spot. Crazy how that 2004 team had better players but this team is better because the balance is better.
I like how this team play, and not focused on stardom that NBA has.  FAST PACED, TEAM CHEMISTRY , RELENTLESS.  So underrated. Very entertaining to watch.
Where is everyone that said the US was “mid”? Y’all were saying this team is ass, wya?!?🤔
1:34 not a travel? The rotation of the ball stopped.
Puerto Rico sigue siendo tremenda porqueria. Que clase bochorno.
Dude you can just play a ball with USA, Puerto Rico could have win this but there defense is killing them ...
Reaves Need to be in the starting line up He's the only one With High play IQ 💯💯✅💛💜
Man, I love watching Edwards play. My favourite NBA guard behind Jamal Murray because I'm a homer lol
Goes to show how good the young talent really is. Cant wait till they play Canada
The old woman voice irritates me 😂
B.I WILL LEAD THIS TEAM!
All these guys are young and going to come out next year on some boosted confidence for sure. Exciting game!
FUN talented SQUAD! Young legs everywhere! The future is now old man. Ingram has his man body finally & Kessler needs more minutes. I thought he was Zubac at first then I thought he was Edey from Purdue. Edwards is the best player on USA. 🔥🔥🔥
@3:39  what a spectacular pass wow..
ingram gained weight
US ARMY🎉🎉🎉🎉
PROUD🎉❤
Where’s josh hart?
Haliburton is ridiculous
Props to the younger talent in the NBA! Beat down with the team chemistry goin!
Where are the Team USA haters now?😂😂😂
“This team sucks” knew they were gonna prove ya wrong, SO MUCH young talent! Crazy to see this team and not think they have a shot
@ team USA so unfair 💔..🔥
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Gg
I like this squad. Lots of defensive-minded guys, and they play off one another.  A good sign.
Dude this team is already working together better and playing like a team better than the Tokyo 2021 team ever did😂
I remember the Puerto Rican national basketball team used to look like a bunch of tall Iraqis.  Now the team looks like the Harlem Globetrotters.
Juwan Howard and Tremont Waters is a tufffff backcourt
They bout to get tore up by those European Countries lmao
Let’s go US!!!!
This is good lineup by team usa, young, hungry and wants to prove something. Given a good coach and a good system they can win it all in the fiba world cup
It’s exciting to watch these players play together and grow… future stars off the NBA in the making
I'm from Puerto Rico 🇵🇷  but I was going for USA from the jump soon as I saw the roster....
i like it
Did reeves bulk up? Shout out to his LA summer farmer’s tan 💪🏼
Knew this team would be solid first team gold bunch of hard workers with all stars and guys who can defend a bit!! 👏🏾
Put respect on cam Johnson’s name
Blowout but some nice plays by both teams great to see other teams other then the USA and Spain do good in basketball, even tho they lost they getting better
Yeah, they're getting cooked by those seasoned Euro squads. They had problems defending cats from PR Leagues and other semi-pro teams.
USA : the most privileged athletes on the planet. Lets start winning forreal.
Impressive. Like them running the floor.
Austin Reeves Representing for Lakers Nation
Lovin them young bulls, they’re having fun, and v competitive, the chemistry overall is awesome! Cant wait to see moreb
5:38 stupid foul call no?
Weak roster good for 3rd or 4th finish
Austain reavers is him
Without the controversies, this team would be unbeatable with Ja and Zion.
Flick that out of the rim Bobby!  @3:15     Americans forget its beer pong rules.
Knowing team USA is not anymore of the king of FIBA, i like it
Look like a bunch of clown laughing and dancing after every basket... Keep the same energy clowns
I’m a Celtics fan. And I can’t stop seeing this man Tremont waters everywhere! First he grows up near where I live. Then he plays for my Celtics. (No offense dude but I groaned every time you checked in) Then i see him everywhere playing with wemby. Now here!
Why does the Puerto Rican player in the thumbnail look like hes from NBA2K?
Philippines is still the best team in basketball
One game
Mikal bridges wingspan is hilariously wide. Bruh is a steals and defensive nightmare when into the game fr
As expected Team USA had to destroy Puerto Rico mercilessly, teams that are yet to play team USA should be worried
0:10 travel 01:38 carry
Its crazy to think usa have a roster full of superstars not competing this year. This is a young talented squad and they will have a tough time with the European teams and Australia but I reckon they got what it takes to get that gold 🥇
Bakit Yung Puerto Rico 15 man roster sila? Eh Yung team USA is 12 lang?
Dubs love the intensity
would love to see Team Canada and Team U.S.A square off
@1:36 travel muxh?
This U.S. team has tremendous energy and are very unselfish. Love to see this!
I swear this USA team is gonna be the root cause of a super team in the future 😂😂
The steal by Mikal Bridges at 1:44 is too nice 🌬
KD and draymond sitting together 😂
Austin Reaves gonna be 6th man best believe that
Edward is a dawg, Haliburton creates beautiful passes
I thought Puerto Rico was apart of America
Happy to see Ant Man starting now 💪 Brunson, Ant, Bridges, Ingram, and JJJ. Pretty slick with great depth obviously lol. Will Canada be able to compete?
I hope they get eliminated out by Vietnam. They don't deserve to win snubbing Trae Young. All he wants to do is play for his country and everybody hates on him for no reason.
Isn't Purto Rico part of the United States?
This young core are hungry and dogs, they will be fine
Tyrese so fun to watch
Puerto ricccccccooooo
Puerto Rico is part of the USA, shouldn't it be Puerto Rico vs rest?
This team is really well constructed. Great chemistry, no heroes just there to have fun and get the job done.
See YOU ALL IN MY HOME COUNTRY ✌️😁 HOPE TO SEE BRUNSON IN PERSON 🙏😁  COME ALL TO MANILA PHILIPPINES NOW 😅😅😅
bronze medal team again 😂
Como un país tiene dos equipos ?
Great Basketball idk how else to describe it they played as a team
I’m here to See Isaiah Pineiro. Huge Fan🔥🙌🏿
So refreshing to see after us women's soccer team got eliminated
Not bad USA B TEAM
Pabalo need more mins
Lets go!
Woww this US team is really refreshing ! I love it ! 🖤❤️
You can say that Puerto Rico is not a good team but in 2021 the Olympic winning Gold Medal Team lost a game against Nigeria so it's a good start. The next 4 friendlies (Germany, Greece, Slovenia & Spain) are all going to be against contenders so they will be tested before the actual tournament.
Dominated, as usual.
Just Warriors things, Keep moving without the ball
Somewhere down the line, Puerto Rico should either be allowed to be our 51st state or we should allow them to become their own nation. Enough of this nonsense.
Handled business 🔥
Bro I swear to god liteskins takin ovaaaa
Ingram put on some muscle
When will y'all learn to stop overacting to one game🤦🏾‍♂️😂 USA looked good tonight but Puerto Rico not real comp tbh the real first test will be against Luka and Slovenia
Nice exhibition game of bout teams
Anthonys barber needs to be arrested and why the puerto rican dude in the thumbnail look like fenix flexin
Thought PR was part of the USA!!!!
Puerto Rico vs. U.S.A.? Looks more like Africa vs. Africa.
Wait so the USA is playing itself.? USA owns Puerto Rico lol.
Edwards and bridges on defense is scary
1.37... 1 dribble and at least 3 steps... where is the ref?
Pro vs amateurs.
WELL, THIS GAME WAS SIMPLY A REMINDER THAT IF YOU PLAY WITH FIRE, YOU WILL GET BURN.  PUERTO RICO INSTEAD OF HAVING A BETTER PLAN,  WANTED TO PLAY THE SAME STYLE BASKETBALL AS THE US WHEN EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THIS IS THE STRENGTH OF THE US FOR YEARS.  YOU CAN'T PLAY THE RUN AND GUN GAME AGAINST THE COUNTRY WHO INVENTED IT...  BUT UNFORTUNATELY COACHES WANT TO CONTINUE PLAYING THIS SAME STYLE OF PLAY INSTEAD OF HAVING A GAME PLAN THAT LIMITS THE RUN AND GUN GAME OF THE US WHICH IS WHERE THEY ARE UNBEATABLE AND DEADLY.  OH WELL...
legalmente Puerto Rico aguanto mucho porque USA llevo a puros perros de caza🥶🥶🥶
Steve Kerr is unleashing the young guy’s talent. The NBA is going to be fun next season
PR ❣️💯
2:41 i know he made the shot. but that x-out and baseline stop by Cam should be shown by every coach. read the play. called the switch, and ran where he was needed. better shot won, but that’s great team defense.
Cam Johnson is so jacked I was mushing my brain thinking “who that Johnson?”
Puerto Rico isn’t competition!
Is it me or Brandon Ingram is looking like KD on the floor
The Dream team was stacked
Soo this is Puerto Rico, Philippines is no match in this team lol
Start Haliburton
Hold up, B.I is wearing no.7. It's a wrap!! Brandon Ingram's Superstar Arc starting this summer.
They stayed on the move the whole game. Love the pace! Great job fellas!
So much talent on this team. This next generation is gonna be exciting to watch
Brandon Ingram looking more and more like KD
Serious question  How is Puerto Rico able to have an olympic team while not being an independent country AND US territory????
You will not win gold. This team gives me no hope
I’m really liking the younger players in their 20s. I think the NBA will be in better hands then we think.
JJJ 🐻🔥🔥🔥
I thought Brandon Ingram was KD when the video started lol
TRIP  <3
Laker nation in the house 💛💜💛💜💛💜💛💜💛
Reeves on Brookelyn would be crazy
bet the suns feel dumb giving up mikal bridges and cam johnson to rent KD for a couple of years.
Nice random Team fr😂😂
That dunk by edwards 1st quarter was nastyyyy
They play so fast on both ends of the court this team meshes so well
USA will win gold 🏅
6:03 “Go head Jordan”
ingram looking like kd with that 7
lot of unselfish players who all been showing big moments past few years. liking how they starting off
they are freakin versatile, they are long, quick, can switch all day and can lock down anybody
Bridges ,Austin, edwards csn get ,hot when
Jalen Brunson always entertains
Bridges ,Austin, edwards when hot can shoot like motherfuxker.
Brunson 12 rebounds always entertained
I can't believe how far Austin Reaves have become. He's one of the best young players now and he's also a down to Earth person. The Lakers are so lucky to have him as undrafted
You see, usually the teams have not much problems in the first half. The problems come in the second half, and the key component is ‘stamina’. You can see they move and react much slower defensively. Whereas the USA still has so much left in the tank.
USA!
Saucetin Reaves cooked first half
If they run they'll be hard to beat
Austin Reaves will be exposed this season, he will be a flash in the pan when teams are actually scouting him. This is just a preview.
They Bussed They Ass 🎉
😅
Isn't Puerto Rico part of the USA?? So this is basically USA versus USA😂
I believe this team will surprise the US and the world for that matter. Especially when the Olympics come around for sure.
gssssa
This team seems better put together than previous World Cup teams. Fun to see how they do.
This team is very fun to watch! Hustle and defense was something else. Also, am i the only want who want tyrese to start?? The offense just flow smooth when he's on the floor.
A Puerto Rico lo cogieron como gallo de Traqueo jajaja
B.Ingram wearing #7 looking like KD
No superstars but all of them have hearts to play basketball.. and aggressive to defend and get the ball..  Edwards and Ingram should learn to rotate the ball..
Solid
I hope it can translate to actually win their 6th title
3:14. Bro literally traveled
USA USA USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Tyrese started a little slow but when they picked up the pace, he picked picked the defense apart with his passing.
This is called representing your country.
They running the floor like crazy their tempo is impressive this is going to be a good team
Told people they were going to be better than last usa fiba team, even though it’s only an exhibition game. You can tell the chemistry is already there and going to get better. Last team was to selfish and wanted to iso to much
USA 🎉
That Bridges and Edwards trap a killer
This is the team everybody said their highest placing would be 7th? yeah ok
Ppl really thought this team wouldn't be good smh. The talent level in the NBA rn is at an all time high
Woohoo USA
Such a nice team win. Everyone doing their thing, I loved it!
Love the ball movement
Tremont Waters is so tuff I been watching buddy since college fr 🏀🤌🏽
Hopefully the bigs take advantage of the fiba rules
Reality ...usa💪💪💪👏👏👏👏
Anthony edwards knees and legs got him looking like jordan they are related some how
They can still win the gold, Spain has no Rubio, Croatia has no Jokic, France has Gobert :D
