There’s a really cool secret in this biome ain’t telling you what though
it would be cool if there was a bandit camp with outlaw traps. not say that its bad that there 0 of those its just a sugestion any way ye haw🤠
You’ve played a lot of red dead redemption 2 to get this Inspiration
Can you give me  your  world  🌎 🍁🌲🌳🍂🪴🍀🌱☘️🌿⚘️🌷🌾🌼🌵🌻🌴🍃🦋💐🌸🏵💮🌹🥀🌺
Now this is what badlands villages should look like. Wild west themed, not red recolours of desert villages.
The trains were my favourite part
This took 2 years to release
**builds a covered wagon**  I built a stagecoach...
I just want to know what types of buildings you put at the mines section
you should make a subtle modpack to go along with the world, with stuff like spartan weapons, and maybe something to create an actual in game quest line
Comment
giving your heart to Jesus is the best decision that can ever be made. i can assure and promise you that if anything 🧡
great rp map
I can’t believe this video is 2 years old
Please make more!
I’m the first comment in 4 months
You are by far the best builder in Minecraft. By far
🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
my jaw dropped, I was speechless. it is beautiful
plis you dowland maps
What minecraft will this be released on java, bedrock or normal
13:21. Did this so I don't have to scour the whole video for the deep music.
You should add a railroad that goes around the whole island otherwise very good work. Sad it takes money to join the world but I know u need it.
Where is the coal through to power up the stemm trains.
Если используете мод "create", то сможете оживить ваши постройки, и даже сделать ездящий поезд. Мне кажется что это будет выглядеть очень круто!
‘I think these finishing touches really bring a build to life’  The gallows: 🧍‍♂️
So, you are beautiful.. 😉 And I am boy yeah, and what bad?
IF your looking for more USW content ive just started a survival series on my channel! it would mean the world if you could check it out! enjoy ^ _^
Maybe you could one of those East Asian spiritualist, and polytheistic places of worship. Like Taoist, Shinto, and also Native American Style polytheistic rebellions too. (idk what places of worship those would end up being, but still). Also some random warring tribes with like 5 buildings and a small temple would be cool. And a Japanese shinto village on the water would be cool!!!
4:47 that looks like the saloon from dead by daylight ?
you need to make an Indian village 🥺
oh my god, it´s amazing how you build all of this, you have my respect man keep going your doing great! it´s looking fie and can´t wait to play it in survival
Will biome custom mobs still be spawning though
This kinda reminds me of genshin impact
I love the Red Dead Redemption vibe it gives!!!
Yes, that is indeed a minecraft.
I don't even like Minecraft but this is just awesome
Copious amounts of whipping
The first YouTuber that actually know his history
This is a f*cking movie.Somebody conntact Netflix
How do you play the map
BRO ITS 2022 RIGHT NOW
Imagine if it didn't save😮
3:17 "WE S"
5:58 no Stables???
You could make a modpack to make this all work
Overview 13:21
“Our outlaws definitely need a drink after all that looting and pillaging” TrixyBlox December 2021
The wild west village is awesome
USW sounds like a country innate of itself. “United Survival World” Instead of  “Ultimate Survival World” Maybe it’s just me though.
This makes me think of Red dead redemption when you go to Mexico
You should’ve made a dam! It would’ve been cool
Who else noticed he uses the word tackle a lot 😂
Wow 😳
i came late, but thios biome is missing the create mod, driving the trains for real, and real working cranes, that would be amazing
Red Dead Redemption Cube
YEEEEHAA we in the WILD WEST
I would’ve based the Wild West town after Read dead redemption two. I love the world so far!
The Railroad coupled with the create mod (and create trains) will be absolutely great
Mindblowing.
That is Red Dead redemption 2 reference? :)
Someone give me the ID PLS
I can't wait to replace the railroad with a Create train! :)
Sorry but the bridges don’t look western at all :/
bro how are you building so beautifully ?????
Anyone else get Red Dead Redemption vibes from this?
My favorite I love the Wild West and it’s aesthetic this reminded me so much of spirit (a movie on peacock)  which is one of my favorite movies so I loved this one
Omg this is like crash town from yu gi oh 5Ds. This is awesome
I like your gf's minecraft skin haha
Theres no swamp
This map deserves either a film series, book series, it's own game or all of those 😂
Can you please make me a ultiment zoo
Try adding custom mods like, custom villagers and trades. And custom monsters to fit each unique biome. Especially the underwater temple. Adding new mobs will make it more unique and alive. If you could try working with a modder to add more minor details like working wheels and trains. etc.
Hi Trixy! I want to start coding and be just like you, I have been following your story for a long time but suddenly found out there are more episodes! What software do you use or what software you think I should use as a “wannabe” (I’m under the age of 15)
Minecraft desperately needs a Wild Wild West update
I think I would be cool if you redesigned the pillagers to look like bandits and outlaws! You cool even make a big side quest where you have to defeat a king bandit or something hiding in the network and steal his valuables to give them to the villagers who inhabit the Wild West town. And there could be a special reward for giving them the ores! (That’s just an idea though. Who knows what will happen in the final map?)
Dude... This is insane but....  ARE YOU OK?  SERIOUSLY.
thanks for the inspiration
love the build so far, btw ppl who make leather are called tanners
builder god
In 2150. I was in wild west forever
This biome with the create mod wuld be incredible
Will this be available on ps5?
The fact that hes doing the nether and the end gets me so hyped up, cant wait for final product!
Living in the area where the gold rush happened, this feels really special and accurate. The wagons were usually used to get miners down to the mines from a much bigger city. Steamboats were also a common way to get down in the area.
Bro give download link of map
Did u get inspiration from rdr2
I'd LOVE to see a HUGE maze
Where is the stable? I’m pretty sure cowboys did walk everywhere.
A nice addition would be a derailed train that has been raided by outlaws when it was transporting important goods
This will be fun to explore
I’m sorry to be that guy, and I wouldn’t care if you didn’t say it for EVERY other culture, but where is the “this isn’t supposed to be accurate to blah blah blah”? Does it just not apply to the Wild West, but every other past of cultures and areas it does matter?
Incrível! Uma obra de arte esses biomas 🥰
we need a caboose
obsessed 🤩
Y that is club penguin
Ok
I can't wait to playt this USW with my cousins and brother this will be a blast good job Trixyblox I wonder how will I find the secrets of this USW
It's very f*cing best
He finally started taking care of his teeth 🦷
if i got the map i will build an SteamPunk armored train go all around the map and transporting military and civile stuff for all the village
You picked some kick-ass music to show us the final product! Suited it perfectly.
this is my favourite episode of USW
Please include an Elves city almost like Dubai
😦
It’s crazy remembering that this is still Minecraft you and steph make it look so beautiful
the wild west, i have recently discovered, was actually quite hygenic and culturally diverse
I noticed youre missing a stable in your town. Any reason for that?
You could make the cold village like legend of Zelda : Breath of the wild's Rito village
POV: when you want to build a house but Trixyblox just made it for you
Super cool idea could be that in jail there will be a chest with some keys for another structers for example key to some temple for another biome
Is the map on pocket 🤔
Dude you forget the sceriff  for the Wild west city
Me can’t wait till the end and nether
the only thing im missing is a horse stable :) since there are so many horses scattered around in the towns i feel like they need a home too
Actually steam trains are powered from water wood coal and fire
Make it free
What if you have a floating island in one of the biomes just idea I just farted farted look cool and to be honest I feel like a floating island would fit for any of the biomes
You never did a general’s store
Can i do it in bedrock like to get the map on bedrock edition
this is one of my favorite parts of the world. Beautiful, yet sad time.
So can it be played on bedrock
So how'd you spend your pandemic Tristan?
thanks
I thought there'd also be cattle and horse ranches scattered about the frontier to fill some of that neutral space
2:44 "Many many hours of tweaking" 🤨📸
it would be cool if you made the mining town in the mountains from rdr2
my little brother dose not suport how hard you worked on this😡😡😡😡
Club penguin
this cactuses are the cutest!!^-^
Totally gonna spend my money on this. No matter what my parents say. This is the best thing I’ve ever seen.
This is one of my favourite transformed biomes yet!
Somenone needs to make a FTB modpack to play alongside this
What about stables for the horse's
duuuude please make a tutorial vid on that train i’d love to just have it in my world✌️
I am loving the music in this episode! <3
imagine doing this without world edit
I wonder of you make the train run
Stables would have been a cool addition to the wild west town, or some kind of place to leave your horse to rest, horses seemed to have been a very common thing connected to wild west anything!
It looks great visually! I can't wait to play the completed map. If you're going for immersion, though, there's a few things you'll need to make it believable that this is a lived in town. You'll need a schoolhouse, a town hall for government and judicial proceedings (a place and people to decide the laws and judge the accused in jail) and the town meetings; and a stable bedside the blacksmith for all the animals needed to move and feed the people. It's beside the blacksmith for ferrier services (the one to trim and care for hooves and shoe them). Animals typically turn the cranks to lift  loads up and down the cliff faces. They can also work the mill when there's intermittent wind or lacking a water wheel (even with a water wheel then the stream/river is low). Otherwise, I don't see a food source for the people. Grain and hay needed for the animals, and I assume the people aren't carnivores, so some for them as well nearby. People will never set down roots in a place that can't sustain them. Old West towns always had nearby farms. You can't assume a saloon depends 100% on trade; if it's as old as it looks to be, they'll have a distillery, for which one requires grain at least. Don't forget a few town wells to water everything and everyone. Those will be nice touches for realism.  There are different types of deserts. In SoCal, I grew up surrounded by chaparral deserts. There's lots of dry mesic chaparral all up and down CA. If there's enough water for chaparral, you can grow crops if you irritate well. I used to eat the sour wine grapes of long-neglected vineyards and enjoyed near-wild citrus fruits.
For one of the snowy biomes, you should build a 13th century viking stave church. They look really, really cool and would fit the vibe really well.
when this releases dream has to do a manhunt on it
Just wait 4 the outlaws to find out there is gold in the nether
POV: You saw the Wild Western Town Me: *playing the Wild West OST of PvZ 2 on my mind*
Ok but imagine this world but replace the world with the Minecraft story mode music
Anyone else think that the USW should have factions
This map almost deserves it's own game at this point. It will still feel a lot like vanilla survival tho, except you rely much more heavily on loot chests.
this man is legend of builder
Can we talk about how he's taking inspiration from many different cultures and religions? I love it.
Is it java
God those tussle bridges are just so good. 10 out of 10 my favorite thing so far. They just look amazing
8:38 how they build In the air and move it under the train entirelllyyy?
OMG
You should’ve made part of the track destroyed by the jungle people and a ruined train at the bottom of the canyon
Can you make a large city pls 👀🥰🥺
Cool video bro!!! Can I use this "Wild west town with railroads map" for my game??? (It's a werstren style game)
I think that this episode is my most favorite of all the ultimate survival world series. Idk why but I am really liking the "Wild west town" "Western railroads" themed games (mabe cauz I'm making such a themed game... ) like mabe that's why I like this episode the most cauz it's the "western themed game" I like ur videos... 😃😃
I'm also beginning to realize that the sheriff and the town's outlaws don't have their casual revolvers and lassos, so they will have to resort to bows, crossbows, and leads.
keep your vlog going and don't give up 😊😊😊👍👍👍
If only there was a secret onion farm on top of one of those thumb shaped mountains 🤭
This project will be finished by 2023 maybe
I really want mojang to add wild west town in minecraft
This is a certified Yeehaw moment
Can you play in creative
We should make a mod specifically for this map that has mobs for the caves , pirates for the ship and bandits for the town and make them actually hard
@dv
DV tenchi
You could have made a general store instead of the tool smith like in rdr2 or something
yall so negative, you think he does this all for money? he does this for our enjoyment. Quit being NEGATIVE.
14:30
Haha
03:18
Is it just me or should Minecraft builders be hired by movie studios for world building
what program does he use for the isometric renders?
even theres a ocean cloud
i think 3 more biomes are not created but by the way i am excited
Nana
im losing confidence in my dirt hut
Me building dirt houses you:
Do i have to pay to get the map if not where do i download it
this biome is my favorite one so far !
Amaizing work, well done !
Instead of a hotel, there should be a inn
The people of this biome feel like they are the most powerful faction in USW.
The USW, the United States of Wuh
I accidentally said a swear word infront of my parents whrn i saw the train tracks
Your buliding is amazing and i abselutly love it...but i have a question...was tye wild west town time zone the same as the jungle temple time zone....?idk hisyory that much and i know these aren't soppsed to be that accurate to the actually history but i just wanna know
Oooooo my god you are a beast
Your  Best Bilder
2:18
Idk if this is possible but something I would love to see is make skeletons look like bandits, and their arrow would be replaced with like a gun or something. They would spawn in the mining places or around the Mesa biome
Kind of upset he didn’t add a drugstore to the Wild West town..
i have a few complaints. one, you did a train, it should've been a metro, two, you copied club penguin! awful! you even copied the wagons from the main town! truly despicable.
Are you redoing the nether and the end
Love when at least 15 percent of the video is the into and advertising, intro is longer than 2 minutes xD
Why does it take 2:20 just to start the actual video Tho love the content
Can you release the WorldPainter version because me and my friends want to build the building our selves
You should make a railroad all across the USW
where is the the hamburger shop ;(
Town raiding players better be wary of the sheriff in town.
Does the mineshaft from the mesa biom connect to the jungle? If not, then it would be cool to do that as a way to travel across the map and explore.
Make the nether like hell
Imagin a factions server made out of the finished map
This is definitely my favorite biome. I was always fascinated by the Wild West, and this is a great representation.
me and my brother want to see a mosque
Nice map but you kinda ruined the timeline, how are some places still midevil while the mesa is in like in the 1800's , all maps are closely connected so the other towns would have caught on by now right?
So beautiful
Steam trains don't just run on water they also need coad or wood or oil
I like how he doesn’t just build but also adds history that helped me with my school report
this comment is for the Youtube Algorhythm
mfs still got the audacity to say “this town ain’t big enough for the two of us..”
I think your choice for decorations, focusing on the PRACTICALITY of it, logistics, and having a good reason for why each thing is there, makes the build come together even better! you're doing fantastically!
If this comes out can someone make a video on this? I don't have the luxury of a pc to play the map and wanna see the story
That Saloon looks like it may be based off of “Dead Dawg Saloon” from dead by daylight?
PLEASE MAKE THIS FREE.
awesome
when it is coming out
"Since this is survival friendly, and on a relatively small scale-" I'm sorry SMALL??/?
Y'know you should add... hell
Can you include indian culture to please
YOU FORGOT THE HORSES :((((((((( still really good tho
genius
clock tower??????????/
Does it work in Minecraft education
Love the fact that he put so much effort into this. Keep it up!
This is truly one of the coolest things to come out of 2021
You should add a mod/add-on that makes the villagers look like cowboys, and instead of trading with emeralds they trade with gold
Spruce&birch Forests?
When trixyblocks decides to leave out some details so players find it themselves . I don't have minecraft so I miss out a lot 😥
i dont know if he’s already done it or plans on doing it but i think something cool to add would be the ocean monument since hes rebuilding all the main buildings of biomes,
Do all the people live in the hotel?
why are you british
My favorite biome so far. Add more to the other train stations though. The one at the end own is good but add more
Call the hotel an inn
Once I get a PC I will play this
Make a ghast nest in the nether
Will this be available on bedrock?
and horse/mule trails to get up and down canyons where the mines were
i could be speaking too quick before the video is over but scattered cattle and sheep ranches would work out well as well and horse ranches sometimes hunting / slaughter seasons got so bad horse meat was absolutely a thing nowadays  its illegal in all 50 states but still commonly used south of the border
you need to go back and make a bath house, most houses didnt have a bath because of how poor mining communities were and alot of people lived in tents only the 2-3 bosses did and these tents housed more than just one person in it sometimes a whole family. alot i hate to say it but your missing the biggest thing in a western town the saloon was normally half saloon half hotel and the hotel was also home to the whore house and the ladies there lived in the rooms while working at night sharing rooms with their customers if they could or were allowed again though colored women including "savages" were not allowed to sleep there and would also sleep in the muddy areas where the tents were set up for the rail road workers. it is sad how life was then but it was true
Nice
a budist
Imagine doing a Wynncraft type thing on this map oh my god
cant wait for releasy
If only mojang could do this
wait can this work on bedrock- IPad
this is would be exciting if some minecraft animators make a movie in this map
i would really like a druid grove for a place of worship, could be cool
That is insane i just love how you did the mesa perfectly ( i was always a big fan of cowbys and the western)     thats great work  keep it up 👍.   btw whats the music at the end of the video??
Mojang good should hire this guy for world generation
I can’t wait for this map to come out so I can craft a mod pack for it
I'd LOVE to see some gamers like DanTDM play this map!
This slaps
Ngl it took me a good five minutes to figure out what you meant by USW, my best guess is underground savanna world
bro’s is making us pay to play nah bruh LLLL
i just wish that this would be free on the store   for bedrock players when its done
U need clocktower in wild west they duel and they use clocktower
What's the music used at the ending...??
Snowy Mountains please 🥺😭
You should add the stronghold, the underground kingdom and Dracula's mansion. Please pretty please
im starting to LOVE this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait to play this world when its complete
quick question, why do builders always use sand when terraforming?
If i had a penny every time he places a block. I’d be rich
Can you give me the copy of the whole serwer pls?
So much care put into this! Incredible
Imagine flying from the snowy mountains to the massia biome
totaly worthit
How can i download this world?
Please join hermit craft🙏🙏
"Welcome to Utah F*ckers."
"Welcome to Utah F*ckers."
Could you do a secret cult cave in the mountains?
For the nether can you make it like a destroyed fortress sinking in the lava as a “new order” thing takes over?
Step Block im’ stuck
you might as well have made the next grand canyon lol when i seen the result of the terriforming i was seeing the grand canyon in minecraft even tho ive never seen it
S
GET A REAL JOB YOU FREAK !!!!! !! ! ! Sorry haha muy friend darred me to say that hehehe
The nether is gonna be so amazing
Ik you probably won't but maybe add a exploded railway, since in some ww movies they explode the railways- And you could also add a crashed train-
petition for TB to join Hermit Craft plzzzzz
This episode gives far cry 5 vibes
Yo im trying to find the songs but they arent coming up
this reminds me of one the sg maps on the old legacy edition
dude ur fucking insane. and i love it
10:11
I remember being in love w Minecraft adventures/ worlds w a story so I’m grateful that you’re able to bring that back
Can you do on bedrock edition pls
I do have an idea for you to do, add characters that interact with you and can do certain things so like for example, in the town have gunfighters fighting and other things like that
EPIC
I've just realised that this map was started in pre-caves and cliffs. Are you going to be updating the lower sections of each chunk to allow for the negative depths (deepslate layer)?
this is definitely my favorite biome so far!
how do you get your thumbnails to look like toys? is it just after effects or is there some sort of shader that does it?
jak zaczniesz dawac linki do pobrania mapy za darmo bedziesz zaslugiwal na subskrybcje i  wszystko inne ode mnie :)
You forgot the mayors house
This is amazing! How have i never seen this before?
Imagine if this dude could do this in real lif
You have built the cross
Please let us get this on console or mobile some how please it's so fucking good
My biggest question is does the tail road move
Bruh hes boutta upgrade the damn NETHER
Epic! I especially like the music =)
Pls make an Japanese themed biome
pls don´t make this map free! This just would be, eeeh, unfair? because of the lot of time you spend!
Can you add the npc people
This is so effing cool!!!!
Do you have a super computer? EVERYTHING MOVES SO SMOOTHLY WITHOUT A SINGLE LAG
This was my favorite even though it was quite short :/
r u going to up grade the end?  just an random question
Cool! Keep up the good work mate.
Just wow
Sup bois
this is sick i was wondering if you can add an end just like the normal game hut the end needs to look much cooler
Plz creat this bedrock also plz
We really need to do the snowy mountains after the savannah
for the Taiga biome I suggest an medical Russian village with a Russian Orthadorx church, that will be cool I belive
bruh you deserve more subs than this
This guy has one of the only patrons that I would find
I think this is all quite cool, but if you don't upgrade the other dimensions it could be a major failure of immersion.
how do i do masive projects like this without getting to bored and stopping half way through, i can barely make a boat i made a massive ship and i stopped once i got the frame made
Okay, but add guns and horses, then it’ll be perfect.
I kinda feel like he could have added a oil boom since oil was a very popular reason for moving out west I understand if they hadn't discovered oil at this time but it still would be a awesome idea
This is so sweet. I can't wait to play the full map.
This is really good. If I could make one suggestion, you should come back to this area and make a few stables around.
Can you, please, create Libertalia?
dont mean to be rude, but it looks like a larger versiom of Utah
Ha ha yeah cool. Now build it in survival :|
Hold on  Affordable clothing he says it’s like 25 quid I understand making a profit but Jesus
Will this be accessible to bedrock? I’ve been watching this series because it’s cool and I want to play it soon but I am unsure if I would be able to as a mobile player
I am in love with each new biome you create. You guys bring something new to the table with each area!
This map would be great when mixed with mods like create and maybe a new custom mod that creates npcs for the different biomes.
I have a question, how can I have access your this world in bedrock edition?
Anyone ready to do the train heist
to make it more survival friendly he could add maybe a hidden minecart track under the railroad that you can access from the train stations so you can actually quickly go from place to place.
Man it would be so cool to see the entire red dead redemption 2 map in minecraft. i love the town you made here
Make it free
Can you make the snowy biome with a ski lodge and a snowboarding lodge?
Minecraft should add trains to their game. I don't care if that means a small redstone locomotive that runs with the mine carts which could be connected but something would be nice. Minecraft should start being a bit more "modern" which isn't the correct term as the modern age didn't come till after the industrial revolution and ww1
I love the map and how you've built it with lore, but this is a warning, if it looks good that's great, but if the story sucks, people won't like it very mutch nomatter how it looks,
I would Love to see something Like a Shaolin  Tempel
This should get more attention
I can't stop watching your builds! I wish there was an infinite episode where I can watch you build these beautiful structures for hours.
When building the town in the mesa, know that;   People actually used to build the front of structures taller than the back so it looks bigger.
You should make coustom vilaggers  Sorry if i spell evrything bad im grom Poland :)
this nigga wild
When you around to the snow mountains,   Can you try to make a viking fortress?
Broo! As someone from the American Southwest, you definitely did is justice with this one! It's wild! Good job partner!
Don't get me wrong. I think these builds are very cool and genius. But that being said, how would this midwestern town fit in with a story line that has prehistoric civilizations in it.
whats the western beat called?
This gives me hard steel ball run vibes n I love it
you need a nether transformation. thier culture could be satanism. plus there is a nether portal in the world.
e o nether?
I got an idea for the nether... their culture will be satanism.
Once it comes out are we going to have to pay?
This isnt survival friendly at all. How the hell am I supposed to break a single block not feeling like an awful person?! This shit too pretty man😭✊ great work as always!
ngl it’s looking epic so far
Oh my God everyone of your builds are so detailed. Makes me question if this is even minecraft anymore!!
we need mini bosses.
I had a question will there be npc’s that u can talk to and communicate with in This
The place of warship in the savanna should be a pylon from Greece
imagine doing this without world edit.
I was just thinking you can make ships on the ocean. Because the mountains are on the shore. You can have a small dock with a few boats. For trading or for exploring further. I was also thinking you could make a hidden mjolnir somewhere
MEMES FOR DAY'S
For the snowy biom use a buddha style worship
You should add a little starting island where the player spawns on with a tiny house and farm and with a map to find the larger island so that there it's more immersed
frist
I'd like to see a mandir in the next biome.
I can all the famous hardcore Minecrafters playing on that map
I can't wait  to download  the world but how?
Hoping we get some scandinavian inspired snow biome in next vid :>  Maybe some sami inspired stuff too because the sami make up quite a big portion of northern scandinavia :0
the way im gonna have to learn how to beat the game and enchant things to be able to travel faster in this world lmao
The Mesa is by far my favorite It's so well done and has the most buildings and story
U missed the part where the western gather and breed animals like chickens, cows, and horses for food and transportation, and fortune.
You should callab with Daniel Kraft and refusing some mobs and weapons to get the ultimate experience
Did he made the wild west swing set
So excited to play this with my friends
So excited to play this with my friends
Roads that kinda connect the biomes More like a path way
Alternative meaning for USW : United States of the Wild
Very cool
this men needs to be in hermitcraft
Make a Hindu temple
revamp the mineshaft pls
Oh yeah when you finish this survival world make a full video all part of this is in there rigth
Make it free trixy blox or not if you dont want
GOD FUCKING DAMN im loving how this is going, i wonder if this world could use a place with no places of worship, like using the lack of one shows a place of death and isolation. IE the snowey mountains, you could use this lack of faith to twist the theme to horror for a bit gameplay wise. <3 keep this shit up <3
this is so sick, very cool
Will you upgrade the nether and the end? Cuz i think that would be really cool
love the vibe again dude, keep it up! ;)
It's really more of a cow splatter-er than a cow catcher.
I fell asleep to the ads in the beginning, now I woke up to a finiahed vid :/
💀
when will USW be open to the public?
One day. This map gonna be 1 of the legendary and best map ever.
Gosh that train and bridge just looks so amazing
As an artist, lemme just give you a 10min clap and respecting your amazing designs and hardwork!
Usually the jail is part of the sheriff's office..
This is not an upgrade because you cannot compare the before and after it’s like a whole new game at this point
I feel like the mesa village shouldn’t be the most developed. Like it’s the Wild West. In our world it was small towns while in the east there were already massive urban areas. I feel like the plains biome should have a more developed community. Maybe it’s just the massive railroads that confused me. The railroads were developed going westward, they weren’t created in the west. Of course this isn’t real world this is Minecraft I just think the Mesa  is too developed while the rest of the world is not
big question wilk you consider making caves modified
I'm hoping to see lots of caves, lava/water pockets scattered in the ground. No details needed just to keep it consistent and sustainable as a survival world. It would also be nice to see one off structures like a single random small house, camps, huts, occupied cave home's, and other structures to breath life to the living world of travelers, scavengers, and merchants. Also I'd like to see a primary nether portal and stronghold for future plans for a neather overhaul DLC in the form of a file to replace the world's nether with one you may release later on for continuous supporters and an end overhaul in the same way in the form of releasing a DIM-1 file for the replacement of the nether and a DIM1 file to replace the End with an overhaul DLC later on. And have it connected to the stronghold and a pre set nether portal in this USW.
Love your vids there so good I feel like you are the best Minecraft YouTuber!
Ahhh reminds me of home 😌 You did an AMAZING job it looks beautiful and it gives off that perfect Wild West vibe :D
take a shot every time he says "tackle"
This is by far my favourite one so far

A hindu temple would be so good
Can I download the world?? If so PLEASE SEND ME THE LINK and a video on how to insert the world to bedrock and education/ Also how did you make a map like that????
I’d love to see a mod that replaces the vanilla structures with these in the game’s generation system.  Especially if it is compatible with terralith 2.0.
can you make a star wars  reference
When is the nether and end coming
I can't wait for the map to come out
I might be late, but I'm just excited and sad that this is gonna be for people, But I will never get to use it lol
Dudeeee do I want this guy to do a Genshin building. Imagine Tenshukaku!!
The only suggestion I have for this entire series so far is making the railroad somehow rideable with minecarts. Otherwise, great job! This is my favorite biome so far.
Is this world available for bedrock edition trixy?
Your building is so amazing you should join hermit craft season nine
Are you gonna continue your work on the underwater kingdom or not? Because last video you said it should get 150k likes for you to continue it but it still hasn’t reached that. Would be a real shame if you wouldn’t! It looks really interesting, definitely with those added ties it has to the underground kingdom
a volcano could be nice
will this be free?
add sharks into the waters!
Where can  I get the map... who needs to go to the end,when we cam sit and have fun exploring the world
Imagine if the trains were able to move that would be crazy!
Will ti's be for xbox,ps4 and switch?
You still have to do the snowy mountains and the spurce thingy, and in the snowy mountains you should add cabins and cottages
what mods do you guys think would work great with the map?
Trixy I have a challenge for you and a large build.I challenge you to attempt to build Eribore from the hobbit along with the city of dale.I really love the films of the hobbit and it should be a Good challenge for you since there is only a decent amount of vision in the movies.I also really enjoy your brilliant videos that you upload,you are just such a talented person and in your videos you have such good passion.This is just a suggestion so you don’t have to work on it. I wish you the best in the future and hope you get to 3million and then to 10million subscribers .
I need that world pass it to me please
Getting Rango Vibes from this

Great project just wondering wouldn’t you also have a stables in the Wild West town
i seriously can’t wait for this to be done. vanilla minecraft is amazing of course but sometimes it just feels kinda empty
i cant wait forctgis to b3 teh3done. So cool
Will this be buyable on ps4 Minecraft store?
snowy mountians please
imagine having to make something like this block by block  youd have to sell ur soul to the gods of motivation or something
If you added real tracks underneath the rails and mine carts under the wheels then you could make it actually go around the tracks in circles.
In one of the snowy areas should be like a Japanese feeling cause it would be beautiful, Snowy blossom trees
Can you do the city of Erebor in the snowy mountains?
Can you upgrade Snowy mountains in next video?
Why you don't make the map free?
Any chance to get this on Xbox?🥺
What biom will be after savanna
Is this map will be in bedrock
Wbt a cow farm? Or a butcher
Use the immersive railroads mod for trains
Ummmmm were is stronghold pls built stronghold
are we able to download map if we buy pateron
This map can be modded?
You should implement this map with the create mod
IF NOTCH SEE THIS IDK WHAT HE SAY
I wish you could take southeast asian culture & architecture as an inspiration for your next build, maybe angkor wat or borobudur style temple for an ancient civilization like the jungle temple here
If Mojang Noticed Trixy and added a USW game mode they would make alot of money along with Trixy....Idk how they haven't noticed Trixy yet.
trix u quit?????????
amazing
Pls add Hindu temple
Can you add a mosque 🕌
can you please do the snowy mountains biome  next because thats what i am really looking forward to and am hoping its that biome in the next video
The taiga village should be based off of Nordic culture
You should do one part with a Greek theme I think that would be cool
Where do i get the world download? "I
For the ocean Greek gods, and in a corl reef/warm ocean
I am so looking forward to the cold biomes o/
fortnite
A big viking church about Valhalla.
a lost hlicopter spot it got crasht because of the blizzerds
Thanks a lot dude ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Will this g be e available on Xbox??
Man never posted again
when is this coming out
its nuce
Maybe you should have put oil pumps in the mines so coal and gold will not be the only things you can find
Does anyone know if this is going to be on console?
It just occurred to me, does he plan to do an Ocean Temple or Coral Reef? Or did he do that and I missed it like a dummy?
Plz in the snowy mountain put a snowy village based off the Harry Potter village
when is the next video planned? cant wait to see progress! im very excited
You can build a boat that goes to Tahiti!
Hey can you actually make a tutorial for this because your too godly at building and just speed up making it so can you actually make a whole video teaching us how you make it so if we can’t pay we can’t make our own pls it would really make me Feel good if you don’t I’ll just spend Years of looking at your builds and trying to make them and regret everything I’ve done
WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE COMINGGGGGG
build the snow and tiger biome
is this server going to be public because me and my friend just wants to play it in our own world. because we don't want people taking all the looting and messing up your creations~!
you say we have to look for ourselves of the interrior,but what about these that doesnt have minecraft?
This map doesnt work in android?
A cool idea would be to have plugins available for the map to have certain villagers with quests and dialog
This dude has more patience than my parents
it's very impressive that trixy spent this long to make something for us to enjoy
Can you please make a little biome like a cherry blossom forest?!
:]
Love it
Amazing
Are you also gonno change the end
Cant wait to git finishd
This man is a legendary builder.
I have a nice idea, we should add mods to the map and have different bosses in the diff biomes
Do an indian devastana (Indian Hindu temple). They are quite beautiful and will fit very well in the ultimate Survival world.
Can u put it on planetMinecraft pls
When you post this map again
mate youre looking at the moniter look into the camera
Forge labs should play this!!
I can not wait till this is released, I’m hoping it rekindles my friends and I’s love for the game and gives us new motivation to start up a SMP world
Stupid question, but is there any possible way you could put this world on the xbox minecraft marketplace?
I think some biomes should have atleast 3 to 5 villages some being large or small and civilized or war based (if you get what i mean)
А эту карту можно скачать?
Will it be free or paid
Dude this is incredible
he has not build even one barn
the crane may be bigger, but it lifts the same amount of things...why?
Can you make this able to be downloaded for free?
Htf doe you do it
link world please
next tiger
Can’t wait to play the finished version
I like that part where you added that broccoli.
i don't know about you guys, but i'd love to have the Pride Rock from The Lion King in the savanna biome
This looks absolutely amazing! Only thing I would change is the locomotives from this era would have had the lamp placed on top of the boiler (at the front) and where you currently have the lamp, there would be a disk that says the number. As for the bell it would be placed behind the smokestack. Sorry I just had to bring this up, amazing nonetheless!
Would this map lag on bedrock?
So how about the mountains this Village they didn’t know that’s
:00 i know im late but you sould realy make a greek temple somewhere. it would be verry nice :)
You should try to transform my house lol it would look amazing
is the map updated to 1.18?
You can get someone to help you to make a mod with special items and mobs for this world
Bro plz give world download link ❤️💖 when it will over I liked it so much I am excited for 💫🙏
Put pilagers in the village insted of villagers
I really hope to see some emperial Russia architecture in taiga. It will be interesting to look how you build church
That looks so insane. It would be awesome to see a hole Western project from you!💥
When is th new video
This awesome and you think you could have done this in survival if so how?
dude u worked so hard on this its worth a sub
Upgrade snowy tundra and taiga
you said its worth building... i say its worth watching all of these
Where can i download the original map Without the transformation?
maybe you should add like a stash of hidden diamond blocks gold blocks and other treasure for displaying how much they earned just from mining
You are the number one Minecraft builder
O:
playing this on a modpack would be nice
Part 5 Part 5, we want Part 5!
Why don't add boss for each zone and mini boss also
how to download this
do the snowy mountains next
Imagine this man became the CEO of Minecraft.
time to search for a cowboy skin
Please make a hindu temple  for your next biome
PLEASE ADD A VOLCANO INTO THE USW !!! Even in the snowy area to add a cool glow !!!!
We need hindu temples.    They'll fit the aesthetics very well.
Can you please unban me from your Discord? I was banned for posting a malicious link when I didn't even know what I was posting was a malicious link. I was told by someone on a Minecraft server to share the link on your Discord. I had no way of knowing it was malicious.
bro made buried from bo2
snow mautain
bro. BRO WHAT THE FUK HOW ARE U NOT LOSING MOTIVATION YOU HAVE TOO MUCH TIME
When is the next
Bro what if he adds new mobs?
I would have really liked it if you also buit a small farm in the savanna
I think you should work with modders to make this a sort of rpg with quests and lvls and different types of mobs and weapons and obviously a good story
AMAZING job, the build is incredible, keep it up !
Ok
How i download this map ?
Imagine mojang Upgrading entire Minecraft after watching this series😅
I plan on using the origins mod with this map and with friends its going to be really fun
will it be free?
Is this bedrock edition or java?
He’s probably gonna put The sledding thing from club penguin on the mountains
Is that the bite of 87?
Why does he only have eyelashes on one eye
If there isn’t a yeti in the mountains I’ll eat my family
I wanna get this island
I cant wait for you're new episode:)
Can you make towns in the nether???
bruh if i ever play on this map, my building will  be the ugliest building XD
In savana add a lion mob so it fells like a savana
For worship in the next biome  trixyblox can you try the golden temple in india?
you can build encanto house?
Some day I’d like to see you do some Asian architecture
do you think you can add the nether and the end to this world and upgrade those as well.  I think it would be a lot cooler if we could beat the game.
i got an idea: i wonder if you can find a resource pack or a mod that adds more varriety to the mobs and stuff like pillagers would look like bandits in the mesa or wolves turn to coyotes (or something like them idk) in the mesa
Hey trixy make the snowy village a viking village it will be perfect
Can you build the Berentein Bears treehouse home, with a complete interior?
I think he forgot to upgrade the cactus
All biome are great but this one thing on it like the crane or the train seem abnormally big  and disproportionate as on a model and not as in real life
love this series but how can u have a wild west town without a stable?!?
Great job with this! One question... is it big enough for the both of us?
Dude u are so good at building. U shuld join hermitcraft!!
I smell a underrated youtuber😄
Build a VIKING village🔥
Yo imagine how crazy it is playing this in hardcore
When's the next one Coming
Here's a suggestion:  Maybe for the snowy mountains, you can make a really insane plot. Something like a large city that got covered in spiked of ice and abandoned with some loot, inside, so basically like a huge Minecraft village with tons of ice spiked poking through houses and buildings to make a dramatic look. Thank you!  (This is just a suggestion, but you can reply to this comment with more ideas I'd love to hear-)
What is your shader
I am so hyped for when this all comes together. I can only imagine playing on this map with the create mod so that i could make the train actually drive along the tracks and making all the mechanisms actually work.
i love this guys buildings but i wish he did a close zoom in so we could see the mass amounts of detail he has put into this
i always thought the mesa needed more
Love all of this, the only thing I don’t is that the hotel should be called an Inn just to be a little more historically accurate considering u we’re going with colorful buildings due to historical accuracy. Keep up the good work, love this series
Trixy should've built like an oil pump or something, or some sort of big wild west plantation/manor.
If there’s not a delorean somewhere I want a refund
Mods should be added. It will make the story make more. Well sense.
Bro what about bedrock players
where will be able to find this world when its done?
You van make hogwarts
Really amazing man! You‘re properly good!
i have an ideea. when you are done with this world you should put a chest at the spawn with the map so you can see where you are going
the ultimate survival world aka the amogus
The best map Minecraft in the world
In your winter biome you should make a Viking Village for all the Norse mythology people who watch your video like me because the Viking lived in really cold weather it suits your story line as well
Tiaga
im pretty sure finishing this survival world is gonna kill him
Can you help my frend build a city we only have 2 days plz help
that’s crazy, keep it up bro 🔥🔥
I can't wait to see what the snowy tundra will hold. I think some cool and epic Nordic ruins buried high up in the mountains would be cool. Heck even a whole RPG style dungeon that burrows into the land would be cool there too
When it's done... We can play it in VR!
is this map be for money?
Will this map, on its release, have custom plugins to add new items and mechanics to the map ? Like for example, in this episode we see 2 things that could have custom items. The wild west village with a weaponry shop, which could bring life to wild west guns like revolvers and repeating rifles. Or the railroad system, which could work with a plugin to make it not just a decoration, but actually a useful mechanic to travel around the map.
You shoul be hired by mojang
Can i join this usw world plsss
Ngl, this is probably my favorite biome you’ve done
Nice builds
Are you gonna do the nether next?
Best Minecraft builder in the world
You should try pvp
i think you should make possible the free download of the map.
Hey, incredible job! I love this map! I love has are you referencing some things. I was wondering if you can reference something of The Witcher :D
I think a good addition would be custom NPCs, such as bandits, miners, custom villagers (for their corresponding biomes), and maybe even some lore based NPCs. Some should even have side quests too.
How do you play the map
This guy is amazing I'm impressed enough to like you got a new sub 😀😄
Are you upgrading the nether? And this was my favourite one so far
Plssss snowy mountains next. I CANT WAIT TO PLAYY 😃❤❤❤
The mesa biome look really like rdr2 and it's beautiful you did a great job
Can u also try to do this to nether and end.  Fan from India🇮🇳.
Can I play this on Minecraft pe
this gonna be free or paid?
This is the most entertaining impressive build I’ve ever seen
He looks so…. British
Bro its just gonna get griefed 💀
What if I were to put the RL craft modpack on this?
Don't talk about what he should build next, lets talk about how amazing and breathtaking this is!!!!! Massiv respect to trixy. You doing great work! <3 <3 <3 <3
please make a server out of this that would be crazy
for the mesa:  YoU tRyNa SaY aRiZoNa LoOkS lIkE tHiS BoY? XD
I love your western town and I would also like to say that it would be cool making a castle in the tiaga biome
Very well done! But tbh I thought there would be a stable for the iconic horses of the west. Either way well built!
Arthur morgan will be there
Can you put this in marketplace for free
i find it retarted to make this availabe to patrions only like bro u spent about a year or more making this shit and only give it to ppl who pay shit to u like damn like i dont mind ppl supporting u with their money just teh fact that u r not giving this to ur whole community
don`t forget every nether biome and the end.
What's the download link without your builds
galion/pirate ship in the bay where the water comes in and there's like a pizza slice taken out of the island. ship would have pillagers and some OP king and queen villagers in the brig/prison under the ship to fight your way to.
Too bad i dont have enough money to get this map, it looks so exciting and amazing:(
When will it be released
This is Actualy INSANE What you build here, Incredible Job! always looking forward to every new video, Keep going mate, it means a lot and give tons of inspiration
This is so good my shitty laptop would probably explode if I tried to select this map in the main menu
nice
bro looks like he hasnt slept in a week
14:30 Why is everything dark? I think you got your HDR wrong, bud!
When will you do the tundra one
are you going to be mad at my if i copy a litle bit of your idea, becouse i'ts so cool and i wanted to try something like this to. sorry for bad english.
Dude you deserve more subs this is absolutely insane
Im pretty sure is not minecraft
Bret work trixyblox! Your buildings are so good you should join hermitcraft. Other viewers comment on this if you agree
This better be put on the marketplace for bedrock
Make a Clock Tower in Savana Biome Village and a huge bunker with a laboratory inside it in Snow Biome
I'm imagining this all with the create mod. Imagine the potential. And even Immersive Railroads for the heck of it.
Immagine if you do a hunger games in this map
How i cant to go this mc world (im bad english)
For the Savannah biome, maybe an elephant deity or lion deity?? Just a thought is still possible.
This is literally Wano from One Piece
I wanted to ask, when this map comes out.. how can I get it? Because I'm so hyped for it man.
My goal in 2022 is to get much better at building I am below average for ability and its not like I don't have imagination it's more like I can't put what I have in my mind in the game and your videos realy give me inspiration because I see you do it and I think well why cant I get there one day so thank you.
Your vids have inspired me to make a dragon about 400 blocks long 😅
what will nether and caves look like on this map?
That was an insane build but am i the only one who wanted to see the big iconic stone from the dirt race track in cars 1?
Hey! @TrixyBlox, you should add oil wells in a biome.
Love it really dude
we are keeping up the hype?? more like: your updates keep us hyped ^^
damnnn this railroad is giving me the vibes also the little vegetation around the city in the mesa biome makes it more immersive
Make a big casta
I wish I could play this in console
I trust you, I hope you will make it to the end
sorry i know lots of people have probably already asked but where will i be able to download this without paying for the membership on patreon
you should add a mod where you could take some guns from the weapons shop
Best MC Utuber😌✨💖
This world is the best world i've ever seen!!
I wish i was this good at building in minecraft 😔
can u download the world??????
Anyone else notice that its literally the Hunger Games: Catching Fire arena but in Minecraft?
crazy kwatog
Please do a Hindu temple in the jungle or mountain biome
if you buy the map how many gigs will it be lol
Woow
Pls include some indian temples as place of worship , their are really beautiful  temples in South India but my preferred one is ram mandir which is work in progress , but search some up , there are a tonnes of them
I hope you do something Viking related for the snow
I like what you have done so far and I had an idea for the snow/ice biome. There should be a massive underground temple in is a giant frozen monster that is lock in chains and the temple is built to hide the monster from the world so no one finds it
I think that he kinda missed a shot. He could have had an incredible scene of the the miners loading ore onto a train as well as some being loaded onto a riverboat at the dock.
I would love to see new wildlife and npcs
Probably no one will see this comment but here‘s an idea: Place just ONE block of Netherrack somewhere random on this 16‘000‘000 block world as an easter egg
Please do the savanna biome next and can you please add a volcano to one of the biomes?
It feels like a actual wild west game with shaders good job
western town with no stable?
How to make your video plan ? (Camera rotate...)
I wanna try and see if I can get this ported to Console.
Hay when we’ll you do the coastal kingdom  Not to rush you but really exsited to see the coastal kingdom  Love ❤️ the underground and underwater kingdoms love your vids  So exited
On the snowy mountains it would be cool if you did like yeti or mammoth fossals
I can't wait for this to release. I'm going to have so much fun playing with friends and exploring the world. It looks great, Keep it up. 👍
Add another Biome in the sky on Clouds
I am extremely excited to see the final product and actually get to play on it. Been following since the start of the project and get excited for every new vid on the USW. I'm looking forward to finding the secrets and discovering the story of the world
add a under water kindom build in the water and it has drowns plus dont forget about the viliges on the beach
the player should have allies in the game. like the wizard could accompany the player during part of it. or the player meets some knights, idk really
Pls give us the Seed so we can build something on the original Island tooo
Trade with an expert else you will lose all your capital and you will drop off the market The importance of professional mentorship of an expert should be the first step of trading.
Hey Trixyblox I have a proposal for you listen for the ice biome you can make a evil king ice fortress and the king is friends with the evil dessert king  and In the same biome you can make a town with like walls around it that would be really cool and make the village like a Viking one
jojo part 7
I love this playlist. Apart from the insane perfect buildings you do, what I love the most is the backstories from each place. It's incredible. Looking forward part 6 :) and congrats for this past 5 parts Edit: you know what? This map would be even more incredible if it had mods. Not random mods but specially designed mods for this map. Wow, just image a MCA with roles for each NPC in every biome, or bosses created HD for every big building.
Amo seus vídeos 💖, seu mapa está ficando incrível !!!
If I’m being honest the island kinda  looks like the new fortnite map
Is on Launcher or Tlauncher ? Pls repond în next video
I need some help! if i buy the gold on the pateron ($5) before a map update i can download the update too withoute buying it agin???
Imagine playing all of this in VR
Ice spike byoem
Hey, man nice work... I would love if you could give the download link on Planet Minecraft as well
This message is from 2025 and half of the population of earth has been killed. If someone is getting this message stop Elon musk
It would be cool if he made a wakanda type city/tribe
It is INDESCRIBEABLE how exited I am to play this map once it is completely finished. I am very exited to see how you finish this and how large it will be
Hey I know you already finished this biome, but you should add a small jail to the town
Would love to see a reference to the ancient Borgund Stave Church in Norway. It's got a very unique aesthetic that might give you an interesting focal point.
After ever video i dont think i can become further speechless until the next video comes out to prove me wrong. You should try and incorporate a Quaker Meeting House into one of the biomes. They are typically very simple so it would be super cool seeing you try to make it a bit more grand!
This honestly gets more and more amazing, phenomenal as time passes. This is an absolute delight of a video, really!
13:21 What is this music???!!!
7:36 bro said steam engine and added a coal cart?
Please do something Buddhist inspired in this map, it would be so cool to see
It looks amazing great job cant wait to play on it
How about lush caves :( ... even if it's not useful in survival world :( ... fans from philippines
A hindu temple for place of worship please, love from India
What is Java doing? They should hire this man!! XD
For the taiga you should do something based on old slavic wooden buildings, called Terems. That or maybe make it based on oriental pagoda-style buildings or perhaps tibetan monasteries
I never get bored of your videos. Why no boulders in the mesa🤔😕😳🥺
Crazy to think that you built all of this in survival mode. Awesome work man
Will his be available on bedrock???
this man is good
Why cant you make it free? im just trying to have a survival world with my brother but 250 minumum for the world why? i dont want to spend that kind of money and i dont really have that much of money at the moment
I would love to see a sikh temple :)
Is there going to be any cool ravines or maybe one big ravine smacked somewhere like the plains biome?
Knowing he wont see this but I want to suggest building a World Tree. Which roots make the the borders of the lands and gives them a simple border which separates them from the rest.
This is a really ambitious proposition, but you should try to find someone who is well versed in making Minecraft RPGs and get them to add proper npc’s and complex enemies to the map. Though that is asking for a lot.
In the taiga biome, you could take inspiration from nordic/vikings architecture, like the temple of uppsala, or any stave church
Dude I’ve seen this map on a server before?? I can’t remember which server tho :(
That moment when you sit down to watch a minecraft building video but actually learn fun facts about the Wild West towns   *\(｡-‿-｡)/*
how about adding some stables to your mesa biome
I would like to see a Hindu temple in Snowy mountains which could be Himalayas.
can the snowy hills have a mines of moria theme?
Bro this is awesome! I can’t wait to play it!
My guy just made Adventure Time—
You’re the best bilder
How would one get this on PS4?
I really think having an East Asian culture (specifically Japanese) in the super snowy biomes would be really cool! the vibrant reds from Shinto shrines and the green of traditional gardens from my home would pop beautifully in the snow, and the outdoor saunas in hot springs would fit perfectly!
Maybe you should put a railroad track in the middle of the train track, because why not!
I think he puts to much effort into the builds. Great work
I feel like the western town needs more like a corral&barn or a farm opposite of the train station side i feel like it would complete it a lot more
Just go play Rust!
u once told the map will be free u lied
PLEASE PLEASE do a horse stable
skyrim in Minecraft but theres also a lot less snow
does anyone know, if you could play this in online server mode with friends? i have my own nitrado server and would like to implement this build via seed id or something like that when it's finished
I'm saddened by there not being a one room school house and a boot hill cemetery. Can't have a wild west town with out a cemetery.
Wait you have to pay to download it or ?
Your all created map is best 💯
Where is the stronghold?
how... just how?
Its really so mesmerising to see someone you have been watching from the first times grow huge Feels so good to call my self an OG viewer 😂
I like the cacti 🙃  Amazing transformation TrixyBlox! I love how the USW is coming together and I'm really excited for the next episode!
What's the seed
its been 2weeks
If only we could ride the train :/
when is this project done?
Yea boy new video
I admire your hard work.
PLS the savana biome use arabic look's
Can I get it on my Xbox
İ think you can add the east culture to the map like japanese buildings and sakura trees alsa the samurais..
Will this be available for bedrock?
and play on this?
Is there someway I’d be able to copy this world for mine?
Maybe you could add atlantis  somthin from journey 2
yo i like the design its perfect western style
Is it just me, or does Trixy look healthier in this vid? I mean, he hasn't looked sickly in the past, but I think he kinda glows in this vid
Wow
farplane2 will be so perfect for this map
I hope once this world is released ill be able to add the create mod to make those trains actually work it would look so good
Que mapa incrível esse map vai ter uma versão pro mcpe ?
You should have one of those minecart systems from movies as fun!
can you give us a list or recommendation for mod packs to use when playing to enhance the experience or bring it to the vision you wanted it to be
You hit the 250,000 like goal and got 300k, for part 6, please upgrade the Savannah biome with custom builds and stuff, also upgrade the Savannah village and add a copper mine, one question, are you putting this map when it's finished on the Minecraft Marketplace? Please do, I want to experience it myself, also make the map free.
Ah yes a minecraft Red dead version
very late comment but you should get  a modder to help you out move the train know that kind of stuff
Dude I really hope the world is dense
You missed a stable for the town
Im thinking about one thing: how big is that map is? I mean, how long time would it take to WALK from one edge to the farest other one?
Bro in the icebiom part you can do the Turkısh mythology i guess it fill fit so well
nether :)
When you transform the snowy mountains, Can you make a village with log cabins?
Wow, this is incredible but I don’t know if you tought about having simple plugins coming with the map… ex: When you break cactus heads around the cactuses it actually gives you a cactus item
i think a shrine would be a welcome place of worship
;) beautyfull
can you like put some more modes like animals, mobs, armor and weapon or like the (create) mod so there will moving things  and when you put it on minecraft bedrock edition can you make the price 310 because I am broke the only i can afford maximum 310
Like your content
In the snowy mountains you should create something in the style of the villages in the Himalayas
if its done can i download it in bedrock
Please add these things: Fallen shattered ice spikes Tiki torches Taiga ruins Mega ice spikes Ice spikes houses Mega snow hills Yeti statue Spiral ice spikes Frozen warriors (villagers in in ice cubes Yeti ruins  Taiga spike boulder  Mega ice spike like very big Giant statue of the ancient warrior and builder Frozen ghast because ghast used to spawn in the winter biome and make it look like they were extinct Ghast ruins which tells how the ghast got extincted and how they got transported to the nether Frozen fountain
Here's some future lore I created: a virus spreader from an unknown creature called the warden that created blue liquid that can infect the victim and turn them into blue shiny moss so they moved to the nether making crimson villages and soul villages, the mobs were too dangerous so they got stronger and found netherite, gold, and quartz and they made armor tools and other stuff. They kill hoglins now because they can't farm and since it's too hot people got dehydrated but they sometimes visited the overworked to get liters of water they built a big barrier because water evaporate too fast so they have to drink in the overworld. The blue liquid couldn't get through because the warped and crimson wood and netherack and etc was too strong to be infected. Ghast now spawn more , and more villagers died and their souls got sucked in by soul sand
Dude if this work on the Android my server is full of a lot chaos 😂
I recomanded a floating island for stronghold
Нотч гордится тобой
In the snowy mountain biome he should make the place of worship a Buddhist temple
This is amazing
My potato android is not going to be happy when I play this map
Is the map free to play
I want you to make a a big dungeon in the in the snowy biome and also make like some statues to go with it
Will there be anything custom below Y-0? Or will it just be left to worldgen to take care of that?
Add a custom sound pack
The tribes could have  connections to the jungle but believe in like Hinduism
The mesa soundtrack sounded like old west version of Dune
could we have like a wikken/pagan alter
try a shinto temple
Honestly I think you should add an Indian camp
I would love to see amethyst golem or statue i some kind of caves.
You are working so hard on this and I would love to see the shattered savannah biome instead of a regular savannah, with floating islands and cascading waterfalls that come out of those islands that start from know where. This is a suggestion, if you don’t do it this world will look amazing with or with out it, keep up the good work
The railway track was just looking the Minecraft rail and looking real
Make a Hindu temple with all the Hindu Gods
not you adding colonizers that is Hilarious
Any Indians?
you are doing so much work but how long does it take you to make the biome's
can we play this map for ourselfs for free?
I want this worlds played on civilization Mc
Can you put this in the bedrock store when it’s done so PlayStation players can play it
is this for free
Will this be available for bedrock players?
I would’ve appreciated a little gold *panning* shack out somewhere near the rivers that would have brought some more ambiance to the gold rush style
I think having a monk monastery in either the taiga or the snowy mountains there would be absolutely cool! Maybe there could be the head monk be exiled from one of the other villages and made a pilgrimage up the mountain! Love the series!
you are one of the best builders in world of minecraft
is this available on bedrock? I would love to play this on ps5.
Please can you make a Treasure Hunt spamming all of the biomes it will be fun
All of these maps would be great with that one parasite mod, and would be quite the challenge, saying as there’s at least 1 village in each biome.
hmmmm reminds me of red dead redemption
Can we utilize a Jewish temple somehwrr
among us shape
You will do the caves?
I wanna see an SMP with this world
Nice video check our channel it’s called otter this world
If you make this a real world there will be so many GRIEFERS
You know, this biome kinda reminds me of the spice mines of kessel, from star wars
Try and incorporate a mosque!
did you create   massive craft?
At the end of building you could make a video in wich you play the world in survival or record other peoples reactions
By far the best Minecraft transformer(building's and biomes in Minecraft)🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't stop crying 😭😭😭😭, it's so perfect
Looks like a croissant
this world you and steph created is just absolutely stunning, well done you two!
good job i want to play this world when its done
Reeeeeally sorry, but I'm probably gonna pirate the map because I'm broke...
Will the Ultimate Survival World be available on bedrock?
Will this be available on xbox ??
This is INSANE great job on the world, its insane! I only wish I could get it on bedrock edition
What website do you use?
wow
Will this be available on bedrock?
Will you release the map?
why do we have to pay
lol chunks are loading while the outro is playing
https://youtu.be/UFTML18J9B4 You did it again!
It would be awesome if this turned into something along the lines of ”the forest”, but with npcs and stuff like that
you could add an amerindian village to give the mesa that true far-west vibe
Imagine TrixyBlox And Jeracraft Building Together
a LiTtLe BiT mOrE oF tErRa FoRmInG *proceeds to change the entire biome*
Easily going down as the greatest minecraft build ever
Dude I literally had a dream of being in ur mesa Biome and saw the train actually move on the railroads. Kinda cool
In the Snow moutains please make viking villages where the place of worship is a building for oden, thor, freja etc.
Imagine accidentally deleting the world....
Plese make indian temple
This IS SO GOOD you did so well
You should add a volcano into your maesa biome bc I think it would really add to it idk why Love ur vids!
What if u made a custom end and nether for the world. Just an idea.
Is this available for just the ps4 minecraft?
This is the non toxic part of minecraft
Pls Transform PewDiePie's Minecraft Hardcore base!!
if you made an abandend nether portal people will probably go to the nether so you'll probably want to upgrade the nether to.
I’m loving it so far, but I do have one, major concern for this world. Material respawning. If we cut down a tree, wouldn’t it just come back as a default tree, if it even respawns at all? I know it’s a knitpick, but I do feel like it’s a major one. Especially in biomes such as the plains, where there are so few materials for crafting. But everything else I’m loving, keep up the great work old boy!
10 sec skip means 10 days skip 🥰🥰🤩🤩😍😬
I just want to know if it’s playable on Java and bedrock
You should build some Lord of the Rings builds like the dwarves' mines or the  valley fortress. That should be amazeing!
是不是真的啊哈哈吧唧吧唧我是不是你好像啊额额嗯啊阿吖啊阿阿啊哈喽你好久你7​if付出啊哈喽你的名字你的意
Salam is ti fa də bu cür tədbirlərin həyata keçirilməsi ilə əlaqədar Azərbaycan Respublikası Konstitusiyasının mətnində ki qaldı ki bu mi nin məlumatına əsasən yağmursuz keçəcək ki bu gün Azərbaycan xalqı öz üzərinə götürüb bir ekf r u can fodn37fheiyb
U never seem to fail to amaze me, keep up the good work
@Trixy block can I get the map for free somehow?
You might also be able to add a stable because thinking of the old west all I can think about is horses and they need a place to stay
Actually changed my mind on the piston door idea PLEASE add a Gale Sanctum-like structure when you tackle the mountains pls
How can I play this?
Love it as always! Still holding out hope for some classical Roman/greek architecture 🤞
In the snowy mountain s you should make a yeti cave.
how do i play this? online
Is this gonna be available to play single player?
For the next biome village for the place of workship, please make it a gurdwara. The workship place of Sikhism. Hopefully you read this!  - Thank you!
look like wano kuni
A Hindu/Buddhist temple would be cool to include. I dunno if you included anything from Islam yet though so maybe that, and if you don't feel like it's too controversial you can look into satanism too.
I have 1 question. Does this world have all natural resources in a normal world like naturally generated diamonds coal or gold. And does it have gold as a common resource in mesa biome?
Thanks for devoting all of this time for our entertainment. You're amazing.
I'd name this project The Ultimate Survival
You should put an A.I person on your world that will be great
Is this map is going to be free
its been 10 days
Can u made it in bedrock edition
can’t believe you can come up with such crazy good designs i fucking suck at building lmao
If notch sees this the map slod over millonS
Are you going to remake caves, nether and end?
When you explained the upgrades and what you did I got massive ark vibes
whats that golden glowing ore in the mines? was there a new snapshot?
PLEASEEEE I BEGG YOU MAKE IT AVAILABLE ON BEDROCKKKK
You out here making red dead 2 in minecraft.
how do you generate custom worlds? do you need minecraft membership or something? (for generating biomes of choise?
would love to see a asian style mountain village in the snow biom with a budism temple
Mary steph
that mineing town looks amazing btw but also looks like something straight out of borderlands 1
It would be cool if you changed the sea too. Mayebe put some history that connected with the pirate history
well, one thing I’d like to see is the end and/or a bit of the nether hub.most likely the end, butttttt . . I’d like a reference to the dragon, like a shrine maybe?hidden somewhere like, somewhere?i dunno’s, but yeah!
You need to add the horse stables western town
Happy new year
I really like that. I am wondering about how somebody can have the motivation for that😀😌😅
will you make nether to
its been 9 days
2:18
for the snow biome, do a great hall like you see in how to train your dragon!!! it would be cool, and still give a warm inside for a cold environment!! keep up the amazing builds!
I would love to see some type of secret hollow earth type city in the map
If this is don you have to sell this in bedrock market for the konsol players if you dont then i dont know what to say cause this map is great so far
What will it be ?
2022: Project making the whole earth by myself
I’d love to see a town like maybe the snowy mountains worshipping a style of Norse mythology. Sort of like god of war
MORE DIMONSIONS?!??!?!??!?!??!?!???!??!?!?!? !
How to get the map
How have I not seen you before?
Mcpe?
Awesome work but I've been meening to say is this world going to be able to be on xbox or mcpe
The end / nether  Deep dark cities caverns etc...
pls add a hot spring in mountain
I love your builds🤍 Could u include in one of your future biome revamping a temple to worship hinduism?
Really cool but do  it in survival.
Will this be available for bedrock?
I want more than just a pirate ship. I want a pirate paradise or a pirate cove.
i am going to go insane if the snowy mountains aren't inhabited by satanic cultists
Can you realise your world on bedrock edition
Looks like the bionicle map
In my opinion you should add red school, beacuse it perfectly match with wild west. But even without this school that what you do is amazing (sry for my english im from Poland)
Man, I’m so sad this isn’t free download… but hey, you deserve all the money others give you for it. You are such an incredible builder and awesome person! Nice job with the map and story! I will be sure to watch when/if someone does a let’s play, since I can’t buy it myself xD I’m sure the story will be legendary, just like the map ;)
Imagine if Mojang updated the Badlands like this.
I would love to see a Himalayan themed architecture for the mountain biome
You should have added a train falling over a bridge that the Outlaws blew up to  steal anything it ways transporting that would have been cool
This honestly inspires me to make my own little adventure map for my friends to play on console.
Can you do a dragon squeleton pls
Dude pleeease build pride rock in the savanna. That would be SOOO COOL
Great job, i look forward to the next episode and I suggest an orthodox church, once again AWESOME WORK, happy new year and christmass c ya soon.
im glad to see this project once again. and i still am excited to play it when it comes out.
I was wondering if you could do something for Wiccans or possibly Buddhists
I thought it was gonna be for everyone to download
This is really cool and all but if the map is 16,000,000 blocks how are we supposed to travel across this world without it taking a month
I don't know if you have ever seen the movie "The Hobbit" but if you have, you should make the huge dwarven mountain castle in the snowy area. Have a dwarven area would be huge!
now we have already been to 2 warm places.  I would suggest that something cold be added now.  for example the snowy mountains ..
bro this is so cool i can't wait to get the map!
Imagine playing on this world with the MineColonies mod
cliffs biome
U deserve a sub for this MATE
It needs a stable though
A suggestion for USW is to change the ropes between the masts on the shipwrecks. Now the ropes are made from fences that don’t link up with each other and they all look like they are floating separately (seen in https://youtu.be/4TnQ6uMEqgs at 14:38). I honestly don’t know what material could make it look like it is one connected rope, but I noticed it and wanted to adres it.
I like to see Savanah animals be in USW Savannah
Dude, you're insane... O.O
How to get ultimate survival map
Watching these is just so satisfying. When I was younger I use to make these big projects alone manually taking hours a day until my ipad broke n I lost everything. Love the railway bridge tho, really bring more aesthetic to it. The summary just make it seem so easy to make this world but i can imagine the amount of time needed to make n brainstorm all these. Amazing work buddy.
it looks amazing
It would be more awesome if put a volcano it's freaking ridiculous
you could have the mine that links up to all the other biomes also lead to the stronghold/end portal somewhere in the center of it all. make it another maze-like structure too
I was gonna have this on in the background while playing minecraft, but I just kept coming back to see what was happening because it's all just so impressive, detailed, and in a way, grand and cinematic!
Glaciers off the north shore, n 3 costom dungeons. Skeleton. Zombie. Spider. ??? Also stronghold??
Stumbled upon your channel now and thought it was pretty awesome, until I realized you hold future videos ransom for the number of likes - not to mention the incessant begging for subscribers. Like seriously, your content should live or die on its own merits, the begging is just utterly pathetic.
You could try a Hindu temple in the Savanah.  Maybe :)
Man’s made a fortnite Battle Royale map
The hotel looks a bit to modern. Maby make it a bit smaller and use more wood. Great video!
Do the Taiga & snowy mountains next! Save the best for last.
Bro i need you to make a bedrock version of this pleaseee
i literally idolise this work.
Different types of players waiting for this to come out: Explorers: OMG YESSSS FINALLY!!!!!! I CANT WAIT!!!! Builders: WOAH! So much inspiration! This will truly be awesome! Miners: I’ll never have to see the light of day again!!! Farmers: g-guys… where are you going? W-wait I just- but it’s- all I need is-… -incoherent blubbering-
i really wanna see a monastery in the snowy mountain biome, similar to those seen in himilayan and asian culture
Hi just found you are you adding non vinila elements
this is simply incredible, idk how u can do all pf this, its crazy
Weather: it's freezing outside, maybe go get a jacket TrixyBlox: *OY MATE, WE'RE GONNA BE BUILDIN' A VERY HOT WESTERN TOWN 🤠*      jk I love ur vids even though I'm a new fan <3
Maybe add a horse stable to the mesa and a general store, perhaps even a barn
Immagine playing on this world then u go to the nether and see that it’s completely normal
what if there's a fallen train under the rail road? maybe the player could hear about this vanished train and go down to the bottom of the canyon to investivate? i feel like that would be an incentive for the player to appreciate the whole of the mesa biome, not just the village
Am I the only one who gets Rhodes vibes when seeing that town?
if you can hire a modder please do bc if you added custom bosses it would make this world 10x cooler!
I love these videos!
Can you put the map on bedrock cause I play on it pls
I am obsessed with Nordic culture so I would love a Viking reference in the taiga forest
🍃
Can you do the snow biom next? Please, i have been waiting for that one seans the beginning. Please I love your videos
with the north snowy/mountain booms can you make a viking village where they usually lived on the coast and prayed to the nordic gods
Mans built a map with the help of world edit and has gotten half of it done in half a year. Damn, school must be kicking your ass, huh?
Does it work for bedrock edition
Might I recommend maybe making like a viking village for the taiga biome?
What is the seed so we can play tricky btw love what your doing
I feel like the mesa is missing a few homes scattered around, not too far but not too close to the town. Maybe a farm
Am I the only one who would love playing an only builders project? like everyone is good at building and no ones griefing? I think  it would be awesome to have a server only for builders. I hope my comment does not get deleted any time soon.
Hey, can you put this on the Bedrock Marketplace? I think you’ll get even more attention if you do.
Hmm yes LORE
So  Plains and Mesa=church Desert=mosque Dark oak wood=Synagogue Jungle=Aztec/mecca temple Snowy mointains=Greek temple? Taiga=Buddhist temple? Savana=Hindu temple?
The one big question I have. Underneath the ground, will it only be stone or will there be ores aswell? What about deepslate? Is it like a normal world with caves or just a big block of stone?
awesome work
How much will it cost to download?
Do you have a bedrock version of this ? Java is so laggy, my potato pc can't handle it
i think you shoud make water and in wormer bimons to need more water and you can die if you are in the wormer biomoms with out getting close to ice or ´cold blocks
a mandir (hindu temple)
How the fuck do you make transparent letters in vanilla?
i love this
Cant wait aaaah
You should make an ocean civilization too from the ocean monument
Chinese style buildings very epic
Is this compatible with Bedrock? I wanna play this with RTX. I preffer Java, but this deserves RTX.
Man this world will be so realistic after wild update and othe update 😃😃😃
This would be amazing with questing and custom NPCs by using a mod like custom NPCs or collaborating with a modder to create a custom mod/modpack. This would be insane and I would definitely pay for it!!!
Just saw your video on my feed and instantly subscribed and hit the notification bell. Love all your videos and builds without even viewing them yet! Would love to see you recreate a Lego Ninjago build for it is one of my favorite shows even as a teenager now. Binge watching all your videos tmrw!
This would be insane with a mod or mod pack that has the player meet the characters and do quests that show off the deep lore of this world. New characters, mobs, NPCs and questing would be perfect for this world! Please make it, I and many others would pay for it!

Make an arabia based biome too. BTW keep up the good work😊. I suggest to make a viking based biome too in snow biome.
Also could you make an orthodox church sometime? It would be my Xmas gift
Your such a good builder, honestly
Best one yet!
I would love to play in this world but i dont have a pc
It would be cool with mods
I hoped for some barn for horses in town. A little farm or a ranch alone in somewhere would be also good. Although, you have made a loads of gorgeous work on this projekt. You have my thump up and respect. Keep it going.
anyone know what the seed is bc i am on ps4
i wanna watch ppl playing this map
this is so impressive
Did he just say ''Movie Series''!
just like rlcraft, this map is going to be trendy when its finished
the nether and end plz
Do you need to pay to have the final map?
You should make the legend of zelda breath of the wild in minecraft that would be amazing
Tell me how to make the s
This is amazing Trixy. Would've loved to see you change the trainstations so they fit their task better
You are the reason why I love making things in Minecraft
I just lost all of my progress on Minecraft. But still I'm gonna make a mega build! I got some designs off of you! You are the best Minecraft builder I know! Just wanted to say
Wynncraft be like
Super cool would have wished to see a stable/ horse vendor building since it fits well with the wild west location.
For other places of worship I think it would be cool to see something more mythology based like a Greek building of worship
Will I be able to get this on PlayStation?
It gave me an red dead redemption 2 feeling
Maybe for the Snowy Mountains, you could do a Tibetan monastery/Shinto shrines for the place of worship?
Make it available for p.e
I know it would have been really hard but you should have had the train going to other areas of the world
I love this survival world it's soooooo cool💙
Do the mountains please
I would love to download this world but I’m on console and I don’t think it works on console
Will this be available in the store for bedrock edition? That would be amazing.
Can Savana be next?
Are the caves on the level of 1.18 or are they even crazier
Can't believe my eyes
Love it so much
Wow lol so cool this
I don’t even play this game, but I can tell this took a while and I can respect that.
Finally Minecraft has found a way to be a realistic game
love this, it doesn't even look like minecraft anymore
This is lit
Can you upgrade nether fortresses and bastions please it would be really cool if you did
You should make this a mod pack
How can i visit this world?
Please build a Buddhist temple for the savanna
I’m not sure if you’ve said it, but are you planning on transforming the end and the nether? If not, you absolutely should, it would really make the world stand out even more
This was amazing good job I think that if you do snowy mountain next you should do Rule old Japan religion and mythology in the mix and have a story about the people along side of it maybe they would be secluded like real Japan
it is beautiful but the chests on the map will be full or empty?
I hope you use the create mod to make the trains life like and not just.blocks just standing there
Amazing content. 👏
Is there going to be ore and cave generation as normal underground, or will we have to go to the settlements to gather iron, diamonds, etc.?
When is the other episode coming?
I'm so sad I cannot play Minecraft T^T
What tools do you guys use including software I'm creating a voxel game with rpg elements with a focus on building and I was curious about tools I could add as default
Do Vikings in the snowy mountains
Bro this map is the map in Lego bionicle no
I thought it would’ve been a good idea to do the snowy since it’s Christmas time
When its released do i have to be a patreon to get it? Im too poor :(
I can already see the Mr.Beast making an event from this
I love it
i would love to see you on a server like legacy or hermit craft !!!
On the next Church make them worship jeb
Add RTX with DLSS to this and it’s gonna be smoooooooooth.
Amazing good work

Merry Christmas and happy new years trixy and Steph, and thank you so much for this journey, I really appreciate the hard work you're put in for us just so we could can have fun 😊
How to play this?
For the snowy mountains or the taiga, you can make a Hindu temple or ashram of some kind as it suitable for the nomad sage life or some kind. Hope it comes in the USW. Btw Your builds are INCREDIBLE!!!!!
the western village look like the one from the animated movie “Rando” to me
Will this be able to play on bedrock/Pocket edition??????
You build better than grian
Best minecraft series
Amazing
Red dead vibes
hey, so i have this crazy idea that you should add a ancient religion called paganism. its just an ancient lithuanian religion that you can add in maybye spruce forest? i don't know, but yeah it's a sugestion
You could have made a building for undertakers and one for stonemason attached to it!

I want to see dream do a manhunt in this
I am so excited for when this comes out!  also, in just 6 days, that goal was absolutely SMASHED! 282k likes!  Have fun, Trixy!
i can imagine someone tryna speedrun this world
I hope the snowy mountains area has a warm and cozy little village tucked inside. Even if not, keep up the good work!
You should do a Samurai village with villagers in the main house because the Samurai couldn't keep to there honor with another region locking there villagers in there basement behind there job sites and the Samurai lost there way by disappearing and never being seen again
Actually thinking of a Fallout New Vegas from the look of this Mesa
Mf is making Mata Nui in Minecraft, respect
Can't we get your hard work on mcpe ?? Anyways love ur work.
Will this be an smp or a downloadable world
I'm in complete awe with this world. Also, I don't know how you and Steph are able to do such builds like this and to this scale at that. Never in my life would I even come close to making something as beautiful and large-scale like you did here. Major props to you, my friend. I'm hooked already!
Yeah
Bro you should make a movie all about this 💅
I wanna see a grand civilization hidden deep under the winter section. They could tie into the magic the witches have and could serve as helpful characters or as main antagonists.
Can't wait the YouTubers play your really good creations
Can't wait to try this ultimate survival world!
put in some 1.18 biomes and blocks
U want our money
OMG this looks amazing, u should add a crop farm and cattle farm
https://youtu.be/LLodFsx8p8Y
If these guys made like a small city and chuck in a Spider-Man mod. I’d be super hyped
your dragging this on too long, its repetitive and taking too long
Wow my day was going good but when I saw this to post I just made it 10 times better and I’m not just saying that to make him feel better I just really enjoy his videos and how he does it and I can’t wait for this to come out
When this comes out can I get it on bedrock
Hey trixy, idea for the next place of worship, u can build a Hindu temple
I have insane amounts of respect for you.
imagine oregon trail in minecraft... oh wait.....
He built wano kuni 🤔
I have watched all the progress Trixy, this is gonna be the best map to play in the history of Minecraft, and I can wait to see the movie by Steph too!
You should do the snow biome and make it a Viking themed
For the snowy biome you should do an Alaskan build and a ice age to
This seems like a good map to hold a hunger games event with my friends but I have no money
Will the map be available on console?
You are absolutely brilliant!!!! I watched the whole video with my jaw open the entire time.
You should used the gears mod for this
This is amazing keep working hard this Survival word has lots of potential
Just a request, please make the taiga a russian themed with trenches fox holes destroyed canons and dead bodies and a ruined city! Thanks
Talk about wasting your life
show norse paganism/ vikings in one of them
THIS IS A LORE BUILD THAT CONNECTS THE END TO THE OVERWORLD! IN EACH BIOME, THERE ARE SECRET CAVES BENEATH THE GROUND THAT HAVE THE END PILLARS THAT HAVE BEEN SEALED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. IN THE DISTANT FUTURE, THEY WILL RISE FROM THE GROUND AND CREATE AN END PORTAL IN THE CENTER OF THE ISLAND.  THE PILLARS HAVE MOLD, DUST, VINES OR DEBRIS - DEPENDING ON WHAT BIOME IT'S IN..
use tektopia mod i think it's will be so cool
I Want Mojang Make Some Car Or Something Modern Cause Sometimes Player Want Some Modern Stuffs But Some Players Is Idiot Cause Other Player Dont Know The Addons/Mods Where Player Can Choose Car Army City Guns And Other Some ModernStuff
För the mountains do something with AXOLOTLS
Maybe the snowy mountains can have a Nordic viking village. Where they arrived from far away lands to conquer the island only to become stranded. They would have Norse mythology type religion and worship gods like Thor and Odin.   A cool idea for the mountains would be to build a massive "Thor's hammer" which had collided with the mountain creating a massive canyon where the village would be built around with the immovable hammer as a support and religious icon.
I can just imagine the rp servers that could be made with this world
This village looks like Vallentine (red death repemption 2)
wow
Love your work. you are awsome. If i would change anything it would probly be by adding some dead bushes around with the cacti.
smh its not even an infinite world
This map looks amazing
Would this large world be available for ps4 players?
Make gold ore under the water
You should make a Viking/Norse themed pillager outpost for the tundra!
Translate my message because is very important  Pour le biome montagne tu pourrais faire une sorte de château d’un méchant ou dans se style la  Puis tu pourrais pour n’importe quelle biome crée une ville du futur
Do something to do with paganism
Ima hold that bank up reaaaaal goooooood
Are u gonna do abandon mineshafts
The Sheriffs Office.  You Forgot About The Sheriffs Office.
Will this map be playable for betrock as well? Asking for a friend
Game Name: Minecraft: The Age Of Adventures
whoa. simply whoa.  I'm not a minecraft player at all, I launch it 2-3 times in a year just to spend a couple of evenings in survival mode, checking what updates had brought in just to uninstall it later — not my kind of game really. But I recall watching some of your older videos a year or two ago because they were so satisfying to watch. And, yeah, sometimes I've used them as something to fall asleep at.  Seems that the ALLMIGHTY ALGORITHM remembered that and showed me.... this. And this iz amazing. All this attention to details, creativity, hard work — simply breathtaking. You definitely deserve a subscription to both this channel and your patreon. After this video I had to watch all previous parts of this series and it's really astonishing. Thanks for the great content man. I'll definitely have to play it once it's done.   I wonder if you're gonna add some Scandinavian or Russian vibe to the snow biome. An Orthodox church would be amazing as well as a nice sauna :) As well as a giant ice sculpture, like the "froat museum" in Yakutia.  Thanks again for the content dude. You're awesome
I can't wait till it's all finished
You're an incredible builder and YouTuber!!! Your builds are super impressive and I love your voice and content! However I noticed a little something and I thought I'd just give a little constructive critizism if that's okay... whenever there are webcam segments, the footage looks like it is really great quality, but desaturated and really grey for some reason, and if you edit in Premiere Pro there are really easy way to do some colour grading on specific video files and great tutorials how to do so :) But it's not going to change the quality of the content a whole bunch, it's just visual, so feel free to ignore this comment, if you don't feel like looking into it, hope you have a great day! :D
That's amazing! It's breathtaking all the work you have done on this biome ! Too hype for the final product!
Will u do custo. Stronghold
How about make a horror atraction
is this Java or Bedrock? and is it going to be a free download?
I think you can add somewhere a lumberjack camp in different biome for that ALL THE WOOD which makes a rail bridges (Sorry for english, feel free to correct me)
Might be hard to fit it in but I think as place of worship you can make temples like the ones seen in Japan.
you forgot the gallows for when people get the death pinalite
Honestly man, you should try looking into doing 3D modeling and creating game environments. You’ve a great eye for design and environmental storytelling that I think could expand beyond just Minecraft
Will this be on marketplace and/or bedrock??
How about a Yeti's cave for the mountans
but this is a world playable by anyone with code?
Hey I would love to see you build Minas tirith from lord of the rings I really love your videos and you have such an amazing way of seeing things and making them bigger and more exciting you really think outside the box!!❤
Make a Norse worship building in the Tundra, and take inspiration from the Norse culture.  Extra: The pillagers should be Vikings.
The music sounds like a mix between Rimworld and Starbound.
Ngl this kinda looks like a fortnite map
i love it!
Mans said "250k likes" bro this deserved at least a mil 😭
tbh this seris is amazing and i can never understand how bilders like you get so good at well bilding i sadly cant play the map but i would if i could this looks amazing and i wish i could see this and i binge your videos at times continu the good work!
Absolutely love it so far!! Should incorporate like a Norse Viking or pagan place of worship! Maybe in the snowy or colder biomes
Please build a Hindu Temple. It'll add a lot of vibrant colour and can add some interesting lore to the story...hope you see this Trixy...
Seeing the train tracks here, it does make me wish that Minecraft had a better way of doing transportation.  I've often wondered what Minecraft would be like with bigger boats, actual trains, etc. for moving large amounts of stuff.  The use of shulker boxes has made it all superfluous since Steve can basically carry infinite items, but still.
Update caves
Just a comment: while the bridges look incredible....the sheer number of rail bridges is....unrealistic to say the least. Bridges are expensive. They were only built where necessary, and you have bridges crossing spans that realistically just a little more track would be able to access on land. Not that there should be no bridges--just there are SO many bridges...and most are very unnecessary.
would be awesome if you used create mod for example to make the trains, cranes ,etc move
pls make a hindu temple 😅
Man!!! Maybe you should try and make Gotham City or Arkham asylum man that would blow not just my brain all over your channel!!! Please lol
can u make it for badrock pls
Its not survival you are liyng
Missed potential story chance by adding a small narrative lore about natives that could be living in the masa biome as refugee outcast of the jungle or planes biome years ago and you have the ability to connect them back to a world or hidden treasure taken from them.
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HEROES DO!
man this is amazing 🤩
I wish I had this much patience, creativity, and/or talent.
Would I be able to download this map on console? Or is that only a PC thing? I love all the work your putting into this!
No way
Op video for making your own world ,best of luck and wish it will complete soon bro
It is available in pocket edition please give in MCPE please🥺
Will this be possible to play on Xbox
TrixyBlox: when you play the map yourself Me with no money: ;-;
Imagine if he had done this AFTER the 1.18 update with the lush and drip stone caves 😭
tbh i dont watch these because i dont wanna spoil myself, id rather just wait for the map release and play it blind.
you are INCREDIBLE! I want the map!
Yes yes yes yes yes
you should add a hindu temple for diversity😀
Hey can i say something about the train    The train build is my fav i was trying to build my train but I realized yours is better i rate it out of a 10000/10000 thanks
I'll hope this map is free 😩
for the mountain biome, mountains in real life have melting ice and snow the turn to a river irl, why not put that in Minecraft, you could make a trench or two in a mountain fill it with snow from the top to y=250 paced ice from there to y=200, ice from thereto y=150 and water from there to the ocean. also in-between three or four mountains add a glacier slowly carving owt a lake filled with water. (WANING TRAVERCE CAREFULLY) why not add little ravines that make it look like the ice is cracking breaking chucks are falling off.   all cause of a rl situation, of GLOBAL WARMING
Idea for snowy mountains: in the snowy mountains is a tribe who worship the Wolfs
You are the best!!!❤
Damn
all that work man you are a legend my guy (:
I have a plan Arthur I just need 2 trillion in taxpayer dollars
This project is really awesome. You put really much effort into this, but why is the beginning of this video 2minutes of Marketing yourself😭
Nossa como eu tava esperando esse vídeo esse mundo está ficando incrível e cada construção detalhe referências bom está maravilhoso c foda cara
will there be the world download?  if so, will it be possible for all or only subscribers to download it?
When this is done MrBeast has to record some videos on this!
The name Club Penguin hit me with a bunch of Nostalgia, the good old days with Club Penguin, perhaps you could add in a Club Penguin easter egg or building.
Can I just say this but YEE HAW! Sorry it’s just it looks like the Wild West mate
You need to be awarded by notch
Omg!!!This is sooooo cooll!!
Idea: make a secret futuristic base under the map. this is going to be the reason everything is happening. They are the reason that theres so much lore, adventuring and uncovering. They are the creators that built the secret foundation under the map. They control everything
How much will this map be???  And also what consoles??
TB can you pls do a Indian temple ruin in one of the biomes? or not even a ruin, a temple I guess. This can be your backstory, An Indian merchant sailed his boat to the island to explore it. Then he was fascinated seeing all the anicent temples that was built on the island. So he got inspired and built an Indian temple which he stored goods and currency where the main GOD statue was. (That can be a looting spot) but the merchants that were living in the mansion envied the Indian merchants goods and currency and his amazing temple so they planned out a heist to steal all his valuables from the temple but they didn't return to the mansion till now...
I dunno if this is planned, but if it isn’t, it would really help this survival world if a data pack or mod was made specifically for this map that helped tweak mob spawns to the specific buildings, and maybe even creating custom NPCs for the wizard and custom villager professions. I think this mod would get quite complicated by the time this entire map is finished, but it would really help with making the map more immersive.
It would be cool to see a roman basilica as a place of worship!
I dont know why but why doesnt he have atleast 30 mil subs
this has got to be one of the craziest vanilla survival world
5:33 Missing the General store
Just like always it looks sick! good job :)
Holy, the train tracks/bridges look awesome
imagine world edit not being a thing 0_0
Could be better if paired with mods like villagers becoming mods and rlcraft mod and others that can upgrade even better
I want this world so bad!
I can't wait to. Play this map!
You’re building abilities are honestly just amazing 🤩
Would be cool for any of the snow biomes to be Viking when you make them
This ultimate survival world idea is PHENOMENAL. I cant believe youve gone this far already too. Its so much work!
I love how awesome this whole world is turning out 🤩
Can’t wait to explore everything
Imagine a hermitcraft season on this world. Would be a little bit small for them since the map is 4000 by 4000 and they tend to spread out pretty far but it probably would be fun
wow this is the most incredible biome so far for sure. easily my favorite out of what you've done so far.
I expected an abandoned us airbase but this quite good. Love the builds!
I know it would be a lot more work and not planned at all but, if you did a sahel village that would be cool. Like a village where the grass land and desert would meet. I know it's already past that part of the video but for future videos it might look cool? I love it all tho and how it's coming out, it looks so cool
when will this be downloadable?
Nhìn đẹp thật đấy :)))
How do I play this??????
Umm bro what is the server ip adress
Bro u legend
Hey I had a idea for the icy mountains for the village you should do like a Inuit tribe
4:40 I was about to go your house with a shotgun if you didn’t put in the saloon you saved yourself.
spill the seed if u had
A mosque
11:18 the blocks do be jiggling
Add somthing like interactive villiger mod and texturepack to this?
should've spent thousands
You know as much as i love the map i wouldnt buy it because ill ide use it for is for tge designs and to see how u make all tye building detail that and im a bedrock player either way so it would never happen
You should make  a yeti cave in the snowy mountains
Greets from Tempe, Arizona! Well done Trix and Steph!!
We need the tutorial: “How I didn’t give up spending 2021 upgrading everything in Minecraft
Nice vid, great entertainment
Do the China Great Wall for the snow area or the North Pole  PLEASE
I suddenly had the huge urge to build a western city but I build like crap
Don't even think, just imagine dedication and imagination...
Synagogue please for the next place of worship! Love your vids!
Achievement unlocked: serious dedication
The effort you put into your videos are incredible! Just a tip, for the larger chains I recommend using grindstones as they will look much stronger than the tiny chains.
Mcpe 😰😰😰😰
Mojang needs to see this
woooo cangrats you got your teeth fixed
This guys gonna make the whole gta 5 map
Need stuff for the horses
In the snow biome you should add Santas workshop
Free download link?
Bro, i’ve never been too much into minecraft. My son plays it here ans there. But if minecraft would be like you make it, i’d most likely get into it. This is awsome, you guys are going all out. I might just have to buy this map when it comes out. Keep it up!
i wish i can play 😭
pretty awsome build, im pretty blown away
This episode just made me really want to play rdr2
I want to downloadddd
You should make a smp? with this map that would be so sick
i cant wait for this to be complete i want to play through this in vr
Imagine doing all of this in SURVIVAL
Can you make that area of water have an underwater town. It would I add mystery to what happened to it. You could make it ruins almost like Atlantis. It can even connect to the tunnels you made in the mesa and jungle underground tunnels. It would leave more room for interpretation as to what happened to the town and the people who lived there
This map could be the Fortnite New map... Also Keep up with the good work.
Imagine playing this world in VR
I really hope that Xbox can play I’ll pay 20 cues I’m poor
maybe in the next area, there can be a church/place of warship based off the Alamo?
dont forget the ocean man
How do you build so realistically
DO A MOVIE
this is absolutely insane, every video you manage to one up yourself, great job. i think this is the coolest build i’ve ever seen honestly.
Do u use world edit
Hey I won’t be able to play usw Minecraft so when you get done with the entire map can you do a like a 100 days survival in Minecraft usw or somthing like that
bro... im only 44 seconds in and this is insane.. wtf.. id love for minecraft to look like this normally
As for the next episode please can you make the next place of worship a mosque just cause like yeah church is cool but I mean...theres a mosque in my town made of gold and it looks so legit
When will I be able to play the map? Is it on Minecraft Bedrock or Minecraft Pocket Edition, and will it be in the market place for minecoins, or for free?
the people in the snowy biome could maybe worship the old Norse gods
Now that is a Mesa biome that feels alive.  Choo choo!
Every time I watch your vids my brain just breaks
could you build or transfer the survival map on to bedrock edition
christ almighty this map would be absolutely amazing if there were mods installed
Maybe you could add a masjid next time
It would be sick if you put a massive shipwreck wedged into an iceberg in the icey biome
Can we install the map?
Add an Asian inspired town
Damn, trixy! This is just... wow
This is so fucking cool holy shittt
So I have an Idea for the mountains or the taiga, a small barbarian village with a wall sarounding it. There can also be a church with a huge skull of a giant on it and there's a lookout inside of the skull where you can look out of the eyes.
This guy put a year and a half of work into a compilation of videos that last an hour and a half like how
poggers
Well done on this map, keep up the excellent work, gutted i wont be able to play this as I currently only play on bedrock and im guessing this is pc only but maybe one when i get myself a decent pc ill be able to play on this map. Again loving the work, im looking forward to seeing the next episode
Im unsure if muslims have a place of worship but if they do, i'd like to see one.
You should add a farm somewhere a good ways away from the town. A wild west themed anything is never complete without the isolated family of farmers that have to travel hours or even days to reach the town and thus are pretty much entirely self-sufficient and only go into town to sell stuff and have a bunch of horses.
Any chance you put this on bedrock?
I thought the thumbnail was some version of the fortnite island for a second
I think an lds temple would be a perfect place of worship for a snowy biome!
Not gonna lie this might be the actual coolest Minecraft world I have ever seen… like wow
When you do the snowy mountains can you make icicle ravine villages with a ice castle?
Amaziiiiiiiiing
Game theory just might be making a vid on this
Could you please make this a map that’s downloadable without patreon
MAKE THIS A MAPPPP
Would love to see churches in the snow biome that look like the Stave churches in Norway, and some dwarf-style cities built high into the mountains for protection from the elements, with little fishing/trapping villages below. And please figure out how to make a viking long house!!
Will this be on  console?
Why is it that Everytime I see a thumbnail of this that think it's a Minecraft replica of the Fortnite island
Making Bosses for each biome would be awesome
In the savanna add an statue of a king
On the tallest mountain add a statue of a king , also big fan of this series
Bro this man is one of the few Minecraft creators I still genuinely enjoy
U should write all the stories in books all around the map so it gives the map history and it would make the map make sense
Do monastery bro
Imagine train moving with "create" mod🥶🥶🥶
I thought that was fortnite-
Microsoft needs to hire him
This guy is the BEST at building, like you can’t get that wrong!
you should add another, smaller town, at the train station
I'm hoping that I don't have to either go to the Mesa or jungle mines for resources and ores cause I'm tryna grind myself out in the plains before heading out and exploring other lands, I'm also worried about how this map will be affected with 1.18 but whatever, this map is making me  so excited can't wait, keep up the good work king and queen 🙏
Sooo what's the seed number
you are the best builder in Minecraft i really want to play on your map
i will comment this (credit to Mister Irrelavant) until it gets noticed  I You should completely lock the end until the player has collected certain artifacts from each biome. This will force us to play the entire map without an elytra and see this world the way it was meant to be seen. It will also make the End feel much more rewarding to explore
2:19 actual video finally starts
I don't have any words to this. Buut.. I have one: WOW!
Love how every time you post one of these you hit the goal in a few days 🤣🤣 you guys deserve it!
stop torturing yourself bro !!! plzz
its the fortnite map
Make a destroyed  flying machine harbor on a small futuristic portal
Collab👏with👏Jera👏Craft👏
This Map with mods omg
Onde faço o download do mapa?
What's the dimensions of this world ?
Choo choo train
I hope there is going to be a Billy the Kid reference here
Good idea to add native culture to the mix
An idea for the snow mountain biome. Perhaps have some sort of wizard tower/ observatory on the highest peak?  I’ll leave the backstory to you
Imagine he making The Stronghold too
Mojang, please hire this man😔
Man has it really been 2 months since the last update? Oh man. It looks so amazing!!
Yo, that outro song was perfect. The beat literally sounded like a steam train, and the tune sounded like that typical Wild West hymn. Nice touch👍🏼
SUS ISLAND
Hey, will this be available for xbox?
It would be awesome if you could fit a custom villager mod into this a bit like the lotr mod, to make all the biomes and towns and villages even more immersive! I cannot wait to play this map. Its looking Brilliant.
Kinda looks like da ford nit map 😳
I wish I had the patience to do stuff like this
where can i get this map
YEAAAAH  IM GONNA TAKE MY HORSE TO THE OLD TOWN ROAD IM GONNA-
this is absolute craziness
I can't play it for myself though
Heute, can you add an Ice Spike biom in the See behind the snowy Mountains? That would be very cool. If you do it, could you make it with a little Viking theme?
Using elytras in this world would be fire 🔥
You can't make ultimate survival world  Without customize The End and Nether
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🔥👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Please make it bedrock and also put it pn mediafire because what if some people dont have patrion
Where can i download map
My guy is literally rewriting  the plot of Skyrim just to build this thing
Can’t wait to download this and do a series on it
Can you put some a mod that on every boime the theme music will change like the western theme on the Mesa Boime and etc and I have a suggestion to put the mod "create" to make all realistic but be aware before you try it first use a back up file so if it fails it won't ruin your project.
Oh my god youre so creative
Amongus
Please do colab with SystemZee cuz it can be the best no modificated map in hole MC universe
Yo how bout add mods on it like hostile NPCs for every Biome and some weapons
My guy is creating a entire videogame.
If this guy 2ere tye one who made Minecraft it would be this awesome
Honestly thought that you would build a water dam, but it doesn't matter. Keep up the good work.
You should make the end portal on an island that is far away from the main land
For the snow biome use the idea from the beast (sorry don't know) caben
i will stabb my eyes out if i see a hate comment
This isn’t mc anymore
The 7000th Comment   lol
Imagine zombies on this OML that would be fun
You should do a series of you making your own mod with everything everyone has wanted with cool custom dungeons and villages and biomes and portals and other world and ores and story line and new blocks,trees,cactus , i also feel you could make a cool NPC mod, it would be sick and so on!!
This is absolutely amazing! I thought about doing something like this myself but not on this scale lol. I'm not that creative.
He asked for 250k 4 days ago and now he has 2 mil XD
Immagine if this man tried to build Rapture from bioshock
Can i Play this Map ?
Somebody better hack this map so we can play for free poor people
This is probably my favorite one yet, I'm so happy that you and Steph are so kind enough to take time out of your day for this massive project, you two are truly creative and good at what you do, and cant wait to see what's in store for the channel next year! 😁👏👏👏
How about a town with two or more places of worship, maybe like a big grand one and a small other one showing that there's a dominant religion and a minor religion in that area, or showing that people have travelled and traded because in the real world that usually spreads religions  You could even do a massive ruined city with a small city on its outskirts to show there is a period of decline
Greek style temple for the mountains
you should make a dredge
What did you do this year? Him: not much just upgrading minecraft survival...
Grow a beard and you’d look just like Jon snow which would be very cool
Have you ever considered cooperating with modders to turn your projects into a sort of structure generation overhaul? That would be sick :)
روعة 😍😍😍
holy damn
Your build always perfect sir
Will the world be free for just pe
Looks epic Also if it's possible, maybe make a modded compatibility version of the map or something along those lines? Would be amazing to play this and then go into a transformed twilight forest.
I wanna build this but i am so busy :<
Minecraft 2
Wow, everything looks so good! Bit confused though: is it just going to be your patreons that can download it? Thats sad, I can't become a patreon :(
This is really insane and getting really beautiful. I showed my dad your builds and he said ‘that aint minecraft anymore, thats real life’ and i loved that he said that hahaha.
i cant wait to play this map 😁😁😁😁
is this going to be free when its over?
Take my sub and do more of ur good work!!!
Price?🤨
The one thing your missing from the town is a graveyard
When is the map coming out?
You know, there was a mod called The Legend of The Notch, I don't want to say anything but this map has enormous potential for being map for another mod like the one mentioned, I'm sure some modders might be intrested.
Maybe you could do a cave with glow berries. Sorry I speak German.
You my friend are a architect in Minecraft keep up the good work 😁🙏
I would love to see a pagan place of worship. Something like a totem pole or a stonehenge sort of thing
You should really upgrade the nether!
Please use gurdwara as next worship place.
So, he's building alone, but says "help us out", "we" n stuff... I sure do hope it's not what I think it is...
I seriously can't wait to play this, man. I'm so hyped. I've got 2022 cut out for me!
I wish the trains can come to life using mods or something itd be cool creating mods for npc’s and trains and all that it’d be a game in a game
I have a Idea (History Idea) for the Snowy Mountains! The People who lived there. Believed that Gods inhabit the mountains. From over a thousand years ago they have been climbing mountains above 3000 meters. The objective behind their climbing has been to undertake a pilgrimage in line with their faith and not simply to pursue leisure.
please trixyblox i want a mosque because im a muslim i see that you only build one in the series please make one
My high ass thought the train was movin🤣🤣🤣good work trixy
God
14:11 what's the point of this massive railway system if the two areas are connected and most of it just does a circle around nowhere ?
People like you should be designing schematics for the minecolonies mod haha
One small detail is that your reference actually has no cacti In it’s environment as it is too cold
Add villager knights
Can you add a mosque, this can be just like a regular mosque or it could be something like the grand mosque in Abu Dhabi. I don’t mind which biome it’s in, it can be in any you want. Could you also make a town thats atheist, maybe with a side plot about a secret religious organisation. Or you could do the opposite: a highly religious town with a secret group of atheists or a different religion that’s plotting to rebel or try to take over or something. I think this could be interesting.
How facinating it would be if we can ride that train and explore the map
Just nice to see that some guy in the internet is going insane with his building skills in minecraft, nice work!
This is what we wish fortnite was
Id really like a Iglo Village in the Snowy Taiga
A hindu shiva temple
I think you should add a diamond veins that look like a giant person covered underground which will look like a giant's fossil
Will i be able to get the map for free?
This is INSANELY high effort, great job.
Oh my God! I love this series! I just would like to know if you are working a fulltime Job / studying at college because you spent so much time so far on this project! If yes: my respect!  Which biomes are left?
Will you build a bamboo forest? I think if you build it, it's going to be awesome!
What about nether and end
What about nether biome in the nether world?
I would love to see the final product, even though i don't even play minecraft, i mean i would like too but i cant xd anyways, it's Awesome
Absolutely loved the builds and video but hear me out… a ranch would be an awesome add on
Im so exited to se the snowy mountians
Looking for inspiration? Look no further than red dead redemption 2
The mesa gives me westbound vibes
is this is red dead
I was watching the video very intently, and then suddenly I hear ‘Chicken Big Mac’
Geez Trixy the sheer amount of work put into the train stations and railroads alone is spectacular and the details in all the little cranes and mine cart tracks is amazing kept it up
I love the bridge however I don’t feel like there isn’t enough gap one might say in the bridge because you can’t really see through it where as if you were to look up one on google imagines you can. Not trying to be toxic just giving a recommendation.
Maybe you can make a camp site just an idea tho.
Amazing quality video, map... Everything!
When we can now play the game is it on mobile
does anyone know if they are planning on doing anything in the nether/end? Since the pharaoh summoned a wither and such
No entendí nada pero pues aquí andamos 👍🤑
for the savanna biome, you should add little holes from prairie bdogs and animals like that
Idea: idk if this was already suggested before or something similar but what if one of the more relatively advanced biomes can incorporate powered rails into their inter-biome mining network entrance(s). Maybe a neighbouring biome can even steal and use some powered rails to some extent
(Edit) I commented this on the last one and I’m gonna do it again. You should completely lock the end until the player has collected certain artifacts from each biome. This will force us to play the entire map without an elytra and see this world the way it was meant to be seen. It will also make the End feel much more rewarding to explore (Edit) To anyone who would like to comment “you really want to WALK all 16 million blocks? U so dum” please go back and rewatch the first episode… the island is 4000x4000 with a total area of 16 million, it is not 16,000,000x16,000,000. Also y’all are forgetting horses… sure not anybody’s favorite transportation, but better than nothing. So! Let’s do the math yeah? Walking coast to coast will take you ~16 minutes. Sprint jumping coast to coast ~10 minutes. Riding an average horse coast to coast ~7 minutes. Riding a max speed horse around the entire perimeter of the island assuming it is a full 16,000 blocks ~20 minutes. And finally an elytra from coast to coast for all you speed demons out there ~2 minutes. Yes it’s faster. But at what cost? To see these 100s and possibly 1000s of hours fly by in a blur just so you can get where you want to go a few minutes sooner? Okay, you go ahead and do that. Personally I’d like to feel like I’ve earned that speed first
Holy Shit, this looks incredible!!! I’ve been needed a new Vr Minecraft map to play in, and I think I just found it! Can’t wait, it’ll be gorgeous!
This is fucking awesome
Can you put this on bedrock and on iPad?
Am I the only that though this was a Fortnite map? XD
Cant wait until the release of the map in 2021-2022 and i got really good shaders
I cannot believe I went so long without knowing this magnificent project existed, my dude I am staying until the end.
The map on the thumbnail image looks slightly like the fortnite chapter 3 map
Next baiom Hindu please
The only map where your build is garbage compared to everything else
You should wear a suit you would look spiffy
yoooo he hit hes like goal (250k)
Which program do you use to get that overview look?
Finally
Idea: personally, I don't mind if the map has some commands. You could use trains as a means of transportation. Ex: putting a /tp and a /time set command block inside the train's seat so when you sit, it would seem like u slept and woke up when you arrived.
Love watching your series trix keep it up and can’t wait for the final map😃😀. Love the content❤️❤️
Ah not bad good markus persson will be so proud of you
Creative in a another LEVEL
You should do a volcano Island, with burnt trees and withered life, with a dark force living on it
snowy tanga: orthodox church?
I haven’t played a lot since Minecraft first came out, but I always watch your videos. It’s inspiring to see what one mind can do
You are going to need new detailed skins for the mobs in such a beautiful map
Why hasnt mojang recruited you yet
i feel bad for your pc. mine would just explode on that render distance
Please c an you do nether bioms in the nether
What is the next biome ??
Are you ganna add deep dark?
With the new caves and cliffs update he's gonna have to do something like a deep underground city. Also. Speaking of new update. Will this be accessible with the new update?
This seems very Red Dead Redemption inspired, I love it
awesome
You’ve done an excellent job on this whole series. The only thing I can really see missing from the Mesa town would be a livery stable. But I’m super excited to play this
Can i join mojang mc
Imagine dream doing a special  manhunt episode here
holy wow!
It would be cool if he makes it to where we can talk with the people of USW
You should try contacting forge labs to do a hundred day series when it’s done
So if you did the end and nether that’d be sick as fuck
easily my best find of 2021
When it’s finished u should put it on the Minecraft market place for bedrock
Awww, sad this is only for patreons
What about the nether and the end?
Is this map free??
Can you get this world in bedrock?
the map is sus
What does he mean next map!??
Me adding maybe 10 trapdoors to my walls: Wow that detail looks great Trixy:
One thing: That mine and its cranes/buildings looks like a project that would be manned by a population much MUCH greater than what that nearby town or even several towns could support. Kind of throws off the believability in my head.
im sure people will invent speedrunning for your map in no time
So epic man, appreciate you 🤙
Can't wait to see the map when it's been finished🤩🤩🤩
Espero que cuando este completo lo den para minecraft java y minecraft bedrock y que se pueda descargar esta maravilla
Bro why you didn't add Indian culture like temple's, statues, etc.
2:49 I presume you do more building than surviving?
You should take inspiration from wakanda
Good luck!!
For the snowy mountains, for the place of worship, you should do a monk temple, (you probably already had/used this idea, it's been a while since I watched this series)
Can’t wait to play this it seems  fire 🔥
Amazing job your extremely talented! Got yourself a sub
first time in my life had my jaw dropped… I’m astonished dude
In the Taiga or the Ice biome you should do a Norse religion cause i feel that would be super fitting
That isnt minecraft                                                                        That is art
god damn
Minedead Redemption is looking hella good
I love how only 2 People are able to add such cool things, but a huge damn Company like Microsoft isn't. I guess they don't give a shit. lol-  Keep up the Hype, really excited to play this very soon!
This man has made breath of the wild 2 on minecraft, amazing!
ark basically
Dman wish there was a download
it looks good
As a finishing tounch
These are always great to see. That said. Pleased pace yourself. We love these, but we understand that you're one guy. Please don't be stressed about meeting some kind of goal. Just do it because you enjoy it. We can wait.
WOW
Japan Themed Taiga please!
Isnt the leather place called a tailor
What would you do in a world like this though? I feel like in a world, you'd try getting the best armor and build things, but this world doesn't really seem like one that you would try to survive in, but more of a showcase.
this mine remind me this Mario kart circuit in a mine
I would love to see a shrine or temple for a certain god or goddess as a place of worship. This is outstanding! Love the series!
I could never do this I’m mind blown
Add cemetery recommendation
Absolutely amazing work!! Love all the work and ideas!!
How you can make this but minecraft he cant make a good village:/
Anyway to get this on console?
flying in survival?
You guys should do something in the swamp or something for witches like a whole coven of them.
You could a a mosque in another village to create variety in religion
Amazing!!
Yoooo the details are crazy! do the savannah and nether in 1 vid, the taiga and mountains in 1 and possibly the end?
Keep up the good content merry Christmas 🎁
Keep up the videos,the content is really good
Maybe you can add some mod into the map?
This map would be great with custom npcs and some mods to add a bit of more creativity. I can't wait to for the finished product.
We need some nordic and viking type stuff in the northern parts of the map
"Relatively small scale" just wait and watch how this world cripples my PC day after day, I'll show you small scaled
The town reminded me of valentine from rdr2
that western town gives me red dead redemption vibes. i just love the western theme.
before you said don't panic about the saloon I was actually panicking🤣
Probably not a very original idea, but I think you need to go with a Viking village for the snowy mountains. I absolutely love the looks of the new world and hope to see more of it soon💯💯
Good job 👍🔥
You should put a piece of hay below the vampire in the train so that the smoke goes higher
Wtf 1 year bro why you do thta muxh work and also i do a little hard work but o getting support
251K likes :)
Where is the doctor
Orthodox Church pls
Oh Cool a probably 500x500 map, kinda normal but coo-  "16 Million blocks”   Wtf
The Create Mod with this entire biome is going to be insane.
Imma be honest you NEED to get into hermitcraft with those building skills ;D
Who's still waiting for Mojang to hire him?
Here is an idea: Another biome  A massive cave underneath the map
bro omg this jungle temple I don't know why they are not like that in minecraft
Neat
It's 250 already. Time for a lot of work. Goodbye
Make a Server  out of your map  A adventure Server
"in the past water towers were used to store water" - trixyblox, 2021
Can you add traveling merchants in between the different biomes as their traveling
I'll say it again)) i would like to see an orthodox church
Is this available for bedrock edition? I would really like to play this map, and as almost 70% of us here play bedrock, I was just wondering if it was available for it. :D   This map is AMAZING by the way, I would love to play it.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!! 🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
It eould be really cool if you built a Japanese village in the snowy mountains with hot springs and stuff
wow, just WOW. Amazing, the best episode.
I totally forgot about this series but it's so good 😭😭
That is so cool!
also also snow - nordic countries? maybe take some inspiration from the sami???
Do a pirate hideout
I know youve done the witch island, but id like to see a little witches hut on the outskirts of a city with a herb garden and pretty crystals, not all witches are scary and some are sought out for help and stuff so i just think it would be nice to see
How does he do the copy and paste thing like is it commands or a mod
Is the map gonna be free?
Now I’m wondering about the End and End city’s- 😦
make a ski hill in the mountains
Idea:put an Ancient Maya ruin in the canyon biom I forgot what the name was
Check if you're still subbed I was unsubbed
it would be epic to make it like fallout with randomly scattered small buildings each with some lore, to fill the gaps between towns and larger structures
I made a city then it got currupted hope it doesn’t happen to you because Minecraft forced me to delete it
What i gonna happen to The nether?
Trixy and Steph, well done with the USW project. You are both amazing and deserve all the support for this!
Russian church (worship place suggestion)
Surely put it on the mc store for free
Yeah and now build it in Survival )
Maybe to snowy mountains ad super huge ice castle surrounded by deep and enormous lake.
you should do the dream religion style of church
Is it just me, or does TrixyBlox look like a young George Daniel from The 1975?
hi fore a place of woreship you cud do some tradishennel nothern stuff
Merry Christmas
as someone who typically plays with mods, I'm 100% using Create to have those trains become actually functional once the map is done
U should have done a exploded bridge and a fallen train with a story of it's own, something like: outlaws robbed it and turn it into a treasure hunt
Wow👍👍👍😯😯😲😲
Can we just take a moment to apriciate the dudes effort to make a fun minecraft advendure map. He deserves a salute
When i first saw the thumbnail, i thought it was fortnite map XD, still tho, INSANE
POG ELITE INSANE AMAZING WOW
Cant wait to play this mape. lovely!!!
I would still like to see a viking village longhouse and hof in the snowy mountains
The snowy mountains should get a massive castle
This is a Christmas present
Man every single map and mod i want always have a price :(
these may only come out once ish a month and aren't very long (but aren't short) but they are still the best content on youtube. Merry christmas and thanks for the amazing vids
When Do You Think u finish that we can play the map or Do you made a extra Video With the seed from the map
The patreon inscription is too expensive :(
how do i join the world
Sub goal almost there!
now you only need a professional modder and you have an isane mmo in minecraft xD (i know its just vanilla but its insane good job!)
I am sorry but you forgot the livery stable! It is a staple to the Wild West. A place for the town’s people to keep there horses
Major props brother
Lol i can't even effort Buying the real Minecraft game but i always love watching it...Sad always on trial game😭🤧
the mesa is just bloky red dead redemption
when you will do the snowy mountains do a civilization in the mountain
For the snowy mountains area you should make it like Skyrim
The USW is gonna get so cool
;-; SO CLOSE!!!
ok just imagine someone gets this working in vr
How would we be able to get the map when it's finished
You are a fucking legend!
It looks great but I feel like the railroad tracks are too wide/too big
can i download the maps on minecraft pe?
I remember seeing ur first ever video on this and I can' t believe how far you've gotten already!
You should really do a pagan temple
Man, why don’t you do the caves?
Is this going to be available on bedrock to?
upgrade your face
How will we be able to play this map
A cool idea would be to make so that the different biomes comunicated with each others. Ideas could be with a Secret underground Redstone system, or using Real Tall towers in differents styles wich calls would have been to house a Fire to see from miles away to send messages. (One in each village and then one every max render distance or so, each leading towards the central plains village. From lore, it could be established tha different light sources could have meant different things, but mainly red and blue fire (linking it in story to the nether))
But does it have ores?
It would be really cool if there was a second town but overall really cool
will this map include caves under the whole map?
Man can't i get this map for free i am in love with it 💓.
very cash money
Re épico 😎
Wow amazing
The best video
Will this world be downloadable for us to play with??
I don’t know how you do this, I get such a massive headache if I play Minecraft for 2 hours.
I'm so excited even tho I won't and can't play it
Now Dream has to do a speedrun in this world.        Based.
for the snow maintain biome you should make a lds temple
Buddha temple for snowy mountaibs
OMG, this is absolutely incredible
Would it not be cool if there was a derailed train at the buttom af the canyon?
I can’t wait🔥🔥🔥
Aku selalu suka dengan video mu, itu seperti sihir. Aku punya ide bagaimana untuk membuat desa Yeti tersembunyi. Mereka adalah warga yang dikutuk dan akhirnya mereka bermigrasi ke gunung salju
Java only?                        If it only for java I guess I only gonna use my eye and look people play this survival
MYSTERIOUS ICE MAN IN THE SNOW BIOME
respect
Dude come on my guy you forgot about my favorite part my culture the native americans
I waitin for this
you could have added a stables to the town
Monasteries should be a no brainer place of worship and peace for mountain biome... Anyways great vid....looking forward to them.
When you’re going to do the savanna I recommend you look up some photos of read the redemption 2 - black water
this is awesome
Reckon this would crash the pocket edition if u tried to download it?
I think Monjang Studios should hire him
When you give download
🤠👍🏿
As I was watching and hearing about the Savannah area, why not take some inspiration from Australia and its history? They have some cool cultural beliefs that may add some cool things to the savannah. It's still your amazing build, and can hardly wait for the next video.
Hytale
I hope Mojang add these features in Minecraft it will be mind blowing
Imagine playing this on VR
I want to see ocean upgrade like monument shipwerk
It would be incredibly cool to have ice caves in the snowy mountains biome. And then have an ancient civilization having lived there, but not humans. Perhaps another species.
It's very good but minecraft is a Medieval game no ?
Hey just want to know, is there gonna be a bedrock release too or just a Java release for the world?
Can u add a icy castle and village in the snowy mountain
This man is just the best builder minecraft Gas Event seen
Where can I get this world
Me want it lol
Shoutout man, that is a giant project wish u the best
Dude its SICK its gets more relistic i hope we have that for free on minecraft
Wow congrats on 2 million!!! Last time I checked you only had one million !!!! YAY
this world is a geological fever dream
Tu est un super buildeur
THIS GUY IS THE GOD OF BUILDER
Do you think that when you are done, you could release this as Java map?
Sus
Just incredible
Birst nest, skulls ans cow could be great addition to that and also some tipee and maybe a military fort like in spirit the horse
i was born in a small mining town- when the build starts making you feel nostalgic you know you've done it right
You really need to add in some bandit camps!
very ambitious and creative. i'm out of words. that was incredible!!!
"You guys can download this on patron when its done so you can play it" Me: I can't imagine the file size of this world
"kedarnath temple " in the snow biome it represent the  hindu culture of india and it will look beautifull
To be honest. If we were gonna play this map. I dont know which biome I would settle in. Maybe a bunch of worlds. A  home in every biome
100 days in trixy world
Minecraft should hire you if they did they’re Minecraft 1.18 update will be much much insane
For a second I was like "oh shit i can download this"and then i realized    I'm poor
We need the tutorial: “How I didn’t give up spending 2021 upgrading everything in Minecraft
The windmills, trains, etc... Will be alive? I mean if the trains will move or could be used with some mods or something. Really cool biome btw <3
its crazy how anywhere you look is just full of little by little pieces of hard work
That looks like a fortnite map somehow 😂
awesome!
Him: makes ultimate Me: wanting to download when it comes out Him: shows how to download from Patreon from paying money and perks Me: oh hell   Now everybody would say "lol, kid is broke"  Ok so I'm in Pakistan and 1 dollar is worth 170 and my mother does earn much and I can buy it but it doesn't mean that you gotta rip others with money
Make a underground secret vault in the masia and make it one of the main quests
an indian camp would have been cool
Didnt you miss a horse station or something like that. You always have alot off horses in western movies tho
Strong hold We need a strong hold it can have a massive custom portal
He forgot a brothel
Can you put the church in Grimbergen in the snowy mountains
I'm surprised there isn't any back to the future reference in here
Is it weird that these villages remind me of rdr2?
Plzz can you put thix map on Minecraft Bedrock Shop!
I have a proposal,where can I speak to you
I hope that this can be in creative as well
Lets go I'm so excited to play it
For the snowy biome you could take inspiration from GOT. Like the whole winterfell, the ice wall etc.
I am SO hyped for it!! Already spoke 2 friends about playing on this map and isksjsjxjf i cant- im so hyped and so amazed by your creativity!!!!! The BEST 🥺
me: hmm let me do that! not even me five minute later: how on earth does he do that? *dies of boredom*
Mcbe?
I love how you put so much efort in this projects👍👏
Reminds me of red dead redemption my favorite game
Fun fact  usw means And so on in german
Does anyone know if there is a way to download this map and get it to pull up on my mobile. The locker edition one. Or is it strictly bedrock or Java
A little building Idea: maybe some teepees and indian villages would look very good in this area
Good thing he didnt go out and start making mineral and treasure system
If taiga biome isn't viking theme I will be dissapointed.
Imagine someone making an rpg out of this map, would be insane!
This video was basically a more fun way of teaching history
I wish your the creator on minecraft and build stuff that is new
Add a mod for different boats
Can you do a Genshin Impact Minecraft world pls?
3-4 years ago I watched you and mine craft content. Revisited for the nostalgia and the content is still entertaining.
This is so beatiful
When the world is over, I'm looking forward to someone who will modify the map to add mods like Create, or MMORPG mods
i really want to play on this world but I don't really have the original paid mc  I have the Tlauncher one and I'm curious if I will be able to play
Man your dedication is high
What verson is this map
imagine mix this map with create and other mechanic mods <3 <3
This man needs one million likes not 250 000K
if you were into Redstone you could have made the caves collapse
The last thing you should transform is the snowy mountains ! They just give me a final area feeling...? Like put some sort of powerful force on top of the mountain and yeah.... i really dont know.
Surprised you didnt add stables!
How to download this world pls pls
I'm so obsessed with these videos. I LOVE this project ❤❤❤
It’s like red dead redemption but Minecraft in some way
This is almost the perfect map for a Wild West movie or role play like whaaaaaa duudde you really made this place like the most realistic Wild West it really gives me the Wild West vibes
Well i’m kinda dumb and dont listen how so i get the wrold
Download pls
It’a onigashima
Looks like fortnite map xD
Amazing 😟
WE NEED A TRAIN HEIST SCENE
So cool man this series is insane
You should be on Hermitcraft
THIS IS SO COOL!!! KEEP UP THE AMAZING WORK!!!
Absolutely live the wild west, this will be my most favorite biome
I wish the biomes merged more organically, and not in a straight line UK map drawing vashion
Wow this whole series (also love the Mesa) is amazing!
I will not play this world unless I turn off mobgriefing...
since the Taiga biome was mostly inhabited by Nomads such as the Mongolians, why not incorporate their religion of shamanism and worshipping the sky?
Never ceases to amaze me, it’s so satisfying to see a build you do come together. Love it so much and keep up the amazing work :)
i cant wait for this to be finished, keep it up man
I really love this series, but im afraid i cant join the patreon. Im so sorry i cant help in that way, but i will do what i can to like and share your videos. Keep up the great work!☺🥰
I wonder are you gonna do anything for the nether and end or just the over world
You will take money to get this map? Please don't take I am poor
I DIDNT SAW THE NOTIFICATION !!!
A Hindu Temple
For the snow it would be cool if you make a gods ruin like a huge sword with giant fingers frozen around the sword area
I love u man ❤️ Happy Christmas
Anyone else get cerro gordo vibes?
the map looks like Fortnite
Will the map be on bedrock?
IMHO, this is the worst biome he created... Railroad bridges are totally kill the beauty and atmosphere of western environment
Be sure to believe, have faith and trust God and and repent of your sins so that when he comes back if you have been doing these you have been saved already.  and all sins are forgivable (except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) because of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.    and don't worship the antichrist when he comes he will force the world to worship and give them the mark of the Beast which doesn't let you go to Heaven.  And I'm not forcing you by the way God did give us free will 😎👍                                                     But it is better to know God before he comes back with wrath  And Jesus was nailed onto a cross because of our sins and he lived a perfect and sinless life and he isnt mad that we were the reason he died on the cross, after he died he was brought back to life and he wants us to put our faith in him and to trust his sacrifice so when we die we can enter Heaven.  And we can Know while we are still here. Don't let Jesus be a stranger to you. Don't let him   say "Depart from me for I do not know you"  But let him say   "Welcome home my good and faithful servant"  Have a Great day!   Sorry if I annoyed you   Summed up  don't worship antichrist (the one who gives a marking if you do (the mark being 666) if you do, you will go to hell later. And have faith in Jesus Christ to go to heaven  God has answered some of my prayers and I've felt the Holy Spirit and hes sent me signs and there are Bible prophecies that have come true).   . And sorry if I annoyed you.  And don't listen to music with sin in the lyrics (sex, drugs, murder and other sins) it's a sin but it's forgivable but just because a sin is forgivable doesn't mean you should commit it that's abusing Gods grace/forgiveness or it could be.  And the same applies for cussing, using Gods name in vain, lying, sex before Marriage and sex with multiple people .
Built west type theme village
I’m not a huge west fan or what ever but it’s so sick real history is in all of these but this one especially for me so hype
I really want in one of them a viking style area
I want to build something like the Mesa biome you made but 100% by hand in survival, and more colorful, with a functional railroad system, having around 50 structures in the town, probably starting after Christmas 😂
Forbidden well that makes you go on a drugged trip side quest
he makes it look so easy
Aw man this looks like settings from a fantasy film
My god this is sooooo coool
I want someone to actually make this into an adventure map when it's all said and done. Even though I won't be able to pay it regardless
You should reach out to Minecraft and try to get them to partner with you after you release it to your patrons for a little while so this can get more downloads and plays.
This world is being designed to be a survival world, but I feel like it's too massive and has wayyy too much stuff to explore in survival
Do the trains actually move?
OMGG IT'S HEREEE I'VE BEEN WAITING, THIS NEVER DISAPPOINTS ! 💯💯
GTA 6: Cubes
Hay can make World like this for Minecraft pocket edition please reply to your new subscriber
I love all of this except the purple hotel, as purple was a  extremely rare colour to get a hold of only being available in modern day Isreal
Just imagine how much need storage just 1 map he crate
There is one more place you need to add you probably don’t know what it is but guess what it is it’s a volcano in Rocky Mountains in the water if you don’t have that you forgot what I was helpful for you doing it also you got a Add some underwater buildings because where would the underwater zombies be (drowns)
oh nah they got Minecraft native genocide
Moe Jang is actually lazy but you are better than his building techniques look at this 16 million blocks +2,000,578 blocks the extra blocks are the builds
will this work with the new update? if it does i’ll buy patreon for this
Such an incredible use of build technique and background research, you have my congratulations sir, a brilliant build project!
I think some sort of underground bunker or fallout inspired part would be good, probably not as high tech as the actual fallout games to fit the vibe more, but somewhere the sun doesn’t shine much that people live would be cool, maybe a cave dwelling village?
Merry Christmas
Best game ever
Each one of these videos far out ranks the last
My only problem here is I can't built anything as cool as what exists so I'd just end up living in something you built, broken ego in hand.  Real talk tho, PHENOMENAL job
the jungle looks sick
This is litterally just ark’s map….
I just thought of something for this map that would help tie it all together and that's using the middle lake to possibly use and test the new swamp features coming in a few months with "the wilds" update it would provide a whole area for emersion especially one to show case all the cool little tid bits you could throw in to make it feel that much more natural maybe even some secrets
in the snowy mountains i hope he can put trees knocked over with “foot prints” like bigfoot
The project
When you finish
Make it a minecraft map
Are you going to add the lush biome ?
You Can build a prison please .. And a cowboy camp ?
Maybe a Buddhist temple? Haven’t seen anything Buddhist realated in Minecraft yet
Favorite biome so far! Keep it up!
Howwwwwwwwwwwww
Can we use this on Pe 😟
Started 7 months ago and has progress really well, congratulations man, keep it up and I wish you luck.
Not to be that guy, (I just want to say that this is so cool and really incredible what you've done before I say this) but how would the town and everything get the wood to build in the Masa, since there's no trees there? I don't know if you're going for a super realistic thing here, but if you are.. Again I am sorry for asking this, you have done an incredible job on this!
I hope someone make a mod for him to enhance it more... i really want to play it once it was finished
Place like land of ooo
Man just created minecraft version of red dead redemption 2
If somebody made a mod for this, that would be epic.
From INTP   The legend is back from covid hell I wandering if he going to build a type of maze   U are probably out of ideas and can have a d*mn effect of fear so one of your options is start a new channel have a nice day  .
just a small suggestion, seeing as how they are quite popular among professional builders, I think it would be neat if you did a floating island area maybe in the mountains. That would add a unique spice to this world
when it'll be finished? I cant wait for playing it...
Totally off topic but some mf finna use the thumbnail of this video and call it the fortnite chapter 4 map💀
Didn’t you say you were going to build a cattle ranch here?
Do a 100 days on this map
This is so relaxing and satisfying to watch😊
Love your vids dude
YouTube in the old days be like This is what I called a video
In the cold biomes put a Viking thing to it and I think the Vikings had a religion
Umm I just say this in my recommendation and watched a bit is this like a map or mod your making for Minecraft???
Noo he forgot stables
Finnally
I really hope it’ll be available on bedrock edition cause id really like to play this on my ps4
wowww
Red dead redemption in Minecraft
Do snowy mountains next with Buddhism as the main culture in the Village
А ты дашь нам скачать эту карту как закончишь?
Is that the saloon from buried
Make that a server pls it would be good
that's some realy cool stuff, but the "wild west" idea seems too off not only from the whole map, but also from vanilla minecraft. It's just too unsuitable in terms of technology and culture development level, so it breaks the whole atmosphere
nah it became an rpg world
Looks awesome I was wondering if you could do like a Greek or Roman style temple? Maybe🙏🏻
This man should get paid 10m for building all of this
just a little idea to add (if there is not something already being made on the biome) is an olympus - like temple, but all torn apart with a giant hole on the roof made by a Giant sakura tree, an experiment to bring life to a frozen wasteland gone "wrong", with the whole tree taking over the temple with it´s roots, destroying said temple and the village that rested at the base of the mountain said temple was on
Wait so this will be playable someday?? WHEN!!!
This is fucking epic bruv
You and Jeracraft are the best in building!!!!
U new youteber? I Wil sub enjoy!
My question is can u actually play survival in it? Would be sick
Every time your video is released, I am so interested in those! I hope you will still stay like this and forever! Hope you will be the most famous youtuber in all the youtube community.
Noice! Could I get the world download?
What is the name of the map?
Will you upgrading or adding underground cave city?
That pan at 14:05 was incredile, it kinda remind me of how the city looked in walle hehe
Would be cool if there was a train that had went off the tracks in a sharp corner.
Please please please let me be able to download on mobile once it’s finished
Bruh i wanted it free but i understand that it takes too much of work to be "free"
This is awesome
Dude your builds are so big that I watch the hole video
Your builds are so cool
Please tell me you'll get this somehow ported into console
Jeeze, that is crazy, have a like and a subscription
From all the biome you improve before on this project this one is hitting me different,it gave me chils just to see the west town....
so nobody‘s gonna adress the fact that the map looks like bionicle gen2‘s okoto?
What a wonderful great work! Good job bro.
Wait, I thoght it is free to download? Have I to pay now? Can someone answer please?
I don't know why but I really feel like playing "capture the flag" in the mesa biome but we all just use stone swords and crossbows (' ▼ '
The snowy biome should be Japan themed with the Torii Gate and shrines and a really large castle. It can be Hokkaido themed! Just a suggestion but it would be cool to see a Torii gate in the USW
absolutely great!
only if this was a real thing in minecraft :(
Are you going to explore this place
The thumbnail looked like a fortnite map
Aw I hope this gets added to the Minecraft PS4 marketplace, I WOULD HAPPILY BUY THIS!
Love your work!! Can't wait till it's all finished!!!
I’m definitely setting up a server when the map download is released this is amazing think it would be a lot of fun with friends
zamn
would be cool if you also updated The Enderdragon world so when u fight the ED it’s a lot more cool
Hello!,so i was wondering where will the world be accecible?.and what consoles can you play it on? If on ps4, Can you make it free?
dude! you are nuts my guy, this content is unreal. I can't thank you enough for sharing the vastness of your curiosities and creativity, it is both inspiring and motivating to say the least.
A Buddhist - Nepal themed mountains would be so amazing
One thing I must say is:  Yee haw
Since some builds were inspired by botw when you get to ice mountains you can make some sort of shrine  luke there was in mt lanayru
Staring it is enough to make me enjoy the survival world.
I’m really sad I won’t be able to play this because I’m on console😭 but I love watching these videos
I'm always amazed on how they do it and so grateful that he has done this because it really needs it
Will the costome map have 1.18 caves? I hope it does because I'm willing to download the map since it looks so cool!
This far exceeded my expectations for the mesa. Even despite my hoping you would tackle the snow biome with viking inspired buildings and towns. I think this one has been your best so far. Amazing work.
i can barelly build a house and your here building this shit
Communism
This man actually made the mesa biome interesting!
This looks like the most advanced town in the whole island
Merry Christmas Eve Everyone!!💙💙
You should have a underwater City
first off this is completely fucking gorgeous! I love all western aesthetics and seeing this recreated in Minecraft is just another element of cool.
✨
Yes I love it
Can you please add it on Addons app?
Noice
I hope the wild update updates biomes that really need a upgrade. Like the desert
You should put a yeti in the snowy mountains
bitch this shit slaps
A deep dark city whitout skulk, thats all i will say
Very very impressive man
When is it scheduled to be fully released? Can’t wait 😁 I’ll donate a sum when it does!
How are the sidequests going to work?
An other beautiful job but if you think about it in the messa biome there is no threes however all the buildings are made of wood so where did they find the wood ? Maybe the train should be link to other Forest biome i don’t know. I love your job
Ive been to a western town called vringinna city Nevada
is this in 1.18?
Add dinosaurs
Great! Only thing is that I would’ve liked to of seen more barns and houses in the village but apart from that absolutely amazing!
Fucks sake this man needs to be hired.
For the snowy mountains you should add a cave with alot of mobs trapped in ice
When and how do we play it
This map will be free to download?
will the map be available on bedrock
These videos are both relaxing to watch yet idea-inducing for my own builds. Love it.
Absolutely insane
You are very talented Trixyblox
can it be played on m ok Minecraft bedrock?
BUILD ORTHODOX CHURCH
Yay new vid! Ive been watching this series for a while now
seed ?
:0
I am never convinced about how he does the floors. I understand he is going for this "imperfect/as natural as possible" texture, but it looks like random carpet tiles.
You ever heard of Build The Earth?
this map would be really cool to be played in VR
I wanna buy this but  I don't have a credit card how do you even get a credit card 😕😕
Бро, ты прекрасно строишь, на русском Ютубе никто так красиво не строит.👌
Im gonna buy the patreon and then redistribute your builds so people dont have to pay for a stupid build :)
This world gives me massive fallout vibes. Kind of wish there was a ruined city now like fallout 3.
Add some spots where you can get iron and rail tracks and make a bit of area in the masa where you have to explore that area your self
You could take inspiration from Waianae from black panther for the planes biome
Ye
Should add a horse stable
for the savanna biome your place of worship could be a tribe looking alter
Pls do the sanctum Sanctorum doctor strange d home
put this whole map on bedrock store too!
Hey can you go back to the jungle and like add a Indian theme? An Indian myself, india is full of jungle with many towns
I want jedism as a religon
I think it would be cool to have a stable/barn at the town
Or maybe individual videos on different biomes
Hey when you actually release the map can you make a video that that can be optional to watch the actually shows us the whole map for those people that can't download it it would be very appreciated and helpful for me because I can't download it obviously because I don't have that option thing so it would be very appreciated if you did that
I love how you changed everything to the old times and you explain them as history and i like how it is only £4 a month to play this. So good job and merry christmas
Thank you for another great video! I love this series to bits!! Omg this looks so dang amazing and the storyline seems so friggin good!! Thank you so much for sharing and making this amazing world and hope you have a great new year💕😁
I absolutely cannot wait for the world to be finished, I love everything that's gone into it so far!
Have a great Christmas
Noticed that he copied the bar from Armadillo in rdr2😂
It would be so cool if only gold could be discovered in this biom and eg. only emeralds and diamonds in jungle and iron only in moutains making it challanging but rewarding to find that bioms :D
Your buildings are incredibly good and also the video is so much fun to watch. Respect buddie. 👏
You know stuff like this makes minecraft what it is today. Also you can always appreciate people like this.
Amazing!
Man, seriously just incredible congratulations 👏🏻👏🏻
Can we play on it
Looking sick
Can you make a ski resort? Thanks!
Please stop using close-ups of your face. It's disturbing.
Congrats man, you just got an extra subscriber just from the first 2 minutes from this video
I paused for a minute at 10:51
U need a jail
That is just an awful ripoff of Fortnite
Will this be available on bedrock?
I was wondering if you could build a futuristic bunker in the snow mountains
I can only dream of being able to make minecraft builds so epic.... ;(  @TrixyBlox - Do you have a Hardcore world where you just go 'Ham' on making utter insanity?
I bet people are gonna do a 100 day challenge in this world in only a few days
Your so good at this 😀
Is this going to be available on java. Bedrock or both? Because if it's only going to neon java I and probably many others will be incredibly disappointed
This makes me want to load up red dead 2 again
nether??
Put mine cart rails next to the other rails for functionality
Will the map work on pocket edition
Dude the railroad LESSS GOOOOOOO
You need horses and cowboy
Suggestion: the mesa should contain an old abandoned science facility (black mesa) paying homage to half life
Do you think you'll try to update this with content from the Wild Update? There's some stuff in that update I know I'm personally super excited for.
Could call it trestle canyon
bro i need this world in minecraft pocket edition can you do anything else
If you could give more than one like
Somewhere can you do a giant tree of life or something? I think it would be a great idea.
cant wait to play this map, looks Just amazing
when you do the savanna biome can you make a lion king rock
I beg someone make a modpack for this
What the seed please
he should scatter some random broken down buildings or tens around that biome just to give it more life i think,
that looks like the fortnite map
This is going to be the best map EVER in minecraft!!!!
good video
why did this video make me reinstall red dead 2?
Why does he sound like Tommyinnit?
I which that you build mad max in minecraft
It will be really cool if you added a ancient civilizations to one of the business as like a storyline
You forgot to add ice biomes
Trixy im not gonna lie ive never wantto see end results more ive always bee supper excited whenyou drop a new update video
This guy is hardcore, he even does the research on the different buildings and what they are used for, are you sh***** me🤨😃
You and Steph are working such a detailed back story for this world won’t you please, please, please put out an adventure map version of this world. I’m not the only one wanting to see this as an adventure map because all my friends I talk to say they want that as well!!
You should do something like a giant underwater/underground base or city.
Thanks for adding a photo of utah as your inspiration my home state
Dude to make the experience even more mind boggling i suggest you search for command block experts to make the train actually moving!
can you download the map?
Hey dude really can't believe
That’s a fortnite Mao not minecraft
I can’t wait to play the map
This is the first video  ive seen but im in love with the content
Is there a seed for this?
ima build this in survival    10 years later: I finished two biomes guys
Best biom i think
im so Fkng excited to play this map
I rarelly like videos but dude you deserved it af
This is just fricking insane no question
Savanna with aliens would be awesome
You didn't upgrade look of blocks tho
id definitely pay for your map if it was a one time payment and not a monthly subscription
After this I am waiting for the apex map or some other game ( fornite don’t do it plzzzzz
these are literally the most amazing videos to watch!
Masterpiece
Please stop doing bits where you show your face
does anyone know why he’s got no eyelashes on one of his eyes
I can’t believe this is minecraft, this is the best build I’ve EVER seen! I bet your proud of this masterpiece!
You deserve 100 million
#idea a Templar temple
Could this ever be ,whenever its released, put into bedrock edition?
I've definitely been chased by The Nurse around that Saloon, yep.
Reminds me a lot of borderlands and I love it
This should be a fortnite map, hear me out, Fortnite’s map will always be weird but if they made the map like the whole island that you have made it would probably make everyone happier. Keep up the good work and if it wasn’t for your insane grind a lot of us would be missing  something special.
Where is the natives/indians
I’d like to see a similar relationship between the Arctic and tundra as we have had with the Mesa and savanna, except with Vikings Inuits and a Shaolin temple and Yeit in the mountains of course or whatever is planed for it!
This is amazing! I just wish you had added a ranch, that would've been really cool
Hi
It would have bein even cooler if you put a derailed train in the water or a side of a moutain or a ferry
You know the content is good when you go to like the video having seen that you've hit the thumbs up  already about 4 times 👍💕
I liked when the likes were at 212,999 and it was so satisfying when it went to 3 xD
I think the next place of worship should be a mosque because a lot of racist people target muslims so it would be awesome to support them and maybe the story line could be about a raided town that was ruled by racist people but then got it's freedom it deserves back. I think it would be AWSOME!!
When you do the snowy mountain biome can you use references from the vikings, Assassins Creed Vahalla,Horizon Zero Dawn, and a little bit of Nioh not sure if yall read this comment but these are my ideas cause i cant do patreon yet
how are you so good at building
Mesa plateu known as west
Please do the snowy mountains next they will look so cool when there finished
How can I buy this map?
Good other then the facts u take 2929 hours for one video
An idea that occurred to me would be to make a house in ruins, or something like that, and in that house explain that there was another person before you in that world (It could be Steve or Alex) for me that would be great
I actually can’t wait for the snowy mountains, dark forests and mountains are by far my favourite biomes
3 days ago...
just found out about this , youutbe algorythm recommended the right thing this time <3 , I WANNA PLAY THIS WORLDDD
WOW
Imagine if there were mods added to make special weapons, and new cool bosses
you should make a dam in the mesa kinda like the hoover dam
colab with u/ShrimpySeagull??'
I'm sure you've heard this millions of times but this is amazing. First time seeing your content and I'm really happy I found you!
Wouldn't a more accurate name for the hotel be an 'inn'? Correct me if I'm wrong, and keep up the great work  I love the vids
Bro this looks siiiick! You should add a mandalorian reference in the biome somewhere like add the razor crest somewhere
LIKEEEE
I am definetily playing Minecraft after watching this video.
Hi, just a question- when will this be released so we can really play in it?
This is by far the best Minecraft build I have ever seen!
What if you added mini dungeons throughout the map akin to the shrines in breath of the wild. They could be found all over the map and could offer unique rewarda
in the mesa biom make a crane with traek
How would I import this into my Xbox or ps4
Pls in the nether have some sort of a statue of the fear all powerful wither
you should build an overused dirt road for carriages and for those who use that dont use the train. It also serves a funtion for the story since we cant really use the train as a means of transport
My favorite part was the railroad but you could add mine cart rails to the side of it so people can act like they’re on a train
Oh I just HOPE you create some kind of Viking like village for the snowy mountains, taking inspiration from Nordic culture
12:35 idk why but this reminds ne of tangled
amazing
This is not just a minecraft map ¡This is Art!
You should make a vanilla and a modded version, so if people want to have mods, you could implement buffalo into certain spots of the mesa biome or npcs and knights into kingdoms/villages.
sus
I think the snowy mountains architecture could be based on Russian architecture! It is colorful and beautiful!
Minecraft lost it's fun a long time ago as i'm getting older but i miss the times i spend playing for hours. This is everything i needed to salt minecraft a bit
Transform the ocean
This is amazing, but I feel like you should totally add a ranch near that one lonely train station. Horses and cattle were very important for the west!
I got an idea for the snow biom Norway or Viking themed Since they lived in snow bioms Kind of
Hey, how can I download this map on mobile bedrock edition? or is that not possible? I haven't been able to download it, and I've wanted to play it so much
16 million in a line? or 16 million total blocks
Hey I just want to say I love the WILD WEST era so I love this video
Make a viking village in the mountains/alps where the pray to the old nordic gods
His map look like fortnite chapter 3 map
this biom is amazing!!! the western theme is great! maybe you could add a indiana village into it aswell... love your content!
Pls add create mod it is cool
Marry Christmas for Australia
When you start on the snow biome can you give it a more Norse(Vikings) Touch?
I can just imagine someone making a Minecraft animated movie in this map.
Me still waiting for a lets play😐
Yee Haw!
Why you build a passenger train like there is no other town or connected to another biome
I’m really impressed
Can you upload it for bedrock
Story Idea: During the times of war, the Ultimate Survival World possessed two beings. These individuals could be responsible for the inevitable convergence that has been melded from the roots below. This world is almost trapped in time, consisting of ten biomes.  Among the snowy mountain, there had been a secret crystal that completely enveloped the grass lands prior. However, there was a reason for this. To stop the corruption of The End from spreading, The Queen of The Icy Mountain had to steal the knowledge from the dark oak forest's mansion, and take advantage from the wizards. Then, she had to envelop her nation into complete frost. She was the main reason why time had stopped and only two daylight cycles remained. This Island is the remnants of her actions. Though everyone hated her, she was the main reason why The Calamity hadn't started.  The Nether was so close to ordering the Onslaught, that deep underground, they almost destroyed the Roots of below. When The Queen of The Ice Nation vanished, she dispersed all her magical power through the world to keep it from dying. She wasn't a villain, rather a hero.
Looks incredible! One thing that really got me though was that you called it a toolsmith instead of a blacksmith though lol :))
Amazing as always. Cant wait for the next episode. :D
Hear me out...  What if for the mountains you could do a nepal theme because nepal is home of the largest mountain, mt. Everest you could add the Himalayen mountains and do a fun style like that. I hope you like my idea and I love what you have done so far with the world!!!
Now hide 900 Korok seeds across the map. 😂
This looks epic, and I am not sure if you have already said this in a previous video, but do all the different vanilla automatic farms (raid farm, villager farm, slime farm, etc.) work in this world?
I don't like how you over decorate things.
this thing is FREAKING crazy...  I can't wait to play it for myself
So like is this going to be available on console?
It’s insane how far Minecraft has come since I’ve played in 2011
I accidentally disliked your video because it said "can't like" and I was curious to see what would happen 😂 anyway I don't remember which of these videos it was but I liked all of them so hopefully that's enough. What I wanted to say with this is that I absolutely love your videos, you're so creative and I would never dislike! Keep up the amazing work.  Love and light Lu ❤️
You should build some graves, for those who died, during the construction of the bridge??
I think siberian monks would be a cool idea for the snowy mountains
The shot at 14:20 is absolutely marvelous. Shows the immense scale and detail in this map. Gorgeous.
Imagine deleting world!
An idea for the next place of worship like church mosque synagogue etc, I suggest a Buddhist temple or a Shintobudhist temple from japan, or maybe a Mongolian Tengri temple!  Loving the videos! keep up the good work, i love the amount of effort you and Steph put into this amazing map!
Bro that map is fortnite
If the rail path was real MC rail path
Bro what about the a there dimension
This is mental. But do you what would be really out of this world if you do the same but u add a lot of mods in it.
please my the bones on a YETI in the mountains.
This is beautiful. You're an amazing builder. And with that. You're also inspiring me for builds in my own survival world.  You're doing a great job.
too cool
Well, that is just amazing.
When do the map will release?
How are you so good at building
BRO THAT IS SO GOOD IT FELLED LIKE 1 SEC IT WAS SO INTERTANING (that was not me being mean btw)
You should make a bid yetis cave
I hope we get to play this
You should really put the create mod in you will be able to do working wind mill and moveable train
Can you build an Arabic style villages
I *CANNOT* wait for this world to be fully complete so I can go on it
The hardest part about building is telling yourself it looks good
Will you have to pay for the final version?
For this project, i infer that they literally have nasa pc's BECAUSE HOW CAN YOU RUN THIS 16M BLOCK WORLD WITH SHADERS ON!?!?!?
i hope all the players who gonna play this map be on adventure game mode
I honestly might just buy your patreon for this map alone
Dude can you make a the snowy mountains
oh damn you'll have to pay for this? sad, pretty cool world but it seems I won't play in it :(
The thing is I’m going to spend like four hours building a house and it’s going to look garbage compared to all of this
i'm sorry i didn't mean to dislike.
What is the seed?
Bro if i want to play this do i have to pay
wha is the texture pack used in the start of the video?
you can use dakshineswar kali temple and belur math ramakrishna temple 12th and 7th biggest hindu temples in the world so it is a great worship place for your map please think about that
Dude, this is awesome but I noticed something that the whole biome has only on town it also contains mining caves and more. It's my own thinking but you should add one more town a little further than the first town. You can also show that the town people uses the train to move good and people between the two towns. Than once again you did an awesome job
IT WOULD BE SUPER COOL IF YOU COULD ALSO DO A CUSTOM END CITY, AND STRONG HOLD. AND MAYBE USE A COMMAND OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WHICH MAKES IT SO THAT ALL STRONGHOLDS, AND END CITIES ARE CUSTOM.
Where’s the Indian reserve
SHUT UP  and take my sub 😎
Me when I play the map: mines all of the bridge “infinite wood”
1000000/10 nc building skills unbelievable
This reminds me of those minecraft tutorial worlds but upgraded 100 times more
Yes, I used to really want the train to run like the real thing
Revelation 21:4-7 "There will be no more death , or mourning , or crying , or pain. I am making everything new. Yes! I am coming soon.". . Revelation 16:15 ("Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!") . John 14:6  Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.....
YOU'RE CRAZY?!
please make a buddhist temple and/or buddhist statue! you can take inspo from the various regions of asia (south, southeast and east) for your builds ❤ i personally think thai temples look cool! and pagodas too
and for the great price of only 5 terrabytes
HEY
@TrixyBlox, How about using the custom NPC mod to create people?
rip laptop users
i wish it was free
Wow!
12:35 I didn‘t even realize this was the outside of the mines bruh
I didn't know how to best express how wonderful all the work you've done is so all I can really say is I love this I just love it
If you put this on the minecraft marketplace for bedrock I could do a letsplay on my youtube.
Can u download the World?
You should make a Hindu temple in snowy and mountainous region (for inspiration, you can see Kedarnath temple)
I think the Wild West Town is missing a Horse Stable
U can watch "Magnificent 7" for west life
can u make a bedrock map aswell please it will bring alot more players for more to enjoy
vikings in the ocean
8:45 I hope you continued the bridge into the water
So talented
For a religion. Maybe you could do Norse mythology!!
6:36 u should include a bell in the church
6:00 the water tower has to be much bigger and made out of metal
OHHHH I LOVE THE FIRST BIOME
I know im late but i would love to see a small cult style group hidden in one of the biomes
5:57 you are missing a bordelle
That is sick
I hope it's gonna be a map we can download to play into..
You should make one of the Winter biomes norse based
In the words of the great Joseph Joestar, HORY SHITTTT~!
5:14 since u have a Voodo doctor in the jungle already don‘t use one im Savannah.. maybe take inspiration from the Great Mosque of Djenné in Africa? That would be a really nice and big building.. and in addition maybe the wolf tribe was not part of the savannah population but rather built their own city with like African style rain dance traditions?
I would love for this to also be a mod so there will be npc’s and story quests
5:13 I think of white plank churches in America idk.. saw one in the old Columbus movie but I think that would have suited here too
Red dead 2
4:09 did they enslave the wolf tribe?
Idea: you could so something with wandering traders. Like dot some temporary camps around with trading options or something
Imagine putting the create mod in this map, then we could make a proper railroad and mining quarry when players settle in these areas on release. Creat has a massive steampunk like aesthetic, so it would suit the map perfectly in some areas like the Wild West biomes.
2:43 you should have put more colors for layering the spikes
You forgot to call it part 5
This my fav
You should've called the leather shop "Trapper" as it is more wild west theme.
Yoooo, this is so cool! All your devotion to this is thoroughly appreciated. I think you build an orthodox cathedral as a place of worship in one of the next biomes.
OMG That's amazing! AAAH!
You should do a barn for all the horses the people use
Man, the effort that went into those bridges on the train track is mind-boggling! Absolutely fantastic!
It would be fantastic play this map with a Vanilla plus modpack
I have some ideas if you could please add them so maybe add a volcano with a bastion like temple around or inside it up to you and floating island's with a city like 3 islands being connected with bridges forming a sky village with craters where the island originate and a pond which forms a waterfall at the side of an island that goes down to the world below and make a bridge connect to a cliff so the city can be accessable maybe you could do a story where something caused it to fly up in the sky and also maybe you could add an ice palace which rules over a snow village with frozen rivers and some igloos on the snow biomes idk you do you but please try to do this
I remember making a 32,000,000 block map on world painter, then I started making custom villages etc... Then I realised how big this map was, and I gave up
PLS Include Temple
nobody: absolutely no one:  11:13 - blocks in mesa: 💃💃💃
I always feel a huge burst of energy and excitement when you post a new video.
where lucky luck
Can you make something that is Indian themed for the savannah
pls add a temple because if your doing the savanna next so India is the best country which you set the country on that biome
which bioms except of the savanna aren`t finished? Ps: Your vids are good
pls join hermitcraft
I think some camps where Indians lived would be cool, even tho you said that we will see more of that in the Savannah it would still be cool if we saw the deserted camps that they left.
i really want to play this but i can't because i live in a country where we normally don't have visa or mastercard and our own creditcard does't count  guess i'll have to wait till i turn 18 or 21 to play this map
i think mine pc will lag out when in your survival minecarft
End neter
now post it on console in the bedrock Minecraft store for free
Can you use minecraft Language and letters :)
Can we see what you Bild? Whit your pov? (sorry for my English)
Could you do a vid after it’s done to show it all in detail for those who are broke 😂
You can add Indian civilization in taiga biome 😃
is the world download gonna be free? anybody knows
I fell very sorry for being not able to play this map.
Me very well knowing i dont have near enough space for this majestic map: _"haha... yeah... ill... download and play it when its over... yeahhh...."_
What a flex
I have an idea: Let underground caves inosculate under Nether portal but there must be a big underground dungeon.
We can do this
Bro you are creating one of legendary minecraft things that I will absolutely show to my Kids. Don't give up ! It's wonderful!
I wanna ask, if this maps is already finished. Do i have to use mods that you use when you make the maps?
ive heard of a minecraft mod called rails of war, using adequitly sized trains, if someone could update it to modern times and make a map wih it would be great
how about a mine in the wild west place
Railroad tracks are NOT functional… great
Motel not hotel better
Remind me of Red Dead Redemption
This reminds me of red dead redemption 2
9:32
Nice
Looks like the fortnite island lol
We need a mod for this map!
Other realms 😳😳
You should have a section of the map with a meteor crash site and just have a bunch of weird alien stuff growing out of it
Bro this is awesome, I wish I had the patience to do something like this
Is the map going to be for bedrock or java?
I think it would be cool to have a minecart track that players can repair to traverse the entire map nearing all the built up locations in one big circuit.
Can I play this on bedrock
Build a Orthodox Christian church in some village.
Make a railroad around the whole map, not just in the Wild West.
I really need to know if this is Pe edition or Pc edition or if its on both cause i only have Pe and need this
imagine mrbeast make a video of hide and seek of this map...it's gonna be litt man
Will you be upgrading nether and end too?
I played years of minecraft always building and im still very bad how trixy how u do this😂
merry christmas
This is insane
Where can I get his other minecraft maps
3:40 a leather building is called a tannery
Mata Nui but it's Minecraft
Definitely need some wanted posted for the towns
This is definitely gonna require a mod pack with special characters for the map.
The hype 🔥🔥🔥
can you do  on of the 6 of the Most Ancient Churches in Rome please
is there gonna be a way to play this world on bedrock?
NPC's would make this place feel alive
I mean all of the structures you’ve made are so nice you don’t even need to build your own house.
Hey I am very excited about this just one question where can I get this map when it's finished and is it for free?
a hindu temple would be cool
add a city hall
I was wondering if u would be doing anything asian inspired buildings or villages in this world?  maybe if u are doing a village that is asian inspired u can do himalayan/tibet village in the snowy mountains and have a giant buddhist temple in the mountain, or a east asian inspired northern city in the taiga with a temple dedicated to a multitude of Gods and Spirits and a palace for a cruel king/empereor that u will help rebel against and place his kind son on the throne
Something that would be cool if the spawn is on and deserted island (small) then there is a chest with a spyglass that you need to find the main land you need to look around then you just barely see the main island. And add a stable area in the western town for like a bunch of horses that some sells or something just an idea. 😁👍 Keep up the work loving the map.
Here’s a tip. Instead of calling the hotel a hotel, it would be best to call it an Inn. This is more historically accurate and fits the theme a bit better as hotel wasn’t a common word back then.
It always amazes me what you are able to build. I'd never be able to build things like that. Definitly worth 250 k likes,and even more. Please keep up the amazing work and stay healthy! And in addition. A wonderful christmas time and a Happy New Year! <3
Do a Hindu temple build. I never see them on Minecraft and as a Hindu it makes me feel sad. I hope you do it, do it in the snowy mountains to create a sacred river side temple (sorta like Kedarnath if you need inspiration)
For the savannah biome maybe u should make a sort of castle and a camp/village
You know I’m gonna spend all my time in the saloon at the town
Id love to play this but i dont think my pc is strong enaugth so im just gonna stick with the Movie
What if the server just got deleted 😂
Seriously tho, a shooting gallery inside or at the back of the weapons store to test out weapons before you buy them (like how it’s depicted in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly) would be AWESOME
What about the nether and end?
Pagan worship building/pagan town in the mountains or a forest!!
Awesome build but you forgot to add a stable for the horses in the town, a farm/ranch with sheep or pigs or horses to represent cattle, and a shooting gallery INSIDE the weapons store to test out weapons kind of like in the movie The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly
Hindu
bro this ain't minecraft it's fortnite lmfoa
Thats soo cool
This just screams red dead redemption
Wow
one day mojang will have to hire this guy
Im just asking are you maybe making avchiefments in your survival World.
3:18 we s
Looks very cool man👍🏻
This is one of my dreams I wish I could make in Minecraft takes for making it come true and those hours of hardwork well appreciated Merry Christmas and a happy New Year keep up the good work and stay safe <3
I wish u added a horse stable
Will you be able to play on bedrock xbox 1

Can't wait for downloading this and for my PC to become as hot as a star
Did i gonna share the map afther it done?
I think i need a super computer to play in this map because 2 render distance is not worth it for this map 😂😂
The jail in Wild West was in the sheriff building
I kinda think the church should be removed just an opinion
You forgot to build red Indian’s village
You have to add a end
If I compare you and grian you are better.
u make me feel about red ded edmption
Just imagine what he could do in Hytale
Wow
Pls keep this map free pls
Do an Nether/End mega upgrade
Make a abandoned village or a abandoned castle
Dont put creepers of you put the survival world is like hole place
anyone else agree a faction split 200-300 player server would be goddamn awesome with this map?
the world is epic but realy 90% wont be able to get this world
I cant wait until twe can play this
It is so awesome
Dec 24 padoru padoru day HASHIRE SORI YO KAZE NO YOU NI TSUKIMIHARA WO PADORU PADORU
My gripe with this project is that (and I'm probably just not the audience for this.) the world is too specific with its design and vision. When this is released, you're probably just going play it on the experience—it's questionable if you have any reason to play on it again once you conquered it (there probably is).  I question the longevity of the world beyond the first runthrough, or if you're using this in an SMP.  Populating the towns with villagers and assuming they can path around the complex builds may end up causing problems unless the pathing ai is tweaked.
id like to suggest that you should take a pagan spin on the taiga village. id love to see some more difference in religion.  i absolutely love this series, keep up. cant wait to see the finished results.
not sure if anyone knows what I mean but old ghost towns scare me so much. I don't think I could say why but of the few I've been to its hard to be there for more than a few hours. Theres something about the monotonous colors and plain open sky that's terrifying. I love the aesthetic at the same time though and I have to say driving though these types of places is really cool and exploring them is so fun but only for a little while.
This is my favourite so far!
This has gotta be my favourite video so far. Beautiful work man
Indian themed village
Imagine if they made Minecraft story mode with this map
can you get this on bedrock???
Will the finished map be on Patreon or will it be open to the public?
In the snowy biomes you should do a pagan based religion
Is this world for pocket edition
this world is so cool it's going so well.
ахуеть..
bro made fortnite in minecraft
You should stow ranged weapons in the wagons, it will help with the added realism of the west
The map looks from the sky a bit like the LEGO BIONICLE map.
I want to see mandir
Bro is literally turning it into an ark map. Incredible
Absolutely amazing dude.
I think a reef would be pretty cool
A paper plane but ina flying dino form and dino park and zoo
If you pair this with the zombie mod that forge lab used it would be epic
I hope that in the town the undertaker have his shop decorated with some coffins
Great work on this however this comment is just here to increase the height of the video
why is there an amogus in the thumbnail
The railway Is giving me back to the future vibes
I see your master plan.....You're trying to teach us about history while pretending like its mostly about minecraft.
Im just hoping theres a BTTF reference
You should add some Easter Eggs & Secrets to the World, Delorean In Cave, Clock Tower Being Under Construction From BTTF3 In Wild West, Ect.
Plessy  make something  related to india and Hinduism
I would love to buy this map but I have no idea how to download or even play pre made maps can anyone help me out?
Can’t wait!
We need TrixyBlox x Mumbo Jumbo
Add oil rigs!!!!
Idea for Savannah biome : You can add a huge mountain in the biome like in the lion King or more realistically the mountain in Kenya on which the country's name was based on Mt. Kirinyaga it might be a good addition to the lore of this biome...
Is it going to be in Java or bedrock
It's beautiful
How to destroy ur pc download this map and use the most realistic texture pack ahhahaah
For the mountains, how about making someting like The Ellora Caves as the place of worship
Please do snowy mountains
hey man - this is super cool! everything that you’re putting into this is full of passion for what you do, and it shows, can’t wait to download the final version 😎
Modded mobs?
Love the map and all but, can you have a download of the map without the "upgraded everything" at this point the map looks like a adventure map.
*with your friends* guess Im not playing this map then 😭
Can you please change the ‘hotel’ banners to say ‘inn’ . It is much more western.
i would add an underworld dungeon (one of those insanely huge ones) to this biome. not hating on this work, its beautiful. but the canyon with the gold stuff thing feels not too Trixy, couldn't have said it better.
I am amazed and I wish its compatible with tlauncher
for the snowy mountains you should do tibetan/nepalese influenced culture! and Buddhism!
Yo hear me out ransacked train from a while ago at the bottom of one of the canyons and debris of a past bridge that was blown up
man i dont want to be spoiled when i play it but i also want you to have views because this is insane
We need to like I can’t wait for it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What about end and nether bro
Would have been cool if you added a tank engine or shunter
Because it’s a custom world can you still go mining for ores just like a normal world ?
Very, very well done. Outstanding. Happy Holidays to you and Steph!
Me: downloads the map My phone and pc: why must you hurt me that way
For the tundra biome the homes should be made out of ice and built into caves for less resources cost
TBH id love if we have a rideable rail on the tracks as well
Can't wait to play this map
Amazing, great job bro
I would love to see an Eastern Orthodox Church for the tundra village, when I think of a tundra I think of Russia.
I would love to see a abandoned village in maybe the taiga or mountains. That would make it feel a bit more realistic. And maybe bring a bit more story.
You play red dead redemption for more inspiration for the west
Is this gonna be bedrock compatible
Please try an Asian or an indian culture typed biome or a village once
Next place to worship  please temple
So hyped for this project and he you’ve put so much effort into this and it’s still going to be worth it
what about a japanese style shrine?
I love your videos so much.
I would have added a ferryboat in the river as it's very western theme... and I would have added a small native American indian camp as an Easter egg or poi👍🏻😁
Bro minecraft needs to hire you
Looks amazing! a faction server on this would be great
indian temple in the next one pls
So Talented bro!
NOOOOOO you forgot to add the BUTTER BARN :(
i glimpsed at the thumbnail and thought it was a fortnite map
When you do the snowy mountains you should make the town inside the mountain.You could take inspiration from the elf build, but more like a Norse society.You could make a building where they take ice and snow and turn it into water for a farm.They have a bunch of leather armor, as that’s all that will warm them up.It can be attached to an underground port with Viking ships (this probably won’t get in, but still.)They won’t have very much metal as mountains don’t usually have much metal, so they will mainly have wooden and stone tools and houses.They will have an armory that doubles as a training center, as they are based off of Vikings.They will have a tree farm and stone mine to continue to build and replenish lost weapons (mainly axes.)They will naturally have a farm, as they have slim pickings in snowy mountains.They farm cows for leather and pork chop, horse for raiding and upon death more leather, and wheat for the cows and horses and the leftovers can be used for bread.They would need an enchanting room, as they only have leather and stone or wood tools.They might even have a mob grinder for potions to further increase they fighting style( this could model after berserker’s.)I’m not sure what kind of church it would be, but it at the center you could put a trident with channeling and loyalty three to simulate mjolnir and gungir combined (and even something similar to that with the sea temple.)You could put banner at the entrance to help keep in heat.You could put in a cooking room that doubles as a smelting room, because they would do so little with pipes going all over the place to transport heat.A library would be a nice place to enhance life, as they have been all over with stories about the other biomes.It would be easy to show how they disappeared.They could have been attacked by other civilizations, or got a plague or disease from them (they could have even gotten the curse from the jungle.)This forced them to leave after many died, with the remaining dying from the cold due to lack of supplies.I really hope you use this idea, but if you do you’ll probably have to cut a few things.
I love how videos like this always have the mobs go  *HELICOPTER HELICOPTER*
Let's just appreciate how many times he spend for this content.
I need to find someway to learn how to do stuff like this
You never cease to amaze me, Trixy! Wishing you a happy holiday season mate.
Honestly kind of surprised he didn’t do anything with Native Americans like a small Navajo inspired village would’ve been really cool to see because honestly I feel like Wild West trope of just cowboys and gold mines is over used
Nice
I wish I could do this with my friends but they all bedrock and its basically impossible to get good mods and maps on bedrock
My boy just inspired a build in club penguin and I think It's amazing
Will this be available for bedrock edition?
where are the indigenous peoples of the Americas
Yoooo ur back
For the other biomes,make a collab with other master builders like you,it be awesome
Blown away yet again!
Here’s a good idea, put an icy cave in one of the mountains and put a fossil stuck in the ice! That would be super cool!
With the whole caves and cliffs update, i feel like it would be really fitting to have an awesome underground area filled with gems, dungeons, ancient artifacts and fossils, and stuff like that but at the same time that would be a lot of work
Is it just me or is trixys face fake
Cool
Hope this isn’t too much, but what about making one more town? Since the passengers could have like somewhere else to go.
This is insane!!!
You need to have a shattered savanna (emojis so this is stand out)😋😋☹️😔😚😔🧐🥸😋😋🥺😍😩😚😚😟😞😛😔😚😟😚😭😛😋😒🤨😞😖🥺😭🤯😔😔😣🥺☹️😋🥸☹️😡🤓😎😡😎🧐😠🤩😠😡🥺😊😠😊😠😣😒🤩😊😚💩💩😠😠🥺😊🤩😊😚😋😚😈😎😣😔🤩😡😡😚😇😎😥☹️😥☹️😶‍🌫️🥶😣😥☹️🤗☹️😱☹️😰😣😣😰🤗😱☹️🏳️‍⚧️🇧🇧🏳️‍⚧️🇧🇭🏳️‍⚧️🇦🇹🏳️‍⚧️🇦🇹🏳️‍⚧️🇦🇺🏳️‍⚧️🇦🇹🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🇦🇹🇦🇺
awesome job dude this is so cool.
Does anyone know if we are able to do this on Nintendo
Yo the Wild West town reminds me of red dead redemption 2, it’s a really good game!
Not that it matters but the sheriff office would be inside the jail
YEAH NEXT EPISODE IS RELEASED
The ULTIMATE Survival World! this world is crazy but imagine if someone mixed this map with the concept of civilazation presented in this vid "200 Players Build A MASSIVE Civilization in Minecraft" I just feel like that would be absolutly wild.
Add a red dead redemption Easter egg also I see Luke’s notable doing 1000 days on this
I have an idea to add an inspired build called the Masjid or a place of worship for Muslims in the Taiga Biome
I bet this world can have different kinds of animals in those environmental areas.
i cant for this map to release. im so hyped for it! this the second time ive watched these videos, and it gives me so much inspiration to push myself further in my builds.
The Mesa is my favorite biome so far, it looks so good and I’m looking forward to the next
This shit is insane
I think the one thing that's bugging me here is the higher up stacks.  First, there's too many of them, I feel.  Part of what makes Monument Valley impressive is that it's a huge wide flat open plain with just a couple of buttes thrusting up from it- their rarity, the way they break up the otherwise flat landscape, is part of their beauty (or buttey).  Secondly, they don't continue the layering of the mesa biome, instead appearing to be a single material.
three words ... holy shit wow!
Pls make a snow village&more
This will be available for free?   For Everyone?
He says this has taken him hundreds of hours, imagine how long it would take without world edit
Ok, this is cool, but not just minecraft-youtubers are worth checking out.  Sci Man Dan, Hbomberguy, Oversimplified,  Tier Zoo, theres Something for each Taste, duh.
cant imagine how large is this world and how long does it take to building terrains
OH
I’m gonna be sad when this series is over
The thumbnail is sus.
Sad u cant use the railroad
You spend all of your time making such a masterpiece in a brick game and that’s just amazing. Remind me how many hours you’ve spent already building this dream survival world?
This is utterly insane-
Bro so nice work we are waiting to play this map 👍👍🤞
In what version of Minecraft will be this map at the end?
And sub
You make the best stuff I give a like
for the train to go under one of the amount of rocks in the canyon would be great
Will you be able to get this on bedrock
i wish this is free
GOAT
GOAT
GOAT
love this series and can't wait to play this map. completely worth the wait. rush NOTHING!!!
Pls make a synagogue in one of the biomes. :)
Insane,hopefully someone will port it to bedrock.
Can it be played in a phone of tablet or xbox or anything else
🤩
It would be really cool if some of the snowy mountains are so high to where you could barely see the bottom with and ice cave at the top or something
As a Pagan, maybe some kind of ritual site (Like stone henge or totemic shrines) or even a Nordic style churcgh for one of the places of worship would be cool. It would likely fit best in a colder biome.
So how would we download this world?
how about you add some sports or Olympics of some kind somewhere
Definitely the best build yet in my opinion. Can't wait for the full release man keep up the good work
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH THIS IS BLOODY AMAZING
can you try to add a science base or a modern house in the mountains its just an idea
That has to be the most perfect soundtrack for that biome well done seriously
Well I can't wait to play it!
YES ITS BACK. GOOD JOB
Is there a way you can program the villagers trades? It'd be a cool story element to have to go mining to get gold so thatt you could purchase cool enchanted loot
I'd like to see a part of the world based on old Buddhist architecture and culture, I think it would be neat to have that represented
it doesnt even look like minecraft anymore 😂
Mind if i use your village for inspiration?
Bro This looks so good and when will this open up
You should build a deep dark city under the mountain and it should have a snake statue with sculk pouring from its mouth and a vault to keep "something" out!!!
It would be awesome, well once you finish the map there can be a multiplayer RP server with different clans, for all the different biomes. But also have lots of events that happens all around the map.
*When the world needed him the most, he most certainly came back.*
honestly i havent been keeping up with this series. i wanna be surprised when it finally comes out! i still like every time though, keep it up please :)
You should make a custom nether, end, stronghold, bastion, netherfortress and end city it would be epic
Trixy: Building away  Me: WHERES THE CLERIC
Hey Trixy fantastic work on the USW can't wait to see the world once it's released, you have a creative mindset. All I could think of to add in your USW would be time-travelers from the future to find someone or something. To avoid future Annihilation from happening and may create a quest to find and destroy the future villains.  Thanks  Aidan
Random Idea: there could be a wizard tower like a peak in the snowy mountains
The snowy mountains should have a castle and some knights along with cool lore
You should maybe include command blocks which do not let a player go to certain areas before "unlocking" them. It would add a LOT to the story
Where is end portal
I wish this can be bedrock
The Wild Side of the US
4-4-0 Locomotives had the headlight on the top of the boiler with the bell in the middle, that is unless your using the Erie Railroad 4-4-0s as a model. Great model though.
In the last part you should add frozen skeletons and hidden camps in the mountains
Hes finished…
cant wait to play looks pog yee haw
Please make this a thing on bedrock
This is what I’ve always dreamed of making in Minecraft, but I never had the time, so thanks for making my dreams come true.
what shader did you use
question. was the town and outlaw town, if so, why is there a jail and sheriffs office? it looks really good though. keep it up!
Wow I haven't seen this channel for 8 months I didn't know that you reached 2 ml subscribers great work man
You should make a ski town in the snowy peaks!
Have some nether stuff if they ever relight the portal
Wow
ur gonna change the world
Just one word to describe this world: A M A Z I N G
It will be pretty cool if there was an entire group of people that role played this To make it a story
Listen man, I would try to play but my minecraft would explode and work at 1 fps.
Sucks that you can't ride the train
Yooo I can't wait to use mods on this awesome map too.
Man, I really hope you used Red Dead Redemption as a source of inspiration for your Wild West Town, it’s such a great and unique interpretation of the Wild West that remains faithful to the details!
for the snow you should make a snow castle or a floating island
I hope they use Mods to get it so the train actually moves would be fun to Ride on
you should turn the map into a server
How do you make the stone wall connect to the air
I think it’d be funny if there was a Scientology building in one of the villages
Yeah I sadly don’t have the money for this… Eventually I will
do a dragon statio
I'd recommend add some NPCs on the map!
Plsssss make copy bedrock edition
Man your the best
An idea for either the Taiga or Mountain biome would be to have it be Norse/Viking themed, maybe some hints at Ice Giants hidden in places.  For a place of worship obviously it would be based off the Norse Gods/Aesir.
dude, you just blow me away.  I love how you really do some research to try and get a good idea how it should look
Ah yes, the mesa, Red Dead Redemption 3
The snowy mountain biome should deferit have a yeati or somin
Just goes to show how lazy the minecraft developers are
Great video. You should add a steamboat port at the city, and a steamboat that connects it to the mining area since there’s already a dock
Misty mountain  Edit:from the hobit
Are you also gonna do the nether?
Fantastic Work! My Friend!
Dude I get so hype whenever I see these in my feed
LETS GOOOO.
only 69K likes to go let's do this
How do i download?
please release the map
I would like for the snow biome to have a Russian type style along with that one colorful building in Moscow (forgot the name)
A question, the map will be available for console??
You are amazing, And so is the world your making!
WIZARD TOWER?
I think the savanna biome should have a mosque since that's the most realistic.
I can’t wait to see the snowy mountains part of the map And the nether 😱that will be sick
You could make video game worlds and levels. You are a legend.
Is this a mod? I want to play it but I can’t afford a pc and can’t figure out how to mod Minecraft on a Mac.
Can you please do a stave church or something  viking ritual grounds for the snow biome?🙏🏻
Nether?
Maybe you could add a ruined train
I love this series sooo much ❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰
Man I really wish you’d join season 9 of hermitcraft. Survival might be a fun change of pace and a new challenge for yourself
If you See this wide you do for the same map a nether and end Version of this?
I hope you make this available on bedrock
Could you please do “Cristo redentor”? If you don’t know that’s Rio de Janeiro’s statue. Ps: I’m brasilian and Brasil is not just Rio de Janeiro!!!
I have 1 question? Does the train work or its just a design?
I've been waiting for long finally😌
Me after watching the vid : time to build mine-  Hours later    Me : ima just continue playing roblox
How do we play it
how many hours did you do it all
Will the map be the block-breaking sort of survival, or will it be more adventure mode-ish?  either way, VERY cool
what are you gonna do when The warden comes out
We want a gurduwara punjabi and indian theme
It would be cool if the jail was Gaol like with older jails
you can tell this guy is used to just screen recording cause he can’t color grade his talking head shot for shit
i think the maisa worshiping area should be like a pit of fire were they sacrifice somebody to live in peace from a demon mutant THE WITHER!!!!!!
Oh, finally, minecraft dead redemption
This reminds me of red dead redemption soooooo much
great video great work!
I don’t know if you’re gonna be seeing this message but I want you making a abandon building in your next video please thank you
you truly go above and beyond with every single one of these builds. its a delight to watch, and im sure it will be a delight to play! thank you
This has to be my absolute favorite transformed biome. Everything is just perfect and full of life!
first of all this whole series is amazing and i commend your talent!!! second of all,,,,  MORE CACTI PLS
I am new to Minecraft and holy shit this guy has insane builds
If someone doesn’t make a 100 days ok this I swear
kinda looks like a fortnite map...
Suas construções são simplesmente incríveis, LIKE no começo do vídeo!
Make sure to color grade your face cam shots!
I am a train nerd, idk I just wanted to say that
For the snowy mountains u should do an ancient temple of monks that lives high in the mountains and worships their gods.
in the nether, how about you add a village that is a kingdom, with there being a tower in the middle housing  sceletons from people imprisoned in the past.
Maybe you could add a monk like island out of view
0.0% chance of puss.... but then again neither do I 🤫
put in one of the 2 snow biomes with north mytologi
Oh my god, you out did yourself this time. That was one of the most coolest builds and felt oddly nostalgic to me. I cannot wait to play it with my friend.   As someone who used to build always in Minecraft, I have nothing but respect for you. It is so tedious and to build that scale is absolutely incredible.   Only suggestion I have is for the "mountains" sticking up. It would be way cooler to add the normal colors of the mesa to them and make them a little bigger (not taller). That way it has more of the canyon feel.  Also huge rope bridges between tiny sticking out Mesa mountains would look really cool.  For the snowy mountains biome, I recommend adding rope bridges as well. That way it looks like people have been traversing the mountains.
Hear me out, u should adds big ranch/ farm somewhere in the mesa that would be fitting.
Your lore, incredible building skills and imagination keep me coming back for more. I have never seen another YouTuber with more passion and creativity than you and Steph
It makes me sad that we will be forced to buy your patreon subscription just to play this amazing looking world.
It's going to be for mc pe too?
Wouldn’t it be cool if there was like a mini Japanese village in like the plains or ice biome
Sleusing is a real thing although its usually stand alone machines
It's funny that the fact that most of the player's that play on this map would probably just destroy the buildings just for the resources
My favorite one yet.
new weapons ?
Everyone’s pc is going to turn into a Boeing 747 playing this world 😂
Will the world be free to download once it’s done? I don’t have any money  or a card to buy on his Patron.
its ok ig. It breaks the whole simplicity of minecraft though so it feels awful to play on
Idea:  Steampunk airship  It seems kinda far out but I think it would be cool for the outlaws to have been able to harvest some ancient scripts and been able to mesh steam power and some form of ancient energy to lift the balloon off the ground. Would definitely be cool to see
how will it work on console like ps4
When you make the tundra it would be very cool to add many icy caves and a ice castle with cool stuff and mabye even something like a frozen flame
I cant wait for the tundra remake I can already seeing my self with a snow golem army with it
I wanna see Ltn 100 days on this
Mr blox, does each biome have only one main village? Or are there smaller regular villages dotted around?
How many hours did this biome take?
I am really amazed and keep up the amazing work 👍🏼👍🏼
HYPE TRAIN ?
Should’ve done a little graveyard in the town
Let's get to 250k likes asap
lindo
I thought 16 million was a lot but i forgot the real survival world passes that.
Worth waiting for 2 month s
Idea for snowy mountains, a yeti's cave, also there could be a yeto terrorizing the mountain settlers. There would be another destroyed town on a different mountain that the settlers didnt notice.
can you make sure the barells have loot in them?
Add some mods for npcs, moving trains, and movable objects but other than that it looks really good
Bro needs to add custom weapons
the guy looks like Jack Harlow when he was ugly
Like
Is the world also on mobile cus I’m broke
A brick jail would have been more realistic
Are you implementing 1.18 features?
Only thing I’d add is maybe a horse stable and a bank to rob
ITS THE CHAPTER 4 ISLAND GUYS, OMG!!!!!
You should at some spilts to support it
@TrixyBlox so we have to pay to play?
Bro it felt like a year waiting for this video 😂 glad it’s here tho
Keep up the awesome work. For a suggestion what about you make a Norse style town for the snowy tundra
Just a small idea when your done with the world you should make a mod pack or have some one make a mod pack for you to accompany this amazing world.
Wish I have minecraft
Oh my god you could totally turn this map into a Minecraft server and host so many people and factions woah
for merch make a trixy blox sticker
Can you build an Isolated little island with a jungle on it?
Can you do something Finnish related thing in the ice biome
My boy
Would this be available for bedrock addition too?
"Nothing can more impressive then Joel building that humongous castle in survival mode in Empires" -Me being my stupid self before watching this video  "Hold up- Wait a got damn minute- He's making a minecraft world...with all the biomes...REMAKING said biomes...With custom villages....INTERIOR DESIGN....WITH LORE....*ALL BY HIMSELF?!??!?*"  -Me, after rewatching all the videos because I forgot what he was doing and then realizing that he deserves an Oscar.
Is this going to be in both versions
If snowy mountains are going to get village, it would be pretty cool to see Nepal-ish or Bhutan-ish monastery there!
maybe forge labs could do a hundred day hardcore survival on this island
You givin grian a run for his money
Is this world going to be available on bedrock
Ngl low key the TB merch reminded me of teberculosis
Get this guy a reward now
What about a town with no place of worship like and atheist town with a lab or observatory
Will u make stuff for cave biomes to? i think that would look so cool
The entire time he was building the track is was thinking how nobody would ever go out of there way to make that many bridges and often tracks ran with the country rather then push through it. Then he zoomed out and I was just like "ok that's cool"
Hi
Soo!! Many inspiration!! :0
This might be nitpicking, but the stalagmites and stalagtites wouldnt form in a mineshaft for what, thousands of years? Could go lighter on them. This looks absolutely incredible though. I love the signs on the buildings.
Are you joining hermitcraft season 9?
Why do I bother waking up and turning on MInecraft? No words can describe your talent.
I've never seen dedication like this before. Well done bro. Well done
I think what I love the most about this episode is definitely the terraforming done for the Mesa biome & the whole railway system
This gonna be laggy
Honestly, this is the first time I'll be making a base in a Mesa biome. Good work my man
The problem is that my potato pc would explode as soon as I touch the floor
For the savannah biome, instead of a church worshipping around a GIANT baobab tree could be cool, or maybe even the bones of a ginormous ancient rhinoceros ? So excited to see what you come up with!
you should add some type of withering forest cause all that wood has to come from somewhere and i think it would look really cool
You should add frozen villagers in the mountains
I have an idea for a mountain building: a traditional Japanese/Chinese style village I don't know if you've already done the mountainous environment, but I'd like to see something like that.
Common Guys 250k
The village makes me remember of Kakarico village in "Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess". Damn, nostalgia is striking again
Just gonna post it again just in case but I wanna see the tundra biomes worship be a pagan ritual circle
I think the tundra should be inspired by skyrim
Can you do the water monuments and coral reefs?
Hey TrixyBlox, what are your pc specs?
will thisw world be available on bedrock  just wanted to know
For the mountains u should base it off of buhdism
this man DESERVES  a job at mojang
Wow...   :O
Epic work
Will you add this on the creator marketplace on Bedrock Edition, so all of us can experience this?! Also love what all the progress, maybe you should do a Q&A/Comment Response Video, since there seems to be a lot of questions and suggestions from the community! Keep up the great work!! :)
I think it would be cool if the snowy mountains had a secret cave to explore
3MIL days in hardcore minecraft be like
Man, I wish there were actual cranes in mc.
Make a download link pls
This looks cool! *subs*. “You will be able to download it via my patreon”. *unsubs*
WE NEED MORE LIKES!!!!!!!11111111
Its to long to a wait you
Says a relatively small scale yet has a 16000000 block world and built a thicccccccccccccccccccc temple
Wow I had no idea the water towers were for water
Add  a ufo crash to a savana deserts are also well known for things like area51 and crop circles
Go listen to my new practice session 3 🙏  https://youtu.be/UFRm_eou3qY
Idea for the town: A stable, since I find horses are a staple in a Wild West setting.
Amazing work!
So.. Just going to ask, who else had Red Dead redemption vibes?
Shouldn't you give the plains more terrains? Players wouldn't want to build their homes on flat fields.
You are really one hell of a builder.
The fact that I'm not gonna be able to play this Map hurts  I have money to pay but no way to  I don't have a bank account or money in PayPal  Shit
What will happen for caves?
I, an avid lover of all things western in movie or series format, am very impressed with your interpretations!
bruh made a fortnite map
Imagine just going in creative and then just finding out the little details that you wouldn’t find in survival.
hello i make a lets play in Minecraft lets chek if you want (i am french so = its marrant) thank you :)
If I were to play this map, I would build a house for myself in each biome for whenever I travel through it. Also think you could make an ultimate deep dark biome when the caves and cliffs update comes?
I clicked it because the map looked like amogus         Please help is everywhere i cant scape hel
The village need more houses
Yasss!
This is by far my favourite biome yet. The town has such an amazing vibe and feels right out of a movie, and the canyon is stunning and dripping with atmosphere, the sheer sense of scale is incredible. I'm in awe.
trixyblox when you tackle the mountains please add a secret base with a piston door roof entrance, I think it would be cool
You desurve (sorry for bad english) to call this map the ultimate survival world
The problem with this whole world is that no one will want to break any blocks when they play because it all looks soooo gooood :)
Please do in the mountains Norse gods as religion
Someone make a mod for this dude
Do secreat sunken UFO in the Ocean
Chin-Yi University Professor: Everyone Needs to Take a Stand  Assistant Professor Hsie You-yuan Assistant Professor Hsie You-yuan of Chin-Yi University of Technology said, “Live organ harvesting is very inhuman. People in China live under the CCP’s control and have no human rights.”  He said practicing Falun Dafa benefits people's minds and bodies and was very popular in China, but the CCP fears any organization or group it doesn’t control and uses various excuses to persecute them.  He said live organ harvesting is state-level murder: “Everyone needs to take a stand and spread this information to more people so more people will stand up.”
The wild west really reminds me of dbds dead dawg saloon map!
How much is the world going to be
I have some stronghold recommendations, if you haven’t done them yet. Maybe you can make a hidden tunnel to the stronghold from the surface, in some snowy mountains in the tundra, hiding something from the rest of the world. Edit: feel free to improvise on the idea, it’s kinda half baked
wow
is this java or regular minecraft
hey man I'm making my own giant world that is fantasy-medieval styled
stave church!!!!!!
Ayyy the legend is back
Can this work on bedrock edition?
This just might be my favorite biome you've done so far. It's GORGEOUS.
Imagine if those trains moved..
poggerschamp mate
you're like the khaios of minecraft lmao.
Amazing Work
Someone should make a mod pack for this world just to enhance it
Its so amazing what 2 people and really much time can make. Highly Props to you guys. Its really mindblowing how minecraft can be so pretty! Really appreciate that you are redesignin Minecraft. Its like a new game. Wow ❤️
Still so cool
You are such a talented individual
Like the vid we need this world !
slabspam and messy texturing, it just makes it harder for your eyes to focus on anything, other than that it looks pretty pog. i suggest cleaning stuff up, especially paths since theyre important for gameplay
unreal
So. How do you get on this legendary map i wanna ride throught canyons
foe the snowy mountain, i would make celeste references! lol 🏔️🏔️
Swear I've seen this dude on tiktok or am I tripping?
Can you make roads connecting the towns and regions so I can go on my horse from the snowy mountains down to the mesa town. Also will there be the same amount of ores in the mesa as normal?
LOVE IT!!! This Series is Awesome, I can't wait to see it finished!!
Is there a server download, I want to build a beautiful canon in the winter region.
Ocean builds would be cool as well as little archipelagos
Will it be available for console players
You are creazy
Will there be caves? Maybe u can make the caves like ark aberration 😁
12:18 "If only mining was this fun is Runescape"*
For real, why hasn't he joined hermitcrafted yet
you should add islands
Will there be ice caves in the mountains with maybe some kind of prison and a book in a chest which sais abo7t the last berson who was there but sadly died
Super cool
As a worship place ad  a Greek temple
Mhhh. How about some haunted desert ruins of a desert village? A war happened there and the lost souls of the dead couldnt rest, so they re-entered their corpses and wander around in eternity, attacking and feasting on anyone who may enter those ruins.
yah i bet you anything your gonna make a fortune as soon as this comes out.
Keep it up guys! this is a major project and will be cherished for years!~
You worked really hard on this
i wont think this world much as a basic survival world because you wouldnt want to ruin it like dig up all the gold in the mesa i think of it more as a roleplay world instead of a basic survival world
You should build a buddhist temple for the ice biome, y'know since buddhist is more popular on tibet and tibet is cold and located in a high altitude
Yay!!!
Wow imagine the amount of work he puts in this!YOU ARE AWESOME MAN
just title them genuinely
I'm really hoping that the loot isn't just good, but custom loot with special names and lore tags.
You should make specific heads that act like relics to try and find and collect on the map. Similar to the wool monuments back in the day which will add a way to encourage exploration and tickle people’s collector bone.
I hope this will be available for both Java and Bedrock, my younger brother would love that
How long did this take
for the taige pls make it like an artic expedition like village
Are u gonna do the end/nether ?
Hey TrixyBlox. Idk if you Will see this comment, but i thought it would be really cool to have a mountain going Up to build limit. A Minecraft Mount Everest
I would love to see The type of fake wild West villages with The "buildings" being just a front of The house
the ultimate survival world, created my the ultimate minecraft builder.
Eat your cereal
You should make dam and a town
Will this be on bedrock
absolute trooper this man is
So you gotta pay $ to download map? Or is it free? You did an amazing job with the map btw, im really impressed👏💜
Is the USW going to be mod friendly with certain mods? I buddy of mine and I wanted to add on some temperature, more extreme hunger/thirst mods, and a minor few others so that we have to really take our time to explore everything. Especially the hotter and colder areas due to the weather and conditions.
is the map download gonna be free? and if not will you do a giveaway of the map download for those who cant afford it.
Have you done the Swamp Biome yet?
You should make a gulag for the snow biome
Z
You should really add some japanese/chinese temples in the snowy mountains, and f its you, it’ll probably be awsome!
Return of the king
Great video, the clips of you irl though are always so underexposed.
This feels Like breath of the wild without the powers, and fallout without the nuclear aftermath!
Will you be able to get it on bedrock ????…??
All I could think about was Arthur Morgan
I feel that there is not much more that I can say other than this is why I love minecraft. People like you. I just found this series and am now heading over to support you. From the idea to the exucation  and everything else its amazing. Maybe next time make a Japanese style part? That could be a great creative outlet cause of all the stunning buildings
If you had the create mod in this you could actually make the train go around
woooooooooooo
I would love to support your Patreon unfortunately I can't.
Looks like chapter 3 fortnite map
Such mind-boggling dedication.
I am so excited when the map finished. Every thing on this map looks soooooooo amazing.
14:01 this one was soo lit ❤️
5.2k to comment
Im gonna blow up one of the train bridges, so it looks like robbers are gonna steal the gold from it.
I think for the snowy biome maybe you should add in a frozen copper vault that houses the villager curing laboratory found in the igloos floor.
These structures would go great in a structure mod!
Red dead redemption
If its done can it download for bedrock android?
Epic <3
Can you imagine a hunger games on this map!!?
The music in this video has heavy Far cry new dawn vibes
Just wanted to say, you started this before I had a pc, glad I will be able to play it some time.
Could we have the world download?
i cant believe how many hours u build this Good Job!
When do you think this whole map will be out to the public and all finished?
How can you plan on this map to explore
Some YouTubers may not work hard at all for their subscribers, but on the other hand we have TrixyBlox a Minecraft YouTuber who has spent a whole entire year creating a new Minecraft map with a whole entire storyline to go with it just for others to enjoy.
Is this going to be on console too
You should add a secret sky village that's extremely advance and has a lot of technology. Looking at it from the main world you'd only see a giant cloud.
For the frost biome the religion you should do there is a Nordic religion I just feel like that fits the frost biome pretty well
Is that an rdr2 reference ⁉️
You should make a mod for this or hire someone to do this, I think it would be super cool
13:34 SPOT THE “UM”
Will it be cool if you add a abonded dragon castle to one of the bioms 😳
honestly so excited for this... definitely dropping a few dollars to get it
I love how we also get little fun history facts as well!
the savanna should have a african look, so it feels more real and makes sense.....
Nice
SO GOOD
YES
Very good job👍
This is an amazing world. Do you have to be a patron member or pay anything to play it?
just looks like Fortnite with every season mashed into a Minecraft world (thumbnail)
Sorry to say this, but the train’s too big. You can find some good tutorials on properly sized trains from CraftyFoxe and other channels
Make a cave of ice in snow mountan
I will prob be in the mesa when I play this bc it’s my favorite biome on your map, I’m excited for the final result and merry Christmas bro.
Dude can you make a tutorial or a separate world for that train? I really need it in my world
Do the next vid as soon as possible 🥱😡
It wasn't survival tho
These are some of the most beautiful builds I've ever seen. I can't wait to play this!
Such amazing work. It is so amazing.
That's just reminds me of the daltons  Great job man  You really put a lot of work and efforts it just continue like that this is amazing
Please continue
The village was amazing but to me it's missing a stables
I think the rocky terrain could have used a bit more work involving the color aspects because the rock layers being different in the structure of the rocks, but I love how the towns look with the big bulky houses still giving off a cluttered theme.
This dude needs some SERIOUSE recognition! he puts an insane amount of effort that has a long time player of minecraft i have a  massive respect for. these builds take a lot of time, and the builds themselves are SO worth the wait. every one of these biome videos have displayed exactly how good Trixy really is... and hes one of the best builders ive seen!  The Savanah looks spectacular and i cant wait to see what comes next! (but remember to feed yourself trixy XD)
A gang of outlaws who moved to open and free lands? Sounds familiar… very “Dutch”…
what you build is just.. mindblowing
By far my favorite biome yet can’t wait for the download I’m definitely going to become a patron for this world you can just tell how much work you’ve put into this
Maybe an Asian inspired village in the snow mountains, kinda like in ‘Avatar : the last air bender’ ! The air bending town to be exact (^_-)
I’ve been checking the channel for days waiting for the new episode
Are you going to upgrade the nether and end
Wow this is incredible thank you for your dedication and thx to Steph too!!!! 😁
i’m so hyped for this to be fine
I love this
Club Penguin!
wow
No, im pretty sure thats the fortnite map (JOKE)
Could you please do a series of you showcasing the world for people who can't access it?
He forgot to build a stable like dude the western people used horses
You will inspire millions with this.
Here’s something for the map in the west there was dubble track mainlines also I would recommend ether shortening the locomotive or making the drive wheels larger to make it more proportional to a real American type steam locomotive such as the general or Texas
in the snowy mountains a Japanese style village many be a good idea
why does he have no eyelashes on his right eye
I can’t download it 😭😭
End would be great to see transformed. Maybe even an ender village in that barren land. Would be so cool to see what you come up with.
Can’t wait for the nether part
This looks absolutely amazing, I do think you were a bit too liberal with the bridges, but I have never seen a more beautiful Mesa biome
Wish so much that I could play it but I can’t 😭😭😭
By far my favorite from all the ones you’ve done. They are all awesome but the Wild West theme is unbeatable
You can include buddahs tombs in savanas
i am overflowing with inspiration!! I think this should be a genuine goal for every Minecraft player. to truly create your world and the story along with it. its absolutely beautiful...
Awesome!
How did you miss making a stable at the village
This is a whole another level of impressive
probably the most inspiring Minecraft vid I've watched
The idea and style of how you building those houses is blowing my mind 🤯
i literally had goosebumps multiple times, what you are doing is so amazing! keep at this, cause this is going to be insane!
this part reminds me of borderlands
Are you also able to get these on console?
This looks amazing you did an awesome job. Keep up the good work!👍
He’s teaching me more about history than social studies
My hometown in Wyoming was once a “hell on wheels” town, meaning it popped up as the transcontinental railroad was being built (we supplied coal). Our old downtown actually does look like an “old western” town; the parallel structure, the connected buildings, the flat roof fronts to make them look taller. It was burnt down in 1885 during the uh… Chinese Massacre, but it was rebuilt. The original fire station is still standing, and the exterior structure hasn’t been renovated at all. It’s really pretty.
I can't believe it's been 7 months since the first video came out
I hate how that looks like the new fortnite island.
How about adding tribel village in jungle biome with some treehouses
For the savanna you should have a witch doctor or spiritual place of worship
The dedication keep it up👍Its all for a greater cause.Our entertainment.Great documentary.The will power on this guy.😈He is dangerous👿
Kinda too glitchy
You are the best minecraft builder!
This villages that don't spawn naturally are really cool, but too bad there is no cowboy villager's texture :(
14:08 just wow. Holy poop. All i have to say.
Maybe for the snowy mountains you could incorporate a Hindu or Buddhist theme?
Oh my gosh... The wild west village just hit the right string in my heart <3
Can u please make a temple next for your indian fans
Can you make the snow area viking inspired? That would be so cool. with nods to norse mythologi as the worship sides.
Can you build minas tirith for your next big build
I use bedrock edition will this be bedrock Java or both?
Subbed at around 100k knew something was special about this channel very happy to see so much success Trixy
map looks kinda sus tbh
Could you mess around with a bit of traditional Korean architecture?
Bruh I’m poor, waddya mean “play the map”
Will there be like a cheat sheet that will have coords for every secret, in case we don’t miss anything when playing on the world, but personally I’d just want to look at it when I think I’ve completed my story
for the snowy mountains please add a fjord with a village inspired by historical viking buildings and old norwegian building example: Norwegian stave churches (a type of church build during the late viking age) viking longhouses ( can be both a mead hall(feasting hall) or a larg farm house (usaly only to large farms)) a sod roof house (houses with grass on top of them) Rorbuer Cabins ( a red fishing cabin that usaly are built on rocky coasts) three sword monument ( a monument for the unification of norway during the viking age (acualy built in 1983)) the fjord shoud eather have a road betwin some mountians or a tunnel through a mountian.
I can't process how long this took. Crazy but so cool
i really can't wait to play in this world when it finished and i really want to see you will put Mosques and how you will design them
Which shader are you using
Having seen your videos and this absolutely Gorgeous series in upgrading minecraft, asking a question, would you bring the same ideas for the different terrains in the overworld to the two other terrains of the Nether and the end, if so what would you do and how long would it be?
Will the map be available for ' JAVA ' only ?
If you do a q&a how many backup saves do you have and how long have you spent on this world?
I wish i could help you
@TrixyBlox can you upgrade the map to 1.18 and add an upgraded cave
for the tyga or how ever it is spelled you should do a russian style setting
Can you make the next house of worship the kaaba plzz it would be amazing for a muslim like me.
Ya know what? Imma play this when it comes out
Amazing 😍 You sound like TommyInIt + GeorgeNotFound
Petition to make trixyblox part of hermitcraft
This is amazing!
Amazing 😱
Is it gonna cost Monet?
Sus
Very nice transformation for the Mesa biome.  You've got a wild west town for the Cowboys and an outpost for the Outlwas, but i'm missing the american Indians with their tipis and marter stakes.  Would be very nice to add this on your world.  There's an other idea i have: In the past they used the rivers to transport logs, maybe that would fit in there too.
Your videos should last longer!
cozy jail
I can’t even believe how much time goes in to this!
You shood get a custom mod for the new biomes
Would be amazing if someone makes a mod to go with this to have NPC’s go on missions with you and other NPC upgrades and functioning shops and that!  Oh and police!
will this be a multiplayer server?
As a writer I always look up this guy work to get insperations. That jungle map is my favorite by far
Looks like Wano Kuni
:)
WE NEED A SOUNDTRACK  NOTEBLOCKS OR SOMETHING
Can't wait for everyone to be playing this awesome map and meanwile i'm gonna be begging to My parents for them to Buy me that Patreon
Can we download the world?
Cool idea would be to make a dedicated roleplaying server with this map having key npcs as part of your staff who don't just give the exact same quest but can give suitable rewards depending on the word state and "Main Story" completion. having certain quests create and destroy other questlines too would be fun. that would be an entire other thing but i'm pretty sure people in the community would love to help with a similar undertaking.
Will you upgrade this map to 1.18?
babe wake up trixyblox uploaded a new video
Yeah ^^
Amazing, no words to describe
When can you play this
February baby!!!
Add madir for India it will be cool
The Mesa is my favorite so by far! Keep going you are doing great!
Make a floating island
Man, this is simply amazing! Someone could create a server with this map when it come out and each biome would be a guild, and the guilds are in war with each other. It would be awesome
Mojang should hire you for Minecraft 2
Why has he not been invited to hermitcraft yet?
Are you going 2 use mcedit or something to generate the new & improved cavesystems underneath the map ? Would be a huge improvement
Bhuddest/Tibetan style place of worship for the mountains would be pretty neat :)
Minecraft on steroids:
I wish it was available in mobile
When you were talking about the steamboats for the mine system I thought that it would have been a cool idea to make like sunken steamboat somewhere in the Meisa of in between them maisa and the jungle that goes along with there like fight
Hi
When will be the map be available
5:51 Looks like valentine boys
Can you build a mosque for a prayer place!
Are you afraid of death?   Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
dude this looks so cool!!
the davinci of minecraft
Insane!!!!
this is amazing! can i get it in bedrock edition?
2:20 “I started to do a *little* more terraforming”
Is this in minecraft java  edition ?
Would it be available on phone
How to play in this world?
Caves and cliffs have been quiet ever since Trixy started making this 😳
This guy is too under rated
In the snowy mountains could we have a abandoned mountain rescue service or a yeti/abominable snowman
I wish a hadn't watch any of your video and found this map suddenly)) it would be much more amazing
I really wanna film an adventurer in the Mesa to the tune of Evil Ways by Blues Saraceno.  A former raider showing up to the Outpost, trying to work for a living, until Raiders show up for a slice...  And finally there's a reason to let the demon out of the box.
You forgot a schoolhouse, a general store, and a ranch
finally, i can now play rdr2 on my pc
I think one of the biomes should have a huge castle town maybe in the Tiga or the Snowy Mountans, ether would work but it would be cool and a lot of lore could go in it
I wish this was on bedrock
I learned more history from this video than I have in social studies
Are you going to do a playthrough series with any friends on this map, I'd be interested in watching
Hey, awesome work. For the snow biome up the mountains, why don’t you build something inspired by the dwarves kingdom from the Hobbit😌
Ad someone from the west, this is pretty accurate! Good job. And the builds are great too👍
wher did we can donwload this map bro its so woaw
I hate being in a poor family... I wish I could download this map... Awww man :(
Will you be making this compatible with bedrock? I want to play it but I don’t have Java.
It would be cool to see a world that's based off of steam punk or 'Arcane' it would be super cool
You should add guillotine machine ( don't know the spelling but i mean that machine used to chop heads )
You should add guillotine machine ( don't know the spelling but i mean that machine used to chop heads )
You should add guillotine machine ( don't know the spelling but i mean that machine used to chop heads )
Yes finally! this will 100% be my favourite place to explore in the world!
I’ve always dreamed of building a wild west town but here it is this is so good I love it
Small recommendation but maybe use gold buttons in the sleuthing are to sorta look like nuggets
Since the poor western towns didn’t have a church some of them would host at their house and it was called cowboy church.
Its wild west based, but you have the wagon traffic done like its in Britain.
Pls we need more likes ahhhhh
I've wondered if they could somehow upgrade the underwater temple.
IS he going to make the Nether and the END ?
Please add hindu temple
I was waiting for it and it is here now!! Yeah!
Is this playable on bedrock
The thumbnail looks an awful lot like the Lego bionicle island 🤨
Very thought out and looks awesome, I love it
You should put pride rock (from lion king) in the savanna biome.
i love thisssss
You should’ve added some Native American tribes or areas where they would stay
In the snowy mountains you should make a ruined castle that is falling apart and is threatening the stability of the region
This dude is amazing
THIS IS ACTUALLY BEAUTIFUL. I think it’s my favourite books yet, which is surprising because I’m usually not fond of the lack of greenery in the mesa.
U forgot a stable and barber
The banners for letters is something I’d never thought of. Thank you!
This is amazing. I hope I’ll be able to play on it soon, but I only have bedrock. Is there a way you could make available for bedrock when you do finish it? ❤️
Hey, you probably wont read this but it is worth a shot, do you think this is survival friendly to play on with friends?
There were no weapons stores in the old west. You got your gun or weapons from a traveling salesman or at the local mercantile when they had them. I know mc has no guns. And the leather store should be called a tack shop
Please tell what is seed
You should find a way to make it so each biome has its own soundtrack. It would be so cool to enter the Mesa biome and have some wild west music start to play.
Add mods so it’s cooler
It looks like red dead redemption
I really want to see this map at the end And i just hope someone make this map as a MMORPG Server
well done !
This one wins Everyone else go home
I swear to God that I mentioned this idea way before it happened
will this be on bedrock
Please add a temple in savanah
Yo do a really good job at narrating. I’m constantly entertained.
wow just wow
will this map be available to bedrock\console players ?
Bro you know what you should do you should add different music depending on the biome you're in
If you end up putting the download for the map in the description of one of your videos of this world IT BETTER NOT BE FOR JAVA EDITION ONLY UNDERSTOOD!?!
Mojave should and this Map to the Store
What shaders does he use? I love the glowing Ores!
*rewatches Rango*
I have been waiting for sooooo long
The radius of the railway curves look a little sharp but other than that another smashing episode in the USW.
That village reminds of that one murder mystery map
man just made rhodes from red dead
imagine playing these multiplayer and having to choose a race u know that like in what is it called western people natural abilities more life health and much more faster riding horse and i hope theres gun
You arę the beat Builder!!!
Viking Civ Next! SNOW BIOME!!!!
Is there going to be an addition for the nether and the end?? Going Interdimentional would be awesome! And it could add in the MC religion as well as keeping the bosses.
You Culd ask grian to help I imagne the colab
Will it possibly be free at one point? I don’t want to sound cheap or sound like a karen but just wanna know… sorry if i sound rude by asking “will it be free?” To a project that took someone weeks to build
Title should be minecraft at:22centuary
*Can you do an orthodox church in the ice biome please?*
I can't wait to play this
Still available on bedrock ?
You really have to include some Electroswing references in the Saloon
I hate that this is not on bedrock :(
where is the spawn point?
You should have made a place/camp for some indians, with those tall tents. You should also have made some stalls with horses in the town.
correct me if im wrong, he would be touching up on the sea monument at some point of time right?
include a Muslim religion please
Make the end portal place something cool
Hey man all these religious buildings that you add, I really appreciate it. The world's 3 largest religions are 1. Christianity, 2. Islam, 3. Hinduism. You did add churches and mosques but I would really like it if you add hindu temples. After all it is the 3rd largest religion and more than 1 billion people follow it. But sadly this religion is quite less known in spite being the 3rd largest religion.
Just for this... I'm gonna sub :D
Can you add a yeti easter egg on snow biome?
The worhtship of saten and so as Leike littel cult camps
Hehe wait. 16 million blocks. What the accual fuck
Can u add a Japanese theme for the snowy mountains
when the island is sus
I would be cool to have a norse mythology for the snowy moutians
Wonder what texture packs can go well with this, a gun mod will be really cool and this world can be like an ultimate SMP
ahh there it comes, the milking
FINALLY SOMEONE HAS DONE THIS
Have your sins been forgiven today and forever?  Think about this.   The God of the bible,  the One True God made us to worship him, obey him, and enjoy him forever.   We break His laws daily by not putting Him first, not thanking Him like we should, we lie, we lust, we have sex before marriage, we dishonor our parents, we covet things other people have, we take God's name and use it in vain,  we use it in a low manner,  sometimes as a cuss word,  (God is holy and even His name is holy),  we don't love like we should, etc.  In doing so we're saying He's not a good provider,  He's a liar,  He's untrustworthy,  He's not worthy of praise.   All these things and more are counted against us.   The bible says God is the just judge of the world and one day He will settle the score for all the wrong we've done.  God is holy meaning He is righteous (morally perfect in thought, word,  and deed)  It also means He is set apart and higher than us.  God  being good, must punish all sin or wrong doing in the world.  This means that if you sin one time God will cast you in hell for eternity.   Because He is good and He doesn't turn a blind eye to sin.  But there is good news.  2000 years ago Jesus the Son  of God came into this world and lived a perfect life ( He never sinned once)  and He died on the cross taking the wrath that we deserve and paid the penalty for the sins we committed.   The bible says that if you will repent (confess and forsake your sins)  and trust in what Christ did on the cross (He took the wrath of God that was meant for you and I) then all your sins will be forgiven and when you die you will be in heaven with God and all who believe for eternity.  Jesus died and on the third day He rose from the grave.  Get right with God today don't wait.  Once you die after that comes the judgement.  Hebrews 9:27 It's the most important thing you can do.   You must be born again John 3:7 If you repent and trust in what Christ did on the cross it shows that you've been born again or born spiritually.   Right now you're dead in your sins and you can't see the beauty of Jesus Christ but after you trust in Christ all the things you hate about God like obeying him,  serving Him,  loving Him and others,  reading the bible, praying and going to church you will love to do those things because God changes your heart.   That's how you know you have been born again and forgiven.  Please think long about this and ask me any questions you have as this is the most important thing you can ever think of in your life.   An eternity in hell (darkness and a lake of fire the bible describes it, with weeping and gnashing of teeth)  or an eternity out of that place and into the loving arms of God who is infinitely glorious, has infinite knowledge and has infinite power to do all that He pleases.   You decide.   Have a great day!
In the taiga or mountain biomes you can make an old norse town
Master-class designing and building aside, can I say the music is fantastic? There should be a way to have that as ambient music in a server with this world
love these builds such a talented guy
Can you play even if your on a different console like Xbox or play station
this guy needs to be invited to hermitcraft or some sort of building smp.
That song at the end WOW!! What a nice touch to have a talented producer making custom tracks for you. You seriously blow my expectations out of the water every time.
Thats basically my exact picture of the wild west. Also I love your content keep going and the world looks really nice.
minecraft red dead go brrrrrr
Thank you for doing this I love everything you do.
Those outlaws are manifestily destined to own the entire mesa
Well thanks dude Now I have to replay red dead redemption 2 all over again :D  Anyway nice job, it look fucking awesome
If Minecraft looked like nobody would play as they can’t match how good it looks like
Hey in the end I think you should make a new end fortress I knew stronghold in the centre of the island in the end the Dragon should be defeated already and there will be instructions so large and so creative would be impossible to get through them all
Dude, I litterally can't wait to play in this world.
You probably won't read this, but getting your girlfriend involved in this project is a genius idea to grow her channel. Props for that!
I probably missed this... but is the map getting 1.18 update?
If this is completed i would do a actual survival series with this on an actual channel
We really have to pay for this map? WTF?
pls more
Maybe you should build a skeleton of a dead dragon
You guys should make this a rp server when it's done
Will this be free to download?
bro that video felt like 2 seconds ;(
oh man tho I know I can't play it, I can't wait for it to finish
Could you tell me what dimensions you made the world in WorldPainter?
what you have built and accomplished is so amazing I don't even know what to say it's just amazing!
this world HAS to be turned into a 100 days, and maybe add some mods here and there to make the experience more immersive (i.e making the villagers skin corelate with the biome they live in)
I have an idea trixyblox in the mountain biome build a secret frozen village under it
Btw is the world available for bedrock
you are so creative bro nice talent
Will this map be available for bedrock edition?
wait a second, is that a custom island, or an actual seed?
how can we play it when its done?
cool mine idea, make a small part of a mine dangerous, place tnt that can explode
USW= united states of wakanda
waited 2 months for a 15 min video smh
Fortnite
👂⏰🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Flee eternal hell🔥, cry out to God to save you, because Jesus Christ died and is now risen at the right hand of God and he makes intercession. Only in him my Lord Jesus Christ is salvation found.  Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼. Jesus Christ is God in the flesh. Came  to destroy the works of the devil.  Plea and call out to God to save you from your sins. Please plea with him. He saved me from all my sins and forgave me. I have eternal life only because he died and now is risen at the right hand of God and he ever lives to make intercession for us.⏰🥰😊🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼⏰⏰⏰👐🕯️🙏🏼🥺👂⏰🗣️  There is no sin that Jesus Christ can't deliver you from. So go to him and quit hiding your sins , tell him and beg him to set you free from them. He did it with me the chief of sinners. Now I am walking in victory by grace alone.🙏🏼😊🙏🏼🙏🏼
Ok so, i know noeone is gonna se ethis, but what if you make a underground city?:0 but more like, an dead underground one, knowing that the warden its gonna be in the game with their own biomes, it will bw cool if we had a lore part that has something to do with the underground and the warden, like another civilization with a own stories, sorry if its difficult, its just an idea, live ur videos so much really <3
This is incredible liked
Its incredible how he edits the videos to perfection added with the shaders its just amazing.
Will there be custom armor and custom outfits you can put on ur character to make this less like vanilla Minecraft? Also will there be western guns available in the weapons shop?
And what about Nether or End remaking?
All this work for 10 minutes of a video
You should put a stable in it, it would be amazing for travel and other stuff
The Western town is my favourite so far
I need to play your map it looks so good
man i'm kinda dissapointed it's for patreon
Once it is done, how will bedrock players be able to play on it?
Wait I have to buy this?🥺🥺🥺
Can you do this on bedrock too?
Imagine the world being this beautiful and then you just build your little box house
Players are just gonna grief the whole thing.
Its on patreon :( I started watching on episode one and always wait for publish and i just found out
You made mosque in desert and church in Plains so please make a Hindu temple called 'Ram Mandir' . you can search images of both village and Temple in Google. Please make it 🙏🙏🙏 because it has a bad history. "According to some beliefs, it was originally the site of a Hindu temple that was demolished to construct a mosque known as Babri Masjid. For their part, Muslims claim that the land was titled to them and Mir Baqi built the mosque on it in 1528 on orders of the first Mughal emperor, Babur but problems are solved and now it is under construction" Please make it and subscriber from india🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳( and I don't want to spoil your idea of African village but make an Indian village besides temple and you can African village in distance)🤟🤟🤟
I remember red dead redemption from your builds the town design is just like armadillo in red dead
imagine loading into a new world and having naturally generated buildings look better then anything you'd ever build in survival :(
underrated
I will sub to your patreon if the map or world is done
will there be a way to get around? maybe a transport system of some kind, seems like a long treck to get from place to place
omg 😍😍😍😍😍💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💗💗💗💗💗💗💗❤❤❤❤❤❤
so good
Could you please transfer this world over to the Bedrock edition?
For the snow biome, please do a norse place of worship, possibly mixed with a Game of Thrones weirwood tree.
I love it but one major question, is this the most civilized and developed biome?? Seems weird since it is the Wild West and on the fringes. If the Badlands biome is so developed the plains biomes should have a city larger than this. Also  would explain the massive train lines. They should connect to the rest of the map not just this biome.
Can you make it for bedrock as well
Thank goodness world edit is a thing
you should add another city to the biome casue u have so much free space and so many passanger carts on the train that it doesnt make any sense to have so many carts for one town
You should join hermitcraft
will you add a custom mod? that would be fun
The movie series is what I wanted to happen letsss goooo
Are you going to add mods
how do you download this when its out for free
Nice minecraft around the world 👏👏👏👏
I think you should add a brakevan to the goods train, since it's important
Dude you forgot horses. Its the wildwest afterall.
You should paste in some caves from 1.18 will save you some time, and make caves interesting too on this map (unless ur already doing the caves)
I can’t believe it’s been a year already
This is so cool. I have a question, are you going to do the nether and end too?
if u finish we can download it for free or we need to be a member?
This biome makeover is the best one yet! I LOVE the railroad system keep up the amazing work!
Please make the biomes temple/church be a pantheon based on the greco roman gods.
Maybe try to make Asian culture
DUDE ADD ANY JAPANESE STYLE RUINS OR INDIAN STYLE RUINS/TEMPLES (I GUESS ITS WORKSHIP PLACE) BUT THERE DESIGN LOOK COOL I VISITED LAST TIME WHEN I WENT TO INDIA
Please add a major dripstone and lush cave
Build next video snow moutains
You legend
This man fucking upgraded a goddamn minecraft
Here’s a tip. Instead of calling the hotel a hotel, it would be best to call it an Inn. This is more historically accurate and fits the theme a bit better as hotel wasn’t a common word back then.
This man is the litteral definition of quality over quantity
i hope this isnt going to be a patreon thing where you gotta pay to use it
Has Buddhism been done yet?
Will it be available for pe players??
an old fort would be cool in this biom. It was destroid by the slaves that a big company used in the mines and now after years it became home to some bandits that try to hijack a train and steal the gold.
Should 100% add a small bamboo forest with a village hidden it the village hidden in the bamboo and base the designs Japanese buildings
idk if youve domne this but why dont you add minecart rails on the trtain track so we can ride all around like were actually on a train
hindu temple
Amazing so its not free?Guess il wait for 5-10 years when it will be free then i have amazing patience you know
@PewDiePie .
Bedrock or java
Dont forget the caves!
Trixy when you are building the snowy mountains we need some kind of mysterious worship place with a small side story of its own to work out why it’s there
Literally this type of hardwork should be on trending 🤯🤯🤩🤩 Very sad to say see that some illogical things are on trend...
This shouldn't be a survival series. It should be an rpg game itself
Hello
If you can do just an other city will be better
we already got 877k likes and for the savanna i hope you make a big fortress
I think this is the best video i've ever seen
For the ore and mob generation, you'll use the basic Minecraft codes right?
I recommend adding a quarry of sorts. These were very common in the late 1700s - early 1800s  Also, add some camps, varying in sizes, around the mesa!
You should make a custom nether with dead animals and mobs and you should call it Lost World.
May I call you sensei ?
Now how much lag is this
Constructive criticism:  1. Don't use the "Mr Beast captions", they don't work and just make my head hurt. 2. Move the camera back from your face, it's too close for comfort. 3. Trap doors on the whole of that bridge look bad, like a solid wall.
This is amazing! Quality right? Also can we add additional mods or datapacks with resources for the datapacks?
Is is amazing, and I would love for you to include a customised stronghold
this is the most impressive minecraft project i have ever seen.
Hey just a question TrixyBlox, but as someone who bought Minecraft on the switch for a friend of mine for Christmas (they shall remain anonymous, for privacy reasons.. even though they already know who they are) will you be able to play this on the switch?  As both my friend and I are major fantasy fans and like the thought of adventuring, and this world is like a candy store, or a paradise for us, and if we can't that would be a huge let down.
Where will people live in mesa? Please make some houses it feels so odd that it has all ptofesion buildings but no houses.
In the frozen mountain, PLEASE include an American missile silo and a Soviet missile silo, where the player has to choose one side and help them destroy the other.
Finishing... I just buy
I just think that there is a guy holds tnt and next is shocking
This is so awesome!!!!! You should add custom villagers for some of the biomes, that would be a cool addition. Keep up the work!!
You can make a temple in taiga
The map is going to be insane
I've been trying to find an excuse to get back into Minecraft and i think when this map comes out this will be a perfect excuse, maybe i'll download a few quality of life mods to finally try and beat the enderdragon and build a base im proud of. Who knows maybe i'll even invite some friends or siblings? Good work pal, you and Steph are legends!
I can’t believe there was no inclusion of those little two man pump karts (I’m not sure of their name) or some unmarked/shallow graves throughout the area
I think this is my favorite biome so far, those bridges from a distance look amazing
Hey maybe for the savannah biome you could add a hindu kovil. its a very colourful build and i think you'll have a fun time building it. or you could put a buddhist temple for the savannah
https://youtu.be/s-WjtsJSMZA
mojang should hire you
i wonder what youll do to the nether😳
finely
On the ice biome add like an ice castle to it with a sweet but dark story
I hope he customises at least a bit of the nether
Build indian temple in Savannah biome transformation
I think You could build more cities in this biome. It would be much better
make a large totempole in the savannah!
How can I download the map 🗺?
Please spread this message, “For God so loved the world He gave His one and only Son,for those who believe in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)
What PC does this guy have
are there gonna be tunnels under whole the map?
The way he is going crazy with the upgrading with so much detail just makes me speechless. its incredible
I just kinda want this world when You're done with the project, i'll really appriciate it. Your project is amazing and very beautiful to see, can't wait when it's done! A new SUB from me!!
I don't want these series to end 😭
can't wait to see the savana <3
make a synagogue
Why didnt you do a horse stable? Its in vanilla  minecraft and its super cowey style
Come on people like it up
Hey, Trixy, is this forever going to be java only or will you export it to bedrock?
This world will have custom mobs and other kind of challenges for the casual days?
Please tell me its possible to download this for pocket edition when its finished, that’d be so sick
Mate you need to make a abandon mineshafts in multiple areas with mega caves with alot of ore and maybe some lore????
Will there be 1.18 caves in this USW?
This looks insane 🤯
Possibly include a buddhist temple? There would be a lot of gold involved.
Imagine a 100-200 player Hunger games on this map 😳
Come on guys! Let’s hit that like goal!
Will this be available in bedrock
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Is the project gonna be free when this is over?  Extra question  Will you be adding some type of mod to make the villagers looks and some give quest on that sort of thing
Hey trixy this getting boring I dare you do all the island
That is incredible
Once this is all finished can you do a video where you explore it?
Hey you can add a temple to jungle biom as I can only see or watch these videos as. I can't afford MINECRAFT but I can still watch it so please take my request as MINECRAFT costs a lot in India.
Hey trixy why would you transform the whole island into an animation minecraft
suggestion: you could make trains teleport you inside the train in another location, making it an option for fast travel, (maybe even make the player pay to use it)
As a suggestion, you could've added stables in the Mesa biome as horses are often used in the Wild West.
If this was 170M block world … 💀
How about ocean you didnt made no ocean biome
What's going to happen with the Nether?
I can definitely imagine these two growing old and still making Minecraft videos together like they were 18
Dont forget stronghold.
The town kinda reminds me of Valentine in Red Dead Redemption 2 lol, all u need is a stables 😂
thanks for doing this
i love this video
Sick project
I keep saying this in every vid, there is nowhere enough food in this entire world. Where do all the towns get their food?
You should do a Viking inspired civilization for the snowy mountains biome
Please please join hermitcraft season 9
PLSSS MAKE THIS AVAILABLE ON BEDROCK
The only sad bit about this is that there are no Colt revolvers here... But hey, we have pickaxes and TNT!
Is this map going to cost money??
Last episode I asked this question but I don’t think anyone saw it and I just really want to know is this bedrock compatible
Can you please make it down load able
Suggestion: I would love if you added some sort of ancient dwarven kingdom in the mountain biome.
Kudos to you @TrixyBlox, Someday you will see my comment and perhaps you may also upgrade my 7 year old 100mb world..
bro can u gave the world to the mcpe ? i hope u can do it 😁
Please add temple in Savannah biome transformation
Add mobs pls
gallows but no brothel? i mean if ur gonna be historically acurate..
try something swedish! in sweden there are a LOT of red plank houses because of the copper mine in dalarna as it is called. (they turned the copper into red dye) there was also many many potato farms at the time i think, it could be a whole other time but anyways. The potatoes was first only planted for the flower, it was seen in many royal gardens. Later they found that the little root thingy was eatable, and remember that this was in swedens most hungry years, so to this day people still call potatoes the "hero ofd sweden". Love ur vids and hope you consider including my idea!
You forgot stables    Also everything else is amazing thanks
https://youtube.com/channel/UCpbf1oycLM3NaCyYUrEjpnw
the amount of wood used but not a single tree in sight :3
Tango Tek’s villager mod would help really bring the custom villages to life
Wait he’s also doing the nether?!?!?!?!!!!! *faints in Steve*
Yooooo this just keeps getting better and better.
Yes haw!
Eat your cereal and press the link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-97M7rK-rs&t=173
This world is the definition of "imagination can be a reality if you really work hard for it"
You should really add some First Nation’s camps and such
I can’t wait to download this world but I just hope I can get my new computer first cuz my current one can’t run anything past 1.16
While building the town you mentioned liking the idea of a steampunk Wild West. There's actually a sub-genre of Steampunk called cattle punk that is exactly that.
Add some NPC AND ADD CUSTOM WEAPON AND NEW MOBS
House: Exists Trixyblox: i WoNdEr WhO lIvEs HeRe?
In the savanna you should make some sort of watering hole
cant wait to see youtubers play this! 😳💕
Can i buy the world in bedrock???? Plsss yes
DUDE, this is INSANE!
You should use Farplane2 to increase render distance without decreasing fps
After finished this uncedible project, you could do the same thing with the Nether and end
Idea:  Adding stables for horses, they are very important in the whole Wild West theme that you have going on (beautiful by the way) I think it would be a great addition to the village! :D
Wow  this build is cool but can you please transform Spamal's minecraft survival base?
If I know anything about the Wild West, I think that hotel would be a little more than just a normal hotel
that saloon looks like the one in Armadillo from Red Dead Redimption
Bro that was so good keep up the good work I hope this blows up
This might be a bit much, but it’d be cool to have an entire rail transit system between some nations. It’d seem as if cargo was being carried from nation to nation. And maybe a few people want to relocate from their hometown to somewhere better.
You are the best I want this world as soon as I can
hi i cant find the last epic western soundtrack on other pages how is it called and is it on spotify it would be great to listen to this music. btw great vid. nevermind found it sry
This giving me RDR2 vibes
WoW
Well done this is so good! It should be a new minecraft survival map!
Are we going to get a vid for the caves?
The villagers are lucky to have you tbf
Could you build a knight order in one of the next videos? Maybe one based on the german knight order.
i remmember him when he didnt even have a million
Just an idea... when you were making the second train with the goodies you should've added some mobs (pillagers) to protect/gard it. That would've been a awesome detail.
This remind me about Kelly wild west
Can you make the train move?
I grew up in what used to be a western town in Oregon and you can really tell in some parts of the town. The oldest buildings are obviously scattered like the image provided but downtown the buildings are right next to each other like in the movies. Including old buildings like the bank. You can really see where the dirt roads used to be. We also have a train track running through that part of town alongside a water tower and a large mysterious "W" on one of the, now to be, tattoo shops that really helps you imagine what things used to look like. After a great flood they began to expand the town from what is considered "down town" and even 100 years later we still have town events like the hops and heritage festival or Saturday market. Only now with canopies instead of tents and stakes. The town of Independence Oregon has a lot of history, Lewis and Clark traveled through our town as it was part of the Oregon Trail and is considered today to be the third largest urban area in Polk County.
How can I get to that world man it's to realistic and you are representing the true Minecraft
Is this available on bedrock?
the mason is giving me rdr2 vibe
Nicee
Noice
i think adding custom 1.18 caves to this world would really bring everything together once it’s done :)
Hey, I know this took a lot of time, but if you used the Immersive Railroading Mod for minecraft it would have really brought the railroading system like to life, and it would have been super cool
soooo good
oh no it needs payment sad
maybe you can build a skilift in the snowy mountains
I think for the savanna, adding either a stave church like the Vikings, or a gurdwara, a place of Sikh worship.
Idea- back then it was Gaol not Jail
Trixi is so good at bulliding
Please add hindu temple
Why dont you use the train mod for moving trains?  link is in the desription of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP0-xzSyfS0
You should add the sherif
For the snowy mountains I would recommend a snow storm in the air.
i cannot wait to play this
Man after this insane project you should get into some building tutorials cuz your freaking awesome, literally Grian standard or dare I say, even better. If you don't know who Grian is then check him out lol  Edit: This gives my actual goosebumps
It is always so much fun watching these video's and at the end im always like "whut, its already over?!!"
Every village gets its own believe. Maybe let science take over in a village for once?
Hmmmm can I play this in pe  [pocket edition]
If you ever do an FAQ, I would like to know if you ever procrastinated something and told us it would be for us to explore? :D Also, please don't stress yourself. No need to apologize that you took more time. Take your time, I don't want you to have a burnout at the end of this
hey trixy i have been watching your videos and the thing that you should definitely add a house that contains items from every place like a government house just an idea.
yeah only three biomes have left
Bye up
Im playing bedrock edition  Vannila player so lucky..
i would love to have a hindu temple or muslim masajid or both they would be perfect in snowy mountains to pose as himalayas
I was so excited to finally hear a person saying real and actual train/locomotive talk thank you so much
suggestion: you could add abundances of certain ores in biomes like the mesa so Gold is actually more abundant in that biome
add the sikh worship place in your next biome
This guy's hardwork and talent is at its peek Im so jealous
there should be two villiages in one biome that is more habitable, and maybe just a sigle house in one that isn't as much.
i want to play this map free plz plz plz
plz plz plz
dude plz make your world free to download
When I do get this map through patreon, will I have to install my own shaders or does it come with its own?
He must have a great computer. Like, it can have shaders at max render distance and still not lag
It will be cool if you make a nether and end biom  so if you go to end or nether  it will be a story of the piglins
Hey Trixy, im a bit late but i have a question for you. what will you bo doing with the nether? are you just leaving it, or changing it into something amazing?
Can you please make a steve church in the snowy biome
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that you need Jesus as your savior, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
The real question is where will the stronghold be? 🤔
i wanna see praising ground/area like a buddha statue
This could be the map of the year
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life7
Maybe you can include a Hindu temple for one of the biomes? BTW how how do you do it
How do i download it my friend how tho
This reminded me of the gerudo in breath of the wild.
Are you gonna upload the map to the Minecraft bedrock store so us bedrocky bois to play your good map 👏
this shows how a GOD created a WORLD
For the next Biome or for some other biome , maybe you can include some Indian inspired building and temples
I bet once this is done it would be like breath of the wild
Could you make a giant volcano with the new height limit.  Here's a basis for a story if you want one, it used to be a beautiful mountain with a very happy community. And inside was a temple with the heart of their city in the center of it.  One day the village was raided and the heart was stolen.  The volcano then erupted and destroyed the city.  Everything accept for a few parts of the temple and the buildings/trees were destroyed, with the leftover building abandoned.  And the raiders took over the volcano and took advantage of the heat from the lava, building back a steampunk themed town.  But there is said to be an underground village of the natives, who are training an army to find and take back heart, and restore their mountain to it's former glory.  You do what you want with that, and I really love your videos, keep up the good work.
Hey what about a casino or a hospital
Is there any chance that you c an make the whole city of L.A
I want to play this map just so I can move that train track around haha that's a lot of bridge 👀.
Ngl, Im pretty dissappointed that he didnt include a Clint Eastwood reference.
At the end it’s like in a apocalips and you are the last human
Mayan culture is awesome with their gods and how they worship would be awesome in this world.
the one issue i have with this amazing map is that the cacti have heads so when i collect them ill also get a head
I love this build so much
Creeper Wil ruined it
Bro did he just say "Other Realms" MY GUY ARE WE GETTING END CITY REVAMPS!
This world's lore is Rivaled by only Ph1lza's.
This is getting me thinking of Red Dead Redemption 2, would be cool if you re-created the Red Dead Redemption map some day
These videos are always such a pleasure to watch and they really get my worldbuilding brain going haha. Great job to both of you as always
4:26 "B A K"
Nooo. There is no need to rush. Don’t worry and focus on making it awesome.
Do a survival series with Steph on it once your done building it.
For the snowy mountains in the future I hope you do a Norse Viking type city if not a Siberian tribal village I think that’s be really cool tbh
If only there was a ghost town
How to download a minecraft map?
Holy Man I Could Not Believe My Eyes
Here's some ideas for the taiga area: I think the taiga village should be inspired by Russian architecture. Considering the snowy forests and everything, I think basing it off of Russia would be really cool, and it would also be a really good chance to make an awesome orthodox-style cathedral.   On top of that, another idea is that the taiga settlement could actually be more like a proper city rather than a small village. Considering that there are shipwrecks scattered around the island, that means that someone had to have built them at some point, and the island needs to have a proper trading center where all the peoples of the island can go to trade and access the outside world. That's why I think the Taiga settlement should be an actual city, as it would be the only place where the islanders have trade access to the outside world, and would have shipbuilding drydocks capable of launching those large ships that we've seen in the form of several shipwrecks.  If you choose to take this route and make the Taiga settlement a city, then lore-wise, it could be that after the jungle city and civilization fell into ruin, the peoples of the taiga overtook the status as premier civilization on the island, developing a large city to replace the now abandoned jungle city as the main trading center on the island.
Next time, can we have a buddhist temple/monastery in the snow Mountains?
Will this map be compatible with mobile because I want to play this map but isn't have a pc
Kinda looks like PEI
I can’t wait
this is insane it makes sense why it took a while
Wow, this is great. Blows my mind that only 2 people are making this entire map. Think it'd be really cool if someone made a server with the different civilizations.
GODDAMN BRO it's getting insane every time! Can't wait to travel on this map by my own !!
All the stuff you do is impressive but this took you 3 months man
TERRAFORM THE END
Can you do a final video on this when it is finished where you go back through and touch things up more? Also are the new caves from 1.18 going to be emulated in the underground sections (if present)
Please do hindu temples next please
Should he do the deep dark
It’s still minecraft, right?
I can only imagine the Villager's speaking in a western accent, "Well whaddowe have ere? Now listen uh you wouldn't happen to have dem dere emeralds now would ya?"
This project is monumental and amazing. I am really excited to see the final product. I hope that many YouTubers will play on this world and I hope that they will make tons of money from this hard work
I wish the map is free
Will the underground still have a Minecraft feel? Like natural ores and caves including new update, or only the big tunnel?
y'all have seriously outdone yourselves this time! Another episode that is beyond incredible!
Omggggggg how are you so good at this?!
Here before 250K Like Goal
You should make a sky kingdom in the center. Like, with copper and gold buildings, and it's on a cloud or something. And a volcano island far to the north, with a book in a chest telling you how to get there.
Ninja village in mountain please
Will the world have normal ore generation so we can mine if we play it?
ik u have 2m subs but your still underrated we need more subs now
OH MY GOD ITS UP OMGGGGGG I'VE BEEN CHECKING EVERY FREAKING WEEK IM SO EXCITED
the only thing this sick town is missing is a graveyard
I was expecting to see some ranches
This feels like Breath of the Wild scale of world, and I love it. Definitely playing this when it comes out!!!
So are we going to have to buy this world? Or when it comes out will it be free?
Can you get it on bedrock
Could you use command blocks to make the trains more functional, teleport the player to a moving train scene area, then teleport them to their intended destination?
After all of this is done, can you make a world to showcase all the buildings as a sort of museum world?
Probably not, but when it’s done can u play it on Xbox
Imagine playing this game and don't have a house, so you build box house cuz you don't know how to build ;-;
What about birch
The only question I have is how he manages to record it the way he does 😅
"We've done good, but we only have the Taiga, Mesa, Savannah, Chilidog, Hamburger, Airplane, Cat, Dog, Squirrell...
Lemme download this now
That railroad is intimidating—in a good way. This looks fantastic! I only wish I had a gaming pc so I could play this! I’m sad I’m missing out. Welp, going to Steph’s channel to see the good old lore! Enjoy the process—don’t ever forget that.
Oh my this is phenomenal
Will this be on bedrock?
This build is absolutely amazing, all the builds combined probably took 600 hours and a lot of effort, you will do anything to make your fans happy and man you did that in a sick way, keep up the amazing work!
Please do a video on how to make these buildings plz
The fact that you're planning on upgrading the other dimensions IN ADDITION to what you've already done is insane! Your dedication to this is very admirable.
WHERE'S THE HORSE STABLES?!!!
I wish I could play this. My mom doesn't trust patreon but my Minecraft doesn't work with maps for some reason so it wouldn't matter. I really hope to see some people playing this so that I can still enjoy it!
@TrixyBlox A Buddhist  temple  would be good with the monks
Wonder how the lighting situation is going to work, I'm just imagining the mobs the second it becomes night time
When this is done you should make a compilation of all the vids
welp all i can do is like and support you since I cant even download it after its done since I cant afford the patrion
The best minecraft builder is trixyblox of course in my opinion
So Epic!!♥️
This project is what's minecraft all about.
Wotaah
I can’t wait to get this map I’ll probably re install scape and run parasites that will make the stuff more action packed and stuff
How much will this cost when it is released in the minecraft marketplace?
Please please pleaseeeee do something Japanese or Asian culture related for the snowy biome!!
I want to se  a masjid
This map will be the fucking best!
You should stream your work
Are you going to add a dragon
can mabye make this avalible for bedrock?
poggers
M
Where did they got all this wod for the building's from, I mean there is not a single tree in the biom but city's out of tons and tons of wood xD
me thinking the village was going to be the main thing bc there’s no way he can top it. the trains: 😂 the mines: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
a pagan based thing or a atheist lab
we havent hit the like goal yet poeple
Hey trixy, on of the cool ideas I couldn’t get out of my head for the mess biome was the feature and inclusion of the iconic rock formation from radiator springs, from cars. I don’t know what your thoughts on that are but it would be a really neat feature.
you should do an airship fleet for transporting rescources -and sky pirates
I AM SO MAD. he FORGOT the armoursmith in the wild west town! how could he?  this might be the one thing that will change my mind about subscribing to his patreon to get this map 😡 edit: i calmed down a bit now and am still going to get the map but frankly, the armorsmith being forgotten is still pretty dissapointing, but when a man builds a 16 million block map you cant expect him to do it all perfect. it's still a really cool map even with a very lightly imperfect wild west town
When you get to the snowy mountain biome could you do a viking village I feel like it would suit it well.
Will ur world be available in mobile when it realizes
And can you make a muslim civilization
Once this is done, I'm definitely exploring it in VR. This is going to be insane
For the snowy mountains, there could be a big ice cavern with ice spikes hanging down from the sealing, also being a research site too?
For the snowy mountains I personally think that you should build a abandoned stronghold with the Endportle. Like a castle built into the side of the mountain. And for the village there I think you should make like a bunch of mountain shacks licked by bridges. As well as a mine, diamond, iron, redstone, or lapis in the side of the mountain and maybe if you think the is a cool Idea near the mine you could have a dorf stronghold. You make up the story, like this Idea if you think this is a good idea.
Do the  caves 😁
He should add some oil rigs
Hey is there a mobile on this building
To the nether it upgrade the nether fortress
snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy  snowy
snowy mountins
For the taiga biome, suggestions can include:  Traditional Russian inspired architecture, this is especially so for the churches (however that'd be at least 3 total churches on the map)  Traditional Japanese inspired achitecture. Adding volcanic activity to allow for hot springs etc. is also an idea. This option could allow for the featuring of buddhism on the map.  Something viking/scandanavian inspired.
I'm excited to play this
This is awesome but is it gonna be available for bedrock edition
Hello, could you send me the seed of the world where you are building because it looks phenomenal and I would like to see it thanks excellent video 👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!
Maybe the mountain biome could have a forgotten village thought to be abandoned that was home to more evokers (cause they got the color scheme) as they conducted mysterious experiments and research after many earthquakes were ravaging their village. (Took inspiration from the Incas maybe that could help you design the village if you use it.)
fineally you uploud it trixyblox
You may also add oil rigs
Maybe for the snowy areaa you could build a Buddhist temple?
I can't imagine how long you have to make this. All I'm gonna say is, get some rest, take your time, no need to rush cuz every second of waiting is worth it! The build is phenomenal!!
This...this will be the first world Minecraft purchase...
Are you afraid of death?   Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
You should’ve build a little farm house somewhere in the mesa
Congrats on 2mil
Will the train lead to other villages in the biome? @TrixyBlox
You forgot a stall in the town
can some one try building this in survival mod and the reason I'm not going to try is because I'm not good at building
Do a place for the Greek gods
aaaaa i love it!!!
What if you make a mod with items to correspond with the biomes - like steampunk armor and mining tools from the mesa antique jewelry and gold items from the desert wool clothing for the colder biomes and so on and so forth
I love seeing massive builds being put together so I hope you keep on doing them, maybe not one after the other but I would love to be able to see worlds that you have poured your soul into making them because it makes me excited to play such a large scale world.  Can't wait to play!
Did anyone else let out a little squeal when they noticed the video had come out? :D
I think you should make another outpost with white stone, you can get an idea of what I'm talking about from West Bound in Roblox.
You guys are legends
ITS FINALLY HERE
Massive props to you! If I were to attempt anything half as good as this it would take me decades! Absolutely insane!
You should do a Sky island and you should make a riddle to find it. I think it would make a nice fit in this world.
im so hype to play on this map !!!!
save the swamp boime in 1.19
Could you make a city for me please?🤠
this guy just insane
I have a suggestion for what you could do for the Nether, and that’s having inverted and/or Demonic versions of things from the main world.
Could you make a deep cave that has a overworldish theme like Ark’s aberration or subnautica’s jelly shroom cave
Bro you need to make a toy story quest for the mesa
In the Savannah, you guys should add a ranch inspired by Beecher's Hope from Red Dead Redemption 1 and 2. Look up pictures of it you'll see what I mean.
In the nether, you could turn the nether fortress/bastions into war fortresses, with different mob ranks, a wither-related religion/cult, prisons with custom NPC’s if they are being added. And tons of different rooms with different styles. A few ideas are a vault filled with gold blocks, though heavily guarded. A goldsmith, a weaponry, throne rooms, an alchemist-y room with brewing stands, potion ingredients in barrels, and lots of witches, a chapel-like room, which at the head has wither skeleton skulls and soul sand or some kind of mega-structure summoning portal, and possibly, a bit of insight on how this world was created and their relationship to the other dimensions.
GET IT TO 250K LIKES GUYS
You should partner with Mumbo Jumbo to add redstone!
God Bless https://youtu.be/BlPZ2gvcaoY God Bless https://youtu.be/BlPZ2gvcaoY
Red dead redemption in minecraft
For any additional mesa ideas, some river barges to transport stuff along with the steampaddle boats as well as maybe some hermit shacks spread about the Mesa at random in bizarre hard to reach locations
This is 100% my favourite series on youtube
Love all these builds! Been binge watching this series, just found your channel (subscribed obvi). Definitely think a horse ranch/corral is needed for the wild west theme since horseflesh was very important in this era. Horses were heavily used in the making of rail roads and mining hubs aaannnndddd in robbing them. An outlaw without a horse isn't worth the spurs he walked in on.
This guy build this for long time so don't dislike this video because it took him long time
Seriously bloody impressive! Have a great christmas you two <3
This man just built Wano
TrixyBlox, I think you should add some birch log in the plains because that's how Minecraft works
one word describes this world...EPIC 🤩
Last time i can ask this, but i wish you made the savanna indian themed. Thank you.
oh boy i cant wait to tear apart this world with my bare hands
i NEED that map
Can u put boss on it?
I think I’m gonna make a server out of this
trixy the one you should to do the snowy biome is build a fortress or a abandoned fortress
How much will it cost to download this world when it's finished ?
Pagan is what I want to see as a religion
This is absolutely mind blowing how detailed this whole series is. Could you do the Snowy peaks next?
you are crazy!
How did you terraform? Was a script or did you place blocks including everything underground?!
my guy msu town a nasa computer
This just gets better and better
Make a dungeon with a hidden room with a map of the world
How long has it been since you touched grass?
I would like to see a Eastern Orthodox Church.
I love barrels as a decoration block, but in a village they can result in a LOT of fishermen, and why would there be so many fishermen in the bone dry mesa? Maybe when digging and expanding those big mines the workers stumbled on a series of caves, going deep into the earth. What if down there they found all sorts of caves; ones filled with crystals and others tall as cathedrals with long stalactites and floors uneven with sharp stalagmites. Perhaps some caves seemed to have faint, old paintings on the walls which almost seem to move in the flickering torchlight, and even aquifers with strange, pale fish (or fish-like creatures), their meat having a bizzare and delicious taste: rumored to even enhance the senses of some who eat them. These fish would surely become commodities, causing skilled fishermen to rush to the mesa... but what if those faded paintings were a warning from people long ago? Maybe that catherdral sized cavern once really was a place of worship, dedicated to praising these powerful little things. Maybe people would come there to ask to be blessed by the creature's power... or to appease and beg forgivness from the things they feared that swam in the dark water below, who lived quietly and in solitude, without ever seeing light- and liked it that way.
You cannot comprehend how excited I am for this to become available. I have been looking for a map like this one for years, and I finally have one in the works. Survival oriented, large (huge oh my god), has story, custom building, bro I am ecstatic
As a rail fan myself, I was the most exited for this one!
For the snowy mountainns it would be cool to see a secret like Tibetan prayer area or smth in the mountains. I read a book that had that idea in it and it was really nice. add a giant prayer wheel too cus that would be cool. (you can search about the prayer wheel)
Will this world be available on bedrock
I thought it was Fortnite map for a sec
Microsoft should hire you.
Bro, you should make a Russian orthodox church for another place of worship
best one yet
That saloon looks like the one from Armadillo in Red Dead Redemption!
Not to be rude did you do this already?
I’d love to see Norse mythology/Asgods being worshipped in the taiga or maybe snowy mountains!
YEEEEEEES!!!!!
Can this be downloaded on PS4 or PS5
He's doing a hard work
I'd love to see your take on the Hagia Sophia, or the Helleno-Roman beliefs
U don't know how long I have been waiting for this to come out! This is amazing how u can't get bored really fast. U put your work into it. I honestly would have given up on MC but I haven't because now that I'm watching these it makes my mind explode with ideas of what to build for my SMP. Thank u for helping- AND! Always be AWESOME!
Bro this is literally chronopolis from the Kang comics
Would you be open to making a tutorial on how you create your rock formations like here in the Mesa and in the jungle with world edit? Love the results you get from what you do and would love to learn how to do it
Imma get my friend to open an smp with this
Does this have modded tools and mobs?
https://youtu.be/Iu8ZmhRphSU
So much hardship I really appreciate your work bro, stay safe and God bless everyone❤❤❤😊
through this whole video my favorite part is using red candles to look like individual dynamite sticks
Quite a shame how its not gonna be free ;-;
is there going to be anything for people that cannot access the map and still want to know all the lore and adventures?
For the next biome a sikh gudwara would be cool as a place of worship (a little biased since I am a Sikh myself)
can honestly see the mesa village and the whole area being used as a movie prob, or even used for a series
Looking for viewers to join my adventures! https://youtu.be/wX5FEHx7u94
Will it be on bedrock
imagine he did one of these series but with the biomes o plenty mod 😭 great job on this btw 👍
Dude, you have no idea how talented you are. This is soooo good. I can’t believe you made all this yourself and your not even finished yet. You spent so much time, and it is absolutely perfect. I normally spend like maybe two to three hours working on a build (sometimes more) and then I get unmotivated and stop 😂. You are truly incredible.
Are u going to go to the neather
This is so awesome! It would be cool if you did something similar with the nether biomes (maybe + the enderworld if you feel like it)! It would be interesting, if you did this, to see your transformations (:
Are you the real creator?
Ohh come on we hai cran but not a single lift
:OOOO damnnn this is so nice
This guy's amazing. I can't wait for the world!
Will the use have a bedrock marketplace version
Please put this on the Bedrock Marketplace once you're done, my gf and I have been following since the start of this series and we're in love with it, but both play on Bedrock. Much love for the hard work, keep it up! ❤️
the lore and the size of this world is incredible. Not seen anything like this before.
ah yes 16 million blocks is a small scale 7:10
imagine someone speed running this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7J4jOtCzxs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7J4jOtCzxs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7J4jOtCzxs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7J4jOtCzxs
Finally! I’ve been waiting! Great work!
you should have joined a gym nerd!
Trixy, the snowy moutains is the perfect place for something huge and menacing! Maybe a dragon frozen in ice, but slowly melting… U can take inspiration from the frozen levithian in subnatica below zero maybe. Love this and keep the good work up!!
Pls do snowy tundra next
I've seen so many timber trestle bridges in real life especially through childhood, so seeing them here is a little nostalgic. I was already excited for a western looking town and mines, and seeing you bring it to life with these excellent builds was well worth the wait. Love the detailing as always.
Not to be dissatisfied and all but where are the native Indians and their tipis would be fun if you added that as well
this is SO quality!!!
There's a SMP of this world
Wow
The trains just make me go “yes”
What happened to the stable in the wild west town? Still love your work cant wait to get it.
But what if you don't have money to pay
9:20 tbh i wouldve made the tracks acytually ridable
I’m in bedrock so I’m really excited to see the movie series
Why would their be a shreiff office and a jail if their outlaws
Bro why does it look like the millennium falcon
The train looked like a real train but a bit blocky
I'm LIVING for the wild west town
thanks for the brief history lesson
You forgot to add stable for the horses on the wild west. That's the first thing that came up to my mind when you said wild west
This series so SO good
Who remembers when the first video came out?
*builds that one hypixel murder mystery map*
I genuinely gasped when I saw a new episode had been released. You’re really talented!
This world would be way more awesome  if you added “better Minecraft” mod
Imagine somebody doing an animation on this map based on the storyline that's made with it
I made it to the building process of the Ultimate Survival Worl, Hell yeah! I cant wait for the final product
An idea for the savanna is to have an abandoned hunting station where they would put the animals they killed in
I’m so fricken excited for this to fully come to fruition. I will be playing the shit out of this map when it’s all finished
I swear the last episode he's gonna be like I wanted to add more so there will be a heaven above the whole map and the whole nether will get a rework
https://youtu.be/7d16CpWp-ok
I hope they do the snowy mountains next although it will probably be savannah
For the snowy mountains you should make a huge community dug in the sides of the mountain with ladders leading to other layers of the city
Pls put a temple(hindu worship)in the next one
I love your epic buildings montage
did he really just say other realms?
Idea for the the end (if you do it that is), have a dragon skeleton there because that would be where it had died (I'm really go at story's and it popped into my head)
Alternate Title: Minecraft: The Western Update!
will this map be played in vanilla minecraft or will there be some mods or datapacks?
Hi I know that the railroad is already finished but what I would like to see is a functional railroad using the mod immersive railroads (1.12.2-1.16.5) it has many steam trains carriages etc and if you want to use diesel trains you will need immersive engineering for the fuel but it would be great to see a functional steam train going around the mesa/badlands
https://youtu.be/9cNF1TYC350
A
can u build valhalla
you have to respect the effort and result
he really should make another train falling cause the outlaws blew the bridge up because  there was a military force on it and had some goods like a bank cart
I recommend that you make a religion that’s new for a certain biome also will this be available for bedrock
:)
Will there be a bedrock release
I have a little suggestion. I noticed that you have a thumbnail pattern for this series, but you could put more emphasis on the biome you're building, because people see your video in their feed, and a quick look may make them think they've already seen the video, since both the thumbnail and the title are similar to the other videos.
Why don’t u build the Statue of Liberty in the center of a industrial town
I really like your use of red candles as dynamite sticks.
Put the link pls in Ur vid for the Minecraft world pls hurry for free?... PLS
Are you gonna do this for the nether?
I think theres a need for more houses.....
The snowy mountains or taiga biomes need to be viking themed, with longships, feast halls, alters, etc.
Mojang trying to keep up with this guy like: 😰
I know I would be difficult and take a while but please do the nether and end
a leather worker is called a tanner.
How many back up worlds do you think he has 2 4 5?10?20?
All I can say is: You are the most talented builder the world has ever seen.
Me: god I’m so cold because it’s winter time, oh wait I have an idea! **turns on pc and gets onto this world**  Me: ahhh warm already
Jesus wept
Will the release be on bedrock?
Imagine he used carpenter blocks mod
These are the type of youtubers that remind me what Minecraft is.
Could you add giraffes and other Savanah animals, or statues of them that resemble the old tribes that once lived there? The tribes got fought out of their land by the western people (shortly after the western people got there) who were looking for more land to expand their mines. The tribes fled to the snowy mountains setting up camp and have been living there ever since. The tribes have to pay the villagers that live in the dark oak forest to stay where they are and to prevent war from happening.
HAHA SOMEONE LEAKED ALL UR PATRON CONTENT
Damn
Can we Downoload the map?
I feel like an Asian style village would be a nice touch somewhere
I would love to see an abandoned colony on a coast from a foreign power halfway across the ocean, in similar vein to the lost colony of the outer banks in North Carolina, what ever happened to them no one knows
Bedrock?
Are you going to release this on the Minecraft marketplace for bedrock?
I'm sad that the map isn't free I would join the pateon I just don't have the money
I really wanna see the Pride rock in the savannah
Man, I am so obsessed with this whole project. Keep it up! It looks amazing!
i would love to see a Japanese style of building in the tiaga or the mountains
I had an idea for the snowy mountains, there could be cave systems where towns were built to stay out of the wind
This is definitely my favorite biome yet. Keep up the good work!
I have an idea where you could make an ice spike with igloos in the air because the inhabitants were taunted by some sort of ice monster
I hate to say it, but you can't stop now
This is awesome keep up the good work you’re so talented at building stuff in Minecraft
I find this very satisfiying as im getting a new pc soon
This guys is going to face smash when he realizes The Sandbox will replace minecraft
Before I get to existed I would like to know if this is available on bedrock edition
I'm so excited to play this map. I think this is gonna be the only world I play in that I actually beat the game. I can't wait to see all the hidden little details on top of the immense detail we've already seen in these videos! So hype for the final product 😁 (Also could you please put a Buddhist monk temple on one of the taiga mountains I think that would be pretty sick for one of the religion relation builds lol)
I think you should’ve added a horse stable to the western village. I think that would be very fitting
Very gud
Pls pls pls PLS make this a Minecraft server
Mod and map devs dont get enough credit
I as a neo-pagan will love to see that in the next biome ❤️❤️
the savaana could be based around the aboriginal people of australia
YAYYYY U MADE ANOTHER ONE!!!!
You should also upgrade the end and nether!
absolute legendary drive my guy
6:50 I didn't know steam trains ran on water. thanks for telling me!    (for those of you who can't tell: this is a joke)
it would be cool if you build a village in the mountains
Red dead redemption in minecraft be like
Imagine world edit not existing
YES FINNALY
When this is done can you put it on the minecraft marketplace
Can someone make o mod for this like with  wizards and new villagers
I think it would be cool if like, there was a separate railtrack, with blockage, that had collapsed, due to attacks by outlaws from a near camp (not associated to the main village) and a broken and rusty train on the floor, partially buried
Please Upgrade the Ozean 🙏🙏🙏
this guy deserves more hype the builds are astronomical
WOW, just Wow. over the top and amazing. this is going to be the best experience on minecraft. its so unbelievable thank you so much!
this is truly something special.
this map look amazing to bad I can't play it becuase I don't have patron and I'm poor
'No your breathtaking'
Your building skils are insane
this is slick
I know you probably won’t see this, Trixy, but I have a question: are these areas going to be populated? Will these towns and dungeons have unique monster and NPC spawning behaviors to make them more challenging / full of life, such as Villagers, Pillagers, or monster spawners? So far, this all looks absolutely fantastic, but I am curious as to whether or not there is going to be more gameplay-related stuff in the map for the purpose of satisfying adventuring.
Dude you have to create a modpack for this world
Can you add the lush caves, the deep dark, and an amethyst cluster somewhere
Can you build a big ice cave with a big vikingsship?
I would LOVE it if the map was FREE... Kinda good way to make some money.
You could potentially take some inspiration from dragonspine for the snow mountains area? I feel the large underground caves and ruins could translate really well into minecraft
Savanna’s religion could be a spiritualism hut or something. Please consider I usually don’t get chosen with this stuff:(
Some retextured pillagers for various bad guys would be dope
When you finish your maps you could survive 100 Days In it
is this going to be in 1.18?
Is it on bedrock ?
Here’s a idea: what if in one of the snowy biomes you make a yeti cave (and maybe with some sort of story of why it’s there)
for the mountain biomes u shaould go for a viking villiage , i think that will go with the whole snowy theme .
Anyone know the music at 9:18 ?
For the snowy mountain biome you should build a budist monastery
Could you possibly build an upgraded Minecraft dungeon in one of the next Ultimate Survival World vids? I feel like it doesn't feel appreciated enough and is often forgotten about (Edit: By Minecraft dungeon I mean the small stone rooms with a spawner in the middle)
Tbh i expected a little bit more like some outlaw camps and a stable. But all in all very impressiv
This is just so awesome. I never could built like this, because I just build in survival and try to involve the landscape into my houses. And it all is so big. You are really talented!
A custom biome the floating islands would be cool
We would love a *Hindu temple*
Will u update the nether and the end?
Keep it up! Best world ever!!❤️ SIUUUUUUUUM
The winter area should have an ice castle and an ice dragon, could be kinda cool
Damn imagine if people adding the mods to this world
can it be compatibal with 1.12.2
Is this map gonna be free? And when its gonna be released?
Please transform seamps
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq  Programmierer der Master K. I.
You should do a Mormon temple.
Will the map be avalible on bedrock or pocket?
You should open server on this map it must be cool…
You should make the savanna next and make it a huge older time city.
The next season of third life or hermitcraft should be on this amazing map
Please can you also add an Indian themed building also ..you can take inspiration from some outstanding Mughal builds like the taj Mahal ,red fort (delhi) and hindu builds like the Konark ,etc (u ll find more on internet) please... If not in this project, you can also add that in some other project....
I see an image that the the ultimate survival becoming a game  like having strange creatures and more awesome building blocks I love your builds there really inspiring and keep it up ! :D
How to get this map?
I would like to see an early Christian church or a byzantine church as a place of worship for the next biome... i think that it would actually make both biomes (savanna and mesa) a bit more connected with their beliefs and it would also match the architectural style of the mesa....   We actually just finished discussing about the early Christian architecture and the byzantine architecture just a few days b4 this vid and i just think that this style would match the savanna ...
Sick place dude!!  Nicely done
I forgot if you added an end. And will the nether be customized to?
Awesome job on this build!  It’s is amazing what though and other youtubers do for their viewers. Merry Christmas and have a Happy New Year! 🎆
You nead to make castle on mounteins
I love this map
It’d be cool to add oil rigs
try a mosque
Any way to download this world for free?
A suggestion that you almost certainly are not going to read by I want to say regardless:  There should be four Bastion Remnants in the Nether, as there are four vanilla bastions. The Hoglin Stables bastion should be located in the Crimson Forest, as that is where Hoglins like to spawn. The Bridge bastion could span over the Soul Sand Valley, as Soul fire scares away Piglins, and they would likely want to have a bridge over the biome, rather than just a path through it. The Treasure Bastion could be placed in the Nether Wastes, as that bastion type has lots of gold, and the Wastes have lots of exposed gold in them. And the housing unit would just go in the Warped Forest through process of elimination (Bastions don't appear in Basalt Deltas).  Thank you for watching my TED-Ed video.
Le mao this wont hit 250k likes F
How cool coud it be when Minecraft use this Buildings to generate worlds 🤯
you for got the nether
Every time I see your builds I'm just in awe all over again at the sort of things you make. This feels like something made by a team of dozens, not just two. It's jaw-dropping.
Is it downloadable on Bedrock Edition?
Damn only 113k likes 😞
I remember watching the first episode. Now i see how big this project is!
"wait until you play the map"  my very old PC: oh no pls pls don't it will exploded it isn't worth it   me: **evil laugh**
I really appreciate the research you've done for this episode! Even as an Old West history buff I learned something new!
Love it
Oh I can't wait for other YouTubers to play on this
Dude, I am more hype for this then for GTA VI
You should make a village that's destroyed and in ruin, instead of everything being in pristine condition, despite being abandoned. It could add some wear and tear and a feeling that the place is indeed abandoned, and not just that everyone's gone on holiday for a bit. Just a general idea, and most of the stuff in these are described by you as being ancient and abandoned, but not many of them look that way. Also, I think it would just look pretty cool. Just an idea, you don't have to incorporate it, but it would look really good.
oml. this. is. AMAZING.
Can we please get a Greek or Roman biome? Maya would also be cool
I've liked every single thing you did in this build so far, but in this video there is one thing I didn't like. It's the part where the supports for the bridge meets the mountain... Shouldn't that be a half arch for saving valuable resources? It seems like so much wasted wood.
You can tell this guy is a Minecraft veteran cause he calls it Mesa and not Badlands
You should connect the mine cart track to the jungle mine, would make it a fun and fast way of getting there
I can’t wait to play on this server when it’s finished!! Keep up the great work TrixyBlox!!
You can try to find a good command block creator to make the decorations work.
U know what I would definitely use this for some kind of modpack this world is insane since it also adds quests by itself it will make it a lot more fun.
Imagine spending 100 days in this
Awsome
Imagine making this in survival
I’m not gonna watch the movie because I don’t want any spoilers. The only time I might watch it is when I’m playing the map and are lost.
So im just gonna point out that this island looks like a among us character 😂😂
When will this map be done?
I know it's not an actual biome but could you possibly include a custom volcano biome to explore too?
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SINCE MONTH YEAASS
Why not make it like a dungeons and dragons game puts some mods jn there put ancient armor,sword and stuffs
So can't wait for this
YOOO WEE NEED 250K LIKES
I hope this world is free on Bedrock as well PLEEEAAASE!!
imagine the church was literally just the saloon
He could add islands as dlc xD
Hope you dont mind, but when the map comes out, I WILL PLAY IT ON MODDED MINECRAFT (Valhelsia 3 modpack to be precise) just because i wanna make your cranes, trains, and other carts actually moveable :)))

the next video should have a watering hole
A Budda like Statue in the snowy Mountains and a Nepal like city
24 hours out and 110k likes, damn
for the snowy mountains make it norse or viking themed
Amazing video Trixy! In case it wasn't already decided, I have an idea of who the gang of outlaws might be. Perhaps the Wild Bunch? Led by Butch Cassidy. He's one of my inspirations and is an interesting character. It'd be nice to incorporate real life outlaws in the survival world
2022 encyclopedia definition of the phrase “worth the wait” is going to be this insane map
i really want to see an Aether sky island floating above the ocean somewhere and you can find its location somewhere special
Definitely thought it would be free 😕
Omg do you know what you should do... The nether anyway love your videos
how much long will it take?
Love your vids and i like how you upload often keep it up please comment on this comment that will make my day
I love how educational this video is!
This bridge looks incredible
dude ur work is amazing, but ur bri'ish
Can we have a nether one?
You should make a temple for the savannah!
if this map would be in the minecraft marketplace that would be amazing because  i play minecraft on mobile😞
How do you get this map?
you have done great again
wish these were 30 minutes long...
TRIXYBLOX I have a Challenge for you. Could YOU remake stampy’s lovely world.
Words cannot describe how amazing everything is. The worldbuilding and builds are all phenominal.
How van u play it
what is the terraforming done with? I had mc edit and painter but they only work for older minecraft versions.
so the map wont be free right?
Please take me seriously, because I cop a lot of shit for my religion, but I would love to see some representation of satanic places of worship, thanks🙏💜
I've waited so long for this
minecraft wasnt meant to be that cool
Made us wait for so long and then bring out a 15 min video could have made it longer but either way it’s awesome
Think I would've liked some shots of down low in the tow going down those shootout- esque streets
The thumb nail is sus, i just came here to say that
Should’ve built an small camp of outlaws hidden out next to the track ready to blow the track and rob the train!
hallo and welcome to "My PC And internett argued for 18 and a half hours"
I need another episode and I need to play this Minecraft world.
I bet this will become a goddamn NFT
I think you should have a couple ranches and/or houses that are a bit farther away from the main town. The town seems a bit small but if that's what you were going for then it's fine. Other than this, I think you did a good job. Keep up the good work.
Chruch for wicked
floating sky islands? and small swamp? Uros island in Lake Titicaca
Add little bandit camps
im going to ask for permision from you blox but can i plz use this world once its done in a hard core series on youtube i would give credit im just asking for permision
Will this be on console at all?
An update like this in the mesa, like the caves and cliffs update, would be ridiculously sick
yessssssssssssssssss
YES ITS ALMOST HERE LES GO
Madd
this is the most beautiful of all, but the rest is also
Is their a bedrock link for this map, it looks fire :D
For snowy mountains or snowy biome or whatever it is can you make a buddhist temple as the place of worship
Maybe a fox shrine for taiga, I like foxes
Looks awesome but plz redesign the mushroom biome I feel like it has way more potential than what it is now
I know that not just me would spend GOOD money to put this on the bedrock marketplace Love How its coming together   Puts a smile on my face
theres gonna be a stable right
Is this something that would be possible to play on xbox by chance
I love your vids
For the mountains, I would love to see an  snowed in trappers cabin! It could even be almost hidden in snowdrifts.
will we having to pay to play on the map?
sad i wont be able to play considering im not old enough for buying the patreon
This is massively mesemerizing! and could be the other way, mesmerizingly massive!
Nether!
More
I'd love to see a castle in this world
4:20 sussy baka
Will you upgrade the nether
For the snowy biome It would be cool to see a Japanese inspired village with cherry blossoms
hey Oscar, maybe for the snowy mountains you can design a build for the mysterious creature lurking through the mountains, and they could pop up every once in a while to give everyone a good scare
Being Native American and a really huge fan of your channel it makes me happy that you will be implementing use in your build. We tend to get thrown under the bus when it comes to westerners. So I thank you for that! Can’t wait to see how this all unfolds
I like to see an ocean monument and ocean ruins upgrade
This looks amazing and I just discovered the channel😁😁😁
Stables in the town
Could you build a Witcher like castle in the snowy mountains?
YYEEEEES this is everything i could have hoped for!!!!! i cant wait to ride in on a horsey
Gourgues
Lots of ads on this video...
definitely the coolest one yet
You should put a train that derailed or got robbed or something
Try to make a Indian temple style worship place .
I have some questions so will you manually add ores so like diamonds like not in cave systems? will this be 1.18? if its not done by 1.19 would you add another biome for the mangrove forest? will you modify the stronghold? would you add 3 strongholds like normal worlds? well you modify the end/nether? if you did modify the nether would you modify the nether biomes? aswell as the end would you modify the end citys? im ranting, good luck with your project!
DO a map in terraria
This is amazing as always but you should take a small chunk of nether around the portal and remake the nether fortress and batiton
Love   your work
Is there going to be mods when we get to play the map??
i wonder if my computer can even load this world to play on
Aaaaa I cant wait a release.You deserve a own game
build a mousque
Can you please make middleearth as your next project that would be so nice
can it be a free download?
pls make an indian temple
Build a white marble Hindu temple
Can we play on mobile🤔🤔 That will be cool⭐
Hindu Temple maybe?
What shaders would you recommend using when this comes out?
I was honestly thinking of this video, and next thing it was released. Loved the video.
will i be able to run this on my 8gm ram laptop ;-;
I dont know if it fits but I’d like an buddhist or an hindu temple.
great video, although I would prefer a low-profile railroad
Please include a temple in the next vid as a religious building
i like how the litle character looks like a cerser going around the  screen
when you release this I WILL PAY MONEY I NEED THIS ON BEDROCK
i love the railroad bridges they look so sick
Pac-Man lol
Somebody know if he will update the underground of this world too?
The giant island with the mini island looks like Pac-Man eating a pellet XD
oh you finally finished it ! congrats
Add a hindu temple it will be amazing
He is a cRAzY iN miNecRAfT
Watch your train boilers kids. Boiler explosions aren't any fun! 😋
The only thing stopping me from doing something like this is the fact that NO ONE will EVER see it...
I really think you're doing a fantastic job at this world I'm been watching every single one as much as possible and the story you're going the story line that you're going work is very creative
Can we just appreciate this for 5 minutes
(Me wenn i See a mob in minecradt) I like u cut g
no stable?????
@TrixyBlox I am in awe every time I see these videos, you are just so good at building
Imagine leaving the island and discover that he also change the outside world.
I know you haven't done the snowy mountains yet but something that popped into my mind straight away was the mines of moria from lord of the rings and the story could be that used to be a mine for the villages of the snow as the mines were eventually overrun by monsters leaving the mines in ruin for millennia
It's just stunning me.
I really hope this map becomes free at some point. My parents don’t let me use Patreon or any other thing that requires payment other than the MS Store, so I won’t be able to play this until it becomes free
@wadzee kinda looking forward to seeing you play in this world tbh hahaha
a viking related taiga might be dope
Guys wait... He's gonna transform the fricking Nether and the Whole fricking End.
you and steph are such a power couple
Hello, Fallout New Vegas
i love how he has 2 mil subs and he still sets an easy like goal it really makes him seem humble
I really hope you dont have to pay to play this this seems way too cool to not be allwoed for everyone
Please do jungle next please!!!!
do the neather and end
I can’t play I play bedrock
Chad
Nice
I think something like Angkor Wat would be a great worshipping place
U can add temples
Yoooo 11 on Trending!
OH MY GOD IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates -- 🎈
We'd be great to include a ghost town or something like that h3h3
Is it still survival friendly since you put custom heads on the cacti 🌵
gghku
you should include a castle for the snowy mountains
can u like actually put measurements please?
In  Germane usw. means ,,und so weiter‘‘ (and so on)
I wish it was gonna be free not cost money 😭
Can you download it on PlayStation? I really want to play it
i want it to be free
this was the first video i saw about you building this and you know what, im not gonna watch any more, i want to be suprised with the end of it and also very nice job making this
For the mountains you should make the place of worship wherever monks go to worship and for the taiga you should make the place of worship as of the vikings
You should make the end very futuristic
You just got beaned
Oh my god it’s happening, he’s back! Stay calm!
Youre the best i ve eveeer seen
Great work👏
That looks beautiful my guy, GREAT JOB!!!!
Its amazing though i got a question, did you scatter ores (coal, gold, emerald, etc.) all around the island?, its survival so players tend to mine everywhere...
uhhhhh i really want to play this!!!! >.<

Do you think you could port it to bedrock when its finished?
If you done your own map play it by your self and it will be awesome.
This has gotta be my favorite one so far. Also, hearing U.S.W. just makes me feel like it’s saying United States West as a classic callback to the actual Wild West of the USA. Serious Nevada, Arizona, and eastern California vibes.
Forgot one thing horse farm
Yesss I have beeen waiting for ever!
This gona be the best survival map in minecraft hisotry
Pov you play minecraft on seteroids
Dude number nine on trending
I just love your videos of Minecraft and you inspire me of playing Minecraft ❤️
I suggest a Hindu mountain of Lord Shiva in the snowy mountains
the fact that these videos take such a long time to make really shows how much effort goes into these incredible videos, bravo 👏🏻!!
A future city
imagine playing this with rtx in vr...
Pls can you somehow put it on bedrock?
Unñjn is like
Uploadnya ampe 1/2 bulanan astaga
I have seen this before the video released
Make an oil tower
You should make it a motel instead of hotel.
Will it be free to download
Iv
You deserve more subscribers than dream. The hardwork you do is insane.
Dude how can you dow this.
i was thinking this world would be amazing for exploration but why not add a few challenges we all know minecraft dungeons are just a small box with one spawner and takes 2 seconds to clear so why not add some MASSIVE dungeons with multiple hidden spawners to make the world more challenging
Can't wait to explore and find easter eggs!
please add some ruined village..
You should change the hotel to an inn they are the same but in those times they didn’t have hotels
You inspire me to build again! Even though i use PE..
you’re such a sellout
Me downloads the map :my computer adios
Incredible!
What rank do you have to be to get this
Hello trixyblox, your constructions are the best and I would like to know if we can download it as much as for bedrock and java
Congrats! You're also early and found this comment
the vibe is bland
for the taiga build a viking themed village, that could be pretty cool !
Your PC might as well be Goku
yeah this is cool, but will it beat my epic diamond block house LOL
since the savanna is gonna be inhabited by indians, maybe some sort of altar or sacrificing place instead of a church?
I is it for bedrock
I wanna play this world so badly!
The Wild West needs a horse stable and some horses!!
please when you releas this world make it free please I beg youu I want to play with my friends on it
I've been waiting yeas month weeks to see this finally
Minecraft version?
Wano.
Minecraft Redemption 2
I´m honestly shocked over how amazing this looks! I cant wait to play it and explore all the biomes <3 It kind of reminds me of Blackwater in Red Dead Redemption 2!
Something I recommend is an  ancient warzone somewhere in the map
Red Dead Redemption vibes like sheeeessshhh
Very good man!but I wonder..why don't you add like dead bushes and dead tree?idk if it's sounds crazy but it's just a suggestion :)
LUSH CAVE :) if to hard don't do it :) It's your opinion
This made me think of RDR2 and 'The Legend Of Zorro'
HES BACK
Terraform the Nether too xD
you have lots of patience to do this compared to me. i'd quit in like 10 minutes
my man this is crazy amazing effort keep it up!
Hire people don’t try to do everything by yourself use your idea but use other people to make it or use others ideas as well
This man needs to be one of the head builders on wynncraft
Please make it available on tlauncher I'm poor as you can see and because I want to play Minecraft as a sheriff I would like to play on your map and so please make it available on key launcher and if you don't I respect that because it's probably not easy or you were too lazy like me
The map is top three I have seen it’s even 1# it looks so good you are a a great builder
I always enjoy every second of this, you are so skilled in building and I love that u share those beautiful builds with us. I really enjoy this series so keep on goin, u make my day in this lockdown❤️
please make it free
This is insane I thought that server maps were crazy but THIS is insane
its a shame you have to pay for this
do you upgrade stornhold in USW (ULTIMATE Survival World!)
Been waiting so long for this!!!!!
Are you sure it’s legal to be this good at building?!?!?!
Wow you a such talented in creating  landscape... You should work in landscape architect... If you show this in your interview, they will definitely take you
finally
Every time I see one of these amazing vids all I can think is what if there was someone that could help add in a custom data pack with tools weapons and so much more to fit the styles of the biomes. Love the vids and always makes me think of my own ideas for what could happen in this awe inspiring world
This dude blesses us at the most RANDOM times ever. I love it!
I really hope that someone will convert this map to bedrock edition:'(. Sometimes it's just not really fair that java edition have better maps,mods,plugins,seeds, compare to bedrock edition 😥.
i  respect you
LOVE THIS SERIES KEEP IT UP
I can't wait to play it! btw I love your vids and I'm subscribed.
Maybe a Mormon temple for the savanna biome?
In the taiga i need a iglu village and an underground temple
there aren't cemetery
please make avilable this for minecraft pe
You should make a floating island too
Already #9 on trending.
But what happens if we don't reach the 250,000 likes. would he just stop working.🤔
Amazing.. Just amazing..
This series alone gained him 1 mil subs
In the taiga or snowy mountains biom u should make a stav church
Mohjang take notes.
C’mon guys 250k likes! We only have 100k
Plz I want to play plz give the link
he is EXHAUSTED,  can tell from the first 10 second this man is the best of the best
build an indian temple
Vikings are cool for the Arctic
Hey can you transform nether and end too?
Both of yous are sooo hardworking, so thank you soo much for your creativity building and storytelling. and the addition of different religious building and their background. These videos deserve sooo much more views and I hope yous are getting payed well.
I'd like it if the pillars in the end were redesigned to better encompass their importance in that realm
Sow cool man
I really want to see the mountains
You forgot the public execution area in the wild west hehe
will u sell this map?
next in the savanah you should add some boat's out on the sea
This is a real minecraft world to be play on survival
this would go very well with a mod that adds a bunch of stuff like items and stuff for each biome
Epppppp
Please, how can i join this world?
how about a Tempel plaza as a place of worship, like the anciend romans or greacs had...
I'm a big fan of the Western period and I was SO jittery the whole time!!!!! This got me so excited for the map!
Shit, his design is TB.       *I've always wanted teberbculosis on my phone case!*
In savanah make autumn style village
You should also do nether and end, since they are a big part of survival
Such an amazing job. Are you going to rework some parts of the nether and the end?
i can not wait to play this map
What an absolute insane project! Can't wait to divulge in this world. You are nothing less than an artist! Also fun fact: usw is a german acronym for "und so weiter" which means "and so forth"
Now make a tutorial on how to make this block by block.
I have only one question will you add this on mobile?
what about the 1.18 update, are you going to change something in the world?
nice video
You can say whatever you want , this man is a legend
This is sick😳
this geezer should be on hermitcraft no cap
You deserve to be in HC ngl
if u can please incorporate a indian temple in the map pls
I definitely adding create so i can build a functioning train on that rail road
Bro I wanna use a Elytra in this place! Looks so fun!
As a separate project once the map is done, I think we should all get a team of great builders and expand it beyond the one island, surrounding it by others and making many colonies to then bring into the lore as well
For one of the mountain biomes, i would really like to see a giant ravine and buildings/houses in the walls of the ravine. U could also make them hanging upside down like the temples in Avatar - the last airbender
i cant get the map cuz me on mobile so pls make a tour and im from phillipines and im obsessed with ur builds so im tryna make myself one and pls make a tour vid on that when its finish since i cant get the map i dont think so tho
I personally as places of worship, temples work pretty well and are easy to individualise for every biome. U could gor example build a lion statue/temple in the mesa or polar bears/wolfes as gods to worship in the colder biomes. :) Great project btw, pls keep up the work! Cant wait to play the map!
Damn, that's AMAZING! the dedication to the placement of every single block is mind-blowing. For the next biome in the savanna, i'd like to see a Gujrati culture (from Gujarat, India) with the temples and their buildings. Would like to see your interpretation and replication.
That island kinda sussy boi
Mosque in the next video
hey why don't you put a safari for the savanna
This is just amazing - really in awe of the time and detail you put into this. One question: are there any possibilities that i can play this together with my friends? Like, incorp. this into a server?
You're a genius
i just CANT wait to play the map!!!
8:24 you shouldve made the 2nd station look more abandoned and made a ghost town next to it
Temple in next biome
This world with mods and a bunch of friends and some role play would be soo funny
What shader do you use?
You sould add a custom soundtrack to each biome it would really add to the atmosphere.
god buddha temple
"the water tower was used to supply water"
Do we have to be on patron to play on it?
3:39 - In the old west, a leatherworker would have been, along with the blacksmith's, at the local stable .  His business would've been called the saddlery, where he sold saddles and tack (leather harnesses, straps, et cetera). 3:58 - Everyone knows the jail is in the back of the Sheriff's office.  Otherwise, how are the sheriff and deputy/deputies supposed to keep an eye on the prisoners? 5:29 - You forgot the school.  The schoolteacher would have to live somewhere other than the school. You also forgot the doctor's office, the general store, the feed and grain store (likely near the stable), the assayer's office (since there WILL be miners in the area), and the post office. 10:18 - Buildings on stilts such as that would have been massively impractical and, as far as I know, it was NEVER done.  Nor were cranes.  Ore was packed onto mules and "mule trains" walked up narrow trails, if it needed to be brought out of canyons.
The snow biome 100% needs a nordic religion or slavic pagan religion
This series is incredible. TB is on a whole other level! 💯
Mom I want Red dead redemption 2. Mom: We have Red dead redemption 2 at home.  Red dead redemption 2 at home:
Imagine using shaders playing this
They would be amazing movie directors tho
11:15 is that’s a bunch of blocks dancing
Wow, what a cool idea
YES lets go my absolute favorite biome
Very korll - Barry the Cod
Today is my birthday
Man this would be really cool for RP servers
will there be underworld kingdom in this map?
LIKE THEY VIDEOOOO!!!!
You Are The Best!!!!!!! I Admire You
I Luv this series!!
This would be amazing with the Immersive railroading mod
Ibedrock compatible with this world
make a temple in the next biome
This man is dedicated
Which shaders are u using?
I can almost imagine somewhere in the distance, a man can be heard screaming "LENNAAAAYYY!!!"
You, my friend, are a living legend.
Number 8 on trending, well done.
Make ship wrecks,cargo ships,yahts etc.
So amazing maybe if you were to team up with modders you could add custom mobs
We need Hindu religion in Savana please
it would be so amazing to see other YouTubers explore this map and in a way it could help encourage players to support ur Patreon to get their own copy
I may have to wait for my own PC or to legitimately buy minecraft to play this, but I already love what I imagined walking on that railroad after a lomg journey to get to the mesa village.
Epic.
I hope there are (new) mobs
You are builder LVL Infinity !!!
My boi Jason did it first
Please make hindu temples
OMG
You forgot a horse table for the cow boys
It would be good if you did a temple associated with hindus in the mountains and maybe a monastery (that's ur choice.) Anyway love ur vids and mainly this series Trixy, hope you continue to do these stuff
How did caves and cliff part two affect development of the island
I can't express how impressed I am by this project
Men your builds and you survival world is amazing to explore! Greetings from the Philippines!
DUDE YOUR BUILDS BE AMAZING
i need this map
RLcraft would be real cool with this map
maybe in the snowy biomes, you should make the buildings like ancient japanese buildings as the red that is found in the architecture will complement the white snow nicely
Make a track in the mountains from the mesa on ice so it looks like the poler express scene
Amongus Dies 2 https://youtu.be/dqfGWwNSF_8
Plz make This Faster I Want To Play This map hehe😅
Plz make This Faster I Want To Play This map hehe😅
THIS IS AMAZING!!! Continue with the good work mate :DDD
Can I download for free somewhere?
By the way pls make a bedrock version of this i would love to play with my friend
For snow biomes make Vikings
What do you do to the nether and the end
A little bit terraforming
Its missing Tipi remains
I lost my job during this pandemic and decided to start a channel to 8 others strong. Wish me well..❤️
I lost my job during this pandemic and decided to start a channel to 8 others strong. Wish me well..❤️
A fortress on top of the snowy mountains might be a good idea as it would be easy to defend and hard to attack. Problem is supplies so maybe a trade route through the taiga
This made me want to go play red dead redemption 2
Every masterpiece: USW has its cheap copy: minecraft 1.18
Is there any other way to download the world without patreon because I can't access it
Wait just for my curiosity can anyone tell me how big is 16million blocks in minecraft  compared to the earth?
I really like you’re work!💪🏻 But please stop the like goal cause it bullshit. You’ll make the next one anyway cause it’s the way you’re earning your money. So just cut the crap
from where we can get this map
I cannot wait to play on this world honestly! surely!
Will you do something to the Nether too? of course you can't do just like an nether Island or something like that, but you could go where ypu come out if you ho through the ruined portal and build like an piglin city or something like that
Is the 1.18 update in the world like the underground world??
These builds sure take time. Nice work 👍
Imagine building all this in survival
Am I the only one who got borderlands feels with this?
I think you should transform the taiga biome next, and maybe even include a taller forest as part of it just like regular minecraft!
is this going to cost money to download?
are you going to remake parts of the caves and underground?
What do u use to make the map
How about, place of worship wise, how about instead of a church-like building built for that purpose, it was a sacred pilgrim site
I feel like you should have done also a working train station, with minecarts
Hey , what about using command blocks? For example , mines like World of Warcraft with spawnable ore by couldown. (Sorry for my English)
Via is pronounced vee-a
cant wait to play this!
I won’t be downloading it but damned if these videos don’t deserve a like
I really love this Series and all your content but for personal reasons I can’t donate is there a way I can play the map without donating?
Please do snowy mountains plzzzzzz
this screamed red dead redemption 2 to me and i honestly* love it!!!
Amazing job !! Can you put some of your creations, as the underwater city in this USW map ? It ll be awesome to have the ocean to explore, as the ocean is also a biome ! And will you modify the Nether / The End ? With this huge mesmerizing map, going to the Nether with classic structures will taste small and ugly 😂. Love your work you and Steph. Support from France !
remeber to back the world up every 5 minutes
I have a question can you play this on bedrock or pocket edition?
He really building 2050 Minecraft in 2021
Also transform nather
It's amazing
Brits sure gear towards the EASY MONEY route don't they?
This is so well made!
now we need caves :)
He should get an award for this lol
This is unbelievable
Me on bedrock 😩
The tribes you said could be native indians so an indian temple pleaseee!!
Dude youre enviroment design skills is so insane! I see the result and it's blowing my mind. But also i see hard work behind it. Youre doing great, keep it up! Let 2022 be more interesting! 💚😱👍
You could make a furnace, crafting, and storage either inside the mine or on one of the platforms on the outside that’d be nice. These videos are always crazy to me how much detail you put into them 🤯
I dont have money so I think I can download and play this map in mid 2022 - 2023
You forgot the livery stable
Pls pls make it free pls i am bagging you pls make it free plss pls.
Beautiful. My one suggestion to this biome would be a cattle ranch to support the leather business and to give the cowboys something to do
i got a vr set and i cant wait to play this map on vr when its 100% done
when will your next video be
I got banned from your dicord for refusing to change my name. Apparently liking communisim is bad in your discord
Are you gonna do some caves builds ? (because honestly if you do it, it's gonna be so f*ck*ng cool :) )
i feel like there should be some sort of abyss in the ocean  it would be like some sort of giant hole that gets into bedrock and it would have it's own loot and stuff like that
Would you also customise giant caves from the recent updates?
This guy deserves 100 million subscribers  he spends hundreds of hours building on Minecraft
Pogers Shit its patreon exlusive fuck im fucking poor and a kid i cant buy that but still cool
Dude amazing how do you do this and what is this servers link I want it now
damn
:( i cant download it cuz i can't join your patreon
Are you giving this world free for bedrock edition
Hype or pump up for this world
this guys built different
Where does the train stop at the mines?
Can wait to play this world
Where’s the stable for the horses do they just stand there forever?
I was wondering if you could play the map on bedrock?
This is epic but i think it reminds me of the dungeons, strongholds, the end and the end city could you upgrade them too?
Pls consider building your next worship place with indian architecture 🙏
@mojang hired this guy
I LIKE TRAINS SO I LIKE THE MESA
I am absolutly speechless...
The railroad should connect to neighboring biome, the lore would be that those 2 biomes had good relations that they built a railroad to connect them to make trade faster
Come on guys look at this skill get this man some likes
What engine you use?
It might just be the inner train nerd within me, but this is genuinely your most epic one yet.
i am mind blown how amazing your ability is to make these biomes
So small
Will this be available on Bedrock too?
A volcano would be impressive in this Planet
I have no words to describe so much patience and skill
Please
Can have the severe
I wish i could have his creativity and determination. Truly amazing
We want a stable 🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐴🐎🐎🐴🐎🐴🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  Like
Its been a loonnggg timee .....
you should make the train move.
I have no idea who you are but this series is interesting
Can you make the map able to be played on pocket edition
As a suggestion, you could've added stables in the Mesa biome as horses are often used in the Wild West.
The mines remind me of Ravenholm in Half Life 2
Cool.
Maybye a massive totem pole for the savannah?
Wowee, you did amazing!Keep going!
😍😍
Already at 91k likes
Trixy i have an idea that u could do! I think that you should add secrets in the well in the town of wild west
viking village and odin praying longhouse can be a good idea for snowy mountains.
I have waiting too long for this and it worthy
I really love this project
I am 100% using some of your crane designs in my hardcore survival world
POV: You think Grian is the best builder
Imagine this with factions though
i am deffinetly buying this when its done
Where can I get this 😭😭😭😭
Just imagine if he used the Create Mod... HE CAN MAKE MOVING TRAINS
Thank you so much for another fabulous video! Building is my favourite thing to do in Minecraft, and you've really giving me motivation to keep building! One of my favourite things when I play video-games such as The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild is to find secret, hidden details/lore because it's really satisfying when you figure out a secret storyline. I can't wait to play this magnificent world!
Simply amazing!
Realy why do we need to pay just to get a minwcraft world like buying minecraft it self is not expensive
Your building is amazing I am horrible when coming to creative housing in minecraft
Why is such a great map be own by a greedy guy
Please make a gurudwara religious places for worshiping for Sikhs
Me first
This world is going to be the very definition of, 'worth the wait.'
I waited this for too long ❣️
Mate, you forgot to add a stable in the Wild West, i'm pretty sure horses have a big connection to the Wild West.
Just I say nice
Ok THIS IS COOL But I have one question....... what will you do when your subcribers (like me) don't have patreon to download the finished map and is the map compatible with bedrock and pocket edition? Just asking ;>
Omg You are a absolute LEGEND
You could make a favela in mesa style
something pagan related would be cool place of worship in the taiga
Your progress is really slow, maybe… pick up the pace?
Will there be caves under the world?
It's great that a massive project such as this one is being done. Keep up the good work!
That so amazingggggggg you are so cool i waiting PART 6❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The train is sooo good
Oh la la it's so beautiful!🤩
This is just amazing you are the number 1 minecraft builder you work so hard for your fans if you die you will be known as the best of building god master
Liken
it looks amazing so good
Will there be a bedrock release?
I live 1 town over from a western town and that's pretty accurate   (I am just calling that but it's a whole town with real old west buildings and the people their try and keep the history of the town alive since it was a major player in the california gold rush era)
I have been waiting for this for SO SO long! I want to download this world so much XD!
🤌
I will be a cool idea with a bunch of hidden islands covered by a large mountains in between a vally(all in a large island in far off ocean for a secret.)
5:28  “I wonder who lives here”  The names…   *Rango*
I cant wait to play on this world!!
can We Get The Download In Bedrock??
It will be really cool for a archipelago (bunch of tropical islands)with a multi island pirate base and some treasure hunts
Can ice mountains have mammoths or remains of mammoths
I think you should add a meadows mountain/hill in the plains centre. It would be perfect for players to build castles on!!!
Will you add an ice castle and frozen a snow city with underground dungeon(with maze)as in the cold underground city is the best.
Will this map be free to Download because this work is so great i'd really enjoy playing on this map.
I would honestly enjoy a modded version of this world with lets say working trains and more decoration blocks maybe story implementations and so on.
Would love to see some Viking buildings in the taiga/snowy mountains biome!
Can i play this on bedrock version
For anyone who plays RDR2, This kinda looks like  Valentine right?
The railway and bridge are amazing 😍
you should make it an online roleplay server or smp
I- I LOVE IT!!!
Holy crap this man is an absolute LEGEND! I cannot wait to play this map and dig up all of its secrets and side quests!
After the design is done pls make custom mobs for the story it will be epic
Please build a mundir in next wideo 😆😆😆
Kinda feels like rdr2
Will this be available on consoles?
Holly shieeeett.. good job matey!
you should make a datapack that makes your world generate like that
Rip MCPE in phone 😅
Does anyone know if He's gonna upgrade the nether and end?
I would like to see a indian temple i visited india once the old temples were quite large and beautiful
Laterally he is a god builder in minecraft history 😯😯😧😨😨😧😧
Don't make it only for members make it free for all so all can play this wonderful map.please
For one of the cold places you could do a accurate nordic village.
if minecraft is like this they get 10 trillion views much early
I just have one question... what about the caves? Will you change something or they'll stay the same? (Maybe he already changed them and I don't remember)
I have to ask, why is your skin Robin?
Minecraft Official 1.18.20 Latest Version. https://youtu.be/Rou9UYZ79pY
Could you make a tutorial for the Jaguar statues in the jungle?
As always this came out absolutely amazing. You best bet you’ll be seeing my name on your Patreon subscriber list when this map is released (sadly not sooner tho I’m broke af)
A shinto temple would be nice to see.  Maybe a Buddhist one?
This guy has the most helpful and understanding girlfriend in the whole world. We're can I get a girlfriend like that😂.
Finally
I Love your videos
So RDR3 comes out in 2022. Nice!
Trixiblocks work over 100 hours to make a 14 min video
Do something for idegenous people (I don't really know what they have for believing places) ^^
when is the seed COMING OUT
Nice transformation! I could never do that well. But one small detail, how do the workers/villagers get their food? They can’t just eat wheat and hay blocks right? So I think add a bakery in another build which is the island main source of bread and pies. Thanks and I hope you add this!
You should add some kind of temple or place of worship in the mountains that represent buddhism or hinduism!
Dude if we ad mods to this like the tech guns mod most people will flock to the wild west to have a duel
can you build a mosque?
you should add a ruined town just a small wooden one the broken/abandon
We need to force WadZee to play this world once it’s done
what about caves ??
next will be snow biome
Can’t wait for the final map. I imagine going over the entire map using the “Create”-mod to make everything come to life: windmills, moving trains, etc.
These builds for this world are so amazing! Patiently waiting for each episode to come out. I honestly cannot wait to play this world myself!
when this comes out will the be able to download to bedrock to??????
no one compares to this guy
Can you ad in fans and other mods🙂
I REALLY WANNA SEE HIM JOIN HERMITCRAFT WHOS WITH ME!!! JOIN HERMITCRAFT!
If I remember correctly, old western churches were also the schools during the weekdays/work hours
Oh Boi, congrats!
why is the train network just in this biome? i'd love to see it reaching other parts of the world. you could also include train pirates raiding nearby villages in the storyline, and maybe also more track splits.. but great video again anyway, can't wait to play the map!!
I'm honestly very tempted to make a patreon account just so I can donate toward this amazing build!
i really hope this is free i wanna play this
You need to build a real prison in a canyon, would look awesome. :)
I get that you wanted to give us one more video in 2021, I just think it wojld have been better to not split them up and not give us a video in 2021
yee haw
You should make a giant mountain in the snow biom, that would be awesome!
I know this is epic but how much time would it take to run there in survival  like its 16,000,000 blocks          ⚠️not a hate comment I love your content ⚠️
The music in background really helps to set the mood
This is magnefique
I waited soo long for this
of that worpd upgrade nether and end dimension toooooo
He'll yeah I love mesa bioms!!!
YouTube should pay double for this man great work
Definitely my favourite biome so far
I AM SO FREAKING HAPPY THAT ANOTHER ONE HAS CAME OUT LESSSSGO!!!. I can't wait until its out to play it!
How about a stave church?
Imagine making a pay to play map its even worse than pay 2 win.
Will there be natural spawns? (ores, geodes etc.)
Add the new biome
There should be a mode in Minecraft  Where you can't break specific blocks, or structures You can only mine what is available to mine And place blocks where it's needed
Can you build a pagoda in the next biome?
ah yes. the United States of Wisconsin
This looks so cool i cannot wait to play it and btw i will by a T-shirt with new design for Christmas.
IBE BEEN WAITING SOOOO LONGGGG YEAHHHHHH
dude make ice biom
Horse stables for the wild west
Can u please use the design of a hindu buddhist temple for the snow biome as it would looks austere and perfect for the background :) love ur videos.....
I so hyped to play on this amazing map
daaaaaaamn
How will I be able to donwloadthe world to xbox one? Somebody PLS help cause im terrible at this I know I have to pay n patreon but WHAT then???? Pls help Lls Pls Pls
One place of worship for the mountains could be an budhist temple.Great video.
Damnnnn this is on another level 🔥
for the savanna i would love to ee a raveen
Would be cool if the rail road spanded across all of the map
16000000??? that’s a little excessive no? how is one supposed to go from one end to the other let alone all over the map
I wish i didn't watch the previous vids so I could binge watch them all at once. This inspires me! Great job!
i cant download so how to download for phone
Dude imagine if someone makes a mod that enchances this even more with rpg elements and proper civilisations and their respective inhabitants!
I'm so sad I can't play this!!! 😢
IM SO EXITED TO PLAY ON THIS WORLD!!
Make a toboggan run for the snow Mountains
Can you make in snowy mountains a cave
Do the mountain next
add underground statue
Maybe you could make a pagan temple in the taiga.
Ye dek k KGF Ka map Bana ne Ka maan Kar Rha h but it is not possible 🤔🤩😭
Norse Mythology for the snowy mountains!!!
Maybe its a stupid question, but shouldn't there be a townhall in every of your villages? It kind of feels odd without
This is my favourite redesign so far
not only java plzz do phone
The crypto currency market is a vast market for everyone to make a livelihood from, the economy of the world is about a great depression which will leave billionaire of people working 9-5 jobless, penniless and frustrated; only the wise will make it out alive, when I say the wise I mean people who invested wisely into crypto currency. I lost my Job few months before the pandemic hit the France hard and I was left with only a few thousands to spend on bills and food which will only last me some months, one morning as I was surfing through YT, I came across a video that talk about a certain trader by name Edward Rowe who provides bitcoin trading coaching and signals and gave it a try by investing 0.5 BTC and surprisingly for me I made a profit of 6 BTC in less than 3 weeks. If you want to make it out of this depression alive and stronger I urge you to make the right step, you can reach Edward for assistance via tele-gram: @EdwardRowe
so cool bro
YES FINALLY
can this be downloaded in 1.18 (aswell with mods)?
Its really sad when a trixyblox video ends
the wait was worth it
The legend is back I've been waiting for 2 months
For the snowy mountains it would be cool if there was some sort of abandoned steam punk mining rig
You should open this map as a server and have tons of people join! Love the hard work!
blowing us away
Me jus liekin every coment cuz they nice
boudiste temple for the next biom
Cool
You should try a mine using the Create mod. That would be a sight to behold
I was on the edge of my chair the entire video! honestly can't wait
Have you built a mosque?
I think the big mountain explosion misses
What about the nether?
Will this world be available on Bedrock edition?
Can bedrock players join this server
The real OGs were there for the first part
Does it cost money to play this map when it is finished
Is it just me or does he sound alot like wisp? 🤔
amazing tho
Cool
I would can say this is true meaning of Minecraft Adventure mode
4:56 thought he was going to say bank
For the never you should do a ginormous never caves and also some fortresses roaming with more blood was spawn is like with a skeleton spawner Zande and Piglet and Bastian is a special
I hoped it was free
dude this is awesome but i must say you have too much spare time
Which People Dislike thos video So, That Was Looser  i  really Like This World❤️
Will there be a large lush cave?
that was pretty cool. I have suggestions you should add  random chest around the map (not too much) this will make people explore more.
this is the best build i have ever seen!
Hey Trixy! You should add some sort of oasis to your mesa!
PLEASE FINISH THIS WORK
Can’t wait to play this map with my friends
It would be cool if you played on this map for 100 days/let's play
dude indian culture would be much appriciated......i bet u got majority of ur viewers from that country
Content is really good keep it up
That is the best map Minecraft had ever witnessed
I legit cannot wait to get my hands on this world, like, my friends and I have already planned to buy a server thingy while I buy this map for us to explore and have nedless fun on! Dude, your work is fucking MAGICAL!
you should add an orthodox church. they have large domes and they are usually painted on the inside
dude ur building is AMAZING, all my builds look like doo doo you got a lot of talent
Me seing that you used red candles as dynamites :wooow
After the map has been out for a while I would love a story like play through where you guys explore through your story line and survive through the biomes just in case we miss something while playing or may want to watch before we play! (Spoilers included of course) 😊
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MAP TO COME OUT!!!!!!
YESSSS I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG FOR THIS TO COME OUT!!!
boy i love this game
Your work is INSANE! KEEP IT UP! Great job!
Where is download link
Hello everyone I'm new here😁👋
Join are amazing amazing
Yessir I've been waiting for this sheeesh
So amazing...Every time trixyblox out does himself this is EVERYTHING a Minecrafter could want and I'm so excited to play this!!!!
THIS LOOKS AWESOME,I can’t WAIT for this to be done also , if you can,can you try to add some genshin impact style stuff in the next biome?
Make taj mahal one of 7 greatest thing in world and it's presents the love sing for partner
pls build a swiss town in the snowy mountain biome
9:47 *sings in cartoon* SECRET TUNEEEEL
A mandir will be good religious purpose
snowy mountain
Suggestion: You may add some small deserted island around the ocean near the main maps! U should also tranforms all of those dungeons that spawn underground.  edit: some of them may have loot too.
Is this going to be on bedrock
Bro it took ya so long that i lost inturest
Can you pay on bedrock
I am very poor I want to play this map but I have no money 😭😭😭
It started as a 1 million subscriber special. Now he has more than 2 million subscriber 😁😄
would be nice for the western town if there was a clock tower since it would fit the theme of the builds
I can see minecraft youtubers doing surviving 100days in Ultimate survival world!
Suggestion: Add tiny Details to all the biomes  Example: Random Abandoned house  Dead bodies  Random camp sites  Random chests  Random holes/ dried lakes
Please create a Indian temple for the next video
wow nice builds
It’s so impressive that only two people are making a whole Minecraft map
While yeah 16,000,000 blocks seems HUGE, you really need to put it into perspective to see how big it actually is! Minecraft world span about 30,000,000 blocks (although with commands it can be higher), most people don't travel past 20,000 blocks from spawn. Also, 1 minecraft block = 1 meter (3.28 feet) in the real world, 16,000,000 meters is bigger than some countries!
Hey Trixy, is this map available on Bedrock edition? If so, I’m gonna be so happy!
Yay
I hope this map can be downloaded for free
Man wants money 💀💀💀💀
Some give this guy a round of applause 👏
please tell me this is free to download when its finish.
I love the wild west! I've been waiting since the start of the USW for this! Can't wait to play and gl with the rest of your project!
100 days in a usw
Speaking of worship places for the biomes yet to come: Norwegian Staff Church or Mountain temples like in Nepal. If you happen to have some swamps you could aswell add Temples/city like Ankor Wat, Cambodia.
Is this going to be free on pocket edition
Where are all the horses?! 🐎
250,000 likes! Not like it's gonna not happen...heh heh... *100 years later* FINALLY!
YOOOOOO TRICKY UPLOADED
will it be on bedrock java or both ?
You need to build a sky world with a mega castel
I really want you to do something so that the Free to Play community can play on this map too. I BEG OF YOU.
The wild west town was great but next video add a hospital to the town
You should make the mountains a Japanese theme with monastery a large holy temples and lots of dragon statues
I NEED TO SEE A TEASER TRAILER OR SOMETHING
11:53 What are the hour and minute hand made out of?? Is it chains??
Can you make an Fort please
I thought this would be done in like 4 months but I guess not lmao
Can't wait for this world to be released
For the snowy mountains place of worship, do the Salt Lake Temple in Utah. I think it is a beautiful structure that would realy look pretty in some place like the snowy mountains!
Please add a Dead Dragon skeleton! It's just cool!
I want to download this plz give me the download link
Will we be able to buy the map without subscribing to Patreon ?
bruh you should be trending #1 on minecraft
Beautiful build. For the savanna build, may I suggest referencing the fallen Mapungubwe civilization in South Africa? Perhaps you could also explore how it would have developed if it didn't fall when it did 👀
If you could, would you try to consider adding hostile campsites/pillager camps to make the biome more engaging? I would love to have a Red Dead Redemption feel to Minecraft
Trixy can you also upgrade lush caves and warden city like one of a mines was opened in a lush cave where cave mans use to live and same for the warden city as the legends say there is a mythical creature who lives deep inside the cave it will bring more life in ur project plzzzz
I love ur builds honestly
Definetly my favourite so far, keep it up :)
all the detailing and little secrets which you may not see at first glance is absolutely insane! I am so surprised that you have found a way to make all of this survival friendly and can't wait to get on the world with my mates and start discovering!
Maybe you could make the taiga or snowy mountains an oriental japanese type style? I think the roofs of these types of buildings would look quite nice, especially if you used a darker material to contrast to the white snow
You need to find the endertempel and watertempel
Please at some point put this on the bedrock marketplace or something, just a easier way other then patrion.
You could have put the native americans in this region
This world is the best Minecraft build of the year.         Literally.
You do amazing work I can't do I want to be a bulder one day but I don't thank about this. Keep up your good work. Maybe you will be as famous as grain one day.
I am so excited for this to come out
Cream
INSINAENIAEINIENNSUOGWa
Looks like something from the Daltons
You could create a mod with MC creatr so you also have custom mobs and maybe minerals…
badlands is the western us and mesa is africa so yehh there would be no savanah and there would be pine trees
I wish he would put a mod that will be having some mid evil mod some wester and some quest for that i would definitely play with this and it would be fun
Put the bell in the churc
U are epic for rea
Among Us!
Jo mama
Maybe just maybe make a railway track around the whole world? And do a little minecard railway under it?  It would honestly be very cool to travel around the world
I wish this was the actual minecraft, because, this is how I wanted minecraft since ages, really like your work, love your videos too
The fact that you're planning on upgrading the other dimensions IN ADDITION to what you've already done is insane! Your dedication to this is very admirable.
Please upgrade snowy mountain next and aad more custome bosses and mobs
The song in the end sounds suspiciously like the dune song
honestly a ranch would go perfect in this biome
Red Dead Redemption in Minecraft. I love it. Can't wait to play this world
Join hermitcraft!
God you build
are you going to add. your own mobs?
Hindu temple
Please brother again I am requesting you please build a hindu temple/mandir please🙏
Can’t believe I actually just wiggled in excitement when I saw this on my suggested🤣🤣
Why is it that Trixyblox can Build better than the Pantheon of Minecraft Developers
I really love how TrixyBlox will be releasing this in about a couple years or months, but I cant wait until he releases it out!
Dude...this is gonna be the best map in the world....
Hindu temple next ep
I would really love to play in   this but i don't think i can afford this if it needs to be paid, i just hope this is free to download but i highly doubt that
Add a Hindu mythology temple
You could try making a hindu temple. But damn dude, you are a legend.
Cupid scar
Can you make the world download free please 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Love your work keep it up oh and I'd like to see an observatory place if it's not too much or an old design of a abandoned battleship
I love how you're builds are so unique and inspiring!!!! Dude this is EPIC! And that is why I subbed :)
I wanted to ask something @TrixyBlox , would there be nether in USW ? And if so would that be transformed too ?
Biggest mc project ever!
Wenn i can download that Freeware? :(
What about upgrading the caves?
TRIXy!! U are forgettong the nether,end and the end ship!!!
him : puts months on a map and a cool story me : as a speedrunner getting ready for speedrunning the map
This Man should be invited to join hermitcraft
Bro the background music is very fitting in the enviroment its actually kinda fire🔥 i cant wait until this finished but i think my computer is probably gonna explode if i download this😅
Yo congrats on 2mil subs and 1mil likes on the first video of this series
How dafuq can you do something like this?
Yo congrats on 2mil subs and 1mil likes on the first video of this series
In the snow biome their souls be a abandoned village up on one of the mountains it's pretty small, and there's said to be a yeti in the mountain witch is why it's abandoned, but there's no yeti it's a mine of diamonds the rumor was started by a greedy person who wanted it all for themself maybe they moved some where .... Warmer?
honestly i avoided the whole series so i wont get spoiled for the map `
will it be released to non patreon members?
I’m hoping there will be a texture pack to change the look of the mobs to make the map look like a whole new game. If not I can always add my own shaders and texture packs
Hindu temple
Next underwater kingdom video
We Need More content of this
I wonder if he will upgrade the coral biome?
A temple pls for the next place of worship
i actually heard a train while watching the bit where he built the train
Yes but can you do for Bedrock edition
It’s going to be soo much fun playing this map
Just a simple idea crossing by, can you add buildings looking similar to korea & china's traditional house for taiga biome?
this shit is amazing man
In the Mesa put a secret about John Wayne
😯 Wow
Don't give it on paitron
Bro we can play in bedrock
Hey, Can you port this to bedrock when its done if possible?
please use hindusam in next village
I can't wait to snow one
Well worth the wait. Unreal stuff!! Very excited to play on this world!
Make a rollercoaster in minecraft
SEEEEEEEEEEESHHHHHH THAT WORLD IS BUSSIN
Indian temple needed
can you get someone to make vanilla custom mobs? not modding just stuff like big phantoms or super strong zombies? this would make the gameplay harder and longer. some dungeons too. pleaseeee
u should ask daniel kraft to make custom mobs for these worlds
Taiga or Snowy Mountains could be inspired by Norse paganism with a heathen hof as the place of worship.
finally my favorite biome Mesa :D
(5th time) plzz build a taj mahal
only thing that left , new mobs and bosssessss
Where are we meant to build our house 😂😂
This is just so Red dead Redemption like….I LOVE IT
Dude this is too cool!! <3
For doing such hard work, and only posting a 15 min vid is I think a bit crazy. So i think a longer vid like a half an hour would be cool. Anyway can't wait to play this world.
:0
Literally checked your account yesterday to see if you uploaded omgggg
I am from India and in India soo much people are waiting for this world 🌎
Thnx man 💝 u made my day .... can't wait to play on this
Are you ever going to make an Indian still build in this survival world
HOW ABOUT THE MANGROOVE FOREST??!!

"One of many, *many* seeds"
That Video was awesome! Congratulations on the 2 mil 🥳

disappointed that you didn't add any horse stables
Pls make a temple in snowy mountains

YAY MY FAV YOUTUBER UPLOAD
holy shit that's fucking awesome
i live in nevada, which was a big part of hte "wild west" and i can tell you, in my entire 15 years of living here, ive never seen those pillars
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS , But 1.16 plz
imagine if world edit didnt exist
Said it once and I'll say it again.  Volcano
Imagine a build battle between TrikyBlox and Grian, who would win 🤔
yeah babyyyyyyyy
The sad part is some of the players have bad building skills which wont fit in the world '='
Imagine if this wasn't vanilla minecraft
try making a modern city and talk about time travel
What shaders are you using?
That music was so sick!
this guy really frogot about the swomp boime
I wish I could download the map but my parents won’t let me get patron
Make a video of the interior for the people that can't afford to purchase Patreon subscription
NativeAmericans in the Savana ??????
Wow, also the shaders are something great too with the fog, anybody know what shaders those are?
TRIXY PLEASE make a Indian temple (mandir)
Mesa and badlands both are my favorite biomes
Perhaps the place of worship in the savanna should mimic something from the African savanna in real life
Uuuuuuuuuuuu 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Once I download the Spotify just gonna do/creative end put TNT all over it was the bill though looks amazing keep going this is beautiful
Petition for a hindu temple in snowy mountains (like kedarnath)👇
Hello Trixy, can i play this in single player?
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS EPISODE YASS YEEHAW
steph more like step sister
You should do a eastern Orthodox Russian style church for snowy mountains or tundra
I would like you made a hindu temple
My idea for place of worship in Savannah biome would be a Hindu Temple, because it would be quite fitting for the somewhat warm biome of Savannah which actually resembles the weather of most Hindu countries (like India). Anyways good going in the project would love to see what you would do next
TRIXY YOURE THE MOT LEGENDERY MINECRAFT BUILDER EVER😁😁😁😁😁😁 AND KEEP GOING MY MAN¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
For the snowy mountains you could make a "chaple on the mount" surounded by some peus with a campfire in the middle. I do think that would fit there!
The next place of worship should be a Greek temple
Please don't make us pay for this world mannn it's so epic
If you mix it with more creature addons thats would be so amazing
69k likes LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
imagine if he secretly upgraded the nether and end in this world…
I can't wait to get my Arthur Morgan on.
@aCookieGod pls play this world
Don't forget the 1.18 update 🔥🔥🔥
Me whos gonna get the world and probably chop down all the trees ruining the beautiful world
I got an idea for you bro. Combine the USW with the create mod. That would be so cool looking
How did you learn to build like that
Mm yes procrastinate designing my kingdom to watch this. No regrets.
just love this emoticon because I can't speak English because I'm from Indonesia👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
This is my favorite place on this map by far
dude this guy spends hours maybe days just to make a 15 - 20 min vid but still tho ITS SO DANG COOL CAN'T WAIT FOR IT TO BE DONE!!!! Keep up the good work man!!
It would be cool if like, the savannah or something was based off ancient greece.
It's been such a journey to watch this man's progress in this ultimate minecraft survival series, and I can't wait until i can play this server when it is finished and released. Good luck trixyblox
Beautiful
Man, you've got the most impressive MC builds I've seen on YouTube and I'm so excited to see the rest of this series and then hop into the world myself. Keep up the good work and don't fell the need to rush anything. Once the map is more or less complete, t'd be great if you could find a way to move this over to an updated world so that features like the deep dark will be present.
someone should do a 100-day-survival video on this with mods
I think it would be really cool to incorporate a temple similar to the lds temples because they are absolutely stunning!
I think it would be really cool to incorporate a temple similar to the lds temples because they are absolutely stunning!
It’ll be very disappointing to be in the nether when you come there.
Savannah's place of worship can be a tribal temple with sacrificial pits and a bit like the jungle place of worship
the badlands in this vid would make a great steel ball run map
I WAS WAITING FOR SO LONG FOR THIS VIDEO
This is the first time I’ve ever considered buying a Mc map from a YouTuber. It just looks so fun and I honestly am so curious about the interiors
am sooooooo exited to play on this map, I think it would be a fire experience
first off, for my fellow mod users. what command and mod lets me retro gen ores for this map.
How about the Hindu place of worship. A Mandir I don't know if it will fit but yea
Do you plan to upgrade Nether World? It would be awesome to fire up a lost nether portal and find ourselves in a true hell :D
Omg I'm so excited for this video. Been waiting for what feels like ages!
I want a Hindu temple
Add the mod villager guards,bandits, pirates and medieval craft. It will be nicer if you add these mods and add the mod moreswordsandshields(I forgot the mod name)
I Know i say this ever USW video, but im hoping theirs a mineshaft rollar coaster in the Snowy Mountians
Can you plsss add some things in Jumanji
Hey trixy make some Indian themed temples
Let's go we finally got part 5 and watching it made me sure that wait was worth it. I can't wait to play on the map!
the best so far
Maybe a youtuber gonna invited 100 player to play this map!
I think the mesa its the mesa and the jungle its the biggest projekt so far yet
This map would be soooo go on a modpack I can not wait
Wow wish i could build like this always wanted to just dont have the gaming skill
trixyblox how do you perfectly copy and paste?
This is looking like its supposed to be a full fledged Minecraft DLC Expansion.
Will this be available to console players?
Just a little question, is the server able on both bedrock and java？
if he could add Japanese culture in one of the biomes that would be dope. also, what will the nether be? transformed into hell? i can't wait
Your imagination is on next level
you should add a few mods
Ah but if only there was a grand canyon like thing in there with rapids etc etc
this needs to have some mods on this
Woowww
In this world you could add a nether with all the biomes and floating islands for the end.  Just an idea.
this is so freaking cool
i really like the map i wish i could play on it keep up the good work
I dare you to build the deathstar
Probably one of the most underrated Minecraft builder out there
I think he used red candles for he dynamite. Thats so creative yooo
SO READY FOR THIS TO COME OUT!!!!
Did somebody say *LORE*
Next religious building ideas:  Buddhist temple Hindu temple Japanese temple Sikh gurudwara  Idk 😐 if they will suit the builds but incase u want to add them.. here's a little idea
200 + hours or so, condensed into 15 minutes. you deserve more credit.
I think this just might be my favourite biome yet. Love the work, I cannot wait to play it!
Cant wait to play it!
My faveriot biome is mesa
Who tryna play this map with forge labs zombie apocalypse mod pack
You should put a little minecart rail so when we discover the canyon we could go around looking at the view
"I don't want to spoil to much for when you play the map yourselves." He says while you have to pay for the map. Sorry dude but I'm a broke student, I don't have even a dollar to spare.
Worship place suggestion :- Temple
Pls make a temple in savvanah
Can you release this for minecoins on xbox/mobile
You are op
you should have added stables
It would be awesome with new villager skin for each biome
my opinion but this is the best so far
What would be cool would be if someone did one of the Minecraft social experiment where they see how everyone that stuffed into the MC works acts when they have to make a civilization. It would definitely make the experiment seem awesome.
Will the world be a free download on patreon or would I have to be a member
will the new underground biomes get their own upgrade?
I can just see MythicalSausage freaking out rn
how about the ocean?
How much will it cost to get the map
So we have to buy the patreon to play?
finally!!!!!
You should sell some of your creations to the developers for console gamers to be able to buy, download & play your worlds......
This is gonna be so cool when finished!
IM SO EXCiTED FOR THIS WORLD OMG!! ive never bought a map before, but as soon as this series started, I knew i would be buying it once it was finished!! cant wait! great work Trixy and Steph!!  <3
Why don't you make bedrock maps :( we bedrock players can't do anything else than just watch and feel jealous that everyone just makes Java maps because it is easier
I don't know if you chose another civilization for the snowy mountains but I'd like it to be Tibetan/ Nepalese inspired being that these are known for their mountains and how their people live with them.
will it work for bedrock patron members? or just java
USW yesssssssssssssssssssssss_ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Tbh, if you sent a job application to mojang to work on minecraft. You would 100% get accepted in an instant.
Can you make the savannah a aboriginal themed place pls (aboriginal is a culture in Australia)
I kinda hate people like this if you wanted you did not have to put it in Patreon I have it and thank you for the map and I Know it took a lot of time make but what about people that really like it and can't get it I'm not a hater btw I love his work
please add a hindu temple
plese add a hindu temple
This is awesome! Can't wait for the other dimensions!
my goodness he's not joking his last video was literally 2 months ago
If the snowy mountains was based of Japanese themes, you could do a monastery for the place of worship, and cherry blossoms 🌸
its will be great if it have a mod like a new wepond or boss
I'd love to see some sort of Norse themed temple/altar in the taiga or snow biome!  That said, I love this series!
Do Hinduism in next video
i cannot wait
It’s been a minute since you posted for this series, but I have to say, this was certainly worth the wait.
Can you upgrade every week
pls atleast give USW map for free man plllllllls
Can you add like a Buddhist or Jain temple or statue in like a Chinese-Indian-Nepali type of mixture place.
This map: exists My computer: every moment I live is agony
As well as having a good time watching Trixy's videos, we're also learning history along the way.
you should work for Minecraft and add these structures!  Im also really glad Im getting java on computer soon so I can play this!
Are you gonna do anything with the new deep dark in the usw when it comes out?
I find the idea of him throwing away hundreds of hours of work because he didn't hit the like goal funny.
Wow
ok, now i'm getting upset because I don't own minecraft java :(
Will this be available for free? Also is it possible for it to transfer to Minecraft PE?
remember the nether and end :)
I’d love to play, but I’m broke
This build is so awesome, ty for putting it on ur patreon for everybody to download!!!  Wow I do sound like a channel bot don’t I…
This was great can’t wait to play
i need play this aaaaa
I cant wait to play on this world man like its so cool and his narration just takes me into that world Love you bro ! Keep making them 🔥🔥🔥
I wont be able to play this on Xbox will I 😂😂 anyways still enjoyable to watch
you kind of fucked the landscape up with too many small rock pillars. there should be way less and bigger ones. the town is cool but i would imagine more than one house would be needed
This is awesome and your resource pack for bedrock as well
Ah yes, RedCraft Redemption.
I thought he said he'd release this free at some point?
This biome is amazing! Well done!
This reminds me of the garudo region in the legend of Zelda breath of the wild
Hey! I'd love to subtitle your videos in spanish for free. It's my first language and I'm obsessed with this survival world. Let me know if you are interested!
Bro u are really osm 😊☺️🤞🏻
It would be cool if you made part of the rail road broken and torn with a trail falling or hidden and broken as if someone came and destroyed it.
i can´t wait to play this map, is looking amazing. is a shame that it isn´t the same version as the pixelmon mod, it whould look so good with pokemons all across the map.
Can you customize the nether?
Mohjang wasting their time not hiring this man😤
Imagine finding an SO that writes stories for your minecraft project. Good on you, trix.
A Secret Genie Lamp On The Mesa [you can make is very hard to get it] (also i Like The Outlaw's)
If the snowy mountains were Norse/Viking based that would be pretty cool
mommy
Yes! I almost forgot about this. TYSM!
Too bad I won’t be able to play this until I get a new computer.
Idea for the Icy Thundra or the Spruce Forest: Should add a Fox or Wolf Den with a secret Treasure room.
Sheesh dude go outside
You should somehow implement a soundtrack that changes based on the biome your in
You deserve much more 😘bro Hope your hardwork will payback  Loved the video ❤️
This is underrating!
really looking forward to making a server with this map, much worth joining your patreon for a couple bucks to play on it this looks amazing.
I’m waiting to make a banger video on this map!
6:01 water tower supplies water-TrixyBlox 2021
Ngl, kinda reminds me of red dead redemption and back to the future part 3
Like the video not the comments
Lets go!!!
Is there a specific texture pack?
Near the edge of this mesa , close to the savanna areas, he could build a broken tower of babel with a zombie town next to it. That can be used for prime lore material and will spice the backstory up.
LETS GO ITS FINALLY HERE
i find it neat how good he is with world edit
Beautiful.
I have a suggestion make a cave where that wither from previous videos would reside.  It would have the t of soul sand and 2 skulls but you could have to go on an adventure to get the third.  I will get the patron if you do this.
I would really really love to see your interpretation of an Indian and/or Japanese castle in the map, since they have very distinct and beautiful silhouettes and would be very noticeable from great distances due to their height versus the common small villages
Of all of this just made me think of Rango
question. are you gonna add any mods or stuff to make the world more as you intend it(wich will be optional)? als keep upl the great work!
went this relast its cana be cool
Nice work putting the prison right next to the bank.
PHENOMENAL
Are you going to incorperate the new hight and depth into this at all? o:
Cool
Ok I have had an idea  I want someone to make a kinda smp of this where we can have like 300 people and there's like 50 people in each biome I can't come up with a lot more but I would like to see this and I can help if someone does make this
Is this playable on only java, or can mobile play?
this seems good enough i gues add a giant castle in the snowy mointain please add underground railroad please
Ok so I don't want to be annoying or anything because you are spending so much time on this, but I think it would really cool If you put some Gaelic style stuff in the outskirts of the taiga in the plains, of course if you don't thats completely fine because I am so excited for this (I even made skins for it!) but if you could do this it would be awesome, thanks for everything you do! :)
Wow.... i can't wait to see the world for myself! How are you so good at building!!
No school?!!!
Trixy blox can you make a marine city biome like atlantis :)
i would love to have the snowy mountains in a nordic style with viking towns and maybe some norse lore involved.
Yee haw
Now i wish i had minecraft :(
This seems familiar
I think you should atleast put a clock tower, you know back tot he future 3 vibes..
Emezing
Episode starts at 2:18 if u want to skip ahead.
I would love to see some tradicional asian architecture in one of the biomes, keep up the great work mate!
@TrixyBlox where ist the fort ? Or the Indianer Camps?
Make Chinese culture cuz the walls look cool
Is it just me or does the crane on the right look like YO 12:40
can u play this with the better minecraft modpack?
Hell yeah! I found this series and channel like a week ago and saw that all the videos come out 1-2 months apart. Knew this would come soon!
Hell yeah! I found this series and channel like a week ago and saw that all the videos come out 1-2 months apart. Knew this would come soon!
Hell yeah! I found this series and channel like a week ago and saw that all the videos come out 1-2 months apart. New this would come soon!
Is it possible for you to make tiny islands around the mega map & build floating islands above the mega map
what if u have ultimate survival world texture pack which changes how villagers look in different biomes and also any advances on having some modern to make custom mobs and villagers with unique interactions and resources
Hell yeah! I found this series and channel like a week ago and saw that all the videos come out 1-2 months apart. New this would come soon!
How in ra fuck did you not get burn out
Now get 10-20 modders to mod this world then you have a perfect Minecraft map
This man is insane, he should be on the MC dev team revamping biome generation
YEAH FINNALY NEW VIDEO
Another  magical world from you .Execllent
Please release next even if you don’t hit like goal it’s honestly too good
roleplay in this world would be crazy awsome
I'm not allowed to buy patron so I can't get it :< know I just have to watch other people have fun
For the snowy mountains you should make like Nepal with like buddhism
Are you uploading it on forge?
What if this map turn in to a open map game that would be so insane pls somebody make a game then take this map
Nether upgrade confirmed!!!
It kinda reminds me of that one Scene in the lego movie
THANK YOU for this upload. This is amazing i know it takes you a really long time to make this stuff im just really happy to see you've uploaded
I started this series yesterday and this came as a blessing
Amazing work.
i can see a steel ball run happening in this wild west town
Phenomenal building, I just have some concerns with the railroad; normally the water tower by the station would be where the actual locomotives would stop, not at the other end of the platform. And also regarding the track, most of those turns would be impossible for a train to make, like how there is a 90' turn in one of the bridges. Regarding all that I know this is you interpretation of these things, I thought I should just point them out.
Arthur Morgan liked that.
super mind blowing coolllllllllllllllllllllll
Can you play this on bedrock edition?
this is the first place im going when we can use this world
So many world edit two-peak mound additions
Sadly I can't play in this world😢
Ur builds are incredible .can't wait too see finished masterpiece
Fav biome so far
Is this going to be available for bedrock and java?
Its not a mistake its just a ✨bean✨
yoooooooo theres another one out!  edit: I just realized something, but first you'll need some background. In my school the orchestra class has this thing that we do called orchestraland, and we have a bunch of characters and all that in it, but the layout of the room and our drawings of orchestraland are almost exactly the same as the layout of this world. The right of the room holds violin volcano and violin village, violin volcano is essentially a wasteland because of a recent eruption so the desert and mesa fit that well, and violin village works well with the mesa village that you make in this video. the middle area is viola valley, and while there isn't a valley, the area around the valley is essentially a plains, as well as there being a river flowing through it. to the right of the room is cello forest and that also fits in pretty well to where the jungle is, as well as the jungle temple fitting almost perfectly to the position of the bass base I.R.L. and finally the dark oak forest is directly in the correct place to be the forbidden forest, the forbidden forest isn't connected to the mainland, but there's also an evil presence in there, and a league of villains (you might consider a family) that had there base set up there but mysteriously disappeared. the island is even in the exact same shape.
if you are done with the Ultimate Survival Minecraft world please make it available for everything even the people who are not in Patreon like myself i really want to play this world but i dont want to use patreon since it uses some money so please make Ultimate Survival Minecraft world available for everyone
Incredible. I love you how you never take the easy route
Minecraft having having this much detail makes it have the same storage space as GTA 5🤣 and the video was too short. I appreciate the work and time put in this project and can't wait to get the map.
can we get a ziggurat as a place of worship?
You are an amazing builder and deserve many more subscribers.  Thanks for inspiring me to build better!
I have been waiting for this for so long
The effort that went into this 😍
what about an indian style temple
Can't wait to play this and experience this world you are creating. keep up the great work
I really want this to be free.
How do you do this??? He’s a Minecraft Genius
man i hope this map is available for tlauncher :( me sad cuz dont hab enof moni to buy minecraft :( me sad more
This map is so incredible but it’s virtually unplayable in survival because of the scale
It seems cool until you realise there's only 1 structure throughout the entire biome
No swamp?
Red Dead Anyone?
When the world is done i will fiest go and raid ybe bank
This world is gonna be so cool
Is this going to be available for mobile?
I don't normally play Minecraft anymore since that I've grown up and moved away from these sorts of games buy when this comes out I'm gonna play this all of the time. It looks awesome
Add a city underground?
Can't wait
United States of the World; USW
ADD CUSTOM MOBS TOO....
Imagine this map was server and all player works likes real-life in different biome. What can be better. 😆
One thing, this map is gonna be a pain to navigate
I want to see islamic village pls✨✨😭😭
I’m on bedrock I will never play it 😔
i know this isn’t supposed to use mods but it would be crazy if there was an box mod just imo it would make it more immersive and make the story feel a lot more real. worlds like these tend to feel empty alone.
U should join HERMITCRAFT...
I have no words dude  It's amazing ❤ 💙 💜
wow i cant play this map for free fuck i look like buying this mans patreon  jus to play a minecraft map lmao its like buying a nft
Plz make nether biome
This guy might beat grian if he finishes this island
It is possibally the best build in the usw
This is literally Mata Nui!
When Trixy uploaded it's good day for me ❤️🔥👍
cool
Nice👌
Hate to tell you this but. The railway is kinda to fast with the turns
He always saying "when you play this map for yourselves" im not allowed to donate $5 on patreon... :(
amazing🥺
Love the dedication
Wow every map i have played either has good interior but bad exterior or amzing exterior but no interior. And here you are building both of those things heck even the nether and end you are the coolest minecraft youtuber i have ever met. Good luck stay safe please do not overwork yourself and goodbye.
You rly forgot the stables huh :(
Can you try putting in a gurdwara for a place of worship? Love the vids, keep it up
You should probably get some other great builders to help you and speed up the process 😁
Idk if you will see this TrixyBlox but how would you feel if once you finish this someone created an smp? Like of course all credit of the lore and world would go to you but create an smp with the world?
Did you remember to add a barracks for the miners? They need a place to sleep haha
There better be a piano in that saloon
It amazing!
You have to sell this on the bedrock marketplace
This is just crazy TrixyBlox, UVE OUTDONE YOURSELF!
Can someone play this and record for me
I was waiting so long for this! <3
I think you should add like an DeLorean in the Mesa Biome for like an easter egg about BTTF
Why don't you made Himalayas in snow biome
oh its my bday rn when u upload this
Water tower and mine’s structures are a little bit slim, it seems that they need like stronger pillars to hold the weight
Educational episode
Everyday, I'm literally checking ur yt channel if u posted this next vid already
Hey block I got a build idea a futuristic bunker
he really loves the word "tackle"
It would have been cool if on the train track, it broke unexpectedly, and a train just barely made it.. Or so they thought. But the train moved a bit too far and just hung there off the broken bridge track.
Mate, have you just reached the half way mark?
Yo u should also try to find and or make an awesome custom mod for this world
Since you asked about the next place of worship, I think a Shinto temple would be really cool
Interactio
amazing!!!!
wer bedrok
Reply to me with ANYTHING, and I'll have to say: "I agree."
I hope this is available and everything😭😭 i’m too broke to get a pc 🤣🤣😭
it would be really cool if the was a broken train sitting at the bottom of the canyon, and a section of track that looked newer
U r doing it like a god for Minecrafters
How many more Biomes
👏👏👏
FINNALY MY FAVORITE BIOMES
for the ice you should have a frozen town
Ah ur back
I feel like you should go back to the plains and jungle biomes and implement a couple of the new 1 .18 blocks, although that’s your choice and they still look amazing
You should of added a stable
R u gonna do anything with the nether or end
TB
I was wondering if you could make the map available for bedrock players any way great job bro  Pls like this so trixy can see it
Maple farm for taiga or snowy biome please. If you want.
Is there going to be a plot associated with the map? Like a goal that you are supposed to achieve and a direction for you to follow in order to see everything in the world in a natural way
Bhudha temple
Best minecraft serie ever
Same I want to play it.
what about the nether fortress
AWESOME!!!!
lol i dont have money so cant do patreon  ;-;
Woah, you got 2 Million
100 hour+
Would’ve love to see a mad grave yard with a like a area for the bodies like red dead and a cattle yard and a place to break horses
Ive been waiting for this videoooo
Love the videos! For the acacia biome, you should incorporate some Sub-Saharan African styles, perhaps like Great Zimbabwe
For the taiga biome is great to see eastern style building. Btw all of your build is fantastic
Those ending shots were insane!
Download link. Now. Cough it up.
You should have added a horse stable
AMAZING WORK (as always)
Like the damn video goddam
will i be able to download this on mobile?
When you eventually upgrade the underwater ruins, you can leave some traces of it being somehow connected to the Mer-people’s empire. For example, you can hide some books that tells the story of them being a seperated group away from the empire due to war with the underground kingdom. Then, you can make some trails to an underwater ruined medical center. There, you can put a chest, would be great if partially hiden but there are clues leading to it. Inside, you can stash some spare string, some potions and a book which contains a riddle that may goes : “Dear chosen one, found the uncovered. Way at the top, look for the the copper.” For the architecture, you should probably use the same style from the ocean empire. The roof of the buildings shall be made out of waxed oxidised copper and the dark prismarine. In side the spots that has copper, hide some chests that contains a few books that will be named : “Historical Events #1” and so on. In the book, there could be some evidence for the causes of the group to be stranded, some small events that occurred in the mean time and the big event which is why the civilisation is ruined ( due to the drowneds ). The quest will be reconstructing the heart of the sea and kill all the drowneds so that the people can return when you leave! From now on, it’s your turn for the lore. Hope you see this and like this idea
Elytra flight's gonna be AWESOME!
Plsss add transactions, for me to play with my little brother uuuuuuu
this reminded me of read dead redemption 2 good job 👍
woooooooow uncle what happened 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼😍
Can I recommend a Japanese style for the Taiga? You could use Shintoism or Buddhism as the local religion!
DID HE SAY THE NEXT!?!?
I will straight up buy a P.C. just so I can actually play this map when it comes out.
Please make a bedrock map USW please  And you need a break from The proget
I wish I could play this but I'm on console.
@Trixyblox do your  world's work  on Nintendo switch?
Me: I copied the crane design because I'm lazy Trixy: I copied the crane design because LORE
You guys are working day and night aren't you? Respect.
Yee haw, cowboy!
that building was in club penguin, lol
You should put the radiator springs racetrack into the mesa as an Easter egg    And in western towns(normally in America) you would drive/ride on the right side of the road not the left
This guy is sooo cool
Bro chill, this is minecraft
You always blowing up my mind
Who else has been waiting for this to come out. I love this, I'm so playing this when it comes out
Amazing build! West is best, east is least! Wyoming gang gang
you will do the nether and the end. Otherwise I love the map ❤️
Oscar you should make a secret underground area thats super futuristic
can this be uploaded to the bedrock minecraft store
I don’t know if you’ve seen “The Good, The Bad, The Ugly”, but there’s a big graveyard in that movie and I think that would be a great addition to the Mesa. Just a field of gravestones, somewhere not per sé close by the village.  Anyway, been loving this series, can’t wait for the next one!
Maybe a Thai place of worship?
Would this be available on bedrock?
Add the big tree from Madagascar to the savana
For a place of worship a buddhist temple in the mountians would be cool
The crazy thing is he spends all this time and condenses it into a 15 minute video
Watching him make the western town being built reminded me a lot of the dead by daylight map Grave of Glenvale so way cool by dude. :)
This guy deserves more followers. Love the world!
Very nice but will you add 1.18 new biomes
Uhm will this world also be available for bedrock?
I have waited for this! Its so cool
Honestly incredible, congrats on 2mil!
idk why but the music at the end has a very terra tech vibe to it
Hey why is your channel about Minecraft but you added blox/Roblox in your channel name
You have backups right? And extra extra backups? I would quit life if I just lost all this...
Add a yeti cave to the tiga or a winter cabin with a murder in it in the taiga. Can you also add a bank car and a bank to to the western town and a robbery in progress on the bank car with a train bridge that'd been exploded
We need TrixyBlox to create a video called "Surviving a 100 days in my custom world"
Firstly: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY.  Seriously, I'm signing up to your Patreon because this is just so great. Secondly:  I would love to see the Taiga biome have a Japanese them in those forests.  Likewise, I would love to see the snowy mountains with a great Norse / Viking feel up there! Thirdly:  I would love to see one or two of your underground builds added in, possibly with the fissure that opens underground separating two biomes. Fourthly:  I'll grab some Merch to support you two. Lastly:  You two are fantastic!  My kids and I love watching this series and we're all looking forward to exploring this together!
Is there any way you could play this on Xbox?
the train and the wind mill would look insane if the map was incorporated with the Create mod
This look amazing
Love your videos, you really put lots of effort into making them, and always have high quality.  Can’t wait till you finish this project.
Are u gonna recreate the nether too?
I love it but in a western era I don't think bridges would be used that much even in canyons because of the amount of would it would cost and plus the amount of years it would take lore wise
Dude, you're a god for spending that much time on a world. But I really really hope that it would turn out as amazing as you have imagined. Have a nice day :>
5:42 yeeaah i gonna take my horse to the old town ROAD i gonna ride til i can no more 🤣🤣 LOL
You said that you wanted to build different places of worship so please build a Buddhist pagoda or monastery in the snowy mountains
this Mesa build makes me want to play rdr2 again
I, as well as many other persons cannot wait to play on this world, but the things is that with my potato skill at building things, i will be everytie disapointed when I see an other builds 100000 tims better than mine, but itll be fun, props to trixy and merry chrismas
It would be really freaking awesome if we could get a version of this part of the map with compatibility with the mod Immersive Railroading.
In think the only thing that i would change would be a mod pack for advanced mobs, so that they fit in
SNOW MOUNTAINS NEXT PLS IT WILL BE SO COOL! And maybe you could add in like a yeti cave or abandoned camp out from explorers that froze to death? Or it could be the camp of the family that disappeared from their woodland mansion
Ask someone to use create to make the train Crain etc move
Those poor gold miners... They built all those bridges without realizing there was land around the entire canyon!
This is actually amazing, I love how you build and it has inspired me loads. I can't wait for this map to be out!
I think it would be so dope if you add ur own twist on the new cave generations and also add a lush and dripstone cave biome
Does anyone know the song at 2:19? I know it's in the description but no order and reordering of "western", "howdy" and "lofi" turn up any results
I think these videos are really cool
Hopefully a bedrock download will be available. It would make me sad if after all this watching and imagining, I couldn’t play it
Are you doing the cave biomes?
I really wanna play this world I can't wait to play it on my pc
Like for one of the snowy places there needs to be some sort of norce mythology and Viking stuff and Mabye a river that goes to a town that is going to be raided or has been raided
Will you be doing the nether and the end as well?
This world is going to be awesome!!
You should team up with command block geniuses, that way you can make the story element more interactive. There could be like some NPC’s that have dialogue and tell you about the story and give you missions and stuff. That would be awesome.
Try using the create mod for the train so it moves
Can i play this on mcpe
For the snowy hills you should make a castle sort of area who try to control the biome
I wish i'd have a chance to play this ,it's awesome and you put so much efforts in this ,i wish i could pay for the map ,but i can't 🥲  I hope a lot of peoples will buy it to make it up to all your work ! 😁thank's for all this amazing work
It would be nice to have a school, I think some far west town had that. Unless the church handles the children's education in this village.
You could try and sell the bedrock version of the map on the Minecraft Marketplace, that way you could get this epic project to people who haven’t heard of your channel, and get some money for it.
This comment exists for the sole purpose of boosting the YouTube algorithm.
Mountain region based on Tibet or Nepal!! Or even Japan. All of them have gorgeous mountain shrines.
I just realize that look like wano from one piece
HI PLS MEKI bedrock edition dowmload world ❤❤❤
This project is INSANE!! 😈❤‍🔥
How do you down load it on mobile
Will this be available for bedrock on xbox?
This Man is truly the Minecraft god
Please please please say you can put this on the bedrock store
This man should be on hermitcraft
This should be like a completely separate game on like PlayStation Xbox and stuff it’s so cool
You got a haircut, this is so sad :( :(
idea for sea mounument put an eye on the top
Vanillas!
Man I really have to say that this is the most beautiful Minecraft-project I've ever seen!
This is honestly brilliant and I am always looking forward to every new video of yours. And if I may say I think it would be really cool if the Savannah had a abandoned zoo or some kind of animal sanctuary. Your awesome Trixyblox, looking forward to your next masterpiece!
This is just fucking awesome. I suggest to add a fort and an indian camp, but it's just an idea... I think you do an amazing job with Steph, this looks sooooo goooood !!!!! Keep up the good work !!!!!
Please add an artic it would go hand and hand with the California gold rush and the Alaskan gold rush
I wonder is it gonna be possible to play this on bedrock?
EYYYYYYYYY
Hmm. I recommend taking Sergievsky Sobor for the Taiga biome, with Inuit buildings, as well as Tibetan-style buildings for the mountains.
HYPEEEE!!!!!
Yea
Do the ice spikes bieom
I dont know if its destiny but i remember this series, and coincidentally, youve uploaded 6 hrs ago
finally!!! good job trixyblox
Rango vibes
This is actually the coolest thing I have ever seen
At this point, I expect mojang to at least send him something like youtube play buttons for such an amazing world.
Imagine doing all this in survival good job and keep up the work.😀😀😀😀😀
i will make ayoutube playthrough and ai need subs
I feel like this survival world shouldn't *just* be a survival world. It has the potential to work better as an open world story adventure game just like Breath of the Wilds  I will honestly wait even a decade for the story and adventure elements to be added into the map
im gonna play this over the weekend
Absolutely love the railroad designs. Looking forward to seeing more too!
when I first came across your channel I imagined how incredible a fully custom survival world from you would be. but boy this is hugely exceeding what I thought was even possible
wow thats a crazy world respect that u done this. hope that is playable for the badrock version. but i reallly like the map. ( sorry for the bad english )
this gives off huge rdr1 and 2 vibes very good
Make sure to include cherry blossoms at some point
I need it in bedrock edition when it is done.
This is sort of a wacky idea, but you could make a religious building that worships the ender dragon, assuming ender dragon would be incorporated in the lore
Question, is the map going to be paid for or free?
ngl id like to see a shinto theme somewhere maybe the dark oak forest
AHHHHHH this is amazing! Can't wait to play it!
When it's done, imma sub on patreon for the download. Really excited
19 on gaming!!
How did he make the little cactuses on the big ones I'm confused.
Just an idea but I feel like adding a Fletcher for the western town would work well as they'd be like a gun Smith supplying bows and different types of ammo
Engineers build the world's tallest tower. *I Sleep* TrixyBlox rebuilds the whole biome. *Real Shit*
YOO! really cool :D also merry (early) christmas
This is probably my favourtite one of them all!
absolutely fucking insane
I would love to see trixy and WynnCraft work together
this would have been cool, but under the  train, you can have a minecart set of tracks that runs underground
I want to ask something about the patriot. So do I have to pay a certain  amount? For example, when you go on your patriot, there are three options, do I have to choose a pacific to get world downloads ( such as this one )?
Me wishing to receive a trixyblox merch
this great!  next do the snowy mountain biome
So this is the most modern village yet LIKE MATE A TRAIN?
Movie you say
what if or the snowy mountains he made a cool wizard tower for the iceologer
This has to be one of the best minecraft maps I've ever seen.
You made a mining area.. with no actually evidence of the earth being dug? look at irl mines, massive damage
Build idea: you could have made like some kinda steam punk boat considering all the rivers and they could be use for transportation of people or materials or trade with the other biomes.
if there is an asiatic village, it would be awsome!
can make this for bedrock ed to i know it takes a long time maybe there is a revert way
he is a mad lad fam
Grian has a competitor
Congrats on 2M subs, you deserve more considering how much work you put in
this is for now my fav biom of this serie
Will this be bedrock and pocket edition friendly, too?
The track shouldn't just go through the mesa it should go through the other biomes that way the rest of the biomes can get supply from the mesa. And the other way around so the mesa can git supply from the other biomes. And nice build man.
This is starting to sound like an RPG map only without the quest npcs
be honest, yall forget abt this project until he posts a new vid
is this world gonna cost money?
leaving a comment for interaction
do Scientology for the next religion in the next map pls. because it's a bit whacky and weird
It would be cool to see some architecture similar to the architecture of Timbuktu for the Savannah Biome
Your builds are so detailed, I am so exited to see the final result of this world!
The work you put in is insane
goated
When the map will come out for us to play?
You should add: *a small island thats more farther away than the mushroom island, which is a paradise island inspired by Hawaii and its full of tropical fish and axolotls.  *a hint towards the warden and the deep cities for one of the biomes.
I’m so excited for the new map
Hands down my favorite biome yet
Dooood u should partber with doctor4t the mod maker that is blowin up right now It can help with the custom mods for the world...
Make an underground city Please
Where will be the movie series?
Imagine if he did this all in survival 😳
that is phenomenal but there are WAY too many buttes, they're super rare irl and maybe you should take a few out, it's just too unrealistic, also they would have more strata (layers) but that's an easy fix
man, TrixyBlox rivals Grian in terms of skill
Is this going to be on bedrock as well?
I feel like there should be some vanilla trees, because for people like myself who don’t want the aesthetic ruined, it’s hard to climb up the big trees and remove all of the wood so the leaves can decay. I find it hard to mine the trees that aren’t just straight, but still looking forward to playing in this map.
Ill definitely want to play this
If minecraft was hytale
This series got you from 700-800k to over 2M subs and on the top 20 trending list for gaming.
Can you get the USW on Bedrock’s marketplace?
hahaha its funny knowing that no matter how much he builds, he will never be as happy as me when dream gave me compliment.
Will the chests around the map have things in them?
I think it would be cool to see a monestery in the taiga or snowy mountains.
OMG FINALLY THE TIME HAS COME FOR ANOTHER BIOME.🤩🤩🤩 You have no idea how happy am i to See another video of this❤️❤️❤️. Btw all you did for now is Just MINDBLOWING 🤯🤯🤯
I would maybe suggest that you build stavkirke (don't think there is an English word for that.) For the taiga/snowy biome since it was commonly seen in northern Europe during middle ages and there are only a few left today. As it stands now there is only 28 left from that time. "BTW love the vids man keep it up ur amazing 😁"
He’s probably not going to do this but it would be cool having a empty version of the map
Yoooo
Trixy, this project was really nice at the start. You are a great builder and have a lot of good ideas. But you could really do with asking someone else who isnt part of the project to look over how immersive your ideas really are. Cause lemme be real with you, a lot of them are just not.  At the start it was really cool, but the more and more you go into it, the more it feels like you are giving areas attention based on how you feel and not on what they need You go for looks over immersivenes, which is the complete oposite of what you are aiming for. The Desert Pyramid was one thing. The Forestvillage another. The Mansion too has a lack of space and dont get me started on the jungle ruins.  Now you come to this desert town and you not only give us once again a barely established town that is somehow capable of having a full on propped up bank and hotel but at the same time they couldnt afford to get a stonemade church? You know what you based this off of right? On a USA culture that was heavily christianized, meaning if they have made anything out of stone before any other business it was the church. And also the churche is usually not in the middle of the town like this either. But that isnt the only issue. You got a lot of stores in that village, which on its own is fine, but... where are the people that live there? If the storeowners supposedly buy from one another, the towns gonna be broke real quick, no matter how neat the lore is. Where are the other houses? Of mine workers and farmers and whatnot?  Oh and another thing: Where did they get spruce wood from in a Mesa Biome? Dont give me the "From the Taiga Forest" answer, thats obvious. But then they also would have brought over seedlings. You see what I mean? Your lore can be neat and everything, but take it from someone who built up a fictional universe for 15 years: World building is never over. You are giving us a barebones lore story and then say "Have fun". Thats lazy. You are not giving us a full fledged world, you are giving us random ideas that you somehow make it so they work together with no actual connecting parts,
For the snow biome you should base the place of warship on the Savior on Spilled Blood cathedral in St. Petersburg, Russia.
brooo u are insane! 🤣🤣 incredible work!
It would be amazing if Minecraft added these upgrades, like it's so cool
The Efforts bro.
As a builder in I can really appreciate the smallest details that you put into your buildings, like the cobblestone walls in different shapes, and it's just amazing to see you take this project to the next level. Keep up the good work!
YEEEEEEEEE-HAAAAAWWWWWW
I would lile a icy cult for the ice biome
How to hell do you manage to do all this do you even sleep
Insane insane insane. I really appreciate what you're doing. I really liked how you used red candles as dynamite, very creative. I was thinking you could place dynamite on the bottom of one of the railroad bridges as if someone was trying to sabotage the transport of gold.
Getting some rdr vibes
Make againt bee hive
For the moutons  you should do a explorer came there and built a civilisation
Ah late colonialism
TrixyBlox I had a thought about the water falls and rivers you make and you can't ride them because you use barriers. Instead you could also use structure void. They are like barriers but let entities throught them.
If you do a nether village, there should be a satanic citadel for worshipping the dark lord.
JOIN HERMITCRAFT
I learned more in this video about history than I do in school
Fact in minecraft: u can also use red candles as also dynamite
This map will have 100 days with sword4000 I bet
please add this on Android as well
Congrats on 2mil subs before 2022
Want to play it really bad but. The trees won't grow back though
Can you play this map on Bedrocj?
I might make a server on this world
How about this.  You add a plane crash on one of the beaches and put someback story behind the cargo plane crash
It's still absolutely mindblowing what you are doing here you deserve more attention  Keep the amazing work up
Very cool
That’s so cool!
I would love one place of worship to be like a stone circle
i cant wait to see how the other biomes turn out!
Minecraft is in Medieval age, is not a upgrade. Is a change.
orthodox church
Hay I have a idea like if you agree  but he should transform the nether and end too
Imma love playing this worlds! luv u blox <3
Grian But Ultimate
EARLY POST!!!! LETS GO!!!
Orthodox catherdal for the next biome
This is so amazing!!! Very worth the wait!! If possible, could you put some little hidden shrine type things in the tiger Woods for worship, rather than like a dedicated place in a village? Or alongside that if you want that.
will this be on the bedrock microsoft store
You should add a delorean infront of the train as a reference to back to the future 3
This is so cool!
this is so cool! i have  a suggestion for the train: maybe it could make a stop at each town around the map? hope its not to tedious.
I WANT IT ALL! AND I WANT IT NOW!
Finally !!! You made my day!
Ya
I like this lore
I wish that I have the visa card now so I can be a Patreon to support you on this marvelous map and the story it has  HAVE LIKED AND SUBSCRIBED
you should make a video answering comments to help come up with ideas for the other biomes :)
Idea for savannah structure a little tribe will be good addition
Sb jump
This man is singlehandedly making Minecraft 2
what shader did you use?
I have no clue why I did it but-    * I built a statue of Bo Jo (Boris Johnson) in minecraft*
Locomotive. Not Steam Train, Steam Locomotive, and that coal car is very commonly known as a tender
Kool
Will this eventually be on minecraft bedrock edition because not all of us have java
I want a temple
this world definitely needs a modpack!
I always found minecraft pretty boring because there isn't much to look at/discover.  But this looks good! I might try the game again 😉
New vid lets gooooo Looks insane so far  Keep going
This is my favorite
2 MILLION GG!!
Make a Japanese Theme in the mountains
Will we be able to play on bedrock?
It will be cool to add vikings for one of the bioms and have magic runes and the place of worship can be a huge magic secret temple with gods or something, nice work you are amazing ❤❤❤
I bet having the extended build height that comes from 1.18 is gonna be a godsend for Trixy in the Future
This guy has math numbers flooding through his head!
I watched this so early in the morning I watched it like 6 times
Do you think you'd be able to port this over to Bedrock?
Boys, get ready... we're goin' to mexico...
that mine looks absolutely EPIC! I can't wait to explore it. You are doing a great job!
So I've got two ideas that maybe would be kinda cool:  Firstly, the snowy mountains; I know this seems kind of out there, but maybe a society heavily inspired by Greek or Roman society. Think in the likes of Mount Olympus, just maybe a bit snowier than usually portrayed. There could be a dangerous ascent to the city of gods, with huge statues and other Greek/Roman architecture made of marble or the likes. The ascent should be very difficult, with parkour sections, pillager camps (that are also trying to make it to the top) and powerful mobs with ancient and powerful equipment. At the top, the city of gods await you, with beautiful architecture, libraries and telescopes (as the Greeks were very ahead and sophisticated for their time in history) and of course a colosseum, which if you manage to be victorious, you should be rewarded with a powerful trident or maybe a netherite helmet as it looks a bit like a roman soldier's helmet. Maybe the entrance to the end should also be here, as this is clearly an endgame area.    Secondly, the savannah; an underground society, inspired by the simple prairie dog. They hide underground to protect themselves from the dangers above, mainly ravagers. They are inspired by African tribal-society, valuing the hunt more than anything else. They therefore consist of fletchers and butchers, but their shamans(clerics) also have immense proficiency in potion brewing, as this connects them to their gods. Taking part in their hunting rituals, you could be tasked to hunt down and claim the trophies of certain mobs, rewarding you maybe a bow of some kind. For their architecture, I was imagining of course traditional (or exaggerated I suppose)  tribal-inspired décor, like totem poles, clay idols, clay paintings and exotic animal skin. The layout could maybe be inspired a bit by skaven undercities blended with The Sunless City from Outer Wilds, of course a tribal aesthetic instead of skaven or nomai.   Hope this at least can be to at least a bit of inspiration!  :D
i love the new legend of zelda breath of the wild map
Are u going to do the Nether as well?
for the tudra biome you should do a viking village
It’s looking really good so far! I can’t wait to see the Mountains!!!
I LOVE YOU
I cant wait for someone to make a survival series in here
Will there be a bedrock download?
Could you make this free and for pocket edition when it is done. please
the masa is so big i think its the oldest one
Now we’re gonna need an ultimate programmer to make an ultimate mod for the ultimate world
Maybe in the jungle, u can add some swamp places
i would have started with the railroad then added at least 2 towns, one bigger one smaller. towns in the west usually showed up as the railroads got built, and almost always on the track's paths
Been waiting! Can’t wait for the next!! Great job
not an idea for the world, but for the merch. could you make cases for samsung devices too? as far as i can see, the only phones the cases seem to fit are the iphones, which are muck thicker than samsungs. if you use this suggestion, thanks!
u r just awesome man. This Project is bigger than anything somebody will ever see.
Imagine running around with your horse in this map🐎
add horses in mazer biome
in one of the colder biomes, you should do a Viking theme you could make some style of a Norse church there's a lot you could do   more ideas Viking ship longhouse bustling dock plenty of iron to fit the theme  a mystical creature or monster  a kings throne room abandoned battle with crashed ships
That's amazy
I love you r vids but the hotel in the town should be changed to a inn a inn is for travelers
I wish I can play but the only device I play minecraft on is my Nintendo and I don't have an account on it sadly
"and other realms to upgrade..." Wait... Does that mean...  THE SHREK DIMENSION?!?!?!
Can't you with some command make it so that the mountains have ores in them.   Whould be more fun. Tho i understand if its too hard to do.
Do Vikings for the snowy mountains
Can you make the world download free
"To elevate your minecraft experience"  Also TrixyBlox: You can only get it by paying money
Add a mega tree or something in the jungle biome.
I'm concerning that the likes decreased more and more.
That reminds me of the saloon from dbd
Anything do with vikings would be really epic. Nordic stuff
For the desert you should maybe add a pyramid that wasn't finished by the Egyptians
Will you make also underground and caves incudimg doungeons?
Wow that guy sooo fucking talented in … playing minecraft? But keep doing what you’re doing I’m so exited for the whole pack
this is so insane honestly im so hyped to play on this world
early
It would be cool to have the mountain area sorta based on Japan, would include a new temple and a new tree type to change it up a little, not to mention it would be cool to have a different architectural style
I would like to see an ice castle (kinda like that castle from frozen were it was on a cool angle) and an snow/ice monster or dragon. That would work really well for the story telling 😊
Peaky blinders style?
Holy crap he posted
here's an idea for the mountains, instead of making one giant central village, make several tiny ones to represent tribes and nomads wandering through out the mountains, and instead of elaborate hughnormous places of worship make small shrines, and who know what could lay in the icy caverns, frozen, never hoping to see the light of day.
Savanah and tiga
When you get to the snowy mountains (if you do them) I feel like it would be really cool if you did wooly mammoths frozen in place scattered across the mountains
adding in an abandoned camp that a foreign tribe lived in, in the taiga biome would be so cool also this is just amazing :)
The amount of detail on your builds is insane, whether it'd be a large build such as the track with the support underneath or the smallest cart of TNT with tiny pieces of dynamite! Well done on this one, you've outdone yourself! 👏
The only series i look forward to watching on youtube, is TrixyBlox building this world ;-;
I play bedrock so how will I be able to play
The Mesa was always my least favorite biome.  However you have done a great job making it its own unique landscape and giving it new life.  Well done and keep it up.  Cheers!
You should work in the snowy biome next I think you should do a Switzerland vibe and on the tall mountain you have a tale of a yeti that roams there you should also add frozen waterfalls and a Switzerland town and a icy fortress filled with unknown people that hate the town. In the pine forests you should add lumber camps and  some fairytale houses in the forest. There should be some  icy caves in the mountains along with some abandoned mines anyway hope this gave you an idea and I  can’t wait for this to be done
I think the saloon counts as a place of worship for the residents of the village.
i need a 100days survival series where they follow the lore
Finaly part 5 is here!
I know you have your hands full with the building but what if you put in NPC's to make it an actual RPG-like game. Then when more players join it could slowly turn into a player-driven society. I know it would be a lot to make NPC's but maybe you could ask some other people for help. Just a suggestion. Keep up the great work and I can't wait for the next video!!!
Will it be on bedrock
Is it just me or is he muted at the end
imagine somebody believes that he stops the project just because he didnt hit the like goal. he worked on it for many months now so he wont stop because a stupid like goal
Outstanding. Simply a shrine of amazement. THIS DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE FREE!
Would be cool to do one of those Minecraft Civilization Experiment on this survival world
Is this playable on bedrock edition because I don’t have java
Hiiiii
A Hindu temple maybe Indian one plz
*Cough Cough* For the snowy mountains you should make an ice castle. *COUGH COUGH* Once you do it anyways.
Just watched "For a few dollars more" ; couldn’t be better timed ! That mesa looks absolutely amazing !
Why Are your Videos so short, you spend so much time dir a 15min video. I like your videos, the Musik is so relaxed.
This gave me read dead redemption vibes, really well done
I’m not sure if you’ve done this already but you should put a parrot in a cage in one of the mines like it’s a canary in the mine
Nice
It might be a plan already but a Viking village would be cool
Is it just me or dose the mesa town look like a really nice version of the hypixel murder mystery map gold rush?
I want to see, in the future, an official Minecraft series based on this map
Watch it on 7.50 speed. It feels more relaxing and lasts longer
how do you only have 2 milion subs? you deserve like 10 times more
when you do the mountais can you make a monastery for monks since that where they would probably live
Can you make a skin pack for the world?
when's the next episode coming out?
I was waiting so bad for this one🙏❤
Keep at It you are doing great 👍
how many biomes/ parts are left?
Idea for one of the colder biomes.  Have a steam punk city built around a generator  Based off of frost punk please.
Just amazing, congrats on 2 mil trixy
Will this world be on a specific version of minecraft?
Yes, this is where we've all been waiting for
I love these videos man keep it up
for the next The ULTIMATE Survival World episode, make the snow biom like in the series Game of thrones theam. ps The winter is coming.
I cannot  wait to lose all my food walking  all over the island
yesyesyes
I would like to build this on my survival world 😍
Hey there, I have a question for you. Since this is a survival friendly map, how is regular mining going to be handled? If I am to start digging down in the plains biome, will I still be able to find coal/iron/etc? Thank you
It looks like Breath of the wild, but as a sandbox game! 👍
Can we get a bhuddha temple high in the mountains of the plains
This is one of his bestest build so far
the Wild West town is just the spawn area of a GTA Minecraft server
Team up with black plasma studios and get this story animated! (Either as one big story or a few shorter one offs about each biome)
The Mesa feels so much like red dead redemption now, which is amazing to see in minecraft!
This is spectacular, I just think a clock tower was missing but the rest is really amazing
1M special got u double  XD
This is genuinely amazing I don’t know how you do this
Trixy, your always rhe best at building Improves my imagination
i would like a viking civilization and viking ships on the ocean near snow biome. like an village with the docks and the houses and the ships
thank you so much for this. youre giving us the update weve always hoped for😭
Brother you are from the space you are not normal human man just answer me how…?🤩🤯😳
Just saying but you forgot the Horse stable
Will this work on my ipad
I’ve been waiting to play this for so so so long!!! I know it’s gonna be worth it
Will this be available on bedrock?
yes, Yes, YES finally!!!
you are the most underated builder and mc player/youtuber, even with 2million you are still massively underated. you are the goat🐐
Tbh i really like the mesa the most so far, just suprised there isn't a big farm for cows, pigs, sheep and horses like most wild west games have
Here's an interesting way to write the tundra and pine forest biome: Maybe, long ago, there were two warring tribes in the pine forest, and a peace loving tribe in what is now the tundra. Both of the tribes in the forest saw the pacifist tribe as an easy target to get resources.  The peace loving tribe, who's now fighting a defensive war on two fronts, goes to the witches in the mushroom forest to beg for a way to make the warring tribes leave them alone. The witches use a powerful magical blizzard to freeze the area around the peace loving tribe to the point of being nearly inhospitable.  Now many years later, the survivors of the blizzard live as nomads, traveling around the tundra. These Eskimo-like people still hold on to the ways of their ancestors, but are very much prepared to answer hostility with overwhelming hostility.
Make an end city with an end portal (for the player to go to the end)
It is so amazing, i can’t wait no more
Well its about time!!! The last video was forever ago. I love this series, can't wait to try out the map for myself.
Me to
idea: instead of Christianity maybe a villiage could worship notch.
Heard you talking about "the wolf tribe", would suit to have a big baobab tree as a worship place? Since tribes worship nature and not as much gods
Make Judaism for the next religion
You should add Egyptian god (Isis, Horus, Ra, etc.) shrines all over the desert. Also you should improve wells.
Bro you may not see this comment, but I want to let you know you are an absolute legend doing this, I would don8 at least 100 to you but my parents exist
savanah should be more "nomadic" i think
You amaze me every time man. Fuckin sick
This is starting to feal like bran new game not a survival world
All i can say is WOW
YESSSSS  GIVE US MORE
i think its realy cool but you need to make a mod feachuring npc, that giant train ext...
Can you make it possible for bedrock to play this map?
4:06 because no wild west town is complete without good old "manifest destiny" aka stealing land and murder
am i capable to add any mods or the world it self has mods?
Me when I download this world when it is first release d: 😁😁😁😁😁 My computer: Goodbye
Great job :) (also a comment to help the video)
Finally!
Is the world compatible with 1.16?
For the snowy mountains make a Viking village please and thank you
Are you going to be able to play it on Bedrock
is this world gonna be patreon or free?
I think this world should have regional soundtracks as it would be so cool
Maybe for the snowy mountains you can do Buddhism or Shamanism and base it off of Mongolian culture?
i wish i could build like that
This is legendary!
do you have to pay to download the map?
I said it before and ill say it again for a cool thing to add to the snowy mountain if it gets a norse mythology build a gargantuan world serpet going in and out of the water around the survival world making it seem like thats the reason you shouldnt leave the island just close enough in view if you get close to the coast.
This dude deserves more than 2mil subs
I'm never going to be able to get it but when I can I'll probably have made my own
What about a farm to get horses?
i get so happy when i see these vids in my subscription box :D
I only have one word for it, amazing
Hell yea i love western builds this looks awesome i can’t wait for the next one
That is a Wagon not a Stagecoach. Stagecoaches are made of wood. It can fit 4-6 people inside 2-3 people outside & have up to 4 horses.
I have said this many times and i will say it again We need a frozen skeleton in the icey/snowy area
Fuck yes mate best one yet
We need custom bosses for this map. In mess some cowboy guy would work... maybe a "evil legend" the "Undead Golden Tooth"
I really wanna play this world since theres so much stuff to see. You really put effort into this!
Got so many rdr2 vibes
I want it... but I don't want to pay for it... and I don't have money anyway...
hey impressive work there tbh...  are you adding ores and all them thing for it to be fully playable as fo survival map? really interested on testing this map such a piece of art
FINALLY
Will the sever be cracked ?
When you’re finished you should have it so that you can buy land and build a house or buy a house with some type of currency that you can get
I wonder if you can play this map on mobile when it is finished 🤔
It would be cool if you installed special mods for new Ores, weapons, and mobs 😊
As a person who lives in the west this is a pretty good looking town. Now for a history lesson. The town TrixyBlox built would be called a "boomtown" these towns were usually setup near or right next to the railroad. They also set these towns up that way they can the resources. These were commonly mined materials such as gold, silver, iron, coal, lead, and other materials seen as viable at the time. These towns would appear at almost at random simply BOOMING from nowhere. (hence the name boomtown) Now of course if you set up a town simply because it is close to materials and its the only reason the towns running then the town will likely end up dead in a few years. Some find other sources of income such as Phoenix the capital of Arizona. They survived by using the rivers and dams to make the land there farmable making it sustainable and hence it lives today. But some boomtowns would have survived cause they struck it lucky, a good example would be Silver city NM. The place was originally made to mine silver that was in the area. The main reason it still stands today with a healthy population is because the city is still mining materials (just ask my grandpa) although ironically finding silver is no longer happening and they instead find other valuable material.  And to those wondering why people whore leather in the west and its burning deserts its because it stopped plants to (if lucky) even some animals from going through your clothes and into your skin. Though the average person wore something a little bit lighter on the chest area that covered themselves though. Light soft material kept the sun from hitting yourself and this would stop you from getting even more hot.  If I made  any mistakes in my history lesson please let me know!
For a place of worship I'd love to see a Mandir. I've only been to one, but it was incredibly intricately designed and still one of the most beautiful places I've ever been
Je suis fière de toi Trixy je suis fière !
this is epic! where's the volcano though
Do some giant caves under your map with some entries connected with each-others plz !!  PS : You are doing an incredible job, continue like this !!
U gatta pay to play this or it's free??
I think a really cool place of worship for one of the snow biomes would be something like Stonehenge. No buildings, just rocks with engravings like runes in somewhat of a circle with an altar in the middle
For the tiaga biome I would think it would be cool to be like a monster camp where campers once lived
This is soooo cool
You will probably not read this but you should make a server with this map, where you collect loot and fight others!! or a RPG type style. would be loads of fun and i’m sure people would play it :P
😍
Please do the tundra next
Upload upload upload upload
Could you add a boss and the parts of the co ordinates are found in each biome and the loot could rap up the stories/ lore
10:48 OMG this was a shot of nostalgia !
I really hope the next video is online soon
I can't wait to play this
To be honest he should get the winter biome done for four2022
It would be cool if Theres a Dalorean AS Back to the futur reference
TrixyBlox x Grian collab anyone?
It would have been nice if he added a second village or something to add more train stations so the big track wasn't as pointless
goodbye gyro zeppeli
for the taiga pleas do something viking related
This map should be put in with RLCraft, but without all the monsters haha
Will there be special mobs or creatures?
COOL ASF!
looks like fortnite map
Omggg
stables
I can't wait for the finished product of the entire island
Can't wait
Will it be out on bedrock? 😁
Wow
The dedication to this world is honestly mind-blowing
dude you smashed the like goal in an hour
stop inspiring me to start building again
This world needs a modpack too!
Trixy should do a middle earth build
the only thing rarer than deepslate emerald ore is a TrixyBlox video shorter than 20 minutes.
"...and other realms to upgrade"  WAIT WHAT!?
you should’ve added a livery stable to the town
will you be recreating the nether as well?
Another wonderful masterpiece of a biome keep up the good work trixy
Hey Trixy. In the Masa(probably misspelled that) biome, could you possibly add that rock formation from the Cars movie? Also Since it’s sort of western themed Where da OIL!?
Any medieval, Viking, or colonial, themed builds would be cool. Maybe in the forests do Viking, near the water do more of a colonial and mountains medieval. Mix of everything. And it’d be cool to have a bit of assassins creed vibes.
When I saw this in my notification tab I gasped and yelled " *Y E S!* "
hello
Will this be available on Xbox or just pc
I'm so excited!! Can't wait to play the map for myself. This was probably the best episode yet!
I am acctually really curious what your gonna do to the underworld and the ended dragon place, and all the rest, u working hard so claps of hands I can do for now and a like *I already follow u*
the railroad tracks are a bit too large in scale, imo. but other than that it all looks amazing! 👍
please put these guys together with a biome/structure modding team. it would be gorgeous
This map is taking sooo long but it is soo f'ing awesome to see the world slowly transform !
Buddisum
ive always wanted to do something like this but i dont have the skill or the time or the skill or the time and did i mention i suck at building and oh yeah i have no time
You can make a underwatervillage
The western area is until now my favourite! This is an insane project. I love your details of the buildings
What about the ocean
I've don't play Minecraft often but I'm considering returning to it once this map releases! You and your partner have done such an amazing job with this, its hard to believe all this work is done by two people.
How about a giant underground dwarven city? That would fit for some lore
Smash like or I smash you
Can you do a datapack with this things
Please tell me you can get a cowboy outfit at the leatherworker
This is gonna be so dope to play! Can’t wait to have a Minecraft survival world with a real story.
For the snowy mountains. Try make a hidden area which tells the history of the world. Try say there was a war and things like that.
OMGGGG
PLEASE ADD A HAT STORE IN THE TOWN
When will be able to play on this mc world?
Add marty mcfly and doc Brown as well as the time mushen.
Can you make a fox shrine in the artic biome when you transform it pls. And thank you for your constant uploads.
Claim your here before 1 million ticket
FINNALYYYYYYY!!!!!!!
I'd love to play the map its just annoying I have to PAY
Do the nether and end please
Im a bit sad there wasn't a place where they sell horses
RDR2 vibes just came back to me
this man will get a cape from mojang
I hope there are any lush caves who agrees
Ive said this on the other usw vids, but please make a stave church in the mountain or taiga bioms! Please..?
imagine if someone made a server with this map that would be amazing
I've been legit waiting for this video for forever lol
Jeracraft got real quiet when this dude dropped
I went nuts when I saw he uploaded again 😂
I know u probably won't see this but you please remake the legendary floating mountains  of pandora from the 2009 movie avatar
This world is 500 billion times better than my world that I have doing for 5 years, keep up the good work
What if the Tiga had a fairy circle for warships?
3 more left!
Bedrock map of this, pleASE
Okay but here me out….adding some power rails on the train tracks so you can minecart everywhere🧐
It's incredable to sea, how much talent and work, he puts in this world
I gotta say this looks absolutely great and this survival world will revolutionize Minecraft in a different way
This is literally so impressive
Is this for bedrock to?
I'd like to see dream beat this :)
Finally the new one
This is going to be soooooo big! I love it!
Make a little budist Temple on top of a Mountain
For the snowy you should make a ice yeti or dragon 🐉 if you want
You build like a god and have amazing lore I wish to soon be as great of a builder as you
YESSSS
No horsestable or something like this?
Can I play this on bedrock when it's done?
Is this only for Java? Or is it for Java and bedrock?
Hey Trixy it would be nice to have a mod (OPTIONAL) u can download so when you plant saplings (or whatever they’re called I forget) to grow into the trees that you spawn with at the start (AKA you’re custom trees you built for the “USW”) and other mods like that so when you try to play this like a story mode it’ll actually feel like a story mode, just thought it would be a nice option for people who don’t want default trees and other default things when you play
If you emphasise the fact you do it with one other person and it's a lot of work, why don't you involve players to help who are good at bulding for a much sooner release?
Looove your videos, you're both so creative
Amazing.
You should add farms and butchers
You should do an episode on the caves maybe using some of the new blocks while making huge dungeons to give a new experience!
The name wolf tribe I feel like they deserve a pagan worship area like Stonehenge or a acropolis
a sort of buddhist monastery would be incredible for one of the mountainous biomes, like the ones they have in the himalayas
ELOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Damn, i;m playing red dead redemption 2 lately, and decided to start work on a wild west town in my world soon, this video is perfect!
In the Mesa you should add lots of ranches
Honestly..... this series is a bit sus. the isle looks like an amoggus.
Like
Awesome video, you deserve more subs
Please put it to minecraft map
I really love this world and the amount of detail is amazing but I kinda feel like a western town with a railroad does not fit with the world that’s built. The rest is medieval theme and it kinda took me out to see a train. I think a village kind of like the Dothraki from GOT would’ve been pretty sick, but I can’t wait to see how it all fits together once I play it.
COMMON GET THOSE LIKESSS!!!!!!
I normally quit a build like 2 days in how do u do it man how?
What happened homeboy was like 2 months
@TrixyBlox   You probably won't see this. But, for the snowy mountain biome, I'd like to see an old hunter/trapper cabin. I actually have my own lore for this.  The old hunter that owned this cabin made his living off of hunting, trapping, and fishing, and also by selling his goods to the neighboring village. One day, he received information regarding a beast that lived in the mountains. With bow and traps in hand. The old hunter made his way into the summits to hunt this beast, but he never returned. What happened to him? Did he take the beast down, or did he perish and the mountains consumed his body? No one knows to this day.
I wish I had half the talent this guy got! such awesome, an all his builds! great for role plays too. I really cant wait to play this map out (though granted the longer he spends building this, the better it'll be! just please dont over work yourself dude! and (not as common these days as it use to be, but go out side once awhile and get fresh air lol)
I really like this world!
Estimate When do you think the savanna biome will be out next year??
Got to say as a railway enthusiast you have done a fantastic job building the rail network and the locomotives.
Would the world download be for bedrock too?
I honestly feel that the video has been to long on the way. It took you two months and you were two people. It agree that its a huge project, but get real, with worldedit it can’t take two people two months. To be fair you only did 3 things: train tracks, western town and a mine. If I was full time on this I reckon I could do it on 1-2 weeks.. however it’s a great video after all, I’d just love to see more content. One of the best builders on the platform👍
You are an amazing builder
can't wait to play it, i think i will make a survival series on it on my channel
Can we just appreciate on how much effort he is putting in for us so we can play and AMAZING survival world.
Omg this is awesome
Red Dead Minecraft be like:
Is there going be costume mobs
Your dedication to a long-term project is inspiring!
For the snow area you should add, ancient statues that represent a massive ice golem, ofc a frozen village made of snow, massive snow walls because of conflict, the walled can go with the mountains because of natural walls, massive mines, etc I can’t think that much
This is my favorite series on youtube. Always worth the wait
or steam punk wild west the term your looking for is cattlepunk
For the snow mountains you could do a cave system trap in some ice. Anyway, good luck for the end of this huge and already beautiful project.
You just made the state of Arizona!
If you could add a crashed metior that would be great!
honestly mate im staggered. you one-up yourself each time. so talented and creative, i cant wait to play it! i dont know much about this kind of thing, but will it be downloadable on switch? all the best!
is it going to be free?
Incredible! Though i would have loved to see some sort of western fort
You really are an amazing builder!
How will u fix the grief??
YESSSSS
what if Dream plays ManHunt on this world?
You can create a possible ice dragon cave in the mountains and the raiders  are feeding the dragon.  Put readers instead of raiders. Edit
Because of this series I want to play minecraft on my pc, but I don't know which version..
Maybe you could add mods so it is even better.
I don't know if it possible but I would love a buddhist temple.
The lore is very creative and nice. Good job Trixy!
One thing that is missing Are Tipi tents
I really think that badlands should have wild west style villages.
Oh dear... he created a train better than Grian's
You should add a marae, they are traditional maaori meeting places and they have heaps of cool carvings and patterns!
Wild West Town: **Was founded by outlaws for the outlaws** Also Wild West Town: **Established a sheriff’s department** Outlaw leader: *”I love hypocrisy!”*
Please do not stop! What you are doing is absolutly incredible and I can't wait to play your finished project!   Maybe for the snowy mountians you could have an evil queen who lives in and ice palace and controls the entire area, threatening the local peoples who have lived there for centuries. Maybe the witch has a connection with some of the other magic users in the story. Idk
He do you gona do sometink to the nether bekus you have a portal?
i dont care how much i have to pay for this im playing on it
Sick like always mate
Will this world be able to be played on pocket edition
BEST VID do mineshaft next pliz
I'm sad cause I really want to be able to download the map but I can't cause I'm broke
Love it bro! Also congratulations on 2 mil! ❤️👍😁
Get this to 250 likes common
I think looking into the Inuit culture for the trundra or some type of indigenous culture as inspiration for one of the biomes would be so interesting.  Their housing would be so cool to see. Cant wait for more ❤️
Gotta be honest, this map is so good that it alone makes Minecraft worth buying. This is insane...
Great video! If u publish this, is it playable on xbox or only pc?   Greetings!
😂😂usw In german: und so weiter [and so on]
Can you please put this on Minecraft store for people who can’t get it on your Patreon
i already know where ill build mybase at that third station without anything at it ill make like a sort of mansion or something idk.
I would like if made a Jewish community
I can't believe that this is in a block game
People are going to litter that TNT up as soon as they see it.
A modder should make mods for all the special villages and lore
Is there going to be a bedrock friendly version?
I just want to put some dirt in your eyes
Dude, this gets more phenomenal every time. It also kinda opened up my eyes to MC as a game creation platform. Mojang should make a unity style engine for creators that lets people use the block-scapeing to create game environments easier, just like the world painter thing but on many different scales. I think that for many making a game is hugely intimidating, but building a world in Minecraft and adding stuff afterward to flesh it out, (the simplified explanation of USW) might be just the catalyst they need.
Like everyone here I cannot wait for thia to be released. Though a two small ideas, you mentioned outlaws so I was thinking a pirates on a ship at sea. The other idea includes the Nether. I feel like some of the more orderly biomes didn't like the outlaws so some of them were banished to the nether.   I love your builds and I am really excited to see how it will turn out!! You have inspired me to start work on my biggest project. Thank you for the inspiration!!!
You've really outdone yourself... again!
always anxious watching these knowing the next episode isn't going to come out till the next month.
Will this be available on pocket edition?
You forgot to put a stable
Minecraft 2: Breath of the wild
This project is just amazing, tho i am not a big fan of wild west themed buildings, it doesn't fit the medieval look of the world, but other than that it looks incredible.
Dude your building skills are insane (as insane as your dedication to this series)
maybe in the savannah you could make a stable
I've noticed that you forgot to ad the stem to the trains. 🚄
Is this gonna be on pocket edition?
How much is it to play on this well it should be at least 10000000$ I love it
thinking about it this map would be perfect for a Pixelmon mod game seeing how it has all the biomes for the pokemon to spawn
This is just..... WOW.... Just incredible, everything is great just wow
Yo the video was awesome i loved your great ideas. But I think you maybe Could have added a Big steamboat that maybe has a gold or something on it and maybe the bandits would try to rob it.
The dedication and he takes on each structure is insane
Like if before 1,000,000 views
Yes! I’ve been waiting for this!
Every video I see  your physical health decline lol.
No native indians...?
I have been waiting for this for a while now.
I was just thinking about this omg
Insane
Its really cool but the strongholt nether and end how are u gonna do that?
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
When your parents are too strict to let you buy USW and u don't get to try it because of thst
When you get to the mountains could you go for a buddhist place of worship
I think you should add a ruined/burned down native american village
please try to make a download for mc pocket edition! Cuz i dont have a pc or ps, but i want to play this world so bad!!!
Hey, after this serie can you build hogwarts? it would be really fun to see how that would turn out!
Yo what if there was a train wreck that got derailed during a train robbery
This has been my favorite biome you've done, I love, well everything, the detail, the Wild West aspect, it's just really breathtaking
In the Savanna you should make a giant lion statue as their god.
Idea: You should let your patrons play on this world on a server, and they would play in the factions that you have made for the USW, and then make a video about what happens!
Can you stream parts of the building process, I’d love to see you build and maybe learn a thing or two.
Bro imagine play on this with shaders and better graphics like it would look amazing
love you're vids!!!!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 .        don't do it                                      .. . .. . . . . . . . . . . .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
foarte tare ai o apreciere like de la mine😘
هلا كيف حالك ❤
I'm really hoping for a volcano somewhere in the map... maybe the Savanah?
The lore will be epic
Honestly this just feels like an adventure map than a survival world at this point, still awesome, but not soemthing I'd play in survival. More just fly around in creative etc
In the mountain biome we need a Hindu temple
IVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO <3
Can't wait to see people doing 100 days on this when it is done
Merry Christmas!! I know i’ll probably forget to say this later so im saying it now.
Now for the Antarctica I guess
Lol. XD cool
I wish i could play it but im on console:(
You should make a red stone circuit to push the train around
I was thinking that you would make an oasis in the desert
hyped!!!!
In the savanna I think it should have a lot of pillager outposts like it would be their hub. I think that'd be cool
Dragon Kingdom in the mountains
How cool it could have been if everything worked like in real life
You’re amazing!!! 🤩🤩
me too sword 4000  👍
For the icy moutains biome, i can really imagine an secret forge, deep below the surface, like the forge of Ornn in LoL universe. While the surface is a very cold and harsh environment, the underground secret forge is a hot place, surrounded by lava flows, fire and smoke, with a very ancient architecture like it was built by the gods themselves.  This forge would be only accessible through a very small entrance in a ice cave, or a staircase that starts at the top of the highest mountain. In there, you could find some very nice and enchanted weapons, maybe artifacts, armors, and maybe scrolls that could lead to some lore secrets?
I guess you should do a Norse mytho inspired mega build for the ice biome, it will give the perfect vibe for that place and it would be really cool
2 things for the railroad: 1. Either keep the stairs for tracks or replace them with anvils which are cantered and have a better texture and shape 2. Maybe create a small, descending minecart or rail siding down to the mines to collect and transport lots of gold and ore instead of using wagons
can you make a story to this world or a animation
Those are some gnarly turns!
Will I have to pay to get the map
This is absolutely AMAZING. these terrains need to get into minecraft. You’re such a talent
This is literally SO COOL!
In the mountais make dwarf castles
what mod do you use to get that pan. You do it in your videos and i want to start doing that in mine.
in the village u shold put pillagers lol
you should do a synogogue (Jewish place of worship)
But still its amazing with what you can do.
Religion ideas: Maybe some ancient norse-inspired stuff for the mountain areas or another biom, Shamanism/whitch craft/nature religions in the tiaga or showy mountains, maybe even a sort of chinese sun worthship old dinasty empire type religion. Idk   For the nature religion/shaman thing I have a Sámi type religion or native american in north canada type shamanism.   LOVE your stuff man, you're an epic legend!! Keep going, this is historic! :)
please make some viking village and other stuff like that for the taiga ans the mountains it will be awesome
I really wish this was coming to marketplace
The buildings look like RDR2
Question, do the railroad tracks work?
Will this be able to be played on consoles
dude you forgot a horse stable! Thats one of the main ways they get around!
pls also decorate the nether (:
This is just ridiculously crazy and I love it
Please add  Atlantis in the Ocean 🙏
Wow, this is really coming along amazingly! Can't wait to explore it in person.
I love your guys's builds! SO COOL!
Maybe you can also get some inspiration from Persian architecture? They have pretty cool windows and shapes
Will it be available on bedrock
dungeon
*Trixy:* Again, I won't spoil the interiors for you *Me, broke:* but what if I'm a broke child that can't afford it :')
this nigga rlly took 2 months just to post a 15 min video...
I love this series keep going!
Haven‘t watched yet but knowing it‘s good and giving thumps up
you forgot the jail and the fort of the army. can't believe it
Feels like a much more detailed version of the town from Episode 7 of Minecraft: Story Mode Season 1
This is god tier
are you gonna use the 1.18 cave update ? awesome project
Niceee
I'mma get pc just for this mod pack
you should like do a survival let’s play on this world, taking us through all of the adventures in the USW
ฉันรอคุญลงคลิปมานานมาก
He did not give up on us!!
I have an idea for the end if you plan to do it.  Take inspiration from the farlands and make the main island a fractured island that's being held up by amethyst crystals (or maybe the crystal growth caused the island to start to break apart)
For the snowy mountain if you could do a Buddhist temple I think It would be very good
I know this map is probably gonna cost some money but it's still extremely cool and i want to play it
For the taiga, it should be a Japanese themed town with a Shinto shrine as the place of worship!
Yooo much respect for including a gallows
There should be a crashed train along the tracks instead of one just sitting on the tracks in the middle of the canyon
Yeehaw fellas the badlands looks just as great as all the others keep up the good work par’ner
I really want to see a Shinto inspired shrine/temple in either the plains or the mountains. the architectural style is really cool and it drastically contrasts many of the other religious buildings and the styles used in the rest of the biomes
wow !, I suggest an indian campment
🤯
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS EPISODE AND IM SO HYPE
I could build this if you gave me 13 years
Love you're work. Keep it up
You need to make a video for people that will never play the map and title it spoilers.
This one has been my favorite so far!!! Good job, And good luck for the next one!!!
You could Use a train mod for the train Track
Best biome in existence nothing can compete
I do think you should had a rench like cowboys use to. It would really fill some space and give a more western climate. Hope you like the sugestion! :)
I think you should upgrade this railroad that it will be going on every biome
norse paganism religion for snowy biome please
Amazing! Can’t wait to play it!
You’re on one bro.
Please do an Isu temple in the snowy mountains biome. P.S: If anyone sees this comment, please make the same suggestion.
Now I wish I could play! Well done!
i waited two months for this
What does the USW on ur merch mean? Cause I’m German and here it means „und so weiter“ (and so on)
Nice :D
Merry Christmas partner
Please make (Hindu religion)Krsna temple in snowy taiga or snow mountains
Never in the history has there been a better builder than Trixy! Can't wait to play this myself!
Can you please do something like the ancient Greeks for the mountains?
This was cool at the beginning. I'm never gonna play this map so I'll never see so much that would be cool too.
When we explore the map in Xbox PlayStation Nintendo and computer?
the taiga
I hope to see changes in other realms and in the Caves
Could you show one interior of a house or something so the people that can’t play it will see your interior skills
Yeaaaahhhh new video
Why don’t you add A wild west gun mod
My I have permission to make YouTube playthrough on this map
it's so funny to see his hairstyle change as much as the world each new video
In the Savannah biome you should a Greek/Roman style temple as the place of worship.
Wow this looks amazing in video but I bet it’s even more epic in game, can’t wait to visit this in game myself.
It would’ve been cool if someone made a mod for the USF where you can interact with villagers and other things like in other survival games
Make a mega cave 👍🏻
Yooo, the Mesa terrain looks so cool!  It's like living in Bryce Canyon!
Am I the only person that thinks that the Wild West town is inspired by Red Dead Redemption 2 a lot? It looks like a lot like a fusion of the towns Roades and Valentine
Will the map be uploaded to the minecraft marketplace as well? (Bedrock)
Amazing as always.
This is incredible!! Are you also going to build something in the nether and the end? I would love to see an upgraded nether or end!
For the snowy mountains do frozen mamut
i love this project so much, your building skills are insane
transform the End
This is incredible, very good job! :D
This map is basically a mixture of Breath of The Wild, Skyrim, and RDR2, I love it!
when  this releases can someone please alter the map to actually function with like a villager/ npc mod a train mod and what ever else feels right pleas
ME TOO
I would LOVE to see some Orthodox Church in Taiga biom. I recommend to have inspiration from Russian Churches. They are BEAUTIFUL. And it would be good in Taiga, after all part of Russia is Taiga.
Trixyblox you could make a end aswell that would be the cherry on the cake
Wow. It's back again! And it's my favorite biome too :D!
I think that an ancient Greek style temple would be a interesting place of worship for the savanna
Is this available for bedrock?
Hyped!!
Idea 4 Future Video : Steampunk world year 3065
Is this the power of a god?
I think you should expand the railroad to go up through the Savannah and snowy mountains, then come back in a loop back to the Mesa.
i cant wait to see this
Holy shit
I need this map now
You should create a server where people can do rp in your multiple different worlds you built, it would be really cool! I’m sure a lot of people would play and it would just be amazing. If you do that it would be great!
We need to have a server I don’t care that I play on bedrock at this point
It looks like a croissant I love it
I wonder if this world will be updated with announced mangrove and underground warden city biome once 1.19 update comes out. Other than that, excellent job on this world. 👏
If possible, can you make the map download free and on both versions? Maybe it could be kind of like skyblock, or like an upgraded survival world. Either way, it would probably get a lot of downloads, and another idea would be this could be a survival games map, maybe even for MCC!
Try to have jewish and muslim worships places in some biomes
God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son Jesus to die for us and our sins on a cross and was buried in a cave and Rose 3 days later so ever believes and confesses with their mouth shall not perish but have everlasting life in Heaven.
This game has more hype than some major AAA games, just shows you how much of an expert Trixyblox is
Plus upload for free once you finally finish 🥲🥲
If only I had Java edition I'd def be playing this world
I am not gonna lie I am very excited to Play USW I am gonna Take permission from my Dad and Buy Ur Patreon to Play USW
Plz join hermitcraft
Even though this is a custom world, will it still have all the naturally generated ores underground or only the ones you've manually added?
yessss the mesa
So is this going to be free to play when it's finished
What about the caves
my mind:  wood can burn    my eyes : fire  my hand: flint 'n steel   (if u know u know)
Are you going to do a compilation  of all the videos you made after its done?
Someone should make a server with this map when it’s done
if you do the end (which isn't very likely) maybe you could make the dragon in a destroyed castle.
can't wait to see what you do with the rest, and to find the story of this world
Definately made my day better after midterms today.
Seriousley dude. Every time you upload one of this is so INSANE. The patience and the level of creativity you put into this is such... I don't know, is just incredible!!!!!  Your dedication is at another level....
I'm sorry, but what happened to your eyelash?
This is probably going to be one of my favorite biomes to explore in the USW! To me it feels like taking my two favorite games, Minecraft and Red Dead Redemption 2, and combining them into one. Love how the whole map looks so far and I'm looking forward to seeing it once it's fully complete! Keep up the amazing landscape design and story writing.
I think seeing an underground village in the mountain would be so sick.
At wich version will be the map? Did it get the 1.18 Update?
so, it's a real question, but do we have to play to download the map?
Normally, I never comment. But this build is amazing! I haven't played or watched Minecraft-videos in a while, but I find myself incredibly entertained and excited about the new episodes. Thank you
Your work is really inspiring dawn wow !
Makes sense why the new video took so long, great job I love it
Sheesh I'm so hyped that I'm literally shaking right now
Your builds are gorgeous as always!!  But, you mentioned a "steampunk wild west" and I gotta tell y'all about boylie hobby time, he has a wild west series which is EXACTLY THAT so if y'all are wanting more steampunk wild west you can check it out after this
In the savannah can we have a giant snake… maybe it’s the snake king?
Sad that only PC can get the world.
Imagine playing this with a gun mod, where the mesa is the only place to obtain them
To easy
You need to build a cemetery for your Wild West town!
I can only imagine how it will change when 1.19 comes out, I think he might create another island for a swampland or something
How how tf u using both optifine and sodium?
Pls tell me I'll be able to get this on my ps4
Just an idea, but wouldn't it be a good idea to get 2 more western towns ( copying the other buildings ) so that we can explore more towns... if u dont want to do this i understand. But great effort btw.
As I’m watching this, all I can think of is rdr2😂
For the snowy mountains Create small ice cubes and a big cave inside the mountain  The ice cubes represent the fallen humans who stumbled on the hillside.
If you consider upgrading the nether i recommend a giant remnant bastion castle and you could build piglin's villages :D
Can you make a replica of this Minecraft world for people that play both Java and pocket edition of Minecraft? Because if you could that would be amazing.
I think you should do the icy mountains next and I think u should do a castle
For the snow mountains you could make a crystal cave that was protected by a beast that destroyed a alpine village
Dose it cost money to download the map?
Plz add ranches to the Mesa and Savannah also please add some separate farms away from the towns in the other regions to see make it feel like it's more spread out unless centralized it makes a lot of sense to me too add some more homestead-ish builds and off the grid builds please p.s. it would be really cool
who else is going to explore this in vr with one of their friends?
This is the best gift you could’ve given us.
This will be the coolest Minecraft map ever... And it's not close!
Grian could NEVER
I appreciate you taking long enough that I was able to get a pc!
Mojang needs to hire you
As a long time Minecraft player. This excites me to no end, and I can't wait to play it even if it costs me a good amount.
Finnely, i saw the first video wen it came out. Finnely a nother one :)
*The embodiment of pressing the upgrade key*
Have you considered IMPROVING the NETHER and the END as well?
Fabulous job! One small issue though, I was hoping you would add some ranches and a couple houses spread around like where cowboys lived. Because other than the hotel and the one small house, they have nowhere else to live.
Imagine making a server of this map some time, with quests and loot! it would be awesome to populate the world so it isn't so barren
You should port this over to bedrock and put it on the Minecraft store
Please make an greek/romen tempel in the Savanna
IT'S INCREDIBLE, SPECTACULAR, AMAZING AND MANY MORE EXPRESSIONS THAT I CAN'T TRANSCRIBE! I really love your job and every time I want it more than this I point to the map for my NEXONIA DUNGEONS adventure server, but I'm poor TOT XDXDXD.  Recommendations:  - That on the surface of the entire map there is an entrance to a more realistic version of the generic dungeons of the vanilla minecrfat, only much larger and more extensive, since then there will also be areas where you can only enter to fight (IF YOU MAKE A ROLE RPG THIS IDEA WOULD BE EXPECTACULAR)  - Add some maglares or a small swamp at the mouth of the border river of the dark oak forest and the jungle, since it is a biome that would be somewhat necessary because of the subject of the slimes, the future new swamp frogs and another optional area for witch spawn  Personal opinions:  - For the next biome it would be good if it were the mountains, if you have plans for them, although it is very sure that it is;)  - The idea of ​​placing some scale trains on the map is spectacular, but as they are only decorative, MAYBE AND ONLY MAYBE! not having done them but as it will be a survival-adventure map, I repeat, MAYBE! just place the generic minecraft vanilla on the rails of the tracks that you made, in order to use common wagons and use them as a functional large-scale track system. EYE! I don't want you to think that I didn't like what you did. I LOVED IT! It's just my opinion and that's it, if you want you can just ignore it XD.  - I DO NOT know if you would like the idea, since it could even be a future project for you, but I will tell you anyway. It would be BRUTAL! that in the USM you will add in certain areas and in a very scarce way (since if it would not be much more work for you) one or another structure, combat arena or dungeon of Minecraft Dungeons itself. But as I said, it would be more work for you as well as it could be another great project for you (WE HOPE THE WHOLE NEXO-GAMES COMMUNITY THAT ONE DAY YOU WILL MAKE A SCALE MAP OF MINECRAFT DUNGEONS IN MINECRAFT VANILLA TUT)
I wonder if you would recreate the end and some parts of the nether
It‘s insane that you put so many hours of work in a 15 minute video! It's crazy how much effort there is in this video.💙
are the caves going to be 1.18? just wondering becasue it would really suck if they werent
Amazing work! A tiny addition I wish was in the mesa too, would be some cow skulls, like you always see in the movies.
Pls do chinese stuff pls
You really need to upgrade world to 1.18 and add lush and dripstone custom epic caves.
I love this series so much. It looks so good!
Amazing! BRB going to get cereal.
When i see theese vids i get exited
This would be really cool as a public server but greafers would destroy everything :( but it just seems giant for a small group of people to play
i’m watching this while building my custom mushroom village! this is so cool
Please dedicate taiga to some modern Eurasian city
I think it would be cool to see a Tibetan-Buddhist inspired temple in the snowy mountains
Yeeehawww. This was a good episode today pardner. Can't wait for yous to finish!
Damnit i wish i would be able to play this Map too :/ But kinda hard without an patreon account/credit card required for patreon.
Yess
It‘s just insane!
will you do the nether?
Have one question when this is done can I play it on Xbox or is this going to just be on PC
i will buy this even though im broke
Question: will this map be available for bedrock Suggestion: The mountain/ snow biome could have a Buddhist temple as worship place
Put a statu of shreksophon on the huiest montein plz plz plz plz plz
Best
It looks really great. What would you think about a steam punk shelter city in the frosty mountains. That maybe works on a lot of lava that is deep in the mountain.
hey Trixy, what about a hidden underground satanist temple under the big church in plains
This puts the Caves and Cliffs update to shame.  (The Caves and Cliffs update is still a major upgrade)
Since its savanah can i recommend the under ground churches of Ethiopia ? here is an example of it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBq_zOzhTqw
I was looking forward to this one
4:55 I would’ve loved it if the church was styled after a Spanish mission.
I really want to add some elements from the create mod into this town
wait but there is an acacia savanna village in vanilla isnt there?
As a Idea, Place a End Portal,
wow
Hi, how a can get this map? (Download link or something else)?
Imagine playing hunger games here
This just keeps getting better
Compatable with bedrock?
I remember when he started im happy how far this has come its awsome
Are you gonna be able to get this on pocket edition
you should build a viking village in the snow biome
I swear with ur builds you’d make an insane hardcore world
Bruh you started this long before I considered getting a pc it been so long I’ve ended up with a pc
.
the day ive been waiting for
Goodday
I wonder what he'll do for the nether
You deserve 100 million subs
Are you only able to play this map on PC ????
what about the nether tho?
How the hell do you build good
This is sooooo cool but i dont have java   :(
i am buying it
Please be on bedrock Please be on bedrock
That looks insane. I watched all videos of the project. I really like all of the transformations. The Mesa biom is for now my favourite biom with the big rail road and the gigantic mines. I really love this project.
Is this going to be a Java only or will it be playable for bedrock?
OwO
YEEEEESSSSSSSSSSS YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Russian Taiga. Russian Taiga. Russian Taiga...
Does anyone know if there will be loot in the chests?
Yo
Damn, I wish I had money so I could actually download this map and play it when it’s finished. It looks so amazing!!!!!!
Make it a public download
I don't know about anyone else but the only thing I could think of through this whole build was Red Dead Redemption 2 just me or anyone else 😂
YES YES YES!!!!
So exited for this one!!! XD
No one will see this comment so im coming out gay now
Thats so cool dude cant wait to play that map
Oh I meant that for the hypoxel chat
nordic skyrim mountains
Uwu
can you make it available for Beta edition pls 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 also someone give this man a reward for the greatest minecraft builder plss
PLEASE DO SOME JAPANESE STYLE TEMPLE IN THE SNOWY MOUNTAINS!
can't wait to play on this!!
So we have to pay for this?
This world is sick! But not the bad sick!
👑👑
My patience finally paid off
YES!! NEW ONE! I can't wait for you to make more of these I wish you luck with the rest
why the world is not free
why dont you join hermitcraft
Are you going to upgrade the nether?
Steel ball run
seeing how much spruce and dark oak there is. you should make an inter biome railway and shipping center for all woods.
Love yuo
you need a NASA-PC to download this world XD
1/10th of the like goal already 🤩🤩🤩
what about some asian-like buildings
You have maybe mentioned it somewhere, but I hope you will also do some caves now that you have 64 more blocks
OMG WELL DONE ON 2 MILL!!!!!!!    when I joined you only had 400K!!!!
Happy Holidays to everyone 💞
its a good series
Will this thing work with bedrock edition
Amazing!
Costumanimals
sick
lets go, its back
This series never fails to impress me and blow me away. The way you research and base aspects of the world on history is very inspiring!
This is gonna be insane ive been following the build from the start and I'm really looking forward to it
ooooooo my favorite part of this is the train
I love the red candles on the TNT blocks, his attention to detail 😍
Hey mom can we get RDR2? No we have RDR2 at home RDR2 at home:
Fun fact: this is TrixyBlox’s 69th video.  You’re welcome.
Love it
BRB crying at the club penguin build reference, thank u Steph 😂 😭
AMAZINF
This guy keeps on telling us he doesn’t wanna spoil it but man we are just here for the ride we ain’t gonna actually play it bruh
Will this be available to play on bedrock? It looks super cool!
commenting for reasons
No one’s talking about the fact that it’s 16 million blocks. That’s fucking massive.
Imagine the game crashed and it reset
One idea i got is that u may get some ppl with command blocks as hobby and they may figure a way to get the train's actually driving along the railroad. that would be like the absolute peak of this already awesome biom. additionally u could maybe add an selfmade recource pack with cutsom musi csounds and stuff, like playing some of the backgroung music when entering the texan biom
Maybe place little normal rail on big one so it's functional
it would be better if u didn’t put the letters on the buildings
Everyone: wow he put a lot of effort into this this is gonna be a good video  Me: why does the island thumbnail look like among us
You didn't put a bar. In A WILD WEST THEMED VILLAGE
You should try to bulid little hobbit homes in the Mountains
This is gorgeous. Took me back to the times where i played RDR2. This is my favourite one for sure!
Bionicle.
It hurts me to know someone is going to buy the map and then use it to make a free download
You should sell this as an NFT
Tombstone AZ is a cool place to visit(sorta boring tho...mostly shops) old tucson is a movie replica town that's way more fun! As someone from the north eastern US I recommend it 😆 lol
So good
I think it would be really cool if he added a crashed or underground space ship or alien ship and it being worshipped as a god by the natives to that biome as a cool small futuristic element to the island
i feel like this map needs a RolePlay movie... to many details, stories, mysteries its to much for a plain 1 player survival :D I LOVE IT
question, if you are able to, can you make this world available for bedrock edition? i would really appreciate it!
i have an idea! it doesnt really fit into any biome but you should make a  sunken city, a little bit like atlantis.
i wana c Dream do a few Manhunts on this map wen its done XD
Will there be ores in the ground so you can survive or do you need to explore?
The best Minecraft content. Legit.
Are these going to be for bedrovk too, or just Java?
I LOVE THE LANDSKAPING! but i phink the bridges destroy it just one would be so cool but here its to mutch can you PLS Change this and make it With tunnels? i LOVE the series and i was waiting for it long! big greetings from Switzerland!
You’ve done so good, just a random thought, what if the snowy mountains had a floating mountain on the center for lore or something
I wonder if you are gonna do the deep dark cities , lush cave and dripstone cave i think if they each had they own civilisation it coild look cool
This is literally the only Minecraft world that I will ever pay for and I am so excited for him to release it but I don't know how to download it to my PS4 yet so
I'm still shook with how this is looking so amazing.
so im planning a group minecraft server that will be similar to this to have some lore and mainly be focusing on development of villagers pillagers and the player
nothing short of awesome..i just love this. Idea: u could make a custome nether, like a small island with a custome bastion n fortress, nothing too fancy tho, or a place with a nether portal and customise the nether spawn, maybe do something in the end if u have an end portal somewere.  I must say, i m waiting to see the finished map, i already love it
when you release this will it be on bedrock?
TRIXY My brother from across the pond you and your girl are doing incredible work keep at it as I may have to join  Patrion just to play this world totally worth it in my opinion!!!!!!
It would be cool to have a large Castle in a kingdom
Fortnite copied you bro
let's all just take a moment to appreciate how much work TrixyBlox puts into his channel to give us a beautiful and immersive world to play on.
I wish that I could play on that world but I don't have java edition. I love this world!
Will this world be free to download?
I can’t decide which biome is my favorite he just keeps making them better and better
could you do like a cemetary or something
*Rdr2 house building theme intensifies*
What about the native American tribes
Idea: add a minecart railway on the train tracks so players can ride, you could even break the tracks if you like 😈. (create mod could make it even better.)
I just realized there is no mooshroom biome  I kinda sadge
I think to pute a ranch in mesa biome is a good idea
Imagine a texture pack so u can hear the music to the many topics like the western music at the end how epic would that be
Uh oh I smell java edition and me not being able to play this map
for the snowy mountain biome, is it possible to incorporate some Indian/Himalayan architecture and culture.
I think you should do snowy mountains next and include a little village that is scared of some "yetis" in some caves  in a mountain. Little do they know, those so called "yetis" are survivors from when somebody invaded their kingdom somewhere else.
Even though is is crazy i wish it was bigger
no way
Oh my gawddd this is absolutely beautifullll 🥰 I love it, you are so talented 👊
please also transform the nether and the end into extra maps as extras for the world.
In the Mesa you meet to put a movie theater
Its amazing how much patience and dedication this guy has, and how amazing he is at building! I'm so excitied for the world to be released!
Finaly!!! Thanks
To be honest this is too nice for it to be played in survival
Imagine if we didn't hit the like goal and he just didnt keep working on it after all of this.
A budhist temple would be cool
Do we have caves
We're so proud of your progress and efforts. I know everyone is patiently awaiting the final product and thank you both so much! It's genuinely appreciated.
Indian Temple
1 day. 23.7k
X
Those bridges and cranes were phenomenal! So well done
Are you going to add an overgrown
Trixy should build a Minecraft map for Ryan not Bryan’s Minecraft medieval movies
Finally it's back
You are doing  a realy good work, thank you
...
Please do snowy mountains next. I have a really good idea for a dwarven village.
When this map is complete, is there a way I could get it on my Xbox one?
Are you going to make a nether and end form of this project?
Q: is this mega map free?
You should make a video transforming the end and recreating the ship and city
this is just insane man
Will this be available on console(Bedrock edition)?
I really want a hellenistic temple... I'm not sure where it would be located since pretty much every warm biome has been built
Best series ever! Keep going!
We Need the Townhallwatch 🏎🚂
dude, if you combine this with the create mod and a server of friends it would be cool as hell
You should put a Back To The Future Easter egg in that biome since the 3rd movie takes place in 1885 with similar buildings
Minecraft need to hire u
The western city really gives me RDR2  vibes :D
This build is looking really cool so far I’m really excited to play this survival world when it’s finished
Bro you do pretty cool stuff but this merch is cringe mate. Despite my hate, great build again! Amazing!
Can you remove the custom heads from the Cactus.. they are not bedrock friendly and will turn into skeleton skulls when you download the map
i have been refreshing your page for this video
For the tundra you should do an ice castle
bro how do you know so much about history
I’m sorry but I didn’t need a close up of your ugly mug every two seconds at the beginning 🤢
I have a question, can me and my friends play this map on a server?
Whenever I see Trixyblox in my notifications. I suddenly feel pure happiness.
I just wish we'd get more frequent updates
I can’t wait to play this oh my god
This is so great
I absolutely love this series and how the map is turning out, one request tho you could add a couple cow farms and horse stables in the maisa? Or in some utter biomems? I think that would give the plain and open fields more use, all those cowboys bringing the herds around or some wild horses😁🤗
so hyped
It's very interesting and fun to watch him change everything. Then I found a russian youtuber stealing Oscar's ideas, it makes me really upset
Tiny tiny tiiiiny detail, back then I believe a hotel would be more likely to be called a hostel, I know thats so minor but I think it would be a great tiny detail to add
Well done  How is steph doing now ?
what about the caves? i think that would be cool to do
I take it the inter-island underground cave network you were talking about will be constructed off-video? You may want to add areas in the plains, desert, and maybe underwater where the cave network breeches the surface (or seabed when underwater)   also, you forgot the underwater biomes, the ocean temple, the underwater drowned spawner house/temples etc.
red dead redemption 3
can this pls be free eventually?
2021 amerikalılar için güzel bir yıl oldu. tanrı neden bizim yüzümüze gülmüyorsun?
This is so cool can i have 15,000 minecoins
The scale of this project is absolutely incredible! I really appreciate your range as a builder, it feels like you can build grand amazing structures in any style.
my life had lead up to this
thus looks so awesome! well done. can't wait to play in it
Before discovering TrixyBlox I had the exact same idea for revamping a survival friendly world filled with lore and things to explore.   Well, I guess I can just go ahead and uninstall Minecraft because nothing I could come up with would even come close to what this guy is doing...
This is insane. I was here when he stared and that's awesome
You should make a town that looks like old moscow
Or,d
This is going to be so cool to watch! Can't wait for it to come out!
this world is gonna be epic. what if there's gonna be lore? that'd be sick!
how will you make pillagers spawn in the outpost? (nice work btw)
Can you do that the savanna village is a Indian village or camp please.
Maybe a little late for this suggestion, but perhaps you could sneak a cheeky little minecart track in, on, or under the railroad that way it's actually functional.
Niiice
you are telling me this wont be free when it is released ???!?!???!??!!?!!?!
I absolutely love the absurd abuse of the campfires in these buildings
How sick would it be if Hermitcraft Season 9 was played on this map?!
I'm literally speechless, this is just awesome!
This series is the best Minecraft building series on YouTube! 👍👍👍 Just wow!
This guy is kind of a god to me.
This was the quickest one u did
cant put into words how excited i am to play on this map myself aaaaaarghhh cant wait cant wait cant wait
Lovely
I can’t figure out how to use patron
Aw man you soukd have made a part of the bridge exploded like in most movies and just for people who are running down the  track and are just heading somewhere
WAIT 1 HOUR AGO?!
The like counts for the next part are funny at this point because at this point he's put so much effort into this there's no way he can abandon it if it doesn't make the like goal.
That's it, Trixy and Steph are the King and Queen of Minecraft. Are you listening Mojang?
14:07 That straight up looks like a desktop background!
I just wanted to say that i commented an idea on the last video to the snowie mountains that i really wanted you to see! But yes ive waited for this video so i know its gonna be good!! >:D welp have a good day and i hope you see my comment!! (Please like if you have seen my idea and also want it to happen <3)
nice
pretty sure Hotels in that time were called taverns but idk might be wrong
Could you make it so non pc players can use minecoins for the map please?
Can't wait for one of my fav youtubers to make a playtrough of this map
Looks absolutely stunning. Fantastic work!
YES, FINALLY! BEEN WAITING MONTHS AND I WAS AN HOUR FUCKING LATE!
this map + better villagers that would be the best
Can yuo build A Templer for a ancient god as a plane of worship
damn
There is no God but Allah. La ilaha Illallah Mohamed rasulu Allah
For snowy biomes, you could maybe use orthodox churches as models for the villages
I just wanted to say merry christmas🎅 and greetings from the netherlands🇳🇱 (oh and would you like to do the taiga next?🌲)
this guy should make the vanila minecraft structures
Trixy, could you consider having the download for free on youtube? A ton of people (including me!) would REALLY like to play this, yet won't have the money to buy it when it comes out. You can still have people pay for it if they'd like to donate it (which I *KNOW* a lot of people would do) so you could still get some money from it
Ngl I’m a bit upset that Trixy didn’t add a stables in a Wild West town. Where would they get their horses from?
@TrixyBlox I think you should incorporate a train crash down either in the canyon or in the savanna and inside the train there’s gold and other precious resources on the inside with a note about a gang stealing a train.
you should have built a bar
I think that it would be a cool idea to have a small 'black market' of sorts, where villagers would sell weapons or arrows to pillagers in exchange for extra emeralds. I think that it could shed light on how little villagers actually cared about other villages that they did not know, literally supplying the things that will be used to kill their own kind.
now i am truly sad that i don't play java for this specific reason
The best
When will this come for download and which version
Do you also ubgrade the Nether and the end
i want this guy to hermicraft
An idea i had for the mountains is to make it into a cave in which the ender dragon is in/ the end portal is in with lots of dragon skeletons inside the cave, lots of really good loot and tons of mobs.
Bro, I'm going to PLAY THE HELL outta this map in vr
Yes yes yes yes, we got the wild west !!!! Gotta be my favourite so far :D it's stunning!!!!!
I'm think the Tiger Biome should be Nordic / Viking inspired
Cant wait till i can play this with my m8s
in the taiga or snowy mountains you can make a kingdom like erebor
This is so cool (:
We need buddhist temple on savanna
In this map or the next, I’d love to see a futuristic city build at some point
Is it just me or should there also be a stable in the village?, I feel like outlaws, gangsters and cowboys would of enjoyed having a stable in the town.
what i would like to see is a free download
Taiga does fit with Jewish Worship place
Tbh this should be a game on it's own
Do a Mongolian shaman cave for the savannah people it's a religious place of worship that the shamans looked after
Honestly trixyBlox is the MOST under rated Minecraft YouTube on the site hands down in my opinion
Everyone should like!
What's the name of the shader? Anyone please?
very cool this kind of work was done by one person it's incredible
Why would anyone dislike this? i mean like bruh
I kinda dont want to mine anyting and just spectate the world. Might even build something...
For the savanna you should do a like Australian Vibe i would love to se that!
People should do a SMP with this world
when people will be able to play in this map, TrixyBlox will become famous
Why there aren't any bars in the town?
Hello every one is going to call me stupid bit what is a movie series
I really love to see the tundra biome in Japanese theme
Take your time
You should have make a military fort like the one you can see in the American revolution
It would be nice if you were able to put Asian style Village in the future can’t wait to play this world
Will u upgrade the nether aswell
wow.... just wow
No offense, i thought you died
Это замечательно!
Jungle temple is giving me zelda vibes
16,000,000 blocks. Let that set in.  The garlands spawn 12,000,000 million blocks from spawn. I can’t wait to buy the map.
But, does any of the outlaws have a plan?
I'm absolutely in love with this world, the level of detail is just amazing!! It's a shame the download won't be public, I was rly excited to play in it. It's understandable though, keep up the great work!
The savanah had a tribe right? How bout you do some totems for each 'god' like rock, sun, and other various natural elements like the american indians
All this is incredible
I'd love to see some kind of Japanese town
2 months of waiting for a 15 min video IT WAS WORTH IT !!!!!!
walks up to tnt cart. inspects it. creeper blows up behind you....
I LOVE IT. Please Snowy mountains next 😍
If this will available to download only for patreons i swear
You should do a Hindu temple for the mountains ! It could be like Nepal
OH LETS GOOOOOOO
can we see temple in upcoming  video? pls💖
can you plz build this done before 1.2.2022
Can u add a dark place where monsters come from like shadow forest or something
Is this gonna be paid??
I don't think I'll ever be bored playing in it when it's finished
I think it would be cool for the snowy biome to have a huge ruin of castle.
I would recommend doing an orthodox church for the taiga biome town, due to the similaritie of the environment to Russia.
Dude, u and Steph r just crazy. Thanks for 5th part of this awesome series. Keep up this amazing work
I don't really see how we are supposed to be able to travel across 16mil blocks. Even the nether is 2mil. If it is a 16mil AREA that would be nice to have clarified.
Extreamly cool
This was the biome I was by far the most hyped for after you teased it in the first episode, and my god u did not disappoint this is insane
I know at least a million people have said this, but why can't Mojang hire you guys? You are some of the most impressive story tellers and builders that I have ever seen. That is a fact. You are a Minecraft genius.
Please, i have a question, will you put torches or lights scources in the dark places ? (I am french, so maybe its not good)
FINALLY
Well god damn you could destroy any low end PC with this
You are insane
now, I have one serious question... how is it that you have enough time in your life to do this...like..in my imagination there aren't enough hours in one lifetime to finish this whole map (which is, by the way, a-ma-zing) ??
wait...what about underground caves???
Sorry... Did I hear OTHER REALMS?! Bruh we are spoiled enough already
What version of minecraft will this be in? I ask because say you build it in one version and maybe update it along the way or not. Also just noticed congrats on 2 mil subs!
We can’t see dislikes but I am sure there are a VERY few of them
So I have no idea how downloading maps work, so my apologies if this is a stupid question, but will the map be available on console bedrock?
In the snowy mountains you should add the place from the grinch
You need to make a Slavic onion dome monastery for the tundra or taiga area
Here before 35k views
Not to be rude but do we have to pay to play this map?
We need farms and farmlands
this is literally nuts, i can’t wait to play the final map!
oh pleas dont burn out! be mindful with your psyche and body 🙏
You should do a collap with Jeracraft!
Omg finally new part can you do mountains next ?
worlds best minecraft builder right here
love your vids
Hello
You should upgrade the End
This biome needs a little desert bandit´s base a out of the town.
epic
and i get bored after one week of mc :))
U should add like a secret island in the ocean or in the sky and water temple  Or maybe like a giant creature skull and spine to add more spice to the lore Or even a vortex that leads to a secret ancient lost city ruins  I would love that u add like a mountain city in the middle of the wild west and train tracks all leads to that Also u should scatter a lot of chests, lore hints around the map
VERY NICE looks really good have been following this project and can't wait to get my hands on the map download
Can you put this on Addon?
Hey! I do have an idea for a church/place of worship witch is the Basilica Of St. Mary. I think the design is cool!
You should transform the nether too
Holy shit
The Mesa biome upgrade is now officially my my favorite so far. I expected it to go a bit towards the Wild West theme, but I must say they really exceeded my expectations. Three cheers for them!! 🤟🤟
Hello am i early ?
Can you make a datapack (helping with a datapack maker) that modify biome and structures in minecraft? (For structures you will "only" have to store structures you build with the structure block and the jigzaw block and for biomes, I never did that but I think it's a bite similar)
this Mesa biome is up there together with the Jungle biome! good job! cant wait to play your USW!
I’ve been waiting for this and it is just what I expected epic
Since you're doing it all, have you thought about the lush caves and deep caves/ruins for the Warden? That would be a blast!!!
you could put the map in patreon but without the buildings i think it would be good for players who want to build and don't know how to use world paint
lol this was a one million sub goal and you aren't even done making it wile you have 2 million subs
Will this be available on Bedrock Edition?
Minecraft will look back at this video 20years later and say, "Remember when this was godly? Now we can just make a world with the click of a button better than this."
question, are you planning on adding any cave biomes included in 1.17/1.18?
Minecraft:  New Vegas
imagine he made a structure mod
For the next place of worship, do the church of the flying spaghetti monster
Omg
Im not gonna afford it when it comes😭
Wow
Enjoyed this so much I wish it was on your level of building
Join hermit craft P
AND ALL WHO DON'T LIKE THIS VIDEO DO WE NEED THIS MAP WHEN IT IS COMPLETE
Are you gonna do a play through of this map? For those of us who don't have java like myself it'd be cool to see the secrets and storyline that you and Steph have included
Why not do different religions in different biomes
FINALLY
Sjskdlf i love this
This is basically Breath of the Wild x Minecraft
The details blow my mind, it is amazing 🤩
This is epic !!!!!
I love it
Maybe, you could make a special Texturpack give the wild west town some special villagers
This is the best part of the build by far. I love western builds. I’m really bad at building them in Minecraft but maybe I can take some ideas from you. And if I were “living” in this world I’d stay in this area alone.
Dude you're crazy! I used to play Minecraft alot back in the day but this might get me back playing it! ;D
I want to see the snowy mountain biome
wait till mr beast makes a 1 million dollar game of hide'n'seek on his gaming channel
Do the winter one next because it looks Christmasy
hell yeah been waiting for this
Last night I was like damn its been a while, you were a day too late
This will be great survival and adventure experience for all of us
when it is done are you going to do a little survival roleplay on this so it will be cool and make some custom weapon skins so when the swords' from the stone's come out there real weapons even though there not
Can’t wait to get the world download when you’re finished, I’m pumped!
Wow. Amazing builds as always
this world is gonna be sick when its done
Can you add Samsung galaxy a 32 phone cases to the merchant store
wait, did you just say download it along with my patrion.... its not free?
Thank you for everything!     This commend is mainly for the alg04ythm
Great job! Will it be free to play?
I think a Himalayan monastery-type building would be cool in the mountain biome.
Yessss!!!❤️🔥🔥🔥 Finally!!
Nordic mythology next biome pls Edit: it might fot best in The snowy taiga i forgot if you did that
ooooo I really hope the railroad tracks are usable, that would be so cool!
Great vid!!! Keep this going!❤
i want to play it but i can't ;(
Daim I love your Videos. I hate that it takes a while but that is the price for your absolutly beautiful buildings but there is one thing you've could had make and that's a second village and both villages have like one or two things that the other don't and there then there were a big fight between the villiages because of resources. But even thought this ist freaking great. Keep going so I can enjoy this my whole life
YES been waiting for this one since it started and you did not disappoint, especially the train build (I love trains BTW), very surprised you went 6-wide and there are certainly some techniques I saw that impressed me.  And because I am such a train nerd, the "Coal cart" is called the "Tender", had to say it =P
What version was this?
Hi
Is the map available for bedrock edition or do i need java? I just want to confirm b4 buying the map
Man I wish we could play it Skyrim. I would love to be able to walk into the saloon and get a quest from someone asking me to go to the mines to get something for them!
greek
Will this be available for bedrock?
I have a suggestion/ an idea. Maybe you could combine the korean, japanese or chinese culture with the taiga biome? I would love to see your style with them
nice
0:40 nether upgrade confirmed?
Is this made using vanilla only blocks?
I'm speechless 🤩 Like holy shit i can't even build an cool house, not even an villager house 😅
This exceeded all my expectations
I will sport you
can you do a tribe a hidden one to be exact they have secrets that no one know but they have a grate tallent at herbs or weapon making or like a hidden box that has book that change every thing   hiden box in a hidden tribe sownd nice
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻
Me after finishing my ugly bridge over a small river: Let's go, I am very good at building This dude after making half of an ultimate looking 16x16mil block map: *calming*
u better put little parrots in cages because they used parakeets to see if the air was safe in a mine irl
I feel like you could easily make a calendar out of the builds/scenery in this world. And I'm sure people would buy it.
Put a hindo temple
The master of building is back
Your awesome 😎
those train cinematics with the music is better then what back to the future could do!
Supongo que no se a pensado en traducir la historia al español o soy el único habla hispano. Aunque su trabajo es grandioso
Yet another mindblowing and amazing upgrade. Cant wait to be able to play this. Keep up the good work!
Do u make the underground and mountain 1.18 capable?
I would love to see a Norse inspired culture! Especially, with a nautical aspect to the society just like the Viking Age. A pagan/heathen temple would be great too and maybe use architecture inspired by the Stave Churches found in Norway. Oh, and please add runestones throughout the biome. Either taiga or snowy mountains would be fine.
Congrats on 2 mil by the way my guy! I remember when you were closing in on 1 mil! so happy for what this project has done for you and super excited for this world to finish!
Trixy s finaly back to it
You should make one of those mini things on the tracks so if a train gets stuck the miners can go retrieve it
The towns layout reminds me of Valentine from RDR2
Can you download on ps4 to?
Nice, would be nice to finally play this when it's finished.
Awesome I just love me some western
Alexa, play red dead redemption soundtrack
plz dont tell me the only way to download this is by is patreon
pls man PLS MAN MAKE IT REAL MMO RPG  WITH CUSTOM WEPONS LIKE WANDS HAMMERS SPEARS AND MORE STUFF PLS I BEGGING YOU
I think that for the mountains you can do a medecin house
Do like, in the snow biome, a monk temple with like ancestral buildings, training areas...
it would be cool to see how a society would grow in this world. like if 200 people were thrown on there, how would societies develop.
I have no idea why, but this reminds me of New Vegas.
I'm just a little baffled that the wild west town doesn't have a blacksmith, a stable, a farrier, or a silo to store grain/food.....
Wait a minute there’s a movie series!!!!!
been waiting for this
Can you put some Japenese themed builds in one of the other biomes?
This guy could win every MrBeast building contest
The research that goes into each of these biome builds is so cool. I really love the little bits of cultural and historical knowledge you share with us!
Let's FUCKING go part 4
This is insane. I cant believe how this is not done by a professionell building Team with dozens of people
Holy crap- that's really pretty. You did great. Only thing I would've done differently was add a few things in the wild areas like bandit camps or something. But still great job
goodness youre like a SS ranked human
Taiga do pagan place of worship with an altar in the middle of the woods with goats lol
Don't forget caves, nether ans the end. It's a super and huge project ! Congratulations !
Le mese
I love it
Hindu
Before building everything you can upgrade Nether
Me wen i saw this: YEEeEEEeEEEeEEE
will this world be compatable with 1.18?
Worship a comandblock
In the snow baum, they could believe the nothern myhtology, like Odin and Thor and such
the whole town is amazing, but no stable for horses!
Make the taiga have a gothic build style! I think the White\black contrast will go well! you could incorporate the deep dark cave under the city. it would be cool if you made them like an occult that worships the warden, trying to revive him. you have a lot of lore possibilities
this series is basically  "i did some work off camera"  awesome work as always Trixy
You should do a helleni temple for a place of worship in one biome
best x-mas present ever :D
I cannot wait to play on this world honestly!
This entire series deserves much more support. Keep working on one of the biggest minecraft projects ever made!
Trixy: Water towers, were actually used to supply water... Me: Very interesting, who would have tought XD
Dude imagine if he added custom stufff like if the trains actually went around that would make this world perfect
Something that would be cool is if he made a mirror version of this world in the nether with all the nether biomes
i litterally checked yesterday for this, then next day he posts it, lol
I keep watching this and I keep getting ideas to add when I get the world like a underwater base that was destroyed
In mountains- tibetan style monastery village
yeah, there are RDR2 vibes
Idk which biome it will be in but maybe add a paganism based building for ones to worship edit: maybe the snowy mountains?
Nice
If you wanted you could add horse stables to this build but it’s just an idea. Love the project and I will definitely stay tuned.
I’m sad cause even when this is finished I can’t play it like I wanted to because my Java account won’t let me login cause of Microsoft after I updated it
sooo cool! cant wait!
Can you nake a cave also with all the new 1.18 biomes & features....plz so we can explore.....
IT'S HEEEEEEERRRREEEE!!! I loved this! Everything from the use of banners as signs, to the red candles as sticks of dynamite, to the way you never take the easier design paths and prefer to make sure everything is as epic as possible, is always an inspiration.
I love this, but why have you put mods? Us bedrock players aint gonna be able to play this now
"If you don't see it in this map, I'm sure you'll see it in the next."   THE NEXT?!
It just feels like a skyrim world
The best 15 minutes in a while
For the USW plz do a sort of Greek mythology building type for the next biome
Whats the map called?
PLEASE A POKEMON EASTER EGG!!!!
I am not going to destroy a single block from this map.
We need a Hindu temple in the next one
Ohh yes, 69th video let's go!!
This just blows me away! Your guy's work is amazing!👏
I have an idea: what if deep in the tundra there is a secret civilization of people who have a 1950's Suburbs style city, that is way further ahead on technology than everyone else!
Just when I think the map can't get any better
You should build a water outpost in the ocean!
id love to use create mod to make all the mechs and even the trains move, could be a cool but hella time consuming thing for the future
Hi!
This is honestly my favorite minecraft series ever, please dont stop midway if the likes dont reach 250k, it would kill me
YEYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
With the arrival of the 1.18 cave update, will you change the caves or add new features underground ?
This is so epic
I think the hotel sign should be horizontal like old 90s hotels
when you do the snowy Mountains make it like Wakanda
YYYYYYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG
Realy epic
will it be free?
we need a completion of this perfection.
I like how this released 35 mins ago and there are already 10k likes. That’s a good sign
Take your time for the next part. I can wait.
In the snowy mountain you should make a dragon nest
The nether
Can’t wait to see it
beg for more likes please.
Hope y'all manage to get a datapack for the story related stuff, such as unique items and tools
Mojang please recruit this guy
This is insane
I forgot about you man
Great vid. 😀😀😀Made my day
Ohh I’ve waited for you
Fun fact for those unaware, Mesa biomes irl are named after the Spanish word for table "La Mesa". Named so because the large rock formations and plateaus look like giant tables.
please make a end portal and the end is upgraded
Hey. This building fits exactly with "Xtrullor - wild west
"Arthur, my boy,"
Finally, another video
Lets go , pls let us play it by the end of 2022
I’ve been to the Grand Canyon and the terraforming reminds me of it a lot. You did an amazing job this episode, as you do an every episode.
New sub!
Does anyone know if there are going to be interiors to the village houses because I see a recurring theme with his older builds.
I hope Mojang makes this canon to the Minecraft story
Will you also upgrade the nether or end?
For a church you could use the Pantheon as inspiration (you know the thing in rome)
10/10
I have been waiting so long for this one.  You are literally the best Minecraft person on yt
It’s insane how much effort he’s put into this series. Huge thumbs up for you man.
how is that 16mil blocks I can see the entire map in full detail and for sure you did not make a building 500k blocs wide and thick
Fun fact: if u put hay pale under the campfire, the smoke will go much further in the sky, so this could be a really useful detail to put in the trains
TrixyBlox: Hits 1M yay! Also TrixyBlox: 2M and am (ALMOST) done :)
nice i get the notification like half an hour late
I wish we could use those trains
I just love watching all the upgrading going on and all the amazing ideas being presented!
So inspirational cant wait to play it
you may have asatro in any snow biom
Oh my gosh I waited so long it's finally here
historically trains at that time were private so they were all funcionall. passangers, prisoners, materials, all in one train.
Please do taiga / snowy taiga next! With a japanese or general eastern building style!
Damn the map kinda looking sus
will there be a nether/end upgrade...ik its alot to ask but it would absoultlly be insaine
These are absolutely incredible, the detail is amazing as well as the lore
The village kinda remembers me to Rango.
I was really happy that this series came back
Just imagine this world had the chisel mod Damn boy that's gonna be fire 🔥🔥🔥
Trixyblox - I won't spoil the interiors for you *Me who doesn't have Minecraft* - SPOIL IT SPOILT IT SPOIL IT
Finally
Yeehaw! As a Texan, I loved the builds in this. 🤠
no joke i was thinking earlier today 'huh trixyblox hasn't uploaded in a while'
I was actually wondering what mod you use to move and copy buildings, i use building wands but it doesn't seem to be effective as yours
For the snowing mountains you should  have a mountain with a costom stronghold
You deserve alot more subscribers SO MUCH MORE on how much work you do. (EDIT)  are you going to incorperate amethyst and more lush cave type of things in this world???
So cool well worth the wait.
Let's goooooooooooo
Yeah
Can you pls make a underground alien base in the snow biome
The build reminds me of the Tales of the SMP but better!
This would be really fun to play if you added the create mod into it to make the cranes, windmills, water pumps, and trains work. And/or you could add a mod that turns Minecraft into Ark, idk but I can't wait for the final product
I keep waiting for the snowy mountains, but DANG that mesa looks freaking epic!
Wow i just checked your Chanel after months and found out by surprise that you posted a video NICE 😉
Lot of people dies everytime in revolver duels,were is the cementery?
I don’t know how you did it but those chains made out of blacked out levers is very clever
You forgot Indians!
But not anymore
Can’t wait to fly an elytra in that
Again, for the snowy mountain biome, I’d love for the religion to be Mongolian Shamanism/Tengriism. It is a central Asian faith based on Khukh Tengri, the eternal sky god, and Eje, the goddess of the earth. Since we Mongolians are nomadic people of the Steppe, the snowy mountain biome suits this best. Thanks!
I was getting bored
I can't with until I can buy a good PC to play on this map,   вυт aғтer тнe wнole т2в2 нacĸer мeѕѕ  ιѕ ѕoмewнaт over 😅
After every episode of this series I changed my mind where I am going to live in this amazing world when it's coming out😂
I was waiting so much
What about us Bedrock players?
It look like everything is going so fast but it took months to make RESPECT❤
How about me I'm not playing Minecraft but I'm your fan I'll never see the interior 🙂
ive been waiting for this vid
Claim your here before an hour metal here if you want to download the map
Please do this for the nether
It's beautiful
Everyone like the video now
I was constantly checking TrixyBlox for any updates this week, and it appearing tonight made my evening!! Was worried with your progress over this project, but please take lots of rest if you need to. Good job as usual!!! <3
Well I want to see Indian style forts specially Maharashtra's forts
I really want to play this Map !
amazing job, you're a god builder but so sad that we have to support to have the chance of playing on it
can you do something japanese on the taiga or the mesa ?
Your video making me want to replay RedDeadRedemption 2
WOW I LOVE YOUR BUILDS AND VIDS!!! and btw your one of the best YouTubers ever
I litterally sat yesterday reasercing when you were gonna upload this video!
Your forgot a stable
Finally this came out i’ve been waiting for months
I truly cannot wait to play this!!!!
You're amazing!
i like how he says via patreon meaning its probably going to be a map you have to pay for. hopefully its not super expensive...
Amog island is back
oh my god its finally out yayyyy
it would've been cool if there was like a clock tower in the village like the one from Back to the Future 3
Really excited to play this map with my friend 😍😍😍
This has been long awaited, I love what you guys do!
Damn. with each passing episode, the ideas, the designs and builds become more and more gorgeous. This is simply UNREAL
nice
This video Will make my happy
I'd like to see someone make a modpack to go along with this world
i think a town hall should be added, im from a kinda wild west town in west texas and it’s a BIG deal. it’s kinda a meeting place for anything that’s happening. also a horse rancher, we have a single car dealership that’s way overpriced so we typically just buy one car par family and then everyone uses horses from the local horse ranch. lastly an entrance kinda of guard post. not that anyone is ever really in there but it serves as a “welcome to our town” kind of thing.
WOOOO
U should like make a ice dragon in the icey mountains a fire dragon in the Nether if u do the Nether
Sehr schön
7
This project is insanely detailed
I still can t believe it how much effort u r putting into this!
I think you should upgrade the mineshafts in the caves! That be sick! BTW if you don't know what I'm talking about, it's one of those mineshafts with the spider spawners and ravines!
Ok but the train bridges are STUNNING and make the canyon seem so much deeper
I want to see the snowy mountains biome next
Will the nether get some upgrades too? It'll epic traveling in the nether
Yeehaw
Does this world work in bedrock edition.?
It would be better to close the music in the video
Iam really excited about this project
I can’t wait to play on this map!!! It’s so beautiful and it looks amazing! You are amazing for making this
Why? Why is it that individual people can make minecraft exponentially better all on their own, but a massive team of people will take an entire year to give us a couple new items and a reskinned squid.
Can you download it for bedrock version?
NICE
Butifull
9:32 in other words you couldnt be assed to come up with another crane design
if its possible, couldnt you make a portion of the nether custom with the other areas blocked off by lava to make it look natural and barrier blocks so even if they used fire res they wont be able to get out
This is sooo cool, I think I’m gonna have to become a patreon🤙🏽🤙🏽
can you please do the snowy mountains next?i love your videos😋
I’ve waited 2 months for a 15 minute video? Sad times
The build itself is amazing but I’m more amazed at the amount of research you guys went through to bring this to life
Will this be on bedrock?
Let’s GoOooOo
Tbh, he should yave created a drug store because i feel like its classic wild west
Keep up the good work bro 😁😁
ITS BACK-
Wooooooo! Merchmerchmerch!  Also excellent builds, as usual 😁
A india  temple or iskon temple plss
HA like I play survival maps....also its not possible to make the badlands biome look good coz the color orange is an awful color..IN MY OPINION, nut this one is a little better. but honestly all I want is an Asian themed Biome
This thing was worth the wait
i acutally finish a small wild west town a couple of months ago with a little story of a train heist with some american indian huts nearby. i might go back to that build and use some of these ideas to make it look a lot better. can't wait to see the finished world and i'm excited to see what comes next.
Waited for this
I just got a new computer that will be able to run Minecraft really well so I'm super excited for this map. If you don't mind once it is out, is it okay if I use it for a Minecraft survival series?
5:22 make orthodox style church.
Broths ( and sister), this is totally gonna rock the entire minecraft world like nothing else ever. I very much wish i had the hardware to support this. Alas, my sons tablet won't even allow us to update beyond 1.16... Sad but we enjoy what we get all the same. Thanks trixy! Your a boss
This is once again incredible stuff. I cant wait to play this map for myself.  Just one critique: The brisges actually look very cool. I just think, that the whole track got elevated a bit too much, its basicly one whole bridge, which seems bit unrealistic.
It feels like Red Dead Redemption
Wake up babe trixyblox dropped
#TRAINS!!!
Let's goooo boyyy
This is my favorite Minecraft project right now.
Is this available on Xbox?? I don't have a gaming pc
Ya
We need the tutorial: “How I didn’t give up spending 2021 upgrading everything in Minecraft”
Are you going to do a build for the up and coming deep dark?
👍🏻
I really wanna see the taiga, and mountains as that it one of my favorite biomes, I just loves the " mountainy" feel of it.
You should add theirs to the Minecraft marketplace on bedrock
You should make a volcano cave filled with lava and parkor
i would love to see the tundra biome being viking inspired and with a Blót ritual cirkle maybe. looking forward to it
9:59 you should of made it to where there was something like a wall but it was wet and you could go through it and it was almost invisible and when you go through that wall if you can see the sky you can see the sun rise and set over and over with in a second. and peaple that was on the other side of the was was moving SO FAST because time moves differently on the other side of the wall. :)
The music at the end sounds so much like dune
it would've been amazing if this was made post 1.18
Ayyyy i was waiting!
Imagine someone hosting a hunger games on this
I hope MatPad will make a lore video about all this
YES!  I'm kind of early XD
Holy shi*
how will they get food
This has become one of my favorite building series on YouTube
Hey man will the map be compatible with foreged minecraft
imagine speedrunning this world, imagine how long it would take, or how short
Been looking forward to this so much currently have covid and really need something to cure my boredom
Yoooo, I've been waiting for this video for so long!
When you are going to make the snowy mountains you should add a pagoda and tori gates to make it look a picturesque japanese mountain landscape.
This is amazing!! Very cool do you think Vikings can be in the Snowy mountains  ??
Wow awesome build you guys 💪🏼😘you smashed it !🤙😍
How about a more traditional form of worship? For example the snowy mountains are very cut off from the rest of the world so may not have moved past worshiping traditional gods such as the Greek or Roman pantheon? You could include a Greek temple at the top of a mountain for a cool image and the isolated nature of the mountains would make scence in game.
You absolutely nailed the atmosphere! I can't wait to see it all done!
I want to see an underground ice dragon in the mountains biome for more lore and lots of different side quests about the specific dragon   Going great! I love your dedication. I bet a lot of people don't even realize how long this takes you. Great work, TrixyBlox!
The pillager outpost in the plains biome should be an old west style lincoln log fort!
Needs more subscribers :(
I’m really loving this series, one question. Are you going to include the new cave and mountain biomes for the rest of the build?
Yeehaw! 'Bout time we get to the Railroad!
This entire series is incredible, I seriously hope you and these viewers take consideration of the work in this. I cant wait to play this
I've said it once, I'll say it again: normally I wouldn't pay for a Minecraft map, but this one... This one I'd pay even $50 for.
perfect i am chockt
Bruh, imagine playing this in vr
A yeti cave in the mountains would be obvious so I'm gonna say something out of the box in the snowy mountains you should have a goat cult
Nice
Absolutely amazing !!!
GOD BLESS
WOOOOOOOO
Will this world be available on bedrock edition? I can only play on bedrock but I love this world so much.
Yey I'm waiting and waiting but It is amazing!!!
Savanna needs to be Romans, there’s just no other way to put it
Amazing ! !
You should build a gurdwara for one of the biomes
This is just so epic
ASK MCYT TO PLAY THIS
I can't wait in till is done 😀❤👍❤😀👍❤😀👍❤❤😀👍❤😀👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 Mary Christmas 🎄🎄😀❤
You should work with Bethesda
Mighty fine job, partner!
You R Insane 🔥🔥
Please build flying dutchman on water
You could make a temple insted of a church. (Im not good at spelling so if somethings spelled wrong thats why)
C'est incroyable 😳👌👌👌👌
Hey. Please do a Vikings village in the snow 👍
It’s amazing how you actually bother to do this for us, you and steph
You posting this is like an early Christmas gift
I’m curious as to what all Inspired you to do this creation
For this world when it comes out, will it still look fine if I put a realistic texture pack on?
I don't know if you'll see this but will you upgrade the nether and end as well?
religious things maybe a asterú sun circle
Arthur Morgan will be delighted...
So my Idea is for the Snowy Mountains. Now Picture in your mind...Mount Everest...Making a Mountain So Large that No Explorer has Ever been able to reach the top and back down and Lived...A small Village settled on the base of the mountain, warning Travelers to not attempt to Climb the Mountain, as they may lose their life. However a Legend is said that a Great Treasure lies in a cave at the very top of the mountain...But Guarded by a ferocious Yeti Beast. If Travelers dare take the challenge, They may either Die or be rewarded Greatly...Make your choice...
THANK YOU for another video
Doesn't matter which biome you tackle.. Just please promise me Trixy that you will add a decaying skeletal body of a giant serpent that is covering a village border that acts like It's wall. The lore behind it will be: " While some refugees from the plague survived they traveled many months to reach the (biome you choose) and worshipped a new god.  A serpent. They prayed to him and held rituals offerings and more to please the giant snake which would shield them from any harm. Which will continue until he ends up being poisended by a cleric who believes that the prophecy said that the time will come where the serpent will devour every inhabit of the village, So to save the villagers the cleric took this drastic step (while high on some epic herbal tea he made 5 stars on uber eats ) Now there is a giant skeletal maze or tons of minerals and ores protecting the village with some booby traps added later on.    For a religion can you do hinduism? their culture is so vibrant they have so many temple architectures and 10 Million+ gods! Love you vids keep up the hard work!!!
the... the skill... he is no mortal. that is a true minecraft creator in our wits
“There are two types of people in this world, those with loaded guns, and those who build, you build.”
It would be really cool if introduce Hinduism in this world.......love you work....keep it up...
so the map is only available with patreon?
"Water towers were used to supply water" TrixyBlox 2021
I think you should make a Grand city with a bunch of modern houses and buildings, I would really like to see that.
You started this as your 1Million specille. Now you are dubble.
Good video👍
Is it avaible for bedrock??
GG
My notifications aren't telling me when you upload I'm subscribed but it don't work
Wow
Finally
Woe
YOOO
Imagine if Dream did a Manhunt in this world 🔥
Did you use red dead redemption for inspiration?
Finally!!!
MY MAN HOW ???
Are you going to be remaking dungeons to? I think thats whats theyre called you mind them randomly when mining theres always a mob spawner of some sort and loot chests
I feel like there show be some inclusion of a “cow town”. A gambling paradise for cowboys having sold the cows, oh and a ranch or two.
15 minutes for waiting more than a month.. It's definitely worth it!
I am sad that i can't play the world.
Bro you forgot about the Hinduism, Buddhism etc. India religions I'd love to see them in future
Woooo
Ive  been waiting for the new episode for so long
Hell yeah I was waiting for that, very good done, your a legend, wish Mojang could get you to make official stuff to the game, your talent is necessary for this world
I literally checked the channel earlier to see if I missed a video. Talk about timing.
Ah yes, a 2 minute intro. How fun.
FINALLY!
only 11 minutes late to this video
amazing!!!!!!!!!!
Would love to see a Hindu Temple in your next biome!!😄👍 . . P.S- Your video was amazing as always 😁
YEEEEEAAAH, BOIIIIIIIII, finally trixy, been waiting for this since... Dunno, July?
This biome is definitely top 3
For the Snowey mountains I think a norse style village and a norse place of worship to Thor and Odin would be cool  Loving the series btw, this us amazing!!!
3:06 EA SPORTS ITS IN THE GAME
Finally its up! We are proud of you. 💖
Imagine this map open as a smp 🥵🥶
Hey Trix! Are you going to be upgrading the caves in the world as well now that 1.18 is out?
Pog
well done on 2 000 000 subs 🥳
You should do a small portion of the nether right outside the nether part of the giant broken nether portal in the plains.
You should be so proud of urself trixy! this looks fab
E
hey could the Tiaga  have a gothic catholic stile church
Wait too long for this finally it's here ❤️❤️
I would love to see a Buddhist monastery in the mountains
u
i go on you tube in the right time video vor 10 minutes
for the ice part i would love to see something utopian and advanced to contrast the map. like white and gold and beautiful like babylon
these videos are my fav
I feel like the snowy mountains could do like a Dwarven miner thing? Not quite sure, tho! And you can always do whatever you want with it, you don't have to take my advice! 😁
for the savanah i think you should do this tribe village and they worship a sungod! btw love your vids keep up the good work.
Finally a new video and why did you take so long to make a new video
Can u get this on bedrock edition? I want this on my Nintendo switch
Fun fact: the goat canyon trestle bridge is the longest curved wooden bridge in the US
I understand that you don't upload that much and I appreciate your work. Also this world is magnificent. Great job man
Yay ur back I missed ur survival island I love it
Its time for snow mountains! Also Merry Christmas and Happy New Hear❄️🎄❤️🎆
FINALY YAYYY
I LOOOOOOVE Your work. It is all amazing 💕💕💕
AHH! i've been waiting for so long, glad it's finally here! your builds are absolutely amazing.

Although it may be a bit of an odd choice, I’d love to see a Buddhist monastery or something similar (maybe for the mountains?)
OMG. YES WE BACK
So question... He says other realms to upgrade. Does that mean the End as well as I'm assuming the Nether? If the End is included in this rework, is the fortress getting a rework as well?

THIS LOOKS SICK! I wish I could build like this.
*"You've Yeed Your Last Haw"*
Maybe you can build some sort of a dwarf city in the mountains? Underground, with a forge and big stone statues.

This looks Phenomenal! You should try to incorporate maybe a frozen kingdom or sm in the mountains.   Also, I feel like having a custom mod pack for this world would be cool too. Can't wait to see future parts!

This may or may not be the greatest "Update" of all time. Change me Mind.
I love this minecraft could use a serious update 😍😍👏❤️
dang trixy this is so thought out and such a large scale
Bro what are the odds... literally just last night I was binge watching all the episodes to this series after just stumbling across the first part and was left on a 'cliffhanger' when I finished with part 4. Now part 5 released the next morning... wow. This is such an ambitious project! Keep up the grind man, mad respect to you.
the shape kinda looks like fortnite map lol
Would love to see a Hindu/Buddhist temple in the snowy mountains mimicking the Nepalese/Tibetan Monks!
''Congrats to everyone who is early and found this comment! 🏆''
I've been waiting so long for this video
What about 1.18 underneath caves? Will that be a biome or in 1.19 add massive deep dark custom village and stuff?
Wow you know alot about trains 👏👏👏
What about 1.18 underneath caves? Will that be a biome or in 1.19 add massive deep dark custom village and stuff?
ok
Finally YES!
So much potential in one biome 😌
Ah yes my favourite biome well done
Omg that's unbelivable Congrationlation
On the snowy biome build like a yetti cave and the land villagers are scared of this yetti and they all keep warning signs
We need like a little 'underwater village' like its been sunken for a long, long time. Not even an epic building, just a little village that has been submerged by water
Like i always say in all the other videos, THIS IS AMAZING
Ik early one's :D
keep going this is the best world ever can't wait for it to be done
