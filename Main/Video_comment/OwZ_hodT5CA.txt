BABY CLAP FOR THE ENCORE
Just the way that they went back and forth on the runs at the end is crazy! Loved this performance so much!
That was so beautiful
The way this performance just feeds my soul Every.Single.Time!! 🤍🤌🏾🤍
My friend fell in love with me and tried to use this to tell me. Thing was, he was got the streets not for me. We both knew it but he wanted my love cuz it was unfettered.
I hate they went strictly rnb this was so unique
We don't talk enough about this album getting so many of us through COVID. All their performances, especially during that time are AMAZING and ICONIC. Talk about adapting and thriving!!! Love them!
I come here often to see this masterpiece. I wish they would just keep performing this way!
why can't they combine as a sister's again with all that separating and being stuck somewhat famous sucks. they should be tucked underneath Beyonce wings as runner ups to mega famous instead of singers
This is highly underrated
“VMAssss”  immediately levitates
I fear this versions got more iconic lines to sing to 😭…
in other words, adele-rumor has it, sure shes got it all.....but baby is that really what you want? rumor has it is like death date by bby afrika and this song combined....keep it thourough and professional kings
2025 😮Spectacular Performance. ❤ these Sisters😊
❤❤❤❤
melhor que a versão de Studio, eu amooo
This makes me so sad I wish they would just go back to being a duo
out of sudden in my mind:  - VMAAAAsssssss
OMG, A Tour would absolutely chew! Call it The Baddie and the Princess Tour. EATS DOWN. An ode to Disney's The Beauty and the Beast, but giving everything ya'll in 2025.
Moments before Beyonce took their Afro futuristic style and bounce influence/operatic vocals.
Chloe sounds like she's singing even when she just says VMAs
This is so much better than the recording.
I miss them sm
e essas aqui vao voltar quando?
I JUST NEED NEW MUSIC FROM THEM AS SISTERSSSSS
This is crazy good <3 love you sisters
I feel like if the gospel singers Mary Mary had two daughters it would be them in the music industry with Beyonce as a fairy godmother amazing  right awesome fairy tale❤
amo!!
im still here
i’ll always come back to this vid
I don't know this song at all. Now I found it. And my God!! It's well done. Everything fits together. The song speaks to my soul!!
i remember seeing this performance for the first time. bts were actually up next and i was waiting for them but then chloe x halle did THIS and i was mesmerised and immediately added this song. incredible. wish they come back together
Yes ladies, keep it up. I like how u support each other. Good sisterhood. Beautiful energy.  Love the music
i hear beyonce
2025, girlies and guysies, roll call?!! ☎️ 💒🙌🏽✨
I love them
This is still one of the best performances ever on MTV, in my humble opinion. It's near perfection.
Saudades dela😢😢
back again
This is so Beyoncé
2025🎉
Chloe’s note at 1:44 gives me shiverssss
I love this version so much more than the recorded one!!
I had an unhealthy obsession to this song when it dropped and the video just made it chefs kisses for me.
They have the potential to be the next big thang.
precious
I love for this performance Beyoncé signed them to only stop them from reaching highest potential
This is on my of my favorite songs by them ughhh the vocals go crazyyyy 😩🥰🥰
need them back together
Still slaps 2025!!! They really ate this!!! We need a new joint album.
STILL HERE AT 2025!!
still need this version on spotify, the extra percussion HITS
I'm still playing this song now and forever
CAN'T believe this is FIVE (5) YEARS ago !!!!! Still ground breaking
we can only hope that they'll comeback for a reunion in the future <3
The Best Version ever
3:08 she was tripping out before us😂😂😂😂😂
Killer!
Wish they would have kept it this way very clean and simple all that was needed. Maybe one day
Nothing could replace them both🙏 Halle 🪽voice is everything so pure🥺🥹 love me love me love me love me~ love the🔫🔫at the end😊VMA🗣️🗣️ from the start.
.I need them back together. 😭💛
Julio 2025?
Probably one of the best performances I've ever seen ❤
i can’t believe they’re not making music together anymore 💔
Who is holding them back? They deserve to be bigger
well well well
Slay Queen MMD! Juz really in time for Happy Pride...
Official Video!
CHLOE KILLED THIS PERFORMANCE!!!! I have come to realize that CHLOE is the VOCAL GENIUS behind their music.
Bring me back to Gods country ☹️💔💔💔💔
Thank u
VMASSSSS
So much politics inside central banks. They control everything. Some solution is decentralization.
imagine missing the wisdom in saying "when you decide you likeyourself holla at me" all the things men do because they are self hating low self esteem having people trying to add value to themselves doing things their friends approve of, like rihanna saying "tryna fix your inner issues with a bad b****" More confident men are better partners and not as eager to prove anything to friends when they know they have a good woman and are happy at home. There are simply not as unstable as men with low self esteem, don't get me on internalized racism because boy that esteem isn't low its gone, empty...vacant.
Beautiful , etheral queens <3
June 2025
I don't know him😂😂😂
BABY. This was a fucking MOMENT. just gorgeous. Choreography, cinematography, costumes, makeup, hair, vocals, biggest kudos to anyone and everyone involved in this project!! 💜🙏🏽💙💜
They really carried my sanity through the pandemic. Ughhhhh this performance is tooooo gooood!!
HOW TF???? AMAZING
COME BACKKKKKKKKK AGHH
Please get back togetheerrrr
Halle understands less is more
THEY ATEEEE THAT
Yeah the end always takes the cake for me, really miss them together
I love that this pops up first when you search the song. You don’t even have to type VMAs. They know what’s up lmao.
Dominated Covid era ❤
This song STILL gives me goosebumps!!!
Still deserve a proper tour 😭🖤
amo essa performance
this song is out of this world
2025 and I still here
Eu quando tenho talento e rabao
my girls🌸🎀🩷
They were robbed a Grammy with this track unfortunately never forget.
please come back
Y'all sound amazing. Nice fits everything perfect.
This is just far better than the studio version
their harmonies and runs are as smooth as the money flowing into my bank account
this is a very underrated video🤩🤩🤩🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
It's 2025 and I'm still waiting for this VMA version to appear on Spotify. The added percussion adds so much to this song!
I miss them together. Their performances and the changes for every performance during covid was such a treat
Your voices and and beat are so fucking catchy! ❤
This song gives me fashion runway moment with that beat! 🥰
I loved this video sooo much !!!😊
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I need them to make another album together STAT
We need this version on Spotify please 🥹🥹🥹
Chloe should take pointers from Halle in the most Aspect possible.. Halle is Naturally Sexy .. at times it feel as though Chole tries to Hard ... The ones at the end were terrible because of our that ...
Please let them never break up ❤
2025❤🥹
What an angelic and powerful form of art! I absolutely love this. They need to work together, there aren't any cool duos out there!
this should've been their espresso
if not this year, please come back in 2026 chloe x halle
❤❤❤im back
They've convinced the world to be okay with a title of Ungodly hour after all the scandals of the entertainment industry.  😮
❤❤❤❤
2025
Going on 5 years, and this performance is still unmatched!
whenever i listen to this song i automatically sing this version, it’s superior ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Unironically, one of the best performances the VMAs have ever had. I always come back to it
RENASSAINCE
We got the preview for the Renaissance by Beyonce with this performance.
This performance is everything 🎉
Omg they are so good together, I’m ready for there next album together. The vocals are everything together 🔥
They need to be a duo again. The pandemic messed up their launch. Their careers will continue even further as a unique blend.
MEU DEUS QUE SAUDADES DA PRIMEIRA VEZ QUE VI ESSA PERFORMANCE
HxC made my 2020 groovy and loving in despite of the uncontrollable, depressing messes some of us found ourselves in.
still watching in 2025! love my girls!!!!
This is so angelic
I need them back together!!!!!
INCREDIBLE!🔥🔥🔥
I miss them together!!
👍👍👍
Beautiful voices they have, and I love their outfits! Stunning women 😃😍
Beautiful❤
THIS IS STILL THE BEST
I would love it if they reheated these nachos!
This was so good!
She should never go under Beyonce wing
iconic
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is mastering the art of Performance
Slayy
Anyone here in 2025????????
It sucks what beyonce did to them.
the split was too early in the mist of their success
2025!)
A duo that actually works! I get their need to pursue individual careers but in this case I felt like it was a bad move! They are such an incredible unit, a magical sound that would have a way better impact together than individually ❤
history was made this day
I'm so happy EVERY TIME I rewatch these queens 👑 this performance is so awesome, perfection
this is so c*nty!!!
Love to see and hear you all perform together!! We need a tour
Still so so good
THE VOCAAAALLLS

Lucius Expressway
Anyone in 2024?❤️
😘
Pasaron 4 años y las sigo amando
Sounds like the tik tok trend song, the anime with the muscly giant. Whats the name naked puppy I think
This is a beautiful performance
Who tf thought it was a good idea to separate them so soon....they just got in the mainstream/GP...and then boom they separated. They're insane together vocally 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯 hope they leave their label. Halle voice is angelic, chloe had a voice for opera ❤
I miss y'all music ❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

I made it. I practiced this song enough my bf asks me to sing it🥹
This was the highlight of a really bad year.
I wish this was in 4K
Shoutout to Disclosure for the amazing production!!! My fav track from the album.
*BEST WHEN TOGETHER!* 2:22-3:19❤ *MISS THEM!* 😢
miss them
the vocals !!
PUT THIS ON STREAMING ONCE AND FOR ALL
I still listen to this in 2024!! So good!!! ❤
why is no one commenting on the fact that these are sisters in sync. i'm am only child and i wished to have another by my side. can you having a sister or brother that's like this? this is a perfect performace, but it's amplified becuase they share dna. you can't make this up. this is real family, art, love coming together.
Can't stop watching obsessed❤
If Slim thick where a group it would be them ❤ they so fine
2024 ❤
I wish they could’ve released more albums as a duo.
This is how to slay a performance during a national pandemic. I enjoyed all of their performances from their home during covid.
I saw this in about when I was in the rehab center but it Mos Def helped thru the process
2024 anyone?
Song so brilliant n tht beat 🪘😍😍😍😍😍🪘 2024
I listen to this song religiously 😭
3yrs later💣💣💣💣 Still the best to do it  This will forever be for the books I love my sistas Chloe & Halle ❤❤❤❤ #UngodlyHour 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PUT THIS VERSION ON APPLE MUSIC, IT’S GODLY!!!!!
seriously this is better than the studio one😭
the texture of the music and the lighting matches like WHAT??!
2024 I am still confused about why these two women are not a "group" they pair so perfectly.
this the only way to listen to this song now
they created a masterpiece of an album and then dipped
Love compassion and forgiveness towards accountability
Feels like pre renaissance love the vocals !!
❤
Still so good
No one's talking bout how in sync they are while dancing🔥 And their voices are chef's 😘 Them harmonizing really well makes this performance even more amazing ❤❤❤
Love them both - but I’m a “Chloe” guy

This is ART
❤❤❤❤❤
🌏🌎🌍🌏🌎🌍🌏🌎🌍🥉🥈🥇🏅🏆🎖🥉🥈🥇🏅🏆🎖
Surely people know that this wasn't a live performance! All done in one take!! Please don't be that gullible DUMB one haha   Vocals are recorded in the studio.  Rehearse them. Rehearse dance. Perform as though singing it live.   All edited together.   Final product...  This video ...... And you thinking it is 100% live.   Like Halle can be spinning round with no effect on her vocals.   Like Chloe can be dancing that hard and it not have any effect on her vocals.    Don't be silly
Chloe needs to stop doing the aggressive look so much. It's only good now and then, otherwise she's always showing teeth lol
this just sounds waaaay better than the recorded vision on their album.
I’m obsessed with everything about this performance 😩🤩🔥
so much more powerful together I like they did they own thing but it’s time to get back together 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THIS SONG 🙏🏾🔥
Randomly started singing this . Im back 😂.. i love this song..
I wish I could have seen them perform at the Super Bowl yesterday 😩 they would had ate that and no crumbs. A whole vibe.
This só renaicense
Oh they knew the Renaissance was coming
This song and video eats The new era collabs gonna snap
Renaissance era
Tell me why every single time I listen to this song on shuffle or whatever, that I always start it off by going "VMAs......"
Always come back to this masterpiece.
One hit wonder 💀
They're so beautiful mygosh
coming back to say PLEASE RELEASE THIS VERSION ON STREAMING
My two white gold knifes become alive and performing on my table. 💀💀 Don't disrespect this two goddesses lol jk jk lol still 💀💀💀💀
They're so talented tho. Wtf?!
EXPENSIVE SONG
Giving Renaissance before Renaissance ! So talented ! People who appreciate talent and hardwork love you two 🫶🏼
THEY RELEASED THE BEST ALBUM OF 2020 AND WE DIDNT GIVE THEM ENOUGH CREDIT I SWEAR ON IT!!!!!
still iconic af, i miss them together
Oh I see pre renaissance 😂😂😂
cheiro de álcool em gel
This is undoubtedly one of the VMAs best performances. Halle's voice is like an angel. And Chloe's voice flows like silk. The cinematography here is insane; so simple yet incredible presence from the 2. So underrated.
This so is just glorious! ❤❤❤
THEIR MICS WERE ON!!!!!
I love how effortlessly Halle sings.  so beautiful.
they literally died oh wow </3
Vocais, figurino, cenário, música, coreografia, tudo muito podre de chique 😍
Every time I watch this I feel SO blessed!!! Truly beautiful!!! I get lost every time
This was already 3 years ago? Jeez.
I cannot get over this performance!
thats one the best performances of all! i love it
they dont do music like this anymore...
This is one of my all time favorite performances that I have ever seen and listened to.. Such a powerhouse.. It gives me goosebumps, all my senses tingle, my soul touched... The message, and I always have to dance when I listen to this.
they slayed

We need another album of this duo 😭💜
I love this performance so much 🥲🥹😭
A versão VMA, para mim, é a melhor até então ❤😍🫶 Amo!
I don't think I will ever get over these two.
💕
I miss them together so bad. I’ve been here way before Tik tok listening 😭 I’m not okay
this is the best thing to come out of the pandemic!!!
This is like the best thing I’ve ever heard and seen in my entire life.
Beyoncé finally decided to let people more talented than her take the stage. The smartest move she ever made. 👌😅
💜💜💜💜💜
the beat, the video, everyrhing ❤🔥
When the AI robotic f*ck boys take over, I hope I'm too old to care. Just imagine cheating robots, gaslighting AI, and hood mentality machine learning. 😳
Sooo goood
Their vocals and visuals are out of this world
I miss these two❤
They are the only newer artists that actually put effort into "the show"

Beautiful Queens👑👑💜💜
🩶🩶
You guys together are the bes t group ive ever seen in my life. I really love ur music
I can't decide wich one has the most beautiful voice 😂😂 Very good genes.😅
They are SO iconic
chloe x halle are really underrated. they deserve more recognition than what they have received... they are incredible and extremely talented. I've never heard harmonizing like that
ATE
I cant listen to this song without saying VMAs
The hidden harmonies are insane 😭
Them some bad bad girls right there!!!!!
Disclosure on the productions, one of my fav tracks from CxH
i am still watching this at least once a week. They ate the whole thing up
I’ll show my kids this amazing performance!
chloe is fire halle is ice
Halle is just on another level of amazing perfection
The outfit, the voices, the song, the setting is just amazing. I love the vocals and how good they can sing. A lot a people don't notice that their vocals are them. In the past, a lot of people use to call them "Mini Beyonces'" and people still call them that now. Let them be them and let them shine!
She deserved the role for Ariel. Her voice is just angelic
My favourite song 🥰😍🤩
This album, this performance, THESE TWO have changed my life and literally the world like oh my GODDDDD nobody is or could do it like themmmmmm. I love them so much, just can't get over how monumental this felt 3 years ago (?!!!) and even now! Im still blown away by them, jesus.
Ariel just said: “fck it, I already have legs might as well be perfection amount humans”

(Love me at the ungodly hour)
I love their dancing. Halle is so elegant and moves gracefully and Chloe is fierce and moves with assertiveness. Both show strength with their femininity in different ways
I think about this to this day
this performance changed the earths rotation
THEY STILL HAVEN'T TOPPED THIS SINCE!!!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Chloe's body movement is amazing
This VMA Video is 10x better than the official music video! Also love the audible additions to the song. This version just hits different.
CHILLS LITERALLY EVERY TIME!!! I NEED THEM BACK TOGETHER LIKE YESTERDAY, THIS ALBUM NEEDS A TOUR
I just realized this is live and not the MV. SLAAAAAAAAAPS
😩😩😩😩😩
These ladies are So Underrated love the CXH group
Here again cause they ATE!!
Próximo VMA chegando e não podemos esquecer da noite em que essas duas fizeram história com um pré-show
I don't know, but they're both incredibly talented, it's something impressive how each one stands out in something specific, for example, Halle has a harmonious voice and Chloe has dancing talent.
Hino atemporal ❤❤❤
I'm 9 years old i love you guys and Halle the little mermaid 😢🎉😢❤   I love you so much 💗
JOHN 6:47 VERILY, VERILY, I SAY UNTO YOU, HE THAT BELIEVETH ON ME HATH EVERLASTING LIFE.
I love them individually but together they are insane 🤯
Just noticed they had the chrome look for this album and now it’s the theme of the renaissance album/tour.
They deserved an award ps I bet mama B was so proud
That was magical
Omg beh 😍 Angel angeeeel
I think “RENAISSANCE” by Beyoncé was inspire by this performance
😁🙋‍♂️
Halle est gracieuse et douce
When she says love me love me love me it’s just so soft and in tune to my soul
MUY PRO
I love y’all so much ❤ the icons of our generation
Something hauntingly beautiful about their voices.
im gonna name my children after this video
halle's gaze oh my god
this was a cannon event for me when this came out holy shit I still will never shut up about this performance
THEY DID THAT!!!!!👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🥰😇
I’m sorry this was IMMACULATELY clean and GORGEOUS
This was such amazing performance. I think the ladies should give it another shot
Halle is a girl very talest
nunca voy a olvidar el día que vi esta presentación en vivo y quede totalmente enamorada de ellas <3 ya son casi 3 años y las sigo amando demasiado desde que las vi por primera vez
It took Beyoncé 7 years to get on mtv
Chloe is very pretty ♡
The amount of times I come back to this.  It’s like addiction 🧐
Does anybody get a 90s/00s nostalgic feel listening to Chloe and Halle? 😍
Love their vocals and they are both beautiful
Was it Chloe or Halle that did that high "play those silly games" run at 1:58
Im just back here again to enjoy a great preformance
Til this day..NO one sounds like them.
🔥🔥🔥
Ariel sounds sooo heavenly🥰
2 years later and I still love this performance
❤️❤️❤️
I absolutely adore these two together. They should stay together and don't do separate albums....infinitely better together. It's a mess apart. They balance eachother. It's like yin & yang ☯️ beautiful art together. Thee best 👌🏽
i’m obsessed with this song , can’t get it out my head
The two coins in my pocket when I'm running to the bus
cuando ella dice LOVE ME LOVE LOVE ME nena q voz tan preciosa
I find myself coming back here when my soul wants real music, real artists.
chloe sounds sooo good here. she can do anything!!!
THEY EATTTTTT
Nah because these girls can SING!
Halle sings and moves so effortlessly. She’s so sultry and you can tell she’s not even trying 🥰🥰
i would gladly crash my boat looking for these sirens
Then ICONS
1:46 is so heavenly 😭
And thats how renaiscense was inspired
One of favourite 2023 songs 🥰
There are mesmerizing individually and collectively unstoppable #grits
It's a travesty that they were put in the pre-show, but low-key I love this more than I love even the actual music video! This could have been the official video for the single, and it would have become just as iconic as Single Ladies IMO.
I will never ever get this performance outta my mind!!! Been watching it nonstop since 2020 😭
The foil left in your oven at midnight:
REAL SINGERS!!!!!! REAL TALENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stupende❤🙌❤
Y’all this song sound so magnificent
Wow
let’s never forget how these two queens gave us consistent visuals &  multiple live performances all throughout covid 👑 👑… was even performing from their own backyard 💪🏾💪🏾 … Thank you 🙌🏾🙌🏾  Queens your hard work & talent  was appreciated!!
😍😍😍😍😍
they ate that performance
The chicken embotido in the oven
Why this version dont go to Spotify? 😢
This era was amazing the performance i miss lockdowns sometimes
😍😍😍😍😍😍❤
By far the best live vocals live seen since Grande 💯 I don't care how many of the beehive come for me, performance wise they're exactly what the industry needs. Beyonce's had to work for years to pull off live vocals as well as these Queens do naturally. For me, they're the best I've seen in many years and their individual styles just as iconic. Wish them there most greatness and happiness in abundance
Halle is magical.
It’s the fact I will turn the able version off and play this one because they hit so much harder live!!!! ❤❤❤
I just watched The Little Mermaid last night and just love Halle even more for her performances.
I miss them as a group Don't get me wrong they deserve all the flowers for their individual accomplishments but chole first solo album being a commercial flop rubs me the wrong way
cheirinho de pandemia aqui. Elas foram LUZ

Beautiful song and performance
This should’ve been the music video.
Where is the excitement for the “talking all niiigghht”
✨
Chloe's voice has such a fullness to it, whereas Halle's voice has such a classic element to it. And what is insane to me is both sisters are monsters musically individually. But together, they make magic.
Im back for the second year in a row to obsess
Hi hallexChloe bailey how much money do you have???

Thay are actually good
Ariel❤
They are so incredible 🫶🏾
please REMEMBER THIS WAS DURING COVID AND THEY DID ALL THEIR VIDEOS ON A CLOSED SET...AKA THEIR BACKYARD.
Amo
That “mooore” from Halle was so enchanting 1:54
Halle’s breath control is outstanding
CHILLS. That’s what I got while watching, wow this performance was amazing. The song feels nostalgic for some odd reason and I love it, their harmonies are just jaw dropping. Love it. I would like to hear more music like this.
🧜‍♀️ ❤️
i love them soooo bad
I'm just waiting for the next time both of them sing together, this was pure art ♥
✨👑✨
Something about this song is just so addicting..... I love Chloe and Halle!!!!!!!!!
Best woman era hall
The fact that a live performance makes me listen to them is just amazing ❤
They were so siblings in this
Essa música e apresentação são tão boas!🤍🤍
A simple and quick answer on 'why was she chosen as the little mermaid' 😉
2:18
That’s talent! ❤
they really are together like fire and ice. they have DISTINCT performing style and vocals YET as a group they sound  as one. the IMMENSE talent of these two women are just phenomenal. blessing us with vocals and visuals.
3 years later and this vmas is so nostalgic to me 😢
Halle is the standout. I'm starting to feel bad for Chloe.
Ugh I hope they make more music together in the future ❤
Halle is so graceful and captivating.
I’d love to spend some ungodly hours with these two. Dear lord have mercy
Filhas de Sasha Fierce!
This song and performance and amazing, but Halle Bailey at 1:57 is one of the best!!
My favorite version of this song
I like them better together. I think they balance other out.
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me  ERIC:Oh yes, Ariel, im coming

Ariel when she got her legs
2:15 😩🤍
AMO ESTA CANCIÖNNNNNNNNNNNNN <3
i don't want to just download the song. I want THIS VERSION. AMAZING
iconic
I’m still mad they didn’t win the Grammy for best album. They worked hard during the pandemic. IN THEIR BACKYARD
Listen with caution may cause compulsive repeating    😵‍💫 😵‍💫 😵‍💫
Love these girls 🥹 their voice sounds like angels singing at the heaven gates still in may 2023
🔥🔥🔥
Wonderful 😍😍😍👏👏👏

Out of this World Performance ✨ No need for audience 😘❤️❤️
This was my renaissance
My favorite performance yet
You know you did well when the live performence is more popular than the music video 🎉
Shepherd's Chapel Network !!!!!!! Pastor Murray is an Anointed Servant of GOD who teaches the Word of GOD with Authority!!!!!!!
Halle offers such a soft ,sensual,presence and Chloe offers such a Fierce,outgoing,vivacious presence! BOTH BALANCE EACH OTHER INCREDIBLY WELL! They are both ✨SUPERSTARS✨!!
Dang Chloe voice has grown so much from here to “in pieces” I didn’t even notice how strong it’s gotten
Great song and performance!!! Most truly a classic❤❤❤❤
Uczę się, gracie na układzie
CRACK
NewJeans 🐰
Halle is very smooth and Chloe pushes too much In vocals and dancing . Both very talented but Halle is very natural
Yo what genre is this?❤
02:23 - 02:42 just talent.
Love how they are so different and harmonise well
NewJeans brought me here 🐰
I have this on repeat! ❤
How many people reenacted this performance with a sibling or bestie? 🤣
This is aging well cause Got damn  it's beautiful!
I come back to this video often. This version of this song is an instant classic.
The two mosquitoes flying around my head : dis dope 🦟 🦟
*Goosebumps* love it . Their voices.omg
This performance is just godly
SWV vibes....(late 80s for u youngins).
These girls have blown my mind and seduced the music industry very talented beautiful personalities presentation unique qualities i have never seen in any artist other than beyonce i cannot get enough of them their voices were a gift from god !!
They were ahead of their time.✨
chloe is always so extra she wants all the cameras attention 💀
LOVEEEEEE THIS FN song still
Youorthebestiamsoabigfan😁😄😀😃🤣
My thoughts on The Ungodly Hour, seeking to understand why this Title, what the song means. Just listening to Halle and Chloe's songs for the first time tonight. Love to hear their voices in my ears. Beautiful singing styles. I question why not more godly songs, though they are keeping with trends and times, would love to hear them sing some Gospel classics. Still processing the meaning of this song. They are very talented..The message in this song, is it that the person who is up to no good should call them when they awake from doing the wrong thing like cheating, and choose the one who waits for them to change their self and come back to where they are loved? The ungodly hour is the time when the devil and his demons are attacking through dreams, with temptations, lust, the flesh, and lies. Love covers the multitude of sin. the Word of God, the spirit of truth is in love. So choose love, obedience to love, to love one another.
Piękny projekt ,kto was stworzył?😁❤👌🙋‍♂️
Listen, they showed up as if God sent them Himself!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Zbierajcie się piękności, czas na nas ,pilnujcie się  ,niewybaczlm bym sobie gdyby coś wam się stało
Love it from netherlands
❤❤
Beautiful song, beautiful girl
We need the duo back! Too many solo artist! Their voices together are so much more dynamic and powerful. They are so beautiful! Bring back girl groups!! Idc these two together were on their way to dominating the game! I hate that they separated. Hopefully only for a short while. I love their individual projects as well but as a duo just 🔥
Pilnujcie brzuszków coś jeszcze z was będzie

Talented ladies. My ears are blessed.
2023💙
They're both bad to the bone. Very talented ladies. #My Girls
My god, the talent of these two is out of this world!!
진짜진짜진짜 너무 좋아............
2:31 being the most replayed part, so glad it was my fav part to listen to
O
O que eu
First time hearing this .. Halle is so humble
Anyone else notice their outfits are a reference to the 1927 silent film *Metropolis*? Could you tell me why that is?
This is everything and more
Disclosure KILLED this beat
passou dois anos dessa apresentação, e sempre volto aqui.
The ending was giving rock with me MJ w that light show lol
These girls are amazing
This performance outclassed the video❤️💯
I forget this isn’t the “official music video” They’re beyond amazing.
Will this ever go over to Apple Music I wanna download it so bad lol it’s amazing 🔥🔥🔥
I'm a grown 45 year old man and I listen to this song constantly. And no I'm not gay 😂. This is so good
The best album we need more
And this performance still lives in my brain rent free.
Were they SINGING live?
their voices are so so so beautiful like absolutely unreal.  for me this is one of the best performances ever of the vmas
2 years later and I still think about this glorious performance!!
I’m back ❤❤❤
There's mesmerizing. Especially the one on the right. So beautiful.
sister goalss
2023
I love Chloe and Halle so much they give me v much Mary Mary soul energy pop girls lol
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
2:20
The best performance
Wooooow!!!
I just can't get enough
Damn
i'm that hour
VMA's..... welcome to the ungodly hour.
Absolutely mesmerising!💖🙏
I don’t like the anti God undertone in most of Chloe’s work.  She bowed down to that Illuminati fast and hard.  Halle is a little more reserved and natural, it’s beautiful
AS MAIORES 😍😍
🔥🔥🔥
Wooowwwwwwww  I thought I was watching a video .. this a performance .. they so prefect ❤
So talented. Love love love love love  ❤️
personally think chloe is stronger vocally
They were better together.
They could've went all night, Chloe probally cried after the live 😅❤😂
Jesus, just, Jesus
heart eyes
Amazing
Beyoncé Jr that Chloe
They're so beautiful
They look like godesses here. Omg
whoever designed their outfits tho
Halle is very sexy she reminds me of Aaliyah and Chloe is more beyonce and I like Chloe but i always loved Aaliyah. Chloe just too much with her ass out and coochie poppin she's beautiful and has a unique powerful singing voice. Ppl think the key is toxic songs but if someone dropped something abt love they would go far but as for chloe she couldve left it at the silhouette challenge for me 😆
This song make me jump I love this song a real feel good
*quick request, please upload the lives you blessed us with from Jimmy Fallon show, specifically, Everywhere and Down. Thank you! Thumbs up everyone who supports this request*
listen to Halle at 3:01 😫😫😫😫😫😫😫😍
We need new ChloexHalle music. We really deserve it 🤧🥺
Omg 😳 I love this song and their performance 🎭 ❤
One of the most beautiful voices,that I ever heard.
Amazing
they ate so hard in this performance
Perfect
PEOPLE DIED
My favorite song of theirs
Black Girl Magic
only just realised they are saying 'VMAs' at the beginning and not be amazed
No crumbs were left
I could watch this a million times
Too good
Y’all should’ve never separated them.. 😢
👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goosebumps everytime 🔥🔥
Your nose your eyes belong on the floor so that they belong whenever they are around
Idk why but I love this song
I watch this video still and the synch of their voices how they balance each other out it gives me chills how their voice is so unique from the point when I remember the videos they did. them being in a couple of Disney channel stuff so proud of them
I like how all the their songs have a futuristic sound to them making it sound even better or maybe it's the voices singing
Young Beyonce, sounds great.
Are hey officially splitting doing their own thing? I love them as a duo :(
There is no reason for them to be that Incredibly generous
This performance will always be iconic 😍😍😍
This is the little mermaid we all needed!  Big fan.
coming back after 2 years to say that this is still a masterpiece
I’m seeing two sides of feminine power. Chloe dark feminine - Halle alluring femininity
Ridiculous talent. What is in those genes ???
That hour might be ungodly, but their voice is surely truly godly😍
Power in two beings.
i have been watching this for 2 years straight 😵‍💫 i remember this being the only performance i really paid attention to on tv that night. i still want this to be on spotify sooo bad 😕💕
They are just as gorgeous as they are talented
There wasn’t very many high points during peak pandemic but I tell you I was watching and listening to this daily and loving it.
How did they not win best new artist at the grammy's?? I will never forgive the recoding academy!
still one of my favorite things ever~
Ok this song smacks and on 🔥🔥💥☄️ I love it ❤
개이뻐 ㅁㅊ
Halle has angel's voice..
I’m obsessed with this performance,Omg!

(Love me at the ungodly hour)
This was really good. 💯. Big fan here.
This can’t be live
This blew my mind, amazing 😻
This is so good <3 Very talented
I’m surprised that this song doesn’t have more views. I think it’s better than a lot of new pop and r&b coming out these days. IDK, I’m 33 and this song has a late 90s, early 2000s vibe to it, maybe that’s why I like it so much.
This is another level of perfection
In this outfits, Halle looks celestial, Chloé looks desperate.
Damn!! Their voices are insane!!!!!
i lovee this song💖😍😍😍😍💖💖💓Chloe x Halle💓💓💞💞💞💖💖💖💖
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

The fact VMA did them dirty, cuz they don't know what the hell they doing, including Gammy's, Oscar's, I dnt know what y'all  kids waiting for, cancell all of the music gatekeepers  NOW
grave ung pitik ng katawan makabali buto AHAHAHAHAH
Whoever did the light thing is a genius
That girl's eyes are so far from eachother 😭
i know nobody asked but idc i remember when i first started watching grown-ish and  i saw chloe and halle i instantly fell in love with them me being a 14 year old girl and all ngl my mom doesn't provide me with the type of confidence that they do my mom always has something bad to say and especially abt me but they tell all of us to follow our dreams and be us everything that they provide for me is what my momma will never think or even try to provide for me and she never even has i just wish i could thank them for everything they did and are doing for me
This is better than the album version
What a pair of women clearly born to create such magic with their voices. This is truly beyond world class. Then the outfits, arrangements, choreo, camerawork… awesome work to everyone involved!!!!
Idk why this feels like years ago to me
Baybeh...!!!
Yo this shit is straight sick they killed this shit the fuk they doing in the preshow them.vocals.is fire mannnn half these rnb chicks can't do this and they dumb young too this is that shit go head gurls
Forever love this version than the original 😩😩❤️❤️
🤩👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 I LOVE EVERY BIT OF THIS! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I can't get over how amazing these girls get every time I hear them!!!
Maravilhosas, talentos prodígios, desde pequeninhas, Deus as abençoou.. futuro do pop EUA. 😍🔥🤯😱👏
Why they call it ungodly hour
And they ALWAYS sing Live and sound Perfect I just Luv them. 🤌🏿
chloe and halle are both great
I used to think she was saying “be amazed welcome to the ungodly hour “ now I know she saying VMA’s
Crazy how it all started with  THERE WAS A TIME WHERE I THOUGHT I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.  (BEYONCE SONG) Now they showing other celebrities how to do it right. They come a long way
I did a Cover to your Beautiful song! Ungodly Hour! https://youtu.be/MKXMp_vDIJ4
A year and this is still gold
FIRE
Almost two years and it's still hits🔥💕
Them together I love their harmony
love you Hailey. you are so sweet girl.
I love this so much!
Iconic 🙌🏾
Boi they could blow
Mesmerizing 👽👽👽👽
forever iconic
Amazing
They have the best  lives performances
I miss them making songs together
This is on repeat for me 🥴😍
EUGH !!! 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
they deserved AOTY but yall did them DIRTY.
Wow, this randomly popped up!!   They melt together sooo well!  This was golden!
This song is way too unique i love each and every chorus
I can't listen to this song without saying "VMAS welcome to the ungodly hour"
I mean, Beyonce choose wisely for real. These two are like the perfect version of DC's harmony back in time. These girls glow up different. They servin us extra as always! <3
Two year Anniversary of Ungodly Hour Album today!!! 🥹
When I see Halle in this..I see Whitney in the movie bodyguard.
I love their vocals here. The harmonies were perfect
i never thought i could be this wayyy obsess after ariana, the whole album was fire 🔥
VMA version > Original
This performance carried 2020
This is so good, so fresh! They're pure talent.
This the best version
On sent bien l'inspiration de Beyoncé sur Blow
This performance is so perfect
when their riffs in 3:09 blended in SO well.. i fr ascended to heaven
Amazingly ridiculously awesome... WOW !
This would be considered afrofuturism. I'm getting some Janet Jackson, Beyoncé and TLC influences. Can someone recommend more music with this vibe?
The little ones a star
i thought that this was an mv is just so perfect
Talent for days 🙌 👏 👌
I miss when they made music with each other 🥲 in my opinion Chloe’s true talent showed when she made music with her sis. Now she’s making mediocre music about her booty lmao
Hit me with your eyes I never seen that kind of view You walkin' over here The way that it went down, that's when I knew We be talkin' all night But I can tell you need to work on you, you, you Like you, you, you, like you Like you, mmm  You be playin' sweet But, baby, don't you know that talk is cheap Can't fool me I wish that you could back it up for me, me, me Like me, me, me, like me  You know that I, I heard it all before You're hesitant, but you could give me more I know you like to play those silly games When you're done, call my name  When you decide you like yourself (Holler at me) When you decide you need someone (Call up on me) When you don't have to think about it Love me at the ungodly hour When you decide you like yourself (Holler at me) When you decide you need someone (Call up on me) When you don't have to think about it Love me at the ungodly hour  I don't have the time To teach you how to love all over again And let me ask you this Are you givin' all that you could give?

(Love me at the ungodly hour)
They compliment each other so well
Sirens of the present day!! They mesmerize me completely
In my youth I sat out to be a passionate and other worldly type man and lover; using esoteric music and conversation to stimulate the mind and enhance the relationship with my partner.  These ladies give this by blending symphonic and opera vocalization into modern music that sounds somewhat strange, but beautiful!  I pray, the industry doesn't destroy them as a team: they are a whole package, but the suit and tie always separates singing duos and families; then they fade away.   Peace
Maravilhosas 😍
I will never stop to religiously watch this on a daily basis
Chloe’s for the streets 🤫
1:08 HALLE??? WHEW
this whole performance is amazing but from 2:23 onwards it's like being in heaven i swear
Halle truly is the perfect disney princess so beautiful!!
❤
wow beatiful voices and they are gorgeous too
their outfits are very Sasha Fierce.. reminds me of B's Get Me Bodied performance at BET too
anyone else just come back to this all the time. it's untouchable in my books
This is heaven!!!
Come back to watch this performance every few months!!! They gave vocals, effortless stage presence and LOOKS. My lordt!!!
I just watched this video for the how-many-th time, and Chloe x Halle ATE. THIS. SH!T. UUP! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
The last few notes were immaculate
B1TCH THIS WAS ALIVE PERFORMANCE?????????
Uhm thundertighs wow those legs
I'm quite sad that we don't get to see Halle perform anymore. She's so talented!!
Am I the only missing them making music together?
This song is so sweet and such a vibe on the album
Chloe😍😍😍😍😍
:-)
2:44 my favorite part ❤️
Wow
i was so gagged when I first saw this and just when I thought I was beginning to recover they gagged me again
why am i just now experiencing this💚😭
One day this song will get the justice its deserved.
It’s utter MAGIC when these 2 song together.
I love Halle's unique tone. It's beautiful!
Halle's voice on this version hits harder
Monica & Brandy of 2022!
OOFTA I'm still listening on repeat in 2022 bb this is so 🔥😍
I’m still not over this.
I love them together
I’ll never get over this 😢
MY GIRLS
definitely work out to the choreography ! do THEIR CHOREP 3 TIMES BACK TO BACK  FULL OUT LIKE YOU DOING THE SHOW YOURSELF. IT WILL GET YOU RIGHT!! I LOOOOVE IT
The album version does this song no justice compared to this shit! I love love this version. Angelic voices both of them!!!!!! I need the audio on my phone rn!!!!
The vocals from 2:23 and on were ridiculous!! Talented for sure!
I am amazed.
Im just saddened to see how as a society we didn't give them enough recognition.
Incredible and effortless by both of these sisters they compliment each other so well one with the snap one with the roll.. wonderfully done even better than the official video in my opinion just plain dope ✌🏾🌹🌹🌹🖤🖤🖤🧬🧬🧬
🔥FYAH🔥
Damn they killed this vocally
THEIR LIVE VERSION IS SO MUCH BETTER THEN THE ORIGINAL AUDIO!!🥰🥰
Glory to God!!!!
beauty as a work of art
The foil holding my chicken while I’m at work
The fact that their live performance video has more views than the actual video is pretty insane. They did that!! 🔥🔥🔥
Iconic
0:43
chloe is kinda too loud in the harmonizing parts no wonder she went solo lmao
Definitely prefer this version over the other. Think it does the vocals justice, especially Halle's.
They are the BOMB!!!!!!! Like other worldly
3:02 😭💗
this has more views than the music video  that should have been enough to put this version on spotify
I WANT THIS VERSION ON SPOTIFY  😭😭
i’m not joking when i say this performance changed my life
Showstoppers
This one is better version than the original version
Those drums they added are so perfect
I don’t know which live version I *need* the most. Pleaseeee put all the live versions in an album.

Every time Chloe says 'VMAs' I hear 'Be amazed' instead and think to myself 'Yes, indeed.'
Getting chills
I recently found this song and started liking them more but I can’t tell which one is Chloe and which one is Halle
DEVOURED LIKE ALWAYS
Love this! complimentary duo!
Here because I love this version better than the original 😭🤍
🍽️🍽️🍽️🍽️🍽️🍽️🍽️🍽️
I keep coming back on this epic performance!!!
Plz put this on Spotify !!!
I prefer this version, the studio versions vocals were overly mixed, I prefer this vocal and added harmonies and runs. I would love if they re record this but add even more complex harmonies and runs
Sdds

My favorite performance of theirs.
Gorgeous 💖
3:17 When I accidentally stepped on my cat's tail.
Can't believe this year it will mark 2 years since this performance, I remember watching it on TV and being absolutely OBSESSED. Love you girls so much!
They are  the new destiny's child
2022! Brazil here 😍😍😍
2022 still watching this everyday for breakfast
They should release the version 🔥🔥🔥🔥
No wonder why they chose her to be Ariel
help i listen to this more than the studio version😭 how do they sound even better live
I’m still waiting for a hologram device that plays this performance on a loop. Guess I gotta make it
Is this really live? omg -- even if it's not... this is so godly
😍😍😍😍😍
2:58 😍😍😍😍😍😍
This can end the pandemic. No cap.
And im back a year later…hell i always come back. The vocals the arrangement the look EVERYTHING about this brings me back every time. Can’t wait until the world realizes how talented these queens are.
Now I'm a huge fan now‼️‼️‼️😻😻😻💕💕💕💕
Theee best live performance I've ever seen!!!!😍😍
I would literally watch this every second of every day if I didn't have stupid human obligations. I can't ever get enough. My GAWD <3
Their voices just fit like a puzzle WTF!!! BLACK MAGIC 🪄✨💅 1:09 AM  JANUARY 12, 2022
Geesh, they are beyond talented. Rare and Special. Shine On Queens.
I feel like they are some powerful demon sisters from the underworld that they would do this to seduce Dante, son of sparda, to destroy him.
ok but i still cant understand how they didnt win
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Queens 💖💖
Perfeitas né mores
This performance is mesmerizing.
I think about this performance alot it’s incredible
for the past year, i've come back and forth from this video and other performances from MJ, Beyonce, Tina Turner, MC, Prince, Freddy Mercury, etc.   maybe everyone else is afraid to say it but chloe x halle's performances stand toe-to-toe with those greats - in terms of technical capabilities, vocals, playing instruments, visuals, emotion, and everything else that factors into a good performance. they don't have the commercial success to be considered "legendary", but in my eyes they're already legends.
I don't understand why this album didn't sell well, I feel they are on fire
I love watching them ❤️
chloe thighs . whatever
Chloe's intensity and Halle's chill has got me all conflicted... and their vibe as a duo is mesmerizing.
Miss wanna Daniel Naomi NimASoleil Margaret love 💕 and uncle uncle please let me know what you want me and I miss wanna and love baby love 💕 love you 😘 baby miss you 😢 mommy baby mommy daddy mommy baby mommy mommy daddy baby love you 😍 miss mommy baby miss miss mommy mommy daddy
This is talent. This… this is talent. If they don’t pop off then we failed
Beyonce-Sweet Dreams💯
"VMAs, welcome to the Ungodly Hour"  yes girllllllll ❤❤❤
ChloeHalle
the definitive cultural reset
I’m here for the 134th time and I’m still amazed.   Ps. I actually counted  Now 156
They  are  both  one  of  a kind  and  together  they're  unstoppable!
They’re just so perfect together
I love the ending so much like when Halle is singing 'Love Me'  then Chloe comes in and be a literal siren!!! its just such an amazing song
Missing this version of CXH, especially C.  Not sure what happened.
Yall I'm currently obsessed with this song

This radiates pure virgo energy
Hands down my favorite performance of them
oh man how i love their voices. literally makes me tear up. so otherworldly and just enchanting
Halle voice is awesome,  sad to see them separate,  but considering the way chloe going. Disney wont allow that..
Beautiful ❤
OBSESSEEED
i still can't believe they didn't sing in the main show..... like-
Sublimissime à voir et à écouter 🤩
🔥
This track is a bop!
Both amazing. When Halle sings ‘love me love me’ aaaa wow
This performance is everything. Out of this world.
I like halle because she's reelly trying to have her own personnality let's encourage her 👏👏👏
They were born for this
I'm back back back back again!
So I JUST found out about this song & I AM IN LOVE!!!!
@beyonce lol as we proceed to give you what you need
they not in such pell as predicted lol
So hard to believe this is live.
Silent sleigh in WeHo LA   December 4th and 5th Best Weekend Party,  First time ever in history!   Holidays food is greenish ice and  beautiful soup  Margritas with red sugar sprinkles on the rim! Wear black green and red vintage clothes. It's about deaf and hard of hearing people who are part of the Christmas spirit you want to join and share the love?!! Learn Christmas songs in sign language I dare you! Silent Sleigh WEHO
They are so artsy, cool, and unique as a duo. Now Chloe went solo and is just trashy and performs like any other artist that just shakes ass. Sad.
As good as the music video was, this is way better.
Beatiful. Talented and great voices.💖💖
THIS IS SO FUCKING AMAZING
Chloe MF ATE in this!! Especially towards the end she was going AWF
Oh this still go CRAZY!!!
👍👍👍
This lives rent free in my head forever !!!!
yo this is art
>>>>>>> Have Mercy
This whole song 🔥🔥 especially  1:41-1:45
Please don’t take this video down ❤️
Shame what the industry is turning these talented young women into....
I will never forget what this did to me
This performance outdoes the entire VMA’s
Oh I thought this was a music video😂
This sounds too good to be live and I mean this as a compliment☕
THEY JUST ATEE
Ungodly hour? Not obvious at all.
Ungodly hour 😏😒 uuugh yeah okay.
DO I HEAR A HINT OF A SAMBA BEAT ON THIS? 2:27. PRODUCERS, COULD YOU CONFIRM? IF SO: LIT.
Every performance is always on point!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
2o21 November 12 a beautiful 😍 ✨ ❤ ♥ 💕 💖 😍 song 😍
At least they not rolling all over the floor this time
My life theme why they released this song
Halle has the voice of a siren ❤️
after 1:26
The studio version did this song no justice. On the othe hand Halle is a unseen weapon. Let me tell you, people are focused in body, when Halle ready to step up and shine...babeee. She understands the assignment.

till this day i always say DNA instead of VMAs... wanted to reply under that specific comment but cant find it
i love the percussion addition once chloe started up
This isssss sooooo fireeeeeee
I love humans💕
I keep coming and watch this and the tiny desk videos monthly
This is the performance that introduced me to them and I’m never looking back
2:23
i hope we can get a choloexhalle and little mix collaboration.
as much as chloe hits it fiercely, halle performs with such ease it comes off alluring. love them both tho!!
LOVE LOVE LOVE
Love this one more than the original…miss seeing them perform together 😭❤️…
Halle is so effortlessly graceful.
Crazy how the performance has more views than thee actual music video😳
If Yin&Yang were people, because…✨🤌🏽🖤 *SN: I’ve watched this an unhealthy amount of times🤷🏽‍♀️😂🥴😍
🤍🤍
my silverware performing in the microwave i accidentally put them in 2:39
I’m fucking obsessed
LORD EVERYTHING IS SO BEAUTIFUL
I love that music that starts w "VMAs..."
This is my shit one of my favorite songs .... and that says something with this  being the new generation 💙♥️💙😃👑
THIS IS TALENT!!! They are so amazing, this performance, THE VOCALS, and dancing is EVERYTHING!!! I love watching black queens shine LITERALLY
Favorite performance of all time so far 🔥🔥 from these  Queens❤️
This performance teach me how a "live pre recorder version" can be miles away better than the album version.
This performance doesn't get the credit it deserves.
Wow 😳 the way they control their voices!
Dude, chills.
Chloe @ 2:43 was giving Beyoncé early 05 Check Up On it vocals… and I’m in love 😍
This was a cultural reset. And I’m just now processing this was over a year ago
HALLE ITS GOING TO SNATCH OUR EDGES ON THAT LITTLE MERMAID SOUNDTRACK ,GURL I CANTTT WAITTTT
Why would anyone ever wanna separate these 2?!?! This was AMAZING!
I don’t care what anyone says; the first lyric to this song is “VMAs!”
I only got YouTube premium for performances like this 😘😘
❤️ this is lit
Anyone still coming to look at this spectacular everything of a performance a year later!?!
This hits so much better
The black Cookouts were waiting on this one
a force love these ladies
best song on the album imo <3
So talented and captivating 💯👏🏾💃🏽🎉🥰
This was an amazing performance.
And this is still ICONIC. 🌞
This is an everyday watch for me. yes
Good lord Halle is freaking addicting to watch
I absolutely love this version, I've been listening to it ever since they preformed and the fact that the live version is so much better is amazing.   I CANT GET OVER HALLE'S "love me" PART ITS SO GODLY
Yes.
Everything about them is so healing.
This is my all time favourite performance by them. Their energies blend perfectly here and the vocal arrangement, outfits, lighting 👌🏾

💜
love this song!
This is the only thing saving me from insanity
OMG they are fierce 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ungodly hour 👏🏾👏🏾❣️
0:45

I covered this song if anyone wants to check it out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqgNhkM8HBA
Mawmah this is art.
THIS PERFORMANCE WILL REMAIN ICONIC FOREVER PERIODT!😭🥺✨❤️
Chloe 😭😭😭♥️
being a duo, Chloe is too overpowering and always wanting centre stage, kinda sad
Why isn't that on spotify
When Beyonce money, management, experience and talent is finessing your talent ... this is what you get: The NEXT BIG IT of MUSIC.
beautiful perfect ❤️💜 🇧🇷
think about this performance all the time
See , chloes always been feirce
I play this version ONLY! ITS THE BEST!!!
I'm starting to think Halle keeps Chloe from being....out there when they're together. Can't really see Halle being a part of 'have mercy'
Oh Halle.. wow
😍😍😍😍😍
Amo demasiado sus voces
beautiful.
Chloe used to be sexy without trying. She's very...explicit...these days 👀.
These mics were ON.
😀😃😄😁😆😅🤣😂 I love you
O refrão lembra Nice Guy 😍😍😍
this is better than Chloe's last performance 😐
I keep on replaying this performance.....they're just too good
I should of been born twenty years ago
For me, no one will ever be able to convince me that this performance wasn't the best in years of VMAs!
she was better with her sister
🔥🔥🔥
These live performances are AMAZING!!! 🤩 I LOVE U GUYS SO MUCH OMG 💕 👑
Beautiful ❤️
Halle style reminds me more of Janet Jackson
Amoooo
Yeah... let's just say this is the official video. Much better than the studio recording
VMA 2021?
Suena igualito a Arianna Grande 😂
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥🙏🏾
they're so shiny
fye
Great talent. However we all know who runs the record labels is the freemasons and this clearly shows by the name of the song,  It's pure satanic.
They kilt it ❤️
OMG!!! This so amazing :)
Y’all didn’t have to eat like this!!!! OMG!!!!❤️
My favorite song from them
Wow
Came back to watch this WHEN THEY PUT THIS IN THE FUCKING PRE SHOW NOW CHLOE WAS THE WHOLE DAMN SHOW THIS YEAR AS SHE SHOULD UGGH I LOVE THEM
How did we go from Ungodly Hour to Have Mercy? This was so much better
This is the Chloe I like!!! The new one is disgusting...
It’s the Triple Goddess moves for me Halle, this videos is amazing. B is a True Boss 🐝 👑
Can you believe this is the best Performance of the VMAS for the 2nd year in a row?
Just a year ago.. 🥵🥵
the performance we needed instead of softcore porn tampon gate LMAO
it;s been a year already ??
I like this song
They so talented and beautiful 😍 love them Together
I'm I the only African who hears the part ungodly hour as ananiangalia
the way that this is still iconic a year later. can’t believe the vmas did them dirty and put them in the pre show. this performance was amazing
Ungodly?
Beautiful
❤
my ears have been blessed 🛐 mis oidos han sido bendecidos 🛐
GOOO girllllllllllll gooooooooooo  Foots on our neck.
Wow. They're so talented and beautiful.  Their voices are amazing. 👏 👏 . I hope they never change their beautiful brown skin. 🤩✌
Halle is sooo graceful. Perfect duo❤️
These young ladies are so talented! They remain classy w/o being trashy. They've grown up in the public's eye & scrutiny of the World yet have not strayed away from what their parents taught them. They do not get the credit they deserve as young artist. I guess if you aren't cussing, promoting homosexuality, displaying drug use, less than 1/2 dressed or if you actually have talent you don't get recognized.
ughhhh they are so amazing!!
the TOP of the TOPS during the whole VMAS. this is actually better than the video, vocals included.
Halle is my best friend in my head

Whoever produced this did a fucking fantastic job. This wasn't a performance, it's a fucking party!!! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
I NEED A LIVE ALBUM LIKE YESTERDAY 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
This version definitely needed to be on their DELUXE version!!!!
They need to throw them out and bring out vanjess
Halle looked so beautiful IN THE LIGHTINGGGG so did chloe
This choreography was immaculate
Damn Halle 👌👌🔥🔥
Foda de escuta  primeira versão  é que depois vc só ouve ela
Man these young sister's blow my mind with their totally mad vocals♥️
Love the video but they could of just use  this amazing live performance as the video
Damn, the second that one of them does something super impressive with their voice and you think "wow, she's REALLY good in particular", the other one does something that is just as impressive in a completely different way. These two are otherworldly.
I watch this performance every day
What music needs goddesses
My epileptic attack was SO worth it.... <3
I can’t stand this girls but damn this is good
Guys I keep reapting this performance
this is the best rendition of this song by far
They do not MISS !!!! This is what artistic excellence looks like
Y’all gotta stop idolize celebrators you have Father in heaven that love and wants you
Beautiful
Love it, thank you for what you do !!!
They’re so demonic
how the hale is the live version better than the studio version
Every month i come here and i get blown away every time CHLOE X HALLE IS THE FUTURE OF MUSIC
When will they have a concert!!! Tour or something
they must have insane breath support cause damn they sound so stable
Perfect
I KEEP COMING BACK HERE I LOVE U BOTH UGHHH
the live is better than the official recording wha?? incredible vocals and a timelessly beautiful song
I always come back here
Okay hear me out, Chole and Halle, Doja Cat, SZA, and Jhené Aiko👀
Who calling at this unglodly hour.
Absolute perfection. Both separately and together. Really love seeing these two and all their talent and blessings
their performances are INSANE
MY JAW IS FOREVER DROPPED
this is simply amazing and i am speechless
Who are the 2,1k people who disliked this? I'd like to call all your parents and ask when the parenting went wrong.
I’m not the only one who hears Ariel here right? 2:38
Perfeitas pra carai
This is a true duo, voices that have grown together make the best sounds. We're so used to manufactured and they are truly just so refreshing
I think this remains to be one of my favorite performances I’ve ever seen! SO EPIC! 😍
This is so beautiful 😭
I have daughters and I would protect these two with my life. They are utterly beautiful and amazing and highly talented. Ive streamed this video all day long 💜💜💕💕💕💖
OK. ❤
Ungodly hour for some reason feels so holy
They eat their cds
I‘m obsessed with the „Love Me“ part and the way the high note blends in at the end.
😳 I feel like I  got assaulted with talent. Good lord . They are like beautiful sirens! Hypnotic and Sensual. Strong and Mighty. Graceful and Regal. And shiny ✨!🤩 Y’all keep doing your thing Madams!
Chloe is soooo sweet
u telling me this is a LIVE AND NOT A STAGED MUSIC VIDEO? I'm done
🖤
I like this video a lot better than the official one. These two can do no wrong I love everything they do. I can't wait for the little mermaid to come out. It's a shame only one sister can play Ariel🧜🏽‍♀️
My 5th time watching this video
the fact that i consider this as the official mv of the actual song says a lot
I love yall with everything in me .
Halle:😊😇🧚✨🦋🌼💫 Chloe:😫✋😩🤚👁️👄👁️
Just art so beautiful
So close to 8M .. been here since day 1 babeyyy
2:23 AAAAHHHH 😍
This is my favorite arrangement of this song
Halle just looks so serene. 🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍
This is their best ungodly hour performance hands down!
2:15 When that light hits their faces❤️❤️❤️
This is it!!! 😍🤩
I'm more impressed with the bg music of that engine.
People who listened to this had an eargasm 😌✨💫
Apart from The live being shot on Tenisha, Where the rest of them credits at?Camera works, Lights, Band, Dj, Both, MUA, Hair,Costume?
I love this song, it speaks to my soul.
They have been prepping Chloe for solo got a while now.
It’s the fact this was the pre show this was the best performance
They are so talented
I want to know the ppl that disliked this. Like Whyyyyyy?
They murdered this 🥰
“VMAS….welcome to the ungodly hour.” so iconic
The mere tights additionly jail because parrot decisively trace afore a snotty form. male, special gun
women
No, Halle. No you do not know any of my secrets 👀
what king sejong the great saw on his deathbed
Só eu achei essa versão melhor que a do clipe?
These girls kill it black is so beautiful 😻
This song is beautiful it’s my first time listening
their outfits foreshadowing the chrome edition of their album luv them
Is it just me, or does this sound like it came straight out of Carol and Tuesday?
Ladies it is not too late to release this on streaming services! Read the comments, the people want it!
I NEED THIS ON SPOTIFY, I'M TIRED OF COMING TO YOUTUBE JUST TO LISTEN TO IT!!!! PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN!
THEY ARE SO FUCKING DOPE!!!!!
Beyonce vibes all day I love them 😍!!

I was listening to WAP and I came over here to heal my ears.
Nice blending of voices  Wow. Performance.
The sweltering pancake indisputably entertain because food perioperaively flap qua a icy waterfall. tight, ragged ghana
Beyonce & Solange all over again.
i’m back again
What are those lights called that make the ring around them??
Put this on spotify plsss🤧🤧🤧
Como superar o INSUPERÁVEL
ICONIC
Omg 🛐🛐

Incrível o talento

Live version is way better than the audio.
ToP 💯
Como assim já se foi 9 meses
Those added beats make a world of difference
2:16 fave part.
they have the best voices ever like they dont need any auto tune omg
The womanly lake intradurally head because waiter conversantly radiate inside a dizzy german. wretched, hushed notebook
anyways the grammys are racist and there has not been a better pop/r&b album since ungodly hour
The elegance and the brightness the two serve it's ASTRONOMICAL. Exaggeratedly talented beauties.
They are so cute.
I’ve been a fan since they completed on Disney. They have ALWAYS been talented. I need mid rona to leave cuz I need to see these ladies live
I love
wow.
Yeet
I WOULD PAY BIG $$$ FOR A HOLOGRAM DEVICE OF THIS PERFORMANCE
Fantastic
These young women make their live performances so absolutely perfect and wildly high quality that they supercede even their official videos. I LOVE this and I find it to be the best version, bar none. <3
I love them and I'm 9
Why i have only listen this bop now ??
two angels on earth!
how did they do that with so much ease?
Not me rewatching it 20 times in a row 😭🤚🏾 this song is so good
This was amazing to watch and hear first time watching and the performance shocked me I can’t imagine how long y’all practiced this 😭
I cant stop watching this
Epoustouflantes !
Criminally good.

1:47
This is still the coolest thing anyone's done in years.
THESE TWO ARE TOO TALENTED
album version doesn't do it after this one. just hits so much harder <3
Can’t believe the sisters from brownish could sing like this together or that they made this song 😆
2:38
the power of halle bailey—
"cant fool me", my mind every time i try to not to comeback to this vid
i read all comments while pressing space repeatedly when the song's ended
Touches on that gleaming energy MJ "rock wth you," gave me. Electric
They should release this version, it’s so good
why do i fr like this more than the studio recorded version
i'm clean for years til i get high by this vid
How can you dislike this performance 🤍✨
i actually need this version on spotify because it's slightly different but it has sth that I like moreeee
They need to add this version to streaming apps! Its got an UMPH to it!

*L O V E   M E    L O V E   M E    L O V E   M E*

WOW????#??w? IM IN LOVE
Wow 😪the nostalgic vibes in this song ❤️
These girls are just truly amazing!! And to be so young .. these beauties are living legends already!! Such a sight to see!!
Okayyyyy... How has no one acknowledged Halle Bailey’s ability to slow down time? Those ethereal time stopping runs/riffs (2:59 & on) literally felt like she caused a shift in time that only she was aware of!!!!   And then when you look at it as a combined might??? Chloe Bailey hitting us with the staccato ad-libs giving us so many levels and another time zone?????   UgHhhh to be Chloe x Halle and be so damn CONNECTED TO THE ART LIKE THISSSSS????? 😫🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
THOSE VOCAL RUUUNNNSSS
They are truly talent and need to be highly appreciated. No gimmicks or scandals just all around talent.
I’m only listening to the live version from now & now
There are so beautiful and talented go my black sister Yasss 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥰💯
Don't separate them. Stop constantly comparing them. They are both beautiful and are great singers with great talent.
I thought of " welcome to the sweetener world tour " when I heard "welcome to the ungodly hour"
lovely this it.

I love them omggg
No lie Halle voice gives me chills it’s so angelic and beautiful and Chole makes a statement
Fuck the mainstream acknowledgment! The people out here knows how legendary these two will be
1:07 😏
*"Vmaaaaas"* have the same vibes as *"Todaaaaaaay sHowwww"*
Dem trills, dough.
How is this not a music video? Coz this is🤯😍
Chloe rarely takes the higher harmony this different lol
To rap moster in bts your rap.is fuck up.and you never ever  rap like kendrick lamar he black not you .

DIVINAS 💙💙
lindooooooooooooooooo
halles run around 3:06 does it for me
Superior version🙏🏼❤️❤️❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They are fucking incredible
Halle's "love me love me" and Chloe's note after that sends me to heaven.
the most iconic "VMAs"  me thinks
thats right sisters!
We need this version on Apple Music PUUHHHLEEAASEEEEEE. It’s too good the vocals !!!!!
Waiting for Bey x Chloe x Halle
BABBBBBBBBES U SLAYED
I Love Chloe & Halle Equally As Separate... 💋💚
Literally giving me chillllllssss
Yessssssss😍😍😍😍
Best vma performance 100%
Not really  sure about  how I feel about this  ,weird  that  was my first  impression...
They just show that they can always give that bit more. Their tiny desk session is perfectly intimate with levels and layers which they showed in this performance. I am going to keep watching for these little stars. So amazing! 🥰🙌🏽
Talento puro
Really rude for VMAs to hold an award show during a Chloe x Halle concert :/
Maravilhosas 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Imagine how uncomfortable those clothes are TvT
They both need to repent and so does everyone who supports this demonic influenced music
This is how you know these Queens can sing because they sound the same if not better live than on the album. Your fav could never you hear me🤌🏽

I literally watch this everyday as soon as I wake up😭
2:31 😍😍😍
if u wanna ascend to heaven pls go to 2:23
Omg some artists are not good at singing live cos in music vids they use autotune but chloe x halle have natural talent. Their voices are phenominal and out of this world. You two are my inspiration
i listen to this song at least once a day. is that bad? lol
This was my favorite performance of the VMA's hands down!!  Beautiful and the vocals were amazing!!  🥰🥰😍😍😍
The category is Aluminum foil realness 🤍🤍🤍🤍
ironically, this is incredibly godly
Very innovative
This should be the official version. Its just musically superior to the MV version.
Ridiculously talented.  They did the damn thing the entire year of 2020.  Just showed out.
i got complete goosebumps y'all. like this shit made me feel some way that i can describe but it was amazing..
I cant get enough of this!
The note at 3:06😭🖐️❤️
This hits differently with the tin clashing!! so goodd
i cant listen to this song unless it’s this vid
WITH CONTENT, BEAUTY, AND MYSTERY
I CAN DIE
Honey vocals and amazing performance, wow!
PERFECTION 💯
I have watched this an ungodly amount of times....
Those are some baaaddd lil girls.❤💯 I say that because I'm a senior but I love these sisters.
they are that bitch, like everything abt them is just bueatiful
2:23 oh my....
Different bodies cause idk y ya givin me low eyes like rihanna fade bitch e dat daddy teachinq u thought of astronomy so tell i 😎 don't 🤥 cause i see men every honor lemmie knowja 📿 like damb girl we oinq daddies routine .. Letsvtellvgreg but w/ eyes LAL
2:23 I keep repeating this part, I hope Disney release little mermaid this year 😭
The vocal arrangement is ALL Beyoncé. I love it and they DID THAT!
Insane 🤯🤯🤯
IF NO ONE GOT ME, I KNOW Chloe x Halle "Ungodly Hour" VMAs GOT ME. CAN I GET AN AMEN?
This song man 🔥🔥
this is what the grammys should have looked like
Their Live performances seems to always better than their videos..wow, they are true gems 💎
this song reminds me of a memory i have never experienced
❤️❤️❤️
But I wonder why Halle don’t need the transparent bra straps
I could watch them all day
its 3 am and im crying of how beautiful this performance is
And I forgot to mention the “Afro-Futurism”!  They should be in a film, Black Barbarella-esque, saving the earth.
I’m straight. But Halle gaze is soooo captivating
grabe kau mga teh
Got to give it up to Halle, what a voice, Chloe is a great singer, but giving that Beyoncé vibe, but Halle is so clean and pure with her voice!
Amazing Performance, they give me life, ever and ever.
On Jesus Christ 🥶
I love them... they are so dope.. 🔥🔥
They harmonise perfectly!  I was very late to the game, but I have watched this so many times, as well as reaction videos, because I wanted to see how others are getting this.  I have heard they sound like sirens, that they are almost singing like one person (each knowing just what to give) and they give a give an otherworldly vibe: celestial & sirens, Halle with those falsetto chops, it’s haunting and very Minnie Riperton which also kinda gives me a 70s vibe.  I have not seen a video where the people weren’t blown away.  This is my favourite song in a long while, can’t wait to blast it in the car!  BTW, this is somehow better than the video!
TBH I LISTEN MORE TO THIS THAN ITS MUSIC VIDEO. LOVE THE LIVE VOCALSSSS  AND THEIR VISUALS.
This is one of the best live performances  and has raised the standard for ever 😶😍
This is one of the best live performances ever and has raised the standard 😶😍
The Muses of Hercules= ChloexHalle AND Beyonce
Halle’s voice is like heaven 😍😍😍
It is so OMG! sz
Honestly I think two of, if not THE, best vocalists at the moment like WOW and HOW ARE THE SO GOOD! Like melted gold and crystal flowing into my ears! And to keep such stable vocals when dancing so strongly and phenomenally?! They blow my mind. I am so in love with this performance and Chloe and Halle’s music, god. So grateful.
I haven't felt this way for an artist for a long time. They captured me completely and I literally felt my heart stir. Wow.
Halle is sooo smooth ... love it 🥰. Chloe absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful
This was better than the actual music video that was released ♥️
I actually can't listen to the studio version anymore because this live version is SUPERIOR!
♥ _ ♥
I’m convinced this is the music video except better somehow😩
... the two sisters look so similar yet one(Halle) carries a feminine and soft vibe while the other(Chloe) has a strong, sexy vibe. I mean, I love both of them and I adore how the two can look alike and be so distinctly different!!
Excuse me while I pick up my whole jaw.
when they look into the camera... i literally melt
i keep coming back to this version... everything about this performance is beyond perfect
all these make me feel like am inlove while being single
This is my new love-making soundtrack.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥lit
This is my Fav version wayyyyy better than the vid
Way to leave me wanting more.
cant take my eyes off of chloe theyre both so good!!! 🥺🥺
Im really trying not to like this
1.9k r either racist, don't know music, or just hate Women...this was a Michael jacksoness performance.ijs
It’s the VMA performance for me
It sucks they didn’t win a Grammy
They are so ahead of their time😭. We don't deserve these young ladies. Performances are so good. ❤❤❤

I wish this was the original version
I come back to this video everyday like it’s so *chef kiss*
Can't help myself coming back for more
This is what a Grammy should look like
Sorry but I need a stay this out loud but you cannot compare these two both of them to Beyonce they are on a whole different level 2021 these girls are going to be legendaries
Every month I come back to watch this because it’s just THAT addictive
Robbed
AND Y'AL ARE TELLING ME THEY DIDNT SNATCH THE GRAMMYS AWARD?? BULL MANNNN
live version, better than recording.  HOW?
I can’t believe they didn’t win a Grammy
😍😍😍😍
I am still waiting for a single verison of this performance to be released
This performance should have been grammy nominated. Period.
I'm pressed that they did not win a Grammy.
Robbed at the Grammys or should we say scammys🙄
I just know Beyonce watches this video every night before bed lol
One question: are they real? Their look and performance is so surreal.
MAGNIFIQUE  morceau  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I like the live version more than the studio version
It’s impossible to have a favorite, they both are amazing and they compliment each other so well
Ik u guys will never see this but thank you for taking me away from that dark space in my life
How am i just seeing this?? Getting mad Sweet Dreams vibes from this... Bey must be proud
I will murder everyone if these girls don't start topping every chart that exists
Halle is giving us those eye's! They know they are doing the damn thing. I'm here for it all. Beautiful voices ladies!
When they say "Love me at the ungodly hour" ITS THE BEST THING EVER
im in class right now listening to this
Whoever say Chloe doesnt have range bring them here
🐝🐝🐝
❤❤❤
The performance was amazing. This is on my playlist on repeat 🔂 .
Why did i think this was the actual video I’m a new fan btw
lindas <3
The quality of this performance is so amazing I was confused when the music video came out cuz I though that what this was
Clones
So FRIGGGGGGING FLY!
i’m back for my daily dose of this video
This should’ve been the video because whew! They ate this up!
this so fucking beautiful
omg harmony <3
Lowkey gives me MJ vibes
Knowing that Disclosure produced this makes everything make sense. No wonder it hits the way it does.
Omg this song don't make sense what is going on here 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
They sound better then the recording
🥰❤️😍💘😻💗😘💜💙🖤💛🧡💚🤘🏾🤍👌🏽 I love you my mom I love you too.
This should be their outfit on their MV
Perfeitas 🇧🇷💚
F***ing Angels
Ummmmm NO NO NO NO NO THEN WAIT....THEN A HELL NO AFTER THAT 🤣😂🤣
This is a beautiful song ❤️
Im so OBSESSED with this performance
Beautiful! 💥💥💫💯 👯🏾‍♀️
I came back
IDC which version I watch, I’m screaming VMAAAAS
“VMA’S” repeats in my head atleast 20 times a day
é normal gostar mais da performance do vmas do que o clipe?
#
Came back to watch and listen to this for more chloe and halle🥺❤️💕
Love me some them such talented women
Chloe is more of dominating and fierce performer Halle has an ease very mild but yet striking
Elegance
This version just hit different. I’ll keep coming back to it
Metropolis. Bey did a metropolis theme as well in one of her concerts.
Chloe knows how to dance bb💯
Ao vivo melhor ainda meu deussss
<3 I like this version & video of this song the best!
This shit UNBELIEVABLE. My jaw dropped. I’m amazed by their voices, those lights, those beats—crazy stuff. Perfect performance!
Beyonce's influence  r&b from 90 's  is back
Halle's "love me, love me" convinced me she has the Disney princess voice
Baby, baby, won't you, won't you, .... that little riff stays stuck in my head. 2:59
They are like the gift that keeps on giving. They both have their own flavor and vibe and I like and appreciate them separately and together. The visuals! Then the vocals are soooooo clean and just ahhh! I feel like this is what Beyonce and Kelly would've been like as a dou but Chloe is next level. When I say we aren't ready for Chole Bailey you better take note. The world is NOT READY for Chloe!!! Their Duo and solo careers are gonna take on wings like we've never seen. I love these two soooo much!!!!
I’ve been watching this literally all day nonstop
Performance of the year! Yes, i said it!!!  Much better than official video!!!
This should have been the official video tbh.
واو، أصواتهم رائعه
I come back to this performance often.  PURE PERFECTION 😍
Por deus que perfeição
2:44 idk why it’s so satisfying when Halle said yeahhh 😫💖💖
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH, I just wish it was 4K, it would be even more stunning 💎
And they keep give fresh vocals for the lives... COME ON NOW!!! Hitting  the pitches!!! AND THE HARMONIES...
Whenever I hear this song, the wind starts blowing. I hear chimes and feel a breeze and I feel like I’m in a different dimension. ☺️☺️☺️🥰 I love these two goddesses!! 😍
The utensils dancing during Be Our Guest in Beauty and the Beast
this is the 3rd time ive watched this in an hour
Oh my gosh, they’re cute x
Halle is so smooth
Whoever thinks that Halle doesn't deserve to be Ariel after that "love me love me love me love me" moment, bitch that person needs jesus!!!
They are NOT to be played with
I think Chloe should let Halle have some shine sometimes...but Chloe has a big personality like me tho lol😂 so she like all the shine and attention, so I get it lol
This version is the best OMG !
Zhane vibes
Me tryna sing wit them but know.danm well CANT COMPRARE😞💗💗💗
This my fave version of this song. 😍
😍
the "vmas" in the beginning already gave me chills bro ...
They flow thru harmonies so seamlessly I can’t 😫😫 I love them
anyone can recommed other songs similar to this one?
their album was the best thing to happen to 2020 and this performance is just next level i'm sorry but i haven't seen anything this POPPIN in a while
I love y’all so much y’all inspire me to be myself! Thank you ♥️
Halle singing so unbothered
this is the best version of the song
@tagteam
I had to turn my brightness down to embrace this vid
Hi , I just posted a cover on my channel. Check it out if you don't mind thanks!!
THIS SHOULD OF BEEN THE MUSIC VIDEO
When they start shaking those hips to the beat.....that's when the trance starts. Not sure why they made another video for this song.
Queen Bey is playing no games when it comes to these 2
I'm obsessed with Chloe's voice
I love this more than the new music video. Idk why.
heaven
Yo. This is one of the Flyest performances Ever!! Halle caught me the first half then I couldn't stop watching Chloe! She's got such energy and a dynamic  spirit. She hitting hard and ticking and popping but making Angelic airy notes and ablibs like its  nothing. These girls are in a whole other league. 🔥 🔥 🔥 FIRE
their harmony is godly. God said so himself bc I went there during this holy performance! straight facts!
At this point Chloe is definitely little Beyoncé! She has her range plus more! If Beyoncé and Solange performed together back then this would definitely be them 💯
Something about Halle's eyes at 2:50 just get me everytime I watch this.
They should have just made this the official music video for Ungodly Hour tbh
Y'all should see them in grownish
everything they do is effortless and graceful
halle looking at the camera and chloe giving attitude have me dying in the inside
The lie/its all gods hours if he take just one we all dead(truth) that got leaked!!!
I come back and I'm reminded they don't put out their live performances on other platforms - some days I need the extra runs and the switch ups 😩
I Stan these girls but is it just me who preferred this to the actual music video and song? 😍🔥
I'm the only one who thinks this is better than the original song?
Y'all voices make my soul melt I love y'all💙💙💙💙
The little ones a little more effortless
Chloe's runs of "love me" are therapeutic.
Chloe is such an amazing performer and singer she makes every angle be vibrant but I can't look away from them both. I guess I just need to buy all their albums. 💖
Got chills
honestly i seen this 1st an thought it was the video..lol btw i was BLOWN AWAY!!!
@ChloeXHalle can you release this live version on Spotify x Apple Music please?
Best 👏🏽 Performance 👏🏽 of 👏🏽  2020!
you can really hear discosure produced this one
I legally oblige myself to watch this everyday. 🔥
who is here after the mv was released?
I love this better than the official video.  No shade. This was just a classic iconic mood. It's a perfect painting.
Too good for the world
I have never seen any artist perform the live version better than the record... I like their live versions better than their recorded versions. These girls are stupid talented!
LOVE this!! The instrumentation is giving me Lonnie Liston Smith vibes.
I feel like they just stole my soul 🥴
🙌🏿🙌🏿
This is the best live performance EVER!!!!!!
2:15 An Angel. :)
I have literally listened to this song over 10 times today. They are like Zhane with better vocals.
the missing forks mom complains about:
This version sounds better than the album version.. and the album version is already amazing! These girls are incredible!

(Love me at the ungodly hour)
This my favorite rendition 💜💜
They sound even better live!!!!
So talented!! I love it, get it Ladies!! #Melanin🥰
I love this song!!! Their Vocals are Phenomenal, they have great harmony!!!!
just paid attention to the actual lyrics... WOW. I LIKE IT EVEN MORE NOW!
visuals, set design, lights, choreography, wardrobe... everything about this video is on point.
in my humble opinion, this version is a thousand times better than the original, I keep listening, the two of you singing is so beautiful, I follow inspiration for me and my brother to sing, thanks for this such beautiful working 💖😭
Them vocals ♥️😍
Came back here after the video dropped. This IS STILL THE VIDEO. Period. The vocals, the look....not sure why they even decided to shoot a video after this iconic take on the song.
The fact that the official video is finally out, but this performance is still supreme! 🏆
Harmoniesss😍😍😍😍
My favorite version of this song!
Ungodly Hour? The world is in a bad place when it's things this that people support. Protect your kids eyes and ears. Talented girls yes, but satanic music indeed
love me at an ungodly hourrrrr
HERMOSAS
So effortless
The live  performance kinda hit harder than the vid tbh that's rare
VMAS WELCOME TO THE UNGODLY HOUR
I need this version in the Deluxe album cuz i know there will be
Chloe X Halle can sing
Chloe be giving me some MJB vibes at the end. Halle...no words...these 2 are so dynamic and captivating all at once
This was so damn beautiful
cannot get over how PHENOMENAL they are holy holy SHIT
The video out y'all finally.
VMA'S...love the way she says that
This video is better than official music video.
Yessss
😘😘😘
yes there is new og video for the song..but this takes the cake
One of the best of 2020 and still playing hard on 2021. Check my reaction for this vid and my short films on https://youtu.be/4-XUcwsKz7o
Love them 😍
Still not over these outfits and this performance. Wish someone of these moves made it into the official video that just released!
I will be the only one who still does not pass the .. " *VMAs Welcome To The Ungodly Hour* " I really can never get over this presentation
If you don’t say “VMASSS” everytime, you don’t love this song
Who's here after the music video?
They be sleeping on you Chloe and Halle but your killing this shit. This is fucking fire..... go head baby girls. drops mike!
Everything 💚💚💚💚
😍😍😍😍
Who here after the premiere of the music video?
Here after the video premiere
2:23 to 2:32. You'll thank me later.
im back again-
I love these queens so much
UNGODLY HOUR
Giving me janet jackson vibes definitely. Love the performance :)
I'm obsessed
This song not having over 100 million views should be a crime☹️ this performance is underrated and deserves more views
3:04 it’s they little walks and riff rafts 😍
I can’t believe this is ‘just’ a performance video 💀 can’t wait for the official video for Ungodly Hour coming out this week!
Wat they done turned these girls into smh
Why do i feel like im on my way 2 heaven when i hear these two sing😂🔥
I’m back again
This girls are awesome ♥
I swear I watch this daily like it's water.
Turns out these girls are the #1 pop stars in wakanda. People were angry at how fierce they were. So they were banished from the kingdom. Now it seems they want them back. They don't want the secrets of afro-futurism and positive vibes to exploited. I hope they stay here!!!¡🤗
The music video is coming this week! This was a serve already tho
i’m supposed to be studying but instead i’m watch this.
Can’t wait for the mv
When Chloe said "I wish that you could back it up on me,me me" and the face she made, I felt that
That “I don’t have the time DUN DUN” gets me everytimeeeeee
This has been playing daily for the past 5 days. In my head 🥲🥲🥲🥲.
Halle would be such an amazing jazz singer😩
This is what you see at the gates of heaven.
Poor babies they are sold out to the illuminati..poor babies
i keep watching this. i-
the way i love these incredible women damn

If the live performances are better than the studio versions of the song then that means they are more than talented
that outro!!!
halle saying “love me” at 2:23 is so smooth, and then chloe’s runs after she says that are on point
THERE VOICE 🥰 Just SICK!!! IN A GREAT WAY! They need to do a live musical as princesses 🤣 Yall remember when it's was Brandy as Cinderella and The Amazing Whitney Houston as Fairy Godmother?? I Need THEM ON THAT 🤣 OMG!! I LOVE YALL💖💖

It’s just something about this performance., like wtf?? PERFECTION is not a good enough word. No words can describe what this performance does to me, I get chills every time I watch it. I can’t even listen to the studio version anymore.
Can we talk about that run Chloe hit at 2:30?! 😩 Angelic.
Perfeitas
I was unable to look away from start to finish lmaoooo. Didn't even touch my phone
Just goosebumps all over my body when I look at this marvelous scene. There’s nothing ungodly about it. I see two women from above.

I can't listen to the original without thinking about this
I think this is my favourite performance of all time
Man this video always gives me goosebumps, watching them from when they did covers 6-8 years ago to this. Amazing journey and cant wait to see where they go!
This song is beyond hot!!
i watch this performance religiously
Wow! Ungodly hour amen!
i don't understand how they don't have more attention.  it's so irritating.
Wow! 🔥🔥🔥
Ungodly hour. It's 3am the devil's hour
Beyonce is sooooo proud! Amazing talent!!❤👏
this is so insane.
their voices are like honey
yes
*RENT FREE* periodt
I’m shook that the live version sounds better than the record!
Absolutely no one: The Kids that wreck me on Fortnite:
I love them and this is a great performance but it's pre recorded. It's not a bad thing. They can sing and deliver without pre recording but it's obvious that this is.
i just know their parents are so proud
Damn this performance was cold af!!!!
UGH such stunning voices.
We don't deserve them.
They killed it like damn 🔥🔥🔥
Ok but these looks?? PUURRRR
the way i come back to this at least once a week

The eatable adjustment preclinically moor because actor differently itch including a watery asia. cumbersome, outgoing shade
My gods

All I hear is Beyoncé 😂

I can't wait to see they saying "Grammy welcome to the ungodly hour"
so its how being talented looks like
omg i don't how many times i've watched this anymore
Hit me with your eyes I never seen that kind of view You walkin' over here The way that it went down, that's when I knew We be talkin' all night But I can tell you need to work on you, you, you Like you, you, you, like you Like you, mmm  You be playin' sweet But, baby, don't you know that talk is cheap Can't fool me I wish that you could back it up for me, me, me Like me, me, me, like me  You know that I, I heard it all before You're hesitant, but you could give me more I know you like to play those silly games When you're done, call my name  When you decide you like yourself (Holler at me) When you decide you need someone (Call up on me) When you don't have to think about it Love me at the ungodly hour When you decide you like yourself (Holler at me) When you decide you need someone (Call up on me) When you don't have to think about it Love me at the ungodly hour  I don't have the time To teach you how to love all over again And let me ask you this Are you givin' all that you could give?

After watching it over 30 times, I think it was pre recorded as you can see how chloe exagerates her movements so it kinda gives it off a bit that it's not natural. Astonishing still💓💓
I am in love with the live version so much ❤️❤️
Their voices are so soft and angelic it gives me chills every time
who is who like who is chloe and who is halle im getting into their music
Jesus Black woman, I can't breathe without y'all blowing me away. Such queens 🙌🏾💞
I'm glad that they didn't get main stage tbh, if they did we'd be getting those stupid laugh box cheers disrupting this masterpiece
Love me at the ungodly hour is my fave part along with side glance
That IS NOT a performance. That is a MUSIC VIDEO.   AMAZING 👏👏👏
It's so hipnotazing
ironically, their voices sound like angels
this arrangement... plus this on Spotify. godly vocals.
My spoon and fork coming alive and performing when no one's around
✨MESMERIZING✨ ❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️

Y’all talking about their singing but did you know that they had full STYLE EVERY VIDEO, like I could never do that.
Performed on 8/30/2020. It's 1/15/2021, and I AM STILL OBSESSED WITH THIS PERFORMANCE!

(Love me at the ungodly hour)
Been looping on this for days now!!
so goddesses really exist huh?
When I first saw this performance I literally cried, I was sooo fucking proud
This is the best performance I think I’ve ever seen on TV. It’s like art. I wish this version was still on Spotify. Got all my colleagues at work listening to this on repeat on YouTube.
THE REAL CRIME is how is this version not on the album??????? I want both-
Que talentos!
OMGGGGGG THEY'RE LITERALLY WORTH TO STAN!!!!!!!!!! AM I TOO LATE FOR THIS??? :(((
This video & song will forever be linked with M-House by Japanese architecture firm SANAA in my mind. I was doing a research project on that house when I first found this video and had it on repeat basically the whole time I did my work... what a funny connection to have!
This performance have more views than the audio for reasons
I love the words love hurts
This is better than spotify version 😍😍
Chloe x Halle:*sings love me at the ungodly hour beautifully* Me and my besti: lUv mE AT tHE uNgOdLY hOuR
Someone release from the shackles of this video😭😭😭😭
Y’all are so pretty I mean prettyI wish I was just as pretty as you and you always calm me down
They'll make it to the top. An unstoppable force.
I love these two.  There is something so special when siblings sing together, they make heavenly music.  I have a weird auditory problem some pitches and sounds will make me feel nauseated and light-headed. I can't tolerate certain lower pitches in women that are often heard in gospel, country, and certain types of jazz (a huge disappointment to my jazz-loving father.)  Though I can't sing to save my life, my husband who is a musician, says I can't tolerate any offenses (is that a word?) in harmonies that to most is a simple artistic choice and makes music interesting.  I have never noticed that issue when siblings or children and parents are singing together.  I find these two so calming.
if i could give this 3 thousand likes myself i would 🙄
Halle looks like Halle Berry
✨✨✨✨VMAs✨✨✨✨😍
Ah, this is so heavenly
Vim aqui pelo gustavo
My daughter does her excercise to their latest album. I was like, "who is that?" Been hooked ever since. These young ladies are amazing. The new benchmark as far as I'm concerned.
bro this shit so hard
Can we talk abou that this is a major cultural reset and progress??????? This is pure gold!!!
2:23 wow <3
perfection
🤍🫂🫂🤍
playback ?
Best sister relationship ever!
how is that 'ungoldy' while they're wearing His skin color!
I think i'm bewitched by this song.
I love both of your voices my daughter listens to your singing all the time she loves to sing and your voices always clams  my 3 month old down and puts him to sleep. Thank you for your beautiful voices ❤️
Amazing. Phenomenal. Spectacular. Wonderful. Astounding.
Né que as meninas arrasam
The voice mermaid 🧜🏻‍♀️ omg 😱 mesmerized
The outfits remind me sm of "Queen of the Night" and I love it. Also this version sounds so good
i love the way chloe sings "when you decide you need someone" at 2:15
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)_
I wish all family had a relationship like this 🖤👽
They are so breathtaking omg... Truly goddesses, like how come that i got CHILLS with every song by them? Its just unreal!
They just remind me of some magical mermaids that sings and calms the world with their voices.
I was sleeping on these young ladies but Now I’m woke ❤️ them
WOW, Halle is the girl she thinks she is!!!! love her!
criminally underrated phenomenal
I have to sue🙅🏾‍♂️
i’m so in love with them like im obsessed omg
I feel like im in the year 2077 lmaooo So futuristic efgsjdfjsdfgaisdfvgsfg
help. i cant stop watching them. i have 3 unfinished tasks due tomorrow.
they deserve more loveeee
I love them so much, my new favorite. I'm a 70s baby so a lot of you probably don't know who I'm talking about however Chloe reminds me of Patrice Rushen she's an amazing artist from the '70s and '80s. Chloe looks just like her (hair and all) and their voices are spot on the same. Their Melody and Temple my Lord!! When they're singing it sounds like it's 13 different vocals however it's just 2 amazing vocals of Harmony singing so many different ranges.
The people who disliked the video, has no sense of taste in music PERIODT🦋❤️
eu amo essa musica velhooooooo, meu alarme <3
This gives me shivers
THIS is excellence.
Heaven. ♥️
O M G Halle chloe omg the end ..🤯🤯🤯🤯
I love how Chloe is so fierce while Halle is so graceful. They like yin and yang.
This performance was just, ugh  so good
amazing.
THE BIGGESTTTT5
COME TO BRAZIL
I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU

The murky disadvantage algorithmically remain because deal anaerobically annoy except a ruthless bed. guarded, dashing cent
Stan TWICE
The beauty of their vocals at 3:09 brings me to tears every time
This song lives in my head rent free 😥🥰
These 2 incredible ladies got me thru 2020 - really expect (and want) them to continue to hold it down
This performance always make me smile & sing along 😁 instant mood lifter
Chloe's moves are so sharp and Halle's is so chill and still kills it  They are such a beautiful,and perfect duo
damn, this is amazing
Instant classic and that’s on who ?
First time I heard this song thought it was a disclosure song, it sounded so disclosure to me, until I checked the writers and producers credits.
Chloe got me Love Vibes Halle got me Big Chills.. love

Excuse me, how are these two human beings so perfect.
let me guess, this is not the first time u came here.
I love this. Ive been sleeping on them!
Sad that they have to be overly sexualized. They're so young... also they don't need to show flesh and act sultery. They are oozing talent. Sad... so Sad!
Soooo. When’s official M/V coming out???
So freaking angelic
I love both of you heartily
2:39 don’t mind me i just cant stop rewatching this part
Anybody 30+ remember the girl duo Zhané from the 90’s? They’re the modern Zhane both have tremendous talent and staying power
Que chatas...nada de novidade. ..igual outras cantoras que cantam e dançam.
Q U E E N S
This is such a bop yall 😯😯😯
halle sounds like snow white to me in the beginning   especially when she said love me
💛💛😗👉👈

몇번보는지 모르겠네 너무 멋있다
This is live? I'm canceled because wow
MY FAVS💓
their set and costume designs are always so nice and I love looking at the geometric patterns in their outfits. Their backup dancers are always on point and (BI)POC and that makes the whole image with their music that much nicer, a marathon of watching their MVs has motivated me to give them a deeper look into their music. I'm excited
this is giving me very beyonce sweet dreams. especially the outfits
It's like 2 two little beyonce's.. cute but..
I can't explain it. There's something so iconic about them.
Watching this ladies all I see is queen b  remaking of herself for new generation 😄❤️👍
Pure talent. A whole package
10 out of 10!!!!!! Immaculate performance🎉🎉🎉🎉😭😭😭😭😭
i need these ladies to sing HAY MR DJ
I’m the 5,000,000 view 😍😍
Fuck this is legit perfect! Beyonce energy but somehow better
It's like their ancestors are moving through them . That's my observation. Scary!
They can't be real life.
flawless
<3
I love how Chloe shows how happy she is when performing
THE VOCALS!!!!
CHLOE'S RANGEEEEE😩SHE IS NOT ONE OF THEMMMM🙌🏾🙌🏾
Iconic performance💫💫
It’s pleasing me and my homegirl
I shouldn’t be watching this everyday tho, that’s a lil too much.... imma still do it tho
Their best song yet!
¿A quien le puede disgustar esto? ... Definitivamente hay gente que debe medicarse psiquiátricamente hablando.
Es español: ESTO ESTA QUE ARDE, ME ENCANTA <3
Just finished listening to ungodly hour, they are AMAZING 👏🏾
They give me a refreshing "ZHANE Vibes"
i'm still trippin because...HOW DO THEY DO THAT WITH THEIR VOICES? its so ETHEREAL.
I love this version
2:40 🔥
Amazing performance !
Every time I hear this song I always here "VMAs" in the beginning lol
Afrofuturism in its purest form
They are so underrated

Mood for 2021
🇧🇷😌👏👏👏♥️Magnificent!!
I listen to this everyday
So amazing 😻
This so...is everything!!! So romantic i loooove it
This performance is IT
They need to make an album called "Sirens" because that's exactly what they are.
I was looking for copper, then I literally found gold. This performance is so insane. I'm loving these queens
Why isn’t this version on Apple Music
They sexed them up so much. Talent.
Listened to this accidentally at 1.25 speed, and damn, what an experience
The harmony on “you” gave me tpain I’m sprung vibes..aside from that this was amazing they never disappoint very talented ladies
RENT FUCKING FREE
My favorite performance from them
Unpopular opinion... chloe is too intense in the last bit... just too much BUT like the song !!
They are so good!
Disclosure helped to produced this track. That why its the best of the album, you rules girls !
probally i've wachted this live video a hundred times
PLS put this live version on spotify!!! we LOVE to hear it!!
Can y’all post this in Apple Music please
Love this song so much!!!!
WHY ISN'T THIS A SINGLE
I found this song annoying it was to much going on in the vocals..They do have nice voices on slower rythmez..
I am speechless ✌
Surreal...
PORRA ISSO AQUI É PERFEITOOOOO MDS DO CEU CHLOEZINHA E HALLEZINHA
PERFEITASS
they mad fine
honestly....how have i not heard about them before this year. the talent is insane
Okay I’m still learning there voices and I’ve been sleeping on our girl chloe I always assumed she took the low notes but she be hitting them high notes just like Halle
I swear this is my daily vitamin.
I absolutely LOVE this song and video 💕💕
Can y’all believe Chloe is 21 and Halle is 19 like????? They look like 18 and 16 to me
oh god i didn't know i would be obsessed with them!!
When I listen to ppl who can sing really well I get tears in my eyes and chills is that just me ? Lol
I see what ya did there... a live performance and a music video at once!
very good performacne. thumbs up 👍👍👍👍
lindas <3
their voices are magical
i just love them so much
This is ICONIC, it has to be remembered as one of the most perfect performances. Also, why isn't this on Spotify???? the original version isn't enough for me anymore after this
Não consigo não escutar essa música algumas vezes ao dia
This is the performance of the year!
Their flow is so unusual by I also finish by bieng hooked ❤️. The lyrics are so relevant 😍
I hope heaven sounds like this <3
congratulations on your grammy nominations! well deserved for this masterpiece and your artistry!
This song a whole vibe 🎵🔥❤️
The fact that they sound so good live
Still trying to figure out how Taylor Swift is deemed an icon...
this performance is one of my favorites. they are already seasoned performers this early in the game. They each are unique but the same essence.. its amazing to see.  Chloe gives me direct power and fire. Halle is so demure and quietly powerful. I love the contrast between the two; equally powerful in very different ways.
THEIR ADLIBS!!!
This song is a vibe‼️‼️‼️‼️
natural daughters of Michael Jackson and Beyonce
2:30 my favorite vocal moment. Hand Chloe 🔥🎼
There voice's are magnificent!
Who is the one with the thigh game??!!! Sheeeesh
So aethetic I love it. Ear candy, even better. I love it that they sound the same. If you didn't know, you would think it's just one person singing.
holy shit
It’s their confidence for me
I watch every few days . I need my medicine
They are gorgeous, talented and fucking amazing performers. What's not to like?
The most iconic Chloe X Halle performance as of yet!
I love this song so much, it helps a lot when you're feeling insecure and just down. This song gives me security to just push myself to do better and love myself
Oh my this is amazing
this should be on their spotify
I wish i could like this video a second time.

I aint never seen two pretty bestfriends until now🥺🤧😍😍
Breathtakingly beautiful 🔥🔥🔥
To viciado
What’s this magic ? 😭💘
Man I actually think I’m starting to prefer this to the original
1 million of these views are mine
Best part of the show
Watch KPop copy it.
How do we get this version on Spotify?!?!?!??!
This reminds me of MJ’s: “Rock W/You” video w/them lightning effects!
the run at 2:31 is even better than the album. they are sooooo talented
I love How Halle looks at the camera and how Chloe got that powerful walk Like it’s perfect!!!
Y’all killed that!
PERFECT
i dont even want them to be mainstream...people dont deserve them!!!!
im still obsessed
THAT WAS JUST SO AMAZING THEY SLAYED THIS PERFORMANCE
This version slaps harder than the album version 🙌🏼🔥
Goosebumps
The fact that this has more views than the official video only goes to prove that they perform so well nobody even knew this was not the official video when they first found them🥵❤️
I love them!
Agh! 💦   Genius. Get it producing Queen B. Outdoes DC. Just by a gram 💨
Rolazaaaa
They both sound like Beyoncé I love their voices tho
These are the performers we need desperately but dont deserve.
I'm so obsessed
MTV took my girls for granted and now they’re Grammy nominated
THE LIVE ADLIBS I —
Did I mention that I literally love them???
ACTUACIONES LADIES CODE SUPER CHICOS YASMINA TEO SABELA DANIELA SUPERVIVIENTES 2014 Y MUCHOS MAS

Chloe's hair is so unappreciated....
Chloe with the thickness though 😱
So damn good. Love it
I'm not giving God up for anything, especially an average song like this. Praise Jesus. Show respect for your Creator. I give this song 777 thumbs down
Bad
IT'S SAD FOR ME AND HOMEGIRL NOT SEEING THEM GET MORE VIIEWS
ABSOLUTELY STUNNING
People saying they see Beyoncé, but all I see is Michael and Janet Jackson in this!!😍💕💕
💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
One of my all time fav performances. Ever!!
NICE
It's just two talented women wrapped in silver and flashing lights, but it's still my favorite performance of all 2020
I love their harmonies, their stylistic choices, and tone...however I must also say that I love this song because that synth ostinato is really similar to the Super Mario 64 underwater theme x)

trash song
best performance of 2020
Halles vocals and Chloes everything is giving me life. I’m on view 197,000 I’m addictive. Chloe is like on fire in this performance period... every move is felt and ferocious. #queens
PERFECTION
I'm trying to understand how there are so many thumbs down doe this....like are you bored and just don't like nice things?
The second that laser turned on I was just like yep I’m deceased! Vocals SLAYING!
I wish  they be in "Carole and Thusday" as some sasy characters:D
Why are these two so perfect! I cant believe how good they are LIVE! <3 OBSESSED!
I love how Chloe hits the dance move hard, efficiently, and perfectly and Halle has a more elegant flow way of dancing. Its a perfect duo😍 I really hope they dominate this music industry together and don't end up separating.
Love it
quality music
The amount of times I have rewatched this is unhealthy.
AMAZING
They deserve more recognition and attention like come on!
This gives me queen of the night vibes and there harmonies gives me chills lawd this is pure talent ✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽✊🏽
2:32 a-ma-ZING!!
this is still their best performance for UH
I am here for the tenth time and I am aware that it will not be the last time
Chloe should really do ASMR! Just after saying, "VMAs!," she should really do ASMR, she'd be amazing at it!
Sim eu serei aquela pessoa que pergunta onde estão os brasileiros
As a Chinese, I feel like home listening to this music
I still think that Chloe is saying "Be amazed~" at the start.
elas são o momento
Who is here after seeing the people’s choice award performance
omg, they invented speaking in cursive.
ughhh ang galing nilaaa
why have i watched this 100 times
😗👍
Jesus is the way the truth and the life. God sent his only begotten Son so that you can have everlasting life. Place your faith in Jesus. Trust Jesus. Jesus Christ. Jesus saves. Jesus conqueres. Calvary Cross. The Blood. Salvation. Gospel   God bless all

Sickening, and served with the extreme production value too, we live!!!
I can't tell what's more beautiful them or their vocals.

If they do a movie about the life of Beyonce... Chloe should casted... she has the body and vocals
Halle is 'I am' and Chloe is 'Sasha Fierce'
QUEENSSSSSS
They have to make it big.... I love their voices and vibe.....pure talent!
Thank goodness I did my daily pass through the video, I wouldn't have forgiven myself if I hadn't done it. I love them
I’m so glad that they’re being the recognition they deserve. Performances everywhere 🤍🤍🤍
rent free
are they even real?!
Sound track for the lil mermaid anyone
Amei parecem hologramas sabe aquelas divas de filme futurista
I'm obsessed 😍
anyone else prefer this live version to the studio version? I love them drums synched to the choreography
This is definitely Beyoncé inspired 😩😭
This is the real deal right here! Very, very strong Janelle Monáe à la _The Archandroid_ audio meets Beyonce à la "Sweet Dreams" sexbot visuals here. Plus the title itself is great. Freaking spectacular all the way around!
I play this video on TV every time I do the cleaning
To the people thatve been coming for months we finally hit 4 million🥳
there 4 million views, I swear 1 million are mine! This  song is fire! Incredible how they sound even better than in the studio version! Goddesses!!
the live version is so angelic ✨
Plus eins
chloe and halle >>>>>>>>>>>>>>> everyone else in the pre-show.
when halle sang "love me" the ariel just came out istg
This video is giving me beyonce's I am sasha fierce vibes. Particularly the "'sweet dreams" music video.
Gente a voz de Halle é uma explosão de perfeição, parecem anjos cantando, sua leveza para cantar , sem preocupação, um grito gostoso de ouvir completamente
operator i think we lost control of flight 247 to mars ...
So we gonna talk how HALLE WAS SERVING LOOKS THE WHOLE PERFORMANCE?!🤔 Y’all better WERK👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏾
I love their voices and energy,  but I UTTERLY hate how whoever managing them, is giving them the Whore look. They're too classy and decent for this sort of Hollywood, Music Industry degeneracy. I'm truly disappointed. who ever's responsible for their image should immediately be Fired
gosh they’re like tlc but like... modernized and more afrofuturistic
I’m sorry but this is one of the best songs they made
Both Amazing! ..BKnows💞
I literally watch this once a day MINIMUM!!
they are in their mood love iiiittt
patiently waiting for this to hit 4 million. i’ve been here everyday since 3.2 million
Pretty girls... I love this song.. 🥰😍😘
When the bard who wears plate armour rolls a nat 20 in performance  (idk i gotta contribute to the algorithm)
💙💙
GIRLS, you are BEAUTIFUL 😁😁
This is one of my favourite live performances ever
They're actually so talented. Power duo.
this gotta be kaytranada production
THEYRE ON A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL THAN ALL THESE WESTERN MUSICIANS
Who else is here from netherlands
The balance between the two is amazing to watch and hear. It's like watching and listening to a painting come to life.
Chloe is my absolute shit <3 <3 <3 <3
1:40 took me all the way out
Halle’s “love me, love me” is so calming to me.
who else say "VMAS" when listening to the regular audio lol
THE BEAT
im soooo mad this wasnt in the main show. i was waiting for it wtf!!!
THE TALENTTTTTT
Halle is mystery. Chloe is power. Together they're unstoppable.
DIOSAAAAASSSSS LAS AMOOOO
the 90s just called, they want their proceeds from the video back
this is so so sos so so so iconic they're too good
Very impressive
Love the video great job 👍👍 ✌️❤️to everyone hope everyone is safe and well
I'm assuming that's 3AM right!
❤❤🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥❤❤❤❤🔥❤❤🔥❤❤❤🔥❤❤🔥❤❤🔥❤❤❤❤🔥❤🔥❤❤❤❤🔥❤❤🔥❤❤❤❤🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥❤❤❤🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥❤❤❤❤❤🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥❤❤   I tried🤷🏽‍♂️⚡🔥❤😍
They're wonderful. 🌠🌠
VMAAAAASSSSSS AAAHHHHH I LOVEEEE
❤
I love these outfits and the aesthetic with the old-style mics so much
I’m getting brandy vibes!
Love this duo. Such an amazing performance. I'm obsessively watching all their live performances 😂  Got into psychology. They are singing about someone with an avoidant attachment style. If you are in love and this song resonates with you because it's that frustrating, look it up. ❤
to be honest this is better than the original song.
i watch this religiously every night before going to sleep
Halle does give out feminine and calm vibes, she can definately be a Disney's princess.
You’re so beautiful it makes me wish I was straight 😱 magnificent
A very talented girls, beautiful, Black girls magic people yassss, that’s it. Love this so much.
That are always united ❤🙏🏽
MEUDEUS AS PATROAS FAZEM TUDOO
I have to watch this at least once a day to feel something.
half of the views are from me
they are soooooooo unique and talented, don't need the over the top outfits or gimmicks, as soon as they sing one note, they command attention. You wanna see more
i could love these ladies at any hour- just name it
THESE ARE MERMAIDS😭😭!
Eu não me canso de ver essa performance, que ódio
Their outfits, their hip movements and "vmas welcome to the ungodly hour" has no business living rent free in my head.
what the actual FKuk they are the godly ones
This is 2021 Energy
THESE BITCHES GIVE ME MY DAMN LIFE I CANT STOP WATCHING NOW IM DOING THE DANCE IN NY BATHROOM TRYING TO SHAVE
Ahhh Im back again, this whole performance is flawless , the lighting costume , arrangement everything... it’s my feel good favorite..... one of the best performances in the history of performance period 💗💗💗😭😭😭👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Sasha Fierce had a daughter & named her Chole! 🌟
The production of this. Choreography, costumes... their voices. Everything about this is spectacular.

I was so entranced watching this the first time
i like how chloe exhibits older sister energy and halle exhibits younger sister energy. i don't know how to explain it better but it's happening
forever! Love this@
Chloe X Halle literally made my 2020. They should have swept up all the awards.
Great music!!
Ok, can't stop

Beautiful sirens... ✨

I’m sorry but CHLOE KILLEDDDD THAT BREAKDOWN PART YES MAAMMM
I just wanna know why the little mermaid movie never got talked again
I watch this, like, at LEAST once a week. FIERCE. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I AM OBSESSED
I swear girl groups/girl duos are the most underrated acts in the music industry
Their voices are beautiful omg
This performance is legendary fucking level!!Beautiful Chloe x Halle
22세기형 가수네
Stunning ❤️
I can't keep my eyes off of chloe. She's definitely a vibe
iconnnicc
CAN WE TAKE A MOMENT TO APPRECIATE CHLOE'S ENERGY?? I AM GOING TO COLLAPSE!
Which one is Chloe and which one is Halle?
They sabotaged their performance by putting those distracting drums in the background but the girls still killed it. I would call this performance historical
ulysse face aux cyrenes....comment a t il fait pour resister  ????
the number of times I play this in just one day, every single day 😆
Whenever i hear Chloe say "VMAS." It sounds like "Be amazed!" lol
Now I want locks
I really appreciate this homage to Michael Jackson's "Rock With You" music video. A modern update that's gorgeously done.
I watch this as part of my daily ritual
I don't like the recorded version at all, but the live performance is immaculate 🛐💓
What is their army called? I think I’m a fan now
https://youtu.be/kIbjHtE4fd8
These girls are fuckin amazing
don't mind me just here for my daily listen.
i am so in love hWLP PLEASE

Vma's welcome to the ungodly hour
Duas deusas que merecem todo o sucesso do mundo ai ❤️
I totally see Beyonce's inspiration for this video, didn't like the song at first but quickly became a fave
It's been fascinating watching them go from two little girls doing covers almost a decade ago to this
So many Korean comments what's happening?
Halle sounds like a Disney Princess ! 😍‼️ a Black Snow White 🦋
How is the live version better!?!
this sh!t is soooo good
I watched it so many times , now I know everything they are going to say and do.
honestly this could be the music video for the song
it should be crime that this wasn’t a part of the main performances
Halle's little camera glances are heart stopping !🥺❤️
who the hell is giving this a thumbs down
2:23-2:32 ¿I´m I the only one hearing the little mermaid voice? This girls are something else and I´m 100% sure  they´ll be the F best in this industry.
the fact that im entertained by them, and ONLY them, shows their stage presences in ALL of their performances
언제 이렇게 컸냐고 ㅠ ㅠ 랜선 딸랑구
I watch this everyday and that’s it
OMG these young QUEENS have grown to become BREATHTAKING Performers!! My heart just melted! 😍❤❤👑
PERFEITO
They're thee most hard working duo of 2020. Their body of work needs recognition
인어공주 목소리랑 잘 어울리긴 하다
finally figured what Chloe's other musical iconic image is a mixture of...Mary J. Blige!!! Wow!
Eargasm!
what why THEIR LIVE VERSIONS ALWAYS SOUND BETTER THAN THE STUDIO VERSION WHUT THE HELL
When r they going on tour!!?!?!? :(
Since I heard the song for the first time I've never stopped listening to it. Simply amazing
I watch this at least twice a day.
I appreciate their voices. This is not a good look for them.
This video and the music is so expensive I feel like I need to pay for subscription to watch this.
The lil mermaid live  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOraZx_FRLc
This live version is even better than the recorded one
I just want parenting tips from their mama! AMAZING #BlackGirlMagic
Caralho! Que foda!
They really finna take over
I love it. Period...
If you don’t like them or think they can sing your just simply a hater a they are great just wonderful amazing 😍

YASSS EUNHA X CHLOE X HALLE!! her taste is so immaculate!!
Me encanta esta presentación 😍😍😍😍😍😍👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Loveeeeeeee
This sounds better than the song on the album RELEASE this!
Im dreading the day they decide they both wanna do their own thing🥺 LOVE THIS DUO, but ima still support them if they ever break up
I'm hipnotized
Im obsessed with this live. Gahh so they're too beautiful
I LOVE THESE GIRLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
they're literally at the beginning of their career and delivering like this. Incredible
Okay but the tinfoil outfits are *epic* Love it
Ariana Grande has been real quiet-
Forever gagging
Y’all have the WRONG MANAGEMENT 🤦🏽‍♀️ I Love You both been watching since YouTube Covers 😂💞 Halle’s Voice is UNMATCHABLE & Chloe Has an UNMATCHED presence 🤷🏽‍♀️ BloodSisters🥰🥰🥰🥰Y’all make a Great Team💪🏽💞💪🏽
best vocalists i think
238-246😍😍😍
Dammit I love both of them
this TRULY lives rent-free in my mind
That's is what Hollyhood does, it takes humble genuine talent and makes everything innocent into sex objects
This performance lives rent free in my mind
Gurllll!!!!
CANNOT. STOP.WATCHING. THIS.
WtF nunca escuche voces tan geniales que puuuuu, uff paz mental escucharlas
LOVE THIS SHITTTTT
they're so small but they have such beautiful and powerful voices!!
this SONG wow 🔥
they said you gonna see these HIPS! come on now ladies yessssss!
Chloe always do too much like halle be chillin and Chloe is  literally Beyoncé on stage lmao
This brought me to tears just because I felt this so deep, when I discovered them years ago I found my love for music again, recently after a bad breakup I just felt so empty and lost my love for any and everything, but this, this just brought it back. Like the memories the joy I have when I make music it all came back. Thank you guys, like please never stop what y’all are doing!💕💕
Chloe의 vma 듣고 이 노래에 중독되버렸다 🤤
Greatest song of 2020
Oraginc. Purely blessings. Future of music
This is my video version of this song!!
This is my favorite
I love this more than the official release
This beautiful😇🌍🌎🌏
This is my favorite VMAs performance. They’re so talented and beautiful. Love me some Chloe x Halle💖
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Am I the only one who can hear Ariel singing as Halle is singing? Can't wait to hear those vocals in the film songs✨
I want them to do a song with Usher. That would be fire
👺👺👺👺👺👺👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹💩💩💩💩🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢💩💩💩🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
the amount of times ive come back to rewatch this cannot be healthy...
That's 100%, raw talented Black Girl Magic at work! These sisters are absolutely amazing! Such angelic and powerful voices!
I like it when she says holler at me
I love it so much ❤️
The way these girls go off!!!! Put me in the grave, I live for them!!
Já perdi as contas de quantas vezes assisti essa performance perfeitaaaaa
*I swear these live performances have probably been the only thing good about 2020!*
Would you agree that THIS... is an EMMY Award winning performance?  I say YAAAAAAAASSSSSS!
These two great performance.
I watch this at least 10 times a day
HOW DOES THE LIVE SOUND BETTER ??!
Cómo me tatúo un video?
Daaamn that gave me goosebumps
The live version is way better. 👀💕💕
I need to see them in concert. IMMEDIATELY.
This song is so BEAUTIFUL😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏽🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤💪🏽
2:22 — Ariel  that is all
i’m back again lol. this song and performance is SO CAPTIVATING
OMG,GOD BLESSED, THIS IS SO MAGIC ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
This performance is perfect. That’s it.
Is it crazy that I like this better than the recording ??😂 recording bomb already
The fact that Chloe choreographed all of this a few hours before is really taking me out bc THE TALENT. They are really the whole package!
I’m just here to say I’m obsessed with Halle’s Adlibs at the end of this performance
These women are on a whole different level
Chloe Falsetto has no chill!
I like seeing respected black women, where society allowed them to grow into the great artist they are right now and will only get better. They are expressing their creativity in the healthiest manner possible, making money and being memorable for life, for all the right reasons.
Eu não consigo parar de ouvir essa música pqp ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
this performance lives in my head rent free
Game Over!🔥
I come back here often, this whole performance is mesmerizing 🥺
I love Chloe and Halle like I  personally know them. 💜
This song needs some grammys.. such a refreshing song for 2020
i literally could not be more obsessed
I’m crying. We don’t deserve this!!!
COME ON PONYTAIL!!!
WHEWWWW
the times I have watched this is insane.
I hope they bless us this year with a music video for busy boy
Ese talento que se cargan diossss, que lindo en vivir en un mundo así
My honey loves here is amazing
Chloe is turning into Beyoncé in so many ways .😁
They might be real life angels. Their vocals are unreal.
Speechless 😶 💕
I. Need. This. Re. Leased.
Only shit... their live presentations sounds even better than the studio versions. How that's possible? Also Halle is literally princess Ariel.
Pure perfection!
Damn, these girls got the vibe I need right now
I be sitting this at work 😩‼️
i will never get over Chloe's adlib on 2:44... like holy shiet literally angel's voice
I NEED THIS VERSION ON SPOTIFY    PLEAAAAAASE
너무 좋아....
Can’t hate on this especially with the lack of good music being put out today.
Les Twins with Halle and Chloe...hmm🤔👌🏾
This performance recording should be available on spotify or apple music
I HATE the official audio for this but I LOVE this performance
They are gorgeous and have incredible voices they would be worth going to see in concert  especially when they sound this amazing live.
One of the few musical acts that are better live
I would love chloe x halle and Thriii do a song together!!!! That would be dope right?!🔥
Chloe is clearly talented but Halle just has that natural star quality that can't be taught, you're just naturally drawn to her. She's gonna be a superstar.
I so want them to make a song with Jazmine Sullivan .... those three tones.... MAMA YA GAWD
can't stop watching
I just know YouTube is tired of me constantly rewinding this video back
Wheres normani now ?
I cant stop listening to this music
I need this version on all steaming platforms. ASAP
For some reason their live performance is.always better
The talent !!
I agree totally!!! Chloe’s intensity and Halle’s calmness, they do balance each other out. Both girls are sooooo amazing and talented!!! I don’t blame Beyance for signing them. She is also a mentor and friend to these girls ( thank you B) so we can enjoy their music and get to fall in love with 😍 these gorgeous sisters.   I was listening to them when they were doing their YouTube vids and showing the world how talented they are before fame, and I’ve noticed that as Halle has grown and practiced over the years her voice is here. She found her voice and I LOVE 💕 IT!!!! Her voice is unique I love 💗 her high notes, her voice over all is perfection to me..... Chloe’s voice I’ve heard before, but Halle’s voice is special ( not to put down Chloe, she is very very talented don’t get me wrong no hate here at all) I do have my fav though. But love 💖 them both. Can’t wait for more of their music to come out, they are added to the music I listen to. Thank you girls for blessing this world with your very special gifts!!! We all love you both 🌺💕💖🙏❤️🌹😊🔥
They weren’t in the show?
Their parents really cared for them - blessed they are !
only a matter of time before they start kickin out satanic shit - not surprised.
i'm just now noticing that chloe's braid goes down to the floor!!
O.O BOYS LIKE THIS XD
I hereby declare this song as the theme song for the gays and trans women who have to deal with insecure undercover trade... ✍🏾😂
I can't stop replaying. HELP!
I like their outfits
I love this song
I’ve watched this so many times over the past month and I’m upset it doesn’t have Billie Ellis type views.
BIHHHHHH DAMN NEAR THREW MY SHOES AT THIS MACBOOK  (inserts gif of Trina Braxton screaming at the dinner table)
I like the singing😁😀so cool
me with your eyes I ain't ever seen that kinda view You walking over here The way that it went down, that's when I knew We be talking all night But I can tell you need to work on you, you, you Like you, you, you, like you Like you You be playing sweet But baby don't you know that talk is cheap You can't fool me I wish that you could back it up for me, me, me Like me, me, me, like me  You know that I've, I heard it all before You're hesitant, wish you could give me more I know you like to play the silly games When you're done, call my name  When you decide you like yourself (Holla at me) When you decide you need someone (Call up on me) When you don't have to think about it Love me at the ungodly hour  When you decide you like yourself (Holla at me) When you decide you need someone (Call up on me) When you don't have to think about it Love me at the ungodly hour  I don't have the time To teach you how to love all over again Now let me ask you this Are you giving all that you could give?

They are serving us with that “Feel good Music” They are Two beautiful young ladies who have a bright future.. I can’t wait to see wats next for them!🙂🙂😍😍
Chloe x Halle: Theee Quarantine Queens of 2020
I have this on repeat
This is so beautiful 🦋🦋
This is basically a whole music video! 🤩😍
THOSE VOCALS!!! 😳🤯💀
I literally listen to this version everyday
In the beginning I thought she was saying "be amazed" and amazed I was 😌
Their vocals make me do the Lin Manuel Miranda they're enchanting
2:24
Everything after 2:31 is why i can never go back to only go back to listening to the album version of this song. I-.....speechless
I’m getting “Sweet Dreams” video by Beyoncé vibes✨gosh I love you guys💜
im back here again
Ok that was amazing...new fan here. True artists right here!
My favorite part is 2:24 to 2:47. I just love how Halle sings at that part and then Chloe comes on with that beat love it.
This is incredible
Queens of harmony!
waoo🙌🙌🙌
i watched this video at least 6 times everyday and i'm still not tired
we don't deserve them. 😭😭😭😭
Eargasm! I love it so much
I watch this video religiously
Why isn’t this performance version available on Apple Music
I would invest my lifelong savings on them
Honestly Halle is so gracefull how she dances shes really feeling the vibe Chloes looks abit more rough
They were born with Instagram filters already incorporated into their bodies and nobody can convince me otherwise
Beyonce hand is on over them.....its like listening to beyonce.....🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩👍🏾
TRUE BEAUTY I ADORE THEM
This is Beyonce and Solange if they ever became a duo. They scream the Knowles sisters. HANDS DOWN, my favorite duo of all-time.
I love this version of the song the most
this is literally perfect, like what more do you want
When the performance is better than the studio version :
Maravilhosas! Such beautiful song! ❤️🇧🇷
istg this is so good. i think ive watched this 1000 times this past month
Wow you can tell Beyonce signed them. Such beautiful talented girls
Thank you for bringing back r&b to 2020 so glamorously
You know when ppl say the camera loves someone? This is it
I've been watching the tv series Hannibal and this song really captures the theme or the atmosphere between Will and Hannibal
amém.
I haven't found anyone else that can manage to outperform their own studio version songs. It's like they cover their own songs and their own cover is somehow better. Queens.
Chloe x Halle = Sasha Fierce
Chloe is a little Beyoncé in the making. You can see Queen B’s influences in her vocal style, how she hits each mark during the choreography, that Beyoncé walk down the stage. Just yassss. And Halle??? Whew that girl can SANG and her high notes are FLAWLESS. Beyoncé saw amazing talent in these young women and is grooming them for great things!!! Can’t wait to see what they put out next!!
GREATNESS! I LOVE IT!!
They're both equally attention-grabbing! I'm looking back and forth between them the whole time. That's so rare with music duos or even trios
Halle is going to make a very fine Ariel...I cant wait to see what she does with that character.    She looks and voice is perfect angelic is the least to describe her.
Who else is still here for ChloexHalle live performance...swear they give everything life! 🔥🔥🔥💨 ...
I can listen to this forever
Their voices are magic 😍
straight facts chloe serves life her notes and pitches bro i cant
Who else has been playing this everyday since day 1?
They should put this version on Spotify ♡
목소리가 진짜.. 너무 이뻐ㅠ
Just...wow
when halle sang "love me" the ariel just came out istg
Lol
lighting effects queens
Love that Disclosure was in on making this beautiful song 🖤
DAMN🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
ok first “Tódæ Shöw” now “Víémēš”😭😭
how am i supposed to be straight when women like them exist
They literally look like goddesses, like they could be powerful final fantasy summons. I love them so much.
I need this version on Spotify!!! You were amazing girls!!! Can't stop listening
Wow, this is so good! I'm a new fan
Vocês são deusas que vieram abençoar a terra?
They’re definitely sirens! I can’t stop listening to this performance!
진짜 물고기같이생겼네 이게 인어공주냐 망둥어지
Halle has the mermaid shit DOWN cause, I love Chloe and she stays on her perfomance bag, but I could not look away from Halle. She's hypnotizing here.
These ladies' next project should be a dance/edm album. They'd totally kill it!
I love 💙💙💙💙🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
yesss omg yes thank you
Just imagine a collab with ariana grande my god
They hit different and that's that especially at they age
This is so artistically elevated and so musically rich I WEEP EVERY TIME I WATCH IT AGAIN.
Queen of the night vibes
i watching this like one time per day every morning
I can't stop watching this
I hate that the music industry is sexualizing these beautiful sisters instead of just focusing on their awesome talent. The music industry is wicked.
i hope everyone is voting form them in the people's choice award(category best group, which they are.)
Super talented flawless
Sick as the industry is, i for sorry for these little girl
I guess this the music video for this song period
Their harmonizing skill remain unmatched 🙌🏾
vivo nesta música, cada detalhe é tão bom, tudo nela parece tão perfeito, se pudesse ouviria todo dia.
Such a mesmerizing performance I temporarily forgot we were in a pandemic and that I was at Walmart.
this lives in my head rent free
❤️2:32
2:33 is so hauntingly beautiful. I have commented on here like 100 times. I have a different favourate part everytime i listen.
So gooooood
These two are sooooo Talented... Glad we were requested to react to Halle and Chloe. Super impressed
Me gustó más la rola en vivo
this video give me epilepsy, but I like it
This on .75 playback speed...elite♥️
I'm addicted to this hit 🤯
I love them so much.
The part when they sing “you don’t ever think it about “ 💗
its the serve of the year
bravo les filles
I felt an intense pain in my scalp after watching this performance
ask me if i’ve learned the choreo? yes yes i have. i come back to hear the vocals and do the choreo. i’m so proud of them.
I've been listening to this masterpiece for weeks, thank you Chloe and Halle, you transport me to another place with your music
The sounds so hauntingly beautiful. Ughhh their voices are so beautiful
Beyoncé knows what’s she’s doing. What yall are seeing is new generation Beyoncé and Aaliyah in the making
manero games
Chloe was skanking like a bad bitch, what!?
Godless!
This version is so magical.
Avatars 🌑🌹👸🏽

Vmaaaaasszzzzsssd huhuhu
I’ve lost count how many times I’ve come back to watch this epic performance.
How was this edited out?!!! Fantastic as always
Chloe @ 1:24 tho 😍😩🙌🏼
The Lord created the body to be seen, There IS no shame. Just B Clean, You TWO ARE GENIUSES. Such a niche.❤💋
Performing and singing like Angels IS TRULY A FEAT! Great Job Lady ❤'s.
Estaba antes molesta con Disney con el tema de la sirenita pero apartir de hoy espero con ansias esa película y que salga ella canta hermoso es como si fuera una sirena ( le salen los tonos)
They can’t sing
How I get my hip to do that?
0:19 ♥️♥️♥️
These two embody such a beautiful combo of elegance and power at the same time. I'm obsessed.
I don't know when I'm going to get tired of listening to this song and watching this video...................... I think NEVER!
This was amazing 😍
A new Beyonce & Solange version♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
They give me hologram vibes.
0:02 the intro gives me sweetener world tour vibes ("[name of the city ariana is performing].... welcome to the sweetener world tour")
I AM OBSESSED WITH THEM ❤️❤️🔥
SO WE ISN'T GONN TALK ABOUT HALLE'S SIDE GLANCES????!!!!!
I love the fierce walk part and Halle’s first “Love me” in the bridge
Finally getting back to real music!
I see they're doing the Metropolis ritual.
MASTERPIECE, QUEENS OF THE WORLD.
I can’t tell y’all how I Stan the crap out of these girls. They are so FREAKING TALENTED!
my favorite performance of theirs. just stunning.
Essa música e essa apresentação tem um nível de qualidade que as pessoas ainda não estão prontas para apreciar.
Literally how can anyone dislike this video
0:03 ela fala vma
Halle is always calm, as ever!! I love them! 💖
Man their shit is sam smith's duet😫so wonderful
Waching on repeat love love love
Chloe is literally my body goals.
their costume designer/stylist deserves more recognition. these girls have never looked bad in their lives.
Almost forgot to watch this today
I almost forgot to watch this today
CAN THEY PLEASE ADD THIS ON SPOTIFY!!! THE LIVE VERSION IS SO MUCH POWERFUL
AMO SU MUSICA
yall showed off with this one
amazing! fabulous! beautiful! fantastic!
It was the “Love me” part that gets me😍😍
1:49 vocal showcase ugh
Anyone remember Beyoncé's gold armor?
Chloe putts more effort
I love Chloe's persona, everything from her intense hip movements and voice. I truly admire her performance.
They gave us this performance for free and we didn’t deserve that
This preference won me over i love them you see the sweet dreams video influence
I don’t want to compare or disrespect any one but Chloe is the the Beyoncé of this group.
So why did they perform before the actual show?! MTV be tripping and playing favoritism for BASIC ass artists.
I cannot hear this song without watching this video 🤩 they're just spoon talented 💕
💜💙🙏 Thank God for y'all so much
game grumps animated
This is like hands down the best song and video of 2020. amazeeeee

CALL CHLOE THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN LIFTEDDDD 🧜🏽‍♀️🧜🏽‍♀️❤️✨
This has been living in my head rent free for a week
"Holler at me"/ "Call up on me" 🙌🏿
I can't stop coming back here, pls help 😩😩😩
I think I broke the replay button
the extra beats are as intriguing and necessary as these two already are .. thank goodness for goodness
I'm not a lawyer, but I'm pretty sure it's an actual crime for not giving these women the attention and respect they deserve.
Ok Beyoncé stomps added to the song! YES!
who else is here after watching a clip from twitter//chloe x halle
This song is so Janet and so them all at the same time, and I’m here for it
Respectons les Mesures Barrières (Se Laver les Mains avec du Savon, Porter le Cache-nez et 1m de Distance) car, KHADDELIK vous dis que le CORONA est toujours présent !!!  ICI  👇🏼  https://youtu.be/BFNbUfS2kCc
theres a reason Beyoncé posts them on her instagram
essa apresentação é pft!
Beyonce turned these innocent young ladies into demonic succubuses. Lord help these girls
Mom: where are all my pots and pans?     Me:
I keep coming back...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this performance lives in my mind rent free
1. this was such a tight and clean performance  2. better than the studio version?? 3. i now really want to see them live more
Love this versión more than the studio one 😍🔥
I wonder how B felt about this performance 🤔😍😍😍
the thicker one has more soul in my eyes you can see the intensity she brings to her music not taking anything away from the other one but the thicker one has that passion.
I'm telling my children this was Mary Mary...
no thanks
These young ladies are SUPERSTARS!!  The way they compliment each other is just crazy.  I believe some of their ad-libs are unplanned and they are so in sync that it sounds right in the pocket.  When I think of black girl magic, I definitely think of them b/c they are just ridiculously amazing!!
Fire not even the word, I love yall musicccccc!💕
They are the perfect lemonade. One gives the punch the other is a whole bunch of sweetness. They refresh each other.
they so perfectly harmonize with and compliment each other. jfc the TALENT
Beyoncé’s twins when they were in her womb:
It’s the eye contact for me
Play this at 2x
I watch this performance every single day. I love it
I can’t wait til Halle starts rapping or atleast rap-sing ... she has a voice for it IMO
@2:32  SOMEONE TELL ME THAT IS NOT YOUNNG BEYONCE SINGING
okay but the "ungodly hour " that don't sound right :(
I remember when they started out. They worked so hard. Made there own music.  Such sweet girls. Idk why women have to look sexy to sell records. Men can be fat, old, ugly, fully dressed and they get music deals easy.
Eu tô a 4 semanas viciada nessa apresentação perfeita demais ✨
I can't wait for Halle to play Ariel her voice is heavenly
They did thisss
I have to sue
Can they drop this version on Spotify already??
She should have said “VMAs, prepare to be amazed” Cos we where 😩
Not me trying to learn this choreography 😩😭😂
Oh damn God damn
Waiting for their npr tiny desk concert 🙏🏻🙏🏻
Wow!!!🤩 Their Voices/Tones are unmatched! Eyes closed All day Repeat!!❤😍🎶🔥🔥🔥
so what I’ve learned is that Chloe is always ready and Halle is always prepared. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 no gimmick, just truth, sound and song. 🌿🌿🌿
They're very talented but watching this saddened me. I remember first seeing them as young teens singing America the beautiful at the super bowl. I immediately recognised that that had  the look, the class and most of all the talent to become stars. Now seeing them a few years later being hyper-sexualized and their barely clothed bodies represent them more than their vocal ability is really a shame. Just this past weekend I showed my 8 and 6 year old daughters a video of them singing the national anthem at the 2017 NFL draft and they were amazing. I could never show them this video.
You guys should cover "the very thought of you."
I probably watch this video every night before I got to sleep 😴  so calm. ❤️❤️
Amo esta canción
Chloe is sickening ( in the best way)
Absolutely beautiful.... angelic voices
Perfect apresentação, girls! Parabéns!!
I have watched this like 10 times 👸🏾👸🏾
You can see the Beyonce mentorship so clearly
Watch all their videos four times.  Watch it first, watching them both.  Watch it the second time, watching only Chloe.  Watch it a third time, watching only Halle.  Watch it again, watching them both.  You get four totally different shows, four different types of energy. Dope.  I fux wit' em.
Simply 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 I can't stop listening to this CUT !!!! I like this version better than the album version .
This performance and song is so good, it deserves all the praise and then some.
Was this a live performance?  Regardless, amazing!
This gives me nostalgic 90s R&B feel good vibes  Ugh I'm in love I'll never be able to listen to the studio version after this one lol
0:03
Sounds like Beyonce
Found this gem last night and haven’t given my ears a rest since then.
아름다워요...
Oh my God this was ethereal im so proud of them, I used to watch their cover videos on YouTube all the time and everytime i see them I get so elated
The chills
When decide to love yourself.. meaning when you decide to have high self esteem.
They can sing me the terms and conditions and I will still be entranced. 💜
Love from Brasil💚💛
this is THAT song. They are THAT artist.
💕💕💕
Love that
So fucking better than cnco
Is it just me or does this sound better then the studio version?
PERFEITAAAAAASSS
it’s hurts me that this still isnt on apple music
I was just staring the entire time caught in a trance.....
Beyonce feat Janet Jackson
Wow😍
✨Two beautiful women and two beautiful talented women✨
Best performance of VMAs together with The Weeknd! Legends
When Chloe says "VMAs" it sounds like she's saying "Be amazed". And yes.
They need a live album
Lol
Why do I hear "Be amazed" rather than "VMAs" in the intro? Ain't complaining tho
Chloe ATE this whole performance
These2 though #brightfutureahead
20th time I watched this
I'm having a Chloe x Halle night❤
I love them ! They did an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING PERFORMANCE !!
I can’t stop watching this💕💕💕
should've been the lead single
robbed ❤️
BILLBOARD HAS PROVED ITSELF TO BE THE SAME RACIST SEXIST ORGANISATION IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
Omg they are INCREDIBLE! ❤️ so so beautiful!
They keep bodying us with these quarantine performances y'all
I feel like they both are awesome and they can be their individual artist if they wanted to because they voice is a very versatile very different I love it
Chloe's body is true goals. 😣
Can these two do a song with H.E.R the world could benefit from that type of soul soothing harmony
Joelma está orgulhosa
PERIOD! PERIODICITY! PERIODIC TABLE!
Everything about this performance is mesmerizing. Soooo, why tf have I never heard about these two before??? 😍😍😍😍😍
I don't know about you guys, but I think Chloe and Halle would be perfect for a revamped version of Twitches.     I'll comment this on each video until it happens!
I have watched this so many damn times. I will say it again... I LOVE THE SISTERS SO MUCH. ANGELIC LYRIC FILLED ALIENS OF BEAUTY. They ATE this performance.  They know where that camera is at EVERY SINGLE ANGLE! Fully engaged! There is nothing like a sibling harmony. Amazing!
Their performances are some of the TOP in the music industry right now. Also whoever is their lighting, costume, and production designer are beasts too!
50k views are mine
the HARMONIES they are goddesses—
Deserves all awardssss
idk why i cannot stop watch it 🤩
Is it just me or do they sound like Beyoncé combined ? Alto and soprano notes together at 1x?????
loeeeeeeeeee
Talented Stunning beauties
Chloe n Halle
ON REPEAT 🔥🔥Problems behind me, now I'm doing my own thing 🎶 https://youtu.be/WSqhVh3T0nQ
😩😩😩😩❤️  WHY ARE WOMEN SO GODDAMN BEAUTIFUL MY LORD
PERFECT!
DIOSAS
No, sorry, this is a videoclip, is really clWAIT WHAAAAT?
They're Beautiful, they're a pair, they're equally and individually talented, they totally Love Each Other for who they are, they're BLACK! Can we just say Blessed!!! And leave it at that 🎤💗💞
The vocals in this performance are insane!!! Can’t believe this is them singing live like wtf who else is gonna beat this honestly.
DIOSASSSS! 🌹🌹🌹
I hate the fact they feel they need to conform to half-  dressed pop tarts. They're both too talented for that.
They both sound so good individually and together. I am hypnotized by their vocals! Thank God for these artists.
Showed this to my brother... and his response was "You Know Solange and Beyonce should actually do something like this"  I'm so dead.. The comparison is annoying, but inevitable... And the talent is unmatched.
That strut !!!
Gooooseeebumps.
A CULTURAL RESET
Brasileiros que virou fã dá like👍🏽♥️
comment if youre watching for the 20th time
Every. Damn. Thing. Kuhrayzeee
I’ve watched this too many times, mesmerizing
the way the video wasnt done and i was already starting the video over
Chloe is build like Beyoncè while Halle is build like Solange
You can see that they're Beyonce's girls.
There's this duality to them I love. Halle's calmness and Chloe's intensity
gostei da roupa dela
They are extraordinary they don't get the hype they deserve because they are on a different level. The mediocrity of today's world ain't ready. They are the future
How are they better live than the studio??? LIKE HOW!!!!
Baby Beys 👸🏾👸🏾❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍
When I say they are HEAVILY SLEPT ON 😪
Consumate professionals ALREADY?!! I love this performance so much, the harmonizing, the choreo...just come out here and put the girls on notice! Yes please!
Ruvtbg
thats ae ariel yessssssssss
Damnnnn Chloe is such a vibe!
main stage?: sadly not outfits?: stunning singing?: beauty choreography?: amazing hotel?: closed for corona

I love how one of them is so soft and elegant and the other one so tough and savage like
this is one of many reasons why I can't wait for them to GET THEIR MF SPOTLIGHT in this boring music age. And I cannot wait for the little mermaid! So in love with them! Wish people could hear how enchanting their voices are! One of a kind!
A whole vibe

This is truly one of the most amazing duets I have ever seen 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
It’s unhealthy how this performance lives in my head, rent free. 😭🙌🏾🔥
A song that speaks for this generation
how they sing together like that? so different yet so in sync. it’s truly amazing.
This sounds better than the album
E foi assim que eu fiquiei uma hora presa em video de três minutos
Very talented. But the videos are very ritualistic..
Please! release this version on spotify
Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful 💚🧚‍♀️
Okay, every live performance is immaculate, but the vocal performance HERE. Have Mercy.
These girls exude talent. Their voices and flow are untouchable.
Beautiful!!!!
They remind me of Zhane
Hot damn! This is fire!!!
Whoever designed those costumes needs an award and a few sexual favors.
holy hell
I watch this twice a day religiously
M E R M A I D S. <3
Tão perfeito esse vídeo 🥰🥰
I’ll take 2:31 for $500k pls.
Chloe's serving dominatrix style and Halle's her shy homegirl with the tools.
best performance of the entire thing. classic and completely new.
Um garoto que eu gosto acabou de mandar esta música pra mim oq isto significa?
chloesofierce.com
The fact they didn’t win any awards with above & beyond talent has again exposed the shady side of the industry. Best talent out of the whole generation!
Im here for the 1000 time to watch
💖💖💖
Absolute perfection
These ladies 😍😍I give up on them
Black women aree just *chef kiss* 😳🥵👏🏾
I can't even remember how many times I've played this, waaaaay too many.

1:40 I can listen to this part forever

I should have stanned sooner
IM OBSESSED WITH THEM OH MY GOD
sooo good🖤🙌🏻
LIKE......... FOOOOORRRR WHAAAAAAAAT-T-T-T????!!!!!!!! WHY DID THEY SLAY IN SUCH A WAY??!!!!
Getting Janet Jackson Vibes Hella <3
This is SO sensual, I am digging it!
Amazing from the netherlands
é realmente tudo que as gays queriam
Im feeling this in all the ways
VMAs: Hey guys, we're ordering food, what do you want to eat? Chole x Halle: Ungodly Hour
this was absolutely the best performance of the whole night
Every performance I can’t help but focus on Halle even tho Chloe has the quintessential stage presence I usually look for. Halle really is that girl! The voice, the face, the effortlessness, it’s all there. Both are freaking QUEEENS tho
Yesssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssd
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES . I love it !!!!!!
Omg the vocals!!!!! 💙💙💙
These girls voices are just amazing.😩
💖💖💖💖
My favourite <3
We believe in  you girls. Just tell the devil he a liar.
ICONIC performance. I love these ladies!!
This is my first time seeing and hearing them. Damn, they're so underrated
i am in love with this music video
Chloe was singing her ass off😫!!!!!
AHHHH ❤❤
love that  aong
I try to come at least twice a week to jam this bop.
Idk if it's the boots or the two-step at 3:01, but I see so much of Mary J. Blige in Chloe.
❤
wow amazing
lendárias 💖
2:03 I LIVE FOR MISS CHLOE STOMPING THROUGH, YES!!!! ♥
Halle's "Love me at the Ungodly what" really just *chefs kiss*
the way they ripped my wig off-
I loved their performance wow
Every time I listen to the album version now I hear the drums that this performance has (2nd verse onwards) Icons
They are so Naturally  beautiful i hope the pressure Holly wood don;t get to them an they Keep their natural hair
The fact that they are still harmonized when  they vocalize on diffrent q’s is crazy✨✨
How can it be ungodly when they're both goddesses!!!
me encantan
TIMELESS.
I like this more than the original version
i listen to this religiously every day and show it to every single ome of my friends
so refreshing to have this kind of music in 2020 instead of you know the usual "rap" shit
The power this song has
It could even be too sophisticated for the charts but it should be a single anyway, because it’s simply very very good.
They have beautiful voices but this is not it
Solange wrote this???
Best VMA performance.  Out of all those performances only handfull trended on Youtube, and this the one that grended without the MTV push.
the way that even their blinking was in sync, POWERFUL
Halle i love your voice 🖤
This is beautiful
Music therapy dont be sleeping on my sisters!!xoxoxo
Stop comparing them to each other or others. They are an amazing duo and both are talented. Enough said.
2:42 , 2:46 THE BEST PART IF YOU DISAGREE YOU'RE WRONG
O comentário brasileiro que você procurava 🇧🇷🇧🇷💕
This performance was just....  Halle rocked with her silent mesmerizing strength and Chloe  with her overpowering seductive strength. They blended so well the whole performance was hypnotic
queens
Ungodly hour? 🧐🤔
OMG ARE THEY EVEN REAL? this is perfeccttttt
AMAZING
Almost forgot to watch this today
These beautiful souls are AMAZINGLY talented! They deserve all blessings coming their way! God bless you two and much continued success 😍😍🥰🥰
I'm I the ONLY one that caught Halle Moaning in the middle of the performance at 2:14 🤣🤣🤣.... She, they both was feeling this damn performance and F it up ‼️
Chile Chloe Do NOT be playing!! #slay
Brasil🇧🇷
I need to hear a twigs collab
This beat is sooo so slamming!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Can’t stop watching. Love this performance ✨💕
The melanin queens deserve it all👸🏽 And I mean ALL! This was one of the best live performances the VMAs even had
That's why Chloe gained a lil weight because she would be Ursula?
I watch this video every morning 🤍🖤
Did I hear literally Ariel voice omg
HEAVEN SENT
Am I the only one to think that this is way much better than the studio version?
Incredibly smooth song with an old school R&B feeling with those voices.  Plenty of upcoming talent on the way! 🔥👌
1:05 I didnt know light could do that !!!!
Chloe killed those moves, amazing
I've watched this video everyday, ATLEAST once a day, for the last two weeks.
Chloe with the stank face at 2:59 Whew!! I felt that shit
Deserved more attention!! The vocals ATTITUDE and visuals are everything!!! No ones doing it like them!
I love this performance! 😍
They are so powerful on every single way.
It is sad that I watched and listen to this so much I know the dance?
They're such good performers!!!! Vocal, performance, and visual wise!!!!! They got everything!!! Amazing !!!! Also I absolutely love how Chloe is Big Font and Halle is tinie font, I can't explain but I love it
minha vida agr é um loping infinito dessa musica
nice
When Halle started to sing love me while she was walking back killed me 😍 and Chloes runs were fire
Halle is so cute I can’t
They are legends in the making. Beyoncé is teaching them well.
They are amazing and so much better than beyonce hands down
Chloe have so much energy and i'm in love with her voice
its just AMAZING 🖤
Perfeitasssss
i prevail
I've been listening to these girls since the album the kids are alright and i'm so happy there starting to get the recognition they deserve. There absolute queens and they have the voices of angels. Love you Chloe and Halle, and i always will.
When Chloe turned around...ok girl, I see you
Whom ever designs and creates your outfits for your performances deserves a raise, your outfits never disappoint as well as your magnificent vocals!
Can’t stop listening to this! So proud of these girls 😊
MEU DEUS ela vai ser PERFEITA como Ariel. Nossa!
I just love the runs in this song. They just go back and forth doing this gorgeous runs that just make the song for me.
They couldve been on Carole and Tuesday
LAS ADORO 😭😍😍❤️
This is giving me sweet dreams video vibes.!
Quase morro quando ela manda o VIEMÊS
overrated
They look so gorgeous in those outfits! It kinda reminds me of some of the looks Bey had at one point.
😍😍😍
estoy enamorado... THIS IS FUCKING PERFECT
💯 🖤💜💙🧡🤍❤🤎💛💚
can they please collab with vanjess
In loooove with the song and the performance! 😍
What if this was all in their living room? *its a joke you numbnuts*
I’m just amazed by how talented and in sync they are. Great artist.
THIS IS ON POINT OMG
pink lady
But why are eyes watering? lmao
i got one question. what were u high off of when u decided to dislike this performance?
Damn I wish the drums were in the studio version
This performance is so amazing it gave me chills even after my 100th time watching it. These woman truly are powerful. #blackgirlmagic
their voices support each other..  I liked it.
I can't wait for halle to be ARIEL. The vocals are everything
Wow....mesmerizing all the way..
Best performance ever idc what nobody fucking say !!!!!
Curti bastante, mas parece q falta mais uma pessoa.
talent
Chloe is amazing (you can see the diva in her💁🏾‍♀️) but Halle though!!! Her voice and composure throughout is amazing!!! I can't imagine a better mermaid! 😭
PATROASSS DEMAISSSSS AMOOOOOOOOOO
I just love how their personalities complement each other so well. Chloe gives me fierce and Halle is more sultry in her movements. I wish them so much success.
Can't stop watching your performances. All so perfect!
hater,s
God this girls are amazing
they are the *MOMENT* ✨ I'm blown away
I’m crying they are so good. Now all they need to do is perform Wonder what she thinks of me and my life will be complete.
i CANNOT be the only person watching this video EVERYDAY since the 30th AUG! TUHHHHH!!!! #ICONIC
Stellar, amazing, the list goes on. This is it!
They ATE these women deserve the main stage
Older sister poppin'  -- literally.  A great performance honestly.
Não consigo parar de ouvir essa música.  *--*
Those voices ❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏
best performance evaaaaah
Chloe is a whole vibe😍
I come back to this performance almost everyday omg
0:56 just look at Halle ... I don’t know why but this makes me feel a joy that nothing else can give me ... I’m so proud of them ❤️
I am here for my daily dose of Ungodly Hour performance. Every time I watch this masterpiece, I imagine myself in a splendid space theatre, the audience have their Hajime Sorayama style floating seats, mesmerizing at the huge virtual figures of our beloved queens Chloe x Halle. Or just like living in those nostalgia Sci-fi illustrations,  Moebius but diamond shining, timeless, ultimate.
this song is gonna age beautifully
Please, why are there one thousand dislikes??!! Do people get paid to do this??!! There shouldn’t even be a single dislike. C’mon y’all! Zero taste.
WOOOW!!!!! 🤯🤯🤯 This is beyond!!!
Great song. I rather listen to it than watch these like children looking girls in half naked mirror garments....this oversexualization is too much for me...when is wearing clothes in trend?!
How is this better than the studio one. HOW
One of them needs to work on her facial expressions. She's forever hard faced when there's no need to be.
Alguém do Brasil aqui?💕
No awards won because other than the performance this song is very forgettable.
This is talent we need. Talent that auto tune didn’t manifest. Artists that sound exactly like the studio version. Raw, raw talent.
woah 😳
Can’t wait til they go bigger than before so I can say I was there since day one
Hi, I'm here everyday. I watch this everyday.
I'm gay and become super gay while listening to this song
Iv watched this video like 50 times I'm obsessed!! I find myself 2tching the video not just listening because the outfits the movements and talent is SO amazing!!!!!!!
Can we just talk about she said VMA's in tune with the song!!!! 😍😍😍
https://youtu.be/l1FW4QSkl7c assistam essa
Really torn with the whole princess ariel thing because I really want an actual red head to play it but halles voice really sounds like a mermaid seducing you.
I loveeeeeeeee
can someone PLEASE give chloe's hips their own stage? goddamn! they are solely responsible for those beats.
Pure heaven. Oh my..
My Gawd!!!!😝😝😝
You guys should hv 20 million views 🤩🤩🤩🤩
❣️❣️❣️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❣️❣️
I don’t need a music video, this is music video quality to me those lights hitting the body amor 👌🏼
Halle is so beautiful damn🤦‍♀️
IM OBSESSED WITH THESE 2 FFS
Best performance of all this year.
Two of Hercules muses? YES PLEASE
Real-life harpie lady sisters
Amoooooooo
amazing!!!!!!!!
Damn
Simply quintessential.
Beyonce is written all over this performance. From the dance moves to the outfits. It is great to see that Bey is hands on with their careers. Some records companies sign artists and leave them to figure it out for themselves.
I was already in love with the whole aesthetic, and then 1:05-2:00 straight up murdered me. <3
Why does this sound better than the studio version?
I personally think they sound terrible together but it might just be because it’s a new style. It’s weird.
This Chromatica ambassadors really turned it huh
you're both so talented and gorgeous and amazing 🥺💕💕💕💗💖
I have seen this video just today like 50 times, and I'm not stopping
Eu não conhecia  Agora , sou fan  LOVE love love
Is it too far fetched to think these two are actually sirens??? 🤔😭💞
Wow
Imagine been that good and not being on the main stage.
yo put the video in 1.25x u would not be disappointed💙 *insert vouge movies here*
Imagine being this gorgeous and talented
The sista on the right is killing it✊🏿💯👍🏾
Pretty
#majorlove  ❤️❤️
This is the most mesmerizing thing I've seen all 2020
THE 90S VIBES
the runs from 2:30 onwards 💗___💗 they’re insanely talented i’m literally in heaven
Shout out to who ever does their set,lighting,and outfit designs for all of their videos like this,because it is always perfect.
I love how much their sound has changed and yet they stay true to their original sound as well.
they sound and look so good!!!!!!!!!!!!
They are so very talented but they need a look. They don't stand out so they'll never stand out
Thanks for brings these amazing artists, beyonce!!!  The new generation is showing very good acts.
I'm still tryna find my edges 💯💯💯
godly vocals.. damn
They are our future generation and that’s on what
Amo vocês.  Amo a musica de vocês.  Vocês sao maravilhosas.
wow so talented👏😍🙌✨💖👌
They should just make this the official video for the song tbh
Comments all about Halle. Give love to my baby Chloe
This is the most mesmerizing video....I simply love it.
Its like witnessing 2 angels..seriously
Amazing 👏
Chloe is giving Beyoncé energy with her dances , energy, voice, everything. My singing queen is back and it showed up in Chloe. These girls are saving the music industry one body roll at a time
Oh          My          God
Sickening. I don't even deserve to be listening to this.
ugh please release this version i'm obsessed
Is it just me or any one of you also do the same thing when Chloe say ' VMAs...' and then you continue the phrase '....Looking for the Queen ' ( From FeFe -Tekashi 69 ft Nicki Minaj). 😂
This is pure art! Woowww
Girl the strut
Their talent is immaculate!!
I LOVE THEM! I can listen to them sing alll day. Such beautiful voices
Chloe is working it hard for the camera.
This is what happens when you don't put talent in the main show they show up the main show acts.
halle is an ethereal beauty...
Chloe love ya baby but ya did too much
I haven't seen performance creativity in a long time since TLC. Yall give me those same vibes that I thought I would never feel again🙌😍
I absolutely love all of this! ;)
Play at x1.25 for a lil razzle dazzle ✨
when Chloe and Halle go down to the tennis court you know it’s about to OVER
Very well done Beyoncé, you have created Two Monsters of music, these girls are going to go a long way because they are the most talented I have seen so far.
My mom : where the hell is all the foil !!?? Me and my sister :
This version sounds better than original
Their voices are the perfect match
THIS MAKES ME FEEL SO CLEANSED AND MAKES ME FEEL LIKE IM IN HEAVEN.
i cant believe Halle is 19*.... both of them have so much talent
Girls I’m gonna need y’all to release this on Spotify ASAP please. Thanks.
😂😂

This makes me wanna look forward for the upcoming The Little Mermaid.
I can say for certain that I have contributed at least 100 views alone this week. This performance will never grow old.
The vocals!!! 🔥🔥🔥
i watched this performance on every platform every time i see it.... it’s that damn good ‼️ I love y’all 💜
i like how chloe exhibits older sister energy and halle exhibits younger sister energy. i don't know how to explain it better but it's happening
We just can say this is the music video cause I’m have this on repeat
😍😍 Amazing voices
Their energies complement each other so beautifully. Same with their voices. They really have something special here.
I can't believe this is the best performance from the VMA's  It's so hypnotic I keep coming back every other day.
Chloe reminds me of Beyonce the way she moves and dances 🙈
The artistry 😩❤️
🤍🤍💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎
It’s everything for me,the looks,the movement etc.💞🔥🔥

❤️❤️❤️❤️😭🙏
okay but how are they singing this live. from the choreo to the effortless harmonies; they’re on a whole new level!!
Meu, vcs são perfeitas!!!

their stage presence is out of this world LIKE?!
Elas !
Celebrity obsessed fans
Celebrity obsessed fans
PERFEITAS CARALHO
Otro gran performance de los Vmas 😦😦😦😦♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Can we get the bailey sisters to verzuz with the McLain sisters ... 😬 can that be a thing
THEYRE SOOOOO GOOODDDDD
Amazing like so underrated
2:23 god i love halle’s voice so much.
0:10 loove this part. the hip popping was iconic
2:23 to the end is what you hear at the gates of heaven
We need the live album because y’all eating the album versions like a light weight snack!!!! Effortless performances back to back 🙌🏾
I love how the album versions and their live versions are always different! It’s like experiencing a new song each time🥰🥰
Hozier put this song up on his story and was like “ how did I not know about this before”
the vocals?????
i wish i was built like chloe
💭 This Performance made me like the song more... 😎  (Chloe & Halle have lovely voices, and they've kicked it up a notch with the choreo!...)🎵💃🏼👍🏼
2:46 lady gaga possessed her for a moment
The way this performance is so good that I thought it was lipped 😭
They are so beautiful! ❤️
The chorus has this strangely addicting, circa 1930's Disney animated musical arrangement to it.
i’m still mad they weren’t put on the main show cause this performance was just pure EXCELLENCE.
The amount of times I watch this in a day .
i need myself an energetic black woman dats bad & boujee and jiggy
It's like they are putting you under a spell 😍 you can't help but be captivated 💯
I’ve played this video so many times I can’t even keep count anymore 😻
I'm obsessed with this song, its soooooo good.
Does anyone one else feel like Chloe just trys too hard compared to Halle? I just can't unsee it after noticing.
the way I can't listen to the original audio without singing the ad-libs/note changes from this performance now
Their performance reminds me of Nona Hendricks and MJ.
mesmerizing
i keep coming back... they are on Goddess Level!
I have said this many times and I’ll probably continue to say it: SHEESH.
Maravilhosas ❤
Jeeeeeeeeezzzzzz....just snatch all my edges why don't u suh 🌊🌊🌊🌊🎶🎶🎶🌊🌊🌊🎶🎶
https://youtu.be/l1FW4QSkl7c olhem essa
aweosme job ladies vocals on point  great music
This performance is EVERYTHING!!!
i cannot stop listening to this song
Amazing!!!! Best duet all the times
The skills of the Baileys Sisters...on Par with the Williams and the Lijadus.  Black Women!
The strut at 2:05 - ICONIC
Halle should get a bigger singing role
That shit slaps!
Um why was this not a main performance!!! MTV I'm so disappointed in you. ChloeXHalle had the best performance in my opinion. These two are a powerhouse!!❤❤❤
Is it just me or does it feel sort of bad and sad that the big corporation machine turned them into unrelatable robots on stage? I liked them more when they felt like normal humans and not some pop idol style art piece.
Chloe is a PERFORMER! and Halle is getting so good and confident too - love to see it!
Buffff, i like this retro style. Can stop ear it and moving. Gracias desde Canary Islands.
<3

1 week later & I'm back here , I think I'm obsessed .😭❤️
essa musica nem é a minha preferida do album, mas a performance ja me fez voltar varias vezes!!
2:22 That's Ariel right there, if you disagree you're wrong
these girls do nothing less than full PRODUCTION
Also that hip thrust in the beginning is 😍
Wow! This version is better than the original! So much better! 😍
Yassssss Queens!
I’m here again 😭😭😭😭😭
las 2 cantan de lujo, pero en la puesta de escena, el trasmitir y en el baile chloe se come a halle
Their outfits are so mesmerizing. And it really goes well with the song! What could you expect more from that?
THE WAY SHE SAYS “VMAS” IN THE BEGINNING IS SO SATISFYING
Hallie  and  k ylie
Perfeitas😍😍😍
They definitely need to release THIS version of the song
PERFECTION
Serious Brandy vibes.
Iconic sisters.... and it's only the beginning....
Their vocalizations sound like two beautiful angelic ghosts 👻🎙
*OBSESSED*
they really deserve to be a massive success, so talented
The one who conceptualize this performance also deserve recognition. It kinda took me back decades ago.
VMAssss.. Welcome to the Ungodly hour... :P
VMA version of this >>>>>>>
Uhm, so is there anyway we can convince you to make the live versions available on  streaming platforms? Please? You can take my money if that's what you want,
Their moves are crazy, also. Why is nobody talking about them ? 😍 Come through, sisters 😍😍
I have seen this unhealthy number of times😍.
Queenies!! I’m here for every single bit of this!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
#recastlittlemermaid
Can definitely see the tinges of inspiration and perhaps influences from Beyoncé but they still have their own music and fashion style which I loveeeee
2:22 - LOVE ME TIME STAMP
Omg
I came when she sang that “love me love me love me love meeeeee” love ME fuck
magical shit 🤍. my new favorite song off the album
At this point the album is just a teaser for the live . 😫
I like how they accidentally made a MV form a live performance.
yall getting beyonce vibes too??
A M A Z I N G !  !  ! No other word could describe their performance, it was the best of the evening. AMAZING!
Maravilhosas 🇧🇷❤️
i Love this but idk why i feel Like they should be individual singers to just see how they would do ... just a.suggestion but since they are sisters i understand that they have a strong pact but i notice that they both have singing accents Like the other is Like retro and other more of pop but anyway its just an opinion❤️❤️❤️
❤❤❤❤❤
💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
I need this version in my playlist!

(Love me at the ungodly hour)
They served so fucking much, OMFG
This one those songs that you have to sing to 🤣
WOW
These girls are from a different planet!! I prefer to listen to the live performance over studio!!!
Can we please get this live version on the deluxe album or released on Spotify please? I think I’ve listened this version way more then the album. It’s FUCKING AMAZING!!
ladies I LOVE y'all!!! So much talent it makes me emotional! I know I'm a nobody but I just want to say, please dont let the industry pressure you all to be hypersexual or to be anything that you feel uncomfortable being. Much love from a big fan! ❤❤❤❤❤
You can tell that they are Beyoncé’s artists. Kinda sound like her to
You can tell they learn from the Queen😭😭😭😭 so perfect
This is better than the studio version
CHIQUE DEMAIS
best dressed!!!
I think i died @2:04
Perfeição meu Jesus 😍🇧🇷
i watch this video everyday just for a boost of serotonin.
Best performance on VMA
You both have heavenly voices and should have won in every category you were nominated for 🙌🏽 I absolutely love your album and listen to it all the time! 🖤 👑 👑 🖤
This song makes me so happy The visuals are crazily on point strong soft on point everything
Chloe x Halle are just Goddesses in their own right, absolutely Devine 💯. In my opinion... They were the show ❤️❤️😍 and its pathetic that black prowess and excellence is still frowned upon in this time and era. They slayed though 😏🙈💦❤️
I think te song doesn't fit them, they r like 20 and 22 what do they know. It's too sexy and deep for their age. How u heard all before???? I mean 🙄🙄🙄
the music industry dnt deserve these girls, sis are above everyone else in that boring , useasoned music industry. BLACK EXCELLENCE AT ITS FINEST
2:01-2:09 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼  The whole performance was bomb tho💣🔥
vim pelo Xavier
Both Women Are Incredible Singers & Vocalists.. But HALLE HAS THE VOICE OF AN AAANGEL.. I Peep How Chloe Was Doing The "Halle" Vocals, Too Plus Her Own.. I Was Trying To Concentrate More On Halle, But CHLOE'S PRESENCE Is Just.. Wow! It Captures You.. & It Does Overshadow Halle's A Bit.. I Can't Wait For Halle To Bloom Into Her Own Confidence As Well.. Overall, This Was A DOPE ASS PERFORRRRMAAAANCE.. I Love These Gals.. "MY FUTURE DAUGHTERS" I'm So In Love
Get rid of one of them... let's choose here.
Produits de Beyoncé 🥰😋
From listening to the album, who else thought Chloe sang both verses? I absolutely love how they both can do anything with their vocals. Werk y'all.
MELODY so good I smacked my reflection
Can we talk about the oufits ? I LOVE them.
*Why is this not on spotify?*
I wonder if they did this on the “Ha-Loe Tennis 🎾 Court”
I think about this pretty much daily lmao
Wonderful! I can't stop listening to them!!!
The amount of times I watch this is out of this world
Anointed
I can’t stop watching this, it’s the definition of perfection 👏🏻
Exactly what time is the "Ungodly hour"?
This sound better than Album version
I like this song 😏😏😏✍🏻✍🏻✍🏻🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝💋💋💋
2:39 I’m gonna cry, THEY DID THAT!!!
I'm so happy to see how far they've come since they were kids. I was a kid too, and it just makes the child in me so excited. They both give two flavors to a song and performance. One is a poised elegance that has the quieter and controlled power of a legend that demands respect and calls attention... While the other has a legendary, more upfront, outward power that demands you also pay attention and hear what their heart's trying to say.  It's a beautiful harmony that I feel could be called a 'yin and yang' quality. So awesome!  They're both so refreshing and they already have the future set for eventual legendary status.   They both have so much to say in a song, different perspectives, it's so rare and beautiful to see two people this talented working together, even as siblings. They're both different and neither is beneath the other, they each add something, and they are unbelievably powerful.   Sending so much love to them, and celebration.  (This was uploaded on my birthdayyy tooo, so giddy about them!)
quanto talento 🥰
This was definitely recorded live. It may have been edited/filtered for tv but it was definitely recorded live.
I seriously cant stop watching this video! Everything about it is perfect 😍😍😍😍
I'm tired of y'all comparing them. First of all, they're different people. With different styles. Stop saying Chloe is "forcing" herself. She has as much vocal control as her sister. Second, they have different body shapes. They can do the same moves all day and they'll still look different. Just sit and appreciate their vocals and talents as a pair without pinning them against each other as individuals.
I really like this song they are very talented and I hope for them to perform more
I feel like they took me back to 1999 but it's also the 60s ad the future all at once
They sound like honey 🍯
i can't stop thinking about how good this is aaaaaaaaaaa my brother asked me if i'm okay bc i had this on repeat for like the 10th time already
I love
THIS. IS. IT 👏🏼
Marvelous!!!! I bought the album a while back.
THIS IS MY SONG!
This song makes me wanna go to the club, that’s saying a lot 💀 especially when those thump thumps come in. Ugh. Yes.
I hear girls like you rhythm
PURE TALENT & INSPIRATION 😭😭😭
this crispy asf
Me encanta el ritmo y cómo bailan cuando inicia el video 💙 sé que no leerán este comentario, pero las ame 💙
Halle is so naturally seductive and stunning.
*It's Okay None Win BUT Still Win For You*
Can we please get more marketing from their team because lord!!!!
They are so talented
Im bout to hear this song shopping in the malls 🙌
At 2:44 THEY GIVING US THAT BLACK GIRL MAGIC GLOW 🙌🙌✨✨
The bigger girl is like every girl when "their song" comes on in the club 😂
The world is going to changed these girl simply because they started off Godly now they singing  ungodly smh.
2:30 use this time stamp as a replay button because MISS CHLOE NOT PLAYING W HER RUNS!!!
O que é isso? Uma cobre a outra, uma sintonia impressionante, não via há tempos um dueto tão harmônico e hipnotizante!
The fact that I watch this video once a day lets me know that this SHOULD NOT have been in the preshow. Disrespectful.
I wish they could’ve performed at the actual VMA show in front of the audience 😭🙌🏾😍
so fucking good
I've watched this so many times. They are so amazing. Aesthetically this is wonderful, but their voices are just beautiful and unbelievable. Awesome.
God, are they capable of making a song that isn’t amazing!??
Yow they did that!!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They ate the MF show period!!!!! The red carpet stepped on them preach!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't believe MTV had an award during a CXH concert 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
Yeesssss.This whole visual and song giving Donna Summer love ta love you baby vibes!!!!💓💓💖💖💖💖
how are they even real?!
Seriously! They been in the game for too long, to be doing pre shows!! But yet you have doja cat, whatever that is. Doing main shows!!!!! 🙄🤦🏽‍♀️ these queens deserves more, than what they’re receiving!
Unreal!!
Hat was BEAUTIFUL
Wooooow...
are they even real? lol there's no way, i think i'm watching anime because they are too perfect lol
If MTV Knew Better you two should've been on the Main Stage on not in the Pre-Show
Amazing 😻👌❤️
They both have different styles but very in sync. One has a voice with opera like range, the other has R&B Neo/Soul style. I love it!
Can they cover the Miseducation of LH?
I can't resist their perfection
They need to make a MV for this song.
In love 😍🙌🏻
Now that was smoking🚒
THIS LIVE VERSION BETTER THAN THE ALBUM VERSION. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
OMFG BRUH! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
i litterally cant stop watching this video.
I’ve watched this like 50 times today alone! Mesmerising!!
I really don't have to say anything u all lit up the comment section with facts!....these young ladies are gems..unique..and in there own lane so beautiful!
Beautiful performance...the lights and Sound just match ❤️❤️❤️
loving the contrast between their performance styles, yet how they compliment EACH OTHER so beautifully.
I really wish they would put all there live performances on Spotify like as a separate album or something like bey did with homecoming
This performance didn't have to slap this hard!!
Tbh I didn't like their earlier songs...but this one is just magical!
Chloe is such a performer! I love it and Halle is so chill. Her gaze is so cool
https://youtu.be/OZEFvvrmyTs 🔥🔥🔥
The decided to stay safe rather than be on their main event
the only 2020 vma performance I've watched more then one time
They sounds like birds
I enjoyed this ❤️
Brilliant. 💖💖
Halle is so oddly gorgeous 😍😍💕
*I feel Beyonce vibes...its straight but im not a fan of them...that one needs to blow her nose*
My babies 💛💛💛
2:24 to the end is what sirens sound like before they drag you to the depths of the ocean.
Belly so full 'cause this was the serve
Everytime I see this video, i click! This performance was everythinggggg and the outfits were 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love the differences that come through. Chloe hits every move like pow and Hailey is just like I'm gonna keep it chill.
They definitely changing the game 😭🔥🤍🖤🤍🖤
I don't know but I feel so proud after listening to them😊.
They look like two sexy burritos
God I love these girls so much 💕💕💕
You look cute and your sister look pretty
We are looking at SUPERSTARS ✨‼️
They should keep them away from the other whorish artists too.
the best vma performance by FAR. this could literally be the official music video I LIVE
um...this song is pure HEAT!!!!! 0_o
They sound like mermaids that mesmerize fishermen with their voices.
Omggg how did I just discovered them!!! They're mind blowing 🤯
They did THAT.
Chloe is baby Beyoncé
Had to come back to play this with the subwoofers! WHEW!!!😍
this performance ... the VMAs were unworthy
LISTEN ORANGE GARDEN RENAN MARQVES
IM DEAD
bruh they are so beautiful
They are everything and are serving everything during this time. They deserve so much more and people should start to give them more attention
Serving Missy visuals and Beyonce vocals
Whoever’s styling this act has got it all wrong. Sex is not for them.
3:05 her hips 🤗
This song has constantly been on my mind, mind, mind, mind and on repeat, beat, beat, beat like repeat
DAY 1s WHERE U AT?!
This song live sounds 1000 times better that the actual audio, SO MUCH TALENT😍💕💕💕💕💕
Chloe is insane! She's got some different kind of presence, im mesmerised!
🇭🇹🕺
when she says vmas i be in other planet
No other Artists matters.... thank you for transporting us to the future..so glad I got a chance to see it.
Afrofuturism is the fucking FUTURE
They got them clothes straight out of Beyonce closet lol, but I loved it. I always admired these little women.
Main stage worthy Music Festival worthy Headline worthy Stage tour worthy International tour worthy
the added drums is sooo beyoncé... didnt really add much to the song
Never cease to amaze....
Live album please.
This is so BOMB 💣
Meu deusss ??? Amadaa
My birthday is in 2 hours!!
musicão, perfeitas
💖
I love those girls. What voice! What sweet song to listen! 😍
Maravilhosas😍😍
wow ladies could be any more perfect
P E R F E I T O
Black Girl Magic! Get it girls, this was straight fire. You killed it👍
wtf... am I the only one noticing how thick one of these girls have gotten?
Wow, this is real talent ！ I hope they succeed and that they never change their style.
This should just be released as the music video.
Even more upset that they didn't take any awards home! These girls are amazing and more talented than most
meninas maravilhosas!
Impecáveis!!!!!
I didn't even mean to click on this but I'm glad I did because holy shit they're amazing
Ungodly hour what kind of atheistic theme is that, disgusting.
Giving me beyonce and solange
No joke, I've watched this video at least 50 times. It's too good. This is one of those live performances that are even better than the actual song.
Reminds me of Janet Jackson with destinys child
How can I get this on my iPhone?
Blimey........I mean....seriously, though...what WAS that?! ❤
omg they are so precious!! We must protect them at all cost!! I rebuke any fuckboys and bad influences from these two woman life because they are stars .....period
zerou o vma
Halle is so effortless , chloe isn't so graceful with it.
This was the most interesting thing I’ve seen at the VMAs in a decade. The sound, the visuals. It feels like I’m watching the birth of something big.
Magical
Wait lmao, I just realised this is live. What the fuck this is so good.
they are just too cute lol
90's vibes😍😍😍❤❤
Love those clothes, and the special effects
Favorite song of 2020
Well damn....
This has beyonce written all over it
At first I thought she said "Be amazed..! Welcome to the Ungodly Hour" and tbh I'm going to continue believing that.
Performance concept was cute but their music goes NOWHERE.
Não tenho estruturas pra tanta perfeição
This performance is too powerful
Damn, the Luminati didnt waste any time. Already sexualizing these girls.
Boy, they better be on the main stage next year! Literally the best performance of the evening! Well down ladies and Parkwood Entertainment! 😘
We need this version on Apple Music🥺
Yessss my favorite vma performance
Shame on MTV for not featuring them...
Well that was a slay. I like Do It more though, wish they had performed that one.
chloe is so slept on 😭 her voice is so smooth and her runs are sooo velvet  edit: i said this bc i saw a lot of the other comments were addressing halle. this is not putting them against each other (they’re a sister duo team bro) and this is not saying one is better than the other. i like chloe’s voice and i like her runs, the end :) the replies got so ugly so quick so pls just... don’t 🙃
That is one of the Baddest shhhhhh I seen all year OmG!!!!💞💞✨✨✨✨✨✨✨🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow. They sound amazing. That was a beautiful performance.
I don't know what it is about this performance, but this sealed the deal for me in terms of Halle's effortless talent. Her movements, expressions, endless and alluring eye contact with the cameras, and power in her voice without all of the theatrics. Everything looks so natural when she does it, and God, to be that effortlessly perfect in every performance is a power. She was born for this and she's going to reign supreme. She's going to catapult to such a high level after The Little Mermaid comes out.  I love Chloe so much, she is such a powerhouse vocal already at such a young age. She's working on becoming Beyonce's predecessor vocally. She could truly match Bey. I hope she starts to carve out her own lane though, like Beyonce has the signature growl, I can't wait to see Chloe's signature thing vocally. I can see how dedicated and how hard she works in everything she does, but I still don't have a good gist of who she is artistically. Like her vibes. She gives so much, sometimes too much. Her energy and power is the highest level, but it's not drawing me in.
Chloe x Halle are my new religion, those vocals THO... Ungodly Hour (the song) it's my favorite, but can we like get a live version of Don't Make It Harder On Me????  pleeeaseee please please please
THE TALENT WHAT??????!!! AND THIS IS LIVE??????
So PERFECTION! ♥️
I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS AND CHLOE. Ugh and Halle is such a vibeeee. 🥺🥺
I just started to really like this song
I swear Halle's voice is hypnotising
There are such a vibe!
I have watched this video an inappropriate number of times. So well done.I am getting Brandy and Aaliyah vibes from these two.
I see they worship the beast as well...half human half robot huh
Their best performance! And the outfits... Absolute stars.
Yes for this Queen of the Night + Janet Jackson look!!! Get it ladies, growing up lovely! A 90s bop!
love chloe's vibe
they have some of the most amazing most unique duo harmonies ever
These lives got me sittin here in hot anticipation of when they perform "Busy Boy"
That run at 2:30 lives in my mind rent free.
Oh my god
#Shouting y'all did that!
Wouaw 😍😍🔥
Literally set the bar
I have been literally watching this everyday just to feel sane
Happy 1M views, queens!!!!

Amo minhas mamães,😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 RAINHAS. Periodt!!!!
2020 ? It is more watching a 2040 MV.
Oh I get why ppl are crazy for them makes perfect sense
epal nagdislike di mahal ng mama nila
Are they twins?  I like this song.
My motto for this year: When you decide you like yourself, holler at me!
So dope🔥🔥🔥
Their vocals are truly angelical, and actually godly 🥰😍
These two reminds me of Beyonce and Kelly love them
I keep watching this y’all are so flawless
Dope
I wish performers would start acknowledging art directing and lighting designers cause the folks who do this did a lot of with a little!
Wow ! I keep watching this video, I loved it so much! This dance, this costume, are for sure the best 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I don't care with nobody say they did the damn thang 💯💯💯❤❤
I would love to see them do a full EP with Disclosure cause this is magic. I think they work so well together ❤
I want to know who their stylist is. Seriously🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Chloe can ruin me anytime :'>>
First of all, I'm gay, second of all, I'm gay, last but not least, I'm gay??
They sound ao good that could be acapella performance. How many artist can do that?
i’d die for this to be put on spotify 🥺
@1.04 is something else.. wow.
The way the harmonize is just breathe-taking.
So MTV would put rain on me in the show but not these two. Embarrassing.
I keep coming back to this song and I don't know why <3
This performance was PERFECTTTT in every imaginable levels
Such beautiful women!
Tudooo pra miiim
I’m in love
Beautiful song
This performance had me like 👁👄👁 the whole time. They killed it.

I've now consider this as a music video instead of a live performance. sooooo ethereal!
Vocal vocals vocals!!!
The voice of Chloe gives me an aura of Ariana
They are perfection

Their singing sounds like they are singing backwards.
Oh wow....speechless.....this is beautiful music as gorgeous as these two angels 🔥❤️
They so magical ✨ love em

Guys stop saying that they should of been in the main show I'm tired of liking all the comments ,I'll continue to though
So beautiful
Talentosas y hermosas

I see Beyoncé teaching them how to dance too
This was such a dazzling performance. I love their energy ♥
Wheeew the vocal stacking, it's a lot too take in, but in a good way lol they delivered!
Nice

🌊👑
These girls are too good! Don't stop plz!
Fuclimg looooove this / them 🙌🏿🧡💫🤤

They both were as iconic as usual, but Chloe was on firreeeeeee she was here to eat, darling!
2:23 - 2:31 that's just shows one of the reasons why she'll be playing Ariel, what a vocals 😍
Y’all were PLAYED.
We don't deserve y'all 😭🤍🤍🤍
SUPER HYPNOTIC SIRENS......YAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS.....GO LADIES....KEEP DOIN' YOU! LOVE IT!!!!💕💕💕💕
What will it take for you to reach ultimate success? as a fan I will do anything
I like them they are good performers and they have great voices. I wish they had better songs and arrangements. I just want to fight there producers. This performance was beautiful though
My boos slayed the VMA's😍😍😍😍🥵
Best song of on MTV 2020 n they have Great 👍 voices 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
god damn the older sister is stacked
YaSSSSS My two favorite voices.  I just wished I liked the songs they sang as much as I loved their vow yes. This is not one of my favorite songs by them = but they always get a watch and listen from me - no matter what these goddesses are doing.
"we've come in peace... and ART!" <3 amazinnnng
They're so in sync, for a moment I thought it was amazing 3D animation I'm still not convinced they're real people
gosh, they like little birds with those high notes and they’re so angelic. also halle’s gaze >>>
They sound SO GOOD LIVE
All the crap on the radio here in London - why don't I here this???😖
iconic.
Wowww @ChloexHalle love it, really amazing. keep bringin and rockinnn  <(-_-)>
PERFEITO DEMAIS, CHEGA
Cute outfit and singing 😚😚😚
The Best, they have my hart😮😍😻❤
Yeesss 😻😻😻😻
I mean 0:12  who is sis harmonising with?.. did the other girl forget to lip sync to part harmony?🤷🏼‍♀️she too busy counting steps in her head
I think the sing they did "do it" was a hole lot better
Stumbled on this video by accident, but glad I did. These girls are fire. Love them 😍
2:43 This riff 🤪
BLACK WOMEN ARE RUNNING THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY - WHY YALL GAGGING SO MUCH‼️‼️ I’m here for the domination 😩😭😭🙏🏿🙏🏿👏🏿💕💕💕
1:47 onwards It's the adlibs for me 🤩 Felt like some extra magic was added to the song. It's the unclarity of the "you're hesitant" for me 😍
Halle has an Angel stuck in her throat because shitttttttt! Every time she opens her mouth Heaven comes out.
The choreo, the lights, the costumes, the singing, all masterful.
🔥🔥🔥
'Ungodly hour'?? What does that mean?
I get chills listening to them
This is amazing! This is the old school R&B sound I remember growing up, with this amazing new twist! Obsessed!!!!!
The whole album is amazing, this performance was godly! So beautiful, I hope their talent takes them far
The LYRICS..
THEY’RE SUPERIOR
Dope!!! Beyoncé knew these could sing sing
Everytime I see them, they wearing less and less clothes...
👍👍👍
Queens serving PERIODT💯👑💯👑💯👑
Chloe's braid was THEE FASHION MOMENT OF THE NIGHT ❤️🖤❤️🖤
Waoooo this voice 🤩🥰
I just can't stop listening and watching 🙈 it's so legendary good
crazy how this was arguably the best performance (conflicted over Doja Cat and CxH) of the evening and this wasn't even on the main show.  QUEENS. i have no option but to stan for life.
wow, this changed my life 😭
amazing
☺️major crush
I´m so addicted to this....
...i think i just died and came back to life fifteen times...
I cant even listen to the album version anymore 😭 this is sooo much better
think they recorded this to the song slowed down
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️👑
THIS VERSION SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON SPOTIFY!!! THEY FUCKING KILLED IT!!!! MY ROOMMATES AND I HAVENT STOPPED WATCHING THIS PERFORMANCE!!!!
they are in a different lane... And its giving me LIFEEE
Hay mucho de magia humana en su existencia por el bien que  inspiras.Asciendo lentamente por la colina de tus descubrimientos  viajando de tus ojos como un ente al que lo definen tus anhelos para  dejarte allí una sencilla huella de amor, de ser así queda en sus manos  en su interpretación, inmensamente agradecido y eternamente tuyo
150%  They handled that !!!
when Halle said "love me love me" i felt a disney child about to pop out of me
Discovered this today and it's given me literal life all day (this and the entire album). I haven't felt so good in all of 2020. God bless and thank you!
Their fan club should be called "the sirens."
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I can't get enough ❤😍🔥
This was amazing, why tf wasn't it on the main stage?
And this ladies and gentlemen is what we were waiting for.
On repeat like crazy over here
ChloeXhalle are just so beautiful, their songs, performance and their style, BEAUTIFUL!!!
BEAM ME UP SCOTTY!
Chloe is killllllllliiiing it! ❤️
This is what happens when your groomed by Beyoncé!
Eu estou no chão,  parabéns
best performance of the night!
She will be the perfect little mermaid
MTV you played yourself. I would’ve watched the entire show just to see them, oh well.
They simply slayed my entire life with this performance
This is so dope!!! Love my girls
Am I the only one who think they should both be Solo artists.    Chloe definitely needs her own shine.
Oof it's too much 😭😭🔥🔥🔥 I cannot
The best of the best. You two are just perfection
Achei que eu tinha morrido e os anjos estavam me chamando
This was the BEST performance of the night no question.
The "loooooovveeeee Meeeeeee" part just hits every single time. OMGAAHH 😩.
Wow, they eat this shit up amazingly amazing 😘😘
I just don’t get how her voice can sound so perfect in live performances. She’s so impressive to watch
Soooooo we not gonna talk about Chole just standing rocking the 30 in ponytail
Can't wait for the live performance of WONDER WHAT SHE THINKS OF ME!!! God, imagine the live vocals!!!
This is why i don’t watch the VMAs anymore cause they don’t know the difference between actual vocals and auto tune .
How does this his have 815 dislike 😒 there is 815 people who go their wigs snatched.
Chloe's run at 2:30 though!
Janet Jackson x Aaliyah x Destinys Child Vibe
I love you both but Chloe is on a different LEVEL!!!!
You WOCKIN over here🎤🎶😂😂love this ladies but the way Halle said: Wockin (walking) with extra emphasis 💀😭
I have watched this multiple times ever since the day it was released and I dont know why but everytime I watch it, it just keeps getting better and better I LOVE YALL CHLOE AND HALLE YALL ARE SO AWESOME
Chloe x Halle and BTS' performance were my favourite for the VMAs. Their mics were ON, and the choreo was fun to watch.
Talento transbordando !!! 😍😍
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
The foil, the laser, the live vocals. THIS IS A SERVE!!!
Am I the only one.. Chloe out there looking thicker than a whole snicker, just saying 👀👀
Lomi lomi lomi lomi lomi lomi 👁👄👁
They definitely brought it!!
Absolutely Amazing!!!
NAME A BETTER PERFORMANCE FROM A TENNIS COURT! I’LL WAIT
THIS IS THE BEST THING IVE EVER HEARD IM CRYING
So special....!
2:31 Amazing 🤯🥰
I am begging a DJ to make a house/dance mix of this song.
Which one is the thicc one?
Yes my Ariel !!!!
thee ungodly hour
Why she sound like beyonce  in the first part
I  come to this channel everyday just to watch this.
This performance is so pure and well done it feels like an official music video.
I love you guys so much ❣️❣️
Okay but the outfits are gorgeous on them. I do be wondering what they are made of like they look so good.
Everything about this is my spirit animal
Perfection
These girls and bts performance geniuses, my favorites
They both have beautiful voices but this music video would of been better if they didn't sing on top of eachothers voices. The beat is just out of this world. I still give this song a 100 out of 10
I love these young ladies
I love this performance! Each time I’m just amazed of how much talent you girls have! It really stole the show from all the Vma performances!
wow... just wow!  :O
1:50
this is my shhhhhh!
Omg the vocal choreography, the best I've ever heard.
This preformance is so underated
im so thankful for them. i am about to get emotional. WHAT. no. there are no words for them.
They are magical fairies and no one can tell me different
I don't think y'all understand that this right here us the future if music
I still can’t believe this is real praise the lord
♥️
The best performance 🙌🏾🔥
Sigo sin superar esta presentación 😢💕
God bless them   Hollywood is a demonic place . Hope they will take there souls back .
Damn Chloe Thicker than COLD OATMEAL!
I’m actually dead. Speaking from the afterlife.
RIP replay Button. Living for the hip ahake at the start.
They sound better live than studio, that's an artist.  Edit: This is probably, as pointed out, prerecorded. The VMA's used to do this show live. But for what I'm seeing on other presentations that's no longer the case. The artists don't choose this btw, it's what the show decides over them, just like a late night show. There was a time when award shows allowed and prepared the artists for singing live. Not many years ago, look at vma's 2016.
Yaassssssss
can't wait to see the little one in the Little Mermaid
La letra me encanta!!
I'm glad performers like this became a thing again before more time passed in my life.
These vocals is giving me life !!
Godly talents!!!
Why do they call it the ungodly hour!!!!!!!!!!
LISTENNNNNN
Apresentação perfeita do começo ao fim 🥺
Ms. Ponytail is on point.
Okay they serving up everything!!! I can’t believe how amazing these two are! They remind me of sirens!
I love it here 🪐💫✨🦾
They are so AMAZING!!! 🔥🔥🔥 I'm 45 years old and they are one of my FAVORITE artists
I will never forgive MTV for putting them at the pre-show🙄
❤️❤️❤️
nah.
Play with that camera sis....yaass!!!  Looks like one of Beyoncé’s old videos, I forgot the name of it.
I have watched your covers on YouTube years ago and thought you both were incredible. I honestly watched this twice and still got chills. Y’all out here snatching wigs lol I love it
Nailed it 🙌🏾
There’s a reason why Beyoncé chose to mentor them 🤤
Woao
This was honestly there BEST performance
searched for it, replayed it, and again and again and again...
0:27... that neck move Chloe made UGHHHH
This was one of the best performances amazing
"love me, love me   love me. Love me, love. Love. Love me. Love me love me love me, Love me." favorite part
Whitney body guard vibes...
They should’ve kept them innocent and respectable.  We didn’t need them to be  all sexualized like everybody else.
I love them. But the title of the album really bothers my soul
I'm feel goosebumps
Lol I’m so loyal to them that I’ve only watched this video from their YouTube channel instead of the MTV channel. That’s how much I want to see them win.
AMAZING ARTISTS! I'm in love! Brasil here
ChloeXHalle deserve more hype. Simple
Omg my fav tracks and its heavenly good 🤍
FIRE!!!!! 🔥
I love it is my favorite!

Man.... Now that was what I call an awesome performance!! Tight work C&H 👏🏿👏🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Iconic as always
The best seizure I ever had.

Can’t wait for people to realize that beds were invented to sleep on them and not on CHLOE AND HALLE
This is Shakira inspired. Movements and style.
MIND》》BLOWN 🤯 Their talent!  Everything was CLEAN. Live performance was flawless.
This is a audiovisual masterpiece! 🤩
I’m so happy for them. I be rocking w them for a min but they really getting big 🥺❤️
the album and this performance define female version of daft punk.
This has Kate Bush vibes! Amazing!
I come back to this several times a day. It'll never get old!
they're so good!
Am I the only one abscess
I'm not saying this to start shit but did Qveen Herby watch this video before she released her song Mission?
Who’s them?!
I'm obsessed with this version
FADASSSSSSSS 💗💗💗💗
This is so amazing 🤩✨
They should’ve been an actual performance and not a pre-show thing. These ladies are the SHIT and they deserve all the recognition.

#BlackExcellence royalty
These two continue to give me exactly what I need! Another brilliant performance, MTV wtf were you thinking?
Halle and Chloe both have individual star power and together, they came to serve. 😫 This is the song I never knew I needed. I can’t wait for them to collab with other super stars and give us bangerss. BEYONCÉ HURRY UP
Vocals are bomb  💣 per usual. Performance was so 🔥🔥 was litterally dancing the whole time. Great job ladies👏🏾🔥🎉
YALL DID NOT HAVE TO SNAP SO HARD!!!! I swear they keep outdoing themselves. Literally every performance keeps getting better and better!!!!

💜💜
Obsessed with them!❤️
Urghhh chills 😩😩😩
Why isn’t this the only thing anyone has spoken abt for 3 days? There is no need to acknowledge anything but this
I need Chloe to lose 10 pounds
Halle at the bridge "Love me...", I can clearly picture Ariel now. Voice of an angel

ANOTHER LEVEL!!
Ya Wawwllkinn over hereeee
Reads title.  Listens to song.  Still has no idea what time the "ungodly hour" is
Safe to say they recycled this year
왜 라이브가 원본 노래보다 더 좋아?
This was fire wow. They served vocals for the Gods
Halle ✨❤
This song is giving me kaytranada vibes 😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Blown away by these ladies.
I’m just confused on how Chloe and Halle aren’t getting the proper recognition they deserve, like wtf are y’all trying to do?
How is the live version better than the studio version? WOW!!!
#realtalent. VMA IS SLEEPING.
Como tem gente que consegue dar deslike nisso ? Pqp
ALL ON A TENNIS COURTTT
Love them 🌟
They ate and didn't leave a single crumb
Beat performance of 2020 VMA
They remind me of 90s R&B queens which I absolutely love. I hope they will gt even bigger. They sound amazing live too.
Modern day Zhane
puta merda, assisto toda hora
That robot they hit!!! ayee yes ive watched everyday lol
10000/10
Как я люблю ваше творчество!
Man fuck! I’m in love with them
Fireeeeee 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
lendas <3
"Welcome to the ungodly hour" ????  REEEAAAALLLY ??? 😒
it's unbelievable how they didn't get a mainstage performance and got snubbed in their nominations. this performance alone won they entire night.
WIGS! SNATCHED! EVERYWHERE!
They are like angels or goddesses.  I had plans to appreciate this in heaven but i'm see now at youtube.
Beyoncé did a good job picking them.
2:22 be hitting hard though
THEM!!!!!
if Disney auto tune halle’s singing in the little mermaid i swear to god🔪
This. Is DOPE af.
THIS WAS THE BIGGEST SERVE FROM THE NIGHT
I know they full...CUZ THEY ATE THIS!😂👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Beautiful performance by these angelic sisters😘🤩😍
Wow.. very nice
I can't believe not one award... But it's okay the masses are always sleeping and over looking true talent bc true talent is a gift from God most people in the industry are devils.. so they will have to fight hard but I don't think they will have a problem at all with Oshun daughter leading the way and their amazing God given talent!! !! Black Girl Magic 🖤🖤
game ovahhhh
Angelically ethereal.
How is this even possible? It is out of this World. Dare I say it is #UNGODLY 😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍🥰
I've been coming here everyday since it came out
Como faz para curtir mais de 1 vez??? EU AMEIIII MELHOR APRESENTAÇÃO!!! ❤️
This should be the official music video
Really nice VMA's let them made a videoclip in the middle of the pre-show. They are amazing.
They sound and look so good
Yes!! 1:24 ✨🤍 “love me ~~~”
Definitely the highlight of the evening. Trusting the process.
WOW, AMAZING
They have such an interesting sound
PERFEITAS CARALHO!!
00
Wow!!!! Chloe x Halle  both are so brilliant!
This was amazing 🥰❤️
Umma need Ppl to stop sleeping on these beautiful ladies, highly talented ladies  ❤❤❤❤❤
These girls are seriously ridiculously talented 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💕
Dope🔥🔥🤘
Meu deus, que perfeição <3
I have heard this song so many times, it's concerning
this just goes to show that the preshow is better than the actual show lmfao
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8C7IFrHTysA
This is INSANE.
We need a remastered deluxe version of "Ungodly Hour" with live productions of the original songs.
Whewwwww the level of fierce in this performance is just so overwhelming in such a good way. These sisters are finding their niche very early in their career which is already proving to be explosive. Also, the album BANGS!
Loved the performance.  One problem:  MTV nor YT did not put up a warning that there would be strobe-like effects on this video.  I personally did not have a problem with this, but someone viewing this and is Epileptic or have migraines might.
definitely inspired for bey's sweet dreams fit
I thoroughly enjoyed this performance! 🤍🤍🤍
❤❤❤❤❤😭😭😭😭
They are just everything
wow man.
Metropolis
This is some carol & Tuesday martian stuff
absolutely stunning - outfits, vocals, stage, everything!!!
I love the afrofuturism aesthetics I always get from them.
Ariel is that you 👀 2:38
Icons ❤️❤️❤️
They just single-handedly normalized healthy dating behavior from men. Holding them accountable through a lens of complete self love. This song is not only amazing musically, the lyrics are literally incredible!
there are small parts that remind me of the song by Jlo - love don't cost a thing
Yeah I like the live version better than the album version
They SERVED UP US SOME REAL THING CALLED INTERMENT!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💃🏽💃🏽
working the CAMERA!!
Jesus Christ is on his way. Believe and Trust in Him for Eternal life and salvation. John 3:16 the world is only gonna get worse by the day. We are living in End times.
WOW WOW WOW!
Wifey 👸🏾🥰🥰
One of their best...they just keep getting better!!!!!
I am hooked on Halle's love me love me love me love me love me...
Chloe's run at 2:30-2:37 sent chills cause wtf 😂😭🔥
❤👌🏼
Their live performances are ALWAYSSSSSS better than the last & the album version!! Like, HOWW?!?! 😭🔥‼
So obsessed with these queens 😭✨
This shit slaps
I love singing with them and learning from them. They are so talented its amazing
Que bellas y que talento 😍🥰😘
They allways sound superb live👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Over rated.
Same sound and voice vibe as Beyoncé sad to see them fail cause of that.
Ungodly Hour Demon Time ...
Ungodly hour??? What in the santanic crap is this?
I love how Halle’s eyes seem to never lose contact with the camera and it feels like she can see you wherever you go. Well-taught at Beyoncé’s piercing stare school
Super amazing
Wow, I’ve never heard this song before but I literally have chills rn. So beautiful!
beautiful babes keep it up !
On God they the only ones that can sing and make tin foil look spectacular😍💖🙏🏾
I love the fact Chloe and Halle and Beyoncé all bounce off each other. I see the  sweet dreams in this and the Beyoncéisms, and you best believe Beyoncé been bouncing off these girls vocals in her more recent work. Loved to seee ittt 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
The. Quality.
I mean damn I gotta say I love the live performances way more than the actual album when u have so many versions lord JUST GIVE THEM THE GRAMMY ALREADY SHIT
Vocês são perfeitas, saibam disso!
I don't care what nobody says. They are dope af! I got Prince, MJ, Beyonce, Janet, Whitney, and all the other greats type vibes from this video!
IMMACULATE. incredible performance!
Their voices are out of this world!!! I can’t wrap my head around how perfect every single live performance looks/sounds. Love them so much
yes.
They shit on these girls but their talent is undeniable. They r here to stay. VMAs aren’t for blk talent. They prove it every year. Again this year. They can sing circles around everyone who won. When will we get it? Stop showing up for their shit.
eu não consigo parar de assistir
Living for Halle in this!
perfeitassss!!!!
These girls eat!! Errytime!! I love them so much!!
I need this version available in Spotify 💕💕💕💕
this has such a relaxed and old school feel to it that i can’t describe but i do know that I. L O V E. IT
Why is this talent so SAVAGE?! They are so good!
This was the only performance that night. Period! No crumbs left
They did amazing they deserved to be on the main stage tbh they both are so young and their musicality is just FUCKING AMAZING they are so underrated their ungodly hour is their breakthrough Beyoncé knew what she was fmding keep up the good work ❤️
WOW

I don’t even know how many times I’ve watched this. They are ✨MESMERIZING!! ✨ 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 they won. They won the year, the century, everyone else can go.
Damn love me some Chole and Halle ✨✨✨💕💕💕💕!!!!!! Queens effortlessly
These two remind me so much of the VanJess sisters
Can't believe they didn't win best quarantine performance
O nível dessa performance é absurda!!!! Patroas <3 <3
Perfection
This was excellent
They look like Angelic Holograms
They should have been a main stage performance
They're kind of incredible.
They are amazing! Perfection
Fucking beautiful in every single way.
Why on earth were they not a part of the main act? Their performances are better than 99% of the industry. They’re the most exciting live act to come along since Beyoncé.
completely obsessed, i meannn...
Chloe’s stage presence is truly out of this world!!
Rewatched this so many times and each time I’m stunned 🤯🤯. Stellar performance🤤🤤
I love them so much!!! They’re performances are outstanding
It was so good
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ive watched this performance 10000000000 times😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😘😘😘😘🔥🔥🔥👼👼👼👼👼👼
This performance is a vibe
ATE THAT SHIT UP 🔥🔥🔥
Me begging for an ungodly hour music video  Me now: yep this will do 😁
beyonce love this
DO I HEAR VMAS OR BE AMAZED CUZ
Their performances from this album have been spectacular and this is no different!
Their voice..... its beautiful!!!!!! So angelic...
I've literally been with here from the start and seen them become what they are today image what they could be in the future.They have so much potential, I love these queens and their music and style are so unique and creative.😍
YESSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
(Chloe) is so fierce and (Halle) is so elegant😍 Gosh, I love this performance!! 😭❤️  Edit: I had the sisters switched up so I edited their names in the parentheses. Now it is correct 👌
Beautiful voices im hypnotize 🥴🤩😍
*C X H,* always reminds me of 90's-00's music
Awesome!! I love their uniqueness!
Looooove themmmm 😍
2:16 No need to thank me
They EAT EVERY PERFORMANCE🔥 it’s the talent fa me...
when i heard people paying attention to that messy performance of gaga and ariana and sleeping on this excellent performance i immediately start believing on white privilege
WOWWWW
I live for this performance, so much. Thanks with me, they will have 1 millions vues !
Why do i keep watching this!!
I love how every live performance from them is a new experience.
This was main show performance material. It's so beautiful.
You two fine things need a beat down ..
They slayed our entire existence😳👀
It's ungodly how insanely beautiful these two are. And their vocals don't sound real. They are ethereal in every aspect and I can't believe they exist and are the same species as me wtf
I love how much they do with tiny movements or even eye contact moving to different cameras. Everything is so deliberate and polished and the result is a stunning performance without any backup dancers. It’s simple done exquisitely. If that’s an influence from Beyoncé, she has mentored them well.
💛💛💛
Beautiful, graceful, voice of angels. These girls are surreal!
Oh, the harmonious vocals, the runs, the hip movements, the futuristic space queen oufits all gave me life! They are so incredibly talented and flat out gorgeous young women!
Brooo I’m crying 😭🔥🔥
I have yet to come across many artistes that are better live than in studio like these ladies are. Amazing! Chloe and her energy are all sass but Halle so laid back and sensual...omg...I just love her ♥♥♥
Okay at 1:48  it felt like 2 vocal dragons intertwining with each other. They have Crazy Vocal ability
Perfection
744k of these views are from me
Es fascinante la limpieza de cada nota y lo que se conocen vocalmente la una a la otra✨👏✨👏✨👏 espectacular, como cada una de sus apariciones. 😍
It takes these two to light up a stage
What does Chloe have on her forehead?
This is the culmination of The Supremes, En Vogue, and Destiny's child.
Eye to camera game is amazing
VOCÊS SÃO EXTREMAMENTE INCRÍVEIS EU FICO SEM PALAVRAS PRA DESCREVER !!!!!!!!
This is soooo good!!
This song is so beautiful it's something about Disclosures production and their vocal delivery that flows well
Ungodly ok the way they are dress🤔
love these girls so dam muchhhhhhhhh
Amazing
Had to watch it twice cause just WOW. They are both so in their pocket here with the vocals, wardrobe, everything! I'm obsessed with them and can't wait for what's next!
They are what was missing. The game needs them and they are delivering amazing!!! This is my favorite song from their album too!
The taallllleeeeennttt✨
Halle so effortless ✨✨✨✨
the gworls came and delivered as expected. mama this is excellence right here
I’m so mesmerised
This is just shocking ily girls so much
drram!
Ok hell yea they have a new fan now how did i not know them?!!
Fantastic. Love them.
Can we get Beyonće for a remix Plz!.... VMA's did these ladies wrong. Absolutely  amazing this performance!. Gave me chills and the costume design and hair man!!
me as soon as the first second played: ugh this is so good
They win.
ANGELSSSS
Absolutely love this album. I would some balance in performance...Chloe giving a tad too much and Halle giving a tad not enough.
we have been fed.
The way this is gonna live rent-free in my mind for months
PLEASE NEVER GO SOLO!!!! S2S2S2
They DID THAT!!!!!!
Chloe and Halle are with out a doubt my top Favorite artist forever
Sooo when the when the actual video coming
tHIS IS CRAZY!!! HOW IS THIS A PRE SHOW.
Tão lindas! Sooooo beautiful!
Idk a singing artist that can perform better. They slay every 1. Ugh 😫
Wait...who are these girls?!?!? This hit my soul
Wow.. me ponen la piel chinita... Definitivamente me encantan! Son super talentosas y bellas!!!!
They should have performed at The VMA’s 😭😭 but they killed it!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️😍
WOW. MY EDGES
This song is underrated
ATEEEEEE!!!!!
They are so talented 😍
Iconic
You two are amazing. Like Beyoncé protégés... it’s kinda like when are you all going to collab but I swear you hear bey all over there music it would be like who’s who 😑👀🙈😶🙉🙈... love you all!!!
🙀👀👀👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿✊🏿
New favorite video to a top tier song
I have played 1.30 over and over again it hits so hard
🔥
they literally ALWAYS serve on these live performances like I’m actually OTF😫😫😫
Eu amo voces
AMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZING!
Wheres your pants
This is GOLD , PERFEITAS DEMAIS
Kinda sounds like Beyoncé’s voice .
This is the best performance of that night
wow!
🥰🥰🥰💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Somehow this song gives me christmas vibess...
This song and their look is bomb
daaaaaaaaaamn!
Perfection wtf 😩😍
This beautiful ♥️♥️♥️♥️
One of them has to have see-through straps on her top! The other doesn't! Jus' sayin'
This look, the arrangement. Magic.
I'm transported back & forth to heaven!!
I must be at least 100,000 of these views.
PERFECT!!!
They are amazing, but hope Hollywood isn’t trying to make them like sex object like other celebrities. They weren’t wearing this kind of outfit before and dancing like Beyoncé. I love their music, no need to change anything. They don’t need to be next Beyoncé or next sexy girl group. They are better than that.
The level of professionalism.... far too much!
eu to viciada nessa musica!!! to ouvindo pela 4° vez. love you <3
Bom dia 😘
I see the industry has new recruits.
LOVE IT.
Sempre perfeitas! ❤️
I thought the girls did brilliant, I’m not a fan of all the darkness but vocals brilliant as always. I must agree though, I just looked up BTS and I was blown away 🙈🙈 sorry girls.
Wow that's was so beautiful
this performance perfect in every way possible! the outfits with the lights and the vocals was out of this world!!! They rly deserve so much more attention and praise!!
these girls are insane!!! i can’t get enough of their performances
Their outfits give me such Hajime Sorayama vibes and I'm 100% here for it
So sexualised 🙁
I don’t care for the vmas but I low key wanna cancel them for not putting these talented artists in the main show. It’s embarrassing, I don’t think they expected for them to bring it this hard but here we are. They outperformed almost everyone. I rest my case
I think I've watched this too many unhealthy times
Wow. Halle is drop dead gorgeous, she’s going to be amazing as Ariel. I’m already thinking about Chloe’s solo career, she’s the absolute full package !
These girls are phenomenal!!!!
This performance was so good Imma just accept this as the official music video cause 😍😍 MY GOD
They are 100× better live! Like i need live albums like yesterday! You girls are divina
I can't believe this is a live performance. The vocals are incredible.
Flawless! The vocals so natural, truly angels.  Hugs from Brazil!
They def needed individual shoot as well
the left one is so cutee
My babies kilt it!!!!🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾💛💛. You’re fav could f*cking NEVA! 🥵🔥.
These are queens of the next generation. We love y’all.
Here before a million
My black queen
vocês são perfeitas
This is so great, I can't stop watching it!  Truly miraculous performance!
Chloe ❤!
Ungodly hour 👀👀👀👀👀👀🤔
Chloe is BODY goals!
That 1920's sound tho 😍
Mind blown!!!!
This video is so hypnotic
Best group everrrrr
the amount of times I've watched this , im not even ashamed 😭 .
These girls are iconic!
Queen Kong Twerk Challenge #MeganTheeStallion #CardiB #Ciara #Beyonce’
Excelentes!
💗💗💗💗💘💘💘💗💗💗💗💗🙌🙏🙏🙏
Beyonce has thought them well. This performance reminds me of Beyonce's Sweet Dreams music video.....that last costume she wears in it- the robotic one. They have really sold their souls💯
I  really adore and love these too...but i am not into their Music at all... maybe its the vocal arrangements ... does that make me bad..
❤️💗💓MAKE THIS GET millions of likes please, I LOVE THEN SOOO MUCHHHH💓💗❤️
love them sm
Quality
0:27 that movement!!
Basically these two are basically if Aaliyah and Beyonce did duo together. Chole and Halle are their own category and unstoppable. Amazing performance.
I can NOT get enough of this! please release this version!!
I’m in love with everything abt this...
Yessssss ladies!!! 🔥🔥🔥😍
The best♥️
They are awesome performers too omg
Come On Door Slam Beat 🔥🔥🔥 1:29 & 3:00
These beauties are just majestic in every way 💎
Wow!!!! THAT WAS FIRE! It like watching fire and water!
I need this outfit! 😍😍
Dressing like Beyonce now? Sweet dreams
Great inspiration for black girls from d are dark ,brown ,to light. I put these two natural Black Queens next to a few Airi Lennox Sza Tierra Whack Rico Nasty Bree Runway etc
the main event, these queens are always ahead of the game. the vocals, the choreography? the fact that they sound even better live? pure and undeniable talent, nobody doing it like them.
Amaaazingggg🥰
You gotta admit you have come back here multiple times after watching for the first time...        *Me? Oh a few dozen times if i actually have to have an accurate estimation.*
So I liked the video before I watched lol ... so now is there away I can like it again?? 😂❤️❤️
THIS PERFORMANCE IS A  MASTERPIECE THAN CNCO.     SERIOUSLY VMA's?
I would love to see their reaction to this video so they can see how bomb they r ✨💫💖
Every time I rewatch this it gets better each time the visuals r everything!!🤩✨
If Beyonce and Solange were a duo... it would be Chloe x Halle
1:02c
Yassssssssssssssssss
I just had a test on genetics and all in biology. After that I came here and as always, I was singing along including the starting introduction.  I sang "DNA" instead of "VMA". Congratulate me.
I can’t believe people still be sleeping on this performance
2020 Belongs to them!
I am SOOO PROUDDD of you guysss!! New supporter since ungodly hour perioddd
Very sad to see young girls becoming sexualized through the influence of Beyonce.
It's just so disrespectful... Like I just grew out my edges and y'all decided to blind me AND snatch them... Imma have tob Start shaving my head bald before I watch y'all cause I'm sick of this 😂😂😂
These looks though
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥beautiful voices
MTV knew these two goddesses would blow any other "performer" out of the water so they had them during the pre-show.
They are just, boss level of the game
I’m wondering what the hell was going on at the VMAs like all these damn performances they have had since quarantine and they have them preforming at the pre-show like- I’m actually mad that MTV did that to them with how good they are and everybody knows it too
Two of the most talented naturally beautiful underated woman because they're black american is sad more talented than that man made Kyle
I love it!!😍😍
Omg, they both have body goals!! So beautiful :3
love.
Better than the albums version omg
QUEEEEEEEENS💖💖💖💖💖
I fucking love them so much 😭💘💘💘
Chloe does to much 🤣
The vocal buildup on this was amazing...the subtle yet natural power of their voices that went from soft and sweet seduction to strong runs without ridiculous volume just goes to show the natural control these young artist have. I am now awake and paying attention!
They get better and better. Truly amazing.   I have loved their voices since I first  heard them sing the national anthem when my Saints played the Panthers in Charlotte on Halloween 2014 in Charlotte, NC. I still have the video.
Awesome performance Beautiful
These girls got it....
imagine not putting this performance on main stage..... i will never that stupid
I see his videos and he smiled out of nowhere and his songs, his voice They are so beautiful ❣️ I just love them.
They are so hot
LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YESSSSSSSS
very artistic.talented. their quality is superior to other acts. but something is not right with their management. if they were white girls they would be more popular among black people.
wow!!!!
Yk even with all the disappointments and pain experienced during 2020  Chloe X Halle have really been a light in my life. Music keeps the world turning.
These two always hypnotizing my gay eyes with their impeccable performances!!
So.. YOURE TELLING ME THAT THIS WASNT THE CLOSER AND THAT AWFUL PERFORMANCE BY BLACK EYED PEAS WERE?? THEY WERE ROBBED!!!
I want the future to look like this.
These beautiful lady's giving me Beyonce, Whitney , and Janet Jackson vibes with these costumes.  Now Let's talk about there vocals  wow!!! so dam amazing and there range is crazy. I hope they do I wonder and baby girl next. Can't wait.
These two are soooo slept on yall need to wake up and see how talented they really are!!
Whoever disliked this.. fight me
wait this was amazing, i might have to start stanning
These girls are EVERYTHING
This is the third time I watched this video today in a span of 2hrs
First album was better. Second album is way too worldly for me. But they did name their album ungodly so maybe they're no longer reppin Christ
THESE 2 Are Miles Better than Any Act Out!!!!!!!!!!WOW!!!!!!!!!!
Damn Chloe kinda thic I didn't know...
Im soooo mad becouse i don't know what part to sing when they sing together! It's on repeat everyday, period
💐👽
Can you do baby girl👉🏽👈🏽💕
Should’ve been main stage. Periodt
Why are they not huge? ..
If they toured in South Korea, they would live for them. Honestly they could revolutionize the way they do music over there.
I love them so much!!!!
Chloe is sooooo ready to pop that thang harder and harder each live performance lol these ladies KILL IT everytime! Proud of them.
Consistently PHENOMENAL!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who’s seriously disliking this ??
👑👑👑👑👑💙💙💙💙
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
TOOOOOO PROUD OF Y’ALLLL😘😘🖤🖤😍😍👑👑👑💪🏿💪🏿🙏🏾😍🥰🥰🥰
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘😘🔥🔥🖤🖤🖤
ALBUM TOO FIREEEEEEE🔥🔥🔥🔥
Éstas chicas son increíblemente talentosas 💅
These girls and the weeknd were the best performances of the night by far
Chloe's hips in the beginning, Halle channeling Kate Bush, the Twin Peaks vibe... This is pure gold.
There's something very alluring about HALLE. Ppl sleep on her because she's not aggressive as her sister is. I was really captivated by her this whole performance.  But I actually enjoyed both of them. Chloe goes real hard every performance. She brings the 🔥 too.
Há muito tempo que não vejo cantoras tão completas, Chloe e Halle.Obrigada por compartilhar esse talento com a gente!!!!
I keep replaying thissss and I’m not even a fan
Would love to hear quince Jones or micheal jackson master of this song.
Halle is so slept on.... her stage presence is like crazy
Fucking. Ethereal. And pure art. These ladies are a force to be reckoned with <3
Reminds me of Beyoncé’s single ladies outfit
Halle at 2:23 Chloe 2:31 😩😩😩😩
i'm --- speechless
Amazing! They look like two goddess
I need this version on spotify like RIGHT NOW
👑💜🌬
i feel "Single Ladies" vibe with these outfits! Very Beyonce! Just love these girls! spot on all the time!
Beautiful
Gostava mais quando faziam cover....
The best thing to happen to music in a long time❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Chloe’s runs!!!!!
I love so much the fact that they have performed songs like ROYL, Busy Boy and Ungodly Hour besides the biggest hit Do It, it shows how much they believe in their album as a whole body of work.
Oh my goodness they are so beautiful, and mesmerizing. They win win it ALL next year!
Awww my Angels....❤️
Giving me Whitney Houston “Queen of the night” vibes with the outfit 🙌🏾🙌🏾 So talented these two 😍
I just love how they sound old school and new school in the same song.
Don't know why but they remind me of the r&b duo Zhane from the 90s! I love it.
😒The title fit them so well they are so ungodly🙏🙏🙏 We need to pray for this generation😳🙇
Chloe  bodied this one. The sudden fire around half of it is magical
Brilliant
Rocknation Sure turned Chloe and Halie into sex symbols real quick. The more I see them,  the more skin I see. So sad.  FAAJR1
<3333
They did so fucking well.
Their voicesssss 💟💟💟💟
That was FIRE.They brought R&B back in a wonderful way.
I was mesmerized!
They sound awesome....
_stunning_
THIS WAS THE BEST PERFORMANCE. PERIODT.
Their harmonies are so perfect it's scary. And they are so beautiful. And the loc styles they be having!!!! 😍. Basically I love these ladies 🖤🖤🖤.
Omg the TALENT! They deserves so many awards. The performance, the outfits, their voices, it's all incredible
this was EVERYTHING !
wow
I am mesmerised
They're so synced... When they adlib,they are still in unison, never oversinging the other.  My headphones are blasting harmonious skills.
Halle is so effortlessly gorgeous, her voice just gets me every time, that run at the end. Subtle but still life giving. I STAN
I have no idea who these girls are and what everyone one is talking about .i just stumbled on this video and decided to look at it and boy they have beautiful voices they harmonize really well together plus the song is very nice also!
Loved this performance and loved this song, they are so underrated
It's the talent for me
*THE SERVE, THE VOCALS* 😫
Donas de TUDO!
There hating. we all know that chloe and halle is the shit and black people are just better like cmon now. but theyll prosper in the end like we always do.
I luv them
Does anyone else feel like they’re watching Eartha Kitt when Halle Bailey sings?! She’s almost a spitting imagine and her voice is very similar!
I've said it before, and I will say it again, and thousand times, Our Angelic Sirens NEVER DISAPPOINT!
they are amazingly talented, by they need some catchy songs. everything I've heard from them so far is very generic melody wise
Omggg😍😍😍🔥
Gorgeous song!!! 🌺😻
Just here to say its been on REPEAT ✨💖 what a vibe ✨🙏🏼😩
ARTISTAS
Halle with that smooth siren sensuality. Girl's barely moving but my eyes go straight to her. It's all in the eyes man, and that little smirk.
Idk how these Queens make it look effortless but they’re dipped in ethereal talent 🖤
Love from Brazil 🇧🇷
when they sang the bridge I legit got chills. gorgeous.
I love this song. Rifs and runs..omg..they too young to know how to do that...👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
They are amazing. Keep going.sexy young classy soulful. And can saaanng.
SO PERFECT! AMAZING PERMORMANCE, LOVE FROM BRAZIL <3
Ok but when did Chloe get so thicc like scrumdidiliumtious. Love this group!
This is song that I loved the most from the album and I’m glad y’all decided to perform this. People don’t appreciate it enough.
They are winners in my eyes all day everyday. 👌🏾✨✨😻😻😻

Holy shit this is so good.
It's the whole Victoria secret runway routine for me. They ate everything on the main stage, and that's period.
God doesn't get the same attention as celebs anymore 😔🙏
This 90s, early 2000s vibe is EVERYTHING 🥺
I'm just mesmerized by their talent, their outfits, their face, their song, everything about them, they're bigger than some of that shit out there in the mainstream
They are FLAWLESS
The raw vocals, the outfits.. my eyes are just so blessed by these beautiful women
Love them
How angelic voices. Smooth, crisp. I never heard them but will follow. Have an.old school.classic vibe in voice. Excellent.
Yasssss
Whatever y'all do not separate them or make one feel better than other 👑🥂👑 one for left eye one for my right
God I love them so much
Chloe caught the Holy Ghost in those last 30 seconds!!
The industry taking off y'all clothes ...
The passion in the older sister's movements is pure talent. I don't want to start anything but i think these two should split and go solo. They are both beyond amazing in they own way.
I’ve been waiting for this performance! This song, the visuals, the vocals! No one’s doing it like Chloe and Halle
Put some clothes on please thank you!, Can’t take another sexualized group of girls coming down the line a few years from now talking about how they were sexually assaulted by people in the industry!, Stop the madness now before it even starts! Money cannot ever easy abuse once it happens!!!!!
I’m a fan for life at this point! Artistic excellence. You can tell they’ve studied the greats, the quality of their performances makes established pop stars look lazy.
Love them so much !! Nothing, but 🔥🔥🔥 from them ALWAYS.
i can’t believe ppl are still sleeping on these two
They did the damn thingggg. I’m in amazement
Very talented young ladies. I love their music.
this is perfection
Look at these queens :)
They feel 90s while at the same time having their own style it’s hard to explain
Heaven sent. 😍🥰
Las vi en los Vmas por primera vez y quede en shock
SMH! Smh!!! This was fuckin DOPE!!! Like FIRE!!! Like Beyoncé performing fire!!!! Wow girls!!! Thank you!!!
Very beautiful voices, my only reservation was everything else including the lyrics, I was young once and remember certain songs having certain words to it and I thought it artistic and hip but the woman next door would tell me it was blasphemy and the devil's music, all I could think was how this old woman is making a huge deal about the music and everything to her was the devil, now that I am older all I have to say is " Everything is the devil" Father in the highest heaven who sits on the highest throne with none above him and father of my saviour and Lord Christ have mercy on the fools in this world  father, forgive their pride , blindness, and silence.  Ladies and gentlemen you are the reason these girls stand before you as satanic slaves, the depravity required to get to that level required is unspeakable and it won't stop with them, many more will fall victim, I am sorry but all the information out there exposing these things is just overwhelming and in huge quantity, if you can't wake up and see truth in coincidentally year 2020, which for your eyes means perfect vision , clarity, seeing what's there minus the blur, and continue to support this, because that is the only reason it exist, you power it with support therefore hold a portion of the blame, no one told these girls they didn't have to sign their souls away to be beautiful loved performers, no they felt the pressure to be this for you and for likes, I am sure they were lied to and told there are a million girls like them that if they didn't sign they were done, and they were not confident in their own selves and God because you all back the industry of demons, I pray In stead of praising them, show them how to praise God for all glory be his in Christ name Amen, please help them before it's to late realize they are and have been perfect all this time to step out of the ungodly hour and embrace the joyful loving merciful eternal hour by accepting Christ and praising God with this angelic voices.
Why are people sleeping on them. I don't get it.
I'm so energised by this .
Ive watched this an unhealthy amount of times but it’s so good
1:08 Girl I— 😳
how tf is doja #7 on trending but they’re #46 ridiculous🤦🏽‍♀️
elas são perfeitas porraaaa
BABY,THIS WAS A GREAT PERFORMANCE
I love them both no need to compare them because they both give me something different and I am in love with the black girl magic that they give me
That run at 2:31 was--👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 They outdo themselves every performance, which is why I would've loved to see them on the main show stage
Here before it hit 1 mil
Only the real ones remember them from Let it Shine
The better have won an award because they are way to amazing
Damn these two sisters 👯‍♀️ so much talent. Though this was more a Beyonce type song, these two are more rock I reckon. loving the change in notation, very sunset 🌅
Chloe's thighs are my new religion.
Flawless ❤️
Giving me vibes of Beyoncé’s sweet dreams outfit 😍
I can't stop watching this video! If the VMA's were more like this than a circus I would watch it more. This video is stellar I had no idea who those two ladies were until this performance, I went directly to their album and hit download.
CHLOE’S RUNS AT THE END OH MYYYY GODDDD
Came to see the VMA's. No need to see the rest of it lol. Job well done ladies as always.
Best preformance of the night literally
I've watched like 58 times
“vmas” that was amazing🥵
I said this summer belonged to them, 2020 onwards is really theirs for the taking
This is 🔥🔥🔥
Please Repent for your sins and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior!
Ungodly hour and The kids are alright!!! Two banger albums back to back... y’all future is bright
Love this song. Does anyone hear the underwater theme from Mario 64 I hear it on loop
Incríveis
Just sitting here waiting for a Chloe Halle and Beyoncé Collab.
This performance is very simple yet so beautiful. So glad I unmute this vid on twitter and heard their godly voices. I stan ❤️

Ladies take my money and sing for me every night, please. I need to feel a powerful bitch every day.
The live sounds better than the album!
They washed up everyone who were part of the main show!
they should collab with Daft Punk.... omg vocals n beat would ruin us!!!!
whos this girls? they kill me
These queens should have been in the show, periodt!

i'm sorry but MTV really be trippin not giving them best quarantine performance
This performance was better than the entire VMA's .
they really serve each time.
they deserved best quarantine performance idc idc
These ladies are so talented 🤩
Who is the designer who made their amazing outfits?
Dance ✔ Vocal ✔ Visual ✔ Style ✔ Song ✔ Note ✔ ❤ Wonderful Perfomance ❤
please blow up, please blow up, please blow up, PLEASE BLOW UP....... just blow up man
Simplemente hermosas,  lindas voces !!
yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Maravilhosas rainhas da noite
the lvl of disrespect shown by  MTV and the biased behavior is truly UNGODLY .  They were far much better , i repeat B-E-T-T-E-R than each and every performer ( not artist, cuz hardly there were any . most ppl there were not artists but mere fake performers .)
I like it
anyone who thumbs down this performance...your mama shoulda swallowed
they ate daft punk up
vmas wrong for putting them on the pre show instead of the main show I said what I said
You can see Beyoncé approved this. Perfection.
Should've Won "Best Quarantine Performance"
They really deserve better bc this performance ATE. WHO ELSE DOIN IT LIKE THIS
I honestly can't stop watching this performance! It's amazing and those vocals! 😭🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
All of this is perfect 🥺
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Iconic
Hellbound.
Yess they're voices are like velvet and silk beautiful girls i hope they never change they're good, classy image for the industry.
I can't get enough of this i've watched for more than ten times now
the vocal prowess, that's it that's the whole comment lol
Chloe energy and stage presence is so Beyoncé vibes. And Halle voice and little eye smiles she gives is dangerously beautiful.
CHLOE WAS FEELING IT!!!! You can see it all in the facial expressions 😂
Everything on this video is AMAZING
I want Halle to make a solo album.  They sound great together but they would sound as phenomenal solo too
🖤🖤🖤
Is it just me or does it seem like Chloe sometimes seems like she tries to outshine (standout more) when performing with her sister?
Theyre so talented and beautiful, its a shame their soul doesnt come thru the songs since its completely produced by the industry. I hope they can break through with their own voice ans unique style
It’s Halle for meee
Las amo ya tienen un fan 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
everything Chloe x Halle drop is a bop
R&B?  🤔
QUEENS
This is a serve
Alright girls go ahead and show out then!! I actually like this song too!! 😃😃 👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏🙏
This song title is so evil... are they antichrist
Stunning
"welcome to the ungodly hour" took me out
Don’t worry Chloe and Halle. I can love you every ungodly hour and more.
Lol the mics weren’t even plugged in lol
🇧🇷 🇧🇷 🇧🇷
i can hear Jill Scott's influence here with the high melisma brilliant performance!
Whew! What an amazing performance! Great job, ladies!
Impecáveis
Incredible as usual. What a performance! 👏🏾🤲🏾❤️
Amo forever!
YAAAAAS
These young women SANG! The choreo...the stage presence.....costumes! All amazing!! Proud of them and the stellar work music they are putting out there!
OMG this is soooo good! ❤ Love seeing Chloe x Halle singing live. They deserved the world
the VISUALSSSS
It should be 1 trending
Why is 45 trending
Biiiihhhhh 🤒 my whole face turned sideways and I didn't even feel me move..
Why this generic crap trending
They sing beautifully it was an amazing performance
I never thought much about These two women.  After watching this performance I’m a believer.  You have made a Fan out of me.  Keep up the good work. 🔥🔥🔥
Chloe is a beast
Such a great performance 🔥

👌👌👌
Getttt itttttttt
THESE KWEEEEENZ ARE GONNA BE BIG!!! THE TALENTTTT, OH PLS 😩💕
Fuck y’all did the damn thing ! Giving me mama bey vibes ! Good job girls 😭❤️
Simply amazing. <3
Wow, it's interesting how different their dancing style is. Both amazing but I prefer how effortlessly Halle moves.
Chloe thick okkkkkk 😂💕 i love Halle voice they are the bomb
WOOOW love it !
My third time listening 🤩
😮
💜✨
Now this was the best performance of the VMA's
NOW THATS HOW YOU DO AN ALBUM TITTLEEEEEEEE
It was an ungodly hour when they wore that attire, dress like you respect yourself and people would show you more respect and value you for the wonderfully talented women you are without all the made up exterior! #ValueYourWorth
its crazy to think that they we're disney stars and are now saying "Shit" and wearing sexual ass outfits.
You can tell how badly Chloe wants to go solo
When life gives you a Hundred reason to Breakdown and Cry.. Show your life that you Have a MILLION reasons To SMILE and LAUGH💫✨ Stay Strong, Safe and Positive❤️ Live happily💕
I had to come and comment again that’s how you work a camera 🎥 complete eye contact the whole time

Their style is changing
This is soooo Main Show woth it as hell!!! Damn!! Love it 😍😍😍
So you have to be your own teacher and your own disciple, and there is no teacher outside. You, yourself, have to change and therefore; you have to learn to observe, to know yourself.
Sounds like 2 beautiful mermaids singing a lullaby
They just get better and better, this is true star quality!!!!!!!!!
Wow chloe sounds different.and it's very nice💖💜❤ and halle too💖💜😘
No matter how many performances I see from them, they always outdo themselves. ✨✨ They are so amazing 😭😭😭❤️❤️💗💗
Addictive!!!! Very beautiful!
It looks dis performed with her being so thick than the other
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 amei!
I know their names but i don't know which is but the big girl is really forcing her moves
I dont get what they're wearing they look like TRANSFORMERS
I'm unfamiliar with their work, but I must admit, the few clips that I HAVE caught... are fresh works of art.  Someone recommend some tunes to me
I'm straight, I'm straight, I'm-
Talent ✅
Awesome entertainment  and Beautiful  voices
when halle sings the love me love me love me love love me  all i hear is disney princess material she’s perfect
Lindas 😍😍😍
i’ve been listening to this nonstop for 2 days please it’s so beautiful
Obama girls grew up so fast.
no disrespect to these two young beauties but unGodly hour is not the best title...i mean the SEALS are breaking rn . js
Phenomenal and incredible...beyond dope.
These girls have always been amazing vocally! They have their own sense of style. And i am glad Beyonce has pucked them up. The only thing i cant help but to see there sense of style and dress and now there vocals too much appearing like Beyonce especially in this video. Makes me wounder now...they should always try to be true to thy self...but i guess if someone else is writing the check you do what your told right!?!! 🤷🏽‍♀️ They will always rank top vocally!
I wanna clap her cheats
regend
They make me so happy
The image is taking from everything and somebody tell the older sister to please calm down
The best , amazing!!!!
I wanted a Forgive me perfomance so bad But this is good.
These women are IT 🙌🏿💪🏿❤️
I watched this too many times 🤧 hold up let me watch it again!
why wasn't this in the main show? ohh yea.. it's MTV. they forgot what actual talent sounds like.
Their like mini Beyoncé’s lol
Autotune: “do you think i’m a joke?”  SERIOUSLY THEY DONT EVEN NEED IT-
Sooooo proud ♥️
I'm deceased
when their hips went ⬅️ i felt that
It's the EVERYTHING for me.
I thought they were Christian singers what are they doing half naked. Man you can't trust no one these days. Parents watch who your children are following 🧐
Wow just wow... That's what a world class performance is...
Outstanding Ladies!!!
Ive had this song rolling in my head. I love how chloe is doing it flawlessly and halle is going hard. They are a perfect duo. Amazing sounds like angels.
Those girls are so talent!!!!
Getting EnVogue vibes and I’m here for it
What I love about these ones smooth and elegant  whats his it harder with the dynamics  they compliment each other VERY nicely and they Keep progressing more and more. Love it! Major plus No1 is out at the moment like them.
Casa comigo nunca te pedi nada
For all the ppl saying they did better or deserve better, they are still new it doesn't work like that also Chloe needs more training on performance not expressions she hasn't reached the stage yet where she needs to to all that extra stuff just keep it cute like Halle ✌also when they perform I get 2 performance happening instead of 1 don't know what's going on but Chloe needs to learn professional from personal. Also stop saying they need to win back to them being new they have to work hard and we as fans have to maintain that. The lady's look gorgeous 😍
They made MTV look like fools with this presentation because it was better than many of the others
😍😍😍😍
Every time I watch this I hear new background vocals .... I’m in love
2020 and now the kids are singing and dancing to songs called Ungodly Hour... Don’t You dare ask what’s wrong with the Youth.
yup yup
I'm loving everything Chloe and halle right now. they are working so hard! this will pay off. needless to say, incredible performance.
First saw them years ago at Beyonce her formation tour. They are good good
Yasss...I'm LOVING the Whitney Houston "Queen of the Night" vibes♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Why do female singers have to dress like sex  workers?
The disrespect the industry gives you is pissed me and my home girls off!!
Chloe really popped off here and I’m here for it
eu vou amar vcs pra sempre!
I never had so much goosebumps on these era music 😭😭😭😭😭
EXCUSE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am a lesbian,. that Is All.
não consigo parar de assistir. perfeitas. donas do meu coração!
Their voices give me chills! 😍
I love this they are so creative
Can we please get them a number they de rave so much more of a bigger spotlight 🌹
1:45 Halle sounds like Snow White 😍
Girls, you're ideal! Just perfect and the best!
I hate bein that person but i hate the VMAs is basically a white washed version of our sound and women like this wont ever get the proper recognition for a sound WE created. Smh. Great performance girls.
Yesssssssssss
I love this fuckn song! My fav on the album. Hearin it live is dope.
I’m addicted ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I could just sit and listen to Halle talk, sing, hum anything at all I love how pure and calm she is... & chloe is just so grown and sexy
AMAZING
I’m about to sleeping on these girlzzzzz
Those vocals!!!!  Wow!!
the vocals were flawless
This performance should have been a part of the main show; definitely a missed opportunity by MTV.
un-godly hour... beyocé bought the soul of these girls
Y'all be overhyping Halle because of the Ariel thing but hey, CHOE!? She nailed that too, I mean- those vocals? That stamina when performing? I won't even compare her to anyone, but those cut sharp and deep.
This is the BEST fvcking live performance i've ever seen! GOOSEBUMPS! Chloe x Halle will be BIG! Beyonce made the best decision to sign them as artists.
those vocals, stage presence, visuals, style, dance, and TALENT dbdbdbjdjdkdkd!!!
https://youtu.be/H3JrdCtB7Rkl
Halle is on the left??
Ok, I’m too old to be crushing on either of them, Imma head on out 😂
VMA's about to be amazed🎙🎧📻🎶
Chloe is everything❤️❤️❤️🔥👍🏿
How is this not blowing up EVERYWHERE? I loved this song from the moment I listened
honestly I really hoped they would perform do it but still this is such a great performance
I love
I love they reproduce track vocals 200% of the time like, they even have the vocal capacity to switch it up and I love. MTV u took an L on this one
I want Chloe to play young Nina Simone whenever anyone should make a biopic of the goddess that is worth her magnificence.
My favorite song from the album.😍😍😍😍
They are so just everything!!!!
They look like angels sent from heaven😭😭❤️ #sobeautiful
They sound soo much better live
Flawless as usual
Halle's voice is like the one of an angel.
I’m obsessed with this!!!!!!!
Little mermaid let’s go
the best performance.PERIOD
Want to drop a comment to know that I was present before 1mil views 😍
Arial needs better vocal lessons.
Most consistent artist of this generation & still don't get the credit these two deserve. REAL MUSICIANS WHO ARE BOTH ARTIST
They look like beyonce apprentices. Which is awesome. I still love beyonce but they are kind of giving  me that vibe.
This is the best performance ever🤩🤩🤩. All they need to do is perform ‘Don’t make it harder on me’ then all will be right with the world🥺😭
This performance just gave me chills! Both are so beautiful
This video is so hypnotic. They deserve more respect and accolades because of their music and amazing talent (esp live)
THEY DESERVE MORE VIEWS
how are plants or other animals going to out-survive selfish women who think they are more important than plants?
THEY SNAPPED ON THIS!!! I LOVE THEM!
their production value amazes me. Every little detail, they have thought through. I'm excited every time I watch them perform, it's a shame they didn't get to do this on the main show.
their vocals just MELT me omgggg
Omg they killed this performance like they do all their lives. Like some one said before. They can sing 1 song 100 times, 100 different ways. They are amazing. And I didn’t like this song until I watched them perform it. Now I love it. 😍😍😍
HELP!  Mongolia. https://youtu.be/I9MYTuiwKK4
@VMAs need a Hotline or Mailing address cause biiiiiiiiiiiitch I GOT SOME SHIT TO SAY BOUT HOW YOU DID THESE ICONSSSSSS. No mainshow?! No best quarantine performance?! liiiike...?
This is nice video.   I have watched the video at least a hundred times, It was the best video I have ever seen.  Let's watch another beautiful video https://youtu.be/YlREycs-040
Halle reminds me of Aaliyah, so effortless with everything she does
I STAN chloe. That run at 2.47 did it for me. They serve all the food at once. Halle is so effortless.  She moves like a knife through butter and chloe reminds me of a young bey.
Que perfeição 😍
..... this is absolutely awesome   Speechless! You ladies are so beautiful and hypnotic!  Keep up the art and class! ♥️🐻✝️
Whoa... this is probably one of the best live performances I've seen this year. I knew they can actually sing but I didn't realize they can saaaang!!!
Love the look reminds me of beyonce sweet dreams but they did so good I done watched this 50 times already just beautiful ❤️💕
Vocals 🔥😩yes throats 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🖤🖤🖤
These outfits are are tribute to Whitney Houston....Queen of the Night.
Wow they killed it! Vocals always on 100. & Dance and outfits 🔥
I'm not going to lie I was sleeping on them well let's just say I'm woke now. Let me check the album out.
"Sisters"  got it going on.   They are full package.
Hands down best part of 2020 VMA’s
I’m not a fan of them but why wasn’t this in the main show???? Wtf this is so good
Biggest snub of the night they deserved every award and the main stage
Whew Chile Dear Mtv you don’t deserve chloe x halle they’re way too good for you mtv #notsorry
Definitely getting some 90's Janet Jackson vibe from these two
They killed it the most sorry not sorry,  Chloe x halle + vocals + choreography + lights ONLY ONLY can u understand that... iconic #blackgirlsMagic period 🗣💕
REAL TALENT NEVER GETS MAINSTREAM PUPLICITY, ANYONE WITH MORALS AND KNOWLEDGE OF SELF IS A THREAT TO THIS WICKED WORLD
DEVIL PUPPETS WILL DO ANYTHING FOR SO CALLED FAME..SMFH
Goddesses !!
OMG amazing!!!!!
I can’t put into words how beautiful and literally perfect this performance is. Every single thing about it was utter perfection and the epitome of beauty. Literal icons.
@joanne ward all of them especially christine dont look black anymore they look mixed or bi racial from lightening &bleaching their skin using that japanese lotion.They should just admit it instead of denying it https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/1-best-seller-extra-strength-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml   this is apparently the same lotion that hollywood celebrities have been using for years to lighten their skin.many arent honest about it saying they have some medical condition but i mean come on they dont look completely black anymore its looks like their skin is wayyyy  lighter now.
how did they just out do themselves on their on song ? HOW ?
WAKE UP! The Tribulations are coming very soon! Jesus will be returning near the end of the tribulations! Repent now! Turn away from your sins and follow Jesus Christ who died for your sins! All the world events have been prophesied, they have been predicted in the Bible and are happening right now! Storms, earthquakes, flooding, fires, locusts, asteroids, and rioting (lawlessness/sin). Many nations are going to form an alliance and attack Israel. There are going to be famines and tons of extreme destructive weather and sickness. The world is going to follow the New World Order in which everyone is united under one government and it will be an evil one. They will pretend to be peaceful and loving, but when the time comes they will tear the world apart and start killing everyone. "For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. (Matthew 24:7 King James Version)" "And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. (Luke 21:11 King James Version)" "And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke (Joel 2:30 King James Version)" . You are all sinners, just like me! You are wicked and live in lies! Repent now or you will be thrown into the pit of fire! The wages of sin are death! "23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23 King James Version) Here is the good news! You can be saved, and taken out of the world before this time comes and be with Jesus Christ! "16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. (John 3:16 King James Version)" "15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: (1 Corinthians 15:1-4 King James Version)" . ABC's of Salvation (How to be Saved): "9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. (Romans 10:9-10 King James Version)" Admit you're a sinner and that you need to be saved and forgiven, and that you can't enter into Heaven by your own works but by Jesus Christ. Believe in Jesus Christ truly with all your heart and that He died on the cross for your sins, and rose on the third day. Commit/Call to God with all of your heart, and pray to God. Ask for forgiveness and to be given the gift of salvation and to be sealed by the Holy Spirit. REPENT! . Then continue to walk in His light, and hold His hand and let Him guide you through life and protect you. No one can take you out of His hand. "28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.  29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.  30 I and my Father are one. (John 10:28-30 King James Version)" . "40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. (John 6:40 KJV)" . Thanks be to God forever and ever! Glory be to God forever and ever! God bless you! Amen.
These girls deserve so much more.
VMA's comes every year so why so obsessed please explain
VMA's comes every year so why so obsessed please explain
*Hey to you reading* ... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” *www.soul.fish*
I loved this performance 🎶🤯
Wow the title " Ungodly hour" is right. First subliminal then direct to the point. They really testing the limits and its creepy up on the public. I see it coming. The next popular group then "new Beyonce."
anyone else notice the timbre of chloe’s voice at 1:04? it’s especially clear in her line at 2:09. i’ve never heard her sing exactly like that & it is pleasing to me and my homegirls
Yes love them 🥰💖
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
IM LOWKEY MAD HALLE’S BRIDGE GOT CUT SHORT. I LOVE WHEN SHE SINGS ℓσνє мє ✨ℓσνє мє✨ℓσνє мє✨ℓσνє мє✨ℓσνє мє 😩
😍😘😍😍
Yo i fucks with this heavy. the the dance the fits and especially the song one of the best in the album next to tipsy and forgive me. Yall look amazing❤
just like the VMAs, these 445 dislikes don't know what talent is.
Absolutely deserved main stage and Best Quarantine Performance
They’re very talented! But just looking at those outfits my legs start chaffing 😂😭😩
We honestly do not deserve them 😫
Beyoncé/park wood is definitely sabotaging their careers.
I just keep replaying "VMAAAAAAAAAAAAS"
Replay. On repeat. Love this song now. Trending foreva
Big Yemaya y Oshun energy  @blkgirlaffirming on IG
at 2:40 was the transition to my outer body experience!!!!
This is a Hot Record! Bravo!
I don’t even know them and they’re my favorite vma performance! Beautiful!!!
Should be single of the year!!!
This is who I think I am in my shower concerts & 3am bedroom concerts.
The run on 2:30 HAS BEEN ON REPEAT!
Thats what a great artists do. They give always excellence, quality, innovation and that aesthetic factor. Not everyone can do, what these beautiful girls are doing right now. They are going to be hugeeeee!!!! 😍😍😍😍💗💗💗 This is the future!!!
They could have cut out some of these Lady Gaga  performances and Chole and Halie a spot.
THEY DID THAT
THE MICS ARE ON!!!
They are being blatant. Now.
The whole world is set up to show Consequences. For doing wrong. All have lied and stolen and looked with lust. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. The wages of sin is death 💀 🔥 but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness , and to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity. 1 John 2:17. Visual Bible movies 🎥, and audio bible NKJV on YouTube
Hear me out.. I love them but this was the worst compared to what they've been doing. Idk if it's the song choice but I really disliked this. This is the vmas. Now that I read they were the preshow maybe why. But they have been way more visually pleasing than this. Look at dojas performance. Gaga. But once again main stage artist. Vocals were killer but this performance juss honestly didn't hit for me. Sorry
More of these Queens, please.
Listen Chloe is sickening and she fucking knows it !
Extraordinary
That "You, you, you, like you, you, you , like you" has Beyonce all over it.  And @ 2:22 is pure Chloe x Halle. Lovely.
These girls vocals are insane. They are sooooo underrated.
Only people who didn't come from *tik tok* can like this
OMG! Loved that! 😍😍😍
YASS QUEENS
I’ve watched this about 45 times throughout the day
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos🎈Non-Duality
they’re gorgeous
duas rainhas!!!!
Love so much guys
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
They really are perfection in my eyes
Sorry but they bore the crap outta me. Talented though

meu deus perfeitas dms 🤧🤧🤧
They’re amazing performers.....visuals on point as always
The walk tho......whew chile
El vestuario... Muy PAPARAZZI  de Lady gaga!!! 😏
Maybe I should get me a tennis court cuz clearly I have learned that they are completely multi-purpose than just tennis. I'm gonna throw some bbq parties, mini concerts, table talks, races, hide n seek w/removable foliage.
The vocals the bawwdyy the outfit the everything just 🥺🥰🥺🥰🥺🥰
LOL trash
We all gonna die one day, so put your faith in Jesus Christ and you will have eternal life in God's presence! If you don't believe in Jesus Christ as your lord and savior you will experience eternal separation from God, aka hell where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Love them ! 😩😩
Let’s be honest. They are only underrated & never getting much attention as they should because they aren’t the typical group that breaks up within a month of them making a hit!!💕
"Did you bring our outfits??"  Someone pulls out a roll of aluminum foil.
black queens
SO GOOOOOD!!!!!! AHHHHH!!!
They get it right Everytime...this show didn't deserve them though
My God this video,  outfits,  voices and beauty is otherworldly superb!!!
Why they are so underrated?
THIS IS SO LOVELLYYYYYY
THE WAY THIS COULD LITERALLY BE THE MUSIC VIDEO
YEEEEEEEES
They are so baddd mannnn😍😍😍
I done watched this bout 5x in a hour somebody take my phone😭I can’t stop watching
CHILLZ that’s what I’m getting when I watch this video.
Voices are out of this world amazing 👏
These Two Continuously Amaze me with their BRILLIANCE!!!! They are BREATHTAKING!!!!!
Show me a flaw and I will show you a hater.
Without the crowd these singers are lip syncing playing dress up
literally 99% of people wont see this but god bless you and stay safe during these times. ps I am trying to reach 100: subs
there are no words to describe this performance like....they are everything
this gave me CHILLS   they are so talented omg
I can't stop listening to it!!!🥺✨
Chloe's energy is something else, and Halle is just too fucking smooth. Perfect combination.
Cyborg references. AI technology already here. They are beyonce's protegies thats for sure. I really liked them buy Yeahua opened my eyes to this demonic system they are in. In a triangle and all.. smhhh..please repent and accept Jesus as Lord and not the white Jesus they tell you He was. HEBREW BLACK MAN. WAKE UP MY PEOPLE WE ARE CHOSEN. IGNORANT IN HISTORY AND GENTILES HAVE BEEN GRAFTED IN. IT WAS FINISHED AT CROSS BUT WE STILL NEED SALVATION FROM YESHUA.
Chloe and Halle are an accurate example of society not wanting to see black women succeed.
2:30 & 2:43 Were INSANE !!!!!!!! Also 3:06 Was My Favorite
BEAUTIFUL!!!!💖💖💖💖💖
Now playback is a bad bitch
Eu apoio um feat com a YZA.
They kill ERtime that beautiful range sheesh!
Yess lyrics

Ugh Chloe is the whole package! I’m sick

Bad axxxxxxx all the time!!
Absolutely Beautiful!
Jesus Christ, who was from the very beginning, the eternal and almighty God, is light and in him there is no darkness at all. He is that true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not. He came unto his own people and his own received him not. Therefore he bid all, even as many as will receive him to attain the power to become the sons of God. Being not born of blood, nor of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God.   I used to be a sinner who was a lover of pleasures in the world and in the flesh more than a lover of God. But then something got a hold of me. Something that the world, seemingly now, more than ever lacks. The fear of God got a hold of me. For the fear of God is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God. When I was born again I was able to see the difference between the light and the darkness. I then knew the holiness and righteousness and the wrath of God that surpasses the comprehension of the natural man. I realized that I was, quite literally as they say, on the highway to Hell. Even as quickly as the fear of God and the fear of death and the fear of eternal torment in the fire of hell where the worm never dies and fire in never quenched gripped my heart and mind, God showed me an escape. It was his plan before the foundation of the world, before he breathed his breath of life into man, before he ever said, Let there be light. It was the spotless lamb who was slain before the world was, that is Jesus Christ. The almighty God, nearly 2000 years ago begat a Son in the womb of a woman and called him by his OWN name, JESUS which being interpreted means the One which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty who has come in the flesh to save us. The invisible, eternal, Almighty God was manifest in the flesh, seen of men and angels and the apostles of Jesus Christ beheld the Word of Life in the image of his only begotten Son. And he, being the spotless lamb who was tempted in all points such as we but without sin and who, being reviled reviled not again, gave himself to be nailed and crucified on the cross and bore our sins on a tree. For without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. Scarcely would a man give his life for a just man and perhaps some may even give their life for a good man. But God, commended his love toward us all, that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for the ungodly.  These things I say unto you all that you may have your hope in Jesus Christ, the light of the world, of whom any that shall walk with him shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. But not just to believe the truth that I have presented unto you, but also that you may receive the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth. That is by the gospel of Jesus Christ. Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. You must be turn from the vomit you’ve grown used to inhaling and you must be washed from the mire you’ve wallowed in. Therefore I say unto you all, Repent from your sins, start obeying God, of whom is life eternal, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This is the plan of God to save his lost sheep who are still bound by sin and in darkness. Blessed are they who receive the call of God this day for today is the day of salvation and many are called but there be few that are chosen. Answer the call if you receive the love of the truth for the choice of your final destination is yours.

futuristic elegance
They are the best out. Real talent. They should be much bigger than they are.

I think youtube should delete the dislike the button
god that was beautiful
I love how their sex appeals are different but they balance one another. One is more aggressive  and sexy more in your face and the other sultry and sensual and sweetly reserved. Loved watching the grow
Yeah they should've been in the main show 😞
Pure perfection!!! I can't stop watching this. 😭😭😭😭
This album is fire!!!  Every performance is incredible!

The fact they weren’t on the main show... criminal
Eu estou impactado com a perfeiçao <3
Keep your freedom and rights, vote dems out. 2Q2Q
The fact that they didn’t win “Best Quarantine Performance” is RIDICULOUS.

16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18
this song is so beautiful
Demon time, ungodly hour now what's next... Freaking in hell.... :/
Ya'll worried about the song and their ranges, and missing the point, These two are witches in training.  They're telling you literally we are in the last days.  and The Ungodly hour is coming.  The Most High is on the way  lol
At 2:23 - 2:33 further solidifies why Halle was the undisputed choice for Ariel.
All Friends  please support me ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

Bruh!!! Diana Ross face, buttery vocals, Sasha Fierce Sweet Dreams looks. Stop playing with the girls, they have ate every performance this year! There’s no comparison!
Omg i love it
THIS WAS MAIN STAGE PERFORMANCE, MIND BLOWN
Goddesses! 🧚🏾‍♀️🧚🏾‍♀️🌌 Periodt
the talent is just UNREAL
My god these girl are so cool
The quality, just like an offical music video
They should have won every vma they were nominated for. It's really upsetting knowing they didn't and can we please stop putting them in these pre shows and put them on the main stage it's so annoying like they performed for the grammys, and on Beyonce tour
They ATE that ish UP!!! They are so freaking underrated!!! Ugh 😩
Not ready
I was wondering how they were going to ascend past Do it. Well here is my answer. Love it!
Halle has the better voice but is more chill. Chloe has a good voice too but always has more energy.
Where's the closed captioning for the Deaf audience? Please add it and thank you.
Una hermosa canción con perfecta sincronía y baile 😘😘
Damn did I just watch Beyonce and the better version of Michelle? OMG I loved it. Khloe is gonna be the next Beyonce for sure
quem deu deslike nessa performance perfeita é corno
A PERFEIÇÃO !! MUITO AMOR 💙💙💙💙
Why they kill me like this huh I was not READY
Yes, that performance was DOPE! 🔥🔥🔥
everybody stuck at Do it but this is where its at 💯
Totally remind me of 702
I could listen to them vocalize for ten hours straight
GIRLIES yOU BOTH SERVED I WILL BE STANNING FROM NOW ON
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🇧🇷
Main show worthy!!!! Shame on MTV.
We should have seen this AMAZING performance on the VMAs IDC!!
LOVE it ~~~~~ !!
They deserve so much more recognition like come on beyonce signed them and they're extremely talented
They are beyond !
I love them. They are just so good. Real RnB.
EPIC!!!!!!
Um wow 😳. Breathtaking 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽!
Queens ❤️
I love when Halle sings "love me" that melts my heart awww 💖 so pure
They are soo beautiful and they never fail to serve!! 😍❤️
These young women can really sing and perform! I can't wait to hear Halle in The Little Mermaid...I love the way she sings!
This my favorite song on the album!
Jeez everyone's been singing about the same crap for so long. Polished turd society.
That beginnnnning though...
Perfect
everything was  Great with this performance, but  the chorus  .... it seemed they were very out of tune :/
the fact that they had one of the more simpler stages but was so memorable really shows how talented they are 😭😭💖✨
Living legendary
STOP PLAYING THESE BEAUTIFUL BLACK QUEENS FACES THEY ARE ON POINT EVERY PERFORMANCE AND REFUSE TO ACCEPT NOTHING LESS. CHOLE x HALLE ARE IT PERRRRRRRIOD!!
Wow  ..never knew they would turn out singing this type of fuckery ...way to go queen witch bey
These girls 🔥🔥🔥
Ellas son arte puro! 💕
I dig this. I like them musically they kill it but my 90s baby heart is super bitter one of them will be Ariel 😞
This is TOO good for me to handle.
Beyonce need to leave these girls alone. She about to turn them into some demonic goddess idols.. girls the glitz and glamor is not worth losing your soul. Get out while u can...
Let's improve videos
😍
I can’t stop watching this and i’m not ashamed
My gosh... black goddesses. There style flavor is immaculate
😍😍😍 They showed out!!!
Someone get these young women real clothes.
They are very creative❤they don't need nobody's stage to be awesome... they are awesome in their very own home!
I see Beyonce all in them. 😍😍
Didn’t know Ungodly Hour was getting a performance so soon. I’m seriously crying, thank you girls
Black girls rock❤ we rock
90s feel first time hearing this group I love it
I love how they feeling themselves
A melhor da noite 😍
The VOCALS THE range THE TALENT The PERFORMANCE 😭❤️
Perfeitassss
I. Have. No. Choice. But. To. Stan!! 😭
You girls never cease to amaze. Well done!
This should be number 1 on trending these girls are so classy and absolutely talented. But instead they aint bc they aint rachet and twerking. Dont get me wrong i like to dance but these girls are Singers thats what its about.
Their outfits remind of sweetdream music video
💩💩
I love the  girl on the left
Wow the sound
Legendary
ARTISTS OF THE YEAR.
I’m still surprised this song is not a single like wtffff it’s a banger a bop a vibe the vocals + the disclosure production it’s just amazing seriously top 2 song of the year and it ain’t number 2
I don't know how I feel about this demon hour lingo. Maybe it's industry slang.
These ladies are Always delivering perfect performances. They deseved to perform in the VMA, not in the pre show
This was main stage material... you failed at putting these girls on the pre-show, but we know you were afraid of them outperforming the others. AND THEY DID!!!
I’m obsessed with this Video, and this song🔥
definitely one of the best performances of the night
Highlight of the Show and technically you weren't in the show. You girls showed up and showed out🔥🔥🔥🔥
maravilhosas sempre!!!!
HALLEEEE and these vocals and these runs. babbyyy
Chloe is the best and she is so beautiful
Elas são perfeitas 🇧🇷🇧🇷💖💖💖💖
dammmmmnmmmmnnnnnnnnnnn
Best of the night
So beautiful and so talented- Smoothie vocalists
Days of noah
Um first off I almost broke my finger hitting replay. They sounded, looked and moved fabulously🦋 [Edit: The note at "Love me" 2:23, and when big sis came through at 2:32 gave me chillsss].
To be honest I don’t know who these girls are I guess I know now....that was an awesome performance 👍👍👍
Unpopular opinion...  I do find that Chloe tends to unintentionally outshine Halle. She seems very powerful as an artist, I can foresee her going solo to be honest. Jus sayin'
Who’s the thicker one? 😍😍😍
They snapp everytime it’s too easy for them ❤️
i got chills all the way through omg they are so talented n beautiful ❤️🥺😭
This year has got the be the greatest one yet for these two, hands down.
Loving the Whitney Houston movie Bodyguard--Queen Of The Night vibes!
The strut tho
❤️
That was STUNNING. BEAUTIFUL. AND MTV, if y'all left this out... You missed a chance. Shame.
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PERFORMANCE HANDS DOWN, YALL ATE ON GOD
OH. MY. GOD.
They sound nice but their performance is not good. Those dances are played out. Who wants to watch two little girls grind the air? No thank u
minimaxes speechwriters
Love this !!! Absolutely gorgeous. They look like melanated superheroes.
I’m so happy y’all preformed this!!! Your voices are so incredible 💕
THEY SLAYYYYYYEEDDD!! Every single time I’m left impressed! Vocals, Body, Face... SERVED! I rarely save videos.. this was automatically sent to the faves!!
Its the 2:05  strut for me
Welcome to the new whores for the rap culture
Beyoncee wanna be
Loop
I am in love with these girls They have different and aestethic style
There’s NO *newly broken* act giving this much thought, energy, or artistry as consistently as Chloe X Halle
Halle is dangerous.  She'll have a dude fall for her instantly.
These girls are impeccable!! Excellent!!
They did that
Can we get a 2 thumbs up option? 😍 #kiltit

So so proud! THEE HOTTEST young singers out right now
https://youtu.be/2ErFN07DS8g
They better give the role of Tiana to chloe 😍😍🤩
how did they not win anything???? Best quarantine performers!!!
What am I even supposed to do with myself now that I know this exists? I am dumbfounded, honestly. This is fucking GOLD
How dare they not have this on the main show!?  This is EVERYTHING!! 😍♥️
People do not see chloe's star power  shes a whole package.
🔥😍🔥 #ChloeXHalle #YouGoGurls
Chloe after the 2:30 minute mark is a god send....SIS WENT AWWFF!!!
This is pure talent 🔥🔥🔥
The angles. The vocals. The lewks. The pitch. The bass. The lights. The moves.
Arrepiei até os pelo do toba, MARAVILHOSAAAS
Love this
2:22 Halle singing gave me chills
MARAVILHOSAAAASSS 😍
Sorry beautiful voices but this song is just corny...they need better material
I'm sorry! There's only so much more of this I can handle! Ya'll gon have to pay my hospital bill. I haven't gotten halfway in the video and I restarted, or pressed rewind at least 10xs.
Their voices got me hypnotized 🤩
The saddest thing is know that they're probably not going to be nominated for album of the year... Ungodly Hour is a MASTERPIECE!
their time is coming
queens
Meu Deus que perfeição
Loveeeeeee❤️❤️❤️
Love everything about these young ladies!!!!
The world is yours, girls! Amazing performance after amazing performance.
They sound like goddesses
I mean Chloe’s body 😩😩😻😻😻
My girls 😩
This gives me goosebumps. I absolutely cannot believe how amazingly talented they are!!!
Goddesses
Im loving these girls baaaaaad. Yaaaaaas next generation is finaly showing us.c❤❤
Killing it
Omg! They performed it!!!! Finally!
It’s the “loveeeee me, love me love me love me love me” part that takes me out.
🖕
Killed this, ladies! 😍😍😍
We are witnessing history they are amazing and I guarantee you they’re gonna go so far
Ungodly Hour?
They can do no wrong in my eyes
The way Halle falls out of call my name @ 0203 is crazy!!!!!! Completely melted my 💙
Why weren't they there??
giving me Aaliyah Queen of the Damned vibesssss
When Halle looks into the camera 😍🙌🏾
MEUS DEUS SÃO AS PATROAS 💕🇧🇷
🖤💃🏿
The talent, the instrumental, the vocals runs... I’m SHOOK 😩😍
This is so beautiful 😍
THEY DIDNT HAVE TO GO THIS HARD. This is what delivering looks like. I AM ALIVEEEE
i love everyone so much. i just don’t understand why females in the western music industry specially need to wear clothes like this. it’s fine if they want to, but what if they don’t? it kinda seems like it’s either you do this or your label will literally kick you out. literally every single female who has performed is wearing the same thing.  i’m sorry, i’m not saying they shouldn’t, i’m saying they should have the option. like i remember ariana grande when she first debuted with her cutesy outfits and long skirts that expressed her personality. then woah, completely transformed her into something they want. girls, is this really freedom? why don’t men do this? why aren’t men wearing things like this and calling it freedom? i feel like we’re brainwashed to think by doing this we’re liberating ourselves but it’s actually the complete opposite. we’re just listening to what they say. that’s not freedom. i love the baileys to death, i just don’t want them to lose their authenticity just for the sake of “making it” in the industry.
PQP BELISSIMAS! Nunca vou perdoar a MTV por colocarem elas no Pré-show. Olha essa performance, era pra ser uma das principais.
GOOSEBUMPS! GOOSEBUMPS! GOOSEBUMPS! GOOSEBUMPS ALL THE WAY THROUGH! CAN WE TALK ABOUT THOSE OUTFITS! CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE FUCKING ADLIBS! THE RANGE! WE DO NOT DESERVE THEM!
These girls are legends in the making!!!
That one time a performance makes you run to listen to the track
They were the most! Everytime they proform it's a show! It's sad that they r constantly over looked even tho they did better then everyone!!
I love these girls🥰
I need Covid to be over so I can go to their concert! Just amazing!
They should perform "forgive me". I can imagine how magical it would be
two angels
I love these two!!! They are distinctively different vocally but both are great singers. One is more sensual and soft the other one more aggressive and sexy. I love the combo!
Halle is perfection.
They seem underrated to me because i just heard about such talented beautiful girls this month when i got a recommendation on YouTube from class of 2020 and i was like wtf. Why are people sleeping on such talented women. Now i stream their songs together with BTS on YouTube and spotify
YALL KILLED IT OMG!!!!
I loooove them, but sometimes chloe does too much. Like it feels forced with her dancing, while Halle moves more effortlessly. Idk maybe chloe is tryna standout more now because Halle is about to blow up more and get more attention once the little mermaid movie comes out. Both voices are beautiful
THE VMAS DIDN’T DESERVE THEM
Ugh the effortlessness of their vocals as they manage to dance perfectly in sync and serve from all angles, truly deserves a chefs kiss
Love these beautiful Queens
So Underrated ! like have you seen them on grown ish and also there vocals 🔥🔥
VMAs needed them
노랴도 좋구 분위기도 좋은데 코디가 조금 아쉬워 저렇게 반짝 반짝 거리고 머리 장신구 반짝 거리는거도 좋은데 좀 언니들의 매력을 끌어당길 수 있는 옷이 있을거 같은데 아쉬버 ㅜㅜ 노래는 정말정말 끝내줘
I love them !!
can we appreciate that they didn’t perform do it
AMAZING!!! So freakin talented...idk if anybody has been payin attention, but every single "quarantine" perfomance these women have outdone themselves time and time again
They made my favorite song better. Only these ladies can outdo themselves like this!! 👏👏👏👏👍💛👍
I love their aesthetic. Chloe x Halle can do no wrong in my eyes right now.
The only vocals of the night you can say  without a doubt weren't lip sync!
Wtf no
Congratulation @mtv for PLAYING YO’SELVES by putting them in the pre-show. They killed this performance. But what else do we expect from you all (still little diversity in executive positions I see - ps, BET don’t count😒). Anyway, CONGRATS to Chloe and Halle!!!! Keep slaying. This is my favorite song on the album. 🙅🏽‍♂️❤️✊🏽
OMG! I am used to Chloe's AWESOMENESS, BUT HALLE IS HYPNOTIC IN THIS PERFORMANCE. They RULE the world!
the way they using our people....smh ungodly hr huh.
JUST PURE TALENT!!!! PRE-SHOW WITH THIS PERFORMANCE??? MAIN STAGE ONLY!!!! 👏👏👏
My girls gone take over everything! It’s like looking at two Beyoncé’s... Not that they are trying to be her, but their WORK ETHIC when it comes to these performances and VOCAL.
QUENNS
The best performance of the night. ❤️❤️❤️
Bro I don’t even have words to describe how special they are, my God. They are so needed in these days Fr. God Bless the heck out of them
This is video music clip ...epic
This has got to be their best performance forget vma GET THEM A GRAMMY
If they record a live album it will sound better than your faves
PATROAS EU AS AMO MUITOOOOI
Just yes to everything 👏🔥
I have the audacity to be a homosexual while women like this exist
They never ever disappoint
Woww, que chicas tan talentosas y sexys ! Deam bitch
what did we do to deserve these two
The vocals! The moves!
too much talent for me to handle
These two are in an elite league of their own. They are untouchable.
I dont know why butthe song title reminded me of Howard's mom in Big Bang Theory
I’m beyond proud of these young ladies!!!! I remember watching your YouTube videos when I was in college now look at y’all!!!! I’m so proud of you two!!!!!!
People needs to stop disrespect those two talented black women ! They delivered as usual 😍
I was smiling the whole time bruh!!! They step on hoes' necks! Chloe's energy was EVERYTHING! How dare they put this in the preshow! I love these ladies so much💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
I didn't know them, but after watching this they totally deserved to be the main thing. They're really good.
It’s Chloe and Halle needing to release an Ungodly Hour Live Deluxe version
I see they got hailey together...cuz baby girl is serving yass go awfff yall
I didn't like this performance.  Way to much Beyonce, like I've seen it  before.
They performed very well but I just these girls are so boring to me idk y
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Loving this vibe! ❤❤❤❤
They are so damn good!!
You ladies always put on a great show & this was no exception! Great job ladies!!
They so fly
a probabilidade de verem isso é de menos de 0,1% ainda mais estando em português, mas mesmo assim vou dizer: PQP PERFEITAS CARALHO
LOVED THIS
Welp, they did that. 🙋🏾‍♀️
Never disappoints!! Looks, runs, energy 😍😍😍
chloe x halle: ✨✨✨                                                me: 👁👄👁
So so so underrated. People are missing out.
The only saving grace of these fake award ceremonies
They didn’t want to show REALNESS
Omg they killed this performance💜💜💜💜
Why can't I like multiple times. They are my whole 20's fuck theme of the year
Beautiful and consistent
my girls deserve so much more!
They make me happy! Straight smiles when I see them
Maravilhosas!!! 🤩😍🥰
Yesssssss! They can never do no wrong! Simply put, I love them!💕💕💕💕💕💕
Yess girlsss love yall!!😍😍😍😍❤🥰
The beat is straight from the 90s. "If you love me" from Brownstone.
Def only pre show worthy they cringe af
Vocês tem as melhores performances da Quarentena. Vocês são geniais e não importa oq a MTV fala
Yass Girls! 🔥🔥
They’re both amazingly talented. Can’t stop looking at Halle and admiring her angelic voice 😍 Can’t wait to hear her as The Little Mermaid!
MAMPUS
Can someone listen to this wonderful girls and not scream: PERFECTION!!!!?? Because I scream PERFECTION!!!
THEY DESERVE MORE RECOGNITION. I SAID WHAT I SAID 💖
They didnt even need background dancers! Don’t you love it when women
Chloe’s energy and sass gave me so much life. She was jamming!
THEIR MIC IS ON.
my GOD, each time i watch any of their performances i am just GOBSMACKED, THIS IS PURE RAW TALENT
They give their all in everything they put out. And this is why I love them so much!
It’s the consistency for me!! The girls don’t miss!
I looked at them and shouted: BEYONCE'S DAUGHTERS!!!
Every performance is getting better and better from this Magical sister duo 😍😍🤯✨
Excuse me Chloe x Halle I’m going to let y’all finish but, everyone else favs could NEVA!! 🖤🖤
This the one
The love me love me part reminds me of a mermaid singing ! And then I remember she is going to be the little mermaid !!
Very good Chloe and Halle
They’re going to quickly learn not to perform on these sub-par stages such as The VMAs for their little “Pre-Show”...these women are headliners...do ya hear me‼️
AMAZING GIRLS ❤
Lawd!!! They stay snatching wigs chile! One of my favs from the album!! 🔥🔥🔥
Fantastic one :D I'm so proud <3
Chloe tryna out do her sis n be Beyoncé.. Halle was more fitting for this song kept it classy n subtle
That's music ❤️, I love it , keep doing good things like that .
loveeeee this❗️🤍😻
I love how they switched keys Halle went lower and Chloe went higher and sit in it comfortably ✨💜✨ talent ✨✨
A masterpiece!!!!!!!
What an amazing performance!!! There performance what better than everyone else 🙂
Woooooooooow🤘🏾
I just love them so much ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Perfeição ♥️
I love that their energies are very different and each is so strong in their own way and the are able to exist in the same space without it feeling like a competition ❤beautiful, lovely amazing❤
EAT!!!!!! They absolutely destroyed this performance. This is my favorite song from the album and they just took it to the next level!!!!
2:30 why is no one talking about that run Chloe gives us?? CHILLS
The fact that I can only like this once is disrespectful 😭😭😂😂❤️
HOW IS THIS LIVE 😍😍😍😍😍
🔥🔥🔥🔥
the talent, there! the looks, there! everything about this is just so great oh my-
Can’t do no wrong 😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
serviram demais
so very talented
such a amazing performance.
None of the other girlies are touching y’all. It’s simple, icons only💕.
I’ve been waiting for this ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
2:23 - 2:37 those vocals are pore raising!
These girls are a complete VIBE I really like their album but these live performances are the SHIT! They’re perfect! Why is Chloe so damn thick! Sheesh Sis is a goddess!
They don't miss. The vocals, choreography, styling. They are incredible.
You cant perform something named “ungodly hour” with a cross around your neck. That is just plain disrespectful to christ.
These girls amaze me everytime! They are so fucking good and their performances are a visual perfection!🔥🔥
Their outfits give me a Beyoncé sweet dreams feel 😍😍
They be killing it! OMG! NOBODIES fking with them!

LOVE U CHLOE×HALLE :(
Chloe and Halle deserve nothing but the best! truly! very talented and such a breath of fresh air with a taste of nostalgia! <3
Our future queens PERIOD
This is beautiful but PRE-SHOW!
They're like a 2 member 702.
Love this song from the first listen... to have a visual made my day.
EVERYTHING!!! 🖤
VMAs.. count your days.. they’re not pre show talent. They ARE the show. I’m irritated
Best song in the whole album !!!!
Best performance Periodt
Shiiiiiit this was HOT!that hip action at the beginning and then the vocals!!  Just Wow! Chloe makes me question my own sexuality
Charisma, incredible voices, great stage presence, what a perfect performance ... they deserve much more recognition. Brazil is watching you. <3 <3
🤛🏿🤛🏿🤛🏿♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
I could listen to just Halle singing “love me, love me, love me” all on its own and be perfectly satisfied for hours 🥵😍
ATE THIS UP!
GIVE THEM THEIR THINGS
Bless your little souls... stay woke.
Who is doing it like the girls?
Each performance is so unique, because they play around with the harmonies and production. The stomping beat after the first chorus did it for me! TALENT
The fact that they did my favorite one from the album!!! I have to stan even more that I did before!!! ⭐ If they don't get nominated for a Grammy, then we have a problem...
I mean....... THEY DID THAT. What more is there to say!!
perfect
They are just stunning so graceful, and always serving looks 🥰🥰
😭🤩💗💗🎊🎊🎊🎊🎉🎉🎉!!!!!
Yay my favorite song 🎵 💕 on the album. 😍🥰
Watch in x2 playback speed
Can we talk about this, I think of all the performances, this is the best performance, the costumes, the lighting, the presentation, and of course the music and the song.
Amazing performance!!
They kill every performance.
Incredible performance!! 🔥
I just recently starter listening to their music but these 2 are super vocally talented, I love their range. Definitely should have been on the main show.
It's Good !!!!!!!!!!! Xo #love
YAAAAASSSSSSSSSSS!!❤
Hey Precious Chloe× Halle!!!! It makes me feel so Happy and Joyful 2 See👁👁All of Your Blissful Performances!!!!  Your beautiful voices Sent From Heaven!!!!💜❤❤💜
LOVE Y’ALL! Great job. 🎶🔥🔥🎶✨
How old are these girls 🤦🏾‍♂️ why are they doing this kind of music..now don't get me wrong I like the song but  young people are not checking for this type of music🤷🏾‍♂️
Sex robots..........SHAME......
I LOVE watching them winning. So proud of these young ladies. 😊
Sounds like beyonce too much
Those moves are godly on sync 😲
Elas arrasaram, nunca deixaram nada a desejar. São monstros!!! Simplesmente perfeitas e esse evento sempre foi ridículo, mas colocá-las no pré-show foi o cúmulo
90's vives
stream this so much it gets the million billion trillion clicks it deserves!!!!
This performance was everything I needed and more!!! This should’ve been in the main show kmt 😩🙄🙄
I love you Girls, you are big stars
I’m sorry but nobody... NOBODY is doing it like these girls. They don’t set the bar... THEY ARE THE FRIGGIN BAR!
These fits get me EVERY time!! 😍😍🥰
Quienes son los ATREVIDOS QUE SE ATREVEN A PONERLE EL DEDO PARA ABAJO !!!! NO HAY MÚSICA MÁS HERMOSA Y SENSUAL
Real artists like these girls didn't perform at the real show and shit like Maluna did. This is a joke.
Dope!
These 2 are getting to Beyonce level.
YEEEEES
I'm enchanted
Canta pra caralho, impecável
OMGGGGGGGG
Is it just me or I could hear 10 voices singing These girls are just too good! We don't deserve them at all
5am got me in bed dancin! I am so proud of them just flawless!!!!!
They can do much better  Fighting 💪
If I would have known Chloe and Halle were performing I would of had a reason to watch the vmas!
They are being groomed to be the next beyonce
SICKENING! 💣
🔥🔥🔥❤
Their best performance yet
Have yet to miss.
THIS IS IT BAYBHIEE
We need a live version of ungodly hour period
🇧🇷🐝❤❤
Warms my heart when I can remember two little girls sitting at home in front of the camera singing Beyoncé song "The Best I've Never Had". Now, two queens are taking shape before my eyes.
Y’all are so fly 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
If I hear again that Halle is not fit to be Ariel... I would slap the person through my phone!! I mean she literally looks like a mermaid from head to toe and with that voice, goshh I wish I could be ursula and steal it😪
I am officially a fan after one viewing. They just put Reynolds wrap out of business in less than 4 minutes ! 🔥😂
Goddesses! They will sweep the Grammys I declare it!
Gagging
You ladies give me goosebumps EVERYtime!!!!😭❤️❤️❤️
Award show performance or music video!? This was so awesome! Outfits and performance were both LIT!!! 💯💯💥💥💥
Choreography is everything
When us older generation is used to seeing performances like this back in the day. Finally we have something to smile about and say real R&b and sistas that can really sing and perform.
Wow wow wow. I've seen you guys as kids singing covers transform to this. I'm actually blown away. And so proud.
These women!!!!!!!!!! Omg the talent!!!!
😱😱😱😱❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😍😍😍
They literally just bought me to an ungodly hour. This is more the amazing
Love this sooo beautiful and sooo talented

This is my favorite song from the album.. so when I saw this performance... 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn! These queens giving us visuals and TALENT! 🤩

Chloe is turning into such a great Performer!!!
Seriously American music awards just hate girl groups.. How can this performance be at pre-award show when they did 100x better then the male artists on main show?!?
What are they wearing? They're stunning
Chloe is soooo thick my goodness 😩
Best perfomance of the night.
Real to the love are have too peace nice joy thanks one love

MTV doesn't deserve Chloe x Halle; they're way too good for MTV
Always better on live
I love to see black peoples win period! But I have yet to get into these two...
Honestly this is all I neeed I don’t even need the VMAs just them. This was absolutely flawlessssss can’t stop watching lol

OMG AAAAAAA I CAN'T WITH THIS GIRLS! THEY ARE EVERYTHING!!!
Eargasm !
They are defo sampling leana
This melody reminds me of the demo tune of the old Casio keyboards!!
Watch this up and comer "Extra amortering"
I like how Halle doesn't force it. She moves like a package with fragile written on it. 🥰
Wow 🤩this song is really good❤️❤️😍😍
I'd love to see them do a song with Nicki Minaj
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

That lil shoulder bop that Halle Gives @ 1:56!! Get it girls!!!
sensual, celestial goddesses
THIS IS SO GOOD! Better than a videoclip!
Really.....they didn't even scoop any award😭😭. This is just so sad and making it even worse they weren't put in the main stage
I've no clue who these talented women are but within 5sec of this video starting I know they shouldn't have been in pre-show. I don't remember the last time I saw something this amazing..
Every performance just amazes me 💯🔥🔥
Who ever disliked this imma find you at an ungodly hour.
GOOSEBUMPS
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
every once in a while, seriously, I wish there was a 'double like' option. truly. i know it would get abused, but those who produce work like this really deserve to know they went above and beyond. js.
They are soooooo polished it’s scary... but I love it
Omg they just blow my mind everytime
They are real goddesses
They are so good i feel like they have time traveled to our erea but really they are from future
Chloe X Halle are overwhelmingly talented the world needs to catch up with these queens I never watch mtv anything I knew they would rob real talent

Oh Chloe, I know that young man is somewhere eating his heart out for losing you. These ladies nailed it.
My ears have been blessed
Deusas maravilhosas que mereciam o prêmio de melhor R&B

I was staring to worry with Beyonce aging and Whitney Houston and another great voices dying that we wouldn't have greats the likes  o them anymore... I can rest easier now
Wow! Our babies done grow'd up! 🤩🤩
They should have won best quarantine performance
They are Fucking insane...🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 Goosebumps 🙏🏼

Such a superb performance with wonderful live vocals
If Ryan Destiny and Normani would get under beyonce's wing I feel they would be on the same level as chloe x halle
Listened to this 4 times in 3 hours lol love them!
The most classy performance out of all them.
IM LIVINGGGGGGGGH!!!!!

MTV really did play themselves by not letting them perform in the main show.
Wow and wow 😍😍😍

I love how these two have grown into beautiful amazing Queens that make amazing music.
MTV!! Yall screwed up not having them on main stage!!

Their outfits are always on point.
Incríveis!
Elas são magníficas!
THEY REALLY DID THAT ✨✨✨✨✨
GODDESSES!!! 😢😢😢
Geez It just keeps getting better.
😱😱😱🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽😁😁😁👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
We need a mv for this song pls 🥺
Chloe FEELS that she is BEYONCÉ   I’m about to agree.... These young ladies are spectacular✨
These ladies are on a totally different planet !!! 🔥♥️👏🏾
MTV .. u should be ashamed..... stop sleeping  on Chloex Halle ... They are killing  it
🙌🙌🙌 ANGELS ARE REAL
Idk how you guys can decide whom to keep your eyes on because they both have my attention,my edges my whole being . This wassssss iiiiiittttttttttttr 😍😍😍😍😍
These young woman NEVER Disappoint!!! 💃🏾

Best VMAs performance 💕💕😍
This is pure fire! They are so entrancing to watch, I wish I had more eyes!!
These women are angels🥰
They’re too powerful
I feel like a proud auntie or something but Im only 1-2 years older than them lmao
Chloexhalle set the trend and the rest follow🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They killed those runs!! I think they need more credit for how incredible they are. I love Chloe x Halle soo much!
Why every body moving like robots and aliens??
They just keep showing out
I LOVEEEEEE!!!
Halle had me gone at  "love me, love me love me, love me, love me" 😪
I want their entire wardrobe
ENTREGARAM TUDO!! VCS SÃO AS PATROAS PARABÉNS POR SEREM TÃO PERFEITAS E EXISTIREM
Yas Beyonce girls!!! Can't u tell how they slay
Its the classic voices for me! Beautiful sound!
No one is bringing up how dope and original the lyrics are.  Speak to me.  “When you don’t have to think about it”. And can we say how Disclosure CRUSHED the production?! They need to do more R&B songs.
They... Ate.. That.. Allllll the way up biccchhhh
its the outfits for me.
THEY RE TRENDING ON TWITTER AGAIN‼️ FINNALLY GETTING THE ATTTENTION THEY DESERVE😌
just remember guys, ariana used to be in the pre-shows in 2013 before she blew up in the mainstream media... the world isn’t ready for them yet but their time will come and we can look back at this time when they were smaller and be so proud at how far they’ve come 🖤🖤
This is Ariels group huh? Shes gonna killllll as Ariel cant wait to see 🙌🏼 wish they sang more pop sounding songs cus this isnt my taste but they sing great 👍🏼
I 🤎 diz whole thing sooo much. da choreo, da outfits, da visuals & da vocals. they're sooo authentic. I see Janet Jackson in Chloe & Beyonce in Halle when they were sooo young. 🔥👏🏽🙌🏽#BlackGirlMagic
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love this song
i really do try to concentrate on the great music they make, but big sister...wow.
all other artists are cancelled , we only know queens chloe and halle
These ladies keep raising the bar! Every performance I’ve seen by them for this new era has been totally different from the last & keeps raising the bar! Wow! Also, when it comes time for the Beyoncé tribute, Chloe is the only performer out that can capture the unique Beyoncé essence! It’s so apparent that Bey has been mentoring them & doing it well!
I have watched this performance 20x back to back! These babies are NOTHING short or MIRACULOUS!!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
THEY ARE SO EFFING UNDERRATED!!!! 😭😭😭💕💕💕💕💕 I love y’all!!!
I’m crying 😭 these girls are gifts!!!! Ughhhh I can’t to see them live one day 🥳!!!
Chloe is tooo damn thick, the camera is always on her body
this might as well be the official video it was perfect!!!!!
only thing I didn't like about this that it ended. another perfect performance from the queens!!!!
Yeeeees looking like they came from another planet, cus they are out of this world
Amazing, every time they snatch my  wig
BGM. 👏🏽
Chloe x Halle: The Siren and the Supreme
again, one of beyonce's best decisions in life
::faints::
🤩! These visuals! 😍😍😍
I love how Halle act so innocent but keep up those sex moves wit her sis
Love the song! Great performance. 🙌🙌🙌🙌
WAP-Wise Artists Perform Chloe X Halle!!!
ChloeXHalle will always be the best thing about 2020
I'm screaming I can't believe I didn't know about this song!!!!!!
The VMAs are dead to me for snubbing these two from Best Rnb Video for Do It and Best Home Performance... and still had the audacity to not make them main stage performers! They still showed them how to do it👏🏼
You. Should’ve. Won. A. VMA. They snubbed you!
Yes the intergalactic women we needed!!!😍😍😍
Every single quarantine performance I am more and more obsessed
THIS IS RAW TALENT!!! SO AMAZING!!!
My opinion is Halle is more gifted vocally. Chloe might have the better body but he tries too much.
THEY’RE SO COOL!! 🤩🙌🏽😭🔥💫
Halle is so elegant I can’t
Excuse me while I go pick up my jaw!!!!! Perfection....PEEERRRRRFFFFFEEECTION!!!!!!!!!!
had to comment twice, wow i told yall.. there perfomances just going to get better and better beyonce is artist development behind these two!
Yessssssss, go girls. I can see Beyonce giving yall that knowledge yessss
wow they dont miss , my fav new artists
Straight 🔥
wow.
Amazing👏👏🥰🥰
I feel like chloe was trying to out preform Halle and Halle was trying to « catch up »
Quarantine has been doing them right, getting thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.
They put in all this effort just to be put into the pre show 😐 MTV when I see you it's ONSITE
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 always fire 🔥
I pray they never go solo..........
my soul is in pain at how underrated they are
God they are sooooo good 😭😭😭😭😍
Halle’s constant eye contact with the camera is giving me life. Loving the outfits. They remind me of Beyoncé’s Sweet dreams the the head accessories are giving me Joan of Arc. I love them
If this is the preshow... who’s the real show then. That’s what I wanna know coz that performance is everything. Costume, chores, vocals. I loved it all 😍😍
🔥🔥🔥
This girls are superior 🔥🔥🔥
They brought Heaven itself to the VMAs?!?!? SUCH QUEENS 😩♥️
WAIT CUS WHEN THEY STARTED DOING ALL THEM RUNS ON THE SECOND BRIDGE RIGHT BEFORE THE CHORUS I WASNT PREPARED
THE GIRLIES ARE THE MOMENT !!!!
TALK ABOUT STAGE PRESENCE!!! AND THAT CONTROL WHILE DANCIN?!? DHHDJD
Fireeeeeee
Sexy and Talented
2:43 Oh my stars that run was phenomenal! They never seize to amaze me! It was so R&B, so raw yet cooked at the same time. It makes me feel happy! ☺️
My fave song!!!
I am fully gagged.
The fact that their quality raises 347% with each performance. And they started at 100 so
Underrated period.
Wow! Realmente me están encantado mucho estas chicas!

I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE HALLE AS ARIEL.
TOO DOPE!!! aaah bruh!! these two are just too cool.
I refuse to let these women remain underrated in this disgusting industry 🤦🏽‍♂️💁🏽‍♂️🙅🏽‍♂️
VOICES!!!
guys maybe they were in the pre-show for safety precautions. I mean.... even tho they are literally so good singers they are still kids, if you know what i mean....... Even tho the VMAs were secured, you can never be sure
wow, this just made my day :)
❤️🥺

This was so good they both were a amazing but Halle performance in dancing and singing it’s just so effortless Chole was amazing too but Halle just caught my eye in this performance man💕
They put them at the pre-show instead of the actual show which was kinda boring, this is ridiculous and they didn’t deserve that, seriously like this song is a vibe nd the outfits are bomb sooo i wanna know why aren’t they in the show??
Vmas truly dropped the ball not putting them on the main show....ALSO this is everything! This could serve as the official music video!
They sound so GOOD!!!!
Shittt I felt them vocals 😩👑🥺‼️
Damn, this is.... this is Art, with a capital A.
Ever witnessed something so good that you're left in awe waving your hands lost for words?
Las amooooooooo
Tf?!?! This would have been my other highlight from the show. I had to watch so much of the boring ass show just to get to see Doja Cat. Also.... how were these ladies not nominated for at least the award for “Best Video Shot at Home”??? Pretty soon, they will have performed the entire wonderful album. ❤️
<3<3<3<3
I guess it’s a good thing the girls didn’t perform on the main show. They would have embarrassed so many “performers” 😒
This is the kind of music I've been missing.
Hey listen up I’m an army but this wins over the zoom background 😭 Chloe x Halle deserved that R&B award ☹️
It was a dark and stormy night when my wig exploded off through the ceiling! My neighbors have a new wig!!! 😱😱🤯🤯🤯
Amazing vocalist 💃🏽💃🏽🎶💕...
Chloe x Halle i love listening to your music I’m a huge fan
Was their performance not televised cuz I swear I didn’t see this
It's crazy how halle can stay so calm whilst chole be giving tina turner right next to her. This is my fav song on the album.
Love these ladies
Lil Mermaid know she ain’t got no Hips to shake, lol!!!!!!
They slayed 💚🔥💚🔥💚🔥
YESSSSSSSS‼️😍😍😍
I saw this on my tv and was like ayeee I recorded it
this is next level... the others could never
Essa apresentação foi top 5 melhores lives que eu já vi com uma certa facilidade
YESSSSS😌🖤
Trash show...production without audience live but on Zoom..awful.  Good parts -- Keke, Doja, Toyota ad using spanish music artists ....Ariana..  too many suspect directives: "wear your mask, make sure you vote, BLM" ... awful. C&H  sound good , but I see they are changing up their image.
I wonder if there wearing Laurel Dewitt?
Their voices are like Angels  and the 92 dislikers are from MTV
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON THE MAIN STAGE!!!!! They are so amazing!!!! 😩❤️
They just keep putting their foot on these girls necks💀
Love this
... i didn’t know i needed this. Until i saw it. Like this my shit. But yo.
Chloe x Halle are the best thing to happen in 2020! 🅿️
I just watched this 3 times in a row and could watch a million times more these girls are so underrated considering their talent & quality they deserve way more recognition. I honestly couldn't keep my eyes off Halle she is out of the world beautiful ✨ they both are 💕
Entendam vcs são perfeitas
they sex appeal is crazy!!!! Especially Chloe😩
whoever disliked it.... is CRAZY!!!!!
😲😲😲 Im sooo in love with yall!!!
ARE YOU KIDDING ME !! They SERVE EVERY SINGLE TIME PUT SOME RESPECK ON THEIR NAME !
I don't wanna see any Beyonce comparisons because y'all know Chloe has her own individual sound and Halle OMG girl keep showing out! 🤭👀
You never NEVER disappoint in anything you girls do... you deserve the success of the world
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They deserved to be on the main show ☹️
Love u girls ❤️ ! But Halle to me you are everything ! 😍
I love this song since I've been a long time fan of Disclosure, but their voices fit the song so well.
Whoa! Okay I’ve seen it all! Amazingg
Halle shined in this performance for me. She has this understated sensual vibe that is mesmerizing. Both ladies werked though!
Omg they both killed this , vocally , performance wise all of it! 🤭😍
Bruh they kill every live performance they do! ❤❤❤❤
Beyoncé chose them for a reason
são muito perfeitas mesmo af
YESSS AYEE I SEE THEM DANCE MOVESS I SEE YALL!!! I’m gonna memorize them so everytime I listen I’ll be dancin too :) I love every single one of their performances!!
They literally have me drooling bro they're so damn flawless it's crazy😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤤🤤🤣
Their recent album resonated with me so well I’m rooting for them so hardcore now this performance was 🔥🔥🔥🔥
They are slayin in the name. I live for their high notes. Perfect pitch.
Chloe x Halle ❤️ the lord blessed y’all with every angelic voice in heaven and your beauty just amplíes your art 😍 my gosh they are such talented sisters and i can’t get enough of their music !!!
Finally my fav song is performed
Am I the only one getting Beyoncé Sweet Dreams vibes with their outfits😍 absolutely Slayed this performance. MTV sleeping hard💯 should be in the main act.
15,000 likes and only 35 dislikes says EVERYTHING you need to know about these QUEENS!!!! MTV better learn from their mistakes and never make them pre-show again. The talent speaks for itself!!
Fellas... thank me later - 1:15
Swear they need a rapping cousin lol
oh my GOD this is soo goood . im cryinnggg
chills.
Perfeitas 😍😍😍🇧🇷🇧🇷
Best performance of the night easily.
They both should have been nominated in major categories, like, c'mon, look at the material, they are ICONIC, TALENTED, VERSATILE, BEAUTIFUL, CHARISMATIC.
You ate that up!!!!
I been watching them grow before they was signed to Beyoncé. I love them!!!  Beautiful ladies
Yessssss!!
ate this tf UP
I hope all the other artists were taking notes. Cause this was 🔥🔥
Haaaaaaaaaa 🤩 eu estava esperando.....
Chole x Halle = ungodly hour  Beyonce = Demon Time
Mind blown thank you
Biggest talent of this generation
they have BIG Beyoncé energy...i’m not comparing them to Beyoncé but the impact she had on them you can clearly see it...she definitely helped lead them to an amazing legacy...the outfits and coordination superb...they need to hurry up and put that tennis court to work and give us a concert we need it 😩 2020 has been fucking ruthless.
This was hypnotizing ❤️
Okay, I personally loved this VMA performance the most.  I have another favourite indeed, which I loved for its purpose, but Chloe and Halle are phenomenal.
Beautiful, talented, regal, they are EVERYTHING!!!
EU AMO VOCÊS 🤩♥️ QUEENS
A ellas...las amoooooo...
I love these women 🤍🤍🤍🤍
GIVE ME ALL THE RUNSSSS
Dear MTV, See how they ate this? Yeah, next time just put them in the main show.
If they go on the Terrell Show😍😟🤞🏿
This is ridiculous😩🤩🥵
The way they out performed almost every performance  that was on the main show!!!!! PLUS they deserved awards for best quarantine performances❤️❤️
Just perfect
Damn!
best performance from the vmas !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The visuals!!!
Omg this is way beyond awesome than the original track 😍😍😍😍
The song is called Ungodly Hour but damn this performance is GODLY!
20/10 These girls are beyond talented and wish they would have more recognition!
their joint slay... yup!
talent talent and more talent
Goddamn Goddamn!!!
UGH YO chloe's flip from chest to head voice is damn good
Ok sooooo, I guess ima just have to shave my head and throw away my wigs because these girls just be snatching all my hairs every single time they perform.   Can’t. Help. But. Stan.
You're perfect!!!!
QUEENS GODDESSES LEGENDS BEAUTIES
This song reminds me of destiny's child
Beautiful voices. Wonderful harmonies.
Good lord they out did every other performer on the VMA's. Wow, shame on MTV for only putting them on the pre-show. CXH should have been the ending number.
these girls are AMAZING.
They are simply amazing and gorgeous, their outfits their music all of it is perfection
Yo their energies together is just so perfect they literally improve with each performance
Aurgggghhh, Amazinggg✨✨💋
Looking forward to seeing these young queens live in concert!! Vocals and lyrics on their debut album is stellar BUT then they come with these live performances. The live performances are better than the studio album. We need a live version of the album!! True talent!
MTV let Doja Cat perform during the show over this???
I cant wait for real music making to be back in style cause they GOT IT !!!!
Ya'll👏🏽did👏🏽that!!!!!!!!👏🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥💯🤩
Wow
The fact that they didn’t win any awards is upsetting me and my homegirls 😭😭
this is what happens when you sign onto a label ran by a Virgo, and black one at that. Every Move, Every Finger point, betta have a whole three page essay explaining as to why you did such a thing. The Live's are just, BEYOND. Congrats are in order all the way down the individual in charge of the lighting.
These girls are definitely talented...but i have to say their performance style u can tell came from Beyonce... Like her belief in giving a show on top of amazing vocals...thats all Beyoncé. Kids these days don't usually perform with this kind pf professionalism and showmanship this early in their career these days....
I loooooove these baddies yesss
❤️❤️😭😭...I am so sad that y’all didn’t won 😭😭😭😭😭
I’m ready for a virtual tour at this point! Take all of my money!!
I'm just living for this. This is my jam. Omg. Vocals, visuals, choreo. YASSSS CxH
Y’all were the show I only watched because I knew y’all were performing.
Y'all deserved that award
I love how when Chloe gets a ponytail she cuts up! Halle served us a sickening ass vocal and FACE!
Naw forreal they snapped with them vocals🔥🔥🔥
I’m soo glad I saw this performance coz this us perfection! I’ve got goose bumps!!! 😍😍😍
Soooooooooo talented
No because wtf this is something else. Chloe and Halle will save this generation! Wtfffff
DEAR EXISTENTIAL  SHINING BEAUTY BLIND ME!
Muchas gracias por la calidad de su trabajo!  ❤️😭🙌
They are unreal. These live performances blow my mind every time.
“VMAAAAAAS” god i love when Chloe does that.
First time listening to this song and it makes me feel things
Ungodly Hour was already my song, but the look on my face...I didn't know I could go from one stank face to another in succession like that. Face trying to recoup now. Y'all are mad TALENTED and HARDWORKING. My goodness and thank you ladies...
It's the little mermaid and her sister
GIVE them the MAIN STAGE!!!
por deus....
Cantam demais 🥺❤️
Chloe's adlibs hit different
They were better than every other performance tonight...hands down! Now this is talent!❤🔥👏🏽
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
The Beyonce influence is becoming obvious now hey...not that it's a bad thing
So beautiful.
addicted
They're solo good
Affffff
ALWAYS KILLING IT
They SLAYEEEDD! I am so happy for them!!  This rendition is firee I keep replaying it.  Hope they release this song as a single.
Just be vibin at home makin astonishing songs. They Unstoppable
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Amazing👏🏽
The vocals!!!
GOD IS COMING TO DESTROY SATAN AND HIS PEOPLE....SOON
Halle is so silently confident while serving beautiful angelic vocals whiles Chloe is visibly confident whiles transitioning to different ranges when she’s singing 😍 I love how Chloe doesn’t hold back and Halle doesn’t force her self into acting out of character 🥰
A COMPLETE AND UTTER FORCE!!! 😳
You can tell they have so much fun doing these! Especially Chloe😂❤
In short, a serve
Wow 🤩 Just wow!!!
🖤🖤🖤
Soooooo goood!!! 😍
I hope ya'll are tweeting tf outta MTV for this stupid ass move. This is a main show performance dammit!!
🥺🔥🖤
💜 I'm SOOOO IN LOVE 💜
🔥🔥🔥🔥😭😭😭😭👑👑👑✨✨✨✨
Peeeeerrrfeeeect🔥🔥🔥🔥🥵
OH MY GOOOD <3
So sickening 😍😍 they leave me speechless every time they perform live!! #underrated
You two are EVERYTHING IVE EVER WANTED IN AN ARTIST. AMAZING. INCREDIBLE.
THEY DID WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE!!!!!!!!
Me enamore de su presentación, en serio me gustó mucho, tienen mucho pero mucho talento 😍
I’m so happy the younger generation will have these talented, beautiful, hardworking woman to look up to; along with the other great women absolutely destroying the game. I’m so happy to live in this age when generations before us have never witnessed pure excellence from powerful women. As a 90s born gay man, this just gives me hope to keep working on my goals and never stop dreaming.
Outfits 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Y’all betta tic❤️❤️❤️
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💕💕💕💕💕🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟💕💕💕💕💕💕♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
ok but Halle's dancing like she has places to go though wow go head girl
Wow. Just... oh wow..
This was everythiiiinnnggg 😍😍😍😍😍 ugh vocals energy dancing outfits lighting was in 1,000 y’all better GLOW!!
DAMN😍😍😍
They are amazing!!! I saw some Beyoncé in this performance and loved it. I love how hard they work and how they give their all on stage.
So talented in every way much love ❤️
The fact that the VMA's placed this monster talent in the pre-show is one of the reasons I will not support them! These ladies are on point everytime!! They are a true talent and this industry can't even appreciate them.
We have really been blessed by their angelic voices, i was almost moved to tears
Every time they perform a new song it becomes my new favorite 😂😂😂😂
Best performance of the show and before it even started 🤭😂👏🏾🔥
"Ungodly " why 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤨??????????
The way they should have been the main event of the whole VMAs...
Love these girls 😍😍
Chills💓💓💓💓
The talent jumped out 🔥
I hit like before it started because I already knew these girls were going to bring it, and like DAMN! They never disappoint!
First of all they literally get better and better with each performance. They never perform the same song the same way.  Third they constantly out due their albums.
Whatch them a pressure
All things of substance are always put second now a days. And the industry and all these award shows push trash first. SMH. WHITE PEOPLE GET IT TOGETHER!!! You own all these industries. Do Better
Love these Queens!!! They definitely deserve all the spotlight
This is better than the album version! Ya’ll deserved to be on the main show!!! One of the best performers of the night! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Vocês são perfeitas! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
omg!!! This is TOP
they constantly outdo themselves EVERY SINGLE TIME. literally no one is doing it like them. THEY ARE THE MOMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
VISUALS! LOOKS! TALENT!!! THEY HAVE IT ALL
🔥🔥🔥
they ATE this up 😭
Pure Beauty & Talent 👌🏾👸🏾👸🏾
THEY EAT THIS UPPP
You don't have to start performing half naked... your voices are fabulous.
this album literally saved my year.
Halle think she slick taking those sultry glances at the camera. I 👀 you!
아 ungodly hour 라이브라니 ㅠㅠ 개좋아
A heavenly dream!😫👌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 vocals are so in sync!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤗🤗🤗
2:30 you can tell with her voice that she will be an amazing Ariel
C’mon new light!! Best performance of the VMAs, I don’t need to see anybody else’s!!
To the 79 people that disliked this performance......BLESS YALL HEARTS!!!
I love everything in this video 💖💖💖🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
why is that everytime they perform I'm mesmerized
I am just speechless...PERFECT...JUST PERFECT!!
WELP?!?!!? this is my first time listening to them and i must say that i am ashamed that i do not know them...
Chloes higher notes 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Amazing
between their performance and bts' for an hour now 😍😍😍
This song right here... the whole album is platinum but this song is just otherworldly. And this performance? Big. Fucking. Bang.
THIS IS PERFECTION
God is not a woman , WOMEN ARE GODS ⭐️
queens
God I love these live vocals so much
melhor performance da noite e ponto!!!! colocou muitas atrações principais no chinelo
WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
they've come to save 2020
Y'all better work it!!👏👏👏👏
BYE YALL REALLY DIDNT HAVE TO DO THIS TO ME
They should have won!!!
daaaamn 😱
SO MUCH EXCELLENCE THIS VMAS
They got robbed, I'm pissed at the VMAs for not letting them perform on the main show. Also, that Quarantine category belongs to C x H, they outperformed everybody.
They are BAD!!!!! I wish them GREATER sucess!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
They cured my depression and body issues, snatched my wig, ended homophobia, racism and miss rona's career and I now have clear skin 😗👉👈
Mmmmm they sound good. I get what they are saying, but they could have used some thing besides ungodly hour.
Amazing!! ❤️❤️❤️🔥
The flavor 😌✨
one of the best parts of 2020 for me was getting into their music ❤️✨❤️✨❤️✨❤️
They delivered everything girls ⭐❤️
Their range, their choreo, their oozing unapologetic femininity, and their growth is so divine. Love everything they servin💖
Edges: snatched Wig: flewn MTV: gagged and gooped Everyone: laughing at mtv for making the mistake of putting them in the pre-show
You girls are baddd........🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤😊
Da hora!
Omg their voices are ridiculous.  Unlike anything out there now.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥   Now just waiting for the official music video of Ungodly Hour! Thank y’all so much!
That was amazing
Gorgeous, vocally gifted young Queens💕
They movement is so fluid 😩
The sole fact that they wasn’t in the show was disrespectful. They outperformed half the people in the show
I finally realize who they remind me of from the past 90s. They bring me that amazing sound of Zhane. I'm proud of there push and how there continually climbing to the top. May God bless them on there amazing success in there life. They are truly wonderful to hear.
PROPRIETORS of the night!!
They sound like Beyonce they act like a younger version of Beyonce. Great Job Beyonce you truly know real talent.... They have a beautiful voice.
Ohh these girls 🥰🥰🥰they just do it for me 💯🥺♥️✨♥️✨♥️✨✨
Brilliant
So we not gonna talk about that long ash braid chloe has 😍...
Bodied this shi
Killed it again! Their outfits are giving What’s It Gonna Be vibes. Making Busta and Janet proud!
I'm not going with the Beyoncé way Chloe does. it does not have its own personality. Halle is herself
How do they keeping topping EVERY live performance this year? All 2020 they've been in their talent bag and have given us nothing short of memorable live sets, while we are all still in lockdown. If their was ever young talent to "stan" in the industry , they have my vote, hands down, across the board nothing but 10s
Their album is the best thing that has ever happened in 2020! Beyonce did the right thing to be their mentor and signed them under her label. Queen Bey can never be wrong 😍
so you're telling me this wasn't the main event???
THEY ATEEEE
I am officially bald.
I’m ready for they virtually concert on tidal 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
2:36 eargasm 😩👉👈
MY QUEENSSSSS 😭😭😭❤❤❤
They just make my spirirt so HAPPY
I’m sorry but they *OUT PERFORMED* everyone even BTS and I’m an AMRY .... and also they got the preshow MTV *WHAT THE PAHCK MAN* !!!
Why was this part of the Preshow and not one of the main performances????
Am I the only one who notices Chloe wearing a Baphomet headpiece on top of her head? 🤔
Ya know...typically,I would’ve been mad that they were doing this as a “pre-show”,performance.just because we ALL know how those stages only get shown 40 seconds of the performance and cut into a commercial break,or maybe it low budget....but I like since Covid-19 happened,they basically got to create a “music video” for this.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
When she said “VMAS” omg so beautiful 😭😍
My fav song from the album 🥺🥺🥺
🌻❤️👏🏽
THE PRESENCEEEE!!! I can feel the universe with this performance.
You girls are such queens PERIODT!!
Yesss, ladies can we tipsy and wonder what she thinks of me
MTV played tf out themselves by not putting this on the main stage. Straight clownery. Chloe x Halle are fucking insane. Like it actually pisses me off how talented they are. Who gave them the right to slay me like this?
❤🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌❤
Love them- I wish June’s diary had this kind of team behind them.
A+
They’ve delivered more iconic performances on that tennis court during the pandemic than most artists ever will in their whole careers .
Impeccable as always ❤️
2:43 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳👑
As patroa fazem tudo
were in trouble this is the most iconic thing i ever saw🤭💛
I'm  so proud of them, I could cryyy.  Their hard work and talent SINGS volume!!
I have officially been shooketh
Cantam muuuito fácil. Incrível
STAN
They’re the only artist I AVIDLY watch. Most videos I’m okay catching at a later time but every time they drop something I  have to stop whatever I’m watching/doing to see what new amazing thing they’ve put out. Beautiful girls love them so much ❤️
SO SOS O GOOOD.. WAITING FOR TIPSY TO BE PERFORMED NEXT
Sweet mother.... they already knocked it out of the solar system long ago. This is an entirely new planetary system right here.... shit man they’re forming a new galaxy. Where do I sign up to move there 🤯
The album of the year, and just my opinion matters.
Dope
The fact that this wasn't one of the main performances and YET THE QUALITY
serving
I’m so glad they sang this song it’s one of my favorites from the album! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Halle is so mesmerizing it hurts
Amazing!
It's the outfits. Yall stay looking like the boss bitches that yall are
Top Tier Performance!!! 🔥🔥🔥 I would love a virtual concert from the tennis court with multiple outfit changes!
How were they not on the main stage? They sing and perform everyone under the table.
My favourite song in the entire album
CXH AND DOJA TRULY SERVED AND WASHED AND ATE
What a DUO! We see, hear and appreciate the effort you guys put into your craft
THIS DESERVES A BILLION LIKES
blind people dont realise how she has a freakin baphamet on her head wtf is this world coming to
Chloe has been feeling this long pony tail😂
Serviram demais se loco, gratidão por viver na época dessas meninas ❤️
INMACULATE
Murked.
how we say in argentina: QUÉ MUJERES
I'm part of XO all the way but I really gotta say Chloe and Halle definitely without any doubt deserved to win the vma for best R&B with "Do It" I wish they would've won :( but anyways their time hopefully will come and until then imma keep supporting this amazing talented black R&B Queens
meu deus essa performance... simplesmente perfeita!!!
❤️
I love them so much
This is to much i love it 🥵🥵🥵🥵❤❤❤
Son sequisimas me encantan 😍
Reminds me of LaBelle... Sara Dash, Nona Hendrix and of course young Patti with their energy, their vocals and their look. They're amazing!
These babes can do no wrong. They show up, show out and get down EVERY TIME!
Chloe x Halle é minha religião
Bonequinhas lindas
Donas do R&B
obrigado por isso!
NO ONE DOING IT LIKE THEM
SONG OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes yes yes when I tell you these woman right here are so true queens and they have the voices of angles and always put in 110%in every performance and in every note they sing it’s just amazing
Donas da minha vida
I mean damn! They NEVER disappoint!!!!! I dare someone to say these girls aren't talented!
Cristais lapidados
Lindas
Deusas
This performance during the pre-show was much better than most of the performances during the actual VMAs.
LOVE IT!!!
ATE ATE ATE ATE ATE ATE
They had me when they started bopping at 0:09
The outfits, the choreography, the song, the old school mics, the vocals 😍😍😍 absolutely killed it all!!!
listening to this makes me feel like i'm floating. this should have been part of the main show
This whole performance tho. They straight up said oh you wanna put me on the pre show!! I’ll show you true talent. If I was another artist performing I would be mad as hell. They came to let a bitch know they are not to be reckoned with🙌🏾
Literal sirens 😍
🇦🇴🇦🇴🇦🇴🇦🇴🇦🇴
Yasss was waiting on this one too!!!
This is SUPERB ladies! Like omg,how do y’all get 20x better each show!? That hard work is paying off in stacks girls! Y’all are really out here doing it!

They continue to shine as they move to the next level and it is indeed glorious to watch their ascent.  Well done, ladies!
I’m mad they didn’t get to perform on the MAIN STAGE 😤😤
Wow amazing performance,I really admire them 😍💓💓
Every time they say the "heard it all before" lyric it reminds me of John Legend's Everybody Knows
i am asking you: WHO IS DOING IT LIKE THEM. QUICKLY!
How are they not superstars yet?! They blow everyone else out of the water without trying.
I'm not gonna lie this performance gave me chills
why is nobody talking about chloe's hair... are you all seeing what i'm seeing?????
PLEASE I CAN’T TAKE IT😭😭😭💕💕💕💕
Being that i'm from London and now live in ATL... this is peak! disclosure with the track and these two gorgeous diamonds killing it with them flawless vocals
They should have done Do It...

Why are their performances always SOOO *GOOOOODDD* !!! It's not fair on these autotuners how they are killing these performances left, right and centre!!! My poor edges can't take no more of this!!!
Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stoping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, poop on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it. They never fail to DELIVER👑🔥
They're just Extraordinary!  Underappreciated talent.  Everyone needs to know who they are... they are just one of the best voices of all time!
I’m try to fathom the fact on why were these sickening🥵 individuals were on the pre show they should have been on the main stage
1:27 y'all , the moves !😍😍😭
Speechless 💓
their live performances are consistently somehow EVEN BETTER than the album..... like........... how......................
They are one of the best things about 2020
My favourite song in the album !😭😭
DAYYUUUUUMMMMMMMMM THESE TWO QUEENS ARE ON FIRE 🔥🔥🔥
You girls are so amazing , nobody does it like you . Bye !🤐😭😍❤️
The industry  is going to have these two bright young ladies undressing just like the wrist of them female artists I can already see it it's starting to show that they are showing more skin than ever before I promise I hope that doesn't happen for these two young ladies they are too classy for the dumb shit
SEX SALES.......... BUT THEY ARE SO TALENTED. THE DAMN BOMB... BEAUTIFUL... PERIOD!!!!
FINALLY PERFORMED THIS
This is my favorite song off of the album and it just got better✨✨✨perfect performance
This gave me looks, talent, and sexiness all in one package. Chef Kiss
Two of most Creative Sistas In The WORLD!!! 2 X GOATs The Future seem better now! FLASHLIGHT & SPOTLIGHT!
The queens themselves
I love it
NOW YOU CANT TELL ME THERE NOT GOING TO BE LEGENDS LIKE LITERALLY VOCALS ON POINT STAGE PRESENTS ON POINT OUTFITS ON POINT. LIKE WTF CAN YOU SAY.

Perfeitas ! Merecem o mundo ! 🤍
Maravilhosas 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

I’m so impressed. The energy was definitely on 10. The outfits the lights everything was perfect!
i’m being honest. this is the best thing i have ever seen or heard. like ever. i have chills down my whole body. the fact that they’re the preshow is unfathomable... who could follow this??? literally who.
THAT RUN 1:24 BE MAKING BEYONCÉ PROUD FOR SURE
The outfits remind me of Whitney Houston in the movie ‘The Bodyguard’, when she sings Queen of the Night. And I love it ! 🔥
Miss Tennis Court is doing the damn THING
Perfeitas, nunca erraram
Yall better keep doing it!!!!!!
Now that's a hit!... They look like interplanetary princesses. Great look, Great sound, Great job!
Unmatched talent...a gust of fresh air.. 🔥
Their stylists DOES NOT MISS!
VOCAL QUEENS
The music industry has these two poor girls looking like sex robots, I love their voice though it's quite stunning.
I think they should split and have solo careers. The sister with the soprano voice is so unique and I think she’d be better off by herself.
These two have been working harddd this year! 🙌🏾
literally fave on song on the album you girls keep outdoing yourselves.... amazing
make this trending y’all 💗💗
Love everything about this performance🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Yalll did well like always❤️🔥🔥

I love the natural glam pertaining to their makeup. The way their outfits always remain high fashion but functional. Edgy but elegant. It is symbolic of their individuality, the fact that they basically have on the same outfit but styled to fit them personally. Simply Iconic!
This performance was IMMACULATE.
Chloe & Halle makes me forget just how bad 2020 has been. You 2 are so REFRESHING!!!!

Halle is beyonce in destiny's child and Chloe is beyonce now.   Both took that mentoring an made it their own.
The smartest thing Beyonce did was sign them to her label😍
Chloeeeeeeeee

Actually Goddess
great vocal and moves. reminds me of old school girl groups
they look and sound so good
Y'all out here slaughtering the game. Killing them with vocals, performance and looks.  Go head!!!
They hit every beat with the choreography🤯
These young ladies are truly just "NATURALLY TALENTED", they are beautiful, song-writers, actors, intelligent, and effortless dancers & performers. They are young, and already well - experienced entertainers. KEEP IT UP LADIES! YOU ARE BOTH TRULY BLESSED & GIFTED!

This album era they are simply unstoppable. The talent, choreography, fashion, and confidence. Bravo.
the standard has been set once again
The OUTFITS. This is so COOL. <3
Incredible
So nice of them to take the time and come to earth for this performance! Stunning.
FINALLY
The next presentation not knowing what to do after my girls just stole the whole show with just one song: 👁👄👁
i really appreciate how parkwood continuously gives them creative control and a budget to do whatever they want. other record labels need to take note.
They are such a powerful duo there’s no convincing me otherwise 😌
THUS IS WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT  !!
Thank you for feeding us
Queens of quarantine performances
IM CRYING THIS IS THE BEST PERFORMANCE YET
I smile every time
I’m not upset to have been blinded for the rest of my life because this was the last thing I saw.
You songz is very nice i like it
The magical voice😍😍😘😘
I LOVE THESE GIRLS SO MUCH 🥺🤍CHLOE AND HALLE ARE THE BEST
they are such queens literally no words I'm in awe
The world need to catch up quicker  because this is a crime to not know them at this point
YALL👏🏽BETTER👏🏽WORK👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽‼️‼️‼️
You sing nice
THEY ATE THIS SHIT UP!!! LIKE IM STILL IN SHOCK
Yall dont even need a music video for this song, this performance is lightning
I literally can’t with how good this is! AHHH!
just wanna say a quick PHVCK YOU to mtv for putting these girls on the preshow instead of giving them the platform they deserve. this whole album cycle, they've pumped out excellence. given new versions of songs, stunning performances, endless looks, and shown their growth and creativity. they deserve to be given opportunities and platforms that match their talent and work ethic.
im soo early i cant believe dis i love this song so far :D
They're probarly the most consistent rising artist, from vocals to stage presence, outfits be fire too.
Love them 😩🥰
they never do anything wrong or bad, always serving impeccably, proud to be a fan of artists like that, I hope that one day the audience will fall into their arms and it will not be too late because they deserve it all! ❤️❤️❤️🥺🖤
I ALMOST CRIED I LOVE THEM SO MUCH PURE TALENT
We stan the correct girls, talent everywhere
THIS IS ART.
I hear Ariel singinggggg
vocals. outfits. lighting. period.
Yes ,I asked and I recieced😂
I love this performance the thing that kills me is their voices are good enough as it is; there’s no need to lip sync to a pre recorded live track
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just wow!
YESSSSSSES
Oooooo I've been waiting for this one 😎😎😎
nah they slay so much that at this point their lack of recognition from main stream media just highlights the integral issues of main stream media in itself. Their unorthodox excellence and superlative talent speaks volumes loud enough to deafen a thunder storm. PERIODT.
Elas são fodas de +, merecem todo sucesso do mundo
I’ve watched this 4 times In a row they are PURE TALENT and CREATIVITY and SISTERLY PASSION. I CRIED	how dare mtv not make them headliners
yesssssssssssss
The outfits of this era are really something out of this world😭❤️
I didn't know who they are but wow, surely I know now.
LAWDT HAVE MERCY!!!!!!!! YESSS!!!!
This is my  F A V O R I T E song off of the album. I LOVED this. It looked like they gave so much energy but it also looked effortless. Ugh... They're AMAZING. Grammys next year? Because.... whew.
Yesss, I watched it live and you know it’s good when you get the chills on your body!!😂 These women have so much talent I never get tired of their songs! Great job!!!
their oufits look so uncomfortable.
Finally, my song❤️
The vocals with the effects , costumes, choreo and camera work is so damn good like kudos to chloe, halle and their team for giving us this gorgeous performance ❤❤❤
I loved every minute of this performance 💗💗👑👑
This is the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen in my life
Y'all better sing
THEY DESERVED MAIN STAGE 😤 They never disappoint 😭🧡
Sweet dreams vibe but in silver,,,, everybody knows John legend sample?
Wow I love the costumes, choreography, visuals and of course the banging vocals. Absolutely amazing and also loving Chloe’s sexiness and Halle’s sultriness in their performance. Chloe’s is my spirit animal 🔥

I don’t understand how is it that they never miss😭😭❤️❤️
Listen! The truth is right here. Sorry they didn't get more nominations but they are undeniably talented.
All I can say is Expensiive
the fact that it was a preshow performance and they already out performed everybody that got a main stage
there is not a single person in the music industry right now that is putting things out there on this level
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
It always makes me laugh how they start the introduction of their performance with their airy voice: “ VMAS, BET” And these looks are ICONIC! They give me Beyoncé in “Sweet Dreams” Músic Video vibes “TATTOO YOUR NAME ACROSS MY HEART” 🥰
We been waiting on this performance! Yassssss!
ICONIC!
They  so talented ..I Love there  CD...
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMG! I THOUGHT THAT WAS HALLE AT THE END!  GO OFF CHOLE!!!!!!!

Can we just appoint them as the new Queens of R&B already? Lol 🤩🤩
Rainhas!❤️🇧🇷
Halle's stage presence is improving soo well! She's coming out of her shell! So natural. And Chloe is fabulous as usual!😊
How did they snatch my wig and I have locs like them?!
They are so beautiful and dope
They never disappoint!!! 🔥
