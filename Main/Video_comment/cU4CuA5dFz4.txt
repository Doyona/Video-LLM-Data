I want to see more AutoAlex and AllTheGear collabs. Car Throttle died hard when those guys left.
Can tell he's part german
Love the way nearly all the comments are about the 406 😂
Wow that 406 need a good service and throw away the old trans oil and get new filters... maybe re-run the drag race again would be awesome.
had Ethan not been in there, it might have pulled it. they say 100 pounds means 1 tenth in a quarter mile drag time, all else being equal.
Drag race towing trailers  Audi q7 vs g wagon   GET IT DONE
I hate Alex he don’t deserve to be on this channel and I’m glad he isn’t anymore. Jack and Ethan are the best. Alex is trying to be funny but not realising he’s a twat. Let’s have a boxing match Alex. I’ll leave you in a wheelchair. God knows how he’s married. I feel sorry for the poor girl
This G wagon is by far not the 2022 model
damn that 0 to 60 is bad for a car that can do 14 to 15 seconds. i say 16.3 second  quarter mile
Puma and cougars are different cars, but the same animal
comfiest seats of any car i have ever owned
Do some crazy mods on the peouget , and challane a super car to a drag race
Marking this as the first time I've heard "if you don't know what a tape is, google it".
Still with that Scam Omaze as a sponsor? Really guys? Unsubscribing.
you guys should modify the 406 to be fast enough to beat the G wagon without it towing a car
Slept on the c70 like 240 hp 5 cylinder turbo
4:09
Should've had Ethan in the G-Wagon instead. Makes a negligible difference in the total weight (and thus Power-To-Weight ratio) there, but could've been what cost the Peugot the win.
I am biased since I own a V6 406 Coupé (albeit in better condidion than this one) BUT I hope car throttle rips out the interior, gives it a service, better intake and and thrashes it. Makes my car worth more haha (just kidding, noone pays well for Peugeots)
The 406 would probably have pulled it on the last one if they went 1 person per car.
Quickest under a grand?   Nah, I've seen early noughties Volvo S80 T6's at barely over a grand, haggling would get you under and they're 70+ more horsepower and best part of a second to 60 quicker than a 406 coupe despite being heavier.  Still, the 406 coupe is a pretty little thing and has aged well, looks better than the vast majority of current cars... One of the few Pugs I wouldn't mind owning (alongside the obvious 205 1.9gti)
Thats a great donor car for a Ferrari rep. They have the correct roof line a correct engine (if only in the wrong place) :)
Nice one
Great....
This is bary g. It amazing
Good 😊
What a nice car 🚗🚗🚗
Nice video
Love this
who gets an automatic...for a race..
It's very ugly though isn't it
In future, every time Alex says "Shut Up", turn around and smack him in the face.
I think if you stripped the interior of the 406 and spent the rest of the 100 on doing some mods it would have won easily. Keep the 100 budget for the challenger car but do all you can in that budget to make it lighter and faster.
Look how fast that back is 😂😂😂
The last race was close enough to where if Ethan were to sit in the G wagon rather than the Peugeot, it might have won :D
💪
You guys seems to amaze me
Happy for you guys
Why do jack and Ethan always sound like they have plugged up noses?
Where I live g wagons = drug dealer
I want more videos like this
More 406 content please !!!
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A CARWOW EPISODE WITH MATT
It's great too see that Jack still has his Saab 96 I wonder what ever happened too Myles the Skoda Octavia the blue one?
I like the bit when you talked about previus behind scens gone wrong x'D
Could have rented
Please do that again with a drastic weight reduction from the Peugeot. That will be neck and neck a reckon.
Beautiful
Absolutely
Hey
I can't believe how great the used market around them is
Help me carwow
5:51 lmao isnt that the same 330 that BlackPanthaa just bought?
The 406 is nice
Love the 406 coupe, Ferrari Roma on a budget
Interesting
I love my g wagon
🔥
Wow
Nice
3:17 😂❤️
dang that alfa in italy is worth a lot more
So cool
Okayy
I love that
Nice
nice
😎
Loved that epic race.
I like to see more drag races like this Carwo... eh Car Throttle :)
This episode has some red vs blue vibes with the cougar/puma mixup 😂
You should modify the 406 to beat the G wagon!!
Where'd you get that Rallye hoodie? 😳😁👍
I’m not gonna lie it is fun to watch and was excited at the same time as they were 💜keep going you guys are doing great💙
"gearbox changes gears well" in an Alfa that's pretty good.
Just checked car prices here (Australia), a 406 is 15k hahaha
Come and do this challenge again after you upgraded the Peugeot!
The fastest that Saab has ever been
Smacks wasp, yeahh i'm being attacked XD
my saab 95 that was b234 swap can a 5 sec wanna race????😁
defently more g wagon
To me the Alfa was the better car. Busso 2.5 24v must be faster than the Peugeot even without weight reduction. Love watching Carwow though!
Where is yanni?  Oppss wrong car channel  But all jokes aside car throttle is a million times better than car wow
I dont know why you didnt buy a 3 litre s type
Got an e46 for £500 and I definitely prefer that yo the peugeot
i am always glued to your content. just watched the first film by Alex on his channel. It is shit. He has no one to bounce off.
Spend £300 on a hot hatch that's done 900,000 miles, spend £700 on tuning, weight reduction and nitrous. Basically a nitrous powered go kart and have the time of your life....before spinning out and ending it in a fireball.
Headlights look like an s15
should have done some weight reduction to the Peugeot
Damn 406 is a great car, please don't ruin it, there aren't many more left, especially the V6 coupes. Maybe some service/restoration video soon?..
I only watched this so I can hear Alex go "ollld aaahht your aannnd".
Why cant cars be that cheap in the states. Here any turd is worth $10 grand. Like 20 yrs old 200k miles and needs work kinda turd. I bought a car a year ago for $2,800 and half a year later it is now worth $7,500. Probably worth even more now. Prices are just bonkers!
Next episode it's the G with a 406 on a trailer vs a GBP 1000,- CBR 600 :P
Getting pissed off with prizes for America on a British car channel
French's answer to ferrari 360...only its front engined fwd v6 car 🤭
It would have been cool to the difference between the Peugeot towing the Saab :P
A seal pup had me in stitches..
You basically bought the 406 for the price of its bumpers, that's a steal
Man it would be great if you spruced it up and see for how cheap you could make it even faster, it is in really nice shape
Buy a fto 2.0 v6
Put Jack in the Gwagon, see what that does.
Peugot vs DBX 707+trailer
Been waiting for a new challenge like this for ages!
"look how fast that back is"
That 406 Coupe is a future classic. If you fixed up that one, it’ll be £15k in a couple of years.
Whose this new freelancer? He looks like he's pretty decent tbh.
11:12 he said mega just so you know 😂
Well that wasn't exciting.
Should go with a 95 aero
the french s15 lookin nice.
I would like to see the free car challange. Find a free car, get it MOT’d with a budget of 500 and race against eachother.
I reckon a Mazda RX-8 231bhp 6 speed. For under 1000. Would have nailed it
look how fast that back is haha
I brought a e46 325i m sport coupe the other week for 450£ so the deals are still out there
The ZF auto box on the coupe has a "Sports" mode operated by a strangely hidden button.  I wonder if those guys found it.  It makes a real difference to the way the V6 puts down its power and manages the gear changes to optimise acceleration.  Seriously, the 406 Coupe was never designed as a drag racer but a high speed luxury cruiser for the French Autoroutes down to the Cotes d'Azur. I've done that and in that environment it does everything that you need for an idyll drive! 😍
I hereby request more races with a Gwagon and a trailer. Thank you
Definitely do that again ! Great name for it should be ….. Trailer Trash 🤣
That's it the 406 will be unobtainable for most now 😂😂
Stop doing giveaways for USA only your a UK channel
So I brought my first car in February, done me decent until I past my test 😢in may, the starter motor needs replacing and the map sensor, both cost around £180 total, I’ve already replaced the exhaust and put loads into it, it’s a VW Polo 2005 1.2L with 144000 miles would you go ahead and fix it or scrap it.
IVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE 406 COUPE IN FOREVER, I DROVE A 2.2 HDI STAGE TUNED IT WAS AWESOME, IM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THEM AND AM VERY JEALOUS OF YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh my god i cant believe u got a 406 coupe
subbed to alex's new channel, looks good,
Would have thought s type jag 😉
I had a 407 coupé - video n my channel - way better.
You had a grand Could you have spent the £100 left over on Improving the Peugeot performance?
I've never laughed harder than when the Saab revved up on the trailer 😂
Love the channel but Omaze is a dreadful company, really disappointed to see their ads on here
Did they do any service on the 406?!
dep carthotthl
Imagine that you go down the autobahn and you're doing 160 km/h and see an G wagon with an trailer flying by!
Am i the only one who loved that V8 burble of the G?
a good service for 406 I guess would give the edge to properly beat it. still good content.
I'd like to see the 406 coupe on Alex's channel for a good service and before and after performance testing then come back for this race again here. As many others have said, servicing all the fluids, gearbox included, and this could go in the Peugeot's favour given how close it was here, at least with a rolling start. The budget even had room for that, £100 below it. Like you said, this was meant to happen. Given Alex's attachment to the 406 Coupe, it would be a lovely opener to his channel while linking to Car Throttle as where he started YouTube. It completes the story and would really show there's no hard feelings between anyone, as unfortunately is often the case when we hear of someone going their own way, so something linking the 2 channels in a way that we can see but not strictly spoken about keeps the channels obviously independent shows everything is actually all good for once with someone wanting to change the course of their life.
That was all Ethan's fault, he should have got in the boot of the Saab :)
Can't believe alex has left!
True story; Me and a friend accidentally helped organise a near identical experiment to this once a few years ago! Mate's Ford Focus estate turbo exploded on the way home from a fishing trip just outside Norwich, turns out matey doesn't have proper breakdown cover to get us back to South Essex because we're too far from home, on a Sunday, and they want to charge him an extortionate amount to recover it. Bloke who comes out initially to look at whether the runaway turbo is 'repairable' by the roadside on behalf of the breakdown company (that he got with his car insurance) is a bit of lad, sees our predicament and how the insurance/breakdown company are trying to rip-off us off and offers to help us out _privately_ for half the price. We gleefully agree; phones his friend who arrives in his £120k+ G-Wagon ...plus a big trailer!!! All being a similar age, recovery guy & friend with G-Wagon give us proper bants all the way back to Essex for not having proper breakdown cover and having an exploding turbo shit box - in the process of the journey home G-Wagon owner is keen to show off how he can beat near all other cars from a standing start at traffic lights meanwhile pulling a Ford Focus Estate laden with a further tonne of fishing gear. Those wagons are amazing! Despite being a shit afternoon initially it got quite fun toward the end and eternally grateful to our G-Wagon saviour for getting us home that day! Big up the Great Yarmouth massive if you're reading this.
I had a 406 coupe when I was 20 and it cost me 4grand a year in parts to keep running haha. Car itself was 1000 bucks
POV: you're here after seeing Alex's new video
Will subscribe now that the annoying one has pissed off! Please don't replace him with another unfunny gobshite.
the rolling race was brilliant, might be getting rid of my mk4 polo soon. i might give it to car throttle for some challenges
You should service the Peugeot and get some of its power back then have a rematch
Well depends! Get it maxed out to the max fastest G‐WAGON Ever! Will look forward seeing it!🤣🤣🤣🤣
they made fun of the pt cruiser but didn't notice the purple one was a GT which I think had a 260hp turbo i4?? same one from the neon srt lmfao
keep doing cheap car things
My grandads idea of an “old man in retirement” car was a green 1999 406 3.0 V6. White leather seats, wood vernier, 3 speed auto… it was lovely and if you put it in sport mode, it became a different beast
Please for the love of god dont wreck the 406!
More of this!
Could modify the Peugeot to beat the g wagon or if that works possibly modify it into something to compete with something faster then a g wagon tho for about £450 you are kind of limited unless you spend like a fair amount more then the cars worth but would be an interesting project car I guess it's probably an original idea and probably not many of these modified
You could sell tickets to let people sit in the saab.
Interesting. I definitely saw a video of an F90 M5 towing a ‘small’ (relatively speaking) yacht and it was racing a golf GTi of some sort at the lights. Easily 200 plus bhp and DSG. The M5 was pulling away like there was no tomorrow. Just puts it in to perspective eh!
put the peugeot in the workshop and do a list of the costs to make it nice again :)
I have a 2001 406 V6 manual estate and would never sell it. Brilliant car. The auto box in them coupes are awful. Manual coupe running perfectly would beat g wagon every time.
sega daytona usa 'rolling start'
That 406 gearbox was already shit when it left the factory 🤣. If the 406 was a manual, it probably would beat the G.
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.   (Revelation 2:7) - Only Jesus is our eternal life. Repent. Jesus is coming soon.
Awesome video guys. Loved it
Car throttle will never be the same without you Alex gone but not forgotten
Let the people in the chat pik the car. If you like it, race it to the g wagon.
Good to see all three together. That kind of chemistry is really, really hard to find/make. The BBC has spent  trying do that, and not got near the on screen presence that these three have. As for the G wagon, they're incredible things. I once got stuck behind one at a track day at Snetterton. Every braking zone and corner I caught up with it, and every straight it disappeared with an amazing noise.
Spat my tea out ay "look how fast that back is"
should have gone for a small mapped turbo diesel.
Alex's face when Jack said his spirit animal is a seal pup 🤣
you could easily found a saab 2.3t that would smoke that amg 😎
Speaking of hyundai coupes, I got a gen 3 face lift 2.7L, 58k miles for £1.5k, best purchase ever !!
Wow im actually surprised about how well maintained this 406 is.. its a steal for 990 pound car lol
I want that astra
I'd love to see you guys make the Peugeot a nice street/track car. It really is a brilliant looking vehicle.
I think it'd be interesting to try to find a car that can beat the time of a truck towing the car.  So weight will both help and hurt you.
Should've got another 406 (or whatever ) for the trailer , so then could find out if said car is faster on its own, or when being towed by a G wagon :)
Turweston!! Literally 10 mins from my house 😂
Now strap a pair of turbos on to the 406 and go for a rematch fellas 👍
This was released on my birthday
what about a video where you buy a shitbox with a tow hook and compete on the track with a trailer and a g wiz on it
I absolutely love the 406, I've wanted one for years but I live in Canada
I tell all my friends about how the 406 has the Pininfarina touch Damn alex pushing the value up before i buy one
That 406 is actually a really good car for £900, looks good and is a V6
DID Eathan cut down the table for you Alex? It now half the size in the livingroom
Ferrari body kit needed
Soooo sad you left car throttle Alex
Can We Beat A G-Wagon With £1000?.........Easy Buy a £20 baseball bat abd beat it with  that
GoodBye Alex.
11:10 no alex, these have always been cool, there just arent many of them about.
A fabia VRS would be able to win, easily can be got for under 1k and with a simple remap would be quicker than the 406
no
"BMW's are out for 2022" so that's why Alex left!
Please Service and  remap the 406 and repeat this test!
The process of deciding the challenge car was as dusty as the pink of great auntie's sofa which blended seamlessly with the 80's pine and magnolia student des res backdrop.  Somewhat revived by the quite interesting selection of 406 and mercifully, once drag day came (next time frocks, stillies, full make-up and tiny purses please gents, to liven up the relentlessly "small town, verging on Soviet, provincial grey" wash of the overall palette)  but spoiled by the "3 amateurs' antics" - opposed to "3 pros tit arsing around" - whereby some vague didgery pokery  occurred in the second race to artificially create tension by engineering a "one all" result going into race 3.  All that being said,  the chaps worked well together within an undoubtedly very limited budget and resources. Moreover, despite the inherent and inevitable "blokiness" of three young men sitting around discussing cars, I wasn't annoyed once and the editing was so nearly perfect  -  enough to capture the interest and detail of the thought processes behind the age old "performance for price" formula, without entering another dimension. I think I only hit ffwd 10 secs once or twice. I think that warrants a like and subscribe, whatever the hell that is😏
The 406 Coupe is an awesome car.  I had the 2.2 petrol 4cyl, which was 160HP, which was sort of the sweet spot between the petrol-hungry V6 and the slightly gutless 136HP 2.0 petrol.  Loved it, owned it for over 7 years.  Such a nice car.  EDIT: mine was scarlet red - just a gorgeous colour for this car.  Manual gearbox, too.
need to get cars with JB on for an episode, autotrader guru himself
I love this, there was a 406 v6 coupe in red that parked right behind the bus stop I used to have to walk to, to get to school. Every morning I'd oggle at the shape of the PininFarina design. Sometimes if I was lucky the owner would come out for work and start it up on a cold morning before heading out. Just a weird car story of mine that has had me wanting a 406 v6 coupe since I was about 13, I'm 25 now! 😳
Car Throttle does This vs That. I'm down for that  Also, that 406 Coupe needs its own revival series; lovely cars
That alfa 166 at 3:12. Is the bollox!
The next race the G Wagen has to tow the 406
absolutley love the g63 but Im not paying for a fuel tank that gets 15 to 16 mpg hahaha
Perhaps the challenge could have been the Peugeot had to be towed which means precise weight judgement would be needed
Why not service the coupe and fix the eml then rematch
I Love it how the gWagon tilts at acceleration due to its massive Torque
Lol that purple PT Cruiser GT 2.4L was likely the best option for a drag race….if it was making at least 75% of its original 215 horsepower heh
I'm glad you bought the 406 because I wanted to see how it'd perform, however I believe the Ford Cougar would have won the drag race.
Sad that Alex is leaving Car Throttle.  Would've loved to see the Peugeot 406 built into an aero car and challenge the G65 again.
Or a seal pup. Dead.
won't be the same without alex
Drag racing idea £2,000 offroad car also dragging a trailer and car
the 406 is awesome, we had one when i was little, love that car
how about you each have to buy 2 Cars for 2K combines, one to tow the other
The g63 only does 5,5?! Lol
Boy racer (go faster stripes included) the hell out of the Pug and have a rematch!
If you buy a PT cruiser again it should only be to set it on fire.
The Alfa 166 v6 busso was a lot faster and a lot cooler.
Gwagon towing vs Tesla model Y towing
They’re copying Carwow and Top Gear
1:15 maling change ? Start be stopping buiging these monster cars
I would like to see this drag race again with the same cars but first, fully service the Peugeot plus change the fuel filter, fix the engine light issue, check tyre pressure.
Good fun! Maybe get a dodgy golf 4 V6 for that money, might of done the job 👍
How come they are posting less videos lately?
Now lets see living with a Peugeot 406 Coupe please
Love the 406 coupe.  I would have picked a Saab 9-5 aero for this challenge, you can get a ropey one for under a grand, and so much torque.
Is it bad that I knew it was a 406 Coupe through the pixels on the thumbnail?
I've always loved the look of the 406, awesome video hope you keep it and make it into track car or something
406 v6 good   Autobox bad
0:03 Level pegging? Other butt buddy must be taller lol
I wanna see a under £500 challenge. Would be awesome to see how much faster the 406 can get with just basic stuff like an oil and filter(s) change, some redex and a remap.
g wagon towing a trailer and car was a brill video more plz boys bring it on.
I got a 2002 Honda Civic (EM2) 1.7Vtec (Automatic) 127k on the clock for £950.   Best. Buy. Ever   Such a rare gem of a car
Alex leaving car throttle
Should have got a Audi A8/S8
I absolutely loveeee the 406 coupe!
now do proper service to that 406, and then try again
The pt gt would be the best choice. SRT4 motor with 230hp 245 torque stock, pull the line off the wastegate and you have 300hp for the drag race
More of this plzzzzzzzz
4.2 Jaguar S-type would have had it, if you can find one these days as thery are going up.
I just found out that my mums old Audi is due to be scrapped because the guy my parents sold the car to didn’t tell his wife about the problem with the oil and so now it’s basically blown up and is due to be scrapped and with all the great and not-so-great memories and I thought fellow car enthusiasts would feel the pain. I wanted to buy the car back one day but now it’s gone forever. R.I.P 2005 Audi A4 Avant 1.9 TDI ❤️
I'm sorry but that PT Cruiser Ethan found would simply wipe the floor with the 406. That thing being the GT has the same 2.4 turbo from the Dodge Neon SRT4 just with less power (223hp and 244ft lb). With a tune you obviously get even more. Yes it is ugly but what would be more hilarious than chopping fools (like Alex) with a purple PT Cruiser?
Damn! I can't believe you managed to pick up such a tidy 406coupe so cheaply!  especially considering its the V6, still has MOT, is running and driving well, near immaculate interior, and comes with a fully documented service history most likely from brand new given the size of the folder! Twas a mix of dubious excitement and hopeful doubt I saw on Alex's face when they stumbled across an unlikely deal for a desirable car that I'd suspect is on its way to being considered a future classic and like me has lusted after the sexy Coupe ever since first laying eyes on it in 1997. GenZoomer and Millennials no that's not a typo, it really is a 97.  Just like another of the sexy late 1990s Coupes the FD RX7, this model 406 coupe's design still looks modern even by today's standards and in my humble opinion is even better looking than most of today's offerings. Not many people even know the chief designer for this abnormally gorgeous looking Peugeot was in fact Ferrari's Lorenzo Ramciotti who penned the 456 and 550 maranello 😍👌
The G-Wagon is suck a tacky car in my opinion, but this is a great race, good fun lads.
left money to stage 1
You guys should all have £500 to find cars that tow your own car on a trailer and see who wins, will be so slow but so so funny and cool to see what you guys come up with
406 coupe is a decent looking car, V6 manual should be a good future classic for not to much money.
A 407 2.7 would be good
A ropey MGTF 160?
4:09 killed me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
WOKE bollocks
Now give the 406 a proper service, strip it a little and repeat!
It wasn’t Ethan checking for milky residue 😭
Love the 406 coupe, the calibra coupe was juicy as well.
Aww man I miss my coupè. Had a powerflow exhaust fitted and it sounded amazing!
Please buy my Hyundai coupe I got a 2l 09’ even got a custom plate 😂
Drag race aside, a Busso for 1 grand? Wooooow.
Shame Alex has now left Car Throttle.
This will evolve in to a Chelsea tractor pulling competition.
you should buy 2 of the same car and see if the gwagon can tow it faster than on its own, would be a funny sight
BUT HANG ON MAN.. 01:11 in this video. I want a Mercedes G-Wagen 🚙that is good for the environment... I want one that runs on recycled farts and organic lentils.  Then we can all sit and play the acoustic guitar and eat organic beans
See if the 406 can do the quarter-mile faster on the back of the G. Kinda hoped to see that.
I wanted to take part in the competition until I heard what the cause was
Should have bought the Alfa.
"Ford Kay-Ay" LOL.  Car guys that don't know it's pronounced 'Ka' (like car but without the 'r'). :)
What a great video really liked it with these cheap car challenges. Be good to see more of these. Keep up the great work.  I love to do a drag race with my skoda vs one of your cheap cars
these are so fkn pretty, ive had 2 of them and i love them
I had a 406 coupe 2L petrol - very thirsty and low power 140bhp but beautiful.....miss it too
That 166 must be fucked, good ones with the Busso V6 are rare as hens teeth and going up in value.
Alex on 2 different channels is gonna get so confusing.
car like this will never exist anymore
I can’t open the G-wagen competition, just redirects to a house :(
Alex: did you say that bcos it had the word fastback in it?.. Ethan: Yes. Lmao 🤣.  Ethan; Look at how fast that back is 😆 🤣 😂  I'm Done
With car prices as high as they are it’s good to see a v6 for 1k.
I had one of these, best car I have ever owned!
Who's here after alex left ?
You could use the 100£ from to fix the peugeot as much as you can before the drag race.
Be intriguing to see how mucin power the Peugeot has lost over the years
You should do an episode where you try to find the worst car that runs and has MOT
My dad had a 406 coupe V6 brand new in 1999. Loved this car.
Should have put 4 people in the G and just 1 in the 406.
Some mode's for the 406  And do another drag ?!!!
isnt the engine in the car from mitsubishi Diamante?
You are not normal people 😄😄
So happy to see a 406 coupé here, I own one and it is my first car (not the V6 sadly, the little 2l petrol). But it is such a great daily. It's comfy, nice to drive even 23 years after its first run, and there is enough performance for most if the situation. And even here in France, we don't see some that often. Love it !
G wagon is a novelty car
Call me crazy but Id kinda rather have that peugeot
I live in Australia (originally from the uk) and literally seen a 406 coupe outside the bottle shop last week. had to take a 2nd look. didn't even know they had them out here. reminds me of watching the brittish touring cars as a kid
Are you doing any more podcasts ?
The G is a beast
A class w168 2.0 turbo 192 hp
The L7X engine is pretty good and its easy to take them to 225bhp the same as the original Clio V6.  However Renault, Peugeot, and Citroen have stopped all parts support for this engine. They leak oil so bad from the plastic rocker covers and without part support they are a nightmare. I used to have 2 Laguna II V6's but ended up scrapping both as i could not maintain them anymore.
RIP last Alex episode [*]
As an American it's always nice to see cars we never get over here (that I didn't even know existed).
Like and subscribe if you love MrBeast❤
You should have taken the air filter out of the 406 for the last race to see if it would have given you some more top end.
3:08 "Look how fast that back is." 🤣
Peak Ethan in this episode
I reckon you’d get 11% more power from the 406 with a good service and a bottle of Lamborghini
challange you have 2k to buy a car and upgrade it to max performance and race the g without a trailer and do a drag race
that chrysler pt is the car equivalent of a transvestite snowflake.
Finally my kind of drag race
Not gonna lie, that charity or whatever it's called sounds like a waste of time
probably the fastest jack''s saab ever went
Give the 406 coupe a tune up and do that same drag race!!
https://youtu.be/6n61IIDAdrM  I'll just leave this here. Omaze isn't a charity... They're actually pretty shady when you investigate a bit further...
Mi16 406
I think the 406 should be tuned up or at least have a full engine rebuild and turbo and then try it again
It's bad I can recognise most aircraft from those drone shots. Also ME 12:09 😂 (by the back wheels)
Did u not consider a mondeo st220
Give me the g wagon
Service it and do it again
That saab is so fucking nice
Pity you got the automatic, very bad for drag racing. Second gear goes to 130km/u. Manual is way quicker, automatic doesn’t do 0-60mph in 7,4 sec I think. About the EML, start by changing the coil packs. Very common failure, I saw you had the original black ones. Unbelievable it still has those. Valve covers are very common to leak, yours leak to. The internals of the ES9 V6 are very strong, no oil usage even with high miles.
As someone from the US it would have been very interesting seeing what would have been available to try this challenge. Also its fun to see a challenge that my personal car might have a chance at. I've got an 05' Buick LeSabre Limited, its a decent car you can find for not too much and with a service its a 3.8L V6 with 200+ HP and a 4 speed gearbox. Probably still would've been beat out but still would have been cool to see.
Only way to describe the G Wagon is ‘Footballer’s car’ for sure!!
Would love to see the AMG race against a SAAB 9-5 Aero Hot. 250bhp….. 🤔
Would have been a perfect opportunity to test the "pulls like a train"  saying tdi owners love. Cheap pd engined golf or something similar and map it
I had one of those 323f's in red as my first car. Awesome thing
I’d love to see another tour vid from u guys
Where did Alex get that E46 shirt from? I want one now
No one else spotted the no reverse written on the screen from the auction house ?
I rather have 406 than the g wagon
We want to see more, that was brilliant mates, camera work is Champions league, outstanding work. Thank you from Barcelona.
Where's your podcast gone guys !!!!!!!!
Shame that G63 has that GROSS, illegal plate
On this episode of This vs That... Nice work. The peugeot is possibly the best looking peugeot they've made.
Have got one a year ago for 250€
Can you do a top speed run somewhere? See how fast the 406 can still go after all its years
if alex wins a G wagon his first thing he does is buying some steps to get into the car !
That G wagon is cool AF 😎  Peugeot sort of too 😁
I know Alex has "left" but please never stop making these videos. It's the three of you that makes these videos much more enjoyable. Car throttle is not Car throttle without all three of you present.
Upya game boys cmon same old
I hope you tune up the 406, and race again.
When two cars racing and you finish at 3rd place... :D
Peugeot used to do so beautiful cars back then.
GREAT FUN!!
Weight reduction and only 1 person in the peugeot. So the G will los😏
Are you keeping the 406?  Would be nice to see another project car.
Less of Alex more of Ethan.
Clearly Omaze doesn't give a f**k about the enviroment or anything else... I would rather have a Plaid or a Lucid
mega vid guys always enjoy your content keep going i smashed that sub
Is anybody else having an issue where you click on the omaze link and it takes you to a page for a house in the Cotswolds??
I want to see the Pug get modified and then a few drag races with it 🤣🤣
....,and why are the Japanese cars baned from this chalange????
lmao the omaze page is gone already
Sweet s15 if you know you know 😜
How did you guys not get Ethan in the g wagon, would of gave the peguot a good chance
1 day later the omaze thing redirects to some house draw
Don't know why you keep saying 406, it's clearly a Nissan Silvia
As a Peugeot 406 coupé owner, it made me happy to see one in this video. I wasn't expecting it since Brits love to shit on anything French.
This vs Tat. Has a ring to it 😆
Definitely do more of these videos. People love underdogs and new cars, so evening out the odds and still having both is very entertaining
Hope to see more of the 406 coupe . Make it a manual ! And make it sound better and drive sharper like alfa gta or something that would be cool
What about an ancient  audi c4 or an wv passat
Now see if you can find a car for 5000 that can beat the G-Wagon without the trailer.
No bi-turbo, no deal! You are so lucky to find such a great deal. Lose the Ethan ballast. But all of your enthusiasm was very infectious
14:43 😂😂
Tune it !!!!!
Bye bye alex
Me: *it would be interesting to see a rolling start from 20* Alex: let’s do a rolling start from 20mph   Love the amount of effort that goes into these videos 😂
Why anyone apart from Lewis Hamilton (cos he thinks he is "gangster") would buy one of these is beyond me.
I think you guys need to up the $$$ on your cheap car challenges. the way the market is right now a grand ain't much. would def make the challenges more spicy if you had a little more cash to throw at it.
Yes Alex, I sure want to see more dragraces with the G Wagon towing a car
I wanna get Alex doing an impersonation of starting the London taxi cab as my alarm ring tone.
I reckon they should put the 406 on a dyno to find out if that EML wad holding them back... see if it was actually putting 210bhp through the flywheel.  And if it wasn't, get it back and recalling the G Wagon
Did anyone else find that charity description to be super vague?
You needed to get a bike!
You fancy giving me the 406 ill take care of it honest.
I thought they would’ve bought some shitbox and slapped a cheap eBay turbo kit on it
“Or a seal pup?” *silence*
The link redirects you to 'win a house'..
More videos with the 406 coupe😉
Ethan should've been in the G-wagon to help that Peageout out abit...
yes alex, MAKE THIS A THING!
Yes, more drag races with the G-wagon towing the Saab!
Yes
i've always thought these things were actually really pretty in a very understated way.
The gwagon is a stupid car for stupid people 😂 love cheap car challenges
Should have run with Ethan as passenger in the G Wagon. That last race was close enough it might have put the 406 just ahead.
I really want to see that peugeot naked , striped out doing a lap around the track
Jack I want to buy your saab!
Can't help but love the g wagen, not it black though
Owned one loved it. here is mine at full song sounding awesome https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSdTpnXMW1A
not watched the vid but ill guess a 3 series? if not some bmw
I kinda figured the G wagon would win this... But im happy the Peugeot still gave it a good fight. The 406 with manual transmission might would have had it in at least the last 2 races... The automatic on these old Peugeots are absolutely horrible, but still nontheless the V6 is definitely the one to have.
There is a classic race like this between av Alfa Romeo 4C and a Tesla Model X towing another 4C on a trailer. The Tesla won...
Would have been interesting to see if the 407 is quicker by itself or when being towed on the trailer by the G.
You guys should check some other auction houses yourself too! You can find steals from there with a low price, i found my 7 series e38 yea its a 725tds but i got it with a 1/3 of a price of one and it was working perfectly.
I propose a rematch, spend what you paid for the pug on upgrades for it and try to beat the G-wagon again. it would make an awesome vid.
Put some good tyres on that Peugeot and it will smoke the G wagon.
Awsome guys😎🇳🇴
Would buying a motorbike for one of these challenges be cheating?
On every challenge i feel bad for you cause you don't have eBay Kleinanzeigen. In Germany you can set the search filters to 300 hp for 1000€ and find a car in seconds.
I’d defo wanna see more of this challenge idea, Maybe try £1500 next time and up the budget until you win. Or even try and see what it takes to make the Peugeot beat the AMG
Can i have the 406 pls
My LEAF would have bet that.  Does 90mph
The Pug needs NOS and loose some weight
Do we get to see Saab Vs Peugeot now? 😁
Collected a 280-GE (LWB) on a 4 wheel trailer from Bridgewater to Exeter. Unfortunately the tow car (the only one available at the time ) was a 360 Volvo. Still managed an average of 60 mph - and didn't get stopped by Mr Plod.
That apology was way overdue
“We’re on a level. “ 😂😂😂😂😂
Should off looked for a 3.0 V6 ST220 Mondeo, can pick them up for around £700-£1000
I can't believe they didn't think of the 2.7 Bi-turbo C5 A6 or early to mid 2000s Saab 9-5 2.3. For 1000 pounds they would've been in a really rough shape, but probably good for a few drag runs, before start pissing oil and coolant everywhere. But still 250-260 hp and with manual transmission.
SEAL PUP !!!!! LMFAO
Ka! Kah! KAAHHHH!!!! Stop spelling out the two letters, it's just one word - there's even audio out there of the head Ford dude pronouncing it years ago when it was unveiled (just Google how to pronounce it, please!!).
VW Touareg? Nobody?
The 406 coupe is a beauty.
Please make a series on the 406. Some nice rims and some engine tuning😍
More 406 content please
Cheap car challenge can never stop! Best show
Yes, but…brake test?
Omaze? Seriously?!  Less than 20% of the "donations" are going to the good cause. Nearly the worst way to donate money.
Genuinely believe you guys are on par with the old Top Gear trio.
Well if you’re going to bring drag races into this, 100% do drift car vs budget drift car and you have a budget of 10k including the price of the car 👌 good luck
I had a fencing business and a Nissan dual cab with an LS2 swapped in. I was towing a trailer with my skid steer on it from the back paddock on a huge farm. One of the other guys was driving a 79 series Landcruiser and decided to race me. I know that Landcruisers top put around 150kmh and I was pretty sure I could top it. So I was doing 165 flat out towing around 2500kg on a farm track. It actually wasn't too bad because I had really good trailer brakes and it stayed pretty planted.
Thats not bad buying. The Brembo brakes off the 406 go for £300
This is what we want, no electric car BS
Great video
I was watching a video about pickups that u can't get in the UK and the Peugeot u just got reminded me of the one I saw in that list and now I just remembered u trued making one why did u not finish it I was really liking that project
Should've kicked Ethan out for the last run.
Don't Google Ropey Cougar 😂😂
Please tune that 406 and race it again
I'd love to see how much modding it would take to get the 406 to win. Might be a cool little project car
Carwow much 😉
The caravan speed record is 141.998 mph with an unmodified caravan (just updated tyres), how about trying to beat that?
We need a 150mph challenge with the Peugeot!
As it's a drag race how about Alex dragging the G Wagon against the others dragging that peugeot? lol
Do a £3,500 80s/90s car challenge
I re subscribed bc I saw that Alex was leaving. It's not personal he's just so loud and it's like his angle on comedy is loud=funny and I cannot stand it. It was unwatchable. I just want to give honest feedback.
Jack loves the Saab, I've spotted some new additions to the styling 😉  I'm so proud 😁
Here's an idea: £1000 car with £1000 in mods Vs £2000 car
Never thought I'd see a fellow 323f mentioned on the  channel
chiptune the peugeot and try it again
Great to know that you guys will still be working together and doing videos together ❤️
but can it beat the GWIz
You be careful with that Saab on the back!!!! Classic car there 😉
Looking at the advisories on the mot, I think I'd have chucked a couple of new tyres on the 406 before doing any high speeds!
Mazda RX8 can be had really cheap.....
sat down, saturday morning, food on the plate, latest car throttle video - life's good
You guys are crazy! 😂
When's Alex leaving
The G-Wagon no traitor vs. Piston powered Plane. My bill is on the plane.
Looks great that 406 coupe... Was my favorite "coupe" of this vintage 😉
Give the Peugeot a good service, sort the engine light and any other issues, add a little acetone to the petrol tank, and give it a second go.
That 406 has got the 190bhp V6 in it. The later ones got the 210bhp upgrade. Stunning cars, my dad had one of the first back in 1997 in Lugano green.
People forget just how God peugeot were in the 90s and early 2000s
Can you keep the 406 and modify it and try again?
BCA fresh Peugeot
You guys should try a cheap car vs the G on a auto cross track
Scratching around for ideas this channel is now 😴
I was hopeing for more after a 2 week wait
You need to make a collaboration with CarWow!
Nice to see you Fully load the trailer with a 2Ton car
My saab 9-5 0-5 stock bar intake made 145 mph saloon 2.0 T
CHALLENGE IDEA!!!!!  You guys seriously need to do a hilarious video having a race with three cars using only SPACESAVER WHEELS!!!!  A hilarious race going only 50mph!!!!  Please do this!
No , I just want to see shit boxes no GWagon towing.
You guys should go back to that drag strip you went with that Volvo and see if this car does 150 Mph
3:18 to 3:21 is priceless on so many levels
I love the 406, currently owning one for more than a year now, it’s a 1996 Coupe pack edition and it’s a really nice and confortable GT that has some sport potential sometimes, really buy them now while they’re still cheap, future classic for sure !
That 406 is well posh, in it. I have a £30k Porsche and a £3k Alfa Romeo. Same results in drag races between the 2 as this. Porsche kills it off the line but start at 20 mph and there’s not much in it. NA big engine v turbo smaller engine. Love your work 👍
Misread the title as G-Wizz 😂
Should’ve stripped the Peugeot… perhaps may have had a better chance😅 love the videos, keep it up 😂😁
Review 406?
My grandparents used to own a TT,it was so small we all had to crouch in it,it was cute though,i also learned to shift gears with it,good memories
Are we getting another special? Since jezza and Co left top gear I have missed a good special. Your trip to Scotland was a brilliant watch and I need more!
Not gonna lie the 406 coupe is a great looking thing. Just a shame about i terior and how slow it was... Especially with a 6 in it lol  I do not.. Wanna see more g wagon rubbish lol expensive boxes. No one dreams of that profile when growing up and I dont wanna see it further lol
it you like .. take the seats out ...
🐢 I had one of these cars ,was my late father's and I put my heart and soul into restoring it....awful electrics made of cooked spaghetti, bonded together engines that leak like a watering can....I wish I'd never started....but my god they were beautiful and felt like a budget Aston with the V6....I'd imagine great cars when new.
Considering the check engine light was on in the Peugeot, there's a good chance that was in limp mode right? So it would probably have beaten the G-wagon if that was fixed.
Every YouTube channel: new at least 2020 g63 Carthrottle: 2016 g63
This was a great idea and I really enjoyed watching it.   I would like to pitch an idea to you three, instead of towing Jack's Saab, use the G-Wagon to tow the cheapest similar car to that you are racing. For example, you raced against a Peugeot 406, then the G-Wagon should tow the cheapest similar spec Peugeot 406 to see which are handles the weight better. Will the 406 win against a G-Wagon towing a 406, who knows?  Thanks for all the hours you have given for this passion of filming cars. It's honestly one of the extremely few shows that resemble the OLD Top Gear.  Cheers
hey bois, what happened to the podcast
Brabus will tune the Wagon to 900bhp for their Clients.
Fuck yes! 406 for the win! I mean I know it lost but I don't care, just super happy to see a 406 in a carthrottle video
As for the trailer idea continuing, no.
Screw millennials
Peugeot would have had it if they didn’t take a passenger.
Idea: spend 2 grand or so modifying the 406 then race it against something 10 times more expensive like a golf gti. Title could be 3k car vs 30k car
I owned a 3.0 V6 406 coupe back in 2009 for which i only paid £1500 for a 1999 model. The V6 made such an immense noise at full chat, just a shame its actual performance didn't match up to the sound.   The version I had was the 194 bhp manual not the 204 bhp and that took 8 seconds to get to 60. That 204 auto would take around 9 seconds not 7.4, that was the manual version
Yeah! Might want a 2nd episode on this one. Fixing the challenge car or find another £1000 car. 🙂
I think you should set a catagory then you all go get the car you think is best then do a couple of drag races and then modify them and do it again and see who done the best job!
500 nicka to buy a car that can beat a g wagon towing a trailer and car around curbra
good luck with the new channel alex!!
I don't think there are any moving cars available for 1k pound equivalent.  Markets are so screwed up.
They should do a trade up series untill the car they buy can gap G...start off with selling the 406 plus the 100£ they got left and race each time they buy a new one
What a stupid video idea
thank goodness you guys picked that beauty, an amazing car
I'd love one of those coupes
Omaze link not working for me, it keeps redirecting elsewhere
next video see if you can modify the 406 for £x to beat the g wagon & trailor. would love to be able to hear that v6 lol
well, I bought and tuned a car for about £1500 and it wasn't much slower than a g wagon without something in tow. 0-100 in 5.2 sec and the g63 amg is 0-100 in 4.5. give me some time and another grand or so and I would have beat it. or just risk the engine, turn up the boost and hope the engine doesn't go boom
honestly that peugot would look really good with some better rims on it
Ethan should have been in the G instead of the 406. Let's assume he weighs 70kg, that would be a 140kg difference in favour of the 406.
Should of got a ropey mk3 mondeo st tdci for a round a grand with a stage 1 would of smashed it!
I bought a 406 a few months ago for £450, and it’s been flawless since. Haven’t spent a penny on it. Great car for the price.
You had a £100 left, how much extra power could a bit of a service get you to challenge the G Wagon again?
Modern g wagons are shit, they may be fast and luxurious but I'd still rather have my 300GD 0-60 only happened downhill with a tail wind.
I wanted one since I got my license but never found a good one
PLZ keep the 406 Alex. It'd be a great addition to your new channel!
race it against v6 phil. some say that car has a porsche derived v6
future idea: Try to tune that 406? mainly to increase performance without altering the exterior?  and Question: The engine in Jacks Saab...z19dth? :3 Vectra owner here haha
Pls fix the 406
What happens to the 406 coupe next? Will it get sold for £900??? I gotta ask.
please take care of the 406, v6 model are becoming rare and it is a lovely car, awesome vidéo btw
The automatic v6 is a 🐕.
Nice to see one original and not looking like a Ferrari
I own a 1999 2.5 v6 cougar drives great and still fast this day
“Look how fast that back is!” Creased in the first 5 minutes 😂
Should have got a Laguna 😂😂
Anyone else having problems with the Omaze link?
Rekon if you spent the change on a engine and gearbox service might have done better
In the first quarter of 2022, Chevron’s profit more than quadrupled and ExxonMobil’s profits more than doubled, despite the latter taking a $3.4 billion hit for exiting its business in Russia. ExxonMobil will use these sky-high profits not to ease the burden on consumers at the pump, but to increase its stock buybacks. The oil giant now plans to buy back $30 billion of its own stock, up from the $10 billion it announced three months ago.    This is a direct redistribution from consumers who are paying through the nose for fuel to Big Oil’s investors and top executives (whose compensation packages are larded with shares of stock and stock options).    Oil companies could absorb the higher costs of crude oil. The reason they’re not is because they’re so big they don’t have to. They don’t worry about losing market share to competitors. So they’re passing on the higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, and pocketing record profits.
1st run.... fuck me!!!!!!!!!!!!! wasn't expecting that!!!
Next to this atrocity even cybertruck would look like supermodel 🤢
saab vs trailer "no comment "
why 22 on the omaze link? bad call imo
Why do I have candle in the wind stuck in my head. The candle burned out long before the legend ever did 😭 😭. Oh 😜 I’ll miss Alex on car throttle. End of a era 😞
Reminds me of Jason Cammisa and Johnny Lieberman racing an Alfa 4C against a Model X P90D towing an Alfa 4C.
You need to keep this car!
I think since used cars are so disgustingly expensive just now, you should allow yourself to do a little work on your challenge cars with the leftover change. You could probably fix the engine warning light and give it a service for that £100.
you should do a ferrari replica build on the 406
0:01 sounds like mat watson😂
it is a shame that Peugeot changed the coupe so much. the ordinary 406 had some nice design details that they didn't bring over to the coupe. The tail and headlight as an example looked pretty cool on the ordinary one but a bit weird and boring on the coupe
That g wagen has illegal plates lol
car wow drag strip;)
That seal pup comment caused some damage 😅
Hmm i wut use my first car 1991 bmw m3 e30 coupe shut work
Top Job Chaps 🤘
Can we have a break from Ethan please lol. 😄
thats the best looking peagout ive ever seen wtf
World towing record is held by a ford falcon and you can pick them up for 1000 english pounds in aus.
Amazing how close it was. It‘s been a while now since you had a proper project car. What about keeping it and get the best out of it? Would love to see it and my name suggestion would be Pierre.
I can't put into words how much I love Jack's Saab.
Epic 🔥 should’ve got the 330 that would’ve beat it, great fun
£1,500 budget coupe against G-Wagon and trailer carrying car would be epic.
Love the 406, more of that please
if I won that g wagon I'd sell it, buy e46 m3 and use left over cash maintaining it
“We have an s15 at home.” The s15 at home:
Tune the 405 and do it again
I know u guys do some funny dumb shit, but this was just pure dumb shit, not funny or entertaining. Who's idea was it?
I want to see the G wagon pulling the car it’s racing. Racing a Saab with a Saab on the trailer.
why not mitsubishi magna or galant? v6 3.5 bought one for beater in australia for $500 😂
Make that 406 a project car
try it again with weight reduction
Come to the USA with that G Wagon and I'll race you with my 2006 Saab 9-5 Aero Stage 2 Hirsch Troll R Tune....Drinks are on me.
I think we all can agree that we want more 406 videos, that thing would be such an amazing project car!! 😍
We want the trio to remain! Friends for life. ✌🏼
That Peugeot was begging for some nitrous.
The g (gay) wagon…. A overpriced defender wannabe for the people that want to show they don’t have a small pee pee
Imagine a drag race with 3 budget V6 cars!
you are a UK channel taking US sponsorships... i mean i know you need the money for the channel and what not but...  a bit cringe bro
ps the sport mode on that gearbox is soo bad it kinda seems to forget how to shift
Can you do the same thing with the Saab and the 406 on the trailer with the g wagon if you can try the g wagon on the trailer and see what car take the wight wile driving? should be fun
G-WAGONS ARE HEAVY😯
Oh hello, Peugeot 406 Coupé.  Mostly still forbidden fruit in the US, but legal to import here in Canada.  I wonder if there are any left in St. Pierre and Miquelon...
you should do "living with" video with a P38 vs an alfa (the two most unrelaiable crs)
The link is broken for the competition
Always had a soft spot for these coupes.
Insert "Mind-blown" gif.
Give me the g-wagon
Hang on im in the uk so how the frank can i use omaze
lets do the g wagon with a trailer vs an F90 M5 comp with a trailer🤣
Why does it have Lord Farquaad's logo on the side?
406 Coupé are awesome! Glad to see it featured here!
“Oh my god smell it” *shoves the book in Jacks face* 😂
What a difficult decision ... between a G-Wagon and that Puglet.  Hmmmmmmm.   Nope, I'd walk instead to be honest.
german v8 wagon battle with trailers?
Do this challenge just with 2,500 pounds
Saab towing the g wagen vs the 406 or something else
As an American I'm jealous you could just go buy a mazda 323 at any time. But also sorry that the PT Cruiser is now a problem for your people too 😂
yes yes yes  guys more content :)
End of a night shift. Glad to see you've uploaded!
They're soold school in their thinking going for displacement, could have easily got a 1.8t golf or a3 that would have put up a bit more of a fight, especially with a remap
My dad had one in 2005/2006. Light blue, 3.0 V6 manual with a limited edition boot spoiler. Still my dream car to this day just like Alex and the 944.  They did 150 on private roads in 2005!
Fit a NOS kit to the pug and run the race again.
What would be a cool idea is, if you have budget for the car and budget for mods, say 1k for the car and 1k on mods
This vid gave me some Taxi (the movie) vibes with the Peugeot vs Mercedes 😂
I wish miles had stuck around as long as the Saab on car throttle
Im surprised the G is this slow. It got so much power i thought it would tow with ease
The diesel with a remap is even better
Alex's diesel cold start impersonation is spot on.
Why would you not buy a GS300 for £1k?
No BMW rule and they buy a car designed by    Chris bangle the most famous BMW designer
Won't be much money left for charity after Omaze take their cut plus their 'administration' fees. You have more chance or winning the lottery.....three times. Google them
I'm glad Jack brought up the penguin reference again. That creased me when he mentioned it in the "poddyc".
Didn’t expect to see a Chipmunk on C,T 🙃
Please please pleeaasee restore and revamp that peugot!!
Watched this one being filmed, Was bizarre to have you lot turn up whilst I was at work haha, and almost even more bizarre to watch what you were doing. Was certainly curious.
Why is a Uk channel advertising a competition with free delivery to USA 😂
GGGGGGGGGG WAGEN BABY
I know you have a no BMW rule but ive just searched and found 2 530s that would be quicker...Im only 11 mins into the vid so dont know if the Pug did the job but....     It'd  be the same stories with Mercs. Get an old unloved E320 as theyre going for under a grand and will have more power than the pug (more weight too)
GOFORIT!
Oh man :( I try go to the website and sends me straight to a house to win in the Cotswolds:/ I would rather enter the Merc comp not the cotswold 😅 but great Video of always!
That 406 is a beatiful looking car... but it should be a gas guzzler...
Shame the link for the competition doesn’t work.
It seems like Ethan has gone backwards in his car knowledge 😂
Got a challenge  for you... most fun from a 2.0 tdi for 5k
alex:project mx5 ethan:project z3 jack:???
Did you guys get the turbo PT cruiser? Those are pretty quick
My 2008 corolla 1.8  Do's   160
First and only time that saab will do 100mph 😂
A fridge with wheels could beat it after half a mile, better aerodynamics 😂
give the car too bruno for a bit and try again.??
and you put TWO people in the lower powered car because????
The link just constantly redirects to cotswold house draw
What happened to the podcast guys?? It’s been a year! 😓😓
Should've picked the Rover 827si vitesse. Cheap, V6, absaloute monster.  Fuel isn't cheap though... You can see the the fuel gauge go down..
LOOK FAST THAT BACK IS 😂😂 that is some funny s#+t
Is alex trying to tell us something when he said strap on?
Yesss awesome video.  A manual 406 would have smashed it. The 7-ish seconds 0-60 time is for the manual, unfortunately the auto is a couple of seconds slower (and also won't crack 150.)
You guys should try towing a groundhog over the Severn bridge on a windy day    I did it.  It wasn’t a great experience
what a completely pointless challenge...was just left thinking so what?,,,,,,,,
Ethan always brings the humor, cheers.
Carwows changed
Please stop saying kewpay; it's coupe.You ignore the e on the end and pronounce it like it's spelled coop even though it's spelled coupe.
Omaze is a scam. I love your content but... Change sponsor
Next thing you have to do with the 406 is turn it into a track car  and compair it against its similar styled italian cousin the ferrari 360 also gives alex an excuse to belt a ferrari around the track. We also get to see  Gareth  trying to teach ethan. What's  not to  love
I reckon you’d get 10% more power from the 406 with a good service and a bottle of Redex
Get her modified
It will be the fastest its ever gone!!!! HaHaha
Welp 406 prices 📈
Could’ve easily done it with a bike
So 3 English lads based in UK on Youtube. Ethan "I think I'll enter". Alex "You can't enter". Nobody in UK can enter it's only for people in USA ??? = 1 less subscriber sorry lads tata
To be honest drag race videos have been done to death on YouTube
i think your 406 could use a manual trans swap (if such a thing exists)
Should have used the spare money for go faster stripes and red paint for the calipers
I'll just watch Carwow if I wanna see drag races...
Oh my god I bid on that very car, unfortunately it sold for more than a grande on BCA so didn’t bid any more than that
yes pls
Why didn't they try to find the heaviest car to put on the trailer ?
If you want to get rid of it ill buy it, great cars
I'm glad they didn't choose to use weight reduction on the 406, like they did on the Volvo.
"to leverage social media audiences to raise awareness for social causes", so basically to create paid human bots that will spam about Ukraine or whatever "current thing" is that month.
4:30  With that look, without even seeing the screen, I knew he'd found a PT Cruiser.
Mazda 6 MPS? :)
Jack, do a review of your Saab!!
Best and fastest car under 1k, saab 9-5 2.3 hot aero!
More of any drag races would be SICK
They way he sniffed that leather 💀💀💀
OMG you boys are back on my feed, wtf happened?
What a gorgeous car the 406 Coupe still is.
do some work on the peugeot. and try again later (if the possibility appears) and see if fixes can make it go faster
do mods on the peugeot!
That Peugeot, like all Pugs is pants. My 1.6 TDCi C-Max could have thrashed that 😂
I love that the Saab is still hanging around. What a gem lol
Peugeot 107 could have smoked the G Wagon easyyy
The 330ci would have been better tho
Shamelessly copying This vs That by Hoonigan
Put that 406 on the Dyno see how far away 210bhp is
Always liked the 406 coupe. Worth giving it a thorough service, sorting the EML and comparing drag times. It would be interesting!
Would have been nice to have a benchmark of how fast the Saab would be, without being on the trailer
Was that in Weston airfield in Ireland…?
Well, I would´ve loved to enter at omaze but apparently it isn´t available in germany. :(

You be careful with that Saab. Saabs are love, Saabs are life.
MK5 Golf GTI onwards would be a great race against a loaded up G-Wagen
I would just started looking at ls400s or s500
Why not drag race it now against the Saab ;)
If they had stuck to Vectra GSi idea they would have won. Regardless it was entertaining fair play the 406!
Remapped 335d towing aswell
Yesss i miss those challenges so much! Please bring more of them!
Percy the Peugeot! I love the 406. Brilliant car please sell it to me 😂
man that merc thing must have a f*&K ton of torque to pull like that.
That 330 is much faster than 406. Was there anything wrong with it
I love the way that even though he's changed the brakes on a car, given services, a clutch change and fitted a new exhaust... Ethan still reminds us regularly that he's still clueless about cars 🤣 and such a good sport for taking the flack from the other two... such a legend 😂👍
but can you tow a tank with that mercedes?
4:11 😂😂😂😂😂
damn that Peugeot was amazing, id love to see you do a GT challenge in it down to the south of France, see if a pinin gets any attention in the land of supercars.lol
Ffsss been looking at those peugeots for ages now they will skyrocket
this was incredibly exciting
Turbo the Peugeot
Used to be good, now more staged than old topgear, if in doubt watch again and ask really?
should've reflashed the peugeot for the remaining 100 pounds
Still harder with £1000 to convince Alex to wear a proper size shirt.
Honestly, so salty, always wanted a 406 🤣
That's my early night scuppered
Just ditch the passenger from the 406 and it would have been a tie
London taxi vs 406 towing somthing.
Is it me or does the Omaze link in the description not take you to the right page?
I think barely alive w220 :D or a rotten 95 aero :D
Turn the Peugeot into a track car!
D5 mapped
Great video. Where can I get that Rallye hoodie?
Very pretty cars, the 406 coupe, but boring interior lifted straight from a bog standard 406 rep mobile saloon.
I wanna see more of the 406 tbf
sneaky title change, had to get the G-Wagon in there haha
Just recently sold a 406 V6 Coupe with 60k miles on it. Fantastic car and really quick with a manual box
Do Somthing Good With The SAAB Please
Where is that 323? I want it...
Finaly
I liek it
What fun fast car would you buy under £20k?
hi
"engine light was on but the engine wasnt my worry" says it all with a peugeot
6:57
Could have sworn that I've seen Alex in a purple BMW at the BP garage I was in a blue Ignis sport 😂😂
9:30 1/4m in 14sec, good luck with that, lol! It would be hard to do it in a 330i, nvm this 210bhp fwd car. If you care to time it, I bet it'll be well over 18 sec. (For a comparison, the 2000 CLK 55 AMG did 13.8 with 350 bhp.)
Alex: did you say that bcos it had the word fastback in it?.. Ethan: Yes. Lmao 🤣.  Ethan; Look at how fast that back is 😆 🤣 😂  I'm Done
really happy you guys and the content are staying. Best of both worlds. Nothing really changes for us viewers, while Alex can go off and explore his own ideas and work with brands/creators with whom I assume he wasn't contractually allowed to work with before. Really glad about this :)
I usually love these videos.  This is just stupid, :(
I’m glad to see that Jack has kept his Saab 😁
if you sold the crap mac books and added the money to the pot you could buy a car for £3000
Woke charity??...no fuckin ta. Fuvk em
Astra 1.9cdti remapped. I paid £750 for mine and pretty impressed by it for a cheap run around
Cheap Jeep challenge next
Omaze can piss off
i was a bit sad this night, refreshed yt, you guys posted, cheered me up instantly :))
I love this series, continue pls
finally  😀
Don't say street KA again!
Oh wow im the second viewer
Oh amazing
Been waiting for a new video! Older car buying videos are really making me want to buy cheap s*itbox.
Glad to see the 3 of you all still together after alex went his own way... we get twice as much amazing content, and alex gets to try his own style and content of/in videos. Its a win win situation!!!!! Keep it up guys
comment from germany

cheap car challenges are easily my most favourite videos on this channel!
Absolutely love these, hopefully Alex's channel does something like this every now and then
Not first but not far off. Is this the last episode of the trio? What with Alex leaving
Yooooo what’s up guys! Love the content! Keep up the great work!
Nice 😀👍
