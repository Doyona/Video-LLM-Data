Spike Jordan 🐐
The OG Vixens!!!! Love this!
Gunna folded with bare minimum pressure applied to him his pipe burst before he even knew the state don’t have a case against him close to strong enough to dishonor your close comrades as soon as he did a better outcome and standing on principles that u promote that u stand on could have stood intact with light consequences if he wasn’t so quick to throw his pride away for a comfortable lifestyle again which never was in true jeopardy gunna ain’t just innocent and blind to none of what’s going on so if u popping champagne bottles with your comrades at least apply pressure to stand tall if rain come along he stood short as he can get that’s the issue with him and us ones who believe in staying solid
Run that back turbo ‼️
Song of the year already 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hot mano gunna❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm a 33yr old black woman and I can't wait to hit my 40s if this is what it looks like. These video vixens of the 2000s are way too hot! I Can't wait to be a MILF! Thanks Turbo and Gunna for putting older women on.

Man I love this. Waiting on DOD3 😏😳💧
Who are the models?
Turbo × Wunna🔥🔥🔥
Taught lil baby how to rap and now surpassed him 🐐🐐🐐
Don’t be fooled. It was YSL best interest that gunna took that plea. Who was going to bring the bacon home with both top artist in jail? Who was going to pay the lawyers and court fees?? How would YSL eat? You don’t think Young Thug thought about that? You people quick to believe anything and don’t think things through. His first post on Instagram when he got out was “ Niggas acting like they switching to a side but it’s only one side”. He also said “FREE YOUNG THUG”. You people can’t read between the lines? 🤦🏾‍♂️ y’all slow!!
Man this is hardddddddddddddddddddd the cameraman is going berserk too
Eyup
69 could never...
Alright man the song is fire but those woman are BEYOND beautiful
Where would we be without Gunna man

👀 This was a Motion Picture, a Movie with the Dopest Soundtrack 🎙... You Deserve all these Blessings 🙏🏾🔥🔥🔥...  Love How you brought back Beautiful Queens from Our Cinematic past 🌹🌹🌹
I like the 2000s video vixens actually look human in this video and not extremely filtered out like they did in their past videos. It is refreshing. I think most of them look better than they did when they were in their prime. Their bodies look actually normal compared to extreme plastic surgery altered bodies of today. No disrespect for those who had cosmetic enhancements.
yall got another one free thug gunna not missing on every song
Gunna hit the world TWEAKIN !!! ..IN A GOOD WAY.🔥

Gunna looking built like hellboy🫡
This the best music video I ever seen cinematic masterpiece. Shoutout the film crew and everyone involved
Damn I can’t fw lil gunna and I plan on dying like this FreeBigSlime
Fuck is thinking bout
gunna didn’t snitch on thug or the organization. The feds already had proved that YSL is a gang/music label being funded by the illegal activity and using the legal funds to fund the gang. If a teacher ask you what’s 1+1 you don’t say 4. Gunna took a adherce hearing where he admitted to facts to get released. HE DIDNT INCRIMINATE ANYONE. Learn the judicial system before
Run it back Turbo  💥💫
Gunna is undefeated 🔥🔥🔥
Oh, we here early-early 😅 turn that sh*t up then
