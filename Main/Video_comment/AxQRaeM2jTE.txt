Content like this should not be allowed on YouTube
For the sandwich he didn't get played, those types of sandwiches are front loaded to make them look fuller and go by weight. The second one "Arizona"(the company name) "an American company" (clearly telling you that the company is American not that the product is made in America), therefore explaining the "product of canada" part.
Yo shave your face. Thank me later
Youtube owes me an apology for recommending this video to me for some reason.
Putin threatens to use nuclear weapon, his terrorists occupied two nuclear stations in Ukraine, the first one is Chernobyl and the second - the biggest nuclear station in Europe. I beg you all to support UKRAINE AND STOP PUTIN STOP RUSSIA!!!! SUPPORT WORLD PEACE!!!
Hey bud you need to get out in the fresh air & get some exercise & a life. It will work wonders for your body & brain.
In the ingredients list if it's before it means that there is more of it
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .

Nice mutton chops there 🤡 O’Leary me leprechaun
Let it be known that I have nothing against the creator or the content of this video. Having said, FUCK YOU, YOUTUBE for suggesting something to me that is so far out of my viewing habits one is to wonder if your algorithm was derived by a couple of stoned gibbons and an old TRS-80 Model III.
I think the company is called Arizona.
Your videos always make my day, keep up the awesome content! 🔥
Arizona makes tea. It doesn’t mean that it was made in Arizona but the company probably started there.
Shit bruh look in a mirror
What beard filter is that?
bruh you look like you literally glued hair from a brush to your face.
Imagine thinking Arizona brand is in Arizona 🤣🤣
Jesus Christ died for our sins rose from the dead on the third day. We just have to believe know that we are sinners confess our sins and turn away from our sins and ask for forgiveness and for Jesus be our savior also to get baptized. And we will be snatched from the wrath that is so close. And make God first in our life and seek him with all our mind body and soul and the treat our neighbors as ourselves and we will be snatched from the wrath of God. Be blessed brothers and sisters.
Dislike
Youtube content you won't believe part 1. This guy tried to make an interesting video but actually made the worst most boring video anyone has ever seen.
Bro popped out with a mustache 😂😂
U looks like tommynit just with mustache
Never been this happy to not be someone
They drink was from the brand Arizona not from the state. It's a damn tea and it's delicious. It's not a lie dumb dumb
Screenshot the Arizona can and read all the print on the back of it I'm so glad I don't drink Arizona anymore there's not even indication where it was bottled it says three different states in a different country
No the brand is Arizona...seriously.
bro the wolverine son
The second one is kinda right, but Arizona is a company that makes tea it didnt mean the drink was actually made in arizona the state
Y’all are running your mouths about this guy, show me your face then 💀 🤡
Holy shit a machine didn’t give him the correct blue berry amount. God forbids that
That’s why I don’t buy pre made wraps in any store… they only put the food in the Center, then wrap & cut in half.. the rest of the wrap is empty. Much like the sandwich you presented… also most cheap chocolate is made with 5 times the wax… never buy square desserts in Mexico or chocolate cake… it’s fake!
Can’t believe Jschlatt is branching out to new content 🙏
Is that beard fake too🥲
If TommyInnit and Jschlatt had a son
You mean ARIZONA TEA???
omg I can’t believe this
In the case of the Arizona tea. It is a beverage company headquartered in Woodbury, NY. It is sold worldwide but mainly in the U.S, Canada and Mexico. As millions of this product are consumed yearly it is cheaper to have manufacturers where it is most consumed. Arizona is only the name for shits sake this doesn't need to be made into a video. Now that I have wasted 5 minutes of my life talking about this dumb shit maybe you see how stupid it was to include this in a freaking video. Good Lord man. Anyways usually like your videos. Nice job 👍
Bro. WHO CAARRREESSSS
The brand is called Arizona it never said it was made in Canada
those lamb chops and stace won’t make you look any more masculine
Shave
When u try too hard to look like tommy innit
Its an Arizona tea its the brand
They were played like the fiddle
Bro Arizona green tea is not made from Arizona it’s just the name of the drink
ARIZONA IS A TEA BRAND!!!!!!
The company can be American, but the factory can be in Canada
Food lies that always happen
Didn’t say made in Arizona, just says the company’s name is AriZona an American company.
Its made in the us, but maybe JUST maybe the can isn't, or vice versa I...know....shocking  take your time to process it
ALGUIEN QUE HABE ESPAÑOL😅😋💅
Bro got the founding fathers side burns 😭😭😭
Bruh I can’t believe that mustache
Looks like a slave traders son from the 1830s
Not because the name of the drink is Arizona has to be made in arizona.coca cola it's not made with cola ..... right....
Mans facial hair tho
Bro you look like Jschlatt
If these people are our future then we are so fucked
The company name is "Arizona". 🤦‍♀️
The strawberry and blueberry one isn't a food lie he got what he paid for but got really unlucky
Guys slowly turning into wolverine
Arizona is the brand name
This is what i imagine tiktokers/youtube short people that do these kind of facts content looks like...
How can these videos be enjoyable lmao 😂 y’all are some wierdo ass sheep! Just followers. Disliked
Acually "AriZona" is a name of a company so u can't complain
The last one is good strawberries are so fire
Arizona is the Damn brand.
Please go get a job
Bröther.... SHAVE
Bruh the brand is Arizona
Given that strawberries are more delicious than blueberries, I’m okay with that. And “Arizona”? Really?? How stupid is this kid? 😂
Arizona is the brand 🤣👏
Broski…shave that shit off your face
The brand is just called Arizona
I can't look at this face. I don't ever want to see it again. Plus his content is trite.
This guy is the ultimate bri'ish definition of "got some ciggies mate?"
My dude wants some schlatt facial hair
it never said it was made in arizona. thats the name of the drink brand
Bro, the Arizona one is a lie. It's called "Arizona Tea" cause the tea is from Arizona I think. So yeah stop the cap lmao
Bro arizona is a drink
They ain’t mutton chops those are just long sideburns and a pedo tash
If I bought that sandwich, best believe someone's getting shot.
Que no se preocupe en 5 años sale en el 5 y hasta con estreno
Discount Schlatt
U sound like mark from rdcworld 😂
Fix your face!
What's up jschlatt
bro looks like tommy innit and jschlatt but worse
He deffo hangs around schools and twiddles his weak moustache.
Fun fact: He is a werewolf
Bootleg tommyinit
I feel bad for the sandwich guy 😂😂
Real quick, Arizona tea is a style where you use the sun to heat up the water and make tea without using boiling water. 2nd strawberries cost more than blueberries so that's actually a win
Arizona is not made in Arizona surprised
1822 called, they want their fuzz back.
Your beard please shave no hate
I don't know about you but I don't give a f-ck where my food was made.  And I don't know how you think I won't believe these "fOoD LiEs" because you literally show pictures.
Arizona tea is an American company. Product of Canada is the can.
What are you doing?
Bro that haircut/mustache is fire bro 😂
Why do they all speak like this-
What's up with all the unnecessary hate? Ya'll need to grow up, making fun of people ain't cool
..... dude, Arizona is the name of the brand. It's an AMERICAN brand but it's packaging is from canada.  That's also an Albertson's fruit container. It's all made with fresh fruit and the probably just ran out of blueberries. It happens alot. It's all filled by hand.
Bro give up
Nice beard dude
So dam pointless
You look like logan from the x men hh
0/0
Child: Mom can we get a jschlatt?  Mom: we already have one at home The "jSchLatT"
Dude your fckng beard
For the sandwich he didn't get played, those types of sandwiches are front loaded to make them look fuller and go by weight. The second one "Arizona"(the company name) "an American company" (clearly telling you that the company is American not that the product is made in America), therefore explaining the "product of canada" part.
The can didn't say it was made in Arizona or in American it said the company is an American company.
Stawberrys > blueberrys
Beards that never grew out!!! He only had 25% of his beard grown in 😂🤣
Bruh it's called Arizona soda, not made in Arizona
God this bizarre man child with face frizz looks 11 years d
Only the company was American, that doesn’t mean the product itself was made in America. They make the products elsewhere.
Waht a Beard 😅
Please stop it, get some help
Nigga shave yo shit
Bro if tommyinnit and Jschlatt had a baby
The brand is Arizona we have those here idk if it’s the brand or whatever but it’s not meant to symbolize where it’s from but a label of sorts
I believe it all except how he goes out cos playing wolverine
So the first is a scam, but not a lie, you could have checked the ingredients or nutritional value. On the second, while the product was created in Arizona, it was manufactured in Canada. Third is just bullshit but you could have at least seen it
The biggest lie here is that pathetic stub of a moustache from wish 😭
You growing a beard
Get rid of the face hair dude!
I can’t imagine making “content” like this and not legitimately hating myself
Bye😐
This guy's face 🤣
Discount Jschlatt
🥴
When U Mix Tommyinnit and Jschlatt ...
Arizona is the company not the place it's made in
Ebay tommy innit

Why u look like schaltt
The can was probably made in Canada not the drink itself.
WTF dude
