it stu on the phone
I'm not feeling the new mask in Scream 7 Trailer. It's looks too small. The eyes are too small. Compare it to the mask in this Trailer. The mask is so much better. The shape, and size is perfect.  Stuff like this bothers me. The Scream 7 mask looks like the cheap version you buy in some Halloween stores.
Scream 7 2026 🔥
PÂNICO 7 - DIA 26 DE FEVEREIRO,2026,  NOS CINEMAS 🎥🩸🚩📌📍
I remember where I was when this trailer came out   I knew my cousin watched Scream 4 when I was 3 or 4 years old I thought this trailer looked cool and I thought I didn’t need to watch the other ones because it looked like a reboot sequel since it’s a new generation of the franchise which means a new start to it while also dealing with previous characters and that’s how I got in the franchise! I was 13 when it came out in theaters, it was my first R-Rated movie that I’ve watched on the big screen and my first ever scream movie! I loved Dewey, Sam, Richie, Amber and Sidney and it was a great experience! My mom got a little mad at me for picking something so violent then other horror movie but we loved it and I wasn’t expecting that opening to be so brutal 😭😭😭  But I didn’t come a full fan until the 6th film and lowkey I don’t think this franchise became so brutally violent until the 4th film, but 5th and 6th that was a BLOODBATH
Dewey's death 😢
I love Tara
“I’m Sidney Prescott of course I have a gun” had me laughing on the floor bc that’s real af 😂
Me
Why did YouTube notify me this 4 years later
Scream 5 was actually alright...Brought the franshine back. But had some really annoying moments with mindy...And didn't care if a single character died...other then Dewey. But it's way...way better then Scream 6. If you a fan of Scream 6...you're not a real Scream fan. Glad Scream 7 looks like a return to form.
Who else is here after the scream 7 trailer?
GIRLS HAPPY HALLOWEEN BABE!! 😉
What a boring, crappy movie 😂😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴. Dumb, dumber,dumbest,...
SCREAM 2022 OFFICIAL TRAILER Jenna Ortega 🔪 albertpanuelo as Terra
Scream 5 was a great refresh to the franchise!
Rewatching all the trailers since the new one dropped
They should have just called this "Scream 5". it doesn't make sense to go back numbering the films after this one.
*Truly* wish Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega didn't leave the franchise
Who's here after Scream 7 Trailer?
who’s here after the Scream 7 trailer?
bro just take off the mask and see who it is
Scream 2022 official trailer Jenna Ortega 🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
I think Amber was the best Scream killer
i get recommended SCREAM 5 trailer....but not SCREAM 7's trailer. they should release it around late October but still. tired of waiting.
Oh no wandinha!
Scream 2022 official trailer
1:46 did they spoil Dewey’s death? I know they didn’t show it, but the way it’s shot makes it seem like he dies.

I will never watch this movies on theatre pu*sy i*raily  follower
Scream 2022 official trailer ❤🎉
It was so much better than Scream 6. It started really well, but man I wish that 6th part didnt exist.
Stu was going to be in scream 5 and we see him in the car looking at something but we don't know what and why did they cut out the clip of stu in the car for this movie feels like Stu was going to be in the movie but they cut him out of the movie but we all don't know why. 🤔
Am going to see it again ❤
This movie was so bad ....I don know why the trailer has Soo much views
To Bad The Movie Sucked
❤
Why I’m getting this on my recommended?😭 I thought this was 7 for a sec😅
lol i cant believe they show both of the killer’s deaths
After watching this movie the trailer is very misleading.
This is why I don’t watch trailers to horror movies I want to see. They show you EVERYTHING and ruin it all before you see it!
Guys, I’m gonna be in scream7
First comment in five days
The automatic door unlocker was so iconic, I miss experiencing his trailer for the first time
😀 123 🔪 🔪 🔪
I have started this movie at 11:50 am today
Hello Sidney it’s an honor # a great way of honoring the iconic franchise
Happy birthday  And watch out about the killer
Who is Watching Here This 2025?
هزارتو 0:08
2:02 spoiled who the killer was by accident
2:08 2:09
2:08 hello ❤💙
0:28 I'm the next scream guy better than Ethan landry 😂😂😂😂😂😂
0:02 why message makes that sound😂
When i first saw this at @ 0:53 i thought it was going to be a Repeat of Drew Barrymore (Killing Off Another adored A-List Star before the Movie Begins lol).
Another video just told me this trailer shows who the killer is and I see it.
I'm calling it "Scream 5" no matter what that title says.
I think one of the killers in this movie was obvious just by looking at the cast list (jack quaid) and seeing at the beginning of the movie he was the boyfriend of one  of the movies main characters BTW I'm still waiting for the return of stu macher, fingers crossed 🤞 for the next scream
March 24, 2025      Movies and TV shows that are made in the Carolinas have a special meaning for me, and Scream V is a strong return to the roots of the franchise  RIP Wes Craven August 2, 1939 August 20, 2015🕊🤍
I thought Friends was cancelled!
I remember seeing this trailer and when the beginning of the trailer, I was like "A remake to the franchise? I'll pass" but when I see Sydney and Gale on it, and I was like "Oh, they're back after the fourth. I'm happy now!".
The Scream killer is a crazy man and murderer in real life and he's wanted by the Police in real life cause he goes around and kills people in real life
俺も大好きなホラー映画『 ハロウィン 』『 13日の金曜日 』『 エルム街の悪夢 』『 スクリーム 』がめちゃくちゃ大好き大ファンです！✨✨✨😢
And the Oscar goes to … Mikey Madison 👏👏👏👏
Is this scream three?
It should’ve been called Scream 5
Bro Ghostface sounds like hot daddy😂💩👌
This was recommended to me during the Super Bowl and I immediately thought we got some new content
(The Scream Franchise Is By Far My Favorite Horror Series Because It's So Meta And Realistic)
I’m sorry but the acting by most of the young cast was so bad especially the Sam character! Neve, Courtney, and Dewey were great as always though
It's An HONOR #S7
It's all systems armed  and the voice wad not like that
We need Mortal Kombat Characters to save this dimension.
🗣️👻3 year anniversary. Love this franchise and its rebirth
Happy 3 Year's everyone.
Any else only here because of The Healing??
we need scream 6
This movie sucks 😂
Ok but how was this 3 years ago?
do you like or Would you like??
this movie is the 5th sequel right?
https://youtu.be/yeZ3_54fJNA?si=DkfwmntNypzCkoSD
Excited to continue my Marathon.
Tv shows don’t make phsyco killers… CANCELLING TV SHOWS DOES
this is not scary 😂  but if i am scared come to my house
What scream movie is this?
I preferred the andrew tate version
This is scream 5 one of the new generation Scream dedicated to Wes Craven 🖖🏽
What's your favourite scary movie ?
Un lucky for that first victim 🤡
Is this inappropriate I am trying to figure out if it is before I watch it
🥺🥺WAS HELLA G00D🥺🥺
The real terror is the modern world. I would never have  phone app  door Lock technology. I guess I’m just old-school.
There’s just so much nepotism in this movie that it distracts from the art from Cuba Gooden Jr. son to Meg Ryan’s and Dennis Quaids son it’s just ruining the industry. They really should be laws against this in terms of Casting. It’s too much especially when there’s 160,000 actors in screen actors guild and the industry is just planting offspring as leads and taking parts away from, talented perspectives who are dues paying members.
This was one of the most cringe movies I've ever seen. It's ALL just one-liners and terrible story. I'm not gonna be biased and lie
This movie was awful and how could anyone like it. After they left Dewey alone with the killer I had to cut that crap off. 0/10
No, not Sam’s sister 0:49 😭😭😭😭😭
Fckin awesome movie... 🔥 15 oct 2024
WHY, OUT OF ALL THE OPTIONS SHE HAD, WOULD TERRA RUN FOR THE FRONT FREAKIN DOOR!? LIKE EVEN FOR HORROR LOGIC THAT'S STUPID!
I like how in the trailer, syndey looks like the main character when in the movie she only appeared at the final act
I ve never laughed this much 😂guys its ridiculous.. i recommend it it really need to laugh. Nothing makes sense  I cant believe the comments 😅
0:32 Who wants a house like that😂?
This Trailer is super nostalgic, Whos here in 2024??
This is worst one...sucked.
Ahloa I’m shanebearddj I Love ❤️ These Movies
It had the 5th too but missing parts like someone in P
1:41
😮
Jenna Ortega best final girl. 😊
I have seen this movie at 6:50 pm today
I didn't like it for one reason: it is presented as a more imaginary film and not as a live film and that makes it boring
sri ramchandra roddam
shambhavi sarasvati and sriamritanandmayi maa and sri anandamyi maa
This movie sucked!!…..just another M-she-U movie
ha ha.. what a silly movie... each one with stab in their abdomen and they can walk like nothing happened.... half burned and still alive...  never seen such a silly and stupid English movie... wonder if Director worked in bollywood.
Jenna ortegaaa?!
who's still inlove with this trailer?! still watching 2024!!
Just saw this movie.  Wish u seen it in the theaters. Great movie
They basically showed that chad died, but he survived later
Was this one better than part 6 ?
❤
And to the one who played Sydney I'm so sorry
Everyone that worked on the scream franchise I know you've been hurt too, it did make me less afraid though cause I was experiencing stuff like this
This is why I could never be a movie killer. Killing people is one thing, but getting someone they knows phone, having an entire conversation with them while pretending to be that person, going out and getting the costume, stalking them enough to know when they'll be alone so I can have it all time out right? Way too much work.
ShadowDays | Official Trailer (2022 Movie)
Mixed race cast everywhere in this movie.
Neve Campbell is the Natalie Nunn of Scream. She's gotten way too old to be in this franchise. 🤨
Watching this on Hulu as I'm commenting.
I'm glad that Paramount actually brought back scream
I took my STAB (pun, unfortunately, intended) at a Scream 2 trailer.  Going old school for this one!  https://youtu.be/GbuD6_P_EKY?si=w3Es-rg3zmBEwt8W
❤
I. Love.   Janna ❤❤❤❤
2 years already since it came out!?
🍕🍕🍕 🍕🍕🍕
The killer is Richie and amber
Shouldve stopt after the original. What a load of crap..
Scream 5 has no purpose. Why didn’t they tear down and burn the ground of stew‘s house and Billy‘s house and all the other people who killed and all of the scream franchises or the stab franchises?? Stuff like this should be burned all the history, so it doesn’t give people ideas of what to do next the first sign of mental illness needs to be addressed or dealt with. five never happened they should’ve just skipped scream five and scream six past you got the twins that was a relative to you the daughter that was a relative in the screen one scream makes sense scream five does not
Jésus Christ !!!! This FK movie so boring, dialogue is horrible.
Fear
One heck of a movie. Totally screamed all the way
i saw the cast of this movie and immediately brush it off
Dumb  movie
Scream 1 is best movie
Amazing part scream 6
Movie name please
RAEFLLA🎉🎉🎉
2:05
In today's day, it's hard to believe that a guy in a ghost mask and black rob can go around stabbing people without getting caught on camera. That's why this movie sucked in my opinion.
bro i spent my whole night watching scream 2022 and scream 6 beast of movies now i have to say its  my first stab movies so i really like them even if they are 2 hours long rip jenna cause she left scream 7
Incomparable avec les vrai films des tueurs en série zodiac seven ....on dirait des zinzins de l'espace
Probably this is the worst movie  i've ever seen in my life
JUSTICE 4 MELISSA.  JUSTICE 4 MELISSA.  JUSTICE 4 MELISSA.  JUSTICE 4 MELISSA.  JUSTICE 4 MELISSA.  JUSTICE 4 MELISSA.  JUSTICE 4 MELISSA.  JUSTICE 4 MELISSA.  JUSTICE 4 MELISSA.  JUSTICE 4 MELISSA.  JUSTICE 4 MELISSA.
Shame on you Matt Bettinelli and Tyler Gillett for bringing back the slasher film back after so many years that too in a trashy version. I mean Sam and Tara Carpenter, Chad and Mindy as main characters is utterly nonsense. Sam as Billy Lomis's daughter and Chad and Mindy as Randy Meek's nephew and niece too bad. Adding new characters and storyline, killing of Dewey Riley, it's tooooooooooo much. Worst film ever.😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Great cast
*JUSTICE FOR MELISSA BARRERA*
They’re so dumb firing Melissa Barrera for her based comments on Israel-Palestine... If they don’t bring her back I ain’t watching any new ones. 🤷‍♂️
I Love Jenna Ortega So Much
Just watched this and to me, it was a little hokey, but I loved how Sidney and Gale came in like the OG's they are and helped save the day ❤
JUST FINISHED WATCHING THIS ON NETFLIX. MOST ridiculous  PLOT EVER!
had it figured in the first few minutes, still ok, though.  not a fan of some of the deaths or incredibly stupid protagonists.  btw, is a gf mask made of kevlar these days?  seems that way.
Now its on Netflix, i kinda liked this one
I finished watching this yesterday, and I absolutely loved it! It was just as entertaining as the first Scream film! I am super excited to see Scream 6 now!!!
الفيلم ابو كلب
HAPPY 2 YEAR ANNIVERSARY SINCE THIS TRAILER CAME OUT!!!! 🔪🩸
I just realized the girl who gets shot then set on fire was the same girl who was in Quentin Tarantinos Once Apon A Time In Hollywood and she practically dies the same way. I found that pretty funny.
Crazy scene in the hospital makes his costume look sick
I am here Just for  jenaortega ...#wednesday# monica
I never got to see this movie or the new one . Big regrets 😢
This version was like an “after school special” with violence.
THIS WAS TJE BEST 1 EXEPT FOR SCREAM 6
yaur
I may have missed something, but how does this work? In this movie "Scream" they keep referring to their actual real life pasts as a movie franchise called "Stab" ? They keep referencing the movie "Stab" Which we all know is actually an alias for "Scream" but they are actually the real life characters referring to their past as a movie franchise called "Stab"  What's going on here ?
Yes I scream but not from fear but from boring!!!!!!!!
It sucked
Jenna Ortega and Mikey Madison did amazing best scream movie imo
Is this movie supposed to be horror or thriller?  Felt funny and stupid to me. Waste of precious time
Scream : *Dewey's Last Blood*
Tell me the names of the SMS sounds in her phone at the beginning
BIG FAN
15 months ago 😢
I thought hes name was scream but no his name is ghostface
I missed Sidney in the 6th one
A Halloween Movie So Scared For me to watch scream
I love the actors but this is one of the cheesiest movies. Ever. Worst time spent 😂😂😂😂
SCREAM 5 2022 Is a Perfect Movie Film and it was                                                                                                                                           Only In Theaters January 14, 2022. Ghost Face says Do You Like Scary Movies?  This Movie is 5/5
I think it is Halloween Friday the 13 Nightmare on Elm street and Scream but for Horror movies who aren’t a franchise “IT”
This is a remake of the 1996 classic
I’m a kid
😮first Scream I have ever watched, this was scary
Was Tara unlocking the doors or were they opening by themselves?
I have seen bad movies but this one is the worst movie ever 😂😂😂
oh great.. another woke movie. no, ty.
I love this movie
Scream>>>
Bring back Jill!!! Craven said he wanted her fate open, she twitched a little at her death scene 😊
One of the best and funnies 😂😂😂😂❤❤
It was boring..not thrilled lack of driecton
What an utter waste of time what kind of movie was this
did anybody else also guess the killer in the first half an hour?
Man when I first saw Tara getting stabbed many times it made me shiver and made me feel bad. She probably was horrified
Ah yes, a Requel of Scream.
Do do do… OMGAAAWD
I've finally seen it today
I miss her ❤ and movie
This is the first Scream movie I watched and finished it. I love the twists cause I had no idea from past Scream movie. I like Amber and Wes here.
Monica geller ❤
I'll be right back is such an iconic line
Oh you think I’m a joke
I sense a great disturbance in the force now.
dylan minnetre 1!!
Hi I want to watch scream but I don’t understand what’s the first movie🥲 is it this one by any chance?💀
Man that has changed there are way better scarier horror movies made in the late 2000’s
🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎬🎥🎥🎥📷📷📷📷📷📷
OK, this movie was horrible. I felt this is the worst of the franchise. The killers we’re very predictable, and the actors were absolutely horrible. I felt the actors were all competing to see who could be more diverse or the most WOKE rather than the acting . It was pretty ridiculous. Don’t waste your time. Go rewatch the first 3 and call it a day. **Spoiler Below** And the fact that that emo chick, who was one of the killers actually killed Dewey was absolutely not believable at all. Not to mention the fact that she was also shot five times. I’m a horrible movie fair and I can understand that you need to Reality of it but this was ridiculous. NOTHING BUT A CASH GRAB. its a one big ad for the I Phone, F this F that. the 25 and under crowd will love it!
Story me logic bhi nahi he & Tenson buildup bhi Nahi he, Khali Althu Faltu Sceen murder Chalrahi he, Overall ea Ek Bekar 😡movie👎
😝Bekar movie, Story me kuch Logic nahi he👎👎
I love how they made the trailer. At first it seemed like this movie was gonna be centered around the original cast but after watching this you know it's centered around Sam and Tara but still includes the original Scream cast in a not too overpowering way
What a movie! Comparing this movie to halloween kills, I definitely have to say scream 5 topped it. While yes halloween kills did have plenty of gore, this movie did too but each scene had a twist and that gave me goosebumps while I was watching
After watching Wednesday its weird to see Jenna scared. Wednesday would have scared him to death herself
You can only make so many lol
Sam❤️ were outstanding in the movie!!
ها
MEGAN  Scream l Trailer  2022 Movie big fan
I don’t get it. Why didn’t they title it “ scream 5”?
i miss scream
If I spelt it, right
BRO I think That is Jenna Ortega.
This entire trailer is just awful 😆
The legend is back
hitler
Scream 5 is better than scream 6 tbh
i am sidney prescott of course i have a gun
Hope for Scream 6 release soon... Im done with all of them tonight.  This one was absolute ok. Amazing that the original cast is in every one in. But sad one is gone. Jenna is way too hyped, she got here such a minor role, but that is absolute ok...
Timeless movies are awesome 😎
5 screams, all these deaths,  Courtney's extensive  plastic surgery, zero rapes and alwaysa a ghost face killer, whom might be black cause you know 2022 #blessed . So what does that tell us about the rules for survival?
This movie was genuinely scary and funny, as well as being a meta-commentary like the first one. Loved seeing the OGs back as well as the new cast. Liked the way the...land line! Yes! A land line!...was used to indicate danger and the clever way smartphones were integrated into the story to build tension. Well done.
Stabbed like 10 times and they’re still alive 😝
What’s a honor to be me or you
Then why you hiding behind me
There powerless around me
And he’s behind me
There the ones from the passion of the chirst
MORAL OF THE STORY: NEVER TRUST ON ANYBODY EITHER HE IS YOUR FRIEND OR SOMEONELSE .... MEANS NO ONE ...NO ONE
dewy already told sam not to trust on richie and the funny part she keep richie with her as her shadow but this shadoq also appears in night
Melissa, Jenna Ortega, the twins and Gale survive the killers is Richie family seeking revenge after his death, which is his brother(Chad roommate), sister(Melissa roommate) & father(the detective). Also Stu isn’t in this movie, hopefully the next one tho.
I never understood why they didn't keep the voice from the security system app in the version that came out. Between the two that voice added a little more suspense to the scene with Tara in the beginning.
Who is watching it before Scream 6 is released 😂❤ anyway Scream 6 I looks awesome
Best Scream since the first 👏 RIP Dewey 😭
wtf mindy jeezus
❤❤
ITS AN HONOR!  #S6
Did anyone come here from the healing
All the scream movies suck. Dude has on a mask with poor visibility  and it's a restrictive rob and all he has is knife.  All you have to do wait for him with a blunt object and put him to sleep.
She is wednesday
this movie is goin be way better then the sonic movie and bubble bee movie
Was really disappointed with this one. The trailer was so misleading when it said it was linked to the past and this one feels different. Because it wasnt?!
Terrible movie do not waste your time. How were they still alive at the end? Like "you got stabbed and shot here we'll give you a blanket"  🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
WAZAA
Actress on environment Cindy on enviroent aspects.
The deathflag in this for THAT character was quite subtle, and it came true in the movie. Compare this to the trailer for the entry that preceded it; the deathflag for a returning character there wasn't very subtle and it did NOT come true.       And that is why I don't think Mindy will die in Scream VI, she'll survive that attack on the subway.
i watched this one with my cousin and it is definitely an amazing movie! very thrilling and not too scary if you’re newer to scary movies or like not a big fan. the plot is good and i would recommend watching it
This looks really bad.
does anyone know where to watch this for free
How the hell did the first victim survive that attack.. totally lame 🤣
Trying to watch Gale Weathers act and it’s literally like watching Donald Duck try to emote.  What a fucking ridiculous set of life choices.  Plastic Surgeons who do shit like that should be sent down for life, and the people who choose the Melted Candle look need a slap!
Just watching this now.   Gail weathers has just showed up on the scene.   Oh my days! What a good representation of why people need to NOT get plastic surgery.  She looks horrendous.   Did she literally ask the surgeon for the hot new look, ‘Melted Candle’?
Love the fact at 1:55 they frame-teased the Macher house. How noone saw that is insane.
Love this
Show de filme 👏🏻 mandaram muito bem...Terror total.
I think this one is a remake scream
Ghost face: what's your favourite scary movie Me:will smith slaping Chris rock at the Oscars.
Loved this movie!!
The fact that we all thought that Jenna was gonna die. That's what made this movie interesting.
2:05
ka oa nga salida haha igo nlang pusilon ang kalaban d pa mabuhat hahaha
She born at Friday 13, and will fight with the Ghostface itself, coincidence? 🤣
This movie sucked.
this movie was actually trash bro💀please do better on scream 6, i better not get that cliche house killing again broo. literally trolling
RIP Wes Craven (August 2, 1939 – August 30, 2015), aged 76 You will be remembered as a legend.
david arquette? gross
Who's  here after Scream VI trailer
Looking back on how heavily they showcased Sidney I'm curious wow this one will do financially
Scream needs to be at the top of the horror genre! like the movies are actually consistent with being so good
A crap for poor demented people
Worst Scream to date. I get what they were going for but the writers bent too far in an attempt to be modern at the expense of the spirit of the franchise and beloved characters.
That looks like a Ka-Bar knife. The one Brian Kohberger used..
Happy 1st Anniversary "SCREAM 5" (JANUARY 14, 2022)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (R.I.P. WES CRAVEN)
Scream 5 is officially 1 year old!!! Still an amazing continuation of this series  The kills are still bloody, the humor still works, the meta commentary of recent horror remakes, sequels, reboots not being as good as the original is still reverent, there is also toxic fandom that affects Hollywood, they even make a funny joke about why this isn't called Scream 5 Plus the whole satire of continuing stories that shouldn't be finished and that Hollywood is fresh out of new material  One death in particular really got to me  I didn't find the score by Bryan Tyler all that memorable, I miss Marco Beltrami’s music  Who knows if this is the end for the main trio of actors and if they'll pass the torch? Moved by very fast for an hour and 54 min  I love how they put in a lot of nostalgia for the first movie but still does its own thing  Glad these new writers and directors try their best in honor of the late Wes Craven and what he started back in 1996  Movie 6 opens in 2 months omg😁
Wazzzzupppp
I just wanted to watch this full movie, I only watched half I need to understand the outcome of the characters, I felt sorry for Tara (Jenna Ortega)😔😱🔪🩸
Jenna ortega ♥♥♥♥
Masterpiece !yesterday I watch this movie and become my fav movie .Absolutely Masterpiece 👀
Compared to the Wednesday Netflix series, Jenna ortega looks so different in this movie.
Nobody asked for that anticlimactic music
Hi I want to act this movie can I please answering my comment.
Is it Wednesday adams ... The girl?
Best. Remake. Ever.
i was on this game healing and like this link 'cant wait' i clicked and im on this
it’s not bad but Scream 4 is still a lot better.
Omggg exciting
Just watched it, can’t believe how Sidney and Brooke Davis from one tree hill (Sophia bush) look sooo much alike !!
She knows
The start of the film has so many hints that you only pick up on after viewing once. Worth 2 watches at least.
How dare he kill Jenna?🤬🤬🤬
Ghostface going crazy 🤪 😜  https://youtu.be/6BeMx4y8Bg8
wow monica i thought u just stayed on friends
I know what you Screamed last summer on Halloween, Friday the 13th at Elm Street.
Seen in: Halloween Kills The Last Duel  Dune (select prints)  Last Night in Soho  Ghostbusters: Afterlife (select prints) King Richard  House of Gucci  Nightmare Alley  Licorice Pizza
Tara from Brawl stars 💀💀💀
“I’m Sydney Prescott of course I have a gun” YES QUEEN SLAY.
It’s my favorite casting in a movie.
Share links plz or upload this movie
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 mantık hataları ile dolu bir film. "1 star"
It was great I loved this movie so much! Can’t wait for 6!!!
Anyone who enjoys a sick movie glorifying crime, or promoting crime, have a sick mind themselves.  You should boycott this type of movie and stick with comedies and historical documentaries, to learn things, instead of polluting you mind by enjoying crime as entertainment.  If you like this kind of movie, you should be in a mental institution.  You will not make it into the Kingdom of God when Jesus takes over the planet to save us from nuclear war and crime.  You should only enjoy pleasant things, but instead you think of crime and killing as entertainment.  Maybe the killer of the four University of Idaho students saw this movie and decided to do it for real.
I remember when I saw this in theatres.  Was amazing.   poor Dewey :(
please let this be as good as we want it to be
I feel like Jenna Ortega is perfect for this role and for the Scary Movie spoof that will inevitably follow.  I'm obsessed with her after Wednesday.  Put her in everything and get weird & meta with it internet / hollywood.
so Jenna is only in the 1st scene? that stinks she should have been Sidneys daughter and the killer get her mother in the beginning
Them bringing back the OGs is awesome!! Sorry but the old generation just does it better 🤷🏻‍♀️
nie straszne troche kupa malo jeny nie polecam trochje nie oddaje filjm
Can’t any else believe its almost Inna been a year!!?
there is something about teens and horror that just doesnt work anymore... im glad to see courtney cox and jenna in it tho...
1:02 "I'm Sidney Prescott, ofcourse I have a gun"  Yes, Sidney!
Since the trailer was released in December last year, I've noticed someone   Jack Quaid (Hughie from The Boys) is in the new Scream
this movie was fucking dogshit
Hello sidney .....whats u r fav scary movie?😈
Please let this be as good as I want it to be
You like Scream 5
Ok
Now it’s gonna be like Halloween 😂😜until Sidney become like 100 he will not stop
THE BEST!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
My favorite horror movie scream 1
I didn't like the 2nd half but still it was a nice movie
For some reason, I think that Tara and Sam's mother could be the blond cheerleader who was trashing Sidney in the school bathroom.
wednesday♡
Including it and chide play.
The new scary movie looks great 😂
I only liked the first scream , but this actually looks pretty good
NOO WEDNESDAY:(((
Ngl this I didn’t find this movie that great. The fact Ghostface failed to kill a bunch of the people they attacked is a bit stupid, and I kind of think the motive was a little stupid. Gonna need a second watch to refine my opinions, but Wes Craven’s absence is definitely noticeable
The legend “ Scream “               Hello Sydney
Anyone who enjoyed this crap is a nonce.
Wednesday is here😂
Ghostface is back! Hasn't been seen in over a decade and he always comes back to surprise us.  Billy Loomis is the reason why horror fanatics turn into psycho killers because he was the one who started it all.
This is a joke, what a nonsense movie, it's not just time pass, lol movie😂😂😂
Yes 13th Halloween Friday scream good No not best love cast
Love a good scream ❤️ lolz and horror games and horror movies n series
Can I find and watch on Netflix? How many series althogether?
I couldn’t handle the screaming. Glad they all died.
It would be so cool if Marzia told you a  recipe a step-by-step in Italian and you had to follow it’s
“BAM—the bitch goes down!” has been replaced by “Wait, what about my ending?” “Here-it-COMES.” Two more movies and they’ll be at SCREAM 10…
I love the movie, brings back the memories a good recuel xd
yooo jenna ortega is dead

Just stop with these horrible corny remake/reboots, sooo weak and predictable, they just suck!! Even the millennial crowd doesn’t understand,
Isnt happy with the food
All we need is Sarah Connor...
it was really good!
One of my favorite movies of the year, but man this trailer was ass
MAJOR SPOILERS: 🍿  I liked the movie. Amber was intense, I'd say the most psychopathic since Billy! But the suspense and dread and character background/development just wasn't there; I feel as though Kevin not writing/producing played apart in the poorer character arches. 6.5/10 C+. I'd rank them as S1(10/10) 2ND Place- S2 (7/10 B) 3rd S3 (7/10) 4th S4 (7/10) 5th S5 (6.5/10) then 6th TV Show (6.5/10). I did read online it was Kevins idea to bring back Jill and isolate Sid; I think we'll see that in part 6 because Neve reportedly isn't returning. I still say it's ok to replace Neve as Sid! I also would've loved to see Dewey go out/down as the killer, because he definitely had motive. I loved how Ritchie hinted at Dewey having motive. 👻 🔪
I loved this movie, awesome movie lol. ghost face was clumsy af as well.
Bad acting
This is the rubbish movie at the end of this movie there are two phco killers one of tiny cute girl and other one is Sam's boyfriend but in hospital scene I observed that a tiny little sweet girl killed the retired police man with the two knives from front and back and grabbed him up I wondered at the end how is that possible seriously it's trash
10/2 very weak
i know how manifest ghostface killer and also i know how become ghostface get his costume never get caught and get his powers i am serious
In the game I'm playing the i r l to this video is on there
Çığlık REİZ
why did she open the door.  thts what i want to ask
They really nailed this trailer.
That's why iot sucks
It is have on Netflix?
Jack Quaid remind of Dan Reynolds
this gave me so many nostalgic memories for some reason lmaoo
telenovelas Siempre tuya Acapulco (2013), Tanto amor (2015), and the Netflix series Club de Cuervos (2017) Mellisa should have stayed at those movies literally dogshit😭
First horror movie that I'm not scared of
Bruh what’s Hughie doin here
Would you like to play a game???? He is not jigsaw He is ghost Face Where the f*ck is the line Whats you favourite scary movie???
Sid still looks cuteeee ❤🙏🏾
So glad to be alive when good things like this movie happen to the world
It was definitely a scary movie but had no logic. (Spoiler allert!) the murderer were human beings, was it this impossible for the police to identify who they were?they attacked in a hospital. Is there no cctv cam there? If the villains were ghost than I could say that the cctv or other things that can help find a criminal was not helpful.
The end films
Absolute dog shit
The next scream or any scary movie. Billy from stranger things needs to be in it and  the girls from pretty little liars
1 year LATER... WHO'S Ready to SCREAM ! !
Imagine Ghost face comes in halloween And take revenge for Myers death
I don't like horror/scary movies in general, but I really love the Scream franchise because a lot of my favourite actors and actresses in them.
On the other new scream can you make other monsters that are very scary that are like killers? PLS? So that it will be more interesting and more horror like.
Should I watch it even tho I'm 10 years old
It's always someone you know 🔪
Why couldn't it be around Halloween like what the heck??
Saw the first one in middle school  That's hw old I am
Got emotional about Dewey n then when the killer said it's a Honor .  Holyshit I got chills
2:05 hi sydney, great to see you
You can tell this wasn't filmed in California because the mayonnaise in the refrigerator is labeled Hellmann's
I think amber is killer
Mas Ganda to kesa jeepers creepers
Would you lock your doors with a phone?
What a load of 💩 original was good bit this is terrible
kokotina
The trailer for Scream !! will ALLEGEDLY be released sometime this month. Can’t wait 🎃🔪🩸👻
The underrated horror icon
Sidney should've just dropped a pallet...or just did a 360 into a dead hard...idk, just my thoughts!
Nice bro🤩
Umm... Why wouldn't they figure out how to release this by halloween? Seems like a pretty major mistake to make Paramount.
i'd like to play a game with tara, amber and samantha, if you catch my drift. lol. and scream will never be the same after scary movie(s). they literally ruined all of these movies for me
to the producer: get a life and be realistic Mr clown!
Film is shit. So stupid😑 how many times is he going to fall over when a drip or item that weights like 2 kg max  is pushed in ghost face's direction. Wwe I's more realistic ffs
GIRLS I LOVE WHEN U SCREAM FOR ME BABE!! 😉
I give this movie a 7.5 out of 10 just got done watching it and I love seeing the reunited cast members from the older scream movies and I think the first scream will always be the best
This movie is so good.
Scary movie 2000 is still best
What's your favourite scary movie Mine ---- scary movie 2000
This movie ruined avoiding trailers for me. This is exactly why if you like a franchise you might want to at least check parts of the trailer. I would’ve probably avoided seeing the movie had I saw the trailer.
This mowie is stupid.  For Child.  In  one moment when possible killer been kiled ...sherif make a stupid decisions and not kill killer to the end .
Idgi this is like the 7th scream what could be new or different? Are people really just watching the same movie over again and saying "I loved it how special this is to wes Cravens memory" lmfao?
coco
A remake? Come on man there was nothing wrong with the original. They should have left this one alone it was perfect the way it was! I'm so sick of remakes on classics.
Ready with my popcorn 🍿cause its Halloween month yoooo❤
Sooo Wes Craven is the voice of Ghostface, right? That’s rhetorical. He does a great job 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

WHEN A STRANGER CALLS THROUGH YOUR NEST CAM.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqEnzsggHrU
😂😂😂😂
The other Scream movies where in houses so you can understand why no one was really around to help.  But….. this one is in a hospital. Where are the other patients, doctors or nurses? Just the (1) killer and the victims are in the whole entire hospital at night is ridiculous. Their are always patients and staff 24/7 I don’t care how small the town is. Then in the day time the hospital is full again with patients and staff.   Leave the franchise alone. Noooooo more Scream movies let it go. The story lines are stupid 😒
The worst movie I have ever seen. I regret paying $4 bucks to watch it!
THE LEGEND!
The only scary thing about this movie was the acting. It was painful trying to watch. Each installment gets worse and worse...Just let it go.
Should of left it at the original scream  Nobody knew anything then and the 2 killers was a genius idea because one always had an alibi and kept the viewers guessing  Once that cat is let out the bag future movies are rubbish and predictable  This one was actually embarrassing how blatantly obvious they made it that richie was the killer  Like 10 mins in you know its him, then they 100% confirm it when they cut straight to him right after the 1st death so the viewer thinks it can't be him because he is elsewhere 🙄  Literally just a copy of the 1st film 💤💤  Embarrassing really
Embarrassing how blatantly obvious who the killer was 10 mins into the film  Didnt even try and hide it. I was waiting on the twist on it not being him thinking they couldn't make it that obvious but I forgot its a dumb movie  They were that obvious 😂
How am I only finding out about this movie just now???
SCREAM 6 TRAILER: Can we please NOT spoiler Scream 6 with a trailer like this again! It showed you nearly every kill... it should you Sam attacking (bleep) which meant you know who the killer was...
Always trying to be funny, hollywood 🙏.
Do I need to watch the earlier movies to watch this?
Love it!
What an absolute load of trash. This was the worst of the bunch.  2 hours of my life wasted on this shit. Just stop! Please!
Me watching the trailer due to hugh campbell
Cool
The black guy dies even in the trailer 😂
https://youtu.be/beToTslH17s898101+yå+dejaboo+^
It's a mistake to bring back the original stars of these films to try and tie this latest installment onto the original films. Instead of making this "the next chapter in a terrifying saga" they should have done a true reboot and cast entirely new actors. Plus it gets rid of those annoying nostalgia easter eggs no one cares about.
Home Security Ads should be like this.
i cant take this movie seriously because of scary movies 1
Im a fan of ghost face and even i want to costume him to this Halloween coming next month
Piece or crap like all other parts
I GET CHILLS EVERY TIME WHEN HE SAYS "hello sidney" FUCK
This is so bad and boring, I can't even really put it in words. Pathetic.
Holy shit 💀
Boring 🙄
couldn’t even get his signature line right, they used jigsaws signature line instead 😭😭
This was a good film all in all
I saw same type of movie but the victim is Deaf and Can't able to talk...can anybody tell me movie name if you saw that movie?
This movie is stupid af
Man Courtney Cox... why can't people in Hollywood just age the rite way? All tht stuff they do to there faces looks WAAY worse. Hollywood is like another planet, so out of touch forreal, they actually believe tht carving up themselves (most of them OBVIOUS carvings) looks good... how can that group of people be tht so unself aware? Pulling your skin back, poking, filling stuffing till it looks RIDICULOUS.!!! They do see themselves in a mirror I assume, and yet they see what they look like and go "Yep still got it I'm still young" ... I honestly feel bad 4em. And there is noway this one is that High on Rotten Tomatoes NOWAY thts very suspect 2say the least
WHY ALWAYS THE CHARACTER'S ARE SO ALWAYS S2PID! Fvvvck!!!!
Nobody wants to see another scream movie
This is a movie that should’ve just been a 1 and done. The first one was great…then they just dragged it on

Here's. Johnny..

Merci pour "The healing" de m'avoir mit sur cette vidéo 😂😂😂
The entire film was just meta references and rehashing the past movies. Because it was so samey and predictable I was genuinely wondering if I'd already rented it 6 months ago lol That was Scream 4 tho.
I enjoyed this but scream 4 is just as good
Give me chills seeing their faces I’m such a fan I love 💕
It’s good to see an older school franchise continue with the same actors and style as what they first started off with. Unlike a lot of others they went over bored or tried to make it this over the top new and improved but really it took away from the original style and that’s a lot of movies down falls when they try and continue a franchise but scream has always held a special place as one of my all time favs so I’m really happy to see that they are keeping it to its original form
I have wondered how the families of the victims of serial Killer Danny Rolling, The 'Gainesville Ripper', feel that the brutal murder of their loved ones inspired this.
Every time there's a movie or tv show making profits off a real life killer, money should go to the families of the killer's victims from the money these disgusting movies make

This movie was trash. One star is too high of a rating for this disaster.
Is that hughie?
Cool
They have gun and he has knife wtf?
For a second I forgot I watched this already and it blows big time.
same BS over and over again
Algum Brasileiro?
film is horrible.acting is bad.craven should resurrect himself as ghostface n kill all the cast members and pduction team.film is an insult to the og.sadly hollywoos has became bad in the last few years.pre 2000 films used to b magic,wonderful,thought provoking...
THIS MOVIE WAS FUCKIN HORRIBLE !!!
this movie was everything! can't wait for the return of ghostfsce next year 🔪❤️
Is it hard to make a descent movie without swearing words in each sentence ? This is so annoying
hell no me 😶😶😶
This movie ain't it
This is a very crappy, cliché, cheesy movie. It's just pathetic.
I KILLED EVERYONE HAHAHHAAHAH I STILL GOT IT IN ME I NEVER DIE
I JUST KILLED SO MUCH PEOPLE HAHAHHAHA
Ngl the movie pissed me off bc some characters seemed to have nevelcted the concept of common sense and half of them maybe would have lived ig they used their brains
Wow! the first kill is done like it was in the first scream from 1996.
Just watch this movie and I believe that it is the best one besides the original really enjoyed it!!!! Wes would have really enjoyed it and would have been so proud of everyone
On TikTok everyone thinks it’s Wes and now I understand why. Because they did not show him get scared/killed
*My new Texas Chainsaw Massacre film. 🤘**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4tw5txwggA*
great movie. enjoyed it alot can't wait til scream 6 march next year.
done watching THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING LIKE IM SPEECHLESS
WAZAAAAA
A terrible terrible film, saw it last night. Same old same old, please don't make anymore. Totally unrealistic and poor plot.
This is the best movie trailer for the "SCREAM" franchise. Sadly. I have not seen it though.

Daddy Ghost Face
Samara Weaving: OPENING KILL. She has found fame and fortune in faking surviving a Ghostface attack. RICH and FAMOUS. Lives with her husband. She's at home watching television where she receives a phone call from none other than Daddy Ghostface. He taunts her saying he knows her secret and she's a PHONY. An HOMAGE is paid to Casey/Tara where Weaving plays with a knife block but this time around, it's covered in BLOOD when she pulls it out. It's at this point where she watches her husband brutally murdered on their AMAZON SMART VIDEO DEVICE in the kitchen. She runs to help him out but he's already DEAD. Chase ensues and Weaving meets her DEMISE, but she pulls off the mask to reveal CHAD as the first GHOSTFACE. We know Chad is one of the killers throughout the entire movie. Weaving was the original choice for this scene and thankfully replaced D-lister Kiernan Shipka.   MOTIVE: Targeting all previous survivors of Ghostface attacks. Samantha has a big monologue at the end, stating how she's nothing like Billy Loomis and she is donning the Ghostface persona to end all future attacks. She is the only one who can protect her and the ones she loves and will do anything it takes to do so.   Mindy: DIES at the hand of Sam (Ghostface). Mirrors SMG's death scene in Scream 2. Chad will never kill or harm his sister and Samantha takes it upon herself to take care of her.   Three killers: Chad, Sam, Kirby. Kirby is the mastermind, paying homage to WILLIAMSON'S SCREAM 3 original SCRIPT, CULT OF STU MACHER/THE FOLLOWING.   Kirby only has one kill: Samantha. Kirby states that she thinks shes the Final Girl, but there is only one REAL Final Girl - SIDNEY FUCKING PRESCOTT. It's time Kirby pays a visit to an old friend & IDOL.  Epilogue: Kirby kills Kincaid in front of Sidney at their matrimonial home. It's brutal and vicious. Kirby escapes. This is when we see Sidney described in her most feral, vengeful moment. It's described as animalistic and nothing we have seen before in Sidney. She wants revenge for this. Now, it's personal. This sets up #Scream7, taking into account this film doesn't bomb.   #CancelScream6 #SidneyisScream #leaks #script #Scream6 #Scream2 #Scream2 #Scream!!
This movie didn’t had a good “Scream” Killer.I already knew he was the killer after he said to his girlfriend “I will be with you no matter what “ or whatever he says
This is probably the only scream movie that has idiot characters. When Dewey shot the killer why didnt he took of his masks so his identity will be revealed? And since they already knew the pattern that the killer is within the group of friends the police should just detained all of them to avoid more killings. And also police officers should roam around  their houses since all of them are suspects. Aghhhh they never learn.
i really enjoyed it in the movies and i got paramount plus (ew) just to watch it free with a Free Trial
Nothing Will beat The scream from 90s,this one can even came closer to the original
that shit looks ill as fuck
Lame, woke, lame, woke, laaaaaaame!
I saw this movie 🎥 but I realised this movie is comedy movie 🤣🤣🤣 the mask murderer man and women are back so you have to shot on his / her scull if not they will come back apart from that they are Terminator...😂😂😂
WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAA
*Don't click me if you're scared*
Looks only 50% woke that’s good
I love this movie
💕💕💕
Bakwas
Its that a remake or continueing?
Shitty and unrealistic movie don’t waste your time
This is easily one of the worse movies I’ve ever seen
I loved Scream 5 the best one since the original
Super cheesy i couldnt stand the first 10 minutes
I'm glad I bought this movie on blur ray.
Looking back I just kinda hate how this trailer spoiled what happened to dewie
Without Jack Quaid this movie would be pretty boring. He brought an aspect to the movie that made it very enjoyable.
I hate dumb characters
For everyone that’s saying it’s a rubbish movie it has great ratings I ❤️ the movie
what a shit movie
Did scream become jigsaw 😂
I thought this movie is Comedy but didn't expect the plot twist. More on brutal and the sound is fvxking annoying too much loud. I rate this movie of 8.5/10
Thanks anyway guys for your assistance soon let me know later this afternoon details maybe you could arrange
I enjoyed the first 90 minutes of Scream 2022.The last 15 minutes made no sense to me.After the two killers are revealed,most of the time they don’t use their guns they just walk around wasting time,waiting  for someone to jump out of nowhere and attack them.The girl gets shot and then she is set on fire and somehow survives and walks towards the people she is trying to kill with her eyes basically swollen shut.Very disappointing ending to this film.
DON'T WASTE UR TIME WATCHING THIS NOT-MAKE-SENSE MOVIE. THE HOSPITAL IS EMPTY AF LMAO NOT EVEN A SINGLE HUMAN BEING. I GUESS ALL OF THEM ARE OFFICE HOUR INCLUDING ALL THE PATIENCE 😂 THIS NEVER DESERVES TO HAVE A SEQUEL & EXIST
This was a bad movie lol
I actually want to watch this..:
Perhaps their safety precautions (the rules) made them magnets for Ghostface in the movie. Perhaps the danger level increased with their "smart" plans. Maybe someone who just accepted the reality of Ghostface & his games was much safer than they were.
monica will surely overpower that demon killer
Pero lo que no me gustó ...que el policía retirado muera en esta película .....al parecer screenn 6 ya no habrá
Worst film ever i seen
A405U Kronologi kejadian sebelumnya.
am i the only one who finds the killer sexy ?yes huh?ok bye
Total garbage. This film might do ok if it got entered in shitfest
I just watched it , wish I didn't,  it was unprofessional also more like comedy  and boring 😴 😕 😐
Shout out to Mason Gooding for being his own man having Cuba as a dad. He actually CARRIED the satire in this movie, Hilarious quotes like “Probably time to introduce him to Hobbs & Shaw” & “well this is how I mourn & distract myself from the looming specter of death” 😂😂💀🤣🤣🫣

Personally, I wouldnt let that slide 🤷‍♂
This horror movie
?
wasssssaaaappp😋
Wow💖
I want scream 6 to be very different I enjoyed this one tho ❤️
A horrible scene from film scream https://youtu.be/VGCBe1t33-M
I’m watching it rn   man this is utter garbage
Best smart home tech but still uses a landline :) :) :)
Y el desnudo de Neve Campbell?
This movie gave everything I love in a Scream film. Gory kills,fun meta commentary, excellent killer reveal.
This movie is a fucking masterpiece
i really like the movie theres just 1 tiny problem i have..............HOW. DID. BILLY. LOOMIS. HAD. A. KID.
I just finished part 3, and it's great to know that the film has even had a fifth part.🤩
This movie was TRASH
And Sam 's Dad is killer in Scream 1???
This is so good guys Umber Sus
The worst movie in the whole world i swear
Reading some reviews seems original fans do not like this new movie.. Where newer people do.. That right?
Yawn. Already trodden ground this is just the s#$t left in the tread.
Scream 1taps
Dumb movie. 😂. Someone wants me to suspend belief, next time make the killers believable.
Worst scream ever…..cheap acting horrible screenplay ……please no more….was Courtney cox that bad economically so she decided to be part of this crap?
they surely have to keep milking this shit.
If Neve dont come back, make Kirby the new Sidney!!! Plz Paramount!!! She could definately take that role as the new main survivor
Hello Cindy
Predictable snoozefest.  They took the well-known, original cast members, mashed them together with a bunch of boring nobodies, and set them in a recycled script with some ad nauseum exposition in hopes that they can make an extra buck off of the pre established Scream fan base.  Way to milk a franchise and dumb it waaaaay down for the idiot gen Z crowd, Paramount.
Same the movie is so good I watch it so much
Was Ghostface bigger than a costume? Were his deeds intended as mysterious celebrations of some sort?
This was a overly meta-fied movie that didn’t live up to what one would want for what was supposed to be a tribute to Wes Craven and maybe closure to the original movie. The young cast members were annoying to say it lightly. The same cliched horror tropes were still there. And maybe the original movie worked within the time and technology available but using those same tactics and dumbing down the characters (not even dumbing down but removing some semblance of reality) just didn’t work.
bolje bi ja napravila 🐐
Out of the horror movie sequels, this one is my favorite so far. Why? because Gale and Sidney didn't lose their intelligence, Dewey did tho so that's unfortunate. The new protagonists were not that stupid, which is something I appreciate. Halloween Kills and the new Texas Chainsaw can suck since both disappointed me big time. The pattern of these horror movies is killing the OG characters so the new ones can replace them. Thank god Courtney didn't die because I'm a huge FRIENDS fan.
It was absolute garbage.
All of scream movies are the best....
I loved this movie so much! I watched it on my flight, Thanks Emirates
The fact that the ending was kinda satysfing
did dewey just died wtf
ghostface iz back
I HAVENT SEEN THA MOVIE BT LOOKSGOOD
Sinister was bette
Not scary!
I always think of the scary movie scene 🤣
Am i the only one missing this kind of horror thriller film?
Neve is out of 6
TOO MANY "FUCK" WORD SPOKEN IN THIS MOVIE. HMMM I HATE IT
Let me guess, ya'll favorite killer is Amber
I jus hate it that at the hospital there was noone there like what hospital is empty with patients inside?  And like how the sheriff was killed infront of her house broad daylight in a nierbood with no cars no people around?
Scream 6 next year yes
Since I was 10 and I'm 30 now
Such a big fan of neve Campbell and all 5 scream movies
Rating: 0.2/100.😑 So Stop making sequel of it. Waste of money 💲 and time.  I felt pathetic while watching this.  Same mistakes.  Same old script. It seems that the same is written with the murderous children of novices.  ️Stupid characters like kids, police, aaah every one.  ️The police are seriously all pathetic that's all
This was beyond dumb af. How gale get shot in the spleen and is able to yet walk and sit comfortably afterwards 😑🙄
Courtney Cox?
😂😍

MY MOST FAV SCREAM INSTALLMENT AND ALSO MY MOST FAV HORROR MOVIE ALL TIME.  NO OPINIONS CAN CHANGE THAT :))
THIS MOVIE WILL ALWAYS HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART
I literary just watch it. It was confusing how the killer played the game didn't know it was the girl & the other girl bf was in on it. Just wow the ending shock me I felt bad for Dewey 😔 but the sisters came thru n pull it together n track them down at the very start in the house
It's an honor.
Me and some of my cousins went to watch no way how in theaters a few days after it’s release day and during the previews when I saw this I just closed my eyes and I never want to be alone now seeing that
Wait clay?
I watched this it was good

Some liked the grumpy (older) Riley. He thought he was done with the case. But he realized it was not just any case. And he was the expert: he had studied patterns. He had pondered impossible possibilities. Actor Arquette played Dewey. Or Dwight?
Can't believe you guys really killed Dewey...he was the most important character. You shouldn't seperate Sidney, Gale and him. I was crying at that scene he died. I read comments of explainations why he died, but movie would also be perfect without his dying. I wish he could be back in some 'Scream'...💔  I can't come to terms with the fact that he died. 🤷‍♀️
ரிங் பாத்தா சங்கு தான்
I also like the voice lines of Ghostface
The only reason I like Scream is because of Ghostface, he looks dope and I like to thank the people who made this movie, I'll watch it at the Cinemas or at home
waste of time.
I love how they bring  the original  actors to the new movie
I hate horror but I think I love this movie
the only reason imma watch this is because i play warzone 😭
Gail weathers cracking jokes 3 hours after doofus was stabbed to dead like nothing even happened lol 😂 hospital scene , nurses and doctors all on strike lol😂 oh and not one camera 😂I already know who the killers are .. il be backkkkkk !!! Ok I'm back , that sucked , I mean that really sucked , we all knew it was him and concerned friend , sqeeky fart twist , and horrible jokes and one liners , people dying left and right nobody bats an eye lol 😂 cash grab movie that didn't grab any cash

Writers ruined a horror movie because of political correctness
Was Dewey´s mistake not his attempt to figure things out, but in thinking that he could "wrestle" with destiny?
Samantha was a little eerie when she suggested a new rule.

This țara home doesnt have lights on your staying it off
I hated all the scream movies except the first one, every one after the first was nothing but copies and the last one better be and needs to be the very last one. Seen one number 2 through 5 are one in the same, boring ass old trash and honestly they should've stopped at the first one because even it was garbage. I mean come on people who the hell hasn't played out the slasher movie, it's all the same, same garbage motives same lines and routines. Horrible just plain horrible even Friday 13th was far better than this. Why did they even make 5 movies in the first place.
I just watched it & I gotta be honest I didn't really like it. I don't know what it is, maybe because we lost Dewey. I mean it was ok but highly doubt I'll watch again. I just can't put a finger on exactly why I didn't though. No disrespets to the acting everyone was great just didn't wow me.
فيلم رعب واثارة رائع وجميل   سلسلة رائعة وجميلة وسعيدة جداً  لكن لكانت أروع واجمل بكثير جداً لو كان القاتل مخفياً تحت قناعه ولا يعرفه أحد طوال هذه السلسلة من هذا الفيلم أو ما سوف يأتي بعدها . ورغم أنه سلسلة فيلم شبابي تدور نفس أحداثه عن نفس القصة الاولى - مما يجعلك تملّ منه - وكل من يشاركون فيه  ممثلين شباب ، وحتى ولو حاولوا ستر صاحب " القناع " في الأجزاء القادمة - إن كانت هناك - فقد إنتهى وقته وإنكشف صاحب " القناع " ، لكن صورة " القناع " تجذبك إلى متابعته . إلا إذا كان هناك فيلم ذو وجه " قناع " مخفي يشبهه في الرعب أو أكثر رعباً منه .
No one uses land lines anymore phoney ass movie
why so many female characters bro
Please,please...please. Don't make another one of these..... I'm begging....😞
Was Ghostface ever caught red-handed? If not, do the movies imply that it was part of a supernatural ritual or diversion with chosen folks allowed to play reaper?
this movie was hella mid
Feels like back in time when the first came out.nothing change just the actors (some) the way they play it’s just the same and love it🤪 But why in this movie everyone’s phone has the same ringtone?🤣🤣🤣
🥶🔥
i like how the trailer show the killer tho not directly
I watched this it was a disappointment. First of all it made no sense how Billy(the original killer since 1996) has a daughter(Sam) but he died a teenager and he wasn’t even married nor did he have a proper gf in 1996. Another thing is, her “father” looks nothing like her nor does he look like the “sister.” The whole thing is a mess in 2022 version. They should’ve kept it at 1996. The new actress Melissa(Sam)does not know how to act she’s bland and the only thing that made this better are the features of the original actors from 1996. Another terrible script was how the killers kept waking up after getting shot multiple times and getting burnt. They still got up and fought like nothing happened to them 😂 “Amber” and “Sam” were total jokes in this movie. The way they wrapped Courteney’s wounds on top of her shirt when she got stabbed is also a joke
God
Ooo 😱😱 so horror
absolutely frightened me at the start.....
I wish i didnt watch the trailer as I felt it gave away 70% of the movies best scenes and yes I'm going to say it quote Scream 4 "it gave away the element of surprise!" I will not be watching Scream 6's trailer at all and I can't wait to see it!! I give Scream 5 a solid 7/10 but if I didn't watch the trailer probably would have been a 8/10! Roll on Scream 6!!!!!!!!
Courtney Cox & Jenna Ortega!!!!!!! <3
They used more woman  protagonist since the movie is Scream
I watched this on paramount plus & amber became “fired” literally
OMG! Lets goo
Crazy how some people think this franchise is good. Sarcasm and irony aside( plot armor for retarded writing) all the decisions and how situations play out just tell that whoever produces this is mentally disabled. The idea was good, but god how it was delivered ripped my gut out like how Dewey was. Man just squeeze this last one and fuck off before you ruin it like the previous films
After watching scary movie its hard to take this seriously lol
Looks like a comedy
Is Ghostface intended as dark celebration regalia sent to intervene, to repeat a pattern, to keep a memory alive, to display power, to direct & to produce, to remind about the difference between mortal & deity in the movie?
I need part 6!!!! I love it
Some wonder if the phone calls were inspired by old-fashioned paper letters.
Boa tarde, um bom filme.Adorei o vídeo.
Tara: this isn't funny amber  GhostFace: would like to play game Tara
WOW, I can’t believe it, so many years we lived under one roof there were no problems, ghostface is now back, THE SCREAM FRANCHISE IS BACK AND THE MOVIE SCREAM IS BACK?! What a cool movie ever, I watch it everyday, my older cousin watched it in the cinemas and he said it was funny and not scary, what a hero my older cousin is! SCREAM MOVIE IS BACK AND GHOSTFACE IS BACK AFTER 25 YEARS! GHOSTFACE IS BACK
So Billy Loomis had a daughter called Samantha (played by actress MelissaBarrera)? Did Dewey Riley solve the case, write books about it & encounter weird psychics?
This movie sucked. 🤷‍♀️ It’s like the franchise just didn’t know what to do with the story line after the first movie…just gets worse and worse. 4 and this one are just terrible…even the acting in this last one was terrible…wish I never seen them.
They really spoiled everything with this trailer and the “hello Sidney it’s an honor” was a total misleading smh. Scream 3 is even better than this one, hell even Scream 4 lol. “Save the franchise” motive? Like really? I hope the next movie will be a lot better and more surrounds the original cast. No more stupid Stab movie motive or some shit. It’s getting boring already. Otherwise just quit the whole franchise because it’s getting nowhere.
I’m the guy everybody let’s live lol I’ll just play my guitar lol
congratulations!
Watch movie online here: http://usheethe.com/HisC  Hope you like it! =)
Me wearing  this at Halloween  13 what's your favorite scary movie  with a fake knife  to funny
I actually enjoyed this. The out of nowhere attacks made me jump and say, "Oh Shit" really loud!
scary movie 1 - comedy + horror = scream movie
So glad I waited until after seeing the movie to watch this spoileriffic trailer.
2/10
One of the stupidest films ever made.
This isn't amber
Ahhhhh I’m finally watching it
Omg crazy movie bruhh
Enjoy that torch.
Sus
Absoultly waste time of time
I understand this is enjoyable for people that have seen the previous movies but if you don't have a connection whith previous stuff this  simply will be your worst movie ever watch!! I MEAN for me was my worst movie ever
Well Gets What Scream 2022 Movie Cast Evanescence’s Track Haunted It Is Perfect For Any Horror Movies.
First of all this 2022 scream is not that great......And I thought Daylan will gonna be the killer??!!
2:02
Yo i need to see people beat the shit out of scream, like holy shit he is just a normal guy in a mask.
*Pro tip;* if ur scared but also wanna see the trailer turn off the sound completely and put on subtitles😎😎😎
Just viewed this on Paramount+ on their free 7-day trial. I'm glad I didn't pay. Especially a movie ticket price. I'm not saying this movie is bad. This is okay for a fanfiction story, actually semi-decent quality fanfiction, but my problem is and I knew it would be---it absolutely felt like fanfiction. Some fanfictions are so fantastic that they don't feel like they were written by a fan but that they could be a new creation by the original creator. Those are extremely rare and this is not one of those. But then, it seemed like it didn't want to be either. I guess this works and achieved very well for what it wanted to be. This movie had its moments, and I kinda see what Kevin Williamson meant when he said that the writers understood the heart of the Scream movies, but...That's not enough for me if it still feels like fanfiction. This may sound like I went in wanting to not like this, but that's not the case. Which is why I don't hate this and don't think this was waste of time. I'm simply glad I didn't pay to see this, am unlikely to watch this again, and this didn't exactly leave a lasting impression.  In my opinion the Scream movies deserved more than self-aware fanfiction. I don't know why Williamson didn't just write Scream 5 himself if a movie company was interested in funding another one. He has said 5 and 6 are all in his mind as in he has/had a vision for how his original story would have continued. That's what I'd want to see, that's what I'd support by paying to see. I tell you, one thing I'm glad about though, is that this movie made zero direct references to Scream 3. As in, I don't think everything Williamson has thought up is gold. Still it's his vision that started this and I feel it's his vision that should end it when it comes to Sidney's story.   I'm not saying fanfiction is inferior form of writing, no. I don't think that. Even less than great fanfiction can be enjoyable and is worthy of analysing, feedback and such and at best it can be a heart-felt love-letter and tribute to the original. Just...I don't think it shoudl be inserted into franchises on this high level. At least not as long as the original creator is still with us and able to continue the story themselves. Until the original creator is gone, fanfiction ought to stay in the internet and in self-published books. The torch should not be passed in this way too soon.
It would be more scarier, if Scary Movie wasnt exist, lol
As a big fan of the scream series. I'm really surprised with this one! Scream 1 is good but my absolute favorite was Scream 3! Imo Sydney's brother Roman was the best ghostface killer!!
Lame rehashing the same movie!
Watched it and it was amazing. AWESOME MOVIE
I love how they finally made a 5th instalment I'm downloading the movie right now
This movie was really good! I give it a 7.8/10 it was really good!
Movie was terrible. Sydney and Gale should have been dead from their wounds and yet they're fine and have blankets wrapped around them. What kind of hospital can just have all the lights shut off and there are no nurses or doctors. No effort or thought put into the writing. Scream was always meant for 13 year old girls who don't know any better. Awful. The first Scream sucked as a horror movie.
Well the same plot told all over again. Cha ching!
It's good. I liked it (anything beats Scream 3, however!)
Just watched this …. SUPER LATE … but I loved it!!!!! Thought the “Friend” characters were all Super annoying (specially the Meeks twins) but all in all I loved it!!! OF course I loved the Legacy Characters 🥰   R.I.P Dewey😭😇
It was so 1999 ..👎
It was a load of crap 💩
Saw the movie they should have put housewives of any kind theses people were old to be playing teens yuck
WTF has Courtney Cox done to her face :(
I don't think  I would rate this movie this is only about serial killer😐
This why I don’t live in America
Only white people die in the film. 3 different people of color are attacked but survive. Fuck woke hollywoid
this movie was dogshit
👻
❤
I know kirby wasn't in the movie or drew Barrymore
ชอบลูกฆาตกร มากที่สุด โรคจิต เจอ โรคตจิต ฆาตกร ปะทะ ลูกฆาตกร  ภาค 6 คงมันสุดๆ ถ้า มี 10 ภาค ก็จะดู เราเป็นแฟนตัวโยง ♥♥♥♥♥♥
No doubt one of the best from my childhood
There's one thing that I do know about these horror movies 🎬  Is that there is never a true ending🔪🩸 To  SCREAM 😱
I feel like I have deja vu cuz I feel like I already seen this before it even came out
It was good
suparb trailer
Its ridiculous that u cant kill sidney, just kill her that's what I want, btw movie was osm
The tagline should have been someone taking their love of requels one step to far instead we get the killer on the poster.Now on 4K UHD Blu-ray and DVD thank you Paramount and Miramax for bringing us this worthy Requel which is still Scream 5 lol.
SPOILER!!! Does anyone else feel they knew Dewey was going to die because of the small clip of Gale being held back. I wish they took that out of the trailer.
I love the catering to toxic gen Z feminism in this movie (the whole idea of women can do it just as good if not better than men) sorry but being a serial killer wielding a knife taking grown men out is not your role nor is it close to reality..what makes a scary movie is the idea of it being plausible.... the end of the movie when the killers identified themselves so anticlimactic... unscary.. and laughable as apparently the one doing the heavy lifting wielding the knife to be a 100 pound soaking wet sororiety looking girl with daddy issues and the other killer making the phone calls a goofy simp dude.. of course the male was to look weaker than the woman killer for equality sake... just some insights into the culture were living in now.. Anyway  I guess we need go an extra step in the fiction department once more to cater to supposed equality of the sexes... this was a sad and disappointing movie. Sorry for the spoilers
I'm not gonna lie scary movie ruined it for him 😂
Sidney now looks more like Gail Weathers than the original Gail Weathers.
He killed all persons
Why does this film have so much profanity in it? It takes away from the movie, but that is the world we live in.
Amazing
oh hey its that dude from dead by day light
Just got the 4k of this. Why is "doors unlocked" in a mans voice? The digital and this trailer had a women's voice which sounded better.
I've said this for years now: if you can access your locks (or any other appliance) remotely, then in theory it can be hacked. People seem so naive about this being a possibility

Scary
This movie is good !!! I don’t know why some people don’t like it
Movie looks Epic (Scream)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_g0BNOldeM4&list=OLAK5uy_nuJyxjqTosjpe-1eq-jOkmQc3OyMBCIXI&index=1
How this franchise has any following is beyond me, it was never even good.
This is was bad. I couldn't stand it. 1/5
Is this a joke movie?   Will anyone actually pay money to watch this crap?
Lol
Ngl never was a fan of the way they played the ghost face character cause he actually looks sick af but I hate their motive and the background of the character ghost face idk but I hope they make a new scream movie that is more about a killer who wears the ghost face outfit and kills kinda of like micheal myers but that’s my opinion either why I liked this movie and the way ghost face looked
All doors locked
Doors unlocked
Hello Cyndy lol
👍🏻😃👍🏻👍🏻
Y love this women
Are you fuckin serious?  Stop!!!  no really plz stop.
The "doors unlocked" voice was male in the movie. It suspiciously sounds like the ghostface voice actor.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 everything about this movie is amazing
Really good movie
Scream for liberal socialist millennials and zoomers from commiefornia that cant see and each other in real life.
I have not seen this yet but I honestly can't wait! I've always loved the Scream movies 😁
Sad moment when judy and dewey was die 😭
Batter then other movie of it
Finally some real action on this movie
Ghostface is a mutha!!  Paul Dale Roberts, HPI's Esoteric Detective Halo Paranormal Investigations www.cryptic916.com/
Is this a horror movie or crime movie🤔🤔
I hate that they killed Dylan Minette right away.
That masked person can still kill that policemen with having 3 bullet in his body wow what a scene 😂😂👌👌
I love this movie.                5 seconds.          Later.                                   Oh my God so scary.            When it comes to scream I'm scared oh my God.
A knife, a mask, a cape. That's all you need to mace a scary movie        Do you like scary movies?
Omg it's a house phone! Those still exist???
I saw the film it's scary
THEY ALWAYS COME BACK
why people like this film??
This movie SUCKED
there's two impostors amoung us ...
✨UNDERRATED✨
Screaming
It doesn't pull any punches. Check it out.
Just saw this film last night on theaters and it ROCKS!!
Scream 😱 Come 🤩 Movie with Scream 2🤣  Scream Com 4 😱😱😱😑
Strašidelnou městu výstava fotografií 😃🔓😭🔊🙂😪
Reboots or "requels" like this have the potential to be horrible. This one found the right balance, and made me invested in the new characters just as much as the old ones. Plus. it was the right amount of self-aware in what it was trying to do - as any Scream movie should be.
All the screams are the same just different year
this one is gayer than the 4th one
Just watched this spoiler the killer is sam’s best friend
Love this!!!! 💙 #Legend
Lol this movie is  the most Boring Movie I ever seen 🤦🏽‍♂️ Next
Great movie Only 1 issue .. HOW THE FUCK DID THE TEEN GIRL OVERPOWER DOUEY ... AND KILL HIM .. HOW THE FUCK
Very good movie Better than i expected
Not a good movie. Same as the others, nothing new
SPOILER ALERT BELOW:  I love that Sidney now has a family with Kincaid. Would love to see a Scream movie down the line where Neve Campbell and Patrick Dempsey are at the forefront protecting their girls from Ghostface; with Auntie Gale, of course. ❤️
How come skelator is in this movie? Isn't that a different film?
Awesome trailer bro 🥰😍😘❤️
I love how Sydney is presents in every parts coz she is the main cast of the scream franchise.
I’m literally watching this right now. 3/4 of the way through and yeah it’s cool and all but the OG’s are the best no doubt. 80’s & 90’s slasher horror is just where it’s at. Lol  Been patiently waiting for any worthy opponents 😂😂
i think canadian actress Marie Avgeropulos, could play Sidney Prescott's daugther, they just favor one another.
DOES ANYNODY KNOW THE SONG THAT COMES OUT WHEN SAM ANX TERA AND RICHI GET TO THE PARTY AKA THE MEMORIAL I NEED THAT SONG
Today isee it
This was way better than the last one.That last one embarrassingly sucked.
I hope they can bring back season 4 of scream with a new cast.
Knowing all the damn wokness that Hollywood jams down our throats, I'm predicting that the killer in this new Scream movie will end up being a female because why not? Might as well destroy another good franchise.
We all know we want them to make the short film "Jason vs Scream"
This Scream movie SUCKS because Wes Craven didn’t direct this one. They were missing a lot work Wes usually did before he passed. What they did wrong in this movie was predictable. Valar Morghulis is what happened as I expected. This fan fiction movie didn’t count at all
No thrilling chase scenes.... I didn't recognize a scream movie here. Stylistically they wanted to undo the clichés of the horror film so this Scream seems devoid of any personality. On the other hand at the level of the scenario there is no originality. The only thing I like is the opening scene with the excellent Jenna Ortega. Worst acting is Melissa barrera.
This was soo good. I mean once you get past the realization that Neve and Courteney are obviously men.. I still rooted for them  lmao
For me this was one of the worst movies ever, plot is bad, acting is bad and just cringy in every second of the movie
It cracks me up they still throw in landlines 😅😅
The WORST of them all.
I couldn’t even look at Gail seriously. That Botox was awful. Such an eye sore like I couldn’t even focus on the movie and I found her acting in this one was horrible as well. There was a few gnarly kill scenes w some good camera angles but overall that was probably one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen and an embarrassment to the franchise. Would not recommend.
I place this movie in the same category as that shitty robot chucky film that came out recently. This was the most disappointing scream movie.
Holly, I've just watched the worst horror movie in 2k22. Honestly I rly feel damn so sad for the 2 hours I've just have wasted in my life. I cannot believe how could exist kind of people projecting the things damn so wrong.  I would be really glad if there was not a scream 5 instead or at least they could have found another name for this failed movie. Compare to other series the only plus for this movie was the quality which tbh wasn't that high but yeah. Projecting The killers IQ level was even lower than the IQ level of Marth & Harry from home alone. Honestly Billy and Stu would watch and laugh with Richy and the other killer girl. The whole movie is based on the biggest copyright I have ever seen in my life with huge spaces and minuses for the young actors. Sadly, the pre policeman Mr D who survived that many stabbes was killed in such a disgusting way by his own mistake by the worst killer in all the franchise. Nothing else to say, I rate this movie 2/10 and not worth for watching if you're truly fan of the scream franchise you would be really dissapointed!
😂
Why was the females voice used in the trailer but males in the movie??
This movie was good  The killings were whew had to close my eyes  ! Lol  better than any horror films like in the past 6 years  but it was totally obvious who the killer was 🤭  The opening was good too
Trash movie for brainlets
Seems like slasher Movie...
Trash movie, thanks for wasting time
Way to easy to figure out who the killer was. Compared to originals of course. But this is what happens when you watch like a detective lol
They give away one of the killers in the trailer :D
Can't wait for parody
One of the shittiest movie i ever watched even Neve Campbell looks like she was annoyed replaying the role
Much better than Halloween Kills. I hope they keep this up in the sequel next year.
She literally shit herself in this scene
You can easily counter him just by staring at him guys.
혼내주세요 Axis of Evil Korea 🇰🇷
Just finished it,    Tbh there's prolly never gonna be a good scream movie
For this solely Russia should destroy the USA.
New characters aren’t too interesting
I thought Tara was gonna kill her sis until last minute of movie LOL
When Ghost face calls Samantha at the hospital how does she not hear him on the phone when he was literally a foot away behind a door 🤔👀
Loved every single second of this movie! Well thought out and the actors were good. The little throw backs were so awesome! And it just confirmed that Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox & David Arquette are fantastic no matter what. (sorry, not sorry, massive fan of this franchise)
This is a better trailer
This movie sucked. I’m supposed to believe that little girl was able to kill Dewey like that? Picking him up with two knives and spilling his guts lol unrealistic. She’s what 102 lbs? Dewey’s like 185-200 lol yea ok 👌🏻 and the other killer was that skinny nerdy pussy boy? Weak. It was disappointing. Huge slap in the face to scream fans.
Are bhench*d bawal trailer hai ba 😵😲😈👿👹👺😳😱😱😱😱😨😭
This was definitely one of the worst ones, utter rubbish🗑️
worst movie in 2022 hands down
Best scary movie ever😂😂
This scared me to shits
Brain 🧠 dead producers making garbage movies for a brain dead audience
I love from Indonesia🇮🇩
If only they had Stu involved. That would have made this movie hella better.
i dont get it u can always fight knife with something longer like a baseball bat or idk broomstick
I only watched it hoping and praying gale and sidney would get killed.... instead they kill off the best character of the original..... nothing new there then
I'm from Brasil and i love the Ghostface ♥️♥️♥️💀👻
well, this scary film may creep me out a little bit, especially the series, but i'm going to be brave.
Whazzaaaapppp😛
Its ridiculous how ppl get stabbed 80 times but still get up and go to restaurants with a bullet in the chest ,they even order KFC with bulletholes  in the head 🤣🤣That bit was a big lie,great movie though
Dewey died 😐
Looks more scary than the first that came out might be a good remake.waiting to see who is behind this mask of terror this time
This movie is garbage.  Stick to the others.
Neve Campbell keeps me watching every time. She is a sight to see and an awesome actress.
I watched this yesterday with my family and it’s very GOOD 1000000000/10.
Can´t wait!!!!!
Not so good. The other screams were way better.
By far the worst one
Like the Movie… BUT WHY DID DEWY DIE?? I wonted to TURN IT OFF AFTER THAT!!! I HOPE THERE A 6 and they BRING HIM BACK CAUSE I COULDVE MADE THIS A GOOD MOVIE
Scream but way worse and has black and brown ppl
The final chapter
such a good movie 10 out of 10
0:19
Boring imo; and apparently they want a Krueger story in scream Krueger is a demon who doesn’t team up with anyone so I hope they don’t do this
This movie really sucks.. man...  ...... Please if u need a professional director.. I will do the honour...
when i was 15 years old i used to go to video clubs and asked to see exorcist hehe..i will stay in wes craven
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Had 2 be there in 96
IconiC
Damn, I swear our girl Neve does not age rip Cassie
Scooby doo movies have better stoty line than this shit movies.wasted my 1GB data🤮
Sry it doesn't look scary at all, they should learn marking horror movie from korean and thailand people
3/10 rate. Very ordinary horror movie & overrated because of poor story making🥴.
I waited the whole movie for  “Hello Cindy, Its an HONOR” And jt wasn’t there 😔
"Im sydney prescott of course i have a gun" what a dumbass line
Isitisitisitisit good?
Terrible movie, the acting by the young cast was garbage. Campbell's character was underwhelming, I don't think Cox even knows what planet she's on anymore.
very very good ilove it
i watch the movie they are so many plot twists
This series ended at 3 for me. 4 wasn't horrible, but as far as "bringing the franchise back for newer fans", it should've ended with S4. Why they gotta drag it out like they did with Halloween and F13th etc is just so typical and lame. It ruins this series imo. Scream itself was original at it's time, and now they're turning the series into a money grabber. Now plus with a S6 on the way.  For me, Randy dying was huge loss, and ultimately..when S3 ended with that final shot of Sidney feeling slightly skeptic to see the front door to her safe house open, but then courageously walks away..believing that it's all over now for her...that was a perfect way to end the series. And again, I didn't hate S4 (I'm not a huge fan though), but after that 10 year reboot, it should've been over for good.  Scream is one of my favorite horror movies, pretty much the only heavy slasher one I like and will watch, but now it's (as Randy once said) "being destroyed by sequels." And if you think about it, again, pretty much every iconic horror film has multiple, dragged out sequels/reboots. It would've been nice to see Scream end after a trilogy. Or at the very least, after Wes Craven died.  Well, anyways, I will always be a big fan of the original trilogy, but the newer generations can have S4, 5, & the upcoming 6.
Just watched this today. Sorry to say, for the most part besides the last 20 minutes or so, this was garbage. I felt no attachment or even care towards any of the new characters, there were big plot holes that made no sense, the acting of the new cast was pretty mediocre except for a couple characters, and I knew the ending like 30 minutes into watching. Characters were overly dramatic and didn’t feel real at all, but rather like a product of a thrown-together, lazy script. The returning cast members did a good job reprising their characters, but the “diverse” casting made no sense, and the fact that they were all “related” to the original characters was just stupid. Randy had a half white niece and nephew? Billy had a daughter who was Hispanic from a girl that was literally never mentioned before this movie?   Disappointing cash grab at best. Poorly written PC garbage at worst. By the way, the libtards will be happy to know that no minorities are killed in this film. Just a bunch of white people, and literally that’s it.
Horrible movie
Movie was awesome, but the logic was not there. My main question was how did Tara survive all of that? And even if she did she would have been in the ICU possibly fighting for her life. But homegirl was doing GREAT the next day.
Happy to see Jack Quaid. Well right away I don’t care about Tara, Amber, the sister, her friends 🙄 Typical tv teen who’s “not into normal teen things because she’s so mature” 😆 Hereditary, the Witch, proves she’s an intellectual teen 😆 I’m hoping they improve on cliches. I also wish they’d stop casting 25 yr olds for high schoolers lol I’m sure they’ll all be so informative and piece together the mystery before the adults 🙄 The teen dialogue is another cliche. I’m watching for the OGs: Neve, Courtney, and David 😍   That hospital scene where Dewy dies was absurd.
Are all horror movies just going to have the main character come back to stop the killer? 😭 Halloween and leather face did this now… scream?
This movie was same predictable crap ....i deleted it from my downloads after half an hour🤦🤦
TRASH
This is the most ridiculous movie i've ever watche!!
1st of all Sydney Prescott finally has a gun surprising cause she said of course I'm should be pressed and of course I have a gun 1st time to graduation
If this movie have an "everything is wrong with" video, it will be 2 hours longe cause for real everything is wrong with the movie, waist of time.
Why has there not been a prequel Scream that goes into the Maureen Prescott murder
Halloween Ghostbusters Texas Chainsaw Massacre now Scream  All doing the same thing with bringing a new cast in the same universe as the old cast and trying to harp on nostalgia
He’s sneakie
I'm so glad I didn't watch these trailers before I saw the movie... I feel like they give so much away!
Evidemment, et c'est bien normal, il ne vaut pas le Scream de 97. ce film permet tout de même de retrouver une partie des personnages de l’époque. Il y a presque que dans ce genre de films que l'on peut voir un personnage recevoir un coup de revolver dans le ventre, 3 ou 4 coups de couteau, bruler sur une gazinière après avoir reçu un coup de flingue et se relever pour courir avec un couteau en criant vers d'autres personnages. MDR.
the scary thing is there are some people find it scary
Saw the movie and... I didn't think it was good.  It seems like most of the 2019-2022 movies are rushed.  I knew who the killers were from the very beginning.  That says a lot.  You know how the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s movies kept us guessing... well, we need those type of movies again.
scream 1 will always be the best
Dumbest line I ever heard.  I'm Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun.  She's not John Wick, what is this trash.
If you have Paramount you can watch it on there I just watched it and it was really good 🥰🥰
Its a super idiot movie..!
More copycat trash. Proof there is no more creativity in movies.
Another garbage movie sick and tires scream stop making them
💥💥💥💥..watched it on NETFLIX and it didn't disappoint...
One of the stupidest movies I've ever seen
It was so good
This is new scary movie! Wow!!
Really thought Amber was related to the original Ghostface killer Stu Macher which would've made sense instead of a fan of the franchise. Overall it was a good movie.
The killers are jack quaid and mikey madison. Deputy doofy gets killed finally.
WAAAAAAAAZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
Complete garbage
It was awesome.
The most unsuccessful movie I've ever seen  I think it is a comedy not horror movie😂😂😂
this movie is so fucking horrendous, please save yourself time and never watch this dogshit excuse of a movie. actual trash
Neve Campbell doesn't age at all.  Always a beautiful woman.
I wish I hadn't watched scary movie 2.....because now this trailer looks funny
The first 40 mins was horrible, acting and all!  The worst Scream of the franchise, but it improved considerably once the known actors arrived
Just finished it. Was like watching a 2h-car crash with a bunch of people standing on the sideline applauding the great driving skills. It is a mystery to me how one can love this mix of unbelievable bad editing, flat dialogue, bad new cast and a pseudo-intellectual approach. The use of the the word "meta" not because it describes something effectively, but because it sounds smart, is killing the last braincells in a group of so-called fans, which thrive on reference alone - and needs not a single peace of substance. These movies are no requels... they are just tictoc-instant noodles-entertainment-bits, that will be forgotten the moment a new thrill is popping up. I mean... holy s**t... I feared it will be bad... but THAT BAD?
This movie was so good
is this on netflix?
"Hellooooooooo" *What's your favorite Scary Movie?*
It is not a horror movie .. Isn't it
Glad i wasted my life watching this garbage.... Even more so what the hell has courtney cox done to herself ????  I know 70 year old people that look much better with having nothing done ....Cosmetic ruins you !! Grow old gracefully ... I know i will..
This movie was so fucking good and the ending was epic!
Best movie since the very first one by far
This movie was an absolute masterpiece……..can’t wait for the sequel! I think Wes Craven would be proud of it!
Waste of time I watched this movie last night and it was so stupid lmfao
Waste of time. Characters are so dumb
Good movie and great to see the old cast haha👍👍 stabbbbbbb the eyeball🤪
I just wish the didn't kill Allison Brie in #4. I would love to watch her again!
The BUCK knife is a staple of scream!
I really like all of the Scream movies The latest one, the hospital scenes…empty hospital floors, no staff walking around, sitting at the nurses station, not another patient in sight  Anyway, loved the movie
I knew she was the killer first of
bro I came here from "the healing".. why is Julius still in the group chat when everyone was removed kinda sus if u ask me
This move has some essences of Hush film
horror movies ain’t even scary no more shit is pure comedy
im watching it rn.......the acting is dogwater
This was just dog shit and I love ghostface, but the acting was unbearable and the killers were just a mistake. I think it's safe to say the franchise has finally made too many of these movies to come up with an original idea.
After having seen the movie, I can't get enough of how much the franchise has taken to ridiculing overzealous fans..the "Stab 8" thing was hysterical.
What a pile of shit this is!! I’m half way through it and what a waste of time! The acting is atrocious, the monologue is pathetic. The only interesting part is trying to find Courtney cox real face in that mess of surgery!!
I'm back man.. this we all win 🏆
I have watched the movie. Even i watched all the scream franchise, the killer reveal is always unexpected. This story never gets old. For wes ❤️
Love this movie definitely going to my top 10 horror movies
The movie sucked big time lol
This movie was really bad too much drama and zero focus on what scream was , it seemed they tried to do a remake,, I did not like it.
Couldn’t wait for it to end
Shit terrible making all the white decisions
sy suka scream
penonton kecewa
teriak teriak doang
LOL This movie was garbage.
This one was a SUCKFEST!!!! 🤮
This was ight..
Where is Billy Loomis and Stu Macher? Can’t beat that duo. Wish Skeet Ulrich starred in that one . Anyways the best movies came out in the 1990s. Can’t beat that era 🎥 🍿
I finally watched the movie this month (March) & must say it's an excellently well-made suspense thriller.  It indeed lived up to the reputation of the Scream history.
*POOSAY UNLOCKED* *poosay locked*
Finally got my hands on this movie and wow what a movie. A little too on the nose for my taste but regardless a blast and honestly quite saddening too.
is it horror comedy or what i cant tell tbh.
I love scream
I couldn't make it thru the first 20 mins, hard pass.
OHHHH SHIT ITS NOT SCREAM UNLESS THERES A PHONE FROM LIKE THE YEAR 1991 GO  NOKIA OR W.E THAT SHIT BRAND WAS... THIS ONES GONNA BE A SCREAMER BABY...! SO YOU LIKE SCARY MOVIES? HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE GIRL THAT GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN AND THEN UP FOR LIKE 16 MINS STRAIGHT ITS A REAL CROWD PLEASER..!
as someone who hasn’t seen all the other screams yet… were some of the lines supposed to be as corny as they were? ☠️
Laik
ohhhhhhhhh this movie looks good, i can't wait to watch it !!!
Yet another one... I will pass, cuz when I watch this kind of movies; I spend more time screaming and giving suggestions to dumb ladies so they can escape smartly... but no, they have to run in high heels, hide behind net curtain, or run with a banana in the hand instead of a weapon. 🙄🙄
Going to watch it right now! I’m so happy they made another one!
This world is so sick 🤢 Why do Majority of ppl hate murder In Real life, but Love to watch it in a movie or tv series?? This world very twisted. Just down right demonic. It’s not too late to turn to Jesus because He is waiting for you all to seek and find Him. God loves you all too much to see you all lost today. Repent for your sins and Confess that Jesus is Lord and Accept him as your savior and your sins will be washed away. Believe that God rose Him up on the 3rd day from the dead and you WILL be SAVED. And no I’m not being a hypocrite because I used to be the same way and I understand what it feels like to seem like someone who’s a Christian is talking nonsense but now I truly see that it was I who was blinded. I’m not judging, just calling out evil when I see it. Love y’all man, really. But most importantly God says He loves you all so much, and nothing and I MEAN NOTHING can separate you from God’s love for you.
I want to watch at least one movie, which doesn't contain lespians!
Nah ain't nothing scary like Texas Chainsaw Massacre Leatherface
All movies gained self awareness this year ,first the matrix ,now scream ,who’s next
i liked this movie, would recommend it
I say in season 6 billys daughter wants to take revenge from Sydney for him and her grandma
Sydney and the other original cast members STILL look the same after all these years.
Should say it. Worst movie of the franchise, should have stopped by scream 4...😭
This movie was absolute shit. Terrible acting...terrible writing.. I plot full of holes ... and absolutely disrespects all previous films and characters
DO NOT WATCH THIS, its shit !
1:27 doesn't actually appear in the film🤔
The best scream movie since the original!!!! Can actually continue you the franchise with these plotline characters!
اجمالي كافيه هو الأربع الي باق. على قيد الحيات
i dont know what it is but this freaking movie/series gives me hope. hope of entertainment, talent, joy and good movie making despite all the crap that’s happening in the world. sorry to sound cheesy. but yeah. that’s it.
waza la pelicula es muy buena wazaaaaaaaa
I’m 51 minutes in this movie.  This one was kinda lame tbh. No element of surprise, most scenes were predictable. I give this a solid 4/10
how did scream get request location
This movie is so fucking stupid 😅😅
I watched it and it wasn't that good. Sorry guys, I had to say it
Ilove franquicia  Scream   : Scream 6 Main Cast Neve Campbell Sidney Prescott Corney Cox Gale Whethers,Heather   Matarazzo : Martha Meeks ,  and the Carpenter Sisters AND the Serial Killer Ghostface ; voice of Ghostface Roger L. Jackson Voice actor
Sending love from Iran to all Americans 🇮🇷❤️🇺🇲
I watched this movie today, this movie doesn't seem like horror but definitely one of the best suspense thriller I've watched
Just finished watching this... They should have never made it.
Not Dewey..
I don't care what anyone says.  This movie is fucking trash. There are so damn many loop holes. So many dumb mistakes. I can't even finish watching this. The original was okay, but this one is, fuking crap 😒  this is a blast from the past corny young teenager movie.
The lead actress looks like lisa of blackpink, i can't unsee.
Yo pick up the phone!!
This is why you don't get "smart" locks for your home!
The movie is silly.  the police are like a bunch of clowns
Terrible movie lmao
The Bullshit movie I’ve ever seen
The stupidest fuckin movie ever
Who is Wes? did he die in RL? (Showed his name in end of the movie)
when they introudced eachother like they dont know eachother xd
lol when the burnt one tried to get them
what if she chose to kill her bf whos also the killer
I thought shes protecting her from sister how in beigining-
I dont think mindy mickey died
bro why didnt we see killer say hello Sidney
This was one of the worst movies ive seen in a while. Cant believe rating are so high, clearly they were high. Ive watched the old Scream movies but basing a movie on nostalgia is nonsense. We blame Hollywood for unoriginal movies but them praised them when they give us 💩
bet on girl with pink hair as killer giving me season 4 vibe or taras sis but wes with blond hair has killer voice
Requel for sure was good kill scenes were more gore some of the acting by new cast could have been better
It's even worse than the last one it's just bad maybe start making original movies again instead of rebooting over and over again
This version is the worst
For boys and girl:  when you fight the culprit and somehow knock them down.  Learn how to do Eye-gouging technic. Best with both thumbs. Or bite a skin from their next with you teeth.  So even though they come back, they will use a glasses and cane.
No screaming with the covid mask on ?
Dewey was suppose to be stronger than amber but dewey lost the fight it doesn't make any sense.. but i still love sream franchise
Just finished watching it today and I wasn't disappointed.  Brutality: 10/10.
bagaimana bisa...billy loomis punya anak padahal dia mati diusia muda dibunuhsydney presscott  saat msh kuliah...aku bingung tolong ada yg bs menjelaskan
Spoiler alert: The killers did it.
I love movie so much
Even the trailer gives me chills lol when I first watched it made me jump lol
And Sam is a horrible actress
Tara is played by a Latina? 🤔
This is the worst movie I had ever seen!!! Please don't waste your time... The acting and story is mediocre. Wow...
where is the funny

I watched it and its so good
I’m new to watching horror movies because.. well I’m a wimp and get scared easily 😂but I wanna watch this, does anyone know if I should watch the older ones first?? Or is it okay to just watch this one. Because if stuff is related to the older movies then I won’t really understand
I almost thought it was a comedy.

The killings in this movie are more brutal than any other Scream so far
I just thought about this and had to share it with yall. I bet the directors regret having Billy killed in the first Scream, think about it, what if he got away at the end and would appear as killer in the 2nd and 3rd scream. Maybe with another accomplice or solo. Then it would be much more about Billy and Sidney.
Actually good
This movie is so shit
That was the worst parody movie ever made, its surreal people actually like watching this. World is doomed
Let’s not forget that’s Danny Rolling being that mask
Let’s not forget that’s Danny Rolling being that mask

5/10
when he asked to play a game i was expecting jig saw
It's a fucking killer. Let's go
Who is Billy and where was he located?
Can anyone why the fucking hospital is empty and what happened to cc cameras .....
Asshole movies talk ro much
I liked the Scream. What's your favorite horror movie?
i didnt even realize that jenna ortega was in the first scene
This was the dumbest shit I have ever seen 😂😂😂
I was born in 1996, the year the original Scream came out and to this day it’s still so good and a classic. I love all the Scream movies so I don’t got a least favourite. And in my opinion this new one was still good. All awesome movies
I watched this movie a second time today and it’s so good. I think it’s even better the second time because I watched the first 4 again before watching this one for the second time. And I understood more watching it a second time as well. I recommend for anyone that hasn’t seen this to watch the first 4 first or if you haven’t seen the others in a while, watch them again, and then watch this one. It’s a great experience watching all of them first and then this new one right after. All incredible movies
no spoilers: i have never 'heard' of american sheriff who ran into her house with a killer completely unarmed especially when she has information that there is a killer inside her house!
This youtube comments will make the next serial killer.
What's Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup!! I can't, since the parodies. LOL.
Waza película
The beginning scene is a great example of why you don’t let technology run your life… Just get manual door locks 😂
A large bucket of trash. Boring and NOT scary. So predictable. A very very weak script filled with expletives due to a lazy writer that reflects little ability.  A big Hollywood bomb.
Das Schlechteste was ich seit langem gesehen habe. Ich habe die alten Scream Teile gefeiert, bin mit Ihnen aufgewachsen. Wieso kann man alte Filme und Ideen nicht einfach in Ruhe lassen? Man wird im Film mit irgendwelchen Drehbuchideen vollgelabert, was ist das für eine Grütze? Ich will einen guten Film mit originellen Ideen sehen und nicht Argumente an den Kopf geworfen bekommen wieso jetzt doch genau dieser Scream Teil die absolute Sensation sei. Hollywood hat absolut keine Ideen mehr, es kommen nur noch Remakes am laufenden Band es ist zum kotzen ! Einfach nur dumme Geldmache mehr sind diese Zeitverschwendung von Filmen nicht. Jeder der hier 5 Sterne gibt ist hoffnungslos verloren ganz ehrlich, die Scream Atmosphäre wird hier mit diesen beschissenen "Film im Film" Dialogen komplett ins lächerliche gezogen. Schauspielerisch waren die "neuen" Charaktere in Ordnung, das wars dann auch. Der Rest kann absolut in den Müll.
So…I wanna watch this but haven’t seen any of the others…do I have to watch them all to understand this or just the original or what’s the situation here?😂
നെവ് കാംബെൽ ❤
Here we go again with every dumb choice a person could make, after being attacked, being made.  In the front yard of a massive house party, and got stabbed in the leg, and then hitting the baddy with a large metal lamp post? Easy. Run the OPPOSITE direction of the house party, to a small shed in the dark surrounded by bushes and trees. This is only one example of what makes this movie absolute shit.
Cant wait for scream 6 its confirmed😍
WAZAAAAAAAAAP
*WARNING*  THEY MIGHT BE SPOILERS...   Just watched it. I'd give it 5/10. Figured who one of the killers was half way through. It's nothing special lol. They could have done it way better imo. No jump scares...I couldn't get interested in any of the characters. It's idk...meh.  The whole "we do it for the fans and the love of horror movies" is old. I wished it was a different reason. You could basically pop in any of the Scream movies and change out the characters and it's pretty much the the same.  Just my  opinion though.😜
I wish Sidney was in Dead By Daylight
Courteney Cox's botoxed face was the scariest to watch in the whole movie.
I liked the new movie - requel, reboot, whatever you want to call it - and even though it should just be called Scream 5, I liked that they called that out in the movie when they said that the new "Stab" film should just be called Stab 8. Smart move.
It's actually good! 👍👍👍
I didn't like it
Worst mockery of the original
The original was way better.
0:16 SPOILER ALERT                 It was Amber 😐🦹🏻‍♀️
Waste of time
Great casting, again I was rooting for the killers.
Fucking excellent movie. Big nostalgia to 1996 Scream
I just wondered these days, why is that dislike button isn't functioning. LOL..
Worst movie i have ever seen 💯💩 😒 Unlogical shitmovie...
Just finished so good
The Ending Scene is Satisfying
Dumb as heck and using the oldest, most soap opera-ey trick in the book: the family card.
Nice trailer
serial killer is knows about technology?! count me in!
sidney be like: "Aw shjt, here we go again"
Ghost face doesn't say it's an honor when he she meets Sydney. He she says it when he she kills fjaisncosn. Misleading trailer.
You kinda have to be a fan to.  enjoy this movie. All.these critics are little turds that aren't 90s kids and they never saw the originals on vhs
i watched this with my bf it was really goodddddd
Too bad Gale wasn't able to swallow Dewey back too life, or at least try a vacuum cleaner on him.😂
Watch this and again watch scary movie 3 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
In loving memory of Wes Craven, the man who brought us horror movies. 😇💙
why do they have to kill dewey ? gale and him deserve happy ending
This movie sucked
meh...
Filme péssimo, muito ruim!
My God what have they done?.. And not in a good way.
I was really looking forward to this movie as i heard people talking good about it and critics praising it. But is was extremly repetitive as all the other sequels. This had the same plot and premiss as the 4th. This was like watching the fourth one. It was not shot in many places. No character building. It had potential to be more serious more scary this time but they went the same path as other sequels. Not much to the storie. And heavy on the feminists side.
"Scary Movie"
i think this killer its a hacker how he can open the unlock door 0:36   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I don't like the ending part...the killers started talking instead of killings!!! ...the time he was using talking, I wish he use it, he will have ended them ...Nice movie doh
I was so happy the Dooey finally got killed
i am very happy that i guess both the killer when i start watching this movie😍
I enjoyed this one like all the rest 💜💜💜
Movie was trash just like Halloween
whats MONICA GELLER doing here.......lol
Scary movie ruined his mask for me.... wazzzzaaaaa
Some characters are always not realistic
i watched this, extremely predictable, not scary turning into a comedy.
Nope, dumb shit was what this movie was filled with
This mf dosent die like Jason and Freddy I just want to unload full mag in him 😂
this Movie is just stupid and cheesy.
This is the only installment that the first victim is alive in a opening scene lol.
SPOILER . . .   The film's only pluses are the classic trio of previous films (for a very short time), the appearance of Billy Loomis.. The story is weak, and the film's placing of a lesbian character (as usual) as Randy's niece, expert, but an awful version of him.. Worse, they tried to recreate scenes from the first movie (with different characters, of course) such as the murder of Casey Becker, the drunken Randy watching Halloween with the killer behind him and Randy repeating: Look behind you, and the death scene of Billy Loomis (in a bloodier and overly bloody way that would appeal to teenagers), and the result is 👎in my opinion.
Wish there's a new decent scary movie too
The scene where sidney slapped the killer with a glass of gasoline (not sure it was) is still satisfying 😆
Ah yes a daughter of a serial killer is getting hunted by 2 other serial killers...
Great movie
Officer Doofy reporting for duty
Shitty movie....................................🤢🤮
Dumbest movie ever
Πραγματικά απογοητεύτηκα ήμουνα φαν των Scream!!!
The real life murder that this movie is based on is NOTHING WHATSOEVER like what the movies ended up being.
............... what makes a person think you autolock the doors and all is ok..... if me... i'd run up to the bedroom, dial 999. Also if its america..... like hey 99% of the time they reach for a gun? Hahahaha. God that opening is classic and what make this movie a success..... cheesysyyyy hehehhee.
i love how the basically spoil one of the killers in this trailer  LOL no fucks given by the editor
Plot twist : they don’t call the killer ghost face in the 2022 film, they call him black face.
This series is trash now if they make another Sydney needs to die.. you can’t just kill my man Dewey like that, Sydney Prescott needs to die I’m tired of seeing her survive these unrealistic scenarios lmao
Saw the movie . Totally sucked 😑😔
Despite all the negative reviews I read and all the bad feedback I saw on this. I still gave it a chance.  Well here I am..  Finding my self rolling my eyes every minute .. This movie, is not the worst.. but damn it's so predictable and such a repeat 🔁
It was most shittiest movie of 2022..worst, total wastage of time
This killers wont shut the hell up when they are about to hit the final blow.
I hope there is another Nightmare on Elm St with Heather langenkamp & Robert Englund again…….where Heather is a grandma now,protecting her grandchildren from Freddy(even creepier,wiser,sinister Freddy).(2010 version not included)…
I was so bored out of my mind. I regret seeing this non-scary film.
IM SO EXCITED
منو اجة من تيك توك
Amber was too obvious to be one of tthe killers reason why I didn’t think it would be her
Stupid....The whole plot, everything is just so dumb.
Love this series
I just came here to say..                       WAZZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?
Warning spoilers I just came out of the movie theaters, finished seeing the movie and I thought it was good!    It's sad what happened to Dewey, though. He made a rookie mistake by getting so close to a "passed out" ghostface killer instead of trying to shoot her from a distance, the smart way, and unfortunately he paid the ultimate price for it. He must have been in retirement for a long time to get that rusty and do something like that. Smh
This movie is shitt😭
It belongs to garbage
Buck Knife!
Dalton  mud trucks are the only ones to take a and roll in the
Really dumb, the killer(s) make the movie make no sense.
I finally downloaded it I am waiting to see it in an hour with some friends hell yeah!!!
I LOVED this movie! The good thing about scream is that it’s true to its story, it’s always a “whodunnit” and not some unkillable being. And we get to see some of our faves from the original. I’m pretty sure “Sydney Prescott” hasn’t aged at all! She’s 48 and I can’t believe it! She’s still a beast ad always a fan favorite
Someone gets stabbed seven times and lives. One character gets shot in the stomach and lives, two characters get knifed in the stomach and live. Not only that, they fight like they were fit as a fiddle and beat the two villains. Why didn't the vilains finish them off instead of having a good chinwag with them? What a load of tosh, and an insult to Wes Craven.
This movie is a pussy..
Ghostface is the main character’s boyfriend!  !!! TRELA RELIOPS
Why are the characters of the movies always stupid. And why is the hospital always abandoned with no people. Too much fiction.
So the killers r amanda and Richie bt when sam kills Richie at the end when she wipes the knife i think she also involved
It's same in HALLOWEEN KILLS 🙄
OMG I literally screamed throughout the entire movie.
Very very very bad....so many ugly faces(except Sidney)...bad words...why girls kisses each other...plastic faces..weird world....so bad...
The scariest part was Courtney Cox’ face
I was expecting it to be someone from their past coming back one last time to get them all... Big plot twist but still a good movie
theyre all good. but scream 4 was iconic with emma roberts as the killer because she really give scary pscycho killer vibes and the new scream was also good it was serious but also funny and that makes it a good movie . i hope to see more soon
Fake
Ummmm so they’re making it NOT funny this time, great😒
10/10🤗
Terrible waste of time movie. I guess it could be ok if never seen other scream movies but for me it was boring movie
Vindicator to moja wersja :P nowy Horror... .
After watching scary movie, I don't know whether I should be scared or WHATSSAPPPP
nothing interesting on the characters and plot story.
Do i need to watch any movies before watching this movie? I have no idea about this franchise yet
Absolutely well done! Enjoyed it thoroughly!
boooooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeedddddddddd
rikrok
idiot movie
Just finished watching!!! Did not disappoint! Loved seeing the OG's! I pretty much predicted the killers right away! I love how they honored Wes Craven at the end!!! Mastermind of Horror!!!! & When I was a teen that's when "Nightmare on Elm Street" came out -- I was a Junior in HS! "Nostalgia" for me! TERRIFIED ME!! ALL OF THEM!! He played FREDDY SO DAMN WELL! but Halloween will always be my FAVORITE! Even though it came out when I was 11 years old * again nostalgia *
Eee Eee Eee
Another movie ruined by girl power and Woke equality.
Let's be honest, this movie is shit! The whole story line don't make sense. A guy or girl in ghost mask killing people including the sheriff and yet, the local community acted like it's all right to shoot and kill at will.
"I have a question for you, Which Door Am I At!?"
Scary movie is the best lol
Don't bring a gun to a knife fight. Was hoping to see Chucky in the end...
Was never a fanatic about the scream franchise. As with most, they are riddled with bad acting, and predictable things happen, all have really cheesy scripts and this one was more of the same. Still watchable though, but kind of more of the same thing this whole franchise has been doing.
The opening scene was the only good scene in the whole movie!
as a big fan of scream movies, i have to say, that scream 5 was ok for me... only i have to complain about (spoiler - dont read) Deweys reaction when he died... he had to finish the killer in hospital..but that is cliche which oft we see in movies as these...  For a people who complain, scream is slasher movie with humor and satire... you have to know that, and you cant expect masterpiece... that is cleary...  7.5/10
stupid cops like other horror , slasher movie
This was a masterpiece, tied up there with the first Scream. I loved this movie ♥️
Save your time!!! This is literally the worst movie i have ever seen.  It was painful to get through. Poor writing,poor cast, made zero sense and just an absolute pile of rubbish.
The way they swist it one way or the other
4 best scream movie
7 / 10
Boring, dull and just plain bad.
My advice to everyone who's about to watch this: don't watch it and don't read what the other comments says they're all part of the acting team with their families trying to make a living out of this garbage.. just do not watch it, one of the worst "horror" movies you could ever see.. is this what you call horror nowadays? I'm truly disappointed after watching 30 minutes of this garbage, how is it supposed to scare when you bring an old stupid movie up again into the theater!  To the producers: please don't make a clickbait movies like that again or you can just quit this job so we never fall into this trap!
I've watched this it is asewome
l enjoy watch this movie
l enjoy watch this movie
الفيلم ده  قصته واخراجه في قمة العبط 🤦‍♂️
I like how the first scream is a parody of horror movies and now it’s a horror franchise
Meta verse
"you wanna play a game".... did they just steal that from SAW !  cummon find something NEW !
I used to love watching these types of movies when i was younger. Now it just cringes me knowing how dumb and illogical the scenes are. It is just wildly unrealistic, like how come someone get away with murder dressing up like grim reaper especially at a hospital where a stab victim was admitted and security measures are expected to be high? And how come the stab victim survived in the first place after getting stabbed that many times? Its just crazy. One last thing is how the fff did the other killer who is a woman got away after being shot a couple of times at the hospital and have managed to throw a party a few days later? She hasn't even thown any sign that he is injured especially when she attacked that dude at the party. She also appeared to be taller! Man, what a really dumb movie. I don't blame the actors and actresses on this because they are just doing their job which is to act and not have an authorship on how the movie will come together in the end.
So unrealistic , how come a dude with a knife can kill a person with a gun , this movie is ILLOGICAL ! not recommended at all
Not a bad movie, just felt the original cast were not given good enough scenes, and were just afterthoughts with little to no comedy between them unlike every other film in the franchise.
Kekekle
just saw the trailer and the rest is history 🤦
Lesson: don't use electronic door
Disapointed...Who gave this movie 7/10 ?????   What a bad movie, bad acting and scenes. It not horror  and not comedy.  its a poor poor Joke people.
It's not Amber, it's Joe!!! hahaha
it's so sad dewey , who were stabbed 9 times and returned from the valley of death like a phoenix really died it was so hollow and empty ending for franchise's best hero
SCREAM! SLASH!! SCREAM, SLASH..SLASHH SLASH SLASH SCREAM.
This is by FAR the worst one yet!! Omg there are so many things wrong with the setup.  The first one was the best and they fell off from there. This was like Fast 9 just a joke!
THIS IS VERY DUMB MOVIE LMAO
♥️ 🇮🇶 ♥️
so not real
Halloween is better...
dont get why peoples gotta trashtalk about anything.
Lol what a complete waste of time! It's like one of those low-budget TV movies with no storyline and hideous acting. Annoying fucking teens tried super hard but failed. Don't bother watching.
Good move very interesting
Was expecting something new, but NO.  Same crap, same cliché, same stupid teens.  Just stop it.
The perfect slashed flick!  Add this one to the list: Star Wars, Batman/Woman, Terminator, Captain Marvel, they murdered another franchise with this SJW crap!  Well done politically correct, uninspired, boring, Hollyweird!!  Yawn…
The last time I looked at the movie was in 2011 and when I saw the Scream 2022 Movie, I got so excited 🖤?  why 😂💔
i'm glad for David and the other actors that were in the original but *_NOPE!_*
More woke agendas. Not as bad as the new Matrix movie but still. The original Scream never added any garbage like they did in this one. Shame what movies have become.
Released in telegram ❤
Me personally I'm only 1:04hour in this movie and the time end @1:50 dis movie really dumb asf all the originals waaaaaay better.
saw this in the theater with my bf the other day and holy shit it’s good
At last, loved the scream movies..Perfect👍
How much money were you people paid to comment on this American Shit. And when did you Yanks stop using the word radical and Dude. C'mon.... the words suit you.
“Watch your tone new girl”😂😂
I can't believe how GOOD this movie was!!!!!!!!!! Well Done!!! Gives me hope for future horror movies.
I thought it's scary movie part 5
dont tell me this was the last part ?? 🤔😮🙏 poor Dewey 😡
man i cant take this movie seriously anymore, all i hear when i see scream is WAZZZUUUUUUUUARP!!!!
Wazzuuuppp!!
I don't like this franchise... Most of the movies in it are too self aware and too 'look how clever we are', but I have to admit.... I really liked this one. It was brutal to the extreme and took a justified stab at obsessive fandoms. I had a good time watching this :D
Acting is so soooo bad , kinda making it a comedy movie .
Stab!
Trash and pointless. Poor dewy didn't need to die for this .
Crap crap crap when will we see a decent original horror ?
This could’ve of all been avoided if they all just invested in a knife proof vest :/
Seriously?! People started vomiting after the third one of the original series! Now this?  Just because it was once a franchise many years ago doesn't mean a remaster or remake or whatever they call it is gonna blow off the roof!  Find new good plots for god's sake.  All of Hollywood is living on the glories of the past rightnow, or that Marvel shit with fancy CGI and horrible plot-stories!  Just find a good writer...  And by the way, and before the haters start, I am a scream-fan.  However, some nostalgic dramatic attention still won't make this a good movie!  Sorry...
I've been a scream fan and anybody saying that this movie is dumb blah blah blah etc,i thought it was awesome I don't want to say it's better than the first but it close so scream fan's watch it you won't be disappointed.
its fucking sad that people of a new generation have seen this, its ridiculous of a movie..... lets try to make more money off a old serial murder trope... i mean after 34 minutes i wanted to walk out of this bullshit... but you pay the ticket you take the ride... wish i just illegally downloaded this garbage... don't bother. hey young ins go watch the original 2 movies skip the 3rd and forget about the 4th. cheers to neve Campbell ... Father Craven wouldn't be happy about this 5th edition`. call it spleen rather than scream
Ohh no someone's coming to kill me, lemme just open the door for a sec.
they shold have left this franchise at 4, this should not have been made sorry but this must be the worst one . no offence to the new chick but noone can be badass like Sydney and then heartbreak omg like really? GenerationZ  REALLY NEEDS TO GET THEIR OWN MATERIAL AND LEAVE THE 90'S CLASSICS ALONE. Just like in this movie where they make fun of us 90's fans well if you knew you were gonna get backlash maybe you should have thought of your own movie plot and not massacre this classic slasher movie with such stupid storylines. Please let this be the last one no more sceam just wont be the same without a Sydney , Gayle and especially not a DUEY
Can't take someone seriously with a mask like that.
This movie was everything I wanted and more. I left the theatre happy but wanted more Scream. Thank you for resurrecting my favourite slasher film franchise!!!
No spoilers but this one is BRUTAL!!!!!
I rather watch another Scary Movie. 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
How does this even have 7.0 on IMDB? This has to be the worst horror movie i've ever watched. Almost felt like a parody.
My ranking for the Scream films: 1, 4, 2, 3. Where does 2022 fit in?!
I can't wait for this. One of those horror franchises that has stood the test of time. I think much of that has to do with the original cast. Wouldn't be Scream otherwise.
bro how does that knife penetrate her clothers then cut deep in her skin with such simple slice
Jenna Ortega and Nev look tasty as F !! ♥♥♥
i knew that i would have been dissapointed from the first minute i saw the movie.
its so fucking bad just as bad as the originals
My Favorite Horror Franchise  Wrong Turn The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Scream Chucky Friday the 13th Halloween The Hills Have Eyes
das ist nur möglich für hacker und mal sehen ob das ein film für naive deppen ist
Waiting for the Scary movie version of Scream
LMAO I cannot remember scary movie, i expected the chick to fart while answering the phone, it is so rodiculous
Seriously I've watched every single one of them from the original to this one and these last two are the only films out of the entire franchise I find to be a complete joke and disgrace sorry if you can't stick to the original storyline of scream just f*** off there is no passing the torch from Sidney Prescott and Dewey and Billy Loomis Gail Weathers or any of them you cannot pass on the torch from the original scream actors it just is impossible this movie and the last one or a complete disgrace to the entire franchise and both these movies should be burned
Seriously this new scream is a disgrace and a joke to the franchise same with the last one that came out before this they literally destroyed the scream franchise with two movies didn't think it was actually possible to ruin scream this is a disgrace they literally requel the s*** out of it seriously the last two screams have pissed me off so much that I feel like making the directors into the next screen film little bastards literally ruined scream with their sjw b*******
Straight to trash movie. Stay classy Hollywood. Love the fake scores you're giving your own movies.
booring
whatssssssuuuupppppp .......
Me and my bestie watched this in the cinema its great such a nice and satisfying ending 😂😂😂
Worst movie ever... finish this in 10 minutes
Remake of scary movie 1
You are doing a bad job for this
Why the fuck are you casting 25 year olds as high schoolers, so fucking weird watching someone who obviously is way too old to be in high school.
After watching the movie, no comment absolute shit**.....you are telling me that little girl threw Dewey across the floor and survived 2 or 3 bullet shots? What bunch of bullshit
Courtney Cox looks like tens of bees have stung her in her cheeks and lips.  She was such a beauty before. The botox didn't really do well for her, did it?   (Honestly: why do people even go for botox? Why do they not see the disastrous consequences faced by other actresses?)
Are they all dumb ?!! I mean his the only one and they can’t even defeat them ?!! Wtf ahahahahahahha and in the hospital scene really ??? There’s no one ?!!! NO ONE so are they the only patient there ? whaaaat the hell! 😂😂😂😂😂
Fucking gross ewe
Boi what the hell is that phone
✝✝✝✝🙏🏻🙏🏻
well, compare to old movies remakes today miss the point of delivering the plot. you know, start with a creepy, thrilling scene then transition to wacky party hype all out happy people scene then suddenly it turns out to be a hunter and prey scene then goes the climax . and then the conclusion.
A landline? This is a nightmare indeed.
if they make a sequel to this, will it be called "Scream 2" ?
I cant find this scary after watching the whole saga of Scary Movies
Not really interested with the plot but just with the stabbings as this movie had been plotted so much over the years. It would be interesting though if Dewey is still in this franchise.
i could watch all of the screams all day Neve Campbell is my favourite she is so strong
It's not showing in my country😭😭😭😭
opening the front door in a situation like that is incredible stupid. All the scream movies are basically stupid people doing stupid things with stupid outcomes, very good representation of today's generation, fun to watch :)
1:16 Mom and daughter, I just know it. Please let there be a Scream 6 in the works.
Is the guy running away from Ghostface @1:32 telling Ghostface to wait while he runs???? :').
I like all the Scream movies, Now they going to do one movie.. I hope
I just watched it, An I think I give it a 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽. I like all the Scream
i really love all the old characters coming back. i've already watch this movie and its not bad for a movie which is being produced for 4 times. And i saw Neve Campbell there. Although she is older now, but she's still THE COOLEST GIRL EVER
Just watched it, one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen
bruhhh this movie came out on my bday and i wanted to watch it but my sis wasnt able to bring me when she said we would😭😭😭
LMFAOO YESS I CANT WAIT TO FINALLY WATCH A SCREAM MOVIE IN THEATRES 💥
Trailer better than the movie..
This movie was so boring 😫 allot of times the actions of the characters didn't make any sense, not like normal people would react in such situations... I walked out an hour into the movie & it almost has no story at all.. it could be described by "theres a killer in a mask & people get stabbed" not more to it 😂
Yes I watched it.. i mean it was January. All the good movies were not yet out.
Its remaind me scary movie 1
I love Laurie Strode, but Sidney Prescott will always be the best final girl to me.
Smh this is why I hate these kinds of movies there's a hospital scene where the lights go out and there are no nurses or doctors on the floor. Like really if anyone has ever been in a hospital there's no room to sleep without nurses or doctors coming to wake you up constantly like come on.
Tbh, it reminds me of another Halloween movie. All I know is I’m still excited to go see it tomorrow night. It just better be scary! 💯😌
اليوم شفته بالسينما😂😔؟
Just came from theater after I watched this movie ,, fucking TERRIFYING I only recommend strong hearts watch it   Ps ( I every scream but this is the best so sar )
Don't waste your money and time to watch this movie, poor acting. If there is only horror movie in the world left, still I would not watch it. Better to watch some porn for 2 hours and feel relaxed.
0:20 When I heard about a new Scream movie coming out, I was expecting to hear ghostface call people not jigsaw from the Saw movies.
I like how Scream changed the Horror film genre, it wasn't just some guy running around with super powers impervious to bullets
Um is that scream 5 or not
shit movie
These scream villains are regular humans but gun shot has no effect on them and they get to one place to another like they can teleport. Unrealistic for a character with no super power
2:06 helllloooooo 🔥
I love the movie
The most bullshet movie ever
Hope to see the movie tomorrow 🙌👌
Dont look a touch on the original
I watched it in the cinema it was so amazing
im going to see this to day im so exited!
I liked everything about this except the twist. They could’ve done so much better making it the main girl instead; it made sooo much sense. She was talking about narcotics she was taking and the literal first scene we see of her is her taking drugs. Then her seeing Billy all the time, it just would’ve made so much more sense of it was more of a split personality kinda thing of something.
Me too. Scream is my all time favourites. Really want to know who dum-dum gonna die knowing Sidney look down at them.....🤭😏
Wow! A Dead By daylight Live action! 😲
Movie was so shit😂😂 makes no sense
First R rated movie I ever saw was Scream back in the day. This one’s gna kick ass too
Courtney Cox face is basically the scream mask now.
Going to see this tonight !! im excited i am a huge fan of the classic movies this should be good!!
“I’m Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun”
My sister and her boyfriend gave up in the middle of the movie. I am so curious now.
wazzuupppppppppppppp
looks very very  wicked and so good:) never really got into the scream movies   this ones look very very good:) cant wait to take one of my sisters to see it this weekend and my mom  :)  or when they want hope this weekend
Yes
Courtney aged well
Generic_scream_mask_01.jpg
Scream 6 confirmed! I CAN'T WAIT!!!!
Super leuke filem
It should be called Scream 5.
They stole the mask in the background of the title from Halloween 2018
The boyfriend and the black haired friend are the killers and Duey dies 60 mins in. I Saved you 90 mins of your life. DW about thanking me
Что ж...мне нравится первая часть и раз Сидни не дают покоя, то будем смотреть
Anyone know how to watch this online?
BRING ON SCREAM 6 ..... NEXT YEAR
SCREAM 5 >>>>> HALLOWEEN KILLS
I remember thinking after the ending of scream 2, who will be Ghostface next?
a mi polola no le gustó
Well now I know which security system not to get
Excelente pelicula saludos #MonterreyNLMEXICO
I want more scream now. Not after 10 years please. Make it every year.
I don't like it, its too many F*** words for a young actress!!! not being cool to let teenagers to watch... they try the movie to looks good because those original actor & actresses played a part & that's ok...but I still like the original scream movie better...
monica
Oh my god l don’t know what people do
Ghost face did that shadow way better than Batman did
I hope paramount pictures make scream 6 through scream 100 without Michael myers having a turn i would love ❤️ to see that happen
#EvaLongoria❤️ for Sam and Tara's mom in #Scream6 🖤  Thumbs UP
Horror movies starting to look like comedies.
Annoying movie. Bad acting and everyone is crying the whole movie. Dont waste ur money.
I’m so happy they made a 5th one
it doesnt look like they know they are going to die even if thye killer is on top of them lol
The scariest part of this whole movie is that they for whatever reason still have a land line.
fuck this shit nice kurwa kutas
I'm crying 😢 Nearly 3 decades and a whole century later 😭 it's to much. The original director even passed. Please I hope this is good.
i absolutely LOVE this movie. so good !!!!!
Jesus christ
I just saw this movie like mayyyybe 15 minutes ago (in theaters lol - it’s kinda a coincidence to come across this 😂) and it was amazing man  ⚠️SPOILER ALERT⚠️       Man when Amber caught on fire at the end my mom was over here like “Barbecue anyone?” I started to die laughing lol 😂
It's a stupid movie. The villain woman was too thin to kill a former sheriff just like that lol. She even throw Dewy in the air. Hahaha. Wtf.
Amber and the boyfriend are the 2 killers.
The boyfriend is one of the killers.
I just saw this movie and it is terrible! The story is completly absurd. They say what the fans want in the movie, but they don't do it!! They also say what the fans don't like. And these people do exactly that!! Don't watch this movie, watch the first one!!
I was laughing at some scenes in the theatre. Modern horror movies are so cringe lol
I respect that their still going. But the story ended in scream 3. The story is over. But I have a theory. Scream 4 is really stab 3. It’s was made bad on purpose because it’s stab 3. The movie they were shooting in scream 3
Knew it was Richie I just had a bad vibe off him, he just was off. And why is Amber so chill about saying Ghostface used her phone to call Tara before. Like why are you not worried about your phone? And Richie are Amber were picking on eachother during it when they were both the murderers. Great movie though.
Worst garbage want money back now
I want my money back bad everything worst I've seen.
After more than 20 years and I still want to sleep with neve Campbell. I’ll most definitely make her scream in a good way😉
What scared me the most about this movie was how much Courteney Cox fuuuuucked up her face with plastic surgery
The worst movie I have ever seen in my life.... Fak that director.... He ruined my first date 🖕🖕🖕
yeah
I loved the movie
This movie was absolutely amazing!!! Love how they picked this actors. The plot was awesome, funny, and thrilling!!   Love love love
This movie is absolute trash. Worse by the minute.

It looks good but seriously they should of just rebooted it with all new cast and a new location.  Scream four was more like a comedy slasher. This to me this is a remake of scream four but this time the scary scenes do not make you laugh.
Me is scared
Might be going to see this in theatres tomorrow. Looks really good. Loved the first 4 movies so I'm sure I'll love this one. Scream is definitely my favourite horror franchise ever. Looking forward to seeing the movie.
I remember the original made me soooo nervous to be in a bathroom stall alone, forever afraid someone was going to stab me through the head! 🤣🤷🏻‍♀️
HERE AFTER SCREAM 6 ANNOUNCEMENT. ❤️
Brenda Meeks and Shorty meeks are just like The twins
G 6th is the only day I have a job that is the only 🙃 that is the only thing 😅 to be a great place and
The trailer is to much spoiling!

Movie is absolute trash.
I don’t think this will happen but if the killers name is reviled to be mo-foken Jed Olsen I’m gonna…    Scream.
What the fuck n when the the fuck .. So chilling .good one
ahhh...neve still looks fresth as a flower...shes aged sexily and gracefully...courtney looks fuckin old..but film seems interesting..slash cut rip...nice..kill them all let GOD sort them out...har har har
soooooo scared
I wanth the movie the killer is Amber and Sem's boyfriend (Richi)
I hope in next scream 6, children this time fight and chase ghostface,they captured the kids/youths after a brief chase... 🙏🙏 Love from fan🇵🇭🤗
Please can you get the back on please
This movie was a waste of time and money 👎🏾 very disappointed!
Clay Jensen in here about to loose his shit on scream. That was a terrible joke
great movie wowwwwww paramount plus !!
Is Scream supposed to be cliche?
Its been a decade
Can i watch it even if i haven't seen the others?
130 million and counting. SREAM 6 CONFIRMED! Killing it!
at least he complies and wears a mask lol
Wassup!! good shit
Does anyone remember how [originally] S3 was the Finale...? No...? It's ok. Me neither.👌👍
I definitely won’t share this opinion but I want the next one to just be like no more games he just goes on a fkn spree and maybe even finally kill Sydney or gale
I dream of an american future where asking someone if they have a gun is a dumb question.
Love it 👻🔪🩸
Look my Strava !
Sooo... I liked it but It is forgettable. Three things that annoyed me and made this movie mediocre IMHO 1. Why are hospitals so dark? is that common in the USA? And there are no other patients or staff? You have a private hospital with no other patients and no electricity? Cutting the power in a hospital is really not easy. And if it would be easy, there is always an emergency generator.. So this doesn't make sense... Not only in this movie though, many shows and movies use this... pretty weird and annoying...   2. another hospital thing : when the 4 people are attacked by Ghostface. They knock Ghostface out and then THEY RUN AWAY!!! You have been there 4 times Sidney/Dewey. You knock Ghostface out, you take away their mask I think in scream 2 Sidney already mentioned that... They didn't do it now, and well... we know what happened after they knocked Ghostface out....   3. The ending. Okay, you killed the people, you got the last surviving people in a corner... Why do you talk and explain? Yes, I know the audience wants motives, but don't stop the killing. Wait untill there is one left if you need to explain why you killed all those people...  ugh really... by that time I just really wanted the movie to be over and done with. The final 15 minutes felt like 3 hours and that is not a good thing... maybe I am too old for these movies.. I dont know... It was better than scream 4 though and yes, if there is gonna be a scream 6, there is a 99% chance I'll watch it.
Oh wow Scream is always great movie.
Jenna ortego thoooo
Do not watch this is shit movie
V 1 billon viewsoila babyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Who is watching this in 2022!?!?! 😂
Why did they just call it Scream? It’s like they’re embarrassed they’ve made so many of these movies or something.
I watched it today and it was good! I cried, and that ending wow
I want to go watch it in a cinema but scream 2 comes to my mind
As soon as I saw the characters, I knew who wasn’t the killer! That was a no brainer!
As a fan, my ranking from most fav to least fav; 1) Scream  2) Scream 4 3) Scream 2022 4) Scream 2 5) Scream 3
Eh yo Pick up the Phone      "WAAAZZUUUUUP"
What a terrible movie, so many thibgs wrong
After i saw scary movie when i was a Child that mask doesnt seem so scary now , isnt it ?
I think this is dexter morgan.
Sydney prescot
i skipped school and went to see this alone and was the only one in the theater lol
i don’t get why it’s not just called scream 5
This movie was trash & very boring. The actors were also terrible & the acting was horrendous. Don’t even get me started with the fight scenes. I rarely write negative reviews on movies but this was a 2/10 movie
I have watched this movie in the theater and I believe it is a great movie tho the acting is kinda bad I would rate the movie 9/10 it's 2 hours long
it’s scary until u find out who the killers are then u like oh ok
To bad Gale couldn't have swallowed Dufus, I mean Dewy, back to life, or maybe tried using a vacuum cleaner on him.  P.S. Gale swallows.😙😚😙😚😙😚😂😂😂
They should do another comedy movie to this called squeal.
Where can I find the whole movie of scream 5 with Greek subs ? Or at least English?
i got bored hands down?
Man with Mask and kitchen knife ..  😅
And psychopaths after watching these kind of movies turning in to a real life psychopath
Idk but the killer is pretty cute tho
Gale Wheathers supposed to be dead, right? She was shot at the stomach by Amber but yet in the end she still can walk and sit comfortably beside Sid?
I was disappointed with the casting of this movie and plot was too much like the first movie. The casting was trying to copy the Euphoria cast, but with some bad actors. The Euphoria cast members could’ve been several people in this movie.
fire movie
I SAW IT
Absolute garbage movie. The girl killer overacted, the storyline was trash, the group of friends were acting like they were in some high school musical. Cheesy acting. I wish I could unsee this.
Wassssssuuuuupppppp!!!!!
The movie is a hommage to Wes Craven.  He probably roles himself over in his grave for this piece of junk.  I hope they payed the actors from scream 96 a lot of money to show up in this disasterpiece.
I’ve not watched the pre ones do I need to watch them to understand this one ?
The killer is the BF and Amber, officer doofy dies.
Watching Scream in theaters was one of the best last minute decision I pulled
Thanks for movie. I m a big fan  this movie😊😊😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩
Or someone else
I think it's Billy's dad
This killer in the movie is new this person said how nice to finally meet u so again dk who this one is but not seeing it in theaters is safe I'll wait for it to be on a website for free and then watch it's safer
Think I've seen the whole film in this 2;19
How many people does it take before Sidney snaps!!!
I'm 35 yrs old I don't understand why this is continuing the 1st one was the boyfriend and friend the 2nd one was the boyfriend mom and friend the 3rd one was the half  brother the 4th one was the cousin
I’m terrified man-
Seen it tonight, it was great!!
dam courtney cox looks awful
I love jenna ortega 😍😍
This movie sucks
Weak
very good movie saw it last week and the storyline was on point
The man constantly trips over everything, yet no one can kill him. How is this a movie and why do people watch it? Either these people fight like stormtroopers or this movie franchise is complete garbage.
Finally something to be afraid of that won't actually 'hurt' us.  Psyched.
Vaah kya movie hai yaar
No Mr. Mojo jojo don’t kill me i wanna be in the sequel! 🥺
This is definitely the true sequel to the original and I can’t believe the party in Stu’s house also the memorial for Randy was really nice
I'm sorry the movie sucks. Such a disappointment since I'm a huge fan of the classic scream movies. This one had bad actors who didn't know how to act, a mediocre plot and filming was so dry, no thrill, no suspense, no dramatic music.
Bro, just loop then drop a pallet, better yet, just run Spine Chill
Oh I'm seeing this today
DUDE I WAS LATE TO THE CINEMA FOR THIS MOVIE LIKE 15 MINUTES BUT ME AND MY OLD FRIEND DROVE FAST THEN THEY WERE LIKE, ''Sorry, It's for 18 and older only'' BRUH I WATCHED MANY THINGS LIKE THIS😭😭
Worst movie this one and old ones too
Totally shit movie
I saw it.  In short. The first is  awesome of course, 2,3 are really great, Scream 4 is too and the new is not very good. I think that Scream 4 would have been perfect  to pay tribute to Wes Craven.
Eanjirrrrr jadi gua yang ngerii
Eanjirrrrr jadi gua yang ngerii
2:14 is that supposed to be chuckys laugh? Lol sounds similar
Rip officer dookie
classic early 2000s nostalgia
I have the scream trilogy on DVD it has scream 1'2'3 scream 4 was also crazy. All the scream movies are hardcore!!!! I haven't seen the new one yet, but I might check it out at the movie 🎥🍿 threater if it's available. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
in the last movies there was i get why she says it feels different\
Back in #Stu_Macher's house.
Modern scary movies have nothing on this
Honestly, this movie restored my hope in Thriller (slasher films) again. The Scream franchise, you're doin great honey.
Farrrk i can't wait! 90s come at me bro!!!
جفته في السينما قوي الفلم 😍🖤.
Its the boyfriend of course
Does anyone have a link to watch it for free???
Wish the film would've had more character development. The trailer had me super excited and I somehow feel a bit let down. I heard that the film had to scrap about 30 mins, which probably led to it feeling less developed.
I watched the movie today. It was amazing!!! 👏
would you like to play a game tera     John Kramer: Thats my line
how in the actual fuck will this trash be a game changer when they already made like 4 other shit movies that are the same
I’m so excited!! I saw the very first Scream in theaters and it scared the hell out of me
1:40 I didn't realize Chris Benhoit was back from the dead. 🤣
Compared to screams previous movies tho awful
I think we can all admit 2021 was the best year we got so much games and movies can’t wait to see what we get for 2022
Hello Sindy it’s an honor that part was so bad ass of ghost face to say
Bad writing  Bad acting  No chasing scenes  Not enough scenes of Gale and Sidney  Dewey stupid death ( how can tiny amber lift him up with 2 knives ?)  No suspence Its like comedy  Boring characters  Killers too obvious   Rip Wes Craven
Its a stupid movie...i hate every second of it.The Script is stupid as fuck...
Dewey is all "I'm getting too old for this shit"
these remakes are worst then video game movies. change my mind.
yea i just seeen the movie. love the credits where they used Wallows music cause of him
best. i love this!!
Do yourself a favor and don’t watch it… just wasted my time watching this trash.
Ah, Wes. Your vision and direction was sorely missed.
Is this a sequel from movie 4?
Well, it is obvious who the killer is, if you watched the latest Tarantino movie...
The best part.... Of coure Sidney   Neve Prescott Campbell
I love this movie sm
This is lame. Why would she just open the door at night and she is a lone in the house.
The Best Movie 2022👍👍👍👍👍
Scary Movie totally ruined this for me
I watched this in Sunday and until the end i thought this is going to be best Scream movie after the original.However i don't like the motives killers used for cause to kill people.Anyway i think this is going to be highest grossing movie so far.
This movie was incredible
Doses anyone knows when this movie will drop?
'Scary Movie'. 🤣
First ever girl to survive the opening scene. Definitely thought she was gonna die lol.
Watched it 2nite. The killer is that guy that has the shirt that looks like the chicks cousins uncle who has the mullet and drives the old camaro. He is screwing the girls stepmother and she's the one with the weird limp that gnashed her teeth and bit the recess ladys breast. Yall enjoy!!!
I absolutely love that the core cast has been in EVERY single one! That makes this one of the best scary movies that can keep making movies and they are all good!
Great movie

Garbage
This movie is basically a upgraded version of scary movie.. Lol
I wanna watch the movie already dammit
I was 7 when the first Scream came out in 96, I wonder if this new one will actually be any good
Great movie.  The 2nd best Scream movie so far ......FIRE FIRE 🔥
I don't know why I'm smiling, may be because of scary movie.
Very Very to meet your friend 😊 😀 I
Seems like it’s pretty much the same plot line to the new Halloween movie. Scary man comes back, the now middle aged/old victims gang up to end it once and for all.
im done watching it. such of wasting my time and money 😃 non thrill and boring for me .
What app can I watch this on?.....
This movie was so garbage lol
The plot suuuuuuuuuuuuuucked!
I saw this movie it was more funny then scary and kinda sad
whatsaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!
Neve Campbell is somehow even hotter in her late 40's.
SCREAM 5 >>>>>> HALLOWEEN KILLS
Doofy
Movie was trash. I’m o disappointed
❤️❤️❤️
i went to see this move yesterday the characters were so dumb
Let's hope they can take this home..
Just watched it - love it! I’d recommend watching all of them before the new one. I was doing Screamathon the other night!
this is a "Helloween Kills" rip off
I wish for sedny to die in  this episode damn it she is never die lol
0:24 why the fuck did she open the door?
I WENT AND WATCHED IT IN THE THEATERS TODAY WITH MY FRIEND, IT WAS AMAZING I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE-
not scary but an okay movie
Shouldn’t it be Scream IV, instead of just Scream?
Looks like poop covered in plastic surgery lol 🥴
I want the Remake of scary movie part 1😂😂😂😂😂😂
Somebody tell to do a remake of scary movie with this guy again.but i want similar like the part 1
I want a new scary movie remake with this bad guy again🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
One more comment Dewey Riley is the king of cheating death cheers to David Arquette for playing a lovable protector character DEWEY forever in our hearts
Lmfao are you serious? I’m sure nothing will be predictable in this one lol 😂 come on Hollywood , get some original ideas
Agent Kincaid is the true ghostface mastermind
Agent Kincaid is the true ghostface mastermind
Bad bad boring movie!! I just waste my time pfff…. /:
Release date??
This movie is literally shit. It’s so bad. 4/10. That death fucked it all up.
Do not waste your money ..
Idk If This A Spoiler Or Not But It Was Better Than How I Expected It… One Of Killer’s Was Obvious 🙄 I Enjoyed The Killings Tho
Great movie but honestly the trailer sucks and does the movie no favors at all
I don’t understand how they changed out of the GhostFace costume so quickly, also where did they keep it? How can someone be stabbed multiple times and not have the knife hit multiple organs? In the hospital scene, how did the cop not hear Sam screaming in the break room? In the other hospital scene when GhostFace is after Tara while she’s crawling, where were all the other patients and hospital staff? Hospitals are usually always filled with people. Why wasn’t Wes’s mom armed? Isn’t she a cop and off-duty cops are still armed? In the end with the party at Pam’s house, what kind of house has that many closets??? Overall, I still enjoyed the movie and thought it was entertaining.
Not a classic but it was fun.
cool movie bro
📵 Two killers Amber & Kirsch 📵📵
As a background actor in this movie I think it turned out pretty good
I would go see this but I can’t stand Melissa
Don’t waste your time on this movie. I am a big fan of the scream franchise and this was horrible. The majority of the cast can’t act to save their lives. The main protagonist (not Sydney) is an air head and pretty weak. She is probably the worst actress in the whole lot. You hardly see Sydney, Gale or Dewey. And the killers motive is the most stupidest reason ever. I wouldn’t have minded a new lead if they actually made her interesting and a great actress, but truly you could of ended the franchise with the 3rd or 4th and you wouldn’t be missing out on anything. Gen Z, or at least posing as Gen Z, ruined this movie! The only younger generation I liked was Jenna Ortega. In my opinion, if they made her the protagonist this movie would have been a lot better. At least she can act!
No idea how it got good scores. It was so fcking bad
Todos os filmes do pânico são iguais
Saw this it was a great movie recommend seeing it.
The WORST of all the Scream movies. I mean, not. not the movie but the killer identity and motive is the WORST of all the movies. Seriously... there could have been so much better potential and you came with a shitty movie ending... I mean :   Scream 1 : billy's motive was to kill sidney because he want revenge about her mother who slept with his father, resulting in his mother to leave and abandon them  Scream 2 : Billy's mom motive was revenge because she killed his son  Scream 3 : Sidney's brother motive was revenge because his mother abandoned him and acted like she never recognize him and having only one child which is sidney.  Scream 4 : Sidney's cousin motive was revenge because sidney became so famous and she wanted to have the same amount of glory as her cousin  Scream 5 : 2 random people with no direct link to sidney, and their motive was just because they wanted to make a good sequel because they hate how all the sequel are bad these days.... SERIOUSLY?????  Imagine, we could have seen a 3rd killer reveal and that would have been STU! He was out of jail few months ago (or escaped) and he was their mentor an the one behind all these killing because he wanted to continue what was made 25 years ago like he was stuck at this time in his head..  Or, sidney could have an abandoned child that she got my billy years ago and then he want revenge for being abandoned and the lost of his father...  Well.. there was so many potential and you decided to have 2 people doing this for stupid reasons?? I hope you come back with a good Scream 6 lol
That's why I don't have smart locks
Will it release in hindi ??????
Посмотрел ужастик Крик...😧😈 Вдруг развился нервный тик...😕😭 Пусть сюжет и предсказуем...😒😌 Всё равно с него кайфуем!!!😜
So basically some weirdo with a knife cant be killed by guns? lol
This looks like it should just be on Netflix ngl
Aka what happen when you have gun control
I'm never scared by a masked man killing girls, I WANT MONSTERS
One of the shites movie ever... Maybe because of Covid Hollywood is getting worst 🤣I am watching this stupid movie and giving the review at the same time.
One of the corniest movies I seen and if you like to jump out of your seat to leave the theatre then this is the movie
Something bout this one just feels different.... ultra terrifying....😱
Scream 22.  We have smartphones  and web3 now.  😄
I'm finally done watching this movie, it was worth to watch this..
boring
clay jensen got jelous and kept hairstyle like alex standall
Pause it @2:02 and you can see the killer is a male with brown hair. looks like dewey
this went from something funny to a cringe piece of shit. scary movie was good so wtf is this garbage?
im still feels the 90s vibes
AMBER got SHOT but can hold up a party looking good. sidney and Gale both got shot n stabbed but just given a freaking blanket at the end of the story... WHERE'S THE SENSE?!
Can I get this in TAMIL language please😓
Take away the scary noise effects and this would be 50x better
I watch it to day at the movie theater I was so scared I jumped like 7 Times a something
Wouldn't a person have a gun these day
😍😍😍😍😍😍
i seen it in theaters today, 10/10 recommend
Yah this movie was complete garbage. Just like the rest.
Que maldita mielda
Going to see it tonight, excited
Just watched it , it’s classic and as always the old way stays gold
I loved it. Great entry to the franchise and to me the second best so far after the original.
too many stupid movies,,period,,with all this STUPID VIOLENCE goin on all over the COUNTRY,,,can they make some fun ,smart movies ,,HUHHH,,just read the article about an idiot who got arrested ,,getting the stupid idea from this stupid movie,,,arrested was Logan Smith,,from ,,you guessed it Florida,,,brevard county
SonicWhacker55 showed us this trailer and all I’m gonna say is. Bring it on XD
I can't get over how funny the door scene is, with them locking and unlocking  Edit: it was just as funny, in the movie itself
Dead by Daylight  Ghost Face 🔪
Durk was a great person and 5th time for me to have the same as the other guy I have a great personality and a great

Dezolant film

Jeri stvarno nekome ovo strasno
Horror films rules: 1 have a weapon, gun is the best 2 make sure got a good working phone 3 make sure you are a good runner 4 barrage yourself in a room from the killer.
u guys should watch this SCREAM movie. I swear... the cinematic of this new franchise is absolutely terryfying during watchin!
Pretty sick movie
Trailer would have spoiled the movie for me, so glad I didn’t see the trailers before the movie
Hello Sidney!    Wazzuhhhh!
1:14
1:01
O my godh i havent watched yet 😮
Bagus sekali filmnya
Omg...so scary😱
Is cool 😎 🔥
So scary😱
Looks garbage. Casting is so bad now a days. Generic, boring people. Film looks like cheap crap. What is wrong with you producers.
This is so good I just got out the movies from watching this
Don't bring a gun in a slasher thriller. Get a machete, sword, or katana, or something. All of those pwn a puny knife.
Imagine having a landline in 2022.
RICHIE (the boyfriend) & AMBER ARE THE KILLERS hehehe
Satan is alive and well in 2022. He knows his days are numbered. 🙏 🤲
Well, with the title they replicated one of the dumbest things they possibly could about Halloween 2018. If anything can be said for the 2018 abomination called Suspiria, it's that at least it's some kind of a remake.
Best movie ever
Jake Krantz brought me here
i watched it and it was so good💞
if the girl in the beginning actually dies, i  would like a refund
Wazzuppp 😝
Lol the haters really came to the trailer to the complain 💀 this the only place ive ever seen them too
For the love of Christ. This movie was shit. I LOVE the franchise but honestly they had WAY TOO MUCH to work with and it still somehow turned out terrible, boring characters, like the weakest and lowest kill count of the whole franchise, the acting wasn’t great, the OG characters were basically pointless, THE WORST MOTIVE IVE EVER SEEN FOR A “slasher”. Bad editing, and so on. Like that’s my opinion but in all honesty I don’t even understand how people can possibly compare this to the first one. That’s an insult.
But Nothing could beat the iconic opening Drew Barrymore scene..
I love how the trailer just gave us all straight spoilers
Bro this movie was so boring, very predictable, no logic  , and a terrible story, literally the only way you can like this movie is by be a fan of scream
I’m glad I didn’t watch this trailer before I saw the movie
Scariest thing about this by far was Courtney Cox's facelift.
It was ok I was expecting more twist to the more of Sidney and gale and ghost face going after them something from there past hoping dewy would be the killer idk it was.okay movie super corny
Wazzzzaaappp.Fuck scary movie destroyed my fear..🤣🤣🤣
It wasn't that good. Highly predictable. Part 4 was better.
yall really need to let this franchise drop.
The movie is good the NEPOTISM is bad. Jake Quaid as the lead? Really? So forget about the 160k out of work actors in SAG and just cast someone famous' kid... cool. Nice.
so bad movie i don't like it sorry guys
I hate that dewey got killed by that lame girl
This is stupid😂 The killers are too obvious lol😅
monica galler
i wanna cast in the next scream movie and i wanna put my own money into it and create a lot of gory scenes and bring more to the movies because the franchise just cannot die out, but i want me to cast in it so bad because i wanna be ghostface and reveal myself in the end to Sydney and i want to be the only one in the franchise to actually kill one of the main chracters (either Gale or Sydney) and bring shock and anger to everyone, i also want to have the movie super gory like 10 times more gory than this one and 10 times more gory than scream 4, i want the story to change and make it look like the ghostface in scream 6 is trying to twist the original by bringing in a new weapons that contains 4 different kind of blades all conjoined into a tire iron. I want the ghostface which i can only hope is me does this fake dying scene that shows me getting slaughtered and then reveal myself in the end and have everyone watching in shock, i also want because the next ghostface is trying to twist the original by bringing in different things i want Sydney to kill me and then say “you don’t fuck with the original” line again. But i am in need of a lot of gore and a lot of kills that none of which are just plain stabs or gunshots all need to be gory (ik i spelled sidney wrong my keyboard automatically changes it to Sydney)
o nice
Hey I thought scream had a long pickaxe ⛏
The same lame movie redone with smartphones. Same plot same formula. Milking the franchise. What kind of idiots watch these movies. There needed be no more stupid scream movies. Lame.
I’m just hearing about this and excited as shit!
Dewey gets killed by a gay teenager chick who looks like she has down syndrome?? LAME AF
heyy
SPOILERS AHEAD ;’)  So if u have noticed the only reason why Chad survived and Liv died is she just didn’t get shot in the head before that was when Liv and Chad were about to do it, Chad refuses while Liv complains.  So if you remember from scream 1, they said one of us the rules is no sex, including no drugs and stuff. THATS THE REAL REASON. Liv died and Chad survived. Actually Chad should be dead also cause he got stabbed 6 times stayed there on the ground for a hour, then he is still awake alive going to the hospital. Makes no sense. Also gale hot shot, and stabbed, and Sindy got stabbed, so I’m confused how at least Gale and Chad didn’t die.
I watched it and omg!!! it blew my mind that Dewey was ghostface since the beginning 😱
I watched with my Mom, I was freaking out!!! She laughed at me 😭💔🤣
This movie was ASS... 1,2,4,3,5    Ranked from best to worst
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s

look at my pfp.
This gonna be one of the best movie in 2022
is that monika from friends?
Eu já assisti esse filmes 3 vezes no cinema e não me canso. Que filme PERFEITO meu Deus. Wes Craven deve estar muito feliz com a proporção desse novo filme. Os roteiristas e os diretores estão de parabéns por criar, homenagear e reviver uma saga tão icônica e perfeita. Foi a primeira vez que consegui assistir um filme da franquia nos  cinemas. Tenho os 4 filmes em DVD e com certeza já estou esperando o lançamento deste para a minha coleção. Obrigado por trazer mais um capítulo Paramount Pictures... espero que venham mais e mais. 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
İch kann den film nicht ernstnehmen seit scary movie😂
My first time watching a movie from the franchise in theater. Fucking loved every second of it. Thank you Neve Campbell for being ICONIC
im sorry... after i watched this movie... my honest review was JUST OKAY... i love SCRE4M more... 😬😬😬
im watching it on monday with my closest friends!
Not recommend. Terrible movie. 👎
Hello Sidney!
I said dont disturb me while im cleaning my room 😂
could have been awesome with the right cast this looks so uninteresting and boring ugly cast all inclusive boring trash!!
As an background actor in this movie, I am just incredibly proud of the way this movie turned out. The on set experience was just a blast, and it was really weird to see myself and hear myself on screen, in a good way. The movie itself I loved in general, and as a fan of the franchise, it’s an honor to contribute to this film, especially considering it’s the first movie I was ever an extra in
the first ten minutes ain't actually scary
There were lots of victims from this movie, starting with those who had to pay tickets to watch it.
House has pretty good wifi.
👍👍👍👍👍👍💪💪💪💪💪
I like this movie
What a joke
The trailer is better than the film itself.
👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻👻
Terrible.
This do be looking scary tho
Yo i wanted to see this on my bday but I couldn’t
Didn't watch any trailers before I saw this film, and I must say, Hollywood strikes again by showing everything in the trailer!!!
“I’m Sidney Prescott of course I have a gun” damnnnnn
0:03 LOL I have that same cordless phone!! Too funny
Ah shit here we go again
Jada pinkett and Omar Epps (scream 2) were of no relation to any of the previous victims.. (they were black)  just tha same 1st or last name. Can’t change a premise, and say they were all related to a victim. 😂😂
Why Billy was appearing as a ghost Jedi to give strength to Sam?
I saw this movie yesterday
Neve Campbell is charming as usual. miss her presence!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Also am I the only one who thinks they saw a quick glimpse of Jeffery Epstein in the movie like right as they were arriving to Wes’s home after the kill??? Idk maybe I was seeing things.
I went to see this on opening night and needless to say I am really disappointed in the script and cast for this movie it was even worse than the 4th one and I thought it couldn’t get any worse. It was not necessary, neither was Scream 4 we didn’t need it because we had already found out why Sidney’s mom was killed, who did it and why(so we thought) and we saw Billy’s mom get revenge and finally we find more about Maureen and the secrets she had and just what/who really really got her killed in Scream 3 and that should’ve been the end but it wasn’t unfortunately. By the trailer they made it seem like someone from the past was going after them when in reality it’s the opposite and just the same concept as Scream 4. All in all it was a waste of film and time.
how many time are you gonna make the same movie over and over again..
Crazy how Dewey went from awkward dorky kid with a pencil mustache to rugged badass looking dude
This was so fucking stupid, what a waste of 2 hours lmfao
This gonna be AWSOMEEE!!
Man this movie was brutal and I'm still hurting but I can't wait to watch it again
What the fuck is up with youtube nerds “the chills” like wtf thats all i ever read “i saw his mask and omggerd chilllllls” 😂😂😂😂
Guys, should I watch the previous movies before going to this film??
Rewatching this trailer after seeing the movie is interesting. You can see how they recontextualized footage and even spliced two lines together in order to hide a big spoiler. Well done.
this feels weird is like seeing the 80s trailer horror movie tipe in 2022 without special effects or cgi in the villain
IM SCARED
One more reason to not keep digital lock for doors. 😂
I want to sneak into an r rated movie
I don’t know who the girl is at the start ... but she is amazing and sucked me in. Her part gave me goosebumps, I hope she doesn’t get killed 1st
Ce masca are ma bufnește râsu🤣🤣
And that's why you shouldn't be able to unlock all doors with your phone...
This movie was surprisingly great lol
After the matrix, this is yet another disappointment, prequels sequels, requels, they are all shit! I'm gonna stop going to the theaters altogether.👎 For this scream requel 🐂💩.
19 MİL WİEW OMG IM BİG FANN PLSS MORE SCREAM
ITS MY CHİLDHOOD I CANT WAİTTTTT
OH My LorDy LoRd, iT HaS The SaME ActOR In ThE OriGINaL mOVieS 😱
I can't wait for my daughter to watch this in theaters.i know she's going to like it😁
Some of the writing was a bit cringe but I give it a 7.5/10 especially the killers motives were cringey but also sadly realistic in this time and age
i have watched this and it was very very cool!!
CANT WAITTTTTTTT. YESSSSSSS
now that i know what happens in the movie congrats to the editor of this video. i thought it was all about sydney
я смотрел в кино
Just saw it in theatre, fockin unpredictable
That voice still makes me scared 20 years later
Throws backs are cool, this is lazy and dum-b
😍😍😍
0/10. I won't even begin to write the chapter book of how bad modern horror has become...
Saw it today, it was okay I kinda expected more, more backstories or something, I think my expectations were a bit too high tho..
Seriously doors controlled by phone?, soo isthe battery is gone you're done, What's with the dependence on cellphones?Bank accounts, face recognition, fingerprints, Just let the terminators take over already
Wonder why not on peacock a probably be 4 months before on demand
for those of you who have already seen it, should i watch the first screams first? im going to see it tonight but i haven't watched any of the first ones.
just cring how duwy dies he was one of the best yk
This re-quel of a movie is a TOTAL FAILURE. Not really a remake or a sequel. Its recycled junk. Not even bringing the original cast could save this trainwreck of a film. Save your money and don't watch this garbage.
ماكو عربي هينا
This is going to be fire 🔥
fucking same Bullshit
Seen this movie last night at the theater and I loved it ! Brought back all the main characters from the first one! Had a real twist at the end. Best horror reboot I seen
1:26 this badass looking scene with the giant shadow on the wall isn´t even in the movie!!
I just saw this move it was so good I cry 💕
Recycled garbage.
I'm gonna watch it today 😃
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱❤
I’m gonna watch it tommorow❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍 Wish me luck everyone!
Il htim bciss
i cant wait for them to redo the final destination lol miss this kind of good old movies
Courtney Cox,  surgery gone wrong , she was a good looking woman , pretty sad .
Went to see this in cinema  just awful, predicatble and generic blockbuster,  think I might I stick to Independent cinema 🎥 😀
Wazzup.........
This looks just as corny as the first one.
Saw it. It sucked
Do you have a gun?  We still have the second amendment.
This movie was f'in great!
this looks hilarious, can't wait to watch it
عشاق Scream من الوطن العربي
Side note.. Neve Campbell is ageing like a fine wine!! 🔥🔥
YESSSSS YESSSS DIBA
EY EY EY FIRST BOX OFFICE OF THE YEAR CONGRATS TO US SCREAM FANS
סרט מטורף
this scream movie is better than the 4th one
if people are mixed on steam 5 they will probably love scream 6 . that’s exactly what happened to 3 most people hated it & then scream 4 comes out & mostly everyone loves 4  people are weird
Saw this movie premiere night, I don't think it's as good as the OG but it's up there with Scream 4! It was, in my opinion a great film to start 2022 that pays homage to Wes Craven after his unfortunate passing. I also loved the easter eggs scattered about and the new cast was a lot of fun. My only complaints were how cliché the character Samantha felt and the "act 3" of the film. In my opinion, they could have chosen better killers and I predicted one of them correctly the day I saw the trailer. However, their motivation was a lot more interesting. Still a solid movie and one I'd recommended you'd go out and see if you haven't already. Scream (2022) is one movie that will probably stab the hell out of the box office, and for good reason.  Solid 8/10 movie in my book.
love all the other screams but this one was rubbish to much comedy no horror at all lot more the party and women kissing rubbish actors and the film was worst one its finished i think they  they shouldnt make no more screams
I seen it tonight. In my opinion, this is the best one out the franchise.
A rip off from Halloween kills or takin notes from Halloween kills  😂😂😂😂 felt more like a feminist movement scream!
Dewey is going to be 1 of the killers
I want the scream story to focus on one of stu's relatives getting revenge on Sydney
نريد جزء سادس
Just finished watching it and Idek wtf happened to the red head
Yall need to stop it lol it's so predictable when she says you know when you yelling at the TV to the character to get the F out go and he stays lol I yelled in the theater he's 1 of the killers !!!
BRING BACK STU FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!! That would be HUGE and it's what the fans want!!! I'd go see it 3 times and buy the bluray.
im waiting "scary movie" parody this movie again
Ashamed how the first girl got stuck in the middle
The scary movies have just spoiled this franchise for me😁cant find it serious anymore
I want a new Freddy Krueger.
I don't think anyone could pay me enough to sit and watch that!
Poor Neve Campbell...
When I saw this trailer in the theater someone in the crowd went “OOOOO” when it played the sound at 2:14, really well done and got me excited to watch it (glad it turned out great!)
Ya no va adar risa
Looks like a bad joke and a sad attempt at making a few quick bucs. Don’t ruin a classic
Can't Wait To Watch It!
I hope this is the ending to this series. They were right Hollywood is running out of ideas. SmH 🤦🏾‍♂️  This movie was terrible. 🤦🏾‍♂️
God this movie was so awful. Even the 4dx theater couldn’t help it.
Watched the movie and it was pretty funny not scary, Funny because it was hella childish...
Serious question, even tho the OGs are in it, did they fuc up a classic or is this shit tight???
The best one was the one with emma Duvall in it
Yes
Hi
It just a rip off version of scream why would anyone pay money for remakes it dosent make any sense are you that dum
So this is basically the final destination 2 version of scream.   New cast, new story. Same problem and the woman from the original will come help and spread knowledge about whats going on to try to keep people alive.
I just watched this yesterday it’s pretty gory
Classic modern who done it
Who’s here after “Scream” Dethroned “Spider Man No Way Home ” ?   Y’all think it’s an W or L 😪 ?
wow it remainds me school ages. On carnival always wearing scream uniform and there was a heart that when you press that pumped blood in the mask :P
Courtney Cox has aged/surgeried poorly, the complete opposite of Neve Campbell.
I keep coming back to the trailer even tho I saw the movie 3 times! Lol
Waiting for Scary Movie to appear again!
I can’t believe Dewey died A mess everybody die to but Wes died🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🥺🤬🥺🥺🥺😖😖😖💕💕💕😥😥😥😥😥😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😢😢🤭😑😑🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭😬😬😬🥴😮‍💨😮‍💨😲😲😮😮😧😧
Rate 10/10
But this time he's much more scarier than before
Our bro came back yeeaah!
Coming back after watching the movie, I really enjoyed it. Hopefully they can continue with this and keep it up and not make a trash fire like the 2011 one again
Called one of the killers the day this trailer was released, pun fully intended
What’s next final destination 6 sweet  The nostalgia of the early 2000s horror movies back to life
Since scream came back. Then Hello new scary movie 😃
Was going to see this movie today but saw they put clay from 13 reasons. Now no TY haha do better movie makers. Please n thanks
they said this trailer would be misleading.... not sure if i agree
Already went to the theater for this movie three times.    Each time with a different group, and it Felt like I was seeing it for the first time. This season was great, my second favorite after the first original one. Still asking and looking for a group or friend, maybe even a date, to take to this movie again. Someone? Anyone? Everything on me, The ride there, the tickets, popcorn, I’ll even get you something to drink. So, what do you say?
sick trailer
Movie is Complete horse wank not worth wasting your time
Slashers are back and super hero movies sucks.
Really apreciate tara acting she really the best
This is better than Halloween movie
ΤΙ ΔΟΥΛΕΙ ΕΧΕΙ Ο ΜΑΡΚΟΣ ΑΠΟ ΤΟ ΕΥΤΙΧΙΣΜΕΝΟΙ ΜΑΖΙ ΣΤΟ SCREAM?
Watched it last night . The new characters are related with the old ones . The killings are a bit more dramatic than the old movies . I was expecting it to be more interesting, but kinda disappointed. Only one sad scene that got me upset. Rather than that It’s not worth it at cinema . Probably better on Netflix . Was happy to see Courtney Cox playing with  her x husband.
This felt like a parody
I think it's Sydney daughter or son
you lost me at someone being dumb and lazy enough to have door locks be automated.
What a joke, really!!!!!?????  It shows that the writers have ran out of good endings and stories to continue the sequels.  Just as the new HALLOWEEN movie had to much comedy to be a HORROR movie in my opinion 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Neahh....just like matrix 4...just like halloween...just like venom 2...boring.
Seen it the white girl with black hair is the killer
Are the films linked?
Hello Sidney 🤣
anjing😭😭😭
it’s so good.
Spoiler alert: people die
Still not scary enough to shit my pants
Courtney looked like Bruce Jenner in this
They could have saved the money for this cause the entire plot was trash!….it’s perfectly fine to leave something where it originally ended.
"Gail swallows!" -Doofy
this movie is so assss , me and my lady left before it was over 😂
I didn't know they had a new Scream movie, so how did it beat Spiderman at the box office
احلبببببب
Just finished watching the movie in the theater and I'm so glad I didn't watch the trailer.
Run don’t walk to watch this!! It’s a quality scream movie for sure
😢
it’s so cheesy and scary all at once  looks like a good movie a real scream 😂
Man this shit looks fire and they got all the originals in it still TEACHING THE NEW SCHOOL HOW TO KILL THIS MF THIS IS HOW U KEEP MOVIES FROM MY TIMES GOOD NO SWITCH UPS N REPLACING PPL THIS IS WAT IM TALKIN BOUT SORRY YALL BUT THIS IS HOW U MAKE A MOVIE
Woke nonsense
im soooooo excited!!!!!!!
Is what a great trailer I saw this movie the other night an incredible film it's not the green bathe best in my opinion but what an awesome performance by the cast A respect to West Craven
The movie sucked so much. It's rushed and has no vibe. It doesn't take anytime to put the viewer in the film. The characters are so cookie cutter its laughable. I really hope they just end the series and I'm a die hard fan. Oh and those killers were unbelievable. You've got a 5'6 90lb girl tossing people around. The hot girlfriend of the guy twin is seriously the dumbest/unneeded character of the last 30 years. And wow what an ending another fanboy bash moment. Classic 2020. Was this film made by the people who brought us that girl Ghostbusters movie?
Looks great!
It was actually a good movie . I’ll definitely watch it more than once 🥳
Why haven’t I heard of this?
Loved the movie as I watched but hella disappointing ending!!!!  4/10 for me.
The lead acress is trash.
Ananıskm çok heycanlı la
This one was better than previous! I guessed the killer as soon as they show that character :)
Look, little girl, there's a first time for everything, and if you don't learn it will be the last. You just got ghosted...
Movie was decent but not worth going to the movies to see
And the lady officer from the past screams
Can’t believe Dewey died
It looks like a good movie to me and most of my friends saying it’s lame 😭 ima still go watch it tho
I was like saw dewey in the beginning of this trailer then sidney join along , and i was shit the trailer nearly finish WHERE IS MY FUCKING GALE WEATHERS !!!! then gale showed up lol I WAS SO HYPE WITH THIS FILM , IT'S MY CHILDHOOD
Saw the movie yesterday 9/10 ghost 👻 face was ruthless wheewww, just wish Sydney was in it more but I see what they were dong in introducing the new main characters.
I watched this movie today at cinema❤️ Damn what a movie with so much suspense and thrill🤩🤩 I’ll give 9 out of 10👍🏻💕 The best thing in this movie that old characters of this film were also there❤️
This was a decent entry to the series. I took my nephew who hasn't seen the originals and he loved it and wants to watch them from the start :)
this movie fucking sucks ass
Such woke cringe
I’m not really into a horror movie having multiple killers in one movie like this but it’s a good movie if you like mystery but it really don’t become a mystery anymore bc you can just about tell who’s the killers in these movies after you watch most of them.🤷‍♂️ so overall it was an okay movie but I wouldn’t say it was the best movie
Good movie
Wait is this movie accutally scary because I don’t think it is
Почему 1080p, а не 4K?
This is why technological progres is shit
Scream 😊😊
Cant believe dewy dies
This movie is a FIREEEEEE🔥🔥🔥
When Billy Lumos was murdered his helper wasn't declared dead. What if he survived that night? What if he went to jail and served his time? What if he was released on good behavior?   Wouldn't he want revenge on those who killed his friend? Well as cool as that sounds it is not even close to the reveal in this movie. When the movie finally told me who the killer was I said " FUCK OFF FILM! "
I like how they kept original characters from the first movie waiting for the next antagonist.
What can I watch it on
Omg I watch it I screamed like 8 times in the cinemas.
Watched it yesterday 8.5/10 pretty good movie brings back a lot of memories
At the end of the movie, they wrote for wez , but who is wez?  Does anyone tell me
No way we can compare with Drew Barrymore! That’s been the very sad scariest moment of the franchise.
Wait a minute a good movie ?  Omg the world has hope after all.
Doofy strikes again!
I swear all horror movie suck in this generation
I have this movie in HD print ❤️
This was a good movie. Not sure why alot of ppl gave it bad reviews.
oh wow, another soulless hollywood reboot. what happened to original ideas?
Fucking loved it
Dewey dies in this movie
Hate it when they try to push the same timeline from the horror prequel. Theirs no where in hell where someone killing goes killing for decades.   Just re amp the story to fit the newer audience and leave the classics alone.
My first Halloween costume... I was 13 years old
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
wow
Scream will be always one of the best horror movies
Who else realized that its the first time that both black characters (and twins according to the plot), survived for the at Screams movies history?So happy!As an half African American 😍but still so sad and disappointed from Dewey's end....
I saw this in the theater yesterday and TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT
OSP on the ASX. 99% down. Research now and invest?
ZMM on the ASX. 99% down. Investment with good potential?
RAN on the ASX. 99% down. Investment with good potential?
Watched it last night (no spoilers).   I thought it was great, this is the most brutal gf has even been. If you have been keeping up to date with the scream community you may not be so surprised at the reveal but it is done in a way which is far different from the 4 previous movies.   The kills are spectacularly brutal, an absolute blood bath. As a genuine rating, I would give it a 9/10
Scream 1 is smart and scary because it sets up the rules and lets us wonder if they should follow or break them to survive, something the sequels never did.
O marido da Sidney se chama Mark, será o Mark Kincaid de pânico 3? será que o Patrick Dempsey estará em pânico 6?
Hush part 2 ? 🙄
Im gonna watch scream in cinema
Where's Chandler? 😱😰
Jenna ortega dies in the beginning? :(((
I watched it on the 13th!! I loved it definitely beat the original for me
Yes Ghostface kill those f3ck3ers 😍
I seen this movie at the cinemas yesterday and thought it was absolute trash. I wouldn’t recommend wasting your money. The acting is terrible, the story line is cheesy and it just wasn’t scary at all. I honestly rate this a solid 1.5 out of 5. 👎
Just watched it. Cried a bit in the middle
Jesus. Really? This is getting pathetic. 🤣🔪
I just could never take scream seriously, not after seeing scary movie 1 and also Jay & Silent Bob strike back.
Movie was amazing every single Ghostface scene was sick as fuck.
I love how It incorporated modern day smart home technology hacks. Unlocked doors locked doors. Creepy
Waste of money, the trailer misled me into thinking it would be worth the watch. No dark comedic value like in the originals, which was a huge let down. If watching for nostalgic reasons, like i had, just watch the original 3 at home.  (Boyfriend's words) Too much foreshadowing and 3rd wall breaking
I just seen this movie, and let me tell you it was bomb and fire ! 10 thumbs up.
I have waited 10 years and it was worth it :)
It was amazing!!!👏🙀😯 it made me jump, it made me laugh...it made me almost cry because poor...aww man I can't say why but it's kinda sad too but I loved it from beginning  to end!!! Wes would've been proud.
Just watched the movie in theaters and i really loved it! Glad to see the cast back! I rate this movie 10/10!
Shitty movie
This might be an unpopular opinion but I think that scream 5 is the best in the whole franchise and yes better then the first. I still love the first two screams but this one totally surprised me and it felt darker then the previous 4 films. I liked how it was totally aware of its self and it poked fun at the first film quite a bit.  The characters were all likable in my opinion also and I wished some of them got more screen time. My only issue is one of the reveals wasn’t that surprising but other then that. It’s the best one in the franchise and I highly recommend it.
Is that hand sanitizer?
just watched it not even scary
"You fuckin' hit me with the phone, dick!"
I watched this movie in cinemark
Bruh, the door lock would make a nice sync beat
great movie
Am I the only who wasn't impressed by the movie? I didn't like it at all together with Halloween Kills... However I enjoyed Halloween 1. I don't know maybe am a huge horror and thriller fan it's just hard to impress me anymore. I was just annoyed 🚮
0:21
50€ is Hughie Campbell from The Boys! 🤣🤣
Watch the first movie when i was in elementary school..... gonna watch this one as well👍👍👍
For Wes
2 worst killers of the franchise, and most predictable ones
Movie kind of sucked
Just watched the trailer and I’m already traumatized 🧿__🧿
Watched it tonight and had a blast definitely recommend it to anyone who might be on the fence about it
I'm confused as to why they call it scream when it's obvious that it's a continuation
Just watched , best one so far 👍
One of the worst horror movies ive ever seen
Looks stupid!! It’s over rated now !!
Boring and flat, not worth it 😪
If only Gale could have swallowed Dufus I mean Dewy back to life or at least tried a vacuum cleaner on him. Ohh by the way....... Gale swallows 😂😂😂🤣
love this for me!
Excellent yeah excellent we love screen yeah we love ghost face!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
Seeing this tonight!
Damn I thought they released this as a meme
It sadly didn't live up to the hype. Kills were as brutal as the last movies though.
Hello, do i have to watch all the scream movies before this one in order to get it ? Or is it okay if i just watch directly this one ?
UPVOTE IF YOU WANT A PART TWO!!! WE WANT ANOTHER ONE FOR 2023!!
Me and my daughter just came from the movies and seen it IT WAS AWESOME.
RIP dwight
At this point it’s just someone in a Halloween costume
Hello Sydney its an honor
dewy dies
Too bad the actresses has been smoking for the last 30 years with their nasty smokers voice
Amber is the Killer and the sister's boyfriend
This movie was absolutely incredible!
I love Neve since the 90's I would love to see her more in action movies... 💚💙💜💛💖💗
Saw it today  so good
if it’s anything like the new Michael myers i don’t want to see it
Absolute boring as f...
The movie was amazing. Must watch
Pues a mi si me gusto bastante la película
Shank shank
the killer is jackie
Just finished it loved it
Dewey dies.  Movie was not good overall  Hopefully the Wayne’s brothers make another scary movie
Nope not watching this… 😑 I watched and paid Halloween kills here on YouTube and spent $25 and it sucked so bad
What the fuck motherfuckers? Im on the first 20m and this fking acting is terrible, they actors dont even play the emotions right and everyone just fakes their act, how did this movie got to the cinema?
Dewey died
Imagine all of this shit happening just because 2 normies met on a subreddit
Terrible movie
is that the funny one?
Wow just wow so looking forward to scream 10 .....
Amaaaaazing I saw it , you can't breath even for one min
After 30 minutes I'm going to the theatre and I'm really excited!!!
So glad Neve Campbell is in this still.
Fantastic movie my favorite of them all . I have seen it twice already just want it to come out on blu ray soon.
Great movie not better than the original but better than the originals sequels most definitely
Killer is a genZ scream fan
yess i can't wait to watch this!
Just seen the film honestly to God I WANNA WATCH IT AGAIN THINKING LIKE I A PSYCHO lol.
Would you like a play a game gives me a flashback of saw movie
Billy loomis finally becomes a hero...
This movie was wack
Great movie!!! Loved every second
This movie was so good
Wow robbie and amber were the killers.  Enjoy yall
It actually looks good
nevia bother scream happend.🦷😂
Crap festival..garbage 🗑
They weren't kidding, this movie is scary! Courtney Cox's face scared the shit out of me
#GirlsGetItDone  All the guys die, well except the black guy of course, can't have that in a Hollywood movie can we? Scream's always been meta but this one is a complete mess of references and call-backs to the point of contrived farce.   Also, the killer's motive is just yet another movie with an excuse for Hollywood to continue its weirdly antagonistic relationship with "fans". If you don't want to have to please or serve the "fans" of existing franchises, then make something new that doesn't have a built-in audience you have to cater to! Won't do that though, because the story, writing and film-making would actually have to be good wouldn't it?
I waited to see stu not billy ...
Load of crap
Rip Sidney, give her a break cmon, choose another target
FUCK. Dewey is going to die. They showed a brief second of Gale (Courtney Cox) freaking out while looking at something. There's emergency vehicles in the background and Sidney is holding her back. I'm practically 100% sure it's Dewey's body.. That really sucks if true. Damn the power of deduction.
This movie sucked like a new born calf on its mother's teet. The first scene is pretty cool, then it all goes down hill like a fatman falling down a hill. A very very steep hill and a very very fat man. Love David Arquette as an actor though.
1 question where be the parents ? 🤣
it was an okay movie. the killing scenes lacks jumpscares and originality. same formula all over again. it’s pretty badass in the last minute of the movie LOVE THAT!!!!! 🔪 🔪🔪🔪
Jason is the only one that didn't have a movie yet
I JUST FINISHED WACTHING IT ITS AMAZING
zzzzzzzzzz
Not worth it
Another one?
This movie was FANTASTIC!!! They did an AMAZING job on it! Loved it!!!
i actually screamed when the killer popped out at 0:45 😂😂😂
so killer still billy?
Seen it tonight.. still think Neve is the standout and an incredible final girl hands down..
Wassup
I wonder if the writers made Gail Weathers and Dewey kiss 😚
This was the shittiest movie I have ever seen. Hahahah damn
Solid movie
Just saw it in theaters! Just wow!
Great movie. Was worth WATCHIN
Killer's use of technology to open the door 10/10
This movie was really good
Damn. Good thing I never slowed down the trailer and went frame by frame, because it reveals who Ghostface is. Why the fuck would they put that in the trailer?!?!
I'm bout to be cracking up in the theater🤣🤣🤣
Looks wack AF
not sure how to feel about it, hope it’s good, it’s just I’ve been let down by so many horror remakes and sequels lol
This means another Scary Movie.....
This looks sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad
Guys, you dropped the ball hard
We didn’t get Stu. He dead..
If they didn't look so airbrushed then it might actually be worth watching. And the gun-toting. Give me a break.
Scream is stupid
This will take away from my problems for awhile
Jut watched the movie it was freaking awesome 🔥👏
Oh hell nah not them replacing sidney for this girl we’re is  the old sidney !
Great movie well worth watching at the cinema 🍿🥤
I just saw Scream today and LOVED IT! This trailer still doesn’t do this opening murder scene any Justice.  This scene was STRESSFUL to watch lol! Ghost Face MIND F**KED this poor girl so bad and made the audience wait for before he finally popped up…. Everyone in my theater were on the edge of our seats! Probably my 2nd favorite opening scene after Drew Berrymore!
If the killer is Matt Lillard I will lose it best twist
Yeah except that "it's an honor" is not a line in the actual movie, which is a FUCKING DISGRACE
Just watched it! IT WAS STUPENDOUS! BRILLIANT! This is seriously the franchise’s best sequel to date!
This series is gonna be like Friday the 13th. They'll keep making these cuz they know you'll watch it.
Eh. It was okay?
It’s so crazy how over a year ago I anticipated this movie premiere when the media first caught a glimpse of production, and now I’m coming to the realization I’m gonna go see it in a few hours after all that waiting.
oof to Courtney Cox's face.
The scariest thing in this movie is Courtney Cox's plastic surgery.
What a joke 🙄
Just Finished it All Im Gonna Say Is  Lets Get Out There Find out who doin this N CUT SOME FUCKING THROATS
LOL I like how people say how good the movie is going to be just by looking at the trailer when half of the time they don't put the trailer in the movie smh
It came out today everyone!!!!
ITS TODAY
I JUST HAVE TO SAY I THINK THW KILLER IS STU’s BROTHER… Rene he has a brother and one of the suspects really looks like a grown version of STU’a brother
Dude that's amazing👏🙀😯😮
IM SO EXCITED
When it's on netflix? 🙃Like it no longer appears on January 14th 🙃
Black Girl survived Check! Sidney and Gale were bad ass check! I am still in a big shock from Dewey's death check! It was along with the first and second movie one of the best horror movies of the last 25 years!
lol wtf ... why does this look crap?
I love this but there was one subplot that thought was really weak when the main character was related to one of the killers from the first I thought that was dumb.
BORING!!! Imaginative screenwriters in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Almost every single movie is imitation of some good old movies, and if there are brand new movies then it's just trash with young bad actors! Please stop! 😡
Omg NEVE CAMPBELL! so excited to see her, David and Courteney back. Hell yeah!
1. Scream 1 : 9/10 2. Scream 2 : 8.5/10 3. Scream 5 : 8/10  4. Scream 4 : 7.5/10 5. Scream 3 : 5/10
I just finished watching it. Amazing movie but, unfortunately two of my favourite characters died and the ending was a little bit unclear to me
It’s been annoying waiting for this movie but FINALLY SAW IT LAST NIGHT and it was an Amazing film!
Seen it today, it was good and did Wes justice 👏
I love how in all the movies they just act like they know their in a movie
Let me tell you guys you won't Be disappointed great movie awesome  I love it 👍👍👍👍👍
Yeah I don't know. I have yet to see a horror movie franchise that is actually worth watching after the second sequel. This looks like more of the same: Jumps scares, people acting irrational and a killer that just won't die.
I’m going to see this today I’m gonna shit myself
Couldn’t watch this without thinking he’s gonna turn around and go “WAZZAAAAAP!” any second now
Terrifying but just so interesting.
This was awesome, everything a Stab! Fan could ask for
Going to see it today 😁🔥🔥
😍😍😍😍😍😍
This is new today is January
I feel like this will honor the house the Wes built , if they sacrificed the phobia/ conspiracy about smart technology working against us to the trailer what else are we in store for ^ ^ . The horror genre has been over saturated with found/leaked footage and hauntings for so long I've become bored . This has me hopeful 🙏🏼😁
The movie was so good, billy was in the film too but as a ghost sort of thing
Kinda over this movie since there are already 4 of them.
I bet its a girl killer this time
How they gone kill Jenna in the beginning
This is amazing this stuff used to freak me out but now it’s amazing
I call the guy with frosted tips, he clearly got stuck in the early 2000s
No idea what kind of moron would have their locks set up like that.
Just saw it it sucks
I was right :D
Parts in the trailers are not even shown in the movie. Just finished watching it. Wes Craven is rolling in his grave. What a bad movie this new Scream was. They hyped up legit phoney trailers to suck people in. People were going to watch it regardless. Now there is bad faith.
I just watched the movie... 😳 So disappointed
Seeing this on Sunday can't wait! 😍😍
So it was really amber and richie as the killers. Man, this trailer shown too much
Well Ghostface is definitely branching out with his methods
What an insult to wc...  Those who are expecting "Sidney Prescott, it's an honour" doesn't happen. Theyre two sound bites from separate parts of the movie" horrible horrible movie
Damn, the two female leads(Neve and Courtney) doesn't seem to age!!!
Wes Craven Masterpiece! Rest In Peace Wes Craven  Helllooo Sydney...........
"I'm watching Stab 8 on Netflix". 😆
Kevin Williamson sure knows how to write
BEST. SEQUEL. EVER.
film patek
Apologies to everybody but this character to me since Scary Movie is a walking meme saying: WHAT'S UP? meanwhile he's smoking weed hahahahahahahahahahahaha
best movie out now
jenna ortega so cute
This was like a Scream1996 manual for genZ. 🤢
the big ??? who is it lol ??? !
I already draw enough unwanted attention 2 myself like it is,,, if I found a silly mask like this to wear Halloween,,, do they sell this silly things on amazon??? !
OMG This movie made me cry at the end Because I remember 25 years ago I went to watch it with my best friends and I was young and now when I see Courtney and Nev it made me realize that time goes by so quick and we can’t stop aging but our hearts still young and full of amazing memories  FLAKA BLANCA GERALD 🧡 YOU GUYS THANK YOU
another big nasty we need 2 figure out who the killer lol
I was watching the trailer there is to me something different about this movie can't pin Point it
going to have to see this one haven't missed one yet
Such a classic
AMAZING!!!!!!! I LOVED THIS MOVIE!! Best sequel ever
Should’ve released it during the month of Halloween 🙄
i just finished defending our research i think i deserve to watch this movie:D
The movie is alright but I was expecting Stud to be the killer.
Nope. Less than 15 min in and I called the two killers. Lazy writing and directing. But, they shouldn't have even tried without Wes. The Scream franchise should have been buried with him.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgrGkU-Q2EQ  Flesh Wound Features Panel Podcast Review of Scream (2022)
thats why i woud never get those locks that open electronically through an app. when i lock them they are locked.
It was absolutely amazing!!! A must watch. My heart was racing.
i will see this soon before they take it out the show look interesting
They revealed the killers in the trailer if you look closely frame by frame. They definitely showed way too much in the trailers. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Only thing is I wish they would have surprised us with Stu at the end.That would have been satisfying and brought the movie full circle.
Just came back from watching this wow!!!!!
I liked my idea better than the story in this movie. A relative of one of the victims from part one gets revenge on the relatives of Billy and Stu.
Omg it was AWESOME
Amazing movie. My second favourite after part 1
YES
Just saw it and wasn’t impressed.
Jenna Ortega and Jasmin Savoy Brown are the MVPs of this film!
I saw it tonight and I absolutely loved it. 10/10
I literally just got back from the theater.  Awesome movie with brutal kills
These trailers just keep getting worse and worse.  They always show too much of the movie.  This trailer clearly tells us that amber is at least one of the killers.
Loved the first 2, but after seeing the new trailer, I would rather watch the original French Matrys for the 100th time.
God damn was this good
Hey, you’re gonna love this movie, try to watch the previous 4 films if you haven’t, cos it’s all linked and had tons of references of them. I think this one is better than the fourth film, pretty enjoyable, aggressive, good plot and characters! Dude, especially with one kill I wanted to leave the fucking theatre. Hope you enjoy this installment!
I wonder how it'll be without Wes Craven's magic 😥
Dewey dies too
Amber & Richie are the Killers 😊
I really hope its stu i believe he's still alive im gonna turn the fuck up in the theaters tomorrow
I've just watched the movie a few hours ago and I can tell that it is really bloody, violent, sometimes smart and a with great fan service. (please watch all the scream movies before going into this one because it would be WAY more delight).
น่าสยอง รอดูเลย
disappointing.  Not scary and not even slightly reminiscent of the original film   Wes Craven would never approve of that
YES :)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) Another Movie Marathon
I can't look at Ghostface the same after Dead by Daylight
I'm going to see it tonight. I have a feeling the killer isn't from Sydney's life, but someone doing a copy cat of her life sort of like Friday the 13th when there was a copy cat and it wasn't actually Jason
Scréme brûlée
You all gonna love this movie, i swear.  Fan of the franchise speaking right here.
I laughed so much at this trailer that idk how im gonna survive the movie  Update: i watched the movie and my stomach hurts like a bitch from laughing so much
This is better than 4 way better and more scarier if only they could have made it like this it would have been a far better hit
Can’t wait to watch it today!!!!!!
1:13 he was waiting to the guy gets exposed.
Courtney Cox aged like fine wine, if that wine had 100 shots of Botox.
1:39 is that Officer Doofy?
So ghost face killer is a hacker now?
يا سلام يا سلام يا سلام ❤️
Scary Movie hahahaha
*Soooooooooomebody* *Screeeeeeeeeeeeeeem* 👻
Gonna watch this tmrw
Watching this before the showing tonight, just makes everything all better.
So sad Dewey died and a little pissed the boyfriend was the killer, again.
Who is the killer?
So... her first instinct isn't to grab a shotgun, but to open the door to immediately get cut. You know, there is the Darwin wall.
Hate these stuff.
Vou assistir hoje 😉
Is it worthy to watch in theaters??
YEWSSSSSSS
Hello Sidney !
Can't wait for Scary Movie 6...
"Hello Sydney." "Hello Peter" "Hello there." "Hello Dr. Freeman." "Hello? Hello, Hello?"
“It’s a scream baby!..be right back.”  Stu
Whenever a horror movie gets released in January, it usually means it's going to suck. Just something to keep in mind.
Going to see it Friday I’m hella excited
Though billed as a relaunch of the film series,[4][5] the film is a direct sequel to Scream 4 (2011), and the first in the series not to be directed by Wes Craven, who died in 2015
I don't give a sh#@t about this franchise but Yall didn't tell me Kiara from the lion king 2 was in it?
10/10 would get stabbed again
The worst Stabber in history! :D
What is this a remake a reboot ?
Please tell me this isn’t real
Can't wait to see the movie already
Favorite movie ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
WHY did they have to give it the exact same name?? Don't you know how that screws up Google searches?
The text is coming from inside the house. #MillennialScream
Life is to precious to waste 2 hours of it on this shit
Same old shit in a new wrapper, I would rather watch Scary Movie one more time and pay for it cuz it's genuinely funny.
There are 2 killers
.
My prediction is that Judy & her Son are the killers and that they either get a way with it or almost do or something like that. Can’t wait to see this movie!!!
I'm sorry but I can't take this movie seriously after I watch scary movie
I'll be calling ghost face at 12am or 1am or 3am when it comes out
You have a cell phone in your hand🤦🏻‍♂️Dial 911.
This movie is scary and funny at the same time! And at the same time it tells you no one is safe at all! I will rank this as my third fave in the series ❤️ Scream 2, 1,5,4,3!!! The motive is legit crazy and thats when you realise psychos do exist 😅 Hopefully there will be future Scream movies ❤️❤️❤️
Im ready for the next Scream. Never get bored.
Looks good plot. Glad Dewey and whole cast back.
Richie and Amber are the killers they are huge stab fans
I was re-watching the series when I read there will be a fifth one.
The original cast is looking 👍🏾
Just seen it tonight, did not disappoint, highly recommend 🙌
As a Ghostface main in DBD, I approve of this trailer
Ngl this shii looks 🔥
This comes up as an ad. The doors locking and unlocking is hilarious, I thought it was like a troll ad! 😂  No one is gonna take this movie seriously. The matrix flopped, we can’t take anything serious anymore 😆
Wazzuppppp
She plays stuck in the middle Jenna Ortega
Golden Goast Face with a flame 🔥 Trower this time. Scream 5
Man I can't wait to see it on Friday!
This looks bad
I hope this release here in Thailand I need to see this in the theater! I love the SCREAM movies
Ahuevo es lo que esperaba
“The killer is on the poster”
Hopefully its the riverdale kids dad again
This looks terrible. STOP PAYING STUDIOS TO MAKE THIS REGURGITATED SHIT
Did anyone else notice that Dewey is dressed just like Arthur Morgan From Red dead 2?
Did Jenna be in this movie just to die?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
“If you declare with your mouth “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9). Now is the time to accept Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior. Obey His commands and repent of your sins because Jesus is coming back soon. Tomorrow isn’t promised.
Wazzzzz uppppp
Woow 25 years since the first Scream came out ..way to go making us all feel old 🤣
wazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzuuppppppppppppp
is this related to scary movie sidney ?
ill be @ the theatres this weekend!!! woohooooo this got some juice in it still
It's happening... Three attacks so far, do you have a gun? I'm Sidney Prescott of course I have a gun 👏👏
Hello Sidney its an honour what a line im literally dying to see this movie now yes i said it.
What's next? Friday the 13th. (2023)? Or Nightmare on Elm Street (2024)?
*It's just not the same without Wes Craven. He was like the Supreme Master of Horror Movies.*
So excited for this! Wish they had brought back Parker Posey's character.
That woman Is stupid for installing door that unlock with a fucking phone what if it gets hacked
And cue the scream Halloween costumes for 2022 🥴
When this come on
Looks damn good and even better they brought the old actors in for it. Makes it the best.
do I have to watch the previous parts to understand the strory of this movie?
Well, personally if Skeet isn't in it I don't care! I mean Jason always returns! Why can't Skeet Ulrich!? 🖤
Y’all I need your advice. Do you think this movie will be worth it in 4DX? Thanks
Why why why isn't this film called Scream 5?
It's gotta be Sydney now right? Like Sydney is the killer?  😂 Like she just finally lost her shir
The better not kill off Sidney in this film
I wonder if Sidney will FINALLY die?! I think these movies lost their scare factor once phones evolved. It takes away the fear.
Jeez, they have to revive any piece of crap they can think of these days.
I have a feeling this time the killer is Dewey.
Imagine the worst preview you ever heard, that's guys' voice .. This movie would sound like this in reality if it was a preview or trailer !..   "THIS JANUARY, YOU WILL DISCOVER A WHOLE NEW LEVEL OF GenX'ers, WRITERS AND ACTORS THAT COULDNT MAINTAIN A CAREER OR NEW IDEAS TO EARN A LIVING IN THE 2000s AND BEYOND.... HOPING ... GEN*Z* WAS TOO DUMB TO NOT SEE THE PLASTIC SURGERY AND LYPO OF LATE 90's CHARACTERS, THAT... , LETS BE HONEST ... AINT DONE MUCH SINCE AND HAVE *GOTTA BE* RUNNING OUTTA CASH BY NOW ..  ... Seriously this Movie aint at all that good whatsoever, but its a good laugh at when GenX, self-proclaimed "Elites"  desperately try to cling on of some kind of ...... "Coolness" ...    FARQOF!!!
cannot wait!
"It's Happening again......" *Hangs phone up* Roll credits
I was never a fan of Horror Movies, always found them dumb and predictable. I remember when Scream was coming out I went "Oh! Never Campbell from party of 5 is in a movie, let's go check it out, I like her". Saw every one. Fell in love with this series.  Only horror franchise I can say I've seen every installment.
It would be cool if Alexa was the killer... Or even better yet... If the killer was a actual ghost
I'm soooo going
I just don't think this can do anything for me
Everybody scream... 😅
OH MY GOD
Why is it titled the same as the Original? And how many times they gonna regurgitate this crap? And how come theres never any titties in these movies???  All the actors are over age
Let’s Go!!!!!!
1:45  🥶 David Arquette
3 days! 🤪
so far the critics loves it but im curious to know what the general public thinks of it.
talking about milking a franchise to death
Wtf imma be mad if the kill Jenna Ortega at the beginning of the movie.
Whaaasaaaaaaap
Im willing to bet they're are two and one of them is a girl
she's literally right next to the door. Drop your stupid tablet and hold the lock from moving. movie looks so stupid
I didn't like how Sidney intreduced herself to the audience (I thought it was very cheesy).  But I really liked the "Hello Sidney. It's an honor".
The killer is Stu
JESUS CHRIST TIS SCREAM
ALEXA WTF LOCK THE FUCKING DOOORS!!!!
I am just getting to excited for this now. It's like waiting for Xmas x9999. It's too much!! 😱😱😱
yooo
Don’t answer the phone.   Don’t open the door.  Don’t try to escape!
Another fun romp with Ghostface 👻🗡
Spoiler alert: The killer is Mr Prescott...Sydney's dad 🤷‍♂️
Filme ou série????
Ok if you look at "the killer is on here" poster then look at the original scream poster. The meeks kids are in the same position where Stu and Billy are.
"There are rules to surviving.  First, everyone get their own knife, I mean WTF you can order it on Amazon prime delivery."
As a big Scream fan I'm Excited for this. It's gonna be really good
Omg  !Msia on 20 Jan.. cant wait to watching .. i miss neve ..
Damn my Jena
I don't know why but this feels like Escape Room
Scream 2022 Soundtrack here. https://youtu.be/hny-jF7d5Gw
Hey I don’t trust the blonde haired kid
Screw an all female Avengers movie. I need a team up movie with Sidney Presscot , Nancy Thompson and Lorie Strode.
Seen whole movie in 5 mins
Herina
What is it friends
Vacuum lights dad mum put dinner in Sydney
Who wants to bet they bring back Stu
Do i need to watch the 4 scream movie before watching this ?
Seems like they’re trying to do a slight reboot/passing of the torch
One of my fav thriller as a kid. I'm excited for it!!!!
This looks like a much darker Scream film! I can’t wait to see it in theaters!
I was able to see an early screening and Dewey and Gale ended up getting divorced.  So sad to see Sid get killed but at least her death wasn't in vain.
I stopped after scream 2. Ill give it a chance tho. Do I need to watch the others before this one?
Meh.
I love scream 1, it so special
*Ghostface, the clumsiest killer on the planet. The guys always falling, tripping & swinging wildly. I love him.*
L Tage Missed Half Of Your Shots Fr Though. Practicing With Infinity Blade When Its Vaulted. STINGERS ARE VALID!!!
does the actor for sydney just like not age
Just finished watching this it was amazing!
First mistake was answering that door... someone was knocking at my door...it was creepy too..I walked to the door and felt a type of weird vibe...and I backed up quietly from the door...it was a weekend...that Monday I opened my door and some ornaments I had on my door had been removed...I'm not opening my door for no one...and when you're spooked in the first place...all everything gets silenced...the phone the TV...like you not at home!
Crazy but I always wanted them to bring back Stu and Billy somehow! Well maybe not billy but Stu could of been plausible he survived! Minor electrical shock 😂 I was obsessed with the first 3 as a kid..
Im seeing this with my friend and dad this Friday. Can't wait 😩😭🤚
This looks like an action movie. Lol everything now has to be “dark” and “epic.” It’s Hollywood’s crutch now. Looks awful.
i hate halloween movies sooo much. i hope this one is as good as scream 4 or better! halloween is garbage!!!!
https://youtu.be/XoIQ8CrP-Xw 👀
Ya quiero verla 😞
patiently waiting for the scary movie version of this
These movies are based on a real life murder where two kids waited in this girls basement and stabbed her to death after messing with her psychologically, turning off lights, etc. The guy who stabbed her was a guy she rejected. They were in highschool. The other kid claimed he didn't think they'd actually go through with it. It's awful
Hopefully the January dumping month curse doesn’t apply here.  The guys behind Ready or Not-Radio Silence-making this sounds brilliant. Hopefully they can pull the magic that Wes Craven can’t bring us anymore.
Dewey looks like he had enough of this shit. lol
Бля, ну сколько можно)
How can they just name it the same as the first one?
the best movie ever for 25 years
Stop over advertising, You’re in line with rainbow six extraction at this point
Who do y’all think is the killer?
Can't wait to see this, I dobt watch alot of horror movies but the scream movies are my absolute favorite thriller to watch not just on halloween but whenever I feel like having a thriller night, this and Halloween. So stoked
Guys what would y’all think if now for like at least 2 movies they don’t reveal who the killer is like they don’t catch them or kill them they escape and come back next movie (still same killer/person) I would love that
Please we need comedy.
Your ass is grass Scary Movie, 2000
Why did they call it "Scream'" and not "Scream 5"???
First this and now a new insidious movie trailer too, looks like the horror genre is trying to make its come back finally after that disaster of all those garbage superhero movies
"what's your favorite scary movie" not this one lmao
Just once i would like a situation like this to turn into the "victims" loved ones screaming over the phone to the killer that "if you are in the house.... get out of there! That was part of the Deal! Threats INSIDE the house are fair game, AND THAT MEANS I CANT STOP THEM ANYMORE!!!!!" Right before the lights die completely and an insane cackle that is a mix between Joker and Alucard can be heard echoing through the house.........
The scream movies are classics!!!!! The 90s were epic!!! So nostalgic 🙌🏼
Yeeeeess! This was my favorite horror movie growing up as a child. Glad to see the cast back together again!!
Scream 2022 will be great to see in theaters on January 14th.  The 1996 scream is a classic
Ooh can’t wait
Looks trash. Really would have been a good time to re imagine it and actually make it good
What's scary about him is that he's not immortal he's just like us.
Why Jenna Ortega has to be killed in the beginning they should’ve made her a survivor
I can't wait!!!!!!
You know Hollywood is definitely out of ideas when they use same name of the first installment for a sequel.
Come on, production, bring back 'Stu'  He could have survived and it would be great for Matthew Lillard to not be shown as part of the cast but still show up at the end.
My childhood horror movies coming back real strong. Now just Chucky, Jason, Jeepers Creepers and THOMAS HEWITT!!
This looks like the best Scream so far it looks like it actually gonna be scary
I am diying to see it! hahaha lol, get the pun? ya
Is Stu back?
When is new Zealand getting it
Not long now!! I can't wait! Scream is one of my favorite franchises.
I like to see the originals. They just better not die.
Now where's Kirby? lol
1 more wk!!
Hi

lousy movie. absolutely can't beleive that the paramount pictures team would dare to step on scream 1 through 4's feet. i will not sit here and take this. a real man deserves a real horror movie 🤢🤡
Scream was such a good movie when I was younger. I need to see Scream 4, I dont remember if I've seen it. I definitely want to see this one. And I just love hearing my names in things LOL
I love Scream!!!
If they kill Dewey I'll be pissed. I watched the first one when I was like 9 and he's always been my favorite 💖
Who doesn't love Ghost Face? 🤩🤩🤩
How many times are they going to go after Sidney Prescott? 😆😅🤣
I’m letting y’all know I’m boycotting the franchise if Kirby doesn’t make a surprise reappearance  I KNOW SHE LIVED THROUGH THE LAST ONE DAMN IT
My fav childhood movie is back. Looking forward for sidney prescott and the gang. So excited!
This better be good or i’ll be so sad :/
Im a scream lover and I absolutely cannot wait till it comes out on 14th 🤪🤪!!
Billy Loomis had a son that nobody knew about.  🗡️
One more week 🙌 😫
https://youtu.be/CtuZpjb4-fU
The old cast yeeeeey
Can't wait!!!
Maybe it’s because I saw Scream 4 in theaters when I was in high school - but the fact that the time between the release of Scream 4 and 5 is the same as the time between the Scream 3 and 4 is insane to me.
Dead meat
Ohh, how we want to 😱 Scream!!
The teens, do not look like teens
wazaaa
Bro where is the comedy
I know who killer IS SAMANTHA she wasn’t in other scream movies, how does she know her?
It's probably Billy Loomis, he actually survived in the original film.
Wowwww..scream back again ✌✌
It looks good
Randy is the killer...😂
EXCITED!!!!!! 😱😱😱
more dumb it's impossible: you take some stupids teens and you kill them one by one all along those 2 hours. end of story. the script? well, no need, it's just for teens, stupid or not they will run for this crap
Honestly, the original is the only scary movie that’s scared me. It’s a different kind of scary movie.
Well that looks shit
Can’t wait to see the movie
Is this the one where they go back in time...  For real though I bet it's a cult
The mask is so great man.
I hope just like Wes craven’s other screams this one isn’t stand alone and actually continues previous events
I love it when trailers spoil like half of the deaths
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&t=1s
Looks awful
Yaaaaayyyyyyy
One pew pew can fix knife problems.
: /
ICONIC Villian Scream
So excited about this. One thing about the trailer though is it feels like the original cast except for Gail are going to die, which will open up a whole new franchise for the younger generation. Hopefully, I'm wrong but this being the first Scream Movie without Wes Craven I'm feeling they might do something dark and drastic with Sydney and Dewey. Either way Wednesday can't come quick enough.
Will definitely be seeing this looks awesome. Only thing is who has a landline anymore. 😉
In my opinion There will be two killers and the killers are:    Sam Carpenter and Richie Kirsch or Liv McKenzie and Wes Hicks can be Sam Carpenter and Wes Hicks or Liv McKenzie and Richie Kirsch too
I'm watchin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s an honour that, finally, as a movie fan, and a young adult now, I will be able to watch a Scream movie in the theatre for the first time. I’m so looking forward. ❤️❤️❤️
i'm going to take a wild shot in the dark and say the killer in the new scream movie is a girl.
Super excited for this 🙌
Tara is fine asf
why is the movie so overrated,,,just a man with a knife killing people
LMFAO !!! What is it with all these fuckin Remakes?? Same name, just new dumb shit !!! SMH 🤦‍♂️
This trailer looks very good.
I AM WAITING!!!! Can’t January 14th get here ANY FASTER?!?! 😆
i cant wait to watch it
i hope this will have comedic flare like the original.   otherwise it will be just be corny without self-awareness.   i call for a shi tty remake
I thought they were all in HS. It looks like to me they are in GERITOL SCHOOL. What the?
The Scream franchise is one of those rare ones that I could watch every single day and never get bored. Neve Campbell is phenomenal
"I want to play a game" tell him he got the wrong franchise started the trailer on a bad note no offense lol.
They need to recreate that Jada Pinkett death scene. That had to be the most dramatic death of the entire series.
when is it coming out?
My childhood's friend
YES
I really hope this isn't super serious love the cheesy scream stuff
It doesn’t look as fun as the original.
Uhh another one. Looks exactly like the fourth
looks like shit
God, Hollywood is good at abusing nostalgia/hype.
Im so happy Courtney cox is still in this one
when will it be released?
That plastic face is terrifying... ghost face killer is also scary
This looks so bad tbh 😂
Why on earth would they  not have released this at halloween, or wait until next halloween?
January horror movie why Scream why
The creators of this movie should be jailed for animal cruelty. Stop flogging a dead horse and let it go....
Blink and you miss it, either recreated shot of the scene in the original when Billy raised his knife, or flashback.
IM SO PUMPED
im gonna call it right now... me watching the trailer: wow thats look great!!  me in the future after watching the movie: Look How They Massacred My Boy!
Someone was bored.
Dewey is the killer
My "bet", one of the killers is the girl with the pink hair
Only seen the trailer and I'm calling it, Jack Quaid is one of the Killers. (Yes I'm assuming more than 1)
Long live Wes Craven and I'm happy the cast is back for a new generation. Like Sidney said "Don't fuck with the original".
Anybody noticed at 1:33 the jacket the dude is wearing is the same jacket steve had in scream 1?
I remember when scream 4 came out and thinking how crazy that was because it had been 11yrs since scream 3 came out. Now another 11yrs has passed since scream 4 came out. God damn, time be flying. But I'm definitely going to watch this.
What would u do if u were caught up in the same situation? I genuinely want to know! Whats the first thing u would do?
Just please don’t kill the originals !!!😭😭😂
Sidneyyyyyyyyy, Dewyyyyyyy.  😍😍😍😍
It's super cool that there are hints from the other movies. Firstly the house from the first one, Randy's rules to surviving, and a slight celeb cameo for the beginning.
I never watched any of the movies and just searched up "Scream movie" so damn
Just learned this was based after real events
Looks good 😊
I'm waiting for the movie And finally this movie is out this month!!!
please be goood
This seems a blatant attempt to try and squeeze more money out of a franchise that had its time years ago. Did anyone really want a remake of scream? Why can't they come up with something new, I mean the original was nothing that special anyway. I always preferred the scary movie version 😁
I dont even care about the fact shes got a landline in 2022. Im all in for seeing this!
wasssssaaaaaaaaaa
all i know if this girl needs to stay at my house and knocks on my door i am not opening the door
Again, get your ass upstairs and barricade the damn door.  Call 911.  Survive.
Anybody else feel like the killer WONT be revealed?
If the killer isn't the Fonz I'm going home unhappy.
Le hice una parodia, por si les interesa, gracias
Do they have to show case how much tech has progressed from the original Scream? only to outdated it’s self in 5 years? people 5 years from now “ha that’s cute remember when we had those old devises to control the house? I can control everything in my house the my brain implant hahahah”
Modern trailers are sooo generic
So does sidney or dewey have any kids in this movie
I wouldn’t be surprised if Sydney turned out to be Ghost Face after being consumed by the trauma of it all. She’s coming after everyone who was able to move on like nothing ever happened, because for her, it still feels like yesterday!
John Wick show up and Ghostface ran all the way to hell
Ahahaha, боже, я вырос на ужасах! Этот фильм для меня точно станет легендой(даже если он провалится)
Summary of the movie : New rank 20 survivors are getting carried by rank 1 sidney, gale, dewey(dwight) against ghostie.
i love scream
I love scream because no matter what it always remains the same with that great plot twist at the end on who’s the killer every scream movie was excellent this is probably my favorite horror movie ever no lie scream is just built different 🔥  But other horror films where the first two are good and the next 6 are garbage I get tired of like fredddy and Jason movies not all of them are good
Is this old? seen this trailer before
hes finally back with his classicest outfit
9 MORE DAYS
Wes and Judy Hicks will be the killers 😱
Oh shitt why did Jenna open the door 🤣🤣
Very good
Oh jesus not again.  I did not like the look on Gales face. Please do not kill Dewey. My question is, why everybody hate Sydney? She ain't ever did nothing wrong and she's been harassed by 8 different people. She can't get no break can she? Started at 18, now she like 50. She gonna be 80 still fighting these mofos. There's always 2 killers and one is always related to her or attached to her in some way. Dewey: do you have a gun. Syd: I'm Sydney Prescott yes I have a gun. At this point I hope you have a whole ass arsenal.
Ghostface mains rejoice
Creative kills and twists are what this series DESPERATELY needs. Watched every single scream movie and tv show in this franchise, and it definitely needs just a bit of tightening up.
Nothing new terrible looks like a netflix movie
Who is the Ghostface
Who is the killer in this movie
Iconic
I can not wait
I'm sitting here watching this, and 1 thought comes into my head. Why? No thanks.
dewyyyyy oh no not dewyyyy!! he was bent over in the car and he was right behind him 😳😳 i can't wait for this i loveeee scary movies and nothing but
Looks like Joe changed his mind about letting Elle go…
One of my favorites
I’m so fuckin hype!!!!!
Fuck yeah dude nice to see the same actors 💪💪💪
✨
Scream 3 was practically a comedy. I like how the original characters are back in this one.
Watching again.....i'm preparing myself for next wednesday (January 12) in France. OMG 😛 🔪🔥
kinda angry drew isn’t sydney
We sure this isn’t Halloween 2018 ?
O.  M. G.
Well SHIT, this actually looks good
Omg!  Can’t wait!
They still make the same old movies that I like and watched when I was younger
If this is how 2022 is gonna start then kiss away any hopes that Hollywood might actually come up with original content anytime soon
I'm so hyped for this
Gonna ruin another classic.
Lemme guess Gale,Dewey and Sidney are gonna be the  last survivors right
Courtney Cox finally showing her age. Oof.
I DON'T KNOW, BUT FOR SOME STRANGE REASON I LOVE THAT MASK, IT MAKES THE MOVIE 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Do you need to see all the other scream movies before seeing this one?
10 days!!!!
how to stop the killer send him to an nra house.
Love it ..the best
I’m here for it! I hope it’s not cheesy….
I always liked to imagine that Woodsboro is full of murderers and any time someone wants to kill someone they put the Ghostface mask on. It's like an unspoken thing.
Omg I cannot believe it!!!!! My favorite movie all the time!!!!
No puedo esperar 😆
Me growing up and knowing this movie series really well, no doubt I'm going to catch this in theaters on January 14th. Can't wait...
This one has a darker vibe than the others. 🙌🏾
So exciteeed
Almost 2 wks to go!!
What I found most scary about this is the technology used today. She could locked all her doors using her phone which ultimately was hacked which makes it so much more scarier.
I can't wait
Come on please 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this shit is funny
I love the trailer; It makes me want to watch the movie. Great Job paramount. Check out my reaction.
I really hope this is Stu Macher
This movie looks terrible ppl are crazy if they like this
Kevin Spacey is the kiler😉
I have watched all scream movies besides #4. I just couldn't get off into it but mane I got too see this! The "door unlocked/locked" scene is very terrifying.  Imagine someone else having your passcode to the most safest place to be. "Home".
There will be only 1 killer in this movie I bet..
10 more days. I am super hyped for this.
Welcome to the comments, don’t worry it’s safe here! :D
damn, they just shut down movie theatres here cause of rising cases. Ghostface is gonna have to wait. gonna have to avoid spoilers.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Prolly gonna be another shit film produced by Hollywood just to sell us wolf tickets… can’t they come up with anything new sheesh
Looking forward to seeing this.
Wow, i watched this just to see Courtney Cox
Got worried they brought another voice actor than roger l jackson to voice ghostface for a minute there…..
Stuck In The Middle Scene That Was Banned  *Exclusive Footage*
Why?
Old actors & new actors
Dude in the beginning ghost face should’ve said “what’s your favorite scary movie like the first one”
I love you Jenna 😘
On one hand the metallic mask and flame thrower seems awesome(if you gotta reboot a franchise might aswell up your game) But I'm not looking forward to seeing all the same problems as the first 4.
I was 11 when the first film came out, 26 years later I’m still super excited to see a new film. Scream is my generations’ Halloween. I really hope to see Neve and the gang still messing up ghostface in a few decades like Jamie Lee with Michael Myers.
This looks great. Can’t wait to see it. Is it me or do I Hope Dewey dies in this one. I can’t stand him.
waaaazuuuup
This is in my theatre January 7th
Killer probably doofy
The return of Ghostface!
“Hello sydney” the most iconic thing i have ever heard
Im not scared
the biggest mistake of  EVERY HORROR CHARACTER is they don't have SOLID ARMOR PIERCING BULLETS  of at least .50 caliber or more  1 DESERT EAGLE with a 25 round CLIP / MAGAZINE with  solid armor piercing bullets would stop any human and if there's a possibility of 2 BULLET PROOF VESTS then get  TITANIUM DIAMOND CUT ( shaped ) ARMOR PIERCING BULLETS  in the USMC we had TANK BUSTER BULLETS that could penetrate 6 inches of armor plating
Yoooo how many times are they gonna keep making scream  Its 2022 and they still remaking old movies 🤦‍♂️
Nice trailer
Neve is hotter than ever
So fucking good
Love horror films 😀🍸🍹
Halloween?
So it’s a girl… since they call it a him
Ya no da miedo da risa 🤣
Omg!!!!!!! Can’t wait !!!!!
5cream
Hellllll nooooo 🙆🏿
Guarentee its dewey or gale
Who's the last killer of scream??😅
I can hear the scream soundtrack is coming to us finally!! Waited for so long ! So excited 🖤🖤🖤💥
I can’t take scream seriously because of scary movie 🤣🤣🤣
Every dreary cliche in the tedious book. Dull flat pointless violent trousers. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!
Yoooooooooooooo OG coming BaCk
Can’t wait
More material for scary movie 6
Scream ❤❤
Excited even tho it isn't Wes.  Why is it called Scream? shouldn't there be a 5 or something after that?
Ig we can go see this movie for the new year🥰
Anyone seen that 'The killer is on this poster' promo for Scream? And every character is in the poster? Talk about a red herring. Ghostface is also on that poster, and I'm starting to think Stu might really come back for one last scare.
I wonder who the killer will be? My guess is either Jack Quaid or Dylan Minnette, or both working together
Anyone got a clue, who's Sydney's husband?
is it duey now hahaha
Is it a 15? Like scream 4
This looks so good
Wish they would spoil more of it 😒
Finally a scream movie I’ll be scared to watch the other ones felt cheesy this is dark and horrifying like the new hallaween I think after scary movie ghost face got the scary part out of him but I think this is gonna bring it back
This is why you don’t get smart locks
💀💀
I’m glad this looks like it’s more of a serious horror movie instead of the stupid comedy.
callling it now the killer is Billy Loomis little brother, who went away to live with the mother when she left the dad and now hes getting revenge for the death of his brother and mother!
I’m going to watch this when it comes out for sure
They just need micheal Myers to fix this
🤣🤣🤣
Wow another franchise that ended literally a decade ago pedowood I mean hollywood is defiling cause they ran out of ideas. Let me guess it was made “fitting modern standards” with Ghostface is a incompetent ass and Cindy is a strong independent wahman who need no man who trains this new girl to be a strong independent wahman too to terrorize Ghostface in return right?  F*ck off hollywood.
The thing I didn't like in this movie is that there is use of modern technology. I Don't like the modern technology in horror movies.
I am cautiously optimistic. Though one thing that kinda irks me is the recent trend of new installments of beloved franchises just using the title of the original film with no subtitle.
Can’t wait!
Hope that Tara's attack don't be the opening scene. It looks very similar to Scream 4 opening.
The door scene 😂😂
Spoiler alert.  Neve Campbell is the killer
Dylan is my killer guess..
Oh. Part 5. This is the one with time travel which is by far the worst!
In that first clip did she go and open the door? Lol
Omgosh I love this! I'm a scream fan. I can't wait to see this. Thank you for making another one..
should have stopped after the first one. the plots just get dumber and dumber. statistically speaking, encountering this many serial killers in your lifetime is impossible.
Lost interest 20 seconds in when the dumb bit open the door! Like.. someone has your friends phone, calling and unlocking your doors.. grab something! They made her too dumb.. it’s gonna be 2022 in 10 minutes.. we seen and been through this. Only pleasing scene was him smashing homies ankles.
so place your bets how is dewy almost going to die this time
Omg..its classlc.i wanna see that
Makes me want to marathon the whole series.
this terrified me
"White mask, knife, fleeing victim? I've seen this one before."
"wait Wait WAIT!"
14 days away….. I’m shaking. I can’t wait to SCREAM
"I'm sydney prescott of course I have a gun"  - "I'm american, of course I have a gun"
Just noticed that the ghostface mask at the end looks like a Roman Numeral 5.
Ohhhhh shit this looks good
Nostalgia anyone?
en 2 semanas!!! :D
The killer is someone from the first and 3rd scream movies
Damn it feels like the trailer showed the whole movie
This Scream could be the best one! Looks brilliant. Neve is looking hotter, Courtney is looking nice and Arquette looks like he's still got his police duties mojo. Should be a good one.
Sidney, Gale and Dewey having a 5th time dealing with this
I hope scream wins this time 😎 🔪🔪🔪
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
I'm just saying if shaggy ain't the killer than I'm leaving
Looool so cheap and predictable (as 99% of horror movies)
Cinema is dead, this looks terrible. Remakes everywhere you look, no originality anymore.
Is this a remake because it same scream
It's been an honor to serve us another Scream franchise :')
That line "the attacks were all on ppl related to the original killers" really struck me. So are we saying Tara is related to Billy or stu? And who else was attacked, how are they related to Billy or stu?
I saw an ad w/o audio and thought she kept locking and unlocking it herself, and thought they were making it funny again.
where is Emma Roberts tho???
Well ya know Dewey is gonna die considering Gale’s lookin like she’s tryin to run into his crime scene with the horrid look on her face…thanks Hollywood🙄👍🏼
I love this move
Heck I think there all funny 😂🤣😂, and they make fun of if u watch closer u could see that, so why is these crazy people want too fight over something so stupid really grow up several of u that I seen comments from want to act so ignorant so grow up it's just a dang 🍿 movie's and they all are funny to me anyways and they do make fun of the other so why don't you act your age and not your shoes size, and yeah my kids act older than u y'all do
Melissa Barrera 🇲🇽🇲🇽
do not cancel the sonic movie 2 i like  this movie
I don't get it...if this isn't a reboot why not call it Scream 5 instead of just Scream? 🤔
You got my favourite richie rich character Jenna Ortega
Looks really good but I don't see anyone topping the brutality of the kills in " Halloween kills "
I thought they were poking a jab at the fact halloween 2018 sequel is just "Halloween"
Cant wait 😎
Unpopular opinion....the first SCREAM should have been the only one ever made. Same goes for A Nightmare on Elm Street. Hollywood fucked Wes Craven's vision, both of these movies would be infinitely more terrifying without their sequels.
Definitely going to see this :)
Who has a land line in 2022
There’s gotta be multiple killers.
The stu being the killer idea is a mixed bag for me.  I've been commenting on lots of videos about this.  But part of the appeal of Scream is that it is based in the real world and is conceivably possible, and that anyone can be ghostface.  As the movie series is famous for, there are rules.  And two of them follow in the continuity of the films  1) The Killer(s) in each movie die in the film that they are  in. 2) No Killer has ever come back and resurfaced later in the series, other than being mentioned by surviving characters.  Stu breaks both of these rules.  And it's okay to break the rules, but there needs to be very logical explanations for these things since once again, these movies are supposed to be grounded in realism.  This isn't like the other franchises that have loopholes and oftentimes silly explanations and supernatural shit going on.  These are all human beings that don't have super powers or reincarnation techniques at their disposal.  To me Stu is dead.  And his character holds a special place in the pantheon.  I love Stu, we all do.  But explaining how he got away and survived in the first film is too much, or that he's operating from Prison, it feels way too convenient.  I think the killer(s) will have a connection to the past, we just don't know exactly what that is yet.  I want to be surprised by it.
omg asif dylan minnette is in this i can't fucking wait
I love scream
Huh front door locks controlled by your phone over wifi  i wonder why no ones came up with that before
Still miss Randy. But I'm so waiting for this
ngl this looks miles better than Scream 4
Yess Untill Now I love this movie so much ❤️❤️
I think the killer is much stronger on this one!
I hope this movie is good considering it already has stupid scenes were he emptys his gun instead of shooting ghostface its such a facepalm moment to  whoever directed that scene
damn im impressed of jenna shes really become such an amazing actress
this feels like it is not the beginning of the movie or is it just me?
Dude Dylan Minnette  is the killer so baad i can feel it
Can't wait to see it on theaters I know her  brother I went to school with him at La Quinta High school
Killer is Wes
Plot twist, all the movies after scream 1 have been cidney killing everyone. She had a physcotic break and became the killer herself.
Scream "The Final Scream"
this doesnt work for me. for people who grew up watching these movies in their teens and 20s, doing a hard reset is a tough sell. I might watch it down the line out of curiosity but certainly not expecting it to measure up. I'm really not seeing how the over the hill cast will mesh with the cliche young characters presented here. one can only hope theres a clever reason for these choices
I hadn't heard about this this is awesome
Non voglio vedere scream e un sasino
I would love it if they thought Billy died. But he was alive this whole time pulling all of the strings. ❤️❤️❤️
Can y'all please stop rehashing old properties to get a soulless cash grab on nostalgia? And can we stop falling for all these soulless cash grabs? Please? None of these remakes/reboots in the past 20 years were ever good Name ONE good reboot/rehash
Awesome trailer
Ansiosooooo! ❤️
Okay y’all so hear me out when I say this. Kirby was never confirmed to be dead or alive at the end of Scream 4. Jill would have been brain dead so she’s out of the question as the killer. So I’m thinking Kirby is alive and she’s the killer. It’s the only thing that makes logical sense. Unless Sydney’s mother or father has a brother or sister Sydney knows nothing about. which is highly a possibility and would make sense as to why the focus isn’t solely on her anymore.
R.I.P Wes Craven
Wow, directors are really having to scrape the bottom of the barrel looking for movies to race swap these days.

Respect tradition and have a famous actress ended at the beginning. 😁
After i watched the parody version with the wayans brothers i cant take this film seriously😭
I’m not buying Jenna Ortega being the opening death, feels like this trailer is tricking us
I bet you the killer is Dennis Quaid’s kid
I'm gonna see this in Cinema... One times, Two times, Three times, ...
This and the Texas chainsaw massacre in the same month  I am happy
Omg I'm so excited!

Omgosh I have that exact same phone lmao
It's funny how its not scary
not intimidating at all
Lol the advantages of automated home lock system
They just keep remaking old movies for money I see that now they got another matrix coming out
Bro, when I saw this trailer on tv I thought it was an ad for a electronic lock
rest in peace Paramount studio 1912-2022
I saw the ad for this and thought it was for a ring commercial
Wait did Dewey get killed?
Shit looks awesome
They missed an opportunity to make Ghostface say WAZUUUUUP when Sidney turned around
YESSSSS!!!!!!
BRING IT!!!!!N    I cant wait to see this one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
It seems like this movie is going more in a straight horror direction as opposed to the self-aware horror parodies that the previous Scream films by Wes Craven were.
Weird thought but what if this killer is maureen-
what if there's a scene with Matthew Lillard, I really fuckin wish.
*YO I am SO AT THE MOVIE THEATER WHEN THIS COMES OUT, BUT It's The Fact That I Press Play To Watch The Trailer & They Literally Playing with The Damn Door Locks Had Me LMFAOoo* 😈🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️😭😭😭😭🤣😂
This has to be my best acting ever.
Billy is back
Jigsaw reference??🤔🧐🧐
as a member of gen z, i don't claim these kids.
I can't wait its coming out on my birthday  Also sents this is a sequel to the first movie that means we can confirm that randy is not dead even if he's not in this movie
I’m scared for this movie. The older movie all talked about movies and this should probably be about the rise in Hollywood returning to old favorites. That doesn’t seem to be the case. This looks like a straight up sequel (just titled Scream and not Scream 5) that begins with Jenna Ortega doing the same as Drew Barrymore in the original. I feel like it’s going to be the worst but I hope it’s not bad
I can't wait to see this!
Can't wait to see it,love the series since my childhood
It's you? Scary movie? 🥺
NO STOP WAIT WAIT!
Thought this was just another abysmal sequel but it actually looks quite good. What fun would it be if an old killer made  a reappearance with a new killer...
Hopefully this is not as bullshit as Scre4m was...
January 14 that’s my moms birthday
I guess sequels don't get numbers anymore
can’t wait for this movie !! i loved all the others :)
Can’t wait and it comes out on my birthday👏🏼👏🏼
No
The iconic hello sidny
Ah, I too just watched Scary Movie! Great film!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Tatum not dead, she's pretending dead.  Now come back for Sydney because miss old friend , now i know i just wake up 😅😅🤣🤣
I cannot watch this without thinking of Scary Movie
In this scream Stab franchise might get to 10th part 😂😂😂
*The killer is Matthew Lillard - mark my words.*
If scream keeps Making more season I’m for sure gonna sign up When I’m 18 Going to L,A
I can t take Scream serios anymore after watching scary movie. hahahah
Instead of the killers being two guys or a guy and a chick, how about the killers both being females?
I've literally been waiting my entire life for this
Drew Barrymore needs to have the cast on her show
Let’s fucking go. Absolutely love this franchise.   The “phone call” opening is such a classic. The movie officially starts once you hear that phone ring and you hear that voice.
Do y'all see how good my girl NEVE LOOKS??!!! She's glowinggggg 😩
what use to be gold has been turned to dust.A rendition on new garbage. RECYCLE i hope this movie flops. o and btw "Dewy"-smell my finger"
Never liked these shit movies. Halloween is the real deal
I want it now 😍
If he said “it’s an honor” that implies that he has never met Sidney before so it can’t be anyone Sidney knows personally
Wait, this is still a comedy yes? Xd
bro please not Jenna Ortega bruh please
I am thinking Dewey is the killer as seeing that this new Ghostface is mostly seen getting the jump on his victims due to dewey being old and not able to run as much. I know one scene showed him running but he is still able to now and again. Only thing that counteracts my theory is ghostface when face to face with Sydney says "its an honor," implying its his/her first time meeting her.
Fantastic. Waiting from India 🇮🇳
They should stop afther Scream 3 " We know the back story from Sid, her brother did it, Roman the lost Child from Sid's mom.
Scariest Movie Of The Year.
Everyone please buy a ticket and support this movie! The directors and writers put in so much work and effort for us fans. Don’t let this new “strand” of covid scare you away. This will be with us for the rest of our life’s. Go out and live…. I’m telling you, you don’t wanna miss seeing scream on the big screen. Just being in a theater and hearing the gasping or the screams is such a incredible experience. This movie deserves success. Look at Spider-Man it broke records this month and we can do the same for Scream.
Wassup 😂😂😂😂😂
After scary movie this trailer is too funny🤣🤣🤣
This is my child hood coming back I can’t  wait y’all scream is back and better than ever. Now I heard that Mathew pillars is supposed to make a return like he didn’t die in the first movie could he be the killer
Man, Dewey has to die in this one, he has been dodging it for too long.
when the heck did a Scream 4 come out
Just put scream 5
STUPID MOVIE.
After watching the trailer like 82837383 times, I’m pretty sure that Liv is a killer. Remind me on January 13th if I’m right. See ya! 💀
DAMN. I so intended not to watch this, especially not in theatres (if it is shown in them), because this is not canon. As in the script not written by Kevin Williamson and as far as I'm aware not even the framework. But this damn trailer makes this look way too intriguing and appropriately dark for the next step from Scream 4's events...So much so that I may find myself paying for whichåever streaming service this first release on, just so I can see this. Of course a major attraction is the Original actors.  But this isn't worth risking Covid by seeing this in theatres, I skipped even the chance to see the original Scream in a theatres last Halloween because of it so I'm certainly not risking it for this. But this sure seems to be way better than I expected. Then again, trailers can be very misleading. And I'm not going to pay a LOT. Likely try to take advantage of a free trial or deep discount for a streaming service or just rent...in case the twist sucks. It could suck, even if it was Williamson's. I pretend Scream 3 never happened, 1, 2 & 4 are my head-canon. Will be nice to see if this joins them despite of not being actual canon at all.
Fun fact: Scream is based on a real string of murders in Gainesville Florida. Guy was going around murdering college girls and it turned out, he was previously responsible for 3 murders before that and one attempt in Louisiana
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
🤦
😂
one scream is getting old and getting played out two who releases a halloween movie in january?
Never saw a Scream movie in theaters. Super excited to see this in a packed Theater.
Omg did you know that Tara carpenter aka jenna ortequ I never knew she was in this awesome horror movie  plus she is in stuck in the middle  my favorite show   And when Sidney Prescott aka neve Campbell when she says are you ready  to Gale Wethers aka Courteney cox from friends my other favorite  show Then gale weather's says  this? Never. I am. So excited. For this to come out
I hope they do a jumpscare where courteney cox suddenly comes into the picture. With her facelift she is scarier than the psychopath with the mask on.
Oh Courtney Cox why did u do whatever u did to your face? Your where naturally beautiful
Well I can't wait!! This looks like it will be fantastic!  I'm just waiting on the killer to be Sidney...or Dewy! Lol! After all they've been through...that's enough to drive someone crazy!
She says "it brings us all back here" and shows Stu's house. What does that mean? Does that mean we will get a cameo from Stu???
PG what
This got me fucked up
this movie looks like it would scare my grandmas dentures out of her mouth.
I been waiting on this For a Long Time Fuck Covid I’m going to See this the second it comes out ~CJaySpenzo
It doesn't look funny. The main premise of Scream was the fact that it was satire, so I hope they don't fuck it up
I said $h!t like 8 times and it's only the trailer lol
If Paramount pictures is going to pick this up who may transformers in a lot of other dumbass movies make it epic I want to know about Marine Prescott 1995 death I want flashbacks I want a good damn movie I don't want some piece of s*** garbage for 2021 cash grab
I love how everybody is so excited for this when scream 2,3, and 4 is this remake if you kill one of the OG 3 I will walk out of the theater
This preview gave away all the deaths didnt it?
What if the killer is finally her dad, or Sid herself, or even Stu?
"I won't sleep until he's in the ground" is my favourite line
I just love this franchise... Love all d characters n desperately waiting for d 5.... I think this is one of the best horror thriller movie Hollywood has ever produced...
I really can't wait for this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Top five films in no particular order : Scream (1st movie) The Shining Heat Seven The Usual Suspects
Yes let's go I'm in the movies asap
I cant fucking wait
The Scream series is the only series in horror I can truly like, theres no ghosts, no boogie man, no supernatural powers, and no twisted games because they think theyre the good guy. It's an asshole with a knife and they enjoy watching you die bloody.
Love you  scream movie  🙌🙌🙌🙌👐👐👐🙌🙌🙌
I like how ghost face is an idea rather than a specific mortal individual and how the idea of ghost face can be anyone and as a concept can never truly die
2:00  Im convinced Dewey definitely dies. In other previews, you see her walking away from a van with the same jacket on and she looks worried. And in this shot you can tell she's obviously upset. Either Dewey dies or he gets seriously injured.
It’s the girl with the purple ombré and maybe Dylan Minette, I’m saying it now. If I’m wrong, I will live with the shame of being wrong.
They gave away some of the deaths though...
IM SO FREAKING EXCITED!!!!!!!!! Omfg!!!!
Sydney should just beat all their ass’s and get it over with.
Hmm Marley Sheldons (The Deputy) character seems suspicious to me!
4th part was trash and this looks even worse but i'm gonna watch it just for Neve Campbelle and Courteney Cox
These were my fav as a kid..born in 87👾👾👾
Soooo many good books that could be made into movies,  instead we kept recycling old ones
shit comes out a day before my bday
ABOUT TIME. I am extremely enthralled this is coming. ALWAYS wanted another sequel. If this is the last, thank you!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU&feature=emb_imp_woyt
Kinda cool seeing it in modern times with smart fones
This franchise keeps becoming more iconic per movie, love that they kept Courteney Cox on this amazing movie
The call is coming from INSIDE the Alexa....
What makes Scream so good is the fact that it was realistic.
Somehow I can't take that mask seriously anymore
It's cotton weary
I'm starting to think that Sidney doesn't show up till halfway. Cause when Dewey calls her, he says 3 attacks have already happened. And they call Sidney cause they know she has experience
LAAAME. Not scary, just cliche and derivative. It was fun when Scream 4 did it 10 years ago. Now it's gotten old. Unless one of the main trio dies, which they teased and failed to deliver in 4, this will just be rinse and repeat again. I also hate this stupid trend of giving your sequel the exact title as the original. It was bad and confusing when remakes did it, it's worse when a sequel does it.
Does anyone wanna bet that at least one of the killers is made obvious in this trailer?
I love their putting a new twist on it but yet making it a classic
I just got done watching the first ever scream, I’m really excited for this
How many of you have watched this way more than once and have essentially spoiled things for yourself? 🙋🏿‍♂️
😫Does this mean I have to watch Scream 4 ?… been avoiding it….
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Hello Sidney its an honor
Already bought my ticket in XD on the 13th at 10pm 😈
I think amber and Richie are the killers,here's why amber is too mysterious to be innocent and we barely know about her,Richie he could be the muscle and he could be the creepy bf for sam to fight off thats my prediction.
How many more scream movies can they make, seriously 😒
This makes me feel incredibly old.  Still unsurprising writers today can't come up with their own ideas, hell they can't even take old concepts and mold them into their own; now 99% of movies are just reboots. But either way, damned if I'm not going to go see it. 😂
Except no one has a land line anymore. 😂
To be honest after the first Scary movie i cannot take the Scream seriously.
Sidney when Ghostface calls her: ah shit, here we go again
Imagine if there was a movie where all the serial killers were part of the same universe.  Like what they did with marvels avenger. You know that kind of stuff. I think that would be a good idea. I think they should. Like jigsaw, pennywise, chucky, leatherface, jason, freddy Krueger, pinhead, Hannibal lector. What do you guys think? I think it be cool.  More brutal.
Who asked for this???
Hell yeah!!!!
I believe the killer is Randy's sister Martha. She's been spotted on set, we might be watching a Mother/Daughter killer combo.
Tell me why I saw all 4 movies just to reminisce before I found out about this  " its an honor"
Honestly the ghost is kinda cute 😏
would’ve been better without the old ones.
I was super excited about Toy Story 4 and I think I'm just as excited, if not more, for this movie.
Dude thank u, it actually looks more original slasher than all this bullshit paranormal, escape room, freakin same chit, gah.. I juss want goofy slasher.
You should know about the Gainesville FL. Murders that inspired this franchise.
This is starting to get too real.  As I get older and more experienced in writing and producing music and as I study the human mind, I am no longer terrified by horror movies, I am terrified of something far deeper.  And if they made a horror movie of my greatest fear than I wouldn't be surprised.  Imagine we fast forward from 2022 all the way to 2092...  And what we see, isn't what we had expected.  What if the future of flying cars, electronics, and beyond, wasn't coming.  What if instead, human spoils, lead to a narcissistic and strange world of people without feelings...  What if instead of zombies and the zombie appocolypse.  We had a world of psychos, and a psycho appocolypse.  What if, without noticing, over decades and decades and decades of social influence and exposure to violence and grousom events, leads to a sick world that hyper justifies everything.  I'm thinking worse than the purge.  A world rotten, rotten to the core, where the zombies are capable of rational thought yet, normal just isn't quite what it used to be.  This horror movie would be called, MK Ultra.  And it will show you a world where humans become so Godless and so messed up, that death would be more preferable over living in this world.  I see sick people demanding more...  More violence, more insanity, more...  So what line do we cross when it's no longer just a movie behind a screen.
Hell yh stop playin
Just started watching the original scream movies....such cheesy cheap horror, but I absolutely love these movies
This is why you shouldn't get electronic locks
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
So you give friends access to your security systems? Right. Lame. Of course, they could have killed the parents first, but that doesn't seem like the case here. A security system like that would have movement cameras and yard lights and beeping notifiers to the killer that they know someone is prowling. The security systems I know notify the whole house, not even people home that there is someone at any door.
😜funny
2022 man that’s a wait 🥵
It bet not be no ducking supernatural shit
2:04
the title should of been "5cream"
Are yall gonna kill jenna that early?
I think richie kitsch could be Billy/ sid secret child and richie was adopted and I'd like all for sid/ Billy child to follow in sid footsteps?
I’m so f*****g ready for this!
Suddenly got a feeling to buy a house phone. My house aint built to be running around in it tho. 1 wrong turn and it's over. Actually, any turn and it's over.
Americans will know who Ghostface is before I watch it!
SPECIAL OFFICER DOOFY REPORTING FOR DOOTY
They better not kill Sydney
I can’t wait
Notice how Dewey said Attacks instead of murders, what if all the "victims" the people who were "attacked" are the killer as a group, planning to finally kill Sidney, Gale, and Dewey once and for all to finally end the nightmare in Woodsboro!  It's amazing how different people keep snapping and become ghostface
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1vKE7QpUJw&t=320s
LITERALLY CHILLS
Any one notice how the girl with purple in her hair, cracks her neck like Billy did at the end of the1st scream right when he was about to shoot gale weathers?
Gail screaming with grief in slow motion with sirens parked behind her while they try to keep her away tells me that Dewey dies 😭 theyre divorced irl too so they prob only agreed to do the film if one of em got killed off the show. Unless Dewey is the killer n he's the one on fire n Gail just found out in the worst way. Either way Dewey dies it appears
Looking forward to it!!!🎄❄⛄
Good to see one of the og horror films come back with some spice. Ohh heads up,... you really should pick up the phone.
I like how Dewey says "something feels different about this one" ....as Wes Craven is now sadly passed away and even though it's still a meta horror like the rest, it's got a diff feel cause Craven didn't direct this one. Big shoes to fill though. Craven was genius. So im glad they did what Craven woulda done n pointed out the difference right in the script. The movie def seems darker than the first 4 that Craven did....But from what I'm hearing so far, the two brothers who directed this 5th Scream movie, would have 1000% made Craven proud. 😊 Cant wait to see it!!
I hate that every famous slasher classic is Getting a reboot except Friday the 13th franchise which was tremendously good and scary
17 million views🥰
Not the wheel chair guy💀
Masscare Start
I love scream and I can't wait for the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope Gale is the killer. It would make the whole series come full circle. The narrative  about the media.  1st Scream, movies/media doesn't make psycho's it makes them more creative.  2nd Scream, the killers wanted to be famous through the fallout in court.  3rd Scream, going to Hollywood where media is king.  Gale got famous off of Sidney's mother in the first Scream, made the book in the second, and had a franchise based off her books in the third. Gale has always been there. It would play into the "If it bleeds it leads" world we live in, and how the media are the real killers.
makes me feel old thinking that Courtney and David were married for 14 years and divorced all the way back in freaking 2013! what the heck. wish they'd stayed together but loving they decided to bring the movie back this looks so good.
I’m calling it, it’s Dylan Minnette
I sensed this was coming, and I am happy to see it
I hate that jenna ortego dies first
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
I gotta see it just because my boy Dewey reloading the 6shooter

So basically the same as before... THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE EPIC

1:18 she's the ghost face killer (may b), 60% sure...
who else is here cos of larray
seems a tad too serious
Soooo excited
At this point I'm convinced that "Ghostface" is actually a demon that periodically possesses new people solely to have them ruin Sydney's life.
Omg everyone I got a leak from a friend and I know who the killer is and even I didn't believe it!!!. But not gonna spoil it.
Тема
This movie can never be horror until this ghost is here 😂😂😂😂
scream 5? lez go
Can't wait see if I watched that one of my favorite new scary movie soon lol and I'm ready for this
Whoa looks vicious! I’m so in. I don’t like the robo bullshit but everything else. Hell yes
wat is SHE 50 NOW LOL
PURE CASH GRAB
That part where Gail is being restrained and looks really upset, I think Dewey dies :/ One of the 3 are gonna die in this movie I just have a feeling so I’m preparing myself!!
I got to go see that
I’m sorry, but the smart home locking and unlocking makes me cackle EVERY time like that’s so ridiculous and I L O V E it
As much as I love the original Scream and Ghostface this looks generic as fuck, I’ll watch it but I’m not expecting much
Who Still Watching🔪
Idk scary movie feels more Scarier than this movie 😂😂
opinion:this is probs the first scream movie to give me goosebumps
Happy  Michael  bay didn do that it would  get a lot  of heat
Finally Dewey brawling back. Instead of getting beat up easily
Huey!
Нихуясебепиздец
1 month AWAY OMG
My girl is back🖤
Something not so LGBT just happened to me seeing dewey with a beard
The more I see these, the more I'm worried Mindy won't make it to the next one. 😭😭
In all honestly I'm still waiting for a remake or whatever of the classic film The Shining... still waiting for that one......
Not to sure
Are they passing the torch?? Lol
Idk how I feel about this. I think that we will sit though this 90 minutes just to see Sydney, Dewey and Gail survive AGAIN😐🙄😩
When Dewey says something about this one just seems different that could be a clue …
Pleeeaaassseee be good pleaseee
From 1996 to 2022

orphan prequel when?
Actors today looks so plain and forgettable. We used to hire actors/actresses that had a distinct look.
Since Paramount acquires 49% of Miramax (the one who did the original Scream) distributed this new film! How original, reminds me of imposter among us!
This feels like Saw + Halloween. Anyone else?
Waaaaaasssssuuupppp
I feel like they're gonna make Sidney and/or Dewey and/or Gale die in this one, and I'm gonna be furious if they do.
Boring!
Hope he kills them all this time ending it with a bang!
And I do hope to see the original cast in Scary Movie new sequel... Can we have it? Pleaseeeee....
Hey they got Courtney cox in this
I’m really really looking forward to this I’m a huge fan of the scream franchise I’ve seen all the previous movies in the series can’t wait to see the new one in January
The originals better not die!!!
🔥🔥
2:14 What is that sound?
I don't know if I'm already made this comment here or not but is there anyone else that feels like the opening scene here is just another Stab? Probably the actual opening scene if so?
scary man\horror\psy screamer=  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDHWqRdgQMY
Yessssssss !!!! Childhood souvenirs 🤭
Who’s the old lady with Sydney? Is that supposed to be her mom?
Omg what if the Killer calls Judy about her son like he did with Cotton about Christine in Scream 3!!!
WAY TO EXCITED TO SEE THIS , HURRY UP ❕
Let’s gooo ghost cult 😈
one thing that wont make this work is the fact that its now an extremlely serious horror movie when it comes to the killings!! in the first ones it was fun now its just brutal and dont think its gona work
I had a problem watching the 1996 version. I really couldn't stand it when she wouldn't turn the stove off when the pop corn was ready. J
After seeing this I recognise scary movie
nice
1. Passion 2. Revenge  3. Jealousy 4. Expectation 5. ?
You know, Ghostface is human. As long as you FORCE yourself to keep calm in this fcked up situation and think rationally, you have a chance of winning... If he bleeds, you can turn the tables around.
Hello sidney its an honor
Okay so apparently, they are coming out with a new Texas chainsaw massacre as well. I’m sad though because unlike the scream trailer, even though you can tell it’s a modern day version. It still feels like scream. Cheesy slightly bad acting but not the worse. Stupid teenagers. It’s like a good cheesy classic. But the Texas chainsaw massacre is affiliated with Netflix I think. Watching the trailer it just did not feel like Texas chainsaw massacre. Felt like Hostel. But then again, Hostel was EXTREMELY bloody and graphic. That trailer is none so I’m not sure. Disappointed but hope I’m wrong. Scream doesn’t look disappointing so far so that’s good!!
Gay
I remember thinking ghostface was like michael myers and jason
SURPRISE KIDS!!!  Despite all he's done in the past, Dewey still doesn't get respect from anyone. Gale on the other hand, has finished in every aspect, especially career.They have been abandoned by everyone, especially Sidney. No matter how much Sidney sees them as friends from the past, she stays away because they remind them of the past.  Therewithal Gale and Dewey cannot get rid of the victim psychology they have lived for a long time and eventually they reached a breaking point psychologically and decide that they have to become hunters to get rid of their weak victim psychology.  Using all their experience, they turn into the most dangerous ghost faces. The metal mask is a reflection of this. After all they are the only ones who see the brother who was shot in the head.  While they are planning to take revenge on the society, two more new age killers appear and start to murder before them. They give these new killers some time to hide themselves and one of these new killers is Billy's relative. Vince, who said on the phone “it's an honor”.  After a while, Dewey and Gale stop hiding behind the new generation of killers and start hunting them.  Sidney slowly begins to get suspicious.  Meanwhile, Sidney is more alone than ever and gets help from an unexpected person; Vince who survived Dewey's attack by being injured.  Sidney and Vince who were left alone decide to team up.  However, Sidney is betrayed by Vince, as expected, and Vince and Gale severely injure Sidney. They leave her by thinking that Sidney is dead, but she survived for the last time and was found by the townspeople.  Sidney wakes up in the hospital. Now her character has reached a breaking point and she finally understands that she cannot escape from being the hunt without turning into a hunter.  While Sidney lying in her bed we see someone who is wearing a red and green striped sweater comes in with rotten flowers which stolen from a cemetery in his hands and he give them to Sidney.   When he lift his head, we see that his face is completely slashed.  He is Stu!  The End...
Horror legend is back again
When you’re upset COVID didn’t kill enough people. 😝
I just realized the irony behind life. Everyone wants everything ASAP. But when faced with the promise of death, everyone says “no stop. wait, wait, wait.”
https://youtu.be/JzXV3_-Q7CQ  Scream 2 is free to view on YouTube. One of my favorite ones. But also, I love how serious this one seems. Just glad it’s coming out a week after my birthday. 2022 is starting off strong.
Neve is still a babe
I was ghostface for Halloween in 5th grade lol. I wish I could still get scared by horror movies.
I hope this isn’t dumb as the new Michael Myers movie where almost every time they had him and never made sure he was dead that movie felt more like a action movie with a boner but micheal getting his ass beat and then killing everyone he just had problems with and I am sorry all the characters in that movie was dumb as fuck even more dumb then normal horror movie characters
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
So Neve Campbell is looking GORGEOUS!! I like the modern tick they could gang-bust the box office all over again if they play this one right.
I love this franchise
Finally!
was that billy? if he got 25 years he'd be out this year, turning the ignition off
WAZZUUUPPPP
Amber and sam is definitely the ghostface
I wonder what number the Stab movies are at by this point
Damn
Hopefully Jenna Ortega doesn't get killed and the movie bu ends up being the opening attack instead of the opening kill
RELEASE THE SONIC TRAILER
Sidney is the one to get stabbed by Sam😱😱
January horror movies are so bad 😂
The copper will be the killer.
esta
Wanna see a scene of the killer in costume f*****g a girl from behind dog**st**e in bed in this movie…
Scream: "Are you all alone?" Me: "Wazzup?" Scream: "Oh, great, another one." :3
00:21 Reference from Jigsaw
I love these movies! every single one!!!!
"Can i say you something... I see dead people...."😱
What’s your favorite scary movie?
I remember my sis made me watch the original first 2 with here when I was in grade school and she was in middle school back in the 90’s. We were so scared back then 😂😭
I for one love the Scream Films. 😱 🎥
We need special officer Doofy!!!
My childhood is ruined.
So no one told her life was gonna be this way.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
If I was in a Scream movie and knew that Sydney lived in the same state as me I'd just move to another state. I mean why take the risk
I love how the scream movies keep the original cast in them you know like other horror films will do remakes but it's always different characters I think keeping the same characters is what keeps them from being dumb "sequels' which in all reality are just horror films using the same movie name to gain viewers and up ratings
0:35 I thought,this was a commercial! But it’s a movie a reboot movie!! Theyre gonna ruined and F everything up like they did to Chucky,Halloween and IT!! It’s not Halloween it’s Christmas!
Scream always has funny memes
No ghost movie can beat serial killers movies, they should do more serial killers movies than ghost/possession genre
Joe Goldberg saves her
I thought this was a joke like the faze or pete davidson thing then i see him murder some people and im like "i dont think this is a meme anymore
Do you like bad movies?
I like it
Or helll they could ever do sleep away camp too
If they’re rebooting these movies they need to reboot every nightmare on elms street, and every Friday the 13th
The intro. Was that Sid's original house?
I thought it was a security ad for a second did any one else think that or is it just me
Seeing this is great since I just found an old Scooby Doo clip that referenced Scream while advertising Scooby Movies
This comes out on my birthday ❤️👻🔪
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
I love this mask man 😂👍
DAmn, I actually just find out who the killER is. I put the dots together and figured it out. I can’t wait to See this, I Won’t say anything right now but when the movie comes outT, I will be right back to this comment, and of course if I’m wrong, I will definitely admit it, but I’m about 99% sure who it is. 😉 See y’all in January 14, 2022.  Edit: just like I said I was coming right back to this comment when I watched the movie, I watched it tonight anndddd I was wrong but definitely came to admit if I was just like I said. But the movie, holy shit, must watch. 😊
16 mill 👀❤️
So I have a theory. Basically everyone ''ghostface'' that's been killed has just been a ''bring along'', or people that wanted to play as the real ghostface, as the real ghostface actually killed his victims, which the people that probably played his position got too into character while they became clumsy and insane, and ended up paying for for the price. So in reality, the real Ghostface hasn't been revealed yet.  (I'm just having fun with it, it really doesn't make sense if it went that way lmao)
Why wasn’t I told about this like a month ago what I can’t wait!!!
Martha Meeks is the killer.
Okay I need a scary movie now
As if we need another scream movie to encourage the sicko disenfranchised youth that keep mass killing because the far leftist agendas across the western  world have come home to roost. Only lefty Hollywood would think this is a good idea.  Satan is now a leftist extremist.
Nice to see Deputy Hicks making a return..
Rule #1 , Dont run because they will hear the steps of your shoes.
My money is on the killer being Tatum (Sydney’s friend in Scream 1 who got caught in the garage door…..Stu’s garage door)
Wow
Hello Cyndy 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Meh
BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
There are certain rules to surviving. 🔪
Let's go I can't wait for the movie to come out
Ok from the lock door scene one of the killers is probably a hacker, cause there is usually two of them, and since this movies always are so umpredictable its gonna be the one we least suspect or maybe because they know we are gonna think this the killer is gonna be the one most suspicious or maybe it will be a carachecter we dont even see until the review or maybe, you know what forget it. I will just shut my brain until it comes out
POTENTIAL SPOILERS:                                          richie is the killer in his poster he looks sinister then in the tralier ghostface is taller then dewey  Well dewey is 5'10 Richie is 6'1  And sam is stabbing someone with brown hair  Hes the only mf with brown hair.. well execpt for chad but im pretty sure chad dies  My guess us amber and richie are the killers but after richie dies a third ghostface shows up and lights amber on fire before lighting stu's old house on fire And then the movie ends
honestly for this movie to actually be good and not just another scream movie, a main character weither needs to die or be the killer themself. If this isn't the case then this is just a movie we've seen many times before.
*That's me on Verdansk*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
And, Hollywood decided to just call it "Scream" because we all lost count and no one cares what number sequel this is...Not like anyone will confuse it with "Scream" or think it's a reboot of a 1996 film by the same name? Na...
I hope the killer's identity isn't revealed for once. And we get a on going mystery into the next film at least. I think that would be genius for the new Scream.
Michael Myers Halloween end Scream
I’m excited but scared at the same time. I’m afraid the trio will be broken up just look at Gayle screaming at 2:01 it’s got me thinking something happened to Dewey. I’m just assuming tho but I’m hope I’m wrong.
Ever since Halloween (2018) came out, slasher movies have really been revitalised, and ironically seem to be copying how Halloween (2018) used the same title as it's original, Candyman did it, scream is doing it and now Texas chainsaw massacre is doing it, honestly I think we owe it to Halloween (2018) for bringing the genre back and should respect that film a lot more now.
This look promising will be a great storytelling
<---  Watch the movie here.
That was like the whole movie
Why hasn’t there been a real voice changer with Ghostface yet?
The darkest part of the series!
What’s the best scream movie?
‘I’m Sydney Prescott, of course I have a gun’ is such a good line
They did amazing with not giving too much and not showing a story line or showing the movie from start to ending with an idea of what to expect! Can’t wait!!!! I’m freaking out! 😱
That part with Dewey emptying the gun cylinder onto the ground was badass, chill as a cucumber, staring down Ghostface like a boss
Childhood memories! I quote "you were my 90s" (Becca Sydney's publicist scream 4) Most definitely ONE of my favorite horror movie franchises of all times!!!  Will be WILD if STU comes back in this!
Matthew Lillard (stu)  is the killer
Door locked. Door unlocked
I can't believe it Iam so excited for this
i cant wait until this comes out
https://youtu.be/EfNLralb5Dk
It’s like scary movie 😅😅
Appropriate use of hacking smart home locks in a horror film. Beautiful.
i missed scream
Is it ever occurred
2:06 The "Hello Sidney" never gets old😂
Dumb girl opens door so she can get cut. Plus having all her house by electronic so it can be hacked. Smart.
Maybe Sidney’s twin is the killer🙈🥶😱😱😱
2:02 spoiler alert !!! Look at this, keep clicking on it
I’m here everyday 24/7 until the new trailer arrive.
"Three attacks so far"  3 killers confirmed?
CALLING IN IT! its the girl in the pink hair and clay jensen ;)
About time they made a new scream yess
January release movies don't do well. That's why the other blockbusters are out in mid February. Waning movie franchise. Pass.
i like the vid/trailer but i want to have diislike button
I wonder if it’s Sidney’s mom
16 million views🥰
shot in the dark but i think it will be tara. idk man but if they're going to go with the 'something's changed' theme they have to revisit the beginning, what made scream incredibly popular was drew barrymore, or more specifically her killing off in the first ten minutes. i just think it would be cool if they tricked us like that and completely redefined the franchise in the last movie. idek how that would work lmfao just thought it would be cool.
TRASH
I don't think I've ever been so excited about a movie in my entire life!!!!!!!! IM READY TO SEE IT
Courteney Cox's bad plastic surgery is 100x scarier than Ghostface
Very excited looks like it will be full of surprises and intense kills 🔪

I know they kinda had to do it but I’m gonna say it anyway  *WHO HAS A LANDLINE ANYMORE* 🤣
1996: Do you like scary movie Sidney? 1997: Hello Sidney, Remember me? 2000: Do you think it's over Sidney? 2011: Welcome home, Sidney. 2022: Hello Sidney, It's an honor.
PERFECT.
i'm excited.
hell yah so excited
0:21 wait thats the wrong movie
0:20
There are rules
I love the camera angle at 50 seconds.
2022
I'll just have to wait for it to come out I guess. Not a huge fan of the quick and easy kill at the beginning though. Gotta credit the original for it's slow burn in setting things up. There's good reason why "Do you like Scary Movies" is still an iconic cinema scene.
Just imagine if Jill got away in the 4th one and realizes there’s new killer in town 💀
Still has that small ass knife I see 😂 can't wait to watch it tho
😍Боже я так долго ждала спасибо !!!
😱😱😱😱😱
We want stu back
Ghost face: hello Sidney…it the honor
Wanna bet this time, the killer is some crazy fan of Sidney's?
This looks  bad. They should have left it alone. It’s a parody at this point and the new cast……. Could you find anymore generic cw extras??? You bring back Judy Hicks from Scream 4? The one character with absolutely 0 character development? If they’d have pulled Kirby I might have been on board but this looks worse than Scream 4. If they’re centering on the new cast this is gunna flop HARD. No-one cared about the new cast in 4 no-ones gunna care about them in this.
You see, this is why I don't buy IOTs! Those gadgets can be hacked by any script kiddie who plays the "Watchdogs" series!
What they should have done is have Jill survive Scream 4 to continue in Scream 5 in which she really is being stalked by a ghostface killer but the killer turns out to be Sidney in the end.  And if they don't kill Sidney off they can do a Scream 6 where Jill comes back again still playing the victim but faces off against Dewey and gale who are the new ghostface duo killers!  Classic case where the heroes become the villains!!!
So Scream has become its own universe now? The characters leveled up so much and are so meta that they're self-aware of their own movie-verse and it's rules and plot devices? Even when they change.
Hoping for Stu... again...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
I really loved Scream. Saw the first and second one several times.
I have a felling that the trailer is going to be better than the movie
Wtf really this better be the last one i dnt wanna scream 6 in 2028 lmao
Clay Jensen finally lost it
ITS THE GIRL IN THE PINK HAIR AND THE GIRL WHO PLAYED THE MANSON CULT FOLLOWER SADIE in once upon a time in Hollywood CALLING IT NOW
Come on give us a second trailer please!?!?!
Main characters still here that's the best part .
Seems like this will be the best one of all scream movies.
Billy's motive: He had already killed Maureen Prescott. He got his revenge. In killing Sidney, he want to make a film on his own.  Stu's Motive:Peer Pressure Mickey's Motive: Political Debbie's Motive: Revenge. Avenging his son's death Roman's Motive: Sibling Rivalry and Jealousy. He was tired of being upstaged by his younger sister.h Charley's Motive: He was in Love with Jill, the mastermind and idea person.  Jill's Motive: She wanted to become Sidney, the highly famed ingenue. She wanted the stardom.  Scream(2022) Killers' motives: Revelation! The Final Mask Finally Comes Off!
DOORS UNLOCKED
R.I.P. Ghostface glitter robe
I'm glad this was remade yessss
Favorite thriller👻
And they say you don’t need pistols or an AR15. Thats why they all die in the movies and in real life
scary movie but serious
Imma be laughing at y’all being crybabies🤡 when the killer is NOT Stu 🤣😂😂😂
you know this is moslty based off a true event
We are counting down the days to see some really cool shit!
Looks like this movie will suck like 4th
Update this movie link when this is  release ... Personally on my ID ,OK
Do Tara and Samantha live in the Stu house?
Was this about Ghostface being in Black ops cold war?
Hindi dubbed please
This Scream is going to be more darker and serious! Can’t wait to see it!
Sidney is so used to her life being a shit that she doesn't give a fuck anymore lol  I wanna watch this one! 🖤 I'm not gonna miss it.
Espero que tenha personagens dos filmes anteriores !
Wou super tare succes în continuare om minunat felicitări pentru acest om minunat succes în continuare om minunat wou super tare wou ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Back for probably 100th time 😅 anyone else?
I can't F*****g wait!!!!!!
There are eco killers or one whos protecting ghostface,knows who he/she is DONT DO SPOLIERS!!!
THE HEAD TILT
Ghost  bagoledu Para bro
Is it January yet 😭😭😭😭
It feels good to see ghosty Boi again
nope
0:25 Yeah, that's real smart. Opening the door when you are being threatened by someone.
Don't tell me that Sidney and his friend is the killer villain this time! Stop that non-sense twist!
I want see this w my boyfriend but im scareddd, idk why I kinda have bad feel bc the ghostface thing so big on tik tok n remember n the movie that girl got stabbed I forget which scream it's it just seems like you can't have fun anymore but I hope I'm wrong I'm prolly just overthinking
Calling it on Two things: #1 First Scream FILM to NOT follow the rules, #2 Either Sydney, Dewey, or Gale....or All 3 die! Mark my words friends!
At least he's wearing a mask!!!!
A link to the past. *secret sound*
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Thanks for basically showing me the whole movie in 2+ minutes
I'll be right back!
My childhood horror/suspense movie
“hello sidney, it’s an honor” LITERAL CHILLS EVERYTIME!!😭😭
is that jigsaw at the 20 second mark?
I don't think Jenna Ortega is the first kill of the movie, when "Amber" said: you should awnser the phone she seems pretty scared already, like she know what's happening to her, and the first victim in scream always play with the killer a little before shit goes down.
OK so we are bringing back the "past"could  Bloodhound Gang make a soundtrack for this?!!!
0:50- 0:55 dbd be like
The killer is probably one of the past characters lol
Lets all appreciate the times before modern technology existed 😌 back then you couldnt hack a door 👏🏻👏🏻
Looks like Scream 5.
WHAAAZAAAAAAP!!!!!
I thought scream was supposed to be a joke.  This looks by the numbers slasher flick.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Am i the only one thinking the tone of this trailer doesn't really match with original movie series? Origin scream series was much more lighter and creative than this trailer one. It kind of looks like halloween/friday the 13th rip off. :(
so excited for this!!!
The attacks are on people related to the orginals killings that what she said
.....so the new ghost face is a hacker

I'm so excited for this as a horror movie buff! I'm also so glad that they cast David, Neve and Courtney since they've been in ALL of the previous Scream movies...🎞🎬🎥
Wild
I'm not leaving until I get a waaaasaaap
"Scream"  You couldn't give it a subtitle if you didn't want to call is Scream 5?  Like Scream Legacy or something.  Also, I'll give it a shot.  But Wes had an idea for the first 3 and only did the fourth when he had a fresh idea for it.  So we'll see.
Oh this will never get old.
holy shi
I’d actually be pissed off if the movie finally gave us the twist thT Dewey was one of the killers all along
At least Wes craven new millennials were not entitled to the title of the 1996 scream What makes this new piece of shit generation better than mine nothing and if I see any of the OG’s die I hate this movie there you go that’s a true scream fan if millennials were not worthy in 2011 your ass is a worthy in 2022 Don’t redo scream 3 twice! Scream four was good enough not worthy of the title with a way better cast This ain’t no Halloween reboot Requall bullshit do it right I don’t fuck with the title at all
Hate to say it scream 4 had a way better cast! It felt like a Wes Craven movie smart intelligent not perfect but the best since 1996 not digging this at all im sorry
Huge scream fan this trailer is not cutting it for me scream one 1996 and SCREAM 4  are my favorite! Scream for at least new millennials or not worthy of the title so what makes this generation so better
CALL IT SCREAM 5, DON’T GIVE IT THE SAME NAME AS THE ORIGINAL ITS A SEQUEL NOT A REMAKE!!!
Im probably not into horror movies yet but I'm just here for the kill count.
Why the same name for another movie
I really hope the movie won’t be explaining all the past events like how this trailer did…
WAZZAAAAAAAAP
Wazzzaaaaa!!
Why would you open the door if someone called you threatening you?-
and then you hear.. "WHAZZZZUUUUPPPP"
you know what. i have my doubts about this revival.. but then again, I had my doubts about Scre4m .. and it was perfection! hopefully this will be the same !
I CANT WAIT. IM SO HYPED
I hate when movies just stop saying numbers and just title the sequel the name of the original movie. I really hope they make fun of that trope in this movie.
This is like fear street kind of
yawn🥱
This looks dumb af
I don't know why, but to me the cell phone calls are just not as scary as landline calls. It represents a time when if you are out in the middle of nowhere, it actually would be harder to get help!
Kyle Gallner was in A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010). A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) exists in the Scream universe [mentioned in Scream 4]. Kyle Gallner is in Scream (2022). 🤯🤯🤯
Can’t wait
This seems more of a real modern horror movie. Security systems go out of your control and your phone just notifies you everything is unlocked as much as you try to control it. And like everyone says this Ghostface killer seems it is out for revenge. The eerie feeling almost relates to first original scream.
I dont get how you can make a whole franchise from a guy with a ghost mask and a knife
This looks decent but I just imagined the movie being about the woman and the killer repeatedly locking and unlocking the doors for 90 minutes.
At first I thought that it was a rumor that they were making another scream movie but I'm glad it's coming!! Can't wait!!!!
YES!! Finally a new horror idea that havent been seen 50million times before!!
Imagine they bring stu back for this
One thing I really enjoyed about the tv series is how they used social media to their advantage. Seems like that is also used here to great effect
This will be my first time seeing scream on the big screen can’t wait
I love how in the beginning she immediately declined an unknown number instead of just answering it.
They REVEALED THE KILLERS WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT LOL
looks bad

This is so dumb and cheesy.. when are they gonna learn that jump scares are not what scares people anymore?? Well at least me. Movies like midsommer and the lighthouse are scary. Not this bill shit
Comes out 2 weeks before my birthday  ✌💋❤🇮🇱
I hope there’s a Call Of Duty reference for the Warzone players.
HAHHAA i still feel like its scary movie.
can’t wait 😭💔💪🏼
1:38 paying respects to my boi Randy
I love Scream, and this comes out two weeks before my birthday. I might treat myself if I have the money and take my gf and I out.
This is SCREAM 5! You lazy screenwriter
SPOILERS FOR SCREAM 4: Funny I just realized that this killer isn’t the first one to tell Sydney “it’s an honor”, Charlie said it too in the fourth movie when Sydney comes to the film club meeting (albeit we don’t realize he’s the killer yet but still)
"Hello Sidney, it's an honor."
Wait, why'd she open the door??
What's with ghostface using a Jigsaw reference? I was waiting for the "what's your favorite scary movie" question
OMG THANK YOU SO MUCH! <3 SCREAM IS MY FAVOURITE HORROR MOVIE
If u pause exactly at 2:02 u could see Sam attacking someone with brown hair, could be Richie???? Or even a new character??
The killer is going after people related to the original killers.  My theory is the killers are a bunch of survivors
Smart homes KILL.............
I am so excited, also happy to see the original cast back, specially Courteney (Gale). Always loved the franchise and this looks very promising.
Waza película
Scream has always been the one franchise that legitimately scared me, as dumb as that sounds. Looking forward to this though.
Sick trailer.. I'll BE RIGHT BAAACK !!!!!
Boy, it better be stu
I'm watching this as much as I can because I'll never know when is the last time I'll be watching a new trailer for a new Scream film.
Uh oh, they keep calling the killer a he... Emma Robert's has entered
Who’s the killer in Scream 5?
THE SCREAM SERIES IS GOOD BUT THE SEQUEL OF ORIGINAL. MOVIE SETTING IS ONE OF A KIND
AFTER 10 YEARS SIDNEY PRESCOT IS BACK
so where does ghost face sacrifice a child?
Neve really doesnt age
They pulling a halloween 2018
It looks so stupid.
I looks awful. I look forward to watching it soon😁👌
Bummed this won’t be releasing next Halloween! But I’m guessing they don’t want to try to compete with the next Halloween movie 🤔🤷🏾‍♂️ I’m glad they brought back Doofy tho! I wonder if the vacuum cleaner will be making a cameo as well?!?! 💀💀💀
When I saw this add at first on a video, I thought it was gonna be an Uber eats add😭😭😭 it was not
The way he said "Hello Sydney" sounded like Stu's "Surprise, Sydney" from the og
:/// just meh   The iconic horror film rebooting their scream queens into gun ladies was done better by Halloween in my opinion
Ok, film 5 or is it 6, they have done so many of these films, if I was the killer in this one, I would blow up the female stars house up and make sure she’s in side, then I would go after some new blood, because going after her is boring as hell
not good
I find it genuinely chilling that this Ghostface considers it an honor to meet Sidney. Hoping for another great Scream movie 🤟
You must stop making This kind of movies. These shit inspired desperated peoples to do something bad.
Now relative of Sidneys is this one
OOH YEAH KANE AND KEKE REMEMBER THESE MOVIE'S
Yup it’s back to haunt me
And that’s why you don’t let your phone control your doors.
Holy shit they gave the guy from Cold War his own movie
I really thought the killer was going to be one of the “black” characters relatives  “She’s candyman’s daughter” in my Randy 🗣
If you dont want it to be spoiled, don't click read more.              I'm honestly thinking it's Stu
Can’t wait !!!!! Whooooo :)
Man I was hoping scream say wazzzzzup when she pick up the phone... 😂
Hahaha ok this looks like shit
Oh yes, this is what the world needs...another's Scream movie. WTF?
I honestly hope Matthew Lillard makes an appearance in this.
Anyone else think Gale will be ghostface? Or maybe Stu from the original
The humor is gone. This stuff has got all serious
OH YES!!! OHHHH YEEEAAAHHHH!!!!
I’m pretty sure ghost face isn’t really a normal killer I think he also has an adrenaline rush
"This isn't Amber"  Yea no shit
Is this an out of season April fools joke
Why couldn’t this be called Scream 5, Halloween did the same thing and it was stupid although it made sense and the timeline is already messed up however calling this film just scream is stupid
Jigsaw Halloween Wrong Turn And now... Scream.  Final Destination we're waiting
There was always a theory about Scream 3 that Angelina was a killer before some reshoots. I wonder if Roman fake killed her (as he did with himself) and she's now back for revenge. I think I remember her telling Sydney "it's an honor" when they first meet as well. Hmmmmm
Can’t wait to see it! The blood looks way too fake.
Omg it comes out on my birthday 🙏🔥
I know of scream,  don't really remember much about him
They're probably going to do a retarded scene where they kill him
Why I am thinking that in this movie the original cast will die! 😖😖
Bruhhhh
None of these movies were ever SCARY!!!! SO they make ANOTHER one?!?! For fvcks sake come up with another idea!!!!
Now we want Cindy Campbell scary movie back 😭😭😭
I can't believe they re-made this crappy-ass movie.
This look so good to watch with my family even im a kid i love watching horror
1:24 DYLAN!!!!!!!! I only came here because of wallows LOL
Sidney gonna die this time watch
I remember the young, curly-haired guy from creedence clearwater revival clip.
They really aged
I really want to see this movie
Woo hoo I’m so excited I’ll love
as long as they bring back stu i'll be happy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Wazaaaaaa
Scream is doing a Halloween
Can't wait. My high school vibe movie 👏👏👏
So the fact that she said "I won't stop until he's in the ground" tells me it's female and maybe a surprise cameo.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebaEpiesiJo yo here are some thoughts when the actors made the movie. your welcome ;)
Lol see thats what you get for having a smart home. NGL I actually want to see this movie. I hope it is made well and does well.
Is this Scream 5? Or sort of remake? Alternate-verse? 😆
I can't wait to see this, ghost face is my favorite killer.
HOLY MOLY 😎
We’ll that looks absolutely terrible
They were supposed to have stu orchestrate the killings from prison in scream three but scrapped it as they thought it was to dark to release after what happened at Colombine. (sorry if I’ve spelt it wrong).   It would be cool to see them have Stu in film 5 because it would come full circle plus from what I’ve seen from the trailer the killings in film 5 are linked into the past films so it would be a major twist if the killer was stu or the killer had something to do with him  It probably won’t be Stu because I fully believe he died in first movie but it would be cool if it turned out he survived
Actress Marley Shelton posted on her Twitter Account about Skeet Ulrich returning. I have a theory what if she meant her character and Skeet Ulrich character Billy Loomis had a son before him dating Sidney could be the Ghostface. Actor Dylan Minnette is playing a character name Wes Hicks that is related to her character
1:52 There were rumors that Judy is trying to get to her son after getting a call from ghost face threatening to kill him.
I teared up when I see Sidney in mature age and he said "Hello Sidney! ... It's an honor" at the end of the video. Feels proud to be millennial who had privilege to grow up with this thrill of four installments. My teenage hood 😭 Maybe the killer is Stu with disfigured face resulted from TV electrocution on his head.
WOOOOOOOOOO
I'm calling it now. Dewey is the killer. It seems like him and Gale have separated in this movie and he lives alone. Maybe he's mad about something that happened in their relationship.. Also he's the one that calls Sidney to get her involved. I'm probably wrong, but I just wanna leave this comment so I can look back on it later.
Deputy Judy is the killer along with a unidentified killer reveal at the end of the movie .
0:52 THE WAY SHE GOT DRAGGED LMAO
They should remake the IRL Scream killing too
Yes scream I love this it's going to be a banger 🔥
There going in a new direction and I’m here for it
I caint wait two see the new scream movie
I just hope that this movie and franchise won’t end up like the Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Alien Franchises the originals were extremely good but over time the modern or rebooted (sometimes both in Halloween’s case) just suck and kills the franchise. I loved the scream movies I just hope this one won’t take a turn for the worse like the other horror franchises. Still though looks good
Heard it first here. The killer is Sydney's original Father. Hence the "it's an honor"
How is this called Scream but it’s in the same franchise??? It’s technically Scream 5. And I guess it just ignored the two Scream tv series? I’m so confused
Is the movie not gonna be funny anymore ???
i hope Stu makes a comeback
This looks solid. I saw the original trilogy in the cinema. How long ago must that be?
I can't get over scary movie portrayal of this exact scene!
The legend is back mfers!
I love the franchise, but I’m not sure I’m thrilled about the direction of this film. It makes the survivors of past scream attacks seem like super hero’s that are called upon to come save the day
OMG I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT!!!
😱💀👻💘
This is just like halooween
I think the killer is a girIl , I guess it could be Stu or Billy sister , maybe she wants revenge for her mother and brother !
Meanwhile Warzone is now a place filled with Ghostface going around executing players
maybe sidney will finally realize she is, in fact, michael fucking myers
I mean I need a new scary movir
Ghost face yous still be calm a killing but now he is serious bring back old ghost face
Just saying, between Sidney Prescott, Laurie Strode, and Nancy Thompson, only one of them is undefeated.
This is way more intense than the previous Scream movie! ❣️💪
Jenna ortega is sooo fine
Honestly, when I first saw this in the ads, I thought it was going to be some Advertisement for a better phone bill, since the first scene included a phone.
Please be good! I hope everyone cast is a great actor. Performances make a big difference
As major fan since i saw it in theaters as a 12yo in 1996, i hope they honor Wes Craven properly
I don’t think you understand… i’m obsesses I really can’t wait to see it💖
What if....one of the characters is an online YouTube channel promoter doing a live "first watch experience of a stab movie and he gets killed live streaming...Meta huh? 😝👻😱🔪🩸
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
it's doofy.
Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox both look good still. Even better than when they were younger. Cool how they put in modern smart phone doors locking an unlocking. Scary.
YESSSSS YES YES YES YESSSSSYESSSSDD
This is gonna be awesome  💀🔪🎥
"How many times can you watch the Scream 2022 trailer?" *Yes*
Sidney is the new Nancy Thompson
I hope Matthew lillard is part of it lol 😂
I honestly think sam is one of the ghostfsce, here’s why, at the beginning of the trailer Tara gets a phone call and then the doors start locking and unlocking when she isn’t pressing unlock, since sam might live with them, I think she has the same app so she’s doing all the doors locking stuff
Why would she open the door
When i watch scream series, i cant stop laughing because all i think about it is the scary movie scenes😂
*the killer this time is obviously lynette fromme*
Basically all of this happened Morine Prescott slept will the wrong man & pissed everybody off ..👏🏾ready For this movie
Can’t wait 🔥
Well Sidney is back on it, must be a good one
Dewey will most likely die, they’re giving him a heroic arc in this, and you can see gale being held back by Sidney screaming with an ambulance in the background and deweys partner from scream 4 speeding with tears in her eyes
Hollywood as nothing better to do. Movies now in days just keep on getting worse. Then again movies like Scream always sucked anyways
Why kill someone when you can rape them😁
I feel like they showed too much in this trailer. Like, I know who's gonna die and how.
2022: what's a landline ??
I do like the og characters but i do hope they're not scared to kill them, that would kinda show no ones really safe
To be fair, it does follow the rules for a slasher franchise.
Can’t wait to watch this !!! I honestly didn’t think they were going to make another scream after the 4th film .
A movie will be so good if the old character meet the new character
That was the shittiest stab ever. No slashing sir, straight stabs. Slashing doesn't go deep, it just makes a flesh wound. If you want to kill them you have to stab deep into them.
Officer doofy is the killer
Kind of hard to say who this could be due to the many factors from the past Scream movies.  This Ghostface knows Sidney even though Sidney has made a name for herself but this Ghostface seems to lead victims toward's Stu Macher's house from the original Scream. his arms raising in one scene makes it look like he's praising, probably paying tribute to Billy and Stu. There's talk about Stu returning, but Stu's knife stabs involve 2 hands on the hilt and not just the right hand.  The trailer also says that the attacks are related to the original killers which I am still confused about that, why just target random people who are somehow going to be related about the original attacks?  My speculation is that this Ghostface killer is someone new who knows about the past 20 years later and is trying to complete the cycle by trying to kill Sidney, and what better way to draw her out than to put on the Ghostface guise and start killing random people.
Scary Movie Part 1 make me laugh after watching this Horror sequel teaser 🤣
Que emoción ver a actores de la primera película !!!
maybe by its an honor he means its an honor to kill her
Wait, wasnt this the comedy movie ?
I hope Michael Myers will be unmasked here and to see the real face behind the mask
😱😱😱 I can't wait
Victims are related to the previous killers? This is all about legacies, and them continuing the story in most franchises. Looks like the killer might be trying to set up previous killer’s relatives and perhaps make them at fault for their history in the family. It’s possible our new girl is related to Billy, possibly a sibling, and this Ghost Face is setting her up for killing legacies like her brother was famous for. Sidney likely has a moment where she has to trust Sam because all fingers point to her.
Why they gotta kill jenna first!!
Yesss. Another legendary horror franchise coming back.....Now, just bring back Jason(Friday the 13th), and Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it'll be complete.
WAZZZZUP!
disappointed they could have been all of this with scream 4 in 2011 with not a huge difference in technology that iPhone 5S the story was more Wes! and was not Paramount pictures which is normally a cash grab and screen for West craven with smart enough to say that my generation did not deserve to carry an alarm so you going to tell me that a generation that's 10 times worse than me has the right this movie better f****** be on point
Ghostface is back they rebooted the film again. We hope there will be another reboot of Friday 13th and we are hoping there will be another Final Destination film
How amazing would it be If in this film, Ghostface won? (As In they kill Syd) however they'd have to do it right, I mean there would be no easy way to kill her off, personally, Suddenly, unexpectedly, yet poetically, say killer 1 is able to slit her throat at the same time she slits theirs, they both bleed out, as the killer takes off their mask to reveal themselves as someone Syd knew/ loved
Ghostface in scream: *terrifying*  Ghostface in scary movie: *funny
I was 13 when the original hit theaters and I begged anyone old enough to take me resulting in seeing the classic four times in theaters.  This one does feel different I cannot wait to be scared but I feel like my nerves are going to make me pass out like one of those goats.
Moving on, coming to scary from the comedy
Stu makin a comeback
The movie 🎬 has the ghost of scary movie 🎬
The first scene is amazing 🤩  Doors unlocked…Doors locked… 🔪
I think this one the last one where Cindy now gets smoked
It's cool Courtney and David can still work together after divorce. I'd love to see Brad and Jen in a movie
My weird ass instincts are telling me stu and Billy never died and they both are the antagonists in this one it really feels like it's gonna be the last one and the final showdown and all.
Stu is back!  I can feel it!
Notice in that one shot in what seems to be a parking lot, ghostface is lifting the knife above their head right? In the original scream every time stu went for the kill he did the exact same thing which leads me to believe hes returned
*_Girl: Hello?_* *_Ghost face: Hello! What's your favourite scary movie?👻_*
DEWY GO BUY A GLOck and stop fukk n with that revovler
Honestly with all the cross over we are getting in media i wouldn't be surprised if this killer is danny and then at the end we see another horror icon (of course with some meta  humor at the end from danny ) this won't happen of course but it would be funny
Halloween over stop showing these lame as movies
I'm just gonna come out and say it, they didnt show Ghostface much, so I'm assuming the killer is a girl (since it's obvious to tell if it's a girl or boy) especially since there's only like 3 men, and 8 women in this film.
So let me get this straight… 3 years ago some Gen Y producer decides to give John Carpenter a call & say LETS REBOOT HALLOWEEN & dig up the franchise for the next 5 years….. Then suddenly CandyMan appears in 2021 ….Now this SCREAM…. Like WTH!!! Doesn’t that town in LA have ANY ORIGINAL IDEAS… Must we now endure Horror franchise reboots from the 80’s & 90’s all over again? The grandparents of Jason from Friday the 13 th. Descendants of Texas Chainsaw Massacre?Christ …. This is so pathetic.Thank God Netflix are buying original content from Korea & we can be ‘ENTERTAINED’. Instead of this trash.
May please do s  trailer review  love Lindsey 💖💖❤️💗♥️♥️ Idon’t want a copyright strike.I’ve never used any film or tv footage in YouTube video before I’m asking permission.
It's been 10 years :')
I'm never gonna take Ghost Face seriously when I know Scary Movie exists
So did they reboot the title back to SCREAM or is this SCREAM 5?
Spoiler Alert: Amber Freeman is the killer. You can see her hair while she’s burned alive by Sidney in 2:04 😚😚
I hope Dewey doesn't die
I love the first two seasons, but the third seasons, wast SHIIIIITTTTTTT!! As a blackwoman, I hateHow they want to associated gayism and blackrace and try to make blackWomen the carer for all, or theslave , or the laud.... It's just filled with stereotypical bullshitI of wokeshit.... hope they cancelled the entire season and start another one.. Written also terribly no one will watch it past 20 minute.. It was a good start, but they ruined it with stereotypes... this is what is wrong with America. .... they lose grip when they insert stereotypes and racismOr some nonsense shit like that. Terrible!
The reason I know it’s stu is because I can hear matthews voice
Yes!!!
That shot of Dewey reloading his gun looked so badass and I’m just proud of my man he’s come a long way from the dorky deputy in the first movie
Why does it look like Dewey and Gale aren't together in this movie??!
Why name 'SCREAM'? Its a fifth installment of the Scream film series! Call it 'SCREAM 5'!!!!! :D
The one time Harley Diaz loses and she has no invention to save her
Feels like the same recipe as the Halloween movies. Main character is older & has guns, killer comes back, kills half the town, main character & killer square off at the end, tbc
Yes!!! I can't wait for this 😈
Hey can we dub trailer of scream in Turkish and share it in our channel with link of this video?
When does this come out?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
imagine ghost face is the monkey.
You forgot to put the "5" after "Scream". Smh
Хахахахаха бля я так заржал как она ебнулась🤣
This looks *SO MUCH BETTER* than that awful, cringe worthy Scream TV show we got on Netflix. Hopefully this will wash that awful taste out of my mouth lol
Scream had Halloween playing as a movie and Halloween played Scream as a movie too. Kinda hope we get a Ghost Face VS Micheal Myers movie one day 🎃🔪
Is it me or all these horror franchise getting rebooted because we got  leprechaun, Halloween and Candyman now Scream hopefully Freddy and Jason is coming next
is this a reboot or A continuation of the plot?
I love scream movies, this one is gonna bring many old memories back
Yo it’s that character from Black Ops Cold War
I guess, "I Know What You Did Last Summer" is next. 😏
Cod Warzone 🤣🤣🤣
Who has a land line in 2021?
Not interesting anymore... Stop it! Get some help  🙂
Super excited with this one. Literally re-watch binged the last 4 movies after seeing this.
Scream 7 - geriatric shock
is on whatch list
I guess HOLLYWOOD is completely tapped out of ideas since they seem to only make remakes anymore.  What a JOKE?  Not sur why anyone would was their time with a remake.  I will be surprised if people don’t get upset when the new non-white characters are killed off.
La fecha de estreno es el mismo día de mi cumpleaños
https://youtube.com/shorts/RWrxw_cxnvo?feature=share
https://youtube.com/shorts/RWrxw_cxnvo?feature=share
I remember seeing them in Wilmington NC filming this movie and was super excited!!! Scream is my favorite horror franchise
So ghost face can hack ?   Oh boy.
Two key elements I noticed in the trailer.  The line is: The attacks are all on people who are related to the original killers. NOT killings. KILLERS.  Secondly. The killer specifically says at the end "Its an honor".  What if the twist of this movie is that the person was a victim originally and is killing everyone related to their attacker. Like a weird form of justice. Just like Batman they became what scared them most. Taking on the Ghostface persona and turning it back on their sight of revenge. Its an honor to meet Sid not because Ghostface wants her dead but because they idolize her. Sid has killed every original scream killer. Other than Roman. Dewey shot him in head. So in some twisted way they might think they're the same.  Jill even kind of set up the stalker vibe when she bitched about how annoying it was to be related to the ever so talked about Sidney. The killer is an obsessed super fan stalker of Sidney!
Nope
Why.
Scream is gonna go woke and go broke on this one bye scream franchise 1-3 were good say RIP in 2022
Look good ngl
My fav movie eveer!!!
Cool! I like scream, nits not too complicated with kills and i like that.
He better trip and fall
hollywood has run out of ideas. saving money by not hiring good, more expensive writers
Oh no not again
Here because of Jordan Cunningham.
Well it's about time.
Five bucks says Stu survived the first one and is the killer in this one.
What’s the MOTIVE?!?!
copying the halloween from 2018
The key to a horror movie is suspense and expectations(as in expecting the killer to be somewhere and he pops out from somewhere else)    Change my mind
It’s seriously time they finally kill Sydney off and the killer Survives! Tired of all these happy endings
i was born in the late 90’s and i can’t rlly remember the scream movies from back then but i’m so stoked the original cast is back. this movie FEELS iconic already omgg so many twists and turns. a new era of slasher movies i’m so ready 😌🔪
Hello, Syndney!
The kids AND the Loomis kid are red herrings... It's Dewey! It's gotta be! That would better than killing him or Sidney off... And Sidney will have to stop the most unsuspected Ghostface yet.. And as a third killer?? Yes! He has been too close by all this time and he always knows when to get Sidney stationed and isolated.. Her first attack at the house.. (Personally I think he was the one who chased her in the bathroom at school.. Not Billy..) Then showing up to Windsor and not catching on to Micky or Mrs. Loomis? Yeah okay... Scream 3 was all him too behind the scenes... Roman didn't do all that alone.. PERIOD.. Screa4m? Come on man! You let Ghostface stab Gail! And you knew she was gonna try and stop the killer that's why you had allowed them to do the Stabathon.. Bruuuuuuh you could've stopped it... Youuuuuu were the one Sidney saw and mistook for Cotton and Maureen's murder was how you became Deputy.. You was fuckin' on her too and shit got real so you plotted and staged her murder.. You always knew how to get Sidney and Gail alone... In every film! You left Tatum to get her neck caught in a fucking pet door.. 😳While the party was still on my Nigga! FOH!
I am excited for this one. No matter how many Screams come and go, I cannot get over Skeet Ulrich's sassiness from Scream 1. Neve is a legend and if anyone really was on par with her from these movies, it was Skeet as Billy!
The Scream Franchise will forever be my favorite. To have this come out in 8th grade and grow up with it, and watch this one last go round.... "ITS AN HONOR" LoL
1:40 wasn't he one of the killers from SREAM 2 ?
Wazzzuppp!!!!!!
I randomly started watching Scream clips after 20 years today and just thought “they could totally reboot”  Then the algorithm delivered.  Neve is a double-dime today
Now, they make ghost face movie
Please let the killer be Stu from the first movie
Ghost face looks cute
He sounds like pennywise with that opening quote
I wonder if this Ghostface is gonna be just as clumsy
Sydney returns to finish off Ghostface but the question is can she do it? Find out in theaters  Scream
I can't wait for the new Scary Movie now
I can't take these movies seriously
*So, Cydney is helping people in trouble after recovering from her dramatic past.* Nice
They need to stop...
i would like to play a game, how about smash?
Imagine randy and stu turn out to be alive I don’t really think anybody cares about this character but what happened to Judy hicks
You want Stu return?
Is that jenny Ortega
not again this fuckin shit
I’ll probably watch it once.
Finally gonna kill Dewey huh. Don’t think we didn’t see Gail screaming and getting pulled back. Only one thing can happen for her to have that reaction….
I’m just realising.... WE NEVER GOT STUS MOTIVE FROM THE FIRST ONE
That house at the beginning looks like Nancy's out of A nightmare On Elm Street!!! Maybe a small tribute to Wes Craven R.I.P
I hope they dont pull out a halloween kills ending bruh
After Micheal Myers, Ghostface return is dream come true for 90's kids
TRASH MOVIE
Finally we get to see Sydney as the killer!
They should just move to Watts LA and he will never visit them again
So fucking awesome.. classic mask and voice.. im so happy abt this
Dam I knew I should’ve bought that warzone skin
You cannot kill off a great movie franchise like this. Even after 25 years. 👍
Wow the originals are back
In the text messages it sounds like there may be a gathering where Amber is. Because Tara replies, a reason why she can’t go and she says “YOU should come over HERE”   So I think the party at Stus house will be the opening kill, amber and the other guy from love victor will die then Tara will be attacked. Just a hunch
Cant fcking wait
I see Dewey is finally going to be ghostface 👍👍
Hopefully Kirby makes an appearance in the end because her character was cool and she was hinted to come back in scream 5 as the lead girl in the past
Much better then that sh** 2015 series.  Finally get to see the face of silliness and serial fu**ery.
what would make this more scary is if we never find out who the killer is
calling it stu is the killer
stu is the killer
Damn nev Campbell didn’t age at all.  She even looks younger.
And Sidney die and pass the legacy so Samantha carpenter
So when does he smoke weed with the boys?
This new Scream movie might be darker than the previous scream movies...
😈😈😈
Liberal 🤡s Real Title 😴😴😴😴😴
But it can never replace the scary movie one... lol
Who else is exited?
Wazzzzzzaaaaaaaaaaaa...
I hope they bring Stu back as the killer, the original script for the second was that he survived but they changed it. It would be cool if Stu like escaped jail and went on a killing rampage to avenge Billy
The previous 4 movies were all sophisticated, twisted and with quite distinct ideas, and I tend to think a further distinction here is a group of Ghostfaces, 3/4 or more (as compared to 1/2 previously). And as in Scream 2 and 4 one of the Ghostfaces betrayed his partner (by killing the other), then here this group will have more complexity of interests, to start coliiding also with each other earlier in the movie, like before the 3rd act and perhaps while their identities are still a mystery. Maybe, just a thought.  What also triggered me to think this, are the lines: "Whoever THIS IS, HE IS..." and "Sidney, it's an honor" as a potential mislead to think about an intimate meeintg of 2 people, as if just 1 person who's out to kill and who's after Sidney.
Why would she open the door and why would she use the phone to unlock the doors? Unlocking them each of them one by one is way more convenient.
Wonder how much time Dewey spends  on his ‘Billy Loomis hairstyle’ Pinterest board.. he looks like he did a Loomis inspired haircut tutorial with a steak knife.
spoopy
Let's fucking go!!!
✨Jenna✨
Halloween, Upcoming Exorcist(1973)  Trilogy and scream !
Am I the only one who didn't like 4
This movie is coming on my birthday 🎉
if you remember in the first movie sydney and billy had sex......what if the killer in the 2022 version is the son of sydney/billy getting revenge for his father
is that there knife the buck 119 special?
lmao that acting is hilarious
Do you really want to see a guy dressed like a nun and 1 bullet away from dying killing people?😂😂😂
I’m so excited because my birthday is in January so I’m going to see this for my birthday
Are they running out of original movies ideas in Hollywood?
Childhood Fav Series ❤️
Tara: “This isn’t, Amber” Ghostface: “Would you like to play a game, Tara?”
I feel like dewy will actually die in this one like he has almost died too many times. And like I feel like it will be to save gale idk probably wrong but that's what I think
We know what’s favorite costume for next year
So I guess the argument is can the fact Hollywood is intellectually bankrupt actually produce a few gems here and there?  In this specific case, I certainly hope so.
When is it coming out
GOOD MOVIE ON ME
Last one was trash! This one will be trash! These movies can’t be taken seriously since scary movie came out!  Lol
Interesting... A new Scream movie is coming
WAZZZUUUPPPPPP
laurie strode and sidney should go get coffee sometime
Cannot take this seriously, after scary movie
OMG Just finished watching Scream 1-4 !Excited for this! Can't wait to see it!
DAISY DIASY GIVE ME YOUR ANSWER
waaazuuuuuuuuuuuupppppp
I’d love to see stew as the killer
Phone Call for Ghostface!
Bro how many of these remakes are they gonna fuckin make 🤣
hey everybody wazzzzzzzuuuuuupppppp
I have a theory that Sidney's mom is still alive and is the killer and somehow an unknown past member is not quite dead. I'm thinking either Randy or even Cotton.
This movie is bound to be a wokefest
I’m Just glad That in this new movie it’s the actual character (Sydney) trying to kill Ghost face. It rlly was disappointing how Jamie Lee Curtis didn’t kill Michael or even try to through the movie.
Took 5 movies.....I’m Sydney Prescott, of course I have a gun
As usual: basically showed us the entire thing. Don't give your money to this lol
I'm so excited. Scream was one of my favourite childhood movies. I even named my dog after Sidney.
i need dbd movie
It's probably Randy Meeks 🤣
It’s gonna be like Micheal Myers where the old people beat him up 😕
You guys really couldn’t have just called it “Scream 5?”
I agree with Dewey when he says something about this 1 feels different! I think its gonna be more serious with some awesome twists! Favorite part of the trailer was "I'm Sidney Prescott of coarse I have a gun"!
So the fourth sequel to the movie "Scream" is titled..."Scream"?  Not "Scream 5" or "Scream 2022" or "Scream: Ghostface Stabs Again".  Just "Scream."  Someone deserves to be stabbed for this decision.
This looks much better than Scream 4. Hopefully this makes a lot of money like the Halloween 2018 movie
Why is he killing all these people .. :/
They better be bringing back Stu that would be the biggest twist!
Dylan Minnette 😍😍😍
“Do you want to play a game?”  My horror movie educated people will know what that’s from
stu is  back also   .. pronounced dead  but  somehow  survived without  them knowing
why is this girl here? she's so annoying. This is going to be more annoying than a horror movie.
Can’t wait for my new movie!
If Scream and Halloween had a crossover and co-directed/co-produced by Wes Craven and John Carpenter I think it might be gold  Edit: (I wasn't aware that Mr. Craven died 6 years ago. Though if he was, it would have been great.)
Stuck in the middle deleted episode
using the same name as the original is dumb
2:06 “Hello, Sidney! It’s an honor”
"Hello sydney" sent chills down my fucking spine holy shittt👻🔪
Yawns
Super excited to see this new EPIC! I have a feeling this is going to jump start a new era for this series! 😃
I just wanna appreciate tha bringing back of the original cast
its time to new "scary movie" movie
ok Im excited!
It’s a scream baby!!
When she said in 1:41 , the attacks were all on people related to the original killers makes me think , this killer is doing this because he/she is a fan of the ghost face killers or is a fan of Sydney or it’s someone getting revenge for one of the previous killers maybe someone from Stu’s family
W A Z Z A P
To make our day, full of stupid teenagers from nowdays, awesome. Hopefully the trailer didnt give everything
Hi, Cindy......NO, I mean Sidney.
Is there any real killers watching this trailed now?
今度の犯人は女と見た！
Idk how I feel about the house being hacked
My god when are they going to stop this shit like try making new horror characters and build movies like let the past ones go please like I don’t care for this at all
That’s the Myers house 1:36
plizz game scream game ps5 2022
Halloween, scream, jeepers creepers, chucky, its time for an horror year
We all know who the real killer is in this movie the MPAA who ironically enjoy butchering any graphic death scenes
WAZAAAAAAAA!!!
What's my favorite scary movie? The first Scream movie is my favorite. Although I sure can't wait to see this. Ghostface is back. Awesome.
I think the killer is Stu. Who else thinks so?
The main questoin is why is he killing them??
This is the fifth sequel of the Scream franchise since Wes Craven passed away.
It’s the same movie as Halloween 🤣🤣🤣
I've watched this trailer 40x & that "It's an Honor" line still gives me goosebumps‼️😱😁❤️‍🔥
I can’t wait, it’s been so long since the last Scream movie
Nice, they made a movie about the warzone operator 😂😂
I love the Scream movies I remember going to see the original first Scream movie back in 1996 i was just 15 years old that was my very first experience going to the movies theatres to see my very first scary movie & that was the very first scream movie & it turn out to be truly awesome & now I'm 40 years old i have the complete scream movie collection on dvd includes all 4 movies + a bonus disc with very awesome brand new extra features including a very cool spacial featurette of the original srceam cast & crew reunion celebrating the 25th anniversary with new interviews & A Rare Behind The Scenes Footage At The Making Of The Original First Scream Movie On Location With Director The Late Wes Craven very awesome i always tell my friends & my family specially my sister she is so crazy & loves those movies she is a huge fan of David Arquette she is crazy in love with him my sister is the real reason that i myself got in to loving these srceam movies & i love that neve Campbell very time i watch theses srceam movies with her she is always very lovely to see the srceam movies are truly awesome to buy a copy of the complete srceam dvd set it is worth it i personally guarantee i can't wait to see ghost face once again what's your favorite scary movie? 👍 👍
good to see Hollywood as some nice fresh ideas :)
im sorry but this doesn't look scary at all. I mean ole Ghost face doesn't give me the willies like he did when i was a kid in the 90's/early 2000s.
I plan on watching this movie in theaters because of Jenna Ortega, and I don't give a single crap on how scary it is. 😳
Is this the rob zombie version?
I don’t like horror movies because they are boring but I’ll watch this for sure
This is finally where dooie  reveals himself of being ghost face the whole time l9l
Waiting to get scream operator in cod mobile.
iscream
Let's hope it's a better reboot then the recent Halloween  movie cos that sucked. .
Young valorant players:   I didnt know scream as like that.
Its an honor ok I see someone graduating her surviving all movie's bet its an old Ghostface that returned
Why does this movie have the same name as the original
I say it’s Billy’s love child
Honestly nothing will ever replace the original. Drew berrymore rocks ❤️❤️❤️
After Halloween (1978) ,the 1st Scream is the best slasher movie
Wont be surprised if another copycat pops up in the next few years.
Sydney will be gutted like a fish this time!
Is it just me or I feel like dewey and gale have gone through divorce, it seemed like dewey is living alone.
Is it just me or I feel like dewey and gale have gone through divorce, it seemed like dewey is living alone.
Yes! Very N🧊, I’d even consider saying that this is bodacious, radical even. 🥸👍 I approve.
I wonder if Billy or Stu unknowingly got some girl pregnant and now their child is out there killing.
Finally slasher movies are starting to come back I was getting tired of all this ghost/demon crap every year.
Woah the movie scream is gonna happen in 2022 that's cool I'm so excited
I can't wait. That cast is back.
What’s more scary is that she has a landline in 2021. 🙄
Really had to show half the movie in the trailer tho huh? Here’s hoping it’s as smart and well written as the first one.
Does the new generation know about the other 4 movies before this one 👀
I really hope the killer is stu somehow.
I love the dudes voice
Paramount pictures is the best
Honestly this is more horrifying than all the other scream movies because they were mostly just Ghostface tripping and being hurt by people just throwing random shot at him but this trailer looks more serious than the other trailers and movies
i have to be honest i really wasnt looking forward to this movie when i first watched the trailer but after watching the original again and thinking about it more, i think i see what theyre going for with this entry. Its still a meta commentary on horror movies (specifically halloween 2018), but its much more hidden this time around. I can see a lot of references to newer horror movies in terms of the visuals and of course the movie hasnt come out yet so who knows what will happen or if the horror references from the original trilogy will be a big factor, but i think theyre going for a more subtle approach to updating the series for a new generation, the biggest example being with the title itself. at first i was mad that this new entry was just called scream but the more i thought about it, the more i realized its probably an intentional reference to halloween 2018, texas chainsaw, all of those new horror movies that have similar or the exact same titles as the movies that theyre sequels to. im still on the fence a bit, but im looking forward to watching it now, im excited to see if any more old faces will return or if this will be the definitive end to the series (likely not tho, in the word of matthew lillard, LETS FACE IT BABY, THESE DAYS  YOU GOTTA HAVE TO HAVE A SEQUEL)
As a long standing fan of scream 1, 2 and 4. I'm hyped af seeing original cast
feeling &!
Even the trailer says it is going to be a homage film. The "killer" will likely be her child, a fan, a relative of a close victim, or dare i say it, the child of the original bastards from the 1st movie, Stew and that one dude who also died, because they both were pass off characters with equally pass off traits.
I dare ask what Hollywood will do when all of these people are and I mean no disrespect to Ms. Curtis when I say they are her age and they  are still attempting franchise reboots? Even attaching a year to to the remake will be redundant when it's been remade, reimagined, rebooted, or remixed so much that is becomes just another random movie with a random number associated
YO THIS COMES OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY
I hope stu is in it
I’m wearing a scream shirt now
0:49 got to be honest this scene right here is gold👌🏽
Lmao 10 days before my birthday
why just Scream?! why not Scream 5, or Scream: New Slash or something?  Stop using the same names so people will land on your movie rather than the "old" one. same BS as Ghostbusters (2019) and Fast and Furious (2009)
will it have time travel like "STAB 5"
I watched till 0:40 because I'm afraid of seeing too much of this movie. I'll watch it next Halloween.
pls upload the whole movies of scream on netflix pls
First Halloween now Scream. Can't wait for a Friday the 13th now that the lawsuit bullshit is over. Hope this and any other movies deliver!
Did anyone notice that the mask looks different each time the killer is shown in the trailer. So definitely looks like multiple killers may be appearing
These movies are so stupid lol
Finally new scream movie
Dewy looks like he's on his way out, Scream 1 & 2  were the best, imo, They cast all these no name actors, then u never see most of  them again, I just want to know who the killer is!
I love chostfase
Finally a new scream movie!
shaggy here we come
The beast is back hopefully he doesn’t fall over all the time like old times
Seems like Scream lost it's sense of humour to me. Way too serious.
Even though I felt like I watched the whole movie in this trailer, (NEVE CAMPBELL) look BEAUTIFUL & Facial muscles, are gorgeous! She’s been working out for this movie… #Scream5 #GhostFaceIsBACK
Thriller crossover between friends, the boys and the 13 reasons why 😂👐👐
Definitely looking forward to this
This is gonna be great cant wait🔥🔥 ''its an Honor’’
Still kinda sad Hayden Panettiere wasnt casted as Kirby again :(
It comes out on my bithday ahhaha
This JANuary it’s time to Micheal Down your Vincent’s.
This is crazy! I remember watching a movie on the 90s with the exact same name.
I just watched "Scream" for the first time a couple nights ago, and it was such an enjoyable experience - can't wait to finish the sequels that are out now. Ghostface has been the face of Halloween for me since I was a kid, and now that I'm invested I can't wait for this movie 😍
Fuck this man i’ma have nightmares all over again
Why do people keep making these boring remake with almost different storyline 🙄
What's the most terrifying thing about Ghostface in a modern setting, is that he calls before attacking.  Think about it, before he could start his rampage only in places with landlines, nowadays he can start anywhere, any time.
another one
Scream 1 Her BF, Scream 2 Her BF's Mother, Scream 3 Her Brother, Scream 4 Her Cousin!!! Scream 5 Its her fucking golden retriever from Scream 3 I AM TELLING Y'ALL!!! 2:02 Dewie Or Sidney Is DEFFO DEAD!!!
Yeah! Ghostface is back 🤩👏🏻
At least Ghostface is wearing a mask, I don't want to catch Covid before I get stabbed to death. I take all the risk.
They have my boy Clay Jensen in the movie!
I hope it’s actually scary unlike the other movies
It will Stu who plead insanity and is now “cured” and out and a younger accomplice,  hence one saying “Hey Sydney” on the phone in a higher pitched voice Andrew younger one saying, “ITS AND HONOR👹👹👹” in a natural scary voice ooooo spooky
The phone saying “door unlocked” ruined the scene. Broke the atmosphere, modern horror movies always have this sci-fi voice from the phones telling us what’s happening.
So cool, I wonder who the killer could be?
might not be the same without wes craven
IF STU ISN’T BACK I DONT WANT IT
Idk it just feels wrong that it’s coming out in January
Who has a landline anymore 😂
0:51 and 1:14  Ghost face is at least 6ft tall and not that buff. Im guessing Jack Quaid..1:33 Ghost face is much shorter...At least 2 killers
Gosh the scary movie changed how I look at the scream franchise I was waiting for the funny part in the trailer but realized later that this is an original scream movie lmao
Bruh, imagine what Scream 2042 is gonna be like lol
Really was wanting to hear, what’s your favorite scary movie!
It looks good I’m ready to see it
i guess i should watch the original scream                                         again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Scream Kills
omg
I'm Sydney Prescott of course I have a gun. Love it.
So he has to be close for all the victims to be related to The Killers, while at the same time also close to Sydney because her niece was the last killer. Is anyone for sure Sydney's mom is dead????? Plot twist from hell right there!!!
Ive been a fan of SCREAM for years this one is definitely going to be a good one
I definitely don’t think Stu died. Heard nothing else about him. He probably played it off as if Billy tried to kill him too. This ghost face.. sounds aged..
This is not scary, wwwaaazzaaa up
Ghostface is a H@ckz0r apparently. exploiting downsides of Smart Homes lol
final cut spoilers below:     Ghost face sets a trap for Judy hicks to come to the house thinking her son is in danger but she ends up getting a bit bloody in daylight  Doesn’t end well for Dewey at the hospital trying to be the hero  Amber is the one set on fire by Sidney  One of the characters is the daughter of billy loomis  Gale is separated from Dewey and returns from LA  Sidney is married  Mindy died in the original cut but the reshoots were due to test audiences liking her too much for her to die so the ending was reshot  2 killers (1 male 1 female)
Ah so a discord mod hacker is scream for this movie. Ok
when the movie looks really good but you have to wait a while for it
Why would you open the door?! I know stupid people are a staple in horror movies but come on!
Doofy is back 🤣🤣
Haydi başlayalım.. hello Sydney
I cant believe🤣🤣🤣🤣 scream is on again
Why did she open the door, just to get stabbed, bruh.
If you see Sam for the first Time just when she meets Sidney  she seems to be pushing a something at the hospital it must be a wheelchair surely it's Tara
Cant wait
wooooooooooooooooooowwowwowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
You poor thing…😏
The doors unlocking locking brilliant lol they should've left that tagged teamed oh alone lol.
Wow
This is my favorite horror at all times and I'm not afraid. Plus im more excited to see my favorite character and act Sidney/Neve back
What is your favorite scary movie?
everyone has been wanting me to watch the trailer! and i'm out lol
The killer will be RANDY!!! if you watched his reaction to the video you’ll know why, and if you know your research on the character and realize that they weren’t planning on writing his character off anyways, then you’ll understand.
Mannmpnwbons  Hangsnob
A more serious ghostface im watching it
If the killer has connections with the people who died in the first movie, Gale is going to die. I mean, Gale's cameraman Kenny was killed because of her.
Let’s just hope the don’t fuck it up like they did Halloween kills smh 🤦🏾‍♀️ the only good thing about that one was the killing the story line was trash. I was so disappointed
The killer probably has connections with Casey Becker or Cotton Weary.
Awwww shit, here we go again.
No offense to the fans of the genre, but I always felt like to me, Scream is a bit basic and generic. Nothing scary, just different killing scenes.
I can't wait.
Looks great but the big twist will just be that it's a woman killing. As if anyone would be shocked  that a woman would be willing to kill a man. Go ahead and load the dishwasher wrong see if your wife doesn't come close to stabbing you.
You're showing too much for me. Now we Know who is not the killer
Hello Cindy! It's an honor!
Haha I have to stop reading the comments
scream ist doch die lachnummer seit scary movie finde ich .
“Hellllooooo Sidney!!!”💀.  Hahaha my child hood most watched movie 🎥 🍿
It shoud've been Scary movie...
I am so tired of this ! Why do directors name "murder mystery" films as horror.....this is not a horror film at alll
What we all wanted to do to that selfish neighbor who doesn't share the wifi pass.
I really like the idea of a ghostface that for once doesn't care about sidney
pls don't kill Syd, Gale or Dewey, they've been with me for over 15 years now and I care for them so much!! /bites fingernails
nah i cant take this series seriously ever since scary movie came out ive never been able to take scream seriously lmao
🥲
That yellow jacket guy should be the killer🤣
WHAAASAAAA UUUUUUP
scream: "new year, new me."
1:56 back to the og house Im so hyped this franchise is apart of my childhood
Love how they making games and movies from my childhood because zoomers hove no thought process
Hi
Can't wait I'm excited looks good this scream feels different better but not better than the original
And at 1:18 peep the way jack (richie) stares at Sam. Subtle details in these movies are key. Thank me later.
IF YOU PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE TRAILER YOU CAN SEE A BLOOD COVERED SAM STABBING JACK INSIDE OF STU’s HOUSE AT 2:02 IN WHAT LOOKS LIKE THE FINALE.  AMBER AND JACK ARE BOTH SEEN BEING TAKEN DOWN IN THE TRAILER
The pink shirt girl was in YOU too. Ellie!
Its same script. Throw out people who look so suspicious then ending its some idiot that got abuse by his dog when he was little.
Horror movies releasing in winter time know what's up 👌
Notice how Stu's house is there
Dewy is like oh shit not this again lol
so you run to the front door and open it…
yes but why january
Guess paramount bought it from dimension, cuz the vibe is very modernized idk if I'm gonna like but definitely gonna add to the collection
More Botox the better I always say…
They are using the same party house from the first scream
can’t wait and the fact it’s only 2 months away makes it so more exciting !!!!
Anyone wanna take bets that Stu is the killer and he's not dead
"Something about this one just feels different"... but of course, after wearing the coveralls for 40 years, MICHAEL MYERS decided to change to a more fashionable attire...
WAZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
Why haven't these people learned that if Sidney Prescott shows up in your city to run for your fuckin life!!!😂
*WAZZZUPPPPPPPPPP*
Very super nice 👍🏻👻🔪🩸😱!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
😐
🎃
Ghostface, yep its on
This looks fucking awful
Wow. Nice comeback ..cant wait this movie!
fuck this  boycott this shit  they stole the rights from wayan brothers  now they want to erase there legacy with re releasing it  as usual the evil works its legal magic
Hope it turns out to be better than the last one. I like the Scream franchise.
me tryna find out the killer through the trailer
So There's Another Scream Coming Out Let's Keep The Trends Going Do You Like Scary 🎥🍿🥃
Please let Stu be the killer could you imagine the reveal of Matthew Lillard that would be insane
Damn, Neve is still fine as ever.🤗
Another rebooth of original cast coming back and older..not a fan of this concept
Is it me or who thinks that Stu comes back alive and is ghost face this time?
I can’t take this for serious since I saw scary movie😂
is this movie or series?
Is no one bothered by the fact That the movie is coming out in 2022 and they still have house phones. No one has house phones any more
Thank you for sending me that I thought ghost face was going to stop just like Friday the 13th
Scream being one of my favorites alongside how 'Scary Movie' made him less frightening, I can honestly say that I'm excited asf for this one. The classic "who" question looks to be back in play 🙈
Tacklerweenz!!
I can't express *how excited i am for this movie.* It's not just the fact that my favourite horror movie franchise is making another movie with the *same actors* as all the other films, but it's also the fact that it looks *GREAT.* 🔥🔥🔥
Last rule of a horror movie, always go back to the beginning - Randy  I think we gonna be getting two Ghostfaces, Stu being one & the other being a twist for sure
Tbh I did not think this will be scary
Man last scream was far better than this so funny and good
The killer has to be stu just to be honest
i love scream 5
Sam's boyfriend (Jack Quiad) is a sus, the outfit that he is wearing is an outfit that Billy Loomis wearing in the original. Also Wes Hicks has that same outfit with Stu.
I watched scream in 96 and fell in love with the series. Its campy and cheesy at times, but its a cult classic.
OMFG soon as I heard "would you like to play a game" I got chills that voice is an upped version of the old one and it's amazing and super creepy.
When the phone rings the first thing I think of is WHAAAAATS UUUUUUUUP
When is it coming out
Wowww
Nice
It's a remake from Scream.. estimate is 2killers in ghostface, buddies tag team killer.. Could be Sidney's relatives (if based from Scream 4 the cousin is the killer as it's a remake)..  About Halloween kills, is nice that the production crew honor Friday the 13th (part where Michael Myers appear at the doorway from the burning house, it feels like Jason Voorhees was there). The killing and gore has the Jason Voorhees feel.
Hey Sidney :)
I really like the trailer soundtrack. Does it have a name?
I know that this gonna be good but I can't take this seriosly since I saw Scary Movie 1
After watching scary movie, I can't stop laughing whenever I watch Scream lol
Release date
Here's hoping this movie will acknowledge how creepy Dewey's feelings for Sidney are.  Gail deserves better.
"Hello, Sidney. It's an honor."  "You flatter me. And if you're truly honored to meet me, then you know that I've put down five other Ghostfaces, right? Would you like a moment to reconsider?"
I love this
I am waiting for the parody called Scary movie that Wayans brothers will make from this.... 😂😂
I wish another scary movie to be on this one 😂
Woodsboro is a town, THE TOWN, that is widely known for its infamous murders. New, fresh, young faces take residence there. Old friends, longstanding survivors of these events, on the other hand, need no introduction. But, even after a quarter century, an unknown killer is the loose, donning the costume and mask, using the all-too-familiar, frightening voice!!!!  So who's gonna be next THIS time?😧🗡
I remember seeing the original in the movie theatre in ‘97 and it shook up the whole audience in the theatre! Wish i could go back to that time! Really do! But it was great!..This was a long time coming! 2022 will be the 25th anniversary of the movie!
It’s Stu; Because They Never Showed Him Really Dead On The Floor Of Part 1…🤷🏽‍♀️Ijs
Scream has been one of my favs since a kid 😁😇
please let jason surface again come on like seriously
Pffff.
Oh my god  It’s Dewey and Sidney 😮
If it is stu i beg that on his reveal he delivers the famous line " Surprise Sidney"
Damm clay Jensen can’t catch a break from people’s drama
After watching Scary movie I don’t know if I can take scream seriously  any more 😂
Hmm... Not impressed.
Either one of the scream 1 veterans are gonna be the killers or one is gonna die
GIRLS ITS HALLOWEEN BABE!! 😉🤡🎃👻
Guys, I haven't even watched that movie and I bet I know who is the fifth killer, but I can't tell you
This ghostface looks badass and not as clumsy   Hoping he really is stronger then the others
MY BOY IS BACK
Sidney Prescott gave this a thumbs down 2.5 k times........
It better be stu If its not stu I'm done
Boy I can’t WAIT
This new trend in horror movies is to give the characters guns to try and shush the people going "Man if they just had a gun" but they always end up having to of course force it out of the scene somehow and come up with excuses why that wouldn't work and it always comes off as dumb as hell; would be better if they just didn't have guns at all...
I Can’t Fucken wait any longer!!
1:32 lmao did you see how he was chasing him
Ghost face:  I’m to old for the shit
Shitttt! This is scary. So excited..
Everyone in 2021: Who calls through house phones nowadays?  Scream: Hold my knife !
Do I need to watch the other films before I watch this ???
I bet its Dylan Minette along with someone else. His name in it is Wes Hicks apparently. And I was looking for clues like how Billy Loomis had a name referencing Psycho and Halloween. And anyway Wes Hicks is a kind of anagram for H Sew Sick. He's so sick...lol I donno just spitballing. Its def a dumb stretch but maybe I'm onto somethin.  Edit: Also. Right after it says "this is" of the line "whoever this is", it lands on Dylan, when they're all sitting around the table.
Not yall saying this looks good it looks terrible
This seems darker already
This coming out on my birthday haha
“Dis sum good shit bra”-Ghost Face
The better make a Scary movie 2022
Is this gonna be apart of the Netflix series or just a normal movie
Sydney is the only one I care about. Aim for the head, Sydney!
“Hello, we wanted to reach you on your car’s extended warranty!
WHY DO PPL USE THE FRONT DOOR THEY KNOW THE KILLER IS THERE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Ghostface: What's your favorite Scary Movie Why'd you hang up on me Do you want to die tonight I will gut you like a fish
I cant wait for this to come out, I’m definitely going to see it when it comes out!!
The digital age ghostface who can hack door and stuff.
man im fucking stoned -ghostface
looks pretty frickin cool
Sheeeeeeeeeeeit
I feeling a little whoozey here man
SO EXCITED
I don't know anything about who playing who I want this to be a surprise. My theory Why am I feel like Jack Quaid is playing Stu's secret son? They look alike. My theory is Stu had a kid with someone around the first killings. Also maybe Dylan Minette is the second killer he could pass for Gale's and Dewey's son . I hope I'm wrong but giving their popularities it's a typical move to make them a killer or the hero of the story
Special officer Doofy, reporting for duty!
Yeeessss!!!! Takes me back to the 9th grade! 25 years ago the first movie dropped and it was AWESOME!!!!
This is gonna be awesome
I think that this, instead of a parody of slashers, like the original scream, I think this is a parody of modern horror "comebacks" like alien covenant, skulls, and of course, the 2018 halloween. Think about it, this whole trailer could be leading us on.
Spread the gospel please!
LET'S Goooooo
Everyone in the comment not talking about stues house
There where rumors about Stu surviving if he did this would play out perfect but chances are low😕
Pause at 2:01 RIP Dewey. https://youtu.be/beToTslH17s?t=121
This is scary
Scary movie 2023 Cindy vs scream Endgame
Scream ain’t playin no more😭
Call of Duty launched the movie in their game before it released XD
Watch it be randy. Or did he die? Idk I only saw scream 1
i was just wondering when the next one would come out
Please kill him somebody before he kill somebody
¿Does anybody think that there are more Ghostface killers in this movie like 3 of them ?😱😱😱
I'm not a fan of Scream, but i wait so much to watch this movie. It's so exciting!!!
Looks good, shame they've re-cast Courtny Cox with Caitlyn Jenner though...
this looks ass but im still gonna watch it
Is it shown on TV?
Nev Campbell never got big roles outside this franchise. I never understood that. She still looks 🔥 too
I can't take this seriously after watching scary movie
i hope its stu
I just got to say wazzzzaaaaaaaaaaa
Better than Halloween kills just saying
NOOÒOOOOOOOO
Not sure that I really like it, but that "it's an honor" line was perfect
Yas
Actually looks pretty faithful
Wazzzzzzzahhhhh 😂
Movie cool and all... BUT IS THAT BIONICPIG
WAZZUPPPPP
1:03: best line!  I wish Elisha Cuthbert had been in this movie...
0:25 For once, they're actually at the fucking door lmfao
Hope there is no wokeness..
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
I can't wait I haven't been this hyped for a movie in a long time 🤘
Damn this looks like it's gonna be good!!
I LOVE THAT DYLAN MINUETTE IS IN THIS!!!
Imagine your little brother walks up to you and goes "Ghostface from Warzone!" 😂
So funny film
all i'm here for is to see how much furniture this man trips over
The shot at 2:05 was just 😍
this some mobile game ad shit💀
I'm tired of scream. Always the same shit. Im more interested in Halloween (which again is usually always the same shit).   But scream is such a terrible slasher that they can't even release their movie on Halloween
Scream 5 been waiting for this
Chucky or Jason
did i peep clay jenson? whatever his real name is
What if this intro is just a reboot of Stab.... Since we doing reboots now.
My Halloween costume is ghost face but devil ghost face
DAMN! Michael and Ghostface?!
Stop bringing the old people back, start fresh unless you’re lee Curtis stop.
It’s so funny watching Scream movies now, after watching Scary Movie 1 all of those years ago I can’t find Ghostface scary anymore 😂😂
A reboot REALLY?  it's going to suck.
Who else noticed that the bottom of the mask at the end of the teaser forms a V?
So it won’t be released to DVD or Blu-Ray?
Why do they feel like the Scooby Doo gang?
OMG THEY BROUGHT THE GOAT
Top 10 must watch movies this Halloween https://youtu.be/WVN01uII6co
Kinda hyped, but I wish the trailer showed more of the new characters
LOOKS GREAT ....HOWEVER .....ITS ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE....THIS COULD BE MORE OF THE SAME......BUT I LOVE THE FRANCHISE !!!   I HOPE ITS BRILLIANT .
😇😂
😂
Jenna Ortega’s acting is so good ❤️
Radio Silence directed this, the guys who made “Southbound”.
"This isn't Amber" Ok, ok, but theory, what if it is?
Ayo he’s kind of hot
im protesting in public!
That's the girl from stuck in the middle
Is this January 14th 2022
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
white people choices lmfao
Ghostface = the most underrated villain Scream movies = the most underrated slasher films Sidney = the most underrated final girl  I always found Ghostface the most terrifying. Super fast, makes sure you’re sh*t scared first and gives you the most gruesome and painful death!
Let's goooooooo.....Super super hyped
This right here.
Every part has the same plot and at the same time different and I'm glad that they didn't change that, because that's what makes it iconic.
I dont know why but ive always liked scream more than the other horror movies. Probably just pier pressure though
Vai ser bom o filme
It's just a regular guy tho, who cares
This and Halloween have my excited as hell
GIRLS WHAT U DOING FOR HALLOWEEN BABE? 😉🎃👻
I think Jason is the strongest, Freddy is the evilest, Michael is the toughest, Ghostface is the stealthiest and quietest, and leather face is just the guy who fights anyone who approaches him.
I can’t take that movie seriously anymore. Ever since I watched scary movie it’s been hard for me to take the scream movies seriously anymore
I'm thinking Jack Quaid might be the killer
My childhood crush  🥴🥴
No thanks...
Yea the killer is way taller then before
CALLING IT NOW STU MACHER LIVES!
Can Hollywood not come up with something original? I saw they are making a new Pet Sematary too.
I'm Sydney Prescott of course I have a Gun
1:56 looks like stu’s house from the first film?
Wes craven movies are the shit the Screams really stood out every time they hit the theaters. Scream 5. nice
the first movie was the real deal. tired of these fresh remakes..
i love they are bring the moves back like this and having some of  the originals  actors  have a part in it brings to old and new  generation's of fans tougher
Im Fucking Sidney Presscut of course I have a gun....... Hell yessss
Yall overhyping this so much.
spoiler alert...the killer(s) are classmates.  - yours truly, class of '99
I love how all of these horror movies are coming out AFTER Halloween. Like, what's the point? Just release it NOW in October. At least we got Antlers and Halloween
Im sooo watching that. 1st thing in my bucket list.
Bet its The original cast thats the murderes
Hyyyyyped!
GhosT FaCE IS BACK IN BLACK BABY
Sydney better be ghost face
Does that mean we’re finally gonna get a Scary Movie sequel?!
Please don’t let it be like Halloween kills
Wish Ghostface would grab me from behind like that.
I reckon the blonde police women from the fourth film will end up being some sort of relation to Billy or Stew.
Modern horror has let me down a lot in the last decade+. This, though? This is something I can get behind.
I wish it was comedy
YAY
Let’s not forget at 49 minutes exactly in Scream 4: Rory Culkin (Charlie Walker) says: “And let me just say to our guest, Sidney Prescott, it’s an honor.” Does that tie in to Scream 2022 - when the killer says “Hello Sidney, it’s an honor”? Let’s find out. Maybe Charlie is Stu’s kid? I think Judy might have two sons. Either to Randy or Stu (maybe even Billy). And one of them is a murderer. Can’t wait for January!
What they take off the ghost face mask and its just another ghost face mask
The 1996 one is one of my all time favorite movies, so much that I haven’t watched any of the others but this one intrigues me
I hate his voice though... the original is better
Its Stu's Kid probably or Billys kid!!!
Man the first scream I just feel her boyfriend was a perfect ghost face I wish they would have him back as ghost face I guess next hollowen will hit different with all the ghost faces
Scariest movie I've watched is hunger games. My friend just invited me to watch this-
this type of movies not for today...born in 80an,i love sooo much slasher movie but now iam think kind of dumb...a man wearing a blanket and mask runnning chasing..a dumb sheriff and a girl never learn...get a call and cry..running screaming
Can't wait, Ghostface is a Legend 💯💯👍🏽👍🏽👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾!!!
Hilarious how all the "teens" are literally 25-30 years old
Very good acting harley, the screams after you got cut really sealed the deal. For real though that was pretty good  Oh this gonna be good, Clay Jensen in this shit
Jigsaw react : hahahhahaahhaa
I’m calling it right now Jenna Ortega is the killer and so is Jack Quaid or Dylan. I realize Jenna’s character “dies” in the trailer but let’s be real here; it could be fake footage or as the director says “tip of the iceberg of misinformation”
I would have been scared if they didn't have Neve Campbell in this.
If they're planning to make 3 movies again, I have a bad feeling they are gonna off the original trio! :S
He said “hello Sydney it’s an honor” that was chilling
Ooohhh shit in the car light scene did scream just kill off Morgan Wallen 😬 looks just like him
Bro when I heard when scream said do you want to play a game I thought this was a new saw movie lol
This is an icon. A legend.  Please don't fuck it up🔪🔪
Why did they change the Ghostface robe ???
I can’t take him serious anymore
Ohhhhh, can't wait to see it.do you like scary movies?
I'd see this before the new Halloween honestly
January release big OOF
If they added a little comedy to this like in the scene where the doors kept locking and unlocking and then host face said “just open the FUCKING DOOR”! That would be golden
I don't know... Something about this Ghostface just seems way more darker and much more terrifying than the other Ghostfaces  in the franchise. I mean obviously all the Ghostfaces are dark and terrifying but this one just feels different.  I don't know...
IM SO EXCITED
Wusss aaaaab
Monica
Is it me or did I see that there going back to Stu's house from the first scream? In Where they had that party in the end.
LONG LIVE WES CRAVEN
1:32 bro did a dead by daylight injured run
I said to someone at work today 'Have you watched the new Scream trailer' & they replied 'I have never watched any of them'.  I walked away and quit my job.
Praying for Stu.
SIDNEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Kp wie man den Film feiern kann... ist doch jedesmal genau das gleiche ^^ xD
WAZZUPPP
R.I.P. Dewey
wazzzzup
Seems like the new Halloween movie with the all the old characters having to come back together.. just saying
Interesting that Dewey says attacks and not murders
I wonder if they thought of calling it 5cream?
This movie should be an Honor of Wes Craven 😎👌🎬
hello, sidney
JUST KEEP THEM COMING!!!!! WE NEED NEVER ENDING SCREAMSSSSSS!!!!!!
this looks SO lame. They move wayyy to quick in trailers and movies nowadays ( phone rings - answer door, stabbed- all within the first 15 seconds lol). This has all been done before. Need to use more subtleties and hints and let the viewers mind fill in the rest.  The mind will always make up something way scarier than anything you could ever put on the screen. Can you guys put a little more effort into it the next time? jeezz....
Our horror movie genre is coming back since the 90s and from our childhood
It just gave me a smile. Scream was my first Hollywood slasher and one of my favorite movies when i was a kid. cant wait for the release
1.22 seconds. It’s the tinkerer from spider man miles morales
Damnit I hope Dewey was an accomplice all along or Stus alive.. otherwise this is just another forgettable sequel
Ohh FFS! 😂 Original cast in a remake 😂😂 I haven't been scared if these movies since Scary Movie came out 😂😂😂
There's a little of a Saw feeling about this one. Also sort of that badass "I've been through this before, I can help you through this" thing with Sidney in this. Kind of like Ripley in the later Alien films, Jamie Lee Curtis in the new Halloween films and Sarah John Connor in T2
Soo cool
STU`S REVENGE!! MAKE IT HAPPEN!!
so the ghostfaces from other movies were sydneys boyfriend and his friend the next was the boyfriends mother the next was sydneys brother i wonder who this ghostface will be
I am so excited. I was reallllllly worried. Hope it does Wes Craven proud. ♡♡♡
Wow this is actually happening?
Looks okay I like the others better tho
Excited raaaaaa 💀
That killer is fuckin funny
Halloween and scream are the 2 movies I'm waiting for 🔥
Just watching this trailer and I'm guessing before I see it, that Dewy dies in this one.
Beating the d o n k e y for 15 years.  4 movies and mtv TV series. Does anyone actually want this? 🤔 🤪🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Wow.big fan of the franchise and the cast.
Halloween kills sucked although the trailer was sick so I have some trust issues
😩👻
cant wait
The other ones are always funny ones and I’m ready for a killer on
Bro sydney will never catch a break 😂😂
Why would you open the door.
1:08 yeah yeah anything to get people to watch the 5th instalment because yous can't think any better stories to pitch
Smh Dewey is finally gon get got
I’m guess that the killer is Dylan minnette
Now we need scary movie remake to go alongside this.
Feels kinda weird for a Scream movie that wasn't directed by Wes but I'm excited, so ready to get stabbed. 💀🔪
this looks so fucking good
Wazzzzuuuup!!!!!!
Slashers are making a comeback
Ghostface will always be my favorite slasher
Let's be honest , even though stu and billy were the OG killers of one, they also are the most cringey killers and the most easily guessed killers of all the killer reveal, jill and mrs. Loomis in the other hand are the hard to guess
ITS DEWEY!
I hope it's worth it. Courtney Cox needs to stop with the botox and whatever else she does to her face.
Neve Campbell has aged beautifully.
My favorite movie I've been waiting to see. 🥰
so ready for this!!! so excited to watch it and be scared again!
No chance it will be Stu. It will end up being some one related to Billy. The line 'Its an honour' is meant in a way of 'its an honour I'm able to kill you'.
ah shit, here we go again
wazzzzzuuuuuppp
I’m here for it but why does she open the door at all? Scream set ups are brilliant because they’re logistically tight scenarios. That threw me off b/c she was already scared. Anyyyyyway, will def check it out!
Looks dumb seen it
Wazaaaaaaaa
Is this going back to Stu’s house?
Courtney cocks is back!!
Let's be real though, if Stu doesn't come back as the killer it's def gonna be Dylan (forget the characters name) right? Unless they pull some "he is the brother of Stu shinanigans
JENNA ORTEGA?
She’s from that terriable kids movie yes day
It’s a January horror movie which means there’s a high probability it will flop
This remake looks really good. Definitely seems more for the horror/gore and less comedy. The doors locking/unlocking was scary but she should’ve known the person woulda got in by now instead of slowly walking backwards.
YYYYEEESSSSS
This whole time I thought her name was "cindy" but it's Sidney
Doc Ock: “Hello, Peter.” Ghostface: “Hello, Sydney.” Honestly, these types of quotes feel so iconic…
Damn, this was terrifying!, Cool though!
Im love Scream
I'm Super excited for this movie 💕 90's slasher film
Holy crap it's the guy from warzone
Wow both Neve and Courtney Cox look terrible, but especially Courtney. How can she even go out in public like that. Wow.
Please, let it not be another "half sibling plot" again.
Damn, Scary movie 6 looks like it's going to be hilarious
if the killer isn't stu-
I love the look of this, but I would have loved it even more if they kept the trailer close to the beat of the original trailer, not with the voiceover preset but they kind of revealed who is gonna get attacked and some of the jump scares, in the original they kind of managed to keep that on the down low, hopefully they can make up for it with a lot more gore or psych horror in the movie itself :))
Wowww, nice! Brazil here.
I think its stu or the guy from 13 reasons why
They need to kill of the old cast
better 2 Release on 31st holloween
I CANT WAIT. THE FACT THAT THEY VISIT STU’S HOUSE. I LOVE SCREAM
I can't wait to figure out who's behind this mask
Does this mean there's gonna be a new scary movie but I really like scream
I love this ghostface voice from the beginning of scream 1.  "Im a murderer, not a thief" -Ghostface
Ghost face cult 💪💪💪
It’s Bryce Walker 😆
this is really freaking awesome......
Chunky Tvseries, Halloween and now Scream ?!? Ooh the nostalgia! 💖
Damn, ghostface is now a hacker
Me “how have they made 5 of these movies?” Also me “I can’t wait to watch it”
THEY BROUGHT BACK THE ORIGINAL CAST IM SO HYPED
LOOKS STUPID I LOVE SCARY MOVIES BUT I THINK AFTER THE 3RD ONE I STOPPED BECAUSE IT WAS GETTING FUNNY AND THEN IT LOST ALL MY INTEREST IN THE WHOLE SERIES OF MOVIES
Technology can be a MOFO...🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪
What age rating is this
god the familiar phone ring that scares me to death when i hear it after i watched the first one i never wanted to hear that sound again.
Dewey is prolly my favorite character lol
I have a question for all of u which main character do u think dies
You know Sidney is a badass when Ghostface starts fangirling over her.
1:22 is that phin from spider man miles morales?
I love how Scream was meta referencing iconic horror movie franchises, and then essentially became an iconic horror movie franchise itself 😂
I love ghost face, I’m even being him for this Halloween.
LETS GOO ON MY BIRTHDAAAYYYY
Thats the scream cult killing haters
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Don't you mean Scream 5? If this was going to be a scream reboot none of the original cast would want to be part of it because it wouldn't make any sense just like scream season 3 reboot of the TV show had no involvement of the original cast from season 1 and season 2.
EXELENT MOVIE OTRA MAS DE LA SAGA
These are calm kills😌
Scream is gotta kick Halloween's butt next year.
Can't waittttttttt..... 😎
Jenna Ortega' s freckles are too cute. She's a beauty! 😍
Tiktok is ruining this for me
I dare someone in hollywood to make an original movie these days.
I’M SO READY 🔪🔪🔪🔪
It's odd knowing her from Disney Channel and seeing her in horror
That’s going to be dope
The scream franchise never disappointed me. I’m excited to see what this 5th film has for us😆
I love who even with the new movie just like the original movies they kill an established actor in the start of the movie
Why not 5CREAM
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Man I really hope it’s Stu underneath the mask. I hope that Matthew came back for the role due to *peer pressure*
I mean if they know he's hunting them just wear some kind of body armor under your clothes? He generally stabs people in the back or chest. Counter this by making it so he can't... But yeah Slasher logic.
I hope this movie series isn’t adapted to the whole killer is darker and scarier in the sequel. I want him to be the same clumsy, comedic villain we all know. It’s what makes him iconic.
No roger jackson
Plot twist - Sydney is the killer
ovo vec izgleda kao lajftajm verzija vriska sve vam jebem dokle bre vise
I remember watching the first film when I was like 8 at my older sister’s 12th birthday been hooked ever since!  Can’t wait
Trailer showed the whole movie
The First film was an absolute classic. The second was a brilliant horror slasher. The third was ok in parts. The fourth was a sleeper. This one however looks an absolute beast.
Yes.
يووووووه hooooooooo
Hmm, maybe There is a surprise from an old actor that’s the killer.
Now this is a movie I just got finished watching Halloween and that movie is so trash 😅 🗑️
I hope they don’t remove the comedy aspect of scream I feel like that’s what makes it iconic but from the trailer it’s only scares
With that intro where ghostface almost teleports I’m gusting there are two killers again
Is that the girl who played one of the Manson Family in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood? I bet she’s the killer.  She probably gets set on fire too somehow.
"A true classic never runs out of style"😉
ok im so freaking excited it answered all my questions like how is sidney connected to this again....i think its going to be really good i hope im not disappointed
Are there no original films anymore?
Hope the killer isn't obvious with the casting
I think it’s Stu coming back for Revenge.Even though he looked like he was dead in the original the new Ghost face seems so intense and out for revenge.they say that all the kills are related to the original people Stu knows all of them.And the Ghost Face sounds aged which Stu would be.It’s just a theory but I hope it’s not.
Bakwaass same story 😭😭😭
ghost face would have gone away sooner if scooby doo and the gang was there
Friday the 13th must be made  Jason Vorhees must not die  must be returned
So they’re going with the new Halloween movies route and just reimagining that killer as an older more vicious Version
This movie better be shittier than the first one cos the first one is lengendary
I really can’t take scream seriously anymore
Just do better than Halloween
Same like old version👎
why are they dropping a Halloween movie in January 💀
I hope this movie don't ruin my nostalgic childhood 😂😂 Looks good though
Damn! I miss Ghostface and Sidney.Can't wait for this!😱
Am I the only one who loves the SCREAM tv series as well? i love all the SCREAM movies!!
I think i will imagine non stop about " scary movie " when i watch this movie again lol
I hope they don't disappoint. None of the Screams have topped the original.
She better get joe Goldberg to get Ghostface 😂
goofy doofy is back
Really like how they still use landlines. That some reason makes it creepier because landlines these days are not used much
I'm calling it now! It's stu. He probably got off easy and only did 25 years because it was "peer pressure"
Why January 😐 Why not Now in october
I have a feeling the killer is Wes and richie and Sam
You know I always loved how the screen movies adapted to the times. The changes in technology would require him to adapt and know the technology better than most people.  That’s my favorite thing about Ghost Face his adaptability
one of the best franchises, I'm so glad ghostface is back
Definitely watching this in cinema’s rewatched the entire trilogy yesterday. I have a good feeling about rhis
:-/ yawn.. Liked Scream when i was younger.When i was a kid, "killers" like michael myers or jason voorhees has scared me, today not anymore :-). But i hope you folks have fun with this movie :-)
I just can't take the scream mask seriously after watching Scary Movie lol
Nostalgic days!!!
this movie will be better than Halloween 2021.
Hello sidney
Whaaaaasup
Everyone attacked & killed is related to Billy Loomis & Stu Macher. I'm gonna be pondering & losing serious amounts of sleep over the begged question for this.  "Who is the killer?"  First guess... Sid finds out her mother never died. Maybe she was attacked & went into hiding after & MAYBE she is seeking vengeance on Billy & Stus WHOLE families so that they know what it feels like to have everyone you ever loved die. Or... Randy, Cotton, or even Tatum. Anyone that was IN the original first script & "died" has a huge potential to be the killer. Normally they're after Sidney... in this one, it's JUST relatives of Billy/Stu being targeted. Is someone out for revenge on BEHALF of Sidney?   So. Many. Fuck!ng. Questions.  This has some twisted revenge/vengeance type shit written all over it, and I am "100% Cotton" HERE FOR IT.   🔪 🔪 🔪
i love it how the end where the knife made a sound then did the title
DAMN! Scream 2022 AND Halloween Ends in 2022? Awesome year for horror movies coming up
watching the trailer before sleep probably a terrible idea for sweat dreams later
high hopes for this
WAaaasssssup!!! :D
Leave it up to youtube to delete my negative comment to promote this sequel that has been remade plenty of times by bored hollywood that cant come up with something original just copy edit paste & post
It might be just me but I think might be Stu still alive and the killer of this movie
I have a friend who is a hardcore fan of all Scream movies. He has made more than 10 marathons by now.
I can’t wait

My favorite part was the stabbings.
Looking forward to this movie 🎬

It's 2021, the killer is Sidney , she became a nonbinary who identifies as the mask, downloaded the voice effect and the costume filter in the AppStore and is trying to win a TikTok challenge
Did they remake this or this still the same Sequel ?
Cook
Goosebumps when hello sindi heats again in my ears after all these years
Bring back memory
Wow new movie coming never seen this one im excited
Ghostface is one of my favorite movie slashers, but there was another that came out in the '90s and could be the fifth one:   Ben Willis of "I know what you did last summer."
Am I tripping or is the original house in this trailer!? 🥲
This movie is going to blow like Halloween kills did. Just trying to make a quick buck off the name of what was once a good movie
is that dylan the lead singer of wallows band?
i would respectfully let ghostface murder me
January.....yawn As if they didnt put this out in october....wtf
This movie give's me really a big hope about this movie will be good movie as others
0:35 hello!?!?!?!? wheres the part where the spam to call police knowing they wont do anything
goosebumps is real
Need more comedies, this will be hilarious.
I'm pumped
This one looks much darker than the other 4.
If it isn’t skeet or Matthew, then I don’t want it
The part where he steps on someone’s leg…ouch!
Welcome Back SIDNEY......
Bro! These previews look good 🤗!
Ghostface in my opinion is the best looking horror character...
A brother and sister duo out for revenge on the relatives of the original killers and not after Sidney this time. Work out out folks 😉
oh myyy ggoddd
I guess they won't let Sidney to have a peace and normal life
Chucky Have New Series So GhostFace Deserve Get Too..
this looks incredible! courtney cox looks like shit!
So boring movie... Hahahahaha
Wonder what meta-commmentary theyre going for with this one? Perhaps commenting on resurgence of dormant series like Halloween?
So they are giving Scream the Halloween treatment. Even brought back old characters. I ain't complaining, this looka promising.
Who still has a home phone these days?! And in a smart home of all places!?
Poor Sydney, she must be getting tired of this shit by now
Holy Plastic Surgery Courtney Cox!!! Way too much! Looking like a member of the puppets from team America
Cant be as bad as that absolute garbage Halloween kills
Jesus Christ - Apologies in advance - Neve Campbell - Looks *great* - but, "Gale Weathers": looks like the victim of a plastic surgeon's worst nightmare. Scariest looking villain in the whole movie by far 👍
Plot twist, Matthew Lillard comes back to play Stu and he enacts revenge on Sydney.
This are the movie need squel not home sweet home alone ruin the original
It should be renamed to “scream 6” because dashie already made millions of the 5th installment back in 2015
Sidney is the killer. She’s proactively killing relatives of the original killers to avoid dealing with another possible copy cat.
Life is more precious life is wealth stay tuned with actor dwyane johnson rock new movie #TheKing Author Venkat 😎
So is it horror ? Or crime?
Thank you 😊 for remastered scream
Look great and I can't wait I'm a big fan of scream  my cousin liked this movie because of Jenna Ortega lmao well I'ma keep it a surprise for them unless they watch the trailers
This is an Nightmare.
10 years ago scream 4 scared the ever living shit outta me and it’s prolly gonna happen again
RIP Wes Craven
bro why doesnt the girl just push gun out tactical gbrs group style and squeeze the trash berreta mag into this dude
THIS IS GONNA BE SO COOL
I cant wait for this masterpiece
"Something about this feels different!" Pretty sure you said that the last 4 times!!
Now we just need a new scary movie 6
After all this time they don't travel around with shot guns.
First hollowed costume Rip Wes craven ❤️🔪
Did You See That
I hope we see Stu
Scream might be one of the only horror movies in the world that can pull off 5 amazing (or seemingly amazing) movies of the same franchise
Scawy.
This seems so much darker and intense. Can't wait
Sydney's Back😄😄😄
Okay, I wanna know why the fuck her first instinct was to open the door.
Is she still  living
LETS GO!!!!!!!!!
Now I was hyped for Halloween kills, but this, this puts a smile on my face
Hope the movie had comedy like In the past movie and also some horror
Already know who’s the killer it’s obvious
This better not flop. The _Ghostface Killer_ is my favorite murder-movie killer, so I hope it's gonna be a good movie.
Trying to figure out the killer is always the best but at 2:10 the real mystery is Sid wearing a wedding ring?
2:01, the death of Dewey? Hmm, Gale seems pretty shocked
ah yes, hearing a scary sound coming from a killer that threatening to kill you and still opening the front door like an idiot
Yup, Hollywood is out of ideas...
Everybody here talking about (Halloween/Friday 13th/Nightmare on Elm Street & Scream..) franchises, but let’s not forget about ( I know what you did Last Summer) was great too. And I wish they could bring it back again!
it releases in january 14 my birthday lol
Ok but the way she got a scary phone call then decided to open the door at night-
Mmmmmm bed.
How many times dowey stab and still alive
Call of duty
I think that sadly Dewey will be the first kill of the movie…I think that the first three characters will be attacked but not killed as Dewey says “ 3 attacks” and not “ 3 murders” and I think that’s why Sidney says that she “won’t sleep until he’s in the ground” I think she is saying that because Ghostface kills Dewey and she wants revenge…oh and Sidney is definitely married, you never know it could probably be to Kirby….
i can remember back from the first one
everyone looks so different its crazy but i love these movies
The voice actor for ghost face sounds different in a bad way…..
?
Whats the one ghostface where hes like WAZZUP is it the 1996 one
It doesn’t look good I just don’t feel it Halloween was trash and this too.
Ghost face is back!!!!
𝙬𝙖𝙯𝙯𝙯𝙐𝙐𝙐𝙐𝙐𝙐𝙐𝙥𝙥𝙥𝙥 😎🤙👻
Chills!! January can't get here soon enough!🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Should've released this Halloween.
YAWN. Let me guess. The newcomers die in a very predictable way but the old cast survive and live to see another day in a  follow up movie that will just repeat the same process from movie number 1.
i love it <3
Myers, Ghostface?! Makes me want Krueger back!😁
Me and my girl haven't seen it yet we gonna watch it asap should could of been watched it
Dude
Another remake. Another good film destroyed.
This never get old bro
Join the cult
1:33 he could’ve just used dead hard
YESSSS most definitely gonna see it
I remember when the first scream came out …. Half way through it I couldn’t wait for them to make a second part..  love the scream franchise..
I can't wait! 🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪
What a surprise 😁 great 👍
I was expecting horror comedy like in the one at 1996 but okay..
WHAT A WASTE...HOLLYWOOD IS SHIT...A REMAKE OF AN ALREADY SHITTY MOVIE...THIS IS WHY I QUIT WATCHING TV AND  HOLLYWOOD MOVIESALL TOGETHER.......WTF.....
It looks so good and it is in my birthday
I will watch it cause of Dylan and I love his acting man
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Sadly it looks like it's gonna be another "Karen" movie. Hope not but it seems like it. ):
Wow what great nostalgia from 1997 when I was a teenager, saw this in the cinemas back then, they were packed to the rim with people. Good memories, I will definitely watch this classic remake.
The first scream was great, the killer didn't have supernatural teleporting powers like most slasher villains but there were 2 killers the entire time and it explains how he was seen outside and also inside houses. The sequels were good but not as good as the first, seems to me they are going back to its roots seeing Ghostface need up behind her after she locked all the doors automatically, can't wait to see this one.
Scream is a happy guy
I feel like the one burning on fire was Dylan
Omfg enough already
Damn, how many girls on this movie? Next movie ghostface will be a girl too? The feminism is everywhere. Lol
i get the feeling Dewey will die… they need to make Ghostface fucking terrifying, what better way to do so then to kill a legacy character everyone loves, im fine with the idea as long as he goes out like a total badass and not some wimp.
I ain’t gon lie. Scream getting toasted if he walk my way 💯
WAZZUP
Neve Campbell is my Childhood Supsense thriller fave character of all time ❤️
Can't wait for this 🔪🩸
YOU CAN NOT KILL DA VID AR QUETTE
In cinemas January 14th?! Why not at Halloween?
u know after the scary movie franchise... I just can't take that mask seriously anymore!😂
How much you wanna bet that Ice Nine Kills’ song ‘Your Number’s up’ is gonna be featured at some point in the movie?
Scary movie 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The killer is definitely Stu
This is just played out
In all of horror Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, and Friday the 13th are all said to be the “big three”, but in my opinion it’s a sinister seven. Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th, Scream, Annabelle, Child’s Play, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
this looks good
Are you guys running out of scripts to write that you have to bring back awesome 90 movies, where are are smart writers now?
Wtf, it's Clay Johnson
Wow, I didn't know Activision made a movie of GhostFace from WarZone skin... awesome!!!
OMG I AM SO EXCITED SCREAM IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE HORROR / SLASH FRANCHISE
OH MY GOD LOOK OUT IT'S THE MASK... oh wait, sorry, that's just Courtney Cox's new face
I will be watching this without a doubt. I have a feeling this is the last movie in Scream for the main characters so any one of them could die. Hopefully this will do great but I don’t understand why they are releasing in January.
The "who did it" slasher is back. It's always a surprise to to find out who the killer is and you can never really figure it out. I own all 4 and the 1st 3 are part of my childhood. Definitely a cult classic
How dare you hurt Jenna I will not forgive you
After more than two decades, nothing can beat the legendary opening scenes with Drew Barrymore.
Stu didn't die in the first one???? i just hope it's not another long last family member of sid
The fact the in Halloween and in Scream they kind of take us back to the first movie it's amazing.  In Halloween the characters from the First Halloween and going back in the same town, now Scream going back to where it all begin, chills  🥰🥺
Looks like shit
I cannot wait to see this
IM SO EXCITED THIS LOOKS AMAZING. ALL THE ACTORS AND ACTRESSES ARE RLLY GOOD TOO
Excelente, Tantos recuerdos de los 90’s!
Can't believe I haven seen this when it came out
Hollyweird is running out of movies to make! Reboots/Remakes. Or actors/actresses in capes. Smh
honestly, the beginning looks serious/dark,FINALLY! and the actress make it seems real ! i like the previous scream movies, but they'r just not dark enough
PARAMOUNT PICTURES ! ! ! thank you, ill never get tired of Scream
Looks incredible. Huge fan of this film series. CANT wait and and I love the fact that Sidney, Gale and Dewey are back.
i grew up on scream but this looks absolutely trash. smh
People say the person who does not have apple phone are villain sydney has an Android dewie has Apple and if you pause one of the scenes you see sydneepys hand holding a knife?
Wazzzzuuuup
Scream, Halloween, Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street are the kings of the kings! Can’t wait to see this, please god let us! 🥺🖤
Can't wait!!!
Honestly  humour consistently in the scream movies in a thing ghostface is just a human and he can make mistakes so him slipping while he is on fire could lighten the movie I want to be scared but little things like that would take this movie to the next level
Oh yeah scream movie fan here i love ghostface
this shit is going to be sick bruh im in scream cult on tiktok
They stole way too much of this from Halloween
The first clip isn’t even scary that shit had me rolling 💀
The killer is stu, notice how at 1;26 he goes to raise the knife to murder the man like stu did in scream one, both hands on the knife and it being above his head, if it's not stu it may be Dylan Minnette, the actor might be related to stu.
2:00 dewy is sadly prob dead
It's been 10 years since scream 4 released I'm excited
When you suddenly see one remaster after another in the world of cinema, you realize that cinema has run out of creativity.
This looks insane
I can never un see scream from scary movies   Wazuuuuuuuuup!
cringe af
i watched michael myers he can't die..but he kills the others ..
worse than the last scream 4?  remind me of hallween kills?
Top 5 slashers, Jason, Michael, Freddy, Ghostface and Leatherface  In no particular order
Time for those Wayans Bros Parody movies to come back out!!!!!!
Damn. Clay Jensen can’t take a break from all this misery at his high school
Wow…it Aready sucks
The way they spoiled one of the killers @ 2:02, put it at 0.25 speed and compare clothes throughout trailer and you will see who one of the killers is. (if you still can't see it and wanna know message me)
Umm I doubt is good. Seems generic to me. Specially the first scene. Hopefully the rest is something we have never seen before and the killings are creative.
What a joke....
Scream 5
That’s the same girl who plays tinkerer in miles morales
January is now my favorite month
Can’t wait
Sidney who? I'm guessing she was in the original.
I hate that modern films involve the mobile phone and tech so much to make it  "relatable" to the new generation, like oooo so scary she got a text and notification about her door... like what?
Dewie is the killer.
2:08 That delivery is amazing
I always expect funny things to happen because I have seen scary movie way too many times
Yay!😍
Ghost face returns
That's why you should never own those dumb google security locks on your door 🤣
I hope the next trailer is completely different character deaths and it’s all contradicting this one, so we genuinely don’t know what to expect
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
it doesn’t really look scary
I love that mask
WAZZZZZZZZUPP BROTHERS
Is this Danny Johnson?
Cool
Something tells me that Dewey doesn’t make it in this one ...
Wake me up when its over ....ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzz
What if stu survived the whole time or billy shows up some where that would be a twist
The 13 reasons why kid is the killer. He's taller. A few snap clips show him towering over people so definitely 1 male killer. He also resembles are younger version of Stu. Maybe a little brother who looked up to him?
We all know that the first girl (Jenna) is dying for sure.
Eeee, Monica finally left Chanandler Bong 🤣
Soooo ready
Listen to when he says “hello sidney” it sounds a lot like Matthew Lillard …. Ik roger l jackson does the voice but just listen
I hope this is the start of a new trilogy.
Damn they got old!
2:14
1:43 blonde kid gotta be Freddie Prince Jr’s son… that or he’s just a young doppelgänger of him! Lol
11M 😱❤️ Like it if this excites you
No way he actually runs?
It’s gotta be stew. He’s the only one we never saw getting hauled off after the tv fell on him. We didn’t actually SEE if it killed him.
Omg... I can wait... the date is already booked in my schedule.... I love a good thriller.
is this a reboot or what?
Killing the guy in wheelchair was just unfair
It’s ok but for some reason ghost face isn’t scary to me. Like if I was getting chased my a normal man it would be more scarier then getting chased by ghost face
Still missing the same magic as the first two
Omg this looks awesome. Jenna Ortega plays the role chefs kiss 😘
I miss this series.
whenever i see ghostface i just see doofy
Scream 1 was all time favourite
It's Stu's house fuck yeah
First scream movie is the best
I so want to see this version even though I don't like rebbots
Oooop
I FUCKING HATE IT SO MUCH IN MOVIES  WHEN THEY TYPE ON THEIR PHONES AND THEY ADD THE RETARTED SOUND EFFECTS!!!!!!! ALSO JUST NAME IT SCREAM 5 TO AVOID CONFUSION YOU MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!!!!                           Anyways, very nice looking movie :D
gets threatened on the phone.. *immediately opens front door*
Can’t decide if I like the old cast being involved or absolutely hate it
This new scream sucks.  How does he/she have 3 attacks but no kills. Maybe they’ll change that line of dialogue in the movie.
Ghostface look more skilled now
Damn i didn’t kno “helmet” is on here lol now i wanna watch it even more💀😂
Michael Myers didnt die in the newest movie Now: There still not gonna know who the killer is!  Boring!!!!
Trailer shows too much bruh
The mini black flashing when ghost face started chasing that guy was so beautifully made
Is it just me or did this feel like a parody
Can't fucking wait!!!
If the killer is Matthew lillard I’m weak
I can’t take this seriously after watching scary movie 🤣
In 2045....Scream Part 18 in theatres!
This series is such trash. I've never understood it's appeal. The Ghostface mast isn't scary in the slightest, and frankly, after the Scary Movie franchise, it's just a bit of a joke.  "But Scream 1 was so meta and different, blah, blah, blah"  Well New Nightmare is also by Wes Craven, it's even more meta, and the far superior film.  This franchise needs to scream it's way to the grave.
I’ll “Scream” if the killer is Stu.
Fuck yea this looks fucking great can’t wait to see it
Can't wait
this killer is gonna be more violent then any other scream, he already launched 3 attacks, and one of the characters said “this one feels different”
It's like a bad copy of halloween... this is horrible
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA NOW THERE ARE RULES TOO xDDDDDDDDDDDD
NICE! Let's copy jigsaw for every movie now. First squid game and now this... Im tired of games can someone think of something better now? What the hell they doing there in hollywood?
This killer looks like he is alot more brutal, savage and well built then all the others
First, Halloween. Now, Scream. The classic slasher films are returning! I’m here for it.
Why Not just Relise it on Halloween this year
I really can't wait for the story to continue and I'm really excited to see how it ends - it will definitely be a great movie 📽️
Yayyy lol this will be good
To be honest, Ghostface may not have the body counts Jason, Michael, and Freddy have but what Ghostface has that the other three don’t is true originality. Scream has never tried copying the others and more or less played into the tropes that make horror movies no longer scary. Now Scream is taking the realism to a all new level by incorporating security system hacks and homage to what makes Wes Kraven so great. Love the Scream movies and I love Ghostface. Personally Ghostface beats Jason, Michael, and Freddy just purely off of realism.
I like the fact that it's connected to the original movie but i hope they don't try to make it super deep and complicated. I just want to see a normal slasher type film with characters that i know and love.
KRING!2x
sindy
lets gooo i used to watch 1 2 3 4
I already know who’s the killer in this movie…….. CLAY JENSEN!!!!!!
When I watch Halloween kills I knew they was gonna play this trailer and it felt sooo damn awesome to watch this on big screen. I can't friggin wait!!
They should make this like Danny Jonson
E
Always the same 🤣
I hope it will also be comedy cuz right now this looks just like a random horror movie
Sidney is still beautiful.
I can't wait for this
Bloodclaaat 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲 SCREAM is back!!
i would love to give yah a movie a had in my dream for free about satan 💯 the true story not the bible one 💯 im tired of people saying lucifer is bad rns
JENNA ORTEGA YES
Dewey looking like a badass
Imagine Jamie Lee Curtis teaming up with Neve Campbell in a crossover.
So will this movie involve time travel just like Stab 5?
New version of Michael Myeer 2022
Spoiler alert: Doofy was the killer
I think that tenn girl was Jenna Ortega
WHAZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZUPPPPPP!!!!
after Scary Movie, i can't take this serious.
REPENT! Christ is coming back to judge the world! We are all guilty of sin, but Christ loves you so much that He died so you can be free! Take His blood as a remission of sins, and you will be saved!
I'm sure dewey is the most hurt, always him haha
I miss the old Ghostface voice but im hyped for this movie it's been 10 years since the fourth movie came out
Oh HELL!! This looks awesome!!!
This is from the same people who did Ready or Not. Hope they don't fucking this up
no doubt about it. ghost face is the best killer from all the killer movies
It ticks me off that I have to watch a Scream movie to see Neve Campbell act ... she's great. She should be in more movies. That one with the Rock kinda made me nauseous, but she's great.
Happy fucking new year haha Ghost face returns in 2022!
SIDNEY, DWIGHT, ETC IS JUST SO NOSTALGIC AND SO AMAZING
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
SPOILER!!      .         .      .  Dewey is gonna die!!! D:
Another stupid remake
The series that brought back slashers has returned , bring it!
Leave scream alone it doesn't need a remake
I can’t wait!!
Also that whole first murder could of been solved by using key locks like a normal human being instead of retarded smart locks.
Why remake a classic from the greatest horror director of all time? This movie will be like eating unbuttered popcorn. It's OK but I'd rather have God damn butter.
Imma wait for dead meat
It's like Halloween...never ending🤣
Terra is gonna be like the girl In the beginning if scream 1
Dewey looks like a badass dropping his bullets on the floor
Hmm I wonder if this Ghostface will fall and smash into everything while he or she chases the victims as usual
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Best scream movie so far!
So Cox and ex hubby had to work together. Awkward.
So lessons to learn. 1. Don’t get smart locks. 2. Buy and learn how to use a gun, get good at head shots. 3. Wear bullet and stab proof vest. 4. Learn basic hand to hand.
I love scream movies
That pumpkin pie the other day was very polite.
I love scream and cant wait
people with this skin in warzone suck
Booooo
Can’t wait
Stus original house? That be kinda crazy if Stu was still alive
I love how they have kept the same core of stars in this movie. I wish NOES would have kept the dream warriors around for a few movies.
I hope it’s as fun and self aware / hilariously meta as the original 2… this looks pretty serious and dark from the trailer.. but still excited
I miss Randy already.
I just watched Dune in theaters last night and this was one of the previews. As soon as I heard the voice on the end of the phone.......I got childlike excited "NO THEY DIDN'T....YES THEY DID!!!" lol I don't care what anyone says, the franchise is great, you can sort of skip Scream 2 (except the opening scene), but every other one is still scary, still believable within the Woodsboro universe, and the original actors are really great!! Also RIP Wes Craven you scary ghoul!! :)
I'm in, 1000%. But let's be real... some of our returning favorites have to die this time. You can't keep bringing back the old gang and having them ALMOST get killed but somehow survive every time. It's not that I want them to die, mind you. But for this one to really "feel different" (as Dewey says), no one can be safe. Not even Sid.
THANK YOU HORROR GODS FOR ALL THESE DOPE UPCOMING SPOOKIES <3
😬
Sonic the hedgehog 2 coming in 2022 Amy shadow metal sonic sliver blaze cream cheese werehog sonic super sonic rouge vector charmy espio infinite big tangle tikal longclaw
So Jack Quaid is 100% one of the killers
Do people still have landlines  nowadays?
SCREAM 5 is here , Let’s go everybody . I want everybody in the premiere of this movie 🍿 🤷🏼‍♂️🤗🙏🏻😍😍. “Hello Sidney, It’s an honor  🔪” . Best part of trailer film 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😍😍😍. I think  in this time , It’s the last Stab or we are having a new sequel in the next year? Scream 6????. We want it 😍😍😍😍😍. Sidney,Gale e Dewey are returning for more a Scream 😱. #Scream5.
here we go again!😄
* Is happily afraid.
Hope its funny Tbh
No
Can’t wait 😝
That line "ITS AN HONOR" gives me goosebumps!!!! God I hope they don't fuck this up!!!🔪🔪🔪   (Holy shit thanks for all the likes)
Yoooo why's that 1 dude with the nice car doing his hair like my man Billy Loomis!!!
i always wished that Tatum (Dewey’s sister) survived because i believe that she would be so badass in this movie even though she was kinda dumb lol Also Randy should’ve lived cuz he would make the movie so hilarious!!
I’ll never be able to really get scared by watching this. I’ll think of Monica anytime Courteney Cox appears on screen.
What if  its john wick home .
the one horror movie series that i actually love
Oh, like in Saw.
Noice.
SURPIRSE SYDENY
Take heed women, stop messing with your face and lips, Neve Campbell looks better than Courtney. bless them both though. Can't wait for this.
Nothing but remakes of old movies  No one has any imagination for scary films anymore
lol
Micheal Myers coming back, Ghostface coming back, Jason Voorhees lawsuits ending maybe? Time to bring back the Boogeymen
Listen to this...Plot twist!! What if Dylan Minnette (Blonde Kid) is the killer and secretly Stu's son. He leads the main characters aka Sydney and others to Stu's house, he starts talking about how he wants revenge on sydney for TRYING/ATTEMPTING to kill his dad (still hasn't mentioned his dads name, which could be Stu). And then from around the corner in the kitchen or out of the closet where Stu put Sydney's dad, Stu says "Surprise Sydney"...Like he did in the first one when she found out that Billy and Stu were the killers. That would be Epic!
🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪
Plus I love these movies gotta watch the fourth one
am exited for this one....
SO NO NEW IDEAS
damn they old
gotta respect the actors from the first movie for coming back to fight the mf of scream again
REAL ACTORS FAN THEORY: Someone makes a copycat of the movie "Scream" with David, Courtney and Neve playing their real life selves in this movie. The Hello Sidney at the end is different from the it's an honour line so they could have just grabbed the Sidney from somewhere else... Dewey on the phone says it's happening... i.e a real life killing story...Then the rest of the cast are actors but are actual "real" in terms of the movie.
Oh HELL YEA LETS GET IT
It's Doofy
I’m so hype for this, been a huge scream fan since childhood
Another comedy 🤮
The only thing this trailer hasn't revealed is the killer
Doofy?
"Scream" is the best horror movie,  where the killers are human
Come on, who needs this.... The movies were always terrible...this looks as equally shitty...
FUCK YEAH!
I love how they go back to the old house
i HAVE BEEN CRYING OVER THIS!
When will Myers Jason Freddy ghost face killer Chucky ever die come on this isn't the 80s or 90s anymore try for another insidious I guess
Others...-I Know You From Friends.. Monica Geller......-I Knowwwww
I'll be right back!!
I bet the main characters kid or kids are the killers.
It's fuckin stuuu
It's Stu. He's back . Payback for Billy
What will Riverdale look if it was a flim..
SCREAM is my all time favorite!  I am so glad the trio is back & they MUST SURVIVE!  This looks so good!  But if any of them die, I'll probably be very upset.
0:33 that's why you should not rely on A.I
I SAW MONICA OMG
Cool
Can october be better now!?
No way, original cast members coming back to "finish the job". I've never seen that before.
This is it, horror movies are about bounce back with all this from halloween to scream to Texas chainsaw all coming back i predict eventually Jason & Freddy would make a comeback also
same stupid shit all over again. I'm fatigued.
"children's games", "Halloween" now "scream" left to wait for the new part "Friday the 13th"
Is kirby in the wheelchair 👀👀👀
The house on sorority row? The dorm that dripped blood? Splatter university? Graduation day? Final exam? Am I close?
we are waiting thanks for coming
I miss Sydney so much
Scream 4 was an embarrassing misfire. But I have to admit I perked up once I saw that the original cast was coming back. Then I saw that it was being released in January, and I lost all hope...
Reading lots of Internet buzz the killer is Stu
Is doffy going to be in it
This is a total rip off of the movie “yell”
Really on my birthday I don’t know if I should be worried or not
Who wants to bet the new ghost face is once again Sydney's long lost relative and will get shot at the end of the movie. Only for they're identical twin to jump out at the last second.  Or something like that.
There is going to be a good 'stab' at the Conjuring movies, right? ("No, a real scary movie"?)
I can't wait for the inevitable Halloween 2018 jokes.
After so many great and amazing trailers for these horrendous movies that we saw over the last two years and were glad didn’t waste our money in a movie theatre, I have a gut feeling this will be even worst than scream 3. When a minute of a 2:30 minute trailer is all about a girl we have no clue who she is or even care about at this point, where maybe we will when the movie comes out, but for most of the trailer to be focused on this chick when we’d have rather have seen more clips of the returning characters, with all these awful movies being made, they shouldn’t be worrying about covid making movie theatres a thing of the past. They should be more concerned with actually making a great film. If the least likely film out of the ones you were more excited about ended up being cruella, where it surprised me that Disney took a chance on a dark movie, but great storyline, fun, even loved cruella acting more like Harley Quinn than the cruella we knew, that movie surprised me. But only one great movie in the last two years? Not good!
0:24 she has a wound already before she gets stabbed?
Jenny Ortega is dying first
Please dont Kill Sydney, I Love her and Scream Willn't Alive without Sydney and Samantha
*Wazzzaaaaaaa!!!!!!*
Just posted a trailer concept  for my new short horror film would appreciate some feedback and follow me if you like it.
It’s stu a samantha
If they don’t make scream have funny comments In this movie
Doofy is the killer.
Joder estoy ansioso, es Uno de Mis Slashers Favoritos en Survive The Night En Roblox y Nunca me lo quito, a menos que sea una ocasion especial, Es Silencioso, Y Siempre da Alarmas Claras y avisos de tener Cuidado, Quedara marcado para mi como el Mejoe Slasher
Are they really calling this SCREAM not SCREAM 5?
The scares are on point but where's the wit? Scream movies are meant to have satirical humour as well.
But can he beat me no I’m to fast
Holy shit am I ready
Scream 5?
Half of me is sad because it's not a Wes Craven film :(
Why in January and not October??
All that is Missing is Ozzy's No More Tears!!! Spookiest serial killer song ever!
WASSSZZZUUUPPPP
Tara's facial expressions in this are next level, it's pure horror. Totally paying homage to Casey Becker right there.
Who on earth still has a home phone?
Halloween better
Ayo bro this movie is going to be lit. I can't wait to see it in theaters.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
I can't wait for this! All my favorite characters coming back too! <3
WAZAAAAAAAA
It would be awesome if Dewey was the killer and his partner would be revealed as stu.
all the scream movies sucked ass but this one looks really good
Whasup?
There could be a gang that who's been wearing that ghost mask.
There could be anyone who have ghostface mask like a gang.
As an investor its pleasurable to see how Scream is based on the modern technologies of the day and that's scary. To see someone unlocking your front door is crucial
Moral: never install "smart" home
Hey that "hello Sydney" sounds familiar scream 1 wait? Could it be?(joke after this)like zoinks Sydney jeee you gotta die
DADDY
films always have these epic characters who have history of dealing with whatevers going on.
Man Dewie looks badass, let’s just hope he doesn’t get his ass kicked again
Probably another woke horror sequel, Halloween type...
Its sooo ezz to beat scream tbh this mf is legit dogwater
"I won't sleep until he's in the ground" and "I'm Sidney Prescott of course I have a gun" Hits different
Dylan’s in this movie. That’s so sick!!!!
Everyone says that Halloween, Friday the 13th and a nightmare on Elm Street are 'the big three' but i think that Scream deserves to become the fourth.
So hyped. I just hope this time ALL scenes from the trailer will be in the movie. Will never forgive them for cutting Gale's line "go ahead if you have the guts"
Definitely a reprieve from Scream 4 because it was too comical. The vibe was not hitting right. This looks promising!
Plot twist: Its Sidney!
It better be stu
You know its bad when call of dutys new scream refrences and their new trailer looks better than this......yikes
All we need now is Jason,Freddy,Texas chainsaw massacre reboots and we back in slasher buiness 🔪 🩸
Looking forward to having the Scream skin in Fortnite next year.
'phone ringing' sidney:who is this?  ghostface:Hello sidney  would you like to play a game sidney:'hangs up'  also sidney:its show time
great stuff
Soo is Sydney gonna in this one marking the final movie?
Yo wtf the movie comes out on my birthday
That gril acting so exaggerated
ghost face is kinda toxic
New Scream movie, after 5 times Scary Movies? 🤔 😀 This gonna be a hard one
“Original characters band together to end him once and for all” apparently all the old horror producer met in a room and agreed on the same idea
Woman being stabbed is so sexy
Only scream experts answer this question is scream a human?
I wish we could have new movies with new stories
Now this is a scream movie🍾
WASSSSSSSSSSSUPPPPP
I was hoping this would be good but I've lowered my expectations a lot after seeing Ready or Not. Thought it was really stupid.
ซิดนี่ย์ มาทุกภาค
legend......
Finally a realy realistic scream movie
Dammm it’s been a while. My prediction is it’s a younger brother or nephew of one of the original killers.
geez how many times can you redo the exact same opening scene
if my baby stu aint back im not watching this
Wait, is Sidney married? I noticed a ring on the finger in the last clip
Oh wow is that Jenna Ortega?  They gave her the Drew Barrymore treatment
Wazzuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup?
good trailer
Finnaly
There’s no way it can be real
Funny
I always remember scary movie movies when I see scream trailers
The 2.2k dislikes are from people who had a jump scare while watching the trailer and hit it by mistake   As of 10.21.21....8:26am pink sweater..sitting on my bus  Hey future Michael👋😃... did you like the Scream 2022 movie???
This just looks like the mtv series... but as a movie lol
Ваяяяяя , шо за пушка 😍
so the whole movie was in the trailer huh.
The trailer just kinda reminds me a lot of Halloween Kills
So sydney has witnessed 5 serial murder cases? LOL she must be cursed!
Its no way Jenna Ortega dies first
I am shocked there aren't more minorities in it.  Did they think it would not be PC to murder minorities?
At this point just stop answering the damn phone .
Dude should've used dead silence, wouldn't have failed that takedown - 0:27
ok so whats next a remake of friday the 13th or a remake of freddy krueger
0:49 THATS MY GUYYY!!! 😆😆😆 0:55 oh no, a JANUARY movie 😐😐😐
Jason  better 🤡
yes
Childhood
Looks like Halloween made enough money.
Looks like a fun time
Man I cant wait for this, its time i got scared again
Americans dont know when to end a movie...waiting 2055 for scream 100😒
hehe
Look at Courtney cox and Neve Campbell's faces. This IS a horror movie
I think the killer will turn out to be Sydney in this one
Does anyone have anything new, somthing original please.
Wow wonderful ❤️🥰
Ok... Now when will scary movie be released based on this?
did Jenna dirty for giving her a trailer death
The scary part starts right at the beginning
How does he stay so clean?     "Detergent companies HATE him"
Whatttttssssss uppppppp
Super hyped for this movie regardless but it'd be alot more cool if it released during this Halloween...😭
You know, I really miss Stanley...
IS THAT DUA LIPA
Seriously, please don't tell me you're making Jenna Ortega here like Ariana Grande in Scream Queens 😒🤦🏻
most people are saying its prob, Jack Quaid richie and Dylan Minnette wes, or one of them with an accomplice,
waaaaaaaasssssssuuuppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp  🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣
They literally casted have this movie with Netflix actors smh.
When I first heard they were making this movie I had the theory that the killer will be Sydney’s kid and I think I might be right
Y’all kids are about to get scared the way we did in the 90’s
YES
Now make a new scary movie.
WAZZUUP
Only shitty horror movies come out in january
a new halloween AND a new scream?? NICE
Movie gonna be lit
Can't wait for scream 7 when Sydney is a grandmother and still kicking ass
Yas Vanessa from in the heights is here!!
No way
2:15 -- not saying the movie is going to be bad, but that broken guitar strum/screech sounds amazing.
Welp, time to bring back the old question: "what's your favorite scary movie?".
Aight, 2:00 in and I see Gale freaking and Sid not letting her through... If Dewey gets more than a limp, I will lose it.
Kallofduty
Horrors are always the same
It looks more scary then the 1996 and 97 and the 3rd one.
Looks awesome, I can't wait to see it and I also can't wait to see who the "ghost face killer" is.
idk this isn’t sitting right with me
Wow scream again I love this movie I am so happy to see Sydney again I will definitely watch this movie 🇵🇰🇵🇰
This looks like shit.
Another reboot we don't need.
I’ll never forget scream was the first horror movie I SNUCK in to watch with all my 14 year old friends. Can’t think of ONE movie that was a disappointment They’re allllllll good
I'd watch this trailer  ... but I can't be disturbed when I'm vacuuming my room ✊
when the real GHOSTFACE takes over.
I know it's not good for business but as a movie buff I wish all the horror movies released in late September and throughout October. Would make the spooky season that much spookier. Scream, Halloween, The Black Phone, Paranormal Activity, and even Ghostbusters...all look fun.
Micheal Myers never dies scream never dies wtf
Nice move holding back on the jokes.
Lol I can't take scream seriously after scary movie, dafuq doofy doing in the ghostface mask looooool
Ghost face gonna be Dylan minnette
Horror fan
Wow, I didn't even know there was a teaser until today. And it's coming out a week after my birthday!😃
The end that noise sounds like flight laugh
Just make Randy the killer. Why not.
Besides Halloween, Scream is my fav movie franchise. I never get tired of watching it. Even when it's not Halloween month❤❤❤RIP WES CRAVEN
Looking forward to this and Sonic 2, what can I say I have no scale of what I like
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
*De por si la original se me hace mala y sin sentido esta va por el mismo camino*
i’m so excited, i’ve been obsessed w horror movies sence like 4 yrs old, this is awesome <3
They know me for my one-tap
I have not heard the character "ghost face" say his famouse catch phrase where he say "Wazzup". I am imesurablibltilitefsdgfvvdses disapoiunted in you disney!
"Whatever links us to the past, it's pulled us back here...". You mean a paycheck?
awesome that it is not a remake or reboot! sucks that it looks like garbage shit trash.
I love how they have to call it 2022 movie in parentheses because naming a sequel is such a fucking taboo thing to do nowadays
I get so excited by these movies it's almost concerning.  This one I pray lives up to the trailer.  Women's empowerment and guns.  Sounds like fun.
I will go see this movie, but the fact that is showing on january scares me bc almost all bad movies go to january
This Years Halloween trated us very good😩🔥🔥🔥🔥😍🥰it beens a long time
I cant take this movie seriously after seeing Scary Movie lol
whoever the boyfriend is is the killer but low and behold it will probably be a female lol
1:45 so badass Dewie
ok they made ghostface hot again, good job
Why? Why? Why did all these franchises decide to remove numbers from their titles? It's ridiculous.
🔪 Can't wait!!😱💥🥰🩸looks a scream 🎬🎟 *riots* 📽
Omgggg im SCREAMIIINGGGGG
I'm seriously not expecting to see Sydney, Gale, and Dewey after all these years. 😍
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Can we stop killing children in movies yet?
Ffs not again
I do hope it’s stu that comes back but there is also the fact that Charlie says Sydney it’s a honor in scream 4 maybe it can be something to do with him aswell
I want the scary movie version of this
Why does this have 2.2k dislikes.  This movie looks like it’s gonna be good
0:45
Can't wait
This looks really generic, I was expecting something more original from a sequel to a Wes Craven movie.
Nice to know we have another 2 killers, if a Scream movie doesn’t have 2 killers then it’s just not gonna feel like a Scream movie
Lame.
LEGENDARY!!! I AM THE GREATEST MUSIC ARTIST OF ALL TIME!!! LOVE!!! THANK YOU GOD AND THANK YOU UNIVERSE!!!
11 years... but time flies.
It looks to me to be a big flop!! I didn't mean any disrespect or hate... Just to keep things clear.
Why is it called “Scream” ??? It’s NOT a reboot! It’s Scream 5!
1:36 is that stu maches house
Isnt that how stu holds his knife
Don t trust system
It’s got the voice and the crew. This looks amazing. I’m not a slasher fan, but I keep coming back to these movies.
Yo the cast looks sick! Expectations are quite high now! XD
about time everyone related to this family should really self defense classes man. they're screaming after all these years .. i mean scream all you want but take the classes.- and use them!
Scary movie 1 brought me here
Halloween and then Scream, Friday the 13th should be next
YES!!
Prediction:  Skeet Ulrich is coming back for this one as the killer but not as Billy Loomis, but as Billy Loomis' long lost identical twin.
Scream has been done to death, do we really need another ?
I been through this.. alot.  😂 Im excited. Honestly wouldn't know about this if it wasn't for call of duty
How come they won't call it "Scream 5"? It's like the same thing with Sam Jackson's 2019 film, Shaft.
All we need is a new Friday the 13th. All these classic horror franchises have been getting sequels or reboots, but we haven't had a new Friday the 13th since 2009.
i didnt expect monica to be here😂
Why don't they release these movies during fall/halloween time?
Oh no why is it being released in January? The trailer didn’t seem that bad but makes me suspicious
Ghostface: wanna play a game   Jigsaw: shut the fuck up ghostface stop stealing my lines
I wonder what part design of this costume has changed for this new scream release.
NO WAY
yoooo this guyt is from call of duty bro i saw him in my game bro from call of duty warzone guyssss
Really wish he could bring back the "what's your favorite scary movie?"
Surprise, Sidney!!
1:02 -Do you have a gun? -Im American of course i have a gun
Goose bumps....suddenly i feel aged looking at the old Scream series star cast :D
Looks absolutely dreadful
Wes Craven?
Who remember that mask?
Worst movie finally gets the shitty reboot it deserves
うぉーーー楽しみ シドニー懐かしい！ 絶対観る
the slow mo shot of him walking towards the girl in the beginning is 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
I SEEEE DYLANNN I CANT WAIT OMFG
waaaaz zuppppppppppp waaaa zaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
now he is hacker
Omg realised January 14 my b-day is 13 omg i watched this movie! 😩😳
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Omg finally they made it
"DOORS UNLOCKED. ALL DOORS LOCKED. DOORS UNLOCKED"  😂😂😂
What a great movie. Looking forward to it! From indonesia with love
Scary movie smokin weed Made scream less horror. Unsee the weed smoking
“something about this one just feels different” let’s gooo
Waaasssssup
The big bois are comming back to the old town road
DUDE THE “hello sidney” GAVE ME CHILLS
Can't wait! In the meantime, going to watch Scary Movie 1 again
Trasssh
So Stu not dead that they killed billy in the first one but they didn't kill Stu
I'm calling it rn, Clay is the school shooter
Is this the one in netflix or not?
Looks like the old movie come on peopel Hollywood  running out of shit to make now i think
Literally showed Sidney watching Amber on fire so she is clearly Ghostface
it’s Stu. he’s back.
This is exciting.
Scream scared the shit out of me as a kid. I watched it for the first time at my uncles house when I was in year 6. Been hooked ever since
First Halloweens and now Scream. Can wait for friday 13th next.
Are you friggin kidding me?!😳🙄😴😴😴😴😴
Courtney Cox look good here 🔥😍🙊
I have a feeling the Courteney Cox screaming/being held back shot is actually gonna be right near the conclusion. Right as one of the killers comes back for “one last scare”… and either Dewey or Sidney will turn around and shoot them dead. It looks more like a: everyone thinks the carnage is over, and they yell “no!” to try to warn them. I don’t think it’s her looking at a dead body, or a reaction to losing Dewey or Sidney.
wouldn't it be wild af if the killer is revealed to be a group of students related to the original killers like they said, and they all want vengeance on the big 3 and the sister who left town with her bf so they coordinate all the attacks to look real in order to murk them for taking out Stu and Billy? ......
Looks like a flop. Generic camera angles and color tones. The camera type is like the crappy streaming tv series show digital camera. The teen actors seem predictable. Pretty sure this was made quick as-well. Going back to original location cliche. The teens just don’t look approachable  😂. Scream 4 had the same problem.
Finally😍
Halloween then scream my God thank u
Hey, I just met you But I am crazy I know your number I'll call you Sidney
he should have been a batman villain
January 14 is the best gift before my birthday hoping cinema in the philippines well open soon
hope it doesnt end up being trash from the studios milking the series just like with halloween kills
That reminds me, I never got around to scream 4. Ah well, tis the season.
All they had to do was bring back Neve Campbell and I will be buying my ticket, Thank you.
WHY? I'm tired of these remakes
why does this have less fews than shitty batman shit
I feel like this is either gonna be iconic because they are back together or is gonna be cringey and forced.
my back is ARCHING
I still prefer the original
Just because it works for scream doesnt mean crap like i know wat u did last summer should be back!!! PLEASE DNT DO IT
much fun!!!!
January release=garbage movie
I'm ready to scream
I can't wait for this movie to come out!! Also, s i d e n o t e : Are the 90's/early 2000's back in style? Wes Hicks rockin' some bleached blonde situation.
Ok, I have never seen the films before until last Sunday. I'm so ready for this installment :)
I wish horror movie sequels would have numbers again.
I see a lot of people saying that this is just copy and pasted every time and these movies will never be original or top the originals and I just think that’s a little unfair considering that there have been plenty of movies with better sequels than the originals.
HO-LLY SH-IT :)
Or watch the matrix 4
Oh nvm just listen to my song
if scream is made now then wbout scary movie
I'm glad it's not a remake. This looks fun.
Special Officer Doofy reporting
FUCKKKKK YEAH
Idk what to think, to me it seems like they’re just got inspired by the other attacks, and when he says “it’s an honor” it just makes it seem like they weren’t expected Sidney to pop up
It looks like trash..the originals weren't even all that good..these horror film directors and writers need better imagination
Official.
hey ghostface can you slide me jenna's #?
Salió hacker el prro 👻
You do realize that if you harm any of the original three characters, this is gonna be trashy right?
Betch what da fawk.. why did Jenna have to die?🤨
LOOKS GOOD
These damn remakes already pfft. Gay.
I might go see it
Please let this movie be good, it must be a horror masterpiece on scream which was a self aware 90s film following tropes around that era, this movie must utilize modern tropes without it feeling too cheesy
The funny movie 😩😩😩😎😎😝
It should've being called Scream 5
"What's uppppppp?!?!?!?! 😝"
Courtney cox🤗
Something about this one just feels different
The killer is Bolly Loomis back from the "dead"
Killer/killer(s) predictions: I think there will be two again. Maybe Randy's sister being 1. Out for revenge?  Maybe Stu/Billys sibling (if they have one)? Gale? Maybe her career/book sales are not doing well, so she wants some excitement? My guess--Billy's dad. He lost his wife and son. He has a reason to target Sid and co. Anyone else?
So he finished the work as Warsaw pact operator.
I'm never taking that mask seriously after watching Scary Movie (part 1) 😂
Awww man I had no idea this was coming out and I legit got chills!!!! Let’s go my baby Neve not going out without a fight… Let’s Go Ghost Face 👻 🔪 🔥🔥🔥
Dark and serious
Let's do it, I saw all four of them and I will definitely would want to watch Scream 5. 😎👍( the last movie trilogy that I saw all five of them was the Final Destination trilogy)
🗣Yesssssssss I can’t wait!!!!!!!!
Holy fucking shit. This movie and I know what you did last summer AGAIN? These fucking clowns have NO originality left.
Why did Tara Carpenter (Jenna Ortega) got attacked but Ghostface, that affected me so bad. P.S. Jenna Ortega is one of my favorite actresses so that trailer really affected me because i love her in other stuff like Stuck in the Middle & The Babysitter: Killer Queen.
Ellie should have used that money Joe was sending her for a better security system 🙄
WAZZZUUUUUUUUP!
Dang another one lol
😴😴
They’ve been teasing this  for about a year now
I heard the OG killer will be in this movie
Head shots
I love horror movies
Hello shawty😂😂😂⚰
The most terrifying thing was the door locks being hacked.
This looks terrible, the.
Good to see dbd getting its own Ghost Face spin off movie
I think the killer/killers will be either liv,the guy with the dirty/blonde hair, or amber but I kinda feel like if it’s amber it would be to obvious
Can't wait
Woohoo cant wait!
Can't wait to see this movie 😀
We all know truly there is only 3 scream movies and this will be the 4th
I want to go to cinema for this movie
Wtf now Scream can do hacking
A Scream movie in January?
これマジ！？
Oh yay more unoriginal ideas. Sweet....
Well hello Again Paramount. You are getting dark and gritty this halloween huh? I'm impressed.
Courtney Cox ruined her face.
Paramount, you need to join movies anywhere because ain’t nobody buying your movies on each platform multiple times
looks epic
Doofy did it
pause at 2:02... can see a slight glimpse of the killer. dark haired male.
AHHHHH OMG I CANT BELIEVE THEYRE REALLY MAKING A SCREAM 5!!!! IM OBSESSED WITH SCREAM AND RN IM SO FUCKING EXCITED AHHHHHH!!!!!
They should make Halloween Scream.
Omg!!!! This is absolutely awesome ! I can't wait to watch it!!!
I'm freaking out because this seems HUGE
Cant wait to see this they filmed this here in my hometown of Wilmington NC.  I'm so excited for this movie
This looks pretty good to be fair. I like the horror remake/reboot/modern follow trend that Halloween started.
Halloween, Scream...we need Jason!
I love how they kept screams mask in its original form and didn't modernize it in any way
Looks rlly good
I dig the modern take on the original opening
Yawn... Milking it...
S I D N E Y.
If Dewey dies I'm not counting this as canon.
It’s releasing on my bday!!
Isn't should be Scream 5?
When is Hollywood going to stop beating these dead horses and make something worth watching!?! The originals were horrible and infantile at best, now they want to insult our intelligence with another addition to one of the worst movie series of all time. This is worse than them continuously putting out all the sub par Halloween sequels.
this looks Bakkwaas movie ..... same bakwaaseeyaat
"I won't sleep until he's in the ground" Are you sure about that?
Is it weird that I want Dewey to be the killer??!
I like how Ghostface says, “you wanna play a game?” That makes me think of Saw. Also I don’t watch horror movies but I do like looking up the lore of the horror villains
I love how old days villain killers were met with knives sticks folks brooms even running DOWN killer with car !!! TODAY Slasher films  "YOU GOT A GUN" 😂😂
Shes still beautiful...nothings changed!!!
Remake of old movie 🎥 that's nice Reminds me of Drew Barrymore
Like the bogeyman himself, Hollywood franchises never die.
That's how bad movies are getting now days. They remaking and doing sequels to all the ones from my childhood.
Lets Go!!!! Sidney it’s an honor!! Classic never die can’t wait for the movie Wes craven the legend of horror movies 🎃☠️👻RIP
These trailers are really more fun to watch, when you can turn down the volume and play your favorite music, to go with it.
Disappointed with Ghostface's voice.. its kinda like that of Jigsaw's.. that iconic original voice of ghostface is defenitely not there
Halloween Kills is on now. Scream has a trailer now.  Me: * *Sad Friday The 13th noises.* *
This is what I’ve been waiting for!!!!
Finally
Yooooo it’s coming on my birthday 😁❤️🔥 Cool gift
A new scream movie!? It must be the second coming of Christ
WHO is the killer?😅
Who the fk picks up the landline phone in 2021? Its most likely marketing calls anyway 😂
Oh my God 😲🤯
Please let dylan minnette be the killer
Who else thought this was a full reboot before seeing Sydney?
YOOOOO
Now its in Call of duty🙂
YESSSS!!! I’ve been waiting for this moment to watch the trailer, so excited for the movie!
i hate jenna ortega. ugh why do they cast disney actors trying to be different..
Why there isn't any comedy element. Wasn't the old scream movies full of laughter?
stop making this shit
Why… did you open the door…
I really hope stu comes back as the killer
Bruh, just call it Scream 5
Wow amazing cant wait
A big no to automation for home security...
Wow first Halloween 🎃 and now Scream 💀....these are my favorite Series I have watched Halloween kills and it was awesome now can't wait to see Scream.....
If the attacks are on on people related to the original killers, I'm thinking they're all trying to kill Sydney. They are all taking turns playing ghostface.
Where’s Doofee?
Damn, all the old slashers really coming back!
i really can't wait this was my entire life as a teen and it's my fav horror movie serie eveeer
Omg,scream is my favorit movie ever
Glad clay jensen is here 🤣
0:26 I said "Run B*tch Run" - Shorty
Another reboot bullsh*t. They really can't  leave anything alone  I know what's pulled all these people back... A quick cash grab
I can tell this movie is shit without seeing it.
Looks shite
What’s upppppppppppp
Wasn't scream the the title of the 1st movie? Shouldn't this be called something else? Like Scream : legacy or some crap
Scream 😱 > 🎃 Halloween Kills 🍿📺
Ghostface seems more sinister in this one...im in! Well...gonna go binge watch the others now lol
Looks like it will be as boring as the last Halloween Kills movie. There are anything emotional from the actors when a kill happens in front of them. They mostly look they are in drugs.
They really gonna bring ghost face back I love it 😁
hope the story of who the killer is is as clever as the original and not a silly twist
Stu is alive!
Please call it something more than just "Scream". I hate it when they reuse the original name on sequels.
"Hello Sidney...It's an honour." Damn that line... amazing!
Scream: The Reunion
Respond to this post with who you think the killer is, assuming it's someone from the previous movies.
January horror? Now I am skeptical🙁
YOU CANNOT KILL DAVID ARQUETTE
Personally I say scream is the best slasher since u r always wondering who is wearing that costume and also he's more silent than myers
Wasnt  the girl's name Cindy , not Sidney
This movie looks epic, the first movie was amazing, can’t wait for this one!!!
another scream? then we need another scary movie right after this
Dylan Minnette !!
can't wait
MONICAA!!
Neve Campbell is awesome
WAZAAAAP!!!
screm
All the Scream movies haven’t disappointed me. Scream is defiantly my favorite of all the slashers. Looking forward to this one.
I think this ghostface is Stu. Matthew Lillard is on the casting list. It’s gonna be like it was in the first film, where there were two ghost face’s.
Stop destroying good movies 😂😂
WASUUUUUP
Ive realised the girl with fuzzy hair is from Spider Man: Miles Morales
Always takes me back to the 90s
ok I say NO
Nice to see Parody of scary movies.
Where's Office Dewy??????
only here for sid HAHHA
I know what u did last summer coming I bet.
It’s everything I didn’t want and more, thank you Paramount for stomping on Wes Craven’s grave even harder than I thought. I have 0 hope for this movie
😃I have been waiting for this so long and finally we got this...i'm so excited. neve and  courtny are back together and this will be so much fun.
i feel like this is going to be a lot darker and more serious, which is cool, but also a massive shame. scream is a horror COMEDY series at heart. hope there is some meta humour Somewhere
BRO WHERE JASON ITS  BEEN A DECADE
The. Scream.  Morives. Okey goodbyes bye marvel.   Or.  Raunday.  Jariume.  Kenney.   Ooo ya hi.  Marvel.    Safe.  Good. Job.    Marvel. Faruinds     Taritcket.   Money.    Marvel. Gavie.   Bye.  Fauinds.
Wow,Courtney cox .can't wait
It has to finally be Dewey. Has to be. Some how.
We need a new Friday the 13th movie 🎬
Stop rehashing this old crap these movie sucked ass
Im getting the feeling this one is gonna be ALOT darker 👀 then the previous ones, we’re definitely not READY for this😂🔥
I think this ghost face identity is: Who made those lemon squares for Dewey?
I know it’s a longshot but I hope there’s an Easter egg of ghost face imitating the dead by daylight Mori kill
The fact that we getting another scream movie is absolutely amazing and I love the OG attire I kind of wished they went with new outfit  something similar to dead by daylight version  of ghost face but still I have no issue with this one
Abt time omg
Anyone else not watching this because Wes Craven is missing??? I watched the trailer waiting for Halloween Kills And I dont like it But even before that I just automatically said  No Wes Craven  No movie Anybody else feel the same???
Awesome, can't wait!!!
Awesome, can't wait!!!
WHAT where did this come from I didn't even know this was happening
I bet the killer (or at least one of the killers) is Dewey.
I liked how scary movie poked fun at the scream movies and btw,I think the 4th one was the best one,so how are they going to top that?with its great acting,amazing sound effects and music, and most of all,ITS AMAZING KILLS
I think that 2018’s Halloween being a success lead to this being made, but it also gave something for the writers to work with— a new era of horror/slasher movies that keeps the central idea of slashers but has to do something different in order to captivate audiences, something more character driven. Scream at its core is an analysis/commentary of each horror era’s tropes— like Scream 4 using the “reboot” rules. Bet me money they mention 2018 Halloween in a scene while figuring out what this era’s rules are.
Looks bomb
Found this by accident.. can't wait
Damn you damn you damn you  It's just a trailer but I ...😱😱😱😱
Bruh. I almost choked on my hot chocolate the house phone from the beginning of this trailer is the same one as our house phone…
Dewey dies I'm calling it... That slow mo shot of Gale screaming and someone holding her back. 😬
Hoping it's a mild PG-13 rating so I can take the kiddos & baby
Who the fucks has a landline in 2021 though?
Can’t wait
January movie  Gonna suck Dems da rules
i am so glad that they have the original cast!
I LOVE the tone of this so far. Seems a bit darker than some of the other sequels, but, beware that there are a few misdirects in this trailer and the new creators (in honor of Wes Craven) threw in many different twists and turns. Whatever "easter eggs" you think you see in this trailer, you can forget it!!
"NAME THE FIRST VICTIM IN THE FIRST EVER STAB MOVIE?"  "CASEY! CASEY! CASEY BECKER"  "WRONG ANSWER!"  "I SAVE THE MOVIE 20 TIMES! ITS CASEY BECKER! DREW BARRYMORE PLAYED THE PART!" " THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE KNOWN  STEVE, CASEY'S BOYFRIEND, WAS KILLED BEFORE HER." "YOU TRICKED ME"   THIS SHOULD BE  IN THE SCRIPT!
bOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO   doOO DOOOO
HELL YEAH!! I HECKIN LOVE SCREAM!!! I HOPE THEY KEEP MAKING THIS MOVIE EVERY YEAR AND FOREVER!!
The fact that this isn’t a reboot or remake but just a refresh of an already amazing slasher franchise in memory of Wes Craven is what gets to me. Hope they make him proud and do him justice❤️❤️🔪
Scary movie ruined this scary mf for me....
I’m screaming!!!! I’m so hyped!!!!! I can’t wait omg!!
this trailer is so goood
Am i the only one wondering why she would open the door😑
This makes me cream my pants.  Takes me all the way back in the day to '96!!!
Isn’t that the stuck in the middle kid😂
God
I think it’s the boyfriend I mean just look how tall the killer is then look at him
I'm predicting the killer is Dylan Minnette from today!
All right Ghost Face is back, hopefully this time he can finally finish off Sydney
This movie gonna be nice but it’s played out all you would need is a gun lol problems solved
Looks like they're gonna kill off Dewey, if so, I'll stab the movie screen! Dewey is the heart and soul of these movies.
wassuuuuuuuuup
Omg just reboot scream...
I can smell the costume now
Looks cool but the concept of the old survivor coming back and being badass is getting annoying- like we’ve seen it in nightmare on elm street, terminator, halloween, but hey I’m sure it’ll be fun at least
I hope the Wayne brothers remake this one too🤪
he's so hot tbh
I hope dead meat makes a kill count about this.
I hope there's a lot of comedy like the rest
Finally bruh but they took an L not making the “S” a “5” in the title name 😂
Courtney Cox used to be hot as hell. Why did she have ruin her self with plastic surgery. Her face and mouth have completely changed.
Goosebumps right now. Memories flooding my brain. Cant wait for this
Courtney Cox looks a bag of damp cement. Opening scene was a parody of the original with a twist of "ooh look how more hip and with it we are with smart locks and iphones" the sheeple will get whats coming to them in this movie 🎥
Here’s what I think and I may be wrong. The scream ending of 1996 ended off with a TV being dropped or face flat on stu’s head, with deep stab wounds. Now, I feel some way Stu indeed survived and when cops arrived at the end when Gale was giving her report, Stu was in the ambulance. What happened next? I mean he did murder his fellow high school friends and was manipulated by another psycho path, but I feel just like he said to Sydney, “Peer pressure, I’m far too sensitive” is exactly what he told the cops at the station or whatever. He put it all on Billy. And it’s insane to see his house in this trailer. Just gives another clue. Do I believe they would make him the killer again? Maybe. It would be a big twist for sure I’m just so anxious to see this movie. Stu 25 years later…  Edit: “My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at meeee” -Stu. Now think about this, what if Stu’s father is the new killer along with the mother? That would be another great twist.
Damn....I really got old when SCREAM came out fucking 25 (!!!) years ago.
Who else can’t take scream seriously all I hear when I see him is “Wassssszaaaaaap” 😂
*Remember me?*
shorty "yo?" scream "hello,shorty..what are you doing?" shorty "good,watching the game smoke some bud (weed)" scream "are you are alone?" Waaaaaaasssaaaappppppp!!!!! scream "who is that?" shorty "yo,pick up the phone..wasssaaaaaappppppp!!!!" hahahaha!!best scene in scary movie 2000 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sidney Prescott the killer.
THE SUSPENSE OMG
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏I am helpless. Please stay by my side  Never worry about numbers.  Help one person at a time and always start with the person next to you.🙏🙏🙏🙏
This has Halloween vibes
Stu's house!????????
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
My theory for Scream 5: it will be sidney or something dumb like Dewey. Just to screw over the fans.
Unfortunately , scary movie killed this scream franchise to the point my generation literally can’t take it seriously.
What if scream teamed up with Jason and Michael myers
Plz tell me scream dies in the movie
Scary movie made me not scared of this guy anymore.
😈😈😈😈😈
1:24 WALLOWS
Wow, they really stuck to their roots. I legit got scared of this trailer and most horror trailers Don't scare me much.
this is a bit sad, they didn't renew scream 5 after scream 4 and then the director wes craven passed away. and now we get one where the first line of the trailer is from saw not scream?! wtaf
AHHHHHHHH, never watched scream just thought that was the theme AHAHAHAH LOL
dang neve looks good. cant say much for courtney
Omg how many of these movies are they going to make 🤔🙄
no more Dimension Films either :(
It’s Officer Doofy!! 🤣🤣
What has Courtney Cox done to herself, really no need...
OMG
Holloween Chucky and now ghostface lets goooo
Looks much better than the new Halloween movies.
The killer, or, one of the killer’s in this one is more ruthless. Stepping on ppls ankles like that? Jesus Christ. Can’t wait!!
Loving that the original cast is back. Ghostface looks as awesome as ever in this new decade. I missed these movies. Just wish they had a different title, instead of recycling a pre used one.
Yay can't wait!
Ya se a dónde irá mi beca
Que fuerte estaba Sidney 20 años atrás
Im one of tge biggst Scream franchise fans but I've had enough with this new generation trying to take over old successful franchises with look alikes and "family members" of the old cast etc. Kiss my ass Hollywood
Theory: Ghostface in this movie will be revealed to be Stu. In scream 1 it was never confirmed if the shock killed him and if you noticed Matthew Lillard has a cameo appearence in the background of each movie apart from Scream 3 where archive footage of him as stu was used for a flashback sequence. What if these cameo are retconed in this movie to be Stu stalking Sidney for all these years ploting his ultimate revenge, after all we do return to Stu's house.
Oh my gosh😬😍
This movie is going to blow, considering it’s releasing in January already puts it in the bad, it’s gonna be a fail.
I wonder if they plan any sequels… i don‘t want sidney to die but I‘m kind of bored by the never ending sidney the survivor thing. I love sidney but I think this story needs a reinvention without her. I don‘t want her to be the next killer though, maybe she just needs to die 😂
Boring and played out.
The producer said it's coming out next month though https://youtu.be/P-ZrOzEqLTI
Rest In Peace Wes Craven :(
Why is the voice not Roger Jackson??? It sounds awfulllll.
(Answers the phone . .)  Ghostface: WAZZZUPPPPPPP
why not release this in october near halloween
plot twist: sidney is the killer
Nothing Beats The Scary Movie Version Tho. WASSSSSSSUP!!!!
It’s stu
Nev Campbell and David Arquette .. love that the originals are in this movie! 🙌🏽  I will definitely be going to see it!
Definitely should've been stylized as "5cream" for the film's title. Very much indeed a missed opportunity especially when it was already a sort of tradition to have the numbers stylized within each of the sequels in the series pretty much anyway! 🤨🙄🤦🏽‍♂️.
All the scream movies had a "ghostface" killer that was seeking some form of revenge or were pissed off about something. I wonder if they're going to change that.
Sooo spooky!!!!
I'm hoping at the end of this series it ends with Sydneys death
Damn… didn’t think they’d kill Jenna Ortega off that quickly in the film, they almost showed her death in the trailer
Wait... What's Clay Jensen doing here? 🤔
Mr. Ballen brought me here...
Would you like to play a game? quite familiar sentence used by jigsaw
Scream 2022: have to whatsapp them to answer the house phone.
My number one favorite movie serial killer.
Great, another shit reboot... Well, at least I know what to save my money on next.
How is this horror?
Call of duty black ops Cold War Halloween 🎃 is Update is tomorrow
It's all fun and games until the serial killer can electronically unlock all your doors.
Neve❤
I think Courtney Cox can now give Ghost Face a run for his money on who has the scariest face !
This looks terrible. Like a TV episode.
Sidney's cousin being the killer in Scream 4 ruined this franchise and turned it into a complete fucking joke. Who's the killer in this one Sidney's old neighbour/grandma?
is that first house Nancy Thompsons house in the original Nightmare On Elm Street?
Mid January??  Release it this month....  makes way more sense
Hmm I’m surprised this movie is coming January, it would have been perfect for Halloween 🤷🏽‍♀️
As soon as she said “I’m Sidney Prescott” my heart stopped
Shit looks fire
Classic!!! Used to give me nightmares
Copy of Scary Movie 1 but a bit darker version.
First Michael myers return and now ghostafce 🔥🔥
This genuinely looks worse than generic and terrible. Halloween kills was worse but this looks bad.
Mom said that when I wear this badge you're supposed to treat me like a man of the law.
Oh I can't wait
that 13 reasons why guy seems sus to me
mee .... Sus sus sus....everyone sus....except camera man
im just wondering how many sales....do samsung make after sponsoring whole cast ?
I'm not sure about this one...
Boy, ain’t no way boy. They really gonna have Scream in the movies🤨🤨🤨 🎥??!🔪
Lessgo
They should do a "Halloween Kills Scream".
2.00 Gail finds out about Dewey. 2.02 Dewey looks like he's dead. Connection to all of them? I was going to say Sidney's dad but It's a reboot so who knows.
I am waiting for the Wayans brother to appear in this one :D:D:D
Its 2022 we still got house phones.
#HellYeah
I can’t express how happy and EXCITED I AM FOR THIS 😭😭😭 I love all the scream movies
YOOO come up with new movies you guys are trash
This is just a cashgrab, no need for this
NOOOOOO THEY DID NOT DO SIDNEY JUSTICE WTF😭😭😭😭
Must be losing material because they constantly recreating the same movies just leave the movies alone my goodness
GOOSEBUMPS
next trailer to come out... I STILL...STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID 50 SUMMERS AGO.
Why.
Does Neve Campbell even age!?!
COME ON!!!!
The movie no one asked for
oh wow another remake...
he won't kill anybody unless you invite him to a party with a pack of weed just learn it from Shorty
1:32 "come here boi"
After wacthing scary movie i dont know who can be scared of this movie anymore 😂
I was sooooooo waiting for Courtney Cox 😍😍😍😍😍
this film looks quite scary leh.
who’s screm
Sydney Presscot ❤
Scream and Halloween Kills bringing it back to the original characters and those connected to them, so smart
WTF but they already made a reboot with the original cast in the last movie, what is this, a reboot of the reboot? XD
Love it. Only thing I hate is we gotta wait until January 😱
The first time with no sparkle robe. In 4 the sparkles were there but they were more subtle, but that could’ve just been because of the coloring tones of the film that were there to represent the era of remakes which was almost always known to have a similar color motif. It’ll take time to get used to.
I think this film goooood not bad
Why? Hollywood that boring now? NO original ideas anymore? Your generation is so weak.
Ellie from. "YOU" 😄
DolbyON
Yawn
This is going to be so good, I can already tell!!!
yessirrrrrrr i been waiting for years
Hello Sidney... that never gets old 💯
Why did the trailer come out on october this is so disappointing
The ghostface returns💀💀
Hahah the last movie neve Campbell did was scream like 20 years ago. She’s been hanging out for this paychexk for a long time
Wazzuuup
Is this a reboot
if you watching this movie at cinema please get a mute mic to your headphones
old school is back
man they are really running out of ideas for movies.
why change the voice though
Now someone get back directors from Scary Movie and do a comeback aswell
Bruhhh😂😂😂 Fr doing all the wrong things
Way to go paramount 🎃🔪🔪
bruh why does jenna ortega have to be in the opening death scene😭😭
Thats a lot of spoilers in a trailer
Let’s see if this is better than Halloween kills cause fuck the people on that movie were idiots 🤦🏾‍♂️
Crap
Remake?
i grew up on the scream movies!!! love this alot
Please don’t let dewy die, he’s such a good character!!
Takes me back to 1997 (or so) when I was 9 and watched this movie for the first time.
The scream movies are my favorite horror films so I'm very excited to see how this one is.
I lost the ability to take scream mask seriously after scary movie.  WASUUUUUUUP
If they kill Sydney Gail or Dewey i literally want nothing to do with this mess. 😭🤣  But I feel like that HAVE to kill one of them at this point. 😭😭😭
ghostface is probably the coolest looking horror character
So I'm guessing this is scream 5 I bet then
Why she even went to the door and opened it
Finally is back scream after the scream 4 was out it was no more till next year wow
So cringe....
OMG👁️👄👁️
TANGINAAAA. WELCOME BACK, SIDNEY!!!
Finally🥳🥳
Yessss
Scream 5 hell yea
HYPE!
Eh
Damn I’m getting old
And my final comment on this gem, keep em coming, 4 incredible films so far, thank you  to the main three for keeping this franchise alive!
Ok I’m putting in my prediction, Randy’s sister is the killer😲
Na Expectativa!!! ;D
Umm is this real??
I’m not a fan of scary movies. I remember when this came out I decided to watch this with my mother. When it was over I looked at her and said “holly 💩 I like a scary movie.” I’m pumped to watch Sydney kick A$$.
Why do they always kill Dewey 😭
My God the most famous horror movie in history scream has been back it’s gonna be scary as hell I want to get to help with self
Wes Craven isn’t here to direct this one, hopefully they do it justice
I mean.. don’t get me wrong i like “scream” but this trailer kind of made me cringe. Why include the original actors? Why not restart the whole series and remake it to appeal to the newer audience? I mean you already have ghost face hacking shit..
HELL YES. This just made my day
They are missing some piece in the movie!! And that piece is the Wayan’s Brothers
Looks awesome! But really…. January? Lame ass release date.😐
Damn! So has anyone else Googled the cast? I kind of spoiled the surprise for myself.  Spoilers:  Matthew Lillard and Emma Roberts are credited. Might just be flashbacks.
Got chills when he said "Hello Sidney  It's an honor"
reminds me of the final girls support group
Personal this movies looks kinda ass I would much rather prefer to scream 3 💀💀
Can't wait to see Sydney & ghost face fight with eachother.
Does that mean we get a new Scary Movie within a few years? 😂
Scream 5 here I come🤩 finally coming soon🤟🏼
Why did you open the door !!!
This really doesn't seem characteristic to the franchise. I can already see this going down like the Nightmare on Elmstreet remake...
The moral of the story is always use manual locks
Hope it’s better then Halloween kills
Lowkey hyped for this. Was not expecting that!!
Gail swallows!
*First Halloween, now Scream. Thanks for that*
after watching scary movie.. watching scream is just another comedy for me.. this too..
Yessss! It's not a remake!!! And it looks good.
The beginning of the trailer couldn't have been more stupid. And why does this feel like a set-up for a new Scream franchise?
Does the killer end up being their plastic surgeon?
Oh....it's  definitely an honor...and honor to see this remake come January.
They better not mess this up!!!
letsgoooo
This couldn’t have been released in October? Come on!
The movie  is already  leak on internet
I. Had. No. Idea. My first time seeing the trailer and so happy it comes out sooner than later. I LOVE this series. Top 3 favorite. First candyman then Halloween now scream? I'm so excited.
🛐
DYLAN MINETTE DYLAN MINETTE DYLAN DYLAN AIKCSUINKIEFHOZEHCIAEIEOHC
Nice
Sidney got more lives than Michael Myers
The killer is going to be Gale. Remember she has always hated the fact that Sidney blamed her for believing that cotton didn’t murder her mother. She was also smacked up several times by her. Her husband is also overprotective of Sidney, which could make her jealous. Also the fact that her writing career has been suffering and in her being the killer, she would win all kinds of awards and go out being captured in style
EXCELENTE, FALTA QUE APAREZCA TAMBIEN EMMA ROBERTS ,
finally have something to look forward to scream being my favorite slasher including the tv series
Halloween 🎃 right mattressI like those ghost face, and likes Candyman too. And like villains.
Hello Sidney, it's an honor
Why do they stay in this damn town if he keeps doing this shit? I feel the same way about people in tornado alley- move to Arkansas or Tennessee and cut the shit!!!
I’m so excited! 👏
Hell yea, you can always rely on scream to keep shit real. This trailer makes that terrible halloween kills movie look like dog piss. Cant wait to see what wes brings to the series next. Good ol ghost face is back to keep horror actual horror. Show neo fascist hollywood how its done!
It’s either going to be a girl as the killer or three girls. Predictable predictable predictable.
Perfect trailer for Halloween Kills in the theater.
Scream 5 it takes place after events of scream 4 I saw all scream movies I have original ghostface mask
Seriously someone has landline nowadays lol?! 👻
I watched scream 1 to 4 this sunday because of this lol
I mean…….. do you like scary movies?
We never really did see Stu die…..tho this could also have some connection to Randy….maybe his sister who appeared briefly in Scream 3…
Should have just rebranded it as "The Scream"
OMFG
Kesini gara gara ada yang terinspirasi ngebunuh
I feel 25 yrs younger - hell ya
Do we need to see all movies to understand this one?
I wanna see this.
*Wazzzzap*
Omg they should just have stopped at the last one years ago. Trying too hard now. They should know when to call it quits
I just hope that Stu has something to do with all the things happening
Omg, so exited!
Neve campbell is still hot as hell...what a beauty!
What a missed opportunity to title this “5cream.”
FREAK YES!!!!!! 💀🕸🎃
Calling it now. It's Stu's son.
I’m excited to learn who the killer is and what the connection is! This looks amazing
Get some imagination and STOP REMAKING OLD MOVIES
I can’t waittttttt
Dewie is the/one of the killers. Calling it now.
Why couldn't they have just called it Scream 5
This looks like a ghostface that isn’t messing around
MY CHILDHOOD IS BAAAAACCCKCKWKOSJRODDJKDKEKDKF
The Scream franchise is my favorite! I can't wait for this new one!
I'm sorry but because of Scary Movie I just laugh when I see the Scream mask lol
Hopefully Scary Movie reboots as well
Bring it on. So fkn ready for this one. 🍿Bringing it back to the beginning ♥️
Love these movies but I’ll never get over how they killed Randy, he’s my all time favorite scary movie character
Evil dies tonight
The trailer makes me feel like I've watched the entire film already 😐 I think the trailer showed too much personally but I'll still watch as I love the originals
we’ve been waiting for THIS!
YESS!!!!!!
Hell yeah… but you can’t just call it Scream again can you? Lol
Sidney Prescott is back y'all!!!!
wassuuuupppp
Bruhhhhhhhhh
you like to play game? WASUPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
RIP Wes Craven!
I have this mask lol
Neve Campbell 😍 Oh Lord I grew up with her
Omggggg
Among us the movie
Landlines in 2022 lol
the thing goes skkrraahhh pop pop pop pop pop
Where’s joe when you need him, he promised to keep Ellie Safe
"I'm Sydney Prescott of course I have a gun" - super mega cringe master level achieved!
Come on Dewey as the killer!!!
Sidney: *walks into Stu’s house*  Ghostface: “Why do I hear boss music?”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
This looks so good, ...... can't wait for it shame it doesn't come out now to go with the spooky halloween vibe 🤪 💀 😜
Looks bad and uninteresting. Feels like they're just playing off of what Halloween 2018 did with their series.
We are back in Stu Macher’s house....could that mean something? Omg this is killing me, I want January to come! 😭😭
10 år senare
We get Halloween 🎃 & scream 5 back to back! What a time for horror fans and then halloween ends oct 2022, & the new leather face movie is in the works
Dylan Minnette is in the movie, yey
Is this DBD's Danny Johnson !!!
TF is this shit? Not even close to be a part of serial of the Scream. Another bullshit movie.
Remake this, reboot that. Hollywood is completely out of idea’s 🥱
"I'M IN THE HOOOOUSE."
god i hope it’s good😩 my favorite scary movies 4ever
What if you did? What if you lied? What if I avenge? What if eye for an eye?
These fools made the exact same damn movie over again with the same people and everything, amazing.
This looks like it’s going to more than make up for the cheesiness/campiness of Scream 4.
nostalgic horror...Nice making... Definitely on my watchlist.
This is the first time I’m actually scared of ghost face, he seems more like a unstoppable killer and less do a guy flailing his arms
https://youtu.be/3Wy_X2WzxwA 🎥🎥🔥
nothing beats the scream 1996 😎 classic
GHOSTFACE IS BACK!!!!
“Wouldn’t You LIKE To Play A ‘GAME’, Terra?”
I’m in the house
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Scream 5!!
Calling it now! Sidney is the killer, maybe all 3 original characters are but definitely her. You can come back here in a few months and call me Nostradamus :)
Wazzup?
At 1:35. Looks like stu’s old house. Hmmmmm. Wonder what is going on with that
That unnecessary hair flick at 1:44 was fucking CRINGEY! Still though, can't wait for this. :D Halloween Kills is great btw. Deliciously gory!
Looks like Paramount has totally forgotten that they have "Top Gun" which is yet to be released.
ready to not sleep for a month
i cannot wait
I've been waiting for this ever since scre4m came out
One of the best horror series ever. I’m so excited for this.
Dewey is the killer
Yes
David Arquette im in
Can't wait!!! :)
That scream from Mr. Bean's episode 1:33
I’d just spontaneously leave town cross the country
OMFG YES!!!! THANK YOU
1:50 looking like monica gelar
This is actually bullshit scream 4 was bad enough
Great first they ruined the Halloween franchise now scream wtf
i love how they had a similar opening to the first scream by having a big star being killed off drew barrymore to jenna ortega
Why? Just why?
it reminds me scary movie 😂😂
"Whatever his link is to our past" "And I won't sleep until he's in the ground"  If I learned anything from Scre4m, it's that the killer is not always a HE.  This looks interesting. Very original Scream vibe to it.    P.s. That audio at 1:34 gave me chills!!!!
Wasss up 😂😂😂😂😂😂
best movie! ❤️✨
I get to relive the 90’s again with these actors!
oh my god!!! I can't wait, I loved the series so much.
Let's all take a moment to thank and remember Wes Craven for creating all this, may he rest peacefully.
i can’t take scream serious after the parody movies it’s stoned into my head 😂
This has great potential for failure, but I’m still gonna watch it
So hyped for this can’t wait!
Looks fucking brutal
missing drew berrymore....
Sydney is the killer.
Now if they can just bring back a nightmare on elm street and Friday the 13th
If it isn’t Stu I’m probably gonna cry.
This is good
this is finale?
A random caller: Would you like to play a game?  Jigsaw: _Hey! That’s my line!_
Billy Loomis' little brother?
yes 90´s era is back!!!  fack tik tik generation !!!
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Shit looos bullshit no cap 😭
Yo a movie serial killer finally runs on scream
Wow Fabulous  Waiting  💟💟❤❤💞💞😱😱😱😱😱😱👌👌👌👌👏👏👏👏👏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
this better be good
Old school ❤️
I jumped and started dancing when I heard "Hello, Sidney"
I’m so hyped!    I’m also dating this comment 10/17/21
January?? Weak
Scary Movie needs to be remade at this point
The shot of Gale at around the 2:00 mark says “Dewey just died” to me.
Scream 3 was a perfect way to end this, it all made sense. But now whose the killer in this one? Mickey's cousin? C'mon now🤦🏿‍♀️🤦🏿‍♀️
Some really exciting movies coming out at last.
such a well done trailer
Uh oh! Stu Macher’s house is in the OFFICIAL trailer! I. Can’t. Wait!
I swear, if dewy dies I’m suing!
GIRLS ITS AN HONOUR BABE!! 😉
I hope they give dewy an actual fight scene this time and not just have him get fucked up before he has a chance to do anything like always.
Stu?
Running out of ideas lol
We want SCARY MOVIE's sequel...
Based off the quick scene at 2:00 minutes in I think Dewey might die...
I’m Sooo excited for this movie best movies scream 1 is the best of all buut all the scream movie is good 👍
Plot twist Angie (the original 2nd killer) is back
I think its Dylan Minette
The Wayan Brothers ruined Scream for me. 😂🤦🏼‍♂️
10 million views..great job 👍😃
Finally
Pick up the phone... WAZZAAAA
LETS GO JACK QUAD
Can't wait to see it😍😍😍😍
If this is on the same level as part 2 or 4 I'm perfectly fine, just don't let it be like the mess called "Scream 3".
Oh nah. This one a savage.. stomping on ppl legs and shii. Ellie where Joe got you hiding?
Wasssssssssss up
I CANT FUCKING WAIT HOLY SHIT IM EXCITED
I was wondering if they were going give Courtney the dodgey bangs again lol 🔪💀
THESE WERE MY CHILDHOOD LETS GOOO
Let's do this !!🔥🔥🔥
I feel like this a pathetically predictable entry that will serve as nothing more than a means to kill of series regulars, Neve Campbell, David Arquette, and Courtney Cox, just to make room for the next generation because the next generation doesn’t have a single, creative, original bone in its entire body. I mean, look what they did with Star Wars.
Although I love courtney Cox and David arquette... I think they are going to die in this film... But I am going to miss them if they are going to do scream 6
Can't wait... Love all scream movies
Scream 2022: Reveals Trailer Behaviour: So hey you know how we claimed the mask license and not the scream one-
There's been some talk as to whether the TV actually killed Shaggy.
Bollywood is going to copy this soon.
“It’s an honor”
Sidney will survive again. As always. :)
Finally sidneys carrying a gun
Seeing Courtney in a horror/thriller movie rather than a comedy show is wierd yet she looks so fit for it🙂 it's gonna be fun😍
Missed opportunity to call it "5CREAM"
Hopefully it’s Mathew lilard
BRO I CANNOT WAIT
This better be funny like the previous movies!
where will this show?
The beginning was like a chad sketch from SNL minus the chad-ness then it turned into the OG scream shit
Jesus Christ is the Way, the Truth, the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Him. There is no other intermediary. May Jesus Bless you, trust Him, give your life - and He will take care of it :pray, Convert yourself and believe in the gospel.♡♡
I’d love to see ghost face draw his kills out for longer and toy with his victims like the first movie. Like with Casey in the opening he calls her and just talks with her for a while before the conversation turns sinister
Its 2022 , people dont use telephones no more
You poor thing.
Those movies were interested to watch.    I got idea for a movie.   It called. Truth and Justice Like a Rat.   It would be about a crook mayor is helping mobster. They don't like this woman do they set out to frame her,. Some of the things they do is set up people be to lie   an d cops deleted videos cameras footage in order to frame her.   One of the frame up is she has painting that she painted,. Do crooked mayor wants the mobs with her painting that she painted.   People being paid to lie and deleted videos cameras footage.  Then they want to arrest her in secret.   So nobody will know the truth,. A huge cover up
I just wanted to here 1 what's your favorite scary movie
10 million yaya
Shaggy is Ghost face
Are they trying to create a slasher universe with all these recent comebacks?
Ghostface seems more serious and not playing around than the previous ones. January can’t get here soon enough!
Should've asked her what her favorite scary movie was.
Yo I thought jenna Ortega was gonna be a part of the main cast
+what?
Another Scream movie? I wasn't really a fan of the series but I guess this one looks good.
Is that stu’s house from the first movie?
wwaaaassuuup
My favorite slasher character and the trauma of my childhood. This gonna be epic!
have automatic doors they said
This series always had potential but got worse every movie
I think mfs forget ghost face is a regular dude with a knife😭😭😭
Scream and saw changed the horror genre for the better when their first movies released glad to see GF back on our screens
I AM SOOO Gonna Watch This
Why isn't it titled Scream 5?
Look terrible like all the rest... IM SOLD
do you like scary movies?
This series could go on forever… I think this time it would be best to get Sideny killed.
Wouldn't it be so cool to have ZENDAYA as the first kill or a cast member that we have not seen before. Not included yet in the cast roster. Or Taissa Farmiga or a GUY! Noah Centineo or just some Hot Guy in the shower like MARION CRANE in PSYCHO! HAHAHA
Kevin Williamson and Roger L Jackson are stamps in American Horror Film Culture and cornerstones of this very franchise.  "We're not finished yet!"
no way they killed my girl in the first scene
Looks awful
Damn I didn't think they were gonna make another scream movie
Please upload Tamil language trailer
Hold up now take a vote Sidney  for scream or Jamie's for hollaween
Please be better than Halloween kills 😬🥰
Jenna Ortega is outstanding though.
Whoever coined the shot at 0:49 needs a pay a raise this is the best “I’ve returned.” pose ever 😭
Reboot?? Awww yes those rulesss. LOL 😁 Smdh 🤔🤔 Ok i'm in. 🙂
RIP Wes Craven.....I hope the director for this one keeps up to the legendary directors vision....but looking at the trailer it looks absolutely awesome... can't wait for this one
DO YOU LIKE SCARY MOVIES!? 🤪
The screams just keep getting louder
💌💘💘💛🧡🧡❤❣💞🤎💗💗💗💗💓💓💞JESUS LOVES YALL 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕 💗 💓 💘 💖 ❤ 💕
It’s nice to see David play himself in this scream, and not the goofy dumbass cop of the other scream movies 😂
Finally he’s back
i cant take it serious idk why lmao i think its the mask it reminds me of being in the 4th grade
The fact theyre back at the party house where Tatum was killed is so epic!
Remember Kids…..  “You hang up the phone on me one more time *I’ll Gut you like a Fish* ”
so orignal actor's come back after so many year's to fight the same killer they survived oh so long ago hmm this reminds me of something *cough* halloween 2018 *cough* all jokes aside this looks awesome
Took y’all time , like 11 years …FINALLY
cant wait to watch the movie 100+ times lol
Pretty sure he’s using a buck 19. Noice.
WAZZZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP🤪
Scream way better than Mike Myers don't @ me
ICECREAM
Scream 5? Idk why they just called it scream like it's a remake
Ngl feels like HALOWEEN 2018
woah
Yayyyyy
Isn't this basically Scream 5?
sidney doesn't age at all
Damn Courtney’s face looks like it hurts… yikes 😂😂😂😩
Bro my bday is on the 15 of jan and it comes out on the 14 Im crying
This actually looks like they finally got a franchise reboot right. Can't wait!!!
I QUIT AT 1:01 ...OLD PRODUCT NEW PACKAGE (KIND OF)
Yes! So excited!
9.8 million views in four days.
Gale swallows!! 😂😂😂
The most serious of the whole series by far
Anyone else find the January release worrying?
Yasss
2:02 if you pause it, you can see the girl with Ghostfaces knife stabbing someone with a shirt brown hair, most likely a dude. Killer is either that girl or the guy with short hair. Sherlock Holmes out.
I literally screamed. LESSGOWWWWWWW!
Tara Die In Start Of The Trailer 👁️👄👁️
Wow....I wonder how much media can be regurgitated....It's like there is no creative thought anymore.
Ghostface: " would you like to play a game" Me: sure,  wanna play dead by daylight?
NO JENNA😭
Nobody uses landlines no more...🤣🤣🤣
Is this another Scary movie?? Sure looks like it 😀
Yaayy scream is back...🎉🎉🎉
WAZAAAAAAAAP
So does this mean we can get a Scary Movie remake
Random guy: "This movie can't be as good as the first one"  Ghostface: "Hold my knife !"
I love how Jenna is getting into a lot of new stuff now
i remember after i watched the scream movie i couldnt stand hearing the sound of the phone ringing i would be terrified i would run in my room and sit their waiting if scream would show up.
What the....are house phones still a thing anymore?? 🤔🤔
Here we go again
Is that Ellie!
I was hoping to see Jenna the whole movie
0:02 *Credit Rolls*
So excited! Especially since Sidney, Dewey, and Gale will be back!!
Lol. They got no more creativity? Only remake now?
killer is a person of color. i bet every single dollar i own. 4 straight movies with white killers? come on now. it's 2021, or will be 2022 rather.
Oh god  Sidney never is able to sleep eat or shit or anything til whom ever it is  Is dead …. Again.   Another redone played out version of the same old last 3 versions 😑🙄
Waaaaaaaaaaay better than Halloween kills.. if u haven’t seen it don’t it’s a waste of money 💰
I looove the play with the tech, landline-cell and the doors lock and unlock!  It should be in theaters at halloween not all the way in January...  looks great tho
MONICA
Why in January dumbest time
I sense a…disturbance…in the force. We will lose a character we love 😢
😱
Finally classic slashers scream was my childhood
Since it looks like Sidney isn't the target like she has been in the previous movies, I'm guessing this is some sort copycat who's an obsessed fan of the original murders trying to recreate them
A remake of a movie. How original
Whaaaack
*do you like scary movies*
Sidney is back
honestly looks like generic crap with no charm of the originals
Haven’t we had enough of these? And wasn’t this a parody of slashers? Feels like a serious one to me, boys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Writer: How many people should hate Sidney?  Director: Yes
theres a Scream every year how do people get excited for the same plot over and over and over again. I dont remember the last time I seen a Scream movie but dont plan on it
I honestly thought this was a commercial for something not a movie trailer…. Things changed so much 😩😩
The first girls acting is horrendous
Is that Stu's house?
HELL YES
WAZZZUUUUUUPPP 😜
So...Scream 5?
Gives me the creeps! I can’t wait 🙃
Nothing much just chilling killin
“Hello Sidney , it’s an honor”  SPINE TINGLING
Let’s go Paramount🦾
this mf wont be sacry bc every kid dresses up as him for halloween
Yesss!! So happy to see this!! I was gttn really hooked on scream the tv show too sme years bck but they took it off..so happy to look forward to this!
Just find another way to give Randy a cameo.
Yas
👀👀🙌🏼
she’s so badass in this
I hope it will be coming soon to the theaters
i just watched halloween kills last night i cant wait for this
I was hoping for WAAAAAZZZAAAAAAAP!!
Now you have a 🔫 gun
I LOVE THE SCREAM FRANCHISE!
They stuck with the original characters!!!! OMG!!! 😱 Yassss!!
My childhood !!! Wuzzzzaaaaaapppppp
scary movie looking different here
Looks a lot darker!  Can’t wait
Dooey is the killer,  sorry everyone
Omggfgg this looks so good! Gave me goosebumps
Yeah ahhhhhh
Lmao, imagine if it was Randy
The trailer scared the shit out of me
I hope it isn’t cheesy like the old movies
I love that the OG crew has been a part of all the movies
if this is the last installment of the franchise i feel like officer doowie give him self up for the greater good and end it with a bang
i prefer munch
scream 5 looks amazing can't wait for it!
so we’ve got scream, chucky and michael. Could we also get the hockey masked slayer back by any chance?
I’m happy Dylan is acting in this movie☺️
This is awesome!!!! Can’t wait! ESP the OGS!
January?!?!?!?
the only movie that i never get tired off seeing having another sequel.
This is so serious now
its gonna turn out to be a spirit/demon/malignant force is possessing people and making them do all the killings. Some like Brahms: The Boy II
I love Neve Campbell
I don't know why but Scream 4 is this movie for me that left an ambience, a feeling I remember, it just has an atmosphere, and so I will watch this and see if it has atmosphere too
Ghostface with a little coding skills
More like this janu-scary
It’s 2021 no one has a house phone any more.
i was hoping for a reboot to give the franchise a fresh stroy but i'm okay with this
Why...
Awesome!!! So gotta see this!!
My grandmother took me to see scream in 1996 when I was only 6 years old! I can’t WAIT to be back to see this one! So many memories
Would be better if the quality was mediocre 😂👌🏾
I wonder if they will off a main character in this one.  Not sure by the trailer who the killer could be in this one, I called it in 4 but right now, not sure. Roll on January
alright... now " i know what you did last summer (2022) ".
HELL YEAH!!!!
I’m glad to see Sidney, Dewey, and Gale back for this one. Scream has been a collection of great movies. None of them have been bad in my opinion so I’m looking forward to Scream 5.
REALLY??? 🤦🤦🤦🤦
That “ hello Sidney” brought back memories
Gale being held back gives me major they kill Dewey or Sydney vibes and i'm not okay.
I’m good off this lol
Scream series >>>>>>>>> Halloween series
cool doo
Another Rinse and repeat of all the previous movies 💤💤💤💤💤💤💤💤
YASSSS! scream has been one of my faves all these times and im excited to see this one
YYYYYYEEEEEEEESSSSSSS !!!!!
Can it please be Stu
It’s gotta be Stu.
Killer should have texted "You should have played the game." after she locked the doors.
I thought Kirby would be here :( ....
Can't wait for James A. Janisse
wasuuup
Cant wait
Oh damn, I'm not into horror movies, but this is the only franchise that I see and I really cannot wait for this new movie! Really happy to see the iconic characters back! YES!!! I am very excited!
I have a hunch that it might be Randy's sister and she has a good motive to kill. Also, she was seen with the cast at the beach on their instagram stories so it could be a possibility ¿?
It's 2021 and Dewey is using a revolver. It would definitely make more sense him being an ex-cop to be using something with a quicker reload
Yes scream is back 💪💪💪
When she asked Courtney are you ready for this and she said “For this? Never" they brought the original cast 🤔
Mixed feelings like the state of hip hop right now 😂💯
"What's your favourite scary movie"?😱
Its amazing
The revenge of the Sith with a tiny knife
I think the killer is Wes 🤧
Calling it now: the killer is Stu
Looks like Ghostface is now in the 21st Century. And I also miss Wes Craven RIP :-(
hanggang ngayon pandemic na hinahabol ka pa rin ng killer na yan? kawawa naman tong babae na to
Why don't you release the film 31st October Halloween .
Looking forward to this. Not sure about the new phone voice though.
stab 33 ?
Scream haloween they beck again
I'm ready for scary movie 😁
Cool trailer but C'mon now....🤣
It looks great,  more horror less comedy
I'm just disappointed I can only like this once!
STU's house?!!! Is Stu...alive? o.O
2021 - 2022 The era in which the characters from the classic movies finally fight back! Hoorah! ("Halloween Kills" for example)
"Would you like to play a game, Tara?"  Wait a minute... I thought this was a "Scream" trailer, not a "Saw" trailer. LOL
About damn time!
What’s your favorite scary movie
5CREAM? No?
Take my money !!!💰
AINT NO DAMN WAY SHE JUST OPENED HE DOOR WIDE OPEN
I was about to say "meh, another shitty reboot". And then, BOOM!! "I'm Sidney Prescott, of course i have a gun." Daaaaaammnnn grrrrlllll!!!
THE WAY I SCREAMED "CLAY JENSENNN"
As a 90s kid awww it's good 2 see the original cast!! I love it!
IAMMMM READYYYYYY AAAAAAAH
I’m sorry but there’s no other line more iconic than “Hello Sidney” in the Horror genre.
Can y’all let sidney live?? 😩😩 I’ll be watching tho 🍿 🔪
WAZUUUUUUUUUUP
I thought this was going to be a comedy.  Oops, I was wrong!  Scary trailer for sure!!!
Callin it now. It's Stu
Looking at Courtney Cox. Mr Plinkett : oh my god what happened to your face?????
this new movie looks so much darker than the other movies! i'm so excited for this omg!
Neve Campbell didn't age that much.
👏🏻👏🏻🪑🪑
The masked dude holds the knife like its a lightsaber, reminds me of Darth Nihilus
For the love of God ....some movies just shouldn't make a comeback and this is definitely 1!!!!!!
It's an honor...
Sidney Prescott hasn't aged!! My '90s heart. 🥺
looks so cool
We already know its Dylan behind the mask
Black person dies first.. glad scream bringing back old traditions
Who the hell still has a house phone?
.
1 guy = HAVIER RAVEZ. 2 hot asian girls = MARLIN PIE KYOHEDI LEDR & CEROBLAST. 1 hot white girl = DEB. Sitting in the tree :P HAHAHAH! OOPS HAVIER RAVEZ strive indeed :P
seeing gale and dewy again ZZZZZZZZZ something new for once fk my life.
Hello Sidney!  😈😱🔪
scream? really thats the name?
ザ•アメリカン映画って感じですこ
The power of money and nostalgia makes movies
i hope it still has humor in the dark scenes but still scary like the first couple ones thats why i liked it
Wish this made it for October
Dang this movie is gonna be SICK
I saw this as an ad and it looked interesting. I knew it was scream the second I heard the voice call 😩
is this real
INSANE WOW CANT WAIT
It’s a ghost from the past 100% think it is Stu Macher
I don't think I ever really liked any of these movies but I get excited every time there's a new one. ☺
THIS LOOKS REALLY BAD PEOPLE!!!
Fantatic just what we need a good slasher horror flick. Awesome can't wait 😁👏
1So Sidney burns 🔥 ghostface ( Sam Carpenter) in the finale in the original kitchen at Stu's house. Martha Meeks is the one holding back Gale Screaming as Dewey is brought out in a body bag. Jenna Ortega survives the opening kill however is killed in the hospital later and Dewey not long after as he is there to try and save her. Hicks is rushing to the hospital after she hears Dewey has been killed but ghostface has fucked with her breaks and she crashes and dies. Kyle Gallner's character is stabbed several times by ghostface and left dead beside a dumpster. Chad and Mindy Meeks are both killed during the party at Stu's house he is chased and stabbed outside as shown in the trailer and his sister in the garage a homage to Tatums death but very diffrent .  Liv McKenzie is killed after making love to her boyfriend before he is chased and killed eventually outside again a homage to Sidney and Billy love making scene. Finally Amber and Gale along with Sidney are the only two three left. Amber has a twist but ultimately dies she is stabbed multiple times very brutal. Gale has an amazing chase from ghostface hiding in the woods outside the house where she and Dewey found the Dads car in the original but is captured by Ghostface and bound and gagged and put in a ghostface costume. Sidney shoots her by mistake and takes of the mask to reveal Gale she tells her she will be with Dewey now and to end this fucker once and for all before dying. Final showdown between  Sidney and Ghostface oh wait did I miss someone out yeah 😅  there are three  ghostfaces Sam and wait for it yes you guessed right Richie Kirsch and Wes Hicks why did they do it well that part I wont spoil but nobody survives except one of the killers and Sidney finally meets her maker but how she goes is friggin amazing. Sue me Paramount  😘
So awesome they put the original cast in it 😩❤️
Theatre Or OTT ..?
sis better make sure that phone is fully charged
im so exciteeed
Ahhhhhh Wake me up on January 14. Thanks
WHY WOULD YOU OPEN THE DOOR!?
This actually looks more serious and darker than the original. They removed the comedy element so it's pure horror this time. Looks promising.
y’all really killed off jenna ortega that quickly
All we want is Dewy to survive, we don't want to see him dying, we love him since the day one
Courtney Cox still looking as gorgeous as ever I'm hyped for this
Releasing 2 days after my birthday 🎉 DAMN EXCITED!!!!! Big fan 😻😻😻
*its a horror film*
Scary Movie
so bassically, its Halloween, but the guy has a different mask on
LETS GO!!! These movies were my entire childhood!
This was filmed in my home town ahah gonna be crazy watching this
Whoaaaa
hoping skeet ulrich, matthew lillard and rose mcgowan still alive for un expected twist
why are they rebooting scream
Boring. Nothing will surpass the 1996 one
Ufffff 🤩🤩🤩
Ohh godd, I was so impatient that I wrote it's 5th & 6th part in 2019!!!  Can't wait for this! I hope part 6 will be mine story, as I've written. SCREAM, at your strength, no one's gonna help you.
I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS MOBIE THE OTHER DAY!!!!
CAN'T WAIT!
Nice
gayle swallows
Refreshing to see the ghost face mask
Scary movie 7 is coming
"I'll be right back."
WAAASSSSSUUPPPPPPP 😝😝😝
This looks like what the original would look without the meta
I love the first 3 Scream films but nothing about this trailer excited me at all.  Same old same old.
No Scream 5??🤦🏻‍♂️
NOW THIS IS A REAL FUCKIN SCREAM !!!! dark bloody i love it
IS THAT THE HOUSE FROM THE FIRST SCREAM!?
"5CREAM". There's your title and hashtag right there...
Is this a remake?
This a remake
not sure how i feel about these new actors and the whole “ its time to fight back” thing.. looks lame
I've never been a huge fan of slashers but i've always loved the Scream series. Neve Campbell's role as Sidney Prescott is awesome. I'm excited for this.
I hope it's better than Halloween (11)
Vanessa, let me get the next one! Vanessa, let me interject some! The way you sweat, the way you flex on the floor It makes me want you more!  🔪
I stg if one of the main characters (gale,dewey,sidney) dies I'm gonna off myself by choking on a piece of popcorn from shookness😏😂
It was already a shitty movie, let’s not make it worse, hate these cash-grabs.
My boy Clay Jensen is back!!!
WeLcome back oLd CasT 👍
I cannot wait. My favorite slasher of all time
KswaggReacts likes this!!!
Yes Roger Jackson! Best ghost face voice
Amazing how the killer is always someone different but the outfit is always they same.
Bring a knife to a gun  fight and still always win: Scream, Jason, Michael.
IM SCARED
Looking forward for the 5th Part of SCREAM 😱 movie franchise! This trailer brings back the terror and scream once again! 🖤  Lets get ready for a hell slasher ride! 🤯
We need somthing original and new always coming with these reboots
Neve Campbell is gorgeous
Hello Sidney whats your favourite scary movie?
1996,1997--2000----------2011----------2022. Took a fucking big leap. Everytime it came, it gave an unforgettable ride😌
IM SHOULD NOT BE THIS EXCITED OMFG
It's look good not before Rotten Tomatoes and imdb start comparing with the older Scream and get 45% from Rt and 2.5 star from imdb
Woooooooo
1:33 I love you 💗🔪
My theory. Billy had an affair with Judy Hicks. Her son is Wes Hicks. Why is she back? Wes Hicks is Billy’s son and he’s here to finish what his father started.
scream - must be like 80 years old - why is he still running around like hes in his 30s
No Wes Craven, no Scream. Byeee
I feel MTV Scream vibes in this trailer, god i really wanted season 3
Praise this movie for bringing Neve Campbelle back, the one and only Sidney Prescott ever since the original.   Reminds me of Jamie Lee Curtis being Laurie Strode for almost 40 years.
It's weird how there's no specific killer, it's just the costume that's iconic.
Scream Scream 2 Scream 3 Scream 4 ......Scream, again, inexplicably.  I HATE when hollywood does this bullshit. WHY?!
OK at first I got to say I was almost disappointed and let down with the whole phone endorsing because Drew Barrymore killed it the first time around and nothing can come close. The fact that you were able to get several of the main characters throughout the original movies is really what is making this a generational series. As somebody who was 13, 14 and 16 when 1-3 came out these made our childhood (mine and my friends as well as the actors who were everywhere on screen and TV).  I’m glad to see the new young actors being brought into this I’ve seen many throughout other movies and series so the new generations can fall in love with these all over while most likely their parents and grandparents love the adult cast for being the OGs. Please don’t kill off Sidney, Dewey, or Gale (it’s such a shame about Skeet Ulrich especially as he’s been on Riverdale and same with Matthew Lillard but can bring back the dead or can you???)  in high school when the first movie came out and college, career is the next ones and so on came out
waaaah. this is real??? i love this movie
Wow incredible I can't wait my favorite ghostface 💜💙
Yes I can't wait to see this. So much nostalgia
Bruh I can’t, ever since i saw scary movie i can’t take scream seriously
Why January and not October
Wait so a reboot where they get unmasked so what, make money and show villain?
The moment you realize we're running out of new ideas
Im pretty sure the guy behind the mask is number 1 aka the old man in squid game
I hope it's a lone wolf male killer like in Scream 3 instead of multiple killers. In Scream 3 Roman was super aggressive, fast and intelligent. In my opinion he was the most badass Ghost face. Plus the dude was a lone wolf. Pulled off all the killings in the third film alone without any help unlike the others.
Just like Halloween ends, a final finale
"Hello sidney, what's your favorite scary movie?"
Normal day in brixton
Looks good, but ghost face doesn’t say “do you want to play a game?” That’s jigsaw’s line. Ghost face says “do you like scary movies?”
Who still have a land line?
STOP SHOWING SO MUCH IN MOVIE TRAILERS lol
So its just become the thing is parodied? Cool...
Stu part of the cast too
01:47 is a woman, look a this expression.
I hope Doofy makes a cameo.
They've been bringing back a lot of the famous killer movies - Child's Play, Candyman, Halloween, and now Scream. I don't know if my wallet can keep up lol
Nice halloween costume
The TV show was still better
Ok ok
Courtney Cox, I love you, your so hot 🔥 on that show ! 🤣
excited for this, have tbh I dont like the new halloween movies... they've made those movies more about vigilantism... you're supposed to be scared of michael not going after him... stupid more about her on her female empowerment trip smh..
What if they did it like 1981 Halloween 2 where most of the movie takes place at the hospital?
Sidney lost her cute baby fats
As ghostface being my favorite killer, I’m excited for this movie
Is stew gonna come back 🤣
Can't wait.
Something i'm noticing about this ghostface right away is the sheer brutality and almost monster movie esq appearance the killer gives off, appearing behind someone like Jason, doing the classic Michael Myers head tilt, the way it shows off its knife like Freddy's Knife glove fingers. This Ghostface seems to actually show off attributes of the very movies that every other ghostface failed to inspire itself as. And then there's the line "Hello Sydney it's an honor" that line almost makes it seem like this ghostface has no affiliation to Syd at all, every other one has, Billy and Stu, Syds boyfriend and friend, Billys Mother, wanting to kill Syd for what she did to Billy, Roman, Syds half brother who was the main conspirator of Morieen Prescott's murder, and Jill, Syds cousin who wanted to gain Sydney's fame from Scream 1. this killer however from that one line implies it simply wanted to meet Syd and kill her as a means of being the one thing no other ghost face has been before, someone completely unrelated to Sydney at all being the one to finally put her down. I just picked up on that.
The "5" wasn't added to the name of the movie. I loved it.
OOOWEEE IM EXCITED
I'm ready to see some of the survivors die, although I'm gonna hate it. What do you foresee, guys?
I must be the only person who found the trailer funny. The text exchange reminded me of the funny movie 😂😂
The fact I can't see this in cinemas makes me sad
One of the main 3 have to fall!!! Can't wait
You poor thing
Plz hindi trailer
🤣🤣🤣she hung up
Just wondering who is directing this new film since Wes Craven passed away
The Scream and Halloween kills have a similar connection 💀
Sooo ready for Scream again! Looks really good!
Oooooo I love scream
Stu is the killer.
WAZZZZZUPPPP
Just no, linking to their past, the new style of kills, the stalking.... this is not Michael Meyers stop pretending and trying to reinvent this into a franchise that matters.
Thats the same house.......its Stew
It's like scary movie but not funny
Ahhh fuck that!!! I would have seen it if it came out this October just like Halloween Kills. But scream is coming in January which is a let down ima skip this movie.
Sydney can not get a freaking break!!
2022
2005
スクリームシリーズ大好き✨ ぜひ観たいですね
Holy shit I’ve been waiting years for this
its a fucking morron in a mask, its not like ur gonna fight fucking micheal myers. Shoot the damn dude jeez
Scream again 🤦🏻‍♂️
Stu is the killer again
IM SO EXUTED OMFGG
Meh!!!! I guess someone's rent was due...!! Doesn't look THAT thrilling .. more desperate!!!
Looks the same as every other Scream movie?
Its back
Im excited for this, Scream is one of the most consistently good horror franchises.
Actually looks good surprisingly
I have no clue they making another new scream movie?
Dam 11 years later scream is back im hyped
dylan minnette is obviously ghostface
Well I Am Not Going To Seen This Scram 2022 Movie Ever Ever Again And No I Had Enough Of Horror Movies
You guys need to stop remaking shit!  BE ORIGINAL!!!!
This would never happened in the hood!….lol
Sydney is the killer now
Did I just see Dylan? Oh I’m in! 😌✋ Can’t wait to see this! And the “hello Sydney it’s an honour.” Oh my gosh I’m so hyped😌☝️
So Matthew Lillard is in the cast ? Stus alive and the killer confirmed ?
Nice ;)
Yes Courtney and syd
Even the killer is a fan 😂
Well Paramount Pictures YouTube Team I Am Not Into Horror Movies I Am Not A Fan Of It
Let me guess they finally kill Dewey
Wazzzzzup!
Even though the first one can never ever ever be topped, this looks not bad
Yassss
Seriously just final destinationed this sh** not watching that lame a** ruination
Courtney Botox
Damn it they gon kill my wife Ghost face ain’t bullet proof I’m gon shoot him gotta get my revenge
Lame, leave the scream legacy alone… sequels suck
This looks darker and more serious, can't wait to see it. BTW "hello Sidney" never gets old.
we want stu back
I feel bad for the girl at the beginning lol
I hope they don’t reveal who the ghost face is this time, and only hint at who he is.
Man wtf is going with Hollywood. Halloween and know Scream. To all the 80s and 90s kids we are blessed ✊.
Lame. COME UP WITH NEW ORIGINAL STORIES. sick of the constant remakes
January 14th? This movie literally comes out on my 23rd birthday.
I like how the V in the M letter in Scream reference Scream 5
I bet the killer is someone from the first movie. That’ll be the twist
Clay jenson is the killer
Love how the poster is yet another SCREAM nod to Halloween
Yessir I hope they bring back a old character
Does anyone else think this looks terrible lol? Or am I the only one 🤨
I feel like they’re gonna kill off Dewey.
Damn 9 mil
Brings me back to being in high school 15yo. Im 38yo now.  I saw the original movies - scream, i know what you did last sunmer movies in the cinemas.
Something's happening in January. First trailer for Halloween Kills got 10M views currently. This trailer already has 9M views in only 3 days.
I filled up at the end of this. Nostalgia X 100000000000. I grew up with the first three Scream movies, now I'm in my 30s and cannot wait to see Gale, Dewey, and Sidney take on another Ghost Face. Didn't think we'd get another Scream movie after the fourth installment!
isnt this a tv show
I love this franchise but it's going to be a block buster  fail
This is just the old Scream with smart phones and social media
Oh hell yeah
who asked for this 90 day warranty refurbished item?
What!!! January!! U can’t release it then release it on halloween
Ew no
Cool
Isn’t this kinda what 4 was poking fun at tho
Who ever is the killer it's someone older..you can tell by the fake voice machine...also it seems more personal
Hughie is here, Ghostface is no match for Homelander wth
cool supervillain, just wait till spiderman arrives 👍👍
come January these movie theater  WILL BE PACKEDDD I definitely WILL be there
WAZZZZZZZUPPPP
Oh come on don’t fuck up Scream
ok... So nobody has a new idea???  Let's do scream again! 😅
yassssss another one chiii 😆😆😆
honestly looks no different than any of the previous 4
They already did 2, 3, and 4 are they embarrassed to call this one scream 5 ?
OH MY GOD! If this is real im am sooooooo gonna see this in theaters i watched each scream at least 4 times i love this movie!!!
I remember seeing the first scream in times square back amc in 2000
The scariest part of this is that she still owns a home phone!
Best trailer ever
This kinda looks like that when they rebooted Halloween
Cryptkeeper: it's the Same Game of Cat and Mouse once again, Kiddies, especially from the future victims of Tonight's Tale, it's a Nasty Nugget about a series of Murders from a Familiar Murderer you know him very well, it's the same old game but for the New Era, I Call it: "Scream".
The only downside to this they aren't gonna release to dvds
Can someone tell if this is a reboot or like Scream 5 that continues the story?
So this is not a sequel but a new version?
From all of the skits of scream, i lost the capacity to take it seriously, this his given me it back.
I am ready!!!!!
I've read some of the comments left by people saying they like the serious tone, and I just couldn't disagree more. Scream was special because of it's tongue in cheek approach to the slasher genre. It's clear satire and self awareness made it feel fresh and new. This trailer looked so generic, and the main characters- besides Sidney- look so old I can't imagine them lasting two seconds with a serial killer. Dewey looks like he'll die just by getting up off the sofa.  Obviously this isn't the actors fault, but I can't help but find it distracting. I'm not saying the movie is definitely gonna be bad or anything, I'm just really hoping they don't actually try to take it so seriously. That would show a total lack of understanding of what made the original innovative.
bruh i wish it was out already
Leave Sidney  alone !!!
Gale weathers's face scares me more than ghostface
Mmmmh 🤔
I swear if this is horrible like Halloween kills is I literally am giving up on reboots and remakes of horror movies. Halloween kills was atrocious. Please please for fucks sake be good.
wazzzzzzzzzuuuuupppp 😂😂
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh man out of all the scream movies this looks like the first one they're trying to actually make seem scary. Its gonna be interesting seeing sydney not being the one being targeted by ghost face. Cant wait to see how it plays out as her being the one protecting people instead of being protected
My prediction: One of the original killers IS the killer! 👻🔪😱
Stories are stupid. A different killer each time. This can go on forever 🤦‍♂️
Ok but not calling it "5cream" is such a wasted opportunity.
Doors locked, doors unlocked... Wtf! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This looks hella good
Terrible, it's the original with Amazon technology 😂
Now‼️‼️ This looks dam good I hope they execute this they way it needs to be if they do this will be wayyy better then Halloween kills🙏😁
Welp. We all know its fucking Hewie from the boys. Absolutely no question
I hope they do my idea where it ends up being one or all of the original 3 because they're just sick of all this shit.
Yes
Better be Stu
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!!
HUGHIE!
This is scream 5
The slasher genre is long gone...bringing back 'I know what you did last summer' and 'Scream' isn't gonna make it a thing again.
imagine if sidney was the killer this time ooooh a concept
This film looks fit af
I love horrors!!! Conjurings! Haunted house! Drag me to hell! Sixth sense! Hills have eyes! Ect but I was never into scream still not am I alone!?
It would be so ironic if it was Stu
Now we need Scary Movie
This seems similar to the tv series.
i wouldn't exactly call this a scream movie it doesn't have the same atmosphere or vibe as the originals.
Scream ain’t scary no more 😢
Dark, deadly, and CRAZY! I can't wait for it!!
Lemme guess they shoot him to death again?
Her Mouth Bigger than SCREAM KillerXD
Yo I've been noticing a lot of classic horror icons being revived lately and I'm just here thinking are Slasher films really making a comeback to horror? If so then fuck yeah I'm all for it!!
I'm more excited for the parody.
I know Scream from a long time ago, but I played Dead By Daylight and it makes me love Scream more than before.
I can’t stop thinking of John Mulaney when I see Ghostface.
He is from the boys on amazon prime hughie campbell!
I just know this new scream movie is gonna be awesome
So hyped for this movie 😮‍💨
I’m down for this horror is supposed to vicious and serious so ready ❤️❤️
All of the slasher franchises are making a return Scream being my favorite seeing this makes me very happy. I need to see my boy Jason back though 😔
I already got my ghostface mask it could be me😈
Damn it's tough to be a teen in Woodsboro!
I'M SO GLAD SIDNEY PRESCOTT IS BACK
who tf still has telephones???
SYDNEY, GALE, AND DEWEY ARE BACK!? - Fuck yes!!! This is gonna be good. Can’t wait to watch
About time!! 😎
I’m the biggest Scream fan of all time (in my humble opinion). However, I am aware of a rejected concept that was originally going to be the 3rd movie. There was supposed to be a twist (which I won’t spoil) and I think it’s what they are doing for this movie. I pray to God I’m wrong. My favorite part of these movies is wondering who the killer is.
Haters: not ANOTHER Scream movie...  Oh look....Spiderman is getting its 9th reboot!
Wait, is this “Scream” a remake? A reinvision? A long awaited follow up?? The original was the first R rated film I saw in the theater.
Same exact thing as Halloween lmao
It’s good to see the BIG 3 again
Hell yes.
This looks better than the lame ass Home Sweet Home Alone shitty reboot
Please stop..
YES!!! As a Scream fan this is gonna be amazing..... 😝😝
This is basically like Halloween with Michael Myers
ON MY BIRTHDAY!?
What’s next I  know what you did last 20 years
This is why we use spine chill
What I love about the Scream movies is that they keep the main characters. Thank you for not replacing them!
Ghost face really gives Sydney annual leaves from him for a while then comes back like nothing happened 😭
They are back at Stu's house!! Im getting a beer, you want one? Sure. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!!
It's a scream baby!!
WTF is this?????? The original Movie was released in 1996 - 25 Years ago The original Halloween Movie was released in 1978 and then there was a remake in 2018 But at least they acknowledged the Original..........
So glad the original 3 is in this. If they weren't I probably wouldn't be interested at all. Especially with Wes Craven passing #RIP
Sydney Prescott. Its an honour. Damn right it is
Can't wait for this! Scream was my childhood! I used to watch it every summer vacation with a different sets of friends. Based on the trailer, here's what I think. Dewey will die based on Gale's reaction in a quick scene where she seemed very devastated about the death of someone. Also, Officer Hicks, who we all know, is in love with Dewey, has the same scene where she seemed so mad about something. Jenna Ortega's character will either die or will be the first-ever character to survive the first attack during the opening scene cause I think she's the one in a wheelchair at the hospital. But I think they just want to play with our minds with this trailer. I still hope Selena Gomez, as rumored, is in this movie and will be the first kill. I hope they won't touch the big three. Sidney, Dewey and Gale or else I'll get really mad and disappointed. Especially Sidney! Don't you dare touch our Sidney!
I struggle to understand why a nation of gun owners is afraid of a guy with a knife. And therefore, who needs this plot?
Omg don't know if I can sit. Though other one cause hope they don't kill off sin
That was a very underwhelming trailer
Let’s go! My favorite movie is the original Scream, can’t wait to see how this one compares
I’ll tell you something I really liked the comedy of the other screams but this looks crisp👌
So same as the first one just updated electronics lol
i think its gonna be some sort of relative of Stu like a brother or something
Looks good.
Wazzzzzaaaaaaaaapppppp
He never dies swear to god 😂
Notice how they didn’t show dylan or stu in the trailer.. those are the 2 killers
OH MY GOOD LORD
Why not release it during Halloween season?
I don’t know about this one chief ..
Should've called it Screams.
Isn’t scream supposed to be funny!????
I’m not overwhelmed , It just looks good not great but l I’ll see it regardless
This looks so good
This might be a stretch, but does anyone think the killer could be Jill? I mean, maybe she ended up surviving the gunshot and was re-hospitalized instead of dying. I think that and Stu being the killer would add a nice little plot twist to the film, considering you always have to think outside the box when it comes to Scream films
WHOS READY TO SEE DEWEY GET STABBED AGAIN!!!!
Lol imagine it’s Randy
People: complaining its a january movie so its autimatically going to suck  Yeah not judging this movie by a stupid month and january is my birthday so i can see it around that time
MY HOPES FOR A HORROR MOVIE WINNING AN OSCAR ARE REAL
Love these type of slasher movies and the first scenes gives a look like fear street part 1 😍
"THERE ARE RULES!!!"   not sure if they are following them....
Yessss! This trailer looks amazing! Darker and more serious, plus original characters, I'm definitely here for it. And I saw the original in theaters and grew to an adult with the franchise so do my movie right y'all 🙂❤️
que bueno que vuelvan las pelis Slasher, son las mejores. 🔪🔪
Yawn
The killer is officer Doofy
The girl, Tara, has two phones and not once call 9-1-1 on either one?
this is so stupid !!!!
WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP
make... something original... for the love of God.
Sidney is like a side character in her own movie it feels like lol
I want to see this Movie so Bad I'm hoping it's good tho .
Ahh yes.... *The only horror movie I watch when my parents aren't home*
STU! I HOPE STU IS IN IT!
Sydney use the smartphone with the same ringtone as the past. She is pain addiction. She is the killer !!
The killer is Stu listen to how he quotes jigsaw and Not only that they appear at his house at the end of the trailer Plus Stu was never confirmed dead
Lmao some dude in Halloween costume
The first thing I would do
Very good trailer.
The classic “this isn’t *insert friends name*” Love it. Welcome back, ghost face.
My type of movies oh yeahhhh
OH MY FUCKING GOD YES
If ride it till the wheels fall off was a movie 🥴
THIS IS AWESOME!! IM SO HYPED
What are the movie rules this time around? Do the legacy characters die like in Star Wars or do they make it to the sequel like Jamie Lee Curtis?
Now this looks good😍 I can’t wait to see this
Nostálgico !!!
"You poor thing" Jokes aside,this looks awesome!
Why Tara why did you open that god dam door -_-
Amazing movie
I Thought Scream 4 was the ending of the series
I am in love with this film series. It’s so rare to have a “final girl” reprise her role in a horror series five times, and that doesn’t even include Gale and Dewey. Three awesome characters surviving through four (maybe five) consecutive horror films is so iconic, and you can tell there’s such a great chemistry between them. I don’t know if all three of them will make it out of this new movie alive, but if not, they gave it a good fight. I can’t wait to see what happens.
I remember  "oh you wanna play psycho killer?  Can i be the helpless victim?  Okay, pls dont kill mr. Ghostface i wanna be in the sequel"  Hahah
Don't let him.get Dewey ♡
The old one was horror and comedy and now the remake is already scary of course, which is that makes me *Scream*
The killer is Stu he came back to finish the job. Unfortunately he never died from the original.
Sydney and laurie strode had enough 😂
I love how she already has a phone in her hand but drops it to go to another phone 😂😂😂
This'll be the longest 3 months of my life
I hope this ain't all the screen time the slasher is gonna get. This film's got some serious potential.
So as I was driving home from the theater after seeing Halloween Kills (which I loved) it hit me. What if Scream 5 isn't really Scream 5 it Scream 2 like what Halloween 2018 was for Halloween 78 but we don't know it's "Scream 2" until closer to premier date or that is something we find out during the movie. That is also a way to bring Randy back and possibly Stu. It's just 25 years after the 1st one. I liked that idea for Halloween but I don't want that for Scream so hopefully I am just over thinking and this will be the 5th installment
Showing too much.
How many Scream movies are they going to make?
Another one ?
Love the fact everyone depicts how a movie will be based on a 2 min trailer 🤣 and people wonder why they're disappointed when a movie isn't what they thought it would be after watching a 2 minute trailer.
Omg I was just thinking I wonder where is Neve Campbell nowadays.
But did you have to make Jenna Ortega die first tho
I'm here for it
It looks a bit shit but I'm excited.
Here they come to ruin another franchise..
What even is So good about the scream franchise, i wouldn't even consider this a slasher, its more of a Murder Mystery Movie.
"Whats your favorite scary movie ?"
Bruh just call this movie  scream 5
This is hilarious
Can't wait💀
Why revive this franchise lol stupid paramount what are you Disney lol
YASSS!!! I’m so excited!! OMG!! My nerdy self even made a fan art video of Ghostface right before they released the trailer the other day lol 😅
This movie feels like its going to be actual dogshit. It looks like it was made in a few weeks with minimal thought put into it. I dont even know why yall are hyping up this lame generic horror movie smh
Everyone says it looks darker which is good cause it fits to nowadays
It’s a Scream baby
Calling it now, Taras sister Sam and Wes (Clay) are the killers … it’s so obvious
Unoriginal for them to make anyone in the friend group the killer again because they did it in Scream 1 and 4 heavy and I think we are going back to it being 1 killer like the 3rd movie. Eliminate suspects outta the friend group which the trailer shows it doesn't really care about anyway but is still there to keep us guessing and put emphasis on Stu's house, the line of "this one feels different" and "the killer is going after the relatives". Also the line of "its an honor" shows the killer has known her story but has never met her. Dont think Stu if he did in fact return would say that. I think Stu has a deeply close relative who grew up obsessive over what he did, bought the house and everything and wants to continue what Stu and Billy didn't finish.
Not Generation TikTok thinking this is an original movie 😭 I’m old 😂
People are so stupid asking why she ran outside … just because you saw a .3 second of a clip of her running outside doesn’t mean she ran out after the “call”..  I swear I’ve never met so many stupid people in my life
“Would You Like To Play A Game?” JigSaw “Say No More”
New SCREAM movie, new CHUCKY tv show, new HALLOWEEN movie, WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE
With Halloween and scream both being rebooted are we gonna get a whole universe with all these psycho's together. Or a halloween and scream crossover could be called HALLOWEEN SCREAMS 🤣
Oh man I’m so excited for this
l'm still waiting for it since 2012
Omg he is such an Aquarius
SCREAM is a legendary franchise! Even the Netflix series was dope.
MY FAVORITE HORROR MOVIE IS BACCCCKKKK!!! #HelloSidney
Liv Mckenzie!!! As the Killer!!!!
This should be titled Scream Let there be carnage.. seems just about right.
the never ending story of Sydney.. loved it.. Scream has a special place in our hearts!! I'm guessing Jack Quiad is the killer already! 😹
😴
WAZZZUP
It’s time to die Ghost👻Face
1:01 also don't forget to bring decisive strike and unbreakable
2:06  Gave me SERIOUS chills
Best comedy franchise ever! I'm ready!!
Waiting for scary movie 6 now next year..spoof
I don't know why each time I see that guy with that white scary mask, all I could think of is The first Scary Movie 😂😭
It has been too long. I'm so ready for this.
Why why the fuck is it called just scream call it scream 5 is it that fucking hard
I loved the unlocking and locking part kinda funny
My 💰 is on this movie will be WOKE trash..
I remember being TERRIFIED of Ghostface as a kid. Here I am, 20 years later, EXCITED for a new installment!
So there basically doing the recent Halloween but with ghost face? I'm in😁
Sydney remind me of the main comingnback for nightmare 3 and died if Sydney don't die her ass Ghostface period
Definitely
Ok time to rewatch Scary Movie 😆
Nice
that "hello, sidney. it's... an honor." gives me CHILLS every time. i am so stoked for this movie, i wish it was january already! i've been stuck on squid game, so it's really exciting having something new to look forward to.
following the scream horror rules, the killer should be someone from the first movie..
So now in this franchise there are three different products just called ‘Scream’, who’s idea was this
I will never understand why these movies were considered scary. Just some dude in a costume. Mortal.
Loved the trailer but really.. SCREAM…. thats it…… It exists already couldn’t have called it something different.. “your last scream”, “ghostface” , “scream again”. just Scream!? Lazy name calling. Now i have to say who wants to watch scream 96 or scream 2022 .Thats exhausting .
I would excuse this movie for just being called "Scream" if it was a shot-for-shot remake of the 1995 original, with the same cast as the original, even though Neve Campbell, Drew Barrymore, Skeet Ulrich, Matt Lillard, and Rose McGowan (and assorted 40+year-old extras) would all be playing high school students.
Scream: would you like to play a game? Saw: hey thats my line
Ok love the trailer but be real whoever directed this who has a landline phone now days
"Want to play a game?" GTFO This bitch aint jigsaw! It's “What’s your favorite scary movie?”
HEY THIS GUY IS NEXT UP https://youtube.com/channel/UCTYPPBUa0NXSadaseVa-hcg
Neve Campbell got old.
Who the hell has a landline?
Meh.  This movie would have been over in 34 seconds, when the phone said, “doors unlocked.”  My response would have been, “Shotgun unlocked.”
Жду.
IM READY BADASS GHOSTFACE IS BACK 👹👹👹🎃🎃🎃😎😎😎👍👍👍
Where’s Kirby with the no death clause?
READY!!! 💀💀💀🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾 and Dewy, Gail and Sydney are all back! Yes! I love all of the SCREAM movies!!
Damn imagine this came out this month 😬😳
Wassup!!!
I can't wait to see the movie. It looks so intense
IM REAY MORE SCREM MORE WOODSBORO BLOODBATH THINK MAKE MASTERPIECE
The original is probably the best slasher of all time.
have a gun, boom problem solved, movie ends
Let’s go, so ready for this! ✊🤘🔥
So looking forward to this, wish it would’ve came out right around Halloween, bet it would/will do better then the new Halloween movie. I’m going to see it this weekend, hoping it’s a good one. But I’ve been waiting so long for a new ghost face! My favorite scary movie!
This ghostface is the reason why the boogeyman has second thoughts about haunting people
No wonder why the scream series ended.
I can't wait!!! I love the movies!!
This should have come out during October 👀
< 20% on Rotten...looks horrible
Why isnt it called Scream 5???
So dewy dies huh
It's gonna be a screamin scream
Scream would be better if it came out in Halloween just saying
Scream is back!! I've been waiting for this movie to Finally Happened.
It should be called 5cream obviously.
Finally I only miss that Dimension Films no longer has involvement with these, them as well as the mind behind the mayhem, Wes Craven RIP
I'm so excited 😍
RIP Dewey
What if it’s Gail and Dewey??? 😳😬😳😬 just a thought Edit: Gale***
I am gonna be sleeping outside the cinema in my ghostface t-shirt to be da 1st in cannot wait!!!! Neve is my heroine!!!! This looks freaky as oh an btw rest in peace Wes ud b proud of this CANT WAIT YEEHAAAA
Wasssaaaaappp!!!
It's got those darker elements like the TV show had! Which that 3rd season was 🔥! Anybody think it could be Stu? Horror makin' a comeback. Chucky, Halloween and Scream!
That ankle crush... Hey Neve :) Huey from The Boys?!   SCCCCRRREEEAAAMMMMMM!!!
Wow!  More regurgitated crap
Watching this movie will be an honour. So dam excited this is epic.
I can barley recognize Sidney
Horror movies today are my brand of comedy
YES YES YES YES YES I’M EXTREMELY READY FOR THIS
Lets play a game really?#sawcatchphrase
Y’all saw Clay Jensen?? Imagine if he’s the killer?👀
I was never scared by killers and slashers until i saw scream, it’s creepily realistic
"Hello Sydney"
This looks like shit.
Is this really what we want guys? Sorry to be burst you guys bubble but this is just another reboot. Reboots a majority of the time are trash and never live up to the original. This won't be any different
what if when sydney says "I won't sleep until he's in the ground" what if she's talking about stu???🤨
Paramount Shmaramount https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNg3Vnfu4Pk&t=1882s
Ooooooooohh fuuuuuuckkkkk yeahhhhhhhh…. Gonna be fuckin gooooood
First Halloween now scream who is next Friday?
Why wouldn't they release the movie for Halloween??
IMAGINE ITS STU
Just PLEASE, whoever the killer is, please let them have a decent motive. The last Scream was so fricking dumb. The motive was basically "you got more attention than me" 🙄
Omg yes

Ghost face sucks, I’m the coolest.
Who came here for Warzone?
Where is officer doofy!?!?
One of the greatest franchises.. Considering the fact that most of original scream actors are here, it makes it extremely  nostalgic and eagerly awaited!  Hope the movie makes Wes Craven proud! 👍
CANT WAIT!!! ITS SPOOKYYY😃
Y'all remember that one movie when he said "wazzupp! " 😂
This looks dooope. I always thought ghost face was cheesy but respected and enjoyed the films. That being said, I'm so fkn hyped.
We are in a Cultural stagnation
So excited!
This time it's the finale... maybe.. prolly.?     Oh God, we're getting a 6th in a retirement home😭
Prediction : The killer is a female this time around. Remember this comment.
Would have been nice if they used Selena Gomez in the opening scene.
so this is where ellie went🕺🏻
When living in a apartment is better than a house
I can't wait!
This scream looks dark doesn’t look like there going to add any comedy in it like scream 3. This one looks great
Can’t wait to see it
Why in January though
If the house is wired to be a smart home and she has a cell phone then why is there a landline from the early 2000s?
" would you like to play a game ? "  " No "  * Credit role *
Dewey's dead. Mark my words.
I thought Shaggy was scream
Just saw this before Halloween kills. Must say im excited, looks like a proper balance between modern tech(given ghostface likes phones) and modern horror savagery. Nice uptick for the protagonist.
HYPEEEEEEEEEEEEE
This shit looks so good, they don't miss a beat with scream!  But I do miss #WesCraven in peace ✌️ to the scare king 👑
Omg!!!! It's Ghostface again!!!!
Oh yes...the hype...all the fucking horror movies coming out so soon, i'm fucking hyped.
The heads are rolling song is amazing
I didn’t mean to click skip. I got scared at the door and my nose accidentally hit skip
Yeah.... This franchise needs to end🙄
How the fuck is Dewey alive
🔥🔪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Honestly I'm thrilled the OGs are back in this.
dang who has house phones anymore?  but forreal, this looks amazing. cant wait to see it!
My favorite movie of all time is Scream (no, I'm not kidding). So this may have me intrigued.
Welcome back Sidney Prescott ! Omg
This is the decade of reboots.
YESSSS YAYYYYY YAYYYYYYYYYY YESSSSSSS😩😩😩😩IMM LOVING YALL RIGHT NOWWW NEW CHUCKY NEW MICHAL NEW GHOSTFACE I LOVE YOU GUYSSSSSSS
Ffs, really? Hollywood just has no new and original ideas anymore. Same old, same old regurgitated sh*t.
Is this real?
whew chile, i don’t think i’ve ever wanted to see a horror more than this one
yes i love all the movies but i haven’t watched the 4th one
So awesome how many times this trailer has been viewed!  Sidney will never ever ever be the killer.  No way, no how.  This would be a downright disrespectful decision and honestly I don’t think Neve would do it, if that’s the route they wanted to take.  She’s the ultimate badass final girl and that’ll be her legacy through these films.    Interesting to see only Gale and Sidney present during what’s clearly the finale of the film at Stu’s old house.  I have a feeling Dewey isn’t going to make it out alive in this 5th outing.  Love this trailer… very dark and the camera loves Melissa Barrera, she’s a good choice for a new leading heroine.
About time!
Lol terrible. Who the fuck has a land line
Welp. Its official. Never getting smart locks
The gangs back together again!
I dont think slasher films work anymore unless you’re out in the wilderness
Spoiler: It’s always more then one killer in scream
I wonder who the killer is this time
It better be good it’s part 5
oh January material.
FINALLY!!!  They cut the comedy and went with suspense and horror!
Dewy is gonna die why else would the sheriff and gale be upset 🤷‍♂️
SIDNEY AND NOT SYDNEY
Feels different this compared to the others. Got a good feeling! Actually a horror 👏🏼 roll on January 14th.
I hope they pull the ultimate swerve and make Sydney the killer (possibly working along with Stu). It sounds nonsensical, but actually would make a whole lot of sense. Being stalked relentlessly for 25 years could turn anyone into a psychopath. She can finally quit running from the monster by becoming one herself. Plus being the villian for a new trilogy would be a great way to pass the torch to a new cast for future installments.
Yaaaaas!
Finally I'll watch this film , I look forward
All i can hear the scream dude say Hiiiiii Drewwww - the comedy element for me outdoes everything lol
I have a feeling this Ghostface will be the most sinister one yet. Seeing him stomp on a leg in this, that is ruthless. He's going to be terrifying in this. Wes Craven would be proud.
Love how this was going to be an all new movie that may or may not have something to do with the lasts ones. Wasn’t going to have any of the cast of the original or anything. But like everything else it’s hard to be original
#HYPE
Maybe Matthew Lillard’s character is the killer?! 👻
Yess This is what I've been waiting for years. I'm glad they made ghost face serious and gruesome.
Now I can't stop thinking of ghost face from scary movie
I am not impressed. This is basically a rip-off of ‘Halloween’ (2018). As a major SCREAM super fan girl, this is a major yawn 🥱
I’ve already been through this “ALOT” hurd you Sydney😂😂
Universal coming out with some bangers!! 🔥 🔥
I wish we would get a new Jason vorhees movie or freddy Krueger movie
And to think it's the same guy who played Mojo Jojo from the Powerpuff Girls making the phone calls. Welcome back, Sidney! Now to record yet ANOTHER vhs to my complete Scream collection!
"Hello Sidney, it's an honour!" Goosebumps every time I hear that line. CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS!!!!
Ok now this is the 5th movie, If Dewy don't know how to fight by now he might be dead in this one. Lol.

I still remember when the first movie gave me nightmares. Legendary horror series, pumped
Why dont they ever call the cops ?
Its a bit ridiculous how many times Sidney and pals keep getting involved but ill give it a watch.
Omg so scary. Glad they got rid of alot of the comedy bs. Reminds me alot of part 1 and it wouldnt surprise me if Stu is the killer. Ghostface moves quick, hes tall and reminds me alot of the original.
I like this trailer, just hope this is the final chapter because these original cast members are getting old and worn  out.
Ghostface isn't playing around this time. I really like the dark tone it feels like 1996 when I was 9 years old all over again. My Fiance and I just saw the 25th anniversary of Scream in Theaters and were hyped for this.
Am I wrong, or did they leak the killer unintentionally?
Just leave our Sidney alone why don’t ye  Fucking he’ll
This should be a movie series like Halloween
Oh my god !!!!!!!! Scream and Halloween Kill ! It's back
no way omg !!!!!!!! i can’t believe there coming with a new one i’m so glad they kept the same cast 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
WOW What A Retread Played Out Old Boring Story Hard Pass--- 🙄
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
Some people are staying Stu is alive 😬
Scream will always be a funny ass movie to me. if just feels like another scary movie💀🤣
I really expected there to be some humor but the trailer is surprisingly dark from start to finish. I love it regardless.
Gave it away in the trailer...When Ghostface tries to STAB everyone else,he tries to SLASH that guy with his arms up to make him look like a victim and he is in on it with Ghostface...Solved :D
Literally dying to see this movie yes I said it
The killer is going to be Sidney’s father’s brother’s nephew’s cousin’s former roommate. You heard it here first.
horrible desperate cash grab!
I make funny content have to make u laugh or I will have to go back to Africa!
I make funny content have to make u laugh or I will have to go back to Africa!
I'm assuming Ghostface was the one who kept unlocking the doors in that first kill scene. I guess he's tech-savvy now, lol. Still, can't wait for this movie.
Wait this was posted by paramount pictures this could be on Paramount plus
*spoilers* So it seems the killer isn't after Sidney in this one, rather the killer is trying to get revenge for Sidney by going after the relatives of previous killers, and she feels she has to stop it. I love that idea!
ah yes the first thing i do is i open the front door
Boring ...!
The killer is going to be on of the OGs i bet its gale
There are certain rules...
Once I saw Jenna I was screaming
I think this ghostface voice is the best ghostface voice. He seems much more serious too!
That's Stu's House towards the end. 👀👀👀
I'm so ready for this movie! IT'S GONNA BE SO GOOD!!
I feel they will put a - The killer is one of the original cast members - type of thing :(
What a shit series
Who tf has a landline still........
Kinda sad that a movie that was taking advantage of overused horror tropes to make a fun interesting slasher flick spawned a franchise of films reliant on overused horror tropes, this looks like the culmination of that while ripping off the 2018 Halloween where "this time the victims fight back", at least call it something else like "Screams" or "Screaming" or something
This movie is so inaccurate... Homelines in 2021... 😂
I wish Billy Loomis was the killer in this movie
I know it's just a movie but my god people, arm yourselves with a gun 😆
Yaaas biiiitch!! Im so here for it!!
HEY! "Would you like to play a game?" is Billy's thing!
Whelp, time to rewatch all the Scream films so that I'm up to speed.
Imagine it being Sydney’s mom. That would be absolutely wild in every way, shape and form
Courtney Cox looks like Caitlyn Jenner.
now all we need is jason and a freddy movie
Bruh! 'Hello, Sidney. It's an honor' utter fucking chills!! Let's go!!
So that last movie was styled as Scre4m. But they couldn't style this one as 5cream? They really just had to give it the same title as the first one like the new Halloween? What happened to creativity?
I thought this was an statefarm ad
Fucking nostalgia
NOOOO THEY KILLED OFF JENNA ORTEGAS CHARACTER IN THE TRAILER!! DAMN IT I WANTED A BIGGER ROLE FOR HER.
Dont know but the entire time I wondered what would happen if he accidentally entered the house of John Wick XD. Guess we know how that ends.
WOWWWW
Feel like they dropped the ball on the release date, should have been in October. More people would come see it around Halloween.
This shit looks lame, they should have made it a dark comedy.
They missed the opportunity to name the movie 5CREAM.
Ngl Dewey unloading his gun while coming face to face with ghost face is pretty badass ngl
But the main question is what part is STAB at now?
And the US wonders why they have ever increasing murder rates .. .
You know.. it might not happen. But if it does, I wanna see this being a fresh start with someone taking Courtney Cox's place as the "Final Person" as her character dies after stopping this new terrorizing ghostface.
This looks terrible
Um. You've seen 1 you've seen em all.
Such a flop I can already tell
Yes Sidney! 💗💗💗💗 of course she has a gun 🔫
This is offensive.
The opening scene in the first Scream film is why I fell in love with filmmaking as a teenager and it's why I went to film school. I'm very interested to see what the franchise looks like in someone else's hands, even though Wes Craven is irreplaceable.
Halloween: We brought the old gang back together! Scream: Hold my smartphone.
2.02 Really hope that’s not a spoiler! 👀😱
It’s 2021 who the hell still has a landline
I hope Stu come back I miss him
Why  is  the title  called  Scream,  instead  of  Scream  5 am  confused.
WASSAAHHHHH
Bout to watch this now lmao when it comes out
I’m way to fucking excited about this movie to come out !!
Hopefully it’s not woke like Candyman
Hahahahahahahahahaha
Yesssss:)
Lets go Brandon!
Me my parents never allow scary movies. Preview life.
WASSUP????? LOL.
I'm so exciteddd
Officer Dewey looking kind of a cool as a grizzled badass… empty/reloading that revolver of his…. This movie looks interesting 👍
They give up WAY too much in these trailers. Leave a little something for goddsakes.
Ghostface : "Do you like scary movie? " Sidney Prescott : "Yes." Ghostface : "What's your favorite                         scary movie? " Sidney Prescott : "Squid Game." Ghostface : "Seriously? "
When she said, "I've been through this. ALOT...."
NETFLIX ?
Can’t wait!! One of my favorite franchises!!
Holy shit
What about officer Judy Hicks going on a rampage? Cut to Gale screaming scen?  Pls don't kill off Sidney tho
What if it’s stu? Just saying that would be a cool idea because he would know what mistakes not to make
When I see comebacks like this I can't help to think I was born in the perfect time ever
Cool!
eh
Overall looks good, hopefully they don't kill off the original characters they were so close to death the last movie.
Let’s open the door
Why every story and movie is being remade these days
Wow so innovative from the old scream
I liked scary movie more they took a terrible horror character and made him entertaining
Wow, this actually looks scarier, nastier, and more serious than previous parts. Ghostface breaking bones and burning people alive, gosh.
Zzzzzzz bore off with another remake. Be creative not lazy
"I want to see what your insides look like"  "Then turn page 54" "Oh hey nice"
My only complaint, we didn’t hear the iconic line:  “What’s your favorite scary movie?”
STUS HOUSE
Can’t wait for the scary movie reboot !
Who do we think the killer is?!?! 🔪🚨🚒
this already looks scarier than scream 4
Does commenting "this looks darker than the previous Scream movies" give a free ticket or why do all the verified accounts post that?
Ok, I am in
Imagine still living in Woodsboro after the first 4 massacres
All I know is that they better not kill off Sidney, Dewey, or Gale for no damn shock value!
This looks so very very bad
i see this series going the way of jason and halloween movies, so many nobody gives a shit
I don't know why, but I was waiting for him to go "WAAAAAAAAAAAAZZUUUUUUUUUUUPP"
Oh My Damn. This is gonna be good.
WHAZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP 🤙🏻
As soon as I saw Jenna Ortega I got texited
Seems like it's taking itself way too seriously. Kind of defeats the purpose of the original movies.
Thank god they didn’t call it Scream 5 or something like that.
JENNA ORTEGA DIES BECAUSE I AM WATCHING THIS MOVIE FOR HET
While I like what I see, I feel I see too much here.
Does anybody love old scary movies?
Knife vs gun. Knife always wins???
she could have just dead harded smh
Looks good more serious tone
The loud noise the the scariest part
A new freaking Scream! Heck yeah! Excited!
Is that Emily Willis?!😂
India realese please
Is it not Scream 5 why is it being called Scream like the original are we gonna get a new trilogy
So cool that this made #1 on trending yesterday! This one had a much more dark and sinister vibe to it! So excited for 5cream!
https://youtu.be/bQBrhFYsztI
Lol I  keep remembering  scary  Movie!!! Lmao
Big cringe right here.  Why do they have to ruin all the classics??
Looks good
This movie is going to be so good
WAAZZZZAAAAAAAPP
Bruh its just a dude with a knife
Hell YES
😞
Oh look, another remake *yawn*
Tudo pra minha carreira esse filme 🥰😍
Melissa Barrera 😍
Same shit. Different day.
should have used a stronger password tara
I know the dude with the car is not supposed to be a teen is he ? Lol
This looks terrible
Waiting for this
Remake of the Reboot's sequel 😃?
ok we all know the killers name is Ghostface...but has anyone in the movieverse ever actually called him that? it's like Jaws, we all say it's name is Jaws but no ones ever called the shark that before in the movies?
Wow, they're already making a movie based on that Call of Duty character....
Damn Courtney Cox really forced it with the plastic surgery :(
1996: Scream 2021: Scream louder! 😱
now if they would do a continued "Death Becomes Her" life would be sweet
WOOOOOOOOOW! I have a feeling that this installment will be darker and more serial compared to its predecessors, don't you think? And also when did the franchise move to Paramount Pictures if it is owned by Miramax Films?
I love saying “what’s your favorite scary movie?” to people lol  Also what if sidneys the killer this time?
man we all aged
It looks ok, honestly probs wont go see it in theaters
The woman who plays Sydney has always been so pretty. She’s aging so well 😍
omg dylan minnette omg we won
why are all the new teens so bland and generic looking ? the original Scream teen cast all looked unique and different and stood out compared to this bland cast.
I hope they have a sequel planned. Rumor has it there *might* be a cliffhanger of sorts
this looks so bad :'(
We're rebooting this now? .. Really?
Im sure scream 2022 gonnA be better than HK ..Im shock, Halloween kills is a horrible and terrible movie  Now im waiting for scream and im sure its gonna be better than that shit. 👻🔪♥️🖤
Sydney is ghostface there saved you the wait and 2 extra hours
looks... promising :D way better than previous part
🎶Guess whose back, back again🎶
It feels like it’s taking itself too seriously, the whole slightly light hearted nature and slight parody of horror tropes was intentional, why make it serious suddenly, it will probably end up a laughing stock.
Kyle Ganner. For sure its horror
Look like a great movie
It looks good
Waiting..
Scream was my first Thriller movie.  I just want to say.....nostalgic!!!!
It's back 🍿
OMG I love Jenna Ortega
Ok now next BRING BACK THE MOVIE SAW!!!
Is the scary part that the original cast got so old?
It’ll probs be one of the cast in the trailer if not then it will be one hell of a twist.
If Matthew or Skeet is the killer that be one hella twist
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
NEVE CAMPBELL ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Did I just see Dylan Minnette? He's the killer, I'm calling it!
New movie, same shiz. There was something about the old movies and the basic shots that made it seem more real… these special effect shots just kind of take me out of the movie?
->https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSkV2jxoRVVlyohxphQK-S9R
SCREAM is back babyyyyy HYPED
The 1997 movie made me so weak that I wasn't able to go out alone as a kid I was so scared damn can't believe it's returning again with new twist and sidney is still the same  🤗 🤗 🤗
He is not like the other serial killers like Jason, Michel, and Candyman because he can die like a human.
Glad Megan Fox isn’t here to mess this up with her cringy funny scary lines like she did in “Jennifer’s Body”
I just hope they make Wes Craven Proud
Would you like to play a game? Hello, who is this? Joe Joe who? Joe Biden   Let's go Brandon
Do you think there are two ghost faces?
Can we all just stop speculating on who the next Ghostface is and just watch the damn movie!  If you really want to know just watch the trailer…it’s all there!
These are all going to suck soooooo bad, especially Halloween with that dumbass Jane curtis
Yo is that Clay Jensen?
Back to the original house!? I'm so ready!!!
Haloween is back, Scream is back, Friday the 13th is back, Chucky is back, Jigsaw is back....What year is it? And when is Freddy Krueger joining the party?
imagine if scream came out at the same time as the new halloween movie... wulda been a crazy box office battle but hMMM january  release date...
From the directors of Ready or Not this looks AWESOME
If Matthew Lillard plays his role as the Ghostface reveal, I would loose my mind
Will this be 18 and over?
“I won’t sleep til he’s in the ground”  Scream 5: Halloween Kills
Hoping for a good slasher movie but preparing for yet ANOTHER completly fucked up and disastrous reboot/remake.
This looks METAL ASF I LOVE IT
HECK YES!!!!
This looks very very good!!! Love to see the cast back too
How come in every scream movie through out the movie the killer is all 😕, Then once they admit who they are, they’re all 😜😜🤪🤪😝😝
Awesome trailer now let's try and get a proper reboot of a nightmare on elm street.
Dwayne Johnson is ghostface 👻
Whatssssuppppp
Courtney Cox look so smooth and clean, by the way is she and Dewey still married??
Anyone notice the 5 is still in the title? The "V" shape in the letter M in SCREAM is roman numeral number 5
Don't love so much this new teenagers but the film look a worth viewing. So happy to see the main cast 💙😭
Good to see 'Neve Campbell' as Sidney Prescott again❤ Courtney too as 'Gale Weathers'❤❤  Makes me want to watch Scream again from the start.
We are SO READY for new Scream!
Y’all are just nostalgic. This looks corny af 😂😂
YOOOOO I'M HYPE
Feels different without wes  looks like a Jason blum reject film
Just in time for Halloween!
I remember watching the first one and loving it. Definitely gonna watch. Hope it's not full of woke bs.
IM DOWN! 👏🏼
Goosebumps!!!!  Ghostface is my favourite serial killer. Even Wes Craven would be astonished how good this looks
wow ı was 11 when ı went to the cinema of scream 4 🤙🏻
ITS BEEN TEN YEARS!!! AND THIS ONE COMES OUT ON MY BIRTHDAY!
yh alright
I. Love. This.
Claim your 'here before an day' ticket right here!
PLEASE BE GOOD
The return of the original voice at the end is just fantastic!
HELLO SIDNEY
Ghostface has returned!!!
Let’s gooooo
Is this Ghostface gonna be someone from Sidney's past that we'll never heard of and they'll try to come off as they were there since the beginning?
It's so cringe not until I saw the original scream main casts!
Oh come on! Where is the original soundtrack?? The new film won't have this vibe without it.
"Something about this one feels different". Naaahhhhh, not really! It looks just like the same unimaginat­ive, repetitive, boring, assembly line production, we've been exposed so many times before.
Lol. Its coming out in January. We all know what happens with horror movies that come out in the beginning of the year.
One of my favorite movie series, slasher movie
_This is not a horror film, its a comedy lol_
HELL YES A NEW SCREAM MOVIE COMING OUT!!!!!!! LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'M FUCKING READY FOR THIS!!!!!! *HAPPY DANCE*
I bet jenna ortega’s character is the killer HAHAHA
It’s them returning to Stu’s house that’s got me so damn excited to see the outcome
holy fckin' shit
The “Hello Sydney…. It’s an honor”  Gives me CHILLS  can’t wait for this movie!!!
Yes! A legit sequel! OW!!!
来年が楽しみですね！
The fourth part should have been like this.
“ you poor thing “
I cant wait for the remake of Spiral and Candyman... oh and REALLY need a remake of The Joker and Hubie Halloween, they need a facelift.. I mean we could do some movies from the 60s 70s.. but we should do more from the 2000s... cos its so hard to remember
These movies just keep delivering 2022 we outside now!!
Waaassssuuuuuppppp!!
scary movies
Okay this looks good, I def wanna see this. I just saw Disney is doing a home alone reboot and it looks garbage.
“Hello Sidney, it’s an honor” gave me straight up chills
oke. lets restart again. This is Scream 1 next will be Scream 2, 3 and 4
Personal theory: Kirby from scream 4, we saw her get slashed out on the patio after finding out Emma Roberts was the killer, but we never saw her get killed, so I believe that Kirby will come back and be the killer cause she researched the killer's for Sidney in scream 4, and was probably hiding the information about the blood relations...
INCREDIBLE 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Me before watching the trailer: They're doing another one?  Really? Me after trailer: Dude I can't wait for this!
Plz get Matthew lillard on this movie
who love scary movie 1?
💥💥
One parson do dress up like scream 😱*and said you kill my own father*
I love how they bring it back to Stu’s old house, the house that defied the strength of garage doors. That better be where the movie ends.
scream 5 stu's vendetta
Now this is scream
"Whassuuuuuuuuuuuup"
Very much looking forward to this. I wasn’t crazy about Scream 4, but this looks to have many more elements of the original trilogy in it.
See, this wouldn’t be a problem if ppl had guns… mans chinging ppl down like it’s the UK
Wow, this actually looks scary. A definite surprise coming from this series
I remember seeing the first one in the theater 😊
So excited to see this movie 🎥
RIP Wes Craven! Can't wait to see this one.
I just started to watch the scream series in July and I wanted a new one to come out so bad and now I’m so hyped
My Man ain't no Simp!!!
My favorite slasher is back BABY!!
Hail to the king, Wes Craven! R.i.p.
is it acceptable to scream in the theater for this one
Who is it this time, her mother? Imagine the twist, if she wasn't dead all this time
Its always the blackboy that cant run with the highschool jacket
"I won't sleep until _he's_ in the ground."   *Plot Twist:* It's a female or multiple ppl (again) 😆
Scream 4
At 0:24 she already has her blouse cut haha. Maybe it's after she was cut?
yay all of the old cast are back!
A more vicious and serious Ghostface?! COUNT ME IN! They removed all the comedy and stuck with the horror element for this. Great move. I'm hyped now!
❤️❤️❤️
YES!
This is cool but when is Hollywood gonna make more horror movie villains instead of just rebooting the same shit over and over again 💀
so hollywood etc are officially out of ideas for anything original.
Is no one going to mention that at 2:04 Sidney is in Stus house from the first movie
Clay Jensen
I was about to leave then I saw Sydney and the old crew 😝. I'm glad it's not a reboot
Seen it all before
Am watching just because Dylan minnette is in it
Wazzuuuuup
I've never watched a horror movie cause I shit myself only with the trailers, but this looks awesome, so, I'll have to watch the other 4. Oh god
Scream 3: scr3am Scream 4: scre4m Scream 5: 5cream
Wow, never seen a scream film. I’ll be watching them now tho so I know what happening before I see this one at the cinema. Amazing trailer
So excited for this!!! Cant wait to watch it🔪🔪🔪
💯
I can't wait!!!
That girl at the start really should have backed up into a wall so he couldn't jump from behind.... If she spent her time running and growing a pair she would have made it. Scream is not huge..you'd think a smash over the head with a vase would be enough...roll credits.
Tenemos a una latina, que orgullo ! ❤️‍🔥
Boring
They should've just named the title for this one 5cream
Why can’t they just call it scream 5
I said, don't disturb me when I'm cleaning my room!
The first movie was awesome. Yeah, I like the first one. Didn’t need anymore after that. $$$$
Finally the scream is back!!!!! :D <3 <3 <3 I missed it!!! :) <3 <3 <3
*Thinking to myself that I need therapy because I’m grinning like a kid in a candy store while watching a girl get scared for her life and possibly murdered by ghostface in the beginning of the trailer* 🥴🥴
Scream after watching squid games:  “Would you like to play a game”
I came to see Deweeeeyyy♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
Maybe it's cause I'm a huge Scream fan and my expectations and hype are high but this trailer did nothing for me. It actually might have brought the hype and expectations down. Didn't think this trailer looked good right from the beginning or even even felt like scream while watching it. And the January release doesn't help those concerns. Hoping it's still awesome cause I'll still be watching lol. Sidenote, is Jenna Ortega gonna be the Drew Barrymore of this movie? Cause I was hoping she'd be a main character in the movie
Poor Sid can’t catch a break
GhostFace in  present era.  all that hi technology to lock all doors is so useless.
After scary movie, original is funny :)
its always "something about this one just feels different" 😭
yay the horror movie of horror movie cliches is getting another film 10 years too late for me also scream the series was horrible
🧀-y
New Halloween movies, new scream movies new IT movies  Give us a new nightmare on elm street and Friday the 13th whilst ur at it.
this trailer will singlehandedly get me through the rest of 2021.
*I wish the plot is that SYDNEY has PTSD or Bi-Polar and she turns out to be GHOST FACE without knowing that she's ghost face.* Another random person, or revisit from the past wouldn't be that interesting unless it was interconnected with numerous people like Billy's father, or Dewey, or Gale. If she had PTSD, then she could go on a rampage, and then she could escape from Dewey in the final kill-scene, and then be found the next morning by Dewey and he discovers a wound in a specific spot and with blood linking her to the crime etc.
The series was awesome too
Thats Me!
Stu is alive!
can't wait
Jensen's in trouble again! Or is he?
Scream but: m o d e r n
The killer really walking towards Dewey while he is reloading
What a nice family movie
Not another one
https://youtu.be/gN07zYleKUo
I was hoping they’d go the Wes Cravens New Nightmare route. Have it in ‘real life’.
This shit gon be good
Hoping Jill and Kirby make a surprise comeback 😁 From a script of Scream 5 that I read a couple years ago and a quick look at the cast list and viewing of whos mainly missing in the trailer, I'm pretty sure I know who one (because theres usually two) of the Ghostfaces are and which one of the original three is most likely gonna die...😳
All that with a knife
This trailer made my day 😍
Pov: Dewey finally comes out as the killer
This means there will be another Scary Movie!!! Wassssssssssuuuuuupppppppppppppp!!!!!!!!
Omg 😍 😲 😱
Ngl I thought it was saw
You know all generations are gonna be watching this🙂
This looks gay as fuck. Thats why i have a gun
I love the motive for the new killer, tbh.
So excited for the return of my favorite horror icon!!
Hmmm..... Scary Movie : Part __ 😉 😊
I'm Excited Assff Cannot Wait !!!!!!!!!!!!
I just feel like at this point just let it go to voicemail?? Who has time.
You know how long I've been waiting for this greatness 👏🏾👏🏾
I can’t wait to WATCH👀 this!
Hope the movie doesn’t suck as much as the trailer does
another rehash of what's done before and this time without the involvement of Wes Cravem RIP
Finally a sequel that is not funny
Classic !
yo at the begenning of the trailer i have one of them landlines
I can’t believe my eyes we got Halloween and now scream!?!?!? BUT… can we get a Friday the 13th!?!?!? Not tryna push it
now why the hell would she open the door? 🙁
This looks terrible
Its 2021 and people  still have house phones???...wow...lol 🤣🤣
Sidney has a gun but not an iphone
Halloween, Scream, and the new Chucky tv series !?!?!? YESSSSIRRR !
1:12 so good idk why they never did a shot like that before
Can't wait to scream again! This looks very dark!!
Yo Alexia; lock all doors. Did you say play Leave the door open by bruno mars 😱.
I thought this was scary movie. Now I am depressed
Nicely played holding back the jokes.
I might give this a chance. It gives off a very Cobra Kai-like vibe to it. Bringing back the original characters mixed in with the new ones. It most certainly has the slasher/horror movie element to it.
I have a feeling Stu survived in the first Scream, and he’s the back for revenge! 🔪
OH MY GOD FINALLY
This looks legit .....FINALLY!!!!😀😀😃😄😁😆
Is that Hughie?! Ghostface is fucked
Scary
hey can you make a sequal of super 8?
These days, you gotta have a sequel. hehe
I swear if Dewey gets stabbed, I'm never paying taxes again
I literally cannot wait oh my gosh
YES Ghostface looks normal again!! Really disliked how he looked in the Scream series
What the hell is it a reboot don't seem it but it's just named scream again and didn't they already reboot this once I'm so lost with these films now
"would you like to play a game"   wrong movie
clay from 13 reasons why!!!
sux!!!
Can’t wait I love the scream franchise
This scary movie is a legend.
Neve Campbell still hot.
I don't understand how I horror character could wear so much material
Looks great, ngl
this is mf coooooooool
I thought scream was scary movie
our generation is gonna love this one 💀
Generic
Is this a follow up to all previous movies? Or is it pulling a Halloween (2018)?
Cant wait
Hmmm....no cancel culture, no pc culture, no woke culture, no propaganda..... seems safe to watch.
Soooooo who tf is related to the original killers 🤨🤨🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤔🤔??? Cuz that’s like 5-6 people related to like 2 people soo um someone help me with. That answer plz ??
The girl with the purple-ish red ish hair said the attack were all on people related to the original killers but??? How explain them I will get orrrr am I gonna have to watch all of the Screans again?? Just to find out ???
this is the plot of IT chapter 2
Curious question because I’ve seen all of them but how are the attacks in this trailer related to the people that are killing the new people how are they related to the killers Siri original killers in 1996 how are they  in away related ????
It's been a long time. SCREAM.
I have a feeling this movie is going to be really bad XD
I don’t think I can watch another of these. It’s just the same concept now 5 times. I duno
The 1st Scream Movie 🎥 in the 90's was the Best when I was a Kid 😷
Omfg this looks incredible I’m so hyped for next year it’s gonna be so dope!
Why?
If they kill any of the original cast I will walk out of the theaters MARK MY WORDS
I feel like I've seen this movie before.
-->https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSkV2jxoRVVlyohxphQK-S9R
Scream 2 was the darker .... but seeing this ! ..... Can´t wait!!! Looks amazing!
I'm sure Sydney must be so annoyed with all these killers dressing up in Ghostface costumes trying to kill her, and this has been happening all since 1996. MAN she cannot catch a break!
Meh
Sidney is the strongest scream queen I know .. Laurie strode is strong too .. but Sidney went through and continues to go through some shit 😂🤦🏾‍♀️ … I can’t wait to see this 🔪❤️
ITS BACK GUYS THEY ARE BACK
Why the hell call this Scream? It's a continuation. They did this was Haloween as well. Don't get that choice
Where is the scream niche where the killer calls Sid, Dewey, or Gale and whatever ghostface said was enough for that character to commit suicide.  And then the mystery of ghostface AND the mystery of what was said was the story
Don't kill Dewey bruh
*****YOU KNOW WHATS ACTUALLY SCARY?*****  Just the LITTLE detail,that’s an Easter egg from the FIRST scream. Where Sydney says”she should be going out the front door,instead of upstairs.”  And the girl in the beginning,her FIRST Initial instinct was, ”fuck this!I’m not playing this game,on the phone,with you!”, and goes out the FRONT door! Which she’s opens,and the killer is already waiting there,and cuts her.  If that gives ANY hint to what this movie’s expectations are.i think the killer(s) are the smartest one(s),in the whole franchise(in the killing/hunting sense).where they’ve studied the past murders,maybe even read Gail’s books on them and know how their victim(s) will react when they’re HUNTED.  So I think THIS movie is gonna be the opposite..like the killer is always a few steps ahead and will probably actually succeed in killing literally,almost everyone..maybe even Sydney included…basically,this might be the one where the “killer”,wins.
Holy shit 1:56 is the original house…
I shall kill dewey first then gale then Sydney
Dewey has to be the killer here. He has all thr motive...Sidney was responsible for his sister's death in the original Scream. Because he and his sister were friends with Sidney- they were both constantly targeted by Ghostface. I think he needs to be the killer now or in one of the sequels! BTW, the Chucky series on Syfy for Halloween is goddamn scary! 🎃
this will give halloween kills a run for it’s money.
I would love to play a game, scream.
YAAAAAAAS! It’s back baby!
What’s your favorite scary movie?
"Waaaaazaaaaap"~ Ghostface probably
I’m calling it right now. Stu is the killer in this movie.
They gonna kill Jenna that fast
It’s been doofy all along
Why?
NICE😲😲
_Special Officer Doofy reporting_
You got that on film yes I got that on film
In my house, i know enough places where no-one can find me😂.
I love scream and this looks dope so far  please don’t fuck this up 🖤
We can't wait!
https://youtu.be/bR3sJZdKkM0
It’s aight.
great another remake
Either make Dewey the killer or kill Dewey. It’s time.
No sexuality??
A more vicious and serious Ghostface?! COUNT ME IN! They removed all the comedy and stuck with the horror element for this. Great move. I'm hyped now!

SCREAM | OFFICIAL TRAILER (2022 MOVIE) REACTION https://youtu.be/LQiOUPDQ2IE
jokes on u, i cant be scared of ghostface if i find him attractive
WHATSS SUPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!
the millennial/gen x nostalgia is making ppl forget this is a january release and won’t be good why take off the comedy that’s what made the og good
Looks great.
This one looks darker/less funny than the others.
Cool looks good
Hey Google, lock all doors.  Google: What's your favorite scary movie
“Whatever his link is to our past, he’s pulled us all back here” There’s NO WAY Stu’s not the killer, or at least one of the killers!!!
More menacing & dark, Ghost face has that torturous slow kill agenda !
looks alright.
Lmao they don’t know what else to do anymore but do reboots 🤣
Run out of new ideas just make shitty remakes
That fact it’s it release in my birthday is kinda spooky
Can’t wait 🔥
Ha! I'm not scared! It's one of the Wayne's brothers under that mask!🤣
hi
Meh 🧑🏻‍💻
Jesus Christ I feel old now 1996 ? Good times in high school taking dates to see this and then calling them hahahaha - Bring back my guy Stu !
I’m calling it now Dewey finally gets killed *drops mic*
That’s why you don’t have electric locks on your door
I am so hyped
I'm stoked
Yuck
Why not before Halloween?!
Why?
Well yes ITS AN HONOR TO KILL SIDNEY, DO U KNOW HOW MANY KILLERS RELATED TO HER TRIED TO KILL HER
I think Ghostface is gonna be one of the cast OG's estranged children or something since they're old enough now
Tell me your movie is shit without telling me your movie is shit….  “this January…”
It might be Dylan Minnete’s character
And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, Jesus said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
Make more SCREAM
OMG. This looks awesome
Looking like it's going to be a darker movie 😯
11 years of patience have I done for this series, this don't look disappointing so far
Ortega playing the Barrymore opening.  Ok
The first one was by far the best. I doubt this one will be as good I mean I will definitely watch it but I won't be too surprised if it disappoints me. We'll see
Guarantee new Ghost is a woman. Everything about this "screams" cliche.
As long as there is no social justice, feminist, woke bs. I'll give it a shot.
Now this has my attention. LETS GO!
oh dis looks terrible
Scary movie 🍿
Not “he’s a fucking human bean” Clay in this 😩
This is going to be legendary!
Imagine all classic slashers remade for the 21th century? They already made one with Jason in 2009 or 11, but maybe, they can come back again.
why they gotta kill jenna ortega
Ghostface better be careful, Hughie's killed superheroes 🤣
I wonder who ghost face is going to be?🤔
wow I know a better way to watch this. just watch the first one and then you don't have to pay extra for a copy of a movie. wow. brilliant
EVERYONE LOOKUP "Gematria Effect News 22"
DYLAN MINETTE
The way he breaks horror movie tropes by just immediately trying to kill her as soon as she opens the door and not standing there for 10 seconds
this didn’t even come out yet but i’m already ready for scream 6!!
I'm... worried that this movie is gonna be a butchering of the original premise of Scream. Each Scream movie was supposed to parody what happens to horror movies at certain entries in a franchise, and I have no idea where this new entry will fit into what Scream's concept is going for. It's probably gonna be a good stand-alone horror movie, but not a good Scream movie, perse
And that… is why only an idiot connects their home security to their phone. Your Facebook account gets hacked every other Tuesday, but for some reason you still feel safe putting your door locks on your phone? Moron….
you already know thats the original killers nephew
Let’s go boys ghostface is back baby
Man Neve Campbell got old
i was really hopeing they bring back the WASSAAAPPP
Want to play a game Sidney
Killer is randy. Calling it
What a great commericial to stop everyone from making their home smart with the way it unlocks lol
Oh damn. It was terrifying how the doors automatically unlocked via an app. Ghost Face has upped his game.
Lame
Oh shit this about to go down
fuck yes deconsctruct those tropes! Do this justice, be aware that its a reboot, please my self aware horror child needs to come back the tv series was a disgrace, this is perfect to give commentary on all the reboot sequels we get much like how the remake did remeber "dont fuck with the original"
Wow, yet another super-lazy cash grab, re-make.
It’s an honor… 😱
it back  hell yeah
Just shoot him with an ar ? Idiots
Whazzaaaap
All males are shown getting attacked .. Richie, Dewey, Chad and Vince. I HAVE NO DOUBT THE KILLERS ARE FEMALE IN THIS ONE
IDK...this feels like a parody
You do not stray from the Craven playbook whrn making a Scream!
Who uses landlines anymore?
Thank god. Wes would be so 😊 Sidney, Gale , Dewey we will all be there for you in theatres as always. Cant wait!!!!!! This is the Scream im talking about!!!
Courtney Cox has messed her face up. Everyone else looks great.
No way Sidney - and the other guy - I thought he was the bad guy ?????
Looks crap, very cheap. Also Why do the casts in new movies like so boring, bland and generic. Its always the most generic looking zoomers and millennials.
Do better. Make your own movies.
WAAZUUUPP
Spoiler Dewey is the killer or whatever his name is
hahaha, im dead
Wowwww!!!! Excelente
yes please
I can remember back in Dec of 96’ when the very first Scream movie released. Theaters we’re so packed people sat all on the stairs to see the movie. Good ole days this movie has that vibe.
SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAM
I know it'd be a bit of an eyeroller, but I'm secretly hoping Billy's ghost is actually ghostface coming back to finish the job
I thought this was scary movie real quick 😂
It's SCREAM 5 BABY!!!!!!!
https://youtu.be/3PQU0Jhv0ZQ
Really good trailer. I hope the movie is great
How to beat Scream:      Move to a different country
Plot twist the killer is a “She”
A more vicious and serious Ghostface?! COUNT ME IN! They removed all the comedy and stuck with the horror element for this. Great move. I'm hyped now!
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  1 John 5:13  These things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may KNOW that ye have ETERNAL LIFE, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
Wait what, what are they going comment on this time?
Did Gen Z thought they were a exemption from SCREAM?
I'm surprised this actually looks really good
Did you just spoil the first scene and more than two deathes and maybe the killer?
January 14(? 💔
"Hey Google, lock all doors!" "Unlocking all doors." "NO, lock all doors!" "Doors unlocked, goodbye Sidney."
Looks boring same old,should of left it alone IMO
Spoiler, someone's gonna die
A screaming movie: once the vision starts, it will be difficult to save himself 2:11
Another remake… no wonder people don’t pay to see movies anymore.
probably going to be an halfass shit soulless remake.
Stu Macher's house 🏠 from the original...I'm calling Shaggy here.
WHAZZZZUPPPPPPPPPP
Can’t wait for the ‘Scary Movie’ version
Neve Campbell is still 🔥
It's probably a woman under the mask
I feel like we saw half the cast who died
https://youtube.com/channel/UCkggDEF39U30rJDayx4fxYQ
FAVORITE HORROR FRANCHISE!!
this genuinely looks promising
So excited for this !!!
Stu is back !
Laurie Strode vs Sydney Prescott  Book it dana!
This movie is gonna make people wanna improve their security systems
Looks good for meeeeeeeee
My favorite movie coming out with a part 5 I’m so excited
Wish it was this October!!
DEPUTY JUDY
Have you seen this Horror Short - https://youtu.be/AZJcCxnbiDI
FUCK YEAH
01:56 is that stu’s house? stu and jack quaid the killers leaving this here
100 bucks says that Ghostface is a woman
This looks stupid trash. Bro why do they keep remaking movies that should not be remastered. Smfh 🚮🚮
I'll pass. Slasher movies been played out.
I'm gonna just put my guess as to who the killers are here. 1. Stu - Because Matthew Lillard has said on many occasions that Stu was supposed to be the original killer in Scream 3, but due to the Columbine shooting they scrapped that idea, they could possibly be going back to Cravens previous idea. Also the Macher home will most likely be where the final showdown will take place...what better place for revenge then the place that Billy and Stu were beat by Sidney and Gale. 2. Vince - Because he looks so much like Billy Loomis down to the hair and even goatee that Billy rocks in the Sceam poster. Also his last name is being hidden for a reason, we know everyone's last name except for his. Stu is out for revenge and could have Vince as his accomplice possibly playing off some sort of Hate towards the people who murdered his father or something along those lines. If Vince does turn out to be a Loomis   then this guy will have so much potential having his Father and Grandmother as previous Ghostface killers.
Wazzzzuuppppppppp!?!!!!
Romans 1:28-32 (KJV)  And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.
Scream an chucky  Its a good day to be alive
Another scream movie?????? Jesus Christ how many of these movies are they gonna make
I remember when I first saw scream as a kid. I will be 22 when this movie comes out. Can' believe the nostalgia horror film like this is coming back.
Courtney Cox and Neve Campbell looks great for their age.
Wazzzzzapppppp
😍😍😍😍😍😍READYYY
Another one
Qué ganas de esta nueva entrega. Ghostface con su mítico traje me encanta. Y confío en los directores de Ready or Not.  Sé que hay mucho cariño al trío original, pero siento que algo impactante que golpearía mucho emocionalmente sería cargarse a uno de ellos, para así comenzar a dar paso a nuevos personajes con más peso y entrar a ser referentes en nuevas películas. No sé, así lo veo. Aunque nunca de los nunca mataría a Sidney, ella es lo que Jamie Lee Curtis es para Halloween.
Ohhhhh I’m ready 😫💓
Oh gee, another reboot.
Wait is ghostface killing all the relatives of the previous killers?
It gives me the chills!! Stu´s house!!!!
shit from 90s
Neve Campbell looking good....
all the top comments seem suuuuuuuuuper fake
Fuck yeah!!!!!
At this point I think Sydney has to be in 30 more
Always a great idea to give sequels the same title as the original
Finally Ghostface isn’t a twat
mmm intersting
Yassssss... I feel like I'm in a high school reunion and now having a flashback of the first film. 90s style. Hello, Sidney.
Dude!!!!! They brought back doowy
Looks good feels like the 90s a little
Too much info.
Hello Sidney…….it’s an honor two different lines not said at the same time hmmm
Ah yes one of my favorite killers
Hey look! Another shitty reboot that never needed to happen.  Cinema is lost forever
BORING
Lol. Same old same old
Supernatural this time? Maybe?
If you're reading this 17 years, 8 weeks, 3 days from now, this is an amazing movie series. 😱🔪
Imagine if this movie surpasses the og one, looking at the trailer it defo has the potential to be the greatest scream movie although the first movie did change the horror genre and is regarded as one of the greatest horror movies ever so its gon be a tuff challenge
Wes Craven would be proud
Scream is back! I can't wait to see it at the theater!
Omg best horror movie series of all time
Nice Nice Nice!!
Wazzaaaaaap!
People have guns & you're telling me this movie last  more than a hr 🙄
Pardon me for asking.... But i can't find horror in it.....
Finally, theyre remaking yet ANOTHER horror movie
I can never get enough of scream
Scream 1 is the best one 😎🎃
What if Sidney got pregnant from sleeping with billy lumis, and in between scream 1 and 2 she gave the baby boy up for adoption, he’s never been seen or heard of since…. Until now! Back to finish what his father started! Boom! Take me to Hollywood baby!
looks good
Loved the original scream movies. So happy the old cast is coming back😁
The cast doesn’t seem to have the same sparkle, wit & sex appeal as the original?...and the magic/ attitude of the 90’s is hard to compete with...
This looks awful 🤣
Is this a reboot of Scream or Scream 5? If the title only says Scream then it must be a reboot surely.
Was hoping for october
This looks amazing. I have the first three Screams on dvd. I’ll have to rewatch them before this comes out!
HELLO SIDNEY!
i hope they dont fuck this up
We all know Jenna is gonna die first 🤣
Sound likes stu ❤️🥰
WAZZAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This is why you shouldn't answer the phone or have a smart house
Please don’t kill off Syd in this movie. She’s definitely another Jamie Lee Curtis.   The original who has survived all the Screams.
yall smoking dogshit?
🇱🇾🔥🔱
It actually looks good but why did they have to call it Scream? Now I have to be like "have you seen Scream?" and people will be like "which one? The 1997 version or 2022 version."
the girl with the pink hair name is liv makenzie and might be possible that she is the daughter of the makenzies mentioned in the beginning of the first scream
Surprised they didn't make him transgender or bisexual
Why is this coming out in January and not on Halloween, feels like a wasted opportunity
Cant wait to see it!
Unpopular opinion but Neve Campbell is a thousand times hotter than Courtney Cox to me
Pretty sure, everyone will die but Sydney will somehow still survive..
Oh yes! This looks SO GOOD
Why it isnt just called scream 5?
What is this crap
Под пиво пойдет
I am sorry, but it is only me that I cannot take this horror series seriously? I mean the killer looks very goofy to me.
Neve is queen.
thank god they’re dumping that shitty tv show they had going for a bit
This one seem more scarier to me
Spoiler........Its stifler.
0:21 "WHATS UUUUUUUUUPP??😝"
No Way Its Been Years!!!! And Finally!!! Its a new #ScreamMovie
Ghost face: want to play a game Saw: hey thats my line.
Sidney has always been my favorite final girl. I wrote a college paper on her and why she's the perfect example of a final girl. One of my favorite research papers.
It’s literally the new Halloween storyline ?
Oh boy😒 same old scream
It’s cool to see the original actors coming back
Damn trailer gave so much away like 3 kills and a damn twist that the killers after people who are related to the original victims.
Color me impressed, I wasn't going to get my hopes up but this trailer actually started to get me to look forward to this.
Prediction: Dewey or Gail are gonna bite the dust
Finally ! 🎃
OH HELL YEAH!!!!! IVE DRESSED UP AS GHOSTFACE FOR 11 YEARS
The killer is gonna be someone close to sidney and wes
You ANTIFA/BLM low life morons are the ones who are always screaming that the U.S. is systemically racist, but then you expect blacks to trust a vaccine that the government is forcing on them?????🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  There were hundreds of blacks protesting against vaccine mandates in Atlanta a few weeks ago, and CNN called them white supremacists just like they did to Larry Elder!  When they got called out for it, they changed their story and tried to say that it was BLM protesting against racial injustice!  You people are nothing but heinous lying scum and everybody hates you!  Nobody likes you and nobody supports you!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣...auzuz
ANTIFA/BLM scum keep telling blacks that the U.S. is systemically racist against them, so now they refuse to get the vaccine because they don't trust the government, which means they're being segregated again and can't enter the same businesses as white people!  This is the same state whose Congressmen said that forcing black people to show ID to vote is racist, but forcing them to show a COVID passport to enter a store or a restaurant is perfectly fine!  Black people in LA rioted over Rodney King, but they're totally cool with racist segregation and Jim Crow laws coming back?  Only citizens have the right to vote, so you show your ID to prove that you're a CITIZEN!  Also, Biden can send teams door-to-door to help blacks get vaccinated, but he can't send teams out to help them get an ID to vote?  Better yet, he can't send teams door-to-door to make sure voters are still alive or otherwise eligible to vote?  Why doesn't Biden issue one of his executive orders to force all states to provide free IDs to everybody?????....ahsjz
I thought it is scary movie part 1 remake something and I was laughing all the time watching this trailer 🤣
:)
I've made the most clickbate VIDEO!!! CHECKOUT!!!
Omfg I loved it
In those 10 years, scream has been training himself to become a hacker.
waaaasssssuuuuuuppppppp
I love how Courtney Cox' face has more plastic than Ghostface's mask.
It’s October once again 🎃👻
This looks fresh.  I’m here for it.  😱🔪  So glad Sid, Gale, and Dewey are back.  Better with age!  🧡
Sidney's really giving off those Lethal Weapon "I'm too old for this shit" vibes in this.  Can't wait for January.
Land lines in 2k22 oof
https://youtu.be/yO25DLTeJPU
Are you lot out of ideas?
Reboot it, renew it Reshoot it, redo it And reuse it, retool it Abuse it, just do it If you wanna make some easy cash, just recycle and rehash
The fact that he said "would you like to play a game" instead of "whats your favorite scary movie" makes me mad when it shouldn't be
They should bring back shaggy and skeet
Not- I Scream? Just, Scream. Ooookaay.. Ookay.
WAAAAAAAZZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
Am I missing something? I thought it was a parody of horror movie.
So excited
this is like what they’re doing with the halloween movies rn
Yessss
Hallelujah
yes _       bye
WAZZUp Scary movie
this looks promising
I feel I'm being "Ghosted"! Ha...
If you upvoted this go grab the clorox.
What you betting douie or gail is the killer 🤣
Scariest thing in the trailer is Courtney Cox face.
I’ve seen too many parodies of him to feel scared
I was watching a video and this came on and I thought this was an ad for a home security system til i kept watching.
super
this is so exciting! who is waiting with me?
Jenna no😢
Scary Movie completely ruined scream for me 😂 Doofy, smell my fingers!
Why isn’t Jenna ortega the protagonist???? 🥲
Barrel scraping hollyweird
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK ✅ 😱
Waaaaaazzzzzzzzzuuuuuuuuppppppppp!
I could be wrong but I think Jack Quaid and Mikey Madison are the killers based on this trailer 🤷🏽‍♂️
All right, another Scary Movie! ... Oh, wait, you mean this isn't a parody...? Could've fooled me.
Hope this is going to be good!
Landline in 2022 ??? Hahahaa yea right
This is why I will never ever, ever have a smart house. Alexa is not going to control my locks.
Surprise Sidney! Long time…no see!
Jesus christ everything is a fucking remake nowadays
Wasssssssss upppppppppppp
I cant wait to see the original cast back again got a repeat!!
Just fyi Mathew Lillard ( Stu) is 6’4 and this killer is tall af… do whatever you want with that information
AHHHHHHHHHH I CANT WAIT
Scream  vs halloween kills vs chucky  .🎃💀🖤❤🖤
No thats all i have to say is no
Damn I can’t take this seriously after watching Scary Movie 🤣🤣
lmfao this is exactly the same thing Halloween is doing.
what happened to courntey cox's face jfc
You know Sidney is ready when she says of course she has a gun. I’m definitely ready for this new Scream.
Garbáge.
SLASHER FILMS.ARE BACK BABY!!!!  And f*ck all of you young bloodz if you dont like this movie
I couldn't be more excited for this movie! David Arquette looks amazing!
And I like the way when Ghostface say want to play a game instead of saying do you like scary movie by the way that's a Chucky reference
ohhh shit I'm watching this video exactly at 9:38 pm! 🤠
Shit gave me chills ngl
What about the Wazzzzup?!
Cash grab?
Fuuuuuuucccccccckkkkkk yeeeeaaaaahhhhh!!! Bitvh I'm hype!!!
Yeah!!!!
This has scream 1&2 vibes. Serious and dark.
Omg, omg!!!!!!!! My favorite moveee !!!!! My childhood came to life !!!! I can't wait for the movie people !!!! 👁👁🦻
Please don’t make this suck
INK really needs to be be the score writers
For some reason I feel like it may be Wes as the killer. I didn't see him at all get attacked in the trailer.
Who's here from Call of Duty
WWWAAAAAAZZZZZZ UUUUUUPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!
I hope Dead Meat saw this trailer
I low key thought when I first saw this I was going to see a meme lmfao
Crisp 👏
50 seconds went by and I'm scared as hell already ! Can't f wait !!! ❤️
AMIZING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this will most likely get lost in the comments but this version of scream reminds me of the ghost face in the game dead by daylight where he is a very cautious person but still has a flare to him like the old movies but this one just seems like he is doing it for fun
Really?!?
I thought it was the parody one!
Ok Ms harleyyy I see u not stuck in the middle anymore
Okay Sydney's dead mom better pop out from behind that mask or something lol. I really won't feel the impact if it's a brand new character.
WHATS WITH ALL THESE MOVIES LOOKING SO HORRIBLE AND LIKE INDIE MOVIES MADE BY HIGHSCHOOLERS?
im sorry but a dude with a knife and a bunch of people with a gun and he survives its not a good movie
A horror movie in January. Well, I mean, I guess not wanting to make money is *a* strategy.
Really good!!
Scream is neter the same after all the comedy paradys.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_9tfGWurMU
I liked her more in Friends 🤣
The reason why they don’t star men in these movies is because they wouldn’t just stand in the Fucking hallway screaming and crying while not moving upstairs to barricade yourself in then jump out of the window 🤡🤡🤡
So what the plot? There’s like 6 scream movies and the story is just lost, so is the movie just all blood and gore? Seems boring
Halloween kills, Spiderman no way home and then scream 5 nice
I love sydney :)
Hell yeah
Muy duro se parece a este  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0OPtFUIUvaQ
Surprise Sidney!!!!!!
This blow's
Did you really find her liver in the mailbox 📫 cuz I heard they found her liver in the mailbox right next to her spleen & Pancreas
omg i cant wait for this squeal
"Cause let's face it baby, these days, YOU GOTTA HAVE THE SEQUEL!!!"
Wwwwwwwwaaaaaassssssssuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupppppppppp
The fact that this comes out in January tells me everything I need to know about the movie
Please don’t kill off Syd in this movie. She’s definitely another Jamie Lee Curtis.   The original who has survived all the Screams.
Did she serious open the door?🤣but I cant wait
Couldn't be more scarier than both political parties
omfg i’m so excited
In Stab 5 there was time travel. Will there be time travel in Scream 5?)
I was sooooo happy when I saw Sidney!
NOT AGAIN? I mean REALLY?! This is tiresome.
This trailer is great. I get the feeling this new film will be more terrifying than previous installments. Scream has always blended horror and meta humour with varying success; hopefully they have got the mix right in this new film that is the first in the series to not feature the late, great Wes Craven.
Potential spoiler: That looks like ghostface on fire in that one shot. My prediction is they’re not going to be able to identify who the killer was after being burned so badly and it’ll set up the next movie.
SCREAM/GHOSTFACE HAS RETURNED
I hope this Ghostface is a master of Krav Maga that would make him or and her or and them even more frightening yeah
1:23 bruh I can already tell it’s this girl bruh, just saved you an hour and a half
WAZZZZZAAAAAAA!!!
Ouh please i so like this movie🔥🔥🔥
Looks like Dewey and Gail are broken up again
I just love it when I get the notification that says "someone has liked your comment" or "someone has subscribed!" ❤😍 makes my day. 💬":'
So many great movies coming out this year and next year, I'm really hoping a classic slasher movie gets released soon *cough* Friday the 13th *cough*
bro if the killer isn't Stu... 😭 Matthew Lillard has been wanting to do it for so long
Honestly 1:26 is probably the best shot in this trailer
Hi strangers we may not know each other but I just want to wish you all the best in life.  Overcome failures, never give up and you will succeed in life!
all these comments reading like paid actors, with peace and love.
In theaters 1.14.22
wow this is absolutely incredible
Boring wanted all new story
HAVING THE KILLER GO AFTER RELATIVES OF THE PREVIOUS KILLERS IS AN AMAZING CONCEPT!!! And hearing the killer tell Sidney it’s an Honor!!! FUCKING CHILLS!!! Here’s to hoping that they don’t mess it up! 😈
Another Parody loading
10 bucks it’s Kirby.
I feel like Ortega is gonna get over used within movies for a few years like the rock and Kevin hart and she her career is gonna die out
Fuck yeah 🤘🏽😝
I think scream is a female cuz why not
Not released during halloween month? Disappointed.

After so many years, he's finally back
Please don't fill it with PC Sjw propaganda.
Hello everyone, I am going to comment on the possible plot of this New movie; Since West has always made us think and analyze his past movies to discover the murderer. Well, very simply, the murderer has to be a fan of Sydney, someone who appreciates her very much, and well the police, officer Judy (Dewey Riley's partner) is the murderer and loves Sydney so much that she decides to end all that suffering of Sidney, making the relatives of the original killers pay in the same way. Simple. I am Donny Varper, singer and above all # 1 SCREAM fan. Cosmic Blessings.

Looks good. One thing tho.. who tf has landlines still??
steady soul this is a thrilling film. It makes your heart skip a beat... oooh spooky😬😬😬😬😬
WAZZZUP! wait wrong movie
“I told you not to bother me when I’m cleaning my room”!
Time to have a Scream marathon for the 10000 time!!!
I think the killer is someone that's at least 6'5 tall.
K but why is this literally bringing me to the verge of tears from the roundhouse kick to the face with nostalgia it just gave me 🖤🖤🖤
The things of this world don’t last! God doesn’t want this type of attachment to earthly things for you! Repent and trust in Jesus! He is the only way you will be saved! Have a blessed day whoever sees this and please repent!❤️🥰🙏🙌🤲
It's gonna be woke!
How fucking dare they put this as an January release
Wow i feel old this is why u don't hook up your house locks to the internet
Kinda cool they brought back the original cast
Should have been released near Halloween
PERFECT 👌 THANKS ❤️
I was in my early teens when the first one come out, now I'm in my mid thirties and excited as then. I'm all for this.
but...but... WHY?!
Awesome !
Been waiting for 10years
Do not want
FINALLY edit: just seen it’s a January horror movie 😓
Scream returning in 2022 be like WAAAASSSUUUUUUUUPPPP
Damn. He sounds like the Freddy from the 2010 nightmare on elm street. A little cringe, but to be expected that his voice would've changed by now.
Badass !!!! Lets go
I'm waitinggggggg.....on the sonic the hedgehog 2 trailer or sum newsssss
DUUUDE!
Shows way too much
I’m not usually a fan of horror movies but this one has my attention
Why is it coming out in January not October? It would have been perfect to release it this month for Halloween
I wonder if they'll make a nod to the MTV scream, it could be a jumpscare by someone wearing the lakewood slasher mask or a poster for a Stab movie could features the lakewood slasher, maybe a stab series, after all being meta was a part of the original scream
Wwaasssssssssssuuuuuuuuuuuppppppppppppppppp
❤️
It’s being released in January. What does that tell you ?
Nice
Yikes. I bet the killer is the kid from one of the old killers
Wohooo can't wait for this!!! And also how come Courteney and Neve still look so young? They're still pretty
if its a sequel why does it have the same title as the original`?
doesn't look funny at all.....wtf, the rules are supposed to be obviously broken.....where's the scary scream comedy.....I'll watch Jason for out and out horror.
Wazzzzz upppppppppp
Moi je ferme l électricité.... un objectif de protection .... pis je te fini en 10 minutes... j espère le monde vont pas aller voir cette choses redondant.... merci
“Hello, Sydney.” OH MY GOD! THE CHILLS!
@Paramount Pictures  For the love of God, call it "Scream 5"! That's what it is! It's another sequel, not a remake, so, logically, it should be called "Scream 5"! Enough with these stupid film titles, Hollywood! "The Final Destination"(as opposed to "Final Destination 4"), "Halloween"[2018], "The Predator", and "Scream"[2022]?! Give me a break!
I absolutely can not wait 🤭👏🏼
0:26 lol idk why but the way he slashed her and the way she slammed the door had me dead.
This look stupid
Movies, knife always beats the gun. Irl knife assailant shot dead, self-defense shooter arrested just cus they live in commiefornia, after self-defense shooting, dems throw more gun control cus "fuck your constitutional rights" is the movie name.
Now that he’s brought them all back I wonder who the killer really is. Is it Stu Mocker, Billy Loomis that they said was going to be coming back, or is it somebody new that’s picking up where Ghostface left off at
So this means theres going to be a scary movie rebot? F*CK YEA!
If the doors are unlocked why doesn't she just run out?!
I couldn't take it seriously
Terra: *gets stabbed* Also terra: eVeRyThInG iS fInE
The original scream was my favorite movie as a kid.  I had people calling me sid as  a nick name lol. I was a dork. Even memorized the script to the movie
OK, we saw a brief look of Gail screaming and being held back near an ambulance. . . My bet's they either stabbed her man AGAIN, or he's dead.
whaaaazzzzuuuuppp
Scream : New movie Me, an intellectual : WAZZUPPPPP!!!!
No Marco Belttami on board :(
Been too long
So proud Mexican Melissa Barrera is in this movie leading the younger cast.
Stu is back baby
No they didn't
🤩🤩🤩🤩
They really use smart home features in a horror movie now. What a time to be alive.
Is this remake of SCARY MOVIE?
WAZZZZAAAAA
https://youtube.com/channel/UC8qYKb4qmMuvV1qTIWJavoA
Why not scream 5? And why until Jan.
Do you like scary movies Sidney?
What is the deal with movie sequels having the same name as the first movie? It only makes things confusing for later generations who want to get into the franchise.
LETS GO
😮😮😮😮
Yes 😍😍😍
Awesome! I was waiting for a new comedy movie. Can't wait.
Lo mejor
OUTSTANDING
Stop just stop making them.
Courteney Cox❤️
Love the trailer. Hate the scenes shown. Don’t overwatch this trailer or pick it apart. You will spoil the killers
Wow that looks good
Waiting for final destination 6 trailer
Perfect
Although I only watched the first one,I’m very excited about this one
Is that the lost in space chick?
https://youtu.be/M28LqRZQ-dg  JOE/HUNTER BIDEN
GhostFace is coming for SCARES this time and I’m here for it! 😱 hoping this will be even more of a bloodbath than the 4th film!
"He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?" Romans 8:32 Jesus Christ died on the cross for us all my friends, he is our Lord and Savior, and there is no salvation without him. Please, confess him as your Lord and Savior now! Believe in his death and resurrection on the cross, and that he died for your sins. Jesus is returning soon, REPENT, and believe. God Bless you all
Since there are no Dewey/Gale scenes in the trailer I’m willing to bet he’s killed right before Sydney shows up to team up with Gale
The fact that so many people have already seen this trailer since it's been uploaded tells me that in the very least more people will turn up for this movie then they did for Scream 4, which ended up having a better time on DVD/Blu-ray. Bless ya'll. This has been a very difficult few years, especially. Let's go watch our new favorite scary movie! <3
Looking forward to it as I loved the originals, but I am not sure that they will be anywhere near as good. I hope I am wrong though! The original first was great.
Why do I feel like they’re bringing back classics to show to the generation which I am happy to see later through the lines
Whether Jenna Ortega’s character will survive during the opening (the person on a wheel chair is definitely her!) Making her the new Sidney with a new legacy or we’ll having a plot twist where she’s actually the killer. Let’s see.
Nice work my Friend,I advise Everyone to forget about predictions and start making a good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses.The market is and always will be unstable and you can't tell if it's going bearish or bullish. While myself and others are trading without fear of making a loss others are being patient for the price to skyrocket. It all depends on the pattern you follow.I was able to make 7BTC in just July from implementing trades with tips and info from expert. Joel David Jason.
I'm so glad Sydney seems like she has a main role. I was afraid they'd either kill her off right away for a shock, or even worse she would be the killer. Which could still be possible but I hope not
Waaassssuuuppppppppp!!!!!!
Anyone else heard instead of “Hello Sidney?” as “Hello Cindddyy?”
Hello Sydney 👻💀
am sooooooo happy to see this
Looks so good!!!
https://youtu.be/bR3sJZdKkM0
They casted Monica galleries to clean up the mess killer made.
anyone else see this mask and just cant take it seriously anymore
Modern ghosts knows programming,he hacked all doors and windows
This loooks like a 5. 7 ratin at best
This at first was very cringe
BLONDIE DYLAN 😭😍😍
#2 ON TRENDING BABY LESGOOO
i love the use of the defunct landline, as well as the app-connected home security!! awesome modern take.
The first 2 movies were the best, 3rd one was good too, 4th was meh, I hope this one ranks among the best.

Dewey: Something about this one feels different  And we get a glimpse of Gale screaming with ambulance in the background. I don't think Dewey is looking so good guys.
JUST IN TIME FOR HOLLOWEEN.  THIS HOLDIAY IS 2ND BEHIND XMAS WITH CELEBRATION OF THIS HOLIDAY. IT IS VERY EVIL, SATANIC PRACTICES. INCLUDING HUMAN SACRIFICES. CHILDREN PREFERABLY FOR THEIR PURITY. REPENT OF THIS PRACTICE AND TURN TO JESUS CHRIST WITH ALL YOUR HEART.
It would be so meta if this movie wasn't meta  about scary movies at all.
Хочу посмотреть!!!! 👍👍🍋🍋
Hollywood is hell bent on destroying our culture.  Please just leave the 90's alone.  It's all we have left.
"He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?" Romans 8:32 Jesus Christ died on the cross for us all my friends, he is our Lord and Savior, and there is no salvation without him. Please, confess him as your Lord and Savior now! Believe in his death and resurrection on the cross, and that he died for your sins. Jesus is returning soon, REPENT, and believe. God Bless you all
I thought this was for cold war nvm
Who else is excited for this?
i have a feeling this is going to be the best one out of the entire franchise..
Anybody else notice that Stu's house is being shown throughout this trailer? 🥳
This seems highly unnecessary
Sydney lookin hagly
Is the killer a black lesbian now?
is this the new saw/final destination franchise..
I remember the impact part 1 had. I thought they should've stopped after part 2 but here we are at the 5th installment. Hope they don't do the first 2 a disservice
I hope Matthew Makes a Cameo some how like he lived through the tv and is alive
Same old boring story
Yes finally!!!
Just that shot of Dewey's bullets bouncing on the ground has me excited. He finally gets to be a badass.  This is honestly a great time for a new Scream movie. In taking a realistic approach to the trauma these kinds of events leave behind, it's better prepared for modern focus on surviving such horrors. Sidney remains an icon.
Should’ve been released on Halloween 🎃
yesssssssssss
This looks more like an action movie than a horror movie.
bro this is what I was getting ads for
THIS IS WHY IT PAYS TO BE BROKE!! I ain't getting no hackable lock system damn it!!😆🤣
So they kill Jenna Ortega in first 10 mins of the movie? Lame
Kirby is definitely the killer I have a Feeling
It was Billy, let's move on
Hello everyone 👋
It’s David’s son. Boom. Got it
Can't wait!!!
I don't think Courtney Cox can scream at all with that rubber face.
Glad this movie is 100% horror without comedy
That's why I don't bother with Smart Locks!!
Saw the first trilogy when I was about 14 15 years old, and for some reason, chicks back then look mature. For this new trilogy girls look like kids, like so underage little teenagers. How could a kid like this could even pull a knife?
Plot Twist, What IF Sidney is the killer or one of them in this one? The last two Scream movies they was family members, just a theory. 😳
This better be good, cause you know... 🤷🏽‍♂️ it’s 2021.
Does Hollywood have no originality anymore?
https://youtu.be/yJbR3SSbwkI
Absolutely biblical
I can't wait
The franchise is back, Scream 2.0. yesssss!!!
Funny to watch these movies in the 90’s when they would use big flip phones, and now they incorporated smartphones and technology lol
Neve Campbell is still hotter than 90% of the famous actresses today, hands down.
I don't think Courteney cox could have any more plastic surgery done. Holy crap does she look bad and probably spent a lotta money to do it lol
its not the same as the old scream......
What is this…    A comedy?
That’s what you get for using android
Ghostface vs Michael myers  round 1 fight
So bad but yet so good LOL, who the hell still uses a landline these days? Haha can't wait for this
Movie for idiots.
KIRBY is that you behind the mask ??
I am here from the new home alone trailer. Who else is here?
I'd watch this, it used to be scary, I'm excited for new one
It's finally here!! #6 ON TRENDING
Looks good.
I feel like I just watched the entire movie in 2 minutes & 19 seconds..
Pleasantly surprised by this. Glad that Sydney is back and ready to kick some ass.
i find it very unlikely that generation still has a landline.
What are they doing
SCREAM!
5.6 millons in a Day?  Wow Scream coming strong.
Well, that looks shockingly shit!
God ghostface is so iconic
It does not feel like a Scream movie. At least what used to be of it, when Craven was in charge. But the concept looks good. The new killer(s) attack people related to the killers, not the victims. So it has an interesting way of turning tables, while reflecting on the dangers of the « woke » movement. So I’m down for this. But knowing that, is the killer’s identity this important to the story?…
เหมือนพรมลิขิต หนึ่งในหนังเรื่องโปรดเลย
I could be wrong but I think it could be Stu that would be epic looked on Mathew Lillard’s wiki and also seen in scream 4 as well
I'll be seeing Halloween Kills this weekend my theater isn't doing the vaccine card thing.. I'll enjoy it because by the time this movie is out you won't be able to do anything go anywhere without it.
l like scary movies, which means I am excited as f*ck  to see this
Diversity, equality, inclusion box checked for trailer. Looks like garbage but at least we have DEI . 😁
Sidney bout to Sarah Connor'd this Ghostface to oblivion
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jWbp8DlPm3M ❤️❤️❤️❤️
but why call it this - that is confusing , like did you see Scream - what one? ...
FANTASTIC 🔥 THANKS ❤️
Sidney is boss ❤️
I keep watching the trailer on repeat as if something different is going to happen the 20th time LOL 😂
my dumb self would be like “ayo nice costume” as he’s stabbing me
Wish it was this October
5.5 millons in a Day?  Wow Scream coming strong.
Just don't let the killer be 5'6 or shorter and I'll be happy
After 25 long years, ghostface finally knows how to send text messages. We are ready.
I can't be the only, that instantly in their head, smells that cheap mass produced plastic mask we wore in the 90s when they see Ghostface.
Who still has landlines though?
No blondes in the reboot because we always die first 💁🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
Whether Jenna Ortega’s character will survive during the opening (the person on a wheel chair is definitely her!) Making her the new Sidney with a new legacy or we’ll having a plot twist where she’s actually the killer. Let’s see.
https://youtu.be/ZYjnpdd3Ii4
Panic Room already did it
Doofie is back!
Oh dear. What a waste of money
this is going to be a great comedy movie.  locks  the door phone lags unlocks the door
Hmmm.....
michael trailer, chucky trailer, ghostface trailer leatherface soon and still nothing from Jason :/
I can’t tell you how I know this. But dewey dies in this one 😞
Might be a spoiler alert but I only watched the trailer once and saw this:  Seeing Dewey fight him off and Gail screaming with Syndney holding her back with a ambulance in the shot scares me!! Dewey forever!
Looks like a very run of the mill generic horror remake, yawn.
Yes yes yes, but I can’t believe that I just now discovered this trailer. The villain behind the mask is anyone’s guess.  Scream 5 coming out in 3 months, gives me something to look forward to.
WAZZAAAAAAA
You should put "Your number's up", by Ice Nine Kills, as the main theme of this movie!
Holy shit thats -lamplighter- Hughie
Ghostface ( scary movie 1 ) : WHATS UP!!!! 📞😜😜😜😜😜
https://youtube.com/shorts/j8WfbJCyzPw?feature=share🤡
Dewy ❤️❤️❤️
This looks like recycled trash
For some reason I thought it was the trailer for Scary Movie 6
The call of duty skin???😳😳
If you kill Sidney, like Terminator did with John, I'll give you 1/10 on IMDb 😊
IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS OMGOMGOMG AND IT COMES OUT ON THE MONTH OF MY BIRTHDAY
JUST came from the Home Sweet Home Alone trailer, this is how you do it Disney, pay attention!
It’s weird that it not release on Halloween but instead release on January
Trash
Wow, this looks awesome. Looks like they even changed Dewey to make him a more serious character rather than the bumbling idiot.
Finally a new Scream Movie!!
the link is dewey of course
Looks awful
WHY?
When it comes out in your birthday 🙄😏
Looking forward to this
YES! looks fucking AWESOME.
Every movie idea under the sun has already been done I guess, time to has out the classics
My Question Is When They Are Gunna Release On DVD Blu Ray 4K?
New Halloween new scream new chucky jus need a new 1 for the hockey guy 😌
Not sure why she still has a landline...but I’ll check it out
“Would you like to play a game, tara?” Now instead of locking her doors straight after hearing that…she opens the door to get slashed
Nice
Ghostface I am respect and say WAZAAAAAAAP🤪
anyone seen Patrick Jane ??
SCARY MOVIE 🤣👌🏽
wazuaaaappp!!!
Nothing like beating a dead horse. Scream has turned into Halloween. Churning out unnecessary sequel after unnecessary sequel.
Scary movie has totally ruined Scream for me, I can't take any of this serious
I hope dewey is a badass this time
Taşak geçilecek yeni film bulundu. Heyecanlı mıyım... Evet
This looks incredible. Dark, serious, terrifying. I’m ready to be scared again.
LETS GOOOO
wazzzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
"What's your favorite scary movie?"  Was what I was expecting lol and instead I thought of SAW when I heard "Would you like to play a game?"
RAMBO KNIFE!!!
hopefully the new characters have enough personality, it's what made the first one a classic..
https://youtu.be/f5_wn8mexmM
Err... hey guys, you made this film already.
The high school kids make it look so fucking boring!
I can't wait for this!
yyyyyyeeaahhh
Scream (1996) #Scream Scream 2 (1997) #Scream2 Scream 3 (2000) #Scream3 Scream 4 (2011) #Scream4 Scream 5 (2022) #Scream5  #ScreamMovie
Doors Unlocked All doors locked Doors Unlocked ..... 🔪
When Sidney says “I’ve been through this” it sounds a lot like Caterina Scorsone and Neve plays one of her sisters on Grey’s
Вот это реально крутая новость а не этот sraniy ремейк "один дома"!
GHOSTFACE FINALLY RETURNS AFTER 10 YEARS! IM SO HYPED. LETS GO!
☹️
Spoiler alert, the killer is Cindy Crawford.
Ugh.....yuck.
Wow...another one 🙄...way to be original.
Lame.
Yesssss!!!
I rlly want Dewy to be the killer or to always be involved somehow
I think stu is still alive
I was waiting for this after fear street reminded me of ghost face again.
The movie would be perfect for halloween, why is coming until january???
https://youtu.be/tz2DEfsndkg
I hope we see Gail newsgirl in this one also :)
the man : would you like to play a game Tera ? me : sssssquid game ???
Really hope we don't get 'dark' Sidney.
VERY nice move holding back the jokes.
The Best Horror MOVIE ever ! 😱😈🔪
And than Americans do this for real 8n their schools thank to Hollywood hell
So we get a shitty home alone remake and then we get and awesome scream  trailer... Thanks paramount pictures lol f off Disney plus lol

JANUARY RELEASE DATE. Yeah that tells me all I need to know about this upcoming train wreck
This movie gonna make everyone with a smart home or are planning to upgrade their homes with smart things be paranoid or have second thoughts 😹😹😹😹
Broke Pls Send Money to: Mark Edwards, Flat 7, Preston Court, Sanford Lane, Wareham, Dorset, BH20 4DX, UK. Please Share address everywhere 🙏🏻
I can’t take the costume serious. Seems like it should’ve stayed in the 90s.
1:56 I could be wrong, but is that Stu’s house from the first film?
I miss Jamie Kennedy as the rules guy
Cindyyyy, this beach is messing up my floor
There's something about the way they're shooting Ghostface in this movie makes him look better than ever. The white mask really pops and the robe looks super flowy and black. Love this franchise
I like this movie.
I hope they don’t make this sequel a Politically Correct snooze fest like they did to the recent  “Wrong Turn” sequel.
One can only imagine how bad they wanted to release this around Halloween time.
Dude got passed the security that's normal in this day and age
Claimed it: the killer is a woman.

Sorry Craven 'cause we're kind of screwed here.

Looks like Sidney will be chased around Stu’s old house again! It looks really cool that they are going back to that location
"Would you like to play a game?"
This just makes me feel sad and old...
Hell yeah I love scream I can’t wait
From the same guys who did Ready or Not.......  Could be somethin'.
my 2 favorite horror series of all times getting New Entries over the next few months (Halloween & Scream) its a good time for horror fans
I'll be waiting.
https://youtu.be/Ja_cmxmreKM experience pure 8d
21st century horror. Scream has always incorporated technology without it being distracting. Literally scared.
Damn. They look old af
Oh she's BACK better than ever !!
Quit bringing it back - Would you kill it already!?
ENDLESS TRASH
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
again with sidney this it became tedious
Why not release this, you know, this month lmfao
5.2 million views in less than 24 hours. Hope this movie gets the credit it deserves❗️❗️ 🔪🩸
SPOILERS: THATS WHY JUDY LOOKS DISTRAUGHT AND RUSHING IS BC GHOSTFACE SENT HER A VID OF HER SON (DYLAN MINNETTE) WES ON THE SHOWER AND THREATENING HER THAT HE WILL KILL HIM SO SHE RUSHED ONLY TO ARRIVE TO SEE DYLAN DEAD. THEN SHE WILL BE KILLED SHORTLY AFTER OUTSIDE THEIR HOUSE(NEAR THE FLAG. U CAN SEE CLEARLY ON THE TRAILER) THATS HER
ALSO THE KILLERS ARE THREE THIS TIME: MIKEY MADDISON, JACK QUAID AND SONIA AMMAR
SURVIVORS: SIDNEY AND TARA/ ALSO LIV (THE THIRD KILLER)
DEATH ORDER: LOOK ON THE IMDB THESE NAMES IF U ARE UNSURE VINCE- MINDY- WES- JUDY- CHAD- DEWEY- AMBER- GALE- SAMANTHA- RICHIE  SURVIVORS: SIDNEY AND TARA/ ALSO LIV (THE THIRD KILLER)
I’m glad they kept the guy who did the ghostface voice instead of changing it
So now the scream dude is like a mythical creature?
"Don't disturb me when I'm cleaning my room."
Take my strong hand
I dont know the older i get the less i like seeing people getting murdered. Probably not watching this.
Damn Dewey's death is going to crush me. He's my comfort character.
The Dead by Daylight trailers are getting better and better.
This should of dropped in October for Halloween 🎃
This looks great but the lock scene at the beginning seems ridiculous in the film but scary in real life. Thank God we don't have automated locks.
I scream, you scream, we all scream. It's the same same same same story again and again and again. You halfwits. And that's a compliment. No wonder the world is getting so stupid.
He’s back!!!! Let’s goooo
I hate everyone involved in this remake. Anyone seeing this next year is to blame for the lack of decent films being released.
Finally of all these stabbing years  🔪🔪🔪🖍🖍🖍🖍
Based on the title, I hope this movie learns from Halloween and disregards everything after the original film so you see it as a continuation of the original. I just wanna see Randy again.
I’m so mad that Jenna is the first kill😭
https://youtu.be/bR3sJZdKkM0
I thought they were just releasing the old one on the big screen again, i didnt know it was a whole new movie. 😳
GHOSTFACE IS BACK !!! Yassssssssssssssssss
Wasnt sydneys neice the killer of scream 4?
Get ready to be afraid.....again.....again.
What!!!,No way!!!!l he's back😬.I CAN NOT WAITTT!!!!!
Never have been I expected to be this excited to see Sidney Prescott and my favorite movies ever again! 🤍
Cult classic movie. As a millennial it brings back so many memories and Halloween as a kid. The scream masks with the blood pumper. Man time flies just a little too quick from watching the original scream at the drive in theater through the radio. I hope you all enjoy your time here and wish you all good health. Happy Halloween 2021 :)
Meh. Underwhelming. Here’s an idea: have the new killers mimic the most recent horror movies “you will die in 7 days” etc. place a red balloon somewhere. Keep it meta.
It's not over
Whazzzzaaaaaaaap Hi CINDY.
Finally!!!! My favorite movie of all time so excited!!!! #ScreamBack!!
https://youtu.be/dRrzAGuwjV8
https://youtu.be/dRrzAGuwjV8
Can we get another Scary Movie?😆
I REALLY can’t wait for the SNL skits already. Lock. Unlock. Lock. Unlock. Pete Davidson: SUP
i was already excited then i remembered dylan minnette is in this
The StoneBridge Mix is fire https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAZDCkFECuQ Mama India [Reloaded] (StoneBridge Mix)
Selena Gomez would be good for that..
I just feel scared lol can't wait.
Yahhhhhhh Sydney Back
Watch ghostface be Matthew lillard 🤯
It reminds me of Scary Movie 😂😂😂😭
I thought the title is going to be 5CREAM
we got Halloween kills and this!! Let’s gooo🔥🔥🔥
This looks awesome
If you stiffen, sweat, and watch with bated breath, that's horror. If you SCREAM, that's FUN ❤️
An Ode to how “Internet Of Things”  will kill you.
Nowplaying
How the fuck are you supposed to be scared of him, his face is a god damn joke costume by now xD
Unpopular opinion but I think Sydney overstayed her welcome in the last movie already. The series won't grow if she's always there to save some teens and survives each and every killing spree, becoming something like the Ellen Ripley or John McClane of Scream. As much as I love the series, Sydney being front and center and always surviving is getting a bit stale. I hope they dare letting her go this time.
OMG IS THAT THE YOU S2 GIRL? DID JOE DO THISSS
I'm freaking excited! After 10 years ghostface is back!!!
I dont Even know this Movie..I just Came here coz of #aespa MV SAVAGE . Visit advertiser
Before I press play I want to make a prediction... Half of the cast is now black, and they made at least one of them gay.....  Alright, my prediction might have been wrong. But it's 2021 so I felt like the odds were in my favor...
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
kkkkk verdade
The fact that all the main people from the original are in it !!!
Got a minute into this and had to stop. This is why avoid fucking trailers. 10 sec teaser would've been great, not a condensed version of the entire movie.
Gonna be better than Halloween
Its my strong hand
I feel like they ruined scream. Scream was a goofy self aware movie making fun of the horror genre, this looks nothing like that, it lost what made scream different/unique
These movies are nothing like they used to be.  It’s just dumb seeing someone in a regular Halloween costume 😕 Not scary at all now.
WAZAAAAAAAAA  oh wait, this is supposed to be a Scary Movie?
☝🏻
I wonder if Dewey and gale are divorced. It looks like he’s living in a trailer
Dewey's the killer
The killer is Courtney Cox
I just love ghost face. I don’t trust horror movies, especially ones in January. But as long as I get to see a lot of the killer I’ll take it.
Who is missing from the old cast that was still alive?
I like to think of Ghostface sitting on the front porch, texting away
CALL IT 5CREAM, YOU COWARDS!
Looks amazing!! If this does well and becomes a new trilogy, they can call them Scream For your Life, and Scream Forever. 💯
I've seen a short story on tiktok with a similar opening to this
where the quote "what your scary movie"
Somenthing about this Ghostface feels different, like more creepy and scary. I can't wait to see this movie!!!
Can you make a good scream movie without Wes Craven? Can you? Hmm
Neve Campbell hasn't aged at all.  Still very beautiful.
Damn, even Courtney Cox is back??
Fun fact the “hello Sidney” and “it’s an honour” are not ONE line , when you see the context of “it’s an honour” in the movie ! DAMN!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Plz don't kill off the originals that's  all I ask 🥲
Can't Wait
One thing I noticed was the quick shot of Gale looking distressed and being held back at a crime scene, makes me think this will be Dewey's last rodeo😥
The lock scene is pretty fun
📞wazzzzzzuuuuuuuppppp
I know it might not happen but I just have a short hope that Wallows might have a song at the end credit lmfai
Im so fucking hyped for the new one, always have been my favorite horror series,the  last scream that came out I was 9 now I’m 19 can’t wait for this one
Sure it looks decent, but my god how many movies/series did we have by now...
i wanna see jenna scream without the s
The new scary movie looks good!
Who cares about this all the returning cast look like they just don't care anymore and the new cast can't pretend to  care even a little bit
Its the guy from call of duty
Aw shit here we go again
Is the killer Jamie kennedy returning in a weird cameo
How more unoriginal can these movies get holy.
Dewey obviously dies in that hospital scene
I thought this ad was a joke when she ran to open the door, the fact she still had a house phone and that the doors kept unlocking.
Whenever I see that mask face ,the first thing comes to my mind is scarey movie 👻
ISSA NO FOR ME DWAG
I just watched the whole movie
All the best ones died in the first one, hard pass.
I hope they don’t mess this up …😉🎬🍿
It's too bad Courtney didn't age the way like Neve did. I thought it was another scream mask.
Courtney Cox starting to have her own ghostface
Lol hackerman
Can we get new ideas or no?
Scary movie 5000 looks great!
Why can't they just call it scream 5?  A movie sequel isn't cooler because it shares a title with the original.
Когда-то были красивые актрисы, а теперь мексиканки. Ау Америка хватит так лажать!
Sigh.
Okay i feel like Dewey's dying this time.
Sydney: How many times I must teach you this lesson Ghost Face?

*Ghostface:* _Who was the killer in "Friday the 13th"?_ *2022 Teenager:*  _I don't know, I don't play horror games. I usually play Overwatch. Give me a sec, Lemme check with Google..._
The problem is that they all have android phones
❤️💜❤️ From India TamilNadu
Murders in masks aren't cool anymore
Andy, Laurie and  Sidney the best survivors fights back from their return killers?   The only question is will win in the end?
Looks really good!  And I’m so happy #paramountpictures didn’t spoil anything too major plot twist wise. There is still hints at certain characters being attacked but we’ve seen in the past films of close calls from being stabbed and killed.  Can’t wait for January!
WES CRAVEN REVAMPED VERSON.DOPE.
wow thought this was a fan flim trailer
I feel like I've seen this before.
“And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.” ‭‭Luke‬ ‭17:26-30‬ ‭KJV‬
omfgggggggg besides the show this look interesting
I'm excited to see Hughie in this movie :)))
Oh my fucking god Yes!!!!
Worst shit ever
Enough with this
Looks a shit
Nothings more fun then seeing your childhood star get killed 🥲
I can’t wait to buy the Scream Bundle in Warzone!
HELLO SIDNEY!!
So happy we get another Scream 🍿  Now please give us another Friday the 13th
Smart locks seem like a terrible terrible idea
Ahh i was hoping Kirby somehow survived from the last one 😩.
Apa saya doang orang Indonesia yang nonton ini?
Thanks i just watched the whole movie 🍿
awesome, whats the chick with purple hairs @?
Aw shit here we go again
BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! 🤣
is this just another gabage movie where they have to chance to kill him multiple times but doesn't...
I’m only here because of Cold War and ghost face skin
Yesssssss
Whaasup🤣
Why was it named just "scream"?
SCREEEAAAAMMMMMM What a chiller of a thriller!
2:05
Usual plot twist : it's one of the characters we see in the trailer......thank you
Literally, my favorite thing about this trailer is that there isn’t some corny joke at the very end after the title.
January WTH it should be released in October it's perfect for October!
Ok but how would the ghost faces recreate the first kill in scream, no one knew how that happened
THIS👏🏼IS👏🏼EVERYTHING👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼!!! Also Neve drinks Vampire’s 🧛‍♀️ Blood (Like Keanu) Gorg!
So is he a human or a monster?
Generic bullshit.
Can’t wait!!!!! Scream is my favorite movie franchise!!! I’ve even met most of the OG cast!!!
Ever since Scary movie Scream just makes me lmao
Knows guy is at front door... doesnt immediatly run to the back
This preview made me smile 😁 One of my favorite thrillers of all time.  As soon as she got the text I was hoping it was another Scream movie 😁😁😁
OMGGGGGG THEY ARE BACK!! I Love this already! Must watch
WHY NOT RELEASE IT ON HALLOWEEN
Is older remakes becoming GOOD🤯😭👏👏👏
In the trailer, the doors unlocking and the doors locking in the house is a reference to the original, when Casey locked some doors but most of them were unlocked. She didn’t lock every lock until Ghostface called her blondie… fucking dope.
I still can't take these movies serious after watching scary movie 😂😂😂😂😂😂
So this means I can remake the Godfather, Saving Private Ryan and still be regarded as a film director???
What if the killer is someone from the first movie?
at 2:01 I think that's Gale Weathers crying over Dewey Riley's Death :( like if you agree.
Sidney: Are you ready? Gale: For this? NEVER!! Me………….. Well I Am!!!
Although I should be scared This is HYPE!!!! Cannot wait to see some actors get fake murdered
🙄
ok but all i wanna say is how they gonna come out with a horror movie in January LIKE BRO JUST RELEASE IT RIGHT NOWWW FOR HALLOWEEEN
Ah yes….white people making terrible decisions I can’t wait😍
Not even scary
cbsndfw sent me

Getting that 90’s Master P & Slick the Shocker - Scream vibe
Should of been a october release
Sooooo why isn't this called Scream 5??
The return of Doofy
WAAAAZZZZZZUUUUUUPPPPP!!!!!!
So, who else dressings up as ghost face 😏
It’s gonna be a scream!!!
Looks like Ghostface is a professional hacker now.
So old concept.
What's your favorite scary movie?
Cool to see this still going. I remember when that 1st one came out so this is cool like for real cool. So this is a family member of one of the other killers is that what they said? Stu, the obvious.
2021 and poeple still use landlines! 😂😱
"I'm Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun." Atta girl.
This looks way better than I was expecting.
Do you like to play a game? first i think this is a SAW movie LOL
your gun doesn't even protect you from the knife
should come out halloween night,not jan 2022.
LoL imagine if dewey is the mastermind of all the ghost face killers just like in the parodied version of scary movie 😁😆
The person with the knife sure does have a good reaction time
Who do u think the killer is?
This movie looking dumb af
NO SABEN CUÁNTO ESPERÉ!!! Creo que los que crecieron viendo esto, no saben la GRAN EMOCIÓN QUE ES!!!
It's not a scream movie until I see Ghostface get his shit kicked in. One of my favorite things about the original is how much Ghostface just eats shit while still managing to kill them.
great!
Jenny Ortega 😈
Yass😍
LETS GO
Thank you, Paramount Pictures!
I can’t wait to see this. Looks like they stayed true to the original.
Instagram live kills....
https://youtu.be/xlaTzvGRQbc
It was the janitor from the first Scream all along
Ghostface pops up.... the excitement!!!
Yes👍🏼
Hell yeah!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This movie was awesome as a kid lol man I hope it doesn’t disappoint
Ghostface: Hello Sidney! Sidney: Waazzuuuuup!! 😛😛😛 Ghostface: Waazzuuuuup!!! 😛😛😛
I like how they're using current technology to play into ghost faces attacks and making it feel like there is a ghost face in the current time and not in 1999.
I don't miss it for nothing, it looks great
Absolutely love it! Can't wait!  So if I understood that one line correctly, the new killer is going after people related to the original people? So are we to believe these people, besides the OG crew, are related to Stu and Billy?
I'm gonna miss the hilarious-ness...
been following this release since the day it was announced there would be Scream 5 10 years ago! So excited
😆Neve Campbell and David Arquette ANNND COURTENEY COX!!!
YASS!! Can never go wrong with another scream movie, very excited for this one.
I never thought I needed this but I guess I did
Hello Sidney!!! Who here was waiting for that?
Damn, this looks way better than I thought it would!
Is nightmare on elm street franchise dead?
Yes!!!!! I cannot wait!!! The scariest movie of my child hood!!!
Wouldn’t it be cool if the killer was the child of Randy and Karen from Scream 3? What a callback to the original film would be! I wouldn’t see that coming.
Sorry...but the part when she gets cut and she slams the door kinda made me laugh. Probably is better with sound.
Can't wait !!!!
West craven is rolling around in his grave
This is my generation! I went to blockbuster to rent this! GenZ will never know that experience!
I truly have not been this excited for a movie since Scream 4 in 2011
I LOVE THESE SERIES SO EXCITED
This trailer left me feeling a bit woozy here
kkkk é bem assim kkkk
hi wubz here
I'm gonna fucking SCREAM!!!  I LITERALLY GOT MOTHERFUCKING GOOSEBUMPS BITCH...
Scary movie ruined it and I can't help but laugh.
"My mommy & daddy are gonna be so mad at meeee" Stu
Hel-lo Sidney.....IT's an honor..."  As my Sherlock Holmes mind takes over...
I hope I am wrong so it is a surprise to me but I am guessing they're flipping the page. Since serial killer documentaries are popular now and on every streaming service. The killer is a serial killer fan and is a fan of Billy and Stu and all who tried to kill Sydney. If you noticed,  the killer didn't ask if she likes scary movies but if she wants to play a game.. (I could be wrong and it is just a nod to SAW) As a devout fan of killers, perhaps Billy and Stu in particular. He/she/they goes after Sydney. Using the Ghostface m/o to lure her out. Killing people they know locally. So they believe if they killed Sydney after all the times she has survived, they would have done what Billy, Stu, Mrs. Loomis, Mickey, Roman, Jill and Charlie couldn't thus making them infamous. Seven people tried and failed. So they would make the biggest headlines if they were to kill Sydney. Perhaps it is many killers in the form of some sort of dark web horror movie fan/serial killer cult. That OR Stu is alive? Which they would have to come up with some crafty writing to have him return.. That or it could be Randys sister.. Being his sister she too may be a horror fanatic turned crazy after losing her brother seeking revenge. But that would be stupid.
There better be a "Waazzuppp" in this one
I wonder if it'll be like the recent Star Wars films, where they Kill the OG characters.
Don’t bring a knife to a gun fight ❕
Eh yea I’ll see it.
probably as predictable as scream 2, 3 and 4.
0:32 Okay that was funny. She could have live if kept doing that over and over again.
Dude at the beginning he says "would you like to play a game?" SQUID GAME REFERNCE OMFG OMFG OMFG OMFG
Sidney's wearing wedding rings. She's married.
These movie will forever scare me
there’s a reason it’s coming out in January
Estoy triste:(
I see Courteney Cox, I smash the like button.
Casey: what do you want... Ghostface: to see what your insides look like! 😱🔪  always wanted this franchise to go to a darker more serious place with the visuals & tone. Looks like we might be getting that this go around 🤞
Jamie Kennedy better be on this one or I'll go captain stabby on SIdney.
Not another reboot of a iconic classic. This is why Hollywood is failing and it's getting worse and worse for them to keep doing this every time!
Love Scream movies!!
😎 that hard af smart af rap ✊🏿 https://youtu.be/ExkUS5eLLWE
This one is goin to be a screamer
"Hello Sidney, It's An Honor"   Gave me chills...
I think she is going to get killed
https://youtu.be/tgLaacnwXFQ VENOM 2 Post credit scene for those who want to watch the whole thing !!!!!!
I love how the whole trailer isn’t just full of jump cuts, we actually get to see a scene start to play out. That’s how trailers should be.
I think the follow up Scream movies forget the original Scream was also a comedy that took the piss out of horror tropes like rules and stuff.
Ghost face comin in with that Saw entry: “Would you like to play a game?” 💀
GHOSTFACE FINALLY RETURNS AFTER 10 YEARS! IM SO HYPED. LETS GO!
im down bad bro i been simping over ghostface for the longest
Nice
Is it just me or does anybody relate this is an exceptionally scary trailer, like really well made, made me SCREAM for real.
They keep messing up movies
Rich people problems. Nobody is locking and unlocking my one door, turning on and off my one lamp. Jokes on you, I didn't pay electricity this month. If you're  young and rich, I hope someone is haunting you.   *Cam Bertrand*
Girl... bye
Ok I don’t know about anyone else but I literally got teary eyed when he said “It’s an honor” because I was GEEKING so much…..this is going t he INSANEEEEE
Wes Craven must be proud, may he rest in peace
Never new a horror movie would revive the world
I need matthew lillard to be scream.
OMG Amazing
Gonna be another dumb movie
My theory: Sidney has gone insane, can't differentiate between reality and fiction anymore, so she goes on a killing rampage against all of these teens that are past killer's relatives, thinking they're the killers. In the process she ends up killing those nearest and dearest to her (Dewey) without even realizing she's doing it
Going back to the original house...dope. I can't wait for this!
Wow, this actually looks like a blast! Can't wait!
GhostFace is coming for SCARES this time and I’m here for it! 😱 hoping this will be even more of a bloodbath than the 4th film!
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LEEEEETTTTSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOO
It's stu
It is wild to see an IP that was treated horribly finally get some love.
Was able to see Scream 4 in theaters (opening night). Soooo f**king excited to see this one!!!!! Think I might by tickets for two showings back to back on opening day.
This looks like a parody hahaha
Oh my God, I can't wait to watch 🔥 happy Halloween 🔥
Looks stupid.
God, I can already tell the characters are gonna make dumbass decisions. Like if they see him in their line of sight, someone will hesitate to shoot him or something.
There will  be a sequel to this movie . So we won't  know who the killer  is
The fact that so many people have already seen this trailer since it's been uploaded tells me that in the very least more people will turn up for this movie then they did for Scream 4, which ended up having a better time on DVD/Blu-ray. Bless ya'll. This has been a very difficult few years, especially. Let's go watch our new favorite scary movie! <3
coooooooooooool
Honestly i might actually watch this
i feel like this would be good if they used suspenseful background sounds instead of like action packet films sounds. it just makes it seem cheesy instead of classic

I'm excited for this!! ☺ I am leaning towards Stu as the killer. I guess we have yet to find out.
<--https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSkV2jxoRVVlyohxphQK-S9R
i’m read for it
I’m predicting Dylan is the killer in this movie
Oh boy, Ghostface is back on a killing spree, lets gooo!!!
WAZZZAAAAAPPPP!!
Wazzzaaaaappppppppp
Aaaaaaaaaaaahhh this is awesome!
This looks incredible. Dark, serious, terrifying. I’m ready to be scared again.
No wazzup? D:
Yes ! Gohst face is gonna use his knife a lot again  love scream movies this looks even better than Halloween kills sorry Jamie Lee Curtis!
Is it going to a good movie this time?
she gets stabbed and is perfectly fine lmao, can shut the door can use her phone lmao, this is gunna ruin the series, idiots trying to make a shit reboot
Wouldn't it be cool if Dewey turned weird and turned out to be a killer and Sidney kills him and herself in the process...
wack
Cool. Going to watch it.
Another Sequal?
https://youtu.be/l9jacVw1HFo
i hope it is revealed that stu is the killer becuase his death in the first one was just terrible
It's like what beyonce did to sia
How come they keep doing those movies ? It's the same stuff all over again but with smart phones
I bet it’s the kid with blonde hair.
What is this 1998? Who has landlines anymore? Plus I just seen DEWEY!!!!!! 😱😱😱
Trailer looks great but why did they not call it scream 5? it’s not a reboot it’s literally a continuation they said it themselves.
It's whatever. I'll wait for the home release. The one girl who's recognizable, Jenna Ortega, looks like she'll get killed off in the beginning. It feels like the old crew is gonna have a heavy role in this, which is cool for nostalgia but I'd like it if the kids were more the center of the story. But this is a trailer after all. And like I said, this is still a home release for me
This looks terrible.
The killer is Dylan Minnette 💯
Aw helll yea!!!
Why isn't it called Scream 5? It's a sequel to 4. Not a reboot like y'all think it is
Why?
Rule number one: stay a virgin!
“Hello Sidney..ITS AN HONOR”
Getting those early 2000 scary movie vibes. Love it
Weird thing to know is, they did filmed alot of fake scenes to throw off leakers...so maybe some or half of this trailer may be fake, or is in the final version of the movie!
Broooooooo my favorite slasher of all time is back😍
In the beginning that ain't no stuck in the middle, that's stuck with a killer
mama's are back!!!
Omg they brought back Sidney 😍😍😍
Espero stu aparezca, no se confirmó si murió en la primera, y seguramente el asesino es el hijo de dewe
Psyched for the latest Ron Lynch production! The guy’s a legend!
So from what I'm understanding with this plot they're using the same plot from the most recent Michael Myers movies where the Killer is trying to kill those that survived or did survive
I'm not going to lie I'm kind of tired of this plot under the idea that the Michael Myers movie is following the same plot the killer are trying to kill those that survive or we're related to those that did survive
Scream is BACK
YESSSSSSSSSS
I know who GhostFace is it’s “DOOFY’’
Toxic femininity or masculinity?
That's all FOLKS! 😆😆😆WHOLE MOVIE IN 3 MINUTES  TRAILER 🤣🤣🤣
Muito bom ❤❤❤
I thought it's scary movie lmao 🤣
It’s funny one so dumb
Dylan Minnette!?
W MOVIE
Where are the dogs at..... I'm just saying ....
Wheres "SpEcIal OffiCeR DooFy?"
LETS GOOO, I’m hyped to see this 🔥🔥 they brought the original gang back
Man the sequel was a parody of sequels, the 3rd was ending a franchise , the 4th was about franchise fatigue and reboots, wth is this besides a cash grab? Respecting wes my ass
I'm calling it right now. Dewey dies
Its obvious doofy behind it
IM SOO READY BRO. IM ALSO BEING GHOST FACE FOR HALLOWEEN TO
Sidney, Sarah conner and Laurie Strode are gonna have maniac killer chasing them forever.
scary movie just ruined this franchise for me.
*Hello Sidney... it's an honor*
Yep I’ve watched it for 15 times
My sound was used in the sound tracc 💙🙏🏾
Since there are no Dewey/Gale scenes in the trailer I’m willing to bet he’s killed right before Sydney shows up to team up with Gale
“I don’t play games unless we talkin fortnite”  -logic
Imagine Thinking Randy Meeks didn’t end up dying in scream 2, and all these year with the success Cindy Prescott been getting Randy meek felt it’s not fair because he’s also a survivor too but it’s always “Cindy” so now he wants to make his own movie 👀😈 yes I’m saying I think Randy Meeks is Gostface he always been so Fascinated about the character👀
Wow it's Been 10 Years Since the Scream Movies Hasn't came out but now It came
"Whats your favorite horror TV series that you have in your que"
Great another woke reboot
Girl in the opening is ugly. What is this!? Samantha is ok.
I can never take this franchise seriously after Scary Movie! 😂😂😂
MATTHEW 10:28  "And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear Him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."  (the Lord Jesus Christ speaking...)  — Proverbs 8:36b —  "All they that hate Me love death." – GOD  - Proverbs 14:1 -  The fool hath said in his heart,  "There is no God."
Amé esto.... ❤️🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪
HELLO CINDYYYY
Hospitals in real life: Overcrowded and bustling 24/7  Hospitals in horror movies: Completely dark and never a person in sight
The best franchise EVER! #SCREAM ❤
Damn they killed Dewey 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ the Courtney Cox screaming with the ambulance around in the clip is a dead give away. What other reason would she be doing that neve was in the clip with her
GHOSTFACE IS BACK BABY
Here's my prediction. The killer is Sidney!!! Attacks on the OG kills family. Sidney is getting revenge and trying to empty out the Gene pool
Imagine if Kirby Reed is the new GhostFace !!
Here we go again after 10 years goosebumps 😈😈😈
This looks stupid
That poor kid in the wheelchair. That's just unsportsmanlike.
Why do studios give too much away in trailers? Good Lord. You people need to take classes on how to make an effective, non-spoiler trailer.
What a great way to start new year
Looks like this time Ghostface isn't fuckin around first michael now this I can't wait
love to see it
Scream is easily the most fun horror franchise that exists. Lovable characters, humor, actual mystery, unforgettable opening scenes, all around good time. Can’t wait.  Scream 1 > Scream 2 > Scream 4 > Scream 3.
FUCK YEA BABY LETS GOOO
Get ready for Scream everyone!!
Where’s Kirby 🧐
yall thought i dident see the rainbow gay pride pin
I’ve seen this trailer so many times it has killed my motivation to see Halloween Kills
Not gonn lie this shit looks good lol
Copy cat of Strangers call
I feel like the name should be appropriate to the ending of the series, if this is the end of it. Like maybe Scream: Origins, or maybe Scream: the final cut
Lame
Damn the brother didn't even make it out of the trailer alive
I haven't even seen the other four films and I'm hyped
Dude payed respect to Sidney. Nice.
1:32 *black guy dies first*
🎈🎈🎈👌👌👌👌👌❤️❤️❤️
I wonder if I should watch the first Scream movie to watch this...  Probably yes because the "hello Sydney..." dialogue seems nostalgic... It was also funny to see sad Ghostface roaming around again.. 😆
I worked with Melissa Barrera several months ago on Anthony Ramo's "Say Less" music video shoot. She's great, wishing her continuing success and stoked for this movie!
Please don’t kill off Syd in this movie. She’s definitely another Jamie Lee Curtis.   The original who has survived all the Screams.
LETSSSSS """"""""inggg GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
kkkk é bem assim kkkk
Lessss go
Uh, I saw a bunch of school scenes... where are the guns? This is America ya?               If you got offended, wtf aren't we still talking about it? Last i heard, 22 school shootings in 2021 so far... and I rarely hear about them... like wtf....
Nooo jennaa 😭😩
Let’s gooo scream 5 is coming out next year in 2022
i am going to use a scream mask this october 31 you know what it is for this time i cant wait
You poor thing.
#StuLives
Oh man i can't fucking wait!! I'm hyped for this!!! Let's Goooo!!
Oh HELL YES! I am THERE!! I really hope they use “the song” in this one, really missed it in S4.📆😃👍👻
Finally! It’s here! AND ITS ALSO COMING OUT ON MY 13th BIRTHDAY!
When he said it’s an honor got the hair on my back standing up! Who else agrees with me!?
超楽しみ！！
Scream is back, after 10 years.
Fixed it. Sidney: "You ready?" Gale: "For this? FK yeah, I'm ready."
They should make a movie called yell where it’s just Karens fighting against each other
Fucking boring basically just like Halloween when they brought Jamey lee Curtis back. Probably the same dude as well.
Holy crap this looks good and the fact that they've got Stu's house in this movie makes it all the more interesting. Bring it on.  And welcome back to Woodsboro every one its going to be a SCREAM baby!!!
Scream is my fav psycho killer movie
THIS LOOKS AMAZING! LET'S GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Number 1 on trending
One of the best horror movies to exist ever in horror history.
well u cant kill sidney presscot
Show us the whole movie in 2 minutes why don't you. Damn, trailer makers these days are so lazy...
I think the pandemic have really thought people the important of multiple streams of income, unfortunately having a job doesn't mean security
Danggg they showed a little too much with this trailer but I'm excited for it nonetheless!!!!
They should do something shocking like killing one of the trio 🙄
The killer is one of them i swear!
So how about all those refrigerator trucks for all the bodies in the warzone hospitals so overwhelmed they had time to make tiktok dance videos while medical Navy ships sat empty
LETS GOOOOOO MY FAV SCARY MOVIE :D
Great trailer, for this movie be really good, my Five points would be: 1. Scarier Ghostface 2. Less Humor 3. Powerfull Chase scenes 4. Sydney can't die, but I would kill Gail or Dewey, there's gotta be something different this time. 5. Good Suspects.
My bet is a niece/nephew from her psycho brother, relatives of the psycho boyfriend from the first movie, just a random ass person who’s obsessed with Sidney Prescott’s saga and want to become famous. So members of YouTube, what’s your opinion of this revival/reboot of the Scream Saga.
If there are more than two killers this time?
WasssssssAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP
Wasaaaaaapppppp
I cant wait
Come on! Who has a motive at this point? Scream 4 was pushin it, who is it now? An apple bees server Sidney didn’t tip 20%?
Never gonna take a scream movie series until they remake it with a complete recast
Wasssssssssaaaaapppppppppp
Hmm the ghost face isn’t that scary anymore though… lol
Muito bom ❤❤❤
Do we really need this?
Coming out just in time for MLK Day, the spookiest of holidays.
This is helmed by Ready or Not directors so I expect a bloody good time.
This short made my day   https://youtube.com/shorts/WryG1sQmuO0?feature=share
Trailer did nothing for me, we don’t need a fifth film  Come to the Burrus classroom on why this movie will probably fail: 1. A January release 2. No Wes Craven 3. No familiar actresses and actors for the new characters 4. New characters 5. Maybe releasing on streaming 6. The baggage of the 4th entry so yeah and do I want it to fail NOPE
this dude will never be scary
I CAN’T WAIT !!!!
Omg is this is a dream come true or I’m still dreaming!!? It’s an honor … welcome back old g trio
After watched scary movie one...this character never looks terrified...🤣🤣🤣
this looks so bad, LOL
As a longtime fan of the film series, this trailer is bad. It seems to spoil a lot of the kills and scenarios and seems to have no emotional tone. Too bad.
HELLO SYDNEY! It’s an honor
Damn trailer it spoils everything
Neve Campbell aging like a fine wine
showed way too much
In theatres January 14??? They really messed up not releasing this before Halloween lol
Any bets on Jack Quaid’s character being Stu Macher’s younger brother/relative?
Wow coming back since 10 years and it’s on my birthday 🤠
WALUIGI FOR SMASH BROS
Let's Go Brandon Clap clap clapclapclap
okay the return to stu's house has me believing he or billy will be the killer. it would be much more thrilling then some random character we first meet in this movie.
Releasing this in January is not a good sign but i really hope is good. Also don't fucking kill Dewey.
Sydney is just fine😍😍😍😍
Looks like Scream is getting the Cobra Kai treatment
*"WHATS YOUR FAVORITE SCARY MOVIE?"*
Awesome trailer, I really hope the killers  aren’t Gale and Dewey. I will be so mad.
Oh yeahhh
Jenna Ortega to open the show heck yah, tho I wish she's part of the main cast, nonetheless Jenna is a great actress.
*WASSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP!?*
zzzzz
Man one of the originals is going to die I know it. I don’t want that. If I don’t watch it, it didn’t happen. But this looks kind of good…
*Billy Loomis, back from the dead*
00:03 same sound effect used in Halloween 2018 trailer when Laurie sees Michael in the room window
why the fuck can’t they just call it scream 5
Rule #1 — Sidney, Dewey and Gale all have to survive Rule #2 — A random 4th character has to survive, and then has to get killed in the sequel Rule #3 — There have to be two Ghostface killers
Way Better then that halloween kills bullsh😱😱
Hard to redo a classic….
Missed opportunity to call it “5CREAM”
Not as good as I wanted it to be.
Thanks for showing us at least four people who definitely die
No more Miramax dimension films :( looks promising though
Lets gooo!!! Absolutley insane trailer! Lovin the new mask (widened eyes look so badass) opening kill was totally rad to see the whole home security thing!
There’s something about everyone looking aged that makes this look really good. Like they’re veterans and know how to take care of shit when it comes back around!
"I'll be right back..." 🧟‍♂️
Please don't let the killer be someone stupid like the last two. The only ones that had a good motivation were Billy and his mom.
IT’S A SCREAMER
I like that he said “would you like to play a game” like from Saw
If the killer is not Matthew Lillard this movie will  be a let down
🩸
Why?
yea when they cant even bother to make the title of the movie differ from the original movie like here there just going to call it scream like the first one was so not you will have to look them up by year with the name lazy the plot sounds lazy he is going after the relatives of the original killers hmm i wonder what ever franchise did that but who knows maybe that was just a dream i do not have high hopes for this
:OOOOOOO EPIC
Remember kids, Sidney Prescott always has a gun.
you poor thing.
THIS is how you make a horror movie trailer.
I like this movie 😩❤️
Wow just like tho original scream but with modern technology looks lame
so pretty much Halloween plot old school meets new school to fight a common enemy while old school teaches new school tips and tricks
MOVIE OF THE YEAR COMING
We got it #1 on trending I’m so pumped for this! 🖤🔪☠️❤️
Plot twist: the killer is Doofy!
The killer is Doofy
fuck yes scream is scary again
Let's go Brandon!
I like how its always ordinary people against this mf. Call in one swat team and its game over
This and Halloween Kills better get an award 😭👌🏽
The fact they arent running around with auto shotties at this point is beyond stupid. 😂 like ffs its been 20 years.
I’m gonna need the music Peaky Blinders stole from the original in this one💪🏿
*Yeah scream is sort of my things*
I've been waiting sooooo long for this!!! Looks phenomenal!
Hughie? Ghostface has got to be Homelander lol
After a decade since the 4th, Ghostface is finally back & most of all welcome back Sidney, Gale Weathers, & Dewey 🎃I can’t wait to see Scream 5 👻January 14, 2022 🔥
이걸 또 우려먹네.. 너무 많이 삶아서 뼈도 없을 듯 한데...
They should of stopped at 3. The 4th one sucked and this one will suck too.
This is gonna rock https://youtu.be/5E_EGSzMAZs
I hope there’s some gory kills for dead meat
I don’t like scary movies, BUT-
- would you like to play a game, Tara? - sure.  Ends with them playing cards all night.
Hopefully this one coming out is better than Scream 4!! I watched it and I wasnt impressed at all!!
"Its an honor"... That just hits different when said in that way.
I dig this by all means Fuck yeah! SCREAM!
0:58, she always looks good
scary movie returns
Yess so good
"Slash, gash , put holes in yo **s "
coooooooooooool
Im sure they'll be another one if this does well, but revealing the real killer once and for all.
I'm a  90s baby and i cannot wait for this!
Time for an annual rewatch in preparation 🤗
First mistake of the trailer: NEVER SHOW THE FIRST KILL.
Dude, seeing Ghostface stomping and breaking a leg... My god, that's awesome!!! I don't recall Ghostface doing that in past films. He only slashed and stabbed his victims. This dude is brutal!
Thank god. I got tired of binge watching 1 2and 3
I’ve never been more excited for anything let this be the year of the best horror remakes ever 🔥
https://youtu.be/oSin2dhtVkE
I like the fact that the security system something that is meant to make you feel safe and secure is being used to fill her with fear and dread. I'm actually really excited for this.
Sydney's the killer. duh.
$5 says it’s the kid from 13 reasons why
I literally squealed when i saw Courtney cox THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD😌
Haven't watched a trailer this many times in one day for a very long time
Officer Duffey reporting for duty
note to self, never have your doors controlled by an app!
Oh my god this looks like it's gonna suck
For some reason, I actually wished the intro murder is a guy this time for a change.
It's obviously a sequel just call it scream 5.
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES
Damn have the women aged poorly
Trying to explain this movie to tiktok gen z! Sign…
Can't wait for Scary Movie 4
Is that same Scream house??
I can’t wait!!!!
😱😍.
As a horror fan and especially the Scream series, I would say the new Ghostface is…  ✨ “Possible” Spoiler Alert ✨  none other than WES HICKS (Dylan Minnette) himself. I mean, here me out. After watching this trailer, it seems pretty obvious, am I right?! If not, take another look and convince me he’s not the new Ghostface 🤣  First of all, a Tribute to our dear Wes Craven who directed the first 4 movies and may he Rest In Peace ❤️  I’m also betting that Wes is Deputy Judy Hicks’ son, little brother or nephew who is under her care. Not only is Dylan a well known actor (13 Reasons Why, etc.) but a “sudden” new character in the Scream series, who can definitely play the part of the new Ghostface. My guess is, Wes was “exposed” to these crimes at a young age, I mean, what cop doesn’t take files home and what child doesn’t give in to curiosity, especially when it comes to things they’re not suppose to do, let alone see with their own eyes. This is where his fascination grew, especially with each new kill by each new Ghostface and his obsession with Sidney Prescott 😍  That is my FINAL answer 😏  PS: If it’s not him, then maybe it could be an idea for a Scream 6, whatcha think? 🤣
The GF experience is back.
Lets Freaking Goooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We will fail everytime; it is in our nature 2 SIN. It is only through the  ****(BLOOD of JESUS CHRIST)**** that we can acquire complete Forgiveness. Accept Jesus as our Savior & ask 4 FORGIVENESS of your SINS, and accept that JESUS shed His BLOOD 2 atone for your Sins if u repent.  Then PRAISE the name of GOD. And then ask God for HELP with anything that you need help with.  It REALLY works.

Dewey walking down the hall reloading his revolver Liam Neeson style from Run All Night haha what a badass!!
old dwight
This could be Scream 25 and I'd still be hyped for it. I love everything ghostface-related. Bring it on!!
Where wu tang at?
OMG that's why you can't have android phones lol so many bugs that the doors was unlocking and locking by themselves LOL Apple security is everything LOLOL
Hoping this will be as good as the first one
Have they tried texting the cops "white woman in trouble"?
Here before the simps are
a educational video on how to kill people.
come for me Ghostface!! I dreamed about this day
If the three amigos survive a 5th damn film, I'm gonna be so pissed.
YESSSSSSSS FINALLY I AM EXCITED I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS NEXT YEAR 2022
Wes is so proud in heaven ❤😭
*If They Don’t Kill Bruhh Im Pullin Up* 💪🏽😈🔥
scream face got wifi wtf?
As a mega Scream fan, I agree with everything you say! I wrote a long article today about the new movie and how good all of the Scream movies and TV series are because the production crew and people behind the scenes are the same. I like that he’s keeping with the times with the new technology, and that Roger L. Jackson has returned! So far, each and every installment of the Scream franchise has been excellent, with Scream 4 being my second favorite. We’ll see how this ranks, but I seriously wish they would alter the title somewhat. This not being a remake, I have no idea how we are ever going to differentiate between this one and the original 1996 movie in conversation without there being a long-winded explanation. Hopefully the title will be altered somewhat before it opens.
A cowardly psychopath kills Women and defenseless people for no reason. and he wins in the end. Well this is not the kind of movie I like to watch.
“Hello Sidney, it’s an honour…” I GOT GOOSEBUMPS! So excited; this looks amazing; can’t wait to see!!! 😱😱😱
Anyone else stop at 1:22 and recognize Phin from Miles Morales?
Even though wes craven is dead is movies will live beyond his life and that his ghostface child came out of the shadow for another batch of kills
Okay okay they showed us the entire movie in the trailer
COPYCAT👻
Nobody cares about Scream....I know. Let's make a remake! This sounds like Ghostbusters' idea...just even dumber...yep, I know...I thought it was impossible too.
Y’all who you think is the weakest serial killer?
Does anyone know why Marco Beltrami didn't return to score this one?
I hope that David Arquette held out for some decent coin to return; it looks like he's going to be the one carrying this flick.
Liver alone, get it? Liver alone!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm feeling. A Lil woozy here
Gonna have to miss this one as well
Can't Hardly Wait.....Get it!? lol
😴
Yes!!!!
I didn’t know of a new scream movie. I’m so excited!
No one cared who I was until I put on the mask mwah haha
I don’t like this game…
If sydney dies in this one I WILL GIVE THIS SHOW SO MUCH HATE THAT THE SERIES WILL DIE!
I might watch it
So the Directors did Ready or Not (2019)...I'm down! Looks like a lot of fun (again) 😎👍
A mf like me would’ve had sprint burst and spine chill
I am soooo excited 😊 🔪
My favorite Halloween costume.
I'm hosting a bet session I'm betting 20 on Jack Quaid being associated with the Ghostface killings
Finally! A sequel that has every 90’s child approval!
I can't wait to see the movie 🎬
"It's showtime"
Gente Nueva, chaparrito. In favor of joey.
Fucking stupid.  The original was best
If you have your door locks connected to wifi you deserve whatever happens
This trailer is already inaccurate with modern times cuz it’s been forever since anyone has ever had a house phone
0:20 wAAaaAsSssSSauUuuUuPPppPp 🤪
Let's go 💀
La muerte, es uno de los eventos más grandes que jamás tendrá lugar en tu vida.   Afrontamos la muerte todos los días, consciente o inconscientemente de ella; la muerte acecha en cada rincón de nuestra vida. Como un león esperando atrapar a su presa, la muerte nos llega a todos en muchas formas y formas; aparentemente no hay nadie que pueda escapar de las fauces de la muerte.   ¿Pero sabías que hay una razón por la que morimos? La idea de la muerte con la que está familiarizado es solo la punta del iceberg. Mira, morimos porque hemos pecado contra Dios. La muerte según la Biblia es paga "porque la paga del pecado es muerte" (Romanos 6:23).Debido a que el hombre pecó contra Dios, vivimos en un mundo caído, antes era perfecto, pero ahora está en ruinas. Ahora que el pecado existe, Dios viene a juzgar al mundo con justicia. Está establecido que un hombre muera una vez y después de este juicio "(Hebreos 9:27). El estándar por el que te juzgará son los 10 mandamientos, la ley moral de Dios.   Él es tan serio acerca del pecado que le dio a cualquiera que pecara la sentencia de muerte, la Biblia dice que te la has ganado pecando contra Dios y cada vez que pecas, acumula su ira. "El alma que pecare, esa morirá". (Ezequiel 18: 4) El castigo son los fuegos eternos del Infierno "Donde habrá llanto y crujir de dientes" (Mateo 13:42)   Tendrás que enfrentarte a Dios el Día del Juicio.   ¿Irás al cielo o al infierno?   Aquí hay una prueba rápida:   1-No tendrás otros dioses delante de mí. 2-No harás ídolos. 3-No tomarás el nombre del Señor tu Dios en vano, porque el Señor no dará por inocente al que tome su nombre en vano. 4-Recuerda el día de reposo. 5-Honra a tu padre y a tu madre. 6-No matarás. 7-No cometerás adulterio. 8-No robarás. 9-No mentirás. 10-No codiciarás.   ¿Alguna vez has dicho una mentira? robado algo? usó el nombre de Dios en vano? ¿Alguna vez has mirado a alguien con lujuria? Él ve la lujuria como adulterio, “Cualquiera que mira a una mujer con codicia, ya adulteró con ella en su corazón” (Mateo 5:28). ¿Alguna vez has odiado a alguien? él ve el odio como un asesinato, "Cualquiera que odie a otro hermano o hermana es un homicida" (1 Juan 3:15)   Santiago 2:10 dice, "la persona que guarda todas las leyes excepto una es tan culpable como una persona que ha quebrantado todas las leyes de Dios".   No confíe en su propia bondad o buenas obras para salvarlo. Eso es como sobornar a Dios para que te deje entrar al cielo; Ni una iglesia, pastor, sacerdote o religión alguna. Ninguno de nosotros es bueno en absoluto, incluso los asesinos, violadores, incluso Hilter se llamarán buenos y tratarán de justificarse por sus buenas obras. Pero la biblia dice:   • "Pero todos somos como cosa inmunda, y todas nuestras justicias son como trapos de inmundicia; nos marchitamos como una hoja, y nuestras iniquidades, como el viento nos llevaron". (Isaías 64: 6)   La definición de Dios del bien es moralmente excelente y, por lo tanto, exige perfecciones absolutas. Nadie puede igualar sus estándares. Por eso Jesús dijo: • "Nadie es bueno sino solo Dios". (Lucas 18:19)   Si ha hecho alguna de esas cosas, Dios lo ve como culpable de quebrantar su ley y la Biblia advierte que los culpables terminarán en el infierno. ¿Serás culpable el día del juicio final?   "Porque la paga del pecado es muerte, pero la dádiva de Dios es vida eterna en Cristo Jesús Señor nuestro". (Romanos 6:23)   Dios envió a su Hijo a sufrir y morir en la cruz. Jesús tomó el castigo sobre sí mismo y derrotó a la muerte en la cruz; no por tu Bien sino porque Dios es rico en misericordia.  "Porque tanto amó Dios al mundo que dio a su Hijo unigénito, el que en él cree no se pierda, sino que tenga vida eterna". (Juan 3:16)  Jesús resucitó de entre los muertos y venció a la muerte. Arrepiéntete (vuélvete del pecado) hoy y confía en Jesús y Dios te concederá vida eterna; también nacerás de nuevo.  Él te dará un corazón nuevo que desea la justicia, lo que es justo y un corazón que amará a Dios.  por eso Jesús dijo: "De cierto, de cierto os digo, que el que no nazca de nuevo, no puede ver el reino de Dios". (Juan 3: 3)  Luego, lea la Biblia y obedezca lo que lee.  ☆ ¿Cuándo vas a estar bien con Dios?  "Hoy, si escuchan su voz, no endurezcan su corazón como lo hicieron en la rebelión" (Hebreos 3:15) "Ahora es el tiempo aceptable, he aquí ahora el día de salvación". (2 Corintios 6: 2)   • "Tampoco hay salvación en ningún otro, porque no hay otro nombre bajo el cielo dado a los hombres en el que podamos ser salvos". (Hechos 4:12)   Es tu elección. Los dejo con esto: "¿De qué le aprovechará al hombre si gana el mundo entero y pierde su alma?" (Marcos 8:36).   Si te estás tomando esto en serio, ¿te gustaría una oración? Esta oración no es garantía de que serás salvo, eso es entre tú y Dios. Sin embargo, me gustaría que este fuera un buen comienzo para su viaje.  "Padre, te agradezco por el corazón abierto de esta persona y le pido que se arrepienta y confíe solo en Jesucristo. También te pido que guíes sus pasos en su camino para que pasen de la muerte a la vida. En el nombre de Jesús Amén.

Death, it's one of the biggest events that will ever take place in your life. We face death everyday, conscious or unconsciously of it; death lurks around every corner of our life. Like a lion waiting to catch its prey, death comes for us all in many shapes and forms; seemingly there is no one who can escape from the jaws of death.  But did you know there is a reason why we die? The idea of death you're familiar with is only the tip of the iceberg. See we die because we've sinned against God. Death according to the bible is wages " for the wages of sin is death " (Romans 6:23).  Because man sinned against God, we live in a fallen world, it was once perfect, but now in ruins. Now that sin exists, God is coming to judge the world In righteousness. "It's appointed a man once to die and after this judgement" (Hebrews 9:27) The standard he'll judge you by is the 10 commandments, God's moral law.  He's so serious about sin that he gives anyone who sins the death sentence, the bible says you've earned it through sinning against God and God pays you in death. Each time you sin you build up his wrath. “The soul who sins shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4) The punishment is the eternal fires of Hell " Where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 13:42)  You will have to face God on Judgement Day.   Will you go to Heaven or Hell?  Here’s a quick test:   1.You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)   2.You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you're more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)   3.You shall not take God's name in vain. (Have you ever used God's holy Name as a cuss word?)   4.Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.   5.Honor your father and mother.   6. You shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder, 1 John 3:15).   7. You shall not commit adultery. ("Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart" Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).   8. You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).   9. You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).   10. You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealousy desired what belongs to others?)   James 2:10 says, “the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God’s laws.”    The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts.   If you have done any of those things, God sees you as guilty of breaking His law and the Bible warns that the guilty will end up in Hell. Will YOU be guilty on Judgement Day?    "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23)   God sent His Son to suffer and die on the cross. Jesus took the punishment upon Himself and defeated death on the cross; not because you're Good but because God is rich in mercy.   “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16)   Jesus rose from the dead and defeated death. Repent (turn from sin) today and trust in Jesus and God will grant you everlasting life.   Then, Read the Bible and obey what you read.   Pray something like this:   "Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). Today I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is 'The way, the truth, and the life.'" Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen."   When you find time please read this, it's Christian principles for growth:   https://www.livingwaters.com/save-yourself-some-pain/
I just can’t take this guy seriously after growing up with Scary Movie
Sydney is a goated survivor!
FINALLY! FINALLY! WE GET A TRAILER THIS LOOKS COOL AF! I THINK WES WOULD BE PROUD!!!
Just now getting into scary movies in theaters, so I'll check this one out🔥
Scream 5
This looks SICK! OMFG.
"Ugh I gotta stop drinking"
“I’m Sydney Prescott, of course I have a gun.” Best line from the most badass Scream Queen of all time.
Welcome back
Smart homes are a smart killers best friend
Same shit just with token minorities. Nothing to see here.
Old scream movie is funny and good New scream there's no funny
Aww shit here we go again.
What if Ghostface was a familiar face in the past? That would be a plot twist!
I'm so glad Sydney seems like she has a main role. I was afraid they'd either kill her off right away for a shock, or even worse she would be the killer. Which could still be possible but I hope not
Looks like a fun trip down memory lane.
The beginning is totally Stab 5 lol
The perfect trailer doesn't exi.......  oh wow. This thing is a beaut. Nostalgic intro throw back to the original movie with a modern technological twist, returning favourites and the tagline: It's Always Someone You Know teases numerous characters that we ALL know who could be behind the mask. Roll on January it's gonna be a Scream!
OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!! YESSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!
Hello Sydney it's an honor 🎖
They stop the killer by leaking old racist post they made on Twitter.
wheres the funny?
Wasssssssssssssuppppp
The attacks were on people related to the original killers. This is an interesting tie in to the franchise. And this looks like the best Scream movie since the first one. Can’t wait. I think Wes would be proud, if the movie is as good as the trailer was.
I just put the tip in made her scream just like she sidney
I see Anna Faris, I likes
Scream
This looks amazing and could possibly be my second favorite SCREAM film! 😍
Why can't they make a new name for remakes/ late sequels.
"Would you like to play a game?" isn't that Jigsaw? Are we crossing the horror streams?
I beg of you paramount, on behalf of all scream fans please don't fuck this up
can we talk about how dumb the title is? why not Scream V?
Surreal
Scream 5
3 killers Imo
I remember when this had 800 views… wow the good old days
10 years and Ghostface is back!!🖤🖤🔪
I bet Wes (Dylan Minnette) is one of the killers
I guess we bringing all the old horror movies back love horror movies
So, this isn't a remake, but actually scream 5, or not? Is this a way to introduce a whole new cast, and milk another 3 or 4 movies out of this?
Rulez!
Here we go again!!
What will they call the 6th movie if there is one? It would be stupid to call it Scream 2.
Can’t wait to watch this
Omg
Hello Sydney.
Comes out on my 22nd birthday so now got something to do
I’m looking forward to January now.
If the killer isn't the mother fucker with dyed blonde hair, I'd be surprised.
Let’s goooooo
Why do we keep doing this
I CAN'T EFFING WAIT
I feel like there has been so many Scream movies that I won't find this as a horror movie, i think it's gonna be a bit goofy tbh
OK, that use of Using technology to unlock the doors in a horror movie, brilliant idea!!! It looks good.
Please let Ghostface be Stu!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
should have been called 5CREAM
Why do I feel like they’re bringing back classics to show to the generation which I am happy to see later through the lines
Welcome back Ghostface! We have missed you!
“Hello Sidney, it’s an honor” OKAY FUCK
I’m listening…
We're in Scream 5 and Sidney Prescott is still not dead is insane.
It's Cotton Weary. And that's nit a prediction it's a spoiler 🤣😂
Please bring back Kirby. Im in love w her n thats the reason to bring her back. Super excited for this!
The absolute state of Hollywood...
Australia is very funny ! The South Pacific is a very vast sea area, competing with China for the South China Sea! Just an excuse for Australian politicians!
Love the scream movies
These young actors all feel so over-the-top with their expressions - like they all came straight from the Mickey Mouse Studio of Acting. I don't like it. Reminds me of that little shithead Waldo from the 90's Little Rascals movie. God I hate that kid.
One kick on the balls all it takes.
Yessssss!!! LFG!!!!  I was scared this was gon be a corny remake; instead, it's just a continuation of the story, which is what we all wanted!!!
Literally three months from now
Wazzzzaappp
“HELLO SIDNEY”  -so iconic 💯
Who thinks it's Hank Loomis!!!
This Ghostface seems a lot more brutal this go round.
Can't wait to go watch this at my local AMC hint hint 👀 8.01
Жду:)
Ghosty has returned fellas!!
👏Make👏Dewey👏Ghostface👏finally👏thats👏all👏I 👏need
That’s some good sh*t!!! ;)
These movies sucked
I AM SO HYPE
WE BACK BABY  LET'S GOOOO 🔥
glad we get it on the 13th here in australia
Wazzup!!
After all of these years. I believe this is the film where we will definitely lose one of the main three? Go check out my reaction I'll  BE  RIGHT  BACK!!!
Who the hell has a homephone. I know it fits but damn. Mustve been apart of the internet bundle
Question is... Is it a "he"? I bet it's a black trans woman.
I CANT WAIT!!!!! one of my favorite movies returns!
Why would she run to the door
The old cast look so old and wrinkle up
Scream and Hotel Transylvania 4 coming out on the same day? Damn, I guess Halloween in January really is a thing now.
I'm so old.
I can't take Scream seriously anymore after watchin Scary Movie
I never thought there would be another one now i am waiting fo a new Jason movie
Scream is back! RIP Wes Craven
they back! love horror movies
I have a gut feeling Sidney might survive this…again
There is a split second shot of Gale that I think might give away a major spoiler.
I’ll bet you that the killer is Stu 😩
When he says "HELLO SIDNEY" ICONIC AS FUCK
Bruh why would she open the door
Scary Movie flash back
Looks promising 🤩
BUAGHTT WAIT 💦 !!!! …..THERE’S MORE !!!!
Its probably the guy who plays hughie on the boys
My God, they look so OLD!!!!
What's your favorite scary movie
Ah yes, another classic revamped.... Where are the new and original ideas for movies
These new actresses are No Sharon Stone.🤲
HE’S BAAAAAAAAACK!!!
Welcome back ..
After 10 years he's finally back
So this is what happens when Micheal Myers was resurrected……    He called backup 📞🎃 —> 👻💀☠️
I hope this does not suck
wow I loved the door scene. I hope they don't kill OG cast like Star Wars did.
oh snap! i'm speechless here we go again
OMG YESSSSS
Is he gonna hook people
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS TRAILER IS PERFECTION!!! I HAVEN'T BEEN THIS EXCITED ABOUT LITERALLY ANYTHING IN SOOOOO LONG!! "Movies don't create psychos...movies make psychos more creative!" 😝😝😝

Haha landlines! Thats what really is gonna scare these kids!
I thought Americans have guns in their homes
What's you favorite Scary Movie?
We all go a little mad sometimes
Wow....nice way to ruin a classic
Pov: You’re waiting for James (Dead Meat) comment
The scariest thing about this trailer is that landline phone.
If you're here before a 10 M views give me a 👍
I love your content! Be safe everyone! 🙏🏽
Sidney Prescott, one of the most beautiful and baddest ladies of the 90s and she still fucking got it!!!
I’ve been waiting for this movie to come out since I was in high school 😀 now I’m a Dad with 2 kids
Wow very nice!
After all these years AAAAAAAAAAAA
Funny that this trailer and the Scream trailer came out at the same time and this has more views lol
I’m SCREAMing omg 😱
My favorite Peli Movie yes yes 💣🔪❤🔥😍🇦🇷
Finally was waiting for this..😆
Passing on the torch…This is amazing

Let go
good trailer
Killer is Dewey
3.2M views in 10 hours AND #1 on trending… IT’S A SCREAM BABY!!! So excited.
FINALLY... I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER SEE THIS AGAIN <3 <3
I just hope Dewey doesn't finally die, dude been stabbed so many times throughout the series
My money's on David Arquette
well now we know the opening kill
This is a much better trailer than the 'Home Sweet Home Alone' trailer 😌
How many years has it been
Who could be following in the footsteps of Jill and Charlie? They were the previous killers in the last film
<--https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSkV2jxoRVVlyohxphQK-S9R
Now we want Scary Movie too 👏👏
Yassssssss, i cannot wait!!!
sdfasdf sdfasdgsga sdfdsragasdfasdfadfasfsadcfs OH MY GOD
My prediction for killers are dewey and clay from 13 reasons why, what's everyone else's?
Trash
i cant take him seriously anymore after the parody of him smoking weed ''wazzzz upppp'' lmao
JUST CALL IT SCREAM 5 GODDAMMIT
Bruh, stop… 🤦‍♂️
What a waste
I'll be right back!!
Maybe the new Ghostface should start using guns since he's not immortal like the classic slashers like Michael or Jason. They can get away with using melee weapons.
Looks better than that resident evils shit
I'm very excited for this one!
Neve Campbell aged really well!
A horror movie in January?!?!  Sounds amazing!
Why couldn’t they get known actors, other than the original 3, who are these people??
They started the advertising early with the ghostface operator on warzone lol
"I've been through this....a lot."
Hermosa peli
mony mony mony$$$   MON EY$$$  Boring
I CANNOT WAIT, the amount of times I’ve binge watched all the other parts is insane 😍😂
"I'm Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun" Fuck yeah!
Yeah, you know I'm gonna be in the best seats in the theater for this (even if it sucks)!
No
Slice and dice
I'm absolutely excited for this New Scream movie 😁
i got a feeling this is going to be better than the past 3 screams...
I thought this was a app for locking your door or something when Saw the ad
Plot twist, Cindy, the years of torment and killings, has twisted her psyche to the point, she's been driven to madness. Her mind split, she has become Ghost face itself and coming face to face with Ghost Face is an illusion of her broken mind. That would be cool!
I am interested to see how Scream will adapt to the modern age of home security tech. When Scream 4 came out we had just started having IPhones. Excited for this!!!
GHOSTFACE IS BACK after 10 years SHE BACK 2
MY BODY IS READY
Would be great if Randy were still alive and he could give us social commentary on streaming and video rental stores going extinct
They forgot to add the comedy aspect to the trailer.
YESSS I CANNOT WAIT FOR SCREAM 5!!!❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finally! Can't wait! Gonna miss Kirby though TBH...
can't wait to never watch this repetitive piece of garbage!
Oh fuck I remember the 90s!
Dude can’t wait to watch this grew up watching scream & scream 3
Love how they brought back three originals. Im going to go see this and Halloween Kills
ehh it looks alright
Why didn't they call it "Screams" with the 5 from "Stab 5" as the S? Missed opportunity there. But still looking forward to this and Dylan Millette's one expression 😐
So, he's killing people related to Billy and Stu...But he also wants to kill Sidney. Veeeerrrryy intriguing.
Why do we keep making sequels with the exact same name of the original?
Okay nobody owns a home phone anymore I'm calling bullshit
I'm watching scream right now...and did I see Stews house
Surprise Sydney
Scream 5? "Who'd want to do that? Sequels suck."  Thank you, Randy Meeks rules.  For me, the franchise died with Randy. Scream 3 was ok since it was already planned as a trilogy after the first two. But, yeah, for me there shouldn't have been more after that. Unless, they're gonna pull a Halloween do over and exclude the events from the previous sequels. I mean, this isn't called "Scream 5" so it makes me think it could be possible.  Even still though, even though Randy was one of my favorite characters (along with Dewey and Sidney), I just felt like the series should've stopped at 3. I didn't like 4 and while this trailer is good, it makes me lose more interest. Idk why some of these horror movies have to keep things going. Even if these newer sequels do turn out to be do overs and replacing their original sequels.  Whatever, the other thing this, Randy's death was supposed to show that nobody was safe, not even the beloved characters, which did make sense. But 3 and 4 kept Sid, Dewey, and Gale alive. So, by the looks of it, Dewey could die in this one. Personally, I don't want him to, but the whole point of giving Randy's character a shocking death scene in S2 was to prove that anything can happen to anyone. So this time, one of them better go. As much as I don't want them to. Cause that's the whole point of this franchise: anyone can be a target. And.. "Everybody is a suspect!"
I'm confused..why is this happening?
Whazzzzzupppppp!
What’s your favorite scary movie?  Imma gut you like a fish!
The Halloween treatment
First things first, who the fuck has a land line in 2021 Secondly, just.... why? Scream 4 was already borderline unnecessary, this is just gross
Im excited to see it in januscary.👻
really
I'm OK with this one
Hype
Would You all like to play a game everyone 🔪
i saw the film early
I see mk11 dlc here
10 year anniversary of Scream 4 and we’re back at Stu’s house what the hell is gonna happen.
GHOSTFACE FINALLY RETURNS AFTER 10 YEARS! IM SO HYPED. LETS GO!
Halloween (2018) and Scream 3 decided to have a baby an it aint lookin pretty
Ready ? For this .. never  I think that sums up how a lot of us original from the beginning Scream fans feel  We are excited but anxious .. how can we truly be prepared for this new era ? Like most I doubted prospects of this franchise being able to continue without the master Wes Craven around but this trailer gave me chills it looks like it will deliver a lot of signature scream elements but also bring us some new fresh tricks and treats  Ghostface seems legit badass I'm here for it   Ready to keep screaming 😱🔪❤️
STOP REMAKING MOVIES! USE YOUR CREATIVITY AND DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT 🙄
#1 on trending DESERVEDDDDDDDDDDDD
yesssssssssssssssssss
This is my life, this is ALL I look forward to 😤
10.5 YEARS LATER AND WE ARE FINALLY GETTING THE TRAILER FOR THE NEXT MOVIE ‼️‼️🤯
Dewey!!!!!!!
I’m so happy we get another scream movie but they better not kill any of the og cast !
Lol who the fuck has house phones anymore come on
Ghostface is back, motherfuckers!
is it still scream 5
Play a game? you mean SAW?
I wonder if it will have any comedic elements
1# ON TREND Baby!!!  Yesss
We get to carry on and plan the sequel… 'cause let’s face it, baby, these days ya gotta have a sequel!
WAZUUUUP!😝
Looks fine I guess
The best movie in the world!!!!!!
1:03: best line!  I wish Elisha Cuthbert had been in this movie...
when Ghostface stepped on that ankle !!! ouch I could  feel it
January movies are the worst
This looks fire I’m so hyped! I love the scream movies can’t wait for the next!
WHY JANUARY! IDIOTS!
Again, another reason parents need to be teaching their daughters how to effectively use a firearm to defend themselves 😒
Dam Sid a grandma now
Bruh the childhood memories of being Scream on Halloween this looks dope
“Movies don’t create psychos. Movies make psychos more creative.”
Meh. Seen one, seen them all. Slashers are a dime a dozen. This one will need several twists to keep me interested.
Nothing says holiday season like a Scream movie. 🤣 This should've gotten a Halloween release.   Also do people still have landlines in this day and age?
If there's one thing i leared from this trailer. It's to not get locks that can unlock from your phone because Ghostface will just hack into your system and kill you 😂
Who y’all think is gonna be the killer on this scream movie  Stu or Jill or someone New that is from the past.  Comment what y’all think who it is.
Ghostface is the only one taking COVID seriously!!! Nobody is wearing a mask.
I wonder if the killer is Kirby
Ion even wanna watch it any more they done killed Jena already 😒😒
Wish Hollywood wasn't full of lazy fucks and would make something original.
January was an interesting choice.
I bet $1,000,000 that I don't even have that Dewey gets stabbed. Lol Actually should bet more lol 🔪
This is gonnna be so epic
Did yall see Stus house!?!?😳😳
Yeeeeeaaaaaahhhh OMG!!!!! OMG!!!!!!!
Her Ex-boyfriend, her ex-boyfriend's best friend,  her second ex-boyfriend's best friend, her first ex-boyfriend's mother, her half-brother, her cousin, and her cousin's lover were all serial killers.
WHAAAAAAZZZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP
James gonna have. A blast with this
HORROR YEAR UNLOCKED
The soundtrack sounds really good tbh.
absolute classic I cant wait for this to come out
the killer better not be another family member😫.
Instand like
Can’t wait!
Is it me or he looks like Joel. 🥺🥺🥺 if you know you know . RIP JOEL  #TLOU
0:24 But Why?! .... But Why open the door?
Berries and scream, berries and scream
welcome to the kill count
NOOO Not Jenna Ortega T~T
Halloween ends 2022 sorry scream!
"doors unlocked"  , "AHHHHHHHHH!!"
Not scream if you don't have the Wes Craven...RIP Wes
This movie series stopped being scary ever since Scary movie came out
Sadly the first time i met Ghost face was in Scary Movie! So i never took him so serious! Still can't!
what is with 90's remake in 2021
"'Cause let's face it, baby, these days, ya gotta have a sequel!"   RIP Stu, a lovable psychopath
I wish it came out this Month in October. 🎃
👎
So, is the killer Randy’s sister or Billy’s father?
#Non-Blonde}
why the fuck would they release this in January? come on...
It’s gonna be Stu, isn’t it?
Promising!
January needs to hurry tf up!🔥🔥🔥😍😍🔪💯
OH MY GOD YES ANOTHER SCREAM
#ForWes ❤
YES!!!! FINALLY!!!!
good
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4OveUZ8PVLQ
BEST 👏🏻 HORROR 👏🏻 FRANCHISE 👏🏻 EVER 👏🏻
This will definitely be forgotten quickly
Omg so good😍
"Something about this one just feels different." Yeah I doubt that.
Plot twist: the killer is Sidney
Im so happy Scream has always been one of my favorite slasher series! So excited!!!!
The trailer was well made but the younger people that were casted looks meh. The type of cast you see in a shitty Netflix teenage drama show
This one gonna hit different.  Happy it coming back scream🔪🔪👀👀👀👀👀👀👀
I love that they have Sidney return to Stu Macher's house.  I'm assuming one of the people live there....hence her line "...related to the original killers".
Gale better not die! Also plot twist, sydney is the killer (or even better, her and someone else from the older cast, or ALL of the older cast!!!) xD
Murdering teenagers is not something one considers when balancing the universe. But this does put a smile on my face!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Awesome
Omg So Much Memories 🥺Come Back, And Great To See The Original Cast Again✌Can't Wait To See It📺
HELL YA! GHOSTFACE IS BACK!
If Mason Gooding dies, then I don't care about this movie.
me and sophia mou cant wait for this!
Hey its the guy from call of duty!!!
I was waiting for him to say "wassaaaaaap" then I realized that was a parody..   😂😂😂😂😂
Scary movie returns 😂
🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
why not just call it SCREAM 5!!!!???? SCREAM is already a movie. I hate this new trend.
Is it it just me or does ghost faces voice sound different?
January? Uh oh......
so white jesus
Yesssss yes neve campbell ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
“I’ll be right back”
i hope he wins this time... he should bring a mori
This is epic! Such a great time to be a Horror fan!
I'm not going to theaters to see another Scream reboot in mid January. They should have just push to October 2022, and maybe I would have spent money on it. I might be in the minority, but I'm one of those people who only cares about Horror movies during the Halloween season, and could care less about it the rest of the year.
Can we get another series tho 😂😒
NO WAY THEY GOT JENNA ORTEGA TO BE IN THIS!!!
go to 1:54 that Kyle gallner dude looks dead af
I can’t wait . Ghost face the best slasher of all time🔪
looks like shit
The first impression was "meh" that's a copy of the original with new technologies but then i saw Courtney Cox, Neve Campbell and David Arquette, and now i can't wait!
DEWEY DEWEY DEWEY
Omg does Dewey die
OMG So Cute ♥ Funny Cats and Dogs https://youtu.be/D3zEp8JpS0s
What to expect for the latest ?
If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe He was raised from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
Oh my God😱😱
omfg so excited
I think we know who the killer is…….. it’s clay 🤫😂
No Sarah Michelle Gellar? Come on. Ridiculous.
NO WAY IVE BEEN WAITINF FOR THIS DAY MY ENTIRE LIFE
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay. My dream came true 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I never thought they could make this scary again. Well done
bye i thought  jenna ortega was gonna be a main character not opening kill 😭
https://youtu.be/LTcZdFoHNhc
Sid just can't catch a break.
WASUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
Sidney stays strapped #Pro2A
Trying too hard to be like Halloween.
This looks much more in tune with the original trilogy’s photography. 4 is way out of place. It always bothered me. I don’t know why.  I’m excited for this!!! 😁
Why would you... have an app... can't anyone just hack your house...
hey its hugie cambell
On the next kill count
You aren't exicted for this move?? You poor thing..
GHOSTFACE LIVES! I'm even more excited for this film, than I was for Scre4m! Ghostface looks terrifying, and I can't wait to see him Slash his way through the box office! FOR WES
This looks awesome! Also, was that Stu's house that I saw?
OMFG I'm hyped as fuck ! OMG Scream looks darker than ever in this movie !
Ill be watching
Can January hurry up already 😩 i seriously hope this doesn’t disappoint favourite movies
I feel like a little kid on Christmas morning. Wow I’m shaking with excitement
Hype.
Ridicolous trailer
You can’t convince me this isn’t stu
the beginning where her doors unlock and the text says this isnt amber and she answers the phone fucking goofy take it out
360 pallet loop that bichhh
Is anyone watching this because it actually looks good and not because they miss their lost youth? Cuz idk, the Ghostface mask feels so dated and silly now. Maybe it's just the effect of the times we're living in but I find this impossible to take seriously.
I bet you ghostface is a woman and I am looking for this new movie and but usually I don’t like new movies I am old fashioned movie guy
Supposed to be a Dimension films logo not paramount
Okay, hear me out. How cool would it be if Randy Meeks somehow survived and became the new Ghostface?
Has to be Stu - somehow. Maybe Loki opened up a variant of him that survived a 1990s CRT Falling on head
Mixed feelings
NOO WHY KILL OFF JENNA💔
Im so ready for GHOSTFACE I THINK SOMEONE KID IS TAKING OVER The MURDERS
Hollywood, you are pathetic! You haven’t come up with an original, GOOD idea this whole millennium so far. Remake after remake and they all suck!!!! Give it up.
Great trailer, looking forward to this movie! Scream will always be my favourite horror film.
Based on Courtney's reaction in the one shot, I'm guessing Dewey is toast in this.
Looks stupid, can't wait to see it.
Ok so we got Clay Jenson and Ellie Alves in the same movie… noice!
I lol'd at the "I've been through this..... a lot"
Omg What's Brooklynn doing Here?
So does this have to do anything with Scream 4 or we suppose to act like it don’t exist
I like how they put today actors with the original actors. This movie could have potential
This looks absolutely amazing
Oh my at the FEELS! I am so ready.
IM SO DAMN EXCITED!!!!!!
GhostFace and the OG’s are finally back ten years ago since the last one this is supposed be new era for new generations the title is just scream which is callback to Halloween and candyman.
This movie still should've been titled "5cream"
One of the rules don’t be friends with Sidney girls got issues
I’m not saying it’s Dillion Minet I’m just saying he’s the most well know outta the new actors and he’s the only one we didn’t see get attacked in the trailer🤷🏽‍♂️
ALRIGHT, did anyone else see Stu's house in the background?
Red Right Hand better play in the movie.
Billy is alive
Ghostface is back…Oh my God, what happened to Dewey?
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD! I AM HERE FOR IT! 🙌
It’s a great day to be a horror fan
I’m amber hehehehe 😈
*I've never watched these movies but I'm definitely considering watching them now* 👏🏻
This looks great! Cannot wait to watch!
"I'm Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun" 💪💪💪
Who still has a house phone lol.
Hell Yeah 🗡️
I'm all in!
I’ve been waiting for this for YEARS. I’m glad they didn’t give away too much in the trailer but I’m excited to see Neve, David and Courtney back. I hope we get surprise legacy characters back
"Hi, I'm Dewey Riley. I've been attacked & injured by Ghostface on 4 different occasions but I am still alive and I am in no way, shape or form involved with these murders."
how u not gona have this movie ready for halloween?
Sense when did Hughie break up with starlight?
Too hard to think of an original movie so just recycle some old shit that was once popular before Scary Movie made a mockery of it. Yeah good idea.
Looks fun. I’m in. 🤙
Welcome home Sidney Prescott! It’s an honor 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
goddamn does hollywood like profiting on nostalgia.
Love and miss Wes. This one feels different but I’m here for it!
Imagine if it's Stu who survived the first one !!! But never mentioned !!!
5CREAM
1:47 That subtle twitch ghost face does is such a nice touch, makes him seem more 'unnatural' and 'sinister' 👌
“It’s an honor, Sidney.” Well, there goes my theory of Ghostface being Stu.
It also looks like it's following the same way as the 2018 Halloween by being titled scream like the original
DeadByDaylight GhostFace confirmed?!?
2:02 it definitely seems like they spoiled ghostface a bit because I see long brown hair🤭
wasn't this a comedy movie?
WOOOOOOO
Ofcourse I can sense that "dylan minnette" is the villain
2:01 it looks to me like Gail is crying over Dewey's dead body
Don't be afraid it's only the beginning
Yihaaaaaaa scream 🤘🤘🤘
This looks stupid
How many times does this happen to Sydney Prescott, don't f*ck w/ the original lol 😂
I won't make this comment contextual. I already did that on another page.   My over, of the Scream saga, is Scream 2's internet interior. The internet life of that particular film is astounding, which naturally becomes all the more surreal, considering the deconstructive arc of the latest film
Who the heck still owns a landline? It’s 2021😂😂😂
“Do you know where I am? I could be anywhere, I’m like the wind baby” -ghostface 2022
Ah shit here we go again.
Wazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa chain
Omg less go I’ve been wanting a scream 5 since I saw the first one and that was like when i was 4 or 5 I love scream so much I’ve seen every single and even the tv show I can not wait until this comes out !!!!!! Hello Sydney!!!!!!!!
i like
Why can't they just name it "Scream 5"? Why nowadays they always call horror movie sequels by the original titles if they are not even remakes?
Honestly doesn’t look to good but I’ll watch it, comes out my birthday weekend
Welp, another stupid derivative horror movie that isn't even scary and is just goofy
ZzZzZzZzz why remake this  stupid movie? Whats so entertaining about a movie with a boring plot?
Well I know I'm gonna be sitting here for the next 3 months trying to figure out who the killer is gonna be
I guess they are running out of ideas and keep remaking films for the younger generation
Sweet, this movie comes out on my birthday
This honestly looks shit.
Hollywood must be thirsty, I’ll go grab some milk
If Jason and Freddy return, you already know what's gon' happen. #INTOTHESLASHERVERSE
The killer is the police chiefs kid
The cast actually made me so hype
🔥
every sequel or tv show after the first one is garbage, this looks like shit too
Bet
Is this scream 6
Just in time for Hollow..... Valentine's Day?
The piggy bank got a bit empty so you figured you may as well milk the money cow again.
Please don't tell me Dewey die... oh god...
Football player is the killer, sorry all
Is the killer just gonna be a fan of the horror movies just like the first one?
This'd better be good.
My guess: Jenna survives the opening and she's the one in the wheelchair!
I can’t wait it looks so good! I can’t believe the house is back!!!
No build up whatsoever, way too fast paced and no humor. Overly serious and dramatic tone all throughout. You can tell Kevin Williamson didn't write it and of course you can tell Wes didn't direct it. Ghostface also doesn't seem to have the intentionally goofy movements and the entire new cast is made of decent looking models instead of actors.  Above all, there's not a single movie reference or any meta element at all. No self references...just nothing.
So either Billy was a bad boy and cheated on Sidney and that person had his kid or That ghostface voice in the beginning sounds like someone had their vocal cords hurt...Stu?
I love Scream and Scream 2 (ok I'll throw Scream 3 in there as well) as I grew up watching them. I felt Scream 4 was a big disappointment. I hope this one makes up for it.  "Liver alone!"
Should be titled Scre5m
YESSS
Omg Yes it's Ghostface he's back!!!! Woooooo hooooo yeah about time. And with the original cast to no way. Wes must be extremely proud
Are slasher films making a comeback? First we had the amazing Halloween 2018, Halloween Kills comes out in 3 days, and now a new Scream movie?
About time!
Scream in modern day, this will be interesting. probably shoulda announced it in like July so it could come out in spoopy season
Ooooooohhhhh
F YEAHH!
FiveCream
I may have to marathon the franchise just before this comes out.
I bet Dewey is the killer!  🙉
Kinda shocked so many people care about this
I can’t wait 😩❤️
Jesus loves you and died for you because your a sinner who’s condemned to hell  accept him and repent of your sins to get to heaven He’s the only way. I hope you have a good day or morning or afternoon where ever you may be and God bless you take care
Weird Flex but this movie is made a day after my birthday
IM SO FUCKING READY
still should have called it Scream 5
I’ve literally watched this trailer like 8 times today
And here I am still waiting for Top Gun to be released in theaters…
YEESS
"What's your favorite scary movie?" - Ghostface
They kill off Jenna Ortega just like that
Looks very promising....although I'm a little tired of this trend with horror franchise sequel titles. 5th film in the series and 2 of them have the same title. Ugg.  #scream5 Hahahaha
It's gonna be a scream, baby!
Watch out! Ghostface has Hex:NOED!
same shit different day. hollywood needs original movies.
I can tell already this will be superior to Scream 4! So exciting. I really hope it makes money so we can get some more.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It’s a woman killer /thread
YAASS
Dewey dies I’m calling it now
AMO
This seems too... basic
That's stu's house at the end right?
that’s what she gets for still having a landline
YESSSS!!! GHOST FACE IS BACK BABY!!!!
13 reasons why Ghostface killed me… I see what you are planing here Dylan 😂😉
corny.
Omg.
Deffo a weird vibe to this film but I think I’m gonna like it
ахуенно))
The house at the beginning gives me nightmare on elm street vibes
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates.🎈
Calling it now Clay is the killer.
Uhh where's the humor and irony?
Yeah!!!
In memory of Wes Craven. (1939-2015)   He will be missed. 😇
They brought back the original ghost face voice and the original cast is coming back. I can’t wait to see this plus it’s an early birthday gift to me!!!
Happy they didn't title this "5CREAM"
Can’t wait I hope Wes craven comes back
LETS GO MY FAVORITE MOVIE IS GETTING A NEW ONE!!! LETS FREAKING GO!
why are studios tryna wrap up horror movies all of sudden ?? not a fan
This is going to be the best Scream movie yet!!!!!
JENNA ORTEGA RECREATING DREW BARRYMORE’s OPENING SCENE ! THAT’S MY SISTER
Can't wait for james to cover the next installment of this series
A Halloween movie coming in theatres in January LOL  Also shitty remake typical doo doo  Come up with something original
“Welcome to the Kill Count! Where we tally up the victims in all our favorite horror movies! I’m James A. Janisse and today we’re looking at Scream, which came out in 2022.”
Our girl Sidney can't catch a break. Looking forward! Yes!
Copying Halloween 2018 script plot
I CANT WAIT FOR THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!! Been waiting and waiting!!!! I knew eventually they would make another one!! But I hate that Wes is no longer with us.. but I know he would’ve LOVED THIS🥺🔪🩸❣️❤️
Yessss
"Of course I have a gun" Scream 3 is the only movie where she was smart enough to have  a gun. And people have the nerve to call that the dumb movie...lol One day they'll learn...
Calling it. Dylan O'Mite is the killer
The most important rule: Every horror film sequel should have a different title...
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
What’s up with this trend of making a new horror movie with the same exact title? It takes away from the legacy of the og movies. They coulda called it 5CREAM or something different lol
This looks so bad
“Would you like to play a game?”  Wrong movie Ghostface
NO WAY! THE MOVIE RELEASES ON MY BIRTHDAY!!!!
It looks ok not gonna lie.
01:32 Epic chase!
I mean I’m intrigued of course, but it’s coming out in January…
Sidney just cut off your daughter's data plan and voila, scream for a whole new generation.
Ya man yeah baby your gonna love this
OK I’m gonna say it we all know we’re only here to watch it for the original cast🤣 If it wasn’t for them I wouldn’t be watching the film
Man this looks terrifying. Nice reboot feels while honoring the legacy. I'm here for it
Calling it now, Dewey is the mastermind after all this time.
WAIT WHATTTT
LET'S GOOOOOO!!!!!
Some part of me really wants Sydney to be the killer
Nope ... Covid ( 2020 ) will still remain the masterpiece
That iconic 'HELLO SYDNEY MOMENT' at 2:06 ❤️👍❤️😁 GOOSEBUMPS 👍
I am so excited for this!! I have seen a lot of people saying Stu is alive. There is no way. He was bleeding out, had a 60 lbs tv dropped on his head, and was electrocuted. Even if police and paramedics showed up and were able to save him, don't you think Sid, Gayle, Dewey, and Randy would have been told? He did try to kill all of them after all.  He may have gotten a girl pregnant right before the events of 1 and his kid found out the history and is now seeking revenge, possibly. Stu is Dead. The new "final girls" may have moved into Stu's house and that is why the house is in the trailer. I do agree that one of the OG 3 will die.
Just call it Scream 5 or 5cream! This stupid craze of having sequels using the original IP's name is so annoying.
Another remake... Great...
Seems Ghostface got powers now
That doors lock system is my nightmare ... Losing control to that extend is very panic inducing.
Cool but...why January?
Wasn't Scream originally a comedy? Or.. what am I thinking of.
🤷🏾‍♂️
IT LOOKS SO GOOD, CAN'T WAIT!!!!!
Please just leave it at this trailer. No final trailer.
I just can’t take this seriously….I just keep seeing scary movie😂😂😂😂😂
The Killer is definitely Adam Brody, but who's the other one? What surprises are you hiding this time, Ghostface.
😱🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪🩸
You'll scream when the killer is revealed.
The ghostface costume is so simple yet so cool  Love it
Trailer is cool as heck but did you noticed in 00:24 that there is cut already on her shirt just before she was attacked? tf?
This looks dope as hell
Do you think Jill and Kirby have returned?
kjjjj justo hoy por primera vez vi scream Y SALE UNA NUEVAAA aaaaa amo
Dose Ghostface sounds different?
I was expecting Sonic movie 2! But I'll still wait...
I can't even. This looks amazing
Is it just me or at 1:26 the ghostface shadow looks to be raising his knife above his head the way Stu would hold his knife when attacking? Obviously it cuts away before that but it looks like that's what he was doing... anyone else think so?
SCREAM is the saga for which I am passionate about horror films; Wes Craven would be proud of the return of Ghostface to the big screen alongside the queens of the franchise (Scream Queens) Neve Campbell (Sidney Prescott), Courteney Cox (Gale Weathers), of course the great David Arquette (Dewey Riley). It has given me a sense of fear when they mention that Ghostface is related to the original assassins; It will certainly be a great movie.
FUN FACT: At 1:37 that is actually Tara carpenter who is in the wheel cause at 1:54 you can see Sam running at the hospital to save Tara so Tara isn't the opening kill and also another fun fact the killer is the girl with the magenta streaks if you look that's the top of her hair color and it isn't Mindy cause she being attacked by ghostface
michael Meyers, Chucky and now Ghost Face are back...I think we have time traveled back to the 90s guys lol
Love scream. Like the TV show too.   It's all good.
Ghosty back in business
i feel like the “doors unlocked” app but was a really good use of modern technology in a similar context of the original. well done!!
THEY SHOULD BRING BACK STU BECAUSE HE MIGHT HAVE SURVIVED THE TV
All I want is Stu back. Is that to much to ask😂😂
In the Theaters: "Hey Dad, what that brick that you can make calls with?" Dad: "That my child is a piece of history...."
I can see the movie sin count already. It's 2020 girl using a house phone than a cell phone.
Oh God.. It's a January release... Now I'm worried
YESSS
Looking good, will definitely watch it when its out.
I hope there’s a sweet twist of a ending
Smells like just an another January dump movie to avoid taxes
Wazzuuup
why is Dylan Minnette in this lmao
"Hello Sidney... It's an honor..."  Amazing!💯
I wish Stu was still alive so he could be the killer again he was always my favourite in the original 😂😂😂
Русские фаны Крика, вы где? дайте сигнал!  Это Крик, детка!
“There’s a formula. A VERY SIMPLE FORMULA!!!!!”
https://youtu.be/pU8qiNwR4Xo
Sidney Prescott is the ultimate final girl. Icon.
Welcome back Ghostface. Its been 25 years since the first Scream came out. Good to see Ghostface back.
One of the original 3 will die in this one.
Scream’s back bitches
Wuzzzzzzzzuppp
Welcome back, Sidney and friends! 🔪
Why is it not called scream 5 when it is a sequel?
I hope they show someone get gutted a fish this time.
Got an ad for this movie and it looks like a return to the first two....can't wait
I have a feeling it's RANDY
plastic knife
Wasuuuuuuuuuuuup!!!
Now this feels like a real horror movie
So cool to see Stu’s house 26 years later
COME back legend SCREAM. COMING SOON.
Still pissed this took 10 years to come out lol. Glad it's finally here though☺️
FUCK ME YES!!!! YES! YES! YES!
The brother didn't even survive the trailer😩
I bet you it’s the mf cop 🤔
So Sydney said “until he’s put back into the ground” although it could just be casual writing but they might try to throw us off here as well as what Stu said in the first movie is that “a girl can’t be the killer” they might try to go sideways on us and have it be 2 female killers so I think the Asian chick and the pink haired chick just my guess
Hells Yeah!! Bring it.
Dewey’s the killer, calling it
I’m calling it its the shorty that says “I KNOW WHO YOU ARE”
If they’re all related to the original killer, I’m guessing the killers are Stu, and a family member of Billy’s.
Party at Stu Machers, its gonna be a SCREAM!!!👻🔪
i would have to say that I think Stew is the killer (if he survived getting a tv smashed onto his head). i think that in scream 1 he didn’t complete what he wanted to, which was killing Sydney, so i think he will be the killer in scream 5 after being gone for 2-4 (which could’ve been his recovering time).
releasing in January lol. DUMP MONTH yall know this pure trash
This looks good already!
Wait original Stu house
OMGG
Who has a landline in 2022?
IT’S A SCREAM BABY!!!
This looks bad ass can’t wait !!😄
THE WAIT IS FINALLY OVER! This is going to be so good!
Crap
The scariest part is that he can use Google Home to help murder you.
LET'S GOOOO
yep...looks like a scream film lol
The killer seems much more sadistic just like in the classics. I’m glad they’re going to back to their roots and also trying something new.
I love how at the start when he says "would you like to play a game" he references Jig saw.
wazzzzuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1:59 Please don’t kill off my boi Hughie
Neve, wearing that iconic scream 2 leather jacket. With her long hair, instead of short. Is beautiful :)
We better see more of Courtney Cox in this one! We didn’t see much of her in scream 4
What is it the dog this time are they running out of people with links
The movie seems more psychological than the last 2 movies. I like that, I like the suspense and build up of the classics.
LETS GOOOOOO
No they kill Dewey
Lol does this ghostface drapes look like funworld drapes or is it actually 3 slits like the way it's supposed to be i couldn't tell. And ghostface doesn't wear a belt never noticed that. Im saying so i can get my costume right for Halloween 🎃  as I am gonna be wearing 3 different masks tho the bloody ghostface regular and devil face mask.
Yesssss
A fitting tribute to Wes, and let’s not forget in the description…Roger Jackson back as the voice of Ghostface!
Can I say I’m a bit disappointed!? I’m a HUGE fan of the Scream franchise and this trailer is not really what I was expecting. Where is the action? I really, really hope they get it right
Poor Syd can never catch a break
Idk why every couple years some idiot thinks they can try Sidney Prescott as if she hasn’t ended every single killer that comes after her. Sis STAYS ready for action. She is not the one to play with. Y’all gone learn one day.
Just remake/ruin everything fk it
Ahhh I'm so excited for this
My guess from Gail's face is maybe not that Dewey is dead, but it could also be Deputy Hicks. I mean yeah, she disliked her in Scre4m, but could also feel pain from it.
Looks amazing I love how they put in modern technology changes like the door app shit
I'm so excited. Going by the names of characters Randy has a niece and nephew, Mindy and Chad Meeks. Based on the trailer saying that the killer is attacking people connected to the original killings there are probably more direct connections that we don't know of.
Yo!!! It's back!
Halloween and scream let's goooooo🎃🔪
this is gonna be suck a bad movie
Calling it right here and now, the main (or one of the main) killers is that guy from The Boys
IM ACTUALLY CRYING IT LOOKS SO GOOD
Pass. Should've stopped at 3.
Nick gage is the killer
Imagine getting Jenna Ortega and killing her in the opening scene
A movie like that in 2022 is absolutely anachronistic. I’m speachless. That’s literally Scary Movie level! Maybe even funnier…All the people that are celebrating for this movie are completely crazy. U can see from the trailer that it contains all the possible cliches of all the horror movies ever made and ,despite that, u can’t wait to go to see it??? I swear, when it started I was 100% sure that it was a parody.
So far looks like it's a great modernisation. Intense trailer.
Scream V is here!
*5 seconds into the trailer* Me: this looks terrible..  *movie comes out january*  Me: ah. That makes sense.
🔥🔥🔥
The main girl is the killer this time, sorry for spoiling.
I’m so excited for this!!!! Has made my day!
lmao why tf did she open the door at the beginning 💀
Actually so fucking hyped for this
Yes yes yes yes !!!!!!
It's time to scream!!!!
"I'm Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun."    *Best line in the trailer*
Will Kirby be in it?!?!   Very excited for this movie!!!
This looks pretty great. Hate that it’s just called “scream” when it’s clearly a sequel
I hope I'm wrong but this looks really dumb. The way they handle Sidney finding out it's happening again seems as tired and rehashed as a fifth movie. What's original about this? The trailer would suggest nothing is novel here. Hope I'm wrong.
Damn! Looks good! Now to check out the video saying it lied. 😂
Why are they make this movie again? For fuck sakes.
This may seem like a controversial comment, but I’m honestly glad this franchise is being taken over by other filmmakers. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson really lost their mojo with Scream 4. It was way too campy, all of the jokes fell flat, and there was no tension or suspense. These new filmmakers seem to be bringing a gritty edginess to the franchise, which is exactly what it needs.
I’m pumped
So basically Dewey is toast in this one.
He kills people related to the original killers?
What's uuuuup
Let's goooooo!!! Can't wait!!!
Lil worried about Dewey... Hope the originals make it through.
love love love
o my fffffffffffffff gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
Holy crap I'm excited!!!!
Who else noticed the opening scene and image of Tara is very reminiscent of Casey Becker? I mean after all...it's always someone we know, right? 😉😉😉
This isn't out for Halloween because??!!??
Oh shooooooooot YO THIS SCARY AS HECK
There making another one 😂
Oml let’s gooooo I have been waiting frfr !!!!!
I WANT IT NOW!!!!!
yay my favortie movie! i grow up watching it
Who came here after watching the Halloween Kills trailer?
I really hope we get to hear Ghostface’s menacing laugh 😜
It's gonna be a SCREAM baby!!! Thank you for keeping this franchise alive! It looks awesome!!! <3
THIS LOOKS AWESOME
I’m cheering as this trailer plays!!! I’m so hyped for this!!!!!!!!! 👻👻👻
Looks amazing 👏🏻 can’t wait 🔪🩸
Waited years for this!!!! Let’s go Sid 💪🏽🔪
LET'S FUCKING GO BABY
FUCK YEAH!!!
Guys, what are your thoughts on a 6th installment have two killers on screen in a chase scene? I have wanted to see this for so long.   I wish I could message the directors with a ton of messages about a scene of this nature.
Perfect timing after watching Scream 25th Anniversary in theaters this past Sunday. 😎 The audience loved it and everyone applauded at the end of the movie.  CAN'T WAIT! LET'S GO!  P.s. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!!! 😱😱😱😱😱
Plot twist: The killer is Sidney Prescott. 😱🔪
My only concern is this being a January movie. Usually movies released in January end up being hot garbage with horrendous reviews. It's a bit of a red flag
Dylan Minnette is in Scream 5??? That was unexpected .
I hope Ghostface does a lot of Killing
i’m praying for stu to be the killer
"Would you like to play a game?" Wrong line my friend
I'm just gonna imagine that wes craven did this movie
Finallyyy
I hope Tara doesn't get murdered. Jenna Ortega comes across like such a nice girl.
Tomorrow Sonic 2 trailer
This looks terrifying it will definitely make us SCREAM!
Who tf opens their door in a situation like that?
They just pulled a Casey Becker style move with killing off someone who we thought was the main character in the opening sequence. Damn that’s BOLD!
Ah yes, the old phone call opening for the hundredth time
Back in white
Hurry up January!
I cliked the like button before watching
before watching the trailer: another easy cashgrab reboot because hollywood doesn't know how to make movies anymor-  after watching the trailer: Ok, it legit looks fun
Scary movie should come back after this!! With DOOFY!!!!!
Can't wait for Scream Kills and Scream Ends
Cindy is probably the killer and it’s been her all along.
JENNA ORTEGA 💝💝💝
Daaaamn!!! The new year already has something to look forward to.
Just find a pallet ez
I CANT WAITTTTT!!!🩸🖤
I don't know why, but I think Hughie (from the Boys - Jack Quaid) is the killer🔪😁
IM HYPED 😤
Finally I've been waiting all my life for another sequel
🖤🖤🖤🖤🤍🤍🤍😆😆😆 so excited
I can’t believe we get Laurie and Sidney all within a few months 😍😭😭 this is a dream come true
Just like Michael,he will tear them all apart
It's a give away, they are back at Stu's house, Stu was awesome, he didn't die in the original, he is back, and he is the killer...
I have been watching the Scream movies since i was 3 years old and i am so excited 🖤
Dude still slashing with a knife... Get a fucking gun like everybody else
Omg😍😍😍😍♥️🔪😂🔪😂🔪
Oh hell yeah
this IS real. finnallyyyy
Amazing
hoping tara isn’t the opening kill, looks like her in the wheelchair please!!
So unrealistic.  A landline in 2021? Totally unwatchable.
The fact that the cast keeps comin back is 💖💖💖
Which one of Sydney’s family members is it this time?
Holy Crap! Talk about reviving a classic! Damn why January we need this movie this month!! OCTOBER BABY!!!
sidney looks FAIIIIYYYNEEEEEEEE
Hopefully they don't make the movie so serious to the point where it isn't meta but besides that I'm super excited for this movie
Yesssssssssssssss
Yes out on my birthday 🎂 🥳.
JENNAAAAAAAA 😭😭😭
Ghostface is back and ready to make everyone *scream* !
“Hello Sydney… it’s an honor.”  CHILLS!!!
The 90s were 30 years ago.  Let old franchises die, like they should.
yesss
1:33 it sounds like he is saying “No, Sam, wait”...hmmm
Okay okay this could actually be a return to form though 👀
Is…is that…THE MACHER HOUSE?
This one feels special
looks good
I think Dewey is a red herring and they'll actually kill Gail off. Can't wait for January! I'm excited!
LIKE WHY KILL JENNA OFF
Wazzzuuuppp!
Wouldn’t it be cool if Ghostface did something like the Dbd mori in this movie….
I AM SO BEYOND EXCITED FOR THIS THIS WILL BE MY FIRST SCREAM MOVIE I GET TO SEE IN THEATERS SKFHSAKDFHLKSADJF
Killer is definitely a female, placing my money for the bet now!
Get your pitchforks ready. If they kill Sidney Prescott, I say we storm Paramount Pictures!
It's an honor 🔪
This drops on my birthday 🙌🏽 ima go see it 😭 I loved me some scream movies
Our boi Ghost face is making a comeback along with the others, let's get it, bru!!!!!!!!
Love itt
That looks good
Finally
Yesss
"How did you know my landline was ringing?" Things that today's teens say everday... :D
Just went to see the first one in the theater on this past Sunday... What a gem!!! Let's go!!!!!! It's a 🗣️SCREAM BABY!!!!!!
Can't wait
Ate que fim
This hit 1 million views in just 5 hours how believable is that?
THEYRE BACK
“Fuck the rules” - Ghostface, probably
I wonder if Ghostface will ever be in combat game like MK, injustice, taken of street fighter
I've not seen one scream film and I'm cool with that
OMFG OMFG SHES ABCK AHHHH
*IT'S A SCREAMING TIME BABY*
Still making these tf!!
Oohhh yeeahhhhh
It’s time to SCREAM!!!!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Can never take these movies seriously since Scary Movie 1.
2:00 omg is dewey dead?!
OMGG OMG OMGGGG
They litterally spoiled all the kills and action of the movie
“whatever his link is to our past” ……. stu?
Ain’t no way y’all just killed off Jenna Ortega, she was my only reason for watching this movie smh 🤦🏻
The question isn't who am I, the question is where am I. Let's go! 🩸🗡
High hopes that this one kicks major ass! Based on the trailer, I'm sure it will be amazing! 👍
Clay Jensen is the killer…hes voice is distinctive even behind the voice box! 😂😂😂 (dude with the white hair for those who don’t know who I’m talking about.) lol
alternate timeline Huey
Scary!
Why the fuck would you release a horror movie in January?
Hey, another Remix movie. Doesn't look too horrible. BTW a Remix movie is like a reboot but it's taking an original movie/franchise with the same elements that made it popular but adding slightly different elements. Also often a Remix movie is self aware to a various degree. Imagine if Beethoven could come back & put out Fur Elise 2 that was the same song but with a EDM beat on top as a remix of the original. Other movies in recent years are Jay & Silent Bob:reboot, Coming 2 America, Ghostbusters21, Matrix 4, Independence Day 2 and a few others. You can tell it's a Remix movie by when they use a lot of the same scene shots or visual styles, same writing & so forth. Also the main characters of the original movie or franchise are not the main characters in the Remix movie. It differs from a reboot in the self awareness, also a reboot often picks up a story where the last one left off even if it's years later. If this Scream movie were only about Sidney & gang as the leads then it would be a reboot.
FINALLY!!!
I don't see the point?
HELL YEAH
Aaaaaaaaaa não vejo a hora
Love it cant wait
"Hello, Sidney.... it's an honor...."   CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE
🤩🙌
Here for Monica Geller 😍
DYLAN🖤🖤🖤🖤...Oh, and cool movie, can't wait. Plus...I really love how my generation has Nightmare, Friday the 13th, Halloween to look back on a reminisce about being little, getting scared, who they watched with, etc. Reading these comments about some being kids when the original Scream came out and getting excited for this in the same way is so , well, it makes me happy. Horror fans are the best! 🔪🎃🕯💀  peace & love to all💜
There's a shot of Gale screaming, do you think Dewey dies in this one? She looks horrified in the shot. 2:00
1:38  1: You can't have Sex 2: You can't drink alcohol or do drugs 3: Never ever ever ever Say "I'll be Right Back" Cuz You won't be back
Samantha is the ghostface
So can't wait for January this loojs awesome
Ha! Millennials and smart phones! Oh let me use my phone to lock my front door with 😂
By the way, why do I think Dewey is going to die, Sidney & Gale better not die
This is giving me Halloween reboot vibes. I really hope they infuse meta commentary and humor into this, as that’s what made the other movies so great.
Meh
I rarely get excited over a movie like this... But OooooMmmmGgg!!! I've been hooked since the original!!! I can't hardly wait!!  ;-)
Yes so hyped
Oh heck yeah!!!!!!
5CREAM- This probably sounded cool at first but then it’s read as 5 Cream.
This is badass
IM GONNA THROW UP FROM EXCITEMENT
Hell yeah!!!
Ghostface is fire 🔥. Hope it will be good 👍
Movie: let's come up whit BS information so that viewers would believe.  Me: Who The Fuck u think u fooling whit this garbage trailer lol
"Hello Cindy" "What's your favourite scary movie"
Yessssss! So many memories!!!!
Great, now they're gonna ruin Scream again.
can’t wait
2 quotes  “He attacks well on people related to the original killers” Who has a motive to kill people related to the original killers? Sidney Prescott? Perhaps she’s snapped Ave she thinks she’s doing a service? “Hello Sidney, it’s an honor”  Maybe that’s ever second killer reading Sidney that it’s honor to work with her.  Sidney Prescott is no longer the final girl. The more they keep her around the more people are going to want her to be the final girl.  Some will still see Sidney as the victim and try to follow in her footsteps in the sequels to avenge her. I think that’s a story Wes would approve of. But even if I’m wrong, I’m still excited to see it.
This is gonna be EPIC!!! They kept the same vibe of the originals! I couldn’t be more hyped!!!
Wow, 100% thought this would be called "the Scream", but they literally just titled it the same as the first one. Lazy AF, not even Scream 5 atleast? Or make the S a 5?
Yeeeeeeaaaaahhhh
“Hello Sydney, it’s an honor”  That doesn’t feel personal like the other killers before. So I’m guessing this killer, or possibly killers, are fans of the previous ones and getting inspiration from them to go after the people they are personally invested in this time.
This trailer was better then Scream 3 and 4 combined 😂
I've been waiting 10 years, 5 months, and 29 days for this trailer 🔪
Yeah, why the fuck not?!
This JAN-uary  it's time to Michael down your Vincents.
I fully believe Stu never died. Fun fact, he was originally scripted to come back for scream 3. It’s very very possible. I think he came back 🙅🏻‍♀️
So is this another Halloween situation where it ignores all the sequels and picks up years after the original?
STU'S HOUSE LETS GOOOO
No matter what, GHOSTFACE ALWAYS COMES BACK!!!!!!!!
I CAN'T WAIT! 😍
This better not suck like number 4!
I guess Scre5m wasn’t a good enough title.
"The attacks were all on people related to the ORIGINAL killers."  Very interesting line drop. So they're killing Stu and Billy's relatives? Or people from their lives they knew besides Sydney and Randy? Maybe they'll throw in a younger brother for one of them? or a cousin? Maybe the killer is a relative? I gotta say, with that one line, I am intrigued.
Lol let’s open the front door so I can get stabbed 😂🤣 still love these movies though! I’m excited 😆
January. Oh no
So excited!
1:21 looks like stu’s house!
This looks awesome.
Did they spoil who could be ghostface or did they spoil who is working with ghostface in the trailer?
I usually hate sequels but for scream “cause face it baby cause these days you gotta have a sequel”
That's no the opening scene.
. . . And calling this one just _Scream_ isn't going to confuse it *at all* with the 1996 original? How about a different name . . . maybe?
Just looks like Halloween 2018 but doubt anyone is gonna point that out.
$100 bucks says Dewey dies.
I'm calling it. Cameraman must be the killer.
Horror movie of 2022
SO EXCITED FOR THIS 🔪🔪🔪💥💥💥
CAN’T FREAKIN WAIT SO FREAKIN EXCITED 😆
Can't wait
Why the fuck is this being made? Fuck this!
Cringeeee
Well I've not been disappointed thus far so fkin bring it can't wait!
It's SCREAM baby and this one doesn't look as cheesy as I remember the others and I love it.
YES!!!
My guess is the plot of the movie is the son or the daughter of a passed killer is getting revenge for the death of their parent from the past movies.
I'm absolutely excited to see Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, and David Arquette as their respective characters again. However, it is a shame that Wes Craven is no longer with us to direct this sequel.
At 1:14 you can see Vince (Loomis).. he will for sure be killed and that would be related to one of the original killers (Billy)
Not sure how I feel without Wes, but it's nice seeing the original cast. I look forward to watching.
Very excited about this… until the January garbage heap release date: the studio vote of no confidence
Courtney Cox looks as scary as ghostfsce
Cool cast, but the tone seems way off. I figured the Ready or Not guys would keep the sense of humor in tact but I'm kinda worried. This seems like a generic slasher to me.
Tbh this movie looks predicable if u watch the trailer closely… my prediction is that the killer is the kid from 13 reasons why… he’s the killer…
AAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!! IM FAN GIRLING TF OUT! 😃
Dewy seems to be alone a lot in the trailer and is shown on the hospital floor.  2:00 also shows Courtney Cox being absolutely crushed by something...  I think our boy Dewy might be dying this time around
Wow! I can't wait to watch it. I love all the movies in the "Scream" series. Yes, even part 3 and 4. 😱  #ScreamMovie #Scream5
Good time to be a horror/slasher fan  Good to see the classics all being revived. Now we need Freddy and Jason to join the party
WHAAAAAAAT .  OG S UNITE ✊...IT'S COMING
Same shit, different year. Another failed attempt to kill Sidney.
Think I might actually catch this in theaters
I wish Kirby was in this one since we didn't officially see her death or body in Scream 4 but I think Hayden's acting days are behind her.
Sooooooooo down
Spoiler the killer is  billy, Stu, Mrs loomis, Mickey, Roman, Charlie and Jill. 👍🏻 yup all of them 😂
My money is on it being a fan trying to "revitalize the franchise"
Wuzzzzuuuup! 👻
Yay! Love these films
Yet another wrestler trying to make it in Hollywood. GO BACK TO WCW WHERE YOU BELONG, ARQUETTE!
This looks good
It would be genius if ghostface tbags his victims when he gets them to the ground
If you think about it, the scream franchise has always been about family, fame & revenge lol
Gale and Dewey got a divorce forsure, he is living in a trailer park home.
Neve Campbell is back and Ghostface is too. Im so excited!
It’s look awesome I’m so excited 🔪🔪
So excited
RIP my baby Dewey : (
I hope the opening is good! Because Wes Craven definitely knew how to give us some great openings every Scream movie.
Why i will never have a Smart house...i prefer old fashioned locks and lights...
So beyond excited!
Welcome Home Sydney 🔪
Woodsboro: Welcome to your tape...
Unrealistic, every murican house has 2.5 guns.
Ghost face sounds creepier
Calling it now the killer is Stu who actually survived
I'm fucking hype
Damn this is❤️‍🔥
Lets fucking goo ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Dewey looks like Messi 🤣
Is dewy a badass
'' I know who you are '' Harriet Jones?
Where is Kirby.? 🥺 I thought it's confirmed that she's alive after the events of Part 4.? 🥺😭
“hello, sidney. it’s an honor” is giving true crime stannie so im excited to see what kinda We Live In A Society we get outta this one
Definitely the best trailer I’ve seen in a long time NO NEED FOR ANYMORE
SIDNEY AND GALE LOOK SO GOOOOD
Why is it titled the original "Scream" when it's not the original ?
I'm a bit down on this, I watch scream too much but this feels too much of a retread for a series that revisits its past movies every iteration. Unless you never actually saw the movies?
👎🏻😑👎🏻😑👎🏻😑
"The Final Girl Support Group" with, hopefully, better writing ?
I just want to know who the fuck has a land line in their house still?
Could be 3 instead of 2 this time. Hell maybe a cult lol
Wes Craven's spirit surely will smile at this
Us: ahhh shit here we go again  Sydney: ahhh shit here we go again for the 5th time
iv watched this over and over again
this looks way better than the previous one!
GIRLS ITS SPOOKY SEASON BABE!! 😉
Comes out on my birthday!!
I'm glad they're not trying to play this like a fresh reboot. Instead brining back some of the original cast and clearly tying it in to the past movies.
It look amazing but I wish they wouldn't show us the kills yet I want to be surprised
Hell YES!!!! Excited is an understatement!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSAHHHHHHH
Ghostface returns! This looks awesome 🙌
What a time to get into this franchise, and this drops and looks freaking INCREDIBLE I’m so stoked!!
Ok. I watched this 5 times, the last time frame by frame.  I just saw the OG in the theatre last night. The final scene is back at Stu's house.  Gail is losing her shit in one frame. Are they going to say her and Dewey had a kid together? And that kid got attacked? Killed? This is INTENSE AF!!!! I was on the fence of making another film without Wes but.... I can't wait!  EDIT: Checked IMDB - no kid with the last name Riley..... so....... poor Dewey?
lmao this is fucking stupid give it a rest
5CREAM at last!
scream 5 gonna be astronomical. a7x // scream
Should be called Scream 5 no?
1:44 lol is she supposed to be related to Billy Loomis? She did that neck crack he liked to do plus they showed right as they were saying that line about the attacks being on people related to the originals
STOP THE " hello sidney" FROM GHOSTFACE I GOT CHILLS-
Si no sale el WASAAAAAAAAAAP!!!! no la voy a ver.
Omg…… credits “In Memoriam of Wes Craven 1939 - 2015… R.I.P”
Most important thing. IS DOOFY IN THIS??
Nobody expected this
That shot with Gale screaming, I’m thinking Dewey got killed.
🤩🤩🤩🤩🔥🔥🔥
Looks like they kicked up the brutality, by a lot.
So hyped can't wait
Samantha’s the killer. The fact that I was able to spot the killer in the first trailer is not a good sign. This movie looks cheap and like it was made on a very low budget, like a fan-made film. The scares look awful and so does the direction. I don’t get why everyone in the comments seems to be praising it. Are you all that easy? This just looks like a quick Hollywood cash-grab like Scream 4 was, and that movie sucked.
Yeah I wanted a smart lock for my doors until this trailer lmao  I have been waiting so long for this movie though, I can't wait! ❤️
Sidney Prescott is the Laurie Strode to the Scream franchise.
Wtf people still have home phones
Looks lame, the original was good because it was the 90's and just had that feel to it.
I was 1 when this franchise started in '96. Still a good franchise and can't wait to see this.
"I'm Sidney Prescott." Of course have a gun." Duh. Sidney's no fool. "Hello, Sidney." It's an honor." Chilling line only the one and only Ghostface can deliver.
You want to be with the big boys huh? Manson? bundy? Reckon it's Billy dad lol
Woo!
Gale as screamed at Dewey's "Death" before - like the sound studio at in 2. I wont buy Dewey dead until movie is over and credits have finished rolling
Another reboot/sequel nobody asked for.
5Cream is coming!
I saw a studio copy of it… David Arquette is the killer saved you guys your $12.00  You’ll thank me later
IT LOOKS SO FREAKING GOOD AND BEST OF ALL NO SEASON 1 DRAG RACE FILTERS!
Matrix 4 meets ScaryMovie 🤓
IT'S GOING DOWN!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥
QUE SABOR DELICIOSO 📢📢
yes im in love with it already
So excited to see scream 5
Neve Campbell, Biggest Crush on an Celebrity I have EVER had
In Ghostface Killer Tradition, it'll be someone good-looking and unexpected. Place your bets everyone!
I have "inside" information on who the killer is (since I helped do the makeup on set)... but, I'll never tell! What I can say is- THIS one is going to be a SHOCKER for sure! A real mind-twist. And no one will see it coming, until the very end! I was pleasantly surprised on how this film really does honor the Original, ties in all the follow-up sequels and yet STILL manages to create a path forward for a new generation & future storylines. Great writing, Great cast, Great movie!!!!!! 🔪🔪
Sooo... this means we're getting Scary Movie 6 right?  WITH Brenda and Cindy this time 😤
Lets fucking gooooooo
gale and sidney have not aged a bit
Its time for SCREAM !!🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟👻👻👻👻😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Wait... so Scream is the first one and Scream is the fifth one? Uh, bit confusing for a newcomer possibly but it looks good.           And I have a bad feeling Dewey is gonna die. ☹ they spoiled way to much in this trailer. You can practically tell if you spot who is getting killed.
Note to self: don't install smart locks...LOL
Imagine how many stab movies there are
can’t wait to see ghostface on the big screen 🔪
Who tf thought unlocking the doors with your phone was a good invention xDD
Well Damn it they better not kill off Ortega’s Character
Niceeee I dressed up as my mans two years ago let’s fkin go
So we just gonna show who’s gonna die ?
Dude a modernized scream with the OG SYDNEY PRESCOTT?! WHAT. DUDE
Yesss I can’t wait
In my eyes this is not a reboot but it's the 5th film in the series.
Awesome! 5cream
My guess is Mathew Lillard is the killer and the tv didn’t kill him. And he got arrested and then got free.
Man I like this interpretation of ghostface
Sidney and Gale be looking good in this film. They aged like fine wine.
Courteney Cox is looking very natural these days.
Welcome back!
AHHHHHHH
Dewie finally looks hardcore.
Hello Sidney...
“Related to the original killers” Interesting
Scream guy has been watching how to hack videos I see
This looks really damn good! will actually go to the theaters for this one!
Why release in January  Should have been released Halloween 2022
Sonic the hedgehog 2 trailer please
So glad to see Sidney back on screen  😌✌🏽
I'll be honest, I never liked any of the scream movies, but this one kind of has me curious
I was kinda hoping they would have called this 5CREAM
Bruh just watching some YouTube then this pops up in my screen did not expect this at all
it’s time
Eh should’ve released it on Halloween
Damn! It's been a long time *Hello* Sydney!
the trailer doesn't spoil anything!! THANK YOU
Yay!  2 Latinas Melissa Barrera & Jenny Ortega  Boo!  Down to 1 Latina
I’m so beyond ready and excited
This looks good. They better not fuck it up with some progressive woke shit...
First Halloween and now this? What is with the titles? Did the numbers go on strike?
I have a gut feeling Dewey is gonna die in this one
OMG I WANT TO SEE THIS 👀
i have a feeling that dylan minnette’s character is the killer
From Disney to getting brutally murdered 😔
AHHHHH LETS GOOO!! SO HYPED!!
OMG!!! CAN'T WAIT.... <3
So now gotta refer to this as Scream 2022? Why are they not calling it Scream 5?
Ok maybe these years won't be completely bad after all ❤️🤘🔥🙏
I have that exact same home phone, shit!!!
THIS IS AWESOME!!!! Can't wait to see!! :))
Great..... But why the hell did you call it "Scream"?! Confusing!
2:01  There is an ambulance and police, Gale screams, but All are kinda calm... So I assume someone dear to Gale is dead... Dewey?
This is how they should do it and to end the franchise... (Note, the voice of GhostFace is a little bit different)  ... Mid-way they kill/unmasked GhostFace, but there's always 2 killers, so the one would surprise them, but gets stabbed from behind, when he drops there's another GhostFace that the other imposters don't even know about.... Turns out to be matthew lillard!!! We won't know untill he says and they use the original ghostface voice, Hello Sidney, you miss me?  Of course we would had to figure out who it is from the original movie, but yeah it would matthew lillard because he was suppose to return in scream 3.
Halloween, Chucky, and now Scream?? Now all I need is a new nightmare and Friday and I'll be set
HYPE!
I watched the original scream but skipped out on the rest. Heard all the sequels are awful, is it true?
THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!!!!
This is why you should have a gun or something to protect yourself
Yo i have the mask and i hope i will be able to watch this movie in cinema
THIS LOOKS AWESOME!
Why did Courtney Cox get plastic surgery? it does not look good.
This one looks like it's gonna be good. Although I have a feeling that this time one of the big 3 won't survive in this... I guess will wait and see
Want a fun new Halloween song to add to your playlist?  Try Ghosted! 👻  https://youtu.be/Mdii3yYLIWQ
Whooooo!!!! Excited!
Almost sure Dewey dies. Unfortunately. Look the way Gale screams in desperate and  MAINLY the way Judy push the pedal to the ground: probably heading the local of Dewey's death. She is cryin a lot and desperate in her car. Dewey's deja vu of him telling the group the rules. The same thing Randy did in Scream 3 and remember what happened to him
The Ghost returns once more...
Stu's house ❤ i hope it ends where it began.
Mann I still miss the Randy Rules for these movies. Scream hasn't been great since 2. This has potential, but I don't want the killer reveal to be another new character that's been introduced in this one.
¿Did you notice the reference to the halloween theme at the end? 😱🔪🎃
Pumped. Should have been called Screams. Lol.
Please be good
Super exceed of my expectations
Sheeesh
I'm pretty sure Jenna Ortega won't die in the opening scene....👻👻👻👻
5CREAM
Ight so we got Micheal and Scream   Now I wanna see Jason
@0:51 does it look like the ghost face got a female body? Whoever it is got to be tall. Plus in the promo picture ‘it’s always someone you know’ it could mean another relative or one of the OG
The one thing I disliked about the Scream films was always the comedic tone. Looks like this one is going in a slightly darker direction. Nice.
Is it bad I've seen this 7 times already?!?! I am beyond excited for this!! 😱😱
I know it’s gonna happen! That new Scream movie is gonna be insane!
Are you guys ready for "Surprise Sidney"
Hell yeeessss!!!
Hello Sidney!!!!!! Ghostface is back! 👻🔪🔪🔪
that was fire
There are certain RULES
How does Sidney know it’s a he?!!!
I hope the killer is somebody from the original movie 🤔 I really hope it's Stu 😂😂😂😂😂
"Im Sidney Prescott of course I have a gun"   OH thank goodness courtneys hair isn't a mess this time
It actually looks good! Was scared the new generation teens would make it cringe like most movies do nowadays but it seems great with the original cast!
I’m so hype 😭❤️
This is why I'm keeping my locks analog as long as possible
I'm a very huge fan of scream franchise, can't wait to see it!. ❤️💋
2:06
Now all I need is an 'Nightmare on elm street' reboot.
the real ghost face is either dewey or the reporter forgot her name
HELLS YES!! I'M READY FOR THIS!!
1:43 its Clay Jensen!!!
At this point they should just stop trying to kill it. (But I'm still glad, I almost screamed) And why do the victims always open the door to run outside, I would choose to lock myself in the smallest room with my phone and bunk there until the police or someone shows up.
I'm sure that this will be an enjoyable Scream movie but I honestly can't take Ghostface seriously because of the Scary Movie parody scenes.
Ghost face back at it again to mess with teenagers the goat
I know it’s a long stretch and more of a wish 😭 BUT - WHAT IF THE NEW SCREAM REVEAL IS STU!! Matthew Lillard said he was supposed to come back for scream 3. So they were going to find a way to have him alive before maybe they find a way again..
The iconic ghostface is back I cant wait for it to come back!!
If only hollywood could come up with... Idk... An original idea? Is that too much to ask?
“Im Sidney Prescott, of course i have a gun”  That line gave me chills!!!!
Scream 1-3 were epic (YES 3 was epic), part 4 is shit and anyone disagree please end your miserable life. Part 5 mmmm (Hollywood always ruins it original classic, another way of saying part 5 is shit)
Fire 2 days after my birthday I'm definitely gonna see dis, and side note they gotta put Ghostface on the next mortal kombat game 🔥🙏🏽
First new Halloween and now a new scream  Woooooohooo
Call it scream 5 you cowards
Billy loomis’s little brother
My theory is that Vince is Sidney's son, in hiding all these years. The father is Derek from Scream 2. So Ghostface's alleged attack on Vince in this trailer is just a fake shot to fool us. And Richie may be Stu's son, physically he is very similar. The killers are Stu and his son.
1:23 the hippie lived!
These new horror films look cheesy mane
So excited. I just love how every scream movie has its moments and highlights, there is no weak one in the franchise. This definetly looks like a step up. I'm glad slasher horror are getting better.
NAHHHH🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who does the voice of the killa?
I hope its actually scary im so tired of comedy
Mi teoría es que Vince es el hijo de Sydney, oculto todos estos años. El padre es Derek de Scream 2. Asi que el supuesto ataque de Ghostface a Vince en este trailer solo es una toma falsa para engañarnos. Y Richie puede ser el hijo de Stu, fisícamente es muy parecido. Los asesinos son Stu y su hijo.
finally
Something tells me it’ll probably be taras sister and the guy that plays clay in 13 reasons why and they’re probably linked to Stu in a way
Did anyone shout “ Hello Sydney” too 🤣
Looks darker than the others
IM SO EXCITED! LETS GOOOOOOOOO
This does feel different.
CREAMINGGGGGG!!!!!!!!
Yes!!!!!!! Finally
Why am I the only one that thinks this looks basic asf, not to mention stupid
YEAAH
ICONIC.
Hello Sydney 🔪
Dewey's been through so much... 🔪 🏃 🔪
"Hello, Sydney.. It's an honor."  OMG YESSS! can't wait!
you poor thing.
2:02 play in 0x25 speed. One of the killers looks like a male with brown/brunette hair. They are beginning stabbed by one of the main girls.
So glad they didn't just reboot and kept the OG cast in place!
Yeap,  it's time to go back to those days...💀👍😎👍💀
ওই একই কাহিনীরে নতুন মশলা দিয়ে রান্না করা।
This is going to a great epic reunion of all the original characters
Oh please tell me it’s gonna be good    I’m hyped !
This didn’t feel particularly scary.  But I liked Ready or Not, so I’m trusting that they pulled it off well!  I love seeing our OG’s, and I can’t wait!
already got a feeling that dewey is the killer dont know why just vibes
I like how both Sidney and Dewey are more badass in this one. They have been through Soo much shit in the past films. This man has been shot and stabbed multiple times to where I didn't think he'd make it past the 3rd film. And Sidney is annoyed but is packing the heat Lol can't wait to see this movie.
This is a heavy nostalgic rush for us 90s kids and teens. It actually looks good!
“It’s an honor!” Let’s go, can’t wait to see Ghostface on the big screen again! 😎
Neve Campbell looks all natural  Courteney Cox not so much...  Trailer looks good though
Wow.... That looks incredible and so glad his back. Been too long. Fingers crossed it's rated R.
Y'all totally had a chance to call it 5cream. But I'm stoked to see this!
HERE WE GOOOOO
Anyone remember Jenny Ortega from Stuck in The middle????
Oh my goodness, I’m hyped for this
Can't be any worse than 3 or 4 were?......right?
Okay ….. okay…… I’ll give this one a chance. 🤔🤔🤔
YAAWWWWN.  Hollywood:  "Hey, let's keep mining movies from Generation X (especially the 1980's and 1990's), because we're out of ideas!!"  Of course the mindless, video-game/younger generation will consume it.
I’m… so happy rn. 😭✨
Fuckkkk yeahhhh
Okay, I am HYPED! I'll be adding this to my list, right after Ghostbusters: Afterlife.
This is terrible
Wow this is extremely different without Wes Craven. I don't know how I feel about this. Wes is my all time favorite Horror director. I hope you guys don't ruined his work.
I am getting scary movie vibes😂
I love how my glorious horror movies I grew up with are being redone properly.  Evil Dead, Halloween, later tonight Chucky, now scream.   Give my boy Freddy some love next, with Robert Englund please :).
Halloween (2018) Candyman (2021) Scream (2022)   *Whats with all these horror reboots/sequels having the same title as the first movie?* 😂
LFG!!!!!!!
Can't wait!
Clearly, it's a continuation since the original characters are still here. Why not just call it Scream 5? Now it's always going to be Scream (1996) and Scream (2022) which is just obnoxious.
Anyone notice Dewey’s deputy from scream 4 is shown in the trailer
This looks freaking awesome cinema coming January 14th
IM SO READY👻
*"Hello, Sidney. It's an Honor"*  Fuckin Chills.
"Keep your expectations low boy, and you will never be disappointed."
I think the cop from the original scream movie dies
"I'm Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun". SOLD!
Can't wait!!!!!!
I wanna know why Ghostface is still calling landlines 😂😂
"hello sidney"    "hello peter"
If you've seen Saw, Scream, and Squid Game, you know by now if a stranger ever asks you to play a game, you say no.
So is Jenna Ortega the opening kill or is that a red herring? I’m still hoping it’s Selena Gomez.
Looks so shiny and new but underneath is just a obvious rehash. It honestly looks no different than Scream 4.
I'm So Excited Trailer Was So Incredible Can't Wait For The Movie ! 😊
THE horror franchise is back baby
AYEEE I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONEEE. 🥰
HYPED
Neve and Courtney still look gorgeous, and this trailer is pretty damn good, this might just be a great modern take on Scream. Now if only if the Friday and Nightmare franchises could get decent modern films.
“I’m Sydney Prescott…of course I have a gun.”  Gangster line!
The filmmakers better bring it. I’m serious. Wes Craven’s legacy deserves nothing less than one scary/funny/awesome movie
So what's your favorite scary movie?
That's what you get for having a landline in the 2020s lol
I thought Jenna would have a bigger part in this
5CREAM
Kinda seems to be a let down, at least for me
Well it's time to get my scream dvd's out of storage and have screamathon.
I feel like shedding a tear bro this shit gonna be a classic I can feel it 💪🔥🔥
this is story sustainable movie before 😱😱😱😱🔪🔪 long time no see ghostface
I can be completely wrong but the beginning of this trailer is Stews house isn’t it?
I miss Wes Craven directing style, but looks good this chapter five
And nothing feels different about this at all, as Dewey mentioned. I'm disappointed! This looks like a attempt to re-do Scream 4, which kinda failed with the new generation instead of trying to make a real reboot with fresh ideas and kills and story that would be creepy and make us feel like the original Scream did.
I want to scream whasuppp in whatsap
Scream will always be my favorite horror series ever
What's the point
Scream usually have the survivor (aside from the main three) from previous film dies in the next sequel. So the officer from Scream 4 probably will die in this (if she returns, that is) and i suppose Kirby really is dead since shes nowhere in this trailer.
Fucking hilarious
“Sidney it’s happening again”: OH MY F*@$ING GOD 🙄
Would you Settle for a PG 13 relationship?
Why do I have a feeling that Dylan Minette is the killer in this movie? Hmm
WOOHOO!!!!!
This looks so good.
READY🩸🔪
Looks good, but let's be honest, no one is going to call it Scream. It's Scream 5 and that's what we'll call it.
The original Scream is my favorite horror movie of all time. I’m super excited for this new movie.
This year and next year are gonna be awesome Halloween Kills  Chucky Series  Scream  Halloween Ends  IM SO EXCITED
But will Kirby come back?
Buzzing 🐝 Roll on January!!!
Its my favorite movie and texas chainsaw massacre
It looks unrell can't wait  and the cast is back 👻
oooo daddy, i'm scared
Everyone please just call this movie Scream 5.
OMG
*incoherent screeching*
Dead by Daylight 🔥
This reboot is going to be the best one yet!!!!!!
So ya this is a day one go to fucking scream babyyyyyyyy
Special officer doofy reporting for duty!
I love reading the comment section. The Scream fanbase is alive and well, baby!
The Big 3 better survive this film
“It fells deferent” because wes craven died it will be deferent no matter what.
"what's your favorite scary movie" 👻👻👻👻🔪🔪🔪
Halloween Kills and now Scream. This genre of horror making a comeback💪❤️
yeah . for the old times
Oh my god 🥰🥰🥰🥰💥💥💥
!!!!
Why just call it Scream if it’s not a remake? What’s wrong with Scream: Resurrection or Scream: Retribution? Or Scream: Scream Harder?
Super underrated movie! Can't wait! Hopefully it's not her sister 2nd cousins grandma's ex-husband dog sitter who's also their lost step brother... .-.
I'm very sceptical... looks like a generic remake instead of a sequel without anything that made Scream great (the meta gags, the creative plot).
The iconic movie is back cant wait till January 14
Can anyone tell me if this is adjacent to the scream series?
high hopes are brewing for this one
Yasssssss
People forget the original Scream was released in 1996. I was 4 at the time. This is definitely our generations Halloween.
Doc Ock: Hello Peter. Ghost Face: Hello Sidney.
Woooo! That looks great
Awesome kills, some thrills, the comedy from our OG 3 being back at it again, and another visit from ghostface with a modern twist, I'm excited!
W
LFGGG
“I’m Sidney Prescott! Of course I have a gun!” “Hello Sidney. It’s an honor!” Scream 2022 is here and our final girl Sid is back!!!! Sid is my favorite all time final girl cuz she never took shit from killers since the first movie and always threw hands. She’s a fighter and a survivor!!! ❤️
oh shit this looks amazing
Looks disappointing  In the first film there was something else that caused excitement, something that no one can recreate
Ghostface paying homage to jigsaw 🥺😍 my heart
Stu is the killer  Calling it
They're seriously going with the Halloween 2018 style? ☠️
What kind of weird Michael Myers is this?
Esta saga de película la están reviviendo de nuevo espero que siga teniendo ese toque que tenían las antecesoras😊🔥💯💫💎
Damn, I’m hoping for modern reboot jokes, but this looks pretty dark still
More fire!!!!
Ghostface will likely be a new character introduced in this film, but wouldn't it be a great twist if it was actually either Gale or Dewey (or even both)? All the trauma they have witnessed/been subjected to could cause the mind of either of them to just snap and go on a rampage of their own. Plus, it would continue to reinforce how Sidney can't trust anyone, not even those who've been with her since the very beginning.
I hope stu and Billy return and come out in the second trailer
my favorite scary movie
One of the best things about the Scream movies is their ability to keep you guessing.  Every time something happens, anything, it's a clue and you KNOW who the killer is.  You're certain.  Your gut tells you, he's the one, she's the one.  But guess what, you're wrong.  The writers lay out such meticulous "clues" for us to pick up, and then lead us down a totally different path.  For that I LOVE these movies, and I love seeing all the guesses already about who Ghostface is this time.  Guess what, you're probably wrong!  :)
i don't care.... im calling it: 5cream
Sidney Prescott, victim turned warrior. Right up there with Sara Connor and Laurie Strode.
Never did see Matthew Lillard truly die in the first one did we :)
Hell yea boiii. Im hoping with halloween franchise making a come back and now scream that friday the 13th and also nightmare on elm street also come back
Something tells me and it feels like Stu is behind that mask but we’ll see
If all the new victims are related to the past killers, then maybe the new killer is related to a past victim? Revenge by proxy?
Zzzz
We all know the beginning is deff the rebooted Stab movie also known as Stab 10. :D
I better not die before this movie releases...I'll be pretty pissed off
Literally cannot wait for the film! My favourite horror films of all time 🔪
Our favourite killer is back motherlovers.
This looks void of any charisma beyond "I have seen these characters and the costume before."  Studios dumping their bad movies in January has a tradition. Hopes are not high.
Let's fokin goooo
I'm just sitting here like "damn, someone still has a landline?". And I love how they actually have to make mention of it being a landline which I bet is for the newest generation which would be all like "why does that phone have a weird cord hooked up to it" lol
Came for the neck, who next?
Let’s FN Gooooo  Hoping my Girl Tara pulls through
Ghost face is an original character from the first movie. Calling it right now.
Hopefully this isnt extremely woke
-How many times are you gonna watch this trailer?  Me: YES.
I can't wait to find out who ghostface is in this movie.
1:03: best line!  I wish Elisha Cuthbert had been in this movie...
Yeahh
Trailer looks good, but fire whoever titled the film. There's already a "Scream," and this ain't it...
HELL YEAH!!!!! IM SO FREAKING PUMPED!!!!!! HELLOOOOO SIDNEY!!!!!
Looks stupid
"I'm Sidney Presscot. Ofcours I have a gun", only one sentence but that sentence will be forever iconic.
On my birthday.. I can’t wait!
Absolutely no way Dewey makes it out this time and I’m not ready for that.
Waiting for citizen z trailer breakdown!!! ❤️
It looks like they are bringing Scream into a new realm and it looks like they may have just got it right.. I'm excited to see this.
Hello Sidney it's an honor 👀👀👀 someone from her past or someone who knows her story.
“Hello Sidney it’s an honor” was so dope!!!! Can’t wait!
Missed opportunity to make last letter red in the middle.
I wish Cary Fukunaga would direct the next sequel to Scream.
Head are gonna roll tonight Sidney!!!!! Finally!!!
January?
SCREAM 5 ITS HERE
So HERE  is my commentary. Sidney ISNT the opening scene and she doesn't appear until perhaps the middle of the of the movie ( 3 attack so far ) They don't seem to have anything new with this one which is a continuation of Scream 4 and this apparently looks like a " Scream 4 redue " to attempt a new franchise. The NEW FRANCHISE needs to KILL Dewey, gale and  Sidney or isn't a NEW FRANCHISE at all..You cant have it both ways. .No one will ever acknowledge a new franchise if you keep bringing back the same characters now, close to their damn 60`s! Kill them OFF and MOVE ON! Its just not working guys..10 years later and yet ANOTHER killer emerges and FOR? WHY another 10 years? STUPID AF ----And what do you mean " Return to Woodsboro "  THEY ALREADY DID THAT I SCREAM 4. This looks like garbage and i don't feel like anything is new or different. I will say this again, this is not SCREAM OR SCREAM 5 this is nothing but an attempt to  REMAKE SCREAM 4 ( which sucked )
Im literally obsessed 😍
What if….. What if Selena Gomez is the killer. It would be a huge mindblower.
Shit! Anyone else get chills cuz the voice and the whole trailer!? Its fucking wild!
I hope this reboot is good, but it looks like its going to be just ok. 1996 Scream is a certified classic.
The past always come back to bite you in the a**!!!!!!!! 😂🤟🏾
At least we know Sidney won't die in te first scene. 🙏🙏🙏
Calling it now Stu Macher is the killer
cause let's face it, baby, these days ya gotta have a sequel!
The best
"Something about this one just feels different."  *not directed by Wes Craven  Me: Yeah, you can say that again.
Looks like Dewey will actually die in this one, super sad. I was hoping if one had to die that it would have been Gail. 😢
Just put the 5.
I'm gonna watch all of those previous parts again before this one hits the theatre. I'm hyped...
SCREAM is my favorite film and franchise, and this looks SO GOOD!
WELL I AM WAITING FOR THE SCARY MOVIE 😂😂  "WHATzaaaaaa"
Where kirby she was alove and sidney adopted her and she suppose to be playing in thos scream and who the killer now and we still have mickey from scream 2 never died and stu from scream 1 never died
LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾🤟🏾 GHOSTFACE 👻
Never been a huge fan of this franchise but this movie seems AWESOME
So we got Michael Myers coming back and now Ghostface now we're just waiting on Freddy and Jason lol
From the looks of this… Jenna Ortega is about to be Drew Barrymored 😳
Can’t wait 😭
I waited months for this moment 😤
Why just "Scream?"  Shouldn't it be, like, Scream 5 or something?
YASSSSSSSS SLAYED THE HOUSE BOOTS DOWN HOUSTON
It’s really awesome! I’m so happy
I won't sleep until he's in the ground! Sydney Prescott channeling her spirit animal, Laurie Strode!
So wait, is this the 5th one or reboot?
Looks F'in awesome!!! That's how you reboot a franchise
Speaking of which, what are the other rules for a direct sequel to slasher film? The only one i know is that "not even the OG characters are safe from being killed"
AAARGH... THIS TRAILER LOOKS, SAVAGE!! Gosh, I still remember how Ghostface haunted my nights when I was a kid and dang, I can't wait for this movie already. Sidney looks more badass than in the last movie and I can legit feel the crazy plot tension!  And Ghostface saying, "Hello Sidney. It's an honor."  I can't stop feeling nostalgic. AAH, someone get me a casket already!! 😭😭😭
Oooh can't wait to see this
Who still has house phones ?
I’m gonna be so mad if they kill off Dewey for shock value! He needs to live through out the series
First day there!! 😁
YES, i’ve been waiting 8 years for this!!!!
Everything about this trailer has me more hyped than I was. 😭😭😭🔪🔪🔪
I'm calling it now: Sidney will be the killer in this one. It's the biggest plot twist that could happen, and look at the tagline . . .
Hell yeah
I could not give more of less of a crap about this movie
I freaking hate the fact that Tara is the first kill. Love Jenna Ortega
Me thinking it's a spinoff with an entire new cast: 😐😐😐 Me seeing all the OG actors reprise their roles AGAIN: 😯😯😯😯😯
Why do I get the feeling doughie is the killer this time. The stature of the killer almost matches doughie’s posture but of course this is scream so an accomplice is expected. Nice to see jack quaid from the boys in this, he needs to call billy the butcher lol. Also love seeing all the helpless pretty teenage victims who will be picked off one by one. If they can match the originality of the first film, provide a fresh story behind the killers motivations then this should be good.
Dead by daylight mori I better see in this 😂
Full glass patio doors.  Panic about electronic bolt locks.
Same shit, different day
This is about to be iconic😭😭
I don’t think this is a soft reboot like we all though. The killer is going at the og cast for their past while pursuing a new era…in my opinion it’s a continuation of the franchise AND IM HERE FOR IT
I love how Jenna’s character sees the unknown name calling and just declines the call. I find that really funny
This seems more darker than the previous ones. Probably Wes Craven no longer involved. An he's always adding some comic relief to his movies. RIP Wes Craven
Anyone clock 2:00 minutes lol I think there's a major plot spoiler, either that or Gail has had another cameraman die on her 😂 sorry duey your out 😱
I spotted Stu's house!!!
This movie is gonna be awesome 👏 hurry up, January!!
Where is the number 5 on the poster and end card
I honestly can't wait!!
So following theme of referencing horror movie tropes what is it referring to? Soft-reboots? Because scream 4 was directly acknowleding emakes
JANUARY HURRY UP AND GET HERE😩
SCREAM TRAILER ON MY BIRTHDAY!!! SUCH A COOL PRESENT
Lesssssssss goooooooooo
Surprise Sydney!
Seriously?! Good Lord...Hard pass.
Dewey cant die man he is cool character
WOW
👻 helloo
"What would be your motive?"
I think Dylan Minnettes character will be scream cause he’s third in the cast list next to Jenna and he was shown least in the trailer.
I really hope there's a lot of kills and surprises not shown in this trailer. Also not releasing it in theaters with the 25th anniversary was a huge marketing blunder. Don't be like the Weinsteins.
trash
They legit killed Ortega at the beginning lol
If Sydney dies we riot
"Hello Sidney, Its an honor" gave me chills, I do hope though its 2 killers instead of one like Scream 3, this is SCREAM 5 no way call it Scream please, Ghostface looks bad ass!!! Cant wait comes out a week after my birthday, OH YEAH!!!
That shot of Gale screaming really makes it seem like Dewey won't make it.
This could be a good way to start 2022 with a bang. Also since it's coming out close to my 30th birthday I think this is a proper way to celebrate it.
It’s good to see it modernized. Trailer looks door though! 5cream😌🤔 I think they should’ve don’t that with the title
YESSSSSS IM A SCREAM FANATIC ‼‼‼
where's oprah?
Yay
Me after this trailer:  WHAASAAAAAAAAAAPPPPPP
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
Talk about spoilers.  . . . . . . . . . . It was clear who from the OG cast gets killed
How about Friday the 13th?
“Would you like to play a game?” When Ghostface becomes Jigsaw.
Wow this looks so promising!!
WAZZUUUUUUPPPPP
VERY NICE!!!! Wes Craven would be Proud!
I’m interested but I don’t have high expectations for this movie  It’s a January horror movie !!!! Ughhh
Let's go
Let’s get it ghost face returns 👻
Writing this comment on 13 Oct at 12:22 a.m
should have called "stab" instead
Sidney and Laurie still kicking ass and getting the praise they deserve from a generation that wasn't even born when these ladies started kicking ass makes me very excited and emotional.
Let’s go! Scream 2021
YES
Cool
SOO HYPED
This looks really good !
WAAAAZZZZUUUUPPPPPPPP
Plot twist: the killer is Sidney and a hired hand. She heard someone was going to start killing again and decided to just end all possible family lines to stop it.
Cheaaa let’s get it
IT LOOKS AMAZING!!!!!!!! 🔥😍👉🏼🔪
25 years later.....damn im so old
They should have named it "Whimper". The reboot nobody wanted.
I think this movie is gonna be the scariest movie they ever did
Everybody better wear depend diapers because you’re gonna need them it’s gonna scare the shit out of everybody 😂🤣
Awesome I can’t wait!
Oh it’s Forsure Dylan Minnette
I’m nervous cause “FUCK YOU, ITS JANUARY!!!!!!!”
Omg! 💗💗💗💗💗
Yo you have NO IDEA HOW EXCITED I AM RN AAAHHH!! Also, the new Chucky series drops today?! Is this real life?! 🤩
The one where Sidney's the killer ;)
Feeling a little woozy here
Now this, is something i look forward to. Thank you for going back to the roots.
I came here for the "Hello Sidney"...
THE ONLY HORROR FRANCHISE WORTH FOLLOWING!! PERIOD!! SOOOO READY FOR THIS!!
They couldn't call it Scream 5?
SCREAM 5!!!!!
I think one of the OG's has to die. I'm thinking Dewey or Gale, either way I feel like they can't all survive again
Anyone else in love with the Scream Franchise… besides Scream 2
Did anyone get the mega chills when he said “ Hello Sidney it’s an honor” cuz I did 😝😝
The smart locks. It's so interesting to watch technology evolve and how it is used in slasher films.
Dammit a fckng goosebumps 😫
they should kill all the og cast right in the beginning shit would be scary sick
Can’t fuckin wait
1:04 Shannon Watts is preparing a boycott somewhere.
He has a knife. They have guns. Movie over.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
SCREAM IS ALIVE MOTHERFUCKERS! YEAASS!
Didn't like it, AT ALL!
Kind of feels like Halloween (newest) at home. BRING BACK Stumaker!
the fact that the movie crew are not aware of the ending yet is legit. they shot 5 endings. i am so ready for scream 5
Today: “January?! Why not Friday?” Jan 14: “OMG I forgot to get tickets!”
Isn't this an advert to just get Ring.
Well deserved to make another film hope they don’t butcher it! ! 😩
Hey yo pick up the phone  Wazzzzaaa 🤣
YEEEEEEEEESSS! I LOVE FAN SERVICE!!!!!!!
That's cool, seems like a Halloween 2018 style reboot and I'm so down
"Hello Sydney, Remember me, It's showtime!"
OMFGGGGGG MY HEART CANT HANDLE ALL THIS HYPE!
1:21 This is a woman
Michael was better that's just me👌
They gave away a lot in this trailer! I would’ve teased instead of going so much into details. Samantha is totes the killer, and/or one of the killers. Tara is her sister, so she obviously had access to unlock the doors, she’s looking hella evil at the end of the trailer and stabbing what seems to be Sidney or Gale. Also the person being burnt is in Stu kitchen and appears to be a woman (you can see Sidney watching them burn), which would mean that she’s probably the daughter on Stu and we didn’t know he had a child until now, probably actually Taras adopted sister. I’m like 99.9% on Samantha is at least one of the murders. If that’s the case, I’ll be a low key disappointment that they revealed that much.
Oh my God damn I saw the screen 5 movies this movie is in amazing I saw that it was freaking cool 🔪 👻
Did they just ruin the opening kill sequence? Too much given away in this trailer. Also, Ghostface doesn't sound the same. Still gonna watch cos Scream is my favourite franchise but just initial opinions bases on an initial viewing.
Sponsored by Samsung.
DaBaby: " LETSSSSSSSSSSSS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
Me gusta si también viniste por Melissa Barrera
"Hello Sidney,its an honor" AS IT SHOULD
YESSSSSSS
I'M SO EXCITED FOR THIS!!! scream is one of my favorite movies of all time and I'm so excited for it to be coming back! Also: that first kill is a fakeout first kill I think, I'm pretty sure the first kill will be Judy Hicks
I've watched this trailer at least six times already I'm so excited for this!
Fun fact: Joaquin Phoenix was offered the role of Billy in the first Scream and turned it down.
Is Gale going to interact with Ghostface? She not really doing anything. Vince, Tara, Mindy, Amber(screaming), Chad, Sam, Richie, Judy and Dewey all seem like to be victims to Ghostface in the trailer so far.
Simple. Don't let him stalk you, and tea bag him at the exit gate.
Older movies are coming back!!! Can’t wait for more of them like Indian Jones 5, Ghostbusters, Jurassic 6,
Mistake. in the opening scene, jenna ortega’s character didn’t get herself a knife when she was in the kitchen and then she gets one when ghost face attacked her.
Are you fricking kidding me?
I can’t wait!
He sounds like Jigsaw
Imagine being the opening kill lul
I'm surprised by the fact homegirl still has a landline 🤯
C'mon ghostface, WE ARE READY! 😎🇧🇷
Why did Jenna have to die
Something here feels way more intense and darker than the past Scream movies, I really hope the comedy is on par and the kills are creative, did I see a character on fire? 🔪 (UPDATE) 01/13/2022 -- (Spoiler Free: HOLY F* F**KIN S**T! WATCH THIS IF YOU CAN!. Brutal, brilliant, and beautiful. The Slasher Genre is back. I was seriously impressed with this film, of course it could always be better, but really, I loved it.)
Idk but… why does it look so cheap, as if it’s a 1987 year movie, and such a bad acting. Wtf
Oh no cindy Brendaaaa
Calling it rn, saying Stu is the killer. Somehow someway 😂
So we're just making spinoffs of classic horror/ slasher movies where the survivors hunt the horror icons in a future timeline. Awesome! Can't wait!!
Here we go again 🔪🍷 5CREAM
"cause let's face it, baby, these days ya gotta have a sequel!"
I'm surprised they didn't update his costume but hey, sometimes you gotta stick with the classics
WE BACK BOYSSSSS!!!!
Finally a new scream movie yesssss
I was about to be a negative Nancy until I see the original characters... I like how they're merging their stories. I will be looking forward to watching this!
OMG SHES BACK AT THE ORIGINAL HOUSE! 1:56
I am almost willing to bet they'll make the killer a woman to try to be "different" I am almost certain that the killer will most likely be one of the women
Please let it be mathew lillard
A killer killing people related to the original killers? Definitely a super fan of Sidney Prescott, or the abandoned love child of her and Billy Loomis. My guess is it’s Deputy Judy’s son, Wes.
odd release date
Why is there no number in the title? Its clearly NOT a reboot since it continues the story.
Shame Wes craven  is dead
A bit gimmicky… what are they doing to Wes’ creation?
This movie wouldn't exist if the lead character was living in the south and a conservative. She would have just went to the gun room, grabbed an AR and laid waste to ghost face. Our women know how to handle themselves.
I can't wait for this
OMG!!!!! Finallllly 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m Sidney Prescott. Of course I have a gun!
WHY IS JENA ORTEGA DYING ????
Looks mediocre… I’m excited lol
Best movie since Free Guy
OMG! I've been anticipating this movie for a while year! You all nailed it! This is one of my favorite franchises of all time. I'm glad you all didn't spoil anything and did it in true Scream fashion! 😱😱😭😭😭
Here we go again
Tara is definitely screwed 😬
I really thought Jenna Ortega was going to be a survival girl 😔 She has the media presence, following and ability to stick around for years. However, her opening scene had me feeling EVERYTHING!! "OH PLEASE GOD!"
Halloween premieres in just a couple of weeks and Scream in January. I can't wait! :')
Looks as great as the original. And that's not something that happens too often.
Imagine if it was Stu. That would be crazy
I’ll be right back wasawwwa
im so excited
Okay. Good sign bad sign time.  It's not a reboot. Good sign.  Its dropping in January (on my birthday in fact). Bad sign.  Writing seems on point. Good sign.  First Scream movie without Wes. Bad sign.  They didn't try to redesign ghostface. Good sign.  They really made it look like Dewey is probably dead this time. Bad sign.  The original trio is back. Good sign.  They're putting a lot of focus on a new, younger girl, which lowers Sydney's chances of survival significantly. Were Wes behind the wheel here, I'd trust that she was actually ghostface this time. But this isn't Wes so... Bad sign.  It looks good. Very good in fact, but temper your expectations people, there are many decisions that could make this a MASSIVE disappointment.
So you telling me the killer ain’t going after Sidney
OHHHHH YES.......................
FUCK YEA IM ALL THE WAY IN so happy you brought back the surviving crew (hope they don't die)
Why can't they call this Scream 5?
Good trailer
Damn that actually looked kind of good.
Too bad Randy isn't alive. I wonder what he would say about this film, being the fifth one and all. I love it when he called out the tropes and genre cliches.
Holy s***!!...ok I have some work to do...then I'm coming back to watch this again!!...ILL BE RIGHT BACK!!!!
Holy shit!! This one looks badass. Scream is my favorite franchise, including the tv series so LITERALLY can't wait!!
1:25  Clay Jensen
I was here.
IT HAS TO BE STU PLEEASSEEEE
This was so dope. Can’t wait
So a tiny girl was able to push the door closed on a full grown man?
Looks trash tbh
I like how it’s titled “Scream” only because it makes me forget about Scream 4 even more! Can’t wait for this!
"Something about this one just feels different" Yeah bc it's on Paramount pictures this time around 😂🤣😭
What if Stu is the killer
Ahaha he's back
O my gooooooood i love sidney
is this ghostface will tea bag
Wait is that Kirby ??????
Is that blond actor from Don't Breathe?
Hollywood has seriously lost their damn mind. What a load of unoriginal trash which is typical of the unapologetically unoriginal, straw grasping culture of the movie biz. Are there no new ideas or is everything just a damn reboot or cgi loaded franchise pandering to Chinese audiences? Let’s just reboot everything because audiences dgaf, this is what they think.
Another woke trash movie that racewashed a character.
Not a great trailer. Could have been a lot shorter, less given away
I fell in love with horror movies in  1996 because of Scream I was only ten lol 😆 I would love to see Sidney as the killer 👀😉
CHILLS GOD DAMN THIS LOOKS GOOD
BOOORING!
I grew up watching these movies, sadly I was only a few weeks old when the first one came out. Luckily I was able to watch the 25th anniversary in theaters. This looks amazing & looks even better than 4 😬
OMGGG YESSS
FINALLY
Judy hixx better not die
Who even has a telephone nowadays.
Damn it! It's here again!!! ❤️😍
shoulda called it "iScream"
Who else is gonna watch all the Scream movies before they go to see this one?
Oh hell yeah WTF it's already been 10 years since the last  Scream 4 movie back in 2011
1:39 Hughie?
What's a landline?
Looks better than Scream 4 tho
we love comedy scary movie, not the real scary...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I rather take 10 scream movies over 10 fast and furious movies lol lets goooo
Holy hell, finally! Michael Myers is making his return and now a new(?) Ghostface emerges!
Ok. Im hyped up to see this now!!!!
I've been through this...a lot
5cream!
I think Dewey dies in this one. He looks like he became an alcoholic and no longer with Gail. The fear/terror on gails  face in one of the scenes…RIP Dewey
YYEEAHHH
I bet the killer is boy-band Clay Jensen
It’s like they just don’t know how to make a scary movie anymore…..   This is cringe
🔥🔥🔥
I freaking love it honest to god I love it Ghostface deserves this.
omgg
Would have been way better if he'd come out for its 25th anniversary in December but at least it'll be a great start to the year I guess.
Arguably the GOAT movie franchise! I sincerely pray they didn't go woke and ruin it!
Isnt SCREAM supposed to be a more comedic/funny horror movie?
Don’t get smart doors.  And shut off the wifi
Incredible first look
Not bad, not bad at all!!! “I’m Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun”
I can't wait to watch this, just hope the young cast who'll probs have majority screen time aren't the woke kind
Any killer predictions just from watching the trailer? I keep hearing a theory that Stu from the first scream might be the killer
At this point Neve and Jamie Lee Curtis need to be fired from killing villains.
I swear if they kill Dewey
Hell fucking yea 👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿🤪😜😝😝🤪………… cant wait
I'm ready
5CREAM
The acting of that first actress is fucking hilarious
GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I’m dying! I can’t wait, this is going to be incredible
R.I.P. Wes Craven. January is the Recycle Bin of Hollywood so this movie will most likely have less than 60% on Rotten Tomatoes
Lmao, who tf has a landline in 2021?
Me: "New Scream movie? Eh, probably not the same without Wes."  *Sees trailer*  "Holy fucking shit, can't wait to see this!"  RIP Wes Craven
the "Halo SYDNEY!!!???", thrilling the fuck out 👌👌
By the look of where Dewey is staying him and gale is divorced right?
I.....Am.....So..... Excited! There are no words to express my sheer happiness, joy, and excitement right now!
Hello Sydney .....
Bro, what a coincidence - I literally just finished watching the last four films today.
Sidney, Gale, and Dewey when there’s a new killer. “Well imagine how tired we are”
Atleast the LGBTQ+ community is safe from Ghostface 💁🏽‍♂️If he tries to kill one of them he’ll get cancelled💯
Woke scream..great. All boxes ticked..needlessly.
Oh its been a long time
This feels very fresh ! And dark I love it !! Also the opening made me jump lol so excited for this !! Just annoyed it showed too much ! But got super happy to see the OGs !! Sidney is so iconic ! Best final girl so that line at the end gave me chills !
WHOO!!!!  That’s one hell of a trailer, the intro specifically as it totally gets the blood pumping. If Michael Myers is savage, Ghostface has become more smarter and colder than ever!!! October this year has more to offer apparently.
I was right about Jenna dying
Omg
Let's face it.. Your mother was no Sharon Stone.
Did I see Lisa Kudrow? Are we getting a mini friends reunion where she'll probably end up dead
This felt like it’s bringing the franchise back to its roots while also making it feel waaaaayyyy more scary and intense! Can’t wait! “I’ll be right back!”
FUCK YES!!
The first bit might not be the opener.
One word: DAAAAAAAAAMN
It sucks Jenna ortegas the first kill
January...y’all really trying to make this movie fail huh? Wtf💀😂
W Trailer
I can't wait to see Sidney kick Ghostface ass!
Kind of taking a Halloween 2018 vibe. Looks good.
Wow this looks cool and darker that previous films.
My dream...😍😍😍Sidney Prescott!!!🙏🙏🙏🙏
When he broke the leg, ewww, brutal, maybe they'll go the new Halloween in terms of brutallity.
Could they called this one part 5 not to call part 1 new remake?
this actually looks good
I’m glad that it’s just straight into it. The “I’m Sidney Prescott of course I have a gun” like yes let’s go. Samantha is very sketchy. Why why why did they do Jenna Ortega like that guess she’s the new Drew Berrymore.
If the killer ends up being Clay Jensen, I’m creating my own mixtape.
The only reason i'm watching this next year is because of the original cast. Why they need to upgrade movies to fit with todays technology? Just look at Child's Play (2019) smh
who else hopes stu makes a comeback??
-Alone in hospital. -Gun empty. -Shot of Ghost Face trying to stab him. -Shot of Ghost Face potentially following a wounded victim along the ground of the hospital. -Dewey shown on the ground in the hospital. -Dewey is not with Sydney or Gale for the majority of shots the originals are shown together.  I hate to say it, but Dewey isn’t looking too safe lol
Now will it be worthy of the franchise only time shall see.
Wow… This looks really bad.
knowing Arquette is doing wrestling now, he might do a "heel turn" and actually be the villain here... I HOPE SO
this looks so good I hope the new characters are interesting my main problem with Scream 4 was that I didn't really know what the new characters were like so I didn't really care about them well except for Kirby but this movie looks like a nice balance between the original three and the new characters
Sidney is seriously the strongest final girl of all time
The fact that Jenna Ortega’s character is (most likely) the opening kill is sad when she could have carried the entire film 🥲
To me Scream and Halloween to me are the best slasher films. I grew up watching them.
Okay so like where tf is Kirby?!?
THATS STUS HOUSE.
David Arcat.. WASSSSUUPPP!!!
Not really into it
"Hello Peter" is nothing close to a "Hello Sidney".     GHOSTFACE IS BACK, FELLAS
Who has a landline in 2021?
Paramount Pictures 😱
I CANT WAIT
Fuck yeah!!!!
If Jenna dies in the beginning ima cry bro
LFG Bay Bay
It would be hilarious if after ghost face says he/she wants to play a game, the character on the other line says “yeah, I have candy land or monopoly.” And then ghost face says “oh, candy land for sure.” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
this shit looks gnarly!!!!
Yes, please.                  ..............and thank you.
let's hope this one doesn't tbag that much
I think the killer is Sam and Wes, and I have a feeling that they are both older than everyone else in the cast about 25 years old and that Sam trys to kill her sister and everyone connected to the first film when she learns she was adopted by the Carpenter family when Sydney secretly adopted her love child to Billy Loomis which she gave up for adoption between Scream 1996 and Scream 2 1997 this being Sam....I also believe that Dylan Minnette is Judy Hicks and Stu Machers secret love child - both of these children conceived at Stus House party in the original Scream both of whom have learnt the lies to their true identities and both who plot together and want revenge on Woodboro and those involved.
Why isn't it called scream 6?
Wow that looked Horrible. No recognizable A-List faces (except for those original 3 actors which we're sick of seeing). Like honestly..how many times are you going to put Sidney Dewey and Gale through this. They literally look tired. No iconic scream music or sounds. You practically showed everybody about to be killed. It looks like theres no Wes Craven style tongue in cheek COMICAL RELIEF which is iconic to the Scream Franchise. The worst part about it is that you didnt cast any new and popular actors. Definitly shoulda called some of the actors from Stranger Things, Euphoria, IT, Grown-ish, Gossip Girl, etc. I predict a box office fail. I'll check back in a month after the release LOL
2:00 bet Dewey has gone bye bye
Wow 😯
🔥🔥🔥
I think it’s gonna be Stu . They already somewhat confirmed that he didn’t die in the first movie . Or since this is a reboot , it would be cool if he’s the one pulling the strings and making others kill for him .
Fuck... the trailer looks good but I have such mixed reactions right now. I have no idea why.
I like how Scream turn into a Chucky 2019 with all the tech we got... I'm not saying this one will be shit like Child's play but idk I'll give it a try.
AYO IS THAT PHIN FROM SPIDER MAN: MILES MORALES?????? 1:22
MEU DEUS ISSO AQUI
It looks so amazing!!!
I'M SO EXCITED
Damn Jenna Ortega was the whole reason I wanted to watch this lol
Who still has a landline??!!
A 90's kid will never gonna miss this.
YASSS, THIS ALREADY MY 🆕 FAVORITE ENTRY !!! THE ACTING IN THE OPENING, SUPERB, OKAY 👌🏽🙅🏽😆😍🏆
Fuck yes!!!
Hype is biiiiig!!!!!
It’s dylan
Scary movie making in progress!!
Ah fuck....Dewey is definitely going to be the legacy kill. Wish they didn't show CC welping like that in the trailer.
Scream is my favorite I can't wait for this one! And with how hilarious Ready or Not was I have complete faith in Radio Silence definitely seems based off this short amount that they're staying faithful to what Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson created.
im so hype
Sidney Prescott has a gun and Laurie strode shotgun!   These ladies are prepared this time! Lol
What are the fucking chances!? 😂 sat down and decided I wanted to rewatch all the scream movies again and then i find out that by some miracle TODAY only 2 hours ago a new movie is announced. I’m so god damn happy and hyped for this! Letss gooo
The only way they can make this one unpredictable is if the killer is either one of the main characters (wich would suck) or a return of an old one that somehow survived.  We've had the boyfriend and his mother, the brother, the cousin... I wonder how will they make this one stand out and not recycle plots...
Can’t wait! I’ve been thinking about this for a days now and this may seem obscure, but ghost could end up being Gale because she’s been trying to write and release a new book but none of the publishers chose not work with her. The other person I’m thinking that could be ghost face is Sidney’s father. Maybe he’s been working with Billy, Stu, Mrs. Loomis, and Roman and with his wife’s wild behavior could have finally ignited the firecracker. I doubt any of that happens but introducing a whole new killer with no connection with the main cast could ruin the new movie.
I've watched this 10 times.
Can’t wait!!!!! 🔪
This looks good.
I'M SCREAMING THIS FRANCHISE IS MY LIIIFFFEEEE 💳💥💥💥💳💳💳💳💥💥
Ghost face is back👻👻😱
They keep saying in the movie that the killer is someone they know, so I'm beginning to think the killer is a random person who is an actual serial killer
Getting SCREAM 1 feels 🔥👏🏽 make Wes Craven proud 🥺
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Well there's somthing to be happy about 2022
January!! If only there were an entire period of time in our culture, where people wanted to be scared, and seek out horror movies......if there were such an annual event, you'd think that would be the time to release this.
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
Let me guess Matthew Lillard is back 💀
Please BE GOOD
Sure .. show us all the fucking murders in the film.🙄🙄🙄🙄
This will be the first time I get to see Sream at the theatres. I'm beyond excited!!!!!
Give me all the cheese you got. I'm ready!
i just have 1 qeustion, why did she open the door at the begining
The only thing that unrealistic is its 2021 nobody has a home line anymore that's like a fact
WHOOOOO IM HYPED!
I don't like the way Gale is screaming 😱 third time is the charm for Dewey?
James better get ready.
They basically showed us the entire opening scene, but I have a feeling Jenna doesn’t die
Les goooooooooo
I'm kinda interested... But after the letdown of Scream 4, I'm just not as hyped.
Stop making these movies! Can we get some new movie ideas?
Flowing Halloween huh? Regardless.. I'm Excited.
wazzuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup
A useless remake ?? Why ?? Money ??
I kinda want to see that movie.
I’m a little upset Jenna Ortega is this movie’s “Drew Barrymore” but omg I’m sooo pumped for this movie?
Eh
Dewey's not even being goofy as usual. You just KNOW he's over this shit lmao
i just finished all the SCREAM Movies  TILL NOW (Yesterday) for THIS ONE!!!
So GHOSTFACE is gonna kill the diversity club.  HELL YEAH!!! I'm in.
There we go
It's so great to see slasher movies back in theaters and TV. Halloween, scream, candyman, chucky series, Texas chainsaw massacre in the works. Give us Jason and Freddy too!
Welp, looks like James isn't done covering this series.
A hideous spoilerific trailer - Mason Gooding clearly dies and then you show him in the trailer sitting on a couch.  A. You reduce the killer list well in advance of the movie B. Spoils any suspense.  Now I could be wrong and this is all misdirect but way too many kill scenes in the trailer and every key beat of the opening looks completely spoiled.
So basically, Halloween and Hush in 1?
WAAAAASSSUUUUUUUUP!?
So excited
Let’s go!! Let’s fking go!
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️
Okay this better not be a hype cause it actually looks good .-. A lot of these movies have been doing that shit, look good in the trailer but then end up being shit, giving this a chance
I can't wait for the new scream movie it looks so good
YAWN
Its nice to see the original trio back in action
182K views in 2 hours?! Yesss that's way more than I thought!
not jenna
EVERYBODY IS A SUSPECT! Let’s fucking go!
"Hello Sidney... it's an honor"  They stopped to praise her before they attempted to kill her! This would only happen to Sidney THEE Prescott. Put some respect on her name!
Now THAT’S how you make a sequel!
Fuck yes!!! Can’t fucking wait!!!
who is it now Sydney's XXX boyfriend smh
My man ghostface is back!!!!!!!
Holy shit
Kinda upset Jenna Ortega is the Casey Becker but it looks really good
WAZAAAAAAAAAAAAP!
OMGGG
Awesome I can’t wait
Everyone is a badass now!! I’m excited this is so awesome i love this franchise I just saw the original 1996 scream in theaters the other day for the 25th anniversary
"It's an honor, Sidney."  This just shows how badass Sidney is. Can't want for this movie to be released, it's gonna be awesome! Got strong hopes for this one.
"HELLO SIDNEY...ITS A HONOR"
Damn, that's a whole lot of stuff down in that trailer. Should have been trimmed down and not spoil everything! Still looks good! Rooting for Neve as always, everyone else can die....except Dewey!
All the old cast members aged really good!
This series is beyond special to me. It’s literally been a staple in my life since I was just a baby! Thank you for giving us a new entry! This means the world
Oh look there's Hughie, better be nice to him or you know Billy Butcher is coming for you.
ngl coulda been a bit more dbd with the outfit but fair ig
when i saw the house from the original movie in 1996 i got chills… what if Stu is the killer
IS IT JANUARY YET?! 😭😩😩
Like a good old friend...
SO ICONIC!!! GHOST FACE LOOKS SO SICK!!!
This looks good
Killing or making Ghostface one of the 3 main characters you delete Wes Craven job.
LETS GO BABY
Let’s get this!!!!
Hello Sidney
YEESSSSSSSSSSSSS. LETSSSS GOOOOOO
WHERE’S THE “5” IN THAT TITLE? Seriously, it’s driving me nuts, lol. People talk about maybe the “M” is meant to form a Roman numeral “V” - but NO. The “M” always looked like that, throughout all five films now. Besides, this franchise never ever used Roman numerals before, they’ve always gone with straight up normal looking numbers. So WHY is this one simply called “SCREAM”, when it’s straight up a direct sequel, even having it somehow connect to the first film, it would seem? Why didn’t they make the “S” a “5”?.. Because it’s stupid? Lol, not any more stupid than making the “A” a “4” within the marketing for the fourth installment, so why the hell stop now? Somehow (I’d imagine) they probably feel it seems more special if they simply call this one “SCREAM” again, bringing it back to its roots like Halloween did - which was equally as silly. Not just silly, it’s straight up CONFUSING and S.T.U.P.I.D.. Where. is. the. number 5. in. the. title? :-)  Ps. I straight up LOVE the first film, still to this day! But literally every movie since then have only been another step down, with the fourth film being the absolute worst. Maybe this SCREAM can be better than “4”, who knows, but I’m sorta already bored just seeing the trailer here. Wait a minute?.. Did I say maybe Scream can be better than the fourth film? What am I talking about, OF COURSE it’s better, lol!.. Oh, but wait once again - we’re not talking about Scream here, we’re talking about the other… Uuuh. Scream? (it’s so dumb)
Oof that January release makes me nervous
Damn, after rework in dbd Ghostface looks kinda OP
It’s an honor !!👻👻 omgosh I can’t wait!!!!
I stopped the trailer halfway. They were showing too many kills. summarizing the whole film.
Can't wait
Omg!!!!!
I do have one concern & it’s that he’s not sanitizing his knives. 😳
I bet dewey is gonna die this movie.
They could have gone with 5CREAM, but oh well
love it
Can’t wait✌️💪🙏
HELP
Legit tired of these remakes or conituations of movies thats have been out forever this looks lame
IF SIDNEY DIES IM SUEING
Welcome to the Kill Count. I'm James A Janisse and today we're covering Scream 5, the 2022 theatrical release.
AHHHHHH
So grateful to see such diversity in the main cast. Representation matters... even if they are all gonna be gutted like fish.
I LOVE SCREAM bc I Love Wes Craven but idk man Scream 4 was a complete trashcan and how many Copycat killers are there going to be? Leave their old asses alone already.
Yay I'm so excited for this and Halloween kills I'm going to see it
The title makes me not want to see this movie🥴
"I'm Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun" that was the badass line EVER.
dope 🔥
This looks amazing
I’m so happy!! LFG Scream Franchise
This definitely looks like they went darker and paying respect to Wes craven , this is IT & Sidney looks like she isn’t taking no ones shittt this time 🔪
Wassuuuup!!! 👽
Scream IT, Baby!
I'M FEELIN' A LITTLE WOOZY HERE
Dewey using a revolver?? Come on mannnnnn
Sidney Prescott is back bitches!!!
LMAO
#HelloSidney, It’s Me #Ghostface
Okay cast is on 🔥🚒
If it’s Danny Johnson, I’ll freak out! But I have a feeling this is a not so dead Stu coming back for revenge.
LETS GOOOOO!!!!
WTFFF JENNA DIED ALREADY
yess can’t wait for this. Scream was my first slasher  movie
Oh sh!t dbd references
Are they just going to remake every film series we like?
Why couldn’t they call it “Screaming” or  Scream 5?
Calling it right now! Gale screaming because they’ll make it like like dewy is dead but he will finally be behind the mask later in the end!
Huh Here We Go Again
Chillin killin.
I feel like this takes place after the first one because the synopsis says 25 years later
I've been waiting for this! 😍
Yeah ghostface is back, babyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!
5CREAM
Yeah baby yeah let’s slice and dice
YEEEESSSSS!!!!!!
Hard *"Looks like a tall glass of FUCK NO!"* from me.  One of the Big 3 is the killer. Or they murk off the Big 3 with the killer.  😑🙄😒
LET'S GOOOO!!
Trailer was 🔥. Had me a little nervous tho, I thought they was going to show to much in it 😂
Ain't nobody gonna comment on the unlocking doors for no reason other than the it said so in the script? Somehow these 'horror' flicks would be actually scary if they weren't depicted to be so fucking unrealistic, plot contrived. The killer can do anything and be anywhere, teleport as to be always behind you, it's always night, the people are always alone. Fucking tired tropes. Yawn.
Let's go!!!! I binge 1-3 a few months ago and absolutely love them Please be good, please be good
If this is the start to a new trilogy then definitely some or one of the original 3 will die
"Feels different" "rules" "it's an honor"... I'm calling it, it's a fan. Nobody actually related to the original killings, just a crazy fan.
Back in the 90s I was too young to watch Scream, so I would secretly watch it on VHS when nobody was home. Cant believe that we get another movie in 2022!
wazzzaaaaaaa!!
I’m calling it…Jack Quaid is the killer
After like 10 years I finally get to experience a new scream movie
Sidney is such a badass. However, if she dies this time, this movie doesn't fucking count. It's like killing Andy in the Chucky series. They killed Laurie in Halloween Resurrection, and it was a complete abortion by default.
One of the best horror franchises ever. I feel they named it just Scream to poke fun at the Halloween series doing it recently lol. Would be on brand for the franchise. Seems this movie is in good hands too, people behind Ready or Not are on it. Can’t wait! Haven’t caught opening night at a theatre in ages but I will be at this showing no matter what. Stoked for the younger generation to get introduced to the franchise too.
Been a decade since Scream 4 and there was about a decade of time between scream 3 and 4. So I’ll see y’all again around 2032 for Scream 6
YESSS BEEN WAITING FOR THIS! Let’s see who survives this fatal game 🔪
It’s probably multiple people, and one of them is Hughie from the Boys.
Scream 4
I bet it’s Richard trying to kill Monica because she married Chandler and not him
this actually looks good
In the last couple of shots it looks like stu's house please bring him back
It's crazy that Courteney Cox looks better than both David Arquette and Neve Campbell I mean I understand she'd look better than David but damn...
I wanted to see Jenna ortaga's character the most and they kill her in the trailer straight away at least clay Jensen from 13 reasons why is looking alive and well 😂
Looks like a TV movie
They better not kill any of the original cast members that's what I'm going to say
Let’s Ride or Die Baby!!! I’m ready!!! 🎃🎃
Bad: Spoils who gets killed. Not enough wide shots and sense of chase scenes. Too dark cinematography like Scream 4. Good: More serious and camp-free tone. It's a Scream movie, so it can't be like the other casual attempts to make a decent modern slasher movie.
can you imagine if the killer would actually be Dewey and Gale working together?? or at least one of them? just saying, cause i have a feeling it might be the case this time 😱
OH MY FUCKING GOD.
There's Sydney from scary movie 2002
Lfg!!!!!
Let’s fucking gooooo!!!!!
Les go this is real
Its from cod
This is gonna be good 😊
Hello Sidney ❤❤❤❤❤
Looks great!  I just have one question:  Who still has a landline?
My god Hollywood...can u just fuckin give up of all these shit tier remakes and sequels already?
This is lame. And not needed. And I don't think there is an amount of money you could pay me to watch it. Paramount, why in the hell can't you just green light some NEW stories, NEW ideas for movies? Why do you have to re-hash every damn thing? Hey, why not reboot Wayne's World while you're at it? LAME.
So they are killing her as the opening kill! Thought she was gonna be a more main character! Really looking forward to seeing the new characters and old characters work together. I think Dewey will become one of my favourites. I predict he will sacrifice himself at the end. Could it be the child of the original killer
"The attacks were all on people related to the original killers"   So in other words one of them is most definitely Billy or Stu's son/daughter.
This looks a little too dark which is not what the Scream franchise was about. It was a little more tongue and cheek. But this looks like they are trying to turn it into Halloween. This would be like taking all the humor out of Freddy Krueger
Wait, why doesn't Hughie just call up The Boys to take this killer down?
Sucks how movies cannot be new or creative anymore, everything’s a remake or sequel from 20 years ago for nostalgia
🤦‍♂️
I'm glad there was someone there to record David Arquette when he got the phone call that they're making another Scream movie and they want him back so he called his agent told him it's happening again and asked if he had a gun.
Dude why didn’t they tea-bag at the exit gate
Meh.  Scream was just OK.  I doubt I ever watch this movie.  All that matters is Halloween Kills comes out Friday!
that 1 line didn't make a Lick of sense "all the attacks were on People related to the Original Killers" I'm pretty sure the 3 Killers in the 1st Film the 1 or 2 killers in the 2nd film as well as the killer in the 3rd and the killers in the 4th all killed more than just people they were related to some of the killers weren't even related to any of the main characters or victims
Hollywood sucks.
Neve Campbell doesn't look like she's close to be 50 at all. Did she learn Hamon or something?
I'm 50/50 on this. Usually January is a dumping ground for bad movies BUT obviously with Covid it could just be a matter of this was as soon as they could get it out as it does look genuinely decent! Will deffo give it a chance!
Now all we need is a new nightmare on elm street and Friday the 13 movie to come out and we chillin bois 😎
Yeap yeap yeap! My fave franchise is BACK. The og trio better survive or else 🔫 🔫 🔫
She's cute
Talk about retreading old ground...
Sidney: I'm getting too old for this shit....
La misma mierda
Can't wait! I love what Radio Silence did with Ready Or Not. Kevin Williamson praised these guys. Said Wes would be proud. Can't freaking wait!!!
None of the original characters are going to die is my guess.
Ghostface: “you want to play a game” Jigsaw: “Hey that’s my line. Get your own catchphrase” Plot twist: Jigsaw is the killer
Rinse and Repeat, they still have time to call it Scream 5 so that its not stupid
Ahhh até que fimmm
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I really can't take Ghost Face a serious killer because of Scary movie
It looks so gooood!! the killer is tied to one of the 6 killers for sure. im not sure its connected to scream 4 killers tho. but maybe. im so exciteddd. one of the best franchise's
The killers in this franchise have zero credibility if three of the original main characters are still alive for a 5th movie. #pass
Dylan minnette was the only one not shown getting attacked hes the killer
quote of 2021: HELLO PETER.(doc ock) ghostface: hold my sidney. (releases scream 5 trailer)
Too bad these movies suck…
So I think this looks decent. A bit generic and it releasing in January is a big red flag. When has a January horror movie been good? But I love every Scream movie and ghostface, so I'll see it in theaters
Really hope this is better than Scream 4 😫 that was so disappointing.
Ghost face moving like Batman
AMAZING I LOVE IT SO MUCH. CANT WAITTT OMG OMG OMG!!!
Hyped. Don't know how they'll do it, but I hope they top Jill. She was the best killer since the original.
BROOOOOOOOOOO
Oh this is easy the killer is Courtney Cox you can tell the way when she embraced David Arquette, who I have to say be looking like Dr. Loomis in this shit!!! Carrying a six shooter and all. Seriously though I'm calling it, it's either Courteney Cox or they brought Matthew Lillard back...
Sorry Sydney and ghostface ain’t jack shit the real ogs Laurie strode and Michael Myers
*When you realize this is the second time it's been 10 years since a Scream film... damn I'm old.*
When the trailer didn't show much exposure to Dylan i knew he's the slasher
I love that we see Stu’s house from the first film 😱
and here goes sidney to face him, all for us we always give money to this franchise and i ask is it worth it?..... course :P
THIS is going to be KILLER! 😱🔪 Totally feels like the SCREAM I know.. I have a feeling this is gonna be as Iconic as the first one...The lines are already iconic...and this is just the trailer! 🤞
I’M SO EXCITED FOR THIS It’s so good to have Sidney, Gale and Dewey back
I'm so hyped for this. My all time favourite Horror franchise and I'm ready to Scream all over again. Wes would be proud
The voice seems a little off is it not the same voice actor?
I wonder if Dewey and Gale are still married in this movie since we haven't seen them in a scene together based on this trailer, if I'm not mistaken. I hope the original trio share a scene together while they fight the ghostface.
*I wonder who's in the wheelchair at **1:37**. I always wanted Kirby to come back...*
Scary movie
each scream follows a the rules of a horror movie so which horror movie rules is this one following? cause scream is the rules of a typical horror movie, scream 2 is rules of a sequel,scream 3 is rules of a trilogy and scream 4 is rules of a reboot. so is this one gonna be the rules of a franchise?
don’t do my boi Kyle Gallner like that trailer, he’s one of my biggest draws besides the og trio!
Im already in love with this movie
I am crying with excitement. I wonder if that release date applies to Australia or just the US.
I don’t care what they call this movie. I’m still referring to it as SCREAM 5. 🔪
Omg yesss
Not Jenna Dying first😭😭 was looking forward to see her kick some ass! Lol
Hello,  sidney. it's a honor. 🔥🔥😥
Its been a long time since I was excited to see a slasher film again.
Thanks #ParamountPictures
So what am I calling this movie? Scream 5 or Scream 2022?
My only fear is that a movie franchise about copycatting murders doesn't result in yet another real life copycat murder inspired by this movie.
HYPERVENTILATING!!!!
XD I cannot wait for this! I LOVE THESE MOVIES!
Hello...grrrrr ....grrrrr.....grrrr
This New Movie Is Going To Be Horror Until Jan 14 2022
For Wes 👏🙏🏼
I’m genuinely surprised they showed stabs in the trailer 🤭 still looks good tho CANNOT WAIT 🤪🔥
Officer Doofy reporting!  *holds up vacuum cleaner*
OMG HYYYYYYPE!!! 😮😮😮
It's the same shit as the last ones 🤦‍♂️
I know the trailer makes it look like this “Tara” will be the opening girl but I feel like Judy Hicks (Marley Shelton) from Scream 4 will be the opening kill in this one. A familiar face that will be taken out in the opening. That’s why Dewey looks depressed because he’s lost a friend and his arc will be getting revenge.
lol what if it's matt lillard again, just 50+ years old still killing teenagers
Ursula Buffay's stalker teaming up with Monica Bing.....Okay, I'll watch it, but it's a January movie though.
Can I watch it without watching the old movies?
Hell yaaa ! I already have so many theories I'm ready!
Let’s go I’m so hyped
yessss sidney
Can't wait to see
January movies are notorious for being subpar, I hope this is good!! It looks honestly not bad at all! 🔪🔪🔪
This looks fucking amazing 🔥
They dragged poor Kyle gallner into this i see
What if that scene with Gale being hysterical in the trailer is a misdirect? Some think it’s because of Dewey’s death, but what if it’s a scene in the ending of the film and it was Sidney who died.
Starr at him so he doesn’t get his power
"Hello sydney its an honor"🤫
Woah! Looks amazing! Can't wait! "Hello Sidney! It's an honour"
Another follow up to my favourite horror movie
This looks like theyre doing it justice, hope its good!
Do you have a gun?  She's American, of course she's gonna have a gun
It’s gonna be Dewey lol
Going back to Stu's house @01:55 for the finale of this film would be a great way to wrap the franchise up. Things coming full circle so to speak.
He/She is back, Scream aka GhostFace is back within Woodsboro and She/He is commenting Murder once again.  I hoping it could be Stu behind the GhostFace mask or someone within their group of friends.
So is this part 5?
I laughed at the beginning, not because it was funny, but because I won the token minority bet so fast.
you poor thing
What if all three of the original cast are the killers and they’re getting rid of the relatives to prevent any of them from potentially following in their footsteps; to prevent a “remake” of the original events. It could be a commentary on the original  films outranking the (sometimes) unnecessary remakes/reboots. OG fans don’t oftentimes appreciate the remakes. Something like that.
Yeah baby!!!!!!  👻🔪
This looks awful. While the original was sharp, satirical and groundbreaking, this looks like a formulaic cheap fan service rehash.
Eh.. I'll pass
The girl should've hide in a locker.
Sideney…You finally have A GUN! You’ve should be like Laurie now after all this damn time.
If the don't kill all of the originals I don't c scream going on long. I love the og cast but the best part of that cast died in scream 2. Idk or if they went the Halloween route where they only have the original and went with the cast years later but I don't think we will get that. Guessing rn but Sidney lives (surprise 😔) Gail lives but gets hurt (like the original) and Dewey (only expendable so might die but prob just gets really really hurt...again). This type of stale formula is y I stopped watching scream. By the 3rd outting they killed the best character and had to bring him back and can't this time. I won't b seeing this. Love the series but prob more of the same.
“It’s an honor” hmmmmm
OMG
Looking at the screenwriter, James Vanderbilt and that leaves me with little hope, but both The Amazing Spider-Man movies had that relation gimmick. PS: The killer is gonna be female.
OMG EVERYONE IS BACK YESSS
Can someone change my bed sheets!? 'Cause sh*t just hit the fan! OMG 😱
I LOVE IT
But will they kill some of the og characters though?
Not bad, looks good ...was waiting all night for this ! Only issue is the name there is only one scream..if they didn't wanna call it scream 5 coulda put u like (Scream 'the new chapter') or something..
I dunno... This franchise is so dated. It peaked w/ Scream 2.
Imagine if Dewey is ghostface
When does the second trailer drop im fucking seething that i cant watch the movie i dont wanna wait whos with me
Me and Ghostface have beef now because of jenna
“Hi my names Sidney, and my life, is kinda crazy.”
Calling it now, it’s dylan minnette
Oh wauh que emoción!! :0!
New scream movie. What should we call it? Scream retribution, scream revenge, the new scream, still screaming? Some jackass: how bout...scream. like we r going back to our roots. Ya makes sense.
I am in!
This looks awesome! I’m a big fan of the original SCREAM so I’m totally gonna watch this.
Omg can’t wait
*"Would you like to play a game?"*  Ummmm... *Jigsaw* left the chat 😳
See that's why I'm happy living in the 90s still and I don't have any "smart" shit other than a stupid phone. I still have an LED TV... Ain't no one hacking my Fuckin deadbolts...
I can tell they took this seriously. Very impressed. That mask is so iconic.
This looks great!!  Especially compared to all these crappy slashers Netflix has been releasing lately
One day after my birthday Nice. I love these movies. Hellooooo Sidney ❤️
ILYSM SIDNEY
Can't wait. ¡¡¡This is gonna be amazing!!!
ITS TIMEEEE
I love that they're keeping up that trope and telling us we were right with the Jenna Ortega thing.
Scream>Halloween
Dewey’s like a BADASS This time around. Which is good. I hate when he’s just the punchline.
It doesn't matter that they changed production company and that's why they couldn't simply leave it as Scream 5, people will know this one as Scream 5 anyway.
First Halloween now Scream! We need to bring more old Horror franchises back.  Looks friggen insane
This genuinely looks and feels like a return to form.
Great trailer, who do you think this Ghostface will be?
It's Gale... as previous sequels have proven, the killer could be anyone. They throw some hard "he" pronouns out there to refer to the killer which could be misdirection. Dewey is clearly living alone by the looks of his house and kitchen sink which means he and Gale aren't together anymore. The killer is shorter than Dewey (5'10") and Gale is 5'5". The killer looks to be struggling to overpower the one actress on the ground at 2:00 which suggests they're closely matched in 💪. Gale is probably a struggling true crime Podcaster at this point, looking for her next big story.
Bruh this actually looks kinda good? I'm hyped
I was expecting him to wipe the blade before he attacked Sidney at the end
Holy Shit YES
Oh I see they took the Halloween approach with the title...
This looks good!  I'm all in.
it's sad Jenna Ortega is the opening kill. 🤧
My gut feeling tells me Dylan Minnette could be the killer or one of the killers. Something about him bearing a resemblance to Stu and Stu's house being heavily featured in the trailer.
Ahh it looks so AMAZING!!!
Jenna Ortega is my celebrity crush
1 hour early lets goooo
shout out chris from 3cfilms I know everything about this movie I need to know
Craven will be proud. RIP.
I love all Scream Movies. Those movies were so awesome. Can't wait for this one
Sidney: another killer oh come on I can't catch a fucking break
Yes!
YassssS Finally 🩸🔪 It's A SCREAM BaBy..🩸🔪
Looks like Courteney Cox will be using this as her audition tape for the House of Wax reboot.
Damn I can't believe Scream 4 was 2011 I'm getting Fuckin old... Oh shit do I get to make one of those comments where I say this is my childhood yo being born in 89' and all.
Does anyone know if this is a whole reboot or is it like Michael Myers that is a reboot but it’s connected from the first movie in 1976
I know who I'm being for halloween 🎃
It's 2021 so Ghostface is texting now!
Sheriff Judy Hicks is in trouble
I have this feeling that dewey might actually be the killer this time 🤔
GhostFace : surprise Sidney  Sidney : Stu ? GhostFace : my mom and dad gonna be so mad at meeeeeee
I thought Jenna Ortega was going to be opening kill but I guess she survived and is the one on the wheelchair at the hospital and that's why Dewey told Sidney there were attacks and not death.
This looks corny 👎🏾👎🏾
Wazzup
Courtney cox looks more made of plastic in this one...
The BEST Frases 2021  "Hello Peter"  "Hello Sidney"
WHY KILL OFF JENNA ORTEGA WHYYYYYYY :(
Meh lol
8ve been waiting so fkn long for this!!
Iconic!!!!
💜💜💜💜💜
Poor Sydney! Having to deal with this shit for 30 years now.
It's coming out in January. That's a bad sign. I hope I'm wrong.
Surprise Sidney!
Why is neve campbell and others in a parody of scream?  If this was in any way good, it would be released around halloween, not january.
"Would you like to play a game?" No! The line is: "What's your favorite scary movie?"
I'm glad they found a way to make this work. Also gotta love polite Ghostface with the "It's an honor" line.
Damn I feel like a lot was shown for a first trailer but I guess some of this could be stab fake out right?
"Hello Peter" was cool, but "Hello Sidney" is really awesome!
Same old shit
What, no Matthew Perry, Matt Le Blanc, David Schwimmer, Lisa Kudrow, and Jennifer Aniston?
What if it’s Stu? Bc he wasn’t shot in the head in the first one? He had a tv fall on him.  Or maybe, JUST MAYBE, Sidney had a baby by Billy between scream 1 & 2 and gave the child up for adoption and that’s the new killer?
OMG YAASSS 😭😭😭😭🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 this looks so good! It better be as good as the trailer. Kinda sad Jenna Ortega is the opening kill. Like I really wanted to see her and Dylan Minnette as the new Sidney and Randy.
I'm sooo frickin excited
Ghost face what you been doing all this time  Ghost face : Nothing much just taking some time off hanging out with the other slasher characters from horror movies but just like Michael Myers I’m back
THIS IS GOING TO BE AMAZING
Let’s face it, baby, these days you gotta have a sequel
Imagine if Sidney is Ghostface now!
The killer is probably the child of one of the original killers
Yo it’s the guy from warzone
A movie about the Ghostface from DBD, AKA Danny Johnson would be cool. His lore is really interesting
Don't know who Sidney is holding her gun up to but the part with it's an honor Ghostface is going after someone who is on a kitchen floor cuz we can see the oven.
So buzzed, I think Dewey may have never moved on, like I get the vibe that he’s sorta made it his whole life, almost like he needs ghostface to function, he feels he has no purpose now
IM SO EXCITED YESS
imagine the killer is someone frok the old movies I doubt it but that would be cool
has someon from the boys, vida and 13 reasons why
this looks pretty great i’m not gonna lie. also dewey prob gonna die. which i think makes sense. i just hope they do it right and make it meaningful
Would you like to play a game? New phone who dis?
That shot of Gale screaming is giving me “Dewey is dead” vibes. Kill the new ppl, leave the OG’s alone.
Poor Sidney. She just can't catch a break...
Ok in that quick cut Gale looks pretty upset.. got me thinking one of the OGs gets it…
This was incredible!😭😭😭
This is some good shit!!
I'm praying you don't screw up the legacy of Wes Craven.
Now dont tell me that there's a scary movie reunion with Anna Faris coming up😅
Well i'm certainly excited for this
Is this going to be Rated R?
Yoooooo wtfffrrd
Oh on January 14 2022 its after my birthday
Boring  trailer  . Thought id be more hyped up but its the same thing over agine  . This may be worse  the 4 !
GOVNO
We all know this is Scream 5. Just call it Scream 5.
I spy Stu's house.
pla tell me his name is Danny Johnson
Scream 5 ! When I was a kid I was Ghostface for different Halloweens ! I've seen all of them including a parody version of Scream in Scary Movie ! And I yes I remember that it wasn't only a parody of Scream ! And anyways I would really love to go see this ! What I really loved about this custom that it will work for many people depending on your body ! Hell I might be the only 30 year old dressed as Ghostface going Trick or Treating ! In the custom no one can tell my age ! 🤣
Beyond incredible! I love that they’re going for the same style as the first scream movie trailer. Extremely serious, no room for satire.
I saw the original one back in 96 ! I’m 39 now ! Can’t wait to see this one
So it's Scream 5, but you're just calling it Scream? Please stop confusing the series.
When I watched this I... SCREAMed!
It looks actually good thank god, I’m so excited
Who the hell has a landline phone in 2021? Just saying
LETS FUCKING GOOO!! ITS A SCREAM BABY!!!
Good trailer but I miss the meta.
Poor Jenna I fear she's gonna be the "Drew Barrymore" of the movie😭😭
Wow... Because I'd love to see a tired horror story in January.
Saludos desde México!!! 🙊🙊🙊🙊
(Whispering) He’s back!!
I'm calling it now...... Dewey is the killer
LETS FUCKING GOOO!!! ITS BEEN A DECADE LONG BUT IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!
WHO IS DISLIKING THIS ! Damn it !
Well, this looks like a major improvement from scream 3.
I so exciting take notes hellraiser that how you make a good movie not remove the pepe off of pinhead
The moment she opened the door and got slashed, my mind replayed that scene but changed it too instead of being slashed by scream, just slaps her real fast then says "Why do you open the door, are you stupid or something?!" My mind thinking those old scary movie comedy films.
Pretty sure it’s gonna be Emma Roberts under that mask. “Surprise bitch! I bet you thought you’d seen the last of me”
I know who the killer is
Bad ass!  I do believe that the killer will be revealed as being Stu from the first film. I believe he survived the TV smash to the head from Sidney and is back! 🔪
Yes, I feel this one should be good
“ Hello Sydney. It’s an honor.” Got goosebumps!
BRO I FUCKING CANT WAIT
If Jenna dies, I die!! 😢 Besides the OG cast coming back, I wanted to see my girl Jenna survive, but I guess she’s dies! 😔
Ghost face😍😎
I hope my girl Jenna lives. Although it doesn't look like it from the trailer, I'm holding out hope.
Dude I'm so fucking hyped I've been a Scream fan since I was 7!
LETS GOOOOO
Something about this one just feels different…hope so.
it looks aight. I grew up with the original trilogy and part 4 sucked balls. this one I'm not looking forward too. the same formula as the previous ones but I will say that ghostface sounds more sinister and will be more brutal.
At the start was that Casey Becker's house
Sydney Fucking Prescot!!!! Shut the hell up and take my money.
Cool trailer, really excited for the film.  But seriously, would it fucking kill you people to just simply call it Scream 5?! Why confuse audiences like this?!
Another trash remake :/
YES AT LAST ANOTHER SCREAM MOVIE
I feel Sydney gonna die bc she not the main character
I am scared to have a landline now….
They just gave away 3 killings.  I hope they didn't spoil too much good stuff.  Neve still looks fantastic.🥰
Dear studio. We DONT need 15 more trailers. This was enough!
Morrendo de ansiedade aqui!!!!! 😍❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Yaaaas 🔥🔥🔥🔥 can't wait! They're gonna take one of our main 3 this time for sure so if yal hear me crying in the theater mind your business😭😭
what your favourite scary movie .
Hello Sydney...
Definitely how to reboot a franchise for the modern era. “I’m Sidney Prescott. Of course I have a gun.” Straight up facts after 4 previous films.
The merkins make the soundtrack? 🤣, sorry but I love the chanel of this guy's
EVERYBODY'S A SUSPECT!! - RIP Randy  Cant wait for a new Scream!
So excited 😆
"Would you like to play a game, Tara?" "No, thank you." "Understandable, have a great day!"
Omggggg I can’t WAIT!!
Jenna 😩😍
Just call it Scream 5.  Not a big deal, guys.
I’m loving this but where is the famous iconic line: “what’s your favorite scary movie?” 🥺 please I have loved all 4 scream movies I hope this one doesn’t disappoint, but it does look very good😻🥰
00:22 . Sir please this isn’t a saw movie💀🖐🏻
Why isn’t this titled Scream 5? What is it with reboots these days just taking the title of the original film, it can get a little confusing.
Why do the same opening though 🥴🥴 be waiting for this to stream won’t be worth the money
I wouldn't be too surprised if the killer was either Randy or Cotton Weary.
Yes! My favorite horror franchise
Again?!?!
I wish they would have kept the fact that the new victims are related to the original killers. Back in the 90’s movie trailers were only like 45 seconds to 1 minute, they should have went back to that.
I could just hear the  "hello Emma" when she answered the phone
For anyone wondering, this is both a sequel and a reboot.  Also Monica Geller returns so that's poggers
THIS IS REAL
Randy's sister maybe?
HELLO SIDNEY OMG OMG OMG OMG I'M OUTTA MY MIND, I WAITED 10 YEARS FOR THIS 😭😭😭😭😭😭
So many spoilers omg 🤦😷
notice how many franchises are centered around white male rage
If Gale dies, I will RIOT!
Guy ... i love you ❤ so so much 💗 💓 💛
Another unnecessary sequel.
"Do you want to play a game?" Is another serial killer's catchphrase, Cmon!!!
Time to scream without the s I guess ✨
I’m so moist right now 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
FIRST HALLOWEEN NOW SCREAM ,HELL YEAHH
хороший фильм был... интересно что же в новой серии!
It’s stu
So excited
yikes...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
LFG
All i know is david arquette will go through major amounts of pain but come out fine
omg it will be the same movie but with ugly women this time
Stu: Surprise sidney
It's Dewey. Too easy.
In my opinion I think this Ghostface mask is the best one than the originals
You poor thing
"I'm Sidney Prescott of course I have a gun" what a  icon
90's is coming back, Baby! I like to hear their 'Scream' one more time.  What about 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'? I hope they will make another sequel for this movie anytime soon.
Scary movie is the reason why u cant take this franchise seriously... anymore
I AM SO READY 🔪
This is the first Scream movie to not be directed by Wes Craven. I hope it doesn't feel like a generic horror movie. Although on the plus side, it is directed by the two guys that made Ready or Not. So that at least shows that they aren't just random random directors that have been hired.
Heard gale weather is the killer now, so she was threaten to loose her job an she needed a story so she lost her fuckin mind an became the killer
Seriously, the main cast should just split up, move out of town and never meet each other again. After 4 movies they should figure out by now.
Don’t forget it comes out in January so it might be trash
YO! My name is Wes Craven, born and raised, my horror films, yeah? Yeah, those were my days. Stabbing and beating outside of the schools, wearing ghost face masks, killin all the fools. When a couple of gals, who were up to do good, starting making progress in their neighborhood. They got in one little fight with ghost face killa, made a few sequels that felt like vanilla. Then I died, but my legacy ain't dead, cause here we have part five, being back the dread!
Finally!!!!! Worth the wait for the trailer! It’s a scream baby
Let’s see if they have the balls to kill one of the main og characters 😂
She's Sidney fucking Prescott. She's built for this.
Ofc one of the main characters in the beginning makes a dumb decision to answer the phone and the door just like every basic horror movie
I’m sorry but having the locks on your house linked to an electronic device was that girls first mistake.
Leads back to the first film, Stu & Billy being a focal point
This is going to be awesome!!!!!!
I'm sending my FRIEND kat this
3 Characters you obviously expect to have a gun.  1 Sidney Prescott  2 Yosamity Sam 3 Barrett Final Fantasy
Anyone else feel like this trailer is giving away too much?
Why isn't this called Scream 5?
the wallows guy is sus
Damn I was 12 when the first scream cameout and I'll be 38 when scream 5 comes out
Looks like shit
Hell Yeah!!!!!
DAY 1 IM FUCKING THERE YALL DOING WES CRAVEN RIGHT THEY TOOK WES CRAVENS BABY AND BROUGHT HIM BACK IN A EPIC FASHION DAY 1 NUFF SAID
It releases on my birthday so it will be a scream to see in theaters
SHE SAID HE
Officer Doofy turned into a hardcore badass
Who else thought “wassuuuuuup” when the phone rang?😂
This looks so awesome
I bet it's Stu
0:00 *Is it me or does that look like the Myers House?*
Stu's old house....
I AM SO READY!!!!!!
I have waited so long for this. FINALLY!!! Yes
Scary movie 4 or 5 or wahatever
Spoiler the killer is Jamie Kennedy
This just in: stock prices for home security applications plummets after trailer debut
The only thing scary about this is how they think people still have landlines lol
Oh fuck yes!!!! I'm so ready!!!
They showing too much. You literally know who's gonna die...😒
#ScreamMovie🖤📺🎬🖤!
I just cant let go of the scary movie parody hahahaha.. thats why it seems not  scary to me
eyy this looks pretty good
The twist it was a ghost, that would surprise me, it's probably clay do
So we have Ghostface in a new movie and in Warzone, What an amazing halloween.
#itshughie
OMG FINALLY BABY
My prayers have been answered. But so help me lord if you Kill Dewey I will never forgive this franchise.
Rules To Surviving A Horror Movie:  You can never have sex! You can never drink, or do drugs! And never, ever, under any circumstance say "I'll be right back", because you won't be right back!  P.S. DON'T FUCK WITH THE ORIGINAL !!!
I can't wait!!!!
It honestly looks scary!!! I can’t wait
January?? Gotta be cautious of horror films releasing January
Yawwnnning already LOL
*Hello Sidney.* Brings me so much goosebumps
Hello, Sidney. Its an honor." 🥰
Omg I cant wait till january
Big ol “meh” from me.
Is it just me, or does it feel weird to see Dewey look so old? I mean, he always had a boyish looking charm to him in all of the other Scream movies, even in Scream 4. Not this time around. Oh well, still can’t wait to see this in January.
IM SO MAD I WAS EXCITED TO SEE JENNA IN THIS MOVIE BUT SHES THE FIRST TO DIE???????? 🙄
I just really hope this isn't another "technology=bad" movie
I’m Sidney Prescott of course I have a gun 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️
FUCK YEAH
I can't help but think of Scary Movie
Dylan minette being in this is another reason for me to watch this
Bet "Alexa" will be the FIRST Death!! lol
Omg I can't wait
This January the gang dies
Ah shit, here we go again!
GALE SCREAMING FOR DEWEY'S DEATH??
New killer must be a hacker this time
Neve is looking good🤗
SIDDDDDD
Oh wow!
YESSSSS!!!!!!! FINALLY! 🩸 🔪
Ehhhhhhh!!!!!! I can wait until January! But Team Sidney! GREATEST FINAL GIRL EVER!
This trio survived back in 1996,1997,2000, 2011= one of them are going to die "2022"
Well the beginning pretty much shows there’s 2 killers
I'm convinced we've rebooted the timeline and we're back to the late 90s / early 2000s
I believe i know one of the killers. But not say... but got a clue.  This be good
Can't wait for them to unmask the killer and it's Randy's long lost twin brother and also cousin somehow who is on a revenge mission twenty years late because Randy's murder ruined his dream of being a famous horror filmmaker.  Or maybe there's two killers again and the other one is an android version of Cotton Weary, which is just a CGI de-aged Liev Schreiber.
IT'S AMAZING!!!!!!
That's so cool!!! I will watch it!!
I'm so excited.... Faaaaak
*"Surprise Sidney."*
RIP Randy, it your time to finally rest.
I guarantee one of the killers is Stew from The original Scream
Dylan!😀
Joe is the killer. Duhh!
could be the best horror movie since scream 4 ?
my only disappointment is …. i guess kirby really died in 4 when she was left for dead
Imagine not using a flashlight to blind him smh
Hello Sidney, so long man..
Alright let’s place bets. Which og member do you think is gonna die. Sidney, Gale, or Dewey?
Looks better than the 4th. I do love Marley Shelton is back and seems to have more to do this time. She's so underrated
Yasss can’t wait !!!!
Bye-bye Dewey... 2:01
I guess Jenna Ortega is the first kill
This looks amazing. I'll be there at the premiere
Can’t waiiitttt
You can watch the scream movies again and again. It only gets better. Cant wait for this one.
I thought October was the release month 🤘
It feels a time for a blonde killer, maybe it is dylan minnette?idk, maybe
“the killer is going after people related to the original killers”   calling it now: sidney and billy had a secret child and he/she is the new ghostface
Omg!! I'm so excited!!!
HOLY CRAP HOLY CRAP HOLY CRAAAAAAAAAAP
My favorite franchise of all time is back! Lets goooo
How Ironic that Ghostface returns in the Reboot of Scream (1996) and the Original Characters are Back.
It's back baby!! I LITERALLY CAN'T WAIT!! I just hope Jenna Ortega isn't the opening kill. Love to also see the original trio back ♥️🔪
The hype is real. Idk why I'm feeling this but Jack Quaid might be the killer this time.
THERE'S NO WAY I'M MISSING THIS MOVIE WHEN IT COMES OUT
Yoo looks sick!
Watch it be connected to stu....or someone
CALLING IT NOW:  Sam Hyde is the killer. Screenshot this.
Hollywood need to leave the classics alone
Otro slasher que está de regresó
I hope it’s good 😊
Seeing Sidney again is BREATH-TAKING buuuutt... this looks VERY GENERIC
God this looks generic and boring as all hell
YASSSSSS
Omg!!!!!
Ah, the originality of Hollywood. Scream with Technology.
I thought Scream 4 is the last one. But here we are again. Nothing can beat the original (first) Scream movie. Who's with me?
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Ghostface FTW
oh my god scream 5 2022 😱👍
Samantha is the killer
This trailer basically spoiled that Jenna Ortega is the opening kill! Thanks Paramount! 🤦‍♂️
Damn Neve Campbell looks good still
Let's gooo, they got the og cast too!
Sidney why you so scared?? Shoot that mug!
So Dewey definitely dies…
Nobody touches my girl Sidney
Oh yeah I am so looking forward to this!!
Looks really good so far. Definitely going for a scary element.
Joe Goldberg won’t be stopped
It’s happening every body stay calm, STAY CALM
Been hearing this based off the first 96 and skipping the others. It explains well because Dewy is alive and well, I like this Halloween reboot did the same
They better keep the funny goofy tone from the previous 4, I'm getting a feeling that Wes Kraven will be sorely missed from this franchise. He was the mastermind behind it all RIP  Edit: Okay so the directors of Ready or Not is helming this so I'm pretty stoked for that. The movie was hilarious
It could be Stu from the original
Look at the way Gail is screaming...complete pain, heartbreak and sadness...i have a feeling Dewey or Sydney  isn't going to make it...
I can not wait for this to come out.
Ghostface returns in Scream in January!
It looks good, I think Wes would’ve approve
Im ready!
From the directors of vhs and ready or not I'm ok with this hope they do good job with this one make wes craven proud
Would u like to play a game this isn’t saw
“The attacks were all on people RELATED to the original killers.”
A land line in 2022! Who has locks that work on phone apps? I manually lock my doors and windows
Please be a banger movie🙏🏼🙏🏼
This looks like fucking garbage. Just a cash cow.
HO. MI. GA.
it's such a pet peeve of mine when hollywood doesn't number (or at least subtitle) sequels. ya numbered the last 4
FINALLYYYYYY
I'm all for this!!
I didn't know what to expect but that was amazing!!❤❤❤🍿🍿🍿
This was more funny than scary. I think they should have went for that because this is the most by the books horror trailer I've seen all year.
I’m excited
Dewey gonna die!!!
i’m hoping that billy is somehow involved 😩
It’s Stu’s house in the end of trailer?
Freakin sigh 😞
It's just a guy with a knife.
SCREAM IS BACKKKKKKKKK
For being told this wasn't a sequel, it sure looks like a sequel...
yessss!!!!
Killer : I'm here to kill you.                                                    Monica : I know.
OMG Cannot Wait  Total chills when she enters Stus House There must be some connection to the Original Killers
WAZZZZZUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPPPPPP 😛
I want to like this movie but I feel like it’s going to be 1 hour and 30 minutes of jumpscares
January release date is a horrible sign
Holy CRAP this looks legit amazing!!! "It's an honor, Sidney" CHILLS
Can't wait!!!!! I hope we're getting some amazing chase/death scenes like Casey Becker, Cici Cooper, Jennifer Jolie and Olivia Morris!
The Legend of "Scream" continues, even after Wes Craven's Passing.  Speaking of Scream, What's Your Favorite Scary Movie?
mannnnn is that someone on fire though
They should have stopped after the 3rd movie.  I honestly don't understand why people are impressed and excited over this trailer. It was lame and the whole "someone at my door i get slashed so I'm going to mess with my phone" WHAT nobody would do that. Just very lame... Its 2021 who doesn't have a firearm at home..
Lol I wonder what other shitty story they brewed up this time. The scream franchise ended with the third film.
Let’s gooooo! I’m so excited!!!!!!
Hello Sidney…it’s an honor. 😱
Soo....jenna is the first one to go?
😱😱😱 I’m ready !!!
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaats uuuuuup !!   Shit wrong movie
Going to need Krueg from The Merkins to review this. We all know he can’t stand the GhostFace.
I have a feeling that the killer is cotton Weary's son or daughter, I know that it was never shown that he had a child but that's irrelevant, we didn't know Sydney had a brother too so...
a mask man appear and try to kill everybody. what a plot!!!! still people are watching this type child play????? when Christopher Nolan making "tenet". yes, both are complete different genre. at least make some mature story. we are not living in 70's, 80's or 90's any more.
I truly wish with iconic slashers like these they would leave all kills out of the trailer. Nonetheless this looks so great!
You poor thing
It has been 25 years  and i still get chills  every time !
Damn most of the classic horror slashers are making a comeback recently (Ghostface, Michael Myers, Chucky). How about we get Freddy and Jason next?
Stu' house, stu is alive
I'm loving this slasher genre resurgence that is happening.  I'll be ready for the new Scream in January 2022.
Jenna Ortega's character is already on EDGE when the phone rings, meaning there's already been a murder. She's not opening kill.
SCREAM
90's nostalgia!! I'M HERE FOR IT!!
LET’S FUCKING GOOOOO
Omega beta zeta! Am I the only one who wishes cece somehow survived scream 2? Of course it would have been nice if randy and even Kirby survived 2 and 4, wouldn’t it? But then would it  be idiotic to have so many survivors in the series? Maybe I just have a hard on for Buffy? But wait, aren’t I gay? Does anyone get what I’m doing here?
Well this is getting old
LETSSSSS GOOOOOOOO
Dylan Minnette is so talented
Hey look at that. A movie that actually seems better than the fourth
Halloween Kills is still better
Yesss omg it looks so good 😍🔥🔥🔥 where are the scream fans?
Can you imagine being 50 yrs old and running for your life since high school?
First off why tf would you even unlock the door the fuck
It's Billy Loomis' half sister
Okay let's get something straight I love Saw franchise but you ppl in the comments need to STOP ✋  acting like they stole from Saw cuz in 96 Original SCREAM 😱  was playing a Game 1st !
Can we just let this franchise die? The first 3 was good. I’m so tired of scary movies getting remade badly.
Would love to watch thiss movie can I get the link to watch?
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
Scream 5 and I thought this latest horror movie sequel is supposed to be released by Miramax Films under the Dimension Films label.
Remember Ghost Face always comes in 2
They should have called it SCREAM 5. Some charm has been lost with the music and showing to much. It was alright I guess but we will see.
I'm happy YEAH
Okkkk its time to rewatch
Wes craven will be proud
Why would you open the door???🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️😂🤣😂
man this franchise brings back memories. I remember watching the first 2 on vhs lol.
Never ending horror stories club.
David Arquette should've bring Nick F'n Gage to deal with Ghostface this time around.
I MISSED THIS SO MUCH
I’m not watching if Shaggy is not in it
sydney and laurie strode would make an awesome team
Just don't say, "I'll be right back."
C'est Emile le tueur.
First 5 seconds of the clip is unrealistic. Who has a landline anymore?
Im 39 years old Watched the 1st Scream at 14.
Bro finally!!!!!
Also from what I'm seeing, I'm guessing the killer is a follower from the previous 4 movies and reacting those killings
Looks like they showed us almost all the death scenes
We gonna take bets on 'Billy Loomis knocked a girl up and baby boy is all grown up"?
Neve Campbell ages like fine wine she still soo stunning 💕💕
Do you have a gun? I am sidney prescott of course i do. Priceless.
Okay now we need a new Friday the 13th
No Wes Craven, no thanks
ITS STU!!!
Great to see slasher killers making a comeback. Hope jason is next!
Seriously when can any of these killers just read Sidney's history book and give up and turn themselves in while they have the chance!? They're just wasting their time to get another bullet in their head like the other dumb killers did /=
People still have a house phone?
I’m so hyped for this! Can’t wait to see how this movie goes!
I think I still have my ghost face mask in my room
Keren scream 5 mantap
I REALLY HOPE STU IS SOMEHOW BEHIND ALL OF THIS!!! IM SO EXCITED!
Who the hell still has a house phone?
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YESSSSSS
Hello, Sidney.
Pretty good trailer not much they could have gave away. I have a feeling maybe Dewey and Gale are divorced..
I’m so excited!!!! 😳👀🔪
LET'S FUCKING GOOOO
Notice how the original trailer didn’t show the first kill / cold open of the movie . Something modern trailers should learn . There should be a ghost face killer of movie trailers . So marketing teams will change their tactics for making a real trailer a teaser . Instead of quick summary.
Please for the love of god stop giving sequels the same name as the original. Other than that it looks cool
i really hope they wont kill off jenna ortega way too early like they did with drew :'(
guy I have a question is this Scream 5 are connected scream series too??
this is the best trailer we could ever ask for tbh
Turtle
Am I seriously watching a trailer for a new Scream movie?! I can't believe it! Scream was the first horror film I ever watched and is my favorite movie and most watched of all time how blessed are we Scream fans! Had the same feeling when Scream 4 came out. Can't wait for January 2022!
This looks so good but Jenna it’s the opening killed 😱
I love love love Ready Or Not, one of my all time fave alongside the original Scream! The January time slot makes me nervous, but I still hope this will be a scary smart surprise!!!
I'm so proud of jenna she was great
dead meat is hype right now
And the Classic Legend is bck!!!!  I cant believe ill be witnessing another and new and for sure freaking Scream this age
Hot Take Prediction: The killer is Laurie Strode.
Dylan Minette is the killer. Calling it now.
Jeez, that was painful to watch. Movies are just a parody of themselves anymore.
I’m so excited for this, I LOVE the Scream franchise. But please don’t let Dewey Die, I love Dewey. I’d cry 😭 if Dewey didn’t make it
I AM SCREAMING
So excited!! 🙌🔥
Literally just saw the first one in the theater last night lol
YES! Looks awesome. It has to be better than 4....right? RIGHT?
So which killer secretly had a kid that's behind this?
Lets go!!! I’m excited! 😆
Really creative title
I'm guessing Dewey dies.
AHHHHH NO WAY!!!
0:25 "always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door, it's insulting." Is that right Sydney?
Why did they name it scream and if its anything like the chucky remake set in out horrid pop culture world its gonna be crap
OY MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD
1:24 I'm sorry but what the fuck did they do to Dylan's hair maaan🤣
Thrilling adventure for me...😨😨
I’m 14, me and my cousin used to watch scream in secret because our parents told us we would get nightmares, we did lol, we always watched it around Halloween time and I never thought that I’d get to watch one in cinemas. My cousin got really sick with COVID and I almost lost her. She’s better now and we are so excited to see this!!!!!😩🥳
I am going to scream.
"HELLO SIDNEY" gave me goosegumps
What does it take to kill this guy
Honour Wes Craven right with this film please. I cannot wait for this!!🔥
facadatona
Still sad they didn’t decide to call it 5cream
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔪🔪🔪🔪
"Hello Sidney, it's an honor." Oh my f*ck!
Watching a smart Killer hack a door - Me   Canceling the Amazon door unlocking service - also Me
It looks exactly like Scream 4 and that was shit.
*HELL* yes!! *SCREAM* with me!!!
Scream again?
Was that dr phil?
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THE KILLER IS BILLY LOOMIS SON IM EXCITED
Eu estou preparado, venha!!!! 🇧🇷❤️
Hell yeahhhhhhh thank youuuuu!!!!!
i’m excited…and at the same time, idk how to feel. maybe when it comes out it’ll blow mg mind
Imagine killer is STU
*another Ghostface emerges*  Sidney Prescott: Ah shit, here we go again.
HOLY SHIT
I like to think these revitalizations are tied together like their own Dead by Daylight. Right now while this is happening you've got Micheal elsewhere and both in the same universe.
Whelp I've watched the whole movie now thanks.
Hello Drew!
I don’t mean to be a bummer, and I know it’s just the trailer, but does this look underwhelming compared to the other screams?
This hits different. I’m here for it.
Protect Dewey at all costs
This looks very good,I'm excited for it but why the hell is it called Scream and not Scream 5. It's not a reboot/remake but a sequel so it doesn't make sense to call it just Scream
The Legends are back! So nostalgic right now!
OMG DUDE
By that trailer I hope Dewey doesn't.....
Dead Meat's gonna have a field day with this one.
This looks awesome, I'm begging for it to live up to the scream name
It's still giving me Scream 4 vibes with same ol' knife kills. I hope it surprises me and it's surprisingly good and different from the others. Same house kills, boring! Nothing can capture when Drew was all alone in a glass house in the middle of nowhere. I expected the new writers to get more creative to capture something new that would scare us.
Less is more, they showed to much, we already know those new kids are getting it, and the first part looks like a new version of the drew Barrymore scene from the first one, I'm crossing my fingers and hope this isn't garbage🤘
Man what a trip. We’ve been getting all these icons returning back to back. I’m so ready
Can't wait to see Chris do a breakdown of the 5cream trailer.
I hope the movie has more effort than the trailer
Yes!
Really? The same costume??
It’s probably stu
Cant wait for it at least Sidney and Dewey are returning
Looks pretty promising! I'm sure Wes Craven would be proud that the Scream franchise is being handled with care it seems.
PLEASE not Dewey man😭😭 Why he can’t catch a break! First Tatum, than the college, the mansion & the hospital. Y’all ain’t gotta do us like that omg January needs to hurry UP!
« I won’t sleep until he’s on the ground" YEEEES THIS MOVIE IS GONNA BE SO GOOD 😍😍
So theyre just throwing in updated tech to try to squeeze more money outta this franchise?
⭕Gale and Dawey are the assassin's  Save this 🗡️
I'm due to give birth on the 13th, but this baby is just gonna have to stay put since mama has been waiting for this for a DECADE. Let's fucking go!!!🙌🙌
Goosebumps when I heard the voice
HE'S BACKKKKK!!!!!! 👻😱🔪
That horrific mask scares me every time I see it, I wonder if Courtney Cox will take it off at any point?
Shouldn’t this just be called Scream 5? Don’t disappoint Wes!!
Not sure about the killer. At first I thought maybe Billy or Stu’s father, but chronology would put them both in their 70’s by now. Maybe Randy’s sister? I’m guessing a sibling of one of the victims from the first, but as far as we know Billy and Stu didn’t have any. I guess Casey or Steve might have, but that seems like a stretch. Hope it’s not another mysterious relative of Sidney.
So ready for this! 🔪🔪🔪🔪🔥🔥🔥
can't waitttt old vibesss
Wassssssuuuupppppppp!!!!!!
YESSSIRRRR!!!!!
the cast is a bit eh 💀, but that's until I saw neve
... why are we reviving old franchises? Is originality just gone in Hollywood at this point?
Soo it’s Scream 5?
Dylan’s character is related to Judy Hicks! Guessing son maybe, but it’ll be interesting to see how they’re connected to the original killers.
It's the next generation's turn to Scream.
Damn, hella hyped
The killer better be Stu🤔
Y’all been ducking and dodging that extended car warranty for too long, homeboy is Fed up! 🤬
I was really hyped for Jenna Ortega just for her to be the Drew Barrymore of this movie 😂
SCREAM 5 BABY
OMFG YESSSSSS LFG
🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
The killer is Stu
But why would the old characters want to get involved in a situation that’s basically a copycat?  Hopefully this is justified.
That's Stu's house lol.
Neve ALWAYS said she would never do another sequel without Wes unless it respected & was true to his Legacy! AND NOW WE SEE WHY SHE CAME BACK!  SCREAM IS BACK!!😈🥺😍❤️❤️
Hell.... Fucking... Yes!!
My theory is Ghostface is Dylan Minette. He’s only seen in one scene without ghostface never with him
I thought it was a joke… yessssss!!!!
Literal Goosebumps!!! 🖤
OK, aight. OK. Maybe. We'll see.
If the opening attack of the trailer turns out to be the film’s opening kill, I’m gonna be mad AF….
What if the killer is stu like they originally wanted to do in scream 4 or its like a child of stu or billy
Yoooo
Why i feel like this is a comedy even tho this is a horror? Lmao im obsessed with Scary movie😭
Interesting 🤨
bring back netflix series
Special Officer Doofy reporting for duty....I pooped my pantz
HELL YEAH LETS GO !!!!!!!!!
They need to make a scream game
I think Either Sidney Prescott Finally Meets her maker, Or The Person dressed as Ghostface pose a real significance for The Scream Franchise...I hope they do something new and origional to make this movie relevant
Bruh when he unlocks and locks the door I got chills. The killer is Dewey
Looks cool. Like exactly what it supposed to be.
Liver alone!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!! aAAaAAAAAAAAAAAAG
YES!!!
Wow what a coincidence, I just started watching through the scream films, I've watched scream 1 and 2, gonna watch scream 3 in 3 or 4 hours
Wouldn't it be cool if they reveal that Sidney is the mastermind of all the murders in the Scream franchise...
WAZZUP!!!
I just want to know if Kirby survived 😔
Deputy judy is back also nice
I wanted a sequel to this but in one condition: this movie has to be success bringing back the slasher legacy
So Sydney is pretty much Laurie
Omfggg
The new ghostface sounds like roman’s ghostface
Somehow it gave me chills. Well played Paramout, well played.
Idk something about not seeing that Dimension Films logo before anymore. Still checking this out.
I am here for this! Can’twait. scream 4 was literally 10 years ago😱
Ofc she has a gun 🔫
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mathew Lillard needs to come back from the dead. Otherwise I'm not interested.
Okay so it IS just making fun of the trend of horror movie sequels that hide the fact they're sequels, that's a relief, I was genuinely worried they were considering doing that.
WWOOOOOOOOOOOOOH
Oh myyyyyyyyyyy I'm so so so EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What’s the rules for horror now?  Ummmm well I guess it would be a slow burn until the end?
Oh great, another sequel with a title the same as the first movie. Say, anyone wanna watch Halloween ('78/'07/'18)?
Hello, Sidney. It's an honor.
Wes is the killer, or one of them. Call it a gut feeling. 🤔
And you fools want wireless locks that can’t be controlled by your phone? Screw that. By that Gale screaming scene, I think Dewey might die this time.
Meh. 🥱
Meh was hoping to not meet all the old characters in the trailer but ok lol come on guys make your trailers a bit more suspenseful please it’s almost 2022 give us teases  not the whole thing in one trailer
Oh my god cant wait!!! Still remember ,25years ago, the terrifying of fisrt time watch Scream,Omg love it !
0:21 Triple H on Halloween 😂
Yes!!!!!!!!!!
My bet is on Jack being one of the killers
Nah
Bruh who has landlines any more and screw electronics controlling your house and door locks!
So, I was all - UGH, they didn't need to do this...   That 'ugh' turned into a blistering, near-violent 'YAAAAAAASSSSSSSSS' as soon as Neve popped into frame.  Anyone else?
Why is it just called scream ?  Like the first one....
the new characters are NOT it. The originals were on point
Again 🗡 Scream 😱
Ghostface is back!  :D
Va a estar al tiro esta película 🎥 ya quiero verla 🤑
This looks so good!
Meh
Okay. My anxiety has lessened. I think I’m okay with the passing of the reins.
Hey look, it's the original house right?
I can just tell that ether the killer is her mom her dad or they bring a OG back Cuzz if there is a fucking lame killer eg a new carector wtf is the point then   Ok guys just rewatched it I can 60% say that it’s stu as the killer idk if there’s a second one but I feel like it’s just stu   Ok second edit 1:51 is stu’s house so there is a garentee like between them MABY it’s stu’s parents as the killers ??? Dw guys IM ON THIS
I think scream 5 is gonna be like Halloween 2018
Now this is how you do a GEN-Z remake!
Wazzzzzup!
Looks good and serious, hate when horror movies try to sneak in bad comedy wherever they can
THE CHILLS I GOT BECAUSE OF THIS TRAILER.
i'm calling it the killer is related to billy or stu it's pretty obvious
Looks good! Looking like a good family night scare movie. hehehe
FREAKING AMAAAAZING!!!
NOT JENNA ORTEGA , NO PLEASE DO NOT LET HER BE THE FIRST KILL 😞
LET’S F*cking go!!  Sidney better survive!
The scream queens just keep comin' back
WTF???you okay? you should answer it.how did you know my lindline was ringing amber. Stop that I am not amber alert
Yeah
I am so ready!!! Love ya Syd.
Wait a tick...is that the hippie from Once Upon A Time In Hollywood who got burnt to a crisp?
this looks like literally any average horror movie
oh yes
This is giving me the vibes I wanted from Scream 4 that I just didn't get! WOW
Looks good ngl
Hello Drew ....
Hmm, I think Dewey dies in this one based on 2:01...   ...either that or he gets stabbed in the back and survives like he always does.
Pfffft
I am not okay right now 🥲
wehey, actually looks a lot better than the last few! Seems a bit darker!
Man Jenna Ortega can’t die that early
Cannot wait to see a scream movie in theaters. Ive waited my entire life for this!
Now we need a new skin in dbd after this movie XD
I hope they didn't forget the first rule of reboots.  "Don't mess with the original." -Sydney (Scre4m)
I mean, ya, it’s not bad, a lot more thrilling than the last one. I’m excited for the rush of actions, but it seems less sexy than I thought they were going for. Basically lined up a whole group of people’s kids that don’t flow as easily with the original characters. I like the boy/girl ratio & body count, but I don’t think I’ll get to be as interested in them. Some scenes might turn out to be boring & predictable, but they’re still doing what they do best & it’s definitely a must-see along with Halloween Kills.
OMG
Huh... Okay, we'll see.
This looks SICK
It’s Hicks
Should've revealed him before they got the exposed status effect.
Hell yeah!!!
Poor Clay jensen
another scream movie! the last scream i watch was scream 3!!
"Hello sidney.." we haven't heard that iconic line since 2011
I get horror comedy vibes the 1st half of the trailer
Yes vanessa show them what they messing with. (In the heights)
Can't believe a new one is being made. How long since the last one was made. Glad they made a new one I will see it but problem is it was released in January since people always say January movies aren't good.
Is this a sequel to scream 4 or to the original scream?
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
is this a reboot
I can’t fucking waittttttttttttttt
Scream Five!!! Looks exciting. I grew up watching these movies.
I like Scream but just the one... Im really scare. Pls be good.
me wondering why it's not funny  then remember it's not scary movie
Wazzzuuuppppp
this is a reboot
Would Roman be considered one of the original killers, or just Billy and Stu?🤔
Amazing! Come on Sidney, Gale and Dewey!😍😍😍✌🏾💪🏾
THIS BETTER BE GOOD. been waiting for this for like half a year
NOBODY MOVE!!!
Something tells me that according to a fan-made picture that a enemy from their past has come back or possibly survived and wants revenge. I think that Scream 5 should definitely be the end of the series ending it once and for all. I can also picture that when they release a scream Saga DVD series it should either be split in two parts of the ghostface mask or perhaps the signature knife he uses it's like the handle is the first movie which explains it a little the two sequels are a little bit of the knife 4 is a longer but not so long version of the knife and then five is the tip of the knife. Sometimes a film series has to come to an end and the only way to end this movie is either the death of the hero or the villain
looks shit lmao
this is a reboot
I mean I genuinely enjoyed the MTV series
Can't wait
They made Arquette look like a badass in this one. Finally he has turned all grizzled & cool. Can’t wait, looks brutal
OMG LOOKS SO GOOD
Bullshit. Who has a landline anymore?
nooblets. learn how to loop him.
Who has landlines in 2021 LOL
Looks like the kills are gonna be the most brutal yet...and I'm here for it!
I am so excited for this movie, only 3 months away. Also hoping to see Matthew Lillard back in a cameo as Stu.
HY SINDY
Finally old enough to go see a Scream movie in theaters! "It's an honor." :)
POV: You’re watching this for the 200th time today
This one looks so GOOOOOOD
Is it to obvious that Jenna Ortega is the opening kill. Or is it trying to miss lead us
Calling it now, Jack Quaid is the killer
im sorry but i can't take this movie seriously
I’m READY 😭😭😭
This looks better than I was imagining. Hope it turns out as intense as it looks, the original is one of my all time favourite films.
Will this finally be the one where dewey is revealed as the mastermind
Mine house we don't have a landline
OMEGA BETA ZETA NO I SAID SYDNEYYYYYYYYYY
00:25 me leaving my house for work in the morning
Let it fucking die not another fucking one
Damnnnnn wasn’t expecting to get most of the original cast to come back
"Hello Sidney, its an honor.." every hair on my body stood up
I'l call it Scream 5 anyway
WHAAATSSSS UUUUUUPPPPP
Hello Sidney
Siento que morirá Marley Shelton, no quiero quieroooooo.
THIS IS LOOKING GOOOOOD BABY. HALLOWEEN 2018, HALLOWEEN KILLS, AND NOW SCREAM. SLASHERS ARE KING, AND SLASHERS ARE BACK.
My boy is back!
To be fair of all the reboots that make sense in this day of cellphones and technology. Ghostface would fit right in. Just make him a scary hacker slasher
sala isse scary to Tatya Bichoo hai
Yes
Oh me vengo
"I'm Sidney Prescott , of course I have a gun"  She's gotta point. She's an ICON, she's a LEGEND, she is the MOMENT ,now c'mon now!
Another Scream movie?..... Hollywood is really out of ideas
FUCK YES!   I know where I will be on Jan 14th!!!
Nothing unusual.
Wow
At some point, you just have to ask, how many times can the same thing happen to the same person...
Did anyone get goosebumps
B tier michael myers
Hello Sidney it's an Honour
When just answering a phone is seen as something strange, kids these days! 🤦🏻‍♂️
So when they say that there is a connection with their past, are they talking about the original murders?  Because if they are, does mean they are going with the 3rd killer theory?
I feel like they showed a little too much as far as deaths. But I’m hoping they are throwing us off with the marketing.
The moment this movie comes out Ima be watching it mf ima rent the whole theatre for all I care jus so no one interrupts the movie for me
Looks brilliant looking forward to seeing it wow bring it on I say
I’m sooooo ready for this!!! Definitely a fan of the #Scream franchise!! Let’s gooooo!!!
Why'd they age up all the original characters? Other than that, you have done justice to the greatest franchise ever made.
to me tremendo todo com febre ansiedade panico
Mark my words. This gonna be the worst one yet. Like pls just stop making more of these.
$100 on they’re a relative of Stu’s.
This trailer was good, but there’s one thing that worries me, Gale running towards the ambulance, and I feel like it’s Dewey in there. I will be very much sad if any of the original characters die.
AYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I guess they haven't run the franchnise into the ground enough yet.
Although I'm excited for this there's one issue I have and that's the title of this movie. Movie industry can we stop with this pretentious soft reboot trend by naming the most recent entry the same as the first movie when it's a continuation of the series. Call it something else: Scream 5, Scream 2022, Scream the new generation, the return of Ghostface, the meta film, Sidney kicking Ghostface ass again. Anything but the first title. It's stupid and silly. Stop trying to confuse everybody.
Trouble always follows Clay Jensen. Smh
They're gonna run this series into the ground aren't they? Neve said she liked the script, so I still have hopes, but we'll see.
Yo Guys Ghostface of Scream is officially an Operator in Cod Cold War/ Warzone
I feel I’ve watched toooo many parodies to think this is legit 😂😂🥰
That midnight showing better be like the Stab movies minus the murders
I have my money on the legend herself Sidney Prescott is the ghost face.
Let's see... Billy Loomis (her ex), Mickey Altieri (her friend), Roman Bridger (her brother), Jill Roberts (her cousin). I wonder who's next?  If the killer is not related at all with Sidney Prescott then that would be a first.
yas yas yaaaaaas
I’m glad too see this being remade I never got to see the original
Why did you give away the first kill I’m still so hyped though 🔥🔥
I'm 18 I cant believe I am finally going to be able to watch scream on the big screen
Ngl the January release date concerns me
Dewey got his limp back!
can we have a wassssuppp in this too!
Saw the first Scream in the theater my senior year of high school… just saw the 25th anniversary showing.  I’m beyond excited after a 10 year hiatus for this sequel!   “I’m Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun” 🤣 brilliant
Sidney baby!!!
Yesssss
Great another sequel titled the exact same as the original. God I hate this trend.
It's a scream movie, 99%chance of their being 2 killers lol
I hope Nick Gage is playing the villain in this one. Death by broken lightbulb.
CANTTTTTTTT WAITTTTTTTT!!!!!!!
IM SIDNEY PRESCOTT, OF COURSE I HAVE A GUN.  LEGEND 🖤
I like how they recreated the first scene in the movie, a homage to the original. Im excited 🔪
The trailer looks promising. I'm very excited about this one. Can't trust anyone.
So instead of et girl gets stabbed it’s Disney xd girl gets stabbed  okay
Now we need a other Scary Movie
Not gonna lie, wasn't that great of a trailer. Hopefully film itself delivers and they have misdirected us a lot with this.
Oh yes 🙌 I’m going for a run 🏃‍♀️
I need Shawn wayans in this as Ray😫
It looks good a actually!
this is going to be... SICKKKKKKKK
IVE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS😭
I wish this movie was directed by wes craven as well, he was the master of horror
The title pitch: “ok guys it’s the 5th scream movie taking place after scream 4 what do we call it?” The Studio: “Scream”
Dewey go bye bye in this one
Let scream again
0:23 oh damn, it’s jigsaw! (Pleas this is a joke, don’t take it seriously)
the longest wait for a movie i was 9  now i’m 19
“Would you like to play a game, Tara?” **Billy laugh stops**
Any Ghostface mains on DBD?
My moneys on Usnavi being the killer
49 seconds in and already too much spoiled. Nope, not watching
I paused @2:02 we can see samantha possibly stabbing the maskless killer?
I AM SO READY!
It looks a little bit generic but I'm still looking forward to it for January.
Mixed feelings honestly, I dig ghost face but involving the more digital aspect is kinda cringe.
It's just exactly the same shit as the first 4 films honestly how many times does duey have to get stabbed in these films
It looks good might go see it
*Im hyped for this.*
This and halloween cannot wait.
Dewey is probably gonna die. Like always, my favorite characters die.
Can we stop this shit I keep thinking every time a new one comes out thank god Dewey got out alive, and now we are endangering his life again.
YES!!!!
Ok... this looks good. I am officially hyped for the movie.
IM SCREAMING - GET IT 💅😩
The hype train is a Goooo… 🔥
Woke up and watched this before I did anything! Would an awesome way to start my day as a SCREAM fan.
1:37 Cmon, ur gonna kill the one in the wheel chair?…Well, then again, so did Jason, Freddy, and Leatherface. Nice to see they don’t discriminate and everyone dies.
I cannot wait. Young cast being being chased, taunted and slashed in a small town, full of plot-holes, bad decisions and unbelievable physics is always movie magic for me. I’m in. Also the OG Cast even more so in!!! Let’s goooo!!!
Omg I’m hyped
Scream series is so overrated
god this looks terrible
Quick Question: Was the Ghostface mask made only for film before it became popular? Because I used to have a Ghostface mask before I discovered the film.
Didn’t expect Jenna Ortega to be the Casey of the movie. Also Ghostface is totally Stu!!
FUUUUUUUCCCCK YESSSSSSSSSS
Spoiler alert:   The killer is Stu's ex girlfriend's cousin's former roommate.
MY. HEART.
YES. Ghostface is back!
Wait a minute. What is Monica doing here?
Make SCREAM Scary again!!
Boring, sry
Why in the fuck it’s called only Scream, is it that difficult to put a 5. I’m tired of the new sequel named as the first one, like Halloween 2018
OMGGGGGG I'M FREAKING OUT
That’s Phinn from Spider-Man miles morales 💯
Nope. I'm not doing this, I know this will be mediocre at best. Take it back come up with an original idea. I'm not doing this. Scream is played out and you can make different movies, it done.
Yes, God, yes! Stop doing stupid reboots, this is what we want!
Ready or Not was an amazing surprise. This film is in good hands, Fingers crossed
Anyone else have tears in their eyes afterwards? No? Just me? This looks so good! Ahhhh! It's a Scream baby!!
Looks incredible!!! Wow
Damn, I’m about to be 42. I was almost 17 in 1996, when the first Scream came out. Rip Wes Craven.
GHOSTFACE!!!!!
Hello Sidney , it’s an Honor #ChillsGoingDownMySpine
Nah.. no way Dewey dies.. Dewey is Scream's equivalent to TWD's Morgan.. "I Don't Die!" 👍💯
Woman: *answers the phone* Ghostface: Hey. Woman: Who is this? Ghostface: Someone that's gonna say one thing. Woman: And what's that? Ghostface: WAZZUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!!!!!
SIDNEY!!!!!!!!
Glad to see the OG "Scream" characters again for the fifth movie! Hyped! What a perfect film to start the year 2022. 👻🔪
WASSUP
FINALMENTEEEE
This has me sooooo hyped I’m now def making a trailer breakdown on it!!😭😭
OMGGGGGGG
This looks amazing!!
I CAN'T BELIEVE WOOOOWWW
This looks fantastic ❤
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Yeahh Ghostface is back!!
WE LOVE THIS
Oh yes 🥰
early.
YESSSSSSSS
I am really hoping the killer is not one of the new people. I hope its someone we know from the other movies. I hope its Stu but I'm sure it won't be. This has really got me intrigued and wasn't that Stus house that they showed?
been wating for this SOOO LONG YES!
This legit looks good AF!!!!
This looks badass! Can’t wait to watch it🙌🏽
Weird that it's just called scream, looks good though.
Another classic that will be ruined
This is shit
0:45 she should’ve ran spine chill.
I have a feeling Dewey doesn't make it. :/
F*CK YEAH LETS GO!
"THIS JANUARY" yeap this movie is gonna suck.
Scary again…
Dewey dying would make the most sense this time around. Him giving out the “Rules to Survive a Horror Movie” may be foreboding. Randy was the keeper of the rules, and we know how that turned out.
WOOOOOOOOO
Oh yeah!! it's a Scary Movie!!!!!
damn that looks fantastic.
THIS LOOKS SO GOOOD OMFG!!!!!
Where is our girl KIRBY
Man if Jenna Ortega does in the beginning 😤
It's Amber
Can not wait😍🙏🏻 Love SCREAM❤️❤️❤️
Sir, can't we make a movie without a landline? Why would you even ask that? Don't you ever ask me a question like that, damn it!!! Will this movie kill Sidney or retire her or is Neve doing Scream 7 at 70? Just asking, I am still watching. Horror fan right here. I enjoyed Scream 4, not great but fun so this looks pretty good though miss the old Ghostface voice.

Wooow, I got chills...can't wait for this!
SCREAM 😱😍🥰
Idk if it's just me but i'm loving the fact that classic slasher films are making their way back!
It’s clearly Tobin bell (jigsaw) would you like to play a game 😂😂😂 looks awesome all sceam films are
yawwwwwwn
Jenna Ortega died in First scene really? Scream always doing that, Good actors died in First scene. Im really so excited
how do people find scream scary?
Leave theories down on my comment
Officer Doofy?
I’m not crying u are !!!!!! Omg !!!!!!! It’s going to be a blood bath.
Nothing gets me going more than hearing a new HELLO SIDNEY
This ghostface sounds so brutal. Got goosebumbs  @0.50 when ghostface stands up
Scream 5
So…it’s another Scream movie coming in January. That doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence :/ and also them redoing the opening kill from the first movie but “different”
yes
Wait.. they didn’t bring back Roger Jackson?? His name Is not on IMDB
👍
There is something about this TRAILER that feels different! Something tells me there's more to that intro with JENNA ORTEGA... She's not the first death scene! You cannot have a teaser trailer of SCREAM then give that right away.
3 days after my bday
This is the Scream 4 we should have gotten!!!
Woah. This one is going to be epic. What a great way to start 2022
OMG, THAT IS THE BEST TRAILER EVER, IM SO HAPPY, Even i got a big Shock when i saw the trailer!😱😱😁😀😁😀😁😀😁😀😁😀😍❤😍❤😍❤
LET’S FUCKING GO!!! This looks amazing and terrifying!! (y’all fr give it up with the Stu predictions. that bro is DEAD!)
I just saw it the whole thing. Spoilers: The killer this time is.....              Dewey "the dew" Dewsworth
My first ever horror movie back in 2001 when i was 6 was scream 1 i ever see and this looks soooooo good cant wait ❤️❤️❤️
Why is this not coming out in October though? January really.. Better not kill Dewey either...
idk... I'm feeeeelin a lil woooozzzyy heererreeeeee
I LIKED the video without even Watching the trailer yet because I'm in school and I want to savor the moment And breakdown everything I see, speaking of seeing when I see Sidney I'm gonna Scream!😝😝😝
Se ve bueno y me gusta como fue filmada , se ve fresco.
RIP Wes Craven. Can't wait to see Scream 5 for the first time.
Oh no. That trailer didn’t give anything away, at all. When will studios realize that spoiling movies isn’t nice?
I JUST HOPE THEY DONT FUMBLE THE BALL WITH THIS ONE 🙏🏽
You can already tell who the real killer is, the only person they showed once. “Clay Jensen “ or whatever his real name is. I’ll bet anything he’s the killer
Looks awful... like a cheap, fan-made movie.  Watch the trailer of scream 4, not taking about the movie which was great
FINALLY!
Tbh Dewey looks like a freaking bad ass.
This actually looks really good! I can’t wait! 😱
Looks amazing
Sadly my brother passed away before he could see the last one. I know he would really love this.
I thought this would be a reboot. Seeing the original characters is enough for me to give it a watch.
🖤🔪
AAAAAAAAH
Hello Sidney... It's an honour!
You know what is scary?...  Courtney Cox's face now.
This is a terrible trailer. Im still excited for the movie, but it's not a good trailer. Shows too much of the kills, even the opening one, and too much of the plot
*Heavy breathing* ... *Heavy breathing* ...... *Heavy breathing*
I really think Jack Quaid will be ghostface
I hope they have everyone guns lol
I just wanna point out that Dewey said 3 Attacks not murders so I’m going to assume the killer is just stirring the pot to try and get Sidney back in Woodsboro before starting his murder spree.
Sydney Prescott it's an honor
Im pretty sure Dewey will die. Gale is screaming because of him and i think Marley is driving like a maniac with the sirens on to try and get to him before he dies (in the promo pics released yesterday she has the same shirt on in the house, i think Ghostface gives her a call and tells her what he’s about to do to Dewey)
Sydney is back!
It looks so good
YAAAAAASS
Brutal, amazing,espectacular ! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸🇪🇸👏👏👏👏👏
#screamisback
AMAZING!!
Im so excited
WAZZZUPPPPPPPPPP!!!
I WANT THIS SO BAD
YESSSSS SO LONG
Dose ghost face look scarier in this
I’m worried for Dewey 😨 I feel like this is gonna be his Han Solo at the end of Force Awakens moment 🥺
LOOKS GOOD!!!
Ok ok ok, was kinda worried at first but the fact they said like "This one feels different" and all that. Imma just see how this plays out, it looks great to me at least! Please god we need another good horror movie..
It looks great! I'm so happy we got another scream movie cuz the last one was back in 2011.
People be like: ''omg they made dead by daylight killer a real thing''
Sidney Prescott is my favorite final girl.
I just smiled ear to ear this hole trailer
calling it now , its going to little brother of sydneys high school boyfriend (original antangonist)
I CAN'T WAIT!!! This looks amazing, brb gotta have a scream-a-thon real quick
you poor thing...
5CREAM
Holy shit!!!
Oh fucking mega hyped!!!!!
STUS HOUSE!!!!
I've been through this journey since 1996, I ain't stopping for 2022 either. Hello, SCREAM!
Vamosss!
Now this one makes me excited.
It has the original vibes but I feel this is something else, full of twist yet feels connected to the first one. I.e. something blood related or something like that.  Bring it on Ghostface!!!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
While I'm excited for it, I feel like the teaser gave too much away though.
OMFG I WAITED FOR A LONG TIME!!!
WOW
That was Stu's house from the first movie!
This is gonna be so sick
OH HELL YEAHHHHHHH
Spoilers in the trailer smh
Wellp we now know one of the killers is officially female🤷🏾‍♂️
LETSSS DO IIITTTT 🙌🏻🔮
HELLO SIDNEY ITS A HONOR
2:06 he said the thing! :D
Honestly, I never took Ghostface seriously after watching Scary Movie.
It’s so fucking dumb this isn’t called Scream 5
I’m glad that this looks like it’s going in a more darker and serious tone
Missed opportunity to call it 5cream lol 😪
Finally the best slasher is back 🔥🔥
LETS FUCKING GO!!!!
WAZZUPPPPP
Watching this trailer had my anxiety skyrocket.
can’t wait to download the #SCREAM  trailer immediately, watch it on repeat and analyze every single frame. I can’t believe the day is finally here 😭
I hope somehow they brought back Matthew Lillard as Stu as the killer.
Sidney did not come to mess around AT ALL 🔪
couldnt get a halloween release huh
why remake when the og is good? this is bs.
Calling it now, Dewey is getting killed off this time.
Looks interesting. I appreciate the twists to the format
Scream forever
Holy Fcking Sht!!!!!!!!!! I AM LIVING!!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
OMFGGGGG - "HELLO SYDNEY!" ACTUAL CHILLS. SO FRIGGING EXCITED!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
Ahhhhhh this gonna be good
Hello Sidney it’s a honor. This is gonna be epic.
IsThat knife kinda smaller than the ones from the other movies or am I trippin cuz something about this one just seems different but it still does the same damage and it’s SCREAM❗️ IM EXCITED FOR THIS
anyone else laugh about the door being locked then unlocked then locked again
Last Jedi sucks
On my birthday yay
can’t wait to see the parody for this one
Dont fuck with the original !
He's back ppl😭🔥
This just looks like a remake of the first one
Y A S
Oh wow!!! So much plastic surgery and bad acting! Movie of the year 🤣
Ya know this is kind of implying that this franchise could go to 10+ movies  A copycat Ghostface can literally ALWAYS happen
CHILLS!!!!!!
GHOSTFACE AND SIDNEY IS BACK BABY
LESS humour - MORE HORROR!
"Don't fuck with the originals." That line stuck in me.
LETS GO
January means bad but post covid i dont know but i do know they have to lean into the meta or it will b cringe
YASSSSSS!!!!!!! I have never been so excited!!!! Sidney Prescott! The original badass!  I can’t wait!!!!!!
Daddy Ghost Face is back
Jenna Ortega is KILLING IT
I have a feeling the guy with the longer hair might be Billy’s son… I’m pretty sure that was a rumour a while ago and after hearing that the killer is going after people related to the original killers, it makes sense
Well if the promo still wasn't enough, this teaser all but confirms that Jenna Ortega is the first victim.
Why is this coming out in January, that's the spot they dump bad movies they have no faith in?
😱
Looks amazing
So, the series that started off as a send-up of horror tropes, is now 5 movies old, and is about to release its overly serious, 'gritty' rebootquel
Ok a. They showed a lot more than I thought they would.  B. The killer is stew. Bet!
Calling it now!!! Jack Quaid is the killer
So....is this a Remake or Reboot?
BRU-TAL!!! 😱😱😱😱
"...play a game, Tara" sounds like the killer have a cancer and want to teach about the important of living...
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Ghostface is back baby
Thanks for giving away a decent kill
Oh my Godddddd
Been waiting all night for this preview!
LETS GOOOOOO
Should have been February 14
I bet you STU IS THE KILLER I BET MY LIFE ON IT
So its the same plot as Halloween
"Its an honor" yeah that line is a big deal this means ghost face is someone Sydney has yet to meet yet but it's always someone you no right?
YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YESSSSSS
Yesssss!!!!
All I’m saying is he/she flipped his/her knife in the last scene just like stu did👀
This movie looks awesome and while I’m sad that it ain’t Wes Craven directing it (rest in peace sir) I’ve gotta say the directors have certainly gotten his style down and it’s clear how inspired they are from him, having Neve back as Sydney is always cool and having Courtney and David return even though they broke up irl shows their love and dedication of the characters, so yeah I’ll definitely be there day one to see this
Gracias por esta nueva película!!
YEEEEEEEEESSSSS!!!!!
I wont can take this movie seriously I watched to much Scary Movie
I’m excited! This looks great!
is it stu ?
Hello Sidney 🎬😱🔪 it's an honor!
DOOFY GILMORE is BACK!!!
Yesssssss!!!!!
Randy should've never been near that van.  He would've had so much to say about this.
That's Stu Machers house 😬
Looks way better than Scream 4!
Let's go!!!!
Let’s fucking go
Love the trailer, but by the looks of things Jenna Ortega’s character dies first.
Wow finally!!! I can’t wait to see the movie!!!  😱😱😱 Ironic this is my favourite scary movie 😅😂👌🏻
I did not realize David Arquette’s voice got deeper over time.
This looks AMAZING 🔪🩸🔥
let’s f!cking gooooooo!! 😂😂👻🔪🖤
Just hook it directly to my veins 🤤🤤
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS OMGGGGG
Hello, Trailer… it’s an honor.
bro as soon as i saw the beginning i was sooo hoping they wouldn’t pull a Drew Barrymore on Jenna Ortega but istg it so looks as if they are and i’m pissed bro i really wanted to see her in this movie 😭😭
Yes babeeeeeeee !!!! After a decade I’m so happy it’s finally back 🖤
screaming
Amazing!! Can't f*cking wait for this one 🎉👏🏻🎊😻  After 10 years believeing we had seen the last of this franchise, I'm beyond grateful we are getting a new one, + Ready or Not was perfect so this team knows what they are doing 👻 Now Scream 6 please 🤞🏻
As if.
I’ve been a fan all of my life. I get literal chills knowing this’ll be the first scream movie I get to experience with its first release
😎
No mam#n Ya la quiero ver!!! Será un reinicio? Según las reglas de las películas de terror O será algo nuevo O tal vez el asesino es uno de los 3 protagonistas, que traumado por lo que vivió decide atacar a gente relacionada con los asesinos originales? Aquí no sé si se refiere solo a Billy y Stuart o a todos los asesinos de las 4 películas anteriores. Creen que alguno del trío de oro muera, tal vez Sidney? O que si tiene éxito planeen una nueva trilogía? Ya la espero con muchas ansias  P.d. insertar meme  -Valió la pena la espera? -Que si valió la pena? Valió cada maldito segundo
bruh i thought this was a comedy series
looks amazing
Why do I only remember scary movie parody  right now Wassßsssssssuuuuuuuuppppp.
Jenna aka Tara’s the first one to get killed naurrr 🔪😭
Pro: Radio Silence are being faithful to the original, while doing something new. Con: It's a January release...
What's your Favourite Scary Movie?
OMG IT LOOKS SO GOOD 😭😭😭😭
Haters : After so many years , you are still alive . The Scream Franchise is reborn 🔥🔥
The intro omg 😱
Finally. A horror movie that's not dumb ghosts
Hell yes 🔥
SCREAAAAMMMMM
AAAAAAAAHHHHH
I can't stop watching it I can't wait!!!
Woohoo!!!!!!
idk bout this one tbh. The other ones were great, but I'll be interested to see what happens.
I cannot wait until 2022 OMG
Dioooos ya quiero q sea enero 😱😱😱😱😍😍😍😍
I Think This Movie Will Show When Halloween Comes
This is simply a.. “preview of coming events”.
hellyeah make Craven proud guys
Actually looks good and definitely looks like its more serious and dark compared to the other scream films damn ghostface stomping and breaking legs damn that's what I want a brutal more serious ghostface not one that's falling over or getting backflipped.
So the director said that the cast got like 5 different scripts so they wouldn’t know who the killer is, which is awesome. And it doesn’t give away a lot of kills like Halloween kills did
This looks amazing I really wanted to know who the fuck was on fire in stus kitchen in one the scenes omg this looks brilliant they didn’t disappoint with this🔪
scream  5 ,Please 6 ?..💀
YES DEWEY AND GALE!!
That cast though!!! 😍 Can't wait!
Looks fun!! I hope that opening scene isn’t like scream 4 tho cuz it looks similar
Something about this is different....it's a soft reboot
This movie is gonna be so good I’ve got chills i miss randy tho 🤗
It looks so good I can’t wait to watch it in the movie theater
Perhaps Billy Butcher spoiled the ending in The Boys. "You're a fucking killer Hughie"
Modern Problems Require Modern Solutions
I'm glad that it's not a remake, been done so many times already lol. Looks modernized and good!
Poor Clay Jensen. I guess he just wasn't destined to have a normal High School life...
Woah!!!!
thank you. I'm dying!! finally is here!!
Sidney aged well.  I hope this slasher film doesn't disappoint cos they don't like to make gorey slasher films anymore
This looks like any other Scream flick. 🥱🥱🥱
GAAAY SCREAMING*
I've fallen and forgot how to get up and run again!
👻👻👻
Let’s go they are keeping up the storyline and this movie seems a lot fun
“I’m Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun”   The OG final girl I can’t wait
absolutely worth the wait.
I’ll be there opening night!!! 🔪
CADÊ OS BRASILEIROS MILENNIAIS  ?????
Scream is my favourite franchise of all time, I am so beyond hyped for this!! No disrespect but four was ummm, pretty bad so this looks like what a Scream film should be once more   Let's goooooo <3
IT’S A SCREAM BABY!!!! 👻👻👻👻👻
OMG I CANT WAIT , ITS BEEN TOO LONG
So you’re telling me Jenna Ortega dies in the 1st scene? Better not be true.
After Tara gets cut the first time and GF unlocked the security system, i switched forward haha. Dont want myself get spoiled too much. But damn, this movie will gonna be epic. Looks similiar and different in the same way. Probably bcs the tone is much much darker this time. Im hyped
You really have to notice the lil things like the way the mackenzie girl shifts her neck like the killer
Whazzzzzzzzaaaaaap?  Wait wrong ghost face
Halloween 2021 has officially begun! 🎃🗡
Think the beautiful girl with the pink hair who is Liv McKenzie is one of the killers.  Didn't show a lot of her in the trailer but just enough to be suspicious
THIS IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE
Make Wes Craven proud. That's all I ask.
Looks old, tired and pretty crap.
GhostFace killer is back .
Lets gooooo I'm so freaking hyped Scream is back!!!!
"I'M FEELING A LITTLE WOOZY HERE"
“Hello Sidney it’s an honor” I KNOW THAT’S RIGHT 🙌🙌🙌🗣
“Do you like scary movies?”   *We’ve waited so long for those words to be said*
I watched the first scream film when it came out as a teenager and ill be 40 when this one comes out... as sad as it may sound for a woman of my age, I am so excited about this film coming out that I could p*ss myself! (Sadly not that uncommon at my age :-D)
OMG😍😍😍😍
I hope the Killer's motive is more personal this time around. The Killer's motive in Scream 4 was more out of greed than personal.
Whoever cut this trailer should be fired ASAP!
Calling it, Ghostface Lillard.
0:44 - they got inspired by the hallowe’en 1978 scene when Michael Myers appears behind Laurie
Hell ya
Hello Sidney, it's an honor💙
IT'S SHERIFF DOOFY!!
YOOO LETS GOO!!! I can’t wait for Scream 5!
Now is this Canon to the other movies too or just a direct sequel to the first one?
The revolution will not be televised
Yeah!!!!
Yes Finally...🔥🔥
This looks awesome. I know the original film way too well and i can't wait for this one. I'm seeing this next year for sure.
YES!!!!
Thanks a lot Paramount for ruining smart devices.
Wow, 2021 and 2022 is gonna be horrifying!  That Chucky Show  Friday The 13th lawsuit finally over  Texas Chainsaw Massacre Movie in development  and now Scream 5!
❤️❤️😍😍
Hello Sidney…I’m here for the *RENT* money  Edit: 0:32 - 0:39 with security like that, I really need to fix those damn doors
cast is great
Cant take it seriously anymore after scary movie. WAZAAAAAAAP My favorite comedy
It's more like 25 years and Ghostface still can't kill Sidney lol
What is wrong with Paramount for releasing this in January??
Sim sim siiiiim aaaaaaaa delícia
@1:32 😁😁😁
Hughie just needs to call Homelander and your Ghostface Killer problems are solved in seconds 😂😂
This is just a remake of Stab 3
One of the OG 3 might not make it but on the other hand, one of the OG 3 could be the killer
So, Gale is screaming and crying... R.I.P. Dewey u.u
Ooh, this looks really good! I already interested in it, but this trailer got me looking forward to it more! Can’t wait!
I've just watched the trailer 6 times already. As a day one Scream fanatic this trailer gave me chills. I can't wait for this! This movie is going to bring me back to the theater. There's no way I will be able to wait to watch. I saw the first 3 in theater so this will be so nostalgic for me.
Only 45 seconds in and I’m getting chills and super excited
noiccce!!!
OH MY GODDDDD - I jumped out of my skin. Seems like they've dialled down the humour and gone for darker scares and I'm here for it! SCREAM 1 VIBES! counting the days
Someone point me in the way of the Spanish version just so I can hear "Hola Sidney"
SO EXCITED
“The attacks are on people who were related to the original killers” WOW! So everyone that dies or is attacked are related to previous killers. THIS IS FRESH! That’s why Sidney said the roles have changed.
Omg I’ve waited ten years for this . So beyond excited. My film of next year. Love the Cast Love the Directors . Love EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS. LETS HAVE IT!!!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Lets hope this is a Scream 1/2 not a Scream 3/4 🤣
I miss that "Hello Sydney" phone call. I wonder when will he calls me.
Of course Sidney Prescott would be a fine ass chick jogging in the park these days 🤓🩸💀🔪
So, my guess is if the killer is hunting those related to Billy and Stu, the killer is a relative of one of the victims from the first film.  They will also be after Sydney because she's (in people's minds) to blame for those events, Dewey was a cop and didn't stop the killers, and Gale profited off the murders and glorified the events.  Just a thought.
I’m sorry I can’t take this movie seriously after scary movie
Yay this isn’t going to be like every horror remake ever and it’s totally not going to be nostalgia bait
Im excited for scream 2022🔪🩸😁😍
Sidney has a gun! you better let them know!!!!
It IS an honor!
this looks so good 😱
Omggggggggg yessssss!!!!!
I want to see the prequel to this so I can see what happens to Courtney Coxs characters face
So excited !!!!!
Wow that opening scene seems terrifying. Her performance seems really promising too. I can’t wait.
YESSSSSSS
Did you see Gail's face? Dooey might die
To this day I still think Dewey is in on that shit
Doofy is Ghostface
Omg yessssss looks soooo god im so excited
Hell yea im hype the og's better not die though
So. Much. Excite.
YES YES finally! AAAAAAA love the franchise and can’t wait to have the 5th one in my Scream collection!
What's you're Favorite Scary Movie! 🔪
Finally
“Something about this one just feels different”.... ☹️
Holy shit so Jenna Ortega is our famous death of the movie!!
I really hope it’s Stu as ghostface
oh my god???
Good trailer.
I know it's just the trailer and can be deceiving but this one appears to be more serious and "horror" than the prior two films which were almost borderline comedies. I can't wait.
Something about RANDY MEEKS... The two black kids have their roles a name as MEEKS-MARTIN. Check IMDB.
Roger L. Jackson is the man.
I would like to argue that Scream franchise is the only horror franchise with no stinker. Fingers crossed here! Also just want to point out how NOT diverse the cast is and I like it. Sick and tired of forced group of diverse ethnicities and genders in films nowadays. Make a good film and I will respect that.
Oh boy
Idk about this one!
Hello Sidney. >:)
January can’t come fast enough!
This legit looks like a great modern update of the series!!
it’s the best time to be a horror movie fan. 🔪
IT FEELS LIKE CHRISTMAS TODAY IM SO DAMN HAPPY
Oh poor Jenna Ortega, looks like she'll be the opening kill
Pass
god sidney & laurie just can’t catch a break
JUST WATCHED IT!!!!! AW SHIT!
Omg this is my fav movie ever I can’t wait to see the new one
Hell yeah anyone else notice that they return to Stu’s house from the first film.
Follow the Rules. So excited
You can have my entire bank account. Take it!
Oh yeah baby! Lets gooooo!!!!
Was that stu’s house?
Where’s Selena Gomez?
Yessssssssssssssssss 👻🔪🧡🤩
SCR5AM
I can't believe the spoilers! Opening kill revealed like that. 😬
This is exactly what i needed this morning.
I've never been so scared of a freaking trailer holy shit.
ok, cool, but why not call it SCREAM 5? there's already a SCREAM movie titled SCREAM.
Don’t fck with the original
It's disturbing how happy a 2 minute trailer of people dying made me 😂😂 Seriously though, this looks AMAZING 😍
Y'all brought Jenna to kill her at the start?😂 Ik it's Scream tradition but bruh
WOOOOOOOOOO
Let’s fucking gooooo!
Here we gooooo
OMGhostface‼️‼️‼️
Ooh so I wonder if the spoilers I read a few months ago are true: -Dewey, Sidney and Gale are NOT the main characters this time, have minimal screentime and 2 of the 3 will die -Tara (Jenna Ortega) is the opening kill but survives the attack. -Sam and Tara characters are somehow tied to the first Scream
Totally love all the Scream Movies but never would have thought I'd be able to see one in theatres. This looks fantastic. I can't wait 💀🔪
Trailer that gives away too much? CHECK forced diverse cast of mostly unknown millennials? CHECK modern tech being used in an edgy/cliche way? CHECK overly clear digital cinematography? CHECK forced fan service? Check
NEW THEORY. The whole film is just a fantasy either in stu’s head or SIDS head from the nut house
Am I the only one who wants Sidney to be Ghostface at the end?
I’m finally old enough to see a Scream movie in cinemas 😭🙌🏼
So damn excited!
cool
yeah but why
Y’all forgot the first rules of remakes guys, don’t fuck with the original
I HAD MY ALARM SET FOR THIS YESSSSS
😍😍😍😍
Old but Gold..the the voice of Scream is still the same actor..yes!
NOOO JENNA DIES :(
Let’s be completely honest, if Sidney, Dewey, or Gale don’t die in this file they should just stop. I love the franchise, but at this point it’s pointless. They won’t kill them off because 💴
I,m Waiting For This Movie
I'm so glad I watched the scream Movies last year, coz Now I'm More Hyped for Scream 5!!!
Oh no! Now i feel bad for Jenna. Ghostface is terrifying! 😱
After watching this, I have a strong feeling that Stu is actually the killer. Matthew Lillard has been "joking" about it all year long saying his character is not dead. Check out his recent US Weekly interview.
Spoiler warning: It was Dewey all along.
Damn I wanna see it now
YES!! Sidney still the icon!
Let’s fuckin go I’m so excited for this movie 🍿 can’t wait
Monica???
lol
2023
It's an HONOR. Yeah, watching this trailer is an honor !!!!!!
Save me a seat for JANUARY 14th!!  "I'll be right back"
Dewy 😁
It’s fucking amazing!!!!!
I AM SO READY!!!
Just unhappy people can give a "deslike" on a wonderful trailer like this. Its amazing!
Ghost Face is a woman in this one. Definitely. They said "he" too conspicuously.
OMG!!!! YEEEEEEES!!! LOVE IT! Love new approach of new team behind!!!! Scream is in perfect hands! Love old mytology with the new one! Ghostface looks like butcher here. Cant wait!!!
If you dare
Holy fucking shit
lord I excited my aunt (when she was 17) brought me to the theaters to see the first one when I was 3 and then I went to see Scream 4 in theaters when I was 17 and I'm so excited to see this one in theaters too!!! Ps. Happy Birthday to my late Aunt!! We love and miss you!!! And thank you for introducing to this series ❤
not a big fan like @3CFlims is, but looking good
Omg i love it!!!!!
Was it just me or when Ghostface said "hello Sidney " I freaked out so much
YEESSSS!!!! 🔪 🩸 THANK YOU PARAMOUNT!!!!! 👏👏👏 😃🤩😆
Am I crazy or is there a couple shots of Stu’s house from the first Scream film in this trailer??
I HOPE JENNA HAD MORE SCREEN TIME
THE TRINITY ARE BACK !!! 💖🌋🌋🌋💖
About 10 seconds in and here we go with the fucking texts again..
Let’s go!!!!!  🔪🔪🔪🔪🩸🩸🩸🩸
YES YES YES AND A THOUSAND TIMES YES!!!!!
This is One of Those Moments When your just Proud to be a Fan❤️❤️❤️!!!
Gonna be epic #Scream
My mans Dewie feelin different in this one! Lets see him put in some work this time!
It's interesting to note that Jenna Ortega will most likely be the opening kill. But with the way the "Ready or Not" producers wanted to continue Wes Craven's vision it makes sense.  Jenna is like the Drew Barrymore of now. Or well that's how I see it. She was on Disney, and started in Iron Man 3, Insidious Chapter 2, The Babysitter 2, and voices Brooklynn in Jurassic World Camp Cretaceous.  Smart to make her the opening kill. And she was advertised kind of heavily so far, and was like the 1et person to be announced to be in this movie. Very Drew Barrymore
HOLY FUCK THIS LOOKS AWESOME!!! :D
Let’s gooooo
I will watch halloween kills , Halloween ends and scream 5
I doesnt feel the scream vibe:((
The attacks were all on people related to the original killers😮😮
Me to my boss now that tha trailer dropped “I’ll be riiight baaaackk!”
HOLY HECK! That was freaking scary and so damn good!
Best thing to happen in 2022 is this movie coming out im calling it now 😂
BORING - Get some new ideas HOLLYWOOD.
2011:after watching scream 4 wishing there will be scream 5 2021:I have got my own wish
BEST SCREAM TRAILER EVER 😱😱😱
Its very obviously one of their kids. Every one of these late sequels involves offspring of an original cast member it seems... dude cheated with chick, had kid off-screen, grew up without dad and is mad at Sidney and wants revenge. Happy to be wrong.
OMG I've been "Dying" to see this.
I'm 22 and I never got to watch the 4 previous 'Scream' movies in theaters and now that I have a chance to see this new one, I just realized that cinema theaters are still closed in the Philippines 🇵🇭 where I live due to pandemic. 😭 I just wanna see the original trio fight ghostface in theater. I was waiting for that since I was a child. 😭
I need hindi trailer 🇮🇳
🥰😍
😭😭😭😭😭😭
Love From India 🇮🇳
Let's go baby!!! Sid and Gale, pls: survive!!!!!!
Excited but its seems to be showing way too much how dare they kill Jenna's character
Love it, just.....why would you name Scream 5 "Scream"? Like you wouldn't name the 5th Spider-Man movie "Spider-Man" lol
Don't give us any more trailers after this! Let this be the only trailer we get!
Am i the only one who thinks there are too many spoilers in this trailer?
Words cannot express how excited I am for this!! I was in high school when Scream 4 came out, and I’m excited to see another Scream movie in the theatre’s again 🙏🏼🖤☠️🔪
Away we go boys
My favorite horror franchise has returned!!!
OMG!! I love 🔪🔥❤️
Omg not Jenna Ortega character being the first kill!!!
Oh muy good , so excited 🔪❤️
This looks so fucking good!!!!
Looks like Dewey dies or gets really badly hurt.  You him struggling with Ghostface then you see Gale reacting like she's seeing someone she's close to dead while Sydney holds her back.
“I’m Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun.”  I KNOW DAT’S RIGHT!!!!!!!
What's Your Favorite Scary Movie?
Yessssssssssssssssssssss!!!!
Guess Selena Gomez wasn’t the opening victim after all. Now we know it’s Jenna Ortega.
Will an og member finally die
I’m very excited about this movie. Definitely already one of my most anticipated movies of 2022 so far. But u know how horror movies sequels are…… Anyways, I’ll see u in Woodsboro hehehehe
Why she had to die the first scene
Fuck yeaaaaaaaa
This is amazing!!!!!! Also if they did Scream season 3 with original cast it would be double amazing!!!!!!!
Been waiting 10 years!!
Yessssssss can not wait 🔪💀🤘🖤👻
“I’m Sidney Prescott, of course I have a gun.” Put that on my gravestone!!! 😭🙌🏽😭
Dewey looks weirdly badass
🔥🔥
Hold on to your seats, this one’s a SCREAMER!!!
Feels kinda bland
Uff I got goosebumps🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love it!
OMG the OG voice at the end!
Yaaaassss! I’ve been waiting since 6 years ago they said they wouldn’t make this! Lol
Does anyone else also think the biggest mistake  slasher films like this has is they always have unlikeable younger characters you dont really care who dies. Lucky enough they have original cast that will  carry this film.
That's freaking cool !!
this is awesome 🔪🩸
damn that tiktok guy did predict it
Watch this coz of PERRI NEMIROFF!!!
Me: 'So when the hell is Scream coming out??'  Ghostface: 'I'll be right back' 😉😱
Let’s goooo
Yeees!
THAT loooooks so good!🤐😍
NO WAYYYYYYYYY!
Hacker Ghostface for the smart technology era??? Yessss 🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪
In this sad sorry world, there’s only two things you can count on. 1. That up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, start will give you 30 lives on Contra, and number 2 is…  You cannot kill David Arquette!
Finally
I'm Down For This. Giving Me Some Halloween 2018 Vibes.... Love That For This Franchise. I'm Ready To Watch It Now.
Yeah. Looks like it's coming back together... To where it all started... Everybody is a SUSpect...
I mean Dewey has to die in this one. He’s survived in all the other ones 🤔
“the attacks were all on those related to the original killers” 😱 so maybe someone who was related to the original survivors doesn’t want any of the relatives of the killers to snap, so they snap themselves to keep it from happening (like a mrs loomis kinda thing)
The Batman!!!!  Oh wait.
Omggggg I'm so friggggggennnnn excited omg my night is complete 💓
SCREAM TIME!!! So excited for this omgggg!!
Doesn't have the Halloween kills effect of WTF!!! BUT looks good
LESGOOOOOOO 🖤🥂

OMG! They are going to be like counselors. 😮😮😮
Omg I can't wait ahhhhhhhhh , literal chills
I'm shaking. That was intense
Wow absolutely incredible! Can’t wait! Looks like they’re returning to stu’s house from the original, wonder why that is? January 14th needs to hurry up 👏👏👏
oh my god kill me
Scream

THANKS FOR SHOW US THE ENTIRE MOVIE IN THE TRAILER
Eh was expecting more
What did he say at the end after he said “hello Sidney. It’s…”?
Hypee
Still praying that Kirby returns
HE'S ALIVEEEEEE
IT’S AN HONOUR
What’s up with horror movie trailers showing everyone dying in the trailer? Halloween and now Scream? It ruins the suspense.
But wait, there’s more!
HOLY SHIT STUS HOUSE
Oh i'm ready hunny
Yes !!!! #ScreamMovie 🔪🍿😱🎬
Straight up in the beginning it looked like Fan made mini Scream movie someone would make.
oh my god this has shifted away more to action and horror and i crave it!
Meh...
lowkey thinking it’s Dylan minnettes character
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I need more already! Omg do I love seeing how ghostface is now- it looks so amazing I can’t wait to see it this January
I was waiting for this moment 🔪🇧🇷

They shouldn’t have killed off jenna
Part of me really hopes Stu survived the first movie
Marathon Coming Soon!
PASSANDO MAAAAL
damn bro spoil much? shit showed like 3 death scenes
Okay, so early predictions:   I'm guessing Dewey dies, because otherwise Gale and Judy Hicks wouldn't be having a visceral reaction like they are. I'm guessing Sidney is either a detective, or is just well prepared. Love how she's taking on the Randy role.
NAH IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR TOO LONG
EPIC!!!!!
What's your Favorite Scary Movie?...   Might be this one after we see it <3
wait is Jenna Ortega the first one to die??
YO I CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS IN THEATERS NEXT YEAR! #5CREAM LOOKS GOOD 🔪🩸
There's something really scary about a guy with a knife who just... snaps.
there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror reboot.
