If this video doesn't get 500,000 likes, the boys will never let me host again!
Harry’s face at 1:26:10 had me dead
The contrast of Ethan and Harry dive dancing while the cheap team was scared asf getting robbed was hilarious 😂
1:17:44 best xDD 2:58:02 xDD
1:00:00 hammerhead forehead 😂😂
yall are goofy
Harry sniffed the sock 😂
1:51:29 Tf is that bro🥀💔
What do u call harry on a hill surely it's harry hill 😂😂😂
You’re my Holliday
Did I miss some lore on why vik is always in cheap side?
Caspar was class 😂😂😂😂
45:55
goated vedio mate well done
1:16:19 ayo harry
I am to rich for this 😂
Vikk, to be fair though… I liked the bad team’s outfits better.
1:16:19 harry sniffing the sock is wild
Forgot watching the vid, intro isn’t familiar, got a banger rewatch on my hands
can we get some more only skiing videos??
amazing video loved the ending so wholesome
how dare they not vote for vik to change he suffered every time
josh is evil to play with the boys emotions
Adding context to trending clips distinguishes original uploads
Exactly what I was searching for.
Sidemen Finlay mackin look okay YouTube
hätt nie tänkt das ich mal gseh d sidemen hörnli mit ghackets ässe 😭😭
Can we just give a shout to Casper he was an amazing guy in all sidemen vids
Bad
It’s weird seeing THE sidemen ski on the slopes that i skied on for multiple years in a row and call it luxury😅😂
52:09 oh nah Ethan be moving mad
1:00:00 So thats what a forehead pov looks like 😂😂😂
Jj is a little girl.... he rrly is insecure hahah funny but kinda sad
Stop giving ksi good teams we all know he's a diva and thats why he gets preferential treatment but he's fallen off and doesn't deserve it
JJ calling over NPCs on the bus is actually spot on😂😂
I don't think it's cool that the host is trying to get  Harry  drink if he's saying that he doesn't want to drink anymore
14:00 almost got cancelled Ethan
1:00:03 I love how the GoPro or whatever it is is mounted to his forehead and you can still see his forehead
The visuals are just next level.
1:06:03 damn bro called it a year ago xD
Which one would you choose?
I actually learned something new today.
how come ksi always go to the good hoidays
Tobi 2:08:00 ❤
Randol taking about when they are 80 years old remembering the time they had together knowing that some may or may not be there in that age, hits home.  We always remember our last time doing something but never know it’s the last time doing it while it happens.  Live life like it’s the last time you’re going to do something even if it might now be.  I miss the days playing ball with everyone in the neighborhood wish it never ended then one day it just was.
1:40:00
Needs more views this video
This deserves to go viral.
Thanks josh josh is not selfish as vick he made that cozy sleepover my finally a fav part of video
1:37:32 he deserves dont to be in good team
1:34:25 i knew it vik hope for ur downfall
55:42 yaaa vick i knew it u are very jaleous from JJ
39:18 yaaa show ur real vick  Pretty jaleous from JJ
Vikk always complain and make himself show pitiable JJ also get cheap team often, vikram always only mention himself
Pure quality content right here.
1:39:10 feeling sad for vikk
Poor Tobi, He deserves a good trip. 😆
I’m I the only one who thinks the cheap team had a better time, they could have made that bar crawl an absolute blast meet the locals have some drinks play games, rich team oh let’s sit in a posh cabin with the 3 of us and be bored. Get what am saying.
"I can tell my mum I can ski now"... Toby is so wholesome!
Half way through and the "bad team" experience looks FAR superior to me, personally
tobi eating snow  27:38 and drifting
2:16:40 😂😂😂😂
Why alway cheap team makes good content in good vs bad team videos?  Expensive team enjoys the luxury but cheap team the one working for the content.
1:46:05 this shot is unreal
1:00:00 The ksi camera is insane 🤣🤣🤣🤣
WINTERRR
I feel bad for Vikk
1:26:17 😂😂😂
1:11:45 simon is menace to society
1:05:09 wtf why did he punched😂😂😂
5:37  i would kill my friend if he did that nahhhhh
3:02 😂😂
They are lazy to walk up the hill with suitcases
cashpur was sooo awesome 🔥🔥
Josh is actually cruel for this 🤣  Vik just accepting fate
Josh is actually cruel for this 🤣  Vik just accepting fate
THANKS FOR THIS VIDEO!! I WILL GO ON HOLIDAY WITH YOU GUYS SOON!!!
"The crew" man 🤙💖
I want VIK on good team for once. is it too much?
Man i low-key feel bad for vik
bro the fact that the camera man was skiing is crazy
"Its ok, oh its not ok,..ok😂"
I feel bad for vik he didn't get any votes to be on the good team and I wanted him to join so badly he never gets the good team. what does the group have against him?
Video was good till you played chomo music
bruh there's noway my man harry started sniffing the sock
1:15:00 why tf did Harry sniff the sock😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
56:46 harry is wild for this 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That ending wass soooo goood. Especially the bed chat😂😂

Harry sniffed the sock😂
2:16:46 ill just leave this here..
1:18:00 hahahahaha when they troll toby hahahaha
1:04:40 why the man has to be so agressive? you can tell the guy kept coming at Simon before they cut the scene
1:16:19 harry smelling the womans sock, crazy
I was not prepared for 2:16:39, that is a powerful shot 🤣
1:16:19 I love how Harry just smelled the sock
Absolute banger of a video from Josh here 🔥
Casper should be all the talks in the comments, he was amazing.
why is harry being such a buzzkill like somepeople dont even have roof over their heads cheer up
You boys been stacking strain up eh ay? 😂😂😂
1:29:16
14:04
Harry is so whiny in this video and didnt want to do the tasks, but everyone participated in his wheel of fortune with heaps of forfeits that were like torture. 🤦‍♀️
i know it's been a year, baut does someone know how to play the game that both teams were playing in the end pf the video, or atleast how is it called? thx!
Watching this video for 3rd time and I still can't believe no one voted for VIK.
Not a single vote and yet you love vik nice
why is vik always on bad team bruh
I feel bad for Vik, He likes skiing an he couldnt even go, and Vik is the one that gave Ethan the prada snowboard as well.
- The list of tasks that bad team have to do are really childish kinda - Why is the bad team, specially vik complining so hard? cmon so many ppl would love to go on a winter vacation in bad team accomodation - Why are they moving from verbier to chatel to glacier 3000 to verbier? what kind of planning is this? With better planning they could make filming and still have some spare time off camera doing whatever they want. - Why are they inside with their ski clothes on taking the slide etc
The shot of the suspension bridge and when Coldplay hits is EPIC!!!
you are telling me they went to Morzine and I MISSED THEM!! That is where im from!!!! Noooooo!!
where did they go , anyone know?
Why does JJ cut raclette like that, it’s as if he’s never had it. He calls himself rich and he’s never been skiing properly and had fondue and raclette. That’s just  a normal ski holiday, he needs to calm down
A Three hour sidemen Sunday it’s gonna be classic
I was gonna watch an extended Lord of the Rings but I guess this'll do
day 2 was a shitter, not gonna lie
1:16:19 why would you sniff it 😭
This video is longer then some movies still more interesting than movie😂❤️
Goated video
😂😂😂😂
14:00
1:14:38 Pov your being drowned by Ethan Payne
Every one of these videos I see Harry gets shafted LOL
Come back to this vid just for the intro sometimes
1:16:17 harry smelling the sock is willlddd 😭
Vik deserves so much better😢
Awww poor vik🥺
2:19:04 okayyy jumpscare
The bad team seems so much fun tbh
omg Cashpur is the originator of Ashton Hall 1:47:30
1:29:13
harry so would've enjoyed that slide 😂
2:16:40 I’m dying 💀😭😭
1:00:34 ethan adjusting the camera angle is insane
54:16 vik was upto something
0:52 stoke song
33:30 Wotah Atom 😂😂
this is the best movie
Harry calling JJ a runt 😂😂😂😂😂
Is it me or is jj just an overgrown toddler
2:16:42 😂😂😂
Truly Good Or Bad Team, Both places are extraordinary to me. The view they both had was beautiful. Awesome Video bro #SDM #JOSHLITASF
Harry must be exhausting to be around.
No😂
We need another expensive v cheap holiday again soon!
I hope Casper got that cigar . I mean the mountains are so beautiful and he's throwing a cigar on it
3 hours of pure entertainment
Nah that ski instructor was mad
As a german, the ski instructors german hurt very bad😂
well they werent kidding when they said they were praying on KSI's downfall lmao
One of the best video❤
Tell Josh that I want one of these videos every year 🔥
Bro stalled for time saying we need to make bed content 😂
Bro made Simon's joke real 😂
Ksi calling the fans NPCs 😂
Ksi on the bus 😂
Casual binge rewatch of the holiday videos
1:01:37 hahaha this edit is wild
It’s mad that no one voted for Vik. That’s mental.
1:46:16 🐕Cute
that ski instructor working overtime for jj 🤣🤣
jj doesnt llike water well well well
this is more entertaining than any movie fr
Boys I know this is an old vid but I swear to god Harry smelt that ladies sock 😂
Look at their faces 45:21 😭
7:32 - Jj was too damn hilarious😂😂
31 ads is crazy
1:18:00   My last two brain cells when I try to study

✝🤨Jesus speaks about eternal perdition:😮😵 Mark. 9: 43 to 46. And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than to have two hands and go to destruction,👺 into the unquenchable fire,❤🔥 where their worm does not die.🤬 And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into the unquenchable fire, where their worm does not die. This hand and foot that Jesus mentions are things and facts that make a person scandalized and not want anything to do with God anymore. 🤔😐 Ex. A pastor was caught stealing tithes💰💰 from the church, the guy says he is a believer but look what he does! 🤣😂 If we are scandalized by these things and no longer want to serve God, we will go to perdition just like the other one will later, there is no other alternative. 😵🥵 Accept Jesus as your only and sufficient savior, read the Bible, come to an evangelical church; tomorrow may be too late! 😩😫
Knew that ethan would be good,he has asthma
Vik always gets done dirty
ANYONE IN 2025????????🎉😂
1:51:00
1:10:22  52:44
That was some made tongue moment Ethan
Nah man harry did a smell test with the "woman’s sock” too 😭💀🤚 1:16:20
The cheap outfits look way sicker than the expensive teletubbie outfits imo
Vik dressed like the transgender flag
they went right past my apartment in Verbier
This did not need to be 3 hours tbh
one of my favourite videos, the ending was so sweet
i love how it's jj, vik and simon bored and scared in the cabin and then it cuts to harry and ethan doing synchronised swimming
“They don’t know everyone on the bus is an actor” sure that’s why public shy ksi jumps around screaming and shouting I’m too rich for this 👍
Stop putting like 50 ads on every sidemen video, I can't even watch 5 minutes without ads popping up.
1:16:18 why did harry smell the sock
2:16:40 to 2:16:50 was one of the funniest parts
i lost 20 braincellls in that WOOW clip LMAO
1:39:33 Best part after rewatching.
Toby an ksi is like a mom with a grumpy boy
Simon always thinks that they are going to be the good teams butlers. I have heard him say that in so many cheap vs expensive videos
14:17 🤣🤣🤣
that is so carzyy
Should do a 20k vs 20k holiday and neither team knows whos the bad team
M’y friends mother actually owns the « Bad » Teams Place but the sidemen only showed the bad parts of it
1:16:19 NO HARRY NO, NOT ON CAMERA YOU DIRTY DOG YOU
1:17:36, is KSI a tornado siren?
“GET ME OUT IM TOO RICH FOR THIS” 😭
you boys are stacking strain up ay ahhaahhahahahahahah vik's so random I love it
Oh, how I'd love to be on holiday and run into half the Sidemen, who then shut down your offer of drinks, to buy you a round.
its Samsung you idiot its the best phone in the world
So nobody’s gonna talk about Harry sniffing that sock!!😂❤
1:16:19 anyone see that
2:25:06
How is jj so weak and no fit and not athletic, he was supposedly a boxer. Cant even do monkey bars and cant even sled.
Does it bother anyone else how they all like like such spoiled people
1:29:41
42:19
40:15
I love how they cut from simon vikk and jj being anxious to harry and ethan doing flips in a pool lmao
is it just me but i don''t like the way jj treated the bus tour people
Casper is the best guest
What an intro Man!
1:18:19 Ethan is a legend 😂😂😂
There prayer surely came true
1:15:03 is gorgeous btw
Damn, as soon as Vick said domain expansion, KSI started
2:16:41 what you see moments brf a NPC Titan eats you
Ive watched so many of these videos of you guys, and the best thing about this video is how ethan and jj are paired in the same team, they might have their differences but in this video you can see the love between them. A lot of love for all the sidemen and p.s. i took part in JJ’s welcome to beast challenge a decade ago, i followed your youtube from the beginning big respect for what you have all accomplished. Im also a member at Royal Birkdale GC and would be happy to take Harry, Simon and Josh because they are actually decent at golf before the open championship 26
Best bit 2:16:40
why is vik always bad team
Who's all here ? 😊
jj is so detached from reality its not even funny
1:16:19 your not getting away with that one harry i saw you sniff the sock 🤣☠️
That bridge looks so god damn cool but I could never do it
Ethan22 is such a hater
JJ reminds me of Terry Crews in white chicks 😂 38:10
Harry looks like a German 😂😂😂😂
Sky instructor absolutely killed me, listening to it while trying to not wake the household and can’t stop chuckling like some sort of happy stout
Lol 2:16:40
2:16:36
Simon wanted to cry
Poor Vik 53:05 i loved the idea bro
The look on the chefs face ✨🤌
Vi.                                                         🎚️📡🎚️⏱️⏱️📸⏱️📸🔋🪫🪫📽️🪫🧯⏰⏰📺. K fn
JJ calling a person an npc thenEthan wheezing is halarious
U violated that guy on the bus 🤣 ‘Why is that NPC asking for a picture’ 🤣🤣 burst out laughing at him, poor fella 😂🤣🤣
1:56:49
kasper is so real
10:07 IS THAT VLAD IS THAT VLADIMIR  PUTIN
Absolutely amazing video
Vik on the good team...CMOON. Ethan on bad team...Ethan is always on the good team. I wanna see Ethan suffer 😂
Is that ksi with a vape???
Cant lie i prefer the blue teams outfits
1:18:55 the guy waved goodbye to vikstar
Nah I seen Harry sniff that sock after 😂 1:16:19
Seriously whoever is doing the special effects for them is insane. Mad respect.
JJ's pov during the challenge 😂😂😂
As soon as they said staying in a hostel and ksi said " noooooo, I'm too rich for this" it made me cringe so bad. My ovaries literally shrivelled. New ick discovered
1:00:00 what is that angle man😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’ve just realised but Harry sniffed that women’s sock 😂😂😂
Vik is so nice.. BROOO STOPP😭 2:11:26
Harry just smelled the sock😂 1:16:17
Comments so npc
3 hours is crazy, no way people watch this whole video
Cool
The swaps are unfair tbvh😂
1:47:31 Saved for later
Vik my beloved
How can you like KSI
😮
2:57:37
this video was so good omd
1:52:15, harry is twitching like crazy
1:43:50, where did simon go?
Chef nick has some serious skills
JJ was so obnoxious this video his was a baby and he was arrogant at the start and the only got worse
1:18:24, no wayy 🤣🤣🤣, Ethan really be funny 🤣😂😂🤣
1:17:39, bro that's hilarious 😂😂😂
1:16:18, bro I can't believe Harry smelled it 😳🤢🤣🤣
1:00:00, bro that camera angle is fu*king crazy bro 🤣🤣🤣🤣
34:30, bro i choose 8 too 🤯😂😂
...I forgot about this channel a long time ago?
"Told them that they didn't finish, and they had a sense of pride. Was it worth it?"
"Any remaining obligations?"
"Satisfied with food?"
"When will the food be cooked?"
"Do you drink toothpaste?"
"Go put a grilled cheese in a frying pan."
"An analytical mind."
"Out of sight, out of mind."
"Go grill some cheese."
"Go pack a suitcase."
"...Can you cook food yet?"
Vik lowkey a pro in skiing.
am i the only one who saw him sniff the sock 😂
I have a conspiracy that tobi always gets good (except the newest one) cause he is Josh's best friend.
31:11 te outfits are actually fire
18:13 My god EDITORRSSSSSS  that was so delightful to watch  Well done.
36:20 sniping
Santi spreading the cheese!!!💰💰💸💸
Imagine being on the bad team and randy turning up to cheer u up..... more like worse team ever!!!
RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW
Adds every 2 minutes is crazy
Why hasn’t Kai make his own headbands yet
Just let Zerkaa host all trips he's AWESOME 🎉
Honestly that vote on jj is so unfair tho fr.
Love this series!
Who's here in 2024
Jj just over reacts manh 🙄😂
23:51
I feel so bad for jj and at the same time its funny that he just dont wanna listen to the ski instructor
Casper was the absolute hero. So funny. Big ups Vik. Actually felt bad for Harry with the tasks on the first night.
ngl i love the instructor guy but phil wouldve been perfect
2:50:32 Callux squeezing JJ
45:05😂😭😭😭
1:58:33 wasted
i am just walking bro                                         - Ksi
the cheap one is just better...
123 🖕😂😂
wait did anyone see harry smell the sock ???
33:31 JJ got grade B in science bro
มาชมชนะวันหยุดด้วยครับ
1:03:55 I love when Harry makes Harry Potter references
Could it have been any more obvious to only use the lit up grips? hahah 57:06
what we call a sweet holiday in a cabin is “the bad team” harry needs to be humbled. i get it they’re millionaires and make a ton of money but for christ sakes your doing this as a living and still getting paid whether on the bad team or not. lots of people including i would kill to have that kind of lifestyle and career bad team or good team. stay humble boys
JJ is so annoying, disrespectful to a fan for no reason
German guy was top teir had my belly hurting 😂
Can JJ/KSI just not be in anymore Sidemen videos going forward as this sour puss attitude he has is not getting old it is old and boring and does not bring me any kind of joy watching him act like this in videos anymore!!!!!
1:47:50 the way vik jumps on the snow 😂😂
WHY DID HARRY SNIFF THE SOCK 1:16:17
Kasper and JJ new duo
Honestly one of the best sidemen video and the best this year for me
Vick is the best person on this planet
That was a movie❤️
35:40
watching them say "ksi downfall" and talking about karma after his song reactions goes insane lmaoooo
5:25 still laughing at this lmao 😭
after seeing vikkstar only in bad team   Audience: Someone get this man a good team
KSI made me laugh everytime
2:16:40 harry speedrunning got me laughing so hard
who ever chose the intro music was spot on
The bad team is actually better than the good
This video has made me realise not everyone is good at climbing 😂😂😂😂😊
DOUBLE UNSKIPPABLE ADS EVERY 5 MINS OMG
Ksiwas born in
Ksiwas born in
Why is ksi always on the good team and vik on the bad one. Change it around for once
German dude was brilliant
ksi too damn noisy
No way Harry sniffed the sock! 1:16:19
Ohhh
I would way rather be in the cheap side and have that much fun then the expensive.jj and Simon and vik were said and bored until the fun came I love the sideman❤
JJ lighter on legs or you'll get thigh burn. Lighter tension , more comfortable,  confidence,  come on..
KSI man , you could try harder bro..😮😊😊
honestly i never thought cheap one is bad it feels like they always end up having more fun
this ending might be the best ending to a sidemen sunday yk
2:47:53 this transition killed me, great vid
Cmon boi got me weak 😅😅
1:17:57 I feel for the lady doin Toby's Massage
Steve flirting!!😂
Come to me vejayjay 😂
Feeling sad for vik he somewhat lands with the bad team
I love how the "bad teams" holiday was nicer then mines
Need more content like this sidemen
The sleepover with the boys at the end was so wholesome
1:16:18 HARRY WHY'D YOU SMELL THE POOR WOMAN'S SOCK?!!!?
"BEER PISS , WE'RE  GETTING CLOSE TO THEM" GGAHAGAGAHAHAHAHHAHAGAGHAHAHAGAGHAGAGAHAHGAAGGGAGAHAGAGAGAHAHHAHAAG
JJ cry’s to much like bro😭
Nah harry smelling that lady’s sock sent me 😂😂😂
I love how Tobi gets so excited when he finally learned to ski🖤
think he maent he loves denmark, eller som  vi siger: VI KA KJØPE HELE SVERIGE OM VI VIL
36:29 What is on their heads
Still makes no sense to me why calling a black person a monkey would be offensive, aren't we all monkeys? I understand that some people legit just have a monkey look but that goes for white people to, one of my old close friends looks like a monkey and he's a white Scottish dude like myself😂
nice video, you can always trust josh to make a banger
I thought ksi was joking but after recent events i beleive he thought of everyone in that buss below him.
the german dude was hella annoying, wtf was the vikky and vajayjay for
Harry hill
I love men
42:00 I like my cheese drippy bruh
JJ acting like he's been rich his whole life bus
Underrated moment: 35:28  Tobi oblivious JJ is trying to move him out of his way and JJ putting his leg up for that wholesome photo.
1:00:00 the eyes ahahahaha
There ski instructor was so funny
Okay but where did the “bad” team get those ski suits?
Im in the think of it evrybody knows it ooooooohhhhohhhhhhhhh 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
we’re in the thick of it everybody knows
43:00 I like my cheese drippy -Jake Paul
JJ needs to be more humble
why did harry sniff the sock?
The way harry smelled the sock of a stranger got me
Justice for Vik honestly. Has gotten so many bad holidays and he is such a big skier and none of the guys chose him to switch. Vik needs a good team holiday
Why doesn’t jj like sledding?
1:06:02 bro predicted it fr
From the screen 📺 to the ring 🥊 to the pen 🖊️ to the king 👑 that’s my crown 👑 that’s my bling 🤑
The intro animation might be better than the video content
2:33:28 hearing ethans skin drag against the metal before actually seeing him was so funny lol
That look more like a blunt then a cigar 😂
Jj spent his night in water spending his stamina like history 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The worst room team had the best nights
It's not fun until JJ is in the bad team
One of the best intros on a Sidemen videos
I wish i can someday make cinematic videos like this 2:04:24  2:14:02  2:19:45  2:58:59 these are great
2:38:46 that man found ksi by tasting his piss
I really love Kasper/Casper hahahahah
2:16:40 aiyooo wtf was that!!
w editing btw. the editing team deserves a raise
Nah the fact that i snowboard and ski made the on the hill events so funny
These guys are just different, I’m so happy I grew up watching them for the past 12ish years🤯
Must be the longest main channel vid
Ksi down fall was his song
Looks so beautiful there I want to live there
npcc????
Actually when you go on a holiday you do things that bad team did ,not the things that good team did😂 great time enjoying the vid
30 million views is crazy! My 3rd watch. Absolutely amazing!
Josh's trickery is the best
Everytime i hear his voice, i hear the thick of it😢
ksi cry baby
I cant stand watching ksi being such a loud annoying person and just ruining others trips, like the dude wanting a picture on the bus and ksi's just laughing in his face calling him an npc
Group hug at the end was everything
Who is this laughing like a pig
W Vikk,I would’ve been pissed with 0 votes
The clip of Harry running back over the bridge sent me
3 hours is diabolical
1 min ago?!?
Why is the pool table blurred out?
1:55:07 what is that gopro model?
Ksi is weird asf
that how my room rn btw the room the cheap team are staying in
1:59 vik goes to spud Tobi 😂
This was hands down one of the best sidemen videos ever and possibly one of the most well-put-together and entertaining videos I've ever seen. The music, the editing, the videography—all of it was insanely well done. Had to come back almost a year later and watch it again lol
I swear JJ is such a bad sport in every video when he doesn’t wanna do something kinda aggravating to watch his parts
why did harry smell the sock XDXD
if vikk ever turns into a villain im 100% supporting it after all these 😭
1:10:23 "Van Van Voooom" 💀
4:32 acting like hes not a normal person
This is a hell of a video. And tbh I wouldn’t consider either team the bad team, ones just better 😂
The way ethan says josh 1:32:41 is so funny
1:14:49 Nahh man I can"t , What even is this dude
What’s the intro song
At 35:46 Toni said and I quote “You can do that tomorrow Hermione” to JJ 😂😂😂😂😂
Who are the people in the hot tub with the good team on the second day
am i the only one that noticed that harry smelled the sock after the girl took it off and gave it to him 🤣🤣
Now i know adventure is more fun than having lavish life.
2:16:39 attack on titan cameo type shi 💀
I love how the instructor ends up laughing at what he is saying, but they cut him off (1:57:00) ish
Can't get a weekend in skegness for 200 guys.....come on be realistic lol great video though just not at all possible
Put vikk on the good team cut the guy some slack 🤣😭
why ksi say im too rich for this like chill bro
nah why ksi calling normal peapole nps
@2:16:40 Harry turned into Cart titan
39:24
At 9.31 it is so funny
Migros? What is a Turkish supermarket doing in Switzerland?
53:06 JJ?
2:16:39 😂😂😂 Harry running like he's from Attack on Titan  And JJ's energy drop from hype to being carried by Cashpur 😂
from the screen to the ring to the pen to the king 🔥
having yt comment on this video is crazy
THE BOYS KNOCKED THIS OUT OF THE PARK. ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THE ENDING.
1:10:16  broo that fufu 😂😂
1:08:11 looks like the good old times..😂😂😂
JJ is such a baby. He literally can’t do anything else than the good team. How does people manage with him?
Nah pulling flight tracker is so real😅
“ NEGATIVE TWENTY?!?!” -tobi (-4 degrees F) Bro it gets to - 51 degrees C here! (-60 degrees F)
1:06:04 toasting to ksi's downfall 6 months before Thick of it's feedback is devious 💀💀
1:00:00 I couldn't see JJ forehead in the way 😢.
2:47:30 is a great song
Great video .... but was it me or did everybody have center partings  Did u get sent back to the year 2000
How are they complaining?
cashpur and the little sleepover part made this video ngl
i think Vikk really likes Borat.
the end of the bad team always seems better icl, its like the bad activities make the vibes better at the end where noone gives a f***
Frankly speaking Josh is the best organizer / planner / orchestrator, he's being the brain it's freaking darn entertaining.
to the ring ahhhhh                                                                                                                    wheres my crown ahh
i have a house in that village that the good team went to absolutely crazy
harry smelling the sock is diabolical 1:16:19
Where is the good team at?
“Jaa”  -Kashpur
Yoo. Is VIK Indian fr?
Bro at 36:40 Simon had a light on his head 😂😂
2:21:51
best 2:19:50
1:21:45 ethan is so random with the football willie competition 😂  jj's awkward silence too
them praying on ksi's downfall and months later, they get it through his new somg is jokes😂
1:10:22 jj is jokes with his french "va va zoom"
25:13 ethan sharing a fat trauma then fat shaming jj is just jokes😂😂😂
14:06 "bye negroes"😂😂😂
I need a full video of Willy size top trumps with JJ and Ethan
Martinez Michelle Thomas Angela Martinez Edward
Anderson Jennifer Lewis Angela Harris Jose
the npc broke the matrics
the 1:00:00 mark is beautiful thank you editors
Brooo they predicted KSI's downfall 💀💀💀
Amazing video, absolutely amazing
I love how KSI is a literal millionaire and could go on these trips once a month and go full out and is so happy and sad when they had done 😂
Harry running on the bridge with a gopro was more like a titan from AOT running
Garcia Carol Martinez Patricia Miller Larry
1:06:02 Prophecy lmao
Beautiful
14:07 Ethan wilding😭
40:27 the reflexes tho
JJ is the funniest member having him on the good team is always funnier. Tobi’s boring
Mmmm k mmm😊p
the instructor was fire
Vik cringe
Nah let’s be honest like almost everyone would do anything to even just be on the bad team cause even that can cost quite a bit
Guy got a little aggressive with Simon
So Ksi really just is a moron lmaooo
Like thick of it 😂talk tuah
1:06:02 I’m worried that this is becoming true
It took 6 months but the curse on JJ worked
Ill be honest i skipped all the good team clips
I cannot stop laughing because of my Guy KSI When he just said freezing 😂🤣🥶☃️🆓❄️🧊
Vik most of the time is always the mvp of the video. He's just a very good friend and unappreciated
Vik is the mvp here... sidemen doesnt deserves vic aint gonna lie
I just love how Vik, Harry, and Simon were so pessimistic 😂
17:53 yo ethan u look a littleee like u got some powder in the nose there ngl
That guy that carried Vik 🔥
There’s no way the $200 holiday cost only $200 . It’s really nice look out the window it’s the friggin snow capped mountains 🏔️!! Also I just want to say how much I appreciate how humble and positive Harry and Vik are .  Being poor like me makes you appreciate almost  anything ! 😂 And really appreciate humble , grateful ppl.
1:19:11 I LOVE HER
Banger video! Btw what song is this at 1:30:20 bro I gotta know
The ending broo.....it was soo good the best 3 hours spend 🥰
Cheap team but you guys are priceless ❤❤❤❤
Cheap team but you guys are priceless ❤❤❤❤
JJ really is the spoiled baby of the group, throwing tantrums when he doesn’t get what hw wants. Vik in the meantime is the wholesome big brother trying to make a family vacation work despite setbacks
2:12:30
40:54  Vik didn't even question Harry locking fingers.
Take the monkey bars out 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 no monkey business 😂😂
Bro how they used so many copyrighted songs?
The ‘bad team’ is an average family vacation
1:26:05 fcking clicker
1:24:50 Hey give a kiss to the camera vik. instantly does it and harry instantly says well that was a bit weird LMAO
at 1:16:20 when harry smells the womans sock had my dieing
We could only pray😂
The ending with the music and the credits great idea! Should be on every VS video, felt like a movie, just added that little bit of something 🤌
oh wow. ksi's forehead is bigger than i thought
26:06 old jj there
To be honest 90% are middle class watching this and they support poor team enjoyment .😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤
Everything the cheap team was doing the first day is looking so much more fun
What a bunch of whiny babies
Why did he smell it. 1:16:18
2:07:24 does ksi have a hidden septum piercing?? Or am I seeing stuff
i didn't think i would hear ksi screaming today 1:17:36
2:16:40  😂😂😂😂
Honestly the “bad team” is literally your average American vacation trip man. Their being such prunes when they got a beautiful view, little cabin, great activities that’s what us normal people celebrate guys!!! Humble yourselves!!!
(1:05:37)  Confirmed: Josh is a terrible influence on recovering alcoholics lol  Viks positive vibes, carried the bad team. Vik deserved more.
The SKI INSTRUCTOR.. slaaaayyyuuyyy😂❤ the edit, the camera.. you didnt have to make.him look so.good😂😂😂😂
These ski outfits are ridiculous 😂
1:16:16 harry sniffing the sock is absolutely nutty🤣
1:14:49 JJ looks like the travis scott fish meme
W editor
After this video, if i ever saw jj irl im not going to him, asking for a selfie 😭
Whats the name of the music in the backround on start
Why tf was Harry smelling the sock 😂😂😂😂
Not jj looking like frozone from incredibles in the ski suit
Can my Sister have Her sock back please
PUT VIKK ON THE GOOD TEAM FOR ONCE
ethan eyes are mesmerize to be honest
Only the rooms even the bunk bed ones in Verbier would cost the 200.... No food and no travel fees included 😂
Why is the one guy in the blue skiing overall screaming with every word he is "saying"?
1:23:00
Actually loved this video! Felt like a movie!
I think Vik should get a power to swap teams for at least 3 videos, no questions asked. Honestly this man's positive attitude is GOATED!
3hr sidemen Video get it man
53:00 vik has crazy thoughts man😂😂😂
ETHAN STOP FORCING THE LAUGH 😂
Tobi sleep alot and tobi and jj dont like snow so it feels like a waste to put them on a good team but no matter what team any of them are on , we won't be happy
2:16:50 looks like a scene straight out of AOT 😂
Heaven sponsored by Prada
Caspa needs to make more surprise visits just to watch jj react lol
Sometime I think they put JJ in situation to humble him 😂
Best video of all time hands down!
Editing is mad
1:16:18 why the hell did Harry smell the sock
😊😅😊😊😅😊😊😅😊😊😅😊😅😊😊😊😊😅😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😅😊😊😊😊😊😅😊😅😊😅😊😊😊😊😊😊
Still coping after this suits, this is why i love Harry
i for one didnt like the team change tbh, doesnt seem fair even if he did gloat
3 hour video is mad, and a 3 hour video with 26 million views rn is even more crazy
2:12:36 was the best part
This is the first holiday video I watched where Ethan was actually put on the good team   But I think Vik lost it
Loved it, amazing episode 😊😊😊
watching this for the 3rd time now lol... @ 1:04:45  i really want to know what, or if the body guard had to do any thing there.
ngl the Vik fanboys ruined this for me
Keep putting harry in the bad team he deserves it he always complains.  him and vic
Harry’s well good for his first time I couldn’t even stand second day in 😂😂
CASPHER IS SOO FRICKING LITT
Alcoholism is a REAL problem, FU for forcing someone to drink.
2 points .... 1. When is Vik on the Good team, ngl feels sus. 2. JJ in Never on bad team ... Even if he is they do a turn around later in the vid
2:16:40
I feel like Ksi and Toby get the good team a lot of the times
To be honest I really feel bad for VIK he’s the only one who hasn’t been in a good team not fair 😢 but still love the sideman
This is why Christianity is at the verge of its downfall. Making fun of jesus you guys should be protecting Christianity and not making fun of the religion.
2:16:40 what is happening
2:15:58 the way he turned was jokes
I feel bad for vik man he is so humble and sweet man please let him in good team guys
Harry should be always on the cheap team from now on
insane plane animation mannnnnnn
Anderson Nancy Walker Thomas Brown Melissa
WE NEED MORE!!!!!
27:48 Tobi oversteering the sled got me dying for no reason
Lewis Sandra Martinez Amy Lee Jason
@vikkstar123 1:22:12 VikkJager
52:00 JJ and Tobi are like “no monkey business” 😂 like the time tobi got caught on twitter, climbing a tree.
At 36:30 are thay beeing sniped
The times when cashbar cracked with little giggles got me dying😅
1:18:25 is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
KSI is such a pu**y, can't respect that L
1:25:20  Someone help me with this music
.
1:14:35 why would Ethan come up with this idea 😭
vik is giving ned flanders
I guess not all black men are athletes
Vik when he found out he had no votes ☹️☹️☹️☹️
14:03 this got me dead
The good team representing the 🇵🇭
Vik should always be on bad team.... Or else.. The bad team will do nothing and it'll be boring.... Good team is always boring as hell....
Harry and simon knew as soon as they were with vic lol
I wonder what would have happened if all bad team members got a vote each, would JJ be by himself with the camera crew?😂
1:18:25 😂✊
My favorite 3 in one team
All those for Ethan hosting a holiday this like this comment
Ethan should host one of these
Nah man vikk needed that Olympian
Simon looks good here he should get this haircut again.
Bro be it the good team or the bad team the cinematics with the cinematics Song Are JUST SO CRAZY BRO!!!🤩🤩
2:16:44 look at Harry
Vik-10000000000 Aura
24:00 amogus in 2024
Gotta be honest, JJ being on the good team is getting really boring. Like, he’s on the good team 80%. I suggest you don’t let any of the boys even decide this because at this point it’s obvious JJ bribes the one who decides. On top of that, as a viewer, seeing JJ be a nonce is not nearly as entertaining as seeing him mad.
1:26:43 great shot. Static shot is nice ngl
They have a good point. Doesn’t matter how much you pay for a holiday, as long as you’re there with ones you love
Looks like Sonic, Tails and Knuckles are having a good time sledding
1:35:17 If someone gets all 3 votes, the teams should stay the same/they should stay where they are. Makes it interesting and you can't target
57:49 why the table blurred
1:16:18 Harry just casually smelling that woman’s sock 😂😭😭
JJ is always in the good team
2:16:40 i just spat my cuppa out everywhere
1:16:19 Harry sniffing the sock is mental😂
You heard it here First Ladies and gentlemen, Frenkie De Jong has a rocket on him 😂
1:16:18 Harry just smelled a random woman’s sock. 🫡
Harry’s ski gear looks fire ngl
Can someone tell me where this ski resort is ? 😭 I’m from the US by the way
ksi is quite boring ain’t he
Nigerian bredahzzz
Sidemen we need your help in Nigeria 🤧🤧😭❤️😂 they youths need your financial help
Great video it’s called 500 vs 500,000 mobile house
The editing on these videos is top tier 🫡
Cashpur NEEDS to become a regular on the Sidemen channel 😭 MAKE MUTTER VERY PROUD
Ksi is looking fat
Im gonna be like this 🙌. Even though it’s just a video. These videos inspire me ngl.
Can I say the music in this video made it feel like a movie. Wow, just wow!
1:03:45 WHEN YOU REALIZE TOBI IS THE MOST ATHLETIC
This video is going to reach 100 million views
all i got to say is im 30 minutes in and the "bad" team looks like it would actually be fun and they make a big fuss over bunkbeds and outfits but its not even bad its still a bed and the outfits are atleast decent just more 80's era. honestly sometimes yall can act so rich like oh no a bunkbed oh no i have to wear a nice outfit someone bought for me and not to mention make money doing all this because its for content... i get some pessimism but sometimes its just annoying like stop moaning and groaning and grow up ffs. im just keeping it real
2:23:52 I genuinely feel bad for vik
We love you vik😂
Funniest video I have ever seen
Sucking what 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I think they should let Vik plan one of these trips. He can have his revenge then😂
Either they r just doing it for content by putting vik on the bad team everytime it’s all planned by the boys together or something or they just doing it on purpose. It looks like they just bullying him n he doesn’t seem to notice it bcuz they’re his friends. But tbh it does seem like they do it on purpose. If vik is on the bad team next time that’s it for me👎🏻
KSI is White underwater
1:25:19 name of the background music please ?
whoever did fat ksi, i love you
I wish y’all would just do a vacation together instead of making one team supper 😢
No one gonna talk abt the intro?
Ich Ich Ich Ich Ich lebe mit Leben um mein Herz aufzugeben oder so und meine Gefühle in den Händen halten und die Hoffnung nicht zu erfüllen lassen sich auch noch mehr Zeit und und das ich es auch tue was sie nicht
1:25:52 HAHAHAAHAH
1:11:45 Simon proves he's a real life villain for the billionth time 😭😭😭😭
Who else watch the whole vid ?
Awesome
What’s the ski resort called that JJ, Vik and Simon went to?
40:11 also JJ: "is there caviar here"
never watched a 3hr video without any skip before lol
Id rather be the bad team
please make Cashpur a sideman too funny
Why does jj have to scream and shout all the time?
Zerkaa cooked with this one
What an outro
any npc here or am i the only one
I feel bad for Vic and Harry😂
How tall is Simon? 192?
At 38:23 please tell me I am not the only one that thought Oreo
You need to do a cheap vs cheap but the boys think it’s a regular cheap vs expensive 😂
2:04:23
Update ,nah vik deserved better!!!!
10 outa 10 video
I didn’t really like jjs attitude on the bus tbh. I hope he’s just tryna be funny cause that’s no way to be at all. That’s your fan dude.. one of the people that made you.
1:49:38 that's it Vicky
S/o Nick the Chef hahaha looks like a proper guy 42:30 big up brother
2:58:10 This rivals "To be fair though..."
ksi try not to be insufferable challenge *impossible*
Jj be nicer to ur fans bro there the reason ur famous
Can we have another holiday video please
i get second hand cringe watching Vik in sidemen videos. repeating himself to be heard. talked over constantly.. always with the *imagine* this and *imagine* that.. no one cares for his opinion and his company.. hurts to see every video lmao XD like a glorified extra
H
The skii instructor was a bit sus there 😅😅😅
Anyone else think Bazinga looks like Benjamin Helstad - Harry, from the Netflix Series: Raganrok? He was based around the God Tyr: God Of War. In the show, the actor Harry snowboarding and did Olympic skiing, just like Behzinga - Ethan Payne does. This is amazing. He had brown hair originally, and now is blonde, just like in the show, He did the same thing!!!
The intro sounds like Dan t dm
🚫🚫🚫🚫spoiler blocker🚫🚫🚫🚫🚫
8:44  مو حقيقيين 😂
at 1:12:00 ksi looks like a fortnite default 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ksi is like a real life me🤣
jj should never be on the expensive team again
JJ are really good at climbing 💀🐒
The bad team is always like my luxurious holidays 😂
😢🎉
Josh has got to be the most underrated YouTuber
At 2:00:50 i thought i got shot at
Yo the German guy needs to be with JJ any time he’s on the bad team hahahaha
That intro was crisp
This was a masterpiece Josh
kinda hard to watch JJ when he acts like he’s better than everyone else constantly
Harry smelling the sock at the edge of the screen 1:16:20 🤣
Ha gutted Vik
the chef is happy
Lol when ever jj gets put in the crap team he becomes so depressed 😅
Is Vikstar sticky Vicky. Cashpur kept calling him Vicky.
2:18:15 Does Vik know that UK is a part of Europe? :P
2:16:46 war on earth am I witnessing
Jj wanted to laugh at the other teams suffering 😂😂😂😂... Love from South Africa 🫶
I'm not gon lie, I'm more invested on the bad team more than the good team...
2:16:40 I- ....
Tobi needs to be in the trenches
🔥 intro
ion even like the sidemen but they really made this 3 hours long for as much money as possible 💀
That 200 winter holiday looked hella fun
stellar video. this is what is about yall, kicking back, enjoying life, spending it with your mates! been watching these guys since i was 10/11 years old. Im 22! Brings a tear to my eyes seeing all of them happy. love yall fr, thanks for keeping me entertained all these years. this is what i aspire to do with my friends when we make it 🤝❤️
In my opinion a good team with KSI never seems like real fun but I love the content
harry running across the 3000 meter bridge is hilarious
Free Vik
2:16:38 xD the cut
I love the sidemen!
https://youtube.com/shorts/ounLeyLuV5o?si=tgIElBWPclio2kCE
12:42  😂😂😂  keep clicking

Only Allah is god only Allah is worthy of worship ❤
You Know Rock Paper And Scissors Has A Secret Weapon That Can Destroy Rock, Burn Paper And Tear Apart Scissors Right..Dynamite= Fist With Thumb Up When It Goes Off All You Gotta Do Is Open The Hand..Destroys All Rock Paper And Scissors..But Here Is The Thing, Can Only Be Used Once..In A Best of Three/Five..Yes There Are Rules To The Dynamite..So It Can't Constantly Be Used...So Pick Your Choice..If Both Use Dynamite It Becomes A Dud..And Nobody Wins And Nobody Gets To Use Dynamite Again..
46:00 Another list 2:58:02
I always go to morzine my mums mate has a house/mansion   and its sick
I felt so bad for jj saying he is an npc
Honestly class, really enjoyed watching the whole thing.
The blm logo being used as the symbol for the rock paper scissors minigame 💀
It’s actually hard to watch him u can tell he’s uncomfortable and doesn’t really like them lol
38:08 Ethan has way too much money not to know what a charcuterie board is lol
the camera man is too bad!!!!!!
tobi patting out ethans fart is a new level of brotherhood
I love pizza
Casper is a real one. Love the vibes he brings 😂😂
whoever is making the animations for these videos need more money
Neither option is affordable to working class people...lol you all say ksi is rich, do any of you know what minimum wage is? 😂
Anyone else notice the creator’s unique style?
theres no way ksi actually said hes scared of water
Would you rather be on the, Good Team Forever or Bad Team Forever?
1:18:26 always remember the moment Ethan jerked Tobi while he was getting a facial 😂😂😂😂
All I heard off harry was I can’t be arsed
The beacons are lit! I know where and when you are! 2:22:42
2:16:41 put me in a blender
ethan the only man using a snowboard
Kashper was hilarious!! (totally spelt his name wrong)
The scenes on that bridge with this beautiful song behind is just..it made me look that scene multiple times and stay in awe,on top of that realise how truly you enjoy your lives. 👏👏
can we make babies 🥵
Master piece
epic ending
36:06 ❤ 40:54 ❤❤❤ 1:36:44 the huuug🥹
36:06 ❤❤❤
30:41 harry saying sorry about his snores😢❤
best movie 2024
1:16:19 bro smeled it XDDDDDDDDD
Why was he so rude when that guy wanted a photo
bghjjhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Why does the bad team always feel like they're actually the winner team
Love the vid keep it up boys
1:29:16
Ksi suffering was amazingly funny
that was crazy, big up the sidemen for bringing bangers non-stop
The vid is 3 hours long. I could watch 2 films in that time
Why is ksi always in the good team.. I'd enjoy watching him be on the bad team more often.
vikk is a typical indian put spice in everything
1:16:48 vik got violated by a random stranger lmao
Getting tired of the Milinionar and his same race friend always getting special treetment and always on the good team. Not random teams anymore if 2 members are always the same. Like. At this point just re upload your last video about 2 teams one good one bad. Pretty sure will always be the same with the man who cries cause he thinks he deserves better. DUDE we ALL deserve better so SUCK IT THE F UP.
1:16:20 aaaa yo harry sniffed the sock my boi be wild 😂
what JJ thinks is fun and what they call fun are two different things lol🤣🤣🤣
He’s deffo smoking a spliff init
why nobody talking about the snoring who was that lol
why was jj laughgin at someone asking for a selfie
2:24:41
xqc
JJ is such a spoiled little girl in all these good team/bad team videos.  Man this is such a punishment tobogganing with my friends 😅
That guy had s23 ultra. Wtf does KSI mean look at the NPC phone. The K in KSI always shines strong 😂😂😂
Brother went for a whiff of the sock- Harry had like 2 drinks and that's all it took for the intrusive thoughts win-💀
JJ just can not have fun, he's miserable all the time lol. Enjoyed Vik a lot more, he knows how to make the most out of the experience.
What an intro song
Like all the guys but jj have no respect for other people 🤦‍♂️
YOOOOOO HARRY SMELLED THE SOCKKKKK!!!!
Omg I love the sidemen Wooooooo 😂😂😂😂
Why did Harry smell the sock 😭 1:16:19
2:12:46 ❣️
I know Harry didnt just smell the sock at 1:16:20 no fuckin way
Should do a cheap vs expensive yatch holiday
I have never seen a 3 hour YouTube video. Didn't skip a sec. 🎉 one of the best.
2:13:00 Dream of para para paradise! *switches to jj falling over* LOL
I love Harry’s optimism in every video that he’ll be on the good team
9:30 not them dissing a phone more expensive then theirs 😂
27:50: tobi face full of snow 🤣🤣
at 2:12:00 JJ is funny as hell
Casper is so funny bro
this was such a good video
the guy who punched simon instead of playing rock paper scissors 😭😭
❤❤W ❤❤❤❤
Simon, youre lucky, were going to bed in like 5 minutes. Vikk, NAH NAH ITS A PARTY.
2:26:27 JJ Just giving the bed to Vikk after having such an awful day, Simon too, I hope these guys have some fun in store for them tonight. Also can we please just get a video where everyone has a miserable day together, then has a great time together? I think thatd be really fun =)
Starting a petition for VikK!  Vikk is so nice filming and skiing so Jack can concentrate on being safe. PLEASE give this man a gold ticket to a good team. Meaning no tricks, no swaps for him, he doesnt gotta be paranoid, he just gets to enjoy <3
1:59:36 shout out to this man who REPEATEDLY lifted JJ when he was in dead weight mode, and who trolled him XD Your prayers have been answered guys, enjoy the show. I think thats the only reason Vikk isnt complaining about not going on harder stuff, he was even filming! He was totally here for JJ suffering and I am here for all of it.
Josh listened to the people <3
Zerka in the chicken outfit is so freaking wholesome <3
Naaaa harry sniffing the sock 😂😂😂😂😂
Proof that money buy happiness
i LOVE that he said hes too rich for a hostile lmaoooooo
Jj is such an entitled brat. Vik hasnt had a good team and is still positive. While jj is being rude, moody , disrespectful, and crying like a girl. You're a 30 yr old multi millionaire. Get over yourself 😂😂
God JJ is so annoying
Nah JJ was so rude on that bus
Ethan is so annoying
The part where Vik and Harry said no to the jump transition made me laugh so hard😂😂
JJ so funny bro calling them npcs 😂😂😂😂😂
Brooo the edit at start whit music and plane smooooooth 😮
Best sidemen sunday of all time?
2:29:19
2:22:22
1:29:16
27:52 btw my fav song ❤
Tobi is so lucky
Harry's the biggest baby
The more i watch ksi the more i dnt like him just a boring hating spiteful person. Even when tried to add monkey bars in the obstacle he completely refuses just cause he cant do shi
I love it when all the guys get together
Mystery of the sidemen who was snoring 😂
I sat here clapping for you toby ❤
Jj is such a public nusince😊
KSI try not to be insufferable challenge (impossible)
Casper after every sentence “yahhh”
What the sigma
2000000000000004 like
We need another one of these vids lads 🥰🥰🙏
No one else gonna mention Harry sniffing that sock?
1:26:58
24:04
I need myself someone who looks at me like Ethan looks at that cheese covered potato at 42:05
Fun to see the good team sleeing down morzine were i skied last year
KSI wearing a KSI shirt is a KSI thing to do.
1:29:16 I wonder how little JJ reacted to this back in the day???🤔
12:00
cashpur was just a great addon to the video. Er ist ein echter Berliner ;)
Vikk and Miniminter are two of the fakest youtubers of all time. Both give off serial killer vibes0
The good team food was dead tbh
do you know any french then? vava vouuum..*moans*
2:22:34 lol
Big up Karl pilkington the goat 🐐
Seeing JJ, Tobi, and Ethan struggle so bad with the obstacle course knowing I could easily get under a minute was so funny😂
1:05:00 “you’ve won a facial” is crazy
45:30 yeah, until you lose
The nigerian brothers togheter
the credits were so cute
tip for new skier's. never point your toes together in a point. it is hard to explain in writing teaching new ones to ski but never do the triangle. It is the worst way to teach someone and they will never stop doing it. It is probably the worst way to stop in skiing. Do research, get more opinions from other skier's and coaches but if your coach tells you to point your toes inward toward each other, get a different coach. I can teach someone within one hour to comfortably go down an intermediate - advanced slope from their 0 experience and they will not fall over once. I have done it many times. And I will refuse to mention "the A frame", "pointed toes" or "triangle" or whatever you call it. Its horrible and soooooo outdated
Anyone else staring at Jj's booger at 2:07:00? Nope? Just me ok
2:07:16 its like the old KSI lmao!
JJ makes the best villain tho hands down. the evil laugh of victory is wild lol
Ksi - Drama Queen toddler Vik - Positvity Harry - hilarious tantrums but still does it 😂
Since when does Dan tdm narrate the sidemen 😂
47:29 what was vik about to say☠️
1:16:20 Im sorry am the only one baffled on why Harry smelled the sock 😭
JJ is unbearable in these videos. He gloats endlessly when he's part of the good team and whines endlessly when he's in the cheap team
Personal timestamp- 02:05:00
Leave it to ksi to throw a fit after having the good team then doing something fun and also throw a fit when getting on a bus with NORMAL people who don’t make a billion pounds a year
Wish they would do 10k vs 10k holidy but each team doesn't know if they're on the good team or the bad team 😂
The thing if I was in these wether I got a good or bad team both of them are good to me 😂😂😂😂😂 literally what the bad team went through would be so fun with my friends ! Like I would be the happiest to experience what they did
1:16:10 Harry smelling the sock🤣
1: 1:16:20 bro literally sniff it😂
Sideplus saturday ad was sucha clean transition went so hard for no reason
1:14:54 omg JJ is white
2:22:28 Omg Vikkkkk!!!!!! You’re a nice guy but shut theF up with all the nagging. You just go on and on and on
funny how jj and tobi didnt want to do monkey bars
North America it’s green, blue, black, double black. Red must be blue
I was not a fan of vik but the more he suffer i really like him more and more he keep a very positive personality...
1:25:23 what song is this
Cigar on the zip hell yeah
Vik is awesome as always.
JJ Screaming at the beginning of the video made my night "I'm too rich for this!" xD love you too JJ
i felt so bad when vik didn't get a single vote he's always left out even tho he's the most positive and humble
I love vik so much no one understands
harry just casually sniff the sock 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Is it only me or the "$200" holiday looked so much more fun than the expensive one
56:44🇩🇰🇩🇰
So ksi is just a c*nt to all people
Rewatching this I peeped something WILD.  Harry decided to sniff the sock🤣🤣 1:16:19
8:40
You know the sidemen budget has gone up when they can afford to do all this AND license a bunch of copyrighted tracks for the video
love the videos but always hearing jj complain and scream is a bit rude to everyone else just there living their lives
Last 10 minutes were amazing, such joy.
Harry deserved to be in a bad team
Kashper
We need more of Cashper and JJ. PLEASE BRING HIM AGAIN TO THE CHANNEL.
The second half was so fcking evil
He did not sniff the sock 15 feet from the girl😂😂😂 god Harry 😂
shut up ksi your too loud
Well Well Well.. 1:03:23
14:03 Byy migros🤣🤣🤣🤣
This was a great journey
i heard you didn’t tip in the chalet
You guys should get cashpur back in more sidemen videos
1:00:00 😰
Ksi ruins the sidemen
I wonder what Vikk said to the bodyguard @ 1:11:49..
Vik not getting any votes felt so mean, I atleast thought Tobi would vote vik 😭
Jayjay saying: there are normal people in here 😂😂😂
2:12:45
super underrated line was when Tobi and Vik got swapped, tobi says "I knew it, I knew he'd put the Nigerians together"
tbh cheap team had more vibes
Nah slick the bad team got better outfits
https://youtube.com/shorts/5zVtWoZSPpQ?si=gtFIzuoYgM-1hgie chillz
Can yall do a full holiday video just in finland
500000 is an easy target as long as KSI suffers 😂
Bro JJ couldn't have been more rude lmao. L JJ.
Watching JJ interact with normal everyday people is like watching Jeff bezos walking into a salvation army
What are you dooing guys?
This guy was so worried about his cheese he disguised it as a rock.. bro I'm dead 😂😅
2:58:05 LMAO
37:51 Steve rizzing up a lady haha
wtf with the ads yt
42:39 probably made his day
Introvert vs Extrovert holiday
2:16:40 I like how he went from this is scary to this ...
Our fat neek is bk 😂😂😂
please let Vikstar in a good team pls pls pls
Kasper's such a vibe man
FATNEEK IS BACK
Fantastic video If it were me i’d choose the bad team’s holiday ngl.  And tobi is an npc
jj might be the whitest black person ever
VA-JJ LMFAO
1:04:50 this npc tried to attack Simon but the bodyguard stopped him 😂
Why jj is always on the good time
jj calling the dude on the bus an "npc" for having a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is crazy 😂
do this again but make both teams the poor team
the cheap team is my jam. I went to the snow once and I hated it! spent most the day drinking hot chocolate . so a small cabin  and the pizza is such a nice thing
cheap team won. they made do with what they had even if disappointed it will be the day when JJ gets the worst holiday. I think we all laugh when he falls or does something stupid is because he's the one that is obsessive with the first class lifestyle
Popping off bangers
this was a movie
Josh, this is such great production. Good job man.
Appreciate James the cameraman guy for his skiing skills 😂
honestly ksi is very funny but i think the good team is sometimes wasted on him because he always hates the actual entertaining things
1:15:56
I think the host should rotate
I think the bad team ends up having more fun then the good team half the time
why did harry smell the sock
i feel so sorry for all the people on the bus with jj god i get its for the content but i'd be SO annoyed
1:49:03 can't believe nobody mentioned the sunglasses under the goggles
Did you pay for people to ride a that bus because they way to chill with yall screaming
1:38:30 bro😂😂
bad team is actually having fun XD
Not June yet but crazy🎉
Crazyyy🎉🎉
Idk why y’all even love that curry ahh Indian bloke
Okay JJs instructor was actually a legend lol
hi
The camera men being on skis during the sledding is lowkey skilled af
never noticed how many people they have on the sdmn team
2:58:07 calfreezy heart rate 😂😂
I was here at the hotel 1 month before The W
i love ethan, jj and tobi on a team
i swear jj always gets the good team
Ksi being arrogant as ever
Video was banger
American here, am I the only one that hardly understands English speakers, it sounds like mumbling 90% of the time
1:10:33 IF SOMEONE STEALS MY CHEESE I'LL NEVER FORGIVE EM 😂 I'm DEAD BRO
Why is no one talking about harry smelling the sock 😂😂😂
❤
BRO THAT CAM 59:59 WHAT AN ANGLE
VJJ😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 bring this guy back again pleaseeeee
THIS WAS BASICALLY A MOVIE!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2:12:46 everything about that shot was PERFECT
33:45 jj and ethan looking JACKED
Mr. Casphur was jokes😅😂
Ngl the ending was kinda wholesome with all of the bad team all togethor on the mountain like the ending scene in a movie. Josh the mad genius has done it again! 🤩
2:16:39 you're welcome
i feel like jj would do really well with a food channel
Blue, C
good
whos here after the email
for the Side+ people, the answer is Red
I truly envy the Sidemen and their close bond with each other… wish I had a close friend group like that 😢
Vik deserves to be in an expensive team lol
This video was great. A 3 hour sidemen Sunday is bonkers. Took me like 4 days to watch 😂
That opening was next level, the music was an insane touch 🙏
Might be one of the only ones that would rather just watch the “bad team” because they are having a more genuine experience
everytime i see a sidemen video longer than 1 hour it makes my whole week
It was so nice of JJ to get the chef to come out and congratulate him for his cooking
Will JJ ever stop complaining?
This video need me 3 times watch to get me ended this whole video tho
I felt so bad for that guy who asked for a picture but got laughed at
Petition to get vik a good team
Now this is a quality among us video more like thissss
Why toby always with jj
They should do one where they are both the bad team and they’re just upset with the others the entire time
Took me 2 hours of watching to figure out it’s a 3 hour video 😭
That "I'M TO RICH FOR THIS" always gets me man 😂😂😂😂 5:27
Vik came in with - “I’m bullish” - we see u vik 👀👀
Whenever I watch these video’s the one thing I know is KSI is not getting the rubbish side…. So it does take a little out of the suspense.
Is it just me or is Ksi like really unfunny and just cringy and childish. Like I feel like the rest of the sidemen just pretend to find him funny, bigging him up because he’s a cash cow for them.
Wat een onzinnige bagger video weer. Sommige oudjes kunnen gewoon niks meer gelaas
JJ is the opposite of adrenaline junkie
vikk deserves to be on the good team more
3 hours!?!
5:43 if this was american someone would have shouted hey N***a quit being a Bi*ch
w song picks
Will harry give into peer pressure? Find out soon 😂😂😂😂bloody ell KSi is so fat now again 😂😂😂thats his downfall guys on losing team 😂he actually went to the losing team 😂it is so friggin great seeing KSi suffer haaahahahahahahahahahaaaaa…this was a good movie
Josh being the chicken the whole time was actually so cute lol I love him
Ksi fell so bad in my eyes after that video
vik is best
01:04:49 . First time a man beat rock with rock in RPS. 😂😂😂
JJ getting the expensive one again, I cant believe it. At this point getting JJ in your team is practically a instant win. Either way, I think the reason is that if JJ got the cheap one it will be quite depressing but either way the cheap team is always the funny one that is why I have no complain in that department
Great video boys, Love the camera work and editing (great choice of songs)🎉🎉🎉
Wrlp its at 554K guess ur not goin on ever again 😂
They should do video with @sam & Colby
JJ really making these videos harder to watch everytime
Tobi should just leave sidemen, no one likes him
The way the bad team is still better than places I go to lmao
Cashpur the instructor saying ver-JJ😂
vik is underated
Oh my god Fat KSI at 1:01:40 was hilarious 😂
In these videos the bad teams vacations are always better then mjne still
Josh is surely on the bad team next time
tobi helping jj w/ his coat was the cutest thing ever😭
1:58:48 Ethan's doing well you lot! I wish i knew how to snowboard
" look at the phone his got " wow fr...
Actual banging vid
The wallmart Bruno was funny 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The fact that ksi Thought That he was getting the 200,000k trip but it was actually the 200 One 😢
2:11:17 of course I know the Finnish sauna, because I live in Finland.
Harry is always on the bad team because he's just so entertaining to watch honestly
Jj is so out of touch with reality 😂😂
Next time send VIK to the Good team
Never put ksi on a holiday again hes so cringey and unfunny
5:25 JJ looks so excited. 😭
Ksi is so obnoxious on that bus, smh
2:16:41 😂😂😂
i wish i wasn't poor and could go on at least one trip even the bad team is good in this one
31:57
loved tge ending
Ofc vik said the plain might crash into a mountain
Jj the walk bro😂😂😂😂😂Im dead😂😂😂😂😂
i lowkey find ksi annoying like he seems so spoiled in video with the whole like richer then everyone and wants them to know it vibe
Harry Sniffing the sock is outta Pocket! 💀 💀 💀
They got rights to fatboy slim?🔥🔥
KSI is actually an embarrassment 😂 you're not above anyone in any way brother. I hope you get humbled.
Ksi  needs to touch grass omfg bro is such a spoiled rich "guy" lmfao
what is the BGM starting from 0:15sec
Ngl JJ was so rude and disrespectful on the bus and to his fan. He was screaming how cheap and bad it was when other people probably spent 3 pay checks on it
w e      s  h o u l d   c a n c e l ksi
jj actually pissing me off
Can anyone name the song used in the plane intro?
I like Ksi but he kinda ruins these videos for me when all he does is constantly complain about every single thing that happens and he never even tried to make things fun
We need more ski and holiday videos
wow
Vic mvp
instructor took his goggles to have smaller goggles underneath 😭 1:49:20
Me causally changing the like from 551k to 552 on command
2:54:14 the absolute violation of callux here is so funny
I would do almost anything to go to Glacier 3000 Man u have no idea how much I want it
Hhehehe
KSI LAUGH ISSO FUNNY LIKE POV KSI LAUGH:AU AU AU GA GA GA AAAAAAAAAA OAOAOAOAOAOAOOUAUAUAUAAYAYAYAYHA HA.     HA.      HA HUUUuuuuuuuu…… done
dfh
that intro was insane!!!
Bro drank jjs downstream piddle 😂
HARRY THOOOO😋😍
24:43 Is it me or is the music giving stardew valley vibes?
Harrys reaction to someone snoring is priceless
Yoo that had to be the sickest video ever
End credits were so wholesome 🥺
tbh bad team looks like an epic holiday for the average man
Cașper is ELITEEEE 🤣🤣🤣 never fails to make this awkwardly funny
1:17:35 Siren alert 🚨
Honestly my favorite sidemen is JJ but he made this video worse when he got on the bad team😕
14:03
Justice for vik 😂
that ski instructor is phenomenal he called master Vikstar and JJ Vicky and veJJ
ksi skipping the monkey bars was so funny 😂 1:01:00
I just love seeing JJ suffer in the bad team, it's the funniest thing in the world :)
I feel really bad for vik, they never vote for him to get the good team even tho he’s the best sideman
I was about stopping the video when I didn't see #ksi @sidemen
Video might not bang on views but this was amazing, reminded me of the time in Benedorm hope i spelt that correct lol. Josh your the goat 🐐❤️  This felt like a movie man with the ending and all, big up the editors man 🙌👏
Ski Patrol watching JJ: 👁️👄👁️ 2:01:32
Where is Ksi’s sixpack ?
take a shot whenever Ski instructor says YEAH!!
KSI acting like he doesn't have most of those in his own house or houses I should say 💀
02:16:40 is amazing😭🤣
2:04:23 fifa nostalgia
31:27 / 3:00:57
Simone Vs Drunk Lad 1:04:51
Imagine living the cheap team life and don’t stop complaining. These guys are so spoiled.
The Editing is FIREEE🔥🔥
1:10:21 bro what 🤣🤣
Next time do a josh only vs the other sidemen holiday challenge
Casper is a vibe
When Vik started getting angry and upset about the situation, it truly made me sad. His positive energy is rivaled to none and is the reason why he deserves so much respect and love from the community. Keep up the good vibes Vik!
absolutely love casper please make him appear some more
1:40:02
Why has ksi put on loads of weight
Justice for vikk he deserves a good team
There should be more of these loooonng vidoes like the chris md road trip that was great and this was great too it felt more like i was watching a movie than anything else
Vik is sooo underrated man
Are they in avoiraz ?
Cool 😎
That Coldplay - Paradise scene is so beautiful
Simon hugging Cashpur like a lost friend he ran into after 10 years, was very wholesome
why is ksi eating mcdonald’s when it’s boycott? BOYCOTT MCDONALDS
Vikk was the Goat here... For the +vity man... Respect❤❤❤
cheap v expensive v Josh would be hilarious 🤣
2:16:40 NAHHH LMFAO
29:48 made me feel something i never knew i could feel
2:16:41 just the view I needed 😂😂
I like how JJ Pissed in the dark and later on, Calfreezy drank the river water and said it tasted like piss 🤣
yall i swear i put this video off for three weeks but i swear it might be in my top 5 videos its actually so good
Awwww why would they do Vik like that, he's AWESOME! Literally my favourite Sidemen, they should appreciate him more, he's a great person all around🥺🥺❤❤
1:14:39 I actually love Ethan 😭😭🤣
It gives the vibes
I love Sidemen
3hrs & it really dragged at the end. I got bored, Kashper was fun but this got lame & way over the time it should've been. 1hr is a short but nice sidemen Sunday usually, 2hrs is a surprise, 3hrs is too long I think.
I actually really like the bad teams outfits, I’d wear those
What is MPC?
Vik, Harry and Simon is my favourite trio
I didn't realize how ginger Ethan's beard was until his bleached hair
thanks🤩
1:38:09
2:16:40 DYING 🤣🤣🤣
Loved the part where jj wanted to call the boys and gloat on them and tobi said "you can do that tomorrow" and he was like ok in a cute baby way😊
1:44:38 Harry smelled the sock
why did he smell the sock😂
40:26 awwww hell nahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Why do i want JJ on the "poor" side so badly? oh yea he was the first to laugh in the bus..
2:16:39 for someone
Harry how’s your sister x
Ed Shearen  opened the door
I like how 90% of the time the "bad team" is like a holiday for me with which I'd be so happy😂
1:16:19 did he just smell it?🤢
Ethan you have to lean forward way more
JJ deserved the ski instructor 😂
39:24 vik slaying it with his rymes
Couldn't even get passed the part of JJ complaining. Like dude, you're skiing in Switzerland. Shut up
Felt so bad for Vik in the vote. Not 1, man's worse off for bad team than Ethan by quite a bit now.
is it me or the "bad " or " cheap " team is never bad or cheap XD
the denark village reinds me of a minecraft village
9:03 nah man that's just straight up disrespect Didn't like that one jj
Please tell me the people on that bus have been compensated for having to deal with KSI while they probably just wanted to go on a lovely peaceful trip
harry looks so leng today
2:16:47😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can never understand what so good about the good team it just seems boring😂
I’m sorry Toby is just wallpaper in the background
NOO this pisses me the F OFF !!! I’m going to stop watching this BS sidemen IF EVERYTIME KSI IS ON THE GOOD TEAM 9 out of 10 times 😡 ITS A SET UP AND NO IM NOT OVERREACTING why does Josh have to decide and he CLEARLY FAVORS KSI OVER EVERYONE ELSE co ck su ckers JJ IS THE MOST ANNOYING AND OVERRATED WHILE VICK GET THE WORST VACATIONS
KSI should get a forfeit when he whines
Vik is getting really bitter and cringe in these, actually becoming a difficult watch!
Damn the way JJ acts these days is disgusting. Humble yourself
Why is this on gqtiss’ music playlist?
The POV of Harry running over that bridge killed me 😭
this video is stupid , i dont like simon vik and harry they stupid , why did jj leave stupid video man
“I’m still shooting” had me going 😂
9:18 man why did you do the poor guy like that, he just wanted a picture
JJ wont be fighting Jake Paul anytime soon, he's busy losing a battle to cholesterol
I ❤Harry 😂
So has become fatneek again
I love the content, its so wholesome seeing the boys have fun!  But in a way I'm sad, I understand that they were most likely tired from filming and doing the tasks that were set out for the day but the fact that they couldn't admire/appreciate the beautiful view of the valleys between the hills that they were staying on, even without sunshine, really saddens me.   Most people would only ever dream of going to a place like that, and i have a feeling it wouldn't be cheap either.
I would love to see Vik in a huge mansion but he never gets to shine
How are the teams being chosen? Why is vik always on the bad team?
Surprising how out of touch  JJ/Ethan have gotten now that they’re famous…don’t forget where you started
vik is TIRED from carrying the bad team LET HIM RELAX
JJ on the zip line reminds of of the old KSI playing that horror game with Deji lol
Didn´t know Tobi and Ethan would form such an iconic duo
I wouldn't mind a zerkaa vs sdmn holiday Edit: Wouldn't mind a zerkka and tbjzl vs the rest
1:16:19 smelling the sock is crazy work Harry
1:16:19 did Harry smell the Fkn sock😭😭😭
ksi defo bought that gaff after filming 😂😂😂
2:16:42 PMS
1:17:05 Harry just holding the sock is hilarious
like the part at 1:51:26 when Vik says "show me what you got" like in that rick n morty episode with the giant heads.
the man in the suit looked like vladamir putin ngl and ksi's reaction to no driver is sooooooooooooooooo funny
1:04:56 bro got jumped 💀
These videos are great cuz even them as rich people get to live through what not so rich people live with.
C'mon boys let my man vik enjoy the good team once 😭
3 hour vid was a grear idea
That last Vik line, in the dark, was SO northern 😂😂
JJ dancing for good food is literally me. 🤣
Whats the song on the begining called
KSI sounds like he moaning half the video
JJ is a spoilt brat
which country is this
"What are we sucking?"- JJ 😂😂😂
How are brits so bad at everything🤣 rock climbing, monkey bars, bar crawling, food making.
2:13:03
has there ever been a ethan, harry, jj team combo??
8:52 all i got from this was ‘expensive bums dont know how to behave or treat normal people’
can't lie jj was really disrespectful to the geezers on the bus
Music selection in this video was elite ❤‍🔥
The German guy made the video 😂
ngl, this felt like a movie coz it was so long, amazing editing by the way
2:16:45 Freezy?
casper carried
it`s actually crazy
Why’s Jj so annoyingly loud for no reason
This video was soo good! Ending gave such real feel good vibes with amazing ending! Well done gents!
Whys no one talking about ethans and KSI games lmao
YESSS 3 HOUR VIDEO
sayang sekali video ini tidak bisa aku nikmati karna aku tidak tau mereka ngomong apa,  bisa kah di buat dalam bahasa indonesia 😢
1:55:11
Damn bro think I'm officially too old for this content. Peace
Why always vik gets the bad team😂
Josh should give both team a cheap outings while making both think that the other team is in luxury but the truth is that both have to complete the tasks first to get into the luxury outing
LOVE FROM IND
Currently 10 mins in but I really hope Josh pulls one on them all! As in they all go to the same place and just have one epic holiday, would be a cool video!
What is josh's jacket?
Good vid but not the best holiday vid but josh still cooked tho need another one like another road trip or matchday one again
1:25:19 What is the background music?
Not Harry sniffing the sock
Loving the 3 hour video! The longer the better I reckon. 😊
1:00:05 is the stuff of nightmares man lmaoo
49:42 the camera at harry laid down looks like some murder scene
2:16:41 HARRY 😭😭
Ksi is becoming fat again
what rank are you
8:41 JJ called them NPC's 🤣😭
They should do more of the 3H holiday, had fun watching
what religion is vik
So many bangers this year
It’s good to see vic excelling at a sport and putting the others to shame!
Folk wanna just shut up if your gonna complain just stop watching or stfu
I did not at all appreciate watching all the smoking going on in this video, but other than that I had a great time with these 3 hours and hope to see more super-long videos in the future!
2:51 2:56   8:36   11:15   12:30 12:42   13:51 18:05   31:17 31:19 31:27   33:29 "atom"   33:55 33:58   38:14 38:22   39:33 beautiful shot   39:49 39:54 30 btw   41:01   41:21 41:29 41:42   42:14   42:23 42:20  42:43   43:03   43:16   44:59 45:09 45:13 45:22 45:25   47:37 burn   50:01 LOL   50:30   50:55 no mercy   51:25   55:45   56:47 56:49 harry hates denmark   1:00:40   1:01:48 cold vik  1:08:08 1:08:13  1:10:28  1:11:11 simon’s such a troll LOL  1:11:34  1:24:40  1:25:53 LOL  1:26:05  1:26:29 YESSS  1:27:50  1:29:18  1:31:49  1:33:07 1:33:15  1:34:55  1:35:53 thats so mean  1:37:06  1:46:55  1:47:43  1:48:00  1:49:36 LOL 1:49:43  1:51:02  1:53:12 1:53:18  1:54:49 1:54:53  1:55:14  1:55:49  1:56:40   2:03:18   2:03:43 2:03:52   2:05:34 2:05:38   2:08:38 2:08:45   2:11:35   2:18:12 2:18:20 2:18:26 2:18:37 2:18:39   2:20:50   2:26:20   2:28:51   2:35:16 2:35:25   2:35:29 LOL   2:35:54 2:35:59 2:36:08 2:36:26 2:36:33  2:35:54 - 2:36:40 Content   2:37:26   2:38:14   2:38:54 - 2:39:20   2:39:36 pause 2:47:02 2:47:21 2:47:45 2:47:50  2:49:03 that was sick  2:44:26 LOL   2:44:35 LOL   2:45:53   2:46:08 2:46:12 LOL   2:46:30 now its getting good   2:47:54   2:48:26   2:49:47   2:50:10    1:36:44 - 1:37:59   2:11:09 sideboys   2:13:26   2:16:39
Vik is the funniest by far man he makes me die
1:25:23 song name ??
KSI rarely gets put on the bad team because he just acts like a Diva, screaming and complaining saying that hes too good for whatever "bad team" activities are in store and brings the overall vibe down, getting pretty annoying not even in an entertaining way
can someone tell me who tf is this keith guy constantly being mentioned in the videos?
nah i swear im the only mf that caught the Rick and Morty joke at 1:51:30
stopped watching when ksi started crying "im too rich for this"
The NPC comments to that lad on the bus were a bit much.
Ngl Harry getting pressured to drink was really bad form
Did you know that npc in video games mean non-playable character
36:22 I thought Simon was going to get sniped😂
JJ is such a diva
15:53 😂
Just waiting for jj’s OF
not the only bridge on a mountain there is also one in Bad Gastein in Austria
Feelsbad for vik man, honestly he was the most positive person the whole trip and ends up not getting a vote quite unfortunate also I think he has the most bad teams too
1:07:38 that guy is definitely dutch haha
What a wholesome ending
Kashper back!!!
Harry hates Denmark 😱 I really like Harry, but Im born, and live in Denmark, and it is a great country ❤ he should just give it a chance 😁😅
Ksi smiling as he types his next crypto pump and dump scam 😂
Bro the bad team actually kinda nice I'd spend 200 to stay there
1:14:48 why dose bro look like a fish 😭😭😭
This felt like a movie cross vlog/ sidemen sunday. Some of the edits and just the production value was amazing, and the content itself was genuinely so enjoyable. Loved seeing Tobi learn to ski, and the whole of 'JJ's downfall' was great 😂😂
Please do a sidemen sleepover
Buy some gymbles guys🌝
Ethan and harry did better than those 3 vginas swimming
You guys couldve brolen the slide with 3 ppl in it
56:47 he is so honest lol
The german dude is a better teacher than the gold medallist or whatever
2:51:30 Vik voted Tobi 3/10 as a sidemen member??? I thought he liked Tobi more than Josh, JJ and Simon!
KSI is such a pos 😂. Him on the bus was so cringe. Can’t believe ppl act like that. He’s irrelevant at this point but still acts like a god
Ethans camera angle was hilarious
How is ksi a boxer and he cant even do the monkey bars
Cant be asked cant be bothered cant breathe
2:12:32
Casper is my new favourite
The way ksi treats people is pretty mean
Just wow
The plot twists this video were amazing. Some of them I honestly didn't expect!
1:16:18 Nah bro I saw that you thought you was slick huh
Vikk actually is so majestic, there's something about him
nah vik not getting any votes was so sad 😭😭😭😭😭
1:16:17 harry sniffed the sock
the editors cooked fr
dude harry smelling the sock😂 1:16:18
Eight days later I still haven’t finished this video yet I’m still eating dinner also I’m terrified of heights these videos give me second hand anxiety when they do stuff like the cable cars
You should do cheap vs expensive hike
Vikk has no point being here and sometimes in the group as well
omggggg i loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee your videos plsssss i love to jizz on ur vids innit fam blud aaahhhh ahhhh ahhhhh ahhhhh ahhhh ayhhhh                     ]\
Was Casper crushing on vik😭😭
can jj stop being a big baby when he is in the cheaper team, dude is 30 some, cheaper teams aint bad most of the times, expensive ones are more luxurious but its just him making himself feel bad in the most childish way its annoying. he’s annoying in either team. it is only in these type of videos where jj annoys me. (ik what i say doesn’t matter but just had to vent cause of how annoyed i am)
They better put Vik in a good team!
fatneek is back
Great video boys!!!
Vik rlly does do that thing 😂😂😂😂😂😂
KSI "I am too rich for this" I LIKE THAT.
Wonder if Freezy drank JJ's piss from the stream
This Josh Bradley Fellas one hell of a director!! 2:59:56
I 100% know that Vik would have loved the slopes the good team were going down at the end of the vid.
Like if you think KSI is scared to fight Jake Paul
Vik deserved to be in the good team man, none of them voting for him was disappointing, hopefully in the next one Vik is on the good team❤
The body guard needs more love
1:57:46
Whats crazy is the bad team being up in the switzerland mountains at a cabin near a ski resort is on my bucket list and they are bummed.
2:33:26 I’m at a funeral rn Tobi
9:26
Disappointed in the Troops's scare tactics and the camera men don't know how to be sneaky. That section could have been so much more funny
Wouldve been better if kk had good both times it makes it hilarious
Harry going for a sniff of the sock is goated
23:53 Among us in Real life goes crazy
I love Casper
live laugh john on cam
At the dining ethan look like Jesus 😂
Host again zerkka😂😂
Cool
12M views on a 3 hour video, the CPM must be through the roof
Vik is the main character in this vid
Took me a while to find time to watch this 3 hour movie but it was so nice to watch! Wish I could visit this place sometime
How many likes for Good team , bad team and Josh and tobi team
Put Vik on the good team and never remove him from now on. He deserves it ❤
Poverty ksi in your the holidays Aaaaaaaaaa
Who ever watched this in one go are goats 🐐
The guy who asked for a picture.... If I were him I'd crawl under the seat and cry. Wtf JJ and Ethan were doing
Surprised they didnt get hit with copyright for the copyrighted music
2:16:40
👏👏👏👏
Come on boy😂😂😂😂
Banger video
harry sniffing a sock wtf
That olabunji bloke doing well for himself
2:46:50 - 2:50:00 best scenes😂
1:00:00 WTF was that angle😂
My guy JJ looking super thiccc.  Buddy's next fight must be at heavyweight eh.  Looking like Violet Beauregarde on the slopes.
Literal best video of all time
2:58:00 lmfao yall killed it with this video, love nothing more than seeing the boys going on trips having a good time.
1:29:16
5:53 The fact that the other people started clapping intentionally to instigate is hysterical
Cashpa you are an absolute legend 😂😂😂 he made this video great for sure!
Imagine hearing "NOOOO IM TO RICH FOR THIS" on public transportation.
Can’t lie the end just shows Vik don’t vibe with the sidemen
As a South African, I just know I would die during European winters
Vik with the “ski into them” comment reminds me of Winston from New Girl. Either doesn’t take the prank far enough or takes it too far 😂😂😂
OMG we need more videos like this its was a 3hr treat like a fun chill movie.. please sidemen make more of these plzzzz
2:16:40 I'll see this in my nightmares
Naah ksi get back in the gym man
YA!
This is definitely the best sidemen video yet. More enjoyable than the europe holiday, even more enjoyable than the america holiday. I broke it into smaller parts to make it watchable but it divides pretty nicely into the first night, second day plus smaller sections for the journey there and the second night. Josh proving himself the best planner yet again.
3 hour sideman Sunday. Movie night sorted 🩵
”Have another shot” ”No I’m still shooting” 😂😂😂 gold
I'm convinced that Josh extremely hates JJ 😂😂 is not even funny and doesn't even pretend
Harry always says he's autistic but just from this vid alone i think freezy is the autistic one, He ruins every sidemen vid he's in
I was hoping Simon's team would be good but actually I think it's for the better that KSI isn't on the bad team again. 3 hours of him moaning would be unbearable.
14:15 the silence😂😂😂😂
😢😢
😢😢
😢😢
😢😢
40:15
How come Harry never gets into the gud team
Bro Tobi was not getting a massage, he was definitely hitting that synchronized swimmer with the gymnast skills just before she came out to dance.
1:00:00 nahhh that angle had me dead 😂😂😂😂
the part with the dancers in the pool is so awkward why did they do that? it’s just grown men watching the dancers
harry actually smelt the sock
The skiiing instructor needs to invited again in the future 😂😂
1:29:43
1:29:17
That was insulting from ksi lol
How did you guys get the chance to play copyrighted music in the video? Awesome movie btw!
why was ksi so mean to the people on the bus
55:19 Just for the record Harry, the yellowing around your eyes could also possibly be a genetic thing bought about by stress cause I have that condition as well, I thought it was some kind of liver thing but I took a blood test and they told me what it was so I wouldn’t worry too much
55:19 Just for the record Harry, the yellowing around your eyes could also possibly be a genetic thing bought about by stress cause I have that condition as well, I thought it was some kind of liver thing but I took a blood test and they told me what it was so I wouldn’t worry too much
2:16:40 I was having lunch, but watching this I laughed so hard I nearly choked 😂😂
got the boost boysss @2:06:06
40:11
When Harry got mad while he was trying to eat and watch something on his phone 🤣🤣 That's me when I'm on my lunch break and people are trying to talk to me.
and jerk it out yall cooking with this music 🔥
right here right now by fat boy slim yesss
This is by far the second best sidemen video ever After the other cheap v expensive one that got 200mil views
The bad team was like REALLY bad this time lol. Felt for the boys, especially Vik he's such a nice guy
this is one boring a** video
2:34:47 ghost in the background??
Greatest Sidemen video in awhile keep them coming also amazing how josh finds these places!!
i’ve been watching this for every meal since last week and i’m still not finished 😭😭😭
I think Harry is the funniest person in the world hahahaha when he’s running on the bridge with the 360 camera😂
3 hour video is wild
KSI and Ethan makes fun while tobi is chilling hwhaha
The cut of Harry running across the bridge had me crying 😂
lets cancel ksi
command didnt type
v
lets cancel ksi
lets cancel ksi
lets cancel ksi
lets cancel ksi
lets cancel ksi
lets cancel ksi
lets cancel ksi  lets cancel ksi
lets cancel ksi
Nah i weight to much 😂😂😂
57:13 Ethan didnt even attempt the set climb 😂  Toby has climbed before that abseil was legit, auto belays aren't easy if you haven't used them.
The best holiday vid
You boys are stacking strain up ay gotta love vik😂😂😂😂
1:04:55 swear down that guy got taken out by security 😂
2:11:08 this is the highlight 😂😂😂
JJ is insufferable.
Josh trying to get Harry to drink was the highlight
Anybody wants some haribos more for mee😂😂😂
the sleepover part was the part
I play Cashpur, thanks for all the love Sidemen fans. More funny Cashpur content on my channel 🏂😎
JJ living my dream but crying on that amazing slope…. 😮
JJ back to being fat neek
Last 10 minutes was the best part
Ksi looking big 😂
Bro watching the eating parts whilst fasting kills me man 😂I
Ksi is a not humble , egotistical, cry baby who thinks he is superior to people who aren’t rich. Disgusting that sidemen find it funny. Says a lot
I think Harry might be afraid of heights because of all those plane crash videos he loves to watch lol :) as always a great video guys keep it up!
I love Vik when he's comfortable to be himself he's so funny.
Nah it’s more wholesome with the sleepover 🥹 took me 9 days to watch this but the cheap team had a better ending 😂
1:16:20 Harry caught in 4K
vikk is always super positive...i hope i see him on the good team once freely
loving our fatneek being a fatneek again
Why is JJ wearing green in the thumbnail but blue in the video?
I'm dying! The instructor is funny af.🤣😂😂
They’re playing so many big songs in vids now. Don’t they get copyrighted
25:13 That hasss to be clipped
The boys made it funny at bed time great addition
Why Harry is sniffing random woman sock?
Bhai yaar tum please apna website thik karo  Kisi UI/UX wale ko hire karo
Harry looked like a "Fall Guy" character running across that suspension bridge
Literally the most entertaining channel on YouTube. Thank you boys for so many hours of free entertainment. Seriously you guys rock.
what happened to simon from 1:47:30 to 1:51:00
so did jj get like a red card for not staying at the air bnb?
The cut at 2:46:40 from a creepy cold go pro on the roof of a cabin in the middle of the woods, cutting to them in a mansion doing poses in swim caps next to an indoor pool had me ABSOLUTELY DEAD! xDDD
ksi would be the super villain who monologues how to beat him XD
Really, nobody noticed that harry sniffed the sock at 1:16:18?
next time im at a bar with red wine im asking for a Brexit bertha XD
the camera guy who held the letter for dramatic effect is a genious XD
the woman server smirking while saying the rich people "uhu" then on request made me geek XD
Aww, the ending was so wholesome 🥹 Took me like 5 days to finish all of it haha but worth it at the end, very wholesome 😁👏
I just want to know what Vik/ Harry/ Simon were wearing, I want one for my next ski trip!!!
Poor Steve
bus rides go crazyy 🫨
It's a pain to watch JJ.. He is so childish that he ruins it for everyone!!
2:30:31
The last part when the boys hug just melt my heart…
Ngl the ending with all the boys on the bad team was peak like highschool sleepover but as just a bunch of late 20-30 year old men 😭😂
I think there should be a sidemen Sunday where they do Taskmaster style escape rooms or challenges
It was like watching Attack on Titan when JJ was doing the obstacle course via the view from the camera on his head XD
Idk who the guide was for the losing team during skiiing, but keep him on. He’s amazing
Worth the 3 hours ....
the movie like production was so fire, the editors and videographers are cooking a lil too much
Did noone see Harry have a smell of that woman's sock 😂😂
In loving memory of Steve. Never forget
I got so hyped when JJ found out that he was on the good team ❤❤❤
1:18:46 that was cold
1:16:09 just casually smells the sock
harry's intrusive thought of sniffing the women's sock just got me laughing dude😂
That was the longest ultimate sideman and food video
I haven’t watched any vids for a month and apparently they’re making whole films now
endlessly bullying VIK - I'm here for it.
The production for this was amazing! by far one of my favourite sidemen sundays!!
Was that girl who took her socks off
sidemen offroading trip !!!!!! come on boys
Hey I don't know if you guys know this, but y'all had snipers on you. Stay safe out there
i just realized i gave away 3 hours of my life for this...pure entertainment.
JJ looking like the fish meme with big lips under the water 😅
Can anyone tell me the name of the place in switzerland where harry team was?
2:58:00 this was the good team actually!!!
#JUSTICEFORVIK
The fact that this video is the length of 2 movies
I know I’m about to get rinsed for being American but I was so confused when the boys were referring to “sledding” as “sledging”. Almost like a sledgehammer? Why is the english language so confusing lmao.
Am I the only one who thinks Simon’s team was fire? Yeah sweet 😂
bro i was drinking a drink and couldn't stop laughing at when ksi called the man a npc and spat my drink on my commuter and broke it
Tobi being in sync with Ethan and jj at once😂 1:28:10
I love Vik man
1:16:15  Sniffing that sock aye?
Lmfao Europe night life look so lame. Unless, they always go where it’s never lit.
Where is kon at?
I feel like their cheap holiday’s are our holidays on the regular
Harry smelling the sock at 1:16:19 is crazy-
The ending was so awesome. Brought me back to when the boys and I would sleepover. Well done. Nice touch.
Imma just say it. They should’ve just left jj out of this one
2:16:45 😂
2:12:45 is just absolutely phenomenal...the bridge omg ❤❤
1:11:50 man as a french speaker  and a sidemen fan, thats hilarious
The editing from exactly halfway through this video is elite
JJ stop being a sookie bubba 🤬 ffs
vik was so sweet in this vid love him
1:01:40  the edit of JJ 😂😂😂😂
might genuinely be top 5 sidemen vid of all time
Run This Vid 🆙 For Ma Boys  @Sidemen Everyone Plz 3:16
Next one: Vik - has the best experience ever with everything he wants  Expensive team  Cheap team Josh - has a literal tent in the middle of nowhere
We need more content as long as this
Master has given Harry (dobby) a sock
BTW why don't you guys have seatbelts on???
I didnt realize this was 3 hours long. Love it
58:49, thé Finishing Line in the Top Gear Race to Verbier 😅
Amazing vid
gotta love Kasper
Finland mentioned RRAAHHHHHH🦅🦅
What a banger
its absurd how many ads there are
1:16:18 Harry caught in 4k
2:40:45 Josh... just why? 🤣 That ending, was amazing. Whatever the situation, if you are there with 5 of your mates it just becomes hilarious.
SO BAD
W video W production W end
Cashpur is a goated character man lol
I’m so glad they brought Casper back!! He was great in the other video
All those other passingers on the buss that paid their year worth of savings just to listen KSI yell the whole trip how bad and cheap the trip is.
This vid was 30 mins too long
new vid idea: boys have a sleepover for 48 hrs
W Production! 🔥
For the health of everyone we the fans wouldnt mind if the drinking stopped. Its hard to see harry being forced to drink for the sake of content :(
The fact that Jj doesn’t stay at the bad team kinda defeats the purpose of him being on the bad team Ik he’s rich and famous and whatever but everyone else stays when here on the bad team
Casper was honestly a great addition to the video 😂😂his chemistry with JJ was too funny
They have to use the KSI screaming in wet sauna sound for something. That was clean
These videos take me like a week to watch 😂 so by the time I’ve finished it the new one is coming out
Shut up Vikk.  Harry was annoying with the lists but Vikk never stops crying.  Even when Josh was on bad teams he never complained and Ethan having that long bad team run...I'd honestly always have Vikk on the bad team cuz he never stops complaining.
Man this was a movie😊
this is a sick video
Josh Cooked🔥 The bridge drone shot 🥶
I love how the Ski instructor was basically just like a bro to JJ 😭
the sleepover was highkey the best part
It's their laughter that gives me laughing fits 😂
Man like vajajay 😂😂
jj always being lazy when he is in a bad team😂
Ik KSI plays a character but he was quite distasteful at times.
That vikk star joke at the end is one of the funniest things he’s ever said😂😂
“Give em a good night kiss. That was a bit weird.” Ma guy has some serious issues 😂😂
Hickories steakhouse for video idea
Good team for vik
To think how much they’re all worth and how they’re all in a dinghy shallot 😂 love it!
The 3 Nigerians carried this vid bro
Vikk 😢😢
2:12:40 i just love this scene in particular in sense of the shots from the sidemen videos...i watch this part regularly since the video came out and my mind just can't take it all in...its incredible just wow
This is one of the best sidemen videos
I'm constantly baffled as to how JJ isn't embarrassed to be acting like a toddler having a meltdown
Everything was fun until i saw callux
1:18:28
I am from denmark
This video went straight clear
An absolute banger of a Sidemen Sunday vid
Best video most entertaining video fo me this was a banger this should be top 5 on trending
35.15 ksi just push tobi
Fatneek is back 😊
Never thought that day Ethan and Harry would compete in a dancing swimming competition. Still It's kinda fun to watch.
2:12:19  this moment right here is my favourite and the most beautiful moment of the whole sidemen
Come on guys you think I would be raicist them……………………..
32:40 siuuuuu
this gotta be the best sidemen video ever😭😭everything is soo wholesome, we need more 3 hours vid
I lived in Geneva lol this is interesting
Anyone else see Harry smell the sock at 1:16:22 🤣🤣
i feel so bad for vik fr i think the first time vik gets the good team it needs to be the ultimate vaca like the best fr #ultimatevikvaca
Vik CARRIED!!!
Imagine you and your friends all become super rich and travel the world together, so amazing to watch
115
1:46 thank God they swaped
Why does JJ just act like a spoilt baby, “I’m too rich for a hostel” like grow up, whinging in the snow like enjoy the time with your mates and experience regardless of if you’ve done it before or have enough money to do it. If I was on that bus and heard him say “I’m too rich” I would knock him out
nobody gonna talk about Harry smelling the sock he got 1:16:17
Who else wanted  that top trumps game to be the whole video
That little groupe hug at the end was so wholesome and JJ even suggested it😮😂 This one really was like a film, it was fantastic🙏🙏 Love these kind of videos boys keep producing vids at this kaliber and you will hit 30 mil at the end of the year, easy🙏🙏💪😅All love Sidemen❤️❤️❤️❤️
The clip of JJ starting 2:07:21 almost had me in tears, every word generates a new drop of spit on his lips 😂
One of the best video. Really sad to see vik not getting what he deserves
1:41:00
A movie! A Sidemen Movie! Big credits to @Zerkaa and the crew. 1mil+ likes has to be done!
JJ doin too much
Where was Simon for half the second day?
its always a pleasure to come back after a short while and enjoy these videos! these guys are 50 y/o and still dropping bangers, hats to them for all of these ideas, videos that looks the same but they are not because of the ingenuity of the team behind and the guys!!!
The bedt video with the cinematics and all of that
I was praying that the bad team got to their sleeping arrangement and Casper was there. I think JJ would’ve cried
lOVED IT best video i have ever seen, and the outro with that roling text danm. Absolut BANGER
1:10:26 Huh???
1:01:10 violation
1:24:05 I can confirm this is true
50:57 true evil in action
1:16:20 smelling the sock it's the most harry's thing 💀
#StopTheVikAbuse
The music editing in this video is immaculate
What does “stacking strain up” mean?
best vid yet
The editor is amazing
Vik  after seeing the troopss said its  the good team now lets partyyyy!
We needddd more of thesee. And this vid should be the most viewed video on the channeellll
😂haha the hobbit song when day two started
Nah JJ is cracking me up😂
55:33
Paradise at 2:12:42 hit HARDDDDD
the rich team is so 😪😪😪
2024 is defo the year sidemen start falling off.
This vid was so mid, damn ⛷️
I want for JJ to be the only one on the bad team and the rest on a good team I want to see JJ suffer alone with the other boys so please make JJ be the only one on the bad team for 1 video  PS make the other guys be on the good team
A beautiful 3 hr MOVIE by the Sidemen, more like was fathered to a  beautiful dream in here..  Vik being an absolute sweetheart 💌 & trying his best to uplift the video of the bad team..  Harry  Ethan & Tobz what  a trio 🧏🏻.. JJ making the instructor overwork ☠😅
Anyone know what country they were in?
what a movie
nice one guys... nice one.. good video
Simon always wins rps
1:53:13 yeah, he's a real 🐱-o, the fact that he's come so far in life(money wise) is a miracle...
3 atoms sir, water has 3 atoms. H2O- 2 hydrogen &1 oxygen. 2 +1 =3. 3 atoms.
18:39 ain't no way I wanted to see jj suffer.
3:00:27 “Cheap team, but you guys are priceless”🥶
JJ got so fat lol
Why does ethans laugh sound like elmo...
Love this video! 100/10! We need the summer version of this
Idk why Ethan is complaining about Tobi getting the good time most of the times.. he hasn’t had a bad team experience in sooo long😂
I think its really  interesting how the cheap team always gets to have fun on the streets in social situations laughing together with strangers and the rich team is "alone" in a mansion. And in the moments both seem to have the same amount of fun no matter if they on the cheap or the expensive team
ethan and jj definitely have one brain cell between them😭
Ending was the best
Idk $200 team seemed like more fun😅
1:08:16 Our Fatneek
do denmark next
2:16:46 thank me later
1:53:00 Vik starfish
54:01 felt so sorry for em
1:38:50 I felt like different types of snow were being talked about here 😂
Bro sidemen came to watch Farnham play jersey bulls
2:38:45 Hold upp,did cal actually drink jj's piss😭
is this the start of a new era? maybe theyll start making 2-3h videos, once a month. and honestly, i would not complain
Best video of all time love the long form video , it was like a movie and when you get to this level of production and editing it’s perfect
ethan acts like ronald
1:14:40 😂😂
😂😂 the ending loved this video
Sidemen Sundays are cooking
Absolute banger!
nahhhhh imagine being on the bad team and for a suprise randolph walks in............... id be fuming
I love how toby is so positive all the time and especially when he said I can tell my mum i can ski ❤
Casper was something else!!! 😂😂 What a guy!!
3 hour video wtf
this is a movie
ngl i LOVED vikks energy and vibes this whole video!!! i feel like there wasnt that akwardness there always seems to be between him and the boys, it was just nice
ngl, the pool scene was weird
The instructor calling Vik “Vicky” had me dying hhh
Erm can we talk about how the ski trainor on the bad team was smoking a joint
Nah fatneek is back
42:58 this could be a meme😂
They don't appreciate vik. He should leave sidemen.
Congratulations @Zerkaa you can host again!!🎉
NAHHHH Randy COOKED 🤣🤣
Probably the best sidemen vid ever. The quality was amazing ❤
Josh Bradley is a different gravy 🔥
Bro we need 20 women vs 1 sidemen: Vik Edition
Hi
shouldnt ksi be at back of the bus?
10/10 sidemen sunday. Im so moved
Why’s ksi always tryna be the centre of attention 😹😹😹
Damn Cashpur is strong
Stuttgart?
HARRY SNIFED THE SOCK LOLLLLLL
Imagine seeing 6 lads walk out of a cabin wearing those types of clothes
You should send them to Canberra and do a yr6 camp experience and like do cheap vs expensive one team in Canberra one team in Sydney or Melbourne
2:16:40 "Calfreezy on a night out"
w
I envy this cause we had 0 winter precipitation this year and I'm salty
I wish they put kasper on the zip line with jj 😆
❤vicky❤😂
Since when are samsung users npcs?
1:16:18 Harry fully sniffed that random woman's sock XD
Why Harry act like he hasn't had the most good teams out of everyone. Makes me respect Vik and Simon more especially when they actively tried to do challenges in the Europe one.
I felt so bad for harry in this one❤ they shouldn't make him drink
Bro these guys trying way too hard now. Vids just boring af
no disrespect buy ksi not taking part in activites is borin (looks egoistic ngl)
I love these videos
JJ just pisses me off now he’s so rude
I dont watch much Sidemen content because Jayjay is just annoying
2:16:30 attack on titan
how tf did i watch all 3 hours of this. Justice for Vik
2:16:40 The AOT run by Harry!!🤣🤣🤣
Best upload in a while 🙌🏽🙌🏽 josh really does make the best vids and content for the sidemen, he never fails as host🎉
Why is it every single trip I watch from you guys has JJ on the good team. Let the man be on the bad team. Vikk, Harry, and Simon always seems to get screwed. Come on!!!!
This video is insane! Levelled up even more since the documentary
At next holiday video u should have like 3 teams lol
Sidemen create a video where all the 7 members should wear women's dress for a day
Looking at all the positive comments about Vik just fills me with rage
Video is hilarious but for the love of god editors we need the vik camera time to be cut erratically he’s extremely unfunny especially when he’s complaining. Thank you
the ski instructor is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
2:16:40 that gave me quite the spook lmao
The ending was amazing. The bad teams spirit was lifted ❤
norway men oml
Tobi is so adorable 😭 I want him 🥺
Toby beat JJ and Ethan doing the obstacle course with only 22 seconds, Thats how you know being a "Man Of God" proves you're the miracle.
More 3 hours content please
Sidemen sleepover funny asf
The instructor and JJ are the duo I didn't know I needed 🤣🤣🤣
in what universe is that a $200 holiday?
I don’t like how Josh was peer pressuring the team to drink when they all said they didn’t want to
The sleepover part had me dying of laughter 😂😂, made me feel like i was there with them.
The best part was the sleepover 😂 2:57:08
Harry smelling the sock of that girl is crazy 💀💀💀
Me personally I love cheese so I would've been very appreciative of the cheese wheel
Jj is really annoying
w
I love you lot walahi
JJ mouth on 2:07:27
Not cool that I need to open vpn just to watch your videos 😢
Randy is the friend we all need 🙌🏼🤣
"nah brother said hostel" 😂😂😂😂
Best sidemen video in a long long time
Think this might be the longest sidemen video
That was a great ending.
We need more cashper camios😂😂
What a production
man Jj puts on weight fast af
The way the “poor” team were so rude and diminishing to people who may have saved a long time to go skiing as it’s so expensive, made me lose all respect for them. Remember where you came from and don’t be so stuck up and rude.
I’m serious 💀😂
Where is the bad team at?? I want to go for a trip :)
Did anyone see harry sniff the sock???????
Epic intro song choice! Well done!
2:16:41 is an abnormal titan😂😂😂
fatneek is back no way
ksi is very wealthy he reacts like this imagine we go to those types of trips
Loved the vid!!
that’s crazy, 3 hour sidemen video equals to credits
2:08:37 low key JJ overdramatising everything isn’t even funny anymore
i’m a bit shocked at JJ on the coach… that poor guy who wanted a pic 😢😂
simon at 1:11:45 with that look on his face as he waits for reactions lol
KSI, Ethan & Harry were hilarious in the vlog 🤣🤣🤣 fantastic vlog 👏
What is that called at 46:50?
Legit Movie ❤
Nothing like hearing rich people complain
Clicks video sees its Joshs vid, time for a banger i guess
the credits!!! loved the addition
Why tf did Harry smell the sock😂😂😭😭😭😭😭
Harry sniffed the sock 😭
Cameraman John doing Maldives the other week and now this. Man I'm in the wrong career
Why didn't Simon ski?
Idk why the end credits made me feel some type of way. Came so far from the start. Love the 3 hour content- took a few watching but couldnt stop. Thanks boys
2:43:06 josh is gonna drive vikk crazy with these vids
they should do one where they BOTH get the good team
Strange to make us wonder who’s in the good team when it’s in the thumbnail
42:14 1:14:35 1:16:47
The bad team would be a luxury for me 💀
Is ksi getting fat again
Taking a photo: 😃😮 😃
Luv cabin
I think this might be one of the rare occasions where the good team has better moments then the bad team except the last 10mins. Amazing 😂
2:07:31 JJ's face🤣
They cut the best part short ending was hilarious
Thiis the most boring vid
2:40:00 that’s a man fighting for his life right there.
jj needs to get humbled and be on the bad team as much as harry and vik for a while before getting on the good team again to learn and appreciate it
How can they say that’s bad it’s gorgeous there. Can’t imagine getting paid to go on holiday…
editor is sick
boring vid ngl
these videos would be so much better without ksi
Where was Simon while JJ and Vik were with the instructor
20v1 with lando norris please
Nah the Skeeing part I would have taken the bad team any day, good team looked TERRIFYING
510,000 likes currently with 10 million views on a 3hr video. When Josh cooks its always a banger
the ended of this is just levels the way they zoomed out, made me feel like i was watching a movie
The way Casper says “YEAAA” every single time 😭😭 wholesome
3h vid? jesus mate
I never comment but this genuinely made me happy. Big Ups!
first
Yeah it wasn’t that good 😂                              Jk
hahahah
How are they so rude to ppl and they don’t give a damn.
can you come to my house i want to film a football video with you guys
Sidemen should do like last to leave circle in team where team nominate someone for challenge and the winner team win the next  expensive holiday experience  and get to decide loosing team holiday experience for next video
2:21:33 wait 6days later and im just tryna figure out if this beverage was alcoholic or not😂
2:58:13 the laugh was amazing from the camera guy😂😂😂
Great video keep up what yall do 🫶🏻
side men you guys are just fantastic love it as per usual such a laugh .   BIG FAN . you keep me young dudes
This took me 4 days to Watch 😂
1:06:01 then tbjzl got a suckie wuckie real good
That ending tho❤
Prime is water 33:18 😂
One day a switch will come depending on jjs reaction. If he starts chatting too much the teams will swap I’m calling it
ksi bulking szn!
WE GOT 500k LIKES JOSH IT WAS FOR YOU 😍😍😍
JJ IS INSUFFERABLE
I rather go to heaven mountain it called Uhud don't tell anyone guys.

1:07:25 gotta be the wholesome moment 😂❤️ Reason why Cheap team always have best moments
that josh and tobi bias goin outta hand
Imagine sidemen being on last breath and these beautiful videos best moments compilation start playing....this is what life is beautiful ❤️
Jj is so obnoxious
Thumbnail already reveal expensive team
The best sidemen Sunday in the last 2 years 🥲
LOVED THE CREDITS. Shows just how much work goes behind each video and its nice to see the names of the people who are behind this epic video!
1:17:38 😂😂😂 1:26:03 his reaction 2:15:44 vik flying 2:16:40 😂😂 2:24:20 just 4 grown men going to a slide 😂 2:29:23 😂 2:31:40 the background music is amazing ! 2:33:31 😂😂 2:46:06 😂😂 2:58:02 this conversation 😂😂😂
Anyone else think cashper was Phil?
Nah, now i know for sure when vik is gonna be the host, they all gonna be on a bad team and vik is just chilling😂
Jj is the friend that will make you feel poor even tho you rich😂😂
I love how Tobi’s gave skiing a proper try unlike JJ 😭😭
Can someone tell me as I'm slightly unaware about it that how Vikk got so rich like he get's compared to JJ?what else he did differently than other sidemens to earn this much worth ..?or he has generational wealth?
2:12:48
part 59:56...makes me want to cry😆🤣🤣...you guys did KSI dirty..🤣🤣🤣
what a banger of a video . 3 hours of absolute gold content
Is nobody talking bout the editing it’s 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why always bad team is good content 🎉
Anyone else bedridden and sick af atm, but enjoying the sidemen vid?
Where can I get ski suits like the "bad" team have? They actually look sick.
From the moment the troops met up to the end of the video was probably my favourite part. Just straight banter all around especially when they went to bed lol
Josh have some issues wih vik . He has to stop . Plz put him in good team
this was has got to be the best sidemen vid ever .
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 5:46
I love KSI and Ethan combo😅
2:19:38 vik looks so disappointed 😢
1:24:43 that was wholesome
i might not have paid attention but where exactly did the good team go to in geneva? writing down places to go
33:44 ⬛️🟧
Simon at 2:10:20 😂
Why do we have a 3 hour movie on this ? 😭😭
This video is the best production I have seen on Youtube by a long shot. Loved it please do more!
Let jj host
¿Por qué estás construido como un Ohio Rizzler Skibi Ohio y no como un Rizz Kai Cenat GYATTTT?
1:55:01 bruh nahhhh
The way Tobi scrapped his face in the snow had me dying 27:48
harry just smelled the sock xddd
Vik is SHINING right now. Not only Quickly becoming the most loved member of the sidemen but also one of the most loved on YouTube. Such a humble and positive bloke!
10 mil plus views for a 3 hour video is just insane.
500k likes goal reached finally ❤️🔥
Cheap team sleepover with the boys vibes were immaculate, wholesome ending
josh skiing is so cool
Bro I love the sidemen so much ❤
Ending was heart warming❤
Why is ksi looks so much more lazy and not as fit in this video 💀
2:16:38
I’m pretty sure the water Cal drank at 2:38:40 was indeed KSI’s piss💀
We ain't talking about why there were a Lazer pointed at there head
World class 🏆
These boys man 😢❤
josh should do a holiday video where theyre both the bad team
HES BOTTLED THE TOP
35:10 JJ making Toby lay down 😂
JJ's face cam during the obstacle course lmao
3hrs is not enough for the fans we need 6hrs😅
As much as it feels like the cheap team got the shprtend of the straw me personally they won. Their experience has been the most realistic and rewarding. Getting out meeting locals, exploring the venues etc. Was a W for me I'd prefer that over being in a house with no one but 3 others and no real experience
I watched this and Barbie before Oppenheimer this is what the sidemen show should’ve been
This sidemen Sunday would’ve been more enjoyable if JJ stopped complaining and actually enjoyed with the boys.
When the guy asked jj if he could get a pic with him and jj called him an npc LMFAO
2:58:13 man this takes me back to doing sleepovers with my homies, literally couldnt sleep because we kept sayin the dumbest stuff as we all were laying in bed 😂
Omgggg there getting old 😢😢
Ksi is fat again
please put vik on the good team next time
Im ngl KSI's disrespect at the start made me internally cringe- can he not get any more disregarding to other people?
The fact there’s a rich team and poor team they both play wavelength 😂😂😂
as a longtime sidemen fan , seeing the bad team cheer up and make a skit after being surprised by the boys made this video a 10/10
We secured Josh anther host!
Keep putting harry in the bad team because he keeps on moaning
Vik’s positive attitude really made up for JJ being somewhat insufferable at times. Most people will never experience this in their lifetime and I think vik truly understands how to get the most out of life because of that fact
Now my favourite movie
Josh: **breathes**  Harry: “I cant be asked”
I actually feel sorry for Vik. He genuinely should've been the person who went to the good team.
bro made an actual movie
1:16:19 *sniff*😅
Idk what it is about being American but hearing a British or Australian person say Jesus is American just makes me rock hard lol 😂
Whyyy did he smell the sock he swapped with the girl, craazy
1:16:19 harry just casually smells the sock, hahahhaha
11:26 they stopped like 3 mins away from where I live, I recognise the mountain and that building. I just thought that was cool lol.
5 days of watching a bit at a time. And still now finished 😂
1:14:42
He’s probably out there cheating on me.  Me and the boys: 2:57:56
1:43:21 Where did Simon go? Suddenly he was gone for a while…
1:17:35 - The video goes 'Bois Bois Bois'
Best Sidemen video yet. Unreal 😂👏
1:18:00 OMG poor woman lol
The ending shows that money cant buy happiness, and in the end I felt that the bad team had overall the most fun experience.
1:47:51  lmaoo the way Vik just plopped onto the snow was so adorable
by the time i've finished the video it's almost time for the next sidemen sunday lmao
It's getting oldthey find a way to get JJ on the bad team in these videos.
It would be a good twist for Josh to get the guys to vote who gets to go to the good/bad team but then after they swap, announce the teams are now the opposite to what they were. This means whoever they thought would be going to the bad team is now back on the good team
The drone shots and level of editing in this was taken to a whole new level
The clip of Harry running across the bridge absolutely sent me. So funny.
Sick video
God dammit man the last part sleep over and ksi laugh reminds me of my sleep overs it was soo whole some and i  JUST LOVE HARRY MAN MY GOD HE IS SOO HARD WORKIN ♥️ sky instructor BEST SIDE CHARACTER
Cashper the ski instructor is hilarious!!!
1:16:19 why did Harry smell the sock 🥺
W ending
anyone else recognise the music at the start from their gcse sports exams ??
Not harry sniffing the sock @ 1:16:00
0014
honestly best sidemen sunday. Definitely in my top 3
why is KSI fat again
1:18:26 gotta be one of the funniest jokes in awhile lmao
8:25   1:51:46
whyd that ending feel like the beginning of the end
Do we think Tobi hooked up with one of the swimmers?
1:16:19 Harry just has to smell the sock to make sure 💀
1:17:30 wait no i just actually just realized this vid is 3hrs long😳ty fr ngl i thought it would end soon
the segment at 1:31 is cinematic genius.
Nicee
Where did they go?
Think their behaviour on the coach at the start was kinda terrible tbh
Do people actually watch all 3 hours
Simon: I don't think I can do this as a 31 year old. Seconds later. Ah my knee 😂
legit feel bad for the hostel folks that were excited and JJ was killing the vibe so bad.
Best ending ever, just like a comedy movie
you copy the Bankzitters, you guys are not original
1:07:46 fatneek has returned
Omg @ticetrip mooie thumbnail! Goed gedaan!
Could we please put the same losing team together now. On the next Sidemem Holiday Vid. It was kinda sad seeing the losing team down like that😔
Good ending
roller coaster of a video. loved it
to be fair, the outfits of harry, vik and simon lowkey were fire
yo i didnt realize i watched 3 hours of this this video was top notch good job guys
you guys gave me a new bucket list
That ending with their backs seeing the view was actually kind of cute :3  A movie feel too
It's just a raw movie at this point
2:50:31 calm down cal
Ethan might be sus 😂
but it's summer
vikk you are a good man, but stfu, accept and stop complaining
what a disappointed to watch ksi.
bad team sweed coach is a goat
56:49 🇩🇰
I will never understand how JJ can lose and pick up weight so quick
2:12:40
3hr long video is crazyy
JJ is so annoying in these holiday vids
So is no one going to bring up the part where Harry smelled that lady's sock... 1:16:19
Water is actually 3 atoms
Would have been hilarious at the end if they brought cashper in when the lights turned off next to JJ 😂😂😂
i love the energy with the sidemen, nice channel!
Vik just laying on his face in the snow 😂😂😂
Not gonna lie jj can be insufferable at times like these guys on the bus ready to have fun while he’s here screaming and calling everyone Npc because “he makes to much money” 9:04
12:12
Nah i am so pissed off tht jj is in the good team
Part.2😂
1:16:16 harry sniffed the sock 😂
Vik is so underrated, the way he tries to find the positive is so adorable, he just wants to have fun
one of the best videos by sidemen
1:10:21 💀💀💀
1:18:24 wtf
yess we hit 500k like now josh can host a video again
Unreal vid
Yes
Where is this amazing placee???
1:16:13 Why did harry smell the womans sock HAHAHAHA
1:16:18 bro sniffed the damn sock
9:30 they didn’t have to do him like that lmaoo
it's just funny to see JJ how he flirts with the food and then lipbite his lips after😅
Absolutely class video guys, well done. My favorite YT channel by a country mile. I envy you guys living it up so bad man, makes me motivated to find a way out of being a wage slave, because it ain't living. Can't wait for next week!
why dose jj have to shout and yell bone head
sidemen editors must’ve had a pay upgrade or smt cos the edits slap
Harry trying to quiet drinking makes me so proud
editors cooked with this one
The sidemen should do a video similar to I’m a celeb, maybe a series like the beta squad did
29:47 If I was sharing a skiing cottage with you I would Harry....
The better version of guess who irl is already available free in beta squad
The cut to harry running on the bridge with the cam in his mouth was Oscar worthy
Colour grading goes hard
Next Europe Cheap vs expensive, whoevers hosting just put Vik on the good team and you know what, Tobi has to have a really bad team experience once, USA and Sweden weren't even bad compared to napa and Benidorm, we want a Tobi rage!!!
is no one gonna mention the fact that harry sniffed the sock?
What’s the time stamp of the fan saying “i want harry, i want harry” ???
Eventually these lads are gonna release a 15 hour video wtf😂😂
Harry looks like that titan that carries equipment on AOT🤣🤣 2:16:41
they cooked
Them not picking vik was like the meanest thing ever. They always say oh yeah vik & tobi, nice guys. But then, when it comes time to pick, they just chose their friends; Instead of picking Vik, who has been consistently on the bad team. Pretty sure Ethan & Tobi chose Harry, and JJ picked Simon.  So so so...... mean.
I'm Boycotting next good team vs bad team if vik is not in good team :(
Wait, have Vik and JJ ever been on the same team? My memory is getting foggy on that...
Why does Ethan look like guy fury
do people actually find ksi funny here? jesus that was the most cringe video ive ever seen of him. like just stop ur not even funny.
Vik is a trooper
3h sidemen Sunday is nice
If Harry doesnt want to drink dont make him
sidemen actually starting to beat the falling off allegations lmao
Why’s the vid 3 hours long
The Sidemen should do a soapbox car challenge for Sidemen Sundays
I am sorry but Vic is the worst sidemen…., I can’t stand him I really hope he gets every bad team. My life I fueled by how bad Vic does.  Also JJ the stuff that is the worse for you is the best for some ppl. Enjoy it bruv
7:17 bro come on dont be rude fam
So is jj
Ethan is my favorite
Best
Jj showing his boxing talent 😂
What all was Tobi doing during the massage 😏
2:58:02 That in-the-dark conversation is what gets me. IDK why
Wow! I love these long videos! 😍
2:32:25 jj wearing right foot's shoe on left and left on right XD
Anyone else hearing the Minecraft music?
It's so funny that JJ the rapper, boxer, whenever he steps into anything else he's just crying on the floor
They literally get more views with Josh as the host
2:16:40 nothing could’ve prepared me for this moment
1:06:00 Nah bro, the way that door closed. That was MEGA sus
Poland challenge get photo with some one made up lewangoalski
Harry SMELLED the sock… lol
2:17:49
Attack on Titan sequel leaked footage 🙀🙀 2:16:40
Honestly that ending with the sleepover was my favourite part from the whole thing, just the genuine laughs and stupidity! The level of editing was so much better too, music and even credits at the end such a small but big difference!
omg 1:44:04
I can tell CASHPA is acting and is not really homo, real homos have bad negative energy, And Cashpa was great and so funny, I already mis him, he should be in more Sidemen videos😮😅
The production on this 😢
This could be an unpopular opinion but Tobi doesn’t bring any value to this video
right when they switched jj to the bad team i left the video
I feel so bad for Vik, I felt like he was holding back tears when he found out he got no votes to join the good team 😭 he doesn’t deserve this
That's actually wild this video took me 4 days to finish, absolutely amazing production by the way!! The longest Sidemen Sunday in awhile if ever.
As soon as I saw ksi was on the good team I didn’t want to watch anymore
Plzzzz we need a sidemen tinder
No one voted for him bro 😂 That was sad thoughb
The cut to the sock on Harry’s boot killed me hahahaa
That last bit thooo ❤❤❤❤❤
This gets me BRICKED
okay jj is kinda ruining vids nowadays
Uh
Potter Payper at 4:48 on the right 😂
You should start doing different challenges and have those challenges based on a point system to decide who is on the good or bad team then there will be motivation to win different challenges instead of giving money prizes which you guys already have plenty of
1:16:17 Harry smells the sock LOOOLLL
Its harry sniffing the sock for me 😂😂
10:00 i just realized vikks back here🌚yeahh abt time yu got back ona slope in these vids🦾
9:33 nahh bro that was genuinely an npc😳bro literally sounded like android 16😬
They should do both bad teams where they each think the other team is the good team 😂😂😂
too predictiable with the team choices. the end was nice tho
This deserves more views
It took me 3 days to finish the video, but it was worth it 😂😅
Am i the only one that gets annoyed anytime KSI is happy. I know he is playing a character but he is just such a douche.
let's think about howto improve this situation ?  Soil is the basis of our lives. But... Agriculture, deforestation, and other factors have degraded and eroded topsoil at alarming rates. Can we improve  this situation ? #savesoil
Alhamdulillah
well tobi just fell and slid on his face i lost it
such a good ending!!
simon acting like he made the "tell a joke and then ask them to explain it"  is crazy, @sidequestz has been doing that for ages bois
One if not the best video
are we all going to ignore that its a 3 hour sidemen sunday?
I truly love the production on this video. A movie esk feel was sooo good. Love what you and the team have done. Yall are amazing, keep it up
I legitimately felt so bad for Harry within that first hour; as a person who has multiple struggling alcoholics in his family, trying to quit drinking and then being forced to do a challenge where you have to potentially drink again has to be an awful feeling, man.
the ssx jerk it out track playing when they were going down from the top of the peak was immaculate nostalgia
Honestly BANGER
Really loved the vid i am loving what sidemen’s doing this year
kasper was the best
3 hours????? woah
Why would harry smell the sock lmaoooo
Casper is hilarious
The snow didn’t taste nice
KASPER NOT CASHPUR 🤣🤣 the subtitles cashpur made me crease
r.i.p the editors  banging vid tho
SWIVEL THE HIPS J
how has josh gone grey at 31?
need more of vik, simon & jj chemistry 😂😂
Ngl 3 hours video and I was expecting something different but nothing new it’s just 3 hours seing the same thing which is them moaning and skiing
I love vik's attitude. He is always such a good sport even though he is always on the bad team.
It took me since the moment it go posted till now to finish it. It was really good though!! Keep it up boys🙌🏼
these videos are to insane now
Fat JJ is making a comeback
500,000th🥳🎉
How Vik got 0 votes and had to dress like Mr Blobby 💀😂
2:58:10 Vik is unintentionally hilarious 🤣🤣🤣
The stray at Milton Keynes from Tobi 😭😭 what did the concrete cows do to you 😂
is ksi fat again?
You should do one where they’re all the bad team
Finally finished this mammoth of a video, and it is an absolute masterpiece. Fair play Josh and all the camera crew.
2:55:48 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Justice for Vik!
I say it every time but I gotta say it again. The production, editing everything on this is just so amazing! I mean at this point as it should as they are pretty much an empire. But the people in the background filming and editing are truly talented people
Haven’t watched these lot for so long, Josh’s going grey, looks good tho. and what on earth has happened to Ethan’s hair.
2:08:29 Even though it’s not, this look like really bad CGI
1:17:34 KSI's National Disaster Alarm
Casper should be employed as jj’s care person lol especially when he’s water man 😂😂
genuinely felt bad for harry, vik and simon on this one
Justice for vik, put him on the nice team next time
Why they laughing at the guy wanting a picture? they have become brats imo
I LOVE YOU GUYS AHH
Can we please shout out the editor
wait whos casper and where did he show up first
The ending is priceless
One of the best Sidemen videos ever 🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What's the game they play in the jacuzzi with the numbers?
The last bit of the video of everyone laughing is so funny😂😂
Class
Vik always gets done bad bruv
great content
The last 30 mins are way too entertaining 😭
It would’ve been funny if when they swapped another for each team they also swapped teams to good and bad haha
Why are jj and tobi always on the same team
Why JJ being so rude to his fans 🤣
wholesome ending
Loved the way @Zerkaa was picking members from the bad team to vote based off of who was voted. The last person on the good team should have voted the last person standing on the bad team, would have been an interesting scenario. Imaging 1 on the bad team and 5 on the good team XD
One of the best Sidemen videos, a literal movie🔥
The ending made me laugh the most,  just genuine banter
What was blurred on the pool table?
10/10 I really loves and enjoyed the bad team at the end of the video alot, it was the best thing ive seen in a while and it really meant alot to watch.
You guys should not complain some people have not left the country 😂😂😂
DID HARRY SNIFF THE SOCK 😭
no Konstantin?
Y’all should pull a Mr. Beast and fly a fan out to join the bad team cuz I know even if I was on the bad team I’m going to act like Casper the whole time
LOVED THIS! What a treat getting a 3hr Sidemen Sunday
u;ijbuhbjkuhbihb
this was a good vid but why cant they come up with new ideas for vids instead of having the same vids on rotation, they could do a go sidemen enter a 5 a side tournament or a go karting vid
Vik’s attitude in this❤
This video was actually crazy good. Watched bits throughout the week and my was it worth every second!
Loving the music boys
olabunji olamanji got be dead 😂😂😂1:29:16
The way harry got peer pressured into drinking :( I feel your pain bro hahaha
I have been asking for a vik harry Simon group for so long and now
Harry sniffing that woman’s sock at 1:16:20 is crazy 😂
I'd rather be the bad team These nights they will talk about for years to come.
I loved this video so much!!!
THE EDITING IS AMAZING OH MY GOSH!!! big shoutout to 18:10
Please make more like this😭
One of the best sidemen Sundays
“On the bus? With normal people? I’m too rich?” … Who does ksi think he is honestly? Perfect example of how money can really change you. Never forget where you come from no matter what you have in the bank!
I really like Sidemen Sundays being around 3 hours long. It really makes this even more then a movie and puts the viewers beside the sidemen for a special experience. Please do more like this.
NOT KSIs greatest video
Simon's look at the camera when he took more selfies was so funny  🤣🤣
K.s.i. Lips in the hot tub 😂😂😅so funny
2:27:10 sidemen should do haunted house or anything huanted video
ofcourse jj is in the good team. and ofcourse in the beginning he is whinging when he is on the bad team. He makes fun of the people on the bad team. then whinging again when he was on the bad team himself.  HE CANT HAVE FUN WITH NO MONEY. JJ STOP CRYING
Why wouldn’t u make us walk the most rich thing I’ve heard 😭💀
Because the French have no fun in them what so ever.. always grumpy when seeing people having fun.. plus smell
I love how Vikk always brings energy no matter what team he’s on. Needs more love from the boys 🥺❤️
Not Harry sniffing the sock 😂😂😂
Ngl jj has changed since money he’s arrogant and ungrateful
Where can I buy Josh’s silver puffer
Go to 2:16:40 with no context if you haven’t watched the video 😂
I really wanna know how much they spent on music licensing for this video
Jj went from fitneek to fatneek , even faster the. His downfall mann
Hands down one of the best!!!!!
Nahh jj has actually got a rich guy laugh now 1:28:13
Anyone going to mention Harry smelling the sock 😂
Ksi sitting in a sauna for 5 mins thinking that it’s gunna make him lose weight
1:26:00 😭
Ethan's face min 12:43
Micro aggression 😭😭 52:21
Yo 3h are crazyyy
Me watching the sidemen suddenly my mom mom walks In and jj and eathan screaming....! My mom goes wtf are you even watching .... I go its just a YouTube video never have felt this embarrassed ever thank you guys 😂🥰❤️
i love how late 20 yrs turn into the average boy gigling on the sleepover
3:00:02  so i never knew vikstar and josh's surnames until now. Damn🤯😂
I love it how no matter the amount of times Vik is on the bad team He always makes the most of it and has fun. Truly a kind soul, cant dislike him ❤
Josh was like I am about to, get railed  33:42
The callux violation at the end was top tier😂
Brilliant video
Goddamn 3 hours
Movieee
sidemen i know this isn't really your style of video but you gotta get sam and colby to take you out on a ghost hunt. It would be a banger idea please i beg🙏🙏🙏
Did they get licensing for music? Makes a real difference
Harry getting stressed with Josh while watching the skiing video was unreal 😂
hi harry
sidemen are the best
Something is so distasteful about jj saying “normal people”
Next time we should have both teams be on either a food vacation or a bad one. And half way through change it
I haven’t watched the video yet but I’m hoping the thumbnail didn’t spoil it. Also pray to god be loves you all
2:16:45 I was not expecting that at all 😂😂😂
Dude the mountain shot absolutely phenomenal a sight to be hold good work zerka 🎉❤
Video longer a god damn movie
Not bad team still hyping up Josh even though they hated Josh like 10 mins ago 😂 1:13:48
Caution: Dope 3 hour video with ads every 6 minutes.
Harry looks exactly like a titan from AOT at 2:16:43
تقليد فالكونز
what an absolute banger for the intro music
14:06 has me dead 💀
vikk getting no votes is actually crazy. Skiing was his thing man.
ksi is a very rude individual a fan asked for a photo and he laughed and insulted him
This video felt like a movie loved it ❤
our fat neek is returning
Everyone did vik dirty after he does so much . Bhez flexing on the prada board which vikk gave him 😂 should've chose him for the good team , he never gets it
After drunky knuckled Simon their security went to step in 😭🤣
i never get why they call people europeans when they are europeans
Sidemen hav out done themselves with this one! the montage of glacier 3000 + paradise was incredible.
why is randolf in these videos. Dude is straight up the most unfunny and annoying person I've seen
3 hours is wild
Anyone know where the good team were staying? It looks absolutely stunning
no chance in hell that that cost 200 bucks lmao
Harry insulting Denmark is mean.  MEN DANMARK BLEV NÆVNT I MEDIERNE!!!🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰
Bruv this is longer then Interstellar 😂😂
1:51:32, why is keith unlucky @miniminter
JJ making another video tough to watch
Easily one of the most entertaining sidemen video
1:34:08 Vik looking cold in this frame ❄️❄️❄️.
The Stars aligned and the 3 Nigerians are together again 🔥✊🏾
2:59:40 i could imagine myself livin here
The sleeping part was to funny
Harry smelling that strangers sock is wild
you must tease gravity had me dead
My strategy has always been to invest half of my income in the stock market every new month, the second part of my strategy is not to sell for at least 5 years, but recently my portfolio has suffered major decline about $150k in losses. Should I rather invest in crypto this time?
I feel bad for the boy who asked for a picture😂😂
Why is it winter holiday when it isn’t winter time
Why is it winter holiday when it isn’t winter time
Why is it winter holiday when it isn’t winter time
What a good video
best sidemen sunday ever
Every Sidemen Sunday and especially the holiday videos I get to a point where I check the time passed of the video in frustration that it’s almost over. Check on this one after a while and saw 2 hours left! Amazing job by everyone involved in this video. Amazing stuff and quality + quantity this time!
Goated video
3hrs is outrageous, man don't got time for all of that
Can they please do one where both teams are on the cheap team??
the editinggggg
bro created a masterpiece and thought we wouldn't notice it
Just finished it after  3 days woooooo
Josh going in with the bad team was such a good idea by him to lift up the vibes.
1:18:25
their cheap team is like my normal holiday
1:16:16 bro gave the sock a cheeky sniff
Lmao 2:51:15 great editing .. where the rest of that hot tub 😅😂
JJ adds so much more entertainment value to these videos
2:21:55
Tobi looking like krillz dressed in all that yellow
They should make one with both teams being a good or bad team but in different places
Ethan’s micro aggression throughout the video 🙁
1:16:20 nah man he smelled it.
Let the camera man in the video
Justice for Vik ☹️
What happen to Simon ?
W video, best video in a while.
if vik is not in good team in next video im unsubscribing
Vikstars mini meltdown and venting got me @2:2:54 😭😭😂😂❤️
Nah the way they did the robbery prank was soo dead didn’t even try and come in the house and scare them thinking it’s a real robbery but they just kicked the roof
When they switched that was f up
Ethan embraceing his black heritage by becoming an Albino.
1:16:20 Harry sniffing the sock is so hilarious
No one is talking about harry sniffing a worn womans sock?😂
JJ definitely been watching Friday night dinner
Nahhh Viks fit is fire tho
Love that tune they used and the drone zoom out at the end it worked out so well and Jj saying he loves them and goes for group hug is so wholesome
Ending was amazing thet but when black screen and subtitles of them joking was so funny I couldn’t stop laughing
2:16:41
how the f Vik can not control his legs to kick a ball but he can ski
38:17 Tobi’s face 😂😂😭
1:14:48
Is Toby wearing a whoop?
chelsea willie is crazy😂
Expensive team's outfits were very drippy 😍😍🤑
Bro when the screen was black and it was just audio is so hilarious because the boys can never stop laughing if even one of us still has any energy
You should do a holiday video with beta squad
1:16:49 best rock paper scissors moment haha 😀
zerka feels bad and came back to his fris❤
Harry is the last guy to deserve that promotion
We all skipping past Harry sniffing her sock
When harry was trading cheese the guy tried to give harry 2 packs of cigarettes 😂😂
1:52:13 😂
1:51:18 yeah vicky
Josh is actually the goat
1:16:18 harry sniffed the socks lol
1:49:10
55:37 why would Vik say this, let JJ enjoy his mostly in a bad team, let the man enjoy his
Vicky..😂
First time seeing Vikk carry a video and a 3-hour one at that. Legend.
Where were they?
5.30 I'm to rich for this 😅
JJ shouldn’t be allowed in public 😂
Love the fact the troops went to the bad team instead of the usual with the good team, they really needed that mood boost!
Tobi is too boring to b in the bad team he would just give yp
5:33 Jj pissed off 😂😂
Enjoyed last 10 mins more than the whole video 3:00:19
This video is longer than The Sidemen Story
insane how big the sidemen are now
the end of the video is the best part sorry
36:30 my heart dropped, then i realised it wasn't a red dot. woulda been RIP Miniminter
2:16:47 WTF IS HARRY DOING 😂😂😂😂😂😂
1:10:21🤣🤣
that last 5 minutes with all boys. Just priceless.
#removezerkaa
Can you just give them all a good vacation for once
randy cam is like blair witch 😭
1:16:19 did bro just sniff the socks 💀
Ethan and harry dancing whilst vik jj and simon are being robbed is amazing 💀
51:45 I wonder who lost it and went to the bad team 💀
Let me land on Jesus 😂😂
Like my comment instead of getting the video to 500k likes
I feel bad for vik
ALWAYS VIK HARRY IN THE BAD TEAM🥲
Sidemen build a camper on a budget and then have to camp in it! 🎉
Taken me three days to watch all this
3:00:30 arguably best ending in a sidemen video
Does KSI think he’s funny? He’s kinda annoying and ruins the video tbh (still watched the whole thing and it’s great)
What's with the copyrighted music all of a sudden?😂
39:56 "30 btw" 😂😂
1:47:50 didn’t even question it, just silently face in 😂
1:16:18 harry sniffing the sock is crazy
Holyyyy the end was actually the funniest thing I've seen in a sidemen video in a while 💀💀💀
cashper (casper) honestly made me audibly laugh so many times  🤣 he need to be in more videos 👌
27:47 Tobi falling over was way funnier that it needed to
Vik's postivity >>>
JJ going down the zipline might've been the most grotesque shot of the video lmfao
But why did Harry smell the fkn sock 😭😭😭
Where is Kon?😭😭😭😭😭
Are we just going to ignore Harry sniffing the sock?
1:00:42 this has to be one of my favourite camera angles 😂
Absolute class this one is
This is one of the best videos yet
Like a movie<3
Honestly this has been one of the best things ive ever watched, genuinely made me shed a tear, will be rewatching this Sidemen Sunday alotttt for yearsss
Felt a bit bad when they kept saying about the mpc
Cashpur is too funny. The way he wouldn't let JJ rest but also took care of him was great. Dan is a genius.
Almost 500k likes
Harry smelling the sock @ 1:16:20😂😂😂
Please tell me that sidemen airlines intro isn't a proof of concept and that your next venture isn't flights. 😂
do one where all of them are on the good team but they don't know til they get there
“Alright on we go” same vik same …..
24:31 thought he bout to start helicoptering
😂😂😂 TIME UP.
they makin movies
JJS HAND WHEN HES on THE ZIPLINE poor thing Josh sking the most beautiful slope ever that’s messed up😂😂😂😂😂
Best Sidemen video in a long long time
Anyone else catch Kasper calling JJ va j j. 😂
something i dont understand is why did josh ask ONLY jj who would he remove from the good team but the rest a different question ?
Josh really just dropped a whole movie
Calfreezy cameo at 2:16:43
Holy mother, 3 hours…
JJ's fat again yay
1:16:18 , harry smelling the sock😭
1:16:19 harry is smelling the sock that he traded the cheese wheel for LMAO
That sidemen sleepover the first night in the hostel has such old sidemen vibes
8:49 "we are not on the bad team we're on the cheap team"!  i love tobi's positive vibes!
Anyone know the name of the song at 2:04:28?
2:14:06
Wow
Ngl I don’t know if this is a new editor but whoever did it was class
Vik didn't even get a single vote...feels bad for him
Bro sniffed the sock 💀
yeahhhh!!!!
that ski instructor working overtime for jj
Btw guys cashper has a YT channel named “ Cashpur Longshlong (played by actor Dan Dewhrist) “
1:47:49 Why was that so funny 🤣
The way harry smelled the sock is hillarious
waste f time
vik is such a moany karen
Vik is a vibe
only harry would nonchalantly take a sniff of the sock 1:16:20
I didnt even realise that the video was 3 hours long till after 😂
3 hours guys ??? Mhhhh it’ll take me three days
fatneek is making a return 1:07:45
I might be wrong, but tbh the bad team IMO was having some really good stuff as well. Camping and stuff, that could have been made a bit more enjoyable if only other two would also have been like Vik.
Just realized Kon isn't listed in the camera operators. 3:00:10
Harry Sniffing that woman sock was crazy 1:16:20
anyone else begging for phil when they said world class instructor?
JESUS IS KING!
At times vik looks so hot man
Bad team complaining about their outfits night one…am I the only one who finds them sick?!😅
It's actually so funny that both teams end up playing the same game the 2nd night
U lot are the best man. Thank u so much
Harry’s bridge run was amazing
can just josh, ethan and harry be a team more often, they are THE BOYS
2:13:00 The transition from a stunning landscape to JJ on the floor has me dead 😂
This was absolute peak Sidemen content right there, wish we had an extra day 😂
WHEN ETHAN TOOK OF THE GOGGLES , HES A MEATY PERSON  LOOL POOR FAITH
god I love vik’s positivity on the bad team it always creates a great dynamic, BUT please let this man be on the good team.
KASPAAAAAA
Them all laughing in bed is so wholesome
Man I’m 9 minutes in and all I’m thinking is… why is KSI being so damn rude? Just being blatantly mean to random people/fans for no reason
JJs lack of adventure is parasitic
VIK harry and tobi will be the best winning trio!
JOSH COOKEDDDDD
18:11why am is repeatedly watching this cinematics
Zerka is a real friend, saw his friends struggling and went to them to support them😊😊
Idk much about skiiing but vik looks smooth with it
what an absolute bangerk for the intro musick
Nah Vikk is an absolute legend! Man has not been on the good team for eons & still has the best attitude.
how can 3 hours end so fast wtf
this video made me look up what micro-aggression means lol
OI NAH IS NO ONE GONNA MENTION THE TRANSITION TO HARRY RUNNING ACROSS THAT BRIDGE 😂😂😂 OMFG! 😂😂
Casper is the goat
Hey guys it’s me vikkstar 23
I love how passive aggressive Ethan is for the entire video 😂
1:16:18 he sniffed the sock 😂
1:11:11 Simon played it soo good what a clip
COLLAB WITH STORROR!!!
1:25:54 the joke had me 😂😂
What a movie ! Very well done :]
I’m so glad that Simon is on the bad team, that’s what he gets after saying that he loves being on the bad team in a previous video 😂.
KSI is the LEAST athletic person I know
The 3 Nigerian’s back on a team together again at last
Anyone realize it was a 3 hour video 😮 the boys are moving mad
So are we gonna act like Harry didn't just take a whiff of that sock
Top video.. production felt allot like the grand tour!
I loved how happy vik was to see the boys. “Now it’s a party!” Really made the difference for everyone else. I had to watch this video within 4 days and I loved every second of it 💯
Incredible video 🎉
I’ve watched this 5 times all the way through. Best vid in a while!
1:54:46 ksi ready to bring boxing to the slopes 😂
no way bro actually starting to get gray hair its over for josh
damn i wanted to see harry and tobi together lol
They do kinda leave vik out
This video was just big babies crying and wining
SO GOOD!!!
That was a good video
What a video that was! Ending was so good.
did no one see harry smelling the sock
Noah got robbed
42:01 that is the fattest reaction to some cheese dipped food
2:58:02 is the funniest thing ever
I feel so bad for vik none of them give AF about him 😂
8 hour shift, and I get to spend 3 of it on a banger vid from the boyz
Underrated opinion they should do a monthly 3 hour episode like these but called travelling with the sidemen and go in 2 dinged up caravans
its impossible for jj to be on the bad team (cause hed throw a fit if he was). notice how every time hes been on the "bad team" its been bangin and expensive
2:58:07 had me in TEARS!!!😂😂
ethan @14:05 😂😂😂😂
In the next sidemen Sunday, why not be fare to all the sidemen so they all can enjoy together
the ending was priceless, when the troops was having a sleep over making good memories. makes me think of all the good times.
1:35:35 I genuinely feel bad for Vik at this moment 😭
used to love simon but bruh is so dead
That harry camera angle 2:16:41 though
https://youtube.com/shorts/6LOsH4hr9ew?feature=shared
1:16:48 vik finally gets his karma for stealing from ethan
i usually watch sidemen videos while on my breaks and lunches at work, every week. and this lasted me all the way to wednesday, still not done, just wanted to say what a banger of a video and i love casper😂
Vik thinking he’s good at skiing is hard to watch
JJ's hair looks SO good like that
Ethan and jj are a vibe love them 👍
is no one going to talk about the crazy production of this video??
vik carried so hard.. damn
Everything is a “micro aggression” to KSI😂😂😂😂😂
Bru after seeing this video I want Moon Boots bad 😩😭
The NPC bit has me so dead
This is a serious contender for top 3 sidemen Sundays ever
WHAT A BANGER
The ending of the bad team boys laughing was so funny
i would kill to be on a free ski trip
Possibly the best Sidemen video ever
I absolutely love how Josh chose to hang out with the cheap team to make them feel better
The rock climbing jj face cam lmao. Needed the 360 one
Ended like a fukin movie 😄
Who’s gonna watch 3 hours long vid
Ethan and JJ got it this episode
Harry running across the bridge with the camera in his mouth KILLED me
2:16:40 Harry running through a mountain of snow with his nose, standard.
Having that instructor was boring it just destroyed the vibe
Nahhhh Harry @  1:16:20 😭😭😭😭😭
Whoever did the cut from the peak of the mountain and Paradise playing, to JJ failing at skiing is such a jokester 😂😂
2:16:40  Harry 😂..
This video was way too long and not that good. How does it have so many views?
That snoring was simon for sure that voice sound like simon
Can’t lie this was a great video and the ending was wholesome asf
1:14:51
I can honestly say, well done boys! It will be definitely one of the best videos this year and in my opinion one of the best ever! Great content, production, editing, music, sfx. World class! Cheers from Warsaw, Poland! 😎
Scene: CINEMATIC! Roleplay: REAL!! Vikstar: LEGEND!!!
Amazing video sidefellas
Njjhhg
Casper should come on every “bad” holiday
More videos with Casper please!!!
a literal movie 👏🏻
38:20 jj so funny hahahhaha, WHAT A BANGER!
harry smelling sock
Love the credits at the end
3 hours is crazy
Since Vik keeps getting on the bad team, he should get one video where he's automatically on the good team and he gets to choose who goes with him
It took me 3 days but this video was fun to watch
Why Dose JJ always seem so incompetent
Genuinely all recent sidemen travel video titles can just be changed to “6 Millionaire 30 year olds take turns at complaining about going on holidays that average people would love to go on”
This was honestly one of the best sidemen vids ever ❤️💙💛🧡💜🩷
The amount of ads on this video is insane
Vik is always committed to the content he’s been on too many bad teams
Since when josh last name is bradly and not zerker ?
The number of times JJ has said ‘I wanna die’ during these challenges😂
The people that did the shots were 15. good luck guys
Cashper whooo best side men
Ksi is such a baby bruh
2:16:40 i was not ready for that💀
that ending was gold. What a W video/movie
What happened to JJ the fat neek has returned
3hr video 😲
didnt expect fatboy slim at the start
It's so adorable that both teams still played wavelength. They've clearly done this too many times!
1:16:19 why did harry smell her sock 😭😭
Viks the goat 🐐📈
I just bearly realized after n hour in this is 3 hours long  lmao
We 100% need credits after every sidemen holiday video now.
I'm gonna be honest, Vik Carried the bad team through the whole trip, MVP.
Do a cozy vs luxury
The last 5 mins had me crying real tears that’s real content right there
Song name 27:35 -27:56
i hope jj was less rude off camera lol
Naahh the ending was just the best parts imo 😂😂
This is the most random sidemen Sunday I’ve ever seen and I love it
when Kasper said “Come on shlowmo” i lost it😂
Even though it isn’t surprising… it’s sad how insufferable JJ has gotten
14:04 😂 Ethan: bye migros -jj: 😮😗
The serotonin that Tobi’s Elmo laugh gives me is so real
The cut to harry on the bridge 🤣🤣🤣
Couldn’t even see half of this. Who has even 3 spare hours in a day
the outfits bang
Where is simon during ski
whichever camera man(maybe james) kept doing them still wide shots of the bad team at the first half was so cinematic really added to the movie vibes
5 minutes of Randy standup is peak bad team experience
Why is tobi always in the good team?
jj was so mean to the guy that asked for a picture a was dying for 10 minitus man jj to much
All the boys laughing at the end was golden sidemen content
feeling kinda sad for vick imagine being toether as friend for more than decade and still getting no vote,and not to forget he always get the bad team and still able to keep calm. now i kinda  feel he should  move on from sidemen as he deserve better
Ksi is kind of a jerk to everyone in this video.
jj eating represents me sooo much
its sad seeing  nobody voting for vik i feel so bad for him , even the last video they mocked the fact that jj had the worst person "vik" i think its time for him to leave this toxic friendship
I think it's time for the BBC to throw them a Top Gear-sized bag!
1:16:19 bro had to check the smell
1:10:29
I love the holiday videos 🤣but I do wish JJ was on the bad team sometimes 🤣man is always on the good team haha
That transition at 2:16:40 is nuts 😂😂
As someone who's obsessed with Switzerland, this video a 10/10
Cashpur was the real star😂
No monkey business 😂😂😅
I didn’t realize this was a three hour video until halfway through
Ngl KSI was mad annoying this video. I know it’s all jokes but I damn near had to skip the whole ski-ing part
Imagine being on the Adventure tour bus looking forward to your ski holiday and suddenly KSI steps in there and screams his head off going "get me out of here man, I am too rich for this". 🤣 12:35 nah cmon man that was a bit odd ...
“Are there normal people on this bus” yikes…
Why did Harry close up to the camera on the bridge look like Cal Freezy 😂😂
KSI needs to be poor for a bit…
i just finished this, with three different sit ins watching it over 3 days
I could do it better than eathan and Toby get me der if I could a better Time I get a prize
Yo
The autistic breakdown harry had at 1:51:46 was so funny. Id deffo react the same though
casper needs his own show - lets get the bad team to live with casper for 2 days
banger 🐐
Like for Vik on the good team 🙌🏻
1:08:26 so this why ksi ain’t boxing nomo 🤣🤣
I will always love seeing Simon on the bad team and will always love seeing jj on the bad team 😂😂
Jj zip lining 😂😂😂
1:16:20 why does Harry smell the sock??😂😂
Casper was awesome 😂
Nice video. I love the end bloopers. Picture of mei😂
Bro sidemen stepped it up man damn
Big up to the editor👏🏾
Big up to the editor👏🏾
icl jj kinda annoying these days bro just straight complaining n calling ppl npcs like a tate fanboy
The editing on this goes CRAZY, big up to the team! 🔥
bro vik got no votes but hes been on the good time the least times :(
2:12:51 bangers upon bangers❤
vik is always and will always be the nicest sidemen member lmao     HARRY DID NOT JUST SMELL THAT SOCK
2:16:40 wtf is that angle 😂
Are we going to ignore how harry literally sniffed some random woman’s sock 😂
pettition for cheap vs expensive vs josh here
feel bad for vik
it’s getting to the point now where I think Josh just really dislikes Vik 😔
1:26:02 is mental XD
Vikk gets stiffed every time while Tobi gets niced...
Harry took that sock home 😂
vik is the sweetest person  I don’t like the way they treat him.  And he deserves to be on the good team!!!
8:58 they wrong for this😭😭😭
1:08:18 I feel like I've seen that pool before in a movie or something...
Why is this vid so long !
Why is vik always on the bad team I don’t like this😭
I BEG.. If they ever do a fans good team vs bad team type thing sign me the f up! I honestly wouldn’t gaf what the challenges were😂 once in a lifetime kinda trips
y'all brought on Randolph and the Callums a little too late 😂😂😂
The drone shots of the bridge on the mountain with Coldplay in the background is nice
harry running on  the bridge reminds me of the titans running
That ending😂😂😂
Obv on purpose, but they JJ so dirty with those forehead camera angles 😅
By far the longest YouTube video I’ve ever watched but also one of the most entertaining
romanian flag at 1:28:10
2:16:40 Bruhhhhhh harry with the funky run got me 🤣
Naah JJ is fatneek again
2:10:40 Thank me later
1:16:19 Harry casually sniffing the sock
37:06 vik 😂
I been there I have a place out there
JJ mocking the bad team and getting Karma was funny  and adding salt to the wound….the same guy he had in his video is telling him to pull it together
This is literally like a movie
The end of the video is so nice and funny
Anyone see the laser someone pointed on simans head?
them two in the hot tub with the camera underwater had me dying
2:16:39 harrry 😂😂😂
As beautiful as the shots at 2:12:30 were, I know that weather broke josh's and the crew's hearts.
Took me 2 days to complete watching it but it was worth it!
Jj is such a spoiled lil winey disrespectful baby
After jj swapped, I just skip the good team .
2:11:16 suomi mainittu torilla tavataan!
Can we for once give both teams a suprise and let them both be the good team?
I like your vids but I aint spending 3 hours watching this, I would rather watch your old football vids for three hours...
honestly is getting sus how tobi seems to only get the good team.. also ethan need to be on the bad team its been a long while
In the summer I wanna see the sidemen go to hawaii and surf!!
Top gears vibes 🫡🔥🔥
Zeerka visit India
Why did harry smell the sock😂😂😂
1:00:00 y’all did jj dirty with that camera angle 😂😂😂
2:04:30 is such a vibe
2:50:16 Simon struggling to switch gears
2:30:46 best moment four 2s
Wish vik get on the good team feel bad for him
I’ll watch this over the weekend during my Minnesota snow storm
The instructor cut scene was so fire so cinematic 🔥🔥🔥
This was the only 3 hour video that i have ever watched to start to end like i can't even watch 3 hour movies
JJ loves to complain
i feel like josh has always purposely picked vik for bad team because hes never actually in any good team????
2:16:34 Steve 🤣🤣
Vikk is a true gentleman he hasn’t been on a good team still he has the best attitude
Am I the only one that felt bad for Vic??!! Poor guy!😂
does anyone know where the losing team went skiing?
Took me 3 days to finish but unreal content 😂😂
cheap team is always best
this is the best sidemen video ❤
Fat ksi is back in town🤣🤣
The smile that came over my face when "Jerk it out" came on while they were boarding. Took me back to simpler times playing SSX3 on a Saturday morning.
Bad team night out was a big let down
WE NEED FOLABIIII BACK
I didnt expect this video  to be so wholesome by the end, i genuinely enjoyed the bad team part more
this was the best holidy video so far  <3
this is the best sidemen video i've seen in a while big up josh
Josh u my guy But tell me one thing How would the bad team would have worked with JJ and Tobi when most tasks are bar related
Jj out of camp is scarily wide
their editing is crazy
Why vik is always on bad team  I will love to see vik on good team...
Ethan def watching how I met your mother right now
KSI AS HOST
the best part of the video is the last 30:00 mins
The "Paradise" moment 💫
thought the guy who had the mic on the bus was jurgen klop
greatest youtube video of all time
Honestly keep this length of videos it’s fantastic
Nahhh they did Vik so wrong. Let our boy be on the good team!!!!!!
18:13 😮
The part jj got voted out was funny as fffff
ik son didnt just smell the sock
Promoting Coca Cola😒?
That is insane
This video is how long?
fatneek is back😀😀
the best in the best
Bro we can all relate to that last 3 minutes of the video, thats every sleep over when the lights turn off hahaha. Gold
Best sidemen video of 2024
harry running across the bridge like a titan had me dyyyying
1:08:19 reminds me of the hide and seek video where jj almost went into the pool to get Ethan sitting on the swing😂. Now they actually in the pool swinging together😂
the quality of the intro of this video was amazing.
solid music choices
Harry: “Give em a kiss goodnight then Vik go on”   *Vik gives kiss*   Harry: ohh that’s a bit weird  1:24:49
vik not getting one vote broke my heart
Harry* "Give the camera a kiss goodnight" Vik* *kisses camera* Harry* "Well that was a bit weird"🤣🤣
Why did Harry smell the sock 😂.
Bruh -20? It was -45 here where I live a few weeks ago.
2:16:39 that titan pov came out of nowhere i nearly spilled the tea 🚶
The tommy fight turned KSI fat again
Josh so goated man
Tbh could've shaved off at least 30 mins of this 😂
That ending is so perfect because i remember hitting 18 and graduating and my friend group was hosting a sleepover halo party etc for our lads new place and it was such a blast was one of the last big sleep overs i can remember.
I love how @TBJZL is like a big brother to @jjolatunji 🤣🤣 that jacket scene had me rolling
The guy they gave a shot too and played rock paper scissors with was a wholesome moment
1:16:17 harry smelled it like a champ hahahah
tobi gotta be on the bad team and vik the good one next time without a doubt
34:34 HE FED THAT SHEEESH VIKK “Odd of ten, *aieight*. 3,2,1 eight”  Okay magician okayyy
1:14:40 bro has lost it
The Danes will remember this Harry😈
26:07 is that a dwag 😂😂🤣🤣
Greatest. Sidemen. Sunday. Ever.
This YouTube video gave us more depth the Barbie, more chaos than Oppenheimer and the most instrumental play of emotions a man can ask for. I’d pay to see something like this in cinemas. The sleepover at the end made me miss them so much when I was younger.
Damn bruh I wish I had friends
Jj being spoilt and then ending on the cheap team 😂
This really is an incredible sidemen Sunday !
Sidemen drunk sleepover video!!!
We need a $20000 vs $200 where the fans have some control over what happens n all the boys are involved👀
There's really no use putting jj on the bad team He just makes it unwatchable and nobody knows how to make the good team fun like he does
Geneva mention 🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭🇨🇭
I’ve had to come back to this vid like 5 different times now to carry on watching. GG Boys
1:17:36 that's WW2 Siren!! 😳
Guys pls come to India for a video shoot come to kolkata plsss
vik not getting a vote 😢
JJ reaction to ethan on his team 🤣
Jj is such a moaning kill joy. To me even the bad team was elite. Ps big big respects to vik.
Kaspar made the skiing part so much better
ski instructor well annoying YA
This is the best production of all time for a youtube video imo
nice video! a bit boring that the picture on the vid spoils the team thoo :(
End credits is chef’s kiss
Absolutely loved it. Ksi being dead inside while getting manhandled by Kasper was peak. Kasper smashed it lol
I just finished this and wow… masterpiece. This really was epic and big up to josh for putting this together.
josh deserves so much credittt!!!!! man is hella underrated
W video. Best. this year. Well done Josh. Vikk deserves a good team
1:03:36 Tobi absolutely destroyed both of them!
32:00 watch for 20 seconds JJ is JOKESSSS 🤣🤣🤣
This was a video for the ages. It's crazy the work that goes into these. Big ups to the boys for making another banger
*Anything happens*  Tobi: I knew it.
so cool
vik getting no votes is criminal give that man a break.....
Vik is fr the GOAT!
🌊❄️⛰️🗺️🗿🗽

If jj really tries he can have fun but he just throwing a tantrum hahaha
More kasper in the future plz
No way Harry sniffed the sock lmaoo
shoutout to the editer wauww
The ending credits with the drone + music gave me the same funny feeling a happy ending in a good movie does. Incredible work
Artistic swimming was the best part in this video haha
That SleepOver Reminded me the time When me and my Friends use to sleepover....🥲
Thanks @Zerkaa for hosting this masterpiece ❤
god I love vik’s positivity on the bad team it always creates a great dynamic, BUT please let this man be on the good team.
2:12:35 just leaving this here for me to return too coz this has got to be one of the best things I’ve ever seen
3 hour vid! Love it! Spending my me time watching this!
I would accept josh as a sugar daddy😂😂😂
Loved this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
those ski suits are so cool i wish i had one
The slow mo walk was cold
2:14 a titan has been detected
3 hours is crazy 😅
Has something happened to Kon, how come we haven’t seen him around much lately?
Honestly, the bad team looks real fun
This is as long as endgame
Okay but can we talk about the cinematic shots combined with the songs 🔥
Bro this isn’t even a video atp, it’s a movie😂
How is no one talking about harry smelling the sock 1:16:15 😭😭😭
2:35:30  jj
The ski instructor had to lift 100kg of jj for way to many times for his own good hahhaha
2:31:02 the optimsm
They have gone above and beyond again never expected to see a 3hr sidemen Sunday big up the boy's
47:00 no, no it is not, 0,0 dollars across all accounts, cant get a job, depressed out of my mind while friends lives are progressing
The bad teams spirit at the end was wow❤❤❤❤
man those don't feel like holidays. they feel like so much hard work :( i feel bad for the boys and the crew.
3 hour?!!??! CRAZYYYYY!
This was a movieeee
im starting to think these man babies believe there own titles. crying about the bad team when ur trip still cost $3000
Damn ksi is fat again
come on boyy😂
Bangerrrrrrrrdr
I mean...who doesnt love josh❤
Fa fa vuu
nah yall gotta give the red suit to Toby bruh he to fresh to let white boy Kyle wear it (ethan)
is jj eating mcdonald’s ever after the palestine thing on live? is he serious
Don’t this mfers know they’re European too? Wtf is this 🤣
2:30:00 to 2:50:00 we get to see the parts of sidemen content that normally get cut from the published videos
The fact that they enjoying life listening to jj's song while his have the worst time is just so sad
This was amazing. The production was like a movie. Also the part of them just messing around at the sleepover was gold
Harry at 2:16:43 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Air crash investigation is 🐐
the girl at 1:15:03 is peng
best sidemen sunday of all time
Best ending to a video they've ever had
❤❤❤
Those sleep over vibes at the end was so wholesome. Also Vikk being an NPC at the end had me dying.
love these long form videos!!!
The mix of luxury and chaos in this adventure is why I love Sidemen videos so much! 😂🎿
The cut at 2:16:39 has me absolutely DYING!!
Unbelievable video!!! Smashed out the park once again! No one on any platform does it better.
14:05 Ethan knows what he is doing
I watched the whole thing and this couldve been 2hours shorter and I wouldve been even happier. Still a banger tho
For a boxer, jj seems lazy or unfit or both
Nahh man vik deserves better. Nobody voted for him and still he was so optimistic till the end of the vid. He is underated af. HOPEFULLY he gets the good team next time.
One more certified zerkaa banger f9r the list
What a dub josh 👊🔥 Vik deserves a luxury team tho
It's so weird seeing the boys at Glacier 3000, it's 35mins from my home and I ski there very often!
“ i’m too rich for this”only thing JJ says
Glad u can afford holiday unlike some have good time lads
If I could get the 'bad team' holiday for $200 I would retire now and live my life like this everyday
sidemen are finally back
MASTERPIECE
2:58:05 favourite moment
2:16:32 😂 the transition from kissing simons hand to the pov of harry running across the bridge. I cant 😂
Does the Side+ version have Harry and Tobi bang the chicks in the pool?
The cheap team ending was my favorite part. The vibes at the end from being deflated to the troops coming through  and every one cracking up laughing was wholesome.
we really need a full sidemen holiday or road trip video but it should only be them with their go pros, no camera men, no staff, no professional camera scenes and footage, it wont look the most aesthetically pleasing but it will most definitely be the mos raw and natural one without the possible awkwardness of a full camera crew following them at every corner
😀 my grandparents are from the nederlands
When JJ and Ethan were playing 'Football Willies' they definitely missed a 'Frankie Je Dong' joke.
Best video of sidemen sunday !!!!nah Josh is the great host bro🔥
Woo!
The sidemen should make a cheap vs. expensive in which the expensive team is just a bunch or rip off overpriced attractions, and the cheap team is genuinely more enjoyable
Petition for Vikk to be in the good team next time. 😢 #GenuinelySadForHim
Not y’all eating McDonald’s
nah that sleep over was amazing loved it
1:16:17 harry sniffed the sock i am dead
the concept of the video being a feature movie is a really interesting idea but i kinda liked it
simon was only on his phone the whole time
I thought jj and casper would have rode the zipline together tht would have been hilarious😁😁
Loser team moaning about a holiday millions of people cannot afford or even wish for
god I love vik’s positivity on the bad team it always creates a great dynamic, BUT please let this man be on the good team.
god I love vik’s positivity on the bad team it always creates a great dynamic, BUT please let this man be on the good team.
1:25:34 is that ed sheeran
That was a great sidemen video🫡
Harry literally took a sniff of that women 's sock 🤣🤣☠️
58:52 Josh just going past the window 😂
2:58:10 vikstar just says something random and everyone bursts up 🤣🤣
Honestly the best intro ever 🤣.   I got goosebumps down my spine . W's in da schatt
Jj needs to just try and actually enjoy
Is this the only sidemen sunday to use copyrighted music?
Anyone know where or how far away the wooden shack was they had to hike to? Quite a trek…
New Zealand edition when?
Damn, feel bad now. I can't stand Vik but everyone is hyping him up. Am I missing something?
Proud of Ethan for killing that obstacle course, boys come a long way
This vid was incredible. 3 hours of sidemen. a whole movie. Love yall fr
1:16:19  nah harry is smelling the sock 😭🙏💀
vik is really kind
Vik is my fave sidemen member because he’s just positive at Any given moment, been on the bad team over and over again yet always has good energy he deserves to be on the best team next
JJ is comes across so arrogant. Bit of money and its gone to his head.
Ksi calling people npcs straight to their faces 😂
Simon was like yeahh I'm sticking on JJ absolutely without any 2nd questions 😂😂😂
Ethan's laugh sounds exactly like Minecraft character eating 😂😂😂
This has to be one of the best videos in sidemen history for sure
these guys treat vik like sh1t lmao, them boys needa grow up
Production quality is INSANE
3hrs is too long....really enjoyed upto 2hrs, but then just skipped through the last hour
That angle of just on the zip line is the worst I’ve ever seen haha
I enjoy seeing harry on the bad team. His reactions are hilarious.
We need to see JJ on the absolutely worst to date bad team ever invented..... Please josh. Something absolutely despicably horrible
Josh with the w videos again
I’m a bit bummed that they didn’t do the drinking challenges. Some of the best sidemen videos are wen they just get drunk and end up having a blast in random places
Y’all bully vik to much. Reel ya heads in
Yo the level of editing during the ad for the video was amazing especially the ad for the future sidemen video 🤩🤩🤩
Bro jj turning into fatneek again.....???????
People get mad at the sidemen calling fans NPCs but will happily call them all sorts of names in the comments 😂 it goes both ways, idiots.
10/10
3:00:07 favourite 2 shots
Is jj getting fat?
look at viks face
Jj and Simon saying Vik should get the bed is peak 😂
Aint no way harry just took a sniff of that stranger’s sock 1:16:00
When did JJ get so fat again😭
If this is what we’re getting this year… we’re about to be spoiled 🤩
The ending had me dying when vik said something then jj called him an npc 😂😂😂 vik is the funniest most random person 😂😂
Sidemen dropped winter holidays in summer 😂
Is JJ doing it for the camera character or he is just such a snob. He is annoying already
My favourite cheap vs expensive video yet, loved the ending of them just goofing off before bed. Brings back old memories of school camping, oh the good times.
Why JJ SO NEGATIVE
1:16:19 why did harry smell the sock 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
1:17:40  KSI sounding like a WW2 siren
Legit one of the best videos
How does JJ manage to be both sorest loser and the sorest winner at the same time?
Cashper was great. Shame there was a 1min unskippable ad every 5 mins 😔
35:21 Okay Adorable 🥹KSI
1:16:20 Harry just sniffs the random ladies crusty sock fresh off her crusty foot.
Three hours is craaaazy!
The moment they didn't choose vikk for the good team halfway through, the video was ruined for me tbh
i can already see this video being the 2nd best sdmn sunday of all timee!!!! JOSH absolutely cooked everything.. the moments in this video with harry getting absolutely send trying to record whoever was snoring, the cheap teams whole bar hopping experience, cashpur teach the cheap team how to ski and the expensive team trying to ski and crossing that bridge.. the troops turning up to the cheap teams lodge and scarig them, having fun in the dark while waffling nonsense during their sleepover😍😍😍😍S TIER VIDEOO
Always funny how good team is like a once in a lifetime experience for most people and bad team is a regular persons vacation
Put vik on good tam or make him host
nahhh pity vik man. He's never been on the good team. He deserves better.
Casper was a GOAT
jj: "when we get in the ring" meanwhile couldn't even do monkey bars LMAOOOO
The credits went so hard
that aint casper that's zeke!
what a sick song for the intro i was bopping
harry sniffing the sock...
What happened ksi
43:07 .... is that a hair hanging off KSI's plate??
Best video by far
❤❤
Harry likes to sniff ukik 😂 1:16:19 🤣🤣
mic quality was a bit bad but sick video yall
I actually feel so bad for the bad team, I wish josh would do a little surprise one someday where after a lot of back and forth the boys all meet josh at the expensive holiday and they all have fun together as the sidemen we know and love
This has pretty much convinced me to get the knee surgery ive been terrified of 😅because now i miss the slopes so bad
how'd they get the rights to some of this music 😭
Josh is the best host period
can we talk on how Tobi ran through those monkey bars no struggle👀😭
bro harry sniffed the sock 😂
Bro such a missed chance to let the boys go to bed and have the troops actually commit like a fake robbery to scare the boys but obviously have the crew and Steve in on it. Woulda been gold
Ksi on the good team and still sooking. I honestly can’t stand him.
music selection for this entire video was amazing
After 1 hour it started like Cherdleys Trevor Wallace recording
Harry trying to not drink and  josh making him drink was a real bro move
vik shld js get a solo holiday vid w his partner and the rest in the bad team
I thought JJ was lactose intolerant
This a literal movie 🎥🔥
what an amazing video
josh is not allowed to host ever again make vikstar host lol randy 😅
Great video 🔥
Once the good team got back for the second night, I couldn’t care less about them. The poor team stole the video bc the troops showed up and that was definite vibes.
love the ski instructor made every min of theis vid that much better
honestly one of the best sidemen videos in a bit
I will give a homeless person a $10 for every like I get
Josh deserves his respect. He’s a genius
3 hours !!!!!! Wowwyyyy
ending credits scenes were so perfect, well done 🥶❄💙 !
This was more like a movie than a video. Best sidemen sunday we have had in awhile. Good job josh 👍
ok this was a dope video
what if they each went to a different location😆or 4 teams of 2
1:39:32 ....great edit ❤
Petition for Vik to be on the good team for once 👇
2:12:34 the only music that fits well to the beatiful scenery
Anyone else think the music/editing in this video was awesome?
Lets just ignore harry sniffing that sock😂😂😂😂
how come they can use licenced music now?
Posting this in the spring is crazy
imagine two bad teams and the guys not knowing until they call each other lmaoooo, this is a 10/10 vid
Sidemen video a giant sleep over with all the troops cuz that end was jokes
Loved the vid! And the editing with the music!
NAH put VIK is good team!! He deserves it!!
Zerka is the goat! Best video of all time
40:26 had me dying
1:39:32 whaaaaat an intro. Loved this video. So many parts I just keep wanting to go back to. 10/10 lads 10/10.
it mightve taken me 2.5 days to finish. but this was a masterpiece. and to think the bar couldn't be set any higher. wow
I watched ts for 3 hours ;-;
Vikk is by far the funniest and kindest, and is my favorite Sidemen. The way that Josh says so proudly that Vikk got zero votes and the way JJ and Simon laughing shows so much evil imo. They are literally 31 years old now and its time to start growing up in the way they behave.
3 HOUR VIDEO?!?! I'M HERE FOR IT
I've never seen Tobi so incapable at anything before, he always seems like he's at least decent at anything
how was that the ending?! that felt like such a cliff hanger!!
the team of vik,simon and harry had a lot more chemistry than the other team
Randolf is a massive L  Don’t put the loser in any future videos.
Waiting for a 3 hour reaction from Freyaa 😂
Not Harry smelling the sock 1:16:20
https://youtu.be/CokkIDEYkBc anotha bath leak from harry?!!!!!
the sponsorships in this vid are crazyyyyyy
loved the credits at the end and the cheap team literally won with the memories and the sleepover
Harry was definitely contemplating trading the cheese for a joint
This deserves so much more views I don’t often watch the holiday ones but this was an absolute masterpiece
need more of mozart or whatever his name is LOL
anyone else see the sock harry sniffed
why is no one talking about the sleepover 😂😭😭😭
this video is acc crazy! 3 hours long , editing , general style of video. this might be the best sideman video ever
simon takes all of the fun out of these videos....
the ending was so good loved this
oh wow this made
Bro JJ was so cringe
1:18:00 ain't no way jj and Ethan made my dad come into my room the check what was going on
Why does Simon keep disappearing 🤨
They should do good cheap holiday vs bad expensive one to show cheap holidays can be good
Literally like a movie, loved the stories and the little intro of Cashpa 😂 soo soo good!! Well done boys!! 🤘
I felt so bad for the cheap team until the boys got there and they had there sleepover and fun banter, wholesome
Clicked on the vid saw JJ, Tobi and Ethan got the good team, clicked off. Vik Simon and Harry definitely needs a good team
3 hours long… a little excessive?
DAMN WHY AM I EMOTIONAL AFTER 3H OF PURE HAPPINESS josh really made a movie and  I enjoyed every minute of it
It's as I always say, the H in KSI stands for Humble :)
A banging 3 hour video!!! We need more 3 hour sidemen sundays!
2:58:10 is the best moment in the whole video and proves that u dont need to spend money to make good content cuz the chemistry between them makes those priceless moments
Randolphs comedy sketch had me absolutely dying
Love toby man he’s just so thoughtful and conscientious of his friends.
The ski instructor bit really slowed down the whole video. Not a big fan of that segment
🤠: Yaa
Best VID SO FAR!
WHY DID HARRY SNIFF THE SOCK LOLOL 1:16:18
This was obviously filmed a while ago, as Hazard is not at Chelsea anymore 😂
That transition into Harry running across the bridge 😂😂😂
2:16:38 bro 😂😂
1:41:08
2:12:05 THEN STAND STRAIGHT BRO
the ending sleepover with the boys was beautiful❤
Yoo, do pub golf but in different cities in europe. The one 3 years ago was goated. When i drink with my pals i put it on and its always jokes.
I’m literally Harry when he’s scared of heights
“The whites of my eyes went yellow” -Harry  Homie has got a drinking problem omg
We love Casper. Man’s a wholesome legend
Bruh,  i'm sure the Thumbnail changes every 24hrs 😂
Should send a team to toyko disland and 1 to florida disney where they have to do a bingo card deticated around the disneyland theyre at
1:50:34
has anyone seen that film, your christmas or mine 2, on netflix this video is kinda reminding me of that
1:52:11 😂😂
Wholesome, humble, fun, inspirational and memorable ending. 💚
Vik is always on the bad team. He is so positive he deserve being in the good team for at least once ✨
i feel so sad for vik he's so precious
Vik just not being bothered with cashpur bro, on his phone 😐 and Simon's just gone
1:16:19 harry did not care he went to smell the sock straight away 😭
i kinda feel like if i was on the good time tho id feel forced to pretend like im having a good time, like the nice mansion and fine dining isnt that surprising anymore. But for the bad team they kinda get to make the best of a not amazing situation and seem to have more laughs
kind of love the bad groups outfits they had to wear lol
This was amazing absolute masterpiece the ending was great aswell 🔥🔥🔥
anyone else noticed a change in the work ethic/enthusiasm of the boys since the documentary, seems like theyre all putting in a bit more effort
gotta respect josh for coming up with these videos man
sometimes feels a little insensitive in these videos when the cheap holiday would probs be a dream/typical holiday to some of the fans
genuinely dont think i could ever bring myself to watch a 3 hour movie but a three hour sidement video sign me up haha
harry looks hot af in this video
Winter camping is my fav thing
Three hours long and didn’t skip a second, good show jolly good show👏🏾
Did Tobi get that happy ending?
Ksi has such a bad attidute its crazy
1:04:53 Big boy has entered the chat.
idk man i feel like i would love to be on the cheap team everytime
Why Harry sniffing the sock he traded the cheese for! 🤣
did no one notice that harry sniffed the sock after she gave it to him 😭😭  1:16:17
josh does need to chill w the alcohol
id love to see a video where the bad team just says screw it and goes off and does their own thing that is way better then the good teams trip.
I don’t think I would’ve stopped laughing if Lux, freezy and Randy ran in there and shouted something like yahhhhhh or Swedish and just scared them mostly jj😂😂
Peak Ethan joke: 25:13
1:16:20 😅😅😅
where is that bridge?
Simon and vik should have swapped with ethan and jj
Who the heck is with the boys in the hot tub at the end
what a movie, glad to see the happy ending
Soon vik is gonna start saying “I’m too rich and famous for this” too 🤣😂🤣
The return of Cashper has got to be my favorite thing this year lmao
1:16:20 Harry Smelling The Women’s Sock😂
As I get older these videos get tougher to watch
Did Harry smell the sock 😅😂😂 1:16:18
Nah im kinda getting pissed of that vikk has been on the bad team so many times, and the fact he didn’t get a single vote, and yet he is the most humble and nice every single time
using mainstream music was an amazing idea in this vid
Why tf is this vid 3 hours long 😢
Its mad that sidemen videos are now longer than Avatar films 🤣
The finnish sauna 2:11:15
is no one talking about the fact harry sniffed that random womans sock 🤣
Am I the only one getting sick of JJ’s sulking in every video
1:33:11 love how they dont even have to say. They are all picking Jj 😂
It’s cuz ur black ksi
this felt like a film. loved every second. the sleepover at the end was perfect.
Cheap v Expensive v Josh. Give us what we want to see and make that grey headed man suffer
47:40 lmao
this is sidemen.
I miss the shopping challenges when whoever got jj got screwed
what a video
This vid was 🔥!!
It’s funny how Harry actually smelled the sock and then like 8 mins later in the video ksi starts to sound like a siren
As some one that go morzine year yearly and as wached the good place get built it is so nice to see it finished and looking good
bro the sleepover was the best part for some reason😭. Hopefully Side+ got more footage of the sleepover but another then that W vid Josh 👏🏼🔥
Love these super long travel videos. Actually super wholesome at the end
length of a movie, even got credits and everything 😂
The instructor intro… like why was that needed but why was it so special ❤. so good 1:39:43
Quality video again. Took me several days to finish but worth it
josh cooked
the end was perfect, Josh probably saw it in the final edit and knew he had an absolute banger
Tobi looks fire asf in yellow 23:51
W video lads
harry smelling the sock is insane
Harry seemed proud to be able to say verbier😂😂
Best vid ever
JJ about snow, ice and water “is that an atom, or it’s 2 atoms” 😂
nah how much did they spend on that paradise -coldplay license
yuour mother is with me
Ksi actually ruins every video it’s so hard to sit though these now
Sorry bad team looked to have more fun
Anyone gonna talk about how harry smelt the sock 💀😂
9:00 ksi needa be humbled bro bro is being majorly disrepctful for no reason
That snoring bruh 💀💀💀
Never appreciated how much work goes into these BTS till the credits, wow 😮
2:54:04 underrated joke
The music montages are insane, the production is getting better every time
17:54 he looks like prince harry
02:12:34 was the best moment crazy view 😍😍 goosebumps
that ending scene with all the boys in darkness chatting nonsense was such a perfect end to a banger of a video
This was like a cinema experience! Probably one of the best if not the best sidemen video.
Ksi needs to be humbled tbh
1:25:33 WTF @Miniminter
god I love vik’s positivity on the bad team it always creates a great dynamic, BUT please let this man be on the good team.
1:16:20 Harryyyy…. Wanna explain?
Olabunji olamunji is straight out of order😩🤣
justice for vik
52:53   Vik planning a murder  Harry listening to the plan Simon is 10 steps ahead and already disappearing to execute the plan
kinda weird for them to start the vid at a convention
harry smelled the sock 🤣🤣
Loved the ending
harry looks even hotter in the snowy lighting, ps. actually thought the cinematics were stunning in this video tbf
Toby saying “now I can tell my mum that I can ski” was so wholesome I love it
Time 🕰️ https://youtu.be/OpzE3ogeq2c?si=A2SAfPzXqxIMV2XA
This is a masterpiece ❤
Outtro was awesome
The ending was a banger
harry saying give the camra a kiss vic.... then straight after,  Thats abot weird 😂
Tobi is fighting for his life out on those slopes
Snowboarding ain’t that easy
Petition to make JJ a PERMANENT member of the bad team. No escape, just miserable for him every good vs. bad. He ALWAYS gets bad team. 😂😂😂
1:43:15 😂😂😂
2:13:00 wtf was this cinematic shot, one of the best i saw
I was hoping Simon, Harry, and Vik would actually sack it off
KSI calling out vik to get on the ring LMAO
3h is crazy
Cashper is an absolute G, what a guy! One of the best features on this channel
JJ on the bad team is alot more entertaining 😂😂😂
this  video is a movie love it
1:16:21 AYO HARRY MAN
I really just love Ethan & JJ, Idols to rivals back to idols. The Chemistry is insane 😅
Anyone else think Josh looks like beavo
The only micro aggression I see is on VIKK this show seem to underestimate the people that follow VIKK
Best sidemen video I have seen in a long time
What a video this is
it's so cute seeing the guys laugh and giggle as if they were in middle school having a sleepover XD
The end credits 😂😂
Kasper the 🐐
2:16:41 Harry looks like the big head nose and eyes, but little body in Attack on Titan 😂
Why Tobi is the most caring. JJ laughed at the other team, Ethan laughed at JJ's joke, but Tobi didnt even smile. Stone cold, he genuine felt bad for them
anyone else notice the lack of Kon?
simon doing those guys dirty with a second round of selfies had me gassing XDD
I love the videos- always have. But missing audio and uncoloured clips on a channel that has over 20m subscribers is mad!
Bez and ksi were like huskies😂😂
What does that mean 2:58:10
1:16:19 can't beat a good sniff
that sleepover was epic
3 hour vid, watched it all, surprisingly not once did i wanna turn it off/ skip. loved it
i'm not even hating on the bad team's outfits lol i weirdly kinda like them
2:04:25 how are they not getting copyright for the music??!! Makes the video so much better but how have they managed that 🫨 also where is kon & Kirsty?
27:49 tobi’s laugh while face planting into the snow had me crying
Love this vid, and Cashpur
Ethan is my favouritte sideman
Seriously feel sorry for Vik! He’s never on the good team! Sidemen sort it out and don’t make him feel left out 😫
One of the best sidemen vids, hats off to everyone in the production for this, and of course to the boys themselves.
2:16mins in. I have never laughed so much in all my life.. that is the best clip of Harry I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂😂
YESSSS I LOVE THESE
Ngl about an hour of filler should have been cut out of the vid
The end parts of the video were so good
2:16:40 🤣🤣🤣
Classiccccccccccc
Did no one else notice harry sniffing the woman’s sock hahahahha😂
8:05 😂
What in the movie
Icl ksi ruined the vibe on the bad team
Looking at the credits its crazy to see how many people it took to make this video
End credits with some type of nostalgic song is such a vibe, should be done more. Great Video!
Is that Vladimir Putin
I literally went here on holiday and got chicken pox it was at the hotel with the long entrance by the super market from the bad team
#justiceforvik
How did no one vote Vik he deserved it the most he always shafted
ngl ksi is always the worst in these vids
the jj "what's up dawgie" from the old gta v video sent me back, said it the same way :D
44:16 titan harry
Bruh I dunno how jj just fuckin moans even in the good team my man’s ungrateful af
Video took 3 hours but probably took a week or weeks to edit, thanks for always making Sunday a blessing
The boys at the end just laughing and vibin 😂😂😂classs
idk why i dont like vik. he just doesn’t give the vibe like others. he always serious about stuffs.
👃 🧦
was gonna watch and saw it’s THREE hours bro like come on, make it 30-40 mins MAX then i’d watch
Is it me or is the "im too rich" act from JJ a bit tiresome. Every time he just complains instead of making the most of the momentxD
The intro with Fatboy Slim 😍😍😍😍
Amazing video boys !
Ksi's face when the NPC wanted and took a picture
They need to make a  downloadable itinerary for each of these holiday videos  to do exactly what the sideman have done good or bad.Or have I missed it
Loved every minute 👏🏻
Da 3 nigerians made it
Why is jj just a bit out of touch nowadays calling a young lad an NPC for legit wanting to go skiing, he’s young enjoys skiing and can’t afford a proper hotel so got a hostel, needs must for fun sometimes 🤷🏽‍♂️ really out of touch from jj 8:44
love mumbo tbh long time fan om like 20 accs lmao
My clock went off the same moment that they started Imitating Big Ben
anyone know who the water dancegroup is? seen them before.. thanks in advance
THE ENDING WAS SOOO WHOLESOME AND FUNNY 😂😂❤❤
I hope this is not the last time we see Cashpur 🙏
Outro went hard
Goddamn these just keep getting longer
I would like to see a video of both teams being on the bad team lol would be very entertaining!
El phenomenalé 😂😂😂😂
Harry - She just took it off in front off me   1:16:19   Sniffs it 😂
Certified Sidemen Banget
Man JJ is RUDE
NO WAY GUYS!  Skip to 3:00:58 its mad funny
1:51:50  this bit is too funny
They gotta do a bad vs bad tbh
Best video in bloody ages!!!!!!!
"The hut is a concept more than a building" lmao
Josh, KSI and tobi needs to be in bad team next time
That chalet is unreal 😮
2:51:21 to 2:51:27  JJ sounds like that cat meme
Vik has to be in the good team next time. 😢and he shouldn't be stuck with JJ 🙏🏽
The cinematography and editing on this is Hollywood level
2:04:20 Vibes!!
Not gonna lie L
Reality hit like a f*****king train when 32:40 simon said 31.....
I felt bad for harry when he didn’t want to drink alcohol. Sad to see Josh push him when he wants to make a difference in his life
JJ is never be on the bad team 😂 Feel like he makes everyone miserable when he is that's the reason why they don't anymore lol
the catch at 40:28 was smooth
harry sniffed the sock 😢
The production on this was top tier, the boys are leveling it up even more
Sleep over part 🥺🥺🥺
This is soooooo good 😂😂😂😂😂we need a sidemen sleep over with troops
#continuevikabuse
This was a awesome video!
Good on harry for cutting down on his drinking edit: oops, spoke too soon
1:25:51 😂😂😂😂 outta pocket
Vicky
That harry run caught me off guard 😂😂😂 2:16:49
bruh how many times have Vik been in a bad team vs a good teaM?
I’m meant to be revising for my end of year exams.
Casper is the best person they've had in a video, he was hilarious 😂
Jj is fatneen again 🎉🎉🎉🎉
1:16:18  Harry couldn't resist 😂😂😂😂😂
me not being able to watch side+ saturdays are killing me
LOVE THE SIMON IN IT
The only thing that jarrs me about these videos is the "we won statement" it's 50/50 chance the get good team or bad, they aint done no competition or challenge which would make it ten time more interesting
one thing i found out is i like watching the cheaper team everysingle time. they always try to have fun or laugh at their depressing situation. more fun to watch
randy lowkey did a glow-up😩
Kebab on a Tuesday night pissing it down outside under a blanket whilst watching this absolute banger. HUGE W for Josh hopefully one or 2 more 3hr movies this year. 🔥🔥🔥
bro just sniffed the socks right after that is mental :D
probably one of my fav vids of all time
That ski instructor was so funny lol
In my opinion the cheap side was way better than the expensive but i agree the expensive side was mor luxurious and the cheap one was in a way more funny and enjoyable but still loved the video geet up the good work
the fact that jj always gets the good team, makes these videos boring af NGL
JJ ❌ Vajayjay ✅
👏🏼 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
1:07:00 gekoloniseerd, toch?
3hrs😯😍
JJ walking with his skis was hilarious!!!
Honestly not a “Banger” video. Legit an “Elite” video it was one of the best in a long time,small opinion being that if Tobi wasn’t in the video I don’t think I would’ve noticed and I feel he basically did nothing lol
Felt like a good movie❤
W
W
0:10 United KinDGom
1:16:15 NAAAH HE SNIFFED IT
Josh loves to screw Ethan on these vids 😂😂😂😂😂
JJ not knowing Frankie 😂 bro got no ball knowledge outside Arsenal
Banger video 🔥
Give vik the good team more often, i get its by chance but bros barely had the good team compared to the others
meaw
These boys have gone from making videos in their rooms to making weekly movies. Respect.
SUOMI MAINITTU
Such a good video, up there definitely
Ethan and Harry pool dancing was my favorite part🤣
one of the best sidemen videos I ever watched
What if one of these future trips the teams fly to the same country, but the bad team enters a car and just drives all the way back to England.
no way 3hrs wirth of sdmn sunday content woowow hitting diff
3:00:44 I cried
THE BEST SIDEMEN VIDEO
1:16:20 harry sniffing the sock LMAO😂😂
One of the best sidemen videos for a long time
there aint no way harry took a sniff of that sock 1:16:18
That ski instructor was hilarious  “Vikki”😂😂
The moment they left the bus, those other "people" ceased to exist
Naaahh 2:16:45 is one crazy shot for a music vid😂
vik was such a ray of positivity this video, hoping he gets on the good team in the future he deserves it, love him but JJ needs to humble him himself
2:16:37 The best cut in a sidemen 3 hour video
THAT PARADISE EDIT WAS TOO GOOD
2:13:55
I am shayar
Is no one gonna talk about the duration?
I love the instructor's attitude. Dude so quick on his feet...got jokes for days 😂
Ze require.. schwerabal, ya?
2:22:48 The long awaited Tubbo cameo in a Sidemen Sunday
Shout out to Vik’s attitude even after never being in a good team😤
3hr sidemen Sunday? This gonna be a banger
josh looks like beevo’s dad
Justice for Vikstarr123! That man has never been in a good teamm, nahh fam!😭🫡
1:10:27 this got me so bad 😭😭
Hear me out: Sidemen abandoned but whoever gets there first is the good team 👀
JJ laughing at a 1199$ phone while carrying a 500$ one is funny 9:19
The music intros are amazing continue
The sleepover was the best part
Vik is such a good sport! Loved him in this
What planet are these old dudes from... who the hell doesn't know how to play rock paper scissors?
Sidemen having all those followers and people only recognising KSI bamboozles me so hard!!!
best vid ever 🥶🥶🥶🥶
The black dudes are always put on the same team? 🤔
Another masterpiece
Yessss 3 hours!!!
The pov of Harry running across the bridge was the highlight of the video for me 🤣🤣
Viral🎉
we need a video where both teams are bad
Anyone else bored after an hour
ksi hella fat again
what a banger dude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
f*cking banger
Why is jj get the expensive team only because he is ksi. Vik is always in the cheap team whyy no justice to vik
2:16:49 HARRY LOOKS LIKE A TITAN BRO HAHAHAHA
Banger
Jürgen Klopp was the coach driver 😂
The german guy was quality lmao. Why was no one laughing at him, dude is top tier lol
bro honestly, cheap teams are the bestttt! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
NAH Harry sniffing the sock was wild
Ethan and Jj together are a elite duo😂😂😂😂😂
Completed! ✅
Why didn’t any point out Harry sniffing the sock
1:35:45 it's sad to see.......
Okay that sleepover with all the boys, so cute and wholesome. What a great video!
9:25 lmaoooooooo
we need a sidemen ultimate sleep over
Josh really just dropped a whole movie ❤
Why doesn't Harry like Denmark?? ??
2:12:23 Why does Tobi look like he is about to rap here 😂
Will I watch a 3 hour long movie? No, but a 3 hour long sidemen video? Yes
Video got worse when Randy is in the video
Like the comment to get Vik justice to be in the good team!
I can't believe I've sat and watched a 3 hour video on youtube.
I really want to see, Vikk & Ethan and throw in deji on the good team & the rest on the bad! 😩
That fifa song at 2:03:00
whats the music they played after 24k from bruno when they were introduced at the house (jj ethan and tobi)? that beat was fire
Big ups jager bomb woman she’s dope
Love your videos ❤
The side+ add was acc sick
this video was so good ❤❤
Why did ethan look like a woman at 33:43😂😂
Took me 3 days to finish 🙇🏾 worth it though 🔥🔥
Anyone else see the coldest catch from JJ at 40:25
1:25:32 why is nobody talking about how wholesome that man at the door was 🥺
bez enjoyed the swimming a lil too much
Vik carried the bad team😂
The way josh smiles and says: "We have to go back there is no option" and then laughs is  Definitely in the top 5 evil laughs of the sidemen.💯 We know he is thinking about poor harry and the great content to come with it.😂😂😂
bad team planning to murder the rest :)
change the thumbnail, giant spoiler.
The bad team goes through such a journey and so much more impactful than whereas the good team is just a normal day for the sidemen
I hope in one of these videos all 7 of them are together at the end. I loved the ending in this one. If the other 4 were there it would've been even better.
1:04:27 "these guys looks like some prime ROCK PAPER AND SCISSORS loosers"  XDDDD
2:16:40 Bro, the camera angle😂😂😂
Wait for it wait for it hey guys it’s me vikstar123 he’s way to funny when he wants to be😂😂😂
has kon left the sidemen video stuff? he's not in the videos recently
3 hours????
Vikk is slowly becoming my favourite sidemen, and I'm here for it
2:25:29
2:15:29 Get a load of This girl tryna get on camera
This man said I’ll not let Jesus feed me but Ethan was about to feed this man what’s going on jj😅
3h video is a banger i think too long but i like it
So put me in a video with an unlimited credit card
word of the day: microaggression
Favourite video yet 😂
DAY 2 OF TRYING TO WATCH THIS GARBAGE. 10 mins in and i already wish this garbage wasnt even uploaded.
1:16:19  Bro went in for the Sniff 😭😭
2:50:06 This is another reason vik is elite😂
Tobi is like the bloke from cool runnings that hates the cold 😂😂😂
Kasper with KSI is hilarious hahah
Hearing Casper keep saying " vi Jay Jay " was freaking hilarious, casper was such a great addition to the video
3 HOURS?
Why is JJ so unathletically athletic
Finding out the teams is always pointless as it's spoiled in the thumbnail
Whoever is an XL can I have your ski outfit 😂 love it!
2:04:46 Josh is annoying
I genuinely don't think KSI means bad by how he acts... Its just controversial entertainment LOL
Vik trying to cheer Harry up by making a plan on how to cause a skiing accident for the other team is just priceless hahah
Attack on Guernsey  2:16:40 😂
1:16:19 no one saw harry smell the sock😭
And i thought the 2 hour videos were long
2:16:40 When they finally found your stash
This is a masterpiece! Smiling all the way through! I experienced all of this with u! KINGS!!!!!!
Them saying they picked Harry cuss he likes skiing but he couldn’t even ski? 💀
Not harry sniffing the sock
JJ needs to be on the s*** team for once man
Sidemen are the only people that can put a video out 3 hours long and still get millions of views wild
Even when Vikk is annoyed he’s still so positive i love vikk
Most  ppl will never get to go on the “bad” trip and theyre so ungrateful.. it gives me the ick
The only reason vik doesn't get good team because he always be positive about everything like being in bad team then to he is positive so no one votes him tho go in good team like crying like harry etc etc 😂
Ethan just hates vik , maybe because he knows via is better than him and more famous
i acc feel bad for that one guy asking for a picture on the coach
It’s always so boring when Toby gets the good team, most boring guy in the group shouldn’t be getting the good stuff, waste of content
good is the fun guys on bad team, will be sad 3h to head all 3 cry
dont eat and watch during 2:07:20 - 2:07:46
How can i double like a video?
Jj forehead cam a kill mi fam 🤣
the cinematic to that instructor was like from a move!
Best video ever!
Jj need to learn how to ski 😂
best outro / ending ever. the music the credits BANGING.
W video
The pain piled on with vik left hanging there 😂😂 1:36:42
1:16:18 not harry smelling that womans sock...
The boys at the sleepover😂
Can we get a “I’m too rich for this” count from all videos 😭🙏
IF NEXT TIME VIK ISN'T ON THE GOOD TEAM I WILL START A WARR😭😭 POOR GUY
Simon must be jealous of ksi rn... Cheese 😂
bro why he sniff the sock 🤣🤣🤣
The editing was great on this video and lovely that they used real music
3 hours!!!!???? this definitely is a banger
kudo too the whole team what a blast i've had watching this 👏👏👏
Harry crying about being in the bad team after he spent two days in the Maldives 🙄 justice for vik
I feel like JJ is on some medication that cause him to be weak and moody.
W
lowkey tired of seeing the same dudes on good team. vik should make an absolute stinker and put toby and harry in it lol
Freaking 3hrs 👌
Jesus Christ saves. Repent
Why is JJ always in the good team? I want to see him in the bad one
The man opening the door and going Oh had me
Haryy running like a titan at 2:16:14 had me dying
Nobody:  Every titan on 'Attack on titan' : 2:16:40
Harry smelling the sock killed me!!!! 1:16:18
The editing on this video is peak
Nah JJ really needs to be humbled bro, he was treating the people so rudely
I've never ate dinner this long mannnn
which video is casper from?
Where have I seen that swing and swimming pool combo? 😂😂
God that intro song could not be more perfect!!
Ngl the sleepover was my favorite bit. One of my favorite videos!!
Okay but what would be fun is when they host one of these kind of vids but only JJ being on the bad team and the rest being on the good team. It would be hilarious when ksi throws and tantrum and Harry just laughs like a maniac lmaoooo
I don't know if it's just me, but I feel like JJ has been on the 'good' team quite a bit and Vik has been on the 'bad' team quite a bit too. Would be nice to see things a little more evened out.
Josh the best host🌞
Harry sniffed the ladys sock💀💀
The cheap teams snow suits actually went hard 😂 I’d rather be in that than I would be dressed in all one color looking like a C tier power ranger just sayin 🤷🏼‍♂️😂😂
This is like a movie love it after two stinker weeks
that ski instructor working overtime for jj 🤣🤣
47:37 FACTS SIMON‼️‼️‼️
What's aj doin In sidemen video
This is the best sidemen video in months, maybe years. 3HOURS OF GREAT CONTENT, STORYLINE, CAMERA WORK, HUMOUR, PLANNING.  Props to Josh and the team, more of this please.
2:39:39
I feel like the bad team was really not that bad
EPIC video, sidemen are back on form 💪💪
1:17:36 Simba and Rafiki calling the jungle👂
Can someone tell me where this is in swiss?
Nah that Harry's angle was crazy!!😂
Justice FOR VIKSTAR ‼️
Take caspa on the next trip. Button 🔴
Somebody cooked here.
This was a banging production! 👌 Big up Josh 🙌
Cinematography in this video deserves an Oscar
this video was like a movie with the music and the way the cinematic parts were shot
Why not just buy another snowboard
1:26:09 who tf snores like that😭
2:33:27 that sound of bear skin gripping up of the slide😂
This edit was actually amazing
Class!!!! 🔥🔥
wheres kon?
Best ramadan entertainment the sleep over was sooooo funny
Harry might be worse of a Karen than Simon and ethan
This video was so long that they even added credits 😂also what does a fixer do?
Nr 1 trending let’s go 🎉🎉🎉
2:58:02 funniest part
Fatneek is returning...
More 3 hours videos please I beg
honestly i rather spend my 3 hours rewatching this than rewatching the avengers endgame
German guy ruined the video
The sleepover at the end was jokeeeeee
one of the best vids
Do more of these three hour videos
Everytime vikk gets called vicky i lose it🤣🤣
3 hoursss. Taken me 2 days to finish😂 great vid guys
36:20 sniper targeting simon 😅😅
Simon spitting facts around 47:35
2:59:45
The lizard view of JJ had me dead😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
JJ complaining about skiing as if the good team wasn't doing the same thing.
1:54:00
1:38:26 😂😂😂😂😂
34:33 what game do they play? or how does it work?
Great content!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
my red flake is constantly thinking the teams have a chance at switching, even when there’s like 20 seconds left
Love that they use real music!!🤩
who all thinks vik gets the cheap ones most of the time
Finally KSI holiday song has been featured in a movie 😅... Simon predicted .
harry lowkey looks like ski aggu at a glance
Less of JJ on any good team he just ruins videos
Randolph big D in your ear for disrespecting Jesus Christ ...
This is literally the #LongestSidemenVideo
wtf brother ksi got fat
2:16:40 is exactly the random vibes i need
I refuse to believe the cheap team holiday cost 200$
if there is one thing I like about JJ is that he knows how to enjoy and surfer
Sidemen finally hit 21m subs
This one is best yet lol
Where was the good team staying , in Geneva as well?
KSI is part of illuminati...also he eats children's meat
ETHAN WITH THAT LOBSTER TATTOO HAS GOTTA BE THE MOST AUTISTIC PERSON IVE EVER SEEN
18:14 The sidemen editors dropped the coldest mansion edit ever and forgot to give us blankets 🥶🥶🥶
I enjoy watching these sidemen vacation videos and then visit other places walking around and stuff because I can't afford vacation and this let's me dream a little and see new places around the world I'll never see in person
What lux said in 2:54:20?
Randolf is just a charity case
the end was fire when they go to sleep
1:16:21 Harry smelt the sock 😭😭😭
3 hours of solid entertainment, absolute banger of a vid!! Best parts Cashpar and also harry running across the bridge at mach jesus
This was a mooooovie
Big ups for the man Ethan, love that guy
Josh is so good at hosting cant cap
Randy actually stole the show man wow hahahahaha
am i tripping or did ethan said im really glad and hugged vikk when simon said that vikk never had been on the good team at 1:37:26
2:16:41 Ketamine Titan 😂
Ok so listen anytime JJ is in the bad holiday trip we need more tour guides like Casper and the Vegas trip guys with the green machine! Absolute content!!!
the ending showing love to all the crew and production team was amazing. Loved that little credits scene.
Vikks line at the end. Killed me lol. Stackin straight up
The music in this video just makes it so much better 2:12:50 ❤
am i the only one that doesnt like jj? i feel like he thinks hes too good for them.. hes always in a mood
The two time skiing olympic winner flipped tobi off after his first ever slope
Bringing Casper in was a great idea, guy’s hilarious 😂
Poor Vik
Yeaaaaaaah fat neek is back 🎉😂
@Zerkaa doing best videos imo
JJ and his low efforts!!🤕
A whole movie 🔥🔥
Best sidemen video EVER!!!!!
the expensive team is proof that swirly slides are the height of luxury
all the posh people they met omfg how the other side live 🤣
Soooo they have rights to 24k Magic?
Watching them good team eating while fasting aggghh 💀😂
1:16:00 bro smelled it💀
This might be the best sidemen video yet
Ayo best movie I've seen in a long time can we get more 3 hour long ones? Got to be the best sidemen Sunday to date and there's been a lot of good ens
Best sidemen video to date….
It’s ok for jj to be on the bad team, like how many times does he have to be niced at this point
Harry running over the bridge is hilarious
Always sorry for who ever gets stuck with simon
Constructive criticism:
1:16:13 why did harry smell the sock💀💀
Fat ksi is back
We need more videos this length!!!!!!!
After the whole week of stress, all we need is 3h+ sidemen Sunday... Love yall lads ❤
this was somehow so calming to watch, absolutely love it
It'd be a crime if Cashpur wasn't involved in more videos. By far the best side character we've seen yet.
what an absolute banger for the intro music
what an absolute banger for the intro music
I've never seen Tobi so incapable at anything before, he always seems like he's at least decent at anything
What a banger video, can't wait for more like this 🔥
the "bad team" always gets to meet fans lol
Greatest sidemen creation ever🎉
ending was mint, we need a netflix series of the boys traveling the world
Best ever video yeah I said it
Ramadan karim
One of the best sidemen video ever❤
The music, the editing and JJ slowly becoming Fatneek again does it for me💀
Just finished watching a Sidemen Movie
day 3 of watching the video. Still not close to completing 😅
The dutch people at the bar, got to love my dutchies
2:11:33 love how vik helps the camera man
iI an editor and I feel so bad for whoever edits for the sidemen its 3 hours long that's mental
JJ having an actual tantrum because he’s not on the “good team” despite them doing the exact same thing is so annoying
ITS ALMOST AT 500K BRO
I would've loved to see Harry snowboarding 🥲😩
JJ mocking the bad team and getting Karma was funny 😂 and adding salt to the wound….the same guy he had in his video is telling him to pull it together 😂
That instructor of cheap team needs a raise😂
Why JJ sounds like the siren at the Screaming part
Enjoyed it right up until i saw randy and callux 🙄
Pro tip to me sidemen Sundays more enjoyable skip every bit ethan appears in
jynxi and sketch vs 20 will go hard trust me 20 mill+
1:11:48 once again tells us how vik is just so damn wholesome 😂
Tobis attitude always on point man no matter what he's gotta do
Was a good vid but deffo dragged in a few parts. Justice for Vik on the good team next time 😂
Am i the only one that thinks the whole coach part was cringe and painted the boys out in a bad light?
JJ's a sore loser sometimes and it's not even funny anymore
What a vid
Tobi really deserved the excellent team for coming to Melbourne
40:27 that reflex from jj oh shiiii
crazy he got some copyright music going
i think that the bad the team is the one that makes the better memories! VIk and harry are the bad team carriers
JJ is a stuck up baby, some times the wrong people to go clear
best ending
Who ever is editing these vids NEEDS a raise
The cut to JJ at 2:13:04 took me tf out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Randolph's name is Andrew Shane? Damn didn't know that
I love Vic, he’s amazing so happy and kind 😍😍❤️
1:25:20
Is it me or is vikk hella funny in this vid
1:16:18 , why's he smelling it bruh harry is wild
Best sidemen Sunday video in ages
🔥❤
Sidemen video a giant sleep over with all the troops cuz that end was jokes😂
Awesome vid/film. Congrats. Loved the editing. That fade in and out of the Side+ ad was amazing. Loved the drone work and credits too 👏
Seems like epic movie ❤❤
2:22:34 💀
the guy nutting over the vik intro lmao
Calling him VaJJ is crazy 😂😂
3 hours?
Fatboy Slim!!😁💙🤙 The outro song fits so nice as well. A little bit of mainstream music was a nice addition to this video.
Ethan laughing at Vikk when he didnt get any votes just proves what a sad person ethan is....
this is one of the sidemens best ever videos
For a moment thought it was PHIL 😂😂 1:39:50
the LAST 10 MINS WERE SO FUNNY AND WHOLESOME  I LOVE THE CHEAP TEAM FOR THESE MOMENTS!!
4:31 - Man said, There's normal people on there.... to - I want to die 😂😂
Why does KSI have the shittest phone 😆
Scrap the vs vids and send the guys around the world on adventures as a whole group instead
best movie ever
Vikk is such a vibe
TOO MANY ADS
1:50:27 why did simon just disappear from the bad team for a hot minute 😭😭
y jj so rude to the guy whne all he wanted was a pic
very good video
Harry should not be pressured to drink. That is all.
2:12:43 This is HERITAGE 🫡
This is the first sidemen sunday video where I skipped through the whole video coz it was so unsatisfying😡😠
GTA boots colours would of been sick
The ski instructor Kaspar has been one of the best features in all sidemen videos up there in the top 10 fr 😂
How About a holiday in South Africa🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Damn zosh cooked hard on this video. 3 hours went like nothing !
Bez was right this is the best sidemen video ever
JJ looks like that Travis Scott fish meme😂😂😂  1:14:51
Chills! 2:12:45 Pog!
THIS IS GOING TO BE THE MOST VIEWED SIDEMEN VIDEO.
Ending was sooo good
Best sidemen vid ever
What a unnecessarily long & boring sidemen sunday😑😔😤😴😪
9:25 The way he just ignored Tobi
Nice sniff there Harry.
What a vid!! The ending was the best, big ups sidemen ♥️
Would love to see a sidemen sunday prank where both teams are bad
Ethan looks like a pool ball 😂
Why is no one talking about Harry STIFFING the sock at 1:16:20 😭😭
We know that vikk have NPC humor and stuff but they have to stop treating him like he's the most boring person bro. Even JJ last video did that and just stop trying to have fun because of the mindset "vikk is boring so today will be boring no matter what".
If they're the good team, why put them on the slopes as totally spies?
Movie Vibes
56:47
Harry gets pampered too much. W Vikk optimism and positivity.
why are sidemen went from creating youtube videos to movies even longer than endgame
Why has minter nd Vik stopped drinking?
2:07:20 jj’s nose are so big u can see someone hiding inside
SDMN GIVING QUALITY CONTENT
That was the most cinematic sidemen sunday ever.Vik deserves better.I feel so bad for him🥲
The sleepover at the end was just pure old sidemen vibes
Requesting a sidemen strength video last one was over 4 years ago.
1:16:19 wtf 😭
This is perfect, the last bit was.....🔥
Lmao 2:16:49 Harry running with that camera angle had me dying and especially since he was whining that it was shaking 🤣
OMG Zerkaa did them dirty there 😂😂 49:25
2:53:02 No shot, i was saying Caspar Lee in my head lmao, sorry g...
What's with 33 yr bog ur 28 !!!😂😂
The editing in this video mwah *chefs kiss* worth the wait!
2:16:40  harry if he was in attack on titan
Good team coming like the SIDE Rangers😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
2:43:14 It just looks like they're drowning...
Felt like a damn movie
2:16:41 Comedy Masterpiece 😂😂😂
1:16:19 Harry 🤣
Why this PAGE has still 21 million??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! ❤
Vik is so sweet and deserves everything good his way❤❤❤
HOLY A 3 HOUR VID BEST DAY EVER
Put Tobi on the bad team and vik on the good team
Vik Is Too Kind Of all ❤
good team ghost adventure and bad team ghost adventure
This was a banger video
Does Harry have Gilbert's syndrome? he mentioned his eyes turning yellow, i my self have it. Its a liver problem so W on him for trying to take caution. Best not to drink much if at all and stay away from strong painkillers that are hard on the liver.
2:07:22 was the best thing ever (besides getting spat on) lmao
What a bangerrrrrrrr🎉❤❤
Actually up there with one of the best holiday vids, think having rand, call and frez go to bunk with them was nice...great vid 😂
Simon was right about Harry just moaning and getting his way a lot of the time
there's gotta be one where the bad team get to join the good team at the end
This is not a video,this is a movie
I swear ethan and jj gotta be the funniest combo
i just watched the best best sidemen video to exist love them
Bad team always looks the best team
grate vid guyes! keep smashing it all daye every daye! SIDEMEN ON TOP WOOP WOOP
The editing in this video is phenomenal, its like watching a movie
like a lil movie <3333
1:51:48 harry being pestered :(
"olebanji ollumanji"💀
Tobi is in his self-care era, first a Wax and now a facial + massage 😤💅
soon the videos will be 10 hours
Production out of this world, absolutely insane vid, please more of this :)
Is it just me or where the bad team fits actually fire😂🤷🏼‍♂️
1:50:00 break timestamps
Finally a video that I can watch as 5 parts while I'm eating. 1 1/2 Day covered 😊 Other videos 2 or 3 part😁
YALL LET VIK BE ON THE GOOD TEAM FOR ONCE ffs😭
2:18:00 Humble
I feel like its always the same teams and they're always so rigged
vik 😬1:36:42
Harry Kane is from England not the neverlands lol
At this point everyone wants JJ to suffer including his own fans😂
49:16 😂
1:39.32The casper/cashper intro edits were fireee ngl...i just love ths whole video honestlyyy❤❤❤❤❤
1:34:17 VIK LOOKS MAD LENG HERE
Completed darkness “he’s going in cardiac arrest”😂😂
Can we get another video with phill it’s been two years.
Damn man i feel bad for Vikk
I get the feeling deep down Vik likes being on the bad team
Smashed it
The first video where Ethan actually added value and wasnt an NPC, good lad .... for now 😊
What are those cards Ethan & JJ were playing with?
1:18:26 onwards had me dead lmao
Honestly a banger!
I want Casper in every Sidemen Sunday!
36:49 😂
Simon was about to get sniped at 36:25
The second part of thise video when JJ joins bad team it's get boring
33:45 😂
Harry run across the bridge lool
casper in the next sidemen among us please
I just had to skip through this way too long and boring
PLZ SIDEMEN INRODUCE NEW TRACKS LIKE BEAST WE WOULD LOVE TO WATCH IN HINDI
Josh did an excellent job with this video 👏
Harry didn’t want to drink
1:48:12 where is miniminter
2:16:48 Harry giving Attack on Titan vibes 😂 that one creepy mf lmao
The way this video was edited was absolutely incredible, love the vibes!
Sidemen sleepover edition would be amazing 😂
Easily the best youtube video I ever watched,the end was absolutely a treat for a true sidemen fan❤.
Next time vikk will be on the good team and tobi on bad team for as long as possible
2:38:38
What is stacking strain up? 2:58:09
Nobody gonna talk about harry smelling that sock at 1:16:20 ?
Mushu laughing 😂😂😂
01:35:29 shows that vikk will be the first one to leave  the Sidemen
3 atoms
The ending
Bangerrr
disney movie ahh outro ( loved it )
vik's genuinely my favourite sidemen. hes so underrated i swear this man deserves so many good teams, people talking about tobi's good karma wheres vikstar'S? So much love for that man, amazing video
This was such an awesome video!
2:10:43 This man just started yodeling out of nowhere. LOL
At this point jj is just irritating 😢
Ngl the bad team won
Boys: 1:17:30
The sock on the shoe at 1:18:35 killed me 🤣
The teams for sure are not random 😂
Movie
Petition for Vik to be on the good team😂
it's been many years..... we want the Sidemen Spicy challenge  especially including  JJ Olatunjiii
Both teams rounding off their days with wavelength and good vibes is just 🤌
At the end of the day, the cheap team has the best memories
2:21:10
I love the way JJ talks to his food😂
One of the best endings to a sidemen video ever for sure 💯
So proud of Harry and all the heights - I’m petrified so seeing that is a massive feat! All the guys facing fears and pushing themselves was great to see too
Josh’s vids are always insane
JJ has actually become so insufferable 💀💀
That was sooo sick 🔥
That ending is what it's all about, having the best time with your mates 💯
Vik's reaction to seeing the boys is unbeatable 😍
2:16:45 it's an abnormal titan 😂
That cheap team ending was so peak and wholesome 😍
best sidemen sunday of the year
Jesus was a Galilean not American.
1:16:20 why did bro smell her socks 😭😭
Genuinely one of the best videos ever.
Jj got that Jon jones build rn 😂
Forcing someone to drink who doesn’t want to is not ok.
I think Vikstar should leave Sideman NOWWWW
Longest film I ever watched in 1 sitting
i work in -20
Great video and all, but this video has copyrighted music written all over it 😂
1:16:19 harry?
by far the best sideman trip video by far !
VIK needs to be the host next time
What a vid mate!  Josh aka ZERKAA ❤
Harry smelling the sock😂
i wish i could even afford to skii. only went once at school to italy and its so fun. i wish jj put more effort into learning it
just not it.
Peak moment 2:16:41
ethan and jj have most it xD
The hell 3 hrs 😂❤️
good ending funny sleepover!
Poor Vick😩 shame he wasn’t treated and respected the same as everyone else 😢
Bros calling  his fan a NPC is wild😭💀
These people be complaining about the "bad team" as if I wouldn't give my left ballsack to go on some of the experiences they do.
43:14 I should not have been drinking 😂😂😂
this vid banged already lmao
The camera angle of JJ at 1:00:00😭😭😭
1:05:59 Ayo why they close the door like that? 🤨
Attack on titan 😂 2:16:41
icl vik in these vids is so annoying, all he does is scream about how much ‘pain’ hes in and he waffles so much
Harry smelling the sock killed me 😂😂😂
this is literally the best sidemen sunday yet.
1:16:17 Harry smelling the woman's sock 😂
1:48:02
why kon is not fliming with them anymore????
It amazes me how quickly JJ gets out of shape
After watching this we need a sidemen sleep over
The minute before the boys slept had me crying laughing 😂
I like it when cal and cal show up for vids just wish it was earlier
3hr sidemen Sunday? This gonna be a banger
Va J J has to stay. We cant let that die
Maybe next time do two bad teams without let them know there is no good team 😅
mannn i dont know why but , i dont like it. , no one voting for vikk. , man i really made me sad , HE NEVER GETS THE GOOD TEAM IN THE FIRST PLACD AND THEN , NO BODY VOTES FOR HIM
Kasper is a national treasure...we need more kasper in the future
this is a new level of youtube, amazing job joshy boy
2:46:41 the greatest transition ive ever seen😂😂😂😂😂
do people still find jj funny like genuinely not even hating just feel like hes no longer funny and just does the same thing every video if hes even in the video
2:42:43 tf was going on here 😂😂
damn vik should have gotten it
ending was aww🥰😥
Ah the love from JJ to vik is just brilliant 2:13:23
As much as this video hits, I think a Vlog style Sidemen and Troops skiing holiday would have been a brilliant sidemen Sunday. No challenges just the guys having fun
Ksi made this vid 100 times funny I can't stop laughing 😅
Can jj stop being a sook
1:14:47
yay for a 3hr sidemen sunday
1:36:57 look how excited is Harry 😁🤣
they got the rights to so many banger songs
Love the long form content! Best sidemen Sunday yet
2:04:48 aye bro watch yo jet, watch yo bro WATCH YO JET
Crazy how Vikk always gets the bad team
1:16:19 harry sniffs lady’s sock🤣💀
bro josh COOKED
2:56:14
Sidemen sleepover has to happen, that bit at the end was absolutely hilarious 🤣
The ski instructor calling KSI “Va-JJ” (Vagina) 😂
1:25:56 wtf😂😂😂?
8:49 "we are not on the bad team we're on the cheap team"!  i love tobi's positive vibes!
56:49 den gjorde  fandme ondt
Boys Start using Ur insta posts for thumbnails it will make U standout like mad
The intro song is a BANGER
That ending is so wholesome. It's like a boys sleepover which I bet they haven't really had in a long time
The production is on top!!
this is honestly the best sidemen video ever 😂❤️
this envelope is blue u are the good team viks humour is underrated .......        .........           - ________________
Cashper is honestly so good
Simons team actually had more fun tbh nd come on Josh u had to put viksta on the good team this 1 thats actually unfair
2:43:56 bro cal is too funny
The bad team does create good memories 😭
Vik should be in the good team once in a while?
„I would never let a mad put meat into my mouth” also ksi 40:24
Editing on this was amazing, W vid from Josh
Vik's last name is Barn? wtf 3:00:00
jj with monkey bars and camera angle was amazing 😭😭😭
2:16:40 Attack on titan, TITAN POV
The last 3 mins of the boys just laughing is the best moment
Feeling sad for vik 🤧🤝
NGL this is one of the best sidemen Sundays ever. The cinematic view with great music. It’s amazing
nah that bit at the end was pure vibes. Great content as always 🤣🤣🤣
That ATOM, Is that an a um? Well it’s two a ooms 33:28 (it’s not)
Bro JJ being so ungrateful and just whining the whole time going down the mountain with the ski instructor, is so annoying if I was there I would be trying my best to have a good time and he complains that he’s not having a good time but isn’t even trying smh he should be humble
can we vote vik out of the sidemen
S Tier video just wish that people who didn't complain about being on the bad team (Vik) were rewarded with the good team, rather than the complete opposite... It was a coincidental vote though
40:24 "Cmon boi" had me LMFAO
JJs behavior is extremely embarrassing. For him.
JJ is unbearable
That guy that kept calling him Va-JJ 🤣🤣🤣 loved that
One of the best sidemen video ever 🤌
What our latest sidemen short😂 Vik Destroys JJ
Bro they smashed this video my favourite part was at 2:12:45 it looks so beautiful with the shots and paradise by coldplay. They we're right when they said that this is a movie
1:01:38 that edit though 😂
The fact the vikk never lost hope of getting switched to the good team 🥹
1:16:20 Harry smelling the sock is CRAZY
Arguably the best sidemene  ending  of  all time love the troops! 2:58:59
This proves Simon is actually the backbone for sidemen  Josh, Tobi and Ethan don’t rate Vik and it’s so obvious
This my best Sidemen video all of time ❤
Justice for Vik honestly. Has gotten so many bad holidays and he is such a big skier and none of the guys chose him to switch. Vik needs a good team holiday
What a wholesome 3 hr videos sidemen fans must be jerkin off for this video 😂❤❤❤❤
The amount JJ falls over, I'm thinking he really enjoyed being lifted back up by Cashper.
Lowkey sus how Tobi always ends up in the good team
2:50:15 vik’s an absolute legend!!!!
One thing about KSI he’ll behave like a snob
Bog JJ and Ethan on the good team pls
46:00 1:27:43 1:30:25 1:33:00
Do a Asian cheap vs expensive!
Whoever edited this video deserves a raise
honestly one of the best sidemen sundays. the whole thing was absolute peak and the ending with the music and all them as friends laughing and having such a good time was so wholesome. this one is number one on my list
Kasper & jj such a funny duo 😂
bangers every week
JJ on the bad team would have been absolute cinema
Literally one of the best sidemen sundays in a while. Production was mad
Fatneek is back😂😂😂
Just completed watchin this ... This video is a bangerrr🥶
The comedian and JJ bounced eachother very well...no pun intended :)))
It was a banger ❤
Epic video😂😂couldn't stop laughing at the end😂😂
Cashpur was hilarious in this
This may be the best Sidemen Sunday ever.
People sleeping on how great this video was directed😍🙌
That ending in the cabin 🤣
"Can a man not try an better his life" lol felt that
This was a movie, with the new addition of actual music in the edits
On God, Vik is the most amazing and positive guy...idk why he doesn't get votes to be on the good team
INSANELY GOOD VIDEO, i felt like i was watching a movie/documentary of friends hanging out. REALLY good augh i miss it already
2:47:00
Josh hanging out with the bad team was wholesomee
Congrats with 21 mil🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
1:18:26 was the absolute funniest moment 😂
this is fireeeeeeeeee
after 3 days I finally finished this video
Bro no way 6 mil views but NO ONE LIKES THE VIDEO???? what’s wrong with yall??
I love that at 1:16:19 Harry smells the sock 😂😂
felt like an actual movie with the ending credits LOL
was not prepared for 2:16:39
This isn’t even a sidemen video. This is a sidemen feature film
vikk is so postive in this video, big up
Should get the bad team to wait on the good team hand and foot
Bro the bad team is like my luxury holiday
3 HOURS?! LETS GOOOOO
1:52:18 Harry being Harry (autistic)😂
Mental.. smashed it..
Shoutout the troops, made the ending hilarious 🤣
Auschwitz was wildin
Favorite video so far from them🔥🔥
2:38:43 what if that was JJ's piss
Saw 3 hours and thought there was no chance I’d watch this. More out of spite.   Caved in … great sidemen Sunday!
1:16:42☠
The ad was amazing
no shot Harry smelled the sock 😭 bro is acoustic
24:52 "My dad just texted me. Air crash investigation at nine... I might have to tune in"
Theres 0 way the bad teams holiday was 200 that has to be minimum 2k
I honestly thought JJ would pick Vik, since they were on the same team last video
THIS VIDEO IS A BANGER!!!🫡🗣️
This’ll take me about 3 working days to watch all of it 💀
the fatneek is makin a return
im 2hrs in and i completely forgot.... what place is this lol...? nvm its switzerland
sidemen movie… group hug!
The ending is so funny, great video
The credit roll at the end was hard
this whole video was sick, big up josh
Love the 3hr video need more of them
i absolutely lost it at harrys run at 2:16:40
Best one yet
Josh’s nocta jacket 🥶
ksi got fat crazy
What a Sidemen Sunday. Literally enjoyed every second of this 3 hours rich vs poor winter holiday.
Josh Masterclass
Vik deserves justice
3h wasted
Honestly the bad teams outfits were better than the good team
Are they being laser scoped by a sniper ? 36:30
Big up zerkaaaaa
Does it make me a bad man if I laugh every time JJ complains?
Music in this video makes a difference! Love it :D
bro 43:13 that cheese look hella good
this deserves som PPPLATnum
who dosent know rock paper scissors?
https://youtu.be/qVfsVCu6KxY?feature=shared Sidemen new unreleased video loaded roast bts
once again simon brings  video down lol boring dude
2:07:17 jj has me laughing so hard at 2am😭🤣 love this video
Might be one of the best sidemen videos ever. Big up to the Troops coming over to the bad team, that looked like honestly such a vibe bro
“Why do I have condoms 🤨” -JJ *instant scene cut* 😂
Vik held it all together until the very end and he just couldn’t cope anymore 😂😂😂😂
JJ lowkey be hatin on poor people nowadays 🤣
Josh didn’t cook. He become a 5 star Michelin chef with this one. Love the fact there was credits too. Take a bow Josh.
Harry just sniffed that women’s sock 1:16:19
loving the new direction especially with the licensed tunes - just makes it extra quality - top vid!!
I'm so happy Cashpur made a return. He's so entertaining
As usual the bad team is the one I would pick
The boys sleepover was something
2:16:41 bro literally looks like Phineas from Phineas and ferb 😭😂
Petition for Vikk to be on the good team next time. Btw that man looking chiseled
This is what we needed🤣
3 hours of great content!! Please give us longer sidemen Sunday's like this!!
Summer Holiday Cheap vs Expensive South Africa Edition
The Coldplay moment at the top is on point great editing josh
2:21:35  Harry and Josh been on one lately been a lot of sussness going on between the two
next level video :)
bro, this was insane
1:38:00
i aint watchin allat
I genuinely think Vikk should leave sidemen...these guys don't treat Vikk nicely mann.he deserves better
Josh is my new favourite character
Mfs got credits now
ksi has gotten so big his legacy tattoo looks like it says legendary💀💀💀💀💀
feels bad for vik 25:35 especially after last video
Man up JJ
Best Birthday Present EVER!!
Banger!!!
Banger I love the long videos
omg the ending man 😂☠☠☠
Why is nobody talking about how hairy sniffed the random women’s sock from right off of her foot😂
i want to know where he got the retro suits
Better than most movies
Vik really carried this video
Bro JJ moaning gets old after a while. Vik the real MVP for keeping the vibes up the whole time, otherwise the bad team would’ve been horrible to watch. Give Vik a good team tailored to him!  Also Vik not getting a single vote to switch is horrible tbh. Harry has lots of water sports and such that he loves doing, but vik’s main sport is skiing. He should’ve gotten the switch
what a movie 👏
Please do one of these with angry ginge and Danny Aarons, it would be utter chaos in a great way
Nothing beats the old school sleepover vibes with the boys 2:58:00
I swear us boys’ sleepover is always the same when we in bed but we start making noises every single time 😂😂
Vik : I just wanted a vote 🥺
The Attack on Titan version of Harry running over the bridge should be made into a GIF - someone please send to me hahaha
Sometime ksi reminds me of Scooby-Doo when he laughs
That sleepover was wholesome
Josh did amazingly this time
One of the best Sidemen videos I’ve watched in a while, Bravo Sideman 👏
credits were sick
1:16:19
The more of these videos I watch the more I realize vikk is seemingly way kinder than the rest of the sidemen and him offering to film so his cameraman can focus on skiing safely was very sweet to me
I enjoyed this whole video. But the end… that had me sent🤣🤣🤣
Loved ksis song for the swimming part
33:43
Seeing jj fat after doing the obstacle course caught me off guard 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wish any of the boys having a terrible time wasn’t as funny as it is. Got me feeling like a bad person for laughing so much. 😂
Making a two time Olympic medalist train someone who’s never skied before was so pointless and lowkey disrespectful 💀💀
2:00 "i knew the Nigerians are gonna be togethe"😳
JJ moaning and whinging on the bad team ruined this video
8:53 "Yo bro just ask for the picture, worst he can do is say no"
Simon is so underrated, I think he saw Vik was genuinely upset and tried to be extra nice to him in the whole video.
why don’t josh force Tobi to drink alcohol 😮 instead of harry
I wanna see KSI on the bad team for once.
Harry is on a different Spectrum 2:16:40
Yeah this is just not fair anymore. Vik keeps getting the bad team. And JJ keeps getting the good team. Jj should get consecutive bad teams in at least 5 videos. This isn’t fair. I feel bad fir Vik. Josh is just bullying him now
best sidemen video yet
3 hours blud 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
2:12:30 goosebumps man!!!!
They might loose vik after this one xD He would've gotten so much out of the good team's day 🥲
The shots and the editing on this was movie quality. The sidemen are still outdoing themselves, good vid
Jj is such a whimp  I acc dont enjoy watching him anymore
Vik carried the bad team. We all can agree that vik doesn’t get the respect he deserves by the other boys.
The fact that the bad holiday can be someone’s best experience is crazy gotta get my money right
viks my fav sideman
RANDOLPHS NAME ISNT RANDOLPH?????????????????????
I would love to cook for them that is if they like Asian food
I loved it I love the trips they have. I couldn’t stop laughing.  God I love these guys. All of them have their own beauty inside them. They are so funny
Big up editor man, sound effects and music was lit
i swear Toby never been on a bad team. how is he getting away with this
3 hours ?!!!
53:10 Harry thinking why is vik still talking😂😂
"Frenkie de Chong" 😂
Vro this actually a movie 🤯🤯
Josh being supportive of the bad team in the first day was good vibes..they were so sad before Josh came😂
I would really love a holiday video in which both teams think they’re in the good team
Don’t usually comment on things like this but if Harry is truly getting yellowing eyes from drinking pls boys don’t push him to drink anymore! Sign of major liver issues from that.
1:18:25 had me dying 😂
Josh is such a good host for being with the bad team when he could’ve just stayed with the good team the whole time, i also feel bad for the guy they called a npc, crazy
Thumbs up 👍🏼 for Vik being on the good team next video ✅
Thumbs up 👍🏼 for Vik being on the good team next video ✅
Justice 4 Vik!! ❤
This was unnecessarily too long. Almost half of the video is just filled with boring bits.
Sleepover at end was so goated
Type shiii
1:18:20 almost 30 yr old btw 😂
someone find me kashpers socials this dude is jokes
1:16:20  Why'd harry sniff her sock
this might have the best moments of a sidemen sunday of all time .
Where is the place where Ethan , Josh Tobi are skiing???
Viktim 😂😂😂
the sleepover at the end was so funny
Simon and KSI are some low energy guys in the slopes
Im not seeing enough cashpur love
Why does vikk always get the worse holiday everytime
Casper taking them down stairs instead of just turning was too good 😂😂😂😂 1:41:00
Casper made that video so much better had man in stiches
The end was perfection. I need a sidemen sleepover video, also including freezy, Randy, & cal
I was DYING at JJ’s tirade against Vik 😂😂😂 “Oh we gonna spar mate” after punching the ground killed me!!
Josh should take a break from hosting imo
Might go down as on of the best sidemen sundays
the intro gave me chills, that was so coldddd  🥶  🥶  🥶
Ethan’s chin in the hot tub looked like a 💩 floater
The fact about spring onions is is completely wrong and makes no sense.
that was so incredibly edited
The world: Oppenheimer was really long.   Sidemen: Hold my vodka.
Bro the npc reaction in the bus got me dead 😭🙏💀💀
1:36:40 vik getting put in a compilation with this one for sure
I officially never want to meet any of these people besides toby or vik the rest are npcs
JJs such a manchild
I don't think enough people are actually like taking this in properly, Sidemen just released a 3hr vid with credits rolling at the end. They have legit gotten so big they're basically making movies every Sunday now. Mad props to the boys and the whole crew! This is next level!
vikk's baby suitcase 😭💗
WHOEVER EDITED THAT INTRO DESERVES AN AWARD AND A STANDING OVATION.
2:39:30 Is it just me or does Harry look in decent shape?
I love Casper 😂😂😂
Vikk and JJ carried this, Only ones that kept it entertaining
This is honestly one of my favorite videos of the sidemen
the end credit scene actually went so hard
One of the best videos to date boys well damn done
1:04:52 it looks like buddy is about to try to knock Simon out? Lmao wtf
Production on this is wild
The wholesomeness of the sleepover at the end was immaculate
These mfs give vikk the bad team every single time. KSI always gets the best team. They do lot of partiality.
I absolutely loved this video! I love that it was so long as well ❤ the teams were so good and funny throughout 😂❤
JJ makes these videos so boring to watch. He is so exhausting most of the time.
Josh is the best host for these sorts of videos
Respect to Zerkaaa What a Legend !!!!!!   He Smashed all the other Sidemen vids to pieces !!!   All the other Sidemen were entertaining but Josh Is The MVP!!! No one can say nothing about this guy!!! He’s vid idea’s & the way he sets the challenges is Sik!!!!  Ps. F Tobi the neek!!! Tired of him playing this I’m Tobi I’m humble blah blah blah act!!! Send him the Bad Team for the next three vidz, make him eat Sh*t
Not going to lie if I could pick I would do the bad team for the experience
the color grading of the bad team is crisp
How are they using copyright music all of a sudden??
If Harry doesn’t like is outfit I’ll take it what size is it?
🔥
2:16:40 to 2:16:51 are the ugliest and funniest thing I've ever seen in my life
The ending was super cute and wholesome I loved this video
It is refreshing to see eathsn enjoy himself and get a happy ending
WWWWWWWWW
Harry a freaking crybaby
Im waiting for the day that they do one of these. But there is a trick that both teams are actually thr bad team.
1:16:18 harry just smells the sock 😂😂😂
Day 3 of trying to finish the video
Vikk deserves a good team holiday he's got a lot of bad luck recently
For some reason I feel Vikk and Harry aren't going to be around for a long time now. Let's enjoy this as long as possible.
the bad team always has more interesting content to be fair
Your my everyday
An I the only one that would prefer to be on the cheap team
oooh copyright music
These videos never get old👏👏
Man KSI on the potatoes has killed me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ksi looks like a jacked JID
the boys sleepover at the end had me CRYING
2:58:10 This is on par with Vikkstars' "Is it just me" lmfao
Viks voice crack💀💀💀 2:22:56
how can i get an ad saying starting a business is like climbing a mountain midway through them being on a mountain😂
JJ is so insufferable. Jesus. He needs the attention on him at all times.
Huge congrats boys one of the best videos I’ve seen! Felt like I was watching a movie with my best mates
That clip of someone snoring was so good 😂😂 Harry's face was priceless
Ending was 🐐
Good video
Salute to the editors 🫡
Bro when Simon went for a first pump did that dude try punching him when the bodyguard stepped in😭
Just noticed its 3 hours long
Favorite sidemen video
Literally a movie 👏🏾
some of the nicest people
jj actually made this video unbearable around the 2 hour point, he should really work on humbling himself. I know that hes doing it for the views and whatnot but it is plain annoyance at this point.
BLESSED with 3 hours of sidemen sunday
They got the credit scenes aswell HAHAHAHA
try do something new this getting old just like zekaa
did that man actually just sniff a dirty sock from a female stranger
ksi lookin a bit chunky ngl
they should do a sidemen holiday but with couples team so like talia and simon and other couples on a team etc
Bland video tbh. The challenges/tasks and activities kinda sucked. Vik is the only reason this video will do decent. He carried this video cause everyone else was bland
what brand are the ski suits that the bad team was wearing
stop making harry drink
JJ getting fat again
Love the longer format videos, haven't laugh this much in a long time, banger of a video XD
MORE CASPER
Ksi saying dawgy brought back memories
Did anyone notice a lazer pointing at Simons head😂
Swap the teams next time. I wanna see Vik, Harry and Simon on the good team 😭😭😭
Let Ksi host the next one 😂😂😂
I fkn LOVED the ending of this video, top tier sleep over. LOVED IT!!
Has Toby ever been on the bad team??😂 can’t even remember when the last time😂
1:26:00 the best moment of this episode😂😂 harry got scared for a second😂
2:16:40 THIS IS FUNNY AF 🤣
That ending gave me goosebumps, unbelievable camera work, great soundtrack very retro just loved very minute of this video 👏🏻
vik was such a ray of positivity this video, hoping he gets on the good team in the future he deserves it, love him but JJ needs to humble him himself
has anyone actually finished the video?
JJ is like a hippo😂
1:16:19 harry just smells it lol I’m dying.
Vik is the GOAT
Whoever did the music selection for this vid, is a fcking legend, banger after banger Also, fairplay to Kashper man, the guy is jokes, and he killed it in the hotel video too, so he deffo should be in more videos
JJ and Ethan enjoying the hot tub was so wholesome
WWWW VID
Seems like Ethan's completed the marriage thing.. he's getting more and more into other willies 😅
44:53
that sock sniff 🧦🥸😅
Sidemen just never disappoints ,,,, BANGER OF A VIDEO"""""""""
Sidemen entering their film era
What a vid!!
2:58:10 What does that even mean?? 💀
KSI showing exactly why his dad never hugged him when he was younger
Best part of the video was the last 2 minutes 😂😂😂
Ksi should stay on the good team no content on the bad team imo
I think the bad team looked they had more fun this week Got on with it enjoyed it 😊
winter
Omg the last parts for the bad team had me dying 🤣
Watching this with £52 in the bank 😂 I do love 3hours of sidemen Sunday though
The longest video I have ever watched on YouTube
Harry’s fit looks good tbf
Vik needs more love man 😭
How is the game with numbers called near the end of the video?
Tobi completing that obstacle course ain’t gonna stop the accusations 😂
hard film cl
This one banged
this was one of my fav things so far we’ll done josh u are amazing and the sidemen ❤
Cashpar is the absolute best 🤣
One of the best videos ever top 10 at least. The boys cooked the movie of the century right there.
Vik is a legend 🐐  #justiceforvik
Ksi was annoying on the bus
Everyone just glossing over the fact Harry smelled the lady's sock after she took it off, LOL 1:16:18
WHO LET JOSHUA BRADLEY COOK?
43:02 rare footage of Babatunde discovering cheese 😂
2;58;02 , this conversation made the whole video, with James' laugh, JJ calling vik an NPC, taking the piss outta Lux 🤣🤣
Need Kasper in more videos
the cut from the crazy drone shot from the mountain bridge to jj falling in the snow was peak comedy
Why did harry look like calfreezy on that bridge with that cam angle
The sleep over part was hilarious. They have a sidemen Sunday sleepover.
I love long videos, is that just me
Casper is my favourite sideman
josh the best host
😭😭😭😭 the ending sleepover is everything
1:15:48 anyone else notice them almost get taken out by the motorcycle?
At least tobi didn't complain and gave it ago and then theres JJ crying about it maybe Don’t gloat
It is truly mad like Ethan said how humans have 1 found these places and 2 made them look like this. Its unreal the things that have been built up in so remote locations it's truly mental. The sleep over with all the boys too.
2:42:00 that’s a good re-accruing joke 😂
Caspar was hilarious man great job
Yall should have both teams be the bad team, then when they swap they expect to be the good team but it's just worse
please go to asia😃✌️
As if I’ve watched a 3 hour video 😂
1:09:13 How did they get so popular in town in a few hours???
JJ’s a brat😭
If SidePlus posted an edit where they cut out all of the scenes with vik in I’d play for it
What’s the song at 2:04:40?
https://youtu.be/Qbz1k90NjYQ?si=hDmxpnROwuhOexhg
I want ksi to be in a bad team just to suffer more. it will be more entertaining 😂😂😂
This was a 3 Hour-Long Banger! The Editing, the Cinematography. Respect to Josh for the Directing, as always. This one fr felt like a movie. Hope they do more vids like this.
Vikk so positive, he's the goat man
the camera pan to jj on the red run is the best moment of this video lmao
Banger
Dont do vik like that it's sad to watch him like this and even after that he is so positive
make more man
Being on Vik’s team is bad enough, let alone actually being on the bad team. That’s a double whammy.
Banger 🎉
I would honestly love to spend some time hanging out with these guys no cameras no pics I wouldn’t even brag that I spent time with them.    I would genuinely love to hangout with theses lot.   They just seem so wholesome and genuinely fun
id love to see one where they both end up getting the good team in a big reveal then they boys just have a great night all together
How come they use copyrighted music?
Vik is awesome
This is supposed to be one of the big ones... and it flopped. Sidemen fell off a little sadly? Anyone else think so?
the editors have been going CRAZY 😂
Nah this was a lil mad to be honest 9:10
This is hilarious...my name is Geneva...😂
1:38:57 I think Ethan got a bit too excited😂
Vik should be banned from snow boarding 😂 ngl
So all I need is cheeses to get women's socks
The ending music camera shots credits everything masterpiece 🔥😍
Vicky V-jj and Simone are the best nicknames ever Kasper is the best
The credits at the end are awesome giving those behind the scenes credit is a class act
Harry actually sniffing the sock at 1:16:19 is wild
I agree with JJ.  I went skiing once and it’s the absolute worst.   But I would love to be in that bridge and see that breathtaking view
2:16:40 killed me😂😂😂😂 what is bro doing😂😂😂😂
Who agrees these videos are better without jj these days, i’m sick of his rich mentality it’s such a downer
JJ’s hair down is a shout to be fair
BANGER
I thought Simon was getting assassinated
Sidemen should do last to fall asleep
Jj is big on hugs hey... also where was Kon????
JJ really needs to learn how to appreciate things, honestly. He's such a baby 👶
Greatest sidemen video ever
The ending was genuinely hilarious!!!! 2:58:03
Randys standup was so bad that it was good!
We need jj in more good team
Can we all give Kaspar a big round of applause
we need to see $200 v $20,000 in Australia this year sometime
Anyone else think that Toby be nice all the time it’s acc jarrin
How is it logical in jj mind that sleeping in a car that can’t keep warm is a better spot to slee then a cabin that has a wood buring furnace that can keep that whole cabin warm 😂
was legit convinced the German cigar chainsmoker was Theo Baker in character 🤣
Jesus loves y’all
harry sniffed the sock pahahaha
Just give my boy vik a good team experience
Not only teach JJ about gravity Vik, but also how to be a bit more appreciative and not a snob when ever he’s on the "bad team"
It’s my birthday in 2 days I’m a big ksi fan I watch all your videos love them could I get a like please
Hi
2:32:22 album cover
Tobi ksi always on the good team lol bit unfair innit
Cashpur being a pure vibe
A movie
3 hour long video is crazy
top 3 sidemen vids oat 💯
Simon like disappeared for a while
Good ending
WELL DONE! This is by far the greatest production to grace this channel. Shoutout to all the BTS staff who created this amazing bit of content! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
35:07 Their literally like 3 schoolgirls.
best sidemen sunday in years!
Josh really did Vik dirty!
The sleepover chat made me laugh more than I’ve laughed in a while 😂
1:11:46 simons face ??😭
The crew did a crazy job on 48:00 by handling the other envelope 😂🫡
Every time it’s a Josh video Vik never gets a good team. Kinda becoming obvious at this point.
Ah Jerk it out was sucha Fifa 04 throwback almost teared up from the nostalgia
Best movie I’ve ever watched
At first, it was good but near the end, Josh did the bad team dirty.
YAAA
Freezy always bringin the best vibes
"As a 31 year old", Ahhhhhhhhhhhh
Editors need a raise!!!! 🔥🔥
The hype this video had was worth it
Harry ruining the video being like that
best sidemen video oat
harry running across that bridge like a titan running for fresh meat goofy as hell...
13:49 jj and tobi breaking into singing linkin park with busta rhymes was not something i expected at all
The end was so good
Should’ve been better for 3hrs
Nah, if karma real, why Vik getting the bad team all the time? 🤣 He's such a sweet guy.
I love KSI getting humbled 😂😂😂😂
2:16:47 absolutely sent me 💀
i watched this video in episodes lmaooo
If harry stops drinking, sidemen have no purpose anymore 😢
1:53:00 Vikkstarfish
1:53:00 Vikk is a starfish
1:24:30 sidemen 100$ v 10000$ sleepover could bang tbf
2:16:48 what is this 😂😂😂
def the best sidemen vid to date
The more videos we get the more we begin to understand Vikks villain arc
Josh should really consider producing when this beautiful Sidemen journey is over. He makes the best videos. This might be the best Sidemen Sunday
Kashpur made the video for me! Some really wholesome moments between Harry and Josh, too!
Harry: Give them a kiss good night Vik Vik: does it Harry: that was a bit weird
imagine if when josh had them to choose a person to switch team, at then end the good team became the bad team. and the bad team became the good team. would have been the best twist. especially because JJ would have still been on the good team.
That sleep over is the meaning of bois made it
y did harry sniff the sock
Big up vik
amazing work and content from everyone 🥳
1:16:16 nah Harry sniffing the women sock is wild 💀
The JJ forehead cam as he climbed the wall was great lol
LOVED THIS
3 hours. Didn’t even think about it.  Very good video!
1:25:50 nah im dead😭
1:24:58 he’s a Belgian scoring genius, with the 24 inch p**** scoring all the goals bellend by his toes
if this doesnt take #1 viewed on channel ill be surprised and didn't see it on trending page crazy
the cinematography is so insaneeeeee
What kind of camera are they using on hour 2:24:33
2:42:13 sinc
🔥🔥🔥
Loved this longer video allot of great vibes and great views. Hope we get more longer videos in the future
Randolph is so unfunny
Too much vik the melt in this video. By too much I mean seeing/hearing him at all.
Honestly amazing video, loved that is was 3 hours of straight vibes
Imagine if they did a good vs bad holiday w all of their misses
Ladies And Gentleman it's a banger😌
chef zerkaa👨🏽‍🍳
3 Hour Sidemen Sunday 😍
Them hat torches are what I’m using to listen to this video 😂
ANOTHER.... BANGER BY ZERKAA
KSI so rude to the people on the bus
Where is that music from 1:25:30
3  hrs?
THE BOYS KNOCKED THIS OUT OF THE PARK. ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH THE ENDING. The sleepover and the Sunrise in the morning. Some of my FAVORITE sidemen moments.
dude what happened to JJ bros so soft now
Vik needs to be on the good team next time bro I swear😭
How could jj not say sisi wee Ethan literally set it up 😂😂😂
what a banger of a video
Only the Sidemen can release a 3 hour video and no one clicks off
I loved when nobody chose vick to join the good team. His just so cringe everytime he speaks or does anything. Very curious why his still their tho.
Did they just laugh at a guy for asking for a picture or am I just missing the joke?
I love Vik's energy in this video so much :(
What a banger of a vid guys.. love 👊
GOD BLESS
what a great video
vik has become my fav sidemen ngl man has glowed up from everywhere love the lad.
why would they go on a skiing holiday without doing at least some lessons first
2:29:30 lollll as much as Ethan points out the "audience" in the expensive holiday, we shouldn't forget that the cheap holiday crew is also a version of an audience. It's funny how they sidebois constantly try to extract intel from them, and how the crew often caves cause they're going thru the wringer on the cheap holiday as well.
that was a movie, shout to the editors man whata vid
Bro harry being so into that vid he spoke to it and being so confused when josh pulled him out of it was fkin hilarious
One of the best ever sidemen videos. Loved it. But need to treat vik better. He feels disrespected at the moment by the boys. Would be nice to see him more integrated with the videos
Bring back that german Guy
That POV of Harry running on the bridge had me in tears 😂😂😂
the production and editing for these videos get better and better
JJ is a hard watch in this, should of just been edited out ngl
Casper is goated.
Vik took this video over and I’m living and loving for it he shined ❤
That bridge video with the music was perfect
Missed opportunity to team up with the outdoors boys. Would have been great for the cheap team to go camping out in alaska with luke from ghe channel
3 hour sidemen Sunday 😭 lads what did we do to deserve this ❤thankyou
watch out for the sauna gollum
Ngl the best sidemen video  I think
3 hours??? 😳😳😳😳😲😲😲
Na this was epic. Next levels.
Honestly, a banging video, enjoyed every second of it. Had me laughing bad at some parts too!
14:17 The silence was so loud it that moment...
lol looks like mini ladd at 43:38
Ksi asking for a group hug was so wholesome
i bet the bad team teammates would spend like crazy after these challenges to feel that they're still rich 😂
JJ needs to actually be humbled ngl because he’s actually becoming so snobby and rude, calling the people on the bus “normal people” and just being so snobby all the time puts me off the videos tbh
Hard to say that any video is the best Sidemen video, but this is up there❤️❤️❤️ I’ve laughed so much
1:04.52 - the aggressive fist bump followed by security stepping was jokes.
42:13
Got team looking jacked 😂
it gives OG topgear roadtrips vibe
Kasper ( or Casper)  is good. But i was reaaaaaaaaaaally hoping for Phil for some reason xD.
The end😂😂
Zerkaa's laugh is evil
Justice for Vik
fatneek
imagine going on holiday just to get recorded with everything u do, i could never i acc rate u man for this💔
jj and ethan are like the autistic twins trying to contact the aliens
The last few minutes made me die of laughter😹
Casper was the best bit
1:14:42 should not have tried that 😭😭 his face had me dying
Return of the Fatneek?
This took me 3 sittings to watch because ive been busy but genuinely one of, if not, the best sidemen sundays ever. Felt like a movie, nice graphics and music, loved the little touches like the credits at the end. 10/10 🔥🔥🔥
New addition of Steve unlocked 2:17:22 - Skiing Steve
get a stabilizer ffs
JJ and Cashper are the funniest thing ever these videos make me genuinely laugh so much
Bruh JJ being on a normal bus, with normal people, going to a hostel saying he is "too rich for this". 😂
watching JJ actually just got annoying this video
Sidemen upgraded from YouTube videos to full on films
JUSTICE FOR VIK
I need to see another long talk mukbang
The fact Vikk didn't get even ONE vote is crazy!!!
14:04 had me CRYING
I know they're boys and all and it's probably played up for the video but am I the only one uncomfortable with how much Josh was pressuring Harry to drink when he said multiple times he didn't want to?
Mad how 10 years ago these guys were opening fifa packs in their parents houses and now they are producing 3 hour movies with a whole film crew. Absolutely mad
It's better to watch sidemen videos then any kind of movies , love it and enjoying it 🎉❤
2:12:50 best part of video that is so cool
Josh is a goat for being able to organize stuff like this on a weekly basis. It’s a certified banger when he plans a vid
It’s a movie🔥🌊
I don’t ever comment on these. I usually just watch. But man that was good
1:18:13 a bunch of 30 year old men btw lmao
Harry smelling the ladies sock is mad 😂😂
"we do a little snow powder in za day, we do little snowpowda in ze evening"  - dei muttar
1:46:21 looking like GTA characters
3 hours 😳
Josh is moving different nowadays! Never a let down and 3 hours is crazy! Can tell how much time, effort and heart went into making it
cashper is the goat bring him back again
This was a good vid Vic needs more love I’m them tho
This video is so sick
Amazing ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I was supposed to go skiing this year, but got cancer. Video was good though
2:16:40  I’m watching harry create a scene of Attack on Titan  😂😂
The best part was JJ greeting everyone he passed while skying with "bondjor"
40:35 why does the server look like bambino Becky
I feel like the holidays are rigged for Toby 😭
Why does the good team look like an oreo
We gotta see a return of Casper at some point bros hilarious 😂😂
This video just made me realise how fortunate I am to live in this country and get to experience this every winter
Everyone complaining about vick in the bad team its done by a wheel its random the game is the game
1:53:20 😂😂😂 that part JJ must keep warm was funny af
3hrs? This video will make like 2mil dollars lol😂
We need to find that picture
Banngggggerrrrrrrrrrr
I live here it's in the diablerets, my father works at the glacier 3000
is it me or does kasper look like Owen Wilson
2:16:41 the funniest scene ever 😂😂😂😂😂
Petition for casper to be the 8th sideman
All Vik did was whinge all the way through proper whingefest
Ksi is barely on the bad team ever he always get the best
the main thing i took from this video is that in randys world, jesus talks like michael jackson
J’habite là bas 🤩
I think this has become my favourite sidemen vid of all time
40:19
The comedic timing of whatever hit Ethan in the Eye at 2:21:59 , man been a while since I laughed that hard
THEIR BETTER BE A MOVIE FOR EVERY SEASON DAMN IT!!!!
I swear vik is so rich. Hes complaining about a cabin thats not even that bad
This is definitely one of those ones where the bad team is lowkey the good team 😂
3 hours is a stretch, highly unlikely I watch the whole thing!
JJ saying " I'm too rich for this " killed me
That guy was gonna punch Simon in the face
Is it just me that would love either team im on, they are both really nice experiences
1:14:46 COOCHIE POV 😂
harry smelling the sock is crazy LMAO
Pewdiepie gives me Michael jackson vibes
Absolute banger of a video omg
Banger
W intro
Still waiting for the episode where the big twist is that both teams are the good/expensive team. 😅
Josh again with another Banger. The man is unstoppable.
Cooked
Damn, my boy Josh got the lads overthinking everything at the start, lmaooo
3 hours...
Vik deserves the good team bro... for like the next 5 videos at least...
#stopVikabuse
I love Casper 😂
1:03:03 Tobi should compete in those 'Tag' competitions
u can see the baby face when ethan is wobbling jelly and u see her face
Why is JJ never on the bad team😂
get kasper on again pls
loved this video so much!!!!
I love the part where the good team was eating, and they said "big up nick" and nick looked SO happy about it like it was the best moment of his life 😭
should have just released this instead on netflix instead of the doc Great Vid
Dope intro
Remove KSI from sidemen! 🎉
2:16:44 bruh I thought I was watching the sidemen, next thing I know the titans, from attack on titan, pull up!🤣
Jj getting big again😭😭
sick vid
aight bet
honestly this is the best sidmen sunday ending ever
Is no one talking about Harry smelling the sock and putting it in his pocket 😂
@36.39 mini watch out for that sniper bro!!
Damn JJ is so grumpy
Music was on point in this video 👌
well that's dissapointing... JJs arrogance and ego is fed again...
THAT COLDPLAY CINEMATIC SCENE WAS SICKK
This is probably the best Sidemen Sunday of all time, and that’s saying something.
JJ screaming “let me off im too rich for this!” While theres just other people on the bus is hilarious
THAT IS THE SAME SKI RESORT I WENT TO
I hope they will have a $20,000 vs $200 in Japan or something similar.  Really enjoy these longer sidemen Sundays. keep up the great content
looool ksi CHILL out bro, if u die u die 2:07:10
There’s need to be cheap vs expensive vs Casper the goat
just goes to show we need more troops in sidemen sundays.
This was a BANGERRR
One of the best videos
``lmao``
Class video boys! I actually think this is one of my favourites!
JJ switched from Lightweight class to heavyweight
Harry running over the bridge killed me off 😂😂 2:16:40
1:25:16
They are being driven like they are presidents or kings   like  what : 17:37
The ending was actually a banger.
KSI gained so much weight
Where is this
Why is the funniest part of the entire video at 2:58:02
Nah I feel sorry for Vik man 😔
lol sidecucks dropping another trash video
1:04:55 was that guy about to rock miniminter? 😂 the bodyguard stepping up lol
bro how is that a "bad" team? that thing probably cost like 2000 dollars a night
jj made this amazing video such a hard watch….
2:16:40 FUNNIEST MOMENT EVER 😂😂😂😂
2:58:17 i love everyone’s laughs😭
Amazing video
The poor camera people trying so hard to stall until The Boys™️ arrive
Gotta love cashper
Honestly everyone person they get for each team. Josh probably says like “bug jj as much as possible”
The end was peak for Vik, they were just laughing in this face. Randolph got done dirty too, probably got bullied into doing that stand up
Nigeria team Ethan 1% nigeria
Lactose intolerant JJ smacking back pounds of cheese
Fantastic video, loved the credits at the end giving everyone who was part of making this their props. Hopefully it's something added to more videos.
Harry taking a video in middle of night of someone snoring was way tooo funny 🤣🤣
Casper is fckin jokes 😹
Why did Josh say Tobi had deciding vote 1:33:33? It was one vote each for Simon and Harry, how did he know Tobi wouldn’t vote Vik and tie it 😂
Best sidemen vid
Absolutely blown away. What a madness of a video.
we just need a pure sleepover vid :(
This was amazing. Long live Caspur
After 1:05:03 during the cut they explained what a facial was to jj
JJ needs permanent bad team I’m sorry😭 blokes ego is crazy
why they split the three Nigerians 🥲
"no i'm still shooting"
Why do I think we are going to here faith  saying something about that show 😂 can’t wait
W vid
CASHPER THE GOAT
Casper is such a g
Imagine paying your hard earned money on a skiing trip and some random Brit is just there screaming how bad it is.
Justice for Vik
1:51:50....when harry watches how to ski ...bruv was flabbergasted when josh started talking to him
5 mil in 1 day? This vid is GOING PLACES
#chubski
I think I couldn’t have it better. 1 am, hot ramen and a 3 hour sidemen Sunday.
are nobody gonna talk about that clean catch 40:25
Bro JOSH IS THE GOAT DGAS WHAT PPL SAY 3 HOURS MAKES IT EVEN BETTER  I LOVE JOSH❤❤
Tobi is getting treted in the past two videos, first a legwax now the facial
Hard watch with JJ complaining.
40:27 the way jj casually did a no look catch😂
This video showed me again why Vikkstar is one of my favourite people on YouTube. His spirit throught this video was amazing, always kind, always active. He just such a joy to watch and very good entertainer.
Edon barevuma
Love ksi but he got fatter😢@Sidemen @KSI
WHERE DID SIMONS TEAM GET THEIR SUITS FROM???!! I’m gonna buy some
Best 3 hours
It’s funny too me that ksi personality, volume, and whining is the main reason I rarely watch the sideman videos. I rarely ever watch them all the way through.
I‘m other people are doing this so I don’t have to.
25:13 was cold 😂
11:10
Vikkstar moaning about there being no content, but when content arrives, he goes outside and shuts it down immediately.   Atleast KSI tried to go along with it to begin with.
why don't love VIK?..
god I love vik’s positivity on the bad team it always creates a great dynamic, BUT please let this man be on the good team.
what a video like a movie fr keep it up ❤
Tobi is always lucky eh
Josh burned through the budget for this shoot 🔥🔥
The reason why JJ gets the good team because he is the leader of the sidemen and Tobi is nice so both of them will always get the good team , the reason why vik gets the bad team is because he is too nice and don’t Complain much so they take advantage of him
that randolph comedy was the funniest thing LMAO
3 hour video idk what i did to deserve this but it’s gonna take me days to watch😍😍😍xx
Feel bad for vik trying to make fun content with simon and JJ is jarring
bro sniffed the sock 1:16:20
That was one of the best Sidemen sundays I've watched for 3 years now.
Love the sideboys
Harry’s double look is definitely a great face
I really enjoyed this
3 hours
nah I know it's exaggerated for the video but poor lad at 9:25 just getting laughed at in his faced and called an NPC
this was by far the best sidemen sunday ever
1:55:38 Bro said so last season lmao...
VikkStar The Goat 😊
1:16:19 bro gave it a whiff 😭
might be one of the best sidemen videos. please keep doing videos like this
Alright. Getting them premium music licenses. 🙌🙌Big up the sidemen.
HE SMELT THE SOCK
1:11 20 secs Harry has no chill
Harry smelling the sock is gold
HARRY SMELLED THE SOCK HAHAHAH
Awesome Video
Why did Harry sniff the sock 💀💀💀
Ethan was jokes this video
Josh with another absolute banger he is the goat. Plus vik needs a good team soon poor vik
this movie was better than madame webb
The absolute dream holiday
The production, the length, the amount of work that went into this is amazing what a great video keep it up boys
Ayyyyyoooooo 1:16:18 Harry's on a mad one I swear aswell as vik saying an all day skiing sock 🤢😂😂
Production quality is crazy
The credits at the end sent me. Legit Sidemen Movie 2 😂
02:16:42😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Why
We're really at the point where their bad team is a pretty nice holiday for normal people
1:10:20 JJ still fluent in french
Why isn’t Simon with vik and jj on the mountains?
50:20
Omg  36.00 onwards look for the green dot on minter head snippers in the woods 😂😂 .......run
1:12:30 *Harry beats 10 year old in rock paper scissors* Harry - “Yeah have that mate” 😭😭
Zerka has to make this right
Ngl the best part of this video was the last 15 minutes S/O to the troops
Worst video ever seen
Brilliant vid! Really enjoyed this. Music and editing was on point!!!
Some people in these comments are such boring haters, can't understand content 🙄😂
JJ be complaining no matter what team he's on lmaoo
Top tier 👏🏻
Sidemen sunday beginning to look like an actual film is such a banger!
Harry sunburnt from the Maldives? xD
Nah I can’t lie, they need to vote Vik fr for things like this, I felt for him not getting picked and had to keep a huge smile throughout the voting session which was peak. As much as I love the sidemen, they should lowkey do better 😢 #justiceforvik
another holiday video? I really will watch whatever these boys post. It's past the point of being a choice i swear I have watched these geezas travel to every country on the planet
who is keith
I KNOW THE GUY FOR THE JOKE CHALLENGE HE WENT TO MY SCHOOL!!!!!!!!
W ending.
Well now we’re going to need a summer one Josh 😅
Ngl @ 2:51:25 reminds me of my garage parties with just my boys. Sitting around, talking, drinking, and lil music and all round good vibes. I miss those times man.
Loved the outro seemed like a real movie
Josh does these vids perfect tbh and 3 hours the longer the better
I want vik to be in good team 😢
This professional af
Crazy tobi broguht 3 gyal to the good team night 2
This was I think the best sidemen video ever
Crazy video. Felt like a movie
It’s funny that vik and Ethan are cursed in these types of videos
Tobi's so fast... 😂
We need ksi to host another 100 vs 100,000 or 7 star vs 1 star video again because that was fun.
this is going down as one of the greatest sidemen sundays
loved the ending credits and cinematic view
idk how i can sit here and watch a YouTube video for 3 hours in one sitting but not a movie thats 1,5h
That intro was SICK
The end was legendary❤
Ksi way too rude with the fans at the start. Made me leave the vid
JJ turns into a baby on the bad teams
That was an amazing video guys! Loved that it was a feature length video as well! Watched it in parts through the day and really enjoyed it! Please do more feature length videos going forward 🙏
I’m confused. How are they able to use copyrighted music?
I hope Kasper got paid more than $200 for this. Need more Kasper
Need another harry hosted one, ive never laughed as hard as seeing JJ and Toby with the deep heat  JJ funny as ever, would like to see Simon, Harry and Vik on good team next though, they seem to get shafted frequently
the guy in yellow jacket I love him..
NAH, ain't no way harry sniffed that sock sneakily
JJ at the bad team😂😂😂😂
The final part was so funny bro 😂
Man the things I'd do to be in a sidemen video
😮😮😮
Im not gonna lie the bad team isnt even THAT bad. The guys on the bad team doing too much
Harry sniffed that sock 😭🤣🤣
Casper is too hilarious 😂😂
The camera quality is insane
the longer the vid the better
the best sidemen video i have seen<Best video i have seen in my life. Respect to the suffering.
The production of this video was insaneeeeeeee, absolutely smashed itt!!!🥶🥶🥶
no comment 1:16:19
Jj on the bus it’s just disgusting, the fact people actually pay to do that and hes making a mockery out of them? Money clearly changes people 🥱
Vik is my fave ❤
'The 2nd day mountain part ' , i just saw a beautiful dream , i got tears 🥹
Josh is literally an alcoholic
5:23 I'm Dying 🤣🤣🤣
Stop giving away which team is good and which is bad in the thumbnail
Ethan go back brunette lad
Next time put Vik Tobi and harry together they deserve to get the good team they are always so grateful and wholesome
still kinda disorientating to hear copyrighted music on these vids i know they make bank and all but I wonder how much they have to pay for 30 seconds of paradise by coldplay
3 hours is insane
The German guy carried so hard the bad team
Fatneek is back
is ksi bulking? wtf is that belly
I haven’t commented on a video in over 5 years, but this one deserves it. The content in this video is absolutely legendary, big ups to the boys and the crew behind this one. I really enjoyed this one
The quality in this vid was subliminal ❤❤ to be fair though
1:25:52 That was one of the best things simon has ever done too...
We just gonna ignore harry sniffin the sock at 1:16:20 😭
What other videos is Casper in
1:24:50 I would sleep there happily blud...
The room Montague had me in a choke hole
Vic is my favorite sidemen
One of the best sidemen videos ever❤
Im re watching this video and the sound track BANGS
Sidemen Cooked 👨‍🍳
Ooo Za big boy 😂
Why the hell is Ethan always on the good team?????
Best bit is KSI on the bus 🚍 lol😅 I never laughed so much 😅
nah what was 2:16:40
JJ screaming on that zip line had me dying 😂
2:42:41 bruv 😭
1:36:40 vik getting put in a compilation with this one for sure
side men the only people who can pump out movies weekly and they still be entertaining!!!
Make a 20000 beach holiday with water skiing and then a 200 beach holiday
Loved it all but the ending gave me goosebumps like it was a movie
I swear I saw Tobi drink alcohol
2:58:10 This is my favourite moment from the video 😭
Big ups nick
Elite video, truly 🔥🔥🔥
1:18:26 I think that's the best thing i've ever seen Ethan do
nothing to see here, just some grown men enjoying a swing.
BEST SIDEMEN SUNDAY VIDEO EVER
Imagine being on a bus with ksi 🫠
Viks the best

does anyone know what the villa is actually called?
Like this coment if u love the sidemen
jj looks like he’s bulking again 😂
we used to cope with life's stress with an hour long video and it was enough,  duuude life's great with a 3 hour one, almost forgot abt my misreable life after watching this banger. nothin but love
Kasper is the goat
1:17:46 is set 8 maths class
Harry smelling her sock 😂
Vik is the most genuine of all and they don’t respect him enough🤕
This is so entartaining
bro they all have the same hairstyles out there 😂

production of this video is incredible
HARRY 🤣🤣 1:16:18
1:14:50 LMAO
I got a video idea spend 100k on ur security team
Loved Vik here 🌼🤌🏼🤌🏼
Basically a movie, production was top tier. Best lunch/dinner ever
God I absolutely love this group 😂❤️
I want to see more 3 hour videos, I enjoy watching them
1:15:51 them people nearly died
One of the best videos ever and edits and music's and the visual 😍 🔥🔥
KSIs coach, NPC freakout was genuinely embarrassing to watch, wont ever approach him if I ever see him in public. And I've watched him for 12 years.
2:16:40  Thought I was watching attack on Titan for a minute there
hopefully those people in the alpine tour were actors
It's weird that Ethan and Josh doesn't like vik. Vik's a great guy and i really like simon and vik relationship in this video 😊❤. Vik and tobey are really kind.
JJ rock climbing camera angle had me dead🤣🤣🤣🤣
2 hours 40 mins in knew we’d get some sort of nut material get in
Massive madness.
There's something about this editing and scene that really seem like I'm watching a movie
6 min in and I know this gonna be a banger. JJ on the bus hilarious.
Didn't want it to end😞.
Security stepping in at 1:04:00 😂
whole some post credit scene 🥹
2:26:15 VIK HAD ME ROLLING
Quality man on everything ❤️🙌🏻
Ngl the ending with the sleepover made me laugh the hardest, such childish joy from these lads caught on camera 😭
a 3 hour sidemen sunday should be 3 hours every week. it was wonderful i didnt have to procrastinate on what to watch for ages
BANGER
2:54 hits too hard and too close home man :( that ending was a masterpiece
Ksi killing me when he's dirty talking on the food nooo way 😂😂😂😂
hearing KSI say my surname is very weird
Dude the house edit went hard
This was a great video, best of the year 🏆
3 Hour Sideman Sunday! It must be a banger!!!
56:48 bro didnt even hesitate lmao
Please tell me who this Casper guy is and does he have a Ytube channel? I need more of this guy 😂🤣
Callux ruined the video
What does stacking strain up mean
Best sidemen sunday
Credits were cold
3 hrs of such an awesome sidemen video is all u need...mm just a mention ... Vikkk was having so much fun while skiing and witha ll the frnds and was positive till the very end....kuddos to him and the entire sidemen ❤
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
With this music it looks like a movie
Romans 10:9-11  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.
ksi should get the bad team more often ...... the others are more humble when they get it
Harry sniffed the sock 🤔🤔🤔
where is it the good team stayed????
40:28 cleanest catch by jj
I swear jj is getting unbearable. Just pure arrogance every time like come on be human for a minute. Stop acting like youre over everyone and everything. Very sad used to love him…
legit a movie
Whats the hotel name where ksi and team stayed!?
When I checked in, it said three hours I instantly ordered food and I’m ready
The midnight sleepover convo with everyone pissing themselves is every boys sleepover back in the day
the last part with the boys was so funny
JOSH COOKED 🔥🔥
Throughout the tears, JJ has become boring and more arrogant. He doesn’t wanna leave his luxury and comfort zone and keeps roasting people and calling them beneath him. It’s sad to see his downfall.
Nah man what harry did in 1:16:19 is pure filth 🤮
Josh absolutely smashes these videos. The bad teams need to liven up more tho boring b*******😂
josh with a W as always
The shot of Harry running across the bridge is meme worthy 😂😂😂
Kaspar kills me, great guest
Genuinely felt sorry for vik when he got no votes :(
casper is hilarious
1:18:39 I'm going paper alright was too cold
Why does ksi even bother showing up if he's gonna act like that? This video would be a banger without ksi
This was a mad vidéo ❤
Vikk 3x good team next time 🙌🏻♥️
yet again the cheap team have a better time, meeting strangers, drinking, doing daft things.
3hr crazzzy
sidemen back with another bange, one of the best 3h i have spent
01:20:00  harry was terrified 😂
When I said I wouldve liked longer videos I didn'y expect 3 hours long!! This is HUGEEEEE
Should’ve been vik, Harry just plain out… ehh lol
1:00:05 I love the angles
Fricken 3 hours 😳😳
Best video in a while, certified banger
Casper is funny asf
We need troops in video
Why does ksi always complain?  Cant watch the video that mans childish behaviour
Harry: Give them a kiss good night Vik Vik: *does it* Harry: that was a bit weird  😂😂😂😂
this is the future of sidemen videos. long, feature length adventures. in 5 years time, we might only get one a month or so, but they'll be bangers every time.
It's a shame jj wasn't there for his song being used 😂
Hahaha gotta love the ski instructor just dealing with jj. 😂
2:16:42  TITAN SPOTTED
hold my beer, fatneek is back!!
01:47:15 w2s strikes again
What’s with the proper music in this vid must’ve bought the rights to them all
The loud snore and Harry's face after that was hilarious 😂😂
3hours wtf lets go my boys
Jj always ruins the videos with his negativity
ksi fell off
The good team texting about how great they’ve got it yet they’re all on their phones looking bored/miserable
1:07:20 the way i know for a fact that's a dutch guy lmao
1:16:19 bro just took a whiff…
What I don't understand is how does JJ never end up on the bad team idk seams fishy
The outro credits were an amazing touch🙌🏻
Vikks the goat
I’m so disappointed no one done the halo theme tune In that sauna 😂
1:16:16 harry sniffed the sock wtf
I think Ethan was smiling and  laughing this whole time good for him c:
Meal is all set let’s get it🔥
Sidemen cooked this video, the fact they playing Coldplay in videos these days shows how clear sidemen are 😭
i feel bad for vik next time he should be in the good team please i beg hes so adorable
Feel bad for the random people having to listen to jj screaming on a public bus
The quality of the video is amazing
The danes there, are some hhx losers ong
KSI…….
W vid
I can get behind the no Vik votes. Very understandable. I don’t think anyone in human history would vote for Vik to join them on their trip. 😌🤣
Cant bother watching 3 hours of Sidemen
Would’ve been a lot more fun and challenging if they did the actual route on the climbing wall
Sad vikkstar
Incredible
2:11:19
1:04:10 harry and josh got closer after the maldeves video
probably the funniest sidemen Sunday so far
$200 holiday > $20,000 holiday
man poor vik, next time him and simon need to be on the good team
enjoyed 3h of sidemen 100 times more than a 2h movie,,, honestly need this once every month, I’m loving this 🫡🫡
This was so good
This was the best holiday in a long time!
is the ski instructor smoking a regular cigar or a blunt? respect if bro is just tryna get faded while linking with the sidemen 😭😭😭.
when vik played rock, paper,scissors with that woman and claimed he was world champion, vik looked so much taller than the woman. The guy in the backround was much taller than vik though.
Vik is the MVP of this video he single-handedly carried the video and the cheap team
Movie Production man, Sidemen on TOP now and forever!
Video idea. Do a vid where both teams r the bad team but they think the other team is the good team
FATNEEK IS BACKKK
It's funny how Josh is trying so hard to bribe Harry into drinking lmao 😂
One of the best sidemen holiday videos??
2:16:50 the final titan erin sees before being attacked
Took me 2 days to watch this man 🤣
Nice to make a feature 1 hour 8 mins
the last moments of the cheap team was the best part of the video
Make these vids shorter my batterie dies😢
i felt quite quite bad for the guy in the beginning who wanted a photo right before 9:38 … jj was kinda disrespectful to him honestly
Poor vik was becoming delusional
Who was the bad teams instructor
Poor Vik man! I feel his pain
One word... Classic
Dam when did JJ become boring and the least interesting part of the video...
JJ kinda losing shape
not the couple nearly getting run over in the background at 1:15:48
what a vid!!!!!
love how Viks mood just changed from 0 - 100 in the end when the boys arrived
14:04 had me dead 😭
What Simon said about josh there at 47:30 was so facts tho
I really didn't want the Swap to happen, JJ suffered last time, nah the swap was cruel. 😅
bog sniffing the sock at 1:16:17 is criminal 🤣
idk man, but JJ just constantly CONSTANTLY crying is insane, it gets just annoying
i swear none of the sidemen like vik lol😭
whoever said "lets spice the edit up" it definitly worked!
I feel like the sound production has gone up because more music has been playing and stuff like that
1:16:19 why did Harry smell the sock....
Tobias outfit matches the couch next to the slide 😂
2:16:40 straight out of a nightmare oml 💀💀
I just feel bad for Vik my bro no one voted for him
2hr 16mins I thought harry running was cal freezy 😂
9:20 I hated JJ for saying look at the phone he’s got , not every body is rich I wish he would learn
1:16:18 caught iin 4K taking a wiff LMAO
i thought during the voting, that person would remain on the team, and the other 2 would swap team
The best ever sidemen ending
Love from india thankyou sdmn
They should do an abandoned challenge in a non English speaking country
This was one of the best sidemen videos I’ve seen it was incredible content it was never dull and it was HILARIOUS
1:17:23
JJ looking like trippy red right now lol
Vik is a king, i used to like JJ but now he's just so annoying. probably the worst sideman imo
The ending 😂😂
The bad team after 2:50:00 is probably the most wholesome moments
1:14:38 imagine thats your dad
Why did the intro cook so hard
The fact that these guys can post movie length content like every other week is wild
Looked like clowns with that outfits on
Gotta Love that Steve is the green Power Ranger 😂❤
JJ looks like gain a lot
They should do a video where just Tobi and Vik are on a luxury vacation, and the others are camping in the woods
Ksi needs to be humbled
What a video 🔥🔥
I also would love to see the troops in a video where they do a survival video and actually try with challenges
The switch Was CRAZYYY 😂😂😂
This ain’t no youtube video, this a Movie😭
Actually loved this!
Paradise Song to Paralysed JJ
Ngl that sleep over was the best thing to happen all video that an jj falling 😂😂
Spoiler Blocker ❌
BIG FKN VIDEO
the best part of this video is when it goes pitch black at the end with all boys laughing at the sleepover what a time laughing at bullshit but with the boys!
one of the best videos respect josh
That was literally a movie. VIK carried this video.
Harry’s roller coaster ride of emotions best part of any video ever 😂 he already wants to be done with making videos with sidemen just want to live his life without a camera and challenges
One of the best sideman videos oat😤🤞
the tradition of the bad team having more memorable experiences continues!
I love tobi
4:32 ‘bro there’s like normal people on there’
it would be funny if they did this but both teams were the bad team 😂
Sick
That McJaegger joke was 😅
that ending was wholesome af!
Intro goes hard props to whoever made that
I am striving to finish 30mins left
HARRY SNIFFING THE SOCK IS CRAZY😭😭
Best video the sidemen have made
Wow, best video till date❤
Damn this is a literal movie big up the sidemen and production crew
The Sidemen have made jaw-dropping vids, but this... this is a cinematic masterpiece. The editors killed it as well.
bro SIDEBOYS made a better wayyy better Youtube content then Youtube themselves. PS, Throwback to Youtube Originals: Sidemen Show
Justice for vik😭
I think I'd have liked the cheap holiday more tbh
2:13:26 was pure comedy 😂😂😂😂
1:22:38 - second from the left - Żubrówka Vodka? Didn't know they exported it...
is it just me or does anyone else feel like vikk is always being kinda left out of the group... only harry , tobi take care of the man .... yet he tries his level best to make the video good.
The production on this is actually crazy good
❤
I’m so busy nowadays that I might just be able to watch all the 3 hours of this before next sidemen Sunday 🤦🏻‍♂️
Harry's attack on titan view over the bridge was amazing
ksi is genuinely violating on the coach its peak
The fact the Ethan said migros and turn around quickly had me dying😂😂
Vik is gonna remember this one
Harry dosent want to drink HE DOSENT HAVE TO DRINK
20:38 / 3:00:57
2:58:08 this ending was gold
BRO I WAS AT MORZINE I WAS THERE 😮😮❤
This was hard to watch at times...Poor Vik, he really got the sh*t end of the stick. I wouldn't have been able to be so positive after all the Ls. Besides that, JJ's tantrum almost ruined the video for me but Harry running across the bridge saved it 😂
Don’t understand how GOOD is video is! Longer videos, insane production, music, editing. Seriously 2024 is sidemen’s year
2:16:00 anyone got the track id?
Jjs 5head climbing pov took me out
finally jj got some justice
My now fav sidemen video of all time 💜
Bro editing is off the charts, really digging the new style
best sidemen vid of all time ?!!!!
The instructor calling Vik “Vicky” had me dying 😂
Love these vids man josh always kills it
What a Banger video, Everyone killed it Crew and Troops 3hrs of non stop comedy and friendship is crazy. We need more videos like this, Also get the video to 1M Likes
Ngl Josh videos always go hard! I seriously didn't even notice this was 3 hours long
3 hours wtfff,
Why us the winter holiday video happening in the spring??????????????
Now THIS IS A SIDEMEN SUNDAY !!!!!!!!
Casper's the Scandinavian Phil
why did harry smell the sock
last 5 min of the vid elitee
@25:38 lol the fact he swapped Vik and Tobi last minute makes it even worse
We want KSI in good team
I cant believe its 3hrs thanks to the sidemen your ending my day with a smile
Ksi screaming in the bus I'd actually throw summing
1:06:00
Amazing video
My god the edit was different this time
this was a whole movie  and the ending was 🔥🔥🔥
Did y’all catch security guard step in at 1:04
Tell me how they would have got flights and accomodation for 200? 😂😂
Sidemen best video of the year
Ethan thinking he can cook with the snowboard is crazy
josh cooooooked
That needs to be the ending to every sidemen sunday shows how much work they put into the videos from bts etc. loved it
3 hours lets goooo!
Harry and Ethan aqua aerobics was actually good😂 that backflip off the shoulders was a 10
YESSS THIS I AMAZING
The journeys at the beginning are one of the hilarious ever😂😂
Why bully vikk u should be on the good team for once
Bro the music choices in this video are sublime
1.45.56 cracked me up so hard XDDD
Jj on the bus at the beginning is just crazy hilarious 😂😂
vik's a bit awkward
This is like a whole movie with all the intro, title, the drama, ups and downs, wholesome ending, the credits. Damn I love the Sidemen.
1:56:26 “come to me vijayjay”  😂
Amazing video as always @zerkaa and at not point in this video did i think it was dragging or was boring, i watch every second invested in it all.
Dahmmm, they broke the 3 hour mark
Vik and JJ on the same team never fails 😂
Damn it's a movie
day 2 was such a micro aggression.
I can't be the only one who thinks tobi piped the messause
2:06:38 The view of KSI's mouth though  👀
One of the Best sidemen video ever, definitely the best one this year, Zerkaa, well done mate.
The fact that I could've watched a whole Lord of the Rings but chose this instead...
The last few bits after Randy said the thing about they remembering when they are old made the video! Everything before that was so boring! lol!
It was a good video dare I say; a good length satisfying movie!
Top 3 that is 🤣
1:16:19 why did he smell it 😂
Does anyone know what suits vik, simon and harry were wearing?
Tbjzl has the most appreciative and pure soul ever, that man needs to be protected at all costs❤️. Also Ethan's atheletic ability is top tier ✨
3 hours goes crazy
The production on this is insane
elite
3 HOURS LONG VID?! OH MY GOD I HAVE BEEN GONE FOR THE WEEKEND AND MY MONDAY IS THE BEST
2:16:43 reminds me of the titans running in AOT
JJ needs to work on his moods 🤣🤣
Vik done dirty man peak
Banger
This editing style is way better get rid of short loud content >>>> goats
2:16:42 WTF THIS HAS ME DEAD😭
vik was such a ray of positivity this video, hoping he gets on the good team in the future he deserves it, love him but JJ needs to be humbled at times haha
John opposite them😂😂😂😂
1:11:20
love this
damn, 3 hours ? we watchin movies at this point. (love it)
I would enjoy a video of them all on a banger holiday as a group
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
2:25:10 This moment had me DYING😂😂😂
casper was quality
Went to Glacier 3000 in December it’s such a surreal place, the bridge walk is unreal! 100% would recommend everyone sees it once
When its Josh,vik,toby,harry ethan,or Simon they always have compassion at the end for the bad team,but when its jj they will go thru hell n back from start to finish till the very end😂😂😂😂,but best sundays are when they do the cheap vs expensive
What is jj complaining for while skiing the good team is doing the exact same thing but up higher and colder 😂
I loved this so much best one so far the long ones are the best (pause)
That ending was beautiful
Watching Ethan and JJ do them noises n stuff to Tobi while stoned was so damn wierd
Without a doubt the BEST produced Sideman Sunday of all time. Insane they put out a new video every week along with everything else they have going on. Hats off to use 👌🏼
2:12:57 music hit like crazy
Twas a good one
#wewantjusticeforvik
2:12:41 is the best thing I've ever seen!! The music and the drone shots! OH MY GOD!
Vik and Tobi seem like genuinely good guys
Man, this was a full on film
Awesome Video!
Nahh KSI back to fatneek again
Wtf at 2:16:42 😂
I always catch up on youtube on a monday night!! 3 hours, it's a one video monday
THEY HAVE OUT DONE THEMSELVES!!! THIS IS LEVELS  OHMYGOD  THE MUSIC AND THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨
tobi sliding on his face killed me
This videos make 2024 relevant !!
Great vid until harry was on the bad team
I love vikk
I love Cashpur, he truely embodies all of Germany
Just don’t understand why it’s 3 hours, thats like 2 maybe 3 weeks of sidemen Sundays there. 3 hours boys! Moving like Marvel.
KSI has gotten fat again 1:08:17
24:30 “helicopter helicopter”
JJ has become so out of touch with reality
We definitely need more like this, this was absolutely amazing
The production value on this video is insane
We need a double bluff holiday where both teams are bad teams but they can’t contact each other to find out about it
Amazing video. Well done Josh
Finally a good holiday vid
did harry sniff the sock?
Proud to be dutch during this video
This was amazing!!! really creative video to all involved
KSI is fat again
Ayo what is Tobi wearing 😂😂😂
amazing
fun!
How did that man in his 50s/60s not know how to play rock paper scissors
2:16:40 the sudden cut to Harry doing, ummm i dont even know what he is doing. Just harry things i guess
Nigerian punished?
2:16:37 Harry running like he's an AOT titan
bro that sleepover was what they needed to forget about the bad things
Man called him vejayjay 😂😂
Harry runing on the bridge is the best ever
One of the best Sidemen Sunday's. The quality and production was incredible. 2024 has been a banger of a year for the boys!
Harry deserved that such a honest guy best swap deal come on who agrees he turns bad things into good things.
35:41 funniest😂😂
JJ ain’t build for this snow stuff 🤣🤣🤣
The intro and ending on this video slapped so hard it was brilliant video definitely more 3 hour videos let josh contine to do these videos
People say when JJ leaves it will be the end of the sidemen. When in reality when he leaves it’ll be the soooo much better viewing
its a small detail but its crazy they had the camera man take ski lessons before filming. Thats elite.
Them laughing about the NPC's on the bus while they have Tobi in their group 😂
Tobi's giggling is the cutest thing I've ever heard
Fire content.
30:57 The boys are kenough.
wow Josh! well done👏👏👏👏👏👏
Sick Video boyssss!! Killing itt!🔥🔥🔥
1:16:19 harry caught in 4K 💀💀💀
Vik such a nice guy...
JJ put on his comfort weight I see 1:08:22 must be all the slutty lettuce. genuinely though, great vid! Only the sidemen can have me watch a video of 7 dudes messing around for the length of a LOTR film
cheap team >>>>
Jj face cam when he climbed the wall killed me 😂
the bad team outfits were so sick
The ending was soooo wholesome!
mfs put out a goddamn movie.. wtf is up with the length?!! Not complaining tho
JJ thinking that fan was a NPC had my dying fr😂😂😂
Poll for Cashper to become the newest member of the Sidemen 🙏😂
Why did harry sniff the sock 😂
it would be cold if on one of those decisions/votes to change he flipped whatever they had wanted. so JJ would have gotten good team because of all the votes and harry would've been first bad. least votes for both are the ones who swap. the faces would be priceless.
justice for vikkstar
2:16:42 I’m crying 😂😂😂
ksi’s ego is too big
THE BOYS AT NIGHT GET CRAZY!
My Boy VIKSTAARRR DOESNT NEED A GOOD TEAM HE RICH ENOUGH TO BE IN AGOOD TEAMLIFE
Loved how they put credits at the end of this one. I know we know the boys and the main team like John and Kon but it's good to see others credited.
This was a beautiful creation❤
Gotta love seeing KSI suffer. I kinda want a video where everyone is on the good team and JJ on his own being bullied
The amount of money that went into the making of the video on top of all the licensed music, dayum this is a big budget video🔥
Why does Viks outfit look like a feastables bar  😂
Can’t believe Harry sniffed that woman’s sock😂😂😂😂
I actually loved the ending of this one
Great video, loved the end credits
1:50:18 bro could not pick ksi up 😂
10/10 greastes sidemen vid. Beautiful production scenes and everything🎉
The last 5 minutes of this video😮‍💨😫👌🤌 movie masterpiece quality and fun
I alt + tabbed at 43:45 and heard some crazy stuff
guys jj's got fat again yay!
25$40cents
95% of people who watch sidemen couldn’t even afford the cheap holiday and these c*nt’s are moaning about it. Privileged or what 😂
Cashpur actual a great improv with all the boys
I dont like that KSI, Ethan and Tobi laughed at the guy for asking for a picture. It was quite rude and theyre the reason they have the money they have
love me a 3hr sidemen sunday.....letsss goo
21:10 they should’ve put that Harry take a hike clip🤣
Sidemen on top🔥🔥🔥
That’s Steve from @skicoachingonline at 1:51:45!!
vik is sucha sweetie
The sleepover at the end reminded me of my childhood sleepovers🥲
This video was top tier
Ethan’s ARC is mental, dad core
Was it just me or did everyone else like the bed content the most too? 😂
Ksi looks like the predator at 33:54
1:38:00
1:16:19 why did he sniff it
1:43:32 cmon vikky 😭
2:19:52 best part
Harry: “ I’ve never gone down on a ski lift before”…I’m just wondering Is that going to be on Side+ cause must of been edited out 🧐
this is like a movie, i luv it
Bro said 3 hours this is longer then a film let's go
“Idk what luxury in Europe feels like” says a millionaire that lives in Europe
Anyone else feels like "SIDEMEN AIRLINES" should have been "SIDELINES"?
Harry being delusional about the team swap😂
damn thats crazy how i am get post movie depression vibes right now , BigsUps to them for making such a great vid , tbh i wanted more
3:00:00??!!!!! BLOOOOODYYY
Was JJ’s word of the day micro aggression or sum😭
bro all them sleeping together is soo nice bro
33.36 word of the day
Yo how does Vik get ZERO votes to join the good team? Y'all are wrong...
Took me two days to finish this vid , fireeeeee mates 🫰🏽🫰🏽🫰🏽
The use of copyright music is what the videos have bin missing 👌🏻
I cant lie i was just skipping through the rich team's part so i can just watch the bad team😂
We got credits 😂
1:16:19 harry casually smells the sock
VIK smile completely disappeared 😕
Bruh Harry smelling the sock is wild 😂😂😂
REPRESENT Shout out from Geneva <3
Cashpur is brilliant
Kasper the MVP of this video
this is a real banger
Imagine with the credits rolling they didn’t tell anyone this was the final sidemen sunday video ever and it pans out after they talked about growing old and looking back on the troops in the cabin
I love when all three nigerians are on the same team
Sidemen holiday vids r now more like a cinematic movie jeeeez
Bad teams room mate actually seem kinda cool tho😭
jj lokey a moron towards the guy with glasses
Vik getting on with the boys at the end is so satisfying I feel bad for him
Idk recent sidemen Sundays vik has not been treated equally only Simon and Harry treat him properly put he provides so much content and make everyone else happy.
2:50:59 nahh harry 😭😭
best one so far fr. felt like a movie. need moe
3 hours?!?!? Is this an Avengers film or something 😂
JJ's supposed to be a boxer and he loses his breath just thinking about climbing a rock wall....
I keep replaying 1:39:00
1:17:21 whamneek 😂😂
2:49:03 bro that was lit!!!!!
3hrs IM SO READY
I respect the end credits to acknowledge the team. Huge applause to everyone who works on sidemen videos. They kill it every week 👏🏽
am i the only one that was absolutely disgusted by KSI's behavior during the bus ride?
3:00:00 sick ending
The music used in this vid is insane
im sat here with a cheese wrap and s&v hola hoops hahahaha
1:23:20
The "bad" team looks so fun xD
How much money they spend on licensing songs 🤯
Not being funny, I'd rather be dressed like the bad team than the good team
I wanted to see big Steve on the slopes
The fact that harry took a whiff of the sock he got. Lamo
POV The cheap vs expensive series is so good it could be a series on netflix
credits at the end where cool
Honestly how did u guys obtain the music licensing
Vikk always gets screwed over 😢
2:33:08 mxm
Love a long sidemen Sunday
What a movie
GG TO THE BOYS FOR GETTING RIGHTS TO USE MUSIC IN THE VID
JJ looked like frozone 😂😂
Harry’s gave at 2:16:41 killed me 😂😂😂
Vik, KSI, and Simon should definitely be a GOOD TEAM ATLEAST ONCE!!!
1 like = 1 hour of homework :)
finally a hella long video 🤌
#BoycottMcDonalds
01:01:37 KSI biggest meme of all time
🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉
Wow
callux having the time of his lfe 2:50:32
One of the best videos in a long time
Casper: “So long Schlongos”, as he cascades off on the zip line with a cigar in his mouth 😂
Jj is so ungrateful
My husband loves this go on harry and Ethan with the synchronised swimming 😂😂
btw the instructor's character is amazing and he's such a trooper and hilarious! <3
The Editing in this video is unreal !!!!! Let's Go Sidemen.
24:30 i was 100% expecting “Helicopter Helicopter”
absolutely baffles me how vicky can do this but cant kick a football.
Did the cameraman say that he got yelled at by Josh last time he didn’t do something ?
fat neek is back
JJ was acting like a real V´JJ this whole video.
I love JJ’s obsession with “micro-aggression”
not only is the 3h nuts but it really was like a movie from start to end, they've leveled up
Nah Icl this Ksi brudda needs to humble himself man said I’m too rich for this wtf that’s disrespectful asf
Josh loves Tobi and hates Vikk, I remember he swapped Vik to a bad team and Tobi to a good team  in the Spain holiday, he did it again in this video 😂
3 hour video🥰🥰
Am I the only one who thinks the cheap teem has the most amount of fun ....🙃
The end credits are actually really cool, I think they should be in every video. It gives everyone who worked on the video their flowers, and also allows for those people to get more work by way of advertising. It was also just a nice way to wrap up the whole thing while showing shots of the boys leaving their destinations, plus the song choice was just exceptional.
KSI is unbearable
Anyone else notice we got a 3 hour video this Sunday. Can’t remember the last time I had to watch for 2 days, awesome! Thanks for the multi day video this week, big up to the video editors wow!
Bro made it a legit movie 💀💀
sidemen try to survive in woods for a day or two, would be cool
the greatest vid of the year....kudos to the staff and the boys
harry my friend smelling the sock is maaaaaaad
Loved the vid ❤
❤❤
w
Towards the end the boys were posing like they were in a movie  Bad team always ends up being good
Oh whats my favorite movie ?  BANGER SIDEMEN SUNDAYS ARE MY FAVORITE MOVIES
last five minutes is a banger lmaooooo
Nah this was a banger I enjoyed this question did anyone watch it in parts coz I watched it with no breaks? But Yh love it can’t believe it was 3 hours ❤
W instructor what a guy😭
Where is kaspar from? I‘m swiss and our accent isn‘t like that
The production quality these days is phenomenal
jævla briter
Why are Tobi and KSI literally always on the good team? Seems a bit to convenient..
Someone clip this guy 1:15:34  Sell the cheese
I really hoped KSI had a bad team, He hasn't had on in a while.
josh came up with another banger🔥
love it!
Ksi body is like a gta online character experiencing aging
1:14:43 Behzinga and KSI are a funny duo🤣🤣🤣🤣
W video
JJ being on the good team is so predictable and boring now
JJ really need to humble himself.
Cashpur was fun
Harry is the cutest human alive 😂❤
I actually thought JJ was quite humble. After this i know what jake paul means when he says ksi’s ego is disgusting
I've only watched 55 seconds and the editing and video already looks amazing!
someone needs to humble KSI
14:06 the way Ethan looked back at both tobi and JJ after saying migros😂😂😂😂
This is not the bad team. This is the cheap team 😭
So much respect for tobi on that coach. JJ and Ethan not so much
Vik carried the bad team it would’ve just been complaining the whole time. the lack of respect for him is crazy.
Ofc Harry smells the sock xD 1:16:18
Now this is a Sidemen Sunday
😂😂 2:58:06 my man have done one of the backetlist wishes😂😂
One of the best Sidemen videos of all time, big up Josh🔛🔝❤️‍🔥
Get vik on the good team. And get that fatty Ethan on the bad team he doesn’t deserve anything good. Always whinging
josh❌ chef✅
Bruh randolph comedy saved the bad team ngl
The last bit was super wholesome more of that I beg
Post more Sunday videos with this duration lol
Fatneek is back !!!!!!!
W josh
A 3 hour video is crazy
1:14:50 tf am I watching 😂😂
This video was so good🔥
49:10
#vikkstar get the good team next time

Couldn’t stop laughing at Kasper and Jj  😭
wHY DID harry smell the womens sock??
What watches are Ethan and JJ wearing? 1:24:03
i lose enjoyment when i see which team has good and bad destination from the thumbnail
10/10 banger sidemen Sunday
forcing harry to drink is kinda sad tbf the man dont wanna
3 hour! Longer than most movies.
Very good new concept   Felt more like an actual show than just chasing likes and views   👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻keep it up lads
1:51:00
2:16:50 Titans in real life
Yeah
I started watching yesterday, and I'm still around 1 hour. 3 hours is long, lads
why is it 3hrs looong
fatneek is back!!
Ethan definitely a secret fetler always does really queer stuff
I love Harry, his optimism is so refreshing.
What a long video! Vik while braving illness, got done dirty again by Josh! It's reason why Josh is most boring Sidemen
I was eating then i saw ksi's face closeup going down skyline. 😭
Seems like it's always the drinkers on one team and the sober guys on the other, and then the drinkers are the cheap team  to make it more interesting
ethan looks like the albino out of me myself and irene at the start of this vid in the taxis🤣
the bad team's outfits 🤣I'm dying lol...
The lads have cooked a whole movie
It's an sidemen movie
Hahaha the clip Vikstar shared of JJ falling over in the slop is absolute banter
Man Vikk deserves so much better 😢
Guys, we need all the sidemen to donate to the hardestgeezer’s fundraiser!!! Support your fellow Brits
I can’t lie this was one of the best videos I’ve watched and please start making videos this long it was really good to watch ❤
Harry sniffing the sock😂
1:08:16 The fatneek has returned
Vikkistar123😂
Honestly it could’ve been better
1:23:21 this was a good shot with the boys, was like a movie fr
Like the video bitches, even tho we know Josh will still host lol
Harrys face everytime vik says something dumb 😂
not harry smelling the sock
after all this if vikk isn't in the good team in the next video we will riot.
KSI knowing that water is two atoms is actually mad.
40:24 i mean this catch it was really impressive
Guys getting excited by things they have in their own homes or could buy with a click of a finger 😄
1:16:19  naa we aint skipping passed him smelling the sock lol
Hahahahaha
Last part of the video let's get the second channel on the main channel
2:40:03 Faith is gunna be mad at this 😂😂
Joshua Zerkaa masterclass!
Josh is gonna cook with summer holiday
Just finished. What a video that was!🙌💝
37:51 security dropping loose game
gang sleepover!!! wholesome fam
Josh wanting host so he can take a few days off work whilst the rest carry him
Best sdmn Sundays in a long time. Production level was crazy and the music choices 🔥.Love seeing the boys together aswell 🥲.
Holy sheet, the twist at 1hr 30 mins xD. Wuhuuu
2:53:52 what’s the name of the background song??
A sidemen vid as long as Oppenheimer is crazy 😭
JJ got karma😂
Bad/Cheap is team is secretly the good team 😅😂
3 hours is a little bit too much 😫
The ski instructor too funny flirting with Jj
Huge respect to the editors
2:20:44 Vik finally gave into the sadness 😢
This was a banger
JJ in the bad team is more fun, So sad that he is always in the good team....
35:42😂
I'd rather be on the bad team 😂
"He's had a stroke" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
JJ is always getting the good team, Should be changed!
Feel bad for jj Lowkey bro was so happy in the good team when they switch, the man went depressed
Black men can’t ski 😅😂😂😂😂
i need ai that auto mutes when its just ksi yelling. he needs to chill on that
tobi is the goat best attitude about the worst things no wonder he always gets the good team
2:12:50 As a person living in a hot country men that is legit paradise 😭
The best production level on YouTube no cap
W
1:16:18 Harry smelling the sock is just like him
Simon making sure that Vik feels included   Everyone: I Liked that
Why did harry smell the sock
JJ needs to now stop acting like that in videos man, he is ruining the video
Best sidemen sunday ❤
its an absolute banger fuc**ing breaking out of the roofs
Tobi getting that happy ending, Twice!!
why is harry crying he was just in the  maldives
Shouldnt eat cheese with meat
2:50:26 vik is so wholesome here,  'NOW IT'S A PARTY ' love that guy
Unreal! what a sidemen Sunday!!
Honestly that ending with the sleepover was my favourite part from the whole thing, just the genuine laughs and stupidity! The level of editing was so much better too, music and even credits at the end such a small but big difference!
2:28:47 Vik's face when he says i am really upset 😢
I just watched a movie
I really badly wanted to see KSI on bad team it's proper content 😂😂😂
Josh absolutely kills it every time! creates the best trip, best content, and best teams! I hope Vik gets his chance. And big ups to the camera crew! Getting the best views and angles of this group!
Best sidemen Video till this day🔥🔥🔥
ksi has become my least favorite sidemen after this one ngl.
top 3 vid on the sidemen channel, i loved this
Tbh I actually really enjoy these vids
Ksi always gets tuengood team It's boring  Let us see the team selection process
More 3h videos please
6:28 losing respect for JJ disrespecting people's trip but saying 'too rich for this' fuckin hell imagine how they felt hearing that they had to play it off. I'd kick out JJ from the bus. A brat he is now. Fame got to his head
When other team was figuring out whether it was a serial killer, the other team was doing flips like a duck😂
That german gut must be the most fake ever
what logo was on the pool table
congrats to the camera crew - the quality of this video is insane
I swear jj is a big baby😂😂😂😂😂
1:26:07  harry was traumatized 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cashpur was so funny
1:49:49 where is Simon?
2:16:40 has got to be one of the funniest bits in this video, if not the funniest
33:20 well well well LOL
is it just me that thinks  jj can put  more effort into the videos and have respect for his friends.   He's kinda always complaining in every video i see and that's kind of a mockery to everyone his with.
Is it just me or does Vik seem burnt and bullied by the Sidemen. The second the friends showed up @ 2:50:00 he was so estatic and instantly changed to the Vik we have known and Love.
I love Ethan’s laugh so much
3hr sidemen video?!? We don’t deserve this honestly 😂
I was happy watching the video until Randolph’s face popped up out of nowhere, my day is ruined.
Casper is easily the best person youve had on one of these 😂😂
Peak content! 1:18:10
17:55 why does Ethan looks like he has a terminal illness in this bit
i bet Netflix would buy this btw !
3 hours video. gonna be awesome
Casper is brilliant
Harry's titan run on the suspension bridge was so funny
fat neek is back
I would leave the sidemen if I was vik
2:16:40 Straight out of an Attack On Titan scene
Yo jj looking hench uno. Is he going up weight for his next fight
Wayyyyy too long
Either this gonna be long dinner or imma turn it in to series and finish it in parts
Vik w
2:16:42 is a violation 😂
3 hr is what we want
Btw ggs lads #2 trending damn
All I’m saying is we didn’t see Toby again that first night 🤷🏽‍♂️
Just saw top comment and realised it's 3 hours long... 💀 FUCKIG 3 HOURS TF BRUH AND I HAVE TO WATCH IT TOO I CANT STOP MYSELF FROM WATCHING :/
Great video loved it
W ending, w team holiday
3 hours is crazy okes
Intro is fking lit props to the editors honestly behind the scenes work
3:00:03 Woah woah woah Randolph's name is ANDREW??? Tf..
this video was a journey 🙌
can anyone tell me where the boys were skiing????
ANOTHER FIRE VID GARRRHGHH
Tbh even if JJ stayed on the good team, it doesn’t look like he’d have that much fun
fatneek is back
2:16:40 wtf is that? 😂😂
It was like a movie and the songs were bangers ♥️
2:16:44 Harry running across the bridge 💀
30:00
I think I will not be able to watch the whole video in a week
Same as I would say the most entertaining out of these now is Harry vik ethan they should have been the good team
Wait I just came here and the Sidemen Sunday is 3 HR. LONG!! Damn boys. 😮A great weekend for sure.
Kfc on that zipline was jokes😂😂
might be a dumb question, are they using copyright music or have regulations changed or why is certain music in this?
Closeup shots of JJ’s face are the best thing ever
They did Vik dirty with this one 😢
The best video ❤❤
I don’t like how josh keeps pressuring harry to drink
2:16:10 - Such a wholesome moment between the boys and Casper - and the chaotic switch to Harry running across the suspension bridge was too good 😂😂😂😂
This is SIDEMEN at its best! Yes bois!
DAMN 3H❤
2:16:38 this bit is hilarious 🤣🤣
great video !!
That was a great view of Harry’s nose
JJs sledging  POV is mad
For some reason this felt like a final final episode that the sidemen would do.
nah man feeling bad for Vik, they chose harry over Vik is really disappointing especially tobi
BEST MOVIE.
Banger
camera work is crazyyy
That good team house is top 3 ever ‼️
59:59 this view is insane 😂😂😂
1:00:00 thats a lot of forehead
Best ending !
Its so wholesome to see everyone together Kudos to JJ he became his best version
Easliy the best Sidemen sunday thus far
I literally just got back from there😮
@ 1:17:36 is sounds like they are in a Cult
unpopular opinion, JJ's lack of enthusiasm in these videos is very boring.
Well done josh amazing video ❤
Ksi is fat now
Nahh I literally just finished the summer holiday one and now the winter holiday? LETS GO
This one’s very funny 🎉
Not a lot of people get 4,5 million views in a day after uploading 3hour long video . Its just wholesome to watch it all am i wrong ?
best video of the year
Where is France did they go skiing
Where is kon
Harry sniffed her sock  ! 😂😂  1:16:18
1:24:56
This is the best side,en. Idea I’ve ever seen!
9:32 dang
jj's such a baby
The video would be more banger if ksi was in the bad team along with Harry
Cashper is the goat
This is what I call 11/10 video
The song at the start is from when there's a try disallowed or allowed in the super league (rugby)
Just let it happen
JJ should never be on any of these videos he's annoying me
Tobi saying "I can tell my mom I can ski now" is pure gold
Are we all gonna ignore the fact this is 3 HOURS LONG?
This style of sidemen sundays can be the future
tobi fast asl
best part of the day is a 3 hours sidemen video, it makes the day so much better, love the long videos, makes my day
What a danger vid 🎉
Vik to Goated 🐐
Harry did not sniff the sock, seconds after the girl got out of them
HARRYYY KNOWSSS!
1:54:14 he called Simon harry??? 💀😂
Felt like a whole movie being 3 hours
The best time is 1hour
Shout out for the editors good ending bro like'd it so much
Wonder how they using so many copyrighted music tho
bad team's video was so ggoodd looking
JJ and Ethans new game 'Top Trunks' 😂
Man best sidemen Sunday this year
bad teams outfits were sooo much better than the good teams
42:05 the way Behz is looking at that fondue is the lustful gaze of a man who used to be a big man
viks the biggest king.
Is my audio messed up or is josh nearly silent when he's on the phone with the bad team
VIK NOT GETTING A VOTE 😢😢😢
Vik, Lux, Ethan Josh, Randolph, Simon JJ, Deji, Tobi Harry, Calux, Steven.  Dropped in the middle of no where, survival challenge or race across Australia/Europe.
Funniest video by far, good to see old Sidemen are back!! The content and editing topped this video we’d love to see more well done lads
man said screw the rock paper scissors
Let's be real vik is definitely the young Sheldon of sdmn
yall forgot how to edit man
KSI can actually be so unlikeable
the fatter KSI becomes the funnier he is. The fatneek will return soon.
2:59:46 Yeah they cooked ❤️‍🔥
i don't know what it is about Harry and Ethan in the pool but it made me so happy
Vik is the most genuine of all and they don’t respect him enough
Vikk is a great sport tbh.
Peak sidemen is back
those divers were so dead 🤣
Honestly the bad team would be a blast, the fact that their complaining so much just ruins the video, vik is the goat
JJ is so f boring, unwatchable had to skip everytime he speaks.
First time that I've read the end credits and actually it felt like i watched a banger movie
Simon bitching. Anything new?
i was waiting for a schumacher joke from Harry🤐
First time saying this, it was boring bro. Expected more. Bad team always had fun but this time nah bro poor planning.
Kashpur is obviously the better teacher
Absolutely amazinggggggggggggggg one of the best videos ever ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
WWWWW
I think Josh had some personal grudge with vik.... cause he always put him in bad team....My Man Suffering 😢
The ending was so awesome and cute 😢❤❤❤❤❤❤
Josh, love the video but feels like this time bad team  cabin might've not been a very good idea cuz boys were too drained and it's unnecessary cuz it doesn't provide viewers nor the people there any enjoyment at all.
We can only pray 😂😂
one of the best sidemen holiday videos. ever.
3 hours !!!!
Nar I like when jj is in the good team cause vik is the same way when he’s on the good team
JJ is so mean😂😂😂😂😂
2:16:39 the cut 😭
1:34:07  Bro look majestic🔥
This was for real a movie
Sidemen are actually clear
1:30:29
Solid Long Form effort gents, quality sound track and good storytelling  I would like to see a different format like a get lost in x format as that could provide even better stories!
39:25 nah Vik’s wild for this💀
Honestly i was worried abt how long it would take me to finish this video and now that ive watched it all i kinda already miss them.
The intro really was on a different level
Why are they doing movies now
Sidemen Sunday >>> Oppenheimer 😂
Sidemen Sunday >>> Oppenheimer 😂
Crazy to actually see how many people go into making the video in the credits and to think there’s more then that to with people like Steve who have to go through it all just to protect these nonces hahahah great video really stepped it up with this one Josh a great one
37:49 wow, ethan is absolutely HORRENDOUS at using a camera. it's like he's never held one in his life
The cinematography of this video is actually insane❤
❤ vik man he always does his best in the bad team
w
ww
Ammmaaaaaazzziiinnngggg
Loved the transition into the ad and the ad itself 🔥🔥🔥
3 HOURS OF SIDEMEN YES PLS
32:44
3hours??? Are u mad?!!!
The last bit was a gem
2:16:40 😂 love yalls edits. Always seems fun to go on a trip with your best mates, nice to see the nicer side of vacations through these videos
this was a good video bro
We need cheap vs expensive vs josh 😂
i can say fs , they editor cooked🔥🔥
how many cigars did that instructor havee pulled them outta no where
1:16:19 harry sniffed the sock💀
36:23 sniper waiting to take them out
Damn JJ got fat 💀
1:00:08 this camera angle tho 🤣🤣😂
2:50:16 call him vik Gallagher
1:14:36 The greatest moments on youtube history😂
She took out her sock for cheese...wow
Generally think the cheap teams experiences are better, these are memories and vibes
Strength Knowledge Integrity in the mountains  Whole new meaning for SKIing
W vid
W
WWWWWWW
Sidemen just casually released a youtube video longer than most movies
Seeing Jj without the abs is so weird to me 😭
jeez... 3 Hours  It will be a even better video than the others then hopefully
What a video!
1:18:06  JJ's fatpack
1:16:18  nthn to see, just a gold harry sniffing a sock
The ''bad team'' is much better.. I wouldn't want to spend time inside any fancy place anyway. If i had 2 days i'd spend it ripping the slopes and getting absolutely pissed, i'd only use the place to sleep in..
Is fatneek making a comeback!?!?!?!?!?!
Bad team need to appreciate where there are, I would love it. And Jj need to chill out. Or not be there
Best sidemen vid this year
2:16:40 this is soo funny😅😅 harry face cam
1:20:00
ksi needs to humble himself, he was so rude in the bus
Everyone praising vik just cause he came out with his illness, my wife has had same illness for 20 years its not bad as people make out
Best of the best sidemen Sunday  wohhhhhh 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Casphur kissing simons hand and then the immediate transition to Harry running across the bridge was golden 🤣🤣
vik says let me get the bed.. im sick.. 20mins later the boys show up.. hes ready to party hahah
Those 3 hours flew by! We need more videos this long please! 😍
Damn that Go pro on JJ's head🤣🤣 what angel is that getting man😂
I think it was zerkaa's bachelor party also
Oh yea, somehow the wheel roles Vikk on a bad team like 5th time in a row😂
randolph and co should’ve just stormed in all masked up shouting, would’ve been much funnier. missed opportunity
Best teams  Ksi tobi Simon  Vik Ethan harry
I want a shout out bro sidemen plz😢
best yt video oat
Kudos to all the cameramen who skeed and filmed at the same time
The editing on this video is cold cl
lol
3hrs jeez
That casual talking 2:06:03
56:49 why Harry 😭
"can a man better his life!" screamed harry holding a whole roll of cheese
I Was Just Wacthing Over The Sideman Charity And Wanted to Know Will There Be One In 2024?
what chalet where the expensive team in?
3 hours is insaneeee they be looking after us goodddd ❤❤
Jj moving mad
''im too rich for this'' dude stfu and just enjoy life
I feel like it costs way more than $200...
At the guess who in real life I swear I saw Kobe
A sidemen Sunday longer than dune, gotta love it
The credits are mad, sidemen are massive.
Its really nice to see vikk doing well
Best Sidemen Video of the Year atm 🔥🔥
this is a movie
3 hours is crazy loving it, had to take a break at 1 hour tho 😂 back on it
The last night scene in the dark had me dying 😂
That german was funny asf
i love to see jj on a bad team but hes also funny on good cos hes wierd
No votes for Vik is insane
Seeing viks smile just leave his face when he heard no one voted for him 😢😢
Vik being ill in the last video and then not getting a single vote for the swap in this video, give this man his happy ending in the next one
None of the  other sidemen members like vikk so he is always in the bad team😅
1:18:14 is best 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
01:16:19 Harry Care To Explain?
39:39 Simon, if all the sidemen were the same height 💀
19:40
It was such a good ending 🤌🏻
Is it just me or does ksi look a bit fat in this video when he was on the swing in the swimming pool
3 hours cmon are u being for real
jj has been watching friday night dinner
JJ on the bus at the beginning might be the funniest I’ve ever seen him. He was absolutely hilarious 😂
At 33:44 JJ looks like the missing member of Milli Vanilli 😂😂😂
This is an amazing video Josh! One of the best by far!
2:12:48 gotta be one of their best places they've ever been, it's a lifetime experience
35:20 I laughed so hard looking at how fast ksi posed like that !!😂
absoloutely brilliant sidemen sunday so inspirational 🎉🎉
Bruno mars so bankrupt he actually let the sidemen use his song.
I WOULD RATHER CHILL WITH THE CHEAP TEAM LOOKED SO MUCH MORE FUN
Honestly, weaker holiday video
Vik has been on far too many bad teams for them to not vote for him to swap.
This video was so amazing! Sorry *MOVIE*!🤩 So many good moments!😂🙌🏼 Harry running on the bridge killed me! Super funny! Going to be One of the best clips of the year in my book😂😂
Vikstarr more like viktim man has been playing victim whole life
Racism against the Indian 😅
We need Expensive vs Cheap vs Josh😭😭🙏🏽
masterpiece!💙
No way harry sniffed that socks
we need more casper
33:43 Tobi is so funny 🤣🤣🤣
25min in and I realised the video is 3 hours.. wth.. guess we ll watch it over 2 days..
I WAS TODAY YEARS OLD WHEN I LEARNT RANDY’S REAL NAME
This is 3 hours damn
its 3 hours indian movie bro
The ending was so nice :)
Not harry smelling that sock 😂😂💀
The outro made it fully feel like a movie..  😂😂😂
Casper and JJ interaction is LEGENDARY 😂😂
Vik and Toby are so wholesome. Beautiful young men
That ski guy for the bad team was horrendous
Sidemen must came to Eretrea, Lesotho and Congo.) In a rural area.)  It will be fun.)
We’ve had a 3 hour sidemen video before GTA 6
Never saw a video 3 hours long
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW 🗣🗣🗣
The night two ending was the best partt😂😂
why did he smell the sock
what a banger of a video tho
imagine josh just having them swap transportation back to back lol
Its crazy to think, that they were sitting, where i once sat aswell. (I live in switzerland)
Harry is definitely my fav Sideman, all the guys are great but Harry's positivity in face of shitstorm is just inspiring and love how humble the guy is.
that's so wholesome at the end of the clip hahaha
That was not just a Sidemen Sunday it was a Movie.😂😂
Whats so bad about drinking on a holiday dude. All the drama damn
Vikk is elite 🗿 idc what the rest have to say about him
fatneeek is back
I can watch the last 10-15 minutes part my whole life ❤
The interaction after harry got a text from his dad was the most British thing ive ever seen
14:05 we all definitely miss heard that 😂
11:20 who else was reminded of jj doing that in the try not to laugh episode😂😂
BEST SIDEMEN Sunday yet!
Been watching this video since morning still can't get to the end of it
1:16:18 funny how Harry sniffed on the sock
lets go 3 hour video
“Viki” 😭😭
Tbf those outifts harry vik and si had were pretty class. Deffo wearable for skiing and straight into apres
The last time Vik teased gravity he ended up in the hospital 😆
What an absolute dream to do something like this 😍😍😍
“That seems like a micro aggression” lol!
Cheers to Ksi's downfall 😂
Okay but why does Ethan’s laugh sound like Elmo 😂😂 27:40
Insanely good vid
Absolute banger. Josh productions are goated
JJ's Balance is that of a 6 month old baby, Baffling.
The ending is priceless!!! Love every moment of their laughter<3
3 hours yessss
56:50 WHY, we have not done anything :/
Noo I'm should have went skiing when I had he chance😭. Now I missed the chance to meet the sidemen😭
Yooooo 3hrs? Haha nice I got one day off and I spend it on this video and back to work tomorrow 😭🥰🥰
Mr. Cashfer picking up JJ like a baby, kinda cute.
I usually don't comment but production on this video was insane. Absolutely amazing!!
Can we stop putting KSI on the good team please he ruins it
54:30 audio mistake 👍
One of the best videos on YouTube , it was absolutely incredible everyone was so funny and all 3 hours of it was worth it the production, camera work and even the credits was amazing I would watch 1 million times over cant wait to see more like this 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
1:16:18 why did harry smell it ?
I think Vikk is overdue a good team in Europe one day. Has Tobi never been on a bad team in Europe?
Legendary intro music
Sidemen be making movies
Saw 3 hr video and didnt watch , saved it 4 the night. Happy days😂❤
I want to see a wholesome vacation video with all the 7 sidemen
3h WTFFFFF
JJ again in a good team, god
Why is Harry so ungrateful :/
Dressed up like an alternate tv show called puffer rangers
3 hours for a sidemen sunday is too much and I'm here for all of it.
Can we get one of these at least once a month
Gotta feel bad for vik man 🥲
wow. just wow. the best ending from sidemen video ever
I want Vik’s snowsuit 😂😂❤
2:37:09
Where is it they went?
No way this video is 3hrs long 😭
the bad team got niced this one tho, that second cabin looks like so much fun!
1:35:37 Vik's face melted my heart, Throughout this whole video he was trying to up the mood and even with the last part when boys came he was ready for party and happy, Having no vote is sad ngl😢
Petition for vik to be in the expensive team
Harry at 2:16:43 running like a titan is killing meeee
harry smelling that sock 😂😂
Harry looking like an abnormal titan when running across the bridge
2:16:39 LMAO, WTF. THIS SENT ME LOLLLL
يقلدون فالكون 😭😭😭
u guys just made a movie here
This is worth 3 hours of my life, best time watching the sidemen.
This is one of my favorite videos also good editing
The sleepover vibes were so nice, it can be a whole sidemen video 😂
Toby was having a massage for 1hr of this 3hr video.
this was a banger, we need something like this again in a future sidemen sunday. Maybe a summer holiday edition?
Tobi’s had so many good team experiences but nobody minds because he’s so grateful 🥹
1:18:05 my last 2 brain cells during an exam 😂
why tf is jj looking fat
Ethan and JJ is a very underrated duo🤣🤣🤣
This is a top 10 sidemen vid of all time
The ski instructor with the cheap team needs recognition for putting up with JJ😂
1:09:58 play at full volume around the family , trust 🙏
A classic Josh W
Nah the way they were trying to push for jj to get punished kinda erked me ngl
Man what a video this is what we wait a Week for 🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼
One of the best sidemen videos out there
1:26:23 yor skiing abilitys will be tested the black men will be arrested
Yay more sidemen
I CANT BE ASKED
They gotta sing the Josh song at the charity match
among us sledding
What a video
Do this, do that....fukin wham head 😂
Took me 3 sessions to watch this, but was worth it 🙌
There’s me wondering why it’s 3 hours long. Then realising it’s probably cuz of the massive list Josh gave Vikk Harry and Simon😂
1:18:26 Imma jus leave this here 💀💀
Did anybody else notice JJ's reaction time when the salami fell from the knife at 40:27, Brother didn't even look and caught it like it was nothing!!
55:12 Harry I’m not drinking anymore! Sinking a bottle of Champagne in the car
Amazing lads well done, my nxt holiday
3 hr vid daamnn
i fell so bad for vik😭
Josh definitely has some of the best holiday videos imo
2:16:44 Why does Harry looks like a Titan running in the anime, AOT😂😂
56:44 Gutter Danmark blev nævnt i medierne 🗣🗣🔥🔥
What a banger!! Love you guys from Australia!
3hr of sidemen! This is mental!
w vid
Boys the quality of this is elite!!Poor Vik though. I’ve known a few people with chrones and it’s debilitating.
3 hours?!
Why is it the older I get, the more depressed I get after watching these holiday videos 🥲. Games the game I guess
Harry and josh are the best 🫶
JJ is so insufferable. He ruins so many good teams because he complains about everything
I have just rewound harry running over the bridge 7 times 😂😂
W FCKIN JAMES FRAMZ
This was ace
JJ is very funny! Hope he quits the bad attitude.
WHAT A Video and amazing production THE GOATS of youtube
So cool that you managed to get Eminem in this video since Ethan couldn't make it.
Absolute Banger! <3
Harry with Being a Titan 2:16:50 xD
2:16:40 THE GREATEST CAMERA ANGLE 😭😭😭
Worth every second watching this
Absolute banger of a vid, gg
TOBI AINT GETTING THE PRESENTS FROM SIMON FOR HIS BIRTHDAY
what an ending. full of joy. even with cheap holiday. just having a great time.
like I do like it when the sidemen do these type of challenges but the only thing that ruins this whole video is JJ's. Like he complains and shouts when he's on the bad team but when he is on the good team it looks like he just doesn't care. Like make up your mind enjoy it or don't.
Thank you so much for this guys ❤️
Harry: "I was suicidal" Camera guy: "re-read the list" 😂
3 hour BANGERRRSSSSSS
Bros dropped 3 hour long movie
make jj on bad teams already
POOR GUY JUST WANTED A PICTURE
Hi It's Cashpur
the next time if Vik doesnt get the good team....
🔥🔥🔥
I just love watching Zosh cook JJ xD Its the best. But not just JJ alone, he cooks the whole team and its pure content xD
2:12:47 this whole bit  of the beautiful mountain scenery with paradise playing, but then the cut to JJ falling over in his skis and Casper trying to give him the kiss of life, JJ threatening to spar vik and vik running off giggling “YOU WILL NEVER GET THIS” 🤣🤣🤣 had to save the timestamp for a rainy day
can i be in the next video
btw ksi never got on a bad team last few years
W video
2:16:40 😂that segment was hilarious
1:16:19 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
I did my breakfast watch it.. Then lunch ... And now i'm done with my dunner but 13 mins are remaining so it will be for my tomorrow's breakfast..😅
By sidemen winter holiday you meant a movie
I thought it being a 3 hour video that it would get boring at some point but actually turned out to be one of my favourite videos so far this year... keep dropping them bangers
One of the best Sidemen videos 🤩🤩👊👊
jj has let the money get to him disappointing to see
Banger video/"movie" 👏🏽
24:31 I was really hoping for helicopter helicopter
Watching JJ enjoying the good team is very fun for some reason.
I love how they all wanted JJ on the bad team then everyone on the bad team instantly regretted that XD
2:16:40 😂
Ethan laughs like Elmo dressed like Elmo 28:56
PO, LALA and DIPSEY GO SKIING
Omg JJ is fat again
Vik’s fit went crazy 🔥
The part in the dark with the boys just being boys is so good we need more natural un professional content like that 😂😂
Can anyone tell me the location of the team with ethan, jj and tobi. 🙏
Ksi is a body builder
1:26:11 😂😂😂 BRUV SOUNDED LIKE TRACRTOR😂😂😂
Vik is always so humble and positive.
poor cameramen for bad team.
Luv u zerkaa boy
Casper was the perfect counter to JJs energy
What are they wearing on thier wrist .... Just a black band or something else???
One of the best sidemen sundays out there, if not the best! Also great music choice throughout the video! And editing was amazing! Keep up the good work boys❤
2:06:00 got the biggest smile when Simon said GOT THE BOOST BOYS 😂🥹
I’m an hour and a half in, praying for ksi downfall
3 hr special ehh
JJ does not deserve to be in the good team
Fatneek is back
Enjoyed this ao much
Good video but some of the boys are just bums ngl I've watched the sidemen from the start and even some of them before that and too see soke people (Simon mainly) just showing like no effort at all really, after all the work that gets put in these videos he really show nothing. Kinda upsetting. Fair play to vik tho on bad team alot and he's the only one actually making it entertaining for bad team side and obvs ksi is just being ksi tbf. Good video tho
Big up vik 🔥
save palestine
im so happy they got ski aggu to teach them how to ski
2:16:39 Harry fuckin kills me 😅😂🤣
its mental how far this group has come over the years.
1:18:28😂😂😂😂
1:16:19 aaye yo Harry letting his intrusive thoughts win.
bro surely the production's leveled up like damnnnn
L ksi for beeing mean to regular ppl for beeing regular ppl
fav bit 42:20
3 hours….denm!!!
Harry's nose cam is elite ELITE
My new favourite sidemen video😂
Best Sidemen sunday ever!!! I might as well watch it a few more times❤❤
so good.
tobi and ethan this whole time has made me laugh so much with JJ I swear. togetherthey  are the funniest team @42:57
Sidemen endgame 😩3hours is crazy
I started watching the video, got to about an hour and realized I had 2 hours left…I ain’t complaining 😂🤷‍♂️
Is it just me that hates seeing KSI happy?
a 3 hour video what a treat for me, love the work and effort put into the videos
Ethan telling he now has a prada surfboard proudly even when vik is the reason for him to have a prada surfboard and still  didn't vote for Vik to be on the good team made me sad Poor Vik he is too nice for this
3 hours it’s gonna take me all day to watch it a work!! Love it 😂😂
Where did Simon go?
They could’ve made 2 videos out of this
Putting KSI on good team is criminal...that guy needs to be pit of his zone he needs to be grounded and him suffering in cheap team is a pure entertainment 😂😂
The amount of times I’ve had to turn my tv down because of JJ and Ethan
2:16:42 calfreezy??
JJ is a 30 year old millionaire and still thinks screaming obnoxiously is peak humour
JJ used to have so much fun doing everything, his taken this grumpy fun hating persona too far now, we need KSI back please
Well I guess someone needs to leave the Sidemen.
3 hrs of pure entertainment, the last bit when the lights were off was my favorite part, the lads were laughing at vik being a npc😅😂😂😂
This is a good video
18:00 his beard ain’t even ginger it’s orange
The man who didn’t know Rock paper scissors >

Josh makes the best videos
3 hours, im sorry what?????????????
Ksi already fat again I see

Fatneek is back😩
Zerkaa is the best host best planning awesome video, Harry is the funniest host to watch, wholesome video to watch.
3 hour video? 😳
When Im free its a 50 min video and when I have exams, its an Oppenheimer movie. But yeah watched it all and enjoyed.
2:30:35 MOST LIKELY TO talk abt someone’s mom (harry’s) : josh 😂 - just like the moresidemen episode 😭
Where did Simon go when they were with the Instucter he just wasn’t there
honest question does anyone find jjs tantrums entertaining
Best video of the Sidemen ever 10/10
@35:36 im crying!!! XD
Last 5 minutes was so funny
i dont know how Toby always ends up in the good team
Banger
3 hours?!?! Boys settle in 🫡
GG for whomever picked all the music. All fit so well
Sidemen $200 dollar vs $20,000 sleepover...📈📈📈📈
Bro, 3 HOURS?
Tori behaviour from KSI
3 hours sidemen sunday??? Bring it on, I'm ready 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Next video should be Vik choosing who's in the good team with him and Josh in the bad team lol
Sir this video is 3 hours long
Sick intro n music 🔥🔥🔥🔥
imagine asking for a pic with jj and getting called a NPC 🤣
The mighty fatneek has returned
joshs vids are the best
the first minute of this was super lit, sooooooo goodddddd omg
love the movie aspect of this sideman Sunday in future if this was the next step of the sideman Sundays I would not mind it at all. also loved how long it was. good job boys..
The ending were so wholesome, ya love to see it
Now thats got to be a banger!🔥
vikks wink at 1:43:54 had me rolling
where did simon disappear to
I love how casper is so supportive of JJ and suppressing all the loudness and noise that could come out of him ahahah
21M subscribers
18:07 Bro dropped tbe coldest house tour ever🥶
29:50 JJ's fully 7 months pregnant lmao
jj only has the good team please prank him in the next one
14:07 😂
Nick is going home and thinking about those potatos all night 100%
This was just perfect the ending was the sweetest thing, all of them huddled in a hug 🥺🫶🏼
I FEEL BAD FOR @VIKSTAR123
VIK giving Ethan a snowboard and not a a single vote
jj gettin a lil thick😂
Poor Vik, he honestly needs a break from being on the bad team and not having JJ on it with him as well 😅
When Simon voted to swap teams with no words that was so cold 😂
man, it's a great video. I am just sad for Vik.
this their job, complaining the whole time...
@27:47 tobi laughing while face planting the snow XD
2:16:40 harry is really something special
The Chitchat at Night was the perfect ending never laughed this much in a while 😂
Josh saved that night
Vicky: I’ve teased gravity enough!
This was a great video also viks always such a good sport love him
josh is so fine
I don’t understand why KSI hates going down hills so much. Every time there’s a slide or a sled he always just keeps the breaks on 😂
8:15 why tf jj acting like that
Casper needs to be in more videos his funny
I so wanted harry to comeback cheeseless and holding a zoot like i traded 😂😂😂😂
This video was amazing to watch
Why does JJ always get the good team?
2:58:02 real fun starts here man😂
one of the best sidemen sundays
That JJ forehead cam is wild 😂
JJ catch is crazy 40:33
Why is Harry running like a titan lmao 2:16:41
2:16:41 ABSOLUTELY CRACKED UP AT THIS POV OF HARRY🤣🤣🤣😭
Nah I saw 3 hours and screamed “WTF” LETS GOOO!!!
joshua man i love u
fatneek is back
Josh has a last name?!
Josh cooked with this one! 🔥
harry is so ungrateful and immature
what a sidemen sunday, well monday for where I am. enjoyed the video with many funny moments and then ending was wholesome asf
Vik was positive ... Throughout whole journey..he made the bad team experience good. Cheers to his good attitude 😁
I always say it and im gonna say it again, I LOVE CHEAP TEAM, I WILL LOVE TO BE THERE. The troops in the end was actually priceless. Ik the boys understand that THE CHEAP TEAMS ARE THE ACTUAL GOOD TEAMS.
I knew they were gonna do a snow thingy the moment josh uploaded his winter vid… lol😂
jj ruins the second half
Greatest video. It was like a moviee🔥🔥🔥
Ending fire
That is the ugliest snow gear.
Nice to have some montage and music involved. Those drones shots where nice too
1:51:37 What did Simon say? I always thought Keith was girl.😮
Lessuoo
Outdoor>>
Ww
1:02:23 “cheese is rolling away”had me😭😭
vik is da best
Bad team in "SWITZERLAND"? should of sent them to Afghanistan or something 😂
We all knew who was going to be the one with no votes   Poor guy he even shared his gifts last time he deserves better and even though he was sad he didn't show it and gave us good content from the bad team ❤ Big Up Vik
i wanted to write quotes for the best scenes but god, there are too many of them, so heres tobi skiing 2:08:00
justice for vik man 😭😭
3 hours 🤯🤯🤯
I feel bad for " vicky " man, i don't even remember the last time he was on the good team 😂😂😂
This is probably the greatest Sidemen video they’ve ever made in my opinion. Genuinely did not feel like 3 hours at all
we all know vik is their least favourite sidemen  that is why he is also the most favourite of the audience
go to first bus seen and look who is sitting with tobi 5:30 - 6:01 its Q from impractical jokers
Also anyone close to Randy please tell him to stop pursuing comedy he is absolutely trash at it
Tbf those good team ski outfits were awful 😂 I get they were expensive but they were grim
This was a movie
That ski instructor deserves a raise for putting up with JJ
whoever edited this one banged it up fr. hats off
They always put jj in the good team cuz he's always salty nd grumpy in the bad team... while vik is a nerd nd his attitude is dry even on the good team..
1:17:35 JJ just turns into a fire alarm
Of course, standard KSI being ungrateful for everything he has during this whole video. And people want to be like him?
9:10 what even was that??
Ethan…..ohhh no, am about to be sodomised 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was genuinely feeling very sorry for Vik but he is such a trooper honestly. Kudos to him.
One of these videos the cheap team should just say screw it and stay wherever they want
Great vid for 2.5 hrs the that fkn horse Cal freezy had 2 talk.. typical Edinburgh cnt trying too fit in.
Man KSI is fat again 😢
Simon making sure that Vik feels included   Everyone: I Liked that
40:21 Yoooo Ethan😂😂😂😂
Im feeling so bad for vik didn’t got chance in any good team and has to suffer the bad team 😢
Harry's, Vik's and Simons outfits arent even that bad, i would happily wear those anywhere
The editing is up another level!
How is this vid not even a mil likes man😭 common
harry smelling the sock at 1:16:19 had me on the floor. he's too funny
2:33:41 that slide was so wholesome💙
I am so proud of my boy Tobi. He proves himself every sunday.
Tobi wasn’t available after facial as he had to take the masseuse for hers
I was in morzine like 4 weeks ago wopuld have loved to see them there!
the pov of jj at the climbing thing was just to funna man
Fr love zerka
Stinky video ngl, no viral clips, nothing funny, waste of 3 hours
Epic
41:55 I’m so glad vikstar didn’t leave that unsaid, as yes with that challenge it could get out of hand 🫣
Where did the 20K team stay ???
This was an absolute banger of a video! More long content please!!
this video is amazing i love it
Lets gooo🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱 1:24:04
We got a Sidemen Movie before GTAIV
Love the holiday series 👏
where did simon go @1:49:44
this was a MOVIEEE
Vikk saying got the boost boys was class
Sidemen+ isnt working for me? i get a error on the site
3 hoooourssss?1 lets go
What a video use never fail to disappoint
Vik's been hanging out with or watching some Jericho nice spicy water 😂
TEAM NIGERIA FTW
bro why is KSI always on a good side?
josh absolutely cooked with this video
yea hes autistic 1:52:15
Amazing video as always guys!!
german  is such a legend
Vik is an legend man boys really broke his heart when vik doesnt get a single vote. Vik face changed completely and later he forget about it and given more content. The fact that jj as a big guy feared to the sounds cal freezy made outside the house and vik going and checking what happening outside is hilarious and the end sleepover bit man its awesome.
60:00 jj looks like an alien 😂
I might take 3 days to finish this video. 😂
I’m off to Morzine in a week for the second time this season. I’m gassed! 🏂
Harry running back from that bridge while having pov on his nose and flaping his hands like schizo was the funniest stuff I've seen
Wow! What a great video! I can't wait to see what is to come!
Always  quality  stuff!  The sidemen  are always on top!
This was actually amazing
Josh cooked on this one 🔥
Vik is the sweetest sidemen always looking out for others even tho it never gets reciprocated. I feel so bad for him.
Bro 3h of footage
It’s a party now
3 hours of sidemen? yes please
It’s always weird the way the gang up on Jay Jay sometimes. He’s a jovial guy so he doesn’t think much of it, but lowkey it ruins the video a little bit. Josh should have used the challenges to switch the good and bad teams and not voting, knowing fully well that they’ll pick Ksi. Also Simon is a terrible friend
I like the use of music
JJ is actually jarring
The renders are going off with this one
The end of the bad team sleep over brings back soo much memories of having sleep overs with friends and laughing at everything 😂😂
I came in like a werking ball😂 01:08:10
the production on this is so good! sidemen never disappoint
when i saw 3 hours of sidemen video, ive never layed in bed and got the snacks so fast before  hahah
2:40:10  faith's gonna kill ethan😂😂😂😂😂
JJ pulling a Vin Diesel
Sidemen should do Mount Everest base camp trek as a sidemen Sunday!
1:17:33 Ksi looks like barry wood
3 hour sidemen Sunday 😮‍💨😍
Geneva thats  not 200 $
Great Video love it !! 🎉😊
this might be the best bad team to be a part of in the history of cheap vs. expensive
where did the good team go!!
imagine a holiday, INDIA Edition!! The views would go nuts
Only 38 minutes in and this video already had Bruno mars, drake and ROONIN! Wow! These can’t be copyrighted, I’m pretty sure. Did they went all in for this video?
nah, when JJ is lying in the snow: "Teach him how gravity works" 💀
No way randy said Jesus was American
I’m 5 minutes in and KSI needs humbling so bad. People on that coach are there for a good time and have spent their hard earned money. It’s patronising and just rude to essentially ridicule them by shouting he’s too rich to be involved with them. I get that it’s content, but there’s a line and he always seems to cross it
3 hours?? Bro giving us a whole movie!
Nah this is a frickin movie.
Loved how vikk got energised when everyone's pulled up in the end
W
straight up the most laughter and enjoyment I have had from a video in a long time, mad job Josh
Vik trying to take away kon's job by becoming the cameraman.
sry but im not going to watch 3 hours of this
One of the greatest sidemen sundays ever
As soon as I saw the 3 hour video with SIDEMEN under it I knew it was gonna be amazing!!
holly W side+ ad transition. way better and more engaging than just a hard cut. props to whoever decided for that
love the long videos  format was great
How is balsamic oil and vinger rich😭😭😭
Bruh Harry smelling the sock 😂
There should have been a challenge to find a non white person there.
where did they go exactly ?
more movie length videos!!!!
Big ups to the camera man and editors this vid the smashed it through the roof
Firee
Nothing  less than the most comforting movie ever
12:28 why do i have a feeling thisll come back to bite them ahah
There is noway teams are random coz how evrytime ksi and tobi gets good team
3:38 average Behz question btw
The Three power rangers
Viks been my favourite this year this guys glow up is mad
27:24
This is genuinely so sick
2:16:50 is that a Attack on Titans reference?
After a bad day    when I saw a 3HR vid I was gassedddddd let's goooo❤❤
The production is off the charts now BIG W Sidemen
JJ being on the expensive (good) team is my least favorite part of any VS. video
My new favourite sidemen video
Zerka killed it one again love❤
the best video ive seen so far love the cheap vs expensive ❤🎉
they shouldve played a game tbh instead of voting so no one wouldve felt left out
I would say this is their best work yet. The entire video was amazing and extra props to their editor and  producer 👍
Amazing intro edit
23:51 on 23:56 the background music exactly matches the scene😅😅
Absolute banger!!!
that chalet is beautiful wtaf
Oh.my.lord tobi in the good team again , getting ridiculous at this stage
only bangers
I wish someone would pay for me to go on a holiday. Cheap or expensive I know I’d make the most of it
PARADISEEEEEEEEEE
When jj was taking the zip line down the mountain was bants 😂😂
Is there any discount code in this video?
ZERKA cooked and we ATE. lfg
Could u make the vid a lil longer, 3 hours too short, we need 8 hour videos
where is harrys orange coat from?
The quality in these 2024 Sidemen Sunday videos is flipping insane!
This one was one of the best videos on the Sidemen Channel in my opinion, everything was one point and beautiful. That last bit at the cabin sleepover was my favorite. Please host more videos Josh these are actually just amazing.
Objectively, I can see the sidemen are getting bored of these videos.  This was a bit more complaining than I'm used too, but it could be burnout from the previous trip too.
Sidemen out here dropping movies🎉
Not Harry sniffing the sock..😮😮 1:16:11
Man show more footage Who's got bigger Willie it was so fuckin funny man
rolls cheese on ground trades cheese for sock noice
Sorry but tobi and ethan have been niced far too many times simon and vik always end up on bad team i feel.instead of swtiching up individuals zerka should have swtched all 3 good goes to bad bad goes to.good would have been aick
3 HOURSS
The switch from JJ freaking out about the noise on the roof to Ethan and Harry doing Swim-Improv is one of the funniest things I've ever seen 😂
I think poor old vik is due to be on good team bless him.
Maybe everyone is exhausted from pushing so much content but this one was hard to watch! Constantly whining about bad team but it wasn't too bad of a team. Sidemen bad team Vs Good team always had moments but this one had none despite being over 3 hrs. Kasper was pure cringe and not in a good way, could have done without him. Take a break and figure stuff out.
❤❤❤😂
These type of videos are always the best videos, they are funny and have the perfect song choices in them
Feel like Vik and W2S gets the bad end of the stick in these kind of holiday videos most of the time just like how KSI mostly ends on the better team..
36:20 look at simons head theres a laser pointed at him
One of the best for a while. Loved it.❤
Harry's reaction to that snore 1:26:10 is golden
Somehow the good team found a way to have the least amount of fun.
They feel for vick but never helped/voted for him for the switch….. vick always end up with the short stick !! I hope in the next one he gets what he deserves 😄🤞🏻😊
2:58:08 is my absolute favourite Sidemen moment in a long time, its exactly how my sleepovers go and its great to see the guys despite their age still being able to have as much fun as they used to
This is quality!
Jj was mad disrespectful to everyone on that bus… like they were being nice the whole time and jj acts like that.. clearly fame as gotten to him .. can he just be more considerate like?
The fact that he carried jj up from snow is hilarious
why did KSI look like the napoleon fish with his lips underwater
Tryna grow my YouTube who else clips and edits ? Need some tips
bless vikk :(
2:16:42 I swear I thought it was calfreezy
Slaps different with proper music
Josh cooked ngl
37:50 Steve dropping the rizz
Wait wait wait, Why did Harry smell the sock?😂😂😂💀💀
1:25:54 IM DEAD 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Josh cooked ngl
Previously a 1 hour Among us video and now a 3 hour Sidemen Sunday video 🔥🔥
This was in my opinion the best SDMN Sunday. 3hoursss!!
best fking video ever
2:41:52 We can see that on the clock on the wall 😂
51:23 52:45 1:00:22 1:08:28 1:13:07 1:18:22 1:21:48 1:25:52 1:32:38 1:47:15 2:12:20 2:14:00
Complimenting a chef for charcuterie where it’s pretty basic and is just cutting bread up and melting cheese is unintentionally backhanded af
Video is good only till they go skiing after that is awful...
1:24:48 bog's comedic timing masterclass lmao
the last few minutes are so funny im dead
the video i have seen from sidemen so far, it feels like a movie.
Ngl but JJ was crazy rude to those people on the bus…
The ending of the cheap team looks like a sequel to another adventure, cheap teams are always amazing with fun and adventure <3
This was a whole movie🔥Big up the Sidemen for this Banger
josh is like in bad team in every video and no one ever mention him now all sudden for vikk everyone is possessive
Bad teams skiing part us absolutely boring asf.....
Wish the good/bad teams weren't spoiled in the intro. Solid video apart from that
Sad how KSI was roasting a innocent guy who was just trying to get a picture :/
I wonna go to Switzerland too...looks banging 🤯 the kinda 🥶 i'd f**k with
1:16:40 damn bro 😭😭😭
2:17:15 😂😂😂 Simon…in the loo man 😂
NAH JOSH COOKED!!!🔥🔥
omg 3 h yes
What a video 👏🏼👏🏼
Ik jj wanted to fly private 🤣
Best vid ong
agh, the worst possible good team 😆
3 hours jheeeeze, gonna take me 6 lunch breaks
love the long videos
i didnt like ksi in this one making fun of that guy cuz he has more money than him? Ksi should be humbled i get why nobody likes him
This video is insane, but can we appreciate the audio editors and camera men. They are mental for filming and editing this.
3 HOURS!!!!!! WTF😂
Bad Team content>>>> JJ on bad team>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Tobi and Ethan trying to spawn in a driver with a cheat code @11:15 LMFAOO
oh this is probably one of my fav sidemen videos of this year!!! love this new homely vibe to the videos and the credits tie it all in :)))
we need more of kashspur
Ethan and harry always turn knife in the pain when they have good team KSI finaly get reverge and simon vik and harry lets send ksi bad team
i enjoyed the whole video but vik talks too much.
1:16:20 harry sniffing the womans sock 😂
Just got second hand embarrassment from the guy on the coach😭😭
Surely Tobi's in a bad team next time
3 hours is crazy
Tbh the broke team always makes great moments with fans and people around them.. better than rich teams apart from the struggles
Even if the people on the bus were actors, I think that makes it worse, because then it feels planned for them to think it's funny to look down on ordinary people and make fun of them because they don't have the latest iPhone or millions of pounds to stay in a mansion chalet. Very out of touch.
That clip of Harry running across the bridge was so dang funny 😂
The transition to the "24k magic in the aiiiir" Left me speechless
Banger!
W vid
Milady meme coin
This video had me crying bro. This was amazing 😂
2:16:40
Paradise playing in the background while they climb up to the view then showing the incredible view and suddenly stopping the music and cutting to the bad team with jj was jokess
Naahh I swear Ethan is the best😂
Where did Simon go halfway through
3h Sideman Sunday HUHH
I feel so bad for John. That man is the living embodiment of bad luck mostly
Did the guy at 1:04:50 try to land a punch right before the camera cut?
3hrs bruh just drop a Netflix movie
Best YouTube vid I've seen in years.
Damn what a great vid❤
I just love how awful the cheap team keeps getting 😂 old top gear had way worse experiences than this tho so there’s a lot of catching up to do
the edit on this is superb
the last 10 minutes of bad team is proof - we NEED a sidemen sunday sleepover with the troops, no good team no bad team just the boys being boys
JJ need to be in shape , I love him in his PRIME physic.
Such a banger n loved host involved 🙌 💙💙💙
A bunch of 30 year olds snoring with each other 😂😂😂 😂 banger video tho 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
3 hours , love the cinematics
Jesus was american, lmfao xD
These guys are the only ones who can make Sundays better. 3 hour video shows their dedication to this after 10 years still. Amazing man
Where's kon
Petition to Make both teams bad
47:38 this line of simon made me like the video🤣
The editing is so good in this video  like  mrbeast level good
The sidemen casually dropping a movie 😂😂
1:23:15 Chelsea willy 💀😭
Bro really said he is not good with water element 😂😂
2:14:06 What is the name of that place where they tried skii(ethan,harry,tobi)
ok so harry running across the bridge at 2:16:00 made me think he switched placed with freezey lol
Harry smelling the sock killed me 1:16:19
14:38 what a beautiful shot
Ffs 15:31 I thought i saw a glimpse of Kobe Bryant😂
1:04:52 What just happened?
Coldest intro I’ve seen
We need to see KSI Suffer 😢
Am I the only one that thinks that these videos get more cringe the older they get?
The end for the cheap team was nice
Zeekaa don't like vikstart that's  i am 109 percent sure
The Group hug at the end
Banger video! A summer one?
The last 5 mins had me literally crying laughing 😂
How is jj so fat already 😂
No way harry smelled the sock 1:16:00
Absolutely incredible video, amazing job!! 💯🔥
Honestly I'm glad when KSI gets put on the cheap team best reactions and sorrow. It tells him to humble himself.
edits and views are insane Big up the sidemen <3
40:28 that catch was actually cold from JJ😭
Goated Video.
as much as i wanted ksi to be on the bad team, i wish he done glacier 3000
2:33:30 this was mad wholesome
Day 37 asking Sidemen to go and make a video in Philippines
Brooo the editing looks soo good, it literally feels like a movie with the intro of the skiing instructor, the dog sled and the view of the snow-capped mountains. The first view of the mountain looked magical and straight out of a fantasy movie.
This was the madness❤❤
WOW... JUST WOW. Amazing sidemen Sunday and amazing ending. Keep it up!
Tobi looking so sick in yellow outfit jeezz
SIDEMEN GO TO JAPAN CHEAP V EXPENSIVE
This video just shows how ungrateful and greedy they r for money.
This was the best vid Ive ever watched
The shot at 25:27 could be the coldest, hardest album cover.
9:00
2:50:06 well this part was very underwhelming
2:16:40
three hours video haha. This is massive
.
Fatneek is on his way
Votes are in Next content is Josh on a bad bad team for 3 straight days! And Vik and Ethan are in charge 😅😂
23:54 no way just hear to the lyrics while they focus on KSI 😭😭
W video
This vid made me so happy..... Especially towards the end it was so wholesome :))
3 hours🤩
They complain about the skiclothing they wear but most can’t even afford them 🤣. OOSC is actually pretty expensive for the average person… 😅. Okay I like to wear Benger myself but OOSC is very good material.  So they are given clothes worth €1200 (now €1020 in sale) in total. The $200 isn’t correct 😬
The Last minutes with the Lads is why i tune in till the end 2:57:40
1:50:22 such a nice couple 😂
33:47😂😂
JUSTICE FOR VIK
VIK! Deserves a whole vacation on his own! 😂
I didn't even realized that I just watched movie...😭😭
I feel so bad for vick he never gets a look in
honestly a sidemen sleepover would be insane. the last ten minutes of the video was the best
Such a good video man absolute banger!!
I feel so bad for all the people on the bus with jj. He really is a terrible person that can’t understand that the world doesn’t revolve around him.
Sidemen holiday with special guest ( Kai Cenat ) would be 🔥🔥🔥
Imma be honest i think they should make JJ's and Behz's Football willy game a more sidemen video
2:03:16 "Ha ha" was so funny
29:40 Vik's positivity is so refreshing as I could imagine if ksi heard that he would be screaming is lungs out saying "I am too rich for this"
Ethan Can't do a video without mentioning 🍆😂
I skied down the same mountains as the good group 2 weeks ago it’s so good it’s actually mental ⛷️ 🇨🇭
Bro simon is goddamn genius 🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠🧠
i fcking love this guys....the cheap team is always vibes...SIDEMEN soldier for life ❤❤❤❤🔥🔥
It's crazy how ungrateful they can be 😂. Would kill for the cheap holiday.
43:02 "Bro's looking at him like he's a superhero" had me crying with laughter
Best video this year hand down😂😂😂😂
worth it, 3 hours
Sidemen to Asia when
Jj needs to get HUMBLED
This is the kinda we wanna see more, many more 3 hour videos from now on woooooooh les goo!
nah ksi thinks hes some world level person
Petition for vikkstar being the only one on the good team next video and everyone else on the bad team. But 10 minutes in, vik must decide who joins him.
2:58:00 best endings😂
1:14:38 THIS IS CURSED 🤣🤣🤣😭
JJ giving it 'Im going to di" had me creasing - mad to hear Coldplay , an abit of Drum&Bass sneaking in, respect !
Jj in these videos are annoying asf . Too entitled
Best Sidemen Vid so far this YR, Music on Youtube just makes videos 10X better.
23:52 cleannnnnnnnn clip
This is gonna be a long dinner
Ethan actually cold with it on the board
Chalet transition was cold 🥶18:12
ngl, JJ sounds like a spoilt brat a lot of the time
A 3 hour video, that's a lot of content guys. Of course no surprise Josh is hosting this after the Maldives holiday. Let's see how the breaking point has been reached, but the intro music and the twist is sick by the way at half time. It felt I was watching a feature film, but the ending was wholesome and this was top notch. Looking forward to more Sidemen content
1:04:30 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
36:37  there was a Green dot on there head
THREE HOURS OMGG
2:03:14 casper and jj bullying ahaha
This editing is next level 🔥🔥🔥
47:37  nah 🥴 josh isn’t the issue, we just like watching yall embarrass yourselves for our entertainment and food eating experience
Jj on the good team is good because he says the most down bad things
I hope jj is just bulking and not starting to get big again….
Honestly, The Bad Teams Are Always Fun To Watch Did Feel Sad For Vik  But In The End The Boys Brought The Vibe
Production on this is crazy
I live for a moment where expensive team is going to be bad one (all money spent on some embarrassing things)
Harry running across the bridge at the mountain peak killed me
3 Hours long video?? HELL YEAH🔥🔥
Honestly I love the long Vids ❤
I hated them pressuring Harry to drink when he’s trying to avoid it ngl 😂😭
3 hours worth watching
Only real ones watched the full vid
A whole movie... 🤌🏻
3??????????
1:47:38 😭😭😭
Top tier content
but its not winter
The ending 😢I miss having sleepovers with my boys man  Video of the year well done everyone involved  Hold that JJ😂
Is it just me or has KSI picked up weight?
Is this video 3 hours or am I bugging
1:18:05 wtf am I watching..
1:39:31 nah that edit was tooo cold
3 hours , am loving these longer  Sundays boys even if it’s every second week of a 3/4 hour banger is banging 👌
vik is boring asf
Damn, yellow eyes from drinking is serious. Take care W2S!
Did Simon almost get into a fight over rock paper sicissors????
The only good part of the video for me started was when Randy, Cal, and Freezy joined.. Especially Randy's standup
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They never gonna give KSI the bad team lol
One of the best sidemen videos ever!!!!
Harry always complaining absolutely ruined the vibe of this video
Bruh its march 😂
Big banger! 🎉😂❤
I love how all bad team holidays are just  typical family holidays  😂
Yesss 3hr sidemen Sunday!! I already know Josh has been marinating 🎉
rare jj w good team
This was a bit boring one.
Editor - Freddie Miller-Scott...as in Cruger? That's very cool
tobi & jj in another good team and vikk once again in a bad team - ffs!
Idk is it just me but I realised that when ever I watch sidemen or what ever it is of their vidoes… every time when they say “Simon” I hear “ sidemen” for some reason lmao 😂
harry is dobby
the beat drop was sick 2:13:00
Commenting for KSI downfall...
1:07:45 fatneek returns??😂😂
What a video lads, we need more as long as this one please 😭
Poor Vik:(( He's always trying to be positive and is often on the bad team hahah. He deserved it imo
Big up Casper!
Certified Josh Banger
Vik deserves good holidays
The ending is the best bit
credits well deserved because this truly was a movie!
Based on the treatment he is getting, I think Vik would be the first one to leave the sidemen.
Jj is so cringe I beg he's on the bad team next time
25mins in and I'm already having tears in my eyes this is brilliant!
Video idea: do the maths on who has had the worst experience overall on the holiday videos and have the others be butlers and drivers and personal assistants for them on an amazing holiday
1:17:58 set 8 class.

I would watch a whole Netflix series about casper teaching people to ski so funny 🤣
spoiger blocker
spoiger blocker
spoiger blocker
Every like I get, I do a push-up
Sidemen: Normal Ski Holiday v Millionaire Ski Holiday
Ngl JJ kinda ruined the whole second half of the video. Completely killed the vibes
I've eating for 2+ hours... How's this still going!
Props to the bad team ski instructor
Sick of Vikk not getting niced. Justice for Vikk.
1:60:20 , cheeky little sniff 😂
1:01:38  😂
Jj is big again
10:06 wow, didn't know sidemen are rich enough for Vladimir Putin to be their driver.
Cashper is the absolute highlight of this video😂
Why is he fat again
Production for this was NEXT LEVEL! Fair play to everyone!! Music choice and editing were 😍
the cinematography to this is mind blowing
I've never seen Harry so miserable 😂 trying so hard not to rage quit especially with vik just being that annoying friend making jokes 😂
🤣🤣
3 hour video to basically explain Josh's alcoholism
Should have had @RobbieKnox teaching
where was Kon?
3 hour video is crazy.
Josh is what Beavo would look like if he chewed his food
The clock in the background showing the time at the end is hilarious because it just shows how long they've sat their doing nothing 😂
I love tobi but also justice for vik they need to swap sometime cause tobi has been getting far too niced and viks been shegged for far too long
They offered him a joint for the cheese 😂
can every sidemen video be 3 hours
petition for having vik in the good team
Poor Harry! Not great trying to force the lad to drink!
"u guys are stackin straight up ay"
Nah imagine everyone went on the good team and Jj goes alone to the cottage in misery
Bagerrrrrrr 🔥
I love the sidemen.  But, seeing this, I know I'll never be able to afford to see even a hint of snow in my lifetime is just sending me 😭😭
35:08 was a bit odd imo, jj forcing Tobi
Only took me 16 hours to watch 😂 actually love the longer content tbh.
josh such an ick pressuring them to drink
big up harry for taking a whiff of that sock
fatneek season 2 is coming soon
10mil views in under 24 hours I bet
30 year old men btw lmao
This felt like a drama/comedy movie. So good
JJ is such good content when he ends up on the bad team, much less so when he gets on the good team
55:13 😂 "the whites of my eyes went yellow and i got scared"
51:42  it would have been sick if behz cought it.
Perfection
The way Harry immediately takes a whiff of a strangers sock is wild
JJ should get the bad team
10:04:52 Why did that geezer hit simon 😂
Vikrams teams clothes is amazing!!! So 80s/Early 90´s taken from Rocko's Modern Life
Damn the credits it's a full on movie
Production level ❤❤
Triple holiday could be sick, get the troops and people like chris danny chip. And make it like survivor that they have to do challenges to decide what price range they are going
14:16 💀💀💀
Never seen a more cringe human than vik he’s honestly hard to watch
hear me out 2:21:03 cheap vs expensive vs josh sidemen sunday - all sidemen on a team - hosted by steven tries, chrismd, george clarke
The production quality in this video is insane! This might as well be a movie 🔥
Great video
18:12 they really came with the sniper montage edits
need them all 7 together on a same trip it’s sad to see them separated always
The ski instructor was top tier comedy haha
Please stop pressuring Harry to drink.
This was a bangerrrr!!! The outro , the cinematics everything was just perfect , josh absolutely killed it.
JJ on the zip line 🤣🤣🤣
Ethan got BLACKED
how can harry not ski
Randolph gets carried by the sidemen
This will go down as one of the greatest sidemen sundays ever.
The ending was just like an icing on the top.
Insane!!!
Fatneek Is back
Honestly the ending was so nostalgic with the boys just enjoying each others company, really reminded me of them from years ago
why does it look like the bad team had more fun than the good team in this video, especially the first night out
Half the budget for this video must have been the music licensing. Fatboy slim, Ceasar, Coldplay, and Drake!
JJ really asked if water was two atoms
jj is not funny anymore he is just rude
Am i the only one that saw Harry smell that womens sock 🤣
That chef seemed genuinely happy like he was bout to cry or sth.
This was the best video in a long time 👍
toby was funny asf
tobi gets extra mad when ethan farts because he can smell every bit of it 25:02
I always feel bad when JJ gets heat in the comments and on his Reddit because I can still see is nerdiness… and then he acts like a cow like in this video and I’m like… welp. Guess he needs a reality check again… 😂
three fookin hours lads
This was a long day
This feels like the end of the sidemen cuz of the end credits 😭😭
Using copyrighted music adds such a nice touch. Not gonna lie makes the video a 10/10
Did Calluz just licked randy's ear and randy said he liked that 😂 3:00:50
Amazing work Sidemen. Especially the end with the sleep over, it had school camp vibes where everyones awake
this is why i no longer watch em. bro no one gonna spend 3 hours watching this. this is longer than the movie Oppenheimer and a terrible plot
3 hour long sidemen sunday is crazy
I think the bad team makes better content because the emotions are real. The fake millionaire happiness just isn't as entertaining.
2:13:00 that whole moment with paradise playing was truly breathtaking, wowwwww
3hrs is kinda mad
what a video 🎉
The best intro ive seen in a wile love the music
the fact that this is longer than most english movies is crazy
Yo the best!
1:39:43 I knew instantly from the wave and the smirk it was casper 😂😂
2:16:49 Harry looks like Calfreezy😂
KSI needs to be in a bad team, he's too cocky Everytime. Just give him 3 or 4 bad teams in a row plsss
Was gonna say this was like a movie then the credits rolled 👏
FATNEEK IS BACK 1:08:18
This editing was insanely good ❤❤❤
I’m bored
JJ needs to stay on the bad team, he's too spoilt by money that it gets annoying
1:04:52 dude is over....
Wait am I reading this wrong? Three hours. Let's goooooo!
I love the sidemen but Jesus the constant moaning and negativity whilst getting paid millions to be travelling and partying with your mates is really starting to get on my nerves. The whole vibe of the group is slowly changing which is understandable with them all aging but they need to try work it out
Bit late for a winter holiday
Fatneek is back
This was a movie with the ending credits, jeeez!
harry sniffing the sock is mad ya know xD
Why was JJ very rude to the people on the bus??
NGL Vik is sweet 👀
2 Banger videos in a row, that's crazy!
I’m so down bad, I forgot they were swimming in the end.
1:00:00 nah the camera angle 😭😭😭😭
can we have a sidemen holiday video where all the boys are in the same team
The NPC one got me dying😂😂
A 3 hour Sidemen Sunday that’s something
3 hour video holy
God tier
1:16:19 harry doing harry things
I honestly think this could be the best Sidemen Sunday ever!!!
That was such a amazing ending  It honestly made me tear up 😭😭😭
Next 100 mil video ?????
too much skiing for 3 hrs no ?
Has Vik ever been on the good team?
3 hrs wtfff 😂
Music choice banged ngl
I would love To see one of these Done but none of the teams go to the bad team (or the other way around). But they are tricked into thinking they Will be in the bad team only for the two teams to find out at the end of the video That both of them were on ”the good team” (or both of them were on the bad team)
#stopvikkabuse
great intro!
2:04:22 ❤
JOSH MASTERCLASSS
1:47:49 just leaving it there
Harry running on the bridge made my life 😂😂
Loveeeee the music choice at the start, so gooooood!
1:16:18 are we going to talk about what harry did and why?😂😂wtf!!!
The entrance of Casper/Cashpur and his interaction with KSI cracked me up 😂😂😂
The editing goes CRAZY!!
the coach ride to the alpine was my favourite part of the whole video 😭
….
The ending was wholesome af 🥹
Damn 3 hour video❤️🔥
10/10 boys
When josh blew in to harry drink tha 100 percent stoped him from chuggin it
That dog poo shoulda been censored.. wasnt ready for it
Harry,vik, Simon are very calm people they appreciate what they have
Hi fat boy slim was bang on when the plane popped up
these days ksi can never be on a bad team cus he is a celebrity
If VIK doesn’t get into the good team I am going to make sure the video gets down voted
Tooooo long to be able to actually watch it all, I have a life I can’t watch something for 3 hours 🤣
1:16:01 Woman gives Harry her underwear and then he sniffs it 1:16:15
Actual music playing 😁
Wish there was more footage of the boys in the cabin
KSI is actually insufferable
1:00:00 plunjide does the obstacle course 😂
Absolutely fantastic!! Great Sidemen Movie!!
2:16:41 never laughed so hard 😂😂
Homeless people watching this:☠️
nahhh felt so bad for the guy in the bus
Loved the ending. That was great.
the one true winner is John for travelling to the Maldives and Swiss Alps in the same week
You know about the finnish sauna😉
9:30 Nah that's too far tho , hope that fan took it in a funny way
NAH HARRY TOOK A WHIFF OF THAT SOCK
Nah lowkey ksi had no business being mean to that guy asking for a pic💀
where is the 200$ and 20.000$ places?
in my opinion a bad team should be a bad team... they shouldn't have any nice food, given any fun tasks etc they should literally.   because how is eating nice pizza, doing a few easy tasks a bad team 😂😂
that ski instructor was so funny, if heeds to do a 20 vs1
This must've been the big shoot Josh said Harry and him couldn't miss if they went to Capetown
How r the editors using copyrighted music in this video? I thought the video gets claimed if we do that. Someone explain pls.  Also jj using micro-aggression throughout the vid like a kid that learnt a new word sent me😂😂😂
Thanks nick ama grind hard
Fantastic vid
1:00:00 The first look at the new Miles Morales movie 😂
❤ what a video
Longer than movies😂
Harry sniffing the sock is priceless
2:58:00 Harry on the bad team at the end will have been fantastic
simon vanished after switching of jj and harry? honestly better for him
Omg 😂😂😂 Harry “THE WHITES OF MY EYES WENT YELLOW I GOT SCARED BRO I don’t WANNA DRINK ANYMORE😭😭”
Sidemen really are the goats of youtube
did we already know jj doesnt stay with them overnight on the bad teams or?
Atleast vik making big bread than most of them 😊
53:19
Well done guys! This video was absolutely incredible!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
bro KSI's putting on pounds
They should do a sleepover
1:36:44 Micro Aggression towards Vik 😢😢😢
jj and ethan are built like retired brazilian footballers
i knew it that KSI will be in a good tema because he will forfeit if he was in bad team,spoiled bratt,he forgot where he came from ,and forget how to be humble.
1:01:38 OH LORD hahahah
Felt like a movie ended when the credits started rolling in. Editing was on point, especially that bridge scene.
1:52:15 harry “ehhh, what’s happening bro” killed me off😂😂😂
ksi letting team down by being spoilt brat
Vik is such a moaning spoilt brat
Unreal. Keep it up!!
nah jj calling a fan an npc and making fun of his phone is a big L
46:39
Best video in ages
Weird ending.. felt really like a movie with the casting and all
Sidemen just don't like Vikkstar123 except Harry. It's obvious
insane production
Jesus 3 hours, god damn we needed that! Might aswell compete with Dune 2 at Oskars
Ethan laughs like a minecraft character consuming a piece of cooked beef LMAOO 💀😭 great video alreadyy
What a video!!!
Vik offering Harry support by running into them on the mountain did not help Harry 😂😂😂😂
fatboy slim for the intro song was legendary
Finally Ethan’s on a good team 🔥🔥🔥
1:18:07 he is fat Agen sir fatneek is back
What a wholesome video. Really made my day seeing them having so much fun together even though they're in the bad team🙂
Best sidemen video in a long time!!
2:50:26 vik is so wholesome here, I love his reaction 'NOW IT'S A PARTY '
Love videos like this
just watched whole 3hrs of sidemen sunday feels like im in there with the bois god dyaum
That camera on Jj’s head is jokes 😂😂
What a wholesome ending. The Cals and randy actually bringing their moods up after it seeming impossible. Then the nostalgic conversations in the dark cracking us up. Brings back so many fond memories. Thanks sideboys for a banger of a video
harry cant be asked
why tobi always in the good team he is the worst sidemen
Sidemen: Luxury Holiday Vs Holiday most people in the UK still couldn't afford.
Please keep make long videos they are so good
They should do a video where one get the good team and one get the GOOOD team and other team thinks there better
Had to watch this on the tv “Siri clear my schedule”!
the editing has been improved a lot
casually removing 3hrs of my day for the sidemen😭
2:16:55
23:54 ethan lost his colour
Loved the video, except for the part where Zerkaa keeps pushing harry to drink even though he repeatedly tells him how he wants to stop drinking because it's so bad for him
Love how Harry considers them as a group to be 33 years old when it’s actually just Josh and Simon and they aren’t even 33 yet 😂
Great vid!
casper is a legend
Off school to watch this
this is the best video ❤️❤️
40:00 - 40:32 Funniest sidemen moment by far 😭
40:25 that catch was slickk
Ksi looks like a aunty when he lets his dreads down 🤣
All the people who saw the whole video 👇🏻
3hours was the best
W❤❤❤❤
jj's face cam made me laugh good
Ksi put on weight
1:16:18 not Harry smelling the sock 😭😭
Ethans "haha" pointing at JJ being fat.....😂😂😂
When they did that moresidemen video JJ was the only one who said he genuinely hates being on the bad team so I suppose he’d technically be suffering more than anyone else if he was on the bad team but only because he’s the most dramatic mf in the United Kingdom 🤡😂
what happened to Kon the cameraman  where is he
Harry smelling the strangers sock🤦🏾‍♂️😂
KSI done put on some pounds there big fella
2:59
vikk carried this one fr
Harry and his cheese is a vibe
yo from now vik is my favorite sdmn..dunoo
The production of these guys is unmatched 🔥🔥
4:33 "bro like their's normal people in their" 💀💀
I walk up mountains that big from sea level😂
3hr????😳😳
the ending was so wholesome all the boys just turned into 12y/os at a sleepover
Did it need to be 3 hours tho
Ethan lookin like Rocket Man
nahhh simon always on bad team man
i bet they’ll defend jj’s insufferable behavior with a “its content init”
Vikkkkkkkkkkk
I wish in the future they bring Phil and Caspar together in a video.
Where is Kon recently  he would ve had so much fun
Harry dont deserve the good team
Skipped three lectures to watch this  Absolutely Worth It
wish we got more content with the troops but its always good to see them on vids!
1:16:16 why he smelled the sock lol
Jj is definitely acting on that zip line, he did the Dubai one loving it, so he is absolutely acting for content! But I'll take 3hrs of content all day! Haha but for 3hrs there ent much lol
how do ppl have the audacity to say beta squad is better than the sidemen
3 hours sheesh
I might be called overly sensitive for this, but I literally had tears in my eyes when no one voted for vik and the disappointment on his face literally broke my heart. It’s not just that but unlike others, despite being on the cheap team he is soo positive and embraces the experience. He literally carried the whole cheap team.  It hurts to see someone so kind and positive being treated like that 😭😭
14:04 lol
2:46:00 the real content
33:20 JJ confirmed cat of the group 😂
this is so sick. better than a movie. The intro 😍🤩
1:03:25 for all the girlies
I Like the new style of editing with the songs and stuff. Enhances the quality of the over video. Big up the sidemen editors. 👍
The older I get the more like VIK I become. @Zerkaa get that man on the GOOD team.
why was ksi and ethan and tobi so mean to their fans smh
I like this camera
1:16:19 NAHH MAN.. HARRY SMELLING THE WOMAN'S SOCK😭😭
Well spent 3 hrs🔥🔥❤
As a 21 year old woman Harry and Vikk and Simon’s fits were actually awesome!  They’re fun and not really as silly as they made them sound even for men
This must have taken lots of planning , hats off to the team
2:42:38 vikk
2:16:41 careful guys there’s a titan on the loose 😂
unreal
its 3 hrs bro(:_:)
3HRSSSS???
End of the video is actualy so amazing, need a sidemen roadtrip across continents or something
Don’t think JJ could last one round in the ring now. He’s a big boy now 😂
Harry had 14 million subs when he did the bad holiday in london. Now, he has 16.4 without uploading a bloody video. Harry doesn't deserve this!
Man!! the intro was crazy 🔥🔥
BEST SIDEMEN VIDEO TO DATE
I don't care what anyone says.... Ethan is an absolute beast.
Nah JJ was so HILARIOUS this video🤣🤣
This might go down as one of my favourites 3hrs of sidemen, and the production quality was crazy ! Big ups boys ! 🎉
WHO teaches the class here vikk? - Casper   😂😂
guys, ksi always on the good team. hes always complaining like bro, living like normal people isnt a punishment. kinda disgusting behaviour ngl
Finally finished the video... the fellas coming at the end made the bad team more fun
everyone thought ethan was cursed with bad teams but it was actually vik the whole time
what a Video
The credits were amazinggggg 👏👏👏
3 hours is crazy
3 hours???
good on ya boys, the amount of energy and time this video mustve taken to produce!
Sidemen holiday in the Pacific? Fiji perhaps🥹
I found the "bad team" more entertaining, since the good team only sat in the house.
This was epic lol, poor Vic and JJ😂
Vikk deserved better.
1:02:21 josh being sneaky af 👀👀
Cashper verry funny yar 👏😂
banger video
I feel bad for the guy that asked to take a picture
Major props to the film crew on this one, learning to ski and film at the same time must have been tough!  Licensed music in a Sidemen video! Awesome video boys!
This had to be the best sidemen Sunday yet
2:02:48 Tobi seems to be having a great time
When im waiting for the sidemen to drop there new sunday video and i see its a holiday one 🥳🎉
NICE 3h !! :D
Did I just watch a 3 hour sidemen Sunday at 3am to 6am when I have work later? Yes.. yes I did
I like the way James shoots his videos
Everytime JJ is in the bad team " IM TOO RICH FOR THIS" HAHAHAHAHA
great video
36:35 No one gonna talk abt Minters fod
Where are they what town
Bro why tf is the intro music my dads alarm clock sound
This is the best video ever
nahhhh 1:16:20 im sorry harry your my guy but we cant let that slide hahaha
Hi
Today's my birthday and sidemen dropped this movie, I watched it in one go today itself, I don't no I should be happy or sad:) .. but mostly happy
I like Ethan's hair blonde I think it'll look even better if he died his beard brown
I knew josh would be cooking something when he announced that he'll be hosting on his vlog
Chelsea willie 🤣🤣
Ksi is embarassing...
2:16:39 could have watched 3 hours of just that
3hrs video lesh gooo
Production quality is crazy
Cashper was the funniest part 😂 loved this video!
37:30 not JJ checking that lady out
Nah man, They really dont like my man Vik
Ending minute or two was the best thing I have seen in a while.
Harry running on the bridge with the 360 camera was the funniest part of this video 😂 this hands just flapping around
25:32 Tobi is great, but this would be hilarious
JJ's forehead cam is just another violation 🤣
The change in Viks mood as soon as hi saw the troops😭😂poor fella had the hardest internal breakdown
How come they can use 24k magic without getting copyright striked 😂
I'm not surprised Harry knows where the best snow is lol
the forehead cam
THREE HOURSSS??? THATS CRAZY love it
The editor of this vid 👍
Finally a vacation episode
They really added the sht out of this 🫤 ads every 30 sec 20+ sec unskippeble
Vik never got a good team...its aweful 😅😅😅
MiniWinter
The ending was Wholesome ❤
1:16:50 gettin flliped mid rock paper scissors is madddd🤣🤣
Can we get a counter for how many times JJ says “micro aggression” in the video
i literally feel bad for my men vik and simon 🥺🥺...... they really waiting for a time to be in a good team
Future sidemen sunday should be them vs the gladiators 😂😂
2:21:57 the coincidental comedic timing of Behz saying he loves fireworks, just to be attacked by one right after 😂
Two grown successful men having a serious conversation about other grown successful men's wangs....only on Sidemen..
Nobody voted for vik its time for him to leave 😅😅😅
JJ is so spoiled and ungrateful at times, it’s irritating.
Damm vik looks so disappointed really feel bad for him he get nothing good out of this good and bad videos.  Edit i wish vik host one video where he send josh,jj,tobi to bad team vik villian ark.
If I was on the 'bad team' with my friends it would be one of the best trips ever 😅
The amount of work put into these videos are nuts
Harry deffo fainted on the gondola
josh traumatised them soo bad that they speculated everything🤣
Need to do a road trip very soon as well
WHEN SIDEMEN X STORROR VIDEO???
Make KSI host a holiday video
i think they are making a movie now like what a good and such good scenes man like what is going on here
3 hr banger!! wow
55:12 aw good for harry bless him
Op video
1:16:19 harry taking a sniff had me dying
Harry being depressed on the bad team *joins good team Harry becomes depressed on the good team 😂😂😂
vik energy change at the end when the boys came. i love it
1:38:58  New phil
I need more cashpur 😭 man’s hilarious
Please make some original idea content I don’t want to see 3 hour videos I’ve got things to do
aw cute ending
1:17:45 nigerians going back to their roots
More vids like this pleaseee
Sidemen have been killing it lately
3hrs     wtf
1:16:19 HARRY SNIFFING THE SOCK LMAOOO
Sidemen are washed now, they actually think there better than everyone it’s jarring
great video!
Ending credits they getting fancy now
The production and the editing was on next level
Ksi kinda snobby
"Zis iz ze mountainz,  we must respect ze mountainz. Zey require schwere bollenz"
3h long lunch imma need a ambulance nearby 😂
seeing a sidemen video with actual songs in it is so chill
The fact that KSI actually did PISS and freezy replied to randy the water tastes like PISS ..😭😭😭😭
Why’s vik always singled out
Poor vik
JJ clowning the guy on the bus asking for a picture made me pause the vid and rethink my life choices
OMG it’s Cashpur
What other video has Casper been in?
Atleast Ethan got to be with Harry and JJ got to be with Simon. It was pretty obvious it would turn out like that. Ether it's a draw or one person gets no vote
I’ve never seen someone not fit in as much as Vikk does
Id watch a Sidemen vs Josh any day!
absolute tune at 2:04:23 🫡
The three hours only felt like one
WHAT A VID !!!! I HOPE VIKK AND SIMON ALSO GET ON A GOOD TEAM  I feel its been a long time since we have seen them in GOOD TEAM & KSI in BAD Team = BANGERR!!!
What a banger
1:02:22 😂🤣🤣harry😂
Why was Simon not there during the start of the lessons? 😂
1:16:15 didn't know Harry was into that...
If Only all your videos were this long
3 hour sidemen sunday is MENTAL
This video shows why Vikk is my favorite! 💛
As a ski instructor this was an interesting watch lmao.
Once again Vik and Ethan not on the same team, what a surprise
can we get the soundtrack for this video lol, actually good to see money being put into getting licensed music
Such a good vid
How they get away with all the copyright music?
Best sidemen sunday 😂😁
I can’t be ask.
This is the most wholesome video/movie ever. ABSOLUTE BANGER.
Justice for VIK
The best 3 hours of my life
Absolute banger 🔥
I feel bad for vik 😢
the German "instructor'' was cringe AF
Brother, 3 hours, Holy.
It's always the bad team have the best and last laugh that makes these videos priceless ❤️
@zerkaa good job mate,absolute banger. Every fan loves this kinda videos they are the best❤️
A 3 hour sidemen sunday video???? Ooooh my monday is starting off amazing 😃😃😃😅
Sidemen take the piss with the amount of ads
I love that we get a longer video to enjoy🎉
I will get most liked comment...
2:16:40 Harry's titan run 😂
Ksi saying hes like Karl Pilkington, so what hes saying... is, he's the idiot abroad??
Absolute masterpiece of a video!!!!!!
Ngl video ends once JJ joined the bad team… watchinf Harry & Simon suffer was the best part of the video… poor vik tho 😢
Why is KSI always in a good team?
1:16:19  why smell it tho😭😭
1:16:27 there is no way bog has just sniffed a minors dirty sock, outrageous
john be sat like a cuck watching them eat XD
how am i supposed to eat a 3 hour meal, my stuff gettin cold
Ksi is so jarring when joining a normal holiday coach. Like shut up it’s fine lol
My emotions throughout this video...😂--🙁--😂--🙁
kasper saved the video
Bro I feel so bad for Vik. They always do him so damn dirty 😢
This vid was fire asf W!!
The cheap teams first outfits went absolutely HAAAARD
That team switch was class
A+ production!!
3 hour sidemen video god damn
1:18:25 the fatttttneeeeeekkk is backkkkkkk
DUDE the number of times Vik is just dragged down by these guys is nuts. Must have felt horrible to not get a single vote to switch over to the good team.
I think that’s the best ending to a sidemen video ever
1:26:32 their reaction is so satisfying 😂😂😂
What a nice video it was some of the best 3 hours i have spent. And nice twist to swap pepole around. Keep going guys much love😂❤
2:16:40 what in the Attack on Titan is this 😭
i feel very bad for vik...😞
3 hrs of Sidemen Sunday video 🥹🥹🥹 am I in heaven??
The king Josh is back with a master class
I was about to say. Having Ksi on another loser team would be absolutely criminal
2:58:05 I rather these moments than what the expensive teams doing
Expensive vs cheap vs 1 sidemen would actually be lit
33:48 I like Simon because of these😅
Ethan laughs like tickle me Elmo
2:16:41 the hell i just watched😂😂
What’s that number guessing game they played at the end? I’m clueless
This felt like a movie!!!
When Ethan, Tobi and JJ take the group photo and JJ kicks his leg out 😂 such a cutie
The way harry got that socks and then he was trying to sniff it hahaha
What an amazing sidemen Sunday, Well done Zerkaa
so this is the life after losing to tommy fury
To be honest, I am a little surprised that JJ didn't and or couldn't buy the whole house for himself as his full on new home, or as a new Sidemen house.
Is this SIDEMEN THE MOVIE
Simon going at zerka was funny af
The Josh and Ethan snowboarding and skiing part of the video was made so well, I don't think I have ever felt so grateful to see content like that before. Kudos to the Sidemen and their crew for that. The part I'm talking about is at 2:04:23 - 2:05:16 .  Honestly the editing in this video has been superb and has made the 3 hour 100% worth it.
💕👍
2:16:29 harry🤣🤣
Absolutely loved this ❤
Winter holiday on march is wild
Nah, Harry whining like a little girl "having" to do some tasks a place not many people can afford is mental. Just ruins the video
33:20  Yep WE can guess why. Not much experience with it yeah!
i'd love to see a sidemen sunday where both are convinced they're in the bad team and end up in the same place together both as the good team, vibes would be so good from them all
Bezinger is getting in trouble 😂
1:23:55 we staan er weer goed op jongens
Obviously, the Indian .... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Absolutely loved this ❤
top tier video as always LEGENDS
W ZERKAA VIDEO, THANKS FOR THIS AWESOME MOVIE!!
Tobi disappearing both nights🤨 Great content
JJ on the bus was bang out of order, those guys probably save up for ages to enjoy that. He's too forced these days it's cringe
Harry just got a pity vote to go to the good team should have swapped tobi and vik.
a movie an a half
2:13:00 beauty
Damn JJ in bulking season again
Vik completely lost it when they were walking up the mountain after skiing 😂
This gonna get demonetized for showing that cigar
this is fking cinema
KSI acting like a 4 year old every time he doesn't get his way is getting old now.
2:16:40
1:18:24 WOAH ETHAN
Top class video. This reminds me a bit of the old school Top Gear adventures!
2:16:39 is the funniest thing ever! XD
Nah but why did harry sniff the sock
The only thing I don’t like about these videos is how sore a winner jj is
3h, Perferct to wake up to!
1:38 woah
Wasnt sure if i was gonna make it through the whole 3 hr video in one go (i usually take a break on their long videos) but this one was such a banger that i got through the whole thing
25:40 justice for vikstarrrrr 😢
2:16:45
love the Top Gear special-esque outro
Vikk deserves a banger good team holiday
2:7:55 jj with boogers🤧🤧
2:16:40 didn't know calfreezy was on this vid!
3 hours of pure fuuuun!
JJ is fat
24:31 harry positive thinking as always 😂
Funniest bit of the whole vid 2:58:05
Hazard is definitely packing more than kante let's be real
Sidemen Sunday videos worth of 3 days!!! let's go!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is a peice of art beautifully executed video
So glad Harry was on the bad team...knock his ego down a few pegs
When was vikks last time on the good team? 😂
JJ just learned what the phrase micro aggression 😂
23:48 Harry complaining and the clips moves to the good team balling! haha
Breakfast,lunch,dinner sorted 1hr each😂
Feel for Vik ❤️ Give him the Good Team Josh BC
What are we gonna do when they stop making vids aint nobody doin this youtube shiii like the sidemen
How long did it take to upload a 3 hour video ? How big was the video file?
What's with harry and his lowercase screams?
I love opening Youtube and having an absolute banger of a sidemen sunday to watch!!
The fact that Vik lost so many rock paper scissor is unbelievable 😂😂
fatneek is back
Just let poor harry watch his video xD
absolutely love this video 10/10 fs favourite moment was the boys sleepover
To be honest the camera crew didn’t do justice to the views. Just the cheap team whining all day. Well except the ending part which was wholesome.
I loved this format of video
2 Days, so much content man
1:26:00 demonic snores
W 3 hour video
Harry : 29:47  Me : Gladly!
Why Tobi is in the good team all the time??😐😂😂😂
A 3 hour sidemen sundaym i came
2:12:45 what a shot Www
Bro got strength of a gorilla 🦍
We need more of Casper in Sidemen videos 😂
Banger
A 3 hour video with 3 million views in less than a day is insanity 💀
More of casper please 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I want to watch this but it’s 3 hours long man 😢😢
1:16:18 HARRY SNIFFED IT😭😭
JJ gives me second hand embarrassment so often 😂😂
Why harry acting like he dosent drink when bro drinking off camera ?
I’ll do one push up for every like this comment gets
this one goes down in history
the troops sleepover >
The instructor on the bad team made it 😂
fatneek
Casper terrorising jj 😂
“I’m too rich for this” jjs not humble in the least bit
2:16:39 Harold if he was in attack on titan
Bro bangger 😂
the drone shots went crazy this video mad respect to the person controlling it
When we saw jj on the zip line why did it look so green screened when we saw the pov of jj
Anyone know the piano music to the background music at 30:34
I hope they keep "bullying" vik so all his stans from the LGBTQ community🌈🫵 would cry more. They all cringe🤡
KSI IS FAT AGAIN LMAOOO
O god jj's reddit will murder him for losing his packs
I don't what they're thinking but KSO doesn't deserve to be in the good team out of all people!
I was hoping there was 1 vote for Vik, 1 for Harry, and 1 for Simon so they all got to go to the good team and JJ was stuck on the bad by himself
I know jj is everyone's favourite, but he just seems so up himself like everyone else is an ant and shouldn't even look at him... I get he made this fame and doesn't need to try as hard... but all he does now is show up on and off and be a spoilt 🍆.... he could at least fake being happy to do videos/see fans
Nah vik is him . HE got the guy to carry him
3 hours let’s gooooo
this was amazing
Harry saying he hates Denmark 💀💀💀💀💀
29:40 Vik's positivity is so refreshing as I could imagine if ksi heard that he would be screaming is lungs out saying "I am too rich for this" 😂
everything ive been needing in a sidemen sunday, crying rnnnn more more josh thank youuu
i wanna go skiing :(
best sidemen sunday ever
Rcb❤❤❤ escn
9:00 Poor Guy just wanted a picture
Josh is a great host for these videos
Why didn't they do the course on the rock climbing wall correctly, they just picked their own path? :(
Big banger
"SEE YA LATEER NPC'S"
Naah 3 hours video is crazyyyyy
MORE KSI ON THE BAD TEAM PLEASE 😂😂
The glacier 3000 bridge scene is just 🤌🤌🤌🤌
The ending with Callux, Freezy, and Randolph felt like the ending to an old coming of age movie.
just realised this video is 3h long :D
Gotta love the long videos from our favourite boys on YouTube ❤️
KSI should be on the bad team, vik needs to be on the good team such a trooper from last week
jj went from ripped to this again like rah
Noone talking about how the cameramen were absolute units skiing while holding cameras
1:25:18 i expected the phrase "good morning sleepy heads" by ryan 😭😂
Production, cost efficiency, raw entertainment and a dedicated crew. Josh is the underrated goat.
Production on these vids are nuts now I love it
JJ going back to fat neek era
Genuinely excellent video
We gotta see a collab with the outdoor boys
Ksi the man with an IPhone called someone an hoc for having a better phone than him 😂
A three hour Sidemen Sunday. What a treat! 😊
W ending
Casper out her rizzin vik
It's interesting how easy KSI can gain weight 1:07:45
Harry's been lookin hella attractive nowadays ngl. Full homo
this is peak of peak
Why does Jj scream bro😭they make him act like he doesn't live this life already off camera😂😂
1:16:20 No he did not 😂😂!!!!!!!!
i love vikk sm :(
"Water is 2 atoms" - JJ
This was a certified banger!
I think they made it 2024 banger🎉
the way Harry sniffed the sock had me laughing like a mad man XD
Great video but I don't know about the switch, would've preferred if they actually used the wheel. Only one team actually voted for who to switch but everyone on the bad team was set on Jj switching. Overall good video just felt effy about the switch
I would have been surprised if jj was on bad team😅😅😅😅
Honestly props to Vikk because he kept the vibes up for the bad team from the beginning. . Love JJ and the tantrums were funny at first but he is insufferable when he doesent get a luxurious team. Man needs to be humbled  To be fair though , Vikk also completely lost it in the final parts😂
40:17 every flipping time
Ksi is such a vibe would be really great travelling with him ❤️❤️
Why expose the teams in the thumbnail that’s my question
Ksi is fat again 😊
3 hr videoooo🤯🤯🥳🥳🥳 this will last me 3 days of meals
What an absolute banger of a video. The music in this video was INSANE. Drizzy Drake, Gorillaz and Coldplay???
02:16:40 This angle is everything
A 3 hour sidemen video? I couldn’t even imagine a sidemen video this long with this high production quality. Who would have thought this 10 years ago. Very well deserved
The iconic YES YES YES from KSI
Absolute masterpiece
Wait iv never seen anyone rock climb without looking at their feet 💀
Two weeks, two great vids keep it up lads
Fatneek is back 😂
2:43:48 nooo ethan mate... Not on camera 😅
the suspension bridge was by far the best photography of the video have out done yourselves i don't know how josh tops this video
Sidemen treat Vik like this and then will vote that Vik is the most cruel one😂.
Took me 8 hours to watch this
VIK is the GOAT 🔥🔥🔥
very good video would like to see more of this production level
1:39:31 Sidemen Villain Entrance done right!!
the new camera is really good
The sleepover vibes at the end was PEAK!
Holy shit, a 3 hour Sidemen Sunday. This is gonna be a good year
3h movie?
FREEZY CAL AND RANDYYY YESS
JJ is such a mood lmaooo
Vikk nd Harry together is all I need! Another banger! ❤
Tbh $200 guys had more fun thah the $20000 ones
1:24:50 Harry: 'give them a kiss goodnight' Vik: 😘 Harry: 'that was a bit weird' 😂
“Harry, lose the cheese”
Woah... it's literally a movie! 😅
3 hours video….And still managed to get over 2M views🙌🏻
I went here in December and it’s so cool seeing them go where I went
That intro is cold ❄
18:13 The Edit tho 🤌
The troops actually did make the cheap teams night so much better, they’re such good sports
I haven't seen Ethan laugh that hard since A-clouds beatbox on Sidemen got talent.
9:00 that NPC part 😭😭😭
1:17:47 Ethan and JJ making random noises In the sauna   JJ 3 seconds later starts humming the halo video game theme
KSI is so fat did he eat Tommy Fury?
it took me 2 days to watch this one and i loved it
Josh da for blessing us with a 3 hour video 🔥
Everyone doesn't like vik issit?
Tobi is a Nice Guy  But he brings literally nothing in videos
love this movie style editing. the end credits really made me giddy for yall for some reason
jj is kinda getting stale over the years privileged and just boring sorry
Intro music was like being on a ESF football tournament when the trophies are being revealed
This video was sooo good, the montages, the BTS literally everything. Felt a rollercoaster of emotions. BIG UP ZERKAA 🫶🏾
bro that was soooo good. laughed SO hard so many times hahahha
finally a long vid 3 hrs is great oasdjgl gaűspogjdsglja gjasékldjglasjdgő asjgkaldsh aslkhdgjadslgjléjk  big up the sidemen alkjdgh
Aweee, vik is the best. love his attitude.
BANGER AFTER BANGER
Fatneek is coming back!!!!!!!! 1:18:25
They may have been on the good team but wtf are those outfits 😂
#StopHarryAlcoholism
The fact that the bad team holiday is better then any good holiday I’ve ever been in is crazy
That cabin on the mountain when they woke up in the morning 😍 it’s actually such a beautiful place 😮 just needs a bit of work inside 😅
9min in vid already a banger🔥 GOATS🐐 OF YOUTUBE NO 🧢
Damn masterpiece
If the people on the buss is not paid actors and is just going ok vacation. They are experiasing a rich guy complaining about the vacation they have been looking forward to😂
Josh is literally the best host ❤🔥
Great video boys🎉
a fuckin banger this one.. sidemen sundays these days are just so wholesome and fun to watch..josh really created another masterpiece!!
This goes in the top 10 sidemen videos of all time. Certified banger!
This movie is elite
6:01 Theo Campell lol. I forget that Love Island is really popular in the UK but I only know about him from The Challenge.
3 HOURS 😮😮❤
"come va-jay-jay!"
Harry had a sniff 😂
A 3hr sidemen video is a heart healer ❤
i dont care what anyone says holiday videos are the best sidemen videos of all time!
a whole movie was produced today by the sidemen 😭
Vik at glacier 3000 skiing would have been 🤌
When they said they made the best video ever last week they were not lying ❤️🫵🏽
Need callux on a vid
Video Intro is dope🥰
this is the best youtube video i have ever watched you guys have taken youtube content next level
Vik actually had me laughing the most this vid, carried it imo 😂
43:35 *looks a bit autestic there i reckon*
our fatneek is back 🤣🤣🤣
These man actually made a movie
In one of these videos, they should have the entire bad team and good team switch. 😂
Nah, Harry was too good for a first time skier!!!
So Harry has liver Issues . Everyone should stop drinking btw
I Think Vik actually volunteers for the bad team because he actually likes being on it.
2:16:48 wtf, my night paralysis demon
Why are Vik stans so deranged
Vik got done bad again 😅
Bro this video was crazy good, do more this long please!!
huuuuuuuge W!!🔥🔥
3 hours 🎉🥳
I just wanna say that Vikk and Simon were great in this video!
3hours damn
2:12:45 This is insane.
the camera crew should aslo be shuffled so it’s not obvious who’s bad team and who’s good
3hours?😢😂❤
18:15 this scene hits different cause at the same time I see news abt bruno mars having gambling debt
tobi is the most wholesome 🥹
I LOVE it when jj is on the bad team
Do a video with the beta Squad
Greatest sidemen sunday of all time! You get more fun content with the Cheap team which made this whole thing great. Props to Vik for being a good sport and making everything optimistic even in bad times.
Honestly loved that last part. Reminds me of those good ole friends sleepovers
Vik constantly getting overlooked has me pissed frfr
big ups to the film crew who had to snowboard and film as well
4:30" bro there's like normal people on there"💀
Amazing production
I never knew joshs last name was bradley. Or viks last name was barn. And i thought minter was just simons alias instead of his last name. Ive been watching the boys since like 2016 or something, back before they moved into the first sidemen house i think, and i just never thought about it till i saw the credits roll. Dang.
good team always looks so boring
This is legit a movie
Jj and ethan doesn’t deserve the good team..these mf needs to suffer
2:04:00 Sdmn having existential awe...
Love the concept ... can make it into episode vibes like find what happened next .. next sunday!!!!
3 hour movie
1:12:12 what have i witnessed
Favorite moment of the whole video by far 2:10:27 😂
one of the best vids
Live your life to the fullest guys❤
Can’t lie, stinker
this think gave a documentary vibe. It like when you become 60-70 yrs old would look back and seeing adventures and  amazing time you have with you brothers. They are being mad about this but this is dream for every man to be enjoying life and  having adventures with his mates.
Omg pls we need more 3 hr sidemen Sundays I’m sure I’m not the only one thinking this 😂😂😂
someone needs to edit vikk @ 1:53:01 as the xix logo
16:00 😂😂😂
Makes me sad how it seems like most of the boys don’t like Vik that much, aside from Harry
Expensive vs. cheap vs. josh would be lit 😂😂😂 Do it in America 😂😂😂
Coldplay playing in the background while panning in the summit is so chill!
I loved the credits You boys should number all the sidemen sundays and partner with a streaming website for a limited series and put all of them on there.
Harry did not just sniff the sock. 1:16:20
Has jj lost touch or something? He had a face like a bursted boot when sledging on the ice. It’s not like he was gonna go back to a $20,000 lodge or anything
1:01:39 and a new meme is created :D
JJ takes a piss Calfreezy: drinks river water "Tastes like pure piss, they are near"💀💀💀💀
I got a good meal, opened youtube and saw this. Life is good.
Nahhh, not the sleep over nostalgia at the end, sick video lads
This is the new longest sidemen Sunday
This video was by far one of the best sidemen Sundays they’ve put out recently
Vik is so unfunny , how is he in the sidemen 🤣
another banger of 2024
3 hour sidemen Sunday, we are blessed
LOVE THIS
Cool vid except for randy having to make jokes on Jesus cuz he's contentless any other way. Funny how it's never about other religious figures
Casper is so funny 🤣
The use of actual chart music is so nice.  If you lot did a video like this once a month and that was it I think everyone would be happy
JJ is so annoying 😂😭
Harry ccmplains about the tasks but also hosts them a 100% 😂
Id says viks team was the better team since they literally became famous at the city while ksi's team enjoyed their room in seclusion
Amazing video. One of the best ever 🧡
The NPC arc went crazy
casper is something else
3 hours??!! Insaneee
Theres got to be hundreds of hours of footage and to cut it down to 3 hours makes it feel like they maximised everything they could
Why was this video so long but had very less content, they literally just went to the hotels and did skiing 3 hrs for this the Europe version was better than this crap
This was sooooo epic!!! Loved the troops bringing fresh content at the end.
I’d love to see a picture of the editing timeline, must be crazy
This this trio is best Simon vikk and JJ 🫶🏾❤👍🏾
I get that jj was showing off but when he gets it bad they show off too , they should appreciate jj he made all their careers expect harrys
This video was actually soooooo good! Good job boys!!
3 hours sidemen, this gonna be some good dinner
Hey @Sidemen you should do a  holiday in Fiji one day
33:24 the lama hair is back?
3 hours daaaamn!!!
2:12:08 my thighs are burning 😂😂😂😂
Is this the big shoot josh keep mentioning on the "get the furthest in 24hrs"
justice for vikk
man just made a movie
1:10:00  Ethan -  "do you know any French?"  Ksi - " yeah, va va voom " 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Va va voom
Absolute banger❤
Yet again JJ is on the good team, what a suprise
someone give my man vikk a good holiday 😭
Probably the best video of all time, mostly because it was the longest video, especially a Holiday one
No one gonna talk about the lasers on everyone’s head outside the pizza shop
JJ mad disrespectful
3 hours let's goooo
ksi weak as always
43:51 listen to this with your eyes closed 💀
Get Vikk in good team and Tobi in bad team as a default next time. we want that
Wicked video 👍🏻
This is a fucking movie
Brother am I the only 1 who thinks that they putting some bangers and they have rights for that too
W intro
We love thisss, 3 hours WWWW
Yo at 2:50:37 did Vik poor out Randy’s shot like a big f u or something
21:48
The best part is simen and vikk still being in there ski jumpers at the end.
the night talk was like the best part.
34:05
3 HOURS??? I LOVE SIDEMEN!
❤❤❤❤
Done ✅.. W video 😂
Can we have a KSI and Cashper special please? 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
the production is next level
Why did Harry smell the sock?!😭😭
such a banger
W
the longer videos are the best
Fqing 3 video Let's goooo!!!
Love KSI! No matter good team or bad team he still knows how to entertain and make us laugh 🫶🏻
1:33:21 yearh JJ hahah
49:16  HARRY’S FACE KILLED MEEE 💀💀
Why is simon mot with vik and jj ?
I’m watching this in one sitting… I’ll update u guys if I did it  I forgot to update  u guys... i did finish it in one sitting and it was amazing, this is arguably one of the best sidemen Sundays
Does ksi have adhd ??
imagine a video with cashpan and Phil, one yelling at JJ, the other making JJ feel better  Phil v Caspan boot camp
we are going to sükalyämoms 6:25
3hrs amazing
3h of sidemen content!
vik is actually the most poor soul
Yo guys everyone roast me as bad as u can. Let’s see how it goes 😂
KSIVik   Let's see if there's a redemption arc (from their last horribly failed challenge)
1:15:04 I think I'm in love
1:30:38 switcharu time
4:30 jj called us normal like he is a GOD or something 🤣🤣🤣
I want t be in a video please
I don't know if I've cackled so much watching a sidemen video. This was amazing boys, great job!
what an absolute banger for the intro music
Vik constantly complaints, it get annoying sometimes, making the whole team toxic, ❤ Vik maybe he is sick
This is why they asked how long a sidemen Sunday should be 💀😂
"I hate Denmark, personally" I knew Harry was a man of culture!
vik is on the bad team everytime and then they wonder why he's always on holiday man needs to recuperate
I remember when gg used to be fun all the time
Shock Jjs never on the bad team 🤔
1:16:19 why did harry sniff the sock 😭
The last minute of the videos was the best 😂😂
i wish i could log this on letterboxd. five stars btw.
Harry running like a titan got me dying
that was the longest dinner i've ever had in my life
bože, tohle řvaní kdyby předvedl v mojem autobuse , tak už po něm řvu.
Why does Vik in the wole video planning about anyone's murder 😂
best sidemen sunday ever?
I’m done with these fake room reactions so dead
That camera man on the skis is smooth with it
8:58😂
Long sidemen vid ok then this like a four course meal and dessert 👍👌👍👌
just got to the intro, absolutely loving the new edit, amazing
Harry sniffing the sock is wild
3 hours thats mad
W SDMN SUNDAY❤‍🔥
Tobi always gets jammy
Coldplay  music  fit in every moment 🥰❤ i love it
I have a feeling the "Random selection" of the teams is purely based on how long/strong a friendship is with someone, it truly should be random smh. Nonetheless, great video, cheap team were jokes and made the video 10x better! 😂😂
I loved it but tbh the end was my favorite part but it felt a little or my just me that felt that way
VIDEO IDEA: They should do a video where both teams are the bad team and neither one knows or both are the good team. I feel like that would be funny!!
3 hrs dammm
Tobi: ✨️"remember jj we are not on the bad team we are on the cheap team"✨️
Why does it seem like JJ is never on the bad team anymore?
Am I the only one that didnt expect Vik’s last name to be barn 😂
3 HOURS, YOU ABSOLUTE LEGENDS
Editor 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Is it just me or ksi is fat
Jj and ethan should be having the worst next holiday based on their behaviour rn
The ending had me out of breath it was so funny very wholesome but vik deserved better guys
I find vik fans cringe ..They are so cringe.
Might be the best sidemen video ever
OMG 3 hrs yessssss I think it's gonna be finger licking godd❤❤❤
That hotel edit goes harddd🔥🔥🔥
Harry got done dirty even after the switch
the image of jj face when climbing is the most cursed thing I've every seen
What a banger! Big Ups Josh!!!
stop the credits please
JJ gave too much negative energy man, It was annoying
Harry was right, each brother is more retarded than the other
2:21:51
2:16:40 had me dying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Let's go....three whole hours long video. That's what we expect from sidemen sunday
1:16:19
1:16:19 wtf is Harry doing 😭😭😭
Casper honestly made the vid hes a goat and next time vik should be on the good team❤❤
Best video
They really despise Vik 😂😂 Every fcking video!
Vik at 8:05 😂💀
Weirdly Simon pulled the outfit off at the beginning 😅
Another Banger
Ofc KSI gets niced again, can't make the cash cow unhappy. Whiny minge.
Dude who gave vik a piggy back ride's fit is tuff
2:16:40 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
3 hour is crazy
Nah man kinda felt bad for vik ya know
Copyright music ? Enjoyed the vid once again fellas 💪🏽
their bad team is still a dream for many people ❤️i love what I have but still man u lots are living ur life I wish I have what u have but gotta stay happy with whatever u have right? still sometimes it's just 💔
W vid
1:00:15 .......what the hell
just finished 3hr long vid after so ages its a banger for sure vik's positivity , simon's pessimistic , harry's never giving up attitude , toby's massage happiness , jj being jj , ethan being happy after months of losing , josh being chicken it was fun see you next sunday
1:16:15  Harry smells the sock given by the lady😂😂😂😂
HE SMELELD THE SOCK 🤣
Good choice of music
3 hrs?  lemme get my movie snack pack up
That clip of Harry on the bridge 😂😂😂😂😂
Longest sidemen Sunday ever  Shout out to Josh the sidemen ❤❤😂😂
Banger
Vik Ethan and tobi gotta be on a good team together cuz they actually appreciate both sides
3 hours, watch endgame nah watch sidemen
Why is the bad team so unbelievably ungrateful 🤣 Like dude
Kasper low key goated at handling JJ
Fu*k i dont want to watch this  anymore  Vik should have been gone to good team😔
1:16:15 bro just smellin the sock
2:58:00 the best ending ever in sidemen vid history no luxury no nothing just the boys having fun
Simon looked so distraught when he saw the house 😢
1:17:50 Ethan and JJ are a vibe
2:16:40 nahh what's this camera angle 😭
JJ and Ethan just screaming over Tobi while he peacefully lays there made me lose it.
What a video!!!!!!! @sidemen hats off (bows down)
2:14:34 My acrophobia went nuts here.😶😖😫
1:25:20 gives me old school top gear vibes
Why did Harry sniff the sock at 1:16:20 🤣🤣
KSI was hella annoying this video
2:13:25 this scene - 😂😂
Tobi, Ethan and Ksi trio looking like a Oreo biscuit
harry tried to smell the sock😭😭
This is the sidemen Movie that was advertised on april 1st.
Randys comedy show was the highlight
Vikk might be a millionaire but I feel bad for him  in the shoots sometimes. He is a genuinely good dude
9:20 aint no way ksi calling a guy with s24 ultra npc 🤣🤣 when that guys phone is more expensive than his iPhones
Very dope video 🔥
1:53:00 Vik finally became the star
41:25 that fan look like messi
This is officially the longest sidemen video ever
That intro :0
18:12 great edit
Glad Vik was able to experience this, even though it was the bad team, without feeling too ill
Y is JJ acting like he has never had better food. He can get this daily.
Chelsea willie😂
I am tired of tobi getting on the good team.
Cashpur is a vibe 😂
Like for a sidemen Sunday Cheap vs expensive but only vik in the good team xd
how much did tobi eat? look at the fuckin size of him now
All vik needs is good true friends.
Honestly Josh has done it again he is the goat of sideman hosts🎉
39:57 pause it
okay before even watching this i already know its a banger
Certified Zerkaa Classic.
1:16:19 did harry just sniff the sock...
Honestly i think the teams are being picked on who does and doesn't drink alcohol always seems to be the bad team doing the drinking challenges, im only an hour in and i feel for the bad team having to deal with Tobi and JJ always getting the good teams
why tobi always in the good team
I like the vibes of this video less hardcore edits more calm and day in a life vibes
1:1647
Harry smelling a woman’s sock😭😭😭 no one talking about this??
3hr banger da boys cooked. They definitely upped the levels this yr
this is the Sidemen Movie
2:14:00 that's a cool a** shot
harry thats nastay1:16:18
Everyone: “KSI has yes men surrounding him” The yes men: 1:06:05
Cheap team is deo lots of fun to watch
congratulations on this fuckin masterpiece 👏👏👏👏👏🤌👌
Deffs the best Sidemen Holiday Video💯💯 audio at the end was the best 😂😂
18:20 whoever edited this part they need some raise
The vibes at the end of the bad team seemed immaculate!! 😂
$200....bruh that's my dads monthly salary 💀
2:55:50 Why Jesus sounding like Michael Jackson?
Just insane🔥
The ski i structor was HILARIOUS! Good job on his part
The fact that there is timestamps in the comments for more than 2 hours into the vid is crazy banger content
go back to 40 minutes
lova ya Vicky boy ! just keep being you  ♥
5:25 just video started and jj be like im too rich for this 🤣🤣🤣
Maybe it was just editing lolz
#JusticeForJohn
I love how the bad team went to bed first
Such a great video, ending was wholesome. the end Credits felt like a movie. Josh never disapoints the fans with banging vidz great work Sidemen and the Crew.
This would of been such a good bud if the bad teams vibe wasn’t dead
Last 15 minutes were goated
24:30 *W2S leans back and breths out*  Everyone: "helicopter helicopter"
2.3 mill views in 9 hours! You guys never stop bringing the absolute top content!   Shoutout to josh. Without josh these travel videos would never be as good
1:50:14, yeah
Just seen lux clicking off ✌🏽
JJ`s face when the fan asked for a photo 🤣🤣
@bhezinga he's games was fire do more
So, can we have an official "Biggest Wang Game" ? I'd buy that gold plated version on the sidemen store every single day !  Let's make it happen !
1:1147 imagine they left with theat selfie...w ouldve been so sad
Imagine tuning in for your first time here and skipping to 1:14:40 immediately 😂
Why does vik never be in good team
Harry's sniffin' socks now. Nice one
Vikk really showed JJ with that fake house
1:16:19 look at harry on the right 😭😭
Casper is my favorite repeat personality 😂
justice for vik
Firee
I think vik should host a sidemen holiday's . For experience a good vacation at last .😅
When India and Guernsey are combined no one is safe 8:11
10/10
yall the production quality on this is insane
elite
1:18:20 these are grown ah men doing this😂😂
Whoever made the intro has some serious talent ❤ felt like i was watching a tv show
One of these videos the bad team will hijack the video and just book themselves into a 5 star hotel or resort 🤣
w outro
LOL THIS PRODUCTION IS AMAZING WTF
only sidmen have the ability to hold audience for 3hrs straight 😂😂 like today all have scrolling problem, doesn't have patience to watch something for 10-15secs 😂
1:06:11 its good how josh joined the team
you boys are stacking straight up aye? 😂😂
Vik is the new Bez for cheap team
Is there a video where JJ is not crying about anything?
14:16 ethans nigerian genes overtaking
The bad team legit be my holiday 🫠
Sidemen just launched a freaking movie mate 😂
Fitneek is turning back into Fatneek
2:16:44 LOOOOL i choked on my popcorn
Josh cooked! 🔥
last part of sleepover with boys as funny as fuck . Vik said that ,Are you boys stacking up !?😂 . It , made me laugh wholeheartedly. Good video . Actually every video of the sidemen holiday's bad team gets a lot of fun . 🎉😀
JJ ruins
35:18 why did ksi pose like a teen girl 😭😭like the leg in the air …cutie omg 😭😭
I needed 2 days to watch the entire video
harry and ethan dance....dayum
free Palestine, boycott ,
1:01:39 new sidemen channel. SIDE XL
Jj cries in the good team and cries just as much in the bad team, hahagag. What video does jj wanna make 3 hours of sitting down and sleeping. 😂
Are they making videos or movies?
This did not feel like a 3 hour video
The cheap team is a dream holiday for 99% of the world😂
Best in a while
I enjoyed the last bit more then the whole video
omg HARRY SMELLS THE WOMAN SOCK ,,,,  1:16:19
Lets appreciate the true genius behind the editing team of Sidemen
10:40 not sure what happened to ethan in morning when he woke up but he was in great spirit during this trip.  when they asked everyone to get out of bus he was like welp, the lady said get out then get out what am i going to question there about 😂
The production on this goes absolutely crazy
The amount of crybabies and glazers in the comments are always so funny, it's not that deep lads, at the end of the day, it's just a couple of mates having fun in a video, overdoing their reactions and sometimes acting for our entertainment.
How does 7 blokes on a screen make me laugh so much, need more among us though
i feel bad, i really wanted harry and vikk to get the good team, maximum times its ksi on the good team
One of the best Sidemen Sundays yet.
vik asking what has done he has missed nearly every more sidemen video since his wedding
Nah 3 hour sidemen Sundays hit different
1:51:46 😂 love it.  You can talk to me anytime 😀 hope you got the turns going. Give me a shout if you need any more lessons.
Steve in the ski gear goes off
Vik is being treated like an outsider. It's always him who is treated like this and it's always Josh who treats him like this. I don't think they like vik . Glad that vik has great friendship with other great youtubers and DJs bcoz none of the sidemen like him clearly and especially that boring f#ck josh
crazy intro
Absolute banger
47:34 simon being genuinely annoyed and outbursted "These videos are famous cause zerkaa is not in it "🤣🤣
3 hours ain’t it
17:56 😂
3 hours... Why not split it up in 3 separate video's that are one hour? The viewers would be fine with that
I bet JJ, being lactose intolerant, had an interesting night after eating all that cheese.
Seeing Callux ruined the whole video
Not sure what it is but just seeing calfreezy pisses me off
Bro JJ is so rude bro😭🤣.The poor guy was just asking for a pic. NPC💀🤣
3hrs I am in for a treat now
Josh is GOATED. Love these vids man.
JJ on that slideing thing, face cam and screaming was soooo fun.
i actually got the chills from the 2 peak walk montage holyyyy
W video
Who let’s vik speak he waffles do much
who  is the skiing instructor
This one was mid
Jj consistently being on good team is lowkey getting annoying lol
I don't think JJ should ever be on the good team. Too rich. Should have to constantly live in the trenches
best sidemen sunday till date without a question
one of the best yet.
why does ksi look like the default dark skin fortnite character at (1:14:48)
the best sidemen sunday for a long time. Congrats boys!
Tobi dressed as naruto
1:16:52 poor vik haha
One of my favourite sidemen videos
Damn 3 hours 😮‍💨
3 HOURS??
bad team got the SS instructor 😆
Casper and JJ funny ass duo 😂😂
KSI referring to brokeys as NPC’s is hilarious
3 hours and not a moment skiped what a banger honestly love it wish to see more bangers. And big ups to Vik 😂 man needs a good team just once
59:20 GYAAAAAT
No one vote for vick. Seriously 😮😮boo !!@!!!!
Intel says KSI is bulking to fight Conor McGregor
Randy doing the standup was awesome!
20:08 i wonder how vik got a jacket
3hour long ! But not the best vid this year.
29:47 Harry nearly exposed his secret batman identity 😂
1:16:20 why tf does Harry smell the sock😭😭😭
3 Hour sidemen video.... This dinner bouta be crazy long
The cheese at 46:52, what is that call? I need to try that, it looks so good :P
3 HOUR SIDEMEN SUNDAY, OH MY GOODNESS.
By far the best vs holiday and a 3 hour joy couldn’t be any better tbh
Zerkaa cooked for this video !
Vik planning murder while harry is done with life 😂
3hours? Wow Sounds like biggest W
The production was soooo nice
1:16:18 naah thats wild bro took a sniff😭😭😭😭
I thought Harry was the autistic one not JJ and Ethan
KSI LOOKS SO THICK
all the nigerians on one team ..... nice
3 hrs. God damn.
Bros 30 behaving like a 15 years old
2:16:40 this clip man 😂
SEND HER SOCK my way
JJ character is starting to become cringe and annoying he should behave mature sometimes
1:33:04 is a cold Simon moment and I’m here for it
Best
The ending was really good, felt like a high budget production when it was just the boys in a cheap vs expensive video😂
Great video if this is the new style love it great ending
bruh LOL. my phone picked up harry saying "i cant be asked" as he was saying it over and over and i look down and i see it looked up meaning and it pulled up "i cant be bothered" which i saw the EXACT same time harry said it. like i read it the speed he said it word for word. wild
That outro was a very pleasant and fitting vibe
The mountain peak bridge drone shots are absolutely gorgeous. Is that not very clearly copyrighted music though? I hope this video doesn't get claimed it deserves all the ad rev
The SOCK OVER THE BOOT
Josh does it again
"Why does Harry sniff those women's socks?"   1:16:19  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Did somebody notice jj reflex 40:24
After seeing all the 3hrs of the video… feels lonely now
1:35:10 😂😂 justice!!
1:40:38
FATNEEK IS BACK!!!
3 hours😭😭
Actually really enjoyed watching this keep up the hard work lads
Bro it's always funny when they do KSI dirty with that go pro angle of his head but that edit after he said "I feel so fat" had me dying bro 😂😂😂😂
Yoooo this editing is fireeeee  🔥🔥🔥🔥
why does ethan have a scar?
Somehow, your longest videos tend to hold my retention more than your 30 minute ones… you guys are unmatched
Thank you for visiting my beautiful country 🇨🇭
Nah I feel so bad for vik cause he’s such a big skier and he got no votes 😭
3 hours video! Is this a bollywood movie? 🤣
Why was ksi not in the intro i almost taught he was no in the video he is my favorite in the sidemen 😊
41:27 TRUE FAN!
3 hrs of Cinematic Content 🔥
Everything about this is mental!!!!! Could definitely get used to a sdmn movie every Sunday
Fatneek in the hot tub looks white.....
Another banger🤩
The sidemen having a winter holiday. Meanwhile me getting ready for Iranian new year. Bad times around here😂
It’s 2030 and this video is still a banger.❤❤
I love Josh
no at this point vik and h are asking not to bein a video again man they r ruining the joy of it
1:18:27 Outrageous
dayum vikk is really a positive guy, he tried to even enjoy cheap team instead of crying over it.
Harry taking a sniff of the sock as camera pans away got me dead ☠1:16:19
Josh definitely sets up the best sidemen Sunday videos he puts so much effort 👍🏻💯
The addition of the songs really upscales it. Sick video!
ksi has the uwu form
33:19 ksi giving a science masterclass
Jj always gets the good team 😭
omg Harrys face @2:16:40 that was hilarious. Reminds me of the dude who loves trains
Ethan and Tobi being NPCs was sending me 🤣😭😭
Great ending ❤
looks like we are getting the fatneek back again😂😂
2:30:20   Had me in tears. KSI screaming and incapable of functioning whilst Vik ski’s past ⛷️
The intro was sick
I knew this vid was gonna be a banger just by looking at the intro
this was one of the best sidemen sundays
"they not sidemen, they sideboys" JJ keeps on crying😹😭
Bro simon snaped at 1:10:26😭
"No, I'm still shooting" 😂
After the voting Simon is out the Video 😂
love that they played "Jerk it Out" 2:04:21 reminds me of SSX3 on PS2. Ahhh good old days
Ethan and JJ were such an aholes at the bus. Especially to the fan who wanted a picture.
It was sweet of simon to give the bed to Vik 🎉❤
I think it'd be jokes if the sidemen randomly got assigned a member of the troops (Randy, Callux, CalFreezy, Deji and so on) and they plan some random holiday for them to go on. Good or bad lol
The production on these videos can’t be overstated 🔥
Great video. Only complaint I have for the holiday videos now is that the bad team just doesn’t get bad places to stay anymore. The older holiday vids the bad team got genuinely bad places to stay
Love the 3 hour video!
fair play to them came a long way
1:16:19 WHY DID HARRY SMELL THE SOCK 🤣🤣🤣🤣
“Is that atom?” - KSI 2024 33:31
IMPORTANT!: KSI MARCH 2024 STATUS: KSI fat bod regained 1:07:44 -8203 power +2754 defence +12 happiness -7923 abs Updated score: 1,640 / 15,000 Overall Updated Life Rating: B-
Hated seeing JJ on the good team  after being so rude to the people on the bus...
Ksi always land in nice team no fun 😒 😑 😕
U must really love sidemen to watch a 3hr vid
1:17:59 my 2 brain cells at night
Dude, vik needs a good team in the next video. #StopVIKabuse
It's sad how Josh is forcing Harry to drink
I never see tobi in the bad team why is that ? Also jj is sooo funny man I can’t stop laughing 😂
Harry in the snorring dungeon was elite 🤣 HArd!
I prefer to watch when JJ is on the bad team 😂
Lmao that sleepover part was hilarious
WHAT A BANGER VIDEO. Guys like the damm video Josh cooked with this one ❤❤❤
Classic sidemen sunday🎉
I want one of these videos where all sidemen are on the same team. Having them all together is more fun ngl
Sorry but i feel bad for vik .
honestly 3 hours in nice for me more content to watch
Honestly really enjoyed the whole vid....my smile never went ...fun through and through
I don’t like Casper it’s too much
An all time classic, what a video. ❤❤ big up the Sidemen
3 hrs
Sick video defo should make more of these!!
casper the goat
3hr sidemen video omg am I in heaven 😭😭
1:16:18 nah, why's he smelling it 😭
ksi the worst person to have on the snow being on the good side and vik on the bad is so criminal 😂😂😂
For me this video tops it big up everyone this was so entertaning
atp i think zerkaa is putting vik on the bad team on purpose can he do the selection on camera next time
3 hours … surely that’s the longest but I’m here for it 😂💯
“Vik was so sick he had to bail on a video only a few days prior to this” was all that was running through my head at the beginning 😂 what a trooper he is 💜 Edit: omg he’s still sick 2:26:20 😭😭
Sad that Ethan is FAT AGAIN…😢 stop slacking
This was fuckin sick bro!!! Love this so much
Cheap vs expensive vs Josh would bang
ay if any one of the sidemen especially josh is seeing this, i’ve been watching the sidemen for about 8 years or so now and this video was genuinely in the top category, this video was absolutely perfect and thank you josh for this video and especially the camera crew for catching the priceless moments of the boys just being boys not knowing the camera was rolling especially at the sleepover when they were going to bed, hope to see more videos like this ABSOLUTE PERFECTION especially with the 3 hours THANK YOU
All the boys are living many people's dream life
Harry caught lacking 1:16:17 is crazy lmao
production keeps going up every week
Absolute CINEMA
1:50:07 come on j 😂😂
Jj should be left out of vids he thinks hes bigger than them and ruins it
Phenomenal!!!! FREAKING!!!! VIDEO!!!!!
Love the long video!
i luv you josh, legit best vids from you
whenever i watch these video i fell ksi as ungrateful lol
Ending is perfect
Only Sidemen can pull off a 3 hour upload. Love ittt, watching this over multiple dayss
25:38 i have never seen anyone count to 3 w their hands like that 😂
Vick 🥱🥱
WHY AM I GETTING SO MUCH LIKES? 😂😂😂
Ethan’s laugh sounds like Elmo 😂
Your all lies your cereal isn't the best it taste like cardboard
How far they have come is honestly insane. The production quality now is top tier. Keep growing and enjoying life boys.
Their cheap team is someone's luxury.
1:08:50 This unlocked a core memory hearing that intro again
3 HOURSSSS!!? I LOVE THIS SO MUCH OMG
FATNEEK is back!
this is longer than the sidemen documentary. lesssgoooo
nah why are they so mean to vik, its actually horrible to watch - look at his face when josh announces no one voted to him, actual pain
Ahh nothing like multi millionaires treating people "below them" terribly for their own enjoyment
The ending was absolute jokes 😭😭😭😭🤣🤣
9:20 look at the phones he got😭
Wham head 😂😂😂
One of THE BEST sideman SUNDAYS EVERRRR!!!!!😂🎉🎉🎉🎉FULL OF TWIST AND TURNS LITERALLY❤️LOVE IT
If Vik doesn’t get on the good team next time a video like this is made we riot!
ksi looks like going fatneek again
nah these vids r gettibg too long wtf
My son was born on a SIDEMEN SUNDAY 🙏🏾🍀
And this is exactly why Josh is the best at holiday videos
poor vik XD
Not gonna lie, I'd love to keep getting these long videos, I enjoy the dynamics more than the content they're tasked with
Josh the legend 🙌🏼
only half way through and i think it’s gonna be my favorite video this year
The editing in this video was sick it felt like a movie especially those credits 👌🏽 top tier
props to josh for planning all of this.
1:05:45 find out in the next scene on sidemen Z
58:53  🐔 Josh appears in window
Safe to say Fatneek’s back 1:07:45
Keep note ones a married man 2:21:37 💀
They just seem ungrateful tbh 😂
1:00:00 that camera angle 😂
Credits were dope
this gopro on jj forehead should be permanent angel in all videos
The sleepover dialogue at the end was too good
Seems JJ just learned the term 'micro aggression'
3 hourss god damnnn letss goooo 🎉
What a great day I have today is my birthday and I get watch new sideman Sunday video ❤❤🎉
15:07 this edit.. chef’s kiss. fire
40:27 KSI Ultra Instinct?
So did Steve hit the slopes?
this but they're all on a good team or all on a bad team would be so funny
this was movie quality, top tier sidemen content
Simon and JJ giving Vik the bed was so sweet ✨
I really wanna see a expensive vs cheap vs Josh now
Love this long video
Best Sunday Sidemen vid yet!! Upload being 3hrs is one side.. but something about the edit and length of the boy's experience felt different.. in a good way. FYI Simon spits great ideas in his Beta Squad reaction videos. He's the man fr. Also I mean it when I say that I take back alot of what I said about Freezy.
I think tobi next time should be default bad team and vikk in good team
vikk doing his intro was the funniest part of the whole 3h
Casper and JJ the best duo 🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥😂😂
I love how much effort they put shows how far they’ve come 🗣️🏆
when all is said and done, the "bad" team in these videos always seem to have more fun
As usual “the boring one” puts together a banger
I love how the groups add another element to the journey’s to their destinations😂 Josh doesn’t even need to add plot twists, their overthinking and anxiety adds so much tension
This was Phenomenal!!!!!
We got a 3 hour sidemen video before GTA 6 is crazyyy...
ethans shuffling XD i cant even
37:31 thought this was an add at first
There’s gotta be an episode where both teams get both good and or bad trips
This felt a lot more homely than most Holidays, absolutely in love w/this type of personal clips, especially the last 5-10 minutes. Banger after banger this year
1:53:26
We need a sidemen try ghost hunting
Its time to sign the petition to never let ksi into the good team
Am I the only one who can't help to find Ethan and JJ's behavior towards the people in the bus, rude and unfunny
29:44
Honestly the editing on this video was phenomenal
"I'm too rich for this"  😂😂😂😂😂
8:55 this is the best thing ive seen in 2024 so far 😂
1:29:43
Another 50M views loading ❤ Banger video guys
So nice seeing 3 rappers sitting and fine dining together Toby KSI and Eminem :)
8:15 js some random black guy
Zerkaa is the GOAT
15:08 This ad was peak bro
45 mins / 3h in and its already a banger
One of if not the most greatest sidemen sunday's of all time. If this is the direction for the channel, then it is headed in the right direction. Big lads.
If somebody steals my cheese I’ll never forgive them
“Just sell the cheese”😭😭
They casually dropped a sidemen movie😂😂
Bad team was so jokes once Randy Lux and Freezy showed up so wholesome lmao
36:28 It looks like those three are targeted by snipers 😄
is this like a wanna be mrbeast?
Worst attitude award goes to KSI lmao
This felt like a 30 min vid
Felt like I was at Optus stadium with the intro music
JJ is so annoying fr
2:21:43 don't do this guys
Yall vik needs new friends
fatneek is back !
Fatneek's back!!
3 hours is amazing thanks
2:19:04 2:19:06
harry @2:16:40 with the camera angle made me cry
1:16:23 so we are just gona let harry sniff a strangers sock and let it slide💀
This genuinely felt like a movie way to go boys
Why are random strangers rude to Vik man! He is such a sweetheart!❤
All we need is a summer holiday now ❤
8:39
Micro aggression 😅😅
if jj would actually try for a change he could probably do it
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxE31rRAHrCEpQHIbV_tLK2Zn5huDpljG4?si=7nHwjLH3fK_Hfulx          Well well well
A great plot twist would be to change one person from each team like Josh did but then switch the whole team to good/bad but telling them later in the day when it’s time to sleep
23:55 the song is crazy for the team btw
take that nps 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Harry is only annoying
OMG! this is a 3 hours video!
2:54:16 that was violation 😂😂😂 then callux explaining the joke to vik was so hilarious
nah ethan has been on good team for a lot of time he shouldn't be there vik should be in his place instead.
3 hours brew, toooooooooo much
NAhh ksi actually becoming the Sir Theodore III
Good team vs josh and toby
Nah, Josh really was violated by Vik's vid at the start of the year to produce this banger😂
Can I just point out that Harry smelled that sock at 1:16:20 and the team didn’t notice. Lmfao
The production and editing is crazy
15:09 this transition is so sick man
this was amazing! well done
The production quality here was unreal. Felt like a whole movie
I'm concerned at the fact everyone in the comments has glossed over the fact that Harry  mentioned the last time he drank his eyes were yellow afterward. That's some serious liver issues with jaundice.
As someone better at skiing than 80% of the world their ability pains me
This might be one of the best sidemen videos ever
Broooo 2:16:45. The way he is running like fall guys😂😂😂😂
The "woooo girl" scene was something straight out of letterkenny 😂😂😂
Good video , funny moments, but for a 3 hour video I expected more content than just skiing and enjoy the good place they stay at.
1:56:28 "come to me vajayjay" went so unnoticed but was gold LOL
4:43 on a school trip was hialrious
Please do more long form content! This banged!
For me personally this has to be my favourite video since the original Holiday Vids. Thanks for all the content over the years. ❤
From now on if Josh hosts the video his forfeit should be joining the bad team
This one was the best vs video ever!!! I LOVE THIS ONE !!!! OML!!!
Yo in the sidemen video if vik is not in the good team the I am going unsubscribe
BANGER
19:33  that devilish smike 😂😂😂
na brooo 18:12 this is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Whoever edits these videos need a raise 💯
Yo in the sidemen video if vik is not in the good team the I am going unsubscribe
The 3 Nigerians are back in a team😂
Finally an actual top tier video
Appreciation for vikk 🎉
This video slapped so hard. I was laughing constantly! Big ups
THESE VIDEOS ARE CRAZYYYYYYY!!!!! KEEEP MAKING THEM SIDEMENNNNNN I LOVE YALLLLLLL ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This video is great i started watching it at 2 30 am and its 5 30 i got work at 8am but i dont regret it 😂 loved every part, the ending made me laugh a lot though
best sidemen sunday ever, you CANNOT change my mind
the production on this one is like a movie damn, kudos to the editors
1:01:39 Can’t believe they put in an unedited JJ
Ngl the cheap team looked like they had way more fun 😂😂😂😂
I loved watching those video but ksi is way to much
I FEEL BAD FOR VIK AND JJ, THIS TIME I WANT TO SEE JOSH ON A BAD TEAM
How soon will there be.£ 10000 vs£ 100 honeymoon ??. Some brave couple might try ???
The Title should be "Sidemen Cheap Vs Expensive Winter Holiday Movie" 😂😂
3 hours?! Mad ting
if this video does not get 30m plus it's criminal
i did not expect to hear jerk it out, took me back in timeee
Yo in the sidemen video if vik is not in the good team the I am going unsubscribe
$200? that was atleast 2k for the average people its fairly nice I think honestly and after their crew packaged brand new clothes for them they complain too much even if its not top of the line
3 hours??!! God damn
3 hours of sidemen video is what we didn't wished for but we got it😭😭
Does no one like Vik in the sidemen? Because he’s my favorite
Harry sniffing the girls sock and no one mentioning it is hilarious to me
Who ever was filming the losing team got some great angles btw
is it just me or the begining felt like a deja vu, i had to check wether i've wtched this episode before or not.
The black screen at the end😂🤣
I like how most of the bad team stuff throughout the series are the normal things they'd do 10-8 years ago. Now they bathe in money😩
Josh Cooked
is no one gonna say something when harry sniffed the woman's sock in 1:16:19?
compare to ksi team  with ethan and tobi , vik simon and harry had good chemistry.
Its so freaking good.... 3 hours felt short lol
The audio at the sleep over was amazing. Reminds me of my old sleepovers
nah pls put JJ more on bad team. mans need to be humble
3 hours is wild but I absolutely love it. Bout to have the biggest feast while watching this
The chef's reaction was soo wholesome fr...
Cheap vs expensive Australia east coast road trip when?
Harry on another list for sniffing that sock
HARRY SMELLS THE SOCK HAHAHAHHAA
If Tobi won even after adding 20 secs to JJ . Ksi did it well and bare in mind Tobi is small height and body soonits easier to do bodyweight exercises
Idk why but sidemen videos feel bettter than mr beast videos cause they entertain us but mr beast just makes cool content that amuses us but that aint enough sidemen videos have that funny part in em
Cashper is just certified best instructor, let's get that clear right now. 💯
KSI is on the good team way too much
Petition for vik to be on a good team the next video😅
so proud of VIK..honestly this man is really gr8..he hasn't been on the good team for eons now...and still deals with every situation with smile and good attitude...but next time if vik is not on the good team..i'm skipping it
ending was elite 😂😂
Congrats! 🎉🎉
The next bad team should be accompanied on holiday by Phil.
01:16:18 No way Harry sniffed the sock lol!!!
can't wait for Freya to react on a 3hour long video
2:16:40 I laughed out loud 🤣🤣🤣
Honestly it’s mad how much like a movie has this felt, and I hope these keep going alongside what old content felt like. Nothing but props 👏🏻👏🏻
last 5 min the funniest 🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆
that was a wholesome ending
Song at 19:35?
intro was so cold... pun intended
Damn, JJ is big!
Show love for Josh, you guys
3 hrs sidemen video let me go and buy the supermarket itself to watch the video whilst eating
harry sniffing the sock had me dead
This is much better than watching a movie!
Actually cooked tbh
mate it's hard to sit through JJ being so loud and rude to those dudes on the coach
3 hoursssssss🎉🎉🎉🎉
That was game sharing that was levels soundtrack insane visuals toptier big up
1:14:43 this man is a father lmao Behz never change
Did anyone else catch Harry cop a sniff of that woman's sock?
This video hits a new level guys. Production and editing are very good, copyright music to the roof. The only negative thing is that its 3 hours long so if the new videos going to be as long as this i have to skip it to the next day. But that’s my problem. Insanely good video can’t wait to get more videos like this.
Best gift of the month
Production really stepped up in this one especially towards the end. Felt like an actual travel/adventure show. Credit to Josh
Harry saying, “ohhhh f me” was amazing
Naaah 24k magic! Sidemen spending P’s on music?
Sidemen on bad holidays: Jj- Meltdowns aka content Vik- enjoys it anyways Harry- a giant cry baby Simon- silent depressed  Tobi- grateful Ethan- grumpy Josh- well?
What is Toby wearing
How do they manage to make a 3 hour vid entertaining the whole way through?
bro this is a literal movie
Poor vik man😂😂
HAHA BUDDIES HAIR LOOKS HILAROUS WITH A RED BEARD
3HOURS?!
even dune wasnt this long
Damn JJ has really let himself go
They did JJ dirty with the GoPro angle 😂
just realized its a fkin 3 hour long video, more like a fukin movie
So JJ rlly goin back to fatneek again
Surprised they got such good music for this.
great video we need another one keep up the work
I’ve been watching Sidemen Sundays for almost since they started popping and have always thought they should bring two fans for these holidays. One on the good team and one on the on the bad team. Would be a really cool and fun twist!
24:49 now i feel like ik what it’s like to not understand English because WHAT DID HARRY EVEN SAY?
The “cheap” team is more just an average family holiday to the snow. Like I have never been to the snow and as weird as it is to see snow is a dream of mine and I would do anything to to have the trip the the “cheap” team had
2:16:40
So weird seeing Verbier. I’m from there 😂 damn I missed the sidemen
KSI looking thicc
3 hours that’s 3 days worth of dinner 😂 ❤
I love all the sidemen and respect them but it's just sad to see Vikk being an after thought, like bro doesn't have a person thinking about him in the group, he's always an afterthought, JJ doesn't like Vikk's company from many videos we've seen, Harry doesn't either but he doesn't show it directly but still shows discreetly, Ethan and Josh couldn't care less, Simon is someone who atleast respects the man and is quite happy to at least be with him, and Tobi is the only one who is the most friendly to Vikk and appreciates him. It's just sad, but props to vikk in all honesty bro's always an afterthought and he looks sad inside but is so sweet and is so positive. I know I don't know them personally but from what I've seen throughout the years I've been a fan of them, it's just sad to see Vikk being treated so differently, at this point I think he might be the first one leaving the Sidemen as he has friends who actually appreciate him like Lazar beam and Lachlan. Like even in Vikk's wedding the best man wasn't even a sidemen member who he's been friends with ages for but Lazar beam was it just shows. (Everyone can say that Vikk distanced himself from the sidemen, but bro from what we've seen through the years I don't think there was any road to start with for Vikk to distance himself from, it was legit a pair group, Simon & JJ, Ethan & Harry, Josh & Tobi, like bro had no space to to begin with.)
They should do ghost hunting
Nick didn't believe the compliments after the potato diss lmao
The ending is so cute 🩷
vik needs to get angry  everytime how is he on the bad team i am feeling sad for him he is a nice person
Whoever made the Ksi to house transitions, needs a raise.
My man Harry running like a Titan it's confirmed he is Eldian blood 🤔🤔
KARMA FOR THE KSI!
Honestly Vik did bits he was so funny
Fat Neek is resurfacing. Soon....
that camera angle at 1:00:00 did JJ dirty ahahaha
The beeroll of the shales is crazy
Loved this so much rollercoaster of fun many ups loads of downs but everything just right deffo want another sidemen Sunday like this a movie after work best ending to a night ❤😂
35:06 "Nah I weigh too much" -KSI Bulk season is here bois!
Give vik a good team next time please
ayoooooooo KSI is down bad lmao
2:11:25 Vik is a lovely guy
The expensive team is hell of BORING
no because the way harry ran across that bridge stole my air and left me wheezing.
Love love Coldplay
What hoodie is harry wearing
8:46 best bit hahaha
Production was quality, love the movie vids! I think the bad team should be more exciting. I feel like the reason they don’t like the bad team is because they were bored and they got bossed around, give them an actively that is like actually uncomfortable or embarrassing but in a place that is exciting. Just a thought 💭 let them create the story and outcome, those are the best vids!
Harry stop bro
18:10 the cinematics🥵🥵🔥🔥
I don’t think that’s a cigar JJ 😂😂😂😂 1:59:54
I just watched a sidemen movie and I loved every second of it.
Zerkaa s done madness. the production the video is mad
KSI got some A cups
SHARED! …………… BUNK!! 😂😂
WHERE IS THE GUY WITH THE TIMESTAMPS?!!
Josh cooked. Felt like I was watching a movie at times!
Three hours later. That was incredible
3 hours this is getting out of hand
the audio at the end has got to be my fav part 😭 reminds me of sleepovers back in the day where u stay up laughing for hours
1:08:03
Adelaide United intro goes hard❤
Hope Vik leaves the Sidemen for his Ozzy friends, yet again just shows that nobody on the Sidemen rates him. Such a good and funny guy doesn’t deserve it.   Once he leaves, they might appreciate him more than just making him like the black sheep every video.
Boys what an absolute banger, this was the best movie/youtube video I've seen
This is awesome I can only hope to have some guys like u guys have each other some day 👍 loved the vid
2:32:19 would go hard as an album cover
im convinced josh wud rather be on the bad team tbh he just chills wit them
I want to see all the sidemen boys take a $200 trip together
It would be funny asf if sometime someone on the bad team just said nah fck it. And just spent their own money to get better stuff😂
Deadass some of the most enjoyable moments are just when the boys are chillin and vibing w everyone
FULL ON MOVIE!!
Common W from Harry for hating Denmark
Where can i get those All In One suits? they look sick!
Nah bro justice for vik star
Fantastic video!
3 hrs?
This is exactly what I needed. I watched the full 3 hours and felt like I could’ve kept watching. This was amazing
bro made a movie
multiple night makes it so much better, feels like an actual trip
who else watch this in one sitting
damn 3 hours
Watching ksi enjoy life not having to worry about boxing absorbing his life is so refreshing
3 hour video? 🎉
Nah Ksi turning to fatneek again😢
Well done editors. Great video, great edit
fatneek is back!!
also jj im a kinesiologist i wanna see slower more controlled bench press from u
the "Jerk It Out" ski/snowboard montage was so good, amazing vibes
Man I did feel bad for Vik. But this is one of the ones I kind of liked the cheap team. My favorite tho was the last 10 minutes with the guys having a sleepover lol. Vibes were great.   For the good team. My favorite part was that sky bridge. Watching gave me anxiety but I’d be terrified but I think it would be a cool experience.
Every sideman Sunday should be this long😂😊
knowing that JJ is too rich to read the comments, I think the rest of the Sidemen should keep putting JJ on the bad team, and Vik on the good team, until JJ doesn’t say “I’m too rich for this” in a video😂
1:03:30 fiiiiiiittttt
the man at 1:06:56 must be an alien  who doesnt know how to play rock paper scissors?????
vik was freezing 😭
The return of FATNEEK!
i love vik man, always staying positive and keeping things going. big up big man vik
ngl Tobi add nothing to these videos.
This is sooooooo good!!!!!!!
I watched 1 hour and then looked at time and realised it is 3 hour long 😂
3hr video, worth every minute.
3 hours is crazy work
3 hour video brudda that's a movie
I love it when Zerkaa plan these getaways 😁❤️🇵🇭
1:00:44 theres no reason why this view is that funny
Vik outfit was fire other 2 was crazy but vik looked decent
1:01:39 caught me off guard 😂😂
the bad team seems like what i’d love to do with a group of friends challenges and everything and drinking
It's like movie 🎥🍿 now  3 hrs holy 🐄😅😂
Vik mad annoying
Iv just seen it’s a 3 hour video and 💩 my pants let’s goooo
cashpur is pure gold
Loved the ending this was amazing
3 hours dam
59:08 i rate josh for doing this
Ngl the randy stand-up was golden😭
jjs been a little zesty recently..
top two sidemen sunday and it isn’t number two. cheers to a great group of friends creating memories that’ll last forever 💙
Which video did Simon paint Kasper?
Man Tobi gets good team and still using is phone and not talking to others. Put him in bad team for this year and Vik in good team.
1:16:20 Harry smelling the sock😭💀
Can we start a petition to get vikstar out of the sidemen orrrrr just the videos
Imo I feel like it’s so obvious how vik is always chosen last or not chosen at all and I think he deserves better. Simon has been the sweetest to him. I don’t like seeing it tbh ~
Gonna be a long dinner
Ethan and the fourth wall is hilarious XD
Nah bro 3 hours your jus taking the piss
Kinda sad the outcome, watching JJ have to put up with peasantry is mad entertaining
at 2:53:00 and onwards I couldn't stop laughing lol honestly fave moment of this ep. This ep was a banger thru and thru with all the twist and turns. In the end it seems all the bois enjoyed themselves so all happy days. banger episode and banger vibes
1:03:20 tobi was so quick on them bars wtf and bigg up the edit team 🔥
Videos get more series like
2:16:41 finished me
Honestly Vik, Harry and Simon fits at the start are sick
So Tobi always getting the good team but never has to make any content??? Cool
Beautiful, let’s start a new trend Sidemen!  Minimum 2hr each Sunday! Joshy man! Your beautiful brilliant big head at it again! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
tobi was getting busy bro couldn't even film at the end
Ethan in the middle with tobi and jj
The end was so funny 😂😂😂
Day 23 of trying to get sidemen to pin me
53:30 anyone else think8ng of the clip where jj is hiding in the middl3 of the  pool
Get them to 500,000 likes boys
Damn that intro📈
i was at an hour and twenty minutes in when i first realized it was 3 hours long. nobody does it like the sidemen. 3 hours of entertainment??? legacy.
sick intro!
Could be interesting to do one where the cheap team has a fun trip planned while the expensive team budget is all on them doing “bad” stuff. Really drive home that  cheap ≠ bad and vice versa
UHHHHHHH 14:02
When they skipped and sang to a bar I died 😂
Jj calling the people on the bus npcs was fkn hilarious
Was harry getting pressed at the Denmark comment?
Yah! 😂😂
I guess fatneek is back
My man 3 hour.....yessssssssssssssssseseeeee
i paused the video before ive found out which team is cheap or not but, I js watched the documentary about the sidemen and im pretty sure they gave ethan pity and chose to put him on the good team idk
3 hour video absolutely fenominal ❤
sidemen stand up comedy would be so good
made a 3 hour video not feel long enough.
🔥
49:24 rollercoaster fr
Wonder where Kon is feel like haven’t seen him film a sidemen Sunday in ages
1:46:04 really !
Cashpur is too jokes ja 😂
cashper was such a good feature
3hour Sidemen Sunday living for it
Absolute banger of a video!!
i skipped a lot of early jj
Idk how but i guessed exactly what Ethan was going to say at 1:21:54
Simon : “here is my friend, his name is uhh olijede”😂
Tobi rigged the wheel
3 Nigerians  🇳🇬 together
They got credits now 🔥🔥
Time for me to stayup overnight to watch this
Cant express how much i look forward to sundays because of the bois!!!....[pause]
Nah sidemen y’all keep putting vik in the bad teams YALL better put him in a good team or I’m unsubscribing 😂😂😂
2:16:39 Harry looks like the character from that animated ice age movie, I haven't seen the movie, and I don't know it's name  but not the mammoth, and not the squirrel, and not the saber tooth tiger
This is the best type of sidemen sunday by far. The travel videos that are cheap vs expensive and are atleast 1 and half hours is so awesome to watch!
Simon been hugging his bois much as of late, he pregnant or thinking bout it fr fr gn gbye
and Vik lol
que buen video la puta madre
The editing in this video man its crazy and I love it
Might be the best sdmn Sunday ever ngl
27:45 ksi yelling for tobi to help  meanwhile tobi : 27:49 😂
Seeing them all walk out the cabin at the end after the sleepover reminded me of an ending of a horror movie. They survived against the odds!
Harry deserved to switch to the good team after all the public speaking he had to go thru lmao
21:45 tobi had me dying😂
Is no one going to point out the fact that the guys met someone who didn’t know how to play rock paper scissors?😂 1:06:51
fatneek
I can't watch this . JJ complaining even while on good team. It's disappointing at least.
Vik and casper on their romantic ski lol a 3 hour video is such a treat !!!!
My new sidemen fav video
Am I the only noticing that Kon has not been any vids?
Im just glade Ethan, Tobi and Ofc KSI had fun. Harry and Simon too
2:56:13 Why was that actually funny 😂
JJ so fat
2:50:35 I’m glad they made Vikk’s day better
1:16:19 No ones gonna talk about harry sniffing the sock 😂😂 classic
8:05 is crazyy
vikk saying 'got the boost boys'  02:06:00 was ammazing
I love how Vik is so positive and is always trying to see the good in everything
Has KSI ever enjoyed anything in any of these videos?
2:29:44 The synchronised dancing was amazing!
Where did Simon go lol ?
10:46 vikk is adorable!
This video is literally PEAK Josh is an absolute legend
2:49:03 Harry’s flip was sick
10/10 editing
1:04:53 body guard checking that old bloke was funny ash to me dude walloped Simon’s fist for no damn reason
Absolute banger
2:16:40 funniest Harry moment
I have been a lifelong sidemen watcher and fan and never really comment on videos but I feel compelled to comment on this video. Absolutely one of there best and I hope they do more 2-3 hour videos. I don’t know what else to say really I have grown from 13 years old to now 19 watching them every day basically reruns and all, love all of them even though they dont know me.❤️
The adverts every 5 seconds are really not needed...makes it very difficult to get into the video
At the end, I was just thinking that this was a nice movie. Then the credits roled.🤣🤣🤣
2:46:20 I would’ve been out too we all know what happens in the movies 😂
love Kasper
smashed it out of the park
1:08:14 how’s Ethan fat again
Whoever edited this video deserves serious praise because I can’t imagine how many hours of footage they went through.
Casper 2:11:10 “This is beneath me. This is SIDEBOYZ Yeah” hilarious!!
@Zerkaa, how about a change ? Both teams are the good team for once. Would be fantastic to see both teams thinking they are the bad team.
Seriously I'm sick of babying JJ. Quit giving him the good team just because he doesn't participate until he gets his way on the bad team. Seriously without informing him make him be on the bad team with Simon and Toby then interchange other players aside JJ on the bad team until he participates or move players to the good team to have more on the good team then bad team until he learns his lesson. He has truly never been crushed on the bad team like Vic or Ethan. I want to see him truly be humbled and learn how to be positive and participate and stop being so spoiled. He is literally corrupting the other sidemen with his poor attitude along with Vic's bad luck on the bad team on big videos.
One of the best videos, I loved this one
This is the best video any of these boys have ever made. The storytelling and edit is incredible
Tobi loves Harry see 2:06:23
1:15:50 Harry smells the sock
I swear vikk is always the one to be left out,feels bad... justice for vikk❤️
nothing better than waking up to a 3 hour long sidemen video 🙏🏽
The sock on Harry’s boot was hysterical
let vik be in a good team!❤😂
Finally, a good length video! Great content!
Loved this ❤️ hope for more to come
They just acting at this point they all rich already but JJ always goes mad like crazy when he sees the good things
I’m not gonna lie I’ve seen these snowsuits online and they look sick as hell. Viks lookin fly as shiiiiii❤😊😊
1:52:58 Patrick Star
This is as close as we're gonna get to a sidemen movie
Only an hour in and such good vibes to this vid. Love the Sidemen
The best part of the whole vid is the bad team’s ski instructor. He’s so funny with Vick and jj.
there’s so much to mention in this video, the musical score & the editing is unreal, Josh did so amazing with this video also cashpur calling vik, viky & JJ, vajayjay had me CREASING 😭 also Harry’s camera angle at 2:16:40 😂😂😂 absolute banger of a video
3 HOUR LONG SIDEMEN SUNDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!
the moment before everyone goes to sleep at a sleepover is always either funny or the deep 3am talks
6:24  "We're going to Circle around Geneva" JJ: "What we sucking?? what?"😂💀
The sidemen should make an actual movie
2:16:40 The titans be like
I just realised that vik hasn't been on the good team for months or maybe years. If it were anyone else they'd wouldn't be smiling after the Shitel incident...
2:12:48 That view is spectacular!
this was a LITERAL MOVIE LOVED THIS
8:08 harry real for that
I wonder if the good team made it a three way tie to the bad team, would Josh have just swapped the whole teams over
Man jj being a sook just ruins these videos man up and have a go
1:36:46 kinda feel bad for vik
3 hours is just awesome
Well according to Google dude doesn't know how to speak German cuz this is actually the translation for heavy bollocks Grosse Bälle
1:54:15 That entrance!
THREE HOURS RAHHHHHH LETS GOOOO
1:53:50 💀
Its a long day for the bad team i swear
JJ & Ethan on good team. 💤
3 hours is avatar levels wtf…
Feels like a TV show
3 hrs is crazyyy
1:53:30 What was Cashpur doing to JJ 😂
3 hour video… Let’s goooooo…
Just finished this 3 HOUR long video! This was a banger!
JJ getting his vacation weight back
When did youtube start allowing using songs in videos?
1:53:16 JJ joined the bad team and just gave up
I don't even watch the vids at this point I just go into it and like it cause it's always a banger❤
Does JJ have his Septum Pierced ?
1:52:16 Harry just talking to the video
Vik and Cashper are a phenomenal pairing
1:51:18 “Ja Vikky this is good” Cashpur is hilarious 😂
Another BANGER 🔥
1:48:25 JJ face planting into the snow whilst Cashpur is saying Ja ja
no one picking vik tells it all once again lmaooo why is bro here
I swear that Cashpur, however its spelt, had me in stitches 😂
Why’re there copyright music aren’t they gonna lose money ?😭
Imagine having no balls using the brakes on a sled😂😂
Wheres ksi
wow jj on a good team
3hrs of pure happiness!
3 HOUR SIDEMEN VIDEO
Ethan & JJ interrupting Tobi’s massage 😂 1:18:05
3 HOURS OF SIDEMEN SUNDAY?!?!?! IM SO READYYY
Ethan: Bye Migros 👋🏻 Every Black person: 🤨
3 hours vid lfg
Karma is a dark mistress of misery my friend
My man harry deservew one good team video😅
Simon Vikk and Harry definitely didnt walk 😂😂😂 20:13
@49:16 the harry face omg lmfao
I really felt for vik getting no votes.
W music choices
Harry trading cheese for a sock, then smelling it is hilarious
Where did Simon go in the second half
Vikk getting a piggy back from that supporter was wholesome
3 hrs .. this is amazing
59:59 JJ’s Forehead cam 😂
Each sidemen should be responsible for the team they get, as in they have an influence to which team they go. Like they can do rock paper scissors, closest number etc letting them choose which team they want without telling them if it's the good or bad team. It would make the videos more entertaining like if ksi realized he could've had the good team etc and seeing them rage over their own decisions
39:50 “Oh my god eat me”
38:16  JJ 😂
This years sidemen sundays have peaked this year!
Too lengthy video😵
1:17:44 is fat neek back?
1:16:19 did harry smell that lady's socks 😂😂
32:32 Vikk just sliding on the snow
FINALLY!!!
Back to back bangers?!? 2024 Sidemen is next level
2:58:13 just hearing the laughing of the boys, without visuals, is just really funny.
The sledging looked so cool
Woke up to watch my Sidemen vid as per usual, saw holiday and 3 hour length, had to check it wasn't December 25th.
when did JJ become funny again
The end of this video was so wholesome. My Man Josh has legit created a movie for a Sidemen Sunday. Absolutely incredible... No one does it like the Sidemen!!!
23:51 Those fits are clean.
Production quality is through the roof
17:42 Ethan reading out the hotel names
3 hours! Nah, too much
Does anyone know the song they use in the background at 2:54:00, they've used it before in the nice vs bad team challenges, but that video was from years ago and I still can't find it
The chill vibes and the friendship vibes were here this video
I actually feel bad for Harry man lol
15:56 😂 - 16:07
bro ksi's security is always spitting game to gals in the backround
11:15 Tobi acting like an NPC with Ethan
JJ saying NPC to the dude who asked for a picture with him was too good
8:27 JJ’s face
we need 5 hours sidemen sunday!
My fav content is back.
Hot tub time machine vibes
2:58:10 😂😂
3 hour banger👏well done boys
❤
3 hr sidemen Sunday video lessgoo 💯👌 Great video lads
fatneek returns ?🤨
Dayumm. 3 hours. Josh really hates vik tho. Man doesn’t ever get the good team.
This is movie not a video ❤❤
1:01:40 that edit is horrendous😂
Honestly…Vik carried this video 😊
this would never happen but it would be such a great and satisfying twist on this series if Josh did a bad team consisting of 6 sidemen and the good team being just Vik.
We all know deep inside, jj is jealous cuz he's not with simon
3 hours GG❤❤
pls always put ksi in the bad team because it always makes for the funniest videos
This is the second video where they have mentioned a Keith and ksi, what am I missing?
bradah! 3 hours! hell yeah, see yall next Sunday!!!
This was a movie
Pizza!! PIZZAAAA!!!!
Best Sidemen Sunday yet! ❤️
How about next sidemen Sunday holiday all the boys go on a holiday while kon is the host and chooses the teams ??
Vic just makes me not even want to watch the video he’s always so righteous and douchey
Rip to the Editors they made a hole movie 🪦
I feel like the credits at the end should be in every video, it just makes it feel good
This legit took a group of friends who just wanna have fun and the production of course to make something that takes movies moths to make I mean this sidemen Sunday was longer than most movies
1:10:23 Vha vha vou 😂😂😂
Tobi is nice and all that …but he is soo dead bro
This is the next 100 million views video in 2026   Remember this comment
Harry losing it over the atrocious list while JJ’s trying to rub it in is hilarious 😂  49:59 51:23 52:35
This is a reminder to have a sleepover with your friends at any age!
honestly vik makes the bad team the good team every time.
I love the long videos
JJs funny on video but has to be the most annoying person IRL.
Vik has become the face of the bad team. Jj and tobi is the face of the good team. Kinda getting repetitive.
A good cheap team actually makes the video better!
this feels like the sidemen movie
One of my faves this one
Apparently, the rest of the sidemen doesn't like vikstar. Vikstar should leave sidemen. I'm feeling bad for him.
Cringe 😬 the Josh song 😂
Absolute banger!!!
Credits to the editors man
Why pressure Harry into drinking if he’s not wanting to?
KSI has been gaining weight again.
3 hours! It's a damn movie now.
Bro harry sniffing the sock after she gave it to him is crazy 😂
Yo I do not remember this Caspar dude, which vid was he in?
Cheap teams fits going harddddd 🔥
after all this years JJ is still hilarious!
$200 trip? more like $20,000 trip vs $10,000 trip
I was depressed today and wanted a sidemen vid damn this is perfect 3hr sidemen vid is crazy
1:14:50 JJ looks like that one Travis Scott fish meme
Oero cookie at 38.29
Yall need to do more fire vids like this one
Tobi had a horror crash😂
Best vid ever
unc went crazy at 38:12
We need more movies. This was great, can we do a whole video of them all on a good team , troops surprise them, other celebs. Make a 5 hour one next ❤
My new favourite style of sidemen video
Also am i the only one that wants to see the full footage of too trumps 🤣
Harry and his cheese HAHAHA
24:30 harry lol “well it could be worse fellas”….pans to Simon, “We don’t even have a key!”
This video was genuinely one of the best YouTube videos I’ve ever seen from the comedy to the cinematics It was perfect
man got copyright music now yea😮
Copywritten music?? How??
I felt so bad for vik He didn't get a single vote. I teared up a little 1:35:39
This is gonna be a long dinner
3hr HOLIDAY sidemen Sunday is the life😮‍💨
Incredible video! WE GOT CREDITS SCROLL NOW?!?!?
31:24 sounds like someone’s eating Minecraft steak 😭
Why they never put ethan and vik in the same team?
3 hoursss🎉
WOW!! a masterpiece!!! BEST CHANNEL EVER
THREE HOURS!!
nobody smiles as much as kante without a big willy
Ik Josh was tryna get harry tickets drink because it makes the video better but if his eyes went yellow because he drinks to much the last thing he needs to be doing is drinking more
Tobi doing GTA San Andreas jump 🗿💀😂
2:22:49 😭Vik giving Harry vibes
These videos just motivates me to be great and have fun with my friends, Josh cooked
Ski instructor reminds me of Phil lmao
3 hours LETS GOOOO
Why no footage of Simon skiing?
1:00:13 1:08:16 ksi abs
The music at 1:25:18 is pure nostalgia
COLDDD
If this comment gets more than 5 likes, the sidemen have to film a fishing video with me 👀
1:10:22  DO u know any french ksi : yea ..... va va von
The ending black screen screen part was gold fr😭
2:30:22 isnt that a ghana must go bag
This will probably be the video of the year I’m calling it now loved every second of it
Giving snowboard to ethan doesnt make vikk got a vote
JJ reminding a whole bus full of people how immensely rich he is, is so refreshing.  It’s been a couple weeks since I’ve heard him mention it.
3 hours ❤
3 hour sidemen video oh this is gonna be a ride
1:17:28 lmfao
absolute banger of a video
JJ is now really irritating 😢
12:29 how funny would be for him to go back on the bus again after saying all that
Can we all take a moment and apreciate the content these Guys put infront of us every week the real goats off yt
3 hour sidemen Sunday? Time to 🔥LOCK IN🔥
harry INSTANTLY smelled that sock bru😭
We want more of this 🔥🔥🔥♥️♥️
3 hours???? Im here for it
End credits kinda went hard
This was literally a movie
okay this intro was a step up from the normal. well done on the animationsl.
Bro at the beginning wasn’t an NPC
Felt like a whole movie the late night ending was amazing
How have I only just found out Randolphs name isn't even Randolph??? Wtf, Andrew Shane? Very strange.
Honestly wish theyd stop spoiling the teams in the thumbnails.just black them out
The fatboyslim tunes went hard on this
ABSOLUTE BANGER
Love all the channels, but please if harry is trying not to drink for health reasons which he stated.. please respect that!! Often times we don't understand consequences until we receive then. This channel wouldn't be the same without him
The ending was peak seeing the crew interact and especially them talking in the dark had me howling 😂
Give JJ a bad team to humble the lad a bit 😂😂
nobody literally nobody casper: yeaa
2:46:06 😂😂😂
Bro Harry smelling the sock he traded the cheese for 😭😭
3 hr video is crazyyyyy ( i watched the whole thing)
AW THE CHEF WAS SO HAPPY
3hrs long is crazyy
200k likes in 7 hours, goated video
The Casper entrance was nuts, felt like a full movie 🍿
37:51 YOOO Steve being the Rizzler lowkey lol
3 hour video is brazyyyyyyyy
Bro how they just gonna drop a whole video longer than a movie
Fatneeek is baaaackk
every week i tune in to watch 7 men complain that they have more money than me
Bad team instructor honestly helped carry the bad team with vik
Who is that cashper guy I need to see more of him
Banger video! Keep it up boys!
Justice for Harry not getting to snowboard when that’s always been one of his favourite hobbies
I love these videos mehn 😂😂😂😂
If Vik doesn’t get a good team soon and I mean an actual good, good team it’s peak
zerkaa fallen off, everytime he giving ksi tobe the best team. this should change. it's not fun anymore.
"That's a crusty, skeeded old day sock!"
Just the intro is freaking amazing! Big up the editors!
Ethan the best
THREE HOURS LETS GO
How is ksi and tobi always together haha
tobi looks like he is cuba gooding jr in snow dogs haha
OLAPUNJI OLAMUNJI really is a micro aggression 😂😂😂
Love vikstar
1:16:18 why did Harry done that.😂
Bro 3 hours
I regret being one of those people in the past asking for these to be longer. Rich people doing rich stuff gets boring after a while
That video of the good teams house is crazy
Banger video especially the end on the bad team
Josh vids are always the best ngl
1:26:12 Harry record snoring ...at night 😂😂😂
the next video should be all of them on the good team and josh on the bad team with the longest list the boys could think of
Harry dancing was the best and the most hilarious moment out of the 3 hours of sidemen content😂
16:30 that Porsche looking nice tho
Where do u get the expensive teams outfits
Ksi has put some weights
this was a really good one
ABSOLUTE BANGER
2:51:54 did they just coincidentally play wavelength at the same time lol🤔
Yeah vik is not good at skiing 💀💀💀
2024 and still giving into Harry's temper tantrums. Yayyyyy 🙄🙄🙄🙄. Turned the vid off as soon as he swapped teams. Lil baby always gets what he wants of he cries loud enough.
This is definitely my favorite video of JJ. Getting Karma lol
1:03  Simon doing the vision pro gestures 😂😂😂😂😂
Am i the only one that would prefer to be on the bad team they had a great time im all for nights out and stupid tasks
Ksi on the rich side of these videos 9 times out of 10 😂
Cashper>> Phil
45 minutes and I realize Vik and/ Simon on a bad team always makes great content. Dudes need good team for once though
Best 3hours of my life❤❤
BANGER
My cheeks hurt from Laughing 😂
What’s the stats on who’s got the bad team the most? 😅 I feel like Vik, Ethan and Harry are the most stiffed 😂😂 JJ, Tobi, Simon seem to have the best luck for the good team 😂
we making 3hrs movies noww???
Be humble people!
1:16:18 Harry letting his intrusive thoughts win once again
Y did they randomly change jj outfit to green in the thumbnail when his outfit was blue
FREE PALESTINE
josh got them the jimmy savile drip 😂😂😂
Vik kept the second bad team alive. He’s a gem 😊
What kinda of watch are Ethan and JJ wearing ?
We might See vic on the good Team before gta 6
Have to reunite the original red team one of these days
8:55 9:28 39:48 43:16 2:25:08
Olibunji olimungi
BANGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Does copyright just not exist anymore or this just one for the fans?
why is no one talking about the rock paper scissors guy that security had to step in before he rocked simon. what a bellend
1:16:17 Harry's movin madd
I love the extra long video❤
❤ love it
Kaspar is a legend need more features from him
Bruh the sky bridge in NC,USA is nicer I think
Josh bangs
What a banger, not only a contender for video of the year but of all time as well
This might be the best vid of the year so far
People moaning about Ksi all the bad team did was moan to get him on the bad team this was a terrible video haha 😂
just finished watching the full 3 hours yeahh this is defo top tier video they done
Another absolute masterclass boys!
9:21 this is the single funniest sidemen interaction since like 2021
Never knew josh and Viks full name
The sleepover jokes had me sobbing 😭💀
Cashpur saying “yah” every 5 seconds was great😭
2:12:15 JJ be the uwu mascot everywhere he go.
That was brilliant
Vikk getting recognized more 🥺🥺🤩
3hr Sidemen Video 😨 damn
Tobi could definitely do an Elmo laugh I swear
Lmfao, the cheap team is literally doing benidorm challenge but winter edition..😂😂😂
Vibes were immaculate at the end for the cheap team ngl
Vik carries the bad team every time with his amazing attitude bruh JUSTICE FOR VIKK. If he’s not on the good team next time I’m skipping it lmao
That was honestly one of the best
Gonna straight up say it, this is up there as one of the best! The storylines, the activities, production value were all so good.
Plz keep JJ out of the good team, he’s super unappreciated and doesn’t enjoy the actual good team activities. All he does is whine and complain.
Why does he make such obnoxious loud sounds in public? Grow up
Casper just on another level 😂😂
Hear me out, let me cook, this is the best sidemen Sunday for og fans.
Absolute banger
1:16:19 harry just casually smelling the sock 😂
Y’all need to stop spoiling the video in the thumbnail
The Longest Sidemen Sunday ever 😁😁
The fact that this video was 3 hours long is nothing short of perfection. Great video.
We need another long video like this agin
I’m grounded for a week because of KSI talking mad about his food and my mom thought it was something else.   :(
- We know the teams from the thumbnail. The suspense is kind of unrelatable. - JJ always gets good team because he throws a tantrum otherwise - Harry always gets bad team because he turns lemons into lemonade - Tasks on bad team are boring and meaningless - Trying to make content by getting the bad team drunk  Idk boys, 1 hour in and its looking like an L video
2:42:39 Vik shouldn't be doing that celebration when he doesn't even watch football nor who does that celebration.
Why is KSI so corny nowadays bruh, always talking about how rich he is
Ethan is looking good man fit and all that .
3 hours is mad yk😂😂😂
if i was in these videos this would be me the entire time 1:07:52
Vik clearly gets put on the bad team every time because he lives the most posh lifestyle 😂
The fat guy is L content 24/7
Cheers, started this at 11pm, got a 9am rocket propulsion lecture
Only thing I learned from this video is that Toby is the only person that can pull off so much yellow like that and he's weirdly amazing at obstacle courses lmao
They should do a cheap v expensive but it’s better to be on the cheap team AKA expensive punishments for one team and a chill day for the other one
Anybody know what’s this absolute banger of a track? 18:43
Is this the future of sidemen vids 3hr specials monthly? Not that I'd complain but this felt like a sidemen special. Maybe it's just the length and silly things like credits just made this feel so different and like a shift may be coming.
Amazing..It was an actual movie 🍿🎥I enjoyed every second of it❤️Wonderful 👏🏻
1:07:58 og fans will remember the hide seek in the old sidemen house from this lol
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
bro got called an NPC when he just wanted a picture 😂😂😂😂
yes but theirs on issue and it is spring
the reason these vids get the most views is because zerka is the master planner.
the chat in the middle of the night between the boys at the end was unreal, love moments like these in videos 🙌
This is longer than Dune 2
Vik deserves better
Ain’t no way he said he thinks Jesus probably was American 😂
❤
the iconic KSI smile on minute 35 is hilarious, boom get in character
Banger man 🔥💯
3 hour video is damn nice thanks boys got me my entertainment for the week
Honestly I know its the cheap team but can they at least stabilize the footage the shakiness is really making it hard to watch. Id rather have the wobbly smooth footage than the really sharp jagged movements. Thanks. Video was still great as well!
put jj on the bad team, then itll be a great video
I’ll never understand KSI’s fame. He is so 1 dimensional, unfunny, and annoying.  Personally though, I was happy he became a boxer so I could watch him get punched a lot.
HELLA SICK VIDEOO!!!
Josh should never host these videos again. They should do a video where Josh just gets to do the most ridiculous and tedious tasks that he gave the team all day
Best sidemen Sunday
Nah the 2:12:56 Paradise drop into the view is absolutely UNREAL... Josh has done it AGAIN!! What an insane video!! 😍😍💓💓 P.S. Can't wait to rewatc this movie with Freya🤣🤣🤣
Ethan tobi ksi in red yellow blue looks like a boy band getting ready for a music video ngl
I realized that JJ’s scream on that height was surprisingly not as worse as the time when he got to face a bug. 🤣🤣🤣
Justice for Vik I need a video where the good team is just Vik (and maybe someone of his choosing)
Casper was a fantastic add to the video.
2:16:40 gopro on a dog
Why was JJ being so disrespectful too those guys on the bus
Ngl the bad team always has better content
Fat ksi is back
I get the point of the video but ksi saying I’m getting on a bus with real people  and calling them. Npc’ and shittin their holidays is wierd
The algorithm is even recommending movies to play next after this, great work guys!!
3 hours wtf
Are we just ignoring Harry smelling her sock?
JJ calling that guy an NPC to his face is crazy
bro harry reallly smelled the sock 😭
JJ should be in the bad team always 😂
1:52:15 has killed me off. Harry is a king.
Longest sidemen video😮
1:17:36 absolutely hilarious im creasing🤣🤣🤣
I thought for a second Josh flew Phil out to be their skiing coach lol
Harry smelling the sock at 1:16:19 is wild
Vik needs to be the only one in the good team next Holiday video
Should of put Ksi in the bad team by himself on the second day.
NPC’s everywhere 😂😂
didnt think id be able to watch as i usually cant sit through the 1hr vids w my attention span but this im really glad i didnt miss a second
The production is insanse!
1:59:12 lol cashpaaaah be roleplaying yey again.
Just noticed there was no Kon in credits?
Ksi back to his fat says
it's kind of true they hede on the losing team drinking hard to cope but it's really not healthy lol
3 hours 😮😮😮😮😮
1:16:20 why did harry sniff it😭😭😭
Sidemen should do like heist card or something, when they win a sidemen game or challenge they get a card and they can choose to hijack other teams place they’re going to, they wont know if its good or bad though, so obviously they get asked before the Sidemen sunday or solo team switch with other team card
vik being genuinely happy seeing randy, callux and freezy is so sad cause we know how bored out of his mind he was
Tobi’s Elmo laugh brings me so much joy!
How has this video been viewed almost 2M times yet it came out 6 hours ago and the video is 3hrs long, thats madness hahaha
1:18:26 was one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time
I swear Ethan grabs his balls every video, is he pissing hot or something?
Vik is owed big time, hope on the next one it gets rectified. Banger video chaps!
Love the movie Style Editing!!
1:30:49 That embrace was powerful!
This really is a movie
give Vik a good team as well !!!
kasper is so funny 🤣
Am i the only one who watches these videos throughout the day lmfao?
Bruhhh just put Vikk and Harry in a good team for once already, they sure give us content for a bad team but they really look depressed. 🫤 JJ and Tobi didn't deserved to be on the good team for this vid
3 HOUR SIDEMEN VIDEO IS CRAZYYYYYY
LIKE MY BROTHERS LIKE THE VIDEO
Ethan and JJ bonding was so wholesome
Vik goat
JJ is too rich to be in the expensive teams.. he needs to be in the cheap team more than anyone else hahahah
:>
I need to preface this. I love the sidemen. Been watching since forever... but JJ's moaning is getting mad annoying. I guess money changes everyone a little. I hope it is just a character he plays and that he is better adjusted that this.
1:11:48 vik telling the security “it’s ok chill”
The perfect sidemen sunday
Sidemen cooked
Caspar is a beautiful genius
This video is 3 hours?? Wth
KSI didn’t deserve the nice holiday 😂
this video was brilliant, didn't feel like 3 hours at all I was creasing all the way through, and I'm glad that the bad team ended on some positives after having a rough experience 😂
I love how the video was longer than usual, Im 45mins into it and just checked to see how long I have left, just to find I still have 2hrs.  Keep it going boiis ❤
Dang! This is longer than a full fledged movie
THAT ENDING WAS SO WHOLESOME🥰
4:31 Bro said “NORMAL PEOPLE” 💀
Bro.... finnaly an amazing video that was focused on the crew and not just strangers doing something
27:50 Tobi ate that snow hard lolz !
I feel bad for the people on the bus. JJ was so mean 😢
An actual movie, well done sidemen
"The whites in my eyes went yellow and I got scared" 55:18  😭😭😭💀💀💀
That entire time Harry was complaining he could have been almost done, 😂
"The whites in my eyes turned yellow and I got scared" 😭😭😭💀💀💀
why is harry almost always on the bad team? hahahah i want him to be in the good team !!!
The guy teaching KSI Simon and Vik sounds like Richtofen
Ksi bro lose some wight brother u r fat
the clip at the end with them all laughing is a fr moment. me and the boys have done that. wish we recorded it like this❤️
1:18:26 Might be one of the greatest sidemen moments😂😂😂
This is so amazing the production of this video is like a movie and it three hours long. I love it amazing video!
1:12:32 harry is wild for that lmao
I really hope VIk gets the good team next time . I’m starting to feel bad for him
1:14:42 : what a vagina sees 1:18:34 : the sock 💀
KSI looking fat again lol
Vik is so wholesome 😊
Ethan getting more insufferable by the minute.
Ksi is ruining sidemen Sunday
bruh send me the details for the accom, that for $200 is cheap 😂
Ksi is ruining sidemen Sunday
THRWE HOURS
Ksi is ruining sidemen Sunday
Ksi is ruining sidemen Sunday
Ksi is ruining sidemen Sunday
Ksi is ruining sidemen Sunday
Ksi is ruining sidemen Sunday
Ksi is ruining sidemen Sunday
Ksi is ruining sidemen Sunday
Harry and his cheese
1:16:19 wtf
3 hours common we having a laugh
Skipped the whole video 😂
Really miss when they all drank was way more entertaining
Loved the cinematics and editing in this, making it look like a movie!
3 HOURS!
Should do a good vs bad holiday but plot twist is both teams get sent on a bad holiday
3 HOURS COME ONNNNNNNN
Ksi became lame and cringy
I can’t tell which is worse: JJ being annoying af on the good team or his constant crying when he’s on the bad team… moaning “i’m too rich for this”
This is honestly crazy, feels like a movie❤
Jj in lowbudget😂😂😂
The sidemen editors cooked on this one💯
How is Sidemen using copyrighted music? are they getting there money taken or are they doing something very smart?
JJ doing the monkey bars
Made my week or month, 3hr sidemen Sunday! Amazing! What a video
JJ on the good team: complaining*  JJ on the bad team: even more complaining*
whats wrong with KSI
Ending was so wholesome, especially the dark part
My favorite sideman Vikkstar123 My favorite OG gamer Vikkstar123 My favorite all time youtubers Speed and Vikkstar123 Vikk deserves more. he is legend. lots of LOVE and Respect  from NEPAL to Vikk
Honestly, one of my favorites!
42:05 new album cover  Trim, Payne, and Salt
Jj needs to sit more videos out, especially these type of videos
Don’t they have to get Visa’s? How do they just up and go?
The first Sidemen video that's more than 3 Hours long. Hoping to see more lengthy videos as well❤
This may go down in history as the greatest youtube video for eating and watching
WHEN THE TROOPS ROCKED UP, VIK LIT UP BLESS HIM
The audio at the end of them at night was amazing. Felt like a sleep over back in the back with your friends, to excited to sleep and everything is funny af. This is probably the best damn sidemen Sunday ever.
jjs laziness is honestly annoying now ruins the vids
Odds on Tobi finished with a happy ending 💀
1:51:27 nice Rick & Morty reference from Vik
Cashper is just SO GOOD.
I sat and watched this for 3 hours longer then I’d sit to watch a movie ❤love it
laughing and calling a fan a npc to their face is crazy
JJ needs to be humbled seriously in life. This is actually geting ridiculous.
Chef Nick was wholesome
Josh is the savage host😂
The “bad” team ain’t even bad let’s be real. Trip abroad learn to ski and enjoy time with ya pals… bro id love to be able to afford that
This was a SICK video! A PROPER MOVIE! Well done Crew for making something really special! Loved this whole thing, was smiling through most of it!
At the end we were just rinsing some extra content. Great video overall!
ksi completely ruined this
This was unbelievably well done. One of the best Sidemen Sundays yet.
3hrsssssaa
Nah they did JJ wrong
1:16:19 why did harry smell the sock 😂
The fact that got the right to use 24k magic is crazy.
This goes harddddddddd. Josh amazing video man. So sickkk ❤
2:16:41 weak 😂
36:22 that sniper had Simon marked
IM LITERALLY THE ONLY BLACK MAN DOING THIS- KSI
So no one talking about Harry smelling the sock at 1:16:19 🤣🤣🤣
3 hours is mental
WIKKSTAR123
1:01:55 harry sounds so much like a toddler here 😂😂
6:25.    14:03.    20:32.   25:21.    37:32.     52:33.   56:48.    1:01:37.    1:08:51.    1:11:03.    1:14:03.     1:21:20.   1:22:38.    1:46:56.    1:56:38.     Stopped at 2:08:00.  2:45:50    2:49:50.    2:50:12  2:54:03      2:54:34.    2:56:39   2:58:00
vik GOAT
Josh is a video master mind
This has just made me wanna do something like the cheap trip with the boys. A bond like the sidemen and the troops have is an amazing gift fr.
casper is a legend
Amazing video
JJ is the MVP of this video 😂
Long movie: ❌ 3 hour sidemen sunday: ✅
The obstacle course would have been sick to see jj do at peak boxing fitness lol
That intro music was fire ngl
the color grading on this one is insane!
52:50 Harry complaining and being irritated while Vik is out here planning a murder 😂
3 hour Sidemen Sunday… All we wished for
this is an amazing vid and it looks likes theres an upgrade in quality
Vikkstar looking fab in those fits ❤❤❤❤
The ending where they were talking in the dark was so hilarious 😂
Do Cheap VS Expensive Australia holiday
Bro TF three hour video?
Camera crew on bad team had the shakes????!? Why so wobbly!!
I can't breathe laughing so hard, Ethan asks if JJ knows  any french and man said "vroom" LMAOOOO
Ksi is indeed not a humble man
Viks villain arc will continue 😈
The ending is so much gold man! That felt like a real life sleepover and so authentic of all of them! 🙏🏼
1:00:06 here is a rare look from the outer orbit of KSI's forehead
what happened to kon
Any Kenyans here ❤
Love  this ❤
Dope intro and song. Keep it uo
I love cashper, hes like the new phil. So funny. Also knew to keep the energy up for the content. Legend
a 3 hour sidemen SUNDAY?! my prayers have been answered
For the record... Vik IS in fact there to do "challenges" or whatever is entertaining because it is his main job. Hes acting like SIDEMEN didnt provide his main source of income.
Who taught this man JJ micro aggressions 😂
@29:45 can't tell yous how badly I relate to Harry here 😂
Caspar was jokes hahah
2:23:11  Okay when Vik realizes there are people who do this for fun, he's gonna lose it 😂😂😂 (Me and my friends often go mountain climbing at night😂)
JJ is bulking again?😂😂😂
The outfits the cheap team were wearing are actually sick, what’s the brand ?
Sidemen show directors cut 😂 3 hours…. Jeeeez!
Harry smelled it 😂 1:16:20
1:16:17  Harry is built different, to go in head first and sniff the sock is crazy 😂😂💀🤦‍♂️
3hrs hell yeahhhhhh
At least the "bad" team in here doesn't really mean bad. That's a great vacation right there
Next Sidemen: onland sports vs water sports but in different countries. Like China Swinging bridge game vs Tree Felling game
unreal
I swear Josh has got to be one of the best in the YouTube game at original ideas amazing
Casper is amazing 😂😂😂😂
I mean the end was very warmful with the boys having a sleepover
Sidemen be working!!!! Fellas it’s okay to take some time off to yourself. Don’t overwork yourself
Kasper is a legend 😂
1:15:57 the nice lady gave Harry a sock! Harry is Freee
Why’s no one talking about Casper, bro was hilarious him and JJ was such a good duo lmao
2:33:29 that sounded HELLA PAINFUL
The editors 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best sidemen sunday in my opinion
Realistically JJ should’ve been DQ’d from the obstacle course. Took a snowmobile ride from being too slow then was too lazy to do the monkey bars
Brother 3 hour long video
This Casper guy is great
Editors lowkey went crazy on this one
KSI's downfall is that belly he has put on. They already won!😂🤣
harry running across the bridge with the music had me creasing man🤣
This might be the best Sidemen Sunday yet
Randy's stand up is guna haunt me ..
1:16:19 he just sniffed the sock bro
Its like watching sidemen movie
We need more long-form content like this man and no not on side+
2:17:59  I love how Ethan never lose his true self :))❤️ He's always grateful for every wonderful moment whether he's in the good team or the bad team..
What a video
I like that Josh 1:29
Anyone tell me where this is please??
vik taking the camera from the cameraman who was struggling while skiing is so wholesome and sweet
what a video!!
forget KISIMON its time for KSCASHPUR
2:16:40 I couldn't breath, the editing and shot were perfect 😂😂😂😂
End of this video killed me 😂
the good team is always the same ppl. get harry vika and simon to enjoy it for once
How come konstantin wasn’t anything todo with this one then?
2:16:42  New memeee 🎉
Casper was hilarious should definitely have him back
cmon clowning the fan smh
JJ calling the people NPCs in the bus was hilarious I legit could not breathe😂
Little things like the intro and the end credits are so sick.  Even if the video was shorter, those details truly make it feel like such a professional production.  Well done editors!!
Genuinely sick video, 10/10 😂
JJ is the least likable guy i can think of
We’ve all seen so many different intros on this channel and just in general… but I gotta admit this was one of the best because I felt invigorated just watching the first Minute! 👏👏 this is gonna be a great ride 👍🏻
Need more Cashpa
Harry sniffing the sock at 1:16:19 had me dying
Nah the last part got me dead
It was good but Crazy I’ve just finished watching it I started it yesterday 🤣
Loved this vid so much ❤❤❤
LETT MEE OUT! I AM TOO RICH FOR THIS!!- JJ, 2024
2:16:40 caught me offgaurd
Cheap vs Expensive vs Josh is a shout for a future video idea!
sidemen released a movie
Why doesnt vikk host if hes been on so many bad teams
Getting boring now having JJ whinge EVERY video
SIDEMEN HAVE MUSIC RIGHTS FOR THIS VID HOLYYYY BRUNO MARS
I've been hoping for a banging holiday vid like this for a while. 3 hours is phenomenal!
The content, the length, everything was amazing. But honestly what really made this was the edit and the use of licensed music. So many great tracks that fit so many moments perfectly, particularly the credits at the end.
2:12:48  Wow👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Incredible
ksi just too rude
I love cashpur
Unpopular opinion: Tobi is the best sideman in every way, looks, personality and charisma.
Never thought the editors would use a Fatboy Slim track but here we are and I’m loving it.
Bro that b-roll at 18:13 is so sick and smooth
One of the best cheap vs expensive 🔥🔥
Amazing sidemen sunday video.
Best video yet ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I enjoyed Sidemen videos more when KSI was busy with other things.
2:11:52  JJs form is KILLING ME😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Love how they both teams some how ended up playing wavelength at the end. Quality video lads really enjoyed it
Heck yeahh! Banger is an understatement. 3 hours of sidemen Sunday? Yessir!!!
I LOVE IT
Casper has been one of my favorite parts of the video
Sleepover was the best part. Sleepovers with the boys are always funny
I can't lie this was one of the best ones ever Day 2 slapped well done boys great work
2:19:20 the sadness is real for vik.
The bedtime content at the end had me dying 😂😂 amazing video, well worth the 3 hours! 50/10.
Oh these lot are unbareable all they do is take mic out of poor people
it dosent really sit right with me how thye kept presuring harry to drink
FATNEEK IS BACK HE KEEPS HIS TITLE CLEAN!!!!!!!!!
3h of sidemen😍
W vid
JJ and Casper were such a funny combo
3 hours of sidemen Sunday yes please 👌
Why does Randy’s Jesus impression sound like Michael Jackson
Why am I having flashbacks with Ethan on the swing
2:16:39 Attack on Titan looking a bit different
53:00 it’s still not funny the second time Vik
That intro to the good team was fire! The views, the motion work and cinematic shots....uff magic! And the fire song aswell!
NEXT VIDEO IDEA 48 HOURS IN A TROPICAL COUNTRY SOUTHEAST ASIA EDITION THEN JUST GO ISLAND HOPPING WHITE WATER RAFTING FIND ANIMALS IN THE WILD ETC. THAT VIDEO WILL BE NUTS
3hrssssssss 🤣🥹🥹🙌🙌
YES!!!!!! KSI AND ETHAN GOOD TEAM… I LOVE WATCHING KSI ON GOODTEAM… ETHAN ON GOOD TEAM W KSI IS CLUTCH… YES ETHAN!!!!
that face of JJ.. ''Wtf was that broo,, Yooo what was that? Something on the roof brooo...'' hahahaha
Why do I feel like Harry is almost always on the cheap team lol
Since last Sidemen Sunday it seems that JJ and Vik don't have the greatest relationship. Not beef but they seem like they aren't as close as everyone else.
What a banger again, those keep getting and better :D ❤
3 hours long? Yeeeeee boi
3 hrs? Sit back and watch a masterclass sidemen movie
idk why but the outro made it so much better
The production on this video was on point. It was amazing from start to finish. The soundtrack from Fatboy Slim was a perfect fit for the animations and the ending cinematic.
my gosh simon is such a spoil sport  acting like such a cuck
It's crazy ksi still has fans
This just might be the best YouTube video ever made
JJ needs to get back down to earth its a shame tbh
Nah Vikk is an absolute legend! Man has not been on the good team for eons & still has the best attitude.
best sideman video ever released
The JJ's reaction to salad 😂😂😂
If jj and tobi aren't on the bad team next time imma be pissed
1:01:38 me after any form of exercise 😂😂😂
Simon minter he bottled the top 😂
Casper was absolutely hilarious in this video. Was so good with the boys.
Simon🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭 Tonight was a movieeeeeeee😭😭😭
It's such a Harry thing to do to sniff the sock the woman gave him @ 1:16:19
6:28 translation is crazy
Anyone else notice Harry smelling the sock😂
Big steve gets to live the best body guard dreams ever. Lol
10:59 vik so cute!
2:16:44 Calfreezy
They should stop with these spoiler thumbnails
Not Harry smelling the sock
Is this the first time that they have used a copyright song?
Only ther 2days and Toby got in a long term relationship with the masseuse 😂
The Diving competition killed me 😂
Come on boi
1:18:21, 38:13, 39:47, 2:58:01 were so funny omfg I cried
The editing of this video perfect❤
Y did harry smell the women’s sock😂😂
One of the best videos on this channel!
A masterpiece sidemen Sunday
why was simon tight harry took 1 pepperoni, majorly trippin 😂
Banger Vid!! Intro and Outro were cold, keep up the good work lads (Josh in the edit).
I find it kinda funny how I called who was sleeping where on both teams
Justice for Vik honestly. Has gotten so many bad holidays and he is such a big skier and none of the guys chose him to switch. Vik needs a good team holiday
can we please please please get another come dine with me the other 1 banged boys and i think every1 would agree with me that it would slap again
that ski instructor was the funniest thing ive seen in a video in a long time lmfaoo
It’s 2 am so it’s gona be 5 am wen I finish
Ethan’s grip on the line second time round seemed sturdy. He’s getting the hang of it 😂💪
This was so epic I loved the credits at the end big ups to the production becoming amazing !
Real ones were watching when JJ made the GTA video where he said "Doggie" lol
Ty bros
Caspers elite
Casper is the best part 😂
Where is Simon
Why does Casper remind me of the guy in the orange suit from Despicable Me?
Harry sniffed the sock😂
Kasper “Yaaaaa Vicky” 😂😂 Such an amazing character
The boys do Vik so dirty all the time man. Bro was violently ill a couple days before this and still showed up. Give the guy a break.
SIDEMEN USING PARADISE 😍😍😍😍😍😍
jj is unbearable either way
This is an amazing style of content, i hope this is normalised
unreal
Am i right or is this the new longest sidemen video up to date?
Anyone else mad that KSI and Ethan kinda acted all spoiled and ended up getting the better of the two
The end credits is a very nice touch, amazing 🔥
Proud to say I made it thru the 3 hours
Nah that's probably one of the best sidemen Sunday's I've watched felt the rollercoaster ride of emotions 😂😂 JJ and cashper shipped more than ksimon did that's mad 😂😂😂😂
The credits made me feel like as if its the end of sidemen 😢💔😂
When’s the next sidemen strength test dropping?
Felt really bad for vik, he's never got a Good team
1:24:50 "give them a kiss goodnight, go on." "Alright that was a bit weird" 😂
I feel for VIkk. He got no votes from his friends. maybe because they think he would be fine regardless of the team he's in
3 HOURS LONG?!   Yeah lemme go get ChickfilA & a snack😂😂
3 hour video 🥰 I'm here for it 🥰
I thought Harry would be in his element surrounded by white powder! 😂
19:42 another camera
Tobi on the barsss 👀👀
Where was Tobi 😂
What A Cold Video!
Good content
big up the sidemen editors they smashed this
2:16:04 “a lil bit of chase” had me creasing😂
Why can’t they leave JJ alone lol 😂 they gloat to him all the time
Casper is HILARIOUS man. He was JJ’s karma 100% lol
Zerka vid ayeee
Brother, the worst part of the video is finding out jj is on the good team
This was basically USA road trip 2.0
9:20 the guy's hands is shaking probably from ethan's loud laugh 😂😂
8:40 really funny but Jesus KSI is really detached from reality kinda sad
We need more casper
I loved this 3 hrs special!!! do it more often
1:18:14
where was Kon and Kirsty in this video? First video in years without them two filming.
Team bad team
Kasper legend
Harry sniffing that sock 😂😂
Harry sniffing that sock 😂😂
13:50 Linkin Park vibs
This style for sidemen Sundays is elite!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just want my comment to be here in 3 years showing I seen their new most viewed video when it was released
1:16:16 CAUGHT IN 4K
WE NEED MORE AMONG US!!!
Who tf is that guy who walks around with jj like a cuck… get him out of the cam we dont wanna see that dude
The hardest part about watching these Cheap vs Expensive videos is watching your favorite Sidemen being on the bad team.
Love the longer video formats, really had a great time watching this. 🤙
15:20 the ads are going ham
Amazing video, but can y'all do windows next time? like near the end, Freezy was just behind JJ but he should have been between JJ and Lux!  --top tier vid nonetheless!
This one hit different🥲
2:16:40 When she says she's home alone.
dang jj let himself go
3 hours Yh it’s lit
3 hours almost makes me wanna take a day off work
This gotta be one of the best sidemen Sundays 😭😭😭
2:16:40 AOT
bro thats three hours .. thats like two movies .. or one Indian movie
What's the song at the start.
I’m sorry but personally this video has made me want to never meet KSI, I’d rather meet harry or Simon
the ending was so wholesome and absolutely hilarious!
3 hours 😮
"I'm too rich for this, he said HOSTEL" 😂😂😂
feels like a genuine movie, well done sidemen crew
This was better than any movie i have ever watched
Big ups to Ethan! Man is really out here looking Jacked
Felt like watching a film soooo good man
The editing is really awesome
1:16:19 Harry is a WILD man
Can y’all not be 🍆’s and peer pressure someone who’s trying to stop drinking into doing it? Honestly very disappointing and disgusting
Great video, and for some reason, the use of actually music makes a massive difference 👏🏻
I enjoyed it
bro why does jj treat random ppl like npcs😭😭
1:01:41 this is gonna be a clip I’m going to see about 100 times on shorts in the next 2 weeks 😂
that was trash for 3 hours jj is just crying the whole vid and vik is just friendless. harry ethan and tobi are too stacked a team spread the energy around. never thought i would write this, poor simon.
Casper is not a real person 😂
Best produced sidemen Sunday absolute banger of a video!
yeah this is the best video they've ever made
Crying at them all sleeping at the end
14:05 crazy
WE NEED MORE OF THOSE!
This is how I learn the boys' names🤯
Harry taking a sneaky with of the random women’s sock 😂
Since when did Cruger edit for Sidemen?
One of the best films this channel has produced. Congrats on the success.
The shoot of Harry running across the bridge had me dying
Kiss of life 😂😂😂
Sidemen makeover when kinda wanna see yall either switch styles or just hire chep vs expensive makeover
jon knocking on the door and one of the roommates answering was too funny
This looks so dope
3h no thx bey
1:04:50 That geezer was ready to punch Simon up
3 hour video jesus
The Sidemen & Friends Movie
2:25:12 harry is the only person i know that will risk injury for a laugh 😂
Songs from Fatboy Slim and Caesars to the boys skiing gave crazy nostalgia to the proper old vlogs. Absolutely smashing choices from the editors. 🙌
the bit at the end had me crying omg
What a wholesome ending, feels like i just watch a happy ending of a movie❤
3 hours? are we acoustic?
the ending acc gave me goosebumps man
2:50:00 vik was the only one seems to be happy to see fellow troops
2 mins in and I am glad JJ is there, first made me worried that JJ's complaining (or gloating but thats rare cause he always gets the bad ones) wasn't going to be in this. He makes these videos fun 🤣
3 hours long is mad
44:00 them being so slow getting off that thing was so relatable lol
big up josh this was sick
Why is harry always on the good team lmao... it always ends up with him on the good team.
3 hours of sidemen sunday is mad haha, but im up to it, i might be watching the video on separate days but im gonna damn sure finish it.
Kinda mean to call those chaps NPCs KSI
4:33 normal people😂
A 3 hour vid is mad... more mad than my girl when I'm tryn to watch this oppenheimer competitor 😮😮
In the first night the good team eat good food and just run around a chalet and go in a pool sauna.   Meanwhile the bad team are running around a ski village doing chaotic things with strangers.   I know which team I'd rather be on
Epic laughed so many times watching this ❤
That intro was 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's sweet that josh hung out with the cheap team though
6 hosts vs josh each host picks something for him to do including a long list which would mostly be drinking (peer pressure).
I love how the bad team always say they can't be asked then later enjoy the tasks 😂
sidemen putting songs in their vids
The production was up this video! Felt like a movie
3 hours is crazy
THE BEST VIDEO.
back in my day red team was sacred in holiday videos and it was JJ tobi and simon
Josh is elite when it comes to planing vids
3hrs damn
Nah they have officially leveled up again
No way he sniffed the sock😂
this 2 days, good and bad team is really good hope we see more of this
2:58:07 is tooo funny
ruins the point if the bad team does not actually sleep at the place they go to
tf did vik say🤣
2:58:24 nah randolph killed me😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭
This is wat we need every Sunday man 2 to 3 hour videos
Only thing I dont like is peer pressure Harry into drinking hes trying to better himseld
This was one of the more wholesome sidemen sunday videos they've put out in a while.
holy that ski instructor was annoying af, I understand he was trying to be funny but it made the experience so much less enjoyable to watch
Two masterpieces in a row😍😍
Josh hosted? Already know it’s a banger!
I dont like watching JJ in these videos just my personal opinion don't get violent with me in the replys
Growing up watching the boys sometimes I forget they are millionaires, I was reminded today when I liked Tobi’s camo fit went to check it out on undefeated lol and immediately was humbled 😂😂
Where’s Simon gone
.                                        .
We all gonna skip over harry sniffing the sock???? 😭😭😭
Sadly I can’t take much of csi . I rather enjoy everyone else
Yeah, I think this might be the best Sidemen video by far, so entertaining. This video just made my day 100x better. Absolutely amazing video  ♥
3hr video, sidemen are the best
Ngl the bad team snow suits were sick
Casper is my favorite on my life
New favorite sidemen Sunday video ❤
I love Cashpar, smoking cigars whilst doing the zip line like a G 😂
The ending was really sweet awh, loved the video❤
I feel like Simon, vik and harry here dressed like the Just Dance dancers
The ending was the best I actually liked the ending more than the rest of the movie 😂😂😂
1:53:14 That’s karma JJ!! 😂😂😂
EPIC 🔥
W vid
The amount of gravity KSI experiences on earth is all the downfall he will ever need 🤣
Bit sad that lux, freezy and randy werent in the whole video😊
Should have less of JJ moaning and crying, ruins thr fun
1:16:18 not harry sniffing the sock😭
Tbh bad team suits were fire
3 hours vid is crazy but I can't wait to watch BTS ❤
“Thankyou my lady” Harry’s the best man 🫶
3HS brov 😂
Forhead go bro 😂 jj man
This was a Good Movie to watch
Loved every single second of this❤😂
Did that old drunk dude swing at Simon? lol I just saw the security step in and the cut after he charged up for the second one
broo the montage in this video is nice
Absolutely great video I hope we get another 3hr video sometime in the future.
Has Ethan been on a diet or is it just me?
Harry in the bad team is a dislike from me
3hrs is crazyyy
Editor just did ksi dirty with the "i feel fat" edit😂
Tobi what's wrong with milton keynes
Vik needs a good team holiday💔 I love him, he always stays positive 😢
This was one of the greatest shoots thanks sidemen!
The best 3 hours of my morning…😊
vikk is the best man, bless him. loved the video, idk if it is recency bias but this was as good or maybe even better than the European holiday. everyone was amazing today
Poor vik every time in the bad team 😢
12:15 Definitely not looking at the satnav🤣🤣
If Harry would have voted Vik for the swap it would have been so wholesome
43:15 JJ while eating a dead pig
33:42 This look like poxn scene 😂
The music in this Sideman Sunday is fire🔥🔥
The actors on the bus were poor
Instant classic
Those late night chats are the best, some of the funniest things happen in those moments!!!
Icl the longer the vids the better so keep making long vids 😂😂
Vik being very sick just two days before this and ending a sidemen shoot early and getting zero votes to switch teams is so sad lol would have been nice.
Not the late night talks in the end XD
42:14 JJ sounded like an alien lmfaooo
3 hours 🤯🍆
This video might hit the top 10 for me . Keep up the grate videos
Does anyone know what cashpur was saying in German?
Love Tobi but he needs to go on the bad team in the next several
All props to Simon for keeping positive on the bad team!! Did a good job keeping up morale for the boys and not complaining like the others!!
3hrs!?
Best Sidemen Sunday
at the end of the day, JJ laughed more than he would have if he stayed on the good team. this is in the run for best sidemen sunday so far this year. we need more long videos
Nah the last part of the guys talkin while trying to sleep is jokes. It’s just nonsense but at that hour at night everything is funny
that npc scene had me crying 😂😂😂😂😭💯
Life is so bad in a moncler ski suit jj 👏👏
Next time say that there is a good team but there isn't one. And then in another video where there are only 2 good teams.
Is it me or is Tobi and KSI mad sus this video
These guys are killing it
3 hours of sidemen Sunday is nuts
40:25 First, the migro. Second, the monkey bars. Now this? 😭
The bad team seemed like genuine fun
After last sunday's shitshow I thought the sidemen are on their dying arc, seems like its a redemption arc afterall
FATNEEK IS BACK
why harry smell her sock tho
Good Holiday Idea: Both Teams compete for the good team. Prob have both teams do challenges and whichever team does them all first gets the good team and the losers go to the crappy team. But dont tell them that they won or lost, just give them the card.
Randolph has been watching too much kill Tony.
Jj was NOT happy about stalker John
The way jj was genuinely shaking on that zip line
This felt like a grand tour episode and i love it
1:14:53 Instant Ethan😆
The intro was SICK!
38:16 Lettuce feeling violated fr
Yall getting more and more professionals with filming, planning, commercials, etc  Goats of YouTube groups
Respect to Vikk he actually really tried this time to keep it together and try to have some fun for a long time :D
Harry running across the bridge with that camera angle made it
Watched this whole video in one sitting. Class stuff as usual boys
Just got in from work, I've been waiting all day to watch this - LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Enjoy it so much
felt like i was watching a film
Best sidemen Sunday this year I think
Thanks to the credits I learned that Randy is actually an Andy
Jj rude calling them npc
1:26
In every video ethan always hella selfish its also always him that’s laughing and pointing at vik ive noticed
Sidemen video of the year, for now👀🔥🎥
Its my birthday
I pray Josh's little "wheel" puts Ethan & JJ land on the bad team the rest of 24
Okay whoever has the edits now and add fatboy slim (artist ) in the beginning intro. Needs a raise
3 hours is shockimg and fun
3 hour's straight of sdmn its now 01:15am goodnight
Video idea, both teams just go on a bad holiday and then another vid, both teams go on a good holiday
I love the fact that my first pop up on google search is "randolph real name" since this aired lmao
The bad team looks way more fun to be on. good team is an hour of jj screaming and sitting around.
VIK IS BEST 💛
Sidemen using the fat boy slim music at the start and the end rate it tbh
The real question is was it Vik or Simon snoring 👀?
Vik deserves a good team man. No one voted him to get promoted to the good team when he already gets the bad team for all the big holidays essentially
What a load of nothing… last 5 mins is the only genuine bit
I WISH that cost $200
DO A 48 hour stranded video with @Outdoor Boys 🤣 that video would bang💪🏽
Crazy they got 3 hours when the bad team was so sour.
Honestly… AMAZING video💯🔥 from start to end
23:53 RIP Ad revenue 😂
Vik plotting to kill 😂
Harry smelling the sock is absolutely insane  🤣 1:16:12
3 hrs ???
WHAT A BANGER!
im convinced that jj is always on the good team just so they don't have to hear him cry n complain the whole time 😂
harry's relationship with the cheese was a rollercoaster of emotions
The fact that loads of people are just finishing the vid now lol
Best Host = josh always
Get this man 500,00 LIKES ❤
Definetly should of done a last minute switch on them when they where eating, it would of made this video a million times better, KSI and Tobi on good teams is getting old.
KSI getting taken out by the snow whilst skiing is me when anything inconvenient happens in my life.
ksi
Kasper is gold 😂😂
43:21 me watching this on ramadan 🫣
Why wasn’t Simon in the 2nd day?
The ending!!! Damnn, actually reminded me of trips w my friends, where we all went crazy laughing at the most stupidest things. 🔥💯🔥💯
2 hours 3mins in the absolute banger of a fifa came on🫶👌 brang back so many good old memories man 😂 w video btw guys
Just got to end of first day and night and fort this is a long vid looked 3 hour ya nice lads
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
What a video
OHHHHH MY GODDDDDDDDDDD
so well edited together some great wholesome content its another great video <3
OH MY GOD 3 HOUR VIDEO
3hr sidemen video lets go!!!!
23:55
Casper was pure gold  Honestly kept JJ in check
The shock Harry and Josh must’ve had going from the Maldives to the mountains
this was actually a movie
Big up the editors
1:08:00 HAD M E CRYING !!
3hr video my life is complete
JJ looking more and more like 2024 John jones by the day
HELLLPP😭 WHY THE FCK DID HARRY SMELL THAT RANDOM LADY’S SOCK 1:16:19 😭😭
The close up camera angles when JJ took the obstacle course got me good
poor vikk 😭
I do find it funny that KSI of all people calls other people NPC's
honestly enjoy the bad teams content better
Lowkey the end of video was the best part😂
The made a movie
This was a movie
Brilliant vid once again from the puppet master josh only negative is when u was on the phone with the bad team your audio was dogshite couldn't hear anything from your end
What a guy Kasper is. 😂
i love him! the Casper dude is amazing.
When ethan and jj walked in on tobi 😂💀
Vik got VIOLATED 1:16:49
Had to do a double take and make sure this was actually a 3 hour video and then proceeded to bust a nut.
A 3 hour long video 🥵
Gave up after 45 minutes. There’s no chance I’m watching a 3 hour YouTube video
This is the perfect ending to this series. There's nothing else they can do to change and make them exciting and its a banger so I think it's the perfect time to end it before they overdo it like they very nearly did with Tinder or 20v1. They're very close too, the bad team very clearly didn't want to participate after the halfway point
got an hour in and checked if i was almost done and then realized its 3 HOURS 😮😮
3 HOURS?! LETS GOOOO
Harry saying he hates Denmark to the danish ppl actually killed me 😭
Poor Vik… again.
Faith is gonna have a whole new thing to threaten to break up with Ethan over with than synchronised swimming
Josh videos are actually nice
1:16:49 sent meee 😂😂😂
This was the best sidemen Sunday ever made well done josh
Anyone else catch harry take a whiff of the sock 1:16:21
No one voting Vik was peak. JJ voting for his boyfriend and Ethan voting for his boyfriend proves how cliquey the boys are at the end of the day lmao
This is peak YouTube/peak sidemen/ OP/GOAT vid ever. End of debate their the best!!!!!
Vik im only 15
1:14:48 😂😂
1:16:20 bro really sniffed ‘em 😭😭
Goated video
Feel like Josh needs a big congratulations on the producing and directing of this, absolutely loved it. Great edits aswell, best video I’ve seen so far in terms of visual. Definitely up there in Top 10 videos of all Sidemen’s time. 👏🫶 definitely feel for Vik this time though. Looking forward to him being on the good team next time 🤞
Bro what was the last 5 mins 🤣🤣🤣
from ow on Zerkaa should always take on the big budget shoots, he does an excellent Job!
big boy jj
3 hour sidemen Sunday wtf damn
1:16:17 harry having a quick sniff xD
I usually watch sidemen Sunday at like 1am so I go on yt and find that it's 3 hours! Collage gonna be a libg tired day later 😂
tobi needs to be on a bad team icl
I love that it felt like a 50 min video, even though its longer than most movies. And the credits at the end aswell! The view from the "hanging" bridge actually made me tear up, haha, would love to go there someday!
JJ deserves to be at the good team sometimes because most of the time he's in the bad team
are we not gonna talk about the mcdonalds? BOYCOTT!!!!!!! im so disappointed man
Crazy that both teams ended up playing wavelength at night
Only the Sidemen could put out a 3 hour video and I would stop what I'm doing and watch every second of it lol
Harry sniffing the Lady's sock is hilarious 1:16:18 😭😭
Best sideman sunday
Nice
We’re is this Scotland?
The ending was very nice. Just a group of friends making jokes. Going to bed cracking some more jokes before they go to sleep. And have a good morning wake up.
1:17:36 JJ: 📢📢📢🚨🚨🚨🚨
Epic video, 3 hours of cinema. This might be my new favorite Sidemen Sunday video.
Proud to admit, i watched the full 3 hrs, doing course work, made it a lot less like torture ❤❤
New challenge, take a shot every time JJ says he wants to die 😂
Put Vik on a Todd team
“when did i?” “how did i” “i cbf” I LOVE VIK AHAHAHAHHAA
toby sounds like elmo when he laughs
1:16:19 harry went in for a sniff 😭
Ngl Josh and the boys smashed it with this video.
THE SNORING AND HARRY'S REACTION TOOK ME OUT🤣💀
34:21 cute chick just admiring Harry 😂❤
Almost clicked off cause I didn't see jj
Best video I've seen in ages, well done Josh, bloody brilliant. Don't think we expect 3 hour videos all the time but that was excellent
Can we give some appreciation to Josh for putting this altogether 🔥
'these guys look like some prime Rock Paper Scissors losers' Simon would definitely win in a roast battle
Why JJ has to ruin some parts of the vid ...banger vid apart from JJ being weird in some moments
2:02:42 ~where I left,goodnight
The only way this video could've been improved was if Phil was waiting for them at the bottom of the slope.
Mid video regurgitating challenges
I hear fatboyslim, i like
jj just went from 90kg to 125kg in one sitting haha big ups man
JJs breakdown was very immature when he first entered the coach. Acted very obnoxiously and probably made everyone uncomfortable
The worst part was finding out Cashpur wasn't his actual name
They've just restarted Vik's villain arc all over again here with the no votes
“Someone call the police” 😂 JJ has been violated.
3 hours, what a treat <3
Vik villain arc part 2?...
9:20 i cant bro  LMAO
Love Simon’s humour 😂😂
1:41:40 this is what im here for mans was too gassed
What a banger
giant ksi, 1:17:49
I’m gonna have to watch this in episodes 😂😅
Always long Videos like this please 😊
Jj needs to chill god damn
This is a whole movie 🎉🎉
Man that was like a movie, fully enjoyed that
Ksi deserved the bad team for how he was acting, thats what some people had been excited for for months and hes just mocked them
Our fatneek is back🥹
are we not gonna talk about how harry sniffed the sock that the woman gave her 😂
3hours sidemen director cut! I am a simple man i see sideman i click and i enjoy.
1:59:11 is crazy bro. Like the ending to JJs secret P*rn video
Wow 😮 what a video best 3hrs of my life
Return of Fatneek
Minute 2:16:40 is my favorite part of the video
We need a sidemen camping in Alaska with Outdoor Boys
I can’t breathe this German man vs JJ is the best interaction I have seen in a long timeee😂 He goes “come to me VaJJ”😭
I think Josh and Simon should jointly host a Sidemen Sunday.
nah the GoPro on JJ during the obstacle course was a violation
I cannot believe this is 3 hours!!! I’m so exited!!!
the credits was amazing touch made it feel so amazing i sat throught the whole thing!!
1.5 ms in 4 hours wow the sidemen got it
9:20 "Look at the phone he's got..nah he's an NPC" said JJ to a man holding a $1300 dollar phone
Glad Caspar is back
P.O.V IF I WAS [.Invited.]
Did harry sniff that sock? 😂😂😂
I love vik, doesn’t get the respect and loce he deserves. He is actually so funny and such a good youtuber❤❤
Ahhh, yes, where the Geneva Check List is from 🇨🇦😂
I genuinely enjoy these long videos. I feel like I get to watch a new movie every week.
I don’t know why I relate to Harry and his cheese so much but I do 😂
Harry running across the bridge with the 360 camera had me dying 😂😂
SWZILLE😂😂😂😂
This was awesome!!!
Enjoy your break big dawg.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE EDITING AND CAMERA WORK IT WAS AMAZING 🫶
Best vid I’ve seen in agessss on YouTube
way to long and kinda boring tbh
1:16:19 Harry smelling the sock has killed me off 😂😂😂
sick edit and loved the video ! The troops at the end on the morning felt compeling and a great way to end the shoot !
3 hours sidemen sunday🤩🤩
Nah the drone footage with paradise playing in the back. There was just something about it
THE INCREDIBLE LOVE BETWEEN FRNDS <3
1:00:00  This POV is amazing 😂😂
what a video, felt every emotion and the ending was so wholesome
JJ really gets annoying by complaining like bro isn't in a place where 99% of the world will never get to go
Second comment... best sidemen video ever❤
Put JJ on the “good team” but make him do zip lines and such. I bet he gets hyped up for it just because he’s on the good team
this is a movie big up the production
Sidemen Sunday > Oppenheimer
This is the sort of video we all want
I'm just waiting for a holiday video where both teams are the "Bad Team"
Come to eindhoven in the netherlands
Best sidemen Sunday in a while
59:08 OMG Josh's the sweetest 🥺❤️
The boys sleepover at the end is so nostalgic, the best and funniest memories always originate at sleepovers with the boys
That shot of the walkway bridge is so SICK 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
3 HOURSSS YESSSSS OMGGGG
Initially i wanted jj and ethan to be on the good team but the way jj was acting i though "i really hope he has to camp in the snow struggling to keep his fire lit". Jj deserves a dreadful experience now.  Edit: he got what was coming to him, lol
why vic never on a good team?
42:11 JJ sound like a movie villain
Plz I am crying at JJ and the man putting his face in the snow 😂💀🤣🤣🤣
Let's go❤️❤️
Nah that npc walk is so accurate tho
the head gopro on jj during the race LMAO.
#TeamVik❤
3 hoursssss YOO WHAT A WWWW
My mind just exploded learning that cashpur is played by an english actor and not an actual zesty german man
that pause 😂 14:10
Absolutely brilliant, Thanks again guys.
Vik is wholesome and cheerful I love him man
Kasper is so dope! 😂
Banger of a video lads
Shame for Harry on the skis, slightly feel like it the bad team was planned last second😂
3 hour long video wow ❤
Great video
I like how they added the credits it was a nice touch ❤
The fact that this is longer than most movies is insane! Well done lads 👏🏽
Took the day off work to watch this 😂❤
KSI moaning at 1:17:34 killed me😂
1:15:57
ngl i wanna see jj ethan and harry on bad team at the same time, it’s never happened
ye
im dead they prayed on JJs downfall and they succeeded 💀💀💀
We can see real JJ if he gets on the bad team. Money has corrupted in him mind.
A 3hr vid god damn they cooked
KSI is becoming an insufferable diva...check his testosterone levels..
Great ending to the video
Nah the Editor COOKED🔥🔥🔥Big up Josh for always bringing us BANGERS🙌❤‍🔥
Am I the only one surprised they got to use the songs they did in the video😭
It's pretty easy to figure out the good team. Usually it's going to be the team that suck JJ is on!
Josh is the bestt
Why does Tobi sound like Elmo when he laughs?
No kon or kirsty 😢
As an introvert, i felt Harrys feelings tremendously regarding that list. I would want to end it all too and ruin the whole trip 😂
58:51  Intrusive thoughts won.
we need more jj in bad team
The music used for this video is🔥🔥🔥
Nah Josh 23:55 Why is there a song with the N-word when the Nigerians are on screen?
That didn't felt like 3 hrs lol.. <3 loved harry and ethan's water dance.
1:20:35 "I've got a human sock" I think most socks are human socks Harry
KSI still eating McDonald's ?
Honestly never laughed so much, Ethan, JJ and Tobi are so funny, 3 top Nigerians 😂
3hrs its a fckin moive boys
1:01:47  vik 💀💀💀
7:55 "Hey look it's sunny " killed me bro
Might be a controversial take but I think that might be the best sidemen video I’ve ever watched
JOSH COOOOOOOKED! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
“Are we going to Milton Keynes”😂
Tobi looks like krillz
what is the name of the place the good team stayed at?
12:23 free Palestine, boycott mcdonalds
Any chance of sending me on one of those expensive vacays?
🐐
Fatneek is back!
the drone shots over the bridge and all around cinematography is stunning (and even gave me the chills).. props to all the behind the scenes crew, videographers, and editors who made this amazing video!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼
This was a really good video the editing team went above and beyond with this it must have taken so long so yeah credit to the editing team
We’ve gotta make this the new most viewed sidemen video it’s only fair…
Sidemen video nowadays is like movie
W freaking video💯
i feel sorry for the "npc" must have felt confusing lol but enjoyed the entertainment nonetheless.
1:01:39 The editor did JJ fvckin diiiiirty! 😭🤣
Why’s Tobi not in the video?
This was a movie! Even the text rolling down at the end
1:16:18 the whiff
1:03:57 sly lil Harry Potter reference there Harry 😂
16:40 harry got Toby's big nose
Before I clicked on YouTube I said I bet this video is gonna be short turns out I was quite wrong
so proud of how far the sidemen have come, as friends and utubers
Josh, the editors, and the cameramen cooked 🔥on this video. Props to them 👏
2 hours in while gaming and I just realized this video is three hours lol
14:04  Ethan playing a risky game😂😂 especially sitting right next to Tobi and jj
What a fuckin video
blessed with a 3 hour video
JJ should be on the bad team next time around for forfeiting using the snowmobile. Tobi needs to be on the good team next time around been done dirty multiple times imo
1:16:16 harry smelling the sock 😂 then vick asking does it smell 😂😂
Don't wanna sound negative, but laughing in someone's face and calling him an npc is not part of a real Man's character.
3 hours?!?! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
this legit is a movie
Zerka has no audio 54:32
banger
Video idea :  £50,000 vs £500 holiday with 2 side + fans
Unreal video 👏👏
@1:16:19 wtf Harry Kinda Sus HAHA WTFF why did he have to smell it
33:40 yooo that hair style on JJ looks fire! So used to him with his hair up, should totally wear it down sometimes
25:47- "When do I, What did I, How did I"  -Vikstar
Absolutely loved this!
I feel bad for Vik man it’s actually annoying to see him get screwed everytime
The outfits Simon, Harry and Vik had to wear while getting pizza were amazing 😂
At this point Josh should always be the director he always cooks
54:36 audio is messed up
Harry smelled the sock😭😭
Why not come to norway huh
Music name 0:44   ?
the 3 hours were definitely worth the watch!
Its gonna be a banger 🌟🌟
Randys set at the end was the craziest ending.
this vid is fr an 8th of my day ahaha
The amount of unskippable ads in this vid is ridiculous
Banger as always
Very enjoyable 3 hours loved it. Watched every minute of it
Plux it out z
2:16:39 that has just jumpscared me beyond belief, attack on titan ahh run
holy moly 3 hour sidemen video is crazy we in for a journey with this one
2 hours too long..
Ya Vicky? Ya HAHAHAHA
Josh's holiday videos are the best
BIG JOSHER COOKED
This has to be the greatest sidemen Sunday ever icl
And a 3 hour sidemen Sunday😵👏👏👏👏 I've died and gone to heaven
2:16:40 killed me 😂😂😂
Ksi might be the least coordinated most un athletic athlete ever
Dami dami
I bet the sidemen film stuff and is like 'yeah there's no way that's making the video' and feel so betrayed when it does
JJ's such a baby even Tobi actually tried skiing even though it was his first time
oh wow they made a movie… this is SICK🤩
1:07:46 Those guys are for sure some Norwegian rich guys that got a house down there next to Alfie Haaland
Ethan looks albino
This video was like an actual movie 😂😂❤❤
3 hours cmon
This is the hair style for JJ. Sat at the table for food. The loose braids and bandana is a solid look 👌
THREE HOUR VIDEO! Gonna be watching this for the next 6 nights hahahahahha  Yo, it's devastating seeing such limited snow there.  EDIT: It's Thursday and I'm only 1 hour and 37 mins into this vid... I watch about 20-30mins each day since upload lol. Extra views for you guys.  JJ on the zipline is CRAAAAAZY.
Why am I not surprised Harry said “sock” when asking that girl to trade
The old man wanted to beef Simon 1:05:00
Such a good edited video! I can only imagine the amount of footage the editors went through.
I love the way Freezy is , he’s the most honest and funny
Did any else notice Simon disappeared at one point with the ski instructor
Everything is Perfect in this Video! Especially the Editing!
more long vids like this!
Love holidays videos keep up the great work guys
3 hours of joy
Onlyfans, glorified cyber prostitution
Josh always puts banger holiday videos together
1:16:18 harry smelling a stanger woman sock....
The voting is all fun and games until it’s not. Relationships will be strained
Ngl 3 hours is just too long, literally need a day free to watch it
1:59:11 & 2:16:40 💀💀
Hands down the best video this channel has produced.
watching this at 12:36am, so ready to spend my whole night watching this 😎
Imagine how much this video in 4k take up storage… Maybe someone can calculate a ballpark? 😅
@sidemen 0:07
Harry sniffing the sock was hilarious. Just in frame
1:16:17 why did he smell it loool
I love how Josh gets more and more crafty with the teams
Old Cas video ref decision waiting music
Anyone else just go into complete sadness knowing they can’t have a lifestyle like the sidemen have. Love the videos, love the entertainment these guys provide.
swedish producer yeah, i see how it is, lets go victor bengtsson
Energy from the bad team was low and boring tbh
Casper is genuinely the goat 😂
this vid gonna last bare dinners
15:09 that transition into the ad was sooo clean
Ahhhh I wanna go to the good team skiing place so bad
This was literally a movie 🔥
This was one of my favourite Sidemen Sundays I've ever watched!!! I was laughing so much and the moods were so up and down. Caspar was hilarious.
josh knows teams that make the video good
Mr zerkaa does it again banger
I hope everyone KSI clowned in the beginning got paid cause that was just rude calling them all NPCs and laughing at them
What’s the name of that song at 2:13:00 ?? Was freaking perfect for that scene. Was like a magical moment in point break or something. I’ve heard a few times in some edits but never thought to look it up.
jj was so unbearable
no way 1:16:18 harry just sniffed the sock
Ayo Harry Simon viks onesie kinda sick. Anyone know where to get them!
Its a nice touch they did the credit at the end like a movie.. because this was a damn movie. shoutout to everyone behind the scenes!!
Such A Sick Video From Start To Finish 🔥🙌🏼 W Josh
300 hours is a MOVIEEEEE
‘i liked my own comment’,is not as cool as this comment 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
Big hand to the sidmen and their production team. This is truly great content.
credit to those who watched the whole 3 hours.
Best sidemen video in ages!
Simons such a downer bro
3 hours must be a British banger!
This is the funniest 3 hours of my life
Josh handling JJ like a toddler having a tantrum on the buss
This is one of the best sidemen videos!
Not Harry casually sniffing the woman’s sock 😂 1:16:19
Poor harry he even sniffed the sock 😂
Harry: give them a kiss goodnight go on Vik: blows a kiss Harry: that was a bit weird
Casper is such an eccentric 😂 had me rolling
Nah the production has come so far it’s actually insane. The amount of animation/editing in the first 5 minutes of the episode is phenomenal. Well done team.
just got done. Banger!
Let Casper join the sidemen
36:25 Snipers aiming at the boys 👀
Honestly Boys Great Video Hopefully one day ill be able to See the Magic Views Like this myself.Keep up the great work
Randy’s comedy debut 😂😂😂😂
3 hour sidemen sunday! holy smokes - I know what I'm doing later.
Goated video
1:16:19 why did harry sniff the sock 😭😭
I loved this. end credits were such a nice touch
I look forward to every last one of these videos every Sunday after work🙏🏻💯
2:16:40 im dyinggg 😭😭😭
This was a great holiday video much more fun than the summer one.
Fatneek is back
3 hour sidemen video? yall treating us well
FATNEEK IS BACK!
Now I can watch tlirlt through my lunch and dinner 😂
Bangerrr
Copyright music wtf
As soon as I saw the title and thumbnail I got excited to watch!
2:16:46 I was dead 😂😂😂
3 hours is crazy. What a video! 🤝🏻
BANGGEERRRR!!!!
surely that laugh at night with the boys is worth the bad team experience, awesome
This is longer than a Bollywood movie. I like.
Ksi was bare rude icl
If you pause at 39:56 Ethan is going NUTS.
boys cooked
Give me the bad holiday anyday  always looks like they have much more fun than being in most exspensive relaxing getting waited on no thanks holiday is to go have fun and make great memories can just stay home and relax
Stopped watching half way through definitely not watching Harry and JJ swap
Yoooo this was much needed I needed to stay up till 6am and 3hrs of this has got me past midnight, Josh and the whole crew involved in this a tip of the cap, best part the troops sleepover was vibes and the morning "sunrise" was sick
I'm like an hour in and I am not reading comments because of potential spoilers.... but how in the world did the man not know rock paper scissors?
Best sidemen vid ever hands down
i wonder if they paid for these songs
Stopping at day 1 then continuing Day 2 later. Gotta say the end was relaxing. ❣
ksi monkey bar clip caught me so off guard 😭😭
Next time the fans should vote for who’s on the bad and good team.
Production has been amazing, the edits to the advert, the overall music, getting Coldplay license? Having an end credit as well, Sidemen sunday are becoming movies and to be honest I am here for it, I got to the end and was hoping to see more, even after 3 hours of watching. Amazing work Josh and the boys, cant wait to see what more is coming!
43:30 "is he not full bear"  "i'm bullish" 😭
I genuinely think only the sidemen can drop a 3h vid and make an absolute banger. I paused it only once to get a drink!
QUALITY!!!
Masterpiece, the last 20 mins are goated and the vik joke at the end got me hahahahaha
3 hour sidemen sunday i must be dreaming
This is a masterpiece🔥
Why is this npc asking for a picture😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
3 hour sidemen Sunday turned basically into a film
1:16:19 Harry litterally sniffed the sock😂😂
the good teams place look so nice wth
there's some banger songs in this video! Honestly Loving it so far!
This was a movie for real . Banger
3hours… thank god I’m ill perfect for this😊
THREE HOUR SIDEMEN SUNDAY LETS GOOOOOOO!!!
The cinematography of these vids is absolutely amazing the  part at 1:26:51 is beating
Harry Smelling the sock 😭😭😭
All tobi does is complain and he gets the expensive team
I‘m still waiting for a good team vs. good team, but it isn’t spoiled by anything. Neither the teams know or the viewers by the looks of the vid at first
The last 5 is the funniest sidemen content i’ve ever seen😂😂😂😂😂
Nah no way 4 minutes in JJ is pressed about travelling with ‘normal people’ lmaoooo
who colour graded this then
Cheap team 2ne team defo got a hotel instead
I’m 95kg and can swing across bars one handed Ksi got no excuse for that
3 hours long and the only good parts are when they’re figuring out what teams they’re on smh
Ksi always on the good side
Man vik is always an NPC in this video but he’s just a class man when in the bad team ❤
Did Harry just smell the women's sock😂😂😂
The minute man said “group 2 alpine adventures” 😂
Absolutely amazing @zerkaa.. that was a great movie
I thought JJ said he was lactose intolerant in a previous video!
Is it just me or were there 100+ ads in this video
We need a petition for sidemen to stop with these type of videos now
The last few moments after the 3 troops arrived was absolutely hilarious! My favourite part honestly.
The fact that I can’t sit through a movie or tv show but I can watch a sideman 3 hour video 😂
1:09:09 this guy is such a good sport, i would carry vikkstar too, if i had the chance
3 hours... At this point just make it into series with episodes
38minutes harry does a ‘babe’ quote in the same accent I do it in, mega weird been saying it for years. ‘That’ll do pig. At’ll do’
2:16:50 POV Harry chasing ket😂😂😂😂😂
how was randys comedy the best bit ffs hahhahahah
Simon trying to cheer Vik up after no one picked him is so wholesome
has vik ever been on the good team? lmao
I was looking forward to the sidemen Sunday as I watched it every week but this one made me fall asleep
I got little bored .. 3 hr is just way too much.
Vik suggesting running over the other team made me die 53:02
Who tf has time for a 3hr sdm man Sunday
8:55 sad to see JJ react to a fan like that, just starts laughing in his face. We know hé is rich but laughing to guys that maybe for them is a realy Nice vacation is kinda low… I liked him so much but the last sidemen sundays he always wants to quit because he is in the bad team. Not much for a surprise who is the good team, he Will be  in it almost everytime
3 hrs? This is a banger
w ad
3hrs yessssss
what a movie
Casper is such a character 😂
One of my favorites by far! I would love if they did individual team cuts for all these holiday videos like with benadorm.
A 3 hour long Sidemen video!? Hell yea!! 😂
jj turned up his ‘entertainment’ levels for that coach ride.
peak
ksi try not to be insufferable challenge
nah what's the point of tobi in being in the good team, he literally dont provide any content, i mean it's Josh's video so obviously Tobi will be in the good team , love Tobi tho he seems like a really nice guy but he only provides good content when he's around Harry or Vik . Vik deserves some better friends btw , feel so bad for him
This was a banger
Wicked vid Josh 🔥
Sphere Ball!
Nah harry sniffing the womans sock 😭😭😭
Josh with another certified Hood Classic!!!
Don't Give af that guy tryna teach jj was hilarious get him in more vids man 😂❤
next time jj needs to be in the bad team is going to be so funny
holy im in heaven 3hr long sidemen video
In coming years I don't know where we will be, but we will love the sidemen always and forever. I stayed up till 5:45 AM to watch this and will always be proud loving the sidemen.
freezy is right, the end was so wholesome
why does Ethan look like smash mouth
Having credits at the end felt like it should have been there the whole time but we never realised it… a very nice touch of professionalism. This has been one of the best vids yet! *Plus the sound track in this film BANGS 🔥
lets go fatboy slim
The end titles we’re perfect! This felt exactly like a movie! I loved it every way! Especially the end! So wholesome and fun! Thanks Sidemen and Production 💪💪❤️
its just so random hearin jj simon and vik talking about overwatch
Can we get a crew planned holiday like they plan everything to the teams to the activities
Sidemen Show sledding vibes :)
A+ video guys ❤
8:54
Kon is not in camera team anymore?
It’s crazy how much they take it for granted, even the cheap team would be an amazing experience
Aww how nice is Vik letting the camera man not film such good soul xx
I love how tobi and ethan humble JJ on the bus 😂😂
so his name isnt Randolph....????
Can JJ not get the good team for once, kinda getting played out with the same bullshit over and over again
I'm waiting for the sidemen sleepover video 😂😂 that little bit at the end was great ❤️
This will easily be my favourite video this year.
Why are people wasting their time complaining about JJ. 1) he not reading comments and 2) he don't care what people think about him
its low-key unfair that swap y'all did, all because jj gloats?? he's not the only one who gloats when they're on the good team, and especially just cause harry moaned and groaned the whole night before lol tees away from the whole cheap team to make them swap just cause they complain
Honestly - the complaining is entertaining for the first 5 minutes, but then it just becomes annoying
JJ is in rare form here. The pain is real for Harry.
1:51:30 vik with the Rick and Morty reference😂😂
1:16:19 nahhh why did harry sniff the sock
How ever many likes this comment gets is however many push ups I’ll do
JUSTICE FOR VIK
Cashpur is actually goated 😂😂
Actually would love to be able to do snowboarding or skiing after watching this video
One of the best Sidemen Sundays I've ever seen. Big up the Sidemen.
It’s currently midnight… one more video won’t hurt haha
Let me guess, Vikk is in the bad team... 🙄🙄
5 mins in and im loving it
fuckn movie i swear solid vid boys killed it
Wholesome ending
jj is the spitting image of predator
1:26:08 Harry's genuine shock and horror has me dead
The pain of the cheap holiday isnt the experience its knowing what the others are doing
Nah they smashed this production once again...how have they done it again??
what a vid
The music adds so much great they can use it
Vikk has been a really good sport this vid
Props to Josh for joining and helping the cheap team
The PRODUCTION of this video is insane and I'm only 20 minutes in :)
Nahhhh I’m ngl these edits ARE COLD get it lmao😅😂
I would not dare to steal harrys cheese
Where is Konstantine ?
The last 5 minutes >> hole video
JJ, Tobi and Ethan out here manifesting  Tinky Winky, Lala and Po
What a video The editing was sick  The teams and guests were sick This video was actually like a movie 🔥  Sidemen cheap vs expensive videos never disappoint One of my favourite videos yet
nah 3hrs is crazy tho
Naa man that was mean of JJ and Ethan laughing at the guy just wanting to take a picture with them.
Met harry chip and gib today nice guys
Kasper needs to be in more videos, he's phenomenal and matches the weird energy 🤣

BANGER !!
1hour 25min still fun
good job playing copy righted music, now youre not gonna make money, 3 hour vid as well
3 hours here we go
Naaa Why’s Josh’s Hair So Gray😂🥺
Josh SMASHED this video. My god the laughs I had was insane, 3 hour long movie 10/10
The Nigerian boys made it out 😂
seeing jj ski was the best part of the video
My fav video so far I don’t know how they keep doing it but I love it! 🔥🔥🔥
Jj was unbearable to watch this vid, damn from the coach to the bad team skiing, he needs to stop complaining all the time and try to be a bit more like vikk
Felt like I was watching a movie ✨
For the fact harry concert his fear of bights he should be rewarded with an safe spot for the next tour in the good team wich leaves the opportunity to create a video of challenges hosted by harry for the last two spots in the good team 🔥🔥
production quality going 🔝
I hope we get a both cheap or both expensive holiday one time.
OMG, Imagine am a celebrity Get me out of here SIDEMEN Edition!!!!
what a lovely 3 hour video from the sidemen on a sunday by my favourite youtubers ever 😍
The drunk dude punching Simons hand had me😂😂
Ksi has become so unlikeable
Genuinely love these guys 🤣 always a good laugh and great time!
oh hell yeah.. 3 hours of watching! love it
This is worthy on being the most viewed video level of content
The end credits was kinda cool 😅
I watched all 3 hours and 58 seconds
3 whole freaking hours wtf!
James Frames video shots are looking incredible
ksi deserves the bad team always ngl
Lads I think this is another 100mil 🎉🎉🎉

Serious OG Europe holiday/Benidorm vibes from this video :)
Loved how Vik tried to help everyone when they were skiiing
Love this video! So many funny moments 😂
Vikk carried the vibes of the cheap team ❤
3 hour Sidemen Video, let’s go! Such a wholesome ending
Yeh you lot stepped it up with this one.
Cooked
josh needs to give the good team tasks to earn the house or he needs to give everyone tasks the worse people to do it gets bad house the best poeple tht does it well 3 of them gets the good house????
2:14:53 Harry looks like an "Italian Nonna" 😂
Please tell me someone else saw harry sniff that sock he got
The Cheap Teams outfits ngl ‘Go Hard’ 🔥
I loved ever second of this video. Even if the sidemen only put out 1 video a month. If it’s like this I’d love it
Nah I was DYINGGG ON 2:07:20-2:07:50
Wait this is 3 hours?! Guess I’m not doing my class work tomorrow then! Wooooop! LOCKED!
Honestly one best sidemen videos
Thats hilarious @2:16:40
everyone who has finished it lmk "JJ: do I just pee anywhere? Simon: there's a bathroom JJ:*VISIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT
3 hour long episode… LFG BABY!!
Ending was wholesome
The ending mate's. It's so good 😊, sure Banger
24:46  My dad just texted me 😂
Poor harry man😢😂
why is the pool at the nice house literally the same as the pool in the sidemen house lmao
JJ actually kinda annoying fr
I need Josher as my travel agent
I want a whole video of just casper
35k vs 4k
Definitely one of my new Favorite Sidemen videos, watched the *whole* thing. Good job to the team who help with this masterpiece❤👍
JJ is so funny 😭😭😭😭

“Zerka is doing a meet and greet!!” Top comedy lads 😂
Somebody eating a porkchop in Minecraft 😂😂 @31:25

Dope video! Wasn't expecting 3 hours but I enjoyed every minute 🔥
Got to feel for Vik

Is anyone here after KSI got RKO'd?
ksi is unbearable in this
This video is a treasure. Imma cherish it till the end of time
2:16:41 THIS CAMERA ANGLE GETS ME EVERYTIME 💀😭
⛔️Spoiler protection⛔️
Why did this feel like a better movie than most real movies even had the credits rolling at the end
This is one of the best vids yet. Love the relegation and promotion. Goated series of events and goated vid.
The 3 worst members of the Sidemen on the good team, how did Josh screw things up so badly?
What a banger of a video! The boys just constantly raise the bar 👏🏼
No Konstantin and immediately the content improved
Loved it
Idk if it’s just me but I feel like this is edited and recorded like more of a documentary and it’s nice
i can't imagine being on a tour bus and a guy starts screaming like that while being surrounded by camera
3 HOURS ??????
wow, what a video!!!!!
Josh cooked , one of the best in long time!
Nah they can’t do that. Josh is the best host 😂
The ending is just pure class i love it the music suits perfectly and lovely to see vikkstar back thats one of my favorites vik moments
1:17:37 😂😂😂😂😂
video was great, but a bit unnecessary parts were in it ngl, but love to see more 3h long vids in movie style. I think just the snow theme wasn't so great <3 love to see Kasper again
Vikk needs to be on the good team next time
the camera at 1:00:00 almost killed me
my ADHD never lets me watch a video without skipping. BUT i watched every minute <3 :o this was crazy!
What a soundtrack for today's vid, the ending song was perfect to...." It's been a long long road together, thru the hard times and the good, I gotta celebrate u baby, praise u like I should" Congrats to the Sidmen for many years of great success and to many more, just a few videos into the year n your killing it once again 🎉
3 HOURS ????? BOYS THIS IS ABOUT TO BE A FKIN MOVIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 😁
The bad team outfits were actually 🔥
Absolute Cinema
The editors went crazy on this one
The goats this content is sick
1:16:19 Harry sniffing the sock is wild
Bro’s looking at him like he’s a superhero 😂
Jj is soo boring, and josh gets called the boring one
Love the use of good copyrighted music.
JJ is me when I went skiing
5:30am and just completed watching this banger🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽
"I think jesus was american, lets be honest" 💀💀💀
This might be an unpopular opinion but I really just don't like JJ
2:58:27 omg I'm actually dying xdd. "He's probably had a heart attack". The way that was so funny bc it was late night and its a boys sleepover xd
The south park theme tune couldn’t have been better 🤣🤣
Everyone just looked past Harry sniffing the sock
Nah icl if I asked for a photo with kai and he laughed at me and called me an NPC I don't think I could ever leave my house again. That's actually so mean man
WOW best vid on the channel by far
They are all 23 at heart
JJ made the video. A banger!
1:10:35 Harry likes his cheese, he'll never forgive the one that steals it. 😂
is it just me or the red team are actual cvnts towards the other
love casper
1:04:42 "where can I put my cheese"😂 Harry is too jokes
2:16:39 Nightmare fuel
I’m only 35 min and I want the guys to do another vacation but both teams are bad
3 hours and only one team swap? Weak
what a banger of a video one of the best in my opinion
Casper is a GOATED guest
JJ doesn’t deserve to be on the good team… ever. F that guy
2:08:31 THAT'S OUR FATMAN
What a banger
this was an actual movie
"or it can also crash on the side of the mountain!" Man viks gotten crazy 🤣
“I got yagar in my veins call me yagarmcgregor”

The toast "To KSI's downfall" is hilarious 1:06:00
29:49  Why was this so hot🔥🤒
What a banging vid❤️ That cable bridge 🌁

big ups Vik always positive even tho he's rarely had the good team experience!
The fact you gave us a 3 hour vlog… THANK YOU 🎉❤

2:16:38 😂😂😂
Banger after banger after banger ‼️
2:13:00 crazy view on that bridge
So glad harry got the bad team hes so annoying haha
harry smelling the sock
When jj craps himself when they bang on the roof😂😭😭
JJs morbidly obese once again
Please boycott McDonald's!!
So JJ is annoying when he's on the good team and boring on the bad team. Tough choice.
I love when the 3 Nigerians are on a team 🙌😂
3 hours?!?!? LEGENDS
Petition to have Vik sent to the good team by himself for once and all the others on the bad one 😂
2:16:43 might be one of the funniest camera shots the sidemen have ever produced.
Toby look like MXP 😅 the movie
we should do a group bad team vs group good team
Okay 3hr among us video next🤌
40:27 What was that Catch from JJ
Harry's right... the music makes the video better
I vote verjayjay and casper have to spend the day together
I could not hear another yelling ksi it’s torment I get physically ill big up red team
Vikk is optimistic, i love it! 🥰 😊
Is it me or ksi low key chubby.. no hard feelings
Finally one that isn't just one night
VIK: “This is terrible we are mocking poor innocent people …”  *transitions to rich team’s dinner*
So looks like my evening is sorted out 😅
Guys, 3 hours ? Isn’t it long ?
1:15:42 Harry "is that a joint ,i cant have that"😂😂😂😂 too funny
What part  In Denmark is this?
Josh has them traumatized LOL
Man I just realized this is a 3hr vid HAHAHAHA
Nahhh casper is such a vibe😂😂😂
Loved this video guys... I feel like it was the perfect Sunday evening watch and the boys at the end was just amazing #SideGang4Life
vik is so wholesome man i lovee him!!!!
the sidemen have made a movie im willing to watch
The only people who can make me watch a 3h video nonstop!!
1:16:17 He smelt the sock 💀💀
Harry smelling the sock 💀💀
08:06😂😂😂those vikks words came as a shock to me 😂😂😂
Moral of the story : its not the money which makes the trip valuable but the people around us
Everyone saying vik handles the bad team best…   Vik: wishes Josh dead in a song and plans a skiing crash against the other team 😂
The ending for the bad team was actually so wholesome.
is no one talking about how harry smelt the sock 1:16:20
JJ getting fat again
3:00:58 my jaw is aching🤣
3 hr video 😳😳🔥
3 hour ep... yo fair play to editors 👌🏼😭
1:16:19 Harry smelling the sock😂😂😂
2:16:40 That is absolutely horrendous LOOOL
The Side+ ad was so clean
tf 3 hours :)
Only absolute goats would put out a 3hr video that isn't a VOD
2:16:39 thought it was freezy
LEGENDARY. I will show my grandkids 😂
3 HOURS IS CRAZYY!!!! W VID
The bad team might have a terrible time but the memories that they give fans is priceless. Something the good team can’t get
Loved this so much, can’t wait for more
We better get a bad team with just Josh and tobi lol
Surprised Harry didn’t pull off the ‘drowning man in a wheelchair’ whilst synchronised swimming😂
15:00
shoutout Rhea from les elfes. The ones that get it get it
Harry sniffing the sock after trading away the cheese is crazy
41:02 The Zerka Song everyone
How do these just keep getting better
Tbh be getting annoying, he is so spoiled
JJ looks like he’s using the ooowoo 👉👈 technique while skiing 2:12:06
1:00:50 Titans in AOT be like
JJ’s constant moaning is so annoying man
Last scene was good
jj needs to be humbled, always acting like a stuck up brat
Can’t remember the last time JJ was on the bad team
Cashpur for the 8th sidemen member 😂
This video cooked. Best one ever
vik proving he is in fact vikkstar123 by doing his intro is hilarious
1:18:36 i cant this video way too funny i am laughing so hard
So we get repeated sundays and side+ has different videos every Saturday
This is going to be a very long dinner 🤣
so many ads sidemen going broke?
Bro w intro
jj deserves to be on every bad team
How is copyrighted music being used genuine question like jerk it out and coldplay
the fact this video went up 500,000 views by the time i finished it explains a lot
next time u need a ski camera man i got yall <3 condolences for my camera mans on the bad team
JJ sounds so ungrateful on the slay
Anyone else start laughing when Harry smelled the sock? lol.. Only he would do that.
intro went hard
naaaaa JJ at 35:08 lol mans is sus. looking like shay shay lol
3 hour sidemen so good 😅😊
If u watch all of this. Touch grass
What was the logo on the pool table?
Chasper was jokes, the praying for JJ’s downfall and the blue team after switch up😭👏👏👏
Why vik, harry n minimeter outfits look like they from rainbow 😂😂
Omg 3hr long... I am locking in boys
14:20 ok.
Bad team instructor was like sacha baron cohen lol
2:16:49 this is my sleep paralasys demon
Nahhhh this video’s crazy. The licensed music, the side+ ad, and obviously the video itself.  Outdone yourself again boys 👏👏
What on earth. 3 hours, okay I’m in love
0:45 is no one gonna talk about this cool transition, gives me Johnny English vibes
This is a movie!
3:00:54 wild frame
i was wondering how they used copyrighted music in this, anybody know?
The DIVE at 2:46:00 is just... 👌
What a video i think this might be the best sidmen video of all time
Can someone explain why JJ kept saying micro aggressions? 😂
Nah jj was wrong for being disrespectful to the people on the coach calling them npcs just cuz they don't have money like him out of order tbh needs to learn some manners and be polite
All videos this year was sick, keep it up boysss
a work of art
Felt like 3 minutes 😂😂
2:16:41 Harry running across the bridge is an actual comedy masterpiece!
Calling people NPCs is the most annoying internet phrase out there
Never knew Sidemen started making movies as well. ❤
3 HRS!!!????
2:15:32  Cashpur & Vicky 😂😊❤❤❤
JJ ON THE ZIPLINE XD
Am I seeing this right? 3hrs long I’m ready
I’d of thought JJ might be good at monkey bars 😏  😂😂🤝 sorry jid
35:49 ouk
Been dying for longer videos and then this drops, yesssss ❤
The comments complain about JJ complaining😂 that's the content ya dips Take a rich famous guy and make em do funny stuff he doesn't want to do Understand yet sheeple?
Best sidemen Sunday so far without a doubt
3 HOURS!!!!
JJ calling some normal people on the bus, that are going skiing - NPCs kinda made me sick. Not a cool move...
First half really good
Harry running at 2:16:00 had me dying 😂
Why did Harry smell the sock🤨
1:30:30 I was praying jj would get the bad team alone 🤣
Nice all sidemen
JJ and Tobi are on the good team every time...
JJ eating all that cheese like he is not lactose. He def forgot he lactose intolerant with that "Rich" team 😂
Would be so funny if the use of the song 2 hours in has caused them to make 0 money off the whole 3 hour video
editor cooked
02:04:24 song title please
1:16:18 harry sniffing her sock 😂
A 3 Hour VIDEO ITS 00:43 IN THE MORNING I HAVE SCHOOL
Loved the longer videos 💙💙
I’m tryna figure out if the people on the bus knew they’d be there before
1:34:20 ahahhahahaha jj jj
2:16:45
This was genuinely the best piece of cinema ive witnessed all year
If JJ pissed in the stream Cal drank from that is jokes😂
banger
If Vik doesn't get his own private holiday in the next episode I'm gonna boycott the sidemen 😂 25:35
the vibes at every boys sleepover before going to bed are despicable
This ones a hall of famer
This was such a wholesome video. I felt bad for Vik, he would've really enjoyed skiing down that path.
Not gonna lie, the cheap team always seems hella fun
Nobody is going to tall about Harry smelling the sock 😂 1:16:19
The skiing bit with Kashper was so funny.
2:14:22 there is always that one friend that would shake tf out of that
The production here is so crazy
sidemen cooked this week
How did that get the amazing music I thought it was copyrighted
as usual, cheap team way better
1:16:35 simon tried to say rock paper scissors, but it came out so wrong
1:39:30 that edit is actually sick
sleepover outro killed me lmao
love the length
1:37:31 Vik: " I just wanted a vote" 😭😭😭
love the animations and the plane animation in the beginning
classs
I think this is the first vid where the cheap team is really boring😂
ive just knew casper was going to be said
JJ spitting everywhere when zip lining was too funny 😂
I’m ngl the cheap team looks like a holiday I would kill to go on😂
W
The colors of this video 🙏🏻❤️❤️
What happened to Simon... he disappeared when casper arrived
cal rigwog has always been so funny
Ngl the bad holiday is still a dream holiday for me.
This gonna be a good night 👍
This would be insane with all the sidemen on that mountain top
This is such a good video we'll done josh 🎉
KSI is such a baby
actually josh and crew killed it with production, for sure one of the best sidemen sundays quality wise👍
amazing vid and content
Tbh Vikk deserves to be on a good team
the first 10 minutes and i am laughing uncontrollably
Tobi getting niced every video, but humble as always.
this is a literal movie
Calfreezys choke hold was funny af 😂😭
The angle of the camera when Harry was running across that bridge killed me 😂😂😂
I think Vikk needs to plan one of these
the last few minutes of the boys trying to go to sleep is actually soooo funny lmaoo
We need more Calfreezy bro, was crying tears with everything he did
idk how Josh manages to add twists to the challenges, I liked the one at the beginning lol
3 hour video?😭
Everything about this video is gold. The moments the boys had. 3 hours?? Props to Josh the GOAT. 🙌🏼 Along with the team and editors. Thank y’all for your hard work. 🙌🏼❤️  Also I knew it was Cashper right away. 😂
Josh is cooking
Coldest Sidemen opening ever🔥
this is gonna be a long dinner
not 200 dollars though is it
Has the sidemen got a music license now?
2:16:40 🤣🤣🤣
I loved this. 😍😍
1:16:20 Harry sniffing the sock is CRAZY
The "no airr" comment by JJ took me out 🤣🤣 when Ethan did a stinkbomb in the ski lift
bro vik deserves better, the fact he got no votes to go to good team even though he is the heart of the sidemen 😔😔
2:12:40 Harry's Reaction was amazing and after that the cut into JJ
1:26:02 who snored like that😂😂
This video was sick, The humor, The length, The atmosphere. It was crazy.
01:23:12 💀💀💀💀💀💀
Ethans philosophical observations are jarring, otherwise great vid!!
Coming home from drinking with a kebab and watching sidemen is prime life
Jj being a professional boxer and not being able to do the monkey bars💀
For me cheap team is how I have my time im loveing it
I wish they would introduce Cashper to Phil 😂
SIMON MINTER HES BOTTLED THE TOP 🗣️🗣️‼️‼️‼️👋🏽👋🏽👋🏽
So nice to see JJ with some meat on his bones again that isn’t pure steroids 😂 I jk but it is nice to see him living his best life again without all the restrictions from training! Hope VIK is feeling better ❤ great video boys!
2:16:51 omg 🤣🤣🤣 funniest angle ever !!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That ending was rough lmfao. Great stand up routine Randy!
Here the once’s who knew this was coming base on the last video bc zerkaa said he has to be back by Monday
The sleepover in the end is the funniest
THREE WHOLE HOURS
1:16:19 👀👀 Harry 🤨
Sleepover conversation was jokes 😂
Absolutely love Vik, he deserves better. He kept it together for as long as he could
2:16:35 the sudden cut killed me 😂😂😂
Right now 49 minutes zerka should be sued for reckless endangerment. Lol.
2:12:46 got literal goosebumps at paradise scene
We finally got the sideman movie
yous r not alright
Nice watching a youtube video with proper music in it
so funny 1:24:49 ah that was a bit weird 😂
dunno if i can be arsed watching a 3hr video and i’m only 24 secs into the video 🤣
How is ksi soo fat again
This was brilliant
40:25 the no look catch cold
The consistency of the production throughout this video is so insane. Well above YouTube standards boys, good job ❤
Gotta love a 3 hour sidemen video 😅
Where did the side men go on this holiday?
Right here right now 😮‍💨😮‍💨
Incredible video, keep it up boys
This is the best sidemen Sunday what a movie loved casper and the ending was literally the end to a great movie big well done also big shout of to all the bts camera, drone operators and editors and everyone else who took part in this video loved the use of music as well gonna rematch this one when I'm bored 100% ❤
I think that if one of the guys on the bad team is hosting the next video like this one, Josh is going to waterski......behind a submarine.......underneath the arctic ice.
A 3 hour vid is acc taking the piss I’m watching this at 11:30 and I got school tmrw 😂😂
Them cheering to ksi’s downfall is crazy
Where was Tobi during the travelling? Didn’t see him once
42:02 jj acting like he dosent eat things like this everyday
damn, a 3hour sideman video? its going to be a lit video.❤
I have to say this was an amazing video. Feel like I’ve been through the trenches with the cheap time. Loved every minute. Well done ❤❤
Nahhhhh that intro 🔥🔥🔥
Couldn't watch as soon as the bad team started the slopes with the guy from a previous video. Ruined the whole thing for me he was so cringe didn't fit the vibe of the video at all.
Was that a hotel being built on top of the peak of the mountain?
I like the thought that as I’m watching this 3 hours after release, people who watched the second it popped up are only just finishing watching it.
I always find it funny how the ‘bad team’ just has an average family holiday and act like it’s the slums😂
2:16:40 That angle is jokes 😂😂😂
LOVEED THE CREDITS, BIG UP THE EDITORS <3
WHAT A BANGER!!!!!
3 hours this is very good we need more 3 hour videos
“Go go power rangers” after farting is crazy
a great 3 hrs
Great video! Wholesome ending aswell! One of my favourites for sure
nahhhh guys tbh nobody finishing 3hr long video at once...people gonna get bored tf is this?
Honestly the editing the small like BT’s bits the credits n ending was amazing Boys honestly amazing
Harry definitely wanted vik to shut the hell up when he was on abt crashing into them with skis 😂😂
Ethan actually has a dad bod
3HOURS!!!🎉🎉🎉
This is better than a movie, should do more like this
Don’t get me wrong love the video but the whole point of the video is to have the bad team stay in the place yet they are literally saying yeah jj is leaving and stuff life defeats the point
i was not ready for a 3 hour SMS but im all for it
Where??
These would be better if JJ didn’t complain over everything because he’s rich. We get it bruh, just be a normal human for once
3 fuckin hours
1:25:52 so uncalled for 💀
W Video boys
Nobody: 40:27 Ethan: come on boy😭😭
Watching Sidemen is always a big W. This guys makes my Monday.
NGL i struggle watching 2+ hour vids but this was lite
Just finished it, banger of a video! props to the editors that worked hard to get this out today.
These editors need a pay rise and Josh vids are GOATed
Haven’t laughed so much as I did I when they was bout to go sleep at the end 💀
Sad to see Josh pushing for the boys to drink just for content.
I swear the Benidorm trio (Simon, Vik, and Ethan) make the most out of being the bad team on these ❤❤but harry tried keep the vibes up. I love harry. Love Josh too. I respect that he puts himself on the bad team
Bro that “cheap” team is like the ultimate lads holiday lmao.
To see how ungrateful KSI was is shocking needs to put himself in them guys position and see what it's like to effectively get called poor and npc's stay humble
I can’t lie jj is the funniest guy ever
What’s wrong with the cabin on the moutain? They have alcohol and board games. It’s the perfect boys night. Would love to be in that cabin
.
40:08 olive oil and balsamic vinegar is rich 😂😂😂
@1:29:07 Why’s my nickname gotta be Shitell 😭😭
Vik the goat
I laughed a lot ngl😂❤
2:57:00 onwards is the reason these videos bang the so called ‘bad’ team 😂
a 3 hour movieeeeeee, matee talk about a 6 course meal
Harry smelling that sock got me dying XDDD
Lol
had to wait all day but we get 3 hours in return
30 mins in and havin a blast
Three hours with copyrighted music, they’ve made it
Caschper was a very fine addition to the bad team
This has to be top 3 of my favourite sidemen videos of all time
here is to more sidemen sundeyes like this one!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:16:18 harry sniffs the sock
21:36 this is best bit
Simon REALLY started showing his Karen side at the end there. Good lord xD
bro jj just hurts my head 33:42
Vik acts more and more middle class really makes it hard to watch
Broo fair play!!!! It's an actuall movie and the ending is amazing 👏  Well done on this masterclass. Definitely the best Sidemen Sunday ever. ❤
Give each team 100k to find best location, activities, ect. Then get the host to go on both holidays and judge the best, each team sets challenges for the other team
what a banger of a intro tune
The ending though! Such a good feeling!
After watching this JJ should be on the bad team indefinetly so he can moan for a reason
need a bts of the sleepover with cal, cal, and randy
17:19 so fkn wholesome 😂
Why did harry smell the sock 😂
It’s so lovely how Harry‘s spirit lifted as soon as Josh joined them
35:10 JJ pulling Tobi back to sit next to him cuz he didn’t feel included is low key wholesome 😂
Is it just me who actually felt bad for the cheap team on the first night?
Unbelievable boys fantastic video again onto the bts to get another 3 hours 😂😂
I NEED more Casper 🤣🫶🏾
3 hours of pure entertainment. Soo many epic moments.
Unreal video.
The ending is honestly so nice and wholesome the boys are just in bed, cracking jokes and laughing. Memories that they'll remember and cherish
Now should I watch this on my own or with Freya? 😂
VJJ is wild😂😂😂
Vikk’s fit is lowkey nice for being on the cheap team…
Why did Harry smell the sock😭😭
Bro this vid was so good i got chills at the end. This is better then most movies i have seen.
aint that jhanma at the start of the vid. the one with the spacesika fit
Can y’all stop having freezy in the videos  Mans annoying as hell
What a video
A winter holiday in spring 🤣
1:16:19 HARRY! don't sniff the sock!
holy crap. 3 hours.
1:16:20 not harry sniffing the sock😂
how they using songs and not getting copyfright?
These travelling videos are the best.
Zerka always seems to plan the biggest bangers
WATCHING AFTER BREAKING FAST
mid
I love Dan (Cashpur) calling them Vicky and Vajayjay 😂
I feel like this should have been on Netflix
The way they all ready to get back at jj😂😂😂
They have actually become so un relatable as someone who has traveled on a budget including Skiing the bad team accommodation and area would still be very expensive and I’m struggling to see what they are complaining about half the time. JJ’s reaction to literally just being on a bus with normal people was weird as-well.
Feel bad for vik he ain’t been on the good team in forever
WE LOVEE LONG VIDEOS
This video was insane! And the music mede it so much better! 10/10
3 hours of pure gold
I asume some audio was lost on this trip... there are gaps of it missing everywhere.😅
How was vik not voted to go on the good team I will never know the guy has the worst record
Jj being a woo girl... real.. the cinematics..  real... best sidemen video till date
Anyone else feel for steve having to go to the bad team as well 😂
The bridge scene with Coldplay playing in the background was so cool!
Was fun to watch but wasnt as entertaining. JJ was ruining the vid, Tobi wasn’t even in the vid, W simon and vik they made the video fun to watch. BTW I don’t like how sideman is treating vik hes never in the thumbnail. What they need to change is that the videos need to be simpler
I dont have enough food to last 3hr
Oh my.. 3 hr vid!?!? Im sooo ready🤩
Harrys so cute its unreal
3hr sidemen Sunday, what a treat
I have never seen JJ look so flabbered and gasted
JJ Ethan and tobi are halarious together
Simon and Harry’s and Vic’s outfits are 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:26:10 Snoring 😭
3 hour sidemen Sunday… completed it mate
The fact jj always gets the good team kinda takes the mystery out of it ngl
Ngl i wouldnt be mad at either holiday, just the fact that the good teams experience is mental!!
1:18:26 😂😂😂
i can't help but feel bad for those people on the bus it's just so wrong for JJ to react like that
a 3 hour long video? how many people even have tiime for this?
Randy killed me😂
Why do I always feel like Toby feels left out 😢
2:21:01 I have an idea where Josh is not part of the teams if I can share it
Loving the new edits and songs SIDEMEN Sundays started looking like movies
BLESS VIK <3
This was a big banger for those who have yet to watch it
3 hours u know this finna hit
poor vik😂
Josh the OG is back with another banger
Do a £20,000 vs £200 sleepover
Gonna need to book the day off work to watch this. Gonna be worth it tho 😂
The end with the bad team was the best part 😊
Absolute banger holiday video.
JJs forehead cam goes nuts
2:38:56 vikk is such a tool
This is incredible, well done to everyone 🎉🎉involved
One of the best sidemen videos! To have videos like this I’d prefer a sidemen Sunday every 2 weeks
this was a freaking movie!!!
GOATED VIDEO
That’s it Vikki!
i need to see the bts of that sleepover with jj, simon, vik, lux, freezy and randy 😭😭😭😭
Incredible as always, the team that has Harry ends up being cooler and funnier ❤😂
2:16:39 POV: Abnormal Titan
2:12:48 the view+song is perfect 😍 make me wanna bust a nut 😩.
Bro lip bited for a lettuce
The way JJ was being disrespectful to the guy on the bus was pretty weird...
Give vik a good europe holiday
Elite
All this copyrighted music damnnnnn, sidemen new level
Why is harrys outfit kinda lit!!!! and he looks fit as
Kashper gives me Bruno vibes 🤣
Vik always gets put on the bad team because they know he handles it the best
I don't know if it's because I've not taken notice before, but is that the first time they used commercial songs in their vid??
No way harry sniffed the sock
I love how we are cutting back and forth between a pool dance with the boys on holiday, and a robbery in deep mountains at night.
Waiting for the sidemen sunday plot twist when they do a holiday where theyre both on bad team unknowingly or both on good team unknowingly
Felt like a movie, amazing video as always!
18:14 Put yo pinky rings up to the mooon 🗣️🗣️
and someone thinks among us is better than this? get a life
Im gonna call it now, that will be the best video they do all year That video cooked !! ❤
Slight editing thing. Not sure if that’s meant to be 43:21 shows a fly over of morzine when the other team are talking.
Uploaded 3 hours ago people who watched it as soon as it was uploaded have just finished wow
Best one yet, great edit and song choices on point 👍🏻
Spoiler blocker🚫
3 Hours! This gonna be good
vikk is class act always, goated person & sidemen fs
3 HOURS 🫢🫢🫢🫢🫢
When are they going to Japan and drift cars
Do Con not work for them any more did see his name
the way JJ acted on the coach just isn’t on srsly🙄
Just finished it, the ending was brilliant
1:16:20 not him sneaking in a whiff of the sock 😭
Last bit had me smiling so much
Harry and his dad sharing the interest in plane crashes is weirdly wholesome
Me thinking the day was bad and the sidemen drop a 3h film/video 😄
Great production Josh! and everyone! My belly hurts from laughing too much now.
Best sidemen sunday ever W
Kinda L vid ngl
“In still shooting”😂
The Ende had me dying… the jokes and the laugh when they went to sleep 😂
Absolutely banger of a vid🔥
bless this video for being 3 hours this is what i needed bro.
Vik got violated with the pink ski suit
In the “love room” in the good teams chalet. There is video evidence of people “getting down” all over twitter 😂
Entertaining throughout! Plus, the editing and the visual shots in this video is unreal🔥
nah man vik deserves to be in the good team. man was literally puking violently two days before this shoot. the boys always do him dirty
AMAZING 3 HOURS !!
Simon realising Harry said the words good team,148 upload am really, zerka paragraphing like a gf,Ethan pose better
Nah jj laughing at other people that just want a nice trip at 12:30 is crazy he’s changed as he has got rich
What a track to open the intro with ooft  Edit: what a track to outro with aswell, what a video in general, unreal
That intro was fire
that was sick!!!! big up Josh❤
1:04:28 legit one of the funniest simon jokes
3 hours and two pee breaks later and that was amazing
amazing video, 3 hours of pure entertainment. Loved the good ending with callux and them surprising the bad team, also Ethan and Harry doin that water choreo was proper funny.
3 hour sidemen vid im here for it!!!
ksi just being rude to his fans just being an upright idiot
3 hours of content is actually insane...
James got in trouble?
JJ and Behz on that swing was such a Tb to that hide and seek 😂
ngl  the music  choices really helped push this video to anther level entirely
Good vid but it’s really bad they were peer pressuring Harry to drink for the sake of content
This video is fkn amazing, for clips and content. big up
Editing on this one was supreme my god
This video was a certified banger ❤
The moon boots remind me of the twieenes 😂😂😂😂
Feels like casper is a german phil and hes hilarious
Man real love for the boys on the bad team doing there tasks. It's the best vibe.
ksi is actually so annoying just ruining everything for everyone and calling the peoples trips that they saved up for bad and just being disrespectful
The ending with the troops was so jokes, the comedy show and the chit chat in the dark was legendary man, I really felt it when calfreezy said his heart rate is through the roof, just a huge throwback to childhood sleepovers with your mates. Amazing video can't believe I actually sat through the whole thing
Wtf happened on 2:19:04 it jumped scared the hell out of me.
W VIDEO  JUST FINISHED IT end scene is sick!
Such a great video, hats off to Zerkaa and the team.👌
When did Freezy get on the bridge??
1:16:19 harry smelling the sock send me 💀
Was so funny 25:18
Tired of seeing JJ on the good team but happy to see Ethan on the good
KSI looks like such a d*ck on the bus
he really sniffed the sock
i  live for these feature length vids :)
47:26 Simon goes crazy and insults Josh to the Nth degree and re-reads the rules...  “Oh, zerkaa, sorry about that” 😂
This was actually the best sidemen Sunday I’ve ever watched! So funny
Omg 3 hour movie 🍿
3hr’s already at a million views, on a 3 hour Sidemen Sunday. I am SEATED!!!
3 hours? come on man this is ridiculous
i feel so bad for Vik man😭
Vacation videos always a banger
Can’t lie starting to dislike jj more and more
caspers my goat
😂the npc bit
Caspar the legend
JJ should be on the bad team until he stops moaning. He is so out of touch, mocking the trip on the coach and telling people they are NPCs is not funny even if its for bants, that was the "worst" part of the video, I enjoyed the rest and huge props to everyone that tried and the whole Sidemen team that worked on this BTS, I can only imagine how long it took to coordinate all of these clips and put them into 1 single video that lasts 3 hours. Not to mention Kasphur aka Dan was elite 😂 ... would love to see him again if there is a ski kind of trip.
3hr vid and banged go on lads keep it up
Bro red team's house edit was crazy
JJ is very unlikelable!
Casper was amazing!
my fav video so far! was literally saying to my pals today, I want them to come out with a holiday video and here we are! smashed it lads ❤
Wholesome ending
Jj was very annoying this video
3 HOURS LETS GOOOOOO
JJ isn’t good viewing just moaning and gloating all the time like he’s not living a life we all dream of. He needs some perspective and personality he’s just an arse these days!!
1:16:19 why did harry sniff the sock😂
I love the licensed music, it adds so much to the video imo
Why did harry sniff the sock 😂😂
the production on this is so impressive
harry sniffing the sock lmao
Jheeez 3 hours this is going to be a movie 🎥 🙌
KSI needs to be in the bad team, the videos are so much better.
are these boys being forced to make content? That last bit with the bad team was sad to witness
46:02 hahahahahahaha what a sequence of events
Best video they have ever made sat and watched it for 3 hours amazing do more like this
ngl jj is usually funny when he complains, but i think he took this bit a bit too far
8min in, and I just realized this is 3 hours long ;O YEEES
1:59:10 that's the funniest clip of the video... had me creasing
Finished in one. GG guys.
JJ's new fear unlocked,Skiing
Harry smelling the sock had me rolling 🤣
1:14:48 your new wallpaper
Why did they keep blurring out the logo on the pool table?
Josh W for getting JJ on that bus pf NPCs 😂😂
Cant think of a better way to spend 1/8th of my day 🤩
2:22:10 Josh knew what he done smart guy 😉
Vikk deserves a good team man
This is the worst time for this video for me. It's crunch time in the term and I'm dreaming of being in holiday now🙃
Mate started this vid at 10pm and I’ve only watched half I have school tomorrow and I’m staying up to 1 am watching the sidemen
Bring GKbarry on for 20 v 1!!
10:42 the guy siting behind Toby
The goodteam looking like the teletubies😂😂❤
Well my next 3 hours is sorted
Are they making money from this video, with these amazing songs😂👀
Casper the new Phil?
This is easy top 10 sidemen Sunday. Full of content, ups and downs. Masterclass from Josh Zerkaa. Well done boys
I just feel sad for vik bro
Lost it at Harry on the bridge 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Harry getting a text about air crash investigation is the most Harry thing ever 😂
Harry sniffing that sock at 1:16:18 ffs haha
Harry smelling the sock😭😭😭😭
me: sad cos i got school tomorrow .  sidemen: we gotchu bro
this did feel like a movie
1:08:00 this brings back some memories. sidemen house hide n seek bro
Harry ready to give up this Sunday 😂😂😂😂😂
Editors cooked with this video
3 hours 😮
Omg the ending!! Loved it
“ITS GIVING” 😂
Man said water was an atom... Man has "Knowledge" tattooed across his chest... Man has more money than I'll ever see in this lifetime... FML... JJ has become too rich for his own good. Man used to be relatable, now he's just really hateable. Screaming like a brat on the bus and calling the other passengers NPCs was another L. They probably can't afford "KSI Standard" holidays and they're probably really looking forward to that trip and he's there just sh*tting on it cause he's "too rich" for that. I can't even watch his videos anymore. KSI was the reason I got onto the Sidemen. I really enjoyed his videos before he got Prime and it wasn't even his doing, Logan gave him a free ride and now he's such a massive c*nt. That massive forehead of his is microscopic compared to what a massive d*ck he's become. He's only decent around the other Sidemen. With anyone else, he's an L.
A 3 HR SIDEMEN VIDEO THIS IS  ALREADY SCREAMING FOR A REAL BANNGER
A JOSH SIDEMEN SUNDAY NEVER LETS US DOWN
JJ gave me the ick like 5 times this video LOL🤣
something about JJs misery just makes me smile
L joke Randy,
Best Sidemen intro of all time
3 hours ffs I came to late tonight
Best 3 hours of my life, goddamn it was good
Okay sooo anyone else think the longer videos are the future of the side men cause I LOVED THIS
Nobody else catch harry sniffing the sock ?
JJ with the im to rich for this! lmfao
Ngl I prefer to see KSI outraged
JJ with a yellow or red card for missing the start of the video perhaps???
18:11 Why did I fall in love with this transition?!? (and also the camera panning is brilliant in these shots)
I feel bad for Vikk
Not Harry smelling the sock
Who else wishes they could cozy up with hot cocoa and watch this all day?😅☕️
spa was so good they began to speak another language 💀
Is it just me who thought simon was getting sniped but realised it was a light
1:16:43 Vikk always gets wrecked by strangers 😂
Felt bad for Vik he never had a good team
Is hilarious when JJ is so confused
round of applause for freddie miller-scott for editing this masterpiece, give that man a raise and a good nights sleep 🩷
Viks the goat poor guy deserves the good team out of everyone
1:04:56 that guy was wiiiinding up for Simon
Ethan and Tobi acting as NPCs to annoy JJ was Hilarious.
W video
3 hours?????
Vik and simon being a good sport the entire video  Also tobi was absent for like 80% of the video man whats he doing
👏👏👏
Now it's a party, had me rolling in laughter 😂😂
Should definitely make more like this because this was amazing
This was so sick 🤣
Watching this video gave me an idea. Love these videos but I think a cool concept would be to give each team a list of challenges like we already do, but with greater benefits, or dire consequences. So for example, the bad team. If they complete one of their challenges they get an upgrade to their holiday. Hotel upgrade, food upgrade, maybe a greater budget to go shopping. Just someway for them to work on making the holiday better. And for the bad team, for every challenge they don't complete they have something taken away. If they don't complete a challenge they get their hotel or dinner experience downgraded. Could even have them lose it to the bad team if they compete on a certain challenges to see who can finish it first. Just a thought I had is all, keep up the good work lads
@Zerkaa has done it again
Fantastic video what a banger love love loved it 💯🎆🎆🎆
Just finished the video at 2:08 ... totally worth it ♥️♥️
Food:✅ Drinks:✅ 3hrs Sidemen Sunday: ohh boy here we go 🙏🏽
3hours 🙌🤘
3 hour sidemen Sunday we EATING. I want MORE
3 hours of Sidemen Sunday? What a beautiful day to be alive as a Sidemen fan 😭🫶
If rate it so much if the thumbnail didn’t match the video. Before watching I know who’s good and who’s bad. Should just be random so it makes the video a surprise
What a legend Casper is, he carried the second part. Need more of him!
Come onnnnnbbbbbbnnnnnnnn
3:00:51  so wholesome
Did anybody else sniff at 25:05 or what?????
I think JJ just learned what a micro aggression is 😂
Josh is just so fuckin good at planing videos props to him🙌
the hut is a concept
When its frozen or uu not frozen
This one is a banger give it an oscar for real
I'm Swiss and this dinner is a normal mid dinner for us in Switzerland. Pls somebody show this comment to JJ. ahahah
Has Josh ever put Tobi on a bad team??
3 hours and the best part is legit the black screen 3 minutes from the end
People who had to spend an all nighter watching this vvvv
I live in Geneva- it’s always a pain to miss these lots when they’re around 🥲
How have they gone on a winter holiday is MARCH
Can we get a just good team more sidemen video
the fat ksi edit is so good ha
no wonder we can never see his gf, man's eaten her after the boxing
Please put Harry, Ethan and JJ on the cheapest/bad team because they are the sorest winners!
the ending had no right being that good tbf, smashed it 100%
3 whole hours is mad
3h oh yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
Never thought I’d see the day Harry has to be CONVINCED to drink😂
Bro, whenever Josh Harry and Ethan are together it's pure gold man 😂❤
May be the longest video, but didn't seem like it, I didn't want it to end. Top 3 videos of all time for me easily!!
That side plus advert was sleek af 👏👏
14:20 😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂
KSI spawn point: Geneva

Idk why they are saying the had horrific outfits. Simon and harry and Vik all have dope outfits. I like them more than the good teams 😂😂
I felt like I was watching a movie. Amazing job guys.❤😊☺️
Respect to editor chip for rditing this and making it 3 hours
Vikk is so energetic 😂
Video of the year.
The moment I see JJ on the good team I turn the video off, I cba man
Man this is crazy ngl  The ending aswell 🔥❤️❤️🤍🤍
that ending sleep was the funniest part for me the video😭😭
This will be named the greatest Sidemen video of all times in my books, congrats guys on another banger.❤🎉❤
Ahhh well it looks like ima have a 3 hour dinner
This…      This cooked. 🔥
Once Tobi and KSI are in a TEAM together, YK ITS BLESSED 😂😂😂
I hope JJ doesn’t leave the sidemen. Him and them have such a good dynamic
I KNOW KSI IS A MILLIONAIRE BUT WHY IS HE ALWAYS COMPLAINING 😭😭
2024 is proving to be the best year yet! A 3 hour sidemen video 😭💞
Nobody is concerned with how out of touch KSI is?😭
Best video in a long time
No one voting for vik is just gold 🤣
KSI: I'm to rich for this 😂😂😂
This was so brilliant.
Sidemen 👏👏👏
Do a cheap Vs cheap holiday and a spenny Vs Spenny holiday
40:28 that catch from jj tho
the best
2:58:37 This is the part in sleepovers when everyone is too giggly to sleep 😂
At 2:12:48 what is this song called
The ending was so wholesome
Absolute banger <3
Casually clicks on Sidemen Sunday cos duh Doesn't check video length Sees 3hours  Dear god, I'm in for a sick time
36:30 bro why do they have sniper red dots on their foreheads 😭

This video was a blast  Oh and seems like we got our true FATNEEK back
1:16:49 Yo, that one there was a violation🎶
Vik deserves better.
Tobi when he learned to skii was so wholesomw
bro won another shot and said im still shooting😂
I dont get it why vik just dont leave at this point.... (Every video is gettiing more dirty)
Man that ending with bad team was so wholesome. 😊
Why is no one talking about the fact that Harry sniffed the stranger's sock (1 hour 16 minutes-ish) 🤮
new most viewed vid ?
Who agrees Vik deserves better? 👇
“one more video before i sleep”   The video:
Bro why did JJ get the Attack on Titan Cam xD
Like, they are livin my dreams, such a beautiful placee, I wish I can go there in the future tooo, so amazing!!
What I gift from the sidemen 3 hours how nice of then
why harry smell the sock
3 HOURS!!!! at this point they need to start airing these in theatres lol
plz more of kashper
They were insufferable in the bus part of the video
3 hours of just vik yapping 💀
3hr video and Tobi is in like 10 mins of it, his career is being carried
JJ is such a fun sponge
Simon doesnt moan like JJ and Vikk but he is really spiteful with his comments n he def means it.
People still aren't finished with this vid yet lol
1:07:14 “No I’m still shooting!”😂 the funniest old guy I’ve ever seen
I’m gonna be honest. This is one of the best videos yet from Josh. Really well made video!
Gotta have been one of my fav sidemen Sundays ever! From Harry and Ethan swimming to holiday to freezy Randy and lux surprising the rest of the boys in the cabin, this vid was an absolute banger! ❤
Banger
the snoring sent me bro
Sidemen need to try skiing in canada
casper is such a highlight
Imagine saving up all year for a holiday and then being mocked by KSI 😂
Watched the whole video, it was actually great. I love the ideea of a 2-3 hour movie like this, keep them coming!
1:01:39 has gotta be the best moment 😂
@2:16:51 IS CURSED
3 hour sidemen sunday this is going to be fun!
Josh pressuring Harry to drink was a big no no
The attitude on the bad team actually stinks. They could make it such a good time, but all they're doing is making it worse for themselves. KSI wasn't even going to sleep in the cabin and he was still bitching 😂😂
3 h!? Birthday came early.. (March 22.)
Bring Casper back for more videos
Yall did my man Vik so dirty
love how this video should of actually been published in winter
The best breakfast ever!! 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
I’m happy about the 3 hours, it’s made my week. People need to not take anything literal, they do this for our entertainment
Coldplay paradise song was just perfect 2:12:44
Vikk was Done dirty, he better get a good one next. Ethan, Tobi and Simon deserve the shittiest most stinkiest worst holiday
This is one of the best sidemen sunday's so funny so wholesome and so different loved it ❤❤
A movie
yo the bad teams outfits were kinda sick tho😭
Bro 3 hours ik yall were drained
3 hour long sidemen Sunday best Sunday ever ❤️❤️
Whoever chose the music has good taste.
6:00 woah Theo mentioned by Harry? That’s something I never expected
I’ll do a push-up for every sub I get
Probably best sidemen sunday since the best one 😭
Just watched 1,5 hours time to sleep will watch the rest tommorow love the 3 hour its basically Oppenheimer length all over again
why is nobody talking about toby absolutely smashing that obstacle course. jeeez 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
KSI thinks screaming is the peak of comedy. He is easily the most annoying sideman
1.1 million people are watching this at the same time as me 💀
Crazy how people are watching it as soon as it came out and still haven’t finished it 😅
JJ is genuinely insufferable. He’s so stuck up and distasteful, it’s not even an act. I hope somebody humbles him
3 hours 😶‍🌫️ hold up, this is a whole movie 🙌
2:11:26 very nice of vik to help the camera man
we need this guy on more bad team videos 😂 who is kashper?
This needs a highlights video of the best bits, it was longggg
After so many months... We can finally say that Fatneek is back in his PRIME...
why did that guy punch simon hahahaha
2:07:40 that is a grim camera angle
It’s good to see the cheap team enjoy as well 😊
Poor Steve. Since JJ switched he had too as well
3 hours is insane LOL
3 hours.....i`m exciited fr
Ethan "Tobi Banged his head on the slide" Harry "GOOD" Tobi "ethan to good team"  😭THE TIMING LOLLL
3hrs? Lets go🤣
3hrs video damn
THREE HOURS OF SIDEMEN CONTENT?! HELL TO THE YES!
Best Sidemen sunday this year and in a while!  That Harry closeup on the bridge is gonna be iconic
I feel like the “good team” should of stayed on the bus 🚌
i wanted vick to be in a good team😢
Credit to the cameramen for skiing and filming
37:05 VIK mocking KSI😭
idk know how i feel about everyone kinda manipulating harry into drinking
yeah I am just going to leave it at that 43:25
I'm still shooting sent me!!!!!!!
harry "there is a private jet landing right now, it could take them somewhere else" vIk "it could also crash into the side of a mountain"
Zerkaa was really pissed at everyone voting among us better than sidemen sunday and upped the quality quite a bit
I swear Josh put all the Nigerians on the Good Team on purpose.
VaJayJay 😂😂😂😂
so peak non of them voted vikk, he literally gave away his box in a recent SDMN video…
Vik x Casper
Might be my fav. Holiday video and FYI VIK needs justice 🫡🔥
In these vids I always route for JJ to get the bad team just cause his reaction its hilarious but im happy he got the good team this time
What’s Josh got against Vik, hes never in the good team.
1:32:35 I love how Harry always sticks up for Vik
nah harry smelling the sock had me dead
Massive shoutout to the cameraman trying to ski and shoot throughout! What an effort!
The 200$ vacation includes dinner flight and room hmm seems fishy
tbf this video was such a banger but the vibes of the bad team at the end were NOT it lol
Here's the audience again 😂😂😂😂
That man punched minter hard as he could 😂
I actually prefer the cheep teams outfits 🙄🤷🏼‍♂️
JJ’s still in shape but he’s stacked on the lbs
3 hours long. i’ve got a semi on
the montages with music backing are such a good addition
nobody loves being rich more than KSI 😂
bruno mars is so in debt sidemen got license to his song lmao
W Casper
Wild to think this came out two hours ago and people are still watching while I just clicked on
No votes for vik is crazy! Especially after last video
Whatever happened with this video, it was so much more organic than some if the previous. Keep it up boys
3 hr vid Iv been blessed
1:16:21 Naaaa Harry 👃
can already tell this is gonna be a goated video
I need mota back for a surprise sidemen video 😂
2:16:41 I'VE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY LIFE💀
Is no-one gonna talk about harry sniffing the sock at 1:16:20
Bad team need an attitude check 😂
What happened to the guy who punched Simons spud? We need to know!
1:18:22 lmao
Both teams playing wavelength at the end of the night was a awesome parallel
the fact that everybody watching this is from right now that started when it came out all have 1 hour left LOL
I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so much at a sidemen sunday before 😂 jj on the zip line
"Water is a atom… oh wait it’s 2 atoms" Ksi
I'm skipping school to watch sidemen
2:21:35 Freya is gonna have a blast with this one lad 😂
I actually feel so bad for vik that he got no votes 😢 he deserves more good team experiences
1:16:23 *Harry sniffs sock*
The thumbnail spoil who’s the good team is, I wish they would either not have the teams in the thumbnail or swap some of the team members
This is what I wait for💪🏻💪🏻
3HOURS WHAT THE F
2:16:40 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Finally a long sidemen video
Jj is a big pu**y when i comes to stuff like this, bro has to get driven down the mountain😅
1:26:13 Harry’s face 😂😂
The editing and music on this was banging
Vikk boy man , whatta guy
2:16:41  THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST CLIPS ON THE INTERNET HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
“It could also crash into the side of a mountain”  The comedic timing from Vik was perfection
The Zerknydercut
2hrs after uploading and its nearly at one mil good shii guys 🎉❤
The next banger??!!
The security moving in when that fella punches Simon's hand
wow boys, 2024 is the year of the sidemen. 3 hour long video? damn
a sidemen challenge when they go to a cabin in the woods no phones no internet no tv for a few days, and just good vibes video and how they entertain themselves
1:39:32 ah yes, my favorite part of these types of videos, the part where a whiny JJ gets tamed by some flamboyant instructor
The guy being surprised it’s Harry’s first time skiing like he hasn’t snowboarded for years 😂
Casper is hilarious! 😂
The way Harry kept putting Vik and Simon through a rollercoaster of emotions and hope and the cameraman letting them cook nothing 🔥🤣💀
Honestly, 3 hours is too much man
Harry - vikk give them a goodnight kiss😂🫶🏻
the possibility of memes from this video is insane 😂
1:59:12 I lost it 😂😂😂
Smashing 2024 year for the real
3 hours?! we living today
1:04:52  that man defo got roughed up by their boduguard right after
Sick vid boys!
vik deserves good team
i’ll always stan vik, he’s the hopeful, cheerful backbone to every “bad” team (even in the last one where they were just trying to see how far they can get outside of europe) all while bro is suffering from a painful incurable disease 🥹 just loving life the best that he can 🫶🏻 hopefully he has a “worth it” good team experience in the future
This is a mess and I love it
not harry sniffin the womans sock at 1:16:08 on the right
🔥 vid
the sniff 😭  1:16:19
Ayo, our fatneek is back.
Can someone make a I'm too rich for this compilation
JJ is scared for his life at every point had me rolling every point
Big ups to vikk srsly big ups
One of best ones top 3
Love the sidemen for their dedication ❤️
Phil instructir would have been very funny
Big up to the editors, Big up to Josh, Big up to the boys. What a banger 🎉🎉🎉
Im 12 minutes in and this video is great but its sad to see JJ not being humble at all.
Miniminter will be on the bad team next time 😂😂
JJ didn't deserve to be on the good team after the way he acted on the bus.
Where the bus people actors or were the good teams just pricks
KSI = Most funniest 😂
Fat JJ is back😂😂😂😂
This is like a movie
1:58:09 I am german and I have no clue what this guy is attempting to say 😂
1:18:15 30 year old man
“Right here, right now” in the intro brought me straight back to the early 2000s
Another great sidemen vid always look forward to sidemen Sundays best time of the week and on a side note in 1:16:20 y did Harry sniff the sock 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭 I’m dead such a good video and 3 hours long is entertaining love the sidemen sooo much ❤️❤️
Va JJ 😂
53:00 we ski into them😂
This video Earned a like from me just because of the KSI Torture XD
the german guy had me crying
Honestly this video gave me 2017 era sidemen vibes absolutely incredible video 🎉
Fun fact: the moment this comment is posted, no one has fully watched the 3 hour Sidemen Sunday video
This is such a good video 💯💯
2:16:40 had me in tears 😂😂😂
watched full video in one sitting ❤❤❤
Ngl, 3 hours is too long
52:21 “that’s a micro aggression as well” 😂
Banger <3 Big up the editing team, someone should post the ss of the final editing screen
Ksi looking like 2021 ksi 💀
3 hours?! I love getting a new movie to watch every Sunday this is awesome
Intro song on point 🔥🔥
I love the new take in the beginning, the confusing and excitement. The editing is fire as well
Anybody catch harry sniffing the sock he got 😂
This was such a banger Weldone lads ksi was so funny learning to ski 😂😂😂
WHYD HARRY SMELL THE SOCK LOL 1HR 16
Vik always gets stiffed
3 hours?! I mean they did say it was gonna be a big shoot
Josh hosting is so good. He plans everything perfect
Jj and Ethan in the sauna. Not only did they look like a pair of whales but they also give call outs like em too 🤣🤣🤣🐋🐋
3 HOURS?!??
What Fast and Furious movie is this? 3 bloody hours sheesh
36:41 someone wants to kill Simon
0:45 the best youtube video intro ever
Three hour sidemen sunday? Am i dreaming I know I drank 20 guiness yesterday must be a delusion
By the looks of it a few minutes i still am unable to remotely have a most wild idea of how much animosity is between Josh and Ethan and Josh being the guy in charge of the videos and Ethan slowly being able to get back at him here and there but DAMN. Ethan being in the team not looking as great a spot now. CRAZYYYYYYYYY.
51:30 lmao vik!
The snoring 😭😭😭🤣 it sounded like Vik 💀
Did Harry just sniff that sock?
1:16:20 I’d do it too harry 😭
My face hurts😂😂
Honestly there should be more challenges where 1 person from the bad team goes to the good team. But not every episode just randomly
1:04:50 first time ive seen security actually move
Holy shit lads, 3 hours??? Thank you VERY much.
Our fatneek is back
wahooooo
Vik deserves a good team for once he's been on a streak of bad team
jj 2:07 hahahaaaaaaaa
one of the best sidemen videos in a minute
This video was insane. Just couldnt stop laughing
1:18:15 🤣🤣🤣
This video was a banger sidemen will never go out of style
2:16:40 That angle is insane
Kashper is brilliant 😂
1:08:24 where’s the abs 😮😮
KSI too funny 😂
I love how Tobi just buckles inwards when he laughs with Ethan😂
Fatneek returns
Honestly the bad team isn't even that bad, nice cozy Airbnb plus on a sick mountain. I don't get the complaints?
JJ’s famous words “ im to rich for this, i wanna die”
JJ never enjoys any activity whether he's on the good or the bad team. Huge buzz kill for someone trying to enjoy the video
Hello from🇸🇪
🐐🐐🐐
i just hope vik gets a nice sunday soon
27:47 the way tobis head just dragged along the ground way too funny🤣
This is the best video they made
Love all the sidemen but jj is starting to be unbearable latley just thinks he’s above everyone when really most the other boys carries the videos cause all he does is whine
Woahhh 3 hours!? A whole movie! 🤗
3 HOURS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
3 hrs🫨🫨
I think vik should hand pick 2 Boys and he should go on a expensive holiday
Banger
last 10m goated ;DDD
The laughs of the bad team at the end before the sleep was the best part of the video. Made me miss the sleepovers with my friends 🥹
I just start watching i now its gonna be banger my fav channel for reason
I swear Simon is waiting for the day when he has to butler the other team
A 3 hour Sidemen Sunday? It's gonna be a loooong dinner
Banger
2:40:06 gotta be one of the best holiday proformances ever 😂
damn jj got kinda fat lol
I love JJ but whenever he's on the bad team he drastically change the vibe, like the boys were fine before he joined.
@1:07:40 JJ is back to being a fatneek again 😁🤜🤛
Ksi needs to humble himself shouting “im too rich for this” on a coach full of normal people.
Ksi thinks he’s above everything
Yeah this video just made JJ and Ethan look bad tbh
Damnnnnn😳
ofc harry snifs the sock😂😂
1:51:56 Harry getting annoyed at josh is so funny 😂😂
JUSTICE FOR 123!!!
please have casper be in more videos
21:44 cheeky little bookmark
1:01:49 viks not having it 😭
BRO HARRY IS THE BEST LMFAO HIS REACTIONS HIS EVERYTHING IS FUNNY AF
naaah the shots at 1:25:20 are mental😍😍😍
please tell me harry smelling the sock didnt go unnoticed hahahaha
JJ is so detached from reality that it's not even funny anymore
not me waiting a whole week for a new video😅
dang, 3 hours long
Casper was jokes
Yeah nah yeah. This is the sort of video I don’t like ngl. 3 hours is way too long and $v$$$ videos are so overdone and repetitive now
24:51 Harry is his fathers son through n through "i might have to tune in " hahahahahaha
😮 3 hours!
39: 48 funniest bit
I wanna know wich chalet the nigerians were at, kinda want to book it
Banger🔥
3 hour Sideman Video All i ever Wanted!
3 hour vid = W
Thanks for the 3hr vid. The big videos are awesome
1:00:36 lol 😂
10:07 say it a few more times prikstar
Love the use of licensed songs like with ChrisMD's vids, really adds a nice touch
On 2:16:40. 🤣🤣
2:16:40 had me creasing XD
the audio at 55:00 isn't great
Honestly one of the best vids
This is gonna be a long meal
Well done Josh !❤
Ethan's hair looks better spiked up while blonde ngl.
I was kinda looking forward for JJ to go to the hostel
OHH MY GOODNESS 3 HOUR SIDEMEN SUNDAY
I was at that airport a day before 😮
Can I get a hoyyyyyyyyyahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh (like)
2:16:32 Harry running like a Titan from AOT 😂😂😂
Why do they always have to hire someone to be annoying for a full hour. The guy following vik, Simon, and JJ is horrendously annoying. I skipped every time he came up on screen
Fatboy slim to start, oooo baby 👌
1:16:20 harry sniffing the girl socks
Blue team Simon, Harry, and Vik aka team Karen
Watching this vid at 4 am in India
This may be the best video yet
Feel bad for vikk 😔
they got snipers on em and no one even told em 😳😳 36:22
i want what Kasper was on🤣
We need summer holiday like 3 hour long also
LETS MAKE A PETITION FOR KSI TO HOST A HOLIDAY VIDEO
yes finally a longer video
How is Josh always the host😅
2:46:40 that transision to harry and ethan is everything i ever needed
Casper really made the second half of the video for me. He had me laugh alot. Deffintly one of the better guests
one of the best videos ever imo
Why is the videos so short? I wish they made their sidemen Sundays longer
JJ moaning over the food is hilarious. 😂
Tell me why the bad teams snow suits look better
People talk about Simon being a moaner but fk me he doesn't complain half as much as JJ 😂😂
Good thing i stocked my fridge, 3H sidemen sunday. This is gonna be a banger!
why did harry smell the sock
9 out of 10 sorry Josh it hooned 😂
The editing in this video was 🔥🔥
30 is way too old to be playing a spoiled brat "character" and literally doing baby speak 💀 it's not even entertaining, it's just awkward watching a grown man behave like that 😭
Why u gotta do this, tomorrow is my exam now I will have to enjoy my next 3 hrs 😭😭
Imagine Josh said if they finish the list then Jj would have to switch teams
Sidemen have cooked this year
The music in this video bangs
Change my mind but the firsts outfits of the bad team are bangers!!
josh is done it again
It feels cool to know I’ve been in the exact same city the side men have been to
Jj looks like the most unfunny, spoiled and annoying person ever man. Money got him bad smh
harry just casually sniffing the sock had me creasing 🤣
The production quality of these vids is seriously amazing. Good Job to the Team👊. Also love the fact we see some "behind the scenes" of how it actually is with having a camera crew tag along, etc. Banger vid🔥
Casper for the 8th sideman anyone?
staying awake until suhur will be easy with this video
The funniest part is when jj told the chef that the potatoes need a bit work
where did they get futurecanoes never ending raclette from
W
mad to think no ones has watched this whole vid yet in 1x speed
@01:04:50 I swear rock paper scissors guy about to punch simon in the face but secca grabbed his hand!!
Omfg I just watched the Europe one today for nostalgia and now this 😍
Has Ksi gone fat? Genuine question
Best vid ever! , and I’m only half way through
Who’s not rich but still want to Geneva airport within the last few years
Yeah the sidemen are obviously millionaires but pls stop basing every video off of money, just isn't very with the times in this current climate
Jj and tobi have been in the same team every time
39:22 LOL 😂 VIK . I am waiting for FREYA'S reaction on this 😂
The color grading IS SICKKKK
Omg this is GLORIOUS!!
Cashpur is elite! So good they got him back in another vid
Felt really bad for Vik when no one picked him. Even worse that he’s basically never got the good team.
I really feel bad for vik, when he got to know that no one voted him, especially after wt happened last week and he was never in a good team ever in EU.
36:30 someone ready to snipe them😂
Need more longer sidemen Sundays like this this was great
The guy punching Simon tho
KSI's narcassism knows no bounds
4:31 nah jj is so disconnected from society 😂
Unpopular opinion 3 hours is too long
wait why did i cry when no one picked Vikk. I need to stop watching them, too much emotionally invested jeez 1:36:00
2:04:26 - 2:05:17 From this Josh seems fairly good at skiing. At least know one ever talks about it. He is prob third best at winter sports stuff in the Sidemen
Go off sidemen editors
Got to be a banger
Kacper made this video
I miss when jj wasn’t too rich for this. All he does is complain now whenever he’s not just sitting in a bathtub doing nothing
came to watch a sidemen sunday not a movie, so it must be a banger
We should do what Vik Said Cheap vs. Expenseve vs. Josh
from nowhere jj became likeable
Sidemen be putting on movies now 😮
1:16:18 nahhhh harrrryyy😂 bro had to get a little wiff in😂😂😂
3 hour sidemen movie!!!!!
2:16:43 Harry looking like a titan
The old chap well wanted a tear up with Simon rock paper scissors 😂
33:20 this is why jj is always on the bad team he can't enjoy the good team 😂😂
1:16:19 not harry just sniffing the sock
JJ was on his eliminate in this vid
Ethan n jj on the same team is comedy always
I love when Josh does it. He truly gets it
2:16:41 Attack on Titan Harry Edition
Too many ads
Kacper the 🐐🐐
1:01:39 cool filter
JJ: im not letting any man put meat in my mouth  Also JJ: 40:20
Harry sniffing the sock is so real
Vik never being in the expensive team gotta suck
3 hour movie chat, best Sunday
Look forward to Vikk Finally getting a good team
casper is an absolute legend  banger of a video today
i stopped watching after jj got switched. that’s legit why all three of them are the karen’s of the sidemen.
2:16:40 Calfreezy?👀😂
This is like a movie. 3 hours long all I need is popcorn and prime
wear your seat belts lads its not worth it
3 Hours?!!
Fatnneek kdi
Harry’s face when he realized they still had to do all the tasks
Audio is buggered when Josh is talking to Harry and when Ethan talks to camera in car..just sayin.
KSI becomes more intolerable every week.
bro 2 hours in and almost 1 mill views
We love josh bangers
Best sidemen sunday video in my opionion. The views, banter and vibes were immaculate. ❤
Casper with jj is something I need more of 😂
They need to put ksi on every bad team now just to keep his ego in check
All in favour on making josh the host again say I!!
38:20 dead 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Nahh Vik got Violated 🤣
3 hours, holy moly
bbroo the snoring killed me
does Tobi drink now?
Cinematic Sidemen >>
1:00:00 it's the forehead angle that gets me every time 🤣🤣🤣
I thought that 3hr timestamp was wrong :O Dune 2 was shorter than this video
Throwback to when KSI said he would rather die than take the meat of another man in his mouth from a knife 😂
Honestly jjs mentality is of a toddler if he doesn’t like something he throws a paddy
I'm sorry but 1:01:38 made me laugh "I feel so fat" it's ok JJ, we all have those moments
The boys went above and beyond the clouds 💙 2:13:30
Honestly felt so bad for Vikk this video
This is long and kinda boring. I’m sad 😔
1:16:19 harry having a cheeky sniff
is fat neek back after saying he’s keeping the 6 pack lmao
Last 10 minutes was really wholesome! Esp the ending cut 💜
The editing and music montages are on point!!!
1:16:20 wtf did Harry sniff the sock 😭😭😭
The last few minutes are actually jokes. Just good funny vibes🤣
Behzinga on top form this vid ❤
JJ deserved nothing but the bad team after effectively mocking the peasants on a holiday that he’d loved to have been on himself with the boys when he was 18
Fatneek’s back😂
23:51 how is it not copyrighted?
harry sniffin that sock is hilarious
Those sounds from ksi are not family friendly
JJ never forgets to entertain us
I have a place in Les Gets near Morzine, this is cool to think that Ethan, KSI and Toby stayed near there!
Nah they really did dirty to Vik. I hope Vik really get the good team next time. I would been pissed if it was me for real.
Nah. No way Harry doesnt know how to ski.
VIK WAS SHAKIGN LIKE ALEAF
Idk about this editing and songs 🤔
1:14:36 had me creasing
So a Galaxy S23 Ultra is an NPC phone according to KSI🙃
What an awesome vid
As if it cost $200 to do that holiday… snow skiing is heaps expensive and they aren’t actually having a bad time… like no joke the $200 team is like a pretty good holiday for me and my family
1:16:18  Harry just sniffs the sock after complaining about how she just took it off 😭
CASHPUR THE GOAT
This vid is astonishing 🔥, i loved it. Had my fav 3 in a team and was very funny/entertaining ❤
2:57:30 to 2:59:90  IS the BEST  thing ever in a sidemen video !!!!!!!!!!!!!   The end Was the funniest thing ever in a sidemen video  LOL
Honestly, I feel bad for Harry. I have someone I care for so much and has liver failure. I felt it when he said the whites of his eyes turned yellow. For those who don't know that is the beginning symptoms of liver failure.
Sidemen x HIMYM crossover (Woooo) iykyk
Who is this Kasper guy😂😂😂
Jj needs to be humbled
needless to say the monkeys did good on the monkey bars
Production is insane🔥🔥
At 2:07:32, it looks like JJ had a great time with Simon.
nick was so humble
ABSOLUTE BANGER, exceeded all my expectation even after all the hype created for it. I am at the half mark and literally not a single dull moment, jokes and personality flying around by the second. I don't think there has been a better sidemen sunday that can top this. The best part being that both the teams are equally entertaining to watch and each and everyone is in their core element that they are known for.
Tobi is so wholesome. He was so happy to see Harry skiing so well.
Nah everyone here so far ain't even finished with the video yet 😭😭😭
1:26:28 Tobi's reaction is gold
I felt so bad for the guy asking for a photo 😂😅
Production is insane, such a good watch!
Kashper for the win
2:49:02 backflip
Vídeo same length as Oppenheimer 😂😂
Ksi is fat
the sidemen bring "holiday with the boys" to a new level
2:48:50 tbf they are kinda eating
Ethan is genuinely hilarious in this one, top form geez
The videos just keep getting better and better!!!
They way we're all still here I feel like we've bonded in these 3 hrs
1:00:25 jj omg 😂😂😂
It’s crazy how the bad teams trip is a trip that people like me would go on
The JJ forehead angle is iconic
This will become your most viewed video, amazing editing
bad team or not that look fun tho
31:07 they kinda look like Power rangers
2:47:50  woow
1:16:18 bro Harry u wild bro literally smelt the sock 😂😂😂
Nah Casper was next level man, I havent laughed that hard in a while
Editors cooked on this one
this a whole movie- 3 hours gadamn 🙌
Ksi fatneek again
yo this is basically two videos. no spoilers tho
❤
Nah tobi sliding down on his face 😂😂
15:06 that ad transition is GOOD!!! 😂🔥 Big up the Editors 💯🔥
This vid slowed down so much after the teams changed
Sidemens uploading movies now
No but JJ's face at 35:20 is actually so cute though
2:47:00 lmaoooo
Getting to the point I'm gunna stop watching these cause I'm sick of Harry throwing his teddy out of the cot an getting what he wants, he's a two face mardy little boy
2:16:41 😂
This is better than a movie
There's 3 hours gone
❤️‍🩹🙏🏼👑🐐
2:16:39 had me absolutely crying😂😂
Ksi needs to be stopped
The best group in the world
Love the way u can have songs into videos now it makes such a good difference
i think i watched a documentary or a movie we need more of this
Everyone on the group does not vibe with vikk anymore .
E
“The worst they can say is no”  JJ “why is this NPC asking for a picture”
Harry is glowing
The perfect length
This was a sad video for me because I saw how vikk's always being downplayed inspite of he being so cheerful to everyone. 🙃🙃
that's a SICK intro. first 1min of this video was BEAUTIFULLY edited (music and all). EDIT: only the 1st minute was great... not a great video...
3 hours worth of content to watch while i work🔥🫶🏽
2hr 16 is a new meme
i will die on this hill, certain ksi fanboys are so unbearable and embarrassing
I appreciate what the Sidemen does for us. 3 hour video is insane. This a awesome Simon Sunday.
I can not do 3 hours, the length of your Vijaya's are becoming ridiculous! This is YouTube not IMAX!
18:13 bro.
Harry is actually so boring saying he can’t be bothered the whole trip he’s so negative at least vic is there keeping there team positive
The sleep over was soo wholesome
The cheap team's night really did give Benidorm vibes and i LOVE it
Jj needs put on bad team for the foreseeable and vik deserves to be on the good team, he’s my fav and deserves better !
This is going to be a banger, 1 mill likes incoming
I cant believe KSI referenced Karl Pilkington😂
Ayo they making full length movies now
The instructor bit tho 🔥
Long on but worth the watch
Jj is become a fatneek 💪💪💪💪
Poor vik 😢 no one voting him
love that it's 3 hours long, and the edit of the house of group 2 with the music got me feeling excited
59:19 it's a what? i cant hear what he says
14:03 Yeah guys! Ethan’s Black! 18:13 … 23:52 How did they not get copyrighted for all this music? 33:42 Jason Momoa if he was Black? 40:26 … 1:22:40 … 1:24:51 Ha! Nonce. 1:29:30 … 1:37:26 Not only has Vik never been on the good team, but given the choice, they don’t even want him on the good team!
Seeing Vic getting progressively angry is amazing
Is it just me that low-key liked Simon and Harry’s ski outfits!? 😂
Well this time dobby gave Harry a sock
iwl lost respect for jj, Ethan and tobi for laughing at that guy on the bus and calling him a npc.
tobi and jj can’t do monkey bars 🤔
The editor on that commercial transition. big up that guy!
Naw the German man needs his own show. Well done I was laughing every time he was on screen
Josh that was DIABOLICAL
The fact that nobody has finished this vid yet 😂
TBH, for 3 hours, this video is dead. Could have been cut down to 30 minutes and been better. So long, so little content.
Editing on this video is 🔥
for some reason i thought jj would do good on the monkey bars
WE NEED MORE HOLIDAY
50 min in… teams should’ve really been switched
😂😂😂😂😂😂 I have to say this is one of the funniest and the longest and the best holiday edition
im sorry but 3 hours is craaaaaaaazy
bro the intro is such a banger mate plzzz make more good music good editing
Is it me or do everyone skip most of the good team stuffs
goated tbh
Nice humiliation ritual for JJ
JJ n CASPER ahahaha dying man literally dying
THIS IS LOOKING SO GOOD WHAT
Sidemen Sunday, just went up another level. No catching these boys.
the ending is just perfect
20:39 - 20:41 Ethans scream sounds like Lego Yoda dying
vik getting no votes its actually sad
58:00 why censor a pool table?...
I got 55 mins left going strong 😅
Real life super man daaaa
Anyone know what that brand of jacket is that Harry’s wearing?
JJ doesn’t deserve to be on good teams
1:08:12 jj acting like dad at the playground 🤣
Spoiler blocker❌❌
3 HOURS WHAT
1:14:46 had me dead
im happy to see harry maturing and thinking about his drinking habits
Was this the place where they did hide and seek and ethan stayed on the swing on top of the pool?
38:19 ur mum josh
Wild switch up from the Maldives.
1:16:18 first instinct is to sniff the random womans sock. 1:18:35 second instinct, put it on *over* the shoe.
25:17 lol W Ethan 😂
1:53:01 Now that's a VikStar
love the music choices, good music really adds to the vid
Poor Vik, gets a good team in almost none of the videos and no one even voted him 😂😢  not to mention 2 days before this shoot he was puking and seriously ill and still turned up for this shoot.  edit: but tbh, apart from their STAYING ROOMS/HOUSE, experiences were mostly the same, and Vikk enjoyed them while JJ hates them while in both Good and Bad team.  and I do not know why Simon and Ethan gets called out for being a cry baby while JJ is a lot worse.
Been on since 30 sec out n havent done
39:49 I don't care if it's cringe this was hilarious
56:50 so real of harry, no love to denmark <3
A 3 hour sidemen video it doesn’t get better then this
I’m sorry!! What!!! 3 hours😅😍
Tbh honest I love how jj tobi and ethan was enjoying the view when they saw the sun touching the clouds
18:15 They got the license for 24k magic 🥹 and a 3 hour Sidemen Sunday is just unbelievable. You’ve outdone yourselves with this one 🙏
I have just opened the video and will be disappointed if Harry doesn’t sniff snow
1:07:55 That swing is for one thing, and one thing only xD
Good vid 👍
I think this is the end of the channel
Thanks ksi and bezinga for the lovely screenshots xx
White privilege
I'm sensing there might be a Hide n Seek / Sardines video in the future 😅😅😅
should have split the video into 2 parts 🙂
3hrs Damn my guy!
Food is going to taste AMAZING
3 hour video is actually crazy
3hr of sidemen what a treat !!
Bro everyone ganged up on JJ
Who wants Casper in more videos! 😅  The fella is absolutely hilarious! 🤣
Can’t wait to watch this in bed with some dr pepper
Bye migros💀
3 hours hell yeah
A proper movie, well done boys
these are gonna start being sidemen sundays to mondays at this point
Where did simon go 😂
Why did harry sniff the sock😭
3 HOURS IS NUTS I LOVE IT
The"bad teams" always look like they are having a better time lol seems like they do more and experience more
2:21:52 thats stunning
36:18 conflicted sniper
Safe to say best one so far
KSLIES
I feel poor after seeing JJ’s reaction 🙆🏽‍♂️😂
jj should be cancelled for the bus
BEST MOVIE EVER
Sidemen parkhorse would be AMAZING, pure entertainment
1:38:56 of course Harry knows where the best snow is
3hour video is a blessing. ZERKAA ON TOP😂
Rip Harry's cheese
This 3 hour sidemen thing has just made me wet the bed
This 3 hour video is probably a test. If it does well it might fit into a plan for once a month content, later on down the line. Even if it is we will enjoy it anyway.
poor vik no votes:((
KSI the only one who can fit a camera on his forehead 🤣
2:21:35 wroetozerk?
JJ was so rude to the people on the bus at the start.
is it just me or am i the only one skipping the good team 😅 at this point, i enjoy watching the cheap team especially if its vik, simon, and harry cause whatever team they’re on, it’s fun to watch and they make the most of it. hope they get on a good team, it’s been a while, think they deserve it 😆 ahem josh make it happen
The snoring is mental
Bro imagine that girl has just had a random bloke go up to her, ask for an item of clothing, and then randomly sniff her sock @1:16:19 and walk off 😂😂
2 hour 24 when vik does the rashford celebration and no one laughed had me in tears 😂
Josh needs some hair dye
Some incredible editing. Man sometimes I forget all the work behind these videos. It's not only the 7 sidemen. There is a whole team behind it including JayJay his bodyguard 😂. Respect and love ❤
The JJ head cam kills me man lol
bro is ksi getting fat again??
3HOURS!?!?
that song shoulda been used for longer in the intro. what a hyping song.
Hear me ou, both teams get the bugdet of 10 000 but one is used for bad scenarios
That Side+ Ad was insane
Ethan has one of the best laughs
8:34, 8:58, 11:05, 14:10, 35:06, 35:48, 40:26, 47:49, 49:13, 56:44, 59:59, 1:01:43, 1:01:49, 1:09:06, 1:12:20, 1:26:25, 1:29:19, 1:29:46, 1:30:30, 1:32:48, 1:34:55, 1:40:13, 1:42:34, 1:48:24, 1:49:50, 1:51:03, 1:53:29, 1:55:00, 1:56:38, 2:18:14, 2:34:33, 2:46:21, 2:58:09, 2:59:34
It's repetitive now honestly
JJ needs to be on the bad team!
Also how tf does jj always get the good team
Yyyyeeeeessssssss 🎉
SO GOOD KNOCKED IT OUT THE PARK
36:21 saw the green dot pop up on Simon's head and I thought the boys were about to be assassinated 😂
ksi back in his fat phase
The editors knocked it out of the park!!!
1:01:36 why does JJ look like big smoke from Gta  San Andreas
1:11:52 My last two brain cells
1:16:19 Aint no way he just smelled that 😆
2:16:48 im dead
Harry just straight up sniffs a random woman's sock 1:16:19
Harry talking to a guy in the video caught me off-guard lmfao.
3 hours Jesus Christ
3 hour video is crazyyyyyyy❤
Tobis drip 11:22
The whole NPC thing was so cringe from Ethan and JJ
Calfreezy drinking JJ's piss was peak Sidemen content.
What’s jj’s deal w/ micro-aggression😂?
ethan turning the camera around to show their view was too real.
Ksi is always on the best team
bro im so sick of randolph, callux and freezy always being in vids theyre so jarring
3hr video YESSSSS!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Yo. This is longer than Oppenheimer
ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE VIDEO. BEST THREE HOURS. loving the long form contentttt✨️🤌
Bro 3 hrs
Btw those guys on the bus were actors
Josh’s audio is messed up at 54:26 for the whole phone call
i just canned be assed
20mins in and this looks like some kind of a Hollywood movie 🍿
I liked my own comment
big up the productions on this one
Btw guys those guys on the bus were actors
Shock Ksi gets good team so he can't be upset and ruin the mood of the video... again🙄
really think vik deserved the good team, was sad to see no-one voted for him
Sidemen Sunday is elite BUT THREE HOURS that’s crazy but im bout to watch until 1am
2:12:48 wow
Come to me va-j j
On the next video Josh is 100% being put the bad team by Simon, Vik and Harry... was hoping for Josh to bait JJ, Tobi and Ethan making them think they're the good team... obviously he doesn't have brains to pull it off... i want JJ to be on the bad team next time he gets niced too much wherever it's holiday vids
Vikkstar is the bad team 🐐 Makes everything optimistic
When was the last time Vik was on the good team lmao
1:16:19  WHY DID HARRY SMELL THE SOCK?!?!?!!?!! 😭😭😭
Content is so much shitter when they don't drink
josh could be a pretty great serial killer
Best video to watch during Ramadan
3 HOURS OF SIDEMEN CONTENT! WE GOT A MOVIE WITH A SEQUEL IN 1 VIDEO!
why does vik always get the bad team????
Petition for vik to be on the good team next no matter what
oh my they're cute like the Teletubbies❤ and Power Rangers😁
Ksi is so annoying
Longest sidemen Sunday ever great video boys
proper jarring this ksi guy
Playing Fat Boy Slim in the intro wow budget gona wild
The teams should be done in a random drawing at the beginning of the video so that it doesn't seem as rigged 😂
What’s the song they used at 27:48 ???
3 HOURS!?!?!?!? I clicked on without even realising TT
The editors went crazy on this one. 3 hours is madddd
Vikstar explains the mentality behind 9/11 52:50
3 hours, boys you do treat us well
Ksi has been loving good after the last fight, eating good
2:59:28 The happy ending of the bad team
It was Posted 2 Hours ago so none have finished yet so the 5K comments are fake
Ethan was being a douche with the NPC stuff
Vik needs a good team
wow
Staying up to 1 to watch this
Why are they all so bad at skiing. They are rich
Nah Ethen needs to go back to his original hair color cause his hair looks wired
When the guy asked for a picture I was dying hahaha
3h last goooooooooo
3 hours hell yeeeh
color grading was top
Poor Harry
3 hours! Now that’s wild
2:02:23 for someone who cant ski, harrys smashing it
3 fucken hours
Petition to show not who is in the good team and who is in the bad team in the thumbnail.....
I LOVE CASPER !!!!
Crazy how no one in the comments have finished the video yet 😂😂
1:18:26 nearly made me spit out my drink lmfao
3 hour? 🥹
At 27:53 Tobi and Ethan sound like chickens haha 🐔🐔
Please put ksi on the bad team next time. He was so mean  Edit: I spoke before the end of the video karma came but he still needs a lesson
This channel just keeps getting better and better
3 hours haha that’s a surprise used to the 40 min ones
I think JJ needs to be on the bad team for the next 3 times the guy is to lucky, and needs a reality check
ksi and eathen should shut the f*** up if i was on that buss i would have ruined there whole video
53:04 the silence killed me 😂😭😂😭😂
Sick editing
3 hours is mad
They should do one of these where both teams are actually the bad team, but they don’t find out that both are the bad team until afterwards
First and i watched the 3 hour vid in 2 hours i put it 2x speed very enjoyable
2:16:40
why did harry sniff the lady's sock
Morzine is an absolutely amazing place i literally spent my 18th there 2months ago
These videos aren’t pure anymore, the house tours are so fake knowing they won’t even use 80% of it
8:06
I do snore like a train had me dying i nealry got a beaten from my dad because i laghuthed so hard💀💀
17:47 dont mind me, just putting timestamps in
3 hours??? This is gonna be a banger fr
FREE PALESTINE
I just had to watch a dog poo only on Sidemen🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why were they rude to that guy in the bus calling him an npc…. Disappointed
Tobi’s outfit 🔥
Imagine going on a vacation and having JJ screaming and complaining the whole time 😂
Just wish JJ for once would be a bit humble even if he was on the bad team.
I can’t be the only one to think JJ is annoying asf
The fact I live in morzine and can’t believe I’ve missed the sidemen 😭
It's already not a $200 holiday, but ok
Where did Simon go for abit
1:35:34 harry sticking up for vik yet again 😭
nice
Harry sniffing the sock was crazy 😂 1:16:19
KSI looking like Cleveland Brown on that swing🤣
A 3 hour video with adverts every 5 minutes 👎🏼
Honestly, Simon's team had the most fun imo
Simon's mad we love when josh plans vacation 😂😂 the dogs ❤❤❤❤omg what a dream
spolier blocker
3HR WTFFFFFFF
What’s mad is him screaming “noooo” when on the coach 😂. Them people hav saved up n looking forward to the trip 😭😂
KSI just being rude and out of touch again
1:36:40... seeing vick leave his hand out for a handshake and get ignored had me ngl🥲
Are all of these royalty free music? I sense a mute or a cut out coming soon 😂😂
Give your editors a raise, the videos are edited sooo good!!!
tobi y did u eat snow💀💀💀💀💀💀💀☠
For the Flam Pom, Fireball and Apple Juice/cider would be a better drink and be more appropriate for the name
Bro the bad team outfits are the most fire thing in the vid I would kill for those that’s steez on the mountain
46:18   *permanently*
3hour long sidemen Sunday > avengers endgame
Why isn’t Vik in the thumbnail?
I love how jj said im too rich for this
Hellooo
Why’s Viks walk 💫 Zesty 💫
3hours?
What was the green dot on Simmons head?
1:16:20 nahhhh why is bro smelling it!!!
The editors and camera crew just make this amazing production levels are insane from there first cheap vs expensive video
where did simon go in the middle of the vid
22:39 Pure jubilation from JJ 😂😂😂
This video is amazing!
Ethan looking like sam smith
Probably one of the best vids in awhile
The fact that vid’s been out for 2 hours and nobody’s yet seen the whole thing is mad 😂
0:46 bro a minute in and the editing is fire
1:36:31 it should have been vik 😢❤
When ethan was underwater hé fully looked/ enbraced The inner leprauchaun
whoever edited 18:15 needs a raise omg
I love that these guys now basically make films for our entertainment on a Sunday
Watched the video in 3x speed and i finished it. JJ's forehead grew big enough to take out mount everest
3 hour lol
JJ doesn’t even appreciate being on the good team he purposely doesn’t enjoy any of the activities
JJ is a bit much with his dramatics
Spending my birthday alone early morning in a cafe isn’t a bad way to spend the day🎉❤
52:53 - sums up Vikk.  No one likes him, he's a loser.
3h??? Let's goooo!!!!!
3 hours? thankyou almighty sidemen
3 hours? This is the stuff we like to see
2024 is the year of the sidemen
BANGER
Min 54:00 we cannot hear Josh’s voice 🙃
wtf a 3 hour video
The edit for the house of the good team🔥
This is actually movie quality Big up the editors.
The cinematic shots on top of the sky bridge at  2:14:07 is simply incredible and a poetic reflection of the journey the whole sidemen group have been on. Incredible!!!
Our Vik deserves better… he is one of the seven that has been in the worst team more times and they still don’t choose him…
43:00 he looked so happy ❤
This.This is cinema
Just me or is vikk and Behz never on the same team
Harry put his rocletta by the rock for latter...
why tf does ksi ALWAYS get the good team... really ruins the surprise
a 3hr vid is a bit ridiculous. I wonder how the retention is gonna be on this vid
JJ's face at 5:40 had me cracking
I just pray you guys good health so that we keep getting videos like these.
Lksi no way mans really treated him like that. Even Toby called it out
really felt bad for that group on the bus tbh. seemed like good dudes trying to have a nice ski trip
Poor vik is always singled out
1:53:59 ooooo
Nahhh that forehead cam for jj during the obstacle course task 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m dead !
Hang on I went to that resort in morzine. Penguin run 10/10
Yooooo this a banger 🔥
Tbjzl wassup i got a pic whith u in greenwich can u cme bck i wanna meet the other sidemen pls
FatNeek is back 😅 bros built diff he was like 80kg this October now he's back to a 100😂😂😂
Why the pool table censored
What a vid love the long vids cuz the are More funny stuff
Fat neek is back 😂
WOOO 3 HOUR SDM SUNDAYYY
Wow only the sidemen are doing it like this a 3 hour sidmen Sunday madness ❤
3hrs !!!!!!
honestly, their outfits are straight heat.
14:07 THE FACT THAT TOBI RESPONDED WITH, "Excuse me?" Is hilarious 😂😂😂🤣🤣
I had a little tear when no one picked vikk and he was such a sport. Harry was whining on day 1 so bad and vikk was trying to help. I feel for him😢
We, Sidemen fans, must make this video be the first 3 hour video to reach 100 mil views!
If “Sideman: The Movie” were to release for free to the public…this would be it
Gotta do one where everyone starts out horrible and they think they're the bad team but they meet up at same place and everyone just enjoys their time
I love that music is back on youtube!!! Also, hilarious that the songs in this video were all added to my playlist again recently
ethan and JJ had they mouth in that Ethan and JJ soup
Icl sidemen sundays are alway on top like never disappoint
No way harry just smelled the sock 😂
Oh boy this is going to be a long dinner for me
Harry and that cheese 😂
Top Job Chaps 🤘 Apart from being rather rude (entitled) on the coach 😬
How is the "bad team" a bad team?
bombaclat 3 hours is crazy dawg
5 minutes into the video and JJ already crying, shock
yooo a 3 hour sidemen video letsss gooo
Harry sniffing the sock at 1:16:20 is really the best way to some up his character in 1 image
3 HOUR VIDEO? W! LONGEST IN A WHILE!
Fatneek is back 😂
3 hours is mental, but i'm ready for it
Getting a 3 hour sidemen sunday is so cool
3 hour videos!!!! Sidemen is stepping up the game😂 The New 100mil view video for sure
Jj eats so good and trains that he dreams of this food
The ending was so wholesome, even the end credits
hee hee
1:16:19 why did harry smell her sock 😭
The sock on the snow boot 🤣
8:49 "we are not on the bad team we're on the cheap team"! i love tobi's positive vibes!
I saw two movies today with a combined time less than this it gotta be good
3h r u mad????
These long videos are the best ones fr
Simon Harry and Vik’s outfits are SO cool
A video with all 7 of them together would’ve been cool
JJ was violating in this video man💀💀
33:20- 33:32 it’s coz u black lol jk❤
1:24:40 the boys definitely send reels at midnight to each other
1:26:10 that's sleep apnea
Bros learned what micro aggression means and ran with it 😂😂
3 hours
1:16:19
come on man why seperate jj and ethan🤧🤧
JJ getting fat again
Harry actually sniffing the sock is wild 💀
Best zerka video of all time
Oh god the xenomorph is back 37:44
Need more vids this long
Why’d Harry sniff the sock
Why did they like to make a super long  video 😭
02:12:35 Coldplay hits different would want to visit the place
Memorable sidemen Sunday ❤
What if these are someone else's? Tough.
Why u smell that sock harry 😂😂😂
3 hrs wow
there’s no way JJ is expensive team again. he gotta be bribing josh at this point
The intro😍😍
I really want a butler video as it seems the team are all thinking about a butler video which would be a good idea.
jj seems boring AF irl lol which is unexpected
Wow a sidemen sunday were the bad team actually hated it. I know theyre eating then words when they said they like it
0:05
this made my day
Harry sniffing the sock yk 😂😂😂😭😭
This will span across 3 dinners, 3 days
Josh with another banger 🎉 well done 👏
Vik has been done so dirty in this video but his attitude is 💯
Poor from the cheap team just basically sacking off the list. What’s the point? Are all videos going to be like this now? Not very entertaining
They should do a Sunday were they all go on the same holiday together good or bad
Yay the same concept for the 1000th time 😐
Harry the sock sniffin bandit
WHY DID HARRY SMELL THE SOCK I CANNOT
Sidemen vidoes make my Sunday!!!👍👍👍👍👍
You'll never know why i got so many likes
8:05... guys...
BRO 3 HOURS??? ima get back from school so so happy
3 hours??? Oh man this is gonna be so GOOD
crazzyyy vid
1:14:24 to KSI s downfall xd
Well vikk is a gem 💎 ❤ ✨️
Simon done got enemies, hes getting sniped 36:36
Gotta give it editors for this 3 hour vid and what great content this is and Josh being a great host once again 🙌🏽👀.Josh shouldn’t be so underrated fr and the ideas he comes up with… WOW!! what a Sidemen vid this is and will be… 3 HOURSSSSSS!!!👀
Harry sniffing the sock is wild!
like if u think zerkaa should lead more often
tops best video now
The longer the video the better 🔥
THREE HOURS?!
1:16:20 why is harry smelling it like that???
Viks face just dropped when no one voted
3 hours is a bit to much
3 hours👀! Can't wait!!
The last thing left for Zosh is suck off Tobi..
a 3 hour Sidemen Sunday? What a treat!
Lovely to watch
Im sorry but JJ was too mean to those people on the bus
Yo that Jet Intro Scene was haaarrrdddd <3
feel sad for vik hes been in the bad team in so many videos now
Sidemen rock climbing would be dope
Tobi sounds like elmo lool 19:54 🤣
3 hours is crazy
Hollywood movies ❌ . Sidemen videos✔️
One of the best yet
My dad used to play the intro music to me when I was 2 years old. 😊
3 hour video I’m excited 💕
I wonder how many times I cringe at JJ in a video. Not a good thing.
JJ receiving Karma for his gloating made this. Although it’s peak that Vik got no votes. I’m glad Harry got to go though.
LUKAKUUUU!!!! 🍆
1:16:19 Nah ain't no way harry just smelt her used sock
Bro, not Harold smelling the bloody sock ☠ 1:16:19
JJ is always in the good team ffs
Lets gooo another holiday, I love these
KSI whines a lot and i'm not here for it. It's just annoying.
that snore was horrific 1:25:52 🤣🤣🤣🤣
3 hours😱
1:18:10  Grown men btw 😂😂😂😂😂
KSI behaving bare obnoxious in this one.  10 minutes in:  - I’m too rich for this - Mocks the trip in front of people who’ve paid for it - Calls them NPCs because they don’t agree
1:40:18 that sideeye 😂
JJ actually cheesed me in this video
1:25:35 What a nice guy
Barely an hour deep and can’t stop laughing 10/10 👍🏻 well done. Proper W
Finally a vid where they dont ruin the whole thing by showing "highlights" of what happens later on... Best vid yet imo
Apart from them (mainly Josh) pressuring Harry to drink when he’s trying to better his life. This was a sick vid
1:16:19 ain't no way harry sniffed it  😭
Best Sidemen vid ever. 10/10
I would love a humble KSI video he’d have so many fits😂😂
What was that lazer on Harry vick and Simon
The Fat Neek has returned
icl 3 hour sidmen sunday is unmatched
No one gonna mention Harry sniffing the sock? 😂😂😂
Ethan Farting in that cable cart is such a DAD thing to do. 😂
now this is the sidemen movie we were promised!
The NPC comments by JJ were out of pocket. That's gross
3 hours, we watching interstellar or smt?
Another proof that the sidemen don't root for Vikk.. seriously as a Vikk fan, this is getting real now. So sad honestly
LMAO I love when Josh said “it’s givinggg”.
The Bad team always always have the best experience in the end I personally think✌️
so i think jj just learned the word microaggression lmaooo
3 hour video?! Haven’t even started yet and know it’s going to be epic!!
Swear ksi always gets the good team 😂
3hrs is gonna take me a week to watch but I’m here for it
Why do all the people in that country have the same hair style, wtf is going on
Poor vik man I actually think they don’t like him I’m not even joking
Making JJ switch teams was DIABOLICAL!!!!
I always love when sidemen post
35:41 39:50 43:37 1:08:09 42:26 2:58:17
The editors didn’t have to go this hard, awesome video!!
1:21:24
The 3 Nigerians😂
why is it vik always in bad team ??
1:17:00 too funny 😂
The up down up of them not knowing if they have to do the huge list of tasks was so funny
i never thought, when i saw the first ever sidemen gta video ,that I'd see harry get offered a joint for a wheel of cheese
Anyone got the statistic on how many times every sidemen has been on the hood team? Cause I’m sure the stats are fckd and I blame Josh
40 mims in and it's up there with the best types of these vids they've ever done
Nahh bruv , harrys been geeking with that girl socks
1:07:39 bro was the biggest npc 😭😭😂
30:50 🤣viks face when he says about the jumping transition 🤣
im so glad harrys on the cheap team.
W
Yesss i have been waiting for a vid like this 🎉🎉🎉🎉
simon vik and harry are such a good group man.
preparing myself for these three hours
3 hours of Fun!!!
36:38 I thought Simon had a sniper on his head for like a split second😂
nah jj gotta calm down his ego fr bros just making fun of bro for asking a picture
Why does JJ always get the good ones
The 200 v 20,000 and the holiday challenges are literally the sickest episodes. Three hours aswell!!
Anyone noticed Harry smelling the sock at 1:16:19
I ain’t watching alltha
I wish that vik forever in the cheap team
yo like this comment to support chip fat for the W EDITING
Ksi so out of touch with people
1:16:12 Harry smells woman’s sock
3hrs??????
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ksi 10/10 performance this vid
2:50:00 very funny 😂
3 HOURS!?! Such a treat🤩
A 3 hour video is insane, I like it 😂. Love the fact people still haven’t finished the video at the time of me commenting this.
Harry sniffing the sock at 1:16:15 🤣
Brudda just spoilt the vid in the thumbnail after catching up in the video😭😭😭😭
1:48:40 that looks so funny
3hours HOLLYYY
Tobi walking down the stairs was coldddd
Jj goes from build to fat in seconds
God bless 3 hours sidemen video
Sidemen are the best group on YouTube 👇
*KSI STANDS FOR KRYPTO SCAMMING IDIOT*
JJ is so cringe in this video, what is bro saying, blud is 30
8:55 its sad man jj was really rude
47:36 Nah Simon is too witty
What r u guys doing to my sleep man
30 mins into a 3 hr video and harry says he cba 😂
Feeling sorry for vik damn
51:24 harry was having a mental breakdown with that cynical psychopathic laugh lol.
Anyone else peeped that Harry sniffed the ladies sock
Ksi doesn't deserve the good team
The pool looks like the sidemen house
guess it’s still winter in Europe. it’s hot as hell in Southern America.
This is gonna be an actual banger
Casper is so Iconic
damn 3 hours
The fact this is just more then one day is a banger x
This is better than 99.99% of movies this year...   The vlog boys are back aswell  2024 is the year 💯
Have to watch this in 2x speed who has the attention span to watch for 3 hours😂
8-12:45 ksi shut up man
3 hours of content is absurd
editors better have been PAID for this... 3 hours is nuts
This edit is fire 🔥
Finally I can sleep 😂
I’d like to see KSI in one of South Africa’s Taxi 🫡
Damn 3 hours for a sidemen video this will be one that we remember
Remembering jj is lactose intolerant and realising I'd do the exact same if I saw all that cheese(I'm also lactose intolerant😂)
Camera man is smart guy, left tobi alone for the facial The TobRizzer strikes 😂
At 1:04:50 the guy looks like he goes to punch simon
so JJ Fatneek is back? xD
No way they think they look fresh for dressing like overweight crayons
1:26:12 Harry was petrified 😂
JJ : what are we sucking  😂😂😂😂😂
3 hours of Sidemen Sunday!!!...i'm excited
inflation got the sidemen too, from 10k to 20k
Well this is going to be a long dinner....
Kind of like Survivor.
This is becoming stupid KSI on the good team again
3 HOURS!!!! SAY WHAT
Cold
another 3hr side sunday?? holy shxxt👀👀
Around 36 mins nice to see the swat team are in the bushes
1:24:51  Harry: Give them a kiss good night vik go on Vik: *blows kiss* Harry: ah that was abit weird 😂😂😂
1:16:20 brooo Harry casually smelling the sock 😂
KSI IS AFRAID OF POOR PEOPLE 😢
Bruh why this vid so long 😭
I can just imagine those travelers on airports etc having their 2 weeks a year vacation, and KSI is there like:»Nooooo Ueeeh Nooo im to rich for this» 😂😂
Harry and his cheese 🥹
Guaranteed JJ is on good team and Harry is on the bad team haha
KSI for got he was famous when that guy asked him for a picture 😂😂😂😂😂
JJ on a  bus with random people made me laugh so much 😂😂😂
1:56:30 VaJJ 😂😂
Harry smelling the sock 🤣
bro tobi flipping on his face aha
Casper was really unfunny. Almost killed the bad team segment for me.
JJ really doesn’t vibe with actual people at this point
3 hours? THREE HOURS????
Yt be lying saying fewer ads bro ive had about 34 and only watched 47mins of it 💀
ABSOLUTE BANGER !!!! Big up Sidemen and Josh 🔥🔥🔥🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽👏🏽🙏🏼
The part until they know if they are on the good or the bad team is always so much fun!
1:33:15 Simon not saying anything is hilarious😂
3 hour lets goo
1:49:56
KSI's brattyness is getting annoying now
Ethan and KSI laughing at and being rude to that bloke on the bus was absolutely uncalled for, their egos are out of control and they have absolutely no one to tell them.
Bro ethan and JJ laughing at that guy for being an NPC shouldnt have been that funny.
sick editing
Okay... Can we talk about how smooth the Side+ add was?? Perfectly implemented 🤝
24:26 Ethan does Faith's smile XD
3HRS WTFFFF
The boys out here giving us moviessssss let’s go WW
1:44:00 HOLY SH
sidemen holidays are the best types of videos they make
3 hours is crazy
42:05 The way Ethan was looking at that thing is crazy 😭😭
Vikk doing his intro was so funny 😂
I am giddy just looking at the length.
3 hour video yeah I’m watching this on my flight 😭
What ever team ksi in that is the bad one 😂
Fkn goats
1:43:04 okie dokie
3 hours video absolute class love yall man❤
So happy we got a full 3hrs!
3 hours video? yeah that's gonna be the longest dinner i've ever had in my life
The NPC's are complaining
Ethan definitely said that😂
Even if the video was 6+ Hrs its still not enough for me
The goats 😂❤
Gon be elite
3 hours. Legendary entertainment while at work fixing phones all day
3 hours…. W in the chaaaattt 😂
This is a literal movie
this is amazing
Man I hope it's a switch. Vids are better when jj is miserable
They have the best snow there 😂😂😂😂
JJ's comment about the guys phone, and taunting them before getting in the van was unironically rude and disrespectful. A joke's a joke but that was a bit much
If I went on the expensive holiday and I got meat, lettuce and potatoes for my meal I would go mental. The pizza was better
why did harry smell the sock 💀1:16:18
Harry: Give em a kiss goodnight Vik  Vik: Gives a kiss goodnight  Harry: alright that was a bit weird Vik
1:24:51 vik :- flying kiss               Harry :- that was bit weird
3 f hour..... Let's gooooooooooooooooo
isnt it amazing how far this channel has come from painting faces lol
how Vik and Harry always in the bad team??
Harry's face at 49:15 is so funny too
Sidemen we’re in Geneva🥲 whene i left they came😢
Vik is the goat
WHY DID HARRY SNIFF THE SOCK 😂💀
the face cam at 1:00:00 is killing me💀💀
What happened to jj's physique
there all NPCS was a violation
A 3 hour Sidemen Sunday!!!!   Wow, can't wait to watch this.
Why’d Harry smell the sock
3 hours 💆
im so happy that vik, Simon and Harry got to vote JJ out its peak
The way Ethan turnt his head after migros😂😂😂😂😂
Just got my wisdom teeth out, so yay 3 hour long sidemen video so i can rest😂
Who does ksi think he is ? “IM TOO RICH FOR THIS” “This NPC wants a pictures” then laughs at his face . Literally disrespectful ash . Show decency to another human being .
Harry's childish hoodie is fire
Great video so far but the amount of ads on it is actually ridiculous
"they already nerfed hes speech why would they nerfbhes willy" ffs😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
1:46:17
To bad JJ is in the video. I bet he is a nice man but when the camera is on he is not real, seems forced.
Lmao welcome to MTVs cribs
ethan x ksi😍😍😍
Damn, this is a long video!  Excited, but gonna probably have to break it up into multiple days😂
Omg a 3hr Sidemen video?? Am I dreaming?
42:58 😂😂😂😂
It's nice that the crew get to enjoy the good time as well
Fatneek is back😂
Can I just say that intro with the PJ animation is class
idk why but the filters on the video look insane it gives off a vintage snow holiday vibe the production of these videos is the best i’ve seen
Harry legit smelled that women's sock btw 😂
3 hours boys my Mrs is screwing at me, I've got a make it up to her tomorrow
The bad teams Holiday is sometimes better / more enjoyable
Yo?!?! 3 HOURS??? 🔥🔥🔥
600 000 views in an hour
I mean 3 hours is cool and all but i think 1 hours is the perfect length for a video
Fatneek is coming back
They actually did JJ with dirty that camera angle😂😂
We need vikk on the good team  Feeling sad for him now 😞
Why did Harry smell the socks😂
Before ik the teams (good or bad) im conflicted cause i want Ethan to have a good time but jj have a bad one
is this the official longest sidemen sunday
the transition to the ad and back was so sick
harry swaps the cheese for a sock, proceeds to sniff sock
3 hours is mental
3 hr video, a welcome surprise to end my Sunday
whos keith
1:00:16 IM DEAD 😭
Their poor editors 😭. The videos just get longer every week
Yooooo Fatneek is back😂😂😂
3hr SIDEMEN SUNDAY IS CRAZZZZZY !!!!
1:01:37 xD
1:38:37 i love harry
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Side plus ad was FIRE
This took me 45 minutes till I realised it was 3 hours long. So gassed
Production up!
THIS EDITING LOOKS COLD🥶
32:15 😂😂😂😂
Actually Vik,Harry, Josh & Simon....they had fun 😂😂
Since when was me I chubby and looks like a hamsta
1:08:09 KSI has reverted back to whale
"bad team" lol. I cant even afford to leave my country
38:13 😂😂😂😂
1:16:20 oh no Harry got caught 😂
3hours gowan josh
KSI just different when he has benefits
ksi is too rich
Editor was cooking on this one
When I click on the video but have to realize its 3 hours long 💀🔥
The snow didn’t taste nice 😭😭😭
josh cooked as host 🔥
it was a good vid until Simon started hating on Josh and brough the mood down Were not watching because of youre in it Simon, stop acting like a little clown
Why did Harry smell the sock!!!!!
So Ethan's dyed his hair and now hes dying his beard more orange im dead😂😂
39:46 😂😂😂
Imagine giving 2 of the most undeserved, smug human beings the good team spots, they need humbling
bro this is as long as avengers endgame this is cold
3 hours!!!
bro why does JJ always whine about everything
Harry been looking hella fine recently 😫
YALL WERE IN MY TOWN AND I DIDNT EVEN KNOW?!?!?!
is it the return of the fatneek or is JJ just bulkin?
I’m here for Harry’s cheese. 🧀
Ethan’s neck twitch before that joke shows Harry isn’t the only one with autism 1:18:24
love that Randy, lux and freezy show up
Hahahaha JJ getting karma for what he did is the funniest thing about the video!
The editing on this video is 🔥
1:14:48 for the cursed image
What’s better The Marvel Universe or The Sidemen Universe? This rivals most of their films 😅
I sometimes drink spicy water to get less hungover the day after
1:04:50 what a 🔔 🔚
The next 100M views
3 hours?? That’s mad 😂
Can’t believe KSI is fat already. 😂
lol 😂😂😂😂
The fit of the bad team looked way better than good team lol🤣
I thought no more fatski...
Could’ve been a series but instead it’s a movie 🔥
Gonna have to watch this over several days 😅
Just put Harry and JJ on the same team once
honestly the more time goes on the less i like JJ, dude is just rude at this point and not even funny anymore.
Swear JJ is never on the bad team? Why?
First half is a banger and the second half was even better
18:11 Big up Josh  Excellent Camera work 💪 W Production Sidemen are really pushing hard guys!!!❤
Ksi is not funny he is extra cringe sometimes
Zerkaaaaa🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just finished watching other sidemen holiday videos and this one showed up  Perfect timing to add another one to the list
Vik was genuinely angry
ethan breaking the fourth wall🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
Bruh jj on the bus was a menace
Ethan is whiter than usual lately. Don't know how to explain it
JJ being surprised by rich people things will always be entertaining
use me as a no spoiler
3hr SDMN sunday... now we talkingggg
Ksi, Ethan and Tobi are so boring at the good team. Harry and Vikkstar are great and carrying the video. Please stop all this moaning about being to rich and to spoiled. Otherwise an intertaining video and super great editing.
1:32:29 Harry is so cute
no way harry smelled a random womans sock💀
Jj try not to ruin the video challenge: impossible
3 hours?!!! LETS GOO
3 hr sidemen Sunday bout have a nice long chill

The editing was fire
Is Vikk a sicko?
W
Great video
3 hours lets go
best vid in a while
1:03:51 Respect for Tobi unlocked by JJ, Ethan, and everyone watching
1:23:59 America here, could someone give me a run down on UK football teams?
3 hours!!!! LFG
why is it every single time jj and tobi gets the good team like every single one of these videos.  i honestly don’t like watching the good team anymore because it’s jj and tobi doing the same thing over and over again.  and even if jj gets on the bad team he complains 24/7 and its so annoying.
Another L for Vik
30:53
39:30 Nahhhh. Vik movin' wild. 💀
Ethan :Bye migros , jj and tobi:🤨
THATS SOOO SICKKKKKKKK
harry sniffing the sock is wild
Nah there’s levels to these intros and this was top 🔥🔥🔥
Harry walking around with Cheese is comedy
1:46
the editing on this video is fantastic. shout out to the editors good god but missed opportunity bringing the bad team boys to the good team. content would have been way better
W0OOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
Nah KSI is so spoiled bro
1:16:16 harry sniffing it😮😮😮😂
1:06:05 with friends like these, who needs enemies? 🤣
JJ during the obstacle course, the camera angle is so funny
hi
No lie KSI slowly turning back to being Fatneek again 😮
Wouldn’t mind if there wasn’t adds every 30 seconds
Its crazy that im here after a hour, and litterally nobody could have watched the whole video 😂
Randys Comedy Set it GOLD!

54:40 audio issue or just me?
Harry sniffing the woman's sock 😂😂😂

1:16:17 why'd harry sniff the sock
3 HOURS this must be a banger vid
1:24:40
JJ eating maccies :(
If they were smart. They could've broken this down to 3 episodes and had 3 weeks off. Just saying
harry saying to tobi ill take that is crazy.
Your man outside the bar nearly broke Simon’s hand with that fist bump 😂😂
JJ and Ethan doing faces underwater is a vibe
by the time i commented, nobody has finished this video yet hahahah
Wow 3h?! I'm definitely not finishing this in one sitting!
1:25:23 its so well made, sidemen are so clear of everyone
14:04 😂😂😂😂
joshua let me braid  your ankle hairs
Lol
1:08:24 KSI is actually fat again let’s go
The good team is the among us team lol
Vik deserves a great trip, especially after last week.
I'm so glad Josh joined the cheap team at the bar. Really brought the vibes up.

First ever 3 hour sidemen video and sunday gonna be so good

Simon killed me with the harry joke
1:16:18 why did he smell it 😭
3:10 3 minutes in and harry already has me rolling 😂😂
49:10 is one of my fave clips of the video - poor harry hahaha
the 1:00:00 time stamp view is hilarious😂😂😂😂
Why does JJ at  33:45 look like a guy in a boy band that's in his 30😅😂😂
Only channel where 3hr videos would be good and considered GOLD
35:20 jjs smile is so adorable
harry smelling the sock @ 1:16:20  killed me
why did harry smell the sock😭1:16:19
47:38 Simon savage mode😂😂😂😂
14:04😂😂
3 hours is crazy 😧
Crazy that Ethan's been on the good team everytime he started complaining about it... hmm...
32:19 the cheap teams outfits are cold 🥶
Calling normal people living there normal lives NPC's is mad disrespectful...🤭🫣
Who else but the Sidemen could pull off making videos this long that people actually want to watch? Absolutely brilliant.
RIDDLED in ads
Shock JJ's six packs are gone so Harry is no longer the sidemen's fatneek 😂😂😂
Harry sniffing the sock is WILD

This is soo good😂😂
1:14:51 KSI be looking like a Blobfish xD
Honestly it hooked me from the start… W @Zerkaa
The energy in the first couple minutes especially with jj was great, definitely one of the better sidemen Sundays!
38:22 "bro bit lip for a lettuce" i wheezed for a good minute
Going to be the best 3 hours of my life
KSI is getting fat
1:22:10 what a shot
A fcking movie
I love when JJ starts his meltdowns & screams sooo dramatic 😂😁
58:43 Ethan's transition is W
Amazing video ❤loved it

Is this another holiday video?
Not long enough. Should've done better
at 47:45 when they realise they had done the tasks on accident after roasting Josh was perfect and then realising they had to do the tasks again had me dying
W Cameraman!!!
Sidemen starting to show how they're not as humble as they have seemed in the past... Getting bored of getting videos about how they have little money and complain about it for over an hour, not a good watch :/
Love a good sidmen Sunday
3 hours is crazy
The tobi nose grind is mad
JJ Celebrating his car swap like Arsenal won the league got me creasing
1:14:22 to ksi's downfall lmao
The Nigerian team goes crazy

Ethan’s laugh at 31:26 sounds just like eating food on Minecraft 😂
Harry having a rollercoaster of emotions was so funny
40:25  come on boy😂😂😂😂

When I saw 3 HRS I thought they are not even Life Streaming a game LOL Jesus Christ.

wht is the good teams air bnb called and where is it
2:44 John being the curse bearer is killing me
Harry speaks my language................. Edit: am still waiting for josh swap in my life🥲
naw does simon ever get on the good team
I swear, KSI never takes a chill pill. it's just constant screaming.
Ja tak danmark nævnt i medierne!!!!
NPC asking for a picture had me CRYING lmaooo ethan laugh was making it worse fr
The gta run and jump😂
Jj on the bus was cringing me out too badly, felt bad for the ppl who were acc there for a gd time. Get it’s for the content tho obvs
Vik got violated at rock paper siz
Anyone watching this in one go is a demon 😊
LETS GOOOOO
can't believe i've been watching for three hours
3 hours😳
No one has finished the video at the time of writing this
Harry should keep drinking
Anyone reading this comment within an hour hasn’t finished this vid
funny thing is i've been to verbier (where they were) for so many years and its almost weird seeing them at the pubs i went to and skied at
An add every 5 minutes...really?
3 hour viddo banger this a movie
jj can't make friends...
1:08:49 💀💀💀
petition to get Vik on the good team👇
3 hours taking the piss lads
Any video with both jj and Ethan on the good team is garbage, watching them gloat disgusts me
Ksi forehead cam is GOLD lol
I love this 3hour holiday video
Yes! Yes! Yes! We love to see it
1:07:45 omg Ksi has been living well since his tommy fight
1:16:20 didd harry just smell the sock 💀💀💀☠☠
I want to know how drunk that guy was to not play rock paper scissors but bloody knuckles
wow!! this might be their best one this year
Here we go .....hahahahaa this is gonna be awesome The production is INSANE...wow  "Simon Minter, he's bottled the top"😂😂😂😂
KSI on the expensive team? of course he is...
Endgame level production could this be the big shoot Josh was talking about last week
Vik’s split or steal karma is catching up in bad teams 😅
W vid over 1 hour
JJ definitely got a PJ 😂
That German guy the best 😅😅😅
After how jj acted to bad team, it makes me happy knowing jj got Rko’d and that it acc hurt 😂😂😂
Knew it was going to be long but 3 hours damn!!!!!
I can already tell this is the banger
3 hr 😮
1:02:55 nah toby 's yes is killing me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sidemen at it again to save the sunday
55:05 there is a sound problem.. cant hear josh 😢
9:20 jj is actually hella disrespectful
The edit of fat JJ killed me great video lads 😂❤
Did them absolutely filthy😂😂😂
Longer than 2 hours everyone is going to enjoy this
3 hrs, damn
3 HOURS, what a sidemen Sunday
The bad team had wayyy cooler outfits, they’re proper groovy
This going to be one long memorable dinner
1:03:59 Harry and Josh
1:16:49 bro really flipped off Vik 💀
already watched the whole thing rlly good vid
1:06:12 I'm wondering rn if they're all gonna switch teams the next day. Not totally attached to this theory though.
Fat NEEK gang where u at
Holy 3 hours long
Why do JJ look like Ariel from the live action movie 🐠
This is  sick video
09:27 i need to see that selfie 😂😂
nice add
Literally dropped a whole movie 3 hours is crazy! And I'm here for it
Bro Vik went crazy with this plotting lmao 52:44
I felt so bad for the dudes on the bus man, especially the guy asking for a pic
I must say that JJ was mad disrespectful with the other people on the bus in the beginning. Like not everyone can fly around with private jets to wherever. Those people are happy to be there and I think its not cool to get on that bus and start screaming that oh this is cheap and bad and call those people NPCs.
Tired of these kinds of videos ngl.
Gettin bored to jj good team every time to predictable men
37:30 them sitting in an Oreo is crazy😭
Doesn't matter where Harry is or what he's doing  All he thinks about is plane crashes😂
Putting a forehead came on KSI 😂
Simon ily 1:02:12
3 hours what I’m new to the sidemen this is mental
Amazing vid. The end was amazing!!
WHEN WILL WE GET SIDEMEN $100000 VS $100 DIVORCE
3 hours? That’s a Bollywood movie fam😂
That blue team house is the sickest house i have ever seen!
Love the editing
This is the closest a sidemen Sunday has come to WillNe levels of storytelling
JOHN THE OBSESSED GIRLFRIEND HAHAHAHAH
10:45 10:53 24:44 27:00 41:11 48:52 50:00 54:30 1:05:38 1:05:45 1:10:42 1:12:35 1:15:39 1:22:12 1:24:22 1:24:52
gonna be a long dinner
The return of the fatneek
viks ideas😂
how is jj not good on the monkey bars,
Here we go!!!
3 bloody hours 😅
33:15 NO I LOVE THESE TRANSITIONS
WHAT A SOLID VIDEO 🔥🔥🔥
47:53 damnnnn that's mean
40:28 bro that catch from jj😮
This place is so cool for skiing, was there this year. So much fun 😊😊
This gonna be a long lunch
12:14 is the most golden retriever type smile harry's ever had
The edits in this video are pure fire
This video was awesome 😂(I ain’t watch it yet)
They should do one of these videos, where both teams are on the bad team, but neither know. Dont allow phone calls or facetime
jj's attitude was not it, no offense but it's a little uncomfortable watching a multi-millionaire complain about a trip that is still VERY unattainable for 80% of the UK population (and before people come at me yes i know that he's playing it up for the camera, doesn't mean the joke is funny)
Where in Denmark has Harry had bad experience?? Why he hates it personally?
when u see a 3hr sdmn sunday yk its a banger
1:18:25. IM DEAD
That intro is cold lmao pun intended but to my point of this comment, sidemen should actually get a jet because of the amount that they travel, thoughts?
IK where 3 hours of my 24 hours are going.
3 hours vid omg
Every like I get I have to do 1 pushup
3 hours!!!!!!!!! they have gone balls out on this ...
3 hours? Are we sure this isn’t the behind the scenes 😳
I don’t like how they always show the teams in the thumbnail. It should be suspense for the viewer leading up to see who’s in the good and bad teams.
35:41 😂
I just click the video and saw 3 hours I knew I was in for a banger 🔥🔥
14:03 Ethan: “Byeeee…Bye Migros” 😂
IYKYK Calfreezy crying now 😂
Hot take Harry vik and Simon’s outfits are better
24:29 I really thought we were getting "helicopter helicopter" right there 😂
Jj being weird af on the coach
That ad transition was slick af🔥
3 hrs yeh! Let’s go lads 😅
4:30 bro really said "normal people"
Seeing KSI, Ethan, and Tobi getting the good team and seeing Harry slowly realizing they’re are in the bad team and got double bluffed was the funniest part😂😂
59:16 Harry is actually having a mental breakdown the entire time
People saying they’ve watched it already , yet it was posted 1 hour again and is a 3 hour video 😂
3hr sidemen sunday = banger vid
JJ laughing in a guy's face calling him an NPC was uncalled for.
2:01 "I knew the Nigerians would be together today" 😂😂
Ksi don’t deserve the good team
1:00:00 😭😭😭
BANGERRRRR
Is KSI not lactose intolerant?
glad to see vik
Best sidemen video yet😊
ngl vik looks like a mini rishi sunak lmao
LMAOOOO
intro music i enjoyed it alot
Why did Harry smell the sock 😭😭😭
A 3 Hour Sidemen video…something tells me it’s gonna be a long day😅
58:41 thats cute of josh
this is literally a feature length film
Let's go, lads. Good start to the morning
Nit even kidding but the cheap team always has the best time and the most interesting footage ...
Petition to change the title to the sidemen movie ?
Vikk got off lucky with the ski costumes
I see why upload took a minute 🙌🏽
36:19 thought Simon was about to be sniped 😂
Its spring
Josh always swaps Vik and Tobi 😂
3 HOURS VIDEO?? I'M IN.
3 hrs🤯🤯🤯
Fasting for Ramadan and everything in this video looked delicious 😵‍💫 expect the pork
Broooooooooo i really wanted the red team to be the bad one.
Vikk needs a good holiday
43:18 are there making a food vlog or a food p*rn🤣
Feel bad for vik they don’t value him as a real friend outside of these videos 😂😂😂
We eating good today First the manutd win and a 3hr sidemen Sunday W❤
Love the extra long video, the slower pace was great as was the extra footage just to see more of the boys being boys, the option to watch in 2/3 parts being there is great aswell more of this please
This is the Sidemen Sunday's I remember.. Josh always with a banger
Josh is the king of these. The logistics for this are nuts
next time have them choose a colour! let fate be in their hands and they only have themselves to blame
Tobi looks like krillz
55:14 damn yellow eyes
bodyguard coming in straight away 1:04:56
The production quality is actually becoming insane
The dark skin duo is always the expensive team 😂😂
anyone kinda prefer it when jj is on the bad team
3 hours is crazy! Blessed day
55:05 i never thought i would hear that Harry doesn't want to drink
Calling normal people living there normal lives NPC's is mad disrespectful...🤭🫣
Great vid ,andi mean the bad team aint truly bad but obviously its not the good team lol
No wayyy another holidays, let's goooo
JJ been on the bad team consistently lately  Glad to see him and Tobi on the good team together again Josh does the best Sundays
Remember "money doesnt bring happiness" - simon
3 hours what the F
I loved the ending😂😂
This is the beggining of an end of Sidemen. Many people arent gonna watch 3 hour long video, and when theyll se that they dont miss it, the viewer count will go down week by week
6:28 “what are we sucking” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The reason there the most views Simone is cuz there the best lol granted your in 2nd
TIGA JAM😭😭🤍
don't know if I'm being overly sensitive but seeing the boys laugh at less fortunate people while calling them NPCs was just very weird
3 hour sidemen Sunday I can't wait to watch this all night
fatneek is back
56:49 Harry is just not having it anymore
3 hr vid is so fire
JJ looks so much better with his hair down
YESSSS NEW VIDEO
3 hours is insane. This vid is defo gonna bang.
The Funniest thing for one of these videos would be to let both teams go to the good spot have them both on the good team but make them think like they are on the bad team leading up to it.
Absolutely banger, poor Vik, harry and Simon 😅😂, well done Ethan, JJ and Toby 😎
I think they should do a video like this make each team think they are on the bad team, and then they are all at some banger of a place??!
These guys are the best, 35yrs old and stilllll enjoying their uploads ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
If anyone else has the speechify ad its absolutely 🔥🔥🔥🔥
This video is gonna go down history 🤫🤫
The fact this is 3h long is insane and i LOVE IT
harry at 49:25 is so me
happy to see vik well and good
1:16:13  Harry smelling the sock 💀💀😂
It’s like a movie!
Brother euuuuuh !!
52:51 i like Vik's idea
The bad team looked like a bunch of COD gun camos
3 hours lovely jubbly. Cali pack and sidemen perfect Sunday night
It would've been perfect if Josh put JJ and Ethan back on that coach when they were celebrating like that 😭
PROBABLY BEST 3h of my LIFE
40:25 come on boy 👨🏻‍🦳
damn 3 hours wtf😭
33:19 i wonder why?????
Im on 43:09 and I've just noticed this is a 3 hour video
Am i the only one surprised that jj knows what a micro aggression is?
I love ur videos but 3 hours is a little too long.
For ones please put jj on the bad team. Seeing a billionaire being on expensive holidays was fun the first few times but now its so boring
At the time of me posting this comment. No one can have seen the entire video through. Cool fact right???
The production on the video is crazy.
Hear me out, a holiday video...$100,000 vs $1,000 but it's the events and not the location. So the $100,000 people get like a hostel but all of a sudden they get to go like swimming with sharks, or get into a private practice for a futbol team. While the others get...just a nice place and that's it, no other things to help bide the time.
WOOOOOOOOOOOO
5:27 ‘ brother said hustle’ I’m dead 😂😂😂
bro next time jj and tobi bad team guaranteed please :))
I feel like JJ was disrespectful towards the other passengers. Downgrading their experience that they probably were excited for.
3hrs??!! This is gonna be a treat for the ages!! 🎉
This is why JOSH ZERKA is goated!!!!
Shout out to Beta Squad for the guess who real life edition💯💯
excited for this 3 hour video but about to suffer for the BTS
Nah but JJ calling the guys on a normal Christmas trip NPC's just proves how much he's out of the normal world😂
Why do JJ remind me of Franklin from GTA 5 lol love the vids they make me laugh when JJ goes in a strop lol
32:43 Vik is just a lil guy 🥹 💀
what
24:01 the siderangers
Vik, harry, and Simon trio is goated
40:25 in, and Behz already has 3 sus moments 😂😂
Imagine 10 years ago doing the cross bar challenge in some school playground Harry would be moaning about a few challenges and a bar crawl for a video
3 hours??? Will take me until next sunday
3 hour video is crazyyyyyy
H2O is 3 atoms JJ lmao
we all know harry took a fat swig out of that bottle at 6:50 when there in the car
3 Hours😯
More than anyone else, Josh tricked the audience into thinking Vikstar is finally in the good team. 😮😂
52:57 acc feel so bad for harry 🤣😭
As a guy born in 2004 whose dad used to play fatboy slim a lot in my childhood, it was very nostalgic hearing the intro song outta nowhere
i like how jj just doesnt care about people and just screams
Time to spend the next 3 hours well 😊
3H? HARD TO WATCH 1H LET ALONE 3H
14:02 the face of realization 😭
3 hour thanks boys
Someone has to humble KSI.
Yo 460k views in less then an hour wtf amazing😮😮😮
I love the start of these videos when both teams think they are on the bad team.
Look at the phone hes got? bro that's more expensive than the best iphone lmao
50:17 Harry is dead
Trying to 🤔😉🤣
Oreo
JJ is actually so ungratefull cl
KSI is a public embarrassment
JJ doesn’t deserve the good team, he is always ungrateful either way
this is gonna be 3 hours long sahoor
🎉🎉🎉🎉
50:02 harry💀
Best sidemen Sunday ever?
It would be more enter😢if jj and ethan were on the cheep team
Harry paired up with Simon and Vik- thats just sad!
This video is so dope from the intro to the end great job
Wooo 3 hours
2:34:20 Vic and Simon are so done lmaooo
WOOW...3 hours, that's like one Bollywood movie... I'm afraid if the others got that attention span, but what a treat this is...
Jj is getting fat
They really donnot like vik poor vik😢😢😢😢😢😢
How am I early
Tbh, I think the Sidemen will end if all of them will be “tired/don’t care and can’t be asked” as Harry or JJ because they have the money now.
Thankyou for a 3hour movie this sunday...not watched it yet but this is perfect as im about to get ready to chill for the night 👌👏💪💯
49:42 its so well recorded and Harry looks so good
I feel that jj doesn’t even enjoy the good team. He just much more funnier to see in the bad team cause we can laugh at his moaning. But I accept the 3 hour vid❤
credits at the end is crazyyy
Great. With how my schedule is, this is going to take 2 weeks for me to complete 😂
3 hour video 😍
YES YES YES , good team vs bad team vids are goated ‼️🐐
JJ calling other people in bus NPCs... Worst guy ever.
35:40 pure comedy
These are my favourite types of videos ❤
How have so many people watched this already 😂😂
No wonder it was posted late, its 3hrs long!!!🎉
This will be the most viewed sidemen video come the end of the year
Look it's the month of Ramadan what's a better way than coming back from taraweeh reading quran then watch 3 hours of sidemen Sunday
49:12 and hes suicidal again
Can Simon stop being so pessimistic all the time? It’s so fking annoying
This is what i needed in my life. 3HOURS AND A WINTER HOLIDAY 😍
Love your videos colab with the boys and beta squad ❤❤❤❤
WE NEED A SIDEMEN BOOTCAMP THAT WOULD BE FIRE🔥🙏🏿

The rollercoaster of emotions are very entertaining :)

Vik‘s intrusive thoughts are everything
3 HOURS?????!!!!!
Time to tuck in with a box of popcorn... its movie time
53:01 is sooo awkward
Ive had breakfast, now about to fold two baskets of laundry with 2 hours 20 minutes left to watch🙌🏾 I love Sidemen Mondays (I’m in NewZealand)

30:54 Simon, Vik, and Harry looking like Fall Guys characters🤣🤣🤣
14:03 ayoooo Ethan?
40:52 awwww
3 hours??? The poor editors hahahah
Something tells me this’ll bang I’ve not even watched it yet 😅
40:26 Ethan : Come on boy 😂😂💀💀
Ksi being rude AF at the start icl
“why is this NPC asking for a picture?” I’m being serious😑🤖🤖 had me on the floor😂😂
Sometimes JJ is so disrespectful and out of touch with "random" people 😅 the way he talks about the trip and the other guys in the bus, while they are probably stoked for a holiday they have saved up for.
3h waaaaathefuck
Ah yes....time to watch Dune 2 a second time
KSI in good team again, getting bored of this
😱 how long is this video
Probably other people watching their Ramdan series now and am here for this banger,and its 3 hours
38:14 lol 39:49 40:18 42:14 43:14 52:50 53:49 56:53 climbing 1:10:21 1:14:37 1:17:59 1:25:53 1:29:16 1:38:29 1:41:26 1:43:57 mountain 1:45:47 1:47:16 harry joke 1:48:39 1:52:17 lol 1:56:43 1:59:10 2:06:33 2:16:40 lol 2:17:49 2:18:11 lol 2:21:30
34:30 WROETOSTAR >>> Vikk trapped him there
I swear tobis always on the good team
3 hours🔥🔥
i have to get a colonoscopy tomorrow ,i dont have time for thiss 😢
KSI is so rude for no reason, fans simply asking for photos and he’s laughing at them, the man needs humbling especially with that hairline
3hours!?!? Ffs. They really don’t understand that it should be quality not quantity
Harry’s fit is actually fire
This video is a banger😂😂
3...HOURS?!!!
Need to get my popcorn. This is titanic long
Ethan wiping while sledding at like 28 min and giggling sounds like elmo😂😂
211
Put KSI on the bad team ffs, don't give me that "it's randomised" crap, he always has a tantrum when he's put on the bad team so now Josh has just given into it and always puts him on the good team and it's frustrating as hell, humble this tory tosser put him on the bad team
36:25 a sniper is trying to headshot simon !
3 hours wtf
39:35 😂
Tobi keeps getting blessed
30 mins in, JOSH COOKED
When Josh said what’s the longest a sidemen Sunday should be I see why he asked that now 😂
Rich ksi= npc bully bro its bad
Bro i dont have 3 hours
this is gonna be so epic, i can already tell!!
Calling people NPC's on a holiday they will have saved up for leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Don't care how much he's worth, it's not a good look
Soooo this video is not monetised.. They are making NO BANK!! And entertaining us!!!
this video is longer and better than their netflix movie 😭
Tobi laughing whilst sliding down the hill was funny asf
I don’t like how JJ acted on the bus in this one, even if he didn’t mean it can see how he coulda been mad annoying and the dude just wanted a picture he didn’t need to be called an NPC like that.
early
At about 9:30, Ethan's laugh sounds like the Minecraft eating noise
3 hours is mad
W intro
38:17 ayo😮
This is like a sidemen movie 3 hours 😮
8:30 lowkey why im losing respect for the sidemen they slowly becomin obnoxious n rude
This is gonna be a long dinner 😂😂 absolutely love these videos
Let’s get it, i beg jj on the bad team 😂😂😂
KSI is hella annoying, spoilt brat
3hours of epicness is this going to be a regular thing? If so I'm here for it 💪 and a josh vid 👌
45 minutes in and there's a lot that should've been left on the cutting room floor to be honest...
Its more fun when Ethan and JJ are on the cheap team
W josh
WTH 3 hrs Sidemen sunday 🥶
Not JJ having to be taken down cause he couldn’t sledge 😂
Please turn closed captions on. I don’t mind if they’re auto generated
How r these man getting 300k views in 30min. That's insane
This concept is getting boring
Jjs pissed
BE HONEST WHO’S WATCHING 3 FCKING HOURS OF A VIDEO
I love with even Side+ we are still getting quality and not making the videos short
Um 3 hours ???!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
25:13 These transitions look like they're out of a sitcom. Brilliant editing and filming
Whoever edited this video, needs a raise
3 fuckin hours
YESSSSSS 3 HR I LOVE YALLL
Who’s gonna beat 3 hours 🎉🎉

This is about to be the best 3 hrs Im gonna watch. I love these guys so much and I dont want it to end.
Sidemen really soldout to onlyfans
3 hoursh hahahaa
FK JJ, he ruins all the fun for the good team :D he should be removed from these kinda videos :/
Them hating on vik turns my mood off every effing time. Vik should just leave sidemen for his self respect.
This is going to be one of those videos we all look back at years from now talking about how good it is
3 hours! Let me get the popcorn! Can’t wait
Ethan and JJ just violating that dude in the bus calling him and NPC was outta pocket😂
The last time I remember a video this long was the Europe Holiday trip and that one was a banger so I excited for this one
Fair play. I'm too old to admit to watching these (same age as them) but they've pretty much replaced Sunday night top gear with these sort of videos
This is a milestone vid, 3 HOURS IS INSANE!
😑
3 mf hours this video better be worth every second of my life
thats a whole azz film bruh 😂 it'd be a long dinner
Three hour sidemen Sunday and a Zerka video? This about to be an absolute all timer

Jj is so ungrateful he never enjoys the good things
Vik & Harry are the elite duo in the slopes

KSI unhinged. Menace
I really didn’t like the way the treated the other people on the bus. They really have lost tough with reality
Another Banger 🔥 🔥
15:44 WOOOOO
jj's a tad bit weird. Also I thought Tobi only gave the facials
So this is what Josh meant when he said  they have a big shoot in the previous sidemen sunday
WHAT A GREAT VIDEO.
Josh wasn’t kidding from the last sidemen Sunday video. This is a big video let’s go Josh let’s go sideman.
Omg a 3 hour sidemen sunday and zerkka hosting, let get some popcorn 🍿
So excited for the upload then had to do a double take as I thought I seen wrong but I was correct. 3 hour video. I am ready.
No Ksi is like having a sandwich with no bread

I was gonna watch the entire video until JJ got on the bad team and started moaning and screaming on the bus I ain't sitting through another American roadtrip video bro, bros way too loud and privileged... What a shame first L of the year boys... Welp there's always next Sunday
just when I thought a sidemen sunday couldn’t get any longer they prove me wrong. this is gonna be memorable
3 hours? For a video that theyve done many times. Forget that. Way too long. Anyine whonhas time to watch this in full diesnt have a life

Y’all really made a sidemen Sunday the same length as Oppenheimer
KSI is actually pissing me off now. On the good team and STILL complaining.
This whole “watch filthy rich people go on filthy rich vacations” stuff has been run into the ground more than JJs “being loud is my personality” shtick.
I'm loving all these Switzerland videos, makes me feel strangely proud of my home country ^^.
ISI just gets more dislikable every video
Always a blessing to wake up to a Fresh Sidemen holiday video🙌

On that note, today is my birthday so having a 3 hour video has to be the best gift today, and i was hoping if i could get a happy birthday just because why not.

Shoutout to all 7 sidemen and the editors for giving us a 3 hour banger
Editer cooked🗣️
it's uploaded later than usual and now I see why 😁😁 3 hrs
we need more 3 hour videos please
Them being on the bus was unbearable. Just straight laughing at people for being poorer than them. Jj doesn’t realise that these cheap holidays that he ridicules are regular people’s highlight of their year or even life. Normally it can be passed as ‘content’, but acting out in front of people just enjoying themselves and calling them “npc’s” was painful to watch. He really stopped being funny a while ago and is just loud and complains
Imagine calling a fan a npc ego on ksi is wild these days. Dont forget where u come from
I really don't mind a 3 hour Sidemen Sunday. Already the start of the intro was great.
Love joshs energy so far
Sheeeesh feels like Christmas ❤
The best Sidemen video of the year and potentially ever.
we can only pray sent me offf 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
3 hourssss wowwww
3 hrs😍
Vikk and Harry = W
I'm assuming josh cooked this one up coz 3 hours is WILD
3 hours , it’s gonna take me forever to complete this
2 half hour banger last week and a 3 hour banger this week ... These guys are class
4:30 normal people???
3 hours bro??
Putting out the content atm

2:12:05  KSI posture had me dying 😭
A reminder that JJ is a well known celebrity, rapper, boxer and more. Yet he is chilling with NPC's on a school trip.
One time the Sidemen should trick them and book them both the good holiday,  thinking they have both are in the good team.
3 hours jesus christ
Too tier sidemen sunday
Me watching this at 8:15pm knowing full well of if i dont go to sleep at 10 i aint waking up in time tmmrw😂
3 hours long or even 2 hours long is too long. one and a half hour max is the ideal duaration.

Sidemen have been releasing a banger of videos this year❤
3 hour video and a 3 hour BTS? This is the most amount of content we’ve ever got on a Sunday
Josh cooked button>>>>
i have been praying for days like these, 3 hours of sidemen content
Not even watched it and I can already tell that they know what their fans want, longer videos where people feel included and engaged. Most other countries don’t understand the group like most of the UK does so they’re not interested. These are self made celebrities created by their own audience and hard work.
3 hour sidemen Sunday, living in the best time line rn
This is gunna be a banger
Josh looking extra grey at the start 😂😂😂😂
3 hours whattttt good job guys
A movie literally!!!!!
