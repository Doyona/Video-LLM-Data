Best for me to discontinue writing... Go find someone else to fit your bank account.. go find another to write your legacy.. looks like you all lost the holy Ghost....
God I love this song so much. I fell in love with this song in prison. I was just released 4 weeks ago and this still hits me. Even harder now that I see the video. I don’t suffer from addiction any longer but the familiar feelings remain.
Isn't funny you can change your ways for someone defending your empty space
Jake Paul being the annoying douche bag makes sense. Everyone has that person who doesn’t understand how heartbreaking moments can be
this deep af its painful but man i love it.  i got 6 years clean but them side eyes and lack of trust. it makes me want to go back and be the picture they already have of me
Three of my fav artist collabing was amazing!!! The lyrics are just insane. Love this song
My brother od on june last year and I  remember hearing this and I just broke down felt like I felled him we didn't get along much anymore was like I was living with a stranger I talk to him one last time time but it never took just still miss him .
i WOULD LOVE PIZZA RIGHT NOW PLEASE, life hAs been rough for mE. I DID IT NOW PLeASE. jUST KIDDING...
Hole album has me tears😢
This song makes me think of my best friend that i lost to a drug addiction and she is still fighting it to this day. I hope one day she can do the right thing and help herself
I gave her 20 years, 2 kids that werent mine, 1 that was me that she turned on my whole family but still asks money, still calls me a loser but im the only one who pays for her to live even after she used her family so bad that a 73 yr old man cant retire even after holding 3 jobs for 13 yrs....
I sent it to my daughter but she didn't hear it. She's already gone.
I'm a Muslim but an alcoholic. This is a discussion me and my brothers have daily.  Pray for me
Hope..... And someone to just believe in u. A kind word. Recognition.
THIS “IS” A REAL SONG!! ITS ALSO DEEP ON MANY LEVELS OF LIFE!!❤
These comments are beautiful, my ex was addicted to coke meth and alcohol, he fell so deep down the whole and refused to let any of us help him, I hope he does better I believe in every single one of you, it’s painful aswell being on the other side watching your partner deteriorate
Hope you hear this mom, maybe it would've changed things
My six week old lost his dad to addiction. I lost my fiance. He’s still alive but he’s not him anymore.
Almost 12 years of listening and here I am at 25 and relating to every word just like I was 12 13 again listening to what I wanna be when I grow up and stuff 👊 my all time favorite nf for sure
I miss my best friends…
This shit is deep this is one I hate but I love it hard to listen to
can you ask for a better duo ❤❤❤❤❤ thx use I'ma try to get my shit together and get clean
Been on both sides of the fence on this one they both tuff😢
Hey Jason you should have pulled me out when you had a chance......... You're welcome for making your job a thousand times easier.... A good start to a bad finish
Love how his raps always show both sides of the story
This is on par with “lost ones” by j Cole and maybe even Stan by Em. It takes a special artist to write a song like this.
I had 10 years and threw it all away and now I’m trying to get myself back and I feel like I’m constantly failing I can’t just let it go being sick is rough as fuck and I’ve put myself through it cold turkey so many times to make myself never do it again but here I am I feel so lost and I just need to go cuz I can’t take it anymore
This song always makes me tear up, reminds me of my brother and I.  RIP Ceez.
Addiction stole my best friend of 32 years, we've literally been through all walks of life together since we were both 3 years old! I won't mention names because I still protect her, she didn't have an easy time in life, like most but she wasn't strong enough to face her demons and choose to numb herself instead. We've all been through terrible things in life but no matter what, nothing that happens to me in this life would ever make me pick up a pipe or needle, but it doesn't mean I don't have sympathy for others who aren't as strong and that's not me being nasty or negative and saying they are weak they've just been strong for too long and get to a breaking point it happens to the best of us. You can have sympathy but also boundaries I won't stay in touch with my friend when I know she's using so to not enable her in any way. You can't control what others do in life and the choices they make but you can be there to set the tone and say what you will and won't accept when it comes to addiction so you don't hurt yourself in the process. She's lost everyone family, friends and I've never given up on her or turned my back on her. Some may say why can't you be there for her during her bad times I am but when addicts won't accept help and they keep repeating the same cycles over and over again whilst watching the damage they are causing themselves is crazy...my friend got so bad in her addiction she nearly lost her life and instead of getting out and staying clean she continued to do what she was doing that landed her in hospital and with so many different health issues afterwards, it's lucky she's even still here and instead of appreciating her second chance she squanders it by choosing to continue this vicious cycle. It's hard to watch and it comes to a point where you have to say okay if I can't help and she won't do anything to help herself I need to take a step back for my own wellbeing and mental health it's not something that I'm hanging around to watch. You can't even begin to imagine the emotional turmoil it's caused me and that's down to the fact that I know who she is, she's a good person with a good heart and I absolutely love the ground she walks on but drugs turn her into someone else and not the person I know or love. Doesn't mean that I don't have hope that she can get clean, she can she just chooses not too and that's what happens with addicts they selfishly put it before everything and all of those that are involved that love them have to sit back and slowly watch the person they knew disappear.
Shit got me in tears rn
I've been in recovery since 2018. I was a IV heroin user.  My sister is 7years older than me. She never struggled with addiction until I got clean. She watched me struggle for 4 years, she watched me lose everything that meant anything to me because of it. She still went out and followed in my footsteps. This song touches my heart so much, because I know what she's going through and I also know that I can't save her. She has to save herself.
Ya ,cuz that shit goes sooo deep in our communities it's not funny.
❤
@ladygaga catch me

This song hits so hard in so many ways 😢😢😢
How can one find true love when we gaslight the f*** out of them
Those who wanna play this, its a beat saber dlc(downloadable content)which is from the shock drops dlc
Penny Wade @pennywade6395 I dedicate this song to the memory of who I thought you were when we met... I hope you make it out...
me and my brother went from doing oxys and anything else we could get our hands on to breaking into houses but 7 years ago he overdosed on fentanyl and that day is the day i started my new journey, from living on peoples couches to owning my own house , R.I.P Big Brother One Love!
November 12, 2025 will be 16 months clean off crack. And I'm doing in homeless sleeping on the sidewalk.
@joynerlucasofficial - this song is amazing! You and jelly roll are both killing it out there! I’m a lifelong fan and currently in my room at a halfway house in Worcester right off Main south! This ain’t the first time in recovery for me but hopefully the last one day at a time. The only positive of being in these programs over the last 15 years of my life is all the work I’ve been putting in to be a better person and the skills I’ve gained are never lost and I’ve put in more work than most anyone on earth and I’m still doing it so we will see what happens but great song!!
People that don't understand this disease would never understand the pain and struggle, but they in tittle to feel how they feel for the love they have for they love ones seeing them self-destruct ,I know ,I'm in recovery been clean for 30 days ,is hard but not impossible we got to be willing and ready for a change ,not for nobody but for ourselves..
No amount of guilt can change my past 😢 No amount of anxiety can change my future 😢 This I know , &  believe in it with conviction 🙏❤️💯
If you think of my friend who is a drug addict and hang with the wrong people and I ended up getting murdered
I sent this to my mother in June , she’s been an addict for over 33 years . It’s now the end of October and she’s finally in rehab for the first time ever in her life . Praying she makes it through and stays clean
Told my gf and best friends that I wasn't happy and wanted to be gone and they all told me im not trying hard enough. Ive gone to therapy for them ive tried everything they have recommend but i just feel the same. The other day I blew up and yelled at them and now nobody will talk to me. Im sorry I said anything I should have just ended it long ago I just hurt everyone.
Im a recovering addict I heard this song when I was in treatment center. 1yr 6m sober today
I wish I was able to send this to my mother before she passed in 09. I really think it would have changed her and my whole life
I am 30 days clean after 15 years of drugs and my wife of 12 years is still out there getting high. Broken hearts can mend but takes patience. Please pray for her. As soon as I see her I'm taking her to detox by God's grace. Love you all. God bless and give me the strength Lord. 🙏💖💖✝✝
I lost my brother just about last year and this song just sits differently in my heart. Thank you for this.
this song hit the hardest and closest to home for people who have family members and friends with addictions for me its been my mom dad and uncle moms doing the best out of them but still addictted to pot to an extreme level which people will say oh its not it is especially when you spend most of your paycheck on it per month and dealing with my dad and uncles pill addiction has been very rough over the years im hoping to get my dad on the right track before i move out but idk i feel like im losing myself in that household i become a person i dont like to cope with stress so i have to go for my own sanity. also jelly rolls music has helped me through my most challenging problems and i couldnt be more grateful to that wonderful atrist.
I needed to hear this song. Thank you!
“I feel like the drugs is made for sinning that’s why I’ve been stuck in the same position”   “Be SOBER, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:” ‭‭1 Peter‬ ‭5‬:‭8‬ ‭KJVAAE‬‬
Im actively tryna get sober off of alcohol been drinking for as long as I can remember it's not easyi understand both sides of this song hits deep
You don't. Love is always unconditional. Even when you move on you still keep the love.
2 weeks strong I’m tired of this shit 😞
Dayummm!
This one hits home so hard
I feel like you can't listen to this song without the video...  Wow. 😮
This song is epic.
The second half of this song is criminally underrated. As an addict, you expressed the thoughts and feelings I've had and never knew how to express. After having cut off my family because they're always trying to "fix" me and act like I'm trying to throw my life away on purpose...I never felt I had the right support to get sober with them. I did what I had to do and cut them all off and paved my own way to sobriety. Now, 5 years later, I've built a new life for me without them because I had to focus on what was best for me.
Holy shit... This hits so hard. I'm legit crying. Fuck addiction! I've been battling that shit for 20 years... it's exhausting.
Need some help
My cousin was on the stuff and a diabetic rest in peace cuzzo I'll miss u
This song hits me deep enough to make me tear up  41yrs old was almost 23months sober n just got injured n fell off but im all set up to go get better tomorrow,  🙏  for me I know I got this...
30 days today thanks to God and my WILLPOWER
My cousin is on drugs, really wish he would get the help😢
Miss you Chad, hope your free
💯  #jellyroll this still helps ppl MAN NEVER FUCKING CHANGE U A BLESSING N A GIFT FROM GOD ALL THE PAIN N STRUGGLES PAID OFF ❤🎉
I think about my kids mother every time I play this song . I just came home from being locked up for a while and have both of my kids n I tell u its not easy , but I wouldn't change it for nothing . Just goda pray for her 🙏
This song saves my life every single day thank yall 🙏
Sadly me and my fiancée are still fighting this fight!! I pray every day that God will help us overcome this!!! I am so sick and tired of being sick and tired!!! 😢😢😢

Im a recovering heroin and fentanyl addict.  In truth, I should be dead.. but I made it through hell.  I heard this song on a random Playlist and started crying because it so accurately portrays the fight on the other side of an active addict.  The fight those who love us fight every day we continue to use.  Im one of the lucky ones.. but I don't have to be the only one.  Its possible to survive hell.  Addicts love too... and when we wake up, we can find that love again.    To those who'll know this is for them... Ask for help.   I know you cant imagine quitting but... ask.  Youll find it.
This song made me cry because my husband has addictions and I pray for him. He is locked up but hopefully gets help so when we are together again we can be a happy family... Not giving up on him. We have been through so much. God hear my prayers for him and if everyone out there can pray for him. Always pray that people with addictions can overcome these struggles in life. Better late than never and in some cases sooner the better. In Jesus name. Amen.
I hope this CITY BURNS since y’all wanna be fake
Don’t let it hit you on the ass when you live the city!!! I was here before you were even born!!!
It's October and I want to get in shape. I'll do one push up for every like.
This song brings me to tears.. each & every time I hear it. I've been on both side of this, being an addict, then getting clean & still loving an addict.. may recovery find anyone who is struggling, my heart truly goes out to each & everyone who listens to this because I know you're doing it for a reason..
How can y’all not see that I can write out 5 good movie ideas from this song🎦🎬
Jelly roll is whole another level ❤❤
I have a brother who has been in and out of addiction for 11 years. He has recently tried to end everything and it was traumatic for a lot of people around him. I needed to hear this song today and I think he does to.
Love to sing the part jell roll sings was told I sing just like him 😅
XO 🧡
U ARE A GOOD DIRECTOR
Wow , everything about this. Thank you 🙌🏻
I can't Love this enough. The way you took it back to I'm not racist. Jesus Christ. Literally. I fucks with you Joyner.
0:25 I love you❤️❤️❤️❤️
Addiction is the hardest thing to fight. Sigh... Hurting those who love you. Sigh
I also survived a school shooting, though not as devastating as others, it still sticks in my mind, some 11 years later. Thank you for this beautiful song
I been sober for a lil minute. My lil cousin who look up to me just sent me this and it really touched me💯
I pray for anyone that needs to know that YOU are loved
This song made me cry internally
This reminds me of my aunt that died because of drugs she was not  addition she was in a bad accident
Can't Lie, It's been long enough to know, this is by far my favorite song. Ever.
I finally realized i have a problem and am now putting down the xanax and adderall for good
Still listening in 2025. ❤
My brother struggled with addiction and this song hits home 💔 rip brother   05/10/2020 😭💔🙏
May God Bless you, Joyner🕯🙏 ❤️. Your ability to convey emotions through your music is truly unparalleled. Thank you for sharing your talent with the world; it inspires so many of us. Watching from South Africa 🇿🇦❤️
18 yrs of smack,now 53 sitting on my own in Dublin at a lough of a canal,smipeing a crack pipe,This song comes on,bringing realizeation and tears making me think what the fk am I doing,I need Jesus,I need help,DMX RIP I'm a big boy now,though I'm still not grown,still going threw it the pain and the hurt...What a song,POWERFULL
35 years as an addict!.. 2 years clean
This is in my Top 3 best hip hop Songs of all time. Hands down
Ive battled with addiction for most of my life, and  society says it's a disease, which eventually it does become  a disease  (of the mind) But it  always starts with a choice, then a bunch more bad choices until you spiral out of control to the point  where you choose you can't live like that anymore or incarceration, or even death.  Addiction always goes hand in hand with mental health, you may have always had them, or afterwards the addiction creates them.
What a beautiful, truthful and brilliant tribute. Thank you for doing this Tom ❤
😭😩❤️
Made me and my wife cry..RIP Charlie..😢❤
2 years clean from Alcohol was in a dark place for a very long time until I found the light.
Misunfortune is realest towards yourest. Misunderchannel unspoken. Stolen Characteristics, mental ed conversate. Love Miss Oui Boo Stan the little man.
😢
he wasnt serious about quitting though. didn't even have the water on when he dumped the pills in the sink. you know hes going back for those later...ehem
Damn bro💔thank you for the song, it hits home
I had to come back to this classic my son's dad took his life September 2nd he overdosed leaving 5 kids behind I had to run to my therapy 🎶🎶 thank you for making this Joyner!
BROOOOOOOOOOOO!!! I appreciate The Joystar so much, you make me wanna leave South Africa just to shake your hand, like therapy is not affordable rn but music became that n through ppl like THIS n Wayne etc Im still borderline sane n alive so S/O  to all in this section lord knows id be in rehab.
Let them go? Simple, walk that seeeet ass out dat doooo! Better is coming.
❤hey mo fo, About suicide yesterday,  heard this but would like 2 interview you over the pho😅😊Phoenix judgements cycle,  let's full throttle it, may 16th 2040😊 h33 haw😅
Fucking 🔥
This is a song I dedicated for my sister. This song hits hard bc we ain’t been talking in forever and I miss her. I hate that she chose pills and other drugs over myself and our mom. I’d do anything to make her realize she’s fucking up her life. You can take a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. Remember that
It's a good song but when a person is addicted don't push they away sometimes it takes two themselves and one other person to help them out and this Rose should never be walked alone trust me
As someone who's suffering.... Thank you Joyner...
This!! "everyone calling that shit a disease and making you feel like you in the right, but I hate the fact that you be usin that to do what you like or do you might" 🙌🙌
I felt like he just completely dissected my relationship with my life and loved ones
If you really love someone, you'll never be able to let them go, period!
This shit has me crying bro no songs ever made me cry before
I LOVE Joyner's music ❤❤❤
It's tough out there than it seems
“If you don’t believe in yourself you will never believe somebody who believes in you” ✍️: Joyner Lucas 🙌🏾
"If you don't believe in yourself then you'll never believe in somebody believing in you..." hits so hard. Joyner is truly one of the best ever.
🫩and psych meds will not help YOU
You will learn to stand alone in your own household 🇺🇸
Yesss bro. Bringing back the Story telling ! . Been listening to you since 2017. MA!!!
Anyone finding this guy from a short reel in 2025?
The song really hits home it's like people think you enjoy being a f****** addict like I wake up in the morning and I I'm like I want to be an addict today if you haven't lived it you don't understand I get so tired of fighting but I love this song
When I think me and you I think what I miss the most is me you there as you still wonder if I know if she there.

You there now and she love you k dawg as me I see what y'all was doing for me (bo you just don't get it do you !!!)  I just wish so many things now just like I did then but there's difference then and difference now i missed you In my bed and didn't know why if I could do things different it would be to make less mistakes and deny the hell out anyone besides me for you like I wanted for me  and have less anger and less angels around acting love me just for confusion of what they doing to myself cause I miss all the steps that I see  if it wasnt there and here at the same time ,plus not to mention who is him to her just everyone and not me and nobody listening besides Chris and vann demon don't trust noone and or  soone as in which I love you never but what I can do is limited now I need you like I need me but you not there like I should be I just want change for us if that's still anything that you and me could have I still want it so many things were taken away from me and you and just handed right to others and individuals gone be individuals as for me and you we just you and me we always been there with each other I love you Satan I always know where you'll be at
Now isn't that true 💀💀
He does not get the respect he deserves! We need to go on and give this man his flowers. The way JL tells a story and every song and album he puts out, he’s the definition of what a lyricist is. I absolutely love this man.
I remember i sat in tears when i first heard this , in the midst of my addiction
Dam this song hits home 😢😢😢 I been struggling these past few years with my demons n life I just need it all to go away n have my life back 😭
As a recovering addict, every time things get difficult I come n listen to this song. Great music can do that for you, especially with topic of so many ppl that are suffering
"IN LOVE W A STRANGER " HITS HOME 💯 💪 💪
Love it! All of them are soooo amazing! Love the calibration! Then again their GenX so not shocked they can work together.
These guy need a standing ovation when they played this song wherever tour they went 🫡🫡🫡
Rest in peace dad… 08/25/2025 ❤
My sister comes to mind whenever I hear this

I pray for humanity 😢
I wish the person that sent me this video would get professional help and stop wasting their time doing nothing but damaging their heart, soul and body. SA, get the help you need and stop all the BS. Youre life will be cut short if you continue the dangerous path you're on. Please dont cut your road short. Continue building your road. You know what you need to do... JUST DO IT. #rehab

Sadly me and my girl found out we she had a miscarriage
I’ve been clean 5 years. After doing a prison sentence and losing everything that was important to me. I tried quitting so many times. I begged God to take the addiction away from me. I couldn’t be stronger than the disease but I’m starting over
I like Jelly Roll. Good stuff again Own it!
Proud of Jelly he losing the weight🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🫡
Im losing my brother and everytime I try to help his lies become so believable and I fall for it over and over ..am I wrong for feeling like letting go cuz its tearing my life apart?
As long as my kids are better than me that's all that fucking matters to me❤❤❤
Help everyone you can please❤❤❤
Wow this message came across my feed at the right time! His timing is perfect isn’t it?!? I’m embarrassed to say but I’m emotionally struggling being the caregiver for my grandfather who has dementia and my elder parents. And I know God is preparing me I just needed the conformation.
too all the soldiers we lost through life always thinking of you
Rip to my bros. I’m sorry I’m here and you’re not.
This song has both helped me get out of Addiction and now stay in sobriety. What an amazing way to show both sides. Jelly, you are a leader of light into this world. Grateful for your creativity and love. ❤

After his death I barely talked to them anymore cause I dont what I can do for them . Rip matt you got clean and this shit happens to you I'll see you soon brother . 😢
This goes hard 🔥
Music is beautiful. An art that will bring us to life and also kill us all in one moment.
I have a family member thats got a bad drinking problem and it’s ruining his life. He’s now homeless cause we couldn’t put up with his addiction affecting our lives. I tried to help him by bringing him somewhere with some support and people who care, but how can I help him if he doesn’t wanna help himself. 😔 Nothing I suppose, just tough love
Kat honestly I am really happy I get to spend your last night here and finish off this chapter in b your life with someone you truly adore you And will b remind you just how special you Are!!! ❤ you hun and I really want to cuddle the shirt out of you
I miss you but I’ve got to do what’s best for me.
I love you joyner and jelly for this man shit hit my soul
I listened to this song a lot last year. My mother was an alcoholic, and no matter what I did or said, I just couldn't get through to her. All I could do was watch her rot away. I felt this song in my heart every time I listened.  On August 5th, 2024, my Mom had a severe health scare. I thought I was going to lose her. I remember listening to this song again again just balling my eyes out.  Today, I'm beyond proud to say that she is officially 1 year sober!!! This song still draws tears to my eyes, but they are happy ones. I love my Mom so much.
How come most ppl only know JR as a country singer?
She should have that there in the living room.. It's where she wanted to be anyway.  Leave me for someone else, dont bother coming back.
Joyner 🐐 status
We need more of this kinda songs, this is a life changer 😭
This song should get a Grammy ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤😢
You know I sat here listening this and looking at Joyner. Man, it must have torn you up to write these lyrics.  Thank you for you hard work broski, no diddy we love u and we appreciate u cuz
I love Joyner Lucas ❤❤❤
Joyner z the real deal
I can relate to everything they say
I fucking love this song
A daily listen for me keeps me humble and away from what ruined my life
Master piece and a classic 🙏💪
Rest in peace. Brother. Rest in peace, Doodle. This song didn't come out soon enough for you two. 😞
sacrifices u  made for me I never know...
I was the last born I got my dad at a older age I saw him age quickly and and his health wasn’t good he was in and out the hospital though my teenage years my childhood was boring he was always at work came home my parents would argue every day till the day he passed I miss him I hope he see how much I changed since 2018
Danny is a shining example of how people can choose to break out of the cycle of violence, crime and addiction. It reminds me of the Alex Warren & Jelly Roll song bloodline. Way to go Danny you are a truly strong man and it has nothing to do with muscles.
This low key upset me. Being in recovery is hard as fuck. We fight for our lives everyday..this is a disease. We already feel shame and guilt. We don't need anyone beating us down more than we do ourselves..we love our families more than anything, but if you don't know maybe you should hear it from the mouth of someone that survived the chokehold this shit has on a person. Please take a moment and pray for the addict that still suffers.

"If you don't believe in yourself,  you'll never believe in someone believing in you" man that hits home
Not long ago, I (a white alcoholic) had a roommate (a good hearted African American). We worked at the same company and became good friends so we decided to stay in an apartment together. My addiction only got worse though and drove a wedge between our friendship. Watching this feels exactly how things went. It doesn’t matter what your addiction is, it will slowly isolate you from people you care about. Then, everything will collapse before you realize it…

Greatest rap artist on the face of this earth, rn. Joyner, like, fuck, man… how you are able to rap so mf well about completely miniscule subject matters such as white noise and have it turn out to be so relateble and be one of the best songs I’ve ever heard in my life is something I’m not able to even begin to wrap my mind around, but I appreciate it and I appreciate you, man. As a 38 year old caucasian male who has been and still is severely impacted in mostly negative ways by my ADHD, thank you.
This is so good! Joyner is the goat
Just lost my dad a few weeks ago due to addiction.. man I would do anything to just say I love you & im sorry for not forgiving sooner 💔

I feel.so many people see something/someone in me, that i dont see in myself at all. Atleast not anymore.
💙🖤
Real 🔥
“Isn’t it funny to change your ways?    For someone to fill in that empty space.” Is heart breaking.💔
listening to the 1st half of the song,anger creeping up on me ready to change and  listen to other songs but something deep inside tell me to wait and the 2nd half comes barreling towards me like a freaking train.
This hits hard especially in this age as all we have in the west now is drugs alcohol and hatred
Wow! That was great.  My eldest brother had an addiction to cocaine. As his kid sister (or 'Sid Kister', he'd sometimes call me), I looked up to him. He was smart and charming...eventually I grew up and realized how manipulative and deceptive he was...always had been...and I stopped answering his calls. I told him I was no longer making space in my life for toxic individuals, blood or otherwise, and I told him, "And as close as we were, I'm putting you at the top of the list."   It irritated him how I would no longer check on him, and it hurt Mom's heart how I was steadfast in my determination to never let him close to me again.  Everything happens for a reason, tho. And it's ironic how the one relative that no longer associated with him would be to one to single-handedly organize his funeral; thing is, he had died, to me, years prior.  I miss him sometimes. I hear his voice sometimes when I speak...his intonation and condescending sense of humor that I've somehow made my own (must be a family trait).   It's too bad really. I'd like to think that next lifetime, we'd meet again and could have a brother/sister relationship worth having.
Sober since nov 2nd last year everyday is a fight and struggle it’s not easy but it’s worth it I hope all addicts can find recovery and get help before it’s to LATE! I’ve lost like 5 friends and 2 family members to addiction now! RIP to everyone we’ve lost! God bless and help us all ❤🎉
I had an grandpa who did drugs I keep warning him and 1 year later he died and lessing to this song remember him and he played this song when my girlfriend broke up
Heard this the first time in rehab, November 2024. Some of the most soulful, intelligent, wonderful people need help. I'm praying for you, pray for me too.
Hi all. First time I discovered joyner Lucas was in lucky you with Eminem... Your on top form man 🎉 Just came across this song. I got a brain tumour from psychiatric medication and my only sibling has brain damage from the same family of medication 😢 We both had addiction to cannabis and myself alcohol..... Other addictions but nothing heavy! My brother lost his mind to drugs and Eminem😅luckily, because it pulled him bk to reality!  We both were sectioned eventually....  Stay away from drugs people.... I am piecing together my life again. I hope you know you are special to whom is reading this ❤
I pray for those who struggle with addiction 🙏
I lost my daughter on July 1st 2025. From overdose. We tried so hard to help her. I listened to this song so many times and sent it to her. Now I listen knowing my daughter is gone forever
✝️🤟💯💪
Broooo holy shit i love the uk but i really hope you aint the best there is, cuz all of my life i never heard noone say put on that skepta shit… holy shit dude you killed him
I sent thys song to My mom..... She is the 1st verse... The second verse is Me... I'm not an addict or nothing.... However My life is fucked lol..... But it's funny.... Cuz I used to be the 1st verse to her when I was a child.... But it hurts so bad to KNOW that your parent doesn't see u for who u are..... Mainly because they not ok with their self..... It breaks My heart because it takes Me back to when I was a Kid n didn't have her.... N guess wat... After 20 years clean she has to go back to treatment.... Even with that.... Shes blind.... She still thynk she better than Me
I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with my ex fiancee and it took listening to this song to realize that I could live without her right now im dating a wonderful woman who treats me with the respect I deserve so thank you savanna for this song

LYRICS:  How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay? Yeah, I got somebody I love (yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (whoa) But I wrote this song in hopes when they'll hear it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it as much (whoa) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and makin' you feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (do what you might, whoa) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (lose it) And you in denial about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay? Look, I know you been callin' for me (yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (uh) How do I let go of something I know is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?

🥹 I need a jelly roll and Joyner Lucas song about a struggling relationship between a father and daughter because he continuously chooses drinking and you find out over 15 years after your parents divorce that he never really wanted to be a dad in the first place. I wrote some lyrics because writing helps me heal.
01 July 2025 & this song is still a masterpiece ❤️
Oh my god, this touched me bad. Took me back. Been clean 2 n half years now. Damn, crying. Jelly roll music always get me. But i never ewally liatened to joyner. But now i am.
Spit them bars of my life bro❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You really on a different type level my guy keep dropping these bangers 🔥🔥🔥🔥

My cousin that I looked up to my whole life as my brother. The person I wanted to be like. He was aggressive and he always had a plan and he was hooked on powder and lots of drinking and acting crazy and always worried about police. No matter how much I can talk to him he kept trying to take himself out of the game and he finally succeeded 2 months ago. With a rope. everyone is so mad right now
everyone posting about their soberness is great......yet it misses the whole point of the song  lmao
One of the worst songs he has done
Such a beautiful song ...❤
From me to me.

Cash Rules Everything! Joyner riding the hype train but can't give a hip hop artist 16 bars? Fk outta here
So true my uncle passed due to an overdose and so did one of my closest people both due to fentanyl
been taking a break from alcohol going for a year , im at 11 months now .. people think its all perfect and I should just keep going , but no one cares for the war inside my head ..  im 30 yrs old if I wanna have a couple drinks to let loose and wind down im legally allowed to .. Theres so many people that just wanna portray shit like why do you care so much about someone else's sobriety ?  maybe you should let people be them and get sober yourself if you see that as a problem .. and if you are sober ?? Cool dont push that on other people .. Because I dont push my shit onto other people I just smoke my weed and drink my whiskey at the end of the day when alls said and done .. Have a nice steak ..
I know this song is more of staying around your love ones but I left…. I couldn’t nomore he was traumatizing my daughter. I had to let go
Would like to see lekks, no face cover to see the delivery, cos he goes hard on almost every track
How can you judge a book by its cover just like John S yall like to make  songs about him and put him under God's eyes back in 2020 and hes been fighting cancer love your music and all but this man needs al the support we can give yal know how child support work father pays 40 percent and mother pays 60 had a great time in evens vill 61 employees is impressive keep up the good vibes !! GCODE.
Trauma is real self medicating to cope with the past to numb the pain and suffering one can live life doing normal things like normal people but never tell no one about the addiction just to feel right to get threw everyday being alone Suicide effects not just that person it effects the whole family in the same way it’s a fight to break the cycle and to over come the  demons but the sickness as well
I texted best for me to the number on the screen but didn't get any message back. Just thought someone should know so maybe it can get updated or whatever needs to happen in order for it to work. Thank you 🙏 All Glory and Honor to God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit forever and ever AMEN 🙏🙌🙏🙌🙏🙌❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I just relapsed a month and a half ago after being sober for 8 years. Definitely not my proudest moment. I want to stop and not ever crave it again. But I feel stuck and sucked in by the feeling of smoking crack when you get those bell ringers.. 😅😅😢😢
I can’t let him go. David Hoskins

My bro sent me this the other day and this is me and him going back and forth...I was the addict he addicted to Jesus like I was a junkbox, and we both felt we were right... My who life all I knew was me and him first, then my other siblings and I helped raise them with our young mom.. now we can't even talk normally..I'm not on drugs but he can't go two minutes or two sentences without bringing up the Bible or Jesus..  this was spot on in the words... I love that kid and worry about him all the time but idk how to help him cuz he's stuck as if he was a junkbox...it's crazy
On repeat. Bet the views are going up lol

I had to learn to let go of my best friend and my empty space has never filled 💔
13 days sober June 11th been a year long journey finally feel good today, im done
Jelly is a G.O.A.T
The hopelessness and despair of being an addict is captured quite well here. Especially when not only you yourself are an addict but when you're in love with one too...
3:07 that's raw
😳
Woke up and slammed my.half a beer. Withdrawing from opiates and getting rdy for work.  I've pushed everyone away( not that there were many there anyway.) But I'm 2k miles from home. My phone never ever rings. I'm only here for.my dog. Then I'm done
Been sober for 11 years. Yes there is hope
Turn this up!
After almost 40 years of addiction my mother passed on may 28th. I hope she finally found peace
Damn man this hit so hard. Currently I’m battling alcohol addiction, it’s been bad the past three years. Just today, my fiance went to look at apartments to get away from me. We have three kids with one on the way. This song helps me get through struggle days
Cudos to the bearded actor on rapping/acting the second rap
I wish that my loved one would have went to rehab when I kept asking he would be alive today. Rest in peace baby.😢😢😢😢😢
je so good at being compassionate and showing both sides of the war. amd I adore jelly roll and joyner lucas.
Word
😢
I know this some came out over a year ago but I just wanted to tell people music helps with shit
This isnt gonna make sense but I am going through shit like music helps nothin related to drugs but my parents got divorced im hurt by it and I feel like music is there but I know that people are going through some real shit you know sorry it dosent make sense but still
My brother got locked up today for more than 3 years. This song is really hitting differently today
I lost my fiance to drug use in April we have a newborn that I’m now taking care of alone . I had a friend send me this and I’m so hurt . I can’t stop crying I wish I knew this before he died
Ill do 20 push ups for every like!!!!!
I love this song❤
I have no one to send this too because I rather leave the rest of you in a world without me enjoy hell people
Ive had to let go of two parents because of addiction, one to meth and the other to alcohol. I love my parents, I always will, but I could see it was wrong as a child, now Im the age they were when I was born and I have my own kids now and I think, "Wow, how could you choose addiction over your kids?" I could never. I loved and supported my dad until we could no longer live together, and we had to go our separate ways. I said good bye to the man I used to know a long time ago, I love him but hes not the same man and that was his choice and I gotta make mine. I love you dad! ❤️ The day you lost your mind, I had a silent burial in my heart and soul and I shed dry tears as a looked into your lost eyes because you needed me to be strong for you because you smoked yourself silly. I love you but I had to let you go. 💔

Relatable 😢
Lies
Craziest part when the addiction is your own mind
Sober since 4/8/08 🎉
RIP my "seester"... I got your daughters til my last breath. I'm sorry I gave up on you and cut you off. It wasn't because i thought you were beneath me.. and it wasn't to punish you..... One of us had to get sober to take care of your kids. 😞😢
Good job t you did good

This song has and always will touch every emotion in me . Thank you Joyner for this song 💯💯💯
I hear you Son! I'm scared this will never end?
Yes, expressly if you have to ask…
You already know this is charting
I've never related to the word "FUCK" more in my life.
It's awesome not be reliant , I  don't want someone in my life, for Father God is my best 🙏 Friend and love😊❤😊❤I am here to help... with my whole 💓 heart and soul❤😊❤
Chills
If u don't believe in yourself you'll never believe in somebody believing in you
FACTS IM GOING Through it and it’s easy to blame it but it’s the last thing that makes me feel alive😒🤦‍♂️😢 I’ve lost soooo much and feel like a piece of 💩 letting my kids and wife and others down so I turn to the bottle but isn’t right. IM SORRY TO THE LORD AND ALL THAT LOVE ME. BUT ALMOST LOST MY LIFE CUZ OF THIS CRUTCH 😢🫵🤦‍♂️😭im stupid but everyone relies on me and I would never tell them how much I am disappointed in myself, but I guess it’s better than being 6 feet under Maybe🤷‍♂️🙏
I'm sorry to say this, I love jelly roll and all his music, but this is the most auto tuned vocals from him and it's obvious.. good song and all but that's not his voice.
My struggle and my strength...
My mom sent me this when I was addicted to pills a year ago, I’m now a year clean , you guys work wonders
Love this song.
3:04 those are dead ass real  generic norcos . Hydrocodone
I just want you to know that i use this song as a form of therapy at the rehab i work at. I plan on writing a book, and this song will be the opening chart. So wait up, youll be hearing from me soon asking how i can do this. Then send you your chapter. Recovery will be sining thia song for decades to come
My son also I was a addict 8 years clean wish he would learn
man this dude dont miss. nice collabo. keep bringin knowledge and pressure my boi
Shroomn on Joyner iz such an exquisite flight😂😂😂 I'm kumn Twin_Gettn stronger within in myself I'm sheddn these skins_ The envy Iz evolution been on the outside lookn in_unveiln this lethal weapon boy yall thought I was a blokk bully then.... ImSoKeykey
13 months 4 days off hard drugs I only smoke ganja and even though I got a treatable chronic disease I don't give up I live harder
Losing Pac n Big woild be like Kdot n Drake both murdered by being laced with Bullets, oriple don't understand we lost all time greats , but at the time they was the face, the viices, the forces of rap.Because Em mentions Suge's Bloods, this was too dangerous, Suge himself was a force, but mentioning his homies was war. Dre lost Eazy in '95, Knew even if Suge didn't have Pac killed, his beating of rival gang member Orlando Anderson eith his crew and Pac led to hid death, either way Suge held  some form of responsibility. Someone would have been at risk, a innocent/ non target could as easily died, this is top 5 Em for me  just lyrically and emotionally, Best Friend, Renegade, say goodbye to Hollywood, I am other 4 in top 5
hey lady, I hope some day u truly find happiness. I believe @ this version of u scares me. Ur using alcohol nd inside pain destroy the woman I came to know nd love. There are times when the mind is dealt such a blow that it hides itself in insanity. . . There are times when reality is nothing but pain. And to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind. U finally said we should move on. I told myself that when u said anything close to that I would walk away. I will always love u but I can't hold a hand that has a fist out. MHS❤
Rip the old me.... This song touched me heavy
@joynerlucasoffical NEEDED THIS ONE 💪💎💪
I had to force myself to unlove someone due to addiction because they would only believe the excuses they gave..  💔 and now our family is split and bruised.
This shit hits too hard
Man I feel like I’m spinning in circles and i don’t know what to do
this shit hits so hard
My whole life my parents have let drugs run them I’ve been raised by grandparents but I want to feel that love that other kids felt that bond that they don’t want with me 😢
This song touches my soul in a way that I can’t even put in words…trying to put it into words brings me to tears every time …..in 2010 when I was just 21 years old, I found my twin brother dead from an overdose.  My hope is for those who are fighting the fight,  that they somehow find peace, and also for all of the those who love them, and fighting a different fight alongside them, I hope that you can find it in your hearts to be able to give them the grace that they so desperately need and want. 💔
I am loosing that fight
Sa hurts frfr btw this Andrew still talking for mama aswhile 1:55 1:56 1:56 1:56 1:56 1:56 1:56 1:57
I have bars fo r this too
Shout to Joyner dog. That first verse is literally how I feel towards the love of my life. Man powerful.
songs hits differently when you got loved ones who fight with hard addictions ❤
What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul.
It's sad that inspirational songs like this gets no radio play.
Fireeeeeee this hit home
Recovering heroin addict of 12 years here, this song made me tear up… powerful lyrics, this is how I truly felt knowing those I love were trying to save me and I couldn’t even save myself… the times I felt alone and cried and begged for a way out and a new beginning, yet feeling so hopelessly trapped… so grateful for a second chance at life, a husband and boys who love me 💕❤️
Fuckin song broke me
I picked up a group of friends who all did drugs and drinking. Man, isn't it hard letting them all go .rather They passed, or I had to just let go .Im sober nothing but christ in me. i tried, but now  i just  carry their  ghost of what they were. Love them all. I had to do what's best for me.
I have been a secret addict for the last 10 years atleast, my mother died last summer without me getting the chance to come clean to her about everything. I'm still using today but I can feel the moment come closer everyday where I wake up wanting to stop for good. Hopefully soon - Thank you Joyner & Jelly for making a song that explains both sides perfectly.
I was a fentynal addict for over 5 years. When artist make music like this they know it helps but thet dont know how much it helps us. Music that  speaks on addiction the way this does.Is a go to for Parents, Siblings,Friends and Addicts. This song gives perspective on the loved ones side! The frustration and pain they suffer and feel and embarrassment and tears and worries all the dissappontment. Alot of addicts cant see this clear and cant think of the ones hurt from just watching you. Especially if its opiate addiction on any level. Done very well Lucas always spitting on life real world shit addiction and mental issues. Jelly always hit mfer in the heart with these types of songs......  I'm now 6 months clean..
This hits so hard❤️
Great collab but who's the other white dude? I stayed in a sober living home for a few years. I've had to narcan and save lives, I've also had to help remove bodies..... Shit was killing me to stay in the mix so I had to do what's best for me and make it on my own....
This is deep
Listening in 2025 🔥❤
I love your song  ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Held a gun to my head last week and not sure what stopped me. Lost everything I had last week cause of incident. Was an outcry for help and ended up with criminal charges and unable to be at my home. Our system is messed up. I wanted M1 hold but ended up with ankle bracelet and was let down as I only spent 2 minutes on computer with doc to clear me. I’ve now since enrolled in mental health. Been clean and sober since last September then has small relapse when stresses of life hit and I couldn’t handle it. We need to make a change in this country, our mental health system is a joke. They wanted me on meds but that’s just a bandaid, I need to forgive myself and learn to love that person in the mirror again. 😢
Im sorry i wasnt there for you teva 😢R.I.P my love 😢😢😢
Today I have 4 months 27 days clean and sober from a deadly 6 year fent addiction.. life is hard still but way better. I thank god I’m here
This song saved my life i hope it saves yours
The second verse 😢 i feel that shit for real
🥰🥰🥰 Wendy u look so beautiful ❤ ❤
Miss all my people
Praying everyday for my baby girl.  She is so lost , I am so afraid she will never come back.  I stay fast in praying.  It’s all I have left.
All the way from Malawi,Africa..this record is dope N it really helped me man🙏..Joyner you really killed it man
Addiction is the worst thing to deal with in this world it's not what u want to do but there's no way to let go when the only thing I want to do is that with no luck or results 😔😔😔
Love this song 🔥💯 I lost my dad to suicide whem i was 10. I went fown a path of addiction and prison thats how ive been living! I take care of my mama shes got cancer and i love her to death! Im trying to stay a float i oray for better days 🙏🏼💛💙🙏🏼
One of the TOP REALEST SONGS I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE. 4REAL!! HANDS DOWN IT SAID MY THOUGHTS AND TOLD MY STORY TOO AMEN GOD BLESS YA JOYNER IT SAVED MY LIFE LITERALLY TOO FACTS AMEN
Cries the first time I heard this and sent it to my sister who has been my rock and never turned her back on me. I am now clean for the first time since I started using and if not for her I honestly believe I would be dead. I love you big sister 🧡
Amazing
Summahan a vibe
I fell like this song was Joyner writing to himself, @joynerlucasofficial you sir are strength and can do what’s best for you
Lost my husband of 20 years March 9th. High school sweethearts, we had been together since we were 14. 26 1/2 years together. I hate addiction! I’ve lost too many loved ones to it.
nobody’s perfect “Not even Jooos” lmao yea they do think they are special don’t they
Almost cried
Absolutely  love this 😊 it will help man in both position ❤
❤❤❤😢❤❤❤
I'm still in active addiction...I want to be clean I'm stuck and just scared to be sober...I pray something will click soon
"How come you're only there for me when I'm trying to get clean?" Such a real line.
My son sent this to me before he died of drug overdose and he died
Dude its so fucking insane how Joyner tells us stories through music, this is more than art and the video completes it.
This one hit hard
Plp share things cause they can’t deal but some deal alone
#Milyz 🔥🔥 🔥
Real
"Best for me"😢
❤️
🙏❤️💪💯
My sister sent me this.... . I need to go to rehab. I miss my family so much... I miss loving life but I just hurt so badly....143
Joyner is #1 on my list of rapp...hang on not just rap, of all music!! Huge fan and if you actually listen to his lyrics he is a genius of music!!
Crap family curse. Father of seven and disabled and I get this completely. I was supposed to have open heart surgery and the hospital won't do my surgery because I have a few broken teeth so I'll just meet God soon.
I've got to say.this song is for people full of love.
My dad's this song
2:10 best vers
Joyner we miss you come back with another banger 😢
Joyner and Jelly on the same track is a literal gift the human race didn't deserve, but I'm so glad we got it.
I am going through this right now brother. I feel like this is where I am at, Im sober 4 months and 20 days. But WE can't communicate constructively.  I know there are always a middle ground to be found but everyone has to be open to getting there.
Cole, I'm not sure if this will reach you, but thank you for the second verse on this song. Thank you for having the voice some of us can't. You are amazing. God bless 🙏
Defending addiction??? Nah Just explaining it.  They need help, not judgment.
I heard this song the day it came out. I listened on repeat and I kept asking myself why I can't get clean like it wasn't that I didn't want to but literally the demon was absolutely bigger and stronger than me. Only 8 months and 21 days ago I went to rehab and have stayed sober. I now listen to this song and smile rather than  laying in the tub crying and begging for help.
lol
This song legit is my old story from 15 yrs ago. I’ve been clean for 10 years now. It’s possible for everyone if I made it out. Please seek help if you have an addiction
Love that Joyner still tells stories like back in the day when he dropped Ross Capicchioni
Love this ❤
Dam this song hard asf
My bro bday was april 7th hes strung out I spoke to him 1time in the past 5 months
Broo "speaking of God, how you know all the plans hes got for me" That verse should touch any addict fighting for sobriety that has family members judging them, assuming your life is over and that your never prosper or overcome the battle. Dont do it for them, dont do it to simply brag, do it for yourself and your worth. Just cause your in the hole now doesn't mean god wont toss you a rope to pull yourself out. But if u expect for him to pull u out, youll be stuck forever. Watch the signs people. And yes, im speaking from experience. If you want change, no excuses!!!
My brother sent me this song a year ago when it came out around the same time my addiction became apparent I cried all night and now for the first time in my 26 years I signed up for rehab and leave tomorrow but failure is not a option
😢😢
Does somebody to laugh for but I did the drugs but I hope they feel better by Jesus God cause I hope when y’all die one day y’all go to heaven thank you jelly roll. I’m thinking to roll a jelly roll. OK have a nice day. I hope you, God I hope y’all be saving your life from God in Jesus and from the devil because the devil always always here to kill he hit kill doing destroy doodle wanna be like him don’t you?😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 😇😇😇😇😇🥰🥰🙂‍↔️😿😿🙌😿😿😿🙌
Love you brother 💕
5 years 🎉still just one more day
song hits hard as fuck
#john3:16
#wannawork @jellyroll

Lost my cousin...😢 half a year older than me, we grew up close. Like siblings... she passed a year ago... song reminds me a lot of her. Feel guilty because i feel like i should/ could have tried harder to steer her the right way.
Great soung I feel it

Fire fire
this song hits home, these lyrics really do hit different if you know you know
This song proves the world is trash…art like this gets 24mill views in 1 year but lil pump can get 1 billion views saying nothing …wake up ratards
Still cant dance, still hasnt hired chris brown as his choreographer after that battle lol
I have a drinking problem and I want to escape that… when I’m been drinking I like to listen to this song
So many in my family are addicts including my father and it breaks my heart I can’t help him. I had to let him go…. But I broke generational curses in my family and I’ve never touched a drug or drank a drop. And my 4 kids will never feel this pain I have felt! Thankful For GOD!!
I lost my child's father last Thursday  I dedicated this to him when I finally gave up. I hope you all fight your demons and you win ❤
This song is everything.
I’m at work right now sitting in my car just thinking about the alcohol weed vape my stomach hurts and I’ve been doing all that for the last few years every single day so I’m gonna try to stop all that today so if anyone can pray for me, that would be nice I can use all the prayers I can get
Can you love someone so much you should leave? Dr’s give me all the reasons to stay addicted and it only hurts everyone around me. I’m pleating to did I can change. I want a baby, and I want to be there. But… she won’t quit. I can’t break her heart. I’m making her suffer while I try to change and just fail.
Damn, jelly rolls voice made me tear up a little bit tbh, I can feel the pain in his voice
This shitt hit home
I've loved an addict for 10 years. It's been absolute hell. I've sacrificed my heart, my finances, my possessions, my job, my freedom and my mental health.   I also became an addict through the course of things but jail forced me back into sobriety. I've been betrayed by everything and everyone over these years and I feel like I'm not on the planet most days. I'm currently 4 months sober and I'm still fighting for both of our sakes. I have severe mental health problems/trust issues and I just wanna know if there's anyone out there willing to pray for us.   I feel like one of the only ones who ever wanted us to get clean together. I'm currently in a sober living home and seeking therapy and counseling for a lifetime of trauma and loss and betrayal. I wish I loved myself as much as I love her. I never learned to let my loved one go.   Maybe things would have been different. Maybe we could have been different. Or maybe it was meant to be a sad story all along. I will remain sober. I can't speak for my partner.   If you love an addict. Your not alone.
93 days being sober. 😊 I'm on meth and heroin I (speedballing) it's hard being sober but .I love being sober 21 years of being f***** up....
My lil bro send me this I decided to live longer
how can you love someone,and let them go.🎉❤ but why keep playing victim😮

You know what pisses me off is that the alcohol companies will promote their s*** day in and day out an alcohol is worse on your body then opiates, cocaine, and most other drugs. But the government wants everybody to get hooked on alcohol which will kill your liver instead of giving people what they need
I felt this so hard.
This songs so good i relapsed so i could feel it again.
It's hot because for so long I was the one labeled as a drug addict my wife that was given the pain script for oxycodone oxycontin was sitting there feeding them to me making it okay
Joyner & Jason, you both saved me from addiction & homelessness & my brother who I raised who is autistic.. we both got hooked on dope at a young age at different times by different family members.. we lost my granny going on 3 years ago next month.. I feel so close to relapsing every time around this year since.. I’ve got going on 4 years sobriety from meth & life is getting better slowly but surely.. thank you for your guys woke music.
Hate how the second verse was the adict turning the problem of addiction back on the non user and telling him that he's playing the victim. However, I also hate how some parts of the second verse was right. If were going to support someone, we support them unconditionally, but sometimes we can't because it drains us of our energy, watching an endless cycle of self sabotage. Makes me wonder how God's loves us even when we look him in the eyes and continue to make the wrong choices😢 both sides are valid in a way, and it sucks having zero influence power or control over the addiction from both sides of the spectrum.
I just got out of rehab im in a recovery house now with 41days clean this song hits me hard
1 love in help now anyone no answer me
I on pills now I hard this song now I'm changing everything I'm it time thank you
Omg 😢😭😭💔💔😭😭💔💔😭
It will forever make me feel like I belong
I'm only 36 I'm tired of being tired😅 I've been on heroin since I was 22 crack cocaine since I was 26 I'm fed up every time I hear this song I get into it so into it it describes my daily life I struggle everyday but I'm still here there must be a reason time for a change
🔥🔥🔥🤙🏻
Finally a real rap song❤ just now finding this banger
txs for this song real hip hop still alive
I love this song. Being a former addict myself and my drug of choice was fentanyl. I'm lucky I'm not dead but I did leave my husband of 16 years to a fentanyl overdose which scared me straight. I'd probably be dead too so he saved my life. I'm going on 3 years and 8 months clean and sober
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😃😃😃😃😃💀💀💀💀💀
This hit so hard for me I took the incentive to go to rehab on my own for drinking joyner this so much motivation for me I appreciate and love you made this song salute to you 🔥💯
Please just try you will see that you can be free  remember life is precious
Dogs will agree if they are truly loyal= Replacing all your dogs at the same time is better protection. Monthly is better, but yearly is good. Thinking they could hide behind some, Flush out them snakes. DONT LET THEM TRAIN THEM.
This song was my life growing up and now I'm an adult dealing with the harsh reality of addiction 😔 it's literally taken half of my family and working on the other half ,sbt Real Talk 💯
This song hit me like a ton of bricks I have a really bad dependency and problem with cannabis like I can smoke anywhere between four or five splits a day or more and I was trying to get clean for my best mate of 10 years and then I relapsed on a particular day because of personal reasons that I can't go into it wasn't good enough for him and it was like he only wanted to be in my life and I was trying to get clean of cannabis but why should I f****** bother now when he's f***** me off out of  his life why should I  I was doing so well with him in my life but now I'm not I was trying my f****** damn hardest but like I said what's the f****** point now this song is really f****** powerful this is my ultimate favourite song of all time thank you Joyner Lucas for making this song with jelly roll you two are legends you know what people are going through thank you from a fan from North London United Kingdom Great Britain England
Im detoxing rn...i had to leave him ..he won't change..but its not for me ..this shit sucks ..i was clean a year n fucxed it all up..but its ok .we all can get better if we just put in the work and go through the pain..its a few days detox for the restof ur life to be a life ❤❤❤❤ praying for us all 🙏💞
If you guys keep being strong I will too 🙏❤️
Man... this song is so deep.
You and Tone Levels need to do a colab...
Saddest part i never was one for drugs or alcohol. Grew up with my father being on both always said i would never do them... tried my first time when i was 18 didnt do it again till i was in my early 30s after 3 months of being with someone i didnt know was an addict until i caught him. It entered my life as quick as i lost everything in 3 months because i was on his path. We seperated and later got back together married and stayed sober over 2 years relapsed for 3 months. Been sober 2 weeks now. People deal with their trauma in certain ways and try to live in the moment. Truth is ... living in those moments cost so much and myself. Im picking myself up again and starting a new date. There is always hope and anyone battling addiction can overcome it. Surround yourselves with positivity  and stay on the higher path. We got this ❤
I can say that where i live in Virginia and the racism is real!!! DJT is a evil man and people will see soon what happens when a false profit and his cult take over. I hate politics it turns people against each other. DJT isn't going to help us poor and disabled people, best believe that..I'm sick of the hatred in this country. People are going to keep marching until we have a civil war again. Well that explains everything. I'm a disabled white woman and being poor is considered white trash here. Yes America was always great but watch what happens. Just look at the stock market, groceries, gas prices. The evil man don't give a crap about anyone but himself..😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Im only here for jelly rolls part
you konwthis song is about my mom
Shit ain’t easy forsure but I’m glad I got out…
I cannot stop watching this video. The actor that lip -syncs the second verse is an AMAZING element to bring the story of the song to life. Just so goddamn good!!!
What do you mean I never targeted you I already told you be where you want to be be who you want to be and be f****** grateful
And you got your f****** nerve little boy so that's why you and her called the cops on me I'm not asking anything I'm not going anywhere whether you guys f****** like it or not I'm here and I'm not going anywhere
You guys never cared anyway why you care now
I never denied anything bubba
Life got too deep for him and he chose the easy way out
How is this a acoustic? It needs to be renamed !!!
Good job
damn joyner you got one with this one
damn as an addict this shit hits
This sh*t firee fr don't see how it ain't but just now getting around everywhere
This has to be the best song I've ever heard about addiction, it tells both sides of the story, the addicts side and the suffering family members side, I've never heard a song that does that, as a past pain pill addict, it was awesome that the addicts feelings were shared in this song, this song deserves a Grammy for real!!!!!
I'm 20 years, I'm addicted to meth, heroine, weed, and alcohol  I started at 15yrs old and I'm trying to stay clean Everytime i stay clean for like 2-3month i still see myself fall into the same position  I'm trying, and I'm having suicide thought  I hate myself evn more. I just wish i could just die. I'm tired 😭😭😭💔
On April 15th I will be sober for a year! God bless everyone ❤
I lost the love of my life behind my addiction. I only hope that she realizes 1 day how much she means to me still to this day. I pray that she comes back to me 1 day and I can right my wrongs
This song has hit hard on my  heart since I first heard it. But right now it hurts so bad... I just found out my dad died yesterday...his addictions consumed him. I always knew it would happen but you truly can never prepare for that phone call 💔
If you feel this song believe me you’re worth it!!!  Greatings from the Netherlands.  I was in a depression for 10 years I’m now 30.  So I missed 10 years of my life kinda.  But i feel like I’m worth every minute of the day now!!  Blessed you❤
💰
Love it
I feel this one in my soul. Anyone who's been through this with a loved one, has lived it. I pray that anyone dealing with addiction finds sobriety before death.
Lost my dad to his addiction a month ago, 2/18/25. He checked himself out of the hospital and was found alone in a motel 6 two days later. I had to go there to collect his belongings and could see where his body was laying on top of the made bed next to a razor blade and straw. I’m so fucking angry.
This deep
Hi it's #TaraRizzor my phone is broke
Close to my soul rite here about to hang it up after this shit
Found this in detox got 7 days clean from that fucking devil fent if I can do it anybody can promise that
Watching this hits SO HARD. loosing someone you love to addiction is one of the hardest things to go through. I don't wish it on nobody. Lost my little brother in 2018 to heroin. And I wish to this day he would have pulled through it. 23 years old. No kids, never married. Life cut short so soon. Hug your people's bc tomorrow is NEVERA promised
Health is important
I lost 2 people I loved so much who chose their drugs, and now they're gone for good and it's too late.  I wished so desperately I could have saved them.  I miss them ecru Damn day!  Thank you for your song. 😢
Don’t make me cry
13 years clean on june 6th, 2025
Is the same house from the suicide song? Are the videos connected?
🎉🎉🎉🎉💥💥💥💥💥bothel deli
Growing up me and my family were homeless we were never stable I'm the oldest of 4 i always had to be the parent my parents put there addictions first all i want is for them to get clean and be parents for my sisters so they don't have the pain i carry
Thank you so much, brothers, thank you.
Wow thank You Brothers 🔉
This is a beautiful song.. Can't listen without crying.. i got clean last June and never thought I'd go a single day without masking my pain with poison..i should be dead 1,000%  But now i can be there for my son and give him all of his mom.. I'm about to have a baby girl in April and never thought I'd be here with hope in my heart. Thank you everyone!
No bad words please
I love this! OMG Thanks to the ARTISTS. Thank you...
My Sister.   I miss our life together. I still pray you’ll over come before it takes you.
Love this song!
I tell you I love you in case you don't hear it enough mannnn
This song hurt me, I didn't have nobody to support me or who was really there for me I put myself in rehab and I'm very proud to say I've been clean ever since. This is a beautiful song we are enough.
If you're reading this, remember you're beautiful and I love you despite never meeting you.
Beautiful song beautiful song I'm sitting in your legs in a tent. Never think that I get to this level so low, I'm missing my wife my son everything good in life. And I trust in God to take me away from here😊
As a foster mom with kiddos who have been through this, and my own family… this hits hard 😭
Meer van dit soort videos! En gefeliciteerd en succes bij je nieuwe job
Only those that have been there and still there understand I wish those that are well now n love those that are still fighting addiction
This hits so different for me right now i will never take for granted what i have but to be thankful for myself is a whole different battle and it really feels like im going to lose that one but things like this song pushes me further and for that i appreciate you and know if it helps me it helps so many others
Im 27 and im going through this...
Feb. 24th 2000 lost 1 of the best cousins' and best men I ever met !  overdosed on herion in a place , that was meant to help him ,  his twin brother is still broken ! to all you addicts , its not worth it , get off the shit , don't ruin another family like mine , We still miss you like crazy cousin ! Crazy thing is my family just saw him , hours before he died , including his Mother ! ❤❤❤
Love it. As a 25 plus year Heroin addict this speaks to me

Ok but why is nobody talking about how good of an actor that guy is
We are all just parts of our love remember that!💪
❤❤❤❤💪
Man you are on another level rip sadhu
Never heard jelly roll sing like that. Sounded fucking great
All my life I waited to get married (I'm 49). October 18th I found her. My dream come true and I fucked it off😢
Im currently losing My brother to fentanyl. Hes died and been brought back a few times. Ive tried to get thru to him and ive tried to just be there for him but im terrified the next call or the last call will be the final call.
@Joyner, I relate with this track man
This sucker punched me right in the face, and it's only morning. Crying like a baby bro♡
Dam! Amazin
I love how when Joyner does songs like this he shows both sides of the story. The way someone feels about the addiction and how the addict feels about the criticism. They know they aren't well they don't need a constant reminder especially from someone they know that loves them. Remember once you give up there isn't a fight just a wait for the news. It sucks I wish my bro just would change so I can see him once again. But he just chose the drugs over what can and would be.
The sincerity and honesty imbued in these lyrics are beyond "moving" for me. Joyner breathes life and death into his verses with his immaculately articulate and powerful flow, while Jelly staggers my soul with his vocal control, finesse, and raw emotion in the chorus. Thank you, gentlemen, for this sonic gift and reminder of our sovereign right to do what is best for ourselves in tough situations.
Black folks gone get upset with deez white folks steppin on rap
Joyner this song has touched my life in a million ways, this song made me cry many times im almost 4 years clean, and i always play this as a reminder that my worst day clean is better than my best day high❤❤❤
I Pray that All Addictions and Addicts be healed, delivered, set free in the Name of Jesus Christ.
This song hits deep in my soul
I sent this to my bro and he ignored me. What hopes do I have left in getting him to become clean?
If you read this today. Youre enough ❤
Just got me emotional..... Going through, what I'm going through right now....
TRG ❤
A song from a celebrity actually doesn't help a real addict sorry to say,if it were only that freaked ng eazy
Sa paye pas bin votre affaire MC Donald sa paye mieux
Pronounced (Gone) his first name is Luke that's why he did the Star Wars bars Luke vs Darth Vadar Parkside. His full name is Luke Gawne
Trying so hard to get back where i was 😭
We need a song with Justin Bieber and jelly roll
I hope I beat my addiction one day. I just want to be me again...
This song hits hard. Having been clean for 7 years now it goes deeper than it sounds on the outside. When I got clean I met “the love of my life” or so I thought, turns out it was just another narcissist with their next prey in their grasp. The divorce took 2 years but I won the custody battle which was all I had ever focused on. Everyone close to me was so worried that I would fall back into old habits but there’s no way I could ever go back to old habits when I have someone who loves and needs me more than I need myself. I got clean for me and only me and now I actually have a reason to stay that way and I thank god every single day for that. The divorce was brutal and left me unrecognizable, I still don’t feel the same but I push through effortlessly every single day for my son, if anyone didn’t deserve what happened it was him. That’s the most painful part about all of this and that kid holds every last piece of what’s left of my heart and no one else will ever even see a piece of it till the day I die. Sorry for rambling on but thank you for listening if you made it this far, I appreciate it more than you’ll ever know ❤
😳🥺  OMG..... THIS HIT HOME‼️😇🙏💯
2025❤
Lost my dad to Xanax pills I was 14 I used to cry to him and beg him to stop but he never did he was 28 this song hit me hard
This song hurts me so much i cried and begged my mom for change and she did and died i didn't really get to see it but now I'm the one on the other side 😢
Man, jellyroll is just awesome. Does this guy even have a bad song?
Joyner snap on this track,  too real ❤
I am the second verse an I want to stop this life I hate being a disappointment to my family and want my brother to hug me and say I love you I wish
I lost the love of my life and I stopped using meth and percocet and when I finally got clean she came back to me and I told her not to come back to me if she was going to leave again unless I truly didn’t deserve her or if she just deserves better. She swore she understood and we started couples therapy and before we could make it to the second meeting she told me she didn’t want to be with me anymore and that she doesn’t trust or believe me. I knew better and now I relapsed again all that progress out the window and my love loyalty integrity n willingness to do whatever it took to show her I was a good man for her. I don’t want to live anymore but I’m too scared to kill myself so this time I’m just going to get as high as I can n hope that it killa me. This world and all you people in it are fickle and everything is easy come easy go I have never struggled with the thought of wanting to keep on keeping on in my life so the fact that I’m here now shows me that it’s my final curtain call
Each to their own but fuck drugs. Load of false happiness and chemical reality which will never be a true reality💯any body who's not touched them, don't🤘
Not just an anthem but a message to the many that don't have anyone to talk to or feel abandoned. Theirs someone out there ready to listen to you.
Kristy the devil z who is zirus apodaca the antichrist and junior who is rick cabajas son been rapping people in my family little boys and girls and those kids mother they are being destroyed love the holy spirit

Zirus apodaca who is the antichrist and christy apodaca is the devil is being destroyed god over and out
Kristy apodaca is the devil and her son zirus apodaca is the antichrist FBI agent head of the military special ops and head of the family and also God who is me gina they are being destroyed
This gives me the same vibes as that Wiz song
This is powerful
As a recovering addict this hit me on so many different levels 😭💯🙏
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
My cousin heard this while we was at her mates & started apologising to me but now she's 6months of crack & meth
This video is fire, shit almost made me fire
My sister is on crack and every time I remember her, I think of our childhood memories. She’s my big sister, and I’d always lay my my life down for family, but she did her things, and it’s hard to not let her into my home to help her when she’s going through demons, but I gotta do what’s best for me. Joyner never fails.
Just sitting here listening on repeat wondering why I made out but my brother and my best friend are still stuck all these years later
My daughter sent this to me and it reminds me of me. I am in Residential treatment now and hopefully it works this time.
Hope you understand why we work together to show each other the good in them
I am a recovering addict from all drugs I have been in the same place this songs speaks about and by the grace of God and prayers I made it out…if you have someone you love that is an addict keep fighting for them when they are lost in addiction they have to have a light it’s so dark in the rooms of addiction…keep fighting for them….in jesus name amen
Man, this song cuts deep every time I hear it!
That's incredible 😮❤
Damn em with save me and now Joyner with this and both with jelly roll

Awesome song Tom! I❤it.  keep up the good work 🎉
21 months and 4 days! I’m 44 it’s the longest I’ve ever been clean, this song helps me understand my son’s anger. I don’t know how he feels all the time but slowly things are getting better ❤
Im a drunk.  This song hits hard.  I need to do better, but I dont know how .   I wish i had someone who loved me b4 my thoughts get me.   Im a dead man walking.
In jesus' name i pray for him
Music 🎶 like videos 😢

♉ Hi I ❤️ NY 🍕♉🍻♉🇺🇸🛡️ Taurus 🐂
❤ 1:32
My son died from fentanyl I cant stand the regret of not savin him…. Broken…
This song really hits addiction on the head.
I love will , and Joyner . They sound alot alike lately since Joyner made his way into bad boy 4 js .. song is 🔥 tho😂
Joyner God has a plan and purpose for you, and it's got nothing to do with your own glory... he loves you more than you know
I used to do pain pills for like 2 years pretty much everything but heroin  and then wanted to get off and went on to Suboxone through a doctor and was so hard to get off but u won't succeed unless they really want to get clean for themselves not for someone else and I'm 5 years clean and still think about drugs when I go through tough stuff in life but I found God snd I call my preacher when I get that feelng but it's super hard and a long fight to get and stay clean not as easy as people think like just quit it's easy but it's not easy
Mr Joyner sir  I have a podcast  called "arena of ideas" in there the ideas are everyone else's ideas I use to create the episodes. I have a episode called mood swings  a awareness exercise on suicide,depression,anxiety and ptsd. 38 places to listen and 64 episodes on anything , everything  and all things.

Grewt song message and colab. Look to make a great song they say you must lose a piece of yourself. A pound of flesh if you will. The great part is that i was just listening and this masterpiece showed up! If you get a chance there is a song called ghost by the band badflower. This song hit me like that one did! Its about suicide.  A very deep song on the level of the soul just like this one!!!! Rock on music fam!
All ì can say is thank you😢
Cameron
Mel&cam4 life I love u my love😢 sorry I had to go .........
DAMN Brittani!.....................
Yepppppppppppp excuses TRUTH WITH AN ADDICT MYSELF IT'S ABOUT BEING REAL IT'S ALL A F****** CHOICE
"If it's not an addiction then why has it gotten to me" i love both of these artists but Joyner really has my heart forever . ♥️
D-O-P-E!!! 🔥🔥🔥
@CLRBruceRivers please listen to this praying for you and your family
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
No matter how many times I listen to this song, I still cry every time.
Yes you can.   When the pain and trauma to stay, is more than the pain and trauma to leave. When you have a son and you KNOW he's got the addiction gene.  And you feel like shit bc you always said y'all a team.  But was y'all REALLY a "team"? .... They laid in bed while you sold your soul. Lied and said they love you till you get old.  Praying to wake up and it'd be a dream.  When you grew up, you didn't plan on becoming a fiend.  But now you there, and the street are mean.  You wanna get out. Ain't got 1 hope 1 dream.  You send out a prayer, ..hoping it gets seen.    😂😂😂 You can laugh at me, it's ok.. 😂😂😂  #ShitThatShouldHaveStayedInDrafts     😂😂
😭😭😭😭
This is it The one Watch   It's going bro
💯
This dude music is so introspective
Damn this hits hard man specially after I lost almost my family to drugs too 😮‍💨 but I'm still maintaining 💯
😂😢😮😅😊 i don't know how to feel about that. Some chick's think what they're doing is a flex. Migrants making cArTeL money off ebt/dhs and American people who try get to pay for free loaders
addiction got to my mother, miss her everyday wish i could see her again. This song hits hard. Love this song brother
Ten months ago i commented how  my struggle was, well im here now 8 months sober and clean and if i can turn a crazy life around to something positive and happy, then nobody should ever give up their battle. This song was the start of the journey. Thanks jelly roll and joyner for this heart gripping bangger
Love joyner Lucas alot and got 1 year off pills so this is perfect
I love this song, I can relate to this
1 thing I love Joyners part as well as Jelly Roll...BUT the Victim Hood Mentality coming from us Addicts is a Joke and WE as a whole and group has to change!!! I see more addicts now in Pittsburgh in 2025 than I did in the 90's...SMDH get ya life back yall now! Love & Blessings
Powerful SONG. Lost my 36-year-old son to fentanyl in 2017.You don't how much this sounds like us the last year of his life. There were two people in these conversations, but I only saw one side. Mine. I couldn't let go. I just didn't understand. Now I do.
15 months sober it’s been hard because I gotta do my best to take care of my family but my old friends still tug at my heart
That someone you need to love is yourself. How can you love yourself without letting them go…😔
Dam this is hella deep 🤯 everyone got baggage and a  past a story we just all tryna find out where we are going
This !! ❤
I use to play this for my brother, ex marine suffering ptsd, now its for myself.......i lost myself helping everyone else and not myself.....now i dunno how to help myself and everyone left.......  Fk me , just dont lose yourselves..... if you have kids ....just think for them....i fucked up bad....
Damn Dax another fire of a song. Made my hair on my neck stand up. Thank you!
Everyone should be senting this to they friebd husband daughyer mom uncle wjatwver thats addicted
Lose weight or face tatoo? Face tatoo baby, all day!
God bless Joyner locas ❤ Deep in my heart 😢
😭💔🫂
i lost my bestfriend to drugs :( this hits home
I’m 4 years clean on March 5th. But unfortunately my brother will have been gone 5 years April 10th.  If you are struggling with addiction, please get help now. Do not wait. Do not convince yourself you can make it another day living that life. Free yourself. Get clean. My brother is no longer here to be able to get clean. It took him. And I couldn’t save him. It was too late. Don’t let it be too late for you.
My favorite artist right now. Teddy's sounds is refreshing and appreciated. And this song is 🔥🔥🔥
Anyone here in 2025?
Learn to Let Go!
me and mom gonna fix it,come get us !
Ofcourse id be the 420 thousand like 😅
whats crazy is im a week into getting clean haven't looked up anything addiction wise, I'm a fan of joyner. I haven't heard this song until today. ty joyner jelly.
you really do make amazing music that can touch the soul and mind :3 Also vibe to :3
my papa is laying in the hospital rn dying from his long battle with drugs im angry and sad just feeling every emotion honestly but I pray he find peace with his soul before he lets go 😣 my whole family fights these battles and it has destroyed a lot of love a lot of us dont speak to eachother anymore if you are struggling with addiction and read this please do self work you are strong you are worth it you are enough ❤️❤️
God  I you love  🔥🔥🌪️💥☄️🪐
This one hit me hard ❤
I know this song is technically about drug addiction, but I feel like most people can relate to it in many different forms. For example, I relate to this, but for me it feels like me talking about my husband and him talking to me, even though he is not an addict. Thank you for this masterpiece  🙏
Should’ve won a Grammy. ❤
Joyner u will always be iconic to me...ive fw u 4 yrs and more yrs 2 come G salute
I ❤ the people getting clean 💪🏼 keep going! Praying for strength for all
God this shit still makes me cry, I’m trying to detox off fentanyl and I hope I make it.
this shit dope as fuck
Dam Sad🔥🔥🔥
This not winning a Grammy is absolute robbery. Keeping it raw and real isn't for everybody but it's the story we didn't know we all need. #stayblessed #tooraw
Remember who you were. Remember who WE were... 😢
joyner… my gf just gave herself a ‘hot dose’ last night bro. she has 2 young kids. and now she is in a medically induced coma for at least the next three days. your music has gotten me through soooooooo much mental/emotional stuff since the day i heard keep it 100 for the first time. dude. it is sooooo hard to tow the line and continue tibe the ‘good sober dad’ but i’m gonna give the world a big f.u. and stay doing the good thing cause i got three beautiful iids of my own and she has two that i may have to help raise ‘without her; anymore. what a s4ittie year so far.
This is so personal to me since I've heard it it's gotten me through a lot and still getting me through my battle
I recently lost my son to suicide,  now I feel this down deep in my soul
💔💔💔💔
This song has given me cold chills literally from head to toe. I live in Ga. Same town the shooting happened in September of last year. My son is in high school and i melted outside the high school that day. This song hits my heart so hard, it beautiful!
"I'M REALLY FEELING THIS," GOD BLESS 🙏🏽🤲🏽🖤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤U& YOURS ALWAYS 🙏🏽🤲🏽❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Been listening to this since it came out , just a fire song
I’m sitting here grieving my relationship due to drug addiction 4 years lost I can’t believe I found the love of my  life and I lost him to addiction 3 years in I’m truly heart broken 💔
Dude is a problem...
Very powerful song brings me to tears each time I hear it.
Thinking about you homie aj🕊️😢
Wish more artists would speak up about this. It a huge issue in some many peoples lives. Jelly Rolls music has helped me so much.
The GOAT!
So REAL.
God I love this music he makes it really hits the hart and so true😊 keep up the great work  thank u so much for the time
I'm sitting in rehab crying right now. I can say this place truly changed my life. Listening to this song is like looking at a mirror that reflects my past self. It made me cry, realizing all the damage I inflicted to the ones I love. In addiction, we're too selfish to realize it hurts the ones we're closest to. I have many ammends to make, but first, I have to make ammends with the man in the mirror. If anyone reads this, I wish you well on your road to recovery. YOU ARE WORTH IT. YOU MATTER. YOU GOT THIS. DONT GIVE UP. THIS IS LIFE OR DEATH. PLEASE LOVE YOURSELF ENOUGH TO ALLOW YOURSELF TO RECOVER. YOUR FAMILY NEEDS YOU. YOU NEED YOU. I LOVE YOU. MUCH BLESSINGS TO YOU ✊🏾🗣
❤👂🏿👂🏿👀🙏🏿🔝✅🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤯
Love this song
I'll do 10 pushups for each like....
Crying my eyes out just lost my cousin yesterday to drugs
This was tantamount to me starting the journey of recovery. Not sure the context of hiw he wrote it but speaks to the war within me.
Son Sebastian Moana 🕯️ Get Well ❤️‍🩹 2025 love ur Mom
This song is deep deep it hits the soul!
I know you been calling for me, you hitting my phone, but ive been alone, so im harder to reach. I hate when these demons get into my soul 😒
You got this brother we've been the same place.....stay strong 💪 💯 ❤️
2:44 this dude hairy enough to be the next wolverine
I'm surprised this doesn't have more views than it does😮
Are u there because I need  and ps only thing I do know is somke 💚 and cigarettes  so tell u I've been there
Anyone can do absolutely anything AS LONG AS THEY HAVE THE TOOLS TO. Hands and feet are not enough in this world and some need help. We are who we are from life experiences. If ppl could choose to be raised right and get there needs met they would.
I love your music joyner and im addicted to drugs
Anyone still listening in 2026?
your music makes me cry
I'll do 100 for everyone that likes it while on mushrooms

Jellyroll cringy lipsync acting really ruins his words imo 🤷
It fills like me...
Jelly roll appearing on every cool artist feature and mgk too jk he ok
Why that body laying down look like @slimshady
This song means a lot to me. 4 years clean off heroin/fent but still struggling with my mental and spiritual health. As my physical strength returns still more all the time, the other 2 are in free fall. Wasn't supposed to be this way. But so long as I'm still standing on my own two feet, there's time.
Bruh, I was casually listening to bro, while smoking a cigarette, and I guess when the lyrics registered, my eyes instantly watered and I exhaled deeply like something extremely heavy was tryna get off my chest for the longest and it finally did. Bruh, what the actual fuck? This song tapped into my subconscious, i wasn't even aware. Wow. Wow. Now this is what music should me. Make you feel things. Wow. I'm honestly in shock.
Lost my sister to fentanyl addiction. Idk how to go on honestly. Im lost completely
Alcoholic here.. to this day I still feel like this song is about me. I want to be better to my friends and to myself but it's hard for many reasons. My life isn't in shambles but I know I'm not living healthy. This song makes me feel heard and want to keep fighting the good fight 💪
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Needs to be taken out to the wood shed. She’d shake everytime she seen a wal mart from then on
Roseanne I grew up watching your show and i loved it. It was more about real family struggles! I will stand behind you they treated you so bad! I refuse to watch the show without in it!
Not even joking rn this song made my hands shake
I love you baby❤
Amazing song but I feel like jelly roll should have had a rap verse in it instead of just the hook
2 years clean and i listen to this song everyday
Deep deep Love you both I think I spotted Jelly in Augusta last years Seems like a cool dude  Did you know we host The Masters there every April its a holiday week practically 😂❤
The question long weighed on me, I found the answer for me was that you have to love yourself above all else and sometimes making decisions for yourself is most important.
Jan25 2025 Most underrated song ever🥺💔🤝
Joyner Lucas please keep making music. I love it.
Wow.. what a great song..
Love u gave Lito, buck and stak props at the end.. Real rappers
If Joyner isn't the goat he's the goat in training. Tell me who else has crafted the art of telling both sides in lyrics or lyricising the rough parts of EVERYONE'S lives and obstacles like him... I'll wait
This deep I felt this ❤
Where the hell has this song been and why haven't I heard it!!!
denial excuses believe fulfill your destiny
I've not cried so hard....oh God..
GOD ISNWITH EVERY SINGLE 1 OF YALL JUST BELIEVE IN HIM AND REPENT GIVE UR LIFE TO THE LORD
I felt this …
I'm most impressed with the guy who was rapping talking to joyner in the house who was battling drug  addiction.  That's not easy.  He remembered every lyric.
Lost my brother in November to drugs! We became distant because I didn’t wanna see him destroy himself I was always there for him and he was there for me I miss my big brother 😭
Jesus is king
my fiancee and I were addicted to crack and fent, and alcohol now we are 11 months clean and almost 5 year anniversary

Raise reminds me of my meth head brother he's been addicted since 2017 and we don't talk and wish I could see him but he's not the same and it eats my soul apart I just want my old brother back I have no dad and he's the only one who can be a good Influence on me cuase I need some one to lean on and trust but there's no one
That should say I love your song, not smoking. I would use the microphone😂😂
❤❤❤ I love your smoking. I am a former fentanyl addict myself. I lost my husband in 16 years to a fentanyl overdose June 17th 2021. When that happened it scared me straight. Instead of going further into addiction I got clean and sober hardest thing I ever had to do because I had to really feel the feelings then instead of trying to use drugs to cover up the pain. But I got through it and I'm now doing great. I'm no longer homeless. I have my own place. I'm clean and sober by that having it. He truly saved my life R I P Shine forever 61 💜 Love and miss you shine you would be proud of me. I made it out of addiction alive. Not many do that like they say jail's institutions in death but in jail many of times. Thank God I never went to prison
Respekt Alpa aus dem Pott!! Weiter so
This was so good.  Rosanne you have always been the best… and girl, you look damn good! Great song Tom!
Fabricate the next vessels story line already. Aready got HD of my next vessel..   Can't wait to see what you guys have in store for me. Hopefully I don't have to RIp this continent into 2 pieces. It would really break my soul, notice I didn't even mention what it would do to my heart. It's the continent.
I feel every word 😢
They don't realize how lonely and hard it is to be a man. There is no one there when you need to talk, no one there when you feel depressed.
Don't let me get up early don't let me go brother don't let me go brother I don't want to go with you😅😅😅😮😢😢😮😮😮😢😮😢🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Joyner is elite at telling a story and showing perspectives with his music. Incredible. The rap and response in this song is insanely good.
I think it’s time to throw in the towel man has it been a fight …. 💔
Cctv
It's crazy just got out of hospital today I overdosed from something I knew could kill me but yet I still got high and played with death everyday  Was in a coma for almost 2 weeks  Sitting here listening to this song  I'm scared as shit  I'm sitting here wanting to get high.....but I know I almost died  But yet I still crave that evil shit
Chester never new ...or maby he. .did ...either way...we love u bra ...and never will forget u  thank u for your messages in this life ...and after...I'll c u one day
Listen you are the ones that believed a book written by man that said I was perfect in the flesh. I told you it was a lie. They did that to make you doubt. I flipped tables, I told off Rabbi’s calling them hypocrites and if I was so perfect back then why did I need to hide! I’m no monster or servant of the dark ones. But IAM the ones who does battle for my fathers will not theirs. They say free will I say thy will not theirs or yours be done! If you know scripture true scripture you’ll get you have your free will but to serve thy will not your own first. Sin comes from putting the father second. Grace love forgiveness comes from putting the will of the father first and priest lie. They call themselves father, they are not, theirs but one father blessed mother of the more beings. So let me tell you this, if you put my father’s will first and walk with me I’ll make sure you meet my father. If your put your own will first and forget my fathers will I’ll forget you on the day of judgement in forgiveness called the book of life. No man no woman Joe child should perish. But if you refuse the father’s will and live as a heather with no obedience you are setting your name in stone. Not in the ink as light as the feathers quill! If you think you can deny me and I won’t deny you you’re absolutely wrong. I will not introduce even one soul to my father that denies him or denies me! Sometimes judgement is harsh and sometimes losing is winning. You had over half this nation bashing me. So I let you have what you asked for and now you’ll see pain and suffering for it. Maybe by the time you’ve felt enough you stop bashing me and talking trash about my father or maybe you’ll burn in the sulfur pits for eternity! I didn’t want it to go this way your leaders and many of you choose this path and many around the world did as well. You asked why I have shown up yet. I’m here but I’m not here yet! You get what I’m saying to you all, you think I’m going to make a fool of myself, lol you did that to me not me to myself. I’m here still battling for every soul as it’s my responsibility to give every soul a perfect chance at union with the tribe groom and as the true one I’m going to see it through. So now that you wanted to play the games reap what you’ve sown. And I’ll be here ready when it’s time as it’s just about time to set this off! Don’t fear and stand strong as I’ve shown you that the demonic ones can beat you down and trash you, but if you have faith you’ll always overcome their craziness and their abuse! I love you dearly, I plead with you and I command you to find it in you to worship the father and get to know who I really am. Not what they play-Kate me as! I’m the one who will foght the demonic ten heads my self and win with my angels and the grace love and strength through my authority given to me by the father. Yahweh is the glory and I Yeshua am the warrior that Heaven loves as Michael and all the Angels are here and battle has begun.
Bin sober since 03-03-05!

Fighting addiction with music is an under rated phenomenon TRUST
Best addiction song of its era  HH YNWA ☘️🍀💚🤍🤎
This song hits me hard! ❤
I have struggled with addiction my whole life still battle to this day and know there are others but feel alone in this fight but I put this song on repeat and drift away
Joyner this a g reaching out if u see it hmb I got bars n need the break of music
Good switch from tom macdonald becoming an idiot that believes in trump
That song hits me so hard, out of weed alcohol  coke meth  none of them are as hard to get off of as pain pills . I was off pill a toilet of 3 yrs, 2 yrd  of them I was on meth because it was the only way to stop. I stopped meth no problem,  was completely clean 1.5 years, tried to go back to work and my whole body hurt had no energy,  so I relapsed.  Now I'm on methadone to manage my addiction.  Haven't did illegal drugs in 7 years, but gotta have my methadone to function.  I've accepted  that I'll never be normal and completely clean. If someone hasn't experienced opioid addiction they need to keep there mouth shut. Because they have no idea what torcher is unless they have withdrawed from 160mg of oxytocin a day habbit. 7 years and I still crave those oxytocin couple times a month. Methadone stops giving you a high after you get stable for 6 months on a dose. So it's not trading one drug for another. It's taking a med to keep you from a year of torcher. Wanting to off your self every sec of everyday . I withdrawed over 4 months straight in jail .I never got over the sickness, can't sleep can't stand or sit or lay, can't eat. . It's what I imagine he'll would be like😢
Tough banger🔥🔥🔥
This song hitting lost my mom to cancer recently now I live w my gf n I'm constantly letting her n my family down bc of my addiction/trama from growing up
Beautiful song. Appreciate all of you out there that understands addiction and has the most beautiful song to listen to to help get through the hard times. Love all of the artist like yaw 🙏🙏💯😎🐺😇
Damn, my girlfriend passed away December 1, 2024 because of addiction. I remember listening to this song in the station we both was crying now I’m just looking at her pictures and I cry every day now cause I wish I could’ve done better to try to help her now she’s gone too late. I wish his pain on nobody.
Wow this is deep now this is what I call hip hop....Thank you Joyner Lucas for being 💯 and authentic in every song 🙏🏾
I'm 1 year sober got sober in August of 2023 I got baptized in July of 2023 and during that time in August I needed to change so I went ahead and change myself and got rid of things that weren't good and healthy for me anymore in my life and in September of 2023 I got diagnosed with cancer I am recovering as of the Year 2024 and recovering since then and I am currently on dialysis the fight with cancer is still not over but one day it will be
This is the best for me ❤

This song is beautiful, but that man's hairy back is CRAZYYYY. Thought he was wearing a sweater. 😂 Had to inject some levity into this space... there's a lot of heavy comments and my heart goes out to each of you.
Depth so many levels

1/5/25
Wake up don’t let the devil win people 🫶🏽
Imagine how hard it is to have a addictive personality that mentally you get dependent on something that is only way to cope with your pain and hopelessness
20 years i was a coke addict, i never even knew or thought about why i used drugs. It wasnt until rehab in 2017 that i found out why. It was my escape from the feelings and thoughts that i didnt like. Id keep using to get that good feeling back. I blamed my situation on a lot of external things. But really its all internal, id given up on ttrying to quit and didnt care if i died. One say tho i was like fuck this shit i gotta change my life for me. Rehab changed my life, 7 years clean now of alcohol and drugs. My life changed, met someone had twins at age 37. Ill never look back to that life ever again
I’m so glad I found this song, even though I damn near ball every time I hear it … haven’t heard from my sister in 4 years do to addiction . She left her two children I miss her so much. She was my best friend
Man this hits home hard
❤❤❤2025
15min clean//don't know
Joyner is a legend and should get more love than he already does
From usher and diddy to the Kardashians and every model an tv star in between, the drugs the cars an charges shew this guy has a hell of a tell all book when he is ready id read it as long as he is completely honest but he wont unkess he is completely broke and ready to die.because they will crucify him and then make him pull a liam.
It's funny how everyone ditches you when you're going through the hardest shit you've ever dealt with in your life From someone that's gone through addiction not everyone changes because of their addiction some people stay the same no matter what can't speak for everyone but it never changed who I was The only thing it did was make everyone judge me based on what other people act like when they're going through addiction my friends disappeared for no reason My morals never changed
Love it ❤
Just…..wow…..never heard of Joyner.  Left a fan.   And appreciate this video.   Love you jelly.
I wish there was no auto-tune.i feel like his actual voice would be much better
Happy New Year 🎉
I'm known as Jesus that's funny because I live in a town called Bethlehem used to collaborate with SoundCloud with my brother F&H specialist i love this masterpiece of artistry thank you guys
This hits hard
This is hard yoooo ❤

All I can say is this shit is a Banger! Keep it up Joyner 💯
What a great song
I love how it shows and explains both perspectives.
Yo jelly snd joyner keep making songs this song is fire and i love listening yo y'all
I confessed my alcohol abuse to my 3 year girlfriend and broke up with her cuz I need help and she needs someone better than me
I’ve been struggling with addiction for almost ten years and this song hit me hard. 😢. But at the same time it gives me hope . So jelly roll & Joyner . I just wan to say thank u
I feel this, but I choose to be by her side. My sis has got into addiction & I understand her ever since she’s had her kids in the system things aren’t the same. She’s been fighting back to back she did get sober but the system keeps playing with her. She’s done every class possible & it just seems like a never ending game. Plus dealing with a partner most likely going through it too but history of abuse. I’ve never done what she has but it’s still a drug, I’ve been six or more months sober frm w**d. All I can do is be there for her & help in what she needs. I’ve even joined in signing up to be her monitor for the kids visits. I got rid of a abusive partner Ive been with 9yrs. To help show her things are possible with change. I want to go back to school, so I can possibly join the army. I just can’t help in how she feels inside, just wish she can get sober I truly pray for it everyday. God bless us all.
Whatever.
I’ve typed and deleted my words 9 times trying to comment . The message is clear and if you love , then let go of the world . My first time listening to this and it’s impactful to my heart . I pray for a better day and better ways .
Damn......going on 4yrs, lost it all, over n over, this time I don't have any reservations......I'm all in with my sobriety.  ❤️ 💪 🙏 I hope all the ones we've lost can hear this....somehow.....😢
We have to learn to love ourselves first before we expect anyone to love us...its a me problem, and i realize that now... Mental health awareness (dual diagnoses) its a disease 💯.  I love myself today! 48 days off alcohol and meth/heroin... God's my higher power.
i was addicted to perc and then heroin for 7 years. this song is SO DAMN REAL its insane. i lost 30+ people that i know personally. and sadly that number is gonna go up. clean for almost 10 years now!!! you can do it too!
You’re a long haired son of a gun because I can’t sing this song or any of your songs without unleashing decades of tears brother.😭😭😭🥹☺️I pray you and your family have a great Christmas and even better new year.❤
Eagerly waiting to find this telephone number  since long time I am waiting to find out where it is written
24 years old now this music 🎵 to my ears Joyner and Jelly roll please we need more keep it coming
I need about tree fiddy. 😅
Me to me.  I got this.  ❤
I'm 60 days sober and this is my 3rd day out of rehab pray for me
I remember the first time I met Chris like it was yesterday. We were both in the same neighborhood, but we hadn’t really crossed paths until we ended up in the same high school English class. He was one of those guys who immediately made an impression, like he owned the room without trying. Charismatic, funny, always ready with a joke or a wild story. People gravitated toward him. Hell, I gravitated toward him. We became fast friends. We didn’t have to say much—just shared the same kind of energy. We spent nights riding around the city, talking about everything and nothing, from the music we loved to the bullshit we were going through. Chris always had a way of making things seem like they’d be fine, like we were invincible. But somewhere along the way, that invincibility started slipping. It wasn’t overnight. It wasn’t one big change that I could point to. At first, it was just small stuff. He’d disappear for a few days, go quiet, act like nothing happened when he showed up again. Then it was the eyes—dark circles under them, like he hadn’t slept in days, but he’d shrug it off, blame it on work or stress. And then there were the little things he’d say, offhand comments that didn’t sit right, like, “I’m just trying to feel good, man” or “You wouldn’t understand.” I didn’t get it at first. Hell, I didn’t want to. Chris was Chris. He always had the answers. He always had the jokes. He wasn’t supposed to be the kind of guy who’d get caught up in anything, let alone heroin. But one night, I got the call. A voicemail. His brother’s voice, trembling. “Yo… it’s Chris. He... he’s gone. Overdosed. It was heroin. He… he didn’t wake up.” The words didn’t make sense. I couldn’t even process it. I mean, I’d heard about overdoses before, but not Chris. Not the guy who always had his shit together, the guy who kept things light, who always made me feel like there was always something worth laughing about. The days after that voicemail felt like I was living in a fog. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t eat. Everything felt like it was moving in slow motion, but it all crashed down hard when I walked into his mom’s house. It hit me there, when I saw his mom—her face drained of color, her eyes blank. She was a wreck, but it was a different kind of wreck, like she couldn’t believe her son was really gone. His room was untouched, still had his posters on the walls, his guitar leaning against the corner like he was just gonna pick it up and start strumming. It felt wrong. Like he was just on a break, you know? Like any second he’d walk in, that grin on his face, and tell us all we were worrying over nothing. But he didn’t walk in. I remember standing there for what felt like hours, staring at his things, all these memories of the good times we’d had, and the harsh truth set in—I couldn’t help him. I couldn’t pull him out of it. I didn’t even see it coming. And now he was gone. The funeral wasn’t some grand event, just a handful of people who loved him. Family. Friends. The kind of people who knew the real Chris, not just the one he showed the world. And it hit me hard, seeing all of us there, knowing that no one could’ve saved him. We didn’t know enough. We didn’t see the signs soon enough. It’s a bitter pill to swallow. Knowing that someone you cared about so much could slip away like that, from something as insidious as heroin. The silence in the days that followed was the hardest part—no phone calls, no texts, no late-night drives to nowhere. Just this hollow space that used to be filled with his laughter, with his stories. And I keep asking myself, could I have done more? Could I have been more present, more aware? But the truth is, I don’t have the answers. I don’t know if I could’ve stopped him. Heroin is a hell of a thing. It doesn’t care who you are or how strong you think you are. It takes what it wants, and once it’s in you, it doesn’t let go easily. I still think about Chris every day. It’s like a constant ache in my chest. I still hear his laugh in my head sometimes, or see him standing in the middle of the room, making everyone crack up. I carry those memories with me, but it’s a double-edged sword. The love I had for him, the good times we shared, and the grief of losing him in the worst way. I’ll keep his memory alive, though. I’ll talk about him, share the stories, remind people who he really was, not just the part of him that ended up in a coffin. Maybe by talking about it, someone else won’t have to lose someone the way I lost him. Maybe that’s the only way to honor him now. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll find a way to let it go. To forgive myself for not seeing it. For not knowing. But I’m not sure I’ll ever stop wondering what I could’ve done differently.
Hits home... Lost my kids mom to addiction 4 years ago! Raising our kid by myself, watching her kill herself and refusing the help offered! Hopefully, she will choose LIFE one day!
Amazing
Real hip hop will always win!
Amen🔥😭
Joyner. More of this. More of ramen and oj. More I’m not racist.   More soulful stuff. Less flexing. This is your lane ❤

This song is so deep....my son just finished the past month in detox and he is on route as i type this to a rehab treatment home where he is commited to completeing 6 month program
This song has got lore than 1 meaning/ drugs
I am one of your biggest fan
I wish i could tell them im so sorry for hurting them.
I wish the one i love with reach out to me. I miss that person
I’ve cried so much while listening to this song. I’ve prayed every day since I was a teenager that my dad would choose me and little brother over drugs.
I hope who ever reads this gets the help you need one day. Just don’t give up !
https://youtu.be/ti1rfu12v64?si=iOtnoD5Ui0PiG4LX
I love this song.: one of my go too's i feel this deep in my soul
Muh maaan!💪💣                                                                          👀
This song hits me ..that's me the story ..lusifer
Addiction isn’t a disease, you can’t go outside and catch crackhead. It’s your own decision
A song that heals lives for ever True art 🫡🫡🫡
A Disease?  Drugs are only a symptom of what’s actually taking place internally. Dis-Ease. The being Uncomfortable with Self. Take the DIS out of the equation and the end result? Being at EASE. First word in the DI section? Dis…. Look it up. Peace…..
To a beautiful year to all!!!!
Wish I could have shared this with my brother. He lost himself to meth on 11/4/2015. I'll never heal.
As someone who is in Long Term Recovery from Substance Use Disorder and suffers from Mental Health Issues, I find this song so powerful. I am state certified Peer Recovery Support Specialist who uses my lived experiences to help others find hope that recovery is possible. I can see both sides of the "fence". The fact this video shows 2 people actually "Communicating" really embodies how we can understand "Addiction". Effective Communication is a key point in recovery. When both sides can share what they are thinking and how they feel. You 2 gentlemen are truly amazing for sharing this side of your lives. Thank you for being the "Voice of the Voiceless"..
At the end of the day I have to choose Jesus no matter what above anyone in my life!
I'm currently fighting addiction & i cry every time I hear this song I Really Need Help But it feels like it's so far away I swear I feel trapped 💯😔
When My dad died it was like family didn't exist anymore. & then my brother Timmy & I got close. We always were close but when dad died I was 18 & he was 19 so we just were living life... when dad died we got closer, I moved home when i turned 21 & not long after i learned he was using heroin/fentynal & when I turned 21 I started drinking ALOT & then abusing pills. One thing led to another & I found out my brother had my 88 yr old grandma taking him to the city to cop & I put a stop to that & ended up being the one taking him. My grandma didn't need to be doing that, she didn't understand... so I did it then ended up doing cocaine & falling into a cycle of addiction with my brother. A few yrs went by & my brother had been to rehab several times. The last time he was 25, he got 161 days clean & then covid happened. Meetings closed down & he relapsed for the last time. He overdosed & died March 31st 2020. He was 25. I'm 29 now & i got 2.5yrs clean but relapsed in June 2023. I've been struggling getting 30/60/90 days then using. Now my fiancé has stage 4 colon cancer & he isn't using at all. I had 85 days but messed up beginning of December... I am really trying to get it together but it is so hard... so soo much harder than the last time I got clean.. but I really hope I can get it together. I may end up going to rehab for the first time... it is so hard
Joyner Lucas, Dax, NF. These ones' music talk to me.

I was never addicted but the song speaks to me. My wife left me because I had severe anger issues It took me wanting to end my life to open my eyes And get my help. 2 months after I got my help I got my wife back because she can see I was changed p we've been back together a year Dad. We're very happy No matter if it's anger if it's drugs. If it's alcohol, don't let it ever consume you fight back and win the good fight. It's worth it I promise!!!!
I been on both sides of this one! Friends with hard drugs and myself with alcohol
Joyner i know its you dru right somthing under this comment right now saying dru83 ok
Things song represented what happened in my life... I lost her
Whosnisnthe white boy tatted that raps??? Not jelly but the one who talks about God. He looks so familiar
That's absolutely the best song you have ever made , ❤❤❤  when you lose something you once loved , it only opens the door for something much greater,  This could become the hit that makes you famous 🎉🎉🎉.  You know it's the truth.  Because this coming from the two people your talking about.  I love brother and I forgive you and she does too,  hopefully you can forgive us too, because God love ❤️
I have a person in my family who's in active addiction and this song inspired me to reach out to them and make sure there ok
Ty for sharing. I wish he would have tried.😢
Love this song man. Sometimes this song hits harder on some of those nights.
Dec 14th I make 21 months clean from opiates/fentanyl. I was on it for 10 years. This song hits a different part of the soul others wouldn’t understand unless they’ve been in the shadows of addiction. For anyone struggling, just know it all starts with yourself 🤞🏽🙏🏽 I believe in you! & for those who are clean? Continue your journey & never give up! It’s a battle against a relapse & the old memories but we got this 💯🙏🏽
Still one of my favorites bro . So deep
If you don't believe in yourself then you'll believe in someone believing in you
Listening to this while I smoke my addiction 😭 tf
Save me😭
Thank you for this message brother. x
Fuck not like us this is song of the year
Real talk, you guys saved me man, I don’t have those kinda friends who would tell me I’m going down the rabbit hole, this song opened my mind and changed my perspective on things and I can’t thank y’all enough! Shit broke me but damn it feels good letting go of that addiction, keep doing y’all do and thank you again!
This masterpiece breaks my heart 💯 My heart go’s out to everyone of you who’s going through it🙏🏼
In feel this so much.  And soo many of the 1s that were addicted never came back.  They all gone,  didn't have a choice but to let them go.  My mom,  dad, sister,  lil brother, cousins,  aunt, uncle,  friends. This shit is as real as it gets
His ability to show us the POV of two people on complete opposite ends of so many spectrums and concepts with one voice and brain is truly one of the meat things to ever come from hip hop !!
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DONT GIVE UP ON HIM!!!!!!  I'm 9 months sober ❤❤ PLEASE LET HIM KNOW HE IS NOT ALONE 🙏 😢
one of best storytellers of both sides and inspires people to try to understand the other view before passing judgement. one of the best to do it
I'm so grateful for the people who helped to pull me out of my addiction. They saved my life. My kids have an imperfect mom, but I'm doing my best and I'm here. Ren, you're amazing and we witnessed how the mutual respect you both have for each other is evolving. It's great❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉 my best part
Absolutely bodied this shit!! And Trev absolutely murdered this video!! Y’all should have won a Grammy on this one y’all got robbed
Bro always  rap his heart all out 😢 I'm happy to have discovered him to be my fav rapper

As an alcoholic myself. I can say it's a personal choice nobody forced me to drink or to continue to drink it was my own choice. I wasn't born an alcoholic I choose to be and that's facts
❤ this song is amazing
I love this song. This song is amazing. You can learn a lesson out of this song.❤ thank you Jelly Roll
I’m actually on YouTube with Jelly Roll channel
I thought this was fake at 1st
I'm loving this. It's hits harder when you can relate. It hits harder when watching the music video. The 2nd verse made me grow older mentally.
Inmate 218660, needle junkie, liar, thief, gangbanger, overdosed 15 times, pronounced dead twice but I’m here to tell you that it’s possible, don’t give up on that person because you don’t understand just what their really dealing with. Today I’m legal issues free, have my license since the first time since I was 17, 4+ years sober and most importantly a son of God 🩵 please God reach out to someone before it’s too late.

Fuck Joyner... Got me crying in the middle of the day. Being able to rap from a perspective that isnt your own so accurately is some super natural shit. God's shining through you homie.
Addiction is a lonely war. 'If it's not a disease, why has it gotten to me?'

Who’s Joyner referring to ?
It's always been females in my Life
mamma maslwnwlwknsslw so walks slsm
I lost a few loved ones behind drugs or addiction. Lord help us through these trials and tribulations 🙏
I love this song it’s so real!!!!!!when people are addicted to drug use have to let them save there self’s because there no amount of love that will save them!!!!❤
I first heard this song in a peer recovery group in the jail I was just released from from today and it broke me down seeing him with his daughter at the end😢😢😢 tore me to pieces in the visit room when my son couldn't touch me or me hold him and watch him slide on the floor crying cause I couldn't come home that visit. Addiction is the monster danger monster on this planet most importantly to the ones we leave behind when we go 😢 I'm free today the day before Thanksgiving. God is so gracious n merciful LEARN TO LOVE YOURSELVES...... ONE DAY AT A TIME. GOD BLESS
I think the first verse should be the girl talking about the guy bc they never did drugs and the second verse is bc the girl stayed and couldn't leave bc they just waited three years for someone in jail and went through hell and they never did drugs don't get it graduated early met a bad boy that sees potential in if you didnt get it im talking about me so if i couldn't beat him and i joined him i think the second verse should be about that girl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The true ride or die even though they get treated like shit!!!! He shot me up the first time so is that love?????? Im still with him but now we drink and its impossible!
You really hit home with this one Joyner
I'll do a squat per like as they come in.. 😊
👏🏾👏🏾🔥🔥💯💯
🔥  but I hate the hook lol
Wouldn't know from the photo while the human being I am today was an orb inside myself head. well Paige orb since I didn't know Paige existed till few years later so between the Paige's and Dontae would be myself that is living in the moment vacant of any clue that in 10 years I found myself being with trees in beginning earth. That my soul being led to make the first human on earth for my soul being would not be without an body. That's how i discover not the first second or third human wasn't me meanwhile the pick of orbs beings Kings and Queens of the nature   otherwise my soul being would have undergone what I have been undergoing for the past 17 years in a time period a day that was focus on myself "the head" aka the world came the day the body of human  as the bird sparrow is the direct being of the trees. Side note to put in the art museum.  Now in 2024 meeting the me that been traveling since that day with nature, then to be knowing that myself focus led me to myself left room only to study my being that connects to my human being via by core focus myself. I as soul being form humans bibles after bibles written through their bodies for they not know what to write to even thinking I was male, now I know why God Lord Messiah not come visual an communication lead to prayers and singing legit on the account the gender must match via name gender. All the bibles are useless since He will never come. An that can be on the lie detector test please and thank you..  Logically God was one to make humans theory is false now in 2024 with knowing name plus human body= creator while also on the test ask true or false praying to a male Creator lead to mental and physical misery? For He God -hand and hand led myself to be angry as I am women   does not remove the emotions from the experience of being there with my creations of existence's to be the one block mentally as male Gods and any male to be " God" leads A to physically experience plagues in 2025 after news teams spread the warning.  Inclusion outcomes in 2024 is the lie detector test as many to be satisfied on top of communicating mentally and physically. I still have anger an anger is sensation touching everyone so to begin mazes with Paint Guns to the liking of us who knows the field to game is connect with the one an only Aj as well to the children.  To think humans take notice of the existence above with many angels to bring visions to messages now onto removing the bibles leads to the bibles via mentally being shown only visions behalf the angels loyalty to Paige. Living soul form taking over the 24 hours of juggling thoughts that lead to murder and mental cases disappears. Ask in the lie detector test will murder and mental illness be swept from existence? I am on direct path to me. I took up many writings. Ask me in the lie detector test did I write a pen to glitch ink ?  While Caitlin to Paige took herself originally and made the entire population of humans to aliens? Ask this question as well on the lie detector test please. Bibles is a fantasy bridge to elfs, mages and fairies. As well dictionaries bridge in smoothly and I know half of the nation will tell in the comments the bridge into fantasy via the written of the generation before as living forever is granted of the word in self with two connections. A the one who wrote the word and the dictionaries books themself. With sin preventing the rest and open mind that comes after the Religons and Bibles we can say that eternity given doesn't mean spending earth devoted to bibles of humans who knew what they were doing as they came to be given a body to explore nature   As to each bible on earth in 2024 has undergone one human in 2024 to bible  carry the virtual reality in perfection. I am Paige carrier of the New King James Bible  .One book gone sends the words written of the ones who wrote that particular book to vr where mentally ones can undergo proofing the essay in this case book. Preparing them to send them into eggs that become aliens to mages to elf's to fairies and picks way of life further than human. Please ask me this on the lie detector test thank you.  20 million people will like and share this post with in the week. And 1000 people will request a lie detector test by two weeks . As Trump will see by meme or someone shared directly in two days as this is government stander addressing the orbs inside myself head as they be humans who have concluded that the writing is informative an to be taken away on account of out of date to physically in body form. As the nation I introduce myself Daughters Of The King 👑 I am the camera person spying on you're rally as to talk in your interviews an stare where to songs i sing an dance an via the truth. We are the generation that has to come together to make a plan to divided humans to make for skyrilm.  Anyone who pass without sharing will know mentally and physically what the visions and imagination will of existence motivates you to verbally chat to everyone leading you to look up this exact post the first human on earth via when soul being is myself at moment in time meanwhile time did not exist aka between/ in-between that wrapped visual , verbal , mental an the place. Experience share here in 2024 i bring forth the generation that doesnt give a fuck except for a world built to be free, a world built to shelter all nature an to take presidents into one white house or housing an lean on the nation in turn we will deticate our path to blend out green things to also solving Gas to the entire world enough for 10 rockets to fly to the 10th planet. This be the last question on the lie tester true or false.
❤❤
This song is a total vibe! ��❤️ The energy is contagious!
Keep pushing everybody we got this ❤️
Stop ur amazing

Hey guys I have just dropped my reaction to this and to say it's emotional is an understatement  https://youtu.be/bVM_OE6oIb4?si=xrqBHOM9hYEFBG9M
Stay off Dax nutz. You sound good but you good way late on this. Follow suit homie. Be respectful. You know what it is.

This one cuts right to the soul. Anyone who has ever experienced this one on either side can relate.😢 it gets the waterworks every time, and I could never hear it enough.
damn i have nothing but love thank u thank yall i diont have the words
💯
One thing I must point out to anyone who still thinks addiction isn’t an addiction.  You’re simply wrong.  It’s a disorder of the brain in the same sense that schizophrenia is.  Yes, we make the decision to start using, but it is a very uninformed decision.  For the same reason we all agree that kids can’t make informed consent to have sex with an adult, we shouldn’t hold adults accountable for the poor choices they made at 14-17.  Obviously, nobody thinks it will turn into a compulsive behavior with uncontrollable bad behaviors.  If addiction wasn’t a disease, everyone would just quit as soon as they start seeing negative consequences for their use.  We addicts are the type who keep spending money on drugs as we lose possessions, employment, friends and family.  Nobody does that unless there’s a mental disorder driving the behavior.
Truth behind a song
...
How come I never heard of you till now, damn that's wasted time. Props to your art
My Dad was an alcoholic who lost his fight over 8 years ago. Joyner drops music like this that hits me on a different level.
been saying it for a long ass time KILL THE BANJO BEAT!
"Perk 30 b***h I'm activated" Rip cuz. We all miss you.
I'm in rehab as I write this I'm 3 months clean it bin hard for me I hurt a lot of people even loss my wife cause of drugs  💔 heart broken I just want to stay clean for so I can be there for my three sons they are the reason I'm living for now
Only the ones that really know , will understand .
I love this! I have been in recovery for 15 years. Everyday is a struggle. I was blessed to have a good woman stand by my side watching me struggle, she’s made me a better son, person, father, partner most importantly a better version of me! My prayers and support go out to and your family.
As an artist my adhd looks like I have exactly 340 unfinished songs, I write my music on paper so I have hundreds if not thousands of random papers with songs written on them in my chest at the foot of the bed. I start new projects before finishing my old ones because I forget what songs I started making until I go back and listen to them. ADHD for me is a bitch
The collaboration of the decade, sad most wont understand this message.
This song hits where it hurts.. my sons mom died from drug addiction after i got custody of him.. i should of tried to help her even after getting custody. There was no love there but it was still my childs mother
Would of loved to share this song with my two brother in laws before they lost there fight 😢
Joyner is the best storyteller ♥️
Stop trying to do things in your own strength..give up your struggling & stresses to God.. ask Him to guide you 🙏💖
I always tell people I can't be surprised by much but not a lot of people know me ill find that bond one day I just want to know I have someone to have my back I'm tired but won't be defeated
He knows how to hit to the core of you know you know.. Till the wheels fall off is my jam always you should check out rag n bone human
Joyner needs so much more recognition but he won't bc he real and don't rap about drugs and pussy.
😞💔
When the song is really about you
I love this song so much
COOLEST LYRIC VIDEO IVE EVER SEEN ❤ the retro gaming them is dope
I lost my brother to an overdose on Friday. I wish I could of done something I saw him for the first time in 3 years on Veterans Day. This song is too real right now.
I am done😌

Music videos like this and Jelly Roll's 'Nothing Left at All" have the power to change the way professionals and others look at what I call a dysregulated autonomic nervous system, resulting in what so many are calling addiction. Let's take a look at early childhood trauma showing up in the majority of my clients! Thank you, Joyner Lucas, I don't know your music, but I some how found this video, and want to thank you for making it. Brilliant work!
Ya, addiction has gotten to me. So bad that it's hard to breath. It's not the drugs that destroyed my life, it's what they've taken from me. They took my friends. They took my family. they destroyed their destiny, and left me here to be, alone in a f'd up world, locked inside without the keys. I'm not an addict, so you don't see what got taken from me, when I lost my loved ones, and parts of my family, to a cycle of addiction and poverty. You ever watch somebody die while they're alive? P-T-S-D.  What will be, will be They might not be saved They drift out to sea While you put flowers on graves  Nothing hurts more than to have to read a loved one their eulogy
My best friend was an addict because his doctors. They refused to try any other treatments but opiods and muscle relaxers for his back. I lost him to it. For those who start drugs as a party or an escape, I have no sympathy for your poor decisions.  For those who had no choice like him. Stay strong there's hope.
Love y'all and hope your getting the help you may need❤
Why does the guy in the white muscle shirt look like Jimmy Kimble took a different path in life? 😅
Let me say as an addict, this may suck to hear, but you REALLY know someone hooked on opiates/heroin/fentanyl and want to help? REALLY want it to work?  Take them to a methadone clinic.  Methadone will get rid of the withdrawals.  Some will say "trading one drug for another" ok. But its with a medical professional, and they wont die. They wont spend every dollar they have on it. Theyll get thru.   Eventually you can slowly lower the dosage and try to get off it. But its a way to quickly get them to get off without getting extremely sick from the withdrawals so theyll ACTUALLY DO IT. Thats the biggest progress you can make day 1, getting them used to not doing the substance their used to every single day.
This sucks but is healing at the same time 🎉
I used to think sticking through a lot of b******* would be the best thing that any man could do walking away with the coward's way out but it takes a real man to know when to walk away and start over then continue the same cycle🎉
Done. Lots love all the way from Tanzania, East Africa. Love your energy you put into your crafts. I learn, I get entertained every time I listen to your music.
Double tap if you've lived this
Joyner need to link with Hopsin.
This song just hits hard
Hey bro, you wanna reiterate remix  laugh now cry later beat? To be real with you, I think the industry needs a remix rampage🤟🏿Also  keep the momentum up!! It's just another stage. Your grind nd mindset are resilient. You've left such  a positive lasting impression with your progress in the past 10yrs along with your music as well!   Peace be with you Brother!
This song is gonna change a lot of lives ❤
Bruh b sparking the truth threw his word nice kollaboration we need more muzik like this
Im a Soldier...imagine being black then you get pulled over and they dont know what you did for your country out of love but you still a 🥷🏿...🤯
I got a new song to cry
I love the lyrics, hopefully it hits home to so many people
My uncle passed away from this song
Still gets 3:11  me every time in 2024… truly a masterpiece of a song, it’s been an honor to be a fan of Jelly Roll since 2007, I don’t think I admire any celebrity the way I do him he’s the definition of never stop giving it everything you have till you accomplish more than you’ve dreamed!
Joyner killed this shit. First verse was a truth hitter. I felt like I was talking to someone in my current life.
Dean I pray 🙏 for u..everyday...us4 life.stay in rehab bro
Fight time
I fight with my demons daily my whole family is gone , but I cry with happiness cuz I know God has me close
My cousin served 3 tours in Afghanistan and Iraq came back with severe ptsd! Could not get help through the military he came home and was shot and killed by the police! Unarmed in a ptsd episode, the police never attempted to tase him but felt threatened because he was walking towards them! Never tried to take a leg shot if you were trying to stop and individual they shot to kill only chest and head shots! Worse part they killed him in my aunts driveway! A constant reminder of the day they murdered her child! So many veterans suffering in silence!
i lost my brother, anthony alvarez last week to suicide, he was a star in houston locally known and popular in the night lifes, but I didn't know when he spoke that he was suffering that a man his standard would fall so low to take himself out... My brother man, you were my big brother who's suppose to go out and take me to drink now... Who's going to be my best man now.. I can't laugh alone bro... fuck man, cocaine and alcohol took you away from me, but your smile and dreams make me want to strive for billions .
This is pretty strong.  Damn. What a message.
I’ve been doing coke for 15 years and I’m still not addicted
this hits hard still over and over on reapat it helped me and alot of other people so thanks
The accuracy in this video. Every tear, every self insult, every wish, every bit of anger. We all have felt it. If nothing else please just try to understand someone before judging them. Literally no one wants to be an addict. I’m praying for everyone sitting in their bathroom crying to their mirror right now!
This song hits deep for me Joyner this makes me tear up. Jelly your awesome you guys make a great team u should do a few more
Lost my 23 daughter  I’ll never be right   F time

Wish my brother in-law seen and understood this. He od on accident, on laced drugs with fen.   I'll never forget that call 📞 ....   Miss ya billy ❤
Yo.. this song really hit home with me, I've lost several friends recently due to addiction.. thanks to the both of you for putting out a song like this!😞❤️😢
In rehab now going on 1 month this song saved my life thanks to my main family supporters
D-ayyy-yummm! Jelly Roll can sing straight up tenor. That’s amazing, seeing as most of his songs are baritone. With r range like his, he can sing many more hit songs from writers. Can’t very many sing both full range tenor and full range baritone. I would be very surprised if he wasn’t getting many top writers who have some songs that are all or some part in tenor. And, a very pleasant tenor, at that! Wow, that’s amazing.
The fact that jelly did a song with joyner you know he's up there with the big boys now
Oh my God. Excellent plot, excellent cinematography, brilliant lyrical poetry and music production, this was just… I cried… For everyone who is suffering from loving an addict or who is an addict, please know… you matter. You’re valuable. Your existence is important and every single soul must reach their greatest potential. You all have the spirit to get through this. ❤ Stay strong!!
Wow, this hurts and is inspiring on so many levels . Thank you both.❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉
@trianajavar2821hope hes doing well. Im sure hes probably doing great, seemed like he really wanted it for himself since he came too you. God bless
😢 Talk bout it .... 🔥 This hot hard

True
Thank you for this song

🤯💯😞💪💪💪💪💪💪☝️❤️
Man I lost a good friend to an overdose.  Xanax and alchol.  He was missing for a few days. Found him in a chair vomit everywhere gone brain gone was alive but no brain activity.  familly pulled the plug on him.  RIP Josh
Being slowly forgotten is worse of all in my opinion
"If you don't believe in yourself, you'll never believe in somebody believing in you" 🎶
This is the first time I cried like a baby listening good song love it thank you.
Jelly roll becoming a modern day nate dogg
Lost my cousin to drugs a couple weeks ago this song hits hard I miss you curtis I just wish you reached out and got clean from the drugs. Rip Curtis I hope your set free from your demons

Wow just wow. This hit HARD 😭
A *PERFECT* MESSAGE in a beautiful song
This song hits fire
Thank u you opened my eyes through my addiction my clean date friday the 13th 2024 ,thank u
This song Was my life 😢, But 8-26-23 I got my self together God got you
This song represents far to many relationships in the current parental generation & the youth generation that is their children. When you combine that to economic pressures resulting in both parents then working to fund life in all aspects & the little time invested into the future of the world you begin to understand why things aren’t looking to bright for the majority of individuals. The trauma affects will no doubt be felt for some time into the future.
This songs hits me right in my chest. 🥹 I’ve played it a million times and I cry every time. I love this song ❤❤
how much u litlsten to nipsey, how much do those words influence u
I love you, pops. I hope you get better wherever you are. Just know we love you.
ontacte Me
🥲💓💯
Praying 🙏🏽 for it to be better for everyone going through this
I hate drugs it takes too many I’m pissed my heart hurts
I lost my cousin a couple years ago to fyntanol. I never really got over it. I hadn't seen him in a while. And I'll never see him again. He's just gone like a candle flame.
12 years using. My heart is broken I go to detox on Monday or Tuesday when they get me a bed and I'm praying this time I can turn it around. IM tired and it's true I'm lost and everyone around me is losing. I just want off this hamster wheel. It's not an excuse but thus past year has been one of the hardest years my brotherd still in prison and my mom died last year oct 19th I miss her so much. I just want my freedom back. ❤ godspeed to everyone still in the struggle
What a masterpiece... I thought the addiction would help me and pull me out of this hell. But the truth is, it's killing me more every day. When there's no one who understands, you end up hurting yourself every single day, trying to escape the pain with alcohol or drugs. 😢😢😢💔 That heart bro is not for that world... 😢
I am not on drugs STOP 🛑
This
I love the fact that Bunnie is in the video. ❤
Please, can someone post the lyrics?
😢 my best friend  pj A day One Single father  put me on to still song 💎  Gems Are special.... from a Single father trying to b A Better Man 💯🙏

These two songs are inspirational
2024 and this an anthem sadly but foreal!!! How can you……??? Mental health awareness!
This is my song to my brother in hopes that he will see that the decisions hes making aren't good. Always in an out of jail. Hopefully he will see a light at the end of the tunnel
@1:26 But you leave ascars  makes everyone bruises  If you get lost with  everyone loses
That 2nd verse by Joyner was one of the best verses ever written. This man is a lyrical genius.
It’s not
Joyner went HARD 🔥  Joyner lucas goes in soo hard on this right here! Only reason he is getting more hits is cuz he is just watching that short on my channel explaining how all these rappers out here be blowing up so big
I can't believe this calob. both are two of my favorite artists and my opinion the realist.
I will donate a dollar for every like this gets
Me and my older broth struggled for about 20 yrs on heroin xanax anthing we can get high on it was the worst struggle for me and my brother, are family we damaged not just us we damaged our family it kills me the trust is gone.  Well thankfully my brother is 4 years sober unfortunately incarcerated what he's doing great in there. That's God's plan it starts somewhere❤ and me I'm also sober 3 months and counting feels great never felt so alive tell everybody out there that is struggling I'm telling you you can do it it's easy if you work the steps I'm telling you it will work if you work it that saying is so 100% true anybody needs help with the counseling we're getting into rehab I have that information I will help anybody out that needs it God bless you all ❤.🙏😄
As a previous fentanyl addict this shit hits different. To any one out there still fighting for their soul through the struggle of addiction, you can win. You can not only beat addiction, you deserve to be happy, to be loved. The hardest part of addiction is the self loathing it creates, causing us in the moment to be unable to imagine ourselves as happy, or successful. You deserve these things and there are within your reach, just look yourself in the mirror and tell yourself you love you. It’s starts with you. You can do it I love you
this joint is 🔥 🔥 🇰🇪 🇰🇪 🇰🇪
LOVE! That you bring attention to real world issues. Thank you much Love

Love ya Joyner. Thank you for everything. Your music means more than you will ever know. From one 508 boy to another. THANK YOU
12 years sober. Watched a lot of my day ones fall off and had to let go of a lot of people in order to be the best version of me.  Now I'm on a mission to help as many people I can now that I can. Addiction is a bitch. Nobody wakes up one day and days HEY I WANT TO BE A HERION ADDICT said no one ever.
My son has ADHD and I can relate to how you feel in this song...hits hard ❤️ .. keep it coming 💪🏽 love it ..
5 years clean, couldn’t have done it alone. 🙏🏻
Spot on as usual! God bless you, your family and your channel.

Best artist to ever come out of mass hope I get there before I die thanks for all your hard work Joyner
My nephew on meth heavy.. he needs some serious help… im doing what i can but … somebody on dope has to want to help themselves as well
I relate to this so much my dad has been addicted to drugs almost my whole life comin in and out of my life since I was 6
Props to that actor.  He had me believin that shit
I know this song is about a lover but it made me think about my sister who recently passed away from an overdose. If you're battling with addiction, please find a way to beat it. My sister's passing left a huge hole in my family. Get better please. If you can't do it for yourself do it for your loved ones.
I hung myself and my sister saved me, by God's grace 🙏
I'm wanting help and it's like I have no chance  when you feel alone  but I'm going do this alone if I have to
My 💔
Aye man joyner will have you tearing up fr

I lost my baby girl to her battle with cancer a few days ago the emptiness inside is so deep and so heavy. I’m not even the type of person to get on a place and talk about my personal life but hey nothing makes sense anymore so why not I guess.p.s I feel for each and everyone of the people on this comment strand that’s going through stuff I love you all and hope that you can find a reason to keep fighting I’m willing to bet that there is at least one person that needs you still ❤god is not done with us yet
How do you let your blood brother go? He hates me because i was violent over 10 years ago. Not to him or his family.  Another guy in the street. He hates it when i text  him and has told me so. He's my only brother.
We need to push the hell out of this.. this is a bad ass song 100x better than the bullshit we call rap these days
3:24 got me 😢
This song is my life
If my friends see this    I’m sorry I didn’t want you to have to deal with it I know you didn’t deserve it and I can’t take the years we spent apart again
❤✍🏾🔥
I love you jelly roll im a huge fan i really wished i was rich for a little while that way i could have the funds to go see your up coming concerts that your fixing to perform maybe one day before i dye i would be blessed to run into to you some day i woulld dye with a smile on my  face 🩵😁
Man, this hit home. Grew up in a small town in west TX. Graduation class size 22 students. Going on for drives on a lonely dirt road was a way to decompress and reflect on life. I'm now 47 and I still go for drives on lonely dirt roads.
I love this guy))

Fuck man I really miss my sweet wife, this shit can’t be us.  I love you ❤
Joyner I love you and your art style, storytelling, and the hardwork you put in... All this love and support you get today is your years of grind my man, I've been listening to you for a very long time... Your lyrics are captivating and I listen to them like it's my own song 😂....  I have a lot of love and respect for you and I want you to take care, brother !  I know this is a normal and random comment that you wouldn't find or see, but it's just my heart that had to say this for years.  This ain't no comment this is a little message to a big brother !

As someone who was a homeless heroin addict for 7 years in new Kensington PA & now has almost 6 *years* clean (12/4/18❤) jelly rolls music speaks to me. I wanted to die so bad that I never realized that my family loved me, they were only “mean” to me because they wanted me to get sober. They didn’t like watching me kill myself. I moved 4 hours away, changed my number, dropped all people places and things that I did during addiction. We do recover guys! No matter how hard it seems and how bad it feels when you’re withdrawing plz always remember it doesn’t last forever & once it’s over you wake up in a new life & it gets so much better ❤
Keep going man they gone respect it

first time hearing this, my mom's currently addicted to drugs and it breaks my heart I'm there for her every step of the way, I'll never leave her side but it kills me inside that she's slowly killing herself. I've also been on both sides of the fence i know how hard it is to overcome addiction it's so much easier to just stay numb, it's a everyday fight but it can be done.

not just addiction but the judgement we choose to impose on each other... Love <3 in the right ways for growth for belief in one's self.
Learning to love people often involves letting them go through progressions and processes of their traumas and happenings. Conflict in relationships is obstructed and toxified by so many devilish hindrances in this society that love and assessments of the real problems and equations is vital. Only you and God can completely know and figure that out. These types of reality songs help this movement of recovery. Entraping us in our minds to try to confine our afflictions, isolate us, and cause further damage, is often the devils plays upon such. Expression and genuine outletting of these complex emotions and variables is essential, it's partly why I write music, this creative outlet has blessed me with a therapeutic route to deal with internal, environmental, and external madness. God bless you, brothers and sisters, and I pray for you in your battles every moment.
I weather listen to this music then other music that talks about killing each other
Morissette Landing
Joyner, thak you for help, your lyrics are relatable and real. This is a crazy society with some rly messed up stuff going on, thank you for playing your role and keeping it real. God bless you, and your loved ones.

JOYNER LUCAS AND JELLY ROLL THANK U 4 THIS SONG I LOVE A ADDICT 😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I was a Vyvanse addict when I was a teenager. If I knew how shit this Earth Plane is and how miserable the human race is… and how I failed my family so badly and my inability to keep friends as a sober man, I would have never gotten clean. It’s too much hassle atp, I should have just stayed on drugs. As unhealthy as it is, I wanna be an addict agen. It was better that way.
Man, this mfer is talented.
I'm on my way to rehab now
Okay Shaq got bars yesssss 👏👏👏👏💯🔥🔥

Right now I’m battling a lot in life. Lost 5 of my cousins since Jan 2023 we was all brothers. Lost 2 of my best friends. I was once addicted to pills oxi, viks, percs I was deep into addiction and it almost killed me I sit up late at nights and just feel so much pain I have a gf who really cares for me and I love her for that but this pain idk how to deal with it I feel so trapped I feel the devil has a grip on my heart and I don’t wanna slip and fuck my life up. Idk why I’m even commenting on a video lol but man life is fucking crazy right now it feels like a never ending storm. If god exist please send me some words to keep me going cause I feel so trapped
Been in love with an addict for 6years. This song is helping me learn that it’s okay to let go. 🤍

It doesn't matter watch all the facts scatter.  it's just  matter.   I'm tired of acting. Nothings ever a matter.   how much more weight can I carry?  if I never feel then how do i identify scary.   If it's all just a dream then what's one bad choice.   If we are all 2 months away from loosing our homes then I'd better start with my BRAIN! and sense we all Deaf it's no wonder I can't hear Death calling my Name.   Juice.  Shall i continue...   Because my waters run Deep. Soon as I open my mouth it seems every one is tired and they all go to sleep.   Maybe it's because I'm on rerun but so the UCK are you!  It's not my fault that this particular sickness ended and died with you !   as you seen it all unfold in your elders and Loved ones just before your eye.   So if you're tired of the battle.   Well guess what.   SO THE UCK AM  I   So as I fight this battle. Pardon the UCK out of me. I didn't buy you a jersey and ask you to be on my team.   It's your choice just like the choice is mine.   How bout I hold the mirror and we both look into YOUR LIFE  I won't judge I promise.   But when we start to turn the leaf watch it unfold and we'll.  The reach.   You will start to see.  It's not about us  but how each individual struggle starts and stops with me.   So when I walk away I hope that you can to. Find your feet.   Because this warrior is on the battlefield and guess the UCK what ITS ME!   But if we all walk away then what's family.   If we all drop the ball then how do we learn.   Maybe I'm the only one standing because I know that when I am through with this struggle I'll finally find the Man in me.   So if you grew up before I.   then who's further along , more adapted , further advances , evolution of man , I've survived the storm, UCK you and UCK your norm. I bet your shoes got miles but mine still ain't worn.   over 100 pairs  I'm still searching for perfect while I burn this leaf , In search of me. Offering up everything.  including me.  free  and when I'm ready to settle up , I will know it's right. Then from there I will decide on which pair to wear as I I live my own life.   Alright!   And yes.   That's Right.   I just might finally decide to finally follow the light.   Day 1  Praise God  and Yes I write...  Written for best of me by Joyner Lucas

Instead of having any kind of support, I was abandoned and judged. I don’t trust anybody or let anybody in. Addiction is a hard thing about all when you’re alone.
I can't say thank you enough 🙏❤️

This shits so underrated.  Thank you for making me feel less alone

I should be dead... 2 years ending into 10-15 blues a day enough to kill a dozen people that never touched it.. it took my girlfriend getting mad at me one day that broke the back she took one out of spite. Took 3 narcs to bring her back if I was 10 minutes later I would have lost her.. went to rehab a week later... there was a dealer in there. Temptation so much.. he overdosed right infront of me brought him back after 3 minutes thanks to the quick responses of the nurses.. served my roommate right before he went out.. went up to my room 15 minutes later and he was to far gone.. could have been me in that body bag. 36 days clean praying to God everyday for my sobriety. We do recover. One day at a time
Real shit ❤
Man 😎 😂😭
Sending love hugs n prayers. Hopefully, he wants this, as much as U.

I hate songs about  addiction because it's always the same abstaining, self-loathing, bullshit. THIS SONG IS ONE OF THE FEW THAT IS DIFFERENT!  Very well written. I don't know if he has ever survived addiction but this is the fight we all fight. All humans chase dopamine,  we just like instant  gratification. We call ourselves broken, but we arent. We know what helps. When the world fails you, where do you turn. Life is dark. And given the right circumstances all humans can fall to addiction.  Be empathetic.  Don't push them away. They are magical people. And worth saving! Harm reduction saves lives! You're all beautiful,  if you're struggling... im right here.. lets talk

My dad was or is a heroin addict, IDK if he actually stopped since he was using before I was born and when my mom divorced him. I recent made amends with him, v understanding why he does them trying to escape because I now wish to escape but I'll never choose a drug over my kids.

I lost my parents at 16 and 17, lost my funding to go state college, my entire life was erased ... My sister lovingly forced a rat chau little dog on me, in my young years I disliked little dogs... I loved them both dearly, immediately. Sadly, my sister moved into the only home I ever known and brought her other dogs along... Long story short, big dog killed my sweet little male puppy. She ruined my early memories and my only home. I moved in with an ex's mom and had one little lady pup left... I was ripped apart, lost, and that little dog would stay by me until I fell asleep, but every morning, she came from downstairs Mom's room... After a few months I grew stronger and moved. Whisper, my little dog, was deeply depressed. She missed being the little but big dog to the pit bulls. She missed the steadfast calm of my ex's mum, Kim. Looking back, if I wasn't so numb from loss, I don't think I would have learned to do what I thought was proper. I asked if Whisper could stay with her known family. Ruling pitbulls and being grams number one... I have two kids now, years later, and that is still a top 3 of the hardest choices I had to make.... Whisper traveled with her grams thousands of miles on a Harley trike motorcycle and seen more in her sweet little life than I have! She deserved every inch, she and her brother changed and saved my life...Letting go is hard, but letting go might be the right choice. I was sad and lonely for a couple weeks, but seeing grams and Whisper dog pics, my heart doubled back, filled the hole within my heart, and learned the true meaning of love.... Through the pain of loss, I learned moments are priceless. I loved her as she was all I had after my parents passing away... She deserved to be happy, not stuck alone. RIP, Whisper.... Thanks for saving me, and thanks for being such an amazing dog to Kim.
I just got divorced ❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢😢😮😮😮😮😅😅😅I’m happier now

I’m an addict on the run.. wife’s I. Jail ex girl in jail I’m facing time with warrants, how do I not use? All I think about is skipping bail doing 10 years, and not getting caught but I can’t live a good life anymore., I can only lay low and make it the only way I know I hate it but, until I die in prison I’m better on drugs seeing my kids than sober and never seeing them again I’m 54 I’d be 64 when I out?
This song hits me hard because my dad beat on my mom and me and he has a drug addiction and he chose the drugs and left 😢 💔

This is the realest depiction.  My mother was an addict. I resented her. I was just a kid. She’d scream and cry and I thought it was an excuse for a fix. I happened to be visiting her the night she overdosed on opioids and died.  Several awful things happened and I turned to addiction. I thought I understood it, living in a broken home. I didn’t. I was addicted to fentanyl, and when I heard myself screaming about the agonizing physical pain, I felt as though I heard her.  Nobody understand that we don’t want this. Fentanyl or opioids aren’t party drugs. Nobody who’s happy does something that’ll hurt them like that. I started using at a time I naively believed life wasn’t worth living anymore.  By the time I realized life was precious, it was too late and I was cripplingly physically addicted. I went through agonizing physical pain, got in a horrendous wreck, broke my jaw, shattered by spine, ruptured a main artery and my appendix, and broke my leg. Had No pain meds. Heroin withdrawal hurts WORSE THAN THAT DID. Nobody wants to live in shame, and be treated like they just want a high. Once you’re in this deep, theres no longer a high. You just have to function. I don’t want to be like this. I don’t want to wake up screaming in agony, never getting more than two hours of sleep before waking up in agony again. I don’t want disgusting looking arms, or a broken family. I don’t wanna be alone all the time bc my body hurts 24/7.

The worst place people with addiction forget what it’s like to be normal, normal is hard when you can put up mask you can hide behind, then I think 🤔 who is really living life the wrong way you or me

I am here at 3:30 a.m. bc my nephew is currently fighting his demons and just came home after partying for a day and a half. Spent the whole day looking for him, unable to get in touch with him (he broke his phone), calling police stations and hospitals, family and friends. Then he just shows up, sitting on the back porch looking awful. I'm struggling with what to do. I don't want to turn my back on him, but I also don't want to spend my days worrying/waiting for him to get his life together. Please pray for him. I'm so scared he's going to lose this battle 😢
Yo I listen to this song 50,000 times
This hits different for me I was the one making excuses 😢
i hate drugs
I feel this song so much about my kids dad. 10 years and 4 kids and to lose that to drugs hurts so bad.

I start naltrexone tomorrow. I gotta get better for my loved ones and everyone else that’s been here for me.
Dank these comments are crazy and got to me…. I hope every single one of you is doing okay or getting better bless all of you and your families
The second I heard this song I cried and watched it on repeat, the next day I got help and now been sober for almost a year!! It’s crazy how one song out of hundreds about addiction got ahold of my heart and it hit me immediately. I went to my plugs house and gave him $100 and he said what’s this for? I said this is for you to never answer my calls or texts again. I tested it. He kept his word! This song was SO deep! All I can say is THANK YOU #Jellyroll and #Joyner for making this song! I hope it helps so many more people like it did for me!
Not a good harmonic combo. I liked Jelly Roll’s part but not Alicia Keys. Sorry not sorry; I’m a fan of AK but not this song.
REAL WALKIN
Addiction is a disease but not an excuse, this song hits hard when your in recovery from drug abuse. I will always be in recovery the rest of my life due to hard drug use, I have been clean almost 10 years now and I still get cravings. I have chosen a hard life but I never use it as an excuse.
Damn another one Joyner just tells the truth of life. I’m in. Tears in the parking lot of work listening to this before I go in. I was about to celebrate two years sober next week. ____Is it not a disease and just an excuse. Idk but I’m still here fighting and I hope anyone struggling with addiction or a love one finds the peace they all truly deserve like myself.

On August 18th I lost my brother to his addiction the pain is on the whole another level the pain is real I don't know if I could live without him... 💔
I finally quit hiding my addiction & asked for help. I realized how much of a piece of shit Iam. The people who I thought I could lean on, are the ones who turned thier backs on me & make me wonder why I asked for help. It's dark out here & I'm fading away.

I know you will probably never see this. But I want to say over the years it has been amazing to watch you grow. Your Grandmother Mrs. Eartha played a huge part in saving my life 10 years ago when I was at the shelter. And listening to your music continues to help me grow. ❤
Wish my brother could hear this song now he stuck in the pen cuz the choices he makes wish he ould be a better perosn

2:08 Fuck, this is hard. I got diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis at 15 (A stomach disease that affects your weight, causes severe pain, bloody stools, so much more) and from the moment of my diagnosis, suffering through severe pain in high school tiny as shit because anytime I ate, I had to run to the bathroom 10x after eating a bite so the only thing that helped was pain medication because my insurance company wouldn’t cover biologic medication, a chemotherapy drug to help put my disease in remission because it was $25,000 per dose and I needed it every 4 weeks; but the insurance company disagreed. The only way I was ever able to eat was when I took my medication. Fast forward 15 years, 4 stomach perforations, the severity of the flare ups always causing me to be in the hospital & my disease turned into colorectal cancer so they had to remove my colon and rectum, and while it removed the cancer, I still have Crohn’s disease and still suffer with all the struggles as before, only now I have a colostomy bag and the only thing that ever helped was my medication but every time I took them, my brothers (Who are all drug dealers, addicts in their own right) get high just for getting high but call me an addict because the only thing that ever helped was my pain medication and make opinions that it’s okay for them to get high just to get high and even though they’ll snort coke, smoke wax, I’m the addict for taking medication for my disease. I’ll be 30 august 30th and truth be told, I’m ready for my life to be over.

Rich homie quan death stirred up all the demons I’d been doing a good job of pushing back lately. Came back to this to remind myself
It’s really sad that you put his out to further confuse people on addiction. It absolutely IS a disease. Calling it that doesn’t make it an excuse to keep using, it just explains why people who put using above everything else in their lives do it. Now you are just giving ammunition to people that say people who are addicts don’t have the “will power” or they are “weak” when in reality they have a mental illness which is a DISEASE that they need to learn about and understand how to treat it to overcome it. Every person’s solution is different but it’s no different than a diabetic needing to take insulin, metformin, diet, or all of the above. Guilt tripping people for using does nothing but drives them further into using. Do better.   - Sober and Free for 4 Years

I love both sides and how awful these drugs destroy our lives. Wonderful lyrics and video!!
This song really touches my soul. I’ve had to witness my parents and siblings go down this path and the pain I feel because I’m not able to help them out of their addictions and life choices. It’s hard. God is the only reason I broke the generational curse in my family.

54 days sober and counting as of 9/4 never thought I’d get here! If your still out there and want out I promise it can be done you can do it !
The amount this hits home for me and my life. Anyone still struggling like me just remember there are loyal people out there that will do anything to help you and I get back to how we were before we made the wrong choice ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love all of you
I never thought I'd be one to get addicted. I've lost so many to it. But I got down and tried a pain pill. Next thing you know. 5+ years flew by. I'm better now. Still don't think it's a disease. But I pray everyone finds their way and gets back to their families. And takes control of their life and finally be happy. It's possible. You gotta want it more than the drugs tho. Blessings and love to anyone and everyone stuck in the cycle. My dad always said." Don't do them. You might love them"
Yes Jesus is powerful and I just love the music a lot of motivational to continue my walk with God

How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 1: Joyner Lucas] Yeah, I got somebody I love (Yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (Damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (Yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (Woah) But I wrotе this song in hopes when they'll hеar it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it enough (Woah) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (Damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and you makin' feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (Do what you might, woah) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (Tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (Lose it) And you wan' deny all about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 2: Joyner Lucas] Look, I know you been callin' for me (Yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long, I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (Uh) How do I look go of something I know is something is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (Nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, I'm tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?

I love skylar grey but why has Eminems flow fell off and sounds so generic now. It seems so lazy at times..like it's a freestyle.    Sorry em, i know u read comments because youre crazy like that...but youe flow is very inconsistent nowadays. Wtf. Try harder please. Youre the goat right? Well wtf is this?  Either too many syllables crammed in a bar or not enough...and then u pick someone save me for the next single...bad choice imo ..its just not at all original using two covers for both singles. Idk. I think Eminem may have truly lost what made him so special. I know i know... people will hate my comment but as much as i wanna love this new album its pretty generic for an Eminem album. Its better then revival maybe but its not at all standing up to his older albums. Its like he just cant get there even though hes trying hard.
* jellyrolls verse got me in goosbumps...it's a very powerful statement!

I just lost my son from a broken heart and a drug that you talk about he is with the Lord. His mother.❤❤🎉
Strong
I love everything about this man, his talent, his perspective, his realism and his undying passion for his kids. He made the choice to fight the addiction for his kids. My mother couldn’t, she wasn’t as strong and eventually took her own life. There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about what she missed. And now, seeing the same thing happen to my kids with my ex… there are no words. This song just hits on so many levels. Thank you for sharing… maybe, just maybe, it will reach someone and give them the strength my mother didn’t have.
Somg save me so much 🤧😖

Just sent this to my mother and my stepdad, I watched them have everything and just are loosing it!! Step father was a big time cocaine dealer... It was all fun and games till someone showed him how to cook it up... Now they are crack users! Losing everything.. I tried to use my voice but I'm praying Joyner and jelly roll can tell them how I'm feeling... Being that I'm in recovery myself... It's just ironic because this is the same they told me!
Sometimes certain songs play at the right time when you need to hear the message the most.
I am convinced Jelly Roll is a genius

I have 40 days sober from fentanyl, Xanax, and isotonitazene. This hit me like a brick. I'm trying my hardest here! Some people have completely written me off like I'm choosing to ruin my life. I hate that I was born with this disease
Song is to deep to any one goring through this keep your head up u can swim
Rate this yf 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
Addiction is not a disease I am so sick of people trying to use that excuse and this is coming from a ex heroin addict and an ex drunk
Mannnnnn this shit is insane the line I’m not gonna be what the fuck u want me to be like god decided for me and speaking of god how the fuck u knw all of the plans he’s gotten for me that hit hard
This song is too strong for a comment. I'm speechless. Love you brother:)
My song 😢😢😢😢Thank you!  He's off to the bar, makes me cry 😢 I needed this right now. Crybaby me😢❤❤❤❤❤❤
If you believe in them and let them know that, that can be the beginning of them believing in themself. External support from people you love is important and helps the process in moving forward.

I love this this song how can you not cry hearing this on a personal level and a level that relates to others that I know this hit hard

Slim shady is the rap God, Em is the rap Genius and Marshall is the heartbroken Dad who wasn't there for is kid's! This song makes try came from my eyes..
I just heard this on my Amazon and it hit me right in the gut. Someone I love dearly is struggling with addiction and this song represents us both ❤
so this is my moms acount and i listen to this and i really like it alot i used to smoke weed with my best friend but this song changed me a lot.
I like how nonchalant Joyner acts in the beginning compared to the emotional turmoil seen in the other guy, it kind of highlights that nobody but the addict truly understands the pain of addiction.

My mom battles addictions to pills till this first time I really took notice was when my dad passed in 06 I was 9 at the time. By that time it was already bad couple months later she got in a car crash and it crushed her leg and she started getting pain meds from doctors in her own name and it really spiraled out of control. Then they got where they wouldn't give her anymore so she started getting teeth pulled trying to get them that way and still to this day she will steal from anyone grandkids included not pay bills cry when she can't get what she wants spend her disability check till it's nothing left been in rehab twice.. this song is real but I can't let go it's my mom
Please do an album with Dax. You two would touch millions
This is dope🔥
Ayaaaa viva la drogaaaaa

Talk about hit your soul….oh God!
That hits hard in a beautiful way
This is deep dealing with someone who is or was addicted is a journey and I see the difference now with this person
I’m a 38 year old man battling alcoholism currently going through a divorce that second verse made me cry like a baby sounds like me talking to my ex wife
I’m in the process of loosing a best friend over addiction. We have been best friends since we were 8 years old,  now 31 years later I’m having to say goodbye to a truly good person that was fighting addiction.  Love you brother! Now you’re going to god where you will no longer fight these battles by yourself.   This song hits so hard. Thank you boys for making this song for others to hear!
ALLAH Will save you if u chose his path 🙏🏻
Who knew I needed to hear this to help me keep getting thru what I'm going thru when I was about to just give up brazy what just pop's up when you think of dropping off
Nice
This deep
I OVERDOSED on Wednesday and almost didn’t make it but God has a bigger plan 🙌🏻 I’m 2 days sober ❤

I love your music Videos, this song reminds me of I’m Sorry
Isnt  it funnry
My mom took multiple drugs and we ended up becoming homeless and we would sleep every night in a tent and she would sleep with guys in order to pay for crack, heroin, etc and it’s sad because I got taken from her and my dad has been the best he ever could for me ever since and I promise to my self everyday I will become someone some day to prove how bad she really messed up and sold her life away just for drugs and left me there
"I'm sorry " vibe 🖤✨
Both scenarios, brilliant ❤
This tore me down.....
"My heart,soul and mind is with you when i get high son, But my carcass is on a cowardly disease demonic battle when I'm not."                            –  Me❤️‍🩹👋🏻😢🏚🛣🚶🏻‍♂️
I lost my kid brother to addiction the night before he was supposed to to check in to rehab this hit to deep 😭😭😭
How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay? Yeah, I got somebody I love (yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (whoa) But I wrote this song in hopes when they'll hear it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it as much (whoa) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and makin' you feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (do what you might, whoa) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (lose it) And you in denial about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay? Look, I know you been callin' for me (yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (uh) How do I let go of something I know is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?
Firts time hearing this, i almost had a tear😢 hits hard
This isnt acoustic tho
Addiction is Real. But I believe just as one puts interest in anything, one has the ability to withdraw their interest anytime. May those struggling to quit their addiction succeed in their journey.
Song hits home.
I lost my brother in 2020 after he struggled for about 14 years with drug addiction. We were raised by our mother, a retired soldier, after our father passed away a long time ago. My brother also served in the military, but drugs ultimately derailed him. His struggles on the streets were incredibly tough, and addiction became his daily reality. We tried many ways to help him, but we were unsuccessful. In 2020, he was killed by a mob after being found stealing from someone's house early in the morning.   Rest in peace, brother. May your soul rest well forever; you will always be in our hearts.
This is one of those songs that will be saving a lot of lives.
Who is here still battling addiction. Fuck this song cut deep.
Damn Man ! This shit hits close to home for me 😢 .
its back and forth i hate it, why would i ever rate it
Thank you for everything you do! Means alot to people like myself who can relate to both sides. Reassurance that I’m not alone in this crazy world of temptation helps to look forward to tomorrow
Big fu**in track❤
You're wrong, that's not love man. It is a health issue, not a fun thing...
I been listening to this dude since before Haystak. He's come a long way and bro I'm proud. Don't ever look back....
I pray everyday for my son cause he is always high it breaks my heart and pray to God that he will help him find a way
I love how joyner always plays devils advocate

Garcia Dorothy Robinson Robert Young John
For everyone & everyday  getting sober ;&staying  sober is a choice everyday.
Addiction is a tremendous thing to overcome, it's not a disease , diabetes is a disease and diabetes can't be beaten by willpower alone.. addiction is more like a demon or something evil attacking you. However addiction can be overcome with God. Categorizing addiction as a disease is just an enabler.  This is from experience by the way. Now that I'm clean for 4 years, I shock myself how much heart has changed . I couldn't make myself steal from someone now , 4 years ago ...  I was a terrible person and I'm so opposite now thanks to God
I feel this song un my soul.
This shit broke me. Had no idea i had that pent up pain in me. As soon ad the addict verse came in i stsrted ugly crying out of nowhere. Havent been touched by a song like this in ages. Thank you 🙏 💯
Sucks that the audio doesn't line up with the video tho
🙏🏼🖤🩷
Just lost another friend...this shit hits so hard
The acting in this video is movie 🎬 level
I cried listening to this song. Joyner’s lyrics really hit hard for me…
This song and video.  Is an energy? There is so much love and emotion in this entire thing. I can't help.  But cry happy tears I can literally feel the love in this video❤🥹
Аванс много красива песен❤😅💌💝
Joyner’s music videos and their messages never miss you are world class and they will realize it soon thanks for the work og 🤞🏾🤙🏾
I apreciate you ♡ thank you for this song.
🔥🔥🔥 Bruhhhh. you’re one hell of an artist. The bars and the vocals.. Slayed the song 🎶
Knew someone
"I know you ain't say any names, but I have a feeling you talkin' to me."
“I feel like the drugs were made for sitting that’s why I’ve been stuck in the same position” 💔 hit hard…
Never been a mgk fan but the feature with Jelly Roll is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
12 days sober today. Thank you, Jesus, and thank you, brother Ray, you saved my life.
Tell me is it really love if you have to ask them to stay?💔
Feel like I'm Sober now, i was never addicted to anything
Just shared to my wife we been married 2 years together for 7 going strong
If you don’t believe in yourself,you can’t believe when someone is believing in you . Hardest verse in the song
I made it 32 days and broke. I went back to drinking. But I reached out to my one true friend, to let them know I appreciated them for helping me, for being the only one to listen to me. They saved me, they saved my two daughters father. I can't count the times I had thought, my daughters deserve a better man in their life then their biological father. My wife deserves a man who has his shit together better than I do. Your line "I drank for fun, drank at functions, then drank to function" put my head in my hands. That's when I realized I don't remember my oldest daughters last 3 birthdays. I may have broke, but your music is gonna make me try again, for my daughters, for the one friend who cared, and for my wife who picked me up when I was at my absolute lowest point.
Life is fucked but I've 4yrs clean, it's been so tough tho. I got blessed with a beautiful daughter and wife that ride better then anyone. But it was easier on drugs everyday now I grew up and honestly it's been real tough, it's never enough. But I didn't get high  so positive has to be coming.
❤❤❤❤❤
Anyone who is struggling with anything. I love you ❤️

This song is exactly what my relationship with my brother is like. It reminds me of him everything I listen to it. We don't even talk anymore.
I just lost my mother to addiction this song hit me hard

I win against Thee Lord one Time and Nun Other

🩶🩶🩶🩶
I myself was an addict for a long time and it took me hitting rock-bottom and having to save someone for me to realize it’s time to get out And have my brother come save me and take me for help I am now sober it’s only been since July 30, 2024 and it feels great to finally be out and be clean and continue in the right direction
I'm an alcoholic an this shit hits home
Bro Jelly Road said he’d love to work with Joyner on Flagrant and like 2 weeks later they made this happen.. damn and I love both of y’all love this cuz I’m in a rehab. Joyner Lucas is fire with the dual perspective music truly amazing and creative…
This song brings onions to me anytime it comes on, 😢
This song is SO AMAZING! I wish my sister would listen to it.  Like listen to every word of it. Sara Marcy.... if you're out there... just know that I still love you, and there's nothing that could change that.
T
Wow
This song hits pretty deep for me having a brother struggle with addiction. I could relate so well. I’m choked up even typing this.
Me and wife been very abusive to each other i moved out got an apartment and i been playing this song every time i feel down and want to move back in with her just to see my kids but this song helps me
Taking me back  to the first time I stepped into recovery.....❤❤❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Omg this song. Dear god tears just fallen
*Embrace the vape life with our diverse flavors*
This song is triggering if you've lived both sides of addiction. I've been the addict & now the recovered addict dealing with an addict. The 2nd verse, how the addict feels, is triggering AF! As an addict, we tend to be entitled and unforgiving to those who put up with us. Someone who cares about an addict will decide they can only be there for you when you're trying to get clean. It's not our place to love you to death. That's a figure of speech, not a reality anyone wants to live with.  So anyone reading this that's still an addict, get your shit together! Addiction has a cure it's called sobriety.  YOUR DISEASE IS CURABLE. 🩷
How can you love someone and learn to let them go is a real question. I struggle with it daily. My wife is an addict and has been for a while now. My love for her is the reason I stay. It's the reason I can't give up on her. Most days she has no interest in getting clean but once in a while she shows me that there is hope. My common sense as well as my friends tell me it's time to leave and put myself first. I honestly don't know how to do that. I feel like my leaving would be signing her death sentence.
Beautiful ❤❤❤❤
Still listening in August ❤
This is such a beautiful song. Joyner Lucas really master the art of putting emotion in his voice. I got chill during the second verse.❤🔥
Jesus loves every single one of you, struggling and thriving. Turn to jesus christ and your questions will be answered. I love you all. Stay strong
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This!!! Commenting to remind me later
Hard to swallow. 😢
I’m going through addiction right now and this song is saving my life right now
This song is the truth hands down
talk about timing, holy shit....
God's calling Joyner Lucas
Awwww Beautiful piece. Your lyrics are very fruitful ❤
I hope people get to experience ALL your music(even the hidden gems) because they are all good enough to get up there! Your gonna BLOW UP! Like right now! Hold on for the ride! Never 4get ur roots! An original fans!😘💪✌️
I’m bad with my little sissy. This hurts so much
I listen to this song and it neautiful❤❤❤❤
I love how Joyner always tells both sides of the story!!!!!
❤ ya got my votes  again today 🙏🙏🚀🚀
4:23 if only this was around back in 2007, possibly could have kept several of my friends and tons of acquaintances alive and a hell of a lot more, along with myself off that garbage.
This tune is so catchy and uplifting.
Yo... Imma hood n****.  (Not a gang member or criminal) and i got turned up to this song watching YT shorts. The piano guy and 14yr girl, she won UK juniors or something 🤷🏾‍♂️. Idk but it slapped. So I'm here groovin and turnin my ppls up to diversity. The world is embracing rap music and falling in love with black culture, as im venturing out of it to listen to other cultural musicians. 👍🏾
I love that someone can say the truth about addiction it really is a struggle for people and hearing people talk about it is amazing ❤
Play this song on all platforms 🇯🇲🇺🇸🤦🏾‍♂️🦅🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Stand for this country … 😊
I have 6 months clean coming up on 7 months on the 20th, I never imagined getting clean I thought it was taking my life...then I found out I was 3½ months pregnant. That is what changed my life! I get cravings here and there. But I look at my baby boy and realize it's not only me in the car anymore. I got a whole nother life to care for and raise him without seeing that life like I did!🥹 he was my blessing in disguise! And this song definitely brought tears to my eyes!
this really helping me get through my addiction man...   cant listen to it without cryin but i guess the truth hurts :/
Things we never know!!
“IF YOU DONT BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, THEN YOULL NEVER BELIEVE NOBODY BELIEVING IN YOU”  - Goooose………… Bumps..
This song is so real but regardless just be there for the person who is stuck in their addiction don't judge him just pray for him and be there for him no matter what. Addiction is a powerful thing to overcome so have  patience with the person never give up on him or her people can change because I have changed. So miracles are possible through the grace of God. All things are possible with just a little faith.
That's amazing!!! Congratulations my husband and I are currently in a recovery program we have four beautiful boys to stay sober for. This recovery program saved our lives the most importantly our boys saved our lives. We've been clean and sober for over 2 years now...
I wish i knew how to help my wife shes left our kids and i behind for drugs why are they better then us how can they be more important then our children....
This is awesome. You touched both sides. Amazing.   I need to share this.
im afraid to quit drinking..
Just found this too real 💯💯💚❤️ thank you
August 28th will make 3 years clean and sober for me and my drug of choice was spending all/ heroin. I lost my husband of 16 years to a fentanyl overdose instead of going further into my addiction. When that happened I made the decision to get clean and sober. I was scared I would be next Best decision I ever made after you make it past the hard part of the withdrawals, it's all worth it
Ohh fuck what a Fucking twist. 😢
😢❤🔥😎💯
As a pill addict this song hurts so much 😢 I'm trying to recover though I been clean and bam addiction strikes
03:01
Thanks to God, my twelve step program and honesty on 7/16/24 i celebration 5 years of sobriety.
Hopsin did it first , But I fuck with Joyner
I love your music and your dreams came true 👍 for
Having an older brother that's fighting heroine and meth.. hurts deep man.
Wow.
❤ if u r also sick...
This is such a heavy and beautiful song at the same time
Anyone who’s struggling out there were rooting for you 🙏
The fact that my kids never have to live this life brings me so much happiness. I broke that generational curse on our family. I did it all for my kids.  Today i am 11 years sober.
I come back here everyday to better understand myself and the world in general. Thank you Joyner and Jelly Roll. The actor in this is phenomenal too!
There was a time I think some family and friends thought of me this way and now that I'm not off that BS I see people I love so much and feel this way for them drugs r so fD up maybe our so called government should focus on that rather than on who's this or that race and who does or doesmt like them itw killing us all direct or indirectly were all bn affected by this shit they're letting  in our streets
Real facts😢
So many years of my life lived in addiction. 33 months in recovery off of heroin. Clean date 11/2/21. #wedorecover
I love this song. Im no cry baby-bitch (im full grown) but this one always has me 😭 on the inside. Mizz u Ti (my other half) My bff💔☠️💀👻we don't even talk anymore. I hope my boo-thang makes it back2me 1day
i respect black people... dese r d peoplw who did evrthing 4 us
This song is so good and so truthful, the honesty it and I love the different point of views that you’ve been doing in these videos, they’re fire
I love how he went back after the video .
Feel me hard💥
Love jelly roll songs
We all know JL's lyrics & storytelling but Jelly voice was angelic ❤
Please please keep doing what you are doing this man don't miss and he is for sure undefeated Thanks for never switching up on us and please brother don't switch up stay you And I say all this because in my opinion you are one of the few artists out here today that's actually paying attention and listening to what the general public deals with on a day to day basis And I love how when you make music like this you give both sides to the story😢
Man I wish someone could teach me how to make music like that. My daughter would love it.
Jelly roll will do 1 push-up for each like this gets
Who cares man. It's good music! Truth hurts. 😆
Shit Lil Skies been a BEAST SINCE A YOUNGIN,  IM WAITING FOR 2025,2026,2027,2028 ......ETC HE THE ONE NOT THE TWO!
Man Dax... love yah man
Have managed to stay clean for 2 year's but my partner is still stuck in that horrible cycle but I'll keep helping him evreyone needs someone ❤
I am a niece.  And my uncle he does drugs and I feel like I loved him. He's my best friend, but I feel like I can't see him because he does bad stuff. I feel Like he can't be himself around me and it hurts me.
My love❤
I never been a emotional nigga but this bih jus touched me in ways my heart never been real shit cuz I can relate to both sides of this field
Talking rapping true emotions, its hard once the enemy gains control, we just vessels, good or evil, the  most high made us for a reason each their own destiny, spiritual warfare real! Daps and respect for these guys singing about dope and alchol taking souls, demoic possession is real and yah over see his kids, but satan got his too! ❤ 😮, peeps be sheeps not goats , wheres the good shepherd, in thine heart, if he knocked, who opened the door and who could close it????? 😨
Man I love y’all for making this song. Makes me really realize that’s it’s time for me to change
Is the actor that’s playing the addict, the same guy from nothing left at all music video?
Can't deny the talent. You should see all the homeless around our town with talent
man,           i  thought Joyner had it ....        this whole new album is just "meh"
Meth free  29yrs  thank you Jesus
Also, I must be living under a rock because today was the first time I’ve ever heard this song, and it came on the radio and I was just listening to it and the tears started flowing. I had no idea what I was about to hear but the timing and how I’ve been feeling they’re probably couldn’t of been a better time for me to hear it.    This is what good music sounds like that actually has a message and isn’t just a bunch of words rhyming but actually a strong message and story.     Two awesome artist, making a classic and judging by the views this is criminally slept on right now.
@JoynerLucasofficial I know you probably won’t ever see this but my brother is a huge follower/fan of yours and he was the first person to show me your music and over the years there are some songs you’ve done that I’ve liked but I absolutely love this song and this is by far the best song I’ve ever heard from you and the fact you collaborated with Jelly Roll whos song Save Me is one of my favorite songs of all time that when he released it and what I was going though in life not only could I relate to but it literally spoke to my heart and in a ironic way it was devastating and also therapeutic.  So with this song it’s like how others you’ve done when you show both perspectives of a issue and with me struggling with addiction of a very dangerous drug right now  in life it might as well been written with my own words because it’s a perfect representation of what I am going through.   I have never had a drug addiction that I wasn’t able to kick and stay off of when I decided too. I want to get my life back the way it was before I let this one get such a suffocating grip and it’s not just psychological but physicalIy it’s the worst pain and experience to get clean without being hospitalized or having some kind of medical help.    I want to change and get clean it’s just the pain and all the withdraws effects that are terrifying especially after I tried  last 2 time it was literally unbearable to the point I just don’t see how I can do it without serious medical help.   I probably am gonna get shit talked to me about writing all of this but hopefully not I just wanted to share how I felt about this song and what it means to me right now in life and hopefully it can give a semi glimpse to people who don’t understand what addiction feels like and the pressure and pain that are always present no matter the poison
I wish Jelly Roll & BunnyXO could have a baby ❤
Only 15 million
Damn it's mind-blowing what music can do to a soul,  wow, a forever masterpiece, that's what this is.  Sol III breathing indeed, what a masterpiece Joyner *fire just fire*
I love jelly roll voice on this song
Did you say the f s word
Damn this real af, both sides, sometimes there’s nothing you can do but move on from a relationship that’s gone stale
He dropped the beat. You know what that means. I cant help it. Its writing itself. It feels like it has to happen. And the video ia gonna be insane
heard this and quit the drugs🙏🏼 thank you for this masterpiece truly helped me connect with myself and heal… (2 and half months sober never thought ide get here only ways up from here)
For those that miss Eminem's old style of music like me we should be thankful for Joyner ❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Sorry brother love you!
Still the Greatest rapper ever
Dang man. Got them ole eye vapors hearing this. Hit home. Hit hard. How music is supposed to be. Thank you. God bless.
@trianajavar2821 I’m praying for him and my brother. But from experience I use to have addiction and it’s easy to try and be more understanding and react calm. Your brain is going everywhere at once. It could take months to be normal again
$$akmoney$$      joyner   luacs   jelly   rolll   hug
Joyner is really a genius 💯
My son sent me this song a couple weeks before died from alcohol abuse….😢😢😢
Dropping Tears when I listen to this hits home….
This would hep me to have some pushups, per like in this comment would make me done one pushup on each!
Powerful message. Just took my 38 year old son for the 3rd time to rehab. Heroin is a terrible drug!  He had me listen to this song right before we said goodbye!  Please pray he is willing to go through the hell of detox!  I keep playing this song   Helping me cope with the fear he will leave AMA again. Maybe the 3rd time will be the time he no longer is a prisoner to this drug!!❤

You’re loved and I’m glad you exist 💙
Stg this hit home 😢
Truth hurts bro every word is real😢
I lost my best friend May 9th 2024...and when I heard this song I cried for days because it hit so close to home...and I couldn't believe he didn't choose stay here with me and he chose his addiction over us but I learned that he was fighting to many demons I couldn't help him has much as I wanted I couldn't save him...but jelly rolls music helps me heal so much and the pain I have in my heart
5 years in recovery. I thank my wife for being able to stay by my side for the 10 years I was an addict.
Is this considered a good song by today's standards? I come from a time when an artist was someone with original ideas  (... lyrics, melodies,etc). I'd be embarrassed to put this out
This tune hits hard & especially when yr fighting some battles on yr own 😢
Oh he'll nah.... jelly roll boy I ain't know you sang like that😮😮😮😢😮😮😢😢
I love this song. I am a recovering addict. I got almost 3 years clean and sober and my drug of choice was fentanyl. I'm lucky to even be alive

I'm 35 and have lost 19 of those years locked up due to my addiction, currently in federal halfway house, just got out the feds doing a year and day violation for relapsing
❤ thank you for this rite here leaving a toxic relationship with someone who is a addict and this hits home. Had to let go for me and my sons bc they deserve a good life. Tired of carrying a guy when I only have 2 kids. ❤ ( another worcester resident appreciating you ty again)
Relate this to my dad
This guy just puts out soul touching music
"nobody is perfect not even me."
❤It's beautiful and True
Thank you. Aside from the fact I’m crying now, That’s all I want to say, thank you.
Man... Joyner... you are dropping hits after hits. This song is powerful as hell. I can't stop listening to this song.  A relatively new rapper rapping about actual personal experiences.   A legend in the making
this song keeps me going everyday.
Awesome 👍
0:27 ❤😂🎉😢😅😊
Ya know y’all playing but this shit is so real for so many!! Drugs will rob you of everything I’m very passionate about this because I lived it and survived to tell you about it!!!!!❤
I been clean for around eight years and I am so thankful I had a wonderful family and was raised in a Christian household it and the love by parents had for me brought me home to my young babies and omg I can’t even explain how grateful I am because I was throwing away such a beautiful life!!! I will never understand why GOD spared me but man I’m glad he did!!!
To anyone fighting drug addiction, I love you strong. You are a diamond in the rough. I can't tell you to quit. All I can do is say I love you and hope better for you.
Strong
I think u bought me some time and gave me some hope.... idk If my family will understand better but when u put both perspectives with ur fucking way with words man I almost don't wanna give up anymore joyner ur amazing man u know it but my dead heart feels some shit when I listen to ur shit
Lil Wayne says talk is cheap. Talk is still cheap.
A lot of people say shit but they don't mean that shit.
Will.
Moms been gone 4 years ! I’m four years in on addiction!! This song give me hope
You wouldn't understand this song if you don't know that song is about yourself 😢
This shit hard
Eminem BEST song   Pussies.

While im suffering non stop and they wont do anything for me and im just basically wasting away in my house in bed in pain having so many problems n when u cal n ask  for help bc sugars are going crazy bc i gound ouy of feom the high steriods im on and they disnt even explain it to me before they sent me home so the first week week i couldnt eat bc sugars sat in 400s w/out food just drinking water! And my oxygen was sitting in 70s n Bpm 180s but the hospital Doctots tolde 4 different tumes i called n told them just continue to do as discharged papers say,  i cried nbwas ready to guve up!

Wish they told me thev1st place 😢😢😢 wish theyvtold me alot wjsh theirbwasnt such heartless people sometimes n didnt guve up on someone whose only in their 30s n axrually help them!
This song cuts so deep. I’ve been sober now for 14 yrs 5 months. The struggle is REAL and it’s a battle that I fight DAILY. I have 2 beautiful daughters and wife that are my world. I couldn’t imagine what kind of pain they would have suffered if I stayed in that path. It gets better every single day. Trust in yourself and the inner strength you don’t think you have, it’s in there, you just gotta dig deeper.
I see you
❤
My brother is a Navy veteran of 10 years. The pandemic shut down the world while he was deployed in Okinawa. Meanwhile his wife and child were halfway across the world, and it fucked him up mentally. It started with binge drinking but slowly devolved into substances he couldn’t control.  4 years later, I see a shell of a man. I’m not perfect, Phillip. But I’m doing the best with what God has given me. I just wish you’d wake up and do right by your son.
I love this song. I am almost 3 years clean and sober
Lost my baby sister too!! The pain is real!! God please have mercy on the lost souls and all the family members that are left behind!!
It's not easy to get away from It if it was as easy as people who don't have a clue
I hope he can escape his demons, and get away clean, sometimes the pain of this world is too much, so we run to the devil for comfort and end up in deaths embrace.     There's no easy way to be bound and trapped, there's no easy way to say I'm weak and broken. There's no easy way to say, I'm weak and can't cope anyone anymore.   There's no easy way to say, I can't outrun my demons.  There's no easy way to say, I'm afraid too see clearly.    I'm afraid of the truth, I'm afraid of my truth.
They need to play this through a loud speaker in Kensington in Philly.
Ask Jesus to change you
This song is the absolute truth. This is how it is. 💯
The first time I heard this song it hit so hard for me!  Thank you!

Joyner is so talented man, I wish more people knew about him..
Yo this is real asf. Respect.
The song resonates with me a lot, I live with my aunt because of my drug addicted mother. Every time I try to have a relationship, she gives me reasons to shut her down. this hard bro.
This song is on a different emotion wave length

I have 2 years clean, I don't know you but I know the story. May God bless and keep you clean and sober ❤️.
Bout time someone said addiction isn't a disease its a choice
Y'all all act like i never killed my best friend before
Damn jelly roll vocals go hard. ❤
Awww im sorry
I appreciate this songs first verse due to its my pov of my spouses use over the years. I appreciate the second for the other side of the story.   Worst part is neither of us are understanding the other side.   I hate that I can't understand it even though I went through it years ago after I broke my hand. Been clean and stay away from the shit ever since. Shits rough
My sister died from addiction 😭😭😭
This song hit home for me
Om praying for you both, trust God
🫶🙏✝️
Woke up trying to figure out what to say to that certain someone who just can't seem to stay straight.  Omw to work this song popped up...... 🙏🙏🙏
That's so damn real...
I'm losing everything
As an alcoholic, I appreciate this.  Genuinely.  "Everyone calling that shit a disease... making you feel that you in the right..."  That hits home man.  Seriously.
I’ll tell everyone who will listen that this song hits every addicts family and every addicts heart. I’m going on 10 months clean of both alcohol and drugs after a long battle of over 13 years. But I promise for anyone who wants to be done with that life it’s totally worth it! I love you guys I might not know you or will never meet you but you have brother routing for you! Thank you Joyner and Jelly Roll you both are real men showing men what it’s like to be men!
Oh my God Jelly you da man! Bob Seger and Turn the Page I knew I loved you! My Daddy and I used to dance to turn the page Everytime it played, he drove a Coal Truck so it had some deep meaning for him and I sang it to him in a talent show I was told I could sing it if I placed in tryouts with a different song (Goodbye Earl) I placed 3rd and was allowed to sing it and I ran off the stage and jumped in his arms. I'll never forget it! He passed when I was 20 but he was my whole world. Every lil child deserves a Daddy like mine & that kind of love and security.
I was addectid 21 years....iam Clean now just take Methadon but i figth for my Love,he fall for this Devil 😈  I was homeless for years and was going thougth soo much . Now i dont know how i get that without dieing. I do everything to keep my love away from drugs but it it is a hard figth😢

I felt this song I almost lost a very special woman in my life it crushed me and heard this song instantly tears started to fall I love this song
Kick ass song 😊
94 days clean today ❤
Both these guys can't miss making tracks man I love to see it
This song, wow, I sent it to everyone I love and been through my battle with me.  My 73 yr old mother to my 26 and 21 children.... We all love it and say THANK YOU!
Lost my mom to alcohol and pills. I remember fighting for years with her about the way she lives, and i went public about it cussing her out and angry. a year later i apologized and i loved her but not even a week later she passed away alone and miserable. She had sat there for 3 days because everyone in her life got pushed away so no one checked on her. It was the worst thing i ever found and it pains me because i feel so robbed of a mother.
Hard song too many MISSED mates faces….harder when there faces  getting blurry😔
I'm ready😅
Wow. Just herd this in a way different light tonight.
god damn this is hard to watch as an addict. fuck
I pray whoever reads this that's struggling with addiction knows there's a way back just gotta stay strong 🙏 2yrs sober and going strong
This for the size 11s wearing 8s out there on the grind
😢
I'm a huge fan of Eminem but I saw in a reading that he does awhile ago and that they use AI ROBOT but the reason we don't see him too much is bc his clone almost has a mind of his own and doesn't want to cooperate! (Sounds like it's his spirit not letting them really use him lol) I'm SERIOUS A HUGE FAN AND WHY NO MUSIC VIDEOS ANYMORE? He worked way too hard to not stay in the game or be out in the spot light!
Thank you for this song. IT fits my life as if you wrote it for me. RESPECT “KEEP YA HEAD UP”
Porn is the greatest drug
I will never forget who I was in play hope you never forget about😊😊 please don't leave now because if you do don't break me again please I've been waiting for you forever ♾️ for the last six years I've been wanting and reaching out for you where are you 💕 I do believe in myself that's why I'm doing what I'm doing I'm leaving me baby please my friend I'm not denying and then I know what I'm doing wrong don't leave me alone again but you set alarm for 6 years don't leave me now

Addiction is so fuckin bizarre, I have been off an on sober the last 16 months. 2 months ago I was sober again for 6-7 weeks and thought, wow I have never felt better than I do right now, maybe I should get some drugs and feel even better. It has been a struggle again since then, every day tomorrow is the day, every tomorrow I find a reason it isn’t.
Thank you Joyner
This song been hitting different since I’ve been on both ends of this convo
Recovery is possible one day at a time.
F#@! you Joyner and f#@! you jelly this shit hit the heart.. thank you..
This song had me in tears 🥹
Absolutely 👍🏻
The relationship between me and my friend is falling off. He is an addict. Saw him two weeks ago.i wanted to take it out for a talk over couple of drinks . We were chilling and chatting about his addiction and before he disappeared and ran off with my 100 bucks. Still love the guy though.  😢
RIP WORM
Been clean for almost 5 years, still struggling with PTSD and I am bipolar I hope I heal and everyone else who is having longterm effects of substance abuse.
The game done fucked up. Em is mad and I love it!
Sober since 2020
Yeah this song is my story. I'm 2 years clean now and work with people that are struggling with addiction. For over 25 years of using in and out of prison i couldn't stop so i believe it is dieses. The only reason i stopped is because i found my mom dead of a drug overdose and i never want my son to find me that way.
I will do a push up for every like!!! Run it up! 💯💯💯💪
Lit song.   Much love
This song hurts my heart, rest in peace Richard Guzman, passed away in 2020 over Fentanyl
On and off drugs for 20 years I finally had enough of the ups and downs of addiction! Start with pills end up on Suboxone still very hard to quit, 8 days clean not turning back still in withdrawal but couple more days I’ll be free and I’m done
I’ll miss the love Kiki gave me I’m thankful for her, is the only lite in my fucked up life ,I let her light go I fucked up my life, life?????
O god😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
Joyner Lucas I love your work it’s amazing with a meaning not just I’m rich look at me that’s why I’m a fan of you but most of the newer artists are Judy’s beats and bullshit with no meaning
😢
Fucking A Thanks Man This A Real 1. About 2 Be 7 Year's Clean But Then My Mother Will Be Gone 7 Year's After That. But ❤❤❤❤❤Is My Power Now.
Yall are such an inspiration. Much love to yall 💗
Thank u from nz we need this
My brother is currently going through addiction right now. Our whole family has tried talking to him, the doctors are telling him he needs help but he keeps telling them and us he'll be alright even though he's OD'd multiple times he's in denial about the whole thing so this hits me really hard. If anyone can please tell me, what should I do to save my brother cause he's just not listening to anyone
Ryan Kelly 320 Veeder Ave, Schenectady, NY 12307  Anyone who is willing to write him,Ryan needs some positive vibes . This struggle is real and it takes a community ,Hope, ❤
My son is not locked up again...I am taking this time to bring food and blankets to the great people who found their life took a wrong course! My son is a addict but he is also a very loved human being! Love them when they are at their lowest! They need you more!
I lost my brother a year ago as of July 4th. This song is so very accurate and jelly really brings a powerful hook that drives home one of the most important questions an addict finds themselves asking. Once everyone had to turn their back I know my brother and so many others felt unloved and alone. But the verses tell the real story. The complexities between spending years wanting someone to see the decency in themselves and truly giving every last drop of care and hope they can even though they're angry, hurt, backstabbed. The issue of having to let go of the tethers holding someone together when all they want is to do right. All they want is the love which their addictions have corrupted. But at a certain point you have to live your life and let the chips fall. Because if you keep letting them cling to you, you will go down with them. Addiction is a true demon. Judge me if you wish. Trust me, I know there are a million things I could have and should have done differently. But I believe this execution couldn't be stayed. All addicts have a sense of loneliness that only another addict can truly understand. His was deeper than most. The only thing you can do is talk about it. Not the addiction, but the cause. Including myself I've never met an addict that wasn't using to cope with trauma. You have to heal in order to free yourself. Good luck to anyone reading this because if you're here you've been affected. Be strong, and be strong for the ones that need you. Rip Cody, I love you.
L I very yall this my stuff I'm trying figure it out
I've been addicted to meth for more than 30 years.... treatment after treatment detox after detox nothing ever works for me😢 I submit to my addiction and live each day hoping it isn't the last!
🔥🔥🔥👑❤️
I miss my baby sister Timara. Listening to this got me up in my feelers.
I really needed to hear this song , I’ve been struggling with my addiction for 11 yrs I keep relapsing I need prayers I been trying to stay sober but one day at a time .
All these important videos shows both sides of the battle
Love this song. I am three almost 3 years clean and sober and my drug of choices heroin/ fentanyl
Prime example of diabetes,   And lay of the autotune.
I need this beat and concept to write a  song to my teenage son. First time I heard this I cried baby tears. I pray my son forgives me and gives me a chance to be who both he AND I need me to be.💯😭😭😭😭
Lost my mother to addiction
I've been on heroine for 5 years since my finance passed away I was to weak to do life without her   I'm 10 days clean now and never ever fucking going back I can't believe I wasted so much of my life being numb   For me it was hitting rock bottom meeting a beautiful girl and realising fuckk I got a lot going for me and I'm a junkie I need to try more   I went clean with no help the only thing I've done is work out for ten days straight even though I'm still sick as a dog I won't give up won't go back   This song and music in general has helped me a lot thank you Jelly and Joyner
Lost 2 really good friends to addiction in the last 3 weeks. Been in residential treatment for 16 days, buried my homie the Tuesday before I got here and after 7 days in here found out one of my best friends relapsed and lost her life. I'm here learning to live my life different for them since they didn't get the chance. 1 PUSHUP FOR EVERY LIKE WITH VIDEO PROOF
It’s soooo sad 😢 😢😢😢
This a powerful song
I will not stop listanening to this song on July 6th. 2024.
Sent this to my mom who is a recovering addict and she said she loved it❤
35 years sober live in Crestview I hate it
❤️❤️💯
Thank YOU❤
Jelly roll i feel so much
No Joke This shit just brought tears to my eyes! ! The simple fact is I’ve been on both sides of the track. Jelly kills it! Another track Joyner showing he understands the plight of his City, his fans and family! This shit touches everyone! Simple fact is Music like this saves people’s lives and helps outsiders see what really inside! ✊🏻💪🏼💯

Joyner Lucas is top tier lyrically in this generation
joyner lucas music is prove the grammys are shit
The story telling of this man is insane much love fam❤
Angelina Sambrano this song is fitting.. may I please have contact with Faith
I know you won't see this brother, October 4th 2020 addiction took you from us, I wish you would have just talked to any of us and let us know you were struggling, by the time any of us knew it was too late.. I hope you're doing well, Dylan. I'll see you one day my guy ❤
2:10 frfr 💯 leave them , ..... Bye
I'm loving the thoughts that despite my selflessness yall we're the smart ones give yourselves a huge
I prat for you too
Love yall too.
It's been about 3-4 years now since I lost my cousin when she overdosed. I'll never forget the last thing she ever said to me, she came crying to me a night or 2 before it happened and told me she was cared of what she was gonna do (There was alot going on in her personal life at the time) and she said she felt comfortable coming to me because I wont tll everyone her business.....I almost feel responsible, like maybe if I would have told someone instead of talking to her and brushing it off she'd still be alive. She'd still be here with her kid laughing and smiling.......
Another masterpiece 🔥
This song makes me wanna DISS myself 😂
Joyners voice quickly turned to sandpaper to me and I was a fan for a long long time  Now he’s boring
This song should be the #1 on music everywhere 🗣️🗣️

I MISS MY SON SOOOO MUCH ON DAY’S LIKE THIS..8-27-95-1-21-21..LOVE & MISS YOU SOOOO MUCH DEVIN DAVONTAE RUCKER❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤
Found out an ex passed recently, we were both in a dark and destructive place during our relationship. We hadn't spoken for 5 years. I managed to get clean and through the years I heard of her struggles, and she reached out a couple of times but I had to put distance between us for both our sakes. I always hoped our paths would cross in the future and we would both be well and healthy. She passed in February this year and I get married this weekend.
This made me tear up. I remember having to cut off both my parents due to addiction. My mom finally got clean once she saw her kids were serious. My dad didn't he died in February due to Esophageal cancer from decades of drinking. His addiction finally took him out.  It's just not the way I imagined. Just because we let them go doesn't mean we love them any less.
Hits so hard
Love!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Heavy af, talkin to everybody with this.

R.I.p. to the wolf 🐺🐺🐺🐾🐾🐾
.. After months and months of begging and pleading and crying and screaming…     He didn’t seem to care. I have now decided it’s time to block him and just force on my 5month old daughter and myself. I got to do what’s best for us..  he refuses to even hear me out.. I can’t deal with the abuse and inconsistency.    We loved him so much. But that part of him is dead now.   Doubt you’ll ever see this but Adam G. I wish you luck. I’m sorry… we love you.. - your daughter Ellzie, and I.
❤
This is fire 🔥🔥

Ask the spirit that holds you. I hear a lot of these guys. But the worst thing is follow the music and follow the same mental style I love so many of these rappers connected to jelly but see it's all mental focused. The beats used to inspirer not make us accept our stupid ways.
24 of June passed 2 year clear off drugs. Not a lot of songs make my soul crumble. This one hit hard my heart. Cried during terrible flashback in my head. Great job. A lot of people need to hear this song.  For all the people that reading, stay away from drugs! At the start it is fun, but after you fall in the hole that takes your most important years away
Mannn.   Shit hits different when you can relate to this and it gives you strength to push just one more day!   🖤💔
Joyner is unbelievable rapper
On June 22, I went to the jelly roll concert n on June 27. 😢😢I lost my brother off an overdose on my birthday
Yoh! JOYNER is on space level. A different breed. Music storytelling is so captivating. All your albums are Gold to me brother. All the way from Africa.
You got me bro 😢….🫡💯  >>>>🔥IT’S FIRE!🔥
Jelly's voice on this is incredible 🔥🤘🏼
I wish my dad would’ve been able to beat addiction before he passed away ❤RIP Daddy
Instant goosebumps with this one! Such a powerful song!
If only it was as easy as this song
Nice song
Fire 🔥 song this shits hits home hard as fuck one of my best friends just od right before u put this song out i plan on doing a verse to it hope u like my shit when I do it
The way this man can tell a story and paint a picture with words is unmatched. A whole other lane that he's in!
It costs nothing to ask a person, are you ok??
WOW this hit me in a way I can't even explain. I have a person that is very dear to me struggling like this. Such a tough place to be in for both sides. Don't give up! 😭
joyner feat Yela wolf coming soon...2025❤
This hits so hard 😓
This song hits home. Joyner you don't miss!!!! For all real fans in here, if you took the visuals I'm Sorry and the impact mixed it in with the dialogue of I'm not a racist and the importance of that video. Put a unique and impactful voice of Jelly-Roll on it and You have Music Video of the Year imo. Great song great video. I'm glad I found Joyners music when I did back in 2015.🔥🔥🔥. I hope this helps bring across the message needed for someone in need of healing or help with they addiction 🙏💪🏾💯
Thanks, Joyner, You're always spitting truth and fire shout to jelly roll this song is amazing!!!
I've been an addict and I've been in love with an addict. I've lost loved ones to addiction. This song is so powerful and moving. I cried. Wow, it's raw and real, just wow.
Why does this song not have a Grammy? Or any type of award? This has to be the realest song I've ever heard..
Honestly one of my favorite artists of all time - this is real hip hop, this is art!!
This is hard for me to skip😭💯🙏🏻
❤
Joyner looks like Kevin Gates in this vid😮
Amazing joint🎉🎉
This song really hits home, it's hard to not get emotional every time I hear it
I hope this song brings thousands of addicted souls to the end of themselves, right at God's feet. Addiction is a dis-ease in mind and body from the DRUG drank, ingested, smoked, or injected. What started the curiosity? Peer pressure from fear or self-ISH-ness, self-sabotage, or trauma? All havoc on the mind and possible. We are here to worship and serve, but so many are worshipping and enslaved to chemically addictive drugs and serving themselves. 😔 I was there, too. Scary.
Keep up the good work ❤❤
This touched my soul. I felt this!! Thank you 🙏🏾 ❤❤
*I HAVE 16 YEARS CLEAN AND THIS SONG HITS HOME BECAUSE MY WIFE AND THE MOTHER OF MY TWO CHILDREN IS STILL OUT THERE RIPPING AND RUNNING GETTING HIGH* 😢😢😢
love for you all ;)
If you listen to “how can you love someone enough to let them go” you can really feel that in more than one way …..damn
Rest in peace to my brother, father and husband. Fuck fentanyl 😔
DAMN
I want to stop drinking but i cant. This sucks
Beautiful song Mr Joyner.  The song is a beam of light and away from the darkness.  Please do a remix with Mr NF.
I still don’t know what to do I can’t stop it’s all I know it sucks hearing stuff like this. Truth hurts I suppose. Just hope I can make it. Even tho the end sounds better most of the time. I’m writing this high right now hating my life .
If you be naija and come across this comment prove yourself by liking
this songs brings me peace and pain I just lost my sister to overdose I PRAY EVERYONE WHO IS WATCHING THIS AND IS STRUGGLING FINDS HEALING I PRAY HEALING OVER THE OTHERS WHO FEEL THE PAIN I FEEL RIGHT NOW I ASK GOD HOLDS US ALL A LITTLE CLOSER TODAY
Fuck this one hurts
Beautiful song keep it up brodie!
I am a survivor. My real father and my brother and my best friend were not so fortunate. That dope really kicks ass, I can't handle straight so now I just stick to the grass. I just thought that I'd let you know. That was great work. And it really hit home. R. I. P Boston
So much love for you two. And a never ending love for those battling demons and fighting addiction. Take your time to understand and love yourself. It’s worth it if you work it!! Much love to everyone
I am an addict and I struggle every single day with what's right and what's wrong and what's best for me fighting what feels good at the time. And honestly I do not feel good anymore I hate these feelings now it is just so i can function and will not be sick. This song opened my damn eyes to what I need to do. It is time for me to love me without all the crap I put in my body to help suppress the feelings of my life of trauma and abuse. I am 44 y/o It is time for me to stop making excuses or justifying. I got to do this for me so I can be the best me.
This song touch my soul
that number doesnt even let you leave a vm
Jeyrloll
My sister and my brother died from fentanyl overdose this song helped me cope with losing them thank u guys for this I met you at sxsw and you told me my  music would take me places &  shit hit different when you start to win you wasn’t lying
Still in active addiction, I left someone I loved back in April, we were beyond toxic for each other  we enabled each other, I had to let them go,I left everything behind I mean everything  I had to my name... He's  living in his car behind his mom's house,I'm up in a hotel room,was completely  homeless after I left him that rainy night I April, I want n need to get n b clean or ill b another soul who becomes  jaded and fades away into dust  who will end up just another long distant memory....
I wish I had understood addiction more before I lost my youngest son to it. I try to learn all I can and apply it with my oldest son who also battles addiction.
I am not a kid I'm a man
hhkthk🎉🎉
vijomc😂😂😢😢
The Rammstein shirt hit hard, that used to be me.  I've been an addict for 30 years now. This is such a hard watch for me, but so extremely powerful ❤
I've been an addict for 30 years now. This is such a hard watch for me, but so extremely powerful ❤
Me and my best friend are going through some hardships right now. And we are both strong but sometimes weak-minded we have God to back us up I am 8 months clean God be with me for the rest of my life to keep me sober me and my best friend are being sober together by the grace of God this song has hit hard for me I can barely see through my tears right now typing but I want to say thank you to you jelly roll and Joyner Lucas for everything you've gone through and everything you're going to go through and the light of Jesus but these tears I have now are happy ones

He's got good music
Jesus christ🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
I lost a good friend of mine 3 years ago now. This song would have been amazing then lol. But fr though shit hurts. I hope anyone that's going through some sort of addiction over comes it. Yall are strong, you can do it. Fight, you have a lot of people here wishing you the best. More support than yall know. Fight and overcome. Stay here, someone needs you more than you know.
Sure am... love this song... means alot to me
Than you for being the vessel the messenger❤
2 years off coke
When the devil 👿 gets into your soul., climbing out of the devil's reach ......feel God's 💗.  And having a mentor thats reached the top is a must to stay clean ...   This is a top level hit my guys 🤙😉🤟🔥💯
There is music and then there is songs like this that are on a whole different level. This song can change lives!
I am currently losing her to this addiction. I've never felt worse, but it's been so bad and so long I stopped caring like I used to. She threatened her life while my phone was on airplane mode last night. I don't understand what I'm supposed to do now.
How does Joyner not have a Grammy yet?? This is a powerful song... f*ck hollywood... you don't need their recognition or a motherfuckin ribbon... Lucky You, got the fans to show love, support and appreciation...
Thank you. <3
This right here hits home. These men here Beast
This is deep I'm tearing up cause it's what I'm experiencing at the moment
Damn... thinking of my older sister who recently passed away from.... this 😢
Joyner Lucas you are a gift to the rap community. Please don't forget that
Why didn't Jelly Roll get a verse? Instead he chorus, and it wasn't even that many words. Love the song BTW, but if you have a talented musician, you should use them. That's all I gotta say. Much love. Recovery is possible. ❤
I want to see Joyner reach out and do a collab with Lukas Graham! This one just proves how fire that track could be
Don't let addiction ruin ure life 😢😢
"Im Not Racist" version 1.5
That chorus is 🔥💯🔥💯🔥
The amount of efx and reverb on this man’s voice is actually insane lol
This is one of if not the best song I've ever heard and it hits deep even though I've never had a drug addiction or a major life changing addiction except maybe YouTube but again this if it's not the best song its definitely was the most beautiful keep up the great work also this was one of the two songs I've had such a emotional reaction to
I loved this song
I ranted I spoke I bleed in the comments but don't have it in me , good luck I miss you brother .
Mann this has me crying. This song hits when you have family who's addicted to hard drugs & alcohol frfr. If ykyk😩😩💯💯☝☝😭😭💔💔💪💪🎗🎗🙏🙏🙏
I saw Joyner live in LA, I teared up when he performed. He really knows how to relate to the people in their darkest places. Thankyou for what you do Joyner keep up the work that you do.
Damn😢.....

Prayers for anyone who is battaling addiction. Im coming up on 4 years clean, its possible to get clean and very much worth it
Love you and Jelly Roll's music love your voices together and the music to this song 🎵also the lyrics
"HOW CAN I?"  How can I  How can I How can I keep you next to me How can I  keep you loving me can't you see can't you see this isn't How it's supposed to be you keep telling me you love me but you keep saying your going to leave me in the next breath you take come on we can make it through can't you see your the best thing that ever happened to me can't you just can't you just be with me give me a chance wait wait show me some romance yeah. So tell me baby tell me let me see what I can do what we can do together as one damn remember all the fun we had is it really that bad and sad now how how how did it become like this to you ? How can I  how can I keep going on and on and on when you know that you're the one that keeps pushing me away what can I say or do what can we do together to storm through all this crazy weather? How can I oh how can I keep listening to you saying your leaving me and then I'll see what I had if only all these words weren't so sad why does love have to hurt so bad? How can I  deal how can I feel? How can I  make you stay when all you want to say is you want to runaway? I  have just the kids and you what am I supposed to do? How can I keep going on how can I listen to what you say if all it's going to do is hurt me anyway any day now you may be gone then what huh should I keep going on?How can I how can I how can we keep our relationship together how can we make it better how can I be the only one who is trying and crying? How can I  keep you tell me baby cause I'm at the end of my rope I just want to keep the hope so tell me if you know something I don't show me that you care look at me don't beware just stare damn I guess it's just not fair pay attention listen close here how can I  put it all together come on baby how how how can I  cause after all I made the fall you took the call are we heading for the long haul that's right after all isn't it supposed to be you and me us we so as I said before don't want to close this door just don't want no hurt no more how can I? That's right not how can I  it's we can't you see it's not just supposed to be me in this relationship it's we not just me so how can we how can we fix this mix this put bricks in this house to make this relationship sturdy not too dirty if you love me isn't it worth the wait worth the time worth reading this rhyme didn't you tell me you'd be with me forever and ever was it all lies or a crock of s$it hopefully off all this bull s$it going on I just wrote a killer stealer song but seriously is it just me how can I how can I make you see in actuality it's supposed to be we yeah seriously in actuality it's supposed to be We. Song by: Dawna Hayes feel free to read it all the way through maybe one day I'll make it big time from it maybe not at least someone hopefully read through and sang my song of my thoughts, emotions, feelings, and looked at what I had to say today hopefully this is helping someone else maybe me maybe you too!
Shits made me cry I'm over 2 years clean it was hell ruined a lot in my life with drugs
As an addict, the addicts part pisses me off!!! Bla bla bla typical junkie guilt trip and gaslighting! Unno if that's the point but my eyes rolled so far into back of my head.
My biological father has struggled with drugs and alcohol for as long as i can remember causing him to be rageful and has taken his anger out physically on the people i love the most, hes been to rehab but didnt have the strength the fight his addiction, i blamed myself wondering if wasn't doing everything thing I could to help him fight his demons cause clearly he couldn't fight them on his own, i realized that i couldn't save him anymore and he had to save himself, there isnta day that goes by where i hope he knows i don't hate him, but i cant let this cycle continue so i pushed him outta my life so i could better myself and be the man i know i can be, but as a son it hurts having to push away someone who helped give you life but deep down i still pray that he'll change some day or ill be carrying him in a casket and that's the hardest thing any man can do
Joyner is so damn underrated.
JUST WANT TO CON YOU MAAN,,,ONE MAN THAT DE ITS YOU
Something nobody told me growing up was that rock bottom has a basement 😢. 40 months clean. 🇨🇦
❤God i just love jellys voice its amazing ill never get tired of hearing rap or sing hes so talented❤ the fact that hes so real, down to earth and humble makes me respect his music even more❤
I love this
AMAZING
First time i really got to see my family and friends struggle when I was active drug user  I have always said why do people are in my business i don't hurt nobody except myself and only today I'm starting to realize how much my addiction ruins not on me only me but anyone who loves me
Ughh, ok. A really fat man with ugly tattoos learned to express harmony with music and make a lot of money. I'm sure it's based off of goodness but that was a long time ago. Don't be fooled by this. Him and his wife are living a very high life and they are now playing off the emotions of our own innate realizations. Go and live your lives. Place a pause on your online media platforms and grow yourself. Music like this is good for the soul but it's better taken in small amounts from time to time. Be wise with the balance of hormonic energy you use.
😢this hits close to home! My son! Ty for this for those who judge!!
Joyner is not an artist but he's the real ART #never misses 🔥🔥
Fukn awesome song, yall 😢
Joyner and jelly roll my idol amazing feats
This song is so true
My brother this is the GREATEST thing I have seen in a very long time..the ending was the best part of all.. thx for  letting the world inside your amazing mind.
I LOVE YOU ERIC ERICKSON ALWAYS AND FOREVER!!!!  2019 - 2024
Addiction is so terrible, it ruins life’s.
I love this song
This song hit different. I'm on day 1 detoxing a fuck the shit is differnt now. I've lost everyone to this stupid shit. Hopefully I complete it this time. Thanks for this song!
I just love this man and ALL his music!! He is definitely someone I can relate to, and know that he's not looking down on me judging all and everything that I do. His lyrics how me deep down on empty soul!. At one time I felt it was over for me until I came acrossv one of house songs
I’ve been placed on controlled meds and I speak from my personal experience but mental health can play a major role on why people become addicted. It’s a battle and since I’ve been on my prescribed meds I’ve been feeling better. I am hurting tho because my family consider me a drug addict I’m just trying to better my life but I do not want to become addicted. I have no sense in direction and I’ve been going to therapy but at this point I don’t know what’s wrong and what’s right. I just feel like nobody understands how hard it is to deal with PTSD and ADHD, Anxiety and Depression
Thank you Joyner
Deep 🙏🏽
Worcester represents for you Joyner, keep killin it
tru
I will do 25 push ups for every like i get brother❤ i need to break this addiction😪
First time I heard this song I thought people were speaking to me through this song god friends my son heart mental state of mind
This one has so hard! Group around addict my whole life lost my brother to drugs! Trying to see a bright light at the end of the tunnel!
❤❤❤❤
Prayers to all of you struggling. You can do this keep up the good work 🙏🏽❤️
💕🕊️ if she was here today 💕 i'd love to send her the link 🥲 Joyner , you did good here
So RELATABLE! Thank you!!! 😢
damn

Addicted to fentanyl losing everything 😞 my family and myself and no one knows I can’t stop crying rn 💔💀 I need help
Made me cry stg😭🙂💯
. ❤
Just rediscovered Joyner after listening to 3 little pigs. I didnt expect to be chokeing up, thinking about my dad that i recently lost due to the fent. Nonetheless, great song but fuck do it hurt.
https://youtu.be/sHvK5iuwlrY?feature=shared
Like this if your sober and happy
That “how come you only there for me when I try to get clean” hit hard
I quit drugs a month ago changed city lost all of my friend thinking I was going to get better but for now it only kept getting worst...
I sent this to my big brother now he's coming around again he was on meth for a while
This song is deep!!!!!❤ ON point !!!
The message behind this is deep mental health causes addiction because we don’t give it enough attention before it’s too late 😔
stoop fuckin with them western medicine dr.'s
💪🎙️💯🎈
Yo Jelly Roll killed this hook like bodied it wtf 😮 Joyner really gotta be protected at all cost 😤🙏🏾💪🏾
I will get through this ❤
I'm trying to believe love and imperfectionsare Gods and so are we
Idk how this song could have been better articulated. I love this shit and feel it with every bone
Big caseho

Very very bad I don't agree with you...The only and only purpose of life is only God.. the bestest addiction on earth in the whole universe is only and only god.. Yes we all are here to do a part of life on the besis on us past karma...We don't know what we have done in past life.. We all are hear and see todays lifes don't we.. some were child born and get suddenly dead so this is also the part of our remaining karma by gods will.. We all are the power souls of the gods devine supprem power  energy.. Dare to do wrong things just feel the god feel love naa.. We all are brave this is the part of life we can handle this bravely don't do those things which we are forget about god naa.. don't do that kahin aisa naa ho in which lost our senses to feel the god supreme power the energy.. come on we are not a losser we are brave brave brave.. life tension..finghting and yes love.. detachment.. sexaul arousal.. we are not slaves of these things.. don't do that.. God bless🙏🙏🙏🥰🥰❤️❤️
This is a really a home run song
I pray everyone addicted to heroin is able to escape with their life like I have. 4 years now and I feel just as guilty as the day my friends died, especially cause we had a fight before they overdosed, I never got to say sorry to them, and it sucks. Stop pitying yourself if you're caught up in the cycle and save yourself. Not to do so is selfish, imagine the feeling they'll have to live with when the dope takes you, it's honestly the worst part, knowing their families have to hurt and I was just as guilty as them. There is a better way, takes time, but if you stop making excuses, you can beat it too.
Day 1 for me
His voice is amazing❤
LORD!  This has truly touched me.  This is me and my sister. Lord help us all! Amen
❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
let me get a like for anyone who has lost someone to addiction or ended up in addiction themselves .......💔💯 #WEARESTRONGERTHENTHIS
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
And what about people that just have issues that a striking amount of people have. Drink a little bit too much. Or try to cope a little much. Only to be completely cut off from their children.... knowing deep down they want to be there to make sure their children don't do the same. Or that is better to have a parent there who loves you and does as much as they can for you as opposed to not having that parent at all.... end the cycle... Women/ mothers... please don't do this to our/ your children. I say women cause more than anything they are the ones bitter and keeping children from great, good, decent, and at the very least adequate fathers. Better that than no father at all. Even if all they get is who they don't want to be like. Bring back fathers or humanity will continue to fall.
Que maldito temazo! ✨
No alcohol in four years. Stay strong, guys. It’s possible.
Joyner I know you might not see this but I was at a jelly roll concert tonight and I tried to pass this to him but I don’t think it’ll get there so here we go. I am a start up artist looking for some kind of connection to get my name out there. I have had no luck reaching out to labels because no one is willing to work with a newbie. All I need is an opening and from there I promise everyone that my name will not be forgotten
If i had 24 hrs its simple id run to every house i had simple realionship with and let it go... fuck all these friends and family. They hate me
rest in peace, Paige... i'll hold you in my heart and my mind forever.
Too many souls lost too early!
3.5 years clean it is a long road worth taking! The fog is gone at 41 life has finally started! To everyone who has found their way out hells yeah outstanding, that shart be your B***h! Alcohol was my catalyst find yours and never let it lower your inhibitions again!
Hitting home with me right now.......😢 Can't save them.....how do I walk away💔
This song hits, especially struggling
Dont you encourage dope dealin though, be real
You literally rap about drugs tho
Turning comments off is for washed clowns
I love joyner, and the way he puts his videos together.. top 3 in story tellers... epic sir! Epic!
I was addicted to fentanyl for 3 years came from a good house and family. I lost 2 of my closest friends. I'm now 8 months sober coming up to 9 in a few days. Stay strong guys. Get somewhere safe and clean and I'm not just drugs clean physically clean and white and clean and clean!!!! Do stuff exercise get in methadone and save ur life and travel and help others
I recently went through a relapse and got my first 24 back yesterday, and this was the first song I’ve heard since❤️❤️❤️❤️ hella deep and beautiful… people don’t truly understand how hard it is… keep passing this positive message!!!!  FUCK ADDICTION ❤️❤️❤️
I will get 123. Push-ups that gets every like and comment and subscribe.

One day at time. We can all do it. Thank Joyner. Tears 😭 while listening. Addiction can come in very different forms.
Em got u
Love your music
I've lost my too many people that were not close to me to addiction. Being an addict myself i really feel guilty to be here still. Hopefully I can beat it to find out what my purpose is
I like the song. It's so hard to watch someone u love destroy themselves with an addiction
Now thats a tune.
God...as an addict this song hits so hard...7 years cleans but I'm still fighting my battles...fuck....this shit is hard ...and I know it's hard to be the person on the outside too
Love this
I absolutely love this song! I'm 1 year and 6 months sober from opiates its been a hell of a journey but I'm so glad I did it it took an overdose and going to jail for me to finally realizes life is so much better without all that nonsense. For anyone struggling right now you can do it hang in there and keep pushing it'll get better
Damn bro your saying the realist truth about addiction what your saying is in my life right now and hearing your words broke my spirit bro about addiction damn bro........ I'm putting every body out that wants me to stop this shit ...thank u man
I was sober almost two years and just relapsed. Even after the od. Is it love if you'll have to ask if they stay ❤
Beautiful! 🖤

I am having a lot of problems with my daughter she's in jail been in jail for 2 years Life has been so rough for me I love this song I feel every bit of it
Shew!! I felt this in my soul.  Deep down in my soul❤ Thank you, thank you for this song and thank you for the continuous reminder that music is life.❤
I love that he still does music videos. Lost art ❤️
Love yall .. Scrolled to like 7 days ago. So many stories .. Love for our fallen. 😢
This song is so powerful, I've been clean for more than ten years, and this song still hit me right in the gut. It made me think about all the people I know who are still struggling with addiction. I can’t believe how many people have been touched by addiction and how many have lost their lives to it. Thank you, , for bringing us this important song.
Thank you for this ❤ helps alot. 🙏
Boss😢😢😢
I Dont like rapp all and this song is really good
I used to be the person this song would be about…..life does go on and u can finally look yourself in the mirror and tell ur self to be proud
Man this song is amazing,  I  was on 300 milligrams  of Moriphene  for 22 years after I  was  told I had a brain tumor  on my brain stem that was found  when I was  19 and had been growing  from  the  time  I  was  9 so it wa huge and I lived in Tallahassee FL but had to be taken to Shands  University Hospital  in Gainesville to be worked on by Dr. William Friedman who is still there  and at that time was the 3rd Neurosurgeon  in  the  world,  anyways  I  moved to  Warsaw Indiana and  now I'm on Methadone take homes and haven't touched  a needle or pain pill in Almost 11 years,  This November 25th will be 11 years  and yes when ppl tell u you have to change  ppl, places and things  it truly is a big difference  than trying to be in your  normal spots and  still being  able to quit the  things that have been  going on in the area you're still in for so long. Well I  moved 1,500.00 miles away from everything and everyone  I'd ever known and still stay  to myself  to this day. The one big down fall of Methadone as far my experience  has gone is all the weight ive gained from  it and I'm  not  joking when I tell you  I went from 139 pounds  to  290 pounds in a little under a year  which started  me on a bad health  issue  as well,  but I'm  serious,  I'd rather be fat and happy than on dope and  miserable ❤ Please  don't  ever  give up on  yourself,  it's  not  ever easy, but it's worth it  in tge end I promise 🎉
Felt every bit of this in my soul.
I’ve been on both sides of the couch, myself an alcoholic, and yet I judged the fuck out of my brother and his meth, shroom, an alcohol addiction. At times in my life I was worse than him but looked down on him because he was an outcast. I pray he finds whatever it is he’s looking for. Love you bro
Wow. Nailed it!
whos here after enchanting rip
This song! Never heard jelly roll before dude has a voice and Lucas way underrated
I told my partner too listen too this he's still struggling with addiction and this song made him sit and think ❤
This is the first time I’ve heard this song… tore me up… deep
I came across this song and I wanna do a version to this so thank you joyner lucas 🙏
Yoooo the hook 😭 the lyrics.... RIP Dad ❤️‍🩹💔..
Trust even after love will still be. As long as you don't force the change within love
Truthfully this song ended a great friendship kuz of wat was best for me and also helped me get rid of addiction #ThankYuhLucasJoyner
I see why this song got millions of views I'm dealing with a situation like this right now and I shouldn't even be f****** nice this s*** bang though.. we really need to start living better y'all and get off these sad songs and these hardcore ass songs even though that s*** always going to bang and this is life* 💯 Big Frontline612 Minnesota bound
Yall have no idea this shit saves me everyday and I been sober for 4 years.. I wish this song came out earlier..needed it then
The voice on the jelly roll is beautiful
I lost my uncle last week due to kidney failure. This song hits harder than I ever felt. I feel like the outcome could have been different buh it is what it is, I LOVE YOU JOYNER❤.
Is it famous yet? Find this randomly, no tiktok
Coming from an alcoholic addict. That line about using the disease as an excuse... fuck. That literally fucking recovered me. I have spent years in AA where you never recover. I can literally drink like a normal now. I have poured out more than I've drank and can barely finish a beer. When I let go of that excuse I beat the demon at his own game. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
i have been over 3 years clean and i have started after my grandma died in 2019 , i had to save myself because i knew she wouldnt want me to keep shootng up meth , i still miss her and everyday feels like i still miss her and i dont tell my family because they dont really help me with my feelings
This describes my situation perfectly ❤
Imagine being able to relate to both sides, and yet never feel able to admit to it.
BEST WHITE RAPPER EVER!!! <3
Love this song...been on both ends of the story! Love you Jelly Roll!
This is joyner I like. Not the one talking about guns and Bitxes ...
Broski os better than this
12 years of opioid and benzo addiction. 94 days sober
❤❤❤❤❤🪶🪶🪶🪶💪💪💪💪💪
I'm putting this comment here so that every time someone likes this, I can come back to the song and listen to it
Grammy type song
One thing about Joyner is that his music always hit home. Lost my dad in 2015 to heroin , even the old songs , nothing like you , im sorry , even ultrasound made me be a better father.
The double meaning behind this song is so unique and amazing. This is Joyner’s message to hip hop and hip hop’s response but it’s also a personal piece as well. This is what you call ART. 🔥
This song had me bawling 😭🙏... powerful 💯
His dad's verse gets to me so much in this so much..
This got me thinking of my ex. And my ex after that probably thinking of me.🫠
Im wasting my way in alcohol and i cant tell anyone
This song was dedicated to me from my homeboy and it changed me cus it hit deep and so far been clean for two months after a 18 year run on heroin much love music like this with this message is gold
Joyner and jelly thank you this hits deep and helps me fight love you guys!!!!!
I pray that everyone fighting this dam demon of ANY addiction you overcome...we do recover ...May the Lord wrap his healing hands over your. Heart & soul... The Devil is A Liar My Luv...much luv ,peace happiness you deserve all the good things in life ..Amen ✨❤️‍🩹🙌
Insane song made by joyner and jelly roll its FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Some ppl will never understand this feeling fr.... I love my brother n at 1 point I was there with him. But I grew up n he stayed stuck. I hope he soon realizes we all here. N if he don't see what everyone else says he sees me n listens to me cuz I know n he knows I know personally I know his bs n I just know n I'm here for him with no judgement love u bro 💕 free my big bro
I fought that demon heroin 54 years ago l, woke up next to my baby boy who had died from SIDS. I believe he came here to get me to where I'm at today...I couldn't have done it without God.
I’m struggling with my addiction…..I was sober for 6 year. But I feel back into it….its hard
This song made me cry every time I hear it. It just fucked me up. This song is so beautiful. This is the best. Yeah good job guys.
This feel like my dad some times😢😢
love this
Just let go, lots of good people out here struggling and offing themselves. Who gives a fk about a backstabbing tweaker. I know if I ran into my tweaker ass dad I'd only wanna try to throw hands. He can't fight anymore so he keeps a couple shanks.
My god this song 🔥🥹🙏
Hot 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
my dad used meth for like 3 years  when I was 3 and he bean sober for 9 years now
Honestly, me 💯. You hit home for me in a way I never understood before. Thanks for creating music that has meaning that most can not understand!!
I’m a recovering heroin addict but recently lost my soul mate best friend to his addiction. It’s been almost a year since he left and staying clean has been hard since he left but Ik he’s my guardian angel and will always be with me but the pain and the hurt will never leave me. Till my dying day his name will live on an everyone will know he wasn’t just an addict. Till we meet again Travis!!! I love u always

My 16 year old daughter is going through substance abuse since my mother passed away. Her best friend . It's been a struggle the last year. I hope see takes all the resources I've put in front of her to heart and comes around. I miss my baby girl
"You only there when I'm trying to get clean"....dam
Been clean from opiates for over 8 years and this song hits so hard for me. I'll never forget how terrified I was to get clean. I've lost so many people I loved to this disease. Please, if you need help and don't know where to turn, there is hope and help available. I'm proud as hell of you for making it through another day. Sending everyone who has ever battled this or loved someone who's fighting addiction, all the love and comfort I have in me. You're not alone💙
Addiction is bondage. Soul's who are detrimental to the enemy of God, are who the enemy of God attacks with the bondage of addiction ❤
I miss you my friend!!! 😢😭😭😭
Man.. every song is so relatable 😮‍💨
Love this hits home..
Something about music that is so much louder than our loved ones voices. We're all lost souls but some are truly in the depths. In 2023 went to two brothers funerals(4 months apart) due to fentanyl, this epidemic is becoming to much of a reality. Benjamin and Nathan Belcourt. I was fortunate to see Joyner live. Same with many artists(NF, Megadeath, Dr Fresch, ZHU, chris webby etc.). From the past i've come from would of never imagined. I've been clean for years now but MDMA really had it's grip on me. I'm in a position of life to be grateful for my loved ones being alive, which is a mindset we all forget about frequently. Gotta live your life with "Mind over matter cause if you don't mind, it doesn't matter" and if you do mind, you must make changes. There will be brighter days, but is within what you manifest. we are all frequencies and vibrations.
I about cried when i first heard this😢
His voice sounds just like Eminem
The song is really relatable you can tell he speaks from experience
This hits me so hard.
Just got out of rehab the 23rd I’m 48 days clean and forever grateful to still be here 🤞🏼and this song touches my soul 🩵
Listening in June 2024!! Love this song!! ❤❤❤
For about 2 years, i was addicted to alcohol and drugs currently been sober for 3 and a half years. It's def a blessing that i stopped and had friends and family to look up to and help me through the process of sobering up for anyone who is suffering from substance abuse. Just know you always have a choice
This one hit me right in the feels!!😭😭 Not sure what is harder, hearing the loved ones perspective or the addicts. As I understand both. #10yearsssober
Dam this a hit
Love this song
jelly rolls hits
My record "TRUTH" hit on the same subject. Addiction is a powerful thing. My heart goes out to those whose witnessed the ups and downs of a loved ones addiction. Its not easy overcoming addiction but it has to be un you to make the change. Be you transformed by the renewing of your mind.
I love this song it is really relatable.
Damn. This was deep and beautiful.
Best for me remix music  Jelly roll  Eminem  Bunnie xo
What a powerful song. Thank you for using the rap medium in a different way, to help people.
all i see is black and blue keep beating cause i expects something new fool im cruel drown myself in the pool while the heroin runs thru undeniable i aint cool despicable but carry weight like mule im useless unless im used as tool all this was is a place to vent i dont seek forgivness cause the harder i repnt the more sin i juwst make it be heaven scent i guess i wont know until im finally dead
my dad dont think he will  ever get off drugs and i miss him so much it kills me to see him into drugs so much this made me cry for him, i miss my old dad so much ....
Please, if you know someone who you love that’s suffering from addiction, Don’t give up on them, love them and be patient with them and try to understand what they’re going through, before it’s too late. Trust me, when they are gone, you will regret it! I know from experience🙏🏾🪽 To all those struggling with addiction, we love you and sorry for not showing it enough. Remember that Jesus loves you too and that it’s never too late 🙏🏾❤
We have to do better you’ll. They need us😪🪽🪽
You are brilliant. Wow. I just read the words of your verse on “Lucky You” and then found this. Don’t stop creating art like this. This is relevant now and may be relevant for many more generations to come. I love the dual story telling.
Best song on the radio ❤ I wish it played more
I got free from all the drugs ages ago, but please please give me the strength to stop this major alcohol addiction please god, I’m 29 and on the edge of death from liver cirrhosis from 5 years of binge drinking, would of had longer on the drugs, fuck alcohol I’ll be with you from it too soon nan💔
This song hits harddddddd
😢 I don't like how real every word is to me
I watched this video one night at a party. I have a shirt from the tour the guy on the floor has. I cried cause I pictured myself as that man. I went back and apologized to my brother I had a falling out with. I went and apologized to my mom. Thanks Lucas and Roll I made amends with my family because of this video.
❤❤❤ this song hits every part of my soul
Recovering  addict  1 year and 5 months 😢
Rap saves lives! Keep it 💯✝️  #Rapsaveslives RIP 🪦
Hits home 😢
Joyner. If you see this i just wanted to let you know I appreciate the effort of keeping real music alive. No artist ever made me shed a tear except for 2 people. You and Dmx. I just wanted to say thank you for your creativity. It impacts us as fans and listeners more than you’ll ever know and see. I also hope to meet you one day. Keep up the amazing work.
Addiction is real
who is this song supposed to be to i’m getting a strange vibe
Damn life's what you only make it.We all have demons we fight. Let's help the world with this song.lucas jelly y'all keep on using yall voice's people humans listen to y'all messages gods gift my number one track this year stay
Yo this is put together really well . Grammy ??
Addiction took the chance of a mom from me it took away the chance of a dad . It took my sister and my little brother away from me ….ive lost everything at the hands of addiction. Now I have 5 children with a man I almost lost to addiction, I made a promise to my 8 year old self it would never be me , and I’ve succeeded . I’m proud of myself because I won’t do to my kids what was done to me . They will ALWAYS have me .
I love this song. There’s just so much meaning behind it for everyone whatever it may be take it how you do. ❤
Love Jelly Roll's voice.
from a simple guy from SA -- Joyner is good.... respect (2024)
13k push ups good luck Sir
If you ever come across this Brandon just know i miss you dawg
damn man... This hit me in ways i cant even explain..
Loves these two. Who knew them together was this. Wooooowwwwww
It sucks to be on drugs it one of the hardest times in my life
Linc Set😎  you should Linc up with ur mans an help him instead of making a song about him..I**0
https://youtu.be/xxgbxn2NTJk?si=fp0O5jqrFW1gFbIq  I can
Joyner was in top form for this one! And jelly roll did his thing like always.. 🔥
Joyner so real and raw 🔥  Praying for everyone in active addiction including myself 🙏🏻   💔
I lost everyone  and everything and I'm still trying to concur that demon this song gives me hope that oneday I'll be myself again
I got goosebumps on the first 😮
This really hits hard bc i lost a family member from an overdose
🙏
Addiction has a ripple effect; drugs, gambling, pessimistic/victim mindset...all you can do as a friend is support them and love them. It's hard to see friends/family going through it however you can't force the change; it has to be an inner want so deep that it surpasses the conditioned quick fix.
Every time Jelly Roll sings or DAX sings can you get me emotional? They need to do something together for real.
28 YRS CLEAN FROM THE DISEASE OF ADDICTIONS 05/08/2024
Wow, this song made me feel something. It's been awhile
My sister sent me this 😢😢 I hope to god she gets help she deserves the world & more 💓
My brother died wish i would have did more fr its a hard feeling leaving someone behind knowing u have been there before i almost would have died with him if i had the chance #addictsarepeople
Stumbled upon this song and glad the path I traveled to see this video!💚👌🏾...This is stupid dope and just discovered some good artists. Jelly Roll voice is such a kiss on this track & Joyner just pulls out so many emotions with these lyrics.  Down a rabbit I go to discover more of their music.😃
Super cool. An amazing blessing.
When I was 12 my mom was deep into drugs… when I got taken away life was a pain foster family I’m it for the money and treat the kid like a servant. This hit home but since I gave myself to the lord he’s been showing me it’s okay to be a man and cry
Love the song, but Jelly Roll sounding like Cher is killing me 😂
I can't help but to feel this song on Valentine's Day this year I attempted suicide. I have so much to live for an Colman Lanes music helps me to o get to tomorrow. Thank you Coleman? Bro you saved my life.
My maw has no long died and I have struggled to get a tear out. This is a belter of a song. Love u mum.
DEEP ❤🔥
I wish I could contribute to the songs that you have written and recorded for the world to connect with and well and truly appreciate it is so incredibly inspirational and inspiring me to do so much more with my life after the crazy life I have lived through I.E sex change father running away from home committing crimes and taking drugs a sister losing her arm in a tragic train accident survivor of multiple suicidal events and friends who have died from not surviving the trauma of the world that has taken them away from us all crazy stuff that is happening to so many of us and needs to be addressed and acknowledged in this way and as many other ways as possible to help others to  connect heal escape and most importantly of all survival from the pain and suffering inside so many different situations that we are all experiencing and hiding from behind the smile that nobody else has noticed is not what we are feeling inside
Absolutely beautiful song ❤
Appreciate this one brother powerful song, it's going to change the way addiction is addressed and treated by counselors everywhere.
I lost my dad to his addiction.  Never been the same since.. but I promise God always makes a way
Drugs and alcohol can give you wings to fly and then they take away and destroy your sky.....your life.. .your family.....everything😢😢😢
This reminds me of how my depression hits and how ppl react to it too it’s crazy this song helps me so much you have no idea
I feel in love with someone who is addicted to meth. I had never used until after three years with him, after using for two years I decided to get clean and he didn't want to so I had a hard decision to leave him because it was best for me
amazing song
My husband has been battling addiction for years. This song describes it perfectly 😢
This song is so deep, I wish I heard it a year ago it could have saved me a lot of heartache and pain 😢
This song applies to my sutation I'm in now with my girlfriend, I asked her to listen to this song and it change her for the better,thanks
💔
This is the realest song in 2024 for me, it's speaks and I love how Joyner is showing two opposing POVs #joyner

Man I hope I can get past this, I’m failing in every aspect of life right now because of what I’ve let myself get to. Gods got me and I know his plans for me isn’t where I am now. One day I’ll achieve greatness and the picture I painted myself to be when I was younger.
This track is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dis mike me as well ill do push ups sit ups and mountain climbers
joyner: "PUT THEM DAMN DRUGS DOWN THAT SHIT RUININ YOUR LIFE" the dude tripping and seeing jelly roll come out from the corner and start singing: 1:40
To know his story and where he is now and how his music is  touching others and healing them and i am one of them.
✔️ DONE ✔️   ALWAYS INSPIRATIONAL Dax
Let me explain why I'm currently hating this song. First off, this song reminds me of so many things. Relationships that have ended with friends due to od's, there's the fact that I was kinda able to get out of addiction, at least way more so than all my other old "friends". And now I've become completely addicted to this song listening to it on repeat. And now I hate how much I am getting from this song, even not on an addiction bases, because now I've listened to this enough that the words are starting to touch other areas of my life, things that I've made excuses about. So yes, I hate how much I actually love this song. It's just one of those songs, the subject matter reaches so many, but Joyner imo is good to the point you can use his songs for so many other things other than just the face value of the song.
Joyner is a real one!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
This song is the deepest addiction song i have come i have Come across in a long time. This sh*t hits deep for me on soo many levels including for myself ❤❤
5 years clean here....
🥺🥺🥺am going through much I can't tell no one even my sister
I JUS HAD A ARGUMENT WIT MY KIDS MOM. ABT TUPAC. I FEEL JOYNER IZ BETTER. LIKE THIS IF U FEEL ME
Going through cold turkey methadone withdrawals now. This song hits hard.
Anyone who loves an addict knows how it feels and this song is how it feels. Saddest thing growing up is losing everyone i love to addiction 💔

I was a herion addict for 13 years anyone whl goin thru it u CAN DO IT AND DONT READ THIS AND SAY YEAH RIGH!T U CAN I DID ! ASK GOD TO FORGIVE U AND GET U THRU IT U GOT TO BELIVE GOD BLESS U🫂💯🙌🙏📿
I FKN HATE DRUGS, TOMORROW WILL BE 7 YRS. ANYONE CAN DO IT, YOU NEED TO START BY LOVING YOURSELF MORE.
Thanks  needed to hear this 🙏
Deep ....On many levels....✌🏾
This was real... Heartfelt.......And good music.

"Done" too the real men who make sacrifices everyday and women stay strong for these men God Bless you all.
Thank you for putting how so many of us on both sides feel into words. You are the best brother some of us have never know
The song just makes sense to me
Relax my sister 10 years ago
Everybody at the bar gettin’ tipsy 😵‍💫
My daughters mother died a year and 6 months ago. This song really speaks to some of us. If only she was alive man
How come you're only there for me when I'm trying to get clean? Youhave to see both sides
3 months sober off meth man this song hits a home run for me every time never thought i could do it buh here i am now sober and fighting this fkn demon
Man I'm in it. I gotta loved one losin the fight. I jus wanna help but ya Can't help those who don't want to Change. Feel hopeless
Joyner and jelly roll did they thing on this 🔥🔥🔥
I will do -1 push-up for every like I get 🤷‍♂️
#JellyRoll
I have a friend that is also my tattoo artist.  He is on drugs & won't get help.  No one will let me help him because there afraid that he is going to lose his kids.   I really want to help him 😭
Fuuuuuuuuuuck!! 😭😭😭😭
I just went to the hospital. And they admitted me. I got a moderate amount of blood clots in both my lungs. I hope I can make it. But like I previously said. In these past couple months have been off. Like something has been following me. And waiting for something. God. I'm sorry. And I love you. Wish I could've followed your teaching. But I wasn't strong enough. I want everyone to go to heaven. To see the miracles of Jesus. And all the great blessings. Please forgive me everyone
To all that’s still trapped in the grips you can win you can break free this kind of cliche but it’s true WE DO RECOVER!!! Joyner this here is a real one bro!! So so so many can relate to this and the said part so many will come to relate to this! It’s hard trying to help and you see that person go right back and sometimes it’s a repeating cycle but speaking as that person we need that love, we don’t understand a lot of the times when we active out here that everyone who loves us is going through it with us we feel it just us!! It’s tough for the ones on the outside looking in on this madness but don’t stop loving them and trying because that one try might be the one that brings you love one back and save their life!! We do recover
I love it
God bless you all ! Deb & Bob  amen!
I always learn about Joyner songs existing when I need them most. My birthday is tomorrow. But so is my 7 years clean    ❤ God bless everyone, and it's hard at first but slowly the years start going faster then you're like me. Sitting here feeling old cause you can say the last time you touched drugs was 7 years ago. ❤
Every time joyner go this deep I can't help but to let the tears fall this guy different
Got goosebumps bruh
Love it from someone who had addiction struggles for 19 years. I am sober 3 years now.
I've been clean 10 years in June and this still really touched me!
Does anyone else see this dude's HAIRY ass shoulders? 3:12
I really needed to hear this today
Seriously one of the best songs ever! ❤
My wife and I are both ex addicts and will pray for each and everyone out there with the same struggles as we have faced. But luckily we had each other through the tuffest times of our lives.
I've been struggling with an addiction and it's costed me and my family thousands and more than just money. I'm only just recently recovering and putting my foot down. I've controlled a lot more of my life recently, and I'm very proud of how far I've come. I used to be an alcoholic and a 2 pack a day smoker. If I was awake, I was drinking.. Now I don't do either, and it's been so tough getting here. But whenever I want to give up, I remember that I wanted to give up yesterday. 1 year ago. 10 years ago.   Fall down 7 times   Get back up 8 times  We all can overcome, there's always a way.  You don't need to do it alone. There are others that want to help. This song really helped me remember to keep going. Helped me remember that I have come far. That I've made progress.   I cried a very good cry today, haha. Thank you
I graduated high school at 17, went into the military, all I did was go to the gym on base. I worked my ass off, I became the perfect soldier, I enlisted in E.S.T (Emergency Service Team) the equivalent of S.W.A.T... I participated in every opportunity to learn something new, sometimes I was chosen. I was only 18. Then I was introduced to cigarettes and alcohol... A year later I was discharged for substance abuse. I have never lost the guilt I feel from those days of walking through those buildings turning in my uniforms, handing over my military badge. I'm 36 now, this song brings up so much pain but offers a lot of clarity. I'm not dead. There's still time for me to improve, and for anyone with a goal in mind. Never forget why you started, never forget the people who are rooting for you.
I was always the person people wanted nothing to do with... I was the person that never was picked up for a game I wasn't ever the addictive personality type or the kind of person that could simply lose themselves in a unfamiliar situation with no light to spare    but people always leave correct I wasn't ever in in a state of existence perhaps most would not deem ideal shit kinda of was the only option when people didn't want me I couldn't help but find myself not lost not hopeless not even afraid   but I found myself in a place that I ought to have known for Jesus  had a way of going to find those who might not be the typical person his father would consider on the path but in the dust an in the dirt he who was lost I went and I found not seamlessly endless pits of substances or lust that words can help you to catch a case but it illuminated me from within sight set High seeking a pleasant place to in time perhaps find inclusion acceptance unity family love honor patience and joy   and I would soon find I had a shit ton of all that and more than I took strength from God who knows where but I took it I took it all smile hand shake hi five held a door for a stranger helped a lady in a hotel take her last night's dinner in a cardboard box to the trash because she was disabled and couldn't not get it all herself in one trip    a Dove that has been from plenty of places in witch I would be lucky to even deamn a way to divulge one's time life in travel butt to the local fags of Orlando Florida I have been forced to take each day alone but a afraid anymore but God forgive me for saying it but ever alone is a normal thing to anything but oc it's pertaining to yours truly the southern stan of the human man it's been a years experience with the way freedom  let it ring let it sing to clouds in 885 Crystal Bay Lane Orlando  albino niggger lives there in his details death and birth Michael Brown Chaflan  7563 Charlin Pkwy, Orlando, FL 32822
3years of being able to make it another day 🙌 addiction was my destiny, but now it was just a part of my journey 🙏
God help me this song speaks to me. I feel this !!

How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  Yeah, I got somebody I love (yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (whoa) But I wrote this song in hopes when they'll hear it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it as much (whoa) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and makin' you feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (do what you might, whoa) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (lose it) And you in denial about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me  How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  Look, I know you been callin' for me (yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names,  but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (uh) How do I let go of something I know is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay
Yea addiction has killed everyone on my fathers side here where I am from I am the only Winegardner left.
I only smoke weed and suffer from severe ptsd and bipolar and I feel this shit I hope everybody here gets thru that field of pain there’s and end to this maze u all strong I promise ❤❤
This is pretty great. The bass thumps.
I heard this song for the first time yesterday on the road coming back from my nieces graduation from pre k and I just lost my twin to something similar and I just cried cause man I miss him I can’t
🔥
Saw this live and bawled my eyes out, lost too many 😭
That second verse changed the whooooooooole tone of the song
Joyner is the best storyteller🐐
My heart hurts after listening to this 🥺
As someone who has seen both sides of addiction this song really hits home. I was a heroin addict and a convicted double felon. Somehow, i found my way 6 years ago and have maintained sobriety. Love & support brought me this far. I have two brothers who were gripped by addiction and they are in prison. My youngest brother was on meth n shot himself in the face on NYE and got arrested for a gun charge. He was attempting s*icide. Middle brother went to prison for 30 years when he was 21 for a gun crime and hijacking on meth. He has 25 years left before he can be considered for parole. Drugs will rip a family to pieces 💔 i try to be a part of the solution now but what can i do? I get people into treatment but it's not enough. What is the answer? On top of it all we have a broken justice system. I don't even know, man. It's too much.
I saw the Lord in this song.
They should do a remix with Eminem and Russ
I relate to both sides. So much emotion . It's such a beautiful song❤
The depths and substance makes a great song. Thank you both for another heart-felt banger
10 push up for every like I get on this comment
24 years opiates/heroin addiction>>sobriety date 08/12/2012 🙏 Never EVER lose hope.
Damn this song made me cry.  I'm not who I wanna be either but hell Why should I even try? The things I do ain't best for me, but yeah I like to be high.  There's no excuse for doing it anymore So I wipe my eyes.  Sit my kids down and I let them know That Mama is tired.  It's not their fault and they don't deserve it  Cause they are angles in disguise.  When I look into their eyes.  My whole world comes crashing down and And the pills, they just tell me lies.  Who do I look to in my time of need  Nobody, hell not even God  Too embarrassed to tell him to fix me It's delusional I Need a new start I need a new head I need to leave pills behind.  Forreal
Since nobody posted the lyrics I shall do it !!!   How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know?

Every like on this comment ill do a pushup every comment on this ill do a situp video proof on my channel❤
This hits home Ive been that person trying to fight everyday to get better and climb out the deep, dark hole of addiction. When you’re in it, it feels like you have no light, no sunshine to give you hope but all it takes is finding a way to love yourself again and want better for yourself and not allowing the fear of feeling like shit for awhile for you to make the first step and truly see that little glimpse of light of hope to guide you through! Addiction doesn’t discriminate it doesn’t matter your race, career, financial status, etc it can hit you hard and can be anybody! Prayers for anyone going through it
Tremendo tema 👌🏽💯
4 years clean I miss my dad every day

Judgment and woe

🎵🎶🎶🎵

My girlfriend overdosed on drugs and it broke my heart I always wonder if she’s ok
Esta cancion se siente no se canta
Joyner has been my favorite artist for about 5 years now when I discover him while I was in rehab actually. Music with a true message. Will always be a huge fan. Oh and an I’m now 5 years sober from meth and heroin. Your music has helped me thru so much.
Ever since I got sent this song.. I listen to it all the time. Idk why but it hits
I want to send this to someone but I know it won't change them 😔

On methadone for 20 years....I'm a proud mother of a brilliant 12 year old girl....I struggle every day but I'm lucky for those who never let me go
Real love means you are there no matter what...not to enable but to encourage... and to be there to help stay alive 🙏🙏🙏😢

Wow that really hits home
I spent 10 years addicted to pain pills, heroin, meth, and pretty much whatever I could get my hands on. I lost everything, including my girls. I overdosed twice, and it’s a miracle I’m still alive. I’ve been clean for 3&1/2 years now, got my kids back, and my life. Recovery is possible, I promise.
My wife sent me this video and it hit hard because I’ve been battling this addiction for 19 years on and off. Opiates has ruined my life. But she has been through so much with me and I know if I don’t get it this time she leaving me. I already lost her respect and her attention. I pray the most high gives me the strength to beat this addiction. I already lost 2 brothers and one sister to this disease.
The world needs more of this❤✌️🧠
🙏
I'm still on drugs with a significant other and we are living this song.i pray I get the love for myself and get better.i want a better life for us.😢
Had me ball hit home
At the end. Of the day. Every day. I feel like he days the things about half of us feel. Period
Best song, too real for these folks
Love ❤❤❤❤
Love the video love the concept love the song but I do kind of wish that at 2:13 the actors would switch so it would switch between a mother and a daughter a daughter and a mother a father and a son a son and a father a son and a mother father and a daughter a brother and a sister a sister and a sister a brother and a brother Just switch between multiple people I think that would have been a real dope concept to see.
49 days sober. Just out of recovery. If I didn't love Joyner Lucas already.. this did it for me. I went through recovery with so many kids who probably love him.. they need this song.
I'm  crying 😢 😂❤
I lost my Lil brother to overdose fentanyl 😢
I just care
jelly roll kind of ironic considering he used to move bricks back in the early 2000’s lololol
The way you're able to address sensitive issues in your songs in such an artistic and compassionate way is incredible. I feel the songs so deeply that I get moved to tears ♥️🫶🏽
I’m close to giving in guys 💚🤦
First time I heard This without knowing who it was I thought it was cee lo green on the chorus
Song of the fkn year !!!!
Joyner is really underrated this is🔥🔥🔥
I love y’all too, grateful to have artist sharing love like this and grateful to have people for it to reach far and wide across the imaginary divides.  Thank you.  It may seem like we live in a world of shit sometimes, but our reality is what we focus on and we are blessed to live in a moment of time where things like this are possible.
Clean for months now after oding 3 times from phentanyl after being on drugs for years  bout to get a job and start rebuilding its possible. I was one who thought i was too far gone at one point but I made it back somehow and if I can i know anyone can
I wish my cousin and best friend were around so I could send this to them. Addiction is a b*tch man.
If you don’t believe in yourself then you’ll never believe someone believing in you 😢
Ill mind 6
I can relate to this song so much I lost my best friend few months back to the pain killers I wish I could of done more to of helped him still hard now he was everything to me both went through so much together I love you so much mikey brother rest easy up there ❤️
Cart explains how that just hit me diffrent lost a best friend like a brother too a addiction so feel this one 💯😪😭❤️💙💪
This hit me hard 😢
There is no such thing as a lost cause. 13 years ago I was a homeless dope fiend. Today I'm a wife, mother of 4, and a 4.0 Ivy League student. I didn't receive my high school diploma until I was 35. I believe we all have the potential to get clean, but we're not all going to reach it. However, it can be you. The choice is up to you. The pain of detox is temporary, the pain of using when you no longer want to isn't.
People are afraid to play this type of music 💪 this hits deep in my family
I'm coming off meth for about 5 months clean and I feel like I have made a good strategy with the hardness from a 12 year addiction and get my first rehab program that changes my whole mental and substance abuse. Im going to be a music producer and singer of my struggles of battling and becoming a good man for my own sake anf my kids sake
Joyner is a artist  This man is so underrated  🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
You inspire me❤
Joyner Lucas n FOMENKO DANGEROUS TRK WUD B EPIC!!!!
This song hits home in so many ways.
My son and I. Add drug induced mental illness. He is so talented. My only son. Now a man. #alcoholism #mentalillness #beatmaker #pianist😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Still hurt
Bro tha hardest!! Bless those going through addiction I hope u find in ur heart that someone maybe not everyone but someone loves you! That's all u need to have hope.
Thank You Joyner and Jelly Roll y'all hit me hard on this one.
158 days clean today!! Like all the other recovering addicts here if we can do this so can you. I pray for you every day.. you've got this ❤️
that voice is beautiful @jellyroll
Not me crying wishing my father changes with his addictions😢
I lost my sister and i relationship due to addiction and mental health.....usually when you're a kid you're superhero is batman or superman etc. ....Mine was my sister. I love her so much....Eben though she don't come around I'm staying clean cause that's all she ever wanted.  I LOVE YOU SIS ...
same song idea like, honestav - i‘d rather overdose. love the idea
This was absolutely amazing, sitting here with tears in my eyes, thinking about past pain that haunts me.... #Whoa 😔
Caseoh💀
We literally went to school together but I feel like you forget alot of people as you go up which isn't a bad thing but honestly Joyner half of the people we were around became addicts in some shape or form including me it still hurts me today I'm clean and I've helped alot of people working for AIDS Project for over 8 years even some of our 'friends' I've put into detoxes many times but anyway I could say so much I was a teen mom, went to college and worked at the same time, living in GBV but all I wanted was to give my kids better than me, a small house somewhere away from Worcester but then COVID came and I became so hopeless and lost I stopped talking to everyone literally I even thought about doing YouTube, my 16 year old always trying to get me to do it but idk how to edit and all that I definitely have ideas especially for merch but sometimes that's all it can be, I remember even being committed to DYS and being in there with Maleisha but anyway sry to ramble def made me emotional, you are truly a blessed artist and I'm proud you got away from here. ❤
I have a problem and it makes it so much worse I get treated like a dog. I get beat and wow. I'm your child not your dog. I can't get better while you beat me.
Great song💯💖🤗🗽
Drug addictions are killing our country. May god bless everyone out there strugling against it or has a loved one who is.
GOD HELPED ME WIN!!!    He won't do it for u.  U have to CHOOSE change.
This hurt my soul.
U deserve a Grammy for this 💯 u'll get it I'm the first to suggest that u will
Neva give up on sumbody u luv no matter the addiction or triumph always always remember God Neva gave up on us through all our trials an tribulation he was there
Yo Joyner is a beast!!! I listened to this everyday since I heard this.
I'm going through the hardest and worst time of my life fighting drug addiction right now and this song totally eased a lil part of my soul. GOD BLESS you Lucas!!
Susan martin likes to pick on little kids she xhoppied my daughters fingers off nobody helped her that was my daugher love gina
Call john walsh tell him regina who is gina golindo luevano regina marie luevano my daughter was the most beautiful baby thats what everybody said the same thing happen to all those kids thathappen to john walshs kid at the apodaca house
And at the apodacas house that what happen yeah foi the horse is going to town on angelina
This song hits home hard, I feel like such a loser getting high and not being the man I know I’m supposed to be but it feel like it’s already too late and I’ve already passed the point of no return. Maybe it just means I should leave my family alone and let them live their lives without me because honestly they’re better off without me anyways.
My man dragged me kicking and screaming to get clean after he got clean. I have 7 years clean and we have a beautiful daughter together ❤
Song hits different man
🔥
Probably the best two people to touch on this subject ✊ 💯
Reading some of these comments warms my heart in its deepest spaces . Please keep fighting the good fight, Warrior kings and queens! All my prayers and hopes are for you! You can break free!!!! 💖💖💖
I miss you
Little over a year off tranq the last time. Started my addiction in 2004 with pills we could get from medicine cabinets in the 9th grade mostly oxy and Xanax. In 2010 I got clean for 5 years until 2015, In 2017/18 I tried again but stayed using after breaking my back hip and shoulder in a car accident and obviously not getting any pain medication but eventually I broke. From 2019-2023 I was addicted to heroin fentanyl cocaine hookers benzos, whatever I wanted I had got a settlement from the car accident and dumb luck invested in crypto and was suddenly a millionaire. I remember when I picked out my luxury apartment I had invited a girl from tinder over and was setting up the place didn’t have furniture even in yet. She asked me about why I picked this place if k could live anywhere, and I said “idk it’s hard to pick your coffin, but this feels like as good a place to die as any. “ because in that moment I knew like the way I knew the sun would come up tomorrow that one night in this apartment when no one is there but me I’d end up doing to much Xanax fentanyl and heroin, and I’d OD before I could get any coke or mdma or whatever to get my CNS from shutting down. And somehow I was so far away from love, from god, from hope, from anything that as a 29 year old millionaire, who’s smart, good at most things, had been a good person, even in my addicted I didn’t lie cheat steal rip rob and scam to make it happen I paid my dealers extra I treated them with respect (I didn’t have friends) and I told my parents the truth I was a junkie / I didn’t want to have to always lie to them. - but here I was realizing I’ve probably got a year to live maybe 2… and the only thing I could think was, damn I wonder how yk make sure someone finds my dog. The next day I took an Uber home to drop my dog off with my parents because I was more worried that my dog would be alone without food when I inevitably killed myself, than I was about actually dying myself.   Turns out everytime I overdosed it just so happened someone was there to find me and get emts.  In 2023 I had lost and spent all the money, including losing my cold wallet keys, and spending about 300 a day on drugs everyday. Usually a brick or two of dope, for 150-300, once a week 500 pills from dark web$2000 another 2 grams of blow every day or two $120-200, and some Xanax, adderal, Valium, whatever I could get in large quantities and looked like fun. Call it another 500-600 a week on random pills. And when ur doing 4-6k worth of drugs a week u can’t cook or clean or take care of urself, sooo, Uber eats 2-4 times a day, Ubers to get anywhere, on demand housekeeping service once a week, vacations and shopping cus I was broke my whole life - escorts and dating apps, another 1-2k per day.   And now I can’t afford to buy groceries, I’m half a month late with rent, I’m engaged and own no property have no credit and my job sucks, but I’m clean: and I’m alive: and thank you everyone who got me here. Kim and my family most of all
drugs changed my life , but only for the better !   if there was no weed in my life i would be in jail for sure . so i will never forget how i was and how i am and how i am suppossed to be
I hope my kid’s mother can listen to this and think about how she is destroying everyone and we need her to stop
I sent this song to my sister who said it made her cry that's how much your music reaches people including myself... i did 5 years in San Quintin state prison cause of the choice I've made during 20 years of an on and off addiction with herion... I currently have 6 months clean, i live in a clean and sober house... proudly working a full-time job that i love💪🏼.. And none of it would have been possible without God and the love and support  of my family🙏🏼🙌🏼
This one 🙏🏾
My favorite song for the night
Got one more fan…
Real shit. I love the song. And hate it too. But listened 400 times in a row. And cried on the floor. Sobbing. Whaling. Being dealing with someone I love much. Going thru these issues. Both verses were so good. But the addicts verse is what made me cry. These videos Joyner does are incredible. “Perspective rap.”
Damn this shit hits home for me ❤
Alcohol. My demon :(
Joyner climbing that mountain with ease
Becausebof thus song im two weeks sober after 14 years of smoking
Would love to hear Joyner Lucas drop something over the everyday hustle instrumental
God I Thank you for becoming recovering addicted. I pray for the ones that don’t want change but I chose life. I Praise God every morning and every night . He is my strength to continue to fight this fight.
Once again this is an absolutely fantastic epic song thanks so much Joyner and Jelly Roll love you man to both of you...l would do anything literally anything to go see/hear you guys *LIVE* ii would die literally to hear you guys live to see you omg im getting goosebumps each time ii play this masterpiece over and over..❤❤❤❤🍀☘️💚💚💚 #hugeirishfanjellyroll 🥰🥰
It's an illness and its not what we want but what the body wants if that makes sense..im clean now with 6 years but its still hard especially when one is going through hard stuff in their lives. Jelly Roll you are my HERO and your voice in this song is so amazing..this is the best song I've heard in a long time..thanks guys love you..sending warm positive healing vibes,  blessings and prayers for ya'll and to everyone suffering from addiction..God bless and protect and help you all..hugs from Ireland ☘️🍀💚🤍🧡✨️✨️✨️❤️❤️❤️🕯🕯🕯🙏🙏🙏
Omg Joyner and Jelly Roll ii can't stop listening to this song its  an absolute masterpiece and relates to me . Addiction is not any of us want what people don't realise that that addiction is actually an illness iillness.i
🥹 God this song hits home hard
I saw Joyner last night at the Fillmore theatre in Philly. I love his work but was not familiar with this album. I drove home listening to the entire album after the show. I cried like a baby after hearing songs like this and "Broski". WOW! I forgot how powerful music can be. I miss Pac, I miss X... Thanks Joyner for reminding me how powerful music is.
I've never heard something that relates to my life so completely. I can barely listen to this without sobbing like a child. Thank you
i know this is meant to help others but don’t forget to keep your own mental up bro❤
It's not easy all you can do is try to be there.
That song make cry
This song truly hits on a new level. Please keep inspiring ❤
Two of my favorite artists I’ve had the opportunity to meet one leaving a liquor store in Worcester and the other at the palladium in Worcester and the bar next door unfortunately I know the struggle of addiction
This song saves lives.
It's funny I cross this song
Joyner the best out there!🙏🏽
Today is 386 days since I last used, longest I’ve ever been sober since the age of 11!! It was a rough 20years, I could sit here and write a book on how broken I was, how I didn’t care to live life any more but I won’t!! If you are struggling just no the other side is so much better and it’s not easy but it’s so worth it! Just reach out to someone or myself if you want help 🙏🏼
Hands down this song hits home for soooo many people!!! This was definitely a great collaboration 🎙️🔥 this song took me so far back to emotions from my first husband that I thought I had buried 😢
2 days ago was the 3 year anniversary of my mom passing. She had such a heart of gold man but life tore her up and I lost her to a fentanyl overdose. I fuckin miss her so much everyday. She’s the reason I know everything there is to lawn care and why I have my own business. I work so fuckin hard everyday hoping to make her proud but damnit I wish I would’ve tried harder to sober her up. Fuck man. She got so bad off I couldn’t be around anymore but I should’ve stuck around to help her
Please i want transfer the words to Arabia 🥺❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay? Yeah, I got somebody I love (yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (whoa) But I wrote this song in hopes when they'll hear it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it as much (whoa) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and makin' you feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (do what you might, whoa) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (lose it) And you in denial about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay? Look, I know you been callin' for me (yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (uh) How do I let go of something I know is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?'
Oh my Sugar Love. I can't believe youre gone. It's been 8 horrible days. Everything in me wishes I could just go with you.  I tried to save you. I tried so hard to be what you needed. I pray Heaven brings you the  oeace you never found on Earth. I'll always love you... your GA 🍑
🇰🇪🇰🇪This is the best preach like best word ever said  It just took my way of living im getting out to I'll be the next
Joyner is GREAT
18 months in recovery! This song is so deep I love it!!
7 years of drug use , two OD's. Ive been clean from meth and heroin for a almost 8 years. We DO recover. Love each of you. It will get better.
lol
WOW this one hit me hard this morning!! I got clean 4 years ago!! It can happen, I am proof!! And this song is Absolutely AMAZING!! THANK YOU
To my man, you make me proud every day. You fight your demons daily. You fight every day to be on the right path. You have grown so much in the years we've been together. You are an inspiration. Locked in for life 💚💚💚
🕊️
I always spoke my mind. It killed my friendships. I couldnt stand the drugs my best friends got consumed by and i distanced myself. Everytime i rode the high road and all its gotten me is people ive never see again. I miss you bernie patrick devan hunter harley mason ill see you boys again in heaven
Man this one hard! 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Man this album is refreshing to hear and this feature is crazy
When you’re clean and sober , these types of songs hit your whole soul and make you feel every single thing.
I feel like everyone who’s addicted is that scared little kid who just wants to feel okay. 2024 is the year we stop letting people go to drugs. Reach out to your friends and family, help people build support systems and beat addiction
This song is truth. Drugs are evil and kill. They hate. Fight for life no matter the fallout! Love hard.
Been abusing for more than 15 years. Today marks day 76 days, quit cold Turkey on my bday
WOW this shit just broke ME and brought me to tears
Probably best song for the year!
God why let us suffer like this ? End is here
😢😢😢
Smh my best friend died of drugs , she was a amazing person she always cared about everyone, 😢😢😢 still hard  for me to let go 💔
Beautiful song I think we all have a friend that is struggling with addiction. Addiction Kills get the help.
Damn I didn't expect this. Joyner and Jelly making a banger. This spoke to my soul. ❤
I've lost two siblings to addiction. One passed this past August a few days after our dad's birthday.....the other is in n out of jail for the same stuff. Both have went through multiple recovery routes 15 years of help. When do you just decide it's enough pain n let go?
My brother in Law passed away from addiction 1 day before this song was released. He was the sweetest and kindest man I’ve ever met. My sister I found her and it’s an amazing story but he was there and this song means the world to me .  This song hits every heart string! We were gonna see jelly roll together. RIP Brother ❤️
Jelly please rap again 🙏 we need you! ❤
Jelly Roll's vocals are beautiful. 😊
Clean off heroin and opiates for 2 years🙌🏽
Jelly roll nailed it
June 5th will be 8 years since a needle pierced my skin. We do recover.
Being someone who has attempted my own life I hope this reaches people on both sides of the field. Stay safe stay blessed 🕊️🙏🏾🕊️, thank you Joyner
This song hits home was am addict for 25 years d now clean 8 years😊
Get write sh,,fire
It's Hard But it's something you have to do if you really love yourself
Great song!
Great job Joyner!
F man where was this song last year when I needed it 😭 if I would have just let him go, I'd still have both of my kids and just be living my life probably looking for love again but caught up on him too scared to let my heart fall for real again and just be doing my grind... I couldn't let him go and he's got 10 months clean now, we have our son and things are really good but it's just .. WHY COULDN'T I LET HIM GO AND DO WHAT'S BEST FOR ME?! 💔
August I'll have 2 years clean ! 🎉
This is deep on many levels,not all addictions are a drug..I love someone who's addiction is sex..So for this song hits different but it hits nonetheless

Holy shit...... well done brotha, got both sides of it....
My old man drinks like leaving las vegas
Deep song! Love Joyner Lucas, his music is always so relatable! And Jelly Roll is  amazing, my kids (2&5) ask to listen to him daily. Two of the best musicians of our time. Please do more music together. ❤

This is the old joyner i fell in love with. I almost feel this could be a prequel to 'im sorry'
Damn bro Joyner is a legit storyteller like Pac and Em! That shit goes hard and hits hard in the old chest.
I lost my son to addiction to those of you who can still reach out to a loved one struggling with addiction PLEASE DONT GIVE UP ON THEM R.I.P MYLES GARY #Forever24😔🙏🙏

I wish this song was here when I lost my dad my mom all addicted to something 😢 I wish I could’ve saved them
Is the on the ground suppose to be his dad or something 🤔 just curious
🎉
Wow!!! Very real & true!!! Great video!!!
As a recovering addict an a mother of two young babies I see this and just ugh ya may god give everyone that out an may then ones we have lost along the way rest well
Love ❤❤❤you Joyner
I’m so tired of these relapses this song just makes me hate addiction even more!! My daughter needs me shit what am I doing my mom my sister my nephews shit damn god I’m tired
This hurt me so much to watch knowing that my cousin passed away close to 8 years ago from a heroin OD. We were so close and I loved him so much that I still cry when I think of him today. I am 37 and he would have been 38 this past February. I stayed so distant from him bec I was trying to raise a family and didn't want my kids to see what he was doing to himself. Then one day he was gone and I never got to say goodbye.  I would have loved to make it to your show in Raleigh but I'll be out of town with family. Thank you sharing this song and your music fam.
I walked away... it fucking hurts. I'm spending my 23 birthday alone today. I worry so much, it's hard to keep my own sobriety when I'm worried about him.
You just helped me
I’m here for anyone struggling mentally❤️
❤
I lost my bestfriend 1/3/24 to and over dose and it's been hard to let go because it was random out of the blue I watched addiction kill my friend an I couldn't save him i couldn't help him fight. LONG LIVE CGB u will be miss my brother
Will do 1 pushup for every  Dollar  donated to a charity.  With songs name as donation name.
Think how different the things could be. If we had the love and support of those around us particularly from the ones we love. Understanding. It's not about them. It's about us. What if it was ok to offer and accept help instead of hell  from those around us ❤
I love you so much
I appreciate you Joyner, and jelly roll. Y'all won't see this. But you will never know what yall have done for me
Fair play to the actor for learning to hate verse
I dont now anyone with addiction but this opened my eyes they dont need judgement they need so much more
💥💥💥💥
in the first 2 weeks you only had 15k views, now your well over 10 million views <3 and im here for it
2months clean forever to go
My son has been addict for 18 years. I cried like a baby hearing this song. Thank you for shedding light in this problem. I have lost many family and friends, because I refuse to give up on him. After 18 years he is clean. Love your music never have I been to put into words the pain you feel watching someone you love go through addiction. It can only be worse for the one going through. Thank you for making them human.
Aww dude snaped I felt his ass
This song touched my soul. We need more of this in the world. This is a story of my life
Shhesssh I feel like the white dude wrote that second verse fr the way he performed it … this Lucas need a Grammy fr
I have a gambling addiction can you make a song about that
❤ touched me brother
I was a meth addict for 7 years. I tried to quit on my own for 3 years. I couldn't do it, until i realized that my wife was pregnant with our first child and knowing and seeing what it's like being addicted to drugs with children in your care, i cried out to God to help me. I didn't have a church background, grew up Buddhism and was an athiest in high school. But that day it was supernatural. I cried out tears running down my face and prayed for him to help me that i didn't want to do this anymore. The next morning i woke up with no come down, no withdraws, no crash no craving. I instantly had no desires of the drugs and have been 8 years clean. All because of Jesus. Praise God!!! I hope this message encourages you too seek a relationship with Jesus and put your faith in him and turn away from your sins. Drugs are spritual and demons are attached to them that is why we crave the addiction. I pray whoever reads this message that you are touched by the overwhelming love of God's pressence right now and that drugs no longer have dominion over you in Jesus name!!
Facebook
I need help. Send me a sign or something or anything
Me talking to pictures of my younger self 😔
Bravo🎉....Glory to God
Damn this hits.........I suffer from depression an I could relate to this song it different ways.......I know if I was gone no one would miss me...
everyone talking about addiction and ignoring jelly rolls addiction. Bro looks so uncomfortable. Ive been clean for  7 years and all I see is the addiction they are ignoring. Im also a bigger dude but thats next level.
loving an addict is the most painful thing
I want a remix w/ Jelly doing the last verse.
thank you for this, i needed this
Love you voice ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing song, such insight on addiction… made me tear up. Keep grinding Joyner you are saving new school rap
Cool,the guy who lays on the floor wearing a Rammstein-Shirt😅😄👍🏼
Addiction is a disease full stop.
Hits different when this is your song to your father
I never thought I would hear a song that actually talks about whats going on in my life right now with me and my fiance 😞 I just wish she could hear this and understand that this is how I feel and she's not alone 😢
😔😔🔥🔥
How he hasn't had a heart attack by now is beyond me
I lost my uncle to drugs and I'm pretty sure I'm going to lose another one and I'm only 13 and I'm going through depression and jelly roll has helped me a lot
I heard  this on the radio
Fuckin Fire 🔥 Joyner now that wtf I’m talkin’ bout brother
This song helped save my sister. Thank you jellyroll and Joyner!!! God is amazing!!!
I got nothin but respect for someone who can battle addiction and turn there life around and be the person they were created to be  👏 👏💯💯💯

Hits hard when you've literally lost homies to drugs. Love and light to everyone trying to leave this life behind.
This is like me arguing with myself in my head

Good.song it touches me addiction is.real and I can relate I'm a.recovering addict fuck you fentanyl your killing our people
Start some.push ups
Addiction is a disease.. in fact it's the only one that will tell you u don't have a disease. That's the insanity they talk about in the big book. Surround yourself with sober people who keep you accountable
I just came across this song and damn!! This was me getting sober
How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay? Yeah, I got somebody I love (yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (whoa) But I wrote this song in hopes when they'll hear it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it as much (whoa) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and makin' you feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (do what you might, whoa) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (lose it) And you in denial about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me  How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay? Look, I know you been callin' for me (yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (uh) How do I let go of something I know is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe?

Its crazy that this is the first song I've heard from Joyner 🔥
Joyner you are absolutely brilliant broh!
When you can finally afford to get Christmas gifts for your kids 🫶🏽 the little things , like when your family trusts you enough to babysit now and want to be around you again .
Powerful 🙏🏽
This song is so real. I felt every part of this masterpiece.  Speaking about the life.
“I know we ain’t talked in a while but fuck it I really don’t care what it was”❤
I can't believe that this music video is going to hit 10M views very soon, it's shows how much of a impact this song is having 🔥🔥💯 My favorite song on the album
Wow. Great song. I pray for the lost and the struggling.
Good bro will always support

How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay? Yeah, I got somebody I love (yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (whoa) But I wrote this song in hopes when they'll hear it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it as much (whoa) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and makin' you feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (do what you might, whoa) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (lose it) And you in denial about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay? Look, I know you been callin' for me (yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (uh) How do I let go of something I know is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?

Sick to see jellyroll moving up in the world

Wishing one day my mother finds recovery and stays in the path. She has 2 grandkids one she's never met because she, like my whole life puts drugs before anyone. Including her own health
Miss my baby brother everyday
So glad Jelly Roll is finally getting the recognition he deserves.
wow felt
This song hits my heart on so many levels.. lost 2 of my cousins and a homie to drugs.. and alcohol.. and i went down the same path.. as they did.. its hard to admit you have a problem.. especially if you dont want help..but in all of the numbness there is someone trying to help.. but its like bieng inside a car on a stormy day and someone is trying to get inside.. but all you can do is watch them.. and not let them in.. my best advice.. let you love you.. forgive yourself.. and let someone who cares in..
Saying addition is a dezise .an yr useing that as an excuse to use.IT. ❤
This hit me so hard.
Shit hit hard hope everyone overcomes there addictions there is a better life if I can make it out trust me everyone can
Insane❤
People tend to forget that addicts who don't have a proper support system usually have no reason to live. I understand how hard it is for family but please don't ever give up on them. My whole family has given up on me. I truly don't care anymore. Why bother when no one cares? I'd love to be "normal" but between the addiction and the bipolar and no one that truly cares and wouldn't even notice if I was gone why bother? The only way my family would notice is eventually when I stopped using my cell phone they might get suspicious.
i really wanna see joyners reaction after hearing that hook from jelly roll fr ts too hard
Lord please deliver my bf from this addiction and free him to his potential this hot deep 😢
I swear this song helped me take myself to rehab…
Landon
Check out Jamwayne ❤
This is so POWERFUL 🥺😭
👑🙏❤️
60 days cleàn. Love this song and video! God bless everyone struggling. May you find the help you need.  If i can do it, anyone can!!!!!
This shit brings me to tears nearly every time I hear it for all different reasons. I love this record but I fuckin hate this record
dam this song hits so hard. Im trying so hard to keep my brother around. But his addiction is out of control. We can’t leave him alone in our home cause he’ll pawn anything he gets his hands on.   He’s my big bro, it’s so hard to see him suffer like this.
Joyner so dope
My brother just sent me this song and I’m in tears this is so heart felt thank you💯🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️
I’m only 35 days clean of a four year addiction to fentanyl was 106 lbs when I got locked up did 20 days now I’m 140lbs clean and serene going to meetings spending time with my kids. This song saved me from fuckin up on day 21-35!! Federal facts💯❤️💪🏿
Wowowowowowowow I’m speechless
This song is so powerful, my husband played it for me yesterday and I've had it on repeat pretty much since. The 1st verse was me to my ex in my 20s, then my family to me in my 30s, until i began to face the demons in addiction. To realize those demons were roots of pain and trauma from a young age. Then I started speaking up alot more like verse 2 and nobody liked it at 1st. So my husband and I, took our daughter with us and moved away from everyone. We were on our own journey walking in faith, overcoming a past that haunted and crippled us too long. We got clean by letting go of the fight that was too big for us and dealing with the things we could change, our attitude, as we walked through the process of healing, God has began restoring everything. But that's taken a complete different way of thinking and boundaries with family and friends. Who are now beginning to respect us. One of the biggest thought change, was to recognize the  self sabotaging thought patterns and replace them with the rest of my life is the best of my life and shit like that. Well not shit, because it's now beautiful things. I'm 44 now so it's not too late as long as your breathing
Best video and songs i always put it on replay 🎉🎉❤
Music is powerfull 😢 #pain is real 😢
“Nobody wakes up addicted. Every great fall is from 100 bad decisions”. KB New Portrait.
Fuck man. This one hit
My best friend is suffering from addiction this song hits gome
This shit hurts man 🖤
I’ll be seeing Joyner this Saturday with Dax..!! ❤ Can’t fkn wait!!
I’m sorry to hate on the meaning of this song, but jelly roll should of used this chorus for another song! He builds me up in the beginning only to hear some wack rapping after.
I’m on day four without hydros. I almost slipped up today. I swear to God this song came on thank you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. This sound like a conversation that I had with my wife just let me do what I wanna do but she wants better for me and I want better for myself so I’m standing
Been off pills for a year now and this shit hits deep
nah i didn’t expect this to make me start crying.
This song legitimately makes me bawl my eyes out...I guess I'm not done healing...It sucks when the drugs are their 1 true love...not their children,  not their family,  not their friends...
I will NOT do a push up for every like this gets😂
I listen to this so many times and I cry every time I listen my son messed my life up and now I’m working with youth on addiction issues this song is my everyday go to to stop some of my pain thanks to my nephew Mace who has been standing with me 😢.
Some how you and Jelly always put out the music I need to hear and this time you did it together. Thank you and love to you both.
I love you Trevor Chase Owen if you see this I'm your Dad and I love you with all my heart 😢
This is the best song I have ever heard ever ever on my son....
It doesn't matter what it is cheating drugs, drinking or whatever it may be no one is perfect but we all 🤔 we are so sad I love you Daphne I never wanted this to happen to us please God bring us back together in God's name I pray 🙏 Amen..  please forgive us.. we belong together 😢
this song hits me hard but instead of addiction it's mental health that's the issue.... it also got harder and harder after each verse
❤
I’d love to see a JR and mass of men collaborating
Every 11 minutes
I shared 10 years and 5 beautiful children with someone who I just couldn’t save. No matter how much I begged and pleaded. He’s better with God. No matter how much I loved him and needed him here with me I know he’s better where he’s at. I’m finally at an acceptance level in my life but it hurts to know he can’t be here.Rest in love forever Kenley Prince you will forever be missed and loved❤️10/18/1986-07/05/2023
Sad but True. You will never believe in others that are trying to bring you up until you believe in yourself 😢❤
Man! You are an amazing song writer that one hit close for me.. your energy and delivery of these verses had me stuck in the story.. only a few have the skill set, level of talent and ability that you have and own!! You bad bro,!!
Getting a award for this 1
Sober 15 years fam.
Gina Caruso I love you
Much love from my dark place!
@yashuop I’ll do a push up for every like this comment gets but max is 5000
Damn felt this shit deep in my core 💯💯😭
How can we fall apart on things we’ll never know ?!
I promise I love you but I gotta do what’s best for me !
This song its home i lost people to addiction i actually lost my uncle a month ago and i had  a problem my self but i beat it and bettered my life because i was losing everyone around me from my family band kid i been clean a few years now and till this day it still bothers me 🫡🫡🫡 to everyone that is battling addiction its hard but you can do it
I used to be a hardcore addict but even 2 years of being clean the first time I heard this it gave me chills. Everything he speaks is straight truth. From an addicts pov, this song hit different and really makes you appreciate the strength that God gives you to fight addiction. For all the former addicts that’s reading this there is HOPE! Never give up, pick yourself up and dust yourself off, this road isn’t easy but I can say it gets easier with time and dedication to better yourself for not only yourself but for your future family. Gods got you!! ❤
To the people suffering from addiction hope you recover am praying for you ❤
I wis could call from here...
mfs sleepin on Joyner
I love this f****** song so much bro
Greatest song ever made!!
This was uplifting I was happy to see Rittz come in at the end. The flow had my family smiling he loved it.
Wow 😢
I can relate to this song ❤❤❤
Great song only thing I hated about it is the line about "people callin it a disease" meaning addiction isn't a disease, it 100% is and has been proven to be. I'm sober 13 years at this point and still understand I have a disease I will never be free from but work everyday to make sure it doesn't take control of my life again. I hope more what he meant was that people use it as an excuse but it shouldn't take away from the seriousness of it.
This is so strong❤❤❤
This is one person talking to himself. Trying to change themselves for the better. Both sides of their story of the same person.
This is so powerful, Christ changes things.... fixes people. Our hope isn't in each other but Christ alone.
I wish my Mom could have heard this song! R.I.P. Momma!
By the grace of God in the year of 2011 I believed on the Lord Jesus Christ for the Forgiveness of sins and the Redemption of my Eternal Soul it is by the power of his death burial and resurrection that I was saved from eternal hell In 2013 on the stoop outside my friends apt 3:00 in the morning while smoking a cigarette because I was so messed up on Suboxone and antipsychotics that I couldn't sleep thinking in my mind why does this cigarette and these drugs have such control over me Then a still small voice of God spoke to me and that loving voice asked me a very important question Am I not powerful enough to deliver you from the bondage of your addiction? And I began to think to myself Surely God Is right he was powerful enough to save my soul from Hell surely he can save me from this addiction At that moment I changed my mind about everything I had formerly believed about the drugs and I decided that I was never going to touch them or look at them again it was a commitment that I made to God because of what he did for me on the cross and God delivered me from the bondage of addiction he took away my urge to use drugs and it's because of him that I am sitting here in my right mind able to type these words  Those of you reading this not only do you need to be saved from hell once and for all by grace through faith in Jesus  if you are not already but you need to trust God to deliver you from the addiction and he will  The battle is in your mind but if you seek God he will teach you how to change all that Proverbs 16:3 KJV  BELIEVE ON THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND THOU SHALT BE SAVED❤
@joynerlucasofficial this is your element bro aside from eating rappers lol
I lost someone on Easter of 2022, to a Fentanyl overdose, I loved and continue to love him, I had ti walk away while he was still her fir the safety of our daughter and that was one of the hardest things ever. And to loose him at such a young age.    05/05/88-04/17/22
You can do it one day at a time ! 12 years clean ! ❤❤❤❤❤ surrender to life you can win we gey so used to losing we feel its the only option but God didnt design us to hate ourselves . Love Joyner Lucas he the best rapper

I don’t mind the heartfelt, introspective Joyner but I wanna see him spaz.
My father is in active addiction, 15 years to the day. He’s had a stroke, brain aneurysm and now he’s paralyzed from the right side of his body but continues to use.  this song makes me cry every time

Jus heard this on the radio, and this is litty like a titty
I got you Jelly Roll Joyner beats on the Way! i got your email
Up until 3 years ago I realized that staying in toxic relationships can be an addiction too. You get addicted to the pain, the turmoil, the stress, the potential of what could be, the good times...all of it.
I'll do 1000 push-ups for every like I dont get
Prayers going up to all
Womp Womp to all the people in the comments get over it💀
I love you Mum

Xq a nadie le gusta la buena música
My dad was a crack head. I been addicted to weed and everything in between since I was 11. I ruined my life because my dad ruined our lives. I thought I took the right path to forget shit but truth is Im from literally the worst city in America, back in the day.   Kissimmee, FL.  I found guns, stole guns, sold drugs, did drugs. 13 I played cops n robbers with my best friend with real guns. Him and I both been stabbed and stabbed people. Real shit. No cap, they say. 3 dead best friends and only 1 left.  life put me through the mother fuckin ringer and Im just trying to beat this bitch with a waffle ball bat!
Thank you!!!! Needed this song more than ever! ❤
Joyner once again the best storyteller
I love someone who struggles with addiction
Im 2 weeks sober. Wish me luck ❤
Increíble tema me hizo llorar 2 cantantes espectaculares congratulations WoW beutifull the BEST song
67 days clean. This hits
Me ready to leave after loving a addict for 9 years. I'm loosing the fight that I can never win. Something I'll never understand.  All I can do is pray on it as I know I'm beyond exhausted and depleted. This song speaks to my soul.  💜💚
instant classic
You can lead a horse too water but cant make it drink
I'm balling my eyes out, I've been looking for a reason to keep breathing, and this just hits damn near all the soft spots that make me wanna quit, but I need to hear every word it just.. Sucks.
Drugs damaged my mental health now i’m gonna be on medication for the rest of my life for those who’s wondering i have schizophrenia but the good thing that i have learned the lesson and now I’m clean since 7 years
Everything Joyner touched is a masterpiece 🤌🏽🤌🏽🤌🏽
Yo joyner... I lost my big brother and 2 of my closest friends to addiction man... I had a kid and got myself out of it g... and this shits real... I cried listening to this man... I pray anyone reading this finds hope and wins their battle with addiction and/or mental health... whatever struggle your facing that makes you feel its not worth it man... your all worth it... stay blessed... you got this shit
To my ex who chose to lie rather then be truthful now I know the truth u never loved me or u wouldn’t lie sometimes we go through life thinking we need something to make us happy be happy with who u are no one is perfect god loves u the way u are! Show him u love yourself quit the things that tell u different god has your back as I do to!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm from North Shore Mass. I was working in Bowling Green KY and saw Jelly and Lil Whyte during the flood in Nashville in like 2009-10ish . Benn rockin with Jelly since he rapped. And obviously been bumping Joyner since he's from Mass. Funny this is a crazy colab years later.
How lucus turned the story is class
I cannot even explain how moving not only this song is, but the comments left by real people dealing with real issues of addiction...and the moves made to correct and help themselves, and their families. Love and light to everyone reading this. From myself and TrainWreck Kenny 🎶
Man this shit is amazing plzz make another that is touching
I dont think its a disease i think its demons
If someone been on heroin do you ever get em back???
Yoh Joyner is good yoh

I lost 3 friends to this addiction and still wish I could’ve helped more 😓
Think you saved my ass bro..💯
It's like another I'm Sorry, but a different, serious subject. Love hya Joyner. Hope you're well
Been a fan since day 1 man, these type of songs are the reason I listen. I love and admire how you tell both sides of the story. Absolute lyrical genius! I’m glad you’re getting the recognition you deserve.
that is how I feel a long time ago 17 must 18 years now I am doing good with everything
One off the most beautifull message, for help stop 🛑 drug or someone addict to alcohol 🥃… when we lose someone It’s not for a segond It’s forever 🥹🥹

ppa
Thank you ❤❤❤❤
I am 5 years clean and still fighting other addictions... I still have a few demons to fight. But this song means so much to so many people. I woke up one day feel exactly like with several years. I am sober now. Bless the people who have  supported me. I wake up happier, my life isn't picture perfect, but nothing like the nightmare I was living.  Recovery is possible buts its hard. Life is more enjoyable.  It won't be like that everyday, but I hope I can remain in recovery no matter what hard things come my way. Great job on this song.
Joyner deserve more Credit... Industry they don't know nothing about Music, They love Mídia like Drake... bro I am your Big fan keep that Away  I don't use drugs but the message of the song touched me, many lives lost in this world of drugs... Good message for the world Joyner and I like to you And Chris Brown Again Goo due... God bless you
Ok video it live
Growing up, my stepsister was addicted to drugs and I didn't understand. I was so mad at her. Coming home from vacation to find every tv in the house missing, my parents trying over and over again to get her clean. I hated her for what she was doing to us. I joined the Army, I went off to make my own life. I thoight I was so much better than her. *Then God humbled me greatly.*  We are all one step away from losing ourselves. I didnt understand back then. Now I do.   The human body is such a difficult place for every soul to reside. The answer is God-- seeking Christ. I know now that this is so much deeper than just this world. This is a spirtual sickness sweeping our land, our whole earth. If you hear me, please, pray for me, and read your bible. If I leave nothing else behind when it's my time to go, I hope I leave a testimony to the Truth.
Love you all when things get rough just know.. you all matter love your self an others find peace an love
Shit hit me so hard I just parked my car and started crying. My brother dealing with an alcohol addiction right now and I’m watching that shit take a toll on him mentally and physically. I hope he gets better and anyone else dealing with an addiction 💙🤞🏾
Rip 🙏 to the ones I've lost along the way we will see eachother again 💔
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Hi cousin
Man I cannot lie I’ve been sober going in three months but every body still looks at me the same and I have no clue what to do I really need a sober support or someone to talk to it’s hard
This song deep 💯
Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 1: Joyner Lucas] Yeah, I got somebody I love (Yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (Damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (Yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (Woah) But I wrotе this song in hopes when they'll hеar it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it enough (Woah) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (Damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and you makin' feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (Do what you might, woah) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (Tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (Lose it) And you wan' deny all about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me  Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 2: Joyner Lucas] Look, I know you been callin' for me (Yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long, I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (Uh) How do I look go of something I know is something is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (Nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, I'm tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me  Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?

I lost my mother when I was 15 to heroin and fentanyl and not much music makes me cry but this really hit home I’m 24 now and it’s still so hard to cope with everyone I’ve lost to drugs and almost losing my own life to them. It is possible to get through it. 🫶🏼
Thank you for the help. I appreciate 🙏  you

{her husband} thank you #joynerlucas & #jellyroll for music wit a meaning #jellyroll u kill the chorus & extra proud of what you doing, fell in love wit you before sobriety sucks album, that ten min freestyle & we NEED that THERAPEUTIC  MUSIC
Second verse I can relate
@theyh8shayeee
Wish I could send this to my lil brother but he died from a drug overdose at 19 years old two years ago wish I could of saved him 😢
I love in the comments I’m hearing so many people are getting sober keep it up y’all don’t give up! I recently lost my mom to addiction and its hard not having her here anymore. I had to separate my self from her as a kid because she couldn’t stay straight and now I wish I could be with her talk to her hug her anything. I have so much regret for the time I stayed away.
Praying for you Joyner❤
My second son (24 years old) is addicted to fentanyl. This song is breaking me....
I'm nearly 24 and am trying so hard to break the cycle of addiction in my family, I fell off the wagon myself pretty badly with alcohol from 18 to just before my 23rd birthday, my mother found me alone and plastered and the only thing that made me wake up and realize what I was doing was seeing my mother plead for her daughters life. I've been sober for 7 months now and trying to keep not only myself but my mother afloat. We both see both sides of this.
“Isn’t it funny, you change your ways, for someone to fill in your empty space” FUCK that line hits HARD!!
I don't think I can win against my demons.  Idk if this is my last message.  But genuinely kind to the people important to you.  They can change your life make you feel better about yourself.   Don't hide your feelings for your loved ones.   I hope i can make it to the end of one piece before my time comes.
😢😢😢😢😢😢
I don’t talk to my mom barley anymore all I want is for her to get clean😢
I love how you always be showing both sides of things.
I wish I could send this to my older brother Tito 😖😭
Lost my aunt who was my best friend to addiction last month and this song touched my heart and broke it all at the same time, to anyone out there battling addiction please remember you are loved
My sister died from addiction. This story hits home for me 😢
Wow ❤ hits the heart on some many different levels from addiction to seeing loved ones suffering. Thank you JR this is so impactful and you say things I never did ❤ much love!!  I'm speechless...this story telling is so real, I can feel the pain between these 2 men and im crying but people need to see and hear this, so many times things that should be talked about and said...are not! Goosebumps 😊 all over everytime I hear this.
I’ve been dealing with this for many years now, my best friend since we were 2 and 3 is an addict and I’ve tried everything… I’ve helped him get clean from fentanyl but he just went to different drugs and it literally kill’s me cause you can’t help someone who doesn’t want help
I lost to many 😢 this song is deep
Man this hits hard with me for sister youngest child’s mom and best friend nuts how things change so fast and it’s so hard to get to them but an addict isn’t easy to reason with! They only get clean when they want too!
As a diehard KISS fan. Love all music. Especially intelligent hip hop like the artists Em brings. Wonder about the shirt. Lol
Love this song❤ 20+ years clean after 3 attempts ✅✅ its possible 🙏🏼 dont lose hope✨
I just lost my brother to addiction, please reach out to them,
I spent 2 years popping pills trying to stay numb. 5 years sober in 2 weeks. I still want to but the kids got me staying clean
Masterpiece
@JoynerLucasofficial I just want to say all your music is great you are a storyteller and that’s what hip hop needs right now positive music about real life not about fang banging or money we need this I salute you for continuing making this music I’m def a ADHD SOLDIER 👍🏻👍🏻💪🏼💪🏼🤟🏻🤟🏻and will continue to be
Music to feed your soul 🔥🔥🔥
As someone who was raised in a broken home and used to experience the addiction of others, I pray for all who go through it, and it may be hard, but there is a way u just gotta push through
Man this hit deep because I was the one addicted and it was hard to get out. The pain I caused to the ones I love. Now I’m 6 years clean and sober. One day at a time. Thank you for your music
🙏
This hit so close to home man
I’m glad you’re getting clean sis
The chills I got man

I have lost sooo many to Drug Addiction Thank you for this song 💋💯💋💯💋💯
This song hits different when your dad is an addict
lost my brother to addiction. His bday is tomorrow, this song hit's sooooo deep
this song hits hard if you ever cared about some one who is addicted most of us have but never give up the fight you are loved and you are needed never forget that
Absolutely beautiful.
Dad,  If your scrolling through these comments and happen to come across mine because I know you listen to jelly roll all the time. I just want you to know I love you. I wish you would just talk to me regardless of how much I’ve went through growing up with you being addicted and having to deal with so much I always tried to be there for you even if you didn’t handle things in the best ways. I just wish you would take that into consideration when I took care of all three of your sons, my brothers at 21 years old. I didn’t handle giving up custody of them in the best way that I could have. Regardless I need you whether you know it or not. I just wish once you could forgive me for this one time and understand it was too much for me to take on at such a young age. I tried telling you so many times but every time you just got upset and it would lead to a huge argument. I couldn’t bear the stress anymore. Regardless of the situation you’re still my father. Just a hey I’m okay would be enough. I don’t want to hear through the great-vine that you are gone or oh your dad overdosed the other day but you know him they brought him back. One day that might not be the case and that scares me so much. So please for all the times through my life I’ve still fought and talked with you and been there. Do the same for me for the one time I’ve let you down.  Love, your Pearl girl
That's Hard!!!!
To all those who are sober, I’m proud of you. To those who are trying, I believe in you. To those who aren’t trying, I hope you can let go, I want to believe in you❤️
What a beautiful voice 😩 @jelly roll
This. Just this.........
I really needed this. Thank you.
My girl had a addiction  She is 2 months clean  I’m so proud of her.
Damn this song hits me so hard in the feels 😢 Joyner you are amazing!
🙏🙏🙏
No words 😢😢😢
2 years clean, I’m so grateful for my life today.
This shit deep i lost my brother to drug addiction at the age of 24 . Fast forward in 39 and been struggling for 15 year's its so hard i work and i function. I have 2 beautiful children . Its so hard i miss my brother 😢 😪.

My favorite rapper right now
You're a light Joyner my brother. God bless. Beautiful art man. Love it! All the way from South Africa. Your Stan! Peace.
Rest in peace Bro 🧡🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾😇
RIP 2022, this song hits close man thanks!
touched body, soul, and spirit. Thanks man. I pray I become what I ought to be but whichever way it goes up or down I'm thankful for the hand that was dealt to me cuz by it I can say that I've reached the highest highs and lowest lows so up or down now don't matter to me which way it goes anymore. The world knows how to destroy us in all the ways we're composed of, but I still pray for it to change and I remain hopeful that it will one day. Thanks for that little gain of empowerment tho!
I overdosed 4 days ago I died... luckily I'm here because if 2doses of narcan this hits home, love the ones u say u love ❤😢 my names austin atkins
18 years as an alcoholic. Almost lost my life, my kids, and my wife. Next Thursday is 10 months sober. One day at a time. One moment at a time.
Hurts cause my dads a alcoholic and he got better for awhile and finally started showing up for me as he has never been there for me and he just gave up on being sober after 2 years and I’m just fed up hoping he’ll get better
Right in the feels.... gonna do my best to not relapse
This song hits so close to home. My ex and I were addicts together but I got clean and he kept using. He is no longer with us now😢... it's NEVER too late to reach out for help or ask for help. You'd be surprised how many people really have your back and support you... R.I.P. Wally.. it's been 3 yrs now and I miss you just as much. Rest easy love ❤
Lost my brother to this battle. He’s still alive but never the same
I’ve just found out my best friend has been drinking himself to death for months.  This hits deep man.  We try and try to get him help and there is nothing we can do.   I sent this to him
This was good made me tear up alot to do with my life
I love music with real meaning ❤
young Yoel Romero lookin ass. fire song too

1 loss is too many. Help is out there. You don't have to go through this alone. Reach out. GET THE HELP!
Deep🥹❤️
Bro y’all killed it with this one. Joyner and jelly duo is… there’s no words to describe it.
I like how the little addiction help line deal pops up right as I’m hittin the bowl..  lol.  Like. Naw..  it aint an addiction, its a slow numb way to finally get out of this pos place and be done with all the bullshit..  all the pain every fukn day, all the worries, stress, regrets..  just be done with it all cuz it all is just a losing game, both inevitable and sad..  when the cards dealt leave you playing uno alone nothing really means anything after..  for who, or what..?  Me? Lol.. the fuk I’m gonna do with anything when its all just a pause / slo mo replay youve already seen a hundred times..?  Ive had my fun, seen what there is to see, ate, smoked, felt what this life has to offer..  ive loved, lost.  Only thing i havent done is children but I’m no father.  Never will be.  Too old to try now anyway.  Ready to either see what goes on after all this or take the infinite step into nothingness for eternity..  maybe ill get to see everyone who left me again.. maybe i’ll start over..  maybe not..,  maybe ill burn or find a halo.  Maybe not..
Today is a new day. Make it count 🙏🏼❤️💯
Beautiful song.
This song brings so many memories and emotions to the surface.
Rip my aunt Tammy 🫶🏻 4/29/24
Yo this shit hit home hard body thanx bro ❤ 💯🫡
you guy

How can you love me and learn to let me go
I feel like Jelly is sooo out of place here 😅
I have to leave a comment, this song helps me so much, leaves me speechless.  the lyrics says it all.   " IS IT REALLY LOVE, IF YOU HAVE TO ASK IF THEY'LL STAY." 💔🖤❤
Bigmon Joyner Lucas always got the good energy
I just let my older brother hear thIs he broke down crying I want to thank you jellyroll and Joyner Lucas this song touches the soul
Bro, yall tapped in on this one. I fill the same way for someone right now. But I aint gona say any names at all . Keep Grinding 💯
😭
Yo this is the realest song I have ever heard. Me and my family to a T.. You released this song at the right time and for real saved my life. Reminded me my fam is more important.
This One Definitely Slipped Under The Radar!!!
this song emotionally impacts me, im a nursing student who's is 22.  my dad died a year into my program at 21 and I found him... I had to do CPR on my dead father although I knew he was dead. this song helps me understand that although he was addicted to both narcotics and alcohol I still forced myself to love him and I still to this day love him.. I'm upset about what happened due to my knowledge and me telling him what could happen but at the same time I understand. I don't want to let him go but he was gone before I could help. thank you everyone and NF for understanding and becoming my inspiration..
❤❤❤🙏
This song put me Hella in my feels this coming November 20 will be nine years clean of heroin for me and I lost one of my best friends to heroin a few years ago. Addiction is hard as hell to get out of but it can be done if you need help, please reach out to someone, there are tons of resources use them
Man I'm going through a break up I really loved  this girl but that's not the point  this song helps.
Thank You Joyner🙏

I’ve been on both sides of this story and I just want everyone to know that you can get through it, you’re important ❤️
Beautifully done! ❤
As a person who has serval family members and good life long friends addicted to drugs , this song hits deep . Joyner explains both sides so we’ll , mannn we gotta be here for our people addicted . Pushing them away by judging and thinking we’re better is only gonna make them fall deeper into addiction. 💯 this song is a eye opener 🙏🏽
Only few will understand the deeper message here. It’s not just about drugs.
Haven’t had a song raise the hair on my arm in a while this hits home 💯🫤
that 💋tee!!! adaptation tolerance let's come together Americans! We The People! this country needs to Get 🫧 Clean y'all!
Man looking at you grown I listen to your first song. Now to this man proud of you
Not only drugs but gambling addiction has destroyed many of us, hope we will overcome it though 😊
Rip brother. I fucking miss you.
amen thx you God for not giving up on me 😊
Found my brother dead 6 days ago. Relapsed for 3 days myself, but stopped before i was back in the life. So many dead friends and family. Fuck fetty
I lost my brother last year due to drugs. We stopped talking , I wish I wasn’t cold hearted during that time. I miss him and I wish I can tell him that I miss him.
This song hits hard. I had people I know and love/d, who lost their life or loss everything because of addiction. It’s the hardest thing to watch when you have tried your best to get them to stop. God Bless all those who are dealing with addiction or know someone who is struggling to stay clean🕊️💔🙏🏾😩💜
Great song. In the world today we need to be more patient with friends and family struggling with addiction. There is a lot of things/people who don’t want others to succeed and stay sober. God bless all who are struggling.
I did a whole year doing meth bc I wanted my pain to go away and I’m 21 I about lost my family and my husband realized I needed to change my life
thank you
I felt this song I love it
Depression is real a thing. To those who are going through it, please get the proper help  you need .
Thank you i needed to hears.i lost my lil brtha 4years ago to overdose
My husband has been in and out of treatment. He just completed 30 days yesterday. I’m praying this time he stays clean. We have a 25 year old and three year old together. He’s my soulmate and this song is so relatable.
My mom is now 3 or 4 years sober after 2 hard years.. she finally just got off her probation period and got her nursing license back! I’m so proud of her and how far she has come!
DEEP!!! 😢🙏🏾
Feel like Chris brown would’ve ate this chorus alive but Jelly did pretty good
Life story man 🎖
Everyday is a battle…..yesterday I lost but the days to come I have  to win for not only me but my family
To every comment that is telling us your story. We are all proud of you and praying that y'all don't relapse. May God be by your side on your journey
Recovery is possible!!!  I'll have 17 years on 08/01/24 - #ODAAT  🙏💚🙌
Man I seen my brother a few days ago, man must have lost over 80 pounds, missing teeth. He’s unrecognizable. It hurts my heart to see him this way. He still can’t even bring himself to admit what he’s doing to me. Instead he just gets mad and tells me not to come back to the city to see him. I want to help, how can I help when he won’t even name the monster he’s fighting.
🙏🙏🙏 fQr EVERYQNE fighting a BATTLE in SECRET while SILENT
Amazing
This song touch my soul been a while since I've heard music🎵🎼
My brothers sister dad uncles cousins this is all of them even me at one point ive lost so many and been completely on my own since i was 14 my mother died in the may 22 2011 joplin ef 5 tornado and my dad did horrible stuff to us as we grew up put drugs in our bottles padlocked us while my mom was at work did horrible stuff to us he went to prison when i was 9 never saw him again my mom died when i just tur3d 14 i was on herion pills alchol everytging i could get my hands on i got my ged went to hvac school and still with my wife feom when i was 14 3 kids almost 30 but i say never give up always think god and keep trying when its bad
i was majorly addicted to pills in high school and into my young adult years they almost took me multiple times been through 3 stomach pumps and 4 OD's before 20 years old  today im almsot 3 years sober and never been prouder of myself for it. this song hit the soul. anyone can make it out with enough help and love
I've dealt with addiction and now sober since Aug 17th 2021. My little brother is going thur this disease for over 13 years. I've tried every even though he's continued to burn myself and our mom I pray everyday that he grows and beats this addiction. Love this and thank you for this beautiful song!❤
This song is a BANGER. not only the music, but the words. This duo is amazing. These two artists are incredible by their own accord, but when they come together, it is mystical.
Sometimes the best thing you can do for people you love is let them go the harder you love the more they’ll fall
I pray that the person reading this message beats addiction. You are worthy and don’t give up, come back and tell me your success story
❤
this is beautiful
I wish my brother was still here i would send this to him he have been gone for 6 year now he passed away from fentanyl
🔥🔥🔥🙏✊️
Is thar really him singing or is that autotune
I have an addiction to corn 😢
I'm 131 days sober today. I thank God for being patient with me and not taking away all I love during that time I was down.
Why can’t I stay clean 😢😢😢
I had this in my life   i thought she would never give it up no matter how much u love them it start with them
Been using since I was 12. Lost too many friends to count. About to turn 37 in 19 days. 3 years sober. Spent 16 years in prison. This song hit me on both sides. Thank you Joyner. If Racism doesn’t get you a Grammy this should should.
After spending 17 years on meth and losing everything I had, my family my friends my home and cars. I was finally able to get myself clean through the grace of god and my recovery program. Just got my 9 year chip on April 11th this year. Unfortunately my long time girlfriend and mother of my son continues to struggle. She was supposed to turn herself in to jail today but decided to run instead. Praying she can make the right decision before she ends up dead or serving a long prison sentence. This song made me cry because it truly relates to my current situation.
I am addicted to it ❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😋❤️💕🥰
It is awesome ❤❤❤🥰I lo
This 🥀 my soul felt it.  💜
Jelly roll gave me chills with that verse
Crying wolf is one analogy that I never thought would apply to my life in such a crucial way. I got the the right help and the right opportunity at the wrong time. It is difficult waking up every day ( thankfully) knowing that the next 24 hours I have to live as the addict version of myself in order to keep a roof over my head. I know your thinking that sounds remedial and you should know it feels like so, but I will say this … I have seen the winning side of this battle field, and that is how I know winning the war is beyond possible and I also know that I am not meant to fail or die from this BEHAVIOR that I have unfortunately instilled within my brain. Everybody in my life that means the most to me besides a couple exceptions have given up and not because they don’t care or love me but because they cannot put themselves through seeing me destroy my life and my self.  I want nothing more than to be me again, a father, a brother, a friend, a son, a genius, a stud, an example and a human. I just don’t know where to turn or who to ask, seeing as how I have been through this and let so many down before, here I am crying wolf.
Dude in the video dropped them oxys in the sink with no water to wash them down the drain. You know he gunna go right back and pick them up and eat them right after the music video is over. Come now.  Nobody does that lol 😅😂
Pain....Oh the pain. Pops overdosed when I was 12. My little brother Overdosed in 2015. Both left this planet and left us..... If my brother didn't die I would have never had my son. My friend passed around the same time his sister and I became close.... my son was born. Gods timing. I had to lose the only one I loved for my son to be born. Watching him now while listening to this song. Be kind to each other we are all in this together. I quit drinking and getting high 10-4-2020. Im a chef.... I make $20 an hour plus tips and I made 170k this year Trading Bitcoin. There is light.... don't give up. It might feel hard now but it will get better. Get sober and create a life. I love you all.
Joyner has always that pill that helps one get out of addiction or suicidal thoughts or depression . Let’s pray for Joyner.   Thanks Joyner Lucas.   Like if you agree🙏🕊️😔
I love it so much. It’s such a good song.
I an 14 and i feel you  me dad is clean after 20 years of drugs and my mom is locked up from useing drugs
Thank you for making this song. It hits home.
😢 Cvv. 😢
How does Joyner get folks to do his raps so perfectly?
7 years sober. This one hit me in the feels 😭
Is he talking bout em..mabe
I'm not addicted but I'm depressed and that to is a disease and it still feels like you mind is on drugs just the ones that make life harder and harder the more you don't address it
Goosebumps every time I hear this
I’m not a big fan of Joyner Lucas but god damn bro it’s incredible
3 months sober. Relapse after relapse. Mistake after mistake. Im sorry for the hurt I've caused. I still hate myself for somethings I'll never be able to take back. I just hope God forgives me
ol Jelly Roll doesnt look like a Jelly Roll
I hope Joyner gets his friend back 😢
What a powerful song! I’m sober almost 5 years but the love of my life just can’t get it. We had built such a beautiful life together then he relapsed and lost it all. It’s such a powerless feeling to see the person you love transform into a complete stranger in front of you. I had to cut him off but still let him know he’s loved and I’ll be here if and when he gets clean. Addiction is the most painful disease in this world and I pray for everyone suffering as a result of it 😢🙏🏻
This song  reminds me of my cousin, had to cut him off recently and it's been really shitty for the family.
5 years clean off heroin , making 6 figures and have a wife and 4 kids. If you’re reading this you too can turn your life around. I ODed driving my last shot. God kept me here ❤
My sister is struggling with this exact problem... This song tho...
Keep going my G you gotta another 1 wit this Story telling u matche🔥
I never left any comment for no artist but Joyner Lucas man you in my top 3 of the best artist i have listen don’t change keep going my dude . “ peace and love form reunion island keep pushing u will change the game “
This hits hard been an ex addict

Dad and mom addicted for 15 years clean for 7 and a half years clean our son and daughter clean and sober we rock recovery every day and screw the 4 percent ❤ recovery families are the strongest ❤trauma is the gateway
Addiction is a disease
0:50 Me and hubby are almost 5yrs clean but witness to many deaths including our granddaughters dad and uncle who overdosed from drugs and family members also our 3 month old step grandson babysitter killed him with feddy I'm proud of everyone who made it through and didn't die and sorry for the people who didn't 😢
The fact that u speaking from both sides is art bro!!! And thank u frfr
Bless.... addiction affects so much more than the one stuck in the cycle....
Cocaine is the worst and alcohol stay blessed yall
This song sure hit hard. Lost my big bro and miss him everyday. He would have been obsessed with your words and how you express these emotions through music. Can’t wait to see you. Much love ❤🌹
I'm lost everyone I love behind  .my drug problem 😥
I'm battling addiction I'm  going threw the withdraws right now.getting clean  and only thing that helps me is music and y'all got my heart on this one. JellyRoll and joyner Lucas thank you for your heart felt music. Love y'all man keep y'all heads up stick together.Have each other's back .
My Son had me listen to this song. It is so powerful. You see I lost my son to addiction.  Never did I ever imagine that I would bury my Son. I have 1 Child left he too is an addict to fentanyl. I'm so scared of getting that knock on my door again to tell me that I lost my only child left, to Fentynol. He is the one that had me listen to this song. I love it!
[Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 1: Joyner Lucas] Yeah, I got somebody I love (Yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (Damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (Yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (Woah) But I wrotе this song in hopes when they'll hеar it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it enough (Woah) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (Damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and you makin' feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (Do what you might, woah) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (Tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (Lose it) And you wan' deny all about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me  Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 2: Joyner Lucas] Look, I know you been callin' for me (Yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long, I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (Uh) How do I look go of something I know is something is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (Nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, I'm tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me
Real AF ! In many ways.
No one knows the love it takes to let go
This song hits so close to home no one knows my pain in my family which are my kids and grandbabies they love me but I never had a real mother she was addicted to but clueless as to what is going on in her own home ! I was 7 shouldn’t have to say no more terrible childhood I had!!! This song touches me so thanks @JoynerLucasofficial
Nice song 🥹
Depth and weight, this message will touch so many
I hope and pray my sister see this she been fighting addiction for years and hope one-day she will stop.
This song is deep
💔💔💔💔💔
Gangsta shit man....this shit hit home...real love dont die man.....
Love for all who feel both sides❤
Joyner and jelly two artist in my top 5 Joyner being number one coming together to make a song like this is so relatable I recently lost my brother this year to a fentanyl overdose and i this video sucks because it’s so spot on
OmG ThankYou 4 this 1
I'm 6 years clean from pain pills an Fet and opanas. It was the hardest fight I ever fought. It's real people can say it's in your mind only but it's not you get very sick when you don't have any sweating throwing up body aches fever. Feels like you have the flu x10. An all that's running through your mind is I wanna get something I don't wanna feel like this ill do anything to not feel like this. Pretty soon you don't even get a high anymore you just do it so your not sick and can function through the day. This shit is real if you have a friend or a family member addicted to pills or fet or herion help them don't bash them it's hard yall. Im one of the lucky ones that made it out the streets. I'm my mother's only living son my brother wasn't as fortunate as me. The police took his life. That's why I got addicted
FAHQ.. This song hits hard especially as someone that’s been on both sides of the equation.
Day 1 the time is now wish me luck my bros
I will really try to stop using if I get thousands of likes on this comment..until then..  I'm Lit
"Whats Best for me " really.. that's not love , that's why they use drugs cause "loved ones" don't care.  So when u say u must dead them as they are on drugs,, think they care, already been left them  homie
Joyner Lucas hates White People
Lord has really given Jelly a very special and amazing gift.
This is exactly my situation right now. I needed to hear this. Thank you.
Yea ! That’s a hit yo . ♠️21.🫡
I'm 13 years off hard drugs ❤ With Jesus and music
AN EXCUSE 💯
This hit hard! Reading the comments even got me with that lump in the throat feeling smh! Ive bèen secretly dealing with an addiction to klonopin for going on 12 yrs now, came home from an 11 yr prison bid n thought i had the world by the balls, always knew i dealt with some form of depression but it just never hit me until after all that time its crazy but my dad was shot n killed in kensington when i was 2 months old, then my mother who also dealt with her own issues n addiction didnt answer her phone al day so i went to check on her n found her with a cord aroundd her neck at 14, within the next few months i was confused n angry n sht happend n i got bounced around to almost every juvenile placement in PA, even caught new charges in a few smh, then 18 straight to county then state and maxed out! 2012 i thought the fight was over, never tlkd about my parents tho as i felt like as a man we are suppose to keep our heads up chest out n keep playing the hand God hand dealt, i felt id be looked at as weak idk! But a few weeks being home i was going to get a haircut n got to front door n everything turned black, heart pounding etc, Hospital said idt was anxiety n gave me xanax, all i knew was it made me feel like finally i feel better then Dr's kept me on n would even seem mad if i asked them whats the end game or can they taper me, i never told anybody though, all i have is an aunt outta state n a 76 yr old grandmother n we dnt really speak so time went on, working paying bills then slowly but surely i got to the point of waking up n staring at electrical cords similar to the one my mom used wishing i had the ball's but theres also apart of me that absolutely refuses to give up on myself and i honestly dnt know why! Never played the poor me card ever either but ive also allowed ppl around me bc i saw them hurting n needing help n would be there everytime n now that ive hit this point, everybody took my kindness for weakness n thats cool whatever maybe i was helping bc i always wished someone was there to just give me a hand, not a handout just a hand to guide me in the right direction! Now ive lost my job, most likely end up homeless n if thats God's plan im ok with it! I pray nobody ever feels this pain we all probably similarly feel bc addiction is addiction regardless! Sorry this is long, but im just at the point where idc who thinks what bc no matter what, were all human n nobody is perfect im just so tired of this lifestyle n medication n the fkd up part, ive never overtaken or made myself run out ever ive stayed at 2mg its just the length of time on n seeing someone die in my cell from a benzo withdrawal/seizure to stories i read online, I am just scared its just no getting out of this hole but seeing ppl talk about getting clean n living better lives again gives me some bit of hope! Addictions may be different but we are still feeling trapped in the same cycle so thats why ive never judged anybody bc i saw that hurt n pain i was only masking to cover up my own issues in those same ppl! I pray everybody finds that peace they are searching for n never give up bc i know for a fact, even for me, there is light at the end and we'll be free wishing we opened up alot sooner!🙏🏻
2 greats... beautiful song and collaboration
Stay strong Joey. Seeing you today with your head down got me in tears If you see this please reach out to me, your not only my friend your my daughter's favorite uncle. I'll do whatever it takes to help you get better. We where both cursed with addiction but I know how strong and caring you are and what a great father and brother you really are. Never think you are less than perfect because you have been cursed with this horrible disease.... I love you buddy. Hope you see this and remember how great of a person you really are.
Having your family ripped apart by someone you trust and watching the kids suffer and wonder what they did wrong will always weigh heavy on me. It's a disease, and it's always your loved ones that hurt the most. Stay strong and keep fighting. If not for yourself do it for the kids and the people that look up to you. Never give up!
I wish this was out before I lost my best friend Matty😢 maybe I wouldn't have lost him to addiction a few years ago. He was the one who introduced me to jellyroll. He probably would've took his ass right to rehab 😭 love u both
🔥
This song 😢
Fighting demons in a hard place not having no one to really talk to and express what you feeling in side them closed door it don’t reveal what pain is but I just thank people like you that inspire others to finding light 💡 when all they see is darkness 💯
Thank you for making music that helps and we can relate with
My mom died from a Fentanyl overdose.   Please get clean.
Me and jellyroll look almost identical I think we could be related 😂
This song makes me feel sick. That's not a criticism.
5 months clean off IV fentanyl use baby!!! Every day and counting ❤
Thank you joyner lucas this sounds helped me kick dope.
If you get goosebumps and flash back in your life likeee

One of the best songs I've ever heard 16 months clean right here
i miss my mom and pops fr
Wow I pray for all who under addiction ..as humans we need to pickup love one another more
Nice
My mom was an addict my whole life. She got cleaned but relapsed 2 years ago and is completely lost, homeless & gone. I tried so many times to help her get clean but she's too stubborn and toxic and it won't and never happen.   I love you Jelly your music really helps me during my most hardest times ❤
great song 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Its been 13 years since I lied to my ex saying I cheated because I was dealing with mental illness and didn’t want him worrying or stressed over me. I just reached out and got blocked. Should I keep trying yes or no. I see both of us are single too.
Thank you Joyner for addressing this on going life 🙏 experiences for those who continue to struggle or know someone. The struggle is real too this day impacting on our younger generation.
Grammy Award ... Coming !! ~ 💿 (Don't Trust the Streetz - 🍚)
I lost my dad 24.12.2023 This hurts me deep

This song hits so fkn deep I pray for anyone struggling if it’s addictions depression whatever your problem is know theirs someone who loves you
Heavy
This song so deep ❤❤❤❤ I hope it reaches who it needs tooooo.....
My brother n law is active in addiction I see how it effects my husband I pray he gets clean and for all of yall dealing with a friend or love one in addiction I pray they get clean
My mom and dad are or where had drug addiction,s and thus has helped me thru it i appreciate it 🙏 😢
I been 2 years clean and have 3 awesome kids now and when I was doing drugs for almost 4 year and I was homeless and ruined my family and hurt people and im so happy now that I'm 2 years sober I don't wish that on anyone it kills people I watch friends close to me die
The verses are next level, and jellyrolls voice gives me chills. If this doesnt get a grammy, im running up on the voting committee and slapping the fuck outta sumbody!
Reality check if you gotta ask you already have your answer and it's NO!for the slow people.
11 years clean ❤ty Joyner and jelly for this song nobody really knows what we go through trying to get off this mess love yall keep it up papas
Jelly roll did the hook and killed it!!! I want to see jelly roll finish this song without joiner
I just lost my baby cousin to addiction last night 😭
25 years as a crackhead through and through!!! Now I have got 7 years drug free!!!
i love when rapers talk about real stuff ,it herts but it is beautiful ,painfull but real ,truth that not many wont to hear , its hard but this is what it is fight or fall ,we are so blind , but wish for batter . (if it nonsens dont judge im high right now 😅bur still love the song!!!!
Iv been alone for so long that I'm harder to reach. Dam that's deep and I get it
Prayers up for any and everyone that's going through this
12 years sober 🙏❤️
Been clean almost 10 years. But now I am loosing my husband to addiction.  Its the hardest thing ever.
I've been labeled as a victim cuz my bf of 4 years couldn't fight his demons but could fight me. Then fought the neighbors.. now he's sitting in jail looking at 30 years or more, and NOW he's clean. It's sad. Love doesn't always win
Thus reminds me of the ORIGINAL joyner...love this shit🔥🔥🔥🔥
Welcome back
RIP Joe Cairo. Cant believe it still.
This songs puts the perspective of two different state = ONE is for the loved one ,TWO the Addict ......"How can you love someone and learn to let them go..." this shit hits hard  It hits different when you get to understand the misunderstood 😔😔😔
I'm battling my demons as we speak. My dad passed back in August and I tried to hold it in then I got laid off 2 weeks before my birthday and that was about it I exploded and I couldn't control life or my life anymore, I feel horribly about all of this because it's done damage to my marriage and my health and I just used the last of what I had and I'm going to try my warrior hardest to stay clean I think hope wish and pray that this is it I've been going hard to numb the pain for 4 straight months now and I'm sick of it. The disappointment alone kills me inside. Thank you for this direction I needed. Joyner and Jelly I appreciate and respect your lyrics more than any other now a days. Keep driving keep inspiring keep you! One love!!!
Wow that really hits home for me, I have been clean for seven years and it’s been a long hard journey but he needs you to tell him every day how much his addiction hurts you and just be there for him because my family wasn’t and it still hurts because I was so lost and I know I will never turn my back on my kids no matter what they do! Isn’t it beautiful how a song can have such a huge impact on us, especially when you’re at your lowest point sometimes a song is powerful enough to save your life! God bless you I’m praying for your son’s recovery and I hope this is his turning point to the life he deserves
💪🏿
I just sent this to my baby sister who more like my child bc she was born when my older sister (who has all 4 of her kids,I help her with them as much as possible) but our Mom had her with my stepfather when I had just turned 15yrs old a week 1/2 before she was born and our older sister was 17 going on 18. I never knew that you could cry from happiness because in the hospital I got to her 1st and tears where just pouring down my face bc I absolutely love this baby more then anything in the world.  My late Mom got ill after she was born an I left school to take care of her.I went back an took the g.e.d., scored 4th highest in the nation,  so they had to give me a high school diploma) Long story short my parents and stepparents died from things stemming from addiction 😢 and my other younger sister from my late Father w my stepmother just got clean and sober and hadn't been since her husband committed suicide 💔 on August 25th 2011, so my other niece an nephewbeen thrown around going back an forth to womenthey call Nana, Gramma but not blood bc they dont have any grandparentsbc of our parents and stepparents choices). So, now I am like okay 3 of us our clean n sober, bc my older sister use to drink in here 20's early 30's but she had her child at 36 and she is my niece who now has 4 cousins living with her, which she gave up her Mom for and they love eachother but I know she misses it just being her an her Mom but she wont ever say that to them but she is a kid, jealousy is there!! So, We need the our baby sister to get clean and sober to break this generational curse frfr....So, I just wrote her, n kept erasing shit for like 45min, bc she says what the addict in this song says,like stop preachin to me,can't you just say hi? I do but I have been so worried about her, bc on Easter I saw her for 1st time in almost a year and she is so tiny,she has never gone away??  I am beggin her to please just trust me, trust God,trust the process bc I know the hardest part is getting inside the detox n then rehab but once your there and you start getting healthy and we will be there for her emotional support and get her stuff she needs, pick up her calls,  ect. My 7 nieces and nephews are very scarred about her health problems, and the older ones know it's addiction because my other little sister just got clean. I was a addict  since 8yrs old and I got clean and sober few years ago but the kids were little when I was messed up,do to a home invasion I relapsed in 2014 but I didn't have no kids, and I use to think that Iwasnt hurting noone!!! I know all sides of addiction and the hardest is loving a addict,  I feel horrible for putting my loved ones through hell. Everytime the phone rings my heart starts pounding bc I just know that my heart is bad, from a cardiac arrest and I wouldn't be able to keep it together seeing the kids in that pain we all went through, so I am praying 🙏 that this song will make her say "Come get me, I am ready to go!!" . I ♥️ you K.J.W. if you see this♥️🙏✝️🫶🫂🏃‍♀️ Letsss Goooo please 🙏 ✍️
To all my alcoholics out there. Imagine this is the old you talking to the new  alcoholic in you. My daily convo. Soon I’ll be free
Amazing. The only word to describe this song. I hope this can motivate all addicts to get it together
This song was needed for many! Thank you!
Love, Love,  Love this ❤❤❤❤
Wow
I thank God every day for saving me from myself .
Please pray to jesus for my brother Zachary.  SAVE is soul, please. The power of christ is un matchable for all evil shall flee l.
Shit just made my Soul cry on GOD
For a second, I thought this was caseho
Thanks for being an artist joyner. we need our souls touched.
I love this song.. I hope jelly roll knows how much we love you, and I believe in you ❤️ 💖
After listening to this for the 50th time, I just caught that Hollywood uppercut.. "nobody's perfect, not even jew."
This aint bad but dont go the dax route. Mother of god please dont joyner😢
https://youtu.be/lreGcgv6FwY?si=dO1jQ3wK9BvrgT5f
Drugs ran my life from 14-24 I run my life and have 4 years sober
Thank you guys so much! I needed to hear this today.
“Livin in hell, wonderin’ when i get to leave” i feel it every time bro 😢💯
Addiction kills. Never too late to heal
I can relate
My mother was addicted to a-lot  of things but she went to rehab now she’s 2 years sober change is possible I promise keep looking forward
My son sent me this song after my last overdose. I cried like a baby when I heard this song. I've learned that there is a solution. Ive been clean and sober for a month now. Thank u Jake Duby. Luv always ur mom
The 2nd verse had me tearing up
Joyner be hitting you with that first verse. And then do the other side of the coin on the second verse. He gets it. Only the real will even listen all the way through and realize both sides are relevant. Unity comes this way.
This song though 💪🔥🔥
Check my new song out on my page
@joynerLucasOfficial I love your message but more than that, I love the fact you work harder than nearly anyone else in the game. (shout out to @Russ bc he's on top of his game as well)
i miss my brother thank u for this
My boyfriend and I got clean together 2/3/23 at home with a support group of miracle workers. Not easy but so worth it for everyone who said we could NEVER do it together. My dad was an alcoholic and I was so angry at him until I became an addict myself. He’s clean now bc he’s dead lol but I imagine he’d laugh at me saying that and call me an asshole and be super proud I broke free. Less judgment, more love. People just need help. So grateful to my family who loved me when I didn’t love myself. “Are you afraid to die? No. Then why are you so afraid to live?”
I spent 30 years in addiction. More than half my life. Always thought it’s where I was supposed to be.  Meth is some gross ish .  I got 14 months clean off everything.  I have family & people I literally grew up with from kindergarten still active with addiction.  They don’t want help 😔 wish I knew now back when I was a kid.  I prey for the people that is still suffering from addiction.
This song hit me pretty hard ...I lost it when I seen his def Leppard shirt ...it was my fiances favorite band ...she committed suicide on her birthday 2 days after mine ...I never got to tell her goodbye ..if u have Loved ones with addictions please sit down and talk with them ...let them know they are loved before it's to late 💔💋
Just lost my ex to drugs today this song hits so much harder then before
this hits close to home
Everybody has their own heroin, somehow. Stay safe out there and don't fold, just for today.
My friend just past from overdose! 😭 this shit hurts
My grandson never gave up on his mom, even when he lived with me and we had not heard from my daughter for 14 months. Then she turned up again... and did not get clean, over and over and over again. At almost 45 years old, things changed. We had all given up. Five years later -- she has just gotten her first paid vacation at work and is living in the same apartment for almost 4 years, and is up for a second promotion, and keeps her car payment paid, cooks, and never goes out at night. phew! Miracles do happen. But it can be way, way down the road if they don't die. So live your life and put yourself FIRST -- You can be there for them, but you can't save them.
Im quitting after this, Thanks Joyner
This is powerful Jonah💯
Ive been a junkie for over ten years I don't want no one sympathy. I know I won't live past fifty and it is what it is... We are who we are as people
This is my cousin right here!!! Lets go Mike!!!!
This saved my life, you have no idea♥️
There is not a single person in america who has not been touched by drugs or alcohol. Damn.
Ame4ica is standing up yall. This is planned, the drugs, the invasion, the economy. We have to stand in christ. We need to fight this evil together
If you get lost, everyone loses
I have one brother doing lots of time in jail, possibly prison & the other twin on the streets homeless due to drugs.... plz guys pray for them 🙏🏻 love you all ❤
Every single one of you commenting about your struggles, your addiction and your recovery are all amazing souls and deserve nothing but the best. One of your comments might just be the thing that helps someone save themselves and that’s a really beautiful thing. Keep going guys, you can do this.
Struggling myself and hearing this song has come at the right time
Wow 1st time I heard this song… wow is All I can say!! I thank God everyday for this amazing beautiful life I get to live now, even tho Ik I deserve to be dead. God and songs like this keep me going  3 yrs sober and counting!!❤
He makes me have a great cry 😭😢😢
#HitsHome This song is on another level! Someway Somehow...Someone is having their life changed by this music💯
Thank you for music like this. How you're not considered top ten at worst is beyond me.
RIP Kahn & Fish
Not gonna lie, my older bro and my lil bro played this for me I was so pissed cuz I was about to hit.. heard this song felt like the biggest piece of **** all 3 of us couldn’t stop the tears at that moment.. with that being said I’m 1 week sober and I’ve never felt better I love you Joyner for making music like this 🔥that’s from my heart
Love this
Dude should quit rapping 😂😂😂😂
Joyner & Jelly roll! Sending an important message! Thank you. I hope this helps anyone struggling! Lord knows we all know someone who's lost someone, or many someone's to the drug epidemic 😢
Alcohol drugs p0rn g@mbling is all an addiction i pray for everyone fighting their addiction that they get through it whoever is reading this !! I love you if no one told you today !!!
You can’t tell me this ain’t God music
This hits me so hard. Someone whose very close to me just lost someone very close to them over addiction. Not even a week ago.. I'm sure it wasn't easy making a song like that, but it's necessary. Thank you, guys, for using your voices to speak about such a difficult subject.
Deep message felt this one 💯
Its crazy huh DAMN ..! We don’t know what we have till we loose it all .
🖤🔥🤍
This song cuts deep
Daammm son, u got it❤i really appreciate u
If you wanna talk about Jews and your addiction then the problem is more than you most likely... Just saying
I would cry if I met you 😢😢😊😊
Great music but would have been better is this was more about food addiction and prescription drugs addiction.
Haven't teared up in years. I've been on both sides of addiction and both suck. But watching your hero destroy themselves and their family is worse.
Beautiful ...so true
This one hits hard !! I pray that anyone battling any addictions makes it out alive
My name is Matt I'm a recovering addict my clean date is 9/14/20
Jelly roll your great no matter how much you weigh
Seeing family members do drugs and die is sad situation waste of a good life.. 😢
This is me and my 19 yr old daughter right now and I'm so lost and don't know what to do. Its killing me. I need help with her
As a current addict, this is giving me the strength to change because I know how my friends feel, without me around, family is not the same life is not the same, like for the first time I had a voice speaking for me, and my sister listened ❤❤ she never listen to me. It's going to be a hard road for me, but what has killed everything in my life hasn't killed me. 1 day sober a million more to go I'm ready I got this. Thanks to y'all
I lost my best friend to his addiction back in December. This song is exactly how it feels even to this day. It changed him in every way possible and I still wish I was there for him more than I was. Addiction is one of the worse things that can happen to someone.
Spent 10 years or more in active addiction.. been clean almost 10 months now… we do recover!
Perspective introspective Joyner
One of the many things I respect and love about Joyner is that he makes music/videos that are thought provoking and he even shows you both sides of the story/perspectives. For someone who wants both sides to the truth/story I appreciate this type of art in the form of music
Unless you’ve been an addict of drugs or alcohol regardless if you’re related to or know an addict, you will NEVER truly understand the immense amount of pain, suffering, hopelessness, and trauma associated with being an addict. It is single handedly the worst thing you could ever experience or wish upon someone else to experience. I would never wish that on anyone. From 2015 to 2021 I was addicted to Percocet and heroin. I lost friends, family, vehicles, homes, my college degree, good jobs, my license, my freedom, and my soulmate. I finally got clean and am going on two years and 6 months. He didn’t make it. When he died, a part of me died too. June will mark two years since he died and I still bawl my eyes out everyday. He deserved better. I’m clean today, and it’s thanks to him. Even having parents who have been addicts my whole life, they still don’t understand from this song’s point of view. I’ve been waiting for a song like this. You two are definitely people who feel us, in your mind, in your heart, and in our soul. You know the pain. You empathize, you sympathize, and you care. We need more people in the world like you who speak volumes for people like us. Judging is easy. But to put ego and opinions and blame aside to really want to know or understand to bring resolve or peace or to heal the struggling, thats a miracle right there. You deserve all the recognition and so much more for this right here. I hope you guys put more out like this. I have nothing but respect for you guys. Thank you so so much for your part in healing lives. ❤
Amazing. I extend my prayers to all individuals who find themselves involved in any form of addiction. I also offer my prayers to those who may not recognize their addictive tendencies, whether it be towards drugs, alcohol, or any other vice. In His name I 🙏🏽 Amen.
Thanks for creating and sharing this guys, much love to you both.
Been clean now for 7 years, i was just gonna leave it at that, but lets be real... i relapsed a couple weeks ago, because i am just so tired of feeling NOTHING. Im just NUMB at this point. Working, sleeping, and repeat. I am not LIVING. Are there any people out there that feel like me?? Why do i feel so alone...
Joyner Lucas goes hard on ever track facts
Joyner Lucas im 12 years sober this hit me hard Fam Massachusetts nation brother
Addiction is no joke!!
Heavy lyrics
Is that joyners daddy
Fucking joyner. Good job❤ People like this that save us in another path God gave. And my boy took it with pride.
This tune is deep and wicked. ❤
❤
Omg 😭🥺🙏🏽
I’ve been battling my porn addiction for what feels like forever, 8 days was my longest nofap streak and that was over 2 yrs ago. Everyday i vow it’s the last time but inside i know im not strong enough to resist. My viscous cycle is self imposed and the only one to blame is myself. Everyday i relapse and most of the time it’s the same day i vowed to quit but the worst isn’t just starting over’ it’s feeding myself the same lie and failing myself… I have never felt as good as i did on that 8 day streak! all the “NoFap”  benefits are actually legit and even i was skeptical however making it to 8 days and experiencing it all was baffling. Nevertheless to my fellow porn addicts please remember you’re not alone.
That shit he just sung is one of the most real songs I have ever heard...
This song is medicine therapy four those are going threw this  pathway, stong powerfully , remix with (nas) ❤❤❤❤❤
I just want to say that this song hit home crazy Joyner Lucas is my favorite rapper and I'm in tears right now cuz I'm struggling with addiction heroin addiction that was given pills for when I got into my motorcycle accident I never knew I'd be addicted to this I just had a newborn 9 months ago and I only seen him a couple times I'm crying right now writing this because this s*** hurts I try so hard I just don't have no support group my mother was murdered in 09 I don't be around nobody and I lost my wife and my son cuz of this it is so hard I just want my wife and my family back and I feel like I'm just stuck in the same position I want to get clean I just want to be able to hold my son and hug my wife Joyner Lucas other song falling slowly was me and my wife's song like that was our s*** straight vibes I'll f*** with Joyner to the fullest but I'm not going to give up hearing this song just makes me want to get clean even more my eyes are watery s*** I can't write no more but I just want to thank him for the song cuz this s*** is deep and real😢😮😢❤
31 years and counting and now I’ve come to the point of wanting to give up again I’m slipping again thinking about the old ways lost the only woman I every loved it’s so hard and now my health is going down hill
5 years of addiction and I was a heroin addict and did an 8 ball of coke every week. Must of spent 200 dollars on heroin a day. As I’m writing this I am 8 days clean off of suboxone. Feeling great. I hope you find your way and get clean it is the way.
To all the people struggling trying to get sober. I pray for no more relapses 🙏
dang been there felt that
Reminds me of dad died at 52 Rip I miss u so much still watching over mom for u
All you have to do is won't it everything else well  come to the light
I want to send this to my mother but I am too afraid..
So good.
❤❤ Jelly Roll I have so much respect for you and what you're doing for addicts everywhere.  This song is another testimony to who you are. SFFS 132 ML&R *GemShiner

Songs like this are what made me a fan of joyner. Storytelling from two different perspectives.
This song hittin my soul, I recently lost my best friend to fentanyl, this song is litterly what I experienced with him, to see my  niggah transition and fall apart hurts me the most. He didn't wanna listin to me, but I should have been the one listening, we both came from the struggle and I should have known and been better .. I miss him and I still blame myself for not trying harder to keep him away ....😔 RIP MY NIGGAH, you'll always be my ride and die. 😔😔😔😔
This song touches my very soul.
My son is an addict. His addiction caught him 24 years in prison. Grieving the loss of a child who is still alive 💔
This ENTIRE track KNOCK harder than Jehovah’s Witness. From the lyrics all the way to the beat and hook… SALUTE 🫡 to everyone involved because y’all definitely hit the mark with this one. 🔥🔥🔥
That’s my dawg wow bro. O grate Man U deservenit
Tomorrow is the anniversary of finding my roomate who od from fent. FLY HIGH SANDY
Damn bro...  I felt that...
I’m Robert I’m pariniod 0:36 schizophrenic my dad turned me onto drugs on my 13th birthday I was trying to save him when I couldn’t save myself I lost my dad to drugs at 19 I went on a rampage I decided to quit at 35 n lost my mind seeing n hearing spent three yrs in two diff😢mental hospital
Just relapsed I'm so fucking lost, I was doing good and then it all fell apart, been reaching out for months and got left on read by everyone. Now I'm spiraling and I don't want to reach out anymore, but I also want to scream for help.
❤❤❤❤
We need more videos and 😢 people to show their hearts ❤!
This song go hard.
my biggest mistake was acting like if she left I'd still live without her is what I wish I said to you 2 years and still morn her death. I hate her addiction it killed us both
Damn this shit is cold AF
❤❤️‍🔥🏹❄️🩵🫦
Song tears me up everytime I listen to it. Everyone atleast know someone with addiction or 1st hand experience. Joyner you are one hell of an artist. How you rap from each perspective is amazing.
I love you sooo much suckafeish 🥺222
This comment section got me crying 😭 ❤
This song was so hard for me to listen to as an addict
I cut my dad off almost a year ago because I couldn’t handle the fight anymore. I think of him all the time. I love him and miss him. Sometimes doing what’s best for our children, kills us inside because we wish our parents would have done the same for us.
As addict that just crushed up some fetty, in a dark room by myself, this song is definitely the truth. I've been trying so hard and for so long to get clean but I feel like there is no end in sight. It's so hard.
Love this for Jelly Roll he's amazing!
This hit me hard bkuz I’m the one who has the problem and I just didn’t wanna realize it I’m a functioning addict . I can’t go an hour with out smoking weed and if I don’t smoke I lose my shit and my bipolar and ptsd starts to act up . I cried watching this bkuz it hit me that I’ve been killing myself slowly unintentionally and destroying everything in my path I live out my car bkuz of my problems and I work as well but can’t afford to live in an apt bkuz of the rent prices . This video made me wanna sober up and try and get the demons out . But they actually I might need Jesus to help with that one . 🙏🏾 hopefully I haven’t sinned to much to be able to receive the lords blessings
this song hits home so fkn hard man. thank you for making this song.... there is a lot of people dealing with this world wide and you just impacted their lives in such a positive way. I've been a fan of jelly roll since the 10 minute freestyle was uploaded back when he was going to record in colt's studio down in owensboro, ky and i've been a fan of joyner for a long time as well. I'm just so fkn happy to see people making positive music in such dark times man. Proud of both of you and everyone that was involved in making this. well done everyone.
Man that was dope healing music is the best music
My older brother was addicted to heroin and meth, living on the streets. I finally brought him to me and he has worked his ass off to stay clean for 3 years now.   Out of nowhere our younger brother died of an overdose last summer. Broke my heart. 💔  Our family has been haunted by addiction. I pray for everyone struggling or missing someone. ❤️🙏🏽
"How come you only there for me when I be trying to get clean". That shit honestly hurts when you realize that he's talking to most of us
I guarantee you tears were dropped writing this song and making this great video.  "I wanna just tell you I love you, in case you don't hear it as much"... This song speaks to the heart
This deserves a Grammy.
❤❤❤😢
As a fan of both from before they got famous this hits deep with family love this song❤❤❤
Damn... just.  Damn
This song hits so close for me. If you dont know  what addiction is like then its a little harder to understand. I recently just relapse on lean and xans again. Cause i lost my sister to alcohol a few months ago. Now im trying to get back on track again and its been a battle. Been 2 weeks  clean so far tho👌😌
MY BROTHER MADE A SONG EXACTLY LIKE THIS YEARS AGO J
Day 67 🖤
joyner this shit is deep i know both sides of this fence and sadly im fighting the hard side right now
jelly you help me get thru some shit bro im hangin on by a thread keep pumpin these fire tracks i need help bro my motivation is on e takes my fumes just to wake another bullshit day. they lied about the american dream. im tired. fuck. when you going to drop something with jamwayne?
4-20-21 🎉 sobriety!!! Lost my brother to fetty 4-20-23 😢 Love this song 🎵 ❤
2 years 11 months and 8 days clean off H 🙏 bless everyone and there struggle with addiction
Yo I really hope that you read this, I'm the guy that's known but not popular I know we never met but I want you to know I really appreciate this song I don't have the words to express what I would like to say. It made me feel like I was talking to me and it really moved me and I'm glad you explained the other side of people addicted to anything. This rite here, makes me want to be a better person, this touched my soul and there's so much more I wanna say but just know I thank you for this song it was like a slap in the face, but with love, I really needed to hear it songs like this is what it's all about, songs like this change people's lives. I'm still not where I am wanna be but I'm trying this really woke me up, progress not perfection but I am trying. Thanks again big brother I hope this reaches you so you know that you touched someone's life I was sleep and I needed to be woke up. Thank you man I'll keep u in my prayers and always appreciate this song, you music and talent, and you. Love ya for taking the time out to make a song like this. I'm the one with the mic stuck in my head
God Damn this was the perfect song for my son who spent 15 years addicted to herion😢😢. Blessed 5 years later he's sober and finally realizing he's not defined by being an addict and he has risen to the top and become successful.  He's one of the few who made it back from the other side.  I pray for everyone who is in the hell of addiction and the ones who are helpless and have to watch from the sidelines.  They are equally as painful, but there is hope and I am blessed I get to have my son alive and sober❤
This one hits me to the core
damn, this shit is something else. powerful af
Songs good Joyner, the one thing that only makes sense is the standard addict , this would hit spot on! ❤ I have a different experience and it’s because of outside variables that play a major role in my life! Not my brain! See that’s the shit that’s incorrect! The fact is I’ll prove it and that will explain a lot about my experience! I’m sure it’s completely different and not subjective at all! The fact is I’m right and I’m not wrong and I would love to discuss something like this with you! Hope you’re doing well man and love your music! Extremely inspiring and always keep it 100! Respect
It's so sad, everyone is addicted to drugs or drinking these days. I know im not alone in the fact that I've lost alot of loved ones and friends to this. I broke that cycle though, my kids will always have a sober and present father. Haven't touched anything since my wife was pregnant with my oldest. My kids won't ever feel like i do, and that's my biggest flex. Pain is a funny thing, you either take it all for yourself and handle it, or you pass it down to those closest to you... make the right choice.
This song, though
@trianjavar2821 I was on heroin! I made it out! He will pull through and be a better person than he was before all we can do is pray
Killed this keep it up .
Damn this song hit hard. Made me miss my brother who chose to get closer when I chose to get sober.. I pray to God one day he'll see the truth
That website isn’t the best. Nice song.
The words to this song from the outside looking in giving both perspectives couldn’t be more perfect! Awesome song! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m so conflicted because I’ve been on both sides of this. I know my kids would’ve been singing this to me. 8 years sober from meth and I still have dope dreams wakin up checkin my pockets. Addiction is a completely different world when you’re trying desperately to escape it. It’s not as easy as black and white imma put the pipe down and do better. You have to leave your entire life behind if you wanna change for the better. Friends and family who are still active in the life callin you a fake Uncle Tom cause you left em behind while trying to do right for yourself, Which furthers your spiral into another deep depression. Dam this song is powerful.
It's amazing how music can touch sooo many souls, Lord allow this message to reach many who struggles with their demons, Amen...
I’m so glad another Latino is making it big with some fucking bangers bro. Como SPM but without the charges lol
I’ve been an addict for 17 years and I’ve been on methadone for 10 of them…I was addicted to pills first then got tricked into trying heroin and got addicted to that now I’m on methadone and this hit me hard!! The meds keep me living a normal life but it is like liquid handcuffs..I am thankful for it tho bc I’m not dead or in the street. This made me cry so hard bc ik so many ppl who have died or lost someone to addiction. I’m am so thankful for songs like this that let regular ppl that aren’t in addiction know how hard it really is! Thank you so much for this!! 🙏
Addiction turns into a disease. It might of been a choice at first, but that shit eats at you. Even after you get sober. The path and road to  recovery and learning to live a clean and healthy lifestyle isnt easy, but is sure is worth it. January 2nd 2024.
I fell in love with a rose that dried up I did my best to bring it back to life even if it ment me ending up in handcuffs time from to time enough was enough but love was tough I gave it my all building steps so she wouldn't fall or lose her peddles threw the storms her sun to keep her warm but her thorns was horns that would make me bleed trying to provide oxygen when I couldn't breath.
Love thus song, wish jelly did a rap tho
Mad respect to jelly roll.
Joyner music speaks my whole life.  In every song in every situation. From "winter blues" to this song.
I don't know what to say I'm extremely emotional about this track it hits so damn hard and home.  THANK YOU!
Damn this song hits harder every time I hear it
Hit home thanks fellas💙🙏🏽 god bless all people trying to get there health in order u got this god loves you ❤️
Whos the guy that did the one verse and went upstairs his verse was so sick. Did he rapp that was it his take.
🎉
To my sister I love you forever 😢
Im 1 hour sober.
would definitely like to see more jelly/joyner collabs 🤘
Addictions are HARD  because you're not battling one demon  But a LEGION!  The worst kind! Vile. Destructive. Unclean in every way  But if u are WILLING to fight to get out the dark  Call out to God!  And prepare for suffering  Bc u WILL HAVE TO SUFFER AND FIGHT TO GET OUT !  But if you are willing , the rescuer will always come!  The light shines in the darkness  And the darkness has NOT overcome it🙏🕯️🙏🕯️
I literally can’t even finish the whole song I keep going back to it but never can I keep crying so much   I miss you brother I love you
Really hits home my brother has been in out of jail and prison his hole life and been on drugs wish he would clean up and get it together it hurts me to see him keep doing this to his self
This is absolutely incredible Joyner.
Damn,that hit deep. 😢
Woman do what the chorus says all the time
Lost my fiance in January 2024 n when I heard this it broke my heart I jus wish I had another chance I can’t n don’t want to live like this without him 💔🙏🙏😔👑🕊️rest in peace king Lou love yu always
one of best deep tracks for real struggle and life pain hit home in me <3
People really need to just sit down and listen to the words being said in this song
Im 61.5 tears cascading down my face for my Daddy deceased, my Big Sisters 2 deceased, My nephew deceased, My Ex Husband, the best I ever had; Alive... but dead. Thanks guys I cant stop playing this my new fav yall just passed my J Cole today. Blessings Guys & Thank You😢

This song touches the soul in way we all need we need this type of music all 2024 🎉song of the year
Gives me goosebumps. They both did equally SO good. The video is perfect too.   So many people struggling with drug addiction.   Sober for 7 years 💪 ❤❤❤ If ur struggling you can get help. I lost my brother to fentanyl 2 years ago this 21st. I miss him so much.
Nice , Jelly Roll
I was in addiction for over 10 years today dates 5 years sober now I’m a coal miner and make over a 100 K a year if I can do it you can do it god bless you.
2 of the best millenial rappers together🎉
Remember it's never too late to save yourself, because only you can be the hero you need to save yourself, I lost five siblings,both parents,other family,tins of friends and here I sit with 11 years clean and I suffer from survivors guilt, PTSD, ADHD,but I stay clean for me so I can be the man my children and wife need,and if your suffering please reach out for help
i relapsed last year….lost my sister to herione and now im trying to get clean. addiction kills…prayers for anyone else who is trying to get clean❤
Say his name: JESUS OF NAZARETH 🙏
Timeless..
Take Me For Me Or Just Let Me Be. Please!!!!!!!
I ain’t doing 5 sit up or 5 push up for every like this gets . But this is dead ass one of the best song I’ve ever heard in my life .
First time hearing this Lucas went off
I will do 5 setups and 10 push up on every comment on this🥺
1 year sober in 7 days and I am so grateful!!!!
I love you all who know what this feels like. It gets better
I never heard him or u but I had to find and listen thanks for this
Way to much auto tune lmao
This is a badd ass sing
This hits home when the person your singing about isn’t coming back #overdosing kills rest in peace Teisha Thurman
Man i am crying me heart out to everyone that we lost on drugs and the one s who are lost.😂😂😂😂😂.
This hits hard. Thank you for this song and i hope all who are on drugs could get clean.
Miss you. Every day.
Thxfor wroting thia song . We needed it. Best to yall ! Xo Joe DRT ❤
🔥❤️❤️❤️🇵🇱
This may be the best song I’ve heard in 10 years
I love both of these artists. I wish i could be blessed with meeting either of these guys. Jelly Roll is so talented. Never been disappointed by either of their music.
this hits me so hard not only was i a addict that got clean but an ex that i aint thought about in quite a while now she let addiction tear our family apart and now my kids aint got a mom shes still alive but the drugs were more important than her own kids fuck me but her kids....
So many internal battles that i been fighting and i think my favorite part about this song is that theres two sides to one coin and that joyner talks from both sides, shit is crazy i heard this song on accident and now im crying hope my life turns around one day cause i havent been able to manifest shit, i aint even addicted to drugs but being a 25+ is hard in 2024
I heard this song for the first time today and I instantly thought of my son, he’s 25 & he’s been fighting his demon for a couple years now; he OD’d twice last year, one time in front of me and it’s scarred me for life; he’s been in rehab and been doing the outpatient stuff but it’s all court ordered; he struggles with wanting to get clean and staying clean. I don’t understand addiction or the true struggles of it, but I know it’s slowly killing me watching my son lose himself to his addiction. This song is beautiful, it needs more attention.
This song makes me cry so much I miss you bro I’m sorry zay 😢you will be missed
BROOO THIS GO HARD BRAA 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🍻🙏
This is the best song of the year right now
I lost 2 friends because of drugs. I miss them so
What a powerfull song. Never listened to jellyroll and never heard if this guy but this song here is at the top of my playlist in repeat
Great song 🎶 about addic😊 tion 😅& how ❤️ it 😊 affects 😅 those ❤️ we 😊 love 😅❤😊 God ❤️ bless 😅 y'all 😊.. ❤️ looking forward to seeing jelly roll perform in Knoxville in October We got tickets last month Very excited it'd be cool if y'all perform together too just 🎉
I am addict ,you make me cry
So greatful for music but this song hits home I have lost so many friends this past year to addiction 😢 At least I know I'm not alone anymore
Alcoholism is so hard to kick 😫 i drink 7days a week 😢ive tried to quit but i always have an excuse i was born a alcoholic bby my mom drink the whole 9 mos
As a person who experience both, this made me cry so much. My dad and uncles were addicted to alcohol and we would go through so much just like this video. I always used to say I would never be like them and now I’m addicted to alcohol 😞 and I want to let it go but I can’t. It just takes the pain away.
“Took me 15 years to get to the top….  The top eh   You’re a shit rapper. wtf you mean the top  You don’t have any banger hits you can’t afford any real good rappers to feature with you your below mediocre buddy fuck stop lying to yourself the top
You made it Joyner, I just heard this song on mainstream radio 🫡
When I first saw Jelly Roll he scared me.  Now, because I listened to him.......... I honor him.
This shit hit different straight masterpiece 👏  👏
3 years in prison and 6 years clean later....I live a blessed life. If anyone needs to talk and ask how I did it, reach out to me
Dang Cuts deep!!!
Too be real you need to kneel/ dissolve the seal that hooked you to the feel/ the fresh breath of youth in the first meal/ now the taste is Miss her, kiss her, love her, wrong move you're dead That girl is poison
Thanks for holding up that mirror Joyner
The song is an amazing song man hands down I I literally am so in love with this song I'm so grateful for you Joyner and so grateful for you jelly roll I was pretty upset with jelly roll and was not liking him for the longest because he backed out of a tech nine concert in Oklahoma City but jelly roll you just showed up with this one I mean you got good music bro but I was hating because of that concert you didn't come to in Oklahoma City but man this songthe song just put me in tears literally I'm battling a 23-year addiction with meth and I'm in love with a girl who has a fentanyl addiction who plays with my head and my heart all the time we've never really dated but she's wishy-washy with me and tells me she loves me one day the next day she doesn't want anything to do with me and she tells me we're just friends but I'm always there for her she doesn't do anything for me and I'm alone a lot of the time my heart is broken and I just don't know what to do I don't know how to get out of this rut and I feel like I'm stuck I've done everything to get sober and it's not happening it's not working and I feel like right now death is the only thing coming up on me besides the cancer that I just found out today that I have
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
All the talk about the big 3 and no mention of Joyner 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥 fucking amazing 👏🏾
My little man saw jelly roll last year in concert with his daddy. He loves him ❤
THIS SONG HERE MANNNNNNN
90 days clean off fetty  This shit hits deep asf
The bass going beast on my speaker ,maybe I need some adjustments
❤❤❤❤❤
Uhm....😢
Showed this to my dad, it made him tear up. We both have lost people close to us from addiction.
Lets get Joyner on our mental health / recovery podcast, Mind Split Cafe!!! I would love to hear his story on how this song came to be.
This is what is the business It's the service that's worth every bit Makes me wanna give it a rip Keep it coming that's the music  I grew up too live what most don't get Is this a dream or a choice we fix Life loved one we don't have to shift When we do my dudes it's a gift So thanks for your words of encouragement  I'm  no longer an addict  as I almost got shot over a few sips
This shit go hard
My mother has unfortunately been an addict my entire life. I'm so scared to lose her...
When i hear joynerns first part of the song, word for word did he take the words out of my mouth. My mom :( my fucking mom. Literally 😢all i can think ab is a stranger to the family who misses her so bad😢.. these songs speak SO MUCH VOLUME
What do I have apart from my excuses...
I will do 5 pushups for every like I get on this comment!! Yall better take it easy
Wow  judt wow 😢❤
Powerful lyrics!! This song truly captures the essence of experiencing addiction from both angles. The message resonates deeply, offering insights from both the perspective of someone battling addiction and their loved ones witnessing the havoc it wreaks.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
This hits!!!!! We all know and love someone that seems they can’t get RIGHT!!! Keep them in prayer, do what you can, and love them . I know it’s easier said than done😢
I lost so many friends to this shit I've been clean for over 5 years, and in that 5 years have had to go to some funerals for people I've known my whole life. It's so sad seeing the people you cared about die from this shit. Heroin and fentynal ruined an entire generation where I grew up
Addiction is going to sue Joyner Lucas for this disstrack...
This song really hits home I was an addict for 12 years and now finally 4 years sober have my family and my children back  if your suffering in active addiction please seek help NA fellowship you are never alone much love ❤
🙏🏾🌋🍻🌆
This song is so beautiful thank you
If you get lost then everyone loses. If you don't believe in yourself then you'll never believe in someone believing in you. Those are some deep lines.
I wouldn't capitalize on anyone like this, but you could.
You have no idea what this means 2 me. I love it and it's the truest message I've ever heard   about this subject
I wish this song came out Three years ago before I lost my mother to addiction. No Matter What? My mother was Stronge enough for us just when we needed her.
This shyt 3 fire.
I.       Fu.     With jelly but that fi in song sucks.     Jelly run from b s
I cant stop crying i have 3sisters on drugs bad so painful to see...and now my only daughter
@trianajavar2821 I have 6 years tomorrow. But I have been to 16 rehabs, jail and tried since 2011. It's hard! I pray he gets through his demons
This hits home. ❤ 😢
2:09 this hits me so hard!!!!!!!!!!
🎉🎉🎉
8 years off heroin/fentanyl in February. I was medically dead from an overdose in 2015. After 3 intramuscular Narcan shots one medic wanted to "call it" but the other said no. Gave me a 4th and I came to. Obviously I was unconscious so how do I know what happened? My mom was in the other room. Spent 5 years roaming the streets of Kensington  If I can do this so can anyone. You have captured the essence of addiction in a masterfully produced collaboration of exceptional artists. This deserves a Grammy and you both deserve the Medal of Honor for being brave enough to say what so many were scared to say. I have a feeling this was for DMX. Joyner God Bless you and your fallen friend and soldier. J Roll I'm sure the Lord is well pleased with his servant. You are very special
My ex sent me this video and I never used drugs before is it a song about addiction.
Good song. Fuck addiction. If you’re trying to quit, remove that friend group. If you don’t, you’re just waiting to relapse. I’ve been clean for awhile. Don’t count days and don’t tell yourself you’re in recovery. That’s just a constant reminder. You are a FORMER addict
This song literally brought me and my brother back together today. He’s an addict who is trying to get clean, and in September he was involved in a motorcycle accident that caused him to stop breathing. He came back, and wasn’t even scathed otherwise. But I went off on him and didn’t speak to him until today, and I heard this song last week, and it put me right there back into my own active addiction, which I’ve been clean 7 years, and reminded me it’s not the person who is driving the car anymore when ur addicted. So I reached out to him through text messages, and he called me. He sounded good, sounded clean, but most importantly, he sounded like my fuckin brother. So thank you Jelly and Joyner for this deep ass track, and know that it is reaching the addicts. I’ve been clean 7 years, and I became very judgemental at first. Looking down on addicts as if it was their fault. This song reminded me of when I was a passenger in my own body, unable to steer away from the heroin and the needle. I took the wheel and turned my life around, I now have a beautiful wife, 5 amazing step children, one who we lost due to complications from addiction, and my blessing, my life, my grandson, who is going to know that no matter what you do in life, good or bad, you can always change it if you really want it
Jelly roll slid on this one 💯
As a recovered heroin addict that's been clean for fifteen years this song really hits because of all the people that i know that are still stuck in their ways.
Almost 8 years clean I fucking love this song hits home so damn hard
@jellyroll615 this chorus really hits a cord in my heart.  @youngmerkules you gotta put your spin on this one🤘
We all needed joyner and jelly to come together🎉❤
This is actually ⛽️💯🗣️
Wow, wow, wow..... The depth in this one is real...
Please jelly roll remix this with your rap style
Truth
one day i'll be commenting on a song like this. my life will be headed in a healthy direction. 100%.
One of the best song in my life
This is the hardest shit I ever heard, wish my brother was still alive!
Sober 306 day off that fent I lost everyone of my friends to the drug or the violence the lucky one or two are still in jail...I'm very blessed Im still here..all I can say is if you want to get clean you have got to change your thoughts to change your behaviors ...just stay ontop of them and it will eventually become natural
This is so beautifully written from both perspectives it’s tragic that so many connect with it though but addiction has touched so many families whether your an addict or love an addict it’s a beast from both sides an there is no one way to recovery,what works for one might not for another it wld be nice if there was a one size fits all fix but I think lack of loving yourself is a common denominator I know if the love I have for my people cld have saved me I wldnt have needed saving take it a day at a time if  you fuck up don’t dwell just start over it’s hard but don’t throw in towel over a mistake
It's hard topic to speak on. Usually people don't turn to drugs just bc of how it might make them lose their problems. It's usually things that have happened in their life. You as a parent ask what did I do wrong. It's okay to ask that question. I've fought this for ten years my mind still drifts towards fuck I can go spend 40 dollars and my problems are gone for a minute. I dont like telling people my story but I do preach. It hurts even then. How can I speak with you when I'm still fighting this issue in my life. I have people in my life so gone. Idk I found God but not all do. I manage my sobriety and maybe it's not healthy but I stay off of things that will kill me
Song makes me miss my bro. Dustin, I miss ya buddy❤️
Song makes me miss my bro. Dustin, I miss ya buddy❤️
There is hope never give up! My whole family gave up on me what changed my life is I was sick and tried of living that way I losted my bestfriend and many others I loved. Today I am almost a year sober from herion may 15th I will be. God is good!! Never give up on someone with addiction and show them to still care.
Been sober from Methamphetamines for almost 6 years now, this hit so hard, when he said “why you only there for me when I’m trying to get clean” I felt that in my heart
My ex best friend of 20 years is addicted to drinking and drugs. I couldn't be there. She never got help only after I left. 😢 this song is healing. Thank you.
where i get my motivation from. my day one🫴🏾. always follow your steps
I coulda seen a young EM tearing this song down
Man I wish these two made a up tempo rap song together when Jelly was still doing his rapping thing. They could made a banger FR. I get this song though and I hope it helps anyone it can. I ain't ready for sober but at least I'm functioning still in life. I'm thankful for that. Anyways still a good song and I NEVER SAW THESE TWO GETTING TOGETHER OR HOPES THEY WOULD LIKE IT WAS ACTUALLY POSSIBLY GONNA HAPPEN. ALTHOUGH I SHOULD HAVE NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT. TWO OF MY MOST PLAYED ARTISTS. GREAT TO SEE THESE TWO PUT THEIR TALENTS TOGETHER FOR A GOOD SUBJECT TO BRONG ATTENTILN TO.....MAYBE THE RIDE AROUND TO BANGER IN THE WORKS FROM THESE TWO NOW. JELLY AINT FORGOT HOW TO MAKE A RAP SONG......
Jell roll Wief love 😮
Goosebumps 🙏🏽
I lost someone just like the video…this hit home
#Free_Palestine
Im 22. 254 days clean. Words cant explain how much this hit my soul. The first time ive been sober since i can remember. Ill have to fight this forever, but a least i can listen to something that doesnt make me feel so lost. I WONT LOSE, i refuse to ♡
I'm not a Big Fan of a lot of music, and yes I was once Lost in addition. BUT THIS HERE SONG,Fucking Speaks Volumes....LOVE IT❤❤❤
🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🌋🤘🤘
I have a daughter that is addicted to crystal meth so this song hits deep for me alot of his music hits deep with me i just keep praying i wont give up on her cuz i cant lose ahe has OD 2 times already 🙏 💔🙏🙏❤️❤️
Thank god for my family this really hits deep this was me over 2 years ago now after 10 years of fighting addiction 2 years sober family friends are god sent thank you all and thank you both for this song it’s real
Thank u so much for making this song it hits the spot in my life that I'm at right now.  Thank u
This Right Here Is Special.
I lost my best friend to an overdose a week after this came out please get clean so many people love you and miss you
I used to do pills like it was candy this song made a difference in my life thank you jelly and Joyner
Wow 🥺 This hits home. It hurts so bad dealing with a sibling with addiction for so many years but they have to want to get better for themselves. I pray everyday for my bro. I love him dearly 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Can't love this song enough♡
@joynerlucasofficial Amazing song... amazing message.
🙏🏼to all in a struggle one luv 👊🏼u can do it !
This is powerful 😢sometimes we don’t understand addiction and what people going threw
“When you don’t believe in yourself yourself then you’ll never believe in somebody believing in you “ 💯💯
If you don't believe in your you'll never believe in yourself
Thank You, Thank You, Thank You Joyner. You are to cold with the story telling. Nobody is to far from addictions grasp, whether you an addict or someone close to is. Much Love from an addict trying to get it right.❤
I love everyone God bless to those struggling with addiction there is hope plz trust me I've been there at the bottom and I made it out and u can to always remember that u r loved😂🎉
7yrs clean and going had to let go of my wife she doesn't wanna stop I hope one day she will b ready I'll b rite here waiting I love that woman hardest thing I've dun is to walk away from her😢
aRT❤
Joyner is so underrated man.
Joyner is getting better and better with every song he puts out. He knows how to address issues that people go through.
😢 amazing….
For anyone that is suffering from any addiction, just know that someone other than yourself needs you to be sober. If you don't know who that someone is you might have not even met them yet. For me it's my daughter. Our children deserve it if nobody else does. Help is out there. A better life is waiting for you! ❤🙏
This song hits so hard with me and my son. He is on the "blues" and it seems like I'm loosing him and being a mom it's hard to fight something that's way stronger than me .
❤
I'm fighting my best....
Dude this song is amazing, you both did exactly what you needed to with this one!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙏🏼❤
Always love your shit lucas cant belive you did somwthing with jelly you both some my favorite artist when it comes to real problems i deal with everyday.
2 of the artists I been rolling with long before they ever blew up and only had like 100 thousand subscribers. Now they both huge and collaborating 🔥☠️
This is the relationship I’m having with my son. He’s addicted and has literally said these things to me. Worrying about where he is and what he’s doing is absolute torture. I’m afraid neither one of us is going to live.
That was a really solid piece of art right there. Salute.
Dang this almost made me cry
I don’t care for both Joyner or jelly roll, y’all idolize these people who are flawed, they mention God but judging a tree by its fruit their message is far from God, the Bible is the strongest thing we need, not a song that keeps us guessing, a song is never definite, especially this song just leaves you walking away with your head down still confused, SURRENDERING TO GOD FULLY IS THE ANSWER! THE SCRIPTURES IN GODS WORD WILL MAKE IT VERY CLEAR ON WHAT TO DO. Forget this song and REACH FOR GOD AND HIS WORD!
Too real.
Man fire song ... I had tickets for your show in Toronto! Ended up trading them for a eight ball 😓
My two favs ❤❤❤❤❤
This dude joyner don't make music he makes a story with a message
Now this song is on my top 10 favs
My best friend that I’ve known since I was 10 has been clean for over a year now and I can’t tell you how proud I am of him. These lyrics really captured some of the conversations I had with him. Shit got me tearing up  so glad my friend is still alive. I pray for anyone who is going through addiction or have a love one struggling with it. It’s hard to watch.. all I can say is have faith, hope, be present, and just listen to them ❤
“How can you love someone and learn to let them go?”  Loving someone deeply involves recognizing that their well-being and happiness are paramount, even if it means sacrificing your own desires or letting them go for their own good. It's about embracing the concept of unconditional love, where you prioritize their needs above your own and find peace in knowing that you've made the best choice for both of you, even if it's painful in the short term.
I love this song so bad... It's hard to get out of drug but whit got God some one will left that life.. I did it n is the best I did in life... God bless the person who is reading this..
I went through pain as an addict everything and everyone you’re around gets hurt and it really tears me apart I been going cold turkey because my son is my life and my family showed me they loved me and never left my side I hurt everyone time and time and they never gave up but now life is a joy I won’t give up my kid and family will always be the motivation for this all💯💯💯 take this as a message it’s never too late we’re destined for greatness never give up LIVE AND LET GOD💯💯🙏🏼
How do I get one?
THIS THE MUSIC THE WORLD NEED !
Joyner *THANK YOU* ur music *ALWAYS* hits for me, but sometimes it's deeper then others.... this is 1 of those times... I needed this rn, onna few diff levels frfr 🙏🏻💯 N I cant fuccin wait till u come bacc to Vegas again !!!! Ur show was so mfin *LIVE* !!!!!! #ForeverAFan 💙
I had to detach with love from my brother in 2017 after watching him use heroin for 12 years. It was one of the hardest things I had to do. I pray he gets sober
This hit home too hard.
This song hits home hard,  just lost my homie, my friends husband of one month due to this, when will this stop! So many loss life I pray for all who deal with addiction to overcome and be set free. Rest in peace samr
Mayonnaise hip hop is at a all time low D12 wasnt so bad now
Y’all really need to listen…… really listen.
How are people not seeing joyners gift to reach people thru his story
Just hearing this guy for the first time today, I’m really feeling his music.
Jelly roll doesn't need auto tune but this song hits home way to hard
This song is gonna win awards I can tell y’all that
My granddaughter loves you so very much and her   Mom passed away when she was 3 years old she never got to say goodbye to her mom and she is struggling with depression her name is kc vaca and she is 13 years old now thanks to you jelly roll she is making her life worth living she has been listening to you ever since her mother passed away
This really hits me , my love just left me. We were both fighting these demons. I realized that we were not going to work. I will always love you. I hope that you are happy. It took me to see my brother is getting his toe amputated tomorrow.  I have to step up. It time to let go and let god take over
I love you bro
It was never love! It was always a trap. I just finally had enough, and walked away…
Just came across this song. Been clean 15 years this song fucking hit home. The struggle is so fucking real still 15 years later! Always 1 moment away from starting over!!!!!
Coming from someone who was once the addict and now 7 years clean I appreciate this song so much. ❤
I Lost my Daughter to That Fucking Fentanyl 😢
I love how jelly roll is like an angel in the video
Eyelash sleepless nights to my 19 year old son being an addict it kills me to watch it
Joyner Lucas is super talented!
Love these types of songs from you bro!
This sounds horrible
Joyner Lucas will definitely become a movie director in the future 😉
joiners second verse has got me in tears
This hits on soooo many levels
My brother went to rehab after I sent him this .. thank god prayers appreciated
Feel it
Perfect combo, I love ❤️ this song.  Jelly roll sounds like an angel 😇
This song speaks to all walks of life ❤ addiction tears apart so many families my father was addicted to crack I was an addict at one point and got clean with the help of kratom. A lot of my family still struggles with their addictions and it breaks my heart because you can’t make them change until their ready and sometimes they never change like my father he is almost 60 and still in prison all we can do is pray 😢❤
This fucked me up
i hate this song.. only because
❤❤❤ but it brings me to tears every time... #sober9yearsnow  #INowWorkinHarmReduction
I was a addict for 9 years. I was a garbage can, would do anything I could get my hands on. I’ve been clean 8 years on September 11th. Only you can make the choice to get clean and have a positive motion. I’m very blessed. Thank the lord
Good song
❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥hoping my bro gets the help he needs ❤
Let’s fucking go Tom🔥🔥inspirational as always dawg love your music
This shit hit my heart hard! Lost my dad bc of drug use!

Just Sent This to My Daughter... 😢😭😭💔 Fentanyl Has Taken Over and Damaged Every Fiber of Her Being and I Am Only Holding on My a Fiber... I Miss Her, I Miss the Little Girl I Gave Birth To and Raised, That Happy, Loving, Smart, Vibrant Beautiful Little Girl I Used to Know... She's Disappeared😢😭😭😭
11 years clean from heroin on October 8, the same day my fiancé was murdered in 2021, but I’ll never go back.
Not so fun fact: this feels like being in love with someone with depression.
Heavy Song
Hands down the best lyricist since Eminem
joyner
😇
Had to come back and listen again 🔥
https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=hfYH9QwsdMI&si=uZutaRZTRJrFS2ti

IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SONGGGG🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love your music ❤
Lost my older brother to fentanyl this gave me chills.
Hits hard ❤️‍🩹
This song hits my core makes me cry and I love it Soo much
Here goes ,my daughter has been missing for 11 years now😢 in march , growing up she was my baby girl ,i was young wen i became a father but 1 look into her eyes made me man up,  her mom would alway  say she got all my shit ways growing up lol ,but thr one thing we definitely had the same taste in music ,we bothe are eclectic,so our taste includes classic right threw to hip hop ,we always recommend and sent each other music 😊, at the age of 20 she was raped witch lead to drugs that turned into a 2 year battle with drugs ,i saw my. Daughter slip away everyday, every day was a battle with her trying to get her the help she needs but no avail ,she left the house 11 years ago ,not to be seen or heard of again, i isten to her fav songs often wen i need to feel her near, over the years since she been gone there has been a few songs that I've listen and sed to myself she would have loved this song ,so brings me here ,not only would she have loved this, but the  words are hitting hard ,i have this song on repeat since hearing it this morning,😭😭😭😭😭😭😭, made me think how would things have been right now if she was still around " 🎙️how can we fall apart on things we'll never know🎙️,😢 🎙️and if u get lost every one losses 🎙️,you got lost babygirl , and every one close to u is lossing  cause you not around, so if u read this Nicole please come  home ,we miss you need ❤
Joyner is a mastermind. Hands down.
Another masterpiece from Lucas  🙌🏽
I feel like thats me on the ground 😔
As an active addict this song has hit me hard. I miss my family and most importantly my kids. I'm going to detox and inpatient and showing my babies their more important then these little blue devils
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We need more music like this. Music that adds no value is always top trending but this needs to be number one.
How can u love someone and learn to let them go 😢
Addiction is demonic
I am in love with  someone  who is  addicted  to meth an.i can. Not keep doing  it
🔥🔥🔥🙌 God bless both of yall, Joyner and Jelly!
This hits so hard for me man
this song helps me with my addiction to alcohol
This song hits deep I'm 34 my mom has been a addict since i was 5 damn i just sent this to her i really wish she would have stayed
I can relate to this in more than one way 😢
The chorus is rough but I got through it and wish someone pushed through my walls that I set up to help me. I pushed people away and the ones that understood that I only did that to make it easier for myself and didn’t believe me have continued to be my greatest friends to this day.
The vick is all we can to them..then we gone
Joyner your right we are here and life as a bean town is ...
Joyner and Jelly, y’all may not see this but I used the number at the end of this video for my friend.  I’ve been through my shit and I looked it up for my friend.  Just so you know… on that website that it guides you to, there’s a pop up for alcohol and accidental deaths.   The website is for everything but you have to scroll down a bit to find what I was looking for if you know what I mean:   Hope this gets rectified because the pop up made it seem more important than the rest of the addiction issues.   Thank y’all, Casper
Not a fan of the yelawolf knock off sound this song has. Rather would hear anything other than county with my rap. They go together like a nugget and a bycicle.
FUCKKK
Joyner with another banger 🔥.! This could potentially save someones life big bro.! Much respect 🙏🏻
Coming up on 9 months clean, and I can't even begin to tell you what kind of impact your guys music has had on the recovery community. Please never stop what you do
Made me cry as a man. Truth  😅😅😅 but then no end.
This hit so hard . It's like I needed to hear this song .
BEST SONGS 🎵 ♥️
Jelly Roll hit different no homo
i
There you go again Jelly! Touching my soul ❤
JELLY
Song got me tearing up thinking about my cousin that killed himself after struggling with addiction.  We ended not on good terms. You know I love you buddy. Rip Keaton ❤
Jelly Roll needs Jesus
Burned lol
I’ve had this saved on my playlist for about 2 weeks or so now. Today was the first time I listened to this song, not knowing what it was about. I literally got chills. Today marks my 3 year anniversary being clean. Thank you 🙏 this hit home. Prayers for anyone struggling with addiction, recovery is possible.
We need to stop calling this guy underrated. His musical and video concepts are undeniable works of art, salute to positivity king. Honestly, I believe this will save a life.
Addiction is not a disease its a struggle was addicted to heroin now 2yrs sober I quit cold turkey
Dam that shit just hit me 😮
God is Able! ❤ Sending prayers to our loved 1s fighting the battle.
I can't stop listening to this 😭
Jelly roll ❤️🤲🏽
💔🕸️🌪️
🔥 make a song with hopsin!
What a powerful song
As an addict myself i truly believe addiction is a disease. I know it its. Almost my whole family are addicts. However the only person that can cure this disease is yourself. Never forget that
WOW
May God keep blessing you and your family
Just sent this to my birth mom
This hit's so hard😢❤
🙏👊 1 day at a time yall.
RIP UNC
Lost my brother 7 years ago today to this disease. RIP Phil 🙏☝️
Gives me goosebumps, I’m a former addict, and I have friends and family I’ve lost to drugs and alcohol. The best music is when artists speak from their own personal experiences, and the greats can articulate and draw you in with gifted lyrics from their heart and soul. Joyner Lucas got screwed over by record labels who continue to exploit artists and steal all their money, but Joyner came over that with his manager who actually believed in him and wanted to see him succeed. In the Math Hoffa podcast Joyner and his manager said the real work starts when you get signed to a label, if you think you made it just by getting signed you will end up broke and possibly even losing the rights to most of your music. Math Hoffa and his crew really do try and promote positive things, and want to educate these young men out here to becoming stronger and wiser.

I am so in love with this song. I totally get both sides 😢
Lost my homie today, my homegirl's husband and baby daddy to drugs. Shit hurts to see so many go due to drugs this has to stop. I can't take it anymore. Rest in peace Chipmunk
As a true bonified addict/alchohic/you name it.. how do you tell your family you are this drug addict/alcholic that you are and not expect the same or worst consequences from family that you tried to hide the whole time? Sometimes it’s just an easier out to od on something and numb yourself before the fight.. it’s not so easy as telling the truth is easier than a lie.. sometimes to keep it hidden the best you can is the easiest out
This song me opencmy eyes no lie I'm 1 month sober as I write this
Having a dad who is battling addiction still, this song had me sobbing.. this song is so important and I’m so glad y’all made this. Thank you Jelly Roll and Joyner ❤️
My best friend od'ed a few weeks ago and this song makes me cry everytime I hear it.
I'm literally crying right now to this 😔God bless you Mr m Lucas sincerely Splash
The heartstrings pulled 😢
Pray for me
Feel like your talking to me 💯
This song is amazing! The words to this song and the video are incredible. I cannot imagine you guys not getting an award for this. It really touches your heart.
Everybody says they can relate but can they really good job jonyer
Jelly spit your vs not just a lead joyner did great but there is more feelings to be spoke
We all our out here hurting not only here in America but all over the world 🌎🌍 and we need to start taking a conscience effort and look not inside ourselves and love thy neighbor and heal heal!!
WOW I DON'T HAVE WORDS .,AMAZING
The Jason Lee interview brought me here. I had no idea who this was.  Now I do 👍🏾 great song! Continued success
This Was so intense and real, if your struggling with hard drugs or liquor know u can quit if just stay clean a month you’ll feel so much better. As for me, I just keep it real with my caffeine and weed, no hard drugs and liquor for me and it’s meant I’m 4 times the man I used to be.
Been a fan since Ross capicchioni … Joyner Lucas is underrated
I lost my dad to an acute drug overdose after years of addiction. This song hurts and feels so real at the same time thank you! ❤
This song came out a couple days after I lost my big brother to an OD😭   I wish I could have sent him this song😞😞🙏🏼
🔥🔥🔥
So many people use drugs. God please be with everyone that is struggling in life with everything. God help us all. Don't let us go.
MY FAVORITE ARTIST EVER . EVERY SONG HITS THE SOUL EVERYTIME
Lost a good friend to his addiction to drugs….this song makes me cry almost every time.
I spent years in addiction... It's a beast. I have almost 6 years clean this June 10th. I now have a beautiful and amazing daughter struggling with the beast... This song literally brought me to tears thinking about her. I've also lost so so many friends to this shit. Spending prayers and love to everyone struggling
My brother committed suicide earlier this year and we discovered he was addicted to Heroin.. he hid it from everyone and it eventually took his life. If you know someone struggling with this please help them. I wish I could’ve done better for my brother but we lost contact over the years. All I’m left with is childhood memories and no real understanding of his life or the things he was struggling with.
To everyone who's found sobriety congratulations super proud it's hard. Stay strong life is beautiful. To those who are seeking sobriety, you can and will do it, please find support, someone will help you. To those who have never dealt with addiction be kind you have no clue. ❤❤❤
My heart is breaking watching my granddaughter go down the same dark path her Mom did. There has been so much loss this past year, her boy's Dad, her Mom, and her baby, all because of addiction 💔😭
General I love your fairies this good song
Cry tears praying for my mother sobriety all my life!
anybody know who the actor is opposite joyner??
Aw shit I'm cryn
No one aspires to grow up and be an addict, to lose their family, friends, jobs and mostly self respect. I also know you can't love someone to death, self presevation has to come in at some point. Addiction is not selective, it can and does happen to anyone who sees no other way out of their internal misery and suffering. Problem is, you go to bed and wake up with thise same problems. It's a temporary sollution that ultimately costs more than any misery you have ever experienced.  Kudos to you Jelly Roll for being a survivor and showing people there is a way out and hope is never beyond their reach.
I live around the corner from Kensington.. be very proud your self
I lost my dad at 4 years old and now I’m watching my stepdad do the same thing that took my dad from me. I’m so mad that every father figure or man has let me down all my life.
Deep song that hits hard. This is how music saves.❤
In a world of Jcole and K dot, be a Joyner.
Who dude with jelly n Joyner
Album of the year ❤
Song of the year
this shit is literally a masterpiece, sums up both perspectives of 1. the addicted and 2. the people around the addicted, perfectly.
WOW that's a deep and so real!!!! I pray for EVERYONE shackled to addiction!! Never give up!! NEVER!! Turn it over to God, hit them knees day and night and talk to God,he has you but you have to want the change, you absolutely must change people, places, and things!! You have to be completely honest and vulnerable,step out of your shame and guilt!!! You have to cut people completely off unfortunately that may be some family members!! Love them from a distance. God has you, surrender wholeheartedly!! It's so worth it I promise all of you out there struggling!!!! Love you my brothers and sisters!!!  Surrender turn to God!!!!!!!!!❤
Im so glad he's finally gone back to his story based songs. They are what blew him up!
Joyner and Eminem need a song together, that shit will be deep.
Thank you all for giving us this i pray anyone struggling with addictions finds a way to say I AM STRONGER THAN YOU !!
Banger 🎉
Deep
My mother was always battling with drugs and addiction throughout her short life. She wasn't really in my life much and our relationship we did have was rocky, but I'll never forget that morning I woke up to the phone call that she had taken one too many pills last night and OD. RIP mom, this song hits home.
This song is everything I’ve been going through. I love him so much but I have to choose me. It’s mourning a loss deeper than someone passing…
💔
Gave me goosebumps ... Phenomenal song!
Addiction is a long and rough road to be on and it's hard to kick them habits but just know you can overcome your struggles and change your life for the better so stay strong and don't be afraid to ask for help bc we all are brothers and sisters 🙏💯
Do what's best for me, comes directly from JC so quit looking on the inside and realize what's meant to be. It is for him to be made strong when and where I am made weak.
Yooooo this one right here 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤯💯 anybody can make a catchy song but not many can make a song with meaningful content!!  Dawgy definitely clowned with this… and got my boy Jelly Roll on the hook🤯🤯🤯😎
Man what a msg great job u 2 life itself is a struggle everything that's added on makes it impossible to survive in this life to those who made it out congrats and 2 those still fighting keep ur head up every day and everyone say a prayer for those we lost from not having that conversation we all wish we had with someone
15 years of addiction 😢  1 Year 3 Months 19 Days Sober ❤  *edit* 1 Year 8 Months & 27 Days  We do recover 🫶🏼✌🏼
Autotune 🤮
😢
Thank you so much for this guys as a mother with two addictive sons I had to cut them off and it has been hard too but I'm going to release that pain today blessings go up
I can’t even describe how this made me feel. This is…ouch. But a necessary ouch.
This song is VERY necessary, and relatable!!! I appreciate the way the song gives the experience from both sides. God bless all who are battling addiction, and those loving/caring for the person addicted. It's tough!!!🙏🏾
07/25/2023 & 03/03/2023 I lost two siblings to opioid overdoses… I’ll never be the same. My heart aches everyday. Thank you for this song and visual..
Beautiful song. I feel every single word. This song describes my real life situation. It’s hard. I’m the one who’s hurting others tho..
God take care of this man 🥰
This label has the worst PR staff in the business ✋️'s down
So many people have no idea this album dropped
OMG this song is POWERFUL TRUTH!!!   I CAN RELATE... BEEN THERE... AND UNFORTUNATLY STILL HERE. .😞
Lost my fiance to drugs she passed away a few weeks ago. This song really hits hard!
What a master piece
Bro Joyner the hardest bro 😂
I wish I could like this song a million times , I’ve lost a few really close friends and niece to addiction. I know this song will help so many people just like all your other music ❤️❤️❤️
Who is other guy
This song is so sad it's making me cry...
As a former drug addict, this song hits hard. In 2019 i made the decision to get off heroin and meth, and leave my girlfriend at the time cuz she didn't want to get off drugs. She kept telling me if you love me you will love me for me drugs and all. I lost myself and still to this day im not the same. I lost a lot, my friends a lot of my family, everything i owned. But mostly i lost myself. Stealing food just to survive. Stealing from people you love. I still to this day hate myself for what i did. I may be off drugs but i still hate what I did and thats 4 years i cant get back. thanks for this song showing both sides.  A lot of people dont understand the struggle. glad im clean and im living a productive life with a good job. Just mentally its draining
I wish you’d come home beanie. I miss you and I pray you’ll see we love you and want you sober.   Missing since December 28th
I wish I could get my parents to understand this like the dichotomy of this song 64 days . Clean god bless
since 2013 ive been a loyal follower of Joyner, watching him evolve from a local artist to an inspiration is why i Still to this day  will always like, follow and share all things Joyner. This collab w Jelly Roll was one of the best, keep on keeping on !!!
This shit hits home!! I hope someone hears this that needs too!!
🖤🖤🖤🖤💔💔
That’s is one talented man. What a strong message ❤ on repeat.
❤❤❤❤
15 years clean and this still hit me all in my feelings. My God these 2 just made the best song I have heard in a long time. Jelly's verse punches you in the throat to wake you up and Lucas's rap draws you in. I have been on both sides of those lyrics and both sides suck! Thank you two for this beautiful song!
He'll yeahh.. as a person who has gone threw this an had no one I always had guilt doing it but the trauma I was running from it's not bc I was weak it's bc it hurt an I didn't wanna hurt no more so heron was my escape. Until it took a stranger to notice an I realized I had to seat in it it's hard but anyone can do it once u realize life is bout lessons ...much lov ..remember u arnt alone anymore
I miss my sister. My best friend. Her daughter misses her too
Shoutout to Joyner every album he comes with an message ❤
For every like this get will be one day of sobriety
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love Jelly roll
Second verse so relateable
PERFECTION
Oone of the best ♥️✌️
*Hook* How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  *Verse 1* Yeah, I got somebody I love (yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (whoa) But I wrote this song in hopes when they'll hear it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it as much (whoa) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and makin' you feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (do what you might, whoa) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (lose it) And you in denial about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me   *Hook* How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?   Verse 2: Look, I know you been callin' for me (yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (uh) How do I let go of something I know is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me  *Hook* How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?
Droppin facts on a dope track ( pun intended) 🔥
Not a dry eye 😭❤💔❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹
This song rips me apart because I’ve been in every angle of this. The one saying each verse and the one receiving it too. Seeing someone you love destroy themselves is maddening and being lost and trying your best, but still failing is too. I don’t know if addiction is a disease or not, but I know that it’s real and I know no one enjoys it. Neither the witness or the user. Prayers out for anyone struggling with and throw one in for me too, cause I’m still in the thick of it.
I fucking hate how much I feel from this song!
Dam Jelly Roll your voice is absolutely unbelievable in this wow what the heck
My brother is on meth I keep trying but ant getting no we're I just want my bro back we had a life
Sent this to my niece who is an addict for over 10 years now. She recently got out of jail. She promised my father and I she would spend time with us and she hasn't been here at all. It's been about 4-5 weeks.
Wow!!!!! Facts!!!!
Like this commet if you lost someone you love😢
Soft
Both are amazing artists and this song does have a powerful message that probably touches many people who all at one point have been touched by addiction 💕
This song hit hard.. me dealing with addiction back in the day and than dealing with ppl that I love that are still addicted 😢😢😢😢😢 this song is on repeat..
https://youtu.be/S9S65YI3xzA?si=_KGkgGLbl0zl4jQT
Underrated MC! My cousin died 3/28/24 due to OD. This song hit me hard, and I wonder if my cousin had a chance to listen to it before his passing. Well written and cuts deep, thanks!
This hits hard ❤️🤟💯 we do recover because there is nothing in this world that is impossible
You have no idea how much I relate to this thank you
Dealing with coke addiction just seen this today and ive already been trying to quit after seeing this it will be on repeat and i fell like god is trying to save me ive been seeing signs left and right.....
I officially love this man (jelly roll)
Lost my best friend to a relapse OD a little over a month ago. I heard this song for the first time just half an hour after getting home from his celebration of life, i wish it was out before he left us, this shit hits close to home. Amazing song💯 R.I.P Derek 🙏 4/18/1990 - 2/28/24🕊
I Was Here Since 1994🙏🙏🙏🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪💷💷💶💶💴💴💵💵💰💰
Damn bro so real
Crying as a write this addiction is very real and destroyed my life. Hoping my YouTube channel will get me out of this
Bro is stopping me from going down that hill
My mom made a point to show me this video. I’m a recovering heroin addict and the person I care about most in this world is my younger brother, it’s hard to come to terms with the pain I brought upon the people I care about most. Praying for all those still fighting the hood fight, RIP Joey, Rip Chris, Rip Mikey.. so many more.. 🙏🙏
Jelly roll killed this
These songs and videos are so powerful- I’m not Racist, Sorry, Best For Me. Honestly, Joyner is so underrated!
ADDICTION - Giving up everything for one thing! RECOVERY - Giving up one thing for everything!
Jelly roll definitely should've had a verse on this track. Still 🔥 though
I only have 30 days I just seen this idk man that shit hit hard
My boy Painter Mike...doing big things.
Awsome
Bro you only got 2 or 3 ms to your name bc thats the value of your assets not how much youve made or how much is in the account. You want that to go up, simply buy more stuff. 😂😂😂 i hope that line wasnt fr aint no way my boy too good with words and dont know that already
Heard this for the first time today and it ended me
Not enough people are listening to him for me !!!
I saw this played it and it hit me. I had to wait to listen later. This one hit me in the soul. I said fuck you to meds in 2016. It’s been a hard lonely road all on my own. No one acknowledged it and no one talks about my recovery. I did it for me. But I keep losing people and there’s no words.
Lastpriest ya need to hear this one ❤❤
I miss you christopher aaron myers. Bro I think about you everyday. I'm sorry you felt like there was nothing else.
you music saved my life after 3 years of drugs im happy where i am now and going on 4 years sober
That hit like they were talking to me, I push away the ones I love, I couldn't not tear up to all that, questions that I ask myself.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ marvelous collaboration and so many are dealing with this in so many ways!!! One of favs Joyner Lucas🫴🏾💐💐💐🔥🔥🔥 Jelly Roll so dope!!!!🔥🔥
I felt this 💯 this song is fire 🔥 love it!
I desperately needed to hear this song!  I really miss juice wrld tho! No one speaks for addicts!
Love this one
Very powerful song. ❤
Hell yea fuck addiction praying for his recovery he deserves it
Reebok omni pumps!!
Heroin, pill and cocaine addict for 7 years, I choose to get sober 8 years ago and never looked back. I was homeless, in jail, mountains of debt and lost everything I ever owned I never thought I would get my own place to live or be an independent functioning member of society. Now I have built my own home, have 3 beautiful girls and everything I could ever want. Every once in a while a song really hits me and reminds me of how lucky I am to be out of that life and to remind those still fighting they can make it out too! As hard as it is to make it through, it's incredible on the other side and I am grateful everyday that I lived long enough to be ready to get sober. I tried for years, in and out of rehabs, cold turkey, family helping, friends helping but it didn't happen until I had truly just had enough of living that way. I was looking at possibly year's of jail when I decided to finally stick with it. It took me 60+ days in jail and rehab, if I had left sooner I would of relapsed. It was the only time I actually worked at it and wanted it. Several people I used to know and hang out with weren't so lucky and they overdosed while trying to get sober or they just never made it that far. To the loved ones of addicts, they do need you, please don't enable them as it only prolongs their use, but that doesn't mean you can't still love them, talk to them, support them mentally and be there to help when they are ready because they will need you when they are. My family never gave up on me and if they had I don't know if things would of turned out the same. Forever thankful to be where I am today, 8 years clean and sober from all substances.
I'm playing Russian rolet listen to this and 3 songs later I found 3 times my gun should've went off! I'm trying my best to find my purpose when I work my ass off for nothing it seems like!
Crazy just buried my best friend to and my brother-in-law next week lost my little cousin a year to the day all from overdose and found this song 20 minutes ago literally just broke me down life is so fucked up😭
Damn .. this song choked me up.  Halfway through the first verse I was about to send it to some one, then the second verse hit and the rebuttal / argument is so compelling, I don’t know what to do.  Me I know both sides.  The sober side more, either way this song is too real too deep 🤦🏾‍♂️
This song is a song I Dislike being interrupted when it is interrupted. Automatically restart Joyner Lucas keep up the work. Highly appreciated.💪🏾
I pray everyone who's struggling with addiction funds peace with this song I lost my uncle who was my best friend to fentanyl
I was hooked on crack cocaine it was bad i wanted to quit soo bad i tryed multiple times the last time i tryed i some how new this was it, almost 7 years clean now il never goo back im one of the lucky ones, dont give up keep pushin you can do it, prayin for you and i love you 🙏🏻❤
😭😭😭
This shit fire. I wish jelly had a verse tho.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
As someone who witnessed a loved one battle addiction for years this was really powerful and deep 😢❤
Love this
Dammmm
Real Rapper Real things diversity
This song really pulled on my heart strings; I absolutely loveee Jelly Roll and his music 🎶 I was a heroin addict for years.... Started with pills ended up being I.V. junkie. And had a just lost my brother & then got pregnant and got pain meds from my C-section and then it began.... I'm not 2 years and 4 months THANK YOU GOD!!! I'm on M.A.T. you can say I'm not clean if you want becuz im on methadone but if it wasn't for Methadone I would of been dead by now for sure. It started happening on a regular basis that I would have to try and keep my boyfriend awake or narcan him and many many others. I've lost every single one of those people that I meant whenever that was my life style some of the MOST BEAUTIFUL SOULS in the WORLD have been taken from us because of this fuckin fentanyl bullshit and EVERYTHING ELSE!!! Pretty bad when you already gotta have a talk with ur 8 year old son to NEVER EVER take a pill from ANYONE other than prescribed by ur doctor and sometimes those doctors don't even have your best interest at heart & can kill you dead also if you were to take more than normal. Anyways I Pray ANYBODY STRUGGLING WITH ANY KIND OF ADDICTION THAT GOD WILL HELP YOU GET THROUGH IT AND LIVE THE WONDERFUL SOBER LIFE AGAIN, my prayers are with all those still suffering!.🙏🏼 All that living that life will do for you is kill you or put you in prison and it's a CONSTANT fucking chase. You CAN DO IT!!! But remember!! You have to want it for yourself! When enough has finally becomesvENOUGH🙏🏼Go get on methadone and then slowly taper off it. It's better than have a needle 💉 in ur arm 25/8...... GOD BLESS YOU ALL! 🙏🏼❤️
Seen all 3  sides of  this song.   This should be a gospel song with a few altered words Thank you jelly Keep on Rolling
I'm addicted to this song!
This video made me cry ❤ Thank you
Addiction is damn hard.. But the truth is no one can make any stop doing it. They have to save themselves. That's the sad part. Because we be running and running from ourselves and can never see how anyone would understand our pain. I'm so glad I gave up and got clean on my own. NA/ AA didn't work for me; I had to go to a Religious Program and get the demon outta me to live free. It's still hard to put I'm way more happier than I've ever been in my life. We have to know when it's no longer fun. I didn't want to live in pain to still be running from pain. Thats when I knew I was over it all. Saved my life.  Life is short and I want to enjoy my time while I'm here.
🔥🔥
I am  A plumbing master artist  Not a singer  🎉115  Addiction is real 🔥
I don't know what y'all talking about but the truth is don't be rude to people ain't nobody business if he's homeless or not it ain't nobody's business and it might be his wife or whatever and ain't nobody's business
Best song for any and all forms of addiction! This shows both sides of one situation. And there is many different sides to all situations that go along with addiction and mental health.. This song hits the heart and soul for me. Straight Fire!
Jelly roll
Fuckin amazing track!
I sent this to my dad I haven’t spoken too since he bailed on me to run the streets with dudes my age tryna act like something he wasn’t. This song helped me realize, my dad was a kid at one point, and maybe I shouldn’t be bitter forever, he has tried to make things up and I kept shutting it down, guess I wanted to feel hurt rather than accept my father was flawed, to all those with parents who failed at thier role but still want to try, give em a chance this time around, might not end well, but at least you met them half way this time. And to my old man and my mom, sorry I didn’t see things in a broader view, I love you always, I hope you knew 🫡
Loving someone who is an addict is the hardest thing I will ever go through. Addiction took my dad at a younge age of 27. I made it to 31 about to be 32 this year and it breaks my heart I made it longer than him. I hope whoever is an addict can change their life around and know it's possible to get clean you just gotta want it for you!!! One day at a time friends. One day at a time.
Man we gotta get jelly rappin on this. His singing is beautiful in this song. But NOTHING is better than a jelly verse. Joyner is sick as fuck. I just need to hear these 2 rappin more.
I’m going threw this right now with my husband 9 years so hard to let go always say I swear I’m gonna stop now it’s sneaking lying and selling things I wish I could save him but you can’t change anyone who don’t want to change
I’ve cried to so many times. this song it just pours out
godamn it!!!!!!!!!!!!! yall had to maake this song............. i cant stop crying bruh................ FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Hearing the comeback from the addiction side brought me to tears on my knees. I’ve been there and remember feeling like there was no way out and no matter how much I wanted to stop using in my heart, I couldn’t put it down. Now my brother is fighting his battle and he’s so lost.
If Joyner doesn’t win a Grammy this year. There’s something wrong with the system. Dude just pushes out hits.  Fuckin love this song.
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how impressive every actor for a Joyner vid is, ensuring they lip sync his lyrics to perfection all while acting out the parts so in such a convincing way. It just goes to show how meaningful the messages are to even the actors that they make it a mission to portray the characters so vividly. 🙏🏽
This song deep 🙏
My daughter a drug addict, it’s already fried her brain. The voices in her head is driving her crazy now . ￼I had to walk away from her, the most heartbreaking thing to ever have to do as a parent. Me and my family really relate to this song thank you.
Its beautiful
The most painful experience of my life. Learning to let go of someone that is not healthy for me💔
Addiction is really hard. My sister and my cousin died in 2022 within months, and then my 88 year old grandma with dementia was released from this life just a month ago. My dad passed in 2009 too. I definitely have some survivor's guilt or something
I lost a friend from over dose of pills and alcohol years back but it still hurts til this day because I don’t have my friend who was like a brother to me
R.I.P Seni Smooth ....❤😢😢
🫡🌹
I will donate $0.50 to children in need foundation for every likes I get 🚁
I love this song so much!!  Goosebumps from head to toe 🔥🔥
Joyner has a different ... YHOOOOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!! Joyner is beyond talent, okay.
Wow I have never cried so much and I am work ........
This song was wayy to much for me.. I thought Save Me was deep.  This song is wayyy deeper....💔😭
I just wish my friend listen to me 😢
🤖♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🌞
Never give up on those who need light. Show them God through you and lead them to recovery.
I can’t suggest a solution the only thing I know for a fact is you can recover from the episode. It starts with realizing there absolutely IS a Higher Power who can Help the hopeless
Don’t take this the wrong way- I’m totally relating to this song. I thought I was hearing what’s going to be one of the greatest songs ever written and then the second verse or other side of the story came in. I can see how the artist wanted the juxtaposition but it isn’t necessary and the selfishness of the user is an excuse to stop listening. The songs about someone already fed up. It’s NOT a disease it’s a ailment of the Human condition.
This song is so powerful.....
How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  Yeah, I got somebody I love (yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (whoa) But I wrote this song in hopes when they'll hear it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it as much (whoa) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and makin' you feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (do what you might, whoa) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (lose it) And you in denial about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me  How can you love someone and learn to let them go?

Look, I know you been callin' for me (yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (uh) How do I let go of something I know is bigger and stronger than me?

If I could heart this a million times, I would. Hits too close to home.
This song speaks the truth!!
FYI- auto pitch correction is heavily used by this guy. So he is just your visual, you're  just listening to AI
This hits different, good s*** bro
This hits deep ❤️‍🩹
Extremely talented .love this
Before you ignore this, remember that your favorite artists all started somewhere. I think that most people have their ideas of a dream girlfriend/boyfriend, and when they think of them, they feel a certain way, see a certain person, hear certain sounds, weather, and can imagine certain colors. When I saw my dream girl, I imagined an empathetic girl that loved kids, Charlie Brown, and had a bit of an attitude. What is your dream person like? Hopefully when you listen to this track, it will make you think of them! This was recorded in Japan  🎎🗻 🎎🗻 This track is called "Schroeder and Lucy", https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrKu99BK4Y4 Please Listen 🙏
Only thing that could make this any better is a jelly verse
This reminds me of two of my friends I've lost due to fentanyl I hate it I miss the homies fentanyl has taken a lot of people and it must be stopped f*ck fentanyl
Deep
Just lost my dad in October to an addiction, this shit hits deep everytime.
Im always preaching i just love my people
You have literally done a song for the angel of the world the people who know wat lifes about and just try help no matter wat not yes men u have saved people
I literally am in this position.. I'm an alcoholic.. my ex finally left. I am ready to get healthy and move forward.. this song is everything to me right now.. we can recover

The song hit but the video makes it hit so different 😢 it’s a movie ❤❤❤❤
LOL SORRY FOR THUMBS DOWN ALL MUST HIGH LOL DEF THUMBS UP ,JELLY JOYNER GOODSONG   💯
Glad when I told you back then that you weren’t saying anything you making words rhymed . You listened . I can tell you listened to me All your music is content and has meaning you actually bring stuff to the table not just rhyming words.. but no scholding . Music is great Mass proud
When your terminal and after fighting for life was told I'm dead they pulled the ventilator after of all people my mom accidentally did after saying I'm disgrace to my family just because I'm a terminal United States Marine and exposure continues to effect me
Deep. 🔥. Story told

ive barely seen my brother in yhe last five months. saw him last night btried playing this. he didnt really pay attention. guess he isnt ready to c it yet… im gonna keep on him though
This is hitting me deep this morning I saw what number it was on the Billboard chart and I think it should be number one. The songs that are important hit number one. The real shxtt the stuff that matter it doesn't that's sad.
Thank you for sharing your god given talent with the world brother 🤝🏾🤝🏾🤝🏾
If it doesn't win any award at grammys, i will quit listening music for real.
It's good to see people coming together and supporting each other where they can
Found this through the canceled podcast 👌🏼
Although not drugs, my brother's an alcoholic beyond saving. You cannot save someone who does not want to be saved. It's sad to see him become more and more distant by the day.
I lost my sister to addiction a little over a year ago, and this is honestly the first song I've heard that truly expressed the pain that went along with that roller coaster.
Can’t stop listening
Sent this to my best friend whos my brother
✅💪🏾👏🏾🎯🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
🔥🌋🔥
This HARD 🔥 🔥 🔥
Best song joyner it makes us addicts wanna be better.
Thank You Joyner Lucas❤
Love how Joyner always doesn’t just put music into perspectives and show us through music but he DOESNT GET ENOUGH VIDEO CREDIT TO HE SHOWS US BOTHS SIDES VISUALS ALSO! Gifted keeps him safe god 🙏
I will do one sit up for every like I get on this comment
GOD DAMN THIS IS POWERFUL!
This is piece of eargasm
❤ everyone keep fighting
This song hit  different  I stopped and cried
Jelly Roll made this song perfect. Hats off brotha 💪🏿
Forget the big 3 Joyner is the big 1. Better than Kendrick, Cole and Drake. You deserve that spot. And not because I  am a Massachusetts native. Dorchester, Revere, Malden, Beachmont and many more. Been around.
He hands down has the best visuals to go with his songs
🎻🎻🎻
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ this is music 🎵 🔥🥲

Damn
Best song I have ever heard in my life ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢😢😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is one hell of a song. Joyner outdid himself on this one.
The best song ever 🎉
Been fighting with addiction on and off for most of my life, rehab helped me but it took me years to understand that I needed to be me and stop struggling to become what others expected me to be.  That verse  at @02:09 puts words to my struggle. thank you.
❤
God blessed you and saved you from dispare. Please show God appreciation by ending the vulgarity you and your beautiful wife Bunny spew in non musical videos and podcasts.  Don't be a hypocrite, be a respectful,  strong leader for  the people who enjoy your gift of music.
Man…..this song is beautiful, and absolutely to the point 😢
Need more of this, to reflect the real people ... heard it on the radio, didnt care who made it.. just knew i was a game changer: DMX, Xxx, Em level 🔥
Mtoto ANAUAAA kinoma NOMAA😂😂😂
Powerful 🙏🏾🖤🕊️
Struggling with addiction myself this song really hit home…thank you I needed to hear this!!! 💙
Lost my best friend to drugs on March 12, 2023. RIP Dustin Broyles. I love you brother and miss you everyday. This song spoke to me personally. Thank you Joyner and Jelly Roll. This song says exactly what we need to hear from both sides. Much love 🙏
Sheesh
For a addict like my self this song hits am almost at a year sober from meth and heroin
I love this n feel it in my soul
When you put shiny teeth in your face and Nike tennis shoes on is that supposed to make you a musician.
What they consider good music nowadays is hilarious this shows how stupid we have become a bunch of verbal masturbation with computer beats.
stay clean because you need too!
How did yall crawl up in my feelings like this?
So I just saw that this guy has a private jet and I had to come and see what is this guy all about.How in tf can you guys listen to him?! Music is wack af!
Praying for ur son ,God will lead
When dude in white shirt
damnnn my hairs went up
This songs lyrics are amazing . Makes me realize I may be to cold with my brother hope he knows I love him no matter what. I can't make his decisions or fate
Moreeeeeeee. We need more, cousin. Love this stuff
Do a push up now
day 1 I guess;)
Jelly roll with another banger
RIP my daughter, Jessica  1981-2023
This Shit Hit Home 😢 🔥
If this shit don't get a Grammy the industry is rigged, this song hit so hard for me it's actually crazy the goosebumps it gives, and the video, man joyners videos always be speaking volumes shit crazy he was just a lil ways down the Rd from me, shit fire bro your music heals souls bro, deff has mine, been in prison for 12 yrs drug addict for a few smoked by a car, and starting a new way for myself and your music gets me through my guy, stay blessed brother
I'm a big fan Taylor Swift isn't even my fan
I want Joyner and NF to do a song 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I listened to this about 100 times 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
This song made me cry 😢 All my recovery fam ❤Head up! struggling addict you got this get help .
Damn I can’t stop crying
Damn Joyner you literally had to live both sides of the bridge to write this I been fighting this demon for 18 years and the words that’s were spoken from both sides are exactly what you said thanks for another one you have know idea how this gets me threw
Songs hit different when you've been there 😢
Man, talking about keeping it a C Note
Damn bro you’ll hit a spot in me that really made me cry thank you for reminding me my priorities in life
This man Joyner is the next best of the best of J Cole but even better and deeper ❤❤in and it just makes me cry because this song just hit home for me man I gotta put this on repeat. My beats are thumping loud right now hella vibing rn im bout to roll sum and let this sink in and marinate for a bit
Jelly I have an older brother who has mental health issues and tells everyone he don't have a sister I stopped asking him to stay in my life yrs ago and he's an addict
Bruh two very talented men still innis bish doing they thang❤ I love it 😢❤
I'm a former coke addict, I got clean but my best friend from highschool fell into meth after we graduated. After nearly 6 years of struggling he relapsed and OD'd.   I hate the fact people call this a disease. It's not a disease. Saying it is gives us (addicts) an excuse. When your craving any reason to justify the problem is a good one.   I've been both sides addict, and friend to an addict. It's hell watching from the outside. And it's dark and confusing on the inside. This song does a great job of showing this. Thank you both, amazing all around. Stay blessed ❤❤
❤️
R those perks or norcos lMk?
Feels like you're talking to me
Nice song.
This one hit the hardest 🔥
Love Joyner. Always the best lyrics
This is art made to represent a loved one giving “tough love” bc the stress&hurt of loving someone in addiction is enough to make them believe staying away and loving them from a distance is the only answer 💔  And the other perspective is the addict, & how their identity becomes their addiction to those loved ones, & it’s always the main topic, along with getting clean if they want help & support… but if the addict isn’t ready to make that leap and get clean just yet… they receive that same “tough love” which hurts them.. so they feel they have to step away too, bc the stress of all that is too much to handle while in active addiction & only makes their guilt grow immensely..   Beautifully written,  Joyner.  🖤❤️‍🩹🤍  Also, addiction is a life long disease that does not discriminate.. always remember while loving an addict; do not let their identity become their addiction. Who they are while in active addiction is not them, they are so much more and we must remind them of that.❤
🥹🗣️
I love this a lot! Everyone needs to hear this❤️❤️
People who came from shorts😅 👇🏾
Wow this song is powerful to the fullest I just had a fall out with my bro and this kinda hits home for both of us
Sheesh that was tough
This song speaks VOLUMES. It puts into words so so much. This is what music should be, straight from the heart.
I honestly can say Joyner is theeeeeeeee best rapper of this time hands down and INDEPENDENT!
Wow this is deeeeeep
I really have no words this song is just so fire 🔥
If you’ve ever had problems with drugs you get this and it will give you chills because most have the hardest time trying to understand addiction and it ruins so many families!!!! Only the truest love survives!!!
This is powerful. I was in love with a drug addict. And I had to let go. I loved him but i had to say no 😢 he was 4 almost five years of my life. I finally realized at the end, he didn't love me. He loved himself and what I could offer him 💔
Never give up fight like hell because you never know one action can change someone’s whole life!! Trust me I know I’m only alive because a select few didn’t give up!!!
First song that’s made me feel something in while 😅
Omg this really hit hard. It seems like most of Jelly's songs do. I love how it's both parts. Thank you Yahweh for this second chance at life. I did fall down but in him I stand tall and strong.
This is what I needed 💙
LEGENDARY
GREAT
He talking bout his mom or dad.
Jeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy roooooooooooooollllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
@Joynerlucas the beast,,, this song will forever be the truth and anthem for most family, friends, relationships etc. Losing loved ones to drugs
This song just made me think of things I haven't thought of in a long time
This is great @joyner Lucas @jelly rolls
Very great song very good.  @Glad Joyner Lucas and jelly roll made this.  We can relate just on the outside.
Hes back story telling my life thatnk god!!!!
Half these comments lies for likes and comments the sheep fall for I love the song but hate hate the dummy’s in the comments
😂😂😂. What is this?
This song really does hit home for some. Jelly Roll is becoming such an amazing artist and is going to be really big one day. Joyner Lucas has always been a great real humble guy, and is an amazing song writer. He can tell a story from both sides, he’s one of the best for sure. They are great together!! I hope they make more music in the future together. Great job with this song, one of my favorites!
Rapper of the decade
Hopsin would have gone hard on this!!
Thank you for writing this song Joyner you are a real one!!!
All I want to say is thank the you Joyner and jelly roll. My mom was an addict and it was hard to see her go through what she went through. I saw her struggle and relapse so many times. And now she’s been sober for a year now. And this song hits something in my soul. So thank you.
comin from a rocovering addict been clean from herion for 8 years now , just know that theres a light at the end of the tunnel , gotta take the time and talk to yourself , when your ready YOU will make it happen , its tough no doubt but hard work and commitment will get yoiu threw thoes dark nights ! keep your head up you got this !!!
I havent cried this hard in a long time. Im the 2nd guy everyday...
18 months, sober life ain’t easy but it is better than living in my addiction and slowly killing myself. “Addiction is suicide on an installment plan”
I lost my family to addiction.. pills, heroin, and cocaine.. they’re still addicted after all these years. I am about to have my first kid.. I do nothing but pray they change.. this song really touched my heart. Thank you jelly roll and Joyner. I’ve listen to both of you since I was 10 and 11 lol.
My youngest daughter is addicted to drugs for last 3 years,your song made me cry like a baby,hopeless and helpless praying she'll get into rehab before it kills her. That's the reason I started listening to jelly, he keeps it real in his music.
Amazing song and message.
4 years sober and I was that dude alone with my demons shits a scary place to be.
Dude Jelly Rolls vocals keep getting better and better wow
Unfortunate that this song had to be made😢 real message with a timestamp of our current generation 💔 amazing artistry is the silver lining
Two Goats , God Bless anyone who needs to hear it. <3 you both as artists message is clear and the song bumps. Amen.
I wish addiction didn't take my dad & he could've heard this song,these words 4 me hit the nail on the head🤍🌊🤍
Either love me for who i am or leave me be
This song went real deep for me! Hearing  my perspective and then listening to the addict's perspective....a masterpiece of music😅! It's like this song was written for me and the addict that I love!
Two of the best story tellers through their music. The video's reality was perfection to the message of the music ❤️
Hell yeah
I agree, addiction is not a disease! Disease is a medical condition that a human doesn’t cause themselves and can be treated my medication. I was addicted in the past,  liquor as soon as I woke up until I passed back out.  Church and AA telling your your stuck that way for ever! It’s BS,  all your mindset and yourself being weak .  You have the power to over come weak addict and your weak mind .
Sheesh a banger ❤. Deep message too.
Yes Brother @jellyroll always a banger absolutely luv it!
🔥🔥🔥
I’m not crying, you’re crying
Killing it jelly roll love your music❤
Bro sounds like if jack black was a rapper and i'm here for it
🙌🏻💯🔥
Iam 10 years clean no Percy's sober no alcohol  to I did for my self an my children that's why I stop 😊😊😊
This is fucking great song.All love Joyner
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Ill never let go- momma to an addict.
My dad has been in and out of prison because of meth and I feel this so much, watching him change over the years, I can tell he really wanted to stop doing it and it doesn’t help he is bipolar and  I could tell he was really trying but it was just so hard to give him another chance after all these years and I feel responsible he’s in there again because I didn’t try hard enough to be closer with him
Cheese and rice!!!
Joyner an NF need to colab?  Think it would be WORLD changing!
Dave from Detroit I'm an alcoholic that song really made me cry make me think about a lot of stuff. Ain't nothing like jelly roll to make you really think.🙏
Am I the only person that couldn’t help but notice when the addict is giving his point of view (yes I know it’s Joyners voice) but it has like a nasally sound to it like his nose is stopped up from snorting something which makes it seem much more real (yes I’m a former addict. Opioids, meth & Subutek. Just couldn’t help but notice that little extra effort this man puts in to his delivery. JOYNER THE KING!!! #GARYTHEMAN
This song needs to be heard worldwide , now.
Blind fury would be the cherry on the top...last verse.....
6 months clean, after battling the last 8 years with a bottle, and pills.. while on the other side is my sister, who refuses to try. She's been using for the last 12-13 years.. she's lost so much from it, and it kills me to think of what's next... hearing this and understanding it from both sides is something truly incredible! This hits home a lot harder than I could've imagined. ❤
This hits different when you are a month clean yourself 🥺
This hits so much I love my brother to addiction we had such a good relationship before speak all the time and see each other no don’t feel like he around anymore 😢
Amazing
I’m 15 days sober this song hits hard my wife 3 years begging me to change finally she walked out can’t blame her addiction gets u and it’s hard to pull away from it I just wanna thank her she still hasn’t gave up on me  And I just want her to know I love her so much and my kids ❤ than you for the great music
I been clean for 5 days off boi this shit ain't no joke it's the devil frfr I been on some type of opiod since 2009. Suboxone for 6 year's which was a blessing but still a dependency. The government did this to us! They told us Percocets was this miracle drug with zero side effects they did this so they could come in to the inner cities and legally kidnapp our kid's. So these middle class white couples don't have to go to china or Africa to adopt they can get kids right here tht look just like them. This is a whole business. Look up Nancy Shaffer!! They killed her and her husband in their home because she was trying to expose the child trafficking and business for profit that IS CPS!! They let these Drs deal they're drugs turn poor single mothers into drug addicts then took that away and out they're work out on the streets herion aka boi. This shit is chess not checkers they know what they're doing! The "case worker s" NOT "social workers" are fresh outta school no kids no life experience never been hungry don't know anything about anything. It's disgusting!! My case worker was literally on probation and was convicted of DV had a no contact order with her own kids my attorneys had to withdraw my attorneys because this female had a case in the same department for her case!! This woman was in charge of me and mines!! I am a victim of domestic violence.... Tht alone is a conflict of interest! Not even going to get started on the Family court DA on my case who sat right next to my "case worker" was also the DA on her criminal case. 😂 Fucking joke!! The reason I was put on this earth is to expose them or at least start something that WILL!!! THEY ARE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY WITH TEARING OUR FAMILIES APART. I WILL NOT LET THIS HAPPEN ANYMORE!!
You are my favorite rapper. Thank you for these beautiful, meaningful works of art you give us. ❤
cringe
I relapsed a month ago and fucked 2yrs of hard work this just broke me down, i gotta get my head out my ass i was doing good and this shits not worth what im putting to risk.
This is beautiful  ❤❤
Two of the best artists painting such a beautiful picture. My little brother is my best friend, but he's been fighting alcoholism these last couple of years.  Joyner, you showed the other side of things and helped me with "I'm Sorry". This song helps me see where he might be coming from, just like the song you made for people like me gave insight to others.   This is really giving me insight on how we can battle this together. Mad love to Jelly Roll, mad love to Joyner. Generational talents. I'm praying for you guys. Keep moving forward fellas.
Lost 3 people in 3 weeks to overdoses. This touches so close to home. So teaching how we approach this situation. Thank you @joyner Lucas
i fucking love this song
Bullshit. It’s hard…30 grand a month. How the fuck?
This last year I went to summer camp twice for that powder.. I lost everything….im four months clean today and taking it day at a time….just wanted to comment because this shit goes hard &I appreciate it
I lost my big brother on July 31st 2023 due to overdose was my worst nightmare and then another big brother December 8th 2024 hit by a car and died from his injuries I’m still learning how to live without them they both had addictions but I never knew life was so hard on them wish I could have helped them more🥺🤞🏼❤️🕊️🕊️🥀🥀
Hey man I’m 10 months sober   He can do it by the grace of god.  The real battle for that person is in the mind if he finds that (why) again he will do great things. Gotta remember and remind yourself why you do what you do. If you do it for yourself you’re never gonna be happy. Find your why and you fly like never before. My why is my wife. That’s why I changed my life around. I never type messages on YouTube or any site. But your story hit me.  Tell your loved one he will be ok as long as he finds that why and never look back
Real is rare this is a masterpiece
If there ever was some poetry that gripped me whilst I'm going through addiction and depression this is it . It helps knowing that other people are going through the same test in life
You know you been through shit when you cry during this song, been crying for like 10 minutes. Stay away from drugs ❤
Damnnn, wow
Recently lost my friend because he overdosed in his room and no one knew, then you dropped this song so it hit me hard❤️
I’ve put off listening to this song. My bestfriend & me stopped talking cause of drugs. Idk if it was I did try hard enough or I just couldn’t help them. The next time I see her is in a coffin.. I happy for all the people who have beat their addiction. 💙💙
Time is the only way. But it never goes away
We all have demons. Face them or they’ll never leave. You got this. I’m learning every day the impact my choices had on my family. You can’t get time back. Keep going. 💙  Amazing song. Heard by chance on Sirius yesterday and it’s been on repeat since 💯🙌🏽
Ya
This song is so powerful
I will do me love you best scoot like of. Thuw red mix soft kit sory
1.5x sounds wayyy better. joyner still sux but ya know
You gotta do a remix and give Jelly a verse on this! Let him speak his truth to this heartfelt song ❤❤❤
My wife and I were both lost in addiction for so long and now we're directors of a non profit organization helping people out of addiction and developing a relationship with God ❤ this song has so much truth in it and it's a instant classic ❤
Joyner the GOAT
its insane how well the chorus of this song can apply to both perspectives. Joyner did good with this one!
Don't care what anybody says Joyner is one of like 3 artist ever who can do this.
🔥🔥💯💯💯😥😢
Addiction is is really hard I struggled with it for 10 years after losing both my parents at a young age and then my baby but I've been clean for 14 years now but everyday is a struggle
I just lost my cousin to drug addiction four months ago and my aunt died 6 six years from an overdose my mom was a addict for seventeen years and is now four years clean jellyroll has had a big impact on her life
Its been 8 years since my sister became addicted to meth. I still try to manifest a future where shes clean, she knows her worth, and things change.
Going through the same been fight my demons and my finances demons both the same addiction plus I got a extra one so helps me think
Hearts and prayers for those dealing with addiction. And the many lives and talents loss. But we all have addictions that need to be addressed. Thanks to those that took the time to post a positive song cause it's helped me so now I can help someone else.
This song is a modern day Michael Jackson's Man in the mirror. I listen and I hear self reflection and I tell myself. The only enemy is the inner me that's spent too much time worried about what others think. When I simply needed to learn to love myself.
Omg this is a banger
Im sober for 4 years and have a child with an addict. Please pray for us. Its getting worse everyday.
Great song - dont understand why they added auto-tune to Jelly Roll's voice though.
I listened to this because I love JellyRoll and listening to the whole thing I loved all of it. Addiction breaks all boundaries, race, generational & more. I’m 60& it took me 5 stints in rehab but I’m 9 years clean now…. Came close , too close, too many times 🫂
This song makes me ugly cry every time I hear it, my partner was a heroine addict and I found out the hard way. He did a bid and came out of prison sober, I thank God everyday that he’s becoming the man he was destined to be. Prison saved his life and I will be forever grateful.
Errrrbody luh' Jelly Roll!
Yeah the Real Joyner is back🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this song hits so close to home it’s crazy. ❤️❤️
Such a great song
❤
As someone who struggled with addiction, this song hits so deep. ❤
Get Marshall Mathers on a remix please omg. I love this song so much. Thank you
My wife has a gambling addiction... it was completely torn our family apart.
Great songwriting, man…😢
I have an a problem my self and yes someone needs help ever since the 🌙 left its like the only thing that helps i hate that i have ruined #us 😢 she was my help and i was blinded by the needle and has my mental all fucked up plz my ❤ i need ur help i dont wanna do this with out u ur my rock i need something solid
Thank u for this song. Ive been going thru so much this yr and ive been doing bad stuff that i told myself i never would bc i grew up around that and didnt wanna be like that. This made me realize i need help before it gets out of control. Please dont judge me as we all go thru things in life. Sending love to all who need it ❤❤
Killed It!
This song hurts the hearts of those who dont have the strenghth or resources to get clean...esoecually the closet. Users whove been secretly killing themselves for years thinking "my addiction isnt as bad as everyone elses...i dont steal or lie for my habit and have it under control...nobody even knows"....except someone does...yourself .....but no resources to help with the battle so they keep on trucking ...thinking they are not hurting anyone but themsleves .....right ....
Omg this song is everything for people who have loved ones with addiction. I heard this song yesterday for the first and just cried thinking about my brothers. Really good song love the passion you all put into this hit ❤
Beat my methamphetamine addiction coming up on 1 year sober
I think it's a true story and I love it. And it's so good
Lost my father jan 13 from fent. I never even knew him but i was responsible for everything afterwards. Its painful. He was never there for me and i had to be a big girl and take of him after he already left 😢
This the best song on addiction I have ever heard. I have 7 years of sobriety. It took 11-17 years in prison to change. Although I’m not there anymore I’ve been In both perspectives in this song!! I relate on every level!! Beautiful masterpiece!!!
I’m a year and 6 months clean from shooting heroin was addicted to it for 12 years and I’m very grateful to be alive I know it’s hard but trust me got to let go and let god
Damn 🔥
Damn.... this one.
7 months sober, thank you
21 days clean off China white and xannies and not letting go of this peace!!!! ❤
Lost my sister from addiction. This song hits ❤
It's High Time Joyner Did A Project With Kendrick
Facts! I'm an alcoholic. And they want me to say "I'm an alcohol user." For empathy. I don't need empathy, I needed fuckin help.
Needed to hear this. Trying to fix myself
This song hit the heart growing up my mom was addicted to coke it was hard to deal with as a child /young man,
❤
This a love letter to chris brown or nah?
Just lost my fiancée a month ago funeral was a week ago this shit hurts so bad never had this feeling addiction kills an I aided in that giving her money and I was smoking weed with her while she popped her pills smfh dam thanks jorner an jelly roll
I really wish my brother could have heard this song it might have saved him I miss him so much everyday he overdosed on fentanyl I wasn't raised by my mom but my siblings that were raised by my mom are all on drugs my sister just had a baby and the baby is in the neonatal intensive care because she is addicted to fentanyl please if you're struggling get help do anything you can fight you're important to somebody
Joyner you talented mothafucka!!!! Got damnnnnnnn 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤
Fucking love this
Charles Daniel Cochran   I wish you were here, and not out doing yo thang pops
Motherfuck the big 3 its just big joyner!!!!!!!!!
Reading these comments my eyes got watery I’m happy to see you folks over came something that almost took your life away and had a family member who over came it also stay strong y’all 💪🏾🫶🏾
Unexpected collab!
Esta canción me hizo llorar y reflexionar todo el daño que les hago con mi alcoholismo y la verdad quiero cambiar antes de que sea tarde. Solo le quiero dar paz y satisfacción a los que aunque ya no hable. Se que ahí siguen para mi. Los quiero
I feel like a failure for not being able to help my cousin with his addictions, I care for you man but its hard when you don't wana help yourself I tried to speak to you the way one should have been spoken too, you took advantage of my kindness, made me angry and now i pray you find yourself and come ask me for help, ill always be there for you.
Who doesn't love JELLY ROLL💙
the duo nobody knew we needed
Clean 3 years i Lost everything i loved besides family my dog my girl my personal items almost lost my freedom and life several times. I thank God everyday and pray he'll continue to help me be the best man i can be stay sober and focus on whats important family.
Lost my best friend to addiction 17 years ago. She would have been 32 this year.
It's so crazy & unfortunate how many of us relate to this song. It speaks volumes to where we're at as a society and how massive this problem really is. It's the real pandemic.. I hope everybody struggling out here finds their path and leads a good life. Godspeed 🙏🤟
My dad picked alcohol over me every day of his life til the day I turned 18 and left and still to this day. I truly HAVE learned to love him from afar and let go of hope…
Joyner's videos hit different
11:28AM//4-4-24
Damn this is deeper than Stan by Eminem
This reminds me of my little sister I pray she gets sober to meet my babies
I lost my brother at a very young age over drugs ..this song really hit me hard ...
I said how p with big nuts
Hog with big nuts
shit hit the soul
Freaking love this and God bless everyone and anybody that is in a battle with addiction I promise u there is help I hope this comment finds u all and God bless America
This song right here is going to be number one for along time
God bless the both of you
Wow
Awesomeeeeeee
My Favorite Artist/Producer
The fact that I relate to the addict's verse 😢
This song is so good been on repeat since it came out😂
Love this song! My son sent it to me!
Been listening to you for a while since you re did Chris breezy album so it’s been a while first heard of you from the I’m not racist and yours songs have had an impact on me I’m in a fight right now trying to get back to find myself and your music helps so many people out there rn shit🤜🏾✅
And what do you say to the addict that justifies his using. His "chemical imbalance".... I either go with it and watch the amount he uses, or say no and lose him all together, his daughters lose him all together ...
BEST OF THE BEST OF THE BEST! New school raised by oldschool! Top OG
You know what Jelly Roll just earned my respect and Joyner killing it !!
Sorry mom
I had to say goodbye to my best friend  due to these dam drugs
Being on both sides of the situation, I’ve never related more to a song in my fkn life! Thank you Joyner and Jelly! Y’all both make real relatable music with real stories, Thank You 🙏🏽 we just get words that might rhyme and mumble rap these days. Not many out there still telling REAL stories in their music and relating the “we the people”!
I miss you big bro..... Come home... We can fix all your struggles. We can get you a bike and we can both just ride off and get lost together til we find ourselves again. #StillNotGivingUpOnYou
This needs to win all awards of the year, this is to many people's lives, and it brings awarness to addiction which there isn't enough off, we need more then don't do drugs and drugs are bad. ugh
I got 6 months and 12 days  clean and sober after my last fatal over dose  God is good
This really hit home. Last year, January 6th I lost my cousin.Who I love to death?He gave a friend a ride a hour away.His friend said he'll give him twenty dollars and study game on a bag which included Fentanyl. When he got home he gave me a call and said hey my buddy gave me a bag instead of the twenty bucks. Told him that sounded very sketchy. Told him if he sold it to someone. He would either go to jail. And if he took it himself he'll take away from his son, which is 6 years old.He will never be there for graduation or his wedding date.One week later we found him dead. This song is so sad but we need awareness and leaders like jelly roll. Bro I seen you talking to the senate.That shit was amazing. This drug is killing our youth. What type of hustler kills his own client?How do you make money off of that. And how do you live with that. Back in the day when we were hustling, there wasn't none of this b.S. They even have it in the weed.Is your weed that trash that you have to add a additive. I love you guys.I don't say this the other men I don't know your but your work speaks volume. My cousin went to see joyner lucas In new hampshire back in the day when he just popped up. Always was a big fan of yours Joey Afzaal. Aka ❤  Gorilla Tactics R.i.p Thanks again for making this song.This one really touched me. ❤❤❤😊   Keep killing the game guys. True legends. Salute. .. He still has a picture of you on his Facebook.Just look his name up.And we dope to see a message up there by you.His son's name is Ace. That would be legendary if you gave both of them a shot out 12 of you guys.But i'm gonna go out like a G. He was deep into his music wanted to be a rapper.
Hits so close to home for me. 😢❤
🦍💯

Im 6 years clean from meth 8 years pain pills I finally got my family back not only you who suffers but your family does too ❤❤❤
I really love this video I was addicted to heroin and cocaine and alcohol I know it's not easy I had to give it to God in Jesus Christ I had to surrender addiction is a brain disease I'm learning about it and I'm taking it one day at a time 😢😅😢🙏🏾
This song hit me to the core, I havnt been able to tear up in a while.
It’s every parent’s night mare to see their child on drugs. My son has been clean for 6months. Im sure everyday is a challenge for him to stay on the right path but I believe in him and I know he can push through this madness.
The combination we didn’t know we needed. What a song
Did this not illegal... To make this. Can't you hear Origin of Voicals the actual. And do this to people who wanted earn it. Instead of them taking your voice for fam. BUT YOU YOUR IDENTITY SOld THEIR SOUl To be You. People will die without these vocals not being able to Project pain on a poetic level
Hard 💪
Its not easy to walk away from someone you love , its one of the hardest things you will do , i hope you never be in this position. If you do just be strong , know your heart will hurt more if you stay and watch. When or if the time ever comes and they hold out there hand for help take it and help but dont facilitate there addiction.
To everyone in the w🌎rld today prescription drugs like fentanly R exactly like the street drug heroin.
I'm 4 years Clean from drugs and alcohol and finding help was the best decision I've ever made.
Please make this open verse
Wow, I know what he's saying, but I can't help but be reminded of the man I used to be, the man I killed, and had to learn to be me all over again, because I didn't even know who I was

This touch home😢😢😢😢❤❤😢😢😢😣😣😣😣😓😓😓😓
Everyone in my family battles with addiction. This hits so hard Joyner. I'm crying so much right now bro.
❤
I lost my mom to an overdose almost 4 years ago now and this song has me in tears
im 48 and i have lost all my high school friends to drugs this brought back some pain.
I just got realised from prison, I don't know what really to say I'm lost , I miss people I love I'm scared I won't know what love is again I'm an addict and scared I'm sorry I just listening to this 4am where I am UK and fed up man
I need to send this to my mother
I hope that the day that jelly and Eminem finally collaborate, that my man gets a chance to spit a verse too. But this is still great, it's amazing the impact jelly roll has had on this world lately
😭
You done it again😢
This is why we love music.
I cry every single time I hear this. (I listen everyday and downloaded it) The struggle is so real. Truth Hurts so bad! Then feeling like you need it is a scary reality.  Stay Strong Everyone and if not keep moving forward
😭
this song  will be legendary one of those that  will be heard forever
This song is so beautiful and sad at the same time!!
Joyner you did your big one with this joint right here🙌🏽🤎🙏🏽🥰🔥🔥🔥
Simple lil acts of love like this can and will save a life sometimes. Love your family and children that are caught up in the war of drugs. They need the support and help. Yes it’s a battle sometimes but don’t give up🥰🙏🏽🙏🏽😳🤎🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
thank you bro......Hip Hop is alive ...thank you I mean it
🥀🌻
Thank you for being our voices. "They" didn't listen before, but because y'all are speaking for us, we're being heard. You guys are amazing!! Thank you again.
The actor in the video killed his role!! What a great song and video!!
Speaking openly to anyone who reads this... I'm 22 and I've recently developed a drinking habit. I know it may not be drugs, but it is still so impactful. I've had a lot happen recently and I never would've thought I'd ever get addicted to drinking, genuinely ever. But this song— having both perspectives. It feels like a guide or a sign for me. I feel so at war with myself with guilt, feeling terrified of what other people think of me because of my drinking, alongside another part of me that is just trying to stay above water. To anyone drinks or drugs, know that my heart is with you. I'm a young person that you'd never think would fall into it. You're not a demon or evil, people love you.
Song had me in tears I lost my sister and also have been on both side this shit hits home thanks Joyner needed to hear that!❤🫶🏼💯
Most definitely they work together again.
Very cool to see these two together making a hit 🎯💯  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
As a little brother of an addict this first verse hits so hard. The second hits even harder. The most difficult thing in the world is to love a cactus. You love them so you hold on tight, but the cactus only cuts you. The most difficult thing I’ve ever had to do was walk away. I just can’t  do it anymore.
Ah-mazing and so powerful!  This song is the real deal and expresses so much my kids and I have felt . ❤🙏
this song made me cry the first time i heard it, drugs took both my parents from me and i haven’t talked to them in years and just been feeling alone so much and this song made me think of them, it sucks because it’s not really them on drugs. everyone that has an addiction please reach out to someone u won’t regret it
Hope you keeping up with the likes looks like you got a lot of push ups to do 😂😂
It doesn’t get any doper then the hotline number at the end for all mass area that’s soooooo fucking dope brother
I’m proud to say I’ve been two years clean off cocaine but if I wasn’t I’m sure this song would of been sent to me from someone I hold close to my heart
Man this is it...🎉
My daughter just sent this to me and I am bawling. My nephew is an addict & its affecting our entire family. I pray each day, (today will be the day he stops)😢 Sending him this to him now!!!
I lost my girlfriend to addiction to start this year off. When I first heard this song it cut so deep. The feeling I got from the 1st listen of that second verse broke me down  to tears. I love these two artist. Joyner you are top tier, your story telling is 2nd to none. Keep it coming, and thank you!
Man this song is FIRRREEEEE  ..Id love to see more of these 2 collaborate!!!Jelly's voice is AMAZINGGG!!I SEE MORE AWARDS COMING IN HIS FUTURE EVEN JOYNER WILL HAVE A BRIGHT FUTURE!!KEEP IT UP MAN THIS IS 100%FIRE!!
I love this song💜🩵💚💛❤️💓💙🧡💕💗🩷❤️‍🔥💞
I just lost custody of my 7 year old twin girls after battling DCYF. I have lost 3 kids to the state WTF due to my mental illness and homeless I finally get stable housing and I'm told to late so next best thing open adoption. What do I do now I had a partial hysterectomy since I'm transitioning 😭😭😭😭
Damn. This hit hard.
Probably Top 5 realest songs that ive ever heard &&& I 125% relate too this shit..... SMFH !  Addiction is moutha' fucka' son &&& ever last revolving door, until *"YOU"* decide enough is enough.... Nobody else ! AMEN ! ✝️🛐👑💯🖤🤞🏽🙏🏽✡️🏴7️⃣🔹4️⃣🔹1️⃣4️⃣
First time hearing Jelly roll this dude can sing damn! Didn’t know he sounded like that
when you catch tons of goosebumps - you know it's a Joyner classic...just wow.
My buddy died of a bad bag about 5 years ago I hugged him the night he passed and it still hurts to this day, the facts he smiled and told me to hit him up later, I know the person that gave them the bag and justice was done but at the end of the day heads were turned and the person who died didn’t receive legal justice but it was also his decision. I miss you to death Coty and anyone who has had to deal with this they are sorry I just want you to know that they love you and didn’t mean for any of this to happen.
Great to see Joyner making numbers again🔥🔥
This got me balling 😭
This song needs more views and likes this shit hits hard
This song hits deep
Really hit home 💔
This is too deep brothers
I sent this to my sofa. Now it’s a whole couch!
I sent this to my ex struggling with addiction this week yesterday he sadly caught drugs charges and went to jail
This song hugs your soul
I needed this man. Thank you my guy. Drugs isn't my problem, but the lyrics can be translated and I have been doing that with your music since Ross Capicchioni. You're the best dude. I hope you see this, keep going strong with your music, you're the greatest there is today. The best story teller in the US. The UK has your back too bro
I went through this situation with my mom and my the moyher of my youngest child it really used to upset me more then anything cause everything Joyner said in thia song is exactly how I felt but I understand it now im 31 years old my mom has been clean since I was 2 years old and my youngest son mon has been clean for almost 2 years now THANK YOU JOYNER LUCAS for this song man I cried a little while watching thia video GOD is good and anyone who is dealing with this or knows anybody dealing with this I hopefully this will help u 🙏🏾
I know this song is going to blow up! It resonates with so many people❤️ that’s what music is all about. Touching the soul & connecting each other no matter all the differences, we all come together with one similarity.
I cried the first time I heard this song and it brings tears to my eyes every time I'm 3years clean when my gma passed it was 2years and that's all she ever wanted and I'm so happy I was able to give her that and make her proud 😢
Best song ever  ❤️ you and jelly roll come together great
I love this song. It's the truth of how being addicted to drugs
This shit hit hard
💪🏾this real gng keep going 🔥🔥🔥
Keeping clean this song hits deep…
Generational song right here!
Jelly Roll is fire no matter what song he gets on
One of  my closest friend had to have his heart valve replaced due to drugs, and he still decided to use. He’s now in prison for a 2nd time. Hes really a great person underneath all the demons, I hope he finds his peace again
I don't talk to my brother and sister anymore. They are addicted to lying and I am addicted to anger.
Why do i feel like hes talking about eminem?😮
Someone call the fire department this is fire!!!!
lately I feel like you are into me, you have been rapping about how I exactly feel, Dude! you are the one and only my all time favourite Rapper!
lately I feel like you are into me, you have been rapping about how I exactly feel, Dude! you are the one and only my all time favourite Rapper!
My fav artist in the world, Joyner, thank you for all you do, you something truly special, strong message. God bless you and all the broken people
All these new rappers comming out sounding like previous ones. He rap great but I thought he was Kendrick
(⁠●⁠♡⁠∀⁠♡⁠)
So many people saying their addicts or family/friends of addicts and I’m praying for all of you as a wife of a recovering fentanyl addict! Life is never easy, but I pray those lost souls come home. 💚🙏
Joyner always hits hard and the message is deep. One of the best at what he does!
It’s getting a lil misty in here Damn this hit hard. Living in  Baltimore I can relate all too well.🖤💪🏽
two months clean, just for today. "If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believing in you"
This guy is not country.
Accountability solves this.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn this song hits hard ❤❤❤
In 1 month I’ve been on Crystal for 2 years. Not exactly the milestone I ever expected to collect when I first started playing around with it. Binged for 2 weeks straight, sleeping minimal hours each day, barely eating, I was depressed so I felt amazing in the beginning, but it took ahold of me right away, despite all of that I’ve convinced myself its what makes me happy somehow. Longest time without it in these almost 2 years is 7-8 days. Usually it’s just a couple day break before I’m so miserable I need more to feel normal, and then the binge begins all over again. I want out. Losing the little family I created burns more than some Crystal into the nostril ever could. I’m chasing the high, but really I’m running from that pain of what I lost that I was never able to overcome. I hope we all find the help we need, and for those who don’t find the help, I hope you find the peace you’re searching for.
May we never fall apart
Yeah, I got somebody I love (Yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (Damn) , That line
My mother been on heroin for 4 years now and it’s killing her and I don’t know how to explain to her how I feel and it’s killing me seeing my mother with cancer doing an awful drug that’s killing her and I wanna send this song to her but I have no way of getting in touch with her haven’t seen her in a while, I just hope she’s doing okay maybe one day she’ll realize
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💪🏾
this song is amazing and a lyrical inspiration, I imagine it as an internal monologue between the addict struggling with the slimmer of himself within
For each and every one of you that have battled the addiction beast and won, you are amazing!!!! So many did not and are not. To those that are still battling you are amazing too and stronger than you know. NEVER give up! You have so many people rooting for you and waiting for you to reach out your hand to help pull you out of the beasts grip. You also have a God that is more powerful than any beast with his arms outstretched to you. Grab hold and don't let go because HE never will!!!!!
I didn't sleep when my daughters heroine addiction was in full rage. By the grace of God and a will to live and a soul that loves, she has now been clean for almost a full year. The hardest thing I have ever had to do was watch my beautiful child like that. She almost killed me during the worst part by attacking me. Never give up hope. Sometimes it is all you have. I love her beyond measure and I  am so proud of her and thankful for a Father that always loves us.  She has been to hell and fought the beast and won!!! She is amazing !
I swear there ain’t no better than my fav🫡💯 Joyner Lucas, you definitely deserve it all, he is my fav 💯
👏👏👏
You don't know better!! You're trying to fix your own car instead of taking it to a mechanic. 👑
I love you Joyner, thank you ♥️🇧🇼🇧🇼
Listening to Joyner brings the 1st 3 letters of his name into my life. ❤
🙏🖤💯🔥
My sister is lost and this song found me so vulnerable in our space
GOD WHY ME!!!😭🙏🏽💔❤️‍🩹🫥IM SORRY FOR BEING ME
Jellyroll u touch my heart and soul
Damn.......just realized Joyners talking to me......🤦🏾‍♂️fuck
Wow that shit is deep. Love the two perspectives sad. Hit me right in the feel.
Amen may God help us through our struggles each and every day
Hey damnie i geuss we never fell apart if you were never there ryte danielle
Listening to this song for the 1st time on the birthday of my brother who lost his battle with addiction. He got 30 short years. 💔 He should've been 32 today. I'm praying for everyone struggling and proud of everyone who's fighting every day to stay sober.
#LLG🕊️ lost my sister 3/4/24, to an overdose. I live in active addiction. Fighting it everyday, while I live with my loss. And it's the hardest thing I've ever dealt with after losing my grandparents... I love you GG. Til infinity 💚
This came at the perfect time ❤
CaseOh got Vocals.
Gd
Ucansing brother
OMG TEARS 😭😭😭😭 I KNOW THAT FIGHT AND STRUGGLE ALL TO WELL AND @JellyRoll MADE MY ROAD MUCH EASIER TO TRAVEL❤❤thank you for another power message
Love of my life was the secret addict it hurt so much 25 years and I didn't even know her 😔🥀
30 seconds clean, skittles hits hard, wish me luck... 😂
I LOVE THIS TYPE'S OF AD'S ❤
the best thing is Faith in God 🙌🏻✝️🔥💖
❤
Sober 8 years I did it for my self never felt better
pushing 2 months till 11 years clean. never thought it would get this tough to stay there but you have to. cant backslide
Damn jelly  spreading your wings!!
Joyner Lucas This Song So strong  This Broke Me Down .Thank You for dropping this song This song shall touch a lot of people I'm sure as it did me exactly what I'm going through with somebody I love but we cannot understand each other at the moment smh it hurts.. This song and lyrics took the words right out of my mouth Thank you for putting great music out I appreciate you ✊✊💯💯✊✊💯💯✊✊💯💯 Your music is inspiring
Everytime I hear this song makes me break down. Have someone breaking themself due to this. He’s family my brother my cousin and it just kills me. He’s always been my partner in crime. Hope something clicks and be over powers it not ready to say goodbye anytime soon :(
This song came out a few months to late. My buddy just gave up his life addiction. He has 3 Youngs boys and I'll never understand why he gave that up. I miss him everyday best riding buddy I ever had. 😢
😞
🔥 ❤
4 yrs clean🙏💪💪💪❤
If its not a disease why has it gotten to me?
I showed this to my sister who just came out of the shit and watching her break down to this shows it got through her. That’s why Joyner’s music always will hit home cause it always reflects with what people go through on a daily basis but it always shows two sides of the story’s. This is what we truly needed for someone to not promote the drugs but to show the damage it does to family and loved ones! 😢
FEEL the REAL.
Been listening to JellyRoll for 2 Years now ❤
I’m working on my addiction as we speak and it’s the worst thing ever the hurt is always there. But god has e better plan for us all
Amazing song from both perspectives! The actor playing that 2nd verse did it justice 👌
This shit just made me cry 😢😢😢 just trying so hard to change and stop
As an addict in recovery I also have a son who is an addict what's in your child killed himself every day is the most horrible thing you will ever go through as a parent to those are you struggling with addiction into those parents who have addicted children I pray for you and your children every day You are not alone
My best friend lost his fight Saturday 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 the only person to love me unconditionally 😭😭😭
Joyner=best rap artist out for years. First album til now
This song helps me. Just thank god everyday I’m alive and still able to write music.
Powerful
This song couldn't have dropped at a better time for me!!
As a 28 year old daughter of parents still addicted to drugs... I hope you find the strength one day to get clean for your children 🙏🏻❤ I pray for you and for them, amen.
jelly is on a roll damm
I love this song
This song has been on replay for days 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I missed this Joyner
Dealing wit this in real is crazy
POWERFUL WORDS ARE
I lost my only daughter to a fentanyl overdose in 2018, she was 29 😢💔🙏
All this Big 3 talk while this man's changing lives... 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Damn this shit hits heavy my ex wife is struggling with addiction and we have 2 kids together so I've been doing the parenting for the past 6 yrs and it been so hard to see her going through this shit and watching my kids suffer for her battles.But I've been trying to stay strong for them and her even though we won't be together again I still love her.This jam says it all bro 💯💯 Feeling into words this shit is powerful Brody 💯💯💯
2 years clean off all substances after 12 year battle! Everyone thinks addicts are so weak but I think recovering addicts are some of the most strongest people I have met. The ones that say we are weak are the ones who have never went through it and most wouldn’t last a week in the lives we lived to survive. WE ARE STRONG AND RESILIENT! And once we finally break free we become unstoppable!! Congrats to everyone in recovery! I’m proud of you! God bless you all ❤
Addiction is hard my people really. And yea you can overcome it but in sum situations won't let that happen and for I say I respect all walks of people struggling because of this cause that person thinks about it everyday how it's fucking their people up and them and they can't be anything
In my 31 years here on earth I have never came across a song that every word matched my life ❤ thank you!!
Thank you Thank you Thank you for putting out this song I sent it to my Son who I haven't seen in five years that's fighting an addiction. ❤
I'll be 7 yrs sober this summer 🙏 you can do it 🫶🫶🫶
I’ve been sober for almost 3 years. Your music helped me more than you know. I saw Jelly Roll in concert last year and I kid you not I’ve seen over 200 concerts and yours was the first one I have ever cried at.   In 2021 I was listening to your music while I was out on a delivery and I came across this young woman who I thought at first was standing on a bridge that goes over a major highway just watching traffic but I soon realized she was on the other side of the guard rail looking for a moment to jump. I’ve never ripped my e-break so quickly in my whole life. I literally left my car in the middle of the road and I ran and put my arms around her and said “it’s not worth it”. I was able to convince her to come back over the railing to safety. If I hadn’t become sober I don’t think I would have even saw her so thank you for helping me become sober and helping me save someone’s life.
Just lost my little sister July 1st 2023. (18 years old)Never thought she would lose her life to addiction and the part where Joyner said “a fellow can’t even have a conversation without you trying to preach”. I sooo felt that because I really tried my best to come up with other topics but it was just SO hard. I helped putting her into rehab and 2 weeks later she ran away and found what she wanted, the same day…..took her last breath in some random dudes bathroom all alone. 😔
Child of 2 addicts, and I’m in tears. Thank you..
Lost my big brother on November 25th, 2023. His 34th birthday is in 14 days.... he loved jelly roll 💚⚘️
Lost 2 my sister's to fentanyl an a son who over came addiction. Feel this song for sure 😢
I will set intention for it to this time
I’m underground rapper ain’t even stream very picky about these suck rappers but been following since the remixes n this shit hits home💯🤌🏾🙏🏾💔📈
This shit is on fire. Big up Brother🙏✊
Reading the comments makes me feel like I shouldn't be in the position I'm in. Addiction is ruining my life right now but I'm sure others have overcome much worse.
I’m in the mood with this song 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Well that was depressing
I've been clean from heroin for 3 years but it was too late. I passed it onto my son. It's amazing how genetics work. I never used in front of him but thought it was best to be honest once I was sober. Turns out he'd been using heavy drugs for years once he lived with his dad. He's only 19 but I don't think he'll make it to 21. He's in a very very bad way.  Got him into a clinic, then rehab and he left. Now it's been a month of silence. I've lost 20 pounds this month from heartache. It's so much worse than dealing with my own addiction. My daughter took the opposite route and is anti everything. I pray she stays this way. To all you other parents not sleeping over worrying for your lost kids, I understand and I'm so sorry.
😔🙂👍
Call your family!!!!!!!!
I love and appreciate every one of yal. Thank you
🔥🔥
This is that real shit… you and jelly did not disappoint brother this song is hard asf ♥️💪
41 days clean smh this song is a blessing cause I still have urges but this song empowered me to stay clean I been incarcerated since I was 17 I'm now 40 drugs I've been dependent on for so long to make it thru my days but no more it's time to love on me I want to live and not die tired of running people away tired of the same old things it's time to make a change with in me my way of thinking my life thank you guys for this one needed it this the one the game been missing 🫂💯🙏🙏
My dad died from an overdose this hit so hard
❤❤❤this shit go hard!!
Me and my friends have lost some one we trusted and cared for a lot but he didn't listen and I haven't heard from him in a bit so I don't know how his is doing but from what I hear he is still on drugs cause he got me started and quit, it was hard but I did it and that's what I tried telling him
I lost my cousin Ashley /sister to a heroin overdose turns out it was laced With fentanyl and methamphetamine and this song brings back everything good and bad but she was always the first person I called when something good or bad happened 💯❤️‍🩹🤦
I wish I could have played this song for you before you passed Dave, I miss you like crazy man we caused a lot of destruction in our own lives but the things you said to me and wisdom you spoke into me when we were getting high off that dumb shit still speaks to me on a lot of levels you were just a broken man just trying to shed his pain without knowing the harm you caused around you to the ones who only wanted to help and love you. Finally got myself out of that stuff but it was too late for you man, I miss you and think about you all the time bro hope your smiling down on me this song reminds me of you to a T till we meet again
This is beautiful. Something is happening right now, there’s a shift. You can feel it.   If Today You Hear Gods Voice, Harden Not Your Heart.
Almost 6 years ❤ sep 26 18 people can change I have built an amazing life for my babies and I we have a home a life a family security a safe place and best of all they know they can always depend on me and I will never let them go again! They trust me again ❤❤❤

The only YouTube commercial I ever clicked on
🙌🙌🙌❤🙌🙌🙌
5 years clean. Lost 90% of those who meant something to me to drugs. The problem was so bad back home that they have a whole field filled with crosses for those who od'd. Feels like a high-school reunion when I go there. R.I.P to those not here today.
Great❤
Clean for 5 months. It takes a lot of strength to beat addiction and a lot of these kids today don’t understand the dangers
Praying for anyone and everyone going through an addiction. I’ve lost so many friends…. Never give up❤
10 days sober for alcohol today 🙏🏻
Stay strong never give up ❤❤❤💪🏾💪🏾
Loved it so much ❤❤❤
This is incredibly well done. Unexpectedly crying on my couch. Thank you for sharing your gifts with the world. ❤
R. I h Jewel aka Mama 😢
15 years clean and never looking back ❤❤ 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾for anybody reading this, I love you and you can do this. Everyday forward brings you farther out the dark... 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️Keep going!!!!
Is it just me or does this sound like it should be in a James Bond movie. The big dance scene right before it cuts to James Bond scoring the hottest chick in the movie?
I lost my best friend to addiction. I wish he was alive today to hear this song.
dope. real shyt. more peeps need to hear your music
🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊😤
This is without any question a Genius!  Love it the same way i Love the song I'm no Racist. Never Quit this Style! Love❤
This video makes me sob. My husband of 3 years and father to my son was an addict, it got to the point it was no longer safe for me and my son so I was leaving him. During our divorce process he contacted me from rehab. I picked him up from rehab when he got out and he stayed with me. Our divorce was final one week later, the next morning I found him overdosed in my floor. Addiction is so hard for everyone involved.
How has this got less than 5 million views!!!! Absoloute instant classic
Best song For Me in the whole album
My whole life i fought with my mom about her addiction last year i found out my girl and i were having a baby and I told her if she doesn’t stop with all the bs she won’t be in her life and she has come so far
Jellyroll is a bit of hype yo, but this track fire.
Im an Addict in Recovery, 81 days CLEAN Tødãy! I Absolutely LØVE THIS SONG! THANK YOU ❤🙏🏻💪🏼
Great song! Nobody wants to be an addict. I know this because I don't want to be one. Some people will never understand what we go through.
💎angelic intro💎
Joyner is definitely one of my favorite artist out now.
I read so many people commenting how people relate. Im so grateful that i can not relate and enjoy it as a good song instead
Lost my little brother to fentanyl almost a year ago now, this song hits hard. I'm sober now, I just wish it didn't take losing him to make it happen. Thanks for this song.
I just lost my mom to addiction a few days ago. This hits hard
Joyner Lucas is an inspiration! I love this bro. Thanks for your music. Respect from Chicago!
Did jelly roll forget how to rap? That singing didn't sound too good
I'm trying to finish getting clean. I kept relapsing with different substances through my life. Let's hope this fight ends and all of us win.
Ask me how I know
My ex let me drown on my own and just left me
This is true rap what an amazing song
My life story😔🫂
❤
this song is doing numbers 4mil in 12 days 💀💀💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤❤❤❤💯💯💯💯
I love both artists and this hits hard I lost my favorite cousin to drugs a beautiful life taken from her child’s father putting her on and he’s still alive living 🤦🏾‍♀️ 😢
My oldest son put on this song.  Made me cry made me think of a love one that passed away recently
2 SIDE PENNING G.O.A.T
Every 20 likes I will stop doing drugs for the day
Only thing I’m sad about is Jelly didn’t get to spit a verse. But I think they might have a massive hit on their hands I have been both people in the song, Oxys got me back in the day, I made it out the other side now I just see my nieces, nephews and cousins mixed up with this fentanyl shit. It’s so hard to watch, now I know what I put my mom through.
This shiii made me bawl my eyes like a bihhh (grown ass man suffering with addiction, clean now.)
Like if there is someone you love that needs a prayer. With God all things are possible.
Joyner has the album of the year.... Fight me😁💯🙏🏼🏆👊🏼🔥👑👑👑👑👑
This is amazing guys. Thank you for doing what you do.
And why haven’t I heard this on the radio?
This that deep deep  shit 💚💚💚💚💚
This will help a lot, so many people needed this song! Appreciate it so much man. ❤
After long time I love a song this it. ❤
I keep coming back to this song... shit is so powerful. Im an addict and i just reached a year clean not too long ago. Its been so hard and ive almost given up many times. And i keep trying to help my sons dad get sober but he isnt ready yet... its so fucking hard. Love and addiction, no matter who it is, are a rough mix
Keep coming back it works if u work it and use your meeting resources, your sobor family.
5 Years Opiate Free!!! #Bubba ⛓️🔥
Man one of my best mates passed away 5 years ago to the day and I heard this for the 1st time today talk about pulling on the heart strings!!!
🎶🎶🎶🙏
2 no 3 sides this story has & they are so true. I am thanking my lucky star I ’m still alive. Got sober relaps its a fight but this time I Am Happy and Feel I’m getting out for Me first. Love the lyrics & the song. Bless everyone involved and please: Never Give Up!
yeah brother
This hits Hards to the core.
Love it! very strong and this!
im cleaning up my youtube, and came to unsub from Joyner, cos i have moved on from rap.. i listened to this... how the fuck can i unsub this brilliance! resubbed.
Creating lyrics that could be used as a massive and intense rant in the middle of a fight and then having an actor lip sync them is fucking brilliant. I’m impressed
Sometimes we just need a little help, a hand to reach down and pull us out of the depths that we entered.. sometimes we get lost.. a guiding light can be a savor in the darkest of nights.. sometimes we dig our own graves before it's our time.. a kind gesture can go alot further than most realise.. be kind to one another, show some humanity, never know who you might be saving..
This is poignant 😢
I lost my brother to addiction,  I love you lil bro I miss you every day.
Awesome collaborations
Joyner Lucas?! Yoooo! I’m 12 days too late!
He gon steal your credit card empty your bank account
Damnn this one hit😢
Damn Joyner made shed a tear 😢this one hit home
I lost my kids mother Tito her addiction. This song hits hard.
Listened to this for a while thinking of my mom whose had issues with drugs and pills going through rehab a few times she’s somewhat clean she got prescribed Xanax to sleep but I always fear the bullshit she deals with will make her fall on that cycle again and one day I don’t get a call from her but a damn hospital because she overdosed
Laura Lynn,BB,I love you and miss you more and more everyday.idk why.....hope you're doing ok....
Just wrote a letter to my day 1 who I had to cut off over a year ago cuz his addictions were so bad. Found out he's locked up now. That first verse is eerily similar to wut I wrote. Everyone is worthy of redemption especially lost souls burying trauma with drugs nd booze.
Good Night Shirley!
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙌🏾🤲🏾🤲🏾🙏🏾
It ain't all about that is deeper cause I questioned it to but I'm happy live ur life be true be real don't let evil decide
I'm crying. 😢
Addiction is not a desease it’s a choice!! Quit trying to sugar coat it! I chose to be addicted to Meth! I’m 10 years clean cause I made a choice! Yall want it to be a desease so bad to make yall feel better for the poor choices yall make in life!! 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
This hits so close to home Bro.....this moved my soul .....Thank You for what you do Joyner
Men how is it possible that every song joyner drops is insane,   1. story telling 2. Dope clips like movies, 3. Great Flow, 4. Dope Beats,  Hope you visit Netherlands one Day So i can watch You preform Live, i will be the one throwing a Rose on the Stage !
Song hit me like a ton of bricks juat over 2 weeks sober hoping rhis time i stay that way
Beautiful 😢
Listened to this the hour it released.  12 days later I'm still on a daily roll.  Shit really resounds to me in a life and relationship level.
Wish I could send this to all my cousins that I lost to addiction 😢😢
Jelly roll Joyner Lucas 🔥  I got chills

This my be the first Hip Hop song to make me tear up a little bit
Jelly > Jesus
Is Joyner gay in this video ?! Trooffully?
This is real rap
I’m can’t keep up with the words.  I just know addiction is a sad story.  It’s hard and even when you beat it it’s still a demon that you know
I've never been with the new school flavor but when it's real respect is due. God is good 🙏🏾
Hits my heart jelly!! You helped me get clean somebody save me was my saving grace ..  I grew with you man your music helped me end my 13 year addiction almost 2 years July 23 !! Keep it up big dawg!! You are impacting my neck of the woods in Odenville Alabama!!
If addictions not a disease how the fuck has it gotten to me: straight goosebumps
Las pesadillas se acaban 🇵🇪

Jelly Roll Is A Bonafide SUPERSTAR and Legend At This Point What an Anomaly this man has become. We love you Big Man. You and Joyner... WHAT AN AMAZING PAIR OF HUMAN BEINGS
I’m 11 years sober & I just found jelly roll & this song, and I feel like these songs speak my story. I couldn’t understand the “god has a plan” but all the things that happened that I couldn’t grasp didn’t feel like a plan for my prosper.  But I got tired one day , tired of being sick and tired of having no one.
You don't know what this song says for me
Speaking truth, what the f*** do you mean this isn't a ❤❤❤disease
Joyner is a fucking genius
This is beautiful. Stating facts ❤ we want more of you two❤️
I pray for my sister’s sobriety everyday but they put into words that I never could. God please protect & guide her.
As an 80’s crackbaby ; this hits. What’s understood doesn’t need to be explained.
6 months clean off fentanyl and this hits hard
This song is soooo deep!! Too many of us have loved ones lost!  I was a addict of pain pills got into a recovery program and it works if you want it!!🙏🏻🙏🏻🫶🫶
This hit home hard
My uncle was a addict after my gma passed and i was to young to understand and my family told me and my sister maybe if we could jus said something to him about it he woulda stopped immediately i jus feel like i coulda helped him before it was to late but i was jus young and dumb worried about stupid shi:/ 🕊
Joyner literally talking to Jelly in this song!!!!!
Well damn. Didn’t think expect to get hit by this today
Wish I heard this song years ago 😭 makes me tear up to real cuzz
😢
As hard as it is for some people to understand , but an addict will not and can not get clean for anyone else but for themselves. THEY have to want it for themselves period, or it will never work, addiction is a nightmare that seems impossible to get out of once your in it, but speaking from experience it is entirely possible, but you have to truly want it, also drugs change your brain chemistry also and your way of thinking, that’s also a challenge among countless others… if you want it , it’s possible and things and life get better and people begin to trust you again, never give up
Ang lakas fr.🇵🇭🔥💯
Once again that music with a meaning I'm in tears
Omg i haven't cried during  a song like this.. in a while.. thank u for this 🥹
Wow so Good
My 15 year old lost his dad to drugs when he was 10. Yesterday marked 5 years. I had to let him go for the safety of our son. It’s the hardest thing ever 😢
That was some deep stuff having 5 years clean myself from all drugs
gas
Just spent the last 3 months helping my childhood bestfriend who moved away get sober, what it’s ripped from my life seeing crack and various other drugs and the people involved and what it does to the good people is just horrifying. I really feel from the first verse
Se me puso la piel de gallina al escuchar esta canción 😢😭 vivan sus vidas lo mejor que puedan y nunca se pierdan en el mundo de las drogas porfavor 🙏🏾😊sean conscientes de que no vale la pena 😿😢❤
I wish i had someone to do this for me.... I'm having really rough time right now.. an i never felt so alone... i just can't get a break.... what did i do so wrong to deserve this hell I'm faced with daily.    YES, I AM A DRUG ADDICT I GET HIGH DAILY TO NUMB THE PAIN AN THOUGHTS GOING ON IN ME HEAD EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY I STRUGGLE TO KEEP GOING...  WHAT'S EVEN WORSE IS FOR once i think im thinking different an maybe thats ccause i FINALLY WANT CHANGE..BUT IM SO VERY SCARED...an i ....dont even know how to ... or where to start... i need a hand to hold..  i dont want these drugs anymore i dont want to risk my freedom n life daily i dont want this gun i dont want this scale i dont want this money that i take from peoples hand that are struggling too but buy drugs are their way out too i hate that im one that helps others but never worries about myself n nor does anyone else... an im ok with that... but for once im not ok with it... i need someone i need help i need to he told it going to be ok and that im not alone... i am like a toddler seeking for they mother n blanket n to be held after waking up scared.... but there no one n no blanket... an sadly... i dont just wake up from a nightmare... i woke up to a nightmare.... this shit isnt easy... living in streets 30yr old female hustling doing waht men do out here... i hold my own i get robbed n held at gun point i been kidnapped n worse.. i have tried to take my life ... i have ran away for so long from anyonne tryinf to get close... because the ones that i love or care anout... are the ones that hurt me the worst n i dont want to feel that again its to hard that shit is shit that will really kill you by how much it hurts you... i rather get robbed for all my money n drugs everyday than to fewl that feeling of someone i love to hurt me again....

Im so lost right now... sorry for thus long ass comment... its 3am im in phx, az, an my name is Britin. (ryder)
Best dam song and  duo ever. Never in a million year would I have ever thought these 2 would work together but this world needs it.   Both joyner and jelly speak to the sole of people that don't under stand the world's problems.
Joyner Serious
No different than me,  Them or me,  not what it supposed to be,  Illusion not what it seems,  Grave yards of broken dreams,  They distance screams,  They memories clings,  Life Change brings,  Changing scenes,  Self destructive, so seductive,  In doctors they trusted,  Promises lusted,  Left so many sick and disgusted,  No i will make them answer,  For all they influence,  Leaderships, government, regulated, addiction, affliction,  Intention, the masses bought,  now the suppliers... i will make them listen.
Let's take this song to number 1❤❤❤
song of the year for sure
😢
Reminds me of When Hopsin rapped about drug abuse too...! Great piece.
Buena voz y buen uso de atutonue bro
Fucked me up man!!
This song hits me hard, my brother is addict to heroin and I've been on both side with selective amount of drugs at the same time while dealing with adult ADHD. So I can understand how my add brother is lost in something he's only known since he was 16.... The streets are a nasty demon, it's molded me to what I am today so I don't regret it, but I don't wish it upon no one... Nor do I wish it that they have to cut off someone who was their hero in their baby bros eye because they are so bad off...
this is art, im from argentina and... this is fucking art, i love you bro
I lost my mom to domestic violence, but she was tethered by drugs. It's astonishing how little time destruction needs. Less than a year, in her case. At 16 years old I had to make the decision to let her go because the only one I had the power and control to help was myself.  I love that Jelly Roll is getting the mainstream attention he deserves. I've been fans of both artists for years, and both have their own collection of touching rap songs on this subject. Maybe Jelly Roll will add a verse in the future, Joyner Lucas + Jelly Roll is such a limitless collaboration.
This is 😢
I heard this song today on the radio right after finding out my application was approved for an apartment. I have to leave my husband who suffers from addiction. The decision didn't come overnight, nor without a heavy heart.  But me and our daughter need a chaos  free life now.  Praying for the best. 😢💔
my mom was addicted to heroine since before i was born i stopped asking her to clean because i lost hope she would it hurt me a lot but this year she got clean there’s hope so many years of drug use and she got clean all power and glory to God 🙏🏻
Joyner back
I wish addiction was only drugs, sad people are just sad. May God help all addicts. Love and success to All !!!
I love this song I listen to this everyday now
Hard #bars🔥🔥🔥👀🎤
Absolute banger guys 🇺🇲🤘🔥
Please perform this at Rockville
I’m 21 and just hit 1 year sober (been hooked on pills since 15) I stole from my mom my friends it’s been the hardest year of my life I had to lose everything and everyone before I wanted to get better jelly has been a big part of my journey everyday is a struggle this song is beautiful ❤
i'd break a face over love,   Facts but you live it like eveyday truth!
😞😞😞
God damn felt like my big brother was comin at me with to preach
thank you💗
I’m 2 1/2 years clean I’ve been on both sides I deeply can relate I’m writing this with this tears n my eyes 🥹 I know how hard addiction is I pray anybody with a drug addiction too just pray & believe in yourself it’s light at the end of the tunnel much love ❤️😮‍💨🤞🏽💯
My wife fits this song just right. Don’t get me wrong but there’s so much one can take! It can only be our fault so much before. Well before we feel like it is our fault.  Maybe it is. Maybe it’s not.  But hey can definitely make it feel it is lol.   People have limits but when people like me have had enough. We are the bad guys that can not stick it out for our kids. Hey! You can’t tell me what I have done for my kids. The whole purpose of me being here.  Worlds a cruel fuxkin place & no one gives a good god damn about you.
Damn this song had me almost crying POWERFUL MESSAGE. PLEASE JUST GET HELP
I remember the first time I Hurd jelly roll was “goodnight Shirley” it’s great to see not only have you grown but you still keep that passion and put your soul into it
Man this video got me up in here slinging snott 😢. I just had a cousin pass away back in September. He was very talented but he Cldnt shake that monster! Check up on your struggling friends and family! You never know what’s truly going on with them! You killed it once again Joyner! Thank you brotha 🙏🏾
My son lost his battle 13 months ago. Every word of this song is spot on. It broke me. My son and I had the exact same conversations and arguments. For a song I’ve never heard before, it was like I already knew all the words. I fuckin love it!!! I’ll give you ten thousand views myself.
Bro! Dope!
My aunt passed January 31, 2024 from a Fentanyl overdose and I miss her everyday 😩😩❤️❤️❤️
this song made me cry bro
My friend was addicted to Xanax, eventually moved to harder stuff, it eventually got to the point where I had to step away ignoring his calls because I could stand to see him like, he’s sober now and I love him more than anything❤️
Dax , Joyner , jelly and struggle are my all time favorite singer/rappers
2 of the best artists of this era!
Thank you Joyner.   Your are one of kind.  Artist like you come once in a life time
Joyner the legend ❤
this song hit home so hard!!!
I lost both my mom and my oldest brother to them both ODing and I my self almost went down that same road. I needed this song thank yall. Shit hit hard. I love yalls message
There is someone in my life that was battling with this issue and they are doing better.. It's someone very dear to me and someone who was in my life in very dark times. I love you if you ever read this. I hope you do and know I think about you all the time 🖤💜 I miss you L 🥀
I just lost my mom to addiction I was 15 about to have my 16th bday so this song hits home in a different way if that makes sense bc he’s right how can I let her go when she was my best friend
Sheeeeesh 🥶
He died this month. I wish he could spend Easter with us
To everyone out there clean and sober we're proud of you. To anyone out there who is not, we believe in you. If you need help, just ask.
My mom got addicted when I was around 5 I never left her side even though that meant staying in an environment that wasn't conducive to my survival. People judged me for staying but when it came down to it I was ONLY one who stayed to protect her only for others to speak as if I didn't do my job or left her to die alone. You can't make someone do what they don't want and you can't heal others pain or fix thier lives if they don't want to.  I'm here to tell you don't blame yourself and don't let others blame you, Just do what you can to protect them so they can still have the option to make the choice.
Wish I could've saved my cousin in time,I feel this song deep
Stove on the front porch tho
Thank you for this 🔥🫶🏽🥺
Ive done it. I had to let my best friend go. I couldnt follow her down the road she was going down. But the second her world fell apart i was there. Sometimes the best thing to do is to love someone afar. Sometimes its best to be the supporter in the background. Protect yourselves yall.
Wow! Jelly roll, you are truly a beautiful beautiful person, you have an incredible impact on me. Thank you so much for this.   This is truly an amazing song. Jelly roll, I love you so much. You don’t understand how much you have truly helped me and millions of people around the world. Thank you for everything and making me a better person.   I, myself have seven years clean from benzos and opiates!
Joyner MFN Lucas!! This hits home.
My wife says they keep making songs about me, I'm having such a a hard time changing but it breaks my heart, sometimes just would like to put an end to it all, addiction, heartbreak, guilt, tragedy, etc. I feel like a lot of others just don't understand.
Love this song
my sister was really bad on drugs she would mumble and nod off she when to rehab and got clean I hope everyone can get clean I've known so many people that have battled addiction and some won and some lost
I lived in a meth addiction for almost 12 years. I lost a relationship with my mom, my dad, my grandfather and grandmother on both sides. Now that I am finally clean, they are all dead and gone. I carry an ungodly amount of guilt that I chose dope over their love. This hit hard!! I already loved Jelly but now this man is my new favorite rapper. This is what music is for, to hit us in our feelings and change our lives!
I’m going thru withdrawals rn getting clean off fentanyl for me for my gf for my mom I hate this drug and the grip it holds on people I’m just praying to god trying to take it hour by hour then turning thst into day by day this shit made me cry harder than I have in literslly years to anyone out there trying you got this ik it’s hard I’m going thru it now but don’t give up we can all get through this
As a man whose brother has been struggling with addiction for years this song really cuts deep. Not only has it taken the brother I used to know from me but it’s also robbed my niece from knowing what a great man he was. This song has made me realize that I have been close minded in my approach in helping him by being preaching/ victim blaming and telling him to get clean if he wants my help. I pray anyone who’s struggling with addiction or have family members struggling that you all can make it through the fight.
Sometimes it really takes being there 24/7 to save the one's you love. Sometimes you have to give up your own life for awhile. My sister passed at 19. It broke my mother completely. Then her husband passed. And she was already drinking cuz of my sisters passing. Started drinking more when her husband passed. Painted the house black and Grey. Covered all her windows. Stayed home and tried drinking herself to death. I gave up my first apartment and moved in with her. Started preaching and b¡tching everyday. Until I drove her out of the house. She went and got a job. Came right to life. Stopped drinking all day everyday. And is way better. And I did this while on my 10th year of dialysis and addicted to prescription Dilaudid 4mg pills. Was willing to let myself go if it saved her. But luckily that wasn't the case. Now I am sober and hopefully can get a kidney soon. Songs like this remind us of the pain and anguish. They also remind us that we defeated that beast too. Amen.
Joy my homie fuck a goat you a DOG. This Touched My Soul
Sheesh 😢
Be strong everyone who’s been through this pain and suffering but we’re all strong when we pray and stay focused
this not stupid write song a grip takes you some where to  still believe in person.... hard to reflect on,,,,,
This shit hits home hard. Brought tears to my eyes. Solid collab!!
My uncle really needs this, cuz he be a slave to drugs,and hes only in his early 30, im 14 and this song hit hard.
jellyroll, ur voice in this song made me cry, your voice is so beautiful bro. God I'd give a lot to sit down next to you and just hear your story
Great!!!🙌🙌🤙🔥🔥🔥
My bff died from fentanyl overdose march 20
This song is amazing the visuals are a real tear jerker
The song. The video. THEE ALBUM 🔥🔥
Hey! if you're here in 2050. I want you to know I'm from West Africa and we love Joyner Lucas. I have been following you since 2017 as your music touches the innermost part of our being. I'm battling with my own demons every single day and not giving up. Let's be kind towards one another and create a better space for everyone going through addiction. Stay strong and Be a Good Human...Much love @JoynerLucas
I want to thank you both recording the song my son has been addicted to heroin 4 years my whole family has tried to help him he was just in Temple Hospital in Philadelphia and I really thought this time he would get clean but he just walked out as a mother and all the mothers out there it seems like they just don't care he was in the military he got a scholarship to play football where did my son go I cry myself to sleep every single night he has a beautiful daughter I am trying to do my best like I said for years I've been going through this and my family I say this all the time I know I have to let him go but as a mother I can't everyone thinks and tells me I should but he is my son but now is he really my son from doing heroin all these years he doesn't look like my son😢😢
The actor is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro so dope! Visuals goated! His messages is deep! Lyrical massacre!
Always felt like the good quiet little brother of our family, saw my brother fight mental struggles and punch my sister. Turned 18 and found weed, smoking every day Mabey three day break max. 27 almost tried shrooms tried D#T once, just trying to find myself and heal❤ been living with my GF this whole time. It kills me to hear my older brother and sister trying to heal and get back together, when I feel like the more I share the more of a disappointment I am. I still struggle to talk to my parents (Spanish speaking) growing up in white America, and the division in my lifestyle and theirs makes it soo much harder to reach out and accept their help. I know they are great parents and only ever put us first and it breaks my heart to only see them once ever three months💔. Second verse touched deep. Not pill popping but addiction will make you question yourself sometimes, I pray for everyone to just live your best righteous life and be kind ❤
Never thought I would see myself to be the type of person I always hated and looked down upon, the person I always keep my distance from, the one who I made sure to hurt and realize their mistakes to make it better, to learn…. But wow I became that person that just doesn’t want to thinking, talk, or even look at the world, don’t even want to be apart of it. After 10 years of being with the person I always said “ you know in time we won’t be together and we have to learn to be strong to move on”, and now look where I ended up, eating my own words, being 23 sucks especially when now the only person I ever actually talked to about any little thing that came to mind, is gone. Surely and definitely not slowly I am seeing how many people are actually in my life now, and I can count them on one hand. Where did I go? What did I do? Who will I become? How will I get through this? When will it be over? Why am I like this and why do I feel like not existing anymore? Oh yea I remember, because I made it happen and Im stupid and selfish.
I'm going thru this so bad right now I've been with my fiance for 10 years  and on her part the feeling is gone how can I hold on?
this song wasnt my cup tea until seen the music video and hurts me more because i loved a girl who was addicted to drugs and she used me and i thought was love and cared so much bout her but she was too deep into the drugs i hope shes doing good i wish i could send her this song but she blocked me on all social media
Four years ago yesterday, March 28th,2020 I lost my younger brother. It only has gotten harder it seems. I miss you MC. Never forgotten, forever in my heart. See u again one day..😢🙏
This song hit the soul. Sad, especially when you grew up and around so many addicted family members.
This is so deep n my fight for over 35yrs. To anyone who is still caught please seek help it does get better if u want it n do the work.U ONLY LOOSE WHEN YOU QUIT .🙏🏿
this shit hits too close to home. much love for people out there struggling, i have my own fight and despite it is a physical disease and not related to drug addiction, this song is a carbon copy of what it managed to turn into the relationships with most of my family and so called friends. i am a chronic pain patient considered unable to work (i do anyway) with daily pain coming in extremely intense waves, and somehow is my fault for being too stressed and "not positive" while living this shit. not even wasting my time explaining them how it works, just hope they never get a clutch of undestanding, cause understanding can only come from tasting it on your own skin. In the same time, if u in a similar situation out there, know that for people is genuinely hard to get a grip of what u are dealing with, and being extra harsh to them, despite hard to not to (still working on it myself), does not benefit neither of the parts involved.  again, much love.
Powerful
Joyner I watched your breakfast club interview and I heard you say Em puts you right there with the coles and Kendricks... I say you way higher Bra you are a breth of fresh air my nigga for real, you in your own lane bra💯thank you don't ever change
Bro is the goat at telling stories from 2 different perspectives
Joyner Lucas aka the Muhammad salah of music
I was also a crack addict and mandrax but prayed and let go im Calvin Zanneti and after that I learned that its hard to denie your self but being free is happiness
Wow nice lyrics
Jelly on a Roll 🪼🪼

Don't be  too hard on yourself . Love you
Fighting everyday... its not easy to get clean.
Sent this to my ex bestie and she just replied back with a crying face. I think she’s too far gone 🥺 I’ve been on both sides of this and just want things to go back to normal 😢
I’m young 20 years old I was popping pills at 12 to get rid of the pain my dads ex wife did to me nd my sister drugs was my gateway to get away. But here I am 4 years clean only smoking weed. I’m older nd I forgive her for beating me nd my sister. Sometimes people reflect what’s going on to them. Now I’m older I realize that.
This just made me cry l wish my lil brother would just listen I tried everything to help him I wish he would wake up one day and get clean
I lost my brother 6 days ago due to his addiction and this touched my soul. I wish he heard this song before relapsed
This is F*CKED FOR ALL THOSE INVOLVED AND TOUCHED BY DRUGS. Speaking from experience, they have to want it more than anything. I keep telling my brother that LIFE IS TOUGH FOR ALL OF US! BILLS SUCK, WORK SUCKS, DEATH OF A LOVED ONE SUCKS. ITS EASY TO SAY , F*CK IT. At some point u gotta let 'em go. Today we kicked him out of the house. Driving him home to his daughter. Maybe he'll listen to her. That's his decision. Yes, this hits VERY HARD.
I’ve been kicking my weed habit recently, now I gotta work on the alcohol before it’s too late.  This hits hard, like I’m talking to myself in both perspectives.
God bless you thank you for this !! ❤❤ I'm almost 9 years clean but there's not a day that goes by that I don't think about it frfr an this song hits hard truly makes me think positive even more !!! 🙏🙏🫶🫶
Emotional, victim of a father, who was on drugs for 20 something years of my life and broke our family up is here home. This man is the truth. Please continue to make music.
FIGHT THE FIGHT!!!!!  STAY SOBER AND STAY STRONG. TAKE YOUR LIFE BACK. 💯💯💯🖤🖤🖤
🔥🔥🔥
Not on a drug level but alcohol. This song hits home for me since it’s been a little over a month since my oldest sister passed away due to her liver from all the drinking over the years.😞💔❤️‍🩹 RIP sis! Love you Joyner!!!
This should have a billion views
I lost my Brother to a Fentanyl Overdose. One of the worst days of my life. I miss him more than anything in this world.  This song hits home. I'm six months clean now Myself & I'm never looking back. ❤️

How you gon get Jelly on a track and not have him spit? Shit's wild... But aside from that, this shit hits me so deep. But not the first verse... I'm hurting inside, and this shit gives me hope that someone is seeing this and understanding it from a different side of things. It's hard for everybody out here. Good luck to everyone, and love.
My gf was sober 2 months and literally relapsed right after i sent her this song, wtf? Fml
I pray for everybody who hears the song that it crush that spirit of addiction! I pray for radical change in your life. YOU can overcome this! YOUR addiction and trauma have to bow to God and it will no longer control you! You are loved, and you are worthy of so much more. I praying for your freedom. God bless you ❤️
The second verse with the dude, spoke volumes if you know you know!!!

I'm dealing with this hell every day. Your shits fire..ty
I don't do hard drugs but I do smoke weed and carts , and I get super edgy when I don't have my stuff or when I run out or run low I shouldn't be acting like that there is more better important things in life then drugs or weed or carts or alcohol get high on life and God
hard
Love this shit...facts
Hits in so many ways this song cuts to the core on so many levels y’all this song can be taken how ever you need it to but it’s helping get through this divorce
I hear you mom
This song brought tears to my eyes.
Tuff
This hit home. My aunt and uncle were heroine addicts. One od and passed when I was kid and the other she got clean but touched fentanyl and she’s gone now 😢😢
Man…. Yesterday marked my two year mark away from my allergy. This makes me cry so fucking hard.  Cause ive been there.
Hell of track
May you heal from the drug addiction and problems you've been through
Lost my brother to overdose 2 years ago I miss him everyday 💔
My mother is an addict. She became an evil person and I know it's not her. She is so lost in the sauce that she is living in her own perception of reality. She became abusive and and manipulative... It's so bad that I can't maintain my composure even she crosses my mind. I do my best to walk with god and try to get through to her but I can't. How can I get through her? I'm afraid I'm going to lose her to addiction. I would give anything and i mean anything to get through to her. I beg for options and beg God to show her the light. What do I do?
I lost my oldest sister to a drug overdose. And my other sister is on drugs. I've helped her so many times to get better, and she keeps going back to drugs idk what to do any more our last conversation she told me she don't want the help. She's vary aware of our oldest passing away from an over dose. But she Continues to do heroine.
Joyner music is art in its truest form. Don’t change bro 💪🏾🙏🏾
Jelly is top five auto tune singers
It worked out fine for me I'll pray for him every 🙏 night nothing like a good ending to ex addicts story i met the kindest people in that part off life the worst of them live or lives among us fact Tipperary Ireland 🇮🇪 💯🙏
Best album Em brought out in yrs but that new English 🇬🇧 drill is Class too do💯 that Cordae 👌 👏 🔥 could b Em,s best sign up ever still young better coming I can feel it💯forever Rap on repeat 💯
Joyner and Jelly are the perfect combination for a perfect song.
Beautiful song
addiction IS a disease, and I choose unconditional positive regard ❤ I separate the person from the disease
The hardest song I heard in 2024!!!!!!
I dont do drugs besides weed. But god im holding tears back knowing my dad and almost everyone i truly love are addicted to pills meth and fet 😢
Love the message but as an ex addict and a felon.. addiction is not a disease. Don't let the medical field monetize your drug use. You either stop or suffer the consequences. Can't blame anyone but yourselves. Don't let anyone tell you different.
Let the healing begin! Ty 4 this gem
I have an alcoholic mother and our childhood was hell. I’ve always focused on my pain but not hers. This song brought me to tears and is amazingly powerful 😢
Wow man I love music that hits home with life, addiction, and pain. I’ve been there. Recovery is such a blessing. People don’t understand til your in it. Great job Joyner and Jelly!😊
Now, everybody in the comments. want to tell their life story
i almost died from mdma overdose, i did it for 3 years daily, i stopped because i had a newborn coming and all of a sudden i felt a higher purpose in life
Wow so crazy how much I can relate to this. 5 years clean but I still have my bad days. I needed to hear this
This hits sooo hard emotionally
Good to see rapper these days actualy rap and not just mumble the same line 40 times
my cousin is on meth an cocaine herion etc they dont even know where he is at 22 now it was sad he was shown how to use the drugs by his own step dad.
Nashville up 1🫡😁
my sisters ex girlfriend has not reconginzed that she has a problem.even if she attended aa meetings
My sister is addicted to fentanyl I’m hoping she will get help 💔
Well shit I had to jump out of the shower and save this. Definitely got a new subscriber this shit hit hard and I’m not even sure on what level I feel like just all around that shit deep.
Straight 🔥!!!
I just want to give my testimony . I’ve struggled with addiction for longer than I can keep track of now . My kids got taken , my family turned their back on me and I was alone . I’m still alone . I’ve gotten on a MAT program and it’s still not good enough . I go every week to my doctor . I pee every time I go . I’m trying to do things the right way now and I’m still looked down on . Please don’t abandon people or disregard friends or loved ones that are struggling with this same situation . Please don’t make them feel like they’re insignificant or a waste of space time or effort . It’s one thing to monitor a situation or interactions . It’s a whole other thing to completely disregard someone in every way because of what they’re facing and fighting . The one thing we need is love . Sometimes we forget to love ourselves and care about ourselves . Just please be mindful of your influence in someone’s existence .
Jelly rolls music has saved me so many times.
wow!
#REALTALK Iv been a Addict for years after losing my little brother from suicide..... #BLANKING_THE_MIND
God damn jelly and Joyner 🙏 goosebumps and tears when listening to this
One of the hardest tracks of heard this year and I never was addicted to any drugs but this definitely will help someone who NEEDS TO HEAR IT‼️
Joyner never ceases to amaze me.
Grammy worthy?
This hit home ❤
Wow really hits home thanks
Honestly this made me think of my daddy, and I feel like he would really like this song. He told me how he was homeless and addicted to heroin and had a drinking problem in his younger years, but got clean on both. Stayed sober up until he passed in his home a few years ago from cancer. Miss him everyday
Thank you
Love this, I've been sober for 11 years and the only way I was able to get sober 11 years ago was to be arrested, sent to rehab and my family totally disowning me. They had to tell me that if I didn't get sober they didn't want ANYTHING to do with me. They did it out of love and I thank God every day they did it!! I have been able to repair every relationship I burned during my addiction. I'm so grateful I now get to share my story with people today with my job of a paralegal and lucky I didn't lose my career of 25 years from my addiction. God had a different plan for me. I pray for the addict who is still suffering and that is newly sober and their family that they can be strong!! This disease kills!!
This song really does hit different and thank you so much for this ...can't wait to see you in May
Deep 😢
Jesus Joyner always great with the story telling in his lyrics. Man this was great.
I wish I could’ve played this for my mom 🖤
I have Ben clean for 9 years and this song hits close thank you guys this song helps me stay clean I play it every day ❤❤❤❤❤ I appreciate you guys and your music I’m trying to make the may 19 show and hope to meet you
I spent 24 years of my life as a addict recovery is possible
This song givesme chills. RIP T-Bo we love you bro
Obviously, it's an addiction to pills, not heriorn.. let them mfs suffer... i hate junkie mfs.
For everyone struggling with addiction you can overcome this horrible nightmare it’s not going to be easy but it will be worth it you’ll never get your old self back the self that was before drugs but you’ll have someone even better stronger more understanding and you’ll learn patience for yourself and to the family continue to love them not enable there is a difference your family memeber is still in there and loves you and needs to HEAR they are LOVED and CARED ABOUT and that you’ll NEVER GIVE UP ON THEM!!
A lot of people fighting on the front lines in the war on mental health and addiction are gunna get handed a lot of hard pills to swallow after hearing this song. At least that's the case for me. Thank you Joyner and Jelly. I needed to hear this song.
I know jts hard but please dont hate your family when they are in an addiction, hate the disease. 😭 i lost so many from this damn disease, it hurts. 😭.
😭😭😭😭
kove the positive message.. Ive had Hundreds of people Inused to cut there hair die from OD, when they went to H or got fentanyl in a fake pill..ud be a idiot to take anything from anyone today..PS.fent. comes from Communist China,they sell it to Cartels and they flood USA with the poison and they do want the USA dead...  str8 up attack on generations of people in USA.. get clean please people..
great song..i have to wanna get clean in order to move forward..havent taken a pain Pill in 14 yrs now
The feels is crazy, my sister left her two kids with my parents two years ago a month before I got married. I said some fucked up shit when she was stealing from us all I feel my words are semi responsible and it sucks. I reach out everyday just to be left on read. I try every fuckin day. I'm just waiting to make funeral arrangements with my parents at this point
These lyrics make me think of my Nephew and my Baby Brother. 🎉😅
Man this gotta be one of the dopest songs to come out in awhile, with actual meaning & two dope Artist to talk about it 💯❤️‍🩹
🙏💐👑🌬️🐞🌖🌒🌀🧬🦍
Derived from the Heart.❤😢
This song dropped just a few days after I lost one of my best guy friends to alcholism. He was doing so great! 2 years sober, then one night, the deamons came back. We hadn't heard from him for a couple of days, so the police were called to do a welfare check. He was found deceased with alcohol bottles scattered around his body. He was such an amazing man. He had a rough life growing up. His mom was found dead at the bottom of their stairs. I remember the police knocking on our classroom door in kindergarten. Addiction is so not fair. There needs to be easier access to help for Addiction & Mental heath. Both are combined. Most addicts have a mental health problem or suffer from depression. This country needs to step it up before addiction & mental health problems take more of our loved ones. Addiction doesn't discriminate!! ❤
The whole song make me nicely GOOSBUMP
This song hit me hard, very moving and relatable.
I need help I'm addict in pornography
Yeet!
This is so beautiful, hard to hear, and so meaningful. Gave me chills.
every morning I wake up and sat I wont drink....6pm and Im drinking again
I love these deep songs with meanings behind them + the music videos so touching I replayed it so many times
I wish you could do a song with NF
Joyner you a blessing ❤....
how do you get these white boyz to rap like this ?
Joyner Lucas will forever be a GOAT in story telling
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥🔥  BEAUTIFUL
Caseoh is that you?
Thank you I am an artist who has struggled for years and it's hurt the talent that they say I have this hit
I lost my younger brother to a OD/Suicide. To this day, one of the hardest loss in my life. He was the most lovable person. I miss him every single day. 😢
I think this song just changed my life
This is one of the best songs I have ever heard
Im sorry Dad I'm gonna make a change i really needed this fhank you
I let my best friend go due to drugs and she died and I'll never forgive myself. I shouldn't have walked away. I'll never find a platonic love like that ever again.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
this is hard!!! definitely going thru this with my bro!!!! ive tried but damn he's going thru it bad even tho he knows the outcome!!!!
I like both these guys, but Jelly Roll, dude if you let them make you sound like that again I will never listen again. That auto-tune crap makes you sound stooooopid. Don't let these industry fools ruin you. Upchurch is what he is because he's untainted by the industry. Follow that lead.
Yeah this hits home.
The amount of people that relate to this song.. absolutely devastating. Nothing but positive vibes from me. I've been there. I know what this feeling is like. ❤️
Never thought I'd become a alcoholic. And now every says I look sick and they don't know who I am. Song made me feel attacked in a good way. It's time to let them go so I don't hurt them because I don't see the light yet.
The hardest thing to except in life is when somone has to fill in your empty space when you thought you had it all handled its so hard to love someone but have to let them go !!!
Me and my wife was addicted herion for 6 years we lost everything time and time again March 27th we will celebrate 5 years clean. And looking back at what drugs will do and make you do is terrible .. my mom was a drug addict my dad was an alcoholic both brothers addicted to meth and 1 sister . It has always been hard but WE DO RECOVER  WE HAVE TO BREAK THE CHAIN OF ADDICTION!!!!
Some of the best songs that hit the hardest, can paint the most emotional pictures.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
My brother died two years ago from a Fetanyal overdose. Worst day of my life. I miss him more than anything in this world. This song hits right in the heart. I am now six months clean myself & never looking back.❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥 💯

I have been on both sides of addiction and I feel this in both levels and it hurts so much I lost my brother to addiction and it really opened my eyes
I don’t have anyone in my life that’s an addict but this song hits hard 🔥🔥
This song gives me chills addiction runs in my family and it’s never easy
This is a pretty different song when youre listening to it after they died.
To my husband, No matter which way you go… I love you! I’ll be waiting for you to come back to me but if you never do - it’s okay too 😢
I guess we all wanted to numb ourselves from something ❤ # you can heal
💔💔💔💔💔
God Steven walk away it’s worth it…❤ No meth for 2 years now.. I  won’t ever forget where I came from!! You can heal ❤️❤️❤️
Lost my oldest brother 😢to fucking drugs! Wish he was here to hear this song 😢
I just heard this song for the first time an hour ago and it saved me
LOVE THIS SONG.
Shit deep, deep.
Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 1: Joyner Lucas] Yeah, I got somebody I love (Yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (Damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (Yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (Woah) But I wrotе this song in hopes when they'll hеar it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it enough (Woah) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (Damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and you makin' feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (Do what you might, woah) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (Tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (Lose it) And you wan' deny all about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin'  or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me   [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 2: Joyner Lucas] Look, I know you been callin' for me (Yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long, I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (Uh) How do I look go of something I know is something is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (Nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, I'm tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me  [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?

ive heard of someone built like a refrigerator but i aint neva seen someone built like a 4 burner stove my god
Wish jellyroll had a verse tho
The world needs more art like this. I have more people I love than fingers on my hands who’ve had some addiction issues. This song hits deep. Thanks for the gospel Joyner!
Joyner and Jelly, a match I never knew I needed ❤ shit hits hard and so close too home
Pardyalone i was at your concert in LA a few months ago and your performance was impecable I cried while hearing your vocals LIVE xoxo I can so relate to this new song its beautifully expressed you are so gifted !!
Hopefully this can heal some people
My kids lost their father and I lost the man I loved and spent 7 years with  3 years ago to his battle of addiction. He struggled for so long to stay clean but ultimately it just wasn't enough. Hardest thing I ever went through was loving someone who struggled daily and I couldn't fix him no matter how hard I tried.
Yo Ese this hits everyone at home everyone knows someone 🙏🏼  help your friends and family save there life 1 pill 💊 is all it can take 😢ive lost too many way too many ppl God only knows border states are so flooded 1$ is all they need its the devils work
🥺🥺🥺🥺🔥❤️❤️ much lov
Bro your amazing I love all your music that speaks on god In people. Feel like your a true worrier for good
This is really beautiful. It brought be to tears. I've lost so many friends and loved ones to this disease. I, myself, am clean and sober from opiates for sixteen years now. I couldn't be happier with my life. There IS light at the end of the tunnel, you just gotta want it bad enough.
I am a recovering alcoholic with almost 8 years of sobriety. Every single day without a drink is as precious as the first. For everyone who is struggling with addiction, YOU CAN DO THIS! FIGHT THE FIGHT!
this words hit the soul i swear
This song really hits home to a lot of us and brings light to the mental health & drug problem we face here in US<√
I watched this 6xs in a row and cried each time #Respect
Prayers to you
Music that can really reach people! Joyner is a true artist and tells both side of the story so beautifully. Jelly is a real one, if you don’t know listen to his Wild Rode podcast.
Thank you Joyner 508 buddy
Heavy !!!
Jelly Roll is a Rat. Testified on Capitol Hill!!! "I'm on the Side of the Law"!!! He said.
A Lyricist with a cause  Is a Dangerous thing  Joyner n jelly  The world need more of y’all
Joyner,  What a beautiful song.
I hate how this hits home.
1 year 4 months of clean and sober
That 1st part really hits home for me
Coming up on 5 years sober. Good shit. This gave me chills.
We can beat Addiction.
Heavy
I lost my bestfriend since high school to drugs. I wish I could get her back 😢😢😢 She started to steal from me, lie to me and deceive me. I'm  31 and still cry at times. Her kids yearn for her love and i try to be there but i started having my own and it kind of slowed down. I never knew someone so strong, beautiful and ambitious become a victim to drugs. She was such a good mom and it hurts to look in her daughters eyes sometimes. I've learned it can take over anyone's life. Anyones!!!  We have to pray for those who are suffering from this disease called addiction. 🙏🏾😔
Forever36 😢😢
Good job Lucas & Jelly Roll🔥. This song touched my spirit! Way to bring real music back
🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
why does this hurt so much man i guess im indenial and living his life not seeing the pain im causing others i use cocaine not daily every friday night to cover the fact well i guess deep down im depressed man but this here is my step 1 in stopping fully and sorting my life out  i wanted to share this hoping someone else can make the same step as i am right now we will do this together WE ARE GOING BEAT THESE ADDICTIONS 100%
Down to come to Corpus for quinceanera
Me and my girl are going through a rough time currently. This song hits so hard. 😢❤
DAX X JOYNER X JELLY
CAN ANYONE SAY GRAMMY BOUND 2025
This one is on repeat mode ❤🙌🏾✅ salute #Joyner
This song 😢😢😢❤❤ ...
I wish Jelly would have rapped on it as well.
😢 sent it to my mom
Wow what an amazing song. As a recovering opiate addict who's been clean for multiple years now and this song literally left me in tears!!! If anyone who is dealing with addiction and reads my comment just know it is possible to stop and it is possible to regain your life back and regain relationships you lost because of drugs. It takes a lot of work but just know you are special and there are people who love you and you can take back control of your life!!
thank you - 11 years of addiction , fentanyl/tranq and crack. it almost killed me. in 7 days ill be two years clean ❤
Wish the song was out before I lost my mom been two weeks since she passed god rest her soul
I will eat one chicken tender for every like this gets
JOYNER done it all.... i give you your flowers G.
We love you Joyner!
read some of the stories in the comments section i hope everyone battling some form of addiction finds the strength and the will power to better themselves and save themselves from self destruction i truly believe yall are strong enough physically and mentally to push thru.
Great song but why ain’t jelly got a verse??😒
Man this touches me in a hard way I was the one that was on the bad side of this song but thanks to God 4 yrs sober
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING
I’ve been on both ends of this song . I genuinely couldn’t tell you which side feels worse . They both equally took a huge piece of me , and an even bigger piece of the ones close to me . I love that Joyner Lucas has always been able to capture both ends of the spectrum . From suicide , to addiction . Well done.
Heroin brought me death... God brought me life. Just believe 🙏
Lord every time I hear this I think of my addiction and hurting my loved ones
you all sleeping on joyner get this shit to a billion views
This song hit home, I lost my parents 6 months ago in a murder suicide. My father was a severe alcoholic with severe PTSD that ended up with him resorting to using drugs as well in the end to help him "cope". He refused to get help, no matter what we told him. All we showed was love and concern and he decided to do something that destroyed both my younger brother and my life forever. This song definitely expresses what we are battling and what we were going thru when they were still around. For those of you that are battling drugs or struggling to deal with your vices, just think about what you may be putting your kids/family thru when you take your dose. Its not only affecting you, its affecting the people that love you, even if it may seem to you that its not.
Wow this song is amazing
❤✅💯
MAN💯
This song reminds me of my son's dad he was a meth addict he took his own life 4/23/23 😢
Goosebumps ❤❤
I don’t throw the term genius around much musically, but Joyner ❤❤❤❤
You just don't even know best combo ever you guys are legendary you should be in the top charts love both your music's legit. ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
1 Corinthians 15 3-8  Romans 10 4-13
I'll sit up everyday an push for whoever you are just know that! God bless all an any who struggle 🙏🏼
12 years clean. 🫶
This song is the closest thing to NA on a beat❤❤❤
This song really needs to break records. Not the muble bullshit. Everyone in thr world needs to know about this and keep listening and learning from this. Stop calling people junkies, they are someone's child, they didnt wake up one day and say i want to be a drug addict when i get older. Have faith and stop with the negativity!!
🔥
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
Thank you Mr Lucas
I just wanted to take a moment to appreciate your incredible artistry. Not only does it have a profound impact, but it's also relevant and thought-provoking. Your music has the power to make us love differently, think differently, and approach the world in a whole new way.  I still remember the first time I heard one of his songs. It was about a high school kid who was being used by someone pretending to be their friend, but you presented both perspectives brilliantly.  then, I've gone down the rabbit hole of your music and even listened to you rap in reverse. I've been sharing with everyone that you're my favorite rapper, and it's amazing to see their reactions when they discover your talent.  I want to express how proud I am of this guy artistry. This song is going to touch so many hearts and offer a different perspective to those battling drug addiction. Thank you, brother, for your realness and the way you pour your heart into your music.  Keep inspiring us with your incredible talent.  Much love and respect.
Hardest thing is to let someone go when they are on drugs you never really let them go you just stop helping feed their addiction in any way it’s a very hard sad situation
Lame I thought jelly was gonna rap how can u get a record with joyner and not spit, go do some more country songs sellout
This is the Joyner I love. Write more music like this.
This song is 🔥 so grateful to be clean and sober
Now that is what you call a beautiful song. Wow is the only word that comes to mind thank y’all so much because that really hits home
😭 this song hit different  thank you
We need this album miss real rap 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Gah damn bro sent chills down my spine with this one here
Am I wrong to say this goes beyond addiction? Man this hits so hard but it is speaking to me on a whole different level 😢
Great story Mr lucas
5 years clean in May love the song
My husband's oldest friend is somewhere on the street and we cant find him. We had to get some distance so we could get clean off heroin. ( Been in recovery and clean for 3 years now). But that self8sh distance we needed to get clean is the same distance thats making our boy not hit us back and im so scared. To get clean, you HAVE to be selfish. And its ok. But you'll have to pick up a lotta pieces after and it makes it harder to help others.  Please pray for Diamond  God bring him home and heal him. 🙏  Im sure he's a Jelly fan, so jopefully he sees this and know we love him and want the best for him and his wife.
🤯🤯🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥
The fact that Joyner Lucas always finds people who are genuinely fans of his craft is underrated, I mean dude in the video rapped those lyrics like they are really his.
How is it that J Cole, Drake and Kendrick are discussed as the best of the newer generation without mentioning Joyner? We need to bring this man into the conversation asap!!
Can’t even have a genuine convo without you starting to preach 😢😢💔
❤️
Thank you for this.  3 years sober and wouldn't go back. I love my babies to much and I love having my soul
I don't like the fact that u are putting a false narrative out here ..u should have had white powder a needle and spoon on the floor not a bottle of prescribed pills.. the opioid crisis is illict fentanyl and zylazine not pain medication .I'm sorry but there is sick people out here dieing in horrible pain because of this false narrative..
Rip to the love of my life Amanda York 1/29/23 I caused a big scene when I learned she was getting high again it ruined us didn’t talk for a year, then I was there confirming her fucking body.  To anyone still using. Your people still love you get sober please I am 39 and never will I love again she was it
How do we??????😢
Fire!!!!  Recovering addicted, 04/11/2013 almost 11 years. I should have died multiple times. If I can do it, anybody can do it! Call someone, talk to someone, find something to live for, find something to fight for. You are worth it and can do it!
Young people are now high on drugs, i pray to god to let themselves recover sooner 🙏
never disappoint - loved jelly n your sound together, really compliments
🇱🇾🫡❤
i watched my mother kill herself over the years on drugs and when she passed i ended up going threw the same shit she did i know both sides too well im just glad i made it threw it and got clean . mind over matter i promise u can do it too before its too late .
This song makes me think about my ex.
As someone who's been 4 years sober, this song fucking hits me like a train. My wife's the reason I'm clean. She found me 4 years ago and dragged me off my ass and onto my feet. She made me see who I am without it and I'm so much happier without it.
This stuff is true started at 15 years old doing drugs and I’m 35 now and 6 years clean. It went from easy money to going to jail and staying on the streets to haven a beautiful family. I thank god he didn’t take my life away the 2 times I over dosed.
Jelly roll you are my big hero though love you man
It touched my soul this song fits every bit of me
[Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 1: Joyner Lucas] Yeah, I got somebody I love (Yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (Damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (Yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (Woah) But I wrotе this song in hopes when they'll hеar it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it enough (Woah) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (Damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and you makin' feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (Do what you might, woah) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (Tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (Lose it) And you wan' deny all about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me  [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 2: Joyner Lucas] Look, I know you been callin' for me (Yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long, I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (Uh) How do I look go of something I know is something is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (Nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, I'm tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?
We need more jelly this is a great collaboration
Jesus loves everyone
I'm here, like the thousands of others who battle addiction every day. Its been close to 8 years since I've touched a pain pill and booze. By the age of 16 I was a drunk. By 18 I was a full blown alcoholic. Somehow I managed to graduate HS and move down to the lower 48 (I currently still live in North Pole, Alaska) and by 20 I was hooked on pain pills after a really bad crash racing quads. Here I am almost 36, single dad with an angel who turns 8 this coming May. That angel happens to be my daughter, who came into this world and saved my life. And she knows it. I have told her many times. When she is old enough, and wants to know how, we will have that discussion.   My prayers go out to anyone & everyone who deals with addiction. You, Yourself, a loved one, family member, anyone. Just know you aren't alone.
I spent 16 yrs addicted to coke and this song hit a nerve because hit showed me what my lil brother basically was thinking seeing me like that 😢😢😢
I Sampled This On My Channel
Sending this my lost cousin out in Texas I pray that you find your way back home C.J. ❤️
Perfect timing ⏱️ ❤️💪🏼
Such an INCREDIBLE song!
I miss who she was and who she used to be, but im devastated and disappointed we ended the way we did. Thank you jelly for your healing voice ❤️
thank you so much for this, this message is much needed by me and the world .
so real
I’m 10 almost 11 months sober from fentanyl and this song made me burst into tears because the beginning of this is how my wife and family was and the second part is how I felt. It’s so crazy what addiction does and how blurry everything becomes.
12 years clean. Lost my little brother to an overdose 5 years ago. I've been on both sides of this, this song literally brought me to tears. Thank yall for speaking so much truth.
100
I think if you substitute the concept of "addiction" with "depression" you'd be hitting a lot closer to the root of the problem. People who are healthy mentally don't become addicted to drugs. You're allowing the symptoms to distract from the cause.
"How come youre only there for me when im tryna get clean"??? Are you joking? Everyone thats dealt with addicts knows the answer to that. The only time you can help someone is when they help themselves. So why would anyone be there for you when youre a junkie?
I love these types of songs that Joyner Lucas dose it really touches the heart and the fact that jelly roll is on the track to brings it to a whole different level I would love to see y'all calibrate again on a project
I think it's self soothing as best it can
Damn Joyner, I always feel your songs, somehow relatable for me. Thankyou 🥹🥹🥹
Unless it's a none blood brother it won't help my mind trap...it specifically pinned VERY on point...locked up asf
Damn... This chit hit hard, he's describing my life.
My Aunt Della sent me this. I love it. So true. I'm in tears. Thanks for the beautiful song
Jerron Benton would be dope on this
My twin brother sent this to me and said this song reminded him of me and so I Iistened then I just broke down crying cuz I realize this is me..
This honestly reminds me of me I was a bad pill Addict but family got me clean god bless Joyner Lucas
This hits hard, my mother passed in 2020 due to her severe alcohol dependency. That's also why I don't drink.
I don't know if his boy needs a wife beater over that body hair t-shirt but this was fire regardless
This sing hit home for me.  It's so hard loving someone with an addiction.
Cleanest Collabo of 24’ !! Young Joyner killin that flow with JellyRoll on that Hook 🫡 my booyyy
This song hit different when you can relate when you are experiencing this from either perspective
This is needed to put out for the world to hear 🤍 Thanks Joyner and jelly 🪄
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Goat
🤍🩷
I hope this touch many souls addict out there, we have to make it reach them.
Jelly, Joyner, perfect hook, perfect verses. Gives understanding from one side to another, that isn't normally permitted due to emotional responses.
I hope Joyner blows up like jelly did. It’s cool jelly did this song with him
I needed to hear this song before I got worse..... I sent it to my husband, he hasnt Listened to it like I'd hope he would.. I'm fighting for my life and he cant even see it but judge me and push me away more
The drummer is ahead of his time with the big covid plexiglass savoir.  Before the dictation.
Thx for that song i wish that young youth could hear and listen si they wont fall in drugs addictions to thé point of loosing it😢. blessing
Sometimes living in a body really hurts.
It took my brother after he stopped using 🤕
This brought me to tears!
🔥 🔥 🔥
Be thankfull people  please better our self  the fact we can let our self down for otherbpeople
Too much song for me  too come to terms the fact this is true what he is saying   😢😢
This will help someone.
I need help. I never thought my first time saying that would be in a comment on a youtube video. Thank you for this song. I can see a light at the end of the tunnel...
I just finished watching porn and I feel less of my self 😢 What came to my mind straight up was this second.  I can’t lose this fight.  Tomorrow is another day to fight 😔
POWERFUL!!!
JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY FOR TRUE PEACE
I know someone...but I won't say their name
Damn
This was written beautifully ❤ love goes out to all those who suffer from addiction or suffer from loving someone with an addiction❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥
The tears😭😭😭 two of my favorite artists, a song with deep substance and meaning🙏🏼🙏🏼😭😭😭   To all the addicts still in active addiction, YOU ARE WORTHY. You are LOVED! You deserve to be sober and LIVE! Help is out there
This is my 12th time listening to this back to back
I have to give it to Joyner man, he has an amazing way to look at an issue from both sides of the window that divides us, he sees them both and does what many of us can't do and that's see and understand, not just see and judge.  He did this 6 years ago with I'm not Racist and he does it again with this song.  He really is what we need in life showing us that there is a way to find understanding in each other.  Something that truly feels lost in this world right now!
*YOUR FAVORITE RAPPERS.. FAVORITE RAPPER !!*
I ain't addicted I'm just trying to die.
GOOSEBUMPS ❤
Hope Your Cuz Gets Better Man 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Telling someone their addiction is a disease is literally the worst thing you can do for them. Shame on you who think it is.
Oh my god  jelly role your voice is magical on this track  absolutely mesmerizing ! Please do a  song that us you all the way . I do love the message in this song . I am addicted  and life can become very rough and not  much of a life at all. .  im wodkjng thrh it

Addiction is a common struggle for many American families.
This Shit Hit Different we needed this one...#Joyner&Jelly
I gotta get clean..
On my way to rehab because of this song. Thank you
Fuck this gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. I’m fighting addiction. It’s so fucking hard. How can I put a pill in front of my family . Why does it call to me everyday trying to get me to slip and return to the darkest places I’ve ever been. Thank you for this song.  I’d love to hear you guys do something with Colicchie
I'm hear
Damm this song needed 1 more verse .  Top artist ...every now and then joyner comes with an abserlute master piece. Timeless
Meth head music
Bro tells a story in EVERY song. Top tier rapping.
Buttery pig squill
This shit breaks my heart, wish my little brother was clean
Joyner 🐐
❤❤❤❤❤
When first herd this touched the soul fr fr but never really watched the full video but I finally watched the full video an was looking at it from a different perspective an changed the character into a dog like he said talking about  God an it just reminded me of the bound with my dog
I wish Jelly would have had a verse on this but great either wayyyy!
Dey tried to put me in rehab. Addicted to makin fire music 🔥 My YouTube is not for da weak
Alot of those who I love have or are involved with drug addiction. It's influenced my life and I pray that those still on drugs make it out.
Love this.
Heard this and shed a tear icl, I lost my dad two years ago, he drank himself to death and now my mum has stage 4 pancreatic cancer caused from alcoholism, but she was 17 months sober after 20 years of addiction four months on from diagnosis and she’s giving up, I’m 25 and I feel like I’ve lost everything I’ve struggled the last 10 years of my life with addiction to different drugs only have medical cannabis now and it helps. I keep going in hope of better days and have to because who else will be here to make sure I fulfill my dreams I’m here to make them proud, keep your loved ones close 🩵
Jelly roll sounds amazing!
damn I dropped a few tears Joyner and Cole are the only rappers that can do that
My brother went to job Corp graduated and got pharmacy technician certificate. After grad he started doing drugs and went down hill. We didn't see it. We where close.  I'm soo disappointed and it hurts. This song says it all.
Jucied up roll looking like a singing perc🎉
I sent this to my brother and mom I’ve been at war with my addiction and demons for 15 years and have 2 years clean this song really gave us a better understanding of both sides and we are working on our relationship
Bring this music back 🙏
this song gave me chills I needed this !!
I’m not crying, you’re crying 😭
Best song I've heard this year.
I never understood how addicts work and their mental and emotional state of minds. Joyner…. U and jelly have helped me understand how to deal with addicts because I know someone who I JUST sent this to and she called me in tears asking and begging me for help and telling me thanks for understanding her demon. I’m going to help her get out of this storm all because of This song. I’ve always assumed these people refuse to change and I forgot that most are really tryna escape. I cry now EVERYTIME I hear this song. I’m done judging. I’m ready to help. Thank you so much for this song. I’m sure it’s helping a lot of us.
I'm in recovery currently and I'm trying to do what's best for me. It has been the hardest but most beautiful path I will ever take. Jelly Roll, you're HEALING people. You're healing ME. 🖤🫀
This is dope just like the previous song "I'm sorry", keep making more songs like this, we men need it💯🔥🔥🔥🙌
Perfection. Thank you.
not only is it 2 of the best in the game on a track but damn does this song hit.

Lost both my parents to drugs my dad passed in 19 from fentanyl and my mom in 21 meth use caused her to have a stroke
This song hit me hard. Lost my best friend to heroin 7 years ago. I wish I could talk to him just one last time 😭
Oh wait Jelly Roll killed the hook, he reminds me of Grossburger🤷🏽‍♂️
Joyner is a legend. He has always made some inspirational songs 💪💪💪
Thanks Joyner. I had a miracle and got a second chance to change. I survived addiction over 2 open  heart surgeries in a years time at the age of 29 and. I'm trying daily. Your saving alot of lives. From the bottom of my heart thank you men for the help. ❤ Life peace and light
Unrealistic house is to clean
Been clean and sober from alcohol and herion for 18 years now... to anyone struggling, please know you can beat this... namaste
I lost my cousin two years ago to a overdose and I miss him terribly so I just wanna say that I love this song it hits me so hard I cried and I’m not gonna lie
Jelly roll has killed so many young kids by dealing fetynal😢
some typa of inspirational and motivational words the streets been dying for❤❤
Addiction is not a disease it is in your mind. A disease is something that you cant control with your mind
I been alone so long.  I'm harder to reach.              Nobody's perfect not even you.  Tune.    🙏✋
Yessss, this is fire....
I really wish jelly roll would have put some bars in
You’re story telling within your music is the best I’ve ever heard in my life that’s what drew me to Joyner so much. It’s crazy he really knows how to touch your heart. I cry all the time hearing I’m sorry and now this one too
I’m a recovered addict and a good friend of mine named Rachyl passed away a week ago. This came out at a good time. So heartbroken.
Real rap bringing true art back so good great job Lucas on another level
Best colab so good
We all wanted a JL n JR song. With Jellys history, Joyner was perfect to lay down a track with him. Bless
Like this if this made you kry too
Wow SOOO Powerful 💯Love this!
maan
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨
The only thing that worked for me was narcotics anonymous. I never thought I would lose the desire to use and find a new way to live. The therapeutic value of one addict helping another is without parallel. To anyone that struggles; You’re not alone, you’re not unique. Someone has gone through what you’ve gone through and are willing to help or point you in the direction of someone who can.
❤🧡🔥🔥
Spent over 7yrs in prison, 11yrs addicted to heroin, almost 5yrs clean! This shit hits hard!  Using addiction as a disease to basically do what you like! 🔥🔥🔥
Coming from an addict myself f what anybody say this song beyond amazing 🔥🔥🔥
Wish i had someone to help me through this😢
You are strong enough.. 🧡💙💚 Keep fighting!
2 months clean.. almost died Jan 7th
❤
This ain't just a song but a scripture
This song hits extra hard. I feel this in my heart
i wrote this as a response to another persons comment, but i figured i I might as well share it here as it might help someone somewhere understand it a little better. and if it does, that's good for me.  hey man, that's all you can do. i'm coming up on 7 years in recovery. I know how rough it can be for him. and on the other hand, being in recovery has given me an outlook somewhat similar to yours, though i pray i never have to fully understand what you're going through as i have an almost 5 year old son and 2.5 year old daughter.. but you can only try to set an example without making them feel like they're not understood or not important. it's like the normalcy of how one's brain works, how some might put it as "the old them," becomes hijacked from drugs and what used to bring them joy and happiness is now suddenly not important as the drugs are now what synthetically fuels the brains endorphins, dopamines etc.. on a chemical level, metaphorically, the brain is the factory, and all the usual characters like dopamine and endorphins are the workers employed there.. once a person becomes 'addicted' to a substance, particularly opiates, the substance is now synthetically employing other workers. Let's picture them as machines, robots, etc.. now when you start withdrawal, that's when the machines break down, therefore the brain is essentially shutdown and that creates a problem regarding the reward pathway of the brain, they become upset easily, angry and frustrated in the blink of an eye, and on top of it all they're going through withdrawal on a physical level, often misunderstood, and it's usually because people don't care to understand what's going on. they become antisocial and drawn away. usually this step ends up causing people to relapse unfortunately, being that the uncomfortable process of physical withdrawal is rough on the body, as is most substances alike, buts its def not the end of the road. if people are mentally ready, they can get through the physical withdrawal and then they'll start to feel extremely good, proud of how far they've come, which is when the pink cloud effect takes over. you feel like you have your old self back again and you can come to terms with what you did and how you've changed and you WANT to see that proud smile across your families face when they see you.. then the pink cloud phase ends, and something called PAWS (post acute withdrawal syndrome) comes creeping up, and this is, imo, the worst part of it all. this part is associated with your brain (the factory that's been shut down, so to say,) and fully coming to terms with the fact that it's been synthetically fed endorphins particularly and hasn't had to produce any endorphins itself for however long the addiction has been, be it 1 year or 15+, the longer the addiction the harder and more dragged out the process is, and it starts realizing it has to begin to go back to work after being "laid off" for 15 years or whatever.. it's going to take time, usually about 1 year, before your brain TRULY feels like itself again. there are times when you feel happy, rewarded, etc, but it's not essentially the same as the person who hasn't put themselves in the position of addiction. another big thing, and i speak from experience, but others might feel completely different, is arrested development.. it's essentially the brain not being allowed to "age" with the rest of the body, causing the person to usually act in an immature manner. i was roughly in addiction from 16-26, i tended to use more frequently when problems arose in my life and instead of facing them, processing them and dealing with them in the age appropriate manner, i "numbed" myself to not feel anything. unfortunately, your brain needs to go through those types of things in a raw, unadulterated way so it can "ripen" from those experiences, both good and bad, and what you get after going from 16-26 without the use of substances is a person who usually knows how to handle life's problems with, for the most part, dignity and in a mature age appropriate manner. sometimes people deal with things better and some worse. but using substances, and usually unbeknownst to the user, is not a good thing at all for the brain and as i mentioned before, oftentimes leaves a person who's for instance 30 years old, acting like a juvenile and once again misunderstood from many people around them. but because they don't know any other way to confront, process and deal with these issues, they in return feel betrayed or abandoned from whoever because they're just displaying what they essentially know on a brain chemical level and usually end up feeling defeated and the only thing they know to do is use at that point..  to not feel that pain, that hurt, that sense of abandonment, that misunderstood feeling. It's a brutal cycle, and honestly, a lot of people didn't sign up for all that mentioned above.. for me, i didn't understand what i was doing to myself in that sense, and it's taken a long time to become somebody i could feel proud of, but i eventually did. it's possible. you just need to want it in every part of your body, especially your brain. all anyone can do is be more open on communication, more open to not judging one another and trying to understand the next person as you don't know what they're going through, and being there for eachother as much as people allow. sometimes you do have to fight for what you love, but unfortunately, it all comes down to the person and how much they want to truly live. ❤
I am trying. But the pills and drugs and smokes are the only thing that be making me feel like I can be set free. I am sorry for what I become. To learn what it takes to be self love. I am sorry to the ones that I hurt. I had to learn the way I avoided my whole life. I am only human. My whole life felt like an alien because of how I treated. Now it's become how I treat myself. Wishing upon stars maybe someone could see the light behind my eyes. And maybe someone could see the real me behind my scars. I wanna write music, but I have a deaf father who matters to me. wanting to make him proud keeps me sheltered back, from my future. How can I make my father proud when I cry? And he tells me in a joking manner "everything is your fault, don't cry son" How can I stop. Myself from falling apart, from ways I become. From things I have thought, but never done. All my life spent trying to repent from things I was stuck in the worst prison of all. Nothing you could ever do to me, ever amounts to what I have done to myself inside my own mind.
@Joyner, you have hacked this rap thing. You're a legend. Damn Bruh!
I love this ❤️ this touched my heart
Come on mum I know you can get off the alcohol and other stuff I believe in you ❤
Damn.... This is deep! A lot of people can relate for sure!!
This hurts
This the type of Joyner I fell in love with
This shit gave me chills bro 🫡🫡
this is deep😔😔💔💔
Just a Deep song DAMM
I got on fentanyl bad in 2021. The night my baby was conceived I overdosed for the third time that year. That night was the last time I ever used. My daughter is now 7 months old today. I’m 16 months clean. Nobody but God. We Do Recover¡!❤️ this song hits different.🫶🏽
I love this song made me cry I can really feel that
This is the public service announcement we'll past due. WE'LL Done fellas.
Bruh this go hard!
My mom mixes prescription drugs with street drugs & alcohol. She’s not doing the street drug part of it as often but man it’s concerning. She’s a very good person & means well but addiction is real. She feels guilty about things all the time & the drugs help the pain she feels. I’ve been so scared almost constantly the last year or two. Addiction destroys families , hopefully one day we can find even better solutions for this crisis.
This hit home 😢
😢😢
Joyner could have use a lady because these days women do drugs more than men… we all have to save this Generation together 😢
Connected ka Litz adventure here
This is Joyner's lane. He is the purest story teller making music today. This is him at his best and I hope he never quits doing these multi-perspective stories. First song of his I ever heard was his song about Ross Capicchioni and I've been a fan ever since. Love that he got Jelly Roll on the hook too.
Unreal song an story  telling ❤
Already a classic.❤🎉
Joyner Lucas is the very best in the industry..the system doesn't just favor his type of music 😢
Who listen this in 2050❤
THEY SHOULD HAVE A TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️
As someone who works in behavioral health and rehabilitation, I love you all! Keep going. I believe in you ❤.
Such an amzing song... Really wishing Jelly Roll didn't use auto-tune
Damn .... This song. Broke me on another level. I've been addicted  to meth and fentanyl for bout 6 years now. It's taken everything from me except my life,I mean it's taken my life but leaves me still breathing .I guess is how I'd word it. My husband who I never saw my self without, I've been without him now for about a year, he's alive and living, raising our babies while I'm out here doing things I swore I'd never do. This is not who I'm supposed be I'm a selfish, drug addict and my kids and husband deserve so much more . I hated my husband for a while after he had me physically removed from our home and trespassed by the police ,fuck that shit hurt but now I respect him for making such a horribly sad decision. I was little by little taking my babies happy place and their home. I brought drugs and people who should never be in my home, I brought them into their safe place. I wish I could go back in time.I can't believe I let dope take my loves away. Damn.  I am so sorry if you read this Tyrone I'm so sorry,know I wanted to love you forever and I am so sorry for not being a mother I'm so sorry to my babies man fuck. I'm still here tho .
احمد مكى بتاع أمريكا (قطر الحياه)
Reminds me of when i cut my brother off cause he got back on pills. I didn't answer his call. All i got now is a voicemail. Pick and choose who you cut off. Shit idk but that's what i think
❤
This is truly mind blowing! Gave me chills!!❤❤
I seriously fuckin hate drugs 🥺
#LLA
Sent this to my ex husband
We won't change alone, but we won't change until we want to, such a hard conversion to navigate. #stillhere #demons
Maaaaan Joyner has done it again , making more bangers making his way to the top , bruh your a legend ❤
This is amazing and should be a #1 song!
1,218 days.. don’t give up. The world is a beautiful place and there is hope.
My big brother is a addicted and I really hope this song gets through to him and help his self because I really love him and I don't want to lose him to this damn addiction
Very touching 😭😭🙏
Man nun like being at work bawling my eyes out rn becauae this song hits home so hard rn!!!
I almost lost a friend to this shit😢😢
This was amazing
There are a few people I NEED to hug, in what's left of this lifetime...JELLY IS ONE😢❤
This song makes my soul scream. It’s beautiful. I’m five months sober but I fight the guilt of putting my family and loved ones thru this. One hundred percent I’m the second verse of this song. I got a lot of demons I fist fight every single day. But I be on all ten fighting em with everything in my soul.
Yes❤
Joyner should be the number 1 rapper in the world💯😔
This damn Joyner penmanship, creativity & storyline/subjects. Unmatched. 💪🏾🖤
Satan 😢u wrong lol
This video could been done way better
Was hooked on oxys then heroin for 8 years.  My family forced me into rehab back in 2018 and thankfully it stuck, ill have 5 years off that crap this May.  I wil forever be thankful that my family gave a damn about me, this makes me tear up cause i remember that first couple days off it, at the worst of the withdrawals my dad actually slept on a futon in front of the front door of the house to make sure i didnt leave to go score.  To anyone struggling with substance abuse, keep fighting man.  Its hard but worth it to be clean
I love this song.
I just lost my best friend, my soulmate, my everything!  to an overdose on 1/20/24!!!  Powerful song.....🙏❤❤
what a great Collab
If you love an know recovery is real, like this!🤘🤘💯🙌
Wow … just wow . I’m choking on tears right now . I wish I had the chance to send this to the people I’ve lost due to drugs and alcohol.. Addiction is real and it fucking kills man …. Ugh
Thank you Joyner lucas❤
Wow this was beyond powerful. Kudos brother
🔥🔥🔥 That's Deep!
I thought Joyner hated white people
Still trying to get to rehab  I keep saying it’s just alcohol   I can’t be in with those crack heads
This will live eternally in the music industry, give this one a platinum plaque right now... this helped me wake up and the smell the coffee in my situation... much love to Joyner and Jelly, they're the two most realest in the game ♥️ Joyner is a story telling master, nobody not even JCole is on his level... Joyner makes my top 10 all time favorite artist
March 2024, anyone? Lmao😂
Thanks both of you.
the best story teller in this generation. your music is giving life
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I lost my ex to overdose 2021. She left my son and I at the hospital for treatment when he was born. She died in bed next to her 8 month old daughter. I knew her 24 years. My whole childhood.   I don't know if I'll ever heal. I have our son. He's 7 now. I've had him since birth. I do my best to look out for his siblings too.   💔  She went through hell since we were little. Me too. We bonded for 20 years.   I hope she knows we were never mad and we love her. I made a scrap book of memories for the kids.   I miss her   💜
better than rappers dissing each other
🙊🙉🙈👅👁️🔻😈🤘🪐😜👌☠️🏁😴💤🐏
This song hit my core. ❤ #wedorecover
If this song hasn’t brought a tear to your eye then you don’t know what life is about. Mad respect Joyner and Jelly Roll 🫡🫡
I lost 2 of my best friends I’ve known since elementary and lost 6 other friends that’s were genuine people gone to way soon over the addiction. May God  help and bless them and their families and whoever’s going through it don’t give up hope… I’ve been off the cocaine for 4 months now going strong with my new job just started last week it’s finally looking up I can see the light now it’s like I was in a nightmare for 15 years.. I was on opioids for a couple of years & now it’s been about 5 years stopped doing all pills.. God Bless
Addiction is a disease and some people do use it as an excuse. I fight my addiction every single day. And I got 3 months clean. Some people may use it as an excuse but also some of us just need to be shown we are heard and cared for. Great song💯❤️
Yeah…
This is a beautiful masterpiece. Joyner is incredible, he saved my mom from getting evicted and helped pay her rent. This man should be protected at all costs and I bet we can all agree he’s a genius. Joyner your amazing 🥰
Love it ❤
🫶🏻
❤
WOW I FEEL THIS...
💯💯they spoke nun but facts 😢😢😢😢
One family torn apart from addiction is one too many. Put your problems down...just let them go.
This song is deep 😢😢
Dam love this song !
FTW
Wow this song hit home!!! Thank you Jelly role for being you, facing your self through it all and coming threw it on the other side sharing your strength threw music that transforms souls and generations!!! Thank you for your service brother and I'm truly proud of you!!!
My mom is so sneaky im not sure if she is going through something. But alcoholism was her drug. Shes sober for sum time. But life has passed her an  still does ...im not sure why but my sister is following her steps to becoming addicted to alcohol.  Im afraid. But i will learn to live . And be the best me i can for my family.
Almost 6 yrs clean. Already a fan of Jelly and now look what you did…..  Young man those words “I felt” both sides..
This was a great collab. Thank yall both for this
Joyner Lucas man you say it with respect and I dig that bro. Much respect 🙏🏻 to everyone fighting. Give you strength to achieve 🙏🏻
I Feel Like This Man Really Has Talent ❤ Definitely Going Far!! But One Thing About It, He Has His Own Story That Brought Him To Rap Like This And Continues To Allow Him To Keeping Bringing The Best Out Of Him 🥰
"If you get lost, then everyone loses"
I felt like you was speaking to me I been fighting this battle and losing this is the first time I have ever said this out loud I need help can someone please help me
😢
Ive been alone so long im harder to reach...is exactly how i feel n brings tears to my eyes everytime i hear it...
This isn't best for me a creep
Absolutely phenomenal job you guys. I hope this reaches anyone who needs to hear it
Damn, I teared up in the first 10 seconds 😢
This gon hit #1 in a month, it's crazy I used to be on the other side now I'm on joyner side so I understand both...
Nope, good message for people who don't understand. We all need love, addiction does just stop cause you want it to. Wake up people! Stop feeling sorry for yourself and help your son, daughter, wife, husband, partner, mom, dad, grandma or grandpa. Wake up. Listen to Tom MacDonald. Stronger Version. Get some love in your hearts. ❤❤❤
Wat a great song I have been there with my brother thank God he got clean 🙏🏼♥️
This song is beautiful hits u right in the heart ❤
"if you don't believe in yourself, you will never believe in someone believing in you" really hit home and how as an addict we don't see the value we have that others see. Living both sides of this ATM. This song is a banger and jelly roll was perfect for it
Always tappin in to your songs Joyner, reminds me of a friend I dont talk with much nowadays.. Anyway thanks for sharing your talent, and God bless you brother.
❤😢
Absolutely substance and fire messages from these two. Would love to hear them with Cee Lo Green on an album.
I love every single one of you ❤
This is the two best artist I've been waiting to collaborate 💯💯💯🐐🐐
“Deep”…..Sent chills over me,Reminds me of a family member who’s currently battling addiction….Stay strong RLW 💪🏽🙏🏽. Joyner preciate you bringing forward the awareness 💯
As a grown man, this song put me to tears, if you relate you relate. Joyner you’re one of the best on this planet, out here making real music.
Ah man, i cant hear that
I don’t know what hits harder this song or the comments 😭 Hope is all we have in times of darkness, I Hope everyone struggling finds the Strength to get clean and fix the relationship that got affected in the process of ugly addiction. My Dad has been clean for close to 15 years now I’m 30 rn and our relationship wasn’t always great to say the least but if he can do it and come back around and actually try and be the man we all needed than anyone can
this song hits on so many levels of addiction..from drugs to alcohol... great song to sad situations
This song deserves Grammy award fr🔥
Holy shit 😢😢😢😢😢
As a recovering addict. This song speaks volumes! ❤ so much truth in this song absolutely amazing!!!
Damn Joyner had to make me hear this today got me close to tears fuck man I'm an addict n this shit hit me hard!! Prayers up to those still struggling like me u ain't alone!!
To my cousin 😢

This song hit me so hard it brought tears to my eyes ppl just don't know the pain we hold in and the things we do in the dark ❤
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
I really need help ...understanding.. cool song but is this catering  to a community...like tyler childers..in ur love.. two men also 2024 whats going on why are we making this normal
God I need help
@JoynerLucasOfficial Keep puttin out that 🔥🔥🔥. Unbelievable music. Shit, I went n saw Joyner all by myself in philly💪🏽
You know Am not perfect at all I struggle with addiction with methamphetamine for 4 years I quit using by myself with no help. Then I got addicted to Adderall and Vyvanse for 6 years  I stopped using 5 mouths ago. And I have tried to take my life 5 times and and I have PTSD anxiety and depression and I am basically homeless I'm going to try to find a place to stay as soon as I can and I am lost custody of my kids to my estranged husband soon to be ex-husband that is my story I'm helping myself to get better with what little bit of help I have
This is why I'm going to school and I graduate in May, I'm going to help save ppls lives. I have a lived experience with SUDs and MIs so I know the feeling. I can't wait to try my best to help lead ppl to recovery and what works for them! I'll be listening to this song everytime I'm studying now!! Absolutely phenomenal song!!!
Appreciate this one Mr. Lucas 💐💐   Song is (GOATED) for life
Joyner is just different! ❤ that's all I got to say
🔥
Super deep. 😢
Thank you for the song guys! It's beautiful and makes me cry. I deal with multiple anxiety disorder and ptsd from friends committing suicide around me. I held one person in my arms when I found them ODing. They literally stopped breathing in my arms while I waited for the ambulance to get there. I have to tell myself every day that I can do better. I sadly am stuck on the medication that I have tried and almost successfully committed suicide with. I stare at those pills everyday and tell myself that I'm stronger than the anticonvulsant. It's a reminder that I can keep moving on in my life. Don't take the easy way out. Because if you  do you can't go back. You will hurt and traumatize everyone around you that you know. I have legally died enough times to know that I shouldn't have gotten as many chances at life as I have. Happy you put the suicide quote at the end. Should help anyone that may need it at that time. Keep doing you. The songs probably help more people than you will ever know!
Joyner does it again side note Jelly Roll might have a new career doing hooks for rappers
The world needs jelly and joyner now more than ever and all i can say about this song is just wow. Pure art
i had to leave my ex bc he wouldn’t leave meth. shit sounds so dumb. but it hurtssssss so bad bruh. i love him. he’ll never believe me though.
Songs, Finna stay on repeat someone struggling through addiction it’s so hard. Specially, since I got taken away from someone who was battling addiction on top of it the only parent that I had adopted me died when I was 13.
As a perk addict, this hits really hard and I know I need help.... It's hard man. Struggling with your own mind telling you not to go buy some more but also your mind telling you you need it to feel normal. I've been on em for years, and started to do really good at not doing em, then I got into a BAD wreck a few months ago and had them prescribed to me.  And it's been downhill since then.... I hate myself.. I love my son, with every bone in my body, but I hate myself for subjecting him to have a father that's depressed, and struggling to fight my inner self to do better.
Thank you for everything you do for us this song has helped so many strangers including me it helps to know we’re not alone🥺🖤💯
This song is hard. I keep praying for my Daugther. Nothing hurts more than to see your child drowning and no matter how much you tell them to stand up you are in shallow waters. They won’t listen and you have to watch them drown. I hope this beautiful song changes both views and provides an opportunity for communication. Thanks Joyner.
"I know you been callin for me, but I been alone so long, I'm harder to reach" That one hit different.
Was hoping Jelly dropped a verse too. Nevermind, you both did your thing. Great song! 💪
nice! https://www.youtube.com/@TheDoorToMore/featured
Holy shit joyner 😢
Josh Moore, I love you brother❤️💪
You really need to be stupid to tolerate this world sober... Stay high brother! ❤ Under influence, above ignorance!
ill be one year clean next month after almost 11 years of addiction. music helped me find myself again. i was the biggest screw up in my group of friends now im helping people that fell into addiction get clean. if i can do it you can too. biggest thing you have to remember is you are not alone. accountability of self is the hardest part of recovery
This is a fucking work of art..
Unexpected CollaB By 2 of my favorite artist & I love it. God allowed me to hear this song at the right time.  I legit needed to hear this today. I hope they win an award for this song/video... Thank you Joyner Lucus & Jelly Roll. Great joB directing too Joyner, I saw the Credits at the end. 👏🏾
I got goosebumps  hearing this I just got off the weed addiction  I had for a year
100%
🫡
Please pray for me I have a lil girl who depend on me and I’m fighting for through courts I need all the strength to get clean stay clean and do what I have to in order to get her back in to my life  I miss her and she misses me
Wow a song that actually had meaning. You don't get that alot.
Wow! I feel like most people can relate to this. When I was 14 when my dad overdosed and died. Then In 2016 I lost 4 friends. In 2020 I had to walk away from the love of my life, due to addiction as well. 💔 so devastating. The power of drugs. So much perspective from all the sides in this song! Well done guys! 🙏🏻🩵
I needed this today more than ever
This is a banger bro 🔥
Dam I needed this song ❤
I hear this song from both sides and understand it all fully. I am a recovering addict, I've been clean for 7 years. My children watched me destroy my life and myself and, although they were young adults at the worst of my addiction, I know it affected them greatly. When my son told me that his girlfriend was pregnant and I was going to be a grandma, I made the decision to get clean because I didn't want my grandbaby to ever know the "me" that was the addict.  Now, my son is adicted to cocaine. I can't help but blame myself for some of the hurt he tries to numb, but ultimately an addict makes their own decisions and I can't decide for him that be needs to quit or needs help. I want desperately for him to see that he's losing everything he has worked for. My grandson's are witnessing what I never wanted them to see. Someone they love addicted to drugs. My son is just the ghost of who he once was. I want him back, but he has to choose that for himself. I can only shelter my grandsons from the reality of life at the moment, but I can't always do that. Y'all pray for my son, please. He needs an awakening. I'm gonna send him this song. I know how it affected me when I heard it, I pray he hears what I do. Thank you @JoinerLucasOfficial for this look into the lives of those affected by addiction. It's a masterpiece. 💖💯💪🏽
This is epic  #SevenTheRev
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Another Joyner masterpiece ! Amazing work, that shit resonated so hard !
This is absolutely amazing!!!!!
I lost my mom to addiction when I was 16 and my father to addiction last year. I’m 30 now. This song let me think of things I’ve been pushing down for so long, gave me a second to feel when I thought I couldn’t anymore.
Growing up I never had a mom due to drugs and I'm almost 32 years old and tried and tried hoping she would change. Praying and praying she would just stay clean not just for me but her grandkids but she was to far gone to turn it down and now every time my phone rings I always have a gut feeling it's bad. Addiction is a disease and this song makes me cry! Me and her don't speak anymore I finally had to walk away but I will always promise to love her! I had to tell myself I'm not that little girl anymore she was never and will never change!!! Hardest thing i ever had to do was to walk away for good. So this song speaks to me everytime! ❤
FU for making me cry to this
You are the best brother! I've been listening to you for probably over five years now, even though I'm from Moscow! I produce Russian rap artists myself, I love and brew in this genre. In general, I'm for peace, all the best to you and your loved ones! Hugs to everyone and take care of yourself🙌
trash ass song
Thank you guys I'm crying I just lost my cousin to this crazy world because she got some bad stuff and it killed her 💔 thank you Jelly Roll for your fight on that 😢
I fuckin love you both ❤
🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥💪🏾✊🏾
I’m sorry 😢
This song hit so hard to the point i felt every single word. I am going through a very tough time with someone I love very much. I'm on the Verge of losing them due to addiction of alcohol. 8 years I've been by his side, and I know he's a good man. He's not a bad guy. He just does bad things.  And I pray God we'll make him the testimony i see in himself. Pray that his addiction won't win.
@trianajavar2821  I’ll be praying for you and your son sending prayers and good vibes best wishes ❤❤
I haven't bit up the courage to bring this up with my older brother... I'm enabling more than anything.... He needs me... I'm sorry bro i haven't done what a brother is supposed to do...
Dope. Blessed. #joynerlucas
Lost my best friend in 2016 to drug use rip kev 💔

I'm an addict and this song hits differently. 🎯
Joyner and Jelly. A collab I didn't know I needed but damn this hits you in the feels❤❤❤
Was not expecting to ball today.
I love this SONG 🎵
Bro I just saw you on breakfast club and trust me I really didn't know who u are because I rarely listen to rap music since I'm Jamaican....BUT I AIN'T GONNA LIE BRO! YOU'RE A GREAT RAPPER WITH GOOD/GREAT MUSIC.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The 🐐 is Back This And Eminem’s Untitled Upcoming Album Is Going To Be Albums of The Year 🐐🔥🥶
Shiiiiiiiiii 🔥
I love this song because sometimes u really have to leave ppl alone not because u don't love them but because they are killing themselves and not just with drugs. This is a great collab ❤
I’ve been struggling with alcoholism since my ex left and I barely see my 2 daughters but now it’s effecting ever aspect of my life 😢 I’ve been listening to this song on repeat been helping to motivate myself to do better for my kids ❤
After losing my brother in law of 10 years too addiction this shit hits hard bro much love!!!!
Beautiful ❤️
I learned to❤😢
I love that it includes both perspectives , it's such a accurate expression of both sides valid feelings and struggles towards this , beautifully and accurately done
I lost my father. I got him clean in 2012. He went to rehab. I gave him a place to come home to. We had a good 3 months. I saw a man who no longer lived in the shadow of his addiction. Then, he vanished. As I write this, I don't know where he is but I pray that he is safe.
I can’t win I keep trying to quit but it keeps calling my name it pulls me out this hell and into a lesser. Hell
Well this made me cry unexpectedly. My bf is 2 years clean and sober. He's 100% such a different person. He finally got help after his last relapse  when I stuck to my boundaries and had to let him go.  I thank God he made the choice to get help himself. It was so hard.  I thank God he's still here to be a good father, provider and partner.  Life does get better on the sober side.  ❤
@jellyroll and the rest who made this song!! You did it again!! I fell to my knees when I heard this song!! Very well said!! Needed to hear this!! Thank YOU!!!!
Jelly Roll rocking the shaqs!!!
❤❤❤
This song cuts so deep 😢 I’ve struggled with herion for 12 years and my fiancé is an alcoholic…..we love each other so much but we cause so much damage to ourselves and our families. God this song makes me cry so hard. Beautiful job guys
Clean off fet 6 years now been clean since 12/24/2018 🫡
The video man!
This shit just broke me down
I just celebrated 21 years (Heroin Free)  last August - take it from someone who knows - you can't make someone quit using unless they want it.
Helps so much keep it up we need you❤
❤
I pray 🙏🏾 my nephew get off drugs he’s only 24; his kids (1 & 3), wife & family missed the REAL you!!! CJ come bk to us healed in Jesus name!! 🥺😢😔 AMEN!!
Wow as an ex junkie, this hit home hard....me and my ex of 13 years got lost together....hes still lost :(
I need the "Fall in the Fall," Jelly back.😢
Classic ❤
There’s so many points of views. I have never done drugs. Smoked weed a few times as a teen. I am 26 and worked at a childrens psychiatric hospital for 5 years and a state psychiatric center for adults for 2 years. I’ve been on the end of dealing with drug addicts that most people don’t see. There’s so much mental to it. If you need help, find it, do it. There’s no one that can help you more than yourself, get rid of the victim mentality and find your peace. God, hobbies, friends, mental help, or the right medication can change your life. Make that step.
Incredible. Joiners new album is easily the best real hip hop album in several years
This makes me cry I think about my dads friend he passed away picked up the drugs again and overdosed 😭 he was a good guy and his addiction got the best of him
I used to be a alcoholic ...addiction is no joke...God bless, stay strong & shake that demon 🙏🏾
My little brother my best friend growing up got hooked on Fentanyl during the pandemic and we have drifted apart by miles. He tried to hurt my family and parents and I came from protecting him to protecting my family from him. My heart breaks everyday seeing the way things are now, I rarely see him he in them streets. We pray for him a lot even though we carry hurt from what he’s done to us. God pls save my brother.
This is the greatest video of ALL TIME.
This hit me hard 💔😭 Fvck... There's not 1 person who this song cant relate to! 💯 Thank you for this masterpiece Joyner Lucas & Jelly Roll!! ❤ 🙏🏼 Song of the decade!!
I lost my childhood best friend back in January. Drugs drove us apart when we got into our mid 20's. We had a lot of great memories though. This song helps me reminisce.
Fire 🔥
A much needed song for the current and next coming generation. Man, this shit got me to the feels dawg, good shit. Almost nothing gets me like this
Wow 🤯 this song hits on so many levels. I feel like this songs speaks on many types of addictions and relationships. Some people are addicted to drugs. Others addicted to depressions that drive friends/family members away. Some people don’t know when to let go and move on for fear of what will happen to that person they’re moving on from. Or better yet their selves 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
This song hit deep fr especially if drug addiction effect your family
masterpiece 🙏
❤❤thank you love the movement ❤❤❤❤I'm in a methadone program I have overdosed twice I have lost my family my friends ❤❤❤
I thought it was ceelo singing at first😅
After 5 years of struggling with addiction i finally broke through. I am a month alcohol free and it feels damn good to have broken from the chains of destruction.
This is the best song about addiction ever made and quite possibly the best thing ever written about addiction.
" if you don't belive in yourself how can u belive in someone believing in you. " wow, this line hit especially hard for me...
Bro hits diffrent always,great collab and great meaningful music.addiction is real my heart and love goes out to all.make good choices!
Powerful song. But I don’t understand why they show him with a bottle of prescription drugs. Prescription drugs are not what people are overdosing on or addicted to. And the government keeps regulating medication that people like me with horrific chronic pain need. They keep taking more and more away. I had a doctor butcher me up 9 years ago. I’m so crippled up from what he did to my back. And the government just took more pain medicine away from me. I’m to the point that I don’t even want to l!ve anymore because I am tired of suffering. The truth is they have the border wide open allowing fentanyl to flood into this country. It’s illegal drugs that people are dying from. Not accidental overdose from prescription medicine.
Anybody else notice that on the second verse Joyner couldn't hear what the man is saying to him? It's because those are the unexpressed emotions of someone struggling and can't say them out loud.
All his songs touch at least 1 person or home
Wow run this upppp number 1 let's goo
Nobody perfect not even JEWS so why you keep targeting me 🔥

Wow, wow, what can I say but perfection.
This would have sounded a lot more emotional if Jelly didn't use autotune.  His voice alone is amazing and can provoke emotion.
Best Song ever ❤️ Addiction is something that is real serious especially in this day and age. So many people have died from Fentanyl and it's sad
idk what's going on in this man's mind but his music is just straight genius!! ❤❤❤don't ever stop joyner, we need u!!
Beautiful

Deep

banger
Some of us do recover 🫶🏼 I'm steam rolling into my 17th month of sobriety. ❤ You really do have to hit rock bottom before you scramble back up. Here's some ♥️ to whoever needs it!! You aren't alone ♥️🙏🏻
I pray every day that today isn't the day I have to tell my kids their dad didn't wake up and they'll never see him again.
Deep. Soo deep. Thank you. 🫡
I'm writing this comment from my heart, I'd discontinued listening to Joyner Lucas when he 'evolved' after the ADHD album but listening to song made me realise why I fell in love with his music in the first place and this song reminded me of I'm sorry by Joyner ❤♥❤🔥. you've gained a lost follower @JoynerLUCAS. I'm back 💯🔥

Joyner is a fucking poet disguised as a rapper. Best of this generation.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm an alcoholic and I know the pain of addiction. My mom and dad both suffer with addiction. With both of them I have had to learn to let them go and it was one of the hardest things in my life.
joyner lucas, respect bro
My ex girlfriend was a drug user and it hurt I was there for her even when she was addicted plus being bipolar so far she's clean I think and I hardly listen to you Joyner Lucas keep it up first you got to colab with the goat Eminem and now the goat Jelly roll
I’m here for my comment in 10 yearssss

I lost my sister to her addictions. Then I married an addict. I have to choose me now.
✭ ✭ ✭ ✭ ✭
2 1/2 years ago, I found someone very close to me with an addiction, taking 10 opiates a day and on top of that five black agents a day. I noticed a change in their mood swing. They were always angry. We all moved back to Indiana as a way to try to save this person but this person went back to the drugs and had friends that were selling it to them I ended up missing money from the bank, turned out they were stealing from me, we were sitting and watching a movie he collapsed. I had to give him chest compressions to bring him back to life. I saved him February 26, 2023. I think God every day I still have this person. This song is home with me. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for you making this song. I have played this song for this person and it hit home with him too. He is clean now and I pray he continues to stay clean because I don’t know what I would do without this person in my life.

Who is the actor I'm thos video? I can't remember the movie he is in, but he looks familiar
19 yrs, 2 months and 2 days...  7,001 days....  230 months....  1000 weeks...  168,014 hours.....  10,080,853 minutes...  Since the last time I used methamphetamine aka Ice aka Speed..   FYI never with a needle  I wish I could say it's been easy.. But it's been anything but.. there are so many days where I wish I was still using.. I went cold turkey.. locked away in a motel room, alone,  after using it 2-3 times a day, every day for nearly 2 years straight .. was my way of coping with daily life with the kids father  I'm not wanting praise or anything like that.. I'm just putting this out there for myself to show myself how far I've come
I unfortunately was a 15 year old addict I slowly relapsing every once a while I’m 16 now I dealt with addicts in my life family friends all and I heard this song 10 seconds in I cried for hours
this song is fire! honestly his whole album. joyner makes me give rap a chance still..got that 2pac deep message rap..not just mumble bullshit...keep going kid!..reading the comments is eye opening as to how addictions reaches all touches of life..broke or rich..we all know someone..its sad that the human race is uncomfortable being sober..RIP to my brother and so many friends🙏🏻
Define hip hop that can make the world change. Artist and people juat talk but this right here is real and cone from the heart.
Hard lyrics but their not lying listen world this can nake change just listen. Joyner and Jelly Roll killed it damm too beautiful brings tears to my eyes.
Every comment here just know your loved and important. And you make a difference every day you live in someone's life.
WoW 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I just got out of detox this morning, and i been shittin and shakin on the toilet for 10 hours feeling like im dying with nothing but a notebook, a number 2 pencil, and the belief that making music out of my misery might someday be the catalyst needed for someone else to make the change to save their own life. It gets better. One second at a time, and one bar at a rhyme. You only lose if you quit fighting. Never stop fighting.
God bless you keep it up my brothers
How are you gonna handle 5.8 million pushups 💪🏼
Did coke and 10 years clean
🎉🎉🎉🎉
I pray for my dad every day now that I’m grown, he left when I was 5 years old I’ll be 35 this year and unfortunately he’s still has the same demons since I was little.  Even tho we don’t talk at all no matter how many times I’ve tried to reach out to him I just hope one day he’ll decide to get clean.
The best song EVER ALL I GOT TO SAY 508 all the wayyyy
❤❤❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lost my brother in law jan 30th of this year he was like a big brother to me he od on heroin rip brad #forever38
Hits deep addiction comes in so many forms. So needed this song more than you will ever know 🥺
This is going to be a anthem for a generation of kids who's parents and friends are addict's
Just got clean in 2020 did 16 years of this bs great song coming upon 4 years clean
I’ve been on many different substances and run down the road of addiction. I can openly say addiction is not a disease it’s a weakness. The choice of being weak or not is up to you.  I’ve been on weed many different pills everything from Oxy, Hydro, morphine Adderall hell I was tricked into smoking crack and used to snort an eight ball of cocaine every day for a couple of months. But now I do none of it but my problem is now I have to drink to sleep , otherwise my brain runs crazy, thinking of how many times I should’ve died or the fact that, technically twice I did die Anyone suffering from substance abuse if you can’t handle it on your own, there is help for you out there find it !!!! If you don’t believe that other people have it worse than you. Try me I have many more things I could tell you much worse.
I'M THE GREATEST
Wow... Just wow 😢 amazing song guys
Man..that fucked me up....
I'm about to send this to my brother and sister,this is gunn hit them like a ton of bricks
This song is so beautiful 😍 I hope that it helps the world 🌎 💚
😢 iv been sober 8years. But damn this hits. Hard. Thank you joyner/jelly.  Amazing 👏🏻
I cried this 1 man....this 1...thank you guys
This song and video are beautiful and i cried the whole way through
This song I cannot!!!!! it hits tooo damn hard ❤
Fantastic message🙏, also I could be reading to much into it but, does the newspaper clippings framed on the wall look like "The Punisher" logo/symbol?
Abraço de Portugal.
As someone who recently struggled with alcoholism and addiction and someone who have friends and family who struggle as well being a little over a month sober. This hit hard. Always love Joyner and I’ve just started listening to Jelly Rolls. Both men are beautiful human beings. Thank you both for your music and blessings.
❤
Man this just lets me know im not alone.. I got out of hell about 3 1/2 years ago. And ever since my best friend felt I left him alone. I’m sending him this tonight in hopes he opens the msg and listens to it. This should be song of the year. Thanks for this it’s truly just more motivation! God speed and I pray 🙏 that everyone who struggles with addiction can make it out of that hell.
Damn, Joyner is SO DAMN CLEVER with it! Always has been. The story telling and compelling dichotomy’s are MASTERFUL. Just wow.
lost too many friends from this shit, glad my ways changed. miss everyone of them daily.
Absolutely a beautiful song! Coming from a guy who now has a few years clean! I never thought I'd be a  addict and I never thought I'd ever get clean! Now I have 3 years! The streets of Philadelphia are a hard place! But I did it. SMH I thank God every day
R.I.P Allison. R.I.P Manny.
ugh I wish there was a resolution verse at the end. Song has no closer but it hit deep.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose my baby boy to this shit. He was sober but decided to be around addicts and started using again. And of course blaming everyone and everything else.  My momma heart can't do it again😭💔
Whoever reading this, God knows what you are facing through, he heard your cry, He is going to deliver you. Just trust in him. Amen. 💞
incredible! dont let the hip hop media fool yall to thinking its no good music anymore! thank yall for this!
Conscious Vibes 🔥🔥🔥
Been fw JellyRoll for some years now but when he went in front of Congress to help stop the fentanyl epidemic when he used to be part of the problem but actively pursuing being part of the solution speaks volumes to me.
Some of these comments really hit Different I am so sorry and I genuinely Love you all! We all will get through.... 🙏🏽💪🏾😔💛
The song makes me sad I lost my dad And a drug addiction he was in the military Jelly Roll I love your music
WOW
i'm a 24 year old addict of opiates (much love to my New England family, I'm from NH we've all been affected), amphetamines and anything to switch my mind up, because 1, I've been stupid but 2, because I'm in the 7th percentile with ADHD, not trying to escape blame for MY DECISIONS AND FAILURES AS A MAN, but I struggle with all the shitty symptoms that no one wants to talk about on social media when they're running their mouths about; "look at me i'm ADHD like Joyner I'm so quirky huh?"  this song represents every convo I've had and all the words I wish I said instead,  Joyner, you're leading a wave that's changing convos in rap and communities. you're saving lives with songs like this and I don't know How to say thank you...  I just hope I get to meet you one day so at least I can say it in person. sobriety is a fickle bitch! and relapses are part of the recovery process, it's not weakness you just gave the last of what you had, and not many can say that day after day! while really meaning it, and we all deserve to rest. I wish I could end this by saying i'm X years sober and proud! but I'm on the lethal limit (alegedly, i've done much more in the past) of my favorite amphetamine and want to hate myself for being back here after collectively spending years sober  in the last 4 years. but I know tomorrow's a new day, and this one was just too much for me.  much love to anyone who reads this, and sorry for the text wall lol. Best album 2024.
Dude addiction is the worst thing that happens to people every day I wonder when it’ll be over for ever😭
😢
Joyner is just 😍
This is the constant conversation I have with myself!!
Realy Relatable
Absolutely is a disease. Like cancer and diabetes.  Life choices
This song hit things I tried to forget. Miss my BFF from school but have to protect my kids first.
Holy shit. This is insane
Just wow speaking to my soul
my new favorit song.... so real   so right   so righteous
Grammy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
8th year clean from alcohol and heroin ❤ my son was born and it changed my life completely. He doesnt realize how much i mean it when i tell him, That i owe him the world.
Ladies and Gentlemen….. If anyone has ever been through something like this, this hit every emotion and thought that y’all ever had. This is a masterpiece. I have been 4 years clean and 2 in a half years sober. I have family members that are still stuck in this vicious circle. I thank god every day that I made it out and that I’m still here for my family. It’s so hard to help someone that’s not willing to help themselves even harder when it’s your own family. Just keep praying and have FAITH IN ALL PEOPLE. I LOVE Y’All life is too precious to spread hate and be judgmental. Much LOVE TO Y’All.
Fentanyl took my girlfriend November 1st 2016. I'm 3 years clean now after many failed attempts to join her
The awards and recognition for this go beyond music and theatre!  such a heartfelt heart breaking masterpiece
3 yrs clean in 20 days
This song is so amazing, I cried the first time I've listened to this. I lost my:Aunt, and uncles to drug and alcohol addiction. Thank you Joyner Lucas and Jellyroll for such an amazing song, I've been listening to this nonstop since my fiancè showed me this.
On my soul dis really made me cry dis way to real.
Love to all those who had that friend and are still trying everyday to battle that deamon! Reguardless be in a better place
😢😢😢❤❤❤😢😢😢😮😮😮😮
We all need to feature 🔥💯🌎🙌🙏
Joyner Really 👑🐐🔥🖤💯
i ve been on both sides and still struggling, i don't know what's the best for me and i think exactly the same as 'let god to choose'....😢
It was that sigh before the second verse for me
I CAN SO RELATE TO THIS  SONG KEEP  PLAYING  IT OVER AND OVER
I’ve been going through this struggle for longer than can be explained or understood and this songs brings me to tears and is powerful and makes me think about how change is possible. Thx Joyner and jelly roll
Beautiful song
Excellent job y’all wow definitely a time to write about this shit and face it
🔥
I don't know who needs to hearthis but drugs dont love you... we love you...
You have become my favorit rapper of all time
Soundtrack for 2024
The collab I needed ❤
11 years clean I forgot how hard it was I had  no help and felt lost if you are on drugs im here to say that your real self is still there he/she is just buried under it all and you can get back to it if your reading this I love you and I'm praying for you god bless I came back to add me and my wife did it together they said we wouldn't be able to but we did get clean just do it throw it down call your local spot its not easy but you can do it I miss my friends I miss my brother and someone we will miss you know that
I love this song. Anyone who has or that ever had a friend or family member who's battling addiction can relate. And unfortunately now a days too many can relate. As an ex user you can do anything you set your mind to and overcome any seemingly impossible addiction ❤❤❤
Amazing song, lost my brother to addiction almost 3 years ago, first verse was like my perspective, wish I understood his perspective. Really powerful
I'm not crying you're crying.
Thank you Sirrrrrrrr❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉❤
I actually cried singing this song cuz im battling demons and i feel like im losing the battle my suicidal thoughts are coming back😭😭😭
This and Macklemore’s “Otherside” remix version,  are the best songs I’ve heard about addiction. Just my opinion. Great job Joyner and jelly. Shit hits close to home
Stuck on oxy for years. Currently on suboxone. Don't know how I'll get off when I still have  chronic pain
When love isn’t enough 🔪💔
Bro, Jellyroll got a voice on him
If most of us open our eyes,2024 might actually be that year we have always been waiting for. Joyner has always been one of my fav poets ever.
My heart goes out to all the still suffering addicts❤ sobriety date 12/10/23
Fuck I wish I could explain what this means to me but the song doe’s enough
🙏 for  u  💔
awesome love it and cool
This hits home so hard .
I have been almost 6 years clean I used to be addicted to crack my wife and my kids showed me a different way to release my stress I’m proud of my self
I hate and love this song... Thats what makes it great! If anyone reading this need an ear lmk...
This is beautiful, I needed to hear this❤️
The tears that hit the floor are so loud 🥹
Powerful 💯
I'm loving this song. I didn't know we needed this but now I do ❤.   Shout-out to anyone who feels these lyrics.
Who played drums on this? Sounds like ?uestLove or maybe Steve Jordan?
Lost my brother and sister due to addiction. This song hit so much harder than I thought it would
I lost my my mom when I was 12 she died in 2016 thought and overdose it was the hardest drugs out there thank you for the song
This song brought me to tears as an ex addict of opioids and being clean for 5 years now my family is stronger than ever my wife and I both have good jobs and our kids have everything they need and more…. Your music makes a difference in my life every day keep being amazing and keep up that great music
joyner back like he never left
I been lost in my head 1:43 i want
I will hit my vape once for every like this comment gets
Still making songs that connect to so many souls 👏👏👏👏
A few years ago I started having seizures. I was in a void for 2 years and some time. My life isnt the same. I cry for no reason all the time, I cant remember anything. So much life has gone by and I have no clue what happened. The person that supposedly Loved me, Divorced me, took my son. And i have no idea why or what. Ive been texting her and trying to get some answers, she finally pick up the phone. "Im not your nurse, Im your wife, I should be getting paid or something." I woke up the other day, and they were gone. All i had was a note. "Sorry but I cant take care of you and our kid, we'll keep in touch let me know when your better."
I lost everything because alcohol and drugs 😢 i am lost
This deserves a Grammy 🔥
Slaps!
Just saw this. Tomorrow I'm celebrating 1 year clean from fentanyl and meth. There is hope for every addict. ##wedorecover
My daughter is 7 days clean  I pray everyone gets sober ❤
Best friend from high school overdosed awhile, ago if only this was published before he passed. 😢
Just lost a best friend to addiction, this one hits
this so good
Love you sososo much ♥️
As a recovering addict who's 5 & 1/2 years clean, this hits hard! I will never go back to that life and hope those that are still out there get something from this.
What deep is that as I’m listening to this song for the hundredth time I’m reading the comments and so I just want to put a prayer to every person going through something you have people in this world that don’t have your back you just gotta reach out💯💯💯💯🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Love is my drug…
I think this hits in every household around America and thank you Joyner and jelly because this is absolutely amazing
This dude done changed so much since catching some fame. Used to put on for the pill poppers, now you gonna shit on them? Those same pill poppers are the reason you are where you are today.
A collab I didn't know I needed to hear 🔥🔥🔥
Wowwww 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Jelly this is the real you.
That one dude got volcals💯
I had to watch and unfortunately lost someone extremely close to me due to addiction and of course the song is such a beautiful raw portrayal thanks for the masterpiece 🙌🏾 Dam near therapy
Made a grown man cry
Not bady you and Dax
I can hear Eminem’s song Beautiful in the background, “Don’t let them say you ain’t beautiful,” maybe it was an intentional sample of Eminem’s song and a crazy flip of it. It’s definitely a parallel in the lyrics and themes but different perspectives and a different take on it. Paying homage, and ushering a new era. All in all, it’s genius.
Damn good vocals jelly Good message as always Joyner  Third dude did it right as well
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
It’s a full circle for jelly with this one. From the song with lil wyte (pop another pill) to this masterpiece is on another level fr. ❤🎉
❤
Damn. This is a dope song.
Song of the year! Verse of the year!!!! Awesome job!!!
I lost my dad in 2022 to fentanyl and had to learn to walk away from my mother and step dad as well because of drugs and my mental health. It’s hard to see them battle everyday feeling like this is the life they deserve/ how they want to live to numb the pain inside. Walking away from people you love because of their addiction is hard for anyone. I check obituary’s and arrest record everyday praying I don’t  get the call or see an article with their name in it. Thank you and jelly roll for this song it makes me so emotional because I’ve never heard a song that describes both sides so perfectly.
This is the one 🙏 My boy finally getting his Grammy he has deserved for years !!!
Good job man, cam along way from that video about killin the kid. 🫡
He’s done it again!
You hittin my phone but I been alone so long I’m harder to reach…DAMN.
What a powerful song!
They are numbing thier pain. I really hope whom ever struggles with addiction to find peace. You gotta change people,places and things love ❤
❤❤❤
I really love how jellys curous. Is conflicting while saying go with the conflicting. I believe he is anyhow. The Joyner place the part of the addict and the fucking addicts crutch person. Super deep yall. I like this
Story  time... Good song an story
If there is a story teller better then Joyner or king von I’ll wait 😂
BEST SONG OF 2024!
2 of my fav! Been rockin with jelly and Joyner since day 1! Collab of the century! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow! ❤
what are we to do when individuals like the Sackler's do what they do and say what they say . It's so so so sad that so many problems were created for so many people to deal with for the rest of there lives. but the few that made the problem's for so many made  $10,000,000,000  off the lie that it was not as addictive as it really was and get to keep some of that money. what they did was much worse then someone selling drugs. sell drugs on the street lose everything and your freedom. sell a lie and provide new drugs for dealers to sell no real punishment. what they did seems way worse and more punishable then locally distributing drugs. The friend's i manage to have in my life are gone. I watched the Sackler's lie about a drug move thru my friend''s famialy's lives. One has passed from ODing and it was hard  to see everything that happened to them. I had to move on from having people in my life that had addition problems. Sackler's Why?
great song but the dude in the sweater was distracting
Excellent song👍🙏❤️
My best friend lost her battle with addiction. I couldn't help her the last time & it breaks my heart every single day.
Everyday seems like I fight a losing battle. I always hurt the ones I love the most.
This song made me cry. It caught both sides of addiction (the addicted and the loved one(s) praying for their sobriety/recovery that may never come). It’s a battle on both sides, and they both hurt like hell. Thankfully, my now husband has been sober from opiates for 23 months. He’s got a great job. We’re happily married. He’s not running from the police or his demons. Prison saved his life, but he put every bit of work in once released. I’m incredibly proud of him, and I hope one day he shares his story to inspire others. He inspires me and I have never touched drugs. If anyone is reading this and struggling with active addiction, you’ve got it in you. It takes one serious decision and a lifelong dedication. You’re stronger than you think. You are loved and you are worthy. But, as the song says, you have to see that worth in yourself. I’m rooting for you. Those of you that are in recovery, I’m so proud of you and all you’ve accomplished. I can’t speak on it personally, but I watched my husband go through hell multiple times to get sober. It is not easy AT ALL. I’m proud of you for seeing your worth, strength, and the life you deserve to have. Moment of silence for the loved ones we’ve lost to the battle. Never forgotten and always loved. 💜💔
What’s with the rammstein shirt?
Rough
And another classic from Joyner 🔥 Todays modern poet 👏🏽
This is what i love joyner, old school with this one, stay away from the babies
I love you Mom
💯
Almost cried thinking about my lil brother who's on fentanyl
Been clean from opiates for over a year now, although i had surgery on my shoulder in October of 23 and it was a hard ride but i made it out the other side, i need shoulder surgery on my other shoulder now. Its really hard waking up every morning to two budging disc in my neck and two worn out shoulders not to mention ive had surgery on one knee twice and the other once. But i still manage thanks to medical marijuana and suboxone. Its still a hard life but much better than before. I had gotten out of hand with the pain killers.
❤❤
Miss hearing from u been a min
Holy fuck... this is so deep. As a recovering heroin addict, over 10 years clean. Him sitting on the floor next to his od'd friend is an experience I've had way to many times.. this shit is beautiful, one hell of a song
This song really gave me chills. I am 3 in a half years sober. Amazing song!!
If you know someone that is addicted to drugs, alcohol, or pornography drop a like and let's see how many people are like me.
This sent chills especially when you lose someone to this. Wish the best for everyone who struggles with mental illness and drug addiction
True art. Masterpiece.
To everyone struggling through their addiction…. You CAN do it.  Everyone who goes through it has emotional issues they just DONT want to feel.   Dealing with buried traumas and emotions is hard.  My prayers and love go out to each and everyone.  God Bless ❤
I just celebrated 1yr clean and sober on 2/25. I went from being a hopeless dope feind alcoholic to a productive caring member of society. It's crazy how fast change can happen with just a little effort...if you're reading this and you struggle also. Just know it's not the end. You aren't too far gone...I pray you'll take that first step 🙏
6 years sober and this song hit my damn soul. It’s crazy what GOOD, thoughtful music like this can do to you.
Thank You Joyner! We Need You 💯🙏
Man my best friend got addicted to meth and is ruining his Life. All I can do is be there for him and pray for him
Keep your head up eye on the prize
Real shit! Been sober for years fuck drugs
Joyner!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤
This one hit home... STRONG song...  "If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you"
Truth
Miss you dado 😭
Awesome song you guys were the colab I didn’t know I needed!! 👏🏼🔥
This is my sister all day long. She's been addicted to meth and heroine for 23 years
This jam may not end whatever  war you're  going through but it can help you win some of the battles,through  , the process Peace!
I go to methadone clinic! After my dr.put me on heavy opiates for12 yrs.i went through hell but threw them away ! I lost over200 lbs! I got so sick then my daughter came and took me to her methadoneclinic
JELLY ROLL BEEN MY FAVORITE ❤
I love jelly roll I'd love to hear more from him! I play his songs over n over! He's awesome! I love the words in his songs! I relate to his words! 3:28
My son just sent this to me... about me. My clean date January 4th 2010. But still doesn't know if he can be sure. We live 1800 miles apart and just lost my daughter and his sister.
This song is Grammy worthy ❤❤
Yesss what an Epic collab❤💥🔥 on repeat!! I felt this.
Lovely
Joyner & jelly 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful song MY SON SENT ME IT TOUCHED MY SOUL ❤
I've been addicted for a very long time. I'm in rehab trying to do the best I can do. But I lost my brother last month to heroin overdose. Never thought I'd have to be in this world without my little brother.  Songs like this help me remember what I'm fighting for and what my brother list his life for. Thank u

We just lost my husband and my boys father to addiction the day before this was released   We are broken
I come from a very long line of addicted. I was an addict of many different things over the years. I don’t care who you are, It’s a choice not a disease. No one wants to get clean until they want to. It’s a choice you make when you raise your head out of bed everyday. You can choose to sober up and do right. Or you can choose to stay an addict. What will it be for you?
❤ ive fought addiction and had a love one fight it after me and this song hit my soul. Thank both of you for this amazing song!!!
So deep, sending a prayer to my mother in hopes of change before it’s to late 🙏🏽
🔥
Famous last words💯😢
Just lost my best friend my day 1 from an od and it hurts. This hit on some many levels its helping to ease the pain but I'll live with this pain forever. I miss u my brother.
Wow. Thank you. 💚🙏
I had a cuzin pass away from xanx addiction he was the greatest person I swear seeing all these comments man I hope everyone’s addicted family members, friends , or loved ones make it out of this hard ass battle 👌🏻💯🙏🏻
I'm  hope you're son does well but watch out for him thier vonerably at first when sober the resistance to the drug is real slow in
This song felt like it was for me I struggle every day with substance abuse I never thought I'd be this person... please pray for me 💔🫶🙏
I’ve never been involved in that life, but have had alcoholics in my family. God bless you all for reaching down in your souls to help those people find a voice. To all those who testified to deliverance, so happy for and proud of you. To those who are still struggling, it ain’t over till it’s over! Grab hold! 😭🥰
Joyner always does both perspectives. Beyond powerful for the message. Helps us to see both sides and it makes us open our minds
This song made me cry, && even more so the comments. We have so much love for those who we want to help and change but they don’t see it like us.
🙏🏽🙏🏽
Jelly roll is so haunting
With love from North East India
As a father and 9 years sober this is unbelievable
To me, from future me.
And yaw gonna act like this mf aint a legend already idc what anybody says.! This shit is the Joyner I like to see frfr .!
Masterpiece
Yo that shii was 🔥💯
sheesh🔥🔥🔥. Also Bravo to the guy lip-syncing the final verse. He increased the amount of ralate to the song.
My ex Fiance sent this me the other day... idk how or why I got hooked into shooting up heroin. But I'm 28. An I am. I'm snorting 4+ grams of coke a day. Shooting up 5 times a day. I'm ignoring my family since I left. I said I'd get clean an turn it around to see them again.. right after I told her that. I shot up again.. addiction sucks. I never thought this would happen to me.. here I am. Up at 6 am to get high. But I listened to this. An I thought, maybe I'm stronger.. idk if I am but I'll never kno until I actually try. So I flushed my drugs. I'm gonna try.. really fucking try!.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
damn joyner really got the Caseoh collab, crazy song go nuts.
A need a Eminem NF and Joyner song before it’s over
🎉
It reminds me of my mom
I have lived with addiction for over 25 years. Between the Oxy, Lortab, Vicodin, Roxy, and the fuking endless list of opioids I have drowned my self with. Now I am in the "programs" for suboxone. Just another government legal dealer and trap.  All the relationships I have trashed, the family I have hurt needlessly, all the way down to my children I have let down and hurt. This struggle feels like its a endless cycle of darkness. If you can escape you are my hero...  This song hit me hard. Keep up the amazing music! <3
4 years away , from going through this , been a long road , still fighting .
My sister was stuck on heroin for a while. Fentanyl took her from us in 2019. Joyner really does help man. 🥺
Damn boys! This one a real one! Thank you for all you do and the beautiful music you create!
JOYNER OVER DRAKE ANYDAY❤⚠️
Why you let all the talk about the big three go, you as good and better than some
So I thankfully have never dealt with any of my loved ones having an addiction… but this song legit hit my soul so hard and reminded me how blessed I am… I am crying but so grateful this music video was made!!! Beautiful job ❤
been sober from heroin for 6 years in may. but iv'e been struggling these past days. thank you for this song, my better side of my brain needed this ❤
Shit made me cry 😢
Almost 16 years sober, this one hits hard....
Somehow speaking for millions of people 🔥
🔥 🔥 🔥
So touching
🙏🏻  ❤
Thank you so much for this song. It really helps put things in perspective. Going through this with my mom. 😢
No one talks about it but to all those struggling with marijuana dependency you CAN find happiness without it.
Welp broke my heart again
showing both the sides of the coin is exemplary. This shows in general how broken we humans are at some points of our life. Stay strong All.
This isn’t number one why ???
Yesterday she had one year clean!!
I fight my addiction everyday. I've been clean for 18yrs, everyday is a blessing to be alive and free, everyday still a struggle,, ❤ Thank you this video means a lot,,
Can i have that Zeppelin tshirt please
SOLID. Had no idea JR be singing 🤷🏽‍♂️😎
❤❤❤❤
I was in foster care by the time I was five moving from to place even there I suffered abuse eating of of dumpsters living on the run my mother overdosed and died of of a broken heart and my dad who was supposed to be there for us was a chomo I’m still fighting to keep my head above the water I can’t even read the adoption files bc people still hiding stuff from me they won’t give me the truth they threw me out when they couldn’t control me now they cut my brothers out of my life and act like I don’t exist
7 years clean for me next month.  I dont usually comment but I felt this in so many ways, they both killed it. Joyner is a great story teller, I love how he speaks from both sides. We need more of this type of healing music,  It touches so many people and can literary save lifes.
When I first heard this song i cried my eyes out!!! I was a addict for 20 years.... My mom got clean 15 years ago from a biker life, my dad is still a alcoholic (even tho he knows it). I kept tryin to get clean but kept going back. My ex got clean and she begged me to get right.. this last run i got clean and was diagnosed with HIV from sleeping with a chick... My whole world just completely crashed to the ground.. I let fentanyl and meth take control of my life and it made me loose every lovable piece of me.. now i have 11 months sober and i feel like right now is the hardest part.. worse than the beginning.. people tell me "you don't have a disease!" FORGET YOU!!!! TO ANYONE WHO SAYS THAT HAS NO IDEA!!! I keep pushing myself everyday and most days I wanna just give up... To anyone who reads this and you just need to hear this..... I may not know u but I love you... You are loved and please dont give up 🙏🏼💯🥺😞
My sister has been addicted to drugs for so long. and i have ignored her out of my life. Didnt care about her and didnt ask my parents. This song broke me, i can't even remotely believe im going to talk to her now because of this one song.
Damn….
This hits wayyyyyy deeeeeeppp🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
9 months and 3 days clean!!! Thank you God!!
Me my dad and brother all got caught up on drugs, I met someone who tore me away from my father for my own good, had a little girl with her, and my dad went to bed one night, excited to see his granddaughter and son in a couple days and never woke up. He wasn't trying to kill himself, but his demons won. My daughter mentions him when she only met him as a newborn. It chews me up every single day
was clean for 2 years but relapsed last year... my life is currently spiraling and i know the drugs are the problems to my struggles but its my escape that i cant seem to escape :/
I am 36 days clean. Drugs take and take and take from you, believe me. It takes you from you, your family, your desire, it messes life around, more problems, it doesn't get better. I am a Survivor. ❤
Hits different
311 days clean, this song hits home man.
17 years I've smoked cannabis. This year I'm fighting to stay clean. Wish me luck its harder than most think I've trauma I'm masking. I need to learn to be happier without
This chorus slaps
How are people sleeping on Joyner though.... always dropping beautiful music music.  Fire
This shit is deep. I love it! ❤❤
Beautiful song hit me hard. 12 yrs clean and I fight every FKN day! God bless!
Christians are brutally judgemental.
874 days sober today.  The first time i got to know the real me was when i got sober.  A new mind and a new life has taken shape.  I failed many times but this time, i got it.  If anybody is reading this who is struggling with addiction, you can do it.  Just keep trying.  You're not broken.  Persistance will get you there.  You're worth it.
Mm...this shits deep....speaks to your spirit...
I have issues. And my girl left me after 11 years, right when I needed her the most. She was my whole life. 42 years old now and for the first time, I don’t feel like I want to get better. Honestly, I don’t care if I disappear. But, I’m the oldest of 5 and they all looked up to me…until now. I don’t remember who I used to be. And I’ve lost everything. No car, house, nothing. She got her doctorate and left as soon as she landed her first real job. Life is hard. I wish I had a 2nd chance but this hole is way too deep.
Legendary 🔥
Fuck man you got me fucking crying… fuck man, rip to all the homies I’ve lost to addiction. 💔
I got clean but my brother is still in that dark place and I struggle not going back all the time. God I needed this song so badly. I wish I could reach him with this and let him just know how much I love him and want him to be in a good place for once in this messed up life we’ve shared like so many others.
this is crazy
Prayer of Salvation to The Way The Truth and The Life:   Repeat after me and agree with me In Prayer to the Savior of the Whole World the Son of God for where two are gathered in his name he is here with us.  Jesus Christ of Nazareth, I want to be Born Again I want to be Made New, I want to Have Eternal Life through You in your Kingdom. I Repent of my sins.  I confess You are Lord with my mouth.  I am a sinner, I am sorry that my sins caused you to suffer on the cross. I Ask You to enter into my heart enter into my life change me and save me  from all my sins with thy Blood which was shed for me on the Cross and for thy Body which was Given By God to me to save. I Drink thy Blood and Eat Thy Flesh. Renew my Mind, Protect me, defend me Lord God. You alone Can save me. Amen.
Jelly is a goddesses
Peep the RAMMSTEIN shirt!
Hits different fss💯💪
This shit hit me so hard. Love this shit.
Black guy is the disney hero father, pretty obvious who put this one together
on GOD
February 10th, 2024 - my brother Jackson - the fella who taught me to rap, bought me all my hip-hop albums, helped raised me majorly, and was my the person I wanted to be like for so long - overdosed using heroin and fentanyl.  Wish someone found him sooner and was able to save him.  Powerful stuff, Joyner.
God bless you
Woohoo listening to this song again and again and again and again 😍 🔥🔥🤙
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
🔝💯🚀🛸👽🧘😊❤️🍁 Thailand
This song is just special 😫
Glad someone is still dropping this type of music 🤝
Too many weak minded addicted people making excuses. Its a choice you chose to be weak and run from the world with drugs.
This hit my life
This is a masterpiece...it's gonna blow up...props to you and your brilliance
idk anyone, personally, addicted to drugs. i don't think so anyway. but this song hit my SOUL, the FIRST time i heard it. wtf joyner 😢❤
Oh ny god… wow Joyner this is your best work yet 😢😢😢😢
So this is a song about ppl not smart enough to know not to do drugs that have a high chance to kill you?? #morons
I wish we had more random collabs like this in music! This is one collaboration I did not know that I needed til I clicked on this video! 🔥🔥🔥
WOW...
My little sister is only 19 addicted to fentynol and overdosed over 10 times. Idk what to do everyday is panic mode for me.
I don't care what nobody says, but Joyner is better than Drake, Kendrick, and Cole.
🤍 🖤 🤍
I ❤
this is where joyner shines. this album wouldve been perfect till i got to the pig song and the cliche victim card was played.
🤍🙏🏼✨️
Just the medicine the doctor ordered
FLOP. Joyner is so underrated it’s sickening. Two of my my favorite artists I was expecting more…
From SA🇿🇦. I love this masterpiece 🥃🍾.
As a Massachusetts native, Joyner is the only guy to make it out of mass in the music industry who is “real”. The other guys like benzino and millyz are frauds.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥I don't see anybody else singing the hook.. Jelly Roll 🔥🔥🔥
WOW!!! This one hit a little different these days 💯
Only joyner can keep rhyming ME with Me and make it sound dope af
I was on pills, meth, coc and a little H for 4 years. Methadone for 11. Now im finally free. Cigarettes are next
Fuck man...
Powerful
Joyner and kendrick need to make an album together 💯
Absolutely WOW!!!! Both of these guys are sensational but I've never really heard jellyroll sing like that and omg he just blew my mind. This man can do no wrong,he is such a talent and at the same time his lyrics and message help so many of us along the way. I can only speak for myself but so many of jellyrolls songs have touched me deep down inside and helped me more than words can explain ❤
This is so deep joyner your the goat of deep meaning songs man this hit home for me coming from a person that was dealing with alcohol addiction man this makes me wanna cry frfr 💯
Thank you✌️
I have an aunt that I had to cut ties with because all she can see is a pill bottle and my heart hurts everyday because of it. I’m not religious but I pray everyday that she’ll find her way back to us someday. 💔
Damn Lyrecs hit me Soo deep.❤👏🔥
We love you here in South Africa 🇿🇦
REALEST SHIT IV EVER HEARD cause i can relate to the pain an addiction this is a REAL ONE BLESS!!!!
Damn Joyner, you've done it again!! Song after song of important and profound meaning. Im 39 and was an artist myself at one point. I've been an absolute hip-hop die hard, pretty much my whole life, and I can tell you, you're one of the greats. Thank you for what you do.
Joyner making dope music again
Jelly music never ceases to amaze me and bring me to tears this one hits different
Amazing!! This hit me hard!! Thank you for doing what you do and thank you for caring! My son is only 19 now almost lost him 7 times to fentanyl overdose! And I couldn’t imagine life without him! This song helps many many people again thank you!
Not being funny but this reminds me of the episode when SpongeBob looses Gary and the song Gary Come Home is playing 😭😭😭
Why does jelly roll look like 3 of my bodies put together
Joyner Lucas slayed this shit....one of the best songs I've heard in a while in my opinion.......I'm a addict and this song really hit home...and the way he did it coming from both sides of addiction was great and of course jelly roll singing in it when he is one of the hottest singers out right now....great job
This song broke me down
My fathers favorite artist is Joyner and he’s a drug addict I pray he hears this
Damn, this message is STRONG!!!! Fuckin Solid ass track. Love it 👌🏻👍🏻
This is not a song this is an emotion
Joyner does it again. Also, Jelly’s vocals sound amazing.
Love both artists and didnt ever think about them doing a collaboration but so glad they did this song is amazing 🙏🙏🙏
🥺WoW!!❤️‍🔥 powerful!
this is hard 💯the words cut through deep . the act on this is amazing You did that 🔐🎥🎉
How the FUCK am i on day 3 again. Fuck...
I have seen multiple family members friends go through this and this is how I feel most of the time now and I’m scared for the future
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn this really hits hard. Im going to have this song play for a good while.  I just discovered this song just 3 days after my  friend passed away.  R.I P Pancho. You're in a better place.
Thank you for this 🙏🏽
This brought tears to my eyes much love  @JoynerLucasOfficial and @JellyRoll for this I’m a recovering addict just under a year of sobriety working a program of CA and thanks to god I have the power to carry the message to the addict/alcoholic that still suffers🙏
This song is deep.
Good shit ❤
This hit home 😢 struggled for years finally lost my kid and got clean to get her back and lost her dad to OD  . #ADDICTION KILLS
😢 Jellyroll is making a movement and we need to protect this man at all costs. He's come a long way from hanging dry wall.
Awesome song 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏
This hit my soul love both of u fellas music ❤
This is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fall asleep in 15 minutes —— https://youtube.com/@rayneonmi
love your story telling ❤🙏🏼
nothing better than an artist truly explaining a story through art. nothing less than beautiful work
Such a good song. God bless Joyner
😔😔😔
Jelly roll que voz irmao! Primeira vez que conheco vc e ja curtir sua voz! Esta de parabens e ainda fazendo parceiro com o grande Joyner ! Que musica! ❤
This is the anthem of millions of broken homes, millions of kids who needed a parent that was taken by drugs 💔
7 years str8 here , 1 day at a time !  Custody of both of my kids for 5 years from a prior marriage. Still hit 3-5 meetings weekly and enjoy just helping others (12th step) Needless to say the promises came true in my life and they can for you too..❤
I'm literally pouring tears right now! Me and my fiance both got hooked on pain killers about 3 yrs ago! It got bad! I finally decided to to talk to God and ask for change and strength and he gave it to me! I'm 1 month clean and I'm eating healthy and fasting! But I'm literally hurting for my fiance! She can't seem to find it in herself to make that change with me and I see it tearing her apart every day! I'm here to tell anyone out there that's going through this that there is a way out! You have to manifest on it and pray for it and truly believe in yourself and just do it!!! God help all in need! Thank you jelly roll and Joyner Lucas! The world needed this one bad!!!!!!!
As a former addict / alcoholic, this song speaks to your soul. ❤ Joyner & Jelly just saved some lives with this one. The way Joyner wrote from the position of the addict is so powerful. Share this song to every person you know struggling with addiction & alcoholism ! Might just be the one thing they hear and see to send them to get some help. Offer them a ride ..😢
To all of those struggling with addiction. You have to want to get better first.
this the shit that should be winning grammys not sexyreds thot music
9:15pm I'm watching this amazing video thank you, I appreciate you for telling your story because we have a story, God bless
The most depressing music ever 😆 🤣 😂
Hip hop needs more real ones like these fellows ❤❤
I wish my girl Cortney could've heard this before she lost her fight last April 17 a day after my birthday 😢😢never forget the addicts dead or alive.  We all Have a story and to those who are now sober if you dont hear it I am proud of you! It takes grear strength to come back from the bottom Pat yourself on the back and look back to move forward and if you need to reach out do so❤❤❤❤
What’s the guys name that plays the addict?
Lyrics ❤   🤘
This song is 💯💯💯💯💯
Omg jelly that voice is amazing ❤❤❤❤
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL
Powerful just powerful hits me in my soul
Jelly Roll and Joyner, I'm in.
All praises, I hope your friend hears this brother 🙏🏽 I HATE these terrible drugs that people get addicted to. Praying for a sober sound mind for those who want it
Good subject and artwork and humanity help, but with all respect need to correct the definition and misunderstanding of addiction because eating and drinking attitude of addicting too and necessary to have energies and power to daily living and should focus on helping and educating the ignorance of use in anything not just drugs and food, drinks. Etc.., Between you rock and keep up the good work men🏀👌
Big Witt Lowry style vibes here and that’s a dope thing. Absolute banger.
That song is an absolute banger on so many levels. God bless this world were in!
Who produced this song? ❤
This is how we want to interpret Hip--hop verses. Thanks joyner for the joy of lyricism
This sounds like the conversation DMX had with his son. Were his son is begging him to get clean or he can't be around him because he doesn't want to see DMX killing himself and DMX says he ain't and that he should accept him as he is now and at the end tells his son to see him at his funeral. While his son just cries.
Dam. This hit Deep.  Like really really Deep. Been through this many times. 9 yrs good now 👍💯
Good track
😭....
🙌🏼🙏🏼 I pray for my mom everyday, because tomorrow may be her last day
KISS
How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  Yeah, I got somebody I love (yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (woah) But I wrotе this song in hopes when they'll hеar it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it enough (woah) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and you makin' feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (do what you might, woah) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (lose it) And you wan' deny all about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and he ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me  How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  Look, I know you been callin' for me (yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long, I'm harder to reach (joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (uh) How do I look go of something I know is something is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's he's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, I'm tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me  How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?
this song just saved my life
this is a beautiful song i appreciate the song and the message keep going!!! ❤❤❤
I love you so so much. SOUL FAMILY FOREVER🫶🏻💝🌌🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
I've been clean 11 years from heroin it was a dark time then its been hard since.
The way you can tap in both sides to every story is truly a gift and I hope you never stop making music like this
My boyfriend and I broke up today so much mental and emotional abuse I stayed for 14 months and couldn't do it anymore. 💔  I'm broken this song hits hard
If i can find my mom ill show her this. if it makes me feel the way im feeling right now to comment on this, then i pray it helps her because im not who i am without her. This really hits hard man
Somebody's got to know that's not really jelly rolls voice.
Just hit 7 years off alcohol wife 5 off opiates. 2 kids. We made it. Still gotta keep that bottom in your back pocket though. ❤
"How come you are only there for me when I'm trying to get cleaned"
Damn this song hits as an addict
Much as I need you I would not be sticking around or watching you rest in peace.❤  That hit hard.😢
This entire album is gold ❤

Just to clarify an addiction is not a disease. It’s a choice people that have cancer didn’t choose it.🔥🔥🔥🔥song
Been clean almost 2 years now this had me in tears 😢
You were a voice for so many the way you give 2 different perspectives is unmatched and they way jelly ties it all togeather is soooooooooooooo amazing. Thank you kings!! And i hope everyone is able to heal from whatever they are going through!!!! Remember you are all loved
Jelly is SO beaat! G.O.A.T him and Eminem are both by far my 2 favorite rappers!!!
Here for jelly roll ❤
This hits home.  My wife had a drug problem, and I never saw it thru her eyes.  The perspective is a hard hitter.
This is classic
Hey loves. This is a love letter for anyone addicted to drugs. It is not the drugs that is the problem. The problem is a spiritual, relational, mental, and physical one. I love the outcasts of society. Sometimes I feel the most peace and understanding around them. My demons play with their demons and sometimes we have the funnest times. We tell funny ass stories. We tell each other our inner darkest secrets and feel connected,  we have some of the hottest, sexiest, wildest sex. And when I can't handle my life, I submit and let them control me. That's toxic relationships and trauma bonding. And the flip side is yall can trigger the shit out of each other, manipulate, and point out weaknesses, and destroy each other over arguments or shitty situations. People use drugs to escape, party, boredom, etc. Just like people use all kinds of other things. Social media, porn, video games, food, people etc. If you want to be free you have got to stop playing the victim and giving your control up. Stop giving it to professionals, programs, rehabs, family, substances, etc. Be willing to be open minded and desperate. Try everything but be smart about it. When you call bullshit, don't get mad. Politely say this is not for me, and try something else. If you have extensive trauma history where a man has violated you. Ask if they have a female provider. And vice versa. You are all very smart, creative, and funny people. You just get stuck in the lies and bullshit. You come from families that didn't teach healthy boundaries, or emotional, or you  regulation,  or you got into a program, church, rehab, psych ward, jail, prison etc. And someone used their authority to violate you and control you. And when you spoke up, they lied about you. Maybe you even got kicked out because of it. Deep down you have a longing to be loved and safe. I get that. I relate. But baby. Your not going to find that in a substance, a person, a program, etc. Your going to find that in you. Your going to have to take one step at a time. And baby that is painful. I get it. But you don't need jelly rolls song save me. You don't need a man or woman or program to save you. You need to open your eyes and be honest with yourself. Quit speaking lies about your life. Yes u were hurt and it killed you. So much that u can't live anymore. You can't cope anymore. And you just keep hurting the people around you. You keep hurting you. Some of yall got blessed with kids. Some of those kids are in the system or on drugs. You might not believe in God. But something or someone helped make a kid for you. And you were blessed. That kid needs you. Let that be your therapy. Fuck dad and mom. Uncles aunts whoever messed with you. Be the parent that you needed. If you need to use your kid as a crutch to start the change, that's fine. Take it one day at a time. And eventually it won't just be about the kid. It will be about you, your kid, their kids, your work, your family, your hobbies, your finances, your talents. Maybe one day you can even use your story to help others. I've been married to two drug addicts, one was a felon.  I just got out of a traumatic relationship with a drug addict and felon. I use those labels because that is their past. I loved these men. But I had to leave all of them. Because they were abusing me and killing themselves. My second husband wrote books. Robert gallant vodka vagabonds and victory. When I met that man he was living in a halfway house. Just got out of prison.  The first week he knew me he told me he was going to marry me. I thought the man was ugly and short. Lol. He had nothing to offer me. But the thing about me was I love God. But because of my past as a severe trauma victim of men, and my time as a prostitute. My drug of choice is men. The more messed up the better. Lmao. I go into captin save a ho mode. Like my ex said. And I'm wiling to lay down my life for the man I love. I let drug addicts and felons in my home. In my finances. In my heart, soul, body and mind. I sacrifice myself because I know the pain behind those eyes. I see the guilt shame hate when they use drugs and are aware of the consequences.  My second husband Robert had sobriety for 10 years. But his body and life was so fucked up, that my man lost his life to alcoholism. He came to me with hep c, cirrhosis,  mental issues, anger issues, criminal background. And he lost his life on my daughter's birthday. Funny huh. The doctor told me even if he didn't go back to drugs he would have passed soon anyways. He died in 2021 and I gave up. I let the psych Dr's have me and pump my body full of drugs and label me ptsd, bipolar, borderline personality disorder. The funny thing is yes I probably have some of those diagnosis. But that is not a death sentence. Just think of it as a personality and figure out a way to manage it. He died in 2021 and in 2024 I was in a program for human trafficking and strippers. I was so spiritually abused that I was convinced to go off psych meds and this mentor who was supposed to just love on me and teach me the Bible instead did hard-core deliverance ministry on me. I actually knew her as a friend. So she knew my story. But that was not her role. And she traumatized the fuck out of me. Not to mention the program gave me a shitty therapist and I made my boyfriend sign up. The people that had authority in those roles over me and my boyfriend could had done very bad harm. I could have killed myself, he could have hurt me, or himself, or he could have used hard drugs. You have to use programs, people, gurus, etc in authority positions with a grain of salt. If you feel their bullshit or feel unsafe you have a right to speak with someone above them. You habe a right to not take medicine or disagree with them. Sometimes they might get mad and try and lie about you. You have to keep your emotions under control. Read about borderline personality disorder and providers. Some providers hate treating bpd people because they are hard to treat. Lol duh. It's cause they recognize bullshit. Some of yall are hustlers. You got game. You got skills. You have street smarts. You have to learn how to use that in the correct way and you will get your point across. If you take drugs and become in psychosis and end up in the psych ward. Don't get scared, chill. Play games in your mind. Listen to the sounds and stories of the other patients. Don't let it scare you. You are in a safe place. They just want to make sure you are not going to hurt yourself or others. Come down from the drugs and be honest. You don't have to go into a long history. Short and straight facts like I got really upset and got high and I guess it was laced. Psych doctors don't need to know your life story. You aren't going to be in there for long. And if you are homeless stop using it to sleep. Lmao. I pissed a medical dr off and he backeracted me for 12 hours. It took them 12 hours for me to see a psych Dr. That's ridiculous.  But while I waited there was a man on drugs. And he was crying out to God. God am I crazy? What's wrong with me? Etc. Hearing that helped calm me. Or the huge black homeless man doped up on seroquel and depakote. He snored almost the entire 12 hours I was there. And I can tell you that was the most soothing noise. It reminded me of sleeping next to my Ex. Anyways I digress. I want you tonight to make a pact with yourself. No matter what happens your are no longer going to say shitty things to yourself. Or shame yourself when you mess up or your family calls you a pos. Be truthful and honest with yourself. Did I do behaviors while I was high that sound like a pos person? If yes then recognize, forgive yourself, and make amends. Forgive the people that hurt you, not for them and it doesn't mean the behavior was ok. Do it for yourself. So you can move on and they no longer rent space in your head. You have the power to change. It's ok to go in the past if u need to understand or work things out. But don't live their and don't use it to bleed on others, or to manipulate others. Ask yourself what you truly want. Write it down. Draw it in a picture. Post it wherever you can and give yourself a timeline. And when you mess up find a higher power and pray to it. I think there's even a church called the flying spegatti monster. Lmao. Pray to that. Get out of your head and your shame. When your spiraling and you want to use, do grounding techniques. 5 senses. Smell taste etc. Get some sexy perfume and smell it, eat something sour. I love sour patch kids. Etc. You got this. You can do it. Jelly roll did it. You can too. And baby if your gonna use make sure you know what's in that shit. Cause I don't want u to take a fentanly nap. Your too important to me and your loved ones. And your story and struggle needs to be heard. Watch the movie love is not enough with Wynonna Ryder on the plex app. It's free. Stay safe. Be thankful for the people still in your life. And don't buy into the rock bottom bullshit. You don't have to hit rock bottom to change.
❤ If you have never loved a person struggling with addiction will never understand how painful it is for them and for you
Damn it Joyner!!! U are now my favorite rapper!!! Highly relatable on so many levels salute king!!!
AmaSINGly powerful
You’ll never believe someone who believes in you if you don’t believe in yourself
Honestly might be the best song you’ve ever released.
Joyner you are truly a genius. Your songs hit different. I'm a huge fan. I'm from Chelsea Ma. Proud that the best rapper of today's generation is from MA. ❤🙏 God bless you sir.
Damn this song is beautiful
If you don’t believe in yourself  You’ll never believe in anyone else believing in you
Ever person battling addiction needs one thing.  That's that one person that care. Most of us don't have that
Music is the voice of the Angels!
Why'd you autotune Jelly so hard .
Elevated 🐐
Damn this nade me cry
Joyner Lucas is one of the best storytellers hands down this new album is the best album of the year
This is your best song
Song that needed to be done. Recovering alcoholic, 6 years sober now. This hits home hard, I wish it was out when I was imploding.
We haven't talked since the day he came home from the hospital.  He missed his vein . Got infected and almost lost his arm. I told his mom he tested positive for meth in the hospital.  He told his family I lied.  We don't talk anymore.
I introduced my brother to Joyner Lucas few months ago. He likes your music and unfortunately he is a fentanyl Addict and I sent this to him hopefully he notices what he is doing.
Thank you jelly & Joyner. A lot of us needed this more than you know. Crying, alone in this bathroom (not the first…. This week) it’s hard to trust people who love me when they say they believe in me, cuz I don’t. This song was hittting every mail on the head. Line after line. I love you guys. 😭 ✌🏽
damn lol this is the only rap song that makes me cry out of nowhere HAHA sending virtual hugs for those who are fighting the battle i wish you guys can over come it

I bet jelly was really wanting to rap on this track.
Wow just wow
Wait who was the last person that rapped? He was fire
Addiction took my mother from me and her amazing grand babies. This song hurts my soul😢
My cousin overdosed last year I wish this song was out before this just broke me down so bad because I tried everything I could to help him 21 years old and the only person I could talk to I miss him so much 😢
He has a nice voice !
Got tear eyed watching dude lay on the floor knowing that’s how my brother went out last year
Awesome song!
came here to hoping to hate and so glad im not dissapointed lmfao   Joyner Lucas, a cheap one trick pony, probably the absolute most mundane flow of all time, most mundane bars of all time. same exact music video every time 😂 dude really thought he did something here too 😂😂   jelly rolls autotune, way overdone. i hope you paid $2000 for the chorus man because this has got to be the most forgettable song of all time
❤❤❤🌍🇬🇳🏴‍☠️🙌🏿
Y’all better give this man his fu#king🙏🏽💯
Damn man this song is deep and it hits right at home with me thank you for this song. ❤
R.i.p. Dylan your big cousin loves you cuzzo
And after
get rid of the cia and pharma half our drug problems be out the window this is a man made problem and its done all in the name of profit. Jesus will set you free i can promise that. prayers and being in the word of god will ease you off all your burdens. God is there and hes looking forward to you reaching out. trust!
Hope so too. ❤
Joyner....there you go again making me cry. Superb job sir! Salute to Jelly Roll🫡
Still got the heat.. deff never missed.. visuals always 🔥🔥🔥
I love the rammstein shirt on that drug addict dude!!!
This song is perfection ❤
I was really hoping jelly roll woulda got a verse in this, he deserves more than a hook, but still this was a deep song 💯
Idk if this hurts or makes me feel like someone gets it
I just hit my 10 year mark of being clean, and this brought up emotions I haven't felt in awhile.
Amazing work guys.
Going on 2 years clean from Methamphetamine 🎉❤
I expected joyner to do his thing he always gives excellence but jelly rolls vocals hit me right in the chest this is a masterpiece definitely a made a new jelly roll fan out of me today!
Powerful and impactful 🙌 great song, great video 🔥🔥🔥
Straight fire
I think joyner is the only one who talks about the important things thats matter to society 🫡❤️
Ya, this song definitely gave me chills
yall dumb if you lke this song
🙏 🙏 🙏
❤❤❤❤
I lost my brother Dakota to a Fentanyl OD two years ago, and my little brother Joel to Mental health, and alcohol the year before. It has changed our family forever. This song has given me the understanding I needed from their POV. Thank you.
This song made me cry so much haha. My mom’s an addict and I want her to hear this song so bad so she can realize she’s ruining her life and that she has her family behind her to help her through it
Top 10 trending!!! Good going joyner and jelly
So JC decided to provide rap therapy for free. Challenge is most in need of therapy don't know they need it, so we don't honour this King enough. Thank you Lucas!
I miss my brother every day.
I never imagined when I was a kid that pretty much every family in the future would've lost somebody to overdose. We are sick inside and people are looking to numb the pain because there's so much of it. Glad to see so many escaped that life and have been able to make it through. Absolutely beautiful man.
My God. What a music 😢🇺🇲🇬🇼❤
I have replayed this song over and over again and it makes me cry every time I hear it. I was a heroin/fentanyl addict from the age of 18-34. Here I stand today coming up on 7 yrs of sobriety next month. Only God could save me cause i couldn't save myself. This song is touching so many people's lives. Praying for those still stuck in the hell of addiction🙏 There is a beautiful life waiting for you on the other side❤
It’s kinda crazy I came across this song when I did. I’ve been watching someone I love loose themselves to alcohol addiction and i honestly don’t know what to do to help them anymore
This shit hit way different tho! This is one of those songs that touch the real hearts FRFR
Joyner NEVER disappoints
ANOTHER stunning visual from Joyner!
Reach for the sky, Hello God,Help🙏
I’m so depressed as a nigga who dead ass will always be an addict idk how to deal with life atm I don’t even know why I’m venting on here but it’s so hard to stay on the right path when life is beating the shit out of u daily I don’t even know how to deal with my own emotions smh long story short someone pray for me being alone is the worst feeling smh
Corny
BIG TUNE 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Almost 3 months free from drugs and this song definitely hits deep
wish Jelly Roll had a verse or sang a bit more but otherwise ill listen to this song for decades
My husband and I have been clean for 10+ years now and we stood by each other throughout the entire situation 14 years going strong this song is beautiful and so relatable ❤
Post Malone never disappoints man
its comin up on the death anni of a friend i met in program. i think he really wouldve loved this song. im gonna play this when i make him his yearly cupcakes. hope he hears it. im so glad i got clean when i did.
My mom, my hope was always that she would find a way to get better... But at this point i feel like i'll never see that. I love her from afar. Thank you for this song🖤
Need more of you two, Joyner is top notch one of the best to ever do it.
Aha gazelle  better
Beautifully done
Put lyrics in description please. Bet you’ll get more views…
Joyner should have let jelly do that second verse.
@trianajavar2821. That’s awesome 🙏. Bless you both , pray it works for him also.
God dam man hits that spot
As the younger brother I tried showing my oldest brother through action what change was.... maybe I need to change my approach
Beautiful 🥲❤️
..........it's hard
My parents my whole life
Just know every single one of you are loved. I’ve never used but had family do it. No matter what you all still have a voice. I hope this makes someone feel better.
This is music this is inspiration this is life ❤
🫡👊🥺
Broooo this is the song that is going to help those in pain
Redbar likes you ❤
💪🔥🎤‼️
I lost my mom because she had an addiction and it hurts so bad I miss her so much 😔
When words fail, music speaks. 🔥🔥🔥
so this is what Jelly Roll sold out for? Sad...
I cried like I haven't in a long time listening to this. I love someone addicted and in recovery now. Rehab 9 times. I pray she's successful this time. Thank you.
I needed to hear this song, thank you so much Joyner Lucas for putting this out you were literally are gift sent from God. Thank you for inspiring and motivating and being there for all of us who listen to your music every day.
That's  so REAL! It hit home.
Powerful song
Speechless 😮😢 this touches my soul to it's core 😭🤧  Thank you for making that song & jelly roll thank you for existing! God knows I needed your music to help me cope and get back on track!! My family is huge fans but your fame has nothing to do with why you touch our hearts 💞
That looks like the same actor that played the cop in jelly rolls "nothing left at"
🔋 💪
To everyone smoking Kush in My County Sierra Leone 🇸🇱 I wish God almighty Change you💔😢😭 Coz I know addiction is this disease 💔😢😭🙏
Joyner is fire❤
Everything has to be gay. Everything.
The second verse made me very emotional. Especially when he said "how come you only there for me when I'm trying to get clean." Many times you can have a million dollar idea n no one will invest in you until you dead or in the hospital
I spent 10 years in a hole, literally drowning in alcohol and relying on weed to be happy. I wasted those years waiting for something to save me. I finally woke up, 2 years sober in March 2024. I made it here and it was a fight but hearing this song reminds me of how hard i fought. And how I've lost so much addiction. But I've created a new start for myself, for my husband and for my kids; I stay sober, I fight the fight everyday. I pray that if you are fighting for sobriety that you will find your strength.
Wow awesome job on this you guys ❤
Wow this is deep ❤
This Is Amazing!!
My daughter just left her abusive husband. He relapsed the day the song came out and 3 days later tried to kick in the door with his babies home. Addiction took his family and this ain't is the reason my daughter is still sober
I wanted to hear rap verse from Jelly Roll.
they need to make a rap about weight featuring jelly ross in the video while joyner rapping 😂
He needs more views and respect for his music omg man!!!
💐
I had one wish wld be to meet you bro jelly roll keep it coming
FK THE BIG 3 ITS JOYNER LUCAS! 🐐
This song will touch millions and millions of people, just like drugs. What an amazing song.
Joyner back to his story telling!! Absolutely love this ❤️
I’ve never had an addiction but I know what it feels like to watch someone you love so much just slowly drift away due to addiction and it hurts so much. I’ve never cried to a song before but this one just destroyed me. I love you dad, I hope you find your way back
God bless the men in the video ❤🎉😂😂
i just can't stop listening to this song, thank you joyner!
The collab I never knew I needed. Thank for everything you give out🙌
This is the MUSIC that deserve a Grammy ...2....actually  one for the song and one for the video. 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This why you different. I posted a snippet of a verse you had a reel for about a year ago and someone mentioned (again) that the album wasn't done. You don't rush this. Keep this powerfulness coming bro ✊🏽
Real hip pop ..music that makes sense
I love Joyner and I fuck with this song. But believe me, addiction is a disease that there is no cure for. It’s a disease of the mind, body and soul. I struggled with booze then dope and benzos for over a decade. I tried everything within my power to quit. Impossible. My best thinking is what kept me from being able to stop. Tapering off 100mg+ of methadone twice. Just to fall back into one of my vices and then picking up right where I left off. It wasn’t until one of a few trips to the ER that I had had enough, my family surrounded me crying, fearful, afraid. I committed to 60 days inpatient rehab, lived in a sober house for a year, with other men like me. People that no matter how fucked up something I had done or was feeling…they understood. I’m not saying my path is for everyone. But I had to separate myself from everything and everyone. Showing up to rehab with a pair of sneakers and an and some clothes in a trash bag. But listen, this is the big one. It’s not a disease that you can give someone. It’s a disease that affects your loved ones by making them sick. Always worrying if alive, where you are, the days/weeks with no contact. It will make anyone who truly cares about you spiritually and mentally sick. In my case the only one I had left who cared was my mom. I had to get clean for myself and I did back in 2018. Our relationship has NEVER been better. I believe I was born an addict. It just manifested itself in other ways…until I found drugs and alcohol. So yes, addiction is a disease and you can give it to people. They are going to be sick and suffer until you get better…or die and then move on. It took my mom ALANON meetings, therapy and most importantly seeing me clean and happy before she could start healing. Remember that. I’ve heard other addicts tell me that never stole anything. Beleive me, you stole someone’s piece of mind, while they were worried sick about you. Lastly, to anyone out there still sick and suffering. Reach out. There are resources. I knew nothing about getting help until I truly decided it was time to try. Start at the hospital and get a psych evaluation. They can refer you to places where there are good people who thrive off giving back. I work in a hospital now and I have seen the sickest of the sick, rock bottom, walking death come back to visit months later a completely new person. A new outlook on life, just glowing. To all those with loved ones still going through it. As hard as it will be, you cannot enable an addict. An addict will lie, cheat and steal to get to that next fix. It’s fact that in active addiction it affects the part of your brain that tells you if you don’t get your fix, you will die. Your brain lying to you and making the only thing you care about is when, where and how am I getting my next sniff, shot or smoke. Addicts are some of the coolest most lovable people I’ve ever met once they have recovered from that hopeless state of mind. Completely different than when they are out running and gunning. It’s a miserable way to live, trust me. If you are worried what people will think if you head to treatment. Fuck them. You don’t want them in your life anyway. One of the hardest parts for me was getting over the stigma. Now I have no problem being open with complete strangers. I’m proud of my accomplishments and so will you. God bless you all. Sorry for the rant but I’ve lost too many friends to this and the more we talk about it, the more we break down those stigma walls. If you want to hear a song that really breaks it down what it’s like to live the life of an addict pull up “drug addiction - Colicchie”. I still get chills when I listen to it. I heard him speak once. Real down to earth dude. Gives back. That’s what it’s all about in the end. If you can’t get out of your head, do something for someone else. It works.
This is why I love listening to your music, because you rap about things  that should be talked about and taken a lot more seriously in this world. I was addicted to oxycontin and opanas (I was told it's pretty much heroin in a pill) for 13 years and I lost Everything!!! I went to treatment, but when I graduated I went home to my boyfriend at the time still doing it so I was 11 weeks clean and went home and done a line same-day. Long story short. I cut EVERYONE off even family didn't speak to them or hange around anyone that apart of that life even the sellers!! I finally got tired of living my life that way and my kids were the ones suffering! I just went to doctor and got on Suboxone and I know a lot of people say thats just another addiction but it saved my life!! I was pretty lonely cause you don't realize who your real friends are until you clean up. I was done with it all!! I've been clean for 9 years know and I'm still suffering the consequences of my addiction till this day it's not worth it! Joyner Lucas you definitely my favorite rapper ever!!! Please keep speaking on things that needs to be brought up in this world and we need to start or try to do more things about it!! Stay blessed and this song really touched my soul foreal!
Thanks, guys!! Such a necessary song...
Cringe
Tell me is it really love if u have to ask if the will stay
voices of 2  men that seen and been through it all keep inspiring jelly and joyner my boys
I honestly don’t even  have the words to describe how amazing this song is, shit just hit different, I’m talking real different 🤯
Wow! Shit brought me to tears. 🔥
As a recovering addict, seeing my closest family and closest friends OD.. this song makes me realize drugs were never worth it, thank you ❤️
This one hit different. Thank you for making music like this.

OG JOYNER LUCAS#1
I was that person and now I am not anymore. Shaking writing this
I need help
I wish it was that easy to throw them pills away.  One day i will. 🙏 I no I will ❤
Love you Joyner
Joyner is a blessing to this generation
This is a MASTERPIECE om gawd🔥🔥🙌🏽🏆
❤❤
Masterpiece well done
8 years doing heroin still struggling.. That second verse hits home hard.
My heart this artist. He has a unique talented and creative and innovative
This is amazing....my girl is country and loves jelly roll...im east coast and love joyner. Music bring everyone together.
Addiction is a nasty thing. It's tore my entire family apart-- and we were a totally normal family. Parents married for 35+ years, with good jobs, well provided for. All is kids were really good at sports, got good grades. We didn't have any of the warning signs you think of, and it still got us.   Thankfully I'm 5+ years clean now.  My 4th and final trip to prison was my rock bottom. I finally figured it out. But a lot of people aren't as lucky.  If you're still struggling reading this, just know YOU are the one with all the power. You can change anything you want with your own choices and with your mindset.  The hardest part is just making that commitment.
As someone who finally got clean after 20 yrs of addiction and just lost his little brother to an overdose, just wow man.
Man this hits home 😢
Lost my mother to overdose and then became addicted myself when I felt like there was no way out of my own misery. 4 years 3 months sober and living my life to the fullest. Rest in peace momma. We do Recover! ❤️
I’m sorry babe I love you
what an insanely beautiful poem that turned into a song
🔥🎵🫡
Joyner holding rap down 🤍
I lost my best friend of 12 years to heroin. When he died a piece of me went with him. I searched far and wide for music that touched that pain I felt and nothing hit it like this did. Thank you for this.
Angelical voice
I cried... My mom died last year to fentanyl.. 😢I miss her everyday but now I'm having my own kid and I will forever share my mom's story .
This should be #1 trending.
If you dont believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believing in you....
I od’d 3 times when I was I was a teenager by the time I was 18. This song hit home. My parents never knew until I told my my mom. A lot of people didn’t know.  I thank God that he gave me a chance to live bc now I have a beautiful daughter and she’s everything to me. I’d choose her over anything bc that love feels better than anything .
Damn, this hits home! 🙏❤️
That second verse was crazyyyy!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Coming up on 8 years away from it but man I can still to this day taste the helplessness and despair. If you are struggling please hear me that you can come out on the other side. All can be forgiven. We do recover! 💜
14 years of using meth, a woman came into my life and I'm now 2 years sober. Unfortunately she didn't stick around but her light still shines so bright!! Thank you for this song, it hits in so many ways! To all out there that struggle, it DOES get easier, just takes strength and patience. Good luck to all !!!!
Fire.... ID on the shoes Jelly got on at the start anyone? I recognise em but cant think... Someone drop some knowledge
He really don’t miss

REQUEST: JCK510 (Iconoclast)
My mom has been homeless and struggling with addiction since I was 16. I’m 24 now and still feel like that confused 16 year old girl. She has been coming in and out of my life since and I just pray daily that God gives her another day to see. Just lost my pops so I’m even more confused now but I can’t let what my parents do/did be a reflection of my decisions. I gotta do what’s best for me 🖤
They should start all public school health/safety assemblies with JL videos.. great stuff as usual
Wow. Another one Joyner
Real music
I've been on both sides of addiction and just know it does get better
Thank you for everything, man.
*If you don't believe in yourself, you'll never believe in somebody believing in you* ❤😢
the real GOAT @joynerlucas always all your songs have a message on them
That second verse is so on point!!! If you or someone you know has struggled with addiction then you will understand and really appreciate how masterful Joyner wrote this picture  and painted these words ❤️🔥
❤❤❤ thank you so much for taking such an important message and turn it into art. This music video shook me enough to start over and change my life. Much love 2 the artists and the prod. 🕊️
This is when Joyner is at his best
Wow ❤❤❤
Way too much autotune on this chorus I would love to hear both of them record this one live we need that raw sound that Jelly’s voice naturally has on that. Great song though love to see these 2 collaborate!
😢😢😢😢😢😢dis one hit home
Phenomenal message.  I live these lyrics.
It's 10 am and I'm all choked up. I hate drugs man, I really hope everyone battling to stay sober pushes through. There's so much greatness on the other side! Don't listen to the demons, listen to your loved ones.
Nobody asked
Masterpiece
Me and my brothers lost our mom in 2014 to fytenol overdose. She was in a rehab and guess someone there had stuff introduced her back into stuff or laced it but I was 15 losing a young mom she was getting Clean honestly she thought her body could handle same amount I guess it was accident according to autopsy but point is if u have an addiction you have to get Clean or your kids or family like my 2 brothers and aunt and grandma  found her I'm the oldest at 16 then brothers 14 ,10 found her lifeless like she wasn't there just empty and that image haunts me every day we did cpr till first responders got there and when my Nana her mother got the and was told she was gone the scream she let out burnt into my brain omg please if you have addiction there are ways to help family should be able to talk about anything plz take it from me I'm 25 now and still have nightmares from it sleep insomnia, depression don't do that to your family your worth everything to them I'm working on music now for a better me about real life if people can relate they will listen it's on tiktok @Just_4_Thought Name: Titan If you would like to talk because you matter to me if anything or watch my journey please just give my music a chance it's recorded on a phone working towards equipment but she loved music and feel like she can here me there I'm definitely humble and strive to be better then I was yesterday. Hope to see yall there or talking if anyone hasn't told you today I love you as one should love another once your light burns out that's it for that life make the most of what time you do have because time is limited per life
You forgot to credit that actor. He killed it.
Jelly roll absolutely saved my life! This right here made me cry and I have a sister that is now in rehab I hate she followed my foot steps but we are both survivors of addiction!!!
Jelly's address to Congress was amazing. I'm a cop and it's rough seeing all these people od, notifying their families, holding mothers as they break down. The war on drugs needs an overhaul, it's not working. We need more for addiction and rehab with resources for those to reintegrate into society. We need to stop hurting the addict and go after the predators that pander to the addiction.
I pray for my dad every day. He struggles with a meth addiction and it’s so hard seeing him caught in this trap of addiction. I hope he gets better before it’s to late
This is the Joyner that made me a fan.
Ropinarole ??? What
Jesus is Lord and only He saves. Turn to Him and seek God
My misses past away last year from tramadol OD.. this song just destroyed me 😢 please get help people x
🫡♥️
My brother sent me this… it’s funny I remember being a kid and my older brother (the one who sent the song) made my childhood hell with drug abuse, he would steal, lie argue with my mom and dad. I hated it I promised myself I would never get into hard drugs… I started taking opiates when I was 22 it was small use just to have fun let time pass chill play video games. Then my dad died when I was 25 and I started taking 15-20 oxy/hydro a day now I’m here losing my life everyday slowly..
This song passes the vibe check. Love to all my addicts alcoholics that feel defeated and its impossible.  We recover . You are loved. See you. ❤❤❤
💖
Lost my best friend to heroin he was only fucking 21 fuck pills man this is a beautiful ass song I really hope I slow my drinking down dont ever quit working on yourself you are more capable than what you think humans are amazing ❤
Damnn
Dammnnnn thanks gentlemen this is going to touch and save a lot of people that's a super power
Holy shit I just got out of 8 days in detox for opiates and this pops up on my YouTube right when I get out. 🔥 probably listened 10 times in a row. Joyner one of the 🐐
The song hits so hard. We have a daughter that's been an addict for 16 years. She started with pills went through heroin and is now into meth. We have lost track of how many times she has been to rehab and has even been to prison for 3 1/2 years for armed robbery to support her habit. Unfortunately she has a 10-year-old son caught up in this mess and we recently had to contact CPS again and finally got custody of him. Which scares us because he was the one thing that we believe kept her going. But his safety was a massive issue with the drug addicts hanging at her house and the drug dealers coming to collect at her house. Not to mention Her Mind Is So Gone the mental health she was putting him through was to much he said. We have tried every approach with her throughout the years and she has had support from everybody around her but nothing has worked, the only Solace we have is that her son is finally safe. We have unfortunately giving up on her but this song has me second-guessing myself now. She has literally ripped the family apart for 16 years so not knowing what to do at this point anymore. Even though it feels hopeless at this point it's just still so hard to walk away from somebody you love 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
This song hit me hard
Hits home
Jelly roll sounds like will sasso doing a Kenny Rodger’s impersonation. Your welcome
❤
Just got my 1 year sober yesterday
What a amazing story
Holy shit what a powerful song. Absolute masterpiece 🔥❤️
As a recovering addict 12 yrs opiate free.  I cant tell u how much truth is in this song.  People think this is hustle a song but there is such a important message in it.  Im a grown as man brought to tears from a song for the first time in my life.   Also good to see a masshole have success.  He will know what that means.  Thank u so much.  🙏

On drugs ten years it was hell I’m 5 years sober married with three kids good paying job loving life god always has a plan for everyone wish some of my friends would of held on a little longer
Love this song but I hate jelly didn’t rap I get the message but yall ain’t grow up on the same jelly I did
this just pop'd up in my feed.... I'm going to my cousins service today.. i wrote him off years ago, he recently passed form an overdose. It sucks because we both got into drugs at the same time... I left it alone, he went down a bad path... amazing song you guys
I'm cryin right now.. I've listened to this 5x in a row.. I'm in an oxford house in Kansas city 5 miles from where I grew up.  I'm an alcoholic.  Remember walkin ta high-school with water bottles full of vodka.. this song hugs tha shit outta me & I'm so very grateful I've made a decision that I need help.  God bless you joyner & jelly.  Thank you.
Mr roll s singing voice is beautiful huh😊
Why is everyone in the comment section an ex junkie?
Joyner being Joyner 💔💔
Love Jelly Roll but can't believe he teamed up with this sellout brainwashed sheep Joyner. He's from the same town as me, and everyone says the same thing. That he sold his soul for fame and fortune.
I lost two of my closets friends while incarcerated. I found my way but I couldn’t save them. And it ways on me. But as an addict myself, unfortunately I was powerless
Big love to all of you sharing your stories ❤️
You’re a magician
This song just made me cry thinking about my mom and her addiction… thank you Joyner for always keeping it 100 and not letting Hollywood conform you… I love you my guy and wish you many blessings and success
The best one.👌
Amazing 🎉 I lost a brother through his struggle :( thanks for this 😢
💯💯💯
I love seeing all your positive comments. Even tho i never went through addiction. Or i dont quite understand. Anyone can vent and try to help me understand so i can help maybe someone who needs it in the future. These comments and this song really helped me understand more. Thank you everyone and to Joyner for putting out another banger .
He just proved that you don’t need to make a “hit” to kill views
You know this is a #1 hit when you learned the whole song within a few times listening to it. P.s. This is DEEP.
Joyner make the most meaningful songs and videos mane 🔥🔥🔥 if you read this Joyner know your a GOAT 🐐 Never Change
This hits home so fking hard😢
The only people that don't think addiction is a disease, are those that don't fully understand it. I was able to change, but the demon is still there and will be there for the rest of my life, the same as any disease. It's a life long diagnosis and battle.   I'll be 5 years clean in May, but that doesn't matter. All that matters is that I am better today than I was yesterday. We do recover.🙏🏿
Yoooo this shit is real shit dont bitch this money this rap but real fking shit🔥
It's a good song but I cannot listen to it. It's all a part of a past I no longer live in. But I'll leave a like for support.  I had somebody I really loved.
WOW goose bumps hairs stand credit
The father of my son and fiance is now 16 months clean. It took going to jail for 13 months and me being on life support because we both had covid and pneumonia. I was on life support because I was scared to go I'll with out thr drugs my self. I am now days clean. Which at one time in my life would have never saw happening. My partner being clean for as long as he is gave me the courage to get thr suboxone shot. Fentanyl was our addiction. We went through 3 years of hell. I even got addicted to it my self after having our son who is approaching his second birthday. It took my son's dad missing thr birth of our child ans almost over dosing and so many other horrific experiences i don't wish on worst enemies. I pray to any addict who's in addictive addiction to find the courage to get them selves clean or for God sake ask some one for help. Your capable of getting better and we are only as strong as our mind allows us. If my partner who was once a career criminal.... with a lengthy criminal record can get him self clean for our son and my self not only us but his self and I could find the courage to begin this sobriety journey my self. I know that any one if capable of doing so 🙏🏻
Jelly roll is as wide as that stove, dope ass song
This song hits home 🏠 Around the world , I love it❤️‍🔥🎤
Second verse is so heavy 🔥🔥
Sad part jelly roll takes way from song not add to it
Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 1: Joyner Lucas] Yeah, I got somebody I love (Yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (Damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (Yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (Woah) But I wrotе this song in hopes when they'll hеar it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it enough (Woah) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (Damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and you makin' feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (Do what you might, woah) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (Tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (Lose it) And you wan' deny all about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me      [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 2: Joyner Lucas] Look, I know you been callin' for me (Yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long, I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (Uh) How do I look go of something I know is something is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (Nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, I'm tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me
This one hits close to home and cuts deep. Amazing song 🫡 😢 🙏 I hope everyone dealing with addiction finds a way out, because im living proof its possible! 7-21-2016
joyner please stay away from this jelly roll. i have a bad feeling about him
Damn this was deep
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fuck you'll crying here at 9 in the f-ing morning.....wow I think it hit to close to home 😢❤
Wow! Chills! Both perspectives. It’s a family disease and I had to get help just as much as my loved ones did. Some say we are addicted to “fixing”the addict. That seems true now that I’ve been in “recovery“ myself for 4 years. Whatever side of this addiction coin you are on, I encourage you to get help and educate yourself. 🙏🙏🙏🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️ It’s not us vs. them. We are all in this together. I hope we all find  the courage to get help and never stop.
I have a real question here. How do you help someone that has a drug problem such as meth, when the drug culture around meth is typically violent and manipulative?  Especially if you have a family and don't want to risk your family's safety.
I got  3 weeks is the hardest they say I'll never change I'm the  same when  I try to change gaslighting me
This joint is real.. great message. It takes strength to speak about pain. I feel this one. Hopefully whoever is lost, finds their way.. 🙏🏼
Thank you for not calling it a disease joyner. Addiction starts with a choice. But don't get it twisted addiction is addiction. Its in its own space.
Addictions are systematic...  The system is broken.  We all love someone in the struggle.  ❤😢
Sending this to my mother 😢
Joyner's song writing skills are on another level.
Dig your heels in strength lies in the determination to never quit stay the course I don't know anyone on these comments and I'm agnostic but I do believe we all have the power to alter our very lives and the fibers of our own existence. Realize the power you all have I maintain hope that the ones struggling with these diseases in our country have the strength to pull through. We need our fathers our mothers let's put a stop to the mass killings over drugs.
This song brought me to tears...my belated Sons birthday will celebrated in HEAVEN  day tomorrow.😢😢😢 My sweet beautiful Ricky Vince, I love you forever and ever 💕
🔥
My husband relapsed summer of 2022. Right after we found out I was pregnant with the baby we wanted so bad. Struggled for conceive for 2.5yrs.. Last summer was such hell. Going through post partum for the first time. Begging him to just be with us. The hiding drugs. The running away for days. The knock out drag out fights. The withdrawals. Rubbing his sore muscles. Looking at the shell of someone I love more than life itself. While holding our new baby in tears apologizing for bringing him into a situation I wasn’t even aware was going on at the time. Our beautiful boy is now 14 months old. A spitting image of his daddy. Hubs went to jail, after catching another felony June 13th. He was out by august. He’s now, by the grace of god clean. He lost his father (who put him back onto the drugs) Dec. of this year to fent OD. A few days before his 24th birthday. I was scared he’d relapse, as he felt bad for not speaking to him while trying to be sober. I’m beyond proud of my man for making it out alive for himself, our boy, and myself. But there’s always that worry in the back of my head that he’ll go down that road again. But hey. That’s loving someone that’s struggled with addiction his whole life. But he’s stronger than that. ❤
This song HARD!!! 💯💯💯
Was raped as a child and I’m sorry I can’t put the shit down I got no one so imma keep going till I’m gone only way out
💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is so close to home for me! This is my sister!
Finally someone was able to put it in words. 😭😭
Absolutely dope song!!
Well to be perfectly honest, in my humble opinion, of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view, but also by looking into this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of one's view's and by trying to make it objectified, and by considering each and every one's valid opinion, I honestly believe that I completely forgot what I was going to say.
This song slaps harder than a laced blunt. I hope it helps those suffering, and saves lives. Excellent music video/short film.
Beautiful song
I'm breaking down here! Thank you JLJR!
Man two of my favorites collabing. Awesome shit.
❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn i can feel this song from the depths of my heart
This dude is soooooo underrated
I lost my kids’ dad the love of my life in 2013 to a heroin/fentanyl overdose. This song made me cry so hard. Thank you it speaks to my soul. ❤
this is Og Joyner lucas
Can we get a feature with #nfrealmusic this is some respectably talented artist nonetheless no cursing just REAL
How ya know the plans he has For me! The struggle is real!
😢
What i find hard to understand joyner is how you can come up with really important stuff like this. So deep that whomever watches listens to every word. You're gifted man and thankful that you always share it. ❤❤
Letting go was one of the hardest things I ever had to do and I just sat back and prayed please let them go to jail not die and they did go to jail and they are doing great today but if I wouldn't have let go none of us would be here today
Really great track. Especially against the backstop of all the cookie cutter stuff out.  Great work!.
Im addicted to smoking weed
Thanks for this masterpiece! 🙏🏾
Fuck this is good 🥹
drugs are tough man. sometimes it feels like they’re the only thing that makes life enjoyable. but that’s when you’re using. when you’re sober and doing the right things in your life that’s when you find true happiness. that’s what i believe, i haven’t got there yet but i am working on it
I know that this song is about addiction, but I just want to say from someone that has dealt with severe depression this really hit me deep as well on that aspect of it too. Some people don't realize that addiction and depression sometimes go hand and  hand. You never really know what people are going through or why they get addicted to certain substances, but it is always good to remember for every dark night there's a brighter morning.
@JoynerLucasOfficial. The sense you sing hits deep into the heart. Thanks for always lifting us up with the gift of music!
ADDICTION IS NOT A DISEASE!!  ⚠️ The industry calls it a disease to enable you!! To give you a reason to continue to destroy yourself and make you think you do not have control over it!!!! ⚠️   Population control, insurance money to keep rehabs opened and a revolving door for the medical industry‼️
2 years and 4 months clean the charity in my mind has never been better
@joynerlucasofficial 🙏🙏 thank you so much for this bro. This hits home like no other track i have ever heard addiction has been a generational curse this song is going to change lives I hope it grows bigger than anything out right now and having @jellyroll on the track makes it even harder... Great work fellas 💯💯💯
❤❤️ from 🇧🇩

As a recovering addict this is so many sides and it is very well portrayed. Thank you so much for understanding the perspectives. So glad the music industry is reaching for the other side. 💜
I lost him last year 😢. RIP Tyler Wyatt I think of you every day lil bro, I wish I knew.
😇🤔🦾💪🙏🤲
My Mom was addicted to pills. She went to rehab and is now addicted to suboxone. The cycle never ends.
Its been so long since ive heard a song like this that gave me chills all down my spine. Straight up hit home and had me in tears,  thank you for this!!!!!!
I pray for somebody out there who is addicted to drugs to remember who they were before the addiction I was once an alcoholic but by the grace of God am free from that Amen
Please try to push harm reduction and progress over perfection Remembering any strep in the right direction and away from the limitless tolerence rise of any and all opiod type of chemicals whether street or script there is no roof or ceiling It Will absolutely always take more tomorrow than it did today in the lay of that land. In orher words people go crazy most times out of a strong will to live and survive and those primal   necessities a human body needs to stay alive as in food shelter and cool wits clear  mind to solve problems they believe its 100% or DEATH and it sets them up for a worse and more destructive fall if they have a few beers or smoke some tree. Dope is bad enough but the other doors you open your body mind and soul to injecting anything a man in the street puts in a bag and sells you it could be death so many different ways other than an overdose of heroin. There's more narcan flying around the streets that its not going to be the actual dope mist times that takes you out. Its the infectious and poisonous cutting agents It's the potent fentanyl and research chemical derivatives added its anything the man says is whatever he knows you crave. Most addicts thees days get home and are not happy with what they have and its not what they crave it makes them need it more while their bodies are fighting the damages of the first bags of poison injected. Most aren't even cleared for human consumption Im just saying try to get him in a mind frame of hurting himself less rather than expecting total abstinence from all mind Altering substance. Because like it or not almost everyone in America has their own substance list for the comforts recieved whether it's chamomile or lavender tea or dope fein lean. Everyone self medicates in their own ways. Push healthier ways and alternative methids of finding peace within and over time it will naturally progress into a life he doesn't hate to live. And remember EVERYONE I KNOW IN ADDICTION GETS LEFT IN THE WIND BY THEYRE LOVED ONES AND LONELINESS IS ONE OF THE MOST CRIPPLING AFFECTS TO MAN AND HIS WILL TO LIVE A LIFE WORTH LIVING. STOP ENABLING BUT NEVER STOP CHECKING IN, SHOWING UP, CALLING REGULARLY TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT ALONE AND STRUGGLING IN OTHER WAYS. H.A.L.T. AS WELL TELL HIM WHEN HE FINDS HIMSELF CRAVING. CHECK HIMSELF. IS HE HUNGRY ANGRY LONELY TIRED? AND FIX THOSE THINGS FIRST BEFORE PICKING UP HARM REDUCTION AND UNDERSTANDING PROGRESS OVER PERFECTION WHEN IT COMES TO ABSTINENCE AND SLIPS IVE BEEN PHYSICALLY ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND HAD A SLIGHT ADDICTION TO SUBOXONE ACTUALLY AND THREW A COUPLE YEARS TO THE STIMULANTS AND SUCH AFTER GETTING BOOZE IN CHECK. I KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT ADDICTION BUT PHYSICALLY ADDICTING THINGS ARE WORSE AND USUALLY BUILD TOLERANCE THAT IS LIMITLESS  Hopefully some of those ideas help. God bless you all
This is a really good song salute to you Joyner Lucas and Jelly Roll 🫡  This song hits hard because everyone knows someone who is going through this exact same thing. I’m not the crying type I don’t cry but this song brought tears to my eyes.
👑
3 years sober and never looking back!
This song made me tear up bro, I’ve been realizing how much my life needs change recently, and this just feels like a final push from the universe telling me to fuckin lock in already
Thank you.
18 months clean on the 16th 💪 Getting & staying clean was the hardest thing I've ever done. I am so blessed to be sober today!
I don’t have a personal experience with drugs… and I hope I never do. But reading these comments made my day. I’m really happy people are getting better ❤
This is powerful
❤️‍🩹
Very cool somg and Jelly Roll needs to thank whoever did that exceptional job of auto-tuning his voice.  😄😄😄😄😄 He wish he could sing like that. Lol!
I’ve always loved the way Joyner expresses both sides 🤍
Massive Joyner fan and a slightly lesser fan of jelly's but big man carried this song af!
Tried committing suicide at the beginning of this month pills and slit my wrists my ex has been the light in my darkness ever since she may not love me the way i love her but im still here because of her
If you don't believe in yourself then you'll never believe in someone believing in you!!!
Listen to this song close, every word please, 🙏✝️ you guys did it, this a not just a song but A message that could save millions of people and tortured souls. Keep going 💪
This made me emotional man damn...I been there😢😮
These kinda songs are why I love rap music
I have been on both sides of this song.  17 yrs sober here.  I absolutely felt this in my soul.  Thank you for articulating so perfectly what it's like on each side.  Wow.
Jelly roll is the perfect feature. So underrated
Addiction is a killer I bee sober. But still I stumble evry now and then and catch myself it's hard..my lil brother still out doing same thing I try to tell him enough is enough.but he too caught up in a toxic relationship and from downers he now hooked on uppers and staying up talking crazy..addiction is a killer.
Man shit hits different.  😢
Jelly is an absolute legend. Been following him for so long. And he never ceases to amaze me. They absolutely killed this. Congrats to the both of yall. Joyner so underrated too. Flowers to both
I can relate. Addiction killed my husband died from kid/ liver failure I didn’t become a addict till my 30s got clean in 2015 but relapsed in 2017 for a couple of months had a kid/liver transplant sept 22’
Joyner is a genius 😑
Joyner Lucas is this generation's best storyteller.  The way he can shift perspectives with his words is real art and poetry. This is a dead art unfortunately, you can count on one hand the best storytellers. Joyner is in the top 5 greatest without a doubt. #RealMusic
The most real duo we needed... thank you both for the message..
This song was very real  So deep.
“If you don’t believe in yourself, you’ll never believe in someone believing in you”
I've been trying to stop smoking the devils lettuce for the longest. It's time to give it another try.
Grammy or it's rigged
Felt like old Joyner! loved this, cuz stay tuggin at the heart strings!😭
Jus how im feeling rite now every word glad I found it if it was meant to be it was meant to be
This is fire! The cool thing about the brain is that it can be molded and remolded with new pathways being formed over time. So theoretically if your brain is molded to be addicted to the stimuli received by drugs, gambling, porn, etc. then it can be remolded to a healthier state as well!!
This is finally a song for me my parents have been addicts since I was born my mom finally got sober when I was 22 my dad went to heroin he passed away 2 years ago and I never felt a song that made it feel like home more than this
I feel like this song will help alot of people music is power and this is powerful music ❤
Idc Joyner is an amazing story teller and lyricist and he is more than great and doesn’t get what he deserves and if I were him I wouldn’t want it because he is beyond mainstream ❤jelly also sounded great on this one. It’s nice to hear him on a non country song again.
Yeah 😢 my best friend died 10 years ago 😭 RIP Tom Scott 😢
Everyone I know is stuck on drugs and this song hit home.  Everytime I talk to them I do end up preaching and I’m sorry.
Underrated still , cmon why he doesn’t get recognized like all this garbage out now in hip hop , don’t wanna say names but the music they put out is acid on your brain literally
🙏🏼✝️🙏🏼🫂✨🤟🏼
Dam im only half way thru and it amazing just beautiful
Powerful 🔥🫡
😢is this another gay song😮
Love seeing jelly finally getting recognition ! Beautiful voice and an amazing songwriter ! Been fucking w him from day 1
I feel this deep in my soul my homeboy who I met after I got out in rehab I've managed to stay sober he's relapsed twice now and I've held him down on his commissary and helped make sure his girl and kids have what they need while he's away and the fucked up thing is when you know how great a person can be but youre just watching them fade
Better than big Sean by miles
Joyner your a real one, great lyricist. Congrats on the new album.
LYRICS:  How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  Yeah, I got somebody I love (Yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (Damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (Yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (Woah) But I wrote this song in hopes when they'll hear it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it as much (Woah) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (Damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and you makin' feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (Do what you might, woah) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (Tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (Lose it) And you wan' deny all about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me  How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  Look, I know you been callin' for me (Yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long, I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (Uh) How do I look go of something I know is something is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (Nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, I'm tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me  How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  Listen to my song "Happy 4 U" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn-TwQuT-To

Lost my Brother in 22 from fentanyl overdose. Still tore up inside at times. I feel for all those who lost somebody close🙏I was a caught up in addiction for a lot of yrs myself.  But i want to encourage  somebody who may be struggling or has a loved one who is. Dont give up, not on your self or the other person. There is real Hope. There is One i seen personally who can take a situation from death and bring Life to it. JESUS surrender  completely to Him. By the power of Christ I’ve been set free from drugs and alcohol for over 10 yrs. there is Hope. not easy, but absolutely possible to Him✝️🕊️
Talk to them man thank u for this one reach them God Bless
Not much I can say about this besides I applaud you and everyone fighting the fight. 3 yrs clean myself and I wouldn't change it for the world. Some days are hard but talking to someone truly does help so If anyone is ever in there head about anything reach out to someone I promise it will help even if its just that day. <3
very smart
your doing big I love you joyner
God I love your music Joyner, your lyrics your story telling is superb. Life long supporter !!!
I've lost so many loved ones to addiction!!! This song is truth I am 7 years off of herion that stuff is the devil!! All I can say is if I did it any one can you just have to want it and be all the way committed to not doing it!!! Great song for real!!
You're an amazing artist, bro ❤
Damn didn’t think this would be good, man I was wrong  Dope af
25 months clean 2/22/22 this hit hard
🔥🔥
I love the comments so much. This hits home big time, wow.
Currently the one addicted 😢
Jelly Roll n Joyner Lucas at it again with another hit…especially the way addiction is running rampant more than ever these days. It’s everywhere. Everyone has one or more family member in addiction or a loved one. This song hits hard too close to home😢🙏🏻addictions tears relationships apart,ends lives,steals n takes n never stops.  Addiction never sleeps!!
Hope these rappers are thankful for the pain of others they can exploit and sell back to the addicts they once created.
Lowkey just a tier below kendrick drake and Cole top 5
No matter wat you been through you can get clean. I shot dope for 25 yrs. Today I'm working on 6 yrs clean and sober. I finally got my life back. It wasn't easy and it didn't happen over nite but it will I can promise that.....
also hats off to the guy playing the addict.
Wow. My best friend just lost her husband due to drugs. This song is amazing!! 💜🖤😢
Joyner Lucas 🔥
🙏🏾⭐️📺🫡‼️
A duo I never thought I see, but not mad🤔
Joyner Lucas don't ever dissapoint.
lost too many people to drugs and depression 😞
How can fat man jones go from putting on for popping another pill to being completely against them.  You and wyte where a hell of an influence to me when i was a child and that damage cannot be undone.  Now your preaching against the shit that you put on for so long.  "Pop another pill bitch thats my song".
Joyner e Jelly poderiam fazer um ft com Dax, ou um Remix disso.
I’ve never done drugs, but when that dude started rapping Joyner’s verse. Damn, that hit home
Joyner need to CUT that sh*t off his Head!! But yea Great Song bro!!🔥
I felt this to my core. Just recently lost my ex to od. I had to leave because of his heroine addiction.
HOLY sh!t guys , this was amazing and brutal at the same time, (could check my recent video to understand), but this hit home..HARD..me and my wife were in arms,..crying..😢 thankyou for this song, would love to hear a jellyroll verse on there!
Quem som absurdo 🔥🔥🇧🇷
I'll be sober 3 years in May. After 15 years of substance abuse. I grew tired of the man in the mirror and I finally gave in on what's best for me and mine. The Lord's blessings helped me through the recovery when I almost made it to the other side. God is good.
❤❤❤❤
7 years addicted to meth... I never wanted to get help because I felt like I wasn't worth it. My gf got pregnant, and tbh that's all the motivation I ended up needing. Been clean for 5 years now with a beautiful fiancé and child. Not even an inkling of the urge remains.
Why they do all that to jellys voice though...?? That's to much autotune. Bro can sing. 😂
It took me multiple times starting this song to get through it. I’ve recently started down my own recovery path. It’s so fucking hard for anyone that has never battled addiction to understand …. Thank you for this
This shit fire Joyner 🔥 Shoutout Worcester county
This shit fire Joyner 🔥 Shoutout Worcester county
Nice song I just don't like the autotune for jelly roll he has a natural voice that sounds good
Absolutely relatable song absolutely written perfect
Wayyyy too much autotune on jelly. Christ.
I pray, in Jesus almighty name, Amen 🙏🏻
Great hook jelly! Would love to hear you on a verse we know you got it!
2 of my favorites in one song!
This dudes music is a serious work of art,,straight Picasso 👌👍
I lost my role model but she's still alive... I'm scared one day I'm gonna get a call she's gone..
Lost my best friend of 20 years (I’m 30..) Feb 10th… wish I could have sent her this… wish I could have saved her. I’ve known her since I was 10. I miss her dearly 😔
Joyner lucas gives me so much of Eminem vibes the story tellin/ giving different perspectives this new album is so 🔥
😢😢😢
What a track! I mean damn! Goosebumps. So much pain... I feel every damn word!
Damn y'all this is deep
I just hit 4 years sober February 22nd im glad to be okay now but it still hurts thinking of all the people who watched me slowly kill myself. Ive lost 2 friends to drugs and alcohol and i wish everyday i did more to help them. This song makes me think of them Brandon and Derrick i love you guys forever im broken your gone but happy the pain isn't there anymore. Ill stay on track and keep making you proud i love you forever my brothers
Damn what a song!!! I felt this in my chest it hurts. In case if we never meet again in person, just know that i luv u (no gay shit!) and i miss those days when music was our only drugs my brodas @Weez @Dizz Damn!!
I think a lot of people can relate to the addicts perspective......me as well
I’m almost 2 years clean. This song is powerful 💖
Make sense
Best for me
I got tears in my eyes my little sister dealt with addiction for years. She got her peace in September 2021, her last gift was the gift of life for 4 donor patients. I hate drugs, love you always Veda 4eva 31.
this dude is a GOAT no doubt, his storytelling is next level
Realist shit ever Jelly Rollllll
Dope song whyte dude with auto tune lookn mad g a y doe
February 16th 2024- rip Sheldon Gulbrandson
My mom had 4 children, passed away 10 years ago and my oldest brother became an addict to Krystal not too long ago and we tried so hard to get him clean and we almost had him but got sick with pneumonia and his lungs where not strong enough to get through. My heart hurts but we will have him in our prayers forever. 12-03-2023
This song is going to save so many lives
Found my childs mom in bathtub April 30tg 2022 after the worst two weeks of my life I was homeless I had dealt with four violent ods of close ppl to me gave cpr to two of them saved all four but couldn't save the most important person to me unfortunately she gave her life so I could live mine and I've been clean since that day honestly do everything in your power possible to get your ppl clean because an entire generation is being wiped out every one I've ever been close to that used with me is dead I've lost 13 ppl narcanned 17 given cpr to 8 and I'm grateful everyday I'm one of the lucky ones that made it out I now have a great job my own apt my child in my life family that loves me ppl that trust me and stopped surviving and started living if you're in the pits of hell like I was and you're reading this you can too get help today not tm and live a life worth living I promise you it's worth it
THAT WAS THE HARDEST RAP IVE EVER HEARD‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️☆☆☆☆☆/☆☆☆☆☆
Your style of rapping both sides of an argument is straight 🔥 i feel every song you write is what this world needs. People have become so one-sided, refusing to hear another perspective and its tearing everyone apart.
Song of the year! Jelly voice is amazing, Joyner always killin it. This really hit me hard. Thank you for this song.
❤❤❤❤
I texted the number for my brother and the link it sent me literally does nothing. Just talks about what shatterproof is doing. I click find treatment for him and nothing in MI. How do I help my brother who is in denial before it’s too late? I’ve tried a petition to get him reviewed and they let him go. He’s 22 years old and nothing I do seems to help.
Being a recovering addict thank you ❤ Been a year sober now 🎉
Two years clean, heavy alchoholic percocet and meth. My first child is due april 26th. Baby girl. I have my own house, cars, a killer support group and am almost off parole. Never thought id make it to seeing my life change for the better. Im on my way to everything ive ever hoped for.
6 months 6 days fentanyl free today my friends no matter who you are and what you're going through I love you and you can do this! Grateful for my wife kids family and friends 💓
Love is never forced only given freely and shared and embraced!
This hits hard cuz I think about how I lost my mom to pills by overdosing
This song hit me hard
Never forget who we were. 💙
Thank you joyner this album came right on time 💪💪
🔥❤️🔥
Song definitely made me cry 🥺 such a good song! Real music real artists 🥺
That was gorgeous.
Damn this cut deep
Keep pushing to anyone out there needing positive vibes. For any reason whatsoever, it gets better if u keep pushing and stay strong. God bless
4 days sober….
I lost my best friend last year to speed.He was so spun out,He flipped a car and crashed.  I miss you bro.  Rest in Peace R.J.
This hits close to me I been staying away from alcohol mainly beer trying to not be an alcoholic. Doing it for my family.
3 years clean im 27 now and my last few months out there i was solo in my car. I had pushed everybody away. 10 years on meth and spice. What sucks about getting sober is realizing you're 10 years behind everybody your age. Wish i thot about that fact before i got sober maybe i wouldve got cleaner sooner. 10 years wasted. Been 3 years, got new harley, new f150, engaged and a step dad to a beautiful 2 year old girl and gonna be looking for a house next year. 10 years behind but i use it as motivation to work harder. I got shit to prove. Imma out do all these motherfuckers. It aint easy but I refuse to fail. By 30 imma have 2nd child, a home and money steadily going into my savings, i already carved it into stone
Sober 6 years now. Great song! 🔥 🔥 🔥
Most powerful verse of 2024.  “If you don’t believe in yourself, then you’ll never believe in somebody believing in you.”
This hits hard. I lost my little sister to addiction. It’s been nearly 2 years and still so painful. 😢
Extremely Deep best wt J.L. & J.R. They both made it a message to all that needs to hear this. FACTS ON TOP OF FACTS ❤❤❤😢😢
Addiction is a beast… about to celebrate 2 years after a slip up- to heroin, fentanyl, all street drugs and the entire force of evil that used to possess me and my friends, peace out. Love is the way 🙏🏼💗🙏🏼 Recovery is possible and even more beautiful that words can describe- if you’re struggling, here is your sign to alter your route 👊🏼
The only thing that could've made this song better was to kill the auto tune. Jelly roll is a talented vocalist, he doesn't need it. Otherwise, such a beautiful, and important message.
Damn @joynerlucasofficial you never cease to amaze me you are a true master of your craft. And thank you for giving us the collab we never knew we needed. Brotha you deserve your flowers cause you are a GOAT.
Thank you for this song. all I have to say is Kaitlyn
GAH DAMN
2 of my favorite musicians 🔥🔥
Hopefully Noone forgets me 😢 I don't want sympathy or oat I just wonder will of anyone will cause of all the bridges I've burnt chasing my high... I guess we'll never though
This song is a gem and will be forever
UNFUNKINGBELEIVABLE  REALLY TOUCHED BASE SALUTE  YALL DID THAT !!!
Wow this is real hip hop. Real skills gotta appreciate the talent for the story telling
I’m only human after all
Damn…. this song hit hard like, real hard… l was an addict for 10yrs, l been through it all, living on the streets, in & out of over 30 rehabs and detox centers.. My family tried and tried helping, but eventually it got to be too much. I can proudly and with strength say, I’m not 5yrs clean and sober.. If l can do it, so can you, if you’re reading this, you’re strong and not alone !
At 2:29 "nobody is perfect not even you, so why you keep targeting me. I feel like we can't even have a genuine conversation without you starting to preach." 🔥 🔥 This song is amazing. Arguing both sides is genius. Makes you understand a different perspective.
wow una completa locuraaa
I miss my son🥹
This song hits different after my break up, it makes me realize that she needed me after all the stuff she’s been through, I wish she was here so I could give her a hug and tell her I love her 😔💫 drugs can do a lot to one person
I'm a grown ass man crying to a rap song. Never thought I'd see the day.
If i could like this song  trillions of times i most definitely would.!!
Damn i just thought of something if Charlie Puth was on the chorus this song would transcend the charts
I really needed this at this exact moment. Thanks ,Joyner never disappoints
Jelly Roll wearing white Shaq Attaq shoes
As someone who died floated away and come back from an OD and still stayed in the life after 10yrs finally clean an hitting the 4yr mark I gotta say you fuckin nailed it on this one in every aspect just about ❤
Deep song, from the outside looking in and from the inside looking out. I suffered from addiction for years ,just recently God gave me the Strength and courage to overcome. It was hard at first and still sometimes is but with time I jus got stronger. Lost my lil cousin from fentynle at the age of 28 and so many young ppl around my city I know lost there life also. I pray for all you who are suffering from addiction to Get the strength and courage to overcome and get sober. Godbless u all
This one got to me I’ve been on both ends of this story and they both hurt
This rocked me to the core ❤
4+ years clean now from my ice addiction and love this song. Personally I hate when people call it a disease. It’s definitely a choice every time you do it. You can’t quit a disease, you quit a habit.
Fuck it Say the Name ! Call it for what it is and Who it is !!
Addiction is not a disease it’s a choice getting help is hard and getting over withdrawals is also hard but you can choose the hard way to get right anytime
❤
The love of my life is dying from drugs and its the worst thing you can ever go through. We have surpassed the bottom.  Grieving their death while their still "alive," is one of the most bizzare and unique experiences you can ever suffer through.
wow i lost my dad to alcoholism, this hits super deep. i want to work in substance abuse therapy - addiction is a disease! prayers for those struggling!
This is pure art Thanks for painting this piece of artwork
Every song Joyner touch got feeling facts
Already lost 4 people to OD this year……this shit hits home
The song was so good until Jelly Roll didn’t coming spitting a fire verse !
My oldesr brothers been addicted to drugs since he was about 17. We had a pretty bad childhood , in and out of prison hes 25 now still in the same boat try to help him as much as I can, but I couldn’t be around him anymore. Shit hurts, but I have to stay away until hes 100% ready to change. Ill be here.
6 months baby!!!💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
No hate what so ever .. song was amazing .. just wish jelly did a verse too ..
i love Joyner's 2 sided stories
This song hits so deep I'm five sober , this is the very first song that hits on every aspect of addiction sight of someone who loves an addict and the sight of an addict and their both very real aspects, I thank you Joyner Lucas and Jelly Roll for making this gem 💎 I prey that this song helps anyone fighting this life long war against addiction take it one battle at a time and you will be successful in the war, and I prey that the people who have love ones going through an addiction never give up on that person but remain strong and be supportive of them don't be to hard on their mistakes instead continually pushing them and  motivating them to continue to be sober much love to all.
Straight fire
🔥🔥🔥
My first day - Jelly roll
Joyner Is one of the 🐐 no doubt
3 months ago I would’ve looked at this differently and said, “this is so true,” but I’ve been a case a manager for almost 4 months now and this hits different. I’m about to put my clients onto some Joyner 😭
This is Real for Real
bruh wtf is this not hyped asf this song
Jelly 🔥
Reminds me of a "stan" version of addiction. Good video and song joyner.
I so wish my brother would have got cleaned. He passed away because of a fentanyl overdose. I miss him so much
❤
This Shit Right HERE IS A MESSAGING MASTERPIECE HIT SOOO HARD U DEFINITELY GOT ANOTHER TRUE FAN AFTER THIS ONE 😢, DEFINITELY WENT THERE THANKS BRO💪🏾💪🏾💯
I'm 5 years clean from Cristal. And 6 years from crack cocaine ice pills all the above.. great song and message
Still... stop with the "ohh my word I made it grillz"... we love you out here as you are... from RSA
#REAL
❤😊❤......."Beautiful soul wrenching song.!✝️👍😎💫
Just learning juice, I didn't know of his music until 2023😢 . But this is so good and I've been a lil sad . Cuz I should've known sooner😢
Joyner and Jelly doing a song YESSSSSSSSSS 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🤤🤤
Jelly needed 16 bars on this idc what yall say!!
This song is so deep, and it really hits home.  Wow.  You all did an amazing job! Brought me to tears.  I've lost so many friends n family to drugs. An addiction is 1 of the worst things in this entire world to overcome.  People feel empty inside, and they turn to the wrong things to fill that void. Not even thinking about the consequences that will follow. Over time, they become empty inside all over again, even  while they are still using,  just to feel normal and keep from feeling sick. It's heartbreaking. They slowly keep reaching for more n more links to a chain until they have held their own self captive,  no matter how hard they try.  And they don't have a key. Only then they realize they've lost everyone n everything.  No 1 trusts them anymore, n they've burned all bridges to everyone that did or does love them.  They are bound n stuck in this vicious cycle that just goes round n round like a Merry go  round, and they are too scared to jump off. It takes more willpower, strength, courage, and discipline than anyone could ever imagine. Most people never become free fr the chains n never succeed.  If they can withstand the pain mentally n physically, that comes with the Nightmares that they are facing, then they are 1 of the Lucky 1's that has been GRACED BY GOD!!!!!! And if they don't make it and they let only 1 Demon in, 7 more will follow.  MAY GOD BE WITH THEM AND HAVE MERCY ON THEIR SOULS.  AMEN
Truth&$$$
This is incredible I hope and pray my uncle comes out of it soon thanks bro
Real❤
Damn didn't need this right now 😅😢
“Everyone calling that shit a disease, making you feel like you’re right, I hate the fact that you use it as an excuse to do what you like”
I hope everyone the best, my dad is a alcoholic and my mom invited her brother to stay that’s recovering from being an alcoholic and drug addict.. I’ve caught her brother drinking multiple times after rehab but my dad doesn’t want help, I’ve tried multiple times telling him he really needs to get help but refuses.. as selfish as it is I can’t save them but I can save myself, I don’t drink or drugs because I’ve seen both sides, it’s a disease that I won’t be putting myself down the same road.. I can only hope they listen to me one day and change their lives before it’s too late
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥ONE OF MY FAVORITES OFF THE ALBUM JOYNER NEVER DISAPPOINT
make a song wit kaveman brown
My husband was an addict for nearly 30yrs. I told his family I had to learn to love a different version of him. He's been clean for 5yrs. I get to love another version yet again. Only this time it is a healthy clean version and it is truly a blessing
💯💯💯💯
💙
🔥🔥💯
Dont allow addiction define you let it be what refines you. #breakthestigma
I LISTEN TO THIS SONG TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME I ALMOST DIED EVERY WORD OF THIS IS SO ACCURATE IT HURTS THANK YOU FOR THIS MASTER PEACE  THIS NEEDS TO BE #1
I just went to detox and now I’m clean and sober waiting for rehab. This helps motivate me to stay clean. I don’t wanna be homie on the floor, crazy timing Joyner🙏
Bro thank you man i need this one so bad
Joyner went in on a important subject....many felt this one
Powerful.
This song went hard real rap real music....love Jelly Roll on the hook
I wasn't ready for this 😥😥 this weekend is the anniversary of my mom losing her battle with addiction 😥😥
Dude is holding a bottle of Valacyclovir @ 3:46 - must be TOUGH fighting those addiction demons when the addiction is to Herpes medicine.  I wonder how many you have to take to get high.
Incredible ❤
Can i get a RIP to my little brother who lost himself to heroin, he overdosed an died January 26th 2023 he was only 23 years old and i miss him so much...
Joyners special man!!
This song hits me hard. I started experimenting with drugs when I was only 11 years old. I've lost family members & friends to drugs. I watched them slowly kill themselves & yet I couldn't pull myself away from drugs. I went down the same path to the point that I overdosed on multiple occasions & 2 of them were on purpose. I'd drink till I passed out & later wake up in the middle of nowhere & not remembering how I got there. Unfortunately when I 23 I overdosed trying to take my life cause I felt like there was no hope for me. Luckily someone went to my apartment & found me. I woke up a week later not remembering who I was. It took me around 2 days to start remembering things & people. I decided right then & there that I needed to save myself so I quit drugs & alcohol on the spot. The first 3 years of that journey were the hardest but here I am now at 36 years old & I'm clean. I'm still not emotionally or mentally in a good place but I can't allow myself to go back to that lifestyle cause I know for a fact that if I do I'll never make it back.
The album version has the beat drop early in that second verse which takes away from that impact. The video makes you hold your breath during that passionate speech.
Now this is real rap. ❤
❤🙏
Jelly roll = fake  RagNboneman
🔥
Joyner doesn't miss! His songs, videos, themes etc always hit the mark!
I’m proud of Al of you in here. My brothers doing meth and my mom is occasionally smoking crack. Been a rough few months I had to find it all out by myself
Jelly from the vile with Joyner!! Anything is possible that’s why I push
Reall Ass Song!!!!
This song gunna blow
Watching my mom go through addiction and this song has been a lot of the conversation shared. Now I'm crying
Man this one really hit in the soul. I have been clean 6 years now. I still find myself randomly hugging the ones who had to deal with me and that i hurt and stole from just to feed the addiction. I feel like i can never say sorry enough. Thankyou so so so much for making this song. Im sitting here crying like a baby right now. Thankyou Thankyou THANKYOU for making a song about something that SO MANY PEOPLE in the WORLD can relate to on BOTH sides of the struggle. We needed this.❤
God this song literally makes cry like a baby I was adopted into family because my birth parents were strung out in drugs and just doing so bad  and even though the my mom my hero adopted me and rescued me the pain just never goes away when it comes to my birth parents and then choosing drugs over their kids and now that I am a single mother who is struggling and doing everything I can for my kid I can never ever forgive my birth parents at all
Great song. Been sober almost 5 yrs got a son now and a fiancé. The struggle is real. But I promise you getting sober is worth it
8 years sober as of 2-29-24. 13 years of opiate/heroin use- one of the worst battles I’ve ever fought.  Made me the strongest person in the world.
can we just give a shoutout to the white dude rapping lucas's part that man kilt it
Next song featuring ThatMexicanOT
don't do anything harder than Marijuana and you'll be okay... you gonna have to set a limit on your drug use  I'm being realistic not cliche... I live in California and I'm high every moment of everyday and you wanna know why... it's because I was in the army and broke my neck and shoulder and back jumping out a helicopter in 2014  and it only $500 a month and manageable... I'm not gonna sell you a dream of being drug free just downgrade to weed as a start and you'll add years to your life  California has weed delivery services so you can have it delivered and smoke and live your life in peace  plus they passed a new law where you job cannot test you for recreational weed use  just letting you know you don't have to live in a place where weed is illegal or an inconvenience  the choice is yours
Get them push-ups done hoss this shi! Goes hard!
Good song
I miss good rap songs. I appreciate this. 👍
We need to get this song to number 1 screw cardi b

I'm struggling with addiction and this song breaks me🥺
I listen to this song, teared up, then read your comments and 2 tear drops fell. It goes to show how much this impacts the ones we love!
Shit ....that's tuff.. right in the feels... real music prayers out to all the other people going through this shit.
Good word guys
I'm deeply sorry for you all that have lost someone close to addiction, even with love and understanding addiction is still a great battle to overcome, let us all be patient and never give in to this demon called addiction
If you don't believe in yourself than you'll never believe in anyone believing in you.... BARS!!!! I'm 8 years, tomorrow.
Joyner top 5 on this generation period . Joyner , Kendrick , J-cole keeping HipHop alive.
Just over 5 years sober, and I feel the urge to get high every day. I still feel unpredictable. This songs hits so deep. I appreciate it more than you guys can know.
Over the past 4 years, I’ve had 5 people ive been super close with kill themselves from overdosing, so this song is great to hear. Jelly roll, you’re an inspiration, thank you for everything you do, you inspire so many people, you lift people up. And Joyner, I’ve been a huge fan of your music for quite some time now, and every single one of your songs are also very inspiring and there’s so much detail put into them and that makes them become super relatable, so thank you as well for changing the world, both of you
3 years clean in may. Love seeing these 2 create a genuine piece of art that actually talks about something that matters.
Joyner and jelly the duo i never expected but god dam this is fire hits home in alot of ways after ending a 15year relationship finding my self again after being down at the bottom pulling myself back up 🫶🏻
@jellyroll @bunniexo @bunnyxo  @joynerlucas Absolutely made my skin shudder with goosebumps, the articulate way that you are able to voice your talents, both of you, is mesmerizing and ultimately the coolest thing. Regardless of the overall greatness me and my husband wish Jelly would have dropped a verse himself to add to the already amazing song but, that's just us being selfish lol.  Thank you both for making this.
Everyday I feel the bottle and pills tempting me, before you judge me know so many have been through much worse, but I can't seem to shake it. These feelings I just want to drown out till I feel nothing, or snuff myself out completely. I know no songs or lyrics can fix this hurt within that I hang onto, I need to accept the past and live for the present. I just want to be proud for once, but how can you be proud when you bring yourself back down to this low like an addiction all of it's own?  I guess I'll never know
Congratulations
Lost my brother to a heroin OD Joyner this hits Different 🙏❤️💯
Yep second verse hit me in the chest.
This song literally gave me goosebumps.
Well, damn. Wasn't expecting to feel like this today.
I lost my little brother about 3 years ago from a fentanyl overdose he was shooting up and didn't know it was  laced with fentanyl
9 months clean yesterday. Find recovery, BEFORE shit really hits the fan. Trust me. I've done my research.
Thanks Joyner for such true talent we dont get much of it these days🙏🏾,Shout out to Jelly too🤌🏾
This is a powerful song 🎵
Jesus Christ Is Coming Soon Repent & Draw Near To Him ✝️🙏😊
This one is outta here bro
Shot out to all of those with addictions.... there is love on the other side of it for you ❤❤❤❤ #lovingyouthroughthepain
Wow just wow. Hits home
I’m 11 months clean 4 days ago and my wife is 5 months clean. This song hits hard. It’s been a struggle for her more than me but we’ve had these moments where we thought we had to let the other one go. I’m just thankful for both of our sobriety. Getting clean is the hardest thing you’ll ever have to go through for those lucky enough not to have to go through it or watch their loved ones go through it. Consider yourself fortunate. For all of you who are struggling but trying to get clean, I see you, and your worth it. Much love ❤️
How are they gonna put Jelly Roll in a RAP song that’s perfect for him and not have him do at least one Bar :/ Jelly is a great singer and musician. All of his new fans have no idea how much better this would’ve been if HE was the one who did the verse from the perspective of the addicted friend :/
I've been off of the hard drugs and alcohol since July 18th and I'm not going to lie I'm still struggling everyday just to get through honestly I'm tired of fighting and trying to hang on
This immediately became one of my top 3 favorite joyner songs. Literally everything about this song is perfect.
Well shit.... I got a few in mind this is going out to right now. My dad being the first. He's been battling addiction to heroin and opiates, now fentanyl since I was 7. That was 40 years ago 😢 His health is now failing rapidly and I fear he may just go down in his blaze of glory...
Damn this shi it hard ASF frfr I lost my twin sister to drugs 😢
I lost one brother 05-05-21 and one 01-07-24 both to fentanyl this one hit me different it’s been a rough couple years love you boys forever 29
This song hits me right in the feels I’m going on 3 years sober and felt this in my soul
Everyone talking about drake j Cole kdot or future nobody talking about what joyner be doing with his music
Beautiful song❤
I think i love the comments more then the song tbh. I do love this song tho way better then i expected ❤👏🔥
You are enough. You don't deserve to be a slave to that dope man. I know you are hurting. I am hurting too. Just know, the hurt is much worse when you don't have control where your mind is swerving. Sit with the hurt. Accept it for what it is. The place that you long to be is right on the other side. You won't believe how strong you can actually be. Stop convincing yourself that you are not strong enough. That voice is a liar man. We need you to stand with us in this fight against the adversary. We done lost too many angels. We can't afford to lose you too. I love you man
I died 3 times 8 days ago. Never again.
I live on the street an I was an alcoholic I'm I think  3 yrs sober
I lost my mom to drugs and suicide
can bro link jelly roll's info though?  cmon bro.... show some love
HIT'S HARD!!!!!!
Having been on both sides of this myself, and lost too fuckin many people I love, and having people I love surprised they didn't lose me, thank y'all for getting this message out. It takes all of us to end this.
Much love you two. Thank you.❤

Yeah, dad
Haven't spoke to my own brother in 4 years over his addiction. I here he's clean now but that don't change the bull s*** I went through with him . But at the end of the day I hope he's well
Coming up on 5 years clean in May off a 10 year run on Heroin and a myriad of different drugs. If ya reading this it does get better. Just gotta take that first step. 🙏
Powerful song my guy.
❤❤❤❤
Grew up with my Dad addicted to pain pills. He finally passed away from a stroke. They said he had like 12 Lortab in his stomach. Those damn pills just took over. I hate it. He hated it. He was such a great guy. But drugs, drugs will change you. They will overtake your life. Make your kids think that the drugs are more important than you are. Please, don't ever start. It's not worth it. If you are hooked. Get help. If you are struggling, I'm praying for you. Honestly. Every day. You can do it. Hang in there. God bless. ✌️
Wonder how you missed to feature Dax in this track???????
Thank you both so much for this song. I was an addict and have been clean for 10 years…I’ve lost many friends to overdoses in the past ten years. People that were deeply loved but couldn’t escape. This song hit me in all directions and I couldn’t be more happy you guys created this song. From a former addict, thank you ❤
true 🔥 ~ real shizzzzz~ damns~
This hits so hard.my mom was a meth addict and of many times.i work with these people.this had me crying
A good friends cuz just hung his self a couple days ago over addiction, weather it feels like it or not there’s always someone out there that will help you out
Why couldn’t jelly do one verse??😢😢😢
Wtw wit a Montana of 300 ft @JoynerLucasOfficial
I lost a brother a best friend and my mother to drugs some get deep and just recently fell in love with a stranger and lost her as well
My dad likes you so much
Damn joiner, every time I hear you say some sus white shit you do some shit like this and confuse the fuck out of me honestly, you playing both sides or you just know people on all sides will understand and your just relating best you can. I hope that’s the case! I hate to say it but there’s a lot of low key racist shit on both sides, I’ve literally stopped rockin with some good ass rappers over bullshit views! Hope your one of the good ones! God bless my brother! Oh ya and I’m white.
This song!!!! Jelly Roll,  I love your music.
I just went through 2 overdoses,totaled my car and tried to commit suicide this song came out at midnight the day I ended up coming out of detox 😭 my fiance showed me this
Fyaaaa
Wtf sounded like joyner ft sam smith
This is a beautiful song. I love how  it’s both sides. I was a heroin addict for many years, I caused a lot of pain and went through plenty as well. Today I’m over four years clean! Thank you for this song. Praying for all who are struggling.
I'm a ex addict lost too many peeps cause off drugz but still wake up with pain inside me life not perfect for us 😢
I'm so old I remember when no one had ever heard of Joyner and Jelly RIP to everyone who fell to the fenty
I like it especially the two different perspectives
Beautiful song!!
I know now, why we feel depressed. Why we struggle with addiction. Why we run away from our lives.  Do what you love and you will never look back. Live a truly fulfilling life where you know your purpose and you'll never look back.   I pray for you, i found my purpose and im not looking back! I make sacrifices everyday now but i know its best for me!!
🔥🔥🔥
🐐❌🐐🟰🔥
I wish they would have used jelly rolls original voice. He doesn't need autotune
As someone who's been clean off meth and heroin for almost 9 years and lost over half a dozen of my old friends to overdoses this shit hits hard. Feel like I should have been there for em more...
beutifull song, love from denmark. spread love
This one really hits home. I'm a born again Christian and I love Jesus with all my heart. Music like this, songs like this is a reminder of the real world we live in. Some many people will never ever understand the tangible darkness that we have felt and at times still feel. Many people will never ever accept us in society no matter how sober and clean we get. Perhaps it is from the pain we not only caused ourselves but to them as well. So while we sober up and clean up now to struggle with wanting forgiveness from people. Our fight is real. But I can confidently say and boldly say we who overcome are some of the most humbled and genuine people I have ever met. Hey a big shot out to all my fellow I overcomers . Every step is progress. We are the true soldiers in this battle called life
Omg 🥺😭
This song hits so deep, been using opiates since I was 14 and then it just turned into the fent, but im here to let you know theres light at the end of the tunnel so never give up and if you have family or friends that are in addiction please never belittle them or make them feel even worse than they already feel. Have patience and try to help but also make sure their willing to help themselves first.
His got some hairy motherfucking shoulders …wow
Amazing song this is true art!!
I got a brother on meth,it's hard work!!
Great collab that I didn’t know I needed to see!
Jelly Roll singing with Auto Tune is crazy....................................................
🔥🔥🔥🙏🏻🏅
THIS SONG! I have tears streaming down my face. I spent 10 years homeless and addicted to opioids. I've been sober for 4 years 4 months and 21 days. GOD saved me. To all my brothers and sisters who are still stuck in the battle... THERE IS HOPE. There are people out here who love you! It's hard but we are here supporting  you so you can start loving yourself again!
This song hits different How can you love someone and then learn to let them go ❤
This pulled them tears out I am 5 years clean I'm 40 years old and I been an addict since 14 yrs old the hardest part is seeing all the people I came up with that I love they were my family still out there going through it
INCREDIBLE!!! I’m 5 years sober, lost my freedom for years & lost my whole family due to MY addiction, they had to distance themselves from me. I hope one day, they will see I have truly recovered. I resonate with this so much, it’s truly touching.
Been clean from alcohol since August 10th 2010 coming up on 14 years
Auto-tuning Jelly Roll is the real f'n mistake here.
This is when Joyner's at his best. My goodness. Jelly killed this too.
got my tickets 2 weeks ago for toronto, cant wait. CRAZY its a such a small venue.
The day that this came out, my cousin was found at his mom’s house, he overdosed. I’ve listened to this countless times everyday since. I wish he could have heard this. I don’t know if it would helped but I keep thinking what if. Ugh. Such an amazing song. Thank you. 🙏🏼
what a great song ! songs like this will impact so many lives in a positive way for a long time this can be a generational song on helping those in need and those struggling with love ones who are addicted it helps both sides! well done joyner & jelly
This song and dax-narssasist has been the only ones to make me cry fr
I am used to  smoke marijuana. My bros told  me no matter how i smoke but i will never be the most high😂
Joyner Lucas consistently articulates my inner thoughts…
4 Years clean 😢 Texas put me on ankle monitor, got it off 2 years ago and never looked back 🙏 Now I can live in the moment and be joyful with my little ones ..sometimes you have to hit rock bottom to realize you’re better than that and on your way up you surpass your highs in life
I have so much respect for you Joyner Lucas. I am now a fan of your powerful messages.
sure is nice to have jelly roll jump back into rap music where he started. more hooks on songs from him need to happen!
🫵🙏
Wow Joyner & Jelly, what an amazing song. Loved it! 🖤🔥
🔥🔥🔥 this song hits hard
This songs hit deep in my soul. I spent years fighting a fight that wasn’t mine. You can’t out love the addiction. By the time I walked away, drugs have taken everything from me and I wasn’t even the one doing them. Walking away was one the hardest thing I ever her to do 💔
I turned my back on my best friend when he needed me the most because I thought that was the right thing to do. Looking back its easy to see what I should have done. Never give up on someone you love no matter what. It's easy to give up but you'll be thankful you didn't. Living with the regret of knowing you could have done more is not way to live life.  Speak up don't give up!
Jelly man i hope they dont take your soul. And ur in so deep now i feel like theyll end your existence if you fight them to save yourself. Wish you luck man.
I saw Joyner then I saw featuring Jelly Roll and instantly clicked didn't even read the title just clicked and went full screen. This was beautifully done💯
4 yrs clean after being addict to heroin n coke then fent was speed balling for 15 yrs had $400 day habit. Only weed plants over pills.
Been a very long time since I heard someone really express themselves in hiphop like this.. Real.
Free my brother man this song really hit me hard
Brother I’ve been waiting for you to stop walking backwards with the rest of these folks when I know this right here is what you do you reach out and touch ppl with just music alone keep moving forward and don’t ever look back 💯
I didn’t hear from my heroin addicted brother for over 10 years, only to hear from him 4 years ago when he’d lost his fiancé and needed to get away from where he was. We bought him a coach ticket and he never got on it. Only to find out in January of this year that he died 5 weeks after that phone call due to a heroin overdose and he was given a local authority funeral with his ashes scattered in a memorial garden without any of us knowing.   Scott, I wish every day you’d got on that coach, I wish every day that you’d have got help every time we tried. I miss your silly comments, I miss you making me watch horror movies that I hated, and I miss the big brother I had as a child. I hope you’re at peace now.
Addiction IS a disease, not "just an excuse to do what you like". Downplaying the condition and blaming the person under the guise of "empowering" them is harmful and prevents a lot of people from getting the help they need. So congrats, good job, you used your influence and reach to do harm.  Your friends and family are going to keep dying because of that exact mindset, smh.
I'm in gold Beach Oregon neskia by Ophir hardtack ridge believing God healed you your family I make people piss until they stop trying covet you your family only believing God healed you your family you have a man like queen ant dragon believing your dragon makes pissants piss until they stop trying covet you your family it's his job
I'm your grandfather Adam Pima messiah David this my cross ✡️ Pima messiah Chinese m f
You have no idea
I lost the love of my life to fentanyl 12/11/23 fly high love
Looking what Chinese banned from food I forbidden you to eat that shit on freshy fresh jelly
The friend ends his verse rhyming the word "me" again and again.  Man that is so accurate to an addict's mindset.  It's a very selfish state of mind to be in.  A lot of people don't want to hear that but addicts who have struggled know exactly what I'm talking about.  It's just ME ME ME
What a great song I been sober for 6 years and it all change for me but it sucks when I'm a twin and everyday I wake up to still hea if he breathing. This drug is a sickness. I love my brother but it's hard to tell someone stop... fuck it hard. #truth
I’ll get over the heroin eventually. One day. Sooner than later. Maybe. 😞
i wish i could have said my final goodbye to you Lance. I really hope you knew i loved you im sorry i only shown you tough love. please forgive me. i love you brother i really do. RIP 3/7/2024
Love you, Joyner! One of the most genuine artists. Talking about real life shit.
My son's name is song and I do listen to it and it hurts I ended up in the hospital and when I got out I've been staying clean sober put my kids still think that I'm doing something so it's like this I'm damned if I do and damn if I don't
🔥🔥🔥🔥
DON'T GIVE UP YOU GOT THIS 🗣
To my uncle mahn... i wish
🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️
This hits all the feels Joyner and jelly. 😢😢😢
I'm on Day 22 sober from drugs.
Damn this one cuts deep
I never comment, but man I had tears rolling down my face after nearly dying from heroin going on 14 years sober reaffirms why I do not ever want that life again thoughts and prayers go out to anybody struggling. Love y’all.
I really love how Joyner Lucas does the different perspectives thing in his music…like in his song I’m Sorry
I wish I could sent this to my dad 😭
This is the lyricism i miss from you man! Glad its back!
Can we talk about the actor spittin Joyners verse! GREAT WORK!
After losing a cousin last year this video hits hard. He was just a kid and was given fentanyl laced pain killers. I hope this video reaches so many people that are struggling and pushes them towards rehab. To everyone out there struggling just remember your life matters and we need you here with us.
"Im Sorry" vibes are coming back and im here for it
Beautiful work boys! It's rare that I say that on any current rap shit these days as lyricism rarely exists anymore so thank u. A+
Jelly hopped on this bihhh!!!!!
Anything with Jelly Roll gone slap plus I'm a big ass Joyner Fan since he Came out
This is a great song. I'm sure it will hit deep with a lot people. Itll make you cry 😢
I'm sending this to my daughter. Thank you for saying what I can't say to her. ❤❤😢
Damn this hits my soul.
Joyner needs protecting man I swear to god
I just cried.
https://youtu.be/fGhZQr8tdWE?si=GZy5u7Pqa4RL2cOD
Joyner is always consistent 🌹
Man, this is rap music. This is what we need more of. Deep expression is key for music. Thank God, for all the artists that still give us this type of depth. More than appreciated.
This song hits in so many ways
🔥 🔥🔥🔥
Crying as I share this to the addicts I had to let go of to be sober❤😢
My daughter Isabella…addicted to fentanyl for 4yrs.  We don’t talk or see each other.  She has 2beautiful children that need her.  I need her💔💔  #OnlyGodsGrace #SavedByGrace
I ALWAYS say if you can’t be happy by yourself, you’ll NEVER BE HAPPY 🤷🏼‍♂️
😢 This made me cry, and I'm sure many others. Lost my brother, we all have lost loved ones. This was deep, haunting,.. heartbreak. Yet beautiful in way. Prayers for all fighting and mourning. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Adrienne. I will miss you for the rest of forever... You leaving this earth... a part of me died that day too..I wish you understood what you were doing to yourself before it was too late.
I wish I could have sent this to my dad 🪦😢 genuine tears right now
This was extremely hard listening to because i and my wife are currently going through this but im the addict, mainly due to mental health but im addicted to Xanax and not afraid to say it, it not only destroys my life but it also destroys my wife's life. Its hard its really fucking hard at times. I can't stop listening to this song because the second verse is everything I've been trying to say but feel like it doesn't matter at all. jelly roll hits as well but this song def hits an tbh the first lyrics i feel my wife thinks as well as the chorus plays how we both feel but I'm not willing to give up on 15 years of marriage or myself.
The way the first verse went from one caring to the second one in denial is the biggest truth in addiction
What a lovely song.  God bless you all.
Beautiful and emotional x
10 years sober here. Don't give up, there is hope ❤
8 yrs clean!!! It’s never easy but it gets better!! There’s always hope no matter what! Much love to those suffering I love y’all
Joyner 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hits super hard.
This was incredible
So happy this song got the attention it deserved❤️
This is what we keep making for the better of all of us. This.
2 years sober, 1 year post liver transplant! #sober ##wedorecover  ❤ Keep fighting everyone  !
Jelly roll asked his old lady to stay... she said I can't promise you that but I can promise you I will help you get your daughter back
Okey sick 💯🔥🔥🔥 and nice Shaq's on the feets
⚖️
wow
I clicked on this video by accident but stayed because his voice sounded good. I was like what the heck
Shit put me in tears.. hit too close to home. 😢
Underrated as always
I’m 3 and a half years sober now I’m trying to get my little brother that’s in prison to stop using I pray one day sobriety finds him and he finds god he’s the one who keeps me sober and helps me find my way each day that I walk this sober road
Thank both of yall ima send this to my uncle and hope it can help him have hope
They hit my heart on this one. Thank u Joyner and jelly roll. Idk where I would be or if I would be here if it wasn’t for Joyners music 💕

ياليت كل الأغاني كذا
Beautiful collab 😢
drug is not for anyone ,when you are cruel , you even ruin yourself with potato chips
My son sent me this ,I’ve been on and off for over 15 years,I’ve had enough and reading the stories and hearing this song just makes me more determined to get and stay clean!! Thankyou Sonny I love you xx
I like Joyner but he's monotone and has the same cadence and flow on every song he does.

I’m so happy I got clean…
I was kinda hoping jelly would have a verse on this one. Missed opportunity.
Powerful. Inspiring. This one hit soo deep bro🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥 Joyner NEVER misses!
Thank you so much for this song ❤❤❤❤ I had a few family members reuin my relationship with my blood family. 😢 Lost my mother because of this person. God Bless Everyone❤
😢
Joyner just hits different bruh 💯
Been on both sides. Close to 4 years sober from opiates. Fighting everyday still, it doesn’t go away. Still fighting with my 30 year old friends to do the same. It’s a hard struggle from both sides, bless who all its affecting and just hope for strength to fight every damn day
🔥 like always
I am so proud of everyone who battled addiction and made it out 🥺
🎉❤❤❤❤ABSOLUTE INSPIRATION FOR HUMANITY ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jelly Roll didn't blink once lmao
This track is crazy
I have heard those words so many damn times. And I have said those words just as many. No one knows how hard it is to give up the one thing that at one point made all of your pains go away. Yes of.course the problems and nightmares are still there when you come down but to feel no pain inside as well as outside if only for a moment I can't describe that feeling. Putting on a real smile because your past is just that your past. Dancing because physicL pai.n can't touch you right now and the horrible DayScares and nightmares that are constantlg replaying the cause of your PTSD fade to black because for just now you're tougher than those that hurt you. And the demons that plague your every waken days are lulled to sleep by the drugs that you got from the streets. No one knows.
This is soooo 🔥
@JoynerLucasOfficial is a legend for tracks like this. Here are your flowers from me sir!  💐💐💐
Been a fan of Joyner for a while now and just started hearing about Jelly, his voice reminds me of Elton John with autotune.... Didn't expect this collab but I'm NOT disappointed 🙏
Damn!! This one got me struck a nerve at work. Deep ish!!
4th year in recovery from heroin addiction. thought life would be nothing without drugs but every day is more beautiful than i could have ever dreamed of.
fact
(SORRY FOR THE PARAGRAPH IN ADVANCE…) #triggerwarning #myfentanylstory  This video hurt my heart. Being on both sides of this, being the one who was addicted and being the one who deals with her mother’s addiction, it’s hard. I got addicted to opiates at 18 and got clean by 21. Stayed sober until I was 23 turning 24 when I started hanging out with my mom more often with her and her boyfriend. He’d go and buy these “perk 30s” from a trailer that was parked in the neighborhood. At that time I knew nothing about fentanyl or just how serious it was. He told me one day when I was in the car with him as he was going to get some “they sell perk 30s here for a cheap price.” I still don’t know why he’d tell a recovering addict that, but hey 🤷🏻‍♀️ some things just don’t make sense. So I bought one, loved how it made me feel. So I bought another the next day, and then another the next day, and another the next. Then next thing you know it was 6 months later and I was literally driving around doing DoorDash for 8-12 hours a day to cover my 5-8 pill a day habit, spending $3,000 a month. I struggled so damn hard every single day man. The days that I wasn’t able to score were really super hard for me. If my dealer was out, I’d wait outside his house for hours and blow his phone up until he got more. If my car had issues and I wasn’t able to make my money for that day, I’d sit in my bathtub and cry going back and forth from my bed to the tub with the worst cold sweats I’ve ever dealt with in my life. (And I thought perk withdrawal was bad, I didn’t know SHIT until I felt fentanyl withdrawal.) oh and let me not even get started on the precipitated withdrawal I would get because I didn’t understand that I had to wait atleast 7/8 days before I could take a suboxone, so I’d take one only 1 day into my withdrawal symptoms from fentanyl and I’d go into the worst withdrawal a person could ever deal with in their life. I’d sit in the tub and cry and watch YouTube videos about the statistics of addicts that are on fentanyl and how almost 90% of them either die or never get clean, so that was one of the most discouraging things I’ve ever read about. My poor 21 year old little brother was living with me at the time and would have to watch me in pain like that (even though I tried my best to hide it from him.) so I told him to drop me off to rehab because at that point I was done! I didn’t want to keep working all day every day just to keep from being sick because at that point I wasn’t even getting high anymore. I lasted in rehab for all of about a day and a half and had my brother come and pick me back up. Everyone was fed up with me and my shit. My older sister was the only one I had left and she took me in to her home and was hell bent on helping me get clean. The doctor told us he could help taper me off by taking little doses of suboxone and fentanyl together which would keep me from getting precipitated withdrawal. But me being able to still take the fentanyl wasn’t working for me. Because at that point (like an addict does) I just wanted to feel the high, so all the progress I made during them couple of weeks at my sisters house was basically for nothing because I ended up leaving and going back to getting high. About a month after that, I tried something called “colonopin” (which honestly is a whole other drug that I could’ve gotten addicted to, had it went the wrong way, But I heard about how benzo withdrawal could kill you.) so I tried colonopin and realized they knocked me completely out cold during one day that I couldn’t afford my daily habit. And I thought “this is going to be my way out of this shit.” I stayed at my best friends for 5-7 days and dosed up just about enough colonopin to keep me asleep each day to not feel the withdrawal. And 7 days later I was finally able to take a full strip of suboxone without going into precip withdrawal. Whew was that a day to f*cking celebrate. But sadly did I know, going through that part was only half the battle. Now I had to stay that way. But I knew, in my head that I never EVER wanted to go back to living like that again, or should I say SURVIVING like that again. So I stayed clean for 11 months and I relapsed one day because of stress from my ex stealing my phone and car keys. That day I overdosed and was out for approximately 18 minutes before the first responders got there and narcan me. My poor brother found me like that, I woke up to him laying on top of my limp body begging me not to leave him here alone. Probably one of the most traumatic things me and him have ever gone through. That day was 15 months ago. I’ve been clean ever since… I must say it’s scary how peaceful it was to just be able to leave like that and not feel anything, because I know I used to think of harming myself but was too scared to do it. Now I know it’s not a scary thing at all. But then I think of my brother and how heartbroken he was that day. I know he needs me. 🤦🏻‍♀️😢  I still TO THIS DAY, think a lot about them YouTube videos I used to watch in the bathtub about the statistics about how most people die or never get clean. And I celebrate myself every single time I realize that I did it. I really f*cking did it. But now that im clean, I realize how hard it is to have to stay away from my mother since she’s on drugs, because she’s my MOM and I love her. But look at the situation her and her boyfriend got me in a couple years ago. Being an addict is hard but loving an addict is just as hard.
One of the best songs of our time hands down. Joyner couldn’t make a bad song if he literally tried
Wow
This why Joyner is goated and in his on bracket always will b a fan love this kind of music with meaning and touch the soul
😞😞😞😞😞😞😞
Needed this song.. it's hit me with a situation that recently happened and I had the question of, "why? why did it have to ruin such a beautiful time and person to this world and myself?"  and it answered it about spot on while leaving an unwritten book still open to future writings to be had.
Phew.
Need more music like that jelly voice is on point
Almost years sober from opiods, deep addiction too. Id throw 10 percs in my mouth and rock out 3 times a day. Got to the point where i couldnt find enough to not be sick and i broke down to my other half who had stood by me and watched me spiral out of control. Went from a high functioning serious addict to realizing life was about to come crashing down in 24 hrs. Every single day im so thankful she stood by me, all my lies and manipulation to continue my habit.  Getting off drugs is only half the battle, getting your bodys natural chemistry back right is miserable. I had friends die from overdoses, i was harsh about it, criticized them, then i got caught up, i no longer judge, because i know how it feels.
I am Clean and Sober for my 6th year . and I hope this song touches Millions and rattles the Souls of those who are battling with addiction. My heart goes out to those families who have a loved one bound by addiction , The thing that scared me straight wasn't so much what I was doing to myself , it's when I saw the pain I caused my family. Thank you to these artists for wanting to make a difference in the world 🌎
I like Jelly Roll, but there was to much autotune, and it doesn’t sound good at all.
Tear
Wow, this took me back to when I was a kid seeing my Mom go through it. May the Universe bless you King!!!!!
I haven't been touched this much in a long time.…wow!!!❤😮
Oh dang. So powerful
Addictions is real but it's not a disease it's a choice. Trust me I know. YOU have to make the hard decisions and the people who are around you make the differance
What a powerful song anyone dealing with this defently feels this
Brother. This hurts. I've lost too many damn friends and have had too many of these conversations. You've lived it, we can all tell. Nobody knows if you dont know. It hurts. I wish I could've showed this song to so many of my lost homies and family. Congratulations Joyner and Jelly, you've got a grown ass man crying remembering all the bullshit and all the missed time.
I lost my mom December of 2022 to an overdose. It's been a battle since I was 13-15. I had to prepare myself for that call, protect myself, and figure life out by myself. Even with all those years to prepare, it still hurts incredibly bad. Thank you for sharing this perspective, it isn't talked about enough. My boundaries were therapy and rehab, she wouldn't admit there was a problem after a certain point and disguised it as insomnia and diabetes. If you're reading this, PLEASE GET HELP! We want you here and happy.
Joyner Lucas is the GOAT! Incredible, gut wrenching song.
Your ability to convey both sides of your story with absolute empathy and grace is truly powerful. You are truly an amazing artist.  You were meant to do this.
This shit hit so hard I can’t keep from crying
Auto tune Jelly just isnt it.....
✅✅✅✅‼️‼️‼️‼️
Being someone dealing with addiction this really touches a part of my soul I thought was lost from the addiction, and damn my family is going thru some pain
I wish my husband could have heard this song 😢 I miss him so damn much. Addiction sucks.
Any drug addict that hears verse two has felt that exact way
Protect joyner at all cost
I have never related as much or felt a song this deeply in my life. I am an addict and my brother is in prison for life due to addiction. I cannot express how much I appreciate this song Joyner and Jelly. Much love to anyone out there struggling. ❤❤❤
Clean 5yrs and lost my brother 3yrs ago to his addiction 😢 that heartbreaking moment gave me all the reason I needed to stay!
♥️
In memory of Nicol King. She loved Joyner Lucas xo 😢
How did you know to sing my story? 💜💔💜
413 here MA. Recovery is possible the power to change is I. You and your higher power. I will have four years in November.
Joyner, Jelly. Thank you. You will never understand how much i needed this.
This hits hard need @Dax on the remix 🙌🏾
Just balled  my eyes out my children’s father relapsed and I’m about to give birth to our second son in April. He also has a warrant and isn’t the same man I fell in love with. This song him home like it was made for me. Thank you guys
my God my God!     Your Humble Servant AJ here.  I comment on this video as I wipe away a Tear.     I promise I wanna stop Lord! Hear my plea I don't want to Live This Way anymore, just wanna Be Free!     Exhausted all options, everyone judges, Now it's time for the Beast!    What is the use of changing, when others REFUSE to SEE!   Time to move on from others, and make this life all About ME!
yessss
Ayyyyo
Thank you for this❤
Sent this to everyone I love 💕
Love this.. Im 2 years sober 3 days ago on my birthday
Great song guys 💪
Man joyner goated
I am two years, one month, and 8 days clean and sober from meth and heroin. #wedorecover
Joyner and jelly roll always hit too hard
The old Joyner back 😤💯
BROOOO !!! Thank you for this!!  2-13-15.  My sober date. The day I began to live. I hurt so many people. But those same people GOT MY BACK TO THIS DAY MY BOY !  RECOVERY IS POSSIBLE !! I was a crackhead, meth head , pill head , alcoholic. Now? Dawg.  I’m living my best life.  No more drugs. Just me , and my family.  I love you for this my Brother , 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🫡
Joyner always hit hard, goosebumps vibes
I wish I could send this to my mom. My sister died 10 years ago and it broke her. She seemed fine and she was blessed with my other sister 3 months before my other sisters passing. My other sister is only 10 and I'm 29 so big age difference. My mom abandoned my sister for drugs and I hurt... But the hurt my little sister is going through is much worse. Drug addiction can hurt anyone and effect anyone. Don't let addiction fool you.
i could have been there.
On April 4th, I'll be one year sober. Alcohol almost ruined my life until I finally was able to say "I'm an alcoholic and I need to get better. There was scar tissue all over my liver. I had 3 friends die in a 1 year span and almost relapsed but I'm beginning to have faith in myself.
This better then anything kdot or drake or Cole can drop …
🔥🔥🔥🔥
*Being human is not a problem!*  *Being human is a FEAT!* 🕊✌
Joyner's ability to rap in the third person as opposed to his initial idea is wonderful.
Ive lost 80 friends since i was 18 and most of them are from now in my 30s from drug addiction. Almost lost my little brother to it too. Addiction kills and it sucks.
Jelly is so dope good choice to collab with!!!!!!
Wow, im ar work, on beeak dam near cryin, 9.5 years clean, my brother struugles bad, i know both sides of this story like many of us do, powerful stuff
Wat n Banger
What a beautiful song.
I had to leave town get away from everyone everything my own family didn't want me around I was hurting everyone around me and didn't realize it, so I took that time to reevaluate. I couldn't stop seeing my family crying over my grave if I didn't stop doing what I was doing. Been clean since 2010. Life is still hard but at least I see clearly now
This one really hits home.. praying for everyone out there struggling with addiction🙏🏼
This sht got me crying.  I've lost loved ones to addiction in many different ways throughout the years....all the ways you could imagine.  The human condition is so complex.
Bro big ups to you guys you both are inspirations to me and a song like this hits me where i thought i didnt feel shit if that makes sense trying and trying over and over to get clean shits hard as fuck..
To anyone battling addiction, there is a brighter future..ALWAYS. I was the lowest of lows and when you find one thing that makes you want to get clean, GRASP IT. It took me a few years of sobriety to really let go of the past. This song made me realized how blessed I am in life coming from drugs. I have 3 kids and an amazing wife with food on the table and a roof over our head. There is a way out of this I promise you! Thank you for this song. This is real life music
My stinking heart strings 😢 So 🔥🔥🔥
This is a masterpiece, I know the feeling I have a friend in the same situation.
ths is deep,wish my cousin culd see ths
"If you don't believe in yourself, you'll never believe in somebody else believing in you"
I fought so hard to help get my ex clean. And whether i got her clean or she got herself clean I’m glad she’s around even though she caused all this pain cause all the memories in my brain to be just that. Memories. Not a future. A future i would’ve done anything for. Now I’d rather be alone after what she did.
Man this tough.  Another classic Joyner 👏
I love this song very much and it hit home real hard I lost my fiance December 2020 due to alcoholism he was my world my best friend my lover my everything we would listen to Jelly Roll time and time and time again. So hearing this song I can relate to so very much and that it actually gave me goosebumps all over my body listening to this . Now I will never be able to get him back I just have the memories and know that he's always there looking down on me it's crazy.
🔥😩🔥
That shit go hard.. ❤❤

I hope everyone on this comment thread feels the love and peace they deserve. Never quit.

resonated with me. Thank you
Praying for all those struggling with addiction and the family and friends hoping they will be delivered. Keep praying and believing 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
One Collab I did not expect. Bless U guys 👌🔥
I lost a sister to addiction, she's alive but estranged- addiction is not a disease its a choice! Call it whatever you need to get insurance to pay for rehab or therapy. Get help! You're hurting more people then you will ever realize!!
Damn you Joyner! Got me crying like a baby at work. I was not expecting this today..
Anyone notice he has a Rammstein North American stadium tour shirt on?
I lost my father to drugs
This got in my feels. What a beautiful piece of art.
I grew up through home invasions, step dad being a dealer & the main person getting on the harry with my mum, she overdosed 3 times within 2 years, within those 2 years my pop had cancer I was visiting him in hospital & got a call on a number from my neighbors letting me know my mum was purple on the bathroom floor from overdosing & that the ambulance was on the way, we rushed from the hospital & got to the house she was purple still but gratefully luckily recovered & I’ll never forget her looking up at me & telling me “she doesn’t want to do it anymore”, I was 13, I’ll never forget , she went to rehab and relapsed a year after, left home when I was 15 and we’ve been apart since, she was my bestfriend & still  is but I won’t accept seeing her slowly die… including when us kids couldn’t pull her out, that’s when I knew her demons had her at hold… Headlights by Eminem would be one of my biggest relatable songs to mum but man yous deadset just bet it, 11pm at night, just after putting bby down & yall got me crying 😭😂
This song is so touching and I don't want to sound like I don't care. These two together though❤❤ I loved jelly for years before he got more popular, I'm just so happy for him.
I sent this one to my ex-wife she gave up when she she God brought her to me
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
You did it with this one, my boy. Classic!
Needed this
WOW! Very powerful!!
Nothing changes if nothing changes 💯
This shit deep
Wow I love this song so much.  Wish I could have my friend back. Reminds me alot of him
My mom sent this to me. I love you mom ❤
Way to go Joyner I really felt this i have lived this and made it through I appreciate you talking about this much love brother
I sent this to my son who is a heroin addict and he drove to my house and grabbed and hugged me while he cried like never before. This was yesterday, he spent the night and I took him to rehab. I pray it works this time😢
I am standing here to say thank you.  You have wonderfully shown all the different sides of this problem in a way that all affected can be touched.
Much love bro this song hit hard
This one hits deep
He killes it as usual but he shoulda let Jelly Roll get the 2nd verse
Simply put with so much depth and soul in this… so amazing ❤️‍🩹🫶🏻💔✨
Powerful
Felt this deep, 😢
Dude sounds like Sam smith
🙏🏼
Dope happy you got jelly on a song just wish he had a verse
Amazing 😍
Danm that hit home for me because that's how I felt about my oldest brother who was like super man to me and I felt helpless because I  do anything  to change him, now his motor skills are not good and it's a struggle for me to see him that way my heart and prayers go out to anyone else who dealing with this situation 🙏
If you need it, let this song bring you power, dont let it create pity to sulk in! I pray you find strength and determination 💪
😭
Jesus is the answer.
😥😥😥
I made it to 27 before trying any illegal drugs. Tried mushrooms on my 27th, weed on my 29th, both just once. After losing my Doberman, then shortly after my grandad, I tried coke at 32 after his memorial while out with friends watching college football and said fuck it. I always turned it down but this time I was in a ditch of grief. Fast forward 2.5 years, I was using 1/2-1 ball a day for 18 months straight, sometimes with alcohol, while running my business, breaking my own standard of biz I had held so highly to build this business since I was 8. Luckily I didn’t destroy what I’d built, but definitely lost a few clients. I ended up having a bender and psychotic episode and spent 12 day in hospital after trying to end my life. I’ll be 5 years clean October 2024. Stay strong and literally take one day at a time with simple steps to build a daily routine back to normalcy. Having a set schedule of daily activities is key to not straying and also feeling like a purposeful contributor to the world. DO NOT stay quiet if you’re struggling, ask for help and share your struggles with others you trust. I kept in childhood traumas that ended up biting me after 30. God bless everyone
I was in a relationship for 10 years she threw it all away for meth this song hit hard man
I'm Glad You Dropped This
Right now I’m suffering inside and I don’t know what it 😢
Protect these men at all costs. Joyner 2024
Love how every now n then joyner comes out with a meaningful record with a powerful message. you can tell the type of person he is. music can shift someone’s heart. Music is so powerful. God bless y’all man.
9 years no heroin. Stuck on the maintenance meds. Would give anything to wake up not dependent on a substance.
this is what makes Joyner a diamond in the rough.  this is honestly why I started listening to him in the first place
I lost my husband…my son lost his father in 2022. I miss him so much. I hate myself because I couldn’t save him. But im so mad at him for choosing drugs…but I know he couldn’t help it. This is just so horrible. My poor baby.
Clean 9 years in November
Meh
The king of both sides of the story! Respect
Jelly killed this hook
I need help. This is my first time reaching out, ive been a closet user now for a little while, im stupid because i was clean for over a year, i did have a couple hiccups which eventually led me to where i am now, my beliefs are all mixed up  along side my emotions. Jellyroll your musi lc has touched mey soul, and i want to be clean because truthfully i am terrified of the outcome that Will come if i do not stop, im discouraged yet im a hardworking genuine caring for others, well manored, polite person that came from nothing, i come from my parents roing drugs, my daddy use to beat my mom on several occasions and more, christmas was slim no lights for days, lima beans for a week, cock roaches, hot in summer, cold in winter, mold,  house to house, or staying with my dads friends or patents when we didn't have a home, i didnt have my own bedroom til after i was 18 and even then i was follish for many years  til recently afyer catching a sales charge a few years back, i sat down for a little while and did some thinking and realized im not hardcore im actually scafed but i decided i would be a true gangster a real deal  hardcore dude by getting up and going to work every day and finding a family and being a great role model, do whats right notjust for me and my family but to be thoughtful of other human beings around me and to be considerate of others and their family without hurting mine of course,  and  thats exactly what im accomplishing, i have a family now , i met a woman and her baby 3 years ago and her and that beautiful wonderful baby girl changed my life, i want to say im proud of myself but i feel like i can not be proud til i get sober  and i hope she doesn't see this message right now until i can work up 5he courage to talk to herwhich i feel almost like a coward not saying anything but as of this very minute i just dont feel like its the right time, i also have a cousins that love me and look up to me and im hiding this dark secret fighting these demons and its playing with my mental,  idong know how exactly anyone can help me before i destroy my life but im reaching out,  i dont know why i shared a lil bit of my story its probably  because  after all i been through i just know something greater is  out there for me. ... sincerely, ... brandon mccollum  From Jacksonville Florida  On 3/22/24
Jelly voice sounds so amazing
Classic Joyner
This hit home for it touched my soul because I know this is how my family felt about me thank you for this song! Once upon a time this was me #wedorecover I'm coming up on 2 years sober thank you so much for this song
Wait, the Waffle House rapper can sing?!?
❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Jelly was the best feature u could have,he makes the best addiction songs,this a guaranteed hit
I lost my brother to addiction this song hit me hard man
My uncle has been battling addiction for as long as I can remember. I saved his life multiple times & we’ve always been close, but the more he turned to drugs the further we drifted. He’s been clean for almost a whole year now and I’m so beyond grateful to have a good relationship with him again! This song definitely hits home 😭❤️
Wish would of just been Jelly Roll singing but understand what this one is for
Big fan Joyner, but as a drug and alcohol rehab counselor, I can assure you the science is in consensus on the disease of addiction. Consider yourself lucky you don't have this disease or didn't have to get surgeries, and before you've healed up, you are chemically addicted, then the pills you were prescribed get too expensive, and now you are the type of sick nobody can bear. It can befall any type of person, and it is important that people know that so they don't assume, for whatever reason, it can't happen to them. "I'm too smart, have too good morals, etc... it doesn't work like that. You have a huge platform, educate yourself on the subject so you can spread the right messages. Keep Rocken, tho fam, you are gifted.
And he does it again!!! I love it
Getting put up in another hotel thanks to my loving mother...due to my choices which consisted of partying taking cocaine and drinking I turned around one  day with a good woman a innocent baby girl and realised I couldn't put it down...innocent viticms are the consequence of my selfish decisions. I'm  angelo and I'm a addict 🙏
I have 17 months sober from H , I love this song so much and reminds me everyday not to use again ❤❤❤❤❤
😢😢😢 man this song hit hard.
Joyner Lucas has the best music videos🔥🔥🔥
This one messes me up man. Im glad i got free of those chains. Im glad it didnt cost me my life and i got to meet my wife and son's
I almost drowned trying to save someone! He shut me down and I kept showing up until it hurt too much to breathe. I miss my BF/ lover but he made a choice. It’s been mths but I still can’t even think about another man or wanting to date. This is an exact argument I had. I was stressing him trying to get him to do right be a father/ husband. He said I wasn’t perfect & he couldn’t be who I wanted him to be but to me he was perfect when he was sober! 😢I loved him he loved getting high now he’s with someone else & his pple keep telling me. He’s not doing great. I pray he gets it together one day.
Joyner has had some Legendary Ft. But Jelly Roll Takes the top spot i'm sorry
These two are by far my favorite artists along with logic
This shit hit on so many levels. I’ve been clean 13 years now. The part about not being able to believe in someone believing in you gave me chill all the way up my body. That was something that I felt but could never put it into words. Well said, thank you.
After 20 yrs of shooting ,dealing, and cooking meth I am 7 yrs sober now and this song brought a tear to my eye thinking of all my friends that are still addicted or dead.
Lourd sa mère
i love guy so much
Get this song to number 1 to save someone's life! ❤
Joyner watching your career build has been simply inspiring. Thank you.
This is a colab that I didn't know I needed pure 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Incredible
M.V better hear me play this for you in heaven!!!
YES THANK YOU
Wow the fuckin chills I got hearing this song this has been me verse 2 the past 4 years I'm going on 4 months cleans thank you for this song
Man this shit hits the soul 💛💛💛🔱💛💛💛🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥
I have struggles made me cry ugh if people only knew the battle of addiction and depression I can’t seem to shake it off prayers to everyone battling something
jelly roll doesn’t need auto tune
Dope duo. Need more combos like this. 2nd verse goes hard. They rockin some dope walmart gear.
I wish this song was made before, I’m 30 years old and parent less because of addiction. My parents won’t be here to watch me graduate college in May.
My GOAT
There it is
Great song but I was hoping for jelly roll to throw it back a couple years and spit a verse
LOVE U HARRY !! R.I.P. MY BROTHER
@boyfifty
Ima put this song on forever
Look, I just woke up. Its 6AM. I can't get ready with all these chill bumps and grown man tears.
Dear Mr. Lucas and Mr. DeFord, this was a masterpiece. You made a grown man cry, and there is nothing wrong with that Much love from me/my soul to you and yours, this shit here, mane,🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉  (I done turn to my texas slang)
wheres boyfifty credit for hook
This is amazing wow .. man you are getting better
🔥🔥🔥🔥
blah blah blah.  bro you got any or not?
Thumbnail ist einfach der Drachenlord
Damn this one hits me.. One of my best friends overdosed on heroine in 2016.. He was like a little brother. Miss his ass so much..
Could u imagine if Jelly roll got Em on this 🤯🔥
❤️‍🩹
This is by far the best Joyner album since the very begginging, the best artists prove you only get better with time, not worse.
Man, this hit hard  😢
I've got family members going through their own struggles and I'm cut from the cloth of "man up, suck it up". Joyner's verses and perspective in this song is making me realize you can't always "suck it up". I really do appreciate this song and along with the blessing of Jelly's vocals I thank you both.
The emotional music i feel in love with JOYNER....ROLL did his thing as well
Thank you  I needed to hear this song tonight 🙌🏽
Damn 🔥
❤❤💪💪💪💪❤❤
Let's go🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Great collaboration 🔥 🐐
This one hurt, but in a good way, @JoynerLucasOfficial A way that is needed for people to understand that you are not them and can't force them to see a better way. They have to make the choice for a better life.   For years and years I've lost family and friends to addiction.  Despite the fact that they were given a better path and provided inspiration toward a better mindset, I was always the bad guy because I wanted better for them and hoped that they'd see a better path in life. Did this over and over until I wasted my breath and energy so I eventually gave up and did what's best for me, regardless of how regretful it felt.  It's like raising a child; you can guide them, but overall, you have to let them do what they want to do in life in order to find themselves regardless of your worries and fears.
this what hiphop needs substance, thanks.
Jellyroll good this other guy trash
Bro is good
Powerful❤💯🤘🏼
9 seconds in; I knew this was going in my playlist 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hope this comment reaches someone. You are not alone god walks beside you and he guides me out of alcohol and into life. In an instant I was granted light and life over dark deaths.
Am i the only one that see the inspiration from Eminems song difficult on this song? It might have the same sample or soemthing. Its really dope though. Rip proof
I like how they did this vid. 🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯
Amazing inspiring I have 10 months clean from fentanyl and meth My boyfriend came got clean with mean and I already lost him to addiction again. He is back out there and I’m clean it’s super hard.
This song hits hard. Explains my life without drugs and making hard decisions
Mr Lucas ,Asibonge
This man is so underrated 🔥🔥🔥
Bless every single one of you guys going through struggles i hope all of you can get help and recover your lives❤️
💯
Old joyner is backkk
❤❤❤❤❤
Tooo hard
Rip daddy 2/15/23
Joyner isn't a rapper, he's a fuckin poet.  Just pure artist,  His songs always put me deep in thought.  shout out to Jelly Roll too adding all that soul to the song.
The feeling of this song tho 🤩😯😲🤯
❤️🔮✨
"I do it for my niggas who are trapped and working on their best skills"❤
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Love this❤
CORNY AF
Then Jelly Roll hops on a podcast and starts bragging about blowin coke for 2 days straight. I guess you gotta sell music though
Joyner man...whhhhooooooooosh! 😭🥺
Joyner is on top when it comes to storytelling in his songs/music videos
❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No single artist has given me the chills as your art, Joyner. Over and over and over again. Thank you.
Reminds me of the dad I never had a convo with. … Thanks Joyner and Roll ❤
Shit is fire😊
I was a meth and heroine addict for 10 years and for the last 4 I used the needle I bout went to prison for 10 years but instead they gave me a rehab deal I went to a one year rehab program and I've been clean a year and 3 months now this really cuts deep everyone had to abandon me because I was violent gosh😭this really hits home
To all those fighting the battle including myself if we really want it we can do it stay positive even in the worse times rip those who lost the fight  👼
this colab is insane you wanna talk about 2 people using there place to speak the truth and make a point this is it
Many blessings to those of you that got a 2nd chance. My sweet wife was battling depression from the loss of our unborn child and her mom dying of cancer. I found her when I came home from work. So I lost my wife and my lil boy lost his mom. Just be sure to tell your loved ones you love them as much as you can. I never got a chance to tell her goodbye.
O My God . Joyner 🔥
Few days ago i was out of my heart for the last time in my life
It’s hard for us you know. & it must be hard for those who love us watch us live that life. We all need change.
Few days ago i was out of my mind for the last time in my life
REAL DEEP 🤔
This one is another Grammy winner that he’ll never get!!! Joyner has that artist way and NOBODY CAN DENY THAT
This song is so deep wow
Gah damn yall really did it with this one
Sucks
😢😢😢❤
Awesome.
When is the album out
Worcester full of addiction and Dcf destroying homes wish these artist did more to bring about a stronger change in these areas ..😢
My cousin that I grew up with is like my brother, and when he was in high school he got addicted to meth, we had an intervention and he went to rehab. Now we are both 31 and he's not on drugs anymore but he's an alcoholic and he's just not dealing with his shit. And now I can only love him from a distance and accept that he has his own journey. And that's OK. Unconditional love means loving people as they are and not only if they are the person you want them to be. But that doesn't mean bending over backwards and sacrificing your peace for someone just cuz you love them. It's ok to choose you, that's you loving yourself. It took me years before I fully felt comfortable accepting this and that's OK too. ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I been listening to Joyner since he dropped his first songs I kept telling everyone he was going to blow up but it’s surprising they don’t play him on the radio smh he’s only speaking facts and realistic sh*t
Crazy Collab 🔥
I really wish jelly would have rapped a little on this song with you ik this topic hits home for him too
Of all the mfs ive seen at icp shows, i gotta be honest jellyroll was not the one i picked to blow up 😂. No disrespect. I remember he was a opener and i usually leave to get food or whatver during the oepners  but once he started rapping i stayed for the set. Mcl
Sometimes there comes a song every now and then that says every word to someone you can’t put in words 🙏🏾 Ty Joyner 7hills Wo0
🥶🥶🥶🥶
Respect all the way from South Africa
I can’t stop listening to this on repeat… currently struggling with addiction and it’s so hard…. Stuck between not wanting to be this person anymore but not knowing how or wanting to help myself. 😞
Sending this to my family that needs it,hopefully it will help them see the light
I can’t stop listening to this and crying.. 😢
This song hits all to hard!!! Great song!!!
Incredible! This is a masterpiece💯💯💯 I was addicted to heroin for 9 years! 6 years sober now and happier than ever! This song means something!!
Great collaboration between Joyner and Jelly, and additionally a great choice of message for this one.
I'm struggling with addiction and I am watching the things I have slowly become so distant the people I love are so fed up with me and I have no one to blame but myself I don't want to be like this anymore I don't want to do these things anymore but it calls me back to it it gets me every time I'm alone I'm weak in those moments I can't figure it out but I'm aware of the consequences for my actions it's like a merry-go-round of pain and suffering
Bro fr me and my girl are seperated. We both have our battles. Im sending this song to her. I cant help but think that this song was meant for both of us. JR how do you always just know how people feel bro? And Joyner, ty so much for this collab. Your music is always inspiring as well 💯. I need more collabs from yall two frfr.
Love
😭
Damn... this one hit different.
I just sent this to my aunt who was my second mom growing up I’ve watch fall victim to a meth addiction and lost everything
I've been on both sides of this situation. From the dark to the light and back again. Shit is hard man. The way the chorus changes meaning, after both verses, brought me to tears. Joyner is a different bread. Thank you for this man. 💚
Jelly on autotune is so unnecessary 😂
One day at a time. For both sides. God bless you if you are on either side of this struggle.
Remember a new clean date is better than a headstone date.
Thank you Joyner on behalf of all addicts. This song will help everyone who is struggling with addiction, who has experienced it or who has witnessed it. A great way to remember those we have lost too.
Rest easy my brothers
Alright I hear you thank u boys for the words of encouragement
yoo Joyner Luke is different🔥🔥🔥#GOAT💯
Damn Joyner u never miss bro , this was fireeeeeeeee
This is a powerful song! It definitely made me cry!
Love this collab, honestly powerful. I’d like to see more of y’all working together
Keep it up bros ❤️
Crispy ❤
Song hits close to home. 😢
💫👑✨🌟💫💥
Lucas can I ask a request next song title should be (we don’t talk no more)   and I’ll screenshoot this comment
Yo this is crazy  😢
💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥💯🔥🙏
Crazy I put these two artist on blast when I’m riding on my motorcycle zoned out (save me and legends) now they made this let’s gooooo!! This will be my next song to zone out to now💪
Reminds me of Hopsins Ill mind 5
I've lived both sides of this story. This song has incredible effect. Can't wait to show it to all my folks
Never used more than recreationally until all my brothers lost their lives or took them. Then I spiraled. I’m trying but that void is a difficult place!
Mr.lucus i doubt u will ever see this but you are such a great artist. You and jelly role are great together ..
Jelly beans sold out what happened to haystak days 😢and rapping gamgster like gambling on a white boy mixtape halfway house, mixtape
2 months and 21 days sober. My partner is still an F user. Saddest shit ever. Praying for everyone going through something. 🙏
Song has a dope meaning for sure but damn you make cringe ass yt boy rap....I'm sorry...
This song hit different
The way Joyner can effectively map out two different perspectives; the pain, sadness, anger etc so beautifully into words is amazing. He's done it with so many songs and every time it hits you in the feels.
Hearing the story, pain, and struggle from both sides was insane and so accurate. Joyner Lucas and Jelly Roll as always bringing that real Rap. 💯
my friend became a Xanax addict and now i have not seen him
Jelly Roll And,.. Joyner Lucas BETTER Receive, THEIR Well DESERVED Grammy Awards! 🏆💯💯🎙️💯💯🏆!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
As an addict, the second verse is really what people don’t see
So many people can relate to this song me and my brother are recovering fentanyl addicts. I’ve lost so many good souls to this disease. Thank god we both made it out of addiction. We are celebrating 2 years when this song dropped. Thank you Joyner and jelly roll for this masterpiece.
This Joint Hits Deep!
I respect joyner more and more as an artist
Yo j r thank you your music really gets me I feel like it was written just for me and thank you for being so humble you are one of the real ones
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤
This song hits in all the sad places of my soul things we cant change the saddest shit ever 💔
❤❤❤
Imma call this the Lucas roll , bravo
Holy shit I’ve never felt a song so much in my soul before I’m a retired drug addict who was addicted to herion and meth for half my life and homeless for 4 years lost everything I had I even lost my right leg but with the help I got from my now wife I pulled myself out of that life and am now 5 years clean own a home now and have two beautiful daughters. If anyone else is struggling and happens to be reading this just stick with it things don’t change overnight but things will change for the better if you stay the course I’ll always be here to listen to anyone else that’s having a hard time getting through a bad time in life!
Sometimes you got to learn how to love someone from a close distance
I miss my mommy. 😢
I’m still in it, how do you change if you became successful during it. There’s no rock bottom. I built a life for my family I never thought I could. And I’m a hundred times the parent either of my parents were. It feels like it makes it harder. It’s just a burden at this point.
Showed on son thus morning and now he checked into rehab. Sending to other son to see if will forgive his brother.  Thank you for this song 🎵 ❤️
God rest this man’s soul, like he’s rested so many peoples’ before him. I’m almost 5 years clean from meth and homelessness, and it’s been the best 5 years of my life🙏 I swear, God, to put the past behind me and focus forward, as you have sworn me to do; But this man has made a deal with Jesus himself, with the way his words speak pure truth straight to the hearts of many. Every song I hear from jellyroll speaks straight to the heart and soul, and I thank god every day for the clarity to hear soundly again. THERE IS HOPE for you, no matter how deep of a hole you’ve dug yourself, all it takes is facing the music and bearing witness to Gods holy epitome. I love you all!
Woooo
😢😢
I don't anyone on drugs specifically but I can relate to addiction this song hits hard
I miss her !😢😭😢
As a son of two addicts, my father dying of a heroin overdose I related to much Joyner's line. " Everyone calling that shit a disease, making you feel like you in the right. But I hate the fact that you be using that as an excuse and do what you like." I have always hated that phrase cause a disease did not kill my father, he did. Maybe I can't relate because I've never been addicted to a substance, but it must be pretty strong for you to choose it over you own child...Thank you, Joyner and Jelly, for making a song that can have both sides relate.
What a song guys....got my tears running like crazy 💯
I can't wait to work with you guys!
The only rapper who can handle a beat undoubtable
I love it. His voice is amazing!!!
Wishing everyone reading this comment a year filled with joy, luck, and health. Whoever is sad, the sadness will pass; whoever is sick, the illness will disappear. Be happy. God will bless you😍😍😍😍
💯🥷
I'm a 30 year old man who got addicted to Marijuana at age 12. Then started taking hydrocodones & oxycotin at 16. I've been sober for 10 months now and I owe it all to God and my children. I pray for anyone struggling with addiction and sobriety. God has a plan for you and he loves you. ❤️ 🙏
I'm so glad this song came out I'm going through some family issues with my brother-in-law that's addicted and he's the one that put me on the jelly roll now I can't even have a conversation with my brother-in-law because of how far is addiction and his lies have gotten I just wish we could have the time back that we had before
As a full time fire fighter, Ive responded to countless overdoses. Some we get back, some we don’t. It’s a sad thing seeing the struggle people go through. I pray for anyone that has addiction that the chains can be broken.
This song makes my heart ache like no other… sober from IV drugs for over 4 years now but this song brings me back. I’m a law abiding citizen now but the sadness that led me to addictions still exists I feel it so hard sometimes.
my two fav artists
My life at the moment
wack
This is going to resonate with the entire world!! This hits me being I am a recovering addict and I made it through!! Much love and respect!!
Im 4 years sober from alcohol in June. Alot tried me to make me relapse. I do this for me and my mom looks up to me for that. She struggled for years with drinking and it almost took her life multiple times. My grandpa died due to being a alcoholic and it gave him cancer. Just please look after your peoples going through addiction. I learned alot through rehab and thats why I never went back because I love my life more now. June 29th 2020 wasnt the day for me to go. Stay strong and please dont let anything make you relapse if you are recovering. You are doing a good job and im proud of yall.
Loving an addict is so hard.
Chills… my eyes jus filled with tears the story telling is incredible!!!
i lost my kids mom to drug addiction and i am a single dad now. we were so happy and then one day she just changed and starting using alot and after that there was no helping her, too far gone. she ran away from rehab 3 times. shit sucked and still sucks 5 years later. she is not dead to my knowledge. just completely gone from being herself and havent been heard from in a long ass time and got married to some other addict 1 month after meeting. its truly heart breaking my son wont ever have his mom.
What a POWERFUL SONG!
this nigga did it again, cant fucking wait for the album
I've been fighting for 20 plus years... Im 31... this shit is running me😮
No verse from totum pole... That's THA ONLY downside 2 this record. Joyner & Jelly good shit, stay up! -KEEP-THA-HUSTLE-
Yall killed this track forsure . Replayy
Clean since Dec 10 21! My brother still out there on fetanyal and it breaks my heart!  I pray for any addict who still suffering and hope you make it! Your not alone!!!!
I quit drinking 7 months ago.  My wife still drinks. I asked to go to counseling over past problems that have surfaced inside of me and she left. Fv<k
I wasn't an addict long but when I got in I jumped in on the deep end. Been sober off meth and heroin for almost 4 years now and it was the hardest thing I have ever done. I hope everyone can feel this joy one day.
I wish I could play thos for my brother.  😢
Dope Lyrics
This is a masterpiece.
I absolutely adore this song. ❤
Thanks & Many Blessings to both of these brothers for making hard hitting in your gut & heart meaningful music. This track really hit home. I've dealt with opiates  addiction for years  due to multiple back injuries, knee surgery and shoulder surgery and the irresponsibilities / license drug Dealers pushing scripts to patients for a profit. I've been opiates free for over 10 years but some irreversible damage was done. It wasn't easy but moral support, sports and love helped ease some of those stressful and painful days. These 2 Brothers show True Support & Awareness To This Disease. TY & ML&R J.Roll & J.Lucas  🇺🇸💜
5 years sober from the needle!
Respect family 💯🇺🇲🇮🇹🎤🔥🍝🍅⚡👑
Ngl this made me cry. Iykyk. Bless everyone that made ie out or even hasn't. There's always hope
Worcester!
Wow real talk both perspectives being in both shoes keep it up
Real talk thank you for this one
Aweee this song, hits so hard, everyday i fight the urge and addictions taking over me!! Some days are easy but most are hard!!! 😢 i love this song, made me cry!! On an instant.
immediate thumbs up
Which song has Joyner Lucas sampled for this track
Crying 😢 Intense lyrics that hit home .
Future Joyner the 🐐 ❤❤
💙🧡
I got pregnant and my mom I haven’t seen in 10 years texted me out of the blue and told me don’t be surprised if my baby dies after 6 months of being pregnant. This song hits differently. The drugs really changed her and she’ll never get clean. I gave her so many chances but that was the last straw I hope she gets clean one day.
God bless anyone of you who are struggling through addictions!
It's lonely at the top so they say but I'm still climbing up an shit is getting numb an colder but yet we all getting bolder by climbing it.
This zhit is sooo powerful. Brought tears to my eyes? Love each and every one of yall! #wedorecover
The Drifting Away Part I Fell That Shit Threw My Soul Cause When That Devil Get in To Your Mind, Its Hard To Fight Back Like He Said Their Nothing Left For Me
BEST SONG OF THE YEAR! THIS WILL WIN A GRAMMY! MARK MY WORDS!
Damn.
I'm loosing my best friend right now to addiction and this song couldn't have hit me harder ❤ spot on
Est Gee & Jelly Roll should drop a song/tape together
Unfortunately my mom was addicted when I was born and now my brother is too 😢
this shits powerful
SO powerful. 😢 Thank you. ❤
My 18 year old son almost lost his best friend to hard drugs. I held the young mans hand while he was lying on the floor dying. Hqnging on to all hope that he would pull through. Wanting to hole my son, but something told me his friend needed me more. The young man is now 8 months sober after almost losing his life. Thank you for this beautiful song.
Joyner always drops the hardest lyrics 👊
It been two years since I recover from an overdose I’m never touch drugs again
I was once the guy layed out on the ground high as a kite not admitting to my friends about using but i traded them for crap in a baggie, I miss them a lot 😢 …I now sit alone (8 years clean) 🙏
My Ex is addicted  to heroin, and meth 😢 I had to walk away for him trying save him was killing . I save him from 2 overdoses  . I have love him from distance now.
Joiner’s storytelling is so damn good!!
There's nothing that would be better then Lucas turning his music to music for God. Lord I pray you reach him, I see the holy spirit working. 🙏
Wow tears in my eyes wow yall said it all
Its Always the MESSAGE. JOYNER BEEN UNDERRATED ITS LAME
This is my favorite ❤
Jellyroll is trash IDGAF what he speaks about. His music sucks
Bro your music is the best out always some realness with a message 🫡🔥that’s real hip hop
Don't enjoy the autotune on jelly roll, mans got a great singing voice as is
🙌🏽
love it keep it up guys ❤
I asked so many many times for him to change to get better, and he couldnt so i had to change 😢
Painful how spot on this is on all levels.
JELLY
You never failed me 😢😢😢
🙏🏼💙🙏🏼‼️
Wish I could send this to my mom
One day at a time for all my people in recovery. In the struggle. Knows someone. Family members. Anyone! One day at a time!    Just for Today!
I don't know how to explain it but this really has helped me. I wish I could put into words but thank you.
This is the collab of the year!! Jelly is so good on the hook and Joyner rapping both perspectives of both sides is crazy
Super powerful song. Video is so well done.
This song .. 😢.. I listen to it over and over again
Thank ya for this masterpiece Joyner and Jelly. I just buried the father of my kids Denzel in January. Lost him Dec 18 and I just can’t believe he is gone. All the fights,hiding the drugs, looking for him, checking to make sure he is breathing. I’m so devastated that the drugs took over. I watched the amazing man he was getting killed over the drugs. Addiction is killing our loved ones left and right. I hope everyone dealing a loved one in addiction that they pull through. Don’t give up. I been clean 4 years. Denzel I hope you resting, I hope you finally free. 12 years with you wasn’t enough. I miss you so much and the boys.
To my brother I hope you get the help you need and once you need me I will drop everything for you
6 yrs clean. This gave me chills. Perspective Ive heard before too.
I am someone in recovery and now am blessed to be in school to help others. This is an amazing song with a great message. well done! This will definitely be in my toolbox to help others. Thank you for making this song!
Didn’t plan on going on YouTube and crying tonight but this did it. I’ve lost 3 very close friends to addiction. And recently another to suicide. Thank you both for helping bring awareness
I'm high on crack, butt crack that is.
Man this song touched my soul so deep it sent a chill through my body
This one hit home n heart😢❤
i am here
Joyner got that shit right. He kept switching between a family member and a lover. Both hurt. We pray both can be better! ADDICTION IS A DISEASE BUT UTS TREATABLE! Please seek treatment! U are loved!❤
dam caseho be hitting them high notes
Beautiful brother
Joyner, these kind of songs make me realize how much of a genuine real person you are, aiming to help those who need it and getting through to them with a song, we need more of you in this world
LOVE you Joyner youre a LEGEND ...
Been telling any and everybody about this cause this problem affects everyone. Whether they see it or not.
This song broke my heart. Almost everyone important to me struggles with addiction and it's so hard to watch and not have the power to change it.
RESPECT 🫡
Wow wow wow !!! Bro bro on that chorus has vocals 🎙️🚀🔥🔥🔥💪🏼
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
One again this MF don’t miss 🔥
Joyner is music 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Love it❤
They calling it a disease,it's just an excuse.
Damm... dropped 3days ago but got  to me at the time I had the deepest shit on my mind and jeez at a lose for words amazing job guys that was dynamic duo collab hope to hear more soon!! Big ups to the both of you!
battling addiction is just a way to cope, well it was for me. I just hoped it would pass the time and numb me enough to forget. Maybe it did help but the time passing did. Depression and mental illness is a pendulum , it not a one day youre okay. It comes in waves and you just need to battle to cope. With addiction comes losing yourself, lying and running from those who care, its not because you dont know that, its because it gets confusing and then you ask if you really deserve it. For me keeping those closest close and being honest with yourself changes everything, once you discover the problem wasnt you but it now is, thats when things start to change. Its never too late to get help or get through the toughest of times, become the student of yourself and learn from it all. It does get better, I promise
Just living in your Purposes man! Soooo good!!! Thank you for seeing your Light and sharing with us! More Lights in Union creates no space for darkness 🌟✨️💫
Powerful song, great collaboration!....................Every 14 minutes in the U.S. a man takes his life in the U.S...           If you read this, I hope you HEAL from the pain you do not speak to others about..... Stay Strong Kings!
If you've never been thru addiction don't judge those who are in it! You have no idea how hard it is to beat its THE DEVIL YOU'RE BATTLING! Yes I believe there are those who don't want to quit but that's the drug that has them in that mindset  trust me!
I’m 6 1/2 yrs clean from Heroin/Fentanyl. I used for 10+ years. If I can do it anyone can. If you’re using I promise you can quit. It’s hard as fuck but it’s worth the fight I promise. Ppl love you, ppl need you. May not feel like it but they do. You can do it, I know you can! Just please don’t ever lose hope. Hope is all you need and the fight to want to change for the better.
That was a soul touching song for me
@JoynerLucasOfficial bro love your style of flow it’s like a story teller but with real life situations keep up the great work bro
Jelly rolls autotune is crazy ugly.
It was to late" 💔
I lost my oldest brother my best friend to addiction 😢
Bruh. You’re one of mine and my brothers favorite artists. And it’s like you just wrote this to him man. Thank you
Omg I'm crying 😢
This hits really hard right now. Hope everyone is ok.
My father recently relapsed after 10+ years of sobriety. This song hits so close to home. I just want my dad, my best friend, back.
My husband and I just lost our best friend and brother to an OD not to long ago. This hits me in the gut like it was us talking! We have small kids that loved their uncle Mark, but we couldn't have him around them high. We tried so hard and loved him so much, but he would not talk to us when he was abusing. Miss him to the moon and back. R.I.P Mark love you!
I’m in tears
I felt both sides!?! I had to walk away no matter how much it hurt..  then i became the addict an had to well recover..ive spent decades inn recovery .. so i feel all jelly rolls music an can also reason .. being clean isnt easy but inn the end its whats best tho.. listen to every word bc i feel this deeply
How do u tell your newly adult son, that u haven't spoken to in years, that you're not the man nor the father he expects and deserves? It's easy to not face your shortcomings when they're children. But now...?
This is some of the deepest lyrics I have ever heard. I've had many people in my life addicted to drugs, limerence. this is amazing
🔥 📛 both of these guys style never thought I'd see this. nice callabo!!
Bro,  I cant find the words!!!!! This song and video hits different.
This the rap music that I signed to 🔥
You're back to your old style and I missed it so much bro  Been here since Keep it 100, I've seen that spark in you and I understand why you chose a different route  But we need people who can see both perspectives of a problem more than ever now, so please, keep this approach  All the love, all the way from Europe
Jelly Roll is the most important artiste right now. Keep saving man!
Swear this song will go to my ex wife I love u but I gotta go😢😢
Therapy Music
@MOM ='(
Joyner never ceases to amaze me.
Love goes out ❤ Einfach n Rammstein Shirt 😂
I am 30 days clean after 15 years of drugs and my wife of 12 years is still out there getting high. Broken hearts can mend but takes patience. Please pray for her. As soon as I see her I'm taking her to detox by God's grace. Love you all. God bless and give me the strength Lord. 🙏
Opioids aren’t the problem because they don’t take themselves, seriously.
I lost my brother to his choices on the 31st of Jan and Im fighting with the feeling of knowing I didn't have to preach so much. I could've just chilled with him and enjoyed that moment. Cause he would at least never use in front of me
This song is 🔥
My dad was addicted to pills til I was 11 bc of a back injury, my brother got addicted to meth when I was 14 -18, and my mother was a alcoholic when I was 12 and is only here bc the bullet missed, my sister has lost part of herself bc of pills that I'll never get to see again.even with that said my family is clean now.My best friend since I was 12, I have watched rot over the past 5 years due to alcohol, and I pray this song really reaches into him. I couldn't do this messed up life without him.this world is full of confusion and pain.i know  I'm just a small town guy but this really broke me down Joyner. Thank you.
This is Joyner from “I’m sorry “ 😭😭😭😭😤🔥🔥🔥..🇿🇦
These lyrics reminds me of a convo I had with my older brothers
“I’ve been alone so long….  I’m harder to reach” Yeah.
Two years this July 5th I was so fuckin broken man... So sick of the Fetty.. so sick of the pain . The sickness.. hurting everyone around me... I hope I never look back and hope no one returns
Collab project album with Joyner & Em would be 🔥
Anyone suffering from addiction and want a change? I can get you a flight to Cali for free and you can live out here in a nice house rent free. Come change your life.  I'm 10 months sober and doing better than I ever have.
Bro is wearing a rammstein shirt lol
Best song of all 2024 yet
RIP to all those that we lost to addiction and we tried to help! Love & Missed Always! 🙏💯❤️
Ya y'all really are sick 😷
Damn man, this shit really hit home and brought tears to my eyes.🥺😞
SO POWERFUL. I’ve been on both ends of this song……I’ve been the addict who was hurting everyone I loved & cared about…only to get sober and be in love with the addict who couldn’t get clean…..I never gave up on him though and he’s currently in rehab. 266 days sober for me & 17 for him. We do recover❤️‍🩹
I love how music brings us people who have endured this pain like this together !!! I hope everyone continues to fight the fight and if your reading this your LOVED !!!!
lit !
Joyner went to the barber and said, "gimmie the Trae Young." Somebody close to him is wrong for letting him leave the barber looking like that 😂
I wish I could show this to my loved one. Sadly his addiction stole him away at 25 years young the day after Christmas last year. Amazing song. It’s almost too emotional to listen to again at this time.
FLAME FLAME 🔥 ALL FLAMES FOREVER
This real Joyner, is the best Joyner. From way way back talking about the struggles we deal with in real life. Appreciate you brother.
Been a couple years since I lost my brother in law. A great father to my nephew. My brother in law dealt with addiction and was a real og who fought to pay debts. The day I got the call he was setup and murdered killed me. Not only was my friend gone but my nephew was completely ruined and he was just a young kid. I took him in and got him on the right track and although he still has hard times he’s doing good. I haven’t heard a song to help deal with the pain and suffering from the aftermath. This is the first and as I write this I’m in tears. Amazing song.
Thank you for TRUTH❤
Fuck I’m battling and been fighting 13 years this is hell
Got me wanting to cry
I have 274 days clean from fentanyl today. I’m thankful for each one that I get and I’m grateful I was given the opportunity to get my life back before my addiction killed me.
It saves them
Not feeling the Jelly Roll part , idk if it's autotune , but the pitch is too high , takes away from the rest
Only Joyner can do this two sided story shit ❤
5 1/2 years clean off it all.❤
lowkey reminds me of that gary song 😂🔥
You matter and deserve a beautiful life- yes you
Love this video. Love the message behind it. Jelly roll you never dissapoint
❤🙏
Putting this out there in the universe. Me and Jelly will make a song one day and it will help change the world. I promise you. Mark my words 🍀 God bless everyone

Both of my cousins died from overdose. I wish I would have been there for both of them when they were at their best and their worst.
FINALLY THE STORY TELLER WE ALL LOVE IS BACK ❤ENOUGH WITH THE MUMBLE RAP
I’m trying to find me self sorry
How many likes can I get for being sober 4 years off fentanyl.
I wanna send this to my brother who’s been addicted to heroin for years but if I do that I know I erase all the boundaries I worked hard to finally put up and I’ll just start getting used again like it hasn’t been a few years since we’ve spoke.
Beautiful art my friend

Jelly Roll continuing to make us proud and Joyner  was sensational! I was fully tickled by this duo!
i really love these two-perspective vids as they're making the lyrics and message stick way harder   🔥
2nd best rapper right here! Sorry, Em is my top guy, but you're right there with him in my book. Keep at it brother!
Damn Joyner! Your songs are so damn powerful brother! I got goosebumps listening to this. Great work fam! And I love how you cover both sides of the story in your videos!
Video hit home, years ago my 2 roommates where my best friends. One them got on Hard drugs, he didn't make it
🙏🏽💪🏽🔥💯
Lost a homie to addiction a few years back, we got distant when he was in the throes of it. I regret not doing more to help him, dont even know if I could've, but this song has true depth of meaning and really hits home.
🙏🏼
They not ready for this song 😢😢😢😢❤❤❤
Coming up on 5 years sober from drugs and alcohol. Learning to love and forgive yourself is hard work, but worth it for you and the ones who love you. Don’t ever give up. You got this.
Yo Jelly Roll is a beast!  Sadly I don’t think people really understand his position and impact he is having and can have if they listen to him.  Listen to him speak to Congress they initially look like wtf is this guy doing but mid way through you literally see them listening to the truth he is speaking about.  So to listen to the speech and then this song it’s epic.  Joyner always smashing Jelly Roll keep the movement forward my boy I see you!
This video is chilling. I hope this song/video saves some lives and bring families back together 🫶🏾
Dope ass song respect 🫡
Best of me 💃🏻🔥💃🏻🔥
fireeeeeeeeeeeeee!!
Damn 😢
I'm 14, and my mom's always nodding off so I take care of my 4 month old little brother. I sent  this song to her in hopes she will listen to it
Praying 🙏 for everyone going through it i pray yall find peace n healing.... i lost the love of my life feb 26 2024 worst day of my life but i live everyday for her i love you forever baby get ya rest...
Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 1: Joyner Lucas] Yeah, I got somebody I love (Yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (Damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (Yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (Woah) But I wrotе this song in hopes when they'll hеar it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it enough (Woah) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (Damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and you makin' feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (Do what you might, woah) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (Tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (Lose it) And you wan' deny all about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me  [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 2: Joyner Lucas] Look, I know you been callin' for me (Yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long, I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (Uh) How do I look go of something I know is something is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (Nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, I'm tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me   [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?

This song hit me deep and I can relate to it damn this shit got me feeling some type of way great song for real🔥🔥🔥🔥
Full body goosebumps
Wow this is the best
Joyner Lucas is so amazing wow. He gives me inspiration on my writing.
This is what Hip Hop expression is all about making those uncomfortable songs. To empower communities and the people. Excellent job Joyner Lucas, Being a voice for the voiceless
Great song 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I would love to hear Eminem on the remix of this❤
Jelly Roll is one of a kind, and NO ONE can change my mind 🔥🔥
As a recovering addict this song hits hard. Love it
Love it very touching plus I had a partner with addiction now he passed away 😢
One of my favorite song Joyner is always on point and jelly on the chorus just makes it so much better great colab
man this has me in tears. i lost so many friends. no lie i have one person i grew up with still alive the rest suicide or od. i lived that life a long time as well and my baby girl saved me more than she’ll ever know.  i’ve come so far in the 6 years i’ve been clean and this song just put it into perspective for me. realizing how many nights i had my mother at home up all night waiting for that call. the countless years in jail and prison. all the people i’ve lost.  i just seen all their faces flash in my mind with smiles. i just went back to my days in prison and on the streets high and sick. this song just made me realize how grateful i am to have come out on the other side alive and for how far i’ve grown since those days. thank you for this. it hurts but it helped me to see things a bit better for myself. and i been here since day one before the fame back when you were recording in a little town in nh. we actually met.  appreciate this bro
This is what I fell in love with his music for, his ability to tell stories from all sides.
My man is back, back
I havent cried this hard in a while. Ty for this song!!!!
This song and video is amazing and hits you in all the right places especially if you been through years of addiction before and coming out on top.

https://youtu.be/NSPyy-72FSo?si=obFs2AGynNVQ4fQg  I usually don’t like doing this but after hearing this I wanted to share with you and jelly the song I wrote for my dad going thru his alcohol addiction and thought yall would like it! Anyone reading this keep ya head up and stay strong some people can change but it’s up to themselves to take those first few steps all we can do is assist when you’re able💪 stay strong kings/queens!
Wasn’t expecting this WOW VERY POWERFUL! The lyrics alone…the concept & production of this video was insane! Never listened to Jelly Roll, but he was a great addition to this! Reading all the comments, gave me the chills. Proud of everyone fighting the fight and to those who are clean and celebrating being sober! Keep pushing! HUGS! 🩵🩷 #JoynerFest Worcester baby! 🎶

I relate to This song so much cuz I been in both sides of this story, addiction is fucking hard, that being said I rose up and conquered my demons and doing great now, I just wish the ppl I love could do the same, not even just the ones I love I mean everybody! Cuz believe me it can be done, all you gotta do is believe in urself and believe you can do it, even if you have a hard time believing that look at urself in the mirror every single day and tell yourself that you can until you finally do believe it then put the work in and achieve it! I know y’all can! ❤️‍🩹🙏🫶🎯Everyone

❤❤❤❤😢❤😢 how can you? Answer me 😢😢 watching from kasama zambia 🇿🇲 😍 😌 ☺ ❤ 😅
Powerful song 😢
Wow this hits home
Any body else thinks he looks like “Jey” from raw on his picture??? Or is it me?
Did OC 80's for a few years after prescription Oxycodone got a hold of me from broken bones snowboarding for years. Almost watch my best friend die on his birthday from smoking heroine collapsing his lung, and then his hook would bring him OC to the hospital on visits. Snorted and smoked OC's and after watching everything unravel, I went cold turkey, the feeling of withdrawals was the worst experience of my life. I lost my job and had no money and would buy pills with the bonds my grandparents gave me as a child.  I moved away have been clean for 10 years plus. I now have my own place, 2 cars, invested money, and make 80k a year in 1.4k hours a year. It's possible to change your life. I did all this without ever scaring my family of my problem. This song hits home so much I'm telling my small story to strangers, a story I don't openly talk about.
Nike Dunk 🔥🔥🔥
Joyner is really hip.hop.and his videos is always creative this shit 🔥 🔥  bro mad underrated becoming one of my favorite artists
Powerful stuff man 🔥
Powerful as a MF real talk. Joyner is and always will be that guy 🤝💯
💚✊
This is what you were made for.  Takes me back when my fiance first played your videos for me when you used different charaters etc.  Like the little boy, I dont want to be like you song.  It's very touching and inspiring
This hits so hard 😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you for bringing this issue to the frontline and fight against this evil government that keeps bringing this evil into the country to destroy our nation in 10 years clean but it seems like there’s nothing left to do in my life I can’t get started with my life
Deep and Dope 🫶🏼
Wow man…thank you for speaking on this
Came out of rehab today and it’s no coincidence this song came out two days ago!! Im def taking it as a message, im proud to be clean and still here. I wouldn’t wish addiction on my worst enemy. God bless anybody who reads this and to anyone struggling with addiction life can get a lot better I promise you!!! Stay strong 💪🏿…  Btw I wish Eminem and jelly roll did a song🔥👍😄
why not get an actual good singer instead of using autotune where is the actual talent when literally anyone can sound like that using it?
It's crazy how music always come out when you need to hear it the most. I married my best friend and got pregnant. Due to his drug addiction we've been separated for 6 months, the devil won my husband while he was putting hands on me, but parts of me refuses to get a divorce because it's really hard to love someone and learn on how to let them go! You don't want to give up you still have a slight of hope God will fix it while the devil is destroying our marriage a month into our marriage someone who I've known my whole life, drugs ruined my family!
Coming from a musician this is beautiful, I can’t wait to create with both of you, you guys have came so far and I’m proud of y’all for sure, go get that Grammy, ✌🏻from northern KY
Please help
Joyner you are truly one of the greats you music is always real. Prayers to those of you battling with addiction. Remember you are loved 💙
If you read this, and you know who your are. The family ain’t give up on you yet brother. 🙏
This hits hard 🙏
Heard the full song on Spotify for the first time. Then I came and found the video. Didn’t realize until the video that the second verse is from the pov of the addict. And it makes this song hit so much harder. As a recovering addict I still battle demons everyday. Thank yall both 🙏 much love. My people suffering from addiction, I LOVE YALL!
I’ve been praying for my brother for over a decade. I’ve lost hope and faith at times, but today I know our God is stronger, He’s a healer, He has the whole world in his hands. And I keep praying..
KEEP VIBRATING BRUDDA!! 🙏 💙HEART THINKER'S💙 🙏
Thank you 🙏 some of us needed this … I’m happy people are speaking up about addiction! It ruins everyone one around you and yourself …
4 years ago my son died because my baby mama did a shot and had a seizure while giving my son a bath i broke down and turned to drugs to numb my pain. I found out im having another son in 6 months i heard this song and dumb everything down the toliet and told her im wanted to stop and get clean so i can be in both there life because i was thinking about taking all my pills and kill myself thank you god for giving me a sign that i hear to live and be a father again
❤❤❤❤❤
🫶🏾🙌🏾
FIRE ! HITS HOME
RIP DAD ❤ U
You cant make someone quit addiction they have to want to quit themselves only then will they get clean its actually easy they just have to want it enough . Im clean from cocaine addiction 3 years now
Straight CHILLS! I lost my best friend/ fiancé a year ago. I dont know how to deal with it. I wake up everyday wishing I didnt. I  wish I would have got sober before it happend. Now I sit here and wonder...
Im in tears!! My little brother has been on the streets his whole adult life and cant shake the meth addiction. Ive tried to be there for him and it breaks my heart that I had to let him go. He is the only piece of our Father that I have left. And now I cant find him! I know that he needed tough love but I dont know if I made the right choice by letting him go.
❤️
I miss my friend
Joyner does it AGAIN....💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💎
DEEP.....
Damn ❤️‍🩹
It’s been a little over a year since I lost my father to a fentanyl overdose. I think about it every day. This song is so strong and resonates so hard with me. Growing up with an addict for a parent, and then becoming an addict myself, I have been on both sides of this fence. Now that I am sober and a father I want nothing more than to stay sober for my kids. Joyner and Jelly, I love you guys. Thanks for all you do for us and thanks for taking the time to write something that can touch us so much. I’ve been stuck listening to this song on repeat since it found me yesterday. I hope one day I can shake your hand, look you in your eyes, and tell you how much I appreciate what you do for us. It’s music like this that makes me want to get back to making music.
KISS🔥🔥🔥🔥

The 2nd verse of this absolutely hit me right in my soul. I had to step away from my desk at work yesterday just in tears because it felt so personal. I've had to work this year to change some things around after being, what I feel as, a constant disappointment to my family. Thank you for this Joyner.
Just power ....2 of my favorite artist..you guys are very powerful keep doin what you do
Joyner is super slept on and underrated.

I haven't felt this emotional about a song about this stuff since nfs how could u leave us but joyner I doubt ur see this 😮but this is a great song especially for those that can relate to either or both sides of this!!!!!
This brought me to tears my dad recently died and he was addicted to a drug of choice. I never got to hear how he felt are why he started it in the first place. He would always get defensive about it so I didn't want to bring it up I just wanted to help him. Miss you pops! 🥲❤️
I got addicted to drug, only my wife never left me she almost well I had to cut my finger to show that I love her for real, then she accepted me back fought the war alone, but my point is that I had a close friend but he left me because ingot addicted and fine I I addicted but why couldn't you try to save me why
Wow this hit me in the feels. Lost my brother to addiction and cancer.
Love Jellyroll but I sure do miss his raps
My father was a heroin addict all my life. I eventually followed in his footsteps. It hurt to cut him off for the sake of my recovery but I had to. Been clean for two years. He died from an od back in January. RIP POPS
🖤
I will take a Huge Dump for Every LIKE I Get!!!!!
Lost my twin 2 months ago to drugs…Only thing that’s helping is my son…
Please never stop making tracks like this. One of the best story tellers in my opinion. Keep it 💯
Joyner is one the best story tellers of this generation. You deserve your crown king 👑
Cry Out to God
Thank you, it's the song's like this that keeps me going explains how I feel ta the point  . . .
Good
Six years sober from booze on April 4th .. Joyner .. I grew up watching you open for all the big homies at the palladium … years later you came home and wrapped the goddamn entire palladium abd DCU center 3 times for Joyner fest … bruh, respect, 🔥👌❤️
I will do 1 pushup for every like i get
Hits home
❤❤❤❤❤❤

Made me cry and I ain’t like that lol
Another great song from Joyner. Souch a deep song and Jelly roll does great. Thank you both for this master piece
Man this is Picasso type shit. This man should win the presidency for this one! Joyner for president
Killed it !!!
joyner ,  joyner ,  joyner  how many times did i call you ?
Not too often I love a song after the very first time I hear it. This definitely is one of those! Good message!!!! Let’s keep spreading the love instead of the hate and glorifying drugs. Much love
This is fucking GASSSS.  This is why I do music.  Fucjing amazing 🔥🙏💯
Masterpiece Jesus Saves Holy Spirit is Power ✨️ 💯 AMEN ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Truly powerful lyrics thank you brother. And this comment section got me.😢
I literally just found this song as I'm sitting in the hospital seeking help for my withdrawal symptoms. Ive been a heavy smoker for over a year before I caught myself after my wife spoke to me and I realized I had a problem
My husband put me on to both of these artists, and I am forever grateful to him for that. We need artists like Joyner today....powerful 🔥💓🔥💓
Jelly Roll🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
https://youtu.be/E0NrAxqj-UQ?si=PamMONH6LoEY-5Qg
Jeez
https://youtu.be/7mZBRK7bIyA?si=CubGt1bngTlDgM5n
You're a living legend Joyner 😮 Jelly Roll you're very talented man👏👏👏👏👏👏
🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷👍👍👏👏👌👌
I'm 22 years clean all praise to GOD. Thank you that song is powerful. ❤❤
Hits hard home love it ❤❤
I dont post things but...I got tears streaming right now. My husband battled for 11 yrs. We went through it. He's now sober for 1yr 3months. We are healing now. I realize now that haven't ever really properly grieved all of the pressure and dispare the family went through trying to be understanding and encouraging yet balance trying to still maintain our sanity during those times. Didn't expect this song to hit like it did but the lyrics showing the honest real convo from both sides of the addiction those dealing with it and family really hit hard. I'm happy and celebrate his sobriety still shaking ptsd from some things but so grateful he decided to get help and love himself 1st so he could start to learn how to love us again. Prayers to all out there in it. There is a brighter day ahead.
We lost our friend last month to alcoholism after a 7 year battle. God's strength and Love getting us through it.
Cried the whole time watching the video. What a powerful song! Thank you 🙏🏼
If you know you know. Thank you for this.
Another ☝️✝️🔥🎶
Oh God, this is si close to home😢😢❤ still crying.....it hurt to hear this song. Years, years of addiction.  I get every word of this haunting truthful damn song.  Thank you for it❤
I'm sobbing.  I'm 8 years sober off pills after a 16 year addiction to them. I'm also the oldest daughter of an extreme alcoholic, who has dementia due to her alcoholism (she's 63). Ive had to cut ties with her because she is SO toxic and out of touch.   Y'all nailed it on the head with this one. I've never felt a song so hard before. I love both of you even more now ❤
Beyond words. Touched my soul 🙌❤️
The visual and word play is incredible. Joyner Lucas always come through
Joyner is a special artist and Jellyroll has come so far I. Dr he pinches himself lol😅
Addicted right now cried 😢
This song man… this song. ❤
Anything with Jelly Roll is a no go for me. Highly overrated.
Song had me in my feelings 😢ngl
🔥🔥🔥🚒 🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲
I remember having these conversations with my father it was and still is tough but I had to let him go
Beautiful 😢😢😢😢
That chorus hit hard. Another classic.
Amazing job Jelly and Joyner❤🎉
addiction is a disease by the way it’s not just an excuse!
❤❤
this is a collab I never knew I needed until I heard this song!! Absolutely 🔥!!
Lost my brother this past summer because of Fentanyl addiction. I hope everyone recovers. The way he couldn't.
As the daughter of an addict, this song is so incredibly personal. I lost my dad in 2008.  He was 55.  He had ravaged his body with every drug you can imagine, from opioids to cocaine to xanax to alcohol.  I'm sitting here crying deep tears over these lyrics.
This song is amazing. Lost my wife 2yrs ago to addiction, thankyou for this my boiz.
This song hit soo deep!! I've lost a couple of very close friends/family to meth. I've tried & tried to help them, be there for them,dig them out then started realizing nothing is helping. Seen what it's done to not just them but to me & my kids for trying to be there for them never once realizing it was ripping my own relationship from my kids because I was so caught up in trying to help them. All the while somehow I lost myself & started losing my kids some how down the line.  I finally had to say I'm done, I can love those ones from a distance,  I'll continue to pray for them, I'll always love them.. But for my sanity I have to let them go. Pray I don't get a phone call that those very ones is dead. Now somehow I have to find myself again and try to rebuild my relationships back with my kids. Not because I was on drugs, but because I became addicted in trying to help someone who will never help themselves..
Wow I can only imagine how many souls this is going to touch ❤
My top 5 Artist 🎵🎶🎧 Lucas
Trash.
This song is so POWERFUL 💯💯
Joyner's the Lebron of rap
Respectfully Besides Nas, Immortal Technique 🫡🫡🫡🫡… Joyner is todays greatest modern day storyteller of Hip Hop/Rap 😮‍💨💯💯💯💯.
Wow this hurts my heart…even though I am much better 😔..tears are coming out my eyes rn..I’ve been clean for 2 years now but it feels like it took my soul

This here ❤ powerful
"tell me is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?" My b.m. left me and our 7 kids a few years ago because of her addiction. Both perspectives in each verse hit home. I been in tears. I hope she calls me out of the blue, so i can show her this song. Thank you for hitting my soul with this one. Cant wait to see you in denver in june!! This is real art!!! Cant even express how greatful i am for this song
🔥
Omg! This hits too hard. May Allah help all whose affected from both perspectives.

💜
Goosebumps. You know it's real.
I'm 14days sober off liquor it's really hard right now but I feel like I can do it

Addiction sucks.
Addicts have to survive two worlds, not just one... 😔
I have so many brothers I can send this to, I don’t like that fact
🙏
Y’all keep going , it’ll get better ❤️‍🩹
This cuts deep.  Great jobs guys.  🤘😥🤘
Hit me right in the heart
I just lost my best friend to his addiction, this hit me hard

Selling what i can and escaping this cruel space... i need to do whats BEST FOR ME!!!!
Song of the year 💪🏾💪🏾
Why auto tune ?! WHYYYYY @jellyroll 😢
it was that first verse that got me 💚😭
john g trump hoover tesla donalt trump new world order reset (comment made for kanyes west j biebers new weird song sorry meat canyon yes the worship one with kanyes lip thing)super corny why worship false idols and be slaves to societies that endoctrinate you with church and make u feel bad about everything since when does god use massive pop control and ur kids to run your life and if u dont do right oh he will shun u? then u got these weirdos taking and recycling your childrens  souls u think travis scott cares about the trampling u think kanye care about u or controlling u y justin bieber too tho right well its wayy bigger and sad look at bohemian grove. free mason rule . tartaria emerald tablets where bible based of or book of enoch or why tesla knew to use ac energy  in the 40s. why john g tump apointed by hoover to take teslas stuff ask y in everything. privatization of jails. imigrants scaring americans into building walls and enslaving out of fear for own jobs. lol how bout we stop letting new world order rule us. how bout we take all resources in planet and make ai and robots and smart ppl tht are humanitarian build infrastructure so we can use acoordingly and pay the places where sources come from accordingly fair withough refineries being owned by predators rather by the people which inhabit the land area. it 2024 anything is possible even not exploiting poor and uneducated insstead bubilding africa building back latin america building back europe russia all for the people not the poeple for false goverments and idols. one for all and all for one thts gods divine grace and right so do with this paradise as he intended live with harmony share each others culture and hold eachothers hand but not to manipulatee and extort but rather to bringh light to your bretherigh and shine toghether.
Joyner Lucas is the best rapper right now and it's not even close.
Absolutely incredible song. Goosebumps. Wow
Jelly roll 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
damn, right in the fuckin feels. #508
Damn!!! song hit deep especially when you see this happen to soo many
I lost my best friend to alcohol on oct 15. Rest easy my beautiful friend💔

Ive been clean 6 years now 😭 when u lose the one you love most in life ur bestfriend ur idol and inspiration, we tend to turn to things that try to numb the pain....just remember there is always someone who cares about you dearly 🙏
Storyline, melody and lyrics, delivery, video content.........#masterclass#
Didn't wanna listen because this nigga had changed and became like every other rapper but im glad this Joyner is still here
The collab I didn’t know I needed to hear
Thank you for this. Some of your songs have made me do a lot of soul searching through the years. This is the type of music that touches hearts!!
We need to help these people. ❤
Yo Joyner😢 This probably your best song ever since 100. You deserve a trophy for this bro! God lead
Saturday I will be 5 years free from heroin. Every morning I wake up and look into my wife’s and daughters eyes (I had my daughter after sobriety she never saw the monster)  they bring me so much more than the drugs ever could or will. If you’re struggling, or trying to break  out. Keep fighting, there is light at the end of the tunnel . There’s also ups and downs, your life is valuable, don’t let your addiction tell you that it isn’t!
As a family member who witnessed and experienced this said story, this song is chilling to the bone. It tells the story exactly...great job, great job ❤❤❤
❤❤ sending love and respect 😢
I need to get my life together
Just stay…
Brilliant ❤
I have 5 yrs & 3m clean from opiates and 2 months from Benzos I remember thinking I would never be able to make it 5 days never mind 5 years but here I am by the grace of God. I went from living in my car to having my own beautiful home and my beautiful family back together I might not have everything I want but I definitely have everything I need.  I also know it could be gone in one second one wrong decision and I will not end my life like that life is way too precious I do not want to be found dead with a needle in my arm, it's simple. I don't want to die... I want to live ❤ Thanks Joyner and jelly roll, the song is amazing!
Yasssss run it up 🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏🙏
Yasss run this shit up 🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🙏🙏
This is the same sh!t I’m going through😭❤️‍🩹
WOW, straight 🔥. Well I was listening to it I was thinking to myself how Joyner was taking off but that I wished he would've spit from the addicts point of view and then the 2nd verse started. Lol they killed it! It makes me mad tho how u never hear songs like these in the top cuz they ain't talking about sex & money.  They talking real life shit that hits hard. This song is way better than half the shit on the billboards top songs SMH damn shame
Jelly roll is slowly falling off. He even let them change his voice.
Didn’t know this was a duo I needed but it’s a great song! Amazing
Banger
My ex is sober, we had a really rough breakup because of addictions. We're both in better spaces and I'm so proud of him.
I missed this Joyner
The world needed this song 🙏🏼
South Africa 🇿🇦 approves 🔥🤌... every JoynerLucas track has a message that every single person in ths earth can relate too ....🤦.... keep the stories and motivation going brother ❤... you really changing lives with what you doing ... and that's FACT.!!!!!🔥🔥
Joyner, please keep it up, man! You blow my mind with each release. You really puttin in gods work each time! All your fans see and appreciate you for all the work you are doing. Goated in my mind. I'm sad I won't make your tour in the States. I wasn't able to go to your tour in Europe way back cause I was battling addiction followed by a conviction. Hope to make it to a show someday, man!
Another song to touch the souls of so many of the unheard!!!!
Bro giving me rag & bone man vibz
Having family and friends addicted to drugs , songs like this just hit different .. blessed to still have those people in my life
This is something else
AUTO TUNE FAKE MUSIC
Bout to drop edits on this. Like if you want to see em
This is real 🎶.. 🇹🇹 Trinidad in the house 💯 love
Wow this song hit hard, just got out of a 10 year relationship due to that person not being able to stop taking drugs, I stuck by them and genuinely tried my hardest to make it work and all throughout the harder times your music helped me cope but this one is relatable on a whole other level.. thankyou Joyner, your music is the greatest in my eyes 💯
when talent and music meet 💥🔥
Touched my soul, that's all.
Letsgo Joyner 🎉🎉
The message was for me whoever sending out thank you I need to hear that thank you for sending thank you for all your blessings
Me crying at 5am to the verse from an addict. ❤
I love this song my mom used to an addict and gave me up for adoption. I’ve tried to bond but it never works. I’m 40 now I just love her from a distance
This song is crazy!!! No one makes music like this anymore
6 years clean from herion, everyone is dying out there. Raise awareness 🙏
This duo came out of nowhere !
😩😩😩😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sober since 01/17/2023...lost my girlfriend, my job, my home. Left jail yday. Came out homeless but I'm determined to fly amongst the eagles. Not going to fall victim in these streets. I don't know anything but I'm certain that I'm not going to give up. This song is motivating me to keep pressing forward with every ounce of fight in me.
Guys take this to #1 trending so everyone can know about this issue
strong, nice message 🎧 🏃‍♂️
Maybe this can reach someone who can help me or can point me in the right direction , maybe not, but its worth a try and id  like to think that its  on my heart to post this for a reason.. so, ive been a heroin/fentanyl addict for the past almost 5 years, surgery got me started on opioid pills and then addicted and eventualy got me there.. ive taken myself to rehab three times, of course only to relapse again since im here now writing this . I want to go back again and i know this time is dofferent because im truly tired and i also feel the demon of death on my back, closer than ever.. im a mother to four kids, i dont want to leave them, i dont want them to see me this way anymore, i dont want to die.. I now have no insuance and cant afford to pay thousands to go somwhere , i live in tennessee, if anyone knows anywhere that helps people without insurance who are unable to pay out of pocket please respond to me with anything that can help. Thank you & God bless you all & stay strong 🫶🏼🩷🤞🏼
🙌🙌🙌🙌
I've shared the song with everyone I know. Best song I've heard this year. Message, melody rhymes everything is fire. As always Joyner u are my last hope for real content in Hip Hop
2 years clean now and i feel much better I believe in all off you never give up trying!
This song is the best withdrawals meds ever 😢❤
Meet up at the rehab
This comment section is just a safe space fr
❤Joyner
Yeah let me get this off my chest Ever since we laid you to rest  Life’s felt like the hardest test I guess it what happens when you lose the best Friend you’ve ever had Broken, hopeless and sad Stressed, Angry and Mad I got one favor just say hello to dad  And all the love ones we’ve ever had Now I’m on my knees  Praying to god, asking why did you leave The drugs took my homie  Away from me Blinded by the rage it’s harder to see Or harder to breathe  Like George Floyd, due to the officers knee I wish you were here to be what you wanted to be I don’t know what’s best for me Taking the pills for the stress relief  Maybe I’m avoiding my destiny I guess we’ll see Wrote this to you, I hope you Rest in Peace
Art ♥️🔥
😢i felt this
Powerful y'all!! Love this!
Joyner Lucas is at there same level as Eminem, J. Cole, and Kendrick in terms of lyricism. ❤❤.  The Big 4  Kendrick Lamar  J Cole  Drake  Joyner Lucas
Damn Joyner….
Coming up on 3 years sober after about a decade of my life in misery and pain that I chose for myself. Recovery is possible if you truly want it for yourself and trust in God but it takes hard work daily and never giving up on yourself even after being beaten down so many times.
This only pushes me to release a song I wrote tears of a queen
I’m sending this to Jessie Pinkman.
I have battled addiction my whole life… this song saved me!!! 🙏🏽
A collaboration I didn't see coming.
St. Pat's day was my 14 year anniversary for being clean!
I hope we all find where we are going!!!
I love your work Joyner
I lost my brother my moms and pops and dad that raised me in 2 yrs over this bullshit. Brother in prison. This hits SO FUCKIN CLOSE
just celebrated 20 years clean. never thought id see my 40's. fuckin hell, im crying. Reach out if you know someone whos struggling. and if you're fighting the fight against it, just know that there are so many people that believe in you, and want to help.
❤ 🤗now i can relate......
As someone who is surrounded by addiction and lost my mother to that battle. I needed this. Thank you, Joyner and Jelly. 💜
Joyner back ✅✅✅✅✅
Thank you for this
That fit tho, them dunks are fire. Very touching song specially when they don’t want you making song to help those in need.
My husband has been clean for 10 years, so I'm proud of him
Now this is music 🎶
I dedicate this song to my best friend, who is addicted to Heroin
Turned all the way up in the s2000
My soul literally needed something like this for a sense of self-clarity... This is everything right now. AND THANK YOU for making it a priority to have both sides of the song's perspectives. its an amazing track
Another Lee here!
I just lost my mother to alcoholism. I needed this Jelly thank you
So many my homies gone from drugs and murder this shit hit close
Reminds me of the fights I had with my mom about her Crack addiction rip mama dukes
https://youtu.be/3rIjVnCU1rg?si=Lgw0RtR-FxNj0Q4I
This song is gonna hit people on both sides of addiction and it will for years to come. Never thought I'd hear a song that will live as the middle ground everyone can meet on with addictions.
I love the fact that after he goes off on the guy for "preaching" he dumps the pills out. Sometimes you gotta let out your thoughts in order to get over them. Soemtimes its not that simple. Sometimes you have to let them hit bottom and that is the hardest to do.
finally again Flow-Joyner song
I love it is amazing song thank you joner you always  the best rapper ❤❤❤
To everyone that's sober that's fighting demons every day we got this, remember we go through hard time's for a reason...lets get it #SOBERNATION!!!!!!!!
I’ve been struggling with Heroin for 7 years, I’ve been in an out of rehab but no matter what I do I couldn’t stay clean. Like rehab helps you get clean and stay clean but once you leave those doors you are on your own to keep staying clean with the cravings getting more challenging every second. It doesn’t stop, Heroin took the joy outta of me I couldn’t find anything to fill the void, it’s like nothing is fun to me anymore. I couldn’t play games or watch movies without feeling bored or depressed. No matter what I do I keep losing to drugs 😭 I lost the love of my life, my queen my wife, she didn’t want nothing to do with me anymore, she even told me it’s me or your drugs you choose. I have the most depressing life ever, I even thought about killing myself since she left cause without her I have no purpose in life she’s everything to me. I thank god every day that I’m still alive, I even pray for to god for keep me alive an even make my life better. I just turn 29 years old the 3rd of March. I know this is my last chance to get sober cause nobody fucked up my life other then myself, I want my wife & my life back so I’m begging everyone to pray from me 😭💔🙏🏽
this song hits very deep, my father never use to Drink but in the past 3 year he started. we dont know what is  wrong or what he is fighting cos he is a strong man  and a very good man. I love this man
This one connects so well, Joyner is a genius 🔥
I'm in recovery right now, only 29 years old and been using herion then fentynal and dope for more then half my life.  I pray this recovery is all that I need. I love life again, and more importantly I love myself again, and this song hits so hard for me. Thank you Joyner and jelly roll for this amazing raw ass song.  I've been on both sides of this song now, I'll never lose hope on any of my loved ones that one day they will walk this road of recovery with me and they can embrace this life also. Anyone reading this, please pray for me to not fall back down,  most importantly pray for the ones still lost to this that they will find their way to the light.  🩵🖤💚💜
Hats off!!! You are both lyrical geniuses!!! Yall spit them words that hit us right in the soul!!! AMAZING
Love this song great message for those in difficult times or addiction.  Blessings to all!!!❤😢
🔥
Man , this song bring back memories of when my older brother was addicted to meth and we went through hell.. idk what finally snapped in him but he’s been clean for almost two years now and just for everyone else never give up on them and love them ! They need it the most 🙏🏽
Joyner has always been real as fuck love this.
Dane Cook bodied second verse! 🔥
fam this is beautiful, i needed to hear this, been struggling with mental health and its painful to love someone and have them not understand what you going through, we end up giving to addictions because we feel unheard especially when you have a borderline personality and disorder, adhd, general anxiety disorder and have rejection sensitivity dysphoria
This
And this song saved me again was thinking some dark thoughts but this pulled me out of it !!!! Words can carry some serious weight
Man this made me ugly cry..I feel this with my family so hard..let’s all pray for each other and always give love for our people ♥️♥️♥️
Thank you for this one !!! Youur music saved and helped me to change my life I'm a drug /alcohol adict and this song /video hits really hard thank you joyner lucas/jelly roll legends of our time churr thank you

Fuck joyner back with the deep shit! My favorite type of joyner!❤
❤Incredible song\message.❤
Thank you so much for this song,I lost a brother and sister to drugs and my other brother is still in his addiction,I needed this
I have not had a drink for 107 days today n this time it's easy. I just remember how shit it is if I do n it's enough now, i dont want to party n do drugs I want peace, I choose my path. Choose stayin in the present moment n getting good shit done, it doesn't have to be much but little wins add up. Day by day it gets better.
Holly shit I ain't even got words but  I love it. ❤️ Joyner and Jelly Roll killed it.
Using drugs as an escape route and excuses to get away from problems you don't want to deal with. Reality never leaves. Its yours, because you created it. Its you're universe.
Im 472 Days Sober❤️
1 like = 1 push-up video proof
Joyner bro, you're a freaking genius,  ❤ much love to you bro this song is awesome,  good job to both of ya
You did it again!!!!
Another banger.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

This is what we need in America,more awareness because I've been fighting the battle since I was 29 and now 46, just lost my brother to drugs,I've just about everyone around me but I refuse to lose me!!
The actor crushed it. This was like a lil movie 🎥
this shit hits hard…..wow. The words are so powerful….
This hard as a motherfucker
Growing up with a father who has been in jail and out of jail for all 29 years of my life for meth and more. It destroys me, came into my life at 15 years old and consistently repeats the cycle.
I would have threatened the cab manager with operations violation fines for non-compliance. "3 cabs with expired tags still in operation, this facility has not paid taxes in 2 years, 2 cabbies with warrants, fire inspection tags overdue, and that man - is playing Galaga!"
Tbh what this song ended up being about I did not expect. But this shit really hit home run real hard 🥺💔
i cried through 95% of this holy shit
I’m crying 😭- Listening to this on repeat 🔂
Damn the combo we all needed ❤️💪
joyner has a purpose! and we see that purpose 💗 thank you sm for this beautiful masterpiece much love
Damn.
This gives me early Joyner vibes, the story telling is perfect!
This guy is too amazing ❤
This!!!! Holy fuck! Today is my 115th day 100% clean after 7.5yrs In active addiction to meth. Thank you Joyner and Jelly💕 Every morning I wake up and thank God for pulling me outta the deepest pits of hell, but I will continue to pray for those still battling, and hoping y'all too can come out on top ❤❤
Joyner is so underrated. People sleeping on him. Beautiful song. Made a few tears fall. 💞
Absolutely amazing message!!!! I'm been pulled from the darkness of addiction recently hit 9 months, and I can wholeheartedly say this song absolutely needs to be heard! Thank you for your music brother!
A masterpiece gentleman
🙏🏿💜✝️
That 1st verse is amazing when you're on the other side of addiction and in active recovery. Just wow. Reminds me of my old self.
This shit is crazy... Broski level... 🔥

❤🎉Absolutely fire
Lost my baby brother 3 months ago after we got in a fight and never got to tell him I didn't mean it and that I was sorry.....so don't hold regrets in ur heart tell ALL of ur loved ones u love them and don't take this little bit of time we have on this earth for granted!!!! Loved this song hit home hard...
My gosh !!!!! 2 talented man in one Video <3
I'm feeling this for real.This some real heart shit
Man this song hits hard especially cuz my lil bro n prison n not dead😢
Yessir this is a straight banger 🔥🔥
This man speaks how we feel great song
This is fucking heavy. Love it. Thanks Joyner.
This is why he's one of the best rapper this generation look at the message in his songs man this is right up there with sorry and for him to have jellyroll In there he smashed it
Been here since Ross Capp and Welcome to the Traphouse letsss gooo!!!!!!!!!
Losing people to addiction and hearing this song just gave me straight chills thank you for this hopefully this helps other before it’s to late🖤🙏🏻
Much props of being able to SEE both sides.
This song literally took my breath away.. sent me into a panic attack,  sobbing, praying to God because he's all I have left when they're all gone. I can't save them only God can do that , Lord knows I've tried. My heart is so tired & I MISS  my people more than they'll  ever know!  I'm lost without them. When you love an addict you're in a constant state of grief. You mourn them every day until one day its at their funeral  & forever after 💔
🙏🏾😢
Just one word {redemption}
So powerful!!!!
felt this in my soul. absolutely incredible.
I was fixing to take my life the other night when I saw this song which I had been waiting because I loved the sample you had uploaded.  I was preparing to jab my 6" Cold Steel knife into my carotid artery when these lyrics hit me... I'm dealing with a wife of 10 years who has been cheating on me multiple times in the past 3 years and been badly addicted to pain pills for years now.    I was at my breaking point Joyner and Jelly this song saved my life...for now but ever the past day I've listened to this 100 times now since uploaded.  I was fixing to leave my 9 year old daughter and 7 year old non verbal autistic son with a mother that is unfit  If I ever do decide to go through with it this will be my last song I listen to before I go.  Thank you so much Joyner and Jelly for this song you've given me the strength to go through to see another day.  This is on repeat all day long
I just don’t get why you had to auto tune Jelly’s vocals so hard
Never thought I'd see this collab in a million years, very good!
This song hit hard... I'm clean and sober now . . .  But I have someone who I'm losing to addiction.... again.. 💔
I’m a recovering addict (been clean for almost 18 months) and this song just hit really hard, I’ve always been a fan and this just brought me back. Thank you
Joyner… you have no idea how much you’ve helped heal my broken lil heart. You’re a real one man you really are.
God damn jelly. Joyner always delivers. Lost my best friend last week to drugs. This is an absolute banger thank you gentleman
Re-shoot the whole 2nd verse with a better actor. That ish was Taylor Swift flat.  That guy stunk it up.
Sh*t hit home… frfr😢
Jelly roll did his thang on here…Joyner always cut up so Ian ema speaking of dem flames….Rap at its peak is dis💪🏾🚀🙏🏾
Joyner you saved my life! My boy! Love your music and your messege...
2 of my favorite artists
Absolutely beautiful song A Fuxking plus 🔥 💜
This hit hard… 12yrs clean & I pray whoever is out there struggling can do the same 🙏
Jelly roll you just made a new fan ✊🏾💯
Joyner you are amazing! Your way to bring light on real issues dopest. May God always protect you.✊🏾
💎✨️
This song couldn't have come at a better time. This song was the push my brother needed to finally get the help he needs. Thank you jelly and Joyner for this masterpiece. The world needs this to heal
thanks for writing this. it means a lot to know other people have a hard time with knowing how to help someone they really care about who is going through hell. I want to be there but don't know how or if I'll just make it worse... thx to the comments too - gives hope to know that people make it through, even after a long time being down bad.
I’m 16 and most people in my life were addicts or are addicts, I’ve lost and gained, and let me tell you drug addicts who are parents, if you would rather party with drugs now then deal with your kids, then yall are gonna have a rude awakening when yall want to be in their life again whether your recovering or not, you can’t just jump in and take your rightful spot thinking things are gonna be peachy me and my mom are going through that right now. Quit now and start life.
great song, it hit deep. I will have 12 years at the end of the year clean from pills and herion, i never thought i would make it past 21, did multiple rehabs and halfway house.  I just woke up one day crying in my moms basement. I was so tired of living that life. Now here i am 12 years later and i never thought i would be as far as i have come. I have a beautiful wife and 2 beautiful daughters. Just bought my first house. life is good, blessed to wake up everyday.  If anyone is reading this and still using, dont give up you matter the world needs you,  One day at a time. Much love
hola
Never misses! This guy! 😢
Joyner DIFFERENT👍
Waited patiently for this to drop
Great work as always, especially enjoyed that second verse. Cheers from Germany
Wow. Just wow. joyner NEVER misses.
Hope all this reaches will be able to find their way
This shit was absolutely beautiful
❤❤😢
This song is fucking nuts. Joyner u are something else man.
Rip bubba... You were a great dude with a fucked up sense of humor like me! I wish you could've beaten your dragon you were chasing since you were 18... You will be missed ❤
😢😢😢
Thank you for saying it out loud............................ you did.......... i can't  @joyner
This song hit me hard. Lost my brother to addiction. I broke down listening to it today. 😢
This is a real song unlike that shit cardi just dropped 😅
I wish my mom would listen 😒 she’s still around and I miss her more then ever
The 2nd part sounds almost exactly what my boys father has told me 🥺and that’s scary 💔
i wish i could’ve reached out to one of my best friends before he left us. i miss you man 😞 RIP
Joyner is dope but Jelly roll makes it all come together 💯💯🇰🇪🇰🇪 dope message 😢
This was everything! Man.
"And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me"  It can be a disease, but also the problem can be me. I had to accept both those things to get sober. I thank God for the people that told me straight that my problems were of my own making.
I cried 💯 %. I hope to God this wins every Grammy possible! I hope this reaches beyond anything we've seen. Beautiful from start to finish.  Thank you brother!
Awesome collab 👏👏👏 Great job!
Just lost a close friend of 30years  to this sh*t saturday. It's a sad part of life.
Yes he truly does deserves everything ... Joyner Lucas ❤
Incredible song
This song fire🔥🔥🔥 this duet is 🔥🔥🔥
Nicely done guys! Pure 🔥!
This mother fucka Joyner just spit the back into all of us. This shit hit deeper than the ocean 💯
👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
I just wanna say I lost a good friend of mine to a overdone less then a week ago. I couldn’t have found this song at a better time🖤
Yo @JoynerLucasOfficial you are always on point my dude..Much love for this song fr..But Ayyy Jelly killed the vocals i didn't know bubba could hit them highs like that @JellyRoll
Hits home from every point of view… amazing song
Thats eminem dad 😂
Ty Joyner and jelly we need ppl like yall in this world
I been battling addiction last 10 years of my life.. a year sober.. divorced twice.. it doesn’t get any easier being sober.. in fact it is harder…
Sad thing is this song and video won’t win a Grammy but let someone drop one tiktok viral song and they’ll win 3 Grammys next year
You couldn’t have picked anyone better 😢❤❤
The kick drums are crackling bruh 🫤 . Y’all should let me be your sound engineer 😮😊
This one feels different ❤ I've got 5 years 4 months 3 days clean.  I never thought it was possible.  It can be done. I spent almost 40 years chasing this heroin. NEVER AGAIN! 😊
As someone who grew up with parents addicted to drugs, this one made me cry a little bit. This is EXACTLY how it feels on both ends
Wow!! Amazing song
What a great collaboration Joyner and his story telling of both sides of the story. I know this battle all to well. I am not giving up on her she can make it because I have been in that same spot.
This song hits hard! 🔥🔥🔥
My name is Craig and I have been clean off drug for 6 years now I can say I my myself now
JOYNER I GET WHERE YOUR COMING FROM BUT IF YOU REALLY CARED ABOUT ADDICTS, you would have a different view. This song  just tugs at the heart strings of the uninformed and jelly knows this there are 2 sides to addiction hence Jelly rolls song GLITTER look up Caseys LAW and Charlotte Wethington’s these are real people known in the streets to make a difference but media never talks about please for the love of GOD stop with the STIGMATISM!
I don't make comments often on any platform but this shit here made my soul cry 💯 I've had these conversations before trying to help both of the baby Mothers that I have but unfortunately 1 passed away in 2021 and the other is still suffering from addiction it's a painful feeling to have when your children misses them but you can't do nothing about it 🤦🏿‍♂️
I wish my dad could’ve heard this, thanks for the song, real hero man
💔💔💔💔💔💔💔🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻😇😇😇😇😇🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
this hits hard, love this track.
So damn powerful
I love you, incase you havnt heard it enough <3 Dream colab is with Joyner

🗣️🗣️🗣️FUCK!!!!!! 😢😞🙏🏼
Man this hits so deep. God bless Joyner & Jelly for sharing your art and pain
I sent this to my son who is a heroin addict and he drove to my house and grabbed and hugged me while he cried like never before. This was yesterday, he spent the night and I took him to rehab. I pray it works this time😢
Rule of Holes  - it stops getting deeper when you stop digging. Regrettably, we can't Make someone quit  - They decide when it's time to quit digging. Addiction cannot be Reasoned with
Listen how they massacred my boy. Song is still dope though.
I've set a date for my trip to rehab for alcoholism, and it's a song like This that helps me feel I'm making the right choice. Bless you all, and may our lives be filled with peace and joy.
I’m glad you never changed 🐦‍⬛ and even if you did you turned around and seen him. Amen 🙏🏽
Dam
AMAZING
Amen🙏🏻🙏🏿🙏♥️♥️♥️!
THIS SHIT BETTER GET A GRAMMY! 💜💜💜💯💯💯

This touches me deeply, man 😢😢😢😢😢
First of all… I ain’t listen to it, I downloaded it straight, because I MF know that this shit is Litty like a MF Titty 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You can't help anyone with their addiction if you don't help them resolve the trauma that caused the addiction, which on itself is not easy to do without the help of professionals. It's a team effort cause without people close to the person with addiction in the picture, it's very hard for professionals to find a opening in the armor.
All my early 20's i was in addiction.  Im now almost 31 and 6 years clean! Its possible if you dont give up. I pray for my family and friend's still battling everyday 🙏
.🔥🔥🔥
Joyner's back
I don't know why it reminds me of my song Sunday nights.
I’m the 1% 1 day at a time  God’s grace  3.5yrs clean  Miracle   Thankyou JESUS!!!!!!❤
JOYNER LUCAS MUSIC HAS ALWAYS SPOKEN TOWARDS ME WITH HIS LYRICAL WORDS ( ESPECIALLY -ADHD- ) AND JELLY ROLL HAS JUST HIT MY LIST BY JOYNER LUCAS AND TO SEE THEM BOTH DO A SINGLE ON STRUGGLES IN LIFE SPEAKS TO ME IN SO MANY WAYS JOYNER LUCAS YOU NEVER DISAPPOINT ME WITH YOUR WORDS YOUR SONGS AND MOST OF ALL YOU GET US BRO.
Hope you release this song again with Jelly's raw vocals.  Its a subject he is passionate about and know it would come through in his voice more than the autotune.  Love the song and your music!
Illuminati
My brother just pasted away I’m sorry i wasn’t there more for you I never could understand and im just sorry I hope you not hurting anymore watch ova us until we meet again
Joyner hitting 2 perspectives in songs hits different and makes it insightfull. love this one
My grandpa was always there through my addictions and I recently lost him about a year ago to agent orange it's a cancer he picked up in Vietnam as he was serving his country USA. I went to jail after hearing about his death. All I wanted was my girl around and I ended up in a cell alone.
This guy's deserves a recognition just like cole and Lamar he can also story tell 🔥🔥
It's crazy when you realize you ain't alone Joyner I Love you man for creating this!
Real rap
it’s HATE…..i HATE drugs alcohol from my sis who’s on drugs don’t know if she is alive as of this day…..to brother JOHNNY GRUNGE ECW / WCW star hOOked on soma muscle relaxers who ODd from them….. I HATE 🤬 I HATE 🤬 I miss both…..👍🏻👊🏻🫵🏻😂😇💔
Joyner dropping fire as always🔥🔥
You know the addicts hearing this listen to the first verse like it's nothing, heard it a million times, and you know the other side turns the track off in the middle of the second verse.  Wouldn't be okay with any other illness, glad you got a pass, godspeed.
This one straight up made a grown man cry 😭 Real and Raw. By the grace of God I have 11 years sober but this right here is so damn relatable. 💯💯💯
"If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you" that line hits crazy bro.
🎯🎯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn, this song hit me. I did not expect that. Well done.
I honestly can't think of a better person to be on the hook. Jelly Rolls voice is crazy and dudes so talented.
To anyone going through hard times right now, don't find a way out of your situation, find a way through.
I love how joyner uses other ppl to recite his verses when it's another person's perspective #GOAT #NNIB
Thank you for this.
I’ve been on both sides of addiction. Seven years clean this year. This song is beautiful. This is what music is supposed to be. God bless you Joyner and Jelly 🙏🏻 you’ve made a masterpiece. Please, if your battling with addiction, find help. It’s a hard road but the grass is greener ❤
My guy jelly killed the hook
Joyner or Jelly never disappoint, this is the music the world needs.
I feel this song to a T. I dedicate this to my husband..
Got that Stan flo M&M
Kendrick, Cole < Joyner
I love jelly roll but songs better with out his part
Loved Joyner since middle school man I love how he can connect to you through his words ❤️
The old Joyner flow💪 keep it up man ain't no better storyteller than you, my opinion you better than Tupac or Biggie combined also Eminem but you guys are cool ik, you just gotta take his place now🤣
7 months clean from the fentanyl and the trank from Kensington PA. Only 29 and I wanted my life back. Remember you’re not alone.
Such a powerful song

You really snapped on this.   Hit the nail on the head.         From personal experience and friends too.     Joyner pen is different.
That second verse hits differently 🎉
Facts 💯💯 💯💯💯💯💯
Not sure where to even start as I'm typing this but I am 27 and my mother who has been struggling with alcohol addiction for the last 4-5 years just passed away on March 7th, 2024 at the age of 57... We still don't know exactly what happened but she passed away after trying and ultimately failing to walk home from a nearby hospital that she had been taken to after I found her in her room having fallen down drunk and hit her head... Hearing this song and in particular the lyrics of the chorus, "how can you love someone and learn to let them go", hits me extremely hard for so many reasons, not least of which being that I was not ready to lose her and now being forced to let her go is the hardest thing I have ever had to go through, but also because I had tried more times than I can count to get her to stop drinking and go to treatment or get help but to no real avail and had spent the last few weeks before she passed giving her space and not really talking in the hopes that since all else had failed she would reach out when she was ready only for her to end up getting worse and passing so unexpectedly and now that she is gone I cant help but wish I had done more or tried harder to get through to her or even just been there to try and make the most of the time we had left... It's been weeks and I have struggled everyday without her but I felt compelled to share in the hopes that maybe my story along with this song and the community here can help someone going through something similar, even if its just to let them know they aren't alone... Thank you to Joyner and Jelly Roll for your beautiful art and R.I.P. to my beautiful mother Lydia, I love you always and forever
Damn. Another banger as usual. Real shit real talking as always. 🙌❤️🔥
Real messages through Grammy award type of music with expert lyricism and a dope hook!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2 🐐 but Joyner yo tully thing rigged fr
7 years clean !!
i respect Joyner and Jelly Roll. They made very cool and emotional song. ❤‍🩹
This song is doing MR. Beast number’s
Best work since his I aint racist song
I have recently become homeless with my four kids there mother is addicted and now I find myself slipping too this song hits heard! Please pray not for me but my four innocent children!
This song gave me the chills!!!! 🔥
Visceral definition of tough love.  Incredible what you're doin here- Joyner
This hits deep. Ive dealt with addiction soon as i was born my parents were addicts and then i became one myself, im 34 now and still here fighting unlike my mom and over half my friends whos battle was cut short due to drug use. Its a vicious cycle thats hard to break. Thanks for this great song it definently will help me and others on our journey. Keep killin it joyner and jelly.
My best friend died Like this. 😢❤
This song made me cry. My fiance is struggling with addiction so bad. I know that I'm gonna end up going to the funeral of the woman that I love more than anything on earth and it truly kills me. I've been trying to get her help for so long. I feel like I have to walk away but I just don't know how.....
It’s good to see a song about why you should not do drugs as opposed to all the songs out there about why you should do drugs.
Somebody Out There Is just Motivated.. Big Ups Big Bro. GOAT!🎉
damn, this touched my soul to the root, thanks brothas for making this song
Great - Production (Loved the warm touch of the drummer) in combination with the 808, and the vocal production, the video etc. Well done bravo 👏   https://youtu.be/V0H8oGWkn0Q?si=M_BSo2Q_P1o7dIY9  I also sing if one day you want to collaborate 🎉🎉🎉
❤ this is so beautiful thank you for putting it out there for people to understand what addiction is about
This song comes out when i get out of rehab 🙌
Joyner don't miss! For some time now I've been saying to myself that he is the GOAT. He does not disappoint and I still feel the same way to this day.  This is real music/poetry!
A COLLAB ID NEVER THINK ID SEE
Damn life just went full circle for me. 1st of all i used to cop H from joyner out in wooster & Fitchburg. Ive been clean since 1/19. & now im watching my sister lose her battle with addiction. Dcf just took my neice & nephew from her on monday & shes been on a 51/50 hold since then. Its wild
If this song dont when a grammy that would be sad mane but best song i heard in a while
This hit home
This shit makes u view at your addictions differently......
Jelly's voice is waaaaaayyyyy too modified in this song
I love this song
"Addiction is the only prison where the locks are on the inside" RIP to all my childhood friends that lost the fight 🙏🙏❤❤
Great song
Joyner is a god to me.
Dope
Instant goosebumps man! Yall this song has me speechless. Another song to add to our list our Playlist at home. ❤🫶
Really like some of the points made in this song. I believe addiction is a disease but also believe too many people use it as a crutch to justify their actions and relieve themselves of some of the responsibility of choices made.   It's an insanely complex topic to summarize in a song but at the least this highlighted a portion that doesn't get talked about as much lately. Nothing is black and white.
My gawd bro….. Nobody does it how u do it 🫡 Artist almost an understatement
Absolutely love this song. Close to home.
🔥🔥🔥Love ur Music bro. Keep it Up 🔥🔥🔥  Greetz from Germany 🔥🔥🔥
1:14 👏👏🤜🏾🤛🏼
Joyner n jelly roll 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Every time 🔥🔥🔥
Great duo
Joyner is one of the best story tellers alive right now.
This song was so meaningful
This definitely hits home💔 I pray for everyone who has an addiction 🙏🏾 ❤ I so love this song
This is exactly where i am at with my BM now. Sad, 8 years and nothing has changed. I broke my self trying to fix you.
For 10  years I was strung out on heroin, went to jail for robbing banks, lost my 3 young sons, and still couldn’t straighten out.  Ex. Celitic is my childhood friend, we grew up togeyher, I  lived with him in Fresno CA. when he played for Jerry Tarkanian and the  Fresno Bulldogs… We snorted coke every night and he still put up 30 a game!   Years later we were all strung out on heroin and Chris had recently gotten clean after playing for the Boston Celtics and there I was dope sick in some room in Fall River, Ma and a girl said, Gerry! Theres a Chris on the phone…   I had just finished throwing up, was shaking from the alcohol and bezo detox along with the dope, I was 48 hours into a Cold Turkey detox attempt… I was Broke financially and Broken physically, emotionally and spiritually.  I answered the phone, it was Chris Herren. He said, “what are you doing?” I told him I was broke and couldn’t cop. I asked him if he could get me something…   He told me he was sending a car. Another friend of ours who had gotten sober 10 years earlier picked me up and brought me to his house in Cape Cod.   I got clean for the first time in several years.   I owe him my life and some.
Drop a song w/ MGK plz
Joyner never misses. Thank you for the work you put in. God Bless
3/29/20

❤I .m lost for words on this. This is one of the realest most powerful songs I have heard in years! It is so much more than amazing!

Man this song hit me hard
2/14/20 clean date. This one hits home
Now This is a real Message to the world!
Sick ass RAMMSTIEN shirt when he is on floor
I'm in love with this song! I was an  unintentionally a pill addict. I started taken prescription medication after my 3 yr old daughter was murdered for depression, anxiety, sleep and mood stabilizer and before I knew it I was an addict ( didn't realize it at first) 10 yrs later I had a child I was told I was unable to have and I quit cold turkey. I was up to roughly 15 or so pills a day. Long story short ,I was told I should have died coming off them like I did,but I didn't want my new baby born with them in her system.. it's was a blessing  my unborn baby and myself didn't die.  I was also a single mother of 5 at the time.I'm 15 yrs clean and I thank God everyday for pulling me through this.   Thank you for an amazing song.❤
Doesn’t get realer than this. Lost to many best/close friends to drugs so since then Ive cleaned my act and pray I loose no1 else
Bro all I got to say is WTF this shit hit me so hard this is exactly what I want to fucking talk to my brother about I pray every day he gets clean I don't want that fucking phone call
LLDAFAM ❤
Sweet if  that's in the USA what if you're not living in the USA and you live in England? You should try put up help links for other countries too
joyner lucas moves my spirit & touches my soul everytime he drops a song i swear no matter the vibe of the song it’s always 🔥🩵
R.I.P Mac Miller
Jelly shouldve had a a few bars on this. Still great, but missing all the potential from jelly free-styling
I’m tip toeing on that fine line , I have 2 pills I was planning on taking . But instead  I stumbled upon this , now here with streams flowing from my eyes. Thanks for this, let me be strong 💪🏼
God bless them 😢😢😢Glad they made a song to shine light on this battle the world is facing
Joyners first and second verses are me to myself looking in a mirror when I was trying to get sober. It hit hard. I knew the song was gonna be good, but they knocked it out the park.
1 year and 2 months clean this song hit me right where it hurts healing for sure !

My name is Darin and I’ve let dope ruin my marriage I’ve stopped thank god but I’m not with my kids all the time anymore when I was home and I missing them more and more everyday but me not being happy was the cause of the drug use so I figured it out and fixed it
If you  never believe  in  yourself  you'll never  believe  anyone  believing  in  you  _ Joyner  lucas . This  line  hit hard
Jelly roll sounds like cee lo green
Oh my heart 🥹
Wow
Dam this one hit me hard🔥🔥🫡🫡
What a amazing song
Jelly sounds exactly the same with autotune! 😂 that says all you need to know!
I’m clean 22 yrs. I work hard for my recovery today. One day this day, JFT. I’ve done jails, institutions and thank you God for bringing me back from the dead twice! I was homeless, for years and lost everyone and everything and still thought I was good. This disease is a liar and wants me dead 💀! Not today mutha fuxker!! If you need help look up your local NA or AA hotline or meeting lists in your area. If you need immediate help call 911. Or go to your local ER in major cities most hospitals have a detox. Step One. We admitted we were powerless over our addiction and that our lives had become unmanageable. Thank you for this Jelly & Joyner. That ish had me in tears. God bless yous, and anyone struggling right now.
💯💯💪🏽💙🎯🙏🏾🙏🏾‼️
Jelly roll killed that hook !!!!
7 Years Sober Here!

Damn… Joyner the 🐐
Pendant 28ans j'ai souffert.Jai perdue les 3 amours de ma vie ,ils ont souffers aussi.Apres plusieurs incarcération et de culpabilité envers mes proches, je suis en rétablissement depuis 6ans et je suis en paix avec mes enfants.
I can't stop some meds because I can't function without them, I probably will puke and get nausea everytime
I’m not gonna share my pain but just know I understand what everyone of you went or are going through! We got this shit in the end
Why does that dude look like Jimmy Kimmel lol if you know you know why.
Joyner is legit the best artist around.
Grammy

Writing this from a friend's account, i dont have a phone as i sold it to get rid of my heroin withdrawals,  this song hits me right in the feels, i am just 21 and im a 5th generation alcoholic and heroin addict. I hope anybody that's hurting or going through a rough patch a better future and happiness forever.
Music that’s different from the hip hop universe right now stop playing with Joyner
DAMN....Joyner is always  on point❤️‍🔥💯
Music starts at second 1? Wow this is rare with music videos nowadays!
This was a work of art, you never let down. I missed the storytelling work
i like it ❤
My mother overdosed when I was 18 she did anything she could get her hands on from when I was 8 or 9 till 18 it was never easy for me but we have to deal with the hand we were dealt and Jelly roll you’ve been my therapy through it all thank you and I loved every second of this song all they way down to the instrumentals it’s beautiful I can’t thank you enough 🖤
My sister OD'd 4 weeks before Christmas of '22. We hadn't been close for over a decade, even though we lived in the same city. I still wish I could've helped her somehow. Watching this was the first time I fully cried about it.  Thank you, Joyner Lucas & Jelly Roll, for this AMAZING visual &  song!!!
Ouchh 😪
My 29 year old son gone from fentanyl almost 3 years ago. Took just 1 lousy pill which he thought was a percocet.  It's not to late for many others....❤
Thank you Joyner and jelly role..y'all hit every fkn situation I'm going through.. love you guys...
Joyner always delivers!!! The real topics that few will touch!!! This one hits deep for me as the person the opposite side of the addicted person
this song reached me. ❤. fact on fact your music is moving crowds of people. you bring people together when you say things with your chest. MEM.
Joyner is special talent maan
I'm only 15 and I grow up around drugs.My whole life so people overdose saw people lose their mind.this hits
Such a powerful song 🎵
This definitely hits the ❤
You two blew it out of the waters. So much passion in this song I see you
Lost My Aunt to Overdose, My Father, My Friend and almost myself. But I have been in recovery almost  two years! this song helps people see things through both viewpoints, jelly amazing on the hook. I made a song Stylez Major "Lost in a High" very similar vibe to this over 300k views please give it a listen.
Awesome song great collaboration Joyner Lucas
This song is so good. Amazing.  The verses, the chorus, tears me up. Thanks for this.
Was really looking forward to jelly on that second verse, still a great song either way. Can’t wait for the album 🫡
15.5 years clean. This is most definitely one of the best songs I’ve ever heard about addiction. To be able to see and understand both sides of it, as an addict and as someone who has lost many to this disease. Joyner and Jelly bodied this track. ❤️
this shit left me in tears omg
I met my wife 10 years ago. She struggle with addiction. I found out in the beginning in our relationship and decided I would stick by this woman. I was at every NA meeting with her and try my hardest to help in every way. 10 years laters/her being 10 years sober to date. We have 5 boys and a home. I’m so proud of here. This song hits home 😢❤
Super powerful song. It did a lot of bad shit as a very young man. It took taking away my freedom to wake me up. John knows I’m not perfect. I still have my mess ups in life but I’ve learned that without your freedom from whatever it is you choose to do life sucks. Get clean,stay clean and life is beautiful. I said life is beautiful I didn’t say it was easy.
One day😁😁I will feature this guy on a track I am inspired by this
Hit my knees at the first vocal note. As someone in love with a former addict I felt this so deeply. Heart renching and so deep. Amazing job.
🔥   Rest in peace little brother your words kept my head up
This shit hits so different when you lose someone to addiction man. My uncle passed in July from it after trying to get clean, he made it 77 days and relapsed. Unfortunately the shit he used was laced with fentanyl. To celebrate him making it to 70 days clean him and I went to the beach, little did I know exactly a week later we’d get the call saying he was found in a parking lot. I’m so grateful for that beach day man
Joyner,what a talented humble man...Truly came out with this beautiful gem put you on the god mode man keep going up!
Thanks Guys ❤ respectfully Joyner Lucas & Jelly roll & Co. That's an awesome message in the lyrics. Beautiful contrast between legendary artists 🙏💫😎J.L. &🦝J.R.🤑👍💥🔥💯🤗
I felt this, I love joyners music, he always has such deep meaning to his songs ❤
Came for Joyner, keep coming back for Jelly. This was a great song and Jelly made it unforgettable. You are strong. You can do this. 4 years sober March 9th and work in addiction field as a peer. Beautiful
😢❤️‍🩹man this song is something else hit me in the chest 🙏🏻
This is powerful stuff. And all the views in just one day is actually sad. Joyner and Jelly hitting a lot of homes with this one. I hope this song helps a lot of people.
https://youtu.be/CDd7Sz3H48g?si=MiXHKcaKPEwIt8c-
Good job brothers.  Real talk , real music.  ❤
Joyner hit it on the head. Addiction is not a disease. Its a sin that people can be delivered from and learn how to deny themselve through the knowledge and power of Christ.
When he's rapping like this, he's in ELITE category!!
Eminem?
Deep lyrics ❤❤😊
I love this one
THE HARDEST THING IN THE WORLD IS LOVING SOMEONE WHO IS SELF DESTRUCTING 😢 AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING YOU CAN DO BUT WATCH😔😢
Bunny shared a reel on fb a couple days and it had this song I’ve been tryna find it like crazy!!!
Joyner, please do us a favor and make this a 1 hour loop. Thank you!
I lost both my brothers to addiction miss yall
Amazing message
I agree its a choice at first...  It's NOT an excuse later, It actually stops being a choice, honestly
I've done listened  to the song 6 times since yesterday. Thank you for bringing awareness. I lost my sister 2 years ago and it's hard every day for all of you struggling, keep pushing you will get through this.😢
Support the new talent🥰https://youtu.be/sJJEtFmq8ec?feature=shared
Wow smgh this song is Amazing!!!!
Everyone start sharing this and telling people about it nowww! Should be well over 1 million views already & trending. I'm cryin as I type this, phenomenal song
Just broke up with a drug addict she gave our child another man’s last name I did what was best for me 😢
I’ve never done a drug in my life nor a cigarette etc so I never understood why ppl do drugs if they know what they’ll do to you and if you were always told as a kid not to do them. For me it was easy. They said say no when I was in grade school and that’s what I did. Seeing ppl lose their family, homes, becoming homeless.. I thought jeez just get off the drugs! Why would you not just stop especially after losing your kids and so forth. It took me to work at several rehab facilities to finally understand it. I’ve worked with and helped so many ppl and families and it’s the greatest pleasure I’ve ever had. So to anyone that doesn’t understand try to understand before judging or bashing ppl that are struggling with an addiction. It’s way deeper than you could ever imagine. Praying for everyone and asking God to give you the strength to overcome your situation. I can’t help everyone but I’ll try my hardest to do what I can as long as I’m alive if you really want the help. ❤
9 months sober ❤
This song touched my soul😢. The message is for all the drugs addicted. You’re a genius Joyner
Writing from Angola and I don't know speak and write English like you surely, but I love this guy messenger. Thank God to have he on the top the game. God bless the one who read it.💖💖
🙏🏼
Wow I love that! It’s a great message
I can relate to this song because I had a son who overdose on fentanyl
This man deserves a Grammy
The reply verse killed it for sure
Goosebumps Joyner🔥🔥
Heart!  Much luv, Joyner!
Thank you, Jelly Roll and Joyner Lucas for making this song this song will forever have the biggest part in my heart. I love both of y’all so dang much.
Great song with even greater message!! The actor in the video is a local Worcester rapper/blue collar worker named mic divine,he’s got a song called way down we go basically about addiction and losing loved ones from drugs. Check out his YouTube page and let’s blow his page up!!!
I still like it but u could a done better Joyner. This jelly roll shit ain't hitting
ht
Song made me tear up, I luv this song ❤
2 years sober I’m 29 started at 17 from homeless to saving lives I’m grateful for where I am today if it weren’t for the people that never gave up on me , I Love you Mom and Dad , my brothers and sisters
Damn, that’s a good one 🔥
Man that just hit me hard 2 years clean come this July I'm still struggle everyday I feel this song man Joyner one of my favorite lyricist today and jelly a man you can truly respect and look up to did it on this one
I definitely needed to this
Dang this is what I'm going through right now I heard this song yesterday and I've listened to 100 times I feel like it was made for me specifically Greatest Story Teller Alive
Congrats to all that’s been in the addiction trenches and made it out! All my life my dad has battled addiction and my life and childhood suffered behind it. Family suffers right with the person. 😢 My God sister turned to drugs and her children lost her 2 years ago to her addiction. I pray for each of you fighting to get out and those maintaining sobriety. You can do this for yourself most of all and those who love you! If you have no one believing in you, and in your corner, just know that, even though I don’t know you, I believe in you! #fighton ❤
Dean's play it again
2 words..... F...n Amazing!!!! I have never commented on a song before and consider myself a music junkie of all genres.   But man..... I literally cried tears as a grown a** man the 1st time I clicked on this song. I hit that like and repeat fast!   Addiction and Mental health are in a lot of ways similar and also go hand in hand. I have friends and family member's that struggle daily. This 1 hit home for sure!! I think every single American personally knows someone struggling with addiction. And a lot of us that don't suffer don't understand it nor know what to do about it. It's far time we educate ourselves!!  God bless you guys for spreading such a powerful message!
Joyner Lucas  being one of my favorite artist and Jelly Roll  being a long time friend this song has to be the feelings I have not been able to express since losing my mother, father and brother  To drug addiction 😭 between survivors guilt and the beautiful family I've created how could I morn. Even when writing myself it hurts because I have yet to process how addiction completely robbed me of my childhood and ripped my family away and then I hear this song and it makes since to me💯 I only tried to help my brother when he was trying his best to fight his demons but when he was in his darkest place I was nowhere to be found. I most definitely should have been there. I may have broken a generational curse but that came at a cost. To go full circle I fell in love with music as a kid and it is still my go to for everything  and through this song music has proven itself to be undefeated yet again! There are millions effected by drug addiction and I pray that we find our way to get through such a horrible genocide that is drug addiction 🙏 outstanding song fellas move the trash ass music to the side and screw the charts and awards. Go change and save somebody's life as I'm sure this song will do #realmusic #instantclassic
Been waiting on this!! Well worth the wait jelly roll great melody and Joyner with the bars!
Thank you, joyner......
I’m proud of you I suffer also my sober date is 2-1-24 just got out of rehab
This is the same way for Christians. Trying not to be a Bible thumper. How can you love someone so much and learn to let them go?
Sitting in the Fed with this on replay.  We all have that one we love we couldn't help. Appreciate you JL!
Wish this song came out years ago could of saved my brothers life, hands down best song I’ve heard brought tears to my eyes man
After 508, before ADHD Joyner is too cold.
Needed this
21 months clean and serene. This song hits home 💚
This shit hits hard
Awesome song spent many years with addiction now have 5.5 years clean
Even though, F*ck the grammars, I still hope you get one for this song Joyner. Powerful song.
This is a beautiful song bro
Great song happens all the time 💔 no one ever said I want to be a addict when I grow up f..... sucks 😢 to many to soon f.......up
March 22nd marks one year since I lost my cousin to addiction. I wish I could have shared this song with him 😢 R.I.P Stephen Garland Figueroa
In tears lost all my childhood friends to addiction I'm the last one standing and some days I feel like joining them then I see my kids and I cant imagine doing them that way 😢
I wasn’t born addicted but I feel like you was talking to me Almost 6 yrs sober at any moment Mr brown could come calling in to thee  Time answers all prayers  No longer lost, dreams started chasing me  Basic job -a felon and they promoted me  No more ptsd  OD made it out looking to God why you choose me  My blessings aren’t a lottery ticket  They coming slowly No more dark days fully charged flashlight leading the way Addiction. It’s not you it’s me that’s why I’m choosing not to stay. The man in the mirror keeps trying to talk to me  Always talking with positivity  What does he know?  A prisoner with a drug addiction  It’s his thinking that got us here.  now he wants my ear  Fears and reservation for everyone who is near lack of trust  For a life he wasted.  For all those years behind bars  Now my moms gone and I can’t go back Time heals all wounds, but it also can create new ones
I wish my baby mom could hear this she needs help Joyner she chosen meth over a 3 year old and a newborn. Seeing u with Dax in toronto
7 years clean from heavy hard drug use for over 10 years. This song is amazing . Your lyrics are perfect and jelly's vocals are unreal
Great message, but also how about the old cabin this was filmed in!
Sing that shit
How long does it take to get feelings back? Been clean for almost 6 months after snorting boy for years
joyner
This hit my soul. God bless everyone struggling with addiction. Keep fighting I'm in the ring my self🙏
Pure poetry from Joyner
This is the only song I know that describes the hell we all been through...
I dont even have an addiction but Joyner manages to tear me up again over my own shit. Thank you!
That double beat knocks hard  🎶🎵🎶🎵🎵🎶🎵🎶
This shit made me cry
My mom is relapsed a few years ago & is addicted to pain killers. They were previously a gateway drug to heroin for her. I hope it doesn’t get to that point again.  I want the best for her but I can’t let her ruin my life or marriage & career again. This song really hits home. 💔  Praying all the people who have loved ones fighting this battle with addiction and hoping they get clean. 🙏✨  Congrats to the ones reading this who have been sober 🎊💯❤️ I’m proud of you !
😮shits close
That shit home. Song is fire bro
Wow,great actors out here.  Joyner you the best.
Banger

This is powerful beyond words. I have love many addicts and each one I will always love.  To love them and watch them suffer dying slowing its gut grenching having to walk away is even hard. None of us are alone in this battle.
I felt this song in my soul. I've lost too many friends and family to addiction. I myself have 2 years clean.
I’ve been struggling with my addiction for the past 3 years . I still haven’t put the perks down …
god damn. this hit hard.
Bro Joyner you are an absolute artist.
This is the best Joyner Lucas, the joyner story teller🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🔥🔥🔥
joyner never fails to hits deep forever one of the goats
I really wish I couldn't relate to this song, but watching someone you love struggle with drugs is traumatizing, the shit you endure trying to "save" them only to realize sometimes you can't 😊
1,229 day sober (3 years, 4 days, 13 days and counting) I abs. love this video. Hits home for many; I love seeing all the recovery dates in this comment section. We are not alone. <3
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙌
damn
Repeat 💕
They do it again , song so relatable to alot of people ❤😢❤
Love this. My husband passed from overdose 😢
Truly amazing song, but what I really want to comment on here is Jelly Roll. The first song of his that I ever heard was "pop another pill" with Lil Wyte. A catchy song, ngl, but since then I had written him off as just another crunk-era drug rapper talking about syrup, lean, etc. and never really took him seriously or looked into him beyond that. Hearing his voice in this chorus totally blew me away, like "WTF HE CAN SING?!" And just now I'm looking into his catalogue and discovering so much good music I never thought I'd like. I've never been much of a "country head", but from what I've heard, Jelly Roll's music is deep, soulful, and talking about real issues a lot of us go through, which I think is what "real" country music is supposed to be, rather than your typical "guns, beer, Jesus, yee-haw 'murica" stuff. Anyway, thank you Joyner and Jelly Roll for making great music that helps us get through tough times, keep up the good work, god bless 🙏
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯
This really hit hard  As someone who has two loved ones battling addiction , I appreciate this so much
For a decade I've been the person in the first half of this song... My big brother fought the dragon. Last year this would have hit me differently. But Jesus Christ rescued him! My prayers didn't go unheard! So keep praying for them. We haven't talked in a decade till this month. He's the second half of this song. And to hear it put me in my place. I heard him not Joyner saying, "tired of you stressing me". Fam don't give up of them. Make space if you have to but never stop hoping. Never stop praying for them. Jesus hears you! I promise!!! 💞🙏🏼💞
I have 3 years clean, I met my best friend in a sober living. She has relapsed and I'm so scared for her every day :( song is on repeat
Ain't nobody touching Joyner right now. 👑
I just celebrated 2 years clean March 24th 2024. It took me from 14 years old till 41 to finally get clean through N/A and my higher power and my network thank you
Bro Thank you
Thank you Joyner
Love the song I've lost couple of family members to drugs and wish I could just hug them one more time and say I love them rest well my love one's 😢😢
Wow...
Joyner ft Dax that would be legendary 🐐🐐⏳️🍿📽🙌🔥
🙌🔥💯🎶💗🌏
First time in a while a song gave me such powerful chills followed by tears. I love you, my beautiful
Joyner. Jelly Roll. Man…
After I listen to this one I'm going to compensate for each and every track I missed
I hope this reaches someone out there today . Because I had a habit for 20 years and I been clean now for 5 years it's so much better life to live and love
I Hope Legislation to Cut Off Illegal Sources of Organs Will Be Passed Soon  Kaohsiung City Councilor Chen Lina  Councilor Chen Lina who sponsored the resolution explained the objective of the resolution to each and every councilor and gained support from all political parties. In the end, the resolution was passed.  Ms. Chen said, “The rest of the world strictly controls organ transplants. Through this joint consensus I hope Taiwan will soon complete legislation on organ transplants, enabling people to know the source of the organs, and that there is legal monitoring. We need to stop the source of illegal organs and uphold human rights.  “With legal constraints [in place], rejecting organs from unknown sources helps people avoid being accomplices to murder. This is an important safeguard for human rights and protects people’s health.”

This hit home .

Push this song
1st time listening to this. Thanks for making this. ❤
Lost my brother 2 years ago to alcohol addiction I found him dead in the toilet. Then lost my Dad to cancer. I ended up relapsing on heroin. I am 1 year clean but still on methadone.
Thank you for continually choosing to address subjects that other artists are too afraid to bring up
YOU are stronger than your addiction, find your reason WHY you MUST kick the habit. 💪
You guys should do an open verse
This song is fire! Taking both sides of the addiction argument is genius and people need to hear both sides for perspective.
Man been rocking with joyner for Years. You're so underrated. This goes in! 5 years clean this year by the grace of God
Wow. Felt this.

Man fuck this relatable bullshit lol amazing song. I just hate thinking
This song is very powerful, especially when he shows the 🌎  both sides of the coin🙌 👏 ✨️
I got addicted to heorin when I was 17, and I'm 21 this April still on the methadone but so close to coming of it all completely. This song hits so hard. My fiance was using when he was 15 when he was homeless and alone. It's so hard because people judge u so quickly, but this song hopefully will help people understand about addiction.
The only bad thing about this song is that it ends
💯💯💯💯
Jelly roll's voice melts my heart.  It has this nostalgic feel
We needed this song like 5 years ago before all our friends and peers died to the shit
Ty ❤🙌💯🙏☝️
I'm a metal head but i love your music.
This song touch me in away cause it made me think about my uncle when he was on drugs now he stop now ❤
Omg old Joyner story telling im gonna cry 😂😂😂

This song is everything, Joyner you and jelly killed this, I’ve been clean for over 8 years and have lost people I didn’t think I could breathe without. I feel both sides of this song so much. Thank you so much for this story, your ability to show both sides of a story will always make you one of the best to do it. We hear you in new Hampshire for sure

This is a banger!!
This one hits close to home, hopefully this collaboration will raise awareness that people need . Joyner always know how to delivers great idea to bring in jelly roll awesome.
bro my name is Airik Lee I've lost everything good that God blessed me with I have 4 beautiful kids and I kept turning to drugs to fulfill a part of me that I thought was going to make me happy but did nothing besides make my life worse I've had a warrant for my arrest for two years now for missing court and not showing up when I was suppose too. After hearing this on replay I'm finally owning up to everything I did wrong. I'm about to turn myself in and pray to God that my kids can see and have a sober father figure that they can look up to thank you Joyner Lucas and Jelly Roll!!
I got out of a 3 year bid in 2015-2016 for living wrong, when I got out I went to Worcester with a friend (stax)who was trying to get on at a show you were putting on ,I was fresh out looking for my next lick fully intent on continuing to live wrong. At your show I met you shortly and just meeting another man my same age from the same places I come from finding a new path in life that was totally positive, your music but also your story changed the corse of my life. Thank you
I love this song both of ya'll is inspirational to ALOT of other's

Goosebumps on me, tears in my eyes😢, you're simply fantastic ❤

Wow, such a powerful message. 2 of my favorite artist, never expected you 2 to ever be on the same song together. I can relate. I've been battling addiction for nearly a decade and I'm still fighting my demon's.  Anyways great song lol
This is masterpiece from Joyner , he never  misses 👏🔥❤💯
Thank you Joyner for the message 🎉 instant impact this one 💯
This song is a powerful reminder that sometimes the best thing for us is to focus on ourselves and our own growth. The lyrics and music video beautifully capture the essence of self-discovery and prioritizing our well-being. Remember, it’s okay to be busy working on becoming the best version of yourself. Stay focused, stay determined, and keep striving for your own happiness and success. You are worth the effort!
Damn
You are the best otherwise ❤❤ get your flowers we when you are still breathing ❤❤❤
Man of the year ❤❤❤
4 days sober and moving forward, one day at a time
This is art 🎨 thank you Joyner and jelly roll 🙌🙏👌
totally fvck with this one :(
Man your songs somehow always bring tears on my face,with hope as well ..thank you...God bless🙏🏾
I just celebrating 12 years clean after living 12 years in Kensington Philadelphia PA on heroin. 2 open heart valve transplants, stage 3 COPD, pacemaker and a shock vest, chronic congestive heart failure but I'm still here. I felt so alone and unwanted during my whole addiction.. I didn't lie, cheat or steal for drugs, I worked hard to get high. I came from a huge family, 12 aunts and uncles, 3 kids, 11 grandkids..but I am still ashamed of the time I lost with them and blame myself for all my health issues. Nobody ever said that to me but I just feel it everyday. So this song brought me to tears when I first heard it. Thank you for putting this song out. You have true emotions in-between the lyrics and that's what I feel listening to it. Jelly roll fits in the music well too. He is one of the greatest in my book and I'm now a fan of you also.stay safe, thank you for this song God Bless us ALL. 🙏💪& ✌️
word play was deep! i felt this! <33
Brah! You're the one bro! amazing as always!
Joyner killed it but would of loved jelly roll  to put a verse on this
This one hit some heart strings  ❤❤❤
God damn bro this hits home! Mad respect ❤❤
Amazing, so hard hitting 💖
WOW!!!!! THIS IS _THE_ JOYNER. WE HAVE BEEN WAITIN FOR. NOT THE CLUB BANGERS WITH NAMELY NAMES. STAY BLESSED AND SPREAD LOVE !
I don't get how people don't put him too 3 of this generation. J. Cole, Wayne, and Joyner!!
I don't get how people don't put him too 3 of this generation. J. Cole, Wayne, and Joyner!!
This one just hits differently. RIP lil bro, I love you, I hear you now. Rest easy.
It’s hard to have to admit that this is my life and that I drove my wife and 6 kids away. I lay here at night thinking about listinging to this song wishing I could go back.
PURE; When Elle parle We listen. Very Much Relatable☺❤
Joyner Never misses. High-key he’s in that room with Kendrick & Cole 🔥
Man this song hits so damn close to home with me it's crazy... Got me in tears bro.... Love you guys frfr, I'm glad I got to hear this.
I really hope whoever reads this gets through whatever it is that they are going through. ❤
Fire
I wish this song was around when she was still alive. I miss my sister everyday. Its been years but my heart still aches. Heroin took a hold of her and unfortunately she wasn't strong enough. Love you Bnizzle from your Bskizzle
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Masterpiece Joyner love how you talk about real topics and give perspective from both sides no one does it better! Jelly on the chorus is perfect that main has felt so much pain in his life due to addiction no one better   Beautiful track!
Incredible song.I love that you put Jelly Roll on it. It speaks from the heart of us lost in the cycle.
The truth
Did your thang man ....Joyner become 1 of my fav rapper story telling at its finest...... U master ur craft and kill every track
😢
Joyner, the story teller of this new world.
This song hits home, thank you for expressing the struggle lyrically in song. Song so good I was looking forward to more verses
wow
Legends
Bro this is a song to remind everyone that addiction is real and please don't dismiss it before you lose your loved ones!! I almost lost myself to addiction and my wife and son
Funny  how this came out yesterday as I make peace that I have a demon to face and stand up from where I find myself now.
Joyner man. Been a fan since 2016. This song is incredible man
First listen i 😢. Now with the music video i 😭💔. This hit home so much. My Bestfriend got addicted to drugs. Lost his family. I tried helping him out but i felt like he only calls me just to get money to buy more drugs. So i gave up on him. He is now back in the homeland, i hope he is doing better.🙁🙏🏻😭
❤ awesome song. Great duo I didn't know I needed.
Huuuuh💥💥💥💥
Relapsed....this shit hits hard. Damn....the struggle is too real right now. I'll be alright....someday. we'll be alright again soon. I promise.....
I just spent 8 months in the local correctional centre due to my addiction. Alcohol can be a killer. Im out for the last week still off it. Up in a hotel searching for my next move. Work and getting out of this city. I wont let it trap me again.
🇿🇦❤
This hits home hard 😭
Did an amazing job putting it together. It paints a beautiful picture and really brings out the real world problem with addiction and growth. Great job guys!!! Keep it up
Joyner is that dude that really raps about real fucking life and what real ppl and family's and others are going thru! 👏🙌
Anyone 🇳🇵❤
Joyner Lucas with the bars 🔥that flow switch was insane
I really like this but I think Jelly's verse recycled cuz it didn't match the song fully.
had me in tears sir... thank you for this... truly
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤❤
Joyner and jelly 🔥🔥🔥🔥
STRAIGHT 🔥🔥🔥
Wow. You nailed it my man
I truly needed this one 😪😔
Meth is fucked
😭✊️
If you get lost everyone loses 😥 RIP Q
woah..... what a song.....
I thought I hated my mom & dad until I listened to this…
Give Joyner and Jelly their flowers 💐
Two of my favorite artists ❤
Wow hits home sad 🙏
Stay strong everybody!   Joyner this song hits so hard!!
This man moves soul with his flow and lyrics... Lucas is a beast
Well then. Come straight with it! ❤ Everything, I mean Er-y-thang, is tight about this! I absolutely love this! ❤
Joyner is big inspiration for me as an artist.
This is how you break barriers.
Very powerful, from 2 of the best going.
I’ve watched this multiple times, I broke down after the first verse. Addiction took my mom from my life, she isn’t dead, but her being away for so long, I don’t know if we will ever be able to fix it.. Thank you Joyner, this was like therapy for me If anyone had lost somebody to addiction, you are not alone… I pray that God opens their mind and shows them that they can change.
I swear I thought jelly was gon rap 😢
Wow, what a song with such meaning. Hats off to Joyner and Jelly Roll. Joyner is such a talent, I hope this song blows up.
You're so insightful on this one, great take on it. 💯 🤙🏼
That one hit home for real Joyner. You’re gonna get Grammys for this. Both my parents struggled with addiction and I honestly don’t know what side I’m on.
@jellyroll @joynerlucas this is honestly what the world has needed. As a victim of someone I love being addicted I don't think anyone could've done the justice that you two have. This is by far either the best work from either of you. Congratulations on getting single of the year. (Future tense)
3 years without my mom, if only she was able to hear it before she left this earth due to suicide, we always tried to help her get out of her addiction
🙌🏾❤️❤️
I lost my best friend to drugs. And a few people after that. This song really brings me to tears. 😞🥺
BEAUTIFUL SONG - So deep!🧡
Lost my brother to an overdose 2 weeks ago. This one hurts but very well done.
Had to pause the video right before the second verse to say, I wasn't expecting this to be another song where Joyner raps from the other person's perspective, but I'm glad he did. I already liked the first verse, but I know this second verse is gonna be introspective and I really like that about Mr. Lucas. Playing both sides.
For my brother❤🙏❤ we love you and God loves you❤❤❤
Man dawg you so underrated and under appreciated sitting here getting emotional you the truth Joyner
🥵sick
This is a Masterpiece @JoynerLucasOfficial
Joyner, Jelly. You will be blessed for eternity. Thank you ❤
Yo I love your music my nigga I've been listening to you since a long came Joyner
🫡
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jelly Roll is amazing! He has such a beautiful voice, and he is an amazing beautiful talented soul. This song is even more accurate cuz jelly roll has been on both sides of this coin, he gets it. He knows and he understands. He’s such a great dude. He helped me thru the roughest lowest parts of my life, and now as I’m getting better he’s still there. his music and his words helped me thru so much, when no one else understood what I was going thru, he did. he was there when I had no one else. He’s such a sweet soul💖What a great song! And both sides have accurate points, I’ve been on both sides, and unless u have been on both sides, it’s next to impossible to understand the whole picture. Great song. Jelly roll sounds amazing💖
most underrated rapper can't wait for that album
Daaaaaaaaang🙆‍♂️🙆‍♂️🔥🎬🎶🎵
This is so good, so powerful... and Jelly sang that hook like an angel...
This song would have been one my sister would have listened to on repeat of she was still here. I miss her everyday and finding songs like this makes it feel like she's still here even if it is only for a little while.
Damn this hit so hard shit I can relate so bad damn
I've got 15 months clean and sober from hard drugs. This song had me tearing up. Hit so deep, thank you Joyner and jelly for this one.
Bro this song is magic, ❤ keep doing the goodwokr joyner
Needed this song. Fire
Joyner is definitely one of the living legends in this generation of artists.
Best song of 2024 Hands Down. Fire Joyner, and Jelly Roll Salute to Both of You! 🔥
🙏
🙏
Crazy how when he released 'Sorry' I was addicted and suicidal and now he releases this when I'm 2 years sober I just love this Joyner Lucas experience!
WOW I am so lost for words. Just had to let you know how special you are in our lives. I am a mother with my kids with addictions just 3 weeks ago my youngest son accidentally overdosed praise God he's still here each one battles with their own addictions your music is such an inspiration the day my oldest son ask me to listen to your song I fell in love with your music you have a beautiful soul praise God you are sharing your gift with the world sending love God blessed
Legendary J thank you. 🇿🇦🇿🇦
ive benn listening to this on repeat just 🔥
Let go addicts let's stand together and walk this walk love you all one day at time..
This couldn’t have came out at a better time in my life.
This here is a masterpiece!! Joyner is on another level of lyrical, songwriting and storytelling, I would even say a genius. As someone who almost died many times while in the grip of addiction, this song captures the struggle perfectly from every angle. Perfection!
Gaza need help and changes.. for the children
She's loves me in a crazy way. She's is such a lovely girl
23 years clean for me
His raping doesn't match beat. Jelly roll needs hit gym too. Weidro
who else called the number at the end? Even the voicemail makes me feel supported... it was nothing for him to set up a phone with that number and make us all feel like we can reach out.
Wow, I am going through this right now and have been for a long time... I just dont know how to stay sober. Im doing good now but it has been a very intense battle, its off and on but I have 4 months from stimulants, 2 months from opiates and 3 weeks from cannabis ... I dont want to be like this. Taking medication and in therapy too.. It hard but its harder to be addicted. Much love and respect to those still struggling and trying to do better.. I dont know how to help yall other than just fight the battle myself.
7 years clean from heroin this song means a lot thank you Joyner 🙏
This is absolutely beautiful.
This is such a powerful song. It's a collaboration I never knew we all needed to hear.
This speaks so loud! 7 years clean and this song hits hard
That is deep powerful song
Hit my heart ,just made me cry
Joyner is so amazing!!!
Wow just wow! I’ve fought/fight addiction and in recovery but have a close family member that doesn’t want help yet. Pray for us!! Fire
Man jelly roll is amazing
Love this
Joyner😢❤
This what we need ,  thank you man 💙
My man i said a comment about you that went something like i loved your evolution but i felt like i missed the old joyner.... my brother this right here took mee back to the powerful lyrics that you can speak that punch me in the fucken heart.  We love you my man!!!!
Absolute fucken banger 💪
You the man joyner
Man I'm 2 and half years clean. I'm actually in tears writing this. Jelly roll was my go to when I got to rehab 2 and half years ago. I took me losing everything house, wife and kids. One day my daughter called me as I was getting high after not talking to me for a year. That call made me realize I what I needed to do. Today I have my kids back and that's all that matters to me. I used some kind of drugs for over 20 years. Is it hard, yes? But is it worth it to get clean? Hell, yes.
Heart breaking 😢..great song
Freaking banger of a collab I never knew I needed only thing that could of made this better is if jelly spit a verse that would of been more epic
I heard this yesterday and said to myself instantly after  hearing it once, oh that’s a headphone track. I a day later headphones on hours later and not even sure how many times I’ve gone right back to the beginning… play it again.! #straightgrammy
This hits so extremely close to home lost so many of my brothers to addiction 😢 keep fighting!
His songs like this always hits.
Wow.
Jelly roll made the song worse. Joyner is always magnificent.
Yo that really hit  me different I battled addiction for 25 years and it took along time and the grace of god to kick the addiction I’ve been sober going on 15 years
Thanks bro
🎵 🎤 🎵  [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 1: Joyner Lucas] Yeah, I got somebody I love (Yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (Damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (Yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (Woah) But I wrotе this song in hopes when they hеar it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it as much  (Woah) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (Damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and makin' you feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (Do what you might, woah) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you And I gotta tell you truth (Tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (Lose it) And you in denial about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me  [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 2: Joyner Lucas] Look, I know you been callin' for me (Yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long, I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (Uh) How do I look go of something I know is something is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (Nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, wonderin’ when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem is me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, I'm tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me  [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?
The most powerful song I've ever heard. As a daughter of an addict this hit me so hard
Reminds me of hopsin Chris dolmeth lol same premise
jelly roll didnt only get fat je also gettin soft AF
They won’t play this on the radio but they will play migos and Drake over and over
Ouch
Masterful, well done.
Hits way too close to home 😢
Yall are straight killing it with this one... Hit the soul... 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Addiction IS a disease. The only reason addicts justify their drug of choice is because they lost the ability to feel normal without it. Nobody in their right mind would choose a drug over a loved one. The nucleus accumbens is literally reprogrammed to place priority on the drug over everything else. This reprogramming is not a choice. It’s a physical and permanent change unless something drastic is done to reprogram it. Lastly ask any addict and they will all tell you they wouldn’t wish addiction on their worst enemy 🤷🏽‍♂️
This is so good and so true!! This really touched my heart!! 6 years clean off heroin.. we do recover! Don’t give up hope!
Two of my favorite artists out but I can’t lie, was kinda hoping for a verse from Jelly. Still fire though. 🔥🔥🔥
I’ve buried over 50 people in the last 3 years from addiction both my wife an I got almost a decade sober, this song made me break down. This cut deep and can’t even explain how it’s so true
Just sent this to my partner 🖤 I hope he truly hears the words 😔
This song should be at 5 million views people are sleeping on this song
I needed this thank you
🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
Fucking powerful man... god damn...
My brother is almost a year sober, he was my best friend and then wasn’t. I’m so glad he’s sober and I hope he knows how proud I am of him
Addiction is real.   Great song. Dual perspectives again.  I just realized through this song all those prayers I prayed were for those who I affected and for me personally to get through it.  For my brothers and sisters still going through it, my prayers are for now you. Don’t give up. You can do it. It’s so damn hard. But minute by minute turns into hour by hour. Days turn into weeks. Weeks turn into months. And months turn into years. Stay strong 💪 much love to you all
So powerful❤
This was tougher than I thought it'd be..🙌
This song hits an addict that is aware of their disease LIKE NO OTHER
❤ GREAT COLLAB AND GREAT SONG!
That hit to close to home
My mother and sister battled a meth addiction, heroin took my uncle, coke is taking my grandpa, shrooms and acid keeps my dads heart, broken into pieces I’m trying to succeed while taking care of my family I don’t do drugs at all but I’ve got scars from loved ones who do. It seems the drugs got my whole family tree.
🔥🔥
As someone who struggles with addiction this song hits deep in my soul absolute 🔥 both these great artists put all their emotion into this side note hit a line of ❄️ while listening to this for the first time it hit so deep I swore to god I’d never touch it again time to begin the most important journey in my life thank you both for imo the greatest song of 2024
I love this song so much
This is why @JoynerLucasOfficial will always be mine and my son’s favorite artist. He is truly unmatched 🙌🏼
Omg this song is the song of the year
Great song true felt rap from the ❤
🔥
This song is truly incredible. It's hits so close to my heart. Lost my son to drugs and my heart is forever shattered. He was 19 and had his whole life ahead of him.  I also am deeply in love with someone who has an addiction problem. Over the past 8.5 years he comes in and out of my life.  Currently out of my life.  I've tried to help him. It hurts to watch him destroy himself. I worry that he will end up leaving this earth.
I love this song it took cps to come in and take my kids to make me realize what I lost 10 months clean now and I have my kids now a new life of being sober never will I take life for granted addiction is real shit for the ones who still in their addiction stop we need you we love you your worth love and life find help
Music about real life subjects. This what music supposed to be. Don’t know one wanna hear no music about waking up in a Bugatti when they’re waking up in Malibu. Music about real subject matter. Meanwhile Jelly Roll shot straight to the top. Bubba stayed down till he came up.
Deep song much love always to u joyner & jelly dis is what we need more of 🔥
❤❤❤❤❤
Auto tune should get a feature credit
Mannnn Joyner you really just told my situation with my sons mom and me. I can't be with her anymore but I hope she gets help
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 brought tears to my eyes 💯
Appreciate this
I was addicted to drugs and alcohol from the age of 14, finally got fully clean at age 31 and now have three and half years clean and sober, have a family and career now!
In the rehab and it is a disease but at the same time it's treatable I'm from Indiana but all the way in Utah in a treatment center 22 hours away from home. Miss my home my family but in due time when I get out of here my family gone be happy

I really needed this song and I didn't know it. My mom struggled with drug addictions, she wanted to get better but she always went right back to them, my dad gave her a choice him and our family or drugs, she chose drugs,  she was arrested eventually and died of Cardiac Dissection (google it) in prison before that I hadn't seen her for years, RIP 🙏♥♥
Legendary
Hiphop is still alive
You never realize how much you effect the ones around you while drinking and drugging until you get sober,387 days clean and sober,ill never put my wife and kids through that again,God is great,odaat
Didnt want to cry tonight but here i am...
Joyner  it's not  even a debate you are the best to tell a story & paint the picture very clear ..  been here since 2014 I was just a kid then, 26 years old now
True words i lost close loved one he wasn’t addicted but drugs took him away 😢 i miss u bro so much i know your in better place now
No one better that jelly roll to be on this type of song
Clean and sober. Missing my sister who is using. 💙
jelly roll sounds like a muppet singing
THIS SONG MADE ME CRY ITS FROM THE HEART! ABOUT 3 YEARS FOR ME NOW BUT WHO IS COUNTING. PRAYER AND MORE PRAYER. THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING ALL THE BROKEN PEOPLE WITH YOUR WORDS OF INSPIRATION. GOD BLESS YALL!
Peep his words  I ain’t gonna say they name cuz I don’t want what
Man this was good but WHY the audio tune. Jelly woulda sounded so much better without it
I wish to God I could better empathize with addicts
Exactly 💯
Came from Shaq. Great song. Great message. Bless!
Joyner I what we want to see more  of.
beautiful 👌🏻
If I could be honest I'm at the lowest in my life this made me cry . Made me relate life is hard I could only just pray it gets better I'm starting to lose hope but you music gets me back in focus
Repeat all day 🔥🔥🔥
I fight alcoholism everyday! And this song was special to me, it's like a conversation between my sober side and my drinking side. Thank you Joyner!
This is Fire ! 🔥 two hard artists that deserve a hundred fold for their contributions to music!
you one of the best storytellers in the game💯💯💯❤️
Had 3 years clean wife lost a child early stages and yeah hello darkness my old friend cuz just sent me this literally sitting here crying
Bro the first line gave me goosebumps 🩻🥹💆🏿‍♂️
Amazing!  Great message of awareness.  I lost my one and only nephew when he was only 26 years old from an overdose.  In and out of rehab for seversl years.  He just couldn't shake his demons. 😢🙏
That shit was ice Cold 🥶

This is the conversation I have with my sister...I am 15 yrs clean and I know the struggle
Holy!!! 🔥
Mama please stay
Tomorrow will be 5 years since you’ve passed pops it dont ever get easy
Wooooow❤
Real art. Makes other rappers look like ferral animals.
Bigger than music. Great job guys
Joyner, I’ll forever wonder how you can see through someone else’s pov, as if you lived it your damn self. Did you get urself addicted to write this song!?! Almost believable
@jellyroll this one ………. 😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ love this one baby!!!!!
Amazing, we need more of this brother! This is what you were meant to do, change lives!
Thank you for making this song my Allah bless everything you do.
Whoever that actor is absolutely killed it as the drug addict props to him I hope he finds more success through this video he showed a lot of range in his performance
Amazing, Prayers to all the ones who are addicted to substances.  🙏🏽
I’m one of the lucky 🍀 ones. I’m still here by Gods Grace, & the help of a bunch of different ppl including my work that paid for my rehab. I got clean on July 11th 2014. Got 10 yrs coming up. Thank you for this song Joyner. No other rapper alive can tell a story like you do, & it’s been that way for a long time now! U just take every damn song to unseen heights. Amazing. God bless anyone out there struggling with addiction. I pray you get help while u still can. God bless ✝️❤️🇺🇸🙏🏼
Another amazing song touching on addiction.
Powerful message
THIS IS THE JOYNER WE KNOW AND LOVE
Buried a lot of friends, including my father. This hits deep. Thoughts and prayers to everyone to everyone going through it. One day at a time.❤
❤❤❤❤
SEE ......jelly is not meant to do country sounds like his older therapeutic albums this is the type of music he came from and should stick too
🌟✊️❤️
❤
There's always two sides to a story if only we all thought this way 🔥🔥🔥
🔥 🔥 nice jam
This went hard
Yoooooo.. the fuq brodie?????
Racism, Suicide, and Drug Abuse. These are things that need to be talked about and Joyner's given the perspective from both sides on all of them. When he makes music, his words are always powerful.
❤❤❤
man this has me cryin ngl
Needs a remix with a jelly roll verse
Beautiful. Well done.
10 years clean next October. There is light at the end of the tunnel for anyone still battling this demon. There is life after addiction. One step at a time

Wow. Wow Wow. I never thought ministry could come from a rap song like this. Many people say it's not the message but the delivery. This song shatters do many cliques. The delivery IS THE MESSAGE🤍🙏🖤  BE BLESSED!
Joyner Lucas X Jon Connor would be stupid dope
Damn😭😭😭💔
This, is the Joyner I became obsessed with.
This one hits home
Damn. What a song. Eminem would kill this beat too 🔥
Joyner my man this shit is 🔥 great concept so many people r gonna b able to relate to this either on the friemds perspective or the addicts or both 👏👏👏 this is the type of music we need u def r one of the most slept on artists out there i was gon say rapper but u r truely an artist not just a rapper amd jelly my muther fuckin man ive known bout u since ur early days and seeing ur evolution has been inspirational but u my man can sing ur ass off as well as rap and u fuckin killed that hook this better go number one both of u deserve it and better than 99% the crap in mainstream fucking our younger generations minds up only thing i would say is kinda wanted to get a verse from jelly roll rapping too cuz know he can relate to the concept and subject matter of the song but probly wouldnt of really fit with it with the two perspective concept from joyner much love and respect from me to both u outstanding artists 👏👏👏

Damn, i hate hard drugs so much. So pointless.
Thank y'all so much for this ❤
Had an x gf I lost to my addiction. She tried everything to get me 2 stop .. I just could not .. didnt want to .. She left me .. I lost my parents and tried to commit suicide .. she stayed by my bedside day in and day out as I was in that bed with tubes running in and out of me. I finally got 2 go home and my addiction ran ramped from all the pills they gave me. I lost her for good and have not spoke 2 her in 20 years. Every relationship I try and fill those holes I caused between me and her .. I still think about her 2 this day after being 10+ years sober .. If I could tell her anything it would be Baby girl im sorry and Im okay now but I know you had 2 walk away and its okay.
😭😭 You are worthy. You mean something. You are loved. Thanks Joyner for another banger. 🔥
😢 that's amazing brother. That's what art needs now.
This is incredible❤
I have been clean since May 31st 2022. Thank god. If your struggling just kno there is a brighter side to life nd I hope you find it. Don't ever think you can't because I did, ik you can.   Ps rip that rear view mirror off nd only focus on what's ahead of you! Keep going
This goes hard! This one better win awards
I love you joyner all the way from  the Republic of South Africa
“I promise I love you but I gotta do what’s best for me” hits different. my mum is an addict. Lived with her for a few years whilst it was happening and she just became a whole different person. it got to the point I couldn’t help her and had to move out. That was nearly 2 years ago. I hope she sees this at some point and gets the help she needs
I love this song and video. Jelly's singing seems a little too high pitched on this song.
As a man who have brother with drugs and alcohol addiction, this song hit me even harder when I remember back days. He ruined our family, my mom sick and passed, I hate him so much. But, still, at the end of the day, he is my brother.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉
If you have a loved one that's trapped in addiction it's hard to not let them take you down into their hell with them. There's nothing you wouldn't do to see them clean. The hardest lesson I ever learned in life was to learn how to let the mother of my children go. Shit still hurts.
This is 🔥
Dammit man this hit me so hard....😢 I pray for anyone fighting this demon. R.i.p to everyone we've lost. Way too many...
This hits home. My kids mother got hooked on heroin and it fucked our family up
❤❤❤❤❤
Damn this song hit me hard! I was addicted to meth for 18 years and have been clean for 5 years but this brought me to my knees! What an AWESOME song! Much love from Henderson Ga USA
“If you don’t believe in yourself, you’ll never believe in somebody believing in you”- damn, Joyner.
Jelly roll your voice is awesome in this song !!!! Would love to hear more of this sound of yours voice . I’m in Mount Washington Ky where your drummer is from
Good
This is amazing
Wow
Dawg this…… 😢😢
Caseoh preaching 😩🙏
This is dope!!
Jelly with that smooth butter velvet chorus 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I pray my kids get off the drugs
Man i really need this been going through a ruff road and man this is what i needed
Hip hops top ten and i said it. Simply for the fact that God work in many ways and surely this song has saved some lives.
Bro, this shit is too real 🔥
Amazing song 🙌 I'm a little over 8 years clean from drugs, thankfully. I've lost so many people I love to addiction, including the love of my life. It's a horrible thing, and it's at its worst right now for millions of people. If you're still struggling with addiction, I hope you make it through. You may feel alone right now, but once you put it down, you'll see that you aren't. There's people who love you. Don't let them lose you.
Thank you Joyner Lucas and jelly roll for helping others and for caring so much. Y'all are the change we need in the world. My mother-in-law is addicted to drugs and I pray every day she'll change. We haven't seen in her in about two or three years.
This is a banger 🔥
2024 the year of substance music!
Storytelling at its finest and millions go through this everyday, featuring jelly roll classss!!!!!!
The vocals at the start are amazing and awe-inspiring
Thank you so much. 7 years sober here. 🥺😢🙏🙏 Addiction Most definitely is a BRUTAL disease. Never in a million years did  I think I would end up an addict. - growing up an only child I had so many hopes and dreams. I wanted to be a veterinarian. I was amazing artist, and as I grew into a beautiful young adult, I did lots of modeling and make up art and gorgeous photography… It wasn’t until I suffered a bad injury that I was prescribed pain medication and it’s like a switch went off inside of me, a new addiction right in my family and most of my life. My dad was an alcoholic. Self-medicating his own pain and insecurities. I almost knew better than to ever take the first pill even though it was my prescription. But I took it and the rest is history. Years and years in years I battled addiction to opiate pain medication‘s in in 2016 I nearly took my own life due to addiction and depression.  I am grateful to still be here and I want to be able to go on to make a difference and help others who are suffering in silence. Thank you so much. You are awesome. Sending much love. What an amazing combo you and jelly roll. Two outstanding talents.!!!!🥹🙏🙌💙💖💕👏👏👏👏👏 sending much love, sincerely Robyn from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (Phillyyy)
If only Mac could hear this..
Hits So Close To Home! ❤ 🎶🙏
Wow. Goosebumps

This shit hits to close to me rn tbh I am the one talking to myself like this half the time
Thank you for this song, you'll never understand how much it songs like this help
Keep em coming Joyner please 🙌🏽
Please pray for me 😢 Im going through a terrible fight to a sense that Im slowly losing myself.
This is what I needed!!! Damn I love you both Joyner and jelly roll
Fantastic work fellas!
I absolutely love this song! I've listened to it non stop since it dropped because I'm a recovering addict and I relate to all of jellyrolls song but this one that he sang with Joyner Lucas hits on a different level! Amazing! Absolutely love it!
thinking about this, more on a talk between you and your self conscious, rather than you and a loved one....... hits different. feel both sides..
Real shit here hits home fr fr
Ppl who like this 👍🏼
hit home...awesome sauce
Goosebumps
Wow just wow
Just had to tag along with some people in comments…. My uncle came out of prison from Boston and came after 20+ years and then gets cancer once he got out. Im 23 now and back when I was 19 he flooded our house when we had gone out for a bit… it was due to an overdose and the pill cap flipped upside down in the sink while it was running. This song really got to me ngl… and I dig it 💪🏻💯
This is a deep song my boy. Real shit. MASS STRONG 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Ive got 5 years and counting sober. Finally. I'm free. I'm finding happiness within myself. Learning to love myself. We can recover. I rebuilt bridges that I'd burned. I've mended ties with my family. And that. Is what it's about. My heart goes out to anyone out there suffering. Just know that you can recover.
Jelly roll and gremlin should do a song, he's mom over came sooo much.
Man! This one hits home a lot. I am currently in September clean of meth for 6 yrs and going and worked so very hard to stay sober and make a life for me and my fiancé to where we have stayed caught up on everything and have owned and paid off 4 cars and doing decent for me not working in ten years and I have been at my current job later in December will be 6 years also !!! So many things have kept me alive, sober, and dependent on really no one but myself! Feels great LOVE THE SONG!!!
Brought me to tears..these two getting together is something special.
I’m 7 months sober off of hard drugs. There is hope but always remember we only live once and life is too short so be happy for what u have.
Wow.
As the mom of an addict, this has me in big tears! It's like you've read my journals and my mind and wrote this 😢❤
My Son is finally 1.6 months sober, this hits my heart❤💔❤️I had to let him go to get him to were he is now❤
That was awesome
Best song of 2024🔥🔥
Hits the soul been thru it all this really hits my heart g❤
🔥🔥🔥
Jelly killed the chorus. Sounds great!
This is deep. I lost my husband. He was lost and addicted. He took his life and I’ll never ever be the same. I wish things could’ve been different 😭
Fucking tune !! ❤🙏🏻🙂👍🏻
Joyner is by far one of the best lyrical geniuses and storytellers in the world. Thoughts  and  pictures are deep af and he has never let me down. Ever! God blessed him for real!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🥂
Jelly roll for president he's truly bringing America together
Damn so many humans in this comment section celebrating their recovery success. And there’s no way I can reply to every one of you on a congrats and keep at it 1 day at a time but fr yall keep it up and keep passing your story onto others as encouragement. I’m coming on 8 years totally clean of all (alcoholic here) this august on the 15th.
I’ve never been addicted to drugs. i’ve never really even tried anything stronger than weed.. But i happened to fall in love with someone who is an addict.. i’ve let go of him a few years ago.. he’s still an addict, and i pray for him everyday… i miss him… i miss the good old days we used to have together…. but all i can do keep trying to be strong for myself.. and pray he gets stronger.. i know it’s selfish to feel sorry for myself but man… watching the one person you love give up on everything they’ve worked so hard for eats you up so much…
Shii is so powerful, if you know how to listen 🙏🙏
Mane I did not expect these two to collab. That’s how you know both of them came from the gutters.💪🏼❤️🔥 mad respect
wow this one hit hard.  In 11 days, I will be 2 years sober. I had to cut a lot of close friends from my life for this to be possible. Sometimes people just don't understand. I truly wish some of them would have followed along. For once in my life, I chose myself.
Wooooow 🎯
This is so powerful! Thank you for putting THIS out here!
😭😭😭 I needed another verse
Mannnn I RIP to my uncle this video and song hit my soul 😔💔
Damn this song speaks
Tip top my man on point touchs home that shit does
My God I felt this to my core. My whole entire soul felt it. Lawd, you can feel the pain and emotions in their voices. This is real and raw. I love it!
🎉ive been hoping he would go back to true joyner frozen came out when my ex dwi dissabled my first born 2 months in jail a free if i did would been 30 plus she plays keep away with kids through her disability that song helped on very dark daysthank u
Whoever that man is that was playing the part of the addict yow hats off the man was putting hes soul into it👊🏾 ik is joyner doing both sides but that guy felt it
Is the number at end to contact is that Joyners personal number? The name of the album makes sense now..
real talk...
Joyner just went next level
Joyner Lucas is the Tyler Perry for music
Joyner, you always tell it like it's the real story and your art has set you apart in my eyes and ears, and I really appreciate this one. Thanks brother
I been waiting for this to come out!!! ❤❤
Brings tears to my eyes. That's a vibe
If it wasn't for my 2 sons and wife I'd be some where with a bottle and a straw to my nose vacuuming up a line of cocaine trying to erase what I went through because of someone who mentally destroyed me and now I'm going on 9years sober and love life and thanks to the most 3 important people in my life and music like this help me fight the urge thank you for helping me realize I wasn't erasing anything I was killing myself slowly and didn't care
I am BAWLING in my living room . I’m trying to explain why Momma is crying to my daughters, but Momma lost her Momma 4-11-16 to overdose of narcotics. This is beautiful . I can’t form any other words right now I’m just gonna listen on repeat a while and let this out 😮‍💨😮‍💨
Almost 3 years sober after losing everyone including my kids. Growing stronger and stronger everyday! And fighting for my babies back so they can meet their new sister!!! I just hope one day god can touch my biological fathers shoulder with the same way he touched mine! Thank you Joyner thank you jelly so much for this song!! You 2 have been on my playlist for years!!!
Joyner Lucas I absolutely am in love with this calab with Jelly Roll u 2 r 2 of my fav rappers old & new so this made my yr thx u 4 it ur songs have a way of reaching out & making u really think bout ur life, thoughts,& or loved 1s that no1 else can do its the presentation of 2 people having a convoy that resonates with me so deeply keep up the amazing work much ❤️& respect,Jenna.S
Beautiful work. Never expected a Jelly feature! Shout-out to your actors you hire. They always on point too
I got chills. RIP Jay
This really got to my feels bc I lost my dad to drugs 4 years ago and it tore me in peices and had to listen to people tell me how horrible my father was and what a monster he was at such a young age of 7. It really got to me because I turned 13 this year and I just wanted him to be here. I’ve had thoughts of 🔪 since he died, to be with him. But I have to js push through it but this song is js so amazing
Wtf no jelly verse
Damn this hit, especially home 🫶🏻❤️🫶🏻
Man this song got me pumped for the new album, joyner jus dropped another masterpiece
Here commenting as mom to 3 that lost their dad to addiction and it's the worst shit ever.....😢❤❤ wish people understood that they don't just hurt themselves....
👏👏👏
This is next level!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song shook me to my fucking bones.
Joyner your talent is a gift of God. Every song you put out hits me in the feels.
Fire... much love from cincinnati
@JoynerLucasOfficial that white guy in the wife beater was challenging you for sure 😉
This hits home. I lost a really good friend to bad drugs. He shot horin for the second time in his life and he died within a few minutes. His haroin was laced with fent and killed him. I always will love this man he was so real and down to earth.
I hope whoever reads this is blessed and highly favored and know that you matter and you can beat your addiction.. it’s up to you! You got this !!!
Jelly/Joyner I did go through addiction and these songs were needed back In the day for me but now it just solidifies my choice to get clean for myself so I can take of my family.
This one hit home 😢 I lost my brother to addiction
This was so real. Man this made me cry.
LORD....THIS SONG 😭🤲🏾🤞🏾🙌🏾
Damn bro, i hope you get your roses brother. This is what you to, your ability to tell a story and get your word and feelings across through music… Top tier!!
Dope!🙌
This shit hits home man with being a recovering addict myself shit hits different
This song hit😢 my sons father passed away in 2022 from a drug overdose 😢
I'm LOST! I lost lil brother! In 2021. Omg. I have soooo much to talk about. I'm in a shell
This goes so harddddddddd 👀🔥
Love this song. Tryn to get clean is like a never ending war..
JL & Jelly damn what a mashup!! Joyner doing what Joyner does best ... Shinning a light on hard topics & making people think about things from a different point of view!
I need you ellen.t ❤ I just needed you to stay strong for me to smartin up.😢 and I would of . miss u.
I can dig it, but not what was done to jelly voice. This ain't a for Jelly through Joyner, this a Joyner through Jelly. Your a fry next to a potato. I enjoy the song, but the over use of mainstream crap on his style and voice, it worries me. After 20 years of listening, I know his natural voice woulda sent the message deeper.
😢😢
I wish my brother could hear this Addiction took his life God it still hurts this is remarkable thank you Joyner pray you that’s fighting the battle Keep fighting Jesus loves you
@JoynerLucasOfficial this song touched me 💯
Awoooo🔥🔥 good music🙏
Been a long time since a song has made me really cry 🩷 beautiful
Bro I needed to hear this my wife cheated on me with someone from her past and in my own house I’m ready to give to throw it in …
This is Song of 2024 ##wedorecover
Literally crying...this song hits the soul..  I have been hoping my two favorite people would make some music together.. y'all are both my idols. I'm 6 yrs clean from heroin
I love this how it portrays someone who loves a addicts pov and then the pov of a addict I have struggled with addiction for a long time 2 relapses been clean for 2 years and this one made me ball my eyes out you portraitred both sides so well your so talented
I’m speechless 😶
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This really HIT home thinking about my brother! I'm so glad he's clean!
Friggin' awesome song...was getting really hype for Jelly Roll's verse...bummed we didn't get to hear him spit a few bars from his point of view.
This hits home
I am crying! My lil brother died in 2021. SO much behind it. Owensboro police wanted him gone. Omg! There is SO damn much I can tell. Bottom line. My sister died june 2016. Dad 2016  brother 2021. Mom, barely hanging on. I'm being destroyed with mental shit! Help!!!!!!
It's like the 20th time I'm listening to it this afternoon. I'm a 24yo dude and no one cares about my problems, it's like people only like the version of you they project on you and when things aren't ok they don't care/shit on you. I always love listening to these different perspective Joyner songs where the character completely opens up and lets everything out. Fills in that void like Jelly said. who cares about stupid grammys, you're the only one that talks about all these societal issues so well.
Mom I hope you see this I just want you to get better I just miss my fucking mom 🥹😞😭 Ill always love you I just won’t understand you I guess
WOOOO ❤
This goes CRAAAAZY
I just got out of jail. 22 days sober today and counting.... I needed this. Rest easy Whisper lamont,christopher gorrie,John adams ,Julie Mayes I miss yall so much!
❤
Damn Joyner another one hitting people rite in the hearts. Great track great video.
That tells all sides of the story. Thank you gentlemen,  incredible, and may it help many.
This is not from this era. What a rhythm it has. Spanish speaker saying so.
This song was released yesterday  Coincidentally my friend unfortunately passed from addiction yesterday afternoon as well Tomorrow, his birthday I’ll be making a video for him to this Thank you for giving us a voice
This man is a genius!! Protect Joyner at all times!! A true lyricist! A product of our greats that came before him!!!! My favorite rapper period!!!
Wow! Relatable. Great song
JA💛 2k2🤘🤘 🇳🇬
W…❤…Jelly and Joyner…W
This song hits a cord. As someone who has struggled and now in recovery 8 years it’s so relatable on so many levels. I’ve been the one who had to be let go of but I have also learned to love someone and let them go.
ALL LOVE FROM ANTIOCH ❤❤❤❤❤
My first time hearing this. Brought tears but also enlightenment to my eyes. Your words will truly save lives Joyner 💯 Thank you
I like this
Joyner is a genius man deff one the best artist within the past 6 years the way he crafts is insane and it sucks he doesn’t get the respect he deserves I love jelly roll I don’t fuck with country music but gotta love and respect jelly
Lost my best friend corey to a drug overdose. The things i wish i could show him an share with him today..
Shoutout to Everyone fighting addiction and Winning.I know its a daily struggle but yall doing it..Drugs are glorified now and its a shame because it ruins lives and families..This was needed and appreciated..
it annoys me so bad when i hear the "addiction is a choice not a disease" idiots saying stupid shit. addiction isnt called a disease so addicts can push teh blame on someone or something else. part of recovery is admitting youire an addict and admitting youre powerless over it. you dont get clean by making excuses. the ONLY people who think theres some excuse to use because its called a disease are the people who are NOT addicts and NOT understanding why its labeled that..  diseases are diseases when they meet the following criteria. diseases are Progressive (gets worse over time). chronic (long lasting and difficult to eradicate). and fatal (if left unchecked it will kill you)... diseases are progressive, chronic, and fatal... addiction is progressive, chronic, and fatal...   addiction being a disease isnt to be used as an excuse to keep using, its so doctors and psychologists and psychiatrists and scientists can better understand exactly what is happening scientifically so more ways to achieve recovery are invented. cousin johny shooting up dope in a bando on clinton ave while going to outpatient to get soboxone to sell it for dope every month, thats not who you should be listening to. if HE uses addiction being a disease as a reason to keep using then thats on him. but there are millions and millions and millions of recovered addicts all around the world who did get clean and stayed clean. like myself with coming up on 7 years clean from IV heroin, crack, fentynal, coke. ive slept under bridges in the winter. ive lived in bandos with no power in the winter. ive sold everything i own for drugs. Ive stolen from family to get high and get off sick. i WAS that piece fo shit garbage human being. i WAS cousin johny at the outpatient clinic pretending to be clean so i could sell my scrip every month. felony drug court saved my life and ive been clean ever since. not all addicts are those fuck ups who refuse to get it right. some of us wanted it enough to make it happen. we do recover. and the progression of the research around addiction is how people will get clean in the future. advancements in medication and programs and research and all the shit that happens above my pay grade to bring new methods of getting clean to market. like  naloxone implants which didnt exist even 10 years ago.   so yeah, people have used addiction being a disease as an excuse, for sure. but thats not the norm and nobody in recovery agrees with them. if youre an addict the ONLY correct move is to get clean by any means necessary. making excuses and continuing to use isnt how you get clean. addiction is a disease that started from a choice. same as any other disease that started from a choice. if i choose to fuck a hooker and catch aids that doesnt make the aids any less of a disease because i chose to fuck a hooker. people need to focus on the right things. and if you dont know what youre talking about then dont feel entitled to an opinion because there are real lives hanging in the mix.
This hit my soul hard
Breathtakingly beautiful🖤
props to the dude in the white tank top. Great acting skills
Back to your awesome style of music. I love when you tell stories, that's what brought me to ur music. Lately it fell off but glad to see back to your roots.
My ex of 8 yrs was trying to stay clean but failed a few times when we were together. I finally had to let him go.
Doesn't lucas dislike white people?
Damn Joyner, you story telling skills are top tier. Thankyou for the lyrics and the journey you send me on with every song 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Joyner lucas this is the real u I have missed this type of inspiration broooooooooooo
So powerful…
I love it I needed to hear this
this hits home , i am not on drugs but suffering from depression and anxiety it can take over your whole life a d mental , i know it isn't as big as an addiction but it is so hard somedays physically and mentally and i feel.i am not who i used to be .
Yooooo, you can't stop in CT after that Brooklyn show in May. I mean, you really are going to skip over me, my boy!  Plus, we right there!Lmao 😂
I’m ngl. . . Joyner never misses with me. Dude is tragic with his music. I love it!
Just waiting for Friday mehn
I don’t believe in that disease crap either! Sorry was hooked for 10 years and I made my choices only me!! Got over 12 years clean and I’ll never go back but that’s from my choices no one else’s or a doctors prognosis
And this is how you change the world... love this
6months sober anything’s possible ❤
You never fail to put out bangers that make you think deep
This song hit me like a ton of bricks it is so true the 2nd half is so spot on that's the problem in this world is no one cares to see that there is a good human behind the addiction 🙏 10 years clean and still hit me hard
Beautiful and well written. I LOVE IT!!!
Amazing collaboration!! Both are great artists.
Brooooo, if these 2 went in HARD on a track - it’d be 🔥🔥
i was in a deep depression, found a woman that made the pain bearable. she introduced me to heroin. i spent the next 3 years of my life living expecting to die. On 12/1/2014, I used hand tools to cut a hole in a pharmacy’s roof to break in and steal every narcotic they had on premise. i knew the odds and planned a path for each one. if we got away with it, i’d have enough to not be dope sick for the next 3 months at least, my other plan was if we got caught, i’d eat enough pills to never have to experience this planet again. we got caught, but i never planned or intended for me to be here and able to type this comment. it’s been a quite the journey. ❤
😊love it Joyner Lucas..
"If you don't believe in yourself then you'll never believe in somebody believing in you" 🙌🔥🔥🔥
Gotta a brother rn he just left for rehab today. This song is literally our relationship. Im so tired trying. Its hard cuz all i ever wanted was for him to succeed and do well. Growing up he was someone i always looked up to. But its different now. I try to be there for him and give him chances and opportunities but its only led to being hurt. I know for him there's a lot in this song which he can relate to. We both have lot of trauma from childhood and our teenage years. Now as adults we've taken different paths on treating it. But one thing we can agree is that we both gotta do what's best. Praying he succeeds and doesnt need anyone. Praying he sees that he himself is worth fighting for.  Jovan, I love you bro and am hoping you can write your comment on this song sometime in the future sharing your success and become an inspiration tp others.
I celebrate 9 years sober this year, this is such an amazing and powerful song.. I got chills throughout the whole thing. Thank you for this! ❤
Shit hits home ❤
Lord save my son please 😢🇦🇺
You the GOAT Joyner, You rap for a purpose and that touches us , Thank You Brother 🙏🏻 Joyner Forever ♥️
This hits hard from both sides
Lyrics made me cry.. so true..
I do not like the way jelly roll is singing it sounds like a girl in this
I needed this song right now ❤❤❤❤
Never heard Jelly's voice in Auto Tune before. Its really awesome. Great song by the way!
This song hits deep, I was married to who I thought was my soulmate for 8 years. To only find that he loved meth so much more than our relationship, and it turned him into a monster. Had to leave for my babies. Now he's serving 1-15.
I can't wait for the next banger
This song is amazing!
I have never. EVER cried listening to music the way I am crying as I am writing this. Wow. This one touched the soul.
I love your music I hope one day me and you can link up on a song
Fire brought tears
I fucking love this. Need more Joyner directed videos

Brought me to tears 😢😢💜💜💜🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 so fuckn REAL 🫶🏽
This hurt me so much. I had to break up with someone because of her addiction. And it still hurts me.
I'm torn on this one. Letting them go is letting them die but holding on is killing you
Love that not only is this song amazing, but the comments thread is a chain of people supporting each others sobriety. Amazing.
I’m a behaviorist and own an ABA company specializing in human behaviors.   Addiction can be anything from food, sex, anger, drugs, etc…  if you kill what the person is running from with those drugs then you’ll save them.  This person has a demon they are facing and are afraid to share.
This shit crazy 🔥 wow. Jelly too. 🔥 🔥
Damn man, your defiantly top 5 out right now! All your songs are 🔥
Commenting here so that I never forget this. Joyner you choosing topics of your tracks keeps you in my top 3 for ever!  I read a commentthat said. solution is not out of the situation but through the situation ❤
Holy shit Joyner ❤ and props to jelly to.
God I miss my dad... my whole life I watched his addiction to hard drugs and selling. Life without him since he died isn't the same anymore
🔥
Omfg song of the year!

Thank you Joyner and Jellyroll for including me in this video ❤ this message hits the deepest roots in my Life the struggle is real The Devil has his hand in alcohol and drugs we must overcome I am praying that we do! You are not alone
I had to pull over.  I as well don’t wanna get into it but this song just unlocked 3 years of backed up emotions. As a 27 year old man I just wept like a baby.  I wish I could stop for them but I cant😢
Excellent work Gents, first heard Jelly roll on Games track Summer time must say his super talented 😢❤

Tell the addict in your life that you love and care about them as often as you can and always be there to get them help when they are ready to get help.
RIP to the ones who lost their battle💔😇 Lost my cousin last April due to drugs being laced with Fentanyl. Fucking sucks.
I just heard this yesterday man I miss songs like this songs that told about situations like this we all need someone who's honest and gonna keep it real as much as we don't like it
Glad to see jelly roll getting the recognition he deserves. Been listening to his music since I was 8 . 22 years man. But this song really hit home with my brother. He just stuck in that cycle that he can’t get out. Like he can but he just stuck and had all the help he gotten from all his family. Since age 15 he’s been in the cycle and now he’s 36 and still doing it till this day. No job , no life, no will to change and it sucks .
👑
Whoever the actor is, his eyes hold pain. Hope he’s actually alright.
Love ot
@joynerlucasofficial  dope song.... love from home...508!!
We need a king iso Joyner Lucas song on this type of shi-.
I lost my little brother almost a year ago to fent, so I'm glad you fighting for the right reasons jelly but what happened to if my po ask I hang dry wall?? I been with you from the jump and I'm proud of you bro but we still out here in the streets and we need that street shit.
You see Jelly roll and Joyner Lucas on one track….you click!
Anytime I hear a song with this kind of content it moves me. If it’s about my past, or friends I have lost , or just dealing with life - music moves the soul and this rite here moved me. Made a grown man cry. I salute to you Joyner and jelly you already know what it is 💜💜💜💜
the visuals, vocals, lyrics. stunning as always Joyner. proud of you brodie
This song hits home for me thanks joyner
I lost my mom to drug use the funny thing is she was always worried about something happening to me but never looked in the mirror to see what was happening with her I gave her that unconditional love never judged her because I knew only god knew what she was going through real love is like marriage the good the bad the ugly and the the beautiful
Ngl I first heard you through I prevails alternate version of DOA now hearing this through knowing jelly, Im gonna start listening to more of Your music
I hope that anyone who struggles and wants to get clean can find solstice in sobriety. Hearing the second verse on this really made me think of the other side. I also know that it’s on US to make a change because the system shows no love. I recently just lost a brother to Fentanyl, he had been missing for 3 years and we found out through a google search and a confirmation phone call to the Coroner he passed. His ashes were left in a box for two years because they made no attempt to reach out to his family. The Coroner said they are simply stretched too thin on resources and get a handful of fatal OD’s through their door daily, and just can’t keep up. But that was someone’s son. Someone’s brother. Someone’s piece of hope and love. We need to learn to understand that sometimes change isn’t possible before acceptance and pure love.
Jelly sounds like a majestic Angel Look at Jelly's new teeth ❤🥹😁
I lost alot of family members and friends. I wish they had a chance to hear this before they passed. Thank you guys, This one here hits home. You guys did amazing on this. ❤🙏
I keep seeing the same question from Artists. “ we don’t know where music is heading, what to do, or how to transform”.   I’ll tell you, this.  This right here is exactly what the industry needs.  Real artists, real topics, melting pot of genres/cultures, and a future of love and unity through art.  That’s what I think I needs.  I think this captures that in every level 🙌🔥
look I would not say it if I didn't mean it you ever need me for any reason let me know I got your back I would die and kill for you and die for you you know it's true don't pretend you don't beautiful is what yiu are I know you doubt it dayley words would never be enough to tell yiu how much I love you it came down to me or you I would give my life in a sec if it came down to it sacrifice anything to you smile when your down and yiu feel low when your world starts to crumble remember I got you
Hard sad truth I had to learn u cant change someone u cant save them they gotta wanna change themselves to get clean❤Just be there for them I'm not sayin be an enabler if they choose to talk please listen!!!!! Ive lost too many friends to drugs. My kids lost their Father 5 months ago to HCV hepatocellular carcinoma cause he couldn't get clean long enough so they wouldn't treatments. Lost my people to Suicide from drugs, heart attacks from drugs, sepsis from drugs, car wrecks, need the list go on. We need help God Help your people. Thanks Joyner and Jelly an dude in video we needed this one❤❤❤❤❤
Bro this one here sent me into tears. My father’s child never got clean with me. Been 6 years

This song hits deep! Such a great song. We all know at least one person struggling. Loved this.
the old joyner is back
Crazy Collab!! One I didn't know I needed ❤
❤🔥
This is what Joyner does better than any other artist I have ever seen - paint a picture so powerful that it can't be ignored. I just lost my mother last Tuesday and she struggled with addiction. To say this hit hard would be an understatement. I felt this in my SOUL...😢
Who is the guy playing the addict in the video?
Chills 😢❤❤❤
One of the most substance-heavy songs of 24
Joyner been top 5. Give him his flowers already!
Nothing hurts more than having to say goodbye to someone you love who isn’t dead 😩😩
Wow I needed this song. Been battling my own addiction and lost my brother 3 years ago. I love the different perspectives  you hear in this. Joyner has done it again. Something so many of us needed to listen to
broooooooo! you just keep delivering great songs, I am looking forward to the album!🙏😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Badass song! I was waiting for Jelly to drop some bars!
This is powerful! I've watched ones I love battle addictions, some overcame and some lost the fight. For myself, I have been clean for 21 years now. And I pray everyday and give thanks for being clean. Prayers for all fighting their demons 🙏🏻💜
Got me crying
Wow ❤❤💯💯🫡🫡
I do not have any personal experience with this issue. However, through the power of this song it helps convey a message of love and understanding to employ the empathy needed for such a strong issue.
Saying “Powerful” if not enough 🙏 you are appreciated Joyner🫡 i know this one will save a few
Masterpiece.
god damn man..
This hit home for me! I’ve been on both side of this argument! I felt every word‼️😭

We all needed this collaboration
RIP BaebGurl, 6-5-23 Calyssa Jade Parlante, a beautiful soul left this world along with our child in the streets of Kensington. Don't give up on the ones you love. Rs. Stay strong, stay positive, stay growing and much love to those battling these demons.
Wooow 😢😢😢
Thank you for sharing.. This hits home with so many . No matter how rich or poor... God Speed my friends .
Have listened so many times in 24 hours and it brings me to tears every time thinking of my parents addiction struggle and my struggle to deal with them. Thank you for putting words to so much of what we can't say ❤🙏🏼
Oh my gawd. 🫶🏼😭
This the joyner I been needing to hear man 💔
❤✊🙏
Joyner 🧑‍🚒
Mmm felt that shit hoss!!
This is song that Addicts and their loved ones needed.... Joyner is a one of a kind story teller, and Jelly singing the hook knowing his struggles..how can you not be moved.
Ty so much
One of the best songs I have heard in a while . Wish i had the chance to make music with Joyner and Jelly . The microphone is my punching bag > I have over 300 songs I Have written . IM READY TO ROCK
Damn man do you always gotta hit us so hard 😭
Miss my father wish he could’ve heard this 😪
I dont like Jellyrolls music, but hes good as a chorus guy. JOYNER on the other hand never disappoints fr 🖤
sounds of revival@best videos ever
Best rapper and he's from the 508
Jesus, keep me... this path of sobriety is breaking. I feel as though I crumble. Keep me Lord, guide me... live in me, hold me, give me the strength... show me where it is so I can stay driven. Show me the sword and shield, so I might continue my fight... and overcome this demon. I am your soldier... Give me the tools to take up arms and finally slay the demon that is drug addiction.  I love you, Lord, I pray, Lord. Amen! I pray, Lord!
YOU WISH GOD DECIDED FOR YOU! YOU WOULDN'T HAVE F'D UP! BE GRATEFUL FOR EVERY LAST GOOD THING YOU HAVE! GOD IS INFINITE, BUT HIS PATIENCE ISN'T!
5.5 years clean... addiction is the devil. It truly is a disease. An addict brain reacts to chemicals much more intensely than people without that gene. Normal brains can intake a substance and not get an insanely strong pleasure from it that washes out every other joy in your life.
3 years 5 months and 13 days sober. This song hits hard.
Turn the auto tune off
I'm not a fan of Joyner. This one hits the best at the worst times. Keep dropping lifting moments for the ones who struggle. Resonate in the souls of the taken too soon.
🙏🏽
Fat clown pumps you up with smoke blood 🩸
Having a hard time not crying right now that’s some powerful shit that hits so close me and my best friend for over 30 years now have fallen off for a similar situation. Great and powerful song fellas!
Powerful. Had me in tears.
I have a nephew who is going thru drug addiction with pills he’s in rehab I just sent him this so he knows  I don’t judge I just love him and would hate to see rip 😢
6 months clean rn, praying for another 6 and move from there.. 🙏
Love this 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
@joyner Lucas that song is tough bro I felt every bit of that song u always put out the realist music fam
Here before the Millions!‼️TY Joyner & Jelly ❤
You are legend
Second verse hit me deep😖😫😫🤧🇿🇦connecting from South Africa
Big fan bro this was fired
This song is straight fire!!!
Unbelliavable
This is a fucking banger. Two of my favorite artists finally colab
Joyner you been putting out shit that be hitting so hard recently man. Congrats to you man this song is amazing
Love the story telling and powerful lyrics Joyner.
Much respect
Omg so real 😢
✊🏽
8months off hard drugs and this hit hard bc my child’s father is still using & ruining the chance at a future with his child right before our eyes.
https://youtube.com/watch?v=r6IbwFkrpsg&si=ODc7OhH0dnSN_1GR🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
So Beautiful.  Joyner and Jelly,  thank you Lord for bringing these two together.  This is helping so many in need right now 😊❤🙏
Damn bro. I fucking love both of you. 😢❤
One of my favorite things about joyner is how he releases his albums. If you really pay attention you will see it. Also think it's dope how he gives subtle hints at future songs and refers back to things hes said in other songs. It tells a more detailed story Than the track it's self. JOYNER I've been a fan since 508, your personal life is very simular to mine and it always seems like your timeline is one step ahead of mine which has helped me deal with my emotions to my personal and relationship issues with my kids mom and my son. Your music really helped thru some dark times. I've also been a half nigga my whole life and had to deal with identity issues and not fitting in with any group  where I from. Keep putting out music because I'd rather listen to your shit than go to therapy I ain't got time for that shit. And for the record I bought a f10 535i after Zim Zima just sayin. Keep it up my nigga
I pray the lord helps gives me the strength to get off this nicotine
This guy is not country and he'll never be country in my eyes. He's a rapper that's it. But this song hits close to home.
My favorite artist makes sure it hits the heart and my grown azz cry thanks for the love and entertainment and acceptance joyner
One of the greatest rappers of all time ❤
This has made me a ball of emotions. I have loved ones in this situation, so this hit home 😭😢🥰🙏
Here’s your flowers! 🌹🌸💐💐🌺🌷🌻🌼
Joyner is going down in in history for making real songs
Just like ross capiano idk the titel awsome man!!
Thank you Joyner 💙
For real let me go
You can ALWAYS count on Joyner to drop some deep track that millions can relate to!
1 year and almost 3 months clean from fentanyl. This hits home so hard.
Look at all the drug addicts crying 😂😂
I’ve been balling my fuckin eyes out listening to this.  I got out of rehab 2 weeks ago and overdosed 3 days later.  I love all of them but it’d be easier to let me go.  Fuck just let me go
On repeat ❤
deep.
Bro was just spitting on the block in a long white tee. Truly A 🐐
This shit broke me down Bro. I sat in a room by myself and cried like a baby. I lost my best friend, my brother, to addiction and this shit hit me harder than anything has since that time.
Thanks for pouring your heart on this one..
People getting out on by Joyner NOW that he did something with Jelly. Welcome aboard, Joyner has been putting out deep, heartfelt poetry  just as this for YEARRRRRRRRRRRRS
I love the song man. You and jelly are bad ass together. And this is a topic that more people need to face and bring up. To many people suffer in silence and don't know where to go to find help. Thank you for being aware and not being afraid to spread awareness
Fire, Damn you hit this and Jelly!! Gives me chills
They a dangerous combination Joyner and Jelly omgggggg I love both and this actually touched home with this song nobody will genuinely know what that person that’s addicted on is going through we just be so quick to judge without knowing they struggles 🥺😔
Very powerful! ❤😢❤😢❤
3 years since I changed my life. This song got me in my feels hard.  Everyone keep fighting 🤍
This man's music has helped me through alot of mental and emotional battles..Joyner the truth
My youngest brother David lost his battle with addiction in 2021 at 21 yrs old. He was suffering in silence I wish I could have done more for him.
Fire unexpected combo..Random but anyone know what those fly shoes are Jelly Rolls rocking?
Addiction isn’t just what a person what’s to do, unless you been through the hell of some of them and physical and mental abuse you can’t understand.  Probs a smoker or a person who used a bit of coke but has the none addicted gene that can take it an leave it.  The world and people right now are more evil and money obsessed than ever, for what?  We’re building it up to burn it all down, so the Bible warns, so does war with nukes.  Money changes people so whoever or whatever thought up the idea of it you should think about, and how you treat others to get it.  You can’t trample on people to make it financially and they pose to be a saint helping the needy hoping you’ll save a place in heaven.
Thank you! 3/1/20 is my clean date. Lost so many along the way and so many still out there. This hits home. 😢 Wish they could find recovery. Praying for those who will take their last hit tonight. Praying for those who suffer in active addiction.
Wow now that’s music! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥great work
🖤😊
beautiful song 😥
I like see Joyner n Cole get together on a song it would b fire
I have been clean for the past 4 months , i have been on opioids and other stuff for a long time , it has been very hard and people dont appreciate nor support you unless you’re trying to get clean its hard man. Not gonna lie i still battle demons to this day but i guess sobriety is the choice for me and i really hope i never be that person again.  Joyner music resonated with me ever since “sorry” came out . Music did save my life on multiple occasions and joyner always reminds me of that.  All love for everyone in the comments and i hope you win the battles no one knows about
@joynerLucasofficial I love this so much
500k views first day is insane
Joyner is THE best story teller. I love the angle from both sides. Video hits as always. Well fucking done man it's beautiful
God save my son he's only 22😢😢
man this song really hit at home im 20 years old and lost my mother and father along with all my uncles to drugs (mostly pills) I really appreciate for giving addiction attention man shit is the worst pain in the world to everyone and the ones around you. If you are reading this and are suffering from addiction just keep pushing everything will be ok one day you are loved I promise, it is not worth it.
I lost my brother in August 2023 😭 It’s painful. I’m coming up on 6 years clean in July. It’s hard asf sometimes.
Wish jelly was in it more
wow WoW WOW!!!
I love it! I've watched so many of my loved ones struggle with addiction including myself.
Two of my favorites together, hell yeah
The collab we never kno we needed mayne 🔥🔥🔥🔥
FIRE
click #meekmill
Banger 🔥
🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾💔💔😭😭
been a big fan since the tory lanez beef for joyner and jellyroll is a part of my character this song so deep man 💯
I just turned 50 homeless most of my life in a wheelchair the last 15yrs  and 7 of them yrs homeless or in a hospital I am about to get a apt every day is a new day and a struggle dont give up on yourself that new day is a blessing  keep your heads up Family  .Thank you for making that music that keeps me going.
The song is great But is that chase0
Best. Song. Eveeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Man I definitely approve this collab.
Great song but the choice of auto tune is very questionable and distracting. His voice doesn't need auto tune.
Incredible.
Beautiful bro, flow insane🎉
Jelly roll is giant nothing burger. You want to help fix this crisis of opiates? Get your Narcan training. It's free and you don't have to hear its wailing 20 times a day on the radio.
So thankful for recovery!
😎❤️💪✌️
My older brother is going through it right now! Hits deeps.
Battled Drug Addictions addictions to violence spent almost a decade behind bars. These are never easy convos. Big Ups to you and @Jelly Roll for putting this out. Keep it goin for MASS
Granny announced 🏆 ocse called frfr this shit hit deep around the 🌎  we all have a family who can relate 💯 😪 🤧
Hits home ! Hardest song out in a long time !
Way to go !?! ❤ support you both and glad you both decided to do a song together ❤️ 💕 💗 💙  loved it.
This Hits so close to home
This is amazing
For the ones that really pulled it through.
Joyner always makes real shit! His music has probably helped many people 😎. Keep it up Joyner.
❤❤
Man…this makes me miss my baby sister so fkn much 😢 she overdosed on fentanyl 07/05/21. She had a baby girl. I’m out here trying now to make changes so I don’t have to watch people die anymore. Overdose is preventable.  Beautiful song ❤️
Holy shit this is incredible..I still have chills throughout my body.. we do recover 1*18*20…
⛽️ ⛽️ ⛽️ ⛽️
DEY BOTH CAME ALONG WAY JELLY ROLL 615 STAND UP
Wow. Amazing
The truth..we just heard that..powerful and is affecting every family in some kind of way..best PSA I've heard in years, and I'm old(er55+) My own family has suffered losses and I personally pray for each one out there suffering 🙏🎶🎙💪
Very powerful. I have been struggling with an addiction to alcohol but you and dax give me music to get through it. Thank You.❤️🤘🏼
This collab is on point 🔥🔥🔥💯💯 jelly and Joyner 😳💪🙏
Best for me
I was sober and now It's all over. She threw me away like garbage and now the hardships got me tarnished. Wish I was stronger to hold on longer but instead I'm honored to be a monster.
Joyner is just too talented man it’s surreal
So damn powerful! Great message! Me and my wife celebrated 3 years clean March 3rd, we both come from family and parents of addiction. This song brought my wife to tears, it’s a great song with a powerful message.
This is what so many people need to hear ❤❤ , this is real music needed for us. I love everyone reading and out there going through something. 🖤❤️🤍🌹
This shit hits hard… feels like he’s talking to you but he could be talking to anyone. Still feels as sincere as if a bro picked up the phone to ask how you were
Wow!!!  I needed that video.
This one of them Joyner instant classics. Evey project got at least one of these but the storytelling, delivery, and chorus was just beautiful and real. Thank you for this song Joyner.
POWERFUL....
This song gave me chills. I got 1 month clean. It still hard at times. But so was my addiction 🥲
It's interesting how addicts often say or put their drugs in the sink or down the drain instead of flushing. So sad.
I have no words. ❤❤
Like this Song.....Truth Be Told❤
Repeat❤
Thank you Joyner & Jelly for this song I appreciate y’all this hits home.
I cried through this whole song! It is so good
😩❤
Your the man❤
This is the Joiner I like listening to. A message that hits home. Not the flashy, stereotypical radio rap. Adding Jellyroll to the hook was just amazing.
8,284 days (22 years, 8 months and 5 days) clean here!  There is hope.  🙏🏻
Repent and believe the gospel!!!✝️🤍
Deep
my ❤
Holy shit this is amazing! 20+ yrs of deep active addiction and I’ve been clean for 4yrs and my man nailed it with this song! Thank you✌🏼♥️
Thank you for this, had me in tears. I lost my mom 5 months ago to drugs and it doesn't get easier I'm just getting stronger. My whole childhood was watching her in and out of prison, getting hurt, coming down. Seeing cops raid my great grandma's to rip my mom out and not even let her give me a hug bye ( I was 5) . Now watching one of my brother's struggle with alcohol. 😢  I struggled with substances going on 4 years ago.  I became homeless when I was SOBER, after my family forced my great grandma into a nurisng home.  I tried my best to maintain a job while having my 2 year old and 2 cats in my car on the streets where we slept. A friend took me to a club, and i started working there, 6 months later with no hope, I started to use a substance. 9 months goes by and I finally chose to stop, no one told me to stop, I didn't go to jail, simply just because I wanted to be the mom for my child that I didn't have and I wanted to love myself.    Drugs suck and our mental health needs to be taken care of the RIGHT way.  Sending love and hope to anyone struggling with any kind of addiction. You aren't alone
15 years addict to everything under the sun. Now I'm just green an grow it myself. Haha.
Opinion: Joyner Lucas is our Eminem if you kinda think about in this generation his story telling is identical or at least similar to Eminem he is at least on the list of best rappers that is just my opinion🤷🏽‍♂️ JR with vocals bro killed it much praise🙌🏽🔥
I'm not even surprised any more , its what you do ,its what you've been doing .
Ubder appreciated
Jelly got that black eye smh
When you want to send this to someone but can't...
That part!  This song is a hit. Fucking amazing! I love both of you! This. Shit. Is. Untouchable!! Ugh. My heart.
Jelly and Joyner  got me over her bawling my mfkn eyes out 😭 They went hard and real on this one
🤯
😢
What a song
I wish I could find a way to contact Joyner Lucas and Jelly Roll.  I wrote a book about my journey through my son’s drug addiction.  I would like to get them a copy.  It is a book of hope and would love their feedback.
https://youtu.be/6PXWFxfvZPg?si=HmFro1KMUKY2Wjla
Bro.. It hurts. Mom.. She wont ever quit.
Thank you from a long time iv addict who is now on my 8th year of clean time from all hard drugs and iv use. I married the soldier that helped me get clean and now im trying to lay down the right steps to take the right path to hopefully someday earn my place in my two daughters lives. This song is something not only I can relate to but that my babies can relate to as well. This is how we heal!  ❤
Almost 6 years in recovery. This is beautiful. Joyner, you do not get the recognition that you so truly deserve. You’re a genius and way ahead of your time with this shit. Bless you and thank you !
Jelly x Joyner 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
New this was going to be so real and deep. Mad respect and my whole family suffers from this. I have over 20 some siblings, most of them struggle with their bad decision and temptation. Still on the wild adventure on discovering my family.
That one hits hard and close, alot will be able to relate.
pour it out my guy...!!! probably one of the most sincere songs i've heard in a real long time that talks about real sh!t.
How does he do this the rhymes  the lyrical bars dang the story line of a two sided  story 🔥🔥🔥joyner is something else
Amazing song, as usual, but I wish he didn’t use jelly roll. A female voice would have fit well imo. I keep fast forwarding passed the chorus to get back to Joyners verses lol
Thank you for this song, it a lil close home . I can feel this deep, much respect. WORCESTER MASSACHUSETTS 💪💪💪
Man this song hit me dead in my heart 😢🙏
❤ #Joyner a monster
Jelly you are so true both of you hit it on the head
This hit hard😢😢
Another corny ahh Joyner Lucas song where he is trying way to hard to be a lyricist that it’s cringe? Sure I haven’t laughed in a bit let me check this out
Damn this is deep
Best song and best video of 2024
💜 I love y'all that's deep.💜
Funny enough, yesterday was 3 years sober 🎉
Just got clean a month ago and everyday I live terrified that I won't be strong enough to fight it just felt good to numb the feelings.was just so overwhelming all the time. I feel the pressure. Was forced to get on methadone from CPS but now I feel right back where I started sick if I miss more then one day at the clinic. Don't know if I got the strength to fight getting off that too. I quit cold turkey, no comfort meds nothing. I was completely off of everything. I did it. All to have my kids leveraged over me that if I didn't do what they felt I needed to do I wouldn't have my kids. Mind you since the beginning of this case I've passed every single drug test. I was clean before the case even came about. Now I feel like I'm still of drugs, something is still controlling me because I know I miss 2 days at the clinic and I'm drowning again in the cold sweats, the runny nose, the hot flashes, body aches and nausea. So really how did that help me. I just feel like I failed again.
great song with a message but oh lordy that chorus 🙉🙉🙉
Crazy this don’t have millions of views already! This is music. POWERFUL.
The pain in this dear Lord 😢😢😢😢 #addictionkills #sobriety
@3:23 “take me as I am or let me be, tired of you stressing me the shit i got to do is best for me “ 😮‍💨

Two of my favorite artists, this was so powerful. Thank you for making this.
am i literally the only one who's gonna point out that the pill bottle in a song about addiction that is literally shown mutltiple times on camera is for the drug acyclovir...which is a drug used to treat genital herpes...... like bro who was ur f'n set designer or prop department? lucky u guys aint have guns otherwise a misfire that bad would have been on some alec baldin type ish.
Wow just wow! Felt that!
Song of the year guys!! Fucking amazing!! Chills down my spine from beginning to end! 🙏🏻 love
😭 masterpiece ❤
Absolutely crying listening to this. From a mom of an addict who is deep in addition 💔
Reminds me of my biological father being an addict. And never there. But calling when he'd be in the hospital beds. 20 years man. 20 years I'll never get back with someone who was supposed to love me as their son. Now here I am at 20 turning into the man I never wanted to be. I don't have a drug issue but I don't like drinking either I smoke bud to ease the stress but luckily I have managed to only do that
Joyner is a once in a generation rapper in terms of his storytelling and messaging ability. Period.
Noice
This video is meant for me so scared of being sober these opiates I know are not meant for me. PLEASE HELP ME
Who can help translate into Russian?
Hitting deep on this one…
This is where everyone learns about jelly roll and struggle Jennings and Yelawolf @jellyroll
Real artistry & Raw talent. 🔥🔥
This was dope! but also wish Jelly rapped on this as well
Oooouuuuu😮
3:03 that bar hit hard.
Lost one of my best friends to drugs…the last conversation we had plays in my mind almost everyday. He told me “I don’t wanna be like this anymore, I wanna be here for my daughter when she goes to prom or graduation. When she gets married.” I told him “now is just the time to reset and focus on the important people around you.” I lost him 3 days later. I felt survivors guilt in a way cause I tried my best to get him sober. I want annoying and down his face about it but when the opportunity presents itself I took a chance to tell him. It’s going to be 4 years in May.   To anyone addicted PLEASE try for those around you. Some of us humans don’t understand how to show/share feelings the best so sometimes our message doesn’t come across the best. We love you and don’t let this demon win cause people still need you.
I’m currently getting help for my cocaine addiction pray I make it through &’seriously give it up I got so much to live for . I have a family, a great job people who love me. I’m only 22

Joyner & Jelly Roll?! Dawg.. the world ain’t ready for this heat.
Joyner is the best rapper out, dude doesn’t miss and his message is always powerful
Say something about this video...
Joyner has always been able to captivate in so many ways. Worlds recent Bob Ross of lyricism and combined with Jelly's experience and expertise yeah this is history. Thank y'all!!!!❤

Wow. Bawling. I lost a dear friend to addiction. I so wish he could have heard this song. It would have reached him. I pray it reaches many!  ✝️
Just sing, why do we need the auto tune?
Damn
Fuck man. 😢  that hit home. I’ve been on both sides of that fence I saw it young and grew into doing it.  Now I’m a stronger better man.
i’ve had this on repeat since it dropped! love this flow from jelly in this great collab
Wow this hit home. After 30 years of addiction I'm 4 months sober. One day at a time, I'm never going back
Joyner in my top 3.

Got dammn Mr. Lucas😢 ya dont miss huh
God Damn this is deep!
I hate that the first time i hear a new one from Joyner it puts this lump in my throat and a tear on my face.  His music is so thought-provoking. These flowers are for you, Joyner 👇
Wow
Man iv lost 4 people in the last 3 years i have my niece and nephew i pray everyday there dad gets clean or we will lose him 2 i have to stay away cuz i been clean 5 years  shit kills me tho
Man I'm glad jelly roll is getting some recognition but I'm no fan of his CRAP 'country rap'
Addiction almost ruined my life but I am 9 years clean from hard drugs, and 2 years sober from alcohol,  and now I'm a father to a beautiful baby girl she will be 2 next month, and I have an amazing wife and God had me in hid arms the entire time
Great
Such a powerful song😢
Both my parents are addicts, tough in life having 2 parents from young who aren't truly there, I put space between them cause they ruined my life for the most part but it's a tough road that doesn't get much light in society. only good thing that came of it is my family is the reason I never dabbled in drugs.
Boy you two killed it everyword of this just hit the heart
CAN'T HELP TO DROP A FEW TEARS
With this past week I’ve had, this song is a masterful godsend. Thank you
Music for Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸 free Palestine
Underrated
Music for Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Thank you! I needed this. Been sober for 5 years. But addiction is a mental battle as well. Needed the reminder. Thank you Joyner and jelly!
So much Worcester pride! ❤
Free 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Free 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
This is one of the best songs I’ve ever heard
Free 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Best ever to do it🔥
My little sister is addicted to drugs due to being spiked by her own child’s father this song hit me so hard
My mom left 7 kids for 13 yrs and came back and is still living for herself. I never gave up on her and was always the one to reach out. I see her fight this disease everyday and it kills me. Now my brother is lost to fentanyl and I know it will only be time before i get that call for one of them. This song hit home on so many levels 🖤
I wish the auto tune wasn't so strong with Jellys Part. I bet he sounds 1000x better singing this live. Great song though! ♥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This song really hit home for me it really makes you realize
Amazing!
Damn the power in on this track 😮😢🐐
Hate that Joyner ain't mentioned with the greats
Beautiful!
@ 16 years old I lost my best friend to an overdose, im now 34 and lost another handful of friends to overdoses and I still haven’t dealt with losing my best friend. If you are reading this and struggling remember after every dark night there’s a brighter day, it can’t rain forever!
Another Classic 🎉2024 📍
This is probably one of your best. Probably my favorite. Damn…this song is way too real. The way this hits home and tugs on the emotions
Thank you joyner❤
Another legendary banger. Joyner keep it up. This one hit the heart bro❤❤❤❤
Joyner we love you bro
My brother does it again @Jellyroll615 ❤ it
Post malone be eating hard gawd dawwwwmn
I can totally relate to this 😢
🫡
Rip dad lost him few years ago to addiction.. and mom.. but it’s his birthday and this just dropped, proshate it Joyner. Rip papadoc  👑🔥💔
Bruh I about cried
Grammy🎉
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Additon can be more than drugs. Games, porn and masturbating, listening to secular music, just anything not of God is an addiction and im struggling with those and only Jesus can save
Within seconds of watching this I started BAWLING 😭😭😭 my mom 55 has battled addiction for so long and it’s getting worse every day 💔😔
Woww just wowww you always deliver  such powerful messages and visuals; it really speaks to the soul. 👏🏾👏🏾🥹
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ 🔥
Joyner is the best and iam proud of him and Massachusetts
Fuck yeah Joyner 💯
Joyner on a wave rn
This brought tears to my eyes. I hope this song heals those going through it🙏🏾💜
Been a fan since the beginning my boy future Joyner💪🏽 by far the best story teller in the world you can always feel the authenticity
Wow this is another collab we didn't know we needed!! First it's was Conway now Jelly I'm Loving the way your career progressed is awesome
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This song is so powerful! 😢 Joyner x Jelly! Fucking epic!
Another banger. Joyner is my favorite rapper alive and he never seems to disappoint me. I can't wait for you to come back to Philly.
Addiction is NOT a disease!! When you look at the brain scans it shows that its a habit that becomes an addiction.
Addiction is a thief  😢
💯 this gave me chills
great song
Damn, this hits in the feels  God Bleghss
Man super deep. Im feeling it otr
It's sad that this isn't trending when we're losing so many great people 😢
missed you joyner
JOYNER DOESNT MISS !!!!
In so many ways this song. My mind, my heart and soul came out in this song. Thank you God Bless hunnies
I was not expecting to cry omw to work this morning. Great song.
Here before 500k views !
🔥 yall killed it
My child’s father is in prison for 25 years , my child is 3 honestly this made me cry but the truth is the truth keep shining through your music cause your speaking to people ❤😊
❤
I feel this
35 days sober.  Someone sent me here
Aaaaayyyeeeee.... This is fire!
You hit it right on top of the head what's crazy is I've been on both sides of the coin this song is amazing and I think it's going to touch a lot of people
Living with a dad who's been addicted since I was just a toddler (4) to now ( 26) seeing the man he use to be vs the man he is now is crazy but saying goodbye is the reality starts little till it snowballs    I'm happy and proud of everyone who's been strong enough to quit and get clean. You're all so amazing and beyond strong I'm proud of you❤
Haunting song, thank you both for this gift. ❤
Jesus loves you all, stay safe out there.
Joyner came along.... in b/n the old and the new school, lyric + flow, God really love joyner, u r a beast
15 months clean off pain pills here. When i quit i was taking up to 30 perk 10s a day. I was making stupid money at the time and got none to show from it cause i recycled it all in bottles of pills. I’m working on year 2 of my sobriety. Prayers up to everyone going thru it struggling to get clean and stay clean. If your mind is wanting to quit, that’s the start, it’s almost impossible to quit if you don’t want it. You gotta want it, and get help. I found help and i stay reach out to my help cause i still go thru it. Trust it God and put the work in and anything is possible. Love yall
Just *Wow*
Another classic 👌🏾 #Joyner you the fucking man bro
Fire but reminds me of that Hopsin 😮😮😮
My mother died of alcoholism, and this song hit me in all the feels
I think its cool when joyner gets the extras in the videos to spit his lyrics. They literally gotta lessen the words. That’s so dope
Amazing!
Currently #14 trending Ok JR and Lucas  This a smash hit
This song hurt
I lost my bestfriend to addiction/suicide last year. The addiction side of the song was so spot on it gave me the chills. Brought me back big time.
Yall killed this one!
Shit hits my soul deep I’m going thru a Percocet addiction and it sucks and it’s so fucking hard man 🤦🏼‍♂️ everyone who’s sober congratulations fr not a easy journey at all 🙏💪🏽💪🏽
You're definitely one of the greatest storytellers of ALL TIME. Your heart bleeds into your music ❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🫡
Joyner best work in years . I understand the phase of flexing but this is what seperated him from the rest .
Unfortunately this is me and my sister right now. She’s been struggling for years and I’ve always been here for her but I get tired. She’s lied and stolen and broke my heart a million times but I don’t know what to do anymore.
I needed this
From someone who battled with addiction, this hits me so hard. This song gave me chills all down my spine. Thank you Joyner and Jelly, this song was like hearing a angel sing.
this is fire
Thanks a lot man I really appreciate that and I understand totally 100%, what you are saying
Just wowww as always
This video has those Ross Capicchioni vibes and I love it
Joyner don't miss...great and powerful song. It's not my situation but I can deeply empathize
27 months sober today from Alcohol and drugs. Joyner you are such an inspiration to keep going!
Joyner is a cheat code
Wow ❤🙏
RL Homies!!!🤙
I got so hype when i saw they collabed
This one hit my soul!!!! My cousin is bad on drugs and I’ve helped him his whole life but it’s hard right now bc I can’t help him he has to help himself and this speaks to my soul thank you ❤❤
✅💯💯💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the joyner i feel the most.
Why Jelly Roll sound like C LO here.
Perfection 🙏
the seconf verse was directed Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Seen jelly from pill poppers to trying to better himself and others that were around him amazing man who made it out of the mud but never forgot what made him who he is
So powerful 🙏🏽
This is greatness 🙌
Joyner is bigger than Jesus
This is what’s needed so much in the Rap game music for the soul music you can actually feel 🔥🔥🔥
Been waiting for this to come out definitely worth the wait
This is AMAZING!!!
Joyner a legend. Never disappoints. But jelly hook put tears on my face….
This one hit home! Haven't spoke to my best friend in years bc he is lost in his addition. I love you a.m. and pray for you all the time!
Thank you for saying what some are scared to say. Thank you for putting these feelings into words.  Thank you for speaking the real. Thank you for making me view my family in this video.  Thank you for showing the mind of an addict.  Thank you ❤
Nigga now in my top 10
This song makes me think of my kiddos dad. I tried so hard for 10 years. Addiction SUCKS.
Seriously one of the best songs ive heard in my life 💯
This hits home for a lot of us , this is the verse WE ALL NEEDED !!
Generational..Talent
My brother died last year, and now my best friend died last week. Shits ridiculous man. Thanks for making music like this y’all I been hurting man🙏
Iv lost many people to opiates. 5 family  members and one friend in one day. So out of it couldn't hear the smoke alarm and 2 of them were children . Fire department found my cousin autistic son behind the door and he was trying to get out but they had funny locks on 🚪 handle cuz he would sneak out and run around. I'm sorry Aiden and I miss you and Jackson. My aunt Uncle cousin her two kids and there daddy in one day. Found my brother one day on the floor in time to narcan him. I'm glad I stopped by to check on him. He was purple and had to give him compressions till the ambulance showed up.Screw the doctors that prescribed opanas like they were Skittles. They killed so many people. Now fentanyl is here and it's gotten so bad kids in my small town are dying from it in vapes. Messed up world our leadership has created.
I am so proud of all these people that got clean and staying sober. I love you and very happy for you all! I pray for the ones still hooked and the ones we've lost. The pain is real and they were selfish for leaving their loved ones behind. Prayers for all! Its not a disease, if it was you could never get rid of it. Cancer, MD, MS and things like that are a disease. Im just stating the facts. It takes a real one and strong one to quit the drugs.
Yo this is some classic..could we also get an homicide story.
This will be on reply all day
@Nolifeshaq
This one really hit home for me. Thk u fr fr
Beautiful work of art
Damn man 1😭🤧
God bless you
another Banger ,  powerful
amazing song and collab!
Almost 2 years sober, still feel this way still feel like it’s a disease I fight everyday within myself, every argument every aggravation just every emotion makes me want to run to numb the pain, but I’m glad, I’m super glad. I’m clean and I can say 🖕 Opiates!
Jesus man, your music is incredible. My brother lost his battle to depression and addiction, shit makes me think of him. Thank you.
🔥
Thank you i feell you talking g to ME
This was powerful. Had me in tears.  Really hit home....
Just want to give props to the actor in this video. The emotions, I felt that!
even when I can't relate to the issue Joyner talks about in his songs, it always feels like he's talking to me, empathizing with me and means it. The way he raps about this stuff you can tell he's seen and been through some stuff
My rap side and country side joining. Nice
Very powerful lyrics
I wish he would have had a third verse coming from the recovering addicts point of view.
God bless
That shit hit hard man
Fucking amazing!
Lost a friend to an overdose.  This song hits hard.
Just crying big ugly tears on my way to work this morning. No big deal 🥲 5 1/2 years clean and sober from any and all mind altering substances. Thank you for hitting home with this one ❤
dope af
When I first saw this I thought it was one of those fake remixes. Thankfully it wasnt.
Joyner never fails to amaze me
when it comes to this perspective type of shit, joyner is a god🙌🙌🙌🙌💥💥💥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Okay well I was not ready for the emotion this song would bring out at 8:30 am but here we are. Amazing song though but hard to listen to if it hits close to home
Your dialogues are out of this world, but please change voices or use two different voices to make them more dope. Dope song!!!!!!!
This is what RAP is all about!
❤❤❤❤
Daaaaaamn Chillz, tears, motivation,  perspective,  what else.........!?!  🔥 🔥 🔥
Hell of a collab.. Joyner and Jelly Roll killed it 💯
😞😞😞😞😩😩😩😭😭😭😭 hit home 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Another massive W on another topic. You were born to tell stories bruh, ain't nobody doing it better
Amazing song, i was there once on both ends terrible feeling either way. keep up the amazing work
8 months sober from meth, only Jesus!!
You saved me Joyner
Wow😮‍💨🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Great message as well
Keep making music like this . We all need this
Joyner finally making music with the goats. Dax next 👏
these junkies viding to their new drug taking song while saying they'll get clean which is the same lie Trump tells himself everyday so why should you have sympathy when you are a junkie
Joyner coming with real life things it hits your soul and you understand what he’s talking about. Jelly roll is killing it
I never meant to be the way I am but I'm just so exhausted with life
Maybe it’s hard for us to change because it’s all we see others doing and think it’s the normal. And news and radio all they talk about is raves festivities that are todo with drink and drugs. And even things we don’t want our children growing up and doing but it happens and we moan about it without making changes. All have to change not just one or a portion cause of theirs no balance then theirs nothing. Because people are quick to jump on someone to force change but don’t take the grain from there own eyes meaning don’t stop and change things themselves to break that change globally and responsibly so that’s why we stuck in this situation
You know that the last thing an addict needs is to lose anybody that could be a support system once they are clean. You can still love them and be there for them, without enabling them. When they lose everyone, they lose any want of recovery and the only thing thats left is their DOC. Addiction is like having the devil in one ear saying "this is all you have left, its the only thing that still loves you." Support systems are huge positives for an addict. You can encourage them but let the decision up to them. You can't force an addict to get clean, they have to want it for themselves. If its forced, it won't be long until they relapse, in majority of the situations.
Powerful 💙🖤
🕊️💙🤲🏽☀️🙌🏽
Jesus man… haven’t cried this hard to a song since How Could You Leave us by NF. Joyner is making some incredible music lately, I can’t wait for this album.
To ALL those who needed to hear this today click share and spread your HOPE 🙌
Two Words My Guys B-)
Deep! 🔥🔥🔥
After listening to this I've now decided to quit smoking weed. I've wanted to do it for a while and this song has just gave me the motivation. I be back in a month with an update.
I hope I never get that call I miss the old best friend 10 years ago I thought we would still be hanging out grabbing lunch now you won't even text me.. love you brother ❤
sorry mom but i have to do whats best for me
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best rapper in the world hands down .
$traight banger
😭😭😭😭😭i can relate to all this
Thats whassup ❤
This song just hits to close to home. My biological mom will never be the same she was so addicted she fell off a truck and went into a coma only to wake up and is missing part of her brain from the swelling.
This is song amazing 😮 wowwwwwwww the world needs this ❤
That line, "everyone calling that sh** a disease, making you feel like you in the right."   That right there is the hard truth.
❤️‍🔥 collab everyone needed
Powerful
Love your music bro really hits home
Just started the song but this duo is amazing.  I hope Jellyroll does some rapping on this too.
Thought Jelly Roll was a country Artist now!?! Said Upchurch liked and did too much Rap! Jelly Roll never should of got that award
The fat guy sings about addiction. Right…
Damn 😔🤘🏼
It's sad what people go through in their addiction but I refuse to call it a disease. You have a choice everyday to either take the drug or not. Disease is not a choice to have. Stay woke people. May good put his hands on all these people and heal that struggle 🙏
This is why Joyner is the best , hats offf to you Joyner hats off to you brotha 😮‍💨
🔥🔥🔥
The truth needs to be told about this certain rapper. Joyner is one of them one's. Honestly his name ought to be brought up with those other 2
Timeless tracks like these are what we live for,thank you Joyner
Its Joyner time ...lets goo
this song just reminds me of someone 😭😭
Love this song! I actually went through treatment in Worcester where you're from Joyner Lucas. Right across from the homeless shelter. That place made me never want to step foot in a treatment facility again. I've been in recovery almost 5 years now. 6/4/19💜💜💜💜💜

By far best song of the year so far the only wish jelly had a verse too since kt affected him and his family too but hands down absolutely 💯 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Sick wish you got jelly to rap a verse
Joyner is on a whole different level of storytelling in music. Em did it in the 2000's and no one else came out doing it till this guy. This song is crazy.
😢😢😢😢 May God heal 🙏🏾 everyone out there addicted to Substances (Drug) 😢😢
BRILLIANT, BROTHER. Please keep going. You're one of the messengers, and you message has reached as far as South Africa 🇿🇦.  Looking forward to the album 🙌
Damn, what an emotional song
🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥
this goes deep
Wow, just wow.. this song is a masterpiece that I’ll never listen to again.
Dammm amazing!!! Joyner & Jelly well done!!
This song gave me chills from starting to finish. An incredible collaboration between two amazing artists.
''But I have been alone so long... I''m harder to reach"... My current location😔
💉💊💔⚰🪦
Nobody does it like Joyner Lucas🔥 joyner never once has disappointed the story telling is A1 everytime and straight heat everytime🤷🏻 what can you even say?! Like seriously no modern day rapper can tell a story like joyner!
Bro Joyner is that dude. Such a blessing to the music world.
Ahh the classic Joyner persona convos🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bruuuhh! This is so relatable and this how it should be. I pray for my pops and I forgive him because now it makes sense, I wouldn't give myself to alcohol but I understand how he chose the bottle.
YO GO CHECK OUT MY NEW TRACK "RAP VILLAIN" ON MY CHANNEL 👀😏
I love this so much....
Dope congrats God bless kingdom business
absolute masterpiece. Just incredible
Saw the video on ig! I just came back to watch it again! This shit is outstanding 🔥🔥🔥
How can you turn away from drink and drug abuse. Smoking. Tablet addiction etc  When it’s rubbed in your face and everyone’s doing it ?  Or it’s on the radio spoken about to do so  Like speaking of festivals raves drink drugs like it’s good. Like life is just a party. That’s all you ever hear usually from those with platforms. That’s not helping people in the world that’s just the opposite. So why is no understanding about someone who suffers genuinely finding it hard to come away from stuff when it’s all we’re ever fed. So the only ones to blame are those with platforms speaking about it like it’s good.  It’s not !!! Never will be.   To anyone suffering and wanting to change be proud of yourself. Take each day as it comes. Stop worrying. Go for walks. Listen to calmer music and put yourself in a position with like minded people who no what it’s like to suffer. Don’t judge. Just help others and yourself.   You can’t look down at one person and judge them for doing wrong when everyone is doing the same. Hypocrites. I ain’t name calling I’m just being real.  And people don’t like the truth.     How can we change when it’s rubbed in our faces. And we’re laughed at and hated for nothing. 😢  Love and respect to those who understand real struggle.
Requesting Joyner Lucas feat. Dax🔥
Like he saw my life 😢
Mannn.... this one hits home hard! Thanks for doing this song from both perspectives. You have a new fan here, for sure. And thanks for reaching out to Jelly Roll to bless this song with you!! 🫡👏💪🤘🎙🎧🔥🔥🔥
You and jelly need more collabs. 🔥
Joyner makes elevating music with substance. This is what's lacking in music right now.
WOW! Joyner’ back! Jelly Roll was on point as well. This takes me back to “I’m not racist”, “ross capicchioni” and the rest of his dual perspective songs. Joyner really is an elite in the Rap game
Thank you bro this hit me in a way bro
Powerful
Grammy worthy
Yesterday was 2 year anniversary of having to take my mother off life support. It still hangs over me. 20 years it was us fighting her addiction. She is now free and so loved. God needed her more than I did. RIH momma.
Yall this gave me goosebumps
Bro  you the biggest legend to ever exist!   Your music always makes my day! U a real one❤
5 years sober of opiates from a surgery I had to have in 2015. I am about to graduate with my Associates Degree in Addiction & Recovery Services. I will be a chemical dependency counselor <3
April 3rd is my 8 years off herion and meth I started both of those when I was 12 I'm 32 and I have a wife full custody of my daughter this song make me break down and bawl my eyes out this morning before work thank you guys for this song it's a real one for sure
Damn yo wtf, This won't touch me in alot or Ways 😢😢😢
Over 12 years of F**ty. Only wish my mom, would of made it out too. This, and she, was a kick to the chest. I relate to every single word. Thanks guys ❤️ GOATS. KINGS. Saviors. Healing the broken, the forgotten and the damned.
Who told homie that "Jelly Roll" was a good stage name though? 😂 sounds like an old WWE wrestler.
I wonder if the grammys gonna overlook this sound too???
Man.. this is so good
Been waiting on this one ❤

Damn brother this hits deep, good job bro this is a great song, they all are
The song is 🔥💪
Man… you really know How to hit the feels. Keep grinding like that. Amazing work
InOk I'm gonna be completely honest here! I'm 64 yrs old and I absolutely do not like rap but I didn't scroll away... I listened...my heart started break and it's 4:30am now and I've actually got tears in my eyes. Addiction is most definitely a disease, people are dying and there's too many people out there that has a hard heart and little to no understanding. My sister had 4 sons and she damn near lost her 4th son to drugs she lost her first one in early 90's, then she lost another then another. Her only living son has been an addict since the early 90's and he is only here by the grace of God and I do mean that literally,he lost his life, laying on the bathroom floor overnight with a needle stuck in his arm his 15yr old daughter was at her frnds for the night and when she called to say goodnight he never answered his phone, well he never showed to pick her up the nxt evening so her frnds mom took her home that's when he was found, just in time,they had to shock him back to life and he spent a week in the ICU then had to learn how to walk again.  The sad things is he is most likely not done yet!
its just hits different when u actually got someone who is addicted😔
its just hits different when u actually got someone who is addicted😔

Wow powerful
Joyner one of them ones!!!!!♥️
Love ❤❤❤❤
Joyner. You’ve yet again made a grown man cry on something he wasn’t fully aware of how crippling it is in his life. There ain’t no one else like you man
NO WORDS FAM.
Joyner best story teller ❤
THE DUO WE DIDN’T KNOW WE NEED IT 💯
My sister and dad died thank you jelly roll for your music helps me get through ❤️
Song at the second Jelly chorus instantly shut me down and folded my emotions.    Been a very long time since a song with no warning stopped me in my tracks, broke the plumbing, and emotions.   This is an amazing song with a very forward and powerful emotional story which relates to so many people.    Somehow, this is more than just music.    Damn.
Hope this song change somebody's life out there❤
If you never believe in yourself you never believe someone is believing in you
You never miss!!
THIS GUY IS A GENIUS 💯
I felt alone when I was addicted. I was trying to die everyday, only to sit back from a distance and seen all those I would've hurt. We don't have to go through life alone. This song is great!
this song has me in chills
Wow , incredible
I can't tell you how much this song touches my heart I have been clean for 5 years on April 17th but it's a struggle everyday and this song describes my whole journey and the battles in my head ❤ thank you ❤
Made me cry. I’m at a loss for words. Wow touched my ❤
Joyner this was a true masterpiece stay blessed truly love ur music
The fact that you use your platform to help people I respect you Joyner and I'm going to work on a track with you just give me time.

@magicdustman

Been struggling drug addiction for some time now, i just drew strength from this song, it will give me so much more in my fight with this disease
Omg jelly roll shits fire bro run it up
The power of the message in song, leaving me speechless
You coulda had jelly rapping. Still love the song yall both did great but I feel like Bubba rapping would have sent it to mars. No hate just love. Great song
Deep af🫶
10yrs a heavy alcaholic. At first you never want to quit because the pain destruction hasnt set it long enough. I feel like every time i quit i find another piece of me thay will help me start my new life. Im 24 hours sober and as i sit here waiting for the night to pass i ifeel like i see more light then darknes. I feel it in my sou the desire for sobriety manefesting its self.  ❤❤ One love. Stay strong everyone.
🖤🥺🖤🥺
Like both perspectives and jelly rolls hook👍
HOLY S#IT! What a song!! Got goosebumps& Hitted home Hard..... damn.
This song hits home My  unfortunately lost the battle 3 years ago
As an addict this track hit hard.
Now joyner and NF 👍
4 yrs clean ♥️ you’re not alone in thinking it’s impossible, that everyone else can quit but me, that maybe your family is better off without you
Rip to all those we lost to this poison
Incredible as always dude. With Jelly hitting the hook. I lost my mom to addiction almost 20 years ago. Keep doing what you do Joyner!
My mom died in 2021 of a fentanyl overdose. She was the kindest person I’ve ever known. Then nine months later, my ex-wife left me. This song hits hard. Very well done. Another banger. I’m going to a Joyner concert in June. And it’s the most excited I’ve ever been for a concert and I saw Eminem a long time ago.
We Needed this G!! 🥇
God bless those who made it out, and prayers to those who still struggling.  May they find hope and light and love.
Great bro appreciate
An absolute tune
Great song and calab
Joyner is back again. ❤❤ this takes me back to his glory days😢
It's crazy listen to this while you just developed a habit on some drug
Thank you
This is so not what I expected when I seen the title to the song… I’m so fucking emotional… my aunt is in rehab right now for drugs…and just this is..there are no words for this…all I can say is this is amazing I love this so much… and not just my aunt but im sober now…and I just this is…I’m speechless… so speechless…
Damn this hit home, great lyrics great hook. Much Love From OhiO Namaste 🙏🏼🙏🏿💪🏼💪🏿

So sick!! Just don't like jelly on auto tune
Joyner on another level... Every damn time!
💯💯💯 deep🔥🔥🔥
I missed this part of Joyner! flipping classic!
this the one
Jelly roll always touches my heart
I spent 13 years of my life homeless on heroin in streets of Kensington in Philly. I have 7 years clean now and never thought I would see the day I got my life together. I'm extremely grateful to wake up everyday in the apartment I worked hard for with food in the fridge and not have to get high to feel better. I literally came from the gutter to where I am now. This song cuts deep Joyner and jelly roll did a great job on this one.
Storytelling always too pure
he on his baggggg.... truly amazing
I discovered this while staring at 7 lines and wishing it was all gone. Sometimes you just need to ask yourself “is it enough to stay”. Amazing song, I hope this helps others through the process it’s a long journey but hopefully we make it out in the end.
No ...thank you Joyner I appreciate everything you're doing for the music industry you're the rare talented artist I've ever seen and heard can't wait till the album drops Friday 💯
Never seen this collab coming but boy am I glad that it came you all did a hell of a job on this song congratulations
is this about a gay couple ?
All I have to say is, THANK YOU FOR THIS MASTERPIECE.
drugs
Lost my brother to Fentanyl.  It's painful. Every pain he tried to escape through drugs, I felt. We weren't twins. We were close and we loved each other. He was 32 days sober when his relapse killed him.  Now, I'm out there handing out narcan hoping to prevent this from happening to others. But still, it's happening numerous times a day somewhere in America.
One word “Amazing”, Thankyou Joyner ❤️
Joyner you'll always Be my favour Music Rapper❤never had doubt these album was gone Hit hard 🔥 all love to you Man ❤
I cant stop listening to this song it hit me hard but could we get a jelly roll verse like just a fast one his voice is amazing❤❤ yall need to keep rocking it
i gotta watch it twice as someone who used to have addiction problems
It’s not love if you have to ask yourself or anyone else. ✨🥲
I always feel when Joyner goes in 3rd person mode it's always raw and that shit hits hard
Belly the chorus killer ....
Man made me miss my mom ,havent talked in 9 years had to separate from addiction but still got hope ,
Wow joyner wow
as a mother, daughter, sister, addict….thankyou
💓🔥🔥
This hit me so hard because my father was on drugs nearly my whole life but he managed to beat this addiction and was sober for 5 years up until he was murdered. I never gave up hope that he would beat addiction and im glad he completed his mission before god called him home 🙏🏿
This one hit really home being a former addict myself, Thank God  i been clean for almost 7 years now . I lost alot in that time but in the end i gained more that family and True friends mean everything cause i had all these so called friend when i had dope and sharing it but when that stopped they disappeared!! But the whole time i was addicted my true family n friends stuck with me and ended up helping me get the help i needed. Keep the real ones around you at all times no matter the cost
Man, you got the story telling raps down to a tee. And you tell both sides every time. Joyner once again you have made a masterpiece of a track.
Joyner 😢giving us reality
7 months exactly today that I been drug free. The journey hasn’t been easy but it’s definitely worth it!
🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥
You casual fans keep saying old Joyner. Joyner never changed!!!! This is what he delivers on a regular. This song touched my heart man. I’ve been battling a heavy alcohol addiction the past 3+ years and this song reached me in a way I was not expecting. It brought me to tears. It’s way too relatable. They are so gifted. Thank you Joyner, thank you Jelly Roll. I’ll beat this.
#masterpiece🤩🙏🏻🫶🏻
❤
Love you guys! Your music hits hard! Real life music right here. Keep up the great work we need more music like this nowadays ❤
🎉
In Tears knowing that my Brother is that person 😢 .....
Loved it . I wish jelly had a verse , from his perspective, either way , another banger
Damn really just gave jelly the hook
Never disappoints bro big fan from Australia 🇦🇺 joyner lucas one of the best right now
One of the best rappers alive But underrated

.
Thank you for bringing back your storytelling. Bringing me back to Ross Capicchioni and Just Like You

Love them while you have them.
Love this I'm going on 4 years of sobriety.
Damn... i got goosebumps right away...
Thank you for this. THE INDUSTRY needs more. 🙏🏻
Joyner is him
Daaaammmm...Joyner is pure Genuine 🔥
that shit is deep as shit on so many levels.  Good for Joyner for trying to help a huge problem.  Wow
To me Joyner And J. Cole Are The True Preachers Who Keep Playing D’s Rap Game ❤
I think this is my new favorite Joyner song
Going through some things harder than I can ever admit with someone I love and it's harder than I can ever push myself to push myself past the situation
3 years sober off the sugar, the guy I used to do it with just passed from it being laced with fetty, I got lucky 🖤
This hits too close to home in every American home across America.  Our government not only allows deadly drugs to come across our borders and flood our streets with drugs our government also has made a deal with every pharmaceutical manufacturer on earth. Our government has managed to create an addict in every household and they have made it seem as if it’s normal to have addicts on every street corner in every democrat city across America.  Is Our Democrat government trying to kill it’s citizens? It sure seems like it.  Stay strong America! We do not have to be what our government wants us to be! STOP THE MADNESS! JUST SAY NO🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 ✝️✝️✝️
I honestly do not watch many videos anymore at 56 but grew up on them and this song and this video hits My ❤️ Blessed for My recovery and pray for anyone still out there....
💛☠️
This dude a real artist with his music. Both sides of the story. To bad he don’t get that radio play much.
another classic both sides take from Joyner, modern day zeitgeist allegory and the video adds another layer too.   singles are top notch every time, but we need another album, please!
One of the dopest tracks I've heard released in 2024❤
Liiitest
Who's running out tomorrow to get them   2022 baby Blue    Reebok  pumps
I teared up 😢
it hits hard
Chills ❤👍
Remix it and give jelly a verse
This song and video is deep asf and touches home to so many!!! Job well done fellas
Love your new teeth, Jellyroll ❤❤❤
I lost my best friend to a drug overdose in 2020... This definitely struck a chord in me... RIP Danny...
This is the collaboration I didn't know I needed
Jelly Roll❤❤
Wow! This was so beautiful and another powerful example of how talented, thoughtful and brilliant Joyner is. Thank you, Joyner. You are a real artist and are doing much good in this world! Jelly Roll slayed it on this song too!
Y the hell this make me cry bro 😢😭😊 4yrs sober

Wow
I PREFER THE TRACKS THAT GO HARD AND THE ONES LIKE WAR
Thank you Joyner ❤
Thank you for this, Joyner. A classic.
I’m glad this song dropped. I’ve been fighting with visiting the cemetery for a few years now. I think this was the sign I needed. RIH Brandi Convery… you’re never forgotten honey… Thank you for this masterpiece.
Jelly roll and Joyner Lucas you guys are two of my favorites and this song really hits home!I would love to meet the both of you some day! Keep making these real life songs one love; Jacob Wilber your biggest fan
🔥🔥🔥💥💨🏁✌️❤️
IM NOT A BIG FAN OF STORY TELLING RAP
❤this is it too much to ask for a J.Cole feature 😊
KING LUCAS 💯💯
Wish Jelly didn't use auto tune he's a good singer without it but great track for sure.
As a current drug addict this hit me hard. I have a great job, I support myself and I have the best 2 brothers I could ask for. I'm trying to get clean but man I'm going off the rails. I need help. I should really start going back to church. Thank you Joyner Lucas and Jelly Roll!🖤 This is another wake up call.
hits so deep all i can comment. ❤‍🔥
Joyner going back to his story telling love it
Jelly roll found a whole new pocket
1:02 😢❤
I'm here...
❤❤❤❤
CRAZY!!! chills all the way through.
Thanks Joyner
If this was a lyrical lemonade video he would be trending right now✌
So amazing still to see jelly getting big Collabs the growth has been amazing to see. I wish there was a jelly verse on this bc he would have killed this with the subject matter. But still an amazing song !
Joyner going back to what he's good at 🔥 relatable music, story telling video.
This is the song I’ve been waiting for! Absolutely best duo!
Music that matters not all of the other thrash out there. Thanks Joyner!!!!!!!!
god bless you Joyner.
dope af love them both.
This guy hits me in the feels everytime 🫶

I wish Jellyroll dropped a verse but that hook was amazing. Great vocals from both artists!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fuck this made me tear up good 😢
This is for my brother. He is going through some mental struggle, I used to think he's weak for that. It breaks my heart now that I know better. I see you bro. I pray you come out stronger!

FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This shit made me cry. I felt this in my soul. Bravo to these 2 legends

This story telling is so catchy 😢
Shed tears listening and watching for the first time. This is the music that touches the heart and soul!
Missd ths type of joyner Am glad bro...luv the song
Masterpiece ❤
The collab I thought we'd never see.
Fuckkkkkk. Hit home HARDdddd!
Lost my uncle this last July to addiction 💕 song hits close to home
on the better days and i got a rock song written
As a former addict this song hit hard.
Isin't this "I'm not racist"  guy?
This is by far the best collabration i've heard in 2024 so far! 😤🔥😤🔥
Joyner bruh! As a recovering addict this shit me deep. 9 years clean off pills next month 🤙
Ndikhou ambela Venda lothe ndo panga malamulele na giyani... nikhourwa mah Joyner... rini funa lunwe nga hafha
long live joyner. this is a masterpiece❤
Damn that song hits home in many ways... I've been in both sets of shoes and i pray for those that are still stuck in there addictions that they find a way out before it's to late! Everyday is a new beginning, a fresh start! It's never to late to start over! Life is precious and i love and miss all the ones I've lost along the way!....
I’ve got 2 family members that are addicts and both are doing very well these days one was my mother since she was 14 but I just wanna say to anybody battling addiction that you are stronger than the addiction you just gotta believe that and I know it’s hard but you’re still here for a reason ❤️
You can't do something you don't have so for someone to CHOOSE to get addicted to something is just crazy to me because you don't just become addicted to something by taking or once.
My uncle pushed the whole family away. I loved him to death and wanted to see him do better. Always believed he could kick his addiction and return to the person that I knew. He was never the same after becoming addicted. He would kick the habit for a few days to a few weeks or months, then he kicked it for a year or two only to fall back into that state. While he was addicted, he stole from every last one of his family members, including me as a teenager. I forgave him time and time again, but there was a breaking point where I stopped caring about his well-being or existence because I simply had to do what was "best for me". I've had several friends die from addictions to hard drugs. I was always there for them but because of my experience with my  uncle, I learned that you cannot force change upon people who do not want to change. These mind altering drugs are a poison and I wish our society would realize this and push back against them.
This is that music!
Collab of the year.
Y'all we need 2 Dixie cups and a string so we can chat  but real  shit shakes
Today is my sober day celebrating 8 years from methamphetamines.. I bawled like a baby listening to this song.. praying for all those who weren't able to get clean
Since Eminem hasn’t released a new song yet. Joyner has been my best rapper
It's good, but God Dang j Cole dropped my delete later 2😮😮😮😮
If this song makes you want to tear up. Then you can relate to it 💯. The realist song am hear all year.
Lost a good friend to an overdose, and it’s a miracle I’m here from how much more I did than him. My roommate shook me and when he did it restarted my heart(very low pulse). I got my dead homie tatted on my back and won’t ever do another show without shouting out his favorite song of mine and performing in  Been 3-4 years sober now, that demons a hell of a thing and you can break the grip if you want to, the hard part is addressing the trauma that sent you to the drugs in the first place.  Addiction is a disease, but the way it is initiated is similar to catching a life long STD, that person chose to have (potentially) unprotected sex and caught it yet we don’t insult them for having it or seeking help, we address it and help it Addiction should be seen the same way
Ooooweeeee
Damn.  That was really good.
sheeesh
oh fuck I cry and I never do.
First song in my day in the morning :)
🔥🔥🔥
Undeniably beautiful ❤
I just cried... 😢 u can choose to not love me because you don't understand why.. 😢 love is what makes us find recovery
Omg i absolutely love this new song
I love and appreciate every one of yal. Thank you 🙏🏾 hopefully this helps you or your loved ones in some shape or form 💪🏽❤️
❤❤ 🔥 🔥!! I cried 😢, meant so much… loving an addict it’s real asf. I hope he sings this on tour ♥️
Tupac said it best “ Have you ever seen a crack head, that’s eternal fire “  No such thing as hell stay off drugs I’m fighting a weed addiction now.. stay strong Jehovah is the way 🙏
Damm Joyner, you had to hit me hard with this. Then you used my boy Jelly Roll, I was in tears within 45 secs. I keep to myself, so nobody ever has to ask me if I will.  I'm a drunk, I deal with Amity and Depression, and someday I want GOD to just call my name already. BAD thing is GOD knows I'm a fighter, and I'll keep pushing, I know GOD has plans for me. Thank both you guys for making this hurt so good. 🙏🥲😪💔
This song is amazing. I have been clean for 9 years and this song hits me hard. It is almost like he is telling a story of my past. Joyner is a True Artist.
Verse 2 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🎧
🖤🖤🖤
so hard. damn
Wait a minute…. Who’s Joyner Lucas to this guy? 👀
The best collab in 2024❤️ This song is out of this world 👍 We missed this kind of great music.. Respect 🌹
Fuck, this is amazing!!
Wow !!! Two amazing rappers/ artists doing their best thing. Pure perfection 🥰 ❤😊
2 and a half years sober here and married to the love of my life whom I have spent the last 10 years with, whom is still in active addiction... again. This song hits soooooo close to home. Definitely brought on the water works. I LOVE Jelly Roll and now Joyner Lucas!! Thank you for this soul healer!
🔥🔥🔥😭
As soon as I seen Jelly Roll on the record I knew what the topic would be. Y’all nailed it. Absolute masterpiece fr this is a bitter sweet beauty. God bless everyone in recovery ❤️‍🩹 Joyner ain’t never miss 🎯
This is why I love this shit
WOW ❤❤❤😘
smh snapz
great song.. Sometimes you can do too much production of a persons voice though;  Jelly roll has a great natural voice, this effectively made him sound like every other heavily synthetically tuned voice in modern music.     Let his real voice sing on this track and the whole thing would feel way more authentic.    Still a beautiful song though.
2 Grammys Song and Collab
Every household in America should be playing this
Caffeine addiction is real, I promise.
This one hurt 💔😢 I love you ma

Waterworks rn!  Thank you Joyner and Jelly Roll for this brilliant view of addiction, and the heartbreak it causes.  I don’t know anyone who hasn’t been hit with the demons of addiction, whether personally and through a loved one.  The manipulation of the addict shows me they truly get it.  And it’s a beautiful song 😢
This goes soo deep👊😢✌️🎶🎵🎶🎵🙏
✅🔥
This song got to me really hard this album is going to be a masterpiece
We didnt deserve this but again Joyner delivers...also JellyRoll....amazing work both ends
Not knocking the message. But this was corny af. I only came here for jelly and this sucked. I don’t know who the other 2 dudes are but jelly don’t need auto tune crap and those dudes suck
Joyner is incapable of making a bad song 👏
Always GOATED. Joyner
Best song of 2024; two of the greatest.
I didn't listen to jelly roll for years but Joyner Lucas is slept on way too much. Every time I bring his name up on any kind of post and I say I think he's one of the best rappers people laugh and joke about it. I don't understand how anyone that listens to any music by him cannot think that he is a excellent rapper
Thank you Joyner for continuing to put out this music that really means something. Music that makes people tackle reality instead of hid from it and let's people connect through their pains. We're all going through so much, you're bringing us together through our shared pain to help us heal each other. What you are doing is big and I appreciate every bar you're putting out
Bro tbh my night Joyner goes harder than everyone besides maybe J.Cole his storytelling is on Biggie level deadass
An unexpected great collab 💫
Robert Sterling forever 31😢
😢😢😢
NAH JELLY DID HIS THING
You always go hard. Hands down my favorite rapper!!! YOU ARE THE GOAT!! I WISH I COULD DO A SONG WITH YOU BIG HOMIE
I literally just was talking and praying for one of my best friends who is addicted to alcohol, meth, fentanyl and opioid’s.. Crazy how God works.. Joyner does it once again!
This song makes me think of my ex that died of an od....went to save this song and the only folder option to save it to was the one named after him 💔😥 what I'd give to go back and not be so naive about things
Flows unmatched.
WHO WANNA SEE A FEATURE FILM BY @Joyner ?
My grandma died from trying to self rehabilitate when her first grandchild was born 😢 I never got to meet her I hope this reaches someone out there. Don’t be afraid to reach out for help if it’s too much for you. You’re never alone
You two should do something with Doobie.
This is the collab I've been waiting for. Two beautiful artists comin together to make a beautiful meaningful track, I have family n close friends who struggle wit addiction and this song almost had me crying. Addiction isn't something to play wit or something to joke about some people struggle so hard to change but can't without help n I'm glad people are starting to push that in there music considering how many artists are out here addicted to lean or pills
Darn bro that hit different 😮‍💨
What a well written story! Run this all the way up.
Can we get more of this? What a crazy colab🤘🏼
I battle alcohol daily. This speaks to me. I hope I don't lose my family.
Great song
❤❤❤
Wow love this
Joyner been #1 in storytelling for me for a minute now 👌👌👌 the lyrics just hit different every time
This needs to go #1
Joyner has always been true to his "filmic" storytelling. I would love to c sum mix media joyner writing and directin a film :
Jelly Roll FrFr Hit Dem Notes 🔥💯
Beautiful song Joyner Lucas & Jelly Roll next we need Dax on a track!
Both Snapped 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn that's the crib that Goodnight Shirley video was clipped back around 10yrs back... GETTING SOBER CAN HAPPEN FOR YOU TOO
👁️♠️⚡️🤘🏻⚡️🤘🏻⚡️🤘🏻
Amazing as always!
A truly heart felt song. It digs deep and grows a flower in your soul. 🌹
Genuinely brought tears to my eyes  This song hits hard man... just... wow
I haven't stopped re-playing this song for 30 minutes
Dude was story telling and bustin 3, 4, and 5 syllable rhymes the entire time. That’s what really sets Joyner apart on top of the great storylines. Technically sound af.
❤❤educational rapper ❤❤
"if you don't believe in yourself you will never believe somebody believing in you"  #Facts
Growing up watching my older brother nod out and having to pick up his motionless body from it, still alive but dont wake up when im dragging you to bed makes you grow up real fast this song hits way too close to home, Thank you Joyner for this masterpiece. God Bless Everyone
shit like this is why you're in my top 5
For all those struggling out there and coming to the comments looking for some sort of relief. I pray for your salvation and that it finds you peace without causing yourself harm. Please hold on and reach out for help if your struggling. Keep moving forward with love in your hearts and minds ❤
bro…
Absolutely amazing. Joyner really is the best rapper still going
Absolutely love this, as I am in active addiction myself.. my daughter jus showed me this as thus is what ive been working towards, but its not always that easy... Biggest for me is to work through my addiction, to acknowledge and accept and move on from denial.... Step one then after that it will be one day at a time. I've had 10 yrs sobriety under my belt, so I know what needs to be done and the steps to take to achieve sobriety.. even though I've done it before, it's still a scary process.. Im not 100% ready but i am getting there.. Reaching for the will power. Thank you jelly roll for all that you bring to the music industry from day one...  Much love from Minnesota
Might be top 3 Joyner Lucas songs
WOW this 1 hits home for me in more ways than 1 well done Joyner & Jelly... Like how is this not trending already?
Free my Bro Jay Smith!!! Hopefully this time you get out and break the cycle…change your life and live free and drug free!!!
This will probably shut Stevie up
Such a fiya collaboration.  I'm hoping to see Joyner and Russ someday too!
Is the guy gay or whats the point of the story? Im confused.
Bro how do you keep putting out these conversation type songs on different topics and make me keep coming back for more. So many friends lost to addiction. This song hit me in the gut but in a good way.
Hit those hot topics in the mouth.  You Savin lives with your art.
r.i.p Mac
Joyner joyner joyner, how many times did i call you lucas😂...... you gonna kill us man..❤
Thank you Joyner and Jellyroll! this song is amazing!!!!!
Holly fuck this song hit me hard because I've been on both sides. This song is a masterpiece that everyone should listen to because it could help a lot of people
💛🖤❤️‍🔥
Some of Joyners best writing here. Love how he cares to make music that helps people. Jelly Roll is the perfect feature for this. 🖤 Love from NE thank you for this art and message
Joyner is the best rapper right now and deserves being in people’s top 10
Speachless amazing
🔥 🔥 🔥

Wishing you the reader all the best of God's blessings.
Absolute fire!!! 🔥 This one hit hard ❤
You look like you give really powerful hugs!!…… want a hug?
I don’t get how this relates so much to my life right now. It’s crazy, brings tears to my eyes.
jelly is a beast
Beautiful song
Joyner is a true legend ❤
This is the type of Joyner shit we like ❤
One of the dopest songs and videos I've seen in a minute
This is some of the deepest and realest shit ever wrote love the fact that you have both sides.of the story
🤎
😭😭😭😭 I'm feeling this so hard...😔
Awesome and pretty cool watching my son's cousin play the addict role. Good job Mike!
I watched 3 of my kids go through addictions. Almost lost 2. This song hits home.
Yow this deep 🔥🔥🔥
This, Right here, is why Joyner is in my top 3 of all time. No modern rapper can compare to his story telling. Not this mumble rap bullshit about killing and selling drugs. And Jelly!!! My man! Been a HUGE fan since I heard your story as well. I relate so much to all you been through and done. I will be jamming this shit for years to come. And Joyner, see you Worchester!. (wistaaa) 😅😅
I love this combo. I got chills!!!!!! ❤😢 So beautiful. Thank you guys for this.
Thank you for another awesome song! Much appreciated! Love you Jelly Roll❤💜
Joyner just made me like jelly roll they should do more music together
I felt every lyric made me tear up I just came up on 7 years sober and this is exactly what I needed
This was deep😢
🔥🔥🔥
is this a message to Mark Wahlberg?
The power of this song, this message…. Ty ❤❤❤
You a DEMON on the Mic
This is gorgeous
Yooo - shout out to my guy keepin up with Joyner’s flow.. lyrically and emotionally that was fuckin solid.   Cool as hell seein Jelly Roll and Joyner on somethin together too.   See you in Phoenix at the Marquee man. Appreciate what you do!
Joyner is a goat, for real.
Just wow!!!
This song deserves a Grammy. ❤🎵 This issue needs attention!💊💉
Dear Addiction; how’s the past doing?
🙏
Damn this hit me and I love jelly rolls voice and your raps joyner
🎶
Thank you, Joyner !!!! You never disappoint, shoutout to Jelly Roll!
10hr old lets see how far this song goes  #alltheway thanks Joyner
Joyner tapped in on this one
Joyner on that based rapper kick, first he's doing a show with Dax and now this! Fire!
I saw him breath around 1:10
Beautiful song
He probably talking about his white homie logic.
I felt this way to hard 😢🔥🔥💪🏾
Is this real?????
Joyner is the best hands down
Lost both my parents to addiction one of crack and the other heroin . I was 18 when my mom passed and 24 when pops went , I’m 38 now n I still say 🖕drugs .
im not crying your crying
I live in South America, we have some shit that is like Crack called Pasta Base made from the shit that's left over from when they process Cocaine, they are very similar and it has many young men stuck in that cycle including a few old friends and a cousin that last fcks me up, haven't seen him in years and those who have seen him have told me that he is really fcked up, i hope he gets outta that BS man if you a addict keep your head up seek for help but most importantly seek for yourself you're still there just have to let go of the chains the fall is scary but trust in yourself YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE!
Love it so dus my ant she loves  it
Joyner, THANK YOU. 🙏🏼
Omg this is deep....this hits so much different when you're experiencing it😢
Dis really hit different wen u went through it 🔥🔥🔥
Truly beautiful
I’m not used to hearing jelly roll auto-tuned 🤔
Love this song brothas 1 love TRU DIZZO
Great song, great lyrics!👍👍🎵
Ay man ima fan Joyner but I aint even playing this trash 🤣 eminem ain't doing a song with this bum for a reason. This ain't the vibe man.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🤍🤍🤍🤍💔💔💔💔😭😭😭🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
I truly believe if you're there and push someone to be that better person when you do know they're struggling, most people will become that. A lot of it stems from having nobody or just feeling like they have nobody or who even gives a fuck? Just show someone you give a fuck and you may be surprised. Just be there for them, stay strong for them and let them know you're always going to be there. Everyone needs something to hold on to and someone to hold them down. Addiction is a horrible thing and most don't want to do it just to do it. It gets to a point they do it because it's what they feel they need to to get by but if you can get them away and take their heart to New heights, and get them past that few days of FOR REAL feeling like total shit, it's all mental after that. Abandoning them will never fix it and it will definitely never help. Just take them away before they lose themselves.
Soul music for real. Thank you brother.
Fucc 😢
Joyner is an amazing story teller. His music is truly inspirational. Need more artists like this.
Homie got a hairy shoulder 😅 song is 🔥
it's been awhile since a song made me cry. Specifically, Addiction Kills. Being recovered and dealing with family with addiction, this song hit hard.
Had a busy day and just seeing this. Omg love love love ❤
The world needed this.
FUCKING HARD AF!!
It affects everyone from every culture
Another amazing one!!! Joyner gives us another important song❤❤
To everyone hating on this song because they wanna compare him to their favorite rapper is insanity. First of all, you can’t name 3 rappers that speak on real world issues in a style like this. Stop comparing Joyner to your favorite rappers that haven’t been relevant for 20 years. J cole is cool and yeah he makes great music and is obviously still relevant but his music is meaningless compared to Joyner. This isn’t a blow your car speakers out kind of song. It’s a reality song. It’s for the people that have suffered through addiction and/or lost someone to addiction.   Lastly to say this song was only made to get on the radio is crazy because the radio would never play something this real.
Let’s go! 🎉🎉🎉
🫡
🔥🔥🔥
This woulda made alot more sense if there was a girl addicted. Fruitloops.
Man this is the BEST! I can’t wait to share it with everyone I know. Cuz Everyone I know has been affected by it- either has the disease of addiction or loves someone who Does . It doesn’t discriminate. And PS alcohol is a Drug* anything that is a mind or mood altering substance is a drug. Thank y’all for this Song
loving someone and letting themmgo is what i had to do with my ex wife during covid. literally the worst year and a half of my life.
This shit hits hard. i lost my sister to addiction. Thanks for putting this out there.
Very well worded. Exactly how it feels I have been on both sides. I was an addict and my brother still is.
Support and Respect all the way from Pakistan 💚
This is the collab I never even thought about for real. But so damn fired up that we got it. This that 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I love how Joyner paints both sides of the picture. Well done Sir,
I'm sorry 2024 ❤
They need to do a remix n let jelly spit a verse
My wife is addicted alcohol, this song came out 3 days after she blacked out, attacked me while holding my 10 month old son.   Life is dark man, thanks for your music Joyner
I see new joyner song expected it to go hard and something to ride to while on my way to work. Only to start bawling, knowing i’m the addict… I needed to hear this at this moment of my life.  Thank You
Too deep, too real, too true. I've been on both sides. 😢
SAAAANG THAT SHIT JELLY 🗣🗣
🔥🔥🔥
You put everything i having feeling in song
I remember when joyner used to take rappers beats and rap over them and look where hes at now. Keep it up!!
Love when two powerful artists from two different worlds can come together to make magic like this! 💯 Classic here
This is absolutely amazing💯🔥
Joyner back on his shit let's go
great song
Smh #Heavy

This guy blows me away again and again
How can you love someone And learn to let them go How can we fall apart on things  We didn't know   Have you ever loved some one  More than you loved yourself Gave them all that you never gave  No one else Then they up and leave you Just before times got hard  No all you have left is just Your faith in God  Now you are broken ang crying Over things you don't know How can you love someone Knowing you have to let them go
Another level of deep..
Maaaaaaaaaan. Joyner never disappoints. Honestly neither does Jelly Roll. This one’s an epic dub
I'm 6 yrs sober,  I have been an addict over half my life, this song just speaks to me about what I have been through and put my family through when I was in active addiction, this is why I love jelly and Joyner they speak about real issues that so many people battle with everyday!!! Absolutely incredible song especially for people that don't understand!!!
this is amazing
You take us on journeys with these epic audio/visual masterpieces.  🔥

This to me is music at its finest glad Joyner an jelly roll got in the rap game the way they story tell an reach real lives instead of rapping about bullshit is the greatest to me
Amazing song brother it's deep with all what living now it's true ❤
@nolifeshaq
That dude here is da truth
Jelly roll and Joyner Lukas are the best rappers in the country and hip hop genre
Losing the love of my life to drugs. He’s not dead but he’s not himself anymore. He’s nothing but hate, meanness and selfishness now. I pray to God every night that he’ll change for our son even if he can’t do it for me. I hate addiction. I’ve never known pain like this.
Best rapper alive🙏💪😎🫡
Joyner flow is always on point with his flow with every beat he raps on. He really deserves his flowers because he always speaks the real and turns it into a smooth song💯🔥🌪️🐐
GEESHHHH , Joyner has to be top3 story tellers ever

Jelly roll is the white Natedogg…..the new king of hooks
What am I seeing this is unreal 😳
Felt this...
This kinda hurt to listen to and brought up a lot of memories, but It's great that yall added that message to the end ❤  Amazing song
Got me tearing up sitting in rehab right now got me in my feelings cause I can relate all too well
Wow man this song made me cry thank god I was one of the ones who made it out when so many of us did not
shout out to the old joyner coming back and making another good song
So f*cked. I literally moved out on a 14 year relationship yesterday, due to their addiction...  and this song comes out today from two of my favorite artists.
Strong words bro. You're the best out there.
this was an awesome collab... jelly and joyner killin it.... and at least the guy that died on the floor got to see the rammstein stadium tour.... that was a bad ass concert!
Thanks for making a grown man cry
This hit home 😢
I lost in 2006 when addiction took my father from me….
7 years clean and I have watched this happen to many times! It's hard watching a person barrel toward the cliff's edge and you have to let them go. Their journey is their journey. Just like mine was mine.  Its hard to watch and try to be supportive at the same time. Even my Mom had to do this for me. (RIP MOM) Thanks for the song. I hope it reaches millions but I know from personal experience as long as it reaches one person and helps save their life then it was worth it.
This song hits the ❤ different
Yessss I've been waiting for this to drop❤
Man…. I shed some tears on this one Joyner the way you wrote this in the position of the addict tho ❤️‍🩹! Jelly & Joyner LEGENDS !❤❤❤
Dropping the drums out for the second verse made it hit so much more for the video. The song itself has drums on the second verse. Really interesting. Great track
Straight up tried "LIKING"   it three times forgetting I already had LMAO
Damn this some real shit right here!!! I feel like he’s talking to me in the 1st verse and yet talking for me in the 2 verse 😢😢Dammm
🔥
All I can really say is powerful!!!
Damn I went from having a pretty cool day to be in all up in my fucking feels..  ❤ Fucking amazing 😢❤😊

This song hits me in the feels so hard just like I’m sorry! Have 14 years clean and have lost so many fuckin$ friends to addiction.
So fucking incredible

Wow talk about relatable. 🎵 Music is Magic 💫
🥺🥺 this hit home hard personally 💙 so relatable
Add he has done it again🎤 drop!!!
How the fuck did y’all drop this song for me? My mother was addicted and I cut her off. I’ve spent the last 3 days cleaning out her house after she committed suicide. I wish I could go back and love her as she was
Bro this isn’t just a song. It’s a story of many people’s feelings & lives. Straight up this will have you deep in your feelings 💯
Joyner… Bro you stay dropping nothing but 🔥🔥🔥
Wow, you are amazing. My son just turned me on to you.I am 58, and now I am downloading all of your songs. You are awesome, seriously  ❤. I lost to my daughter 4 years ago, and this says it all. She really was a great woman, but it was the monkey on her back. Still feels like yesterday.  Thank you ❤❤❤❤
❤
Just had 2. Judge me I gives a fuhk partly. Partially patterned to the toxic. Last chick almost got herself lockt and I said she didn't check me. Ain't talking payment I loved her strongly like pavement like the tide and names written inside that's where the wave went. Our love closely behind yeah she was older than me and I was hoping I'd find a sign. Looking up at night seeing a star shoot across the canvas. Wishen for her back. Then thinking bout back when I lost my partner he overdosed in the restroom ofah 99. We use to go bananas on 99. Now I damn this picture I had and so did he. Of me and this lady making it happen even out of this tragedy. Rest.In.Potency. My gee. And the lady that left me stranded I gottah do what's best for me. Contact me if you make it through your disease. Much love.
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙

Grammy
I love this song
How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 1: Joyner Lucas] Yeah, I got somebody I love (Yeah) Someone who's really important to me, but now they addicted to drugs (Damn) Someone who not who they used to be and we ain't been keepin' in touch (Yeah) I ain't gonna say any names at all 'cause I don't want no one to judge (Woah) But I wrotе this song in hopes when they'll hеar it, they'll never forget who they was I hope you feelin' your spirit enough (Joyner) I wanna just tell you I love you in case that you really don't hear it enough (Woah) I know we ain't talked in a while, but fuck it, I really don't care what it was I wanna reach out, but you keep on shuttin' me down, or you ain't been carin' as much And what the fuck happened to you? (Fuck happened to you?) You're losin' a fight (Damn) I never thought I'd see the day that you let addiction ruin your life Everyone callin' that shit a disease and you makin' feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like Or do what you might (Do what you might, woah) And I keep on prayin' and reachin' for you I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I been seein' in you Hope your reflection'll send you a message and show you this shit is much deeper than you If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you When I gotta tell you truth (Tell you the truth) 'Cause I'm 'bout to lose it (Lose it) And you wan' deny all about it and just wanna make up a million excuses Tearin' our family apart, but you'll leave us scarred and everyone bruises Every decision affectin' us all and if you get lost, then everyone loses For real And I'ma be next to leave I know that God got a plan and He ain't fulfillin' your destiny Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me   Torae 'The Bubble Chip' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Genius Verified  Torae 'The Bubble Chip' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Genius Verified  [Chorus: Jelly Roll] How can you love someone and learn to let them go? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know? And isn't it funny you can change your ways For someone to fill in your empty space? Tell me, is it really love if you have to ask if they'll stay?  [Verse 2: Joyner Lucas] Look, I know you been callin' for me (Yeah) You hittin' my phone, but I been alone so long, I'm harder to reach (Joyner) I know you ain't say any names, but I got a feeling you talkin' to me I hate when these demons get into my soul, I feel like I'm caught in the beefs (Uh) How do I look go of something I know is something is bigger and stronger than me? If I could be honest, I'll tell you the truth, I'm not who you want me to be (Nah) Nobody is perfect, not even you, so why you keep targettin' me? I feel like we can't even have a genuine convo without you startin' to preach I feel like a dog on a leash, it's not what I need Livin' in hell, warned you when I gotta leave, like how can I breathe? And how you gon' tell me addiction's not a disease? Fuck do you mean? If it's not a disease, then why has it gotten to me? It's not what it seems But you always be makin' me feel like the problem's me I'm not gonna be who you want me to be, let God decide it for me And speakin' of God, how the fuck you know all of the plan's He's gotten for me? So give me a break I been inchin' away from tryna get outta this dream, I'm driftin' away How come you only there for me when I be tryna get clean? My biggest mistake Is me wishin' that things were different, I feel like the drugs is made for sinnin' It's why I been stuck in the same position, fuck I'm fallin', but I cannot budge Been wonderin' why I'm in love with a strange addiction And why the fuck you always playin' the victim Lot of this shit that you hate to mention It sucks 'cause I had to taint your vision But ain't nothin' left for me So you could just quit addressin' me I guess it's just my destiny So take me as I am or let me be, I'm tired of you stressin' me 'Cause shit, I gotta do what's best for me
Dude Jelly killed the hooks, better than I imagined. In a time when most artists are rapping about the highs they get, industry puppets, we have two independent icons creating beauty in a positive way. Love you both for this.
This is definitely gonna go #1 💯🔥🔥🔥
Jesus only March and this is already song of the year hands down. Will take a lot to dethrone it.
Had me thinking off my brother who I haven’t seen in 6 years due to incarceration
Wow just another banger keep up the good work bro ❤
Dang 😮 this is beautiful
RIP all my brothers that passed away from drugs love you all ❤❤
😭😭😭
Not me over here boohoo crying 😢. As a  cook at a drug rehabilitation center I've seen a few beautiful souls give in to their addiction and it never gets easy.
Joyner is on a different level! I’ll always appreciate these type of songs when he speaks from different perspectives!! All love!! 💪🏾💪🏾
Joyner the goat 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🖤🖤🖤🙌🔥💯🙏
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
There goes Joyner doing it again!!! Jelly Roll too this is straight 🔥 can't wait to see you in NY Joyner im amped!!!!!!
That’s deep💯
One of the biggest flex's in this generation is seeing former drug addicts like myself get sober and show others struggling in the dark that sobriety is possible.
Wow...just Wow. 🫶
As a guy in recovery from a pretty bad heroin addiction. Thank you. Felt this one.
Today marks my 5th year in sobriety....this shit is a disease. It wasn't always easy but it's true. One can change their ways, takes hard work, takes being vulnerable, becoming accountable for all the damage and hurt we've caused...Life goes on, shit happens but knowing I have a choice is what gives me strength everyday to not throw it all away for a drink or using. It no longer consumes me...just for today. Because that is all I can do just for today. Sharing my experience, strength, and hope is  something I continue to do to those who are still suffering. I don't want to keep what I've gotten, I want to give it away because it is truly a wonderful and blessing of a gift. So for anyone who reads this and may be suffering, you're not alone. You don't have to be. You can change. Just don't give up.

As a person who has been on both sides, and currently in limbo, this hit hard. On both sides. These 2 are doing big things with music and addiction.
This dude is hands down one of the best to ever do it he is so underrated 💪🏽
This is some deep thoughts. I love Jelly's voice here. This gives me chills. Listen to the message.
Such a powerful song

This hits home hard. I loved an addicted person for so long. It almost killed me. I had to let him go or I was going to die. My life is 180 degrees different than it was 11 years ago. I beat my addiction and healed myself with the help of the love of a good man.
Joyner, more plz
🫡🫡🫡Absolutely incredible 🫶
This song right here speaks volumes & this is the best duo by far! For someone whom has overcame addiction and just got out of a toxic situationship that involved drugs this song hits home for sure! I'm praying for anyone struggling with addiction that you get the help you deserve and see the light at the end of tunnel, life is to short to be toggled up in that mess. Thank you Joyner Lucas & Jelly Roll for this new hit! 🎶🙏❤️‍🩹
Preaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaach boiz❤❤❤❤❤❤

I got 27 days clean for the 100th time and I'm finally giving up the fight. Time for God to take over.  I'm getting out of my own way. !!  P.s whose here before 200k views?
I’m a mom who lost a son to addiction. I felt this song to the depths of my soul. 😢
🖤
Oh geez this made me cry. 😢 Thank you for pulling back the curtain and exposing the pain so many are feeling.
I lost my brother to fentanyl. This song speaks to my broken heart.
Songs like this made me a Joyner fan. Ross, Im Sorry, Im Not Racist, etc. Ill support him no matter what type of music he releases, but songs like THIS is where he separates himself from the pack.
Song hits close to home, I started to tear up a bit, hope everyone that has an addiction, can let it go. Do it for the people close around you, and if you don't have anyone, then do it for yourself, because your worth it 💚
It’s crazy how they release this song today me and my brother had a fallen out. I had moved him up here from Virginia to get him clean off alcohol about a month and a half ago. He left this weekend with a bunch of lame excuses after doing better than he’s ever done left his job left the car he bought. I found the bottle he was drinking over argument and use that as an excuse to run back to the hills. Epic timing Music is powerful
Wow
Thank you joyner lucas.. thank you jelly roll.. song is on repeat
Dude this is next level and it also showcases that old jelly roll that everyone loves and combines it with the new ! I love it me ! Truly
Broo" masterpiece
Thank you Joyner. That last verse was for me i needed it. ❤
Jelly got a damn voice of an angel on this one ☝️
The marathon goes on we shall not stop , We can never let the hard times humble us. Cause the game is gone  test you. 💯💯✅✅✅ @Joyner Lucas you did your shot on this , Going platinum 💯💯👏🏽👏🏽✅✅
This hits to hard
Best story teller
The collab we never new we needed

I needed this today. 😢
Love this
Damn Joyner this songs hits the feelings too close to home . And you got the jelly roll with you on this one . Instant classic .
Amazing storytelling brother😎😎
Very Very Powerful. 💯
Joyner doesn't get the respect he deserves he easily up there with Cole and Kendrick. Real rap
Man, Jelly and Joyner get me every time ❤
Wow.😢😢
Can relate to this🙏🏼🥺✨️
I know people who got thirty years sober. I have 11 months. I even quit the weed. AA offers steps, principles, tenants, and prayers to connect you with God and repair relationships.  What I found is that we as addicts and alcoholics have to break out of that victim psyche. We truly have some of the best hearts and with fentanyl in everything nowadays. Using just isn't worth it at all anymore. And drugs and alcohol make every problem worse. You can change, I did, and I was using for 7 years on and off. What ensued were psyche wards, rehabs, and me not admitting I had a problem. My cousin, an addiction specialist kept telling me theres light at the end of the tunnel. I then started to realize, I had to stop. I went through sponsorship to Oak Forest Recovery in Southern California, where I got sober. Sometimes, all we need is a change of environment and people who want to see us win. Good luck to you, all my brothers and sisters. Ps. Joyner, thank you, bro!
Fucking love Joyner, and with Jelly?!?!? Perfect collab.
This was a really good song.
Heartfelt 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
VERY DEEP! this is definitely the Joyner everybody misses. dope record1 ill listen to anything joyner drop though
Why does the pos Music industry. Need to auto tune jelly voice
Your talent for story telling sets you apart bro, Wretch 32 does something similar in UK
having walked in on a friend who overdosed and had to be the one to tell his parents this song hits me soo hard, the visuals, the lyrics, all of it RIP buddy
Appreciate Joyner cause god music just isn’t the same these days.
This is next level bro!
🙏🏼
Wow this is powerful well done you two
fuckin jelly made it dude, on a track with  joyner bro.....talk em into in next homie
This shit hits so close to home.. I've been slowly losing my brother for 3 years since we lost our mom
You the best brother
Unpopular opinion this won't trend because it does not have g_n violence, it's not a bunch of mumbling, it does not have a bunch of half naked girls twerking, it's not glorifying all the usual negative stereotypes. Prove me wrong. Make this song #1trending. I"ll wait.
It's about prospective,  don't expect shit from a judgement
Thisssssss needs to blow up
Done did it again. Y'all both legends in my book bro.  Thank you so much. You'll never know how much this song hit me.  Music meets you where you are. Here I am
Ive never clicked on a song so fast in my life. This shit had me in tears smh 🤦‍♂️😢
The addicts story is the TRUTH
I LOVE THIS SONG!!! 1st time hearing Jelly…#Ready2RoLL ❤
Yes!! Joyner raw too dont get me wrong but i been NEEDING a new jellyroll song  thats a little more of his old shit. Fuckin yes. Yall did that shit.
This gave me the chills
So good
MASTERPIECE
You are the legend!
Amazing song! The best duo for this track!
This is why Joyner is a goat 🐐
Real Rap, Relatable Content, True Artists. JOYNER LUCAS & JELLY ROLL 👍🏾👍🏾👏🏾
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐐🐐🐐
Jelly and joyner salute kings and thanks for this wonderful piece of art
Bawling because ive been on both sides. its really a masterpiece if you ask me. Idk if ive ever had a song resonate so deeply
Loved the song before but now the visuals got me feeling it more
Bruh this is powerful ❤
U know dude grabbed his plumbing tools about 15m after tossing em in the sink lol... for real tho, truly is a struggle on multiple levels. Good to all trying to get clean, baby steps n u will eventually get thr!! Stay strong!!! 😊
10 years clean and my wife stayed!! ❤
The pitch correction on Jelly Roll’s voice was not needed in my opinion. He’s already got a good voice naturally.
Joyner is the realest
Dude…… smh 🔥🔥
Goosebumps 🔥
Still waiting on the jellyroll Millyz feature.
I can't stop crying, I can't stop listening. Some ppl make music, others speak to souls ❤
Amazing song, I can relate to this with a family who unfortunately took his own life. And I wish I could have helped them but it was too late but you have to learn to let them go and have their memories stay. 🙏❤
Wow today I'm celebrating 18 months sober today and then this song comes out today. I really needed to hear this after drinking for over 30 years and being sober now this song touches my soul 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 beautiful song from 2 of my favorite artists thanks to you both 🤜🏽💥🤛🏽💯💯💯
This hit home to hard!!!!
Its fucked up that authentic music get underated
Chills...
I knew this was going to be hard to hear ...... Just... Wow... Wow❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😢❤❤
Joyner and Jelly roll really know how to pull at heartstrings. 🔥
incredible song, jelly roll with auto tune hits different
Always passionate and passing a message to everyone that ❤ Always making impact with reality 🐐  This is piece 🐐 Crazy how he makes them rap to his lines 😂in video shoots too #love you Joyner 🇳🇬
This is the original Joyner we like, not the new flexing Joyner
This is seriously powerful, it had me in tears. As an addict in early recovery both verses touched me.
Absolutely amazing. And now it’s going to play on repeat for the next 10 months. 🫶🏼🤣
Look, I just got out The psych hospital like last week and a lot of the friends that I made in there are addicts.. and that's hard because I hope that I never have to hear from them or their families, they have slipped  Back into their old ways
Mannnnnnnnnn this is fire  Aye Jelly we love you bro G’s up Another Grammy  #CashvilleStandUp
Words right out of my mouth.
❤ 💯 love it all facts 💯
Can't wait for Stevie Knight to react to this but BIG PROPS to Jelly Roll and Joyner. Masterpiece track right here.
This song hits hard when your an addict.   Even in recovery it still hits hard.
I can't stop listening to this.
I used to like jelly until the whole upchurch ordeal should go and apologize for threatening people if he's such a good guy..
Definitely hits home!!!!
yall crying not me
Finally❤
The I'm not racist flip absolutely got me man, hearing both points. It's insane.  I've literally never heard anything that has spoken to me like this. Almost in tears. It's fucking crazy love from Maine and Texas.  This will be a daily banger in my house.
2 of my favorite artists on the same track... 🔥
The auto tune kills the truth.
Haven't heard the song yet but the fact they have a song together I feel like it gonna make me cry Edit:Omg as a former addict this absolutely has me in tears
Joyner GOAT
I have followed Joyner Lucas from the start and have recently discovered Jelly Roll what an amazing collaboration. Absolute fire 🔥 you have helped me through the toughest times I am forever grateful 🤘🏻
Wow. That's really all I can say.
Hits . . . A lil too close to home ! 🔥 tho fr
Speaks so loudly 😢 Thank you for this song! ❤️‍🩹😮‍💨
Love songs with substance. Amazing jam and relatable to a lot of humans.
Man, I’ve been dealing with whether or not I should put my addicted loved ones feelings above my own. I needed to hear this song. Big thanks guys ❤️❤️
Bro, this is deep..
Damn bro u kill this type shit every time💨💨💨🔥🔥🔥
As someone who had an addiction for 2 years, I can relate. I'm highly thankful that I was able to climb out of that dark hole and get my shit together cause a lot of people don't make it out. Even though I've been clean for about 3 years, addiction is a continuous fight. For those currently battling addiction, Keep fighting. KEEP FIGHTING!!!!!
This joint hit me with a TON of brinks. 🔥🔥🔥
Once again you hit home bro… you and jelly are the biggest reasons I’m still here today. The music you guys make has saved and changed my life over and over again.. it’s good to know others see the struggles we go through everyday.. you guys deliver every time. ALL LOVE
Thank you for going back to your roots!❤
This song has the power to heal an addicted soul.
Wow what an amazing collaboration!
Did anyone else get the chills just looking at the thumbnail?
Powerful lyrics. True art.
I want Jelly to do a collaboration with REN so, so bad. If you know REN, you know what I mean.
Bless your soul Joyner❤
I wish Joyner would produce a whole album just with story telling like this masterpiece.
This feels like Sorry pt. 2. I love it 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm addicted to cigarettes and herb, but half the people in my life are addicted to meth.  I can't ever find the words to help them see.  This hits hard. I need help. 😢
Bet 🙏🏽☯️
Wow wtf just one them songs where lyrics seemed like they for me exclusively
if this is played at his show in Toronto with Dax, I might have to go now. I already wanted to see some Dax and Joyner but if theres new material from Joyner on top of Dax..
I got 10 years clean from heroin. Jelly huts my soul. And Joyner will always be best dead or alive. I still have our picture up Joyner ❤
Best song of 2024
Why do I feel like during that whole song Jelly Roll was just staring right into my soul. This is an amazing collaboration. I think you guys both did amazing beautiful lyrics.
Fuckinf incredible, that chorus gives me goosebumps!!!!
Joyner always hits the spot😢
Honest to God. I'm off a stretch of sobriety for a few weeks now. And I was honestly just looking for somebody to talk to. An this fucking song came on.  An it hit me hard man, this shit is so real I felt it from my toes to my head. Y'all are awesome.
Love the message. Keep the light shining
This song is powerful
Good lord this song is amazing
Magical
This song is awesome Joyner, you can go hard like anyone else but not many artists can deliver something this powerful. Looking forward to more to come! :)

Old school Joyner! Great collab
This is a truly amazing song this is how I feel but I am the problem and the motivator in this life truly
Joyner é foda!!!
Wow!!!
Amazing song everyone should listen to this rich poor middle class/sad happy depressed/ and the ones that fight addiction everyone ❤
I absolutely love this song it truly speaks to me about myself before I got clean and sober. 16 years clean almost 9 sober, it was not easy to fight the disease of addiction
This song just gave me straight goosebumps.  On of my favorite songs I've heard in years. Y'all are fucking crazy.  This is straight art.
Joyner and Jelly? COLD!
Powerful Joyner song with Jelly Roll on the vocal? Yessir! Love it.
Love this song. ❤Really like Jelly Rolls range in this song. This connects with me and so many others. ❤

As a person that has been in recovery from some pretty harsh addictions, this song really got to me....especially the addicts part. I felt every word!
This is a long overdue subject ! I can relate  I had to walk away from friends I cared for  that 1,000 % couldn't change .Do not let the industry drag you away from this message !! Finally the type of song the other side can relate to.Sad that others promote drug use please stay true to this message and  do not change .
Damn I felt this one in so many ways. Joyner never disappoints. Can’t wait till Friday!!!!
So POWERFUL!!!!!!!!!

Love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you feel alone or have no one to talk to go ahead and comment. I know there are many here that feel that way if it's your case. Comment here and know that you got a friend in me.

That’s why I’m not mad at anyone who left me behind. I chose my own dark path and it’s my own to walk. I know my truth and maybe one day in the end we can all look at the bigger picture together and laugh about it.
❤❤❤
Sounds like the old Joyner! Jelly’s melody on this is just magical as well! Well done song.
Gain a new listener “Me”. 🎉
Man that dude that played his boy put that man in a mf movie 😮
How could you love someone and learn to let them go 😢😢
Joyner never disappoints
All I can say is wow!!!🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We love you Jelly!!!  😘  This shits serious 🧐  I’m loving the vibes of this I needed this and now I have something to send to the ones I worry about 😊😢🎉
👍🏼
Lucas has his own lane in this rap scene!!!
Facts Joyner I relate hard to. This
Joyner has the best storytelling over every other rapper. Been a fan since day one. Ain’t nothing gonna change that. Because you have changed me. Inspired me. I’m glad to have you up on my wall. Because everytime I look at it I lk you got my back and i will never fucking fall.
this gives me "i'm sorry" vibes such a good song
Joyner really reminding us who’s at the top.these two were a dope collab. I pray this blows up huge
Jelly Roll! ✌🏼
This is some real shit!
Ayo for any one trapped in drug addiction i hope that you recover and find your way❤
Absolutely amazing
WOW...AMAZING MY BROTHERS
Bless Brother 🎉🔥👌
Jelly Roll was the perfect person to feature on this song.  I don't think people really realize that we are about to get the best Album of the Year so early in the year.  Joyner deserves ALL of the recognition! 👏🔥💯
I felt this so deep in my heart ....  💚joyner+jelly💚 another banger by 2 of the goats ... RIP JASE
Damn this hit home.... Great song...
😭😭😭😭
Man Joyner just is so great at telling story's an getting the message across man one of them ONES ☝🏾
Brilliant Joyner simply brilliant ❤
I can't find the words to express how incredible this song is. Start to finish. This hits in so many different ways.
Well damn that is a story a lot of are going through
BANGER!!
This man is one of the only real rappers of today. He deserves so much more praise. Keep doing your thing brother, you keep the love of Rap alive for me every time you drop something. ❤‍🔥🔥
🔥 🔥 I hope Jelly Roll jump on a verse for the remix
This one has me balling ...as someone whose loved an addict ...damn.
Coming from the same area as Joyner, drugs here has ruined alot of people's lives. My wife's  brother OD', had countless friends OD, and yet what has changed over the years? It's just gotten worse, but yet I'm still hopeful. Shining a light on this tragedy running rapid around this country is a good start, but it's just the start. Let keep pushing this narrative! Let's help those that need it, and let's remember...WE ARE ALL HUMAN! ❤ 🌎
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏
Joyner…… Massachusetts needed this one! If you know you know! Thank you!
This the OG joyner vibes we missed and needed
💥💥💥💥💥💥
Unfortunately addiction has pilfered through my family....... addiction is real
This that Joyner we needed again!!!
Ok ok 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🥺🥺🥺 between this banger,sorry, frozen, and the story about the white kid
To lyrically story tell is an art 🔥🔥
Yo love joyn but jelly so fake!
As an ex addict this song is intense and on point. Jesus did save me from myself and all my family stayed once I decided to stay also.
So how do we love? Do we just let them go?
My personal goat. Fxck drake and those other 2
Beautiful stuff, man!
REAL RAP🔥🔥
This really hits home lost my best friend to fentanyl and I'm so god damn mad he's gone ,he was doing so good and he let a girl screw with his head and he did it one last time 😢 fuck I'm balling ... This song is what everyone needs to hear ! This is real shit ! 🖤
not going to lie the auto tune isnt needed for jelly roll, it really through it off for me. regardless its a powerful song.
This is powerful ✊️ Awesome work Joyner👏 ❤
Been on both sides of this and two of my fav artists also the actor in this captured every essence of joyners second verse very powerful
Dag hits home
Not the auto tune man
Protect them at all costs. That is all.
Powerful tune brother. Coming from a 20year drug user just got clean 2 years ago!
Awesome message guys. I needed to see this.
I've struggled with addiction since I was 19 (37 now). I'm now 4 years sober. But it's a consistent battle. This song really hit me. Telling both sides of the struggle. The feelings of those watching someone they love destroy themselves. And the feelings of the addict struggling. Getting sober is the hardest thing I've ever done. But once you do it is one of the most fulfilling. For all those struggling, I know how hard it is. But if you're truly ready to stop and change, I promise you can do it!
💣💣💥💥🔂
Nice work
Jelly roll on this chorus👌 pristine pairing. Very deep message and well written.
I don't know how to compliment his music,  words aren't enough 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🙌🙌🙌
this is a masterpiece, fellas...  thank you..  lets run it up!
Goosebumps chills damn this is so deep 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾 I honestly think music 🎶 can heal the world 🌎 we just need more positive music 💯💯💯💯💯💯
3 months into 2024 and this is the best song I've heard yet
Powerful song. Love the message. How do you say "I can't be a part of your life bc of what you're doing" how to let go and understand it's on them...not you. Hard lesson
🔥🎶
Joyner is Steph Curry with dis shit, he can’t miss 💪🏿
Joyner is the best at rapping in multiple perspectives in a song
If i learned anything about joyner and doing features he's gonna have a message, and the song is gonna be good
whattt jelly and joyner!
Thank you for making this song
The opening hooked me immediately 😢 Lost my moms recently and this made me cry 😢
Love it ✨️😇🫠🥲🔥👍
This is actually the Joyner we missed, bro this is the vibez we missed
A collaboration that was needed
🙏🏻💘🙏🏻
S/O JELLY ROLL. #CA$HVILLE
"if you don't believe in yourself then you'll never believe in somebody believing in you"🔥
❤❤❤❤
As someone who just broke a LONG up and down xanax addiction, this song hits hard. Joyner and Jelly are so inspirational man. I hope I can meet you this year Jelly!
🥹,😢🙏💯❤️😉🌞😎
YES! I thought Joyner permanently turned to the trash rap that promotes thuggery,  but looks like he hasn't given up on the rap that will lift everyone up!
Wow 🔥🔥🔥
Jelly and Joyner bout to break the internet
Do NOT agree with his messaging. Addiction IS a disease. They do NOT want to be this way. Dont you think if they could just quit.. they would?!
It's the shoulder hair for me!
Amazing song. Only these two could make this work how it did. Love it
Great song but Remix this ASAP with a Jellyroll Verse!!!!
😢
This is a collab we didn't know we needed I hope they drop more music together
That last verse jeeeeze ...
This song will go down in history
Stick to rap your not a country singer
I didn’t expect that at all 🥺🥺 song of 2024 for fkn sure! The world needs to hear this daily
This is what a true rap is all about. Keep doing your doing Joyner!!
This shit was so deep 🔥🔥🔥🔥song
if you guys wanna hear the original sample used in this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbrISZ7MOQQ
Shit brought tears to my eyes and gave me chills. This hits home… this is the Joyner we’ve needed.  508 in the building 🖤
Joyner tell the deepest stories man. every song is book you don't want to stop reading. every song can be turned into a movie.
What a hit you and jelly roll is the man keep doing your thing pimp
RIP crimp. I love you.
Incredible
Real life 💯🔥
This song hits so hard and speaks on so many levels! 🥺 Thank you so much for speaking what most can't express! To all the people struggling with addiction you can over come it!
Amazing and  collaboration with jelly and joyner is absolutely beautiful

Happy to see Joyner is still able to make good music. Most of the recent have not been it, but this was some good shit.
Absolutely fire they outdid themselves on this track
That chorus... TREMENDOUS  🔥💯🔥
I got goosebumps listening to this !!
this has me in tears!  extremely powerful!
This is a masterpiece, if this doesn't win a Grammy we BOYCOTT !!!
Damn had to pull over,  my car caught on fire 🔥 🔥🔥

Ain't no way this want be a #1 song
Bro. Props. 🥺🙏🏾

jelly roll ,
Joyner blessed us with another issue that alot of people struggle with everyday. Jelly and Joyner well done guys
Fucking sell out bro 🔥🔥🔥
This is “DOPE” no pun intended
Wow my two biggest inspirations coming together! This is a masterpiece!
Pure talent thanks Joyner you never disappoint og
Yes Sir ...
Wow 😢❤. As a daughter of addicts this hit different thank you for this song
needed this
Jelly roll my fav artist hands down 🔥🔥🗣️
This hit home! My twin is a recovering heroine addict and that was the hardest shit to see her go through all that. She's 5 years clean now and I'm so damn proud of her for making the change
Liked Joyner since day 1 .. always been humble . People are really sleeping on him .
I think we all can relate or knows someone that can on both sides of this one, fire 🔥 for sure
Cool how he talked em both sides
This is super dope 🤙🏾🤙🏾 and now I’m a new fan of Jelly Roll his voice is amazing
doesnt joyner do lean...
Wonderful
grammy
This shit has me in full blown tears 😢
Beautiful song 💯 🎉brother
Love the song. I'm glad you finally dropped something I can rock with from the new album, I've hated the last few, just being 💯 honest..  REALLY would have loved a Jelly Roll verse, he'd a had a lot to say on this subject.  Something tells me THAT coming in the future, this was just a showcase.  GGs Joyner and JR. Got those I'm sorry, I'm not racist, your heart vibes here. That dichotomy of irl.
I truly feel this song. I  have been on both sides. Amazing song
This song❤
This what we need... story, message, motivation.
How is Joyner not more popular? Dude is a beast!
Joyner is goated for this...
wooow
Good Lord, this is painful.
Shit was fire
This needs more views..!  And from 2 of my favorites ❤.
This song is about to chart as well as change lives 🔥🙏🏽
We need to see a Jelly Roll and Eminem collab next!
Jesus Christ so jelly is a unreal singer ? I guess I didn’t know he was that good.
Fucking fire. Seen my own way out of my addiction with this song 💪🏻
The second verse is hard asf! 🔥🔥🔥🔥 if u battling any form of addiction I pray your strength 🙏
Hits Different at Midnight....damn, who's cutting Onions 😢
Joyner keeps calm, that's why he keeps Killin with his flow...🖤
Absolutely Amazing ! 👏 It was all great but bruh went off on the 2nd verse. That shit touched my soul in a weird way. I applaud you all. JELLY, saw the pain in your eyes. Vocals brought the whole thing to the map ! Love this song !
Got me in my feelings right now man, I just overcome a one year addiction, I'm three weeks clean now.
It's sad. They don't want to act that way. Nobody wants to act like a scumbag. If they don't want the help, they'll never get it. If you're strong enough to survive, you come out on the other side a f*cking BEAST. Spread LOVE no matter what! Thats what addicts need. Don't give up until you have to. For 2 years straight, I tried to save my best friend of 35 years from dying from alcoholism. I found him, dead. Sickening. At least I never gave up. And, for that, I can hold my head up high. Peace n' LOVE. Dow
Let's not forget about jellyrool ...hell of a melody  .great song !
Amazing 👏👏👏👏👏 powerful
🐢🐢💎💎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 #LFGOOO
🫡🫡🫡🫡
This is legendary.
I love it..! Joyner never disappoints, this song hard
Wow yo that's 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why did you autotune Jelly Roll?
My older brother struggled with addiction for most of my life. Tore our family apart in many ways. Luckily he is doing a lot better now but this really hit me hard and it’s honestly one of the best songs I’ve ever heard. Joyner is an absolute genius when he writes like this.
this one for u chance i miss u bro RIP 😢😢😢😖
Hits hard since I’ve been in both sides of the shoe in this song.
nailed it once again. thank you for that 🙏
Best release of the year by far  Om going through it like the rest of us THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart  I relate to you a lot and  AGAIN  THANK YOU FOR YOUR MUSIC  STAY STRONG WERE ALL here for a reason
This ❤💥💥💥💥🎯
This is JOYNER FUCKING LUCAS 😲👏👏👏
My big brother is currently battling with drug addiction. This song 🎵  cuts deep. 😢
Joyner is legendary
ddiction. The word itself carries weight—a black hole that swallows hope, leaving behind only echoes of what once was. It is the siren’s call, the seductive whisper promising relief. And yet, it is also the abyss that consumes, leaving shattered lives in its wake.  Honesty. Here lies the heart of it all. To peel back the layers, to reveal the raw nerve beneath. This portrayal does not flinch; it does not avert its gaze. It says, “Look. See. Understand.” And perhaps, in that stark illumination, there lies redemption.  So we stand here, at the crossroads, memories swirling like autumn leaves. The past whispers, the present beckons. And we choose—to fight, to heal, to reclaim what was lost. For in this honest portrayal, we find not condemnation but communion. We are not alone in our struggle; we are part of a vast, flawed, beautiful tapestry of humanity.
This hit the heart 4 real🙌🔥
This is music with a meaning. Respect to anyone still actively struggling in addiction. 7 years clean, just know there is a better way and you can do it too!
This song hits me hard!! I struggled with addiction for years and I can definitely see it from both points of view. I cried listening to this! #recoveryispossible
Omgggg…… this song hits fuckingggg hard man. 😭😭😭😭 Jelly you never disappoint in anything you’re on. Joyner your words are so relatable.
I needed this ❤
This is outta this world fire. As someone who's been on both sides of that battle, this is powerful and love the message and multiple perspectives.  100/100 message. Been clean since 2016 and completely turned my situation around. Lost way too many best friends to this battle, it's not even funny.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Haven't talked to my best friend of 30 years in 2 years because of addiction. This is IT 😢❤ Its ok to step away
RESPECT
So dope...never heard jelly sing like that
So awesome!!! 🔥 This hits deep, I'm an ex 24 opioid addict, 7 yrs clean now, thank y'all for existing and making great music and being a voice for us who ain't heard! Much luv from BAMA baby!!!

More rehab music I'm not a junkie so slow shit music to me
Get em jelly!!! 💪
Wow this hits home 💖
Bro, I listen to all your music, have since day 1. You never cease to amaze me. You are underrated and overlooked. To me your top 5 all time. But this track speaks into my life directly. I've struggled with addiction since 2002 in and out of Rehab and prison ( mostly prison). I finally am free of the shackles of that poison, I found God and found my purpose. I am a musician as well and am trying to make a change on the way the industry glorifies a lifestyle that keeps people like me oppressed. I also am actively working on my recovery as well as getting my certifications so I can help others still trapped in the struggle. Thank you for this song and all you do. You have no idea the impact q positive message can have on the world, keep em coming and never compromise what makes you you! Your brother in arms 👻
Been fighting addiction since the age of 12. Now I'm 45. Just celebrated 9 months! Had 3 1/2 years until last April 7th. Made the biggest mistake of my life. Cost me everything; my wife, career; almost my life! But, I didn't give up. I won't become a statistic!
What a beautiful song 😢
Wow 💔 2 years ✨💪
Storytelling like this is a lost art in today’s rap industry & hip hop. God bless Joyner & Jelly!🙏
The collab of a lifetime!
This song outta here!!!
💯
This song just hits the ❤..  Yall both two amazing talented artist.. I would love to see yall come together & make more!  Cause this song is going to touch a lot of people!  & hopefully pull them up outta that rut. truly a amazing song i hope to see more from the two of you!

Has Joyner ever put out a song that wasn’t a banger or touching?  Not one bad song from this dude
2:41 the best part!!💯🔥🔥 #REAL😢
This song is one of those instant classics.
I’m 28, and 13 days from being 365 days clean and sober for the first time in 17 years.. I’ve overdosed and actually been pronounced dead.. more than once😔 but I’m finally doing it and this song is so spot on I broke all the way down. But I got this! and so do the rest of you fighting this horrible DISEASE❤️‍🩹

Great song performed by two real artists. Keep making music that is hit home for so many.
Nice, Jelly shoulda snuck a verse in there, his own song "Addiction Kills" was so well done and similar.
Thank you for making a song that will help people and inspire 🙏🏻 Jelly is a perfect fit for the song as well.
Rip Moe 🕊️ 😢❤❤❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Chills bro!! Grammy 🔥 🔥 🔥 LOVE  IT!!

The story telling. Literal goosebumps. Jelly was perfect for this as well.
Thanks Joyner.
thank you
Im okey my G  smokin vibez one love yah bless " FROM THE LION THUGA
GOAT
Joyner top 5 🐐 this is phenomenal
Another joyner classic
Classic Joyner coming through with the storytelling and song writing from both perspectives.
One word  Goosebumps 🖤
This is the type of music people need to hear!
How you gonna credit the food catering company but not give credit to Mike Belaire for acting in your video? 🤨
Joyner lucas mastered this art of duality. And this is his trade mark the only way to define and differentiate him from other industrial rappers. Seeing what he did on am not racist, forever, ross cappuccino, am sorry, broski etc. The niggah is impressive
Amen.
On repeat until I get every single word. Thank you, Joyner.
That’s my pops ❤️❤️
This album will be another version of 508. 🔥
This song spoke to my soul... This why Joyner a fkn goat.. The visuals and message is always on point and hits close to home. Listened to this on audio and didn't even realize it was Jelly roll. THIS JOYNERS YEAR! FACTTTTS!
ross Capicchioni flash backs
Shit,hit home. Hard n da pain,paint
They don’t know yet but they single handily dropped the best song I’ve ever heard. I’ve seen and lived this from both sides. Bless you both for bringing everyone’s feelings out of them and giving some understanding from both sides.
Legendary🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐊💯🇯🇲
This hits so hard I'm n tears beautiful
Bro this jelly roll is a completely different person. I know him from his 10 minute freestyle
This song hits deep as an addict(sober) but will always be an addict..* I have family and friends that i have hurt. And that starts to hurt more than the withdrawal.. Addicts withdrawal.. Families withdrawal.. Friends withdrawal.. Thats the withdrawal that ends up getting you to stop..The mental withdrawal.. The physical withdrawal isnt enough.. If the physical agony of a drug kick was enough.. More addicts would be clean alot sooner.  Its the other stuff that gets you to finally give in
I want to see Jelly Roll fuckin EVERYWHERE this year! I wanna see him in rap, and R&B, his sound is so great for other genre’s besides country. He’s so talented, and he pairs so well with the intricacy of Joyner’s music. Keep rocking gents🤙🏼
The best in the fkn industry. We need more songs like this ❤ real life shyt
Deepest fuckin song I've ever heard! I can't wait to bump the album tomorrow
these are joyners best songs
Great song 🎵 💯🐐
Bonus points for the Rammstein Tee
Ohhh I've been waiting for this collaboration!!
Bro you a legend, you don't make music you make food for the soul👌
Reality is that You can't see life through anyone's eyes, but your own.   This one hit deep 😔
Joyner is the best right now. Every song hits and has meaning. He's the best of my era!
Please add a Jelly Roll verse on this!!!
Wow, what an incredible song, touches so hard on an addicts thoughts!!
😳😭
Damn I needed to hear this, beautiful song
I CANT WAIT FOR THE ALBUM!
Joyner and Jelly? Lets go!🔥🔥
Love when Joyner gets into his story telling bag showing both sides of the perspective (Im not a Raci$t, Ross Capicchioni).  Another banger here.
your music hits me different these days . brings up so much emotion.
Banger
The fact jelly didn't spit a verse is very disappointing
Got damn.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Here before a million entry 👍
powerful
Man can't lie I've been battling addiction for a long time now. Ever since i got out of the Army. This shit hits deep.
Amazing!!! 🙌🙌🙏🙏
Rip Anthony. This song hit hard and I mean HARD.

Great track👏
Joyner and jelly ....this is incredible need more songs  together
He stole this video from ASAP Preach - Now I Know.  (Christian rapper) You aint slick Joynèr we see you!
Rapping from 2 different perspectives❤‍🔥❤‍🔥real definition of a storyteller💌❤
Its hard to let them go. They choose the addiction over you, so let them go. There's nothing you can do. They have to want to change and then do it.
This is a masterpiece
dog this shit is so powerful I am near tears
Im 37 yrs old my mom been on drugs all 37 yrs of my life. Song just hits different
Now that Jellyroll is mainstream everyone wants a piece, where was yall 10 years ago!??
15 months sober. Addiction is a disease. But it’s the only disease you can keep in check by taking action.
As an addiction counselor, I will be using this song. True talent J. L
Deep song
Raise your hand if you got over your addiction ❤  Keep your head up everyone
Would have loved to hear Jelly on a real verse.  I know drug topic is something he's passionate about
Cheese on bread Joyner, the creativity in these songs are next level!
Fire
Just a gorgeously made video and a masterpiece of a song. I love an miss my sisters. So much.
Jelly roll sucks
Nobody can top Joyners message his delivery is always so on point another banger
Everyone in the world can relate to this song very true and hurtful lyrics powerful song💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿
First time hearing Jelly, not a fan of that voice but Joyner killed it again!!
Holy shit what a rollercoaster of emotions!
Joyner n Jelly oh hell yeah
Wow, just wow…opened YouTube to see this collab. 🔥
”I hope you look in the mirror and see all the things I’ve been seeing in you“  ”If you don’t believe in yourself than you’ll never believe in somebody believing in you“   Joyner isn’t just a rapper he’s a poet… theirs levels to his music
Put some respeck on this man’s name! Joyner I want to thank personally thank you for going back to the drawing board on this project. Also 6/23/19 I got sober with Mac, Em, NF, and Joyner soundtracking my journey through the hard times. Recovery is possible…I’m living proof! ✌🏽
As someone who has a family history of addiction, and realizes the addiction in their own personality. This hits so many lvls . God bless anyone who is battling addiction of any kind, there are people out there who love you. God bless
🎵💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥
JOYNER!!!!!!!!❤
508 ✌🏻
Such a beautiful song🔥🔥
This is the one that'll be engraved in my soul.

this shit hits hard. 3 of my closest friends are dead from overdoses., many more have been cut off including family members, I just can't do it anymore, attending these funerals hurt man. so here I am alone no friends, just music and gaming as my copium. Shit sucks.
Hiphop misses music & visuals like this… Em & Rihanna Wiz & Charlie Puth  Big Sean one man can change the world, Pac Dear Mama, Diddy missing you
JOYNER IS THE GOAT, THIS IS A BANGER
✌🦾🚨🚒
Song of 2024
.
Good lord!!! Thank you both
Amazing. Joyner is a great story teller❤
Wow. Just wow. That was some powerful stuff!
Wow.. this song hit home! Touched so many people with this. Love this song. Crazy how much can relate to this. Addiction is a disease that many people know of and have in their families.
The album is going to be fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is the best use of Jelly’s talent he’d be the hook 🐐 rn easily
Joyner consistently releases hard-hitting, incredible music! Legendary stuff.
Amazing 👏
♥🔥
Should make two of them wings (one in each line up) the bomb wings. The bomb russian roulette simultaneously- would make this show an instant classic, no doubt!
Lost my sister to addiction. Although she’s still alive I haven’t been able to see or talk to her for almost 10 years
My niece who left 2 kids behind and my former student who was like my son. He went from being a kid with no ambition to an actor.   When they left, it really hurt me. I wish my love was stronger than drugs.
This is Joyner’s speciality. Great storytelling and always telling both sides. Great job Joyner.
😭🥹🥺🔥😍 All the emotions!
This shit hit harder than a bat to the mouth
Made me cry the first time that I've heard this song and now it's on repeat. I can relate to this song. This song real 💯 🕊️

For real, this song hits home very hard, had my tearing up too, def one of the best duos I can remember in the past 15 yrs or so. 🔥 song

Damn, was really hoping for a jelly verse... Still good shit
As a former meth addict of almost 4 years, after moving states away, deleting people out of my phone, life, and memories, I can proudly say I have been clean for a year and a half and I got no plans to ever go back to the hell that surrounded my life in those bad years. I promise you, if you want it, it can happen. God bless you and God bless you for making this song Joyner
POWER COLAB

The collab we didn’t kno we needed… RUN UP THEM VIEWS!!!! 💯🔥👊🏼

Yk everybody gon relate lbs
I love these kinds of songs n videos from Joyner
Joyner is my all time favorite artist every song relates to me and he displays it perfectly in his lyrics and videos. After Experiencing trauma suicide loss addiction loyalty and trust broken grew up in a single parent household sitting back and watching generational mess and chaos in this civilisation. His music touches deep in my soul. I love you joyner youre not just an artist you're heaven sent. ❤
This is incredible
Win love this for real this will help the world 🌍 for sure
Joyner is not appreciated enough.
This song's so powerful 🔥🔥 To everyone going through it & their families ✌

Some of the realest shxt ever recorded. There levels to this shxt n these 2 men are conquering them all✔️✔️👌🏻🖤🤍
Literally dealing with this situation right now 😢
I've been an addict for 10 million years, I lost my mom, who had  a son and my new brother at the same time (and said, it wasn't mine) but this song saved my great grandson in 2049 and his whole generation. This means alot.
They didt GAIN
Holy fkn sht ......
masterpiece
when i was at my lowest, the mothers of my kids made a choice to cut me off because they felt it was best for them and the kids mental safety. ive since grown a whole awful lot and like to believe im not at all like i used to be but i still have to accept that it was my fault that i pushed them away and lost what i didnt realize would be the most important thing ever to me. this song helps me find peace with it. if only they could meet me now ya know
This has gotta be a hit, Real Talk this song hits hard💯
A collab I never expected to see or sound so fire
Amazing song, this will touch so many people. Wish Jelly had a verse on this, you know it would have been deep.
🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
Can't wait for the album It's been a while.
Just wow.. 😦
Ouch, this hits hard..
Joyner and jelly roll, this this amazing. Really. Gave me chills thru my whole body. Insane. Much love dawg and God bless.
🔥🔥THIS IS TOO GOOD🔥🔥 It’s also because it hits soo close to home…

I LOVE that he’s wearing rock band shirts! Legends and this message is outta this world.
Lucas been my Fave Rapper
❤❤
to put jelly on a song that you rap on and not let him rap is crazy to me lol
Made me cried 😢 half my friends died from addiction
I appreciate Joyner for showing the other side of Addiction besides just the people it impacts but the person behind the substance abuse who wants to change but is suffering from addiction. Knowing it hurts themselves and turns them into something they don't even want to be on top of hurting everyone else.
This was deep on so many levels. Glad I made it out the other side. This was incredibly written
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Beautiful song guys 💯🔥
Bruh, Joyner does it again, he's def top 3 out today
Damn Man….i hate how his songs just hit the heart man from both sides.
This one hits home for me! 🔥🔥
My best friend is not the same man I grew up with and this song made me just broooooooo 😢😢😢😢😢
Joyner, we talked back in 2015 You told me “Don’t Stop and grind hard kid, don’t take no for an answer and kick them doors down & go hard” I’m back to tell you that’s what I’ve done. I see you touring rn & I want to join you.  PS: The new song is great. Didn’t know Jelly sang like that & your verses were fire as always.
Joyner always finds a way to strike your soul.
Man they fuckin crushed this. Joyner back in his bag for this one. Jelly just stay killin it recently. Love this.

Joyner is who he thinks he is🔥🔥all the way from South Ah 🇿🇦
Lost my son about a year and a half ago to addiction.  I can't even describe everything we went through and the loss.  Love you Josh, man I wish things turned out different.  You at least always knew where you stood with me.  I didnt agree with what you was doin, but I loved you even through it...
2024 song of the Year! Hands down. Amazing artistry here. Thank you
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ye broh ❤❤ that's what am talking bout broskie
This gives me a " I'm sorry " pt 2 type vibes.. ima take a shot to this but this bottle is my problem
Holy s*** this is definitely the best song I've heard in a long time
🎉
How can you love someone and learn to let them go ? How can we fall apart on things we'll never know ?
🔥🔥🔥
As someone whose made it through fentanyl addiction, these words are so fucking powerful..
Jelly Roll's shit sounds ridiculous and is hella cringe, but as always, Joyner killed it.
Oh shit
Joyner is still the best storyteller in the game man.
Every single available from his new album early is absolutely phenomenal.  I’m so pumped for Friday to hear the rest.  Joyner so far above and beyond all these other rappers these days
Joyner's pen game, explicit lyrics, meaningful storytelling is what separates him from most rappers 🔥
I relate to this song alot not me addicted but family members but 🔥🔥 song
Just heard this for the first time and instantly fell in love with it. This is what I call deeper than rap, you killed this bro. Shout out to all the people who can relate to this track, I know I sure can.
Wow I'm lost for words this hits home hard
This is crucial...Joyner is the truth. Jellyroll was a perfect fit...Dope song about  addiction
Sorry pt2
the music video really put the verses into perspective for me, and after seeing it i felt the song a lot deeper, i kinda felt like i was the one talking to you through the dude. appreciate this one.
This is the music the world needs! You 2 snapped on this one! 💯
Yea....this is amazing.
Good ass song❤❤❤
Crying now

Wow Amazing ❤️🔥
Joyner is truly one of the goats in story telling rap….so talented 🔥🔥
Joyner at his peak is storyteller mode
Ain't no way ❤😮😭
Joyner till this day had a way of connecting his words to visuals in a manner that give me chills every fuckin time. His vision for these songs and the visuals behind them leave me absolutely speechless at times. It truly gives the song a whole different feel. I heard this song yesterday and could not wait for this visual. My boy jelly did his too what a beautiful vocal for this project. Everything was done so good. Thank yall for makin this one 💪🔥
Joyner musics heal the soul you can't escape! #JoynerWorld!
Bruh this is fire🔥🔥   "How can you love someone and learn to let them go?" 🔥🔥
The way Lucas gives all perspectives of the story is absolutely genius
That auto tune is CRAZY 🤣
Been clean for 8 yrs from heroin and pills thank you for music like this and MY MOM BEAT BREAST CANCER ITS BEEN HARD FOR US BUT THANK GOD FOR YOUR MUSIC TO GET ME THROUGH MONEY SO TIGHT I FEEL LIKE GOVING UP SOME DAYS THIS WILL HELP 💯

Joyner is an amazing artist. The guys Knows and talk about common problems in a way that touches everyone.   Joyner Lucas much love for u bro. Keep going God bless u.
It hits hard when the actor knows the lines like that!!! Sheesh i felt this in my soul! Im in recovery from those pain pills, its been a long time so long i feel like a completely different human, I think completely different than the guy I used to be in fact that guy was a moron. Im happy and blessed to be where Im at, from NY state prison to a business owner in south mississippi. If I can do it anybody can, i was a super scumbag.
I work in behavioral health and detox , this song touches me in a way I can't explain . Thanks for the motivation to keep going as addiction is a hard disease and many loose the fight . If your fighting and still hanging on you got this
The collabo the world needed. Healing.
'your addiction has altered your mind'

*"If you don't believe in yourself, you will never believe that somebody's believing in you!"*
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I have been a fan of yours since I’m not raciest and I am a recovering addicted my self and this has brought tears to my eyes 😢❤ thank you Joyner for this your helping another soul for real fam!
Don't destroy yourselves homies. You are loved.
🔥❤‍🔥🔥
"If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believin' in you"  Hits deep.
Keep doing what you doing bro 💯
This has the potential to change the world, time and connections all together
Meh.. would’ve rather had Jelly rapping but, I guess he’s not doing that anymore. Just an overly auto tuned chorus. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Overall good message and solid on Joyners part.
Wow exactly what our fam is going thru 😢
Deeper.
❤❤
Hands down when he said people call it an addiction but addicts use that as a way to still do it. And make it seem right! #joshuahyle #joshlove
Since the day his wife let it slip I've been waiting for this song. Surpassed all my expectations 2 of the best and 2 of my favorite and rapping about literally my entire life. How crazy.
This made Me CRY the first 30sec how powerful music CAN BE!
I love when Joyner get real like this.
Such a powerful message, the world we know these days is filled with too much addiction and people are lost because of it I pray they find peace and a way to stand up to there demands because there lives are worth so much more than the drugs they put into there bodies
This song hits so hard I had to replay it. I feel it in my soul.
Joyner Lucas is leadership🎉
Wow this is incredible. I don't know what to say I'm truly speechless. I've been sober a year and two months off meth and fentanyl and this makes me so sad to watch yet so proud of the steps I've made. Thank you for the incredible visuals.
In the last decade, there was Kendrick Llamar, and for a few years, Joyner Lucas is welcome to the 🐐 club
This is why Joyner is my favourite artist of this generation , there’s not many artists that release music that I go back and listen to . The legends in the game I wanna show my kids one day and Joyner is definitely one of them . The realest
Around killer video and a fire song keep up the good work joyner
I'm not crying 😢... your crying 😢 😭
This one hurts...😢
I can relate to every side and word to this song..knowing many addicts and being a recovering addict myself. Great duo and even greater song & message ❤
Brilliant.

Woahhhhhhh whaaaaatttttttttttt!!!!! The collab we needed! Let's gooooooo!
This hits hard.
this is a great track Joyner Lucas truly never disappoints 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Been listening to this song on repeat all morning and crying. As a recovering addict (9 yrs clean this May) & also someone who grew up with a parent who was a addict for most of my younger years, this song hit HARD. Hearing both perspectives in this song is just ..
I made a video explaining that Joyner is a musical genius after he released "I'm not racist " he has put the whole world on notice and since I first heard him he consistently gets better and better.
Another hit. I need more of these two.  Joyner works with everybody.
🔥🔥
Fuuuuuuckk. Bruh you cane at a wild time with this. I'm still in my early 20s and one of my bois since middle got hooked on the percs. Ae stopped hearing from him and we all thought it was the usual dip for a while come back but that man was in the struggle. We all tried to talk to him but he wasnt having it. He just contacted us and he say hes doin better but we dont know how long that'll last especially since we tried to get him clean once.
I'm in tears with how beautiful and real this song is.😢😢❤❤
Beautiful
Amazing!!! Can we please get a remix with a verse from Jelly?
best of joyner lucas and jelly roll 👌 🙌 ❤ stay true
❤❤❤
Joyner, here are your flowers 💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
Damn I miss hearing hip hop like this. Got that Beanie Sigel “Feel It In The Air” vibe
Love the song.. but the only difference is know you want The peace... you forgot I was the peace..😢😢😢😢.. never will change if it's not for my peace.. respect the peace of the peace of peace... still winning
My goddddd this storytelling makes me cry tears of understanding what my thinks when she does drugs…but drugs is not a good coping mechanism unless you want to fall deeper in a hole 4:24
I love this collaboration and this song is one deep and hits on thing's people don't wanna hear!!!🎵
Holy shit
Amazing !!!!!
This is the collab we needed to see!
Love this!!!!
Love to Joyner and Jelly but man huge congrats to the actor for playing it so well. You really can see the soul he put in his performance lip synking Joyner's lyrics. Congrats again.
Bro did it again, blessed us with pure art
was a pleasure working with everyone on such an important project! 🤍
Song is a masterpiece already, and the Jelly Roll collab is just bonus points
This shit had me in tears 💯 no shame
powerful, blessings to those fighting  with their addictive nature
Another masterpiece. Thank you Joyner ❤
You know it's gonna hit when joyner has a fat white guy in the video
Wow, fuckin speechless
This is another masterpiece beautiful
Powerful song man
Glad to see Dane Cook is still acting.
awesome!
How can you love someone. And learn to let them go. Damn that’s deep 💯💯
Joyner makes an impact. Keep it up, God Bless!
I felt the emotion that connect to my own personal life and loss I’ve felt. The lyrics really cut deep into my mind. #addictionthedisease

Amazing jelly vocals on this one!
Joyner Lucas is better than most on packing lyrics in line.

Joyner is so tough man. Love his storytelling. Doesn't get any better than him right now
Thank you guys.
❤❤❤😢
This is life changing track Joyner. Thanks man
I truly understand both 😢sides i have been mostly clean for 4 years and my best friend is 2 years clean....and I wasn't there when she was drowning and I didn't see the meth .... and then she was in so much trouble with  everyone and 😢i couldn't see it ...I  still wish I could have saved her like she did me ...we both shouldn't be here just like uncle Jimmy  but we are and we're always going to have to try and just keep swimming and not drown today ❤
This one hits on so many different levels. Another banger from Joyner and Jelly
This is powerful.
This man never miss!! God bless anyone dealing with addiction!!

Jelly hitting a whole different key here. I wanna see more collaborative collab in the future.
I may not know who you are and you may not know who I am, but I sincerely pray that whatever addiction you're struggling with, I truly hope that you will overcome it. And the best way I know to overcome it is by giving yourself to Christ 🙏🏾❤ Stay safe out there y'all
i don't have drug addiction but the other addiction this still hit hard
Was definitely not expecting this collaboration
*RIP to the ones addiction took from us all way too early* 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
i love when MUSIC fight against this SHIT, THANK YOU Joyner Lucas
The perfect collab! This is deep af! So much talent in one song! I couldn't help but to just cry! Both of these artists are story tellers in their own right and continue to show their greatness with each song they drop! Together they've created a hit and I can't wait to see it blow up!
Beautiful song 🔥
Still fighting my way out of this same rut, been clean for a few months now with no outside help. Finally waking up and realizing this isn't happiness 💯 stay strong everyone! Love yourself as much as you "love" anything else you put before your own happiness and mental peace
Jelly killed that hook
The perspectives are intense. Prayers to anyone going through it. You must go into the fire and fight, then and only then will you CHANGE
How timely for me man😞. Thanks Joyner and that guy🔥 Doubles up how I fvck with yo music💯
Thank you for being one of few who actually care
I'm literally in tears fighting for my life, I know no-one I know will see this but I battling with Bipolar and a drug addiction and lost every single single that important to me. I know I need help but no one is willing to help cos everyone has given up on me.
Wow
Let’s go baby’s go jelly never disappoint 5 years sober this year #wedorecover
I'm a simple man, I see Joyner I press like button
I just love this side of Joyner
🔥
Truly incredible bro.
I think today is the day i pass on tell my kids im sorry
Strong ,, very very strong,  hats off to you boys,  shits ruined my family multiple times and living in southeast Tennessee I've watched it ruin and kill just about everyone I know.. great song great message,,, needs to be said far more..
This song is everything 🥺🥹🥰
thanks for blessing my ears today joyner ❤
🔥
🔥🔥🔥 view from the teller and the listeners story. A song to reach hearts who need it in the harsh reality we live in.
Joyner
I love when Joyner tells a story from different perspectives. Every single one is 🔥
Joyner is one of the best storytellers ever!!!
As a daughter of a mother who’s done horrible things to me to feed her addiction a father who’s a alcoholic, this song hurts and makes me call out to God to help me forgive and heal, they did amazing on this one. The way they show the man thinking through addiction in the second part is real, they may not think they are doing wrong and don’t understand how bad things are with what they are doing, the way they show both sides is beautiful. Iv been working on my path with God and I feel called to by God with this song. I just wanna say thank you
18 months sober. Four friends (that were like brothers to me) I was in recovery with. I had to step away from them because they didn't want to put the work in. Two died and two relapsed and are still out. When Joyner said at 1:38   "Much as I need you, I will not be stickin' around or watchin' you rest in peace I promise, I love you, but I gotta do what's best for me"  This shit hit so hard 😢
“How come you’re only there for me when I’m trying to get clean?” Is a bar that hit me right in the heart. Joyner don’t miss with the storytelling.
Please tell me this man wasn't forced to use autotune with a voice a s good as it is plain. Really hope he isn't getting T-pained
Fire 🔥 ❤
That chorus goes hard as fuck. Probably one of the hardest lines from any song I’ve heard in a while.   “How can you call it love if you have to ask if they’ll stay”
This was deep
This is a complete waste of having Jelly on the track. Doesn't sound right.
This song really hit close to my heart. Great song guys ❤️‍🔥
This is already a classic.
Joyner as usual delivers, one of the best rappers out there, glad he’s still with us 🙏❤
I love Joyner ❤
😮😢❤
Zawszę na wysokim poziomie . Pozdro !
🔥🔥
JOYNER NEVER DISSAPOINTS 🔥🔥🔥 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦 Have Always been a fan ❤️🌹🔥
💯💯💯 yo Joyner, I wanna see a crazy joint with dax and trippie redd 🙏🏿💯
😢 I love this video and song
This is the Joyner I love
FINALLY !
2 of my faves!! ❤❤❤
Truly moving, thank you to everyone involved in creating this emotional masterpiece
I just got out of rehab today so I consider this video a BLESSING. I needed this!!!
Mm🙌
Here for Joyner fuck jelly roll.
Perspective is everything! We lose site of that when we want what we think is best for others.. I've been on both ends of this. I really like how Joyner puts both sides of the coin in his music.
Yo!!!  This wreaked me.  Shout to Joyner Lucas & Jelly Roll
This song hits home, #wedorecover
NUEVA VIDA EL ÚLTIMO 👼7💯👑⚖️🗡️🦁🕊️😇👁️⭐🌞😶‍🌫️🌬️⛈️❤️‍🔥💙🧬💖🌎🌝🌀✨☕👆😎

That shady feature will hit like crack
2 of my favorite artist on one track. Amazing.
2024 NEEDED THIS🔥💪💯
Another amazing song that shows both sides perspective in difficult situations.  Joyner is trying to highlight what a lot of people cant do anymore.  Walk in someone else’s shoes…

“Wipes tears” the things I gotta do best for me
My heart felt this. You made my eyes water. String down my face. Be strong please ❤ listen. Addiction is hard. You are always better then the drugs and alcohol. Be strong like we all know you can be. Not for yourself but for the love of our children.
🔥🔥🔥
This is what we need Joyner!!!
Just subscribed to him ❤️. Thank you Jelly for sending me over.
Hell yea boy got Jelly to do the hook 2 of my favorite artist on the same track I fucking love both y’all keep doing ya thang
This song is so heavy.  People who battle addiction, whether they are currently losing or winning the fight,  should really feel the heaviness.  This song is really incredible.
This album is about to slap 😮‍💨
and speaking of god how the fuck do you know all the plans he gotten for me / take me as i am or let me be tired of you stressing me cause shit i gotta do is best for me  😖

My heart 🥺
This song hit so deep 😢10/10  Four days for the album to be released 💊✨🎧 I won't hesitate to download it  Love you joyner I'm your biggest fan Billy from Africa 🇿🇲
Bro if jelly got his own verse. This song would be even better then it already is
Words can't describe how much I feel this. Thank you Joyner, for speaking on watching a loved one struggle with addiction 🙏🏽
This song made me weep . Joyner and Jelly helped me realize I need to make a change .
Dam joyner......u never disappoint my boii 🔥🔥🔥
This one hits hard, in the current situation of my life. Thank you Joyner!
Jelly roll cant sing
Joyner, my guy, drop the album bruh. I'm ready to give you my money.
This is true and real music ❤️
Joyner is a cheat code, simple as that.
No1 is better at telling the story on both perspectives than Joyner! Well done my Boi.
Is it really love if you have to beg them to stay??.... ,shit hit harder than me dropping my last spliff 😂
Great song, tear-jerker.
Wow. Very convicting, we think it’s easier to push away the addict in our life. But what really I need to do is to find a way to love them.
Damn this is exactly what I'm feeling today. Stop blaming me for faults of crap I can't do shit without u trying to stop me to blame.or.dismiss.the underlying problems get left behind
This is fucking crazyyyyy . This is old Joyner that made us all preach he was the best 🔥🔥
Instant download
If you don't believe in yourself,you'll never believe in somebody who believes in you ❤❤
This is the collaboration I’ve been waiting for!,

This shit hit my soul.
😭🔥
Yessssssssss!!!! This WORLD 🌎 needed this legendary collaboration!!
People want to glorify the songs about the drugs and partying, but when real shit like this comes out people don’t really listen. Joyner and Jelly Roll, y’all did a big 1 with this song ❤️ Thank you both.
I can feel the pain shown by the actor in the video. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Now your only missing the callab with NF and you'll be one of the best I seen in a minute

Hot off the press Joyner ❤❤❤
Joyner GOAT of story telling
Hell yeah!

TREMENDOUS
So dope that you hooked up with jelly
golden combo
Such a Knockout Combo! Nice Work Brothers and all involved!🦾💎🏆
Damn this is powerful 😩😩😩
You're always the "best for us" sir 🔥🔥
This is the strongest song I've heatd in a long time
Song is meh. Video's cringe. Jelly Roll looks hella awkward everytime the camera cuts to him, makes this whole thing downright laughable
Joyner deserves at least 3 grammys
Good to see Joyner Lucas again! I feel like he fell off the map!
My moms addicted to pills and fuck I wish she would listen to this shit
Damn storytelling Joyner is back, I'm so excited and hyped for the album to finally drop on Friday 🔥🔥Joyner Season
I've never clicked on something so fast in my life. Two legends in the making.
Jelly let Joyner ruin his authentic raw voice with auto tune
JOYNER FOR PRESIDENT
Joyner fucking Lucas🔥
Just, fuckkkk
Nah bro you’re him!!!!
First off let me say….unexpected…I love this collab and I promise I’m commenting before listening. The video is on pause
You know it’s good music when you get the chills 🥺🫰🏻
🔥 as always from Joyner!
😊🏝🏖🏝
Absolute cold chills listening to this!! I've delt with this my whole life!
Joyner is hands down my favorite artist. Bro your lyrics and visuals never miss! Your content is extremely versatile and visceral. Keep building your legacy homie 💐💪🏾✊🏾
Never thought I want a jelly roll and joyner collabe but I'm glad it's a thing now ❤❤❤❤, been a fa if joyner since I'm not racist dropped and a fan if jelly roll way before need a favor, the rest is history
Not abuse.. and being a POS.
thank you so much for this.
The Busey connection!
I received a phonecall late last year which i ignored and two weeks ago i replied to her message an her mother replied telling me she had died and it broke me into two because we have been so close for so many years, we found each other through my music as she was from america and i am in Australia and she believed in me and help me get sober and when i told her i was sober she was so proud of me and today i am 3 years clean and sober and i miss her so much and she LOVED Jelly Roll she was in one of his old music videos...
This song should be sold in pharmacies coz it's a pain killer
Addiction is a symptom of an undiagnosed issue.... please be patient... love love love
Lost my brother in 2019 to overdose. This hit my soul 💔
#downtownfvmilyy
Joyner talking about everything no other rapper wants to be a part of. The real shit.
Wow.. this touches home. From myself being the addict to turning around when my daughter was born 9 years ago...to getting full custody of my daughter &now waking up everyday for the last 2 years wondering if that's the day I'll get the dreaded call&need to explain to my daughter that her mom is no longer with us. Shits ugly out there....but it can be done. YOU just need to be the 1 that wants it
Joyner is dope as always.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Don’t let him go back for those pills in the sink tho 😢 yall wasn’t low
His voice doesn't match his body...
This is the one! Thank you Joyner
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
brought a tear to my eye

At the moment I am fighting with drug addiction and it is hard
This song gives me absolute chills 😭
🔥🔥🔥
🙌🏾🥺
Holy shit I thought theses two weren't going to make a song together, but they did
Joyner lucas has evolved into a world wide relatable inspiration 🎉 #RESPECT
Joyner rapping two different perspectives is a cheat code. Chills
I feel like the addict in this song... #tears
Everyone callin' that shit a disease and makin' you feel like you in the right But I hate the fact that you really be usin' that as an excuse to do what you like  Damn.... Love the call out!
Legends ForReaLGangHer3!!
Joyner is him deep message
This song is crazy because this is the best song I’ve heard IN A LONG TIME
dope
ALMOST BROKE DOWN TO THIS 🥲  IM SO TOUCHED 😊
Absolutely beautiful. I love the songs that are two people having a conversation.
damn, this is a straight classic for me just like i'm not racist!
This Joyner fucking bag. I don’t know why he keeps trying to be like the thousands of copy paste “gang rappers” Nobody needs gang rap. And Everyone needs to listen to Joyner music. the ones with a message, the ones with his story telling.
Preach
Joyner Lucas is the truth 🔥  Like my comment so that i will come back and listen to this master piece every time
Bro This song makes me cry, whether you’ve been through addiction or know somebody in it. I love how you rapped on both POVs 🔥🔥🔥
oH boy he did it again!!
🔥🔥🔥
Joyner storytelling is too much
Joyner ❤
One of the future GoaTs. Glad to see you live in Philly!! This is the art of lyricism!!!
First
Imagine if all rap was like this ❤️
I just love your Music
Jesus Joyner!!!! Thank you!!!!!!!!!
This shit brought me to tears thinking about the last time I said goodbye to my best friend who couldn't stay off of heroin. I had to distance myself, because if I didn't, I would likely go back to doing it myself. I stopped talking to him for two years and I found out he ultimately lost his battle at 25 years old. His face is still the background of my phone to this day.   Hope Joyner's message reaches more people.
Wow. Such an underrated artist in my opinion. Doesn’t get spoke about enough. Joyners been making better music then most artists out there
Joyner does it again!
These guys are 2 of the most lyrically beautiful rappers in the game period. They never seem to disappoint while touching down on the most controversial topics. Thanks for helping me try to help me. This music saves people like me and because y'all
Thanks for this . I was ready to throw in five years of sobriety. I remember why I got clean and sober again.
Pain pill addiction is real you gotta want to give that shi up gotta hit the bottom
The power behind this message hits so many of us personally! I have had to walk away from people I never imagined leaving. Please keep up the good fight for those who struggle. God bless
glad bro you are doing this type of work and not just diamond chains and bitches, need the old way of rap back fr
Check out my music!
great work OG Joyner and Jelly roll. they'll never know or try to understand all we can do is heal and keep pushing. i love hiphop. and ill never let that go.
Joyner is just beyond any rapper out right now
This right here is what makes him a genius...he can give u hits for the club but most importantly write lyrics that have the ability to reach down into the pits of your soul & speak the words you just havnt had the ability to put together yourself to describe the lives of so many but especially your own. We all can take his lyrics & relate it to our lives regardless of age, skin color, community or background to which we belong.   Ima white 46yr old Momma & Gmomma...half of my family is black & what Joyner has done for me is enable me to speak to & connect with my black sons on a deeper level that i didnt even realize we were in need of. Thats the mark or a true artist. Hes way more than a rapper...To me & mine -hes a truth speaker...a therapist...a activist...a teacher...one of those rare artist that comes along & uses his talent to positively influence & impact the lives of those who listen to & appreciate his gift in the way its meant to be interpreted. & with the state of the culture...musically...were in rn his voice is whats desperately needed.  This is the type of artist that should be pushed & promoted to the masses on a higher level...i read the comments of those saying - "why is Joyner so underrated" ...& i get what yal mean by inquiring that but i also just wanna remind yal that WE determine the level of an artist based upon how their able to impact us...& as long as we as individuals continue to listen to & support him by playing his songs & posting comments letting him know what he means to us he could never be "underrated" because we the fans are what gives him the fuel to continue sharing & speaking to us on the level that he does. My point being....we know whos important ..whos the best lyrically, whos making the most impact & whos absolutely vital to the world based upon the way hes making us feel & how he drives us to take the time to make these comments were making rn ...idk about yal but i dont bother posting or speaking on those that are irrelevant & arent speaking directly to me... So it doesnt matter what or who radio or corporate music media moguls decide to push &  promote... no matter how many diff cooks are in the kitchen...WE ARE IN CONTROL & WE DECIDE what we wanna eat to feed our souls.  We gotta stop worrying about what others dont recognize or acknowledge as greatness...let folks stay in their ignorance...our job is to enjoy what were smart enough to realize as masterful artistic genius when we hear it. Peace & Blessings to all who took the time to read my rant...😂
Just straight goosebumps ❤ Thank you for your craft 🙏 2 both of you
This hits hard for me I had that one that I couldn’t help
Joyner knows how to hit the spot every time not only with the lyrics and meaning of his songs but his visuals too, truly an artist and a legendary story teller‼️🔥
Bad ass !!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Duo hard 🔥
MUCH RESPECT FOR BOTH OF THESE DUDES. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE, ARTISTS. PERFECT COLLABORATION. VERY INTELLIGENT AND CREATIVE. THE LOSERS ARE WINNING AGAIN! LET'S GO ANTIOCH!!!!
good "both views" song.
so sick!
My mother has been addicted since she was 13…I’ve became the best adult and mother I could be. But this song really makes me feel feelings Ive been burying.
The rhyme , rhytm , beat , flow ..is  perfect 🔥🤝🌎
Wow, what a powerful song; I was able to overcome addiction 15 years ago.  Life isn't always easy, but at least I deal with it with a sober mind.  For those who know someone going through addiction, don't give up on them, as most often, they have given up on themselves.
fuck.....
🫵🏻👍🙏🏼🙏🏼💪🏼💪🏼🤲🏼love this song
this two ledgend representin massachusetts ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
this dude spit ❤‍🔥
real music right here,🔥 jelly roll has one of the most unique voices I've ever heard Joyner never fails to completely make us feel each and every line he raps gives me the chills every time💯 2 of my favorite artist right now we need a full album with the both of them
This is only video I watched to the end since 2005 😂😁😄And This is why I prefer buying data instead of buying a land
😭😭🇿🇦🩷😫👂
So crazy how he can portray both sides so fluidly and can see the struggles from both sides. Joyner is such a damn good artist.
"I'm sorry" part 2❤
People who don’t believe in addiction need too listen too this song
The song of 2024
Joyner reminds a lot of a german rapper called "Kontra K"... just so many truths and realness betweens the lines - GOAT!
Joyner x Jelly #615StandUp
Straight 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥 nuff said!
This is Fucking dope 🔥🙏🏼
There is no one like Joyner when it comes to telling realistic stories. His messages are real.
Another heartfelt banger this one hits deep, Sometimes we forget to open our minds to the opposite side of the conversation.....
I thought that the singer was the actor from im not racist
Beautiful
Didn’t see this collab coming?!? 😮 Woah! Very powerful!
DAMN, JOYNER JELLY HITS HARD..
As someone who struggles with daily drinking alcohol 🥃 this makes me tear up . 😔
Wow man😭💯🙏🏾❤️🔥🔥
This is for my mother (2016 🕊️) my brother (2019 🕊️) and my best friend (2021 🕊️) 💫 see you again
This is going to really help people.
speechless straight 🔥🔥🔥
Joyner Lucas this was amazing
One of my bothers (not biological) lost his step mom to an OD from this same issue and he was destroyed about it
I can't thank you enough for this song. I've lost all my friends and some family to addiction. Most of my friends are dead and a couple are in prison doing 20 years. I was lucky enough to survive my o.d. and now I've been sober for almost 6 years. # best for me❤❤❤ 🔥🔥🔥
Dope jawn but jelly don't need the effects gotta just let him sing
🔥🔥🔥
When I was 25 my own mother robbed my house.. this one got me in the feels for sure. I love how Joyner does both perspectives too. 🫂❤🕊️
As someone who almost lost to the battle of addiction this track hits home, Joyner is the 🐐 of this generation right next to Cole and Kendrick. Argue with the wind
Thank you for making this song 🎵 Jelly roll you are of a kind person God sent you here to heal people that hurt the most kept doing what you do brother God bless you 🙏 ❤️
The rap industry *_needs_* more conscious artists like Jelly and Joyner 🙏
Jelly roll vocals gives me chills down my spine
We got 508 Joyner back…. I stared to fear we’d never see him again 😮‍💨😔🔥
Losing someone you love to addiction leaves a wound on your soul that can't be healed.
This is so insane !!!
Swear I’ve heard this before even tho it just came out
Joyner the 🐐
Great song.
FIRE FIRE N EFFING FUEGOOOO
🔥🔥🔥Joyner Lucas.....enough said!!!
Yo this Colab is Crazyyyy.
🔥
Daaaaaamn you hit the nail on the head for so many on so many levels awesome 🔥🔥🔥loving it
This will stay relevant even the next century ...
Gay sh*t??? 🙄
Joyner.Lucas.don't.miss 🥹🔥🥹🔥🥹🔥
W O W
Got DAMN... 😢.. this is a masterpiece from 2 amazingly talented individuala... it hits deep
Would love to see Joyner Lucas and Jelly Roll perform this song together🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Been needed this years! Glad two underground titans finally did a collab😆
I was in the Seventeen music video at the oh wow frozen yogurt and smoothie shop. Coming from northboro mass, this song so powerful. Been waiting for a collab like this ❤ we needed a song like this
legendary song already
It may sound cliche but..... This Man Never Misses. I haven't heard a Joyner Lucas song that hasnt touched or had meaning to someone somewhere. His pen is untochable these days and very few today or in the past can tell a story like him. Love him or hate him he is a Force....
This is so real ,no bullshit . I LOVE IT. Jelly your voice is God given and stunning
What’s the sample on this I’ve heard the chorus before?
this hits home my dad died of from a drug addiction 10 months ago that tore his heart and everything in him failed, and my mom is still doing them and roaming the streets. i know its hard to be there for them but try your hardest because eventually drugs will catch up with you and it hurts to have regrets on what you couldve done better.
Streamed this song since it was aired 12 hours ago but watching the video hits different. Amazing as always 🔥
I did not expect this collaboration at all! Everything is fire! Topic, production, lyrics, melodies, everything.
I have had the thought of this duet happening didn't know the universe had the same idea and put it motion A.S.A.P
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Joyner's storytelling is just out of this world. U can't find a another new gen rapper like Joyner. Truly nextup GOAT 🔥🐐💯
My God this song is everything ❤ thank you Joyner and Jelly!
Love this video beyond words. Thank you for being a voice and awareness for all.
Too bad this is relatable to 99.9 percent of people... 401 to the 508 stand up...
His videos are as addictive as his music top quality 💪
💯🤍
God damn boy. Just damn.
lets run this up, it needs to go number 1!!!
Ill snort a line of fire ants for every like this comment gets
Wow. That was deep. Great song and visuals. 💯
He's busy fr 🔥🔥
As someone who lost both younger brother and older sister to overdoses this song really hits home....
Dope video!
Thank you joyner Lucas 🌹🌹🌹
I NEED JELLY RAPPING AGAIN! FUCK! 😭 this singing and country shit at least don't reach me the same way..  Where's the service for the OGs that's been buying and listening since gambling on a white boy, since whiskey,  weed and waffle house. We want jelly roll back damnit. 😂
Gem
This was so powerful. Thank you both.
The one that's always been there through me drugs
Damn, I felt That
goosebumps
I knew this song was going to hit, I didn't think it was going to hit me this hard though❤️‍🩹

If you are sick of the rap industry’s standards, check out my music💪 I’m here to reset the culture back to spiritual messages 💯
This is real fucking music man. FIRE
I love it two of my favorite artist 🔥🔥❤️❤️
Jelly should’ve had a verse on this, not just the chorus. This could’ve been way more dope. Chorus feels a bit too high pitched. Jelly can spit Joyner, come on now. The track is good, but I’m honesty disappointed. Love the collaboration, hope you two have another track where you both spit.
Iam in drug withdrawl right now iys really hard all body aching and suddenly i got this song it help me joyner that all what i want to say you told it in this song
Beautiful art🙏🏽👏🏽💐🌟💯

❤
Absolute fire 🔥, relatable to me and thousands of others. Fire lyrics from both, Jelly hitting them notes too sheeeeesh 🎶 😅
I felt this in my soul. Having best friends I do not see anymore because of their drug addictions. I hope this song spreads to everybody that needs to find some peace and help.
Gary this is your time!! Rn your the greatest lyricist in the game 💯
This is ❤
I am the addict in  my family and you did this perfectly. I was crying immediately lol..   amazing work you guys did together.  SO excited to listen to this album
"How come your only there for me when I be trying to get clean"😟
Wow powerful stuff Joyner and Jelly absolutely killed this.
EVERYONE WAKEUP JOYNER UPLOADED ANOTHER MUSIC VIDEO!!
The hardest, part, for an addict in recovery, watching others you love continue to die 🙏
Should put a trigger warning on for sensitive material. PTSD. Miss Daniel. R.i.P you're now my guardian angel. I know you're finally Clean now that you're in heaven with your mom. I love you brother cousin. You were better than you thought. I needed you more than I thought. I feel like I'm walking through life alone now. Really wish you were here with me. I'm mad at you for not letting me say I love you one more time. Or not even saying goodbye to me. I really lost a chunk of my heart the day I got that call you were gone. I'm broken.....for eternity now.😪
Legend
incredible. I love you Joyner! Jelly Roll is ok too ;) AMAZING
joyner is so fucking cool. his story telling and speaking in the second person is just awesome.   reminds me of ross capicchioni. this one here will be dope. cant wait to get the album.
Joyner Saved HipHop🙏🏽
I was raised an only child and always wanted a sibling. The closest I ever got to that was my cousin. Even though we were the same age, growing up I always looked up to him as the "big brother" I never had. As time went on however, we grew apart. Whereas I went onto get good grades and a job, he ended up joining a gang and getting arrested repeatedly. Just a few days ago, I received a call informing me that he did meth for the first time and went insane, attempting to murder his neighbors. I'm in tears as I type this because I know this time around when he goes to prison he's most likely not getting back out. I feel regret because I feel like there's something I should've said or did years ago to help him get his life back on track. Don't make the same mistake I did. If there's someone you care about, take action while you still have the chance.
❤🔥🔥🔥
Dast forward through garbage ass jellyroll and his autotuned bullshit
Wow 🔥🔥
I'm shook. I can't wait for the album Joyner! Bravo homie, you never cease to impress me.
You always inspire me alot Joyner may God give you energy to keep on giving us dope vibes
We've been waiting for this!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Big track

JOYNEERRR IS BACKKK 🔥🔥🔥can't wait for the album
Nice one nkabi yami🔥🔥🔥🔥
yesssss🔥🔥😫
Yooo this is AMAZING. I love that artists are becoming more aware
With how the world is now a days.....this shit hits hard...love it
Love you Joyner 🔥🔥🔥 thank you!!!
Fire 🔥 you never disappoint ❤
Every song with jelly lately is a cant miss and with a strong message
Dude.... This shit damn near made me cry. I'm two years clean, been through both sides of what this song talks about. Wow...
joyner lyrics with jelly vocals on the hook pure gold
Jelly is everywhere now salute to hardwork
See you may 24 I’m so excited to meet my idle
I was supposed to leave for rehab today and plans didn't work out but it seems you always drop a song exactly when I need it.
This song hits home wish jelly roll rapped in this also
Joyner my daughter loves your songs, so so much. She's going through depression, it's been 12 years now. This year she's turning 30 and she's been saying for years now that she won't make it to that birthday .. she's tried to take her life twice and thank god she failed. I don't want there to be a third. She was also diagnosed with anxiety & recently with adhd. We've tried everything to help her, we haven't stopped, but I don't know what else to do. If I may ask, could you please make a song like this, where people hear both sides of the story but about her situation? I know many more are going through the same & it would also be helping all of those people too.. Music has a lot of power, that's a fact, and she already has days where she won't even listen to music no more. If you do read this, please consider it. Thank you
Love how Joyner always tells both sides to every story. Always hits it every time too. Joyner the 🐐#MAALLDAY
❤❤🔥🔥🔥🤧🤧
🔥🔥🔥
I'm not a racist vibes are strong on this one!
The colab I didnt know I needed!!!
https://youtu.be/Ch5P_7LnNck?si=v_4AN09_pYOTw0DT
Im not gonna lie this had me tearing up. Very powerful song and visual. Hip hop has been lacking in this department and Joyner definitely filled the void. This should go #1
Soul Touching ❤
This gave me goosebumps I had a close friend who passed away due to drug addictions R.i.P Dom Love you dawg 🙏❤
Joyner thank you for getting jelly envolved! Soberness is legit and can happen
Lettttsss goooo 🐐
damn… all love joyner this one just hit hard.
Caseoh got vocals
Lost my sister to addiction and my brothers one foot in deaths door. Sad fucking state of affairs. I miss them.
Jelly + Joyner!!! Lfg!!!!
WOW THIS BROKE ME DOWN THIS SONG IS TO REAL
STORYTELLING.
27 minutes too late to the show but my god what a show!
I love the song but why all the autotune on JellyRoll, I get it's a creative choice but Jelly doesn't need and if anything it takes away from his voice.
Joyner never fails 💯🔥
Thank you for bringing awareness to this disease. For sharing both sides of the hell we go through as addicts and the people that love us. I have 1 yr clean as of March 3 and it's the hardest fight I've ever been in. I Love you is something we don't hear in active addiction,until someone shows us by staying. Please don't give up on us.
goooooooooooosebumps .😭🔥
Man i felt this deep down in my soul 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song gives me goosebumps. lost my brother to addiction couple months ago after i distanced myself to do whats best for me. the guilt eats me alive. this song shows both sides of addiction its awful.
Joyner back with a banger storytelling song. Cant wait for the album on friday.
To anyone going through something. Don't try and find a way out, find a way through.
Nobody better or realistic as Joyner!🎤🎤🎤🎤🎤
Ouch
I was one of the homeless people in the broke and stupid video. Coming up on 25 months clean. All my friends are dead. Literally. I may not like everyday, but I'm so grateful for a second chance at life. Addiction is cunning
This song just might save my life...
Every addict felt this song ❤️❤️❤️❤️💯
🦅
(wiping tears)Thank you. You both always make my brain tick after your songs. I look forward to your future collaborations
This shit is real! Joyner is real for showing it. Much respect. And Jelly on it makes it that much better.
This really hits home! Lost too many good people in this world to pills/narcotics. It’s time we make a change! I’m a recovering addict!
"If you don't believe in yourself, then you'll never believe in somebody believing in you" 💯🔥
when you coming to TORONTO?
Epic collaboration 2 of the best to do it ❤
The switch to the drug addict's perspective went stupid deep. Excellent work guys.
What a tune can't wait for the new album 🙌
❤❤❤
Joyner never disappoints. Thanks for this broski
Sooo good Joyner 🔥
Man always knows how to come through at them right times an hit that certain spot in me man 🔥😭

So much emotions behind this song! Probably top 5 songs from Joyner

Amazing song!
Bro❤ you wrote this knowing you were gonna connect with millions. I got tears in my eyes listening to this. My family has been destroyed by addiction. And it’s so hard. Because the one you love is gone. And then to hear the other side…. Dope ass song bro. Dope ass song
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song is so good. My best friend had a drug addiction and i relate to this song on so many levels
Best by far
love it <3
Thank you joyner, for everything you have got me through with your music.❤
I needed this.❤
"if you dont believe in yourself then you'll never believe in somebody believing in you" amazing

No one does music videos better than Joyner
This song is so mf heavy. I've known too many people that aren't here anymore because of this.
omg. Amazing.
“Is it really love if you have to ask if they’ll stay”🔥🔥
Joyner Lucas is a genius an he makes real music and target real everyday situations
Man. Joyner can show us perspectives we never thought we'd see. Thanks for this.
Getting back to that early Joyner vibe, hell yeah 🎉
Not going to lie this way fire but I was really looking forward to jelly going off in a verse.
Joyner Lucas Is my Role Model ❤️
Beautiful work Joyner and Jelly Roll.
Joyner is really one of the best storytelling rapper to touch the mic🙏
Joyner with another one!

I love you sissy. I miss you the old you. The way we used to laugh and tell each other we would always have each other's backs. I still got you. No matter what you will beat this addiction. I'll always keep praying you do. ❤
This song hits hard for those friends struggling with substance. Its hard to help when sometimes they don't want to help themselves.
Nice surprise for my Monday!! Thanks, Joyner!
Omg 🔥🔥🔥
Damn I just cried…. Bravo my Guy 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾💎✨🌙👑💯🤯
No words. 💕
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That 2nd verse really fucked me up 😢
Man this is feeling like old Joyner. No flexing, no cars and women. It’s Joyner at his best, writing about something real from different perspectives.
Man shit got speechless… feel like this song was talking to me
On repeat 🎶
Digging it
He doesn't have a bad song ❤
Joyner Lucas is a livin legend 💥
The collab we never knew we needed
Fuckin finally!! Long time coming!! Shit hit me right in my feels
OMG the message that's here is touching ❤😢
Watching this makes me glad AF that I'm sober. Joyner always coming with the cinematics and the verses with two different perspectives. Well done.
As someone who survived the lowest of lows, that last verse crushed my soul
❤
OMGGGG
What a song! Put a like if you want to help find ways to stop big pharma and know someone who’s been through or is going through addiction and you just want to help because you love them! 💯🧡🙏🏼💪🏼
Joyner touching souls he don't even know about. How bro talks in both perspectives is so amazing. One of the best to ever do it👌🏽

Danko Joyner, the album gon be 🔥🌋
Love the beat and lyrics from both, sick song 🔥🔥
My good friend oded on December 23rd, the moment he started rapping about addiction I got reminded of him and our last conversation of him saying he wouldn't od. I got goosebumps the moment Jelly Roll started singing and then broke down when joyner came on I wish I could have shown him this.
This is going in the mf vault..
I really need this just got out of a bad relationship and I’ve been drinking every day off and falling into shit I shouldn’t be I’m stopping NOW before I end up hurting my family. This song was the first thing to come up and I feel like it was a sign that I you guys.

OMG PLEASE TELL ME YOU WILL COME TO TN AND JOIN JELLY ROLL IN CONCERT & PERFORM THIS SONG...your my favorite artist but u haven't came to my city & I been dying to see u live.   This song reminds me of when I first heard u..back when the song IM SORRY came out. I lost my ex to suicide & that song hit me so hard & made it possible for our sons to own exactly how they felt but didn't know how to express it . You gave them the words.& im so grateful ...I love & respect you & your gift ...TRUE LYRACIST....& Jelly fits this song perfectly.  I personally believe yals voices are saving lives. Please come to East Tn Joyner....we need u
Damn!!! Joyner the G.O.A.T sending a message and motivating those who need support. I lost my job today but this song helped me heal.. thank you Joyner for sharing your wisdom and experience through this song.
This is why Joyner is above EVERY other modern day rapper: the intricate storytelling that cuts deep and doesn't spout off repetitive bullshit.
Real Joyner
This is such a beautiful song ❤
Joyner must be on China time
Thank you ❤ drugs have take 3 of my favorite people in the whole world. I know your song will help people.   Thanks for not just being another rapper. You care.
Beautiful music as always

Sooo many feelings with this song! Love it! Both great artists!
music genius!!
This a real collab much love from tesla courp..
Proud of every single person in this camp🖤🎥📈 Joyner & Jelly to the moon
Jelly Would have killed it on the second verse. He’s been there before and he raps his ass off
Joyner knows who to get for the bangers
He just don't miss. Jelly with the chorus, though? Maaaaaaaaaaan listen. I been ready for the album.
Too real! I did a song on Addiction too. Let’s pray everyone heal from addiction https://youtu.be/eAIkaeMYNqc?si=CgNp1uIBcDntlZmY
SOOOO GOOD 💔❤‍🩹😪
Man..... Same formula you always use---- Was excited to see Jelly, until I realized y'all auto-tuned the hell out of his voice. I stuck around thinking, shit, maybe Jelly will rap on this it's been a minute and the subject matter is right up his ally. This really could have been anyone on the hook; which makes this a huge missed opportunity considering the crossover appeal.
Why i thought this guy is rag'n'bone man?
Lesss goooo
Sick dude
Joyner🔥
🫡🫡
The man that has mastered his craft ❤
I've never had a song make me cry before like this.
Jelly auto tuned is a vibe.
Wow. This is deep ❤ I absolutely love it..rapping about substance not about about bullshit
LETS GOOOOO JELLYYYY
The chills i got when i saw the feature. Never thought id need this collab ❤
Dynamic duo
Joyner is one of the most underrated people in the game rn man
😭😭😭
OKAYYY THIS IS SO GOOD
