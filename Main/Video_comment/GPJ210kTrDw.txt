Who loved the Heavenly theme? Which theme should we use next? 😁 For more inventions videos like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suT82AdWfTU&list=PLflqtq8EOGAKZ_F5dbjVaEnMcKrFR56hy&index=2
I dont have any lactase enzymes, i lacthose😂
7:15 im never earing paper again
I wanna see a video of how all of these inventions are doing now and how much are they growing.
9:08 the solar cooker sounds great, as long as you aren’t worried about actually having properly cooked food in a set amount of time
I think one of the biggest, or really probably the biggest problem for environmentally better products is the cost. If the companies want to truly be able to make a significant difference they need to be able to do it in a cost effective manner, so they can offer the product to consumers at or near the same price as the competing products they are trying to replace. I just saw an add for a toothpaste replacement called Bite Bits or something like that, it’s little pill like things you chew/bite and start brushing, basically they slightly harden toothpaste into an alto it’s like pellet. The problem is it’s like $40 for the equivalent of a tube of toothpaste, so Bill Gates may get some for his private jet, but the average person working to get by and keep their kids clothed isn’t going to “care enough” to switch from a $5 tube of Colgate. Not long ago I saw a video about Tide Tiles, that are laundry tiles that use less packaging, but again they are like double the price or more of the big economy size container of Tide per load, in this case I looked online and and found Poesie Detergent sheets. These are about the 2 inches by 3 inches and come simply in a sliding cardboard box, they equal out to less than 10 cents per load, and they work. I ordered some and have done a few loads of laundry with them and they seem to work well, clothes seem clean, and smell good/neutral, they are not overly scented, but there were other scent options you could choose if you wanted something perhaps. I don’t really know if it’s as green a product as it claims, they may club baby seals at their factory for all I know, but it seems to work, and be a better/greener option and is cheaper than what I am trying to replace, this is what companies need to do if they want to actually have a successful “green” product. I know I am late to the comments and perhaps no one will see this, but it’s my 2 cents, and info about a product that seems to be a better option.
0:32 oh man, this episode might be a doozy for me on the comments. From the looks of that jacket it was better as garbage killing sea turtles in the ocean
0:27 how does someone stealing my old plastic to make clothes in order to make money give me faith in humanity, they are stealing my good plastic garbage
0:12 oh my sweet summer child, you know nothing
8:07 i think a solar panel or a hydroelectric one would be better since well there isnt wind everyday
Marcus Aurelius would be proud.
4:41 as soon as I heard bacon I got hungry so I made some and now I’m eating it
guys do any of these have public stocks?
Price?
bro believes tv scientists lol
1:20 it was a scam and they ran away with the money😀
Bro i shower for 1.8 minutes 😅
How i missed that bro became Sezar 👽
Similar to #15, There is a restaurant in italy that my family went to and they served their drinks with pasta straws, which also could be then eaten with sauce and meatballs. Sadly it closed due to health reasons because of the oysters.
6:47 That's suspicious
More vids pls
I need to charge my power bank. Let me go to the beach.
packaging made from mushrooms that can be thr own in the garden gets a 4 out of 10....all the packages you get constantly and that only gets a 4....i guess you were showing an example of how money dictates an opinion.
1:17 it was a scam
The plastic clothing is cool, but wearing plastic is not good for health
Love Ur videos and huel. Dream video
i love those Inventions
90% sure this video is what introduced me to this channel... but honestly who knows with my memory
Caught the “that’s what” joke
7:18 koala poo is also really good for it!
thanks for the vid
Why don’t we abandon 4 wheel drive and turn are front two tires into moderately sized/mini generators?

Day 16 of asking Mr Boss for a OP gaming PC
Of course top 1 is keep on reaching technical singularity to find a way, creating quantum computers and to flee the reality resetting the world in different universes to spread human live past planet earth and make our universe to collapse and recreate itself to start the whole thing again and at some point we have perfectly fine nature 100%
Excuse me 4:40
Transparent solar infront of normal solar
I 7:09 i think everyone just got rickrolled by a piece of paper 7:09 7:09 7:09 7:09 7:09 7:09 7:09
Inventory confused me do they actually convert oxide into oxygen
transparent solar panels are the best
13:32 "stray" for the ps5... Nope
I can’t have #7 I’m Allergic
You drink through a paper straw from a plastic cup, makes sense. Smfh
The real holy grail of solar probably isn't earth based. It'll happen in space where the efficiency is much higher, always on, and unaffected by atmosphere. Harvest it there and beam it down to earth as microwaves. The transmission isn't very efficient but the amounts you could harvest are mind boggling so it doesn't even really matter.
A little request - please make a comparison between asus zenbook 14 oled and dell 14 plus. laptop. they're 2025 - AI powered and really interesting Cheers!
Roads made of plastic is a bad idea unless it doesn't shed micro plastic. Imagine millions of cars and people using that road and it shed micro plastic everywhere. I think we have enough plastic as it is. There's no need for more unmanageable plastic that sticks on you every time you are outside.
with all this plastic talk, what do you do with microplastic residue ?
Bro is not Jesus
13:36 i dont. Im lactose intolerant
7:31 why did i get rickrolled
Energy cannot be generated only transferred 3:02
I love how you added chandelure
if u eat your tableware, u dont need tableware. u could just put your food on the ground.
who got 50k to love in an egg?!
vacuum sealed...   u mean airtight?
Hello, I love your videos. I have wind and it's normally from the back end. It's called a fart❤
oef.. plastic roads.. so now micro particles can just flood into all our water systems when it rains
why sell wheat plates to reduce plastic pollution, when you package them in plastic.
6:48 big pause
7:33  i’ve been rick rolled?
Bro left the bacon
Couldn’t you just use a metal straw?
1:11 Das war absolut nicht richtig ausgesprochen
5:01 WAIT IS THIS HALAL ✋ 😐 🤚 absolute cinema
my room isnt 30cm by 60cm tall bruh 6:12
It’s been a few years. A follow up video would be good.
@Mrwhosetheboss where do i find the ecohouse company
Thanks I’m doing my final project on self balancing motorcycle for cybersecurity
i just grabbed a package of cookies and the next thing you show me is paper made from poop?.. bruh ;-;
Time to get a part 2! It's been 3 years and tech has seen a major world change, would love this, please!

11:46 Wise words  🤩 I could invest and support all of these!
same hwere in Auatralia
The only person that could save us is Jesus Christ! And he loves you all❤
10:15 yeah there is because some people like me are allergic to wheat
I am NOT moving my PC setup, 2 cats and piles of gadgets and decorations into the house orb
I strongly disagree with the claim that vegan leather and vegan products are inherently better for the environment or animal welfare.  Durability & Waste – Vegan leather is not very durable, making it a cheap, disposable alternative. Products that wear out quickly contribute to waste and, ironically, environmental harm.  Global Supply Chain Issues – Many vegan products are produced in countries with limited regulations and then exported worldwide to consumers who believe they are making ethical choices. However, the raw materials often aren't sourced locally, and since there are very few manufacturers capable of producing these products, the carbon footprint of transportation and production is substantial.  Meat Industry Growth & Health Concerns – Veganism isn’t reducing the demand for meat, as the industry continues to grow. Many vegan meat substitutes rely on highly processed plant proteins that our bodies are not designed to digest in the same way as animal proteins. Unlike animals with multiple stomachs designed for plant digestion, humans lack the necessary biological adaptations to efficiently break down and absorb certain plant-based proteins.  In Conclusion: As someone who rescues obligate carnivores, I find it frustrating that veganism is often promoted as a sustainable solution when, in reality, it's another trend rather than a universal answer. If you choose to follow a vegan diet, it's important to recognize the high level of processing, chemical additives, and environmental costs involved in producing vegan meat alternatives. While the actual production process may appear eco-friendly, the global transportation, limited manufacturing locations, and industrial processing create a significant carbon footprint.  Additionally, many vegan influencers who promoted strict plant-based diets have since transitioned to vegetarianism due to serious health issues, including nutritional deficiencies and brain fog. Our bodies are designed to extract nutrients from a combination of animal and plant sources—hence why we have the teeth structure for both.  At the end of the day, highly processed food—whether vegan or not—contains preservatives, emulsifiers, and excessive salt that can be just as harmful to your health as conventional processed meat. The idea that all vegan products are automatically healthier or more sustainable is misleading.
1:50 Can you stir-fry it?
Also the transparent solar panels can protect you from UV too lol
Gabs
10:14 Besides being allergic to wheat 😅
4:04 you’re drinking from like you’re drinking bubble tea from the company that I always get from and is the king of all companies when it comes to ice tea I mean, bubble tea, respect, respect that’s what I can say

This guy has 2 goal 1:explain tech 2: rickroll
6:52 bro really tested my dirty mind with that comment
What about Zipline??
Fritz haber
a 25 minute shower at 2.5 gallons a minute is less than 63 gallons of water, which is barely enough to fill a 3 by 3 by 2 feet room
wh6 was that milk so thick tho 13:38
Bro be chewing his plates….   ( 10:57 )
I swear if that was me I would have just thrown off the headband by now!It’s literally about to cover his eyes!! 😅.   10:07
9:11 the look that he gives just kills me 😭
This is AWESOME! I showed this to my teenage students.  I really hope they follow up and develop these tech.
I like the poo paper! 💩
4:41 “bacon”
The title ABSOLUTELY doesn’t fit the thumbnail😭
6:47 dont take this out of context
I love eating feggs and facon
Poo paper sounds good BUT I like eating paper sooooo
The problem with replacing plastic with wheat is that SO many people have life-threatening gluten allergies
6:47 🤨
The best part is that none of these will ever go anywhere or become mainstream, as great as they are.
I understand, trying to save elephants but due to anti-poaching efforts there are warehouses in Africa that have HUNDREDS OF TONS of seized ivory.  Without sny way to sell or dispose of it.  The current solution is label it as 'authentic' and sell, but the stigma of using/selling ivory makes this very, very hard.
Don't forget Nuclear Fusion Reactors!.
9:15 where do I go bathroom now.
Who are these people taking 25min showers? How do you have so much time???
The game Stray explains exactly why mealworms are a bad idea.
Errr....  6:13 - a 1000 glasses would be 10 glasses wide, 10 glasses deep and 10 glasses tall. Not that much...
#5 is literally just a Gooble Box from Rick and Morty…
My worm can save this planet. Especially with its two closest buddies.
All of them terrible ideas

Bacon? Is it really a stop for someone? Or it's mostly a joke?
we were studding most of this in year 5 (2 years ago) when u posted dis video
Bruh 1:08, and pause it
Please update the description to have links for each...
How does bro find out all this stuff lol😂😂😂
5:37 guys, you have to understand, leather is not the main product, it’s the by-product. They are raised and the killed for the meat, the leather is just a byproduct of the animal. You aren’t saving animals by using vegan leather
Hey about Elecosy, the first company to start elephant dung paper is called “eco maximus” from Sri Lanka. And they will feed elephants with different flowers and you can get different patterned papers. And I did my wedding invitations on that paper ❤
Damn,that stray future looking real close now
f the nature big corporations are important, OIL, LITHIUM , LOCKHEED MARTIN
Mealworms might sound gross but they are actully really tasty. You should try some Arun.
Can you eat the mushroom box
eat animals save grass for vegens.
10:57 second for me the best plate I had was the plate I made out of Play-Doh when I was three
1:58 so is it edible?
4:00 in Malaysia there is a coffee shop (also sell soft drink) edit:I forgot the name:zus coffee gives u an edible straw
Nice
Grow a tree 🌲 or two
Man did not create the earth. So this is just CARP
Yes
“Algy” hurts my soul
🤔So we have drones that can plant a whole forest in a day  Why don't we use them to restore Amazon rainforest or just any forest??? I mean by that rate we can get the whole green cover back in a decade, can't we?
Wait if your killing cows to eat or get beef why can't we take leather from them ?? Why this much prosses
Hilo jengo likirushiwa jiwe watu wengi mtaani watapiga algae

The only way I could do that was
20 pints of water per minute for a shower?!? Either there's something wrong with them in the last 3 places I've lived, or you've got some sort of super shower.
If you blended huel woth more sunflower deeds, you will get the made up Huel: Dragons blood edition
But is the method of making clothes from plastic good for environment? that's more important
We should eat planes ... plastic road would not work, in soviet union they made concrete blocks - they build buildings out of it, roads  ... because it was not one complete piece it started to sink ... each in different depth ... made bumpy journey these hollow blocks of plastic will do even worse they will start to crack and it will be damaged by sun, acid rains it will be brittle in few months/years - concept and idea is nice how ever its not going to last for long and reapiring hole ... imagine how long it takes to fix small pot hole where in the end all you need is bucket of asphalt and hand held propan heater ... here you would have to remove whole block everything what is inside so you would need lorry crane etc.

9:52 my Recommendation. Buy normal plates that are reusable
these vegans are starting to take over the world
A kind of bacteria can recycle PET plastic
Please dont mock Jesus Aron.

Wow 2.5 gallons per minute and my uncle takes 1hr long showers so he’s using 4000 gallons of water that’s crazy
UK GANG HERE
Watching this 2 Years later... Seeing the ad in the end... Also do a flashback to see what became of these techs.
6:45 ayo pause
10:00 hey Mom, can you make me a snack? No our plates expired
I have faith in humanity 💪🏻💪🏻
You did not have to bring bacon into this
0:58 how many tryes to cache it
same here in Australia
Uhhh...  1:08
Can't wait fpr nonr pf these to talked about till 2030
Can you pls tell me where did you get that repreve jacket
So I don’t got the enzymes to break down milk😊
I watched a man be sponsored 21 times for entertainment
just went on Repreve sand the counter does not stop its going faster than i can type
Windows XP
Ummmmm what did you say?
10:31 stop eating my plate 😠
Vegan Leather ❌  Pinather ✅
Bro really said “howether”
You are too attached to your over the top rich guy style to leave enough room for the actual information we look for 😊 Unsubscribe 😊
2:49 Chandelure!
05:50 I actually use a bucket and cup to shower. My whole family does.
This stuff is amazing! Looking up most of it as it's made me curious  I think #7 has an issue, though. Say it's used as plastic replacement at a BBQ, party, dorm, etc, those with celiac disease or wheat allergy would have to be informed. No one would think to ask/ guess a plate is made of something that is poisonous to them, and could cause serious harm   Sort that out and they're golden

Then you see the price...
Stevie has been known to cause cancer. Rare cases, but enough for me to stay away. Rather be diabetic than have cancer. But I'm know one to talk. It's hard to quit smoking.
Vegan foods are fine but if you eat nothing but plants youll die or get sick.
‘Cloud storage’ 😂
the elephants are only worth money to the people who utilize them... not the poachers.. that will do nothing, other than the farmer types looking after the animals better maybe. or more likely exploiting them to extinction in the wild.. also the poachers will just shoot the farmers.. they shoot game wardens so why would they give a second thought to shooting a worthless farmer
*Sees tree planting drone. Claps in Finnish.*  You guys still farbehind from us!
12:02 imagine that in a high school basketball court or soccer field
I’m I want to go in a plane and I love me. I literally love me. I eat meat like every day.
Idea a item that can turn plastic into 3d printer filament (you may steal this but I want a cut 10%)
Big props for including vegan food. It is such an easy fix for soooo many issues.
"Cost?"
All the vegans watching this 😂😂
the top three had me googling this stuff
You can’t give something a 2/10 just because there’s better stuff, bad scoring system
For one like i will to 5 pushups a jumping jacks
I wonder how long it took for him to catch those soap bottles perfectly?
Divine all the way up to godly really got me lol
Jona britenhuber😂😂😂
paper staws are the bane of my life
"dude, this paper is shit" "correct"
Even at 50% of the generating capacity of standard opaque photovoltaic panels the transparent photovoltaic would be a great booster for power. You could have fewer panels on the roof and have your windows pick up the difference. At some point, maybe, we could have transparent photovoltaic window panels that can match current standard power generation and maybe even more but until then they'd still be a great investment.
Heavenly Intro Sound Name?
When he said every minute we shower waste 2.5 gallon of water I’m like WTF we have infinite water😡🔫🔫🔪✋🏽👿🔲🤒💩👾🤖👻🤢😪🙄🫠🤗🥴✋🏽🧑🏻‍✈🌎☄🌊☂🫧🎧🎻🎳🖲🖲🕹💻💴💶💴💶💴💶💴💶💶💶💴💶💶💴💶💶💴💶💴💶💸💸💸🎙📟💸💵💸💰💵💵💸🏆💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💵💸🗝

Vegan bacon? Blasphemer!!!!
I don't have lactase enzymes
How about if you Target your these videos to investors who would like to invest in certain projects grow the money and grow their wealth?
I will have to disagree on the last one. It's a freat idea to put these solar panels on skyscrapers. But the electrical components that it requires to function need to be cool and they need space for themselves. On small scale i could work but on the bigger scale with today's technology no way.
As usual, many of the items claimed as great inventions here turn out to be flops in reality. The Gosun Fusion, for example, demonstrates a serious problem with heat efficiency with its own components, since its rounded red rubber edge can literally melt. The legs lock up a lot, it cooks inefficiently when there isn't a lot of sun or on a cloudy day, and many people complain about burns. Additionally, it's components wear out fast and with its price, it is definitely not worth it.
Like and I do 0 pushup
We need a part 2 to this
That reusable straw though.... Eeeeeeyyyyyaakkkk....
but what's happening with the worm thing? Have they made any breakthroughs in the 2 years this video has been out?
will vegans ever realize that, the animals they're saving help global warming and over-grazing?
This dude saved the world in a crazy way by …     Dyeing  on the cross for you and his name is Jesus Christ
no one ever thought about u being allergic to mushrooms
alot of companies already made clothes out of plastic 😊
poo-paper is not only for that company, it is actually fairly popular in Thailand now since Thailand is populated with elephants.
Hey Aron at number 5 the device like a pressure pad for electricity can be fixated and integrated under waterways and ships and submarines. What do you think about it?
The first feware great and all… but the last 3 are planet-saving
My freind was just talking about trying to make solar panels transparent,i thiught it was impossible but i was wrong
Imagine being a parent of more than 20,000 children
I never thought mealorms would be so helpful in saving humanity
So mealsworms are the key to destroying plastic? Wowoowwowoow!!!!
I never thought something as small and measly as mealworms would be in the top 3
Its ironic how long it tkaes for plastic to break down seeing as so mcuh is single use
Im waiting for the final one edited to see what is better than ecocapsules
So your saying i can draw with air pollution
Edible food containers are odd yet genius.
I want to design and make stuff like this
The ecocapsule is crazy and i want one but bigger
7:24.. and incentivises people to not eat it
Why did you rickroll us all?
Oh my god i hate paper sraws i hate them so much help
Algae arent plants!!!!
Biohybrid things are amazing
Imagine just washing your poo with poo paper and reusing it for making more paper😅
plastic eating worms are great, i like that, don't tell bear grills tho
17:33
I could not go without meat for one day. ONE DAY! I love meat🥩
7:15 bruh we could use water too
Bruh you had to give a rickroll even in this video as well
Heul = plastic bag (black color) ?
I love how piñatex just became a generalized name for pineapple leather
Greek god of tech
€50k in malaysia you can get proper house with 3 rooms
What about covered grills?
Don’t worry my shower time is 5 minutes 3 time a week
6:46 whoa buddy you gotta calm down. Keep it PG
7:00 I know it is made from elephant poop
Nice!
You should make a followup on this. On how these inventions lasted or deeloped.
I love the fake senatorial toga
Can we get a bloopers reel for all the throws gone wrong pls
Stop with the puns
Make my day :)
Crazy ahh thumbnail.
13:00 I actually remember reading this in a book in 2014 and NOBODY has said anything about it on other forms of media that I have come across until now. Thanks :D
I have a new favorite MOST HATED WORD pronounced by a British person. lol
4:07  The bottle: 🗿
Propaganda
Do get huel
Never chewing paper again
Dogs be like looking through the window it’s just a black box
Veganism is stupid and causes way more pollution and global warming. And paper is stupid, it is not needed and should not exist. Everything should be digital nowadays.
8:43 yeah thats nice but doesnt most of bbq flavour coming from the smoke that fire makes without smoke it wouldnt taste the same right???
That shower looks sooooo bad
The speed that the SHINE turnine spins at makes it look like a fan, which isn’t promising for the reality of it.
This type of program is gratefully awesome!

I've never heard a popular YouTuber make a joke about 'being wet'. Fair play.
Who the HELL is having a 25minute shower!?????
Just some constructive feedback it’s pronounced al-jhee not al-gee
It is not a bright idia
7:26 "makes elephants monetisable, thus reducing the incentive to kill them" jesus christ
Trees are important for other reasons but I think that there should be algae planting initiatives since that produces 80% of our oxygen.
You’ve let yourself down here Arun. I like your videos but dressing as a saviour and relating it to tech is very disrespectful to Christians
Stop using jesus, if u don't have to then done, please don't
I went to a Italian restaurant and the straw was hard pasta
imagen ordering a tent then starting last of us
The thing with the shower is that it looks really cool in theory. But with marking the drops really small and fast, it cools incredibly fast. So you end up having it really close or really hot which would be either uncomfortable or just straight up defeat the purpose of saving hot water
currently
currently
Algeeeee
I don't understand the second item on this list... "It can store liquid personal care products but the minute they are finished they can be used for soap." How is it used for soap?
yay!
There's a Problem with Plastic Roads & That's Microplastic Particles Microplastic Particles are micro particles of plastic that are released by Plastic (especially Plastic at contact with Water) We don't know much about it at the moment Only that around most of the Human's Population should already be contaminated by it
9:07  Imagine you're in Arizona😂
6:47 That's what she said.

May Jehovah guide everyone to the real truth Amen.
The fact that #2 was a core part of TeamTrees makes it a lot more special to me
are you dressed like Julius Caesar?
Most of these inventions are useless and stupid and will never be viable in the real  capitalist world. Maybe he should do a video about how he's gonna recycle all his mobile phones he collects.
14:45  turns out that is $10,000
The vegan thing is like a virus for me that i have a imunety
Live in Malaysia, unable to find any of these product
Can I get one of these drones for my house plants which keep dying?
im going to say this right now  i suport vegans but there are somethings we have to look into. nervous, skeletal, and immune system impairments, hematological disorders, as well as mental health problems due to the potential for micro and macronutrient deficits.
Plastic roads are a bad idea as it just increases the leaching of micro plastics into the environment
Vegan leather is not like the real thing. And it's not saving any animals. Useless garbage product. Leather is already a waste product.
Bro said he was feeling wet 😂
Yo check out wastea it’s leather out of tea I know the person who made it but it’s leather made out of tea and it’s the first in the world I can get you in touch with the owners if you wanna make a vid about it
i really don't like the countdown of each thing
Only Jesus can save the world, stop this blasphemy
whilst I think Xiaomi did awesome with the mushroom packaging, it also sounds like a friggin environmental biohazard lol
Really great videos but the rating system is confusing to me. Why is the fungus packaging only 4/10?
More of these pleaseeeee
Nooooo, I wanted to buy the wheat plates but they don’t sell them in the USA
it's not al-GEE it's al-JEE YOU HERE ME?! (I still think your videos are amazing BTW).
No i love pork bacon
mealworms!
Those editable plates are just different flavour from the plastic ones so not that useful
Fun fact cows aren’t killed for leather production , they use the hides from the cows used from beef since their hides are technically a waste product only like 5 percent of leather is made from cows killed for that purpose
Ever Heard Of Superworms?. They Are Basically Large Superworms And They Eat EVERYTHING! “Zophobas Morio” Are Their Scientific Name.
RICKROLL 7:10 😂😂😂

Mr. beast should have been in #1
Yep the air ink really looked like air😂
I find the paper straw issue to be a bit overblown myself. All you need to do is take the straw out when you're not using it or leave the tip of it sticking out of the straw holder and it lasts way longer.
Team green
I have a wind tree system that is close to my house it’s just like a 10 minute walk to there.
What happens if it falls in the shower or gets wet?😂😂 1:21
hey, you gonna finish that plate?
No matter how much plastic we recycle, it will still be plastic.😅
if Rwanda banned ALL single use plastics, why can't America?
lol the julio cesar shirt is horrendous haha. thanks for the content
I’ve been somewhere with flavored edible straws that you can eat after your drink and they don’t melt and taste good
For toilet paper thing just use towels and bidet
Blasphemous
he says "country called europe"
The soap bottle is a good idea until the truck carrying the shipment is rained on. Oops the whole shipment has melted.
3:37 my family has these straws made of chocolate so when you are done drinking something you can eat it
Arter the tree drone after u said a whole series (SIRIes) my iPad siri responded 😂
Mrwhosetheboss got the best tech tops in the world
6:47 thats what she said
Bro keeps speaking facts
His dress tho 😂  And I love the editing in this video
the plates come with plastic packaging
10:43 Villager man
ok that soapbottle... i need it like now!
1:08 it said Liar lol 😂
I was eating ..and the worm got me full😅😅
I have glass straws
You should mention the prices
At 6:49 , thats what she said
How do you save a cow with fake leather when that is a by product after it is turned into burgers?
The Bioybrid chandelier may take carbom dioxide out of the room but thats only during day and it will take oxygen during night which might cause sufforcation
How dare you compare this with god fear God in yourself  (وَٱتَّقُوا۟ یَوۡمࣰا تُرۡجَعُونَ فِیهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِۖ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفۡسࣲ مَّا كَسَبَتۡ وَهُمۡ لَا یُظۡلَمُونَ) [Surah Al-Baqarah 281]  It means  Beware of a Day when you will be returned to God: every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and no one will be wronged.  (فَذَرۡهُمۡ یَخُوضُوا۟ وَیَلۡعَبُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ یُلَـٰقُوا۟ یَوۡمَهُمُ ٱلَّذِی یُوعَدُونَ) [سورة الزخرف ٨٣ ] It means Leave them to wade in deeper and play about, until they face the Day they have been promised.
You do realise that as soon as these products designed to stop us killing cows, pigs, sheep, etc by totally replacing everything we get from them to save their lives will basically bring these, species to an end and make them extinct. Tell me who's going to feed animals that no longer make them money. The day we no longer need them for anything every heard will be slaughtered and burned in big piles. We'll be left with a few, of each probably In zoos as if we just release them 90% have absolutely no instinct to keep themselves safe. Goats a few, sheep and I guess milk cows might make it through but otherwise....
The greek god
27 vitamins 40grams protein andits made of of plastic
Lets be real.. its impossible for that drone to plant 20000 trees in one single day, its impossible. On day has 1440 minutes, this drone cant plant a tree every few seconds and plus watter it, impossible.
I feed mealworms to my lizards when I could be using them to eat my plastic waste lol
For the plate one i wonder if there is a gluten free version
scientists recently developed leaves that GLOW when they synthesize,  that would make the lamp you were talking about a lot more energy efficent!
for 15 we take the cow kill it then get leather
ik its out of topic but samsung is better change my mind IPHONE USER
With the 20th item are you a robot because you cought the soap bottles with no reaction or problem
I audibly gasped at so many of these. Amazingly Well done by the people who go about creating and discovering these solutions.
rickroll at 7:14 on the paper
All plates are edible if you aren't a coward.
The cat was like:you are still recording?
Honestly the majority of these things are absolute gimmicks. The soapbar bottle especially.
All of these advances need to be implanted now before its too late!
you know paper companies plant 20000 trees IN THREE DAYS!!! (I do not work in a paper company)
If it takes all of the non visible light from the electromagnetic spectrum, then how would all of technology work? Isn't all information you send out through your phone, computer, etc sent through radio waves to cell towers? So then if its taking in all of the electromagnetic spectrum except for visible light then none of our communication would work.
Cool but how much does it cost, salvation of our planet comes at a cost you know
People think godly is more than divine, thing is DIVINE MEANS GODLY OR GODLIKE
12:43 when being used they literally break down as you use them so plastic is going in the air yay
Not sure if I remember correctly, but the same type of mushroom from 20 is used to create vegan-bacon, which is supposedly very good.
Finally it isnt tech fail 😂
Vegan leather... don't you mean just... fake leather?
“21 inventions that will save the world” the thumbnail: gay shower hehehehe
Number 18 feels like that one robotic tree in the Lorax
People worry to much about the planet, we need to evolve and survive. Having living buildings might backfire. But We need straws. What about protein from animal byproducts. Being a vegan only affects your diet. We need water. We need wood, that’s bad quality paper. That fan would break small houses. No the fire goes to our food. That house can’t fit my family. Stop ignoring the quality and the tradition. We need to travel and get protein. No air appears, again we need wood. We need to go invest in solar panel. We need to be able to see through windows. It’s a liquid so it’s not food, it’s a drink.
He really rickrolled us with PooPaper™?
14:27
WOW
i use to live next to rick
no need to power up again with that box
Ohh my God I just saw rickroll at the poo paper at 6:50 poo paper
nothing will make me regain my faith in humanity besides all the rainbow people and furries burning brutally infront of every man and woman in this world and all the genders besides male and female dissapearing
This will save the world! Shows spinning leaves  growing on a tree and a rainbow shower: That outa do it
Would have loved it if he wore a dhoti kurta
NAWT PINAPWES
It’s pronounced britenhuber you allmost don’t hear the e
10:57 the only plate you ever ate
Are you vegan?
Algee
And it's not plastic either 😅
There's also an organism that has evolved to eat plastic
GG
You said that there are no downsides to the wheat bran plates.  There's one big problem for coeliacs.  If I used that plate (not even eating it) I would need plenty of elephant poo paper and that atomising shower... (TMI?)
I'm a big advocate for nuclear power because  1 it's way more efficient than the greenhouse gas emitting plants like coal or oil  2 it's even in the short term safer than coal and oil because modern nuclear power plants use a helper element usually a small amount of plutonium and the main element usually thorium which is as fissile   3 the only parts of it that can be used for nuclear weapons is the small amount of helper material which is an extremely small amount so it can even be placed in the more dangerous places in the world like Somalia, south sudan, Afghanistan, Etc.  4 when you think of nuclear energy most people think of the disasters such as three mile island and Chernobyl but those catastrophes were caused by HUMAN error such as leaving a sticky note on an important screen covering it up and at the same time ignoring the several other sensors telling them to drop the rods so it stops creating energy basically what I'm saying is let the computers deal with it since they don't make huge errors like people

actually plastic roads have a solution to 3 problems, in arizona where I live  roads are a real problem in the summer time bc the black asphalt reflects to heat back to the cars and the cars reflect it around the city and then in downtown areas the heat is excruciating sometimes because of all the tall business buildings. The city has been working on changing all asphalt roads to pavement but that becomes especially dangerous during monsoon season because wet pavement is very slippery to tires. I feel like if plastic roads have a good grip on wet tires then maybe it'd be the perfect solution for mine and all other cities with hot climates
It’s pronounced yaw-na Bryan-ten-hoo-bear 1:12
we live on an island surrounded by water, it rains for 70% of the year, we do not need to save water in the uk, it really doesn't matter.
This video gave me some hope for planet Earth until I found that the number 12 shower is at $450 on Amazon
'Planting'  a tree is ALOT different then just dropping seeds on the ground though.  Js
13:35 thats not milk :D
this video made my day i swear
good
It’s nice that the Netherlands have two of them
One place in Sri Lanka also makes poo paper and no im nor Sri lankan
Wait the planet might die 21 times?
You’ve made tons of short people happy
This restored my sensitive manatee.
I use metal straws pls reply to me
8:44 wow
Mealworms be like: I'ma go save the world by eating plastic.
The one won’t save the world, it just makes the process more complicated. The amount of energy spent is much higher than making clothes from scratch. The carbon footprint of that recycled clothing is massive relative to the new one. The best thing is to buy a new clothing and just burn the plastic bottles for energy. That’s how you really save the planet.  The soap bottles are also a bad idea considering they require way more space to store them before packaging the shampoo or whatever is put into it.  Meaning you need a bigger warehouse which translates to a bigger land use and less for plants to grow.  You need to think
Bro made the video so good that I even enjoyed the sponsor
you can't convince me saying that fake ass bacon is as good as the real thing looks like shoe leather
the issue with most of these is our current society and industry will prevent their spread. many companies make money by collecting garbage, or selling electricity. if anyone can produce their own electricity, then those companies will disappear, which they do not appreciate it
13:37im lactose intolerant 😂😂😂
Ok the one that has been on the one that has been on the one that has been on the one that 😢 has been on the one that has been on the one that has 5 years ago and I just got the one that I was going to get to do the same as the first thing to 5:17
Pretty much every video he make on the title it says world
Nah France trying to recreate the lorax with those trees
14:48 it kinda sounds like a undertale song
Yeah, abaut the meal worms.I have a bearded dragon (Australian lizard) that eats meal worms,and I keep them at home in a plastic container and they made a hole in it.
Were can I buy 15
1:02 the catch
I have an easier and better solution to plastic straws. Just use your mouth
Yup he did
10:31 have u heard of metal forks and plates made of marble
My classmates eating poop paper
“Im feeling wet already”  AYO
now the cow skin gets wasted instead. my guess is that the leather is made as a byproduct, probably not worth it to kill a cow just for leather. leather and meat.
I like the tiny house😃
hear me out. if goverment would just focus on these things we could have gas cars in future haha 😂
can I have the house?
Devily
I'm a meatatarian and I think that you should eat plants cause they have right plant life matters plant life matters PLM
Platic roads ? What about the micro plastic they will shred by degrading ?
Honestly took me a few minutes to realize you were saying Algae 😂 great video man I stumbled uppn your content yesterday and already binged for hours
The word algae does not have a hard g.  It's Al Gee.  It's not just humans having to change our habits to adapt to new technologies that makes them difficult to initialize, but the cost.  I'm constantly seeing things like facon for instance, that don't really taste like bacon I'm sure, and cost three times as much or more than the real thing.  I'm all for saving the planet.  I have water barrels, I recycle, I ride a bike most places that I go etc...  But when you start hitting me in the wallet, that's where I have to draw the line.  I was watching a Shark Tank episode where the people were making underwear that was compostable.  When it finally wears out, you throw it in your compost heap (for the probably .01% of people that actually have a compost heap), and it biodegrades over a few months.  Oh, and it costs nearly $30 for one pair.  Really?  So your solution to a non-existent underwear problem is to make something that is 5 times more expensive, and relies on the customer having a compost pile to really make your plan work?  Now the clear solar panels?  That sounds amazing.  Replacing all my windows with solar panels makes perfect sense.  Even at a higher cost, I would eventually recoup that cost by generating my own electricity.  Unfortunately, solutions that make that much sense are few and far between.  Out of the 21 you featured here, only a few made any sense.  The tree planting drone and the clear solar panels.  2 out of 21.
Guys i think that the future that people want is coming (when flying cars are coming?)
That wind tree gives me hardcore dystopian future vibes.
Its called PETase, and if its dissolved in water and plastic is soaked in it, it will be dissolved.
Would’ve been perfect if he said back In my icloud for no. 21
Bro accidentally swapped his dry cleaning with jesus😂
Why he dressed as a romanian emperor
This could solve the plastic crisis. 9/10
Just use of metal straw that just carry that around in your
Why dis religious? Seriously!?
2023 we fine guys
then just put plastic enzymes in humans so we could eat plastic
then just put plastic enzymes in humans
then just put plastic enzyms
1:36 i really xiaomi goood phones good airbuds and good tech
Nobody noticed the "thats what she said" hidden in the clouds.
Wait you throw away your plates
If your vegan and you want beans the farmers have to kill any animals that tires to eat your beans
"still the most tastiest plate I've ever had"  bros acting if he eats plates for a living. 💀
Such an nformative video!!! ...and all the work (and humor) you put into the video(s) make them great to watch!!  Thanks for keeping us informed on all of these great inventions...that will hopefully help save the planet one day!!!
Im using a Xiaomi
Love how you tried to make the video as realistic as you can,I really do appreciate it but please don't wear those clothes,not trying to be a hater but those clothes are kinda offensive towards Christians since this a replica of what Jesus wore before getting tort3red and crucified
that what 4:09
he really likes to write "that's what she said", saw it in this vid  a couple of times now
You have tik tok
I don't like the way you loo
15:20 layers and layers of solar panels, omg
His poo paper has Rick Asley on ii
His right hand on the thumbnail is sus.
Soon there won't be any plastic in the ocean that these companies will be able to use (cuz it's gonna be gone)
cool vid nice initiatives but we can solve basically all those problems but eliminating capitalism. we have to surpass capitalism in order to save the planet
0:05
Hi
BACON IS SOOOOOOOOO NOT HALAL
10:31 why is he eating a plate?
i have enough this eco bull shits
Don’t dress up as (Jesus if it’s supposed to be him) bro don’t say dat at the start either no name or
This was the most interesting and most relaxing seventeen minutes of my life
I actually ate some of the poo paper
😊😊😊
cut my shower time by three minutes? that would be in the negatives
actually 400 years not 500 years
Some soap is apparently better than 31 billion less plastic bottles in the ocean, in addition to some cool clothes.
Vegan bacon. what the heck
Can we just take a moment to appreciate- this video is cool and thats final
70000000th
Mrbeast gotta step it up bro 14:27😂
the inventor of mealworms should get a nobel prize
how many trees are used  to make toilet paper? the solution is to go backwards to the year 100AD. The romans did not used Toilet paper. and up to 1800, no toilet paper. We are perverts in history? rubbing our arses with paper? with chemicals? and giving ourselves conditions like haemeroids.  The Roman soldiers used a sponge. they rinsed it out. and reused it.  Or they used a wet cloth. this would last weeks. They did not shove trees down a water hole? that's what we do. all those wet wipes? paper sludge?   a pkt of ten sponges costs 50p.  Toilet paper is a lot more expensive. and damages the environment. People panic when they run out of TP?   anyone in the great outdoors hauling a pallet of toilet paper with them is insane. Arctic explorers?  Mountain climbers?   the be-day shoots water up it. and you do not need reams of paper to polish your arse cheeks.   The simple sponge can save the forests.
4:41  at this point I got a bacon breakfast McDonald’s advert 😂
These vegan meats are great for me as I eat non-veg but there’s many meats that I can’t eat but really want to try. I love your channel so much. Keep it up ❤
Imagin going to a public place and eating on the plate and after you finish eating it you eat the plate right infront of everyone
I have a shower that can do the same thing as number 12. Tho the drops get very cold. So I wouldn't recommend
Little did you know I’m lactose intolerant 13:38
😊😊
Bwowo
Imagine spending years to make a building that helps both the ecosystem and electricity problems, only for paper made of elephant sh*t to be rated more by a british guy dressed up like jesus
Can you plz make a video on the Lexus hoverboard? (BTW I have a tech channel called esTech-im not very popular can you shout me out?)
Wonder if he actually wears this dress in normal life casually and walks around the streets.😂😂😂
i think people need to realise that there is more to ecosystems than just trees, plus planting just one type of tree in large areas leads to monocultures which are not healthy
Super fun fact: planting trees gives you real peredies
I don't eat vegan food becuase of two reason  1. i love the taste of meat 2. Most vegan products are mostly made with soy and if you only eat vegan food a big part of your diet would be soy and soy has a lot of sodium in it
Earth worms aren’t an invention.
The facon from breaking bad
4:06 that's what SHE SAID!
you are not god stop trying to look like hem!
12:50 alle nederlanders.. blijkbaar gebruikt de efteling dit haha
"Mom can we have Jesus?" "No son we have Jesus at home" Jesus at home :
Imagine if your house gets hacked tho
the minecraft Create mod devs are already using dried kelp as conveyor belts
But while making the things it still polute
Mrwhosetheboss give us another video like this but more up to date
Me
I LOVE that you put vegan articles in there. Non-Vegan lifestyle has such an immense impact on our world. Thats nice
Maybe a scientist 😅
yeah they can save the world but almost all of them are not available in every country bruh
10:55 “Still the tastiest plate I’ve ever had.” This implies that he has eaten a plate once before.
The simpleness of these ideas, the result of their usage, and his Wardrobe make this video a must-watch.
7:17 I'm curious on how you can accidentally find this out 😂
Why algggea. It's pronounced aljea
I give all 10/10
you say algae wrong
We can use material that absorbs only uv ray so it will be transparent to our eyes because it will let visible light to pass though it. Maybe this is how we could make transparent solar cell, just an idea.
All 10/10
bro What are you wearing
for num 8 i saw it and was like ok well in my survivalist and tech savvy self the only thing now it needs is a rain water filter and low and behold im buying that shit for my suvivalist self
@Mrwhostheboss - what happened to your arm??
Nah bro, if you have seen the 1998 Godzilla series, you know what happens when you modify worms.
someone should invent a door wich makes energy when someone poens it
how tf can a rainbow shower save the world 😭😭😭😭
Been better if 3yrs ago
I love mushrooms
Go back to treasure video
What religion are you I thought that you were Muslim! You ate fake bacon 😳
Awesome
As someone who prays for us and the earth to start getting our shit together to help give back to the environment, and someone who enjoys tech, this video hits me in the feels.
Anyone else got a ad from arun? About opera. (Im watching this is opera lol
Arun out of context: "He literally comes the very second we stop recording"
Just use a metal straw
Some people cannot go vegan because the body won't allow them but some people very good with vegan
Arun one of those inventions is you
If you burnt the poo paper would it smell bad??
CAN YOU DO HISTORI OF FARMING SIMULATOR
In Germany we also got rid of the old straws
Bro I imagine you’re at Disneyland waiting in line and you see this 8:19
Im feeling wet just because im thinking of it 💀💀💀
i got rickrolled
And again and again and again 😂
@Mrwhosetheboss wait how do you know its the tastiest plate you've ever had? wait a minute....
Stevia is known to cause Infertility (just wanted to let you guys know as a warning about the sweetener inside the sponsor).
Mrbeast
Can we live without expensive kearher bags ?  Cold or hot water bottles ?
All these are all awesome inventions but there's also the carbon foot print they leave behind
thats accually so crazy
why didn't you mentioned Bitcoin? It is one of the most promising invention we have. You only understand that if you do research but "fix the money fix the world" is true. Maybe you can do your own research and then dedicate a whole video to it?
Did any one notice the she said joke
Yeah the paper companies replant most of the trees they cut down. It's literally been a law since the seventies I believe.
1:50 @mrwhosetheboss ca i eat it
*literally takes out 31 billion bottles from the ocean* 2/10
Nice
you could use the glas over the solar plates and generate twice as much energy while takin half the space
6:47 no way he just said that 💀
2:20 you can see he is holding on for dear life💀
Hey mrwhostheboss I have a lunch box made of plastic bottles, the brand is called shmash
Now this is redeeming most company's and restoring my hope in humanity thank Mrwhosetheboss for this
i like corn
Will the plastic rodes make micro plastic though small parts braking apart
wind tree system is not good what if animals get on it like bats spiders birds and other things they can break the stuff
❤❤
nice fit👍
Bro I found Jesus' YouTube channel
5:52 u mean per sec 😂
DOLE is a department of philippines it means department of labor employment
I officially hate this dude. Stop it this instant
How can a f****** box be better than a jacket
I love this video and the plans to make the world a better place but the only thing I don't like is the fact that some people want every human on the planet to abandon meat because that is what humans are made to eat we aren't meant to only eat veggies producta.
Nice sh*t paper
I love spending $10,000 a day
in y house i got metal straws that i can wash them and use again
“The room you’re in” Me in a car 😬
4:05 ayo
13:28 thos fuckers ate through five books and and a plastic box when they got container
Most of these are genius but kinetic energy absorbing tiles, that’s genius
Wow it’s already been a year
Saving water is dumb a lot of water goes back to the water cleaning plant (i forgot how it was called) .Btw all the water on earth never left earth aka we all drank a water that went thru T-Rexs
The vegan leather thing is a bit of an issue , as it would require the entire meat industry to disappear to be useful, as if we had both vegan leather and the meat industry, the real leather would get tossed/burned, making a bigger impact than if just the small leaves were burned.
The pollution ink marker thing didn't do anything on the paper as far as I can see...
Algee haha
Just asking he goes to the bacon does like 10 more inventions and I want to ask, how long does your bacon take to cook
How is this a year old already
Thw shower one you could just fill up a bucket which would limit your water usage
감사합니다.
hi
13:35 "oh btw i got u a glass of milk" Him "Thanks" *drinks and realizes that isn't in fact milk*  Bro that scene had me dying
Do you wanna swear again you’re going to be a few 8:00
Damn yall taking 25 minute showers
bro i was eating my dinner
i got always rickrolled
Bro Did you found out about it today
im so sorry ur cat scratched u on ur forearm
I really like your dress here.
How do I make my own YouTube channel
Smart 🧠 in
if the package is mushroom can i eat it?
Wait is this shark tank?
Me seeing the title:the most life saving one is how I will try to kill myself to prove everyone wrong XDD 😅😂😂😂😂
cool
About the paper thing, the paper industry replants them to more or thes same of what they took
based on the government recommendation i shouldnt shower 🤣🤣
21 more like 19
He’s like 5/10! So good! Almost 10/10
Although the poo paper would take away a dung beetles ball of poop
The way he just ignored the vibrator in the Xiaomi box is funny
Man no matter what I am sticking to the real bacon
COW FARTS ARE NOT HURTING THE ENVIRONMENT! 💩💩💩 ONLY HURTS THE NOSE!!!👃🐽🤥
This was your best video ever.
In a metal capsule for camping, lived my ancestors in their 'stone age'. A thing like this needs big batteries for storage, that aren't the best option under the weather like rains. It would need a HUMMER EV by the side for working properly, which is stupid, 'cause you can live just so in a HUMMER EV. hahahahahahaaha
That’s a little bit salty
So that's what off worlders have in mind for us?     Guaranteed destruction.
imagine you receive a love letter on poo
put windmiles in Belgium and you have infinite power
shandelure was the name of that pokemon
Awsome
I have an solar powered powerbank.
Is the box edible.
eat your clothes it have better taste👽
Honestly most of these look like scams... Either that or they're very poorly designed from an engineering perspective.
Al - gee ✋
Bro should be a comedian 😂
we dont "waste water", the water will just go where it goes, and evaporate.
💀AllGie💀
Many of these sound like there are major hidden flaws. Plastic waste, though hard to degrade, can be easy to deform or shred among other things. It is also toxic so it might contaminate storm water flowing out.
😁
13:35 Imagine having lactase enzymes 😂😂 (I’m lactose intolerant)
Bro the 1st one imagine if they teamed up with team seas that's a lot of clothes
Damn the world hating on the vegan teacher when they are doing what she says (everyone is becoming animal rights activists) And making paper out of elephant poop is unhygienic
NOT ONE A 10/1O!!!!!!!!!WHAT THE HE*K
What a coincidence I was looking at repreve clothes while watching this video
nice vid! but huel sucks, its says you must pay 75$ before ordering, the mininum i can order is 75$ -_-
6:14 he said "Imagine 1000 glasses in the room your in right now" and I'm like " Bro I'm in a Fricking Cheesecake Factory I think they could fit lol"
15:49
😂
Great and super important and reassuring video
Fungus and mould should. Not be in the same sentance
7:14 wow I love this part 😆
14:02 habeetat
The plastic road isn't gonna work because not only can you not remelt many plastics(and how would you sort for that) , but many of them don't have good(safe) grip characteristics plus are not durable. Ashphalt can be remelted infinitely so it is already quite an eco-friendly material.
First time liking a vegan's idea
Thanks, jesus:]
Not Mrwhosethboss talking about planting trees and not talking about Team Trees
😍
Bqq fusion ?? Or you can just put a lid on your bbq…..
Paper could and/ are also generated by using (used sugarcane pulp) after making sugar.
As soon as as he said these shampoos are not mine I promise a message appeared at 1:08
Wait, what if we put the energy saving glass onto phone screens?
Vegan is being an idiot you don't eat nutrients and your not helping the environment by building more useless products just be vegetarian
im vegen and i eat facon all the time
These do be good though 👌👍
On the no 10 shine, i have a solar powered power bank, isn’t that better?
Man these ideas are worse for environment and people themselves, no wonder why they didn't take off, plastic roads? What the hell are u even saying how's that good the whole reason people hate plastic is because it degrades overtime and breaks down to such small particles that it ends up in underground waters and then when you drink it it ends up in you while hurting your health
Alge
Team seas is doing that to taking stuff out of the ocean😊
0:07 goofy ahh intro music💀💀💀☠☠☠☠💀💀💀☠☠
This video is about helping the world but then you mention disgusting vegans? Pls you seem smart but that is the dumbest thing I have heard in awhile. Vegans do worse for the planet than good tf? Us natives have been trying to tell you ppl this so much yet no one listens 😭 not only is the entire concept of vegans racist and classist but by only eating plants not only are they harming the planet but they are also making the chance of overpopulation higher. Bad for the environment for both those things actually because overpopulation of animals can be exstreamly bad for multiple environments,animals and the entire food chain. Over population of animals can lead to extinction of other animals,less plants WHITCH IS AGAIN A HUGE PROBLEM WITH VEGANS TOO(less plants means planet go oof in simple terms),the world fucking up more cause again,too many animals and more. And as for the plant thing, vegans being here means that more plants are being eaten than what usually would be consumed. Meaning not only do they put plant species in danger but they also run the risk of eating already endangered plants. We already take too many plants and shit from the earth and it is already causing so many problems but if vegans continue their dumbass bs than it will just get worse and cause more problems than good. In fact literally nothing good comes from vegans. They are bad for the environment,are classist,racist and in general they serve absolutely no good purpose. I absolutely despise these ppl and those who support them are absolutely disgusting
7:17 What is printed on his paper? Looks like Rick Astley
Do milatary techs next vid 🔫🔫
Like the enzymes that help you break down milk  Lactose intonations : shockethed
For number 2 i think 7,300,000,000 trees will be planted in a decade correct me if i am wrong
??¿?¿
poop paper was first made in Sri Lanka
6:56
Sir u said 20k trees a day and thats cool and all. But 50 cents a tree means €10k a day! Who will ever do that? And even the cost of that drone will be around 400 dollars So again i dont think anyone will do that. (Except Mr.Beast)
I disagree with the vegan part.
16:02 and... vitamin D is there? 😁  So very nice you put in this compilation, as always ofc. Cheers man!
biljon is miljon
Transparent solar can be a big issue too , if it absorbes waves of wavelength other than visible light than it will interfere infrared and microwaves and radiowaves which are not in the visible range  And especially in urban cities transparent solar can lead to many many problem  Btw amazing content
i hate mrwhosetheboss
Great vid
Nice
THE GAY SHOWER
Adidas is also doing the same
I love how he got a rickroll in every video
When I watched for the third time I realized there was plastic packaging on something meant to help, the wheat bran plate is harmful but helpful mostly helpful
Him: we would need to hire an entire army to plant trees  Me: mR bEaSt?
ur mom says : honey eat my plates
plastic road is a ridiculous scam.  go watch thunderfoot's video on it
"Green initiative" "Let's completely abandon meat" bro if you want to have more "green" stop eating vegetable. the one with green color in it is vegetable not meat
Bruh "reusable straw" seriously why don't you just stop being fancy and drink from the cup
Mr whose the boss takes a bite out of his plate before eating his bacon 😂
12:21 the problem with plastic roads is that when it's gets used and  scratched it releases micro or nanoplastics. Better to use it at something else like clothes or electronics.
Mrwhosetheboss is different than most tech channels as the thumbnails look like extreme clickbait, but the content always delivers more than expected.
Wait… Why are pineapple leaves burned? Aren’t they bio degradable? Can they not be used for composting?
Sometimes i wonder if people and influencers like you actually do something to help
you are so .......for me
He lost me at #14 ... fake bacon? No thanks
(Al-gee) not (al-gi)
Ecocapsule's price has already skyrocketed to 100.000€, double the cost you said in this video. Also, it's apparently only for mid-term housing. Looks/sounds great but the most expensive thing of a "house" is the terrain, and once you've bought it, you have to spend the amount of money of a real house, to live in a tiny space, and not for the rest of your life.  Cool concept, but way too expensive and non-reliable
Your video,s were nice now they are boring
when i went to KSP, I saw a bunch of charging tiles, and the energy would go into rocket production
Algi💀
Veganism for men makes them loose testosterone and they can stop being attracted to women 😬
Did you know that you can have a mouth straw to drink anything
I thought he was about to turn into the vegan teacher 😂
The Plastic straws campaign was such a greenwash - they themselves apparently can’t be recycled & the actual impact of them vs other plastics was vastly oversold when it was a few percent vs other sources which polluted more  Ofc if you can use an alternative (not pepper though) but it also took no consideration for the disabled who can’t use metal etc. and relied on the plastic straws
the stupid thing is that we have to kill animals otherwise they overpopulate and cause major problems so thats why we meat lovers eat meat
Brother I like what you show but please heed this it is not wise for anyone to even remotely make fun even if you think it is just BCF friendly banter of God nore Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit please Brother repent and give God who gave you life who dies on the cross for you and every other human being and give him the respect he deserves. God bless and keep you
It is Al-gee that is how it is pronounced
Damn how you caught the soap bottles
The edible cutlery from another inventions video and edible plates here with wheat listed as an ingredient in both makes me wonder if the makers chemically removed the gluten or if they just expect people who can't digest gluten to still eat off of other "disposable" tableware.
Nope people still suck
Isn't Divine and godly the same thing
Nice
ME: Huel looks cool! Huel: 98 dollaroos for two bags of plant powder please "what"
These windows are (too lazy to explain) 9/10
Hey where's the link for that shower head that you showed?
Vegan food can't sustaine a full-grown man .. and kids need the protein
You know these are good when even the last place is good
Wait so it takes 1200 dollars per day .       🧠 👁️👅👁️👂        🫀        🫁
5
The drone would cost about 10,000 us dollars per day.
You pronounced Arup wrong
For the algee Me💀
I was eating a banana 🍌 and when you mentioned “Poo Paper” I lost my appetite
i drink 100 glasses of hot water every day
"That vegan teacher" would love this video
anyone else norice he said im feeling wet just thinking about it before poo paper
I'm a Muslim I can finally try bacon due to fakon
Did i just got rick roll
Facon="vegan bacon" dym fake bacon
7:09 Hahahahaha
if i would have ecocapsule and pavegen id fuse them together so i get extra energy
It's said aljy not algy
Do the coolest nerf blaster
fun fact: there is paper that is waterproof and tear resistant but can still be cut with scissors because that paper is made of STONE
A vegan diet cannot be sustained without supplements witch are unregulated in the us, the main problem is with B12 as most plants don't make it, it is important for making stuff like blood cells to nerves, also I think it is an oil witch most plants don't make I mean like have you seen a meaty veggie/fruit, didn't think so, I believe that we should eat more fish as it is healthyer and is more sustainable, that and chicken, you could also go on a vegetarian diet witch has less environmental impact then straight up meat but that doesn't mean it would be easy especially since it requires a lot of will power to even stay on such a diet, food is food, here in America we need better food practices, some is on the government/farmers and the other is with us as like many of us can't handle the food we are putting in us, with this it is because food companies want you to eat their food and so they will do anything legal and sometimes illegal to get you to eat what they want you to eat
That one kid that likes to eat paper 💀💀
about point 4. you should first have read about microplastics... basically yes it's good to reuse plastic but if you use it as a road every little small plastic piece that will chip from the road will go in the air. A.K.A. polluting our environment with microplastics that indeed as you said yourself last for 500 years.
my power bank charges itself
Ah la gee
?
Algy
Can we get the eco-capsule in the U.S.A
This is what science class should teach you.
wait am i gonna be turned into packaging
him: plates that the company wants to get rid of plastic tableware to save the planet. The plate wrapping: cardboard box with plastic seal around plates. XD hope I'm not the only one who saw that
you are a goot person i like you videos you must got 20,M ABONNEES PLS LIKE EVERRY BODA AND SUB!
That vegan teacher be like facpm resembles bacon x despicable
WE SHOULD  NOT EAT MEAT Then Why Are We Omnivores Huh?
Actually, a 1,000 glasses of water wouldn't fill a room. A 10 by 10 by 10 cube of glasses is 1,000 glasses of water, that doesn't fill a room; not at all. I'm not invalidating your statement though, it is true, but that part wasn't true.
WE HAVE CERAMIC PLATES WE HAVE PANS
WE HAVE METAL STRAWS
Sadly the ecocapsule has doubled in price!
What about the microplastics?
13:35 im lactose intolerant....
Seriously love your channel
me when animal not die to plastic but eat it: someone please make this an invasive species in junkyards or dumps
Wait I wanna say this that in your 17th inventions your !!!! Dress just came out!!!!!!!!!!!! That was a pretty sus in your video that makes me laugh
This is creative
Apart from carbon emissions being vegan isn’t helpful bc cows and other animals (mostly cows) will overpopulate and eating animals is meant to be done
6:47 "I'm feeling wet just thinking about it."
i had to subscribe because of this video 😅
I loved when Arun said "its heavenly gadger-ing time" i was flabbergasted. Truly heavenly gadgeting moment of all time
6:47 excuse me?
3:45 wait (no offense) but I didn’t know you were British
… writeing on shit…… emmmmmm I pass this one
this has restored my faith in humanity
The cows aren’t being saved it just means we have more clothes and leather gets burnt instead
meme:  Him: algi powered buildings  me: nah bro its the backrooms
bro for the wheat plates, just use metal plates, or plates of clay
@10:30      im asking my mom, whats the lunch      she says,just some  plates
This video made me want to buy a Jesus costume
A lot of those were gross but cool especially the Pooh paper
i had that shower head it was horrible🤷
Hey just saying, instead of staying “instead of filling up a landfill when you’re done you can eat it” you can say “instead of filling up a landfill when your done you can fill up your stomache”  Like omg I was expecting you to say that and was disappointed that you didn’t 😂
What religion are you arun?
Bacon is haram
Id like to know why someone would boil and dry elephant poo, discovery aside, they need help ASAP!
I actually have poo paper I got its from a little kit I got in 2019
Just use chinaplates
9:51 Mission: get it cooked completed
Kind of related but I use this chrome extension called Ecosia and it plants trees when you search.
oh cmon we all like the hot water
Glad I took out my DPF and EGR from my car :)
9:08 he made a dad joke 🤣
Scientists ae doing studies on meal worms to see if they can put them into landfills to eat the plastic,and when they eat thry poop,when they poop you can fertilize plant so another reason to put them into landfills.
TEAM TREES
Or u could just use a grill that closes 💀💀
your ranking was average
That is why I take baths
I am a cattle farmer we will be broke
S..
ha for a second i thought he said : "we have learned how to sling-shot children"  i was like : 0-0........ :)........0-0
1:08 @900care
I will still watch you but…  Get better puns 😂😂
Is he drunk or in drugs? He doesn't look stable in any of his videos
The thing runs off the sun so it’s a bright idea get it get it get it yeah OK
Props to all these companies
I literally dare you to find a better youtuber than Arun Maini. Thank you, man.
Arun is just the best youtuber ever
Hopefuly our sicnceist is not like the sinetist from stray
Does no one take upkeep maintanance and material sourcing into consideration when saving the planet? It seems most are just trying to market more junk.  Hasn't the use of paper been shown to actually be a carbon sink? But the e-ink tablets and generations of e-waste to replace paper is our solution? How?
A sub would be BRIGHT 😂
Arun: things are gonna get so much more awesome Next invention SOAP BOTTLES
This is the first time i saw arun litter😂
wow nice joke
they make this plate which is good for the environment then they wrap it in plastic, like bruh
Imagine one of these end up in his tech fail vids
My friend is just like Arun, he loves Rick Astley and his rick roll
i have got a schoolbag made of 50% plastic bottles
The eco plate whatevers are LITERALLY PACKAGED IN PLASTIC!
totally legit thumbnail
these companies need support to change the world
Idk why but the soap bottles look so eadible
1:37 💀💀💀💀
I only like gril
But y plastic🥺😢😭😭😭😱😱
BO,OH,OWER is better
Hmm I just got an idea  So what if you used the clear solar panel and use it for sunglasses that could charge your phone
13:35 AY AY AY STOP WRONG GLASS THAT MINE GLASS IT AINT MI-
All these talk about saving the planet, but the best way is to let's human do what we want, we very good at digging our own grave... The planet will survive the pollution but the we won't... Future looking bright without human..
Okay, also, when you atomize water like that it not only increases pressure it also rapidly cools the water.  So, where exactly does the carbon balance lie now?  Having to use hotter water so you can keep the same temp or using more water at a cooler temp?
I do like the toga!  😂. At least I think it’s a toga... Greek... Latin... it’s all... Mediterranean.
0:43 its impressive but think about how much is 30 billion there aren't that much people on the planet and think how much is still inside the water.
Who came from his short lol😅
6:01 me who spends  ten minutes standing in the shower rethinking my life choices:👁👄👁
Can you call please call at my convenience if I call can I get back in the car call you please please answer please please stop to stop please please stop to me please call please stop bye call please call call please stop to stop bye call please please stop bye bye call please call me please call please please stop please call please I AM JOKING!
3:55 They kind of blow, I'd say.
Arun:Burning emits harmful gases  Also Arun:Burns a firecracker
we also hae  paper made of rocks
wow ts like a solution to all world problems we have but we are too distracted, lazy and selfish to upscale all this ideas
leather was made for every piece of a cow to be used
From Devine to glorious to godly  Me “You know Devine and godly means pretty much the same thing.”
1:13 you actually pronoised alright the only thing that kind of sounded mit so tight was the u cuz you pronounced it like a "ü"
Does he live in the UK or the USA or neither as I’m confused
omg
All the people can’t digest lacktose 13:37
Any invention to help upcoming artistes achieve the dream
bro really picked a company that uses plastic when it is a eco friendly video 💀
Every body was kung fu fightin
Mom, i didn't eat the whole meal but I ate the plate. Is that good?
Repreve is literally a company made to support team seas
Suggest this video to@theveganteacher
I have one question is Huel vegan?
u do realise if u dont cut the tree, it will eventually "die" ? why not just plant ahead of time and cut older? the issue is that, some people conquer some countries pump out all the "money" and leave it be broken, so now people have to cut off rainforests to plant palm oil palms to produce some cash to "survive" i guess..
whats difference between divine and godly?
Rick Astley never gonna :give u up           Let u down
questionable content, 100% praise. the drone thing seems like a scam, like it can somehow water 20 thousand seeds in a day? and what of automation if it requires those humans to pilot it? was so close to subscribing to this channel too. give me an ounce of skepticism, a single mention that this sector of commerce is wrought with deception trying to take advantage of the eco-lazy. honestly would appreciate a reply
The solar panels were the best thing I’ve seen in my life
We should be focusing more on big companies that have made major packaging changes. Like m&ms, they use to use paper packaging, and now they use plastic! Why!?!
I mean the pineapple thing is kinda pointless. Leather is the same kind of concept. Cows aren't killed for leather, the leather is a product that would otherwise be wasted once a cow is butchered.
Since when are mealworms inventions? I guess I was wrong about them being animals…
Pure oxygen is toxic to humans and a alot other animals
Number 7: gluten free people🥲
i wish there where links to everything
Buying xaoimei from now on
Tastiest plate I've ever have?
Aight. I'mma make my class watch this in Individuals and societies. Perfect fit for our unit now
9:30 looks like a dragon ball house
secret message? "that's what"
No plastic straws wrapped in paper but paper straw wrapped in plastic😂
🤪🤪🤪🤪😠😠😠🥵🥵🥵🥵🫠🫠🫠🫠😅😅😅😅😅😢😢😢😢😢
The "that's what" wasn't so heavenly 😂
This was a really great video and he is the only person I like to watch but who has a 25min shower
I LIKED FOR THE ink-redible
Arun's catching skills are a 10/10
Undoubtedly the eco friendly air ink comes in a polluting plastic pen (?)
I gotta say bro i don’t know about the idea of writing on shit
This is another video about something I don't think about or look into in my normal day to day, but this is amazing stuff! Hope to see this type of video every year!
I'm allergic to coconut and stevia. If they have options WITHOUT those things, I'd be willing to give em a shot.
6:47 😀
🤨 6:47
never understood if your getting rid of straw just  just change the lid so you dont need one
ooooo
What if the building breaks down? What will happen to the algea?
And expensive
“ They look gorgeous 3/10” did it dirty
The world doesn't need saving. Humanity does, however. 🙄
Seriously??? Rickrolling on a tech review!!.?!?!? Okay that is smart
Combining 4 and 5, putting it on main roads... It would do wonders...
capsule-house 50k euro? My apartment 40m2 cost equal. I live in central street of city with population of 1,8 million. So its very expensive for capsule xD
4:16 just use a metal straw
fun fact algae are not plants they are bacteria
but huel is using a plastic bag
Ahhhh normal straw is also reusable 🙄🙄🙄
Amazing video
The thing I hate most is when restaurants use biodegradable straws but have them in a plastic wrappings. I like this reusable straw idea
al-gee? what do you mean al-gee?
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 tha's wat she sed
the only one i will never want is "Poo Paper" like im not gonna use paper made out of elephant shit
So 80 gallons per bath 👁️👄👁️
this is so gay what happens when everyone uses fake leather the leather from cows gets burnted therefore wastes VEGANS are GAY
Where can you get the power bank shine
Now this, it can save billions of lives and loads of nature. I'd give it a 4/10 to be completely honest.
Hold on the tastyst plate you've had yoo how many plates have you eat ok
2:56 algie 😳 jk love ur vids
the shower one is actually in europe already in a way. in poland we have mist machines for summer days that blast water mist. most people here in england and there have those taps that put air into the water for a softer experience and water saving
“They look the absolute BEST I love it so much! 2/10”
our country started making poo paper in 18s
I dont know how anyone has said this but.......                                         THERE IS 21 INVENTIONS                     ^^
“A self powered home”  Me: a home?
Huel was nice if is dosent cost 100 HAUNDRED DOLLARS FOR TO BAGS ARE YOU FREAKING CRAZY
hey, how much money do you make from youtube?
It funny because at the the end the heul bag is made of plastic
Ok, what are we going to do about water. Its going to run out someday, and its not a good thing
this makes me happy thankyou
What a god
It's kinda relaxing to hear there are still some people who care about this earth  most of the people are selfish and only think about them self not this planate and doesn't take global warming and other things seriously
So many of these are actually just Different Ways to Destroy The World. You've been lied to about your impact on the world. So many of these things just seem better for the world if you don't think about it
The plates trying to replace plastic and  paper plates are wrapped in plastic
Your mocking Jesus
I saw the wind tree thing at the Norwegian and Swedish border in dingle
“Ahahhh the world is warming” The same people the same day: Nevada 100° outside wrapped in a blanket with fire on and drinking hot chocolate
divine is godly
Vegan leather is not very useful in my opinion, cows are still gonna be killed for meat so why not just use the leather?
Arón: makes a video about ways to get rid of plastic  Aron: also promotores something that comes in plastic bags
Number one is getting there but what about animals because some may not be able to see it
Cool
you know what is ink-credible is the amazing terrible dad jokes
This video was very inspiring for me. Idk what else to say
I was eating then i got to the poop paper and i lost my appetite lol
BRO ARENT YOU MUSLIM DONT EAT BACON ARUN
We have edible straws here, they are made out of some kinda hard candy, tastes good with different flavors and doesnt leave any flavor while drinking from it
Better question why dont we use papyrus instead of trees?
Why is this actually restoring my hope in humanity like wtf
Why are people saying we need to stop eating meat. Humans aren't herbivores they're omnivores, and it's scientifically proven that humans who just eat vegetables live less than people who eat both.
They’re finally starting to make capsule corp irl
what sucks is that 7 was wrpt in plastic
i just realized that the 15 and 16 spots are switched
I really like these green environment littering free products
did i just got rickrolled by poo paper?
I have some poo paper
Im just here for Milo
Algae (aljii)
Watching These vids make me feel better
That usable soap bottle idea is really nice, BUT if they’ve got a patent copywrite on the design it will stop anyone else using the idea, thus making it less about saving the planet and more about profit..
Another fun fun fact most paper companies are extremely sustainable with their trees
Did you know oxygen is crosive
Vegan foods may seem good for you right now but eventually it will make the ecosystem unstable with all the things we normally eat being everywhere it will get out of control eventually
Its not
wow
the bad thing about number 7 is people with coeliac disease can't have wheat so it would cross contaminate their gluten free food
I do like the idea for number one, but can't some animals not see through them? I mean I guess it's a good and a bad thing, but I don't know.
Ok but fr who the fuck takes 25 minutes shower when 4 is largelly enough ?
God gave us animals for food for a good way vegans are evil
I was eating a bacon sandwich while you talked about facon
me who collects warhammer plastic models🤫
13:08
Hold on a minute, I saw that in the corner of the screen on product 16
Holy- I thought this would be a clickbait video, but it's quite the opposite... and it's a short video promoting just the right things! (also get the holy joke?)
i miself have made poo paper sevral times as a activiti at a brithday
the paper straw can be used easily just whenever your not drinking slide the straw up to where the water isnt touching it, it will not sog and rip when you do this
I got an ad for epidemic sound while watching your video
As wonderful as a lot of these are, for people with dozens of allergies, a lot of these would be pretty hard for us to use.
👍
Those window solar panels are genius, especially for down town in large cities with tens of thousands of windows on the skyscrapers. Now just wait till someone invents collar panel roads.
Was ist mit Deutschland
I know I shouldn’t…. But I laughed so much when I saw the costume in the beginning of the video 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The tastiest PLATE you ever had what do you mean have you eaten a plastic or ceramic plate before
Problem, wouldnt the meal worms eat the plastic roads?
Interesting video
Feed mealworms plastic, turn mealworms into food. We’re basically eating plastic. 🤣
There 8s also cactus leather
Arun -1000 glasses of water would probably fill every inch of space in the room your in    Homeless people- nice try 👌🏿
My respect for him:📈📈 The vegan teacher respect for him:📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
My credit card have mercy 😭😭
Wth
And some people make leather from cactus cool fact 😁
You spelled „Breitenhuber“ it better than every other English-speaking person I know
16:24
3:34  no. man's gift to mankind.
That last one though. That was boss man
Me being lactaid free: *sigh*
"still the tastiest plate i ever had" does that mean.....
package that you keep under shower that is made of soap? Haha
His titles are not clickbait, trust me
YAY NOW WE CAN BREATH HAPPY
this video should see every human alive, cuz then we may live till the year 3000
Everyone in the UK needs to have the Nebia Showerhead LOL
I want to ask questions that  Is motorola g company actually yours 🤔
oh is that mrwhosethegod?
Mrwhosetheboss: i can’t stress how cool the algae building is!  Also mrwhostheboss: 5/10  Also also mrwhostheboss: we are now in heavenly territory.  Also also also mrwhostheboss 6/10  Also also also also mrwhostheboss:self-powering house? 7/10 Carbon dioxide pen? 8/10
What. How did I get an ad BY Mrwhosetheboss that perfectly transitioned from the video. I just tripped so hard bro.
While I was watching this I got an ad that had Mrwhosetheboss lol. Anyways great video
he rated a world saving recycling company that reuses old junk to make clothing for those in need a 2/10 but then he rated a soap bottle 3/10 ??????
10:09 The irony... I've seen this a million times with those "green alternatives", let's reduce plastics! by replacing big bulky sturdy plastic things with clean green things wrapped in single use micro plastics!  the pod thing is probably one of those biggest "green washing" thing, the thing is neat, but at the same time it's full of gallium and cobalt, something rather not so damn green or Eco friendly if 7 billion people had to use them.
Is anyone talking about how he just did an anti pollution thing then the sponsors bag is made out of plastic
4th felt like quite sketchy, am I the only one that thinks like "the moment sun hits it, wont it pollute other ways such as air?" or the stored water passes through the plastic, we don't use the water bottles that was under sun bec it contains plastic in there, and someone thought that was a good idea? Hope they covered what my concerns when doing that
for meat we shloud eat it cause of iron in it and proteins so w shloudnt
Algy hehehe
He said what? 6:48
The plate number 7 is covered in PLASTIC wrap💀
All I need is god❤️
who in the world takes a 25-minute shower
I met an ancient Greece man telling how to save earth
Your presentation is very amazing
Dress does not connect to your science discussion....
Is this a multi-sponsor…?
Ah yes٫ meal worms are an invention.
The idea that we may be able to completely solve the plastic crisis in just a few months by using a naturally occuring enzyme is one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard in my life
Just wondering, wouldn't plastic roads lead to a lot of micro plastic through abrasion?
In soviet earth. You don't wipe your poo, poo wipes your poo
Im not pretty sure that plastic roads is a scam, alongside lots of others. You make great videos but it seems like you just take the companies information at face value. Which is not something you can do anymore.
Mrwhosethegod?
2:10 This will help Maryland. They are just boring. When do you ever see any tourists here?
Algy
Bacon is bacon
bruh i got you ad for carma in your video
This really feels like a lecture about helping the environment and stuff
mans talked about destroying plastic and how bad it is for us just to pull out a plastic bag out at the very end
6:40 im sorry bro but i dont think my pc can handle 1m entity's
Lol number 7 "theres no real downside" Me a ceoliac: am I a joke to you?
Paper companies actually plant a huge amount of trees along with logging companies the amount of trees that these companies 0lant a day is 5 million meaning 20 million every 4 days with mr beast barely planting that amount in a year
LOVE UR CONTENT
minecraft players after seeing pavegen: *We are four parallel universes ahead of you*
Plastic roads while it sounds like a good idea would only release more microplastics into the environment. Reusing is still better than dumping but the real solution would be what the worms are doing. Total removal.
Great video. Gives me hope for the future
One of the straws I got yesterday was cool. I got boba and I'm used to the paper straws but I got a bamboo one instead. I was pleasantly surprised.
i found poo paper in the eden progect and each page is different based on the elephents diet
Are you here to roll me?
You are so cool, you dressed up like god and talks about saving the world, if we still have time to save earth when I grow up, I will found a company that uses all the things in the video
The problem is that there too expensive
Meal worms?sounds like a stray situation waiting to be happened lol
no bc if these things get used frequently we are gonna life in paradise XD
Did you rickroll us?
Imagine making a screen protector out of transparent solar that also doubles as a solar cell charger for a mobile device
I got his karma ad on this video
Dude chill.
Poo paper the best of best.
Even a sheet of poo can rickroll us!
MrBeast, introducing you to The Planting Drones.
12:19 Plastic roads seems incredibly unfeasible, for starters, plastic, especially recycled plastic, is softer than asphalt, it will break down incredibly quickly from scratches and vehicles, secondly, a road isn't just the surface, there's reinforcement and stuff underneath it, this is like plastic paving, third, when the road breaks down, it will spread microplastics into the air or carried into water by the rain.
Arun, yes planting trees is good, but before saying that they are making disappear co², making oxygen learn some science. Yes, trees take carbon dioxide, but they have limits and all carbon dioxide gets out of tree when its cut down, coz co² is stored in roots. Trees make oxygen, every plant does, but most earth oxygen(around 80%) is made by plankton living in oceans. Biggest loss if we would cut down a lot trees is loss of animals. Except for that a great video 👍👍👍. Keep up the good work
After people clickbaiting technoblades death i will not restore mine faith in humanity
just get a perm metal straw
the ecocapsule is litterally amazing. i would totally live there
I remember seeing a Shine commercial on TV and being so confused on why it was so tiny lol
Paper
Poo papa we seems like a crappy idea
Him: a worm that saves the planet  Me: really  Me later: wwoww
Nice song
But the more cows there are, the worse, because animal farts make 70% of the whole pollution! So if you eat cows it's a good thing
James 3:10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. Also Jesus is king God is king.
As a runner, Pavegen and plastic road are the best ideas I've heard
"Algggggggggggggy"
Remember Sweden ram out of waste so they took other countrys waste
Facen is Cameron Tuckers idea from modern family 😄
His dress though 😂😂😂😂
Mrwhostheboss: not tastiest plate I've ever ate  Me: YOU EAT PLATES
7:10 he  manages to rickroll us every video
i got ad that you are in start of the video
vegans: everybody should be vegan!  me who has an allergy to soy and nuts (which is the main source of protein from plants): 0-0
3:43 my family bought a pack of 100 plastic straws and we all divide them equally and wash and reuse them
My man drinks milk by itself💀
All your videos are so well put together keep it up
vegan teacher would love some of this
Jesus loves you guys!!!!
ALGE HMMMMM
Ok then, where is the bathroom in the eco capsule, and how do you get water
Whoosus Christ
In Yosemite there is a kinetic energy thing

He put tht music and tht outfit with the last on e broke me in laughter cause it seened so emotional
Mr who’s the boss, I admit, milo is really really cute. But I have my cat next to me whenever I watch your vids. And my cat has turned into milo 2.0 lol
Wind is technically solar energy, sun creates temperatures and wind.  Solar is our best energy source, it’s a free fusion reactor in the sky, we just need to harness its energy more efficiently.
I'm in the UK and I hate the paper straw I WANT THE PLASTIC STARW
So many people doing so many amazing things. This gives me hope
Making roads out of plastic to me sounds dumb & just doesn't make sense with the world giving out paper straws & other cutlery items to "help the planet" that I call BS it all comes down to money so why would they mass produce a product that they are trying to force people to stay away from dumbest thing once again comes down to money & BS
These video are really well made hea a fckn genius
mycelium good
Wait a sugar straw for my tea??? A new invention
Why did I get a ad of McDonald’s by the vegan bacon
why is no one talking about the rickroll on the poo paper 😭
He talks about saving the planet when the sponsor he is talking about uses plastic packages and he says for everyone to buy it
Arun I love you man, but the least you could've done is leave links to the products you've talked about in the description so that, even if us normies in the general public can't buy them, at least we would be able to learn more details about the said products. I mean seriously, now I have to go to google and search for any/all of these one by one.
bro my guy out here being like: This is the cure for cancer, nakes you never get sick and bullet resistant: 4/10
What's that heart option it's magical
Mealworms can help us to eat plastic but my hamster eats mealworms-
jesus looking different
i just got a advertisement with mrwhosetheboss in it and thought it was the video for a sec
This honestly made me so ecstatically happy. I can’t believe these few people are fixing our problems. For me, I would’ve put the mealworms first
this video is great because even the ads have you in them
Bro we don’t gotta make everything vegan
One thing i just realised the mealworms could be like a zurk in strategi which would be bad
10:40 - Long long time ago, people actually did not have plates. They used a bread as a plate and then ate it. :)
Ofcourse its the netherlands making a plastic bike path😂
Ill consider buying these
10:10 that ist not vegan pagke
16:13 , 16/10? Really, Arun?
9:10 it is not a bright idea
Until  the inventions are affordable by the very poor, they are inventions from hell.
Did any one ever told you you look like Anwar jebawi
he really got every sponsor ready for this vid
13:28 oh no, the little monsters in stray, omg, no,no,no,NOOOO
13:35 no I don’t in lactose intolerant
I love how the one person on number nine is a poorly pasted on picture of someone woman from google images, it’s just a random person pasted on there idk why
This is one of my favourite videos
2:42, Sia be like... IIIIIMMMMM GONNA SWIIIIIING FROM THAT
Imagine having dinner with your friends and you use the plates seen in the video but you don’t tell them that they are edible and just when all of you are about to get up from the table tell them to sit back down and pay attention to you and just slowly eat the plate
I remember when I ate hot Cheetos for the first time I was watching this channel and now I associate it with hot Cheetos lol
3:50 straws end up in animals 😏
Who needs a power bank windmill thing when I can just plug in my power bank into my power bank it actually charged
why didnt anyone ever think of the plastic road/sidewalk thing before?? it seems so obvious noww 😭
Very underrated techs
Imagine a Tesla with transparent solar. You would almost never need to charge it!
why is there not a funderaser in this vid
He always finds  a way to rick roll us 😂
with all my respect somme of these are useless i mean who would pay like 20x more money for a light  that has plants in to make oxygen the same thing goes for buildings a lot of these are impossible to add for a better society, and instead of working for  things that save little to nothing . before working/buying these items we need to complete more basic stuff like shutting down coal factories or the main plastic companies .but i support the video keep up the great videos!  and i do support those creations (companies)its just that i dont currently find a proper use.  ; ]
the clothes probably cost 100 buks
Sri Lanka made that paper
5:50 why I don’t shower 😎
or use bamboo as straws
i love how every one is complimenting on how enviroment friendly and stuff but dont get me wrong its great but,  alGee,
"Muslims can't eat bacon bc it's haram >:(" you sure about that?
I mean godly means divine, but otherwise, amazing video! Keep up the good work!
06:07 I'm on a plane, xd
if there were those electric tiles on 2 ddr machines 2 people could light up a whole city
Really had to show me them worms while I'm eating
The straw gets a 5?!
why the zstraw demo black and white?
Mrwhostheboss: al-gee Me: ITS AL-G MY GUY STOP! That one dude in the reply’s: UM HES NOT AMeReCaN My DuDe StOp BuLyInG HiM Me:you dare challenge me!
Does anyone not realise the microplastics and microfibres all the plastic products will produce. It will not solve the problem it will only delay it. (also recycled plastic takes longer to "decompose" and also sheds microplastics and microfibres).
I (for some reason) have a big fear of mushrooms and mold, so the mushroom packaging idea sounds like a good idea, but also a scary one…
I actually saw an ad with him
How exactly is burning plants harmful to the environment? Plants take co2 out of the air, and when you burn them they release co2 back into the air, no new co2 has been created or destroyed. That’s by definition carbon neutral.
That’s why I have a bath you fill it then that’s it
Thank God You Are In My FYP, I Was Watching A Guy Holding The Beg Made Of Child's Spine and something Until You Came, Thank God.
ur my favourite utuber
2:47 oh youre British eh since you said algee
i just realized, you sound a lot like nas haha
No 10/10?
Ehhh Philippines dole? Cool
Me: how much did you spend on this video Mrwhosetheboss: yes
13:02 isn't that already a thing in slither io
I love your videos
Ngl..that outfit looks heavenly legit🤩😍👁👄👁
mans from future: in the 28th of july 2022 you will make a video with mr beast
Don’t divine and godly mean the same thing
Ive had pet mealworms before never knew about the plastic thing
𝓗𝓲
Hi guys
1:16 can't you just refill the plastic bottle
HATE TO SAY IT BUT ANYTHING MADE FROM TREES IS STILL NOT ECHO-FRIENDLY   THIS IS BECAUSE THE MORE TREES U ARE REPLANTING THEY GET SICK AND BECOME VERY WEAK BUT IS A VERY LONG PROCESS BUT WHERE EVEN CLOSER TO THAT  INFACT PLASTIC IS MORE SAFE FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THEY FERTILIZE OUR SOIL AND TREES AND THE OCEAN FLOOR CORAL REEFS BIRDS THAT EAT IT ACTUALLY HELP THEM DIGEST THERE FOODS LOT BETTER IT MOST TYPES
JIM DID YOU EAT THE PLATES AGAIN?!?!??!?!?!?
i got your ad before this video lol
Yeet
oke sorry but 50 thousand euros for ha house?! bro that like buying a normal ranked house in the nether lands 35 TIMES!
Not even a godly video, can escape the Rick roll
number 7 "there's no real downside" me- whos gluten-free
i just got ur karmanow ad in ur vid lol
He literally rickrolled us using the paper… like if u noticed
At first i had to check the date to make sure this wasn't an april fools video
hey man, you said you wouldn't drink bubble tea;
This man needs something for all his rickrolls.
i dont vibe with the one grill, i cant just get to the food im cooking easy. a lot of times i dont have a recipe exact, so im just gonna keep it open as much as i do a regular grill, but i cant get to the food as fast.
Can we just appreciate this man's dedication to rickrolling us?
you could also convert mealworms into food
What year are you in the 21 century 2100 whaaaaaat
Arun: "21 Inventions that will Save the World."   Also Arun: "Vegon Bacon!!!"
I mean huel is litterally chipotle but in liquid
i watched an ad you made about karma and i thought it was the real video
The bioproduced enzymes for breaking down 'plastics' can, so far, only break down one or two actual types of polymer.
As someone who lives on tank stored, collected rainwater in a low-rainfall area, the idea of  'a relaxing 25 minute shower' is just inconceivable
why u start the vid with  a sponsor for karma ):
Loving this channel from couple of years ago
that vegan teacher would be so happy
We need the Sidemen reacting on these, SIDEMEN!
Nice fit!
I KNEW SOMETHING HAD TO BE OUT THERE THAT BREAKS DOWN PLASTIC!!
I take 10 minute showers how in this world takes 25 minute showers
What are you wearing?
Karens when they find out they can't buy a fur coat made of water bottles
waight are parents not effecient?
Son : Mom , I've Finished Eating . *Mom : No Honey You Have To Finish Eating Your Plate Before You Can Go.*
:O I GOT A MR WHOSE THE BOSS ADD ON THIS VID
I like his channel and all but the fact he called a bubble tea a soft drink is really sacreligious
There are already metal straws that are reusable
We need all of these as normal things because then: spoilers for Dr.strange⬇️         It would be more like earth 838.🫠
Btw is facon haram
i have a rubber straw
7:33 LOL paper
Lets make sure that we execute all these to the fullest!
i dont think eating meat is bad in any way, its just due to the major factories which try to pump as much meat out as it can. instead of trying to make vegan foods taste like meat, we should try to have more localized purchases from farms, and stray from using major factories   i dont know why i posted this, tl;dr more farms and ranches less meat factories
you pronounced joanna wrong
7:15 rick roll??
God
1:42 *cheese*
am i the only one who realised he rick rolled everybody?
Does anyone know what the brand of the jacket is at 0:34
Anybody can help count how many pints are used in this episode you’re a pretty godly
that's not a bright idea
we dont need straws, just build it into the cup or dont use it
13:36 I don't😞
14:38 so it would take it 1,000 days to turn into Mr. Beast
0:52 LMAO his cloud storage
Arun is shocked how many products are good and bad but at the end is shocked
Well...if i want to use a straw,i just use my steel ones :D
Dad jokes are so bad why!!!!
Finally with that poo paper we can clean shit with a shit  hahaha
To brish
Hello
Huel is the 22
21
tree plants: cost 40 dollars tree the old way: He is wrong
Inventions like these makes me wonder why we are still dealing with climate change
I like the plastic roads better then the meal worms.  Plastic eating enzymes tend to break it down into pretty toxic stuff.
No offense but I don't think metalwork were invented they just existed
I wonder if you were to throw meal worms in your composter pile could you then compost plastic? Or would the poo have chemicals in it and not be useful?
I know this might sound negative but believe me after seeing humanity i just don't believe in us. I never wanted to see human race cause i thought we will extinct ourselves in a few decades because of our selfishness and greed. For the 1st time in my life, i want to see the future us. And that's because of this video. Some of the world saving invention really gives me joy and hope that we might be saved. I always hated our kind because how stupid and ignorant we are. Wasting food, creating millions of plastic waste, polluting air, so i never seemed to like human kind. These type of video create an effect within me that there might be hope after all. Thank you @Mrwhosetheboss for making this video.
if u go to starbuks u get edible straws lol
Did i just get rickrolled by poo paper
“To goodly” Says that while wearing a Jesus suit lol
btw these people charge you more money to save the world so like tht power bank i saw was 249 dollars like wtf?
16:20 -said an angry porn director
Is there even something that gets a 10/10 rating?
*_Lights something on fire_**** "I- don't know why I just did that- this is all flammable.. 😳"
Fun fact about BioTrem! You can use it for Biodegradable pots for planting!
Media and internet : I am so sorry but scientist says we are fucked Scientists :.. That's.. True.. Inventors : hold my tea
Your name is sooo funny like mrwhosethebose
i did some comparing myself and the camera on the 5k imac was actually better than the imac pro so i dont know what happened there . . .
13:40 really taking shots at the lactose intolerant, huh?🥲
bruh number seven came in plastik lol 10:00
is it pronounced al-jee or al-gee in the uk?
0:20 Or an silicon strove I have one
"I'm feeling wet just thinking about it"
Poo paper notebooks: might exist Teachers licking their finger when they flip through pages: oh no
send plastic into space!!!!!!!!!!!!
this is just fab
By the way, I live close to where Dole shot the Pinapple Harvesting Scene, literally the same municipality.  And the mountain in the background is called Mt. Matutum...and it's actually not a mountain, it's a volcano.
Plastic roads would spread micro plastic in whole ecosystem!
the problem with a lot of this technology is that the companies who create it generally treat it as a premium product and therefore make the price more expensive.  because of this, the average consumer will generally select the already-existing variant over the new, perhaps more ecologically-friendly variant, simply based on the cost.
“You can even eat it, what is there wrong with this?” Me:it wouldn’t be but there is a small problem,I along with others can’t eat wheat
I knew he was going to show u some heavenly inventions, but did not know he was going to dress up like someone from my sunday school text book
From the time i knew about mrwhosetheboss, it has always been my one youtube Channel and i enjoy watching till the end. Thanks for been my best channel ever.
Team seas
for straws, some resturants have pasta straws
Nothing was a 10/10 E
Wind tree system= buttplug tree
Cloud Storage 😂😂😂
When he was talking about the drones, I thought he was going to say, ‘Parents that actually come back’
Out of anything I could see in a Mrwhosetheboss video, I did not expect Chandelure.
these types of inventions should be all around the world. its fucking genius
I’m in loflil I’m chilling
Building that is alive?  ….  Don’t be racist I am a building　☻
Kim Kardashian’s bout to run away from mealworms
Joanna Breitenhuber is pronounced yo-anna b(non-rolled)r -ai-tenh-oo-ber
Yea uhh I don’t have lactaid enzymes cuz am lactose intolerant so I cant really digest regular milk
There are also stainless steel straws that are reusable but not very portable
Thank you for talking about plastic Road we had a geography presentation that we had to make and I didn’t know what to do it on and I ended up choosing plastic Road and if I didn’t hear about it from you I probably would’ve had anything prepared! (You have to talk about inventions that can save the world and I was gonna pick one of the other ones but most of these were similar to what my classmates chose so I didn’t wanna do anything too similar so I picked one of those completely different) (this was months ago when we did it tho)
also am i the only onw who notices that he is wearing that activity tracker ring( correct me if im wrong)
9:22 how the- that is 100 times cheaper thatn houses where i live (seriously!!)
Wait wait wait do ppl in america do it on fire? In europe(at least in my place) we light a fire and then we let the fire extingwish tus the coal is hot and heating the food without fire
That biotrem plate truley is awesome, but what about people who are gluten free
i wish all people knew how important saving the envoirment is keep up the good work 👍👍👌
Don't you know that they replace those trees
Ur people killed our people     I really don't like that
Number 21 I give it a 10/10
16:19 wow be careful
The fact that he rates a power bank more than an alive building
but Huel is not recycable ?    Is huel recycable?
in year 2 my school made us make paper out of newspaper and it was pink, like, whats the point?😂
yall ssee the liar txt when he said its not mine
Bro literaly said best plate I've ever had
I request you to turn to vegan or at least vegetarian too. Please.
Man’s like “we can solve all plastic problems in a few months…9/10.” Lol love this guy
why do you even need straw at the first place, you can drink it without any kind of straw you know. 😂
I saw the “that’s what she said” there 😉
I’m cringing how he pronounces algae, also i bet you won’t pin me
ah yes, my favorite invention, *_mealworms_*
None of these things will ever be adopted en mass...
double catch went smoothly
I wanna know if you can eat that mushroom packaging
Sass’s
7:11 look at the paper
8:43 what’s the music that was used? It’s lit
Not to be rude, but most of this products are genuinely shit, like actual worthless crap, grossly inefficient to the point where using the less "tech savy" option is actually better for the environment, like the plastic roads, it triggers me quite a while, because this shit gives the impression of helping while doing jackshit
Omgg wow I never knew that I lived in England 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
POV 6:10 me in ikea: hexadeca it
The plastic roads are a scam. Plastic is a lot harder to recycle then asphalt, and it's not as durable as plastic. Really, there are many other things you can do with plastic where it would be great. I'm all for the inventions that improve environment, but I hate things like this that is only made for activists that know nothing about it, and just have "plastic = bad" mindset.
now more people will be able to survive off of C                          O                                   R                                 N
Am i  the only one or is Arun dressing like A god
4:08 "thats what-" LMFAOOOO
Im pretty sure that the tech behind pavegen was invented by a school boy coz it was hella brilliant idea that he got coverage by the news
Ok dokie. I want dat bottle
University of New South Wales announced last week they've developed panels that convert infrared emissions to electricity. That means they can operate at night! Obviously not as well as daytime, but that's a big breakthrough
4:03 That's what she said
A company that recycled over 30 billion plastic bottles is worse than a soap bottle invention…
Are you Muslim?
How crazy do you want to dress? Mr boss,  “yes”
*habby-tat*
hey boss the intro was godly
Nothing well save the planet
the vegan bacon is not good only for vegans but people that keep kosher
sir we have a new item for sale, its eco friendly- BRING ME THAT ON YOUR BEST PLATES. s-s-s-sir, it IS the plate.
In the barbecue did he leak his partner?
I left a paper straw in a drink multiple times and it didn’t go floppy any of those times, so I don’t know what you are talking about.
8:22 Mate Goes Into  The Dictionary To Find A New Word For Amazing To Fit The Theme
I accidentally touched your video and watched it. Since then I have been watching your videos. Today iam proud because that poo sheet company is is our country company (Sri Lanka) 😉
“The same way you probably have lactase enzimes to be able to break down milk!”   lactose intolerant people: *and I took that personally*
This video made my day
Tastiest plate.that you have ever had !!!
what
Angelic huh
1:40 really???🤨🤨
Mmmm
bro some time in the future some people on a diet would be eating wheat bran plates instead of ricecakes or whatever there called
He missed the chance to say a sub to the channel would be inkredible
Vegan bacon. All the muslim be like HALAL
6:06 i dont have a room
Tastiest plate I ever ate 😂😂😂
Those people are saving the world from potential doom. Respect to them *cheering* 👏👏👏
You Should Tell The First One To Mr.Beast Like if You Agree
Leather from cows is a byproduct of the meat industry; no cow is killed for their leather.
4:09 THats what is written in the screen
The vegan teacher would use the products of the VeGaN leather.
I am happy that the FBI sees this
Why is his theme playing in the background of heavenly
Plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz
Plz give me iphone in pakistan
You're disrespectful as I am lactose intolerant
fungus plastic and meal worm idea are really interesting .
the meal worm idea is interesting.
I think we should build gaint nuclear energy plants on the moon. and then transport that energy via microwaves to earth. problem solved
humanities last hope: "meal worms" XD
the shower head is cool...
coud you eat that mushroom box?
7:13 rickroll!
These are really amazing inventions. The only downer with plastic roads seems to be that the friction of people using those roads causes the plastic to break down into micro plastic and pollute the surrounding environment. I also wonder with the air ink - it's removing pollution from the air, but is it neutralising it or just returning it to the environment in a different form? But some real game-changers in here for sure.
also about invirnonment friendly stuff just return blimps and zeppelins they are less poluting then planes and they are litteraly a flying hotel
I'm not so sure about the plastic roads, surely it would break down into micro plastics which then get washed away by rain and pollutes water etc etc
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
I like how he dress like jesus
Is it just me or everybody saw that when he was playing the clip of drinking milk he was gonna vomit
Why is he dressed like he's from ancient Rome?  Complete with a wreath of guilded laurel leaves!?
Ill do anything but touch a vegan food.
gooooooooood
7:11 That is the shittiest idea ever
How did this guy become so adorable?
4:00 just use a hallo spaghettti pasta thingy. right?
Him- Now we have, Mealwor- Me- I'm nto eating that xD didn't even have to bring up the main topic I just knew aha
4:07 anyone else notice that small text to the right of the dudes head (our prospective)
Solar panels: Photovoltaics are among the worst ways to harness solar energy. They are massively inefficient, they have a high production cost, the process of producing them is incredibly toxic, they are extremely fragile and rarely last more than ten years before their components degrade, they cannot be recycled when they need to be replaced, and the typical lifetime power generation is comparable to the power consumed by the acts of mining, constructing, transporting, and installing the things.  0/10: Worse pollution than coal. Do better research.
Plastic road: Question. Are they flammable?
Vegan fake meat: You really don't want to look at the nutritional labels and health effects of the chemicals that go into those things.  Anyone remember when margarine was replacing butter everywhere? Heavily processed vegetable oil, all the flavor of lightly processed milk without the health issues. Then it turned out that the oils used were among the worst for human health, and animal fats (like butter) are among the healthiest.  0/10: This food will kill you.
Pinya means pineapple in filipino
"Cloud storage" lmaoooo
Mushroom packaging: Plastic has serious disposal issues but it's usually inert. That stuff is alive. I have a lot of questions I'd want answered to make sure it wasn't going to take over the lawn, poison my pets, or rot and lose cohesion if my package is delayed.
algee
Solar and wind are the biggest scams of modern times. Extremely unreliable and require a separate but related industry for storing and providing power during the night. And until we find a better way to store electricity lithium batteries, which are highly toxic, are the only option. Why are so many people ignoring nuclear power?
yeah but barbies are fun cause you see it getting cooked
scrolling down
Me jumping on the floor to produce energy: I am four parallel universes ahead of you
imagine licking an envelope and finding out its poo paper 💀
I will say that I am against vegan food and products for a few reasons. One being that I live on my families farm. If the world switches to vegan products, it could shut down our farm, and many others. Also, God said in the Bible that he gave us animals for us to use them. So why are we trying to replace them? I do get that some animals are being mass hunted. But we have animals for a reason.
1st to dogs be like:hey why can’t I see juquinola through this glass
Wait Dole? Its in the philippines so vegan leather is from the philippines YEEEAAAAAHHHHH
I have an idea *_SPAGHETTI STRAWS_*  •they decompose (I think) •take way longer to sog compared to paper straws •Cheap to produce •you can technically eat them after using  •*Probably Tons of more benefits that I dont know about*
1:18 imagine if that falls in the water while taking a bath and you don't notice.
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
This guy will ALWAYS find the dumbest and funniest ways of rickrolling us...I mean he rickrolled us through poo paper!
Bro said ‘Divine’ 😭
In London the water tank would fill up in 60 seconds🤣🤣🤣
04:09 SHE SAID
The wind tree system wait till a hercane or really windy day
4:49 Richie rich moment
i am very happy to see that the world is starting to become self sufficient
I'm still not goin vegan
13:36 oh..  i don't have them :( well that's sad i guess
if u think abt it Humans cant stop eating meat other wise the whole world would be polluted with animals just everywhere
BioTrem plates were wrapped in plastic sheet🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jeesus
do they sell refills for the pollution ink pen?  Other wise you remove some pollution from that air, but have pollution in the plastic pen case.
9:42 very good thing for a place like bir tawil which im gonna take welp ready to make my government building so funny
7:26  future me : i remember when paper was made of wood and elephants made much less poo future : elephant : tons of poo elephant too : domesticated
im only on the first invention and my positivity has been raised by atleast 80 %. Thanks
I have been to a place where they make the poo paper in real life and it was kinda strange.
If that Poo-paper becomes mainstream then I can see people building elephant stables/or whatever and force feeding them to make these PooPers
HES EATING A PLATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1              never gonna give you up never let you down
he loves rick rolling us
Poo paper is really shi**y
Nothing will restore my faith in humanity lol
bruh even thought i knew it was a video i was still waiting to skip the ad when i started the video
Penius
4:41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Malaysia peoples: WHYYYYYYY
Love the concepts and it's awesome to see the progress, but mealworm enzymes aren't going to "solve the world's plastic problem in a few months" lol, gotta love the optimism though.
Paper straws suck!!!
Damn.vegans must hate plants.
7:04 bruh how is it solving both problems like it's just elephant poop how is it gonna stop them from being hunted?
7 takes eat your plate to another level
Number 7 wouldn't work for anyone is celiac or gluten-free
8:59 what if ur app gets hacked
I’ll wear vegan leather, but absolutely not going vegan except unless I have to
As you can see in my profile pic its a gecko and he loves worms mealworms
"that's the greatest plate I ever ate" No, I once ate a paper plate that I spilt chocolate milk on
What a well put together video. Thank you! That tunic though!
"If you go anywhere now and order a soft drink, you will get a paper straw"  Enter: most of the United States not giving a crap about the planet 🥴
i mean, i was thinking about solutions like this, but i didn`t know they are being applied, they are just forming life forms that now are worthless but overtime they become as significant as today`s life became from that one random cell formed bilions years ago by random.
Dude in my country whit 50.000€ you buy one amazing apartment!!! Not a trailer!!!!!
I love when the  editor puts his female version on the videos hahhaa
at 6:31 in your video you're talking about a showerhead that atomizes the water to provide water savings. The US Navy has been using a water saver showerhead for years that does the same thing. I have one in my bathroom that provides a fantastic shower and only cost around $30
GIVE!!
i just realize that at the end my sponsor blocker couldn't see that it was sponsor and just let it play like normal your sponsoring was so detailed it tricked the blocker thinking it was descriptive text XD
6:47 "i am feeling wet by thinking about it" 😂😂 double meaning 😂
i shower like 2 mins onlyy
I was outside spraying aerosol cans into the atmosphere throughout the entirety of this video.
am i the only one who needs that roman shirt ASAP?
"best plate ive ever had" you ate other plates??
Products that reuse plastic that would otherwise pollute the earth: 2/10  Fake bacon: 7/10
God is good and real
Damn....... No.1 is like LIFE-CHANGING
We obviously have to abandon meat... Save yourself, the planet and animals, switch to a vegan lifestyle
i wonder if the plastic roads water system can generate energy using water
Handsome, intelligent, sophisticated, funny, entertaining and useful videos by Mrwhosetheboss. Keep up the spectacular work! I love your videos.
❤
but is the huel drink good for kids over 10 years
That Poo Paper is such a brilliant idea!!! I love that shit! Pun intended 😜
Well it better restore my faith in humanity or I'll give a dislike (not that it matters anyway due to how many likes)
this is a good example of why you are the best and biggest tech YouTuber in the world
if tech companies weren't a bit too greedy, the world would have been a better place..
For number 14 But im a muslim
On number 13 is a 1/10. Cows fart green house gas . Many tons of it every day. Which makes climate change worse.
Sir i see your video,, you destroyed many i phone…🥹🥹 Please give me one i phone 🙏🙏🙏🙏🥹😢 It’s my dream but i am so poor boy😢😢😭😭😭
"Godly" "divine" same thing
Lol the idea that it is someone’s job to stuff mushrooms into a mould is hilarious to me and I don’t know why.
Sub to yuo
So many great inventions, makes me wonder how many other inventions were out there that didn’t come to light, like the water fueled car 🚗
1:41 look in the box
Pavegen is literally a idea that i had and didnt think of how to develop them
10:43 Image Your at The Dinner Table And Your Little Brother Starts Eating His Plate
Cutting paper for trees is good because it keeps alive the only major companies preserving wood (paper companies)
are muslims allowed to eat facon?
why does the poo paper have a rick pic
13:35 : me when i realised that wasnt milk
Even if many people are helping the earth by planting trees picking up trash its not enough We need everyone to help every human on earth to work together remember, Teamwork Makes The Dream Work
Honestly we need to promote more of these technology that can probably save the world
Wearing clothes made of plastic will just introduce microplastics into the environment as the clothing degrades
where is your future lamp ? it was kinda cool though
Hi god😆
Also the reason why allot of people don't want to be vegan is because meat is superior.
Nah dont change the way people bbg its about the flavor of the wood that burns into the meat.
Elephant poo paper makes sense but thats not the reason elephants are killed in the first place i would say the easiest way to stop elephant poaching is to just shoot the f#@kers that think it has male enhancement properties.
Throw away plastic tableware? My asian heart can't
Did anyone else see the thats what in the top corner during the zstraw part
and if the plastic clothes burn? then u have a problem.
My dad literally just bought that Nebia showerhead!😁😀
13:35 CU-
9:00 my food finally warm? 🥺
7:11 OH SHIT RICK ASTLEY
Awesome video but you should really learn how to say algae
I​ love bacon!
Plate one is good but its wirde eating your plate on public
You Hindu?
This is a good idea, I already have a couple of pants 👖👖 made of plastic bottles they are nice.👍👍👍🤗🤗🤗
Number 7 takes the saying “finish your plate” to a whole nother level
Inventions from poor countries
Tensions from poor countries
May god bless the people who created these inventions.
bruh only $50,00 dollears i cant buy  that and that not cheap😂
Costumes impresses me alot
omg his jokes are so bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤣
He never runs out of words 🙃😅
(4:26) What an unoriginal name! This is the nickname I personally use for the quorn bacon I have at home.
@7:10 you just got rickrolled
Can you eat the mushroom package
Goats already had enzymes to break down plastic; but it'd be more efficient to re-use the plastic than to digest it.
The whole "Plastic Road' Idea is great; but much more sustainable in a planet that's tropical year round so there isn't repeated expanse and contraction albeit they could integrate a system to create electricity off it; albeit the planet already does so naturally humans already have to harness it.
The ecocapsule would easily be 10/10 if it was designed with a habitat system built in for the growth of plants and animals which would be very easy to do.
2:32 Favorite part  Heavenly rate: 4 out of 10 or 5/2
Love how you were dressed like a Romain
America is not about to be more in debt just to save the world .
Love this video I wanna get all of this
I am from Germany and well You spelled it wrong, the name but my english isn't that good either and I lover your Videos so i dont care about such a small mistake 🤜🏽🤛🏽❤️
Yasss
i still love this theme so im rewatching (the content too of course)
he: I CANT THINK HOW COOL IS THIS rating: 05/10
Thank you for this! I was watching this is awe of what could be for a better world
they should make a self powered dance dance revolution pad with #5
10:12  Did you know that 50 percent of people in Iceland can’t eat wheat or have it touch their food
"Its like we have the enzymes to break down and digest milk" Latose intolerant people: :/
He said euro that means you live in Ireland I’m from Ireland but please don’t hate cause I’m Irish.
I love you, your like the new bob ross
Lol
no i disagree just get a power bank with a solar panel
When I heard air ink I was expecting a 3d pen that while drawing could hold things up in the air, so I got disappointed when I found out the real item
4:09 ''That's what'' she said ;)
How many litres is 2.5 galons
I've heard of vacon but not veather....
To anyone reading this Jesus Christ loves you have a blessed day❤️🙏✝️
In Pakistan usually every house has solar panels on its roof
I'm trying to build up my immunity as much as i can without going overboard/doing extreme things so the anti bactirea straws are amazing, also my water kinda has bactirea so prob gonna need a fix [also i take about more than 10 minutes to take a bath since im sensitive]
Love that Roman toga
That huel packaging bag is also of plastic 😅
algee?
When I take 45 minute showers: …
Ha, the first one might have jimmy or mrbeast Starter of Team Seas, and Trees may be helping out with the plastic!
*literal game changing invention that could possibly be one of the large stepping stones to save the earth from global warming, while also being affordable* Mrwhosetheboss: Nice invention, 6/10
This brings a hole new meaning to finish ur plate
Y didn’t me beast make Jackets
50 bucks for a plastic bag replacement that dissolves into water and edible plates? There's no altruism in business, just making money on people paying to save a planet that will save itself when the next supervolcano erupts when necessity creates REAL planet saving technology. Consume different, not less, is the scheme. Also solar panels last just a few years and are in landfills everywhere!
I want that fabric.
9:09 That's not a bright idea                    Kidding😅
At 4:10 it says that what she said
Mrwhosetheboss is basically the tech GOD
Imaging your mom says dont forget to eat your dishes
vegan beef and vegan leather makes cows redundant, farmers would barely make money off them and while it would save the animal noone would even buy cows in the first place because theres no money to be made..
That soap one is so freaking cool
i feel like poo paper would make people want to farm and fence elephants even more to get the paper...
Best video i have seen till date in 2022. Hat's  off to you arun for such videos.
i like how facon placed higher than a biohybrid building.
2:15 I saw those completely wrong
Me seeing the second one :GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST SCIENCE IN THE WORLD!
NFT's are FaKe💵💵💵💵💵💵💵MeTa verse  is not good for human ...it is the dumbest thing  i have ever witnessed💰💰💰
Pretty ink readable...
Dragon Ball predicted the Ecocapsule
I LOVED the presentation of the last invention that was soooo beautiful
Fr tho
"It's really smokey, greasy and meaty"
And that vegan leather will be good if your starving 🥸 just take a shoe off and cut it up and put it in some ramen noodles 😆
10:55 the humor ahhaha
Poo paper is a Rick roll
Love this vid A. One of my fav coz It can been seen so clearly ❤️🤜💥🤛❤️
Algae pronounced alJea
You want to know what I think about being vegan for the animals then hit read more           The company still is gonna sell meat products and your wasting more meat also no hate
im certain in yona brighten hoober
Yo dawg, I herd you like soap, so I put soap in your soap so you can soap yourself while you shoap yourself. You've got a pimped up soap, man.
“I am a building don’t be racist”
This is indeed my most favourite ❤️ hopeful for a great future
Noice
am sorry but im never ever ganne turn vegan
*HOLY JESUS*
make more of these, but stop giving everything a 6/10
Number 18 needs to be in Wyoming
Whos gonna pay 600$ for a shower head lol?????
i unsubbed bc he said going vegan is healthier but its not you need meat\
huel started at germany  respect us germans mofo
At the twentieth place, bottles were thrown at him, and he caught them, and I want to know one thing. Why was that actually kinda cold? That was so smooth!  Edit: HOW IS HE SO SMOOTH WHEN HE CATCHES EVERYTHING!?!?
All of this are great but if I had to guess how many of this have monetary insentive
I save so much water i have saved £19 of water
If you are interested in this stuff you NEED TO LOOK UP MELALUCA
Ford was using mushroom moulds to form car seat and panels  then coating them, a while ago. Idk if they still do?? Neat concept,  mushrooms recycle organic matter waist. So people utilized natural process to make materials for people.
Us: Look what we invented God: Get your own elements buddy
It does not look like real bacon, so FAIL
you realize that divine literally means godly?
Those trees look like Lego trees
7:20 sry but no one eho actually uses paper for reasons like...dokuments or art will use that. It just looks awfull
I’ve used the Nebia shower head, it is best for the oily skin type, I’ve tested it, my skin is the sensitive skin type and it hurts like hell when the droplets hit you at full speed. Still I would recommend it to people who isn’t bothered by the feeling
OMG 7:34 sus
15 il give it 100000/10
I have a flashlight that can recharge itself, without batteries.
4:08 Xd you can clearly see "That's what"
did anyone notice the text at 4:09 ? it says "that's what" in translucent text
I speedrun showering
Its sad that oil companies will look to supress this kind of info.
The plates were still covered with plastic yhough
Love the outfit brother.
Best Video I ever seen yet  so good that I finally subscribed to the channel
Nobody gonna talk about the plastic cover on the plate
So many awesome vegan options! Love this video!!
AYYYYOOOOOOO 4:67
poo paper is ancient paper
oh gosh the small jokes never gets old, inkcreadible
His outfit was cool 🥲
Hey Boss, can you do videos on hacking and how common people like me can be safe...?! I feel you are the one whom we can trust on this..!!
My man's got the drip👌
Poo paper RICK ROLL
Dang so much pun intended here xd
we feels heavenly after these (3 people are watching)
transparent solar is a cool idea too bad it wont become a thing for a long time because other power industries like coal and gas will funnel money into politicians pockets to prevent them from making it a thing
How are we going to save the planet and be eco friendly if the average everyday person can’t afford these eco friendly products because they cost to much? Things like this need to be affordable enough for Everyone
Cách hát của Phúc hiện đại, tinh tế và mang hơi hướng Kpop nhưng lại rất ấm áp, dịu dàng...1 ca khúc tuyệt vời ❤
Do not eat plates
Watched a reel of him with smooth legs an hour ago. And now I'm convinced he's removing his hair and I'm absolutely not complaining about it...
DIO should have used this
21 should be at 1 bad boy
"Algee" 💀 ☠️
for the straws just use hard thick plastic straws thats what i use and its reusable i've been doing it for years and havent gotten a new one
i have tried one of the fancy shower heads they just spray cold air at you with barely any water
*This is a great video,I learn alots watching your videos and it’s helpful to me*  *investing money is quite difficult to me but all thanks to Mia Frank she helped me alots*
6:46 “ i’m feeling wet just thinking about it” normal to say for a man, weird to say for a woman
Plastic roads are a stupid idea, they'd create nano plastics and plastic dust that could be breathed in. Nano Plastics leaching into the environment is a big issue and plastic roads would make it so much worse.
*SHEEEEEESH*
if the world switches to poo paper, I'm never reading or writing again.
Did I really just get Rick rolled with paper… good Job! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Me: *watching the first item while drinking out of a plastic water bottle* 0-0
can’t wait to eat some plates in the future!
Plz do me a favor and never wear that ever again
Naive, liberal BS
Plastic roads would be shooting up plastic particle though because cars will be driving on it which will be scraping it and causing it to get a lot of it ripped up you can't really see with your eyes but it is there
The capsules looks like one of the houses in dbz
Asphalt is already the most recycled material in history
I got a HUGE bug that makes his face cover half of the screen the whole video
When are vegans gona realize the animals get used for those things after they had a good life and the farmers put them down so they don't suffer wating to die? The farmers are doing what is right for the animal so they don't have to suffer and rott
Not going to lie, I lost so much faith in humanity when I learnt that when we began space travel, a lot of junk was in space. This god-tier genius is what gives me hope.
I want that 🚿 🤣
What if we turn Co2 in electricity if thats possible
خیلی خوب
A race to finish before it gets floppy,  Mrwhosetheboss: "Thats what-" Me: "SHE SAID!!!"
By far the best invention video
I cany bealive that a foldable straw got higer up the list than a living building
10:11 nice invention but it is invented to reduce plastic but it is wrapped with plastic?
Arun is mega sus. "I'm getting wet just thinking about it" 🤣
14:02 when he said hebeeetat tho lol😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
New invention Vid plz
8. no toilet though
why did no. 10 feel like an actual good passionfruit ad?🤣
Your tech ideas are great but the biggest problem is there are too many people on this planet thus destroying it. To save the world the human population has to be controlled. Any solutions to that problem?
Waiting for thunderfoot to debunk half of these
"don't fly": lol It's a long drive from Alberta to Florida
I use bamboo plates btw                                                                                                                   lol                                                 epic lol                                               lol U wasted ur time.Why?
4:09 LMAOOOOOOOO
.
We've solved every problem- ...
Ww need this
hey, number 13 gives us more food to eat
youre promoting vaporware
Why are you so picky with the rating
Why are you so picky
13:38 that is funny that you say that, because i am lactose intolerant.
so he literally gave a vegan leather higher score than a plastic-botlle-clothing-thingy
The giveaway not free
Omg I love u so much Arun like I can’t emphasise how well u put all that info into 17 mins if u weren’t a YouTuber the world would’ve lost a talent
Too bad I am allergic to wheat or the plate would be good
💙
The poo paper has a problem tho, you have to feed the elefant with fiber. So it would be needed to do grand plantations to feed the elefant that are on the "elefant corral". BUT this is just one minor problem, because we can just reuse the tree paper plantation area to do so. This basically  just solves the elefant hunt and probally decrease the massive plantation.
Elephents eat trees
Vegan protin sources like aloument milk cost more and create 10 thimes the emictions
25 minutes in the shower?....wth are you doing for that long.
Just use tabo and balde to shower
1:01 imagine how many times did he repeat that scene
I am obsessed with bacon I am goIng to buy vegan “bacon” and see
1:02 one of the smoothest Catches Ever Caught
Imagine poo paper as toilet paper
He is becoming cool day by day
Why the fuck is nobody talking about the rickroll at 7:09
Wierd question though  How many plates have u eaten ? 🤣🤣🤣 I see my self 10 years from now still watching ur videos
Number seven isn’t good for everyone some people are gluten-free no hate I love your videos
Whats up with the bots in your comments? Sketchy.
I recycled monthly 120 ton plastic bro
Wow
Number 12 at the end I’m feeling wet now lol
I wish I could see the next generations and see if they took better care of the earth then the past generations
imagine raging in a biohybrid building and crack the wall
the transparent panel is really godly, some concerns about: price to produce, maintenance, recycle
The bad ting wite fakon is i kant buy it
I love this theme bruh, hearing about people trying to save the planet in extremely interesting ways puts a huge smile on my face.
Did anybody else realize on the poop paper there was Rick Ainsley doing the Never Going To Give You Up song
the edible plates r my favorite
Your feeling what ? 😂
A Lot of these technologies are great , but not scalable at an "affordable" price
I like the vid but I think your ratings are weird for this one, a living building if way cooler then a reusable straw
Hey did you know that they use elephant poop to make notebooks as well just like poo paper
1:52 until someone eats it
The best way for saving this planet is when all humans become gay/lesbian. Most problems of this planet will be solved within 50 years. 😁
Good video but the backround music is too hight.
The plate idea is good but what if you’re eating off the table you don’t want to eat a plate that’s been sitting on the table
Do you get to keep all those techs?  Like I really jealous you 😂😂😂…. In a good way tho I just need one smart phone and that night vision lenses (I can’t see at night) 😂
I thought there were already turtles that could eat plastic?
50 thousand euros is enough to buy a good house and a great view plus extra change to buy a car and a good furnitures in my village hehe. 50 thousands euros can completely change my life from zero to hero but alas its a dream which kicks your ass just for dreaming it lol
Once I start...I cant stop watching your videos❤️❤️❤️ u are way too addictive than any other videos I have watched cause of ur voice, expression, movement, comedy, acting and many more which is very VERY interesting and mesmerizing...love you bro... a simple poor guy from NAGALAND 😁May GOD BLESS YOU ABUNDANTLY
For the water situation, someone needs to build a shower and tub that have a built in water heating and filtration system so when you take a shower you run a bit of water and the system then takes over and recycles that water multiple times instead of just running fresh water down the drain... I figure we have all the technology it just has to be built and refined into a functional system.
Thirty years ago I had the idea of generating electricity by a car's engine sound by using pizas. No, not pizza!
My schools uniform is made out of plastic
4:07 that’s what she said
HOLY COW  🕳E 🐮
When i stumbled upon this i was like YESSSSSSSSSS
I’m sure if Jesus gave you a contraption that turned water into wine you’d give it a 1/10.
What in the world are you wearing??? And, GREAT CONTENT DUDE!!!🙂
His house looks like it was decorated in the 70's :-)
now that i observe the background lights are different and are featured in the 10 million giveaway
1:40 what was in the box
South Korea still uses plastic straws.
In my opinion number 21 should be switched with number 15 because its way better for the earth. Great video arun 😊
Recycling plastic to clothes: I have a grounding in environmental science so I hope that my opinion here carries some weight. This is green-washing (making a product seem more environmental friendly than it is)  as these reworked plastics are a key cause of laundry based micro plastic release into water ways. I don’t argue this is an innovative solution, I just want to bring light to the depth of the situation. Plastics degrade very slowly and due to this the consequences of using this material is one which has Longevity.
my dad makes nft's in the toilet , noflushable turds
I've had plastic plates that says its "sTrOnG" when I rip it like paper it breaks 💔 😢
i don't get why vegan people try to replicate non-vegan foods. No offense if you want to be vegan good on you. But than don't rip of bacon and steak and other non-vegan food. Make up your own food. Good vid tho :D
Team seas
thank you , Jesus
Can you eat only hule and be okay?
Anyone got a link for that facon? Got some vegan friends who are looking for it
We got rick rolled in the paper
Funfact he is wearing a plastic crown
Greaat content Arun! Keep it up
Amazing ❤️
STOP RICKROLLING ME
You actually pronounced the Name Joanna Breitenhuber quite well.
I love this man so much 😂❤️
Amaze-sun
Who spends 25 minutes in the shower?
Becoming vegan will never happen again. Tried it once and it was literally the worse experience and the worse thing for my health and wallet. Having a balance diet has made me healthier and happier.
but huel comes in a plastic bagagge
Congratulations 🎉 in advance brother 10m🖤🔆
Are you in the UK 🇬🇧 or USA 🇺🇸? I am from the UK 🇬🇧
I love this mans Content bro i could watch it all day n night
i can just imagine saying to my future child "remember to eat your plate"
A lot of these are super cool! now I can look for a winter jacket mad of recycled plastic!
Burh this is cool af
I knew the leather alternative from pineapples were familiar, they were similar to how some clothing in the Philippines are made with fibers of different crops especially pineapples
I'not vegan actually, Im reasonable Troller
I thought You got mobey. What about foldable straw? Can eat my vegan shi*. Btw, GL and BLNT (good luck and better luck next time)
watching this after your video on worrying about humanity
The problem Huel is rather you have to spend 80 bucks or so to get the free stuff
I never thaught i will be hearing the tastiest plaate
Man those catches at 0:58 were awesome.
2:19 Thats not efficient. There are much better ways to gather Energy from Wind than that. I recommend you to check if such "Inventions" make sense so Kickstarter money goes where its needed
Love it
Algee!! NOT alguwee...
The puns............
Are you a Muslim ??????????
I thought of making the type of worms who can eat plastic but now i know that it has already been invented 😑😑😑😑looks like i have to think about something else🤔🤔maybe the cure for cancer💜
Need the cattle to eat the grass…what else will, they were made for it, plus sheep. Manure fertilises. Goats browse the weeds and rough stuff. Poultry eat the insects and lay masses of eggs.
4:08 i appreciate the joke from the editor
hope they make ads remover
I don’t really like tech Chanel’s but mrwhosetheboss’s videos are really funny and the invention videos are also my favourite
Fun fact if schools removed the addition for notebooks and removed paper type exams, in my opinion this would most likely save  trees
The paper straws aren't biodegradable 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
The paper is a Rick roll
Great video!
proof humanity still has hope
2:35 i thought it said biohybrid chandler lol
People don't realize this but if we stop eating cows and chickens, pigs they would go extinct. There are more chicken on earth now then there was 22 years ago. There was 14 billion chicken in 2000 and there is a current 24 billion now
00:25 plastic thing
Such a calm voice
Would love to see more videos like this, they're amazing and at the same time gives them publicity to further progress!
7:13 he dosent leave any chance to rickroll us
Where is that powerbank that charges itself 🧐
Love the content material. Also loved the clothing ;)
Rterrttruouoouiu
13:50 to plant 365,000 trees using this drone alone it would only cost 182,500,000
Thank you for this video I was having a pretty shitty day and this video not only restored my mood and not did only gave me fate in humanity but it gave me some pretty awesome futuristic dreams where the world was free of pollution but was bright y sunny and I was sitting in a park and this small girl gave  me a flower she smiled and ran to her mom, I went inside my car and the world was forest straights where hanged by trees and bridges where made of bamboo it was magmatic and the air was so clean it had this smoothy soupy smell
Imagine if someone uses ALL of these inventions in there home. It would be the MOST eco-friendly house EVER.
Just so you know my dad is a logger and that paper wouldn’t save a single tree because because paper is made out of polp which is just shitty wood so The tree is still being cut down
Elephants eat trees
7:10 it's Rick roll😎
Day 1 of finding the rickroll in all of Mrwhosetheboss’ videos: 7:10
The more production of vegetables and greenhouses causes a lot of issues in our world as well meat is not just an issue it’s more plants and the greenhouses
the transparent solar panels sound realy cool. Question is how will they affect other living organisms that are sharing their living space with humans, like Pets and plants? Will plants still thrive when being kept inside the living room? They depend on a far greater lightspectrum than is visible to the human eye.
I’m sorry mate but I’m a nutritionist and making blanket statements like vegetables are healthier than me it’s just incorrect what are you trying to achieve what’s the context what’s the genetics and biome of your subject et cetera. Generally plants will help keep your biometric clock ticking slow which is good for longevity but animal products Are usually a superior choice for athletic types also context dependent of course but the diminishing returns most vegan diets have on your muscle growth over long-term it’s just not worth it if your main dietary goals of the build strength power and muscle. Many athletes have switched to a vegan diet which has yielded them great short-term results in detoxifying from many unhealthy things they eat including things that aren’t just meat vegan diet helps and cut those out but then loss of cholesterol starts to negatively impact Performance over time. I also agree that we seriously need to cut down on the amount of animals we keep and a big part of that is boycotting the unsavoury parts of the meat industry but also reinforcing and supporting those that are actually trying to do good within it, because they do exist. And as far as meat versus vegetables and the research done into it there is just as much bullshit on both sides look at where the funding comes from. McDonald’s pays a lot of money to have people not know about the horrible consequences of their food. And just as much money Is put into hiding all the horrible things that happened to people on these vegan fat diets as well. And when these vegans switch to all meat diet which is not recommended for the average person but is a necessity as far as we can anecdotal detail for people dealing with chronic fatigue and things like arthritis. There needs to be more research done into the health benefits of meet a lot of people are suffering because of the BS diet research that has been displayed in all corners of the food market. And now cancel culture is calling anyone interested in this a lost rebel Trying to save the meat industry they love so much. Which is dumb because all I and many other people suffering to try and have a healthy body or athletes trying to learn to max out their health All I and people previously mentioned want is open conversation about the foods we eat and for the science that is done towards understanding it to not have a bias towards one diet or the other so we can actually learn.  I don’t think we should just find the most cost-effective food that will save the planet at cost of all of our health’s. Instead the research should be finding the absolute most optimum food for humans and find a way to make that sustainable.  Thank you very much for reading this if you did
If I was rich I would build an entire building full of the eco-friendly stuff you put in your videos
That non plastic plate was packaged with plastic
Almost all of the things on the list are retarded with a negligible effect on reducing the human carbon footprint. Some would say even a negative effect since environmentally conscious dumb people may choose to spend their money on these over far more impactful alternatives. The only thing on this list that stands out and may actually have some effect is the mushroom packaging, rated at a pathetic 4/10. The rest are mostly just luxury items, designed to make people feel like they are making a difference while they actually aren't. PV windows? Utterly stupid, for the same cost you could lay down 10x more energy production capacity with traditional PV panels. Why put PV on buildings in the first place? So they can be less efficient with all the shade from your neighboring skyscraper?  Its all about looking like you're doing something.
6:14 will fill every space you have  Mbeast: I doubt that!
I love positive videos
R u holding a peice of paper what is Rick rolling u?
Real heaven...
Nice greek look
nebia one is kind of genius, force the same large amount of water but through 6 small holes meant to scatter them as much as possible, naturally if you pump more water in at the same rate the amount that exits will still be lowered but at a higher pressure, if it can accomplish the same things as a normal one then it's simply better
who was the eleven thousand one hundred and eleventh commenter?!  i need to get mad at them for making me the 11,112th commenter!
4:03 is that Chatime  So biotrem recycled the idea of medieval trenchers, that use bread as a plate
Uh, that drone still requires $25,000 a day
Why can't you show Josh on cam?
M.fuker vegans killing ours foods food.
Your puns are on point tho
they don't clear cut for paper or lumber anymore its actually for farmland
straws make up almost none of the plastic in the ocean...
The biggest contributor of plastic in the ocean is fishing line and other fishing related equipment...
And its almost 10 million... We nèed iphone 11 128gb red giveaway 😭🙏🏻❤️
I don't know, you say love to God but you can play with God's clothes. where respect.
Astaghfirullah,
Arun, will u be ready to live Lifelong in one such Eco-Capsule with me, for the rest of our lives ?  Arun, You mean, trying to climb the Tree of Knowledge!?  We both can, Aim, shake, or Climb a Few Fruit Trees in our Lifetime, like the Apples, Peaches, Mangoes, Sweets and Nuts,  Or, Live in a Tree House, Meditate sitting under a Bodhi Tree, Do Yoga-Exercise-Dancing on A Grass Lawn, Hearing to Birds Sing, Squirrels squeal, Milking cows, Sheeps, breeding & raising Horses, wrapping cobra snakes around our Necks or having Pythons protecting our Heads during a Rainy Season, ... there are several such possibilities and opportunities.
I am not sure about how legit all of the inventions are, but plastic road was definitely debunked
@Mrwhosetheboss after 12, feeling what just thinking about it? 🤔 at 6:47 lmao hilarious….. Also these are all wonderful but… I see you can buy these items. These are the underlying issues. It’s not like people don’t want better but the cost is terrible with inflation. Even if we wanted to change our behaviors. The financial system refuses to allow that to other individuals that have grand ideas. People even steal these ideas and keep them hidden. It’s great you have insight  but this is merely another advertisement with a great script. In a one on one conversation with everyone without a scripted out thought. It’s an easy fumble. I know you’ll never reply to my comments but if you do. I’d love to talk and I’d be fascinated to hear it thoroughly
6:46 Thats what she said
Found you searching for phone reviews but this is such a great video. Great videos all around but this is by far my favorite!
The sad thing about this is that they are not manufactured enough for more people to use
Here is a bonus one that i found: Zipline is the name of a company that is changing the way that blood is carried with drones. Blood expires, there are different types of it, and it needs very specific keeping conditions. Zipline catapults drones with specific blood types, takes them to places all around Africa, and parachutes the blood down to hospitals that need it. 8/10.
Plastic Roads... ?? Hello Microplastics..  But they will be there anyways.. so it's propably good enough. Still: Tar is the better Material. It is recycleable and durable due to its ductility.
Such a good video, and my favourite is meal worms, they are the perfect solution to plastic pollution, and they probably will produce biodegradable materials which can later be used as a fertiliser
Solar freakin roadways remember that 😂
if you abandon meat animals will start to over populate and the whole world would have to many animals
Can I have timestamps?
he pulls a straw out of a plastic bag Amazing
Interesting video
Democrats wreck everything we love. Comics, movies,video games, and now meat. 🖕
I just got a huge dose of Klaus Schwaub from the World Economic Forum.
Hell
Throughout the video I was just smiling,smiling and smiling 😁
HA no lactade for me!am lactose intolerant
I would love another updated video like this
Good to see youtubers like you are popularizing the Philippines nowadays Philippines back then receives least attention on youtubers love your vids keep it up 👍
How did you get S22, it's not even released-
00:43 he made a typo lol
16:13 wait what you had a pet that could only see the light being absorbed so if you kept them inside they would have no natural light?
Love this video bruhhh
Heaven
I have a great invention to replace plastic straws.... don't use straws, you imbeciles.  Drink your drink like an adult.

Thank you so much for the content and the effort ,wwell done. my quick question: the name of the song of the ending cut please, that's the one that makes me want more of your content. much love from Rwanda💜
if the ''solar glass'' becomes All our glass, we be going ahead to 2522
Its sad i waiting for minimum 7 years to hear that plastic road r normaly using....8 years about that plastic degradate enzym worms. That floor .. 4 years, Transparent solar ? 3 years ... All about fucking money.... disgusting. That like that generate fuel from waste. Oil lobby dont allow that
why the song so emotional
the most environmentally friendly straw in my country is lemongrass with a hole in the middle
Keep up the good work 👍
...50 cents a tree... Everyone: He had us in the first half
Imagine walking with that style in the city streets. Everyone one will listen whatever comes out of your mouth.
Is that habessha cloth?
My man really rickrolled us
"He can run roblox on 100 device's"
Better to use bucket bath instead of shower.
You look like an angel
bruh i literally take a 2 minute shower, then a 1 minute drying session.
Did you seriously wear a toga😂🙏🏼
Poo paper is made in sri lanka don't copy my country
You are t(he best)
Part two plssss
I don't understand the biotrem, we can just use glass plates, like... Normal plates which are washable... Who eats dinner in a plastic plate?
0:52 he says he will put it back in his cloud storage witch is ironic bc he is trying too look like an angel and angels live in clouds in heaven HAHA LOL XD
A more accurate title would be 21 Kickstarter scams
People make plastic eating worms People make plastic roads Worms eat the roads xD
7:40 bruh you are a menace
4:09 thats what she said
OMG this your greek cloth makes you sexy
Nice Vid!
whole video of mostly vapourware
Aisa thumbnail Kisa banate hai.
That shot when Arun said "more washing power" that water in those microdroplets looks more pleasing than a normal shower whilst being more efficient
Except the marker didn't work
I just got Rick rolled by a piece of paper
LOVE YOUR CONTENT CAN YOU MAKE A VIDEO OF THE TOP EXTERNAL MICROPHONES FOR PHONE
This video is proof, new technology can reduce or eliminate the reasons for global warming....unless you get a check from Mobil Oil.
Yeeeeah, mealworms sounds like a godzilla tier enemy monster in the making, pretty foreboding if you ask me
First he wears the BTS hoodie, now he brings out the boba tea. Mad respect, Mr, you are the boss
Thanks for this video! The ecocapsule is quite intriguing
i like how the straw got a better rating than a lamp who make the air pure
that plastic road idea is actually really dumb thunderf00t made a great video about it
Eco-capsule eh
Edible straws would be a better substitute than foldable straws 🥺
So close to 10M
Mum might injoy 19 if humans can eat them
We have the concept of water mist in our office where faucets spray water in the form of mist. Unique concept and very less water consumed.
You just got rick rolled
I also hate to break it to but vegan leather does fuck all to save cows. I hate that lie as well, your not saving cows by using vegan leather. When a cow is slaughter, we aren't doing it for its hide like poachers do with foxes or tigers.  We do it for every part of its body, it's skin, organs, bones, meat and even its blood are all used in something that you use every single day. Nothing is wasted. Leather is literally just a byproduct.
Did my guy become a science teacher or still a tech guy he sound like my science teacher
who takes 25 minute showers
1) they are not more durable well known engineering fact 2) they take more energy to produce than standard roads 3) traction is about 10 times worse shall i go on...and on...and on
you had me interesteduntil plastic roads...now it means all the others seriously need looking at...why...because plastic roads are about the most insanely stupid ideas ever conceived...seriously research before you promote lunacy
ever since 2019 when i discovered this channel ive thought "arun seems like a cool guy to have as  a friend"
You make good puns man. Good videos! I especially like the transparent solar panels. Now if we could get rid of all of the stuff in the air that blocks the sunlight. Maybe those pens! Maybe that's going to be.....All-write! (See what I did there?)
Happitat
Elon musk taking notes
Those worms can also eat the plastic roads
catching the shampoo and bodywash was so smooth lol
no chance is hell plastic is more durable than rock mixed with bitumen. 12:18 that idea is dumb on all levels
A lot of these things are scam or do more harm than good Sad to see them promoted so heavily for couple of views
Don’t tell me I have to worry if plates are gluten free now!
Why worm tho
Arun: "whats interesting is not what's inside but what it came in" Xiaomi roasted in 1 line.
you should put the names of the music you use. Great content and great music!
If number one is a 9/10 then whats a 10/10
6:17 people who shower for 2 minutes: 🤔
Your new shirt says otherwise
really appreciate & love this channel by SERIOUSLY?? because this should have been a *COUNTDOWN* list vs. giving a sh%tty score for each one of these amazing projects! I mean, what were you thinking?? what an insult & terrible thing to say, that any of these were less than 10/10!✨✨ because every *single ONE* is something that helps to make the world a better, helpful & environmentally sustainable place:  topics/content: 100%  scoring each featured product: a 100% fail & just smdh.  and I mean, I didn't like the 'featured fashion designs' made re: the recycled plastic ocean pollution but the clothing design is not the issue. it's the IDEA that was carried out that matters. besides, they can always create NEW designs right? so why be so disrespectful re: their efforts.  and still adore you, Arun.💕💕 so, *please,* never do such a thing again re: scoring such amazing projects, pitting one over  and against the others, ever again. because that's just weird & tone-deaf to the overall cause EACH team was working for.😐 which is to make our world a cleaner, safer BETTER world, environmentally.👍
The first  change I notice is his top wear.
Also Facon would mean the taste of bacon would be accessible to a wider range of people, including the billions of Muslims in the world, due to the absence of pork meat in those products.
Arujesus
I love your vids
12:23 damn bro i was gonna guess everclear
meanwhile in 2018, 2019 or sumthin idk: 30,000 HUMANS VS 60 b o t
I like how he said "that's what" XD
11 minutes into the video and I could not identify a product that I would like to have right now.
Number 5 is just from Rick and morty
if they cleaned 30mil trash from the ocean too that means basically 60 million pounds of trash have been removed so far     im proud of humanity
Arun:there is no chance I pronounced that right    Me:no no you did not
In Portland, most restaurants will give you compostable straws or ones made with bamboo.
The shower thing is just a first world problem.
Plastic roads are not very good I think because overtime of use it will create micro plastics
Wow they invented gooble boxes
9:53 ayo! That was smooth...
Nice but some points are just a scam
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news - but plastic road has, sadly, been proven to be a bad idea, many times. It won't do almost any of the alleged benefits (like the ones you're mentioning) while having an army of issues that would make the installment and especially maintenance of plastic roads very expensive and the same time dangerous to use. It's the "solar roadway" type idea: sounds very good, but, sadly, will never be a feasible idea for multiple reasons. Sure, it can be done, and in certain very specific scenarios can - and, indeed do - work, but not for general use.
Is this Repreve company any different than the myriad of other companies that use recycled plastic as raw material to deserve mentioning? That obviously fake "bottles recycled" counter does not count ;)
As I've come from a family that owns a pineapple farm, we just remove the leaves as a whole and replant it, it will grow and have a pineapple fruit on top, rinse and repeat.
This is absolutely amazing, but now the real question is if these amazing inventions will actually be put into action, and be used all around the world, not only by a couple of rich people who can actually afford it.
Amazing video!!!
As you can see we are in the month of February and I feel <those who would allow the market dynamism to determine when to trade or not are either new in space in general or probably just naïve, the sphere have seen far worse times than this , enlightened traders continue to make good use of the dip and pump even acquiring more equities towards trading sessions, I'd say that more emphasis should be put into trading since it is way profitable than hodling. Trading went smooth for me as I was able to raise over 9.2 BTC when I started at 1.5 BTC in just a few weeks implementing trades with signals and insights from John Fredrick, I would advise y'all to trade your asset rather than hodl for a future you aren't sure about or hold it and risk loosing all..learningwashhands
"Says Vegan" Me: NO, NOT THE EVIL,KAREN, RUDE VEGAN TEACHER OH NO OHHH NO AHHHH
I heard about poo paper from nas daily it's also made from elephant shit
Did yall know that you dont need to throw away straws but just yeet them in ur fridge or a container for another time to use I'm just stockpiling straws in the fridge at this point
Great production on this video, but I welcome you to spend a little more time on the space before educating others.
"vegan leather" thatveganteacher: *finally, some respect*
"Still the tastiest plate I've ever had."  This implies you've tried others...  *arun care to explain?*
16:50 mute your video and just watch what he doing
when the meal worms get to the plastic roads:
unpopular opinion but paper straws make drinks taste better
GIVE ME THE MEALWORM ENZYME SO I CAN EAT ALL THE PLASTIC AND BECOME THE PLASTIC GOD AHAHHAHAHAAAAHH
the thing about the mealworm thing is i have a box of them waiting to be fed to my lizard
The trees one mr beast is doing it too And removing plastic He's the #1 youtuber for me.
as maybe some people could tell, the plastic road/bike path was in the Netherlands. being Dutch i thought it was a great idea when first announced, but so many people oppose to it, its insane. and when asked why they dont have solid scientific reasons
You like lndia man
Comment 🚀🚀🚀✊🤙
i love your clothes
Great tech reviews with a hint of comedy leads to a great video to watch.
We will not stop being Rick Roled in a different way 7:12
Recycling plastic bottle to a clothes is not helping the environment. Actually, one of the waste contributor are clothing. It will eventually go back to waste. And melting plastic to turn it to yarn needs a lot of fuel energy.
12:40 But aren't plastic roads make microplastics?
Poo paper is gross ahhhh
One of the best videos In MWTB. And the PAVEGEN  technology is  very interesting. The piezoelectric  sensors in it  converts the pressure to electricity.
"Make sure to eat your plate"
Imagine pavegen in all the gyms out there, your cardio will actually be cardio to earth!!
+ it gathers water from every single time it rains california be like "what rain" 9:35
tell me thats not a bright idea Thats not a bright idea 9:09
Guys there’s a tiny bit of hope left
So the only reason i sub to you is your good video and the fact that you always tryna rickroll us on every single video
13:36 **cries in lactose intolerant**
where can i buy a ecocapsule
veganteacher will love this video
My friends discussing weather you eat the burger or the fries first.  Me saying I eat the plate first.
49% of these seem like a gimmick, 49% like a scam.
if this is not a god complex I do not know what is
That one time you forgave our sins was really cool of you
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE 🙏 Make more of these, I LOVE them
Who is that girl in every his new video?
The first one is not good for your chances for having a baby because it is proven that microplastics reduce sperm count in men
thumbnail shows me something
Plastic roads will never come because it's a dumb idea.
7:41 damn we be getting rickrolled by elephant poop paper now?
Bruh, your weird… and I like it👍🏽
Uhhhh… mealworms aren’t inventions. They’re a good that’s been around for decades. Not anything new. Also poo paper was made before tree paper. (I do love your channel but I just wanted to point out the inconsistency)
I actually had an idea similar to pavegen. I never made it of course and I'm still kid so don't be mad if this idea had flaws. What if there was a device the goes on you chest and the kinetic energy from your heart beating could power things like personal devices. No, it wouldn't connected to your heart. It would be like a normal undergarment you put on in the morning and take for a shower. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
❤
Blow okay but I only take like a bath like 3 minutes and that's good enough for me
14:37 so it's basically just teamtrees but daily
you deserve more likes and views, buddy. definitely
goverment:*introduces drones that plant 20k trees  team trees: ILL TAKE UR ENTIRE STOCK
Amazing! One of the best videos on this channel. Keep up the great work, Arun!!! 👏👏👏
10:11 what about people who are gluten free like me
BRO WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT NUMBER 12?????
I have another reason to not go vegen, B12 is hard to come by and I think salfer as well, and supplements do not count as it is a synthetic version that is not as effective at doing it's job
man we learn a lot from your stupifyingly creative videos
mostly bs
is it just me or is #2 kinda familiar?
12:01 my dad would create none and your mom would power the city
what about the nuke tech activity going on?
tell us more on the solar panel story, interesting
underground plastic tunnels, would be great, spyros panopoulos is doing them (massive double deck highways built with maximum strength using the least volume)
brazil is the capital of plastic oceans
can you do an epsiode on Spyros Panopoulos and the inventions from "anadiaplasis"
Half of these products have already been debunked as trash.
What is the company thats sells the facon?
Nice costume though 😂🤣
Disappointed was expecting better from you
That house pod is cool and all, but what if someone hacks your house 😂
The nebia is cool and all but i cant imagine myself spending 200$ on a shower head :Dd
Yo! Lol why or what ur wearing??
2:40 algea is pronounced al-jee
Is Fakon halal or haram?
U should meet Nasdaily
7:17 no god pls no nooooo noooooooooooo(u got Rick rolled
Re: The Nebia Shower Head. You used as an example an individual taking a "nice relaxing 25 minute shower".  25 Minutes?!?!?!?!?!?!?  Who does this? My teenage daughter only takes 4-5 minute showers and her hair is long enough to touch her lower back.  Geez, try to at least use realistic examples.
So, who noticed that the background has two suns?
🙌🙌🤙👊👊❣️💓
*6:48** THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID*
Why does the carbon ink pen company burn some of the plastic and trap the carbon emissions to make their ink?
youre so cute wearing that angelic lalalala
Of course just like every video lol a rickroll
now I’m happy to know that humans are taking action to solve the problem  instead of focusing and debating about problem and doing nothing 💚🌿🌱
The mainproblem with Carbonemissions is NOT the individual person. That is actually part of a BP campaign. And Im not even joking, BP released a campaign that aimed towards consumers and how larger their carbon footprint would be
My most favorite show.  I love all (Like) your content.  Can you find a solar producing thread?  Seriously,  I saw once over 20 years ago.  Was a study made believe in Japan University.
wo
Number 1 sounds great, but the internet and all things that work in those invisible light spectrums are going to be affected lol
Huel Black Edition IS DISGUSTING DO NOT BUY
1, i shower 2 or 3 minutes and did i hear hot water?🤨😂
10:55 I was like: You’ve eaten plates before?
I hate how uncritical these videos are...
most of these are bullshit gonna be honest lmao
6:46 😀😳
Bruh the poo paper rickrolled us XD
Is he saying  building made alege
Pause on 4:08 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Yeah Brooo 😂 That's What She Said
Man i wish i could get the gloves. Cant wait to see my school to see me putting my hands into a fire next time we go skiing. Lol.
I will take a plate like that just for a fake Tik Tok video. :)))
1:59 epic *y e e t*
Can we just normalize using pails and dipper instead of shower
Mrwhosetheboss: “that will restore your faith in humanity”. My faith in humanity is already gone and cannot be restored.
Me who sometime takes 1 hour showers:tf
I have that shampoo (the green one)
i don't even understand why so many people are still using straws at all, i mean they aren't infants anymore so there's no need for them to suck in their food
How about microplastics?
people are now gonna buy mushroom boxes  for food
Send me links to buy them
My name is Angel and I'm Angelic ig?!
Thank you bro it really good to see some of our people are helping to repent. I was depressed until now
How is no one talking about the insane catch at 1:00? How many takes did that take?
And all of the green product come in with plastic cover and paper boxes 😆😆
Elephant poop are not smelly then cat when u go closer still small smell
We could all do this, but the biggest dent in "saving the world" would be if corporations moved forward and tried these because they're the biggest polluters. One of the biggest scams they've done is making it our problem. Not saying it does not help, but lets look at the real culprit here.
21 Repreve: 0:39 no that couther is the number recycled where they get their bottles from are not advertised so they most likely get them directly form consumers like any other recycling plant or from sorting plants that do the actual part of making the material usable without sorting factories this company will not exist.. they are not uniqe though they are part of a solution though the way they operate has 0 impact on the plastic actually in landfills and ocean. you can make an argument of them preventing the bottles from going there but that is arguable as they are not unique and if they stopped somebody else will and already are doing the same.  20: useless product jsut buy normal solid soap 100 times cheaper and more useful as you do not need to think about the constantly opened container full of soap that you cant use in the shower. you can just as simply poor liquid soap into a glass and personally experience how it is to use this bottle.  19: first product that is an actual solution for a problem.  18: nice concept but remember it has lots of breakable parts and the smaller it is the harder it is to optimize so probably really inefficient. but still every bit helps.  17: oh wow a plant.  16: another great concept. only downside is this now requires a lot of maintenance and it can probably not pay for itself yet. if it can great.  15:good concept as an alternative but remember wooden straws and metal straws exist too and wooden straws have the same property.  14: humans are omnivores not herbivores wee NEED meat to survive if we stop eating meet and go to a complete herbivore diet we die. the only reason we can do it in modern society is we have supplements that contain what we normally get from meat. on a personal matter what is up with vegans hating meat but crave the taste cuz it looks like their favorite past time is to create something that looks and taste identical to meat. if you want to eat something that looks smells and taste like meat why not just eat meat.  13: sure a usable alternative but is it not better to make a new material instead of potentially degrading the product by replicating another. unless the best material this can be used for it fake leather why not use it for a new material that utilizes the ingredients strengths.  12: just like the government says just take shorter showers. i can be in and out in 5 minutes you don't need that much time. turn on the water to get wet turn it off to apply soap turn it on to wash it of and done if you need to scrub you do not always need running water while scrubbing. and if you do you do not need running water over your hole body while doing so. i know for a fact some people love to turn on the water and apply soap with running water this is a waste of water. or do everyone go to the sing turn on the water to wash a pan wet the pan then remove the pan to apply soap and scrub but never turn of the water while scrubbing the pan then use the stil running water to wash away the soap. this is just a waste. simple rule unless the water is actively doing something turn it off. so when you shower and you start applying soap you probably step outside the water spray to not wash away the soap before it can do its job therefore while you apply soap the water is doing NOTHING so turn it off.  11: i dont know but most likely the paper you get from this cost more than the paper you get from normal means. + to my knowledge elephants eat branches and leaf's the same stuff paper is made of just digested so is this not potentially a worse way requiring more wood to produce paper of lower quality. unless i am wrong this means the only use for this paper is lowering the cost of elephants.  10: its a windmill with a built in battery. you get identical performance with a normal powerband and a wind turbine with a usb port and this is actually superior as it can still be used as a normal pwoerbank and you can use whatever powerbank you want.  9: a good idea of the places that get sufficient amount of sun and when it is not cloudy and not winter. why not lets say not use a open air fireplace to make food and just put everything into a metal box you know like a grill.  8: nice idea  but of Corse they ignore the location that affects the power the home can get and the cost of the property and you know no connection to the grid for extra water or human waste disposal.  7: a realy good idea.  6 ok capturing instead of creating is something we have to do with everything that can work this way and it will be a big part of the solution.  5: ok good idea.  4: nice  3: now to fund it seeing as these worms are not taking over landfills i belie they are not getting a lot of energy from the plastic if any so while it can be a solution i don't think it is the best solution as there already exist bacteria that do the same. and bacteria is alot simpler to scale up.  2: nice  1:  nice but normal solar is still the best option as we have ALOT of roofs around the world that is not used for anyhting that prevents you palcing solar on them. and the argument you used against normal solar panels are identical to the argument i can make against that solar cell. and isntead of saying it i can say reguardless of how eficient a panels o na spesific roof most if not ever ytime the panel still produces energy so Shure placing it on this roof gives you 26% more power shrue this means you want to palce it there first but this does not mean the other less efficient roof is useless. longs story short if we palced solar pannels on every roof yo ucan msot likely suply that region completly with solarpannels alone. the only extra thing you need are batteries for when the sun dont shine.
Never been hungrier in my life.
I clicked on this thiking "as if these are saving the world" but I'm playing it while making a game so we'll see...
That reprive jacket is ugly af
YeEt ThE bOx
I've seen poo paper live
This just gave me so much hope for humanity
I just noticed this but food ads like what Aaron did after this video, don't really brag the fact that they're FDA certified. (IF they are in the first place)
im iffy about that soapbottle one though. Imagine you go for a bath and drop that bottle in the tub or something and you end up with a deformed bottle, or worse, it slips out of your hand since you've wet your hair before reaching for it and it just runs around the floor like a maniac
WAIT I JUST NOTICED THERES A BACON COOKING METER IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT OMG. THE LENGTH THAT YOUR EDITORS GO THROUGH
Pavegen is problematic as hell
Isn't number 7 just chapati(roti) with extra steps.
Every asian's solution to showers causing more water expendature:   Use a dipper/tabo and pail/balde
I'd call it pooper instead of poo paper
Isn't the soap bottle gonna "melt" shen showering?
WHY CAN'T I FILM IN LANDSCAPE  WHILE HOLDING THE PHONE IN PORTRAIT? just a suggestion......
All protists lovers be like DID he just call algae a plant
On #7 Gluten intolerant people cannot use it so there is a down side
I love how most of these ideas are focused on improving the environment.
Good morning bro
**That Vegan Teacher Liked That**
04:08 she said.
6:47 that's what
buba
i actually bought a little notebook made of elephant poo and it was pretty good ngl
7:06 I only just realised the bacon counter
How is this guys channel not the number 1 tech channel ? I love this guy.
Imagine you see someone eating a plate like it’s normal
Imagine if the facon was just fake and the company tricked everyone into eating meat
This is the most comprehensible, well balanced and straight to the point explanation of a complex topic that I have ever seen. Exceptionally well done.
If a person bought Transparent glass  from wish gets regular glass
👍❤️👍❤️👍❤️
The straw fear is annoying the data was all made up by a dum kid. And everyone believed it  with looking at the data
Who...grills with the top off? That is an easy way to get poorly cooked meat.
I think the tree planting drones are pretty cool but it would take $1,000,000 to plant the 20,000 trees per day
the first one is a social enterpreneur
Aren't the inventors of the first item in the video (plastic bottles to clothes) just delaying the inevitable?  Sooner or later the shirts are gonna go straight to the bin... But I do agree if they continue to keep on doing this, then it will indeed keep the cycle going and help the environment..
Really good video my favourite of all time
I dont like how the videos are THEMED!!
How many people are watching from the US admiring his accent?
When will all these products come to the market. Can I buy any of them today ? Thanks
Thanks for this Roman Senator !
Plastic road isnt that great thats because When it breaks down It produces Microplastics which will be more harmful for us humans to breath and can end up in foods we eat
So is an alive building very godly?
50k for a house? In serbia you can get a 2 storie house for 50k
What about food water air that they poisoning?
Pinatex is not a company, it is the name of the textile. Pineapple + textile = Pinatex. Pinatex comes in a variety of forms but is usually in the form of vegan leather as you said :)
but algae creates glucose, so are we going ot have sugerie buildings?
Damn bro mr beast gotta step up their game
AAHHH SO CLOSE TO 10 MILL SUBSCRIBE!
His costume tho 😂😂
We can also say that sl8 is also heavenly inventers cuz they make paper out of stone
it not a mistake ✨it’s a master piece
it not a mistake ✨it’s a master piece
People piss in dirty bottles ect so hell no
“Don’t be racist I’m a building”
13:34 it not milk-
Damn I’m impressed
Can I get a phone
All of this is really cool, but I don't see most of it working in a country that's not rich, or full of people that have a lot of free time on their hands.
Just so you know ... saying plastic roads is a good thing is so stupid. It's just waiting until it turns into microplastics. And that's terrible for the environment. Just look at recycled plastic projects today to see it's inevitable and terrible.
You seem like using your index fingers more than your mouth. Keeps me drifting of focus. :D
Where did u get the Jesus dress bro
A lot of those are just scams/fake, the tree planting one is an aberration.... For the solar pannels there's so much to take into account that just blindly say it will revolutionnate everything is just being naive, sorry to say....
Plastic Road be like: It takes 500 years to get rid of me. Meal worms be like: Hahaha, that's cute.
Heh, cloud storage
I don't know how you rank the inventions. You ranked Recycling of plastic to cloth as 21 last rank , 🙄
Only YouTuber that makes me actually wanna buy their sponsors stuff
The thumbnail is fire
Thought we was going to say biodegradable buildings. lol
6:47 🤣🤣🤣
6:53 cat claw his hand see the scar
4:07 top right quarter of the screen in the center XD
the plastic roads sound like a scam to me
Heavenly feelings 🤪
Glass is a big problem then plastic
1:49 NO THEY TOOK MY MUSHROOMS AWAY
The powerbank fan looks dangerous for kids etc.
His outfit made me wonder if am on the correct channel??😂😂😂😂
This video was great and all, but where did you get that costume?
I actually knew of poo paper since 2014. I think this elephant dung paper existed a long time ago
Huh
I mean I'm all for the tree-planting drones, sounds like a great idea. But 20,000 trees a day means one tree every 4 seconds. Isn't that a bit dubious?
I would go vegan if one pack of sausages wasn't 4 pounds or if one burger wasn't 2 pounds. I don't live in England I just converted the cost so it's easier to understand
The “visible” portion of the EMSpectrum is such a small portion and is quite honestly not very energetic to boot, but if we can harness those parts that are higher or even lower in the energy spectrum it’ll be something spectacular!
The cloth he wore in this video........ah, I cant ..................
Why do so many big youtuber bought in the false "recycling plastic" .. the problem is not just plastic litter but rather stacks from making it to using it to post consumer use. The only solution are going Reuse and Refill - or in general moving toward Zero Waste Economy (yes it's a thing, look it up).   Did you know when you use plastic to make cloth or shoes it discarded microplastics and nanoplastic whereever it goes and ended up contaminating even more !!!!!! .... it's called plastic degradation -> Physical, Thermal and Photodegradation (Look it up)
How the hell did a shitty straw get higher then a building powered by algae
At 02:40 when he mentioned Chandelier, there was a pop up of Chandelure, a pokémon 😂
0:40  Team seas: o-o
Arun:”21 heavenly inventions” Also Arum: “mealworms”
What about QEGs?
Number 7 takes the “eat the whole plate” to a new level
You are quickly becoming one of my favourite YouTubers, I have been binge watching your videos (on my iPhone 5), and when I say binge watching I mean I have mostly been watching your videos (don’t worry I take time away from my phone), and this has to be one of, if not my favourite videos you have made, love your content
Terrible video. After 124 seconds I can't listen to this any longer,  with that racket in the background. SO I WIll UNSUBSCRIBE TO THIS COCOPHANY OF SOUNDS terrible. Are you trying to brainwash everyone with your sound agenda. The background music is competing with your voice.
we need the 2th one the tree planer drone in middle east please ♥
Man u you believe half of these concepts  you need to watch all of thunderfoots busted videos
Giving recyclable bottles to clothes product is 2 is damn wrong man . That is one of the great environmental invention 🙄
next do evil inventions, maybe like facebook, mobile games, then find something super bad
14:17 Mr Beast would be proud.
nice costume boi
I like his dress more than the products😅😅
Your ratings are not good Try to stop doing that
1:01 man didnt even looked
Arun out of context be like:        "Im feeling wet just thinking about it" 😳😳😳
I love Arun's British Accent 🇬🇧🇬🇧
Fuck paper straws. They use it at cinemas here and I gotta drink from the cup it self
the plastic clothes company should really colab with savetheseas
im so glad that was uploaded on my birthday ,15 Jan
"im feeling wet just thinking about it" 😐
there is a thing i saw a while back about artificial trees that are more efficient than real trees
Those things are really cool but the true hidden process of making them isn’t at all, that’s the ugly truth. We can never be truly green at all, just my honest opinion based on legit research.
i need plastic straws to make my creations with cardboard.
Lol I honestly have to know why clothes/fashion are seemingly moving backwards to… the 80’s…?? Gen Z does nothing but trash the intelligence of all of us born back then, but they’re happy to assume that we had great fashion sense… in what might have honestly been the WORST decade for style since the inception of wearing clothes haha 😂 🤦🏻‍♂️
Try cooking the mushroom from the package of xiaomi
He rickrolled us on a piece of paper made of poo. DEDICATION
Disagreeing on the plastic road one cause it's pretty stupid to make road out of plastic cause tires exert alot of kinetic energy which in result throws lot of microscopic plastic into the atmosphere so i think the plastic road thing might be a disaster for future.
Did you know that algae makes so much oxygen that even if all the trees in the world were cut down we would still have enough oxygen to live by?
Wow
But the straw is paper and they are not using plastic that 1 thing but they are using paper and paper is made with chopping down trees so that’s useless
10:10 - replacing plastic tableware, comes in a plastic wrapping
Wind tree is so carbon intensive from all the steel but produces so little energy, it takes over 50 years to break even
So we no longer have plastic straws wrapped in paper just paper straws wrapped in plastic.......
Has anyone done a careful study of "vegan leather". If the process involves heavy use of chemical and lots of water or if it produces lots of dangerous waste  Then it might be more eco-unfriendly.
I am concern about many vegan food. When I eat them, after I do a number 2 in the toilet. My poo has a weird chemical scent. My poo also have a similar scent when i drink soy milk. I'm concern of the chemical that is use in the making of the product.
Za warudo
Did he just fling a pineapple fruit like that? That better be plastic and not the real thing
And did nobody saw rick astley printed on the poo paper ᕙ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ᕗ
It's how he catches those bottles without even looking and whilst still talking for me. Makes me wonder if he really did that or that was just edited into the video
He's lactose intolerant 😂😂😂
I one time went to a greenhouse with transparent solar panels it was cool
4:09 *she said*
this is adorable! how have i never seen this channel before? just adorable!
I have a book of that poo paper, you can barely see the difference.
Did I just got Rick rolled ?  Lol😅
0:56 -  Arun - lemme put this in my CLOUD STORAGE LMAOO how can you get these jokes dude LOL.
13:57  If I'm not mistaken I think I heard about that a couple years ago The seeds are encased in a nutrient rich ball and then deposited If they have perfected it the prospects are truly incredible.
12:22  You know they say plastic takes 500 years to breakdown Yet I've had plastic products (fans ect) that actually break down and deteriorate in my hand
7:11  Oh shit😲  I wonder If the dung from other animals can be used in a similar fashion.
6:34  nebia  I wonder what's the cost of that shower
Fake beacon is an interesting idea everything pulls resource from something else If it catches on more agricultural land would be needed to produce the plants at least the pigs would be happy.
0:53 Why did Aaron have to find the ugliest outfit of the company to display.
I would love to see you putting research into these videos. A lot of the things you showed (obviously not all of them) are actually dramatically overpromising their impact, to the point that some of them don´t even stand on solid ground when it comes to the thermodynamics. And you really can´t discuss that, one can talk about financial viability all day long, but if it´s thermodynamic nonsense (like the algae chandelier) you really shouldn´t even consider it in a list like this. Obviously you can just create a list of ideas that sound cool to you, nothing wrong with that, but then you should not claim that they will "save the world" or have even the slightest impact. When it comes to saving the planet and fighting climate change there are so many scams out there that try to sell you stupid solutions that might sound proper, but when observed more closely are nothing but hot air. So it would be great if you could fact check these claims instead of just repeating unfiltered what these companies claim.    I get that this video is probably done in good faith and also that i might expect too much from a video that is made for entertainment purposes. But still one can always hope ...
0:10 Personally I don't think anything would Restore my faith in humanity
I'm probably not going to switch to going vegan cuz one problem is that overpopulating could happen
Number 7 has a downs side if you cant eat gluten like me
And the Oscar for category "Hype" goes to....
Mealworms aren't an invention
There is exactly 1 problem with #7: it's incompatible with those that have celiac
6:48 🤨
Foldable straws are in the right direction, but honestly, I would really be one to carry a STRAW with me everywhere I go. Should have been lower than the algae lights
6:22 awesome. Super small droplets of water being flung at me at sonic speeds. (Not making fun, it sounds really cool, just thought that it sounds funny)
I'm going to guess the girl edited into the stock footage of the bbq party is his girlfriend ;) 8:30
this is my fav youtube video
In 4:09 there a secret text in the screen it's just soo camouflaged
this is basically an ad for 21 dif items
Also the plates how much do they cost for a box of them and what is the box made from. Also how is the plate made 🤔. I question it cuz you buy organic foods they are not truly organic most times they are allowed to use so much chemicals on them and still be called truly organic. So how much energy is used to make a plate compare it with paper plates and other plates. These ideas you are calling calling amazing get all the facts to share to see how amazing they really are or if it's just a sham that creates more harm than it's saving.
Also the shower head how does it create higher pressure and more pressure 🤔. And I use low pressure head that has mist setting which is same thing. But I use garden hose to clean my car but to make it cleaner I use pressure washer which creates more pressure out of smaller nozzle but uses far more more in shorter time so how much pressure that shower head creating and how much you saving if anything.
The air pen I have issues with. How much energy is used to make it and what and how is the pen of. I feel like it could be using more than it's saving
Stop Rick roll me when I watching you I can't even watch your video without seeing that guy at your video
real christiansonly 2006
Plastic roads is not a good solution...plz do some research..
Never ever i.m gonna wear fake leather
Hey can you do a video about these new spambots
Fun fact you’re watching this in 720p
Save the world or save us? The world would be a lot better if we weren't here. It doesn't matter what tech or magic bullets we come up with, our greed, our laziness, our apathy will win in the end. Ever notice that doing the right thing is always the more expensive option?
Cloud storage
Hopefully, you reach 10M subs Arun! Your videos are awesome.
WELL veri good wel see ..   in time ...
Wow, that's some Brilliant stuff
I just see it as him jumping on the green band wagon for Extra brownie points
Really, if you want to reduce plastic, just use a cup made out of ceramics or wood or whatever you desire.. Wash it out after every use and with soap on the end of the day.. Like they did some 100 years ago?
Power banks can actually charge themselves
Plastic roads more durable than current roads? Yea that doesn’t sound accurate.
Ppl cook with charcoal for more flavour so ye
Anime theme 😄
My mom bought me a poobpaper book 18 years ago lol
man your clothing took me aback at the start of the video itself
i love how there is rick astley on the poo paper
when it is summer, the plastic roads become sticky right ???
I hate high pressure low water showers.  I miss being absolutely drenched with high power high volume water.
What Cheapest house costs 50k euro.. it is equal to 1 crore pakistani rupees for such price we can have a huge house of 500sq yards .
a minute of silence for the plastic wrapping of the Biotrem plates.
i swear to god plants and saving us
You are doing best
😅
Technology like this makes me very happy!
Incredible mushroom package that helps solving one of the worst problems in the word: 4/10  Fuckin vegan bacon : 6/10
There is no way I'm going Vegan
I love your TeamSeas sweater!
Vegan bacon and paper straws just suck
10:01 don't worry I'm just saving my point
Any spambots, if you are reading this, go commit stop spamming
Oh Greek God
Solar panels are the worst! Nuclear energy FTW!!
Best channel....🌬He Lowkey cute...handsome 🥲❤️❤️❤️❤️🥴🥴🥴
Bro where the heck do you get this information xD
Because of you all I talk about is phone you are the best tech YouTube EVER
wtf was this video and video concept. These videos can't continue anymore, can they?
wish I could give you 21 likes on top of the one I gave you for the video.  Thanks from John and Ashly in Calgary, AB, Canada. Cheers!
❤️
they should make glasses using transparent solar panels that you can charge your phone with
Wind Tree reminds me of the animation Lorax
I talked about Air Ink and Pavegen at case competitions back in college. Awesome to see them here and how far they've come!
I think he should also review food
I will never be vegan (only for food)
I got goosebumps so bad watching this video! I feel good about the future and it is only getting better as people who want the world to degrade are getting too old and going away.
This dude's awesome! Good narrative, no unnecessary sporadic pointing and dumface no gimmics. Just the guy doing the deal real entertainment. Thanks man!!
😵 the Huel bag is PLÁSTIC 😵
many of these so called inventions are BS and haven't been proven.  Stating them as actual solutions says a lot for the content creator's trustworthiness.
Oooooh....SEXY🥰
My god, you’d think finding out you won the lottery is the best feeling of the world, but I am ELATED to have heard 21 NEW WAYS OF SAVING THE WORLD
All these amazing tech make me live in hope that the world will one day be a better place. Also your passion for tech shines through making all your videos very entertaining to watch everytime, please keep producing more content you are one of the best youtubers around.
I swear people are going to make everything so much more difficult, saying you should become anti-plant abusive or some sh-
Arun is basically Ryan Reynolds but tech-focused and non-American
YES FAKON! my brothers wife’s cousins husband was the person who found how to put bacon flavor in different things. opening the gateway for bacon flavored inventions
Where do I buy that attire? There's no link in the description
I want an EcoCapsule
13:55 BAUM =D
What's up with all those very similar and copied comments? Most just repeat after one another, and maybe like a few are original.
Cows aren’t raised for their leather. Leather is a byproduct of the meat and dairy industry. People should reduce their consumption of meat instead of reducing their leather use. That would be a more effective at reducing livestock use.
this is a very good video.. please make more of these...
He’s just like a news reporter 😂
wait, wait so if a plastic water bottle takes 500years to break down then the water bottle i am holding rn will live long then wtf?!?!?!?!?
Where can I buy Facon ? :)
Mushroom packaging deserves to be MUCH higher on the list
in indonesia there are paper straws
Hope restored :)
bruh didnot see the rickroll coming anyone else noticed it
Yeah, Vegan foods.... the amount of salt in most of them is why not :) Also I have a housemate with a super rare allergy for something that's usually used as a conservative.
Why burn pineapple leaves?
Vegan leather is actually when a hippy lets their pants get so dirty it looks like leather because of the oils and everything in it.
NO IT'S NOT!! FACON TASTES LIKE A BACON DOG TREAT!!
15:22 special glass
Water form the Zäpfhane is not drinkable due to fluoride and aluminumiones that are contained in large armounts, as the law allows large amounts in it.
Why are you disguised as JULIUS CÄSAR?
Another triple A video =)
So the transparent solar panels wont let the heart to get in that may increase problem for inside heating and the energy produced from them will be used to maintain temperature in side
What a costume!! 😃😃
Your accent is very weird and artificial. Don't mean negativity or exclusion but it's weird 😂
I remember in one of your past video's your mentioned something about your channels name and "maybe" that you mispelled it somehow 🤷 "Mrwhosetheboss"  I was reading it the other day and I read "Mr-who-set-he-boss"💁
The eco home looks like majin buu house brought into reality
12:36 This was already debunked and it's a horrible idea. There's a reason why roads are not only the surface, but also layers and layers of foundation beneath. Besides that plastics are not good at handling the extreme wear and tear from elements, extreme temperatures, presssure, and friction. Plastics are good at being light or bendy. None of those qualities are sought after in roads that are supposed to withstand years and years of cars driving over them 0/10
11:53 I remember pitching and Idea exactly like this in secondary school for a regional physics competition. The problem to solve was "generating energy from cars driving over a bridge". I didn't even make it through the qualifying round...
14:42. So mrbeast scamed us?!?!?
Not questioning your opinion but I personally think that numbering of these products are not good some need to go up and some down
Fuck yea, Mr.Boss going vegan letsgoo
The tree one is amazing but theres one catch. Companies that take down trees KNOW what they are doing, they know that if they just keep taking down trees they will end up not having them anymore. So most companies also replant every tree that they take down, even if it is not in the same place.
WindTrees : Windtraps from dune
This was phenomenal! :) Thank you for putting this together for us. So much greatness.
Was I just rickrolled by poo paper
Dil.... that can generate electricity by shaking......
Hello  Kratos is behind you
They missed an opportunity to call the poo paper "Poopyrus"
Angelic
Imagine a world where every Infrastructure is built like this. I feel like that would impress any aliens that are spying on us.
12:00 pavegen hmmmm sounds like a rick and morty episode.
i love that hes wearing a team seas shirt
100% the fakon is so expensive nobody who doesn't work as a CEO will not be able to afford this.
Getting rickrolled in a poo paper ah what a freqking luck
Great Video
This was quite good.
TayZonday comment ‘He picks a wardrobe first and asks “What tech video would fit this costume?”😄’
Lol TayZonday removed comment
Rick roll isn't funny anymore
Котка
we love eating cows :P
No. 11: how to turn "sh*t" into "sheet".  They'll really great ideas, I can't wait to see them widely used around
6:52 okay i dont know why but, whille watching this section for some reason i remember watching people using elephant dung as a material for a plate on tv
9:10 egg
the "wasted" part of the box sold me to this one
Poo paper ? People seriously need to start washing their ass, you already have an invention for that, its called a bidet
OMB
Plastic road is one of the worst ideas. Constant friction creates a steady supply of microplastics that will poison the surroundings and contaminate the food chain while at the same time easing the consience of people using plastics and thus perpetuating the problem. And the repercussions will be irreversible. Btw, presenting ecology subjects dressed in all kinds of plastic is ironic, don't you think? Plastic digesting enzyme and solar glass are the best inventions presented here and true game changers. I hope they will be available asap
vegan leather      thatveganteacher dream
Feeling wet? 😂😂
The last one was really big brain time
Girl arun lol
6:46 was the perfect time for a that's what she said joke
Yeah but the problem with these are either their fake , they failed because there wasn't enough interest on it , or they're just expensive
in 16 u can have ur own casita
10:31 when you're hungry but you only have a plate to eat
Lov3 it But just pick up litter when you can and all the other grunty sustainable efforts none of these inventions can beat traditional captain planet type of principles
You haven't posted the links to the vegan bacon and the edible plates!!!
These are just insane tech, especially the tree planting drones. Long Live Humanity
My name is Arup and as a matter of fact, I am an architect too!
that ink idea is a scam folks
There is no way that I would ever use paper made from elephant dung
Who tf takes a 25 minute shower?n
Nice catch and nice info
So why do we say aljeee in the us?
thunderf00t is gonna have a great time with this video...
The best straw is no straw!
Could've atleast said something else than "I'm feeling wet just thinking about it"  😂
Another invention:   Good 60$ AAA Games
Animal proteins feed brain cells, so if you go vegan you'll be killing more brain cells than drinking enough alcohol to filling 1,000 Olympic size swimming pools and smoking 1,000 packs of cigarettes a day
LEARN HOW TO PRONOUNCE ALGAE
The should be 22... since... we are 2022... :/
Brilliantly done ✅
Wtf do British people really pronounce algae with a hard G ? Thats extra
That soap catch was wild
Straws. How about not using it at all.
Does anyone see my comments?
Yeah try and cook with solar in the UK!
1:08 There is a secret text that says "liar".
we take bath not shower
Quizvraag voor de Nederlanders, waar is de parkeerplaats op 12:50?
Earlier I was big fan of his information videos. Now he changed himself a tiktoker. Very annoying presentation.
@12:00 Pavegen should tile Manhattan's sidewalks:-)
I love how much effort and thinking arun puts into his outfits, like once as he startet with a shirt, then a bow tie and at the end of the video a full suit … I like that kind of alongside entertainment while delivering valuable information
2:10 (thneedville sound intensifies)
:))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
ayo man got hacked
Twizzlers make the best bio degradable straws.
Huel Shaker is made of Plastic though Arun
Shouldn't have messed with Escobar lol .. They hacked u
Dude got hacked
what was that crypto video?
Whats one world cryptocurrency
Did you get hacked
Whoever came up with the thumbnail is a legend
14:39 MrBeast should have used those to plant trees quickly
6:54 ITS FROM SRI LANKA YO
Hmmm I think 18 was already invented🤣🤣
"No I did not"
Great work Arun!
"Im feeling wet just thinking about it"  me and my dirty mind: 😳
Best video ever👍👍👍👍
am i the only one feeling uncomfortable enjoying this video and the tech presented during a global pandemic?  it's so weird. great video... but it's so weird
GET OFF OF PLASTIC STRAWS!!! They are sanitary, can be made out of a corn plastic that will break down, and HAVE YOU TRIED TO SUCK A SHAKE THROUGH A PAPER STRAW??? Most vegan leather is VINYL!!! Wind is great, and can run up to 24/7 Most houses should have them in addition to Solar. Good on them That poo paper is brilliant! The Ecocapsule should have wheels on it and be used as a trailer instead of a house. Plastic roads are grand, assuming they can handle a truck maneuvering on them. You can't discuss solar without acknowledging how toxic it is to make them. Better to work on making them more efficient than transparent.
has anybody noticed those pineapple farmers and the vegan leather product? they're from the Philippines. and the logo DOLE is a filipino government called Department Of Labor and Employment. proud to be a filipino.
8:00
Mrs Charlotte's is legit and her method works like magic I keep on earning every single week with her new strategy.
arun i wait for  your top (insert number) tech viedos they are so intresting and cant wait for new ones
I do believe P&G water purifications packets should be on this video too :)
Thanks for the info!
:)
What's faith
the amount of heaven jokes
Am I the only one who finds 25 minutes for a shower rediculous? I mean I don't need more than 3 minutes for a shower 5 max. In the summer I can complete a shower in 90 seconds 1 minute and 30 seconds is all it takes to get wet, lather on soap and rinse it off. Unless I have gotten extremely dirty that is.
I want the iPhone xs sooo bad
Those fake meats have a massive carbon footprint and make the faux meat texture with seed oils which are not only horrible for farming practices but also for your health.  The study that accused meat of having that enormous carbon footprint had that portion of it retracted. Plastic road is a total nonstarter of am idea for too many reasons to list here. Thanks for the vid but most of this is just greenwashed nonsense.
16 is more like creepy
3:33 I thought we were talking about tech today, not weed,.
2:29 Haha I’ll bet you did, bro!
I want to try that Facon....
6:47 *among us theme plays*
2:02 mushrooms can easily kill my mom and so the allergist doesn't even want to test me or my sisters for mushrooms. -8/10
WAT
none of this tech will ever see mass adoption.
I actually had the chance to try a Nebia showerhead not too long ago and I gotta say it's trash. It's made of plastic, feels really cheap, water comes out cold and pressure wasn't good.
6:47 your puns are enough to make you time-spent worthy...
Theres more “I promise” than views in this video
Hey why are u dressed like Zeus?
Team sea and team trees
can you just imagine how beautiful the world would be if we used all of these inventions?
13:35 IM LACTOSE INTOLERANT. You are being lactocist Unsubscribing       Jk
2:18 This is art, not energy generator. It will never recover the amount of energy it took to built it. And it's expensive as f@k.
Yea I’m not using paper made from elephant shit
what is the deal with that ringing sound!?
Tree planting drones yo Mr beast needs this
6:44 - that un-satisfied face 😂 they were thinking "wtf is this drizzle"
16:40 big buys big health. i dont think i ever tasted tapioca
If I bought a hat made from vegan leather I could tell everyone, “well I’ll eat my hat.”
Great videos as usual, but top 3 kinda sucked this time.
Hmm... burnouts on a plastic road
The amount of puns is flipping outrageous that he doesn't even know when he's making a pun
This man loves saying suss shit, and im here for it
I acutely have a poo paper note book and it is so so cool!
Gotta second that this was an absolutely exquisite video. Well done A!
I am amterials engineer and plastic roads are scam. Especially the claim about being more durable. They are less durable than literally everything we use for road construction on top of it it generates way more dust than other materials. And what is wrong with asphalt? You can recover over 99% of it and use again.
Honestly I am always clicking this video is because of how the video is presented if you know what I mean
The sweet is loading.....  Waiting for 10M 😊
This is the first time I've had to click dislike on a video. Most of the video is just fine, however, when you got to plastics you have some glairing innaccuracies and false claims. Over 90% of the plastic found in the ocean does not come from ANY country who is conserned with polution. Plastic roads, regardless of the storage capacity, cannot solve the flooding problem. That has to do with elevation of the road itself.
Can you please link these inventions?
me hwo is lactose intolerant
HEY LAST TIME I CHECKED HE HAD 9.65 or 9.56mil subs and now he has 9.7. Mil
My vocabulary is getting stronger....😎
the meal worm was discovered years ago probobly 65 or 6 years ago
Aaron just likes a lot of puns😂
liked instantly because of your outfit.
Yep just cut it by four
Anyone else notice that almost all of his videos are sponsored?
Thanks for sharing these new ideas ! Keep up your good hard quality work!
God for life
One of best daily yt channels like im getting so much good info. i kinda like it when i realise that i dont waste my time in like nothing i got really usefull info and i respect this man. :)
Sort of scaping the Barrel there! Stick to what you're much better at. It sort of sticks in the throat with your hypocrisy - you are normally pimping the virtues of possibility one of the most environmentaly unfriendly inventions of the last 30 yrs namely cellphones. With their built in obsolescence in terms of hard and software, and their closed architecture......
I rarely comment under the videos but I would say this video is a master piece 👍🤍
am i the only 1 that got rick rolled at 7:10
This is nice and all, but after a few years of practical testing, half of these will show up in another one of your "fail" videos.
11. Poo paper I feel bad for the people that eat paper and accidently
Yes
Transparent solar panels, sounds like a different universe, that's amazing!
I love these kinds of videos. They are so informatif and so positive. They Make us still believe in humanity. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
A lot of this stuff sounds pretentious as fuck.
4:40 no, its not bacon, you probably got paid to say that, vegan foods taste godly awful
Wow, thumbnails really do matter, i would have never clicked on this if the thumbnail wasn't so funny.
So what if there is a mealworm outbreak and they go haywire and eat everything plastic that is needed
.
I'm not sure any of these ideas scale
nice costume
can i get 13 pro max for free please please
Are you trying wuxia trend
now do the invention that will destroy the world
Can you try to stop on the plastic road you just drift into some guy
So no one's talking about how he rick rolled us in poo paper?
u r tech jesus
I must've almost disagreed with every word you said
6:48 WHAT DID HE SAYYY???
Mrwhosetheboss, I think this is the most factually inaccurate video i have ever seen. I am scared for our future! These companies presented solutions are not good or comprehensive enough to live sustainably. It teeters on green-washing! Plastic roads are a Terrible Idea! They are not nearly as structurally sound as asphalt or concrete roads. You should know asphalt is the most recycled material in the world.
Saving cow ❤️🙏🎉
Lovely to see Slovakian invention in form of the capsule house.
I think mr beast already solved number two🤣🤣😂😂
Why rate the first four so badly? I think they're genius
Ditch the outfit
Yeah well..that Facon probably has the whole periodic table inside of it, watch what you eat.
you have picked up the wrong theme
u look like nas daily
Useful information and nice Heavenly theme and Tunic!
U know it's rude to point
Plastic road will be a bad idea due to friction from car tyres this will cause huge air pollution with tiny fragments of plastics everywhere in our environment.
"You wanna know what I've been drinking under the table?" "Bleach."
Now these are rlly cool but I still believe that there is more bad in the world then good
Faith in the survival of humanity restored
They should take a whole truckload or the biggest container they have and just dump the worms on garbage island and let them just devour that big heap of garbage and that would probably solve our problem with garbage island
"I Promise"
I all ways thought how we been managing all these materials for years we have to run out some point I wonder that
the Carbon out put actually speeds the production of how fast our crops grow. ALso another one will be tree houses and flying cars and being to use Spider String from Goats :)
Fun fact: moss is a better version of trees
was anyone around when mealworms were invented
Are you trying to look like Julius Cesar ?????
7:10 “never gonna give you up, never gonna let you doooown!” Nice XD
P.s DO NOT EAT MUSHROOM BOX THEY DO NOT GET YOU THERE
At 12:57, I'm noticing that the shot doesn't look good, like Arun wasn't shooting in RAW then tried to colour correct it. Fantastic video regardless though!
Imagine a phone with that invisible solar panel as a display, You could charge it outside!
Who even figured out how to make vegan leather
Recycling plastics is good. But won't clothes when washed re-release microplastics into the drained water and since the treatment-plants can't filter out microplastics it will end up back in the oceans anyway? And the erosion of plastic roads and pavements will also be washhed out to the oceans as microplastics.. Hmmm 🤔
I can't tell how many puns he does per vid because the quality he has in the video.
This gives me hope for the future
I wish I could make a channel that is literally just a commerical and have it also be entertaining.
About the drones: deforestation rate seems to be about 10 billion trees per year that we need to plant to reach net zero. We actually only need 1370 drones to get there. And with a price of $.50 per tree, that's 5 billion dollars a year. Actually seems kinda doable with these drones
Did I just get Rick rolled by.... POOP
good vaporware
Number 9 was Dani the milkman's idea
More like fakeon
The mushroom packaging box you can throw away save the planet 4/10 tell great thunberg that 🤔
I just wish I was billionaire so I could fund most of this projects
half of the pictures are either girl mrwhosetheboss or rick assley
Be honest, how long did it take to get this shot?
Great video! But eating the facon and that plate ... who hurt you ? 😢
Ahahah bruv, who keeps throwing you these items in every video consistently?! Give that man a Bells 😂….
I love how you put your female face when you were talking abt barbecue
Irony of the video is that it ended with @Mrwhosetheboss sponsoring a product in a PLASTIC bottle.. 🤣
👏👏👏👏👏👏
@13:34 I'm lactose intolerant and I'm offended 😉
@1:58. Plants don't eat mycelium LOL
Do you have a link to the eco houses? I want to buy one when I have to move house.
well in my country it rain 10 times a year on avereg so wuts the piont
Arun:Talking about plastic management.... Also Arun: wearing plastic crown
If anybody still has an excuse to not go Vegi/vegan then theyre just fools
Society: wow now I can go vegan!     Muslims: I can finally eat bacon!
How does a power bank save the world
Feel good mumbo jumbo .. A for trying .. Z for not diving in further
14:00 An OWL! Now I love you even more!!!😘😘😘
Why do i keep on feeling you are about to cry everytime we are into a new invention?
The nebia omen is nothing new, and, the downside of it is that the pressure makes the shower head move air quickly, and, hot water gets cooled quickly as it's coming down, while you also get blown with air.
Damn, he fell for a lot tech scams.
Awesome
Awsomee
interaction
Related to number 15 I went to get ice cream yesterday and They had plastic straws, paper straws and pasta straws and of course I had to try the pasta one and it was actually very good and maybe even better than the plastic ones. So I’m on side pasta straws now until something other better comes and replaces it
dat facon timer ⏲
paper straw sucks
As great as this is my faith in humanity can never be restored and all i had to do to shatter my faith in humanity was open youtube shorts
fakon and poo paper i have no faith in, the wind turbine battery looks like one of the common scams as well as smart home. plastic roads sounds good but i don't think that would work when it comes to wear and tear, i belive old stone roads would be better or modern concreat. lastly Mealworms that eat plastic gives me conflicting feelings about if it's good or bad. out of all of these i beleave the Algi Lamps are the most clever
Wow not insulting to Christians at all
Don't take me wrong ,, but I love you brother ❤️✨💎
No. 5, I think it will take more power to walk on it.
Won't the plastic road melt in the sun?
8:08 i just noticed in the bottom right corner…
14:00 cool idea but birds get killed because glass
Did he become the vegan teacher ?
This is a great channel! I only caught sight of you folks in recent times, but it’s now among my favourite channels.
Imagine having a household problem where you children keeps eating the plates lmao
Plastic roadways isn't really something i would like to invest in. Asphalt is a highly recyclable material, and is a composite material made up of small rocks and bitumen, while plastic is an inherently soft material which would wear down fast under heavy traffic. Has already been debunked by Thunderf00t.
the huel bag is plastic
04:09 behaha
The problem with vegan leather is that they use plastic substance for the finish result which defeats the point of environment friendly
getting Theranos vibes from these
Not gonna lie but i'v never seen a plastic plate in my life
Not me reading mealworms as material worm
Can you eat facon raw?
Allah put animals on this earth to be slaughtered, Not saved.
What was up with the video at 8:29?
Is the Poo paper thingy a Sri Lankan product?
When he said “why wouldn’t I go vegan?” I thought he was going to say that vegan teacher
Why he is wearing ghagra as a top😂
Hi
nice
He always finds a Way To rickroll Us
Don't throw food
It's cute that you think that all the world's problems can be solved with these. Which one of these solves the problem of true evil?
question how do i hold the soap bottle with out it sliping away lol?
I forgot that he's the best in Rick Rolls.
'Cut your shower time by 3 minutes' But what about the people who shower FOR 3 minutes?
Wait if the reprev company pass 30 mill maybe mrbesat donated the plastic that got out of the ocean
if im going to rate you 2/10 tou talk to much but you do nothing
What is the world and I will 6
nic
Not dissing this guy... but didn't he spend like a few hours of recording about how plastic is bad... then promote a product packaged in said plastic?
💚💚💚💚❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yesterday in the shower i was thinking About making the shampoo bottle. BUT IT EXISTS!
Hello. Please I watched your screen protector review video yesterday, and I wanted to know where I could get the Charous Screen Protector to buy.
All of the studises about meat polution dont take in acount the fact that grass grows from the co2 made by cows , and grass DOES NOT GROW if it is taller than 30~50 cm.

Those transparent solar panels are gonna be the future of phone. You won’t need a charger. You won’t need wireless charging. You won’t need annoying solar panels. Charge by the day. Use by the night. Genius invention
This is now my favourite video of Arun channel
Meal worms….. that’s gonna backfire for sure! Imagine if they become a pest like termites and start eating all the plastic, even the stuff we need!?! 😂🤣
Love your content, love the way you present, live the Toga and love Milo ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Just use a big pasta as straw common, why do people need to look so far..?
It's not a mistake it's a masterpiece
Please help me to reach my target 😢😥😥
Algeeee 😂  Sorry im American...
has anyone ever told you that you look like Dr. Ramsey Rosso from the flash live action?
Old news..
Me hearing about algae being used to power buildings: oxygen not included has taught me how to do everything here.
I like how he talked 16 minutes about plastics and saving world and then promoting a fully plastic packed product
Nice videos thank you for all the work that you do
I love his videos
Be forgot to mention that the trees cut from the paper industry are farmed trees and the paper industry actually gives back a lot more trees than it takes. Granted it still uses harsh chemicals for processing the paper
Imagine Parchment Poo Paper.
Of course, Rick Astley on Poo Paper(I’m pooping as watching this video)
Arun : Talks about how plastic is dangerous Also Arun : *wears a plastic head band*
Talks about a plate that replaces plastic plates, the plates come in plastics packaging
Poo paper? More like Pooper
trees are bad, its time for TeamMoss and FlashMoss
Arun trying to climb the tree in THIS OUTFIT . Neighbors : 😐😑😐
I wonder if it would be practical to catch rain water falling on high rises/sky scrapers in wet climates that don't get enough sun for solar to fall that height into a turbine or line the down spout with piezoelectric flaps to generate power.
The line for me was the "m feeling wet just thinking about it" 🤫  6:47
"algy" 2:47
why isnt anyone talking about the rickroll :(
The soap one is a clever idea although I feel as though the entire thing being a block of soap would grant you more soap in the long run. Maybe if it was dishwashing liquid or something else, sure, but liquid soap inside soap seems kind of redundant 😂
One has to love cats, they are satanic or holly, no middle ground... Yours looks quite the former, rather than mine. :)
The timers on each number are a nice touch, as the bacon timer... Great content.
Most likely the shower head is electric... I see no real saving there.
THIS IS A NEW CLOUD!
The fact that he actually wore the clothes on the thumbnail... he's a real one
Pretty ink-credible   😂😂😂
9:52
That wheat plate took the "its so delicious you will eat the plate with it" to another level
Hey arun I love your vids so much I’ve been watching for about 3 months now and your awesome keep up the noice work
You forgot one godly invention "stone paper"
Going vegan is not viable. Sure, it is possible to live out of it, but you can never be healthy. Either you eat more food and lots of supplements, and therefore eat more calories and get fatter... Or you don't follow a strict high caloric diverse vegan diet, just a regular vegan, and have your health diminish...  Also, transformed vegan things are often very transformed.
Every new video is great because there is a new feature and better editing technique  Well Played
The vegan leather one is a bit funny, since it only makes sense if everyone is vegan and no cows are being eaten (and practically no sense at all if it isn't as strong/durable as actual leather).  Leather is a byproduct, so it's just making use of what's left of the animal that was eaten. If animals are still being eaten, but we're using take leather....that skin just goes to waste instead?
FANTASTIC idea that was shown off at CES, a shower that recycles the water, just make sure you turn off the feature if you're gonna have a piss 🤢😂😂
‘It’s still the tastiest plate I’ve ever had’ 😳😰
¡Gracias!
Save the world from these tech gaints scumbags.
Omg 😳 this video was awesome and stunning
Arun is by far the best most reliable youtuber in the whole industry very funny and informative and the best word would describe him is variety
Superdry are doing the 1st one, i know a lot of their clothes are 100% recycled
Okay but who came up with the idea “let’s burn elephant poop and see what happens”
2.5 gallon? Please, you're British. Use proper units.
Number 7 brings a whole new meaning to finish ur plate
I believe that name is pronounced Brite-en-hoo-ber.
7:24 never gonna give you up

no 18: a lot of moving parts,lots of connections that could fail, nice idea but in one year for sure lots of the generators will fail
Oh Jesus 🙂
how do they count the bottles?
I've been showering with Nebia for years and it's truly blissful! The only downside is that it's a bit noisier than other showers.
The biggest contributer to plastic is actualy the fishing industrie
I'm loving this video man, my hope for humanity is surprisingly raved with your voice 😂

Have you seen Desserto Pelle? Leather made from cactus in Mexico. It’s been tested by BMW and Aston Martin.
I wonder how many costumes he has
We share the exact same name
Having the Ecocapsule in the USA would actually be illegal, as it is illegal there to collect rain water, as rain water is owned by the state, making it not only theft to collect rain water, but you are actually stealing from the state which is kind of worse than stealing from a private person.
The plastic road is shit btw.. Its a massive source of microplastics. People, bikes and cars are abrasive. It just leaks microplastics unfortunately.
I’ve seen the wind trees in Switzerland
y dose your logo look like the motoroler one

Alright I know it's maybe a bit late, but does anyone know the name of the song at 7:42 ?
Hi arun
11:20 Sooooo... you buy a car you polute the air and now they make smt out of the polution and sell again.. so.. you basically just put money in they'r pokets twice
1:02  Those catches were too clean
His dress s kind of weird 🤣🤧
A few of these while the idea is good Please consider the fact that the production of them causes just as much if not more damage to the environment A better idea would be to donate to things like planting trees and reforestation and the bigger effect movements  Or reduce the use of plastics in fishing nets and glitter in the boating industry It's the difference between tens of things that make a fraction of a change to one single action that makes a major change You need both for things to work But the fastest route would be to solve the glaring issues before handling the smaller issues
It's just overacting brother.
where is the living buildiNG ??????????????????????????????
Angelic is already mine. Hehehe loved the vid bro!
Literal shit paper
all of these things dont solve 1 problem though…                cost.

I am suprised that he didn't buy any of those lol

Damn it Arun, stop showing ads on your video. I subscribed to Youtube Premium just to get rid of Youtube ads, but you just ruined it. 😫🤣
I wish every country accept these products to save earth❤
Plastic clothes isn't good for environmental  Every time you wash them they leave behind micro Plastic not visible to naked eyes
the problem with plastic road is that when cars go over them they slightly erode the road and they create micro plastics that are equally if not even worse.
Rick and rolled
Hmm Why don't you put fibre optic cables over solar panels that causes it to trap more light than the original version
was watching lost in space and Ignacio Serricchio , reminded me of you. Both look very alike

There are two type of people in this world 1.Innovate to save the planet 2.Mfers making NFT's to save their own ass.
Thank you so much. This actually did give me a little bit of hope.

Now I’m just waiting for tech to help repair and regenerate teeth.
6:00 who the hell takes a 25 minute long shower?
Imagine going in public eating a literal plate and the people around you are like: wut is tat guy doin
Hey can you look at a Samsung galaxy AO1
Greta thunberg would be proud ! 🔥
Wait big brain idea why don’t we found out a way to launch trash at the sun and burn it
This must be his comic-con costume….must be going as Tech-God
Can you review vivo y69 screen not breaking pls
#4 no, fuck no, just fuck no there is so much wrong
“I’m feeling wet just thinking about it” AYO WTF
Great video. Plz also do a vid about technology with responsibly collected resources without child labor, forced labor, etc. sometime in the future. I'd love to see that
Number one should be nuclear energy and the solution of how nuclear waste can be decayed into stored energy until it turns to lead. Screw solar and wind energy, it's a scam!
the fuck is a euro?
Lets get Arun to 10m subs!
i didnt even notice the bacon meter
why does he look like dhann mann
Why shouldn’t I shift to veganism  Mrwhosetheboss:BACON me: health
You  create amazing videos so fast. They aren't short or clickbait and you upload like 4 times a month. You are amazing.
When more start doing research (instead of just trusting "experts" and big government) we'll see that most plastics made can't even be recycled. Sooo...
Bag = plastic,
He’s does not have a suit on!! XD
Can we have more of these hope videos? That would be very nicd
the jacket in the beginning kinda looks like the premier league ball
I can't play my favorite game
Arun is like the only YouTuber I watch anymore because his reviews are actually good, his opinion is something I actually want to hear because of his interesting personality, and he cares about about the world and has good humor and even the repetitive long running jokes on his channel that are sneaked into every video are actually funny.
You made my day man ❤️❤️
Take a guess, think this guy will hit 10m subs around 17 Feb
The thing with plastic roads is that roads are constantly being eroded. This issue doesn't really matter with concrete or asphalt but with plastic roads it means they generate tons of micro plastic particles.
Are you british
Just gonna say veganism has ups and downs. I'd you are vegan. Cool. If not still cool.
Are you British?
What if you use a massage gun on the tiles that give energy
The best one was 17:34
I couldnt imagine constantly feeling like a burden, i fell sorry for people like that
You should had said that's Facon amazing 10:47.
6:13 If your room is 8 cubic feet, yes. Lol.
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16 KJV, Jesus Christ is the only way.
I can't believe a 16 minute video would restore my faith in humanity
With the last one, wouldn't it be impossible to have any WiFi or radio in buildings with that technology or is it for a higher frequency, but the infrared wouldn't work.
The wind generater tree is a steaming pile of BS. There is no way one of these trees can generate more than 10 Watts
A 25 minute shower?! Jesus Christ, Aaron you absolute madman.
The power bank Does Not charge itself. The wind charges it through a turbine. And carrying a turbine around sure seems like a good idea 🙄
🤣🤣🤣Bright idea🤣🤣🤣
Thanks!
I found something that already saved the world.  JESUS
Is 19 mushrooms box edible
HOW DARE THEESE DEMONEDS MAKE VEGAN BACON
Nothing is godly but god
There are some of these that I really like even if I'm not a super environmental person, converting the floor into generating electricity by walking is a genius idea
pls do 80 s tech that would be awsome
YES my brother.. who is not up for SAVING THE WORLD... haha
4:09 "thats what" lol
Bottles made from soap... great... good luck using that when you're in the shower with wet hands. Also, I once had an atomizing showerhead. Trust me, they suck. The thing didn't last half a year before I had to throw it out because it has very fine holes. Unless you shower with distilled water, they will clog up with limescale very quickly. The edible plates, might work for camping. I can't remember ever seeing single-use plates here, even for camping we use reuseable plastic dishes. Hope these edible ones are reuseable, too. If you go camping for a week or two, you'd go through a lot of plates otherwise. Transparent solar panels are interesting. There's also printable solar panels. Dunno if that really works, but it would be rather interesting, too. Cheaply available solar panels.
me hearing : you will restore your feaith in humanity Me laughts. GOOD. LUCK
hi sir my name aqib im from pakistan your are donig great work love you bro
bro number 18 theres been one like right next to where I live for the past like 6 years
Can't stand how he says Algae
I'll use anything on this list gladly.        But I'm never using that elephant shit paper no matter how much money you give me.
Mrwhosetheboss, listen, vegan meat and vegan leather wont help. Theres billions of people and millions and millions of slaughteries all around the world. People who kill animals dont do math "oh theres ( ) much people that are vegan and ( ) much people that eat meat. That means I have to kill ( ) much cows." People dont do that. People just kill. So becoming vegan is even worse, because more and more people are becoming vegan which means more and more meat goes to WASTE. If everyone suddenly became vegan it would help. But that's just a dream.
Hello man you many times better than marques brownie plz make vedeo any content atleast upload shorts plz '1 crore subscriber" is too close
Srilanka in mrwhosetheboss video 🇱🇰 ❤️
Thanks arun for raising the environmental awareness this makes me happy to see
11:46, no stop pushing the idea that the planet can be saved by not eating meat, it is very misleading and stupid, deluding people into the wrong idea, the same people that take that path probably drive teslas thinking that is saving the planet as well.
13:42 lol
Is it just me who see the that’s was she said jokes in his video?
14:10 if you want to plant more trees than can your local forest have, its worse than cutting them down.
Anyone got the sauce on that biohybrid building
Rickrolled by poo paper
wow!!
I like your videos..... one thing I would say is that the titles are a little bit clickbaity
1:12  Nope..you did not pronounce that correctly-      (I am german so ye-)
Becoming a type 1 civilization isn’t far away
We have the tools to save the world, but we need people and mainly corporations to stop being ignorant
7:11 look at the paper
Would love you to make a video to argue why Samsung should make a ultra with a 7000mh battery. Go into detail with battery size and how much thickness it add.  I personally would love a full 2 day battery at least.
6:48   I'm feeling wet just by thinking about it   "That's what she said"
I don’t get how vegan bacon beat out the mushroom packaging

I keep finding your 4 year old videos and watching them I can see how much improvement u have done. Geed job Arun!
I thought you were gonna say Ecosia, its a search engine that helps plant trees :)
Roman empire was evil dude. Let's not relive history. Set your focus on God in heaven.
bro, you're the best youtuber I've watched in my life, but there is aproblem that I have. i watch you from germany and I'm the best in class in english but bro! you're speaking tooooooo fast so i can't understand only 60% of that what you say in the videos. PLS can you speak a little bit slower that will be "angellic" XD
man man man....he drew on normal paper while  he had POO PAPER 11:20
I feel like he is simplifying too much complex subjects, like solving the plastic problem within months. For every type of plastic.
vegan food  - more packaging - more processing. New equipment. Its a disaster !
Did he just rickrolled everyone with poo paper?
This must be the worst video you've made. 99% more crap stuff to take care of a non problem. Little plastic propellers in a fake tree? c'mon man. Where did the reflecting wise man go? Are you his bodysnatcher!? Nowhere in the western world is plastic being dumped in rivers and oceans or landfills. We burn it and clean the exhaust, just like trucks and cars do with carbon fuels. Basically all that is left is plant food.. CO2 tada. Facon is the only real winner.
Plastic roads was in the Netherlands
just got rick rolled by poo paper
Hi sir I don't know english because I am from Bihar but by your to make your subscribers happy. Makes me really motivated to watch your videos even though I don't know english , hats off bro
THAT MEAN WHEN I EAT STEAK I AM PUTTING HOULS IN THE OZONE LAYER
POO PAPER OH NO I USED TO EAT PAPER I HOPE I DINT EAT THOSE
VEGE BACON BRUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
BRUH ALL YOU GET IS PAPER STAWS
That out of focus plant placed on the table bothers me a lot.

Really great video but I don't understand the point of throwing food arround 5:45.
Rickroll this guy, and he will enjoy it, and maybe even pay you for it. It is truth. 😁
Aron's outfit's just killin it. Just saying.:))
Limited edition phone unboxing
Me noticing most of the inventions here are vegan also me off to buy a few cows for future use. I need meat no two ways about it 😂
Nice video arun
Female Arun enjoying barbeque
This is the future
"I'm feeling wet just thinking about it" Take this out of context as you like.
I love Arun from PASSIONFRUIT
I Love the Wind Tree but it is soooo sooooo soooo expensive!!! 😭
Not gonna give up the bacon for that facon but that Vegan leather got me intrigued now Nike needs to pair that with the recyclable plastic and give me a signature sneaker… We can even call it the Waste Force 1…
First
The things is with degradability is frowned upon by most people because how inconvenience it is
i love how he always  manage to rickroll us
Bruh....you are AMAZING!
i olny shower for 1 minute ;-;
really great! looking forward to the future then :>
Regarding the vegan leather, a lot of cultures has already been using pineapple fibers for centuries. It doesn't make sense why do you need to turn it into another version of synthetic leather.
“Imagine 10000 glasses of water in the room right now, it will literally fill op every inch of the space”    Me in the auditorium: “Nice try”
May the world not see this inventions as an excuse and spread pollution as usual. We really need more of this great innovators 👍
I think the shower-water description might unintentionally make people imagine it's more epic than it is. It would fill 2 average bathtubs to the brim, so bathing sure uses less. But a 3X4m space would fill under an inch with that water. Not quite space-filling.
I think the .... paper product (ehem) could use a much better name xD Nuff said eh?
You should make a video on NFTs.
You catch things like a Boss. Show us all the fails ;)
I really like the transparent solar panels which can be used ti change every single piece of glass we use normally
8:29 that girl looks familiar😁
My bro looks like street jesus.
Actually, poly-lactic acid straws are widely available nowadays. They are just the same as plastic straws whilst at the same time decomposable.
does anyone notice in the poo paper part the paper with he is holding has Rick Astley on it
pause at 13:38
Hey Arun! I have a little video idea for youuu. "If smartphones could utilize 100% of their hardware specs, how would they be like?"
each one of this stuf starting at 2 million
Did he really  say he showers 25 mins straight ? Like wtf never heard someone shower that long, am I the only one wondering ?
13:50 to 13:55 I was thinking of genocide but whatever
This channel is so good. Unlike other so called tech channels, Arun showcase everything related to technology, inventions, and leaps in all spectrums including, ofcourse, gadgets. Keep growing Arun. Also, try wearing a spartan outfit next time if you can, you'll look amazing.
Amazing episode
What about envirochip is it legit or a scam?
the real question is if we will have enough time (and sanity) to implement this stuff.
who the hell takes a 25 minute shower  3-5 minutes done .
Damn ur unique bro 😎
Me after 20 seconds of video, Wait wait wait let me sit properly and bring some popcorn
7:30 RickRoll'd
Any one know how to edit that left circle things
Could you please send me the I phone that you have done experiment with that phone if it is okk then I could use this to make YouTube vedio for my channel 😔😔😔😔
little correction to the end of your video, 19 toxic not 21  17:23
Bro I'd be in my garden swing a turbine
"I'm feeling wet just thinking about it." .. LMAO 🤣
Arecnaut plates though not edible are a fraction of the price at which the wheat plates are being sold and have been around for a long time now.
as you said it is restoring faith in humanity👏
We got Rick rolled
Vibranium floor😂 really interesting
We all know that design in the paper is a rickroll
Woah, glad to see my hometown there Arun. 5:38 That’s the Mount Matutum in Polomolok, Philippines
be honest, who else forgot he was cooking the facon
give me your skincare routine
A powerbank that self recharge oh i want ittt
Pinatex from the Philippines for the win!
Invisible light? You meam 4 and 5G too?
Did my guy just use a metal spatula on his non-stick!?
The "that's what she said" jokes make the video so much better
7:10 talk about getting Rick rolled by a piece of paper
If people waste so much water in shower then use a freaking bucket , you don't need a new invention for that
Nice vid
But 90-93% of plastic waste on oceans comes from 7 rivers. And around 90% of that river waste is from Chinese factory rivers. Why are we doing all of this? Just to reduce that 5% while China does whatever the fuck they want?
Can you review the oppo find x5 when it comes out
He rickrolled us
UNPOPULAR OPINION: The Earth created humans to create plastic. Humans seem think think life is about them,,,and its not.
God, humans can be so amazing.
The background music ahhhh
If you want to read the Gospel, then I will put something like that in my replies, but if you read that then you should still read the complete Gospel. If you read it then like the comment so that more people can see it, and more people have at least one opportunity, because accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior is the most important decision that you will ever make.
u r also looking like a priest 😂😂😂
Self sufficient building… ingenious
Mealworms that can solve all the world's plastic problems  Arun: 9/10
With the straw thing, I got myself and a few friends and family sets of stainless steel straws that we all use when going out.  With the fake bacon I have a funny thought, there are only so many tast chemicals that we detect when eating (it's why snake, crocodile, alligator and chicken tast so similar) so if you get the right mix of chemicals for the taste and the protein/nutrients then you are eating animal meat. Just used a different way to get it due to them being the same. Now you dont have to use an animal to get it  but there would be no difference.  On a side not, why do so many vegans that go to a subway ask for normal cheese and not  vegan cheese, like are you vegan or not. Flip, they have a go at people for being non vegan. So confusing....(the having a go part is just for the annoying vegans not all).
I have reusable straws but they are created with some type of metal
Hooray! He is wearing a Team Seas hoodie at the end.
Bamboo straws
Here in the Philippines we actually use pineapple leaves to make our traditional long sleeve clothing called "barong tagalog"
13:32 and my lizard eats it, alot, does that mean he can eat plastic now?🦎
no god except the god
the mealworm idea should be 10/10
Great job!would you write back on a job opportunity? just curious.
Be careful when you see an anti-bacterial label on a plastic. There are chemicals used in plastic manufacturing that are also antibacterial agents. Many unethical companies use that fact to claim that the plastic is antibacterial because trace amounts of the agent are present. However, that doesn't mean that the product has effective and lasting anti-bacterial properties that would matter to you and me. It's like claiming that the plastic water bottle you put rot-gut vodka in is alcoholic because you can't ever get rid of the faint smell of engine degreaser.
Mushroom packaging should get a better rating imo
Yep, that was some straight-up crock of shite. These items ranged from vapourware, BS and full on scam. For example, what I am calling the Full-BS-Tree-Drone. 20K trees, planted per drone, per day. In order for success, most trees are planted as a seedling or sapling, (require planting at a specified depths and spacing), not just spreading seed like you are "feeding the Chickens" wink-wink. Basically this is not remotely possible. However, even if we entertain the thought that this is possible (which it is not), you would need a whole s-tonne fleet of Full-BS-Tree-Drones to make those numbers. Have fun with that.
Pavegen reminds me of the micro verse Rick and Morty episode
road to 10 million subs!
8:28, is that you as a girl?!?! 🤣🤣🤣
Moss beds are also under estimated for oxygen production.
Why not use plates made out of leaves, like Indians do
Pays extra for fast shipping, uses vids as an excuse to buy random stuff XD
Cool video... stupid outfit
Transparent solar panels is literally what my bachelor thesis was about which I just finished last month. Seeing it on number 1 got me really excited.
Congrats on soon reaching 10M! It's been brilliant watching you grow!
Seriously….what is he wearing 😂😂
Finally my dream of eating plates and bowls can Finally become reality
"thanks to nebia you can buy a shower head that atomizes water"  hmmmmm let me think about this  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
I am sorry but I have to point this out … but the wheat bran plates are an application that not only addresses nothing but also decidedly not environmentally friendly. To get wheat bran from wheat crop requires about 50 - 90 kilo watt hours per tonne of electricity. Then add the energy now being spent on the up stream and down stream supply chain to and from the plate manufacturing and add the energy used in the end to end manufacturing process. All for what ? Having the pleasure of retasting my lunch ?
Imagine if he made a phone thst would be mindblowing
I hope u stop swearing & making religious jokes & verses..etc  U r my favourite youtuber  But his ruins it ...
These videos are a waste!!!!! 😡😡😡
Please turn up the music next time 😐
Out of all of these the Nebia Moen is more of a tech fail than anything. I've had one and ita pressure was awful and due to it misting you couldn't really get hot water.
Great video and great ideas but the foldable straw is 0/10 bullshit. No one will ever use this thing
Pls go back to Android
No.2 is the best.
yeah, but the wind tree system is still made out of plastic
5:10 bro it’s a bacon-o-meter that’s pure GENIUS
It was at this moment that he knew.... 7:54
Any info on how much water gets contaminated to turn the trash into clothes?
So the cost of those 20,000 trees is 10,000 dollars, 10k a day. Yikes
16:20 Cat is sus
Is it possible to do a video on upcoming phones? Things to look forward to or at least focus on
Please mrwhosetheboss for a phone please  . thank you
Zeus must be proud of you
That bbq wont work for me where i live it is almos always cloudy
I love your dress excellent choice for the title and you were smart in it
Who else is waiting and trying to predict what the Subscribe pun will be in the video?
Interesting video. Very nice
the sequel to this video: 21 satanic inventions to bring the world to PIECES
Huel tastes like 💩
The gosun is cool and all that metal takes a lot to manufacture and causes alot of pollution so it’s not really as good. Which disappoints me
Hemp would help solve a lot of these issues as well
Eat your vegetablessssss
Dude your the best, your videos showing inventions. Breaking down things in a simple way for anyone to understand. Has made me fall in love with Technology, keep making great videos.
Pls can u gave me one of your 5G phone pretty pls
Day 1 of asking: Can you do another more in depth review of mous cover?
Sometimes I just don't want to watch the video because of horrible click baits
This takes “finish your plate” to a whole new level.
Too bad I can't send you pictures, I would show you how to eat in Harghita county in Romania, "goulash in bread",🙃😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i dont eat bacon
In a way I'm marveled at the capacity of our species to make such things. On the other, I know that most of these will be relegated to the "really nice but not really sustainable economic adventures". It would be extremely informative, if a bit dull for your audience, if you could provide the financial performance of these companies in the last 3 years or so. I'd wager that most of them (70% or more) are operating at a loss with no trends of it ever turning to profit territory.
Thanks to u & 2 ur team, kudos
THAT WASNT MILK
I really thought this guy was dar mann
A very responsible youtuber
I have benn watching this channel since it had 2.4 million subscribers...its funny that after all this years of awesome content I'm still not a subscriber...what the hell is wrong with me😅😅😅
Man, you just restored my faith in humanity. Thank you! ❤️
Are we all gonna ignore his catching skills?
Boss it's  time for time stamps, don't you think?
6/10  a portable turbine? dude... portable solar panels have been around for ages
Arun : am feeling wet by jst thinking of this😏 😬👀 Double meaning
this poo paper really disturbs me
btw i saw a hidden that what
At 9:05 whose that in the middle😂
Mr who set the boss
Are you a muslim, Please tell us in your next video, I am not asking because I am against muslims but because I am a muslim myself.
Waiting for 10M SUB 🖤
Where do you get your chair?
Mrwhosethegod
7:10
OK. Wait. I don't get it. Why so much thing about the bath and using water? The water isn't going into the void, it's still in the earth.  We kinda waste water by drinking it as we change its chemical formula.  Bat anyway
How you make us attentive and interested for the entire length of your video must be considered a SUPER POWER!!!... You are INKcredible... 😉
that’s what?
I really like your videos, but this one is not right. All the gadgets and things you literally promote are good products. But you make it sound like these thing are solutions. The best thing is to try to live simpler. Just don't shower for 25 minutes, or don't use straws. I am not being hateful but wanted to say it 👍👍
Mr whose my u please have an iPhone 13 mini
10x10x10 glasses of water wouldnt fill my room
striking resemblance to the veal thing?
It's cool and all but i'm disappointed that you didn't include MR BEAST TEAM TREES AND TEAM SEAS.....
While enjoying the form, let's be clear: At least half of those things are "green-scam" and actually making things worse, than it is without them…   I mean ink made out of pollution would require hell a lot of energy to make it and then cleanse all highly toxic things from it… …so possibly creating more pollution, than what was drained out into the ink…  Also that grill looks actually great, but how do you clean that thing…?  So only thing, that is undisputable, is that edible plate, which may be also energy-costly to make, but it is less costly, than trying to collect plastic plates around…
Get To 10 Mills Of Subs So I Would Be Amazed ^_-
I love how on the bran plates its wraped in plastic
7:26, no... just no.
Hi arun
Crazy we can come up with ideas like these but can't figure out how to solve our homeless crisis
DAMN!!! Arun's videos define quality! I finally found out whosetheboss
Solar panel windows are a really good idea, if they can commercialize it and it doesn't just turn into vaporware. I bet a lot of people like myself would love windows that block some of the visible light from coming in so it isn't as eye searingly bright and doesn't heat up our homes as much in the summer, which means the solar panels could block maybe 30% or even more of the visible light and turn that into electricity too, while the perceived light coming through would still be bright enough.
Wonder how dead you'd be if you were a kid, your parents gave you a pen made from pollution and you ate it. God knows what's in that thing.
This video slightly helped restore my faith in humanity. There's no way that fake bacon is as good as you made it sound though. No meat substitutes have the same satisfaction as real meat, they just can't copy it closely enough, and they haven't yet come up with a convincing meat flavoring. It's easy to add smoke flavor but bacon is not just smoke flavor. Bacon is the hardest one because it has such a distinct flavor, every fake bacon product I've ever seen has been mediocre. Might be tasty in their own right, but bacon they are not.
Please do more of these sustainable tech videos Arun! Future generations will thank you <3
If everything is turned into a solar panel then how will we get power in the night time. I don't think we can store electricity yet or we can and I'm just dumb
JESUS
happy to be a student of biotechnology
always finds a way to rickroll us
Unless you are a member of a Judao Christian faith I’m deeply offended that you mock those faiths with your outfit what someone wore a turban or put on extra hands to be lord Krishna incredibly rude
Sir,Really i love u
The thing i like about this guy is how he explains things with plain simple sentences and says it like a pro and then the fact his sense of humour just makes it even better
Most of these projects are actually really interesting and cool and could probably work, but plastic road has been tried 3 times already afaicr, 2 times it was a scam and the other time it wasnt a scam but it still failed.
can you dip your smartphone and iphone in alcohol!!!!!
I watched this just to see what shower head you picked and There was this Kickstarter once called Mission8 that you should check into. Also, that portable wind turbine🤩impressive but there is another one (I can’t recall the name but) it has 2 possible charging methods 1)Wind but also 2)Hydro🤔 So, if someone is in the woods or somewhere with a current, they can attach it   With a line to ancore the devise and then place it in the flowing current if there is no wind ✌🏼🖖🏽
most of these sound highly impractical and the house sounds and looks like a smart trailer
His outfit was 10/10
HaHa, The eatable plates were wrapped with plastic And Arun wore yellow plastic on his head in the video
That was in glasses won’t fill up the room I’m in I’m in my school cafeteria
Can you please talk about xiaomi 11 ultra and xiaomi 12 pro
Nike is also recycling 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Hey um maybe try unbox the Realme narzo 50a pls!
7:23 yuck would never use $hitty paper.
How did you get the mushroom based packaging you used in the video? Can you just buy them, or did you have to buy a product that used it? Just out of curiosity.
You really just Rick rolled us back there
"AL-GI"... can't get it out of my mind
Heavenly?godly? Don't he know that this words insult religions I hope influencers think before writing hateful speech
10:09 did those ecofriendly plates just come in plastic wrap?  lol
You look like God in this dress 😄.  Thanks God for this informative video.
Hello brother, I have a problem with my smartphone OnePlus 9 pro The problem is in the upper area of ​​the screen in some applications and games that do not work, please help me 🤕🤕🤕
Do a video where you buy tons of drones and rate them
"Am feeling wet just thinking about it"- thats what she said😂😂
So we can stack the transparent solar cells one above the other to produce more energy from same amount of light?
Is one of your best videos yet I really found some hope in humanity of their watching this video
Love it
Pov that vegan teacher watching : yes yes this the channel i have been looking for revolution is coming
Can you please do a review of the S21 FE
Solar panels on rooftops? In the Netherlands it’s mostly farmland thats been used for solarparks.
Is the HUEL plastic bag and bottle recyclable ? Because thats the main idea of the video and if you get sponosred by something that goes against the whole topic , whats the use ? No hate btw :D
10:10  South Indians are using such eco friendly plates (Banana leaves) from thousands of years, and you guys came to know about it now.
Only an idiot would rate 2 for 10 of a plastic recycling clothing company.
the puns were straight to the heaven
Those low reviews are kinda disrespectful, yea i mean obv  there's mor productsthat are more helpful but imagine inventing a product thinking that its your life greatest work just to someone rate it 2/10 lol
Bruh god created animals to eat not to save
Plastic is biodegradable it just takes longer don't kid yourself
Where I can buy zstraw?
Love your videos! 😍 (However I'm unsure how a folding straw is better than a living building? 🤔)
I'm starting a petition to have Arun do ALL his videos in this beautiful ancient Greek tunic 😁
I live in Costa Rica, we produce 1/3 of all pineapple in the world. As the vegan leather is a nice idea i can guarantee that is not safe for the environment.  The production of pineapple is unsafe for anyone around it, even the water gets highly contaminated by Bromacil. Since i knew that i stopped eating it for good.  I mention it cause the extension of the production of that is gigantic, they produce it even in protected areas illegally.  Re-using materials is not safe for the environment. The process of making something needs the same energy and resources (including water, gas and oil) as any other thing. Making a cool hoodie with plastic bottes but they have to assemble/manufacture in Asia will not change anything.  Those are cool things but we have a lot to learn, we need to separate the mass production of a green label to the idea someone had in mind as a real contribution for the environment.
This video seems.... *HEAVENLY*
Best advertising i ever watched
7:35 YOU GOT ME NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
7:53 I heard Shaun's voice from the series "The Good Doctor"
Hey what's your real name??????
Plz review soundcore life q30 plz
Talking about stocks, Forex and cryptocurrency trading is the profitable venture I have ever invested in I reached my goal of $120k monthly trade earnings. wondering if viewers here are familiar with  Claudia Walter's trading strategy...??
A TWENTY-FIVE MINUTE SHOWER?! The part of me who grew up during a drought weeps. Forget the fancy showerhead, get yourself a normal water-saving shower head and take showers of no longer than ten minutes. Yikes.
if mrwhosetheboss makes a commercial, i will 100% buy that phone
The boss is here.. Thanks sir for the great informative video
Glad this is in my recommendation. Very Informative
Now I understood name of your channel. 😸
6:22 they have taps like that in South Africa because the government is trying conserve water because they're in a water crisis. Although it helps, they suck and are so annoying to use!
What if those worms mutate just like gulf bacteria to eat oil has mutated and started harming people on beaches
This Huel is Sathumaavu kanji boss 😂
faith in humanity still not there you have failed me once again
You as Jesus... 🤣🤣🤣
Let's save the world by using this guys
14:01 Tree Planting Drones was best use of technology & especially helpful in war torn countries of African Continent where either the people had migrated or died in the civil wars .Where there is a huge opportunity for massive global tree planting and keep a track on the amount of corruption with the help of these data collected by these drones, but in developing countries it will increase the unemployment.
Disgusting costume unfollowing you for  same be normal mr boss dont be a joker
the problem why most of this are not really into the market because there are always someone who control market share. For example the solar panel. If most of the house can produce electricity then the price will drop and the person who have a market share will lose their money. Thats why they always on top and rich while us become poor and poor
Imagine a plastic straw auctioning off for a million dollars a hundred years later
Capsule Corp house
Can I have one of your phones
BRO Recently MY FRIENDS PURCHASED ( ONEPLUS 7PRO ) AND ANOTHER ONE IS ( REALME X7 MAX 5G ) SO CAN YOU PLS SUGGEST ME WHICH 🤔SMARTPHONE SHOULD I BUY TO BEAT THEM
I think you're Mr beast
you are amazing. I allways smile when i watch your videos. your rick roll methods are amazing. everything about your editing to your jokes and memes. u just.. make me feel so happy inside. this is why you are my favorite youtube. thank you so much for all your hard work.
Is that how I'm supposed to say algea
the best part about his videos is every day i get to learn a new adjective he used before subscribe
So, I cant use #7 bc a have a grain allergy (so does my family)
How dare you compare this with god fear God in yourself  (وَٱتَّقُوا۟ یَوۡمࣰا تُرۡجَعُونَ فِیهِ إِلَى ٱللَّهِۖ ثُمَّ تُوَفَّىٰ كُلُّ نَفۡسࣲ مَّا كَسَبَتۡ وَهُمۡ لَا یُظۡلَمُونَ) [Surah Al-Baqarah 281]  It means  Beware of a Day when you will be returned to God: every soul will be paid in full for what it has earned, and no one will be wronged.  (فَذَرۡهُمۡ یَخُوضُوا۟ وَیَلۡعَبُوا۟ حَتَّىٰ یُلَـٰقُوا۟ یَوۡمَهُمُ ٱلَّذِی یُوعَدُونَ) [سورة الزخرف ٨٣ ] It means Leave them to wade in deeper and play about, until they face the Day they have been promised.
I love how he makes jokes about everything.
His dress looks like caesars
Close to 10M 😍😍
We are having watch party in our online class
If you still give away could you maybe get me a iPhone XR I subscribe
Plastic roads is stupid!!! Aaron definitely has no clue about civil.
use bucket and mug for bathing it saves a lot of water(only 30 -50 liters) 8 to 10 gallon
The last one madeglass make brrrrr
The eco capsule looks a lot like piccolos house
This is probably the single greatest video you have ever produced. The premise is amazing and it's so worth while for every person on the planet
I want to be Vegan to KILL plants
Nice costume 🤠
Arun, I love coming home from school and watching your videos. I love how detailed and fair you are in your tech reviews! Your not biased at all and I love it!
Oh no no no we should NOT COMPLETELY ABANDON MEAT MEAT IS IMPORTANT it has alot of nutrients we need
Can u give 5,000 in gcash pleaae i need money for school and i need a phone cause i have  no phone😥
Please who can recommend me to a professional trader ?
Great video
6:47 AYO??
"I'm feeling wet just thinking about it"  SIR
11:55 sounds a lot like "Solar freakin' roadways"
Mrwhosetheboss .aka. Arun .aka. Creator of WE .aka. King of technology .aka. GOD OF PUNS
His neighbous spying on him and seeing him in that dress: 😶😶😶
Future bio war: mealworms unleashed on plastic roads
the problem with plastic roads on some countries it gets so hot even asphalt melts
the vegan teacher after seing the facon and vegan leather:😊👏
I usually like your videos. But in this video, I think there are too many mistakes around plastic and pollution. Microplastics and nano-particles are completely ignored in your evaluation. I still gave you a thumbs up. But can you and your team, maybe with the help of other YouTubers, do some research about microplastics and nano-particles? Would be great if that topic could be taken into account henceforth when trying to evaluate the sustainability of ideas.
nice poo paper rickroll
I'm literally crying I want all of these to be mainstream This is what we need to do
people really need to invest in these!
Soooo ummmm there's some problems with your video.  1 Veganism is not actually taking off fast. In fact masny vegan foods like Beyond burgers or impossible burgers do not sell. (Vegan meat) doesn't sell either. Grocery stores dont make money on them. 2 Alge lights have been around for years. When I was a kid I saw one in someones home, It was beautiful. Because of the kind of alge, they even glowed. Only problem is the alge doesn't survive long.  3. (Vegan Leather) is not new, it dates back well over several hundred years. It was technically used though out the 1900s in other countries.
7:16 This has been done before in Sri Lanka                     Imagine you accidentally ate a piece of that paper 😳
How many of you saw his team seas hoddie.
His transitions are, ANGELIC
Let me put this back in my cloud storage🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You put a straw above I fricking living building
Great Video Arun. You just introduced me to so much useful and nice stuff, that's incredible.
mrwhostheboss: explaining plate while bacon is burning
Why do you look like you're wearing the Roman senate Toga
11:20 but did you sniff it to pass the sniff test
16:20 that's what sh-
Nice Pls do more of these types of vids
Imagine recovering 30 billion plastic bottles only to be beaten in rating by a foldable straw
Vegan leather=fake leather
nebia
Why don't we just stick solar panels on the sun? Perminant source of energy. I approve.
no need for that fancy shower head when you can just use a pail and a dipper.
No I will never put vegan bacon in my mouth and I’ll never become vegan
The poo paper he was holding had Rick astley on the back lol 😂
I think that "PINATEX" is from the philippines because of Dole company heheeheh and its proud to see that the idea of the Filipinos has became international❤️
How can i talk to u
Rick roll on poo paper
Anyone else here about the tree planting drones from mark river and mr beast
Number 4: NOPE, it just contributes to even more microplastics in the atmosphear ...
Mrwhostheboss it’s too late regarding what we do to stop climate change (or nuked because of a Sh!t head) our world is infected with too much stupidity to put an end to climate change (or curing stupidity)
I thought it was funny that no one thing ever reached 10/10 XD  even though i know the numbers dont matter~
Huel would kill me :(
sad i want to try huel, but got no money and i think its not available in my country
Hi, i am electrician mafia. I don’t like your video 🤣
Ya
So it takes$10,000 a day to plant 20,000 trees that's expensive
ZStraw is actually a pretty dumb idea.  There's straws made of sugarcane fibres that are biodegradable and don't have the issues that paper "fibre" straws have. And they're cheap too! They're very similar to plastic straws even in texture and usability, including by disabled people who can't drink with metal or paper straws.
plastic roads is 0/10. it will wear down and introduce micro plastic. unless you want to breathe micro plastic.
HO what you did [I promise it’s. Not mine )
Thought in this costume...hes here for next giveaway...
7:15 is a rickroll 😺
90% of this is stupid garbage that will be worse for the environment
Don’t bring heaven into this and Don’t mock The Lord Jesus Christ Our True God and our True King Amen (Aw-mane)
Can I ask the question everyone NEEDS to be asking?!! WHY DO WE EVEN NEED STRAWS 😂😂🙌🏽 seriously! So many great ideas but we could just forgo them altogether, right? Maybe some disabled & children might need one… hmm 🤔 I feel like anyone who medically needs a straw would not really be the person to carry a straw like this 😬
10:13 there is a downside if your are gluten free, which I know plenty of people that are.
Algy
End predatory capitalism to save the world
plastic roads? :D i think, Dave Jones already debunked it.
The real nr.1 ... STOP BUYING THINGS!!!
i JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR MRWHOSETHEBOSS TO SAY I WILL CATCH YOU IN THE NEXT ONE
Ah yes, mealworms are the greatest invention.
real bacon is way healthier than that chemical facon thing. all that fake taste must be synthetic.
7:10 I love how we get a rickroll almost every video, I also love the iconic "a sub to the channel would be _____"
Bruv i dont care about that stupid cow eating grass i want BEEEEEEEF
Air ink uses plastic for the marker, so they fixed one problem just to add to another
Well I dont think I want to suck on one straw for the rest of my life lol
thats what she said....4:08
We need more videos like this
It's not true that vegan foods emit less CO2, it's quite the opposite. In the US, only 2.7% af CO2 emissions are from animal agriculture, whereas 3.9% is from crops production. Also, it's not healthier to eat vegan foods. You'll be lacking high-quality protein, which you can only get from meat.
Number 7 is wrapped up in plastic
Great content as always
I feel we have so many options to change too but company’s don’t feel an incentive to do so as these options tend to cost more lowering a company’s profits
bro made a 17 second intro and then went to the point. amazing
Ecosia is another amazing thing that's a great way to combat climate change by doing LITERALLY nothing. Its a web browser that plants trees using the revenue generated from your searches. The data is also kept anonymous, so it doesn't add to your digital footprint (if I recall correctly).
While i love the idea of paper made of elephant shit, i would definitely not touch it at all
Vegan. Food no no vegan food no never
i can understand why some go vegan (others not so much) but i dont plan on going vegan, nothing against most of them, but its a choice that everyone has to decide on, and i decide against it
THE HELL IS A GALON
I just realize, because bacon is harram for me so I can't eat it right.  BUT I CAN EAT FACONN!!! I'll be waiting for some of this to drop in my country!!! :D
Well theres also radioactive energy I mean most countries and companies dont use it since it *SOUNDS* dangerous  but as long as the tech is up to date and the radiation is well checked we have an incredibly powerful infinite energy source
Breitenhuber is pronounst like this  ei is pronounst like eye so breyeten and than h an the word uber
The Great Rice Experiment proves that water is Alive and has Memory
Neat videos. But STOP clapping your d-nm hands!
Man that poo paper is the shittiest invention made
That’s it I’m switching to a plate only diet
Holy crap, I remember years ago when I learned that pressure sensors use crystals that generate electricity by pressure thats applied to them and thought it would be crazy if we took that and added it to floors so the pressure of things on the floors created energy. And it's cool seeing that this was already done
Hi
" that's what she said "
2 things I would like to point out!  1 have you noticed how most of those paper straws come in their private plastic wrapper?  The leaves of pineapples can actually be used, to grow pineapples
Can't look at him anymore orange eye shadow.
why is 14 glowing the whole time?
You need to do some proper research before you start posting some of these products. Plastic Roads is a perfect example of something that has already been debunked some 4 years ago and it sounds great until you look into all the problems they will cause.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
When planting 20k trees a day 50cents is a shit ton. That's $10,000 a day and that's if they only have 1 of those drones.
Funny. I just subscribe and my name is Angel :v
5:30 it doesn't really save the animals, though it does solve a waste problem somewhere, it creates another waste problem through the slaughter of animals.  Imagine if the skin for mcdonalds cows was thrown out, it would be more tragic to not use what we can of the animal.  It's just like how we started discarding tallow decades ago, which is a tragedy in itself considering animal fat is much healthier than other fats widely consumed by a large margin.
Loved it but it's j not g pls you sead it like 10 times.
ft
All of these are genius  👏
It's Zeus in 4k!
ok so what i got from the thumbnail is a tree that grows green rockets and a shower that makes you gay, truly we've been saved
Divine and godly means the saem thing and divine should be better than glorious
Who had the IDEA of poo paper?
As you said, it all comes down to personal preferences, behaviours, better living conditions (physical, financial) for a lot of people and basically general lifestyle for a lot of these inventions. A lot of these can just not be implemented on a major scale. Also, we gotta atleast be careful while utilising our resources and not be wasteful.
He promotes the bacon a bit more than the plate for a bit lol
LOL 16:17
No cows are killed for leather production. Leather is a waste product of the beef industry. Most “vegan leathers” are actually polymers and plastic based fabric woven imitations leading to increases. In micro plastic pollution. Leather is bio degradable, durable, and restorable.
Plasticroads??! *Angry Thunderfoot noise*
this video really gives me hope
can u please please please please please please please please please please please please please review honor magic v ( foldable smartphone) its amazing but i wana see your review ❤️
Omg your outfits😂😂😂😂😂😂
WE GOTTA TELL MR BEAST ABOUT THIS
So funny i forgot to laugh
Nice garment, Jesus would be proud 👍
I'm all for being environmentally conscious but if these companies were really all about saving the environment then they should make these products more affordable to the average family
love how he talkes about the nature and climate but in the end just pull out a plastic bag
One of your best videos so far in my opinion, thanks!
14:37 Fun fact |                            |                           V                                If a drone can plant 20k trees a day 1 per 5 cents, thats 1000 dollars a day.  - Divide 1000$ by 24 hours, thats 41.67 $ per hour of work - Divide 41.67$ by 60 minutes and thats 69 cents per minute of work - NICE   EDIT : Typo
Just wanna say somting to number 11. Yes you need trees to make paper, so yes the more paper - use the more trees you have to cut down... but you also have to plant more trees in order to keep the produktion going... Just want to point out that paper isn't all bad. Nice video tho - keep up the good work 💪💪💯🔥🔥🔥
Imagone being allergic to mushrooms and xoami just absolutely assassinates you🤣
Seriously man, promoting the plastic roads scam? Dislike.
These kind of videos you didn't hit 10M in 2021
And here I thought god's gift to mankind was 2020.
😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
still gay.
Mrwhosetheboss *You forgot to mention your Huel sponsor only works in UK, wasting everyone's time who even cares to consider buying sponsored huel bag.*
Thank God for these technologies
Me : Concept : Reusable toilet paper
the picture you showed in number 16 at the start is in hamburg, germany in a part called Wilhelmsburg just besides a big swimming hall and it was built on an building exhebition in 2013. interesting, my mom told me about it but I forgot it
Mrwhotheboss ashamed of you a man of integrity.
R u hindu??
I dont need that shwoer head that atomises water. I have chalk deposits in my shower head that does just that. all good.
Best video
10:10 I like the concept of replacing paper plates that can be easily recycled with wheat plates, wrapped in plastic, packaged in a colored paper box. Another scam for eco-idiots.
huh
How about reviewing older gear which is still relevant today? Call it a special episode.
Bro I want to say you that I love u so much. 😍
I would like to see more videos like this - instead of depressive newspapers, those could bring up the happiness by whole levels... really nice, thanks for the work!
Good luck 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
You're always making my day better aaron
good video 👍
At this point, pretty much nothing can restore my faith in overall humanity  Except that bacon. Mabey…
These will be fun to put a cyberpunk campaign, thank you ( ╹▽╹ )
Being a vegetarian is too expensive
YouTube is getting really comfy with these 15 second unskippable ads…
Why he drink milk like it nut?
from heavenly to glorious to godly to what was it? self charging power bank? Wait till thermodynamics hears about this!  oh wow thats cool I have 1600 I put on my box truck rv conversion and have a video on it
I think he would fall in a lot of tech scams. Need some thunderfoot counseling.
I am asking for your help when you are done with those phones and you are no longer need them, I need one. Please
Why did you just use a differnt person head in 8:28? 😅
That elephant dung paper could’ve been named as “POOper”.
Make a 4 hour video and we'll smoke every second of it. Next skipped 10 secs
Best video
Thats cool!
JoAnna Breitenhuber, pronounce the A in Joanna and it' flawless
His voice somehow sounds like an AI lol
We should place the drones and mealworms everywhere lol
i really love these kind of inventions...BUT all these will not yield any result UNLESS it is made cheap & affordable to lower income group, which is the majority.
As far as #10, the shower head, I wonder how well that would deal with hard water.
Wouldn’t replacing all pavements also bad for the world? :(
I really like the kinetic tiles and they look pretty enough for me to actually place them in my house
There was no need to rate them, all were good.
Why would we not want to wear more microplastics?
That Twss really got me laughing 4:07
Plastic roads result in tons of microplastic, so it is not a good idea.
Just got rickrolled again
Paper straw is so gross I already like the foldable straw
Number 19 seems kind off gross  It’s probably all hygenic so it’s smart
Auron never forget to rick roll us 🤦 This time by poo paper
The clothing one is bullshit. All they are doing is turning big plastics into micro plastics which are in some cases much worse.
Who f-ing takes 25 minutes in a shower? Be more conscious
Let me tell you about an invention that already exists and could save the world. Surveillance systems on the ground and satellites(a ton of them right now). They could spot the arsonists that burn our forests every year and hide behind the narrative of climate change.   Imagine how much CO2 , we would  avoid emitting, if we would not let our forests burn, because of indifference. And let me tell you a "secret" ; nature does not wake up every morning with the thought " which forest or forests should I burn today".  The fact that we don't identify the culprits  right away using these means which do not simply exist , they are already redundant, or don't take dramatic measures to reforestation makes the citizens and the gonvernments of the world direct or indirect accomplices.   Then we buy and accept a new car, phone, dress, spoon , computer , shoes every few years or months , weeks sometimes. Does it matter said car , phone, or our insatiable appetite for consumption and the vulnerability of the financial system that can't survive without a mad consumerism?  But , you know what?  Nature does not care about our petty socioeconomic constructs. We consume like drunken weirdos, then we want our products to be environmentally friendly. How stupid is that?  Why should 10 billion cars be environmentally friendly when our needs for transportation can be met with about 200 million vehicles of mass public transportation? Which is the lie we all consciously or subconsciously say to ourselves and others? Simply that our financial models will collapse if we do this. Let me tell you another secret . Financial models have been created historically to meet new social and technological realities. Seeing them as religion and their doubting as heresy does not help anyone.  We live in a new social and technological reality and we need a new model. I would go one step further to say , we need a new model that will take into consideration nature's virtues and vices.
You forgot most important one, vaccines. They allow every single human being to continue living on this world.
I'd take paper straws over those foldable plastic ones any day.
But transparent solar in Uk tho😂
4:09 I love his "that's what she said" jokes lmao
did Arun just waste the change to say "if you feel like shining then a sub to the channel would be.... brilliant...."?
How about doing a detailed video on Metaverse it will be..... Knowledgeable😂😂
Can we talk about how good he looks in a toga?
So I use 112.5 gal water everyday😂
Transparent solar panals and plastic eating worms are really god their
This video was the need of the hour. Big salute to you 👍👍
Fast one 10 /10
whats wrong with his dressing sense????😂😂😂😂
I love with the quality of your videos. ❤❤
Your wardrobe ❤❤❤
too much lights 😂 on your face
6:24 Why not just use buckets?
Ahh😫 always rick rolling us 😂
What
10:08 Non-plastic plate  *comes in plastic wrapping*
I need to watch this video after skipping 20 ADs
1:39 AYOO WHATS IN THE BOX BRO ???
0:25 There's no need for that We could reduce the plastic on earth by 80% by assassinating BTS and kim kardashian🗿
the caligula of our time
Mom: Finish your plate Me: mom there is nothing left on the plate what am I supposed to eat- Mom : the plate Me: wha- Mom: eat that plate
FYI  something like Plastic road has already been used in Kolkata. There is a street that was paved in 2021 using just recycled plastics instead of plain asphalt.
One more video in support of vegans and i unsubscribe from every account my family has subscribed to you No hate and no warnings I don't think that we should step down from the top of the foodchain
imagine humanity evolving a *little* more than this
11:57 “Slavery with extra step”
And he does it again.... Rick rolled😂😂😂
And he does it again.... Rick rolled😂😂😂
mrwhosetheboss is the kind of good teacher that everyone loves but doesnt give high grades
Nice dress up 😂
And I've tried tons of it I'm trying tons of vegan food and cheese sucks the mayonnaise sucks everything sucks
Vegan food sucks and it's expensive and you get less of it
No, solar is NOT the way. The lithium is limited, and not sustainable!
7:15 This made me think of പുണ്യാളൻ അഗർബത്തീസ് 😌
I wish you would do just a basic fact check. For example the drones that you say can plant 20.000 trees per day, would be a tree planted every 4.32 seconds. From that you need to subtract down time, charging, restocking seeds etc. etc.  TLDR: It's bullshit.
🔥🔥🔥
What happens with the house if there’s no sun or wind?
Would you rather pay a lot of money for a real leather jacket or the same money for  a phony leather jacket thats the way I see it 🤨
You the eco capsule looks like majin buu's house lol
the background music is pretty cringe
have you ever seen a Russell Brand video?
Every bottle of shampoo or bodywash you but is its own separate plastic bottle.........shows fully recyclable pressurised metal can. GG
The only way I can see that drone planting 20000 trees in a day is spraying out seed from 100ft out. There are product claims out there that needs fact checking. Throwing out seeds is not planting trees.
Tasty plate
Biodegradable plates... but they come packaged in plastic. I mean sure it's less plastic, but it's also a problem that really needs addressing.
These products are so heavenly and safe to earth, that I had slight faith in Twitter and will regrade and not degrade.
I feel like 22 would’ve been better
This is the best video I have seen so far from U (MrWhoseTheBoss). Completely shocked from the beginning to the end. Thank you. 😍😘
Hi Arun! Really Entertaining video as usual. I was just wondering if you could make a video covering about the controversial upcoming Samsung Galaxy Tab s8 family with the available information/leaks or it's too early for that?.  It would be Awesome to know if it's worth it waiting for the release a few months in the future (considering the overall specs and price ofc) or just go with the available s7+? because I really need to get a laptop replacement tablet for schoolwork and gaming. Help please 😭❤
Anyone else getting 6 ads?

hi
Is that the missus head in the bbq cutaway?
Also should have added solid state batteries 😉😄
11:01 ehh...inc
Did u notice when he started talking about the biohybrid buildings it said  mi on the yellow part
Mmmm no judging on your COSTUME ✌️
06:11 right now?? Rickroll
The soap bottle is a horrible idea. I touch my shampoo bottles when my hand is wet. Might just dissolve the bottle before finishing the contents.
Arron, Could you put links to all the products you review in your description please? Some of them look awesome!
Just add caveats...some of the things on the list may fall short as advertised. It has happened before and will always happen. It will really be good for all of us if these products hold up in the future.
Never bring religion as a joke or for funny purpose. Respect the Religion with decency, I feel like people nowadays find religion as joke, and they think they'll walk freely after making and using religion as funny or marketing tool. I wish everyone will think about it, we have forgotten our religions (That's why we are getting the worst of humankind).  1. No humanity. 2. No one is taking religion seriously.
That forest drone planting 20k trees per day made me and dad go "whaaaaaaattttt!"
16:49 I knew he was sus
This is great and all but, guys we need an invention that will fix the political world...
when i was like p4(primary 4 at the age of 10) for my science project i had to take care of mealworms
Massive fleshlight 8:43
How many minutes did it take film the shampoo place 😹😹. I’m sure it took hours
This man is always making researches 😹😹😹. I like the energy
3:51 what type of ending up in animals are you talking about
The fact that he could literally wear any outfit and look fresh 👌
I hope this was a joke, otherwise please stick with tech, doesn't seem to have been any research done here. Loved your previous videos... this, not so much, very disappointed
Clothes from plastic... What a healthy idea.
PLEASE SAVE THE WORLD
By now, Arun has a world record of rickrolling us in almost every video.
Most of these are good ideas but the plastic roads concept is only ideal in areas that are extremely far away from natural environments as the plastic can leach into water during rainy days and get stuck in the environment, something that has been a major problem with water bottles for a while.
Wait wait waittt is that a drink from Cha Time!!!!!! 4:06
rick rolling us again 7:35    badboy
thats why i use buckets for a bath!
Jesus of YouTube 🤣
can i get huel  in australia
Wth is this theme Arun? 🤣
Me like that costume almost as much as me like this video... it's divinely awesome. 👌
Plastic can melt easily so in cities like Dubai the roads will melt on a hot day  Rest of them are good for the environment  Also luv your vedios 🙂🙂
poo paper is from sri lanka
We made aluminum ovens to cook s’mores in engineering
Isn't divine and godly the same?
I need to stop watching British YouTubers. I'm not gonna know how to pronounce anything.
New get up new impration
the vegan leather is such a cool concept but the owner of pinatech stole the invention from filipinos by pantenting it so it is no longer available to be produced by anyone else
I just noticed there's a Motorola logo behind you
Help my card 44 $ help help
Help my card 55$ help help
11:30
He reviewed everything in a single video, from buildings to pens to food....also he has taken the pun game to a whole new level
Looking like a Greek God who knows tech🤣
Where have you been😑
his outfit is cool ... ngl XD
Being vegan is absolute trash for your health.
@ 10:09 the irony in number 7........! the "edible plates come packed in the deadliest environmental killer number 1 "transparent plastic film" to reduce packaging costs because cellophane film is too expensive
Arun Ceaser?
Try shopping from Cartlow ,Keep it up nice vids
Number 2 does not make any sense it seems kinda lazy
Pavegen reminds me of this one time when an alien got angry because someone invented a universe inside a box to reduce the amount of effort to harness energy
You missed the opportunity to say da façon is bakin
Watch the video in 0.25x speed. (Not necessarily the full video) It was very funny 😂😂.
Everyone is gangsta until your lil brother EATS POO PAPER
I sure hope that's the only plate you've tasted....
10:09 wait… what are those plates wrapped in?
My man is caesar
*I thought techburner copied Arun.* Until now.
one of the reason this guy is famous is because the good quality, color grading, editing, and good lighting which made him look so proffesional (I mean he's proffesional). unlike other smaller youtuber, this guy is effortful
4:09 That's what she said
"Restore your faith in humanity"  Yea.. They really don't, and for the same reason that my faith in humanity was gone in the first place, greed. Most of the inventions will not see the light of day in a low income home within the foreseeable future. Even if they did, and we managed to 'save the planet'; we're still stuck with the ignorant greedy pricks running things. So it still won't be much of a planet worth living on for those of us stuck in the low income bracket.
Please do the Samsung 21 FE
My Man 😎
Hats off to editor
7:10 just focus on whats drawn on the paper
Rick Roll at 7:09
Oml I look 😏🤌
We already have someone saving the world it god
whi was the girl photoshoped in the barbecue  portion
Vegan teacher approves
3:50 which is exactly why instead of banning them, the government should have...you know...make sure whoever manages the trash doesn't throw it to the sea?
.
I fell bad for the editor
10:57 "Still the tastiest plate I've ever had" 😂🤣
Nice! 😁
6:45 but don’t you need electricity to create that 3 times pressure
didn't know people took 25 minute showers, and I can't cut my shower time down by 2-3 minutes because I already take 2-3 minute showers lol
7:12 are you kidding me mrrickrollboss
thank god that the 1000 glasses in our room were not real
Imagine eating a plate...🙄😂
In South Africa pineapple plants isn't burned, it's mulched back into the ground with a mulching machine, I know so as I repair these machines for the pineapple farmers, so buy South African pineapple as we don't pollute the world.

The wheat bran plates... wrapped in plastic wrap
Plastic roads aint that good since when they degrade they pollute the air with micro plastics again, which is worse than plastic bags
It's 2022 so thee should have been 22
No.7 - Who uses plastic plates and cutlery? That’s just weird.
Jesús save the world :)
wait. Halal bacon?
MrWhoseTheBoss dresses like a Roman god for this video I Love this guy
I Love MrWhoseTheBoss Videos 😄
He always rickrolls us
Nice
10:14 us nepalese who have been making leaf plates as a tradition for years: pathetic
Thumbnail 😂😂😂😂
Co2 come from new trees
This man will eventually run out of words to get people to subscribe.
Who else noticed arun"s female version in barbie q 🤣🤣🤣🤣
16:20 that's what she said     he literally comes the second we stop recording
Oh my sugar jesus
Who's that lady at 8:28 whose face is overlayed 🌚🌝
Those tiny eco homes are a scam lmao basically a self sustaining dog kennel for $50k! Classic neoliberal approach to fixing the housing issues, let's put poorer people in a capsule so the upper middle class and above can continue consuming like crazy
Mrwhosetheboss should be the new ceo of heaven
Don't mind me just burning my packaging
Salute you because no other tech channel think about nature and humanity
14:18 my math teacher helped start that company and I think still does stuff for it occasionally
😇
0:52 Put this back in my cloud storage  The humor of this guy😂
That rockroll was impressive
Just a reminder to everyone. Just because we have these technologies now doesn't mean we can go back to our less environment conscious ways. Most of these still need time and resources to develop and mature. We need to buy these companies and products time.
If you pin this you will hit 10M Subscribers soon! Really love your content.
well what can i say, this video hueled me up to live to see these technologies evolve. guess im not gonna give it up now.
The major issue with Plastic roads, is as cars, people and bikes go over them, they release micro plastics that will get into everything. Its not a good idea.
One problem with plastic roads is that the plastics will wear out slowly and leech into the ground affecting groundwater and cause devastating effects on our water supplies and ground composition, not to mention the deadly chemicals they could release.
All good ideas but everything have another side. You can't have to make a coin just with 1 side there is always 2 side of a coin.
The plastic covering on the the Biotrem😂10:09
Hey everyone! :D I hope you stay safe and have nice day, God bless you! <3
I totally forgot about those pens exists
He had that custom for ages, so made this tech video to suit it
So yeah that's my whole problem with pollution stuff why isn't there just a law that you have to filter 100% of the air from the waist of your product and then dispose of the filters properly to where they don't alter the environment ? Like it shouldn't be that big of a deal to filter the air from factories which is one of the largest contributors to global warming.
It's his best video yet. Thank you so much for making such a great collection.
Am I the only one that just realized that on the left of the video there’s a count   P:S great inventions wish I could get them
I can see one issue with the soap bottles, because there’s no way they could withstand even a single shower
Jotaro seeing him saving the world: yare yare you are my enemy
10:09 Covered in plastic lol
What do you edit with?
the biotrem since its edible would be bio degradable so you could use it in your garden forsay
What about the sharks and the other ones
There’s a woman edited into the grilling scene. Is she related to Arun?
Vertical Axis wind tree was my final year project 🤩🤩🤩🤩
Only Jesus  can save the world  u need to repent
Never knew about these things. Thanks for the Video
What's the next phone your gonna look at?
No kids are going to eat paper after seeing that 6:52
My car supposedly had vegan leather.
And ya i did plant 2500+ tree over our wood's eevry one fo you shut did minimaly same is just 8 weak weakend work on air with pincher... ez..
I needed this video to lift my mood. Thank you so much ❤️
I really hope the edible plates take off.
Fun fact, the problem with plastic roads is that they dump out about 1000x more microplastics than the leading source of microplastics... Tires. So, while they're helping visual litter, they're exponentially increasing invisible litter... Which is the whole reason visible litter is bad.   To explain further: we are not worried about water bottles in the ocean just because they'll stay there, but rather because the ocean waves will break off particles, or microplastics. Those get eaten by fish, which are eaten by birds, animals, and people. These microplastics are really the "big bad" here, so the plastic roads are actually making the problem WAY worse. (Microplastics cause cancer, genetic issues, cell damage, etc. Etc.)
Gooble boxes? Did you create my universe!?!
I don't have natural enzymes to break down milk. I'm suing you for saying that.
To really save the World would be to wipeout as many humans as possible.
All pray our lord and saviour, jarun
14:57  Someone please tell me the name of the backround music brooo it’s so epic just like this video
soon in the future every building gonna be green and full of water
What I like about this guy is that he is really good at just getting to the point. He doesn’t over explain, there’s no unnecessary suspense, he doesn’t try to milk one topic or joke; he just says what he needs to say and moves on. It’s informative without being exhausting. That’s quite a talent in my opinion.
Nice
God level attention to detail ✨✨
This is the perfect video why we need free markets. Perfect video thank you !
17 minutes well spent
The most amazing video I've seen today .
:)
there are more BS (from greenwashing to impossible stuff) project in this list than real ones. Maybe I just don't understand this and it was sarcasm the whole time?
One thing most people don’t realize is for every tree that is cut down for paper five are planted in its place otherwise all paper companies would go out of business. Poo paper is still a cool idea though for the elephants especially
The irony though... The 'alternative' at 10:10 is wrapped in plastic... Mankind never learns!
We’ve all heard about the drone one from Mr.Beast.
I thought he just wanted a reason write the toga off… cloud storage pun included
IS the Huel bags made of plastic? ;)
Gallons but not litres????
I fell asleep with autoplay on and woke up to arun dressed like julius caesar
90% of them are bs.
And for your information heul plastic bag is biodegradable 👍
I love your content I liked the video because I love your content but please don't pretend to be God PS with love somebody how loves your content regardless
I kind of hate doing this, but 90% of this list...is kinda rubbish. Here is the caveat list:  (21) Plastic containment should be priority, not reusing (20)  Just don't check which synthetics are used and how much energy it costs... (19) Only if the fungi isn't foreign to the ecosystem you dumped it in, else it may render the soil toxic to the plants that grow there (18) Fashionable, but expensive and low yield (17) Low oxygen yield (16) Incredibly high maintenance (15) highly Inconvenient requiring you to find faucet after use (14) just average food replacement (13) OK, though not feasible on large scale (12) Be sure to check your home got the required water pressure for it!! Very common mistake (11) like 13, small scale at most.  (10) These small generators have very low output (9) Expensive, but sounds ok (8) Ok is pretty neat retro-futuristic design (7) just use ceramic plates (6) seems fishy since Carbon Capture is very immature, yet they get enough for that much ink??? (5) Incredibly maintenance heavy (4) Already proven to not be quite as durable as advertised and contaminate nearby soil with (micro)plastics due to wear by wheels. (3) Plastic turned digestible been "coming" for decades, it never makes that step (2) Reforestation has become highly debateable on effectiveness on Carbon Capture (and is mostly rendered moot by deforestation). (1) Transparent panels have very low efficiency as most energy is in our (near) visible spectrum and they themselves are incredibly energy intensive to fabricate (don't forget the assisting hardware!).
These inventions are epic! And it makes a really nice change to see a positive video on the environment and future.
I saw that little, that's what she said, at the paper straw
The Huel bag is made of plastic. Yea the Huel bottle is also made of plastic. Though it might be recycled, but it’s still plastic🥲. Thanks for the advertisement.
No vegan bacon can be better than a good juicy meat one
The plastic roads is a brilliant idea.
Wow! All of these inventions seem very fun and sustainable! (Saving some animals in the process and destroying plastic with mealworms would be great add-ons as well) Although some are still in its early stages, we all hope that it progresses over time. Solartastic! 🌞
Why did he rick roll us :(
wouldn't a soap bottle get wet in the shower + disintegrate?
I just bought pants with a green bottle shape hanging from it and Repreve was written on it
Coolest straw: the pasta straw ( exists )
Lit ep huel is actually good
DID YOU KNOW THIS EDITING IS REALLY ANNOYING?
Great video. We hope to have all that innovations be produced faster.
i cringed every time he said "algeeeee"
:0
Number 1 is extremely awesome for humans and but I can imagine it fucking up many other animals who come inside the house. It might simply turn others blind lol. Hectic.
But what if transparent solar OLED screens on phones, then you'd never really need a charger unless you're inside, if their efficiency is significantly increased
Agree with everything here except the the vegan shit
I want an eco capsule
Why is that laurel leaf looked magnetic and just clasped to your forehead.
Insider probably covered at least half of them.
Good luck trying to supply the whole worlds paper consume only using elephant poop haha😂 (still the idea is wholesome)
"I'm feeling wet just thinking about it" Mrwhosetheboss 2022
Thanks!
Mrwhosetheboss, I used to highly credit your opinion, but that has now went down a bit. Plastic Roads is a fad. Its been a concept for years now and it still hasn't hit the market. Plastic is too soft its not durable, ill degrade from uv rays, expand and contracts under extreme temperatures and crack and so much more. You should've done more research than shilling a concept.
I suggest you make this video:The Outbreak of Jellybean's "✨It's not a mistake, it's a masterpiece✨"
.
Ask the worm to destroy earth please
Hi,im from south africa and honestly i think its an absolute joke that some people take 25 minute showers mine usually last for 2 mins max.
When I heard 'a building that's actually alive' I instantly thought of the signal tower in Little Nightmares 2
invention number 3 almost makes all before it useless lol
Love the irony of the "eco-friendly" reusable plates being wrapped in plastic foil. A remainder that all of thees bio companies are still... companies. Their top priority is still profit, and currently the most profitable thing is plastic.
Great video love it!💗💗💗😆👍
The effort and research that goes into such videos💯
Why aren't these things in my country! They are amazing Good video, thanks for spreading the word ^-^
10:09 "Made of WHEAT BRAN" but rapped in plastic.
Arun, how can I get to have a one on one chat with you. We need to move on in my country
Yea...I don't buy the hole global warming carbon ideological club.  I do agree on the pollution, that is an issue. We can say thanks to the world billionaires (most of them are the ones causing it in the race to get richer)
Not 21 toxic tech, It's 19... At the end of the video
You are on a different level bro👏🏾👏🏾
how does Mrwhosetheboss have the same shower head as me?
Huel's packaging certainly won't save the world....
We should use number 5 for those arcade games where you have to press the buttons in time
Keep growing like this and you'll become the jesus of tech community
number 9 felt like a crappy youtube scam ad
The Tesco's bag at the beginning killed me 😭😭
10:15 are they, wrapped in plastic. Doesnt that ruin the purpose.
So many verified users commenting on this video
nah listen, we use poo paper to create paper straws
This guy always manages to pull out a Rick roll of some sort 😂😂😂😂
Him saying I can digest milk but im lactose intolerant
This episode is gimmicky I’m sorry I have to say a few things  Elephant tusk is always more sought-after the elephant dung paper, good intention but can’t see how that actually changes people‘s perception.  Foldable straw has the same issue as boxed-chopstick, it’s the convenience issue. In China people try to use mini chopsticks in a box in place of throwaway chopsticks, didn’t work because nobody want the hassle of cleaning.  What if the soapbox melts in the shower?  Algae inside of glass tubes constantly heated by light? there’s a chance that chandelier will turn dark dark dark green.  I’m only halfway through the episode and I want to point out the biggest thing we can do is to consume less hence lowering production. A new product line will cost a lot of emission of green house gas and consume ton of resources just to make it happen.
If you're reading these comments, and are not illiterate like the channel owner, please join me in pointing out to him that the channel name is grammatically wrong. It should be : Mr Who's The Boss
I really love the way you make such videos, man. You’re amazing. I always look forward to be a content creator like you.
6:47 thats what she said
now i wondering what type of phone do you use i have seen so many of your  videos and i always wondering is it nokia iphone samgsung WHAT IS IT
$0.50 per tree ?! 20000 tree per day = $10 000 !  HUMAN tree planter still WAY cheaper.. and what's up with the floating HEAD in the barbeque video ?!
I don't care about saving cows
Dude, i`ve been watching your videos since 2015, and they have gotten better by the day! But unlike other YouTubers that grow in subs and followers and whatnot, you are one of few who aim to make it better, and still go for quality vids over quantity <3 So much respect for that! Honestly, 100 top YTs put together, couldn`t entertain me more than you do. Stay saye out there!
Cardboard breaks down 2
loved it !
and plasticroad not going to be a huge rainslide? in places where it gets very wet
6:47 ayo 😂😂
yo what's on paper
Make video about scam app in gallery
about that egg a like home, how a bout the bathroom?
5:17 how many takes did that take you? Never seen such a smooth catch
Oh, good Lord....the "paper = save a tree" crap again.  Trees used to make paper pulp are a CROP....they are planted 2 to 3 for every one harvested.  We don't suggest not eating bread to save wheat....this is no different.  Some may think these are old growth, California-redwood forests being cut....not the case.   Paper industry is using the trees they planted around a decade ago.   Further, the demise of the newspaper industry cut paper production 2/3 of what it used to be.  Excellent points on plastics....good job on that.
Thanks
a live counter... WOW, you believe that BULLSHIT ?
13:55 The irony of that plastic tree 😓
Soapbottle... why not simply use hard soap without the liquid inside ?
Realising you have been licking your fingers to turn pages in a book made of poo paper
This man is so close to 10M, share his channel w your friends so he can reach this milestone
You make awesome content 😎
Number one got me speechless
oh i kept seeing those weird trees and wondering why not just plant trees but now I know :)
The downside to #7 is that people like me with gluten allergies cannot eat on it
How did you make it in Youtube?
Can you please keep using the divider in the videos? Great video as usual
A suggestion for your next video's lovely word about subscribing to the channel: sublime.
10x10x10 glasses of hot water ewould take up just 1m^3 even puting one layer of glasses would take up below 26m^2 soooo... yeah not that much space, still a lot of water.
Can i take a 67 watt fast charger from oneplus/xiaomi and plug it into my samsung galaxy s21 ultra?
14:32 So basically parents who are....  helicopter...par...ents  ba-dum-tsss!!!
You give me second hand embarrassment.
Speak for yourself, not all of us produce lactase 😩 (coming from a lactose intolerant dairy lover 😜)
What if the plastic eating worms were to escape containment and eat everything that is made of plastic? Not such a great idea is it. I like number 1 though.
Leathercrafter here While i agree with a lot of things you showed, "vegan leather" is simply crap Like the other leather-like imitations, it could look like leather to someone that has no idea what he's looking for, but is not even remotely close to having the qualities of real leather. The strength, the quality, the durability and versatility. Give that stuff a few years at most and it falls apart in your hands. Also, remember that the vast majority of leather itself is made with the waste of the meat industry, so it's material that would otherwise be wasted.
Hey I was wondering what phone you thought was the best? I've saved up quite a bit and want a professional opinion on what is best. I don't care much about looks so performance and camera quality is what I'm looking for, so what do you think? Love your vids btw, keep creating this incredible content.
I do have live mealworms at home to feed my bearded dragon and those buggers managed to eat their way out of the plastic tub where i keep them. They'll eat anything you give them.
HOLY FUCK  50000 EUROS IS CHEAP?! THATS INSANE DUDE YOU CAN BUY A APARTMENT IN POLAND FOR 2.3 TIMES LESS
I like how he's dressed as he is but still needs to promise things to us. Haha
10:30 i can finally pursue my dreams of eating a plate
I wonder how many takes Arun does to catch the stuff thrown at him without even looking at it
10:12 Indians have been doing that since more than a century, surely we cant be famous
Thank you for rickrolling me with a poo paper a potato chip add a file a commment on a video
''im feeling wet just thinking about it''. -  Mrwhosetheboss 2022
"put this back in my cloud storage" LMAO
all the modern teslas are equiped with vegan leather seats.
heavenly inventions are for heaven...not for this world
2022 just started and we already know what the most exciting video of the year is.
Why did he dress up like zues
eowow
Pass. On all of it.
Monetize the elephants! Harvest their poo!
Arun knows how to blew our mindes, Well done .
Hope every countries goverments have the funds and mindset to implemebt these awsome inventions
Best video Yet !!!!
#14 is wrong
He looking for content for videos to make lameeeee
Vegan leather is BS, I have had so many clothes made of it and it falls apart in like a year, not even close to the quality of real leather so no thanks, if you want to over pay for some crap that you will throw away every year then sure.
Just hope thunderf00t doesn't see this, i guarantee you more than half of these are literally dead on water and nothing more than fansy CGIs
6:47 Me too ,Whosetheboss, me too
Huel is AWFUL. I tried it for several months. GAG!
happy to see our poo papers in the list lmao ( sri lanka btw )
The toilet paer joke curent tissues
A bout 2 decent ideas. Much crap.

Can you make a video of Nokia x100 review?
Why not go Vegen: beefsteak is delicious, real leather is a natural material…..
The actual Tech channel!
Heya Mrwhosetheboss! Can you review the romanian Ihunt phones please?
As an American we can't have ecocapsiles because these greedy people will arrest you for harvesting rain water and you have to have permits to collect solar power
Who uses plastic plates dude
6:46 arun caught in in 4k
That heul bag😑
Plastics roads make sense. You can make them rugged enough and water will not wash them away so hopefully no potholes.
Great content amazing inventions but a presentation that almost painful to watch
Plastic road is not good, it creates more micro plastic cause by wear and tear. More mirco plastic in air around road and more mirco plastic in the soil. While microplastic doesnt have a direct impact on people  (that we know of yet)... not sure if we want to inhale micro plastic for decades.
ngl i dont enjoy your videos anymore, they're just too much funky and feature useless stuff
OMG! please sstop pretending you know anything about tech and environment. Either you don't know a thing or you just don't care and promote scamming or disingenuous corporations. No pumping more technology into more products that cost more energy and ressource to make will not solve magicaly our polution problems. If you want to solve the climate crisis you gona have to start consuming less energy and ressources, their is no magic tech pill to save us. And this guy is just selling tech quakery and spitting back whatever marketing pseudo scientific arguments he is payed to tell. This is not tech journalism this is environmentalism fraud on top of tech ignorance.
Americans use so much water, everyday I learn something new about this country
It's one of the best video i have ever seen. Nice content.Thanks a lot.
It PAINED me to see you give the edible dishes such a high mark WHEN THEY CAME WRAPPED IN PLASTIC... AAAARGH!
"I was there, and he said shave the world." -Ignignokt (Dave Willis)
10:09 oh yeah the bio plates not made out of plastic but still wrapped in plastic
Aron:this is the best plate i have ever had  Me:what the heck????????
This is so awesome! More of content proving how much of amazing stuff human intellect can produce!
non plastic plates but they are wraped with plastic LOL
Cleaning this straw may in some cases use more water then production plastic one. I don't get straw idea at all, but main problem with straw and plastic in general are people throwing it wherever they want. If Air Ink takes pollution from the air wouldn't be this ink just toxic if gets on your hands with this concentration?
Pineapple leaves ain't trash really. Some countries, including Philippines are using it for jusi fabric.
I would love to support these items helping the environment but the reality is that almost all of them are too expensive for the average consumer
Heavenly inventions indeed.  👌🏿
1:02 damn thats smooth
You know what is truly godly?  Not using a straw.
why would this get 2.2k dislikes
Europeans buying a fucking tear drop camper for 50 grand and you thinking that's a deal is just hilarious lol like dude I know you needed to expand your list but that one's such a scam it's not even funny.
Yoooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Not buying leather doesn't save any cows. Sorry.
hey im not gonna lie can you rate all the famous video games pls
Imagine walking into a kitchen and seeing someone eat a plate
Can u do a motorola g71 review
i wish there was this  invention where whenever you open the door, you generate electricity out of it. Maybe really  good for using it in office. Probably i just gave someone a idea to do that.
Was that your gf photo that showed in the video
Nice Costume
Best tech i ever heard, thanks really enjoyed
Uses Rick lol
3fm serious request 2021 used somthing like number 5.
Huel is directly making Sattu or Chatua.
Planting trees with drones? Your research could have been better. There are several projects that have been debunked (the plastic road is not durable at all, the wind turbine power bank is inconvenient as hell and are we actually going to cut down living trees to have wind turbine ones instead?
What's wrong with you Arun? 50 ads in one single video 😭
Just talks to fast
All the things 1 side...   Ur dress...  Absolutely beautiful 😊
Huel Link doesn't work 😕
Please make a Collab. Video with @TechBurner🙏🙏
" planting trees "  (uses a plastic tree) hahaha
Although the plate is cool, some people are allergic to grains.
bro ngl that bacon took forever to fry
I buy shampoo conditioner and soap like one container a year I am sick and tired of people falling for the gimmicks that large companies put in the news to avert peoples attention to themselves being the problem instead of the actual companies that make plastic or use plastic stuff it is not our fault that we need to buy shampoo and conditioner it is not our fault that you’re more likely to find plastic bags at the Grocery store like you have to think of the actual source that’s like saying a baby is at fault for being a crackhead because their mom did crack while she was pregnant with the child you see what I’m getting at
He even has a sheet of paper with rick astley in 7:10 am i the only one who realized this! 😝😝
Channel best video so far and best I've seen in a very long time.actually made my day
Plastic roads have one problem.... They introduce more microplastic into the environment.... And at large scales it can tip in the wrong direction
The plates reducing Plastic, wrapped in plastic 😂
Some of these are great during the apocalypse
imagine the plastic road workers after realizing mealworms exist
So he Rick rolled a with littoral shit paper
"Let Nero fiddle out Rome's obsequies."  --George Daniel, 1649 [obsequies are funeral rites.  George Daniel's comment is the only one that matters here.  Most of the other eight-thousand comments in this stream are ephemera.  In fifty years, the skeleton crew might read back and find here the list of fools who appended their praise.]
7:11 That's Rick Astley on the paper ... I'll leave here  , maybe somebody missed it .
Once your done with the clothes the plastic still exists as waste.
10:09 literally plastic around them in that shot
I swear the videos are sometimes delayed cuz he couldn't find a good costume
Can you eat the vegan leather?
Next time, you are crowning your head with Fresh Flowers 😟 not those plasticky papers, Arun, How about addressing your Audience with a Vase of Fresh   Assorted Variety of Flowers ?  Peonies, Roses, Daisy, Dahlias, Jasmines, Tulips, Lotuses🌹🌸🌹🌺🌷🌼🌻🍁🍀🌾⛄❄🌀💝💞💖😍
There is currently more standing timber in the US than there was 100 years ago.   FACT

Plsz  make  a video on best under budget (120-170 $) phone award.
Where's the huel??
The tastiest plate I've ever had 😂😂😂
MOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Loved this video. Keep them coming. 👍🏿
i saw something below the screen on 2:41
Beautiful creature....
6:10 How did you know😳
The down side to wheat bran plates is some people are allergic to wheat, like me.
its weird how the plates come in plastic
Fact that he pulled out a plastic tree for a tree Xb
the No.1 made me dread for Solar freaking roadways, but was given an actual good invention lol
Who uses plastic plates aren't they called paper plates and nobody buys styrofoam those are terrible
We're a HUGE fan of this video! Thanks for including the Shine Turbine and for drawing attention to so many other future-forward, innovative, and environmentally friendly inventions. Great round-up!
Guys he’s rick rolling us every minute
Last time I checked micro droplets are also known as Mist, and fast mist is painful.
The main problem with the plates is that some people can't eat or touch wheat like me. I have celiac disease so I can not interact with wheat, rye, or barley
Let's live in a pod and eat bugs so that big companies can keep polluting the earth for a few more decades.
Didyou really wear that outfit for the video😂😂😂
Patron Saint of Gadgets, Arun.
1:01 good catching arun
Algea Buildings soon we will see anlgea Powered phones.  And I all for it.
And the references?
Great video
I am praying for everyone who needs a Healing, Breakthrough and Miracle. Only God can do the impossible, He can make a way when there seems to be no way. Today I pray God touches your health, your home, your family, your faith, and your finances in Jesus Christ Name Amen!
The best way to describe how much I love to watch your content is the fact that your videos are the only ones I watch at normal speed instead of 1.25x or 1.5x. I love every second of it so I just want to enjoy it at its best
Bro using 100 Gigawatts with his 20 8k monitors in the background and talking about inventions to safe the enviornment lol
9:24 ayo elon musk where you at bro?
A quick info on SOAPBOTTLE, apparently they couldn’t meet the deadlines or production, and the started giving back the Kickstarter money. So it seems that this won’t happen 😔
You eat from the plate, I eat the plate. *we are not the same*
I have 2.5 minutes of shower every day. I don't know how to shower for minus half minutes every day... 🤔
Ayo why he wearing an Emporer's robe??
Oi YouTube I want this video on trending
7:11 I just Rick rolled by a piece of paper
Hello people  I'm asking advice and ideas from you (people of any country)[[not a joke]]  Could you please give me advice and ideas that how can I help the needy people of my country to make them established for forever?  [N.B: im asking for advice because I believe everyone is blessed differently so everyone will have different ideas which I might even can't imagine ..so share your ideas.Thank you.]
Arun, I think you should create a membership perk, we'll surely subscribe you monthly
thank you boss for this eye opening information.
The problem of energy will be solved soon and most of these stuff will become obsolete
Number 5 is obviously copied from Rick and Morty.😅
The link for huel is not in the description
I don’t produce lactase :(
Sooo you can buy green plates packed in plastic 😂😂 anyway, great tech list 😁😁
12:00 This sounds like a cool idea but we all remember what happened to those "solar panel roads" in france lol.
the fact that he uses words to make good jokes like Inkredible is awesome
7:14 we got ricl rolled by him
He said the drone planting trees can plant a tree for 50 cents a tree and one drone can plant up to 20,000 trees. So that's $1 Million Dollars per drone per day.
heaven
There inventions are juts mindblowing. I hope in the future people pay respect to this, to save the planet
I Wonder whose came up with the name Facon. I dare you to say it 10 times.
Half of these are non viable options and they make more problems than they solve, and some of them are literally almost 30 years old... like that edible plate, I remember seeing that in Japan in the '90s made from rice.
Ever heard of Ecosia?
Not gonna lie, all of these sounds like the next Solar Roadway - sounds super cool in theory, but next to impossible to properly scale.
Plastic roads breakdown to microplastics which in turn gets absorbed by the ecosystem , which is bad in the long term
Watching you when you have 1 million and now soon you'll achieve 10 million love from Pakistan ❤️
How about adding captions to your video? It also part of saving the world inventions.
fake bacon = facon 😂😂😂😂 sorry
start working out buddy it's getting bad
i wonder what That Vegan Teacher will think about the vegan bacon
Very nice ❤
Fuk da shit vegan thing. We love meat.
Vid idea-Top 20 success
How did you catch that pineapple so effortlessly ? Didn't it poke you ?
Arun is just priceless. He actually does a proper study before presenting to us. He speaks as though he is an expert in the field of any video he is making. 🎊🥰😘
Peeps !!
Rick's not that sh*tty tho Arun haha
The mushroom box will be super if it's  hallucinogenic
well and how do you close that soap bootle ? 😂😂🤣
Hows the smell of the poo paper
sound not sync with video
Eh ecomodernism is flawed
I want ancient theme.
Rondom question are u Muslim
The one thing you didnt talk about is the problem for most of those. The Price tag All of those become a 1/10 when its just too expensive for companies to use or for private persons to buy...
I miss the app videos
Buddy has definitely never grilled before.. they have lids fam
Micheal Reeves meets ZSTRAW.
Um here in Finland we cut trees and replant them to get more paper so why just replant the trees again and again…
Nar. I'm never not going to stop eating meat unfortunately.  Good video though 👍
plastic road is such a simple yet useful invention
free rice
this is fantastic
U didnt ask for that sub to the channel will be Heavenly....😂
👏Good video👏
just where do get these ideas xd they r rly weird but good ❤️
Great 👌👍 looks like this world will survive all the abuses through these inventions
More than half of the products shown are are just novelty products....niche products in that they are unsuitable for mass production and use. while the other products are in the "why aren't they in mass use, like yesterday!? why so slow!!?"
I got a question to ask do you keep the things that you buy or no?
14:33 "more efficient parents" 😂😂😂😂😂
so if the mealworm works plastic useage wont be a problem therfore no need for all the eco packaging
i have seen this eco capsule in expo 2020
Even though they are inventions, most of them will be highly priced and will end up as showpieces for extremely rich people! A sad reality!   Pollution is mostly made by things that are cheap and easily available. So unless these inventions are cheap and easily available, they won't make sense to this earth!
Use bucket for bath instead of shower. 10/10.
Not everything vegan is good.  Also, who the hell showers for 25minutes??!!! If you're still in there after 5 minutes, y'all gonna get ur ass whooped.
3:58 A sub to the channel would suck 😶😂
Nice Team Seas shirt did you donate to the Team Seas?
🤍🤍
"You have lactase enzymes"   *cries in lactose intolerance
6:47 Uhmmmm what
Wooow you are two levels beyond other tech youtubers.
Sorry to see this channel turn to clickbait. This video was full of unbacked claims and talk coming straight from marketing departments.  Unsubbed!
noice!!
Blasphemy 101
Vert Epic
Probably my favorite video by you, ever. Phenomenal job putting together 21 truly life-changing technologies, Arun.
Number 17 is a bad idea. Algea will absorb light and you will need more light to get the same illumination level. Algea is not 100% efficient at converting light to stored energy. Bulbs are also not 100% efficient at converting energy to light. So you end up wasting much more. Just leave algea under the sun. That is the best.
I thought 'restore your faith in humanity' was an exaggeration, but I can actually see this video having that effect on someone.
ancient Greek clothes suits you =)
6:47 thats what she said😂😂😂
Hi🙂
One of the favourites ✨
Liked the content..  please stop over expressions, it was kind of distracting to see all the unnecessary head and eye movement.... other kool..
Pixel 6?
LOL! Let's not forget the Covid jab... 0/10
I love the way his shirt designed to show a bit of his shoulder lmao that is cute ngl
thanks Arun for restoring my faith in this world
The only problem I have with plastic road is that they claimed they used the plastic used in water bottles witch is super weak and whould not work as a sidewalk yes but not roads on the street that cars drive on plus the road is not only the top part a lot of work goes into it but I love your vids number 1 was surprising
12:24 Ive been saying this, Plastic has it's place it just needs a more permanent application
That's what a every "Tech guy" must do on YouTube, Spread awareness. 👌👌
What r u wearing??🤣
Hey @Mrwhosetheboss, you got a plastic headband!
Air ink sounds unsafe, users could accidentally absorb the pollution in the ink by accidentally touching it
He looks Gay in this outfit
Cancer thumbnail
Very nice
About chess i also love them but no one likes it
Aaaarrrrooonnnn mmaaannn😳😳😳 people are creating amaizing inventions and Im just here man🤥🤥🤥 whhhaaaattttt
Okay. So I've always thought about this. What if we have something created that can be fitted on vehicles (a sort of wind turbine) and generate usable energy from the thrilling speed??
needed this 🙂

John 14:6 6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

My hometown is featured in 5:35! Polomolok, South Cotabato, Philippines! Hahahahaha!
bruh 50000 euros is 5 million in my currency edit: cheapest house is 5,885 here
The problem with plastic roads is that when they wear down tiny particles of plastic get washed off and into the drainage system which makes filtration a lot harder as no one wants to drink plastic!
Make a video about the oneplus 10 pro! (It was released on January 13th in China)
I still don't know how the meat industry has led us to believe that leather is a premium material. It is just a byproduct of the meat industry. And they have lots and lots of excess leather there.
The enzyme that worm uses to digest plastic is  *Ideonella sakaensis*
13:50 best invention ever  " . "
Fantastic video!
I'm feeling wet just thinking about it - Nebia Shower 🚿.. 😜
Do you really think poaching idiots will stop killing elephants because elephant crap makes paper? Personally, I think we should hunt poachers and make paper out of their skin.....to use as toilet paper.
Arun, When will humans realize, to admire the Beauty of Elephants or any animals or Reptiles without killing them for trophies or money ?!  Elephants with Tusks are so beautiful, cutting a piece of bones from their bodies when they are alive,   Don't humans have eyes to, there are several Humans Handicapped by Birth !?  MOTHER EARTH.
Poo paper is like wiping ur butt with more sh*t!   Genius
How bout sports products which are on different level  Like something for tt or badminton or football
You know what should be number 1?   An elephant dunk plate.
1:01 the way he just catches the bottle without even looking, that's fyee🔥
Petition to start using metric system so most of the world understands this vids
Remove ads from YouTube we will have good faith in humanity
Arun,  Are you having hairfall too !? Not an issue, it's easy to become a Baby 🙌👶💆👼👪
It's not a mistake, ✨ITS A MASTER PIECE✨
7:50 Talks about good ideas with bad executions while he does that himself
7:01 bit misleading, the paper industry also replants those trees so you know they can sustain themselves
The Vegan Teacher should see this. 😂
Arun, Did You Know,  There are More Reliable Source of Technologies on Earth,  They are called, Eagles, Vultures, Hawks, Parrots, Sparrows, several other birds and Peacocks,  They can Take Care of This Planet, Far Better than Humans Do. All I and U, Need to Do is, Make Some Love, Build Friendships with Them, they will be at our service 😊  I am very high, need to make love with U 😍
Ok

You should actually go to an vaccination center with the dress. its easy insted of pulling it all the way down to keep an vaccine
and he still managed to rickroll us
10:27 they are wrapped in plastic so there is no point
IQOO 9 PRO JUST RELEASED BRO PLS DO A REVIEW IT WILL GO VIRAL
Bro really, plastic roads??? I can’t believe he added that one 🤦‍♂️
I honestly don't know how else to put this, but I'm gonna say it anyway.... Your videos are so inspirational. Thankyou so much for continuing to post content. Love from Australia!!!!!!!!!!!! =D
There are some big issues with some of these. There are people who require single use straws. And wheat bran isn't gluten free so anyone who has celiac cannot use them
#4-someone hasn't seen thunderf00t...plastic roads would never work out...stick to what you (barely) know dude...phones
Best till now😘😘
Arun, the Huel link in the description is not clickable on the phone. ;)
Imagine a parent with 20000 babies 👀
"I'm feeling wet just thinking about it" -Mrwhosetheboss
5:44 never throw food like that Arun😶
Love your videos man. Great videos and better marketing than the companies making these product themselves :P
Imagine when someone hacks your home.
What happened to this Girl ? 8:29
Your thumbnail just made me laugh even before viewing the content in this video 🤣🤣🤣
Isn't that a Roman toga though? Jesus was Jewish I thought 😂😂
What do you think a negative comment how much can effect to you're emotions🤔?  Best theme invention😘
did anyone see that’s what when he said the paper straw is floppy
ssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Lowkey wanna see him do a Prime drink reaction
The Shroom packaging. I'm sure they took it into account, but wouldn't there be somewhere int the world where throwing those packages away would introduce a foreign species into the local environment(?). Just curious.
4:07 thats what she said LMAO
Who hates the ads intrupt in middle of tech videos
yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
4:09 you forgot to put what she said
"Still the tastiest plate I've ever had"    *wait*
This guy is a legend but, "Who only eats one piece of bacon" says my dad. I agree
why was a plastic foldable straw rated at 5 when a company literally making clothing out of thrown away single use plastic bottles a 2 0.0
are you muslim?
i don't know what he is type? TG or G
You stole the videos idea from tech burner seriously bruh 🥴
I just want to be able to recycle some styrofoam I have in my garage.
So basically, this whole vid explained us that how plastic is enormously harmful to everything up on the planet. So again an add-on to this topic was in the sponsored clip. Look how Aaron wore TeamSeas merch which also does the same work of cleaning plastic. Good work Aaron, you are really explaining these topics in a funny and hidden ways which are mostly satisfying to some people (like me).
My man is Jesus XD
It's ironic how Biotrem's eco-friendly plates each has individual plastic packaging
Thanks
The efficiency of the fully transparent solar panels is currently about 1% with an estimated potential of 5%. So they may not be as godly 😬😬😬
5:52 we use tabo in Philippines.
“I’m feeling wet just thinking about it”. That’s what she said. Lmao
I have a thing similar to Z straw, but it can also be bended into a bracelet to carry around easier.
7:10 that's sri Lankan company ❤️
Is it ironic that the text "Godly" is on fire.
“I’m feeling wet just thinking about it “ 💀🤣
Just wow . You are superb ❤. You are very talented in your field. 💖Explanation any topic is awesome💕. You have amazing talent to engage an audience till end of your video. 👏💖 Good luck Foods Box ❤
Ya it’s really 2022  a Egyptian god explaining me tech
4:08 That’s what she said on screen lol
Thanks, Arun for these kinds of innovative videos series. In this video, all the inventions are very nice except 4 since we can't avoid the wear and tear damages. So the plastic road increases the microplastic in the ecosystem. Which will increase its presence in every food supply chain. The good way is to stop producing the plastics or use the enzyme to digest them to avoid microplastic problems.
i never thought in future plates will be edible
Can u do a video about what tech is not comfortable to use please
Maybe one of the best and worthy videos I've ever watched in my whole freaking life!
Hi I really like you’re vids I wish I can buy this but I don’t have the money I like your videos so much 😀
The huel link isnt linked in the description :)
IF IT WAS GODLY HOWN COMR GOD COULD MAKE ALL OF THES IN A SNAP (LOL THANOS )
Never gonna give  u up 🤣🤣
In summer you can use the transparent solar to stop the heat and keep the room cool .
did i just see a plastic pen on number 6? Or is it a different material that looks like plastic.
0:00 that's me plugging my cord into my portable charger and using my same portable charger to charge it 🤣
the ratings on these videos are pointless they always start low and get higher....not unlike the list itself starting with 1 and going to 10 or 20....maybe a little more thought could be given to the ratings or just scrap them altogether
I actually have nebia at home and I totally recommend it
Me reading through the comments to see who needs that Nebula Shower hoarse like me.
all these sound cool but im more worried of the way they are made, glass chandeliers with algea in them sound cool but if they still use power from coal plants its useless, same thing with electric cars, car bodies made from aluminium still need to be recycled or mined.
This line of content could be nice, but right now it's kind of cheesy. Here-and-there is some kind of interesting info, but regarding the full pic it feels like a struggle to make some content... Come on Arun, you can do this better... :/
I know it is the sponsor but it is ironic how the huel bag is literally made out of plastic.
Poo paper what the fuck
I'm confused like what happens when there's to much animal population then what
The elephants poo is made from trees🤣🤣
One possible problem with plastic roads, is that they can potentially release micro plastics. Not that it’s a bad idea.
Great vid Arun
Only I love stevejobs I love apple 🍎 but u really good awesome men 💕👍
Team sea ❤️❤️
He promised
if you want to save water.. use bucket and dipper.. instead of shower😁
Just Amazing!
I remeber the picnic one being on one of this investors shows.
11:56 Japan is laughing at the world😂
10:00 Biotrem: edible plate Me: Pie Crust
no2 really is a helicopter parent huh.
I feel like you're gay. It'd be devine if you confirm.  Our community would have a great tech gay YouTuber representing
Regarding roads made out of plastic, some other video talked about the potential of plastic roads to generate microplastics (through inevitable abrasion) that ultimately end up in our lungs and the rest of the body. If so, what appears to be a great way of putting old plastic to use starts to seem like a terrible idea.
hear me out, solar paneled tesla
12:31
wow, am late for this awesome event😆😆😆
i dont think making clothes with plastic is a great idea.
I would love to see Thunderfoot's opinion on this video :D
some of these are stupid. If we used plastic road then what happens to the tar used to make asphalt, which is a biprodouct of fuel refining and plastic making. the wind power bank seems inefficient. use paper plates and ceramic plates rather than plastic plates (I didn't even know people made plates out of plastic). air ink is just a glorified catalytic converter use. transparent solar is smart but inefficient and impractical since most of our wireless lives rely on the "frequencies of light" that we cant see.  pavegen is inefficient and could probably be done better and was already done before hand in shibuya station. tree planting drone seems to start from seedlings and it takes decades for a tree to grow. there is probably more but I don't want to rewatch rn. feel free to correct me but a lot of this looks smart at first glance but with a bit of knowledge just seems inefficient.
How foolish you are to use the word heavenly, in these materialistic things.
10:08 no way they have put plastic covering over plates that are supposed to reduce plastic use lol
Hi
Ali baba becames caesar😅😅😅
25 min shower.....wtf you doing in there bro !
i think u burned the facon to be honest
Good luck washing off the soap off your head with that weak nebia Garbage
Vegan better for your health?
I hope that potted plant isn’t made or plastic
If only the rest of the world was this interested intro things that could save us
And then the number zero is stop rickrolling
So worms are an invention?
Are we all just going to casually ignore that Rick Astley is on the back of the paper at 7:14
Not sure if those trees want helicopter parents...
I really like the Mealworm concept unless they start gulping everything after plastics are over.
This is so well done, babe. Thank you 😘
I tried Huel once. It's good in smoothies. Sadly I like chewing too much 😂
Noce
Transparent solar is pretty cool
MrWhosetheGod
Plastic roads are beyond stupid.    you take plastic from the ocean or whatever and put it on the land to be slowly shredded into tiny particles by wheels and people waking on it which gets spread everywhere. Tiny plastic in your garden, water, animals, birds, you and your children. They are ugly, and they’re infinitely worse for the environment
Anyone els just randomly start watching him one day then binged his videos
Milk towels in a liquid and and out a liquid
Im Early and Good Job Mrwhosetheboss I Love Your Videos So Much
Vegan leather is even worse than real leather tho… it’s inferior in literally every way. And it’s in no way shape or form better for the planet than real leather. Leather goes straight to the landfill if not used. The cow dies either way, cause everyone loves steak. Only difference being wether the leather gets used or thrown away to rot at a landfill.  The vast vast majority of fake leather is plastic trash.
I wanted to buy huel from long time but the biggest problem is I can't get it delivered to Australia. Is there any option to get it delivered to Aus?
Funny gimmick. I'm gonna go ahead and subscribe. Been watching this channel a while. This knocked me off the fence.
I just got rickrolled by a paper
This man speaks  arial in font size 25
No Huel link on the description tho.
You're a blessing to the world Arun
#7 ah shit, now I have to worry about if the table ware is gluten free
Really like that you added the vegan segments! Most people just skip to waste and water etc. (although they are also important) instead of looking at the industry that pollutes and harms the most! Great video man! :)
Your videos are entertaining, valuable and educate us with the inventions which we could potentially use for the betterment of our planet 💯 Keep going, keep growing 🤙🏼
As an engineering student, unfortunately half of the inventions shown are pure marketing, no real ecologic benefits.
That poo paper has Rick Astley printed on it lol 7:37
Awesome video and crazy weird!! Love your videos man and i am waiitng like crazy for the next weird funny video of yours!! Keep up the good job inspiring us!!
Those this are SOO DAMN AMAZING, makes you have faith in humanity, especially the food that tastes like meat.
do a vdo on Toshiba laptops we want to know wat happened to them btw we love ur vids me nd my bro watch ur vids love Bangladesh :)
Thank you for uploading this videos. I also thank all the owners of the particular inventions to save the world. Great job. Love you all.
10:09 NO to plastic, but... YES to plastic
Such a good quality video!
mrbeast: 1 dollar per tree!!  tree drones: ima end this mans whole career 😈
I like your content ,but Please don’t use the word “godly” here. It’s undermining to the word God, I know you didn’t mean that, it’s the social norm to do it. I just wanted to convey this request, thanks.
14:58 "we made solar panels, but made them give even less energy!" 12:21 startup from 2013 that is yet to do anything after their kickstarter. multiple engineers already proved the roads will be fragile, and the whole "but it stores water!!!" gimmick wont work 11:52 didnt multiple engineers already say this is useless, breaks down, and most of the time doesnt work? 10:59 pollution from air + materials that could be used for something else = expensive marker 9:11 you WILL live in the pod 8:00 i dont think anyone will wait 5 hours to have their power bank only be at 40% 5:49 "we made water go faster, therefore less water is used! (ignore the fact that more water is used because it goes faster)" 4:25 you WILL eat fake meat 3:38 you WILL carry a straw with you everywhere 2:07 i dont think i need to explain why this one is useless. 0:25 you WILL wear expensive clothes that will tear down after 5 uses
in the old old days some countries used stale bread as plates, as the bread absorbs the juices from the food its edible again.
Vegan teacher: Ok okay...  Number 14: OMGGGGGGGG
Hope
I'm trying to understand the wardrobe this came from😂😂😂
my man with the identity reveal
I really love this video! Please do more! Good ideas neeed an ambassador and you would be amazing ! 😀⭐️⭐️⭐️
All plastics should be banned from being used in food containers. Preferably plastics should be banned from all products that are in contact with humans. Semiconductors and the likes are exempted.
Is cloth is eco friendly,   After using it throwing out will be agin ?
Bro the paper straws make the drink so nasty and why dont i get 1 plastic straw and keep on washing it
One thing tho  Why do you have so many ads in every video of yours?
10:30 Biotrem takes finishing your plate to a whole new level
Damn, I guess I’m doing damage to the world by feeding my bearded dragon mealworms
Had a soft drink at a restaurant once, gave me and my friend flavoured straws; he had a lemon one and I had a lime one, they tasted amazing and didn't break down when drinking. only problem is I kept on eating the straw instead of drinking through it lol
I just want to know why I'm not on the list
Where's the power bank that can charge itself?
6:23 that company makes you waste money on heated water cuz the more surface area water has the more heat gets dissipated into the air easy as that
The GTA "wasted" edit was great 😂
I have a set of stainless steel straws that I can use and simply slip them in my pocket like a pen when not in use.
Congratulations from to ten million 👏
The tree planting drones may technically be literal helicopter parents.
Start linking the music you put in your videos
Teacher: What is your favorite food you eat?  Me: *plates*
I love your puns but hate them at the same time they get me to go like o my god he just did that didn’t he
Algea providing light and energy. So cool!
bruh this man just forgot about mrbeast
The first company should team up with team seas and give clothing to the poor/unfortunate
12:18 Actually, this is exciting because there's a new residential complex 5 min from where I live, and they made all the internal streets out of plastic!
Thank you Costco for selling billions and billions of bottled water.
The drones were also used for team trees
love the high end polish on the video; I just thought that the background music was a bit distracting.  I guess it's to the point where I'm at that music and have to click off :(
Recycled plastics for roads, walkways, etc... is a horrible idea given how even more BPA & other toxins will end up leaching into our water and soil over time :'(
The production quality is insane here. Dare I say, the standard.
Mushroom packaging comes as a bonus meal too
Who suggested this outfit might be your..... 😎
Please keep doing videos like this. Love your work ♥️
Repent and be baptized in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
Lads! Arun reminds me of someone. Probably an actor, tv host, comedian or athlete. Unlikely other type of celeb or youtuber. Can you please help me realize who does look alike?
imagine eating you're plate and all the food falls off
Plastic roads... I guess hotwheels had a revaluationary idea even before it existed
the plastic road idea done before didn't work well long term cause like actual roads little bits of it scrape off and now microplastics in the environment was a thing - hopefully the one in this video works :)
He promised more than my dad when he went to go milk😭
50k Euros that's more than enough in my country we can build a full family size home with solar panels all the necessary things installed.
I remember when this guy used to review phones.  Glad he's over that.
Nobody talking about his outfits
What no one realizes is the cost of most of these is way too much to ever be viable
Everyones talking about the ways the earth is being polluted by humans but not many people are talking about the extraordinary ways people are saving it and improving it. like we don't appreciate the fact that we improved the earth so much
He'll always find some ways to Rick roll us 😂😂
But wouldn't plastic roads cause more micro plastics?
Anyone have websites for all the products mentioned?
14:22 mark rober invented adorn e for team trees that does that 3-4 years ago
number 7 edible silverware isn't new
I remember contacting pavgen in the early days.  They have certainly come a long way from changing club floors to designing walkways in Airports.
When your you going to do a video of “A SUB TO THE CHANNEL WOULD BE…..” then all the adjectives you’ve used.
right on, brother!
Am I the only one who visualise that he is on a cloud?
I thought this was ironic... The irony was all there... Till the product effectively started...
"You can control your entire home with one app" Wow, I cannot wait to get locked inside by some hackers for a bitcoin ransom!
disclaimer: plastic not harmed in the video
This video shows how you are unique. All others tech chanels talks only about gadgets. But you talk about technology.
11 seconds in and I'm blown away by the editing
He just gave 21 companies free advertisement
Great top tier content as always.  However I feel Zstraw should have been lower down the list say 2/10
Imagine the pavement that makes electricity for the whole town during lockdown.
Been following you. This just sucks bad though.
So your studio looks like heaven 😅 spectacular
The vegan teacher when she watches this goes like: Omg finally some people that don’t kill animals and use fruits to make clothes.
So glad to see that people care about climate change
Didn't Mark Rober do something similar to the drone planter?
Nice video, like it, thanks for sharing :)
Awesome video! Very informative
Have you ever decided to use just one of the products like the earbuds or the phone
algeeee
How do u find this info tho

Where is the link for huel???
13:39 me who’s lactose intolerant: lucky!
The plastic road is insane, what happens if it gets fire? 🤔
Hey that’s cool
Uau! Made me hopeful.
You should do laptop reviews as well as phones.
The Plates are packaged in plastic
10:55 bri*is moment
That is ending 2021 on a positive vibe.
might have to get some of those high tech tiles! all these inventions are so cool! ✨
I couldn't hit the like in the description to try out Huel 😬
I want the entire world to see this and fund every single one    *Now*
Where do clothes made of recycled bottles go at the end of their lives ?
this takes after you finish your plate to another level lol
those mushrooms suffering though... damn
One of the best videos you've made bro
plastic road, what about micro plastic flying around because its rub away by walking, moving objects?
Hello Moto
Can't bare that costume 🤣🤣🤣🤣 please change
Its not a Mistake✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
I tried that edible plate. I have to say. Its totally Ok. I would never scoff at having my food be delivered to me in such a fashion. But I have to be honest. The plates taste is disgusting. I don't understand how you were able to take such a big bite out of it.
Oh, man... here we go!
The bacon took a while...
Just one point to the Vegan leather. Most of the time when you see a label "vegan leather" it means it´s synthetic varnished plastic crap that looks like leather, breaks after couple of uses, makes your feet boil and then is as awful to dispose of as any plastic. Not every brand does that, but go figure...
This man is so close to 10M
Day 27 of asking for a Z Flip 3
Plastic roads are an old idea. The main reason they are not used extensively is because they release a big amount of microplastic particles, permanently and ~irreversibly damaging the environment around.
Bro u sponsored a product using plastic bag.... 😑😑😑 common arun
so nobodys gonna talk about what was in the mushroom box...
next you should make "21 Tech Fails From Hell"
seriously plastic roadways? Again?
It's a bit sad that I barely see anyone talking about ocean pollution and focusing more on trees. Trees are great and all but wanna know something cool? The ocean stores 85 percent of our carbon dioxide each year and trees only store 15 percent. The way this happens is with algae and plants on the ocean floor. They absorb the carbon dioxide but they feed on fish droppings, and because of ocean pollution fish are dying, and because fish are dying the plants are dying. If you want to know more watch Seaspiracy on Netflix, great documentary
Most are gimmicky or wont get anywhere likely, but its always appreciated when people try to be ecofriendly. Hopefully thoug htat extends to their entire business practice and is not less green than the non-green alternative when you process the stuff
might have to get some of those high tech tiles! all these inventions are so cool! ✨
The only un-heavenly thing in this video in his pronunciation of algae
FUN FACT WHEN YOU TAKE A SHOWER THE WATER DOES NOT JUST VANISH, dang its like yall think that water is a one time use thing
The effort 🔥🔥. Just came out of this video with positive mind
I think the Soapbottle deserves 10 out 10. It's both simple and easy to implement.
Love your videos! Did a deep dive into Huel and it definitely seems compelling. I saw a lot of threads discussing the concerns of lead and other heavy metals in their products. Do you have any more info that could alleviate this concern? Keep up the great videos!
Hi can you please suggest me link to the robe you're wearing please
Dunno, I hope they have good reason to shape the leaves of the windmill like spinning dildos.
Arun, will you hate me ? long term relationship, we must learn to hate each other too ☺
I love these kind of videos of yours
At this point I'm just watching the videos to see the new "a sub to the channel would be" And try to guess it
is anyone killing cows for leather or is it recycled once they would be dead for other reasons?
I am definitely buying the shower thing.
My daily dose of dreams
Number 1 just seems like it could be revolutionary once it can be mass produced and sold at a cheap enough price. Just the thought of putting those in place of normal windows is insane. Being able to power a city just from it. So really the only things limiting it's success is efficiency in generating electricity, cost and mass production
i did a school presetation about transparent solar a few years ago in school and back then they were only able to have about 1% of the efficiency of a normal cell, great to see they've actually made it useful now
Hi Arun, don't get me wrong. While most of the products were great, It's easy to fall for products that seem to solve a lot of environmental concerns but are at best infeasible and at worst harmful for the environment. The plastic road (At 12:40) concept has been debunked by Thunderf00t
Will there be any Top best 2021 android apps review like you usually do?
You deserve a lot subs
why i pick one of your videos on a add brooooo
Amazing video Arun... Keep them going...  :)
Your hair looks amazing in this video.
anyone know of a company at the head of using meal worms for plastic degredation we should buy their stock now
This video made me smile
Couldn't I would be 22 heavenly invitation because 2022
Er how toxic is that ink?
Amazing!
big brain
You legit need to get collections of amazing tech and show it to the people running expo 2020 and make these inventions and their creators more well known
I've heard even an expensive vegan leather wallet lasts under two years.
You like your bacon crispy, likewise.
I used to like this channel but these days it's bullshit anyway I just came to comment
Yo vegan teacher gonna be proud!
You look like nas daily
People fill up bathtubs full of water to bathe, so I decided to fill up the bathtub for 25 min while showering, and it was less than 1/10 of a full tub of water.
My favorite one is the tile that generate energy 💥 then the tree 🎄🌴 planting 🔥🔥 drone which is completely amazing but the mind blowing 🤯🤯one is the  solar panel imagine how much energy a building can  take and still one is able to see (transparency 🤯)
I love this channel
Innovation time: instead of even using poop as paper why wont you use hemp like it has been the normal way since paper existed
Clear solar panels should be on phones
In Australia you won't find any plastic straws anymore only paper straws which don'nt go floppy cause they have a wax coating.
dude owns MULTIPLE phones. meanwhile i cant even BUY 1. send me a phone bruh. (as if he ever will)   greedy.  its not like you use 50 phones a day.
this is one of your best videos, its so nice to see someone that is enthusiastic about clean energy and everything
The 13 and 14 would've been satisfying for that vegan teacher
7:04 seen it on nasty daily
Alot of these are pretty good but I'm giving 11 a pass
a few days back I got a paper straw and I was like wth, it soaked up so I had to drink it without the straw😭
Poo paper is not about to sell😭
theres an edible algae
I watch your videos all the time and subscribed to your channel. This video with your chosen dress code made me unsubscribe. You're making fun of God even just by your theme.  I hope you know the effect of what you're doing.
'Angelic' Seriously
Did u know Elon Musk has created sokar panels that are roof tiles, so your whike roof has hidden solar panels!
Number seven is packaged in plastic 😃
No. Vegan stuff costs usually the same or more due to transport and mostly the same agricutural costs.
"That's What"  ... if you know, you know.
10:10 its rapped in plastic lol
8:42 9.Gosun Fusion is so bad. How are you meant cook steak on that?!
What are you wearing ...love your videos ...👍👍👍👍
Year 1720AD Battle of Jalianwala
The soap bottle thing is dumb. Most people touch their shampoo or facewash with wet hands and their usage over time will reduce the bottle thickness. Also there is probably no way to close them.
😂his dress up can change your mood☀️
Everyone here coming for watch your dress
That thumbnail tho
Love each details of your video
05:50 that is why i never shower, just doing my part to save the universe
Number five is hooked up to Rick's car battery 😉
Vegan Bacon=*YUCK!*
Umm what is that costume like seriously why did you put on that costume for this video
Only Invention to save the World is Jesus Christ.
Man I've been ur fan more tan 2 years soo pls would u do a review on poco x3 GT 5g
I hate to tell y’all, but switching to a vegan leather isn’t saving any animals. These cows are bread specifically to become meat and leather and if we all just became vegan, those cows would have never been bread or exist in the first place. Js.
God! Your hot and I love your videos 😍🔥👍😂🤣
amazing Effort to make such collection in one Video. Many Thanks for such amazing Video
7:24: Look on the paper he's holding. He rickrolled us.
Whoever created the vegan bacon needs to be hung.
MrWhoseTheBoss. Can you talk about China's new blade battery?
Hi
9:20 nani the fuck what do you mean jus 50k i bought a 300m2 house with a yard and a garage for literally half the price?!
I like the idea of 'Repreve' but how much energy does it take to collect, clean, recycle & manufacture their products? Like the idea of 'Soapbottle' but can't find any prices. If people are that concerned about waste plastic, buy a bar of soap rather than the liquid soap that would cut pollution a lot! Mushroom packaging is great, perhaps Amazon should make some sort of investment? I want a wind tree in my garden but at 50,000 Euros I just can't justify it! The biohybrid chandelier looks great but how long will they last? Looked a Nebia & thinking about it! Love the poo paper. The BBQ? There is nothing like the smell of a BBQ & here in the UK we may (if we are lucky) get to use them 4 times a year! You made me giggle with the plate & the 'faken', thanks. Air ink? Brilliant. Lets have that in ink cartridges! Plastic roads are great for cyclists but how well do they behave in frosty conditions & water, how slippery are they? Like everything you said & it made me look at products that I wouldn't normally look at. Thanks for that & all the best............
9:17 my home is 50k € but its not like that small its 2 BHK apartment
6:47 That's what she ..
well its all cool and dandy and saving the world  but what about the prices?
dude our country stareted this poop paper thing in like 500 years ago
The most un Aron looking person that I have ever seen.
Love the robe😁
Huel is good 😄
With this amount of wordplay we'll be seeing Aaron the rapper in the next 5 years😂
A Halo along with olive crown could have made GODLY tier more GODLY 😇😇

Editing mass
Informative n helpful. Thanks
who else laughed when he said am feeling wet just thinking about it
It's his best video yet. Thank you so much for making such a great collection.
BRUH he actually gave a straw 5/10 def sponsored
That's Crazy :D
His costume is hilarious for a tech video 😅😅
My load electrity can get from animal poops 😁
Sir, you forgot to mention the biggest invention that saved the world - " The charger-less iPhone box " 🤣🤣
Number 4, the plastic road, you have to make sure they don't suffer from abrasion. If the plastic gets scraped off from the abrasive contact with tyres and other stuff, then you'd spread microplastic everywhere.
FYI, just because the sweetener is "natural" doesn't mean it's not causing insulin spikes (it is).   Besides raw unpasteurized honey, most sweeteners are empty calories that cause all sorts of damage to all different parts of your body.
Your channel after this video: mrwhosetheangel
8:29 aruni spotted 😂😂😂
4:08 tho
nah dude im calling cap on the 31 billion bottles..
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates~ 🎈
That Chandelier might be the stupidest thing I have ever seen.
I would like to see more of these videos from influencers rather than those endless shein hauls
wow that was a pretty sh*tty rickroll
i hate the dumb dress.
How did that dress feel XD
you're genius
that's not a bright idea
Arun look like a Greece god
Feeling Wet😂🤣😂😂
Number 11 is suspect for long term if it goes off like crazy. You'd then realize that the demand is more than supply. So what you do? Elephant farming. Then you'd have the same issue people have with farms in that the animals are kept not for their safety but for exploitation.
Egyptian Boy
so this is what tinted glass is
Can you speak Punjabi after all you are a Punjabi
Number 12 is kinda sus. Mist type sprays kinda suck at applying pressure thus helping you remove dirt on stuff. I tried this on similar stuff on my kitchen faucet. While it feels good at washing hands, it sucks at heavy duty cleaning and slow to fill up containers.  I suspect the same with showering as well. You'd use a lot more effort to remove your shampoo and soap off your body. This can then translate to slower showering time.

I don’t know if god of universe is real, but mrwhosetheboss is definitely the God of tech 😎 <3
anyone else see that rickroll on paper at 7:24  every rickroll is better than the the last.  .
6:46, That's what she said
Every time I hear him say I promise I say to myself "sure....." Lol
8:29  mrwhosethequeen lol
You are a liberal, aren’t you.
mind opener
😂😂what are you wearing dude?
OMG the bbq is terrific 😂
I never got the whole "humans change the environment so they are bad" argument. Literally every species does that and as far as degrees go humans are babies in it. Go cry to clade cyanobacteria about changing the environment. Of course you shouldn't because if they didn't literally change the entire planet's environment you and every other oxygen breathing being wouldn't be here.
The two that I don’t take offense to but rather see people making a new market for without understanding the reason why the original item is there for are the vegan leather and the high powered shower head. For the vegan leather, i get why people want it. Save the cows, use something that doesn’t have a brain, heart, or nervous system instead. It’s honorable. But if you try to radicate cow leather, then what happens to that? People will still eat meat. We have been for centuries. Yes, the technology is getting better to make other options available, but the skins have to go somewhere. Keep the market for vegan leather, but please don’t let anyone try to make it take over the real thing. You’d be better off taking those pineapple leaves, corn husks, and other similar things and finding a way to turn them into compost for fertilizer or something. As for the high pressure showerhead. People don’t understand that the water treatment and wastewater treatment facilities already have stuff like this in mind. Taking a shower doesn’t waste water. People are just up in arms about bills and they’re trying to find solutions to cut costs down. By design, the wastewater treatment facility is UPSTREAM from the water treatment facility. Wastewater comes in to the plant, the water is treated accordingly with chemicals and natural solutions to get sediment and other harmful things out of the water, then it is manipulated so that the pH of the water and the purity of the water (both in macroscopic material and in chemicals in the water) are safe for the animals in the streams it will flow into. Once the wastewater goes into the river after it has been treated, it travels to the water treatment facility where they will once again treat the water from anything harmful to humans. The pH is readjusted for safe consumption and filtered many times. Once the water treatment plant is finished, they test it to make sure it is okay, send it to your home, and then test in your area to make sure it complies with government standards. If the water wouldn’t be safe to cook with, they wouldn’t send it to you. Then the cycle repeats after you have consumed the water and used it for whatever you need. Washing machine, shower, drinking, watering the lawn (if you’re boojee like that), or whatever. So cutting down water usage in the shower doesn’t make the world a better place, it just makes our wallets a little thicker.
He said "I got a box from xiaomi the other day" Me: another video is coming out in a few days
Transparent solar I rate that a 10/10 not gonna lie
That Vegan Teacher would love some of these
Plastic clothes aren’t great: how do you efficiently recycle/ throw them away
1 ur not the vegan creature, 2 im never going vegan i hope you choose the same
That costume is kinda cringe
No 9  I have a real cheap alternative which cooks better then a barbecue  Electric barbecues ,it cooks better then a coal barbecue
You can also get straws made from avocado pits
The amount of work u put in these videos are mind-blowing. Respect++++
Bro i shared your vdeo to 304 people
Dude what are you? A little girl?
9:11 Can someone tell me what song this is
Company: 20 billion plastic bottles collected! Mrwhosetheboss: 2 / 10
I just wanna say, idk if this was intentional, but there’s 21 items and 3 different tiers, right? 21/3=7 😉 7 is “God’s number”
wow this video is full of positive energy
10:10 love the irony of the anti-plastic product is wrapped in plastic
10:10 love the irony of the anti-plastic product is wrapped in plastic
May be a gloriole would be better with that outfit !
I always see these awesome things online, but I don't think they will be actually be incorporated any time soon
Milo is so sincere he wasn't want to distrub Aran  while shooting 😂
Maybe there is hope for humanity afterall.
Another day another video, the good think about his channel is it’s not blocked on my school Chromebook because at school during work time I get headphones and sit on the very back seat and watch his vids 2 hours
can you do the lumen
Hi Just a comment on number 18. It seems that this invention is very overrated in terms of performance. It seems that it's really not very good. I'm basing myself on the video of "Bullshit ou pas ? - l'arbre à vent - Monsieur Bidouille".  I hope it will be constructive ;)
Nice showerhead but at € 200,- a piece I can already imagin the threefold added pressure of the Mrs, if I just got bonkers...
Iove it
Where can we buy fakon
You missed the hair
🖤
Nice outfit dude
Judas Iscariot
what are these lactase enzymes you speak of???
Pretty much wanted to try that Facon ...
Damn that No.1 thingy.. Imagine if those Transparent solar glasses are used in transparent mobile phone...
We’ve seen millions of inventions each year that are made to “save the world” because of climate, but at rhe end none of them are available in the market 🤔
Veggie meat can never beat real meat.
Bacon is also harm in Christianity and Judaism
You should make a video about top 20 greatest success
So the meal worm is gonna multiply itself and eat all the plastics in the world like they show some gaints in the cartoon.
Transparent solar isn't going to work, if you look at the energy distribution of Sunlight over its spectra that reaches surface then most of the energy is in visible range. So if you don't absorb visible light your efficiency drops to abysmal levels.  Before making a video you shouldn't just read some companies marketing spiel and do your own research on viability of such outrageous claims.
Says nothing bad about product 3/10 lol
1:00 nice catches! How long or how many times did you practice to master the catch?
You can't cook in a vacuum  -ActionLab
Fun Fact: We indians have been making & using these eco friendly plates for like a hundreds of centuries now 🌟
Actually more than a half of the products that you told ,I already knew about them 😑
Some of these are so dumb I have to keep reminding myself I'm not watching one of throe fail compilations
Can we just appreciate how he traveled back to ancient Rome to purchase that costume and come back to make this video
It's weird: So many big inventions now are basically just finding a use for waste products or limiting power consumption. Like even Intel said that basically the next big inventions in transistors isn't going to be smaller ones, but less energy-hungry ones. Tesla too is just trying to make cars more efficient.  But who cares, because in 2030, we're eating our mushroom packing and tableware.
Dude why you dressing like that it is shame
I love hi invention videos and he is wearing team seas hoodie ❤️❤️
Unfortunately, there's no way to truly abandon meat unless we artificially reproduce it in a lab. Meat contains proteins that Vegetables do not have unless we genetically modify them to, and even that's difficult. Humans are omnivores by nature, and ignoring nature is playing with fire.  Also that Facon likely tastes nothing like bacon, but probably tastes good as its own thing. Every vegan meat Alternative I have tried has tasted nothing like it says, but a lot of it is good as its own thing.  Also we don't need a wind powered power bank, we have solar rechargable power banks that are not only cheaper but way more viable in most situations.  Everything else on the list is pretty promising, definitely hope to see more ecologically sustainable development and inventions in the future. Especially a petrol replacement!!! We NEED a petrol alternative!
Best .. out of tech
I have 6 account  and I subscribed youuuuuuuu!
Every innovation shown here are truly amazing. If it becomes widely available globally then it'll surely help us saving our planet, though I don't expect to see envelopes made of that 🐘💩paper 😂 and doesn't putting that edible plate on the table makes it fill it germs though 🤔😷. Though veganism is the only thing that I strongly disagree with, it's full of BS I mean if killing animals really bothers you then shouldn't predator animals hunting its prey animals bothers you ? And if you let the animals grow at free will then wouldn't that make them over populate the world and harm the environment anyway ? And if you start birth controlling the animals, wouldn't that go against the animal's self will ? And science proves that plants have life , then isn't veganism also a type of killing life anyway ? 🤷🏻‍♂️ God almighty has made our digestive system capable of digesting both plant and meat , then why only depend on plants and avoid meat when we have the privilege of enjoying both ? Just live efficiently and that's enough to save the planet and live happily as HUMAN 🙂
12:14 California Girls - Lil Peep starts playing
If we are gonna stop eating meat then next generation will only see chicken and goat only in zoo 🤣🤣🤣
And why ?????
1:06 "that's what she used."
Im in an airport,I don’t think 1,000 glasses filling this 😂
Is Huel really good?
6:25 just use a bucket and a mug if you really wanna save water.And shower less bath more.
Mrwhostheboss or Arron my Xaomi Mi 11 Ultra  is overheating  can you tell me why please 🥺
Hey can I get some cloud storage 😜.
I was in the middle of trying a Huel product when the sponsored bit came up and now I'm mildly scared.
9:08 OK that's not a bright idea. JK love your videos
what are you wearing
The reason he is the best in the World
This man Rick rolled me with paper
There is a wind tree like that one just 300 meters from my apartment but i have never seen the leafs turn. Either they blocked it for some reason or there’s not enough wind power, which I think is the case. It’s surrounded by buildings…
glad to know u are supporting team seas!
A good step indeed, but we cant forget about pollutants still at hand! ALL of these should almost he ENFORCED, not just concepts.
Hi arun
Hi Arun, please don't throw the eatable fruits.,...
air ink is is so cool! :0
So many dumb ideas, goodbye
But wouldnt plastic roads be bad considering wet plastic or cold plastic is slippery
Finally, some intelligence.
Anyone else notice the girl at 8:30? hmm...wonder who it could be.....
Hi aron I saw that you put the plastic road in fourth place but a few weeks ago I saw another video that says that although the plastic road lasts much longer, but at the same time the friction of the wheels with the road wears the road and emits micro-plastics into the environment Really love your videos ❤
Please answer my question , should i exchange my OnePlus 7t pro(256gb) for a brand new Realme gt master edition(256gb) ???
Where is the link for the Huel product? :)
PLEASE tell me the brand of Facon used in this video., It's never mentioned in video or linked in description... Help!
Arun you've come a long way brother. I really love your content and the thought and dedication you and your crew puts into these videos. Keep making awesome content like this my man.♥️♥️
Arun please write down the websites of every company in the video
I really like the wind trees. Seems like something anyone could have in their backyard.
6:12 “It would likely fill up every inch of space you’re in” Me outside: 🤨
ZA WARUDO, TOKI WO TOMARE...
I'm just here to appreciate the amount of time and research done by Arun to produce this.
Littreally 2 things that can change everything...
I'm sorry but the no. 1 is so stupid idea :D infra red light, even though we can't see it, give us heat.. the same goes with UV light which our body needs to create vitamin D.
Coming home to your wife after a day of boiling shit 😷
11:27 Pavegen, No. 5 and  rating 8/10  Thunderf00t :  "do you even science !?"
I like ur videos but this time It's a symbolic custume you should concern about it not appreciated hope you understand better luck next time 👍
The company promate already made paper from poop years ago
Definitely wouldn't stop eating meat. Pork and beef and two of the greatest foods on this planet. Great video though. It's great to see how much you love the earth
it is a pleasure to see that most of the inventions are made by indians :))
Honestly I’d gladly pay for plastic roads have seen residential roads in Ohio holes everywhere
Ad 😒
Mrwhosethejesus
I think airink is a bs
gonna just say a taste plate you can use in the oven is nice
Get him to ten million plsss
You should watch the Arab man cook dinner using a mirror cooker
These videos revive my faith in humanity 🥰
Friendly reminder: climate change is not your fault, most of it is caused by large companies. Vote to hold them responsible
Its refreshing to see Arun showing so much enthusiasm towards bio-friendly clean energy. He genuinely loves the inventions and enjoys ranting about them.
Your dress look funny
we turn cow skin into leather to not waste anything of the cow we turn into steak.
Now thats an outfit straight outa the Gospel
I love the ideas you share. Many I would not be able to use because I am in a wheelchair. I would love to see you offer some ideas that would work for wheelchair users.
how is he not at 10 million yet
Im starting to believe that this man is the god of puns
the title shouldve been
the solar panel NEEDED a 10/10
this is what we need
This video let me down . Impractical ideas or may be for rich
This is indeed one of the greatest video on your channel
the name huel black edition sounds so racist
Love ur all videos keep doing brother! Ur interesting videos are new tech and tech fails keep doing this❤️
I wont switch to vegan cause iam bodybuilder and god didnt make animal  to care about them hé make them to be food 👍
Mrs Clarissa is legit and her method works like magic I keep on earning every single week with her new strategy
Yeah no im not gonna abandon meat any time soon...
His suits watching this be like: *Am I a joke to you?*
mrwhosetheboss again osessed with rick roll
Since we all live in capitalism none of these cool ideas will hold, if they are not cost efficent to itself or its competitors. Next time it would be awesome if you show ideas who are also very cheap or simple to implement.
Id love to do research for the "Transparent laser", a new goal to accomplish 😃
Everything is 10/10! 👌
the shower heads are so expensive. A similar technology should be made more easily available to the general population, not too many people would be willing to spend £120-350 for a shower head lol
16:50  "...Shaken, not stirred"  😂😂😂 good and fun videos... thx man.
:0
You look like julius ceasar dude
Can I point out almonds does more environmental damage the  cows
this thumbnail just brightened my 2022
Cloud storage XD
If all billionaire buys these gadgets then imagine the earth 💫
10:55 I see what you did there... :D Keeping in mind that most plates can't be eaten, you're not putting that statement with very high bar :D
Thanks for calling out all lactose intolerant people.
Him: 21 ways we can save the earth. Also him: give huel a try. I'm not trying to send any hate.
Those new solar panels are going to be revolutionary. With cars having to go full electric one day, imagine a self sustainable fully electric car thats charged by its windows 😱
Please include bacon meter in the rest of your videos
what do you think that thr mealwurm poo out
Cant find the huel link?
So solar panels contain very toxic chemicals, they last for max 20 years and then...
I love mealworms but won't them eating plastic make the animals who eat them like birds and frogs sick?
What on Earth is "algee?" I guess he means "algae."
Just need to downvote for the plastic roads being high praised. It's an even worse idea than "glassphalt" (asphalt with glash shards in it). Plastic roadways has so many issues that make it just poorly compete with existing roadways without really being any cleaner to make than existing roadways.
3:33 Its not a plant, it is a micro-organism.
1 John 2 15 17 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions—is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.
This vid might not even change the environment and restores trust but also makes everything useful
Going 🔟MILLION....💥💥💥💫💫💫💫
When the thumbnail is very true ❤️.
Whoever is reading this, stay blessed… big things are coming your way.
The word shit gets you demonetised but not poo lmao.
5:14 this is so stupid and idiotic like bro when u kill a old cow for its meat ( fuck vegan food im talkin real meat ) and then what u wanna do with its skin!? Throw it away like a garbage!? No make leather
So MR Beast is scamming us 🤨, he charged us 1$ per tree where they actually cost 50 cents?
This is probably one of the best videos you’ve ever posted.  Our planet is the only one we have. We should take care of it.
4:34 L
You're the best tech youtuber in the world according to me🖤
A sub to the channel will be SERAPHIC,  would have been more convincing.
Vegan leather won’t last as long as original leather and vegan leather will lose its coating and gloss overtime plus it has a weird texture to it ….and it does not have a premium feeling to it ,I know this cuz we r in the leather industry
Clearly the ranking is not connected to the environmental goodness overall
Your smile of passion for the videos you make is one of the many reasons I watch your videos
90% of these will fail
9:12 19:12
It is one of the best videos on your channel.
Now realise that almost none of these inventions will scale up and get depressed again.
Great episode, please make more of them love these topics. Can you also make commercially available inventions like these ?
Eco plate not using plastic…wait its wrapped in plastic
I just love how he's like "this invention is so cool! 3/10."
I will like number 3 idea if it wasn't a f****** worm
7 :24  rickrolled again. 😂
Huel is good but Ka'chava is greater and better tasting. 😁😊🥰😁
Faith in Humanity restored
True Godly in this entire video is his Robe 🤣❤️
6:21: Yeah, by not having one :p
Put this stuff all over the world and boom earth saved
Why is he educative, informative yet funny at the same time?
Hey do review on new vivo iQoo9 pro plsss
Thats a holy costume 😆
Great videos quality, but when you apply critical thinking to some of those products You will realise that they are not so eco friendly. Ecology is not so easy topic
Nice sunday service  🙌
One could even say that these inventions are Made In Hebun...…
This is one of the best videos on YouTube. I'm tired of the negativity and things that are fed to us everyday. THIS is why I'm in tech. To make the world better, and simpler for most people. The creativity of some of these is astounding. We need more of this.
Am I the only one who saw a smiling lady's head being added into the video at 8.28??? The more important question is... who is she???
does anyone else feel the urge to didge current sivilisation and go live in caves again?
I'm proud that a Filipino🇵🇭 product is here the pinatex number 13 I have no idea that they did that until now when I see it as part of The DOLE project, so to say.... Very proud
Sir. Mrwhosetheboss can you help find a job there i u.k.
Didn't thunderf00t have a video on plastic roads?
This might be one of my most favorite Aron’s video ever. The planet is dying, and we need something like this to help revive it.
No more spitballs in high school if poo paper becomes popular
Before he was giving us ideas to make life easier  Now he is giving us ideas to save the planet Good job arun and keep up the good work 😁
6:47 That’s what she said
this will probhably be vegan teachers favourite vid 😂
I can't stop laughing with the theme of this videos haha🤣
Fr, I thought that number 13 was VEGAN TEACHER
Edible straws,metal straws and silicone straw are all great for our planet Sadly the edible plate isn’t good if you can’t have gluten
Watching this ons in a tablet dont own a phone  Im just broke
gotta love the bacon-meter
Great video! Thanks a lot for highlighting these sustainable products. Much need for this in the tech space!
you are just great :)
"A natural friendly video"
10:09 Is that plastic wrap? Oh, the irony...
he is from beta house  american pie 😂
Joe Mama
beautiful
This video helps you look at the bright side of technological advancement. We always think technology is harming our planet but it can also save it. This  is a big hope for humanity. Cheers!!
the real Jesus revealed
Do a *GAMING THEME* next!!   :)
Why is this guy dressed like a god ?
Ok enough now we want a house tour
the music when introducing the transparent solar *chef's kiss*
I think this is a sad video. sure the ideas are commendable ! but some of these products are just bullshit ....
the music when introducing the transparent solar *chef's kiss*
Dude, you are not even American. Why would you use Gallon as a unit of measurement and not even mention how much is that in Litres? I am not angry, just confused.
Sub now :)
Hey Arun, I think some of these inventions are revolutionary so I think it would be cool if you made videos where we are updated on these techs. Thanks.
Can you also include metric units? As a fellow European, I have no idea what a so called gallon is. Had to se Google Assistant to have it converted.
i always wonder how ur neighbours must be feeling while watching you dressed up and doing random things that a matured men is nor supposed to do.... please make some behind the scene videos
These techs are really cool and all but we saw time and time again that this ecomodernist approach is pretty much a capitalist lie.  Unfortunately it's just a fact that the economy cannot grow and grow without end while we have finite resources. We cannot go on about our life as usual while expecting techonology to solve every problem we have. E.g. the carbon footprint of the most eco-aware 1st world countries per capita are much higher then a third word country's whos using coal plants and not caring about recycling and such, simply because the third world country is on a lower level of growth.  So while using and developing these eco-friendly technologies are really good, it's deceiving and dangerous to say that the  problems caused by mankind can be all fixed with just these without degrowth and maintaining  exponential GDP growth.
7:09 you gotta be kidding me🤣💔🔥
I am sorry to tell you but many of this innovation resolve a problem that didn't exist and are worst than some existing solution. For example : vegan leather generate more CO2 than cow leather (cow who live outside). A cow eat grass (a field who can grow crops is not the same type than a field of grass and can't be convert to a crop field) A cow drink non drinkable water (drink in a river or any water on the ground). That means that cow don't generate C02 by drinking and eating. Cow generate methane by digestive system. It s the exact same amount of methane than if the grass wasn't eaten and lay on the ground. Cow generate fertilizer on the ground and it s great for the grass and can be use to help grow crops. Cow are responsible of CO2 emissions only if they live inside. Cow CO2 emissions exist only because of a way of grow cow. Vegan leather use crops or any material that use more gaz or energy to produce. Sorry for my english
Looks like boss dude is going for some Shakespeare's play😅
Whatever mess we humans make Jesus Christ has a solution eg. Meal worms, transparent solar panel's power source etc. Praises to Jesus Christ
Utube god guys fr. Big up to Arun
Trees  are growing like matrix 😎  Technology  is taking  over these heavenly gadgets in future will be the sun 🌞 and Arun will be the boss
That ink pen made from air pollution has to in your top 3,  1 it saves the planet  2 saves on the cost of making a real men  3 we're recycling emissions
u sussy little baka :)
You look so happy and it seems that you enjoy making videos so much wich just adds to the amazing quality. Been a sub for a long long time, and to see your progression from 200k its astonishing.
Arun looks like a discount Hadrian in this outfit 😭
Team seas yay your in
Watching This Vedio To Improve Our English Listening Skills 😅😅😅
These inventions actually restored my faith in humanity
some of those inventions could end up fixing a lot of issues.  If the top 5 are all achievable and used properly, many of the issues in the would could be solved.  Now, we need a magic cure for some of the stupidity out there...
The Huel link doesn’t work :(  Really want you to get the commission
How cute is he in that costume!! Great video. Thank you.
Like it
The last one tho
Thank you for this informative video! peace
You are way too close to 9.69 million subscribers Arun !
4:09 can see that "that's what" right beside his head 😂
6:47 lmao 😂😂
I like how Arun is making more and more environmentally conscious videos and trying influence people in a techy way
Plastic roads seems like a really shitty idea. You are just making a shit ton of microplastics to the enviroment when cars run on top of them
So the shower head just makes water must thst you shower in
If you want more 🌴. Add more Carbon into the atmosphere 😂
Just a shame people can't stop being so selfish and think about pain and suffering of animals for a pointless sandwich! Would sort out most of our troubles.
God Messanger 😇🙏
Okay but wtf happened to your clothes
9:22 €50000 only
9:19 one of the cheapest house.. Wow
That Bacon countdown timer 🤣
Who is taking 25 minute showers?
Banana leaf is better
You should know, all these inventions are made for the plebians, not for the ruling classes. They tell you, the meat you eat, the straw you use and your very existence is causing the planet to die. LMAO.
the puns are so terrible they are great. keep up the good work 😀
Nice shoulders!
Why was Rick Astley on the poo paper
THIS IS WHAT WE NEED. TQ ARUN
This is big brain stuff..
If only world could be like this.
Plastic road has already been debunked ... The idea is better than the execution ... Plastic road would need an actual road to support it ...
All is well but what’s with your dress 🤪
Wosam thumbnail 👍
Solid sheesh
What's the bag from Huel made of?
This guy made me feel like his add/sponsor  was part of his list in his video.
i love   how the bacon icon gradually turns red at the bottom right of the video as the real bacon is being cooked !!
The last one seems like a physics lecture.
that barbeque clip 😁
Awesome video
Try doing a deeper research into the so-called “plant-based crap and see how many hormones and GMO are in there
Facon reminds me of the very first episode of Breaking Bad
So you’ve bought the global warming climate change hoax Arun
6:47 thats what she said.......
Do some productive why in all video you just sit on same place go walk man
his video was pretty good, until he used team seas hoodie for a sponsership video, it's like adding the trust of team seas to add. Which I don't appreciate. Yeah the whole point of this video about saving earth, but you could either make the whole video(including ad) with that hoodie or just couldn't not wear it all. Okay you paid for that. You can wear it, but don't you think it wouldn't be so moral to wear a eco-friendly movement merch to a sponsership video ??
the last 3 are simply amazing
Is nobody going to tlk about rict astely on pper
The main problem with the transparent solar panels is that their efficiency is under 1%. Which is pretty bad, but because you can use them on an entire skyscraper might actually be viable.
MrZuesTheBoss*
Making a video full of saving the planet and on it he just throws a pineapple to ground  Well done mahn
Wow
Rickroll?
Me watching this from the shower
we indians don't use shower we use bucket for bathing
Everyone who has suddenly gotten a positive outlook for the future after watching this video just remember that it's your responsibility to push your respective governments and administrations into adopting these technologies and coming up with policies that are in line with the environment.
I'm just surprised he forgot to add a "that's what she said when he said"...."Just thinking about it makes me wet"
I just came down to the comment section to see how they roasted Arun's costume
Hi-Tec Mr beast
Good video. At the same time, I think of all the products that would become obsolete if we were more responsible with procreation. Thanos was thinking too small. *snap*
The only thing that interest me is the wheat bran plates
Good video. At the same time, I think of all the products that would become obsolete if we were more responsible with procreation. Thanos was thinking too small. *snap*
Smartphone companies also use these transperant Solar Panel as a display to charge itself battery 🔋
Bruh if you don’t like bbq then just use an oven
I noticed a scratch in his left hand 🥺
Getting Rick rolled by a poo paper :)
10:12 Wheat bran plates to replace the ceramic and plastic kitchenware comes in plastic packing how ironic!
Use my comment as a dislike button 🔘🔘
Ha Ha Ha. Super Nice Double Catch (1 Min. Mark).
Commenting for reach
Plastic roads aren't viable, they aren't hard enough and will get worn down in no time at all
Really nice shower head, too bad it costs 770 bucks, looking forward to the price reduction in the future.
That dress just looks cool on Arun
As always 🔥👍🏼👍🏼👌🏼
15:16 I've heard that somewhere
7:23 don't elephants consume trees though.... If this industry get bigger, won't it just cause more trees to be cut to feed all the elephants and make them poo more, you can't poo without eating.
Great concepts or inventions but you should also mention the price for each of these products.
Some dude my country made gin out of elephant dung. 😅
Wait with the Xiaomi packaging doesn't that mean ppl can turn boxes into shrooms?
NUMBER 11 WAS INTRIGUING . I HAVE VISITED THAT FACTORY . IT IS IN SRI LANKA. WHEN YOU ENTER IT IS A BIT SMELLY BUT IT IS FOR A GOOD CAUSE .
MrBeast rn : 👁👁                            👄
Banger video 🔥🔥🔥
1:01 can we all just talk about how smooth that catch is while still explaining what SoapBottle is?
The algea buildings are great and all, but I dont trust humans not to break the walls.
Won't algae smell as hell🤢
This is the best video I have ever watched
Nobody seems to mention the plates wrapped in plastic 😅
does vegan leather smell as strong as real leather tho lol
Aren't divine and godly basically the same....
a pavegen like tech exists all over japanese subways and has been since a long time
Vegan bacon 😆
Did someone notice the plastic cover on the wheat plates at number 7, 10:12
You Rickrolled Us ;,)
Superb video.. 100% informative ☺️👍🏻
I just couldn't take him seriously throughout the whole video cause of his outfit ahahaha
Plastic roads are a perfect example of using our biggest problems to our biggest advantage.
Bro why don't ppl ever use these inventions
I am  glad your tech topics are about sustainability as well, that puts you ahead of mkbhd massively 😉
Future seems bright.     Kind of 👀
love your videos
Ngl I've heard about the mealworms 5 years back. Don't know how far they've come
Nice outfit Mrwhosetheboss
The moment we get out of this Virtual world which Content Creaters like ARUN ❤️ make it look so beautiful, everything seems the same mess World 🌍 but i hope people will start implementing all these information on their own rather than waiting for such things to happen as a Hope. Thanks Man ❤️ enjoyed a lot !
MrWhoseTheJEWS 🤣🙏🏻
Him: I can’t stress how cool this is  3/10 😂 the video is awesome though
atomised water shuld cool down faster?
Being poor automatically solves almost 90% of these climate change problems.😅
I love this man's creativity  😅
Still Gonna Eat My Nice Fresh Bacon Straight From The Store From The Pig  But Facon Isn't A Bad Idea Don't Get Me Wrong.
9:11 that’s not a bright idea
SO NOT HALAL MODE BACON FOR SHITTY PEOPLE
But isn't plastic road slippery, when it rains.
Or parents that don’t leave
I love the idea of transparent solar panels on everything, but, let's face it;  the oil industry is going to do everything they can to kill it.
Bro... Oneplus 10 pro where?
I take 5-minute long showers, with a longest of 12 minutes. Who on earth showers for a full half-hour.
Rick rolled again
After talking all about eco friendly invrntions and products, ends the video with a sponsored product that is packed in a giant black plastic bag and a plastic bottle. Great Work!
That is why we Indians us bucket and a mug
The first one (making clothes with recyclable plastic from the oceans) was proven to be not as they say it is They get very little amount from the oceans, most of the plastic they use don't come from the oceans at all
Can i assume that Arun wearing a toga is a reference to Toga from My Hero Academia?!
Man I gotta say i live your content, you're so creative and entertaining.
actually pretty dang cool stuff
Bio🔥+tech+❤️ + Him😍
only one negative bro don't waste food ( pineapple ) 😍 u r videos are good 🤗😇
This vid is like a 'must-buy wishlist' when I have the money lol
I love this series so much. I love seeing cool tech. Never stop.
Like always, that amazing things that can help us and the world won't came to life because how our society are: power and money. If some ideas solve almost all the problem then powerful people won't like the idea if they aren't making money with that idea and I can predict that almost all great ideas are very spencive and a lot of us are poor people(thanks for our gouvernements that worries too much for us). Always the bad, toxic, contaminated, ideas that make money to the powerful people came to life, no matter how much they want to hide it(removing chargers for phones), if not why mcdonalds are still favorite for most people? The big true is that nature and technology won't like each other, they are the opposite, you can't do no harm nature if you create technology, always when create tech harm nature. hope with my terrible english understand my toughts.
Looking forward for these items to be more common! I will differently get one if these items!
Leather and fur is actually also good and environmentally friendly if sourced and produced responsibly. Plus, it's recyclable, unlike plastic faux leather and fur.
Just imagine if one of these things you need up in his tech fails vid
“21 Heavenly inventions that will restore your faith in humanity” Now let’s not get ahead of ourselves here… that’s gonna take more than some above average products
He's so creative, sometimes I thought to myself. If I had everything I need just to explain the need. Than maybe boredom would be a issue, many many many many many people are thinking their happy with their small phones yes it's true I once was and still I am but I could have done .. the best or at least near best to make people appreciate creativity. . At least that way 🤦 . People can really choose. Slow progress and fast learning 💆.  But the issue is Identity, negative  reactions and misunderstanding of the concepts of happiness and languages. It something takes time, it needs to be done more brilliantly. I believe turning off something is not the end, of they can overcome the fears with the appropriate way of learning, it can basically help anybody.  🌐 Knowledge shouldn't be always available 🤦  .
Hell themed
milo cant handle any more😂😅
Huel is packaged in plastic though...🌝
Still my favorite YT tech creator. It’s not all information. He’s really spunky and funny. Well done 😌
Ok so appropriate that the French made this BUT can we talk about how the wind tree looks like it has a bunch of butt plugs on it for leaves
Yo Astrix Arun😁😁
Looks like Jesus but just stole some tech stuff from Earth
Imagine having a party with the wheat plate... Then you start eating the plates in front of your friends
Nice outfit🤣🤣🤣🤣
So You Are Telling Me Plastic Is Bad And You Are Wearing A Plastic Leave Bandana On Your Head?
Just came here for his costume
Arun the 13 Olympian  God of Tech
Recycled plastic clothes sound great until you realise they shed microplastics into the water and if they're thrown out, they end up in landfills and are not going to break down
why you cook a beacon that not meat? why not just eat it ? it's a vegetable
Dont throw food away you idiot,a great video though
Damn I really want an ecocapsule now
10 MIL CLOSE AF!!!!! LETS GOOOO
5:51 interview at Nebia Moen:  Person 1: So, what should we call our product? Person 2: no clue, but I need to use my deodorant now, brb...  *Some time later*  Person 1: wait a second, what's the name of your deodorant? Person 2: Nivia Men Person 1: perfect, let's name it Nivia Men, but with a twist to avoid lawsuits
Your rating on the misting shower is wrong per se. when you mist water it actually gets colder. So you need hotter water to stay warm.
Organic photovoltaics
Your best video so far bro, i Hope you will do more of this great pro impact environment videos, they are so important
The only major problem with the plastic roads at this time is that, especially highways, they need to turn nicely and be able to have constant pressure no matter the circumstances, plus the nice thing about asphalt is that when bits fall off, they are just rocks and can be easily filled, however the plastic roads would be very useful for sidewalks as we don’t weigh enough to break off bits of it making it extremely viable
Let’s change corporations habits for the biggest changes. Great video
you forgot to put teamseas link in the description man
So amazing, so much better than all those other "top 10 tech inventions" channels
9:20 "JUST!" JUUUST?!?!?!? lol
great video about inventions that solve issues that are invented for fearmongering in the first place...
great vdo
*Fascinating* 🌝
4:01 CHA TIME😳😳
WOW
8:27 We love Barbeques like these lmao 🤣
Most of these “inventions” have been concepts since I started reading Popular Science in the 90’s. And they’re still not in production. But I bet they’re making some people a ton of money though!
You're definitely treading in deep waters here. Introducing religion into anything that doesn't involve religion is never a good idea. Careful, Arun.
So cool!
I can’t keep up with all this it’s about too boorish, had high hopes, I hope you’ll do better next time, just so you know the quality of your videos have been degraded drastically.
Hey aaron,You shop so many different types of phones to show us that these type of phones really exist   Thats really cool! Though But what do u do with those phones after the completion of youtube video
1:00 dangggggg those catches were smoooth... how many takes did that take? 😂
A lot of stuff seems impractical
everybody try to make comedy but you directly hit the topic
I'm sure no one noticed "that's what" and that evil smile at 4.09😆
7:29  Who thought of that
This Video has so many New Startup Ideas that can make thousand people millionaires in coming 10-20 years !! Yes, NFT is bubble, Savers of Planet gonna rock the NextGen
The hope Is back
That outfit you’re wearing lol.  Great video once again.
love your videos there so good!
i think you forget to keep the link of huel....!!!!!
1.1m
Eren Jeager: Did you say Humanity??
👍👍👍👍
Who designed your costumes today?
best video ever
The effort that goes into these videos is just mind blowing! Hats off to you and your team 👏🏻
The theme HEAVENLY made me so eager to watch it and true heavenly indeed 😁
Excellent video! The footpath thing was my idea years ago though! Damn! Should have patented it! Doh!
this is why i like this youtuber
Use huel
Dude yo gotta stop with the cringy jokes!!
Have you ever Unboxed xiaomi mi mix alpha.
Ur also have ink-redible
At 8:28 arun looking as my dream Girl.  This would be.................................................Crazy  (Just kidding) don't be serious
U can also make leather from mango 🙂😉
Thank you for giving us insight on what's to come
i luv u bro not like that but i luv what u are doing
best video ever ❤️❤️❤️
This will be my one of the best videos that I hv ever seen.
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
🔥💣
If anyone's wondering when did he Rick roll 7:30
I really love this kind of videos 💞💞
7:23 the paper he is holding has an image of Rick Astley he rickrolled us again
I made 6 figures last year in profit from index funds and ETFs alone. It’s simple people, stop over thinking it: buy and hold good index funds/ETFs with low fees and stay consistent. Millionaire I’m no time 💰💰🙌🚀
Great
7:08 why..
Fact no 12 . Why don't use an bucket instead of shower it saves a lot of water and it even feels good
One drone could plant that many trees if it weren't charging   It's battery every 45 minutes..
Its so soothing and relaxing to hear that somebody is trying to save the planet, and we are ready to give our own little contribution...
I Subscribe to his channel everytime I watch his videos.
This video gave me hope for humanity. A suggestion: a video that follows up on how some of these inventions are going a year or two after you talk about them, to see if they are here for the long haul!
So if Mealworms are like humans digesting milk how about the 10% of mealworms that cant digest plastic?
Everything just is better and even perfect... From the theme, message and the overall script ... I love that Arun has come this far.... Keep it up bro... Always informative. :-)
Incredible fit
Amazing video, incredible execution, and fantastic editing
And cost effectively makes all this shit in weirdos toys or actual scam.
10:42  I am addied addied up I just ate a plate for breakfast                                               - The Weeknd
jesus is indain lmao
I can sense the pain of being short of 1 to make it 22😂😅
I Love You!… he he he he lmao
No offense, but plastic road cause more pollution than asphalt road, as the friction between tires and road cause more plastic parts per million of plastic. It should be above no. 10 not at 4
Super research!
i've seen Pavegen at a mercedes us open before.......11:58  it's feels pretty weird to step on tho
Literally half of these inventions are scams you fell for.
your dump truck could save humanity
I would love, him to be my science teacher..😁. He’s better than the one I had 🤷🏻‍♀️
He said 21 toxic tech fails. there were 19 lol 😅
That transparent solar panel tho, clearly a genius idea and we all need to support it so the economic value can reach all countries.
What is the price for all of these invention? Is it cheap? If these invention can only be use by the 1% then then it better to keep destroying earth
Super interesting!
Today's video is sponsored by plastic
Can we just say,oxygenate, instead of purify?🙂👍
Why you dressed up like a girl?
A lot of these things are all flash and very little real benefit. Green washed marketing projects.
😂⚡⚡❤️
Thanks boss. It did increase my hope in humanity and our future.
Okay but the number one thing on the list is actually incredibly unfeasible.  First off, our current best solar panels are already horribly inefficient, so removing the capacity to harness visible light only reduces the efficiency. Secondly, if they are absorbing everything outside of the visible light spectrum, then cell service inside any building containing these windows is going to be absolutely horrendous. Definitely a poor choice for the number 1 slot.
Bro how much time did you take to make this video
I do not trust that bacon, no sir.
Why is he dressed like that?
Why does the biodegradable box get a 4 out of 10
I appreciate this vaporware preview
Everything here is actually useful, I want a future where these are international products everyone uses!
Im obsessed and CAPTIVATED with every video you put out. So glad I discovered your channel
I actually wish Moss gardens would be popular. They are one of the most incredible plants to me.
Why not put number 5 into where car goes
Vegan products is the best
Broownn curry fuck shiiit
U make my day ❤️
He can deafaet cororna 😂😂
4:09 i saw that 👀
Vegan leather is a disaster, don't buy. It's just PR bullshit
Awesome content boss
The box from Xiaomi probably contained mi 12 series I'm super hyped for it
Really brother..just joss..so good
Now, if we could just get cigarette companies to make biodegradable filters.
❤️❤️❤️
Arun pls do a video of Xiaomi 11i Series Hypercharge
Who can save the planet when we do not help our most vulnerable, who make up the majority? over 50% of the planet is considered "low income". These products are insane prices at retail so if wealthy people do not support them and/or invest then no way will any low income households be able to do anything but buy what is cheapest and that sadly is the most toxic crap out. Wealth inequality is very real but because of classism not people being lazy.. The ones that do have, do not want to lose anything to those who do not.
YES 14:34
weak 7:14
Nice Lalo ung top1, 14:49 looking forward to all of this invention to improve more
All cool untill the mealworms break out from the lab and start eating celebrities faces
Everything just is better and even perfect... From the theme, message and the overall script ... I love that Arun has come this far.... Keep it up bro... Always informative. :-)
this video is legitimately giving me hope for the future.
Poo paper is an old very old concept
YOUTUBE has JUMPED THE SHARK
most of these inventions are are not sustainable.
I thought the costume was just for intro. Nope. Whole video. Damn
I hate bacon but not as much as I hate fake bacon or any vegan wannabe “meat”. Imagine how much of a hypocrites the vegans are when trying to convince us to eat “vegan meat/bacon/whatever” If you’re a vegan you shouldn’t promote your shit calling it “vegan meat” since it defeats the purpose 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ if you claim to be a vegan than stick to vegetables, don’t try to get us eating shitfuckery “vegan meat” or better said shitfuckery that you hope/make to taste like meat since meat shouldn’t be in a vegans vocabulary because obvious reasons 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️, that’s when you lost me a sub from me at least 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I totally agree that going vegan would help the environment. But there's something a lot of people forget while saying that: world hunger. We humans in our current state, whilst eating meat AND plants, can't even sustain the entire world with food. Sure, lots of food goes to waste, but it is undeniable. Now imagine a world WITHOUT the meat. World hunger would get so much worse to the point that some countries could just die out
Arun you are amazing 🔥
Done🔥🔥
I think that you are wrong on the leather one. The skin of a cow is also a byproduct. Real leather is gathered from cows that are going to be killed anyways for meat, so that also reduces waste. Also, vegan leather is a complete knock off of real leather. The quality is not even comparable. It can burn, and the polishing of the vegan leather can chip away.
why only 21? its 2022
7:09    No one gonna talk bout poor Rick?
This video adds real value man!
you forgot the huel link in the description
who is here after watching tech burners video
Anyone notice the "that's what" at 4:09?
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. These are the kind of "solutions" that ALWAYS  turn out out to be bullshit.
Great digging made by Arun again.
First of all, It was mind-blowing and second, I love the outfit👼😇
The sponsor whose packaging is made of plastic sponsored to save plastic
When it comes to the trees. The type of trees does matter.
ok , i get vegans you can do you. but not every one needs to be we gotta kill the animals. they would over populate
Mr whose the boss, excuse me. The people who take down trees for paper. They plant back by the least 99.98% of all trees. Because there business model forces them to. You know that guy from the Lorax that cut down trees for that product? He failed because… guess what.. he didn’t replant trees! Still however, that 0.02% of trees number in the thousands.
Excellent Arun 💜 One of the most informative video 😇
Aaron to his wardrobe of costumes, "Where's that gift from zeus on my visit to Olympus?!"
Just 50,000 euros
"I'm feeling wet just thinking about it" 💀
Where's the huel link 🔗 ??
Solar-glass:Blocks ligth we can't see Wifi and other wireless things:gonna run around and dessert you
how to start a Morning? See Arun dressed as Greek God and listen to him about saving the World
that shower head is literally just a mister... no. good luck rinsing your hair with a misting of water
I visited the place where they make the poo paper a while back, and I still have the book that I decorated from there.
Sponsor link not working
Arun is seriously embracing his other side 🙂
Ecocapsule is illegal in Colorado
anyone else notice the bran plates were wrapped in plastic?
I’m going to take shorter showers now
seem i don't like the Mealworms as much as the other plastic waste initiatives. that's because: i like the idea of reusing all this plastic to make fibers, pavement, etc, rather than completely breaking it down. it seems like such a waste. everything else was great.
I love that he puts timers for each part. Every YouTube should do this. Great video!
6:47
As amazing as many of these sound, I unfortunately doubt many of them will be put into motion soon since they will get rid of many problems that make many people money right now.
‘Punny’ god
You can keep your vegan world for yourself.
1:05  (Stares at pink bottle) It's not mine, I promise!  Me: Why are you so defencive? We weren't goinf to judge!
I feel like the wheat bran plate isn’t so much of a good idea… It needs more solidity… How can I trust that something I can bite be solid enough to use a knife?
Yall this is reaallyyyyyy cool
i swear this man goes to online shopping and searches clothing and somehow sorts by uniqueness and makes a video based on the clothes
The power tree, reminds me of the scenario in the movie the lorax, pretty soon trees won't want to grow anymore and those power ones will be what we consider 'real trees'
Man! Those god damn paper straws are beyond annoying. You go to McDonald's and have to  drink as fast as possible or your straw crumbles in on itself 🤦🏼
I love technology more when it's about saving the planet 😍
Damn! I really like that jacket colourway 😲 Now I'm off to have a browse 👌🏼
I'd say they're all 10/10
When you watch this not because you care about humanity but just to entertain yourself
Inkredible.
Well... there is a down side to wheat plates. Because... I CANT USE IT. I HAVE CELEAC SO I CANT EAT GLUTEN OR WHEAT. So tbh there is a problem. (: And also even if I just touch gluten like wheat, then I touch my face, it will still infected me.
Ohh shit when he said a nice 25 min shower is 1000 cups of hot water ….. me who takes a 1-2 hour hot shower  :o
Hey the 1st(21) one should join Them Seas! So all the water will be plastic FREE!
You outfit is hilarious 😂
Did anyone see Rick Ashly???
#21....shouldnt even be on the list, nylon has existed for ages, nylon is plastic fiber. weve been recycling bottles into nylon since recycling has been an everyday thing, so like 30+ years now
Ok I m definitely buying those plates to try
there is chattime in UK?
Arun got the Drip of gods
🤣🤣 heavenly
Tech Jesus
my name name is Joanna and when he pronounced it Johnna i started smiling (i get that it’s german loi)
You are crazy Dude! Next level Content 💯 ❤
Awesome 👌👍😇
What happened to your clothes, bruh😂
Really Cool and Sustainable Stuff  👏
Wow Aron. U look like the real Emperor of Rome
With the number of subscribers you have, I'm so thrilled to know that how many people are going to get to know about such marvellous environment friendly technologies and inventions 🙂
6455th commentor here
I think I just saw a god
Arun putting the shirt in his "cloud storage" made me lol The cleverest joke he's done yet
50,000 euros is almost 42lakhs when converted to inr. U can build a cheap affordable house in just 6000euros
how are mealworms not 10/10 territory??
I love it when he posts
MISTERWHOSETHEGOD
what about recycled plastic home and apartment floors or walls
Let me guess. Ancient Egyptian Midwife costume?
I'm sry but that "bacon" is a crime
6:47  Caesar says "I'm feel wet just thinking about it".      🤨     Thanks for the mental image. 12:17 Where do you think all the wear particles (microplastics) of that plastic pavement will go?   Down the stormwater drain and into the ocean.  And you awarded this idea as #4 ?!     Wow, what a genius.   👏 What a sad video by someone who knows nothing about physics or science.  It was a facepalm fest all the way.
plastic roads are bad because years after it starts degrading micro plastic gets in the environment and ocean.
Hey Arun! Is it a milestone that you have a ratio of 100k likes to Zero Dislikes???
Wheat Bran plates: "There's no downside." Celiac sufferers: **EXPLODE**
Its not a mistake, ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
You did climb the tree. Quite funny. With love from Uganda here.
Shouldnt it be glorious, then divine, then godly? 🤔
2022 starts different
As someone who has both mealworms and superworms in their bedroom to feed their reptiles, I can tell you that superworms might work better than mealworms! 2 Superworms will chew a hole in plastic withing a mater of 30 minutes. I've never had a mealworm chew through plastic though
Is that a fucking bacon, excuse me, *Facon* timer in the corner shaped like a piece of ba, damnit, Facon?   I love it.
The poo paper thing originally started in srilanka , proud of my country 🇱🇰 🇱🇰
Now...Vegan teacher is gonna make a good vid for Arun
This is literally the first thing I've seen all day that adds hope instead of eroding it. Thank you!!!
the only reason he didn't wear a set of wings is because the lg phone didn't become a thing
Kool
Oh and I'm checking out Huel seems really cool for energy for hard brute work
Number 5 does not work
Here he goes again peddling Xiaomi!
I just watched 17 minutes of adds and loved it
OK
How do you speak so fast for long
Praise Jesus, Techs Are Not Bad at all!
Half of this won’t come to pass on the mass market… why? Corporations and corruption. You think the big shots at oil and electric aren’t suppressing this stuff in many nations? We would have a lot of this stuff alrdy if it weren’t for that.
Trying to be a little controversial in this one 😂
Is that Ethiopian costume(cultural clothe)

Who tf showers 25 min.
Nice shoulder mr boss 🤣🤣🤣
I love Arun's videos, he keeps them so intriguing and entertaining with the vibe that he puts out into the videos. Keep up the great work. Another banger of a video 😁
I've showered for 2 hours before
If no one in the future buys these god will take them to heaven
Capitalism isn’t going to save us from capitalism
Everybody watching godly techs Me watching godly Arun✌️😍
Plastics such a problem. Shows a plastic tree 10 secs later. WELL PLAYED
Bruh why he pronounce algae like thattt
Who else imagined edible plates when they were younger???
that's certainly an interesting wardrobe decision
I'm still watching this video but I can't get over of his costume 😂😂
Why all the ads are same in this video....and without skip too it is 20 seconds also 😡😡
The amount of ads in this video 💀
The thumbnail dude.... 😂 Great work 👍👍
The fake leather needs something like Kevlar to last as long as real leather, though.
Plastic Road is fucking stupid anywhere where it can melt lmao
I once watched a show and a couple the characters decided to make edible spoons at some point the edible plate remind me of this
Great video, but Huel? 😑
I hope next time he does hellish fails next time
This theme is so cool
He's wearing Team Seas Tshirt while sponcering Huel
"Put this in my cloud storage", wise man once said
Soooooo the air ink pen, it captures pollution and makes it into ink right?     So bassicly you HAVE to pollute the area to get ink.  He gave it a 8/10, I personally give it a 5/10😕
Using everything you shine out to the world 1/10 yeah....... so expensive an yet the country are cheap to use it 1/10
❤💖
You move those hands more than two Spanish put together
WOW!! At the end of the video, I realized my mouth was opened through the entire video. Thank you for this enlightening and at times, mind boggling video. I love your content!!
We do bbq at night 😂
4, plastic is essentially in every asphalt, its just that asphalt is the lowest quality plastic and in liquid stage
Jesus christ
Really like these. The ecopod and pollution pens have alot of real world potential. Also that reusable straw ill definitely try.   Also the transparent solar looks like something that will be totally awesome and will change everything.
You know plastic keeps geting hated on but look at all the stuff it can make plus soon all plastic will be gone then most of that stuff is now useless
6:47 ???😳😳
i've wanted one of these for years and i still plan on getting one 9:15
Him still the best  plate I ever eat :me you at a plate before 🤨
Bro you could have lied to me about the paper one
I just watched this whole video while sitting on the toilet. I can't stand up. My feet are asleep......
Yes You are right brother 🔥❤️💪❤️
1.this is the only area that I've seen vegans doing good and qudos for that 2. I know yes all of these are really great upfront but the harsh truth is that they all have their downsides Especially if it includes plastic I'm not against any of them as I believe these are all initial stages of these projects and ideas which we will later evolve then to be more Efficient
about the plastic roads... plastic roads can release micro plastic particles due to the facts that tiers rub of of them and cause them to mix in with air or water, meaning you will be consuming plastic along side of everyone else.
I love how he still use what this gadget that he review in one this videos
The end made me cry... thanks you for having your sponsor at the end
I would love to see you review different electric cars  🚘
"Do you know what I've been drinking under the table this entire video?"  I was hoping it would be bourbon.
You really seem to enjoy doing these themed videos.  Keep them coming!
What if the transparent solar panel can be implemented in Phones? It could help increase battery life and could help reduce charging time
So would one of those tree planting drones be a helicopter parent?
why is it that whenever a big youtuber makes a video like this is like 75% snake oil. plastic roads, solar roads, recycled roads et al are all thoroughly debunked as worse for the environment.  asphalt is literally the most recycled material in the entire world.
I saw the Instagram post before this, and it broke the illusion! :-)
wdym " Im feeling wet " ??????
A video about new and upcoming tech that was adapted or taken from Military tech would be cool.
This is the best youtube video I have ever seen in my life I want to buy every single thing you presented XD
i don't know why but this guy's videos keeps me laughing inside , he educates us with his videos and never forget to entertain too, im just loving it
Mark rober is happy for 2
We have Pasta Straws in some restaurants here, can highly recommend
milk? really?
Eco-capsules are literally giving me Dragonball vibes. And I dig that.
the very first invention was so amazing(using plastics bottles to make clothes), i was so excited to watch whole video, I must say this was most satisfied tech video I have ever watched.
Arent you muslim
Wow
you forgot to mention mrbeasts channel
It's his best video yet. Thank you so much for making such a great collection.
Amazing inventions to make this one we live in, a better world! 😍
cool and awesome
Wow! This video is #25 on TRENDING
Amazing technologies.
THE ROMAN EMPIRE CAME, AND FELL. JUST LIKE HUMANITY WILL FALL. JESUS CHRIST IS COMING SOON .. ANSWER. SEEK JESUS CHRIST WHILE YOU STILL HAVE BREATH IN YOUR LUNGS.
most of these can be good for crypto mining
Vegan leather is an L
Miss gurl always has a way to Rick roll us
Tag Elon Musk
Arun: My name is Angelwhosetheboss, I’ll catch you on the next one (outro theme plays) 😹😹😿
Loving that SoapBottle!
Company recycles 31 billion plastic bottles and counting: 2/10 Rechargeable battery pack: 6/10
And I'm sorry but kill the elephants I'm not using that ever and I bet germaphobes can agree
This is the best video i have seen from a leading tech youtuber. Thank you for caring.
Bro are u friends with the vegan teacher lol
Sir you wasted a whole paper while writing 8/10 with air ink
Great video! Looking forward to "666 DEVILISH inventions to destroy the WORLD"
i liked the poo paper
Waoo He is my birth mate 24th of Oct.
Lies about the carbon emissions the air miles to get exotic foods to us  is so much it’s better just eating locally sourced foods and eating British or what ever country your from and help the farmers pls I study agriculture and vegans are painful but we raise the animals to be eaten so pls pls eat British foods and meat.   Oh and this vegan leather bruh lmao the chemicals that go into it are most likely tested on animal and again the air miles and carbon emissions to get pineapple leaves over to the uk jesus
I'd say the technology to convert humanity to an environment friendly lifestyle is finally here, now society just needs to be ready for it and willing to accept it.
Mrwhosetheboss: The first reusable straw is the z straw.  Metal straws: am I a joke to you
Honestly this is a bunch of feel good stuff. If you want to make a difference use less resources.
I know this isn't a great channel to say this, but the way to try help the planet is to realise that our recent era of huge technological growth and consumerism is not sustainable. We've become spoiled as hell, and it has us hurtling to the abyss.
6:48 ayo 🤨🧐
The thumbnail is so cool
that's awesome tech
In Australia we try to have 4 minute shower and we also have water saver shower heard and the pressure is great.
This video restored my faith in humanity
Mrwhosetheboss's uploads feel like a gift from heaven ✨ 😌
Whats in the box
honestly the tropical smoothie cafe strawberry edible straw is like way tastier than a normal straw and better for the environment
Just so everyone knows, eating meat is actually good for the environment in a way because animals produce a lot of carbon dioxide, everyone would have to stop eating meat to stop people mass producing these animals for it to be effective, but if you eat meat than the demand just goes higher. its a lose lose situation, might as well pick the one with the nutritious and tasty meat!
can't find the link for Huel
"I cant stress how cool this is!!!!!" - 5/10 lmao
I'm early to witness the Dyson Sphere
Loved every part of it
About showers... just use pail and dipper.
Me
Seeing our boss in this outfit is actually a fun twist to what I'm used to seeing. I definitely vote for the community to keep voting doe these!
6:56 There are two current (t)issues...I saw what you did there😀
This options are pretty cool and all but you know what's the main problem?  CONSUMPTION If we could change our behaviors and stop to consume and buy so much crap half of this wouldn't be necessary
vegan is a scourge of the earth
6:47 tho 😏
going vegan prevents you from getting vitamin k and k2 which can lead to a lot of bleeding
Freaken awesome dude 🤟 😂 Though no matter how wonderful these may be, we all know it boils down to that number one human created  limitation... Moooooney. Can you imagine how many amazing mind boggling things we could create if there were no monies 😂
Is that huel bag is not plastic? 😂
If you ever see a soap that says: Hi, I’m paper bottle, it isn’t paper. It’s just paper on top of plastic
Man really put rick astley on poo paper.
Pineapple leaf fibers are used here in the Philippines to make fabric for clothes such our elegant barongs, the Filipino national costume, which sells very expensively if made from these leaves. The video clip that you have shown is from Dole Philippines. Thank you, Arun! 😘💕🥰
That Elephant thing is from SRI LANKA right? Thank you for Adding this! ❤❤❤
I've watched most of your videos for years. This was the most inspiring  one. Faith in humanity,  restored
Looking like Aladdin with Jinny inventions 👑
THE MUSHROOM BOX! INVASIVE SPECIES????? WHAT IF MUCHROOMS GROW INSTEAD OF DECOMPOSE?
You look like an ancient Greek ruler who knows about tech 😁
Plastic road is old news and it's not as great as it sounds. It in fact had more damage to the environment and us. Over time it washes microplastics into the drain and end up in ocean and finally in our food
If you get a black water system the water from showers and baths are used for  watering plants
Love your vids
The Guson Fusion is a good idea but it takes away the fun of barbecuing
Plastic roads are in the same category as solar roads. Interesting in theory, but will never work in a real world application. Because in this case what's under 100% of roads in urban areas.
Some great products.  Garmin Fenix 6 pro solar watch has had the transparent screen now for a while.  Good to see them building it on a larger scale.  Awesome vid. 👍🏻
I’ve always said that technology is only a tool in the hands of the one that uses it. It’s not to blame for the state of society. This video is evidence that technology can do good for our world, if in the right hands and used for good intentions.  Hoping these innovations become a common thing in the near future. I especially love the ones that naturally generate electricity.
Hello Jesus🙏
Vegan food let’s go
8:27 girlfriend reveal
Nice 👍
MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS!!
Do u smoke🤨
Link is not working
i can listen to Arun all day
I love the content and your costume which  is so godly... 🙂
I've only seen the plastic road before.   I hate that i love this channel so much, but it's just a channel that forces me to watch it because it always delivers.
“Drones that can fly around above the ground” yup, sounds like a drone
Well. I love the plastic road, why is no one using them? I definitely have to look up about it. Is it resistant against shock waves caused by earthquakes? Does it have the same resistance to car driving on it? Because it looks like a faster and more tidy way to build a road. I mean you could literally have a small room on the side of each panel to store and pass cables for internet connection or electricity or whatelse (which would result in much easier maintenance).  Other inventions look good, the worms that basically digest plastic I've heard of them years ago and still nothing has changed, maybe it's risky to fill the entire planet with one species of worms, might make more damage than what it's saving.  Solar transparent panels look an amazing idea, it will take decades though to enter the market... they are probably sick expensive and once it enters the market it will take half a century before most houses will replace their old windows for new ones with this technology, we need better and faster way to produce green energy. By that time (50ish years) we will probably have the most green and efficient way to produce energy by nuclear fusion.  Walking on those tiles to produce electricity is good for small purposes but it costs a lot and it takes a lot to produce each tile and it's pointless, the first idea to use plastic bottle to make clothes was far better and the effort that company has put so far is much bigger than any of these inventions you mentioned.  Drones to plant trees I love it, it's probably the smartest way to plant trees and keep track record of any tree planted.  Plastic straws are disappearing and that's good, but the new kind of paper-ish straws suck and a portable straw isn't the solution, people will lose it unless you make it hella expensive but in that case no one will buy it.  Vegan bacon like any vegan food that imitates meat is pointless at this point, we have already started to synthesize meat that it's just like the real one without killing animals.  The process to have leather from pineapples is cool but if it doesn't get mass embraced it's pointless. Also you'll need to destroy hundreds of KM² of land to produce enough to completely replace that from cows... I don't know if it will make any good to the environment but surely to the cows... the same kind of thinking goes to poo paper... why are we even thinking to how make more ecological paper when we literally have everything digital. Paper should be a luxury.  That small house that has everything and is completely energy efficient, is cool wonder if there's any bigger version.      There's a nice amount of good inventions in this videos though are probably too expensive to produce for the mass or to inconvenient to actually use.
Very fun to watch!
Were you doing an experiment in this video? The amount of times you pointed and waved your hands into the camera almost hypnotised me. It was very distracting.
I like how you catch things
25 minute shower. I'm wet, wash, rinse, get out... maybe four minutes if I take my time.
Have Australians never heard of BBQ pits?
Who else feels like that Repreve company that turns plastic into clothes should get way more points.
This reminds me of that web series VSause used to do, D.O.N.G (Do Online Now Guys)
How many of you noticed the bacon cooking on the right bottom of the screen.
Hell yeah plastic clothes that melt to your skin in a flash fire
Hi
Hello
1:00 I use bar soap. Now what?
Nuclear technology being left out once again 🥲
#7 sucks if ur gluten free
If you have not subbed to this guy then I don't know what you are doing with your life
Arun wakes up one day and thinks, "hmmm I kind of want to be Jesus"
i got the best idea i think plastic roads at 12.53 why should we make them make electricity let me explain: when we drive on them it produces electricity like he talked about in this video like in club, i think we would get lots of energy out of it
12:02 didnt rick and morty do this?
"I'm feeling wet just thinking about it" no that's what she said? I'm disappointed Arun.
This one’s great mate!
7:10, but isn’t the reason those trees are even there in the first place because of tree cutting companies, they do plant back what they cut, so they should be somewhat neutral compared to the land being used for buildings, etc.
6:16 uhhhh..... I only have 2-3 minute showers
Can we just talk about how he tried to climb the tree?
Algae, when used in conjunction with AI-powered bioreactors, is *up to 400 times more efficient than a tree at removing CO2* from the atmosphere. ... Algae can consume more carbon dioxide than trees because it can cover more surface area, grow faster, and be more easily controlled by bioreactors, given its relative size.  so why not just plant that instead
Milo 🐈
The only thing that will ever really taste like bacon, is bacon.  Can't be fakin' bacon.
Hey Arun can you please review 2022 nebula Anker laser 4K projector. Everyone is suspicious of the techs performance. Only 2 videos out there that don’t go much into the details.
The Huel link doesn't work 😩
10:34 is it just me or the a in eat is a bit broken
And yet changed nothing, typical crap content being pushed out here.
Pinatex(VeganLether) is Proundly from Philippines   5:17
You always bring good energy in your videos, and I appreciate the clean editing.
Arun be like let's not do this video , i haven't found a creative sub to the channel "word". Yet 🤣🤣
I didnt know that cha time is an international brand.
Its gonna beinteresting when we stop producing plastic….but then cant build roads/clothes out of recycled plastic.
A lot of these sound dubious at best, wind turbines, for example, are more efficient when they're larger, hence why wind farms use the largest possible wind turbines, small wind turbines are next to useless, notice we weren't told how much power they produce. there's so many of these schemes that are scamming people by promising these green solutions that don't really work and they're preying on good people trying to save the planet, don't trust these claims that sound too good to be true, they're usually either exaggerating or hiding something, do your own research. There's loads of videos exposing similar inventions to these as frauds.
I love these videos
I hobeslty love the things in this Video BUT, the Soapbottle is just unnecessary. There already is hard soap that works perfectly for washing your hair, but you could also use most genereic pieces of soap for your hair, body and hands. Liquid Soap and Bodywash are far more resource intensive and harmful for the environment to produce than normal soap. So just using a normal bar of soap would still be the better alternative.
one company turns carbon into tiles.
they have plates with seeds embedded in it so after u can just plant the plate and grow trees.
i think repreve worked with team seas as that's as much a they have
Hello
I think plastic road is make more microplastic to waterground
By not buying leather you don't save the cow... The cow is still killed for consumption and it's skin is just a byproduct. That cow will die no matter how much vegan leather you buy 🤷
Finally, A knew a video!!
Veganism is like 80% meat envy.
Also, when you are talking about foods, several things you need to keep in mind:  1) food is not just a mix of proteins and vitamins, but all about a particular food is also about how it gets absorbed by our bodies.. so, any man-created alternatives (be it using other animals or artificial materials) actually doesn’t incorporate that most of the time. So.. it’s not just about a number of proteins, but about a lot more.  2) you aren’t “saving animals” when you don’t eat them, because they actually were grown for that purpose. If you didn’t eat that animal, the chances are they wouldn’t even exist otherwise. Long gone times when we ate wild animals that we hunt 😄.  I understand what you are saying is tailored to a western person shaped by society to make it seem like they are “eco-friendly”, “equal”, “fair”, etc…. But it’s really sad that then any common sense gets thrown out of the window.
I think these inventions are cool, don’t get me wrong, but the majority of carbon emissions comes from factories and the US and China are the biggest offenders. They make up something like 80% of all emissions so why should we have to alter our lives so much when it actually won’t make much of an impact? Until these countries figure out how to cut their carbon emissions then eating vegan bacon and wearing plant leather won’t mean shit.
15 should be waaaaaay lower (you could just not use a straw or have a metal straw or many others, not that cool really by comparison)
Can your next video have a surfshark sponsor
What's this jacket he shows there at the beginning? Looks sick.
"floppy"   *that's what she said*
Damn I love these videos.
All these fake alternatives to beef are less healthy or just has bad for you eahts the point
Such a good a entertaining video
One straw alternative is really good - NO straw.   I think that straw is the most unnecessary piece of plastic ever.. and for what? Because people are lazy and can’t tilt their glass or cup..? 😏
great video dude, but the music was kinda distracting.
But all cloths are already made of plastic that itself is polluting with plastic
Plastic road is so amazing that ground water is definitely not going to get polluted by microplastics!
who the frik takes 25mins showers?
＼(〇O〇)／
Bro you can just go ahead and throw that fake bacon away no1 wants that
Did you know their is this cool patent invention that will literally create water almost anywhere on this planet
From divine… to glorious… to Godly.
you should do more purchasing sprees (where you buy a bunch of stuff from wish, aliexpress or amazon and show them off in a video) those are by far my favorites.
Can I have a phone
Did you just Judge people who trying to make our planet better? While you are just sitting on your chair and doing nothing? Really...?
In some countries in Asia you can get a straw made out of reeds or some kind of plant like that. They can be reused multiple times to.  I bought a package online. Was not disappointed 😊
One little flaw, when you return to the kitchen to taste the facon, your Gold leaves crown is turned to the other side than the top ten talking head. Though….such a god tier class vídeo 😍
The thumbnail
The wind tree would be perfect in Wellington.
21 inventions is #21. Nice.
he said 21 of the most toxic tech fails, when he's supposed to say 19🤦🏻‍♂ 17:23

Dude what the fuck r u wearing
I have yet to see a plastic straw on a beach, let alone lots of them. It's a conspiracy!
Awesome video keep up the awesome work!
Y'all realize none of these shits gonna reverse enough damage for us to not be extinct in 50-100 years right
This is the first time I saw his Kitchen
6:48 That’s what she said.
Yaaaay
Lol. Cloud storage. You're amazing Arun (and everyone else that works on each episode)
The problem is he’s British, he doesn’t know what true bacon tastes like, so he can’t compare the vegan bacon
They should make toilet molds where you poop in it, then it gets hard, it it's a shape of a toilet mold... So that you can poop in it again!
Do you keep all the phones you buy or you give some away to people?
All I can focus on is how he says algae! And I hate paper straws!!! Like mmmmm my coke has pulp now! And also the leather industry doesn’t kill cows just for their leather! Think about pollution from the butcher industry that the fake leather would cause!? Right now meat butchers don’t let anything from the animal go to waist!
Don't whe breathe out carbon anakside???
Plastic roads seems like a good idea to you...? Ever hear about air pollution produced by abrasion to the road surfaces? You figure cancer rates would go up or down with all the roads being made of plastic..?
4:20 I feel like they should just amek spoon straws
I qant to know if you can eat the mushroom box
Pun Lord
Dying at the that's what she said joke about straws LMAO
I like Bearded Arun.
Guyz i just wanna ask you about qhat is the better phone option Samsung Note 10 + or Galaxy a52s? Which one should i buy i am really confused!!!
WOOOWWW very good video as always and interesting ideas that ARE GENIUS AT the same time :D 😅👌👌🔥💯
i would buy huel but it isnt in canada
We once tried to make glass that can generates electricity but it was not enough
Time stamps please!
BEST THUMBNAIL ON YOUTUBE. PERIOD 🔥🙌🏻
I want real pigs!!
Im a god teheheh
This guy is magician for videos, i haven't watched single video without enjoying
I so much admire your enthusiasm for tech and the quality of info you disseminate through your videos. I wish you can mentor me.
❤️❤️❤️
Those plastic roads seem like they would be very slippery when there's ice...
I just love this guy video always have details  and the robe lol fits you perfectly😂🎩
"He literally comes the second we stop recording." Yeah, like a lot of YouTubers.
she said
Bummer that Biotrem products came wrapped in plastic
Hello Arun for the plastic roads please don’t use them again they’re not good and they’re mostly unless do your research
If trees die for the paper I'm using pen and leaf
Nah yous will never replace bacon at all ever.
I found your long lost brother Dar Mann
16:32 yeah, you're looking really convincingly filled with joy 😅  Your Breitenhuber wasn't so wrong at all, german ei is like a y, use a sharp R and BRYtenhuber is the way to go 😋
1:59  YEET!
The industrial revolution and it good consequences By Arun the MrWhosetheboss manifesto
Erin the vegan would be proud
"Feeling wet just thinking about it" 🤔🤔
Here is plot twist: plastic straws ARE reusable
So no one gonna talk about how he says algae
Arun, please reach out to heal about their packaging, doesn’t seem very eco
"that's what"
I really like these types of videos
Can anyone tell me the music used from 14:47?
Broo why did u dressed like young Hercules ? 😁😄, i like it , please never change that uniform,  keep it like a symbol of your channel 😉 👍👍👍👍🤘🤘🤘👉👉👉

This is great! I hope there is also a version of this video where everything is already available and we can purchase today. Huel is a good example (wonder where that would rank if put into that list)
Mrwhosthegod
You forgot to add the link for Huel
Stevia is gross and gives me headaches.. any alternatives?
I went to the elephant poo paper place in thailand, it’s amazing but il be honest it didn’t smell amazing
you made the whole video without explaining your outfit lol....Also you sponsoring a company that shipped you a healthy product inside of a plastic bag? maybe I'm wrong..
A subscription to the channel will be heavenly
I have renewed hope for humanity
6;45 that's what she said 😌
4:50 my mom is vegetarian, and she loves cooking so she uses a lot of fake meat products to make our family meals that are really healthy. My personal favorite is what we call "featloaf" (Fake meatloaf)
They call him jesus but i call him who’sthebossus
My only problem with these inventions is that most if not all of them are more expensive than the thing they are trying to replace which makes it a problem for lower class and even middle class people which is most of the people on earth.
Hey I just wanted to say that the plastic "solutions" you covered such as the plastic roads are not actually saving the planet or doing much good as they are just giving an excuse to companies that are producing the plastic. If we really wanted to save the planet we would have to shut off the plastic waste being made, not make an excuse for ourselves to keep using and making plastic waste. Another point is that the plastic roads are actually not very good for the air and for the peoples health as every time a car, truck, bike etc goes over the plastic road, plastic particles are scraped off into the air, contributing back into the air contamination. I just dont think it is right for you to mislead your viewers into thinking these inventions are really saving the planet when they really aren't. A proper solution is to somehow make the plastic manufactures to stop creating the plastic in the first place and use more eco friendly alternatives.
Still my best tech reviewer any time any day
made my day.
Aaron 6:46 WHAT  THE FAWKKKK!!!!!!
Please give me a new phone🤐
This video was Ink-redible!
Kudos to inventions getting rid of plastic and thanks for making this video. But why are you selling a product packed in plastic at the end?
Yes.
The last one can lead to phones charging themselfs when outside
uh I take 75 min showers
MORE AND MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS <333 totally loved it
that thumbnail lmao
Number 9 I saw that over 2 years ago.
This video is so heavenly made
I love this!!
this was a cool vid
7:36 if someone who eats paper is watching this you might wanna check what kind of paper it is
0:57 I'm always so impressed at the way you catch off screen tossed items without looking.  PLEASE include the bloopers at the VERY end of the videos from now on? PLEASE!
These are all wonderful but they need to all be implemented world wide like This Year.
the vegan diet is always at risk of potential nutritional deficiencies and i doubt the dietary supplements to compensate would be vegan. the fake leather is not new, it has always existed and was called vinyl. and all you shown was essentially a new way to make vinyl.
When everyone talks only about climate change as human’s insanity, your video shows humans still have hope !!! Great content !!!
6:47 Bro what???
That bacon cooking in the corner is so satisfying
You shouldn't be rating things based on the other items on the list. It's just not fair, and makes the company/product look bad. I hope everyone agrees with me :)
How do I invest in #2!?!
Sorry but I'm an atheist
The tastiest plate I ever had😆🔥!
This has to be the best thumbnail you've ever made🤤
4:06 That's what she said.
Great outfit😉👍
Let's hope the world hops onto these things and makes THEM trends.
Why at 8:28 there is a picture of someone pasted on another persons head.
Look at me man LOOK AT ME! O.O If you are lying about that bacon stuff Im out! You hear me!!!!
Grateful for this video. It’s such a relief to know that humans are putting in effort towards saving the environment. The presentation, the content and the excellent costume are all top notch
except that real leather is also a byproduct so abandoning it will just mean that it gets burned instead of just leaves...
Want more videos like this
'Save the planet'. The hubris of the deluded woke knows no limits. The 'planet' has no feelings, so what does 'save' mean? Unreliable power, low energy low impact plastics spurned, and the quest for universal poverty continues.
The girl Arun is hilarious. Ms. Arun
6:47 that's what she said xD
Hi
All really cool inventions, I hope to see these succeed. The most interesting to me was the transparent solar cell, as I'm currently working on solar cell tech myself at the university. How is the lifespan on those "organic salt" solar cells? Could you please point me to some papers on this? Seems like an interesting read. I'd like to know what materials are they using, and how they overcome the head-scratcher challenges we and countless others encountered.
The plate is stupid. I personally use a plate to put food on the cleanest possible surface that is separated from what is relatively a much dirtier surface. I'm not going to then eat the germs that are at the bottom of my plate by eating the plate.
10:10 Biotrem - the plates made to reduce plastic are packaged in it instead. loved the video though.
Except that solar panels (transparent or not) are not a long term solution either. It doesn't matter how many panels we install, if they wear out faster than each of them generates enough energy to break even from production and start being pure profit. Getting enough resources is also a problem.  Governments should start investing into proper nuclear plants again, despite what idiotic officials like Merkel do.  Nuclear reactors are much more safe than other energy sources, they only seem dangerous because accidents are rare and relatively bigger, thus easier to sensationalize in media. More people die working in hydrothermal plants or even wind plants, if only because of numbers - there is much more of these and they require more people. Not to mention that reactors that did fail would be considered illegal by modern safety standards anyway - we do learn from those sad instances. Oh, also Thorium.
amazing video 📹
That girl Arun is hilarious! Ms. Arun
My friend sent this to me because he was thrilled about the veggie bacon.  So, so glad he did!
You kept the costume throughout??? I mean, it's a good prop for the intro but isn't it a distraction from the stuff you're reviewing?
Oh great heavens this was amazing, now I don't think that humans actually will end up killing the planet. Please make more videos like this.
The thing with using recycled plastic to make things means that eventually there will be no more plastic in the ocean, which is a good thing but these companies will need to make alternatives to recycled plastic.
Loved the theme and the video was fantastic.
Did I just sit here and watch a tech YouTuber dressed as a Roman talk about spongy mushroom boxes? Yes, I did. And I loved it.
Love how the biotrem plate was made to stop single use plastic dinnerware, but was wrapped in plastic itself😂🤔
I have never heard the word algi said more
can i just say the seamless catches on the 2nd one
Lol wtf
Just commenting for the algorithm.
You are taking that 60s batman villain egghead to another level in a greek tunic.
Nope... no paper straw for me... I am the weird guy that has his own metal straw....
Eatable plate came in Plastic Wrap.  **Never gonna give you up.....**
Please make more of these type of videos, I also have an interest in saving our planet.
Boy you look handsomely funny today 🤣😂😆
Let me comment on these inventions. 21. Clothes, made out of plastic. Kinda makes sense, however is it REALLY good for skin and health in general?.. Questionable. 20. Soapbottle. In the real world as you cannot effectively close this "bottle" - you'll either have to use it one full "bottle" of shampoo at a time, or have issues with storing it in an awkward position to not spill it, or getting your shampoo dirty / spoiled (ever experienced that? if no, you're really lucky) 19. "Mushroom box". Makes sense, thumbs up. 18. Wind tree system. Makese sense, thumbs up. 17. Lamp with algae. Well.... What if you leave for a while - going on a vacation? Will it die? 16. Biohybrid buildings - not sure if that is really making any difference or just "looks green" 15. Zstraw. Imagine wgere you have to put it to have always with you ('cause you really will need this ALWAYS as you never know when you will want to buy a drink). It will be perhaps in your wallet. Good luck with making it a) fit b) keep it really clean c) after buying a drink and drinking it in a street, while walking, putting a dirty straw with rests of what you have been drinking, to the wallet... then forgetting you had done so for a couple of days... or maybe just willing to drink smth another from what you've been drinking in a couple of hours after the first drink while you've not yet been home so the string is still dirty and you wanted to use it while in the street.... total mess. 14. Facon. if that REALLY feels like a bacon, then maybe ok 13. Pineapple leather. makes a lot of sense, thumbs up. 12. All that shower water limitation. That s*cks SO MUCH. Taking shower is not about just getting yourself wet and feel the pressure of water. It is also about the AMOUNT of water and heat which it also gives to your body. If you for some reason reduce the amount of water by all that "fancy" shower heads, you will end up being just angry of not getting what you want from a single shower and will spend just MORE TIME in the shower. It will lead eventually to spending even more water. These kind of inventions really s*ck A LOT. Believe me I tried to use a lot of different sorts and kinds of them, they are the same - piece of nonsense. 11. Poo paper. One more reason not to use paper at all - world moves to digital, right? Let's forget about the paper and about this one as well.... It... stinks. 10. Power bank with a wind turbine. Okay, what is a use case? You are somewhere on the beach, with a strong wind, for a couple of hours - makes sense. Otherwise - going down the street, you want to charge a powerbank... Okay, I will stay somewhere in the city for a couple of hours with a turbine which can easily fall on someone's head or...? Very limited use cases, at the end of the day. 9. Messed up barbecue. It's total waste of time developing this type of thing. Why? Barbecue is not only about cooking - it is also about looking at the fire, that smell and everything connected what you try to eliminate by this "invention". All a power generator to a ballerina - that would be energy efficient - why she is wasting so much energy dancing?... Absurd 8. Ecocapsule. Makes sense, but what is the price?... It costs really a fortune, and the space inside is so limited, that for that price it doesn't make ANY sense. 7. Edible plate. Well... You put something on a plate not only for convenience, but also to not use a not so clean table for keeping the food on it... and then let's eat a plate, which was on that "not so clean table". Biodegradable plate - then ok. But edible - no, thank you. 6. Ink from air pollution. What will happen when the air pollution will decrease? It's so temporary invention.... 5. Generating electricity from walking - maybe. Depends on the amount of electricity actually generated, costs of maintenance such a thing and how to dispose that. And how much pollution will be done when creating such a thing....? 4. Plastic road. Great invention! Especially on a sunny day, when the sun heats the plastics and it produces a lot of "healthy" vapor...Yummy! 3. Mealworms for plastics. Well... You will have to pay money for getting that chemical, right? However, still doable. Ok, thumbs up. 2. Tree planting drones. This absolutely makes sense. Big thumbs up. 1. Transparent solar panels. I hope they won't cut the infrared spectrum as well - don't forget we get not only visible light through our windows.... So, in general - few inventions from that list make sense, others are just "looks green" but actually is sort of a useless tech or even more - a scam  (like with showers, I think that type of "inventions" should be banned as they are making the opposite from what you expect). One good thing though - people at least try to make something with a problem we have. I hope there will be more real inventions in the future, which will indeed fix the issues we have today.
This will be the best video I've seen all year. I can confidently say that in the second week in January. 👍🏻
I can't find a link in the description for Huel
This looks like the right kind of people to buy the eiffel tower.
Pinatex is a scam, it's pineapple fibers coated with polyurethane that's not biodegradable nor recyclable.
What's he wearing underneath doe? 😳
👍👍👍👍
10:12  "There's no real downside" Just ignore the plastic wrapper.
The shower is really cool cause usually even normal showers barely have enough force on max settings
Hey bro I don't see the link to Huel...
Poo paper just openly advertising child labour like ye what's up hello
OK now watch the world ignore every invention
Ye
Ah yes plastic wrap on plant products and other things.
Ok lol
I love the cat
*mrwhosetheboss* :for 21 toxic tech fails,click here *me* :continues to see it as 19 toxic tech fails
I’ve known about the elephant poo paper concept for years, but never seen it executed this well. Good job elecosy!
Saving the animals ? 🤔They  gonna finish eating entire forest and all plants and each other of the universe 🤣
For #12 just use water buckets and fill it up that way you can save water and fill it up wheen need it
11 is the shittiest idea i've ever heared .
What brand of facon is that tho
👍
"from divine to glorious to godly"  I thought divine meant the same thing as godly but alright 😂
I think you should really mention atleast a single con to them if any, or where in the development stage they are. Otherwise one can genuinely wonder and get annoyed, as to why the hell are these not being implemented or atleast talked about more...
Mrwhosetheboss was planning to go to camping. Nice
1980s: There will be flying cars in the future 2022: *edible plate*
Nice idea on 3, but would that not create CO2 out of the plastic? It sure is cleaner than burning, but still much too little to make a real difference. Edit: grammar
the straw is a good idea but isn't the cup still plastic ?
The way you are dressed isn't very appropriate, I know many wouldn't understand - but it's quite blasphemous.
Amazing!!! I've been shortlisted AGAIN WOOHOO!!! 😂😂😂😂. Who the fuck is doing this scam!!!???
Nah bacon is bacon, once you use plant for meat there's a difference,  i tried alot of vegan meat before taste weird fake . Nope nope we still need real meat , it's not going anywhere out of all these invention , only some of these can only use by the mass anyway. Arun are just too much in to the eco friendly product.
These all sound completely awesome, And i'm looking towards a bright future with these being implemented En masse!  Now, let's just wait for the companies to lobby against the ones that let you avoid their services, like water or electricity...
dressed like Jesus
Ok, but who the hell showers for 25 minutes? I'm done in 7-10 minutes 🤔
bro the air ink isnt just cutting pollution its literally removing it
15% of the people who came her came to see those inventions. the other 75% came for the puns 😂
My favourite invention mealworms
foldable straws, shower heads and vegan bacon over mushroom packaging? idk
At the end he say 21 Toxic Tech Fails but the title of the video is 19 Toxic Tech Fails ._.
I like watching his videos but does he really have to make a funny on every thing he presents. 😒🙄
Ur puns are ink-credible
I don't think most people realize that the paper industry plants more trees than any other company business or industry by planting 2.4 billion trees a year
Why does this guy look like a martian from the show called The Expanse
I like this kind of stuff @Mrwhosetheboss .  Cell phone videos are okay but I will only get a single phone every 5 years or so.  The reason I watch is the entertainment with well researched information.  Your are. Err edutational.
_"Facon"..._ Where this world is heading to?! 😂
I am not able to find Huel links!
07:08 Rickrolling as always🤣🤣🤣
Stick a wind tree in the windiest place in the world, it'll collect power. Give that power out worldwide.
The Zeus of Tech!
Jesus is amazing
4:09 that what..... what
The future sucks.
OMG you sold out in one video soooo hard :DDDD I think even vegans now want to try meat :DDD
Some of these inventions have me real optimistic about the next few decades
That's what she said🤣
Seventeen minutes of Arun's puns.... what's not to like..... <cough> ;-)
Dont be vegan, cuz then you cant pump the musclees, so please dont be dumb
1:32 just use soap?
12:18 that would be bad for nature as it would spread lots of microplastics :/
Sadly the truth is that this is the same old story. There are a ton of really cool gadgets and stuff, but for the most part they just stay so and doesnt become widely available and popular
I love the costume he looks 🤩
The Huel link isn't working? Maybe region restrictions?
Anybody else think he looks like a roman king? Great video. 👍👍👌
It's funny when I see video's about saving the world and environment .... I appreciate and support 100% the efforts that are made by technology to cover the climate / polution problems we created so far. But these videos never mention the one major thing to do to save our planet:  'Don't reproduce'  --> that would get a 10/10 is   Simple, biological and no need for special technologies.   Amen
Educative piece
The problem for me with all of those inventions, is that poor people like me can't even slightly afford these things. And I'm not in the minority, many people would prefer to ditch nature just to live an easier life.  The prices must drop for people to see the appeal.
4:09 you forgot the "she said"
Bro where is huel link
Wind trees....the image of those looks like someone tried to make a Christmas tree out of used butt plugs 😂😂😂
Best youtuber
yo just wanted to say that I and i think many others really appreciate you using your impact and range to promote these things. youre awesome keep it going!!
You forgot to link the Huel!!! 😂
7:20 it went from forcibly killing elephant's to forcibly making it poop ungodly ammounts a day to cover the stock needed to replace regular paper. 😂
I love the smol "liar" at 1:07
I cant find the repreve jacket, pls send me a link of the jacket u bought!!!
I think you should watch Thunderf00t’s video on plastic roads, it’s a concept that just won’t work in reality. Asphalt itself is already a 100% recyclable material.
Really good content!
Idk why but this vid gave me serenity peak vibes
What about the Passion fruit ocean air nature cleaner 69 Pro Max Edge Fold 3.5
I misread the title and thought it said “to enslave the WORLD”
Very inspiring video. I like very much number 1! The Dutch by the way has a vegan leather made out of mango.
A cheap house costs "only" EUR 50.000? My house was around EUR 20.000 and I have 5 years trying to pay it 😂
This is a cool video and I'm a big fan but remember that from a eco conscious angle, the best thing you can do is not buy new stuff.
Dumbass me thought you could recharge the air ink pen from your home
All inventions are good except the plates. Unfortunately celiacs cant use them.
Well, making clothes out of plastics does more harm to nature than good. Levi's had tgis concept which they kinda abandoned because plastic clothes contribute to micro plastics being end up in the ocean and thereby entering the food chain.
My friend has a book made of elephant poo
Huel discount code maybe 😶 hahaha
Climate change is a religion and has no scientific fact to back it up...
the music was kinda loud today tho, lol.
OK so aron knows what bacon taste like. Defintely not a muslim than :P
Nooo, he went for the plastic road... Im sad. These don't work mate, plastic ain't as abrasive as blacktop, and it's not as durable, because of it's softness( because it's made out of bottles, and in general soft things(
"im feeling wet just thinking about it" LMAOO good one arun
Since there are becoming more and more electric cars what if the partially power the cars by a turbine located behind the front grill and the air that comes through could also cool anything that needed it could that be possible or not?
9.62 million almost there Brodie I want an invite to 10 millionth sub party!!!!
“I’m feeling wet just thinking about it” was uncalled for. Just uncalled for 😆
thank you so much for stopping the tech reaction videos and actually getting all the products your talking about so you can give your real opinion,  your videos are awesome 👌 👏 😎
The title of the video got me here. Nice one
Call Elon and let's send this trash to deep space.
really loved the video. finally our planet will be saved by these kind of smart ideas, if we dont meet the same fate as dinosaurs.
All of those are such great ideas! I wish they’d get more recognition and be used more 🥰
This video gave me so much hope ♥️
Everyone please spread the word to get involved with vote counting in your local area. to make sure we dont have 4am shifts like we did in 2020
I don't see a link in the description lol. Great video though :)
The robe💀
I’m feeling wet just by thinking about it 😁
❤️❤️
I liked the way you dressed like a Greek philosopher!
this countdown animation is much better than the last video's! far less distracting
"I'm feeling wet just thinkin about it" CALM YOURSELF, DAMN...
Mate, I'm sorry to say but for energy the best solution is still nuclear and I have no idea why we are trying to reinvent the wheel every bloody time. Anyway, a great vid. Cheers!
You need to check out more about mushroom packaging as well as many other things. Mushrooms will be used for so many things such as packaging, clothes etc.
The little countdown timers at the edge of the screen. I just can't explain how great that makes me feel.
12:38 When you prove to be brainless by not mentioning the huge issue of micro plastics
WHERES THE HUEL LINK?
Makes all the puns about heaven, God and angels. Is dressed like Zues. Never change Arun 👍👍
Interesting as always  Thank you
I… still have no faith in humanity.
Man these videos keep on getting better keep it up with the great content
No hate from this comment I love your videos and your accent is cool I’m not laughing at you for this. Now with that being said, you keep saying “Algy” dude
In my mind: how many takes did that throw take?
“Alright kids, make sure to eat your plate before you leave the table.”
Did he just bust out the term 'gallon'? Smh.
Please upload the next invention video soon
Thank you so much for this video at least we can think that their is still some hope for our beautiful planet 🌎
Just a question about the algae chandelier. Wouldn’t it produce carbon dioxide when the light is off? For example at night when they’re sleeping and the light is odd. There will be no light from a bulb or the sun.
Okay but that rickroll on poo paper 😭
Arup is my name
These puns keep getting out of hand, Arun. XD
I did a speech on solar glass in 2 years ago lol.
What is 2.5 gallons? Litres please? I'll have to look it up.
In order for the worm to save the planet we need to stop all violence and not beat it🤨
Biotrem plates sealed in plastic. 😒☹️
Arun it seems the link to Huel isn't right
There is as much clothes in landfills as bottles even more☹Here in the USA people in prison get three meals a day free medical care free shelter air conditioning or heat and a free education if they prefer, let them plant the army of trees we need planted 🌴🌳🌲😍
As a Muslim can I eat that facon?
10:09 lol it came in plastic packaging
OI ya gotta get outta my basement or I’ll keep ya in there
1:11 Every time some English Youtuber Like You prounuces an German Word, this Happens: 🤦‍♂️. I am From Austria and so i understand German and English. But now its Reverse time: I really Like your Videos, Mr. WeristderBoss
You might want to check out thunder foot he debunks the plastic road
11:11 🇮🇳🇮🇳
Those are some really cool things and I'm happy to see that we are making progress towards not damaging our planet. Now if they can get them to be feasible to replace plastic
It's a real shame the Ecocapsule doesn't have its solar panels angled towards the sun. Seems to me that efficiency (and greeness) lost to design-first approach.
Mrwhosethejesus
Too bad that the plastic roads would never actually work because cars are heavy (there is a reason why we haven’t done this already and why we use tarmac etc)
Wouldn't those transparent solar panels block radio signals?
bruh i lost my faith in humanity when i learnt about religion
Liar
Best.
I like how at 4:01 he pulled out the boba! Anyone else want one? Any weebs watching?😀
Ayo what are you doing at 16:49 😳😳
bruh the best video I've watched this year
Huel looks like it tastes good
Just imagine in the future the sentence "I've done my entire plate" literally will exist😂
That rick roll tho
And the huel link doesn’t work ;(
Cloud storage is a godly blessing too! 😏👍✨
ngl this is gonna sound weird but the thumbnail tasted like candy
Where on earth do u get these 😮😮
Wsit so if it collects light outside our spectrum, does that mean it collects UV light? We may have created solid Ozone layer bois
16:20.
Rickrolled at 07:10 dude is brilliant
Nice video
The issue with plastic roads is micro-plastic - or almost invisible plastic particles then then end up everywhere and are the reason you can find microplastic in everything (including food and our bodies). Already paint used to mark road lanes is a source of it - making the whole road plastic would drastically increase the micro plastics problem apparently. So yeah, many of these things aren't really a solution but a step towards one. By exploring options, and any problems or solutions that may come out of these options we might find a real solution.
Too easy
his "thats what she said" jokes are amazing
I thought there is a link for huel in the description
3:34 - Me.
Eco friendly plates- comes in a plastic and paper packaging. 🤣Lol
Hey I love your videos, Arun!
I hope theres an invention that answers my homework by it self and gets a good score
All this technologies is the kind of stuff I often talk about with people wondering why we don’t see more… we have a lot of potential energy and resources around us not being used enough or at all.
Bro your realy  the best
I think I just wasted my time by watching this.
8:30 catch me if you can. thank me later :D
I wanna know which psychopath takes 25 min showers 😂
This gives me hope for humanity
I love where the future is heading, people are being more accepted for who they are, cities are becoming healthy to live in, not the opposite. Energy is easily obtainable getting rid of the need for expensive gas, oil and petrol, even more taboo topics like sex is becoming more and more common to be open about and not to be afraid of.  I can't wait to live in a world where we can be our best selves, a true reflection of who we are, be intimate with whoever and however many people we want without judgment and to fix our planet one step at a time.
yes
I love this guy soo much
did anyone else catch the hot babe (arun's twin) around the group firepit? LOL
Man what a positive video in these negative times
But when all stop eating meat. There is too many animals
The solution for the plastic problem isn't to make clother etc. out of the plastic. Companies have to produce less plastic
Got a really positive outlook for our future after watching this video. I just hope all of these tech/inventions soon become commercially viable and get incorporated into our daily life!!
I like your outfit
Best video 😍😍😍
that nebia is a great concept bc i was worried how i could cut my 15-30 min shower, variable is wash hair day lol
i'm lactose intolerant
I think the air ink was a perfect time for a rick roll
AMAZING!! love the pineapples
These puns are really starting to kill me
The Ecocapsule won't work properly here in the UK (because ya know the weather here is very unpredictable)😂
5:50:     Me takes 30 min plus showers: ◉_◉
I reckon we'll see some of these on Thunderf00t's "busted" series. In fact, he's already done plastic roads. lol.
Gotta stop you at the 2.5 gal thing. It's federally standard that a pipe must NOT output more then 2.5 gal/min. A single google search would have helped you.
I really appreciate all the work you do, I'm enjoying literally all the explanation you give and the search behind , but please stop saying :'generate energy' we do NOT generate or create energy, we transform it.
we should stop war so less pollution. don't hear that from msm
There is a lot of greenwashing in this video, punctuated by idealist inventions that really won't become norm for a majority of the world. This was a much longer comment but I scrubbed most of it, knowing that most people just don't give a damn. Think though, plastic bottles recycled into clothes, they go from bottles to clothes then are landfilled because they can't be recycled further. Drinks companies can, and do, buy back their bottles time and time again because they can be repeatedly recycled back into bottles. Self sustaining pod is pretty good though.
I am going to trick you.   Read more
If you could get a Tesla with those windows I would buy it
I always love ur vids
4:59 I will never go vegan if I have to go out and hunt my own food
#5 is straight out of Rick and morty
where can i buy facon
If we’re gonna save earth we gotta act fast! I still have more than 3,5/4 of my life left! 😖
Devine means godly
a beetle cleans our poops
Nice idea!
Make more of tech out of this world
That's officially the slowest bacon being cooked in YouTube
Umm .You actually look hot in that outfit 🔥 .
I think plastic road are bad idea... Because of the friction micro plastic will be everywhere 🐸
4:09 😏
Zstraw is so useless, imma tell you have to solve the straw problem, just dont use the straw
I just bougt a Samsung galaxy a52
12:57 celeste music
"I tried, I promise!"
Alge not Al-ge XD
Arun is the best Youtuber no Cap
His neighbour’s must have been like “wtf r u wearing!?!”
Wow cant believe he covered the plastic road scam
Last one So solicitizing.
this video is ironic because its sabbath day
the ink pen thing isn't new arabs used to put bowls of water at the top of high buildings and let the smoke go through them to make ink atleast 1000 years ago.
The German designer is pronounces Braitenhuber
Poo paper is my choice for #1
Now I want some fake baccon
"Im feeling wet just thinking about it"
This channel is starting to not be technological lol. I kinda like it though.
Great video, loved the outfit.
The funny thing is that the biotrim product is packed with plastic but they are trying to reduce plastic🤣🤣🤣WTH
That ink pen sounds like science fiction
Your huel link has been deleted or suspended 😔
i still have A LOT of lost hope for humanity
I think the devil invented paper straws
Pretty amazing tech!!! so much great inventionsthat i can't wait to afford.... i want that pod home for myself but 50k Euros is above my my comedian salary in south Africa😂😂😂Thank you for the great content
The Jesus of Tech
Pretty ink readable Incredible
I really appreciates it when you show us the latest inventions. Always leave me with a positive mindset and impressed by the work  and ingenuity of all these people, it's not all doom and gloom yet lol.  Thank you !
Lol when Arun said "I'm feeling wet just thinking about it" made me crack! 😂
A LOT OF LOVE AND TNK A LOT BRO FOR YOU FROM🇮🇶 IRAQ🇮🇶 . !!!!!!!!:"? 🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🥀🥀🥀💞💕💕🌺🌺🌺🌺 ااً 🧡💛💚💙💜🖤⁦♥️⁩⁦❣️⁩💘💝💔💌💕💞💓💗💖⁦❤️⁩ff
6:47 U WHAT
next do inventions from hell made the devil him self stuff so dumb useless or just bad you want to die
Its a pity that all these Earth 🌎 saving ideas will be sold to make a profit and start the capitalist cycle over and over again until the solution is now a commodity
There’s no Huel link :)
my government gotta watch this video!!
I want to buy some Huel, where is the link
Bro, you sure that was Milk u drank?
Cool cool        But, like, 50% of these just don't work/aren't half as effective as already existing products or cons outweigh the pros...
Most of these are very gimmicky, but still I like these videos from you the most. Its very hard finding these on your own.
This is one of the best videos you've ever done. Fascinating and also meaningful.
I’m mad at Arun for making me hungry!!!! Lmaooo 😂
there’s no huel link
I was having a look at the nebula shower heads and they are reduculous, I would never pay £300 - £599 for a shower head. Not everyone has that money to be spending on reduculously overpriced products like these. The companies have great ideas but the pricing is absolutely ridiculous.
There are a lot of new phones in the market we are waiting for your reviews and opinion i prefer content where you explain new phone and tech and make comparison
Liked this video only for his dressing😂😂
That poo paper is not a shitty idea.
He even did the research about light and it's all accurate good job arun
Love the solar idea
This video is source of many startup ideas 😂🔥🔥🔥
So close to 10 million 🙂
please tell me im not the only one who the the "thats what" in 4:09
10 million soon ❤️
Did I get Rick rolled….. by poo paper?
4:05 💀
I wish there was links to the times vs just one link.
what an eco-friendly video❤ great work arun.
LMFAO “it gets soaky and then floppy”
Ngl if Netflix were to reboot Bruce Almighty my man could deffy play god
Awesome 🤩👌
The bright idea part🤣
6:30 do people actually buy this? Just buy a bucket and mug and use that to take a bath people!! saves water and money, and also the plumbing hassles it'll take to fit that shower head not to mention with buckets you can actually measure the amount of water you use, 1 bucket of water is always enough, 1.5 is also ok. You can buy buckets made of wood or steel if you're trying to cut back on plastic too or even just build your own and they're still cheaper than that shower head.
1:05 Impressive.
One of my favorite video from you so far. It was "Epic!!!"
Ha the shampoo he pulled out somehow i recognized "thats the one i use"
13:36 I’m lactose intolerant My Disappointment is Immeasurable and My Day is Ruined
the vegan leather you see in big brands around tho are JUST FING PLASTIC
I would be surprised if the energy generated by the energy harvesting floor tiles was a lot more than the energy required to make them. If it is not, then they are more of the problem than the solution.
'But still, its the tastiest plate ive ever seen' what, your eating plates every day for it to be tha tastiest🤣🤣🤣
This might be the best video I have ever seen!  So awesome!
🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
great video
Wind tree
Solve number 11 by using water instead
I already know that vegan teacher is watching and is going to review this video
Arun BHAI!!
I actually stopped watching Tech YouTubers as all of them started sounding cocky and arrogant, but not Arun….
Top 10 kickstarter scams
Imagine if you put that PaveGen stuff on a bed? 👀
How did they think of experimenting with elephant poo 💩
Best on this list: the fake bacon, the fake leather, the eco home, and the edible plate! That's amazing. Amazing list!
These plastic roads will blow a bunch microplastic in its sourrounding
Am I the only one to notice that poo paper have rickroll on it.🤣🤣🤣😂😂
3:00 The biohybrid chandelier is literally shining a flashlight on a solar panel.
He gave us hope on this planet
The most efficient and basically the only way to save the world is not to reproduce.
Amazing collection!
The algae pronunciation hurts mě ears 😂
Your videos are awesome. 90% of the time I open YouTube I'm hoping one of your videos are sitting at the top of my feed.
Mrwhosetheboss and vikkstar123 colab when?
8:48, I have a vacuum cooker, cooks things super fast.
12:57 when your ISO is too high so you lower exposure when editing
It's funny how those plates are supposed reduce plastic waste and yet they're packed in plastic
Yo that vegan leather should be #1. That's a genius way to use something that would be burned and thrown away.... Wow now I'm gonna Google it. Pineapple heads and corn....who would've thought?
This was brilliant Arun. More like this please!
2:40 Mans forgot he was british
Those that's what jokes are getting better and better
Biotrem was wrapped in plastic 🤦‍♂️
17:23 Mrwhosetheboss saying his own video title wrong
Quality contents 🔥🔥💥💙
Nice things. And while I "support" all of them (in one way or another) I feel I have to say that many of them have been around for some time now. Ususally by different brands. Compare, for example, the Upfall shower, Waka Waka, elephant dung paper. And... a WIND powered power-bank that's called SHINE? Am I missing something?
Pause at 4:09 lol
I just love how you're actually wearing the outfit from the thumbnail.  Superficial, I know. But little things like this just make me happy.
Love your creativity, witty jokes and the information overload that you provide us with <3 Keep up the great work! We love you.
9:16 Dragon Ball Coming to real life XD, Capsule Corp
That was incredibly awesome. Thank you for everything you do.
Number Two. "tree planting drones" No it can't water them !  1 ml of water which would be meaningless to a seed X 20,000 (10ml at a minimum), well I'll leave the math up to you, but i cant see that drone flying with four, fiffty five galon drums of H20
Боклуци на килограм...
12:14: South African clubs need this TODAY! They could literally avoid ever needing to pay for electricity!🙆🏽‍♂️🔥
The sad thing about a lot of these things is that they’re expensive to produce/maintain, and since every government or corporation has only one priority, profit, we won’t see much of it become the norm.
Did you know that there is a company which collects elephant poop to put into their Martinis? Yeah...
the wheat bran plate is also alternative for low calorie diet - just take up your plate and eat it no other worries .dont worry bout appetite because you ate the plate
i just want to know where he brought the greek tunic...
Some of these are compromises,not solutions.Fakon sounds more expensive than bacon,Vegan leather does not feel strong and durable,plates made from grains are a stupid idea.Most plates I have seen are made of ceramic.And not to mention plastic roads.The continuous pollution from the plastic,which "decomposes",not vanishes once it reaches 10.000 years,Will be felt by the earth and all in it.
4:09 I saw what you did lmao
Weed is the best plant to make paper, that’s why weed is illegal in the first place. Because corporations don’t wanna save the planet. They wanna stay rich and powerful.
I suspect the plastic roads was based on a much older idea. In Naperville IL I want to say about 20 years ago, the town was rebuilding old sidewalks. When the construction crews dug up the old sidewalks, they found... things. Old pots, pans, shoes, belts, and even gravestones. They were afraid they'd uncovered an old cemetery, and stopped work until they could determine what they had found. Turns out, in the 19th century, instead of using rock and gravel for the base of the sidewalks, a lot of places asked the locals to bring household detritus. Items that were too broken to use, but were too solid to be plowed into the soil. Yes, even gravestones.  (With respect to Naperville, there's a whole other story behind that. It involves a measles outbreak.) The old broken household items provided great drainage. So now a company is recycling plastic to use in the beds of roads. Yeah, such a novel idea.
Epic!!!!
great video!
bro sick costume
9 HR GANG LETS GOO
Great video like always Arun. One thing about the ecocapsule. For £50000 you could build a 2000sq ft house with all the bells and whistles in my place.
Thanks
Very good vid 👌💐
who has a 25 minutes shower is that normal
where's the powerbank?
so much bullshit in one video.
Love the content bro ❤️ from Uganda 🇺🇬
But that ecocapsule do be looking like a subnautica base
u look like ancient greek
Really heavenly 😍
Who needs magic when we have science
Now that's GREEN quality content!
#1  *cough* Dyson sphere *cough*
He's way too gay to be doing tech videos, he should have a movie deal or something
Where is the hule link???
Just want you to know, that yours is the ONLY channel on YouTube where I watch every video once it's released. Never miss it. As a person who does video and multimedia work for a living, I just want you to know your content is top tier.
Your video’s are sick bro 😎
Number 8 if it’s priced like that could be a hotel and it would take 500 days for your money back at 100 a night but without the cost of electricity.
Lol where I live you can buy a full sized house or a large flat for €50000
9:02 cursed fleshlight
Wish there was more Algae based tech, people don't realize how much more impactful/helpful algae is compared to trees!
This guy is awesome
Wait. So the solar glass is like tinned glass from minecraft, basically it does not let like through but u can see thru it
I always wait for his videos
Nice costume 😅
Pretty INKredible 😹
the shower head probably needs 2 times hotter water since the droplets cool down on the way down
Arun bro that your only 50000 euro capsule alone costs 10054025rs here in Pakistan😕, Dude I can start a massive Business with that...I don't see myself in the near future buying that😅 Anyways love your videos keep up!
Plastic roads was a scam, they never really went anywhere and took the money
Could we actually eat the mushroom package by mi 🤔
whats the cut on your left hand boss?
I m trading my oppo a54 pls trade with me :)
Mrwhosetheboss can you review the Redmi 9 plsease
Way to be racist
Do one about Replika, its an ai companion like the movie her
Do you know that God loved us so much that he Gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him shell be saved
20k 🌲 per drone...you need to explain bro
great video make these non-common tech explorer videos to inform the progress we as human mankind are making through efforts of brilliant minds among our species
This list gave me back some of my lost hope for this planet.. Thanks Arun, utterly thankful 🙏
10:10 are those plates wrapped in plastic??
কেমন আছো তুমি
5:54 reason I bath once a week . Save water guys :)
I wish Arun had better technical knowledge... e.g. the solar panels on the egg at 9:41... why are they curved?  The tree out of wind turbines a) is probably not silent, b) when it is used "enough", won't be a tourist attraction anymore, c) I prefer natural trees much more. The camp fire: when you use wood instead of coal, there is no carbon emissions, as long as you replant the trees. The pineapple leaves follow the same principle: they were grown by us, so burning them doesn't cause CO2 emissions, as we already caused the plant to collect all that CO2 from the atmosphere previously. (but yeah, as long as it's in paper form, it will store a little carbon)
What brand is that bacon from ?
9:27 Idea came from dragon ball z
#2 really made my day.  This may be the best carbon capture project I’ve ever heard of.
Most of these are actual scams or just not feasible by scale. I had to do a project for school about false marketing and I chose to have a renewable recourse theme. Clear solar panels, not feasible. Reusable straw, awful to manufacture. Plastic roads....really really bad - leave micro plastics in the environment, really bad for weathering (think sun on a plastic toy outside for a year) - most importantly... ROADS ARE ALREADY MADE OF REUSED MATERIALS. Just look it up. They're durable and not bad for the environment when they break up, and they're essentially recycled to become roads.
I didn’t know there were so many things people were making that is saving the environment currently!! I love this channel!!
That poo paper seems like a good idea but they need to change the name!
Thos video is a banger Arun I got the idea of the air ink bit because at that moment i was an ordinary underaged kid, i couldnt convince my parents to manufacture and do that stuff. But now i am happy that someone actually thought this. I dont care if i do it or someone else. What matters is that rhe planet is being saved either way <3
Anyone else have terrible with the video? It's pre-loaded and it's occasionally breaking up and lagging
6:49 i was looking for *Thats what she said*
Could you imagine Soapbottle detoriating on a shelf in the store. An the pain in the a** to clean it
This stuff is good but won’t it cost really much?
What happened to "EAT" at 10:34?
I'll catch you it the next one
Your videos are cringy but worth to watch(watchable)
The Vegan Teacher would love this.
All about the video was crushed by  hiers  Non biodegradable plastic  Like what's the use of video if you can't make your sponsors  agree to avoid it 😔
Trade involves the transfer of goods from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market. An early form of trade, the Gift economy, saw the exchange of goods and services without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards.
9:52 ... facon .. really ?!
13:34 "in the same way you probably have lactase enzymes to help you break down milk"  my lactose intolerant ass: "huh?"
whoo GREAT JOB!! I love this channel                                      Sorry had too..
Hey Aaron, The huel link is not available
Do vegans realize that fire is a natural thing
MrwhosetheGod u can call yourself now.   Great quality content 🔥
“Still the tastiest plate I’ve ever had” makes you think if he’d eaten plates before😂😂. I wouldn’t be surprised
I thought he was as holding a tree of dildos in the thumbnail lol
Great video! I believe these inventions can change the world!
send this to mrbeast !
Who is that girl in top 10th innovations . Face is edited.? Anyone noticed
This video restored my hope in humanity
This is the moment when I love people.
The top 3 inventions were sick!
14:45 mrbeast scammed us
From divine...to godly? 😂😂That's the same thing Arun
Anyone else notice that he said "21 of the most toxic tech fails" and pointed to the video that said 19?  No criticism Arun, I love you man!
16:20 thats what she said
I’m wanting to try out those beyond or impossible burgers sometime… I’m just hoping they don’t taste like the beyond meat I tried like 2 or 3 years ago.
mrwhostheboss can you do a video about futuristic clothes or shoes.
This is the best video you have ever done!
I don't know why I can't sub to this guy.
I really like your scoring! As far as I understand 5 or 6 is already pretty good so getting a 8+ is super hard.
Your voice is so calming... Love this video
Plastic Road.... I wish I invented that, haha genius
I need this dress! Can you send me?
Photoplankton makes 80 percent of oxygen, so trees are nice but the ocean is way more important
I will give you 1000000 to check under your table
You're amazing
8:29 seem to have a face cut and I think there is something about it.
The biotrem plates come plastic wrapped😂😂😂😂
Truth time, how many takes to grab those soap bottles??? Haha
Worms are going to eat our roads!
The poo paper is the least shitty idea ever(pun intended)
6:47 What you mean by that?
Plastic roadways have failed in concept
Why I am not getting any gift???.
I wanna know how the poo paper smells like
These are also some of my favourite videos!!! This series is literally SO awesome.  One place for correction though is that its pretty hotly debated whether or not stopping or reducing meat consuption actually has the impact that people think it does at all.  Check out the channel 'What Ive learned' for this, hes made a pretty in depth video regarding it.
I hate this video because it makes it seem like the comsumer is the problem. The person producing it should be held liable not the person using it. Most of these are SUPER expensive and just take the simplicity of something out of it.   It feels bad knowing you're using a plastic straw but its not really your fault
🤣👍👍😎
Hi
its soo good to see you introducing vegan products.
6:47 thats what she said
He said 21 toxic tech fails but in the thumbnail they are 19.
None of these inventions are great, because they need great resources, thay are more damageable  than HEAVENLY.
some ideas are nice, some ideas sound incredibly but they come at a cost that is so prohibitive that guarantees ... no implementation
number two " tree planting drones". A: its seeds not trees so 2/3rds wont germinate and at 50 cents a pop, 20,000 a day means that drone costs 10 grand a day to operate.  Is it also gold plating them ?
Dont abandon meat 🍖🍖🥓🥓
What a clever rickroll
How are you saving cows by not buying leather? Leather is a byproduct of the meat industry....
04:08 "that's what" what?
Expensive versace dress but i like it.
By the way is the fakon pork?
bro all of these products are great and amazing and i support all but why are they so expansive like the shower head 269dollars like if u r saving the world save us some money so we could save the world
I ma make a presentation to present to my school
Bran plates are wrapped in plastic.....
You'll know you love a YouTuber when you watch every second of even his sponsored content.
12.use bucket 😎
he said 50,000€ house is cheap, im trying to get my 3rd dollar over here
Is that a jojo reference???!!11!?
The vegan leather is fundamentally flawed, usually cows arent killed to extract the leather, we get food and leather as a useful biproduct so if we stop using we would have to deal with it in another way like burning it or something.
these items are the ideal future
10:13 packaged in plastic
God Damn it, Arun always has to sneak a rickroll in one of his videos ;-;.
Stay away from the vegan crap. If you want to eat vegetarian food, don't eat ultra-processed plant oils that mimics meat.
this just blows my mind
Would be nice to give links to certain campaigns like the drone trees for people that want to donate :)
I was drinking bubble tea while watching this video and when he said the alternative for straws was paper straw I immediately looked at my drink. 😂😂😂😂
Arun has the most click-baity thumbnails. Yet somehow it never ends up being clickbait at all.
.
I can't understandd if you're serious or it's just a joke, because most of these are quite stupid.
Who is she @ 8:27 ?? 🤣
Why not just ban paper. It will save 35 % of trees cut down in the world, we can shift study and office work on computers plus it would sound way cooler if aliens ever visited us
50,000 Euros can get you a mansion in Burma.
You said they just passed 30mil but it was 30 bil as per the counter in the screen
the ecocapsule looks like a mini version on gokus house from the outside
Decent video but as with most things, there is so much more behind things. The mealworms thing sounds really promising but be very careful with comparing plant and animal proteins. There is no such thing as just one protein, animal proteins are easier to absorb and in therefore are multiple times more "effective" than plant based versions in general. There are exceptions to every rule of course but the whole narrative of plants is just as good as animals is not factual. The other part about the insane carbon footprint of animals is also greatly over hyped. All the animals in the world produce less carbon issues than just a 1/10th of the cars on the road. So maybe lets not blow that out of proportion to distract ourselves from the real issues.
13:50 Mrwhoistheboss: whats the one trusty classic planet-saving techniquw that we all know about? Me: Killing peaople Mrwhoistheboss: planting trees. Me: I need to see a doctor
Now I see the How the insta post was relevant
From when..... Female dresses 👗
huel uses too much plastic.
The pavegen concept is already in place in Japanese train stations
Thought he was just gonna be like *"Yeah, plant based water"*
Observed that mole on the face in the first 6 six seconds and can't unsee it anymore. Aaaaaaahhhhhhhh......!!!
bro rickrolled us at 7:10
Number 3 is so false companies that make papaer  and wood for every one tree they cut they plant like 3 to 4 to keep their business stable for long term
How does an algae purify air if they are inside containers?
I started posting videos recently.  Do you have any tips of how to grow?
Imagine if all of these inventions are used.. Even if it takes 20 years they will definitely save our planet
BTW man the Huel link isn't clickable for some reason I can copy-paste it on a laptop but I don't think that is possible on mobile phones (at least not on Android)
MrWhosetheJesus
I love this kind of videos, keep making them
Hiiii🖤
The sponsor link doesn't work
A very educational video, well very done Arun 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Reusable straws are disgusting...
jeSUS
Thanks I needed that after watching MAPs and Dream Stans on Twitter
after the invention of 0 you want to make all bank accounts have 0 balance, don't you?
Arun’s catching ability is getting mind blowing in each and every video!
But why is dressed like a Roman statesman?
number 21 is number 1
I like the idea of plant meat, but I’ll stick to good old normal meat.
Of course xiaomi made it here, they're everywhere
Don’t do that… Don’t give me hope.
team sea is pathetic. Because there asking for money to help the sea be clean, like Bruh just help the earth. Don't ask for money to help the earth that's called greed not helping. There is so many sites where people help the sea for 0 dollars that's called helping. Like do you want the turtles to live??.
Huel was in plastic bag 🙃
Where can I get that outfit??!!
I havent heard of most of them and knowing abt these and supporting as much as i could makes me really happy.  Also now we are going to pick a costume theme  for arun and that is exciting 🤩
The problem with all this eco-friendly thingy,they are so freaking expensive.
You put so much work into the theme of the video. The clouds are a good touch
Ayo my man siding with that vegan teacher!
“I can just yeet the box into the ground and it will break down and feed everything around it”🤣🤣🤣
Fot the part with the cows leather. Cows or pigs leather is usually the waste product of meet production. its fulle eco friendly becouse it is taken aut of slaughterhouse. The thing you shouldnt buy to save animals is furr. but leather is fully eco friendly, and has natural characteristics
This seems a little blasphemy🤔 I'm out.
16:20 thats what she said
Is the Huel bag recyclable ?
Man, I love these videos! :)
Thanks Arun ! the clear panels looks promising
Loved the thumbnail😂😂 it was so appealing
The mushroom box is gross. Don’t you think?
I want to know the research process for that poo paper!
Poo paper is a no go for me
Plastic Road is a bad idea lol. Asphalt is far more environmentally friendly. Everything else is legit
Love your videos!
This might be your best video yet! This gives me hope that we can change
Hope Restored.
I bet arun single handedly producing plastic waste equivalent to 10 average people..
Wow
Awesome 👌
Plates made to avoid plastic plates being used...wraps plates in plastic 🙄 makes sense
And you are saving me from complete boredom
11:54 - Piezoelectricity
I am tellin u That Vegan Teacher is so happy rtn
Paper can be made from almost any fiber honestly. We even have paper made from grass in our company.
İ can't find the huel link?
Nice video
I just wish I could give Arun a sub everytime he says something creative to make people subscribe!
Nah i will never become a vegan
I like your video because unlike other tech YouTube you provide all information about smartphone in points
10:09 covered in plastic*
I mean some of these are good ideas but most are pieces of crap that break easily or reduce the entire experience of using said product.
Love the costume bro 👌
I'm addicted to your videos
16:20 — That's what she said
Its refreshing to see Arun showing so much enthusiasm towards bio-friendly clean energy. He genuinely loves the inventions and enjoys ranting about them.
3:36 algaes arent plants
Awesome...💯  Thanks !!
You got me hooked at "restore your faith for humanity"
Disappointed he didn’t include Nuclear Power, but great vid nonetheless
50k euros buys me a luxurious apartment where i live
That's the only plate you've ever had, right Arun?
Looks more like Caesar😂
21 useful inventions in only 17 minutes of content so he doesn’t waste our time…..👏👏👏👏👏👏
Ecocapsule for two people? Big dogs in our country require cages bigger than that...
Smooth Rick Roll👏🏼
Ironic how the huel bag is made of plastic
If that absorbs all the ir and uv  hot buildings buildings would be a thing in the past, sunlight wouldn't be a harmful thing ever. Except for the fact that you would probably have to sterilise regularly. How awesome is that.
Go Vegan  !!    Over my cold Dead Body !!!!!
11:11
If you'd gone with the actual toga, by now you'd have already1 crossed the 10 mil mark and beyond withing minutes...  Ha (I'm kidding) I know this isn't *that* kinda channel and it actually has useful substantial stuff... Cheerio!
2:28 You obviously never lived close to a turbine
Plastic roads are the worst thing you can do for the environment, just imagine the amount of microplastics they will generate by the wear and tear alone. Don't believe me you should watch Thunderf00t's video about it. Can't believe people give this company just because they use the right buzzwords.
Please don't ever wear this dress again
Huel is like the matrix food. have all the nutrients we need, but not food lol
Nice Roman Outfit😂
How do you research for such a video ?
Christmas came early . Or late
Arun: This hotel like capsule only costs 50,000 euros! Thats one of the cheapest houses in the world.  Me who is not even allowed to buy 1.50$ of robux: Sad day to not have a job
ok
Being vegan is not healthy. The idea is caring for animals and putting their survival above your own health. Which is also kinda flawed, because they still get killed and even if you bought it it still wouldn't be your fault.
all of these sound terrible
Im gonna remember all of this to flex on clueless people. Thanks Aron❤
08:30 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I always watch your videos because of the way you pronounce English language. That's 👌 awesome.
♥♥♥♥♥♥
Btw 2.5 Gallons is 11.25 litres
Why couldn't you have put an actual functioning  link to the Huel products 🤔😑
Ehh... the toga was over-the-top
something about Model pie. Please. I only trust your channel. ❣️🇳🇵
Background music is amazing in intro
Youre such a joke. A lot of these are already in a different way a thing for years. Wow, an american found reusable straws. Wow, a wind powered powerbank, solar powered ones have been out for years. You do not try these products, your praising them as if they will actually have any impact, when you don't even know if a single one of these actually works
This is amazing. Some of it i don't even know.
We'll not talk about his outfit
The 2nd invention [that plants trees] is from a mark smt video [I forgot f]
Mrwhostheboss ,everyone's favourite dictionary
Just the first couple minutes of this video are giving me hope for the world, especially after spending so much time worrying about climate change and things like that.   I really hope these environmentally friendly products become mainstream in the near future.
This video has restored my faith in humanity 🙏
Man is still wearing Teamseas jacket when out of costume, that's called being a true sigma
Theres nothing in the description of the video. At least address it in the pinned comment
plastic roads?not bad just not in australia.
( :
That facon would be halal ?
I can confirm. Huel T-Shirts are dope
In the new Audi A3 the seat fabric is also made oft PET Bottles.
Question - what's wrong with simple paper plates? Paper is made from wood, which comes from trees. Trees can be regrown. If forests are getting smaller, that's not a problem of consumption, that's a problem of failing to regrow forests. I don't care a lot about eco friendly stuff, but I do like self sustainment in terms of self grown food at home and electricity that's generated at home, as either a cost saver or in case I was to lose electricity, grocery stores ran out of food, etc.
As a prosthetic leg user I'm really looking forwards to floors that move underfoot unbalancing me and sucking away the energy I put into walking. There's no such thing as free energy. BTW clothes have been made from recycled plastic for at least the last 10 years. The plastic they shed when washed is already a microplastic pollution source.
I'm starting a petition to have Arun do ALL his videos in this beautiful ancient Greek tunic 😁
O
A man eating a plate and Fakecon and this 10:45
Plastic is biodegradable now a bacteria was found at a recycling plant that can break down plastic naturally scientists are trying to make the process faster
Huel link is not clickable
For the last one, if transparent solar only lets in light humans can see, doesn’t that mean every other animal would be screwed, what if you have a pet, it would barely be able to see since many animals including dogs and cats see uv light and you’re blocking that all away. And you can’t just choose to let in certain light, because you’re getting less power when if you have a pet you’re more likely to need more power.
The "Cloud Storage" got my like immediately
been on the channel for more than a year now and this was my only tech channel it wasn't until recently that i checked other famous tech channels and found out how boring can a tech video be! but your videos are so packed with information and so well paced that they might as well be too good to be to true perfect keep... nay top it up!
4.08       *...she said
Should put a list of each one of these on the description so people can go check them out
ARUN:- SAYS 21 TECH FAILS ALSO ARUN:- POINTS AT VIDEO THAT CLEARLY SAYS 19 TECH FAILS 🤣🤣🤣
haha he's wearing the ring from the other video
About the gosun fiuson people cook with coal because of the flavor it gives so its not so great for me coal the smoke is what gives flavor
Was that edible plate wrapped in plastic?
This man deserves way more subscribers than Marcus Brownlee
Funniest thumbnail ever
Sorry but most of these tips are just dumb
I love the 🚿 shawer thing so much but i cant buy it because i am very poor :(
but can you eat the mushroom box 🤨🤨
The plates are covered with plastic lol.
8:26
I really missed your videos Arun❤️❤️
I'm just here to appreciate the amount of time and research done by Arun to produce this.
men i love the effort u put for the videos come to life.  Big 10/10 for you
You never disappoint man.
Isn’t the “SUICIDE CAPSULE” Heavenly ?  We’ll you might end up in Heaven tho 😂😂😂
I love your approach to tech videos, They're literally having content people can't leave midway. Love mrwhosetheboss
i honestly love the transparent solar panel idea
I'm sorry but that eco capaule is not a home.
What type of facon was in the video?
00:16 : Repreve 00:56 : Soapbottle 01:35 : Mushroom Packaging 02:08 : Wind Tree System 02:31 : Biohybrid Chandelier 03:05 : Biohybrid Buildings 03:37 : Zstraw 04:26 : Facon 05:04 : Vegan Leather 05:48 : Nebia Moen 06:50 : Poo Paper  TOP 10 07:42 : Shine 08:26 : Gosun Fusion 09:12 : Ecocapsule 09:52 : Biotrem 10:59 : Air Ink 11:27 : Pavegen 12:14 : Plasticroad 12:57 : Mealworms 13:50 : Tree Planting Drones 14:47 : Transparent Solar
that self sustaining home would be a great camper trailer! especially if it is being hauled by an electric vehicle as the solar panels and windmill would also help charge the truck and the truck would have its own solar panels to both charge the truck and power the camper. or it could have a basic gas/diesel truck (for example a 2018 dodge ram 3500 dually which has a 6.7l turbo diesel which can haul it no problem with a staggering 31,210 lbs as thats what the 3500 is ment for, hauling large objects) where it wont be as enviromentaly friendly but the truck could still have solar panels and wont lose any power charging the camper and its a more modern truck so its less hard on gas. edit: the wind from driving the self sustaining home around would spool up the wind turbine so it can charge as you drive!
Hey
I tweeted to you account and also on messenger, about possible scammer using your videos. But you didn’t respond..
top tier informative videos as always 👏
While I can see the novelty of having algae in a chandelier, the idea of a building being surrounded by hundreds of gallons of ooze gives me concerns for maintenance and problems arising from leaks after so many years. When those tanks start leaking, it's going to be a toxic smelly mess.
He picks a wardrobe first and asks “What tech video would fit this costume?” 😁
2:20 Why not just plant real trees to save the environment?
America should just build roads like Rome instead of making plastic ones lol!
By prime by Logan paul and ksi
People say that we need to stop flying, but, having a child gives the same amount of carbon dioxide as 1000 trips to Paris from London.
How the Bio-hybrid chandelier and building purify air when the alage is covered with glass?  (Edit:- just a grammatical error)
still would be better to reduce human population to under 2.5 billion and send everyone else to a space habitat
Thanks!
Are you secretly telling us ur Jesus
Hahahaha so so creative 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Loved to see people like you promoting to save our environment 🙏🏻❤️
I am astonished to see the level of editing and your efforts in the video
But sadly most of these solutions especially the godly tear ones are hard to get because it's way expensive. I wish I could have them but sadly I can't.
Ur epic
thats dress looks comfortable but uncomfortable at the same time  next video related to games
Everything just is better and even perfect... From the theme, message and the overall script ... I love that Arun has come this far.... Keep it up bro... Always informative. :-)
was i the only one that noticed the ''thats what she said'' exept it was just ''thats what''  at 4:00. he forgot the rest
I'm an environmental engineer and pavegen was my final year project.
Actually the Roman wardrobe fits you very well! 😍
Great video😇😇😇
@thunderf00t should see this😂😂
Hi
21 second long unskippable ads disturbing 21 times in the vdo describing 21 heavenly inventions
I mean I just found out about those wind tree just last week for my university thesis 😅
Nice outfit
I geniuenly was watching ur channel for your 'SMARTPHONE REVIEWS' and "GADGETS' but with this video i think you are stepping up your game for 2022. Well done Arun!!
All these eco friendly gadgets are amazing, but its sad that most of them are quite expensive
How many ads am I supposed to watch in a 17 minute video ?? YouTube sucks when it comes to ads
I'd sit behind a normal glass with the sun in front, on a cold winter day, rather than sitting behind this solar glass, with no heat reaching me, and using the same energy to power heating apparatus instead.
Anybody who notices he literally doesn't mention sponsor even once in the whole video until the end and even mentions it as 'sponsored content' and he is literally respecting us and also leaving us an option to click off the video just by noticing it
I love your content
who's still here in 2023, edit: 1 year later
It's the heavenly outfit for me 😜
*Cow leather is already a waste product, its use does not harm anything.* So it makes no sense to waste the leather and generate carbon emissions to burn it while wasting even more additional energy and generating even more carbon emissions to produce the fake leather. Most other inventions are also dubious.
Just wait china make this kind of 'invention' they can make it cheap and affordable for 3rd world country
He says a sub to the channel would be angelic and I literally get the hello moto punch on the face ad and they say perfect occurings never exists 😂👊
I always love these videos because i end up taking a lot of time just to research these for myself and i have to say that i am extremely impressed that there is still a side of humanity that does in fact out in such an effort to fix how we do things
When I watch each of your video I think how you gather a lot information,when I try it takes me more than an month thanks to you and your team And one more I am your sub from 50K
Ironically, Jesus probably did look more like Mr Whose the boss than what you see in most churches lol
It’s honestly really reassuring to see some of these
7:10 here we go again :)) anyways, loved the way you focused on environment ! This is the video what we call the boss of the videos like Mr-this-is-the-boss
God's gift... Like cancer. 🙃
I was sad, because i thought this was the video without Milo, But at the End
AYO LOVE YOUR VIDEOS MAN WOOOO keep it up Mrwhosetheboss!
Dope thumbnail
Can somebody mention the link for the hoodie he was holding in the beginning
These are all amazing! I wonder if you'd like to explore a few inventions that could save our oceans too, as said in "seaspiracy", without our oceans, our planet will die!
I know someone who is a lead engineer at the biohybrid buildings section :D so cool it's in this video
forget huel it's time to get prime
Too many ads...20 seconds ..cant skip and so many times I b your videos 😑😑 So annoying
cool outfit!
Going vegan definitely isn't healthy
the bite in the a in eat at 10:34 is a nice detail you put a lot effort in to this. :)
Mr beast fans would be dumb if they thought Arun dint include team seas
Heavenly video! By the way, is nobody gonna talk about the fact that at 17:24 he said 21 toxic tech fails instead of 19 toxic tech fails?
FFS stick to tech
ooooooh god this dude rickrolls me sooo many times
Mrwhosetheboss with those OP Thumbnails!
17:23 those are 19 not 21. Thank you.
Love you man💕💕💕
Plastic roads sounds amazing, then you remember how slippery plastic gets when wet.
Brilliant, Superb, Well done, God Bless you, You have given a very big lesson through your this video to this planet bipadel animals.   This videos really works.  I am no a big fan of yours now rather than earlier videos.
i have those worms in my house
Mrwhosethegod
Didnt know u guys had chatime
Okay, but what are you wearing mate?😅
He really Rick rolled us with poo paper 😂😭
Hemp would literally solve all of the paper related issues we have. It can even be made into string, clothing, and some plastics. The only reason it isn't used is because its in the same family as marijuana and government is like WeEd BaD bAn AlL tHiNgS rEmOtElY rElAtEd To It!!!! And also big tree and textile don't want it.
Nice
Promising start but products usability felt apart until the end of the video.
22 inventions.. Number 22 is your cape. ;)
Yo ns
Imagine walking into a room in your house and seeing your husband show off clothes while dressed as Jesus
Each to their own, but that Facon looks terrible.
i would never buy poo paper it's just weird like I think we can find paper that doesn't need trees poo
Love how most of the products here designed to replace plastic are packaged in plastic 💀
love the vid
I have allergy to peas and chick peas and trust me lots of this is used in Vegan food.  Further more pea fibre or protein by companies looking for cheaper protein substitutes. I constantly have to check for recipe changes. I hate too many trips to A & E and sick of seeing intensive care.
What a costume 😜
very informative, like, very,
For the fake leather thing people who work in slaughter houses still need to kill cows for food so either way they would be killed
He's video is an experience you enjoy ❤️
so r u tech?
Poo paper from 🇱🇰 is a genius concept ❤️
T-shirt😍
I believe all of the inventions are 10/10
Love the videos but this was too much cringe for me
BIOTREM plates wrapped in plastic 😆😂
Poo astley
HOW DID THAT PINEAPPLE NOT HURT HIS HANDS?!?!
Top tier info as always
Arun wearing a toga is everything
Great
Let's talk about your outfit😂
🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳❤
is that a wedding ring in his hand
Hey Arun be careful while making these kind of videos who knows that one of these tech might actually be a huge scam or fraud, especially if it comes from kickstarter stuff
LoL outfit🤣
now this is a GOD MOMENT
IF the drone can plant 20,000 trees per day and each tree is 50 cents then that means that it is $10,000 per day!
"This invention is outstandingly amazing and is going to literally end climate change and littering and save the planet and save the animals and save the whales and get every single piece of plastic out of the ocean and save the sea turtles and end world hunger and end poverty and end war forever and cause everything that has ever been bad to just no longer happen ever again because of this invention. 2 out of 10"
The barbecue gadget, when armenians hear about it: **sold out**
Wow. I enjoyed this one as well as learning a lot of things.
Jesus Christ loves you all <3
I'm a bit suspicious about the soap bottle, no one seems to actually have the product or a review from a legit youtuber and not just a corporate promotion video, is it another scam or this thing actually exists??
The ink pen would go out of business because we are trying to get ride of there source
Please please give me an iPhone please.
Bro is it just me or do I also get a smile on my face and some happy tears when I hear that music at the end when talking about some stuff to help save the Earth
a thousand glasses of water actually does not take up that much space at all,  keep in mind you just need a cube of 10 x 10 x 10 glasses, which would not quite fill up the room I'm in 😅
Finally some good news
Top tier Costume 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤣😆😂👍
Did you notice that in 8:29.
The term:"finish your plate" just got a new meaning 😆
You are from Great Britain, for Gods sake, please use metric system: 2.5 gallons, what is that in litters per seconds per camels?
Mr whose the caeser 😅
His girlfriend is @ 8:30
But like the lumber industry is good for the planet… they replant every tree they cut, it wouldn’t make sense to run a business by ridding the planet of the resource. Other than that good video!
I LOVE YOU
I shot a hog
9:09 ok i will " i am telling u that is not a bright idea"🥴
Ouuuuu the costume tho
🇮🇳🇮🇱👍🏻
10:09 I hope that isn't a plastic wrap lol
So we shouldn't use plastic anymore and instead cut down the trees that we breathe from and make paper straws and cutlery????
the editing and the background changing elevates the quality of the video by a huge amouny
Why did u removed the video  ‘how technology can kill you video 'plz post it again I was ganna watch it now but then I see this video. Plz post it back
Apple is godly ngl
The music is awkward and distributing
Elephant shit paper spitballs anyone?
Won't the transparent solar panels block 4g and 5g signals? The way you describe it is that it will only let in visible light, and 4G and 5G waves are also actually light so won't the signal drop massively?
elephant poop cardboard is a very old thing. making it into paper is nothing new I'd say
Community : You know no one can come up with more than 10 types or rickrolling techniques Arun : Hold my beer
man really turn into zeus
Dude I loved this concept and it's amazing what companies are doing....but your pronunciation "Algae" gets me cracking 😂😂😂
4:08 Anyone else noticed the "that's what"... she said
Ares is that you...🧐
Arun,  How many times so far in life, have you taken bath in Lakes, Ponds, River Streams, Waterfalls and Rain ?  Earth Is Mightiest Of Them All, I LOVE.
0:53 Good One.
Love the dressing it really restores hope
I loved all of those
When you are the one that changes the likes from 65k to 66k:
This video just gave us hope that humanity could last forever ❤
But the best thing you can do is keep using stuff we already have, and wait until those new stuff goes cheaper when it's sppread.
Just remembered all this Jesus Christ outfit in movies
That tree you photoshoped is done very poorly
wtf is a gallon
literally paper made out of shit to wipe shit
Can anybody link to the company that can plant 20k trees a day with 1 drone... Very impressive speed of 13.8 trees per second. I will donate 5k dollars to arbor foundation if true. Unless its just tree seed which could be spread by hand as well....
Thanks God someone taking environmental issues seriously
Real life parents:so I'm not efficient 😒
RIP huel link
Okay so that shower head seems pretty cool and all, but like  I may or may not use my detachable shower head to... yes.
So the plates come covered with plastic. 🤨🤨 hmmm.....
From what I know, no. 9 doesn't work. I saw a review and it didn't work as intended
ok just to let u know all the topic has nothing to do with God leave God out of this I don't think that nice
As always: well made, funny, interessant . More please
Man just goes: hmm this outfit looks good for a tech video
Omg Arun went all out!
"I am feeling wet just thinking about it" That’s what she said..🐷
I rarely like videos but the top 3 alone deserved it.
an youtube video with really some awesome YOUTUBE content..!!
Cutie 😜😜
the problem is: If use plastic, it could end up in beaches, seas or even animals. If use paper, its destroying trees!
"21 HEAVENLY Inventions to save the WORLD" Oh and yeah our sponsor comes in a plastic bag and the bottle is made up of plastic!
Lol.
omg i never new any of these could exist
@mrwhosetheboss please can you make more videos I have nothing else to watch. I've been watching your old Videos.
A RickRoll at 7:13
10:55 "Still the tastiest plate that i've ever had"    ALSO THE FIRST PLATE YOU EVER HAD LOL 😂
Nice shoulder, Arun
Do a barfing inventions
Superb thumbnail, even better content.
No 7 Indians be like 😂😂
Bruh, this guy did a promotion of fuel company and said that they give a good tshirt free and is wearing the team seas tshirt                  I don't mean to sue team seas, keep it running
he sounds different >:(
Are elephants getting paid for their sh*ts?
From 0:00 to 17:34, every single second of this brought up my faith in humanity and brightened my day
I'm watching this video at 4 Hours of its Upload and 4.4 Lakh Views and 4K Comments 🥺😳... LITERALLY ANGELIC 4:4:4:4 👼
Number 2 got my attention 💙
So i dont know much about plastic but I thought one of the main concerns of plastic on a health level is also microplastics shedding and getting into our bodies or the environment. Wouldnt the plastic shirts and plastics roads still have this personal health and environmental related issue?
5x more efficient = 5x more expensive
Divine is the same as godly, no?
After a long time♥️
Fun fact: he is wearing a copy of Jesus's Outfit 😂
Haven't looked into that specific company yet, but every other time I've seen "vegan leather" it's just been plastic, which ends up being way wotse for the environment than just getting the actual leather version.
WHAT IF all governments ban producing plastic then all companies will be forced to recycle plastic.I know you are not going to see this comment but WHAT IF you see this🤔
Why is Rick Astley in every video?
Finally an anti-mars video, Elooon Musk not happy
The outfit is... heavenly
repreve : exist mrbeast fans : no NO NOOOO
I have a small road nearby made of solar panels and its a pretty good invention but.. they are behind trees so its kinda useless
6:47 Ayoooo
i rate everything 200/20
So much awesome stuff! Thanks Heavenly Emperor Arun (:
14:59 SUUSSS!1!!11!!!😳
(7:00) i heard about this from a nas daily video :)
The problem with plastic roads is that micro plastic ends up ground water
9:53 that move was smooooth asf
Who else came here to see clouds in the room
I don't understand why they are always trying to copy the meat versions of food. Why they just use new recipes for vegan foods. Maybe people won't be making fun of them.
Me thinks, some of this inventions needs debunking. Thunderf00t, where are you? :)
But instead of throwing away your plates gust wash them
5:35 - 'it's not just you're saving the animals' - you're not, every single one of them will be slaughtered.  Kind of makes redundant reducing emissions if your going to save them.
Humanity is indeed still alive. Faith restored! 🔥
That ecocapsule looks like something straight out of dragon ball lmao
Arun,  Instead Of Clothes, I Prefer Getting Them Made Into Camping Tents, Sleeping Bags, Explorers and Adventurers Edition.
17:11 I feel this would be the next meal for astronauts in Outer space
Why dont you just have rankings of your own (so from 20  -  1 ) and dont do ratings beacuse most of these are super creative and deserve more than 2/10.
vegan teacher will be very proud lol
Very informative with awesome  editing.👌
smartphone gadgets next please?
Xiaomi: Let’s send some new tech to Mrwhosetheboss. Mrwhosetheboss: I love this PACKAGING. Xiaomi: Why are we here, just to suffer?!?
The eatable plate is best idea if I had hungry and searching for food I can now just eat the plate XD       Just a joke
Bro he literally talks about getting rid of plastic and the huel bag is made of plastic 😂
Hey bro your huel link isn’t working
Use the Wii’s soundtrack in your next video
You getting some really Amazing little things that really can make a difference in saving earth !
When A run does a video about planet saving inventions and then shows a sponsor that has a black plastic bag ;)
I would rate the drones at 1st place.
this is your best video and your so happy i love it
I need what u wear in this vid bro...send me a link 😂
Wow! Got rickrolled by Poo paper.... Better luck next time (^^)
Hey Arun instead of burning coal In a barbecue use mango tree wood instead it helps purify air when burnt with clarified butter
Dude... plastic roads have been debunked sooo many times. It is NOT a suitable replacement for pavement for vehicles. The only saving grace is it appeared they were using this for pedestrian walkways, in between 2 paved roadways, which could work.
6:48 wait , what!!!
10:16 Kinda ironic that a plate made out of wheat to reduce plastic use, is wrapped in... plastic
He is dressed like Jesus
As a Greek, I'm flattered that one of the most enjoyable content creators, tried dressing up as a god for a vid. These inventions are truly godly leveled
if you make a healthiest inventions video you should mention Air up bottles
22.. you forgot to include that shirt.
- *”That vegan teacher”* approves of this video.
I love your content but I must say that plasticroad seems like a returning scam from about 4 years ago I'm a civil engineer and we already debunked this scam in a science paper Plastic is one of the worst material to make roads for many reasons is not cost effective is not durable it's difficult to give maintenance I hope you can check a little more information for that one a don't promote solutions that are actually worst that what we currently have   Best regards
When i think about the fact that this video is a Top 10 format makes me rethink about the world
Am I the only one who had to rewatch the entire video because I was just watching the FACON progress meter?
What is this thumbnail? 😂😂
The world is being saved right under our noses, right now
Poo paper has existed for so many years, i still own a box which i bought in SriLanka in 2006-7 probably. It is not a great solution, pretty sure the paper usage has severely gone down since 2020 cuz of rapid digitalization.  Great video tho
Let's take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into the content for us ❤❤.
Arun Chirst is not real , he won't love you. Arun Christ :
In simple words “our future is bright” ❤️
If you care about the future then just go vegan, it's the easiest and simplest way to reduce your impact on the environment.
Not to vegan is nothing to do with bacon but more to do with humans being omnivores and needing the nutrients meat supplies, whatever crock of shizzle a minority come out with the shove their way of life on to you.
Hey does je have a tattoo?
THE WAY HE EXPLAINS EVERYTHING HE SHOULD BE MY UNI PROFESSOR
Please do a follow up video on how most of these dont functionally work well.
THE WAY HE SAYS BRILLIANT IN HIS BRITISH ACCENT IS JUST BRILLIANT
Everything good with top 1 until you realize that the effectivity of an actual solar panel is about 11-15%, so... 50% of that.... Mmm... Not enough to solve mayor problems. Incredible though
Man the costume was out of this world
Arun, Listen, The Process of Paper Making, Is, Collecting Leaves, Barks, Branches and Stems of Trees,  Grounding Them Into A Pulp, Processing with Additives To Bleach Them, That Gives Us Rolls (Scrolls) of White Paper.  Elephants, Actually, Process This Every Day, Free From Chemicals and Toxins.  Several Humans, Consider The Process of Normal Digestion In Any Living Being To Be Gross,  And That's Where, We Have Our Problem Statement.  Life of Mothers', Nurses', Doctors',  and Animals', How Do They Clean and Tend To Their Younger Ones or Mates !?   Have You Seen Simba and Milo, Their Grooming Routine !?  Except Humans, All Animals Lick Their Wounds, And This I Say, Not A Joke,  Yet, We Eat Them, As Meat,  Why Is That So !?
16:50 behind the laugh though...😁
Windtree "leaves"..... Right......
Pavegen was designed by an ex-student from my school
50,000 euros for a tiny pod? My two room apartment, all of the renovation done to it and all of the furniture I bought for it was 67k, and I don't need an app for it that might one day stop being supported. That eco "home" is a scam.
1:06 "SURE" buddy!!! LoL
3:10 did he mean algae? Ive always pronounced it as al-g
Probably the best video yet... ❤️
Looking great ❤️
You've heard about it he helicopter parent. Now get ready for the latest invention in nursery technology: The drone parent
respect arun efforts 🤧
Keep up with the useful tech videos arun!!! 🙌
Gonna show this video in my next science exhibition ...😁😁😍
I kinda had the idea transparent solar panels that we can put on buildings when I was a kid
We want the OnePlus 10 review
we all must somehow contribute something to this world.........
Please make more videos like these videos'
What is the Sharelink for Huel with the bottle. If you click on the link provided they don’t offer your deal.
If that invisible solar works then that would be the most revolutionary invention yet... But we might have to wait a few years....
Mr boss, seriously? the animals will be killed either way, for beef, we have to maintain the eco system, otherwise we will be fighting for the greens with the same animals. that vegan lifestyle is a hoax so are the said "advantages"  to environment
Owsm video👌👌👌👌
Your outfit ❤💯
8:26 is she she ?
🤓Ur dress : 04/10
I love these videos, I keep a look out for the cool things I'm into to eventually purchase
We got rickrolled again
him wearing Jesus is hilarious
Dude, you get a like for that top. Nah but seriously well done for making this topic
Everyone is talking about the inventions but they are ignoring the dress code of Mrwhosetheboss :')
Mom : Don't you go to bed eat your plate first
6:16 if you wanna save water just start taking cold showers, you won’t stay in as long trust me lol
If it wasn't for YouTube, Arun would be a scientist 😂
Thank you so much these high quality content, that too for free.. thank you so much. I've been supporting this channel for years, seen you grow, seen you improve. You are a motivation. 👍
Just bought a notebook from Elecosy! Sounds awesome, and potentially stinky? lol
Not a bright idea  You told me to say it
Aron, where’s Huel Link?
If you say anything to this man he can make it to a pun bro
fake bacon is gay
I only have one problem with one of the inventions. I have coeliac disease, and so for number 7, the plate (because it contains wheat and bran (and therefore gluten)) would make me very ill if i ate it/ ate food off it. Apart from that great video
Love your cosplay as Zeus all u need now is the lighting
4:05 that's what she said
video was cool and informative but the voice was a bit low
lol I actually have tried Huel because I recently got braces! I would say that it is nice but very sweet, you can't drink it all at once.
Anything vegan is an automatic no.
About that straw, whose gonna be carrying it around ? i literally forget my wallet almost 3 times a week. that place should have been taken by the soap container
W
Your environment focused series are so inspiring and heartwarming Thanks
I was kinda hoping of the Czech whater mashine that can make whater out of air but still some awesome ideas 😂
The soapbottle is clever, but I just see myself continuing with my solid shampoo and conditioner bars.
Package from xiaomi... 🤔 Could it be the mi 12 😬
I think he knows that the crown he is wearing is also plastic
Why would I be eating my plate , what if I ran out of plate
Plastic roads wasn't a scam?
Vegans crave meat so badly that theyll go to any length to replicate it, but we don’t need meat, right…
There's no way was under 20 minutes!! I had a million truly pleasant thoughts thanks to you. Superb video Arun👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
noooo i got rickrolled fron the paper
Glad to see your videos again. For the first time,  You looked tired in some of those parts of this video. Hope you are doing well.
AAHHH MY DAD WORKS AT ARUP 🤣🤣
8:29 The "Aruna" cutout was a nice and hilarious touch. Great job editor
Advertising team seas while the sponser was good. I just noticed it at the end when you told the you can get a free tshirt.
The problem with plastic road is that plastic enters the air when someone drives on them
I think Arun makes a new video depending on the new word for subscribing 🤣
By the way i like the way you wear 😂😂
love your brit accent
As long as the clothes are cheap I'll buy them. But I won't pay more. Same with the soap. The stuff has to be the same price or less than the "bad" stuff. Same with all the rest of it.
Arun,  Elephant Dung, and For that matter, Every Species Dung,  Poo, Is About, Giving Back To The Planet, Very Delicious 😆 and Nutrient Rich 😂, For the Soil.  Did you know,  Which Manure (Dung) Is Good for Potatoes and Sugarcane !?  Now I Sound Like MunDUNGus Fletcher😨
4:58 as a Muslim person I can finally eat bacon
4:30 I wouldn't really say that vegan food is better for health tho
Can you do another episode for the  phone gadgets series. I really love them. I want to buy all of them. But i could only get like 2 of them. Thanks for the amazing video
These are all 10/10       Except the vegan one 😂
Huel comes in a plastic bag😒
Requesting to that 400k people who will be his subscribers in future to subscribe him as soon as possible  My fav youtuber gonna cross 10 million soon 🙏
Papers are made out of tree And write on the paper DO NOT CUT TREE🥴weird
1st Vegan/Vegetarian fiesta just aren’t it yet for me (at least as a foodie) 2nd: Vegan leather is TOTAL GARBAGE
Love this video, easily my favorite invention videos you have made 😊😊
Hey Arun,  Amazing Video as always!! Just wanted to give a Feedback. Could you please lower your background music.. it gets too noisy and your voice is not clear and audible.  Thanks for such Super Duper Amazing Videos!! Stay Safe!! 🌟🤗❤️ Have a great day!!
I can already see the headlines  "Man eats Xiaomi mushroom packaging, sent to hospital"
7:05 in Sri Lanka they collected elephants poop and made them clean paper
Arun been watching you before u even hit 1 million   U make my frickin day  Luv u
This is one of the best videos I have ever watched on solutions to real-world problems! Thank you Arun, you literally saved my project without even knowing it!
2:17 my god, looks like the Lorax
Where is the link for huel
Your dress is kinda weird 😅
Ok European plastic road is genius 👏 👌 but the idea was definitely from India's Rajagopalan Vasudevan Sir's plastic in bitumen concept.
Milk
I like poo paper, we should do more that
He rick rolls us in every video WHAT THE HECK 🤣🤣🤣
Watching the Nebia part. Oeh.. interesting! €277!!! I'll stick with my 1000 glasses =(
Solve the world's plastic problem with mealworms in just a few months. Yeah no...
I think your rating scale doesn't do justice in this video concept.
amazing video, watching this while hacking the white house
This might be the best GREEN video on the internet 😀 Love your work sir.. Information and entertainment in a single video.. ❤️❤️❤️ 1 question though.. who's the girl in 8:27  The static image of a girl.. You wouldn't do that in purpose 😉..
Plastic pavement has been debunked repeatedly. Plastic takes a long time to break down, but walking on it shaves it into microscopic pieces easily. Asphalt is actually infinitely more recyclable and is also mostly already made.
Huel is available in Bangladesh? 🤔
Do more homework.. electric floor generators are stupidly inefficient
"Mmmm smokey, meaty and greasy just like real bacon!" -Said No Real Vegan Ever
Who all are after 400k views ??
Freitag ,a swiss company, that makes backpacks, messenger bags and more from used truck tarpaulin would have fit really well into this video.
0:37 mr beast & da fish would be proud
30 billion pieces of trash is a big number until you realize that there's 5 trillion pieces of macro plastic in the ocean
I have no faith in humans, in fact I hate humans, Filled  with jealousy and hate , they say words that can put you so low that you no long want to be alive and they fight and swear at you for the most pathetic thing and why is there so much crackheads and the cancel culture just why are humans like that , I wish we could destroy the bad people or separate Earth in to  two sides  .  I can say I hate humans  with a passion . The way things is now it’s better if we go extinct and hate online needs to stop just because you’re face is Hidden you don’t need to trash Talk someone so much that they take there own life away…  any way I’m only one in billions I can’t change anything . ( this comment has nothing to do with this video in a way, I just wanted to take away the pain I feel towards the subject of humans) as someone once said to me there’s more Bad  than good
Creative dressing always
This video is the proof that solutions to human problems are solved by private inventions and no by the government
amazing as always
Those leaves lookin kinda sus
Nice
The bacon timer was a really good idea
0:31 not a good taste in design btw !
Are you a Muslim please tell me
Sure…and in the meantime Lufthansa made 18k YES 18 thousand empty flights….not to loose airport slots!!
The last mrwhosethebss video will be when the dictionary runs out of words.
the plastic reuse inventions are dumb, its just more excuses that companies can use to keep producing plastic, the road is even dummer, ah yes lets introduce plastic to roads and create tons of microplastics. Anything that doesnt stop the production of plastic aint helping the planet its doing more harm than good
Pig is the most shameful animal on earth
aron is black British Jesus confirmed
Im going to become an investor after watching this video 😂
This is insane, love it
Unbelievable video content quality as always!
4:08 knew Arun would make the that's what she said reference
Ok Arun, "that's what" at 4:09 was nasty this time.
The recycled clothes intiative is a good one. But the cloth made from it totally non-recyclable.
Arun be like :- Kneel before jesus
I just feel humanity is restored after watching this video.
Vegan teacher taking notes right now But tbh this is a great way to make someone vegan or environmentally cautious great job Aron
I really hope this video is not putting tgt without any research The reason most of the product in the video is not common because how less effective but high cost to do their job done/ save environment The truth is most of these products is actually made just to advertise people to spend more money on buying the product rather than actually helping the environment
These type of videos make people actually think for a second and really care for our environment. Good work mate .
How much ever informative fun these videos are, the Rick rolls man. It always get me..
Anyone gonna talk about that airink pen being made out of plastic
"Humanity restored"
What's Arun wearing 😁, love the robe though
I think an island theme would be cool
Nice dress
If he added one more invention, it would've been "22" inventions in the year 2022, or maybe its just a delayed video for the end of the previous yeat
10:59 hey I kinda worked on air ink
Your just awesome man love you ❤️
Restored my faith in humanity
They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen. Romans 1:25
Welcome to Jesus tech reviews
Love the environment friendly theme 🥰
The vegan teacher : Trying to make a reaction video to this and then end up not finding any X’s on you  Me : laughing 😂
GOD gave people good brains but too many get used to produce worthless.
Lol
If there's one thing I've learned from this video is that we could save Earth if we wanted to but we just don't
That jacket looks like something out of the 90's.  Btw what's the occasion for the outfit?
Lol awsum video. I am feeling wet thinking about it in shower . Tell me its not a  bright idea.still the tastiest plate I ever had. lolol your one liners are always goofy and enjoyable.
Best series ever
You have literally changed the definition of a Tech Channel 🙌
Day one: can I plz have a iphone 13 pro max 1tb graphite,airpods pro and an apple watch plz daddy😋✌️
I love your videos
Kardashians better run better run outrun my worms
Really loved this
Those biohybrid things are so cool, don't think they will be adopted soon but if they do that would be so good
I watched 4 ads to finish this video 😭
10mil here we come
For your information the suit you are wearing is not from Jesus Christ it’s from the Roman emperor’s 😬😬😬😬😬😬😬😬
FOR ME NUMBER 5 PAVEGEN WAS THE MOST INTERSTING 🤔🤯🤯
Mrzeustheboss
Lovely video mate. We need more stuff like these
Liar
25 minute shower? Yeah no my parents raisede in a 5 minute shower home haha
❤️
This increased my hope in humanity. 10/10 Video
Guys we get rickrolled
One of my favorite video of all time, loved your content sir.  PS: Attire was next level 😄
Wish all these things become the new normal It will change the world in a good way
This Is Probably The First Time He Sweared In A Video Hahaaa!😅
The HUEL bag is made of plastic
Majorly here for that greek attire🤪😜
2.07 y'all remember the lorax animation film? This reminds me of that
Me: mom can we have Julius Caesar  Mom:But we have Julius Caesar at         home Julius Caesar at home:
I love that he’s doing this like God (:
Dude1: "Ey bro I'm low on battery. You got a powerbrick?"   Dude2: "Hol up, let me set up the substation"
Yeah sorry but I need bacon no thanks on that vegan bacon I'll eat a impossible sausage or burger
The HUEL package is plastic ain't it?
very intersting und nice video✌
Im EARLY!! WOAAGAGAGAGA
isn't he Aurn of the best content creators in the world ?
Nice costumes
hey arun the huel link isn't in a clickable link form and is just in a text form.
Loved the video 🤟
That mushroom packaging from xiaomi is a cleaver idea. If it doesnot have much negetive side i think it can replace a lot of plastic for Packaging
U look ridiculous 🤣🤣🤣🤣
He literally rickrolls us every video 😭
🤌
This Glass Window Technology really deserves to be on the TOP.
Humanity Restored
The reason why wind and solar power is limited is because they take more energy to make than they produce. They also have a way to grow real meat from animal cells. Most people generally use glass plates, anyways.
Dude let's just appreciate the dedication he has to each and every video
I never knew how much I liked shoulders before I saw this video.
OK. So I have been going through withdrawal over here waiting on a video to be uploaded.  Now that you have done it I am fulfilled.  What a great video.  10 out of 10.
Even his Rickrolls are becoming organic
Great video.  But not sure Huel, who uses plastic packaging, was a relevant sponsor for a video that's all about the environment.  Unless they solely use recycled plastic? Not sure they do tho.
What a Divinefull atmosphere. Liked it👍
Your videos blow my mind, but are you hosting toga party? Time to get my toga on 👍
I love these kind of videos
WHAT THE HUEL'S PACKAGING MADE OF, ARUN??
It's super hero brooh!!!
Looks like arun finally found another use for his bedroom cosplay costumes
Nice to see that there's still some chance that I will die of old age
What if I’m allergic to peas
🎶Talk about your childhood wishes, you can even eat the dishes!🎶 -"The Candy Man" by Sammy Davis Jr., from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
"I'm feeling wet just thinking about it!" what do you mean by that? 🤨
4:07 that's what she said Lmao
No3- meal worms was thee best 💯 I hope this solution works
why are you jesus
Elephant dung paper is not so new here it is kind of common in my place.
Great video bro 😊😃
Algae are not plants
I’m probably the only one to think that but I hate the direction your channel’s taking. A lot of « top X », « Y facts about ». I think this is perfect for growth as people click on those video titles, but you were so much better at doing reviews.
Gotta say that your the only channel that I like every single video automatically
6:49 ngl I did expect one "that's what she said" pop-up when Arun said he's feeling wet just thinking about it 😂😂😂
So many cool eco-friendly things it almost frustrates me that none of these will ever be something even one percent of people use
Costume costume!!! Its suits you 🤣 kidding bro..
Arun,   Pineapple leaves, Camels, Elephants, Pigs and Most Herbivorous Animals Eat Them,   I seriously do not understand, why it is burned or even used for vegan(Humans are greedy, that they do not even want to Feed the Animals with Organic Natural Food) leather,   Look at the Bag or Accessories Industry,  The Market Is Piled With Goods,  High End Fashion, or Fake Fashion Products on the Streets or Bazaars.   Why does the Government and Policy Makers, Focus and Put, Too Much Energy Into MONEY and PROFITS !?
Most of those are dumb. For me mushroom packaging is the most sensible.
Yup! The clothes are.... divine
Mrwhosetheboss videos ar getting Eco-friendly.He is trying to get attention of ecosystem technology.That incredible Respect Legend 💯
This was the best of the series
Bruh v don't want to see ur shoulders
The last bit of the video was almost documentary level.. Awesome. 🙂🙂
I've never thought tech videos can make me feel emotions The top 3 accompanied by the seraphic bgm actually gave me feels, your videos feel like the equivalent of art pieces in museums, except they're easily viewed and understood!
And youre wearing godly garments😂i saw Rick Astley on that poo paper👀
14:42 yes a lot of trees but even if one tree costs 0.50 dolars in total to plant 20.000 trees a day will cost 10.000 dolars
6:46 mmmmmm very pg/child friendly xD
1:09 not really
TECH videos that restore your faith in humanity!
That thumbnail either scarred someones eyes or blessed them.
4:09 it says that’s what top left. Just if you didn’t see it
Hmm if he just made a heavenly  Im guessing the next will be hellesh 😐😐??
Good video bro. Just found this channel and I need to watch more of your vids, but this was was fantastic. Gives me lots of hope for humanity’s future :)
Can u make Video on the coolest AI Robots … available on market or that we can expect in few years ike EMO and others …. 😁
I thought he was gonna talk about the straws you could eat
These are absolutely brilliant!  However, I keep wondering why are these things not commercialized yet? Does it cost more than the average use of existing way. Or perhaps it hasn't because where I live...  Oh and the problem that I notice with the edible plate is that, plate are usually put on a table which is quite not hygienic.
Okay they're heavenly
That one minute see you tomorrow
Transparent solar cant be real. If it can stop all other wavelength of EMR, it will be able to act as a IR cloak. The military would coat everything in them to make infrared missile useless.
I was just thinking about when will I get another Mrwhosetheboss' new video... I got it!
idk why but this didnt come in my "subscriptions"
4:09 that's what she said lollol
I love your content, but the title made me check to make sure that it wasn't April.
I'm extremely offended that poop paper is not called the Shit sheet
Heaven - ily 😇💜
costume game on ppint..
I bet that fake plate tasted just the same as that fake bacon you made!
First "invention" is actually bad for the environment. When these clothes made from recycled plastic are washed they shed microplastic every time and they end up in the ocean again. Since these are super small, we cant even take them out of the sea using conventional methods
Where in the hell do you come up with these ideas, Arun? These thumbnails are a game changer.
Epson has built a printer which converts printed paper into white  paper which can be used again.
10:45 I think this company should make straw as well, they will sell billions
It is funny how u are wearing the leaves in all of the top 10 😂😂🙃🙃🙃 And u really put a lot of thought and effort for ur clothes , background,and script 👍👍😂😂😂
The Facon/Vegan Bacon took around 4 minutes and 53 seconds from 4:59 to 9:52 And yes I counted it.
he said 21 toxic fails at the end instead of 19  lol
9:17 That's just about the wost arrangement of solar panels I've ever seen. If the designers would've been less conserned with making the thing look like a jelly bean and thought about efficient solar panel placement, they might have gotten a bit more energy out of them and could've increased the size to more than a small bathroom... This one definetly falls into the category of "made-because-environmentalism-is-cool-right-now" and no further thinking went into it.
A bunch of these feel like all the others.... never going anywhere or a scam
I think  was interested in the costume more than the  inventions 😂
We don't use solar panels everywhere because they can be costly
Thanks for this immensely funny video, to keep the spirits high in a gloomy grey British afternoon!  Some afterthoughts. Plastic is highly successful because its prime constituent is very cheap and plentiful. Any attempt to recycle plastic will always be more expensive than making it from scratch. Some councils in continental Europe have commissioned recycling machines for plastic materials, doing automatically from sorting to melting, producing pellets for industrial use. Producing pellets with those machines costs from 10 to 100 times more than making them from crude oil, so they must sell them at a net loss. The solution to plastic recycling equate to: finding who pays for that loss. In the case of the Swiss municipality I mentioned, recycling is funded with council taxes and government contributions. Please bring back my plastic straws, thank you. The all fandango of carbon emissions from cows. The cows produce methane burps because of their diet. The addition of 5% algae to their food reduce their methane emissions to zero. The entire war against meat - targeting millions of family-run farms that produce meat, and replace them with few mega-structures producing "vegetable meat". The same protein gunk present in vegan sausages, produced by fungus in giant biological reactors, and fed with heat and sugar. The human body is designed to be fed with meat, and that vegan gunk is not a suitable replacement. For the class of gadgets that power themselves. Listen. The semi-permeable catalyst membranes that have been developed to power electric cars with hydrogen can easily be adapted to produce electricity with methanol or propane, without using platinum.  Now, imagine a nice fat D cell, that you fill with lighter gas, and produce full load electricity for 24 hours. Or a power bank you fill with methanol and it keeps your phone alive for days. These are not pipe dreams of mine; those applications of fuel cells are possible with current technology at acceptable market price.  But, if 20 W fuel cells can be built in the smartphones or other gadgets, why this millions dollar market is left untapped? I can't find an answer.  Once more, thanks for all the laughing today! Truly appreciated! Regards, Anthony
I feel like as long as cow meat products are produced leather from those cows should be too
Am I the only one who expected his costume to be an invention which will be discussed in the video?
Watching a roman god, being a "tech. geek" is so pleasing 😂🔥
When you wash plastic clothes they make microplastics
Always good content to watch Mrwhosetheboss
Did you all notice the plastic used for packaging at 10:09 ?
Mrwhosetheboss can you please review the Blu g91 pro I would love to see it.
14:46 At a price of JUST 50 cents per tree.. = $10,000 PER DAY!!!
Another idea to an upcoming fail video: Battlefield 2042!
Why is color grading so bad on parts of this video?
GODLY🔥
Bacon Haram. Facon better and Halal
Where is huel link?
This video is a scam most of these tech products are already canceled and are already been proven to not be good for the environment and then the three that was good for the environment you gave them a 4 out of 10 what a terrible YouTuber. Last but not least veganism is a scam they use just as much carbon emissions it's already been proven by multiple governments all vegan foods come from living animals or living plants which means veganism as a whole is a lie! And more studies have come out that vegans are actually less healthy than people with an actual balanced diet and working out most of the time so no becoming a vegan is going to kill you. And if you need any evidence that veganism is bad for your health just look at one American senator he's literally fat as hell he was skinnier when he was eating steaks but now since he became a vegan he's huge he's killing his body, his name is Cory Booker he's very unhealthy it's sad that he brainwashed himself into thinking veganism was going to save his life!
He's wearing a zues costume; but i bet he's wearing a short pant under it btw love u bro and ur channel is informative
can you share a photo of your floor just after finishing video?🙄
Just learn to rinse your ass with water ... It's always better then cutting a tree to rub it on your shit smudged anus .. since all those toilet roll replacement papers use water aswell to be created .. so just use water to clean your ass it's much more hygienic as well.
4:09 she said
Love the CRoman Costume Arun!  Love the video,im really looking forward to that self charging power bank.  Love the quality of the videos Arun and i love watching your videos,love and support from Croatia! :D
07:10 sri lankan people... o7😍
👏
The thing is vegan leather is not necessary. The demand for beef and dairy is far higher than the demand for leather, so leather is a byproduct.
Vegan teacher would be so proud
Using plastic on clothes is super bad though. The amount of microplastics released from that to our water systems is horrendous.
Nice costume
The Plastic Road idea is a terrible one for the environment and roads
AWESOME ONE MAN
the background music wa loud today
the soap bottle isnt thought through, if you shower the soap gets wet
in the huel ad he was wearing a team seas t-shirt...
There is Vegan chicken too 😀👍
Loved the new look😂😍
is no one gonna talk about the rickroll behind the poo paper- lol
YOUR BEST VIDEO EVER!
The edible plate idea is definitely derived from the Bakey's edible cutlery company.
Just asking but are you like the most left sided greeny on the plant???
No.13  Don't throw the food  brother...❤️❤️
Huel link not added successfully
Damn
Me watching this video on my phone with a plastic back:  👁️👄👁️
Best suit ever 😂. I can’t take this anymore 😂😂
Wtf is a gallon? And why this stuff? Want mobile tech! 😐
i read that plastic roads may actually be even worse environmentally, as the use and degradation over time breaks it down into micro-plastics that we cannot clean up! So many caveats haha
The thing u are wearing is very lose or for girl 🙃🙃🙃😂😂😂😂
The definition of Heaven On Earth. Passionfruit should come out with a few items like this. I'm sure they would dominate
This Gives me Hope for a Better Future.
The "Facon" is sad in multiple ways. If someone wants to research more, the man made bacons cause harm to almost 3x more cows to produce just a burger's size of  ham.
I'm quite fascinated by how Arun just made the whole video by wearing that angel outfit 😂😂. You pulled it off mann
i just got rickrolled why???
Mrwhosetheboss: *...to restore your faith in humanity* Me: *chokes on water* I'm listening
bravo to the editor for that "that's what" at 4:08
we need a fail video of all the catches you missed💀
When you realize that the two industries that plant the most trees are paper and lumber
Arun being an ethnically correct Jesus is something I didn't know I wanted until now
You are my favourite youtuber. Keep making all these videos. ❤️
Your costume is amazing 👏
Thanks!
Everything is fine but not the dress..🤣
I loved the way this video was made, it gives people an optimistic view towards a sustainable future.
The only problem I see with the fakeon is it’s not bacon 🤣🤣
I got a preroll ad about an automatic toilet lol
5.46 vegan leather Arun:It really gives you hope Also arun : chuck the pineapple down the cloud
the editing is top notch as usual
i like the drip
I mean you are literally wasting energy with all those unwanted lights and big TVs..atleast you should have turned them off for this video🤦🏼‍♂️
Where was "a sub to the channel would be ..........." part?😂😂
Love the way you present everything! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Very informative!
Plastic Roadways... The moment you realize most of this "tech" is incredibly stupid (Again, PLASTIC ROADS) and/or already existed for long before someone with a Kickstarter and a company started selling it... (like those floor tiles that you can step on and make electricty, like some train stations in Tokyo have had those for years) One question: Would you put Theranos on these lists?
No videos i thought you were 🥵
Why can’t I go to the link to buy huel?
Saving the world cost to much most of the inventions on this list are very expensive I bet
Seen 50 % of these over a year ago
Mr.Whosethemoses
Where’s the Huel link ?
I am sure u r wearing shorts 🩳 right?
That last transparent solar panel is really cool. I would contribute a lot to see such a project go through.
Wow! Some serious inventive & thought out shenanigans going on there.. I love the human mind thinking it's way to astounding solutions! Great content as always right here! 👍🏾
No.3 can also be on the wrong side too... it may cause plastic usefuls to get degraded early 🙂
Very Biblical video! Jesus approved ✔
2:07 boys its happening. we're gonna turn our tress into the plastic ones in that dr.seuss movie
If the things in this video get more known and people agree to use them.. WE WOULD BE LIVING AMAZINGLY ON EARTH-
U look cool on those clots😄
Ohh
And the sub to the channel will be ECO FRIENDLY
Epic outfit🔥🔥💯💯
you need to take your pills before choosing your clothes 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
A sub to the channel would be...Heavenly ♥️
8:28 That smiling girl is arun😂
Isn’t vegan leather really poor quality?
Why the super colourful thumbnail tho?
Your videos are so great and funny
💯💯
always waiting for that subscribe pun
Eeeeeeeeeeee
Greta Tunberg commersial
AirInk holy fuck
The Huel link is not working ⚠️
Me eating meat while watching this video: my goals are beyond your understanding
9:20 pfahahah dude... Im European, please stop talking this cringe shi.  Come to Europe, visit some of the poor ones even. for 30-50k you get a 2 person modern new house.  If you had to build a crappy self sustainable whatever lodge, it would be 5/10k.  Please dont spread misinformation about a whole continent 🤣
If these exist then  The question is not ''how'' But why not?
The Box from Xiaomi was praboble the Mi 12
1:06 I’m sure it belongs to that Girl he mentioned 😂😂😂
Love your contents from SriLanka❤️❤️
Is the 16th one called arup is made my arun. Lol
What a dress choice 👍👍👍🎉🎉🎉
having links to products if they do exist would have bin pretty cool but oh well
That pavegen just reminds me of Rick and morty and the battery for ricks car😂
Brown Jesus
Any particular reason to give 09/10 even for the number 1 product in the order? Its a great video as ever boss!
The algea projects deserve atleast a 7.5/10
Gone are the days when you used to seal an envelope with your saliva. Introducing "poopaper". Smells great, tastes even better.
Nike and addidas do the same thing as the first, including the chelsea kit :)
Going back to school😍
Great video. Inventions like these and some which you have mentioned in last videos not only sound great, but bring back faith in humanity!
what would this companys do if theres no more plastic in the ocean?
Some nice ideas but as someone who is more then just disgusted by any kind of mushroom no matter if its a "good" one or a bad one at least that one would creep my out as hell.
The mealworm thing is 5 years old. I’m always hyped about your videos, and when i fact-check them it’s wrong, if not deceiving. Please, be real‼️👎
The first invention is not a good alternative though
"Poo paper" , Ahh those book smellers are up for a wild ride    ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Was I just Rick rolled by a piece of paper made out of poop?!
Uses plastic to make clothes then makes more to make plastic trees 😂😂😂
PAPER STRAWS ARE THE WORST! Anything used to consume liquids should NEVER be made out of paper. I love the idea of that zstraw.
Bluetooth hose
waiting for you to reply at least once, till the very begining😢
Where can I get that bacon 🤔
Cool
great video! but ranking was  super weird imo
22 would be a better fit
9:59 ironically the plates come in a plastic wrapping
8:30 ?
Elephant paper is from Sri Lanka... Elecosy was found later Finally something from my country XD
Cmon guys let's reach 10M fasttttt
Who else want to know about his gf ♥️
Jordar
new video, noice
Nothing beats a fresh new mrwhostheboss video
Where did you but facon, I am a Muslim so I can't est pork, this isn't made out of meat so i can eat it 😋
I'm very impressed by the plastic road.
5:37 ah yes, the lovely Mayon Volcano of the Philippines. Such an honor to be in Arun's video❤️
His Outfit Got Me!
Loved the video Arun!❤️ I hope people adopt being vegetarian/ vegan not just to save environment but also to save animals who are ruthlessly murdered for people's meals.
my day cannot be finished without arun's puns.
5:34 Sadly most people don’t care and enjoy eating them
Elon Musk should use the transperent solar panel on the Tesla,to charge the car
Poo paper???? I’m not falling for that again.
frick you mastercard, i got two 15 sec unskipable ads in the same video.
...that you can just YEET it into the ground [wasted]
Plastic Road is the winner
U made my day  Great work man 👍👍👍
I'm feeling wet just thinking about it 🤣
Poo paper was founded in Sri Lanka but the credit goes to the some other company
I was thinking you haven't posted a new video and when i came back to my phone, there was your video noti
The issue with plastic roads is that while they can't be bio degraded, they most definitely suffer wear and tear and then the microplastics are inhaled and then it just gives way to a BUNCH of health issues because plastic enters our blood stream.   Read up on issues with plastic roads and you'll see what I'm saying here.   I'm not saying that it's wrong to try to find a solution, but this particular one is ultimately more harmful for us than the good it does.
anyone else see the tesco bag
4:31 I think the main reason is that it’s actually ethical
That shower head looked really neat until I saw the prices of them. Sadly hard pass at the triple digits.
Who else was looking at Arun's attire the entire video 😂
sorry but WHAT ARE YOU WEARING
i love you
One problem "Price" .
Arun's female version in barbecue background is amazing 😂😂
I think we Muslims can finally taste bacon without consuming anything haram(forbidden)
I don’t really like bacon it’s chicken for me
Mrbeast should see this video
Nice dress 👌
Now we just need the super ultra mega rich to invest and spread these ideas  Which is easier said than done. Alot of such solutions require forfeiting the "Profit Over People" mindset, which they probably wont.   Its not cheap or even profitable to save the world.
Mr who's the boos   I think I forget to inform us that in a country name Bangladesh scientist have invented a way to make plastic bags with using "Jute" and it desolve in mud   It can also change oure life but no one highlighting this   I hope you do🙂😞
people dont even know their gender   nothing restore my faith to them intill they fix them self
Bro I rarely take any shower 😎😎 , which means I am shaving 1000 glasses of water
6 out of 10 for a wind turbine to charge your phone?  Not really that “revolutionary”.
7:00 Asians figured this out ages ago.😉
cool! chatime is a buisness I wouldn’t think to see in this video!
You dum dums can wash normal plastic straws too 😑
It would actually be heavenly if the software behind all these things was open source and privacy respecting
I don't know that looks like your soap!
Well I got rickrolled
purify the air inside glass ? wow ur genius to believe that 👍
i cant get over how smooth he catched the bottles
6:17 Then i would be taking -1 minute showers?
Sus
6:46: THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID
roman emperor arun isn’t real he can’t hurt you. roman emperor arun :
All these incredible stuff going on yet people working for Biology are getting underpaid so fucking much.  Like you get a Master's, a PhD and all that just to be paid 20/hour??
Dont get too excited about plastic innovation, the bigger issue is microplastic accumulating in our bodies and altering how our body functions even, thats the bigger issue, same with the worms thing, they break it into smaller pieces... which is microplastic pollution, arguably far worse, same with the roads, that water will just drag more microplastic into wherever it goes next... For an enzyme to exist it has to do or be a part of a favorable energetic process for any biological being, thats not the case (yet) and the byproduct is unfortunately, bad/worse.
cool
8:28 He showed his girlfriend photo by editing it on another women😍😍
It took me under 1 minute to shower
❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌ According to a new study, electric cars are more polluting than cars powered by petrol or diesel. Electric car factories also emit more toxic emissions than conventional car factories, according to their report in the journal Industrial Ecology. ❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌
13:35 😳😳😳😳
meal worms,  made by *earth*
is that cash in your hand instead of olive leaves?
Hello Mr boss please pin me
can we appreciate him for adding bacon cooking timer
So I'll finaly be able to taste what the fuss is about? Sign me up
Can we all just take a moment to appreciate the facon-timer?
Like the stand?
holy techy!!!
you just need 1 heavenly invention to save the world, that is the bible.
Did u know that about 00.07 or whatever I forgot the % amount but like a really low percentage of waste I’m the ocean is plastic straws actually about 50% is fish nets that people just threw in there so why should we have to stop
Dude. Get a hold of yourself. You are progressively going of the edge. WTH are you wearing, man?
I love how Arun wear a team sea hoodies at the end.
Definitely the best tech channel ever!!!
"We all love a two in one"............. aaahhhhhh my brain my dirty brain
Op outfit✌️🤭
What’s the point of paper straws you’ve stopped polluting with plastic and went with taking down more trees
The way this video is made is just incredible
Like a Greek god 😂
Nice outfit
Biggest milestone is on the way aron. May god bless you abundantly. Keep it up. Love u more. The best youtuber.
ads are getting annoying
"Put this in my cloud storage " - Godly Arun
the poo paper have long exist but it probably just get commercially available
15:03  There is no free energy (ELECTROBOOM NOISES)
WHERE IS THE HUEL LINK BRO. I'm down for lazy good health lol
Tastest plate I ever had Me : What??
yo hello
Recycle
7:09 rick rolled again
5:48 That's why i use bucket.
Able to ship Huel to Asia countries? Is it safe to consume it daily? Thanks
Wow 1000 glasses that must be like, a bathtub and a bit more  ….
My University actually used some Pavegen on a small bit of campus they built two years ago that had a lot of people walking on it everyday. Although Covid then happened 6 months after which was unfortunate it will eventually make up for the energy used when building and then some
1:16 i can already see it melting in steam of hot shower
The tree planting drone is literally a helicopter parent
So much about saving Earth and in the sponsor section he has a plastic bag and plastic bottle
yea solar and wind power are great and stuff but if we can't store this power it's almost useless, the real innovations to be made are in energy storage like sodium ion batteries per exemple
His outfit reminds me of American pie 6 : Beta house
Can you make a video about impressive  morden inventions from countries
There was a report on how plastic roads are actually bad and increases the number of micro plastic in the environment. It was also found that almost every thing now have micro plastic in them starting from food to even inside the body.
Oof... Dude, you could've made it 22, for obvious reasons. :/  Plastic Roads: Pfff, there are roads that melt in the summer, and they're not even plastic. Now imagine what plastic roads would be like.....
Milo made the video Complete.
great job! 10M subs soon!
seriously my faith on humanity actually came back but if we don't use em we still might be doomed
6:47 that was uncalled for.....
Nice dress
It's not normal people polluting earth, it's the fucking corporations who are polluting and blaming it on us.
Love the content but hate the outfit..
4:27 just eat real food , don't be stupid ...why do you want fake bacon and you want to be a vegetarian?!? that means you want to eat meat ... you mess around a lot with that vegetarian shit.... be natural and eat meat because man  eats everything and it is completely natural ...  5:04 same shit .. real skin is animal skin, it can't be made of fruit and such nonsense ... and that nonsense "save animals" should be solved first by "cleaning" disturbed people because soon there will be no animals to save from ... 5:49 cool, but who cares ... just enjoy your time ... 10:00 they will never sell that patent, although it is good no one needs it because there is no profit .. 10:43 that "garbage" was baked for about 6 minutes and it looks very bad, it certainly tastes like that ... chemicals are used to make something artificial, so think carefully about how "healthy" it is ...
Plastic roads are also harmful as it creates micro plastic. These micro plastic fly in the air and are inhaled by the people which will cause breathing problem and many more problems.
18 tree has something to do with “The lawrax”
According to this video: vegan bacon > removing 30bi plastic bottles from the ocean.
Someone in the future: "Oh shoot I forgot my straw"😭
So no-one is talking about his clothing?
Amazing video as ever tbh probably my favourite voice on YouTube such a nice voice
@mrwhosetheboss when you are colabing with mr beast.........🤔🤔
I love your dress!! Looks like Julius Caesar
this video really did restore my faith in humanity, thanks man.
14:55 Mine too mate.
Um does someone wanna tell the designers of the wind tree that it looks like they glued a lot of green dildos to a metal tree shape
You just made me want to buy everything on the list
bruh that number 7 is wrapped in plastic bruhhh
This costume 🤩
Arun is such a good fielder ! Cricket needs fielders like him!!
This is my appreciation comment before i watch video.Just after thumbnail..... Man that costume!😂 Accept a bow! this is my second fav costumes of unique ones you got!(That's what she said too!😉) First was that shirt that is a proper suit and tie without being one!😂 .... Now back to video!😄❤️
I did a report on the French wind trees in middle school!
Are you not going to review samsung s21 fe?
hey i loved your T-shirt....from where did you buyed it ?........and your content is amazing keep it up!
Jesus Arun Christ
8:19xd. I'm not arguing,but 24 hours is a day. So you can only say 24 hours
**Faith restored succescfully**
Too many ads..
i love your videos. <3
I knew the words Divine, glorious and godly were gonna be used 😎👽
well ....hey there jesus
I'll pass the facon...
Not only Aruns has the best dad jokes, he can also find the most heavenly ways to rickroll us
good video
Thanks for the wesome video!
watching this video made me realize how inneficient our planet is , great video !
10:55 still the tastiest plate I have ever had
I’ll never forgive you for saying “pretty ink-credible”
10:05, hmmm replace plastic. *covered in plastic wrap*
06:48 That's what she said!  How did you miss this Arun😭😭✋
mr whosejesus literally
NUMBER 1 IS GREAT! I saw a video on what would happen if we covered the Sahara in solar panels, and it would change the climate a lot, which isn't good for the natural animals. These transparent panels would be almost like there's nothing there (it would absorb the little UV light that does get to the Earth's surface)
they are amazing!!♥︎♥︎♥︎♡♡♡
Do you know hindi
The plastic dissolving worms are the definition of Game Changer! Wow hope we get to see the results in our life time.
50,000 Euros is not super cheap for a home, the majority of the cost of a house is the plot of land its on, that home still needs that plot of land.
Wow, I am very much amazed at the newly thought out solutions by various people on real world problems. Plastic roads might not be a great one to be promoted, as it can significantly reduce porosity of road surfaces which can increase floods.
I already take like 3 minute showers
Eating less meat is not gonna save the planet. But not using your own car and using public transport can.
Wow what kind of awesome technology that mankind has made. This would save our planet from many years to come.
Wow wow wow! Thank you so much for making this video! Let's make this go viral world wide!
hi
What's the story behind outfit😬😁
Hope the world switch to these stuffs
2:02 I’m allergic to mushrooms do you think I’ll be okay handling this? Lol. I really like the idea haha
Yea...I ain't going go vegan.  I'm try to become more of a carnivore myself.  Enjoying eating nice pig bacon and some eggs while watching this
I doubt any of these products will succeed once investor/tax-money stops flowing in.  And plastic roads...Plastic is not as durable as you make it out to be. talk about a scource for micro plastics, which is a real problem.
The king Of Rick Rolls
Ok  Transparent solar panel with same efficiency and decently affordable price could change the world
I can see restaurants buying ZSTRAW and reusing it
6:47 "That's what she said"
The Power of the Sun in the palm of my hand!
Cool vid lmao
3:59 i actually have these. also what where you gonna say for or should i say?
i never thought I would be waiting for a tech video upload much more than any web series or anime i sought-after.
Eat meat
"let me put this back in my could storage" 🤣🤣
why are you wearing your mother's dress !
I understand the good intentions behind this video. We need hope, we need to know that there are lots of brilliant minds facing all the threats to our species and our planet using technology. But this video is spreading a very harmful idea idea: that technology alone is going to solve all our problems while we relax in our sofas. The problem is not the tech, the problem is the economic system that has to set all those ideas in motion. We don't have the time to wait for all those technologies to be profitable, to be mass produced, to make a real impact on our society and planet. All those problems need more drastic solutions, and the longer we wait, the more we and our planet will suffer the consequences.
I’m convinced Arun has a Stylus subscription or at the very least, he reads their reports.
Really love how cost of western mass produced pollution is another business idea. Not living off less energy never occurs to these people
Will not live in capsules...
3:33 Go back to school Aren /s Algae are not plants
Kudos for actually wearing that cloth and not just in the thumbnails
love the last one!
Arun God of tech
Quite a few of these are pretty dystopian ngl
1:00 Can we just appreciate how smooth he caught those bottles 🤣
This man should be called a champion of puns!
The wind tree looks like spinning dildos. Just saying
So happy you called the vegan bacon facon instead of vegan bacon, because calling something vegan then something which indicates meat goes against itself...
i couldn't stop laughing when i saw your thumbnail man i give you the innovator of the platform 😂😂😂
It’s the tastiest plate I’ve ever had. Arun you sus 💀
Bad video. Not a hater but this information was not so useful. Others were better.
2:00 but when it decomposes it realeses CO2 😭😭
This makes me have hope for humanity again
11:30 imagine if they added those panels to DDR Bordes
Serious you need a shave
The intire video, and not a single free energy device... I am just... gigga baffled and out of words! Great job!
im feeling wet just thinking about it. Mrwhosetheboss 2022
My man’s mrwhosethejesus
I have a reusable rubber straw for like 2 years already
Ive seena vidon e ohome thing it so cool
I used a paper straw once, and I'd rather watch the whole world go up in flames than to ever use one again..
What about @team seas
01:17 WOW! Pretty Smart way! DAMN!
can we plz get a colab with u and tech burner 🔥🔥
6:46  am I the only one who noticed that.
Best tech channel 👏 🙌🏻 👌🏻 👍🏻
Ohh please the dress 😩😩
omg mrwhosetheboss is god
Fakecon?
I have that exact little tree
I'm following you for a long time, you always suprise with your creativity and taking us close to technology. But this video literally mind-blowing and "Wow"... Just awesome, Keeping surprising us. Thank you
This is all great and stuff but all these things are so expensive, no ones gonna buy them so I think you should make this when all these get much cheaper
Awesome vid
I love the number 1 which got a rating of 10/10. Although the main downside of it is its price. Today's solar panels are already not-pocket-friendly, how much more for those transparent ones?
Some of them are kinda scammy
What's the use man, I'm incredibly hyped to use them and help to save and change the world but a very very very small people wants that
6:47 - 6:49 Missed opportunity for a 'that's what she said'
16:50 even he was laughing😭
10:55 U mean the only plate you ate
idk when i take a dump i use water not paper
I think the vegan teacher liked this...
I am waiting for the time when you dress like Mowgli🤣🤣🤣
Hello
Nice ur epic
i drink huel black edition, its delicious af
I bet 1000 bottles of water won't fill up the whole IKEA storage
Quality is improving everytime arun. Hatss off to ur effort
YEET THE MUSHROOM BOX
Eco-modernism wont do nearly enough to save our planet.
Can you make a review video on smart watches and smart bands as well.  Big fan of the channel btw...
my only problem with this video was that the plates made from wheat bran came in plastic wrap... when the whole purpose of the product was to be reusable...but still came in disposable plastic... :/
For real bro idk why Elephant dung is so useful for fricking many thingss
Don’t get me wrong, it’s great people are trying to save the planet. But I will never stop eating actual meat.
I actually don't know if I've ever seen a platic plate before.
Iirc, Thunderf00t debunked the effectivity/practicality of at least two of these (floor power tiles and plastic roads)
I actually don't know if I've ever seen a platic plate before.
I like to think of myself as a longevity/long lasting centric type of guy. For example, when fixing stuff, I like to do things like a "forever fix" solution, rather than a quick patch up job. When buying a new smartphone, my first objective is to protect in ways that it lasts as long as possible like, getting it the best drop/damage proof case, or screen protector, or even having the best care for longer lasting battery in the long run.   And this video gives me more relief than you can ever imagine. that, within all the wasteful things and harmful things that human do to the planet and themselves and the future longetivity, there are still people who are hard at work to reverse the former.
dont be racist i am a building
are Repreve clothes flamable?
Imagine driving in the winter or through a rainy day on a plastic road, you brake in New York and stops in China.
Well Arun initially i too thought of plastic roads are durable, cheap and environment friendly why isn't it installed everywhere.  The problem lies with the use itself. We should know that microplastic are even more dangerous than normal plastic, and the use of plastic in making roads leads to increase in microplastic which are washed away into rivers and other water bodies. They can even contaminate ground water and hence plastic roads should be a territory of 1-2/10.
7:13 notice the paper he's holding? We got rick rolled lmaooo
AYYY TEAM SEAS LESSGOOOOO
I want to buy huel! Where's the link that would support this channel?
The outfit is epic reminds me of my grandma's days of beauty when she was young 🤣🤣🤣
I one thing can you edit the link to the bacon /facon
Never seen cloud storage used in this way😂
😁
2:56 if you are near tropical climate hmm ! When sun is up for few days  its natural phenomenon!
Some of these are just eh to me. I don't even eat bacon since it's Haram and I just honestly wanna stick with real, halal chicken. Those are free range that aren't featherless and stored in boxes.   Also when I heard the barbecue one I was like NOOOOOOOO MY BEAUTIFUL BARBECUES!! but when I heard the sun part I was like yo that's pretty cool
Informative and so interesting!
Eww! Poo paper!!
1,000,000,000x more that mrbeast needs HOW
Having a chuckle at mixing these inventions in weird ways  >A disposable mushroom straw >An algae-powered powerbank >Plates made of soap  >Wind turbines made of wheat bran >A shower that dispenses atomized Facon
Heaven animation coming soon 🔥
Good video, but reducing consumption is the most sustainable step.
makes a video about how to save the environment  *burns a fire cracker in the video
>wheat plates >”there’s no real downside”  me with a gluten allergy: 👀
OMG ARUN THE JESUS
Your dressed like a god
lesssss go
@ 8:28, Nifty way to introduce the girl, Arun :-)
Human: *builds something beneficial for mankind  Others: "A gift of God for the mankind"  The man who thought of and invented it : "Ugh, Screw you"
i'm engineering student, and your video give me many ideas for my research.
Government: reduce ur shower time by 3 minutes. Me: my average shower time is 3 minutes.
Amazing how repreve collected more plastic than the population of the Earth.
That facon slide is smooth >>
Dole lezgooo
Lets see how many subs i can get from this comment! Current: 280
1:59, my respect for him saying yeet
It shocked me when he ate the plate lol
Were you sponsored by the vegan teacher
He picks a wardrobe first and asks “What tech video would fit this costume?” 😁
I like how he is trying to climb a tree wearing slippers with a Roman Empire outfit on top of a phone in hand Production at it's finest 🔥🔥🔥
I see team seas
The bacon actually looks good
This is how you make a change in world inspired brother
7:15 paper from elephant poo 😲😱 .. then remembers how much you used to LICK paper..
I think Mrwhosetheboss should go for a Guiness World record for the most puns per minute 🤣
The pineapple vegan leather is good, but make sure that's definitely what you're buying, as a lot of vegan leather is literally just plastic, and is worse for the planet than actual leather
*Just casually catches a pineapple with one hand like it’s nothing*
The tastiest plate I have ever had
me watching this: acusually yes....but who wants to spend more money. Eatable plates, well you will need to buy new one after one use. transparent solar pannels, cars will become more expensive and only a minority will be able to afford it.
Very cool stuff. Thank you
This video's sponser is huel and there is not even a link in his description to go in huel's website🤣
Sorry Arun, but this one's out of touch, some of them are straight up scams. that vacuum cooker sucks in taste compared to an open barbeque charcoal grill. many others were worse
The main weakness of plastic road is their byproduct when they are being eroded. Unless they solve the microplastic being produced on using that road, it won't be a viable option  Those microplastics are far more dangerous because people can inhale them and accumulate inside our bodies.
2022 trolling came in early. Holy Molly levels of glorious quality videos. Yes Boss! K'em coming... 😍😍😍
Just imagine teamseas partners with repreve
Algee🤣 It is pronounced Al-jee
Sooo...a bath uses more water is actually a lie...
There's so much cool stuff out there... Usually it doesn't go far :(
“they’re basically high tech parents”  the human body is simple now?
One issue I have with plant-based meat is they are usually significantly higher in sodium than real meat. They had to in order to achieve the same taste. They really add up if you are eating those every day. But with the rate we are advancing I am hoping we will have a workaround soon.
if all in this video was applied starting tomorrow i feel like we'd fix all the mistakes in past in less than a year
This guys is my favorite youtubers
Finally a positive video after those top toxics
Breitenhuber- Bright-en-hoo-bair also put a thick german accent on it for good measure
13:34 I'm lactose intolerant lol
Thank you  for supporting our environment 🙏 ❤
Love the costume
These plastic pollution technologies are good, but nowhere near Timeplast. Their plastic goes away in 60 hours! 😱
Cool outfit
I see that the recent videos have RICK ROLLING everywhere in his videos 🤣
wait, is that your girlfriend?
Just use bamboo straws......
Watch Mojo so popular God even doing top 10 list
I like Arun. He rickrolls us :)
Sorry Arun, this one's out of touch, some of them are straight up scams. that vacuum cooker sucks in taste compared to an open barbeque charcoal grill. many others were worse
Anyone noticed something at 8:32?
those plastic eater worms,what will poop?
The third thing the mealwprms are pretty bad they can eat at very small amounts and the debri they leave behind will be just as same maybe a little better but nah i cant see that being a real thing
The quality of your video are honestly top top top tier, from how the backgrounds change, the sidebar which makes the video incredibly organized, of course the tech itself, how you put your placements right at the end, honestly, I'd say the highest quality videos if YouTube
Love ur vids btw keep up gud work
What is this outfit 🤣🤣🤣
So noone talks about divine and godly pretty much meaning the same thing :D
the soap bottle seems usefull. but soap lasts quite long. so does that mean you get stuck with a lot of soap bottles?
Didn't u use angelic recently??

Hi thanks for the great video. Where I can find huel link to buy. I am in canada.
€50,000 is cheap??👀
Edible plates invented to reduce plastic..... but comes with plastic wrapping, I see no use
Paper straws are literally the worst thing on the planet. I don't want to drink soda with pulp.
please do more invention videos, these are pretty interesting
The elephant poop = paper thing is decade's old it's being used by people for a long time 🧐
His Videos are the only ones i like even before i start watching them cause i know he ain't gonna disappoint 😌
The problem with all the super recycled product eg like clothing  it’s more expensive then product that are not made from recycled material

Devine mean godly or godlike does it not?
I always had the drone idea when I was a kid but people where like are u dumb . Now they are dumb 🙄
Kinda sus that you're drinking under the table sir😂
only old fam knows what happened here 07:08
How can drone plant a seed. How is it going to dig soil🤔
13:35 me being lactose intolerant 😭
0:44 Very good way of clearing out that you've rated it as per the coolness of them because that was about hurt a lot of people! 👍
I love your vids! Although if I may input my thoughts on about "going vegan", the thing is as a species we are biologically omnivores so it wouldn't make sense to go all out vegan but that Fakon do look good and it's a good alternative to meat from time to time... No hate towards Vegans you do you and I respect you guys.
this was released at 6am for me still watch right after it released
Arun talking about environment while wearing a plastic golden leaf headband thing 😂
12:20 Gekoloniseerd 🇳🇱
Fun fact : Arun forgot to put the sponsor link in the description
not buying huel because it comes in a plastic bag lmao
this is nice vid
"They are basically parents but more efficient" Mrwhosetheboss 2022
Hello about the straw here in Argentina se have a reusable straw we call bombilla . Is for an specific use , a tea called mate . Is Made of metal and need to be cleaned every time . Is weird to use for something else
I guess Solar shouldn’t be placed at the number one spot, Solar is such a thing that requires a lot of raw material and environmental damage while setting it up, next comes it’s maintenance…A number one spot should be given to the one which creates almost zero environmental damage for its manufacture and is also environment friendly during its working…
0:25 the first product is pretty good, but sadly, although this will recycle plastic, it creates another problem: microplastic. Solved a problem but then created another problem :(
I love how you yeeted the box XD! I love the stuff you find! Your amazing!
Best video yet!
4:09 thats what
he revealed he is actually God...
Apologies but who takes 25 minute showers? It's like 5 minutes for me.
That outfit tho, HAIL LORD CAESAR
veganism is cancer
This is an amazing video. I’m saving it to see if I can use some of the products myself.
Most of them not really safe the world. Marketing always lying..   We are destroying our beautiful world with high consumption of everything.  Caused of overpopulation..
Best Tech Channel in YouTube 🔥
12:19 but, what if the plastic melts due to the sun...
That Airpen definitely is inkredible
What you ate in the lunch , mrboss: just fakecon and same plates ... :)
What are you wearing,bro?
i nees a new phone cant afford it
5:57 what is a gallon?
What an outfit. Reminded me of Aladin. And as usual awesome content. 🔥🔥
No huel link?
The amount of puns
16:05 You mean all of that lovely UV light that heats up my house during sunshine hours in the winter time? That UV sunlight that saves me on central heating bill? So I would trade a little bit of incredibly inefficiently converted UV energy electricity for a bunch more hot water from the central plant that can convert anything/everything at a 97+% effenciency (encluding spare windmill electricity via heat pumps)? Sorry mate. All of these decentralized proposals are just not feasible for the vast majority of people/implementations.
Does anyone remember the scene in The Expanse where Amos beats up few baddies in the bathing area for trying to scam passengers in the name of insurance. Didn't the shower heads look and function similar to Nebia Moen.
Wow Arun in costume, Nice 👌
Huel link is broken Arun
I feel like I wait for a movie in the making, but when it releases it's worth the 20 mins
Nice
It's so reassuring that companies are working on sustainable technological solutions for betterment of humanity and planet.. and thank you very much for bringing all that tech in form of such an incredibly informative and interesting video Kudos for that ✌️✌️
4:40 need I say more
Repreve should have joined mr beast so they could have collected all the bottles they got
Until your soap bottle get washed away
Arun this is my favourite video yet, I will definitely be switching to most of these products
6:48 Aron : i feel wet thinking about it   Me: hw should I take this in
Love the video but interesting fact trash incinerators actually are very clean and are a great way to get rid of plastic
Is no one gonna talk about Arun's OOTD?
Now i need every items he mentioned..
We shouldn.t just convert plastic waste into clothes or anything. We should stop using plastic in unnecessary stuff at all! No more plastic bottles, single use dishes, no more plastic wraps etc. Converting waste it.s not a solution imho
Watching this guy’s videos makes me feel poor
New idea, totally love it
3:50 totally not an idea of EU🤷‍♂️
The outfit tho 😂😂
Anybody who watches this, may god bless u
I liked the video at the beginning without even watching it
The REPREVE company currently recycles about 8,333,333 bottles every hour. That's literally 8 bottles from 200 million at 199,999,992 bottles every day. So currently, at the rate they are going at right now, they will get past 100 billion bottles before the end of 2022. Which means at the end of 2022 they will be at 104,043,218,868 bottles recycled into various clothing, and camping gear.
How this is done by only 3 people still amazes me
do people really think they are saving the cows with vegan leather?
Rick Roll everywhere
Get this man to 10 mil subs!!!
1:40 wait that did xaomi gift you??
I’ve actually learned about Agave straws. Straws made out of a plant and they are surprisingly firm and don’t dizzolve
How did the cotton clean up go? Haha
I lik dis video
4:09 😂
INKredible
These videos make me feel world will be a better place in future and its worth living and enjoying life let's change the world and make it a better place 🌎
Every thing is Good untill he changes clothes
Hey Arun, why you didn't act in Game of thrones 🤗
pavegen and plasticroad should team up and create plastic tiles that you can step on to create electricity
Cringe
The mushroom box is kinda underrated
The 50k euro house is actually horrifying considering how anti consumer companies have become. Imagine that you pay full price for the tiny house but you have to pay monthly premium for all the power and water which could be way higher then normal electric, water, gas bills and since different functions can be controlled by an app it means the company that sold you could cut off services anytime they want. Of course even in normal house if you don't pay your bills your services will be cut off but with a "smart" house like the one in the video companies could force you unwanted services and even disable certain function if you sold your house (something like what Tesla does). Not to mention that unless you own land you will probably need to rent land too. At this point 50k euros for a tiny two person home is super expensive. You might as well get a bus house that is mobile.
I like the outfit
You took wrong sponsor for this video because Huel meal is packed in plastic :(
😂 Jesus arun looking good
When is the MI 12 series video coming
In every vid we all get rickrolled ngl
That Godly outfit makes me request your hoodies 🔥🔥
Sadly number 4 isn't godly at all... With the sun shining with UV-light on the plastic street and water flowing over it when it rains microplastic is produced. This is then washed in the sewage system and ends later in our drinking water because there is no real efficient way to filter them out. So it's not a very bright idea to pollute ourselves when trying to make things better..
6:47 "Im feeling wet just thinking about it"  Well thats not gonna be taken out of context at ALL😀
When he said floppy, there was a “ that’s what “ in the background 😂😂. I presume that’s what she said ?
Was that "EAT" intentional at 10:33 ?
I was honestly expecting him to say "a sub to the channel would be.... poo."
instead of shower why dont people use a bucket and a mug?
Arun be looking bussin in the new outfit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I bought a winter coat made 100% from recycled plastic from Michael Kors. It's insulated as expected and keeps me warm. Such a good idea!
That foldable straw doesn't deserve to be on the list, metal straws are better and simple alternative
nice
when youtube gives u 4 double unskippable ads
Hello
because of medical reasons, I can't go vegan
Love your dress, but most of these inventions are not that useful. The big problem is energy storage for renewables. Nuclear energy could be a solution today, but for some reason it is not popular among influencers.
i love your vids
To save the world, we’d need to stop the cancel culture and be free to tell truth, and call idiots idiots.
6:10 I feel exposed for being in the bathroom  Also I remember the Ecosphere from the 2016?18? Edition of the national Geographic Kids magazine!
vegan food = better for the planet?? have a look at "beyond meat" the amount of logistics involved in moving the various ingredients around the world produces far more CO2 than a cow... its all lies!!! great video tho!  EDIT: i put the plug in when im in the shower and there is nowhere near 1000 glasses of water in the bottom of the bath after 20 minutes!! the bath isnt even half full after 20 minutes so again.. lies lol
6:47 that's what she said
I think you should have done more research on vegan leather. It's way more poluting to environment to make it, than just use waste product of meat production. Besides, it's quality is inferior to genuine leather. Most of you probably seen chipping leather on a jacket made of it.
The solar glass could potentially make it electric cars don't need charging or massive increase their range at the very least.
Keep on going with those dude, you could trigger something great. Being eco friendly shouldn’t mean we have to lower our standards or suffer but people need to know about these products. There’s a low impact version of nearly everything out there. Great work.
Yeah most of this is good but vegan stuff is pure dog water
This is so cute.
HOLDDDDDD UPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!! 17:23 Arun, did you mistaken 19 for 21???
Why do your videos not have time stamps anymore?
Ah yes poo paper, it will also solve another problem which is people eating paper.
As good as many of these ideas sound, there is a reason why they are not yet wide spread. The platicround for example. Plastic is very badly influence by heat, direct sunlight/UV light and also water. So they will degrad faster right now.
My only problem with this video is that divine should be above glorious
The American’s give NASA 50 million a day and NASA has done Nothing for humanity
Any of these gimmicks that are related to reusing plastic would require tedious and careful separation of plastic waste (it's not happening currently, even if you don't forget putting out your recycling bins on garbage-day). So you would need to engineer your product based on a mismatched hodgepodge of materials that act completely differently (and often the opposite way), but mostly is made of PE, HDPE, PU and PVC. That's about as specific as making something out of "wood".
I think this video is so cool and I think it’s great that you are supporting team sea
love your vid man, have a good one.
This was my favorite video on your channel. I really enjoy this series altogether! Hope you do a lot more
Arun, you're doing a great job. But I think you should not rate them out of 10 like that...maybe you can give them stars for their efficiency.
i am early and like this
6:49 needs a “that’s what she said”
13:22 No it's not when you use that energy to power and heat your homes, like they do in Denmark... It also saves you the trouble of having to allocate land for landfills all the time and try to come up with solutions or excuses when they start washing in to the sea after 40+ years...
The advancements humans make lead me to believe that the future is gonna be pretty easy to sustain, but the humans themselves make me question if we'll even survive the 2020's
a mass produced use of transparent solar panels can be found in the Garmin Instinct Solar smart watch. really really good at keeping it self going. when i keep it in a lower power mode, it can keep it self charged indefinitely with just four hours of sun a day. great for hiking.
Leather is a byproduct from the beef industry. So by using vegan leather, you're creating the need for an entirely new line of industry, from collection at the farm, processing, to shipping to consumers. This is terribly damaging to the environment, using the metrics it seems you're using.
Sooo, anybody else think those were b🍑ttplugs in the thumbnail or was it just me?
Elecosy (nr 11) has a store near me and we’ve used a lot of their paper. Mostly their enveloppes.
Poo paper is made in sri lanka 🇱🇰
Who the f takes 25 min showers omfg ! I thought the point of shower was that its quicker than a bath
Guess what I am going to submit as my homework..
Very informative and fun video as usual. You are at 9.62 million subscribers as of right now, you are gonna reach 10 million soon 🥳🥳(waiting for that moment). Also a very very nice outfit 🤣🤣
Mm
12:28 the problem is actually that companies don't want roads to last so long. The money they get from goverments for fixing the roads is what funds their corrupted pockets. So they wouldn't contact contractors who sell plastic roads. That's why we haven't seen these plastic roads take over even after it being so great.
This man deserves 100million subs ngl
I have never seen any body doing so on YouTube.
Veganism is the one line I won't cross. I'm sorry, but I need and want my meat.
It feel so weird how companies are trying to be environment friendly and were now the one whos destroying it to get into the get rich quick propaganda
I domt know why the @mrwhosetheboss will like cmnt
He Rick roll us every video lol
You know it's gonna be good when we are at 17 and it's already a 5/10
thank god your back  i was worried🤓
16:49  i think we all know why you're using both hands for shaking it 🤣🤣
Content creates changes 🤣
Hey Arun... What are you wearing downside 😁
your videos are such gold content, keep going like this bro
I love how Arun opens dictionary to find a word to describe subscribing 😂🙌
12:40 the only issue i see here is the plastic kinds being eroded away, so it turns into microplastic and gets washed into the groundwater by cars driving on it and gradually breaking it doen
1000 glasses is a 10x10x10 cube.
1:40 umm. Whats in the box?!
This is one of my favourite videos. So much great information on how the world is changing. I'm definitely going to look into that shower more.
I love how a building that can power itself, and make fertilizer isn't better than a single power bank that can charge itself.
LOL JUST IMAGINE EATING THAT POO PAPER BY ACCIDENT
5:50 that's why I don't take a shower.
This video is so smart, by the time that an average viewer is about to leave he started the timer for the bacon, which people would definitely want to stay for because people love bacon and by the time that's done it's about to be in the top 5 which people would want to see. Very smart 👌
So many controversial facts in one video….
The power of the sun....  ....in the palm of my hand
All of these slowly increased my faith in humanity.
arun you are soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cooooooooooooooooooooooool🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊
a
Arun has a good catching ability 😂
biotrem plates made to reduce plastic. packaged in plastic, oh the irony
Love how your channel is getting a lot more environment conscions and spreading awareness on products that are good for the earth❤ keep up the good work mate!
Every 3rd grader reacting to poo paper: Eww. I’m not writing on poop.
Too much adds, frustrating😤
In France they started using pastas as straws :)
He made this video just to get excuse to dress like a roman god.
What if , the company that makes the plastic dress and the company that makes ink out of air pollutants Collab? Wouldn't that upgrade it by levels?
Nice outfit 😀
14:40 Mr. beast's Trees are costlier !
You're really the boss Arun
Wow
Here I am at 10 AM watching a guy eat vegan bacon on plate of wheat...
9:47 Who knew that trailer trash would end up saving the planet after all... All jokes aside though, this could be scaled up with a Battery pack and be truly off grid... reliably... Make it twice or thrice the size and you could have toilet/shower and possibly a tiny kitchen for the rare occasions you don't eat on the go. This would be perfect for the modern selfish /childless career driven egotists, who need to stay mobile for those opportunities... How about we stick to the plan, man. Implement the actually affordable gridscale options that are getting cheaper and cheaper and leave this utopian dream toy stuff to the dreamers!??!
Love your channel, Marcus Arunelius
I'm just commenting just so that the "algorithm gods" get this to more people! Amazing video!
5:52 please use the metric system or include it 😔
Worlds best rickroler
3:07 The company is named after me
This gave me faith in humanity
Omg the Kardashians gonna turn into a plastic road 😱😱😱
This feels like we got patch notes for the new update
Toga! Toga! To... oh, wait are we not doing that?
need to do more research about the carbon emitions of cows compared with plants
Oh noes ecologism :(
Okay solar windows, where to start. You know how solar panel have segments and conductors going through and around these segments? That's to get the electricity from the cells themselves. It's nice having transparent cells, but unless you can invent transparent wires, your windows will be covered by a metallic grid. Useful for some applications, not for regular windows tho.
Methane biproduct for the poo paper is terrible
Noticed that alot of these eco-friendly products have plastic packaging
Who else love the outfit
Wait they recycled plastic to make clothes made of plastic. I mean good but whyyy
Anytime I see a mrwhosetheboss video is click the video so fast flash gat nothing on me
Love the outfit Arun  Mr Zeus the Boss perhaps.
The most informative video regarding helping earth in an easily understandable way in YouTube ever. 😘
Very cool inventions, but the problem with some of them is that they can be very expensive and majority will not be able to afford.
Love the outfit 😁😅😁
8:28 thought we wouldn't notice? But we did😂
the future scares me, not the inventions itself, but the possible catastrophic failure of it
Hopefuly the companies can get their hands on some grants and expand quickly! Perhaps even to the EU! We should appeal to the politiciancs!
Im getting concerned that your a dad, for the stupidly amount of dad jokes
50 cents a tree at full efficiency means 10,000 USD a day
The Biohybrid Chandelier is genuis and so cool
Ok these are great, But the poo paper aint doing it man. Thats gonna flop real quick, Aint no one wanna write on poo paper
17:00 Basically he is hinting his collab with Mr Beast.
I'm shocked ! how he can pull off perfect word everytime.
That jesus look suits you.....Btw....great video.
this video is incredible
.
The huel link doesnt work
Imagine you are just having a normal day and you see this man filming his videos in his yard what would you do?
I love u aron
i love this video can you send this   to our president
Thought your YouTube account was hacked 😌
9:24 for 50k euro you can buy a 30 square meters flat in most of eastern europe
Whats with this outfit though 😂😂
Mrwhosetheboss going Greek-y
🤣🤣🤣🤣dress, here comes the saviour,
Thanks mrwhotheboss never disappointed when I come to ur channel
☀️              🚀                🕳️           🚀
Uuugh, why does something as cool as the Wind Tree System, look like a bunch of spinning anal plugs in a skeletal tree?
Tech burner ki jai hooo
Hey man,  Mad respect to you dude. I'm a vegetarian, and thus have always heard about bacon, but never really got to experience how good it tasted. Facon may just be that solution.  Thanks a ton for making this video, as I think a lot of us really need this hope radiating our way.  Also, people should appreciate this guy's music choices. :))
Wow. I had no Idea such amazing technology was out there. I’m really looking forward to the future!
I like the outfit
bruh its Prounced algee not algey
When he pulled Rick asly I thought he rickrolled us with the poo paper
This is the best tech channel on this planet.
The costume tho
Wow 😳 future is here ❤️
When I was younger I thought all paper was made from poo and now it is reality
Bro Ur the best frfr
The clothes ahahahahahahaha just perfect
The god of tech has spoken!!
210k VIEWS IN 1 HOUR that's ho w you know he's good.
His Graphics Designer is next level that Outfit looks Real
Waiting for thunderf00t's debunking ;D
a sub to the channel would be heavenly wouldve been angelic
brilliant - absolutely hilarious way of getting the msg across - thank you got making the content so watchable and funny
Its not mistake ✨its masterpiece ✨
These videos are incredible
Been a while Arun! But I am so happy you took your time and came out with this masterpiece of a video👌🏽
Today I had a dream where I was on a video call with Arun and he was angry at me just because I was constantly video calling him while he was shooting a video😂😂
Love that Jesus suit very pretty hope to see it abit more in videos
I can't get over the fact that Arun literally worn a robe for this video.😂
I like your clothes
But does anyone here know what happens when solar panels get destroyed?
Honestly I think the plastic roads is a great idea. Why because of all the reasons he said and we can make them panels so we don’t have to dig up concrete to get to a pipe and refill it to in 2 weeks when we could get it done in an day and it be MUCH more cheaper
Uhm.. where is the link for the Huel thing? I would Actually want to buy some can't find it in the description 😩
Me when barbecues have lids
Get an intro  Will increase vid quality
Btw, love the outfit !
the energo and plastic roads are pretty good.kinda curious how damageable they are.anyway,its cool that we have ways to produce more electricity but too much of it is starting to be bad for health.
Facon is essentially the halal version of bacon
Does  huel delivers their product world wide
Advance congratulations to hit 10Million subscribers 🥰🥰
7:10 . . . . . . . . . You just got Rickrolled. Classic move Arun ❤️
Hey Arun I think you forgot to change your onlyfans costume 😂
I feel like this list is inverted. 1:35 deserves to be higher.
Most of the pollution could be taken care of in the UK if they re planted forests back on the pennines.
If I get a dollar for everyone he says bio/plastic I would be a millionaire
best yt ever. love ur vids
insane like ur vid but i have a question like can any 1 in the comment help fix my computer issue i some how uninstalled intel graphics card driver how can i get it back plz any
Hi there

Good video

Not sure we'll ever stop air travel I guess electric planes or alternative fuelled aircraft will be the sensible next step. I'm not going to stop seeing my family or friends by not traveling. Teleportation would be amazing though!😅  I've worked with pavegen on a project 6 years ago. Fantastic company.
Good video
Good video
Really appreciate your efforts on making a video on this topic.. 👌👍🙏
This is why science is amazing, taking things we've developed and making new products and/or turning them into energy to help make more for ourselves and the world. ♡
That thumbnail 😂 ✨ *OUTFIT* ✨
Shows plate that can replace plastic Plate comes wrapped in plastic
the vegan teacher be like: I FRIKKING LOVE THIS
🌹❤️🌱🌲🌳🌴
Arun Caesar. Has a ring to it.
Everything about this video was Inkredible 🖋👏
We need bioluminescent trees to replace street lights
The background music in the first part of the video made me think that somebody was turning my PlayStation on every 2 and a half seconds
"tastiest plate I ever Had"... You have been having a lot of plates, without even getting married 😄
I'm patiently waiting for the reviews of Xiaomi 12 pro and OnePlus 10 pro. I hope you review them soon because you give the best reviews period.
Soapbottle is not going to be developed. They finished the kickstarter campaign and reimburse the pledgers
2927th :D
Early
His puns are evolving
man this man wearing plastic leaves in this video
Teleshopping?
That's what 🤣
My man finally remembered he's a YouTuber
missed opportunity: helicopter parents
CUTE "INVENTIONS" .... 🥺....PLEASE
You're a better depiction of what jesus actually looked liked than the current percieved look.  I kneel
Y no one is talking about his coustume It's dope 🔥
Poo paper shouldve been #1 change my mind
I love trees but i have no space in my house 😥
This is all from sus town
lots of these are merely concepts that would require decades to produce any meaningful difference.
👍😍😍
Sir you are best tech youtubrt
If there something like the 1st one we might not get signal behind it
What happens to those kids who chew paper? 😩😩
On 10:10 it's like we will not use plastic plates but we will us plastic for packing 🥴🥴
I feel like a wide adoption of bidets would be even more environmentally friendly than just Poo Paper. It's proven to be cleaner too by research. You can then use a reduced amount of tissue or Poo Paper to dry up. Heck, there are even bidet dryers these days.
I love the fact that there are inventions to stop these problems but the implementation of the inventions is very very less I mean lets take the dustbin which traps  plastic in the sea its brilliant but the implementation is so very less , in my opinion these companies should be collaborating with governments of countries to get them to use.
Mrwhostheboss videos make my days tnxs arun
16:20  excuse me what did i just hear?!?!!
Vegan teacher taking notes
who wants the old outro back?
Opened Insta say ur story  Came to YouTube  And now my day is cmplt 😍
Actually..your videos are heavenly 😇😇
I thought there would have been more CES stuff
6:20 cut shower time by 3 minutes I NORMALLY HAVE A 3 MINUTE SHOWER AND THATS IT am i supposed to have a 1 second shower or something
If you keep the soapbottle under your shower and use it with your wet hands, isn't it gonna dissolve while using?
I'm not sure about solar panels. These need to be replaced at some point. Current panels will be the next watse problem. I think that the ability to discard them in an environmental friendly manner should be the main focus before we stick them in every building.
Now everytime i wait for your next vedio. Please do review of redmi 12 pro max🙏
the fact that these exists proves that saving the planet is possible. we just need everyone to work together.
22: Me.
Now everytime i wait for your next vedio. Please do review of redmi 12 pro max🙏
Someone needs to be the number one tech channel...wait too late😂  Big up Mr boss 💪🏼
Poo paper? Oh boy, as someone who as a kid had a habit of just eating paper , this sounds like a potential nightmare situation. Good thing we are in a digital age and I rarely use paper to write on.
Wow 🤩
I just hope that these concepts which are actually god tier can become real common things and get implemented on large scale.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW I MUCH I LOVE YOUR CONTENT... (PLEASE POST EVERYDAY :) )
Wish he were wearing a KRISHNA dress...
I don’t know why,but for a period of time I hit the like before watching the full video,got used to quality content all the time :))

The biggest problem with wind and solar power isn't being able to produce enough electricity, it's not being able to store it.  It also makes it much more difficult to balance the power grid.  There are all kinds of technologies being developed to try and store very large amounts of energy from pumped hydro, to spinning fly wheels to yes batteries.  But I can certainly see that office buildings could benefit from solar windows as they use most of their electricity during the day.  Maybe they could have some massive battery installation in the building to store electricity from those sunny weekends.
Thanks to mi, now Milo can give Arun better massages! BTW, great vid, loved the heavenly theme!!
6:20 when I was younger I accidentally took like an 1 1/2 shower now that I hear that I look back with more disappointment then before.
Arun Your Shirt 🔥🔥
Petition for Arun to post that Jesus outfit on his Instagram 😂
The poo paper is actually quite a old invention . I have some seven year old poo paper from Shri Lanka .
hi fav youtuber
Wow . Loved your outfit 😜
To think that he spends 40 hours just to script these amazing top notch videos is mind blowing
I like the pineapple leaf vegan leather. Cuz the other kind of vegan leather is called plastic, and that obviously has it's own issues b
❤️❤️❤️
That's not a powerbank that charges itself, that is a micro wind turbine hooked up to a battery. Sounds a lot less exciting when you just say what it is.
10:34 Ahh nice way to get a comment.    . . Oh wait. Gaaddamit Arun Hire me!
the hotel link doesn't worl
That plate takes "eat it all, kids" to another level
He’s so slick with the Rick rolling😂 I love it
Your videos are the best
You forgot the like button.
Man...the moment u stop including humour, i am gonna hit unsubscribe. Thats how deep i am njoying ur humour, i dont care about the tech anymore.
That's all nice and feel good, but radical legislations and global political changes can actually make a difference in our planet
Arun please tell me you are vegetarian or non veg
Why tf you dress like jesus
Loving it, but the plastic roads are a terrible idea, as when they wear out, that's just swapping asphalt micro-particles for microplastics, unless I'm missing something...
Do racism
tbh I stopped watching the digital phone content here because it just seems bias. Plus it's not as informative as some other channels now that I watch.  If you had two channels and this type of content was on it I'd be happy to eat fakon and clean up the environment. I definitely like this content more. Feels a ton more useful (in a way).  Sorry about this comment, but I'm just no longer wasting time watching videos on just a look at a phone. I need a lot more than that. Like 5G real world tests in certain areas. Or camera comparisons for not just one or two but a set of them then (against themselvess/each other) and a final YOY review of all within the year and YOY. Which could be done for any specific topics on phone related content, since I know phones are your thing. It's not that I hate phones it's just I'm done with just "looking" at phones or just "viewing" the unboxing.   I hope you start doing specialized channels, it would be nice. However I'm not against the new viewing format. Good editing and new themes. I hope you understand that this is not trying to bash but just wanted to give your channel a "review" of my own. I'm probably don't speak as eloquently as you can but I hope you can read my message without feeling I'm trying to attack you, because I don't want to start a bitching thread. Cheers!
What a dress

nice
10:34 What happened to the word "eat"
Hallo
So I got rickrolled without even seeing a video? Wow!
Has anyone noticed that the Nanoleaf Aurora light panels are gone?🤔
Well, let me just say one thing about Wind Tree System and Pavegen, they are not gonna work. Many of the inventions we see that seem good at first, don't work or don't scale well. Like, take Wind Tree System for instance, for a single tree, it might be OK, but increase the number of trees, and you have a system that is expensive to make and maintain, and the electricity produced doesn't scale with the number of trees. Pavegen, on the other hand, is probably too expensive to make, and produces little to no electricity.
When I saw reprieve get a 2/10 I knew the last would be insane
HI
First timers: JESUS CHRIST!!!
any chance we see the xiaomi 12 in the next video ?
Number nine is boring, it takes away the campfire feeling
Gezoz
Wtf what the hell you weared🤣😂🤣😆😁🤣
Thank you for such an informative video
damn that catch tho
Man those that's what she said jokes hit hard
Now, the main problems about these products are...They're pretty dang expensive. I mean like not extra expensive but just enough for them to be not affordable for an average person
Would be nice if Apple made their new glasses out of recycled plastic. Imagine if all plastic on phones (and chargers, cables, protective cases etc) were done that way... May give Samsung, Apple, Google and co. an incentive. Would be a lot more effective than not giving us charging blocks, the cheap bastards
Did anyone notice a bacon on the bottom right corner 🤣🤣🤣
7:10 they should name it pooper
3:51 @Micheal Reeves do you have anything to say??
6:50 No amount of production quality, ingenuity, and class can make me forgive you for Rickrolling me for the nth time, and with poop, nonetheless. You're ebil!!!1! D:<
Incredible inventions. The transparent solar panels is insane. I’m surprised Elon musk hadn’t invented this for Tesla cars. Car’s that can self re-charge through the windows is an incredible advance in technology.
What I was waiting for
When you buy a juice box you get a paper straw and some times you can't put the straw into the juice box it just get smashed when you try to put it in the box🥺
So what's the target for your unique adjectives record?
I hope you reach 10 mil soon because your videos are so good!!
I looooove your videos ❤️
First love ur videos
this made me feel.good
no
mrwhosethegod
Mr. beast wants to know your location 😂 btw still waiting for your collab after that tweet
I love these vids 😍
I really hope they don't make some plastic eating organism.. I feel like it could plague all our lives and do alot more damage than good. Like eating our cars, bottles, computers x.x
Covid controls and 'Climate Catastrophe' aren't about human health or the environment. It's increasingly obvious that politicians are exploiting 'Psyence' for multi-trillion paychecks for banks, treasuries and corporations. They are resorting to repressive measures to bully their free-thinking populations who are bubbling their global fraud. If they had any genuine Science, they would be happy to bring the evidence and open up to public debate, but they're hiding from credible Scientists, substituting baseless mantras and using their accomplices in the MSM and Big Tech to cover for them.  Resistance is growing everywhere. People can smell something seriously wrong.  "Two weeks to flatten the curve" becomes nearly 2 years of Lockdowns. Kerr-ching!! Trillions in Pandemic money-printing. "Take this Jab and you'll be fully-vaccinated". Kerr-ching!! for Big Pharma. "Variants!!" Kerr-ching!! "Boosters every 6 months!" More kerr-ching! Meanwhile, Energy and Food Prices inflated, all that Kerr-ching going into inflating Stocks and Property for the asset-rich. More kerr-ching for 'Infrastructure' that isn't made of steel or concrete, or anything material. More Kerr-ching for 'Green New Deals'. The Planet is melting, the Planet is drowning, 'Weather Panics!!", 'there'll never be another snowy Winter, and you'll never see another Polar Bear' if we don't Kerr-ching some more trillions.  Are you seeing a Script unfold among western governments who are all curiously synchronised to the same money-printing, power-grabbing policies and messages?

This man is from future.
Transparent solar panels could actually make us progress faster than someone going to the bathroom after Taco Bell
So, You've ate a plate before?
Everything on this list had my jaw dropped
1. Invention: 9/10  16:17
The best inventions are the ones that monetize waste reduction. In back to the future that was mr fusion, making fuel from trash, but i think building houses from plastic based concrete is an amazing idea. Instead of filling a landfill with permanent waste you are helping to create a permanent city with the same lifespan, and maybe helping to solve the housing crisis. That permanence is not a bad thing, as long as it is not wasteful.

This dress looks like came from heaven😇😇😁
Heavenly ❤️👍😃
Why did you light that but I do have it on new year
The wind trees are an intriguing idea, but they won't do much towards addressing the inequality of accessible shade in communities and cities. As for plastic roads, what is stopping the microplastics produced as they degrade from washing out into ecosystems and ultimately ending up inside us?
Thanks for the video! Huel is awesome btw
1. Transparent solar is bad if its put up the birds die birds die cuz of glass
6:47 thats what she said
5 Moto G71 ads, 3 of them lasted for 20 seconds. Destroyed the whole watching experience.
The moment when you realise that you wasting sooooo mich water while Waschung the vid.
What's with the outfit Arun , looking like a gem 🤗🦋
Plasticroad sounds awesome. I'd love to see that come to life.
Number 12, the shower head, has existed for ages. I got a combo one myself, that can switch between normal, a mix of normal and “steam” and full “steam”. My kids are scared of the steam but I like it. Note that it is definitely not like a body mist that gently sprays your face or body, the pressure is indeed much higher than normally, so high that having it directly spray your face is quite uncomfortable.

So much effort for a single video 🤩 Really awesome Arun 🔥
do you intend to keep the clothes for other videos ? 😀
The costume really crackled me up! Great video as always Arun!

Plastic road is a scam,
What are you wearing man!
LOVE THE OUTFIT no cap
Every time I  see him asking for subs i am gonna have a dictionary 😂
Let's not ignore the fact of what they sent to him at 01:38
I want to start a tech channel like yours
A lot of these sound good on paper but in practicality probably wouldn't work as good as they advertise. Seems gimmicky to me.
Who's been here since  2 million followers? I love and admire your channel Thank you for spreading the message of awareness❤❤❤
8:30 who is that beauty sitting inbetween 😁😁
Cool
This one was a really really positive video and it made my day
Bro I was literally telling my self yesterday that I haven't seen a video from @Mrwhosetheboss and I watched back old vidoes and now I'm so happy to see this😁
Looks like we getting somewhere in an effort to be more efficient and earth friendly.
after num 11 i'm a bit hesitant on touching paper now since it could be elephant sh!t
More of this cool planet saving stuff please
We love you That doesn't mean you can post anything What is this There's no camera test No battery test No performance test You are not following current smartphone trend Yes your content is excellent Your content is out of this world But dude our priority is smartphone Do something like 3 videos about smartphone And one about this kind of topic
Thanks!
Sooo, no one gonna talk about that fire Tshirt?
Yo that’s kinda religiously wrong
suddenly decides to show the poo part when I started eating a chocolate bar
I Think he just bored with phone that's why he made this content
"Soyent green is people"
This is all fascinating as hell! My favorite item was the algae chandelier!
I am so early that i can't find any good comments about his GODLY costume
Some great comsumer products, but not one of them is a good value for money. Hopefully more competitors will aim to manufacture products like these in the future, so that it can become more affordable for the mass market.
Jesus Christ this was such an informative video!
Transparent solar 💯💯
Zstraws are even more ridiculous than paper straws
8:28 Arun's female version 😂😂 . One of the best needed inventions man hats off:)
So, what would happen if everyone on earth suddenly stopped eating meat? 1: The majority of animals that we eat would begin to multiply drastically beyond our control 2: The sudden burst of grazing animals like cows would lead to overgrazing in many areas 3: Especially on the edges of deserts like the Sahara, the lack of grasses and foliage would make the soil unstable leading to the expansion of the desert causing forests to shrink and less air filtration.
7:17 did u have to put that on the paper Arun?
man i love the outfit dude!!!!
Yupp
Very entertaining video with a lot of information to learn wow 🤩
But the plate is still wrapped in plastic
Very informative but I can’t find link of heul
"She literally cums when we stop recording" Where have I heard that?
bucket and mug bath in list where ?
What a great way to start the day. A new boss video.
Great Video Arun.
Hey arun that 'facon' detail in the corner of the screen was unique😆❤️
Best of this series so far
@Mrwhostheboss can you please review cosmo the robot?
Dont Be Racist I Am A Building
Tech burner did it before it was cool
this is a heavenly comment (i promise)
Im not watching your videos now you always rickroll me:(
So glad the algae are finally getting the spotlight they deserve!
Hey great video
50 000€ ? xD that's crap for 50 000€
Bruh what was in the XIAOMI box 😳😳😳
and drop a stupid seed on top of my house      or something       how can It grow
I'll bet the things he gives "10" outta 10 is something EXTREMELY expensive and actually available to the public. 2/10 for 31 million bottles removed from the ocean and turning them into clothing but 7/10 for a shower head. Anyone else notice this trend
I love this! Let’s try to make more of these videos focused on improving the world around us!☺️
Thats crazy
Cool outfit dude
so mrbeast only need just $10M not $20M
These puns are off the charts! - lol
mama i love you
Flip me over and call me a bumps and porpus i’ve never seen no person need a plate before? Wow Erin, you should really tell us how it taste like. Great video no less, if I have not seen it myself I would’ve called it bollocks if someone had tried to tell me about this.
Use me as a FACON meter like button
This just made this amazing video. And put the sponsor at the very end to not bother us and let us enjoy quality content 👏🏾
01:10 In German the combination of "ei" is pronounced like the letter "i". Regarding the first name, Joanna isn't a typical German name here in Germany and sounds very English, so I think your pronunciation was correct.
21th did what MrBeast wanted to do
Good
Hi
the outfit is Number 1 heavenly invention
You actually mentioning all these vegan options is great. It's the way to go, and should be standard by now.
Wow
yooo new update
okay look i tried to focus on the products but aruns outfit was too distracting smh
You should have come to dubai expo 2020 to see sustainable inventions and plans 👍
a happy video for once
OMG! Jesus Christ!
Last one I always think about🤔
l like how he dress up as jesus
Isn't Pineapple leaves used to harvest a new set of pineapples? so they aren't useless, right?
10:34 the text is cut
Very creative very cool
The wind tree system is dope!
Huel link doesn't work.
I never buy the worm    Because um........I like my cup a huge lot
you are telling me how this world could become a type 1 civilization instead of a type 0
Nice video . but arun the huel link in description is not working??!!
Rey charri
The first one is questionable. Clothing made out of plastic is called polyester or polyethylene. These materials take much longer than cotton to breakdown when in landfill and also leave traces of micro-plastic particles in the air and surrounding environment. They might be saving the ocean, but they are also adding another problem that will be much harder to fix.
this content is just wow..
Very wholesome video!
Now, this is a perfect video👍☮️ Share this video! And let’s get this video trending and let people know .And let’s restore this planet together into a heaven for all human beings!  Lovely inventions👌🏻♥️. More brilliant ideas yet to come✅👍.
Get your here within the hour ticket
love this video, keep it up bro, you doing good job, Thanks Arun
Such a nice and informative video, love it :)
When that Halloween costume comes in handy.
Another amazing video as expected. Keep it up👍🤩
BREITENHUBER 😂, not as bad as i thought you would speak the name.
The poo paper tho 😂
If you're only allowing visible spectrum in. I am afraid the sun light cannot do its usual heating job.
I really hope that the transparent solar panels work and skyrocket in popularity. With that in one year we could fully stop all use of fossil fuels as electricity source, because of the amount of windows we use.
There is no huel link none in description or in pinned comment
7:18 പുണ്യാളൻ അഗര്ബത്തീസ് അടുത്ത പാർട്ടിനു ഉള്ള കഥ ആയി
Arun i saw that at... 8:30.. u are a pro bro... Such tiny detail
Finally a plate which is used to eat also can be eaten 😂
Bruh this outfit is so extra 😂
Hey, Arun, these gadgets videos are really starting to get a bit annoying, since there's so many of them and the titles are getting increasingly more obnoxious  than before. Just a year earlier your videos were perfectly balanced, smartphone reviews, Smartphone gadget reviews and Tech fails. But now these random gadget reviews are getting in the way, and I think these are the reason you still haven't reviewed the Xiaomi 12 pro.
Amongus
17:24 21? lol
I hope Arun is waatching my comment...
Never thought in my life I ask for Arun jezus to become real and yet here we are
i wish money can grow on trees
"want to replace every piece oc flastic tableware"  is wrapped in what I assume to be plastic
mrwhosetheboss should make a podcast
the floor kinetic energy generator is amazing. Imagine putting those in bottlenecks where thousands people walk through everyday!
10:33 : is it an editing mistake?
Outro music Name please
Poo paper is from sri lanka
I watched a save ing the earth ad when watching this
I take a 10 seconds shower every day
I was really uncomfortable watching this video it was a really good topic for video but the dress made it so bad.
5:48 whatever happened to the metric system? Oh wait, you are catering to the US audience!
Me after watching thumbnail:- bruhh?!
In the next video you should try star wars theme..
My guy Niteesh recommended this and this is amazing.
Sick costume bruv👌
Pov: his leaf headband is made of plastic 💀
The biotrem plates, while being a good idea themselves, are kinda hypocrites for using plastic to wrap the plates
eating the plate as well as the food...odd..but good
Did anyone notice Arun's girlfriend at 8:29 ? He surely is sneaky.
Here I am with an electric shower and a chair .. sometimes I like to sit in the shower for 2-3 hours while I enjoy my wine lol
Hi
இனிய பொங்கல் திருநாள் நல்வாழ்த்துக்கள் ❤️👍

I love you 💖
"Saving the World." Oh, the arrogance of man!
this guy 7 years ago and now just lol
I just don't know why some vegans are trying to mimic non-vegan foods.
You can't tell me that the EcoCapsule isn't inspired by the houses in Dragon Ball
Did anyone notice that the edible plate is packed in plastic?
You are literally the best tech guy on any social media platform. I love how you just don't talk about the latest tech and what they can do but also talk about tech that makes sense, have practical use and most importantly tech that contributes in saving this planet..
Your voice sounds different…
sir how did you get the cut on your left hand
Big ass plastic bag for our sponsor 🖤
While the idea of vegan leather is nice if you look at the statistics on carbon emissions from production and waste byproducts it's actually worse for the environment.
Wait.a min what do you want if we made plastic road and produce enzyme that decompose plastic then they eat road
Its amazing how start ups have one common motive - To reduce pollution of any form  Kudos to them for the efforts even if it helps the planet a bit
17:23 "21 toxic tech fails" its 19 lol
Some of them aren't that great if you think about it. Soap bottles made of soap? Why not refillable? Plastic streets? No thank you, the constant friction will produce a fine dust of microplastic. And edible plates? Just use ceramic and rinse them like civilized people.
Sheeesh
The thumbnail was on another level
This is a TRUE tech channel.
I thought it was a scam type video 😆
Who the heck showers for 25 min lol😂 Also, i got to know this in early age through an ad and after that i don't use showers. I always use a bucket and mug for bathing. I only shower when i am feeling like burned cuz of the summer season.
nice Jesus costume btw

Loved your outfit 😂
Humans are the species that cut trees for papers and then write save trees on that paper
2:56 that isn't necessarily a good thing because yes algae does produce oxygen but not at night... they produce carbon dioxide at night at a very high rate since they don't get sunlight at that time
I think it would be better to call it levels instead of ratings because it might create some confusion. Like ratings are usually used to determine how good is the product, so giving it a low number would feel like it is a bad product. Instead, if we call it the level of epicness/level of fails, won't it suit better?
I just love how he dresses for his videos.
The title of this video should be '21 heavenly plastic inventions to save the world'.
cool
Idk why i like that outfit so much🤣🤣
Yay am early
14:06 Anybody else thought he was talking about team trees lol
4:09 7:09
heyyyyyyyyy 1 hour
6:41 ayoo😳
Is mrwhosetheboss gay?
going to veganism actually does not do very much to our  body. It is vey expensive as well. Veganism is just a commercial for companies. Just like Cigarette commercial of 60s -70s.
bro i lived in thailand for 3 years and they have poopaper all over the place cuz of elephants
Moto g :(((((((((((
Another 380k subs and he has 10mil subs
You have a cut on your hand... 😊
the plates coming in plastic wrapping made me kinda confused ngl
nukes
This man makes the best video. Pls Make Video Weekly bruv
I want more of such innovative video's... Makes me feel like the world is improving & becoming heaven in a good way... Hope so all the good THING'S come soon
😂
He’s a bit scant with what he offers these people as ratings who are trying to help the environment with eco-friendly inventions. I don’t see him in the lab inventing stuff he just sits on his high horse reviewing phones
please may you make a video about looking at your comments
Love the outfit ☺️ also very cool innovations
I get that you're supposed to be a saint or something but why are you dressed in Roman clothing?
Absolutely amazing
1:38 is it a magic wand? 😅
Jesus maini
Love this bluer theme. Keep it up man
Fun fact : Air Ink use the smoke from the generator which powers their factory
13:37 Me whose lactose intolerant
21 toxic tach fails when its 19 nice job (not offenceive in any way
yes
fix huel link in description
...
Great video, I do have questions though... What about the plastic road storing water inside of it and there is a deep freeze....  We know what happens when water freezes...
I guess Arun has recently watched lucifer
Where are you in the wold its 5:40 am
hi
I think he has got hands on with the mi 12 series because he got a special box from Xiaomi.
nice toga
Wish that huel also start packing it's content in a way that doesn't affect ecosystem!😊
insane vid
First one reminded me of Bellroy

I love your videos can I get a heart

Technology have it's benefits and drawbacks. But what's important is, if we used it properly and carefully, tech can literally save our whole world.
Um no 4 is a poor substitute to the convectional roads that are already one of the most recycled materials we use
New upload
Loved it❤
It's pronounced yonna Britenhuber
I would like to give you this 4:77 crown
godammit!! that elephant shitty thing is known as cardboard🤣🤣 and if u use that for cleaning your ass.. then either that will give u bruises or after a use stays there with ur ass😂😂
Emperor Arun is here giving us techs to save humanity
I like how the videos are getting a little more personal Also, the outfit was spot on:))))
Love from Bangladesh, Mr Maini! Such a nice presentation skill and tone you got.
What about the packing of the products. Like the rice bran plate. It's 8times less polluting but they are packed with cardboard, sealed with plastic inside
The Pavegen is straight out of the Rick and Morty episode where Rick's vehicle is actually powered by a mini universe inside its battery.  Peace among worlds!
I love the clothes that you wore in that video, looks amazing!!!!!
Indians using leaf plates for centuries: Ha, weak!
Love your videos
This video came under the superheroes tab in YouTube. I guess it's right
God bless Arun Christ
Give me a phone 😙☮️
I absolutely love this! I wish more youtubers will follow you and make these kind of things known!
Very nice thumb nail
Haha yes!
Me seeing jisus christ for 17 min straight.
Yes
.
Great video concept! This kinda video is better than regular tech one and it help people think abt caring more abt our dear earth.  Keep on,MWTB!
Waiting for the 10 million special surprise video that you've planned for us.....
Did you buy this plastic olive wrath just for this one video?
4:09 Give the editor a raise! 😂
Really hope we save the planet and bring it to its best life
The solar panel one is soooooooo coooooool👍👍👍

Hi
The quality of the videos is improving with every upload. I cannot imagine how much time he spends on each and every minute detail to keep the video interactive, cool looking and informative. There's so much going on the screen. Simply awesome!  Edit: 273 likes! Thank you so much. The only thing that'll make this even crazier is a like from Arun himself 😍😍
The plastic Roads ere going to be super slippery in the winter
4:00  In italy, some restaurants, are using a special tipe of pasta called Bucatini, as replacement for straws. As Italian i love this initiative :)
If God was Arun.. i'd convert.
Howszit
Yeh Banda YouTube ke Paise Poory Kar Deta Hai.
17:24 after the 9+10 kid, the confusion of 19 and 21 sounds intentional.
I feel like crap right now, these videos help a lot. <3
Helloooooooo
Human stupidity lead us to where we are now. Wonderful!
Kind of early
Pavegan Is just charging the battery in Rick's space car
When are you doin oneplus10
8:28 MisswhoseTheBoss 😂
Didn't like the video came across as slightly preachy and there were some facts you got wrong which is fine in tech but you should be more accurate when talking about more serious topics
the puns are very punny
Good one, divine 👏 🙌 ✨
Am I the only one who wants to have the Ecocapsule with a roof made of transparent solar panel ?
I wonder why do we have to watch a 20sec long ad to access your video? I mean you tech channels are already earning insane because of us watching your videos. Not hating just addressing a universal issue.
I love the outfit
nice
Only one comment- You need better clothing man
the god himself is back with the heavenly uploads
Love YouR VIDEOS ARUN. HAVE BEEN SEEING ThEm siNCE 3 YEARs NoW!
A heavenly invention would be a thing that makes me heterosexual. These are just trash.
How many of you know god had an angel for tech.  😊😊
I think the wind tree, the shine powerbank, the biotrem, and the air ink is pretty Inkcredible
OP Thumbnail ❤️
Arun, I believe with your videos, a lot can be changed in the world. You have a lot of inspiration and well thought out ideas and you strategically bring them to life in these few minutes videos. Thank you for your impact in man kind..❤️❤️❤️
What's he wearing?! 🙂
Bath from a bucket and it will save water.
PONGAL SPECIAL VEDIO TAMILAN
Here before an hour
Google: is mrwhostheboss Muslim? Video: Bacon in his fridge 😂
I have one of the wind tree in front of my local théatre and i never realised that it was producing energy.
*12:21** MASSIVE* * *FOR EVERYONE SEEING THIS ONE* This won't work for roads because the amount of foundations needed and wearrates. But it would for bike paths. Just need that put there
Fml was there really like 6 ads on this video 🙄
I really live these videos, well done! I do have a couple of questions..  1: the wind turbine tree idea, how much dos it produces, how sturdy are they, and what are its limits as to where you can place them.  2: the plastic roads, while we use roads we create micro fibers of plastic that are washed into nature by the weather. Wouldn't it make unfilterable plastics in nature worse by using it? Also how durable is it actually?   I thinks those are my questions for now😇
ye
4:30  That vegan Teacher be like: ooh i really like this guy's thoughts!!! LOL, anyways No offense to anyone or anycreator, this is just a Meme!
The last invention is pure genius 🔥
Respect to this man he can rick roll us with a poo also

I agree that planting trees is a great thing to do and I think that we should do more of it and did you know that 50-90 percent of oxygen is made by coral I might be wrong on the percentage
YOUR Catching Skill are another level Xd
This dude is a scripting machine! Very nice content! Congrats also to your MemeLord editor!
Imma1st
Thank you for this series!
hiiiiii
damn these looks cool
I thought Arun's next video would be  Review of  👉 OnePlus 10 pro 👉 Xiaomi 12 pro 👉 S21 FE  Or 👉 Vivo V23 Pro  But it is about inventions 😍😍🔥
Biotrem: an alternative to plastic plates wrapped in... plastic ._.
this gives me hope in humanity.
Why not use metal straws?
This guy makes tech interesting
i love your kami sama(god)cosplay 😂
Global warming dude
hi

hey, NICE GODLY clothes, they look heavenly
1:55 yeet the mushroom box And im a mariofan too this made my day
I live these videos
The reason many people aren't going to change to help the environment is not because they don't want to!! it's because they can't, many "environment friendly" products are really expensive for the average person or business to use, for example the biotrem plate costs 30$ for 100 plates, while 100 plastic plates cost 8$. the problem is that many vegans and eco friendly people blame others for not helping the environment while normal individuals have bigger problems like feeding their children or sending them to college. and many of the things aron listed in this video are still in development phase. but am not saying aron is a bad guy or vegans and eco friendly people are, but they have enough money for themselves that they have leverage to support the environment by buying expensive stuff
It is the cloak for me🔥💯💯🔥
Cooooooool
I don't understand Arun's tierlist, but the items itself are dope
Hello
Nope. Plastic roadways possibly good for footpaths but as a mainroad infrastructure? Nope. Yeah nah. Id rather the world burn than give up real bacon
Number 1 cups
Aruns effort is evident, by pumping out quality every week. The detail in the set is heavily appreciated as well. ❤️ Mrwhosetheboss
7:13 The rickrolls getting louder🤣
No choice, I have to score distinction in EVS now... I already know too much about plastic waste management.
Jesus Christ is that you??
Sorry I love steak too much to go vegetarian
Mrwhosetheboss dressing like Jesus in the thumbnail made my day😊
The ratings are so subjective and seem so useless. I would get rid of them in all of your videos. Nice vid though
‘Put this back in my cloud storage’ cracked me up
Algee
Saw the whole video, and now I want to buy Huel. Everything on point. Great job boss.
Is 50.000 euros a few for a house?
Arun, how do you choose the perfect words needed in a video? A reply to this comment would be...heavenly..?
Very informative and detailed video as usual! I love how the backgrounds change according to the theme and I admire the amount of effort put into each video. You are seriously educating so many people about new kinds of technologies by making it interesting.:)
126062 views and 19K+ likes in one hour only . congratulations
That plastic road is an awesome idea!
I have a question...🙄 If the ink company uses compounds in the air so we can just burn all the plastic and make ink🤔🤔
I don’t give a sh*t about anything in this video but that heavenly dress up.
I agree that bacons good but we have had vegan bacon for a while and we actually have a solar cooker I like these things that he’s showing great jod
The videos are top quality but I request you to make more videos.  Quality is greater than quantity but quantity is also important.
I love ur vids arun :) wait wtf a worm-
Kaami samq🔥
what about guilt-free meat in singapore???
THIS MAN IS A LEGEND xD
Another great tech video🌋
Who here likes minecraft?
I never knew how much water I was wasting lol. I shower for 40 minutes
4:07 That's what she said 😅
Who here likes minecraft?
Just wanted to tell you plastic road is not a good idea cause due to traffic wear and tear it generates micro plastic which is not treatable and causes further problem
Uff.. that off-shoulder top! 10/10 🔥
Heave
Fun fact: This guy makes so positive content that I leave him to talk in the background when I'm playing some games
Mrwhosetheboss: "You can eat this wheat plate" Cassava's plate in Malaysia: "Am I a joke to you?"
sheesh
He should definetly make a bloopers channel
The poo paper was made by sri lanka 🇱🇰
you just wanted a reason to put on this outfit
Hats off to Xiaomi...This is what you should do to save the environment...Not like some other shttyy companies...who throws out the charger from the box in the name of environmental protection
Mr. Beast needs to watch this
Most fucked up video. Dislike 👎🏼
when hes talking im waiting for the bacon to cook
.
Pretty cool inventions… Just don’t ever expect me to be a vegan 🌱
man O man ur look is dopee lol
Seeing so many world saving inventions has really made my day thank you so much <3
17:24 oh noes, number wrong! (i bet ill be in the .1% of people who would actually notice that because people turn off for the sponsored part)
Too bad plastic is bad for humans. It messes with our growth hormone and other unknown consequences that haven't been fully studied
You need to know more about perfect day , vegan company
1:05 oh yeah be careful that somebody might think something "wrong" about you using those products... 🙄
I wanted to buy the shower thing... Went to their website and realized that a single shower head is 120$. Nope
Does anyone know where that jacket is on repreve? I love it!
Great search & wonderful job
I've always expected Arun to be god one day , here it is.
Have of these things are some of the dumbest things I've ever seen
why am I so addicted to his channel nowadays?
These videos are so well made, I cannot compare any other channel with yours
Arun, your heul link is not click-able
No words for Thumbnail 🤫  Superb.....
GODLY VIDEO🔥
FUCK TURTLES BRING ME BACK MY PLASTIC STRAW
humans:spend millions of dollars and time to barely make a dent in the plastic problem  mealworm:look what they need to mimic a fraction of our [power
I Love ur content ,I have been watching you for a long time, but seriously hats off  . Get it , beacause in the past u always wear a hat
Can't wait to see you hit 10 Million subscribers.
He really likes his girl face huh XD
U are the only youtuber for whose videos i am waiting for
who else is here from the insane tease on insta? 😂
Didn't expect Jesus here
His shoulder made me uncomfortable  xD
i already use biotrem
The way editor edits and masks is just on different level!  Also number 14 is left bold.
Remarkable ☑️
These are amazing. Some hope for the future has been restored. Lol
Technology and Innovation alon will not save humanity Real intension is what it is required
10/10 for the costume
I feel like a lot of these products could be debunked by thunderf00t
HOLY SMOKES?!?! the costume suits you😇
you look gae in that dress...and vegans are gae .. vegetables also has life but they are mute...so you are killing mute 🤐 so sad for vegans
6:47 hella sus
I thought it was gonna be awfull bull$#!t but this is great
Sometimes i wonder how people come up with these stuff like did someone really sit down and think "what would happen if i boil elephant 💩?"
Nice outfit Arun 😊
But huel uses plastic as bags and as bottles too
Yayyyyyyyy before 1h
Wow
It's nice 👍👍👍
Really cool man
I cannot stress how good the algae one is. Algae is the absolute best way to suck carbon dioxide so having them in our buildings means we are doing more than planting trees and at a faster rate
the thumnail get me😭😭😭
The solar panels on number 1 actually have a flaw. The flaw being that only the sun"light" will pass through the window and not the heat that accompanies the light because it is the infrared(which is not visible to the human eye) part of the spectrum that carries most of the heat. This will lower the temperature inside the area covered by these transparent panels, which can be a deal breaker in many cases.
Maybe earth isn't doomed for a slow painful death and loss of biodiversity after all with an increasing temperature leaving a ball of flames in the next couple of centuries.
Its not likely to throw pineapple , its a food item.😃
It axes
Always waiting for your videos  Keep inspiring
6:47 that's what she said.
Where is the huel link?
I love your invention reviews a lot, the editing is out of this world! Good job Arun!
great vid
I just want Arun to make a poll for audience...whether he should make videos of computers,laptops, and all other tech!!!
I love your content so much, that I even enjoy watching adds and sponsored messages
Bro what they doing to my leaves 😬
Regarding solar panel have you researched about their lifetime and whether they can be recycled or safely dispose of?
Risk Astely is Great
Dont the plastic clothes from repreve and others break down in the wash and produce microplastics which are arguably worse?
Your videos are Heavenly🔥
Loved the outfit 😂
Are bhai ranveer Singh Kab se ban Gaye 🤣🤣
I don't know what to say, but i really loves every of your videos. I always waiting for new videos every weeks like i'm waiting my fav anime series. Your videos are the best!!! Fan from Malaysia😍😍
*Look like Ladies for this dress🤭*
7:16… My man rickrolls us all every time he uploads, and I don’t think it is going to stop anytime soon
Lost focus a bit at 6:49 and found myself thinking about @markbennett's gorgeous face.
I hope that all these incredible tech inventions become popular and cheap cause we have only one home and it's better to conserve and protect it
The way you speak makes the thing 100% much better
Don’t believe all the fakery and scammery from Billy Gates freak. Our planet needs more carbon than it has. ✌️
i make cool vids too
gg very good video
Uhhh, Where is the Huel link?
e
If arunus Cesar was my ruler I would pay tax every year
I like all the stuff that replaces plastic but why is the eatable plate wrapped in plastic
17:23 You said it wrong. It's 19 Toxic Fails but you said 21 😀
That outfit tho😆🤣🤣👌
noise
Thumbnail was awesome.❤️
You've did a lot of promises in this video 🤨
Hmmmm, very interesting.
The best thumbnail ever
what is the point of vegan meat they go vegan for A reason
I'm sorry you did not just rate a straw higher than a plant chandelier
The most importance is availability and cost of this inventions. We couldn't be able save environment if absolute 80% of people can't afford live eco, and also comfortable life
It's an awesome presentation dear....
love the coustume
6:20 Why is my mind so dirty 🤣🤣🤣
Can we get the Huawei p50 pro review cuz it had it's own global launch
I hope that if companies like repreye go out of business it’s because they can’t find and bottles
nice one man. keep em comingm
can we just appreciate how cleanly he caught those shampoo bottles
"That's what she said"
Not gonna lie this is my most favourite tech channel ❤
Someone show his channel on news and to the government of major countries  That would be ARUNLY (Bcoz his videos are godly and he lives on a cloud and stores items in cloud storage)
Arun has rickrolled us so much to the point where I am like “Wait there’s no rickrolls? weird, that’s unusual for Arun”
i'm honestly loving this new type of content,keep at it. we need more ignorant asF people to see this shiz,i'm sure we 've quite a few smarties watching your videos,hope these types even get some know;ledge into their brain about using theirs for THESE STUFF-the REAL IMPORTANT STUFF, HONETSLY MAN,THANKS
No one can even dislike his videos. He is toooooo good
Well let's hope we do good
That zstraw is such a dumb idea. Who is going to carry that round with them + want to wash it and dry etc
Great vid
Dude, great job
Is 8:29 your girlfriend, Arun?!
39 minutes ago
Amen
Please do more videos like this, it's the most beautiful I've ever seen ❤️❤️
While everyone is watching these inventions i am thinking where did he found this outfit 🤔🤔
10 million giveaway
Don't throw the pineapple like that ✌️
Is that FACON halal 😳
Ive used the poo paper
Where is the Huel link??
I might add that although plastic roads are a good idea arent we just incrrasing the problem because as there is friction of the tyres against the road we are just producing thoudands of microplastics on the road
Thank u for making my day better!
The Transparent Solar Panels sound about as useful as Solar Roads: they are more expensive and less efficient than normal solar panels. So why should they be used, when most houses still don't have normal solar panels on them?
Man literally got 100 000 views in 30 minutes!!! Thats insane
Vegan Teacher would be proud of mrwhosetheboss for 13th and 14th
Do u need to tell us that u got a child cause there were way to many dad jokes
Your costume is amazing 😂😂
Lovely ❤️
His videos are the only videos that i intentionally looking for rick rolls!!😂😂
Why is it that saving the world is so expensive?
I love like none of them is made by elon
There is too a system called « orbital system shower » that use only 5l of water per shower so combine this and nebia moen and boom super economic shower 😍
im honestly excited to see this video
Big fan here. Would be lovely if i could get a heart 👉👈
I your biggest fan is here
9:08  nice one
Minimum buy (huel) 2 bags. Idt so……sorry
Like the lit outfit🔥🔥
Hey Arun are you gonna do a Mi 12 review?
4:12 Dude, you took it out of a plastic bag.
who's that girl in @8:30 ??
Who agrees that Arun is looking gorgeous?  Don't really check out men but this man! In this attire! Whistle !!
Aron is in Tech Heaven ! 👼
Thanks tech Jesus. You really saved the world for me.
the shower thing is cool
Can you stop giving these retarded ratings? Its sooo unnacessary
Hello
I felt so happy and assuring that the technology which is on the verge of destroying the nature is going to heal the damage it has done and help the nature heal on its own.
You intro costume was amazing you looked like god
I love the dedication
Aight... The videos dope and all but the Jesus drip making his trap muscle look really nice... I can see he's been working out.... As a gym bro I'm proud
I used to shower... Sorry, I mean I used to bath with bucket and mug to save water 😁  The transparent glass is a brilliant idea. Can see in future smart devices might have one 😌
The best invetion will be something to cure that fucking virus but it's chemistry and medeical so
My question though is this. How much does all of this cost? Most of the vegan food iv seen costs much more than the standard. And the home alone while cool, we can build bigger tiny houses for that price. Going green costs much more green and that's something a lot of people don't have.
I don't know why but your thumbnails are becoming cringier
No.9 due to the laws of entropy not all the energy you put in will go into your food there will be inevitable energy loss
Team trees used these drones
Your videos hit different 💙
Alright His T shirt is my new favorite
Great content
i love how he uses the most amazing words so we can sub
How do u catch all of them so easily 🤧
Ask these are good but I hardly see them in action
nice super inventions 👍👍👍👍👍👌👌👌👌❤❤❤❤
PLEASE! don't wear that ever again.
You look like a Greek god! I love it.
Dude wawa shout out me pls
Like you have lipase to breakdown the milk *chokes on the milk
Vegan Cringe & stupid.
8:09 , am I the only one who instantly thought about bitcoin mining? xd
You always seem to find a way to rickroll us..
Trackmania players when they reach 12:19 ,  Oh yeah, it’s all coming together now
On 19th already in awe
Man,this video was amazing!
Claim your Before 30mins ticket Here ↓
Nice T-SHirt
This guy is highly underrated, like get this man to 20million subscriber's. He deserves it Also I'm not a bot, it feels as if i am but im not
Wew
Mrwhosetheboss: "This is an amazing invention. I cannot explain how cool this is"  Also Mrwhoosetheboss: "4 out of 10"
You should have put the prices of these products vs the normal products
To the first one: What about Microplastic
Cleans and pickups 30B bottles from ocean, makes them into clothes 2/10 Straw 5/10 Arun? wtf bro XD
Thanks Arun! 😍 Would you mind adding links to these projects?
Plastic road shouldn't have got the 4 place coz when plastic is used to make roads, roads are always in a constant state of abrasion... The plastic that is in the road will  be reduced to smaller plastic(microplastic), which is bad bcoz this microplastic can float in the air and reach our lungs easily and cause chronic lung disease. It poses a major threat to other creatures. Making roads with plastic is a temporary solution.
YEah
I love the toga more than the suit t-shirt
One of these days he's going to have the actual Rick Astley on the show
I was waiting for you to upload
What about eat just
Is I am the only one or really there are 5 ad in this video and all are the same promotion of Motorola
as a beginner youtuber your content is very good (sorry for bad english)
10:10 That's wrapped in plastic lol
omg fake bacon halal muslims need to try it
That's what she said🤣🤣🤣
I think Piezoelectricity is the right term  for the energy generating tile.
dont like the thumbnail doe
Arun, you out do yourself!🙌🏿
12:07 A reason to exercise more :)
I have been waiting like a night owl for a new video, amazing execution!! You never and never will disappoint me
Machane ne mass alle!!  Powlikku aadhane
I feel... holy
What is he wearing???
So.. do you recycle their clothes after they've been shredded by timely use?
Arun dressed as jesus is the funniest thing ever 😂
Absolutely love these fun/tech videos 💯
Arun in 2022: 21 Heavenly Inventions that will save the world. Arun in 2026: 21 Inventions that will save this universe. Arun in 2050: 21 Inventions that will save this existence.
Those top 3 inventions have the potential to change the world but the problem is that only 3 in 5 developing countries are willing to accept them.... Which makes it harder for  the countries which are actually willing to make the world a better place .... :(
Very Informative video but, I would just like to address one point regarding Plastic Roads. As vehicles/pedestrians move over them they are subject to wear and tear due to frictional and other forces. This will create micro-plastics and nano-plastics that will be carried by water/rainfall into drains followed by water bodies and oceans. So they have their issues. That's it. Thank you. Love your videos and reviews.
You should have said "A sub to the channel would be "ink"credible.
Yeah it's all great and so on.. But WHO TF TAKES 25 MINUTES SHOWERS!? 😂
ok
Cool kitchen
Because of this video, i actuqlly wanna by some stuff, if you continue this series about these topics, imma get broke :'(
click the purple photo  😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
16:20 cameraman after shooting por*n!! XD
I swear I don't have any issues with any brands but this Motorola ad sucks 🤬
i consume your informaition and feed it to others
Great theme bro 🤣❤️
Top 3 are literally amazing
Thank me by liking 00:16 : Repreve 00:56 : Soapbottle 01:35 : Mushroom Packaging 02:08 : Wind Tree System 02:31 : Biohybrid Chandelier 03:05 : Biohybrid Buildings 03:37 : Zstraw 04:26 : Facon 05:04 : Vegan Leather 05:48 : Nebia Moen 06:50 : Poo Paper  TOP 10 07:42 : Shine 08:26 : Gosun Fusion 09:12 : Ecocapsule 09:52 : Biotrem 10:59 : Air Ink 11:27 : Pavegen 12:14 : Plasticroad 12:57 : Mealworms 13:50 : Tree Planting Drones 14:47 : Transparent Solar
14:29 f you do some maths you'll get this so one drone can plant 20k a day say a single one costs 2k for the drone its self and also the maintaining of each drone. The government decides to buy 10k of these drones 10,000 x 2,000 = 20,000,000 10,000 x 20,000 = 200000000 every single day. An average tree takes up 5 - 2 metres to grow properly 5 meters times 200,000,000 = 1,000,000,000 metres. In miles that's 621371.2 in a single day. Revolutionary huh?
Who noticed he is wearing team seas 🌊 t-shirt
I saw the rick roll
Solutions, rather than whinging about the problem?  ☑️ Check. Like and subscribed? Check. ☑️

Just WOW!🤯🤩
6:47 Ayoooo, u good bro?
Idk why but I feel like the worms will evolve and eat us if we increase their thing @mrwhostheboss said
Haven't played the video yet but why do the leaves look like butt plugs on the thumbnail??
He still wears team seas t shirt
I always believed that we always polluted our world and people will talk about it and not do something about it. Now, i see that I was wrong cause after watching this, my perspective of life has changed
i need that t shirt...
Arun to save the day
Just noticed that he gave a graphical representation of how much the facon has been cooked at the bottom right corner 😂
mrwhosetheboss is the goat of tech youtuber 🐐🐐🐐🐐
Awesome channel! Could you make videos also related to laptop reviews?
6:00 - Running the water in the shower for 25 continuous minutes sounds rather excessive
Tell me when these products become as cheap as their plastic counterparts.
ehh is it me or did you forget the link to your sponsor huel? Doubt they will be very happy with this....
Is no one gona ask how he rick rolled us using the poo paper?
Really queen? 🤨
Plastic roads are more dangerous because they contribute a large amount of micro plastic into water bodies. Whenever vehicles run on them they wear out and become dangerous micro plastic.
Hiiiiii finally I was waiting thank to u
😳
I knew for a long time that we can only see a certain part of the spectrum but never even imagined of solar panels that can harness the energy from those waves...
his costume killed me lol
Mrwhosetheolympian
He is the master of Rick rolls
The Thumbnail is mad bruv😂
Fusion Energy
and cant even use "all" the geniuses its talking off
THAT'S IS INCREDIBLE👍😍🤩🤩
Jesus arun 😆😜.
Are you copying "TechBurner" ?
Great video
Hi Arun
.
Is that how all British people say algae or does he just say it weird?
12:44 what happens in the winter??
coooooooooIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII........................
I'm not sure about that poo paper...
the best DIY way to save shower water is to just get a small plastic cap to put on your drain(s). if its a sunday and you have time, you can easily just fill up your shower cabinet, making it a bathtub

You are a 'tech entertainer' from now on. Your content is way high above than other tech youtubers. truly a tech god
mmmm a loose fitting toga on Aron so sexy....
MrWhoseTheHumanitarian
dude veganism is not a good idea it can cause health problems for a lot of people
4:09 that's what
I knew he was Asgardian
When you talk about Infinix?

I wonder how many bloopers you guys would've had with that frankly ridiculous outfit xD! Loved the vid as usual; you guys are really pushing the quality you can get in a YT vid, Arun!
was waiting for u r vid....<3
When you jumped on the bed I thought you were a god for a moment. Oh wait that’s right you are a god making all these wonderful videos with your friends
Arun to the world!🔥
Mrbeast X reprieve best idea
LOL ARUN AS JESUS
I feel that the plastic road you mentioned is quite a bad idea (assuming it is used on actual roads).  Plastic is soft, right? So could it endure the weight of a car? Also, lots of plastic items warn to keep them out of sunlight; how would sunlight affect the roads? Could the friction from even just walking on it create microplastics?
milk
Anyone know where I can get the repreve jacket?
Ur opinion on one plus 9rt
Every gosun owner: The power of the sun in the palm of my hand
Hi arun! You are the best YouTuber ever!
..
I love your vids!! They are interesting and really funny. Keep up the hard work!!!
The thumbnail got me...😂✌️And your outfits perfectly matches with the theme of ur videos...🌟
Wow,i cant beleieve the government is telling me to shower -2 minutes a day
Hey @mrwhosetheboss you forgot to add your sponsored link.
Simply amazing!
Best tech channel
Nice Outfit... You are really awesome😍
0:53 just put back in my cloud storage 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My man dressed as Jesus 😂 🙌
Saving the leather from what???? though and garantee that its still a hell of alot cheaper. . . . .
🤣😀 - amazing constume ! 🤘
I loved the Heavenly theme and what technology is saving the planet! You should definitely do a video that talks about the things that we are doing that harm the earth that we don't even realise (E.g. Buying a new phone every year, Buying too many accessories for your phone I.e plastic cases, etc)  I think it could be really cool and It could collaborate with the "Tech Fails" series as you could explain that there was a tech fail that harmed the planet more when it was meant to save it like a car that tried to "save the planet" by running on 4000 AA Batteries idk
Arun really wore a heavenly "costume"for this video😂
Waiting for this.....video from a long time
Bruh💀
Greenwashing/10
Please make videos on upcoming smartphones
50,000 euro is cheap yah I want to be that poor
Im so excited to see those inventions....
arun being jesus
11:05 There you have a cat loaf 🍞
🥳🥳
The world does need saving ripppp
my mum has vegan leather boots
14:30 don't you mean helicopter parents
#8 it would really suck losing your phone and you get locked out of your egg house. Bummer.
The amount of costume you have that look real but fake is probably over 1000.
Hope someone can click this video in like 2040-2050 and say "yes, we've done that!"
When he said I tried to climb the tree I swear I dead 😂🤣
let's be honest how many of had a mental image of arun  climbing tthat tree in his apron?

One thing you could've talked about is lab-grown meat
Does Huel have physical stores? I wanna try them out but I cannot and have no idea how to make online transactions things.
No
Very good 👍😊
Today's theme looks great.  And that costume  😍
Wind is actually a pretty cool energy source, because it can work anywhere and anytime. Sun hides at night or can die altogether, water can dry out, coal sources will disappear, but wind? Wind is there to stay. Any planet, any conditions.
Sponcer link is not proper Arun, check it
Was expecting you to explain what you are wearing 😂. Couldn't find them in the video. What are you wearing?😂😂😂 Is it just for the heavenly experience?😂😂😭😭😭😭
The amount of dedication and efforts you put into these videos is astounding. I found your channel years ago when you collaborated with Ash from c4etch. I've been a subscriber since that day. Your channel has grown, a lot! Your production quality is so amazing that I'm surprised with every video you put online. It doesn't feel like I'm watching a generic tech YouTube video, it feels like I'm watching a mini tech documentary. Hats off to you and your team Arun. I wish you all the best ❤️  Never gonna give you up
Next prehistoric tech
A sub to the channel would  be angelic, electrifying, amazing... I forget other glowing adjectives I've heard here. So I subscribed lol.
So, you think human leadership can save the planet?
Mr beast is now out of business because of this
Plastic roads are a joke, at least with what its current design is capable of. The idea and concept is great but not with its current design.
Hi
Are all the claims scientifically verified ?
Jesus Arun Is Here To Save Us All Guys!!!!
A sub to the channel will be God-amm-it
can anyone give the link for each invention?
cool
Thanks for the video
The Poo paper is the funniest one.
My faith in humanity is restored...! for now
haha uploading less because of your GF hunh?! lol stay happy
I have like 30 years worth of plastic straws in my house. I'm good with not using paper, metal any of that shit.
Is the Piñatex based in the Philippines? 5:03
Arun's dress is 🤣🤣
basically vegan leather is big company's way of not having to put fake leather on their packaging, even though that's exactly what it is.
Our tech god is here!!!
Came here from da insta teaser!
no matter what video this man makes he will always find a way to rickroll us,what a man
Nice clothing
Hey are you wearing a TOP 🤣🤣
4:09 "that's what......" 😅you didn't finish!!! (Captain America voice)
damn it, im 25 mins late, sorry arun
Noice video
plastic roads has already been debunked
He could literally save my day no my liifeee when he gifts me a ipad mini 6 256GB
Lol wtf are you wearing 🤣
What a coincidence a company called droneseed is the same as the flash forest company
You only use the hide from cows that go to slaughter you dont kill a cow for its hide then bin the rest
Hmmm I am too late  I want to do first comment in your video
Mr Whose the Messiah. 🎅✝️✝️
Best tech youtuber
It's not a mistake it's a ✨ masterpiece ✨
Big ups Arun!
But, who is that guy? 🧐🧐🧐
1:29 .that soap bottle will melt/degrade in my shower 🚿 before I could finish my shampoo.
Hey Arun, what is that top, you are wearing? :) No matter what you wear, you are very well known to us, so no formal dressing is required!
the greek boss
Arun becomes Mykonos
e
Most of these are nonsense.
really excited for what the future holds for humanity, got to clear the mess we have created.
Writing what you say makes this video look like an ad
Huel seems like it can help me out. I've been struggling to maintain my weight after losing 160 (gastric sleeve). It's been hard fitting enough calories and nutrients a day with such a small stomach.
The best outfit of the eternity
These are so fucking awesome 🤯🤯🤯🤯💥💥💥💥
Congratulations fr 1 million ❤️❤️
sorry but who showers 25mins long?
This video series could be a rewatched by Arun after a year or so to make a tech fails video 🌚
Hello Mr boss
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm oki :|
You are always full of energy, great expression, right words, cool content and fluency. I think you must be ideal for many including me ☺️
Nice outfit
Arun's shoulders tho
10:34 what happened to EAT 🤣🤣
Next video will be regarding Xiaomi
Can you review the Nokia 3.4
Rey adavi🙄🤦🏻‍♂️
💙
Nice
the amount of dedication u put into videos is frickin insane man. maddd respect to u and ur team. wish u more success!!
Poo paper is like a  main thing in my country which by the way is Sri Lanka
Arun really worked hard for that theme, appreciate his effort
Let's talk about the good side
cool
nice costume!!! xD
Let's be honest it doesn't taste same as beacon. That's like saying we have eco friendly car but you need someone to push it from behind all the time
10:00 his crown is slipping
subtle rickroll. i like it.
this actually restored my faith in humanity. Thank you Arun
I like your tshirt! Nice gold chains.
It's the thumbnail for me😂
5:07 I would point out fake leather made this way has existed for a very long time they just rebranded it as vegan so they can charge double and pay the farmers no more more.
Saw that rick roll. 🙄 (7:10)
Love this video
early
1:08..I promise its not mine 🤣🤣
Did he say 24 hours a day??
it kinda feels illegal to be this early to a vid of urs
I've used elephant poo toilet paper in a zoo once, it was actually good surprisingly
plastic roads are very bad for the enviroment because they result in a lot of microplastic.
Nice
e
Pls heart me i am ur biggest fan 💓
4:20 Why can't we just sip from the glass ?
6:48  🤨🤨
This is the earliest I have made it to his videos.
And if you looked and liked my comment, a like would be... HEAVENLY
I'm just here to appreciate the amount of time and research done by Arun to produce this. You inspire small tech content creators like me to do better. 🙏
5:38 doesnt making vegan leather also produce carbon from all the machine?
But his costume tho, I thought it was only for his thumbnail, but i see him wearing it and I can't stop laughing😂
Aren't divine and godly same?
I don't think I've squinted as many times as I did watching this! Everything sounds so weird and out of place, but somehow, Arun always brings sense back into them.
What's that ur wearing ??
I cannot believe mrwhosetheboss dressed up as jesus
Mrwhoosetheboss video- 10/10
I am completely wowed 🤯
Can you do more of those toxic fail’s videos
Best tech YouTuber.
First
I liked the chandelier too soon
your rick rolling is out of this world
I have on question: how can you get that outfit?
omg the theme....awesome man.. next time try something like classic theme.✌🏻
At this point I only live to get Rick rolled by arun in EVERY SINGLE VIDEO
I love the video but there is no way in hell i will use poop paper😂😂
at the pineapple part>  It really does give you hope>  "also throws the pineapple"😅
Love you brother
This vid is so good
Also there is a small company in Mexico that is making a leather substitute from Cactus leaves and apparently it looks and feels like leather.
I like how Arun is putting so much effort in the details, I mean ,he even dresses according to the theme
Hey  What are u wearing exactly??
Noice clothes
I can replace 15. I found a foldable metal straw once at a store. It actually worked rly well I saw someone using it and then just folded it up afterwards.
Look at the dripp tho and that chain
The dedication you put into these vids are astonishing. I know you will never give us up or let us down.
These videos are really well researched and informative, but please point at the screen just a little less. It got really distracting this time, and now I fear I can't enjoy the rest of your videos without noticing it. Your ideas and presentation style is great without it! :)
Best costume
Poo 💩 paper 📃  do not give this to a spy or bad politician
The first one is really just marketing. Almost all nylon based fabrics are made from recycled plastics. They're not doing anything new there. Fourth one is also not a great idea. Wasting a lot of resources for minimum energy efficiency, seeing how small they are and how slow they turn.
hi
my new favourite youtube video
sorry but UK doesn't give 2 shits about pollution and anyone can see this  vintage cars are allowed on the road with no road tax or mot  electric scooters are illegal ebikes are limited to a stupid 15.5 mph speed  recycling is almost non existing and everything gets mixed in landfill at the end  etc etc the list goes on  the government in UK ia full of corrupted old rich people who don't give 2 shits about pollution or the future of the young generations   why going to work for £0.10 on an electric scooter when you can burn £2 worth of taxable fuel and thers your answer why because government doesn't make money if you are very efficient
"unfortunately, plastic straw end up in animals" -Arun 2022        If you didn't get it... good
It's not a mistake it's a ✨ masterpiece ✨
A video idea: Why not attempt a Hellish version of the same with tech that pollute the world the most ?
Is Pinatex known internationally? I'm surprised and glad it was mentioned here. I also heard about leather made in cactus...
Damn Arun, that's a heavenly OUTFIT 😂
Okay but if paperstraws are getting wet and soggy then why not just coat them with hydrophobic substances? they wont get wet and still be usable for a good while.
Great video as always would want to see Extra Terrestrial or Alien tech next
Use buckets to bath, going back to time also can be a solution for many problems
Just love ur videos
17:23 that's 19 not 21 😂😂 Btw, I can never comprehend how video quality keeps getting better
get a load of this guy
We need unboxing video about mi 12 ultra
I really Loved The Video And The Getup Specially But, Youtube WTH, & ADs And all were same in 1 video :v

Nice video! Thank you for information 📱👍
I do like before I start watching, coz I know every video of Arun is just perfect
Just one little correction: the name of the german product designer is actually jonna breitenhuber not joanna. Really enjoyed the video. Keep up the good work!

I expected 22 ...to make it 22 in 2022 😅
im a mistake a failure and useless 😄
Well lets just say that this video "recharged me from humanity"         This is one of the worst puns that i created.  And also great video, great editing and one of the most if not the most entertaining content
You look good in that ! 10/10
My wish is to join you in one of your videos😭😭😭😭 such a big fan
Putting points on every product doesn't make any sense if u r sorting them by positions on your list.
Amazing Arun 🔥
Wow the world is going to change to better
Wow
Hi
uhm the plastic roads dont work, check thunderfoots vid
TAKE A CHILL PILLLL
I believe poo paper is from sri lanka. Mr.Thusitha.
He really is a tech god 👑
Here we go again 🚶🏿‍♂️ 🚶🏿‍♂️🚶🏿‍♂️🚶🏿‍♂️🚶🏿‍♂️
10:37🤩👍🏻
I just live for Arun's puns 😂😂
I can't with his *Jesus* shirt-
HM
I m waiting for the day where he runs out of ideas to rickroll us
i deal with mealworms feeding my lizard
Hi arun
The best video🎉🎉
hi
I remember having edible straws.
0:50 ... cloud storage, great pun
7:00
If you're an OG fan of Arun, and you HAVENT been rickrolled atleast 500 times while watching your videos, you're not real one
Speaking of Heavenly, have you believed in Jesus as your Lord and Savior? HIs death and resurrection restores my faith for humanity by saving us from our sins and giving us the gift of eternal life😄 What are you waiting for? Give your life to Him today and welcome to the Heavenly family🥰🥰
1472nd
17 minutes of HEAVENLY content
0:53 man that's the best scene 😳😂🔥
That shirt is too much....but in a weird way awesome... 🤣
JESUS STOP RICKROLLING ME
Thumbnail is proper click bait. But, the video is damn good too.
Now using living organism is Eco? I mean if we use plastic packaging we can reuse plastic and not to cut trees for paper. Mushroom is a way better idea than paper. But origin of plastic was not to cut too many trees
5:47  The middle class people  "I'm a water saver,i fill bucket and use it to take a bath" Insert khaby lame templates
microplastic
I love this setup lmao
11:22 ink-redible 🤭✅🥴
arun your channel is heavenly to us ❤️
helllllllllo.
Finished the vid! Cool
The main thing I take away from your videos is how much I have to learn about influencing my view on life. How to see things in a different light. You are a positive inspiration. Thank you
"So no one gonna talk about how he Rick rolled us ?"😂😂
Oooof he even bought that dress to film this ♥️.
I am in heaven right now. Great job mate. we gonna make sure you reach 15 million this year!
It's good that the world will fix itself in the future using technology, it's good that we have faith in it.
arun never fells to rickroll us
Bro congrats for 10mil soon
Make a studio tour 202w
Thanks you God, i thought Arun died since last 10 days 😂😂😂😂
you are legend dude👏👏👏
I like mrwhosetheboss because he spends so much effort on his videos
sus
That thumbnail though 😂😂 🤣
He really became Jesus for this video
Hi
I think that's the attire you wear in heaven 😉
Gotta love this video
he really did a 180 with the “worst tech” series
5:42 fun fact: it's from Philippines
How can Swedish new road not be in this. New road that charges cars when you drive on them :)
Arun has the best tech channel on YouTube, hands down! 💪🏻
I Guess It's Time For The New Set-Up Tour.... 😅
Imagine being allergic to mushrooms and you get that packaging and have an allergic reaction to it
Late
Arun is Jesus Confirmed.
yoooo early!!!
What you do for these videos,literally wore a weird robe on camera infront of thousands of people. amazing.
awesome bro
lests be honest we want aruns voice in siri and google assistant
POV: He tried to say 13:10 for 2 hours straight XD
quality
1cr sub loading💥
Plastic roads also shed microplastics into the environment which are then washed into everything... terrible idea
You can't save the world, especially if you included a xiaomi product on the list, look at how The CCP treat theirs own citizens and nature
I love how this video was recommended to me after a minute being uploadrr
HW no
Clothes made out of plastic is NOT  good!!!! It releases micro plastics!
Hi!
And even shocking that in our country there are actual Highway made from plastic
Someone who probably hacked your account replied with your account on my friends comment with a phone mumber and scammed him of almost 300 dollars, he should still have the screenshots, this was November last year

I wonder why he uses the number 21 in every Top invention and failure videos.
Vegan diet that is based on mostly soy, and avocados, are bad for the environment as the industry is reducing green belts (forests) and is affecting the water supply for most deprived communities in 3rd world.
1.2k comments after 10 minutes. Wow
9:18 the house from DragonBalls

Dunno how the youtube algorithm has not has not suggested you to me... Great content.. Subbed....
I'm sorry but all these vegan 'meat' products taste awful, not a single one is comparable to the real thing.
The bright idea pun in 9th invention........ I think you don't need to be sorry for that Edit: for 6th invention ink-redible pun, you need to be sorry.......      Just kidding.
