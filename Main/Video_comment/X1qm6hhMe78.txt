Rip PNB & V.Roy 🕊️
I wonder who people think Von is talking about when he said, "And yeah, yo lil baby mama look real good but that ..... pu$$y weak," It's weird how ppl overlook that he said that and thought he wanted her. He used her and didn't like what he got and lowkey lost his relationship and life over it.
Rip the Gang

“Fighting murder ones, couldn’t even see my son I was on the run, still throw the gun, we broke the bond now I got the biggest bag, You know these nigga mad   King con part
Dead Rappers 💯
I love pnb rock he was my fevo but why is this so setanic like even the lyrics describes his death like he knew he was gonna die. 1. there are candels in one of the scenes  2. There is a scene where he is looking at his watch 3. what is the door that he standing in front like is that the door to hell and why does he go in that door at the end of the song? 4. His brother could be seen in the car and disappear so that it is jus rock in the car at the end.  All I'm saying is this  video is so weird and for me it feels like a ritual video I just have the feeling that he was telling us that he is about to die. sorry for my English it is not my first language
Sad man
Still listening like it jus came out RIP VON and Rock❤️🕊️
Anyone here in 2024?
Rip von zell pnb
They are both goats even in 2024

RIP anyway though. Ik he grew up in an insane place though. Ik its hard to give excuses for murder. But ya ill shut up.

#LL PNB
There is ZERO “Resting in peace” RIP for the Wicked! Psalm 5:5. God only saves His children from judgement and those who continue in evil will see Gods judgement and wrath! Now PNB is awaiting Eternal judgement in his spiritual jail cell. It’s not a fun place to be as the Bible says. And only to await final judgement in the lake of fire! This life is no joke people! Get right with God! He is not playing! Judgement is at the door! Eternity is a long time just for some temporary pleasures! Turn to Christ Jesus now today while you still have air in your lungs and seek forgiveness from Him before it’s too late! There is no rest for the wicked
Man ts hit different now😔
REST IN POWER KINGS REST IN HEAVEN PNB & VON

Rip king von
King von is legend. His flow is different, next level goat. No one with a better flow. LLKV.
That scene with the whole oblock heads on fire was symbolic… if u take your time out during ur day god talks to u frequently the more you run away from him the less he talks the less u can hear walk towards god it’s easier said then done I kno especially when your whole crew lives by a code…. And u saying no to that lifestyle would put u n a bind with them….. but trust me nothing will happen to u the gang won’t love u no more and you won’t get that gang feeling but hey the gang didn’t love u anyway it takes bad situations for your gang members to show there true colors u don’t wanna wait till u get back doored or u go to jail n ur homie fuks ur girl n won’t help with lawyer money or you die and the promise y’all made to each other to take care of each other children if one of u go is out the window they figure he’s not here to see me not live up to our promise…. Only certain ppl in the gang get taken care of when shit hit the fan n if your 1 of them you kno u are …..if u have to wonder if your that guy most likely your not….none of the low level gang members ever get taken care of
Philly to Chicago 💯 🔴

I love how they all was posin like king von and shii tht was dope
So lets be honest here for a min How many Artist you know that would film à vidéo in O block without the actual feature Props he got balls
I love how they brought oblock officially in the video taking turns each on vons bars..I pray they dont have to go back to crime to survive...and if they had to catch a body..quando didnt shoot von ...lul tim prolly going to be called that timmy pack sooner or later!!
This song needs a desser or some EQ who ever mixed/mastered didn’t go a good job , the song on the other hand  🔥
it'll change me to do you think about touching me oh it will open this crazy and then make me crazy and I was in the cage in the murder one can you see my son I was on around fighting against a bullet gun now I got the biggest bag I didn't know these

He added muwop
Pnb rock it mee ur brother niece IM LONDONNNN IM ON MY GRANDMA PHONE! This is not fake.
Rip he couldnt see his son
This dope
Von  was  the  Goat for  real
Honestly, PnB deserves so much respect for the way he releases songs with artists who passed away. He was actually friends with them, which makes it a sad thing but I mean like, the songs released with deceased artists were songs of high quality and it didn't sound like some quick mixed bullshit
PnB went to the O for Von, he looking down smiling. RIP KING VON👊
Damn seeing this without von is crazy LlGrandSon💪🏿
Ina couple of years this songs is gonna age very well 💯🔥💯
yea yall see muwop and Bj in the cut
when he said “ popping all these perks i need to quit it, cop a brand new coup then leave the city” bro then the beat dropped that part got me turned
He got the o block chain 2

Is PNB Rock the devil cause after X made a song with him he passed away & after von made a song with him he passed. So is PNB cursed or the devil? Or just an unlucky guy?

Pnb Rock goin through it with X Pop smoke now von rest up 🕊
I spent a majority of my youth pretending to be someone I wasn’t. I wanted so desperately to be cool, to be noticed, to be liked..I didn’t like who was staring back at me in the MIRROR. I LIED to sound interesting, I LIED to appear funny, I LIED to get anyone to notice me. I wanted GIRLS to notice me...I was constantly chasing that relationship with ANYONE.. Since 2nd grade, constantly seeking the opposite sex. In 6th grade, I began to think about sex..alot I began to “self satisfy” any chance I got. Looking back at the habits I developed in that mindset...it makes me hang my head in shame. My Grandparents divorced, my parents divorced..it only made sense I was seeking that “intimacy”...any intimacy would do the job.. Habits I developed in my youth, overflowed and poured over into my Adulthood..almost cost me my marriage, my relationship with my children..it almost cost me my LIFE..  🩸🩸🩸🕊🕊🕊 I don’t write this, in search of pity.. I don’t share this, to tell you a story.. YOU ARE READING THIS RIGHT HERE AND NOW IN THIS MOMENT, because YOU made a choice, to watch this video and scroll through the comments, like you have always done.  But this time is different, because THIS is the moment someone brought you the good word 🙏🏽 That there is a God that sits on high, and he is waiting for you. He is waiting for you to lift up the past you’ve let drive your present, up to him! He is waiting for you to pull away from the habitual sin you have been living in! He is waiting for you to shout his name in praise on your darkest nights! He is waiting for you to stop asking the questions that don’t matter, and dig into his word! Waiting for you to take hold of the fact he sent his son to die the death that YOU AND I DESERVE!! Waiting for you to dig into his word for your redemption! The redemption that awaits the vessel developed in love, the vessel with the royal blood of heaven flowing through its veins!  This is for you!! The one who couldn’t stare in the mirror, the one who died!! This is for the one that HAS NO OTHER PLACE TO GO..BECAUSE THE LORD OUR GOD FOLLOWS US INTO THE DEEPEST PLACES, THE DARKEST PLACES, JUST TO TELL US HOW MUCH HE LOVES US, AND HAS PLANS TO PROSPER YOU AND TO NEVER HURT YOU!!  LOOK INTO THE MIRROR!! LOOK DEEP INTO YOUR OWN EYES!! PREACH TO YOURSELF!! TALK TO YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER AND ACCESS THE PATH THAT LEADS TO HIS GLORY, TO HIS WILL!!  Look into the mirror, acknowledging that you have FOUND GOD, and begin your WALK WITH GOD..by developing a relationship with his son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ 🕊🕊🕊  LOOK INTO THE MIRROR...  And start the habit of seeing YOURSELF, the way GOD SEES YOU..  Created in his image, beautifully made, for MEANING AND PURPOSE  🕊🕊🕊🩸🩸🩸  🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽Glory be to God!!🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽  If you have read this far, God bless you, if you have a few minutes listen to my NEW song “Mirror Image” on my page. Shut down everything else and join me as I  share many of the thoughts that I had with MYSELF, while looking into the mirror.. Join me as I talk to the man staring back at me, my MIRROR IMAGE 🕊🩸🙏🏽  https://youtu.be/hpFeh1l5YcA

Remind everyone about these things, and command them in God’s presence to stop fighting over words. Such arguments are useless, and they can ruin those who hear them  1 John 5:12-13 "He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life."  "For Christ died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring you to God. He was put to death in the body but made alive by the Spirit,"  John 14:6 "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me." (NKJV, NIV)  1 John 2:22-23 "Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son. Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also. (26) "These things I have written to you concerning those who try to deceive you." 1 John 2:22-23 "Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son. Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also. (26) "These things I have written to you concerning those who try to deceive you."
The marriage supper of the Lamb!!Proverbs 30:5-6 "Every word of God is flawless; he is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. Do not add to his words, or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar."
*YESSS AMENNNNN JESUS IS COMMING SOON!!! YOUR ALL BEING WARNED! GOD IS COMMING WITH HIS REWARD AND WRATH WITH HIM!!! THOSE WHO ARE IN SIN.. OR DONT BELIEVE IN GOD AND THAT JESUS DIED ON THE CROSS TO SAVE US FROM OUR SINS....ETC.......YALL WILL GO THROUGH IT WHEN HE COMES!! PLZ SEEK GOD FRRR N STOP THINKING ITS A JOKE OR FUNNY!!

This Right Here Different🧏🏾‍♂️🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro my iPad on 🔥 bro I love this song bro
Revolver hit him I ain’t solving that.     Fire bro🔥🔥🔥🔥
RIP GRANDSON
Well Damn🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 R.I.P.King Von🙏🏽💔
Welcome back this isn’t your first time here
I would have preferred his family to be in the video representing him instead of the clout chasers that didn't protect him
I remember this 🔥🔥🔥
Muwop: 😐
Múçh Løvé brø fw you for this 😇💯💯💯🤟
"2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. (Matthew 3:2 King James Bible)" It can't be much longer. After all we've seen and heard, the time must be near. Repent ye! For the kingdom of Heaven is at hand!
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

Because of the increasing rate that prophecy is being fulfilled, this world is quickly coming to a close. The great tribulation is about to begin, the worst time this world will ever know. God the Father wants to have a relationship with His creation. But everyone is born into sin and we need a way for us to be able to live eternally with the Father in heaven. Jesus made that way. Even though He is God, He left heaven and came to earth to be a sacrifice for a lost world. He never sinned. He was abandoned by His friends, was betrayed by Judas and handed over to be crucified. He was beaten so badly that He could not be recognized as a man. Then He willingly suffered an agonizing drawn out death on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised Him from the dead. And now He sits at the right hand of the Father and He is coming back any day now to Take home those who belong to Him. Just believe that He died for your sins.  You don't have to repent of sins. People who teach that, are wrong and they are not saved.  You don't have to give up drinking or drugs, etc. Just have faith that Jesus fully paid the price. After you are saved rest in Jesus' sacrifice. God will guide you and help you get rid of bad habits and to do good works according to His will. If you think you should do works, you're saying Jesus' sacrifice was not enough. Faith plus works will NOT save you. Once you believe that Jesus died for your sins, you will receive the Holy Spirit and you are sealed for eternity. Nothing you do or don't do can cause you to lose your salvation. Those who say that you can lose it are not saved. There is nothing we can do! It's all about what Jesus did! God gave us free will but He is a just God.  Rejecting salvation means an agonizing eternity in hell! In the great tribulation, the age of grace will be over and to be saved you must believe on Jesus plus resist taking the mark of the beast. Believe on Jesus now and you will escape having to go through the great tribulation!         I will try to answer if you have any questions.        For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16

This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Rapper with glasses can see your cap
Von gave pnb rock’s bumass career a much needed stimulus lmao

LLKV 🕊️
pnb was in oblock so much respect
How do I get to heaven? Will my good deeds be measured against my bad deeds? Do I need to be a good person to go to heaven? How do I know if I'm good enough?  Well the bible says no man is good, for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. So how do we get to heaven? Answer: By believing on Jesus Christ who took the punishment for our sin on the cross. There are no amount of good works we can do to achieve salvation because salvation is a free gift of God. We need to humble ourselves, realize we are sinners and that we need a savior.   John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave his only son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.
Von was gone bring the whole industry thru parkway 💯🙏🏽🐐

JESUS IS COMING  & HE LOVES YOU  Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin   THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!! JESUS is COMING BELIEVE AND AND ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR TRUST IN HIM TODAY GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH JUST COME BACK HOME AND LOVE HIM BACK  DENY YOURSELF DAILY AND TURN FROM SIN DAILY         #christian #jesus #faith #love #god #bible  #christ #church #christianity #fairtrade #gospel #hope #blessed #jesuschrist #truth #handmade #prayer #pray #scripture #life #holyspirit #worship #peace #godisgood #inspiration #religion #bibleverse #encouragement #motivation #good-news

Music is terrible nowadays
“Before I die u n*gas betta remember me foe being in these streets” that was tuff🔥
I'm not a fan of the"sound of hip hop" however this song Hits 🥰
Died a legend :(
Rip Von
You gotta replay von part everytime just can't hear it once
Please make no mistakes about it, the WICKED do NOT “RIP”. They stand before God Almighty and are ushered away into a holding cell of sorts and then have to wait for the FINAL JUDGEMENT where they are cast into the Eternal Lake of Fire 🔥. It’s sad to see how many people Satan has deceived, tricking them into believing you can live HOWEVER you want and then it’s all good when you die and that you’ll be “RIP”. Biggest lie in history  God is real, judgement is certain, and the wicked do not RIP  It’s best to get right with God Almighty before it’s too late! You’re not guaranteed another day. Bible says you MUST be born again to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. You must Repent and turn away from your wicked ways and turn to Christ in Faith for forgiveness and then must live for Him.
OTF when pnb come back he does cone back heard
Vons verse shot in Oblock w Gang, that was harrrrddddd💪🏾💪🏾 Rest up Von 🙏🏾

For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
Long love V. Roy🕊

People who actually make music or understand the formula for creating a hit knows this song is forever going to be a hit because we're all going to experience losing someone, this  joint is something special I love the way these young bulls give they stories up and make it appealing to the world. Von was now, not next, he was just starting to really talk into his own talents, he's what every young man wants to be out here both good and bad, except dead and shit, he took care of his while he was here, At least he didn't die with that testimony?!!!
We remember u von🥺🙏

I listened to that podcast and it sounds so much more impactful now. Crazy how death works. It’s not that ppl don’t give artist their flowers until they die, it’s because the story was just beginning and ended right when it started.  RIP King Von
The flow got more hype than the beat  Dude could go accapela and people would expect a beat drop
R.i.p King Von and shame on those people who attack him

Hate how pnb rock takes advantage of dead rappers and makes money off the dead.
Romans 10:9-10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

Rip von but Lowkey he ruined the song
Got the whole o block in that bitch heated
IMPORTANT MESSAGE  This life temporary. What matters is where you'll spend eternity. You'll either go to heaven or hell FOREVER. Being a “good” person and doing good deeds won’t get you into heaven. The only way to heaven is through Jesus Christ because through Him we have forgiveness of sins. Accept Jesus into your heart! God LOVES US SOOO MUCH and created us to be with Him. But our sin separates us from Him. So He sent His only son Jesus to be the perfect sacrifice for our sins. Jesus died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead so that we can have a relationship with God and eternal life.  If you believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose from the dead, surrender your life to Him today. He loves you so much. Talk to Him. Ask for forgiveness/ confess your sins to God and repent which means to turn away from your sins. Ask God to help you to turn away from your sins. Get a Bible, read it and obey it. Pray to God by talking to Him. Time is short. Jesus is coming back soon!!!   Pray something like this: "Jesus, I know that I am a sinner and that I cannot save myself. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of my sins. Help me to live my life for you. Jesus, come into my heart and be my Lord and Savior. Amen"   This link will help you more: https://www.gotquestions.org/questions_Christian.html

I love how all von boys split his part between them 💯❤️ like they are von💯❤️
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
Long live King Von
Long live King Von

Glad I can't understand his lyrics
r.i.p king von
Fun fact:    You're seeing this for a reason! God loves you so much that he sent his begotten son Jesus Christ to die on the cross to pay the full price of our sins. To be saved from dying in your iniquities you must call upon his name,confess him as Lord,believe God raised him from the dead,and repent.God bless y'all!❤️

The land is treating xx chromosome women like a white supremacy that EVERYTHING ELSE is being driven to serve.  If that ISN'T how an angel of the garden is supposed to be treated, then how are women getting away with it?  .  "That's Earth realizing women are living as God thru it."  Ok Earth, are you here to grow plants or husbands?  "Both."  Then wives caused the deserts by growing sex slave husbands, instead of growing plants or fully plant reclaiming something meaningful.  What makes a god give birth to a husband?  What qualifies women to be shitlord?  How did you EARN the right to tell other animals that they can't control their OWN REPRODUCTION?  Ps fuck you Earth you slimy oppressive peice of shit

Love this song 🎶
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🐐🐐 fire song and rip von
Rocking With This 💯🔥💯🔥

RIP VON! THIS TRACK is 🔥
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen!! Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out.

Jesus Christ loves you all so much. Come to him today! He's coming very soon! Accept him as your Lord and Savior. Jesus died on the cross 2021 years ago so that we may be free from our sins through him. Believe on him and Trust him! He is our peace in these troubling times. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

Jesus Christ will return very soon. Please put your faith in him, and what he did on the cross. We, as humans, live in a sinful nature. We are sinners, but the good news is that Jesus Christ sacrificed himself so that our sins could be forgiven. The Gospel is 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. Christ died for our sins, and on the third day, he rose from the dead, and ascended into heaven. Jesus loves and accepts everyone. It does not matter who you are or where you come from. He loves you, all you have to do is accept the GIFT that he provided for us. It's a gift that we do not earn ourselves. Not works, but through faith. Please get saved today.  Have a great day and remember that Jesus loves you; it does not matter who you are, he loves you. Maybe to help lift up someone else's day, you could spread this positive message around! Have a nice day!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥go crazy

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As74c5b5pHo
Almost four years ago I had an experience that truly changed my life. In February of 2017 I was deep into drugs and substances. I had an addiction to Methamphetamine and Synthetic Marijuana. One day I decided that I was going to use K2 and Methamphetamine simultaneously, and I did so. After I did this for about three days I began to become paranoid, but I wasn't to concerned about being paranoid because I knew that Methamphetamine made me paranoid in the past. But this time was different, after going several days without using the drug I still felt paranoid and it was gradually getting worse. During this time of torment, the four closest people in my life had found out something terrible that I hid deep in my past, and began to torment me about it, they would talk about it in such a way where only I could understand what they were talking about and there was nothing I could do about it other than to sit there and be scared about if I was going to make it through another day without being hurt by my own family, I was only 17 years old and I felt completely powerless.   At the time I did not believe in God, but I thought "If there is a God, He is the only one that can get me out of this mess." As the months went on I began to search after God with my whole heart, doing things I had never done like praying, studying the Bible and singing spiritual songs and lifting my hands in the air. And there came a day when I was listening to "Start Over" by NF and I said these words "Lord, look into my heart, you know that I want to do this more than anything else" and for the first time in my life God spoke to me, it was a very deep, loud voice and spoke like one having great authority and power and He said "I know Andrew"  Regardless of all the years of sin and everything that I did against God that broke His heart,  He still knew my name. I couldn't believe that God spoke to me, I was saying "HE KNOWS MY NAME HE KNOWS MY NAME, THE GOD OF THE UNIVERSE KNOWS WHO I AM" And that is when I realized I was not alone in that storm and that Jesus was going to deliver me and was going to use my failures to help other people who are stuck in the same place I was. He will reveal Himself to anybody who searches after Him, but the decision is up to you and the ball is in your court.

If you were given a free ticket to Paradise, would you go? Ask yourself, “Where is Paradise and what would you find there?” Beaches, palms, and surf? Mountains and snow-capped peaks? Is Paradise the unity of mankind and peace on earth? Paradise is actually the place where God dwells. Most people think they will go to Paradise when they die, but let’s see if that’s true. Have you ever lied or stolen? Liars and thieves won’t be in Paradise. Have you lusted after others, or dishonored your parents? Have you cursed the God who created Paradise? If any of these are true, you’ve offended Him and broken His Law. Instead of entering Paradise, the penalty for your crimes will be eternal death in Hell. However, God offers Paradise to those who bring Him a sinless payment for their sins. Your goodness and good deeds are not that sinless payment. God will only accept the sacrifice of His sinless Son, Jesus Christ. Anyone who repents and believes in Him will be cleansed of their sins and given that free ticket to Paradise! Jesus promised the thief on the cross who trusted in Him: “…Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.” (Luke 23:43) Don’t live in a “fool’s” Paradise thinking this life is all there is. God is inviting you to the “real” Paradise through faith in Jesus Christ. When you breathe your last breath and life on earth is over, will it be Paradise “lost” or Paradise “found” for you?
Miss Von bro, Philly love you 4 eternally,   EDITED: wished I have listened to Von b4 he died

Its Krazy How Many Songs PnB Made With Folks Who Not Even Here Nomore. Stay Safe
Njn
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.

The best career advice that I learned is don’t ever attach your-self to a PERSON, a place, a company, an organization or a project. Only Attach your-self to your mission in life and your PURPOSE. That’s how you keep your power and keep your peace!

XENOPHOBIA ZENITH   Exodus 1:6-12 The main mantra behind Brexit, refugee blocking, and boarder walls, is the idea that another nation, culture, or people, will take over the country. Don’t get me wrong; as politically incorrect as it sounds, being overrun by a different culture, ideal, and people; is not pleasant, no matter what those who advocate for immigration reform tell you. Still, this fear encapsulated in xenophobia has its roots in pride – the fear that we will be replaced, marginalized, no longer exist the way we expect and are familiar with. Since JESUS made and loves us all we must embrace everyone in love.
Some Illuminati shii right der

🔥🔥🔥🔥
The  ABCs of Salvation, or how to be right with God, and know you're going to Heaven:  A-dmit that you're a sinner, and need a Savior.  As it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one. Romans 3:10  For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23  B-elieve that Jesus Christ died paying the penalty for your sins, and rose from the grave.  He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross. 1 Peter 2:24  For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures... 1 Corinthians 15:3-4  C-all on the Lord Jesus Christ to save you, and trust only in Him for your salvation.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9  For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10:13  The moment you "believe," or, put your trust in what Jesus has done for you, God saves you and your eternal destiny in Heaven is assured. You go from spiritual death to eternal life the moment you believe.  Jesus said it this way: Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life. John 5:24😀

Real niggas been had this song...oh yeh free lul tim and ****... ***
I like the song but von does not neeed to be on this
IMPORTANT MESSAGE  This life temporary. What matters is where you'll spend eternity. You'll either go to heaven or hell FOREVER. Being a “good” person and doing good deeds won’t get you into heaven. The only way to heaven is through Jesus Christ because through Him we have forgiveness of sins. Accept Jesus into your heart! God LOVES US SOOO MUCH and created us to be with Him. But our sin separates us from Him. So He sent His only son Jesus to be the perfect sacrifice for our sins. Jesus died for our sins on the cross and rose from the dead so that we can have a relationship with God and eternal life.  If you believe that Jesus died for your sins and rose from the grave, surrender your life to Him today. He loves you so much. Talk to Him. Ask for forgiveness/ confess your sins to God and repent which means to turn away from your sins. Ask God to help you to turn away from your sins. Get a Bible, read it and obey it. Pray to God by talking to Him. Time is short. Jesus is coming back soon!!!   Pray something like this: "Jesus, I know that I am a sinner and that I cannot save myself. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of my sins. Help me to live my life for you. Jesus, come into my heart and be my Lord and Savior. Amen"   Romans 6:23

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)¿

https://youtu.be/Q9R.-yXXXwC8 Wisdom Follow Jesus Christ, he rose from the dead! Obey him before its too late. He is the only way to get to the Father John 14:6 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Hebrews 5:9 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 2:38 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord: Hebrews 12:14 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy. Proverbs 28:13

I mean it’s cool that he put von homies in the video but I think he shoulda took when von was rapping the snippet on the million dollar game interview and just threw it on there. Von literally rapped his whole verse. It woulda gave it a more genuine vibe. #RIPKingVon

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Song bout his dead homies. Von passes. Crazy
I know this might sound redundant and you've probably seen these types of comments everywhere BUT as an Independent artist with no connections sometimes you have to resort to those type of methods. I go by the name of JMtheMelomane and I work and pay my bills just like you (most likely lol). GOD gifted me with this musical skill and my goal is to make music as a living. In order to do that I release music every 2 weeks on my PAYDAYS to hopefully gain some organic traction  and make music a full-time thing. I'm leaving this comment in the hope that this will pique your attention to  give my music a listen. Who knows,  maybe you'll find my hustle inspiring and something you can relate to ;) Thank you SO much if you've read all that and decided to give it a try. If not I still wish you a great day and good luck in your life! MUSIC IS SOUL!
💔
Song a hit
