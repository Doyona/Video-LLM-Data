Never sell my soul  So what do u want  A cookie??
This one a little better but none of this is fucking w 2019 jackboy
Jackboy so underrated. He been hard since way back. A lot of respect to him, he held it down when nobody else would.
I have no clue why this was recommended to me, I hate hiphop and rap. YouTube algorithm be like that I guess. The reason I’m bothering to comment though is because these comments look fake af. Seriously, they all look generated by bots. I dunno if they’re actually fake or not, but there’s just something really off about them and it’s weird. There’s like, way too much positivity for a YouTube comment section. All of them are like “Jackboy is awesome!” I mean… Come on.
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😈😈
This shit hard imagine a travis scott feature on the this.
I’d punch my son straight if I caught him listening this this shit.

Real boss change for the better  I respect jboy
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Jesus is real and he is coming very soon, follow him while he may be found. Repent'_
This shit is trash and kodak should fire you as his cousin
boy u 2 hard always knew u was gone pop. u him.
Seek Jesus Christ so you do not lose your soul in hell once you die. Live Holy and respect God.

How the fuck u didn't say that hook more ...that hook fire ...u could had people saying it around the world but it want repetitive enough
"niggas brag on what they did, so I never ask a bitch for help" that line and the title alone speaks volumes tbh. Shoutout to Jack for having his head on straight and not going off the deep end with the drugs and glamour the game has to offer.

Jesus is Lord and Savior!🙏🏽 come to him before it's too late.  Jesus said, “Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy to bear, and the burden I give you is light.” Matthew 11:28‭-‬30 NLT
