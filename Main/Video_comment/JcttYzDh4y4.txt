Is it weird that I came to your channel from your collab with ClickforTaz when you was around 600k last year and I had no idea who the sidemen were 🤣
9TH ON TRENDING BROO
10.03 that's y she ate
How do you know which ones to use and where they are, you always have dirrerent cameras for sertain shoots. Do you ever loose cameras/mics?
1:26 i thought he lost 1 arm💀😂
This is higher on the trending videos than the actual video is
9:45 was that part filmed with an actual old camera? Like 90s or 80s camera?
I wanted to know how the camera woman changed boats halfway through the video 😭.
So close to 1 mill
Early congrats on 1m dude!
I also have a frontpack.  Mine just can’t store anything in it
Hey Kon how the hell your girlfriend switched boats mid-sea mid video? Drones??😂😂
9:53 how is there a hat floating on a hoodie behind kirstie 😂😂😂
I was wondering why there was a camera man wearing a bike helmet 😂
KSI holding back his excitement for you almost hitting a mill 😂
Keep up the good work! Love these behind the scenes videos.

"I can't wait to be surrounded by seamen"

I wish the member of the sidemen vlog was this smooth
Kon has BEST behind the scenes videos
7:29 my man had coffee and still slept on the video
GET KON TO 1 MIL SUBS
anyone feels kon using sdmn sunday "behind the scene" to make his content from another channel for his benefits, isnt that like leeching off their channel or something?                now kon for 1 million subs cut 1 strand of ksi's  hair and make a video of you selling it
Kon to 1 million cmon guys hit subscribe!!!
i love these, donjt know how others dont...

just realised that the crew is basically the sidemen sidemen.
I read it as bangers lol 3:20
You should get fired.. missed many great shots in that video
4:48 broooo twins alert
So let me tell you an impressing thing Jj : Ok I almost hit 1 milion sub Jj :oh really Jj mind : i have 23 milion hhahaAHAHHAHAHAHA!!!!!
Josh shoulda got Logan Paul’s reaction to Tommy T
3:55 — Lol is that what you're doing Kon🤣? Typically that's such a mad thing to say to your girlfriend publicly in front of everyone even as a joke, but hey... 🤷🏾‍♂️ I guess it runs with you lot so good for you
“You technically ate many little humans last night” We just gonna let that slide?
9:42-10:00 is the best shots ngl it brings retro vibes
Do Sidemen tinder with Logan mate
Just here for the camera banter between the boys 😏
Thank you.
12 to go!!
Kon to a mil 🙌
the production level is absolutely insane!
These videos are awesome, really shines the light on some of the guys behind the Sidemen channel
Yo Kon, how was Kirsty on both boats? In the beginning of the Sidemen Sunday video she's on your boat and towards the end she's on the other boat 🤔
Read it as Bang hoes and was like hold up.....
I've never thought of wearing a front and backpack , shit that's a good idea
When the sidemen video comes out. After the video ALWAYS CHECK CON!!!!!
hi
7:44 Bruh that got me weak🤣🤣
3:55 ahhh is that because of the 2:21
Ahh mate the old school filter!! Takes me back
Its cool to see the Camera Crew POV from Sidemen Sunday's. It's really dope big up Kon!!
3:55 Kon is a Savage lads.
Kon only has subs cause he uses the sidemen
I actually enjoyed this more than the actual sidemen Sunday
Bang hoes?
12k left for the 1 milly 👌
Ive always seen that camerawoman in sidemen couple of times and i think we've never seen her upclose untill now lol.
what kind of kids did she eat kon 😏😏
lol the guy is wearing an ikea hat lmao
Paris you aint supposed to be in new york
Ngl am I stupid or at 5;53 s he called his sponsper squarface
He actually looked like such a donut in the video wearing a bike helmet hahaha
They should do sidemen tinder but In America with logan
PLEASE DO MORE BTS!!!!!
12k away come on
This man has the best job in the world
0:36 😂😂😂
everyone not knowing logan coming was hilarious
Lmao jj is drinking chai at 7:35 , universal drink ✊
I think sidemen camera crew can make another youtube channel called cameramen 🤣🤣
3:54 that is a violation by Mr Kon
Can u do tutorial for photo shooting and editing like josh photo
You technically ate many little humans last night   I AM DEAED
I love when JJ or anyone else just don't give a shit about some random things Kon says. On a serious note now, why this man doesn't have 1 million subs by now? What's keeping some of you from clicking the subscribe button?
Sheeessssh mah g
What do you think about Nomatic bags?
remember when sidemen told kon that if he hit 1 mil he wont upload another bts🤣🤣🤣
Why does jake look like kimbo slice
The shot between 9:45 and 10:00 looks so good
this was more entertainment than the original video in the SIDEMEN channel.  it's so much fun watching these kind of videos, keep it up. congrats on 1m subs :)
Bangros kon is the real g
3:58 Kon 😉
Almost 1 mil kon !!! Adv Congrats on 1 mil🥰
How did your gf move from one boat to the other.  OR does she have a twin??
JJ: "anything that has KSI in it just does well" The KSI Show says otherwise
You're a 🐐 kon!
That was a really good throw by Logan
You technically ate many little humans last night"  im dead
I'm deadass confused on why he was wearing a bike helmet 0:00 😂😂
Sideman made both their editor and camera man famous 😂😂
mans said ate little humans last night wth
1:14 I thought my man was missing an arm
Ayyyy
I thought about this when I was watching the full video but how did Kirsty teleport from one boat to the other? 😅
Kon, Whats better for filming in your opinion? like canon for filming and sony for photos?
Well we all know kirstys a swallower cheers kon 😂😂😂
What camera do you use on your head ?
Love them old gen style clips kon 👌👌
8:07 jj unimpressed and left
3:52😂😂😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️
3:57 Kon is just a savage
Now I understand when JJ says there are two black guys in the boat,  He was talking about the cameramen, not Vick
I love how much kon and Kirsty don’t care what they say 😂
lit ep.
Hey Kon recently I’ve been getting into videography and find the parts of your bts videos really interesting where you are choosing your kit and explain their purpose, do you mind leaning into that a bit more? I feel that that would be so entertaining seeing you in the storage place choosing your kit and why you are, just a suggestion:)
Kon should have been a major part of the ksi show-- > like if you agree
Your vids are such vibes
3:55 shagger Kon
I have one question… how did Kirsty and Kon constantly change which boat they were on in the video?
Watching Logan and Kon together and then u remember the diss track video he made on Logan which was insane 😂😂
Getting close to 1 mill now :)!
so close to a mil now lad keep it up you r got an amazing attitude
JJ: “anything that has KSI in it does well” That didn’t age well…
I'm just saying me being from Belfast and being a car enthusiast it brings joy to me that Louie (sorry If I spelt Louie wrong) is wearing a DMC t-shirt
Looking forward to you getting 1 mill !!! 🥳
LET'S GOO
Kirsty looking like 10 year old me when I used to go camping in the park and I thought I was Bear Grylls 😃😃
Yo thats mad 03:55
Kon is the magic to the sidemen videos
3:56 outrageous
7:44 - New Kon short. "Me and Ksi aren't friends anymore"
I think it would've been more entertaining if JJ and Logan were on the same boat
Love this😂, God bless ✝️❤️
It's nice to see Logan with them even though I didn't really like him. Also I didn't expect to love it more
Sleepy Jake Paul 3-1 gotta love his hidden hair line.
Well 3:54 taught me a lot about how open Kon is about his relationship ahaha
They should do one more sidemen tinder with logan and his mates.
The best thing about this video was founding out why he had that bike helmet on 😂
7:58 jj acting is so funny
10:10 didn’t know gib would be in this video
Are you releasing Sidemen BTS before Sidemen Sunday? 😂
3:59  Well then :D
That’s great banter
Kon too 1 milly
Lol I didn't realize tommy T is out fishing
3:00 learned from Helmet Boi himself 👳🏾‍♂️
Why does Logan’s pet think he’s so funny
He had a coffee and still fell asleep 😂😂😂
3:55 Kon, that is a MADNESS
l
Haha konnnn man this is JOKES
Ummm no cap I dont wanna see the dude with the Bike Helmet on ever again... Thought he was joking when he put it on at the start but he had it on the whole time :/ WTF is the helmet going to do? Does he wear a mask inside his own house too?
10:16 callux
kon is quick to secure the bag💰😂
So Matt Hancock is also Gordon Ramsay hmmm
My Sidemen Sunday experience isn't complete without watching Kon's behind the scenes video.  And this Sidemen Sunday was an absolute banger 🔥🔥🙏
100th babyyyyy
Whats that filming/editing style for the shots at 9:45-10:00ish? that done with a camera or in post?
The tense fox ignificantly stain because rocket formally join a a ritzy hill. entertaining,  flagrant cicada
How is kon  getting more brand deals than sidemen while filming the behind the scenes 😂😂😂 let's go kon.
i always wait till kons comes out and then after this i watch the sidemens vid
Oiii 9:45 what camera or filter are you using i need to know
No way, they just broke the Internet 🥶
Absolutely loved this and the sidemen video you should 100% do another collab with Logan respect to you all x

What was with the marks and smudges on the camera?
Nice😁
Kon u the legend mate
How much kids did she eat Kon

Big W from Team KSI
"You technically ate many little humans last night"  Thats outrageous😂

Came here straight after the sidemen's video, behind the scenes is where it's at!
Without Kon, the sidemen's videos wouldn't be the same

Outer banks vibes

Without kon sidemen will be not having some banging quality
Now this was the collab we were waiting for
