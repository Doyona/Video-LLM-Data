I always thought Lady Danbury was voicing Lady Whistledown. I didn't realize it was Julie Andrews.
After 3 years, I just realised that the plot was Taming of the Shrew
This Season is my fav one
Season 2 is by far the best season
I watched season 1 just to watch this season 2. Oh it was worth it. Both Kate and Anthony are phenomenal!
So Nostalgic❤
I can not get over it 😍 I just love season 2
Dark Collins was... a really bad idea.
Easily the best Bridgerton content ever!
The actor portrayed kate is worst..literally i hate the show bcz of her..utterly waste 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Vomiting
This season is so boring
I hate Penelope
Fake Review Chakkar Se Main Faltu Mein Dekhliya,S1 Totally time wasting concept, boring & uninteresting story. 👎
Season 1 is way much better.
Please do Cinderella
I didn't like Kate or Simon
WHERE IS SIMON ???????????????
This show sucks now. I only watched it for that fine Duke
Waiting for season 3 😢..when would we be able to watch that one...
The narrator should 100% get paid to read the books
Season 1 was better for  me, had better chemistry! So many  of Antony and Kate's scenes  was cringey,  a little  bit too much...gosh,  especially  the bee sting scene 😳
BRIDGERTON SEASON 3 🤌🤌👉👈 pleasssssssssesseeeeeeee, it is the only thing I have been looking forward to this whole year. Do something. 📺🪞❤️‍🔥💐
Straight Out Of Bridgerton
What's the name of the music pls??
Repulsive, unpleasant, disgusting, disastrous, zoophilic, product of a twisted and really racist mind, and based on the series "The Planet of the Apes".  England black queen?  Black royalty? White maids and no black ones? DISRESPECTFUL to the real history.  Like Disney, they destroying values by imposing the "Black Lives Matter" movement.  Season 1 was acceptable, but season 2 is annoying, a selfish sister destroying young sister love and ilutions, being a sly bitch, by controlling and manipulating her life.
Blacks sure do love being white folks sloppy seconds. When do we get a multiracial cast of the great African kingdoms?
Bridgerton s3?
Where is India...is she not going to be in season 2?
When is Bridgerton season three
season 3 is taking so long🥺
tak gempak ah trailer
I’m no racist but the Indian characters are just not visually exciting as Rege Jean Page. Couldn’t they have picked better looking actors?  It was easier to dismiss the racial inaccuracies in Season  1 with the Duke’s smoldering looks but  I just lost my appetite to watch the second season, more so that they wiped out the Duke’s character.
How about changing the thumbnail to Kate or Anthony, idk, the season's actual leads?
awesome!
I watched Season 2 so many times; It was so good 😭
Best season ❤❤❤
Love Anthony and Kate❤️
Beautiful 😍
Anthony and Kate <3 patiently waiting for Season 3
It is undeniably good and better than season 1 but I love them both but KANTHONY is on another Levellll❤
WHEN IS SEASON 3 COMING
I’ve read comments that season 2 was way better than season 1 and I didn’t believe it at first. But I just finished season 2 and it was absolutely the best no doubt. I mean Simon and Daphne was awesome as well, but all I thought of was that they are a hot and sexy couple and it has given us way too many sex scenes than necessary. Whereas Kate and Anthony, I can truly see the passion they have for each other that I didn’t see in season 1. The way they film the secret glances of the two, the way they look at each other, it was so intense than any characters I’ve seen. Huge applaud for the two actors, an amazing job!!!
I had no idea there were so many peoples of the colors in England in those days.
Appreciate series manage to entertain and carry interest of audience,  however,  I am quite surprised to see , even now , British don't understand Indian culture,  Sharma is surname from North India who are equally fair in complexion whereas, makers still love to Portay Indian as Dark skin ( no I am not racists, we Indian have diversity in appearance,  traditions rituals etc, , but maker of the show , could have done little research on diversity of India for their character "Sharma" to make show more realistic) ....
Why I am shipping Benedict and Edwina even when they didn't share a scene together and its hinted that she may marry the prince. 😅
Simone can't act but she had a good chemistry with Jhonny for some reason, maybe because it was Jhonny who was carrying the show this season. Anthony was marvellous this season, acting wise.
Bridgerton is a woke person's La La Land. Everything shown in Season 1 & 2 are highly inaccurate. Showing diversity of "race" in the times when there wasn't any, by making an African as lead hero in season 1. Africans may have been in England at those times as well, but don't think they would have had the privilege to marry a white girl. In season 2 keeping the surnames of the anglo indian girls as "Sharma" shows that Shonda Rhimes has no clue about Indian Culture. Sharma community, the upper caste people have always followed Hinduism not Christianity.
Second season is not as good as season one 😢
I JUST REWATCHED FOR LIKE 7TH TIME, I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL SEASON 3
Can anyone tell me the name of the song used in this trailer?
Excited for season 3.
I really really looooove this Season!   I think Season two was better than one! Anthony Bridgerton and Kate Sharma have such a great and strong chemistry!!! They did a very good job! Can't wait for Season 3.
In season 2 I couldn't find Simon and bridegerton...help me
Can anyone tell me the name of the song?
The books were great, The miniseries is not! The only good thing in Season 2 is Anthony’s phenomenal acting! He was simply amazing. Great acting, outstanding dialogue delivery, and superb portrayal of the character he was chosen for. He should receive every accolade possible. I hope he walks away with all kinds of acting laurels. Lady Danbury and Benedict are also very well done indeed. That said, the rest of the cast and this production is below average. Its as if the screenwriters sat around a table and decided to use quotes and lines from all 8 of the Bridgerton books to put season 2 together, alongwith dialogues spoken by Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice - i won’t say exactly which specific lines and scenes were  plagiarized - i think discerning readers and followers of productions portraying those historical periods will know what i refer to! Plagiarism is among the worst ethical /academic crimes and it is shameful that Netflix, Shondaland
Is season 2 already out or what ?
what's the song's name in this? Can't really find it in the soundtracks
Where's duke
Such shows are designed to revise and erase the historical horrors of British Colonialism and to continue propagating the Victorian British Fantasy world. Indians romancing white guys in Colonial Britain..Yeah right. non white people were sub human in colonial Britain. This becomes all the more egregious because the British monarchy still has not said sorry for Colonialism unlike the Germans have for the holocaust. Also the British dont teach their colonial past in schools..
wait it only been a month since the trailer? i just finished it an hour ago, took me 2 days. I can’t wait for more Bridgerton mischief.
I've always known it was Penelope at the beginning hahaha because she was holding a book at episode 1.
Dearest reader, I recently reviewed The Viscount Who Loved Me.. check it out before you binge this season!!!
Netflix could do how they built the modiste and where the bought all the sewing supplies and organisers
This is the best thing ever created thank you so much 💗🥰
Sorry. I was hooked from the get-go on Season One. Season Two was a snoozefest for me.it's not the actors, it's the scripts. So little happens that I ended up focused on the exaggerated character 'tics'. As ever, I enjoy watching Lady Danbury and Queen Charlotte, but I find myself wanting to smack Eloise for her obnoxiousness. She's not a clever trapped woman, she's a pain. Zero empathy for her. Same for Anthony. I disliked the misogynistic obstructionist then, and I still dislike him, although not because I am a fan of Kate - yet another willfully blind obstructionist. Alas, no one here to root for. No one I have sympathy with. Even the dialogue for Pen fell flat for me. So many capable attractive actors, costumes and sets all in search of a compelling plot. Sigh. I know reasonable people may disagree, but I was thoroughly disappointed. Oh, well.
It's up or no
I love Penelope in the books. She's an independent woman who earned her own fortune and supported her family in secret after the death of her father. I was disappointed when she character-assassinated the pregnant lady(who was never in the books). That's not the kind of person she is at all, at least in the books. I can't believe they made her out to be like this, to be honest. I hope there is some redemption or consequence for this. Though I doubt there is.
wouhouuuu exiting
TOMORROW! Can you believe it's only one day away? It seemed like we've had to wait forever...
March 25th is not coming fast enough! I’m so excited.
FINALLY
Okay is that Sofi Bekett with Benedict? So early? No way!!! I am hooked!!!!!
OK if i have must watch season 2, it would be lovely, if the line has story of penelope and colin , besides eloise's crush 🥂🥂
black english queen with black nobles in their court. How Netflix of Netflix to do that
crap
I love this couple in the book ❤️ the chemistry
I'm looking forward to seeing this all the same, but isn't this a very similar story to the first?
What is the song under the voices?
The trailer gave me goosebumps. I can't imagine what the series will do.
So annoyed they gave LW away so early in the piece.... but for sure looking forward to this installment.. never liked the first book or the first series....
Omg I’m so excited! Can’t wait
Egearly waiting for this season of Brighton
Never understood why people found that duke in season one so attractive… I find the two brothers (oldest and middle one) of Daphne soooo hot 🥵
Idk, but no offense i found her sister more soothing for kate sharma .
The enemies to lovers trope is going to be so entertaining.
Darn!  I simply can’t wait!  Thank you Netflix
im so excited
Assistindo de novo só porque hoje sai o TREILER
It better be good like the first season
The amount of times I've watched this trailers 😫 is unhealthy
WHERE IS THE TRAILER?
TUDOOOOO
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
OMG
vem aiiiiiiiiiiii
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
H,j
Which couple is that in 0:44 sex scene ?
👏🏻 WHERE 👏🏻 IS 👏🏻 THE 👏🏻 DUKE!
Ouuu sauceyy
When is the trailer coming?
Ugh got to wait 20 more daysss
maybe the worst show I've ever seen
SO EXCITED SO EXCITED SO EXCITED SO EXCITED
I’m about to go rewatch season 1 bc I miss Bridgeton so much
I just hope that since this is an intricate series that takes time and attention to detail, that none of the characters are replaced with different actors overtime 😭 I could see them using different actors for Hyacinth and the little ones, but not Elouise, Penelope, Collin, or any of the other older prominent characters
Bridgerton, Stranger Things, The Carrie Diaries, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, The Wedding Singer with Madonna's Material Girl in the soundtrack
Seriously Penelope ❤🥺🥺
And Netflix upped their monthly price and so I won't be able to watch this...thanks Netflix, you just keep screwing up, the only good thing about you are your shows
Bc Netflix dose horror
Is this horror?
I'm sorry but season 2 without Regé is a NO!! how are we able to see the happy family of Daphne Simon and their child like whut we are all waiting for S2 to see a glimpse of their love with their child 😭
I haven't been THIS excited since December, when Spiderman came out😂😂
I cannot waiiitttt!😩🙌🏼❤❤
Finally!!!! I read all the books! I’m so glad I’m finally seeing another show season (and not a movie!) from books that I throughly enjoyed!
I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE PENELOPE IS MS. WISTLETOWN!!!!!!!
bridgerton is literally a ball, nothing else going on in their world
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Who's acting instead of Simon? I already miss him
MY BODY IS READY
Finally! We've been waiting for over a year.
Ew
What a perfect birthday gift ☺️
not verry realistic whit all that blackwashing of history .
Where my G’raha Tia fans at????
Can’t wait to watch 😊
OH. MY. GOD. It's. HERE.
whose Bridgerton's will the main character for season 2? Anthony?
Segunda temporada cadê ? 😡😡😡😡
AHHHHHH I NEED THIS NOWWWW😭🤚😭
I literally cannot wait 😭😭
I was worried bcs i didn't wanted the main couple to break off or have too many difficulties (bcs tha is what shows are made of) so it makes me so excited to see ppl saying each book changes the focus of the main couple bcs it is really interesting this way
Is this season more about Anthony?  He’s so hottttt
Gente, que legal!Amei essa série!❤️
SHARPEN THOSE KNIVES GIRL
Benedict and Sophie, let's go!
At last
Where are Simon and Daphne? 😢
OmG...
Btw, I need to admit that whoever is responsible for the marketing is a genius. They're dropping trailers and teasers every 2-3 months, so the moment the hype of a trailer is gone and I forget Bridgerton for a while, the next one comes and we're going crazy again... So frustrating... and yet admirable.
SO STOKED. Who’s kissing in the buff at 00:45?!
I hope they keep historical romances coming after the Bridgerton series.
I'll watch this just because of the bridgerton brothers cuz i have a hella crush on them
sorry anthony and kate, but now benedict and eloise scene at 0:38 takes all  of my attention
I can’t wait 😝
Yaaassss
Where is the trailer? 😩😩😩😩
Peeeen omg i just finished the first season and I've seen this trailer before i finish it so i was kinda spoiled but it still surprises me i thought this trailer is just to lure my mind but omg
Uruguay 🇺🇾 presente y ansiosa por el comienzo 😍🥳🤩😁🥰😋🧐💯
Okay okay okay, is the scene at 00:39 with the brothers fencing.  THAT SCENE from book three where they talk about Colin and Penelope??? Because if it is!!!! 👀 GIIIIIIRRRRLLLL I'm going to have to prepare myself!!! It also makes sense!  Colin and Pens relationship is Childhood Friends to Lovers! And I need those "years of Colin being abroad," before some sense knocking him over!   I also hope we get Benedicts Masquerade scene with Sophie and WHERE IS FRANCESCA!!!! I need to see her with John!
A teaser,...or a spoiler?!!!
She's about to cut with that quill and words. :)
Although i have forgotten their names but i am also looking forward.
Omg!! Been waiting for thisss!!!
omggg can't wait <3
Looking forward to this but I get scared to get too attached to Netflix originals because they have so many just dropped shows even when they are good. Dark Crystal for one. Its an insult to viewers to have so many shows that they just don't finish, at least finish them. Prime, hbo , paramount are spitting content out left and RIGHT. How many more years till Stranger things, Frankie and Grace, the deep,  Last Kingdom finally coming out. Maybe if each season actually ends, not with a cliff hanger, it won't be so offensive when it doesn't return. Just a thought.
When is it dropping?
can't waittt
Next up: ben and sophie 😉
YESSSSS LETS GO!!!! 🦢 🎩 🏰
Kate of color!? Yes bitch!
I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BE MARCH 25 ALREADY!!
I NEED MORE BRIDGERTON S2 CONTENTS 😭😭😭😭
Yikes, this fat lady is the new highlight? Not watching.
Finally, my fav story, can't wait to see them.
Since season 1 i find Anthony bridgerton more handsome and sexier than simon. Who else feel the same?
Penelope Featherington is the greatest character played by the greatest actress and I want everyone to know she is why we watch!
Woahh
I wish Netflix would do one on Lisa Klypas' novel series The Ravenel's and The Wallflower series!
is it just me waiting to see whether the 'bee scene' - book readers will know - is gunna happen? like how what howw?? kanthony for the win! 100% the best book :) but francesca's is hard to miss too..
I literally hate penelope so much
😍😍😍
Дурость!!! Себя изображайте!!!
El día de mi cumpleaños?? Esto es real??
Ich hoffe von Herzen..das noch viele Staffeln kommen werden !!! NETFLIX ..BITTE nicht einfach absetzten! Die guten Serie sind kurz und die Grotten schlechten ohne Stil und Gehirn zieht ihr….ACH… versucht mal zwischen den Staffeln nicht immer sooooooooooooo eine lange Zeit dazwischen zu setzen….das ist nicht Kundenservice orientiert. Ich danke für die Aufmerksamkeit
I'm actually sobbing I'm so excited
UGH I NEED IT NOW
Now I have something to look forward to!!
“Did you miss me?” Your ‘Gossip Girl’ is showing.
OMG! I can't wait to watch this.
What about Fate: The Winx Saga and Ginny and Georgia, when is their second season releasing?
The mixing of Penelope’s voice and Julie Andrews has literally just given me chills 😩🤌🏻
♥️…finally a date 🌹
WHEN I TELL U I AM SCREAMING
25th march is my birthday 😌
1800 gossip girl is back
I literally squealed, im so excited for this
More more half nude Rege Jean Page to drool over so I’m only half excited for this….
Man, Royal Ascot is way better now.
Can’t wait!!!!
ㅅㅂ
I don't like that Simon and Daphne aren't the protagonist anymore. I don't really care about his brother life
I cant believe simon not in s2 😭
Omg 😆 can’t wait
OMG cant wait to watch this 🥰🥰🥰🥰
can't wait for this to begin
no wayy i dont believe its Penelope
omfg..
I see you, Hampton Court Palace. 💕
I already watched season one three times. Counting days til season2. Can't wait
Hopefully, they fix Penelope's friggen bust line!!!!
Don’t be shy, release the series early
I LOVE THIS SERIES OMG
The bridgerton main lead may changes, but still Penelope is my favourite
I still think the biggest mistake they made was revealing who Lady Whistledown was. I LOVE her, the character, the voice of our beloved Julie Andrews, and especially Nicola Coughlan as Penelope. It would have been better to keep that part a secret. Big mistake. But as long as Nicola is featured in the new season, I'll watch. Though I'll dearly miss The Duke.
Been waiting for this🤗🤗🤗
2 words: Shonda Rhimes ♥️♥️
I’m going to miss the Duke
a desi lead!!! i'm turned in
Hah i recently know this
YYAASS!! I CAN'T WAIT. THE DRAMA THAT IS GOING TO  HAPPEN.
Aaaa cant wait
I wonder what will they do with Sophie. Make her Japanese?
Cant wait
Can't wait, Can't wait
I hate that Simon is not coming back :(
Ya cayó el Antonio
The Original Wattpad Girl TM
I miss Simon ❤️
Gossip Girl meets Pride & Prejudice
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16)✝️
sad we probably won't be seeing any Simon this season but I'm sure it'll still be a great watch
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA que belleza
Woke
ok but is anyone else wanna watch the season over again to see the connection between Lady whistledown and Penelope
I was really looking forward to this season
Penelope, the Best story 💕
god yes im so excited to see penelope
This may come as a surprise to some people but historical dramas are not required to be historically accurate. I think Bridgerton does a great job of portraying an alternate historical era.
Dare I say Anthony actually looks…attractive this season?  I honestly paid him no attention last season. Thank Jesus those awfully hideous sideburns are gone.  Now he’s shirtless in a bathtub. I am so ready for this season.
Очередная провальная картина с черной знатью, которой не было в реале.
Although I didn’t watch the series, I love knowing whats happening. I love the diversity of each lead couple in each series. So far, Simon is black, Kate is Indian … now do we have hope that there will be a Asian and Hispanic lead coming in? Keeping my finger cross.
I cant wait
Can't wait for March 25!!!!!!!
As the first season was not enough bs...
I actually thought that Lady Whistledown was Lady Danbury since her voice seemed to me so similar to Lady Whistledown's voice. So at the end of the season I only assumed that Penelope was helping Danbury. This trailer have just made me realize that Penelope actually IS Lady Whistledown. I feel so dumb 😭
Where is Simon!😭😭😭
¡Que poquito queda ya para verla!
No entendí un caraj°
I have read anthony, benedict, eloise, and hyacinth's books so far. Though i'm not going to read daphne's bcs i already watched the 1st season, also gregory because the reviews i've seen said it's bad. So that leaves me with francesca and colin, both who i already know will end up with who lol
SE VIENE PENELOPE SIIIIII
Penelope ❤️
AAAAAAAAAH I CAN'T WAITTTT
Everyone in this show looks beautiful
I thought it would be an old lady speaking not the ginger lady
Gossip girl
Aww im so ecxiated can't wait for new season🎉🤩🤩
Can’t wait
I cant tell if penelope is accomplished or psychopath. Because its amazing shes earning a fortune in a mans mans world. But that creepy smiley face. Psychopath.
Shonda Rhimes ❤
IM SK EXCITED
Basically, Bridgerton is Gossip Girl Regency Era - London.
I'm waiting for this at last
kinda like the Gossip Girl of old centuries 👗
Penny was the character I was most invested in (yes, I do love 'Derry Girls') so I was immensely pleased with the Lady Wistledown reveal!
Watched solely to confirm the presence of the corgi.
Nice to know that redhead b*tch faces no consequences from last season 😅
Kate OMG IM SO EXCITED
This season gonna EAT
Ok it looks good and promising BUT what about Simon ?!?! 😭😭 he's the main character u can't just never bring him back like never 😭
YAYYY
Is it really that girl or is it a trickeryyyy?
someone tell me the name of this violin song
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 OMG this looks sooo good !!
Ughh gosh Anthony got even hotter!!! I can’t wait!!!!!❤️❤️❤️
Can wait
March 25??? Sounds like years!!!!😩
I wish they had saved the Lady Whistledown reveal until the end of season 3 instead of 1. It keeps the mystery and suspense going like Gossip Girl or Pretty Little Liars.
Will this be as hot as season 1?
FINALLY
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS!!!!!
I cant breath ..!!! I cant wait ,Penelope looks soo beautiful
About to be an eventful march with both Bridgerton and Stranger Things coming out a few days apart. Definitely not complaining thoughhh🤩
Bridgerton and derry girls? I LOVE THAT FOR HER
Finally
Hey everyone Jesus loves you
do i need to watch season 1 fro this?
can anyone tell me if you enjoyed the books? id love to read them but im not sure!
NOOOOOOO! THIS IS BRAINCELL-NULL content.
اعملنا فيلم عن حياة المتحولين الجمال دراميا وعينهم في مناصب رئاسيه هل لايستحقون؟ ده احنا دفنينه سوا وانت تعلم اني لا اهرج
Yeeessss🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why did they give this a season two?
That Palace is in rrr
ya era horaaaaa 💖😩
I’m ready for a full trailer please!!
Слишком много черных
It's giving me Pride and Prejudice vibes so much but I don't care...I am in love with Kanthony!!
Ohhhh FCKKKKKK I can't wait to watch it but I have my Examzz UGH!
Blackwashing
Can't wait for Penelope's season!
Please make Messiah Season 2
I love Bridgerton and I’m so excited for season 2
The whole show is absolutly unrealistic and just...bad ! But yeah, that's just my opinion, y'all have fun watching it <3
So excited for this! This season should have the masquerade ball where Benedict meets Sophie.
This is not historically accurate. They enslaved African people and now they are trying to erase the truth!
What abt Daphne's love story?
Yeeess
Wow was waiting for season 2 ✨❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
VISCOUNT ME IN BABY
I miss y’all
Yeeessss
You know what would have really sucked for a woman back then? To have some kind of hidden illness, like epilepsy. I'd like to see a story line from this time period where a guy falls madly in love with a woman and even though she really needs to marry she won't have anything to do with him, and you can't figure out why. Finally it comes out that she's epileptic and knows that she'll just drag him down and be a burden on him.
i'm not a book lover, but after i watched bridgerton s1, i'm getting more curious about the other bridgerton series, so i began to read the series, gosh can't wait to see it in live actions :"D
Cant wait
al fin un teaser decente de netflix donde no te cuentan toda la historia
ME COMÍ EL SPOILER DE QUE ES LA GORDITA AYUDA
EMOCIÓN
Anthony🙈
Who is this fat mess? lol
omgggg I can't waitttt  😃
Wtf is this woke sh**?
Yes!!!!!!!!
Gossip Girl but with paper and candles ♡
Where is Simon,?
why cant netflix just change the date mane  cant wait that long
Ahh can’t wait!!
Eloise is going to be pissed if she figures out Penelope is Lady Whistledown.
I see the Bridgertons have a thing for chocolate lmao
Tomara que venha logo com dublagem. Português
I hope they will release every season ASAP. Huhuhu. Waiting for 2 years took a lot of patience and the characters were getting older
I know they made it quite obvious in the end of season one that Penelope featherington is lady whistledown.. But am i the only one who thinks perhaps  Penelope is a part of a bigger team and they're all working anonymously together under one name???? 🤔
NEWTON!!! I’m SO GLAD YOU’LL BE THERE!
Black princess WTF 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
🤍🤍🤍
Oh Baby!!!!
Omggg yasss my fav serial ever has a S2 coming up!!!
I really shouldn’t have watched this before finishing the first season lol
To Live, or Not to Live, That Is the Question  “To be, or not to be, that is the question,” mused Prince Hamlet in the so-called “nunnery scene” of William Shakespeare’s play Hamlet. Every year, around the world, some 800,000 people answer this question negatively and take their own lives. Even worse, suicide is one of the leading causes of death among young people. Why do people, especially young ones, take their own lives? Is it possible to strengthen their desire to live?  The authors of the Talmud wrote, “For two and a half years, the House of Shammai and the House of Hillel disputed. One side said, ‘It is better for man not to be born than to be born,’ and the other side said, ‘It is better for man to be born than not to be born.’ They concluded, ‘It is better for man not to be born than to be born, but now that he is born, let him look into his actions’” (Eruvin 13b). Indeed, if an alien were to land on Earth and look at us, it would probably say, “The pathetic humans bump into each other, ridicule and humiliate one another, and do everything they can to ruin each other’s lives. No wonder they are so depressed. Why did nature create such miserable beings?”  Suicide is the extreme consequence of a series of problems that afflict people to the point where they decide to end it all. But even before these problems become too much to handle, they make us ask about the meaning of life. After all, if life is only about survival through ordeals, then it is indeed better not to be born than to be born.  The thing is that when we begin to ask questions about life, or as the sages wrote, “look into our actions,” we begin to grow. Pain leads to spiritual development that lifts us to realms we would not have dreamed existed, and we would not have searched for them were we not forced by pain.  The key to these new realms lies in fostering positive connections among people, in emerging from the mindset of alienation and narcissism we have so devoutly nurtured until now, to find that when we sympathize with others, we gain rather than lose. We win new perspectives and new ideas, new wisdom and knowledge, and new friends. By changing our attitude to others, we change our world.  Moreover, by choosing who we bond with, we shape and reshape our world with every new acquaintance. In this way, no world is too harsh to live in, since we can always change the people we connect to, and in so doing, change our world. Also, there is no end to the insights and knowledge we can gain since there are always more connections to make than we can establish in our lifetime.  And best of all, when we connect with other people, we attune ourselves to our surrounding reality, which is already connected and would have worked in perfect harmony if we, humans, did not disrupt it. The more we develop positive connections, which aim to support and nurture rather than depress and oppress one another, the more we expand our perception of reality. We find that the reality we have known until now was only a “corridor” to a deeper and more expansive perception.  If we want people not to take their own lives, we must give them a reason to live. When people understand what life is for, they will have a purpose to go through life’s trials and tribulations. As Nietzsche wrote, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”  Therefore, our task today is to reshape our connections in order to reshape our world. The world reflects our attitude toward others. If we jointly transform our attitude toward others from abusive and aggressive to considerate and caring, the lives of all of us will change, as well, from a losing battle to a smooth and pleasant ride. It is really up to us.
Im excited for Eloise's storyline
Amazing series the purity of untouched love
THEY WAY I SCREAMED INTERNALLY WHEN I SAW THIS
I will miss Simon basett
Can't wait for this. This is my favourite among all the books.
LESGOOOOO
LESGOOOOO
No wayy.. It's Penelope?
I knew it from the beggining pen was lw she was the only one who reads and wants to go to college.🧡
the way i just finished reading penelope and colin’s story and you don’t how stoked i was hearing penelope as lady whistledown
Encore une fois, l' histoire qui est écrite dans les livres et l'histoire dans la série n'ont rien à voir, déjà  dans Virgin River c'est de l'à peu près et là  ben ça recommence et je peux vous dire que je préfère et de loin l'histoire dans les livres que dans la série, décidément Nexflix c'est du grand n'importe quoi ! Je ne pense pas regarder la suite de la série cette fois ci .
Me a sucker for enemies to lovers !! Ughh yess
I’m soooo exited
It's time to binge watch season 1 for the 100th time 👀
Can't wait any longer
Really excited for s2💃
I can't wait
Omg!!!!! 🥳🥳
Wow! Lady whistledown got prettier...😁😁😁
Season 1 has impact, so the casts comeback in season 2 will be awesome
I still don’t get how she’s lady whatever if their not suppose to know anything about sex
I cannot wait 😍
🙄🙄🙄
Yay, can’t wait.
I can just see a transgender main character coming to Season 3.
Will Wakanda feature Asians and Whites in the next movie?
Omg omg omggg! So excited!!!
I’m confused. So if Penelope is lady whistledown then wouldn’t that mean that her family is still very much wealthy?
Omggg i can't waittt
Yess i can't wait 😆😆😆
I see Daphne 😍😍
Only if simon was there in the second season😭😭😭😭
I thought this would be shit but loved it. Can't wait 🙂
AH MEUUUUU!!! TÔ TÃO ANSIOSA PRA ESSA TEMPORADA E DAQUI A POUCO ESTÁ PRÓXIMO DA TEMPORADA DA PENELOPE E O COLIN AHHHHH MEU CASAL TÔ TÃO ANSIOSA
This is not nearly as exciting as the first one.
SEASON 2 FINALLY
Is season 2 not about Simon and Daphne,because i don't like that,i loved first season just about love betwen Simon and Daphne
Oh damn! Just release season 2 already. We have been waiting from we watched the last episode of season 1. Hurry....Sigh
Waiting patiently 🤗
I’m still upset about no Regé-Jean Page 😭.
I love the Regency Era version of tailgating at the beginning.
I can’t wait I can’t wait I can’t wait!!!!!!
God yessssssss!!!
cant waitttt
I’m still sad Simon don’t be in this season
Not historically accurate…but still decent,
Eh...trailer is definitely underwhelming but I'll be watching nonetheless...I really enjoyed last season
OMG 😭😭😭
Historical romance novel is such a niche genre, i wonder if there would be another series that get adaptation even with the success of bridgerton
Looking forward to see how it will play out without the duke.
I guess Hwasa will get excited and promoting this again for people to watch😊
miscegenation
Epic!
IM SO EXITED MAN
The history inaccuracies are so horrid in this series… I can’t, it is too much  😞
This book was the best in the series, looking forward for the new drama.
Is that one of the girls from sex education?
Knowing Shonda...I had a feeling the brother's love interest was going to be a black woman. His constant attraction to women who weren't "society friendly" gave it away.
im so so so excited
Simply cannot wait 🤓
I waited for a year but since the guy who plays the husband is not in im not watching it
AHHHHHHH I CANNOT WAIT 🙏🙏
Finnaly season 2 is coming
Did they recast lady whistledown? Tone sounds a bit different.
Bravo to Simone Ashley from Sex Education.
Ahhhh I’m sooooo excited to see the second season!!!!!
I saw Daphne!! I’m so happy to see her in this season
ομγ
Yassss! Can't wait
This teaser is so satisfying to watch, I can't stop myself from replaying it over and over again! We need the FULL TRAILER PLEASE 😭💞
QUEEN
I'M HERE FOR ITTTTTT!!!!😍😍
Yeayyy❤️❤️❤️
IVE WATCHED THIS TRAILER SOO MANY TIMES!!! I’M SOO EXCITED🥳🥳🥳🙌🏾
I’m sooooooo excited !!!
March 25..  yayyy on my birthday
Save yourself the ordeal of watching a second season of this cr*p. Readers of the books are betrayed, lovers of Victorian period series are disgusted, and supporters of good British dramas are laughing.
The Season is going to be hard to beat the first story. Can’t say this clip has got me as buzzing the same , but looking forward to Anthony’s story all the same .
Waiting so badly
When Julie Andrews and Penelope's voices mixed, I had a panic attack
Bridgerton is BACK... don't miss... it's like Jane Austen and Agatha Christie enjoying a pot of GUMBO.... super good!!! 😍🤩
מתי זה יוצא?😍😍😍😍
When is it going to start?
All of Trinidad and Tobago cannot wait
Can we have a separate series with Rege-Jean Page character? Please and thank you.
Is it ok to watch season 2, without watching season 1?
Ohhh myyyyyyy
Aaahhh I'm too excited for this🥺🥺🥺‼️‼️‼️
Ooh I’m so excited
I wonder why they used an old woman's voice for lady whistledon wen we all know she isn't old
Yayyy🤸
I can’t wait for a season about Hyacinth!
I am so excited for this!
now drop derry girls for more nicola coughlan
Wait what!? A season 2?? I wasn't really aware about this!
Nicola girl! Derry Girls and this?! Love that for you!
How come I don't see that handsome guy 😒
I knew it
Anthony!!! 😍
If you want to be entertained,  i recommend you to read the Viscount who loved me 🥰 You will know the Bridgerton family deeper and Kate’s personality
But Simon and Daphne 😢😢?
I hope it's not going to be just around Penelope... It's not her story... yet
Jesus Christ loves you 🥺
I CAN'T WAITTTTT
Omg! I can’t wait 😁
GAY FOR PHOEBE DYNEVOR OMYGADDDDD
Ааааааа😍😍😍😍
🎀Can’t wait! 🙌🎀
YAAAAAASSS
I just can’t watch it without the duke and ditches 😭😭 it won’t be same
yes yes yes!!!!
Okay I will watch it, but I am still thoroughly disappointed that the duke wont be there
I'm So excited !!!!!!!!!
OWEYMGE
AAAACK
Are we getting a DVD release of season one before this premieres or what?
I do wish it seemed closer to the book, but otherwise it doesn't look half bad. I do hope Offer From a Gentleman is a bit less gimmicky, less 'we live in the same universe as Brandy Cinderella now' (not that that's a bad thing, I love that movie!), and more classic and toned down. More Austen less Witcher, if that makes sense. Also I hope they get a damn good actress for Sophie and choose her based solely on her talents.
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell. XOXO gossip girl
When Julie Andrews and Penelope's voices mixed, I had a panic attack
"Did you miss me?" OH YES, I DID
I guess I gotta rewatch S1. I don't remember the characters very well lmao
Já está disponível na Netflix?? Quero me esbaldar.
aaaa akhirnyaaa, kangen benedict wkwkwk
AM I SCREAMING??? ARE YOU SCREAMING??? ARE WE ALL SCREAMING??????
I cant wait!!!
Что за сериал?😯
YEHSIS YES ITS BACK IM SO HAPPY ABDOWBS
aaaa demi apa yg di tunggu tunggu
WHERE IS MY SIMON ??!!!
I am so excited!!!! I can't wait for Anthony and Kates story. Kate is one of my favourites in the series.
OMGGGGGGGGGG FINALLYY YASHHHH
Corgi!!!!
Waiting! Looks promising
It's going to be the longest month! I can't wait!!! 😍😍😍😍
Anthony!!!!
The fact that they don’t show Simon fully scares me. If he dies - or worse, CHEATS ON DAPHNE - it’s on sight.
Cant wait!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Does anyone know the music for this trailer? It's driving me crazy, I feel like I've heard it before!
YES LETS GOOOOO
Uh can’t wait
IM SO EXCITTEDD DOH MY GODDD IM GONNA PEE MYSELFLG
O just want more of last season! The Duke!!♡♡♡♡
Nothing like the books- total disgrace if you are a true fan of historical romance
Is it just me but do you think that the woman Benedict was with is Sophie? or maybe not? Oh man I have to wait a lot until we see Eloise's romance
THIS IS WHAT I'M WAITING FOR
I’ve watched S1 in 1 day and I don’t think I’ve ever been this excited for a S2 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️ Plus I looove Anthony
Ooooooo yes!!!
Hoy gagii
This is all I've been waiting for since December 2019. It's my favorite book from the series 😍😍😍
I LOVE this show! I binged watched it in one day. ❤️
Meh, i likes the first couple. I'm not as much into the New one
I'm confused.  Isn't this supposed to be around the regency era? Didn't knew that black people were that privileged back in 1880 England
cuando se estrena??
I am mainly watching this series because of the wardrobe and the accent. I love series/movies of this kind/era.
AAAAA I CANNOT POSSIBLY BE EXPECTED TO WAIT SUCH A LONG TIME FOR THE SECOND SEASON TO COME OUT
WHERE IS MY HUSBAND THE DUKE??
NO DUKE OF HASTINGS?!?! meh.
Seeing Indian actresses in these beautiful dresses in and one of my favorite tropes makes my heart flutter because I rarely get to see Indian women like me do these things
Ngl this looks like it would just be season one again. Which isn’t bad, but if you didn’t like the first you probably won’t like the second.
Can't wait!
I don’t wanna wait until March😭😭
Season two can’t get here fast enough!!!
Can't wait for the premiere!
I cannot wait!!
I hope they made the Pall Mall game
Puke puke puke puke.🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
BITCHES!!!! I’m SOOO READY!!!
I just can understand what anyone sees in this dreadful series...and the costumes look fantasy....
<3
I was 12 when I watched the first season and the love scenes definitely traumatised me. May watch season 2 still though 😂
Netflix fans if you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, hated, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Please think about your eternal life, believe and repent, Love Y'all
I'm sooo stoked for this!
Yay! Excited 😍😍😍
YESSS!!!! So excited!!!! ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Netflix I want "Cinderella" 2 please 😭😭😭😭 I know I sound stupid but still😫
Bridgerton:>>>>Euphoria
I’m just happy for the return of Eloise 😂
Bro just air the show already
oh yes
this girl is from the harry potter movie!
I can’t wait for Penelope’s love story by far my favorite book! ❤️
I can’t wait until they tell the story of Penelope
Yessss we are back baby!!!
Can't wait 😁
I've been waiting for this, and I've already started to wait for the next season
I can't wait for Penelope and Collins season. Their book was my absolute fav
I wouldn't call it a global sensation
Brazil hereee 🐝♥️🇧🇷
So excited… cannot wait
Ah the corgi!!!
Penelope😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I HATE that Penelope is lady whistle down. Literally doesn’t make sense at all
what’s the song ???
This season is about to be so good I read the book and omlll I’m in loveee
where is Simon though?
🥺❤️
My favorite part is the corgi  being in the trailer🥰😍
Sooo ummm can season 3 bring back the tall dark n handsome back cus I only watched it bc of him and tht shorty he was messing wit lol but bet
aw Alex Meyers got another one to make new video on💅
THIS is what i've been waiting for
Yes definitely a global sensation
Perfeeeeeito!!! nas mãos de outros produtores que não a Shoudaland eu duvido que tamanha perfeição seria alcançada. Infartando aqui só com o teaser 💜💜🐝🐝
So this means  3 period drama's (Bridgeton, Sandton and Gentlemen Jack) are premiering in march😍😍😍  In the mean time I'm enjoying the gilded age. Leave a comment down below if there are any other period drama series or movie that i/we should check out👇
PENELOPE TE AMO
Can’t wait
Every time I see Penelope I'm always hoping for Season 4 ...her book with her own Bridgeton Man.
Oh my god!!!! I CANT WAIT!!!
HELLO??? I JUST FINISH WATCHING IT
Kate and Anthonyyyyyyy💜💜💜💜💜😭😭😭😭😭 cant wait for themnmmmm✨✨✨
can't wait
omggg i can't wait for this season, but im gonna miss duke 😔💘
dark skinned south asian rep in mainstream media??? we LOVEEE to see it!!!
There are no black royals in history. This series doesn’t make any sense.
So I see a lot of theories on why they revealed Penelope’s identity so early on and honestly think it was because they knew that if they didn't a lot of people would just find out by either reading the books or looking it up online or somehow get it spoiled.
Finally!!!!!
OMFG YES
Kate and Anthony is the game changer!! The best enemies to lover🐝🔥
Dukr nerde lannn
Ahh!
OMG i am so excited for march🤯🤯🤯
Nicola is the cutest person on earth
The costumes and set designs?????? Oh so lush, I love it! (I was squealing the entire time).
I'm a sucker for this!!! ✨✨✨✨✨✨
Omegat omegat omegatttttttt this is happening
I CAN’T FCKIN WAIIITTT 🥳
Excitement! Excitement! Excitement!
I can't wait. I just finished book 4 and reading book 5 but still I will watch the exciting drama suspense of Bridgerton. Book 2 was my favorite please make them explode the audience mind
If you love woke propaganda, then this is for you!
Can't wait😍😍
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
So excited.
Netflix prepone the release date!
0:44 okay i’ll be watching!
I always wondered how Penelope makes the newspaper behind the back of the whole world?
Once upon a time,  I was in an African country called Kenya. I was but fresh out of highschool. The only books I consumed were historical regency romance novels. I found the first bridgerton book sold by this guy who sold book on the streets, around him were hawkers selling vegetables and he was there selling books and he had a deal, and You could bring your own book and get to choose whichever novel you wanted for only 50 cents . That's 50ksb. I was there 2012 digging around for books and found 'An offer from a gentleman'. I consumed this book in a heartbeat. Benedict is it for me guys. So when I took it to my grandmother to read (RIP), she had loooved it. She died and someone in my family has the book, I will find it one day. Anyway the next time I found the next bridgerton book was a year later in the Upperhill library. This one was, (it's in His kiss). Hyacinths story. And the internet came. I went into the internet and pirated all the bridgerton books. I am now living in NY. I bought the books but People. This was me going around Nairobi at 20 yrs old. I couldn't decide what to do with my life, still don't but I was going around Nairobi reading every historical romance with all the smut I could find. I had no shame, lmao. The guy knew what books he was selling and his loyal customer always came for the one with all the smut. He even pointed out the ones for me. So, when I read Shonda Rhimes was taking up the bridgerton series, at 27 yrs old. I nearly had a heart attack.  So my anticipation and expectations for this series is very high up
No duke not watching it
This is the crappiest show ever. Terrible acting, laughable dialogue, forced "chemistry" based on nothing but good looks, repulsive, graphic, constant sex scenes where lust is supposed to represent love. This is Jane Austen for the low-IQ plebs who binge on "Real Housewives".
I'm DYING to watch this!!
👏👏🔥🔥💥💥🚀🚀
Gosh at first I thought it was a bad idea to reveal Pen so early but now I'm so hype omggggg ❤️❤️❤️
Welp Rege is the reason I watched the first season, so I guess I’ll be reading about it instead.
This makes me want to reread the books.
I’m so excited
OMGG
Finally
OMG i cant wait!!!!
Reverse of last season....
This gave me NOTHING
I CAN’T WAIT!!
Oh my god I can’t wait
Netflix you better fix my account so i get to watch season two of the great bridgerton pls its saying not  playing in this location
Watching this PURELY for more Jonathan Bailey!!!!! 😍😍😍
Looking forward to this!!
Lord have mercy cancel this show
Ah looks so interesting!
Already missing Anthony's sideburns :(
I Love the ending when Penelope's & Julie's Voice come together.  "I've been Sharpening my Knives FOR ALL OF YOU" ✒  The Phrase, "The Pen is Mightier than the Sword" is true through the entire Bridgerton Books. I Highly Suggest Reading the Series in addition to Watching the  Great Netflix Series.
0:44 What's going on? Who kissing who?
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
can't wait. this is probably my favorite book in the series. i just love a good enemies to lovers novels. just hope it'll be as good
Hate this dumb show. Cringe.
This teaser, such a tease indeed. Can’t wait!!!
I cannot wait for this!
Eu não vejo a hora de assistir ansiosa ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh Kate, my dearest, fiercest Kate
Who is the voice?
je les aiment ce couplé est merveilleux les autres ne viennent  pas à leurs chevilles  rege est magnifique et daphné sublime  après  rideU
Counting down the minutes ⏳
I can’t wait for Penelope’s story ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Omg yes.
It looks great 👍 but I am gonna miss Daphne and Simon together 🥺💔
AAA I’m so excited
So excited
I need a series similier to this
We need the duke
Now that we know that Penelope is Lady Whistledown, I wonder how much this will affect her friendship with Eloise
Still gonna miss the Duke though. he was too good of eye candy.
Did the duchess catch her husband chiting?!
I thought Katherine Langford gained weight and played a role like Insatiable
Ouuu I can't wait
YES!❤️❤️❤️ Thank you!
Who, WHO is at 0:44/0:45!??
I wish netflix would start picking up webcomics and novels to make kdramas or shows. There's so many stories like bridgerton and is actually trendy, most plots are about a girl from modern world who one day woke up as a princess inside a book and they have to avoid their death and the tragic ending like suddenly became a princess which is my favorite webtoon and Novel and is the most well known one.
Ohmygod Sso excitednpls
ME GUSTÓ MUCHO Y solo son segundos
unfollow you till march 25th
I don't think they are following the book in this one too :(
Make sure this season 2 is good . . . .
I really thought the drama for the audience was “ who is lady wistledown” but now I see it’s literally about the siblings and she’s the narrator. That was a fun twist ending for season 1. I’m curious what will be the “ mystery “ this season
I can’t wait for that 😍😍
First of all… yassss to all the black girl magic I see.!! Penelope definitely deserves love this season, I hope to see that. And where’s the new baby!??
Babe! Prepare the tea. We're going to war.
I can’t wait 🔥
OMG 😭😭 SOO EXCITED
Vem logo
Ansiosa meu Deus
Lady Marites is coming.
omg bridgerton on my birthday I am blessed 😭🙏
I'm sooooooo excited for the bee scene. 😂.
hope it continues to do well so we can finally get to colin and pennys story
Clare Devlin, is that you?
No netflix we are not watching this anymore if the prince is not there. Goodbye 👋
Ohh finally! ❤️
I've been watching Nicola's interview videos for the past few days. She's with short blonde hair in these. And when I see her in the trailer now, my brain was like WHAT HAPPENED TO HER HAIR?! for a moment (≧▽≦) I think I'm obsessed with her blonde hair
I’m freaking outtt
YES
Does anyone know the song?
this is not enemies to lovers, this is rivals to lovers, i am begging y’all to please learn the damn difference
Love everything, but why are you fuc*ing up my favourite character - Penelope? She looks so evil and in the books is so different... i still will watch it the moment it comes out tho hahahah
hay dữ ta, cuốn vì giọng Anh
this show....is a masterpiece. one of the best shows of all time
ARGHHHHHH I AM SOOOO EXITED😍😍😍😍
So looking forward to this Season!
OMFG YESS IVE BEEN DYING FOR THIS

THE BLOODY CHEMISTRY WITH THE SNIPPETS I CANNOT 😭😭😭
I just got whole bunch of gooseebumpsss
What a load of shite..black people weren't members of the ruling classes
I haven’t read the books, but I’ve read somewhere that the reveal that Penelope was Lady W came later on. I’m so bitter that they revealed it so early, I loved Penelope in the first season but knowing now how she befriends people to them write her stories it’s just... you know not very nice
lady Whistleton 🤝 gossipgirl
Aaahhhhh!!!!
Imma binge watch Season 2 till my eyes pop out 😂
Just finished season 1 cant wait for 2🔥🔥
I am questioning why the Featheringtons have gone to subtle shades? Whatever happened there??
Wow.... it's coming on my birthday...me is so excited

ELOISE IS SO PRETTY OH MY GOD I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER
omg i am so excited ♡!
Bring KATHONY on!!! Seriously, I need to see more Antony and Kate in promotion, I’m desperate already 😭😭😭
YES MARCH 25 COME NOW
The Queen's reaction is exactly my reaction when I see this trailer.
Pleaaase have trixie and katya react
The "did You miss me" sounded like uf it las the trailer of gossipgirl
I'm so excited to watch this
i don't know how they're gonna do it without rege jean page
She's back. 😈
First season was amazing 😍😍 I hope this season is also as good 🤗🤗
Wowie
Characters that looks inspired from Pride and Prejudice:- Anthony- Mr Darcy Kate- Lizzie Bennett Daphne-Jane Bennett Mrs Featherington- Mrs Bennett Simon- Mr.Bingley
Damit I'm so excited
This is the sort of shit that really butters my eggroll
Omgggggggggggggg
OH MY GOD! OHH MY GOD!! OH MY HOLY FRIGGIN' GOODNESS GOD! JUT RELEASE IT ALREADY. I AM DYING HERE OF ANTICIPATION. GOD KNOWS I AM BURNING FOR A NEW SEASON, IF THAT MAKES SENSE!
My heart!!!
Can’t wait
“Did you miss me?” gave so much gossip girl vibes…I LOVE IT
Im freaking exciteeedddd
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHH FINALLY👏👏
Will miss Rege
i want Penelope and Colin to get together
If you guys want an amazing show to watch similar to bridgerton and possibly even better- watch outlander!!! let me tell u it’s SPICY
so hypedd! literally my favourite series .. and i cant wait to see the new female lead in action
I love period dramas and yet this show is so uninteresting to me lol feels way too fake and unrealistic
ENEMIES TO LOVERS LETS GOOOOOOOO
Can't waittt
Meu coração não aguenta de tanto esperar😻
Give Penelope all the love in the world❤️
This looks lit
Making my new wardrobe now.
OH MY GOD YASSSS! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW!
YES KATE COME THRUU She and Pen are my fave fmc in the series
The sexual tension between Anthony and Kate ! I am ready
can’t wait ❤️
🐝🐝🥰
Can't wait for the newest season although I'm probably the only one who finds Penelope super annoying.
people who haven't read the books should be expecting to like this more than season 1 I reckon, the storylines defo improve from book 1/season 1
can't believe they revealed pen as whistledown already, the way it all played out in book 4 was good, and essential to that storyline...
reminds me of gossip girl haha
PENÉLOPE EU TE AMO
Let’s gooooo already!
Can't wait!!!
I just know its not going to be as good because Regé Jean isn’t in it anymore! Why!?!?😭😭
Cant believe jean paul is not in there
Venha kate encantar o mundo!!!!
I can’t wait 😍
انتظر بفارق الصبر🐝❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Can’t wait to see it. Love this series. Genius writing! How ever I would make it a bit more saucy. ❤️👏
Listen!!!!!!!!
Omg
Hold on so Simon really not coming back 😱
Cant wait the 2nd season  comes out on my birthday
Love it, really, great teaser, BUT we need more Kate and Anthony in the trailer! This is the Kathony season! Pretty please!
IM SO  EXCITED
I have to reread the book now!
This season is going to be so different from season 1. Even the setting is going to change. Most of the scenes will be filmed at Aubrey Hall and that's very secluded away from the watching eyes of the ton. I'm so excited for what's going to happen and the bees and tulips and Newton and Pall Mall ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
why are there black peoples dressed in kings and queens clothing? especially for that period
i lowkey wish they hadn’t let the audience know it was penelope and kept it secret like in gossip girl. but i’m also curious how they’ll keep her being “anonymous” still interesting and suspenseful with all of us already knowing the identity
cant wait
I loved season 1... can't wait 😍
I can't wait
Can you please make some funko pops??? 😍😍
💓💓💓 Λατρεία💓💓💓💓
So is Penelope Lady Whistledown?
Not gonna lie, I wasn’t too excited about season 2, but after reading the books I CANT WAIT FOR ANTHONY!!!
Looking forward to the bee scene!!!. I hope they wouldn’t change much from the original plot in the book. All the scenes are lovely
Ugh! can't wait!!!! LEt's gooooooooooooooooooo
I AM SCREAMING RIGHT NOW! It’s going show it in my birthday month❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I burn for this trailer🤣🤣😉
Missing the duke!! Last season trailer was much more captivating!! 😍
AAAAAAAH
I got goosebumps watching this 😍🥰
Goosebumps!!! I can't wait 😊😊😊🥰🥰🥰
I CANT WAIT
Minha impressão é que Kate está muito mais bonita que a irmã, o quê não condiz com a história e o enredo.   A atriz que escolheram para ser Kate é perfeita. Já para Edwina, esperava mais.   Ahhhh, minha personagem preferida de todos os livros é Lady Danbuy , Adjoa Andoh simplesmente encarna o papel com tanta perfeição que acredito ser ela mesma.
Ahhh
So damn excited !
Did you miss me:  yess, very very much
AHHH CANNOT CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT.
D dogs look was literally the cutest 😇
Let’s Go 🗣🗣 Love it 😍 i💕💕
Hey @Netflix! If you want it to make it extra exiting, so that people speak about it frequently at work, in school, wherever... Release the episodes week by week. Talking about what is happening now, sharing actual suspicions etc. by having a fun topic to talk about, is a social benefit for people, that you should not underestimate. Especially for a big show like that one 😉❤   If you release everything at once, that opportunity will not appear. In fact the only thing that people actually can talk about during watching the show are spoilers. The only good thing about that is, that inpacient People can watch the show during one day. But the same inpatient people will suffer more, since they'll have to wait much longer till they'll see the next season.   Another benefit of splitting the show week by week: if you split the release one episode by one, week by week, more people are going to continue their Netflix membership for longer than one test month and that means its probably more profitable for you.   Think about it. One of the things that makes us enjoy a show more than just watching it, is to talk with friends about it on a regular basis 😉👍  Greetings from Europe
WHHHAAATTTT😯😯😳excited!!! But gonna miss Duke 🥲
OMH
so basically romanticised gossip girl
Finally!!!
Omg I can't wait for this season, can't wait for Newton and Antony 😂💚  But seriously though I'm a sucker for enemies to lover trope~
TÁ CHEGANDOOOOOOO
CAN'T WAIT
I can not wait, I really want to see it soooooo bad 👏😀
😍😍😍😍😍😍
stop why did I think it got canceled
Guys, is the plot in season 1 same with the book?
Faphobia autoaexualphobic missgendering
Bees. Bourbon. Bridgerton.
I CANNNNNNT WAAAAAAAIIIT OMG
I’m excited but no Rege😩😩😩
Vintage gossip girl:)
i’m screaming
Argh lol I need this now lol 😆
I CAN'T WAIT😳🥺😱😳🥺😱😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
There couldn’t be a better timing since I finished the 2nd book
hopefully this season won't contain a romanticized and glorified r*** scene (:
Not watching. I don’t see Simon. 😒
God I hope they fixed that horrible bee sequence. I wish I could forget I ever read that trash. Season 1 was such an improvement over the book hopefully this continues.
Lady Whistledown returns with more scandal for us? Oh, I am in! 😏
omg
I can’t breathe!!
0:17 that's Daphne standing in the front on the left
I like the series, but why all jewelry always looks soooo cheap, can’t they at least use a better one on main cast?
ITS TAKING TOO LONG
AAAAA YAS QKKEKE XFIN EL ENEMIES TO LOVERS Q NECESITABAAAA
We need more parts of Penelope 🙏. She is the only reason I watched season 1
Who is that young black girl?
I'm ready for the drama.
Ooohh for a split second I thought it was season 3 of the Derry girls 😢
Nooooooooo! They made another season of that patriarchy-is-sexy garbage?!?!
If they don't reference the death stick in the season from the book I'm going to riot 😤
I’m so ready for Kate and Anthony to be at each other’s throats !!!!!!
This is literally gossip girl in the Victorian era
A good series to look forward to. Update: I was wrong! It wasn't good at all.  first season was totally different and authentic. It was nothing like it.
genuinely curious about who here has read the books and actually enjoyed them? i’ve only read the first three- well the first two, and a bit of the third- and i didn’t enjoy them as much as the show lol 😂
I hate myself for reading all of the books and already knowing the stories. 😩
omg i just can't wait anymore 😭❤️
Ngl, not a big fan of the books. The second book is the best out of the lot, even if the climax was weird. But I like the series anyway. Waiting to see what Shondaland does in the second season!!
Finallyyyyy😁
i saw that episode one is coming out, but it didnt say whether the entire season is coming out at the same time!!
I knew it
Omg I can’t wait!!!!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
vai ser tudo de bom
que lindooooo
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Daphne looks different and where is simon?
OMG I Can’t Waiiit !
I thought it was selena gomez in the thumbnail
I got goosebumps all over.
Waiting 😍😍😍❤️
I can’t wait for Kate and Anthony!!!! This one is my favourite.
FINALLY
I want it there right noe
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa can't believe it's coming back...I am so excited.
Omg the book is so good, look forward to this season!!!! We want alll 8 season!!!
I was on the fence about the early Whistledown reveal, but now I'm all hype. Love Pen and can't wait for Kate and Anthony's story!!
the way she looked away LMAOOO can't wait to see their banter and sexual tension!!
I can’t wait for March 25th😍😍
Can't see Eloise
this shit wll have 2 season???
I'm so ready!
Xoxo Lady Whistledown
The way she turned her head when he bowed his head she literally gave off “I’m unimpressed.” Energy🤣🤣🤣
I'm so excited, the season premiers on my birthday!!! <3
The Viscount who loved me ! has been my favourite of all the books , can't wait what Shonda has in store for us this season !!!

i’m so excited
Can't wait
Rayos, tenia que ser el día en que mi hermano se gradua... Uff tendré que aguantar no verla el día de su estreno. Al menos ya me leí el vizconde que me amo .
What is this multi-culti BS. You really think 19th century England was that "diverse"?
I was SHOCKED at Whistledown's identity. I cant wait for season two
Who feels Goosebumps as watching the trailer ?
YASSSSS
Ugh, the lead actress is dark. Good, the only thing that stopped me from full-on loving every piece of Bridgerton was the rampant colorism in the black casting. Now I can relax. And an INDIAN lead?? How exciting!
Ok so on 0:45 is it Anthony or Benedict??
this is the history liberals wish they had😂
Ork Lives Do Not Matter

Can't wait for the garden scene 🐝
I can't wait. Anthony is my fav bridgerton 😍

Netflix is regret Netflix is regret Netflix is regret Netflix is regret Netflix is regret Netflix is regret Netflix is regret
CANNOT WAITT!!
Can't wait ! 🥰🥰🥰
Lmao it's like the ending of the original planet of the apes when the monkee takes over
I used to think Bridget Jone's Diary was corny, lame, and full of cringe. But damn, the world is changing and producing cancer in even more concentrated amounts.
Noooooo, I have my exams in April! I'll have to resist the temptation for so long! Haha
But the title of this song in the background?
Got chills hearing Lady Whistledown and Penelope speak in tandem at the end.    My expectations for the series were low initially, but I ended up having a blast watching and recapping the first season, and I am ALL in for the second!
Where is the duke at.
Yes !!! return of Bridgerton , Umbrella academy and soon The crown thank you netflix !!!!
Can't bloody wait!!!!!
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Now please release official trailer
Can't wait for kathony to burn our screens. 🥰
❤️❤️❤️
Anciosa para ver a parte 2 😍
Ne yapayım Dükün olmadığı Bridgertonu
🗿🤲
Anthony's book has been always my favorite (albeit I only read the first four and it gets more disappointing each time). This season will be epic.
I can't wait to see what happens next!
Where is Anthony and Kate??? We want more of them...enough with lady whistledown..why is she so prevalent in all teasers??? The book is about anthony and Kate...
I wish someone would make a timeline like in what year everything happened: 1. Wedding of Daphne  2. Wedding of Anthony  3. Wedding Benedict 4. Wedding of Eloise 5. Weddings of Francesca  6. Wedding of Colin 7. Wedding of Hyacinth 8. Wedding of Gregory 9. Did Violet get married in the 9th book?   And when did all their children were born?
Woah
Wow
Goosebumps!!! Can't wait!!! Here for Kanthony & Polin. I am super keen for the Mallet of Death and the bee scene ngl
Привет от Леди Уислдаун))
We all knew Nicola was no supporting character.
Biggerton
I `m looking forward to it!!!
no but at the end of ss1, the bee appeared as a spoiler for ss2. aND WHAT IF AT THE END OF SS2, A MASQUERADE INVITATION/MASK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WILL APPEAR TO SPOIL FOR SS3?????
My favorite show ever.
It looks like tea
I just realized that the teaser we have right now is different from an official "trailer." This is probably why it's focused on Lady Whistledown, like they did in season 1 teaser trailer. There will be another trailer, perhaps 10-15 days before the release date. Hoping they keep the TRAILER focused on the main leads because Anthony's love story is magic.
Ugh I can't wait!!! 😬
I'm excited fr
Not gonna lie but only here for Eloise 😳
와 진심 흐긴년이 존잘 백인 유혹하는 설정 개역겹네ㅋㅋㅋ 그렇게 흐긴세상 원하면 블랙 브리저튼 찍지 일단 귀족 옷이며 머리 죄다 흐긴이랑 따로 노는구만 토나온다
I’m ready for the drama and the playlist.
Omg, finally!
I want to see it but hearing that each book/season focuses on different characters, I’m bummed. I want to see a continuation of Daphne and Simon, not have them become side characters.
Can I double like?
SO EXCITED FOR SEASON 2 AND FINALLY SEE MY KATHONY!!! 😭💗
I am so curious to see the relationship develop between Kate and Anthony. I am however very sorry that Kate and Edwina don't look at all like they are being described in the books
Magnificent sound..name of the song?!
So it's finally happening then....
YES PENELOPE! GET IT GIRL!! COME WITH IT
no puedos esperar más, no puedos esperar más, no puedos esperar más!!!!!!
So excited
THEIR CHEMISTRY ALREADY HAS ME ON THE FLOOR KATHONY OWN ME
😅😂🤣
Simonnn😭😭😭
I think they came out with the identity too soon It wasn't even that shocking because we didn't even have the tine to truly get intrigued Now, if it turned out not to be Penelope or that she was a front for someone else that would be interesting lol
This is such a wonderful series! I am so looking forward to it as not much else to watch that is worthwhile these days. Ive watched season 1 so many times I can probably recite the lines. So well put together and not a bad actor or actress in the entire cast that I can see!
😆😆😆🥳🥳🥳
Love the change from Anthony taking a bath to Kate fanning. This is going to be amazing!😁
Graha tia voicr actor in here
Whew Chile this season is going to be even hotter. She's stunning and her skin color looks like toffee.
You know at first I was a little annoyed they revealed lady whistledown so quickly but after hearing Penelope and Lady whistledown talk together idk it made me a lil excited
Oooh looking forward to it!! :D
I can't wait 💛💛💛💛
I love that it’s Penelope doing all of this so freakin’ much. Earning her own fortune, stirring the pot, having people envy her, on pins and needles clambering to see what she has to say…all while being overlooked and underestimated in her daily life. There’s always more to people than meets the eye, and it’s poetic justice if I’ve ever seen it. 😏
This season is about Anthony, and Anthony only. The duke doesn't need to be there. The story between Daphne and Simon has been concluded, they will have off-screen development but they are no longer the focus.  Come on, people. It's called Bridgerton for a reason. Simon was in the first season only because he played major part in Daphne's story, but it was about Daphne all along in season 1. He had little to no influence in Anthony's story, so there's no point in his appearance in season 2. It's great that he's so loved and missed, but it's time to focus on another Bridgerton.

Can’t wait! ♥️🔥♥️
AHHH
Ooh I can wait 💗😁👍🏾
Kate😋🐝
Here we again. Lady Whistledown isn’t stopping with her own crazy little antics anytime soon. Now I wonder if Daphne and spouse will ever show up in this season. I’m quite excited for this. I cannot wait to see more diverse people in the cast.
Well, I'll be watching the entire season in one day, like the first season. 😍😍😍
Show is trash
If only they’d drop ST4 trailer and release date
SCREAMING
What's up with the VO- it's been really badly edited
Never saw the first season. Any good?
Nice and assume teaser
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
this video is very interested and good thoughts
Bridgerton really was a global sensation because of Rege Jean tho :(( makes no sense without him
Finally
Feel the Vibe 🔥🔥🔥
Mind blowing teaser i love teaser .
Nice
*we don’t have a Duke 💀*
Kanthony all the way ❤️❤️❤️
The chemistry between jonathan and simone is going to be great. 👌
Omg I knew it was her all along...no one paid her any mind...
Anyone know when this series actually release??
lady whistledown we missed u
The kissing scene... Is that Benedict??!
I wonder if Colin is still gone in this season
I'd actually like to see Simon and Daphne's son
Excited can't begin to describe how I feel!!!
This season will be so goos enemy to lovers Kate queen lest go
When I tell u I was studying this trailer 😅❤️❤️
Yasssssssss ❤️💕
anthony i'm ready for you!!
YAY <33333333333333333333333
I don’t want to see no trailer until the evening of March 24th .. thank you 🙃
Bridgerton is more evidence of black people's inability to see themselves outside of white people. I call this "whiteness as benchmark," where everything is measured and cast in some form or version of whiteness, including white history, white values, white fashion, etc... Herein lies the fatal flaw in so much black film making, the inability to ask the question: who would black people be without white influence? Shonda Rhimes can't answer this question for her entire cinematic world view is rapped up in casting black people in white stories. Bridgerton is more of the same. No matter  how you cut it, Bridgerton is white supremacy in black face.
March 25th? 😭
So excited!!
YES YES I BURN FOR THE NEXT SEASON I NEED IT RN
I cant wait.....my bday is the 25th March
Oh my god yess🔥😭
Finally.! 😍 The wait is gonna be over soon.......
This season better be 10 episodes
You know maybe life is worth living, so I can see season 2 of Bridgerton
I've read all the books and I love all the changes, except one. Finding out who Lady Whistledown is in season one is a huge spoiler of a plot point that would have played very well on the screen. Otherwise, can't wait!
yang ditunggu - tunggu setelah berkali kali nntn season 1 😗
I’m so excited to see Kate Sheffield come to life 😭 she’s the character that I have related to the most since I started reading the books 🤎currently on “Romancing Mister Bridgerton”
so overrated show
DAMN. LOK AT THE BRIDGERTON’S all lookin gorgeous! and can’t wait to see anthony-kate love-hate kind of love
Rest In Peace my sleep the night of March 25th lmaoooo will definitely binge in one night 😂😂
Penelope is lady whistletion!
IM SO EXCITEEEEEEEEDD!!!!!
Happy that south asians are represented finally!!
I have a weirdly strong feeling simon will cheat on Daphne
HEEHEEEE OMG CANT WAIT BYE
Oh my goshhhhhh goosebumps!!!!
Looks great!
Such a Gossip Girl Spin to it 😅
when we found out who ms secret writer lady was, girl.. I lost my sh*t.  Its always the quiet ones!
Omggggg
Am I the only one who wishes that they hadn't revealed who whistledown was until S3??😭
I’M SO EXCITED I CAN’T WAIT!!!!!!!!
Wating for Lady Whistledown to start ending her news with, xoxo Gossip Girl
Omgggg omfffgggg
I'm so excited I can just cry😪😭😭😭
Can’t wait!!! 😩😩😩😩
I CAN’T FREAKIN WAIT FOR THIS!!!
the female lead has got to be one of the most beautiful women i've ever seen. she was in Sex Education too, right?
I love Penelope. She's a badass if you really think about it and it makes total sense that she is Eloise's best friend because those two are the two sides of the same coin. In this time, this is a very scandalous thing to do, especially for a woman.
Oh my God. Oh my fcking God.
So excited!! 😍😍
PUT SIMONE ASHLEY ON THE THUMBNAIL RIGHT NOW
period drama gossip girl
Since Anthony is fencing with Colin just wondering what will Benedict be doing in S3???🤭🤭🤭🤭😉😉😉🤭🤭🤭
Tambok
Penelope 😍 😍
Yaaaay daphne is still on s2 🥰
at 0:44 you can see Benedict doing the dirty for less than a sec, and i'm hoping its with Sophie!
YAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. so excited!!
this is gonna be awesome Anthony and Kate has this strong tension to hate each other, that's how romance works, and look it's a corgi
Gossip girl's period version
I loved Season #1 a whole lot. As much as I'm really looking forward to Season #2, it's gonna be extremely tough to surpass Daphne & Simon's love story.
Just finished s1 and wow, I'm excited
Not Daphne walking in on them 😂😂😂😂😂😂
As a fan and a reader of historical romance, this series gets  10 out of 10 on all marks.
I've been watching Amazon's Vanity Fair miniseries, and I'd highly recommend it for anyone who can't wait until March. It's another Regency-set show that's tonally very close to Bridgerton. (I have no involvement with it, I'm just watching it right now.) Also, I'd highly recommend the novel Vanity Fair to everyone, but especially anyone who likes Julia Quinn, Jane Austen, Georgette Heyer, or regency romances in general. It's from the 1840s and it's very much the missing link between Austen's writing and more modern styles.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
so excited for this 😭💗
ohhhhhh
Kathony!!!!!!!
Who's the big fat woman at the end of the trailer?
I just read the book lastmonth and it was so damn good.😊😁
NO MY DEAR DEAR PENELOPE I DON'T WANT HER TO BE THE SECRET LASY WHISTLEDOWN!!!
worst trailer ever I wish I will never come across just a bad trailer again
This and Gilded Age ( which got renewed ).. definitely enjoy
25th March pls come soon.
Can’t wait for this season!!! KATHONY ❤️
chillssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
finally it's Katie's season
Ducking hell…Anthony sans muttonchops and (presumably) naked in a bathtub 👀👀👀🔥🔥🔥🔥
may season na pla wow
Oh, Im gonna miss Simon!
Haven't read the books yet, but hoping the end of the season sees both the woman who was looking at Anthony and the younger woman who was dancing with Anthony with a happy or at least contented (which was really the best regency women could hope for, if not love than contentment and even if you end up with an idiot then hopefully he's not a cruel idiot) ending - and I'm also hoping that that snooty Cressida girl we met in season 1 will soon get married, then we'll only have to put up with her smirking at everyone rather than scowling at everyone.
Not the main point but I'm hoping that Penelope's sister Phillipa will marry that Mr Finch soon. The Featherington's could do with a break around now and having even one daughter respectably married with a degree of financial security will be a weight off Lady Featherington's mind. Of course there will likely still be whispers about the untimely and eyebrow raising circumstances of the late Lord Featherington's death, whether or not Whistledown writes about it the news will spread and there will be whispers about them, and in any case it would seem too suspicious for Whistledown not to mention it. In any case, we may finally find out who inherited the Featheringon estate, which probably will make Lady Featherington even more determined to get a daughter married so they won't have too live off the heirs 'kindness' or risk being thrown out by him.  Penelope must wish for it as well, if nothing else then she'll only have to live with one sister who's always making fun of her instead of two - though Philippa may be smug about it whenever she comes to visit and Prudence might be bitter about still being single and are it out on Penelope, it'll still be something of an improvement. Plus Penelope's no fool, she's bound to understand how having a married sister will improve living conditions for the whole family, herself included.
It's releasing on my bday and my exams are also getting over on that day I'm gonna finish the entire season on that night
I’m sooooo excited!!!
So daphne is there but Simon is now?
THE CORGI!!!
Newtonnn I seeeee uuuuu watch him play matchmker this season. Truly my favourite character next to Kate of course

God And Jesus love you
As a person who loves a good enemies to lovers story, im VERY VERY VERY EXITED
I love how they showed nothing and it still got us excited! I didn't really want spoilers.
I am not sure if it is more embarrassing or more pathetic, a historic take with black lords and ladies, laughable...immersion zero

I CANT WAIT FOR KATE & ANTHONY🔥🔥🔥Hottest Enemies to Lovers😍😍😍😍
Finally 😭😭😭🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
OMS = Oh My Shonda
Revelation 9 New International Version 9 The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss. 2 When he opened the Abyss, smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace. The sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the Abyss. 3 And out of the smoke locusts came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth. it's a movie 🍿🎥
OOO excited 😭😭😭😂😂❣️❣️❤️❤️❤️
who is Benedict making out with there...hmmmm
Pata nahi ginny and gorgea ka 2 session kab ayega
The fact that Bridgerton premiered during COVID and has already come out with a second season a bit more than a year later; while stranger things can't seem to get their shit together, speaks volumes!
is this fantasy or like actually based in england 16 century? cause ngl half of this cast would be looked at as half-breed monsters back then by the population. reason why i asked the question.
I cant wait to see my favorite mr Bridgerton, mr Anthony Bridgerton
CANT WAITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Sorry, just looks like a repeat of the first season with no Duke. Novelty has worn off for me.
O lv u nrtflix
I can't wait to watch it!😃
Too excited💃🏿
Oh look gossip girl😆

I'm waiting for the bee situation
my fave book in the series. i’m so excited.
Bello? Duke

OMG! Lady Whistledown ❤️
Is it weird I am not looking forward to it.......
Someone needs to remind Netflix that the season's protagonist is Kate Sharma and not Penelope Featherington.
Loveeee this show i hate Simon wont be back him and Daphne make the show
No more Duce and Duchess stories? I want more ☹️
EEEEPPPP
BRINGGGGG ITTTTT

Season 2! YOU MUST MAKE HASTE!  Edit:Thanks for the likes🥰
But no Regé this season… 😢
KANTHONY
The second book in this series is one of my favourite books of all time and it made me explore more books in the historical romance genre. I really hope that the series gives justice to the novel.
Season 2 obviously has a larger budget.
Wait…Siena and anthony again?  👀
Who did Daphne catch in the act? I can’t tell.
Yeeees we’ve missed you Lady Whistledown!!! And we can’t wait to have you back on March 25!!!
Rereading book 2 actually right now!!
Omg is that Benedict w/another mistress?! That did not look like madam lacroix, although we knew theirs was not a happy ending because of sophie.
I was waiting for this trailer for so long!!!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤ Thank you so much yo made my day! Kate and Anthony look perfect, that romance is going to be on fire 🔥🔥
OMG!!! ❤❤
I can’t wait for this 😭 i absolutely loved the 1st season 😍
aAHHHHH MARCK WHEN WILL YOU COME😭
On replay since the news broke me today. This month needs to end like yesterday please. I need march 25th now. Also, another bridgerton family shot without franny? Where is she?
Yes!!!!!! I made sure I finished the book before the new season came out. I’m so looking forward to see how Anthony and Kate’s story turns out in the series. As well as see what will Penelope aka Lady Whistledown do next. This show is one of the main reasons I am still a subscriber.
I’M NOT LYING WHEN I SAY I’VE WATCHED THIS TEASER ATLEAST TWENTY TIMES!! I’M SO EXCITED FOR KANTHONY!! 🐝💛
Looking at Newton (the corgi) whimpering at the suspense!
0:44 is that eloise ??
Love the Queen's smile!
NEWTON!!!
i swear to god, bridgerton is like alternate universe where black people were not slaves in that aristocrat era.
The Viscount who love me.
Ahhhh, Kate. The first book i have read. T'was the best.
*NOBODY CARES ABOUT SEASON 2 WITHOUT THE HOT COUNT!!! :P But fine, I'll still watch, I guess. :D*

My favorite book was the story about Penelope and Cole☺️☺️☺️
This what I been waiting for
OMG! I cannot wait to see this season! The hype is real.
Finally🥰🥰🥰
Finally!!!
Imagine having a best friend who takes all yours and your family's secrets, and exploits them to the entire Ton... All the while knowing it could bring on social ruin. How people don't find Penelope problematic is beyond me.
i just woke up aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH <3
I read all the novel again n again since the season 1 end as i wait for season 2
I waited the whole of Covid for this yay
I'm paying $20 a month for chick flixs... Great...

Political correctness makes it a fantasy series.

NEWTONNNNNNNNNN
The amount of times I’ve watched this is unhealthy. And……replay 😁
Who’s in 0:44? 😮
I cannot wait
Is it Anthony or Benedict making out naked with the girl? Also, do we know who that female is?
I feel like some of the anticipation is gone now that Lady Whistledown's identity has been revealed, but I'm kinda lookinjg forward to watching season 2 anyway.
This is the best series ever💚
oh, how woke.
Oh8gg8h
I rewatched this 5 times and I was wondering why everyone looked so much better
I want it to be march 25 now!!!!
I honestly wish that the identity of lady whistledown had remained a secret
Y'all I've been replaying it for a bunch of times, I can't contain my excitement
This season looks like it'll be better the first
The show that your husband says he doesn't want to watch, but then lingers in the doorway and eventually is as invested as you are.
I so missed you Bridgerton
Ughhh I hoped for a scene between Anthony and Kate😢
Finally it's here!
ALMOST A MONTH IM SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!
so excited for a South Asian romantic interest!!!
Oh, ok. So it's more of the same but this time she is a woman of color and he is a white man. Groundbreaking!
I hope im not being silly but was that a hyacinth lookalike in the sex scene😳
Xoxo Bridgerton
Can't wait....25 march seems sooooo Faaaaarrrr
IM GIOUING ATO PASS OUT
best book on the series by far
Yes we missed you Lady Whistledown! I can't wait until you grace all the homes of the ton in London.  Outrageous! That Queen Charlotte cannot get the better of you. Sharpen away dear Lady Whistledown.
i so excited season 2 but i going to miss one person in the drama 😿💘🎀
Uhh… did I just see what I thought I saw? The youngest daughter is the mystery writer?

This is the best netflix show ever! I am hyperventilating
Aaah não vejo a hora, tô tão ansiosa por essa temporada
Wow, way to include a major spoiler for season 1 right in the trailer for season 2 completely unecessarily.
I thought After was the most wattpad-ey it could get, but boy oh boy did this show prove me wrong
I'm so ready!!!! Gonna miss Simon but I'll stick enjoy the show just the same <3
I literally cannot wait! Feeling extra impatient now.
WATCH DO WE HAVE A PROBLEM.  Nicki minaj ft lil baby t

I wanted to know what happened so badly I bought the book and read it😂. Now I’m even more excited for this season and I would recommend the books to everyone who loves the show
The second book is by far my favorite!!! SO excited!
I can’t wait to see Kate and Anthony 😍
I know it’s revealed who lady whistle down is but is she really lady whistle down? Lol or is there a twist
I read the book a few months ago and loved it. It’s exciting to see it come to life ❤️
Not diverse enough unfortunately
Oh I cannot wait!
LADIES AND GENTS, WE’RE ENTERING THE KATHONY ERA
Que ganas!!!!
🥳🥳
AH HELL YEAH
🐝🫂🤍
omg has anyone else noticed that in that last shot where Penelope is speaking as Lady Whistledown, it’s the first time we’ve ever seen her wearing anything other than bright yellow??? I’m thinking that as she embraces the infamy of secretly being Lady W. she’s also going to start outwardly rebelling against her mother more and really come into her own as a character. can’t wait!!
Enemies to lovers nation are we ready for this?
Finally 😍😍😍
i can’t wait
Omg yasss
Bridgeton: I've been sharping my knives for all of you Me: it's about to go down
This wins over the gg reboot…. Let’s have 12 seasons
Omg i have been waiting!!
I want to hear love rumors about Eloise Bridgerton from the Bridgerton family. She doesn't look like her sister at all. He must be a handsome gentleman whom she could fall in love with too.
its game time bitches
yeeeyeeeeeeee
KATHONY OWN ME ALREADY
KATHONY SEASON IS THE BEST SO TRUE
Omg finally! I can't wait. I'm probably gonna re-watch season 1 so I can refresh my memory.
Finally the Narrator reveled.
A reminder that God loves you so much and Jesus died for your sins💗💗
Glad to see the beautifully chubby Nicola Coughlan is back she looks even bigger can’t wait.
oh snap!!!
I can‘t wait!!!
🐝🐝🐝🐝
GRAHA TIA
I'm looking forward to them 18th century-ing more modern music! 😂
The better have the croquette match or I’m going to riot. It will be a small riot, but a riot nevertheless.
Oh my god bridgerton 2 is 😍😍😍😘
Finally! The teaser 💃 Just read the book and love it This season looks amazing
just finished reading the viscount who loved me so i'm so stoked for this season!
Can't wait
Can't wait🥳🥳
they dropped it on Valentine’s day and everything <3
Oh no, this isn't enough!!! Can't wait for the season 2😭
I'm ready...I'm ready...I'm reaaaddddyyyyy
Gays or we Riot
Ok but can we like talk about the corgi in there 😭🥰
I forgot to finish season 1 lol
I got up at like 1:00 AM Christmas morning to binge watch season one, no regrets. Looks like I'm taking March 25th off of work this time.
Literally every single thing in this is perfect, all the actors, the clothes, the vivid colors, the flowers, AND NEWTON obviously. Kate looks impeccable and so does Edwina, I'm head over heels in love 😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love Penelope but nothing beats Julia as lady whistledown voice. I'm so ready for the new season. Anthony and Eloise are my favorite
Estoy super emocionadaaa... No puedo esperar :3
I just found out we are getting Edmund for this season! So glad they didn't remove that part of the book.
God I can wait for the soundtrack for this season
NO!
Oh goddd🥰🥰🥰🥰 The waiting is difficult for me now.💖
So, Anthony and Kate will meet during horse ride. She said in first look "Your character is as deficient as your horsemanship". And maybe her sister will also get attracted by Anthony. I dunno
I have this on my phone calendar!  😍🤩🤣
*WHAT???? OMG OMG OMG I'M SOOOO EXCITED!!!!!!*
Had to Google where it was set because no way is it in my country of England, way too many black faces for the time.
I CAN NOT WAIT
Yes finally
Someone tell me what this trailer song is! New Kris Bowers music??
I kind of wish they hadn’t revealed who lady whistledown is yet but i’m excitedd
KATE BEING ALL HOT AND BOTHERED UMM YEAH WE LOVE TO SEE IT
They rode horses so gossip girl could walk lol
It just hit me that Bridgerton is like the Gossip Girl of the 19th century
Wait wait in that one scene, is it Benedict and some girl? Cause it doesn’t look like Anthony 👀..  also who did daphne saw?  well I want answers now please😫
Impressionante como o Anthony ficou mais rejuvenescido sem as costeletas da s1
Is the release date of the 25th of March also the same for France ?
PQP SO VÊM
Ich liebe Kate mit all meinem meinem glitzer ❤️♥️
Yes yes we did miss you 😭❤️
Am I the only one who was looking for Benedict and Henry in this teaser? I really do hope both of them will show up in this season as well, 'cause they're one of my favorite characters. But anyway, from what I heard about the book, Kate sounds like an interesting characters and I'm truly, really excited for her.
YES SHE IS!!
Oh I was watching video essay type stuff earlier and a Bridgeton one from last year popped up. Ooh the timing
Preparada para ver Edmund e Violet?? Nem um pouco porém também sim e muito ansiosa
Vendo tudo em slow motion porque eu não quero perder nadaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
So excited for this season! It's based on one of my favorite books in the series. 💕
Can't wait to watch it. Kate Sharma 💙
Uhhhhh wasn't we supposed to know who's the lady whistledown in 3rd season???
Cadê os brasileiros nesses comentários, abelhinhas apareçam. Estou tão ansiosa. Ainda não acredito que é real mano. Finalmente chegou a vez do meu casal, se fui triste não me lembro
I'm so excited for Newton, there's a glimpse of him in this trailer😍😍😍
Will this only be 8 episodes? Ugh. Wish we could at least get 10.
I reallyyyy hope they included the pal mal game like in the books! It would be hilarious
Its not gonna be as epic as the first one i can sense it from the trailer
Yes!! 👍🏾
Ugh I will miss Simon so baaadddd
HEARTSTOPPER TRAILER.
Hahahah, MDS, meu coração não aguenta de ansiedade.
I love this!
THIS IS SO SEXY🥵 IS THERE ANY WAY TO JUMP TO MARCH 25 AT THIS MOMENT?????
I loved the book . It is one of my favourite reads because it had romance with witty comments and It was super funny at times . I don't want the story to be twisted that much ..I like the original so much that I am kinda sacred to watch the show 😅 because it may ruin the book for me but it my concern for those who haven't read the books it's grt for them
Nah, lost it's appeal to me when they revealed her too early. Now I'm just in it for the sex.
I am so READY
AHAHHQ IM SO EXCITEDDDDD
Hope series will as interesting as book🙌
I cant wait I'm super excited
cant waitt
I am so excited for the second season!
Can't wait 😍
Am out.
Ahhhhh 😍😍😍😍 Amazing😍😍😍
I LITERALLY GASPED

YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...EEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS HONET!!!!!!!!!

I need this NOW! Not March 25TH!!! 😂
I'm so glad Julie Andrews is still giving the voice for Lady Whistledown
Can't wait need it now !!!?
I’m so excited!! This means I have to reread the book for the 10th time now!! 😭🖤
Super excited for the season and eagerly waiting to know who's the lady with Benedict?I don't think they ll introduce Sophie in Season 2.
I am simply deceased.
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IVE BEEN WAITIMGGGGGMDNSKAKSMAKAKAKWK
avg 1k views every 45 seconds...the children are ready to be fed
i am so excitedddd
Oh my gosh I saw Kate’s CORGI!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
Hopefully they'll let Penelope start to pick her own clothes this season. In the book her mother starts to give up on her getting married so she can do what she wants.
love to see it
Bestest thing about bridgerton is each season the focus will shift from one couple to another. Each season will bring a new love story, new couple. All  bridgerton siblings will get the opportunity to shine. That's the best part. Can't wait for benedict's season and francesca's season.
YASSSS FAMMMMM WE MEET AGAIN!!! My gurl Eloise looking SO LOVELY! Nice to Benedict again too!  BUT WAIIIIT WHO IS THE COUPLE MAKING OUT?
OMGGH
Where is the duke🙃
im so excited, Netflix, please don't cancel this show
Yes! Season 2 of my guilty pleasure.
March 25th can't get here fast enough!!
OoooMmmmGgggg!!
🙌
I'm literally SCREAMING right now. Can't wait to watch this season!!!!!!
Yes! Bring on Bridgerton season 2! We have been salivating for this!
I’ll be thinking about the Duke the WHOLE time I’m watching this!!
AAAHHH KANTHONY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am definitely going to cry during the flashback scenes of Anthony and Edmund. 😭
So exciteddd
Where is simon
Ok. Am I the only one who can't count properly how many time have I watch this trailer?
I c'ant wait I am so excited
Who is the couple that Daphne appears to walk in on? at 0:44
Oh my god....they all look sooo beautiful.I don't know how I am going to survive till 25th March.
SCREAMING OMG
I’M READY PLZZZ GIVE ME
Waiting for lady whistledown that how she will reveal her identity.. . . Can't wait to see this Epic❤️
I can't wait!
Well the 2nd book is way better than the first book. And what they did with the first book was great so I expect the 2nd season to be way better. They have more budget and a way better story with very good dialogue and dynamic between the ML and the FL. And the cast is really good so I’m excited
Dude, this looks like it has just the right amount of drama and spice.
Finally😱
Day 121 of waiting for the Dead to me season 3 trailer👩‍🦯
sigh, i already miss the Duke of Hastings
I seriously screaming with all that I have in me. The best serie on planet earth is coming back. 😍❤️
Anthony's book is my favourite of the whole series and they're going to ruin Kate for me. If they make her a freaking feminist...god! she's strong willed, funny, smart and not afraid to stand up to a viscount but she doesn't go around preaching about sex desigualities (english?) i loved her for knowing herself and her own mind and in that time a woman like that was rare. that was enough. that picture with kate holding a riffle...of the way she answers to Anthony...what the hell... i'm in hopes that we get pall mall and then the stormy night scene. they were the pivotal moments in the book. that's when they both changed the views and learned respect for each other.
I CAN’T WAITTT!!!
I CAN'T WAIT I CAN'T WAIT I CAN'T WAIT PLEASE DROP SOONER!!!
Oh shit
Lol, that's my hand at 0:10
This was my biggest question: Whether Penelope would speak for Lady Whistledown or will we hear Julie Andrews again.  But hearing them together now has increased the anticipation for the season 2 like anything🤩
I don't understand is this a fantasy series or from some time in the past ? Because how can black people be aristocrats in time of slavery, isn't it denial of history ? I mean its a sad time in human history but i was real :(
Be still my beating heart 💗
Yesss pen i missed you 🥰🥰🥰🤩
Oh my freaking God 🙏🔥🦋
Can’t wait ❤️❤️
the cocky head tilt from anthonyt🔥i’m a sucker for enemies to lovers!!
The time when Anthony tipped his hat and Kate straight out ignored😚
KANTHONY’S COMING🐝🐝
I AM SO EXCITED LESSS GOOOOO
no mamen que hermoso es esto voy a llorar de la emoción
It's here! It's here! It's here!
who did daphne catch? 😱😱😱😱😱
chills. cant wait
When Kate is ignoring Anthony lokks so good... I'm already in love
Oh, so many beautiful places, great story of Anthony and Kate, Eloise with her debiut and Pen... I cannot wait 6 weeks!
😍😍😍 can’t waiiiiittt
I am screaming with joy! This season looks extremely wonderful with great chemistry and gossip ❤❤
"Did you miss me?"  Yes. Yes I did.
Finally!!!! I've waited over a year for this.🤩
My suspension of Bridgerton is strengthening
OMG I CAN'T WAITTTT!!!! and LOLOL @0:35 this is how I always imagined Kate react to Anthony in the books HAHAHAHAHAHA <3. Looks like my favorite book of the series will be given justice ;)
watched this back in 0.75 speed lol
yahhhhhhhh!!
Nobody cares about this show we want stranger things 4 trailer and Netflix you are actually dumb for not at least announcing the release date at the Super Bowl
Omg cant wait!
If we don't get an entire episode for the pall mall scene, are we even winning.
Ой ждуууу🥰
Ahhh I can't wait for Kate and Anthony's story! Their book was my favorite in the series.
I can't wait to watch this show.
I’ve been waiting for the trailer to drop since morning 😭
I AM SO EXCITED 😍
The real star isn't goin to be in this season I just hope that it's still good like the first season 😍😍😍
WAITING ,WAITING , WAITING .These are the three words I only can say...
I'm so excited 😁😁😁
Who’s ready to watch the entire season in one night? 🙌🏾
I Wonder Who’s Gonna Replace the Duke Since the actor Left the Show?
This trailer is very cringe I’m not gonna lie.
I've waited for this season, im so eager!!!
Does Daphne walk in on them 💀
Omg!!! Kanthony is everything 🥰
Omggg
Omg I can't wait
omg I can't wait! Currently reading the book so that I know what to expect for Anthony and Kate lol
About time
📢 WE GOT THE TRAILER
does someone know when derry girls season 3 will come out?
gosh, finally what i've been waiting for, for whatever reason i miss and can't wait to watch this series, for whatever reason im very happy~~
Did they send Simon to learn the pianoforte with Aunt Winnie in Bath and miss Anthony's engagement to Kate?
I'm trying to get known so I can buy Land, Subscribe!!!!!!
I'M FREAKING OUT
Wait is that the actress from sex education ?
My mom won’t let me watch it but I rllly want to uhghhhh
No wonder the stock is crashing, keep making these trash series untill you become a pennystock
If you're a sucker for the enemies to lovers trope, you would certainly love this season!💗🐝
Daphne and simon wont be in season 2 ?
Eloise finally has way bettee hair. Holy cow, she is so pretty!!!
Here we again. Lady Whistledown isn’t stopping with her own crazy little antics anytime soon. Now I wonder if Daphne and spouse will ever show up in this season. I’m quite excited for this. I cannot wait to see more diverse people in the cast.
0.45 Benedict ???
THE TENSION BETWEEN KATE AND ANTHONY IS SO PALPABLE
ALELUIA VOU VER O PATRÃO NEWTON
OMG.. Who did daphne see? Is it sienna and anthony?

PENELOPES STORY! MY FAVORITE BOOK OF THE SERIES! YESSSSSS!!!!
All of us are dead for  season 2 very very excited
I'm in shock at such perfection, come KATHONY 🐝🐝🐝
This has made my Valentine's Day!
I love Pen so much !  I hope they fix her book because for how much I adore Polin their story is a bit underwhelming
is 00:44 Benedict and Sophie????
I CANNNOT WAIT OMGGGG
😍😍😍
My mother fan girls over this and honestly it’s quite adorable
this season is going to be so good!!!!!!!!! Kathony will deliver everything!!!
I'm just for Queen Kate, the only person I could tolerate in the books! I hope we get to see a lot of her and her family.
LADY WHISTLEDOWN IS READY TO SERVE SOME MUCH NEEDED TEA
The way I can feel the chemistry seeping through my skin...bring Kathony on!!!!
Looking forward to it💝
LITERALLY SCREAMED WHEN I SAW THIS OMG
it's just a teaser but im blushing >///<
So are we going to forget that Daphne raped Simon? Nothing against the actress but I really hope the character gets less screentime this season.
WOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OH MY GOD IM SO EXCITED
SO EXCITED FOR KATE AND ANOTHONYYYY
dont tell me francesca is staying with aunt billie this whole season too LMAO
can't wait, so excited for season 2
I can't tell you all how loud I screamed seeing this!  Their story was my favorite in the book series.  I'm super duper excited!!!!!
I'm so excited for this. If its as good as the book then we are in for a real treat. I wonder if we'll see any of Penelopes story since we now know she's Lady Whistledown
ohmygodohmygodohmygod i cant handle this omfg
1. Finally! AHHHHHHH! 2. Who did Daphne see kissing? I hope it's Anthony and Kate. 3. I know the story. I've read the books. But still, it's so weird to see Edwina with Anthony because of all the videos, images, teasers I've seen from season 2 with Anthony and Kate. 😜
oh my goshhhhhh
Ahhh I can’t wait 😍❤️🐝🥰
I’m still so confused about how Penelope is Lady Whistledown when that woman talks of nothing but sex, marital relations and advice and yet Pen didn’t even know how a girl gets pregnant?! 😓
I just died and went to heaven
Yes Lady Whistledown, we know. We know everything 😉🐝❤️ I AM SO EXCITED!!
OH MY GOSHHHHHH I'M SOOOOOO EXCITED!!!!!! TIME TO REREAD THE BOOK AGAIN FOR THE 50TH TIME!!!
Now I have to finish the book bro I am so hyped for this season  ....

Got chills hearing Lady Whistledown and Penelope speak in tandem at the end.    My expectations for the series were low initially, but I ended up having a blast watching and recapping the first season, and I am ALL in for the second! 👏👏👏
I can't wait any longer! 💕🐝
Season One: When A Bad Boy With A Serve Case Of Daddy Issues Falls In Love With A Good Girl. Season Two: Bad Boy Vs Overprotective Big Sister Who Ends Up Getting Together. Yeah, it’s goanna be good.

Yo? La persona más feliz
Yessss
The writing, acting, sets, everything about Bridgerton is first rate. Love it. But Penelope’s character is entirely too young to have the experience and perspective to be Lady Whistledown. Just saying.
Eagerly waiting for Kate to shut Anthony down multiple times!
