R32 gets a tidy up! Still a bunch to do but atleast it's more usable now. BIG Scirocco update coming in a few days!
Can you swap a r32 onto a mk5 jetta
I had a 2006 Golf GTI that VW replaced the wings on FOC. They didn't refit the foam bits!😂
Wheres the rest of this build?
What’s happened to the R32?
Alhamdulilallah
Id like to do a project like this but cheapest r32 around here is 15K euros xD
9:20 why is it common to be rusty around the badge area on the trunk/boot ?
WHAT OIL CAN I PUT INTO MY GOLF5 TDI 2006
Hyped for part 2 🎉
Perfect garage
wheres part 2
2.500 for a r32 wtf
When the wing fell apart! 😂😂😂
This will always be a beautiful car
Oh man i need a R32
Can anyone in the UK explain why you call it a 3 or 5 door? In the U.S. we say 2 or 4 door. Our 3 door would be like a Hyundai Veloster. Are you all climbing through the boot? You alright?
VAG still use the  sound deadening sponge in the front wing. You'd think they'd have learned over the years but no.
Tu parle trop

2500 euros for a Golf R32? I do not believe
Still the best car ever made! That sound 😍😍😍
Not much of a VW guy but the Mk5 Golfs have always looked good imo
Just picked up a white one of these in the US. #4196 These videos are super helpful!
Could you let me know what part number the foam thing is that is on top of the battery? Mine is missing and i think it is R32 specific.
elbet bir gün bize de nasip olur inşallah...
Looks really good🔥😍
Abi şu videolara türkçe alt yazı eklesen
Wow. Parts prices are CHEAP for you guys compared to the USA
Dayıoğlu Türkçe altyazı ekleseydin keşke be
Nice ! I really liked my MK5 R32 could have done with some forced induction though.  R50 with a V10 TT RS6 engine next!
Hamza back with a bang mods looking mad always a vw fan, eBay is good for all parts I can’t wait to see the r50 complete the whole set that would bang then but keep it up bro
Postcode on the ebay listings :(
should i keep my MK5 R32? having multiple electrical issues. 1st gear hopes the engine i put new stock mounts but didnt solve the problem. someone said my driveshaft bushing needs to replaced. have experienced any 1st gear hop? also 1st ignition coil popped out with spark plug should i get a new block or whats my best option? still attached sounds great every time has high flow catts with APR muffler. want to turbo but worried about trans handle the power has 130k on trans
Never been a fan of the Valeo’s on the Mk5
Looking good TR.
The rear lights are from the Jetta !!!!!
Your content is next level and the level of effort put into these builds is impressive- long time subscriber and you’ve come a long way from your driveway projects 👌
Be sure to get that rust on them sill sorted. Loving this content!
Sick video mashallah
You have to buy the bucket seats! They are awesome 👍🏻
dont forget to change the rear fog lamp bulb on r32! blue is really nice!!!
Great video. I’ve a mk5 exactly the same with 11k miles from new. I love the mk5
Being a former Mk V R32 owner myself (a 5 door in Tornado Red), I am looking forward to see which direction you will take this cheap Mk V R32.  It's already starting to look so much better with the bodywork you've done so far, so pls. hurry up with the next episode! 👍👍
Great video, massive VW fan 😎🤙🏽🇩🇪
Good work man
I own one aswell WWWWWWW
Very nice project bro 👌👌
Great work Hamza as always 💪🏻
Simply extend the wires for fog and reverse so they work
Daha çok video atman lazım sıkılıyoruz :D :D
I love what you doing TM…. Giving life back to old legends. Great content bro 👍🏻👍🏻
Looking so good 😍😍
Great job
Love your channel and love the R32 R36  Always looking forward to your new episodes  I have a 06 R32 black magic pearl and cherish it in my garage I’ve spent a lot to make it mint  Brilliant work thank you good luck
VALEOS AGAIN LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO
Cant wait for the touareg build!!!!!!
At 16:05 you say the wing is R32 specific, it's not, but I assume you meant the colour is, so you couldn't find a used one?
Following this, just bought an 08 plate r32 in DBP with the elusive wingbacks, fixed the issues it had with control module, wasn’t locking and now currently taking the rubbish mods off and putting back to standard, back lights swapped out for originals, it has the bbs ch off the edition 30 on it so will swap them out in future. Also has a coloured coded grill. Very well painted but looks rubbish.   I’m also in Scotland btw, corossion on mine is on lower sill and round the back badge
New lights have the back looking wider! Big fan of them
VRSEX🥰
Love the sound of these also the R36 very nice and rare motor😊
Nice job 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Couldnt you just tap into and extend the wires across the tailgate for the reverse/fog so they work as they should but are just on different sides? Way easier than splitting the lenses off
Let's get the R32 rolling 🤝
intrested in how you sort the seat plusg out, my front seats are shot and looking for options..
I remember the M140 putting a big smile on your face.  The prices have dropped so much recently so might be worth another punt.
❤‍🔥
bro we want the 8R content
Missing your wagon video
Hi TR, have you ever had any problems with a soaking wet passenger footwell? Any ideas of what i could check to stop it? There is enough water to house ducks. 3door mk5 edition 30 gti no sunroof. thanks
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
If the inner rear lights are going to be original keep it all original, it will look better. Unless there's a way to flip the inner ones so the fog and reverse are changed
i owned a 3-door R32 of this type from 2005-2008 with DSG, it was a great car having an incredible sound, but also some call-back issues already new! Became a new transmission within the first year of ownership...
This must be the best duo of car any VW enthusiast can have.
Really enjoying these videos! Love a good restoration! Keep up the good work bro😁💪
I love my polo bluegt got very similar wheels bitch to clean tho 😂
Looking forward to a full respray and all the rust sorted
My mk5 rabbit had emblem rust on hatch after 2 years ownership.  Few days at maaco and they fixed it well 👍💪🤙
Waiting for the non res miltek i had one sounds epic tr👌👌
little brother meets big brother! loving the content hamza!
Did you seriously just had to market ebay? Lmao, they lost the market or what?
Can’t wait to see what you do to tackle the door sils, I have to do mine soon and have been looking for different options to fix them
Babe, wake up! TRHamza just uploaded!
You want to sell them wheels you took of that mate ?
Bro where can I get that cordless ratchet wrench from?
Need the Touareg asap
Smashing it
It’s crazy how good your videos are these days. Been watching for years now good to see you progressing
Just love R36
Hamza, please drop weekly videos!!
Good move to go for the Omyants, those Zolders (and the Solitudes on the B6 Passat) are an absolute pain to keep clean - too many spokes!
Better not take too long with part 2
Killer car collection in the making.
I have the zolders on my DBP R32 (they came with 55 and 06 cars with the omanyt coming on 07 onwards IIRC) I actually prefer the zolders and agree it’s more MK4 esque. Pain to keep clean though! Love this content it’s so much better than the driving vids imo 👌🏻
Coming along nicely!
Love this guy
I think those different wheels look much better anyway 🙂! Plus love the new tail lights
No airbag light even with the airbag connectors not connected, hmmm 😅
Looks 👌🏽👌🏽love your work bro
Seats were a great idea not really a fan of the lights at all
The price for the tailgate seemed like a steal! Good job mate, excited for the next one!
Hamza great videos but need to be more longer
Can’t wait to see all your cars fully restored for real bro keep up the hard work it will eventually pay off
Loving these videos bro mashaAllah, keep up the consistent content!
Early MK5s have a different airbag plug (yellow plug). You can easily solve this with some adapters from ebay. The little black plug from your Scirocco seats however are for the heated seats. In early MK5s they are connected to the car over the main plug (big one). So you basically have look at the main plug from your old seats and pin them in accordingly.
Tinted rear glass as well
Coming along nicely I think gun metal grey would suit the alloys and also silver side mirrors matching the grill
The pair look great together just missing the R50, hopefully see that on your channel soon great work👌
Great watch
Hamzas unit is looking like a VW R specialist😂
Will this fit an a3 8p? Should do right?
Hamza you make it look sooo easy man. I just barely wash my car and you changing wings and seats and bootlids and all sorts. Make me feel lazy 😂😂😂 jokes aside your smashing it brother ❤
Good job, looks way better now! But i prefer de oem r32 seat over the scirocco ones. It Just looks off.
a R50 would go crazy
Great build bro 👌👌
Need a R50 to complete that set of cars
Also get the valeo lights on the mk5 Jetta only on some models, I’ve got them on a 2.0 TFSI makes the car look newer then what it is 👌🏻 loving the mk5 R32 build
You can code the rear lights (VCDS) to swap the reverse and fog light to have them work correctly, I guess the only issue is MOT as I believe the rear fog must be on the driver's side..
If you’re not too bothered about the fog and reverse light been the wrong way round, you can bell the fog and reverse feed out and swap them over mate saves you dismantling the Valeo’s👍🏻
The car is coming together quickly and starting to look clean was waiting for this video, lots of surport from South Africa brother 🤝💥🔥💪👌
Valeo also available on AUTODOC
Coming along nicely!
Lovin your work ,,keep it up cant get enough of the vw content🤟
Stage 2
Been watching since the s3 days ,Mashallah you have grown so much
Best bucket seats for a s3 8p ? Don’t really have 2k for s3 wingbacks
Doing an amazing job on the car. However, have to be honest, the seats don't really look good in the car. I personally like original myself.
Really enjoying this R32 project!
Hamza, Do you know if MK5 R32 seats will fit an Audi B7?   Edit:  Spray the inside of that new wing with Hammerite before it gets painted.  It will never rust out again.  Hopefully.
Love the R32,  personally I'd leave the wiper delete.
Them seats are mega what a class idea .  I have the ones you swapped heated .  So are these new ones heated you put in ?.  I rarely use my R32 and it's needed the powersteering rack  replacing which is due to be installed the weekend after 2 months out 😂
Love watching this channel brilliant love that r36
Is it possible to do a twin charge? I am just curious
Little bit of tlc goes along way
When i had my r32 you used to produce loads of mk7 content. Now i have a mk7 R and and you have the r36 and r32 resto videos. I miss my r32 and these videos aren't helping 😢.  Great videos as always, keep it going 👍
When part two? 😔
Yes, looks much beter 👍
Looking well better 👌
I love your restoration videos, just good stuff
You want to get that sill sorted before you think about painting?
I like alot ❤
Nice work. Not sure on the rear lights tho 🤔
Nice video bro r32 looks well mint now❤❤😍
TR fancy a straight swap for my e87 1series 118d msport 👍👍
Brilliant stuff bro
Beautiful car for the price but I could never justify buying one even for £2500 as these cars have been taxed out almost £695 a year tax is crazy
I feel like the scirocco seats are a bit low to work in a golf. Otherwise good work.
Where the 335i content ???
Get that painted the same colour as the R36…
Hamza you do everything properly and ur videos are a joy to watch
Should give the skyline mod a go on the valeos, I've done it on my Jetta and looks incredible
euro tails makin me jealous, I got some that ended up being ripoffs with part of the LEDs dead, now I can only find the tail lights for around 600 bucks
The loom looks long enough to run the cables to the opposite sides for the inner lights. 13:28
The VR6 king of youtube 👌
Those Valeo rear lamps are 🐕💩 🤮
this video just made my whole week better lol always fun watching u wrench on these VWs keep up the awesome work man!!!!
Patiently waiting for those side skirts to come off and see what’s underneath 👀😂👍🏻
Feel you should of got a blue Scirocco r aswell 🤣
Damn rust restorations are so satisfying but you need a lift for all that sadly😂
Mk5 gti on my page check it out!!
Great to see this build progressing Hamza ❤🎉
That made some difference and it looked so easy. Loving the channel
BOOSTED R32 build YES!!! I'm spoiled living in the southern part of the United States we seldom have to battle rusty vehicles. We don't have any snow or road salt to deal with.
Looks great
👍🏻
I'm  really thinking about buying an r32 they sound epic,love your builds Hamza😊
Currently doing a r32 right now so i cant wait to see how this turns out
I soggy piece of foam destroys your car great work vw 😢
Nice fleet 👍🏼
R50 touareg next
Getting there... Looking good.... 👍
Have a look at Wigan vag for seats. Maybe slightly damaged ones as well.
Always love seeing a hamza video pop up in my subscriptions
Always a good day when TR uploads! 🔥🔥 Waiting for that R50, can't wait for the mad trio! R32 looking much nicer now.
Mashallah hamza
R32 gets a tidy up! Still a bunch to do but atleast it's more usable now. BIG Scirocco update coming in a few days!
