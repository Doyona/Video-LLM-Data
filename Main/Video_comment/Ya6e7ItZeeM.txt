Same story after the 3-1 loss to arsenal in 23/24
Yet here the fans are blaming Ronaldo 😂
United went in thinking they could counter attack like they did with Liverpool and arsenal. When you go into a game with a 4-2-3-1 formation it tells everyone that you are expected to be defending a lot, and have less possession. It's what the lower clubs do when they go and play away at better teams expecting to get beat. All negative. City go in every week with a positive 4-3-3 attacking attitude and to control the game in midfield and possession. Playing defensive on counter attacks is more hopeful tactics than anything else. Your hoping you get a chance to counter attack and when you do it goes perfectly, but that's not always going to happen. So you defend, counter attacking opportunities are few and far between and when you do get one, you get cut out as city read it well and come back at ya.
Central midfielder - they know the game
Keane is a Legend. Facts are facts
We are in a transition process, City are league ahead, this will take time.
First of all how can Man U manager not play Casemiro and Ronaldo? They’re world experience players and they should have been played. What an insult to both players. I’ll in January if I was Ronaldo and he’s still the 🐐 🐐🐐💯🙌
Rent a mouth keane...
like roy or not, no one can deny he knows what hes talking about
Shameless betting ads you can't skip, and can't even choose to stop seeing it.
Change the record roy 🙄
6-3 doesn’t even represent it, Guardiola always makes subs when there’s a 5 goal deficit (crazy this city side is good enough to have 5 goal lead protocols). Could have been 8+ if they pushed. United were terrible, getting close but not actually putting tackles in, just running next to the city players, a lot of players hiding and protecting themselves from blame
I remember when Man City was crap before the sugar Dady came in they always give us a game the same can’t be said for this united bunch.🤮
Remember when the English would say say the SPFL was a 2 horse race well well now you guys have a 1 horse race. Nobody can catch City.
Man City, one of the best teams I’ve seen, in the last 5-6 yrs ? When Liverpool won the League and have turned them over a few times, I’ve still insisted, Man City are the best team !  From a Liverpool fan and at last heard it last week, McGuire has nothing in front of him for the last two years, which makes him, look even worse than his form suggests, he’s gets caught a lot of the times, because he’s also doing the midfields work & when you can’t relax, you make mistakes ?  ✌️☮️
Best thumb nail ever 😅😅
City have bought it 90%.go round the world hijacking all best players .and ignoring ffp
Keane: 14 games unbeaten against Man city.....different man city back then
😂😂😂 💙🤍💙
City are a better team and club united are a young project now under Ten hag five seasons needed and still I wouldn't bet we will be at City level ever under Glazer Ownership
It was a game with two halves.
What is that high pitched noise in the background of so many of these clips - I notice it on the TV too 😐
Man utd players are bottlejobs have been for so long these players can string 15 good games together then go back to playing like absolute wasters
United are hilarious to watch 😂💀
Give anyone the freedom of the midfield s8itty Watford or Brentford and you get rolled over. Tactically naive from Manchester United
Roy Keane, after every United Game goes on a rant. There is no weight in his words anymore. He doesn't care about other 19 teams in the league!
I can always picture Roy giving out to his kids "you said you'd put the bins oouut, not good enough, sloppy, a lack of urgency... simply not good enough, should be embarrassed, at the end of the daaay"
I don't see why they should be embarrassed. Man City are much better. Everyone knows that, so it's not some kind of surprise or shock that the Manchester United players should be embarrassed about.
If Maguire played, it would've been 10-0 to City.
I always enjoy Man Ure getting hammered off anybody & the trauma of the Man Ure legends
Roy Keane definetly needs to become Man Utd manager at some point, he might not win them titles however he will at least get the club back into the right path and earn the respect of his team.
Ten Hag should take some of the blame. United looked like they didn't know what they were doing.  Especially with Citiy's full backs getting forward. The defending was poor.
Crikey yow wanna try and be a suffering Wolves fan 😝
I had to keep asking myself who was up front for United in this game. The answer was Rashford but he may as well not have got off the bus. Ronaldo isn't great defensively but I refuse to believe he could have been as poor as Rashford. The lad McTominay was totally out of his depth. Casemiro should have started, at least he knows what Antony looks like, McTominay kept confusing him with Man City players!
It's Keanes fault Haaland plays for City. He should have been done for GBH ruining his father's career. Funny.
They get paid £millions even if they lose - and that is the issue right there............
City are just miles better than any other team on earth. Outclassed. Simple
So whats the solution Keano? Break Halaand juniors legs lol
But he put them  all in one team so it was cheating.
Easy for Keane to say, in his day, he was playing in the team that was head and shoulders above all others. Did he ever question his opposition?
😂😂😂😂here we go again, next thing it’ll be get the glazers out again….pathetic!!!!
I love roy keane hes the most honest pundit out there who knows how to play football .how he's not managing a club I never no .my mates a forest fan .so do you fancy the city ground roy ???
Bruno is the most overrated player in the prem, never shows up in the big games! Might have a decent game against the lower level teams now and then! Spends most games walking around sulking 💯 ⚽️
Sad thing is, if United had Haaland they wouldn't have the style to feed him. Who were the last counter attacking team to win the prem  ?
Football is a cult you have been brainwashed, this sport is evil. Billionaire are milking your money, and not even building a homeless shelter in the city the club is based. YOU SUPPORT THEM, BUT DO THEY SUPPORT YOU. YOU GET NOTHING WIN OR LOSE. IT DOESN'T MATTER
Haaland’s dad really did lose the battle but won the war hahahahahaha
Slipped up there Roy..white players eh lol
Let's not forget pep has had his influence over his team for years and has his dna stamped in it , now he's fine tuning it with the likes of haland etc ...give the utd manager chance to do the same ...a man city four years ago wouldn't of won 6-3
Sweet revenge for his dad Mr Keane. 'Nuff said.😂😂😂😂
Annual Roy Keane post game reaction at the Etihad👌
Just waiting for Gary Neville blaming the Glazers Bus...any time soon now...that bus is never late after humiliating defeats.🙄
No doubting this city teams quality but we gave them far too much respect, it’s a derby, get into them ffs. Gang of cowards
The worrying thing is that ten Hag sees these players in training and he really thought Mctominay starting ahead of casimero was a good idea. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
City will win this league post xmas easily. Will win it by a record amount of points and record goals scored.  No other team will live with them.  Haaland will score more than 70 league goals and set new records.  Not worth subscribing to sky sports really!😄😅😄😅
Look its not like there a the team of the 90s
Man city where unplayable and haaland,what can you say,boys diffrent gravy
Personally I think man utd have made huge improvements in this game. To lose 6-3 is good for them. Hope they offer ten hag a lifetime contract.
As a Liverpool fan you can't be a hater this season City have upped there level to some next ridiculous level. Klopp needs to focus on getting top 4. Must be good being a city fan knowing If you go 2 3 goals down you still win or worse case draw. Arsenal bless erm will fade out soon
Well,we all listen to Mr Keane! When he played,he had a safety net! He ran away from Vinnie Jones ,on/off the pitch! You know it's true lad!!
I don't think you can use the word embarrassed. Utd, a top 7 side lost by 3 goals to the best team in the world. No different to Barcelona beating Valencia 6-3, yet that wouldnt even get a mention
Whatever happened to Lisandro Martinez who was all the rage a few weeks ago.  Isn't He still a Beast? 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭🙆‍♂️
Roy is soooo negative!! Antony’s goal was exquisite! Martial’s penalty unsaveable! Second half win 3-2! Come on Roy!! Silver linings! 🤣
I think man utd played very very poor at the same time mancity were just clinical.  Non existent midfield and no support from forwards and let back 4 & Degea just completely masacared. Absolutr carnage.
that man united team needs a manager like roy who wont take any crap to kick them up the backside
Most player's really lack motivation and fighting spirit especially Bruno...he should be benched too
Haland is out for blood thanks to Keane lol anyone to blame its him for what he done to halands dad
As a neutral it is very pleasing to see that United are now at such a poor level. It will happen to City too at some stage.
23 hour gang
I’m no manager but if ETH played Casemiro alongside Mctominay, took out Bruno to play Eriksen/Fred in his position & started Martial upfront, we would’ve seen something different.
The one word I would use is "pure quality".
still waiting for Roy to say something positive on Haalland, that is soooooo hard for him to handle, that his enemy-son is one of the best players in the world 😂😂🤣🤣 i can see it in hius face EEEEVERYTIME they mention Haaland, he twitches almost 😂😂🤣🤣
I am glad for Pep he knows his football 🧐⚽🥶
Utd are far better than last year. They beat liverpool.  They were never going to beat city away.
man uni-lol
Our first real match in almost a month and it’s a slaughter.   I like to think this is just a throw away game and we can get back to the ball we were playing really well back in August but this is disturbing. We must play better and we have to utilize our top players (RONALDO!!!!) BETTER!!!
Why they are spending money with Machins like(Ronaldo, casemiro) if they dont wanna use.???
Lol now that pogba is gone who they gonna blame😂
Man united are not competing for the title, so this loss doesn't matter. They are simply competing for place 4 (champions league).
Ironic when the son of the guy Keane crippled puts 3 past a hapless man u...keep it up Haaland!
The game was lost in midfield...
Roy Kent
thats the difference in level between ucl team and europa league team
Lol. Who doesn't like the truth and especially from someone who knows what they're talking about. Roy should be given the Man Utd job for sure. At least he'd install some pride in performance in those multimillionair players.
Man u lost 6 tree
As man united fan I feel bad for supporting a club with new hopes in each season and the same results repeating each and every season
Shambles, imposters, frauds
Queen Kelly, king Roy, prince andrew
Brighton play better football than utd
Manchester United lost 6-3 to a well organized, strong team, that's been dominating England for years, at their own ground in front of their fans, with the best striker in football right now, it's not a bad thing, United have already beaten Liverpool and Arsenal while they are still on the process of building a team, i don't understand why people are surprised of this loss, yes they were mistakes made by  Then Haag but English pundits love to talk too much and put pressure on teams and players , if they spoke more subjectively and logically, this post match analysis would be much more instructive football wise,  Just look to what they did to Arteta even thou he won the FA cup on his first season, and look at him now after the hard work and dedication he has put on the squad of Arsenal
The special always have solution to a squad like man city. Adopt or you die....man u didn't adopt but wanted to play all out....
They've been broken since fergie left. 500 million of rubbish
Well you can't blame Ronaldo and Maguire for this one
From a LFC fan nothing to be embarrassed about United and every other team in the league are going against a state owned team. Basically a team on financial turbo charge. But I give it to Pep and management for being able to organise and tactically implement their cash flow by buying the right players who do work for them. Its not a PSG debacle of primadonnas.
Yeah but it's funny tho 🤣
Micah Richards trying to be serious pundit
😡
Probably the best sleep Maguire ever had last night.
It would have been a cricket score if hopeless harry had played
U ended his dad career
Sir Alex would be spinning in his grave
Man city bought best and energetic players as the club belongs to billionaire who buys players chosen by the coach  It should not be forgotten the best Norwegian strikers was supposed to come to MUTD but didn’t happen  MUTD players did their best and the coach is brave should not blamed  . MUTD fans should watch and support their club to the end like Liverpool fans We long time if more strollers are added we bright feature ahead
I love this game 😉
Would love to see someone man-marker KVB.
How can you start McTom ahead of Casemiro? 😮 It's embarrassing.
No shame getting battered by city they’ll do the same to us soon
Good job he did or it would have been 10 !!
Change coaches don’t help something is totally wrong with United the last 2 years new players don’t help as well
let's not foprget here that City were without their 1st choice Central Defence pairing and their go-to midfielder Rodri!! And they battered UTD! Pep had the luxury of taking 4 players off and resting them half way through the second half ffs. And City could/should have had more than 6. It will be evry interesting to see what TenHaag does after this.
The main difference between the two teams is that Man Utd don't have a single player good enough to mop the changing room of our under 14's.
This man is Savage 😉
Roy, why are you surprised with the result? I'm LFC fan but making it more difficult and criticizing players and the club all the time doesn't help, does it? Everyone must have forgotten it's Man City and they are years ahead of changes Man Utd is going through right now. Man City will destroy every team this season in the Premier League and I wouldn't be surprised if LFC is losing 4:0 20min into a game against Man City because we are disastrous defensively this season. It is very easy to have a go at the players, the manager or the entire club when the results are not there but it takes a lot of hard work, courage and commitment to turn things around. Put the emotions aside and support, be positive. All the best to everyone!!!
McTominay is a great rugby tackler.
I think sky should not let ex players commentate or analyse teams they played for. No one wants to hear a full man basically crying because his team lost.
Pick 11 players from Saturday or Sunday league...get them fit & they would do better than this lot....donate their wages to kids hospitals in the area....they were a disgrace AGAIN.
ETH was too naive with his team selection. When he choose McTominay & Eriksen in midfield he already lost the game. McTominay had few good games but how can you start him over Casemiro and Eriksen can pick passes againts lesser teams but he isn’t on KDB’s level and he was outclassed today. It should’ve been Case/Fred partnership in the middle of the park giving that solidness.
"They must have got used to it" killed me 🤣🤣🤣
Many current rules annoy me, but the one that frustrates me most, is a player going off when injured, just to come back on again. Look at Varane yesterday. I blame the player a bit in that instance. The ball ended up going out for a corner, which City scored from, and the tallest defender for Utd had been able to walk off, before coming back on after the goal had been scored. I understand he was injured, but no one can tell me that the fella couldn't have stood in the box or on the line at least, until the corner was taken, then gone down for treatment after as the danger was cleared or the ball went dead. Instead, what pees me right off, is they brought the trainer on, the guy hobbles off and stands and watches as City head it in from the resulting corner.
I think we've all been waiting for this😂
Blame pogba blame ronaldo blame rashford none of them Played and you lot still will get spanked on 😊
Ten hag has to take his fair share of criticism .. opting for mctomnay over casemiro was a brutal mistake
Short Lopez vs giant haaland, that was not so clever
Roy is being kind - we were utterly inept and useless
Antony and Sancho what happened to you. £160m right there. Great value for money.
I thought Martinez was the best apparently 🤔
need to rid of whole group of manunited players bring in new youths leave a  few rid of rest terrible why is ronaldo on bench
Man City , are easily the greatest ever premier league team. not a club in the history has been this good consistently.
City are on another level at least United showed some level of fight
Ten Hag thought he was still in the Eredivisie  after being named coach of the month lol.
City sign Haarland Utd sign Eriksson..... It's that simple.
Thats what you get for not buying Haaland so Man City doesnt have him.
Liverpool need to back in form they only club can stop man,city
This game made me laugh.
With the ball, no one touches city and their level. You can't expect to disturb them by giving city the game they want. Either you counterattack and be strong centrally, or you go full Bielsa and hunt for every inch at every second.
Keano speaks fact
it's always man u under performing. one day people will wake up and accept that they aren't actually that good anymore
Ten hag is too know , is obvious casimero should be playing
I predicted that Keane would have a hard time watching this match. I'm so pleased to predict Haalands hat trick. And it was also pleasing to know that his dad was in the stands watching.   Revenge served and delivered.
nice
Got to give the half a dozen United fans who stayed until the end a bit of credit though  .....
we won 3-2 second half 🫡
Lol, the butcher of Amsterdam got well and truly slaughtered ..... Ten Hag clueless and unable to stop the rout ..... Fergie looking demoralised as though he was being forced to watch a re-run of a 50 year old coronation street episode!
If you’re going to start with McT, you may as well add Casimero to mop up the sloppiness.
Keane still ranting. I swear I can hear a hoover in the background 🤣
City's bench 2 strong  Well done city's wallet
United baldie thought only just by pressing you can win games. 😂😂😂
Man Utd players just not as good as city players and they need to have the sort of money investment that city have got and a winning atmosphere brought back . But Harland can punish the best teams he just seems like a goal machine and with players like phoden and de Browne 😮
Before I sound insane, I want to preface this with saying; I think Man City are a very good team and I always thought that they'd win this fixture....but....United felt like they were building something, players like McTominay were looking in good form, every player that was being picked were contributing in some good overall performances  -  then no games for what felt like an age appeared to have taken some wind out of their sails and it showed with some absolute rubbish on the field.  Just at the risk of stating the painfully obvious.....Haaland is one hell of a Striker, and City look like they could win everything.
I dunno l think keane living in man us glory days when they richest club in league and could buy any player they wanted...now other teams can compete they have real competition...they need to wake up and train hard and have a desire to win now if they want success...they cant just turn up abd think as they manu they should win...the premiete league has gone to anothet level this season..even nforrest wrnt on a buying spree..alot tougher now.
Oh here we go again
The players should not  be EMBARRASSED, they did what they could do , it MAN CITY that is all. the good part is we score 3 on man city😁
Ten Hag isn't Smart that much , the only tactic he has is every united player send to midfielder and they sent the ball to trashford then pray God that he accidentally score goal , they totally forget about head from free kick and other because ten Hag hate Ronaldo to play
Rashford, sancho and bruno need to look at themselves in the mirror, they are they attacking player that need to make a threat but what they do is losing the ball and too slow.
Don't be embarrassed by being taken apart by city.Its just a reminder of the gulf in Manchester and that after utd matching city for spending. 😳
We knew it was only a matter of time before Keane was ripping Utd. again 😂
Mistake was: the formation, starting line up, and lack of motivation.  MU could have done better
thank for for the ear buzzing sky. much appreciated it.
This City team's attacking prowess imo makes them the best in Europe now.
The obsession with mctimony needs to stop there is quality to  reach at  and today proved it
Rashford was a ghost and the only time we saw penandes was when he was  moaning at the ref
Man utd players should watch this .. This is shameless amd disgrace to Ronaldo.😥
United can’t even string 3 passes together. So you have a club like that trying to play against quality like De Bruyne, Haaland, Foden, etc. Like adults playing against 3rd graders.
Mertough Maddness
Why is Scott Mctominay even playing for us? Rashford was sloppy, Mctominay is sloppy, many others wee sloppy.
Kudos for Pep telling his players to take it easy after the 6th goal what sportmanship
United should have played Sancho ffs
Haaland is taking revenge for what you did to his father f.. Roy 😏
Ten Hag following the Ole tactical plan. I have no idea what he tried. He won’t last beyond two years…
Get me on Haaland, he won’t see the ball 👊🏼
man united are like a woman on menopause,they should just accept that their glory days are long gone 😂😆
Men v Boys
Only Maguire would have stopped Manchester City with no look defence..
Man City is not a joke this season Holland is taking the future It's okay
Manchester United defence is learning Maguire skills..
Man United boys are very frustrated now,  they have to dig deep to gain their confidence again.
After beating a disastrous Liverpool and Arsenal, there was already talk that United were going to fight for the league😃...back to reality... but it was a beautiful dream 😂
I dont think i want to watch man u live again. Its heartwrenching.
That's the monster you created, Mr Keane. Now suffer his wrath 😂
Is that Micah laughing at 39s 😂
Did Casemiro Ronaldo or anyone come to United to win titles? no, they came for the paycheck. thats the difference between two teams here. dont see how United expect to win these games when their aims are so low.
As a United fan, I feel the break has really had a toll on the players. The venom on the part of the players of Man U would have been better than this. Anyways City is too hot at the moment. Only Barca and Madrid, maybe PSG can play them at the moment. Such pure class City players.
United same ol story. Its not Ole or anybody fault. its the club
I can only think TenHag got overconfident going into this one. If ever there was a game to play Casemeiro and McTominay in front of the back 4 it was this one. Then have Eriksen in front of them to try and pick out 3 fast forwards on the counter. Instead he thought he had the players to take City on.  Big mistake.
Can we get Keane and Scholes back for a year?
They keep on playing Erikson in a DCM role, he can't play their against top teams. Second McTominay is not consistent enough and the rest just didn't turn up really like they couldn't get going!
I'm bit dissapointed but United brings the force and make it 6 - 3  What a game, respect both team 👏👏
Man city pass GG
Once again the wannabe elite manager leprechaun at it again… Embarrassed isn’t the emotion here It’s about belief Many of these players according to Keane should have been embarrassed 4628 times in last 5 seasons Give it a rest mate! Martial needs time as he’s the future like it or not! And that’s over Ronaldo It’s not going to get Ugly with Ronaldo IT IS…and the boss thinks it best to mitigate that by keeping him down pecking order!!
Why rashford was not sold by now....no belief just standing ball watching no pressing if that was the case Ronaldo should be used   And what is Ten Hag thinking defending with incapable attack minded slow midfielders
You have to accept united era of dominance is over. They are now mid table team
BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Should have put casemiro instead of eriksen. Eriksen is not strong enough to defense again haaland
Ha.......makes me laugh when they talk about progress. Liverpool and Arsenal were all over United and United won on counter attacks and were very lucky to win. Real Sociedad beat them in Europe. All they're good at is beating the little teams and giving themselves false hope that they're somebody.
I absolutely enjoyed city smash that over priced team (utd)..they are an embarrassing team 😂
The difference is, this united team did at least rally to score 3 goals, instead of folding
Man Untd all are sloppy..no fighting spirit....even after 4-0 still running like a fashion show! Also playing only half of the field back n forth, not trying to press, no tactic in the opponent box and eventually loss the ball.....sloppy sloppy.... Even though they won the previous 4 matches, but always the opponent are playing better in every match.....fed up!
Keane = agree
Stop crying Roy you lost to us fair and square 😂😂 stop crying
imagine Cole palmer didn't come on 🤦🏾‍♂️it would've ended 8-1
I wish when Haaland was interviewed after the game he’d said to Roy “my dad says Hi 👋🏻 “  🤣🤣🤣
Ten hag is no manager , you don’t leave one of the best players of all times in the bench and still doesn’t get it.
Now you also cannot blame CR7 for not pressing.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man Utd’s best goal scorer is made to stay on the bench even after management refused to sell him. Disgraceful! Maguire is still playing. Why!?! Plus, there’s some players earning a fortune on long contracts who are cruising.
this guy talks alot but never played an opposition this good in his career let's be real.  in today's game he would be another Scott mctomney
Ten Hag was over his head, Man Utd were decent last couple of weeks, but to play Eriksen and Bruno at the same time against a freakin Man City is suicide, you have a freakin Casemiro, the best defensive midfielder in the world last few years, and put him in the bench ? it's just ridiculous.
Why is she on the panel she knows nothing
Look city completely outclassed us but in our defence, Varane was injured for the 2nd and 3rd goals if city played fair they would’ve kicked it out for us, also Haaland and foden’s 3rd’s were both close margins defo goals but close and that malacia clearance on the line was unlucky and no team has scored 3 goals on city this season apart from us (and Liverpool community shield idk if it counts) united had 46% Possesion and 12 shots to city’s 54% and 22 shots which is a big difference but considering where we are at in ten hags rebuild this was sadly more competitive than most Manchester derby’s certainly since 2020 and even then since Guardiola has taken over it’s been rare for us to beat city so I wouldn’t be too down untied fans because we were there just not at the same table as city who have a world class squad and are completing their project whilst we are starting ours ten Hag showed with better players we could compete in games like this and Liverpool and Arsenal etc our win percentage against big 6 is still 66% which is way better than last season
Tbh, even the 3 goals they scored didn't happen because they "broke City's defense" or showed heart...it was mostly because City themselves always make mistakes when they are winning in a dominant form. This samething happened with Real Madrid. They are winning & dominating the game so they get so lazy. That first goal from Antony happened cause Grealish didn't even try to fight for that ball like he was doing all game. Everyone just moved out the way to let him shoot. That 2nd goal was just lazy defending from akanji & cancelo, it's like they were confident that United was going to mess up on their own and ended up paying for it. And that penalty was just a stupid & unnecessary challenge from cancelo. If City learns to play the full 90mins like its 0-0, they wouldnt be conceding as much.
Shouldn't have fouled his dad like that
Roy Keane angry cause Haaland walked off the pitch😡
just came here to say i cannot believe people sit and listen to a 4min vid of roy keanes opinions. i have no faith in the world today
You know why I’m so angry at those utd players? Because they were scared!!! And that’s unforgivable
We’ve had success since the 50’s, so has liverpool
Full on corruption
City were bought, Newcastle were bought.. eventually every time will be competing for the title
Keane should've played... Might have ended another haalands career 😂
Its not fair you see. All other EPL teams played centre backs above 6 ft
Whatever u think bout Utd u gotta love Keane; he certainly don't hold back on how he really feels. *How many £70-80 mill players have Utd got an their STILL struggling? Are they just lazy or is it the gaffer, formation, tactics,confidence or cohesion etc?*
I actually think, considering how low Man U’s standards are, scoring three goals and only losing by a three goal margin is a good result 😂
Such a pussyboy sport.
To be fair, City would have scored 6 or more goals against any team today. Just an amazing side in their groove
I think it's really "a tale of two clubs" here. There's reason to be angry and gutted as a United fan, but this really is what happens when one club is running at their peak from the owner down to the kitman, and the other is Man United.   It shows a gulf not just in the two 11's, but the two 25's, two academies, technical directors, CEOs, recruitment teams, maybe even two managers - though that remains to be seen.  We are witnessing one club build the kind of dynasty that Man United built in the 1990s in England - only that team is Man City, the worst possible team you'd want. United looked out of their depth as a team and as a club today. It's a long road to redemption but there's about 9 games this month and they're not against Man City. They need to dunk their heads into an ice bath, get back right to work and set about winning all of them games.
Forget the football what is going on with Micah Richards glasses 🤓
Tbh they look shook I don’t know if it was a sense of arrogance from united going into the game trying to treat it like city aren’t years ahead in terms of progress than us wingers not following back enough sloppy passes the midfielders not even being in the picture when city are on the edge of the box 😂😂😂if we can’t beat them with quality the least we can do is try to work harder than them but we can’t even do that embarrassing I get we are still rebuilding but there’s no excuse for lack of effort it’s a disrespect to the fans
Different world. MU transfer market is very bad. They lose haaland. Wish they spent 100M on haaland.
The coach should get sacked for starting Ronaldo on the bench
That guy on the right looks like he needs a new suit. Its stretching like its gonna break.
Erik Tan Haag should just start Maguire. Easily can divert all blames.
Man utd net debt 620m 😂😂😂😂😂😂
i am sure united would make it 6-6 if there were 10 mins additional time from the ref
What should also be said since they call us the most toxic fanbase is were not mad they lost. Were mad they didnt even bother to show up and compete. Theres no dishonor in defeat had they put up a show or fight but they didnt. Ive been saying Sancho is a flop and we see why Pep didnt sign him. As good as Malacoa and Dalot had been prior, with no defensive help on the midfield they had zero chance at play as the entire defensive line was getting work by half the City team. Rashford was absent as usual. And it should also be noted we gave then a clean slate. We even said we understood and sympatized with them when a few of them started coming out in interviews saying they were forced to play injured. But what now? Rashford was absent yet again. Put Ronaldo in there. Yes hes showing signs od declining but nobody bleeds red devil blood like him. No one has his damn passion to win even when the goals keep coming hes always telling the team one is all they need to start the comeback just one. Bruno doesnt lead like this. Antony was completely absent in the first half. Put Ronaldo back in let the man that gave United so many memories sink with the ship if thats what he wants. Nobody else is doing anything let Ronaldo go out on his shield this last year.
The money Utd have spent! Jeez it's ridiculous
Apart from City is far ahead of MU but the reality was that Ten Haag got it totally wrong.
The white players, ?? What is keane on about
To be fair , any team would have been slapped around with that performance. 🤔 Doesn't make anything he said less true though.
The myth says martinez is going to pocket haaland🤣 Haaland turned The Chopper into Chicken Chop for his dinner
The players are just not good enough to be playing at the top level
popcorn time
No leader ship Ronaldo was on the bench duh
When they beat Arseanal ,I said we dominate the game and MU play fossil football their fan don't believe.    Keep play like that,you will get beaten again.
Man utd need Bellingham in that midfield and osimhen up front and oblak to replace de gea
Dunt blame on ETH, whats a lesson learned,  he knows he cant put bruno n eriksen together against MC
Whenever Micah talks I skip forward til Keane begins to talk. The guy just wants to be different and controversial.
Was even Rashford on field today 😂😁...i like this man but one of his poor performance today..including McTominay,Bruno...ETH needs lot of work to do to get back..i feel bad that Man U were humiliated in front of Sir Alex Ferguson...
Imagine Keane talking about football, dude has no clue
Ten Hag should have sent the MU Women’s team instead..then all is well 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Keane should regret what he did to Alfie.. It transfered the greatness of MU to City.. 😆😆😆😆
Will halland win what Keane has won in England.He played City 14 times and won 10 with 4 draws.
Would have started Casimero, McThominay/Fred holding down Kevin anywhere and Eriksen behind the number 9
Kelly Dalglish is deadly best in the business 👏
Not much excuse for Man U playing like this. Been a supporter since the 80s . We sucked so bad we should have Hoover for a sponsor.
What united still missed is a leader on the field. Someone that fuels these players, there is no stand out player with that attitude so far. We are getting talents but we r missing that someone that brings cohesion.
Lets take a step back here and remember where United were just a few months ago. Pep struggled in his first season as well. City is the best team in Europe at the moment. Eric needs time, this to me is not a bad result but a good experience.
The game was also subliminal  revenge against Roy Keane between Haaland and his dad and also the supporters of city. Think about it
Keane is an objective reporter-RUBBISH
Keane- you look silly with all the hair on your face-silly billy and no one can see you- hiding and kicking again-
Whos looking after little roy Richard’s tonight?
You ended the father's career now the son came to end your club so this is partly your fault lmao 🤣
Roy Keane knows ball
Scathing about the modern generation Roy Keane is the best Roy Keane
Sancho and Anthony are overrated
Don't overreacted with this MU squad.. This is squad on a rebuilding process
Is that a car alarm in the background?It is Manchester though😄
Manu are terrible and have done Ronaldo dirty
"This is Manchester United"
Jeez anyone else wearing earphones/headphones hear the high pitch ringing on these interviews! Jeez!
United's defending was so lazy and Maguire wasn't even on the pitch to score his own hattrick
You have to laugh don't ya. people like roy keane in a studio and man united so afraid of Ferguson he was not tapped up for assistant manager. But there was room for McClaren 😂
Yeah it was men  v. Boys out there they played us off the park I don't think anyone will stop them this season not in premier or Europe there another level with the big man up top  him and Foden different class today
got to say those subtitles compared to what Roy is actually saying is hilarious
Should úe Ronaldo ten har :)) u so stupid
Why is Micha dressed like an early 2000 RnB singer?
When are these United managers going to realise mctominey is nowhere near what’s needed. Casamero on the bench is a sin not to mention rashford starting ahead of ronaldo
why casimero didnt start will never make sense
Those balls in behind is something Pep has picked up from Madrid and now they've got a weapon to run onto them. Dangerous for the rest of the league and europe.
Mc just too strong
KEEEAAAANOOOO
*ALFIE'S REVENGE*
The players are not good enough.  That's the reason. Doesn't matter how much you run around, try playing a level above.
Haaland Haaland 😂😂😂😂
Weakest mentality in the league. Deck Chair FC.
Two goals plenty of leniency by Christian Eriksen.
Roy looks like he’s in his last 10 years….
city are on another level.. HAALAND.. 🔥🔥🔥☝️.. 💙💙💙
Roy Keane should've gone for Alfie haalands balls
Tell them Keano !!! 🫵
Roy please tell MUn you want to be the manager.
Only team who’s game Man City a game this season is Newcastle lol
Set back??? Who thought we was going to win. Roy mental
I've been trying to beat City in video game league for 2 weeks I lost I think 7 times, I even couldn't draw with them and today they looked better and harder than the video game, Manchester United is not bad but Manchester City is playing a different level from a different world
Man U Lost 4-0 first half Man U Won 3-2 second half Man City were still at a completely different level.
6-3 isn’t really a battering tho 😂
Man utd shouldnt ashame, coz utd never at city's level from the kickoff 😩
Man what's all the hate. No1 expected utd to work this game....
300 thousand plus a week as if they care
Keano is right. it was embarrassing for us but nothing to take from it? those 3 goals were ok. we still scored 3 goals on them
Has been believing more why strikers couldn’t score , but after reviewing more and roye Keane team time back. There should be more responsibility on defence and midfielder as well…
I blame Maguire
Need 2 spend another 100 million...lol...
Season in season out. Shameless man utd keep loosing against mancity.  They are a disgrace to football
If City kept going at full force it would have been 10-12 nil UTD Lucky city slowed down because the game was won
In a team full of absolute quality, KDB is a shining diamond.
Roy Keane about this M. City *"are one of the best teams I've ever seen..."* 💪💪💪
Embarrassing UTD
haaland gets all the plaudits but kdb is the gem in that team and the best player in the world
it's a decade of being soft.  heee heee
Imagine Roy Keane in that dressing room. I genuinely think he needs to be brought in as Assistant Manager. Them players are all a bunch of saps, more concerned with their socials, journalists and wages than putting in a shift on the pitch. It’s sickening. Did Man City even get out of 2nd gear during the match?
Maguire having a sigh of relief that he was warming the seat.
"Hello. My name is Erling Haaland. You killed my father's career. Prepare to cry."
Conclusion: Pogba was the biggest EPL flop ever
blame arsenal roy..
ETH formation mistake and 3 player don't given  💯 Manchester United play like training in ground
Manchester 'we're back' United 😂
Cr7 has not been at his best but not playing is very very very stupid and very disrespectful, Cr7 has to leave United come January
Sware its neil Oliver
Honestly this why I don't like pundits if roy say this is sloppy like he has been a successful Couch come on now the season is not over
When Brentford won Man U. The coach made Man U players run. Now will they be told to run again 😂
Did Roy Keane just criticise the United players for giving Citeh time and space...only to go on and say 'pressing is the new buzz word !? Utter madness.
I think the game would have been quite different if Ten Hag had played Casemiro
Where was casemiro
Bruno fernandes is a disgrace.
Was that a Micah snigger @ 0:39 😆🤭
3 weeks ago Keane was like Ten Haag was the 2nd coming of Christ. At least they got the United back from start of season 😆😆😆
Roy keep saying the players should be embarrassed lol 😅.
Did Roy say "white players" what did he say/mean?
City was brilliant United was horrendous 😀
I feel sorry for Hag, managing Utd is a poisoned chalice. They should have stuck with Moyes when he was with them.
they will do this again too us at old trafford
The best team won
As much as it's fun to make fun of Man Utd, the difference between them Man City is paramount and this was to be expected.
You will not win big games with Fernandez and mctominy in midfield
This has already been clipped up for the ‘Keane’s angriest moments 2022/23’ compilation video coming at the end of the season 😅
Man City's football is out of this world. Fast paced forward and fast paced in recovery. As a united fan I admit we are years and years behind. Lots of work and better recruitment needed!!
Leaving Ronaldo on the bench?? Shocking from the manager, shocking.....
IT'S YOUR FAULT ROY, THE ONLY REASON THE NORWEGIAN KID CAME TO ENGLAND IS FOR REVENGE AND HE GOT IT
Least it wasn't 6 nil 😁😁
What was the little squeak Roy does at 1:39????
I can't see Micah losing his hair. Can you?
Who do you blame when you can't blame Maguire? McTominay I guess?
"GOD'S VACCINES" BY DR THOMAS JACKSON USA GREAT HEALTH WATCH YOU TUBE ENJOY BEAUTIFUL WATCH UNMISSABLE HEALTH WATCH ❤️🙏🏾❤️
Man city stopped trying hard at 4 lucky coz arsenal spurs never would
😂😂😂pep substitute his best players as soon as second half starts 😂😂he taught Casimero was going to come in ,he doesn't want to risk losing all his best players injured
Ten Hag is out of his depth
Fair play to Roy, he's not wrong.
Actually starting to like Roy Keane tbh , always thought he was harsh but he tells the truth tho 🤔
Shocking
Haalands dad did not play 90mins again after Keane deliberately assaulted him on the pitch. He should have done jail time.
they was slow
Hahhaa roy keane was acting a punk when United beat Arsenal acting like they had won the league 🤣
City 2nd goal was scored when varane was off the pitch and 3rd goal was shortly after he was back on clearly still in pain I think that was where the game really ended maybe if that hadn’t happened it would’ve been 4-3 or even 3-2
I blame Paul Pogdog
Halaand is a criminal   Lock him Up 😆
Ronaldo and Casemiro should have started this
Reality strikes..
WHAT is wrong with United?? If you cant find the motivation for a Man derby...They were off from the first minute!
City have this league bought I don’t expect lfc to do any better unfortunately I feel this season every team will roll over to them ( apart from nufc)
I think British would be but foreigners no chance ,no loyalty in that team
Id say Keane & Utd fans regret that tackle now 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
0:39 that gasp of air though, hes definitely holding back.
Royd boring
Lol music to my ears to hear losers united crying. They have the best CDM on the world but the guardiolla wannabe manager prefer Mctominay, they have Ronaldo who scored 18 goals for them, unmatchable in aerial, a threat to the opponent just by his presence but Eric ten times overhyped prefer rashford whos work rate less than cr7 with less ability. Man united would bench Benzema and lewandoski and KDB if they had them. Suck it and accept your failure losers
Keen is harsh on Man United, if Haaland wasn’t playing, the score could have been 3:3, let’s just admit, Manchester City is just too good.
On the positive side for United, it was another consistent performance from Slabhead.
The fans leaving at 4-0 are an embarrassment.  Support your team !!
Huh?! Did I just hear Roy Keane PRAISING City?! 🤣
Man Utd R.I.P.
Don’t worry champions league is here city will flop
... this is Man United
Cant believe they ever compared bruno Fernandez and de bruyn 😂...what a joke
Am starting to hate this Keane guy ...we all knew that city is far beta than united...they lost and we knew they will lose united is not good right now..give them time stop  the criticism becoz u played for the club..
Embarrassing performance by Manchester City. They couldn't keep a 4 goal lead at home from an awful team like Manchester United. Honestly City fans. What chance do you have against Real Madrid... Absolutely none at all. 3 goals conceded at home 😂
who is that guy next to Keane and why does he talk?
I get that Ten Hag didn't want to upset the dressing room by dropping McTominay because he had a few decent performances, but Casemiro should have been integrated into the team straight away and ready and firing by the time this match came around. Poor decision by the Manager, I hope he learns the lesson quickly.
Everybody Has a Plan Until They Get Punched in the Mouth
When I see Roy Keane and Man United I click.
😂
'Everyone's got a plan until they get punched in the face' Mike Tyson / Erik Ten Hag
Casemiro is a key player in Real Madrid and a reserve in Manchester United hhhhh . We told you that the problem is the coach. I hope that Ronaldo will leave this failed team and the failed coach...
They maybe getting used to it 😭😭😭
These are full-time global elite millionaire players? Serious?
Halaand's revenge 😂 Keane
Much ado about nothing!
Richards must be trying so hard to not crack up..😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅 ‘Plus Roy Keane must’ve knew this deep down.’ And wanted to join in and have a good laugh to…😆
Class team versus prima donna
Sky sports editor can rest now
Maguire=Defensive Midfield
If you are defending against city you a losing, they are the best at unlocking defenses, you need to get at him make it ugly man to man marking and maul em with aggression and work rate.
this is for you, keane!
Foreign central here again🤣
Ten Haag is going to need more than a miracle to do anything with some of those United players...
United doest know the word EMBARRASSED, look at thhe amount of Super star they've sign and cant win a single trophy..
200 MILLION  spent you may aswell flush down the toilet
The difference in these two clubs is like chalk and cheese . For all those who said haaland would flop in the epl you should feel as embarrassed as United club is feeling today .
Man utd = 💩
How predictable is Roy Keane and his outbursts, I am surprised his equally terrible pundit mate Neville is not bleating.
Can't even call it a derby now can we
Manchester is blueeeeee
Should of started casamro for sancho and played 4 3 3 rather than 4 2 3 1. Got dominated
It is Pogba's fault!
I cant believe there are so many well paid football fools.Same set of DEFENDERS BEING SHUFFLED LIKE A DECK OF CARDS.SAME SET OF FANS THAT CANT SEE THE TEAMS WEAK LINKS.FOOL FOOL
City in 2nd gear all game
Keane deserved this
Martial should have start….but all de same we will never give up…mark it it shall be well….glazers should buy players Teg hag want
Something needs to be done. Manchester United need a lot of work to get back to their best.
Looks like there’s gonna be a new manager soon, don’t know what the management is doing
City are just delightful to watch, don’t support them, but their football is sublime.
As usual The master has spoken and the truth hurts … 100% correct ….. miles off the pace and decision making,… men against boys ??
Akanji had a great game he is enjoying to watch :) come on city best team style ever
No question City are much better.  But, again, zero effort from United. So, Ten Hag pays all this money for Casemiro to have him sit in the bench?
This was the problem: Man United three attackers were not in the game, and Bruno went up high too. That left Eriksen and McTominey alone against the entire Man City team..... that was never going to work.........   We should have played woth two attackers at the most, and Bruno should have been told to drop down and not play attacker, or be substituted. This setup gave 4 Man United players who were not part of the game (Rashford, Sancho, Anthony and Bruno).
They wouldn’t be if you didn’t injure haaland’s dad
“Defensively all over the shop” is killing me 😂😂😂
There was only one real problem with Zman United and it has been going on for too long. RUBBISH BALL CONTROL. Losing the possession easily so many times. When you have rubbish ball control, you couldn’t string passes against good sides thus how could you generate your attack to score goals.? It really begs an answer what did all these managers and coaching all these years do in addressing this issue. Based on the showing, they did NOTHING. All of them.
Maybe if Keanes boot was a foot or two higher haaland might not have been born and united would of drew 3-3
When they thought Bruno was on par with kdb lol lol
I'm afraid that Liverpool lost to Manutd.
I blame Roy Keane
Im a West Ham man,but I would love to see Roy in charge at United,i think he would shake them up,what i can see at united is a lack of passion and hunger,and a couple of the players just dont want to be there.
Such understanding between the city players. They just know where to play the ball into for haaland to score and also credits to haaland for such precise positioning . He’s proving everyone that good positioning gets you more goals than good finishing.
He probably enjoyed it more for his dad Roy. U did ruine his father's career
Just never turned up. Picking mctom and rashford as centre forward is madness. Casemiro sitting on the bench and martial who can actually hold the ball up and play would of been better than rashford. Rashford is only good coming on the last 20 mins or playing left wing. He's not a striker. And bruno plays to far forward. And mctom has no positional sense at all. Erikson got swamped. Never turned up. And got battered. Scary to think city won the league playing without haaland last year. Now they have him they could win big this season. What a playing. Woodward not signing him is the most criminal thing I've ever seen. Absolute balloon. The guy is just unbelievable. And he's so young and not even in his prime. 😑
bruno fernandes is not a captain he just speaks a lot
I understand why Micah Richards is on air allowed to give his opinions and I think it's fantastic for multiculturalism and diversity but I wish he was just reduced to one sentence as he lacks erudition and sagacity. Hats off though to Micah speaking in what must be a second language.
Wouldn’t like to be in the trenches with any of those united players and I kid you not I could put a Sunday team of amateurs together with more fight and belief than that   lot for 1% of the price it’s embarrassing
Micah put on the glasses and instantly became a wise sage
Can anyone else hear the high pitched studio sound - notice it on every sky video, if you can zone out it’s fine but it’s kind of annoying - thought worth a post!
Naw, Man City with Haaland just have too much firepower - there is no shame in losing to them.
Should have played Maguire, why the hell was he on the bench???
Not every week - Simon from inbetweeners
You’ve got to ask yourself where was Paul Pogba in all of this?
It was all Pogba's fault. Lol
i blame Maguire for this result.
Roy, my friend. They are just too good. It isn't about Man Utd, it's about that they would hammer 1970 Brasil team !!!
Roy , maybe if you hadn't ended his dad's career Haaland could be a red.
This is all Ronaldo’s fault!!!
"Everyone has a plan before the game'' until they get 6 put passed them....👍🏼
The new era: desperate Man United
United was finished after Fergie
Spot on, Keano.
Oh my. United didn't even have Maguire to blame for this. He is a joke, but since sir Alex left, united have been a joke. Hahahahahaahaa
City just let them score to keep the Glazers there😂
All this is pointless for Gardiola and Manchester city if they don't win the  Champions league he will never be remembered as  great Manager if he doesn't win the ultimate trophy
Where is Carragher? He vanished totally? Oh I get it....bad results for Liverpool...
Just when you think United’s midfield can’t get any worse 😂
OMG! Man City substituted both Haaland n Foden the moment they were leading 6-1!!! And then Man United then can put 2 goals back...Can u imagine if City keep both Haaland n Foden to play n nvr subtiitued them, what will e real result be!!?? 7-1 or 8-1!!?? What a big gap between City n United!!!
Man united over age and washed up players for huge money and wages and then they wonder why they lost. List is endless with Alexis Sanchez, schweinsteger, varane,Casemiro, Erikson,   Ronaldo. Then keeping players like Phil Jones, Fred, and maguire. Point is where is the youth and the fear that they will be punished and demoralized is the same thing happening with the more experienced players. Some players like mctominay and Dalot are not world class . They will be above average at best. Bring in good and young players in their prime like milinkovic savic, ruben neves, dumfries and two central defenders who are young fast and tall with good ball playing abilities.
Comes down to tactics, Rashford's pace was nullified easily by putting Akanji and Ake and thats it- our only chance of scoring went away just like that. They bossed the midfield without Rodri- Eriksen got found out. He's an attacking player, yes his football sense might let him play as a 6 but not against a team like city. Midfield gave no cover to the CBs, wingers gave no support to the fullbacks. Its time to realise that McTominay is just not good enough for United, period. No credit in bank whatsoever, he's gotta be benched. Substitutions should have been made in the first half itself so ETH has to take a big share of the blame here
Roy Keane has these rants about United about 5 times every season
Roy still think that Utd are certainties for top 4, your having a laugh.
Honestly how incredible is the story that haaland snr was hacked down by Roy, then now, the best striker in the world, his son, is at city and put the sword to united and is completely dominant. You couldn't make it up.
They got done by a "hive mind"
Ppl gonna talk about Haaland and Foden (deservingly so btw) but De Bryune is the key to this city team. He is SOOOO good it’s unfair. The best creative midfielder in the world right now imo   And I’m a United fan 😬
I can't blame the players, this is man city we are talking about
This guy knows only how to break legs 🤣
My two favourite things to watch is Steve Nicol hide and make excuses when Arsenal win and Roy Keane when United lose
Man U needs another coach!!!!!!!
I think ManUnited would have won the game if Roy Keene was in the game, kicking in some knees😂
Embarrassing as a United fan. Well played to City.
...outclassed...?
The name Haaland will haunt Keane for the rest of his life 😂😂
the defenders don't even try especially the first goal varane was focusing on haaland but forgot foden who is just as dangerous with his finishing.
Did you know that FIFA and PES :( , used to have an in game code ,to prevent players from simply pressing "X" all the way to a goal?  At pass 7 ,the player was programmed to have less ball control to the point of losing possession constantly. City play without that code ,whereas United seem to be obsessed with the "Y" pass, channel passes and third man runs.
Kane had a chance to join City last year. Now he will be 30 years next year and have zero chance of joining City. He has to push for a move to Bayern next year.
1st half Manchester City 4 - Manchester United 0 2nd half Manchester City 2 - Manchester United 3  I'll call that a draw
Keane should be embarassed himself...for inflicted a horrific injury to Haaland's father
A lot of players need to go.
Nobody talks about de gea..
Oh look what happens when you don't get lucky aka vs Arsenal and are exposed for the dog crap team you are lol Man u soon fighting spurs for finishing 10th spot
You missed Maguire Roy, 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can just hear Neville if he was there  “Micah Micah but Micah…..”
Smoking on that Man Utd. pack tonight😙💨lool
"The problem is, united haven't got a halaand in their team" - Paul Merson probably
Hats off to you Roy .as a Man Utd legend to say that its a pleasure to watch city is a real character of strength..!
Not sure what anybody expected , they was probably the best team in the world city before they signed haaland , now they've got haaland they'll be unstoppable and win everything,  he's a goal machine ,  united signed eriksen a guy that's suffered from heart problems and is nearly 40 🤣🤣
With all respect to Keane, I think he should shut up with the rant. The team is under transition. These legends ask the fans to belive in the process and inturn rant about the team.
crazy how the world works! Keane injured haalands dad as his united side always crushed city, fast forward 20+ years and his son is now crushing his united to pieces! mental! could say karma finally caught up to united and keane lol
Bantchester United at its finest 🤣🤣🤣🤣
it's Roy Keane's fault that today united lost. And all the present united players are better than him. nothing but a trash player
get steve bruce in
Keane injured Hallands daddy and we are paying for it😡
Kelly could improve her questions, she just repeated Keane and put it as another question
Roy Keane, still wishes it was 1999. So does Prince. He'd still be alive...and partying! 🥳
Absolutely crap atmosphere at a so-called “derby”.
Roy, City are just that much better than Utd at this time, it’s going to take a few seasons and a lot of work to get back to title contenders
Not good Manchester United lost the match
Man. Utd at least won the second half 2-3!!! LOL. CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!
You know man united is a joke of a squad when as a fifa player you haven't played as united for the past 7 years not name a player you would buy from united I haven't seen a player I'd support in 7 years idk I'd united are ever gonna bounce back tbh if I was united I'd go for players who need to prove themselves not elite players no more elite players we need dogs foaming in the mouth mates who ain't making 100,000 a week Edson Alvarez is that player we need to build the defense first uniteds defense has been trash since vidic left I recommend Sébastien Casares Uruguayan 23 years old and go get a winger from napoli they got loads 😉
Infact I blame Maguire, Pogba and Ronaldo 🙃
Kean Man U are not good enough they never give away nothing they could not stop the goal’s Man City subs gave Man U a chance only thing kean said rite
I love hearing Roy kean being brutally honest🤣 I wish my man united friends would listen to this guy and stop talking to me about man u past 🤣
Haaland destroy keane
sack the manager
this is what you get when a team is allowed to flounce FFP by threatening to tie the Lawyers up for 40 years after spending what they want as money is no object to try and make them look civilised to the outside world , Big up City one day you`ll all be very proud of yourselves following these owners as they will destroy are leagues
This one is for you Roy asshole Keane
I hope haalands dad messaged Keane with a middle finger emoji
It could of been 10 easy
Scouting at Manchester United is Horrendous. They were lucky to get rid of Sanchez to then replace him with Sancho. How on earth Jadon Sancho commanded £73 million in transfer fee and £375k a week wages is even worse value than the Alexis Sanchez Deal. Sancho is nowhere near that level in ability to justify that level of remuneration. He's so slow for a winder. United need to find a way to get him off the wage bill ASAP. Maybe a deal to take him back to Dortmund. He's not just not a Manchester United player. West Brom, yes. Stoke City, yes. Manchester United No.
1. I think Ten Hag Made a huge mistake starting Erickson alongside Fernandez, Erickson should have been on the bench, he can't press, he's not fit for breaking up Man City midfield, Casemiro & Mctominay would have been better.  He underestimated City's midfield, And he paid the price for it. 2. Why start RASHFORD if Martial is fit, RASHFORD isn't good at holding up play, he barely dribbles or go past any defender, starting MARTIAL would have changed the dynamic of the city defense going forward, He's quick with turns and have better link  up plays than RASHFORD. 3. Sancho, Sancho, Sancho, he doesn't track back like Antony to help in defense which exposed Malacia a whole lot.
When you notice this is all karma from keane kicking haaland sr
Man united one of the biggest clubs in the world ??? Yeah right !!!  Without the ball yes !
in these games you need casemiro and fred/Scott with fernandes not eriksen
The coach got the tactics wrong not the player
"You have to break Haaland's legs like i did" ~ Keane
Imagine being Alex Ferguson. 30 years of pure graft making Manchester United the biggest club in the world during his hay day and watching them get thrashed by a team that had just been relegated from the premier league 20 years ago.
Hilarious.
I love this club💙
Erik should be sacked for going 4-0 down in the second half again. Not good enough from Man Utd.
I'd pay money if he had a go at Maguire for the crack..  "I mean maguire..embarrasing"
What does this sore loser have to say?
I think united just got outplayed. I wouldnt let it defeat them
Embarrassed to lose to this city? I dont think so, this aint brentford, they are literally a record breaking team. We should have been tighter and up for it, we weren't and they did what they do to most teams. You can analyse this game all you want but the fact of the matter is that United is nowhere near City's level and thats that. Add to that Haaland and Kdb on unreal form and you get this result. It could have been 3-1 would it make any difference? No.  United has a long way to go to match to teams like City that are exceptionally drilled and perform like a unit. Forget this match it was very unlikely this would ever going to be a derby, we need to focus on our weaknesses and improve. Even as a MU fan you cant deny the brilliance of Haaland and Kdb they are doing mad stuff, and Pep obviously has given them the perfect tools to do that.
same thing every year from keane
As Mike Tyson once said, 'everyone has a plan until you get punched in the face '
Being an arsenal fan…i just cant imagine our defenders facing haaland… damn thats so scary but i think we need to stop the supply first which de bruyne ..if you do stop i guess you can avoid half of the goals that utd conceded today…overall city just sat and relaxed …can someone just give halland the golden boot already…for god sake ..man is a nightmare
The first player in premier league history to score a hat-trick in three successive home matches take a bow haaland 💪💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥
The first player in premier league history to score a hat-trick in three successive home matches take a bow haaland 💪💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥
£70 million on Casemiro, starts on the bench in United biggest game of the season. MoNeY WeLL SpEnT 🤡😂
Its your fault roy.... you didnt finish the job with Haaland!
It was clearly Men vs Boys .
Rashford winning the player of the month award is the biggest joke of all. Was it a choice between him and Maguire?????
Oh so Kean embarrased again after being so proud after winning against the Gunners. Crazy 🎉😅
Karma roy, karma
Noway these Utd players deserve the wages their on.
Halaand Halaand!
CITY, CITY, The best team in north west and all the world ! (1958 movie theme tune of "The Vikings" sung loudly by the City faithfull in 1976 at Norwich away after the movies premier tv debut) 😝😄😛🤣💙👍CTID..
getting fed up of hearng about united
We gave them too much space but we shouldn’t forget where we were last season. It’s a work in progress. They surrounded Antony immediately he got the ball but we allowed Foden, Haaland in the box with no one near them. That was bad tactically!!
Haland will go the best club in the world Real Madrid in maybe next year
Man United Fans ...... Ronaldo is the problem .... hahahaha jokers Manchester is Blue ;)
Not surprised.
Roy Keane is absolutely right
Is Bobby Charlton still around.....?
We still need another 10 players b4 we can even compete against city
Man U are an embarrassment …… I kick the career out off an Man City’s players knee and 20 odd years later his far more talented son who could play anywhere in the world (even considering Man City’s wealth) decides to go to them for no motivation whatsoever …… for at least an season or two and almost single-handedly destroys us 😐!🤣
Huge setback. Casemiro needs to replace McTom, we need a true youngish striker to replace Rashford.  Anthony and Sancho need to feel confident when they send the ball to the middle, that a true striker will make use of their chance.
We need a Keane "they should be embarrassed" compilation.
And if u actually deep it, takin away nolstagia!  Pep guardiola might be the best manager football has ever seen! He creates monstrous footballing teams! He's special
Man U are shocking 🤣🤣🤣
Keane "a big club like Manchester United"   This is united summed up. Still living in the "we won the treble so we should be winning the league 25 years later because we are united"
I'll never get used to the token female.....
revenge
Cones 🤣🤣🤣
I haven't seen the game but the City had 10 shots on target vs Utd's 8. And City had 55% possession, that's not that high. How the hell did Utd get thrashed like this? Feels like the time when Man Utd couldn't make it out of the UCL group stages because of Besikas. Wish I had watched this game.
Chelsea played city(halaandless) in 2019 and lost 6-0, Manchester United managed to score goals and lost 6-3. RESPECT TO UNITED
Man City just has way to much firepower, Man U simply can't match them blow for blow.
Just imagine how good City would be if they had Almiron instead of Grealish.
I could swear that i was watching a FIFA game.🧐🤨😵
Shoutout to Micah for actually talking tactics. I'm getting sick of these pundits that talk about feelings  and pride. Even at their best, ManU gets dismantled if they play with Eriksen as DM
We are tired if your nonsense. win some champions league trophy/trophies and then you start making some noise as the greatest premier league team ever. And maybe then we will listen.
Very even game, City just slightly better, just a bad day at the office, time to recoup and go again for winning the title.
How often I hear this for MU ... it's embarrassing.... years back I said they are the new " Arsenal " .. boy was I right!?
As an Arsenal fan it used to be entertaining hearing Keane and Neville criticise Utd but the one dimensional nature of it makes it seriously tiring. It's particularly annoying having to hear Neville go on about it all game. You don't hear them say that about Bournemouth.
Always coming Roy,  man United milles behind.
they played with so much fear i was honestly suprised
Erling making sure he gets revenge for his dad.
Roy "broken record" Keane. Tell us something we dont know governor!
Few years of endless millions does that.  It's like the plastic fake "10"  woman with fake tits fake ass fake waist fake lips fake brows wigs fake tan, extensions and just everything. At a cocktail. Her with her also plastic cousin(psg) although having a slightly less experienced surgeon. Mingling with natural "conventional" 8s and 10s Even "5s" or lower with beautiful personalities and super fun and sexy in their own way. Smh  Gimme small but natural over big but fake any day. No this wasn't written by a 13 year old 😆😆 Just the feeling Man City's made to order build squad feels. Just fake. Yay good for u.  Bravo.   And im Madridista not even a follower of EPL aside from newcastle which they will soon be the same -_- smh. W.e it is what it is.
Usual Man Utd for the last 2 years
I'm afraid of haaland of breaking messi's 91 goals
United should of started martial and put casimiro alongside mctomney with Ericsson or Bruno infront of them.  United players babies too soft .
I don’t think I’ve seen a premier lge team break like Man City since the invincibles
Roy Keane we could’ve had haaland but because of you karma hit us
Only Roy can stop a Haaland!
most yo yo team in the league. Beat Aresnal then get trounced by City😄 wtf
I kinda disagree with Roy Keane. The players should be embarrassed when they're making silly mistakes or screwing up. Truth is, they're just not good enough. Yes they may not be playing their best, but even then I doubt anyone can take on this city side. Haaland, KDB, Foden, Gundogan, Silva.... they're just a different league right now. Head and shoulders above everyone
I think Utd players are feeling the cost of living.. Its effecting there game.. ⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽
The whole Man Untd was a different team today,it was so loose
Flattering result on utd. It should have been 10
When your midfield play as poor as ours did today, any team would have struggled.
Credit to roy keane praising city !!!
Casemiro and Ronaldo should have started. I’m not saying they would have won the game but they both have bags of experience
Why we silent about the penalty shame on var and the referee
Its a good job guardiola took pity on city or it would have been 10 or 11.
Never would have happened under Jose. United had a pedigree manager in Jose and they sacked him
Well we won the second half
Lol United came in with one game plan as they did their previous games won possession by silly mistake and long ball counter with pace like they did Arsenal but City barely loss balls not talking of silly mistakes and Pep knew that’s Man U only game plan so he brought in all his fastback line, when united game plan didn’t work a bit they have no other plan
Man Utd spending all this money for this shambolic performances...omg. Look those average teams like West Ham or Wolves, Brighton...City are not allowed to score this many goals. Where is that physicality and aggression. That moment of magic from Anthony would always be faded by a double hatrick of City players.
Remember ten Haag saying ‘eras come to an end’ 😂😂😂
Roy Keane is the only man to compete with Haaland right now
Yeah let’s blame Ronaldo as usual
Don't  blame Man Utd players. The fact is Man City is just too good that they are capable of humiliating any premier league team
bad result for city 😡 should have scored 3 hat-tricks😡
Micah trying so hard not to laugh😂
If you cannot be bothered running and unforced errors,what do you expect.
Give city the league for the next 10 years easy they’ll probably catch up to united league title record
Well we won the second half 🤡
United need more Ajax players ….. how do you expect a coach to succeed
Roy's beard nearly popped off his face at one point, he was so raging!
Different levels here now.
The Special One was sacked by this board and since that date United defense is trash 🗑 Forgive them Jose, they didn’t know what they were doing
You've got to love Roy says it as he see it ❤️👋
Can anyone tell me why managers will pay 60/70/80 million pound for world class players n then not play them? Sure we bought Casemiro to play defensive middlefield so why was mcSauce on?
“THERE IS NO PASSION, THERE IS NO VISION, THERE IS NO AGGRESSION” - Every United fan rn
Nothing is going to change benching cr7 Still thay will lose 😂
I think Man City were simply unstoppable today. There was effort and some pride I. united to keep going, but the game just showed how much of a job united have on their plate. The service for Haaland and the player he is, just take them to another level, on top of the dominant team who’ve won countless PL’s
Casemiro and Ronaldo should have played. Them not playing was an absolute joke.
Cant blame Maguire anymore.
come on guy's. you have all the talents in city. of course they will destroy man united.y'all still playing Maguire😂😂
That’s what you call Heritage.
I think that was a good score for United. They were going to be in for a hard time.
Listening to Roy Keane and absorbing his insights and critiques of any team, ESPECIALLY United, is football punditry and footballing analysis at its very best. 🇮🇪🇮🇪
😂
Guardiola actually gave them an olive branch with those subs 🤣
Only mutd can survive Is to bring back Sir Alex ferguson enough is enough
Keane talking crap. Man City were out of this world...they would have run circles around Keane.
United had full confidence on this games 😅😅
Say something about finished Ronaldo😂
City's noise neighbours humiliated Was there ever any doubt of the outcome?
Finally someone who was not fooled by the wins against Liverpool and Arsenal. You can't hope to go through the whole season playing in your own half and hoping for opponents to leave acres of space between their defenders and goalkeeper.
Yet no one can say it's because of cr7
Roy kean, Manchester united are used to being down 4=0 at half time 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Man u board : United are ahead of schedule lads.
Cristiano Ronaldo has not won: - UCL in 5 years - Ballon d'Or in 6 years - Golden Boot in 7 years - WC KO game in 16 years  System player carried by Modric and Kroos.
Battle of the baldest..pep is the baddest.
The thing I like about this city team is that they never stop attacking. KDB is an amazing soccer player
City are lucky Harry Potter wasn’t playing
Those glasses tho
Eriksen marking Haaland at a corner kick was really funny
If I was pep I would be embarrassed to have that good of a team
I think that is the gap between us and city.
Keane saying City is one of the best teams he's ever seen. That sums it up. Love 'em or hate them, they are just brilliant.
To me Manchester City are playing FIFA with everybody else Roy's got to chill sometimes you get a player like Haalad and they are just that damn good cuz I know he wouldn't have been able to do nothing against him 🤔
I don't know wtf Keane is on about set back lol, manpoo was NEVER winning that game from the off....never haha
Ferguson please come back
Haaland got the perfect revenge. Take that Keane... suck on that big L..
Roy Keane back on to earth after how he praised utd after getting help from var during arsenal match last week😂😂
Man United should be happy with that score  Could of been a lot worse for them
"Man city scored 6 goals, thoughts?" Keane : that's their job 😂
😂😂😂
Ronaldo fault again right?....
MU going backwards again!
This is why Harry Maguire is so important
where is Maguire when you need him 😐
City is too good lol
How many would City have scored if Maguire had been playing?
Love how the big man toned it down for Roy showed respect could have stuck it right up him 💙✌️🇬🇧
united gonna need lots of time to improve their level
man city wouldve won by a much bigger margin but i think they didnt want to score more on the second half out of respect
Why's it always about Manchester United? Why not talk about the winners? SkySports are obsessed with Manchester United win or lose they get all the talk.
United were a disgrace.
Roy Keane should be manager for United honestly he’s been speaking facts for long time and knows how to play the game
Man United back to default settings 😂🤣
It was so sad to see Ronaldo's face warming the bench. I dont care if he goes to  MLS but he needs to leave United cause he gets to much disrespect from Ten hag!!
There is nothing united could have done !! City are just miles ahead!!! City were already great before haaland but with him oh my god they have reached different levels!!! Dude was hungry for goals!!!
Mctominay & Eriksen were a disaster. Rashford at 9 doesn’t work. Ten hag needs to learn and get casemiro in the side. Enough is enough
It's just scary how many goals City are going to score this season. And not just with Haaland popping in 3 every week.
Is not the players being embarrassed they are just not good enough and United still do need about 10 good signings, overhaul was needed but they didn't do that, who is Scott to be playing game in and out, feel sorry for Cr7
sad day for united fans bros… wild
I thinks man united players, in their minds, have accepted to be underdogs and with time this derby is going to be tasteless
Haaland is nephalim
I’m a simple Man I see Roy Keane talking about Manchester United I click 🤷‍♂️
I want ROY to interview ERLING
0:26 Wow Roy Keane really had a hard time saying that, but respect to him. Always say it as it is!
Defence looks leaky without Maguire
We should have pressed from the medium block with a high line to make the pitch smaller for them and kept the ball and used it better. I love ETH and support him but he got his tactics completely wrong today. Extremely naive.  I agree with ETH on benching Ronaldo but disagree about Casemiro. Despite of Scott’s performances, Casemiro deserves a run of games to integrate with the team and show his quality. Of ETH continues to leave him on the bench, he will lose fitness and confidence and end up flopping.
Roy has a lot of talk WHY? Dosen't he go and manage United? Instead of sitting in air condition Studios mouthing off. These players need a character like him in their dressing room and training fields go and help! Them....FACTS! Gunners 4 life!!👈🏾and where on top of the league, let City come to the Emirates with that bs and we will deal with them and send them back up the M1-M60 quick time🤣
Why should they be embarrassed!!!Man Utd are rebuilding City are in a phase people need to accept this
Blackpink Jennie needs to put on a Man U jersey again for a bit of luck refresh for these losers.
Stupid 👎
I was surprised to see rodri on the bench knowing UTD are quite good on the counter. I thought pep played a gamble.
Your worse nightmare Roy (Haalands)
Rashford looked injured and not fit, at 1-0 it was okay, as soon as Varane got injured we looked like we gave up. Mctominay is a fraud, don't know how anyone can think he's a top player. Casamerio needed to start today in such a big game.
I can't believe Ten Haag didn't start with Casemiro & Anthony. That was a text-book miscalculation
The amount of wages these players get every week, they should be helping out in the cost of living crisis.
this excuses from the ex players is the reason why manchester united won't return back to where they belong. arsene wenger perfectly described the weakness by saying they have problems in the flanks
if keane had gone for alf's balls he would never had had to make this rank
Setting the bar ! Cities Bar is in the stratosphere 🤦‍♂️ Utds Bar is Jadon Sancho who’s all of a sudden in a City/Utd combined 😂 I’m a Liverpool fan , we’ve pushed City to make it a contest the past 5/6 seasons. We’re now 9th ffs 🤦‍♂️ City could easily do the quadruple. Simply unbeatable now 😒
🍿🍿🍿 grab some of them guys
Roy Keane as United coach. Please.
Every team has a plan until they are 4-0 down at half time
We will never progress with Mctominay in the middle of the pitch
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂getiiiin
City we’re on their deck chairs with cigars on in the second half, Utd can’t take anything away from that game, the gulf in class was immense and not sure what his pre match team talk consisted of as his players looked like rabbits caught in the headlights
This is Manchester United
Both teams were terrible defensively
Ah Man City are on another level to literally everyone else. Haaland though….
The coach has to rotate why starting mctomimay every time over casimeiro
i just feel sorry ronaldo is losing his last years in this team but at least he didnt betrayed them  for city like would easier to do
Ferguson lost 6-1 to City. They are improving 🤣😂🤣
1 shot for every bad pass from ManUTD
Utd is only a small club now. It isn't nearly as big as the 90s utd.
Man City were sloppy and lethargic in second half. Crowd sort of led it. Dead at start second half but Pep was furious. Silva is a little gem. De Brunye and Haaland going to help each other to assist and goal scoring records. City can't be complacent though. They don't get to play Man United every week 🤣
Mikah Richards on the inside 😂😂😂
Haha I love it
Naive ---- thats it
That Bundesliga Sancho still hasn’t turned up yet..
Back to reality lol
New coach needed at Man United!...God bless yall take care...
Everyone has been raving about Mctominay recently but as long as he’s in the starting 11 we’ll never win anything. He’s championship standard. He got found out today.
Can’t blame Ronaldo no more
How many more years and managers is Roy Keane going to be saying the same thing as he has for the last 5 years ?
Keane tryin not to say Haaland for 4 minutes
Eriksen and Fernandes are players who do not tackle. That’s why midfield was overrun.
Roy thinking he took out the wrong Haaland
Bruno is just terrible..he's so stubborn and always crying but he's the problem
the city owners should talk to Guardiola why he behaves strangely and destroy the extraordinary works he did. He did it with Real Madrid and now with united. He should be questioned. If united or Madrid won 6/1 they won't stop scoring because they don't care about city or thier managers.
Martinez the butcher 😂😂
Imagine if Maguire started 😳
Listen bad day for man u, but where was Pogba???
When Rashford wins player of the month in September you know football is dead
Anyone hearing the beep in the background too?
Keane must be having flashbacks on what he did to Haaland's dad
Idk man City are going hammer alot of teams this season. No one can control Haaland.
What is Luke Shaw and Mc Tominay doing on a team that aspires to win a Champions League.
Can't believe Keano has to sit through all this
Casemiro, Martial, Antony are the positives. Varane's injury is a huge blow. We played well in the second half but it was not enough. We will keep fighting it's a marathon not a sprint. We will come back stronger. GGMU. GLAZERS OUT.
The difference was confidence for me that’s it mancity has it. Don’t come to me about we use to it no it was just confidence that’s all and some players didn’t turn up today we didn’t. We back to work out what happen today cause second off we played better fair play to mancity yes they got a beast manu need to learn confidence we have damn good team didn’t deserve that six. It we fought back point for that but more hard work I’m not gonna dismiss how we beat arsenal and liverpool: we did that. We get them next time
Man u are a mid league team end of
Fire vs Fear 😀
Bad game for us United fans. We will come back stronger.
Ten Hag is the worst coach of Man Utd. How could he keep CR7 on bench in such match?
Funny how people tend to forget that we lost 6-1 to City at OT back in the 2011-12 season, and that was under SAF! Yes, the team back then at least pushed City all the way in the title race, but that performance was also embarrassing. That being said, 6-3 flattered us.
Keane and Haaland have a long history-this one was personal
Nothing to do with how much money was thrown at Man City?
Sancho and Rashford dont wanna help out the defence no trackback walks around like a lost puppy when they lost the ball.. next summer transfer more deadweight needs to leave. Get rid of all the players from ogs mourinho van gaal era..
😮😅
Thank u city for not embarrassing us more
What got me was ,even man city was 4 nill up,they ran and ran ,closed player's down as thought it was 0-0..
Arteta v Pep for the title? I need it
The bought ronaldo to win the league
man United won the second half 3 2 haha
What about the trash selection? What about the team formation? Any mention of that? The players that played didn't cover themselves in glory, but neither did the manager.
In the words of Roy Keane "Absolute shambles "
Is anyone really shocked by this result we all know Utd get found out and crumble against city and I’m a Utd supporter but at 3-0 turned off
It was a tough game for Man Utd.
It's a disappointing state when you're midfield can't make a pass.
Aren’t they always embarrassed we have this conversation every week
Year 6 vs. Month 3  That’s the long and short of it.
If Ronaldo had played, the score would have been 6-0 for Man City. Thanks Ten Hag for benching him.
"Twitter started to a slore of the blocks". Hm, indeed.
They are against the best team in the world and managed 3 goals, city are just on a different level
Utd made City look good.
Apologies to halland father live on air y dossar y are responsible for all this
Thats exactly the gap that unite needd to catch up with if there to compete. Not impossible but large.
The coach is to blame first before the players. He was supposed to make changes after 20 mins
I don’t want to hear that it was ten hags fault it was the players
This better then Prime AFTV 🤣
Roy Keane broke Haalands fathers leg. Man City broke Man Utds legs today.
Another Man U dressing down by Keano.
city is too good for united
Jokes aside and purely an observation. Man uniteds front line seems OK. Even today they managed to still score and be a goal threat even when they were losing badly. Its everywhere else on the pitch they are struggling. The midfield isn't nearly good enough and the full backs are too poor. If they improve these areas they will be a lot better overall and more solid too.   Congrats to city. Outstanding performance today. 👏
Scot mctommy couldn't even press his own outfit, useless
THATS THE UTD WE ALL LOVE HOPE THEY LOSE AGAINST EVERTON  AS WELL
Us Manchester united fans are now numb to the pain. It doesn't even hurt anymore and as a fan that's scary
Real Madrid -> 14 Champions League titles Brentford FC -> same as Manchester City
ETH will be known as the manager who grabbed the 20 years brilliant carriers of CR7 in 3 months and Casemiro in 1 month 😂😂😂😂 Haaland if ETH want to buy you, just run away from ETH otherwise you will destroy your future 😂
It is a delusion to think anyone can beat this City team right now, Liverpool arguably the other best team came close but still faltered at the end. As long as they have Pep and the huge investing by their owners, it is very hard to see anyone beating them at this stage.
United were woeful  No cohesion,no energy,no passion or fight.They were an utter disgrace. City on the other hand were ruthless..Haarland is on a different level..he’ll end with 40 this season & player of the year
Roy Keane should be to blame for Haaland's Juggernaut unstoppable smashing performance.
OUR ROY KEANE IS BACCCCKKKKK😂
Pep has got his last piece of puzzle in Haaland. He is probably going to get everything this season probably.
Ten hag made a few mistakes today which us understandable. Erikson was poor because he didn't have a midfield partner... Scot mctommy, always hiding from the ball, invincible man in midfield.. Casemiro have to start.
Maguire best city player on the pitch 🤥
Gutted had 6-0
3:09 _”Everybody got a plan.....till they get punched in the face!”_ ~ Roy Tyson
Just admit it Man U is no longer a big team, its an avarage club at best that's the harsh truth!
Football fans, before man City match, everyone was praising how man utd has transformed and how they think Teng is doing a great job and his team and can every team. I'm surprised how the tone has suddenly change after man City game.
why is micha even a pundit he was bang average as a player and his analysis is terrible
The best revenge on keane and man utd from Halaand family
Bruno had more screen time arguing wit the ref than he did making any plays with ball.
Every one has a plan untill u get punched in the face 🤣
Why is he talking as if all of this is not his fault?
I missed this premium content
Roy Keane is an excellent pundit, Richards is a joke and only there because of PC IMO
Could’ve been 8-1 if Guardiola didn’t make the substitutions
United: Spends 60 million for Casemiro United: Never starts Casemiro  United: Has Ronaldo and last seasons team leading scorer healthy United: Doesn't play Ronaldo  United: Needs to make halftime substitutions to deal with midfield getting destroyed United: Subs out Malacia for Luke Shaw  ETH masterclass this week against Man City!
City beat every team in the world playing like this. Dont jugde United on this game.
Who thinks City will winthe champions league this year?
High pitched sound in the background - not the first time either
Manchester United is a mess. You buy players that are no longer good enough to play at the top level for ridiculous money only to have them sit on the bench
We got piped haaland is a monster i hate to love him
Big lesson - not setback. Go again!!
I’m Sorry this is Keano’s fault, he should of know his son was gonna be world class!
I guess Maguire WASN'T the problem after all 😆😆😆
QUALITY
The Man City twins scored 2 hattricks, HaaLand and Foden, KDB synchronised his movements with HaaLand through the ball crossed today 😍❤️
Roy keane having a winge, hook it to my veeeinnnnnssss
its a shame, that keane has no son who is playing for manunited. imagine keane jr vs haaland jr how great it would be  edit: its also a shame that neymar never met keane on the football field 😃
the glazers must go they made this club worst
The scoreline flatters Man United.....
Manu utd lost because maguire is not playing .
Keano must hate it 😂😂😂😂
OIL CAN GET YOU ANYTHING UNFORTUNATELY
Harry maguire was a HUGE miss for utd
I don't think they should be embarrassed, this is just the level they're on right now and the score simply reflects the gap in quality between the two teams
Ten Haag needs to place Eriksen as a CAM and put Casemiro and McTom of the middlefield defensively.. Bruno really needs to be benched
the fact that we scored 3 goals makes us look better then we were, City should of won the game by atleast 7 goals but preserved their energy in the first half as well as subbing off key players when it was 6-1, as well counting the chances they had, this scoreline as mad as it seems as we've conceded 6 is extremely generous towards us because its not a reflection!
Relegation  teams don’t play the way man united players play today —-dreadful players
United passing in the 1st half was disastrous. Like blind men
Wonder what almiron thought of grealish's performance.
I enjoy so much watching MU play.😂😂😂 Rashford? Sancho? Really? Are you serious??? 😳
does  roy say anything else ....like a stuck record
Keane always says it as it is
United fans saying at least we won second half is one of the most shameless things I’ve heard lol 😂
I guess some of ya'll will be like " Why doesn't he take up the manager role?" with the way he's roasting ya'll.
Ronaldo is the problem 😂
If bruno was a man city player, he wouldn't even start, thats the gap
It can't be easy for Roy to admit when Utd play badly! I have to admire him though for being honest. It will take some effort to stop City from retaining the league title this year, I just hope that Arsenal can keep them at bay!
i wished he went for haaland's balls instead of his leg. We wouldn't have a nightmare of a striker in the opposition 😅
Lost is lost ( Maguire )
I love Roy Keane, but I wish he didnt beat around the bush so much.
Ten hag needs to change the formations , it should be 5-3-2 at least an I would put Casemiro on the middle with McTommay and put even McGuire as a defensive midfielder , just for this game it had to be extra defensive , even if everyone is criticizing man united  a year ago would have been 9-0 in man city favor , but today we scored 3 goals and that is a good thing , please give ten hag time , he is doing a fantastic job .
No CR7 no Party...
Sanchez can't even take on players as a winger he can't even drive with the ball and cause havoc
I was hoping to see another 8-2...they could've done it... Dont know why they stopped trying near the end
Is there a more boring pundit than Keane. Says the same thing every time.
Here we go again we roy
Harland to get 40 goals ? N I thought Shearer was great !
What would have been worst, losing 6-3 or losing 3-0?
Haaland is the reason why Bundesliga is better than the Premiere League
Ronaldo 232 Matches -3 Hattrick  Haaland 8 Matches-3 Hattrick
2 weeks ago people said MU can fight fot titles
Good weekend. Arsenal win 3 - 1. Man u lose 6 - 3
Every week we see Keane and neville slag off the players but the clubs not good enough living in the past pundits accept what you are and have been forba decade
It's Ronaldo's fault.
Wrong tactics for a start.
need dejong
its all Roy Keane's fault... if he hadn't did Alfie dirty we could've had erling in united. Now Erling got his geetback for his daddy...
MU in news : Tiger MU in reality: Cat
Roy Keane Usually talks about fighting spirit, desire, hunger and passion.  When he talks about quality being poor and decision making being all over the place. Then we must know how bad some of the players are. specially players like Rashford and Mctominay, they may have the passion but there is no quality and brain to be in a top team and match with the likes of Bernardo, Mahrez, KDB.
Lazy celebrity Man U players. Reduce their wages and watch some real hunger!!!!!!
Love to see Manutd lose, just to see hobo Keane knows everything better :P
Roy keenes fast becoming a joke. He's not really a pundit. His opinion  changes on a weekly basis. He's just like any fan. Why have biased fan boys as "pundits"
Lo United prende calci nel deretano ovunque..e poi hanno fatto gli scienziati contro l'arsenal qualche settimana fa...baaaaaaaaahhhhhhh
It’s should of been 10
If u played on this time most of the game u take red card.
MU love mediocre players with Mediocre performance & talent ..🤪🤪They don't trust the most talented players in the world ...coz Mediocre management & coach with Mediocre IQ  will give mediocre result ..🥱🥱🥱
Rashford and Sancho wish things could just happen they never try to make them happen.
Why does Keane still get air time? He's about as much a impartial pundit as Manchester United are a half decent side. Manchester United set backs.... From finishing 6th 🤣
I hate how the sad united supporters are always talking as if ManU they have zero quality in their team😐
erling revenge for roy ending dad's career
Erikssen expired
Only CR7 could have saved Utd and won the game for them today
Roy is the truth bomb pundit.  No messing
A smile on my face the moment I see Keane and a United loss in a thumbnail
Why though? Utd are nowhere near as good as City , it's the owners who should be embarrassed, paying David De Gea 375k a week (Most expensive gk in football) when your club is a Europa League team , striker earning 500k a week to sit on the bench ... Maguire is 80 million pounds 😂...This club keeps throwing money without any logic
Maybe Roy and others need a bit of a reality check. For years now they've been hyping this United squad up too much. Even with the new additions they're still ordinary.
Until manu change the goalkeeper there will be more defeats
*Ask Roy whether United will finish above Arsenal again 😂😂😂😂😂😂*
Man city didn’t even play with a DM
Who cares? It’s a morons game.
Micah always has the freshest trims lol
Haaland. 😳🥰
Even though Utd was embarrassed and deservedly so they had some positives to take away from the game, only in the 2nd half though....they had more possession, more shots on goals, more goals
I think united played better… lol
The only thing similar between United and City is the city, Manchester.
Two many players suffering hangovers simple!
they need to bless their entire team, players, stadium, and maybe consult some Feng Shui master
When Neville and Tyler started saying scoring three is something to show for the game. No it’s not, you still conceded 6. Totally embarrassing performance.
Next time play Maguire please. I had a bet for 9+ goals. And really wanted to do 12+ for the 9999/1
Now I know why ETH got the trophy as best manager, to many flowers has a price and this has been paid today 😂
It was almost like a lads v dads game when the dads let the lads score a couple of goals to not feel bad.
does stevie wonder help richards with his hair
Those EPL commentators compared Haaland with Messi… Haaland is very good but you just can't compare him with the most complete player the game has ever seen… Even Pep would have been surprised by that comment… Disgraceful…
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Halaand us unmatched... The boy will get past 20 goals before world cup
Embarrassed for what? “At the moment City is  almost reaching  1970 Brazil or 2009 Barca levels. If they wanna score 6 there’s nothing you can do.
Notice Roy Keane not taking Haalands name even once. Takes Fodens name but not Haaland.
The difference between the two teams was the confidence with and without the ball
Utd were expected to lose anyway. Every recovering addict has a relapse moment.. this was Utd's. How they preform next match says more about where they are as a team.
Embarrassed? just look at the lineups, from the get-go this wasn't a fair match-up.
Why didnt he put Ronaldo on
Scoreline absolutely flatters Utd, just waiting for a certain co commentator to blame the owners for the result, we all know that's what's gonna come out his mouth.
Man said they must be getting used to be 4-0 down at halftime 🤣🤣🤣
Congratulations ETH you deserved more then 6 goals 😂😂😂😂
set backs are part of the process , manutd is rebuilding these are all bumps in the road to learn from
I think we’re being too harsh. City are miles ahead of everyone else. United need a long term plan with Ten Hag at the centre of it. The process will take time, but it will happen. You can see some players have upped their game.  Arsenal fan btw.
Title contenders 😂😂😂
This just marks what makes Guardiola the best manager in the world. Not many coaches can maintain this kind of motivation for matches and if you look at how many years he's been at City, he has made the team hungry to win everything. Klopp should learn a thing or two from Guardiola and not to be over reliant on certain players. Players need to get benched to alter their mindset to have a better approach to games. Conditioning is important, players get fatigued and complacent if they play week in week out
Luckily City relaxed a bit and they didn't score 10. This is embarrassing enough, but if City played whole game, it could be the most embarrassing game in PL history
Anyone else hearing that high pitched whine in the background?
man city squad is very deep, losing 1 or 2 players due to injury doesn't really affect the team because the team has a lot of talent. 1 player can beain in several positions. that's what Man Utd doesn't have. foresight to put 1 player not in his position is actually the genius of Pep Guardiola. The power gap is also very visible between Man City and Man Utd
United get battered everywhere they gooooo, everywhere they gooooo. 😂
Grame Souness: and if pogba was still at the club it would’ve been worst… thank god pogba left
Slagging the players off but Micah nailed it. The tactics were awful from Ten Hag & he got a footballing lesson. City are too good to try to press them. You need to accept they’re gonna have the ball & make it difficult for them. Everyone back behind the ball & counter attack with a couple of really fast players.
Hopefully today has calmed Roy down as he was getting carried away after the United's Arsenal win.
Listen, Man Utd might not thank me but get the contract out, put it on the table. Let him sign it, let him write whatever numbers he wants to put on there, given what he's done since he's come in. Ten Nil's at the wheel, man. He's doing it. He's doing his thing.
As bad as Utd are, they’ll never be as bad as city was. CTID
I only wish Maguire played this game so it was even more funny. What a clown's club they have become since Sir Alex left. Man City and Man Utd are two different levels now, it is not even a derby anymore
It is embarrassing but I love it!!! 😅😅😅
This is why man utd need maguire in the starting line up. It would've been a different result.
I see this as United's improvement coz decades ago they were losing 6-1 now they're losing 6-3 so technically they're improving 💪💪💪💪& city @ the same level
Ronaldo career exploited by incompetent MU Management team & now Casemiro also following his footstep ..For God sake both are one of the best in the world ..they can change any game single handedly ..Prize tag coach 🤣🤣🤣better return to his previous club
MU will take 5 years to catch up.
Naive performance! United thought they could go toe to toe playing Ten hag's style of football vs City. Should've parked the bus and counter.
My ears really enjoyed the background noise
United were like a rabbit caught in the headlights today.. Didnt know what to do
The pain in Keano’s voice even saying Haalands name 😂, sums up us Utd fans overall
Roy breaks down this perfectly
5 wins on the trot, Man United turned a corner...drubbing by their rival, wtf happened?
Manchester is BLUE
Nothing changed !!!
In the 4 games they have won, they have taken the lead.What would happen if they have to chase?
Rashford trash
Pogba really let the team down, didn’t show any intent to mark the ball. He’s the weak link and the reason they are misfiring
Was anyone surprised? There is a lot of work ahead. Getting carried away because we won a couple of games. Still miles away from the top.
Phil Foden scored more goals in this match than his whole england career and he used to take a front 3 slot instead of next generation players
Parking the bus with a back 6 and walloping balls into the channels to antony an rashford who sits on the halfway line like a goal hanger in school. These tactics get you nowhere. Said this to utd fans after they beat us and arsenal. Both teams absolutely blitzed united but they just got lucky.   Knew city would wipe the floor with them. Them coward tactics dont work ten haag u little fraud
The level of physicality and fitness level to play in the Premier League has only been increasing with each new season. Manu have one of the most if not the most lazy bunch of individual players who literally stop running 15 minutes into the game.
It's not about Halland being the best striker but about the amazing service he received. Look at Norway. They lost their last nation league game and Halland couldn't bail them out. No service, no goals as simple as that.
Face the fact Manu just cos you guys won a few games doesn't make your team any where good like how Ferguson had. Tq you pep
The new players have no concept of the rivalry of the derby game. United doesn’t have a first team that is hungry for the win and somehow think that they can cruise into the top 4 after their last winning streak. Find a way to get Ronaldo, Casimiro and Eriksson to play in the first team to get the experience back into the play.
Ten Haags United needed that humbling
Once again Roy Keane not giving the other team credit for playing them of the pitch
Cty keane
Of all the players, Eriksen defends Haaland on that corner. Who decided that?
What can you say? The fans deserve this actually. They been claiming they want a different club but only show up when they loose badly. If they beat City today they’d nowhere be close to Glazers out, and yet the loss today left them too drained to even call for protests
The way man United fans left quickly Etihad stadium to abandon their team in the difficult moment of the game (half time) was a bad behavior. Sir Alex Ferguson stayed until the end.
Even during the United glory days, derbies were always neck to neck and competitive despite significant difference in players' quality.  Manchester derbies nowadays are so boring to watch!
Hahahahaha  That's what happens when you don't make Cristiano Ronaldo your number 1goalnwcorer hahaha many sucks
Harry Maguire awful as usual.... oh wait he wasnt playing. Perhaps the defensive problems are bigger than one player.
everyone always slating Maguire, not even on the pitch today, Varane and Malacia were torn to pieces
City could play 2 teams that would be in the top 4. The have a generational manager and the most money. It's simple really. Still not won the Champions League. Once they do and Pep goes then they will never reach these heights again. Enjoy it City
Stop saying the same thing again and again. Come up with something new Roy.
Fair play to Roy Keane for the sportsmanship and calling City "magnificent". You don't see that happen in my country (Portugal), the club bias clouds people judgment. Well said 👏
Imagine if maguire played 😩😩😩😩😩
Man Utd from last season are BACK 😂😂😂😂😂
United is done sorry
Rashford lazy, Bruno non existent. It's a derby nobody got stuck in. Rediculous. The first half was one of the worst half's I have ever seen.
When you see "Unbeaten in all 14 appearances in Manchester derbies" you realize what's coming…
As a city fan, Fernandes should be dropped he’s so sloppy with the ball, he gets the ball and just hits and hopes, can’t keep the ball long enough, push eriksen higher
Well you can’t blame Maguire for this one 😂
This right but Manchester United will back again GGMU 😌
They should have played the Legendary Harry Maguire. He could've scored 10 goals.
Imagine, while you are reading this, that one day in the future  Keane takes charge of man united and brings back their glory days...  What a story that would be 🤯   You heard it hear first 😉😂
anyone else hear the buzzing? You'd think someone would catch it before posting the video
I hate/hated United for almost 30 years now. But i have to say it i honestly feel bad for Roy Keane that he has to watch such garbage for 10 years now...
if ETH doesnt bench rashford in the next PL match, then theres is something really wrong with him
Ronaldo just wasted 6 months of his playing career. He must sitting at home wondering why did he listened to Sir Alex
Whilst Kean has a point about this United team, Ten hag has only started working with them this season, 7 games in to be exact now compare that to Pep had city, Pep has been with that team for a while now had season after season of bringing in the best players. I would be worried if I was a city fan and they didn’t steam roll this “new” United side.
Don't want that battle it's ok to finish top 4 get paid huge bucks hopefully win a cup that sums it up ..
I have never hated a pundit as much as I hate Roy Keane.
Stupid pundits of England football were saying that Haaland is a flop player Just want to say these England football journalists are always stupid
Never play bruno and Erikson in a game against a possession team. They can't and don't run.
Grealish really really did his part today 🫡
The funniest are those claiming a midget will stop a giant 🤣 😂
Embarrassing is begging city to finish over liverpool
United did the worst deffending and even more worse attacking
City is levels above every club in the Premiership.   Arsenal have started off exceptionally well but that one point lead won't hold for much longer.   Only doubt I have about City is will they finally get over their Champions League hump.
Don’t you ever try to play rashford as a number 9 again Erik ten hag
Starting Erikson in a game like this in CM is baffling  It only works against the smaller teams
Haaland avenged his father😂
Why does Roy call it a setback, they’ve not been playing well in the games they’ve won...if arsenal had their shooting boots on it could have been similar score
If he did moved to either Barcelona or real Madrid and scoring like this, you would hear so called pundits and arrogant fans saying how much la Liga is an easy league to score goals like I have been hearing that Haaland isn't too good just the defending in Bundesliiga is poor. Haaland making EPL defenders like high school defenders is not nice at all🤣
Utd is the shame of Manchester😂😂😂
Gr8 FIXture for Man City v The London Reds
Eric ten Allardyce 😂😂
Manchester City is the perfect example of backing the manager and giving him the players he wants/needs to produce results. Maybe give ETH what he needs or wants and he'll have United playing better!
cant wait for saliba to pocket haaland
Roy keane never holds back the truth
It´s so heartwarming to see Haaland's revenge. Roy did not enjoy seeing the team of his heart getting bullied by the son of the man he ended.
This is actually painful to watch feels like the premier league is being taken away from us
Nearing 10 years since Sir alex left and UTD are still thinking that they are rebuilding... Nord stream 1 and 2 might be built faster than UTD
Tuchel in.
This is not what I expected to see today this is terrible 😔
Im still waiting/wanting Keane to take charge at Peterborough Utd - love this guy
It’s not the team there club is in massive decline has been for over a decade now clubs just throwing money down the drain and certain players will take it with both hands⚽️😜🙈
Just think what the score would’ve been if maguire played 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pity city didn't get 10!! 🤭🤭🤭🤭
Imagine being 8 games into the season and you've already been down 4-0 at the half in two separate games...
Through ball fc
United was lucky City did not go for the 10. City took their best players out.
Putting only mctomminay as a defensive  player in the front 6 was the problem,  all blame lies on ETH
The inquisition at ManU begins afresh, again...
I mean this is Manchester Utd we're talking about.
How they should be embarrassed  !? Come  on  .6-3 it  is not 6-0 .
Come to OLD TRAFFORD boys❤️
Come to OLD TRAFFORD boys❤️
Wow who knew that allowing mediocrity for years and choosing marketing over results would have consequences!
I agree everything with Roy, I was just reading an article website on Sky sports and I saw the game today, I think we all have to agree that was the best performance in the first half of city I’ve ever seen,I really enjoyed it,watching city this is how teams should play,if you press high and put your opponent on the pressure,this is how city should do not only in the premier league but the champions league,every time city play whether in the semi-final or final, they are missing something but this first half play like that you will win a trophy.United should be embarrassed,you can get good results against a struggling team,you have to show in a derby match with passion and fight,unfortunately we didn’t see anything on United.
Manchester United's defenders are not able to move organically and their body is small, but they are slow and have a lot of passes.
I think Erick Ten Hag is a very good manager than pep. Just give him time..Man United Can win every game, premier League and european trophies if the leadership,players,fans, journalists should believe in him and should give to him more time to transfert the quality of players hould want, the way he would like to play football to perform  good results like guardiola.
The difference was an organised team VS an unorganized team.   United were asleep from the off today.   City were brilliant in every aspect of the match.
Man City are Rihanna and United are Shy Ronnie
United does not have quality players to press rival, defenders not ready for a second play in the own area…as a massive Real Madrid fan, I really feel bad to see this team being so “naive” lacking of competitive spirit. It will take a decace to rebuild this team.
Utd are were psychologically beaten before they stepped over the white line. They will always struggle with City if they show them this must respect all the time.
If ETH put 3 centerback, 3 defensive midfield to limit the space KDB and Haaland had near the box, Man U shouldnt concede 6 goals like that so easily
People need to remember United did win the second half, and that's a huge positive
mancity had a poor team ake and akanji.we made them look good.we could have been ruthless put martial and rashford and a strong defence,poor tactics by tenhag,then bring cr7 to finish the game off.
United’s 4th time in 23 months conceding 4 goals in the first half.
It was just difference in class , quality and these players for City have been playing together for years now trained by the best coach in the world. United players lacked that quality and chemistry as compared to City. Can't blame the players much here...as City were far superior today. It would take years for United to reach City's levels and Ten Hag must stay to coach these players. The players have glimpses of talent ( Lisandro , Anthony etc ) Just have to improve them and increase the chemistry.
The sloppiness was embarrassing.  Could tell they weren't just nervous, they were horrified.
Against Brenford 4 goals in 35min Against man city 4 goals in 45min Great progress 👏👏💪💪
Roy Keane loves Man City and hates Utd so much now that he's wearing city colours in the derby game.
Theses sky pundits, are constantly crying and focusing on United
Naivety. That sums it up. We'll see if EtH learns from this.
when you look at the game Man U were were EXTREMELY!!..poor defending and had Zero energy!...i betting they wont beat Arsenal!
I really thought they were gonna give us a tough time coz last games have been improving but I guess Haaland had to score a hat trick.
The 90s are over the days of United having the transfer market to themselves are done nowadays teams on a level playing field, United can't cope with that I love it come on CITEH 🔘
what mistake from ETH. How he can make a line up with 1 Defender midfielder when he plays against a team like City ? I prefered Casemiro or Fred instead Eriksen.
I’ve watched every game that has been on in the United States and every game that Marcus Rashford has played as a number nine and he has never and I mean never never never been able to hold the ball up as a number nine
Chelsea fan. Watching Phil foden and watching mason mount this season is upsetting. That’s what we need
I feel like United came back swinging in the second half, it wasn't the pathetic fold of last season. It still wasn't enough, but there are positives to take away from the game against what is arguable the best team in Europe
How many of these videos exist by now?
Manure 😂
Man utd is crap they literally cnt talk after this
Scoreline flattered United. Very soft penalty.
Everyone's waiting for the usual annual video
Roy Keane must be feeling humiliated that Haaland scored a hat trick against his former side!!😂😂
City won this game mentally first, United players were scared
Where was Pogba?
Ok United don't have Haaland but let's be honest. Bruno despite his stat padding is light years behind KDB. There is no comparison. Bruno goes missing in big games. Shambles of a CAM or false 9 whatever he his.
at the one side Haaland. on the other rashford. what do you think? also with this Kind of defence that you start. this time Maguire would have been a good start against Haaland and I am not a big fan of him and also Ronaldo would have been a good start.   also Casimero on the bench 🙄 would have been great to start him Anthony and Ronaldo  but at least 3 goals with the B 11 for Manu  Edit: HOW THE HELL can you not bring Ronaldo
They're in cloud Cuckoo land
I love how honest this man is should be more of him around. Saying that city let 3 goals in you shouldn't be doing that with the players they have with the amount of money on the pitch.
People need to start acknowledging this City team is the best football team in Premier League history. Absolutely unbelievable and a joy to watch. We should all enjoy this team while we can.
United will not win title. It’s a two horse race between Man City and Arsenal.  However, I think they have a chance to grab on a top four spot.
Where is the so called pressing 😂.....now  only thing media and man utd fans need now is just blame CR7 again...
suuip
I can't decide if Haaland is that good or the defending in the PL is bad. Bit of both I would guess.
Could of put this on sky sprot retro, and I would of thought it was from 3 years ago. Nothings changing at that club
KEANE WILL ALWAYS BE A TOP G  GREAT PUNDIT  SOLID FELLA
No Manchester United fan me inclusive expected a win here,, I hoped we spring a surprise but no.. It was nice the boys never threw in the towel like last season.. Upwards united
The United scouting department also need to be disbanded,they've not done good all over the years, bringing in not talented up to united quality players,if they continue staying and working for united they will continue splashing huge chunks of money every window with no success at the end, the glazers need to make drastic changes to the club, if they are not capable then they should sell the club
Man city have destroyed the league. No one can keep up with there depth of squad. They just buy and sell for fun.
I just love hearing Roy Keane reactions 😂
Ten Hag got manager of the month for playing one match in September.. jokes 😂😂. I still think united can make top 4 though... Especially if Liverpool keep playing the way they are
This should clear up the fact its not Ronaldo or Maguire's fault at how bad weve been doing.
Glazers are slowly destroying the club - give it 5, maybe 10 years and the club will be completely overshadowed (in terms of silverware) by City and will be massively behind Newcastle, Liverpool, Spurs, Arsenal and Chelsea. They'll be no way to catch back up without huge investment - even more than already needed!
Haaland tackle!
Mctominay really showed his level today, to start him against a good side will be inexcusable
Don’t you think Ronaldo would’ve been better than Marcus to keep the ball better and give us a goal threat? We kept losing the ball the few times we got it in attack in the first half, leading to the pressure on our weakened defense intensifying (especially with Varane getting injured). I would’ve taken Rashford or Sancho off in the first half, got Ronaldo on, and moved Rashford/Sancho to the wing.Martial could then come on later in the game. Also, Casemiro looked good when we came on and I feel he should’ve been brought on sooner as well. What do you think?
First time I noticed Bruno Fernandes was playing in this game was after about 35 minutes when he was bickering with the ref, embarrassing how out of the game he was.
Micah's laugh is hilarious.
this is not embarrassing at ALL!! this rubbish club got 3 goals against arguably the best club side in the world ffs.
Haaland is an absolute joke
Did they really thing they have chance against city
That first half. Was disgrace. Defenders passing sideways. Soon as they launch it forward city win it and attack. Are these professionals or pub players. I can't understand it. Other teams come to city and give them a game. United just don't look interested. Rashford and Mctominay should be sold. Not good enough
How the hell did Rashford manage to win Premier League Player of the month for september?
Shocking result, ten hag got exposed
The players should be embarrassed?………. Wait I’ve heard this before am I a time traveler? 😂😂😂😂
Martinez was supposed to be good? Hmm
Congratulations to Man U fans  , 6-1 😅🤣😂😅🤣
I'd like to know what Roy would have done, facing Haaland?!      Oh wait. He would of broken his leg. Nevermind. 🤷‍♂️🙈😂
I don’t know what ppl are saying no other manger is as good as SAF give pep two more szns I think he will be on the same level maybe even better.
City's players dont have different lungs,feets,heads,hands or came from the moon The strange is every big player coming to United perform the worst after Ferguson left This doesn't happens in any other team
Any player who have stayed at United for more than 4-6yrs need to go or be sold: martial, rashford,scot,shaw,de gea,lindelof, fred,Maguire, all those players have gone through Mourinho, solkjaer,ragnick, van gaal should just leave Manchester United they aren't good enough for the team🚮🚮
I thank Guardiola for fair play and respecting the game by substituting Grealish, De Bruyne, Gundogan and Foden all at once when the score was 6:1.
The beeping 🤬
Is Ronaldo still the problem ? I don't think that way
Ten hag I don't know what to tell him but he's nothing why is he still benching Ronaldo,Casimiro
Pep was fuming because United got three goals.
As a United fan, I wasn’t that surprised.  Varane is pretty slow in terms of his reaction time, and his defensive awareness was pretty awful.  Malacia was getting ran past almost every time down the side, as well.  Malacia is just a kid, and he’ll definitely improve, but Varane is not a long-term solution at CB, and United will a strong, athletic and quick CB to pair with Martinez next summer.  Someone like Rudiger, Kounde, or even Pau Torres should be brought in.  My only surprise is that ETH waited so long to take off Malacia and Varane, because those two were basically responsible for the first half goals.
I guess the legendary player maguire was unable to stop man city on his own, I blame the rest of manchester united!!
They got dominated don’t get me wrong but 6-3 isn’t even that bad considering how quality city are. City are turning over most teams this year. Liverpool and city is gonna be an embarrassment and so will arsenal and Man City.
The writing was on the wall in the Arsenal game should never of won that game and then when you come up a against a side which is that level above it will show
2-6-2022  the end of the Ronaldo era🌹it was a pleasure to witness the great goals you made on the highest level, good luck 🐐🌹
For all United’s recent good form, they’re still a long way off.
This for sure getting a million views
I’m just waiting for Micah’s laugh 😂
Love to see it 😂😂😂😂
Thing is United really weren't that bad. This City team is just on another level to pretty much everyone else
Casemiro left European champions to sit on united bench.  Is this the “new challenge” he was referring too?
Kdb was cooking all game long
Bruno has to be the most overrated player I’ve ever seen . Always dissapears in big games and does absolutely nothing . Today was absolutely horrendous to watch . Ten hag should definitely start Casemiro and Ronaldo idk what he’s playing at
im happy we actually got 3 back hahahaha
It'll take another 3 years for Utd to challenge.  Some results will this will come along now and again as they aim to return to the top.
Ahhhh 😌 this is more like it. Was weird when people were saying United are good.
Ahhhh 😌 this is more like it. Was weird when people were saying United are good.
HAHAHAHAaaland!
Can't blame Pogba can he? Must be gutted.
Actually its Man City who should be embarrassed for letting in 3 goals..
I missed this... and utd thought they were back 🤣🤣🤣
The Brentford loss was a lot worse than this tbh. Today was more about the difference Haaland makes and how ruthless City are with him. Outside of the derby, these two sides aren't competing on the same levels.
Pogba was nowhere to be seen.
Seems like Roy would want everyone to taxi back to the hotel again
Rashford hugely Massively overrated, Mctominay not up to it Fred neither, back four a shambles.
Sack the lot of them.
Absolutely disgraceful performance Keano  calling it out again pathetic performance no fight or no desire Man City are streets ahead goes to show how far Man Utd are behind not just today last 10 years Man utd need new owners long time. Didn't mind being beaten its the nature of the loss with no fight its frustrating
I just dont understand why roy always pours his frustration on the players. City has got a coach with a system working for them and United should do same
Keane is to blame partly for this. If he hadn't injured Haalands dad, he'd maybe only have scored 2 today 😂
United should have won we beat them the second half
I get that McTominay has had a few good games, but starting him over Casemiro was criminal
I dont know why they play 4231 it's a terrible formation in terms of midfield depth that's why they keep getting over run by every team in the midfield
I thought rashford scored 4 goals today 😂😂 haaland didn’t press but he scored 3 🤣🤣
Sancho doesn't deserve to be on 250-350k a week. Stealing a living
Love watching Man U losing
TBF Utd were always going to struggle against City , who have set the bar quite high. But UTD are still rebuilding and have done alright thus far
why wasn’t Casemeiro on , you would think against a possession driven attacking team you would put on a disrupter ... Rashford was absent mostly
Horrible background noise
The difference between united and city over the last few years is crazy serious problems at united for some time to come
Rashford over Ronaldo?
🤣🤣🤣
Honestly wouldn’t be to critical of united as a Chelsea fan. I just think Man City are 2 good.
City didn’t even break a sweat , United players we’re still on International duty didn’t show up
To the "real" United fans who walked out after 44 minutes, and switched off their TV's at home too. Don't call yourself "real" when United wins trophies again.
Haaland took the father incident personally. Simple as that.
6-3 does United some justice, it was an absolute beatdown
Scary thing is.......Man United squad costs more money and more wages then City.
Anthony scored but he doesn't do much for a player that cost that much
Let’s blame Maguire…
To be fair Martial, Fred, Shaw and Antony were the only players who really gave it their all today, the rest were poor.
The manager still hasn’t found the right balance, a £70m defensive midfielder constantly warming the bench, defensively still look vulnerable. English contingent still stinking up the place.
When you realise that city didn't even have Rodri or Ruben Dias playing, it really shows how big the gap is between United
An average team scored 3 against city why should they be embarrassed.
I blame Paul pogba
Utd are back 🤣
Read my name
6-3 really flatters United. They got annihilated
6-3 makes Utd look better than they were
Rip to all headphone users !!!
Haaland proving how overrated EPL is and how overrated goalpoaching is.. Anybody can goal poach…but try to be Haaland (Poacher), De Bruyne (Playmaker) and Mahrez (Dribbler) at the same time…that’s Messi..
United attacker including Bruno could not string 2-3 passes together without losing it  . It was literally attack vs defence training ground routines .
First club team in  PL history to win 8 home games in a row and score 3+ goals in every game at the same time. 3 Haaland hat trick at home in a row Another day at the office
The content we all wanted to see. Just missing Souness asking ‘where was Pogba in all this?’
Anthony's goal was class.
I wonder if people and Ten Haag still think Ronaldo is the problem lmao smh
It’s crazy that we dismantled them so easily, I watched them against Arsenal and thought we really had something to feel concerned about
Wheres Maguire when you need him??
Beating city isnt for everyone 😂😂
During the game at one point the commentator said  "Of course as you know manchester united have not won a single trophy since Jose's first season at the club when they won both the cup and the Europa league. That was 5 years ago and they cannot win one until it becomes 6 years which is the longest trophyless run in 40 years. Irony being that jose was the last one to win by 6 against united during his spurs reign "  Seconds later the camera zoomed on Ferguson shaking his head in dissaray..   Some things just can't be made up 😂😂
They didn’t look up to a battle. They looked tired and show lack of quality consolation goals mean nothing anyone who thought we would beat City are crazy
Alf definitely smiling
Super Sunday is nothing without Roy Keane
Foden is levels above any united player
Haaland is a robot
I said it before and I'll say it again this City team is the greatest club team of all time, we are UNSTOPPABLE!
That little screetching sound is giving my tinnitus a run for it's money
Keane must be desensitised to Man U humiliating themselves by now.
Roy 🍼🍼🍼
Rubbish from united but Haaland is just a beast
