Hi 👋 and thanks for your reply and sorry to bother again again but I think 🤔 is ⏲️ so far away for the last email 📧 I have a question about my house and my house 🏠 and 👍 ❤️ and 👍 is 7th March but the other day I have a question
Awww❤❤
His reaction is priceless we love y’all 😊❤ so happy for y’all
Why i cried watching this ❤🥺
I never knew I had a husband... I thought I was getting a divorce. Why did I have babies??? Who's the father???
God is amazing so happy to see this couple both of you so nice and looks so beautiful together.
“The frick bro!” 😂
Doggo is like ...Silly humans  got me 2 socks and I have 4 paws! I'll just go play with my ball and look cute!😀 congratulations on your pending new addition to your family ❤
His reaction is Adorable!!! Congratulations ❤❤❤
I got told over text… then a month later I got told it was a miscarriage because she went and partied and did drugs. Gods plan is hurtful sometimes but never question it
Your husband is a real GREEN FLAG and you such a cute, hope you guys stay together forever ❤️
Just come out and tell him the truth
So cute
made my day
Tienes un marido  adorable y guapisimoooo
Qe risa qe nido más guapo tienes y qe sensible es un amor de jhombre
I watched you guys finding out your pregnant with baby 2 and this video came up and I wanted to watch it again. I get emotional when the partner finds out their girl is pregnant. I think Gabriel's reaction is so beautiful that it always makes me tear up even though I have watch the video a few times. Love your videos and so happy you guys are pregnant for the 2nd time. Xx
Rewatching after they announced their second pregnancy 😍
That's thee cutest reaction ever !
I'm over here with the worst case of baby fever without being able to tell my boyfriend what I'm feeling because he was always the one wanting and talking about kids and I was always the one that didn't want one. Now I'm just searching up pregnancy announcements and I wish the day it comes my boyfriend reacts this way. Congrats to you two, I hope you're happy and healthy!
Are you actually pregnant? Oh my whole heart 😭

Rewatching this after they had their kaia! So weird to think it was last year , feels like forever ago . It still makes me emotional watching gabes reaction . 😢
I cried tears of joy when watching this video.
Him crying made me cry

Gabe🥹🥺🥹i felt is as he saw the baby items
❤️
Lottery tiered up from watching this
Today I'm having a hard day and this video wow 💖 filled my soul w happiness 🌼 what an adorable couple🦋
My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for a little over 7 months and still not successful 😓 I watch this video to make me feel better
Omg his reaction had me in tears
This video popped up on my home page now that Makaiah is 4 months old and Gabe's reaction still made me sooo emotional.  Everytime you guys are blessed it fills my heart with joy cuz you both deserve it all!❤
This is so so beautiful. <3
I want this with somebody 😔
Gabe‘s reaction is a bit fake sorry to say
☝🏽🫶🏼🫵🏽🙏🏽👶🏼🫃🏻🤰🏻
crazy to think makaiah's gonna be looking back at this one day <3
I’m so happy for both of you Jess & Gab, been a fan since then ❤❤❤
Okay must be the hormones… I’m crying. His reaction was the best!!!
That's how I reacted when my wife told me she is pregnant for our first daughter. First is shock, Then confusion, Happiness for like 5 secs then fear and confusion again because I don't know to raise a child. Then change to realization and determination that this is my child and I will raise it and protect it  and make sure that she will have a good life better than I have. And then happiness and excitement. Because you starts to imagine what she will looked like. Will it look like me or my wife. And can't wait to hold it in your arms and just spend the day looking at your baby and saying I made this. This little bundle of joy and realize that life is really is a miracle. And thank God everyday for it.
wow im so happy for youu
OMGosh, I remember the video where Gabe came to see you for the 1st time. CONGRATULATIONS!! 💕💞💝
OMG I’ve BEEN WATCHING YOU SINCE LIKE FOREVER AND I WENT OFF YOUTUBE FOR A BIT AND I SEE tHIS WHEN I SEARCH JESS AND GABRIEL THIS IS OMG I’m CRYING WTHHHHHHHHHH STOP

I usually never cry at these, even during mine, but I am sobbing. I blame pregnancy hormones. You two are genuinely the sweetest souls!!!
congratulations 😀👏
The way I have been following Jess since she was single (or maybe she was already dm-ing with Gabe that time i forgot) and now I get to witness this for them, it feels like a very intimate honor to have. And now baby Makaiah is here. You booooth! <3 <3 <3
I love these people their videos I have helped me interest times where I was sad or not feeling good I teared up when they got married I cried at the going home videos and I’m crying right now I have watched this many times so excited for them they’re going to be great parents ❤
wow, its so lovely, congrats dear
Fave couple🥰💞
Okay
Not me seeing this video today and I check you guys channel and saw the video of the birth of the daughter that post 19h ago
Is anyone else noticing Jess's accent getting less Australian more American
Coming back to this after their intro of Makaiah😭🥹🤍
literally sobbing
I’m not crying your crying 🥲😭
I love you guys so I’m pregnant to I’m 10 weeks
Who’s here after she gave birth??😭😭 god bless you guys and our cute little babygirl Makaiah🧿🤍

I teared up a bit and got really emotional when she told Gabriel and Gabriel was shocked. I feel heavenly. I don't even know you guys but it made me so happy to see you happy.
I’ve been watching these videos since 2016 and I have to say, this has to be one of my fave partner reactions. You got him so off guard with the matching PJs.. it’s like you could see his whole future flash before his eyes when he saw the booties. So precious!
Now baby is here ♥️
the fact that I’ve been seeing your blogs for all these years from the long distance, to the proposal to now a lil babyy AAAAA IM SO EXCITED FOR YOU GUYS!!!

Hahahaha rewatching this “I know I’m going to pee my pants when it comes to doing this” …foreshadowing
Congratulations on your new baby! I just wanted to also add, do your research on Christmas. It is a pagan holiday, not biblical and celebrating it is considered to be idolatry. Jeremiah 10 KJV
The way I teared up
Congrats! You deserve the best!
🎉 congratulations‼️💕
this is probably the 5th time I'm watching this and I still get emotional. 🥺❤
I know u not gonna read this but I had to write this anyways … I was watching your vlogs since u met .. and then I been lost in Tik tok and just not watch any video on youtube but I saw a couple on Tik tok that reminds me of u and I was „oh wait lemme check their vlogs, maybe they are already going to have a baby“  and then I saw this .. it’s already for month u upload this .. and I am here crying because I am so happy for u. And I realize I missed watching ur vlogs 🥹 ..  Wish u all the best in life with ur baby 👶🏻 and now I am going to watch the reveal video 😍  Take care of u guys! And have a wonderful pregnancy Jess! 🥰

Blessings to your family😇 I told my husband five days after I found out. Im 10weeks pregnant and im so grateful. The Lord blessed us 😇
I stumbled across this and was trying to figure out where I’d seen you before- it was that goofy “Everything She does is magic” video your husband did about your accent years ago!  I’m so happy to find out you’re married and having a baby in real life! 😄
He got so emotional.... Awww🥺🥺

Psalm 37:4-5  4 Enjoy serving the Lord.     And he will give you what you want. 5 Depend on the Lord.     Trust him, and he will take care of you.  I believe that God's timing is best and our timing and God's timing is totally different cause He wants what is  best for His Children if we learn to be patient and wait on the Lord He will send us His blessings that   we could not even imagine God bless you keep on serving the Lord and spread the Gospel. Jesus loves you. ❤

Congrats I saw the upload and I started crying the baby is gonna be happy with the parents cause you are the two most caring people
So beautiful.😢 All my boys are grown.  Makes me wish to start over.  I remember telling my husband.  He was so calm .  He did not seem very excited.  His coworkers said he was smiling all day and telling everyone that he was going to be a Dad !! He was so happy !!  I think he was just stunned when I told him.  He is a very calm person anyway. So happy for y’all. 💜 Enjoy every single second.  Before you know it your baby will be grown.  Time flies. 🌼

His reaction is so sweet 🥺🥺🥺
Sooo Happy for you both !!!!! You will be great parents ❤
Congrats Jess & Gabe♥️♥️  Love you😘😘😘
Yes I am also 5 months pregnant
No having kids is selfish. We live in a sick world full of wars toxicity and the human race is going nowhere. People are free and do not have to make babies. No more priests knocking on your door like in the 50s and before asking to procreate. No one owes their parent's grandchildren. No one asked to be born. You never know what illness a child can have. It's reality. It's not a joke. It's not an opening to post pics of your offsprings on social media like a irresponsible imbecile, which no one really cares about.
congratulations guys !! SO HAPPY FOR YOU ☺️💟
THIS WAS THE BEST REVEAL !!! so simple but sweet 💗💫
I don't show emotion very well, Gabe had me looking for the person cutting onions though I wont even lie, Ive been around since the dating an traveling phase. So happy for the both of you  congratulations!
Oh my goodness Jess! That is exactly what I did for my husband when I told him we were pregnant with our 2nd baby 🥰 I bought a pair of little booties from target to show him 🤭 It was for Father's day and I put them in a small little gift bag as a present that said Happy Father's Day 💙 🙏 🤲
I love you both so so much, congratulations ❤️❤️
Watching knowing you get to watch someone’s life completely change for the better & know they have no idea a miracle is coming 🥺 gets me every time.
Hits million so fast, Like they all wanted you two to be pregnant, 😋.

Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
my entire heart is melting AWWW :') so happy for y'all
Been following you since forever & this teared me up so much. Congratulations to both of you. I love you so much!!! <3

NEXT telling your families!!!!!
I love you both so much! I cried watching this! 🤎🤎🤎🤎 Congrats!
So raw and perfect
Why pregnant videos get trending in Australia? There is always 2-3 women getting pregnant! Lol
Who watches this absolute garbage content? Surely it’s mostly kids??
Oh my goodness I got so emotional and in tears!!!! It would be a dream come true to see my future husband's reaction to telling him that I'm pregnant! The best part is seeing them cry and emotional because guys don't cry and aren't as emotional as girls so when you make them emotional, that is a very special thing.
such a precious reaction and a beautiful momentcongratulations!
Aww
Gabe saying "we're gonna have a baby" broke me
"it's very weird I feel like I need to tell people."
Some day I hope to have a woman tell me she is pregnant and im going to be a dad I'm 42 and losing hope this is wonderful
Gabe's reaction when he realized 🥺❤
I wanted to make a joke but then I saw Gabe’s reaction and I completely melted into mush 😅 congratulations to you guys!

Staunton City Council Unanimously Passed Resolution Condemning Forced Organ Harvesting The city council of Staunton unanimously passed a similar resolution on October 14, 2021, two weeks ahead of schedule. Mayor Andrea Oakes thanked local Falun Gong practitioners in her speech for educating the community about the issue. She said she had communicated with Virginia State Delegate John Avoli about the resolution. Mr. Avoli expressed his support for the resolution, as well as Vice Mayor Mark Robinson.  During the council meeting, the sponsor of the resolution, Councilwoman Carolyn Dull, spoke about how local residents should pay attention to forced organ harvesting in China and avoid unknowingly participating in this type of organ transplants. She thanked local practitioners for their effort. She believes that everyone should stand up and oppose China’s state-sponsored forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience.
See my music
Welp this one got me just as much as Jess’ reaction🥺😭 so sweet! Oh so happy and excited for you guys!
Im 4 months along now and just yesterday it feels like I found out too.

Its crazy how fast the pregnancy flies, I wonder when the baby is due? Maybe around when my little girl Lily is 🥺😇🙏
wow so beautiful and young  having a baby what are kids thinking these days enjoy your life while you're young for the next 18 years you'll see what I mean, and you wish you had those days back. Babies shouldn't have babies you're in the prime of your life And to be tied down I just don't get it, Oh well good luck.

Schön wenn er überlegt, ob er nun weglaufen soll oder so tun als würde er sich freuen.
hey guys go check out my nationals vlog!!
I visited this channel after a long time today ... To see this ... Like WHY AM I CRYING?!?
Watching again & crying again 💗💗
Congratulations you guys! 🥰 Our baby boy was just born at the end of January this year and it still doesn't quite feel real. I know he is my son, but it just hasn't quite sunk in that I have a baby boy of my own. We waited to tell family and friends we were pregnant until we were 13 weeks along and it felt like those weeks went by at a snails pace. After that, it felt like the weeks flew by! Jess, enjoy the personal moments you have to just you and your little one. Even with all the moving and kicking, it was still oh so magical to have that experience with you wherever you go. You guys have such a beautiful family and I'm so excited for you and your little blessing of a miracle. God bless 💙💜

Never has a "telling my husband I'm pregnant" video made me as emotional as this one you guys! I've been following you from before you even got married, you have always been my favorite YT couple, so sweet, genuine and fun! As we are so used to seeing Gabe be funny and make jokes it is so weird and emotional to see you both get emotional, haha!  Precious! Congrats ❤️

I AM SOBBING I LOVE YOU GUYS THANK YOU AGAIN FOR SHARING THESE MOMENTS WITH US
Congrats
Okay so I just watched this and I cried 😭.  I meant this just remind me when I first found out I was pregnant after trying for almost 14 years. There is not such better feeling than that. Congratulations to both 😍
I've been watching your videos since like a very2 long time ago, seeing you two finally getting ready to have a baby is so heartwarming. Congratulations 💛
Hellooo, I'm a casual fan of you two, it's been years now but I still find myself checking out and watching your videos from time to time. I just wanted to share the love and congratulate your family, you've come a long way. I'm sure you'll be amazing parents. Soo happy for you two!
Gabes reaction was everything and more 🥺🥰
We know what they did on Valentines day 😂, The baby’s probably going to be born in November which means they’re a Scorpio !!!! ♏️
Are you afraid of death?  Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
i’m legit crying in my school parking lot before class i can’t rn , congratulations!!!

The way Gabe kept on looking at her stomach and smiling knowing that their baby is in there🥺😭💜
4:47 his expression is what's referred to in nature as "fight or flight" but this is irrelevant because humans can't fly. #themoreyouknow
I have watched hundreds of reactions.. NEVER have I immediately had crocodile tears running down my face the SECOND the guy finds out. This was so precious. I wish you all the very best and most blessing filled path to parenthood. God bless.

Hi
This is so sweet! You're going to be amazing parents❤
For some reason I thought she had gotten a matching onesie or baby something when she showed the pjs
This is so beautiful 😭🥺
the best future parents ever 🥺💛✨ I was under the impression that you didn’t film Gabe’s reaction and I was like “oh cool that’s okay! because this is their moment and if they happened to not film it, that’s 100% okay :,)” so this REALLY caught me off guard and i’m just as happy AGH LOVE YOU GUYS THANK YOU 🥺🌟💌💌💌

GABRIELS REACTIONNNN im crying bye- nah imma jus 😗✌️
when we found out for the first time we were pregnant I was in shock and also felt like the sun was shining on me! it is a precious time and from one parent to another soak this in and try to listen to your own hearts and don’t focus on the world. becoming a parent is beautiful and a very big adjustment. so may people will give you advice & the hardest part is to trust your own gut. pray like crazy and brave for the biggest adventure of your life! congratulations and blessings for you and your baby as you grow! 💗
sweetest reaction ever, are you kidding me?! love y'all and wishing for a safe pregnancy and delivery :)

Okay so apart from this being cute as hell and his reaction was beautiful. How damn cute was milo when Gabriel started to cry after his reaction!! It’s like milo knew. He was sniffing the socks and sniffing Gabriel as if to check if he’s okay. So damn cute!!!💗

❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is so precious and so beautiful! Thank you for sharing!
I was waiting for this!!
his face when he first opened his eyes.. PRICELESS!!!😭😭
Im all sniffly now. I know Gabe is gonna be such an amazing father.  The warmth of his soul and his humor just reminds me of my Dad and Grandfather. They were the warmest and most loving parents I could have asked for.  I miss them most so much
😭😭😭😭😭😭 literally the sweetest reaction!
i balled my eyes out when gabirel had that look in his eyes
I gave myself a talk before clicking on the video. I told myself not to cry… SO WHY AM I CRYING
Knew it theyre gonna cut this video short. The family part will be coming soon where they tell about the pregnancy to their family and friends. All youtubers do that split it in 2 parts make more views, no offence love you guys
It is such a privilege to be given even snippets of moments of some of the most magical parts of your lives. I’ve never been so excited for two people I’ve never met before. Praying for all 4 of you (Milo of course too) during this incredible journey in your lives. Loving these videos so so much! 🤍
This got me crying
Congratulations 🎆🎇👏

So sweet! I kinda wish I’d have filmed my positive test, but it was a different story for me. When I got the positive test I cried for an hour… not really happy tears. My husband and I had been married for 4 months and still had known each other for less than a year and we had hoped to wait a bit, get more established together. But God had other plans. Now we are so excited. But it would have been interesting if I had filmed my initial reaction.
The way I started crying immediately after you handed him the little shoes, I'm so happy for you guys <3
I had to rewatch Gabriel’s reaction over & over. The sweetest, greatest reaction 🥺🤍
My favorite couple 🥰🙏🥺

Oh my heart is so full, Gabe's reaction is so sweet. I can't wait till you guys have the baby
I'm so happy or you gys. Literally just started singing, "So happy for them," over and over lol
I think the best part of this situation is the timing. A couple vlogs back they discussed the break from social media with Gabe’s tough season that he was going through, struggling with his identity/purpose and now he has the best purpose! This is so special and I’m sooooo happy for you guys!!! Congrats guys!!!
gabe's reaction is so precious im🥺🥺🥺🥺

Huge congratulations to you both. This is so exciting for you 2. I really hope and pray you guys have a very healthy baby.

i'm not lying when i say this is the most precious and pure reaction i've ever seen from anyone in these kinda video's. he looked so surprised and so genuinely happy, it made my heart melt. God bless you and your precious little baby, you're gonna be the best parents ever <33
Gabe’s reaction is a 💎. You can see it in his eyes, how happy and delighted he is of the news. It just felt like he just got an answered prayer which he was desperately asking the Lord for. May God bless your growing family. It’s just amazing how I’ve been here since the first video you uploaded in this channel. Being part of the journey from being boyfriend and girlfriend, from being engaged, married, Going home to Australia after years of not being able to, Gabe’s battle towards depression and how he was able to overcome it, in Jesus name, and now this. I am just so happy for the both of you. May God’s favor and blessing continue to flow and praying for Jess’ safe pregnancy and for a very healthy baby. Love youuuu
