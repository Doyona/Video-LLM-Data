2 years later, and Upamecano is the best CB in the world
Upmencanu really had stinkers in both legs.
Upa out Kim in
Jamal musiala is better than de bruyne
Jamaal musiala is better than de bruyne
(Whispers) “kimmich come to cityyy 🤫”
Sane did his best for man city. True hero!
watching the replay of the Bayern penalty it bounces up off Akanjis foot what is he meant to do really is a joke 😂
Umpemecano is terrible player
I see Haaland's penalty lessons with Harry Kane have paid off.
Upmecano is so overrated
i dont believe that upmecano wasn't paid
What is everyone on that was a clear penalty for Bayern, the bias is crazy 😂
Even Tuchel was laughing at that Bayern penalty
When people say all Haaland does is score goals i just shake my head. If anyone thinks all he does is score goals, go watch him play live.
Harry maguire and de gea must have studied both yan and upemecano performances from the 1st leg then did their best to emulate them agains sevilla 😂.
Bro this game was rigged af
How long has those offside visuals been like that?
What a BS red card
Honestly I don't really think Bayern did enough for a draw. Sorry.
Upamaguire 😂😂 He's had an absolute stinker in both legs.. for the penalty, why put your hands behind your back right up until when he hits the ball for it to hit your hand??
english commentators are so bitter haha
Wait till the charges of crimes over 100 come tumbling down on Man C. Relegation.
if we dont sign a clinical striker by next season we might actually lose the bundesliga
City shouldn’t have won that yellow card complete red
Haaland, has a bad game by his standards and still scores
Bayern Pen for that , Come on
John Stones is one of the most Underrated players in the world. FACT.
Good to see City in their traditional yellow and black.  I don't know why it is they turn out in blue and white sometimes. Is that a laundry issue?
upamecano😂
love haalands reaction to the red card and then it being overturned loooool
Upmecano is Mancunian
That blk defender is the main reason Man City even won the game
Why would City loan out Cancelo to Bayern? Wtf
Bring bak sane
If man city want to win the championship they haft to get a past real midird
they’re winning it 😅
I’m still not convinced about the first pen did it even touch the hand
Haaland gives city the counter attacking option which they’ve not had since 2018 2019
Dodgy Arab money won the day fir Man city .Sadly money wins not a Manc in their team .
Haalands passion is unreal.
Haaland aiming for the bayern fan with his missed penalty 😂😂
Never a penalty at all
What a bog ref
wow Haaland missed a pen , he must be human
Everyone assumed and knew that Upamecano was not mentally fit since the first leg for a champions league match at this level but yet Tuchel  decide otherwise for reasons beyond logic and Bayern paid an heavy price . I feel bad for Bayern to have fallen this low with such an impressive team but look no further than Upamecano he was a disaster a tragic one. He is not at a Maguire level just the own goals missing but the rest is all coming to places, Please get rid of him...
Was Man City trying to look like Borussia Dortmund with that outfit?
So money can buy success.
both penalties were just ridiculous decisions, what a nonsense. Get back to deliberate handball, defenders van put their arms to use for balance etc. I am heartily sick of VAR ruined the game what a farce.
Terrible commentary as per 😂
UpaMaguire
Last 20 poor min in Manchester cost Bayern...both pen in Munich were laughable...
Come on city ❤🎉
Yet again European refs do not know how referee a important game  they just want to be in the spotlight.
two poor sides.  so many errors
Has Haalands penalty landed yet
Have City at last spent enough to buy the CL
I'm sorry but the ref was unfair🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤡🤡
Despite the loss, We still OUTSUNG City tourists. Amazing🔴🔴⚪⚪🔥🔥👌👌
That Bayern penatly decision is an absolute disgrace to the sport...EVERYONE, including the Bayern players know that was never a penatly in  a million years yet these idiotic officials plow on regardless and award them. Truley outrageous.
Why wasn't it a penalty. Biased unprofessional British commentators.
Good game Man City played well wish I was noticed
Lost out on 30 quid because of that Bayern goal what a joke that penalty decision was
Just kick it at there arms in area....guaranteed penalty-    som of these are crazy----
I wish these officials had been in charge at the City Ground last week! Maguire's handball far more obvious than either of the ones given here.
Instead of sacking football managers 1 Dock the players wages 2 if they don’t put in the hours of training and effort on the pitch , drop them from the team and reduce the wage to 50%
800000 views and only 8.8k likes?!!!
Is the Prem's handball rule different to UEFA's? Arsenal should've had a last min pen against Newcastle if Bayern's was a pen
As a Liverpool fan, i've stopped caring if Man City win every trophy in the world, as they've been far more dominant and lucky then us in the last five years.
Upamecano is shocking
Be a good game man city vs real Madrid am not a city supporter but hope they go on and win the champions league.
I think Real Madrid will beat them.
*Upamaguire!*
That was never a penalty hahah they actually felt bad for Bayern
💯 backing city to go all way
I like citeh , noel an Liam support them and villa legend Grealish plays for them so I hope they win the champions league ... but watching haaland and citeh players celebrating what they thought was a red card against bayern was not good to see ... very wanky behavior in my opinion... minor gripe , think this season is the one
Upmecano is the most dodgy defender I’ve ever seen 😂 he’s literary like Bambi on ice
Haaland scores more goals in half a season than I do in a full season of beginner career in fifa
Ref is a city fan eww
Haaland is unbelievable 🔥
Upamencano has been disgraceful lately
Ok own up - who let the idiot name the YouTube videos? 😂
Pep buying refs once again
When Haaland missed the pen the city assistant manager was in shock 😂
how can they say the bayern penalty isn't a pen??? his arm literally blocks the cross...
😮😮😮
Yann sommer is a beast if only upomecano could defend 😂😂😂
All Goals(since joining): Nunez 21 - 50 Haaland   PL Goals: Nunez 9 - 32 Haaland.   CL Goals: Nunez 4 - 12 Haaland
cant wait to see man city lose to real madrid again
As a city fan I've never been to quick to jump the gun and say we will win the CL, however this is now our best chance to really go for it, I'd love nothing more than big ears to grace the etihad we more than deserve it
I’m pretty sure that I would have a better performance than upermuncano😂😭
Idk what they complaining about city literally got a penalty that was the exact same thing 😂
What a great game. And what a counter attack from City that penalty decision was beyond pathetic.
Haarland glitched for moment 🤖😂 cmon city 👏🏼
Im sorry but this new handball is so childish! there's nothing that he could do in that situation
MAN CITY well played keep up the good work 😁💙
At last City are getting some champions league good fortune
That Bayern pen 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think Bayern needs to bring back that ball sniffing manager!
Akanji has no excuse for that handball. How dare he use his hands for balance. Needs to chop both arms off
Poor upamecano and his knock knees. Little bits of poo in his knickers.
Alf weidersen not laughing now Bayern Munich
F'off... He clearly had his arm in an unnatural position, defo Penalty!!! Embarrassing people think otherwise tb blunt!!!!!!!
That ref really wanted to help city. Plus that guy crying over the pen at the last minute yet said nothing over city pen...
What a season jack grealish is having such an asset for man city he's having a blinder of a season
Halland is an absolute bell end
If city eventually does win the UCL i’m done with football tbh but who cares because money is king.
That’s city’s champions league over
Someone told me Upamecano is a better defender than Silva
it was nice of haaland to miss that pen
Tuchel getting sent off is a really bad look. I was rooting for him but he clearly hasn’t learnt from his past mistakes
BT commentary team once again excelling at being bias against City. It was all about how Bayern are gonna win, Bayern are great, oooo lets kiss bayern.
This handball nonsense has got to stop. It is ruining the game.
Nothing Citeh does will count.
These two games have wiped around £30mill off Upemecanos value 😂
So happy my team are in league one…..none of this var none sense…..
The handball rule is beyond a joke
Upamencano is a disgrace of a player. 🗑️🗑️🗑️
I'm Liverpool, but really want city to win cl and they will
If Bayern took there chances would been completely different game but really good match to watch  this why we love football ⚽️
He missed as it wasn't a pen , it don't touch his arm , that's what's on his mined
Coman is such a joy to watch
Upamecano Definitely didn't sleep well last night thinking about this game . He's had an absolute mare. The first 0 out of 10 performance I've ever witnessed in my life
Mite have missed a pen but he’s still Ice cold when it matters most
Bayern never stood a chance, gutted to see them out !
Upamecano was atrocious, literally cost bayern a semi-final
Upamecano has been god awful over these 2 legs 😮
AC vs Inter Milan is cool and all but the fact that only one of Madrid and City are gonna be in the finals is why the knockout format is kinda annoying.
Handball under uefa rules is different to PL handball.. Accidental handball is still handball,where as it is not in PL
Cheating frauds.
Madrid are a different animal,,,, I can't wait
No way an Arabian commentator said Upamaguire during the game😂😂
So glad halaand scored after missin that pen .
Dont know what the issue is. That 100% a pen
2 absolutely shocking penalty decisions. Something needs to be done about the officiating and VAR. absolute shambles
Another ref who ouldnt give a decent decision if it hit him in the face neither one of those penalties is EVER EVER EVER handball .an absolute joke
Referee was a disgrace
What a bizarre game!
Upamaguire
so Harland is human after all 😀
I was very disappointed no bayern fan or player knocked unconscious erling haaland out with a serious brain injury
Think City will win it this time finally
Why’d the cameraman point to the stands for Kimmich pen 😂😂😂
City are red hot favourites for the CL now.
I think Upmecano has been absolutely terrible! What on earth was he doing in this tie?
Halland celebrates he got someone sent off... Snake
That was a terrible penalty miss, I am not sure how he can cope with Real Madrid.
Well the next games cud B described as two CL’s final no disrespect to the Milan teams but the winnner of RM MC shud B lifting old big ears 👂 the big ? Is it going be Citeh’s first or RM’S 15th 🤔 I said I think it’s going to be City’s finally at start of the year but RM even when they don’t play well they grind out the results even if it’s just their GK having a blinder so I really don’t know who’S going to come out on top if City don’t win maybe they r cursed in this comp as they got a class striker who’s going to finish with probably 60 goals scored this season🙄 Ps anybody know Y Neurer or Gnabry not play I’m guessing injuries 🤔
How was that a pity penalty? It’s a hand ball 😂
Haaland man 🇧🇼💙
City this time favorites they will win ucl
For us neutrals.. we have two unbelievable semi finals coming up! Can't wait
Those penalties used to be called ball to hand
The build up to this was, in the UK by the way, talk sport , or five live . beefing Bayern up to make it look interesting, Stewart pearce  actually said Bayern were not to bad in the last game,  what game was he watching, they were f dreadful , for a start like last night the defending was  dreadful and there crossing and delivery of passes no better, wake up.
Haaland owns bayern
..: woo
Upamaguire put in a great performance for City
Upamecano with an exceptional display of disastrous footballing. Would not even make Sunday League of those performances. Quite the shambles.
Common sense has gone out of the window, no way that was a penalty
Ref had a shocker
Halaand is soooooo funny, got that goal back and said WHAT to the Bayern fans, can even see Pep loves it hahaha
Nice😂😢😮😊
So who has the biggest envelopes , Madrid or City ?
If the Upamancano incident was a penalty then tbh he had to give the penalty to Bayern… Both stupid decisions imo
How can the commentators? Think that the Man City pen was ok to give but the Bayern penalty wasn’t? Idiots
Bayern really missing that cutting edge striker
As a Man Utd fan, I am glad we never signed Upemecano. Phil Jones is better.
Upamaguire
The manager of city, he is so serious! More serious than my father 😂
City Till I Die.
joke pen at the end
These handball pens are a joke!!! Was fuming...what are the players suppose to bloody do cut their arms off or what...
Need to get rid of Tuchel, second rate manager. Plus need a replacement for Upamecano and Mane, bring in some young German talent.
Was all about the ref. Loving the attention.
Haaland misses a penalty? He did it deliberately, just to show he's human.
Farmer boys got farmed
Referee ticking all FIFA box's again, have they no common sense, or a brain.
Tuchel just can't keep control, he won't be manager for long
One of the worst penalty decisions I’ve seen
I don’t know who was more shambolic this game, upemecano or the ref, no way were either of them penalties, the ref giving out yellows for stupid reasons
When haaland was walking like a gangster when the red card came then realised he was offside was gold 😂
fair play to the commentators, were unbiased in their opinions and called out the horrific system of champions league handball rule.
Both penalties were ridiculous, I can’t believe that’s what constitutes a handball these days. Both non deliberate, both times the hand was in a normal position
Thats what bayern get for sacking their manager
Can we take a second to appreciate how well the referee and VAR did for once? The overturn on the red was spot on and I didn't even see the handball at first, but they did and called it right (at least in my opinion)
Cityzens 🤢
Masterpiece celebration by Halaand 😂
Does Haaland know how to pass?
Haarland celebrating a player almost being sent off when he looked around then dived into the player was disgraceful
Man city just now are just different class. They are having to up there work rate in the league so it's now showing in the UCL. The var system in the ucl is so much better too. Only way var works properly is with that system.
the handball law is encouraging bad defending. Defenders are turning their backs to avoid handball, if it wasnt for the pedantic current intepretation of the law theyd stand up staright and defend properly.
The one thing Haaland can't do, take penalties. Not seen one decent penalty from him all season.
Upamecano got a red card, a yellow card and 3 goal contributions for city in 2 games💀💀
That Real semi going to be fire
Upmepacno is a mistake waiting to happen
How was that not a penalty . Sack the commentator 😂
Seems like Bayern didn’t have much luck in this match.
City wow ❤. Halland, KDB, Stones, Ederson. Too complete.
Sack the ref
How much did city pay upmecano? 😂
That pen for Bayern was a perfect example of where nobody agrees with the rules. Absolute joke.
Man City will win it this year, Haaland is the key
So we can could people and get away with it if it’s offside? Just doesn’t seem fair.
I think city will finally win the champions league.
FIFA better make sure we don’t have a decision that ruins a game for one of these handball pens
Another clown show from Upamecano
Im having £100 on Real to win the champions league. That should guarantee they dont win it
Upamecano was absolutely rubbish across both legs. Honestly can’t see why people thinks he’s a top centre half. The penalty he gave away was pathetic
Man City piss this champions leauge
Same as last year and against the same opponents then - semis and out.
Things Turned to mess for Bayern Since They Sacked Nagelsman😅😅😂
The ref in this game is a joke. He wants the limelight and makes shocking decisions. Was the same in a Europa game from memory
Real vs Milan
I think L'Equipe gave Upamecano , 3 out of 10 in the first leg , this one he's likely to get minus 3!
I love it when they pan in on Oliver Kahn whenever Bayern concede 😂
I don't see why teams don't saw off their defenders arms. It's the only way to stop them conceding penalties.
So the rule in football now is that if your arms are not by your sides or behind your back then it's a penalty if someone kicks a ball into them? Surely not!
Sommer and ederson were on top form today. Great saves all round
Haaland!!!💪💪💪City!
That first goal was pure class
What is that penalty  People wonder why the premier league is best league hahaha 🤣
I'm disappointed with bayern
Upemecano is a blue!! 💙 great performance City all round
If city win the ucl this season upamecano will go down as a club legend
Watch out Real Madrid 😈
Lets just hope Madrid beat them or they will finally win the Champions league, For everything else there's Mastercard.
Upamecano played great as the Manchester City striker today
The Upamaguire pack got smoked hard by City
Ban City from the lot, make them pay
Next Real Menacing Madrid😂😂
Nice to give the Germans a last minute pity Penalty 😂
If City play against Real Madrid like they did in this game they’ll be annihilated, such a different team to last week
Chelsea should never have SACKED TUCHEL.....BAYERN were unlucky not to have won this leg outright.
Not sure why people are saying that wasn’t a pen
I’ll be exiting to watch city v real.  Both Milan.  I’m sure city v inter will be in the final
That Haaland missed penalty is shocking , he’s so bad at penalty’s 😢😢😢
Mate...I wonder how much, on both legs, upamecano got paid. Genius
It's only a matter of time before teams prioritize buying players without arms to prevent conceding so many penalties.
The law on penalties has changed - am I slow to catch on? No intent is needed. Ball to hand is not required. Arms in an unnatural position is out. Any contact with hand or arm is a pen
Ref was absolutely shocking!Completely lost control over the game.
Who won in penalty
Upamecano dropped one of the worst performances over two legs of all time.
He give this penalty only because he give even more stupid one to city .
Our Norwegian Viking
Bayern dominated ashame they couldnt finish
Upamecano shouldn’t play for Bayern again
I was not surprised at the result because I know Bayerns Coach is not up to the task.
The officials are making a mockery of our beautiful game 👎
Champions league Benzema might be the only one who can stop this city side from getting the treble
Thoughts as a city fan: Haaland is human after all Ederson very comfortable over two legs Bernardo terrorised that right wing for 180 mins That penalty is one of the worst decisions I’ve seen
Upmecano is so bad it’s unreal
Please someone make sure parland doesn't make it to the semi finals let's hope real Madrid win against city who used refs to get here and its embarrassing
Goooo City 💙💙💙💙
Goooo City 💙💙💙💙
Grealish is just class. As a united fan I cant even comprehend the level of play from both teams in this match its actually humbling
Score in title 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
I know Upamecano’s fall looked very bad, but if that were Neymar or Mbappe or even Saint-Maximin who did what Haaland did nobody would shut up about it for weeks
What I love about haalnd is that missing chances doesn't bother him in terms of confidence he just keeps going because he knows he's gonna get chances
If Bayern played like this in the first match aswell they would've won
HAALAND missed the PENALTY only to score after 🤫 sssshhhhh
Upamecano is the new McGuire! 😂
Moral of the story: Never choose Sane over Mane, you'd get knocked out.
Strikers are just going to start whacking the ball and the arms of defenders. We'll see ten penalties per match eventually.
What's happened to Upemecano? He was one of the best up coming defenders last time I remember him, had him in my fifa careers and all but now he's looking like davinson sanchez
Real Vs man city semi final will be more entertaining than the final 💀
That bayern penalty 😂.  How can u give a penalty that hits a defenders toe then his arm 😂
The ex Dortmund player managed by an ex Bayern Munich manager scores against his old rivals that are now managed by an ex Dortmund manager.  Football is a funny old game
Bundesliga players are the best penalty scorers 💯🏆.
I’m a united fan but city are gonna win it
Can they beat Madrid...... difference from last year is they have Haaland. Be a cracking game.
Tuchel is an embarrassment
Handball is a joke now.
Pitch was awful!!!
The rebuild for Tuchel begins now. Nagelsmann was evidently too much of a boy wonder for hierarchy. Tuchel has maverick qualities and is potentially a volatile figure.  Olu Igbekele Sports
Event though they are knackered Arsenal have still had it they are coming
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Well done MAN CITY congratulations great performance,  ruben Diaz and akanji , Enderson all played a EXCELLENT role 👍
Ref was a disgrace
🔥🔥🔥HAALAND VIKING 🔥🔥🔥
The Ref tries to make the game all about him he had a terrible game that was never a pen at the end
Now, only fair someone photoshops a monkey to Haalands face
Haaland low key has plot armour
I think City is gonna get the trophy this season, they look to strong. Real is still a very hard test, we all saw it last year, but last year City didn't had Haaland and I think that's the point.
UpaMaguire having a stinker of a season :((
I don’t understand the handball rule anymore, now if the ball gets smashed at your hand from less than a yard away it’s foul play 🤷‍♂️
Upamecano played really well for City. He really tried his best to get them a goal tonight.
Man City vs Milan final in Istanbul then
Hope they get it tyt this time
Mane kicked it at Sissokos arm on purpose didn’t he in that final…  That’s not football.
What was that Man City penalty for …? That’s not a handball.. barely touched him. Defender two foots his own player… that’s a foul.
This is the best team ever Man City had and of they beat Madrid they should be favourites.
City have ruined football
Munich keeper kept them in it in Manchester should of been 6.
For all the stick Maguire gets, Upa should be seeing equal treatment.  Terrible defender in a top side.  Was awful for France in the WC too
If anyone has any advice on how I can improve my videos it would mean a lot
Looks like cheats do prosper after all
Ref was on his arrrs
I just have a this feeling inside that Madrid will score a last gasp winner and just do what Madrid do so much in the champions league
Oopsamecano
Upamecano.....get me on the pitch
Amapiano is too medi
Mané managed to get a handball in the champs league final against Tottenham by blasting it against his opponent's arm. It works.
Holy cow, what a car crash of officiating this match was
HAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!
what a stadium
Never in this world a penalty, Mane kicked it that fast onto his arm.
That Upamecano is a big weakness in that Bayern team.
As soon as mane comes on a goal✍️ Thomas tuchel what is he thinking.
These needless kit changes have to stop. FIFA and UEFA must put a ban on this; it's out of control now and ruining a major part of the match experience.
RM will somehow find a way to win against City even if City dominate overall
upamecano harry maguire of bayern😅
Big mistake sacking Naggelsman
Real Madrid winning this again
I think the upamecano one is a penalty because he’s blocking a shot and has no reason to have his arm out, but I don’t think the akanji one is as he was running and where his arm was is completely natural for someone who’s been running and he obviously doesn’t have time to move it due to the distance
Upamecano 🙈
Ever since that women commentator said Bernardo Silva isn’t well known for taking people on and beating defenders, all I’ve seen him do is take people on and beat defenders😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️
Worse pen than kanes in the world cup lol
Lol nice pen😂
Looks like Refs will be helping City to win this year
Haaland is the new version of cristiano ronaldo.
Still not convinced by city , a better team with better finishers would have scored tonight . I don't think Madrid will be so forgiving.
0:10 no one can tell that guy in the suit isn’t from fifa 23
Bayern really need to invest in a groundskeeper, don't know if it was some tactic to put city off their game as it seemed more of their players slipped but I'm glad it resulted in a goal
City won't beat Madrid in the semi final Madrid are just on another level when it comes to UCL
VAR and the referee doing the show the first goal for Manchester City wasn't penalty penalty is the most ridiculous decision why the referee don't go and look the monitor and make his own decision?
Another Solid performance from city hope they win the champs
If only Haaland didn’t miss that penalty, it would’ve made a ‘huge’ difference to the score, like with Kane at the World Cup when he missed a penalty against France.
Real Madrid  will  hammer u
Same come to Utd and u will destroy City next season
Upemacano is the new jerome boateng 😂
Difference between small club Bytching Punych and Real Madrid is Madrid can score 2 goals in 2 minutes when they need to while puny little Punych can't even score 3 in 90 minutes. The biggest disgrace of European football Bytching Punych are.
Nice to see small club Bayern getting put in their place by a real quality side. Nothing more satisfying to watch! The ultimate frauds of Europea  football Bayern. Win 10 domestic puppy titles in a league that doesn't even deserve to be called a leage other than simply 'Bayern Liga' and yet can never defend the champions league even once and still think they are one of Europe's heavyweights? The biggest joke I've ever encountered LMFAO
Sane and Coman are two absolutely brilliant and electric dribblers, all they are missing at bayern is a strong striker and they are in for business on the goal scoring side next season
Upamecano has to be joking. Defender version of Karius. Tuchel wants to kill himself
The winner of the Man City-Real Madrid tie should be the Champions League winners. They were the two best sides going into the quarters and they're still the best two sides.   The Milan sides shouldn't be good enough to win it. Be a bad day for football if one of the Milan sides wins it.
African maguire strikes again !
Manchester City 4 Upemecano 1 😊
As a planet earth fan, the stadium felt like an Adolf rally.
‘Bizarre circumstances’ that Bayern penalty, even though the ball was going into the box if it didn’t hit his hand
4-0 up on the 82'nd minute and the commentator complaining about a Bayern penalty. Shows the mindset of the English.  Be a different story if Tuchel didn't take over at Bayern.
Upamecano is garbage
Not that it would have made a difference but the officials only adding 2 minutes of injury time in the first half really annoyed me..
Did Sane go off for Mane ? 😅
whatever happened to "ball to hand"
upamecano wasnt in the game
Worst decisions ever... what are we doing to the beautiful game???
6:34 i thought u cant stutter on a penalty anymore? Even after this rediculous hand ball call
Who changed the Rules in Football ..never handball
Both penalties were soft but that bayern one, deary me. Imagine if that's the last minute of the champions league final and that gets given?  They need to sort it out this handball rule, it's getting ridiculous now
I wonder how much Upmecano got payed for these two games 😂
Both of those penalty decisions were terrible. Like the commentators said, if either of those has been called in a champions league final, there would be outrage
Tell me if they should start Nuer again
Don’t know why hoodle upset var correct I believe if it hit ur arm it penalty same rule for offside if u off u off this not interfering with play lot of rubbish just like var let the ref and linesman get on with it
Every time I see upmecano play against any decent side he’s a complete mess😂😂😂
that handball is so ridiculous
Liverpool fan. But I’m rooting for city to win the champions league and knock them Real Madrid wa*kers out. City is a top top team with class players and manger. Liverpool 🤝 city
Never let this referee manage a game ever again.
Leroy Sane is an absolute disgrace both on and off the pitch
10+ years of pumping oil money into City might just bring them their first CL trophy..   or will it..?
Where was the nearly own goal? We missed in the game and on the replys...
Yo I heard Sane and Mane had a bust up 😂
The way silva just glides through players with his technical ability and low sense of gravity is mesmerising to watch fantastic player, City will miss him alot if he leaves
Perfect example of being in a defenders head
hot take but laporte should be sent of has his arms on the neck of the player that's a yellow brings him done dunno what to say 🤣
I am not a city fan and I hope they go out next round but that 2nd penalty wasn’t a penalty. Come on now…football nowadays is a joke
What Bayern Munich see in Tuchel is beyond me, he's a raving lunatic.
How is bayerns goal a penalty 😂😂😂
Man city will beat real madrid this time my prayers are accepted ameen respect 💯💯💯💙💙💙
Upamaguire
Hurling Allen That is all
Well this is where the journey ends for City, they better focus on the league. Madrid are too good.
Everyone get ready for another clash of the two best teams in the world  Real Madrid and Man City
Upaenmancaooooo upaenmencanooooo jokes aside he’s been horrific these past two games sheesh Sane should’ve of scored City’s teams are just too good
VAR gets more stupid by the day. These kinds of decisions make a mockery of the game. Football is the most punitive, neurotic sport on the planet, and VAR, plus the dumbfcks who make the absurd rules, are destroying our beautiful game.
Anyone listening to the radio commentary of this will agree with me that this sounded like pure chaos for the whole 90 mins 😂
imagine people thinking city are going to thrash real madrid
Football is dying, both pens were a joke.
Upamaguire
Celebrating an opponent’s red card like that at 3-0 up is crazy to me ngl. That’s why he’s missed that first pen.
Ta Ta  Fritz
Handball is now a joke. I miss the days when refs had to decide intention. These super-slowmo decisions on whether the arm was within silhouette is a bad bad joke that ultimately didn't really affect tonight's qualification. But as a Spurs fan...I've seen in the final, having a ball pelted at an outstretched arm ain't a fun watch
But can they beat Real?
Penalty against Man City was a complete joke! VAR and refereeing has never been worse than it is now.
I'm starting to hate this game. 😆 Penalty! Come on man! I can stand City and it isn't nothing but, what the hell!
3:15 if sane goes down - penalty for Bayern
Upmecano giving off big Davinson Sanchez vibes over the two legs
Massive difference in class unfortunately Bayern couldn't compete
For the good of football,  Real Madrid must beat the corrupt cheats. It'll be a travesty for Man City to have their hands on that prestigious trophy.
Upamecano must be Maguire best friend
Both pens are disgraceful
Upmecano with 10/10 match fixing in both legs😂😂😂
Upemaca - needs to go blud
Bayern offered nothing... Poor team outclassed, outranked and outplayed by a far superior team! Good luck in the next round to Citeh, where they will not be facing such a poor team like Bayern demonstrated they are this season.
Unfortunately for us real madrid are just too good in the CL 😢
Everyone talking about how bad Upamecano is - sorry, but I'm still just completely baffled by those handball decisions. Embarrassing from the officials.
Tuchel should never have got the job
"Cityzens" isn't a thing 😂
0:05 😮 scary 😲
Absolutely love the hype around this city side at the moment, and how everyone is on their knees for them. It will make it that much greater when Madrid dump them out the competition, AGAIN.
That look on Bayern owner face 😂 Karma for unfairly sacking Nagelsmann. He's smiling at home 😅
City have worn that awful away kit far too many times this season
Jesus is Lord ✝️❤️
how is that a penalty, insanity
Real Madrid Vs. AC Milan in the final...
Is it the end of the world all champions have been eliminated who will be champion mancestr sitydon't say it's not
Sane greasiness cost Bayern alongside mistakes made by their defence
Tuschel will get the sack by end of season. He is declining as a top manager
Upamecano is the worst defender.  In both legs he's shown he has 0 football IQ in terms of defending.  He's only ability is athleticism.  Other than that, he's terrible.  Put him against any decent forward an it's over.
The ref was smoking that zaza tonight
5:02 😂 Halland
Gotta thank our 12th man on the pitch “Upamecano” 👏🏾
I have to say Coman impresses me whenever I watch him in Europe
City v Madrid and Inter v Milan. Kinda wish Bayern made it through but they are both great games
Two of the most rediculous penalties ever given. How on earth was the City player ment to avoid the ball when it is kicked right at him from point blank range. The refs are total morons who have no idea that this is an athletic game where arms cannot be at your sides at all times.
Upamecano turned into The Legend HARRY MAGUIRE.
When City wore yellow and black I thought they would bottle this game like classic Dortmund, Haaland probably thought for one moment when he missed that pen that he was playing for Dortmund again. But fair play, professional job on the night.
Upamaguire
I personally had a lot of change in emotion for this match.
Molar 😂
upamecano had 20 quid on Haaland to score first goal
Haaland should have scored 3
Upmecano is so bad
Bruh my £0.25p accumulation for a win of £4,000 was cancelled by that penalty wow!
What laporte disat the end of the game is what chalobah should have done to rodrygo last night
When will people stop trying to make ‘Cityzens’ work?
City should buy Upamecano and loan him to whichever team they think is their biggest rival next season
Handball rules desperately need to be re-written. Players are being punished for the crime of having arms.
I think Madrid will beat city again lol
My obs...thank goodness Lee Roy scuffed that early one, a goal for them then would have made for a different game; both penalty decisions were nonsense; will UEFA take a close look at the objects thrown at Erling after he scored - and act accordingly? A fine is due, at least, for that.
let’s be honest they not beating Real 😮
The handball laws are lo longer fit for purpose. Upamecano has to try and defend with his arms behind his back, an arm drops away for balance and it’s a penalty. For the next one that arm is not in an unnatural position. In trying to standardise decision making for VAR and to satiate all the people who scream for consistency they have made the laws a farce.
Upamecano is an accident on legs, surely the worst performance over 2 legs from a single player, almost single handedly took Man City to the semi
As an arsenal fan watching this....the pain.....
Bayern so wasteful.
6:34 Lewandowski’s style penalty.
We kinda miss ribery roben muler klose etc.. no?
Dear UEFA  Please let us form a European super League so we can actually have a league/tournament that has competitive match ups unlike this garbage we're stuck with now   Yours sincerely Football fan
If there's one goal-scorer better than Haaland it's VARLAND !!  That rule is so FUP it's beyond belief paid professional officiation body can be so stupid. Neither penalty was warranted but then the issue of interpretation remains irrespective of technology...
I remember people absolutely raving about Upamecano before he signed for Bayern, I know he's had some decent games but he makes so many mistakes
What a game it's going to be with Madrid
City make everything boring, can't wait for them to be in the championship next season
Don't think that handball by either was much of a pen, first pen for Man city hardly deflected the ball, and the one for bayern was a deflection of the foot up at the player, so neither were worthy of being pens
Akanji has his arm off the pitch, and they give a penalty. VAR is a shambles
Arsenal getting spanked on Wednesday , if they beat city to the title . Arteta will deserve a knighthood even though he’s Spanish
Why the commentators moaning at the penality? Man City get penalities all the time, when it shouldn't have been a pen!
bernardo silva🤩🤩
Great goal. Lovely lay off by Haaland from Stones to De Bruyne  then watch Haaland move to receive the pass, dance round the defender and smash it in past the keeper. Best goalscorer in the World.
...Real Madrid needs to put karma again back to place...
How insane would it be for Real Madrid to knock out Liverpool, Chelsea and Man City again for the second year in a row. 😂
How that's a penalty for Bayern I have no idea..
Upamecano makes Harry Maguire looks like a prime Maldini 😂😂😂
Upamecano wants to play for city so bad
City must can overcome Madrid let's see what they can do
Some bizarre penalty decisions now
As a Utd fan it pains me to say but I really do think City are gonna lift the trophy, Pep boils my blood rotten bastd. cheat.
Bayern's penalty was  more a penalty than City's.
It now has to be conceded. Dayot Upamecano is an utterly diabolical football player. Atrocious in every sense of the word. An embarrassment to Bayern Munich.
neither were penalties, glad they didn't affect the result
Congratulations city!
Even though i want City to win, that was a clear as day penalty for bayern😂 how tf is the commentator and other people saying otherwise idk lol. His hand was out and blocked the trajectory of the ball simple as that, the City penalty on the other hand could have been argued against as it barely affects the spin and trajectory of the ball but City had the aggregate so i dont really care too much haha
Sacking nagelsmann  makes sense now 😂😂😂
Just a big oil club, no history lmao
For me Bayern we’re the main threat of the competition but we got the job done at the etihad 1st leg. We didn’t need to attack tonite just see the tie through. That is not the same Bayern side that has dominated teams before. Madrid have stopped us twice we stop them this time. The question is which milan side we will get in the final?
The referee was desperate to send a black player off.
48 goals this season and he celebrates more when the dude was given red card
If we had more attack power like Lewa we would’ve had a chance
REFS WANNIT ALLVABOUT THEM THESE DAYS!!!!
Footballers are now Mannequins in the penalty area Handball rules are silly and ridiculous 😂
Both penalties were ludicrous, this rule has to change.
Milan teams and Real vs City! amazing games. The ref for the Milano games needs the feds at his side for life, lol.  1:39 the difference in Haaland's mind-set, to that of Felix for Chelsea (first leg in Madrid ground; either your going to let me score or get a red card.) Am so in love with City, and how perfect their team is; so complete. Real are so GREAT, from the goalkeeper to the striker. Inter are old school with proven killers and hard-nose defenders; Milan, they have youth, and flashy attackers/ a perfect match-up 😍😍😍
City best English side ever
Another 2 absolutely brain dead penalty decisions. Imagine if either of those had decided the game, or was in a final or a league decider. When are they going to fecking change the rules back to what it used to be, which incidentally worked 100 times better than this utter nonsense. HANDBALL IS A FOUL WHEN ITS A DELIBERATE ACT UNDER THE JUDGEMENT OF THE REFEREE. Jeeeeez what a farce!
As talented as he is, For me Leroy Sane has always been an under performer in big games. He should’ve finished that first attempt
Can't believe city didn't win 5 or 6 as normal.  They definitely need to spend more money.  Need 500 million on the bench to keep crushing everyone.
Same as the handball mane won in the cl final a few years ago, just aiming at the player's hand
Bayern were better shame they couldn't do more 1st game
Bayern without Lewy just isn't the same 😒
Ederson has been crazy in form the last few weeks
This is the year CMON CITEH
Its in real madrids dna, they will beat city, the frauds
Bayern not quite the force of old. Missing a striker as Sadio Mane hasn't worked out for them. Obviously they got crazy money for Lewandowski but it's not looking quite the great deal it appeared on paper.
I thought mané got suspended?
Ман.Сити чемпион
Man City will not win the champions league 😂they will never sing that.. champions of Europe they will never sing that! 😂😂
Haaland is a monster I ain't seen nothing like him 1st season at city and he's unstoppable
Both penalties were a joke 😮
yes atleast they didnt win on the night
Upamaguire was City's MVP over the two legs
This guys one of the worst referees in football. Why is he referring in ucl matches? He should be in Sunday league.
Imagine lewandowski scored 3 in 5 minutes. What a game that would be
Laporte did the Penaldo 😭😭
Umpalumpamechano was ok today
Upamecano playing Sunday League over the last 2 legs… 🤔🫠
How awful has Upamecano been in the two legs.
Upamencano is an absolute liability 😂
Haaland 🤫🤫🤫🤫
Worst commentary ever...
Bad day at the office for Upamencano...
Bayern without Lewandowski is like Paris without Eifel tover.
that ref was so delusional
Tuchel was missing his Chelsea
And they going to loose to Madrid 😂
Upemecano is on Karius level bottling. Over both legs he single handedly gave city the game
Haaland bagging 12 goals over about 5 and a half games leaves him likely to beat Ronaldo's 17
Only British commentators would say that wasn’t a penalty for Bayern. They like making up their own rules. It doesn’t matter if he was too close and couldn’t avoid it. It’s a hand ball unless the ball rebounds from ur body, then it would be ball to hand. People needs to understand that their made up rules will only cause conspiracies as ‘distance’ in this case can’t truly be measured
Upamecano had a tough night lol.. a red card, then a yellow, gave away a penalty and slipped to let Haaland score and got knocked out of the Champions League all in 90 mins..
Sommer was unreal in the first game but I think Ederson deserves more credit in both games. He gets so much hate but he’s one of the best keepers in the world.
No Lewy no final
This time Real won't be lucky City will smash them.
It's a black and white decision to me but when it's recorded or showing without paying then f this sport.
SMALLEST CLUB IN MUNICH
Worst penalty decision I have ever seen ( Not a city fan either )
That save at 2:05 was hella underrated.. as a keeper I know, and even if I wasn't I could imagine how scary it is to just launch yourself at a metal post like that.. takes guts to get across that quickly that close to the post..
As a City fan I’m loving it can’t wait to smash Madrid this is our year
That is a strong atmosphere
Everyone saying the pen shouldn't of been given it was a clear hand ball inside the box pity or not the ref simply doing his job haha any other situation the ref doesn't do their jobs people are on it straight away.
Oopsamecano
City are bookie's favourites, but who'd put serious money against Real?
Man City Real will be a goal-fest can't wait
Upamecano has been such a liability for Bayern all season long...he was decent in Leipzig, I don't think he workout out for Bayern...
Tuchel is just so dumb
How much did City pay Umpecano? he played like Harry maguire for both legs.
That ref needs shooting 😂
feel bad for Uppy, I'd rather have just been sent off.
Imagine having Upemecano and Mcguire in the same team in defense.... 😂
Can't slip like that there at this level, cost them all the goals...!!
Why is city dressed up like Dortmund?
Upemacano being the French Harry maguire 💀
The problem for Real Madrid the first leg is their home crowd. If they get battered like they did back in 19/20 it will be a diasater. Man City have a striker something Real Madrid currently don't have seeing that Benzema is missing alot of sitters.
We all need more teams like city and psg respecting financial fair play xD.
It's safe to assume that whoever wins in the Real V City clash will win the CL as the final will be a much much easier tie against either Milans....
I've never seen haaland miss a pen. Bro has to genuinely nerf himself to give everyone a chance omg
fraudulent penalty call. Should have ended 0 1 City.
City seemed like they didn't care about the result of this game lol
The level of bias from the commentators, fine with the bayern hand ball but say the city one is ridiculous when it was clearly much worse
The Akanji penalty is an absolute joke and we all know it.
How is that a pen at the end
Ngl they should have put muller mane and davies in the starting 11 for both matches, after they were put on Bayern were playing much better
"Cityzens" is just tragic. It sounds like something fans of a teenage vlogger would call themselves.
Can't believe he give Bayern a penalty..
This feels like City's year.
It's official german taxi league . .  bayern have now been down graded to match the rest
Real Madrid's run coming to an 🔚
Lewandowski was so pivotal for that Bayern
Both penalties were very soft, expecially the second one. Doesn't matter, City deserves to be in the semis.
Upamacano is really playing against Bayern 💀
Real ones know Bayern dominated this game and Upamencano was the difference over the two legs. He was so good while also being so bad. 3 goals he made himself. Great game tho
Dogshit VAR again
2:49 HE IS HUMAN!
i just feel sorry for kahn
Theres 1 imposter vs 3 teams with real UCL heritage, i hope 1 of the milan team can win the whole competition
Why hasn't Muller been starting? He's a big game player
On the march !
That same ref has been charged with match fixing in the past. He's a terrible, terrible referee
madrid vs inter final, madrid win
ederson my man of the match what a keeper
Cmon
I don't think City looked that great in the first half of both games and if Madrid are clinical and have some luck on their side, I could see an upset happening again. Pep needs to stop playing it's so safe, they're by far the best team in world football but if they keep trying to be perfect, they'll end up with no chances and letting lucky goals in.
This time no mistake Man City 3 : 1 madrid lucky last time NOT this time fam ⚽
Just remember whilst Erling Haaland is breaking all these records that I scouted him years ago during his Molde days and begged Celtic to sign him. I even emailed the club requesting it! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🍀
?lucky
Erling Salah
Man city in dortmund colours,  salt , wound, rub.
I personally think Real will walk through the City defence after watching this
2 ridiculous penalty decisions
At the end of it all, everybody will talk about how good Haaland and De Bruyne where. But Bernardo Silva was fantastic tonight. With the exception of Messi, he’s the best dribbler in modern football.
Sane is rubbish
England destroys Germany yet again 😂😂😂
Refs are getting a god complex
Upamenguire
Upamencano simply sensational for city over the two legs
Thought they was screaming IRONS at the start 😂😂
Sane's golden chances first and second leg would've no doubt helped Bayern go through to semis
Immense defence yet again!!!
Handball decisions were brutal. Well done City.
What did Tuchel learn from his meditation trip in India if he is screaming and getting sent off like this? Stay calm like Don Carlo mate.
The new handball rules RUINING football
Bayern defence horrible
Oliver Kahn will destroy Bayern Munchen with his bad ego and arrogance
Haaland celebrating a man being sent off. I have never liked that guy from day one. This is just another reason that strengthens the opinion.
Imagine a classic again 😲
Felt bad for coman
Upamechano has been disastrous for Bayern over both legs.
Mane wasn't trying to shoot at goal, he aimed with full force in the defenders direction from less than 1 metre away. Ridiculous decision.
"Cityzens ". No.
Upamecano’s luck finally ran out when halaand scored my guy was riding some sold your soul kinda luck until then
If Pep doesn't win it with a loaded squad, unlimited money and over one hundred breaches of misconduct to win.... Then it's a huge failure again.
Bring it on Hala Madrid
So we are going to ignore the fact City was found guilty for breaching FFP and allow them to win the UCL so in a few years time the trophy is taken of them
Was hoping Bayern would put up a game, but the top German team was no match for the 2nd tier English team
mane is very good why is not start
no one talking about Ederson anymore, highly underrated
Jack grealish proved tonight how overated he truly is, 100 mill 😂😂  the only hard working thing about him is the hamster that tries to operate  his brain
Bro why’s haaland shushing after that pen 💀
That Bayern penalty is the stupidest VAR decision yet, which is saying something.
That Sane miss at the start was so crucial . He had to score that .
The most embarrassing part was the referee awarding a penalty to Bayern because he felt sorry for them.
Come on the blues 💙
Bayern should be embarrassed by that goal....but they need to rebuild.....if man city neutralize vampire vinicius Jr then they play AC Milan in the final.
Regardless of whether he missed the penalty that's another very soft penalty for handball
That penalty was an absolute joke, even Bayern fans will admit that
A new strategy in the Champions League is instead of going for a goal, in the penalty box try and aim for the opponent's hands
I had baked beans for tea
Halland is 🥶
UPAMECHANO IS A MEME
The passage of play for cities goal was so entertaining!
Upermacano is the difference between the two sides
Time to win it all
Ederson with a masterclass performance
Ref was a joke
That's a clear penalty for handball. I don't know why the commentators are having such a hissyfit about it. BT Sport fell off hard...
Harland did same celebration as lukaku but no yellow card
City should destroy Madrid on paper..but on paper doesn't win football matches. Pep will probably believe he's god and pick a random weird side and blow it 😅
Upamecano is TERRIBLE 😂
As a Bayern fan that penalty at the end was pure insanity, can’t believe they gave us a pity penalty
Zzzzzzzzzz
Only goal “mighty” Munich scored against City is a penalty lol
Coman is such a brilliant player. So underrated.
How come Joao Cancelo was playing against City, when he is a City player loaned away earlier this year?!
The penalty to Bayern was disgusting😖his less than an inch from the player tf is he meant to have no arms
Invited all of bayerns pressure and only conceded to a penalty that wasn’t a penalty
Liverpool fan but I see this being city’s year. They’ll be out for revenge against madrid after how the tie between them ended last year, and respect to both inter and AC Milan but I think city will beat either of them. But we’ll have to wait and see , will be a thrilling finish to the tournament
Penalty all day... don't know why the commentators so upset... The cross was going into the box, the ball wasn't over the line. I'm English and even I hate the bias commentators have towards English clubs. Ridiculous
Erling halaland scoring in the last night of Ramadan mashallah habibi
Haaland scores, grass is green and the sky is blue, what else is new
Both handballs where a joke in my opinion
Fix
So with the decision to overturn the red card for the Upamecano incident, VAR rightly stepped in and called the right decision, which showed Haaland was offside.   So, nobody can deny the value of VAR and how it is better for the modern game.
Haaland only missed the penalty to convince people he’s human 🤔
Sick of my team in the Championship. Bigger than the other 23 clubs but i deserve better. So I follow City. They get my time. City to win.
Sick of my team in the Championship. Bigger than the other 23 clubs but i deserve better. So I follow City. They get my time. City to win.
Real are going to be tough for City. I feel Real are favourites for that game.  Pep need not be the tinker man.
Upumacano is dog how he starts for france over saliba baffles me
Ederson was clutch over both legs. Took this sting out of Bayern's attacks tonight 🔥
Upamecano should be playing non league football. Bayern are useless
👇 City is gonna win the Champions League
Even when he misses a penalty he still scores👀
Did they wear these shirts just to look like Borussia Dortmund?
No way either should have been a penalty.
1. Oliver Khan is not as smart as he thinks he is. 2. Leroy Sane missed important chances in both legs, he is not as good as he thinks he is.
Buzzing for Madrid Vs City tie - will feel like a final!!!
City were the better team and deserved to go through over 2 legs but please tell me which genius in Bayern’s board decided to sign Crapamencano. Man city are a good team, don’t give them goals. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a worse more uncomposed performance over 2 legs. And by a. Player that cost 50-60 million. Disgrace. Arsenal dodged a bullet with. That one.
1:40 - Haaland celebrates after red card which then gets overturned 😂 2:47 -  Haaland steps for pen up & blazes it over  4:18 Haaland scores & silences Bayern fans  Quite the night
The Madrid tie is going to be another classic. The main difference this time though, is that Madrid are away in the 2nd leg. Can't wait to see how it pans out.
City definitely have  no class compared to Liverpool or United or Arsenal !
Finally, Pep not listening to the voices in his head. This time he didn't decide to go with a weird formation like he did in the past in those crucial European fixtures. Like playing Bernardo Silva in DM
For us neutrals.. we have two unbelievable semi finals coming up! Can't wait
That was never a penalty😂😂 Man City made a mockery of Bayern, 4-1 over the 2 legs is shocking!!
Haaland shook upemacano out his boots
Upamecano with the worst individual CL performance I've ever seen, shocking
Both penalty decisions were soft, but jesus christ that Bayern pen was ridiculous!
This city side are scary, I think they will genuinely win the treble, Haaland in absolutely unbelievable form
Haaland phases throughout the game: Robot  Human after all Back to robot🤖🤖🤖
🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫come on city 🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵
Haaland-Next Ronaldo Vinicius-Next Neymar Mbappe-Maybe next Messi   They are the future of football Mark my words. Haaland will win the ballon dor The WC isn't everything
Haaland scores tonight ……. Now for more surprising news, It turns out grass is green
This Game had everything! Personal Highlights   EDERSON sending that Bayern player to subways for a footlong BMT and sensations crips.  HAALAND missing that pen but then scoring that beautiful goal - Next Ballon Dor 2023  CANCELO burning bridges by fouling Bernado and also celebrating the Haaland miss.   SANE and MANE Substitution- Was i the only one who wondered whether they would even make eye contact lol  REFEREE being escorted out of the stadium at the 120th min by a 12 man SWAT TEAM accompanied by UPAMECANO!
sad to see tuchel bench muller for both legs, dont know what hes thinking not starting davies too
Halaand in his prime
Lmfao - who the hell calls city the cityzens
Arsenal have no chance
damn bayern really miss lewandowski
If Real Madrid vs City is anything like last seasons semi final matches then we’re in for a treat two great semi final matchups
First comment 😮
First
He just scores goals
Upmecano really wanted man city to reach the semi-finals
Bosh
Yo
City made this tie look so easy, Unstoppable. It's going to take a lot of work to stop them from winning the treble this season!
first

First
If only Bayern signed a certain champions league top scorer.
Upamecano is the French Maguire

Yes cityy
1st 🎉
haaland vs benzema scary if benzema can stay fit
Upamecano was shambolic in both legs, disgraceful performance
Here's what I think..  Mbappe = Messi's ability with CR7's attitude  Haaland = CR7's ability with Messi's humility  I'll be # teamHaaland for the next decade
Ok
