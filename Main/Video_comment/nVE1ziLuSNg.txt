Why are tears running down my cheeks? Unbelieveably beautiful!
2025, I listen to this song everyday!
Of course he's real hes always at the mall and he even clones himself across multiple malls honestly tired of everyone saying he doesn't exist like grow up man
my friend just put me onto this, and holy shit I think I just ascended 😭
3500th
Everytime I feel the need to harm myself I listen to this song. Thank you Vessel and ST for making a song that makes people feel seen , heard and loved.
"Frothing at the maw"  Well that seals it.  Worship.
God everything has sounded like this for years now. Anything new around? It's getting ridiculous
Fire music🔥🔥🔥🔥my fav music btw
I love the statue ❤
❤
Holy Water eh?  Nice...  :)  Amen...
Love that Vessel is such a scientist!
Their songs are epic
The piano is great.
Thanks for keeping me good company the last few days, I had some difficult requirements to assimilate. Back to regularly scheduled programming this evening. 😅 One love, sovereign hearts. 👑
These men simply blow myfucking mind! Holy hell!!!
Eu sei que o Vessel é o João Pedro Pais, cabrão
I love that you can hear his accent when he sings
This song and “The Summoning” are my top two favorite Sleep Token songs. ❤❤
FALLING IN REVERSE É MELHOR.
the song from the best band in my opinion
This is so beautiful!!!
How much of a genius does it take to write masterpieces??? What's the price of genuis???
1:23 that little lone piano chord  sounds like a windows sound effect
I can't even begin to express how much I enjoy listening to your music! Thank you :)
I was listening to this song for the first time abd when the piano chords were playing it felt oddly familiar and like I'd heard it before. Then I realised it sounds like the piano in Velvet by Stormzy! If you listen to it, you'll understand what I mean. Not saying there's a problem with that, both songs are wicked! Just saying it felt very familiar.
FFS! These guys are great!
fcin gem
Superestimando o Rei, sendo que o Royale é mais forte que ele kkk
The fucking piano gets me man…
I love it sleep token ❤❤❤❤
Oof
the piano.
I would like to thank my daughter for interdisciplinary me to this incredible band!
I've loved sleep token for YEARS now ❤❤
Okay call me crazy but yall actually sit down and listen and i mean really listen to this song all the way through it sounds like there are voices that start between 2mins 18 seconds to 2 mins 37 seconds ish like either a busy diner or busy everyday life or a busy street like really listen it's pretty cool it's like a highlight for me of the song acatully ❤ very clever vessel ❤
Well, my love is an animal call Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls Between teeth on a broken jaw Following a blood trail, frothing at the maw These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford The perfect start to a perfect war Putting down the roses, picking up the sword  Aqua regia  Aqua regia  Well, my past is a holy book A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook Between the pain and the way you look I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook And these days I'm a picture frame Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain All of Eden's vices running through my veins  Aqua regia  Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of Oh, and I am done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing And I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging  Aqua regia  Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of
the only other time i heard that phrase was in the movie Return of the Living Dead.
This one is my favourite
THIS IS PURE 💩 😂
I wish ST didn't make me think of that one person who did me wrong ehhh, this song slaps but it just makes me sad :,DDD
Thank you for making such beautiful words come to life within a song.  🖤💜
Generic autotune radio crap music
Getting water temple vibes from this
listen to these songs its like listeting it for the very first time , there are so many details , thats why i love this band so much
This is beautiful
Jakarta, 00:34am. Friday, September 26th 2025.
I can’t this song loud enough
Makes me think of odst 😅
The Angels shall descend for the bolted on booty fertile breeding women. And the shall stay for art ish like this. Glorious
This is so 🔥
Anyone in 2025?!
someone cooked here
Hey if you're a fan of sleep token then you're a toker that's what I named  us the tokers just like maggots I'm a maggot 2 fuck yeah if anybody uses tokers make sure you drop my name Matthew G I named us if theres a better name for us even better 🤘✌️👊
This song is a fucking masterpiece, only the 5th Token song I've ever heard and, wow, just wow... Completely blown away, what an absolute gem, it shot right up into my top 3 favorite songs, displacing whoever the hell was there, I can't remember now, it's all a blur
I asked Chat GPT what this song was about and it said this: Unlike the horny swagger of The Summoning or the desperate clinging of Mine, this one is almost detached. It’s melancholy, resigned, like he’s watching the world burn and just quietly playing his piano about it.
From this to Vore...what a gut punch.
You thunder through my veins, Relentless and divine.
Ghost and AFI tour? If this new AFI album stays with this vibe then a tour would be perfect.
Damn, this is fucking epic
my favorite one on this album!   Grilled cheese on my broken jaw! 😁
The ascending whole tone scale but with breaks in it... Like levitating but with little pieces trickling off as if something is disintegrating but in a peaceful way. It's transcendental.
increible, temazo, tremenda banda
Work of art
very nice song
love this song soooo much!
This sucks so bad I could cry…😢
It doesn’t really hit for me. It’s somewhere between imagine dragons and new kids on the block but as elevator music 😢
What is this masterpiece?
Wow what an amazing song ❤God bless u ALL ❤
So...what's this song about ? 🤔
We can all agree no other artists have brought so many genres together before to create tracks like this 🥹
This song is so perfect that I cried hearing it for the first time, the rolling base in the back, the perfectly smooth lyrics, this song rolls down your ears and tickles your brain.
Listening to this feels like the musical equivalent of reading notes and lore in a souls game.
Holy moly! New fan! I’m in love!!!❤❤❤❤
This reminds me of Kingdom Hearts
🖤 Sleep Token & Loathe 4 ever 🖤
Bro do you relate to this song or something cuz the way you captured the emotion of this song is like it was your own story to tell. One of my favorite covers I ever heard on YouTube and I’ve been on this platform for years. Truly gifted. 🤘🏾
This is gonna sound strange but this song sounds like a James Bond opening
Anyone hear HALO 3 ODST ❤
Love you guys!!!
New fan of this band and im just obsessed. This song is so good i listen to it every day, can get enough.Vessel can sing any kind of music and its all magical. Love the voice!!!Thank you for sharing your talent with us :)
I am acidic let's acid Floyd kiddo
I could listen to "Vessel" play piano all damn day long! 🎹 🎹 🎹
So beautiful!
I waited whole time just for some heavy guitar works in a Subtle way....lol.....😢
I will never forguet this incredible band. My favorite, forever...
This album is so soothing and astonishing.
This piano😭 what am I listening to??? Sleep Token's got such a diverse soud. It felt like I'm listening to a piece from a different era
I have know about sleep token for a while and heard a song called caremel through tik tok and finally decided to dive in and this music is amazing
🎉🎉😊
I’m in band and I love music but the synth and bass in this song makes me appreciate how much people take music for granted this song is always magical
It sounds like stuff from Imagine Dragon. I definitely don't like it 🤷‍♂️
My eyes dripped when I heard this melody
Oh Soul 💜💜🖤🖤
I haven’t met a person of any race that didn’t like something about this song. Everyone I’ve made listen all agree Vessels cold on them keys, EVERYONE likes that part, you already know what part. 😂
oh no it’s all over my screen
BEST SONG EVER!  I LOVE EVERYTHING THEY DO BIT THIS SONG JUST HAS MY SOUL! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
So f’cking gorgeous
oh hell no I'm buying this album where the fuck was I
Subatomic interactions if it's all good  Putting down the roses picking up the sword.
S/O to the Tarkov streamer Landmark for getting me into Sleep Token. First song i ever heard by them and now im about to dish out 300 for a ticket to see them live
This is pure ambrosia.
Usually when i like a song i listen to it until i hate it,but I've been listening to this one for a while and it still gives me chills like I'm hearing it for the firts time again 🥺
Quien puede cometer el gran error de llamar Metal a esto?
Me likey for reals
Vessel makes lyrics work in a way I never thought of, i genuinely would love all their songs in a book format, like a poetry book
My favourite ❤
Vessel from God
wow
Wow this is a masterpiece!
In the morning I wake and bake, at night I’m sleep toking.😌😶‍🌫️
a maior e melhor obra de arte que tive acesso por hoje...

i just discovered what aqua regia means after watching a guy dissolve gold to create purple gold made of gold aluminum alloy
need this in my blood rn
Self love
Everybody gangsta until 2:17 when the piano solo hits.
This is my go to go to make me feel good when im in any crappy mood! Top 3!
Mozart of the 21st century
I have the "putting down the roses picking up the sword" tattooed on my chest 😅
WHO PUTS A II-V-I TURNAROUND IN A METAL CHORUS WHAT IS HAPPENING
How are they so good🙀🙀😍
Metel Hiphop R&B Jazz ❤
Nobody understands 🔥
This is the tune I use to get pianists into your stuff, and explain the writing. ;)
Thanks Emily
I love Sleep Token
This is Michael the Archangel... Currently your my fav band... Just dont tell pearl jam, 311, Bush, Ghost or Matisyahu ❤❤❤
Video starts Entity of aqua regia melting/flowing: exists  Odo of DS9, that you? Ain't looking too hot, mate
1:16
This is my favorite from the album
UNİQUE
I am so addicted to this song right now.
Hell no this band sucks. Weird contemporary Christian vibes dressed and Satan worshipers.. gtfoh
sziassztok nagyon tecik a kirayviz
Listened once…totally obsessed 🖤
MNI WICONI
Makes me think of dancing ❤❤
I’m no drum girlie by holy crap the drums!
This is my first time listening to sleep token my sister just linked me this song Holly fucking hell is it good and that's not just me being baked out of my mind right now after work 😂😂😂❤😂
ES UN TEMAZOOOOOOOOOOOOO DIOS MIO ❤‍🔥
Laying here and the voice just melted all over
Man, smooth as hell. My friends have been recommending some seriously awesome stuff to me lately. I get strong Daniel Johns vibes from this ("Mansions" in particular).
"No wonder my arms are still ringing" 🥹
This is my favorite song ❤
This is the voice of Fred durst
The amount of hate this song gets is wild
Sleep token makes me feel like I’ve just had a break up, while just getting married. Like I’m doing something wrong but it’s natural and right. Like I’ve suffered grief of loss, while holding my first born for the first time. Like doing a drug for the first time, while exhausted from years of the same drug.
That keyboard rift is sexy AF.
TOOL ruined music for me a long time ago and now sleep token has rekindled that flame and is now burning it to the ground all over again for me. Still sleep token it's not nearly as good as TOOL. No band will ever be as good as TOOL. TOOL is the greatest band of all time. They've literally wrote down the Bible and the human experience in music format. No one will ever take the crown from Maynard James Keenan on being the word smith lyrical genius who writes words that strikes down to your bone, cuts through your soul and hits you at the very core of your being. But I do believe that sleep token if given time has what it takes to take the gauntlet from TOOL and push the envelope even further.
🔥🍃🌹🗡️ Love it 🖤
I’ve just started listening to sleep token and now I can’t listen to anything else
Sleep token is so good I can’t listen to anybody else 😢😂
Without the singing this would be alright music
Sleep token makes my brain tickle in the best way and now I’m ruined for any other music.
Putting down the roses, picking up the sword, huh? Gotcha....
Every time is first time for me. Sleep token is unbeatable.
Came here to see the hype,  well worth it!
Found sleep token last december while at the lowest I'd been in a while, listening to them on the mend is a whole different experience of equal intensity. Vessel's versatility is insane
This is what pop needs, not the same generic trash we have now.
How come this only has 8 million views?
2:46 - 3:16 I've never used all of my oxygen to scream any part of a song louder before 🥲🖤
These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford 🔥🔥 0:46
A guy on bumble had the chorus of this song as his bio. Swiped left but my ears are burning in joy with the music he helped me discover
Man these guys are so cringe its hard ro believe
I listened to this song every day on repeat for like 3 weeks. I just love it
the base line makes me feel things...
vessel has a good voice
I found this band on Spotify back in November. And ive probably listened to them over and over since then. Im a listener of 90s and early 2000s. This band blew me away in my emotions and what was feeling from their music. Ascensionism 🎶 definitely got me in my feelings.
My son loves this song. He's one and a half years old. ❤
how comfort it is to hear something like this and had a sleep for at least 9 hours
fantastick!
3:17
Only 8.2 million views!? This should have hundreds of millions of views.
Anyone who doesn't listen to Token is sick
this song hits a special spot
Man the beginning of this song feels like that tiktok that shows all 80s and 90s things we miss and had 😂😂 but this is such a jam too
Ohh when I am done dancing to alarm bells! This one hits hard
I am a new listener and omg I hate myself for not finding them sooner!!! Literally they are overtaking my playlist and flooding my brain!!!
개좋다.
Fav🤌🏻 no words for how perfectly this song hits.
Aqua....fina 💧💦
Sleep Token fans: Thanks for saving my life Vessel: I'm literally just Hozier with a disguise and metal guitars
❤
One element that is impervious to corrosion by aqua regia, sea water and chlorine…element 22
🤟🫶
Somebody's reading about cows.....
Am I the only one who's ears want to here "You are....cinema" when I hear "Aqua.....Regia"
блестяще!
When someone asks what Genre Sleep Token is I need an All button? Is that a genre? It is now! How else do you classify them? Next level brilliance. Someone has to be drafting a college class just on Sleep Token Music Theory.
I absolutely love this band but i couldnt help but hear borat saying "he can not afford"
I am new here i just thought listening to this specific song that it sounded like Hozier Take me to Church "my lover has got hunour" line. They could collab 😂
This is not metal
Putting down the roses and picking up the sword never felt so correct.
DESCOBRI ESSA MÚSICA A DOIS DIAS E ACHO QUE JÁ ESCUTEI MAIS DE 100 VEZES. sleep token vocês me tem
This is my favorite song from them, it just hits different 💜😭
They don't miss.
Sleep Tokens deep intense melodic sound mixed with vessels vocals just makes you close your eyes and be in a tranquil place of perfect serenity...
Eden’s vices running through my veins ughhh this man is sick with his lyric choices and I absolutely love it
I need this with the only vocals like you're underwater and you can hear anything by yourself
Massive Jacob Collier vibes mixed with Mutemath with those drum ghost notes. Musical brilliance
This song makes me wanna fall in love
This might piss off Sleep Token fans, but I have to say it—in certain songs, they remind me of a proggy version of Imagine Dragons, but with a more mellow, chilled vocal style. I know this might invite some hate, but I stand by it because I trust my ears when it comes to these things! Just to be clear, I think they’re incredible musicians, and this comparison isn’t meant as an insult at all—it’s just an honest observation.
worship
Someone tell me at 2:22 if they can hear the background sounds. It sounds like a dining room, or a cafe. Am i going crazy??
Okay this And Granite ties for Favorite❤❤❤❤😊
lots of people taking the hardware for granted, not too mention supreme software
So alkaline tells us that shes not acid nor alkaline, which would mean shes 7 on the ph scale, which is neutral, pure water. Alkaline is the 7th track.  Now here we see that water "aqua" is Royal "regia"
When my wife was jamming this i talked alot of sh** but now im here low key jamming sleep token singing to myself. My shirt is almost here 😂
aqua regia
It's got a very tool sort of sound in the music. I love it. Only discovered their stuff tonight.
Oooh, this one plucked the right string at just the right moment. Damn. Feels good man.
I took a break from Sleep Token..... WHY???? I LOVE this band so much and I have been depriving myself for what reason? Definitely kicking myself in the ass, but I am back!
It'is divine
Sleep token has been ruined for me by my absolute cunt of a friend who i was supposed to be seeing ST live with until he decided he cba to drive there and i missed out and lost the money for the tickets, jacob i hope you read this and realise how much of a cunt you are
😢
sorry, does nothing for me. pretty boring actually
Lyrics  for me to sing along 😏 Well, my love is an animal call Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls Between teeth on a broken jaw Following a blood trail, frothing at the maw These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford The perfect start to a perfect war Putting down the roses, picking up the sword Aqua regia Aqua regia Well, my past is a holy book A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook Between the pain and the way you look I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook And these days I'm a picture frame Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain All of Eden's vices running through my veins Aqua regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of Oh, and I am done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing And I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging Aqua regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of
Just really freaking upset I didn't find this band sooner. Like wtf I love this music more people deserve to know about it!
Ik  but did anyone ever hear about Josie and the pussycats
Saw Sleep Token In Paris La Défense Arena... First part for Linkin Park... The sound was so fucking horrible... A real shame !!!!😢
https://youtube.com/shorts/-0tq87-Wqog?si=IB-KCoPQZwaZG82s
this would be good if the singer knew more than two notes
these guys are rapidly growing on me
2:40 hits like goth Mr. Rogers Neighborhood
How many metal bands have written viable songs for burlesque dances?  Dunno but this would work well for that application
https://youtube.com/shorts/ax6dlQnUGH4?si=45ZQyzUYrlh6l71p
when polyphia finnaly get vokalist
HEY!
His voice just makes your soul melt
Fuclk that break down at 3.19.
The only thing I don't like about this band even though they are so talented is that every song is like an intro that never actually gets going when you're waiting for the song to start
This is baby making music
Something about this song that I can't get enough of.
I remembered listening to this song back then on Myx top 10 everyday before I go to school. My mornings back then were the best.   Waking up everyday. My usual breakfast was luncheon meat, scrambled eggs, fried rice and black coffee. Then after the top 10, that's when I leave to school.   Aaahhh. Those were the days
Rock and roll is alive and well.   \m/
I swear sleep token is healing my broken heart
Just found this band….song is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The verse in this song is just amazing
Came here through REM from sh*ts & gigs recommendation.
Incredibly unique
i just found this band and Loved it. <3
Found gold in my search for metal.
The piano solo is so good
I can't even lie. Sleep Token 100% helped me out on this spiritual awakening. Thank you.
BRASIL 🟨🟩🟦⬜
The beginning of the beat sounds like Mario and Donkey Kong water levels. Too dope
This song chord structure is yacht rock...but clearly not performed that way!! Ingenious!
listening is not enough, I need this music playing inside my soul
I absolutely LOVE this song! It's truly incredible!❤‍🔥
I hear this and know that I don't have enough slow jams in my life these days.
I got on this band with most others about a year ago right after that certified banger was released and I’m still here with this music blasting through my veins!!
Better version of ‘Cinema’ by Benny Benassi
The vibiest song.
2:45 is my favorite part, it's so pretty sounding bro...
This song, alkaline, & the summoning some of their BEST work
Big up from India 🇮🇳
Worship
hawk tuah regia
Is that a good thing
My sister introduced me to sleep token, and now it's taking over my life
I was in a Greek Island in 2023 when I first discovered Sleep token and listened to this album. It was magical, had to grab a beer and enjoy!
Lyrics!! Vocals!! Piano!! Drums!!! Fucking guitar!!! Melody!!! Passion!!! Sweet sweet venom.
There’s nothing like sleep token!!!!! This is its own genre
Hi 1:14 .
I don't appreciate other bands at all anymore...
Delicinha
aqua regia is an acid mixture that can melt metals like gold and platinum . this is lyrically a fucking masterpiece. never heard of sleeptoken till last year and maaaaaannn......killer
Damn I need this 🥵🥵
Royal Water dissolving his gold.
This song is so slutty and I'm here for it.
This is worse than Nickleback.
Dissolving.....🫠
Yeah, man. This track. Everything about the vibe, melody and groove, mixed with the absolutidge perfecto lyrics. Yes. 🙌
I love this version; prefer it to release if I'm being honest! ❤
this is one of the greatest compositions ever created
Sleep Token is proof that anything can be metal.
Nice to see Vessel as a fan of Skrillex :) @sleeptoken
Lead singer is leo faulkner ex lead singer from backlit canopy
Epixo
Alguem faz um karaoke dessa musica pfvr q eu auero meter o locão no bar em gutural
I love the metaphorical sexual subtext of the lyrics..”subatomic interactions if it’s all good”.
Same style than Imagine Dragons, the singer has the same voice than Dan Reynolds 😧
I cannot believe this song gave me a tear there's just no way a song can be so beautiful as this.
hic sunt leones
Subatomic interactions if it’s all good 🥵🤔🙃🤭😏❤
Idk what you call this genre but I need more of it in my life, now.
minute 2:18 sleep token transforms the song into jazz it is perfect
I haven't had a song where I wanna listen to it over and over and over again for a long time.  So fuckin good
I cry to every song of this album lol fuck
It’s like if Zedd and Imagine Dragons and 5FDP did a “Making the Band”.
✨️🎵integrated hardware you cannot afford🎵✨️
My 16 yr old daughter claims she doesn’t like the Token, but I heard her jokingly mumbling Aqua Regia. She’ll eventually come around 🔜, y’all.
I am 52 years old, and Sleep Token is my favorite band. Worship.
Worship 🫶🏼😩
_"...And these days, I'm a picture frame_ _Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain..._ _Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain_ _All of Eden's vices running through my veins~"_ activates me the way a finger placed gently upon my lips would. It's so passionately sung that you can feel the lyrics as you're listening... (*´꒳`*)
Elon musk himself doesn’t have enough money to get into heaven….. only the blood of Jesus Christ guarantees admittance into heaven!
This song is such a vibe
That song is so cathartic for me
❤
Liquid Gold
Way f%cking late to this find. Gotta admit that I've had this on loop for at least three days straight. Gorgeous composition
The opening of this song...looking up in the night sky at a full moon. Hauntingly beautiful. Sleep token is my new sound. Much love and respect
Why do their songs make me cry
Sleep Token is the most unique band we've ever seen, notice I didn't say best, I said unique
Listening to ST for the first time changed my life. I'm not exaggerating. I expected the best music and lyrics from every artist after I heard them and was disappointed. There's only one Sleep Token and they'll never be replaced.
Y’all blinding me with all the science 🔥💜 I love it so much 😭♾️
The Piano Solo was Exquisite and mindblowing😮 🔥🎵🎶
Cold love, hot blood. RUNNING to your heart when you're thinking of.....  Effffff 😵‍💫😵‍💫
That but from 2:47-3:17 is so beautiful
We need a new album full of songs because your the best
gorgeous.
Damn impressed ngl. Respected.
No wonder my ears are still ringing.........✨🔥🤟 Aqua Regia
It's impossible not to recognize the genuine intelligence of Vessel. Not just the poet but the teases at science, latin, faith, its always something amazing we find he is intelligent enough on to reference and speak on in such a magical way. I bet he is an incredibly interesting person to talk to.
One of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.
yall wanna chill with all these good songs bro
I want to marry this song
between the cringe fans, and their look not matching their sound, i assumed this band was like ghost. this song is what made me go back and listen. i still think the look doesnt match the sound, and the fans are still competing with icp levels of cringe, but i actually listen to sleep token daily now.
🔥👂🏾🔥👂🏾🔥👂🏾🔥👂🏾🔥👂🏾🔥👂🏾 flawless
These days I'm a circuit board, integrated hardware you cannot afford.  I felt that. I've got implants like no other.  These lyrics are absolute soul fire! 🔥
ADOREI CONHECER ÉSA BANDA 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Worship 🔥
Bet you didnt know you needed to hear a lounge jazz breakdown with chimes did you? Me either
Just when I'm giving up on music, these guys come along...🙏
I put them on to put me to sleep. They do good at that.
the start reminds me of castle in the sky my fav movie <3
my biggest flex is im listening to this for the first time
When you sing without a mic a lot you get a loud sound like we do hence why we are so good at screaming
The next album will be so much better just wait I can feel it
This band is bad ass
We gathered for worship.
Aqua Regia is my soul 👽🖤🤘🏼

I love this song, but my heart feels like it bleeds because this was the song that played after my dog died. I was rushing to an emergency vet I knew I wouldn't make it to in time. 💔
Discovered today. Obsessed. Wth
I can't explain my addiction to this one... someone make it make sense.
These videos remind me of a past mushroom trip
He kind of sings in cursive sometimes, and it's annoying as hell.
The songwriter is running to their person of interest’s heart whenever they think of them. The songwriter has been following a blood trail and can hear their person of interest calling for them, even through the darkness. They want to melt the rose gold chains and locks off their person of interest’s heart because too many swallowed keys lead to internal bleeding so time to talk about chemistry. Both parties know something divine is at work for their past, present, and future is penned in a book and they recognize each other on a subatomic level. None of it should be possible but, alas, it is.  Keeping an eye on the road, moving forward with conviction and praying for certainty, they try to find each other in the flesh and bone.  As they seek each other out and the songwriter pursues different methods to unlock their person of interest’s love, it starts a war among the heavens where stars collide and mountains shake.  *Just a creative response/interpretation of their music.
Ho-lee, SHIT. This songs smooth as a glass of *BOURBON*
Breath of the Wild undertones
This band has just taken me over, help is not needed
Well, my love is an animal call Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls Between teeth on a broken jaw Following a bloodtrail, frothing at the maw These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford The perfect start to a perfect war Putting down the roses picking up the sword Aqua Regia Aqua Regia Well, my past is a holy book A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook Between the pain and the way you look I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook And these days I'm a picture frame Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain Out of Eden's vices running through my veins Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of Oh and I am done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing And I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of
My newborn sleeps to this song. It's a blessing. So glad I found sleep token long ago when searching for ballad style metal. It's gorgeous
My comment may have nothing to do with the lyrical content of the song but this is the first song that played in my car on the way home after my grandfather passed away and it will forever remain in my heart. Sleep token is a band I will listen to for a long time to come. much love to you all.
Omg, this is so good!!!!
omg.. this is so divine.. I can’t.. take me to your cult.. worship
When I listen to these songs, I feel like I can almost touch what it feels like to be in love. That's the power of music, man.
I love this shit.  LOVE IT
Just heard Sleep Token for the first time yesterday and became ADDICTED to this song. I can't believe I'm getting the opportunity to find out even more about them.
These guys are tearing my head UP.
Aqua regia - latin for Regal water Sugar on the blood cells Carbon on the brain oxytocin  I swear these guys are just medicine dropouts xdd (or maybe the finished medicine and just started making music? 👀)
So are we just making pop songs now? Is this a metal band or not?
My boi is an amazing vocalist and a more amazing pianist
This generations Prince. His level of talent is rare. Instantly, my favorite musician of the 21st century.
WHOS HERE 2024!!
this song gives an emotion i can't describe but somehow I know it well.
Peanut butter
This song is to good me like bro this song is fire❤
This is so sensual. I can’t get enough.  It’s not music you just listen to . It engulfs you, mind body and soul.
That guitar riff at the end with the R&B vibe though??💀💀
This song <3
Tbh found this band through will Ramos cover of chokehold then heard Sleeptokens original and been listening ever since
Sleep token's composer is a stem student, I swear.
Have their albums on Spotify but i came to youtube to read the comments that pretty much sum up everything im thinking when i listen to these guys
This is a really masterpiece. Listen carefully to the piano and bass stop at the snare drum bit min 1:56 1:57 2:11 2:13 this is called delight for the ears
I just love the piano in the songs
Not enough songs sound....."ethereal", for lack of a better way to describe it. This band has it down to a T.
My goodness this song is such a vibe.
2:18 Suddenly we got new elevator music here 😂
Y do you sound like this
Why does it make me feel like this?
Gosh this song just tickles me in all the right places
had to look it up. Aqua regia is primarily used to produce chloroauric acid, the electrolyte in the Wohlwill process for refining the highest purity (99.999%) gold.
New here, this fucks. I'm hooked.
The boys are maddeningly talented. Deserve all the attention they get, just phenomenal
Sleep Token is Amazing
Have any sleep token fans ever listened to acid bath? Do yourself a favor and do so….soooo good. 🤘
Crap, holy f@ck! Fire!
perfeito
Vessel seems to know a bit about chemistry
This is sooo classy and chique. Man, these guys are phenomenal.
❤              .                           🎉
Beautiful... Sounds like a breeze...
its 36453735 th time i've been listen this song this week  , Help
Miss je :( was leuk Bente 😊 ❤
So no ones gonna talk about the song sounds just like from Colletta-song name "lemonade soda" 😮
sleep token = sex music
The new drug is coming out) Every video is the same)))
Was told to listen to this band.  Wanted to like it.  This is pop s(h)it for the ladies.  If you're a hard-leg metalhead; This is a quick heads-up; pass.
Oh my, is this the best song ever, or what?! It’s a song about dissolving gold and it feels like a slow river of liquid gold enriching the soul.
That was the fastest 4 minutes I’ve ever experienced! So smooth! Love the chord progression on the piano! Thank you Vessel for this gem!
His vocal technique at the end of the words board, afford, and sword!! 😮 How?? Just how?
“Grow back your sharpest teeth you know my desire” One of many lines throughout this song.  🔥Hot damn.
Caminhando sozinho entre milhões de pessoas. Vivendo a morte entre os mortos vivos. Chorando qs lagrimas de uma solidao compartilhada. Você viveu onde jamais poderia sorrir e morreu em meio aos sorrisos dos lugares onde nasceu. Desejar o fim quando apenas esta no começo e começar do fim quando queria tanto continuar. Nao sei se estou aqui ou onde vou parar,mas sei que existir é mais do que respirar é mais .
I've listened a million times at this is the first time hearing the Dark Signs music during the reference ❤
See you in Glasgow November cant fucking wait!!!!! 🤘
You can burn this one out your mind cause it was never about me was it.
This Squad is so badass
Still the best song to get you moving all the place
🔥 🔥 🔥
Esta es recien la cuarta cancion de Sleep Token que escucho y estoy soltando espuma por la boca por lo bueno que es esto
This song is pure perfection !
Brittany Broski brought me here
Oh yes, im dancing to alarm bells
❤✨
baby making music
someone with this diversity in their music definitely grew up listening and loving classical music no doubt in my mind the passion in the instruments as well as the lyrics beautiful seriously *bows down*
can someone please remix cinema by skrillex/benny benassi with aqua regia dont hate just listen!!!!!!
Best song on the album.
briliant
Classic R&B sounding.  :)
Es gracioso, porque en Monterrey no hay agua
"putting down the roses , picking up the sword" the feels.
They use soul chords and jazzy melodic progressions...I love that
The chorus fits super well with witchblades by lil peep
this is so damn amazing.. i can't stop listening to it
Awesome songs.  Love the incorporation of the jazz elements. Am I hearing lounge chatter effects in the background during piano solo!!!! beautiful chords!
Well hello Mergo's Wet Nurse.
Why the mask stuff and secrets?  Ghost
Sleep token low key got soul blood in them I’m not even joking they’re great I’m definitely a fan ❤
I think this is my favorite of theirs at least so far
I just found these guys and amazed..
This is my absolute faaavvvoorrriittteeee 😩🥰🥰🤞🏼
1/19/24 hearing sleep token for the first time and every song just seems to get better and better. Awesome and original.
Just loving the sheer diversity of this amazing band, and Vessel's vocals are like melting chocolate! So dark and sultry....mmmmm xxx
What are these entities?
banger
holy shit
I love how Creative and variable the songs from sleep token are 😃
I have to say I'm the biggest TOOLfan and you guys have gripped me so hard I sing your songs in my head all day please come to Minnesota
I just love how much diversity this band has, when I wanna just go hard I can but when I wanna chill I can do that too. One of the best bands I’ve come across in years
Yet another fav
That Piano solo has the same feelings as Bill Evans.
My dog loves this music video. Thank you Sleep Token!
The lyrical connection to chemistry is mindblowing! Sleep Token is absolutely one of the best bands out there right now.
gosh, i love sleep token so much it hurts 🖤
Play this for the 'Steely Dan Fan' in your life. If they dont get it, they're a poser.
A voz do Vessel é surreal demais ✨❤
A sensação de ouvir às músicas da banda Sleep Token é incrível, cada uma das músicas trazem um sentimento incrível ❤
2:46- 3:16. Them Neo soul chords . That voice at this specific part. Idk it gives me chills down my spine.
2:17 those piano solo man. I swear it tickles my memory but i dont know what it remind me of
aqutic ambience - Donkey Kong Soundtrack
Idk why but this song imo is so fucking beautiful the way it just flows with the instrumentals fucking amazing band
I assume that all these generated creatures are the deities in the Sleep Token mythos, but they all have 40k vibes to me
one of the best bands currently! love it!
Just here to show appreciation (worship) for this song. I'm usually into the metal/alternative vibe, but this got me right from the first soft piano chord played. It reminds me of warm summerdays of my past now lost in time, when my father would be deep into Jazz and we'd sit for hours and hours just listening - him in his favorite chair and me with my ear to the speaker. Not going to pretend to know a lot about music theory, but when I hear some of the chord progressions and notes played in this song - I'm right back there.  Still with my ear to the speaker. Other than the sappy walk down memory lane, I also just think this song is beautiful - it's...a sensation.
uffffffffffffffffffffffffff
When I painting ,listen aqua regia  expand creativity ..
Had this song playing while snowboarding yesterday, and it was incredible. I didn't think I could love this song anymore than I already do, but here we are
someone please tell me im not the only one hearing the Windows sound in the background (I love this song im just caught by the fact it works so well. )
Vessell has flow💯
Drumeos offering with II introduced to this band that I didn’t know I needed in my life. Holy shit are they amazing. I’m a hip hop head, hip hop/rap is so mediocre nowadays, this is so refreshing to enjoy!
Listened to a Few Big Singles Now Embarking on the Journey of all their Music. Hype to say the least
raaaddiiooooaaaccttiivveee
His voice at 2:46 😭😭😭
Why is this so romantic…
Empty music for empty generation
Here listening for the first time. And i’m in love with this band😍
I love how much the backing singers move about now. Got a whole mythology Siren vibe going on
So unique. My first time hearing this after listening to other stuff with metal in it. Crazy fun.
❤❤❤❤❤
Project band. Look up the members. That will tell you everything. Good idea to stay masked.
Forgive me if I'm stating the obvious, but I'm pretty sure this is about someone who's frustrated by how impersonal social media and instant messaging is.
Skeler
If I had $100 for every bad song sleep token have released I'd be homeless 😂
🕊️🕊️🕊️
Mannnn every song I listen to is like a whole different vibe and reason to love the band… this is throwing me for a loop!
This song tickles every corner of my brain. 😌
I need Amy Lee to hop on this for the piano that would be 🔥🔥🤘🏾😍
Really makes a difference in lyrics when you figure out what Aqua Regia is. Added to my daily playlist..
Perfect song, 10/10 🔥 @Crossing Acheron
bad
somebody kill me this is so fucking terrible
I haven't been this musically stimulated over a band in a long time ❤ god bless you ST
What the f is this pos?
This that song the nerdy dude you were cool with in HS be playing on first dates dropping panties faster than you copied his notes for science class
This is by far the best elevator music ever made
I want to tell my friends about this band but what genre would I say this is?
Love the subtle lyrical tie ins to other songs like take me back to Eden and chokehold
That like...piano part. It reminds me of the time where you're sitting in like, and offshoot of the main office of ur elementary school and the chair is big enough to be comfy with those gray cushions, that tube TV is on the shelf mount thing in the corner and it's got some slideshow with the current-ish goings on of the school, it's playing that soft piano/chimey/light drummy music, the world is large and safe and full of "magic" bc you are small and then your name gets called and you go in and it's just one of those moments you forget you know until something like this comes along in your life later.
I actually got dissolved in that.
Not exactly
This absolutely is a certified banger
These lyrics are above this life
this is shite
This song makes me feel like im walking on the red carpet as jm about to get out of the limousine, like the feeling of "holy shit i made it now witness me spread my wings" like damn thats the feeling im getting
The intro riffs bring donkey Kong country vibes
Sleep token nunca erra
WOw guys so good! Remember what I say, tomorrow you will be famous! Next Big Thing For sure, trust me!
this shit sounds like elevator music
These 4 beautiful humans decided to get together and flip the whole genre on its head,  (don’t ask me what genre because they’re one in their own) ladies and gentlemen…sleep token 🤟🏻
When the drummer needs a break from being a madman
The figure is melting gold at the start.  Aqua Regia is an acid that dissolves gold.  Chokehold has the line "I'll turn the walls to gold to bring you home again...".  Jeez I love the lyrical depth.
I came for the metal. Chokehold was my introduction.  I’ve heard every cut from TMBTE, yet somehow this is now my favorite.
thank you :)
I have a ritual I do every morning. First I listen to: “1”. Then “2”. Then Sundowning. Then Take Me Back To Eden… then I turn in some JOHNNY BOOTH, the only band that can rival sleep token!
encontré diamante en bruto
I am going apeshit every time II is on the drums.
alguien que hable español y quiera compartir conmigo la misma emoción que me genera sleep token  ❤
I can't believe how amazing this album is. I'm hooked.
i feel exceptionally connected
I discovered them this year from tiktok, and now I can say I finally have a favorite band. I'm a big metal emo type millennial. This shit hits differently in the soul. WORSHIP VESSEL. Sleep Token brings out my feral submissive side. I'm obsessed 😍 😈
I want an entire album like this.  Just all jazz fusion with R&B peppered in and Vessel with his sexy silky vocals.
I need a metal version of this song 😍
🖤
So for people wondering, Aqua Regia is latin for the word Royal Water, it is an incredibly strong acid, able to react with gold, therefore the "gold rush" part, the acid flux is connected most likely because well... Aqua Regia is an acid Subatomic interactions should be referencing the chemical reactions between gold and royal water oxytocin is a love hormone "Saturate me I can't get enough" is also refering to Aqua Regia, it's a strong acid so it can absorb high amounts of water, meaning that it can be saturated but it'll take a lot of liquid to dilute and meaning it "can't get enough" silicon ballrooms... probably a rubber room, hopefully without rats
Every freaking Sleep Token song is different and no matter how soft or heavy, I LOVE it!
cracking out on them for the first time...unreal...pro tip play this at 1.2x speed
Why does this hit so hard?     AMAZING JOB BTW
OMG his voice ❤
the intro always gives me mr. robot vibes, it´s like best of both worlds
I’m just excited to find another metal band I like other than in this Moment and motionless in white oh and New Year’s Day…some. And Manson and Ozzy is a no brainer
Day 2 on Sleep Token and well, they're the kind of artist that makes me feel glad to be alive to witness their work, not just the songs, the videos, the concepts but the comunity itself too
Why does @2:17-@2:45 give me Duelist of the Roses vibes, am I trippin??
rnb rock
<3
Sleep Token is a fine wine.
The chord progressions is just sooo goooddddd. The dissonance and resolve is amazing 🔥
This song is a true magic. No matter how many times i listen to it, it never looses that spark... the lyrics, the instruments, Vessels voice, everything! Sleep Token just simply can't create something bad!
Easily one of the best tracks off of Take Me Back To Eden.
Some of the best song lyrics I've ever heard in my life.
AQUA...FINA...
Não é possível!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Que musica perfeita cara.
VERY jealous of those who get to have their first listen of this album. Its fantastic in all the right places with the directions it takes.
I can’t get enough… Something about this song still being heavy yet still being an easy listen due to the piano and soft drums… It’s beautiful, it’s perfection
Masterpiece after masterpiece much love keep it up much love ❤️ rock on 🤘
If someone can remind me of the song this reminds me of thatd be great
No one: Absolutely no one: My last brain cell at 3 am: Aqua. Regia. Oxytocin running in the ether. Buns out. Weiner. But I gotta keep an eye out for Selener🤪
This is the most beautiful song ever made. With some jazz sprinkled at the end. Chefs kiss
IMAGINE MORGAN FREEMAN READING THESE LYRICS LIKE A POEM
this song in particular  f u c k s
I appreciate this song more after knowing that Aqua Regia is used to dissolve gold
This song is so great, unfortunately for me however I took years of Latin and know that it's supposed to be pronounced Regg-ee-uh, not Ree-jah, which ruins it a bit for me :(. "Reg" as in "regular", and "ia" as in "Mafia". G's are never pronounced as J's in Latin, because Latin straight up doesn't use the "J" sound. Also it's missing a macron - Aqua Rēgia. Nerd rant over :P.
Discovered Sleep Token a couple of weeks ago after getting back into Prog. Metal... Always thought that rock today in general was in a "mid-life crisis" spell as I'd not heard anything as new or exciting as, well, this... "Saturate me I can't get enough" is v ample here as I haven't been able to stop listening to their Vore/TMBTE projects!
Fenomenal ❤
❤😂😮 It is a nice little kick to it too
One of my favorite singers of sleep token is always gonna be will remain whoever likes in texting back
This song is about a talk show host making his guests really uncomfortable
This is the perfect music for writing a dark romance!
So no one else gets a drug addiction story line from this? Like heroin?
I want a Sleep Token signature scent and for it to be called Aqua Regio.
This reminds me of a certain FF14  music and it's tugging on the nostalgia strings hardcore. It's the jazzy/bluesy piano for me.
This voice!
What Durden said to Jack in the beginning of Fight Club, "A moment is all you can expect from perfection". Damn.
Leo, I hope you know how powerful these songs of yours are. Between you and Adam, that's damn near perfect, PERFECT songwriting. Just understand that your new songs, and old, hold much, much power. It's almost unbelievable. Good on you guys. Good on you.    Reply
I haven't been this obsessed since MCR in 2005 lmao
A solid, tall bar of Most Replayed moments
plz, keep it metal
do like the piano ..
Agent love you sleep token 🖤🖤🖤
Come to Brazil❤
Rigia…
I am OBSESSED with this song
This that baby makin music ngl
My favourite song atm. It hits so different
I cannot get this melody out of my head.
I can’t really explain how their music is able to help me through the constant struggle of life. It’s almost like their music is away for me to escape from reality
The song writer was a chemistry student?
2:47 that's the good stuff right there
Im listening to TMBTE through headphones for the first time. I'm even more in love than I was before . I didnt think it was possible.  ❤
'Between the pain and the way you look/I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook'  FML that hits so hard.
Just picked up their new album on vinyl is fantastic
Glad this band exist, this is my favorite track. The whole album is a masterpiece in all aspects. Ty Sleep Token.
Finally discovered this band. Wtf is wrong with me
This is just perfection in audio format... The whole album just flows so cleanly... Aqua regia is a great name for a song too ;)
This song really calms me down whenever I get bouts of anxiety.
Post Malone meets Meshuggah
so a husk formed
"Ohh and I am done dancing to alarm bells, No wonder my ears are still ringing And I am done fighting off change, No wonder my arms are still swinging"  Aqua Regia / a mixture of concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids. It is a highly corrosive liquid able to attack gold and other resistant substances , Its ability to dissolve gold and other so-called noble metals... Oh sleep token,  I feel for you
I’m obsessed with this song😢
Karaoke version: https://youtube.com/watch?v=2ZbpYnapcRw
I love your music it reminds me of my dad🎾
👀
Px😊
Is t that a shiva statue ?
Truly modern alchemy. Such a great line in "putting down the roses, picking up the sword" . Exquisite.  W O R S H I P
Sonoooo
That piano in their sound like gospel
To say Vessel has an amazing voice is a gross understatement...His voice touches the soul :)
Hitting All the Right💖🎶Notes🎶💖
"Putting down the Roses, Picking Up the Sword" "Oh and I am done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing" "And I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging"  I love these lyrics.
Oh Yes❣️🔥❣️ stop fighting, let go and Transform. There is no death only transformation. I LOVE this band.
What an epic track. Finally pure musical talent.
im inspired by sleep token its the best
This dude must love 90’s-00’s video games
2:45
I just listened to it like 2 hours on repeat. It's a fucking masterpiece. Thank you sleep token <3
I love those chemistry references AAAAA.
Half blood... Lol nope. Your an original
This is just beautiful. Between the silky mess of his voice, the lyrics, the piano, the keyboard, the pace, the beat… it’s just beautiful and it’s SO underrated… CRIMINALLY underrated.
Sorry im a sleep token newbie… do these guys cover every genre of music? if they do…well im on board! Damn they different n whats needed! Im hooked
Anyone here from the Modern Warfare fic?
Back from the future! Really cool album guys 🎉
I  found your music through Nik Nocturnal's modern metal playlist. And thank god I love this song
❤
A chronic zeppelin fan told me that they thought this was s*** music I think i'm getting divorced
Idk who this is but I like this
worship
A few weeks ago my boyfriend went into the hospital. (he is okay now) This was the first time something this serious has happened in out relationships, and I couldn’t bring myself to ever go into the hospital because I was so scared something would go terribly wrong so I listened to this song and just cried to this part  2:47
Good song
Delishmus moosics ♥
I wish this song would keep going and never end.
Guys for real come on, your newest tour supporting TMBTE has you playing everywhere on the globe EXCEPT CANADA? Seriously? Not 1 show even here in Toronto
This band sounds like someone said "Bastille, but also Tool"
Great band
Ah, yes, spooky Post Malone.
Was their lead man a chemist before getting into the music game or something?
Yeah... I have a problem, I can't stop listening to this song.
Nice! Serious Donkey Kong Country vibes.
This song is the definition and embodiment of audio gold. Quite simply a masterpiece. 😭😍
This song is my absolute favourite. Very unique and artistic, love it.
Lyrics Well, my love is an animal call Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls Between teeth on a broken jaw Following a bloodtrail, frothing at the maw These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford The perfect start to a perfect war Putting down the roses picking up the sword Aqua Regia Aqua Regia Well, my past is a holy book A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook Between the pain and the way you look I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook These days I'm a picture frame Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain Out of Eden's vices running through my veins Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of When I am done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing And I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of
This band created its own genre 😮
The sheer amount of literal chemistry in this album is sublime
Hey, I use aqua regia to recycle electronic scrap. Nice. I like this band. Great lyrics.
I'm jamming along to this on drums before work this morning.   Never heard this band or these songs before, so I'm just improving along, and we both switch to the ride cymbal near the middle of the tune.   I paused to mention because this stuff is really tippy and cool. I though the occurrence was a fun coincidence!
Love this song. Also idk why but around 1:05 reminds me of around 0:37 of Super Villain - Stileto & Silent Child
This is my song when having sex
Good song but i'm not really feeling the singer.
New Sleep Token listener here. Open to recommendations from long time fans and others more educated than me.  I’m kinda stuck on this song tho.  The chord extensions and jazz/soul sounds are speaking directly to me.  Awesome record!
Ok I love that jazzy chorus that's refreshing
Just heard this song today....me likey❤😊
傑作
Jesus, the mix on this thing is loud as shit. It peaks really bad which is kinda cool, but you miss out on some cool dynamics.
This song is so refreshing it's like taking a bath without actually taking a bath. 😰
Babies will be made tonight!
This song is sexy as hell dude
Once upon a time, in the infinite expanse of the cosmos, a profound cosmic event occurred. It was a convergence of cosmic energies, a celestial collision of unimaginable magnitude. This cataclysmic event birthed a being known as Vessel, a being of extraordinary talent and creativity, destined to shape the very fabric of the universe.  "As I awoke, so did the cosmos," whispered the universe in awe, as Vessel emerged, their presence reverberating across the cosmos. "This world was never ours to keep," Vessel sang, their ethereal voice resonating with the very essence of creation, stirring galaxies to dance and stars to sing in celestial unison.  Vessel's music transcended the boundaries of existence, captivating all who encountered its otherworldly melodies. "The night does not wait for me," they sang, a haunting melody that echoed through the cosmic void, igniting a cosmic symphony of wonder and introspection.  As time passed, Vessel's artistry reached unparalleled heights. "The offering is made," they declared, each composition becoming a profound offering to the universe itself. Their creations became the soundtrack of the cosmos, the universal language through which beings across countless galaxies found solace, joy, and profound connection.  However, with each note sung by Vessel, the fabric of the universe began to unravel. The sheer intensity of their creative force, while magnificent, unknowingly brought about unintended consequences. The cosmic energies that had birthed Vessel were drawn into a perpetual state of imbalance, causing disturbances throughout the cosmos.  "The night drives me forward," Vessel realized, a realization dawning upon them amidst the cosmic chaos. They understood the immense power their art held, a power that, if left unchecked, would consume the universe. With great sorrow and resolve, Vessel made the ultimate sacrifice.  In a moment of cosmic transfiguration, Vessel released their final symphony, pouring every ounce of their being into a single, resplendent crescendo. "And with this life, I lay it all to rest," they sang, their voice carrying the weight of both sorrow and transcendence. The universe quivered, resonating with the sheer magnitude of the moment.  And as the final note reverberated through the cosmos, Vessel dissipated into the very essence from which they were born. "Take my voice," they whispered, their essence merging with the universal energies, dispersing throughout the cosmic tapestry.  With Vessel's sacrifice, the universe was brought to its ultimate culmination. Time ceased to exist, and the remnants of existence slowly faded away. The cosmos, having achieved its purpose in birthing and witnessing the brilliance of Vessel, began its descent into eternal silence.  Yet, within that silence, whispers of Vessel's melodies echoed throughout the void, eternal reminders of the profound impact they had on the universe. "This offering is enough," their echoes whispered, their sacrifice forever etched in the cosmic memory.  And so, the universe met its end, not with sorrow or regret, but with a profound sense of fulfillment. Vessel's legacy remained woven into the cosmic tapestry, their artistry becoming a beacon of inspiration for new realms and civilizations yet to be born.  And as the remnants of the universe drifted into eternal slumber, the echoes of Vessel's music whispered through the cosmos, a testament to the cosmic cycle of creation, brilliance, and ultimate transcendence. "And now, we rest," the echoes murmured, a lullaby to the fading cosmic symphony.
this song deserved a repeat of the last chorus omg we were robbed
Albums amazing, still my favourite though
True magic. Like master chefs there is no ingredient left off the table. They are woven into flavors that surprise and delight if you have no preconceived notions. This album has filled up my soul with what it needed so desperately. Worship
This is just epic.  So much wow.
Did anyone else catch the lyrical callback to Dark Signs?.. orrrrr
Lyrics: Well, my love is an animal call Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls Between teeth on a broken jaw Following a bloodtrail, frothing at the maw These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford The perfect start to a perfect war Putting down the roses picking up the sword  Aqua Regia Aqua Regia  Well, my past is a holy book A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook Between the pain and the way you look I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook These days I'm a picture frame Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain Out of Eden's vices running through my veins  Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of  When I am done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing And I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging  Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of
As a 100% straight male I have to say that at 2:47 my panties dropped...
Conheci a banda a poucos dias, e é incrivel a qualidade de som desses caras. Parabéns pelo trabalho.
Holy guacamole this song is awesome
So this band is like, psychedelic, progressive, funky, jazz-hop metal?  Have I gotten every genre on the new album yet?
Yesss he sings in cursive
i never heard anything like this, its the same feeling i got when i started reading the king in yellow.
sleep token got me through a really dark time in my life, alot of betrayal and just such a bittersweet taste left, music like this is meant to find beauty in the toxicity, negativity, and discomfort we all experience.
Fkn goosebumps awesome great feeling
aqua fina
Please come to new zealand I would be so honnored to be in your presence Vessel, your voice is just pure heaven
Any booktok girls on here that also love sleeptoken and thinks this could be the theme song to Haunting Adeline?
WORSHIP
I am so excited for this album to drop. This song hits so hard. Can't wait to be vibing with the windows down on a warm summer night 🫠
Forth song in. Still on this new journey. I'll listen to a couple more
2:48 is that TLC (no scrubs)? Please say yes
Someone: What's your favourite genre of music?  Me: Sleep Token.
Love this song. Can't wait for the whole album drop. Loving this other band too:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_l3Al6BiANOKX6JpT6QO9THjS-LDGoZ9Gs
Please tell me I am not the only one that said Aquafina, and now everytime I keep singing it aqua Fina 😂😂
I would like to thank Will Ramos for covering chokehold or I would have never know about this band. I'm a metal head, but I am in love with Sleep Token
Amazing i Love ❤❤sleep token ❤❤
I haven't bought a physical CD in a long time...
Keep it up Sleep Token, this isn't even your final form.
I didn't know music could make me feel. Just feel.
my god, this is so unbelievably good. best band I have heard the last 30 years
This song is a whole vibe ❤
Sleep Token is my latest BIG time discovery after Periphery 10 years ago. Love this song to death and most of the other songs too <3
recently found these guys and im so glad i did! such a great sound!
Just recently discovered them, this is probably my favorite song ever right now! 😊
why cant i stop listening to this and other songs from this album. ahhh!!
i still have no idea why i tear up during the bridge of this song. every damn time.
😅😊
Hypnotic song... on repeat mode
Mesmerizing,  I can’t even figure out how else to describe how strong this band, this song, this voice, this music, visuals, lyrics, has got a hold of me
Their lyrics are on another level.
I'm so mad and yet happy I'm finely discovering sleep token all their music Ive herd has been a fuckin vibe
Baby making music
This band just hit the nail on the head with such a swagger I’ve never heard before. Holy phuck
Great song! It should over a million likes!
This band's layers get deeper & deeper the more i invest in them.
I'm obsessed with them discovered them today 😭😭😭😭😭💘
Play this during your sexy time with your significant other. You won't be displeased
When this album comes out it deserves a Grammy. No they are too good for a Grammy. I don’t know but I wish more people knew about them
Masterpiece
This is corny?
This album is going to be responsible for so many pregnancies.
Oxytocin running in the ether
Flabbergasted
Gah chemistry/science references mixed in with a nasty beat? Gotta love sleep token man, from Alkaline science to this now. Keep up the nerd references ya.
Thanks Will Ramos.Again, through acts and recommendatino, you continue to make my life richer. This is amazing!
Man I can't wait for Will Ramos to cover this song. I just know he will do it sooooooooo much better. This version is alright tho
All unreal....❤
I hope they're coming to Hungary once....
Is it me or does this sound like hosier
Hey, ST... if y'all by chance scroll through comments. I just wanted to thank you all for putting out music. I especially enjoy Aqua Regia: it scratches my brain in all the right places . I hope yall never stop making music ❤ It's pure art .  Thank you, Vessel, ii , iii, and iiii
I know what aqua regia is because of nilered. i wonder if he listens to sleep token
one main reason I am buying Aftershock tickets this year is these guys
If this song doesn't break into the Pop Charts I'm gonna be sad
Sleep on the piano: _"🎹🎶 It's all good 👍 🎶"_  The Alagaddian/SCP: 🦑
Great newer band! Cant wait fill they come mpls!!!
At first I wasn’t too into the title as refrain but this one grew on me (like all ST songs). I didn’t dislike the song but I…refrained from really liking it for a bit. Eventually I let this melt me into a gold puddle. I do enjoy the alchemical transmutation; dissolution of the most ideal, noble, perfect metal.
mind blown.
I was searching for something melodic with heavy drums / sound and you fill just that gap, loooove this
Pulled over one the side of the A40 to just say how fucking happy I am to hear this of the radio at last!! Finally something good to listen to❤
The hall reference gets me everytime. “I’m on tv talking like it’s just you and me.” - everytime.
You can liberate sound when you become as music itself
I don't normally dig unless I'm super into them, but can someone please point me towards the very first attempt made by sleep token at a song?
I wish I could become good at making music because I could make a bangin cover to this song I will not lie dog…
Just finally listened to this band for the first time after telling myself I should listen to them for months. Gotta say I'm blown away. I can't remember the last time I've heard a band that's given me goosebumps, can't wait to dig into more
Aqua Regia is a chemical mixture that is commonly used to remove noble metals such as gold, platinum and palladium from substrates  Oxytocin acts as a chemical messenger and has an important role in many human behaviours including sexual arousal, recognition, trust, romantic attachment and mother–infant bonding.  Silicon is a hard, brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic luster, said to bring peace, grace and joy to those around it.   Subatomic means smaller than an atom.   Acid flux is essentially a process used to clean and protect the area where two pieces of metal are joined together.
This is just incredibly tasty... <3
the first time I heard it I thought Aqua Regia is something romantic 😅😂, actually it's far from it
I don't get the hype for these 🤷
Those ghost notes though....... tasty
This song needs another 3 minutes so I can keep vibing to it 😊
I never tough a word silicon could sound so sexy 🙈 😅 ❤️‍🔥🔥🔥
Where are the lyrics
This is so cool and interesting! Glad I found Sleep Token.
This song has such potential to be apart of a new/old Final Fantasy Theme Song ! Esp. FF-X/2
t.r.u.e.
Me da exactamente igual el lugar al que vayáis en España, me planto el primero.
I found you guys through Will Ramos' vocal cover of Chokehold. I am pleased to say I am now a fan!!
Everything put onto this song is very calculated.
Im here for Loathe, this is a gorgeous band!
bring the ritual to Brasil, we'll worship devoutly
Love the vibe!
the visuals at the beginning are cool but make more sense if you look into what aqua Regia actually is.. nitrohydrocloric acid
I wish I could show this to a girl I like for the first time.
The *most replayed part* indeed. GGEZ
awesome
This song is an eargasm
This has to be one of the most beautiful songs I've heard in a long time that piano is just amazing and vessels words powerful and soulful pierce you right to the soul god this album has been phenomenal so far so stoked for the entire album this is a masterpiece
Can not tell you how many times I have listened to this song in the past 3 days
First time listening, n they r really freaking good.
I need the album now please
My mind is fuckin blown, well done!
Idk if anyone has said it before but sleep token is imagine dragons if they made good music.
YES
2:50 ish... wow
billie eilish wannabe
Janitor got the keys, I got the hooks, my eyes not glued to a false book
Vessel needs to be put on a pedestal.  How is his voice always soooo perfect. Ugh! Worship!
These guys know music theory
Everyone gangsta till the piano solo kicks in 2:15
You guys are saving my boyfriend's life everyday giving him some kind of hope. His birthday is 17th march, this month. If it's possible, it would be amazing if you answer or even like this comment. Seriously. I love him so much and I'm thankful for Sleep Token. 🖤
I’m a massive metal head I’m late 30s and have listened to many genres over the years but never thought there would be a band that impressed me as much since took in the 90s these guys are impressive ….either that or I’m getting soft in my old age lol
This band is so underrated
Blade Runner vibes. 🥶
bro i was studying science and searched what aqua regia was and i came across this banger song lmao
I really like the piano playing in the background
Quien vino por shaun?
As a non newbie to this band I love their new progressions and they never disappoint
Damn you! This has been stuck in my head for toooo long Thank you, great song!
0:38 cream cheese on a broken jaw
one of the best instrumentals I've ever heard. the piano bit was so beautiful. everything hit so hard
Could have done without the stock “Hey” on every beat. Sticks out like a sore thumb.
🔥🔥
This is so awesome. Why would you ruin it by playing rock music it's literally the worst genre ever
this band blows my mind
Sleep Token is officially the first metal band to make baby making music.
You go rude boy, you spit those those mad flows.
Tour in America FOR THE LOV EOR CHRIST
WHEN WILL YOU BE IN AMERICA
Sleep token is the exact reason that other musicians need to back off reactors. I would of never found out about them and I worship everyday since.
Spotify played me this after listening to Paramore.  Me likey!
This songs vibe is like having headphones on watching the sunset near the ocean. So beautiful. Worship.
When the piano comes in at the perfect moment, this song is just pure sexiness.
Listing to this song isn't enough i need it in me
yo thats the best song i`ve ever heard
Can anyone recommend songs like this?  The smoothness hits different
just was awakened to this group. Unreal.
Your music makes me feel like I’m being passionately caressed and I’m obsessed 🥰❤️
Listening to this song is my lullaby
I love how the dj0nts aren't a gimmick in this band. They knew it would have not worked with this song so they didn't do it.
fucking perfect
This band is really what the industry needed to kinda reset. It's palatable for casual listeners but the lighter prettier side of dark and deep. Really digging this band.
I've only heard 2 other songs from this band that were pretty metal/alt, but this one resonates with me super hard. (I like the other 2 as well) but what genre / style would this song be called? I'm looking for similar sounding music because I like the flow and chill, but can't really search for a genre idk the name of. Would any kind stranger be able to help?
This....this is a banger ngl. Literally a song to sleep to under a sea of stars. A true masterpiece, and ik this album os gonna be a banger to start 2023
Musical perfection.
ok, I think I'm officially addicted to Sleep Token
2:17 Whatever this is, please. More of it. So sexy
Seker die malste stuk musiek wat jou alles op eet! Fantasties!!! Sexy so fkn sexy!
eargasms!!!!!!
this song is so beautiful ugh
how the fuck do we go from this straight into vore
I think I need an oxygen tank, this is indescribably delightful❤️‍🔥
If Imagine Dragons went prog metal.
Listening to Aqua Regia disolves you better than actual "3:1 mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid" (that is actual aqua regia)
What a freaking amazing band
I can proudly say that this is now my father's gateway metal band hahahah
Nitric and Sulphuric acid to separate gold from other base metals. I like how this is jazzy R&B. This band continues to surprise and impress me!
What is this? Is it an AI Band? What is this? I'm scared.
What have you done boys❤️‍🔥? It is difficult to work, difficult to sleep, difficult to take care about kids, almost impossible to study🙃 ...hypnotysed by your music ...and I didnt found yet balance between Space and Earth since I found you 2 weeks ago😁. Somebody tell me it will go to the end someday and I will come back to my normal life🫣😀?
sleep token came into my life at the right time, it's never too late for their music! but gosh i wish i had found them sooner, every single song they put out is just so amazing, words can't describe them at all!  and the song writing is just so so poetic, and every single melody is just really, a masterpiece and blended so well together. blessed to have found you guys ❤️
Yeah sleep token is fucking sweet never would’ve found them if it wasn’t for my EDI the day before graduation on Parris Island thanks SSGT
I dare you to try and pinpoint their music genre. Hahaha impossible. 🔥🔥🔥
Easily my favorite single they've released so far. Incredibly excited for the new album
Came here from the goons podcast cause ive never heard of yall. safe to say they were right yall are amazing!
gender fluid… pardon… genre fluid band
It's been 3 weeks since this release, we need more!
i very love this song
if i ever get diagnosed with tinnitus, just know it's sleep token's fault for having a bomb ass discography
Aqua Regia is nitric and hydrochloric acid mixed and it can dissolve gold. It’s Royal Water.   It was discovered on a second journey to follow Nicholas Flamel to find the Philosohers stones. It was discovered by accident by Jabir ibn Al-Hayya when he mixed salt and sulfuric acid 😵‍💫😵‍💫  He was an alchemist and it’s thought to be a water Flamel himself deemed the solvent of life. It can COMPLETELY dissolve gold. And while neither compound can touch gold on its own, mixed together it’s deadly to the metals ☺️☺️  Thanks for coming to my Ted talk!!
Lord these chord progressions heal all my soul bro. First time hearing the pre chorus and chorus my ears nutted for the first time in a while. From the rich cluster harmonies starting on the F#maj7 to the transitional C natural from the C#min7 - Bmin7. My ears have been rejuvenated.
Every song I listen to of theirs just gets better and better
I love all your song !
Everytime I see that Sleep Token has put out a new song/visualizer, I'm so pumped first and foremost for the badass ingenuity and awesome song that I'll listen too.... but also to see what dark souls boss they will create next!
Help, I'm addicted to Sleep Token.
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
It's beautiful when bands incorporate the piano in to the songs.
If one good thing has come from TikTok, its these guys getting more recognition. Absolutely incredible. Worship.
Worship
Love how they can just make all of these different styles and genres sound so great. Just found out about this band for a an epic heavy song and then this one on a totally different end of music is also amazing. Well done
His voice is just so 😩😩😩
I'm calling it your drummer is Luke Holland
Adam pedder is the drummer !!
just found them yesterday... I'm blown away its like a better version of the dude who sings take me to church.... for metalheads and everyone
Damn...sexy chord progressions.
I listen to a lot of heavy music. I feel like these songs speak to my soul. I never felt so emotions from a band. I like this band a lot
love it🥰🥰🥰🥰
These guys don't release bad music. Everything is so damn good.
I hope they stay anonymous. I’d be nice if they put up the lyrics so we can all sing along.
The Sleep Token hype train is real!!!
So happy I saw Sleep Token in small venues before the implosion that is currently in flow implodes
A band that will unify the clans.
Today i found this band,wtf is so nice....💥💣
"Agua. Regis. Oxycodone floodin' my urethra."  Lyrics are speaking to my soul.
This song... "Saturate me I can't get enough"
I didnt think Sleep TOken was for me when i first listened but after hearing this i got how ridiculously good they are despite the genre not being something i would normally go for. As "Vessel" Said "Life is dark. Life is bright. Life is ugly. Life is beautiful. Don’t get lost in genres, they’ll only disorientate you. Music is for everyone.”
This is the best Hozier song that Bastille ever made
I'm just discovering this music and I enjoy it. I do not enjoy people calling it metal.
That piano note step-up reminds me of 2pac "I ain't mad at ya" love it. They covered outkast... wonder if it's a hip hop influence?
The number of goth women receiving fellatio just skyrocketed
Am I the only one who hears Cinema by Benny Benassi in the melody?
Imagine Dragons got masks now
why were these songs taken off of apple music!!!???? WHAT THE HECK DUDE
Anyone else feel like they're losing control over their body when they listen to this song? I can't handle how good it is. The intelligence in the lyrics is unparalleled to any other band I've come across. O B S E S S E D!!   Hopefully will get to experience it live when I see them in April!
is this a remake of another song sounds so familiar lol
I don't think people really knows how deep this band is. A lot think the lyrics are about a lover, it might have some, but it's mostly about self love. The internal fights we have with our higher self, our inner child, etc. This is about I Am, We are. We have also our pains, sufferings, fears, resentments, and we must face everything. Our true self is waiting for us. Our true divine, The divine is guiding us. Alkaline is the perfect description of what that force is.
chemists? 👀
This song is so good, the last 60-70 seconds or so are genuinely unreal
Just to add.. IF that's why they named it, Aqua Regia is a chemical combination of HCL and HN03 strong enough to dissolve gold for gold refining
Sheer Genius. W O R S H I P.
Music video makes no sense.
My new ear candy band.. cause holy crap you guys are GOOD.
I feel bad for those who havent heard this masterpiece They're just to good to be true
this song scratches my brain in all the right places
this is song is about sex…
Its a masterpiece❤️✨💯
Id like to apologize to my brain and my ears for not finding this band sooner
Found y’all through TikTok (no offense 😂) and may I just say… this is a GREAT SONG! 😍
I still remember when I discover this band
I never heard of this band until 66Samus received a strike from YouTube for playing drums to one of their songs on a live-stream... why would you (or your label) seek to prevent someone from spreading awareness of your music?!?!?  (he has 5x the subscribers as this band... you should be thanking him for the advert)
When are you guys coming to the U.S? I'm seriously excited to see you guys live here. There is no other band that comes close to the music you guys make. I swear I would save up all of my money to see you guys in Charleston WV.
Lyrics:  Well, my love is an animal call Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls Between teeth on a broken jaw Following a bloodtrail, frothing at the maw These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford The perfect start to a perfect war Putting down the roses picking up the sword Aqua Regia Aqua Regia Well, my past is a holy book A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook Between the pain and the way you look I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook These days I'm a picture frame Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain Out of Eden's vices running through my veins Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of When I am done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing And I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of
This song make me fly…..
Outstanding how they can make a piano sound heavy as hell
Aqua Fina Love these guys, just couldn't help it tho lol
if Halsey has a Man's voice
I'm so happy to live in the exact time and place to hear this masterpiece. Thank you
I bet most of the fanatic's are gen z's. Too much drama and corny stuff . More like influencers not a real band
Me declaro fan nueva.
Reminds me of the first time I heard “ smells like teen spirit “  So different from everything else
"These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford". These lyrics are just outstanding!.
Well, my love is an animal call Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls Between teeth on a broken jaw Following a bloodtrail, frothing at the maw These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford The perfect start to a perfect war Putting down the roses picking up the sword Aqua Regia Aqua Regia Well, my past is a holy book A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook Between the pain and the way you look I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook These days I'm a picture frame Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain Out of Eden's vices running through my veins Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of When I am done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing And I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of
Amazing depth of styles... the choice of ambient sounds and vocal tones are truly able to paint an emotional masterpiece. You guys are phenomenal
album when
this a banger fr
Just discovered these guys and im honestly impressed and i hope they get the recognition they deserve.
This song has been stuck in my head since it came out >~<
Perfect bro
Sl33p T0k3N is a gift  2 humanity . stay spiritual
Where’s the synthesia at?? Dying to learn this but learning by ear is so daunting with these jazzy chords
This after a brutal dose of Infant Annihilator... I am complete 🖤
Does anyone know what the genre of music would be called for the piano solo verse? I’m obsessed with it. I keep playing the song over and over to hear that part. (I love the whole song and am a huge fan of sleep token) but that solo piece with the piano and like ballroom dancing vibes scratches a piece of my Brain to the point of tears
I disagree that in the lyric's bridge, the first line says, '... alarm bells' and instead says '... a long buzz', like he drank too much and danced. idk if the lyrics have been officially published by the artist, but I felt that this sounded more apt given Vessel's vocals and the breadth in which he sings the elongations. Truly interpretive.
Loving the “From Software” vibes on these
FODA. Sleep Token ta sendo a melhor banda que to ouvindo nos ultímos dias/meses, bom demais
Well, my love is an animal call Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls Between teeth on a broken jaw Following a bloodtrail, frothing at the maw These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford The perfect start to a perfect war Putting down the roses picking up the sword  Aqua Regia Aqua Regia  Well, my past is a holy book A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook Between the pain and the way you look I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook These days I'm a picture frame Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain All of Eden's vices running through my veins  Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of  Oh and I am done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing And I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging  Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of
So what's the big deal with these peeps? I don't hear it. But maybe this just isn't the song for me. I'll check out other songs. The almighty algorithm is telling me I need to like this, so I'm going to like it no matter what.
I wish I had a sleep token, I'm tired
I'm so in hype for this new album!
Leo <3
Dont really like this one
My new girl got me on, I’m… impressed.
Ufff es una chulada, padrinos!
Too sexy vibes as usual
I think I've listened to this song at least 3 times a day since it was released. I CANNOT wait until this new album drops.

That bridge never fails to make me emotional. Fantastic work.
These lyrics are something else
WOW
UH, yes.
sleep token casually teasing the new Elden Ring DLC bosses early
They should release miniature versions of all these monsters. STL for 3d printing, or the actual resin mini.
At first i was like w t f and concluded with "eh, kids these days..." Few week later and algorithms bringing me back - i'm hooked. I always loved crossovers and all kinds of genres but never thought i needed this. Just want to point out the quality of lyrics. Even if the production and everything was this good it wouldn't slap this hard without lyrics crafted as well as they are.
Are they too intellectual and musically diverse to break huge? I don't care, this band is my new eargasm...
Holy waaah
Hosier
pls come to Torontooooo
This is they^re best Song to date. Dont tell me otherwise.
I'ma need Sleep Token to hit up Montreal. They're pushing the envelope and I'm living for it.
Blowing up at last
These lyrics are doooooope
Wtf. Saw an article saying these guys were great... this is awful
Dont get the hype. At all. Singer sounds horrible live from every vid i’ve seen 😂
I had a random recommendation from a channel (Alex Hefner) that I didn't even subscribe to. Glad I listened to it.  i love what I have heard so far
This is what top 40 radio wishes it was
Just saw y'all on a reaction vid.... I'm hooked!😍
you guys are Imagine Dragons in "goth" attire?  seriously...you are right?
I wish I'd heard them sooner.  The feeling is visceral. They manifest with words.  I don't know how else to say it. When I finally realized this is alchemy 😲
Sleep token, more like Slap Token
Love this band. Got the last cd in 2022 and haven't stopped listening since I got it.
Won’t you stop making me cry. Or you know what just go ahead make me pour my heart out
To the people that claim you can't become a mainstream act releasing rock/metal in today's music industry, I give you Sleep Token. It proves that if a band writes phenomenal and catchy music, the fans will come. From 200k monthly listeners to 1.4 million in a week...WORSHIP!
SLEEP TOKEN - now is the most confusing band to explain to someone!
It’s like if a cloud of comfort is blowing in your face.
Perfect offering.
Wow it’s so nice to see a new band that actually makes good music crazy right
The beginning of the video reminds me of Harry Potter. In Belatrix vault at Gringotts
A friend recommended these guys yesterday and haven't stopped listening to them since. Great band, great sound, great tracks. Their success is so well deserved.
I was suggested this band by a friend and I'm so damn glad she did, they are the band of the year this year especially with the songs they have been bringing out in the last month, what a great start to the year! Beautiful visual storytelling, great vocals and a great way to switch their songs up masterfully
Chorus:  You are, a Cinema,  A Hollywood treasure  Action, Thriller,  I could watch you forever   You're welcome you'll never unhear it .... If I have to suffer, so do you.
WORSHIP
NO NO NOOO NOWAY ITSJUST NO WAAY. HOW? HIS IT….??? THATS OMGGG NO NO NO WAY!
Very good. I just hope ST doesn’t bounce around genres too much to not have a defined sound
Anyone else thought they heard their Windows 10 @ 1:24 ? 😂
Love this!
the piano reminds me of some of the music from Bayonetta lmao
If I find a woman that makes me feel half the way this music does, I'll know I've found true love
yooooooo
This is the most sonically pleasing song possibly ever... this album better burn down everything
This group gets better every track the release.
My first subscribe of 23 and I’m so happy it was Sleep Token and I can say I’m a new fan
Fascinating.   They literally just controlled my emotions.  I actually cried. But out of my love for music and the woman I'm so proud to have beside me
I have had this song stuck in my head since I woke up lol.
Album of the year
The Songs gives me the asthetics of a beautiful Girl walking in slow mo at the pool...you feel that too?
I heard The Summoning on Octane and fell in love with them. Their music is so unique and different. Listen on and Worship!
That piano is straight up baby-making toneage. Song structure/riffing reminds me of a dark Zelliack lol.
i cannot explain why i love this song but its honestly layered like a cake so many textures so much vibrance within one song it is amazing, vessels vocals have so many lows and highs and lyricism is cryptic and sets a tone of a lost lover as vessel carry's through the song you can just feel the emotional shifts eb and flow
So this is my introduction to Sleep Token. I listened to the other singles also released in 2023 and then This Place Will.. after aqua. I'm impressed with the musicianship, lyrics and most importantly (For me at least) the production on these new singles ESPECIALLY Aqua. Sounds like it belongs in a 007 Intro. Sleep Token, you have my attention.
immaculate as always. worship.. 🖤
The off key is so on key, best new metal genre of modern day infancy,  left to grow and brew to bigger amazing new metal twists and turns, originating from the greats, I hear it! Loud and proud but original, much love ❤️ respect and absolute belief in sleep token
This sounds like a male Lady Gaga....
I love this so much!!
Just found this band like about a million other people. I love that they absolutely disregard the idea of genres and formula. I'm a metalhead but I love having a diverse sound and these guys do just that to a massive degree.
Lvndmark thank you for playing this on your stream. Without you i wouldnt be able to find such a good band
Hozier meets metalcore
so refreshing. years ago my taste evolved from deftones via tool, then sludge bands like isis, to meshuggah. after discovering meshuggah there was nothing that really had the same kind of overwhelming/ecstatic effect on me, so i moved on to other types of music. i jokingly claimed that meshuggah killed rock for me. sleep token gives me the exact same feeling that i had back when i started discovering music as a kid.   btw, 2:20 - those lounge sounds in the back. it would be a blast to have a dinner to such a live act, kek.
Dear gawd, I can hear the auto tune 🤮
100k subscribers <3
This year is gonna be gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
2:17 i felt like i was in a Gran Turismo menu
I searched Aqua regia formation for my chemistry class but here am I, I had no idea!
I was waiting for the drop and for the distortion guitars to lift it to the next genre of epic...but loved the song :)
I'm ready for this.. The world is not.
That bass line timing and the 7ths are just ridiculous.
It's crazy sometimes I don't even want to listen to their music because I know I won't be able to digest it's greatness
this album is godly so far
I'm so in love with the chord choices here
Perfection as usual :)
WORSHIP
Otherworldly <3 For anyone who likes this sound i think it highly resembles sukekiyo's sound https://youtu.be/SuT5sJlOiLQ
To me me in their own way that's not totally similar but. They give off vibes of starset.  Me likey
This shot is awful. Imagine dragons did it better and they suck
Perfection.
Yooooo this playing with my feelings sleeptoken stahp
Sorry but this isn’t prog rock or metal it’s Emo to the core
Can be music any better than that ? (except fort Soundgarden...)
Not for me but I thought I'd give em a few listens first.
Just discovered this band last night,  been binge watching them since. Def a fan now👌
I don't understand. Reas about this band on a article about the best metal songs of 2023...this isn't metal?
I am sorry and what is your holly book?  there one out of desert?
This song slaps! This is definitely my favorite song by them. It's poppy, jazzy, rappy, and still Rock. Perfect mix of many genres.
BROO WHO HURT YOU AND WHY WE DESERVE THE NICE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT
Djazz
super intelligent lyrics !!!
This song is a nope for me. The first 2 drops were bangers. This one has too much R&B influence for my liking. To each their own.
How am i only just hearing these, some1 gimmie some background guys......holy shit, love it
Aqua Regia - is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3. Aqua regia is a fuming liquid. Freshly prepared aqua regia is colorless, but it turns yellow, orange or red within seconds from the formation of nitrosyl chloride and nitrogen dioxide. It was named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum, though not all metals.
The visuals and the piano give me Jenova vibes
Nope...
Take me back to Eden already
I've heard of Sleep Token before, but this month was the first time I listened to their music. No need for any other album to be released this year. Sleep Token is dropping AOTY.
I’ve had this song on repeat since Thursday
my ears are happy.
Ghost+Katatonia?
This band is a absolute masterpiece
This gives me FFXIV dungeon vibes. I love it.
I‘m obsessed with this dudes… this is beyond beautiful 🥹♥️
This is just Skrillex Cinema, change my mind
I’m back to say it again. There is definitely an album being dropped this year! Still calling it! Still stand by it!   Worship
It's a fitting name for this beautiful track SLEEP does it again.  Aqua regia is a chemical compound used to clean gold . ...but it can also dissolve gold. ...very fitting I love it. These progressions are jazzy too. They truly are like a box of chocolates you don't ever know what you're gonna get with them. Ever. ❤️❤️❤️❤️👽
Don't. fuck up. 'Cause even the Devil loves ya.
I loved these in Birmingham. What a band!!!!
2:17 DUDE
sorry sleep token.  i literally wept listening to one & two as if it were a distant memory.  the unique feeling from hit old works are no longer evident.  i remember the first time i was in your presence in 2019 when the sundowning dropped.  i wish time can be turned back.
the piano in the background ruined it a bit I think during the main aqua regia chorus. if it was guitar and drums would have been lit. still a great song though. not hating
This has no business being this good
Aqua Regia - a mixture of concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids. It is a highly corrosive liquid that will dissolve gold and other resistant substances.
what if Vessel 2 is George Daniel from The 1975
Miss their heavy vibe  Re: gods  Sundowning
Sleep Token is ruining other music for me
cant lie, this sounds like pop music, with metal/rock undertones.  is this is pop prog/metalcore?  Appealing to the masses with the radio friendly pop-ish choruses but, throwing in some heavy interludes here and there for the heavy clout.
ayyyyyyyyy I'm  new here but has been an amazing ride this is a fucking vibe
this is disgusting in all the best ways
que vibe meo
I'm crying at new releases, legitimately no other artist has done this to me.
I love this band holy f
YouTube Taylor Marie brought me here.
🖤
favorite sleep token song.. and thats saying something
Esta banda alternativa es ARTE puro ❤
I've had this song stuck in my head since it's came out
Why does UMG block this song from being played in Discord? Universal is a stain on the industry.
❤ Amazing ❤️
The bit starting at 2:47 literally melts my soul every time I hear it.
There is so much depth to these guys and their songwriting. Cannot wait for their album
MY GOD, Everyone of these songs is an absolute banger! I cant to hear the whole album.
Jazz club…..nice
Trash,    rag n bone man fake singing.    Theres a few people I'm friends with that like ST. but I will stand my ground and say this is friggin terrible.
This is the most beautiful song I’ve ever heard please play this at your Brisbane show🥹
It's the reference to alarm bells from dark signs?
So confused with this band...
Sleep elegance.....
The piano has final fantasy vibes. This is straight fire
Waiting for Rick Beato's input on this band.
I'm not the first who wanted to say that but I love that band. The bluesy vibe is great, and I can hear some metal instrumental, in this track it is used that softly...kinda jazz feeling and the piano....awesome👌 And that deeep vocals IT makes me wanna sing IT any place👏
Sleep token really out here dropping bangers like it's nothing! My reaction to listening to this song for the first time is live on my channel if you want to check it out! 🤘
Sleep token brought me out of my depression and I'm back to playing guitar and writing music again❤️
damn is this amazing
Why did this song make me cry
This is my favourite track from the new releases so far….that chorus chord progression has me hooked….There is something about this that rings of pure class…
Best of the singles so far laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawdddd the implements of piano and jazz just hit different on this one
🖤🖤🖤 I absolutely love the music in this one. 🖤🖤🖤 gorgeous video as well
This song is really helping me get over my break up. Thank you gents.
What is the use of aqua regia? It is commonly used to remove noble metals such as gold, platinum and palladium from substrates, particularly in microfabrications and microelectronics labs. Glassware may also be washed with aqua regia to remove organic compounds only in trace amounts.   These guys. These musicians. These lyrics. These vibes.   Worship 🙏🏻
Does anyone else appreciate how the second half of the chorus references the same two-five-one chord progression (relative to the sixth degree major chord of the main key) as what is casually dropped just once in the second verse of ”The Love You Want”, on the lyrics ”make you bleed internally someday”?
least modern hornypost on main
This band will have the entire world mixed up on what genre they claim to favor.  If Sleep Token doesn't eradicate genre period.
I'm glad to see this song is trending on YouTube. Sleep Token's softer songs could crossover in the mainstream, which would bring in fans who normally wouldn't listen to metal.
This is gonna be their year 😍
I didn't know porn was allowed on YouTube.
1 million monthly listeners on Spotify! Just the start of the year and the world’s already within their grasp!
“OK guys I hope you like the intro” The intro:
I so badly want them to blow up this year. No one makes me feel the way sleep token does and I’m sure it’s the same for anyone who listens to them. I love them being this little slice of Eden not many of us get to share but they deserve to be known widely, throughout.
This place will become your tomb was great. Definitely had my favorites but so far every single one of these singles has been a masterpiece. They have reached a genuine level. So unique and beautiful.
This is a sexy song, is the perfect way to describe it. Worship!
i love it
Hard to decide but this might be my favorite single from the album. That piano does things to me, oh lord
This sucks
Woooow...I love how jazzy this song is! Sleep Token keep adding more styles to their style :)
Why do i feel like i need to touch myself??
I’m ready for the sleep token RPG now. These bosses look sick
When this album drops I hope they do a pressed vinyl cause after 10 years of not buying cds or newer artists vinyl I will blow all my money for them and worship.❤
This really is my favourite Pepsi commercial of all the Pepsi commercials
Who designed the creatures and single artworks?
man, i love that jazzy opening. Their songs are always so dynamic, so much variation to the music. I LOVE it
🎶🎶❤️
this shit just grooves....
I can't stop listening to this song!
I'm pretty sure the song is about jacking off.
I thought aqua regia was a chemical but now its something amazing
W O R S H I P
Walking into the water temple in the new Zelda be like
I like how they drop a new Souls boss with every song.
♥️♥️♥️
Yes.   Just yes.
Awesome!!!
Usually not as crazy about their slower songs, but this is insanely good. That piano is flawless. #Worship
Amazingly beautiful as always my friends…
This music makes me feel so relaxed and inspired
Worship
Vessel could drop a solo album of dark pop/r&b and I’d be all over it.
Ok Dark Signs and Descending are my favorite songs but this just won me over.... its insane! Yall are 4 for 4! Every single is better than each other! You never disappoint. So thankful to live in the time of Sleep Token! 🙏🔥
Every new song has something different every time, this one for example gave me a huge jazz piano vibe! I can wait for this album!
Grateful for their powerful integration of piano/keyboard into modern metal. I wish more bands had keyboardists. Worship.
Sleep Token is out here unveiling new characters like they are about to drop a new Mortal Kombat
Does anyone know what vessel is wearing on his back lately live he seems too be changing a bit
This band does not miss, holy fuck.
Another artist that sings in cursive. gross. I don't really get the hype about this band. Sounds like a pop band trying to be edgy.
Can't believe I discovered this song the day it came out. Maybe it's meant to be!
I honestly think I have found my new favorite Sleep Token track, that is until the next batch comes out in 2 weeks. 4/4 for slappers on the album so far! WORSHIP!
Sad I just recently found them
Not my favorite song by them. But it's still not bad.
Don’t know how I got here but this is good
Sleep Token is single handedly responsible for the "Blegh" generation that will be born in 2024 😳
These new tracks have been cycles into the overall playlist while working for the past week. It just flows perfectly for getting in the mindset.
Leo Faulkner
Damnn sleep token trending 🛐 🔥
I vote we give sleep token their own new genre called Sleep Metal
Wow. Are they just releasing their entire album on youtube? Did it leak or something like the fallout boy album from a few years back?
Pretty lit 🔥 algorithm have reasonable taste is refreshing when the world lets you down. A.I. as a friend who offers a song.
This song penetrated me and now im pregnant. Sleep Token better pay that child support.
Vessel I need the whole shabang I need some hard hard just rip my ear off stuff this time
This band really is just the best of all worlds.....every song is an experience. Those not listening are missin out on something special man
4h4 🖤
well, that was refreshing to listen to
I love how they can go from this to Gods.  Skillfull that MF Sleep
Thank you for your music Sleep Token!
How does every song seem to be better than the last in some way?!? Absolutely cannot wait to hear this masterpiece of an album
People don’t know what aqua regia really is…..
Such a diverse album......🤘
Worship
Love the details. Aqua Regia is Latin term for mixture of acids that can dissolve gold and here, in this visualizer, we get some resemblance to molten, flowing gold. Love it. And the song is whole vibe, it’s stuck in my head, I can’t escape.
MOOOAAAAARRRRR /,,/.
<3
Fuggin oof buddy, all the clout coming your way. You deserve it. The vast and diverse change your music has is insane! I've been a musician for majority of my life and this. This is what I want to be apart of! I'm excited to see what's next!
Been hooked since Sundowning. TNDNBTG holds a special place in my heart. Many memories, good and bad, are forever locked within that song. Congrats on all your recent exposure with the new music, Sleep Token. I’ll see you on the road soon!
Omggggggg that pitch
This reminds me cinema by skrillex…but jazzy
overrated af
My only issue with this song is that it's not long enough for me to reasonably sob uncontrollably from how amazing it is
Ranni, is that you?   Elden Ring DLC confirmed.
Side note, does anyone else hear old final fantasy in the piano melody? Im so happy with all this. Worship
"Aqua Regia"  My love is an animal call Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls Between teeth on a broken jaw Following a bloodtrail, frothing at the maw These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford The perfect start to a perfect war Putting down the roses picking up the sword  Aqua Regia Aqua Regia  My past is a holy book A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook Between the pain and the way you look I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook These days I'm a picture frame Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain Out of Eden's vices running through my veins  Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of  When I am done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing And I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging  Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of
Im starting to think this album is a love letter to the movie weird science with Kelly Lebrock. They summon a love interest by using organic and inorganic material descriptions, and now this, aqua regia, an acidic compound used for dissolving metals like gold, used a lot in reclaiming electronics....   Either way, im fucking here for it. Worship
It’s honestly a little silly to be this good
Turns out, this is all just a promo for the new Hideo Kojima game.
Would you please stop putting out bangers almost every day? Thank you! ^^
Loved this from start to finish.
que belleza de tema diooos ese pianito me derrite la pineal <3
I have not been this excited for new releases in so many years. So happy Sleep Token is getting the recognition they’ve always deserved!
Not me refreshing the page all day waiting for another single to drop.
worship
The way he sings "maw" is everything.  How do you put so much into a one-syllable word?!?
What even is a genre at this point. Keep killing it my dudes.
Another song to put on repeat for weeks. Thank you
Those chords were delicious.  Loving the mix of genres, creative AF.  This album is destined to be an award winner.
I love all the random music drops amazing
I love how they take the idea of "genres" and throw it in the trash..sooo good sooo refreshing
I've not ever heard a song I didn't enjoy from you guys! Happy to see you getting the attention you deserve! This album is going to be so amazing! Glad i'm here for it!
Damn, Sleep Token is so versatile. I can already see this as a smooth jazz song.
Music is lit, but Ranni is looking different 🤔
2023 has started off on an amazing note. I’m so fucking excited for this album
This band doesn't miss.
WTF's with all the pops and clicks, thought my speakers where broken
Wow.
Everybody: What genre is it going to be this time?  Sleep Token: Yes
Finding this band was honestly the best thing of this year 😎😎
I'm down bad for vessels voice.
This song is just pure bliss
I didn't see this mentioned in the comments: but Aqua Regia is Latin for 'Royal Water', it's actually an acid solution that can dissolve gold. And I think that plays wonderfully to the artistic concept they've shown in the video, along with how absolutely smooth this song is.
Thank you staying true to your formula and not making every song heavier for mainstream metal simpletons.
Just dropping the jams !! I’m in love .
Looks like a Jawa or a Watcher in the Dark from 40k
wait another!?
Umm that was dull af. Not for me but good luck to em
BOYS PLEASE I can't handle all these releases at once!!! You're too goood! 😭 Worship x10000
Man this album is gonna be fire❤‍🔥
The bangers just keep rolling out!
That piano is so jazzy/sexy!
saham Aqua 📈
Am I the only one, that doesn't get the hype about this band? Dont get me wrong, those guys are talented but as far as to how those songs are structured, Im not as impressed as most other listeners. (Sorry, if my english is not that great gramaticly)
Estou aqui por causa do Felps, e mano pqp música boa demaiiiss, muito foda. O piano estilo Jazz.🛐🛐
me arde el pezon con Sleep Token
God damn
I have never been so jealous of someone's voice in my life
Why does this remind me of Final Fantasy so much?
Literally never listened to this band before..hit me with the best tracks to check out ✌🤘🖤
this goes right to my "don't panic, listen to this" playlist
If they're gonna keep releasing multiple singles a wk, I may just wait from now on. I wanna experience this masterpiece at one time
Oh yes
WOOOWWW THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL WTF
So who's the Sandman Slim fan?
WOW. 🥹🤤👍👍👍♥️
This is such a wonderful, chil vibe
Why does this absolutely sound like something EDEN would put out?
Amazing. I'm a brand new fan, and I'm in for the long haul, this song is a god damn earworm.
I thought it was gonna climax 😢
I've just recently discovered this band, I love how they're experimenting with rock and metal
this album on vinyl when
🙌🙌🙌🙌
Getting a very Noir vide from this long, and I dig it.
Very good Aqua. The Aqua of the Law.
I just found out about Sleep Token and god damn do they sound good. I’m so happy I saw them recommend to me on my channel
This is my oxygen, my safe place, my blood, my spiritual food
Damn i've always loved when they put chem shit in their song, but this is on another level. Worship
Fourth boss and song for soundtrack... the Game please! :D
Lindo
This is unbelievable. Worship.
they just keep dropping 😭😂🔥
they keep releasing new bangers holy fuck
Besides the really awesome music, anyone else interested in seeing all these monster designs get used in other media? I hope they are not just arbitrary?
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. What a bore-fest. Go buy the new Katatonia album.
AOTY and it's still Jan
I am really curious as to what the meaning of the statues is
I'm no musician, just a mediocre acoustic guitarist. But the chord progression on this music is beyond amazing.
Have me feeling some type of way, again
sleep dragons((((
Just realized that all these characters of these visual videos are Tokens and they're not moving, they're like Sleeping 🤯
I could see myself driving down a lonely road at night blasting this. It’s got such a lonely sweetness to it and i love that
The concept art of this project is amazing and your music is always so impressive, new and variable. I'm such a big fan from the beginning, and I can't wait for this album to be available everywhere. Thank you for these masterpieces. Love from France
They can do it all WORSHIP
Arguably the best band in the world right now. Everything they do is absolutely incredible.
man i love that jazz progression in there. so so good.
OMG 😮 I almost cried watching that - absolutely amazing 👏
this song gets me hot
I knew these guys were destined for greatness. We are entering the new era of music.
You guys are going to owe a lot of Child Support for all the baby making that's going on right now...
That jazz piano though, truly grateful I found this band, sleep token the genre spanners, WORSHIP
Saw this live last night in Manchester. Got home at and saw this video had been released only an hour or so after they played it. So cool
man this is amazing!
Chockehold was good, The summoning MASTERPIECE, the last single and this one... Just meh... Sounds too pop for me is not my cup of tea.
The sound is just super groovy
The opening minute of this gave me literal goosebumps. This Album is going to be massive
Saw you guys 2 weeks ago in munich. We all just stood there with our jaws on the ground for the whole set. Can't wait for the album!
THESE GUYS NEVER DISAPPOINT!! And they released now four songs in short period of time, never saw that from a band before, seriously! 😳 I'm not complaining... I love SL's songs! The visuals are one of the best I've ever seen! Have a nice weekend y'all! 🔥
where have all these new fans come from? its awesome to see but this growth is no where near organic.
The only reason they're not dropping a single EVERY day is because they're rendering these masterpieces
I actually love that this didn't go heavy (and I do love when they go heavy). This just didn't need it. The jazz influence is perfect 🤌
such a hooky chorus, damn.
The Piano gets me
Okay vessel, please just rest wtf this is good
Sleep f***** Token! 🤯
So awesome hearing this for the first time live last night in Manchester!
I think Sleep Token headline Download Festival within the next 10 years and are playing arenas in the next 2-5 years (certainly over here in the UK). They were bloody brilliant in Brum on Tuesday night.
Bring back the heavy !!
Its only beginning of the year and Sleep Token already won AOTY. Damn..
They just don't miss
Just dropping bangers all week huh?!! Keep it comin
I love this band it's wonderful and this album is a masterpiece
Unless Silent Planet comes out the door SWINGING this year, I have a feeling that this is gonna be my album of the year based on these 4 singles... Sheeeeesh Sleep Token!
This song is a banger!! That is all!!
Sounds like he tries to sing with a bit of gum balanced on his tongue.
In 2023, we’re at the point where nothing can really surprise you in music anymore, especially rock/metal. Every genre has been mixed in, every twist and turn has been explored, every breakdown, melody, emotion has been covered… with that said this band still surprises me every time they release a song. You have no idea what to expect. This song is beautiful, and has so many layers. I found out about this band pretty late, but I’m so glad I did, they’ve definitely been my favorite since I first randomly heard “fall for me”
Super chill listen, really enjoyed that :D
Their R&B vibes intrigues me 👌🏾
love the biomedical references in the lyrics. worship
Missing the heavy part?
Come to the states please ❤️
Bruh bruh 🔥
Not  a massive fan as I'm a metalhead but not bad, it's definitely a song for radio which will hopefully get them some attention.
Sleep Token just dont miss.
So excited for the album! 🔥
God, I love the Jazz vibes in this track.
Something tells me Vessel was a Chemistry graduate.
"Screaming at the sunshine - Singing in the rain." Gotta love it.
Instant goosebumps
I just hope we get some heavier stuff.... we've been getting progressively less heavy with each album now
Sleep Token goes smooth jazz, I didn't know I needed this
I'm so ready for this album boys!
Acid?
All the new songs have Jazzy and RnB elements and I'M SO DOWN FOR IT LORD HELP ME
I honestly cannot think that there would be anyone not liking their music?? I mean, I tried a few times to convince friends and colleagues and they are not so moved?? 🤯 literally sick singles. All of them. I like the Summoning for what it is, Chokehold is the classic Sleep Token flavour nothing surprising but an absolute banger but Granite and Aqua Regia… ouff. They are a little bit particular and new in that style coming from Sleep Token. But I absolutely love the Instrumentals and Vessel‘s voice just cracks them like they are soft boiled eggs, releasing all the goodness inside further.
Dis sum baby makin music 🔥🔥
AOTY - JAN 2023 already called it
The lyrics in this album deserve their own acclaim. Amazing.
This was so good live!
The most amazing part about this band is they released something as heavy as The Summoning just a couple of weeks ago and then this today, which sounds completely different but they’re both incredible in their own right. Not many artists these days that can pull this off so well.
Man, the new 4 tracks are my first acquaintance with Sleep Token and boy am I so happy I stumbled upon them. This piano progression is immaculate!
talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before
hey guys at 3:20 do you guys hear anyone shouting 'hey' because I don't hear it lol but my friend can hear it
I reckon the new album will drop on the 18th March...that's national sleep day in the UK! Adore these guys, been a big fan for years, and this album is going to be insane. Also the word Eden is a clue to the title of the album 😜
Worship
Sleep Token using the Windows error sound at 1:23 - I'd be mad but it slaps...
1:23 is that the windows background notification sound 😂
Sleep Token is the balm, my itchy soul didn't know it needed.
I  like  such heavy music, but this is so damn sexy that i can't stop listening ... they got a new fan for sure
Wtf I just recovered from granite
Holy fuck this is actually gonna be their best album and also album of the year probably
People need to relax on here. Decent band  but I can hear 70% of their sound on the daily pop station
❤ once again brilliant 🤌🏻
Would love a limited run vinyl of this album. Can't wait until it drops.
Sleep Token 4ever on 🔁❤️✨🤌🏻
Sleep Token: Tricking metal heads everywhere into listening to jazz, electro pop music.  Also Sleep Token: Tricking pop and electro fans into listening to prog metal music.
So is this album going to be more radio friendly I wonder... lot of marketing and then mainstream 🤔 Sick either way... great song in a hipster cafe 😎
cant wait to buy a cd so i can take late night drives to this album
Every release feels like Christmas and Birthday combined <3
Poor guy's just trying to reach Lothric :(
This is so great!
I think someone loves Bloodborne 👀 Mergo’s wet nurse vibes with the art 🖤
That piano part, got me descending
It's annoying me way more than it should that your videos for these new songs aren't available in 4k
Man you guys are killing it, banger after banger. This album is going to be next level
Your music is just a masterpiece! Saw you at the architects concert in Hamburg and wished you would have played more songs !When you played Love you want I cried a little because your songs are so emotional and wonderful.... PLEASE GIVE A CONCERT IN GERMANY WE LOVE YOU 😍😍
This is my fav song so far along with chokehold
ST will have a lot of merch to sell I see
Need this on vinyl NOW
You gotta be kidding?! Another banger already?!? 😍
Funk Token exists and I'm here for it
I'm so happy this band is getting recognized the way they deserve. I've been listening to them for about a year and they were so unknown back then, and now everyone is talking about Sleep Token and I love it!
Really hoping for more heavy songs like gods after they dropped the summoning on us
Dang they releasing song left and right
Wow another one. Need to buy the album
Please come back to Portland had a great time seeing you live.
Fun fact! Aqua Regia is also known as Royal Water, or "Kingswater" in some languages and was named so for it's ability to dissolve gold and platinum. It's a mix of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid and is mainly used today to "produce chloroauric acid" which is used to refine the highest purity of gold. There's also a whole process in what happens when gold is dissolved in it, but I'm not a chemist so I don't fully understand it lol
Anything sleep token I just hit like..
There's not a song of yours I haven't heard, thank you for blessing my ears King. 👑
I'm so glad this exists. The piano here is tasty!
Stop spoiling us! 🙌😄
Oooooh a little bit of Gran Turismo Piano lol❤ gotta love this jazzy infusion from Sleep Token
Just wanted to say, that those animations are awesome as well!
Went to see them last night for the first time and they were awesome better than I expected, can't wait to see them again, favourite band at the moment
Royal Water
All four of these new songs are phenomenal im blown away by these guys
I got a stiffy
Jamiroquai-core is dope
What a nice year to live, every week some nice masterpieces from Sleep Token.
As soon as the vocals kick in the song is ruined
Sooo good song
Song: Masterpiece! Album: upcoming Masterpiece!
Another Masteriece
Okay now I feel like these guys are classmates in Chemistry major
DIOSSSSSS, NUNCA ME DECEPCIONAN🖤🖤
The auto-tune ruins this, and it's tragic.
🔥🔥🔥
Album time soon baby letsssss gooooo🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Woah..... This is dope.
Dude... wth is going on here with Sleep Token. Bangers keep rainin'.
Charles Cornell will talk about this ! Btw it sounds like a jazz pianist remixed a metalcore track :D with all the positive aspects of it
I love this band so much. Each song and album they drop just does not disappoint. Sleep Token deserves the world. Worship.
Y o. it was magnificient WTF. If only pop sounded lile this
Aqua, Regia, Oxytocin runnin in the ether  WHAT A FUCKING LINE
They really treating today like DJ Khaled, because here's ANOTHA ONE
A year of worship it seems
I'm so ready for this album!!
I’ll post this on each new video:  If you don’t release each of these characters as a chess set on album release, I’m gonna be proper disappointed! 😅
U mfs don't sleep, huh?
Pretty meh
I LOVE IT SLEEP TOKEN  IS AMAZING  ❤️‍🔥
My favorite of the 4 so far 💙
Watch them drop the album without any song they've dropped so far🫣
From 218k to 953k monthly Spotify listeners in 2 weeks! Any more questions? It's finally going to be the year of Sleep Token. So damn deserved. It's god damn time!
so good
I’m happy you’re getting so much recognition online right now 🥹 new favorite band.
this gave me pompeii love story vibes.
WORSHIP
bro they cant be dropping singles this quick just drop the album already
For me it’s  1. The summoning  2. Aqua Regia  3. Chokehold 4. Granite
Oooo, kinda jazzy with those chord progressions and intonations. I love it!
Liked this one better than granite, just give us the album already or at least a release date
Been listening to yall since the beginning,  and yall keep blowing my mind.  Let's go!!!!
2023 is your year. Well deserved.
god this song is gorgeous
De funk a jazz que más generos tocaran .Worship!
Too George Ezra like for my taste. Liked the more proggy sound from last album.
🇧🇷🇧🇷❤❤❤
Im sure I’m in the minority when I say this is my favorite release of the four so far..
nunca erraram
Guys are deadset going to put me 6 feet deep, my body can't handle this

i go to work come back and theres already a hot new sleep token single i missed
Loving the visuals on the latest songs👌
Worship.
Imagine if they did deathcore and mix it with country it would still sound good
This band, this man, the lyrics, the way he enunciates words, production, absolutely everything about this band is amazing. In love 😍🔥🔥
Worship
You could have a try not to groove challenge for 2023 with just this song and it would have 100% fail rate...
Just in time, when a got bad. This pulled me up. Thank you.
how does this band keep releasing absolute bangers??? album of the year incoming
What. The. Fuck.
amazing
Every song is a surprise in the best way so far. We're truly in a special time for metal.
yeah this is getting looped for a few hours, god damn, we just keep winning
This is one of their smoothest tracks to date. Absolute delight on the ears ❤ Worship
Worship!
Piano chords reminds me a bit of Jamiroquai. That solo is SO GOOD.
I mean.......wow.
Another sexy banger🥵🔥
SO FUCKING GOOD! ❤️  PLEASE LET US WORSHIP AT RED ROCKS!   Would be a sold out show that I would make the drive from South Dakota to Colorado for!   THINK ABOUT IT SLEEP TOKEN!
Unbelievable. Whats going on here. Band of the year 2023 for sure😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Absolute goosebumps with this band, every time. 🙌 this music is like balm to my exhausted soul.
... 😳🖤
Was expecting something awesome, instead i got something beautiful ❤️❤️
I don't normally get this excited about music but dang this band is killing it song after song.  I am pleasantly surprised keep the music rolling this stuff is amazing.
What a 10/10 song, band, vibe... everything! No sé si estoy listo para que traerá esta banda pero estoy emocionado!
I'm head over heels for this band
All i can say is worship....
I love it, it’s giving me the closing to an anime for some reason. Me listening to it with my migraine mask on. Did I mention that I love it cause I do.
Metal-ish artic monkeys
Damn when you think they can't get more groovy
Nice jazz melodies…
It makes sense why Sleep Token chose to remain anonymous and focus on the music. It's incredible!
My trypophobia: EEEEEEEEEEJJ!
1:23 Man, Sleep Token is so novel with their instrument choices, they even got the Windows Notification noise in here
The sons of bitches did it again.
Definitely one of the best mixed genre bands out there.....usually that doesn't work.
I hope they release statues of each of these characters in these videos. 🤩
not a huge fan of the vocal style, but my dad loves that style. i want him to get into heavier stuff. he doesn't fuck with metal but i think this could be his introductory to heavier stuff as the other singles are a bit nutty. he lives the revisionists (revivalists?)
Why do people keep saying Album of the year? It's not possible to win anything in January. Some band will drop something in June or July and take all the steam.  Architect's should of won with their Album two Albums ago but they dropped it in February.  Buy the Time November came around most people forgot
Jazz Token
This is better than good, if I had a dollar for every bad song these guys put out I’d be in the streets by now
We have been blessed by the gods! Two song in a row!
A new album one song at a time? Game changer! 🤘
93K Subscribers is gonna turn to 9 million pretty soon
banger ❤
bukan main ini band gua liat2 ajg bagus semua
beyond astonishing
Wow. I may like this one even better than The Summoning.
When the grand piano struck that first minor chord and it went dark 😩
This album is shaping up to be fantastic! Im so hyped to hear literally anything that the band puts out.
Not really feeling this one honestly.
Dude, I just started re-playing granite over and over
In loveeeeeeee
This dude’s like a musical alchemist.
Worship
As a prog metal head, I can't believe how much I enjoy the sexiness of this shit. So well executed it's got me getting into more genres. Big respect, merch will be bought.
HERE IN THE FIRST 3 HOURS!! I LOVE SLEEP TOKEN SO MUCH 😭 WORSHIP
This band just doesn't miss.
Band of the year
Rhyming "broken jaw" with "frothing at the maw" is NOT the kind lyrical prowess you often see in the genre they chose to dip into with this song.
man...
Loving the band’s progression on this album.
I'm here for the MUSIC
worship caralhooo
<3
Sleep Token blesses my 2023
Did extraweg make the graphics for this?
Jesus Christ, Why y'all spoiling us like this?! What did we do to deserve this majesty? WORSHIP.
Everything sleeptoken makes is a banger if it isn't incredible it's atleast great and never just good
I...I don't know how to describe it. This song is like  Charlie Brown/mellow elevator/mall music to the classiest level. Vessel's voice is so soulful yet haunting. Gah! This band is so dang good!
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR MORE PIANO. Just beautiful, guys. 90% of what I listen to is death metal, but you've been one of my two favorite bands (the other is Inferi) since This Place Will Become Your Tomb. I cannot wait to hear what you've got for us this time.
Holy shit the keys.... Unreal. Again.  W O R S H I P
Some beautiful chord progressions here. Great tide!
Holy shit they just don't stop surprising me... I've discovered this band by accident for like 2 weeks, and what a happy accident.  It's been a while since i've felt this type of joy knowing a new band.
Not only is the music great, the visuals are deluxe tier. Loving both the 2D and 3D versions of each song's characters
Worship...
Vessel is definitely a Chemistry major.
every song feels like a space trip fuck i love it
What a great feel. Classy progressions. Sleep Token can own any genre they explore, Vessel ties it all together with such beautiful melodies.
I love you guys so much! 🖤🙏🏼🙏🏼  Thank you!  Worship
Is this imagine dragons?
Here we go again, again
What is happening... I am too happy... Yes metal scene is sexy again
my biggest regret is not seeing them live with nothing more in ny, this album is amazing at ever second!
I love this drop schedule we have going on right now, it's like a little gift every day
Headlining American tour, I’m manifesting that shit let’s gooooooo
Sleep Token fans know not poverty, we're always eating well
Can we all just take a moment to recognize how FREAKING AMAZING the lyric writing is????
Sleep token + clown core = same thing .....right? 🤷‍♂️ 🤘
It's not bad but is lacking the genuine vocals and lyrics they've hit on almost every other track. Maybe The Summoning was just too good to follow.
This is too sexy!
again guys right before i go to bed....I HAVE TO SLEEP
Just release the album already we all need it
It’s a damn shame I didn’t hear of Sleep Token before The Summoning. This single is groovy. Hell yeah.
the fact that they just be taking over every genre is fantastic
They just don't disappoint.
Silicon Ballrooms; Subatomic interactions if it’s all good 👨🏽‍🍳💋
Splendid
He's singing like there's something in his mouth
This song is DISTGUSTING. Giving me some real Bayonetta music vibes.
I don’t need to hear more for this to already be AOTY for me.
aquafina lmaoooooo
With each new release I find myself loving this band more and more. You guys are special
I’m surprised these music videos don’t have loading screens between each scene.
Bro this album is gonna fucking tear my ass up, Can't wait.
Where is the drummer... GIVE ME THE DRUMMER. Worship
This song is beautiful and sublime omg
I be fucksin wit sleep token. Hella vibe
Sub count is blowing up.
Literally a dream come true
It’s got this R&B vibe to it. “Soul Metal” shits dope keep goin guys
I want a drum solo from my favorite drummer!
Glad im on the toilet right now because obvious reasons
A lot of babies are going to be made with these new Singles! Sex Metal! #Worship #makihgmetalsexyagain
Lol yeah, I listen to that on the way home today.
🙂
Worship
Worship
these guys have already put every song from 2022 to shame. Sorry Bad Omens, Sleep Token is steeling your spot light quick
WE GATHER IN WORSHIP
His voice is fucking epic
damn beautiful
The summoning was the only good release so far
Sleep Token know how to get you to hit the Loop Video: On
God they just keep getting better
So freakin smooth
WORSHIP
Another freaking banger!!!!
Here we go again.   Again.          ❤️From Kentucky
These songs are alright but none hit the way The Summoning did, that one is just 🤯🤯🤯
Worship ❤
Hozier or George Ezra got a band
this band has stayed my favorite throughout all 4 of my High School years since The Night Does Not Belong To God came out and I don't see that changing anytime soon. genuinely crazy for me to think about
Pianinho cantou. Esperando o Felps reagir.
I have been reassembled.
I swear Sleep Token never stops surprising me. They are truly a masterpiece.
Sounds like Brazilian song. Looks like bossa nova sometimes, for me
Lets gooo sleep token keep making absolute fire
Is “sexy-core” a thing yet? If not, it definitely will be after this album gets released 🤣👍 these singles are GREAT.
Worship!
❤️They’re Back
So much love for your evolution into transcendence Sleep Token!  WORSHIP!!
That piano reminds me so much of another song it’s driving me nuts that I can’t think of it. Tori Amos maybe? Either way this album is going to be phenomenal. Their ability to switch genres but make it all cohesive is insane.
masterpiece after masterpiece; you guys really don't miss. I'm gonna cry when I hear this album front to back
These guys have found a couple hundred thousand followers on Spotify since The Summoning dropped insane.
Omfg I love this band
What’s with all the hype?  These guys are fine, but just another average band with some sort of gimmick to do their publicity. 🤷🏻‍♂️.
I mean it's not bad but I don't get the interest,is it because they wear masks
Sleep token is blowing up this year 💯
Quickest I've ever hit a YouTube notification
Every New song has got a picture about a Boss from FromSoftware 😂😂💜
It’s hot in here.
Damn you are keeping on my toes with these releases 😆
The other day someone asked me “what genre is sleep token?” And I was like “‘no genre their SLEEP TOKEN.”
Really hearing some deep metaphor with manifesting that of ancient civilizations and the beginnings of our kind. Very very deep as always,
At this point do we even call them the breakout metal band? I don't actually think they have a genre.
Have they announced they are releasing an album? Holy crap I can’t take this anymore lol. This is definitely the weaker of the 4 songs they’ve released so far but it’s still got it’s own unique spin to it
Releasing at after midnight? Go to bed, sleep token ffs!
This album will reshape Metal/Rock
Worship!
I need a piano only offering ASAP. This is jazz porn.
Just discovered these guys listening to the summoning a few days ago. So far I’ve listened to a few songs since then, and enjoyed them. Definitely different than what I normally listen too, but good stuff so far.
love it!
An hour ago! I'm early!
The lyrics from these singles have clearly shown how insatiably horny Vessel is.  All seriousness, this is an immaculate vibe. The new album can’t come soon enough✨
Sleep Token is a whole new genre to me. Loved it
The beginning of the song sounds pretty similar to Katy Perry's E.T. Definitely, this band is taking a wild ride experimenting with different genres.  I still preffer "The Summoning"
God i love this. Really sounds like this band have found their place. Somewhere between gothic black metal, r&b and gospel. Its all of those yet none of them, and it sounds strange until you hear the music. Then its just worship.
Another goddamn masterpiece. Single best band in recent memory for me, vibes, lyrics, sound, and themes. God tier, absolute fucking bangers.🔥🔥🔥
Holy shit holy shit holy shit I love you
Bro these guys are just causally killing it
Every song has been fantastic and unique
It really feels like Sleep Token blew their load early releasing The Summoning as the 2nd single. This song has a couple of high points but it feels like it plateaus really quickly. Granite just sounded like an Imagine Dragons song with a breakdown shoehorned in at the end. Meh.
You guys have definitely made my year! Thank you for all the new releases
One of the best singles. So beautiful with that piano
Absolutely wonderful
All these songs follow the exact same formula.  I don’t get the hype, but I’m happy people are enjoying themselves.
Hmm.. This would have been Prince's favorite metal band..
Here while the views are still under 10,000,000
Sleep Token is gonna go down as one of the most talented group of musicians ever. I can't wait till the album drops so I can listen to the entire thing start to finish. These albums are like emotional journeys through musical ecstacy.
🎉🎉🎉 I’m so excited
And now imagine the name sleep token would be missing on this song and any other metalcore band would have released this. It would be mediocre, at best. Weak song only sold well by the name.
cant believe they are about to break 1 mil monthly on Spotify, I feel like a proud parent.
You have got to be kidding me 😲😲🤯🤯
Ugh <3
I think Sleep Token are from the forth dimension.
Sensual & soothing 🤤 🤤
You’re setting standards no one else can reach. Amazing
Smooth and vibey, and I just loved every single second of it.  Worship.
Babe wake up, new sleep token just dropped
All I can say is it's a privilege to be apart of this new genre  being conceived. Worship. Can't wait for Take me back to Eden.  Best album of the year out already.
I dont know how to feel about all of the new music. Some of it so far sounds like the kind of pop music you hear on a show like love is blind - until the last 50 seconds or so.
Man. I cannot wait for this album.
Piano had me thinking gran turismo lobby
this frickin rips man
New favorite
Okay I’ll repeat the comment I left on “granite”   These lyrics are fucking amazing
Truly ascending to another level.
OH MY GOD
So good, so freakin good
Aqua Regia dissolves gold. Makes that animation at the begining pretty neat
So many subtle nods to various genre's, stylish, elegant and featuring wonderful modal shifts that make you just close your eyes and sway. This is just simply good music.
I was relistening to some of their earlier albums and I seen a comment that hit good. Soul Metal, I think that is a great name for their style.
Such a good track! Sleep Token does it all
We are getting spoiled with singles!
This is…. Royal Water❤ 🤤
You guys are next level. I discovered you a couple weeks ago and have been listening only to you day and night wtf
That piano solo is amazing
This fucking band... This albums sounding amazing. I've only just got into them. So weird but so good. I just hope they are saving some awesome songs for the album and not just blow their load prematurely
That piano part is *chefs kiss*. Soooo jazzy
Yeah this is gonna be their breakout album for sure.
What is happening?? I love it, but like...
How is this so freaking beautiful?! WORSHIP!
They are playing in a league of their own.  unparalleled, unchallenged.  This and Granite my 2 favourites, probably out of their entire catalogue.
Another amazing song released so soon! Omg!
Damn that was fast
Babe, wake up. New Sleep Token just dropped.
These songs make me wanna slow dance with my gal and get down and dirty afterwards
I was not feeling this band until these last few singles started dropping. Hook, line and sinker....you got me.
Sleep Tokens are going to blow up, if they haven't yet! Masterpiece! Worship! 🙏
This new album is going to be an all time great masterpiece.  Their previous albums are incredible and they still managed to find a whole new gear to shift into.  Truly unbelievable.
Keep them coming!!
Hell yeah the new Dark Souls bosses look great.
They just never stop putting out bangers hey
YOU CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
Jeeesus these 7th chords at 1:02 tickling my brain. I adore your melodies so much!!
You actually do not even give me one day to breathe and take in Granite, I CAN'T TAKE THIS YOU GUYS ARE ACTUALLY THE BEST
OMFG the Jazzy chords and overall feeling of the song is killing me! Is there anything Sleep Token can't pull of? Can't wait to hear all of them songs. Worship
I'm getting WHIPLASH
These guys are unreal. Absolutely cannot wait for the album to drop.
🤘🖤🙏🔥🙌 Sleep Token is finally blowing up💥! You can't go wrong listening to anything you release. Much respect for what you do. 🎧
*chef's kiss*
#Louisiana here, I’m beyond grateful to have come across your music! It’s truly special to have the gift this band has. Keep at it Sleep Token🔥
This band's musical scope is astounding. So much variety between tracks, and all of them complete fucking bangers. Worship!
Super catchy
RB progressive metal love song? Sure, why not!
ANOTHER SONG?!? ALREADY??? WORSHIP
calling it: album of the year... probably for the next decade
I'm sure vessel was a frustrated scientist at some point in his life. The lyrics to this are Art
Os cara não para 🔥🔥🔥
They. Cannot. Miss. Let the ritual commence.
Each track seems to be such a great intro for those who don’t normally like metal. Gonna bring so many new people into the fold with this album, genius.
And BOOM another banger!!!! Sleep token NEVER disappoints 🙌🏻
WORSHIP 🔥🔥🔥
That's not pee it's squart.
Haja coração! ❤️
Aqua Regia- a mixture of concentrated nitric and hydrochloric acids. It is a highly corrosive liquid that will dissolve gold and other resistant substances
1:24 spam for windows sound.
These guys are on a roll
Such a chill and relaxing song, love it!
This album is going to be perfection. Worship.💙
This is my new favorite band  I'm curious about all these figures in these videos too
Im here for all of this. Sleeeeeep
i need the feeling of hearing the summoning for the first time again
i mean they just keep dropping bro, i’m not complaining i love this shit
Idk how to explain it, but this song smells so good
They can not make anything less than magnificent music!
what is happening!?
Im so here for the year of sleep token. <3
everyday upload nice
Jeez I was not ready for how good this is. Definitely going to be on replay.
All the talent was used up on The Summoning apparently
They just keep going 🤯
This is my least favorite from new releases, but it’s also a 9 out of 10. This band is something special!
So many incredible songs already, and the first month of 2023 isn't even over yet. Just give us what we want, give us the album!
worship.
That piano jazz solo is so beautiful
WORSHIP WORSHIP WORSHIP
1:24 Windows sound?
VESSEL IMPREGNATE MY WIFE
See you guys on the first of February
What the fucking fuck?! Scary how hard this shit slaps! I hope Chat GPT didn’t make this…
Worship
almost first
This is incredible.
Loved the first two songs they released, this kinda sounds like something Imagine Dragons would vomit out to be honest
Saw them live in Manchester a few hours ago… best show I have ever seen in my entire life. Wish I knew this one when it was played but still vibed out
“sleep token have another awesome song!”  “yeah i know, i heard it yesterday, it’s sick!”  “no, no… ANOTHER new song”  “!?!?!!!”
put a track like this on the main radios and it breaks the chart easy. that piano, his voice, the groove, lyrics and the top notch production...there's everything.
Been hyping these releases to my friend. He saw them a while ago and this is dropping. Beautiful....  Worship
I'M SO FRIGGIN HAPPY
Another one
was worth staying up late tonight. My most awaited album so far
*gestures at Sleep Token*  She DOES have the range, darling.
Esses menó são rápido pra produzir música cara kkk gloria a Deus 🙌🙌🙌
what the fuck is this  the layers in this song are spetacular
Thank you Sleep Token for all the wonderful music you put out <3
Worship 🙏
2:04 = eargasim 🔥🔥🔥
Essa pegou forte.   EXCULAXOOOOOWWW  👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Essa banda é incrível demais, parece que eu estou ouvindo um gênero novo. Aconteceu a mesma coisa quando eu ouvi Linkin Park pela primeira vez.
WORSHIP!
Os caras estão com tudo gzuisssss 🤩
Im so here for everything this band is doing. Its amazing.
Can’t wait for a U.S. tour with this album. Worship🙏🏼
S E N S A C I O N A L !
When is this NFT collection dropping @Sleep Token
Dude....are you guys trying to kill me with the excitement!!? My heart!!!! I love this band so FREAKING MUCH!! 🖤🖤🖤
This experience. Witnessing these amazing releases. It’s singular. Glad to be here!
The year couldn't start better Worship
Boring
Ya, I like this band, but this an Imagine Dragons song.
Heard this live tonight in Manchester… beautiful band, beautiful gig.
I'm sure Sleep token it's the ''next big thing'' and i'm so happy for it, this guys are filled with talent.  Worship.
THAT PIANO SOLO THO??
Starting off the new year right! I cannot wait for the rest of this album.
Each video has a boss from a Dark Souls type game. Love the art.
De una mis perr0s... está bien chida la rola!!!
Daaaamn Sleep Token are decided to release a fine fire album and I can’t be more prepared
Anotha one
Love the evolution. This isnt even a Metal song, but the band pulls off these poppy synths mixed with these gorgeous vocals. The talent here is impossible to not appreciate.
Masterpiece.
This song is sooo smooth.
Polaris' new album has to be a BANGER to take AOTY from this.
Just watched them play this in Manchester. I've never witnessed a sea of moshers transition into a sexy groove so seamlessly.
They've sealed AOTY in JANUARY 💜
that jazz piano tho
Whoo I beat nik nocturnal
Another one added to the playlist.
"These days I'm a circuit board, integrated hardware you cannot afford." my boy feeling like apple silicon m2 max 😭😭🤧🤧
New music again.. Jesus bless you 🔥❤️🤘🏻🥺
Beautiful...❤
please just inject this whole album into my veins.
Worship
So stoked for the new album!
Aqua Regia. "Royal Water." Named after its ability to destroy precious metals like gold and platinum.
I get the feeling that Vessel may be a chemist, first with alkaline and now with aqua regia, either that or he’s really good at researching for metaphors lol
I don’t even know what to comment anymore. The own my heart and soul.  Worship
We are the first ten thousand lets go!
I won't lie, these last 2 singles just didn't hit the same for me as Chokehold/Summoning did. But I know they're going to grow on me. I just became a fan of the band from Chokehold/Summoning and fell in love with TPWBYT; I know after a couple more listens to these last 2 singles within the context of the album I'll be loving them as much as the rest of their discography, fucking phenomenal band
Just heard of these guys like 10 minutes ago, only to look them up and find they're dropping new shit right now.
Love the new tracks.
¿Would be the album of the year? Absolutely.
Unreal. That's all I can say.
Vessel’s lyrics and his flow and cadence are amazing
2:46 🥺🥀
I want to give these guys more of a chance, but the melodyne vibrato all over the vocals is really offputting.
I get so excited when an artist (music, film, anything) does something really *new*. Sleep Token just keeps giving us that, song after song. I can't wait for more!
Yep  on of those bands that comes around very rarely Stunning !! Amazing songs ,musicianship and production
Those jazzy progressions in the background hit differently. WORSHIP.
This album will make their last one look amateur and that is truly saying a ton. Cannot wait to hear the entire masterpiece.
BROOOOOOO WTH!
Oh hi, we're Sleep Token. We do metal, worship an ancient dark god and drop fire jazz piano trap bangers
I love this band so much! Worship
Where did that keyboard come from??
I’m loving this way of dropping new stuff. Let’s just release one song, then another tomorrow, then in two weeks when our fans think they’ve been listening to it on repeat too much we can start the cycle all over again
If this band not breaks up ,  they will stick to the top charts for years WORSHIP
WHAT IS GOING ON 😂
Certified platinum. I just found you guys. Alkaline slaps. My wife agrees. Love everything about this song. Good shit y'all.
In love
I just refreshed to this blessing
Every first listen of a new Sleep Token song is like having the thrill of not knowing if you're going to get a punch in the face or a passionate kiss before the song is over.  Worship.
Oh my God i've been blessed with 2 songs in 2 days again. Worship!
Sleep has always been quite proficient in chemistry hmm Worship
Boy oh boy! This record is gonna be something!
These 4 songs alone already won album of the year... I'm without words. Worship. 🤘❤️
I honestly think this album might just catapult Sleep Token into so many new ears, me and my gf have been getting so many people from so many different walks of life into this band/cult even before they dropped these past few singles, this particular song has just such a unique tone to it, its got some great jazz/lounge/R&B vibes that I just gotta slam my jam to it.  Easily my favourite so far.
Banger after banger
you guys are just churnin out that love!
these dudes makin me wanna actually worship Sleep fr
Just wow, this culmination of music works is constantly blowing my mind... wow.
Tribe Society vibes on this one, awesome beat.
Well my love is an animal call Cutting through the darkness Bouncing off the walls Between teeth on a broken jaw Following a blood trail Frothing at the maul These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford A perfect start to a perfect war Putting down the roses, picking up the sword Aqua Regia Aqua Regia Well my past is a holy book A call from Olympus ringing off the hook Between the pain and the way you look I'm stuck in a town where the mountains shook These days I'm a picture frame Screaming out the sunshine, singing in the rain Sugar on the blood cells Carbon on the brain All of Edens vices running through my veins Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the Ether Silican ballrooms Sub-atomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of - Interlude - Oh, and I'm done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing And I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the Ether Silican ballrooms Sub-atomic interactions if it's all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of  #WORSHIP
I get done listening to granite for the hundredth time and this comes out and I'm already banging my head again
We already know about the song quality of the songs, but hands of applause for the animator behind these visualizers, because these look amazing
This song Live at Manchester tonight was something absolutely special. One of the greatest nights I've ever had!
Incredibly groovy, did not expect this at all, but I guess I should always expect the unexpected with Sleep Token
the production on this album is out of this world.  It's divine.
Here before a milly
The fact that this band manages to hop between styles so effortlessly is what makes them great for me, they're good at everything they dooo
This band has taken me on the craziest musical roller coaster and I’m here for it
Damn 25 min and already over 300 comments 🤯
This song is a straight up Vibe. Perfect nighttime, windows down, cruisin kinda feel.
A jazzy mix of that classic Sleep Token tone and style. Absolutely perfect! WORSHIP!
they definitely played this one yesterday
Excuse me, but what the fuck. It will be AOTY for me, for sure. And we’re just midway January. It can’t be real, I’m speechless.
Take. My. Money.
You guys have really set the bar high for music this year. Worship.
A great band getting even better.  Beautiful!
These last two singles.. dunno why.. give me Micheal Barr's solo project vibes. That would be one cool feat, you two.. just sain' :)
This track just has such a calming vibe to it! Love it! ❤
ANOTHER ONE ALREADY? So many bangers one after the other. Discovered you guys when you launched Alkaline, being a fan ever since
few things I want to mention.   1. The intro piano reminded me alot of Parasite Eve (video game) intro song.   2. This is alot like a Red Hot Chili Peppers song during the chorus which is awesome.   I'm excited for the new era of Sleep Token
Worship
nice
See ya in London can’t wait
- How beautiful, exciting, magical can they be? - Yes.
It's definitely not a bad song. Whatsoever. But this may be my least favorite of all the newer singles.
eles não param, é uma música melhor que a outra
God I love thissss, so vibey!
This is a fantastic twist. These jazzy piano chords and ride cymbals and these soft dynamics, but still maintaining the Sleep DNA, I was honestly expecting the 8 string to make an appearance, but it was interesting to omit it.
i dont understand how they keep putting out banger after banger
WORSHIP
w o r s h i p
Just gonna like before I listen because with the last three tracks, I know I cant be disappointed.
Oh my wordddd this man's voice....ALBUM WHEN????
you be killing sleep token you are topping my all time fav band tool and they are not a easy act to follow.
Someone said "gonor-rhea" lol
what a gold
I knew, but I didn’t know. Fucking wow. Jesus Christ guys. Wow.
This is fire ❤🔥
I bet they were itching to release such masterpieces. This format of releasing singles is actually genius, the world is talking about them nonstop since the first drop. Worship.
Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow Wow WOw Wow Wow WOW
No chonk, big sad
THIS SONG FUCKS 😍 AQUA....REGIA....WORSHIP
I'm getting spoiled....... don't stop
Holy shit another one?!
How can they mix so many genres, not only in the album, but in the single song, and make it work so well? It's like r&b, hip hop, jazz, prog. Like what
Wow! I have learned not to anticipate what's coming next while still expecting it to be incredible. And it's another brilliant song! Worship!
this is so yummy, and the piano was so smooth!
Wtf my head can’t handle all these new songs at the same time I can’t fucking wait for the album amazing work guys
You guys NEED to come to Brazil, I want sooo much to see this band in live!
This is going to be the album of the year for me. I can feel it. Holy shit. Every song a banger. They never miss.
I wish this song was 6 mins
I'm loving how quickly they are dropping new music! I can't keep up with all these bangers
This album will be the one that catapults them. In 5 years cynical music snobs are going to say this band is bad just because they got popular. Just remember we were fans because of the music.
Boys, slow it down!!! I'm still listening to Granite!!! 💀💀💀
It's Sleep Token 'O'clock everyone!
🔥⭐🌛🤘
These lyrics are nuts. Ties into chokehold, alkaline, dark signs, and probably a lot more. Aqua Regia is a chemical that has the ability to dissolve gold.
The only band I hit the Like button for before hearing the song. They just don't miss at all for me.
Man, what a banger
[Verse 1] My love is animal call Cutting through the darkness, bouncing off the walls Between teeth on a broken jaw Following a bloodtrail, frothing at the maw These days I'm a circuit board Integrated hardware you cannot afford The perfect start to a perfect war Putting down the roses picking up the sword  [Pre-Chorus] Aqua Regia Aqua Regia  [Verse 2] My past is a holy book A call from Olympus, ringing off the hook Between the pain and the way you look I'm stuck in a time where the mountains shook These days I'm a picture frame Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain Out of Eden's vices running through my veins  [Chorus] Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it’s all good Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of  [Interlude]  [Bridge] When I am done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing And I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging  [Chorus] Aqua Regia Oxytocin running in the ether Silicon ballrooms Subatomic interactions if it’s all good  Gold rush, acid flux Saturate me, I can't get enough Cold love, hot blood Running to your heart when you're thinking of
\ (^o^) /
gospel piano got me like 🙌
Banger after banger. Can't wait to get this album and play on repeat
Nice piano section thrown in there 🎹
how many genres are they bending on this record? it’s insane, every track has so much depth         I did not anticipate my comment starting a war in the replies but here we are lol. yes, it’s a pop song. who cares? it’s still crazy good.
Whaaaaaaat?! another one already?! Sleep Token chill! 🔥
If they keep dropping tracks like this I'm gonna run out of clean trousers.
Amazing
ANOTHER ONE? OMG 🤌  this album is about to be amazing. holy shit. i'm excited.
Sleep Token goes jazz? I dig it!
What Elden Ring boss is this?
I absolutely love how the keys are mixed so up front in this one, almost like they're treated like guitars are mixed usually. They're a treat, like the other songs, perfecrly mixed.
"These days I’m a circuit board, integrated hardware you cannot afford"  LIIIINE!
What?! Again!?
This album is going to be incredible.
I was literally just listening to Granite and then this song started playing and I was like "Oooooooooooooh, damn 🤤, what is THIS?" THE NEWEST DROP 🤯  I LITERALLY CANNOT GET ENOUGH
"and I am done fighting off change / no wonder my arms are still swinging"
I miss "Nazareth" Sleep Token.
So unique. So good. Uuuuuuggggh
I’m so jealous of all the new fans that get to listen to Sleep Token’s discography for the first time.
someone's been playing elden ring
Worship
Too soft 😁
I swear if they don't sell these figures I'm gonna scream I want them all on my shelf
I love this collection of semi dark souls characters as song characters
This is shaping up to be their career defining album.
Another already!? Sheeesh!
best fucking album so far
Oh dear god. We’ve met our match. Wow.
Que maravilha, mais musica nova.
Llleeeetttsss gooooooo!
It makes me so glad to watch Sleep Token grow, and to watch others get caught in their orbit like we did. This album is going to kick ass. Worship.
Next Song? Wow 🤘
Dude. Dude. Duuuuuude. How this guys can do a such magic/perfect good music? This is how we WORSHIP. I Love this band so much!
Yess
I just love what these guys are doing with their singles! Two days in a row?! You guys are spoiling us!!
Love the piano in this song. Between new ST album and new Haken, this year is starting out great!
Lead singer sounds like Lewis Capaldi.
W O R S H I P
Just announce the album release date FFS guys your killing me , another killer track , dam that production is crisp.
Another one?! Truly grateful 🖤
Sleep Token is SLEEP TOKEN. Nothing else. They make their own path. 🔥🔥🔥
Slow down with these bangers, I can't keep up.
Guys, you are challenging Metallica.     "Finally...a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary!"
I'm addicted to this one already. This album is already part of me.
How is every song they put out the best song they've ever done? I need answers.
Yall need to chill. Let a brother catch his breath.
Yea dude this is appreciated
🖤
The videos are a visual masterpiece 👌
Out of pain came something beautiful. Thank you to whoever is Vessel’s ex.
Here for the release!
i died at 2:19
The mood, the lyrics, the flow of it. We're being spoiled by these guys.
I was so excited to hear this song when I saw it on the tracklist
My Heart can't take this any more
they just drop  music out of knowhere love it
I KNEW IT!!!!
It’s going to be hard for any other band to top “Take Me Back To Eden” this year with how good these latest songs are 🔥
Everything indicates that this album will be the best of 2023. WORSHIP!!!!!!!!!
god damn, who are you guys, and what have you done with sleep token? you guys just keep switching it up, and I'm totally here for it.
OMFG
at the end i expected some heavy breakdown but i guessed wrong, in all its a beautiful song <3
Gods
Worship.
Worship.
AOTY INCOMING 🛐
I can't wait for Gods to play after this in my shuffle XD
Who else has been waiting all day for 12:00 London time for this 🙌🏻? 🔥 I think Sleep Token and Bad Omens are the two bands In the metalcore scene that you never really know what you are going to get from track to track. They really have no genre…. They’re just Sleep Token, and I love it. That being said, I hope we get some more heavy soon 🙏
The music I needed in 2023!!! 😍😍💙💙💙
You guys are the best you only post fire!
I'm not even done vibing to Granite, dude!
So many genres mixing up weirdly good
Lyrics:  My love is an animal call, cutting through the darkness,  bouncing off the walls. Between teeth on a broken jaw, following a blood trail, frothing at the maw.  These days I'm a circuit board, integrated hardware you cannot afford. A perfect start to a perfect war. Putting down the roses, picking up the sword  Aqua Regia Aqua Regia  My past is a holy book a call from Olympus, ringing off the hook. Between the pain and the way you look, I'm stuck in a town where the mountains shook  These days I'm a picture frame Screaming at the sunshine, singing in the rain. Sugar on the blood cells, carbon on the brain out of Eden's vices running through my veins.  Aqua Regia oxytocin running in the ether silicon ball rooms subatomic interactions if it's all good  gold rush, acid flux saturate me I cant get enough cold love, hot blood running to your heart when you're thinking of  Oh and I am done dancing to alarm bells No wonder my ears are still ringing and I am done fighting off change No wonder my arms are still swinging  Aqua Regia oxytocin running in the ether silicon ball rooms subatomic interactions if it's all good  gold rush, acid flux saturate me I cant get enough cold love, hot blood running to your heart when you're thinking of    Worship <3
Man this is wild. They’re Gonna be huge
Myyyy goddddd this is vibey assss helllllll. Godamn I can not wait for the full album 😍 Im gonna be eating up these 4 singles up for the next couple of months thats for sure haha
We’re not worthyyyy
This is so beautiful, I can't wait to see it live
This is such a TASTY jam. Love to hear Vessel killing it on the piano. WORSHIP
I wanna see all these creatures as dark souls bosses
another day another banger
That snappy groove got me.. 🖤🔥
Jazz fusion feels. Love it honestly been waiting for a song like this from them. I heard a jazz influence with this drummer maybe it was there or not but this sounds amazing and clean
Nice chill song but I’m hoping the new album will have some more heavier stuff than the first two.
"hmm i wonder if they gonna release anything today" refresh youtube and here it is.... nice!
WORSHIP BRASIL É NOIS (de novo)
Worship!
Can people please stop comparing ST to other bands now please?! They have earned their originality time and time again. It's about time that he gets the recognition he deserves. Worship.
hey fam, lovely to see you all here.  ❤️
This is the one band I can confidently say have never put out a bad track
Okay this, for sure, is my new favorite from Sleep Token (until the next single is released, of course). 🖤
Another utter utter masterpiece. Somehow you guys have levelled up from the pre Sundowning EPs, Sundowning and TPWBYT. See you on Saturday in Bristol, I cannot wait to stand in worship.
Sleep Token is always brilliant! Worship!
Wow ANOTHER!!!
my god
Who even has leverage at the label to release music like this? Thats how u know these guys are winning.
Simply amazing. Vessel's voice is like no other. Can't wait for the full album.  Worship
THEY CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Every song is so good... production is next level.  These guys should be a household name. Worship! "Oh and I am done dancing to alarm belllsss...."  CHILLS
see yall in 2 weeks lol
Please please upload in 4K so I can play this in my living room in all of its glory!
I'm so ready for the full album.
Worship
Album of the year 100%  WORSHIP
Been annoyed as hell today. Just life stacking shit like it does, you know? Literally none of that is bothering me now. Everyone knows that music can change the shape of a day, but Sleep Token manages to do that with every masterful song.
This feels like a "Yeah, we've written album of the year and we know it" song.
vai com calma, eu preciso respirar da ultima bomba
Christ alive they goin for a round 2!! WORSHIP
worship.
This album already is a whole new level of Worship
every song is a masterpiece -- just cannot get enough of this band and I've been following them for years
Banger after banger.
WORSHIP
Worship. 🖤

That piano thooooooo. Worship.
WORSHIP.
jazz token
Okay now that the songs over, I gotta say this is my favorite so far from the 4, it's so chill and flows amazingly.
Thanks for making music that’s interesting and different. Right on!
I’m calling it… Album of The Year
Those piano progressions are jazzy AF!

At this point I'm expecting a rap song next.
Worship
Nothing short of amazing

Gonna be a baby boom in October and it'll be Sleep Token's fault.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Let's gooooo! Sleep Token has blessed us with more music
They just keep dropping surprise singles and I’m all about it
WORSHIP 🥰
I can't wait for the new album! ❤️❤️
been refreshing for minutes i tell you, MINUTES. Worship!
SLEEP TOKEN JUST KEEPS DROPPING BANGERS
Okay, so are we just gonna release two songs every week until the album comes out?   Plus, if this is the sound that the rest of the album is going to be, then Sleep Token are doing it the right way (i.e. not showing off the new sound immediately in a way that it alienates the fans, preferring the method of releasing songs that gradually introduce the new sound)  Also, this just may be the pop song Finn Mckenty wanted from them.
Hawt damn this is a special time WORSHIP
I love this band so much
💙💙💙💙💙
Wooooooo!!!!
How quick these guys pump out music is insane to me. We’re getting full albums every 1.5 years
