I wonder about the structural integrity with so many cutouts, especially where you have a window and a door next to each other. I understand the tube steel is supposed to compensate it, but the flex of the corrugation side panels and if the top will sag is a curiosity for me.   Especially with a snow load.
After months I'm binging again.  My favorite utubers.
Starting over? As in moving? What about your current home and the guest container you were just building?
The top of the container is maximum height for the standard trailer chassis. 13’ 6” is maximum over the road height 😂 so it would require a special chassis to lower it down to a legal height for bridge clearance 😎
"Don't wish your life away." The absolute wisest of words.
Not true. I still drop into the parents house and ask them what they are doing! I have a feeling the type of parents you both are your kids will always be interested.
And believe me, kids grow up so fast. You will one day look back and realize just how fast it actually went.
Are they really only 32??
Your son and daughter are so adorable. You're making good progress on the guest cabin. Stay safe.
I had seen ship containers bfre..since childhood but from so far n mayb little near from later n then in tv.

Impressive.
I noticed the intro is different and music is different.  We have watched you for years now and you don’t need to change to what look more professional?  We like you the way you are.   We love you guys.
I think they a very hard working couple a great parents also
Have you seen the foam insulation panels now being made for these trailers??? They can be used inside or outside.
Luv these guys also. Your patience is admirable. Seems like you have a whole lot of rain now.
0:46 I just thought y'all should make that gap at the top of the window rotate 35° open and the bottom  just slides open from the right to the left.   Edit... Too late for that 🤣🤣
I love you guys,been watching from the beginning !!❤
*For a few months now I have been searching tirelessly for information on how to start investing. I even payed $1000 for a course that I now regret. It appears that there is no structured guidiance for beginners on how to get started in this realm. I've come across several investors making well over $250k/annum and would be grateful if anyone on here could provide insights on how to get started, identify potential stocks, when to make an entry, exit etc.*
Great video
Электричество в лесу!!! Супер!
music is over dramatic most of the time.
I was just wondering,..... are you going to put a high pitched roof on the cabin so as to allow for storage? If you are then you might want to put in some stiffeners in the ceiling as well but closer then ten feet apart. More like four feet apart.  Just saying.
You said that he would miss the days when the kids are interested in what he is doing,  it reminded me of a song.  If you are interested, and don't already know it then here is the info..... Trace Atkins, your going to miss this! Check it out on YouTube.  Oh I just want to say, I love and enjoy all of your videos. You guys are great and an enjoyable part of my day when I get to hang out with you. Also if you are planning on doing air b&b, then I would love to have a visit.
So where’s the cabin gonna reside…….🤔🤔🙃
Man how the kids have grow as well as the property…….”KUDOS” guys…..👍👏👍👏👍👏👍👏👍👏👍👏🤣👏👍👏👍👏🤔👏👍👏👍
just write the dimensions you are trying to remember onto the roof with a sharpy......it can be painted over later when you get rdy to put the roof deck on.
"Don't wish your life away." That's gold.
Just ran across your channel.  You guys are an inspiration.  I'm assuming y'all moved to Texas.  If so, welcome! I hope things are going well for you guys.
Mom ... Mom .... what ya doen Daddy 💗💗
Have you ever shared what ya all do for a living?
We look forward to every video y'all put out! Keep up the great work! Y'all are so inspiring! 🤟😎🤟❤️🇨🇱❤️🥳
How much budget
Love them too.
Hi guys  Are you running your welder machine  120v with your generator or 240?
I think it’s time for Spencer to build the kids a jungle gym. A slide, some swings, and some monkey bars.
Kinda wish this next project was building your own in-ground pool
Are you kidding me?  I think your new project is stupid!
Their great
New sub to the channel keep that great content coming.
where do yall purchase the container?
Missing you'll.
The wife is lazy
He's not looking happy lately .time for a break.
BTW even though this is day seven and you may have been told many times... at the 5:40 mark there is a spot where welding was missed. I say this as it seems solid welded seams appear to be part of your waterproofing plan. The window was already primed as if you were done welding but...Daylight!
How come your not posting as often 🥲😘🇬🇧
I love watching you guys y'all  doing an awesome job I've been watching you guys from the beginning. I'm trying to do a weight-loss journey I post some videos on YouTube be awesome if I could have you guys support please and thank you and be safe stay healthy.
I love watching the progress you make and inspires me to possibly make a home out of shipping containers one day. I would like even more to see more content of you enjoying your finished home and with the kids is always a plus.
poor guy does all the work by himself
After your dont with that, another idea is to build a boat house
Take a lot of photos and videos as those two kids will be 25 next week.
You are absolutely right. One day the kids will start leading their own lives and while they still love you they will go on their own journey. It’s a matter of life as God planned. Enjoying the channel. Tks for sharing.
How precious that sweet little voice is..darling children..
They turn into teenagers and they are possessed by demons. They hate you and you still have to house and feed them.
So what about the gaps in the window and door frames.
Gotta ....   SAY.   " ONE DAY"  WE DO THE  Best We Can .
7:35 evil bob ross
What work does Spencer do?  Or is he building this cabin 7 days a week
"What are you doing Daddy?" "Oh I'm just putting on weird hats that look like wigs!"  It is looking real good guys!
Do I need to buy you some safety boots for when your grinding? 😂
I highly doubt that your kids will not care about what you're doing. With your many talents, "What are you doing?" is going to turn into "Can you help me?". 😉
Hey Google images of wedding ring welding injuries 😂
Coming along nicely ❣️Sweet toddler times. Mine are now 39 and 41🙃🤪
My daughters are 18, 19 and 21 and they don't care what I am doing now. I wish I had taken the time to share with them when they where young. Don't miss out on it Spencer!
Love the coat trick for a wig, it made me laugh.
What the name of the song in the beginning
And that's why you make sure your welding gloves are a loose fit.
Is this going to be another 3 year project???
Great seeing you guys again
Words to live by, "Don't wish your life away".
Love your genuine, "non-entertainment" channel.  Your laugh is precious and melts hubs heart every single time 🥰
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Nice work guys. Any plans for the permanent support for the container? Surely the current stacks of stones are temporary...  Happy building, Paul
Happy to see you all on another adventure. We continue to watch and enjoy your family interactions.
How much did this all cost, how much time did it take from start to finish and where do y’all live?
Do you have fish stocks in the pond.. that you fish?
You need to stop bending at the hip. You need a workbench to work at standing height.  I've been watching you doing this for years now and by the time you finish you may look out on all you have achieved with chronic back pain from bad work practice's. Those frames you cut up wod have made perfect steel and wood cutting benches. Love your work.
👍
You might want to consider temporary lateral bracing. Since you will be moving it.
Not enough Kensie in this video!  No offense Spencer, but she is way prettier than you. LOL
Totally thought Spencer said "anal iron" the first time 😂
Your little ones are fantastic. I can only remember when mine were little and they asked a million quesstions. I wish that time would come back. Im now a grandad and a Great Grandad and can only dream. Make the most of it
“Im just painting baby” aw bless her..too cute 🙏
What made you move to Texas?
The comment about your kids killed me haha. Its so true my daughter is now 10 and I am uncool. I went from being the most interesting thing she ever saw to the most boring and weird haha.
Great job! The cabin is coming along nicely.
Do you see any HURRY to complete the container cabin? if not take your time and double check the plans before you  go into a new component of the build, you will thank your  self later.
Spencer need some safety shoes 👟👟
She might care when she get older my oldest is 34 and she call me and say what you doing momma some time it's a trick because she wants something so be careful how fast you answer 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh good!  That’s not the final resting place.
Can’t understand a word you’re saying
Things are really coming along!  Have you considered changing the ending of your videos like having one or both of you thanking viewers for coming along on your journey, etc?  Also, have you considered adding onto your existing home for more living space?
From day one I have watched all your videos much love from Africa Zambia 🇿🇲
Have you ever accidently started a fire while grinding or welding?
Im not a huge fan of using the hand saw while standing over top of it . Not only are the boys exposed but so is the femoral artery . Its not how will a blade explode its when trust me .
So enjoy watching all you both have done  beautiful place work
Why don't you turn a small area of the roof into a roof deck
little kids are so annoying omg
I would like to make a reservation now to rent the cabin when you finish it. Thank you. 🤗
You two are amazing and your two little ones, love watching your video's on u tube.  Now, I have a silly question, could you add another container to your existing house, I mean later on if you wanted to add more room to your home to add more room for family and storage.  My nephew is restoring a container to make for himself a tiny home and I must say it's going to be beautiful too.  I love your pond but not so much snakes, .  Best wishes to you all.  I am from Iowa and it's cold here.
Nice Update! Thank you
I'm wanting to see how you plumbing into the septic  the water plumbing  should be piece  cake
💗
Doing such a wonderful job at building the cabin, editing the videos and raising up your chidren. Wow ! Really amazing, congratulations !
My husband and I always notice how artistic your videos are!  Have been watching now for years!  We love  you guys.
Frame your roof with wood 2x8 and soffits then either steel roofing or shingles then you can run all your duck and electric in the rafters and  all you need to do is have an access panel 24x24 and just cut the steel roof out that size save a lot of headaches insulating also ! You can do it!
After this one you may need a break from building container homes. It would be nice to see you set up your on vegetable and fruit trees garden, and also stock the pond with fish! I really enjoy watching your channel! A great escape from the madness! 😊👌
man Spencer build you a work table from one of those steel shipping  crates that you repurposed for your roof brackets,  i think  it would work perfect and keep you from working on the ground!! keep it up you guys!!!
And ,when you were filming this video,I Also Noticed the Pink sky, where I live. It caught me off guard, seeing it where you are 🤨🤷‍♀️🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
Omg, Mackenzie, Did you See That Pink Sky ? I Live In Orchard Park, 1/2 mile From Buffalo Bills Stadium, Anyway, I Luv You Guy’s 🌹❤🙏🙋‍♀️ Just Wanna Say, keep up the Great Work❤
Wow with nothing more than a shipping container and a massive amount of money thanks rich people for showing me what I’m missing! A plus tossing your child out there too gotta get those likes and it’s never too early to use your children.
See, I Told ya ,Spencer, would figure it out 😊
Yaaaa👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙋‍♀️ Another video, kids are beautiful and getting bigger🎉🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹
clicked on this video just to say you're called life uncontained but you're building a container. someone call the cops
Just love your videos!!
I never understand when you explain what you're doing or moving on to next but I'm here for it.
Oh dude those metal crates would have made awesome work benches so you wouldn’t have to do so much on the ground, it’ll save your back big time. Bummer
Check into 9ft plywood to save on waste with the spacing of the rafters non traditional
Spencer can actually start a business with building home containers. All he has to do is hire help and boom💥a business. Love hearing Bo talk. Crazy how we watch the kids grow with u guys. Almost like “Full House” with the Olson twins lol. But u guys are great! Love the videos
Doing good job 😊
His doing so many cut errors these days. He must be tired
You can never have too much support when dealing with a structure. Lol or "stffener".
what's this mom?  lol
All those CONTAINER home videos are a scam and BS. You actually put more work into it than into a wooden structure and its pointless and it looks ugly.  But simple minded people let themselves be fooled by videos and nice manipulative talk. There are actually activists out there exposing this BS trend that some scammers managed to make popular.  _______________________________________________________________________      First Issue: the size constraints. Standard shipping containers are 20 feet and 40 feet long and 8 feet wide. Most of these containers are 8.5 feet tall but you can order custom ones that are 9.5 feet tall.      Second issue: A metal container works as a system, the idea that every part of this box is structural is false. Every single cut that you make for plumbing, windows, doors, roof openings into its structural frame or corrugated metal siding compromises its strength so you have to reinforce it with metal or wood.      Third issue: the thermal conductivity of steel. It’s not a good insulator, so you can expect the inside of these containers to get very hot in summer and very cold in winter.      Fourth issue: the health risks that come with buying old shipping containers. You can track the locations that the container has been to around the world, but you can’t track exactly what it has carried. It could have carried toxic chemicals such as pesticides or fumigants and the contents might have leaked into the wooden floorboards.      Fifth issue: this type of building is not the best for all locations. It might make sense in coastal regions near port cities where a container is readily available. If you are inland, the cost to transport it all the way to your plot of land is not logical. Also, building with native materials is the most eco-friendly and cost-effective method.      Sixth issue: the idea that you are saving the environment when you use shipping containers and that is a highly sustainable practice. Another important thing to consider is the carbon footprint of your container home. Steel construction is not as environmentally friendly as wood.      Seventh issue: the idea that shipping containers can be the solution to the housing crisis in the world but, this crisis is not a technology problem, it’s far more complex. Purely from a financial aspect, it would be cheaper to build a homeless shelter with wood than build a complex shipping container building. This type of building can maybe be 20% cheaper, not more. The modifications that you need to make a metal box livable aren’t cheap.
Another viddy of a man doing all the work and the female looking for camera time clout.
What are you going to use the new container for
Have you guys considered making a tiny shipping container playhouse for the kids? , so many possibilities especially with Spencer’s talent!
Since you plan for it to be mobile you should put a "deck" or "porch" on the roof
Is Spencer wearing Katonka? 🤣😂🤣
It so beautiful seeing your family grow and watching them getting involved with your projects. Love from Georgia, USA 🇺🇸 ❤😎 You guys are Awesome Sauce 🎉
☀️🇦🇺
Your daughter is growing in leaps and bounds...such a well spoken little woman!! The cabin is forming up nicely...Spencer...you got this!! Awesome job team!!          👍🐺🧙‍♂️🦊👍!!
I've been following along your journey for almost 2 years now. It's so nice to have something positive and calming to watch and your little family is so sweet. I hope you will consider doing a storm shelter in the future.  Not only for the benefit of having it but also I think it would be a really interesting project to document.
Your cinematic scenes are just awesome you must be working really hard improving your skill because they are getting better and better since you first started filming!   Great job !
It drives me crazy that all the cutouts for the windows are slightly higher than the door-cutouts. I still believe there’s been some thoughts to it but I didn’t get it yet.
Hope you are planning on adding on a covered porch to this container.  Because outdoor space is so important.
Snap your fingers and they will be 15 and not give a hoot what you are up to just as long as you leave them alone. 😢.  Empty nest is about the same but eventually they figure out adulting and then they come back around 👍
Looking Good!
Y’all make a great team! Love watching you all. Rest some.❤️
Spencer retire those shoes bud. Great video btw!
Bad news is they get hit by big burst of lighting so live free little birds until !
Your guys are awesome 😎😎
Don't forget to spend a FORTUNE on insulating that oven with windows.
How is your Harbor Freight tools held up?
I really enjoy watching you guys and understand this is how you earn money...But, give me some direction.  Where are we going?  Am I going to just watch another container build?
I have watched you build your house from the beginning to the end. Love watching this show
Love you guys!
Watching this makes my back hurt. Spencer, YOU DA MAN!!  You are amazing!
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👍🏻 love the videos
I hope you guys love it. I have a shipping container also 😂
Are the frames ment to be welded all the way round ? If so you can see some day light on some of them in the lower sections , keep up the great content
My boy Spencer needs new work shoes or new vans lol
Beau is going to end up working with something having to do with Construction! She’s adorable!  😊
You stole that from him those days are long gone
Do you think there is any chance you'd use the cabin as an AirBnB for guests/fans?
There's better reasons to be called Nine Inch Male.
My little girl just turned 40. You have no idea how fast time goes by. Enjoy every minute while you can!💗
Pond is looking goooodd....Loving the window arrangement and doors in the "studio/mother in law suite/granny pod, whatever...lol Love ya'll ❤️
how is Starlink working for y'all?   We live in Aggieland.  A bit more crowded here and we are seeing performance drop a bit.
As someone who was in their prime and is happily not in my prime anymore, I can assure you that both of you guys are usda prime.
Love her curls!! And her sweet voice
That boy needs some new working shoes🤪😘
Lets live in rabbit hutches next...would Elon live in this ...
Spencer, I’m really surprised that you haven’t built an outside workbench instead of working on the ground all the time. I think that would’ve been a high priority with me, especially with all the welding you do. Just a thought.
Why didn't you just stick build?  Less work!
Those 2 trees to the left of the container's back doors, one I recognize is a pine, are going to crush your new roof in this future because they are both leaning towards it! I'd cut them down, before going any further on the roof construction, if it were me!
24 5/8" + 24 5/8" = 49 3/8".   Plywood is 48" wide.   You are going to waste a lot of plywood sheathing.
You guys will miss your kids asking the same question a zillion times. My daughter is 21 and a few months from getting married. Life makes them very busy. Enjoy what you have in front of you.
I think Spencer might need some new shoes lol
why not just use wood? whats better about shipping containers?
I envy people that can do incredible things like this. Then again I am a lazy bastard
The Lake looks so good now. Beau sure follows her daddy.
What is next for the family in 2023? And your daughter is so smart and asking a lot of questions.🎀🤓💖🤩✨🤔⭐️🥰
Do you ever fish in the pond?
Yes the pond is looking great since you had it cleaned out should stay like that for a long time right
Oh those curls!
👌👌👍
My kids are 26, 28 and 30 and they ask me almost every day "What are your doing".  When you raise kids the way you two are, they will always want to know what your doing.  That's because you show them how much they mean to you and that investment will be returned when they get older.
❤️
Thought that was a young Bob Ross there for a minute lol
Ppl want to see pond videos
The developments are sharpimg up well and can't wait to see the next video upload. It's nice seeing your children wanting to assist in painting.
Loving the pond too! Is your otter fam still around? 🥰
It’s so true….. don’t wish your life away….. it goes by way too fast as it is. Before you know it, your kids will be in their 20s and 30s and you will have 7 grandchildren like me. It feels like just yesterday my 4 kids were from 0-7 years old! Now my grandkids are! Enjoy life to the fullest, every minute of every day because it passes you by in an instant…….😢
PLEASE WEAR EAR PROTECTION WHEN USING THE GRINDER!!
Wow!! Lots of progress !!  PONd LOOKS  MUCH HEALTHIER! TAKE CARE!! L9VE YOU ALL!! Peace to all ......♥︎♥︎♥︎`♥︎
Hi. Question... instead of welding frames for doors and windows, could there not be a way to use wooden frames instead? Maybe 2x4 for windows and 4x4 for door frames?
You should start doing daily vlog channel it's pleasure too see the beautiful trees ponds and all things..
Spencer, you just keep building your shipping container guest  home and we will just keep watching cuz I'm not sure any of us really understand what you are talking about when it comes to the roof. I am glad the windows are finally done and the doors looking forward to seeing the next steps in your project love how you recycle things when you can. God bless you guys, 🤗
Love this!  Great job!  it's inspirational!
If you lay the roof truss out at 24 and 15/16 you'll have a ton of waste on your roofing material unless you buy 10' sheets of plywood. There won't be a truss at 48" or 96" to join the seams of the plywood.
If you have a leaf blower I would put it to good use and clear the area of all leaves and pine needles.
Hey Spencer, do what you have to do , I'm 💯 with you, you inspired me so much man
Personally,  it looks cramped and narrow. I would have slapped two containers side by side and welded them together.  ✌😊
Right before my son joined the military 6 years ago he would say MAA MA MAMA.
#whayadoindaddy
Can hardly wait to see the further builds ! You guys sure help make watching your videos interesting  ! Hurry up and post the next one  ! Hee Hee Hee  ..... just kidding  ! Take care of yourselves and especially your babies  ! Aloha
Bit by bit it’s coming together 👊
This is exciting.
♥️👍
Enjoy it while you can,I remember when my daughter was that age, and now she’s 36 wow 😯 how time flies.And now she lives in another state and I hear from every couple of weeks now.🙂 great observation!
Don’t forget the stage in-between where everything you do embarrasses them
Just weld some flat bar behind the top and bottom of the patch, or just one or the other
Lol , what's with the " what's this Mom " business ??? Whatever happened to " Mommy " ???? hahahahahaha . Beau's too cute , lol .
How bout a viewing roof for telescope nights, with rails, lights & outside step's.
https://youtu.be/1P3MmEUE4T0
Love your beautiful family and your wonderful videos.
Am betting that Cam WILL get his word in only after he goes away to university. PS........ there are pensioners here awaiting your NEXT video about 2 hs after the one they just watched.
Spencer and Mackenzie I'll see the container builder going well hope you're having fun I love what I see so far, I see the little lady is talkin and talkin McKenzie you are right when they grow up
You're going to regret the roof rafter spacing. You now have every builder OCDing . Have fun with the big pile of waste off cuts coming from the 4x8 sheets of plywood 😂
Hi to you both from UK. Tip for Spencer Re welder wire feeder ..It helps to keep liner clear of dust dirt etc if you push wire through a foam ear plug ,this s the OD of wire is wiped before entering feeder weels and the liner..Saves blockages.. John  "retired welder "
Wow look at all those juniper berries. Martini?
Nice work 👏
Looking at this build, Mr Spence is doing reminds everyone that a few years ago, you were pretty much at the same spot. The journey can almost be as interesting, McKenzie ! LOL'
You need to get that boy a new paid of tennis shoes!
Looks like you missed the cyclone bomb
What you doing Daddy ☺️.... Stay safe 🙏💗
ARE YOU MEASURING ONCE AND CUTTING TWICE AGAIN LOL
Awesome job 💪🏾💪🏾👏🏽👏🏽👍👍☕️☕️☕️👶🍼👧🥛
When I think back to the time when you started the foundation for the house and now see your dear children. Very impressive and deepest respect!
You have Starlink on your roof ❤
Build an Air BnB!
don't forget to add lots of caulk where you missed with the welding. Lots of spots where daylight is showing through.
Absolutely love the videos guys!! You’re doing an amazing job once again!  Just had a little thought about the use of the roof, as it could be a really cool to try make it a usable space. Maybe, some decking or seating so it could be used as a roof terrace or something like that? Not obviously that you’re sort of space!! But, in terms of keeping with the tiny home vibe, could be cool to try design the roof to be usable?   Keep up the great work and don’t over do it! :)
"Overkill" and "Over-engineer" - 2 terms I use ALL the time on my own container build!! 😆
hahaha 15/16th... i dunno how you Americans do it. Need to speed up that application to the Metric system Spencer :)
I think you should built a tornado shelter just to be safe down there
kindly consider using industrial safety boots rather than the canvas shoes you're wearing, my overthinking mind cringes every time i imagine a heavy tool or heavy metal falling on your feet 🙂
I'm just curious what you guys are going to do after this project's done I've got a suggestion and it'll be cool for your kids and I'm not sure if he is good at fabricating with metal but you guys could build a small Little tikes roller coaster make it to where it is you can make it where it's detachable and you can store it away just a thought it was something I would like to see built LOL
You guys do an excellent job with the kids and all of the rest. Your eldest daughter is absolutely hysterical.   The whole I'm painting routine you do with her is funny.
Can we look forward to a screen porch on the roof...lol  The videos are great been with y'all since the beginning of the Texas videos love the humor
💕
Please get him some proper shoes, you can cut a billiard times, but all it takes, is once where something happens, and he's invalid for life. Same when he is using chainsaw or other equipment, that will cut through flesh and bones like nothing.
Nice new funky track around that 6min mark. I'm feeling it. Spence, like that Bob Ross look. Lastly, before your kids don't care what you're doing, you will get asked, "Why"like a million times on everything they hear.
A Stained glass panel would be nice for the “patch”
So why are you building this little place again?
You know if we thought we were watching a master builder we would be disappointed but the true fans know we are watching two people in love working on there dreams continuing to build a life for themselves this makes for great content wishing you the best
*:::: Newsflash::::* *Kenzie, still not funny.* All kidding aside. I'm so impressed with you guys & your journey.... As a semi-semi, handy dude, Spencer's resoursefullness & ability to improvise (makes up) for the stumbles and I forget you guys started w/a dream in your minds &  *no experience- to start.* *Keep vowing us, Kenzie keep* *editing DaShit out of these videos*  *& we'll keep watching.* *Thanks from your many-many fans*
Am I the only one seeing lots of light between the welded frames and the container. Would have thought they would be fully welded befor you prime. Good idea with some extra supports.
Just want to say just keep up the good work you guys are he’s doing a great job on that don’t forget to press if you make a decision mistake it all happens to all of us
Love your videos .....stunning colours in your sunset ! 🦘🇦🇺
Daddy needs a new pair of shoes! :)
Write 24 15/16 in sharpie next some of the welded pieces! 😊
You will miss those kids, they grow up so fast. One day you’re feeding them baby milk and it seems the next day they’re asking for the car keys. When my kids were small a lady told me they step on your toes when they’re little and step on your heart when they’re grown. That is so true and it’s so hard to remember it’s part of the process.❤
If I didn’t know better, I’d think y’all were an old married couple! That’s not so bad though. I agree with Mom on that comment at the end. Nice work so far!
Your  should make a A businesses out of this os Pelops can come to stay there and you should get some animals as the way your can family can stay there to
I am thinking that an outdoor metal work bench should be in your future.
🙂🙂

Well your daughter stole the show she is absolutely adorable.  The mini cabin is looking good.  Like that you repurposed.
“Don’t wish your life away”  When I was a teen, I would always wish it was Friday during the school year. My dad’s answer was always, “You’re gonna wish your life away!”  When I became an adult, I tried to remember that. It’s not always easy.
Love the work
LOVE Y'ALL. LOOKING GOOD ALREADY
NOTE to self: 24 and 15/16...
That little girl is beyond adorable.
My very first you tube channel.I just love your family 👪
How's life? I love how your projects are progressing, but it seem like we don't really get to see how you guys are living this life you've built. You know what I mean? I hope you six have time to enjoy it as I know the Youtube grind can be hard!
Repeat this in front of her several times dad yes looking good daddy is looking good
Your pond looks SO GOOD! Clear, nice reflections👌 good luck with continuation of the cabin~
Enjoy the little ones while they are young. You are so right that there will come a time when they have no time for us old people.❤
I love u all journey....it make  sense to build a guest container.......I’m still afraid of the poisonous snakes....my kids would never go outdoor😂they would stay on the porches😂......u all are brave
With the hood on Spencer’s head, he looked like Bob Ross but without a perm.  Spencer had a hair straightener.   😂
Look great  job 👍
Instead of patching it, could you just turn it into like a smaller windows it was just a thought, but my guess is you probably already patched it already?
Thinking, ... before installing windows and doors.. Move it to final place to avoid breakage due to flex of the container when moving it...
Buy that man some shoes/boots 🤠
Video end shots look relaxing. nice editing.
Looking good love the puns too
Ever thought about saw horses? Looks good but take it from an old man, Saw Horses. Y'all are awesome.
You will so miss these days, one day 😘
Beau is quickly becoming the star of the show!
Great job Guys. 🙌
Why don’t you make a bigger window?
❤️
Check all your gaps around the window frames and the container I see daylight between them ina few spots Even in the ones that are primed already
Would it be better to use the angle iron around the window frams? They hug better.
Love seeing your little ones helping out, and asking questions.
That may be a 72 dodge fender made in to a piece of angele iron
Super
My wife and I wait patiently for each new episode. We thoroughly enjoy each one
Modern day little house on the prairie...
Yes I wondered about sturdyness- Good job- well thought out
Welding series…………looks great.
Love watching you videos. I've built lots of things with wood, but never anything with metal. But I can't help but think that wood would be cheaper and easier than using a container. I'd love to see you make a video describing the benefits of shipping containers over wood construction, as you see it. Thanks!
Love what your doing.  I want to transform some containers into a home but as soon as I think I'm ready, something happens.  I am a bit perplexed on the roof. If you have spacing that is almost 25" between trusses.  You would not be able to use standard decking being it is 48 inches but your spacing will be 50 wide or if you lay the sheeting the other way the last gap will be almost 4" short.  The standard sheeting is 96" but your gap will be almost 100" you will have 21" waste.  Am I missing something?
Wise words....keep loving those babies.....  This too will pass
get that man a proper work shop. so he can set up a chop saw and a drill press instead of having drill all those holes for the truss's on the roof. a good table to lay out his work. great job guys keep up the good work!!
Your welding skills are awesome!  Great work in moving the misplaced window frame.  I thought you'd like to know that at time 5:40 it looks like the bottom of the window frame  next to the ladder has some holes that have not been welded shut.  Just saying....
You will absolutely miss the days of her asking what are you doing! Trust me on this one! I'm from the future 😉🙂
Will the guest house be an additional burden on the existing solar and water supply?  Or will it have its own setup? Y’all have had occasional issues with low water in the tanks during drought conditions… worried about a worst case scenario of wintertime visitors (short solar day) combined with minimal water in the tank.
You guys r amazing adorable family may your family have all the happiness of the world Ameen
why arent you making the roof out of metal?
There you are, been waiting...
new audio setup is sounding sharp!
❤️✌🏻
Please rethink the 24 5/8” inches.
I think if Spencer were any more laid-back than he is already, he would actually be comatose!
Looks like it would be an awesome fruit stand
A stationary window above the kitchen window…?
🙋‍♀️❤ I was curious about the integrity  of the walls, after the cut outs!  Ah!  Stiffeners! 👍
Where does the time go? The kids are getting so big and adorable. I’m always taken back by the closing theme. I get so engrossed in the video, it just flies by. Be blessed.
VERY artful video — A+
Mam, I don't  know of others but i do care how you guys work and innovate us.
You have no idea how much you will miss these days, Some days i think im going crazy missing my kids so so much.
I am a 61 yo woman...ex pipefitter ( when I was much younger!!! ) and hope to build a container cabin some place far away from ppl with maybe just some horses, cows, and a few chickens and goats.  I am a new subscriber and will follow knowing I am about to learn a whole lotta  stuff....
Terrific video! Great family 🥰 All your content has been fantastic!!
Guys I waiting for the video!!!❤
OMG. That little girl of yours is just so precious. You are so lucky.
Oh gosh Spencer, so much great work you did on this container cabin, and I love seeing all that you are doing and am so excited to see more work getting done. Your pond is looking so beautiful, it is so clear and clean and that is awesome. Your sweet daughter and how much she talks and asks questions is just adorable. Thanks so much for a great video and really looking forward tot he next one, have a great day, sending love and hugs, bye! 😍💜💜💜💜💞
Your lake looks like a painting beautiful
Amaze balls..always watch...greatness,  flaws n' all
Kinz, I love you background music!!
This is good but, please show more of our family vids. I love them too! thanks!!!!!
Kids grow up way to fast...enjoy them while they are small...life changes as they grow...this is the best time with them💓💓💓💓You guys are Great parents!!👍😊 Nice jobs Spencer👍
Your ladder is backwards. The moving part is supposed to be in the front.
That extended spacing is going to cause you issues with your roof sheeting that is 4' X 8'. You are going to be cutting your sheets 6' and a couple inches to land on the rafter. It's going to cause some waste. Fortunately your roof is not that large.
Yo Spence, I'm Exhausted.....time for a brew-ski...
This Family is so darn gorgeous. Kids are growing up so fast enjoy every moment.. Keep up the great work on everything.
Hey guys. where's all the animals? As for supporting the shipping container so you know that it's not going to move on you, you need some center blocks. You're taking a chance spanning the whole 40 feet. My blocks would be 10 feet in on each side, and then in the center. Or at least eight feet in.
Show you using the house you built like cooking, relaxing etc😊
but the one thing that important that you will be able to embarasser her when she is 18 infront of her boyfriend.....if Spencer allows a BF.....lol.....dads RULES HEY
Looks like light shinning through under some of the windows.
Spencer is right. Life goes by too darn fast. and when you have kids faster. Hubby and I have been married 33 years youngest child of three is 37 where in the heck did time go I can't be in my 60's I feel younger than that.
I happened on to your channel when you were laying and painting the floor in your house. Since then, I'm amazed at the amount of knowledge you both have acquired in the passing years. Your work is beautiful. Your home is gorgeous. Your little kiddos are absolutely beautiful. I'm impressed with how wonderful your piece of Heaven is. Love your videos. Bless your family. Happy New Year to ya'll.
The joy of the young curious asking "What's that?"
Hey Spenc . Buddy #always take your ring off when welding man . If i could post pics id show you why . I actually had my anniversary tatted on my ring finger after i melted my ring to it .
Wondering if you have to add solar panels to power the new addition when people visit?
👏👌👌👍
on  your cut out where you welded i can  see day light in some of the places where you welded so with that it will leak water when it rains or wind blowing just trying to help hope  you see my message this is JW in TUCSON AR
You are so wright, because they grow up so fast, you'll say where the time go. Be there and done that.
I think Beau is incredibly smart for her age. Thought that as soon as she started interacting with her parents.
Bro I suggest u make 2 storey contena
Here goes round two of making a shipping container something livable and beautiful. Can’t wait to see this transformation.
Watching y'all makes a hard workweek a little better. Keep up the good work.
Great video!
Love your work 👍
I wonder if the spacing you're looking at is really 320mm? 80mm wide corrugations? For mathmatics purposes that may be easier.
I have a love/hate relationship with the ending music……I love the music but hate the video is ending 😊
Love hearing ya 'll chimes .
Watching you guys work you are both admirable! Reminds me when I was young. Keep up the excellent job you both do and love!
Will you be mounting solar panels on the roof of the container? so it has its own power supply which you could also use to help funnel the rain water into a gutter to collect?
Spencer, 24 15/16" is going to cost you a lot more in roof sheathing because an 8' panel will not fall on the center a truss.  If I were you, I would rethink that idea.
I really  like your channel  , and enjoy the progress along the way. But as you both  know your family  is growing  ,I was wondering  why you guys ever thought of stacking containers on top of one another to give you a second  fl.    Please respond  ?
For your records might want to label it "what you doing Dad!" It's a keeper God bless 🌹
I love watching all of the progress you have made, n watch your little girl Beau helping you is priceless...
Tous mes vœux à la famille ! Santé et bonheur dans votre havre de paix. Félicitations pour tous ces travaux et bon courage pour la suite 😉. Après ce container, un autre ? Et un autre ? ... Et l'ouverture dans camping ? 🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣🤣 Baisers de France (Bordeaux)
I don’t think the little girl needs to be there, it’s very dangerous for children to be near pieces of metal.
I love watching your videos.  Both of you are amazing parents.
Would it not be easier to run your 2x's as normal and just run 1x3 or 1x4 long wise 16" on center and predrill the roofing to match.
Spencer, can I buy you a chop saw? As a fabricator, my heart breaks for you every time you have to cut something with your cutoff wheel. You’re a good man Spencer and you have a very rare talent.
Good job! I'm still a bit concerned that the container will flex when it's moved and possibly break windows and mess up any sheet rock work. I hope I'm wrong.
I've been watching your channel off and on now for a couple of years. I still don't understand the advantage of using shipping containers for buildings. Seems like way way too much extra work. Lumber prices are way down again now, isn't it just more straightforward to use conventional building technology (ie. wood) than all the extra steps you have to do on a shipping container?
👍🏽👋🏽😷
Still not so sure about moving that thing once it's built. Going to break some crap for sure, especially with all those windows.
Love to hear your Daughter do so much taking, also love the way the pond is looking at the present time. be glad that you are getting all that rain,maybe you should get another tank for water as a back-up just in case, enjoy your video's.♥♥♥.
Looking good
Mom mom mom mom……❤
Things are looking good, so much hard work but it pays  off the end results will be amazing. The children have grown to fast but are adorable love seeing Beau helping her dad. Can’t wait til it’s done . God Bless your beautiful family. Happy new year!
How is Bear doing? Is it just that he’s aging or is he ill ?
She’s right Spencer, one day they’ll be grown, move away and never call. But, there’s always grandchildren! So cool, kids you can give back. 😊
Way to go Spencer!  Anybody that works like you do???  Yeah, you still got some!  Take care of that back when you can, smarter not harder.  Best wishes to you and the family!
Life is the process... You guys are living the life!
I sure enjoy your videos,  happy for the way the cabin looks!!
10:11 to 10:29 once again proves you should be doing editing tuts.
The only glitch with 24 5/8” o/c trusses is that plywood comes in 96” lengths and will not span 4 trusses.  You will be cutting every sheet of plywood.
Poor man has no time to comb his hair.
Your videos are excellent, and you continue to get better! Beau seems to get cuter and cuter. Spencer has become quite adept at grinding, welding, fabricating, and all manners of construction. But he has developed this interesting fascination with Proctology! Hmmmm hehehe
Grind time with Spencer 🤣
The pond sure cleaned up and looks just great.  I am looking forward as what the cabin  will look like and it will be beautiful.  Walk in Peace.
Curious. Am I the only one that noticed some daylight peeking through the bottom of the window frames and the walls on some of the shots that showed the bottom of the window and wall? Thanks again for another video. I'm looking forward to seeing how quickly if at all the rest of the build will go now that y'all have the outside walls done. I'm sometimes amazed at how fast a traditional stick built house gets done once the framing is done. May y'all have a good one. Have fun take care
your little girl is a cute helper painting game as she calls it.
🤞
Your music score selection is great!
Love that you ain't selling some stupid VPN thing or anything. Really nice for a change.
Someone needs to make cut-to-size insulated wall panels for gluing inside these containers. You know, molded to fit the corrugations.
The progression of the new build is really fun to watch. Great job.
So cool.
8:20 there are still some gaps in the window welds. You can see daylight.
You are not wrong, Spencer. Those walls hold the shape of the container. Reinforcement is better than a wall bowing out later.
As fairly new /young parents you have no idea what you are in for as your kids get older. You might think you know but there will be proud days and there will be heartbreaking days when your kids absolutely hate you.
Spencer question. How is 24 5/8" divisible  by 4'x8' sheet goods? Better rethink that.
❤
Yeah those sparks in the glove really get your attention, I hope you never experience one in your ear, that's a real wake up call.
What a great craftsman!
Just curious, why the container when it’d be much cheaper to just stick frame that structure. Is it basically an art preference because it’s not cost effective.
Why don't you use glass on top. I think it will look good.
Even though the weather is cooler, I hope Spencer is still putting on sunscreen 🧴
It's not too late but have you considered a sunroof. Little light from above?
The container looks so huge with all those windows.  Good job of repurposing that angle iron!!!
Hi Spencer!!!! I thought it was so cute to hear your daughter ask you over and over WHAT YOU DOING DADDY?? You said painting Baby ... Spencer I thought also with you using Angle iron from your scrap was very smart ... it saved you money and time to go get more .. I like you both to put up more videos if you can cause I really enjoy them when they come on to watch and sometimes I watch them 3 times ... LOL... I will be waiting on the next video Spencer and by the way GREAT JOB BUDDY and don't forget your measurements on the roof it's going to be awhile before putting the roof on ... I guess your son was sleeping with all this video .. I hope all of you are doing well and enjoying the home you both built ... I'm going to say By for now and take care and stay safe ... From your friend THE BANDIT AKA BOB from Illinois....
I know this may be silly but I’d love a water tank level update every video!
Thank you and have a great week. :)
I don't think children brought up as yours are with love and good morals and values will never stop caring  about there parents xx
Happy Year 2023 to Life Uncontained.  May you build go smooth as you continue on.  "Whatcha doin daddie?" ... precious!
I would have made work benches out of the crating material.
Your prime?  You're just beginning!  Neither of you have enough years to be asking that question.  Enjoy this time.  Enjoy your health.  Enjoy the children while they are so little and with you most of the time.  Enjoy the newness of your lives.
You’re a glutton for punishment spencer but you’re determination is to be admired
I love you humor! Laughter keeps you happy and healthy🤣🤣❤️🙏
HELLO 🤗 Spencer you're doing a nice job on the windows 👌 Yes Makenzie you'll look back years from now & cherish these little moments with Beau & Cam 😉 look forward to your videos ☺️ take care🙏🇺🇲
Awesome
Jamaica 🇯🇲 here blessings happy new year to you and your family love how the building is going and how you have a little helper so good  I love how you’re doing well at all you both put your mind and hands to and I know that God will see you and your family through take care and be safe all of you love ya
How many times can you say stiff ???   Lol
Here's a thought...  Someone manufactures these containers.  Duh...  Why doesn't this company get into making them into homes?
Beautiful sky, beautiful family……always dread the ending sad music.
❤❤❤❤❤
Trust me you will miss the times of all the questions from your kids so cute. Mine are grown now but my great nephews remind me of my kids when they ask [what you doing] they grow up fast
Was the music chosen for this video from a Funeral Theme category?
When i hear the song at the end I always scream NOOOOOOOO lol thats when I know it’s over, I always want more but this is exciting cant wait to see what’s next!
Great channel, thanks for all the videos!
Good job. Hey my dad was an Arc welder. Is it the same as what you are doing.???  Love watching.
“Whatcha doin’ daddy?” Definitely treasure those words now. Very rarely do I “hear” those words from my kids anymore!
You're quick with the glove-eject motion. 😀  Very wise of you to stiffen the walls.
I think they are painting themselves into a corner thinking they HAVE to keep building out containers to have a channel.  It's called "Life Uncontained"....the container is built, and they could just focus on life living in a container, and some of the perks/challenges.  BUT if they feel they MUST build out containers for a channel....how about building a LARGER container house (for a growing family)...two story maybe?  Something longer term to build?  The way they are going now...they will exhaust all uniqueness before long..."Container cabin", then "container garage", "container shed", "container storage unit", ect...
Go buy Spencer some new work shoes!!  His toes are coming out of them!!  Lol.  Makes my feet cold just watching.  Can’t wait to see how this in law cabin comes out!!!!
I saw in this video that you had a hot spark get into your glove.   I hope it didn't do what I once did to myself which was a spark attached to my Wedding  Ring  ! it Burt the whole of the circumference of my Ring finger beneath my Ring.  I never wore any jewellery  or Watches od anything  else that the same might happen to.  FYI. We used to say that as soon as  spark burnt through your skin & touched the blood it cooled down  significantly    !!   lol  😆
Your back nice to see you guys.. Hi from Australia..
Why so many windows if I may ask
I appreciate your hard work, but i can't see how shipping containers are economical or practical for this application.  So much work is required that the only thing you're getting for the price of the container is some siding and floor.  This is the way to make a difficult job 10x more difficult.
Great job! Wish I was younger to tackle those projects. You guys go!
Seems how you are on youtube every three or four weeks making 18 minute videos, I will wait until you make at least five videos and then watch them.  I do enjoy seeing you and your family tho.  Just one short video here and there gets annoying.
Why aren't you covering the window and door openings to prevent rain getting inside the container?  Sheets of heavy mil plastic taped on the outside would do a good job.  Easy to put up, easy to remove.  Just a thought.
The pond!! GASP! So glad you gave an update! Beau needs a bucket of watercolor!
well when are you going doors and windows for it
It looked like in a couple of shots that there was daylight showing through some of the welds after he got the primer on everything. Just wanted to mention it just in case.
Each time you say the cutouts are done, I see daylight through the cracks and wonder if I'm missing something...
"Don't wish your life away." Smartest thing I've ever heard you say.
I may have missed this, but will the new container be an Airbnb or guest house for just family? How far away from your house will it be?
Everything was going so good, until the dreaded music.
the fact that the door and the window next to each other aren't the same hight would drive me insane!
Awesome job guys 😊
Spencer, you looked like Bob Villa with your hair do. 😀
I am excited about this build.  Waiting patiently for the next fun filled video.  See you next time.
Some thing you might want to try with your daughter is when she asks you what you’re doing try asking her what do you think I’m doing so she starts using more words
Bear Bear and I O need a nice place to get out of the weather. So something with AC and Heating would be great
Love you guys - been watching from the beginning. Are you worried about any of the finishes or installations cracking from the container flexing when you move it?  All the best - Matt & Kat (Things)
why you put soo much windows in this box ?
That jacket with the fur around it is hilarious it looks like his real hair like he’s some crazy person from the woods lol
Enjoy the moment, don't wish your life away. Love it
Thank you for explaining that because I was wondering if the stability of the container was being compromised by all those new holes. I don’t think it’s overkill at all especially since you have to move it somewhere else. It’s just protecting what you’ve already done and you don’t want any bending it when it’s moving from one place to the other or even if it just sitting still the wind you don’t want the stability of the place to be Compromised. Love seeing how it’s coming together.
Love to see the process from beginning to end just like your home!! Awesome videography 👏🏻👍🏻
How sweet......Cam had his dad's exact look, as he held him...lol!
Been wondering for a long time….what is the duty cycle of your welder…never see you frustrated waiting.
Why movable?! And to where?
You need some new work shoes or boots.
You should make a deck on the roof with a railing and a spiral staircase on the side
Time for a paddle boat or just a paddle boat. So fun!
Hi, and hey, :) You could build a little dormer overhang over the piece you had to put back over the window. That would hide the welded seam above the window. Just saying :):)
Happy New Year guys
Spencer trust me when I say, you ARE still in your prime....and Kenz is right there will come a day when you're gonna miss your little curly head shadow. Of course  she could end up working with you in construction. That would be very cool.  ;-)  Or she could just follow you around filming everything you do... It really occurred to me how 'normal' the kids are going to think having their lives recorded is.     I'm getting to not liking that ending music again.  : - !
Beau is so precious!  You are right, you are going to miss those moments one day, cherish them now!  ❤️
Lil Mckenzie 🤣💞
So nice to see “young” people make the best of what they have and can stay positive! Like seeing all the work, and the fine editing of the vids! But PLEASE, Kenzie - BUY THE MAN SOME WORK BOOTS!!!!😁😁
Live in the moment, live in the now because if we live in the future we MISS the present moment. It's totally amazing so far what you are accomplishing on  the second container.  Looks good.  God Bless you ALL.
McKenzie, you hit the nail on the head with the”one day they won’t care what we’re doing”😊
Why aren’t you building it in its permanent foundation?
Kensie, I have a question for you. Do you think Spencer is still in his prime? I bet your answer is, YES, DEFINITELY!
I think Beau's going to grow up to be very handy!  She's adorable! Well they both are, but Spencer's Shadow is very cute!
She asked if you thought you were in your prime. You are perfectly in your prime.  She should have answered that for you 😅
Looking good!! Keep up the good work!!     ❣❣❤❣❣
Trust me. You’ll miss those days. (10:03) I miss them every single day. I love watching your little family. It reminds me of mine and all of the things that my husband and I used to do. We did everything ourselves as well, so it’s refreshing to see. I’m a widow, and you guys give me so much joy watching all of the progress, and watching the little ones grow. Continue on. Wishing you much happiness and blessings from SC❤
Your comment at 9:50 could not be more true. My little girl is now 20, how I remember her interest and fascination with all things daddy is only a fond memory now.
I have few if any doubts about the people who have friendly close contact and connections with you and how proud they must be of all that have been able to accomplish. The two of you really come across as being authentic, Clean fun down to earth people. You seem to have so many positive personal qualities. I'm really happy that the two of you made the decision to share of yourselves and become public figures on YouTube.
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸☕️☕️☕️👀👀👀🥃🥃🥃🍻🍻🍻👍👍👍🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Spencer from one balding dude to another…try a buzz cut.  You’ll be glad you did!
6mins 24 secs.  Been there - done that.  Of course it's always funny afterwards .. and especially funny when it happens to some one else.
I can't wait to see what it going to look like when yall r finished!!
Words of wisdom. Battling the empty nest here.
Anything over 13'6" high is considered overheight and requires permits to move on any state maintained road... to stay under that 13'6" u can no longer transport it on the frame semi trucks use...now u need a low boy trailer.. or overheight permit...
When you think that these days are gone, I in that case feel very jealous of you, you guys have these beautiful videos of their full lives, and before. I have three beautiful daughters, all married, and I have 6 grandchildren, plus a extra, granddaughter through my one daughter's marriage. So you can understand when I am near to the next lot, gson 23 gdaughter 21and a half gson 22 and a half gdaughter 18 gson 16 gdaughter 10 step gdaughter 16. so yes I'm jealous, envious, wish I had your advantage, and I know you will start very soon start looking back, and I'll do it with you. Love going back on all your videos. Keep it up and S should appreciate his little princess helper. much love,  Marjo South Africa. Be blessed.
Such a nice view in all different moments and angles of the area...rain, sun, night moments, ⭐️ and more...very day a different way...and just sharing when I was as small as your daughter is now I was just anxious about helping mom in the washing dishes, but she was very happy with and used strong words on not wishing me to be in it....soon I just wanted to be with her in the kitchen...teenager time was not fun, but with my aunt I always helped her enjoying the kitchen with her. My aunt always put us all cousins together during summer vacations and her house and of course we need to to help ...my favorite one was doing the dishes ....and with my boys I learned that whenI was positive and motivating them in everything they learned to enjoy it al...Christmas time was my favorite one and so became theirs ....positiveness and motivation together with patience do help us kids in wishing to always be helpful...kkkk...so as you do kip up enjoying their company and their curiosity they will become your partners  🤗💝
What seems nuisance conversions with your kids is what you’ll miss the most. 😢
2:12 Confucius says Don't wish your life away! Or you will be dreaming everyday!
5:40 There is a open gap under the one window, incase you didn't see that. probably dont want that left open.
Specter is a beast! And you’re BOTH still very much in your prime! ❤
Have you considered bringing in another guy to help?   Spencer might enjoy a helper?        I grew up singing gospel music...travelling.   i followed Bill and Gloria Gaither a lot in music.   They are pillers in that industry.  They always sang in groups.....they were amazing until....they brought Mark Lowry...he was funny and very smart.  From that point their music went massively huge.  People loved the humour and serious.      You two are amazing....i've been here since the beginning.   I think spencer needs help.
👍👍. ❤️❤️. 🌞🇨🇦
why is it not in it's resting place now?  I might have missed an episode.
Glad the cabin build is moving along. It sure is going to be cool at its permanent place.
Hey McKenzie. My wife and I are having a disagreement we hope you can help with. What colour is your hair. ?
I was wondering how your water supply is with all the rain.
Bo is such a good helpe=
DId you all do anything about the water tanks & heat for any upcoming freezing temps??
Bigfoot,  I like watching your blog, Keep up the good work stay safe.
Maybe you should start a business making tiny home shipping containers
Rule no1 of welding never wear rings while welding that bebe will hit that ring and almost fuse it to your finger, i have seen it happen to many times.
Spencer had hair!!!!
Hey what ever happened to the pond pump aeration thing
Be careful not to wear any rings, because it may arc off your and severely burn you.
I am with you Kenzie, I’m always looking forward to the next thing before I’ve finished, but then I get into mistakes!   Looking forward excitedly keeps me going in life though 😀.  Well done both of you again.   So enjoy your vlogs thanks.
So funny he looks like an evil character from the kids movie funny😂you guys are amazing love watching you every week.actually I look forward to the videos 🙏🏾🦋♥️
You've raised a "Helper"!!  Congrats - one of the signs of good parenting.  And she's a dolly, too!!
How cute little Miss Beau priming with Daddy. Precious moments. Pond looks good after all the rain. Container taking shape. Take care and have a great week.
Pond looking great and  I love watching the building and figuring out and techniques. The children are so sweet and true indeed, some day they don't ask you what you are doing..........cherish those moments and so glad you have film documentation to "remember when".................build is going well and I can't wait to see what comes next!
👏👏👏👏
What are you plans for outside entertainment and shade?   Have you considered  extending the roofline over the entrance and making provision for patio roof?  Are you going to place it overlooking the pond seeing as you have done the work to make it worth looking at?
your kids are just too cute. its taking shape already nice job.
There will also come the day you pick them up and put them down for the last time. Treasure these moments.
Great memories with your children ❤️. The pond looks great. 👏
Saw an ad online earlier that showed a container modified that looked like the exact thing you guys are building?
Is anyone else concerned about all the sunlight shining through those window frame welds?
So true, one day you're listening to them ask questions and the next they're grown with a life of their own and too busy to stop and say hi.
Looks like Spencer could use some new shoes! Lol Looking great you guys. Loved your videos ❤
Spencer makes everything so interesting that I hope you’ll continue for at least another ten years.👍👍👍
Oh please shut the door on the welder. That spool of wire should be electrified when he is welding. I would hate to see one of the kids get hurt.
Your growth in life and as a family is such an inspiration  to me and my family thanks guys God Bless ps yaw got this
Christmas with your little nuggets must have been adorable and fun.  Patty
Hi really enjoyed watching your video doing a great job on the build looking really good really looking forward to seeing your next video keep safe 😷👍🏻
😳 OMG you guys are so funny yes Spencer look like a werewolf
"What are you doing Daddy?"  😂 Just love it!  🥰
Can't wait to see the finished product.  Keep your eyes protected from the sparks my dad used to be a journeyman welder, and trust me he came home anytime to the size pitch red because he didn't leave his eyes protected. If you see any kind of cracks or any kind of breakage in the hood or eye protector change it get it fixed but don't do any welding. 😁
Still enjoying you guys after all this time,to bad you couldn't make your mistake window hole stained glass..😸
Its funny how they (kids forget about us) and then we start asking how they doing in their busy work lives!! ja ja ja
Enjoy the proses!! 😂😂😂
Enjoy the proses!! 😂😂😂
Enjoy the proses!! 😂😂😂
I just don’t understand why they always do all these little windows! It’s like doing all those windows takes away the space of the container when they could of easily made the two ends or one end a huge window floor to ceiling and small window in kitchen area.
when did Starlink Happen... looking for it in a video, but?
I love Spencer's "safety" shoes 😱
You will definitely miss them asking what you’re doing. They will grow up, move out and start families of their own and it will happen in the blink of an eye! From someone who is just now experiencing this myself I can say it’s no fun. Enjoy the journey because it will end!

Been waiting for this. Thank you guys
Talking of male prime. I was 50 when I noticed the changes. I’ve been in the building trade all my life and by 60 I was ready for retirement. We can’t retire here in the UK until 66 now. I’m 64 now and can barely work. Life is shit sometimes. Spencer has got plenty of life left in him yet though.
Nice video. GBY.
I just watched another episode of "groundhog day". Its quite apparent that you have run out of ideas.  The first series was really interesting.  The mistakes, struggles and improvement as time went on. The video editing even improved.  Your channel now has no goals, no meaning and .......you are milking this by only welding a little or by placing one window per episode......then cut to all the same b-roll.  I get it, your making $$$$ and you are trying to make it last.  I just can't watch this any more. Sorry
😊👋🏻 Firstly, the Pond looks amazing!! Secondly, when did you all film this  with all that beautiful green grass and T-shirt weather?
Do you still have animals?     Used to see them around pond.
:)
I love how this build is coming along. Your little daughter is so beautiful with those long curls. Your son is at such a cute stage in life soaking it all in. I love watching you build another beauful vacation home with such perfection and careful planning.
Looking good! What you doing babe?! So adorable. Love them up while you can.
The power source of the Solar Panels.  Will this cover the new building?
"One day, they won't care what your doing..." I doubt that. Your kids are growing up in an environment that they are loved and cared for. Stay involved, stay connected. Your children will learn how important that is from what you teach them. We have 3 kids, 23, 16, and 15. They all know they are loved and cared for, and care for us. Watching your channel over the years seeing the progress of the build, the progress of your family growing, it is safe to say that you got this. Keep going. Don't ever give up. Prayers for you all!  I love this channel and you guys!
Spencer - always remove your ring before welding. If a glow gets between ring and finger it's bad. My brother had that happen to him - not fun !
What about adding a solar roof onto the cabin? That way even the cabin is independent of the main solar system.
Awe you two Rock!! And those cuties of yours are the cherry on the top!! May you always stay blessed. I enjoy your channel, it gives me hope that Young people are making the future better so Thank You!💖💖
One talented  family
I would have kept the metal angle iron frames and made a work bench for the other container
the pond is really beautiful love the tiny house y'all are making... y'all should take us for a walk & show us where y'all are thinking of putting it 💕  I think the other side of the pond would be ideal (but that's just me🙂) it's looks really nice so far
"One day, they won't care what we're doing." As a dad of five, three of which are grown-up, I must say this is true.
love every video from waaay back lol.  Glad to hear the great music back,  I  missed it. Love from Gordon - Ireland
What breed is IO
You should put wheels on it and by a semi to pull it
Loved the time you all spent to take us along with his build! Blessings to you 🙏 ✨️
Do a widows peak accessible from the outside.
Paint, not pair - dang auto correct!! ha
Hope yall never have to deal with with what those guys at pure living for life are dealing with.  Stay safe. Keep em coming, love these vids.
Love watching your show, and keep up the great work. 👍I was checking out your on the window openings.  I see a lot of daylight underneath of some windows . Just bring it to your attention.   I just figured I'll share it with you.    Also you should look into dying your pond it does not hurt to fish or wildlife that drinks the water it just makes the pond look a lot better but the pond looks great check it out when you get a chance.
I love Spencer's safety shoes XD
Spencer, your so lucky to have such good help. My son when he was 2 helped me pair a spot on the outside behind some flowers. He never finished it, I left it and was a joke between us. He died at home suddenly of cardiac arrest at 37. I now cherish that spot!! Great stuff!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
What a beautiful place.
The pond looks so beautiful now 😍.  Just make sure you have everything welded, I thought I seen some light in spots.  This is going to be so awesome when completed.
Just going to say it now: you're going to regret going with 24 5/8" spacing. It means that every single piece of wood will need to be cut to custom length to land on a rafter.
I've been watching your channel since you started it. It is so amazing what you've both accomplished in the last 4 years. Your children are so beautiful. May you be blessed throughout the year.
For the pond consider creation your own Bio-Filter.  I have one and is super-efficient. Cristal clear water.  Look this one https://youtu.be/a45ypFaGkHk
You are such a lovely family and work hard together xx
One of my favorite shows. Always interesting and always pleasant.
I can't wait for the final iteration of this trailer---right now it has the look of a rundown '50's motel out in the middle of a nowhere town in the desert of Nevada or Arizona.  As a kid, I remember seeing something like this as we drove past some tumbleweed towns out there.  Bet you were waiting all day for this observation, eh?  lol  Love Hubby's little helper---what a cutie!
Holy Smokes….buy that man of yours some new shoes!
👍🏻😊
As usual, serious and good job. I ❤️ your little family and watching your videos.
Beau is PRECIOUS!❤️❤️❤️
You two are making all this look easy! I know! Don’t choke! Lol but seriously now Spencer you are the man! So sweet to your family so loving and so strong and talented with the tools. Kenzie, your skills with the camera are really amazing! The love and attention you give your babies is inspiring and is helping them to grow loved and secure. Thanks for another great video. Much ❤️
Just keep swimming, and be safe and God bless amen
You are a great videographer.  Love the nature shots.  👊  Video and audio quality is very good.
Hiya Spencer and Kensie
Beau is absolutely gorgeous, she is so inquisitive. Cam is growing so fast. I’m really happy that y’all decided to do another shipping container home.
I think the stiffners are a great idea to extra support.  You need that support to replace the strength of the metal wall where you've removed that floor to ceiling strength of metal by cutting it out.  I was  wondering how u were going to do that.   When I saw all those cutouts so close together,  i thought , whoa,  what is holding that wall up.   All the strength is gone.   So filing that in is a great idea.
Please Kens, can you show us a better view of the pond? I just can get enough!
I just love watching you weld ….  This is going to be a beautiful addition to the property ❤
Spencer Bobba Fet Welder.
I love your channel, and your non stop energy! I am sure you've thought of this, but I can't help but wonder, your plans of solar power for the new build? New panels or share power with current system??
Did you try 19-3/16" rafter spacing? That would give you a rafter at each roof sheathing panel edge.
Hello from Ocala Fl !  Long time subscriber and I have a suggestion, since Spencer is so dang talented ( which he is ! ) how about buying some smaller containers, converting them to basic hunting camp lodging and sell them ? Just do one at a time, leave them basic and put them online. Keep up the great work and great videos !
Enjoy this so much ❤
Too darling
Very impressive! Spencer talks about measurements and things that I don't understand at all,and I'm thinking, how in the world did this guy get so dang smart!? I've been following yall since the beginning and feel  like you're family🤗🧡Love you guys so much and look forward to your videos.Much love from Grandma Dedra in Ga. 🧡
Listening to Beau talk to her daddy is so sweet! Future builders in the making. Now we await the next one!
@12:57 Spencer’s shadow looks just like a bulldog sitting on its Rear End watching what he’s doing ! Hahahahaha 😂🤣
Good to see you guys back!! Happy new year!! Cape Town, South Africa!!
I would love to have a day of your live episode!
another great vid you guys are so impressive
Cool!
So glad to see you ive been checking every day.Happy New Year to you.the container is coming along fine .i love all the windows its going to be so light in there  just fancy waking  up to those beautifull view's.beau is such a sweet little girl and she loves helping her Daddy doesen't she.love from England.🤗
This always goes too fast. I could watch this for a lot longer,  but I know that this takes a lot of work and you have your hands full with a new built and training your employee on how to paint. 😀  She is so sweet. 😍
I just wish your videos were a tad bit longer. You film for several days and edit everything down to about 15 minutes and I just wish they were a little bit longer only cause I enjoy them so much! Your doing a great job once again spencer!!!!
I can honestly say, I have to take back something I said, many many years ago. I was between 5th-6th grade when I first travelled to Texas. It was in the month of August. HOT/DRY/BROWN. Coming from Michigan, I absolutely hated Texas. Within days, we were in Brownsville and Hurricane Beulah roared thru. Hot/Wet/Brown. Really really hated Texas. A month or so later we left and landed in Kansas City, Mo. I swore, God could take Texas off the map, and I would NEVER miss Texas. I have returned on several occasions for family matters. Still hate Texas.  Today, I watched the video above from "Life Uncontained".  The pink sky, the Pine trees, the pond, ................is beautiful. I can almost smell the wind in the trees. It is clear to me now, why a person could fall in love with THIS little heavan in Texas.
Mackenzie..... you're hair is still absolutely amazing!
Família Linda!...
Kuz we Kan is doing theirs by themselves too.   Two ladies alone.   Amazing workers.    Mill their own lumber.   Raising beams for a barn.     Go see.   !
Looking good! instead of relying on  video to remind you of the spacing, just write it in a couple or three spots on the roof and protect it with clear packing tape so the the number is always at hand to read. Happy New Year!
Repurposing feels so good.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kenzi-your videography/music selection is second to none!!!! I could watch an entire video of nothing but that-Sooo relaxing-Thank you!!!
Also Are we there yet daddy. LOL
Great job on the build......@ 10:34 in the video looking at the bottom of the large end window it looks like Spencer missed some welds on the vary bottom....dont know if that will be an issue. But I love all you both do for viewers!!!!!!!!!
Dude, you need to get a portable worktable. All that time stooped over and on your knees is going catch up to you at some point. Speaking from experience here.
The likelihood of it happening is pretty slim but you shouldn't weld with a ring on as the ark could jump through the ring if your ring gets in between the welding gun and your ground it is more possible when doing art welding but it's just better practice to remove your ring when welding so you don't remove your finger when welding
more videos more often please!
My kids knew exactly what tool I needed next, and that is the one they would run off with. Enjoy it goes too fast.
Happy New Year guys. Ready to watch you getting this one done too.
Love listening to your daughter chatter away with all her questions,  that is the most fun when they are growing up.
Spencer and Kenz, if that nice pond is yours you need to pay a trapper to remove those otters  or they will wipe out all the fish in your pond in a moth or two and then move on. Snapping turtles will do the same as will herons if the depth is shallow. The depth will make no difference to the snappers and the otters. Good luck.
Your filming is getting amazing. I look forward to every video because there's some new technique incorporated into each one.
Spencer, your wife just asked you if you thought that you were in your prime? The answer to that is How are your back and knees holding up? The significant stress that this build has put on either of those body parts, should give you some sort of indication how much longer you have until the SH— hits the fan! Then you will know😅
Bo is growing so fast.
Spencer is a Work Horse. There’s nothing he can’t do. I admire his Ambition to continue to build. Kenzie you are great to cheer him on. !!! Love you guys!!❤️❤️❤️😁😁😁
When are you going to Build your amazing work shop !?!?!?
The Beau “segment” was the cutest thing I’ve ever seen ❤️
Hey Spence and MacKenzie I have been watching you guys for years, since you started and I absolutely love you and the content you create, you make me laugh and it sounds funny but I feel as though your like my best friends . Lmao I would like to see longer videos because I just love watching your videos. When it ends I feel jipped and sad that that was it. You make my day! I'm always patiently waiting for your next video. I have never commented in all the years but I thought I would today and tell you that, you guys are the best! And I'm excited to see more videos this year.  Kate From B.C. Canada
Your pond looks so nice. I love your videos. Fun listening to your daughter asking daddy what he's doing. Makes me think of my daughter when she was little. Brings about some memories. Sooo cute!
Are you worried at all about the unit sinking? Since it's only on blocks.
Yes you are going to miss these days! But you have it all on video 🙏❤️🥰
(17:28) Wow look at those smoke arcs! And Prime is just a subscription you can renew at any time to be in your prime.
I miss those days. My son favorite thing was dad. Hey hey dad, how much do you love me?
Spencer with all of the welding and grinding and cold weather, you need some work boots. Those tennies can not provide much protection. Just sayin.
Nice job with the build. You have some truly beautiful footage of the sky and your place. Take care!
Another good job you got a little work to do but after you get that done I still think you need to build yourself a workshop God bless
You could build container homes to sell you do great work love your videos
So handsome Spencer,keep that hair style. I am only joking.
What about that tree leaning toward the Container?
One correction as I see the love you show your children now there will always be a returned love forever from both of them.
Please, please use the metric system !
Spencer in his black parka-wig: ¡ay caramba! 😃🙄 The pond looks clean and clear, by the way; that aerator device made a huge difference!
awesomer !!!!!!
You guys need to get all that equipment, tractor and implements under a roof.  There are companies out there that can do that pretty cheap.  Plus you need an actual workshop.
Hey Spencer how about a lounge/patio up on that roof? Might be an awesome feature. Just think about looking over your pond at night from that perspective.
Youmwill find the container will be metric so no 24 and 14/15ths or what every crazy number that is but will be something like 64cm🤦‍♂️
Spencer you are in your element now. Rocking daddy and rolling welder and fabricator.
Love how it's moving along!
Love your videos always, you have a lovely family.
That can needs to go up higher so you can work under it and build a deck around it. Oh edit,, why isn't the can sitting in it's final resting place??? I'd think that would be the first thing that is done??? Also 19.2" on center gives you a rafter every 8 feet. If you check your tape measure you should see a mark there.
Some views of this project makes me think your building a Hotdog / Burger stand for a carnival or county fair.  LOL
I love the sounds of your sweet babies chatter. A childhood is so very short and is gone before you realize it, enjoy every day and every moment with those sweet ones
Love hearing your daughter talk.  Fond memories of kids and grand kids.
Have enjoyed watching you two grow and build for a few years now. There is how ever one thing I don't understand, why don't you at least have some chickens and a small garden?
Love ❤️ you guys, and your children are so adorable 😍 I look forward to your next video 📹
Keep a journal
I remember the days of my girls asking, what you doin Mommy. Now they're grown and my grandkids are all grown and I miss those days so much. What I wouldn't give to hear again, what you doin Mommy.
Your good at grinding spencer 🤣🤣😂😂
I have never understood why people want a roof deck, but if they like building them and use them why not right?
☺️👍
You guys are so amazing. The cabin build is looking good. And to think Spencer is basically self taught. BONUS!
shes a daddys girl for sure always wants to know what daddys doing and i love her curls shes so cute
Curious why so many windows? I worry about privacy. Love job so far.
Your daughter is getting so big!!
MIssed you guys, its been a long 2 weeks? Kept checking up for new updates. :)
You are going to need to build 2x4 I-beam joist for the roof because plywood is 4 ft x 8 ft or you will have a lot of waste 24 and 5/8 is not going to line up on 2x4s every time
I see daylight thru some of your welds?
You can build them and then sell them
I think you are wise putting a pitched roof on it I have worked on generators that were fitted in those containers which had an easy life and we had a lot were the roof rotted through also I would put a rust converter on the roof otherwise it will carry on rusting under the pitched roof Regards from England
Beau is so darling!  She even sounds like her Mom!
And to think y’all do all this yourselves ….   Labor , editing & holding down a family ♥️♥️♥️♥️👋😁
Any chance you guys will be renting out the cabin?
Spencer needs some lite weight steel toe boots for safety
good word usage- corrugation
Happy New Year guys, hope you had some rest, great video, your building is coming along nicely 👍Cheers CB Australia 🇦🇺
🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴 I’m just curious 🧐, Did you guys ever do a video on placing the foundation footings for the container? Thank you 🙏, Carlos
I'll sure you will recheck all the weldings, as light gets through some of them.
Looking good!😊
In your last video I believed I saw some daylight on some of your welding seams ???
Everything is looking great 👍🏻
Boomin and Zoomin! Geesh, it's going faster than the last time. Beau, Whatcha doin DaDDY? LOL! The pond is really pretty now. Huggz all.
I'm so enjoying this. thank you. ❤️
Please like and subscribe    I think Spencer likes welding and fabrication
Are you going to finish welding all of the gaps around the window and door frames?
Spencer looks a home welding     . He will always have that trade. Measure twice cut once. 😜
I LOVE YOU BOTH ALWAYS  HAPPY NEW YEAR  KISSES FROM CALIFORNIA 🤭
I have watched them from the vary start of their channel . ,  It has been close to 4 years now ,more like three  i have learnde to love them
Am I the only one who feels sad when the music starts playing to let people know it’s the end of the episode?😢😂
Spencer the beard is looking good
I was thinkin' you guys should put the container "in place" before you install any windows. Then Spencer started saying that he was adding additional bracing. I'm assuming it is for the move. It will be neat to see where you guys decided to place it. And Kenz, I love what you said about Beau asking "whatcha doin'?" Very insightful. It all goes by in blink guys! So don't blink! LOL
Proud of you 2. Congrats on your beautiful family
Another job well done
We wait so much for your videos
Can't do daily vloging
hello how are doing? excellent work 👍
U GUYS ARE SO LUCKY, U FOUND EACH OTHER AND MAD 2 BEAUTIFUL KIDS, U BUILT A BEAUTIFUL HOME FOR URSELVES.....  I WISH MY LIFE WAS LIKE URS, LOVE WATCHING U 2 WORKING TOGETHER AND BANTERING BACK AND FORTH, MAY GOD BLESS U AND UR BEAUTIFUL FAMILY......
The babies 🙏🙏 🙏 are getting so big seems like Boh was just born
Watching from 🇺🇲
wow, "don't wish your life away", MacKenzie, 2023.  love the slow motion on the hot glove, been there, done that..  one of the top 10 video content, if not the top, thanks.. love the interaction between Beau and Spencer..
BEAU'S SOUNDS SO CUTE WHEN SHE'S TALKING - AND SHE IS COMPLETELY SERIOUS!
Spenser as usual is doing a great job. Beau was especially helpful in helping Daddy with the painting. She is such a treasure. See you next time. Oh, by the way, Spenser I hope you didn't burn yourself to badly that looked like you really felt that...
Love you guys, keep up the good work.. Lol with the hood on Spencer looks like a budget Bob Ross!!!
I enjoy everything you guys have done and sharing and making memories for a beautiful family. God bless your family
U know what is the most valuable gift u guys can give to ur kids?    It's these videos..❤️
Spencer is rocking his new hairdo...
I probably mist it but where is the new container for??
Just realize that someday those funny kids of yours will present you with grandkids and the fun really begins again. I love the background chatter.
Spencer, you are doing a great job, time-consuming work, made a bit quicker with the help from your daughter.  Love and best wishes to you all, from Mike. ❤
Hi Guy's,  You two always amaze me.  You always do things no matter what ,you away work past the bumps in the road .you laugh make fun just enjoy life as it comes . Yes Mackenzie you are absolutely right time just Flies past and you miss these time .But luckily you have these posts to Cherish.  I am also blown away by all the skills Spencer has learned on this Journey! You are the only people I have seen that do this all on your dime. And I am sure you are offered sponsorship deals.  you have created such a loving environment for your family  And we are so lucky to be able to come along for the Ride.   Thank you!! stay safe , Happy and laughing. 🇨🇦 Craig
Be sure to build a Storm bunker
Awwww she is daddy's  little helper, both your children are soooo adorable.
That coat hood made him look like a wild Neanderthal.
Beau helping her  Dad is nice to see..
Take care and be blessed.  Your little ones are so cute!
Jesus is coming soon.
Hello,      I love seeing your builds, but miss some of the personal videos that makes it seem like... friends?   How was your Christmas?  No video?  Can you maybe make 1 a week like the old days?  Please 🙏 😊
What are your plans for the cabin? Rent it, Bed N Breakfast, etc. Family? Curious.
❤❤❤
Awesome another video. I love watching you guys video. Looking good. Kiddos sure growing up. Have a great day!
It's an indication of the strength of your brand that you've kept viewers when "all" you've been doing for a few clips is designing the layout of a container and cutting holes in the sides.
Spencer, why do you use an angle grinder and not a saws all with metal cutting blade?  Aside from the spark showers that look great on camera I would think that saw blades would be more efficient and less expensive.     Wishing you and your family a blessed week, gentle weather and restful evenings.  Peace brother
Thanks guys for sharing the new episode !👍
Spencer looks tired.  I hope you both take some time during the week to relax.  The kiddos are getting big so fast❤️
Thanks guys  for sharing the new episode!! 👍👍
Happy new year! Blessings for the whole family.
Love ❤ your Channel 👍  From New Zealand 🇳🇿
6:20 This is why welding gloves are so oversized. Ouch
You guys need a mistake eraser for when an OOPS  happens.
when do you build container cabin in your backyard?
Good job guys. Stay safe and God bless
There is that sweet little girl I have been missing
How do we donate ? How you guys have jobs kids and still manage to entertain us is an amazing feat ! You turn these boxes into homes 🏡
Hello happy New years and and vidéo and projet love it tanks
How bout building yourself a work bench or table?  Ya like working with yur azz higher than your face??😂
"There is no substitute for hard work." - Thomas Edison  Your videos are shot so beautifully. Great job. Lots of hard work and raw determination to do things right.
New Camera?
I’m sure you get TONS of unsolicited advice, but as someone who has worked in optometry, I would suggest Spencer get his eyes checked. The amount of welding he does could have an impact on his vision. Just a thought because I care.
I forgot that I had the video speed set to 0.75 and Spencer sounded wasted.  Booze + Welding = no good
Mackenzie and Spenser are my Mum and Dad they abandon me in Florida at an Irish bar to go build a container home. Please help me locate them I hear they are in Texas somewhere. Save me Lil ol legs some walking please.
Take a sharpie and write it on the roof next to each thing measurements on each one to one
Oh look I'm the first 976 like....I'm amazing..😛
What your lady said is true my 2 are 50 plus and wont come till they have too and we need them . we are 78 and wife with  cancer and i have things i keep in myself. it hurts some time.
❤ great show  love beau
OUCH!  That hurt!  Just how hot does that welder thingy get?
7:22 That's some wild hair right there.
You will miss these days. Take it from an old man.
How many watts do you have on your solar panels  total.
Listening to Beau say, "Mom, mom, mom..." brings back memories of when my girls were little. My Wife one day wasn't having a great day at work and came home to this same barrage of, "Mom, mom, mom...." She just laughed and said, "I am changing my name from "Mom"!" Edit: Just wait for the "Why?" days. They will ask why for literally everything....even as to why the sky is blue....lol
I was a welder years ago. I had a friend almost amputated his finger. He was welding and a piece of molten slag hit his gold wedding band. Hospital had to cut off the rest of the band all the way to the bone. Most of my weider friends use those rubber wedding bands now.
Whats new guys? Good to see you again and happy new year to you and kids. Rochester NY Lilliam.
Yay! Was wondering bout y'all yesterday and found I was unsubbed after yrs of watching!
By the way, Spencer’s a beast
Are the otters still around?
The pond seems to have cleared up nicely 😊
Just coming up with cool things for the kids next you can build a play ground
Spencer, what if you did LED lights around the whole trees surrounded by the water colorful ones.   Yeah, what if you put a big piece of metal with your last name with LED lights so people can see who’s property  You know kinda like a address but it will be your last name Spencer can Weldon
You guys are being consistent with content agin that's exciting! I know you guys work hard and are incredibly busier with 2 kids. we just missed you guys these last 6 months or so.
Because I'm a pessimist and if things can go wrong... I'd weld and rivet Frankenstein stitches to the patch.
Lots of rain is good for the water 💧 tanks
Lovely family
I love y’all ! Can’t wait to see how this finishesss ❤
Ótimo dia 🏡🎋😊 linda família 😍👪
Way to many windows just my opinion
Who else loves these guys!?!?
Got to keep moving on to make more content! Lol
Yeah!! I love to see the notifications for Life Uncontained!! 😁
So glad you’ve taken on an additional build.  I feared losing you guys!
i am lucky number 5
👍
Love your videos,always so inspiring .
Well done
Love Your Videos Thank You Guys
Happy New Year!

Hi
