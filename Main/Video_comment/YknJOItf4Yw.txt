interesting watching the non-verbals of the security
what a great man. great fight!
I keep forgetting that Moreno can actually understand a lot of what Deiveson is saying because of the similarities between the Spanish and Portuguese languages.
Moreno is class what a gentleman
Almost a year ago, that’s crazy
Brandon’s definitely the people’s champ 💪
Only mcregor fans want hate and anguish
Kai kara France not moreno champion Peña not nunes champion
We just gotta ignore how dripped out David was
Amazing!
This didn't age well 😅
Podem falar p que for , mas essas 4 lutas entre moreno e deiverson vão ficar pra história. Todas lutas durissimas e técnicas.  Moreno foi superior em 3 ao meu ver , mas deiverson foi um lutador excelente também. Se deixasse de mão essa farsa e marra toda(que notavelmente não é  dele) talvez tivesse um melhor rendimento. Parabéns aos dois campeões!
He just whooped his a** again! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Brandon Moreno closes daveison series out .  Assassin baby wins the quatrilogy  🥊 left knuckle hook .  And new
Juiced brazzo lost this one, this was fight fixing.
That turned out a lot more positive than it could have. Love that they allowed him to enter the cage. 👊
To me there is no real or interim champ both these dudes are the champion of this division.
Watched Brandon on TUF when I was new to the sport. When DJ was champ Moreno was the guy I thought to dethrone him. I thought he was wrongly cut so I followed his career until this point. What a ride.
beautiful
I love the class by the 2 warriors
I’m Brazilian but I’m a big Brandon fan!!!!!!
I’m Brazilian but I’m a big Brandon fan!!!!!!
Unecessary belt. There is obviously gonna be a Figgy vs. Moreno 3. This is just an excuse to give Moreno a belt because he has a lot of fans.
This is such a cool rivalry. It's purely about the sport, not their egos.
The most respectful moment in ufc history
keep chandler out of the picture
Mexicans will go anywhere to support each other. Vegas or Brazil, we’ll be there.
Respect
common brandon w
Anyone here from joe Rogan?
Brandon will make history once again nd become double champion
Respect with these two champions
Class act. 🇲🇽 👏
Everyone forgets that Brandon failed a doping test for Clen.... Good old tainted meat excuse.
Can't tell the world how sick I really am of seeing betfred adverts everytime I click these videos.
It's his time! Why bother and promote future possible fight and while ruining, stealing this dude's show. Why ask stupid questions about some other guy and let him come to the octagon facing the guy who just fought and won a title. I thought it was very disrespectful towards Moreno.
Love how Figueiredo is a big old softie underneath the shades.
Puro Tijuana  viejo amos hay.
Moreno entendio el Ingles y el Portugues  facil y con la chueca ... trilingüe el compa y ahi les va el que entendio entendio desde la Morita pasando Por la Macro la 5y10 la revu zona rio y la Zona Norte sin olvidar a los de playas y la cacho Felicidades we amonoooos a festejar ! Saludos desde Chula Vista ahi les llevo taquitos del Jack cuando vaya a Tijuas chauuu
figgy and moreno are dope....cejudo save the division, but these guys make the division looks tough too....
Wtf is this guy saying
🇲🇽
Ultima pelea de kamarun husman
I didn’t think that was bad seen one of those mma shows talking about with some crazy click bait yea that was respectful
Es verdadero gladiador no necesita fantochear cómo muchos para llamar la atención.....genio y figura hasta la sepultura.
When Israel adesanya face reaction leak
What at g bro
Love this guy so much. I still remember when I saw him first time on the 24th season of ultimate fighter. Dude lost his first fight in it but I knew he would be great onedaym props to the champ. 🏆
Class.
ROUND 2 KAI COMES BACK TAKES THAT BELT
Moreno is such a class act. He’s honestly such a needed breath of fresh air.
What a cringe, why not hand Fuguirero a chair to smack him over the back with? Too much wrestle mania
Two skilled legends
Wtf is that bump on deivisons forehead dude?
This is what its suppose to be about...recognizing that life and sport are 2 separate things
“Let’s go, I don’t care I’m ready. Vamos pa Brazil.” That gave me chills
Dude's like moreno should be our elected leaders.
Everyone loves Brandon Moreno, he goes to show you don't have to be like connor mcgregor to become a superstar just Genuine.   But then again Colby Covington became a superstar after he created a character out of necessity of being cut from the UFC.  So I guess those are  two sides to differnt usable methods. You have to test out and see what works for you.
QUE BUENA MINIATURA SE VE BIEN!!
Joe got his Lex Friedman on
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow PERRO!!!
Fight with honor not hate... this might fight of the year! ✌🏼✌🏼
Who gives the left hand when they are giving you the right hand?
This is beautiful
Mexico moreno
When you know you can deliver a special and entertaining fight everytime, you don’t have to trash talk
That was cool.
🌟🔥BRANDON MORENO, ERES RESPETO, ADMIRACION Y EJEMPLO🔥👌💫 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn Brandon gave that foo a permanent lump on his head
*How Do You “Respect” The Guy When You Keep Giving Him Your Left Hand*
The truth
Televisa presenta
Can someone please lmk if there is a Mandela effect going on here or something like that because if you ask me I would say that they fought one time which they tied then they fought a second time when Moreno became champion then a 3rd time when figueiredo got his belt back? Or am I imagining n going crazy? Joe Rogan said fight for the 3rd time? Please someone tell me I’m not going crazy!!!!!!!!!
Like this Brandon guy tjoooo
I watched this like 10 times
Vamos pa brazil!!!
I want Moreno to be the champ! He so classy even a ignorant fool had to change up!
He’s the coolest dude in the UFC. Even while flustered he keeps it real! Real Champ
It’s going to be 4 fight joe
Let's fucking go, Brandon. Winning in Brazil will be much more sweeter. Let's do this shit.
🇲🇽
Siempre me haces llorar Brandon! Mil respetos!
Moreno might be the most likeable athlete in the world
Conor McGregor should Learn from this guy . Conor has kids but sometimes i feel they r more mature than him
that's called huevos
Damn. Humble kid.
i feel this sport is the most admirable/respectable sport and its always nice when u see real respect instead of cheeseball shit talk
Figueredo looking too big no wonder he is to powerful for the division
Viva mexico cabrones Brandon Llegó y será campion Undisputed the la UFC Viva Brandon viva Mexico.
Brothers in combat
I love this guy
Have watched this over 72 times now
moreno fucking rules.
Because god said so, we do the good thing from god.
Viva Mexico cabrones. Hay sol para todos culos
OMG what a champ, what great respect and honor that these two bring to the sport, I LOVE that shyte.
Loved that interaction between them!
Why that dude walk in there? Lmaooo
Brandon Moreno is the rol model that our kids need today, Thank you Champ, Eres grande y todo un orgullo para nosotros los Mexicanos !!!!
that sweater bro!!! Rawrrrrrrr!
You can tell how fig changes his attitude quick after Brandon won the crowd for being humble then fig tried to change his attitude by saying he ment no disrespect even tho he did by trying to ruin Moreno's moment.
Top class role model for his daughter
0 : 05 4:34 exactly the length of the video.
now thats a mans man much respect
CONGRATULATION THE NEW INTERIM UFC 277..GOOD LUCK MORENO
Every ufc event shows highlights but ufc doesnt, it generates so much views
Yeaah we want Coby in Brazil too 👀
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Classy gentleman 🔥
real fighter respect each other, cocky fighter talk trash will be rubbish forever.
Figerado is wrong for this one
Y have much more respect for such style of fighter that mc nugets trasch talk
I Love Those Guys !!!
Gotta love Brandon Moreno
A Unique but great Rivalry these 2 have, every division needs one of these
Bloody Wholesome
Finally, a fighter who acts like an actual martial artist
Hell yeah. It's how it's suppose to go. Nice
Not for nothing but Joe looks weird 😕
Moreno /Figueiredo 4 will be epic in Brazil.....
NATE DIAZ IF U ARE READING THIS PLZ GO SEE A CHIROPRACTIC

Tendi foi nada
didn't expect bryan adams is a good translator😁
Ídolo Moreno
He's such a good kid, and fighter.
Why did he say the new interim "lightweight" champion of the world of he is not in the lightweight division
This was epic. People expecting some WWE shit with all the booing but all you see is two great fighters respecting each other 🔥🔥  Oh and can we please give a shout out to the translator?! 💪
I fucking love this good sportsmanship this is how it should be

A love moreno n think the boy is gonna gave a great decade
Fig isn't a bad guy he just knows he has to be the villain of this story
There’s talk that fig was disrespectful but he was called out and he came out to the ring to Moreno…it’s called hype…but I think Moreno did enough to hold on to the belt the last fight. But on another note kai kara seen his only two losses he’s gonna get for a while he s a tough kid..but Moreno to mAny weapons in his arsenal.
I love this. Real men being real respectful. Fighters can be competitive and not take shots at one another. That’s the purpose of letting it all come out in the octagon
Fuck man Kai was gonna be 3 rounds up too
The honest and genuine respect between Moreno and Figueiredo is simply beautiful. Figueiredo doesn’t even try to rush Brandon to fight any earlier. How can’t you love this rivalry?
The most awkward post fight octagon interview I've ever seen
Kai Kara France should have his nickname be "Cobra" Kai Kara France..
Inspired scene 👍
Huge respect to bradon
WWE 🤦🤦🤦
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
What a way to shut up a negative crowd  Glad to witness this UFC today
Brandon is what the UFC needs. A true Champion
Boring Moreno was lucky...
Brenda morena um exemplo dentro da jaula diferente de Deivison Figueiredo está soberbo ... perdeu a humanidade já
may not today may not tomorrow but ill definitely be champion ohe day👏Stay humble brother
This is what a Top G sounds and acts like.
Brandon moreno is a good person.
Sukses dan jaya selalu for UFC....
Pero like
NOTHING BUT CLASS. You love to see it.
Respect each other fighter
Even better than the rose interview. The new GOAT moment in mma. Nobody can discount love.
Donde puedo enviar un mensaje personal para felicitar a este seňor Brandon Moreno
apple d ap in the house,,,,
Mis respetos para Brando tan humilde Que es.
These days UFC fighters seems more humble looks more like following the footsteps of Khabib 😊
555 54in
Viva La  Mexicooooooo 🇲🇽
I ain’t humble😎
MORENO IS A CLASS ACT THRU AND THRU
he beat kaikara to fight figuereido again....just imagine that in the fourth fight they tie again...we would need a fifth fight🤣🤣
Deiveson Figuiredo needs to move up in weight.  He is way overweight for his division, I don't think he wants to cut that much weight.
Glad he was humbled. His last fight was trashy and he was a huge showboat 😂 taunting and talking all this shit for him to lose his belt. You’re damn right he fell off his high horse. Glad his attitude switched up for this fight. Good comeback.
There’s absolutely no way that this rivalry doesn’t go into the Hall of Fame after these two retire. 3 stellar fights (so far). Two equal and dominant skillsets. Brandon Moreno - Last pick on TUF, eliminated first, cut from the company, first ever Mexican-born UFC champ. First quadrilogy in UFC history. Resurrecting a dying division.
Why did he get the interim belt, what’s up with Figgy?
Yes siiir we going to Brazil
I really like Brandon. Feisty but still very respectful. I hope he stays healthy and fight for the legit belt not the interim one.
The humbleness he presents him self with is un matched Brandon you are an example for everyone to follow man. Blessings and congratulations carnal !!
Gave him the left hand…. Disrespectful
353 55 y 35y 35y
deiveson  no sabe perder le dieran  la última peleó por unánime decisión, fue por lástima porque unos días antes de la peleó estaba llorando y diciendo que odiaba a brandao el hombre que lo avía horcado y humillado, Brandon es un ejemplo si odio sin miedo sin límites arriba Brandon eres el mejor de mejores campeon y arrive Mexico cabrones ….
Cringey af at least make the fourth fight interesting
Crazy how we all have the same visceral reaction to hearing Portuguese. What is it about it that makes it so harsh on the ears? Or am I just unknowingly racist against Brazilians? I'm Spanish BTW.
Brandon your the best word champion !!!
6646in 6in
too much mafia ....thrash all this with bodyguards.
These two are the best I am living this rivalry from UK still pissed off ufc  took my sub off
Wtf happened to my subscription I've been subbed forever and you took me off fuming mate
The woman in white in the background is fine!!!!!
Beautiful
The Best
"I will be champion one-day"
Brandon is the new Lion 🦁 Heart 💪
Viva Mexico Cabrones 💯🔥🇲🇽
This is not the WWE bro. Let Moreno have his moment. This looks so wack.
I love Moreno but who does his tattoos?!
Classy both figthers.  It's how practioners should be inside and outside the octagon.
Now that was a class act from Moreno and of course also from Figuerero, allthough he was ready for some trash talk at the beginning. These moments do it for me, I know MMA is a sport but for me it will always be martial Arts 🥋 respect Osssss 🙌🏼
They fought in mexico ??
Great sportsmanship
Top
Totally disrespectful
Most loveable killer ever
Davidson vs Brandon Again in Brazil 🇧🇷 LETS GO!!!!!
He’s too nice it’s lowkey lame
El orgullo de TJ 🇲🇽
That hit me hard when they made peace like that. So many great men are held back by their own bitterness and anger these days. It's so good to see people squash their pride and respect one another.
This is the perfect hero and bad guy fight
4th time, not 3rd
What a gentlemen  now thats the people champ
way to crash a post fight interview.....  props to Brandon for handling like a professional.
Hard not to be a fan of Brandon. I think he and Figueirdo realize their careers will be forever intertwined as they are the only fighters that can beat each other. They are each others Rocky and Apollo so to speak.
That was classy. Lol
I hate this WWE crap. UFC should have never allowed him in the cage. Shameful!
this is one of the greatest rivalries of all time
Davidson looking a little thick and chubby in the faceeee
Respect brothers. Respect
Haven’t seen class like this since GSP
Brandon is the next GOAT!
RESPECT!!!
Nice to see a smart kid for a change,  need more like him too many hotheads
Favourite WWE moment in UFC
Divisi fly wight is the best moreno and feguiredo top
O Moreno é muito bom. Mas acredito que, o Figueiredo ganhará essa luta aqui no Brasil. Mas o Moreno merece também, é muito humilde.
The only time this would be okay is if the fighter from outside the ring and the winner inside the ring sorted this out prior to the fight and agreed to do this. Otherwise, Figueiredo is jumping into Brandon’s spotlight at the pinnacle of six months of Moreno’s life.
Grace in victory or defeat is the most bad-ass thing a person can do
What an awkward handshake😬
Davidson should not have been allowed in the ring. Disrespect to the new champion. Full respect to the new champion. Let him have his deserved time
Is that Izzy’s lil brother next to Figueredo lmao
Moreno is a grown ass mf! Respect🙇
Moreno is a grown ass mf! Respect🙇
Salute And Respect 🙏....
A third time? Isnt it the 4th?? 🙄
Shake right hand. Thats a rule. Moreno did it right. Twice. Respect for moreno
Deym this almost makes a grown man cry! Peak respect and sportsmanship!
Lost respect for moreno here where is the promo
The translator is the one suffering from all this lol 😂
What happens when you anger a brain surgeon?      They will give you a piece of your mind.

Very few times we get to witness so much class and respect in sports.
🔥
He acknowledged the Champion instead of talking trash, that's a classic act of a champion right there. Viva Mexico, go and unify that belt to be the undisputed champ once more.
Kia ora Mexico yous have true champion
Yair is awesome cheerleader
Vamos a Brasil 🇧🇷 amigos 🇲🇽
This is brutal to listen through. Quit letting them speak.
Chael keeps saying this is awkward or weird. This was a great moment
WWE
Figueiredo came in ready to posture and be a tough guy, because he was expecting Moreno to do that too. Moreno changed Deiveson's actions with his own kindness. There's a lesson in that
Much respect to Brandon!
Moreno v figueiredo is the real life naruto v sasuke
Ahuevo Brandon yo lo sabía que ibas a ganar 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Uff 🇲🇽🇲🇽
1:53 _Deiveson Invading The OCTAGON With A Fighter That He Already fought With it!!  щ(゜ロ゜щ)_ _This NEVER Happened In the UFC HISTORY...._  2:22 _Deiveson In the OCTAGON, Right In the face of Moreno With the Belt Carrying On his SHOULDERS..._ _щ(゜ロ゜щ)_
Manly shit right there
Two fighters showing class and sportsmanship.
Idk why Dana said this was disrespectful it just hyped up the fight that much more these gentleman are in the promoting and making money business. Loves the respect between the two IMO Brandon won the last fight between them but so excited for the 4th
Real gangster
5y7  5 5
Figueroa     entrance  into octagon  brought WWF vibes
🇧🇷💪🏽🇲🇽 hermanos en todo los mejores 🔥😎
Class act. I have a feeling this rivalry will go down as 1 of the greatest ever when it's all said and done. What a way to close out 2022
Breno Moreno é o verdadeiro campeão, não esse arrogante aí! As vaias é pq tu é chato maluco.
My time and money would be well spent to see these two champions...yours very truly Alfonso Cantu USMC

VERY RARE QUADRULOGY IN MMA THIS MIGHT BE THE FIRST TIME IM NOT QUITE SURE BUT I TRULY BELIEVE THIS IS UNDERRATED AND I HOPE PEOPLE WOULD MAKE THIS HUGE. QUADRULOGY HAPPENS WHEN TWO FIGHTERS ARE NECK AND NECK AGAINST EACH OTHER,PLUS THEY BOTH SCORED 1WIN 1 LOSE 1 DRAW OVER THE OTHER
2 future HOFs and UFC biggest rivals. This moment will go down in history
See not all mexican's and brazilians are crazy !   Humble as fuck both of themm🤩🤩🤩
The only time joe doesn't look like a little man Is next to a flyweight 🙄
Wow😧
I love this sport
Arriba Mexico ! A la verga el resto !
"Yee Wife is in me DMs"
That segment with Davidson was just heart warming ... He wants to set and example and be a good person and even Davidson acknowledged that .. this sport respect triumphs all
Brandon Moreno el mejor. Es amable y humilde
Total class by Moreno and Figueredo. These 2 are head & shoulders above the rest of the divisionl …  They just need to fight every 3-4 PPV’s. Like Dana said,, this rivalry will NEVER get old.. its the exception to the rule.
Why is Dana white so biased? After Brandon Moreno lost his belt they should’ve gave him a rematch immediately after just like they gave figueiredo when he lost his belt, instead they made Moreno fight someone else to prove it, and in the first and second Moreno and figueiredo match Moreno mostly dominated him so I feel he really needed to prove himself before they gave him his rematch
I beleive this is THE best post fight interview especially with their past
The people's champ!
These are the two best in the world at 125 flyweight with huge respect bros lovem both this is true rivals
Todos sabemos que Brandon Moreno es el verdadero campeón del mundo figueredo es un charlatán solo por ser amigo  de Dana white le dieron el campeonato del mundo pero todos sabemos que las tres veces Brandon Moreno le puso una putisa
Does Joe Rogan not pay attention to how many times they fought? They already fought 3 times. He needed to ask if he wants to fight fig for a 4th time
Didn’t nobody notice that Joe Rogan said do you want to fight him for the third time didn’t he mean for the fourth time
Why did Joe Rogan say for the 3rd time doesn’t he mean the 4th fight against fig?
Great class!
Congrats 👏🏼  Figueiredo will remain Champion in the 4th fight though.. 🏆😎
moreno cool fight
These are true athletes
Wow Moreno almost made me weep when he said: I forgive you plz forgive me, but don't be confused, i wanna fight, let's fight. Then he gave him his hand. What a class act.
Very nice video!
I keep hearing people say this was cringe but I thought this was awesome.
Seeing this is like seeing an amazing journey, I started training mma before covid and fell in love with it specially in my hometown which where brandon moreno is from Tijuana, lockdown came I couldnt train i was so desperate and did what I learned from home then went to washington to work for a long time, I got to see brandon moreno fight davidson and that fight was badass, my cousins where doubting him but I was rooting for moreno deep in my heart, then the 2nd fight came, we all know how that went, I jumped all over the place while my cousins where in schock, finally I came back to Tijuana to train mma again but this time at entram, got to learn new things it was so fun, the best gym, then I met the legend himself took a pic and the following days I would see him very often, my friends that I made there invited me to see his title defense at a bar, we were all screaming, when he lost we were all sad but still support him, now he came with this win and seeing this 2 face to face about to make the first 4th fight, makes me look back at this almost 2 year journey of brandon moreno being the character he is which a lot of people in Tijuana my age and myself can relate to gives me goosbumps
I love this dude
Dave Blackamote 145 uncrowned champ next to Deiveson
They shouldnt have allowed Figueiredo in  the Octagon, he completely took this moment away from Brandon...
Less go ❗🇲🇽
This gave me 1000x more goosebumps than the punk McGregor style bullshit. This is real leadership in life
Love you Moreno!! Best dude ever
Brandon is de man!
Class that chalk legs Conor will never have.
Great brawl
What a guy
Already selling the PPV! Saga comes to a close.
That’s going to be a sick fight!
MedMen stock Moving up now! Set your Family up for Life. Marijuana about to be legalized. Buy MedMen stock today! MMNFF
So what belt does figero has?
I'm relieved it went well. But I wasn't a big fan of them having Deiveson come into the Octagon tho. I agree w Dana. Moreno fought his butt off and this was his moment and he has another guy in his face while he's talking. I feel like this was spontaneous to be fair. But I would prefer they didn't do stuff like that. Still really glad it went well
Shit getting real wwe
Big man knows he ain't gonna win he showed a huge sign of weakness by coming inside on his day off
🇲🇽❤️‍🔥
Good sportsmanship makes an already glorious sport all the more glorious.
Am I the only one who occasionally gets a "cute little kid" vibe from Figgy? XD I mean I know he's a full grown man who's also a trained killer but I can't help it sometimes lol. Especially the times when he tries to act like a heel when you know he's the opposite.
The fact that he is man enough to be forgiving and be the first to initiate that is great! So many people have trouble doing that and being genuine. He really is my favorite MMA fighter right now.
0:53 that kick really is so beautiful!
He’s a great human being and this makes me so happy to see
WORLD....Take note!!
This is why Brandon Moreno is a star. Beautiful show of respect and humbleness. 💯
What did Rogan saying? I think it's their 4th time fight soon ..
The most beautiful post fight ever
nosé que tienen los brasileños que no quieren aprender inglés jajajajaja
Deivson will Knock him out Cold 🥶 in the 4th fight then move up in weight and claim that bantamweight belt
The God Of War LOOKS HUUGEE 🔥😤😤👊👊
People are going to give Brandon shit because he’s not selling fights by saying bull shit like Izzy but he’s way more entertaining than Izzy
The fact that Joe Rogan says Davieson and him fight for a 3rd time :O
Beautiful
Why would was it rude . He got he’s chance again the champ gave him another champ 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Figgy eat him
What a legend !
Damn I want this fight in December damn damn damn
How can u not love Moreno.
Viva mexico kabrones !!
Viva la Mexico from Ukraine 🇺🇦
Such a humble guy Brandon ❤️ I remember the day when u said "Not today, not tomorrow but one day I'll be the champion"  Alhamdulillah Allah fulfilled your dream brother ❤️
Idk why that made me emotional. Brandon Moreno is the man! He will win in December.
I don't get why people said it was weird or disrespectful. Moreno asked where Davison was in the audience, so of course, he would come into the Octagon. And when they met, both handled it great. No fake animosity, just good competitive sportsmanship on both sides respecting the skills of the opponent and agreeing to fight again as it's not yet clear who the better fighter is. No WWE drama there, just competitive mindsets. And we all know their next fight will be fire. No need for fake drama.
That guy is the BEST Brazilian translator in my opinion.
Dana said this came off as disrespectful? Moreno called him in the octagon and then they gave eachother props . Now lesnar and DC that was disrespectful on both ends lol
Brandon is easily one of my favorite guys
Class
What a fight this will be ✌️
This is called CLASS! Congratulations guys! You both did  awesome but more importantly your respect for each other is what makes all of us who train a wonderful thing!
Respect Figi not aggressive just promote respect
Can't wait for their 3rd fight according to Joe Rogan 🤡
Beautiful display of respect..
Joe just wants a cigar and some whiskey lol
D
5y57 55
Grandeeee moreno
Is two faczz? Dana and offshore bet?
Sí señor 💪
You makes me proud to be Mexican! I’ll raise my kids the same brother
Champion or not... the sweater DF is wearing WTF
Respect
Haha I love it...he said don't get it twisted though my G we can throw the fuckin hands
Lol Brando Moreno can't sell fights
He's obviously over the cejudo  beef
Disrespectful, let this guy have his moment!
I don't know why the media was saying Figgy was rude. Brandon basically called him up there and they had a respectful talk and promoted their fight.  In Brazil is a nice touch.
goated moment, one love and respect amongst warriors there that night
What a great moment of sportsmanship
Brandon Moreno，the assasin baby is a true champion, a fighter and an good father.
Bruce messing up is my favorite part of ppvs
Mclovin does it again!
I'm Brazilian and I want Brandon to win
Brandon "dAtTeBaYo" Moreno. Figueiredo went up to Moreno like he wanted all that smoke but Moreno pulled a 'Talk no Jutsu' lmao🤣🤣
All that love is cool but the fans want to see a war!
True Champions both of them (Inspirational)
HUMILITY!!! the humility of this guy is highly admirable
Speak english
Remember when people said fly weight was dead?🤣🤣
No class should of let him have his moment. Simple as that
I hope dana white disperse Flyweight division because the same face fight... So boring!!! For the One Two three four five  all face the same apponent
Two best flyweights on the planet in the cage by the end
I think that the UFC should re-implement the absolute division bare knuckle . find out who the best P4P is .
Beautiful
Both of these guys have so much respect for each other
Respect to Kai too. Warrior. Him and Brandon are all class
I love Brandon. Such a light being, no one is perfect but what an amazing human he is
For a third time😩😩joe my boy cmon man
This was legendary.
Wholesome moment
2:10 Is that vin diesel?
I thought this was gonna turn nasty when Davison walked in but I'm so happy it turned into something positive instead. Legendary gentlemen. Thank you.
If more of us were like Moreno and Davidson the world would be a better place!
Moreno is a long time friend of my family. We party and spar all the time. We are planning to start setting up academy's out on ajuascalientes, michocan, Sinaloa. There are some tough ass fuckers in Mexico. In the next 10 years Mexicans will rule the sport
If Kratos was a Goblin.
About to go at it for a 4th time? Give the flyweights a main event, dammit!!!
Damm he s getting better
Brandon and Figgy knows how to hype a fight man... Figgy tries so hard to be the villain... But he's also just a cool ass dude
They literally saved the division
Figgy didn't understand anything Moreno said anyway...
Man i feel bad for figgy, the ufc wants him to be the villain so bad, but he is such a good guy from what i can see
Emejing post fight!!!! Full respect
GAK BISA BAHASA ENGGRESSSSSS 😁😜
VIVA MEXICO PUTOS
Brandon Moreno is a gentleman and a fine example indeed.
No class - should of stayed in his seat
cringe
Is this the WWE?? Lol
Anxiety must go. It must be replaced by faith and solemn confidence in the outworking of the divine plan. Attention is key; for where man’s attention goes, there goes his energy, and he himself can only follow. When you go to bed tonight and lay your head on your pillow, go deep inside and find the light that is there, dwell in that profound peace. There, you shall find all of heaven.
Gotta give it up to my cousin Brandon moreno!!
That’s class simple as that
I think people should stop booying Figueiredo cause i believe that kid was forced from his manager or team to act like that but when he is face to face with Moreno he always showed him respect, hug him and raised his arm. Their rivalty is one of a kind and we have to thank botj of them if we can appreciate such a high level of combat sport, inside and outside the cage.
DOPE 🔥 U CAN HAVE MY BABY MAMA IF I HAVEN’T THE HARDEST MUSIC OUT NOW NO 🧢
Brandon Moreno for president! I still don't think Figueiredo should have entered the octagon, not only was it a little too WWE, but let the guy have his night. Imo Figueiredo is the opposite of humble.
Ese viejo Brandon Moreno se merece todo en esta vida... Nomás por la chulada de persona que es...
Viva MEXICO CABRONES !!🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Great sportsmanship from both 💪🏼 !!
Brandon’s cool man! Figuero too for showing respect cool dudes!
Awkward
Great sportsmanship.
He really did attack like a freakin assassin
This is what's up. Never gets old seeing sportsmanship and class amongst elite fighters. UFC needs more of this, and we've been seeing it more frequently lately. Legendary Octagon interview right here.
What is a tornado's favorite game to play?      Twister!
I wish more professional MMA fighters would show more worldclass respect to each other like these two professional Champions!  Such Class these two represent... 🙏🏽😎👍🏽
brandon moreno 1er
Get your belt back my brother!!!!!! Don’t let that dude try to intimidate you he knows what he’s in for that third fight you will win my brother you will win…
much respect to him
Respect
What a clown lol
This is giving me the most St-Pierre vibes I’ve ever had from another person lmao
Moreno is a beast in octagon
Repent to Jesus Christ “Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen.” ‭‭Ephesians‬ ‭3:20-21‬ ‭NIV‬‬ ht
Sucks for Kai. He was arguably winning the fight until that kick.
im glad theyre taking fighters that can at least have conversations
so much repect. you cant love those guys
The new and most relevant Rivalry in the UFC💯  Moreno is the Man no question.  Both fighters deserve respect
What a great person Moreno is my full respect carnal viva Mexico!!!!!
I don't think Davidson will make weight. He looks pretty heavy in that red shirt
Them Brazilians love that home court steroid advantage haha that hired wada is a fucking joke in Brazil expect a insanely looking champ for this one bros. I still hope this beast Spanish man wins.
One day this rivalry will go into the hall of fame and this moment will be one of the best parts of it.
Morena & KaraFrance both such awesome fighters. Brilliant fight
We absolutely love you Moreno ❤️❤️❤️ and your ok to Davison ❤️ remember how gracious Davison was when he lost to Moreno picking him up and showing him off to the crowd! These guys can fight every Sunday lmfao, but seriously so classy, so decent and so well said by Moreno, it ain't just Mexicans who luv ya baby❤️✌️
Hey guys I just wanted to let you know Jesus Christ died for our sins and he’s coming back soon. He  loves you so much and will give you eternal life with Him if you believe in Him, repent of your sins and follow him! God thinks about you 24/7 and is waiting for you to come home! Turn away from this world and turn to God! The LORD wants you!!
That was a powerful moment in many ways. God Bless Brandon M and DF.
That's going to be a real good fight.
This shit is turning more and more like WWE e’ryday
Brandon Moreno es el ejemplo de que dentro de la jaula es una bestia, pero terminada la pelea es un caballero. De eso se trata el deporte.
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."     -John 3:16 God gave us his only son Jesus Christ who Lived a sinless Life then died on the cross to endure our punishment, he rose again on the 3rd day and is currently seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty.   We have all sinned against the Perfect and Holy God that gave us Life, we all deserve the Punishment of Hell for our sin/rebellion against him.  We have all Broken the Moral Law in our Hearts, even if you don't believe in Jesus, or have never heard of him or the Law of Moses or the Bible, you are still sinful and on your way to Hell. But the GOOD News is that Jesus Christ took our sin upon himself by being Crucified and shed his Blood as payment for our Sins.   He took our Punishment and gave us his reward of Eternal Life in Heaven  Jesus is returning to Judge the world soon my Friends Please Repent and believe in his sacrifice and Love for you, believe in him as your Lord and Saviour, and you shall be saved.   May God Bless you all!
Moreno make me proud to be Mexican n I’m a light skin 😭
Kai Kara-Ustralia
Congaguletions bredon

Total stud. 🙌🏼
What the fuck was that???   DISSIN MORENO LIKE THAT, BRINGING TO THE RING FIGUREDO ???? DOUCH MOVE !!!!!!!!!!!
Hell Yeah Brotherz!!! RESPECT!!! Something ALL THOSE BOOING "FANS" DON'T HAVE A CLUE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO THRO DOWN SO.........F"CK'M!!! Can't Wait 4The 3rd & FINAL BLOWS From THESE 2 WARRIORS!!! THNXU 2ALL!!! 💯❤️🤙😶✌️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
all that said that Kai Kara France will win look now who won the assassin baby and the rival of the champion and I hope he will beat the champion a 2nd time
If they fight in Brazil the PPV will $hut down from all the purchases!!!🤑 the world wants this!💪😎
What nice guys ! They respect each other without blaming and talking bullshit. These are real sportsmen.
This has been the same 3 dudes just beating the shot out of each other over and over lol.
Expected a WWE bs moment, got an classy moment like this, awesome!
Pure class and respect. This is why we love this sport!
This was great don’t know why Dana got upset this is what help sell fights It’s entertaining just like one Brock stepped in the ring of DC it’s entertaining
You could tell figgy was trying to get into morenos head and get him pissed but Moreno shut it down and was friendly and said I respect you and don’t hate you
VAMOS BRANDO💪🏼😎
Hey props to Figi too man he accepted, shook his hand, and patted him on the back. He dropped the act real fast instead keeping it going. 👍
Gracias BRANDON por dar BIEN de que hablar QUE BUENO QUE NO PIERDAS TUS VALORES Y EL RESPETO AL SER HUMANO, ERES GRANDE Y UN BUEN EJEMPLO PARA TU HIJA MIJO!
Good sportsmanship at the end. Shit was classless at first.
346  4 46
The rare Bruce Buffer mess up.
Excelente ser humano brandon , recuerdo verte pelear por primera vez y desde entonces te sigo eres un tremendo guerrero pero sobre todo tremendo ser humano desde Republica dominicana esperamos con ansias verte en el octageno nuevamente
Becoming a champion in any form is so hard in the UFC. Wish they would have allowed Moreno to have his moment without figueiredo in his face. I don't know, just felt wrong
He shook his hand with the left hand. That's not respect. Brandon is a stand up man.
🇲🇽 🥚
What a class act.
Excellent moreno put his family 1st specially his daughter.
This is a real man, punch and kicks is gonna talk
Why WAS THIS INTERIM TITLE FIGHT SHAMELESS
Legit respect between these two guys. That was the classiest fight call out I've ever seen.
I thought Figgy was going to insult him in someway but he really had it out for the crowd 😂💀
i love the sportsmanship in ufc always waiting for it to happen
All class by Moreno. Good for him and great for the UFC
I don't care if that's a Gucci sweater, it's the dumbest thing I've. It's the ugly Christmas sweater version
Moreno is the pride of Mexico. El Pueblo te Sigue Moreno , parteselas a todos!! Am I the only who thinks is disrespectful to bring another champion into his ring?
This was hilarious lol
Brandon is a humble warrior, have mad respect to him and fighters like Charles Olivera. These dudes have nothing but respect for the fight game, and their character shows after big wins like this him being able to look at Davidson in the eye and say what he did. Excellent example of a humble beast

I was not impressed with your performance
Bulletin they let Fig. in the octagon.  Can't the winner have a minute to enjoy the win he worked for? Ref or officials should be fired.
Let's go Brandon
NEED the 4th fight for the tiebreaker. It's literally 1-1-1. Guna be LEGENDARY. Each fight has been classics so far.
Love those 2 dudes man! Have hearts of gold the both of em! Can't wait for this saga to continue
Legendary stuff! I enjoyed every bit of it
Figgy has no f***ing idea what is being said 😂😂😂
We’re not going to talk about how Daveison stole his interview…
You always need that rival to bring out your best
As the old saying goe's "LIVER OR LET DIE"
😂😂😂😂
Moreno el verdadero CAMPEON dentro y fuera del octagono, felicidades desde Chile bro, y en diciembre vamos por el titulo INDISCUTIDO !!!!!! VIVA MEXICO CABRONES,, QUE VIVA LA RAZA !!!!  🇲🇽 🇨🇱
I fucking loved this. Both guys are pure class and the 4th fight is going to be insane.  Wish the UFC would do stuff like this more often, start building up the next fights immediately and have the champion come into the octagon. Really cool to see
1-1-1 we all knew this was coming I got the assassin baby winning his title back 🤷🏻‍♂️
That was beautiful to see
I was waiting at the end when Moreno turn his back, Figueiredo will hit him with his belt and then he will star kicking him in the head like Ric Flair. But that didn't happen :(
Moreno is octane from apex 😂
Respect
Great fighter but better human being. Cheers.
Hope Moreno beats Figueiredo. Guy is a true gentleman and great human being
Fuck yeah 🤣😎
I'll spend $$$ on this fight
Moreno single-handedly keeping Flyweight alive
vamos a brasil,!!  viva mexico cabrones
Remember kids, be polite before you beat the shit out of someone. Let's be good examples to each other. This isn't golf you bitches
Damn that's huge respect
All respect to Brandon !
Lets all say a prayer for the nasty gash on Penas head yikes ! Well, guess I was wrong. Thought it would be close with Pena for the win. Good fight. Can we be real for a sec? Both of those brawly broads scare the shit outta me. Bet they both wear the strap on. Never take it only Give. When they in bed about to make love they make the MK Scorpion voice "Get OVER HERE !!!!"  Right before they finish their sexual opponent off.  then you hear " Finish Him/her...Nunes Wins!!! Fatality!!! Flawless Victory....Toasty!"  Lmao 🤣
Glad to see the translator goat back
I didn't like this. He just won the title, it was his moment and they shouldn't have let Figueiredo come in the cage like that. Fortunately, Moreno had the character to turn a bad situation into a good one, and in the end, Figueiredo rose to the occasion.
I’ll tune in to this fight !
🇲🇽💯🔥🙏🤎
F......... Figurito for entering the octagon and attempting to steal BRANDON'S lime light. UFC officials should have never opened cage. Brandon wanted to smack him but his family values would not allow him. Honorable ! Will be a great champion again.
Real man mentality
Figueiredo should have never been allowed into the ring.  It was not his time, it was Moreno's time.  Someone dropped the ball at the gate.

This is some wwe shit here. Figgy went up to moreno like a Chavo and Eddie guerrero segment
Freaking awesome
Straight up the most beautiful thing i seen in the octagon.. forgiving and asking for forgiveness.. no K.O. can beat that.. true warriors!!!

Both guys are top notch athletes

F that sportsmanship bs! Tell him you fd his mother!
Respeito acima de tudo ❤️❤️ Dois guerreiros e merecem tudo que estão colhendo.
Brandon "Giga Kick" Moreno
Beautiful
DONT KNOW HOW THIS POST FIGHT ISNT GETTING MORE RECOGNITION. THAT WAS SOME REAL CHAMPION SHIT. BETWEEN 2 WARRIORS THAT HAVE EARNED LEGIT RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER THROUGH BLOOD AND BATTLE IN ITS PUREST FORM
Should’ve never let figgy in the octagon
That is a "I'm not impressed with your performance" level call out
twse rereryyer e
Joe means 4th time not 3rd time, what an idiot, trt making him slower
Moreno did not look 5ft 7 if Kai was 5ft 4, suspect heights
I hope moreno gets knocked out bad no fight promotion skills
These guys are going to be best friends for life
Act of class sportsmanship and respect. Both of them are great latin fighters and representatives of their great nations of Mexico and Brazil
This man is a humble one ..rare in ufc..keep up bro. You're such a great man, continue to be an example to all ufc athlete..humble and sportsman.
That started really salty, but ended real sweet.
Respect !
Es un gran tipo Brandon Moreno ojalá llegué muy alto y pueda vencer a Figueredo.
brandon moreno autentico guerrero azteca tigre arriba mexicooooooooooooo
Figgy was looking to start a commotion until brandon said the nicest things
One of the most cordial faceoffs ever. I like both these guys
Really appreciate this kid.
VIVA MEXICO CABRONES!!!!! GREAT FIGHT FOR FANS AND MMA
pure class in that ring
Oh shhhiiiiii
The championship Moreno just won was it a vacant belt? If so who had it before?
Moreno in a parallel world: PuSh mE Now, Push mE NoW
Dice vamos a Brasil,aunque se haga en Brasil ese estadio va a explotar de mexicanos

Very classy and respectful. I love the no trash talk. 👌🏾
Class act. Much respect

Figgy gave him the left smh
Viva tijuas cabrones
The first ever quadrilogy in the ufc
Moreno es un verdadero guerrero Azteca, este si que representa el coraje Mexicano! Soy Peruano pero respeto mucho y tengo de idolos a Julio Cesar Chavez, Erik el terrible morales, Juan Manuel Marquez, Marco Antonio Barrera y otros. Que viva Mexico cabrones!
classy
After joining  Chute boxe, figgy been very respectful. Charles and Dheigo lead great examples and expectations
Bro wtf was with Figureido coming in there
VAMOS A BRAZIL WEY A HUEVO 🇲🇽
class act
Brandon Moreno merecido Campeón  SUERTE Y VIVA 🇲🇽
Beautiful champion
we all know Figgy was looking for all the smoke but had to take the nice guy route because of moreno
How can you hate on this man
Moreno much more than fan fighter, he's got serious heart! Huge respect mate
wow Brandon Moreno! great message
Lets go Brandon!
These guys're making history...
The WWE is lit!
If there is not bad blood between two fighters the will boring as fuck
I hated that shit !! Like a bad WWE . Brandon deserved better.
That's beautiful martial arts of the mind
Figueredo was gonna talk shit before he realized he would get booed and look corny so he acted all respectful and said his respects
Moreno is a class act ❤️
What a great example Brandon!
Moreno makes me forget I'm a gringo
Figgy looks like the maharajah of Calcutta, something straight out of Bollywood
W translator
Probably the best Post fight interview I’ve ever seen
He changed his tune when David came in
David just made more people dislike him
Damn, I wasn't a fan but morenos so nice and good hearted
Let's go to Brazil.
That was one of the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Fight is not happening this year and maybe not ever ifthey dont put it in Brazil. That is what figgy wants if thewy offer the fight in vegas this year he doesnt want that. Dude just wants to fight for the belt at home.
Very classy interview,  real men who were raised correctly.
This two is amazing
Cant think of a fight i wouldnt want to see more then that 4th one. Its not like they have a choice
Moreno has it all and class just like GSP. Great for the sport of MMA!
It’s always a relief when the Brazilian translator is this guy, I trust him to deliver the lines perfectly
🥹🙌🏽👏🏽 Grandes! 👏🏽
Wait, why was this for interm belt? The UFC is going insane with this stuff.
How can you not respect each other after the wars they've been through together.  Wasn't expecting to see that tho.  Respect to both men!
I see Moreno getting in the Hall Of Fame in the future!
Class act
figueiredo will win again
When you at the highest level fighting competition, that's why you must to learning English.
Both fighters just want to fight the best with no excuses. That’s what I love to see. I love how the champion steps in the ring after and they both agree to fight. I wish this happened more often
This was painful watching like UNCLE CHAEL SAID
Moreno is so good, France is a monster and he put him away with a nasty body shot.
Deiveson was trying to sell the fight the WWE way, but Brandon showed the true sportsmanship of a real fighter and athlete. HESPECT
Moreno.  This man sets a precedent for humanity.  Goddamn.
Hopefully clowns like Connor like Colby like sterling and few more learn from Brandon how to be a champion
My man !
Viva Mexico!! 🇲🇽
Magic
it looks like Deiveson and Moreno are destiny to do this forever
This is for sure going down as one of the biggest rivalries in MMA
🔥🔥 LFG another banger fight loading
Looks like Joe ran out of questions to ask
Please ufc do more standoff like this more often
Wow Moreno almost made me weep when he said: I forgive you plz forgive me, but don't be confused, i wanna fight, let's fight. Then he gave him his hand. What a class act.
Nice to see Figuereido change his tune. Much respect to both fighters for setting an example for the world to see.
Joe rogan has joined the Mormons!
Love that guy!!!!!
Fucked up thay took Brandon time away from him thats his night.  Turn around an have to have figgy in his face wtf ufc??
Well deserved
**Beef squashed**  🙌💯
Super happy for Brandon. Just wanna say something real quick, Brandon did not win that third fight against Figgy. Figueiredo won that fight according to the rules of mma and people just can’t accept it because they like Moreno and don’t like Figgy. He lost that fight and thinking otherwise is really stupid. If you think Moreno won, think to yourself why you think he won and you’ll likely find your opinion rooted in bias. Just wanted to say that because the slander towards Figgy is unfair. They’re both great fighters who have one legitimate win over the other. I can’t wait to see the 4th fight and I hope both fighters get the respect they deserve
Yo
Iron ROCCO Adam Cohen Stallion
Brandon won the third match. Pr atleast a draw and leave the belt to the champ
Brandon felicidades campeón  Pura humildad este vato 🔥💪🏽
Stand up Assassin 👏🏼👏🏼
Tf? They never fought in his home lol figgy said he’d fight in Mexico and backed out on that lmao
He’s legit!
Moreno speaks the same language didn't he?
Let’s give it up to that translator as well!
Dana was right about letting Figgy come in during Moreno’s post-fight speech coming off as disrespectful. They should’ve waited til he was done talking. Can’t wait for the 4th fight. Moreno is such a damn lovable guy
I believe it would be the 4th fight against Figueiredo..
Viva México cabrones
That was heartwarming as a mutha fucka
What is this WWE 😂 jk
lol that guy following davisom
True class 👏
Such a good dude
I'm mind blown on the views, Brandon really is a star 💯
It will be a pure fire🔥🔥🔥
What an Awesome moment in Sports!
To think the UFC was thinking about getting rid of the 125 LB division is crazy.
bro what is this, a fight proposal? 😅
Este niño es de un raund, dijo Figueredo. Hoy se da cuenta de lo herrado que estuvo con el cara de niño Brandon moreno.
Deiveson is sooooo cringe 🥴
Classy, respectful, tough. How can you not love the UFC.
Well spoken words by both men
Love how the crowd ate their boos after Fig’s comment. These guys are putting on crazy fights for our entertainment. This might be the greatest post-fight interview next to Paddy’s. What a sport!
Was about to be some WWE type shit lol good thing both fighters handled it well
True martial artists wear respect like this effortlessly.
Fig 1 win Moreno 1 win 1 draw , it’s only right they run it back 💪🏼
Puro Gallo Chingon México 🇲🇽♥️
I can't wait for their Fourth fight
Moreno será massacrado novamente por Deivison
Imagine bumping into Brandon Moreno in a bar ? The guy is a vicious assassin and you would never no it with his calm and genuine demeanor.
So much respect and disciplined a true warrior spirit with humility and courage. Respect to both legend
Brandon actually kicked his ass first fight second fight only reason the judges went for the Brazilian was so they could make even more money from the third fight
Fascinating. Figuerado came in with the antagonistic energy. But Moreno just being such a great guy shut all of that down. Got Davison to act like a man worthy of respect.   Amazing moment.
This is some WWE shit right here
What is with these Brazilian fighters never even trying to speak English..  my immigrant grandma learned more in a free English class than this fighters learn their whole careers
👑 Moreno
Love how the UFC replaces the highlight of the finish with other footage. Cheap fucks.
He keeps giving Moreno his left hand and that is so disrespectful!
It's a little bit awkward having Deiveson in there flexing on Moreno while he's trying to talk about his daughter and family.
TWO BAD M'F'ers!
mens flyweight division has come along way it went from almost being gone to now one of the best and most talented divisions
Brandon Moreno = Half saiyan half earthling
Weird style Davidson has
I. Hate how they dont show the god damn finish the us is so fucked all they want is your god damn money
👊🏽🕶🇲🇽🏆Let’s go Champ!
Figgy looking like I gotta fight this mf again🙄🙄🙄
Joe’s head continues to grow like my grandfather’s ears.
I love when legends act like legends. All class gentlemen. All class.
Love this translator whitest dude ever and does a great job
fuck this wwe skit
City KickBoxing was the real loser last night... no wins.
Man that was beautiful, this is what men are on now, less division and more respect for other men and for the sport way to set an example for the next generation
Figgy such a cornball lmfao
Very touching......😪😪
Bramdon killed him with kindness
Moreno is a great example of being a man
WWE
Figueredo is all BS, he's not gonna fight with Moreno, he's forrest gump!
He left the house with his belt 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Class, a true warrior of the traditional class.
The crowd didn't understand Portuguese. Figgy was saying lovely things and they booed thinking he was being disrespectful. xD
Moreno is a beautiful human.
All class this Mexican warrior, viva Brandon!
POS should’ve stayed out of the ring! It was Moreanos night
Bro who’s wife is that
The respect forever more powerful then anything . Happy for them
Y’all don’t understand the balls it took to say what Brandon said to figgy and the bigger balls figgy putting down that wall and shaking his hand that’s class act professional af
Figueiredo Had the perfect chance to be a heel
Hard to believe this division was on the chopping block not long ago. So glad 125 is still here and going strong
But disrespectful bringing in the champ like that taking away moreno’s moment like that
Hombres de respeto
Davison is such a lame, this guy always been a cry baby and childish in the press conferences towards Brandon Moreno, hoping Brandon wins his fight.
Its all good and cool.... but odd to bring in another fighter when Brandon just won.... give him his moment.... Even in that odd light he shined as champ.... I like that dude. Well Brandon...Well Done!
Despite being friends with the díaz brothers he’s a warrior in the cage a benevolent man outside even in front of the enemy
Brandon really needs to work on starting faster. His last two fights he doesn't really turn it up until rounds 2-3. He has to start fighting round 1 at this level of competition
An example for his daughter, Amen!
Tbh I would have pulled a mcgregor. I would like to apologize.....  to absolutely nobody lmfao
I think moreno will win
Great respect for both fighters, what a class.
When u fight someone twice and have crazy battles u see respect like this
He is truly very humble. He deserves to be champion again ✌️
Joe genuinely doesn't know this sport anymore
Bro just KO’d him with kindness 👼🥷
What a guy man Moreno is such a respectful and kind guy you wouldn’t expect him to be an absolute monster in the cage but he has won the hearts of people all over the world that’s a tough ass mf man and a virtuous guy you can’t hate him
Honestly these 2 male fighters are the BEST! They are really good example to the next young fighting generations. Don't take your fight to a personal level! Be professional.
Wonderful how Kai also accepted the loss. Great fight!
Lol wwe moment.
That was tough
Soy argentino pero VIVA MEXICO CABRONESSS
Hell yeah the new ufc stop it with all the bullshit already
Ha they edited out the kick
Is any body gonna talk about how big deiveison looks. Looks like 160
True champ and great guy
One of the best emotional  moment i have ever seen.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 TRUE WARRIORS! Great respect for both. This is awesome!! What a great example they are of true champions 💯💯💯💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
This is pure class
His daughter will always remember this. Huge respects to Moreno💯
Solid fighters. No need for trash talk to sell fights.
moreno already win the fans heart.He is so Humble
Huge respect to both fighters 🙏🙏🙏
Both of those fighters are awe inspiring!!!
B. Moreno,  Is so humble!!!  He's just, Proving that he is... Giving his Best, To be the "Best!'.  🎉🥊🥊🎉
Fucking good to see fighters talking like this. Two brave and polite fighter.
Viva Mexico !!
The world needs to take notes from Brandon
Joe ROgan looks like he’s serving me some bomb ass carbonara
Well when another man walks in the ring and tries to steal your thunder he gets struck by lightning
Brandon 🔥🔥🔥
Moreno totally disarmed Davison in that exchange.  Davison looked like he had every intention of going in the cage and being disrespectful and playing the heel.  When Moreno talked about being an example and offered an apology for any offenses given, Davison didn't know how to react.
CANT WAIT!!!
When you come from nothing at all then you hit greatness and stay humble you win over many many fans Brandon Moreno you will live forever hermano te mereces tu triunfo carnal que dios te bendiga en tu camino 🙏🏽
What was that sound at @3:00 ? Sounded like aa fart hahaha
Shed a tear to his speech, you are a king Brandon 🫡👑
Lol pretending this ring entry isn’t scripted by the ufc and both fighters
Moreno is pure class
Impossible to not like Moreno.  Jus curious: How similar is Portuguese and Spanish as a language? Seemed like Moreno understood Figgy.
These guys are excellent rivals, let them bang bro
that little ball of hate Figueiredo is growing on me lol
Lets not forget about kara france who is an absolute warrior and did great too. Greetings from Mexico!
May be the most pointless interim belt of all time
It’s unfortunate that people aren’t drawn to good sportsmanship as much as they are to intense rivalries.
Deivison: can I bring a plus 1 to the event pls?  Belt: 👌
Poor France man, his stomach is going to hurt for like 2 weeks.
Fuck man :")me and my whole family couldn't stop celebrating this win as if we won ourselves man :""") viva la Raza!!!! Viva Brandon moreno !!! :"""D
Já tá chato ver o UFC tentando forçar o Brandon a ser campeão! Que merdha de Mexicano
VIVA MEXICO VIVA BRANDON MORENO VIVA
All those security. Remember when Lesnar walked in on DC. NO ONE tried to stop him
Respect
Moreno for president of Mexico
Man Figgy is like the Yoel Romero of the flyweight division. White Americans love to hate on him, say he’s dirty etc. but everyone knows he’s the most dangerous fighter in the weight class.
Respect
Mad respect
Let’s go Brandon!! I’m so happy for you can’t wait to see you as champ again🔥
W Men
Love Brandon Moreno ❤️
Elsa painting his nails somewhere
Dam i didnt know they fought in mexico
Who's said UFC becoming WWE 🤣
This was the most WWE post fight interview.
The bait
Still mad disrespectful taking over his interview like this making it all about you after his win
Eso es todo!!
He went in there to start shit and Brandon said all that nice shit and Davidson was like ummm shit ok good job
A true warrior and a humble soul ..
Moreno aready beat this guy the last 2 times
When he said “where is davidson” I died
They gon bang when that next one happen
Joe with the Lex look..
Que humildad de Brandon soy tu fan de ahora en adelante 🔥🔥🔥
Moreno un digno peleador y persona, y también digno representante de los mexicanos
UFC - Get a new sponsor for these videos ffs.
Brandon Moreno trilingual?🤔
This is one of the best memories UFC has given. I love the respect and love these guys show each other.
Momento lindo! Parabéns à maturidade e respeito entre esses 2 grandes atletas que só faz crescer o esporte! Mais uma vez, parabéns aos 2
Respeto
Brandon moreno... 🥰
Dobar covjek Moreno.Pokazuje veliko postovanje prema protivnicima.Sjajan borac i sportista.
I remember a few years ago he had a fight and after it Moreno said something like "maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but someday I will be champion". He was right. He is just a very, very impressive person.
I wished it got dirty when Deividson walked into the cage
Figgy had no idea wtf was going on 😂 probably thought Moreno was talking shit when he was being the nicest dude ever lol
4th fight cmon Joe smoking too much weed😂😭
The world can be a beautiful place even when two men are trying to destroy each other. Many war stories to confirm this opinion.
Cringe af
Este carnal es como el travieso gane o pierda pero no se rinde...
Brandon Moreno is the Best
Tus palabras ♥️
The very humble person. Very humble champ
Moreno is such a good kid. He's right, lead by example. Good things will happen when your positive.
Anyone who says they're tired of Moreno and Figgy have no love for this sport. It's the best rivalry ever. Love watching these dudes go at it. Both of them deserve the title.
Wwe
However painful this was... I think it was needed for the sport..
They could have done a bit better on the mic, but the moment was epic, the trilogy is already incredible and the 4th will be history...!
Rarely do you get a fighter that is a great fighter and a great human being. That's Brandon Moreno.
if Figueiredo and Moreno rematch again, it must be the first time 2 fighters fought 4 times within the UFC alone
Can't wait till this carnival of shit talking ceases to exist in mma and its more honorable... this here is perfect and the way it should be
What a great performance and honor from Brandon!! Both great fighters
thats right moreno 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Moreno's such a classy guy he deserves to be Champion again
Que GRANDE Brandon Moreno! The champion for ever!
Yo my man's sweater is breathtaking! Omg
As a Polish-American Brandon Moreno makes me proud to be Mexican.
So awesome.
Figgy’s a gangster. Look @ the drip 💧
Brandon is a class act
Brandon forgiving him and apologizing too. damn is this what my girl feels like when she watches falling in love in the spectrum. the emotions. ughhhhh
Moreno takes to much damage. His good. But not good enough to be a champion. His defense needs an upgrade
Love you merono from eritrea
Def upset with the result, but you can't not love Moreno.
Champions hold themselves to a higher standard. Colby the rat could learn from these two. No need to sell out kid's
Never miss a Moreno fight!
2 great guy, 2 great fighters. 👍
Nunca habia visto tanta humildad en un deportista, en verdad es impresionante lo de Brandon.   Por este cabron da un chingo de orgullo decir que soy Mexicano.
Moreno is a monster bruh
Let’s go Brandon! Definitely a fan favourite!
Cringe!
Joe dressed like santas acountant😁
Joe paying homeage to Lex Friedman ;)
Those 2 guys been too war twice!!! I fucking love this shit respect, class and love for each other 💪🙏💪 "vamos pa Brazil!!!!!"
🇲🇽
Summer Slam was better :v
I wish figgy would of stayed villain, but the hatred probably was always fight hype. Hard to be at their level without honor and respect.
Figueredo is a good dude I get the sportsmanship behind this move but I won’t lie I actually enjoy Figueiredo more in a heel role. 😭
You can tell deiveson wants to hate Brandon but he just can’t do it . You can’t hate or dislike Brandon . Even KKF doesn’t dislike Brandon after that kick .
Dana didn't like this, just let that sink in
Damn Kai you vs figi would’ve been a barn burner
Run it back!!
Gosh speak english Damn😩
That was class all the way. I'm impressed by both showing class
What a classy respectful kid! How can you not love this young man? Very St Pierre-ish. He is what the UFC needs. His fights are amazing and his heart is that of pure gold. Brings a true balance to the sport. Congrats Champ!
Frigerido all tought looking and Brandon make him tap
Wholesomeness
This is all meaningless. A chasing after the wind.
Respect!
Brandon mereno jeez joe
Grandissimo Brandon Moreno, uomo vero, cuore enorme!
Essa camisa do Figueredo é mt foda, combinou demais com ele
They need to stop with these "interims".
He choked him out and got robbed in the last fight Moreno is the real champ  They jump on that interim belt thing way to quick  It cheapens the real title
Moreno has super hero mannerisms! talks like a martial artist, fights like a true Mexican. And I mean that with the absolute utmost respect. If he beats Figgy he’s going to be one of the most beloved champs for a long time
that flyweight division has such class and respect.
Why was the crowd booing??
his sweater is super tight!!!!!
Fig got some weight to cut
This is the Deiveson Figueiredo I wanna see, good and respectful champion
Seeing these two is like in soccer CR7 vs messi everyone expects them to throw hate at eachother but both admire each other at the highest level
This was some bullshit..Why bring Figgy in the cage?
Que buenas peleas
That was a badass interview. Moreno is one good dude
This is what about martial arts has to be
This was sooo lame! First of all, they took away Brandon's moment. Then Figueirdo comes in looking like a clown, and their conversation is all over the place. UFC trying way too hard.
The champ showing respect for Moreno like that was awesome
Q lindo de se ver 🙌
What a motivation to be a better person.
Brandon Moreno was born a Champion.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow..
Big mistake by UFC.  Davison shouldn’t be so cocky he lost last time, dirty decision.
Yo Brandon said he is "trying" to be a role model for his daughter and fans but bro he IS the role model or the perfect example of a Professional Fighter and Real Man.
Ay devison’s shirt is crispy 😎
Supervillain Davidson 🤣
What is rogan talking about? They already had their 3rd fight this will be there 4th
That’s bullshit they bron that guy into the cage this guy just wanna fight and now they’re bringing this guy in he didn’t even wanna fight this guy bad move
so glad one of Izzy's bf's got fked up
Figueiredo is the new triple C,
That’s one of the most beautiful moments ufc has had in a minute 💙🙌
Moreno should of asked him You peak panish ???
That kick must have hurt even left a mark
Hespect
I want to use my comment to support the idea of UFC Brasil. People like Figueiredo, Oliveira and Nunes deserve to fight on home soil and no doubt it would be an incredilble show. I'm from the UK and I think that if the UFC can come here then it can go to Brazil, because there is more talent on the roster from Brazil than anywhere else. I love Brazil and Brazilian fighters! I hope that the idea gathers momentum and support and we can see it happen!
Só foi o Deiveson sair de perto daquele trouxa do Wallid que está muito mais profissional
Joe Rogan on the Juice!!
How can u not loving moreno? Ure out from this world
Good sportsmanship is key. I mean please remember that we are not watching rejects at fake wrestling with the costumes and stories that McMahon concocted.  This is the big show.
I hope we all appreciate that we're witnessing the peak of human achievement standing in that octagon, round of applause for Chad translator.
So much respect for these guys rn
Them other drama fighters need to take notes on how to act towards another fighter. Respect!
Wishes he doesn't spoil, he is pure, coming from nothing. God bless him. Hi from Puerto Rico.
This just shows that even rivals can have resepect for each other. They are warriors they should have respect for their warrior spirit no matter what
Good sportsmanship figarado and Brandon both respect each other. Nice
Ojala no se dane, Este muchcho es puro, viene de abajo. Dios lo bendiga. Saludos desde Puerto Rico.
Moreno and Figgi have brought life to this Division
He is such a great person and fighter, even more of a great leader and champion. Mexico has a combat sports star!
Joe Rogan wearing a tie...
When are we gonna put Moreno on the upper P4P list?  Should absolutely be there
Thy was so beautiful! You are the best Brandon.
that supposex champ should stay home. If you cant even fking fight, stay the fk home and heal. Dont come iut here and act lile you are ready to fight. if you were ready, we wouldnt see another pointless Intrim belt again. Whats the fking points with all these intrim belts
Respect brandon!!!
What a moment for the Flyweight Division 🏆
class acts
Pantoja vs davison depois pantoja vs moreno.
Why does figgy look like he's inflated up to 225 lbs?
No esperaba menos de cualquier Mexicano. Puros Guerreros!!!!!
Imposible no respetar a Brandon... Saludos desde Uruguay
Brandon is a prime example of how to compose yourself as the champ and without the belt but he needs to run it back with David I get a feeling Brandon FINISHES David this time
Is he a mexican
Great speech by Moreno. All aspects. Even that look at 3:12 that let Figueredo know “I might be a nice man, but I’ll go to war with you.”   Bravo all around.
Lovely Moreno, respected guy
I forgive you brother… Please forgive me if I done anything wrong to you…💯💯💯 In front of the world real stand up Guy…
Esse Cinturão Desse Moreno vale nada Cinturão de Papel 😂
Esse Moreno é Ridículo vai perder e ser esmagado pelo Figueiredo
Worst promo ever
Random fan: SPEAK ENGLISH DAMM IT!
These 2 champions  are awesome
si se puede, la concha de la lora
Moreno gives wonderboy a run for his money as the NMF.
Don’t Eva trust a man who shake with his left hand
Respect for both but I don't want to buy a ppv with them headlining, again.
gay 🌈
Graças a Deus Walid foi embora, se ainda estivesse por trás do Deivison com certeza montaria um show de vergonha alheia para esse momento!
Gentlemen
Respect for all.
Yes sir, put some respect on deiverson name
Beautiful
I don’t know why Dana thought this was disrespectful. They both respected each other and promoting their next fight.
mma is all about respect, moreno a true warrior
Lets be honest Brazil guy will kill him again
Hermoso momento, inolvidable
These 2 are some real ones !!! Respect !!!
Cringe
I love boffem
Daico vs The assassin baby 4 😱
Weird I remember khabib and connor
They shouldnt have let Figgy in tbh, took the wind out of Moreno' sails. Give the man his moment!
Brandon Moreno is a good human being👏👏👏👍
Man I hope Moreno gets a 100 million dollar endorsement deal or just turns into a huge superstar
So much history has been made with brandon moreno he became the first mexican champion he's become the first flyweight interim champion and now hes most likely gonna be in the first ever quadrilogy in ufc history. He absolutely has dominated he's division he's beat everyone in the top 5 expect pantoja
Dana can actually do Brazil mega event : Charles vs Connor Izzy vs Perreira Jiri vs Glover Figgy vs Brandon Amanda vs Valentina
Moreno is such a baby. Go play your video games!!!
Such integrity and a wonderful example of sportsmanship!
Bad move , low PPv route
His wife gotta be mad at him or something lol
Fans boo turned into little bit calm after Figi’s respect to Moreno. This was the wholesome of the time. Beside the fight, things like this make memory forever.
ahh so sweet, when is the marriage?
What a Mexican!!! I fucking love that dude!!
Lmao that monster can is a prop lmao.
Brandon Moreno is simply an excellent human being. This man has it all. Heart, dedication, respect, humility, love, discipline, everything. He's got it all. Inspiring man. Rare to see someone set such an amazing example on TV these days. LG champ!
Pride of Mexico congrats to the champ 🇲🇽
Figgy came in ready to talk trash and make threats but he chose peace. I really hope he remains respectful in the lead up to their next fight.
Once upon a time ! I was in love with maxican girl but now, I change my mind and love moreno forever😁🤭🤭🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Class👏🏼👏🏼
Top 10 legendary ufc moments
How can u not like this guy, so pure hearted.. huge fan of him he's a bad puto Madre ✊🏿❤️🙏🏿
Moreno is such a giant what an amazing inspiring kid
Lessgoooo, this was so epic!! Both main and co-main were solid!
Puro pinche Moreno
This was great. Loved this, much respect to both guys.
I felt bad for Kai after seeing this. Dude had barely left the cage before this happened. And he'd just fought his heart out.
They must make a big movie about the rivalry between Moreno and figueiredo
Moreno is such a likable guy.
Viva Mexico mfs 🇲🇽🦾
This is a feel good moment regardless of who won these men brought the best out of eachother
Brandon Moreno is one of my All-Time Favorite Fighters.
I love figgy at first he was ready to cause a scene to sell the 4th fight then he realized Brandon was being cool and swapped it up to be a nice and sell the fight that way both are genius and gain fans from this. I absolutely respect both and cannot wait for the 4th rematch!
Kelvin Gastelum in suit look slick
Well that was weird, why they bring him in. Who tf knows
El otro como si nada y Brandon moreno en modo Rocky Balboa...
Guys Kai Whether you like him or not was doing very good until that liver shot. Would not be surprised to see him back in there for a title shot one day. It’s not like he got destroyed.
Tuf lost a opportunity when they should have done Covington and Usman. At least we know the pay-per-view main event would have been awesome. I knew Amanda was going to destroy her. It made watching the ultimate fighter not that great knowing one of them was going to lose easily
This is why UFC will always e second to boxing they got 2 guys on the same level that can't beat each other but with no other route to go they need more belts
i didnt cry...you did bro
mireno, mireno, moreno, .... مقاتل محترم بالفعل.
Bruh the UFC is trash now .....
There's is no such thing as the flyweight division it's just the figgy vs Brandon Moreno division now
Moreno is a 🌟
Moreno is a nice guy
I mean let’s be honest there not much of a fight that division besides these 2 I’m sure they don’t want to fight eachother at all but they kinda have too. That flyweight pathjia?? Won tonight but that is like a next matchup on whether wins if it goes out In December. They had a lot of respect for eachother tho I liked that
Bruh this was tough not cringe at all like I’ve seen in one comment dudes straight said I respect you no hate I just wanna fight
Pure class
Its surreal watching Joe Rogan in a suit and tie.. Congrats to Brandon Moreno!!!
Brandon Moreno is my current active favourite fighter. The guy is a chill killer ready to dig deep and grind everybody
Beautiful. If anything I think this made people like figueredo more and the next fight is gonna be insane. Let’s go Moreno!
joe not wearing a black shirt is messing with me
Joe Rogan do you want to fight a 3rd time with Figueiredo they already fought 3 time haha it would be the 4th
Nothing short of brilliance
The quadroligy 😂😂
Brasil and Mexico United Latin Brotherhood!
How did they teach that buff penguin to do post-fight interviews?
Love Moreno
1:37 man already fought him a third time this would be the 4th if it happened again
Moreno for the kill
This is HISTORY right there!  And an example of true Sportsmanship for all the upcoming young fighters!!
Rogan peeping Figgy's sparkly shirt @ 2:26 was low key funny
Vamos brandon argenhina esta contigo
Merino is my new favorite guy I think.....even tho I prolly just fucked his name up
That segment with Davidson was just heart warming ... He wants to set and example and be a good person and even Davidson acknowledged that .. this sport respect triumphs all
It's crazy how biased and shameful human spits are about  David like let's show our family love being biased about who we like the most etc we have our opinion but if you don't see with your heart then you can't see two man who are fight with heart we gotta respect that people honorable things have spiritual vaule in the after life and vaule in generation currency love and peace you bastards ✌️✌️✌️✌️😂
God bless your guys
Well that got off to an awkward start
Everything is cyclical and it goes by eras. No tattoos,  then all tattoos. Then no tattoos. Facial hair,  no facial hair, facial hair. Politeness and class, attitude/rude, now thankfully I think we are coming back to the classy/honorable era. 👍
Made me a fan good kid pure
Love this guy man..gonna get his belt back he won the last fight..
.... he won the interm belt, who do you want to fight🤔 then ask the champ if he wants to fight the interm for the undisputed belt.....ummm what was the fucking point of the interm belt again?
Good fucking kid
Real fighter
how can you not love brandon moreno
Great promo.  GOAT promo alongwith GSP and Matt Huges & DC and Brock Lesnar.
Brandon Moreno is such a stand-up guy! Hope he regains his world title next time out.
Lot of respect for Brandon very educated kid and respectful fighter
Deiveson before entering the octagon: 😡😎👿👊🏽 Deiveson after approaching Brandon: 😐😉🙌🏼
Moreno is a real class act. very respectful.
Bro this was awesome!
So much respect for the two champs
Three of the best in the division, massive respect shown by each of them, a credit to their families, the UFC organisation and an inspiration to any young fighters out there of how to conduct them selves to their fellow fighters. 👏👏👏👏
Still think Moreno won the 2nd fight as well. It's a joke that he didn't get an immediate rematch because Figgy chose to duck hoping he would lose to KKF.
That was pretty cool ngl
I get they were trying to start promoting the 4th fight but this was completely ignorant don’t have that man come in there during this man’s moment
Lots of respect for Moreno, stand up guy, humble and thankful. 🥊🇲🇽
Kai nvr win on movsar
Wow
With Mexican blood Nobody loves Hispanics Don't underestimate US GOD BLESS MORENO
Moreno deserved to win this and should be the champion still but I hope he wins this next fight against Davidson because he deserves it all such a real and humble fighter 💙
UFC always got a Portuguese translator somewhere in a corner or a dark room. Only let out to translate.
Brandon representa todo de lo que debe ser mexicano 🇲🇽
that translator made that translation into  some braveheart shit ! 💪🏽
Moreno is a fucking warrior
When it come to selecting whos the best flyweight in UFC  I'm gonna say it's  1. Brandon moreno  2. Demetrius Johnson  3.devison figuredo  4.henry cejudo.
That was pathetically painful.
For the ones who reads this just know this is only the beginning keep pushing, grinding, and fighting. Whatever it is in life you want to do to go after it life is to short. Life is a marathon not a sprint so go out there and live it up I hope all is well and goes well for you peace and one love!🙏🏽✌🏽
Wow both fights, hats off, I’m loving the new wave of fighters, friendly but deadly !! I’m tired of the mcgregor wild talk and then come fight night, they disappoint. Don’t hype me up for a below average performance, come in humble and let your training speak for itself!! Ready for the next fight in Brazil or Mexico !!
So are we not gettin Figgy with it anymore?
brandon is the real deal, hes one if the heroes of mma for sure
BRANDON IS TRAIRA
Such class between the two
flyweight division look good after this card
Why would they allow him in the cage? Its disrespectful to Brandon. Let him have his own moment.
LEGENDARY
Who’s the baddie in the back?
No es campeón la correa es del brasileño
Mad respects to all three
Sikap juara sejati..!!
Kia was lucky to get his previous wins. Hopefully he comes back stronger 💪🏽❗
Felicidades y ke viva Mexico 🇲🇽
Respect ♥️
The crying baby is too much bitching about Figueiredo all the time.
The best example of humans
Mexicos finest, brazils finest. This will be the stuff of legends
Assassin Baby assassinating!! Can't wait for him to FINISH figgy pudding AGAIN. Moreno and figgy pudding tie- Moreno TAPS OUT figgy pudding- *Why was there a 3rd fight again?* Moreno loses in *contestable* decision to figgy pudding- Moreno is coming to assassinate figgy pudding-
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🤳🏾🚀🤳🏾
Good man
Viva la México 🤌😍
Man this is why this is the GREATEST sport on the planet!
Why would they bring this man into the cage bums...
I like brandon and oliveira. They are the true warrior of this sport.
In this next fight, I will be on Morenos side, Figueiredo is very irritating. And I am Brazilian.
Aún siendo La pelea en Brazil Brandon sabe que siempre abra mexicanos apoyándolo ♥️💪🇲🇽
How can you not like Moreno
Moreno tremeu kkkk
Muchas felicidades para Brandon Moreno por su gran triunfo lo felicito desde la República Dominicana.🇩🇴🇩🇴🥋🥊🥊
Legendary
Massive respect for fighters. Look at the mark left on Kai's ribs, after that kick. You can literally see the shape of Moreno's foot. It must have been perfect, considering it got him to completely turtle shell. Sad thing is you could see him trying to fight back but he's body just wouldn't respond. Must be horrible feeling so powerless in that instant. Congratulations to Moreno & respect to Kai.. Amazing fight.
Still confused how moreno is 5'7 and looks the same size as 5'4 Kai.
How not to love Moreno. What an amazing human beeing!
As a flywieght, much respect to all 125ers! MMA is the most beautiful violent sport!
It's hard to root against the Champ. LETS GO BRANDON
nice to see the chad translator there
Figuereido is such a clown 🤡
Moreno and Poirier are such a breath of fresh air for the UFC

Respect!! Brandon Moreno!!🇲🇽
This moment gave goosebumps !
Moreno makes me want to be better. Be MOREno!!!! ✊✊✊
Can’t dislike Moreno always so respectful
Moreno makes me want to be better. BE MOREno!!! ✊
What is up with the interim belts?  Can someone explain?
B. Moreno has been proving to be a top contender throughout every bout, I hope this man to get all the credit he deserves and more. He’s a humble and very respectful man. We need more like him.
Maybe the best rivalry in the past 10 years
Moreno fan forever ❤️
What an amazing display of sportsmanship let me respect and class. True martial artists
Never trust a man that shakes with his left hand.
Figgy  is an awesome fighter man both moreno  and figgy are levels above the others
Real champions 👏🏽
Joe rogan is so biased it’s amazing..
BRANDON MORENO IS PURE LOVE
🇧🇷
Dana wanted to scrap this division, the fucking GOOF
Great sportmanship from both! Cant wait for the fight!
I want a shirt line daveison
Brandon  had an interview   from a thumb wearing a suit?
This man's a fucking boss
Ole por moreno
Wholesome ass shit...
WWE vibes lol
The sportsmanship between these two is amazing.
I'm fucking so proud to be Mexican 🇲🇽
Gutted that Kai didn’t win
Brandom moreno e brabo fa desse mexicano pprt 🇧🇷
How can u not love Brandon?!?
Yeah morano is as goofy as his stance...I mean seriously, u jus won an interm belt, this guy who already beat u twice comes in n shoves his ACTUAL REAL belt in ur face, n u sit there n say I'm sorry for anything I done to u? Cmon man....
Figgy won't make weight in the 3rd fight
I'm fan of Figgy since he showed respect to Moreno after the second  fight!!! Of course fan of Moreno as well!!🇧🇷🇲🇽

Why is there an intermin champion for flyweight? I dont get it. The real champion was still active
I can get behind a guy like Brandon Moreno. Dudes humble and has the heart of a warriors. Go get your belt back champ!
Attention Triple C- you don't need to be a clown to get respect.
This has WWE vibes to it lol.
Figgy wanted to talk shit but Moreno ruined it lol.  He couldn't trash him after he gave that speech. He made a quick adjustment 😆
These guys are a class act. Big Respect!
Humble fighters usually wins
Moreno has the biggest heart in the game. A true class act.
This is becoming WWE
Typical Americans booing Figgy because they don't understand what he's saying, turns out he was being a respectful and honourable gentleman
“You couldn’t pay me a million dollars to take that kick” Jesus Christ I’d let him kick me in the head afterwards for a million. Being broke sucks
Brandon that dude .. class & super sharp kickboxer for a wrestler
I love theyre respect Nice fight moreno kai
Cant wait for this fight Moreno deserve that
Man Moreno is such a great guy dude ❤️. Shows such respect man ✨
Ambos se respeitaram, o Deivison foi lá e elogiou o campeão e convidou para uma luta no Brasil !
Amazing!
Let’s go Moreno
Come on, play a little character 😄 embrace the boos Davison
Not again
nearly 😢 cabron moreno ❤ every time
I thought this was going to end up like some WWE bullshit,but they both showed respect to eachother.
Why show the interview talking about the strikes that end the match but not show the strikes?!? Like you do realize this doesn't gain fans right?
Moreno e Deiveson dois exemplos de garra. Grandes lutadores
Such a blessing to witness this in this era man
this was weird lmfao this was like some sht you would see on WWE
What a sports man I Love it.. that's a true fighter warrior...
Hey in the UFC you don't have the like each other but you got to show respect to each other 👍👍👍👍
What type of WWE crap is this…..
What a guy Brandon Moreno 👏🔥
Feggerriro is not the champ the judges gift him the title
The longer this company is alive, the more it feels like the WWE.   And it all started with Brock and DC 😅🤣
UFC make that interim belt as silver
Moreno agreeing to that fight in Brazil might not be a smart move.
Крутое интервью
Joe Rogan is 5ft 3
It is so good to see Brandon wearing gold again
Class act, breath of fresh air, it would be good if the ufc plugged respectable fighters just as much as the shit talkers, im bored of the shittalking, its bullshit....brandon moreno ,a true champ, leading by example for himself, his family, his kids, the world, just class, more people like this please
That fight need to happen!!
I haven't Admired, someone like Brandon Moreno in a long, long time. He's like a Super Hero to millions and specially to me, I love you man. You are a inspiration to  all people.
Moreno is just a super nice guy man. Elite level kindness
Him and wonderboy are the nicest humblest fighters in the promo
Never trust a man that shakes with his left hand !
2 back to back amazing post fight interviews in 2 weeks..Paddys and now Brandons.
45 4747
uu 646u46u
Could have been a train wreck live on PPV but to both fighter's credit very well handled, very classy.
That boy need to learn to shake hands with the right hand
January Brazil This fight and oliveira vs. volkanovski
Brandon won 2 of them fights and Davidson standing there like he dominated him give in bro u got wooped and Moreno gonna finish u for good
Rescpect bangke
This guy rules.
Pure class
Feel bad for Kai. Really like and respect Brandon, but hate that he’s gotta showboat during the fight. I think he’s better then that.
Highly respect to both fighter ....
Sponsorship has gotten ridiculous you can't just put a can up while the guy is at the post interview you have to HOLD it now in the cage? Absolute utter buffoonery.
Figureido already f@_ked him up twice not interested.
Figueiredo vs Moreno 4
I dint know who they where
🇲🇽👏🙏
I was supporting Kai Kara France but respect Brandon Moreno for a very good performance 🔥
Love the respect but i would've preferred some drama especially how it was already set up..
Brandon will win easy another too for him
awkward  handshakes 🙆😅🤭
Is Joe skipping leg day?
Boring 😴 conor era finish? Thanks good for Paddy
This will be epic we just going to be the part of UFC history 😝😝😝😝
Greatest rivalry. Its just about the art and who is better.
This guy keeps growing on me man, i try to be an example for my daughter, for the world. Brandon moreno was raised very very well.
You can't hate Brandon, his such a humble and nice person. Awesome human being..
I could feel the despair in Brandon wanting Deveison to please accept the fight
Respect
3tt4 34
wett4
That translator speaking 3 languages fluently is impressive
Prop to the translator. ❤️
All this 3 fighters are TRUE WARRIORS. Respect them for their behavior. They are a role model.
Brandon Is such a great guy ! And the Brazilian translator is the best in the business!
So much class
Moreno got the dude shaking in his boots tu can tell 😂😂
Always loved this type of sportsmanship on MMA. Brandon Moreno my favorite flyweight fighter!!!
Yes this is what wwe could never be
Haven’t they already fought 3 times wouldn’t this be the 4th
Kicked the life out of him, you don't see it too often in UFC TKO with bodykick
On the real it’s nice to see a fight made this way. I like trash talk but it’s everyone goes to now. This was class .
Loved how they agreed to december 🔥🔥🔥
tttwtt
Figueredo lost three times and he disrespected Moreno trying to steal his moment...let's go Moreno
from TIJUANA MEXICO LETS GO BABY
Joe in a white shirt and tie is just off putting
Brandon whooshed his ass  he got robbed
Happy for my man once more🤗🤗🤗
trash
Such class! 🙌🏻
He deserved it 👏❤️ Congratulations Moreno🎊
honestly... ufc fucked up on this one. let the man have his time and speak after a win ... they fed the douche in the plastic knit sweater into the ring and stole the spot light with Joe d bag Rogan with his tight ass no neck white button up... sad
With the way Figgy came into the octagon holding his belt up in front of Moreno, I think he was planning on putting on a show.  I love the humbleness Moreno brought, and how he said he wants to set an example for his daughter. That's a highly skilled, humble killer right there.  Moments like these are way more appreciated than all the WWE wannabe crap that we've been seeing for years now, in opinion anyways.  I'd like to see Moreno re-capture that gold again. It's going to be a war.
Brandon Moreno is basically MMA version of Ippo Makunoichi
martial artists 🎨
Joe looks like Kingpin
Class act
UFC sucks for not showing the kick 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Monster energetic bullshit still there smfh
Finally put some respect on this translator!
What a classy sportsman Moreno is. Himself and Figgy are just a cut above the rest at Flyweight at the minute. 2 absolute warriors that between them have changed Flyweight from one of the most, if not the most disrespected divisions in the entire UFC and have brought attention and excitement through their 3 wars.
Love this guy
Hold a can of Monster while just having your face bashed in -- ha ha!  Monster should be ashamed.
Im mexican for 25 minutes when Brandon fights 🇬🇧🤝🇲🇽
Always respected him but its so refreshing to see real sportsmanship and not the WWE b/s of recent years.
Everyone loves Brandon 💚
É serio isso???
Baby assasin... Respect 🙏
Respect for Brandon no one like brandon in UFC great fighter 👋
Class acts. Both of them
What a Fucken living LEGEND 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Sick of these fights. It’s because the ufc ranking system is fucked up these fights just to milk they cow dry. They fought few times already . Same with Holloway violkanovski everyone knew wat would happen
God's shouldn't be competing against Gods to be honest🇧🇷🇲🇽👎🏿
Joe Rogans neck is wider then Brendan Morenos waist lol 😂 facts 💯
me la pelan
Wtf was that WWE?
Flyweight is the funnest division in the UFC. Straight up. Deivison and Moreno are both superstars. Matt Schnell had one of the craziest fights this year and Pantoja is a mad dog. Demetrious Johnson and Henry Cejudo could never bring this level of excitement to this division. 125, right now is ridiculous.
WWE
This is what sport's all about,mutual respect .
I thought Figgy was gonna come in and be a douche, but he had great sportsmanship. this is what this sport is all about.
Classic
davison esta parecendo o tiririca🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fight fans are so toxic....nothing but respect between the fighters
Graças a Deus Figueiredo tomou uma postura muito honrada em confronto com o Moreno. Fodao. O mexicano é um grande lutador, carismático e merece respeito.
Great Champion.
Not third time.. Its gonna be 4th time if they fought again..
now this is a fucking promo
I'm finna cry such a gorgeous moment!
stuck up wife over there like c'mon let's go already 🤣. crossing her hands 🤣

Real champ. Hope he will win Figueiredo
Doesn’t get better then this all respect between two opponents
Legendary
My life has totally changed since I started an investment of $ 6,000 and now earning over $ 57,000
This is legendary. Fuck
The fact that kara france' rib was reddish asf shows how powerful that kick
Love Brandon style
Moreno is a class act
Wonderful
Both City Kickboxing prospects got pushed to the back at UFC 277.
After Mcgregor destroyed sportsmanship. Sportsmanship is now back!
Cringe
Pure class from Moreno
Mexican McLovin 💪
I love their fights from the begining hope it goes well❤️
I can dig it
This was a great fight! Won't Moreno vs Figueiredo 4 Be the first time two fighters have fought each other 4 times? I could be wrong, But I can't think of any off hand..
That ending was lame as hell
Both amazing and powerful
Moreno it’s changing the sport
Congratulation sir Brandon 👆👍👍
damn that one kick changed all amazing job tho Gratz moreno
Brandon Moreno is good champion and good human
Davison is good guy ..I don't know why people boo him .He is the champion
This men are eternal rivals, to think ufc was going to make the mistake to shutdown this division.
So much Respect and spectrum here… I love these two real Mens
They shouldn’t have allowed him in to see assassin baby vulnerable. WWE
Does Moreno understand Portuguese?
What I love about Figuereido is that he's too much of a nice guy to keep his bad guy character
Wow just wow true sportsmanship
Can't wait for Assassin Baby vs Mini Militia Soldier.
Wow Brandon, great young dude. 💪💪💪
Amazing fair play!
I don't understand why people hate deiveson figueredo the guy was fighting consistently and had a crazy first fight with Brandon the guy does deserve some respect ngl
How a callout should be done respect to both men!
Why is that Guy doing screamimg into the Mic.
This fight didn’t disappoint, my boi fell back a bit but the outcome was greater 💯 Family above all laws
Brandon Moreno truly represents the Mexican fighter ! Always ready, anywhere you just let me know but upmost respect for this man who instead of promote a fight with slurs and insults reminds himself he is an example first to his daughter !
Ammazing!!
Lovely Moreno ended with don't get it twisted, I wanna fight... Yeah, this is professional sport, not personal fights.
These are real fighters!!!
i just dont understand why joe is asking both of the fighters if they plan to fight each other. Like since when has an interim title holder done anything but fight the unification bout joe? Why are you so awkward these days?
Imagine coming to Texas and wearing a sweater in the summer.
Figgy gave Brandon his left hand...The disrespect is real🤣
Rogan looks like a meatball in a suit
Bruh this was so fucking awkward holy shit😂 Moreno should've said those things without inviting him to the octagon.
Moreno much more than fan fighter, he's got serious heart! Huge respect mate
1:46 Roberto mtz 😳
Jai hind Jai Ho Both champs 👍👍👍🌟🌟🌟🙏🙏🙏🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
WOOOOOOWWW 🇲🇽💣
Rty
What a fucking guy!
What an incredible role model, ambassador for the sport and what a moment
Fuck me joe   you are a multimillionaire you can afford clothes that fit . Also why do you look like you've just came back from a funeral
That was cool!
This was a beautiful moment. Pure class from both of them.
0:33 Dana wants his privilege to slide into her 🍑😂😂😂
Those two are writing history. Amazing to see the sportsmanship. The winner of their fight will take over the world.
Respect to Moreno man, so humble and professional and when Davidson walked in Moreno showed nothing but respect and positivity.
Figgy looks like he is 195lbs
Nice promo Moreno lemme just take a nap 😴 🗿
Brandon is a Legend! 💪🏽
JRE with Lex suit, love it!
Proud of our Maori Warrior ...... ETU, lets go 3 man les run this back deserving aye
morenos voice is so cute
he deserve it
Bruh joe Rogan's got a tie on
🥹
Why is he carrying the belt?
France "We are going up against the best"
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Figgy had no choice but to shake hands other than that I don’t think he would of done that. He knows where he’s at 🇲🇽🇲🇽
The translator needs to get noticed
Crowd sucks.
Damn fine display, gentlemen. Damn fine. Now THAT is the behavior of true champions. Well done.
The thumbnail got me thinking it’s straight beef but watching it was really a genuine wholesome moment. Respect to both of these two amazing athletes 💯
How can you not love this guy
Legendary
Bravo gentlemen
👏👏👏👏
This translator is such a giga Chad. Biggest cajones in the building
Best translator in the game
These fighters show pure class plus... Wtf just happened?
I love this respect to both they understood what sports is about
He just made his promise again.
David adesanya 😂
It took me too long to realize that the translator is in fact the great film director Christopher Nolan.
Holy respect for Moreno Batman!
Brandon Moreno is to kind for the ufc. That whole thing felt disrespectful. Totally stole his moment and morphed into a promo. Hope the dude gets that belt back
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
That BRAZILLIAN TRANSLATOR IS THE BEST EVER!  "THE CHAMP HAS A NAME AND ITS CHARLES OLIVIERA".  THE RUSSIAN SHOULD HAVE A GREAT TRANSLATOR LIKE HIM TOO SO THAT KHABIB, ISLAM AND OTHER RUSSIAN FIGHTERS MAY UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLES ARE TALKING ABOUT.. lol
this translator is the GOAT
Take some English classes,too much Brazil translate
Best ever.
I liked that he didn’t want his kindness to be seen as weakness. Don’t be confused he still wants to fight. Epic
🥱😴
Toma  fala portuges brother
There is nothing that melts my heart and brims my face with a smile more than seeing opponents showing genuine respect after a fight.
Rogan asking a question and handing the mic to Fig forgetting it needs to get translated first 😆
Goat translator back at it again 🐐
big characters... big men
Moreno.  What an example of a great decent humble man
Damn Deiveson is huge for a flyweight lol.
*Respect*
Two elite flyweights cant  get better.
Idc about seeing this 4 times I loved the last 3 so far can’t wait!
massive respect
Moreno is.a long gas tank
This is hype they stole the show I'm hear for that fight awesome
Fair
Mexicanos when we really fight..very few can beat us....
2 rivals who have made each other better fighters
I thout it was gonna be a Brock & DC moment but it turned out the opposite, these 2 really bringing shine to the Flyweights.
I like both of these fighters, I don't know why for some reason both of them makes me happy. We know Figgy is also a chill dude and when he plays heel, I also enjoy it lol. Mad respect to Moreno for performing how he has performed in this day.  Figgy vs Moreno will never end up in a boring fight.
I love this guy
We need a tetralogy between Figueiredo and Moreno
I guess this is the real "let's go Brandon" wagon.... Right?
Viva Mexico, it’s great seeing a friendly rivalry for once. These men are competitive af but they keep it in the octagon. They realize it’s all love and they don’t mind helping each other succeed and be relevant.
2:09 family
that shit was awesome, was it me or did brandon seem a lil scared at first tho?
Talk all these nice things about deivison and come out like - “don’t get me wrong I still want to fight you” and deivison just hugged him. It made me think deep. This ain’t a fight for us, is for them, their legacy.
Amazing man
both these guys got Pantoja in the back of their mind 👀
It was kinda cringy, but fe!t good generally
Yo, that’s a beautiful rivalry and respectful. It’s about the sport, and the battle itself. No need for disrespect between real warriors who know better.
Love this 🍺❤️ respect to all 3 Kai , Brandon , and Deivison ! Wish the best for all 3 regardless
Kaikara gonna be add in gustafson ortega club
@Freestylebender spotted
Ufc has turned into a fckn ppv wwe circus.
This guys a true Mexican warrior, a fighter and a gentleman. He’s the GGG of MMA 🫡 Canelo should really learn something from these two honorable fighters
That's the root of what MMA is all about, not all those trending fake WWE stints, yes it's entertaining and sells fights but elite skills, behavior, and character exceeds entertainment.
Bet on him to win against an acquaintance, I knew Moreno would win! I think a future Figueiredo fight is still 50/50 though.  I'll give the cardio and toughness edge to Moreno, but Figueiredo hits like a truck and what an athlete as well.
I DIDN"T SEE ANY KICK.
The crowd booing never cease to amaze me.   Expressing sportsmanship and gettin boo'd for it lol
Nice jumper
This was BS he's lucky Moreno is so humble!!
I how brought his belt to the fights and it's on his shoulder. You don't see it much other fighters doing. Gotta be like WWE guys and ladies cherish and wear their belts everywhere.
Great. These two again.  Weak division.
Brandon is such a great human being ☝🏻 top class right there 🏆
Straight Outta Tijuas 664 🔥👊🏽🔥
I like this so much better than the shit talk; makes it feel more like a real sport. Can't wait for the Rematch!
Beautiful. The respect in the most savage of sports. Both guys are an example to us all.
They have sold the hell outta that rematch🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Morena is rapidly turning into my favorite fighter.  Such a solid guy. Already an absolute legend.
Holy shit that made me feel
Amazing....😀
Brandon is so nice he made me not dislike Figueiredo.
That went really well. I'm glad
I love this division.  Alex Pantoja could beat both of them and might have 2 years ago too, but instead we got Brandon & Figgy in an epic series of fights and people still don't know who Pantoja is lol.  The most underrated division in the Ufc
I find figuerdo so try hard and embarrassing😂😂😂😂🤦‍♂️💀
Brandon need to get the NMF belt from Wonderboy. He is not fake nice like Poirier and many other dudes ... this dude is just pure man.
Moreno leads by example and is the prime example of what fighting with your heart can achieve ❤️
cringe
That was beautiful! Love really does conquer all. My respect couldn't be deeper.
Nobody can hate Brandon What that guy’s awesome
Great sportsmanship. I love it 😍
I was waiting for a slap😆
KKF was just starting to show why he's right up there with Figgy and Moreno - but such a clean body shot, love Moreno - these two put on a show.
That’s rite homie you got your belt back
Hes a Illumanati
RIGHT IN THE KISSER. I MEAN THE LIVER. CAN SEE THE MARK ON KAI✔
WWE
This was so disrespectful to step into the octagon and take Moreno’s moment - if it wasn’t for Moreno rising above and being a class act it would have been shameful. Versace bling is so cliché nou·veau riche
I didnt Get what Figueiredo’s problem was.  Can somebody explain it to me ?
Brandon is so pure 🥺
Im a kiwi but I love Moreno. Spirit of a warrior.
Moreno did put up a show as expected n emerged as a winner. I love watching him fight 💪💪💪
Colby Covington et al, take some notes on how to be classy.
Hhh that's damn cringy lol
🥹
Love it! This is MMA at its best!
Ufc needs paddy to get to this level fast. The ufc champs are all pussys and boring as fuck
Brandon is the greatest sportsman 🏆 Congratulations Champ!!
No vale verga el brasileño! Viva México Cabroneees!
According to the subtitles we have a new highway champion of the world. Man we live in exciting times.
Honorable to say the least
Man, I love that. What a good show of sportsmanship between two champions.
Just saying it’s their fourth fight. Not their Third
What a fight.  Now that weasel Deiveson Figueiredo cant run and hide now.
Es todo y puro México !!!?💯💯💯💪
Now this is what I call CLASS! Respect from two fighters and just doing it for the love of the sport. Its not all highlight reels and all that shit. Those are just the bonuses.  Y'all booing cuz you didn't get the results that you wanted from the previous fights of these gentlemen. Grow some balls y'all. Seriously. Can't wait for them to duck it all out again for the trilogy! ❤️
🔥🔥🔥
the crowd.... typical arrogant ignorance!  SMH!
Not you night Kai but you be back
Class act. Respect to both Champs 👏🏻
Love the respect shown at the end of this fight CHEERS to the winner from AOTEAROA NEW ZEALAND 🤠🍻🤠👍
Fuck that shit. A 4th crappy fight. Flyweight really sucks l
Fuerza Tijuas saludos
Thailand @ Bakkok 🙏💪💪💪
Brandon nothing but respect brother..🤙🏽 From a kiwi
Seriously thought Brandon WAS the flyweight champ not IC , what the fuck happened?! Somebody please explain
Came for post fight brawl...leaving disappointed.
Brandon is epic!
I like you my bro brandon..you the real champ..next
4th time
Intermediate camera angles
Brandon has one of the biggest heart , keep going champ
Brandon EJEMPLAR
Meanwhile Brandon's daughter at home saying "kill him daddy!"
Are y’all cutting onions in here or what😭👏💯
I MUST BE ON ANOTHER PLANET ,WHEN DID BRANDON LOSE THE BELT!? HE IC CHAMP NOW TF I THOUGHT HE WAS THE CHAMP NOT IC
Who tf is this guy- rude as fuck to let him walk up
This dude got taken advantage of having figgy in the ring after this win. Let the guy have his moment of glory.
Such a class act
they aint gonna gonna sell a fourth by shaking hands  figgy shouldve kept the glasses on and shoved him like brock did dc
Fig should not have won thier last fight. I. Always right when it comes to this sport. Just like how I told y’all Peña doesn’t stand a chance against nunes in a rematch. Y’all are casual dick riders. Switch when the going gets tough and claim a new fav fighter
Demetrius Jonson & Moreno are probably the biggest nerds in combat sports yet they're some of the best fighters
You love to see it if we had more human beings like this Earth would be better 🙏❤
Such BS that they brought him up.
The translator with the same energy as what figgy said
Respect sih ma Brandon Moreno... Best attitude
😉😎👏👏👏👏👏👂👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏I Lov3 This fighter...Nice Man Moreno
Figgy is naturally hilarious lmao
Figueiredo 3:1
The Latino Goku vs Vegeta.
I want 5 rounds!
Chael Sonnen is seething watching Figgy play nice 🤣.
Genuine respect between to fighters that come fight night want to beat the shit out of each other,sometimes honest humble challenges and acceptance is more entertaining than hate between 2 fighters.
ASI ES COMO SE VENDE UNA PELEA VAMOOOOOOS BRANDON
😉😎👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Why does figgy still have that bump?
Moreno is the man.
Much respect to these two warriors, can't wait to see them run it back again!
figuereido cringey
I love shit talking and a good grudge match, but seeing fighters that have had battles in the past respect eachother and continue to have those battles moving forward is so cool. Reminds me of the ward gatti saga
Now suddenly there are two champions irrespective of who wins. This was real and not staged. UFC couldn't have asked for a better fight promotion than this. Much much deep respect to both fighters.
Wow this is the most beautiful octagon interview I have ever witnessed. After this interview Both are legend in my view.
Awesome fight, Moreno had the edge at the beginning of the fight then Kai adjusted and then started to capitalize until Moreno landed that body kick! 👏
This was so cringe bringing him in the ring. Don’t  do it again UFC……
Legendary moment! They had the perfect translator too
The Brazilian going to win again
Love this guy so much he is so kind
Iconic moment.
I’m sooo proud to have the best Mexican champion. Blood is all, ego is tested , respect is earned. If Brandon were to be rude Davidson would have been just as rude. Control the story with your demeanor!!!! Viva humility!!!
It will be 4th fight right guys?
Unexpected wholesome moment. What a guy Moreno.
Brandon, I fucking love u dude!!
The first Mexican style in Ufc
Great men! Amazing examples for everyone around the world.
I really love Moreno what a humble guy and great fighter I hope he becomes champion. This is real MMA you don’t need to trash your opponent talk about family, religion etc these are real champions
TKO from Mexico
I bet on kai but I still cheered for Brandon the whole time
Deus da guerra veio no estilo Tiririca. 😅😅
Simplemente los mejores 🔥🔥
Figgy just casually taking his belt to fights with him 😂
Better than all of WWE SummerSlam. 😆
I see Vin Diesel.  Is it just me?
If only they got paid more
This was weird and awkwardly cringy  The dude should’ve let Moreno have his moment
There you have it.... Mexicans deserve the most respect.
Did I see vin diesel 😂😂😂
Didn't know Joe bonamassa was also an interpreter
Moreno's wife looked so bored during that whole thing 😂
Very Good example of sportsmanship.
Brandon Moreno been listening to Jesse Lee Peterson! AMAZIN'!!
No cap figs crewneck fly af
Damn. This is a fantastic post fight interview.
I love that guys like Moreno and Baddy are taking the spotlight... Ps after listening to Davidson I like him too lol
These guys could fight every month for me.  The quality of their skills, the heart and guts they show. Now the class and respect they display.
Rogan new ahirt white
fucking rogan doesn’t give a shit anymore it’s gonna be a third fight for him
Damn the respect i think this is one of the few fighters who promote their upcoming fight without having bad blood to each other just fighters who just want to fight to get that belt or to defend that belt
Whats with all the boos... stipid crowd
Mexican fans r hater
It's been said before- these two are destined to fight each other forever and I'm here for it.
Moreno has always been a great role model, very excited for this fight
Davidson such a dick for coming in and stealing the show and stealing Brandon’s glory/moment. Brandon was nice and humble and calm as always though. Good win for Brandon and I hope he goes on to win the title.
EPIC 🇲🇽 🇧🇷 🇺🇸
Class!
These two have made the division what it is today!!
Vamos pa brasilll
Cringe
wow momEnt of RESPECT.
Is that Joe... wearing... tie???
Brandon choked up when figgy got in his face 😂😂  Little bitch boy
DAVE BLAKAMOTO making a feature by Figgy. I see you
Class pure class from both of them. The whole World could learn a lot from this exchange. Epic moment!
Figgy is shitting bricks. Moreno is 30lbs lighter than him, and the only thing that's been saving Figgy are the judges.
What's the point of this interim title besides marketing?
Moreno vs figgy  10
Become an example for his close ones. ❤️❤️❤️
Isaid this
This is beautiful
Two champions full of class. I can’t wait for the 4th fight.
Has anyone ever seen a more awkward exchange of handshakes between two guys? 😂 Felt like I was watching the infamous "hug" from that movie, Step Brothers 😂😂
This kid is ridiculous good...Moreno is all class
this shit was wholesome af
Viva México 🇲🇽❤️❤️❤️❤️
beautiful sport
Brandon is a class act!
that interpreter is definitely making BANK. translating in english, spanish, & portuguese.
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
2 legends. Mexico & Brazil have great rivalries
Anyone who doesn't love Moreno as a human being is someone who I don't want to know. What an inspirational young man he is.
It’s like we watched Moreno grow up right before our eyes. That’s what you call a “People’s Champ”!
And everyone liked that!
Devision couldnt help but respect it. Awesome moment.
Moreno is badass 🔥
Man, this is sports. This is our damn loved Sports! ❤😍🙏 God bless.
Nobody deserves to be champion 🏆 like Moreno! He's just awesome 👍
I just fockin love this guys💪🏻💓
Two Legends already in the division.
This is what makes you love the sport!! Love you guys! Keep kicking ass and being honorable!
What a rivalry, and utmost respect to both 👏🏽
That was cool man, love brandon man.
Damn moreno you are anagram role model for us🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️congrats moreno
These two fighters is legends. Can’t wait for December!!
Awesome 👌 moreno
Their rivalry is beautiful. Both great warrior and a good model for everyone, can't wait for their upcoming match. :)
That Brazilian shaking hands with his left.. disrespect FUCK him Moreno showing morals, respect, humility.
.
And dana wanted to kill the 125 division this Is amazing
How can anyone not like Moreno...
I repect these 2 fighters so much. They are jux high level  professional fighters. Too scary, 2 Gentlemen. Respect from🇬🇭🇬🇭
Moreno just took a huge step to become a legend  not only for the win but because of his humanity
Rogan get back the black shirt.
The guy didn’t translate everything lmao 😂 but yh
Opportunity to make this fight a huge ppv and they butt buddied it up. Lame
Very likeable character.
Great game plan by Moreno.  On his first fight against Kai, his game plan was to spam left high kick to break Kai's right hand when he block it.  On this second fight, he's still throwing alot of left high kicks especially on the first round. In the third round though, he faked the high to throw the liver kick and knock Kai down.  He's been setting that up. Respect.
best translator out there !!!
This rivalry will be remembered forever..figi vs Moreno ....Pantoja is really stuck in between😆
🔥🔥
Love how figuereido ducked Moreno and Cara France yet there he was in the front row
What a moment in sport and the UFC
These translators suck
Fucking class
Dude knows how piss away an opportunity 🤣🤣
All I can say is class
Why do an interim fight
As Theo Von once said “the Brazilian winners are always a lil chatty”
VAMOS A BRAZIL!!
That boi is thicccccc! 😂😂😂 how he makes 125 is beyond me
Sudah kuduga! MORENO!!!🔥🔥🔥
bro, Deivison is the most humble wholesome mean guy
Man i love brandon moreno🇲🇽
Why is Moreno to awesome!
so awkward..
Brandon is a legend
Glad to see more of this attitude these days, The best warriors aren't hotheads, they just beat the hotheads cool headedly.
Jeez name a better person on the planet
Fired up Moreno is a menace
Deiveson actually said, "I was not impressed by your performance..."
You really can’t be mad at Moreno that type of personality gives you a humble shield.
Bravo... bravo por ese espiritu deportivo y ese caracter... bien por ambos
1:50 Grito de Moreno 😅
Who them females in white 👗👗👗👗🤔🤔
Some way somehow this was historical.  Has this ever happened before... where a current champ from one weight class stepped into the ring during an interview of a new champ, giving each other props and deciding when the match between those two shall be next?  I don't think I've ever heard of this before
Complimenti Moreno 💚🙌
Wow. I don't know these guys but that was moving as fuck
Can i call it the lego kick
Class act on both of their parts… the sport is already violent inside the cage… good to see they respect each other outside the cage.
Why i love UFC! Gentlemen sport! Good to see!
You can tell Brandon didn't need that translator for portugeuse lol
What a stand up person Brandon moreno is!
1:48 Brandons laugh is funny asf
Great fight 💯💯💯💯🙏🙏🙏🙏💪💪💪💪anyone need ppv holler at me lol
Joe "Mini-Me from Austin Powers" Rogan
Weird rivalry with more cringe moments than cool interactions, but i don't remember any duo like them in mma. They feel like tennis rivals like Nadal and Federer who just play each other so many times, at that point they probably know they're the best guys so well that they can both be confident and prideful enough to be truly friendly to each other. Love to see it
Gonna be another lame ass repeat with him and Fig, no thanks. Getting old
Viva TIJUANA Cabrones 🇲🇽 💯
When Davison came into the octagon, it felt like some WWF $hit. HAHAHA awesome.
And Stil 🇧🇷🇯🇲
Brandon Moreno, Cyril Gane, Stephen Thompson and Robert Whittaker are the Mount Rushmore of the good vibes wholesome fighters.  Special mentions to Max Holloway and Tai Tuivasa.
These two are making this division interesting 🙌
“Figueiredo you absolutely suck” - Brandon “American Gangster” Moreno
yeah, we like that!
Nothing but respect 👍
@moreno talks like the late @eddieguerrero.WWE. is he a Mexican?.(am from Kenya and l loved Mexican such as Alberto del Rio and Rey Mysterio) ...
THAT was some cool, "Warrior shite" on display just then. Great stuff.
That was wild!
This is a fine example that you can still sell fights without throwing trash at each other. Cant wait for December match up between these two gentlemen 👌
why are they booing?
Can't hate after all that time in the cage
Those guys are awesome.
Goosebumps! You got to put some respect on these guys name. Love both champs 🏆
These rare moments when the champ enters the octagon and go face to face with their next opponent on some hype WWE shit lol
Deiveson Figueiredo é um cara muito respeitoso
Great job both, kept the elegance and courtesy. Leave the trash talk behind and save the energy for the octagon. I’m glad to see that . Both deserve the best.
Brandon Moreno is the best in that division in my honest opinion
Ba a ver putasos en Brasil....
Glad for Moreno. Kai was way to cocky
Brandon que ejemplo hermano ❤️
Brandon Moreno 👏
This is friggin great
I WILL BE CHAMPION ONE DAY! I PROMISE!
Brandon has that Mexican fighter heart and toughness
These guys already have one of the best rivalries in MMA and now they have one of the most iconic post-fight interviews!
Wow, speechless,
My respect for the Brandon Moreno
is this the greatest rivalry in UFC history? The forth fight will be another classic?
the assasin
LETS GO BRANDON
I respect this guy so much
Great fighter and perfect gentleman
Vince McMahon boutta sue Dana
Bro this Brazilian Mexican rivalry’s are getting very nice ! And we are all in for it ! 🔥🔥🔥
Congrats moreno 🥳🥳🥳
Brandon is a certified legend
2:42 Legendary momento
Stunning display of mutual respect by both men.
Brandon Moreno is a fkn dawg
Brandon Moreno is my favorite fighter now . humble guys and very respectful
The hype bradderrr
The year is 2038. The World is still recovering after the COVID-19 pandemic; the queen Elizabeth watches Brazil trying to win its 10th World Cup in England, but the home team is confident that football is finally coming home; we're all waiting for Figueiredo x Moreno 19.
El campeon del pueblo❤
Davison Figueiredo ain’t nothing
So many people wish that Brandon would just do some trash talking, but he is unique man! A wonderful human being!
Dont get me wrong I love both joe and daniel, but they are obviously bias against moreno since their first fight they always talk about what kara throwing against moreno but its clearly moreno busting kara face from the first fight. I think they need to be transparent when it comes to commentating fights in the ufc and look again moreno shows who is winner.
Moreno is quality!!
¡¡¡VAMOS BRANDON!!! ¡¡¡AHUEVO!!! VIVA MEXICO CABRONESSS 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Brandon tenía la sangre hirviendo, de todos modos la enfrió como todo un caballero! 🇲🇽
LETS GO MEXICO
This two are turning this division around in a very competitive way we all wanted
Figgy gonna smash him again
Congrats mexico! Boy is a beast
Legendary rivalry
Una cuarta pelea entre ellos dos no estaria mal
Dos hombres en su máxima expresión respeto y todo pero se quiren partir la madre para saber quién es el mejor
Kai kara france kick ass! Even in indonesia he beat all mma fighter here
So these two guys are gonna be the first one’s to have a fourth fight in the UFC? 😆
David knows he didn’t win that fight everyone knows it
Can't believe it
This shows there is no one in this division. They will fight 50 times
Davison from being a cold blood killer to a runner point making casual fighter
Humble guy moreno👏🏻congratulations
Respect to these dudes. They fought THREE TIMES IN A ROW. About to fight for a fourth time. CANT WAIT
Brandon es un verdadero guerrero pero también un caballero, siempre contigo Brandon vamo con todoooo carajo
That was like WWE but in the UFC
how could joe rogan mess up and say third time🤦🏼‍♂️
Man the Thumbnail...shear GOOSEBUMPS🔥🔥🔥🔥!!!
Viva Mexico guey!!🇲🇽🇲🇽 🇲🇽
Brandon and daveison are the Best !! Respect both are champs.
It’s like Hasbulla vs Rosik
That was some hoe shit ! Fig Shoulda left his ass in his seat like everyone else ! BS period ! They ain’t shit for that ! This ain’t WEE wtf let that man shine ! Can’t believe they allowed that 🤦🏽‍♀️
Yo this moment is f****** badass
Moreno became a legend tonight. First from the fight then the post fight interview. Si se puede!
These two made the flyweight division amazing
Damn these two gonna fight each other til the end of time. That's martial arts samurai style, savage with respect and honor.
This is sport about-respect each other🫶♥️
Brandon Moreno el Mejor un Muchacho super humilde lo admiro muchisimo Saludos desde panamá🇵🇦❤🇲🇽 Arriba Mexico
Que aula de profissionalismo e exemplo de bom caráter de ambos
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
"Do you want to fight Deiveson for the third time?" I mean, being the interim champ, you gotta automatically fight to unify. Also, fourth time. Come on, Joe!
Joe "Right to Censor" Rogan
One of the best post fight interviews I've ever seen. Nice one gentlemen. Great job Moreno!!!!
Much respect to these two champion warriors
Best sport in the world
No one gonna talk about David Adesanya casually in the shot😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why do they.ruin this guys moment?
Not a fan of figgy at all but it was nice to see him be respectful and honorable towards Brandon. Two worthy champs showing the utmost respect to each other is more satisfying than any knockout
Some WWE SHI😂
I Really Liked the way This Champions Treat each other, The way The Brother Brazilian Teaches A Good Lesson in Public  to The Public Who Doesn't Feel Respect to The Fighters Who Have Nothing but Respect to each other. Man it Takes a Lot of Courage to Stop a Crazy Behavior of Some of The Fanatics. I noticed The Silence Reaction after Those Strong Word of Power. Something Like That We Need in Today's Professional Boxing 🥊🥊 Some Big Group of People Just can't Understand The Importance of RESPECT to This Hard Working and Highly Disciplined   Athletes.
I thought he was already champion.
Brandon Moreno cada vez se vuelve más y más leyenda.
Both times morano went to dap figgy up, figgy held his hand haha
This is the true embodiment of a martial artist Big respect🫡
Aunque le duela a los jueces y al UFC! 🇲🇽
Brandon never fails to make me cry..
It's impossible to not like Brandon, he's such a good fighter at this point in his career
Y’all are thinkin it and imma say it. That call on Derrick Lewis was BS.
They wanted drama but got 2 Profesionals that respect each other this what the people want to see♥️♥️💯💯🔥🔥
I am so pumped up!!!
Imagine that there was a time when UFC wanted to remove the 125 lbs division
That is respect. That is honor. Seriously eff Dana White for allowing brawls and trash talking to go too far.  This is how fighters should respect each other
Respect!!!
Soooo.. who’s making the heel turn?
Wait, they both have belts. How could that happen? Moreno got interim belt?
Moreno is humble af, love that guy
damn that third fight is gonna be good
Coulda waited for bro to finish his speech lol
Yeahhhhhh! Go brandonnnnn
Good job hope adesanya & aussie clown get smashed ova 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Felt like WWE for a second lol
I am now a bigger fan.  Just wow
And here we go again!
What in the WWE is Davison doing
Pointed kick to liver. Uff, that would have hurt for a few seconds at least. Tough luck for Kara-France. He would have won if not for that kick.
Useless lol
SE LE HACE ASI 🤏 AL FIGUEREIDO CONTRA BRANDON😎🇲🇽
Chad translator
Fuck yeah! Respect to two top killers. 💪🏼🔥
All the Mexican fighters they talk whit they fist 👊
Cry Kara France
Pero nokealo
He was getting pieced up before he dropped him🤣  and we just don't bother listening to their daft motivational family speeches now, we want bad boys not fairy talk
It’s a great day to be Mexican 🇲🇽
Scripted bullshit x10
Ganale cómo le avias ganado
Lmao Kai doing all the mean mugs just to get KOd
Wow couldn't buy fight. Thank u for high light. Top notch character to both these guys.
Watching the interview live felt like this upcoming championship fight is going to be the biggest 4th fight of all time.
very classy for both!
True Champ! Morenooooo
algo bien ,  los mejores brasileños y mexicanos
The FLYWEIGHT DIVISION ladies and gentlemen!
Davison should have pushed Moreno and said, "I can't let you get close."
Kara France has evolved enough to move out of CKB. All they have is Adesanya, Volk represents that gym but that’s not his primary training source or his coach in his off training, he fights out of Australia primarily and trains with CKB and Eugene for a few weeks in his camps. That’s why his style is more aggressive than all the CKB people, he has a different voice in his ear. Eugene holds his fighters back, great technical wrestling defense coach but all his fighters go in with point fighting mentality and only get finishes if it presents it self, they never gas pedal their opponent like Volk does. Adesanya was already a world class kick boxer with different coach’s before his mma transition, and look at how he fights now out of CKB, heavy point fighting poke damage from the outside
Peleadoraso el mexicano
Moreno 🫶🏾
I have a Question Will this be the first quadruple 4th fight between fighters in the ufc history  ?
I can't wait to see these two fight again..
This was worth the ppv buy. Derrick Lewis should’ve knocked out tan Dan for that terrible stoppage
Moreno is a class champion the fact he said I need to be a role model for my daughter I am not going to change for money or views. Hard luck for Kai but he will be back.
A nice wholesome moment between two people who represent an entire country. Respect!
Holy smokes! So amazing 👏 this is awesome and should be a great 3rd fight!
Phumi Nkuta is coming, yo
Manos le van a faltar nos van a pelar la verga🇲🇽🇲🇽
Mexicanos hay k nokear si no pierden
Heart of a warrior. Nothing but respect. Champions inside and outside the octagon.
Great display of class by all three fighters.
Figgy said it best aswell these guys fight for our entertainment and booing a fighter because there fight someone you like is so cringe. It basically turns figgy into the bad guy
couple of fucking bangers, and future Hall of Famers.  this is what MMA is supposed to look like
Tons of respect for Moreno!
I thought he act like brock lesnar
Massive respect!! Both legends!!   Havnt seen this much respect between fighters for a long time and the fact moreno said he wants to be an example, especially with all that adrenaline makes him one of the best fighters in the ufc.
Прикол что Брэндону  дали пустую банку
crazy fight,,, damn i like both
just noticed the ufc has jon jones ranked 11th pound for pound among active fighters.. uhhhh
This was a first. Why bring that dude in the cage?
How can you not love Brandon Moreno? Wow!!!
This is one of those fights that’ll happened in January, again.
lezgo Brandon!
Brandon Moreno is a true champion. More fighters need to take note.
Top 3 rivalry in ufc history
World Class
changing. Amo brandon
I thought it was disrespectful the way they let just let Fig up there and ruined morenos moment
So much tension but respect between them. Exactly what the fans need.
this is way better than any of the trash talk stuff on the pressers, just two people who acknowledge their respective skills and respect each other, Moreno is such a class act and I hope he unifies the belt
Brandon is a fucking legend. Win or lose, his career is FOREVER.
Shame kai lost.not interested in seeing morano vs Davidson again.
ERES GRANDE BRANDON
Yes sir let's get it my guy viva la raza 🇲🇽
Brandon Moreno is the ultimate inspiration 🇲🇽
joe rogan is such a casual holy fuck. "disputed"? figuereido clearly won 3 round to 3, joe rogan doesnt know wtf hes talking about
Brandon Moreno i just became a fan. Wishing you good health.
The king is back … lezzz fckin goooo , viva mexico cabrones 🇲🇽 ( personally think he won the last figgy fight )
2 best 👍
I thought this was gonna be a “these things happen in mma” moment but turned into pure class on both ends
Nice gesture by both the people.
My man baby
I prefer squashing beef and just wanting to fight as a display of pure skill and talent.
NOW THIS IS HOW YOU SELL A FIGHT
🙏🙏🙏👍👍👍👍❤️
O que gerou esse desentendimento entre eles não é o que aconteceu dentro do octogno e sim os casos de Racismo do treinador de Moreno (com aprovação dele) para com o Figueiredo. Racismo, na minha opinião, não tem perdão. Sendo assim, se eu fosse o Figueiredo, eu jamais daria a mão para Moreno. Como um Mexicano morando nos Estados Unidos, Moreno deveria saber bem o que é sofrer preconceito e por isso deveria ter se pronunciado contra seu treinador desde o primeiro instante.
This shit turned into wwe ever since Brock lesnar and Daniel Cormier
I love good sportsmanship.
Mad Respect
did noone else realize Joe Rogan’s a casual who didn’t know they already had a trilogy 1:38
Well come on man There's a reason why god put a ocean between us, respect to both fighters I love when warriors like this cross paths...ik that Manager figgy had was poison I bet he was the one telling him to trash talk to promote the fight.
1:44 Davison I'm right here everybody!!
These two guys can fight till they retire and yet it will never be a boring fight.
Figgy vs Moreno 4, Kai vs Pantoja. Winner vs Winner🔥
What a great dude! Mad respect to both parties!
Shout out to Fabiano Buskei for coming in clutch with the Portuguese translation 👍👏
So why are they fighting if they're such great buddies?
and off we go for 4,5,6,7 fights... until Brandon manages to beat Figueredo, ufc is a joke, doing this fight, nobody wants to see this shit, just casual mexico fans and fanboy cringes
Both of them 🔥🔥
Assassin with golden heart.
Amazing
the translator is back
It’s good that warriors meet and talk when they are not in battle.
Otra vez campeón!!!, el mejor, BRANDON MORENO!!!
Got a lil WWE for a sec there xD
Eres un chingón Brandon 🔥🇲🇽🙏
Love how he was looking for his ass! Bro wants his fucking belt back
And that’s how you sell a pay per view. Tired of all the fake trash talk then hugging and partying together after the fight. Keep it real
Deiveson and Moreno are Goku and Vegeta of MMA
The real champ is figuredos sweater lol
Izzy and volk got y’all thinking kai would win😭
Moreno with a winning performance before that body kick TKO finish over Kai, and now we'll all get to see another spectacular war with the Champ Figgy, I love it!
All class from both men. Love to see that
chunky figgy 🤣
That is one badass Mexican
I don't care I don't care let's go to Brazil, that's my man right there.
Bros a great translator
sun of a bit moda fok
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽💯💯💯
I'm a fan of pretty much any fighter out of CKB but there was no way I could route again Moreno. So happy to see him with a belt again
(Maybe not today Maybe not tomorrow I will be champion one-day ) He is a champion..
How can you not love that dude!! Man he’s the true embodiment of a champion congratulations Moreno!!
🔥🔥🔥
being Brazilian I can say that Deiveson will change for a better person now, he is a very humble guy, but in the previous fight he tried to impersonate for a character created by his manager and coach Wallid (which by the way is the same as borrachinha and that explains a lot) so I think that from now on he will improve, he will train with Charles and be himself instead of trying to impersonate a character
ALL CLASSS
Year 2032: Figgy vs Moreno 15, lesgooo brrrrrr.
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
don't take away his moment to speak, there's a time and a place for a face-off. This ain't no WWE.. We love you Kai! 🇳🇿
I can imagine the look of disgust on Chael's face
Though Kai faked a nut Short cause he grabbed his crotch immediately. But after the reply Kai is a great sportsman and deserves respect.
Brandon go train with the canelo team
Humble pie is the name of the game
Big drama... so big drama 😆
dude's already kinda GOATed
Lame, talk shit make money man. Uncle Chael would be disappointed. Y'all just became a co main event. Be humble afterwards, be like Henry fake it.
Brandon Moreno is a very humble fighter but he is a monster also
True warriors
Izzy and Volk balling their eyes out rn
Funny. Last time this happened was Cormier vs DC. Heavyweights to flyweights, shit was exciting!!!
holy shit what a legendary moment
Come on Moreno. You can't do this to the champ like that. Let him be a villain 😂 he looks good that way. Dammit
All love Brandon
The 4th one. let's go.
When you shake the other guys hand with the opposite hand its disrespectful
Studs and great examples shown by all men here.
Look at kai’s right side body. Goddam havent seen ufc fighters get dropped by body shots.
Bora Deivison,  bora Brasil 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Liver shot was perfect by Brandon 👏🏼🇮🇹
Axandre pantoja!!!
Si fuera como Erik morales ya estuviera tirando madrazos con todos 😂
I'm a fan of this translator!
Men in this world need to understand that THIS is how you behave yourself.
Felicidades a Brandon muy buena pelea
Thought that everyone deeming Moreno as one of the best human beings is over the top but seeing this made me a fan for life.
Usually nobody wants to see 4 fights when it comes to trilogies but damn they bring out the best in eachother. Rivals at it’s finest fr.
Respect and love ❤️
Goat translator!
Wow
What a legend, both of them, wooow...no phoney talks, no shit attitude, just two man out there to fight. 👍
Nice
Actually they both are legend and we should respect then !! 💞🔥
Love this kid. He’s awesome
Love this guy 💯🙏🏿
Moreno had those two rounds. Keep in mind judge Douglas Crosby had Kai up 2 rounds. The UFC HAS to replace some of these judges!
The toughest people are the Brazilians, the warrior people who make the best fighters in the world. Mexicans are Latin brothers but they became soft by being neighbors of Americans! Come to south america you will see those who are real warriors!
Big ups to the security for letting Deiveson in the octagon. What a legendary moment!
Congratulations
Can we please keep the pre-planned wwe shit out of the UFC. I'm not saying the fight was fixed, but the interview was planned in case Brandon won.
Wow Moreno so classy 🔥 awesome performance! Great father and role model. He has some good parents, family, and friends. I like this fighter, and individual. Best UFC EVENT in a lonnnnnnng time. The fights were so epic. Unreal
Yooo you can't deny that Brandon is so fucking chilling bro
Good sh*t!
Deiveson is another man after he dismissed Walid Ismail and started to train with Charles
Shut up lex
To think Dana was going to kill off the division so glad he didn’t 😯
nice!
Lets goooooooo 🇧🇷
brandon is gona ko that guy into retirement 💪🏾🇲🇽👊🏾 vamos puro cachanilla
Brandon Moreno is the guy
If Connor sells the UFC, Brandon sells not just the MMA, but the real thing we all need in this world, love and respect.
Figgy came in all WWE , but Moreno is so love able he had to drop the act . Lmao
Arriba Tijuana, awesome young men, great example respect and good sportsmanship.
respect for both champions
Why are small people so cringey
Davidson é bonzinho demais, tinha q dar uma fritada nesse moreno...
wholesome af ain’t gonna cap 🥺
Just like wwe...adults still believe this ain't scripted. Y'all have zero discernment
Why's joe Rogan wearing that..
NUMBER 4 BABY!!!!!
This is my favorite octagon interview I've seen in a while.
Best UFC post fight interview yet.
Figgy could’ve played the ultimate heel here, but even he can’t manage to hate Moreno.
Figgy🔥
Very likeable fighter lets go brandon
Class!
He works so hard but ufc doesnt help him or give him that extra push
All 3 of these men are a class act I respect them all
Brandon is an example of what is a clean fighter and a role model. 🇲🇽💪🏼
Thank God Moreno won
Nearly started crying in buffalo wild wings when he won. Let's go Moreno!! 🇲🇽
Ppl booing is fucking lame, Brandon just fought his heart out, and figaredo deserve hispect too 😂
Damn kais chest was red as hell
WWUFC
VIVA pinche Mexico 🇲🇽
If Nate can love Moreno so can the world. Always humble definitely my favorite fighter.
How can you feel anything but love towards Moreno?
What a great class from David Figueiredo ALWAYS 🇧🇷👊🏻🇧🇷👊🏻💙
UFC two respected no nonsense fighter. Wat a respect.. This is  the way n life how champions should behave. Respect Bro. 👍🙏🙏
Let's go, two great champions
Perhaps the greatest Champ that UFC kept robbing.
Lightweight champion? Did I hear Bruce right?
FOH with that soft shit Moreno.
so respectful i love him yes
Who's the girl with the red stripe. FFS ego and arrogance. WWF BS. Who let him in the ring. ?  If he got headbutted who's fault would it of been.
Mexico! Mexico! Mexico! 💯👍👊✊️💪
Mfs are gonna fight four fucking times
Shoutout to the translator man, dude was on point
So happy for Brandon! LETS GO MEXICO !!!!!!!!
Let's go baby ✅
Dont disrupt my man assassin baby’s interview.  Good kid
How not to sell a pay per view 101
Boring division
Figgy made the crowd look like fools 🤣
My man was hella professional about that, and setting a good example for his family.
When Figgy came into the octagon I felt like it was getting WWE-y, like that DC and Brock moment 🤣🤣🤣
I fucking love Moreno. Props to Figgy as well.
🇲🇽
Love to see the respect. VIVA MEXICO!
I guess these 2 will fight forever or something
1:05 Brandon has such a positive outlook and its inspiring
I think the UFC forces Figgy to be a heel. He’s actually a nice dude. But two nice dudes don’t sell PPVs I guess
It sucks the ufc doesn’t show the replay of the knock outs. I mean I get it but is only one part of the whole fight. It’s not like there losing money bc of it
Me arrepentiré una y dos vidas de pensar que Kai podría noquear a Brandon. Siempre lo apoye, y con miedo vi la pelea. Pero dios! que knockdown le pego con ese empeine. Un animal; envidia de mis compis Mexicanos con tan alto representante.
Figueiredo didnt get that the boos were for him xD this man is so much fachade and its so fkin lost when it comes to interviews, Brandon is a Fkin Beast VIVA MEXICO CABRONES ❤
Big ups to Brandon and also Figueroa for changing the game back to a respect although we all know the fighters respect each other but sometimes the sell of the fight blurrs the water a little. So fans of particular fighter may take on their attitude towards another fighter so they boo. So big ups to those men for getting back to competition and leaving it at that.  Good s***
Joe Rogan going with the Men in Black look, huh?
Don't get it confused I wana fight!
The UFC needed these 2 to make the flyweight division exciting. These 2 make this division
Congrats Brandon!!!
The fact that he carries the belt around like that is pathetic
Thank god they had THAT guy as the translator
Is Kara-France still crying lads?
All staged theater. This is worse than WWE.
I think Figueiredo intended to provoke Moreno and talk trash but when Moreno displayed respect and grace, Figueiredo also reciprocated. Many of us can learn from this interaction, given today's political climate
Con orgullo digo team palomera team Puerto Vallarta
Moreno still going on about his daughter when Figgy is stood right in front of him holding the belt up, 🤦‍♂ learn to cut a promo dude
Esse Davison é xarope, esse cara se faz de humilde mas não é não, tomara que o moreno arrebenta ele na próxima , sou brasileiro mas nessa luta vou torcer pro mexicano!
Moreno 5'7" Kara France 5'5 someone lyin
Tons of respect for moreno and figgy.
i love you Moreno u r real fighter
the thumbnail was figureido and moreno lol idk if that was a glitch or what but
stand up guy. pure class.
Such a class act
thats champion mindset
Tonight delivered in a big way, and this fight was a huge part of that success.  No one lost tonight, there were only warriors battling warriors!
Lol these guys (brandon and figuereido) have fought so many times that they're pals now
Respect
Mexican warrior.. let's go to 🇧🇷
Boo the champ lol  Hope rematch is a better fight
The cringe was strong with this one
This was some WWE shit  Respect
Moreno champ that chump is going down brother Viva Mexico!
Davidson couldn’t even keep up the evil act after what Brandon said you couldn’t do nothing else but show love n respect💯
Badass
Much Respect for Moreno
Let go!
Brandon already win half of the next fight!
If the ufc ppv happens in Brazil then Procházka vs Teixeira 2 and the co-main event being Figueiredo vs Moreno 4 should happen.
So is Joe Rogan on and off with ufc
I don’t think anyone wants to see that fight again, so Moreno can win and Davidson asks for a rematch.
lol izzy brother just chillin next to figgy
I feel bad for Pantoja  Lmao😂😂
The sportsmanship 👌🏻
Fire moment
Cool badass shit
Shit I had to work and forgot about this card
Imagine what happened if Walid was there 😂😂🤣
Figgy and Moreno are living legends in Brazil & Mexico. We are lucky to be able to witness the trilogy in our lifetime.
This is what Martial is about: respect! Figgy was ready to play the heel again haha but as soon as Moreno put his hand forward, Deivison gave an example of a Champ with his speech. Both of them gave a great example of Champion behaviour, this is how all champs should carry themselves.
Let’s gooo Brandon!!!! 🇲🇽
Que toda la raza le caiga a Brazil no hay pedo! Tienes apoyo en cualquier país assassin!🇲🇽🇲🇽arriba la tricolor pa
The translator is incredible as usual
Moreno is the most humble fighter .. how can u not like this guy
I am happy that idiot self obsessed ego maniac Cejudo retired early. Now we see real humble fighters in the game.
Brandon Moreno is such a classy champion and role model for others.
I was waiting for the flying KHABIB kick 🦅🇲🇽
Always happy to see two fighters show respect to each other.
I thought Moreno want to do the push me now and get slept later thing
Chinga madre guey viva Mexico!!
Awesome man 👏 🇲🇽 felicitaciones Brandon 💪🔥
Dope
This entire segment is legendary...forever etched in UFC history
I had Moreno winning the first and third fight against Devi... so for me it's kinda over. still would be a great fight though.
Very shit
The fact Davidson keeps shaking with his left hand seems shady.
That was so awkward when figuieredo came into the octagon 😂
Glad they could show respect without hornswaggle Cejudo instigating between them.
There Will Be A First UFC 4 Trilogy And This Will Be The Best Rivalries In UFC
Moreno is in the mount Rushmore in BTW history... newsflash... Figueredo is not.
That was the most friendly post fight octagon face off ever.
amazing performance by this two guys, france did very well as well
Class act all around. They tried to make it go WWE but these guys weren’t having it
Davidson on a bulk cycle 💉
I expected a bad ass  call out ,but this was too good of a callout # Respect.
Figgy trying to sell the fight by being the bad guy but moreno shut that down 😂😂
that was amazing i love the ufc 10/10
Love this guys .. and they give an example for generations to come
Moreno speeches are just as good as his fights!!
Morenos coach: what you doing?   Moreno: learning Portuguese.  Coach: why?  Moreno: we going to Brazil 👏😄
I love Brandon I'm so glad he won this fight but I wish figgy had played the heel role (I think figgy is a pretty good dude but sometimes you gotta take the opportunities presented,and Brandon is beloved by fans). If he smacked the mic while Brandon was talking or did something else crazy to hype up this fight to to an even crazier level than already, they both get crazy paydays off this and can laugh about it together when they retire
Man I love to see respect.
He speaks fluent English now too congrats kid
How can you not love The Assassin Baby! Viva Mexico!
yeah this was terrible
Calidad y humildad
Deiveson literally dressed up as a super villain.
That was awesome 👌 classy 👏
Is Rogan a detective now?
Gotta love Brandon Moreno .  a true warrior & a real champion
Such a wholesome moment..
Muy bien Brandon moreno dando un buen ejemplo y respetando a sus rivales. También es bueno destacar la actitud de Figueiredo que se acercó respetuosamente y acepto las disculpas, además dándole la importancia que se merece Brandon en éste momento. Muy bien los dos 👏👏
Chael is punching air right now.
you can still see his footprint on Kara's ribs..
the respect will last about 2 days the figgy will start talking shit again lmao
Such a great moment , that's called RESPECT
The champion has a name and his name is CHARLES OLIVEIRA!
Its pity Davieson didn't understand a word moreno said lol. But hats off to both of them. I look forward to their forth
I want to see Pantoja fight for the belt not this again and again
UFC will give 100 title shots to Moreno so they can enter the Mexican market.
Moreno- classy in victory  Kai- classy in defeat Figgy- classy when he didn't have to be  Amazing
Humble Legends in the octagon. Ready for Moreno vs Figueiredo to have another instant classic 👍👍
GOOSEBUMPS!
You can see the foot imprint in Kai’s ribs
Love this man!
This is turning into a legandary rivalry. They went to war with each other three times with a different outcome every single fight. Their fourth fight must be a PPV main event (based on the entertainment level of their previous fights)
ROBBERY
Jesus Christ is the truth reach out, nothing but respect
Moreno is a class act, all Champions should follow his example.
Even Figgy loves Moreno! Viva Mexico! See y'all in December!!
Are you fucking kidding me???? This is one of my favorite post fight interviews EVER.  Let’s go!
And that’s how a champion handles himself
Where the hell are figgys eyebrows👀
January brazil lets go
Everybody's favorite killer mini man!
Yo he was not ready for this.
Figueiredo punked him
Wow, gonna witness two legends go at it again.   We are lucky
What a card
vamos pa Brazil...arrè
Where all the Kai France fan girls who swore he was gonna ko Brandon 😂🤡
Now that is way better than trash talking, respect and honour amongst fighters and two of the baddest men in that weight class.
With all due respect, let's fucking goo!!!
They tried to turn the post fight interview into a WWE promo and it backfired with sheer class from both guys. Moreno wasn't taking the bait.
The flyweight division has never been more exciting. Sorry Demetrious Johnson .
Kai karaoke
3:12 That was like a movie or WWE segment--  will he or won't he shake his hand.    Storylines make fights better.  This was a great moment
I used couldn't stand Brandon before this fight and I'm not sure why I'm a figgy fan but he won me over today 100% very happy for him.
That was awesome they fought against each other so much.  They got respect for each other now and that's how it should be.
This rivalry is definitely part of the history of the sport
Respect for these fighters is a must
That was a real WWE moment.
Viva Mexico 🇲🇽🇲🇽 perros 🐶
Don't worry Kai. You'll get back up there man. Its just not your time now but stay up and your time will come
Joe was just beautiful in this moment, a moment of Rogan I'll always remember.
Another fight is just bad for business. After Izzy put on another one of those performances it’s becoming clear to me that the UFC is on the decline as far as entertainment. They really don’t have any huge stars anymore. They better hope O’Malley or Paddy becomes a world champ and soon.
Finally, a UFC Title Unification Bout in the near future.
Brandon has the Dope MENTALITY to make a cocky champion look humble. Davidson came forward with a cocky attitude, Brandon transformed him humble
This event was fukin fire!!!!!
Meanwhile Figgy looking like he’s sitting at about a buck 70 right now
I genuinely like Brandon Moreno.
This is changing the whole Let’s Go Brandon to a positive thing!!!
It was destined after the firsts fight that this was gonna be a legendary rivalry.
This is the epitome of real world champions not the BS that that little leprechaun brought to the UFC this is what I enjoy watching this is what real champions are made of not allowed melt disgrace the family name and children you brought into this world along with your wife kind of a guy thank goodness that era will never come back from him now we can get on with real champions showing young people how to be champions not how to be drunken a hoes green little leprechaun type
Based
Really funny how the translator just glides from under the cage to translate this one
Sucks for Kai. He had it. Such a good dude.
Mexico 🫀❤️
Showed strength and determination, Kai Kara France destroyed his whole body, but it didn't destroy Brando's will to win and even then he knocked out Kai in the last round
Viva MEXICO💪🇲🇽
This is what's up. Never gets old seeing sportsmanship and class amongst elite fighters. UFC needs more of this, and we've been seeing it more frequently lately. Legendary Octagon interview right here.
Wwe shit
How tf can you not love merano?
What a history these two have! What a rivalry! We need the 4th fight ASAP
50-43😂 NUNES BABYYYYYY
That's a bad man
1:43 ah yes the undisputed flyweight champ figgy next to the undisputed featherweight champ dave blakamoto
Who's the chick at 3:50 ? 😍
One of the best post fight interviews I’ve seen, much respect for both fighters
Who are those two old farts always in between fighters
The first Mexican born champion (ufc ) Brandon Moreno ! 🇲🇽
Was this extremely awkward for anyone else? No, just me? Ah okay.
Figueiredo is just keeping up the facade, he still have respect for moreno    and he's been hanging with cejudo a little too much
Class act
Brandon mar.
Beautiful, that was amazing.
Brandon Moreno is the Real Hasta La Muerte!!!!
Está pelea fue mejor que la estelar sin duda, dos excelentes peleadores con mucho respeto 👍🏼.
Moreno is a class act 💯💯💯
What a beautiful scene
Vamos Brandon 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🥀
Mexico vs Brazil
I thought Figgy would fight someone else but here we go again, i'm not mad. However I don't want neither  guy to lose but it is what it is. A world breaking 4th first in UFC history with 2 of the best by far in the division! I won't be surprised if Moreno beats Figgy too. The way he ended this fight. Kai was breaking him down then he just woke up Moreno's beast mode and finished his ass just outta NO WHERE. I thought Moreno kicked him in the balls at first (LMAO) till the replay i'm like DAMN, 1 of the BEST comebacks of this year. LITERALLY outta NO WHERE! I got Figgy in the 4th but don't be surprised if Moreno wins with unpredictable shit like this. I got Figgy due to his unpredictability as well and his equalizer: POWER.
Less go Brandon, vamos lo sabia🔥😆
the change of manager did Figueiredo good, Urijah Faber does a great job.
VAMOS BRANDON LA REPUTA MADRE, VAMOS MEXICO, VAMOS LATINOAMERICA CARAJOOO!
This was such a weird WWE moment 😂
Omg.  Beautiful.  Gave me goosebumps.  Love it
Smackdown😂
Moreno>
Classy
watching this live, it was disrespectful watching davidson enter the spotlight on morenos win but their respectful exchange made a humble moment for the archives
Mexicanos e Brasileiros são um mesmo povo 🇧🇷 🇲🇽 💪
Moreno couldn't sell ice cream in July. What a boring interview.
Brandon is a performer man he's never in a boring fight ever
Ay Mexicans are winning 🥇🏆🇲🇽👏🏽💯and he showed respect ✊🏽 that’s right rasa‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Fig is da man :0 his fight destroying Megan olivis husband is my #1 favorite all time  Da giga Chad translator is back 👑👑
That translator is an absolute unit at his job
The sound of that body kick, it's just unbelievable
UFC turning into WWE
That was awesome 👏
Viva México cabrones!
Vince McMahon couldn't have put on greater bullshit himself. What a script.
It's fkn popn in Mexico right now their champ looking like a real class act!
They need to do more post fights like this where obvious title contenders fight the champion
Missed an opportunity to promote a massive 4th fight. They should’ve just blown each other
Badass.
joe rogan got all the money in the world and he cant find someone to make him a shirt that comfortably fits his neck
Fig was gonna go in all hardass heel but reverted to his true soft caring self lol. Henry Cejudo needs to get out of this guy’s head.
Interim for what?
MA FUCKEN MAN LETS GOOOOO
Real Mexicans we are built different! Brandon is a Real Aztec Warrior unlike that pocho Brian Ortega.  Viva México 🇲🇽
Vamos
Both humble
Moreno is definitely getting his undisputed belt back soon, best of the flyweights🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Moreno is a star
The dude is big example and big motivation 🥺
"I don't care, Vamos pa Brazil"
No other interim championship has gotten this kind of reaction and coverage in recent memory.
Both legends Goku vs Vegeta type shit
Love to see this, the translator is top notch.
Par de caballeros 👏👏👏
Viva Mexico cabrones🇲🇽
Dont get it; people say dont bring any wwe shit and then get mad when they dont display fake beef.
En brazil lo va a violar figueiredo. Demasiado Creído el mexicano.
That fight would be dope in favela land <3
What a class act. Salute😊😊😊
0:52 "And see the kick that won you the title". Joe spitting BS and trying to push the narrative that this was for the "real belt"is insane while the real titleholder is sitting alongside the cage. All respect to Moreno tho what a finish.
Definitely will be telling my kids about these 2 legends
🇲🇽🤝🇧🇷
That was such a waste by Moreno and Figgy. Smh   These guys will not be the main event. Once again!
Thats brandons belt trikc. chill out, LEGIT new fav fighter for his morals and fighting heart. LOVE him.
This turned out ok but they probably shouldn't allow it... All these divas are going to want to get in there now.
Fookin hyped baby, smaller divisions are lighting the game up, finally they getting the love they deserve, love the hero villain narrative, even though they aren't exactly fully comitted to the characters, they don't shy away from it either.
Yessir I knew he would get this one. Love the respect they all 3 had in there at the end
There goes the best translator 👌🏻
Figgy can be so awkward sometimes 😂
That kick left Kai frozen like Elsa
What is an intermin champ?
Viva Mexico!!!
This is why I love "The Assassin Baby"   Respect.
Moreno 🔥
Yeahhhhhhhh!!!!!!
Brandon Moreno 🙌🇲🇽 Viva Mexico
Respect..
Figgy, Brandon and Kai are all so wonderful
Maybe they should do minutes of rounds different for each weight class.
this was amazing , low key the best disputed title in the ufc
Dude walked up looking so tough just to be killed by kindness lmao
I expected figgy to be the tough guy and talk lots of crap I’m a huge Moreno fan love to see them come together and show mutual respect love this sport and these guys what An amazing event
Gratz
Figueiredo clearly won the first fight. Anyone that questions that should ask yourself if it's not true why did they fight a 3rd time. Second fight was nothing more than a bad weight cut. Figueiredo is amazing when he's not training under the fake double champ that never beat dj to earn it.
unbelievably disrespectful
Awesome moment
Letting Figgy in there was kind of ridiculous tbh
Si fly.
Too much talking. I wouldve took flight on maluma on god!
Idk why but I find this funny reminds me of a friendlier version of wwe
Thank you for winning me my money, Brandon, and you yours!
Moreno  🇲🇽 !!!
If the fights are close then let them fight 3 or 4 times looks at suga ray Robinson he fought a dude 5x
The 👑 is back !!!
VIVA MEXICO GUEY! 🇲🇽  VIVA PINCHE MEXICO!!! 🇲🇽 🇲🇽 🇲🇽
Bro this was one of the weirdest moments I've seen in the octagon 😂😂😂
This was weird as and I usually love this shit
Devison wanted to go full Henry Cejudo mode but Moreno's humbleness stopped him
No mames guey 😭😂😂
Stopped that boy, there’s levels
Both yall ducking Pantoja
Eso es todo Brandooon! 🇲🇽 quirúrgico  Pd: Figgy le entró duro a las carnitas jaja 🐷
Brandon Moreno, that really is the real champion, go to sleep figueiredo and take English classes, here's a tip.
In Brazil please
I love that figgy is a heel lmao
Interim title situations are almost always stupid, this is one of them but hey, at least they run it back for a fourth time to end their current era trilogy.
sheeeeit this gonna be one hell of a 4th fight
So much hespect
This is WWF level quality
Role model indeed Mr. Moreno.  ... blessings.
Figgy is a tool fr
That was some WWE drama right there lol.
For the first time in UFC history 2 fighters are gonna face each other 4 times. That’s how dominant Moreno and Figueiredo are at 125 lbs. is anybody mad about seeing that fight again..? Absolu not..! Viva Mexico 🇲🇽..!
Honor between warriors
Got some WWE vibes
That was history,fucking amazing
Moreno looks like he's coming for Wonderboys nicest fighter alive title.
Davidson with the left hand shake LOL ... in India, we all know what that means
Cringe.
Let’s gooooo
I thought Brandon should have laid it out there more and called out Figgy for ducking him. But I can respect a man who wants to be a good example for his children.
Love that Moreno is just so Moreno. Very respectful by both guys.
friendship regained with Deiveson Figueiredo
Vamo Moreno!
Would've been a legendary moment if Deivison slapped moreno's hand away, like a movie scene and excellent for the build up.
Pure class, yet it still made the hairs on my neck stand up. I appreciated this and can't wait for the rematch.
Uncle Chael is pulling his hair out watching these two
Gold
Moreno gonna do it!
Figgy owns that boy
Figgy is really a good guy just trying to be a bad guy
So corny
los nopales pican culeros 🇲🇽
Kai handled this loss with a lot of class. I'll be interested to see how he does going forward.
Thought Figgy lost the last fight anyway.
I thought this was gonna turn nasty when Davison walked in but I'm so happy it turned into something positive instead. Legendary gentlemen. Thank you.
Go home pena..Amandas back❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️🥊🥊🥊
Figgy came in expecting to hype up the fight and left loving Moreno even more lmao. He probably was hyped till the translator told him “bro chill he’s literally complimenting you” lol.
Brendon Moreno chempion on the world of king
Respect
Rogan looks so much shorter with a tucked in shirt 😂 he's legitimately 5'1 😄
What a classy fighter Moreno is, the guy has is awesome 👏 I was a little worried when he got that wound from the elbow but I forgot how much heart he has!
Naruto vs Sasuke feels
Brandon Moreno is a dog, true inspiration.
I am brazilian but i think Moreno beats Figueiredo
He is as rrspectful as GSP ever was ✌😳
And still Figueiredoooooo
Man I got mad love and respect for Brandon Moreno. He's the type of champion that you can't help but root for. He's such a class act.
he is ultimate fighter brandon moreno is top💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Brandon Moreno es un señor peleador. Tremenda patada. Un crack!
If it was wwe . After all this bam ..title in the face  of moreno by figgy
blasted him with that kick what a good fight too
Respect earned
I'm Brazilian, born and raise over there. When my ppl give u a left hand to shake it, it means no respect. Lol  Deivison was on killer mode over there in the octagon, ready to kill.  Just a fair play, but no respect
They need to have this 4th fight in Mexico 🇲🇽
Amazing moment! Can’t wait for the rematch!
why have Interim when the champ is well enough to be flaunting in the octagon
This is best thing happened after a long time This Is MMA Respect The Sport❤
The Assassin Baby strikes yet again, he literally deserves all he's achieved👏
They gotta do a trilogy and Moreno will beat him
This moment reminded me of gsp coming inside the octagon and saying "im not impressed by your performance"
Great to see the Kai Kara France dude lose, super unlikeable, him and his twink fans - Great to see him get finished the way he did, great work Moreno😉😉
I can see izzy crying in the corner.
Why an interim champ when the champ isn't injured or out long term?
Giga chad translater
Brandon Moreno is my favorite fighter in the game. I live in Lees Summit where his new camp is, and ran into him at Target with his family. Tried so hard not to fanboy uncontrollably, but he was just so humble and welcoming. He deserves it!
The interview was really great, then with the chad translator, icing on the cake lol
I love what I just saw
Why are they Boeing Davison, he is the champ.
instead of France taking the 3way pic with his teammates, we get to see Moreno do Belt Cheers with Israel again.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I love this guy how he respect other people 😍✌
Figgy is the new king of cringe😳
God I love this kid
Wtf? Out of all the fights that could of had a wwe style post fight it’s Kara France vs Moreno, welcome to the ufc
Con todo el Poder Brandon 💥💥💣💥💣💥💣
Mad respect in this moment if only we could unite like this and set our government to actually benefit us
What a strange post fight interview, what is this bellator now?
My did it 💯💪🏿🫡
Winning in the most Mexican Fashion, Shot to the liver. 🇲🇽
in all honesty, Moreno should of slapped that goofball for getting in the octagon during his interview like its 1995 WWF, looking like Ray Mysterio Jr's little shorter brother.
This is some ONE championship class right here.
Joe Got new job with the MIB
That whats amazing!
VAMOS BRANDON VIVA MÉXICO CABRONEEEEES ❤️🇲🇽❤️🇲🇽❤️🇲🇽❤️🇲🇽❤️
greatest rivalry of all time in ufc
Look at his ribs!! People act like he didn’t damage him! That shit looks like he got fucked up
its sad security has to hold these guys just to have a conversation...sports are pathetic
Figgy sleeps him next time.
Why is Joe wearing a tie and a white shirt? He never wears a tie (it’s a “choke out handle”).
VIVA MEXICO MIS HERMANOS, Y SABIA QUE ESTO IVA PASAR PERO CON TODO ESA BATALLA, ESTOY MÁS ORGULLOSO, VIVA BRANDON MORENO 💚🤍❤️ 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Figgy was walking in angry but then Brandon almost made him cry with that speech
Rogan with that Lex Friedman look
YESSSS
Damn Brandon is a good guy through and through
Ayo fucc DC n Lesnar octagon lame-ass call-out, cuz this is da real one 😂😂
Two amazing Role Models man this s*** is just stuff that makes me happy with tears of joy it just it really does that's what humans are right there that is amazing s*** that's amazing sportsmanship that's great conduct I really appreciate that way them guys are then people should be those two kids right there should be the face of the UFC absolutely
How can u hate Brandon Moreno !! Si se pudo! Viva Mexico 🇲🇽
Brandon is too wordy lol let's get to the point buddy thanks
They remind me of old school boxing with their draws, wars, blood, guts, razor thin wins and now the first ever quadrilogy.
I can't wait for Quadriology Title Shot between Figueiredo vs Moreno and Pantoja waiting to fight the winner Quadriology Title Shot or the winning between Pantoja vs Askarov (if they fight each other) can fight for the Title Shot  Anyway this translator is fucking great
The stars were aligned for an unforgettable promotional moment here.... I've already forgotten what happened
I like the idea about the 4th fight now
The hype train huh?
Class act by both fighters…🙏🤝 can’t wait for the bout.!
Both fighters did have a great fight but Moreno did a better job
The mark that kick left damn.
Tonight, Brandon Moreno proved he is the best fighter pound for pound and it's not even close.  He made all us Mexicans proud.  He showed his corazon.  We as Mexicans are alpha lions and the toughest people on planet earth.  We fight, we cry, we love this is what it means to be Mexican.  🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 FOREVER!
This is so weird but so cool!!
Figgy wanted to be an asshole but he was touched by the apology lmfaooo
Should’ve let Brandon have his moment
Moreno went beast mode and won.
Figgy almost forget he lost to his  Lmfao
Morano is great role model for up and coming athletes . I’m a fan.
Figgy needs to move up, looking thicker and thicker ever time out.
What a great example Moreno is to the sport. Hope you get your title back in the next fight !!
I'm so happy for Brandon M
nice
The real champ 🇲🇽
Ahuevoooo❤️
That went way better than I thought it would but both these guys have ton of respect for each other. Next fight should be special
The fact that he keeps in the back of his mind that he needs to be an example for his kids at all times as a professional and humble person speaks volumes about his character.
Moreno will get the title back fuck figadoodoo he got lucky and was awarded the title back to him.
Love to see it
I need to learn Spanish…. That’s is Spanish isn’t it? 😂😂
Figueiredo VS Moreno 4 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Old time boxing vibes with this call out. Epic stuff
tough day for nz
mexico hijo de brasil en tudo
great for Moreno tough for Kai. Game of inches
This is the division where the champ and the interim champ are evenly matched. Figgy and Moreno can fight the division on their own.
Shocks the world again
Lets gooo!!!!?? Send me location
I don't care.... vamos para Brazil xd  gotta love spanglish
The Assassin baby left his mark with that body kick
Well this was a first
NOW THIS IS UFC no pussy just people fighting their lives
That handshake. I wasn't expecting that. My favorite part of the sport.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯💯
Look at David
❤❤😭😭💯💯
Dana book this fight in Brazil🇧🇷 & DM me the ticket price
It's great to see two excellent fighters show respect to each other and just get out there and put it all on the line. The better fighter will win and that's that. That was a class act by Brandon and Fig came back with the same respect, good job. Can't wait until they fight again.
This is fucking legendary
Joe Rogan looks like an icecream cone
This needs to be the last fight with Moreno and Fig.   It'll be the tie breaker after all since the first fight was a draw.
Figgy shoulda smacked Rogan for disrespecting him on the broadcast earlier tonight.
These guys going tear the roof off! Again! Pay these men top dollar ! And the translater is always on point
El nació para este negocio increíble
So proud of Moreno such an honorable human being.. Kai will have his shine .. good fight guys
LET´S GO BRANDON!!!
GET A ROOM!!!!
Love this man
🇲🇽🇧🇷🇲🇽🇧🇷🇲🇽🇧🇷
That was one of the most brutal liver kicks I've watched
Brandon is the real champ!
history in the making
FIG IS GOING TO END MORENO THIS TIME 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Major respect for Kai for putting up a fight 💯.
I knew his eye was going to be split bad. Was worried about dr stopping it all week.
Early gang
Brandon Moreno, Brazil! 👈🤠✌️😏
Some legendary stuff
Congratulations champ! Love this dude.
Dana needs to pay both these guys the money they want! Everytime Brandon fights people love him and go crazy for him! These two have put on three great fights!
What a epic rivalry between Moreno and Figgy
Look at that scar on kai's abdomen goddamn pinpoint accuracy by Moreno in that kick and a great comeback too 👏🏻.
Moreno just made his next big payday. Good for him. Too bad for Kara-France, but he did well. The margin for error at that level is nil. Moreno is a beast though.
Se lo chinga Brandon Moreno como las ultimas tres peleas.
LETS GO MORENO
LETSGOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
The fight in Brazil is going to be insane!
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Jagoan gw nii
Class and Respect.
Definitely don't think Braden should be fighting for the title before pantoja
This is one of those moments in history boys. Legends. 🏆
Bold of that man to show up knowing very well Brandon can spank him easily, been ducking him
SI SE PUEDE!!  VAMOS BRANDON MORENO  VIVA MÉXICO 🇲🇽🐍🦅🇲🇽
I love that they don't actually have a Bad blood those are just 2 guys doing their work and i would love to se the fourth fight
He’ll lose it again hahahaha
The MMA Gods answered our prayers!
That ending felt like the WWE. A bit lame. But congrats to those who fought
Yes sir
This division is never going to evolve beyond these two.
Ahuev viva México  cabr ones
Figgy wanted to put on intensity then he got shutdown by the power of 💕 love 😂😂😂
I m so glad arrogant little guy Kara france lost. Brandon Moreno is a super nice guy and probably the best in this division.Very happy for Brandon.
Moreno is a beast on another level I think he beats figgy and wins the undisputed title again.
LETS GO BRANDON!!! VIVA MEXICO CABRONES !!!  Brandon & Deiveson best rivals .
Look at the right side of Kai, that kick was brutal
Moreno is the man!!! Such a good guy
so proud of brandon! he’s gonna be champion again
One of the greatest post fight interviews I've ever seen in UFC
Kai kara France ❤
I can’t wait for the first ever quadriology in UFC history! It’s gonna be amazing to see our best flyweights at present go at it again🎉🙏
Deep down we all knew he was gonna win it..
Brandon !!!!!! Viva Mexico Alv
Genial Brandon 😁😁
nice‼️
Wow the real main event was indeed right here🔥Absolutely loved our crowd and my mexican women for this one. I am so happy for my man Brandon but i really was rooting for Kai to win it for his country. Really unfortunate he really looked like he was getting better as the fight was going but Moreno is just a killer i am really proud of him much love and hope Kai will be back stronger than ever❤️
