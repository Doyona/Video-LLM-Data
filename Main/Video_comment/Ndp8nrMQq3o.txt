Vermont
I saw shovel able snow in the morning of June 8 in Fort Kent, Maine.  Maybe 30 years ago.
For my 2 sent worth,as a otr driver,I don't wont to see any snow any where anytime!!!!!!
Right Now I'm Getting Sun Burned.
I hope we get some snow in NC this winter we haven't had any in NC for two years.
You mean 1.3.25 right???
My prediction for this winter is ice storms here in Western Carolina and then forest fires in the spring
What about North Carolina
RYAN  I love your Video's but this one was done 11 months ago???  Why dont you remove that?

Pull your old posts!! Old posts  do no one any good!! La Nina is going to be this year's  weather!! Old  posts  do  no one any good!!
Pull your old posts down!! La Nina is going to be this year 2024!!
Welp, we got ours 2 weekends ago!  Jan 15ish. ❤
It snowed here in Nyc and it sticked! Havent seen this amount of snow in years, sure it wasnt feet of snow but still more than the past couple of years.
I disliked it cause I'm in Nashville and came back to say you were 12 days early from the 8 inches of snow we got this year.
i’m in nashville and our snowfall happened on Jan 14 😭😭not sure about the snowflake though
Clarksville, TN here! First recorded snowfall is January 14, 2024! 🎉🎉🎉
Tulsa just hit first snow jan 8-9
Hey Ryan, snowfall has yet to happen here in Nashville…so that Jan 3 prediction was a no go 👎🏻 However thanks for keeping us safe during the recent tornados 👊🏻
Well Ryan, its a little past 10:33 pm on Jan 3rd 2024, and there is no snow at the Parthenon in Nashville TN, hope next years prediction will be spot on
8:38 Well Ryan… it’s January 3rd 2024 and NO ❄️ in Nashville. It’s cold but no snow. I was hoping you would be right 😕 now I have to dislike the video 😢
I live in the greater Nashville area (Lebanon), and unfortunately, we did not have the first snow you predicted. I’m not mad about it though! 😅
Hey Ryan I am headed near and Nashville as I am texting and I also have family there too. It is very cloudy and gloomy so it is a possibility for snow. The Temperature is not too cold as of right now. I can keept you updated but you are on point!
Not looking promising for the Jan 3rd Nashville prediction @ryanhallyall
Just coming back to this video to say you nailed it in my area (Springfield/Branson, MO). 😂
Pretty accurate! First snowfall in the STL suburbs is happened right now at 11:35 AM on December 27th.
Well here in Charleston w.v. the 18th of December and we had our first snowfall with bout half a inch ...you called it.... may of been off by 3 days but that better locals
Reporting in from Bloomington, Indiana!  We're in the usual Dec. 1 window (though very close to the Dec. 15 region) and we just got our first flakes tonight, Dec. 18!  ~2 weeks later than usual, just as predicted!
You nailed it for KY. Estimated after 12/15 for first snow fall.  It’s 12/18 and the first snow fall is currently happening.
As usual turned out to be completely wrong.
Oh my lord! Ryan you were very corrected about our first snow event. I live in central Virginia and our first snow event was December 11, 2023 (between Dec 1 - Dec 15). Awesome job and great prediction🫡👌🏾
nah that's crazy your right
#wrong
NC ain't getting any snow, didn't get any last year and I'm sure we won't this year.
Nailed it, Boise had first measurable snowfall December 1st!
I was expected to start snow on dec 1 but I got it on November 28th!
This doesn't help
First snow in Sedalia, MO today. (11/26/23) Ryan Hall Y'all forecast: after Dec 1st Off by about a week. It was only about an inch, but first snow is first snow.
Everyone hes posting videos for clicks, and i got a little snow last night
To those guys Texas you're on the center of both that amazing
You were almost 100 accurate on when I should see snow. You said I will see it around nov 16 and I saw the first snow today!
Pretty good! Central NH got 3 inches on the 9th of November. Just remembered this video and decided to come back, and see how you did!
I like your style. The mixture of humor but also the very intelligent and detailed explanations. No wasted time and nothing corny or not too corny anyway. Subscribing!
First snow in southern Maine on November 9 :) not too far off
we just had an 80° november day….
Southeast Michigan had its first snowfall this year on November 1.  Weather forecasters are about as accurate as Nostradamus.  AFTER an event occurs, find evidence it was going to happen.
We got 3 inches in Cleveland Ohio on Nov 1. Sooooooooo......looks like the weather remains unpredictable.
Dead on for Western New York. First snow was on November 1st!
Here in Helena, Montana we got our first snow on October 24th, it was about 4-5in at 6am October 25th. I was told we usually get our first snow in September.
Morgantown WV had our first snow on Nov 1st, so about 3 weeks earlier than the prediction (prediction was add a week to Nov 16th)
For the record, Chicago, IL got measurable snowfall on Oct 31st, over two weeks before your prediction of Nov 16th. Time for me to get my Y’all-o-meter order in! 😊
Just so you know, we saw snow in northeast Ohio already. It snowed October 31- November 1. I am not mad, just disappointed.
Lit up the like button. My manz😂
Here in Pittsburgh we got our first snow on Nov 1st
December 15th is the first snowfall in Oklahoma???   I'M SO READY FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.
Northeast Ohio here.. we had our first snow yesterday it showed up early 😁
Ryan - I’m one of your fans from Northwest Vermont. Right at the 2:05 minute mark of this video you predicted that my zone of your weather map would receive the first snowfall between November 1-15. Well, yet again you are spot on correct. St. Albans, VT had its first snowstorm early afternoon today, Nov 1. First flakes of the snow season. Was a dense snowfall that lasted about an hour. Most of it melted because the ground is still above freezing, but it was a beautiful snow event. Excellent data-based predictions as usual!!
We just had snow here in Ohio on Halloween
update: Greater Cincinnati (OH, IN, KY) got its first snow on 10/31.   But No accumulation
Nov 1st,   When prediction Nov 16th.  so close
Well - Cincinnati, Ohio got our first snowflakes last night! Not sure what you class as "first snow" - but it was freezing and snowing as we were trick or treating!!! @ryanhallyall
First snow, Chicago, October 31, HOWEVER, it will be in the 60s by the end of this week
First big show southwest Ontario, October 31
Cincinnati got some flurries today🎃❄️
You were wrong in this video
Chicago got flurries today, October 31st! 🙃
Snow in chicago toady OCT 31st
October 30th Near Paynesville Minnesota, we go the ground including the road covered with a sheet of snow.
Just snowed for the first time here in the Twin cities. 10/30/23 at 9:34 P.M central time.
I'm from southwest Michigan and seeing our first snowflakes right now... you can put us down for 10/30/23! ❄️
Very different is correct, but the snow actually hit earlier than usual here in southern Wisco!
I just moved from Texas to Boston. I’m trying to mentally prepare myself for the snow. I love snow but…😂
I watched this a few weeks ago. Now I’m flying back to Omaha, Nebraska with snow forecasted for Sunday. It’s not even November. So much for 2 weeks behind.
Came back to this video. In northern Idaho, and we see our first snow today October 25.
Spokane Washington, first snow today, not measurable yet, but the flakes are falling.
Who's ready to start their fireplace
I’m so ready (New Englander) I just bought an Audi with the Quattro system lol
Predict Mississippi snow for Katherine please
Hoodies are on and in place 😂❤
Southern Indiana cold and wet Halloween with November 1st lows at night in the 20's yikes ❤
I enjoy this channel but the long range weather forecasts change constantly. First it was forecast that we would have a colder weather than usual this year. Now it's  forecast the weather will be warmer this year.
Hello all, if I heard right? We should see snow around Nov 1st - 16th? Im in Buffalo, New York.
I live in nashville
Hi Ryan you were right Virginia did see some snow in higher elevations  on Monday Mt Rogers
im a landscaper and we all place bets on first juicy snow. watching these vids feels like cheating
Already had snow in the smokie mountains 🫶✌️
People need to stop watching this crap. He’s never accurate and everything is a dramatization.
When the solar eclipse passes the southern tip of el ninio and hits the warmer pacific cold zone it "could" affect the warmer climates off the eastern coast ???? Maybe!
I know it's early but I'm hoping to see a white Christmas
Can you do a video on where the best snowmobiling will be this year. As far as weather goes in the midwest this is all we care about in the winter.
Here in Nebraska it’s usually Halloween
Oklahoma
Slow down you got one full minute to explain it to me and I'm gone
October 16th, 2023 for Appalachian Trail area in Western North Carolina (specifically Jackson, Swain, and Graham counties).   Soooooooo not December 15th lol
You've got to be KIDDING!! Come to Australia. It just doesn't snow EVER!!                        There's a small hilly area (hardly mountainous from a Canadian point of view) and there's some snow from a snow machine. (If you hurry up) and parents take their kids to see what  this snow stuff looks like. Also you won't have to put up with all those crazy pollies.         nuff said
Nashville.....10:33 pm Jan 3....I'll be back when we see it❄️❄️❄️💝
I feel like you all ways leave our New York. You focus on the mid west. The mid Atlantic doesn’t get much coverage. This is for your snow average to other events too.
Thank you for recommending Visisolar! I was able to see and take a picture of the solar eclipse today, even if it was just 80% 😄   I’m excited to use it in April for the total solar eclipse 😆😆
Students be hyped
WHY NOT TEL US SNOW FOR GA
So I live in sw iowa, I'll let you know our first measurable snowfall. Which according to your prediction should be between Nov. 16th and Dec. 1st 👍🏼😀 fingers crossed your right I love the snow!
I think i got more educated and entertained on this youtube weather channel then the actual weather channel lol
Is Kansas from gonna have snow?😢
I live outside Chicago and would rather not have a lot of snow. Last year was great. We really had nothing. 👍
Thank you Ryan hall yall just subbed have a wounderful weekend
Oh Ryan I'm a weather weenie from Nashville there's no way I'm going to forget that you made this bold prediction, and I hope you're right😂
Loved the sponsor and was trying to grab some classes but the website won't let me checkout 😭
We’ve been getting snow in the southern Cascades of far Northern California for several weeks. A bit of snow last night down to about the 5,500-6,000’ elevation.
🌩🌭🎉
Every video he says the same shit "this winter is going to be VERY difficult", "this summer is going to be VERY difficult", "this spring is going to be VERY difficult",  "this fall is going to be VERY difficult" like dude how many times do you have to repeat yourself
Dallas texas
Not sure this is very accurate, because it’s already getting abnormally cold up here in the Midwest, I’m thinking it might snow earlier this year
It usually snows in edmonton on oct 31st ..it's been like that for years now ..
what are you considering "1st snow".. Sure we've "saw" snow in november last year in NH but ...2 days later it was 70 and we didn't see anymore untill January...unless you are just saying "saw" in general. Like on top of Mt. Washington. Then sure we "see" snow in November....Most of us have been able to golf almost up till Christmas last 3 yrs in a row...
Based on your prediction for weather in Feb.'24, we cancelled our trip to Kissimmee FLA!!! of course after you, others were doing the same...
Mathew 6:24 Revelation 22:12-13 Jesus is coming!
In Denver it’s still 80° every day and the month forecast (which I know isn’t necessarily the most accurate) shows that we won’t have a high lower than 45° until mid November
Already got snow on some peaks the last two or so weeks in Colorado. Ready for it to start accumulating. Hoping to wake up to some tomorrow!!
This was fun even when you called me a weather weenie.  I feel called out. 😂
New Hampshire was colder than he'll this summer and wetter
South dakota here, we are used to Marylands 44 inches of snow. 😂 my motto is always be prepared.
ill keep a look for it as i live in Tn
My fingers are crossed so hard it hurts for a record breaking snowfall in Central Minnesota! Been a long time since Minnesota had a historic snowfall
Yay!!🎉 I made it to weather weenie!! I always wanted to be one!!🤩
Do you think Maryland will get much more snow this year? Because for the last several years, we have gotten robbed by a lot of snow and we are long overdue for it and we have not had a good snow storm since winter storm Jonas. And that was 2016. *It's been too long!*
So, what if you don’t live in the blue or brown?????
I don't want it. But Pittsburgh hasn't really had much snow the last two years actually.  I bet last year we had maybe 8to10 inches the entire winter season.  I could be wrong.  But we definitely don't get big storms like we use to
Saw our first snow while camping in the northern Rockies on Oct 3rd. Just a trace but nice to see in Moose country.
I really hope we have a great winter this year in Nashville TN
Im currently in Western OK.  They're actually predicting, by Farmer's Almanac, that we could see snow as early as November 10th or 15th, and far above average than usual! 😳
So in I’m from Brownsville tx and the snow is a 1% chance cause in the summer ants hot a lot
Thanks for this! Loved it! Please start saying “twenty” instead of “two thousand and…” for the year, it’s so much easier! And rolls off the tongue so easily ever since we hit twenty ten! 😂
Well it's Oct 10th and still no snow, average is Oct 2
I’m in Ct on the coast close to NY & last year we got about a dusting of snow. Maybe 1 inch. If that. It was the weirdest winter I’ve ever seen. I remember growing up. Winter was wild. We even had real white Christmas. I haven’t seen a white Christmas in forever! So many snow days that the school year got extended. Last year they gave away snow days without snow 😂
i’m in nashville so i’m watching 👀
you’re gonna be wrong about this again
Do you expect the warmer than normal northeastern snow/weather will lead to worse storms later in winter due to the lake temperature staying warmer longer? - Sincerly person living directly next to Lake Erie...
As someone who’s lived in Massachusetts my whole life, this honestly makes me exited. Usually we don’t see snow till January, besides that one year we got it on a Halloween. All I want this Christmas really is snow!
It's been here for about a week...(Fairbanks, Alaska)
Utah did have early snow. I'm a snowboarding instructor, we got a few inches up high. Super duper excited, I cannot express how happy I am to see more "sooner than normal" snow forecasting! All hail the powder buoy!
Nice! So hopefully there might be snow on my birthday!
Was lucky to live in the path of the last Midwest total solar eclipse in 2017. Quite a sight to see
Yeah we got snow in Utah 2 October.
North Dakota: cold
How about northern Georgia??
Last eclipse I got a chance to see we wound up using a welding helmet replacement glass at work
Love it, give me all the snow all the time..i should just be in the mountains of Colorado, Montana, Etc.
I don't remember it snowing last year on MD eastern shore.
I live in Nashville. I’ll let yall know in January
Im so thankful I live in southern Texas. We dont get any type of major anything. I dont need to board up windows, I dont need to have a shelter, I dont need to have snowchains, I dont need to hide under desks, I dont need a jacket for our winters,   I dont need anything but my front porch, a chair and a beer to watch a thunderstorm or two roll by. Love it!
Not a fan of winter.  Despise snow.
Just casually skipping Alabama
Can confirm that the Wasatch Range has already had snow.
I just wanna go snowmobiling in Iowa😭
Well done Ryan, appreciate your gift of meteorology and "broadcasting".
No southern Texas snow….again….😔
You forgot to mention Cleveland Ohio for the northern cities or do you not like ohio
Living in Tahoe we always see our first snow that sticks sometime before Halloween. But we've already had our first snow about 2 weeks ago.
Hey if you want to know if your the best come be a meteorologists in Colorado.
I hope where I live gets a big daddy snowstorm I would love to get 6 ft of snow
ive already seen snow here in utah up on the mountains for like the past week
Cincinnati gang 👇🏾
Nov 16 yay
LMAO IM A  WEATHER WENNIE !!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What nonsense
I decided to watch because I just saw flurries of snow here In Ohio, it is gonna be an interesting one this year!
Tyler Texas is in the sporadic and, December zone, do you have a estimated guess for us ?
@2:13 "as early as October second" Have never been in the Rocky Mountains Ryan? I am not sure what they tell you flatlanders, but it snows in Colorado just a bit earlier than you think, our mountains have been covered for almost a month.
I really do love snow in Rhode Island but I hope nothing serious m
I'm in idaho and have been saying we got up to a month before we see snow...
Hartwell ga
Why don't you include Alaska? We are curious what you have to say for us and we are a part of the USA. Our weather patterns do effect the lower 48 as well, correct?
Nah, S. Indiana will be mid January. Anything before it sticks doesn't count. 😂
So I may not have a white Christmas on the Cumberland Plateau in Middle Tennessee! Or will I because I'm at 1200ish feet? I need specifics!
I agree with most of your points, but i fear this one is dangerous. I am personally gearing for a bad, early winter in the northeast. These Great Lakes are already pissed off, & generating lake effect rain storms. I think this will be one for the history books. 🙌🏼
By this graph, where I am it might start around my birthday (November 16th)
If your wrong ima find you
My lady literally called me a Weather Weenie. Only could respond with... well, if Ryan says so 🤷🏻‍♂️
saw snow flurries last night   but only in higher eval
i wanna seee snow bomb hit dunkirk ny . this year . so far i believe it could come this year . SNOW TOWN BABY .
i saw  snow  in jamestown ny  heavy  during halllowween.oct31 do not remember the year .
I live in the California Sierra Nevada and we already got our first snowfall on exactly October 1st interesting enough. It was only a dusting and was gone by the Next morning.
I live in central Maine. Should I waste my money registering my snow sleds again this year?
I want to make sure people understand before looking at the eclipse THAT YOU CANNOT LOOK AT IT WITH JUST SUNGLASSES OR NO GLASSES  It will damage your eyes, you need to have the solar eclipse glasses he mentioned. The only time you can take off the glasses is when it’s a complete black out. Please don’t ruin your eyes! people make this mistake too often.
I love in Northern Virginia - can't wait to see measurable snow!!!!
My daughter and I used my son's welding helmet to watch the last eclipse. And even took some really cool pictures using my cell phone from inside the helmet.
Haven’t got really bad snow in New York in a while hope we get some
Here in Utah, we've already had snow.
Flagstaff!!! First
We got snow in Mammoth CA last weekend
You are so funny funny and  I love your prediction.  Can you pretty please send some snow to SC? ( lol ) Greetings from a German out of SC. 😂
Hey what about Kingsport tn lol  Oh if your that good in the tn hood🤣👊🙌🥰
Hope Michigan has a solid winter this year, the past few years have been really dull just cold and grey outside no snow
November 15th, east coast snow,....yeah, I'm calling it!
I’m hoping to use my Ryan Hall Snow Meter this coming winter ❤️
“Sporadic”/who knows in my area. Naturally 😂🙄
Is VisiSolar a legit business? I ordered glasses and they won’t send me a USPS tracking number even after contacting them and requesting one. VisiSolar only responded that my order should arrive 3-5 days after shipping. They did give me a shipping date in their reply, but no tracking number. Nothing shows up when I try to use the Shop tracking link in my confirmation email. Maybe I’m not using Shop correctly, but I started getting sketchy vibes. I checked ScamAdvisor and it identifies VisiSolar as “may be risky.” @Ryanhallyall, I hope you did your due diligence in assuring that your sponsor is legit because I ordered because I trusted you.
I live in Smyrna Tennessee and I’ll be sure to come back on January 3 with an update lol
I ordered 2 of the eclipse glasses the day you posted about them with your discount code. October 7, they still have yet to arrive😢. I hope they get here before the 14th. I can't seem to locate anywhere that it says where it's being shipped from. Anyone else?
Florida wooooo no snow lol
We’ve already had snow here in California a week ago
I really love how you break down past weather patterns and changes in climate!
I’m in Missouri… with 4 different COLORS IN IT?!?!? So November-Feb I’ll see snow LOL
🎃
I am desperate for any sort of precipitation right now. El Paso TX had such a long heat streak and tough summer.  I'll take anything we can get!!
Great video! Can you do a video about some of these crazy random blizzards we’ve had here in Illinois? That Thing they called a “Snow-Thunder” where it snowed for almost 30 hours and shut Chicagoland down for the first time in 40 years. I am a total nerd for random facts!
Your thumbnail is exactly what happens literally every year m***n.
I did not grow up around snow. I don't know how to drive in it. But I have to drive to central Colorado in a couple of weeks. Needless to day this video has put me in panic mode. Great video, btw. I'm just scared now lol.
I’ll keep an eye out for ya in Nashville, Ryan.
OK OK im a damna weather weenie you dont have to tell everyone now HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA love your stuff dude keep up the good work i can trust you more then the weather channel lol
I live in Nashville and if you’re right I’ll buy you a snow cone!
I’m crossing my fingers for NC snow! We rarely get anything 😫
Im a weather weenie and proud of it you got that right Ryan 😎
I'm 24 and have lived in MD my whole life. In the last few years we have seen pathetic amounts of snow. The snow will fall in the AM and be gone by the PM of the same day.   If an "el niño" winter created the crazy 2003 and 2016 snow storm, then hell.. BRING. IT. ON! Ik it's expensive and fucks shit up, but we are due for some good snow god damnit!
brodie practically solved global warming 😂
The strong southern winds have changed Maryland's winter landscape, which has enough strength to push the N.E part of the jet stream more N.W. of Maryland.  We end up being outside the frigid cold of the jet stream, it's more dramatic when low pressure moves in from the west.  We have clear cold nights, then it rains when low pressure approaches from the west, even in the dead of Winter.  The heat from the south pushes the jet stream just outside Maryland''s reach, but only during low pressure from the west.  Been this way for at least 5+ years.  Just my theory.
I remember seeing snow earlier this year in January.
Are you taking in reduced solar activity in your calculations?
Everyone meet there lol
And I will let everybody know if you happen to have a welding helmet or Hood laying around that works very well too
We love you. You tell it like it is. Is there any snow that may come around November 14th going into November 19th in and around Branson Mo and also around Charlevoix and east jordan Michigan around the same dates.   ???????
I hate florida. I want pretty falls, and cold and snowy winters.
Here in utah there is already snow in the mountains
Will New York get some snow this Christmas??
wonder if instead of snow storm, itll be more like an ice storm, went through one in the early 2000s, knocked out power for weeks, so hope not
We're in the blue area in NC, and most years we get zero snow.  Then we'll get one that's a few inches at most.  The first, and only, snow is usually in February or March.
I,   asked   God   for   2   years   of   a  mild   winter.  and,   I  asume   others  did   the   same.   🙏
I’m in New Jersey. When do you think we might see your first snowfall and how much do you think we will see in this region?
Good its about time hate these oppressive Florida like summers now in ct nasty sticky shitty mgritty and  muggy buggy garbage weather in the northeast right now in October needs to go now 30 years ago it used to be cool dry summers growing up not this up and down heatwaves that start in march that go until October thats not normal the climate is in hyperdrive and warming oceans are screwing up my fall weather and spring weather seasons now 100 % and only getting worse hopefully this strong elninio and solar hybernation will give us some polar vortex and snowy weather this winter to cool the northeast down thats on fire and cooking us to death with Florida like summers now in 2023
Here we go huge snow predictions every year and boom nothing happens
8:02 we’re in the weather weenie hut lol
You are the Alton Brown of weather
I have been watching these videos for a year or two now. Of course, Ryan never gets things right. No meteorologist ever does. BUT, I really like his presentation style and the possibilities he gets his viewers to think about. Definitely not accurate, but definitely fun!
Your Always Wrong Dude !!!
I’ll be back to let you know👍🏻
What is winter forecast for southwest Harlan Kentucky
Big sky, Montana - we got our first snowfall October 3rd, a few days ago. So very accurate !
In many cultures, it’s considered very bad luck to watch or go outside during a solar or lunar eclipse.
You and the bulls have a falling out ?
Funny talking about the guy selling the glasses in parking lot.    So what’s that make you for buying from him 😂
Lol love your prediction but I’m not in Nashville. What about Lupton Michigan?
Question as someone whose followed you since I lived in the states and very much appreciated your coverage of the hurricane in Nova Scotia. That being said. If you were to say when the first snow would be coming for Nova Scotia what would you say.
Living in the gray zone. We had snow fall end of September this year. It’s melted since then but it’s happened
I was just looking up videos of the eclipse path to watch after this, and when you started talking about the eclipse literally 30 seconds later it made me smile🤣
Ok I live in Nashville and I hope you are wrong.  Jan 3rd is my sister birthday and the day before mine.  It would spoil things for my birthday week😁.  I hope it’s later next year like the end of February 2024, 😂😂 or not at all 😁
turn to Jesus Christ he loves all of us more than anything and he literally died for us. He took in the punishmrent for our sins thru  on the cross. It wasn’t cuz we deserved it, but cuz he loved us. 1 John 4:10 “This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins” it was thru his love that he died for us and we can be forgiven
Love your channel, Ryan!  Such a caring human with all that your squad does - good work!
im from houston and im honestly hoping for some snow this year
Half way through our vacation in Outer Banks and hurricane Ian arrives and I’m not gonna lie I was very concerned. So much all     Family back in Pennsylvania were begging us to leave early to be safe.  We really had to weigh the options because of course we had our kids and pets .  We got on the internet and scoured every source .  I went to YouTube and he had a video on where this thing was going and what to expect.  We compared notes , said prayers and make a decision or wait it out!  I think Ryan is the best and most non boring weatherman I’ve ever watched!   Ty! 🤜🏽🤛🏼❤️❤️
Oregon gets snow about end of December to beginning of March!
WEATHER WINNIE PFFT! I just wanna know when I can go ski :3
Bought the solar eclipse glasses. Said ships free.  It sure did.  They sent it right out. However, My package is at the post office waiting for me to come pay the postage due. Lol.
Love your chanel I am a fan of winter snow storm.I lives in Montreal Canada.Can you predict the first snowfall and if we will have a white xmas?Thank Fabio
I got sick of plowing snow four days straight. So my wife and I took our young children and moved to South Carolina. No snow here boys.
Nov. 8 i think
I moved south to leave New England snow behind. Never again.
I live in dover tennessee.  Thank you for telling us the weather. ❤
Ryan,just found your site and enjoy your forecast predictions. We live along a mountain in south central PA. and we have a huge amount of Acorns, Hickory nuts and Walnuts falling this year. Our parents and grandparents were farmers and used this sign from nature as a forecast for bad winters. Is there any scientific “proof” related to this situation ?
Keep the snow away, I want to ride my scooter which has race slicks that cant handle snow lol. But I live in northern Indiana it'll never stay away lol
Snow outlook:  Just like NWS/NOAA, WRONG!
In Grand Rapids, Michigan, it usually snows on or near Thanksgiving. Count on it.
As a truck DRIAAAVVERR thank u
in my state, our last snow was in the beginning of 2022 (end of January) but the fact that my state could be getting snow anywhere from the beginning on september to the beginning of january seems actually quite accurate to me
For those who don't who , yall can go to the local welding supply store and buy a welding lens to look at the sun . All yall need is a shade 10 or higher .
Today Oct 5th 2023, live in Alaska, snow today.
YES!!!! WEATHER!!!!! RAHHHHH!!!! 🦅🦅🦅
Thank you for the discount Ryan! Bought the 5 pack combo for the 4/8/24 eclipse! 😁 I am exciteddddd!!!
Really want snow this year, im in my schools band and we have a couple Christmas concerts and snow would really bring it to life for the elementary school kids that come to see the concerts. In northern indiana so its looking good so far
I'd love to see at least one named nor'easter up here in Vermont! Full disclosure: I may be biased because I snowboard.
AHH just use your eyes
Dear Americans, So the lesson learned here:  “4-Season” tires are NOT winter tires.   Kind Regards, Canada
Being from SE Louisiana around lake ponchartrain ive seen it snow here twice 07 and 18
Yay! I’m a Weather Weenie!
Ryan, We 'll be visited by El Nino between  November & January ( January  which is when Chicago starts seeing snow & frigid temperatures ) The snow fall  has something to do  with La Nina ,not El Nino
Coloardo already has snow in the high mountains.
I knew the answer before I watched the video: 10/31. In lower Michigan anything goes after Halloween. It might snow, it might be 70 degrees. Hell, both could happen in the same day after 10/31.
Is anyone else watching this video to plan for the ice fishing season?
Here in CO, I remember needing to tailor my Halloween costumes to fit around my winter coat. On multiple occasions our first snow was on Oct 31st!
Harper's Ferry here😊 I'm ready for it!!🤗
I live in north Louisiana. We used to get a good snow every few years. Not super heavy, but enough to play in. Its been getting more and more sporadic, maybe snowing for a couple minutes here and there. It looks like we likely wont get any this year based on this info. Last year it barely got cold enough to kill off all the mosquitoes and they have been terrible this year. It also hardly rained this year, its been so hot and dry. Worries me.
I read the title and was so happy just to find out there’s no snow for me
Crazy that it was 87 degrees in Rochester NY yesterday.
Can we just get the winter of the 70s in Michigan again?
Doesnt usually snow in North Alabama until late Jan. Close though!
The Annular eclipse will be visible from here in New Mexico and I'm looking forward to it.
Here I am in Tennessee getting assigned homework. 😂
Will it snow in Athens Tennessee?
What I see for minneapolis area I see ice 🧊 cold 🥶 then freezing, not a lot of snow, some wind snow storms, yet it probably be ice dams and crappy driving conditions;(
Talk about West Virginia you Talk about Cincinnati Ohio and other states around. Thank You for your better forecast information.
We got snow in the sierra already. Last years snow is still here. Its gonna be a crazy year. Hope we have enough snow removal workers and housing. Yikes.
MOTHER NATURE 😍 IS GONNA BE NASTY THIS SNOW FALL YEAR            Weed Me
live in the grey part in montana and haven’t seen snow yet as of oct 5, im kind of happy you’re wrong tbh😂😂😂
I’m a weather weenie!🎉
I could go the rest of my life without seeing snow and I'd be happy. Hope these predictions are right and I get snow later than average
I want a white Christmas in Philly. It’s been such a long time. I haven’t seen one since I was a child, I’m 22 now and I want snow.
Thanks for the link! Picked up a 5 pack 🎉
Would someday like to see enough snow fall to have a dog and harness and a mushers sled
In February
Caterpillars have thick cocoons so cold and no snow plus frogs started farting early creating illusions of UFO's so might be brain fog also.
damn didn't even have to watch but 50 seconds to see that I aint getting any
This is always interesting to me but now that I know it is going to snow any day now. When will it end though? Big questions from the only non skier in my family! 😅
Apparently cities don't exist in the west...
It’s Ryan Hall, Y’all!!!!
This is off.  October is when flagstaff receives frost snow.
last year in maryland we got like nothing so im hoping its better this year
No snow in canada wow
Iv kept track of elnino i was born in san diego 20 years and now past 25 years in great falls mt. that being said what happens on halloween up here sets the tone for winter. and we are looking at a nice warn Halloween which means a hard cold snowy winter. guess only time shall tell.
I just hope we get more snow in Iowa than we have been recently. I feel like the past few years we've had next to no snow, but not even 15-20 years ago, when i was a kid, we had at least a couple feet throughout most of the winter, and usually had a pretty good chance of a white Christmas.
Those historical records are right for our area, according to tradition of the old timers
It'll be wrong like weather forecasts usually are. Especially when it comes to winter predictions. Snow doesn't exist anymore and it'll be 50 degrees in the Mid-Atlantic ALL WINTER LONG!!!!!
Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.  According to him, we were suppose to have a wetter than normal summer where I live.  Not only was it one of the driest but hottest on record with 40+ consecutive days over 100.
🤣😅😂🤣😅😂 I kind of knew I was a weather weenie, but to hear it out loud makes it real. Also, I am sending this video to a fellow weather weenie!😂
I mean, the fact I looked up at Pikes Peak and saw it completely covered in snow, yeah, I think early snowfall is going to be a big thing for me.
Trump should have used those😊
Nice maps Ryan
I just moved to Chattanooga Tennessee from Philadelphia pa. I want cold weather and some snow. I'm not working but this forecast looks great
Grey zone, no snow yet. 70° on Monday the 9th. We usually get snow around Christmas. Last year we had snow on sept 23rd, but then we had 6 months of winter last year.
Uh, you don't need solar glasses to see an eclipse.  During the partial phases you can project an image of the sun using something as simple as a pinhole and a box. Or you can use lenses or a binocular or small telescope to project an image. And during totality take those glasses off and enjoy looking at the sun's corona directly!
"White was the color of the snow that fell in Centennial Park..." new lyric for invisible string. ❤
BS ... Winter is Winter
Is it to early to predict the first 24 hours below freezing in Minnesota?
It’s always the exact opposite of what they predict. Nothing new
2021 All of Texas saw snow including Mexico
Thank You from all of us Truckers !!!!❤ you have saved many lives 🙌
I live in Nashville! I set a reminder on my phone Ryan!
If ur right about the snowfall in Tennessee, I want u to pick my lottery numbers from there on out. Just sayin.
I woke up to snow 2 weeks ago. Not hail. Snow
Just ordered my solar eclipse glasses praying they come in time
Central MT here. Surprised he haven't gotten snow yet.
Oh no.. i just got news broke to me. 😢im a weather weenie😞. Pray for me guys 🙏🏼
Everyone brought a welding helmet to work during that solar eclips
Can't wait
nope don’t love it, just won’t to know if Karnack texas is getting snow, and what date will the first flake hit???
Not helpful really :(
I AM A WEATHER WEANIE
Hi. I live in the Nashville area. I will let you when it snows!!!
Thumbnails getting out hand.
Now, I am just going out on a limb here but, I think we will see snow this...... WINTER!!!!!!  OMG!!!!!! Its going to SNOW in the WINTER?!?!?!?!? Are you efffing kidding me right now?!?!?!??! Climate Change is real people!!!!!!!
Meh.  Wait until April 8th.  A 4+ minute total euclipse from San Antonio & Dallas to Indy, to Toledo Cleveland, Plattsburgh.  I'm holding out for that one.
You’re accurate but you’re just the BEST! Always enjoy your uploads and live streams! Thanks for all that you do. 🥰
Hey  can I make a request.    when you do graphs with colors   can you  choose DIS SIMILAR colors?  For those of us colorblind, when you have 4+ areas all in blue,  we cannot tell the difference.  So if you can choose like   RED Blue Yellow, Green,   colors where they are all totally different that would help a lot !!    THANKS !
Southern Alberta is usually Halloween it hits. So far, no, but a week before, it says a mix. So you are pretty accurate, Ryan. Please include us in Alberta. We send the Clippers anyway, sorry 😊
I'm a tell ya right now you got the historical average pegged! My ex-wife's birthday is Nov 16th, we live in MI, and since 1990 we had a running joke that her birthday would never come if we didn't see snow during that week...That the world would end! :D  It hasn't ended as of yet because we've never missed that mark. Her birthday has never come without us seeing our first snow of the year.
Parts of Colorado got significant snow the 2nd week of September this year
6:19 Your phones eye is protected but you still have to see the screen. That looks difficult!
I saw the one in 2017 and i felt like i wasted all day for nothing seeing this silly event take place
its a little sad that im in the later than average snowfall area. i love the snow and i love the cold
Here in East/Central Iowa, I can't remember the last time it snowed in November or December. We haven't seen snow until January for several years.
Utah upper elevations first heavy snowfall Oct 3
You are not the best weather forecaster! Mother Nature is!  In the last month, I have been watching the animals' squirrels, rabbits, birds, and even the ants are EXTREMELY!! busy i'v already got the snow blower ready 😂
I wear my welders helmet when watching a solar eclipse. I don't trust those flimsy paper sunglasses
I live in northern VT and it's 80 today. I need winter lol
Thank you dear Sir. You are absolutely amazing. 🎉
"You're a weather weenie" 😂🤣
Got my glasses! Used your promo code with no issues. Looking forward to a later snowfall this season here in Michigan.
Start @2:30. You’re welcome
“Thanks”, Milankovitch Cycles!
Snow in Big Sky Montana already
But december 15th? I live in that area and havent seen snow till January or later in like 4 years.. how old is your data?
Im not a weather weenie, just a truck driver 😂
I remember the first snow ever back in 1987, it was cold outside and with a little drop of heaven the moisture in the air froze into clumps of snow and it built up into snow when it wz snowin s s s snow  Snowing snowing snowing… C’mon Errr bppp puh puh ughh pop pop pop S s s snow re urerggha errgha Let’s go Errr bppp puh puh ughh pop pop pop S s s snow re urerggha errgha
Alright Weather Boy. I live in south Wisconsin and according to this I should see snow by November 23rd. I will be back to report whether or not I see snow at that time. (If I can even remember this)
Hope this winter in Dallas TX isnt like last year...warm and just blah.. ( miss Colorado!! )
"Later then average" isn't  "when you will see snow". Even the 5yr old could have come up with that.
Yes, I’m a bit of a weather weenie. I have a son who is on the spectrum who is up and coming.  Now that he’s a young man, I’m telling him about more detailed weather information sites like this, and the actual NWS. I have a funny feeling he may come around to being a heck of an amateur meteorologist himself.
January 3rd got it.
Its 1:38am on October 4th here in Nashville TN and I didn't expect Ryan to call his shot like that....
Would you by chance add Alaska to the list?
As an American i was used to  1st snow between Nov. and Dec. i went to summer camp in Montreal and it snowed the last week of August . I assumed it was a freak thing but the councilors told me it happens allot and i was shocked . That 30 minutes north of Montreal it snowed in September.   Freaked me out as a kid
First time ive ever seen any of your videos. Guess im a weather weenie
I dont want snow i just want it to be cold
Make it cold already i cant wait for cold weathers
This is quite accurate for recent times! As a kid, there was always snow on the ground by Halloween in my area of Minnesota. Now it's definitely coming later and later. One year in the mid/late Twenty-Teens, we didn't see snow until December! Melting is happening earlier and earlier, too. Used to hang around well into May, but now sometimes it's gone by March. I hate snow, but I can certainly tell that it's deeply affecting things, as it's getting more droughty due to lack of snow during the winters.
I’m surprised the Weather Channel hasn’t hired you to do all of their weather predictions. They’re rarely accurate, and you’re incredibly accurate!
There will be record snowfall in the U.S. this year, and early 24. In fact, the amount of snow in the northeast will be beyond belief. Many will not be able to leave their house for days. There will be much damage and casualties. Younger people will tell their grandchildren about the snow many years in the future. There will documentaries, movies and even T-Shirts that say I survived the blizzard of 2023/24.
SLC typically sees its first snow in early Nov (not late Nov as the map showed). Our first snow last year was Oct 23rd and the last snow happened a week into April. Definitely a long, active winter that dropped 90” in the city and 900” in the mountains when all was said and done. Hoping for another good one! 🙏
Dude was wrong for the last 5 years of me watching him. Why do people sub for inaccuracies?
Weather weeenie unite
Weather Weenies Unite!!! YA'LL....😂
I'm saving my vacation days for snow days
I LIVE IN NASHVILLEE
Up here in montana we got our first snow in the mountains like a week and a half ago 😂
i always wait till right before bad winter weather to stock up on groc, and fill my gas tank up,
Weather weenie 😂😂😂 got me good
This Nashvillian who’s a teacher will DEFINITELY be taking note of the first ❄️ in Nashville 😂
im in the brown zone but i live in manitoba canada
You do a great job with your weather reporting. We always enjoy watching 💯
IF EL NIÑOS ARE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THE SOUTH WETTER WHY HAVE I NOT SEEN RAIN IN A MONTH…
“Weather weenie”, lol!
Why do you have to share your arms in our face?  Why don't you just use your mouth?????? You are making who watch you, dizzy.
Well what if my state is not even on the second graph
Hi!! What do you think about the NOAAA predictions? The weather channel is predicting warmer and drier than average winters for most of the country but a lot of these models I am seeing are similar to yours! I trust you ryan haha
I just want to see how accurate you are. Your spring and summer were offf
as a floridian i am nothing short of disappointed
Typical weather guy, not very accurate and his paycheck won’t e effected.
Gardner Colorado rarely sees any snow at all. If we do, it don’t last in my little paradise.
Peoria, Il represent!
literally said nothing of substance and went on a tangent about a solar eclipse ....
We usually get our first snow on Halloween in Michigan
What are you thinking for East Coast? Will we finally have a winter or just rain? Smh
Louisiana here! I can’t wait for a change of pace after this summer.
Can confirm Colorado has already had some snow on Pikes Peak.  I mean it is the second time already but still really accurate.
Weather wennie 🥰
its been really wet here in MN, just waiting for it to cool down and we will get snow
I’m from south Tx McAllen  and we never get snow do you think that this year we could get some snow
We shall see, Im in Ky 15 mins from Bowling Green and and close to TN border. Snow in December for xmas bring it on
Mt Washington NH saw snow early in September . . .
I do appreciate the honesty from Ryan but people can or are debating he is not lying or depending on viewers opinion and I agree with Nashville seeing It's first time seeing snow in the south region but I do remember that when I arrived in Lebanon TN it was chilly out but it felt good only one time I expect climate change is effecting& warming up the Earth's temperature to go up a pace that is so very wrong .
I only saw 30 seconds of one of his videos a couple weeks ago and subscribed immediately.
Has an nasa astronaut ever took the stand in a American court of law and sweared to tell the truth ? Lol
October 3rd, should be breaking heat records in Montreal, Canada today.. Snow can wait! :) ~ 83F!
i've lived in south mississippi for 19 years and not once in my entire life have i seen snow. just thought i'd tell you so u can add my little hometown as red to ur map!
The La Nina this past year gave S. Cal a HUGE amount of rainfall to the point of pulling us out of the drought completely and filling up all reservoirs.  I don't think the La Nino year will even come close to that rainfall.
It usually snows around Thanksgiving here in western ny althought ive seen it by the end of october.
I need snow here in Seattle, Wa.
In wichita ks it's gunnna be 60 in January. Crazy
I'm from NC. We almost never see snow before January. It's crazy rare...but typically we get almost no snow at all. I'm not in the mountains.
Already got 6 inches up here in Snowbird, Utah
So no snow in Georgia 😞
I live in Rochester, NY, and our local area is preparing for a large number of visitors coming from places like Boston, NYC, and possibly Philly to see the solar eclipse next April.  We are the last decent sized U.S. city in the 100% totality path before it heads into Canada, and our area is the closest to large cities such as Boston and NYC.
Finally I’ll get to go snowboarding this year if we get snow like we’re supposed to
I already have plans for the April Solar eclipse to be in the path of totality.  Can't wait! I'll get me some glasses with your link :)
I wish you also covered canada in your forecasts
And last night longs peak and the high northern Colorado Rockies got snow! Oct 2nd! Looking at a fresh dusting this morning! We have also had a major blizzard with feet of snow in the western suburbs of Denver on oct 10th before! I love the fall!!
Ahhh right alaska isn’t apart of the us okay 👍
Snowing currently in Meredith,Colorado as I type this. Tue Oct 3
Me watching from Houston knowing damn well that I probably won't get any snow. 😂😂
❤❤
I have snow 😢
Great video! I'm deep in the blue on the prediction map, and it's already getting pretty nippy and wet. Mountains are seeing snow, do I believe the first snowfall for the lower elevations is right around the corner! May just be wishful thinking, as it was a very snowy winter last year too, but we'll see! Great video as always Ryan, thanks for doing what you do!!
I tired of warm winters in central ohio. I need cold temps hate summer. My body has never be good above 78
Will this be another winter with no snow in New England ? Past few years we haven’t gotten any
Love this guy!  I'm already cold!  SE AZ,  lol
PRAYING!! I see a blizzard in PA again like 2016.
NOVEMBER 1ST? over here snowfall ended over here in september (from what i remember) i only get 2 months without insane snow?
Windsor ontario...February
Bostonian here 🙋 and I’m so terrified that “later than average” doesn’t mean “less than average” 😂 I don’t enjoy the cold but I LOATHE snow 🥶 I’m hoping this winter isn’t too bad 🤞🤞🤞
I am a skier so finding this channel is going to help a lot thank you
1/3/24  in Nashville.. I will let you guys know.. Also it my son's  birthday. Usually  don't snow until around the 10th of January  and rarely do we have a white Xmas any more.
Think you should do a 10 to 20 year average. I grew up in the Chicagoland area and it’s usually between holloween and thanksgiving not December.  Lived in Peoria and it’s usually November not Dec jan I could go on but nice
It’s been snowing in Utah since before you posted this
dude should give some context on the first snow usually occurring in the HIGHER elevations (mountains and such).  also...just how far back are you using for "historical" records. history is everything past the present moment.  FSU meteorology teachers taught me to F with numbers too man. never trust a poll or statistical analysis where you don't have all the info.
I'm in Maine. I just hope the temp doesn't drop below -40 like last Feb.
Not Minnesota being in the mid 80’s beginning October, where’s my poor snow and fall days MN
Colorado already has snow and we’re expecting that we’re most likely going to have snow in the Denver area most likely a week and a half before Halloween at the latest
We have about 5 inches of snow in Utah mountains today
What’s the odds of it ever snowing again in Los Angeles area ?
Auto darken welding helmet.
Plz snow i need to learn skiing this time. 🙏🏻 🙏🏻  Before going away to tropics 😢
Proud to be a weather weenie! Thanks for all you do!
We got snow here in Utah today!
WOW SAME THING HAPPENS EVERY YEAR HOW PRIDICTABLE
Minnesotan here , I’m hoping el Nino keeps us warm and minimal snow lol
It’s typically the rule of thumb that if it’s a shytt summer, it will be a shytt winter
lived in florida and never got to see snow in person, but will see it for the first time on november when its my first time going out of florida
So still sporadic got it.  Won't be seeing it
Ordered 😉Thank you Ryan Hall!!
Sorry, Ryan, you got the NC appalachians wrong. Snow usually starts in early to mid November, but occasionally in late October. Waiting until December almost Never happens
Farmers almanac. More snowfall this year than normal. I expect some heavy late Nov into Dec snowfalls
This is my first winter back up north since living in. Florida for a couple years. I just want the ponds frozen enough for hockey
Oh, dear Ryan!  I see a Country Song written - just for you, for your Nashville Prediction.   :)
Its going to snow in the winter? omg... genius!
well  nailed it oct 2nd colorado snow
ON POINT....THK YOU ALL...🌹
Living in Murfreesboro, I'll remember.
I never see snow anymore now that I have left the Midwest and move to a warmer climate the only place you're going to find snow nowadays is up in Flagstaff deep in the Rocky Mountains.
I saw the solar eclipse happen in the west and I was like “MAN, when is Maine gonna get one of these bad boys”, then Buddy here pulled out his trap card and make me spend $12 (actually $10) because of his code on two pairs of glasses
theres snow time to waste! go outside and enjoy the weather while you can!
I'm in Nashville..... let's see how accurate you are... 😊
bruh, i got an ad, skipped it, but another ad started playing immediately. i thought that would be all, but nooooooo youtube played another ad, which i skipped, that was immediately followed up by another ad
Sucks we don’t see as much snow here in San antonio
How many do I add or subtract here in okc
Ryan, is it really catastrophically flooding in NYC?  I don’t really believe all those other folks. And I know you will tell the truth.  Thanks.
no surprises,your bold call gave  us 4-6" eastern maine20-15 years ago,nothing personal! sorry for the delayed ran't
The weather weenie thing really caught me off guard haha
I’m in Colorado and according to this I should have already seen snow.   It doesn’t look like that’s even a possibility in the next two weeks.    😂 ( not counting the mountains. ) that’s ok.   Also laughing at the precise prediction for TN.
N. Illinois, no late snow 👍.
Snow ❄️
I am in the foothills of NC it used to snow here in Nov. Early Dec. It has not snowed in 2 years at all but a few flakes.   Our mountains usually sees snow in November though. We have several ski resorts.   I wish it would snow in NC like it used to.
Thanks man
Ryan, we have Arkansas Weather Watchers  started  appx 8 yes or so ago, homegrown , extremely accurate ,I use both of you, senior citizen cannot send money  so glad I can see your site
Can confirm, SE Florida has had 3 weeks of daily afternoon rain fall.  Ground saturation and standing water is becoming an issue.
Just sayin, if you wanna come stay at my place for that solar eclipse, I'm less than a mile away from the center-line across Amherst/Lorain, Ohio.... just sayin
Just south of Nashville in Brentwood, I'll keep an eye out for this 1/3/24 snow!
You are right on for Western Montana.  It's October 2, and it snowed  10 days ago.  Nothing down low, but the mountains.
*El Nino years ALSO ARE INCLUDED IN HISTORICAL AVERAGES.*  If you were attempted to do PREDICTIVE SCIENCE, you would do this:  1. Pull out data all El Nino years. 2.  Take the average of snow fall starts for every reporting station. 3.  Take the average of the earliest snow fall starts, i.e., average from earliest 10% dates. 4.  Take the average of the latest snow fall starts, i.e., average from latest 10% dates.  Then make three maps from the three averages.  Map 1: the earliest likely snowfall starts under El Nino Map 2: the latest likely snowfall starts under El Nino Map 3: the likely snow fall starts under El Nino based on the average  You could do the same for accumulation.   *The most of your video merely is wild chatter about weather with a pseudo-scientific vibe.*
Yup! I'm a "Weather Weenie" for sure. I  Love this stuff.
No shit Sherlock! We'll see snow this winter!! Wow! I'm so amaze!!!!
Not ready for winter don't have heat in the house only portable heaters
Hey! Will we see snow is Las Cruces,NM? There was none last year
Va didn’t get any snow so this is cap for my area haha
Unfortunately, [these things] will continue to *escalate* up to the end.
The grey area you mentioned last is because that's the usual cold air mass that comes down from Canada, where I live in central Alberta, which means this video has little bearing on Canadians. Amazing how the weather just stops right there at the US north border.
!remindme Oh wait wrong platform
Ryan's forecasts are about the same as the Weather Channel. But Ryan's definitely better than these local TV stations!
Through my analytics, I just found out that many of my viewers watch your channel. So I came to check it out. Well - I'm in Maryland and I am READY for a big one like we used to have. Last winter I didn't even touch a shovel. Not once.
We got our first snow on Mt Charleston in Vegas last night October 2nd.
I just wanna go snow wheeling!!!
not me sitting here between Virginias mountains knowing that we will get barely any snow or a ton load of snow.
Delaware has no real winters anymore.  Stinks.
To hear that my husband may be wrong a 6th year in a row, makes me happy. 6 years ago he swore we, in southern AZ never gets snow. :)  He has been wrong each consecutive winter since
Between Ryan's and Don Day's forecasts you can pretty much take what they say to the bank.
I was in high school for an eclypse.  They let everyone go outside to witness it.  1970's.
grabbed some glasses...thanks for the reminder (saw many people last time selling them for $10+ each!)
I am not a weeny, I do not sing Goofy Goober songs.
Next year April 8th will be another incredible TOTAL ECLIPSE. An annular eclipse is not TOTAL. You can actually take your glasses off during a TOTAL ECLIPSE ONLY  if your in the path of totality and during totality. But make sure to put them back in a few seconds before the sun exits behind the moon. You can download many apps that know by your location when totality starts and ends.
Hahaha. I laughed out loud when he said “weather weenie” lmao!!
Ya your “gray” area of OMG you could get snow early? Could see 80s this weekend so ya, be wrong and keep your job once again for y’all
Thanks for the reminder about getting glasses for the eclipse. I couldn't find mine from the last time. Used your recommendation and purchased them through the link. Thanks!
Y'all say I am a weather weenie? Yessir. Something truck drivers pay attention to.
that's how it was last year.  NH was warmer than usual and not a lot of snow.
Nashville here
"You can be the dufas in the parking lot..."😂
Last eclipse I saw I used a wielding mask
California: I caused climate change and I like it Illinois: Missouri: Iowa:
Where do you recommend I fly for the Total eclipse in April for best visibility ?
My Birthday is April 8th!
There was almost no snow in Chicago last year, so I'm hoping for blizzards this winter
I live in Murfreesboro, just Southeast of Nashville. Jan 3rd, 10:33 P.M. first snowflake watch!  I will let you know, Ryan.
you focus way too much on south east in all your videos
every single video bro posts "VERY DIFFERENT", "VERY BIZZARE," "NOT NORMAL" and yall just eat it up
Love the exact predictions, is so much fun either way just to see how close it happens to !
Im in utah and we got snow today at the ski resorts almost a foot
September 30th- October 1st....snow on the Wasatch mountain range.      White peaks,  golden aspens, crimson scrub oak, bright blue skies, and just a few big white puffy clouds.  God is a genious!
We’ve already had a dusting of snow on our mountains in southwest Montana.
I hope not. Last time it snow. Our water and power was shutdown. It was a bad scene for everyone.
It's okay. I have a welding helmet😆👍
We have already had a little bit of snow
Oklahoma get snow
So there was a volcano that erupted over by japan? or somewere over there. this happened last winterish. and they said this will affect the storms of summer of 2023. and beyond. and they were correct a hurricane/storm hit cali. and the desert.... so Yes this winter is gunna be different. and im from South Southern Illinois.
Already have in Wyoming
If you include Canada you'll get more likes.
here in East/central Washington State, we can get snow anywhere from mid Oct thru mid Dec
So florida still should be snowless correct? If so that kinda sucks an inch of snow would be life changing for me as it would be my second time ever seeing snow and i wouldn’t have to go all the way to Washington D.C to see it either
Do you have a Canadian map with projections?
🌬️🍃 🌭😂😂😂
Damn I'm a weather wieney
Good thing I live in Nashville TN! 😂
I use a shade 12 welding lens, a lot cheaper than 20 bucks
Not as concerned about how soon as i am about how much.
What happened in New York?
Thanks Ryan. Looking forward to plowing snow a little early this year in Washington state. Helped out quite a bit last year. Appreciate it
It looks like Kentucky could have a white Christmas this year
I always felt so different. Now, I understand that I'm a weather weenie. 😊
Mammoth Lakes just received some snow at 6:30pm PST :D
I'm near to both of the solar eclipses in Texas. I'm not excited by cold weather in Texas, but I wasn't thrilled about the 108 degree temps we had here in the summer. The ground temp was 160 degrees. The wood deck was 144; the top of my table saw under a tent was 200!  So I'm behind in my project.
Hey Ryan Hall. I live in Oshawa Ontario Canada. Why are days warm some times hot? Then nights are cooler?   Do you have a system that explains why this works ? Thanks.
I still don't know what we're going to get in Virginia
We will be leaving on Friday from British Columbia for Florida and thankfully traveling in the no snow zone, thanks Ryan Hall.
I'm in northern utah, the mountains tops got a dusting of snow yesterday
What about Virginia?
Got glasses for the fam & also ordered my y’all o’meter - I missed out on it last year. Hopefully we don’t get anywhere close to the 36” mark!
Welding helmets/goggles work nicely for eclipses.
It didn’t snow in the forecast is wrong for Memphis
As a Nashvillian, i will remember this and I will be back...
Ryan is Making weather forecasts great again
I googled the weather for Astoria New York and although they speculate higher precipitation, they forecast warmer tempuratures
No Alaska?
I have famiky in twi parts of Colorado. They already had snow the 3ed weekend in September, were myself in NE Tennessee, and had a 90-degree weekend.
I am a Weather Weenie!
What about Lafayette TN, Christmas Snow?
Oh wow this is going to be the most accurate video for claiming the accurate weather!
Hey Ryan -  Is Andy Hill OK?   Is he on vacation?    Keep up the good work!
😂🤣yeah right  just look out the window and and go outside the when you know what the day is going to be like 🙄
I am in northern Ohio and if we don't see snow till Nov 16 we will be lucky
I appreciate your work. Thank you for sharing ❤
NY will have a warm winter!!!
Would you consider doing Canada’s weather as well? Because I really like the way you present the weather.
The 2023-24 winter season in the US is expected to be different due to El Nino. This weather phenomenon will amplify the southern jet stream, causing significant snowstorms in the southern US. The impact of El Nino will vary across the country, but it is likely to keep the North and Northwest colder and drier, while the South and East will be wetter and warmer. The timing of the first snowfall will also be affected by El Nino. Areas in the green and light blue regions may not see snow at all or only experience sporadic snowfall in January or February. The darker blue region typically sees the first snowfall after December 15th or before December 30th, while the light purple zone sees snowfall between December 1st and December 15th. The darker shade of purple indicates that a large area of the US will see snowfall between November 16th and December 1st, while the pink zone experiences snowfall between November 1st and November 16th. The final gray zone indicates that snow can occur as early as October 2nd. However, these are just historical averages, and the El Nino pattern means that the timing and amount of snowfall may vary significantly from these averages.
November 10, 2024 for snow in Ohio
What I learn? I'm a weather weenie. 😂
adirondack observatory in Tupper Lake NY  is having an April 8 eclispe party, the whole town is to..we have  a super spot!! come have fun in the middle of the Adirondacks~sure to be a hoot !!  love your channel!
I got my solar eclipse glasses and phone covers ordered thanks Ryan. I already got my vacation set and we're going to be doing some camping in the Texas Hill Country during April
I live in Palm Bay FL so I'm good, God Bless the rest of yous up north tho. Make sure to get your vitamin D
Who made you a profit/prophet? B.S.
Hey Ryan, don't forget that Alaska is part of the United States, so your video forgot about us. 🤔
You should show maps for more than just the USA. It is very rude to just cut off the maps like you do.
We're getting snow up here in Fairbanks, AK starting late tonight (2023-10-01), and by Monday we'll have about an inch while part of the Alaska Range (south of us) will be getting up to 6 inches. It's already winter up here, folks. 🙂 I've read that we're likely to have a milder than normal winter this year, though we'll see. Usually whatever happens up here will be felt in the central plains around 3-5 days later, depending on how fast it's moving. Ha, people in Missouri get a couple inches of snow and it's "snowmageddon!", while we get 60 inches of snow and -40 F temps and nobody thinks anything of it. 🤣
1st snow today in UT.    In the higher elevations of course!
Colorado had snow in September last year!!!
I'm in a green zone but our woolly caterpillars are all black this fall.   Gonna be a cold winter even if it only snows in January.   🎶 I'm a Weather Weenie 🎶
🤔 really 😂😂😂😂
Weather weenie here. Tornadoes in the south, snow in Wyoming. It's all good, baby.
I live close to Seattle Washington, so it's  blue zone, meaning Early Snow ❄️? 😅
If I'm remembering right the big snow storms did not reach us in Northern New England during an El Nino.   Is that accurate? I thought the El Nino was a warmer winter for us too but I could be totally off! Lol
That is a fascinating forecast, because you're describing the exact conditions that existed here in Washington state when I got up here the first time for work in 2017, and that year as well I watched a solar eclipse and the winter was very, very mild. Meanwhile, back in Texas it was incredibly wet, making your words seemingly quite prophetic?
Charlotte area is very low to see it
We always enjoy you videos.  And thank you for the heads up on the glasses.  We purchased the five pack.
When will we be getting out weather weenie badge in the mail?
Lol this fool is wrong more then actual metrologist
Thank you for sharing this ride. We are in that area often and prefer state roads over the interstate. Might tow our  RV that way in 6 weeks when we are back in that area.
While I want to get my hopes up YET AGAIN for snow I'm gonna refrain from begging the snow gods to bless us snow lovers with snow, Last year I think we barely got a single FLURRY😢 So if you can, PLEASE PLEASE send us maryland snow lovers a couple back to back blizzards this winter, and if you have any connections with the snow Gods maybe put in a good word for us too
We'll see about that.
Being in central Saskatchewan and having years were ya have to get a costume two or three sizes bigger to accommodate a parka for Halloween. This prediction is justifiably a good idea for when we may have snow, in recent years we have seen snow within the first week of November, but if this is accurate then we will see it closer to December. Shorter winter just means less feeding of the livestock.
So will Atlanta see snow or naw
Why are you showing a map that shows part of the Mississippi River up to Illinois and then another River joining in that curls way back into the West part of the United States as if you're showing a map that shows the entire Mississippi River? You need to make sure your maps are correct because a lot of gun kids that might see this would say oh wow look the Mississippi goes way back over into the Northwest part of the United States it don't go just straight North, use a little bit more of an accurate map
A blind monkey could make this prediction.
Nashville Tennessee here!
I guess us folks here in NC are left with no snow this coming winter .. bummer
I live in Denver, and we haven’t got snow yet, and there is no snow forecast for 10 days . . . And tomorrow is October second. . .
Love Ryan's forecast reports.  I just wish California would keep staying wet. I want rain in California non fn stop
Bought the solar eclipse glasses. Couldn't pass up 5 pairs with the photo filter lense for $20.40!
So Ins of our daytime highs of 15 degrees F in the winter, we should expect 25 degrees F?
We start getting snow in November here in north central Washington state
You do a really good thing here. Thank you
👍
I'm smack dab in the middle of the big April 2024 eclipse path. Saved my viewing glasses from the eclipse 7 yrs ago in 2017 so I'm all set to go.
Every year we have winter.  Enough of the hype. It happens.
NONONONONONONO Waitwaitwaitwait.....
YAY!!!!! An Eastern Oregonian by birth, forced to now be a Western Washingtonian I am THRILLED to see snow, and now early???? WOOOT!!!!!! 🥳
Could we see a storm like the 1993
The weather has been so crazy this year.  I hope it gets kinda normal again… whatever that is lol.      Take care 👵🏻👩‍🌾❣️
Omg
Alaska and Hawaii are also states. I live in Alaska and we snow earliest late september and latest in late october. There is already snow in the towns in the mountains about a week ago, lower altitudes will probably see snow in a week or so.
No snow in southern Indiana please!
Bold predictions 💕
Chicago really didn’t get no snow the last 3 years
While most of your forecasts have been right, I must disagree with you on this one. I live in Wilmington, NC and we rarely see snow while farther inland, like Raleigh sees it every year. From Wilmington north along the coast, we hardly get snow. I’ve lived here for about 40 years and during that time we have maybe had snow less than a dozen times with maybe 4 times it has been enough to measure.
15 million in damage? not that bad considering how much nazov ukraine cost us
im over the pink zone and 1/3 of the years the first snow cover around christmas
I wish there were people who did those first expected snowfall things here in the uk. Online it says october or november but it doesnt say the first measurable snowfall
Thanks
Ffffffff..... greeeat, my whole entire state is gonna get covered in snow I had a single year where I live that got a massive blizzard that blocked my door halfway up
Dude, I'm just gonna use my welding helmet for the solar eclipse
I'm pretty close to Nashville...we'll see😊
Undoubtedly the best climate, weather and disaster predictions. Top Notch !!
El Niño please deliver the snow to VT
Oooh cooler weather
I wonder how those people in Tennessee are going to measure whether or not that snowflake fell at exactly 10:33. Does it have to hit the ground at that minute, or can it still be in the process of falling?
You're doin god's work, Ryan
All I have to say is then when the UP, if Michigan, gets it's first snowfall the Detroit area will get their first snowfall a month later.  That idea hasn't steered me wrong yet.
We're not scared of snow up here in New England. I'll take snow over a Hurricane any day.
I might want to take the trouble to go on a road trip to the upper left corner of Pennsylvania in 2024 to see the solar eclipse. I did see one before, but I forget what year it was.
Darker shade of purple people represent lol.
Last night 10/1 Dusting.  Central Utah 1820m High alpine desert. Witch of November came early.
I'm not a weenie :(
Looking forward to an awesome snow this year.....from Sierra Nevada Mts usual first snow here is once before Thanks giving. And then it's snow on after! . 😀✌️🌨️
In North, Idaho, we have snow on the mountains right now.
Why no Canada 😔
As much as I love this channel, even he knows better than to try to forecast winter weather for North Carolina. It would break him psychologically 😂. We could have a snow storm two counties over and they still aren’t calling it 100%.
Jfk airport in queens ny got over 3 ft I'm hoping we get at least 2
It is all a guess based on history, but what it did before has nothing to do with the weather now
That is pretty bold, Ryan
Last year we had 10 inches on the 10 October 2022
It’s 85 today in Wisconsin. I’d love a snowfall right now. So sick of this hot humid weather
As a peoria resident, typically we see snow in November
We already got snow this weekend in tahoe
I like this video, but info relevant to me is left out because I live in Canada. 😞
Here in est canada we get snow in late November
I am proud to be a weather weenie but i am not proud to live in Georgia bc i will probably never see snow again 😔
thumbnail for this video was clickbait... He's finally at the clickbait level. :(
I'm hoping for warm and dry this Winter! I live in the sporadic zone, so I'm fine if we don't get much cold.
"This year is going to be very different" No, not really lmao. It's a typical El Nino year, gotta like how you try to spin it as something far worse though.
Got a few centimeters of snow on the Dusy Ershim Trail in the central Sierra Nevada Mountains Saturday September 30th
I remember that blizzard in 2003. I'm in the northern Virginia West Virginia border and I was out of school for two and a half weeks cuz the road that my house was on was undrivable for at least a week. You couldn't go anywhere My Jeep had literally been covered except for the two bike rack bars on top you could still see them. I ate a bunch of acid and had a great time in the snow lol
It's October 1st, my thermometer says 95, in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Something is way wrong here.
The higher peaks here in Washington state got a light powdering 3 nights ago
Lol I’ve seen more eclipses than I have days of snow so I’m not sure why I clicked. Guess I just like this channel.
Noooo i dont get snow early this year
october 1st here in Minnesota and its 90degrees outside
Michigan needs a ton of snow
I remember the last North Carolina MAJOR snow storm based on like certain memories as I was like 7-8 and yeah it was 2003.
Great video❤
Ryan, meterologists can't get the weather right even a week ahead, and you're predicting months out.
love your videos.  You usually put broadcaster eather folk to shame as they seem to be the only people that can be wrong more than 50% of the time and still keep their job. Solid work as always. An added factor for this years snow includes the increase in solar forcing due to the continuing (and accelerated) weakening of earth's magnetosphere. We've been seeing the northern lights in arizona, texas and mexico recently.  These were medium solar storms at best. This will impact our winter more so when coupled with an el nino year compared to the previous la nina.
That map would have been more useful if it had also included Canada's and Mexico's snow weather pattern. ;-)
Anecdotally, I doubt we'll see even a significant snowfall event in Rochester NY, it's been far warmer and less snowy than when I was a kid.
Didn’t last year we get our first snow in Cincinnati around thanksgiving?
im just wondering is South MS gonna have a winter that isn't hot this year into next, this summer straight whooped my ass this year
I'm in Northeast Ohio. I only want snow for Xmas. The rest of the time it can stay away.
I am still waiting on the snow from last year
I’m in Nashville Ryan, I hope you’re right🙏🏼
Less snow the better ❤
Yep it already snowed on mt rainier.
What about Kentucky what do you think when it’s going to happen
Aye bg ky 😂
I guess I am now a weather weenie 😔
Thanks 😊 for the heads up 😃👍👍
Let it snow ❄️🌨️❄️❄️🌨️❄️🌨️❄️ it's gonna be big....Texas 🔥🔥🔥🔥 is gonna be cold ..we never get snow ❄️🌨️❄️ often
Bro you should take over WDBJ7's meteorologists because your too smart and btw i live somewhere in the Virginia is on the east of Usa
You are so much fun amd my Husband and I love your show. We are in LAPINE Oregon.  And you are accurate. Thank you so much.❤
Here Florida doesn’t snow I wish it did ❄️☃️⛄️I use to live in Boston years ago but I want to make a snow man my children to experience the snow they never have Godbless everyone
Ooh we gone see I'm in Nashville lol
Utah has already had snow…twice and tonight for the 3rd time…that’ll turn into a winter blur…
Just ordered the glasses!! Thank you!
I work in landscaping snow removal in the tri-state area of Pennsylvania New Jersey Delaware and Wornall dabbling in snow in Maryland if it ever happens based on the past few years it seems nonexistent but after seeing a bunch of comments of people saying that you are eerily and creepily spot-on with your forecast I think that those words should just be turned into you are the snow psychic! And as I am considered the snow princess in my circles I think that is only right that I sub your channel and become a fan! So El Nino let's bring on some snow this year because my guys in this area on East Coast are begging for some white cash
Diskike for not including canada. Rude.
To bad you didn't report on the Ny flood   guess I should have asked a psychic
The Wasatch mountains in Utah just got snowed on a good bit this morning 😋
I got buried by snow from a Metro North train during the Blizzard of 2016!
In my area of NM we almost always have the first snow right around Halloween
mt rose in tahoe got some snow yesterday 09/30/23
This is fun watching from Florida lol.
Snowed here yesterday 😅 banff/Canmore Alberta
Yeah I’m gonna see snow October 2 and it’s gonna be 80° on that day😂
yea ok bud
those glasses are free at public libraries
I live in Michigan and we can have all 4 seasons in one day!! lol I love your content for sure!! Thanks for all you do!!
litteraly with the early shift our water temps are starting to drop below normal though the gulf is still over warmed ,,, though the rains are holding back temp near Panama over all temps are droping repectfully well in a shorter time
My hummers left 2 weeks ago. They typically leave 3 to 4 weeks before first snowfall
How about Canada?
ummm the oceans cooling the airs cooling with few tornados ,, still the typhoons are mixing the sea how is that going to effect the overall enter to spring
I live in the mountain in Colorado. We haven't seen snow yet, but I'm ok with that honestly. Winter lasts a really long time up here.
I'm a weather nerd. I totally admit it.
I’m an ole East Tennessee boy, Rogersville, will we get snow by December 15 ?  I remember the blizzard of 93, we had over 3 feet. Most I ever remember. But in 50’s we had to go to school till 4th of July.
im looking forward to the early snowfall this year just got a new snowmobile and ive been itching to ride
I'm in Bozeman, Montana. We have had no snow, and in the next week it's supposed to warm up into the 70s.
It’s October 1 here in the NE and a gorgeous 77 degrees
funny how that snowfall map understands the north/south jersey border better than the governor
Would be nice to hear about when different ski resorts will get snow instead of like… Chicago and bowling green.
West Coast winter prediction video please ❤
You are absolutely amazing…Thank You!
I live in central Wyoming and we are already 2 weeks past the date we "historically" get our first snow, and a week past our "average" first snow. We are 15- 20 degrees warmer than average and have been for a month.
Include Canada please
Skip to 7:26.  My god, the filler, the eclipse, the nonsense..... talk about harvesting.
Lol, I like the lake effect snow line the entire west side of Michigan has.
Thanks for your help with my Snowboard Season projections!!!!✌✌🎣
1st Snow (dusting) MT.BALDY CA October 1, 2023 May be another epic ski 🎿 season in Angeles National Forest 😉👍 just a few dozen miles from LA/ OC. Real Mountain Skiing, Real Close 🏔
hmm you see, Im in northern NJ, in the brown vote zone of your map. I think we're gonna have alot of snow this year
I use welding helments for solar eclipses.  Or you can just buy a lens and hold it in front of your eyes.
The pin for Nashville, TN was way off. Lol. Love your videos. (Not sarcastic)
I've lived in Southern New England my entire life, only 30mins south of Boston. I'm used to snow at this point haha I remember 2014/2015 constant snowstorms.
How did you miss the rain that flooded NY Friday?
Normally Quebec Saint hyacinthe the first snowfall falls on November 25th these last two years it is not known 😂
Will Dallas be getting a lot of snow this winter?
Damn this is very accurate you were 1 day off with snow on oct 1st
Thanks for the Peoria Shoutout!!
We had a storm com through last days and a few of the mtn ranges east of fallon ,NV had gotten snow up too. I was really surprised to see it this early. Thanks for all your information on weather you’re the only weather channel I watch
Could you include parts of Canada? I love your channel!
Yeah...no.
January 3rd? Ok ill mark it😂
bro i live in louisiana....we go years without seeing snow.....2019 was the last time i think we did? maybe 2020
It has definitely already snowed up on my local mountain in NW Montana. Looking like it may snow in the valley tomorrow per your prediction
Cheers from N.E. Oregon can confirm it's been unseasonably cold and wet. Can snow any minute really. 🎉😢 So much snow shoveling.
I'm gonna keep an eye for that prediction. we'll see how good you are
RYAN - FYI thanks for the great info. I have one suggestion for you. There are a lot of colorblind people that have trouble with maps like the one you used to show first snowfall. We need high contrast and or hash marks or some other type of pattern. For me Nov 1, Nov 16 and Dec 15 look almost identical in the key, on the map it was a little difficult to discern, the same with Dec 1 and Dec 15. Thanks.
Wonder why NY is not included in the snow forecast.
I have seen it snow in Florida  not stick but it did snow.
Can’t wait for the snow!   ❤ from Maine
i think this is inaccurate as i live in ottawa canada and its full blown 25 celsuis
I predict snow will first falls when it’s viewable…no sooner..no later.
So it's gonna snow on my birthday, again yayyyy 🤣
I m not living in America  why you dont show and Europe the world is not only America ;)
We've already seen snow here in the mountains in Utah.
There was some kid that went blind at my school looking at the solar eclipse without glasses.
Nashvillian here… you better be right. I want my snow darnit
Ryan, are the solar sunglasses the same type that the eye dr gives you when they dilate your eyes for eye exams? I’m retired & can’t afford to buy much of anything extra but I have several pair from the eye doctor. Thanks. Love your channel. You’re my number one!
As a back seat meteorologist, I can comfortably predict that there is a 50/50 percent chance its going to snow/sunshine this winter.
Snow arrived up high in the mountains not sure if they are just across the border in Canada or in Eureka, MT
Went to the full Solar Eclipse in North East Georgia on August 21st 2017, it was amazing, 1 of the coolest things I have ever seen.
I hate the cold anyway, can't stand 69 or lower born and raised in 100 degree climate
I live in the pink/salmon color area, we never get snow, and I hate it. I love snow and want to move somewhere where there is snow every year.
Welp. There go my hopes for a cold, snowy winter. Lemme just... *walks into another room* (Clattering, shouting, various profanities) *walks back in* Ah, well, guess I can still cross my fingers for a white Christmas.
I'm  in the Midwest and we usually  get our 1st ❄️  on 12/27 🌨
My phone has that filter built in. Yay!
Could you please do a Canada episode?
I live in Texas, so unfortunately never😩😩😩
I just put it on my calendar for Nashville, I will come back here!
Bring it.  I am so sooooo sick of this crappy humid hot weather in Kentucky.  I need to move back to Chicago.
i didn’t know i was a weather weenie
We're in Denver and should be in the early zone,  but if standard is October 2nd, I really really doubt we'll have snow just yet. It's been in the 80s most days for nearly 3 weeks! Any special considerations for Denver ?
I can't believe you just called me a weather weenie 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why snow is the least danger: search for "The Great Disasters (Part 5)"
Having lived through a number of El Niño winters here in the Pacific Northwest (e g. Seattle and adjacent mountainous terrain tm in the Cascade & Olympic mountains), I can assure you that El nino winners are far WARMER than average in this part of the world.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_the_El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation_in_the_United_States
Weather weenies check in🙋🏽‍♀️!
Interestingly enough, Denver is in the grey zone with an October 2nd date (tomorrow), but is also on the edge of the blue zone for 1 to 2 weeks early, but it hasn't snowed here yet, and it doesn't look like it'll snow within the next couple of weeks. I know this stuff is highly subject to many complex variables, but I just found that interesting.
I am El Niño which means... the Niño  😂 iykyk
For the last few years in Dallas it has been happening at the beginning of the year. Which is perfect for me, new vacations roll in and I take off during snow days
I’m in southeast Michigan and our first snow has been before Halloween every year
why don't you include Canada?????😭
Is it safe to travel from Aurora to Alabama?
YES THANK YOU SO MUCH I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!!!!!
I’m in Maryland and we always get snubbed from snow. I hope we get a blizzard this year.
I was up in the mountains working that last solar eclipse. After trying to stare at sun I used my black Togo lunch Tupperware and it was actually pretty amazing. The perfect view
I mean you were pretty far off lasts years prediction in Oklahoma. I even commented and told you lol
Texas snow prediction just says "sporadic".  Dates, Ryan, dates!  I don't want to freeze cause I'm not prepared.
It is not a forecast is you are in on the game.  It's called Weather Control, Department of the Navy.
I'm 30 miles west of Nashville, so I will be checking 😊
Nooooo I want snow in upstate New York soooo bad :(
First snow in the midwest can be crazy. I've seen winters where it's green until the end of january, I've seen heavy snow half way through october that's gone by Halloween. I've seen winters that are just near constant ice storms without much snow.  Last few years have been pretty tame though. I wouldn't mind a bit of a crazier winter cause this autumn has been hot as hell.
It sucks that you go out of your way to delete the weather patterns in Canada. Typical American.
I'm glad this doesn't apply to Canada.
I live in SW Wyoming and the weather has been beautiful, had some rain over night and its chilly today but no snow. The forcast over the next 10 days has temps in the 60's.
IM CRYING NOOOOO. I DONT WANT TO SEE SNOW TOMORROW I SWEAR TO GOOOD
It snowed in western Montana on the 21st of September, so the prediction was pretty accurate.
Wait, yall can actually tell where the first snowflake lands? How? Please explain...
i thought this winter was supposed to be a lot colder since is was extremely hot this summer??
I live in east Tennessee snow ❄️ fall down on January 4 2024 because I'm four hours why you said it would snow if 10:33 in Nashville
what about alaska lol
Interesting.  It looks almost as though weather is getting back to what it was when I was a little girl.  I grew up in middle Tennessee, and I remember getting snows from the time I was 8 years old to my 20's where the snow came up to the knee.  By the time I hit my 40's we got primarily ice, and people could be without power for days......it was sure beautiful with all the crystals on trees, but not so welcome because of the damage it caused.
The first snow will come in winter. As usual.  You’re welcome.
What a great and interactive map!!! Thank you!! Can't wait for some snow!!
Hi
Illinois in the house!
Love your videos,  just ordered my glasses for April,  that was easy,  hope you're right about winter. Hugs'n love from your upstate NY fan 🤗🥰
I love to watch your weather reports.   Thank you for sharing with us.  Have a great day ❤❤
Live in Knoxville, TN, still will be a similar date.
Hi I'm in the green if we get snow it's late Jan early feb
Really now, who was the dufus, the one making 20$ a pair vending eye protection at the event or the people buying them that did not consider they needed eye protection to watch the moon cover the sun?
Snow, not so bad- ice all winter, big problem!
I just hope that flordia will actually have a cold winter im sick of the heat
i just hope that i can get my half marathon in early november without a ton of sonw.. im in the later than average area that you expect.. we will have to see!
No way dude you can't use glasses!!! You wont see the full Corona! Definitely don't wear the glasses, just don't look until it gets dark
Holy shit, the snow stops right at the boarder!!! no snow in Canada this year!!! Thanks Dick!
Is it possible to predict how much?
Bruh. Come on. You’re just citing historical averages. I could have went to Wikipedia for that info. I was looking for bold weather predictions.
I have a request please. Would it be possible to extend the weather map into Mexico or Canada? The first snow graph was amazing but it stopped at the boarders. Love the channel here in Utah.
This dude does nothing more than tell you that snow is expected to fall on X date because it normally falls on X date…  Why does he have millions of views? Are yall that impressed by the pretty color maps? 😂😂
Ryan is the #BEST 🙋🏽‍♀️💯💯
I mean, living in northern Minnesota, it really doesn’t matter a whole lot when we get snow or how much we get, cause even on the least snowy years we will get a few feet. I care more about the temperature than the snow fall. Snow will be plowed and handled, but if the temperature is too warm, I worry about black ice. It’s usually not a problem cause the roads will be salted, but I learned the hard way that some roads don’t get salted.
I live in the Southwest Virginia, we ain't had snow in about 5 years now. We need SNOW and lot's of it please...
I just bought a snowmobile so for anyone im my area your welcome. Your not gona see snow for years.
Climate change is absolutely nothing to do with us. This cycle has been happening for millions of years on this earth.
I am a Weather Weenie. Ryan is the Best
Thank You for the link! Got the 5 pak! Getting ready for 2024 event in Ohio.
As a Nashvillain, bet.
Ryan Hall and WeatherUnderground works for me, Ryan for the Big Picture and WU for local detail.
I live in Reno and Mt rose already got snow a couple weeks ago
Being in Wichita, KS, we are ALWAYS on the cusp of every graphic. So maybe average snow days, maybe later.  I want to know if we in Wichita are going to get milder temps than normal. It affects my projects order!
It already snowed on mt timpanogos in utah sept 4 of this year.
Buh Muh global boiling!
Living in Wisconsin/Michigan and not getting snow presses me :(
Overall good video and had fun watching it even im from Europe
@Henry Donahue
More west coast please ❤
Can you please extend your predictions into Canada?
Here in Maine, I've seen mid- October snow and mid-May snow. Normally, November is the first snow and April is the last. Either way it's like living in a freezer where no one opens the door for many months! 🌲❄️
I ive in Nash.
I’m a union electrician from Chicago and I’m glad I tune in, cuz I work outside in the elements sometimes and I know what to expect and get my gear ready for work
Here's when.
October 25th... first one inch of snow on pavement in North Central MA.   Temps will support it during the overnight hours and the straight up trains of rain we've been getting will continue... they'll meet up on a very cold Oct 25th early morning and produce enough snowfall to get pavement coverage... if only until the Sun rises.
Bro hopped into his Time Machine to go to the future to find out precisely when the first snowflake was going to fall in Nashville
Ha. I was also on Tennessee when the last full solar eclipse occurred. What a sight.
That’s unfortunate for snowboarding season
O come on I feel like new York has sucks for snow the last 4 years.  I just wanna ride my snowmobile!!!!
Man, I’m going to hold you to that snowfall date. I’m just south of Nashville, Tn and it’s pretty unpredictable around that time.
My niece is getting married the evening of Nov. 10 at 4pm outside.  Of course we are in the area in NY that we get lucky to get snow Oct. 31.  Crossing every every finger and toe we aren’t freezing our bums off.  But, I have a strong feeling no one is going to hear a thing due to the teeth and bone chattering/clinking.
NASHVILLE CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!
I just moved Alaska, what are we chopped liver? I know that our population is small but we need weather forecasts too.😢
Good job. Very interesting... all the way to the end.
In SW Montana we could get snow on the Fourth of July. We got our first snow last weekend lol
This man really just called Paris, Tx "Dallas"
It’s our last winter in central Ny and I will be so happy if the snow holds off at all!
I'm sticking to my prediction of November tornadoes/severe thunderstorms in Eastern South Dakota.
Snowed in Las Vegas NV yesterday. Dude is good. I’m a trucker and I trust this guys long term predictions.
I love the predictions at the end of the vid. If they turn out to be that insanely accurate I will lose my marbles
I got a perfect pic of the eclipse back in 2017. It is an all time favorite of mine.
Good news for my Tahoe ski trip 2nd week of December.
Colorado already had snow this year... So this guy is lying to you all. Dont believe any of youtube b.s... Its all propaganda
Thank God,  I move out of Boston I am done with snow shovel and wake up early to start my car and clean the snow off my car before leave work.🙏🙏🙏🙏
In Nashville....waiting for January 3rd!!!
I guess it doesn't really matter much since the color key on the map goes from south to north, but I'm colorblind and I can't tell the difference between some of the key colors.  The Dec 15 and Nov 16 colors are mostly identical to me, and the Dec 30 and Dec 1 colors are as well.
Kentucky
Wish you could do the uk because they weather forecasts have been well inaccurate, believe it’s to do with El Niño
Every year it seems like the chicago suburbs have seen less and less snow, I really hope this year we get a lot more than usual!
I will live in the ABSOLUTE MIDDLE of the total solar eclipse
When I went to see the 2017 eclipse, I neglected the glasses until the last minute. I stopped at every station on the way down, but they were all sold out. That's when I spotted a NAPA store. I bought a glass welding lens ans it was perfect!
If you’re in north Florida can you see either eclipse?? Prob not, right? I am a weather nerd. Always looking it up. I wish it got colder here. I hate hot 🥵 weather! It’s so ironic I live in fl my whole life. I love it when it’s cold. I stay inside when it’s hot all summer & barely go outside. I H8 it. But don’t want to move bc where I live is perfect, besides that.
Snow has hit Montana already…
Like last year Tennessee got hit with a snow storm in the month after February in march
So far, you've been pretty spot on for the most part on your forecasts for my area. But with your new forecast stating that we're going to have a warmer winter than average. It doesn't seem to mess up with what mother nature seems to be telling everybody in my area. We're bending down the hatches for a very cold winter.  Everything in nature is saying it's going to be very cold. Bugs, the birds, the plants. Everything seems to be preparing to have a colder than average winter.  I guess in a couple months. We will see who is more correct. 😊
I live in north Florida, so we never get to see ❄️!! It sucks. I love cold weather.
So North Carolina isn’t getting any snow? :(
I'm a weather weenie!!! 😁
I'm already waxing my skis
A weather channel on trending is insane💀
Great I'm in the sierra foothills and we got just buried this last march deepest snow folks have seen in 50 years. Roofs collapsed trees crushing homes and cars, bloody awful. I'm a fan of snow but not like that, some places got 12 ft in one week. I don't believe I have seen a 12 ft Y'all O Meter.
I'm a Weather Weenie!
IM NOT A WEATHER WEENIE!!! I just like outside activities… lol
weather weinie!!!!
I'd still like to generally know what weather will happen in Canada, unless that just doesn't exist on the globe anymore -_-
PEORIA IL finally
Well, Utah got snow like a month ago, so...
South west Florida be like - Snow what a conspiracy that is
Weenie fine pass the 🌭 😂
Yeah. The doofus was the guy that got $20 in the parking lot😂
I really hate how right you are about these. Last week was our last week of heat. The forecast all next week goes as low as 29 degrees. It’s only October first.
Blahahahabababa I guarantee it will snow like every year 😂
A weather reporter can be wrong 65% of their time and still keep their job
The Detroit Michigan area received 8 inches all winter. last year
I WANT SNOW!
We just want a colder winter in Florida😭🥶
I live in Harlan Kentucky and I want to see a huge snow ❄️ this year.
I’m hoping we get way more snow a lot sooner in Nashville
So basically the weather is going to reset and kill most of us off like 2012 movie
I’m expecting no snow in western Washington state 😢
I feel so called out. Why'd you have to do it that way? 😀
Got 'my' VisiSolar glasses---for my ofc mgr who is a 'sky geek' Can't wait to see when Columbus OH actually gets 1st snow to see if you're spot on. We always seem to get one early snow, then nothing more until January.
Do you think coastal Virginia, specifically Williamsburg VA will see any snow this year? We have very mild winters and haven’t seen snow in several years 😢
Omg El Nino has been issued since 1995
Nah West Virginia? We mountains boutta get hypothermia
here's to hoping there is a record snow storm. We having had any substantial snow in southern Indiana in quite along time.
Well, if I were a betting person, I would bet the south the sees their best chances in December. After that it vecomes too mild. Seen it often with ElNino. Also depends upon which zone of ths Pacific warms the most. The Eastern zone of the Pacific warms the most, there will not be much snow at all in the south.
Why cause they manipulating the weather so where there’s more damage control ppl pay the price I see😂good luck
snowed today in southrn utah in the mountains it was very little tho. half inch maybe (im from hawaii so this is new to me XD)
So like… do you think Mississippi will get snow this year….? 😬
It hasn't snowed in Massachusetts until late January the past few years
What happened to the big daddy snowstorm when you said that the west was in the bad
This guy is phenomenal! made me a weather weenie 🤣 ty
Im in Nashville.  I"ll hold you to this.
This guy's favorite movies are cloudy with a chance of meatballs 1 and 2 forsure.
This is terrible news I hate snow
I need 4 ft of snow this year all at once. -30 temps
heading to Tennn. Oct. 17th came here hoping I would hear reports of early snow fall by then.  Went away SAD & DISAPPOINTED!   Florida boy just not meant to see snow I reckon.
Man had been on the money every damn time
I also happened to see the 2017 solar eclipse, it was pretty cool.
We Didn’t Get No Sleet,Ice,Freezing Rain Or Snow Last Year SO?😮Not Holding My Breath For This Year Neither😢NC
The last 3 years, here in North Texas, we’ve been getting an insane amount of snow, in 2020 we had a massive snowstorm that covered the whole state, 2021 we had another smaller one, 2022 we had another big one, and in 2023 we had a somewhat heavy snow. So I wonder if this year if we are gonna get another snow storm.
no im a weather wee wee!! lol thank for info
Westmoreland,Tn Macon co
In 1997 Kansas City had a very early 10/22 heavy snow. I believe that was an El Nino year. Here the snow used to always beat Christmas but most years now it seems like only a dusting before January. We also seem to get less ice storms. Interestingly, that part of the plains is expected to receive more heavy precipitation events, partially in the winter, as annual temperatures continue to rise.  You've got Kansas City later than average, but I'm going to bet snow by 12/1. I'm tempted to say 11/15. For the record, it is 90°F+ today.
HALL'S WEATHER WEENIES  print em sell em.  I want one.
Did we have an El Niño winter in 2010/2011? Here in MD that year was the year of snowmageddon.
wow. never knew I really WOULD see snow for the first time in my life. maybe.
For 74 years in central North Carolina, I remember snow before Christmas only once. It was 2018 and we had 15". We usually don't have snow til January at least, sometimes not at all.
Pretty cool how he included the lake effect in his prediction!
We will have 2 total solar eclipse in less that 8 months.
Is Buffalo going to get more freak November and December storms. These pre Thanksgiving November storms are nuts.
Typical…..my state and area totally ignored
i feel called out at 810
I think Ryan only knows cities that are located in the mid to eastern U.S.. I assure you, we have cities in the western U.S..
Damn oh climate change or we now in a ice age again....
As a bartender/disc golfer in Youngstown, Ohio, in the last 5 hours, I've been called Lucky Ducky, Fart Face, Snotty Scotty, Scotty 2 Hotty and finally a Weather Weinie. I'm alright with these Terms of Endearment, except the Fart Face, bc I was not the guilty one. As the old saying goes " The first who smells it, was the one who dealt it".
It snowed on the Rubies in Nevada last night.
Will southern Arizona like in 2012 see snow this winter?
WELL JAMES Z DUFFUSS BOUGHT EVERY PAIR OF S.ECLIPSE SUNGLASSES AND HAS RETIRED AND OWNS HIS OWN COUNTRY!!!!
I have been lucky in that i have seen all the types of eclipses here in Ballarat Victoria Australia
Long Island is weird as hell when it comes to snow season. we either get our 1st bits of snow in late november/early december, or we get it super late in January and it sometimes doesnt end until like late march.
I’m in DC, and we got no snow last year. It was too warm. There was like a day of flurries. I don’t think we’ll have snow again. It’s staying too warm again. Maybe flurries. 🙁 Mosquitoes and rats love it. It never got cold enough to result kill them off. It’s been gross this year.
im from colorado weve already gotten snow in september
Looks at first map- "Ok so October 2nd"- gets to second map- "if in this area then subtract a week or two" *stares blankly* ... *peeks outside* If Ryan's right, my "Fall" will only be 2 weeks long haha!
Utah, we have had snow last month I think
😂 I lost it when you said the part about being a weather weenie! Yup! That's me! Love your videos :D
8:01  Sneak roast
Ryan halls wrong y’all!!
Wrong
No
😂😂😂 Love that first snowflake forecast 🤣🤣🤣
What about the temperatures ??
🙄🙄🙄🙄
Gona freeze florida just like 2000 #deniselong froze after cop moved her to moon lake from shovelhead party at hitlers😢 #dhs
Had no clue I'd be in the 70-80% range for an eclipse so soon! And my bf will be in town so we're gonna view it (safely) together!
Colorado has already had plenty of snow in the mountains.. Pikes Peak had a Blizzard pretty much in Aug lmao
I hope North Carolina gets snow this year  and next year😭😭😭
Hopefully I see snow in texas soon
"what does this have to do with snow inthe US? Nothing" i laughed so hard
i'm from East Tennessee and i'm a wildlife and landscape photographer. i swear the eclipse of 2017 was hands down the most amazing natural event i've ever witnessed in my entire life... and living my whole life in the Smokies, well.. i've seen some stuff. just sayin. i'll crawl through glass to the eclipse of 2024 if that's what it takes to see it again! i actually might decide to see it at 90% here since i've never seen that before. but so long as i'm alive, i'll be somewhere to see it. already praying for the weather! lol
Ho him. Another day, a different prediction. Which one is right?
Ohio?
i live in the green zone and haven't seen any since 2018 and it only lasted on the ground for 4 hours, i really miss it i haven't had a white christmas in over a decade
it was 103 yesterday, I suspect we're a long way out here
Why is Alaska always forgotten about? We are in the US we are a state that gets snow and I was so hoping for answers 😆. Usually it’s the last week in Oct though it can come sooner. It will melt through Nov and then that’s all she wrote til May or June
Bryson City, NC says mother nature is a scared mufker and won't let it snow here as always
Moving to Colorado really soon from Florida 😂 dealing with the cold is gonna suck!
You should include the lower part of Canada and Ontario how it effects us
i wish it snowed in florida
Sounds like you were the dooffus, and he was smart....
Thanks.
What about Canada?
I work in a park in the PNW and Im absolutely obsessed with the weather lol
not New York City? Why not?  phooey!! we haven’t had real snow for at least a decade! 🌨️❄️☃️🛷
Still waiting on last year's snow here in Charlotte NC
I really hope we get snow in Charlotte this year. It's been too long.
0:20 Never. Never is the answer, as snow in Texas is a myth. it's only ever sleet, ice, or powder that melts before it sticks.
I was in Jefferson city Missouri for the eclipse and they were handing out glasses like they were going out of style lol. I'll be seeing the next one in 2024 as well! I can't wait to see how well your prediction does :p
To be frank. Our weather had been so wacky this year that I have no clue what it is going to do. Had very little of a summer and about 2 1/2 years worth of rain so far.
yo whats orange, you missed putting that onto the chart
OMG! I’ve often wondered, but now it’s seriously legit. You heard it from me here first, I am a “WEATHER WEENIE!!”😂🤔🤷‍♂️
I’m at the store! Where are the Ya’ll-O-meter?!!!
I live in Fargo, ND. Oof 😅
I live in Colorado Springs.  Two years ago it was 85F on September 7th and we had our first snow the next day on September 8th.  Temps dropped almost 60F in under 24 hours.  Sucked bad.  Sucked REALLY bad.
I'm a weather weenie!!!!   I like your weather stuff😀
Got my solar glasses for viewing the eclipse!😎 thank you Ryan Hall !
Pennsylvania is gonna get some mixed weather this year
Our El Niño currently is nowhere near as strong as that one from 2015-2016.
What happened with NY they're flooded over there
r we dead to u ... whats wrong with canadas forecast
I just use a welding helmet 😂😂😂
Looks like you were in Tellico Plains, TN for the eclipse?  I was there as well - it was a great time!
Biden said it cant snow its all global warming
You are the more accurate than any network channel their is..  Plus I  enjoy your break downs and outlooks. Thanks Ryan, for doing a great job 😉🤗😎🎙🌌
I look forward to the solar eclipse and coming back here in January to find out if your prediction is correct! I'm only about 45 mins from Nashville. 🌒💜🤗❄️❄️🌚
I just bought a new snowblower so I predict here in south western Wisconsin we will see little to no snow this winter.
Hello! I was raised on weather reporting by Harold Taft in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. He was BRILLIANT and without all the stuff you have now.  Okay, that is my tribute to Harold Taft.  Can you tell me when the first measurable snow will fall on my farm in SW New Boston, Texas?  I raise cattle, sheep, chickens, and Border Collies and knowing when it's going to freeze or snow would be a bonus to this 65 year old, woman farmer. Thanks
sorry but since 1990 ive to disagree with your map, SW Idaho typically sees snow on or before thanksgiving.
love seeing delmarva/maryland shown, such interesting weather around here
Living right next to Dallas i think that means just no snow which I’m glad the last 3 years we have had some snow every year it’s sucked
I'm a proud Weather Weenie! 😊
Bro, you dont need glasses to look at the sun... if the sun blinded you, car manufacturers would have to legally put tint on your windshield. But, because the sun doesnt blind you, they dont and it is actually super illegal to have tint on your windshield. If the sun hurt your eyes, sun glasses would be legally mandatory. Stop caving to big sunglass corporations and believing the hype.. people that stay inside most of their lives seem to be really scared of the sun and that is weird af.
Aw man guess Baytown TX sees no snow bummer but love watching you predict the weather and your so great at this Tudor all your info .
I live in South NJ, 20 min from Philly. We had NO snowfall last year and only 1 snow fall enough to go sledding with my kids the year before for 2 days.  How are we looking in South Jersey?
I’m just hoping we’re not super wet in Dallas. I can handle snow. I hate wet cold. It gets in your bones and doesn’t go away.
Weather Weenie Yah!
🙏🙏🙏🙏
Your in Kentucky. So when do ya think our first snow will be, about when, I’m in Shelbyville
too early for the S Word
Yes! I’m a weather weenie
Kentucky, dustings of snow here and there gone the next day maybe a week or two of cold weather. We are not a zone 6 anymore.
It’s currently snowing in Alaska…
Dont you dare turn weather into sports bettings mr. ryan 😂😂
if I was closer... I'd go see the solar eclipse but in 2017 in Kentucky... but hopefully I'll get to see the next total eclipse in 2024... since I should be able to just go to Indiana if it's not going to be visible anywhere in Kentucky
I’m surprised there’s no coverage of the ny rain and flood
Had snow two weeks ago in the mountains here in Idaho.
Woke up to a dusting on the mountains here in Tahoe this morning!
I’ve lived in the bottom portion of NC all of my life and we usually don’t see snow until February if at all. Frozen rain is more common. We are close to where the bright green ends on the SC line though so I feel like that should move up a tiny bit more on the map.
A huge possibility for snow in Atlanta, GA? I'll take it!
I'm gonna need you to update that and please tell me Tulsa OK is getting some decent snow this winter.  We haven't had a snow day in years!!
I live in Florida so Florida doesn’t get too much if ever. I remember it in the early 80’s and everyone was freaking out.
i live in florida so I ain't gettin nothin interesting 🥲
Thanks for the video.
Weather Weenie here from Raleigh, NC. Fingers crossed for good snow this winter.
Sporadic Gang ☹️☹️☹️
I live in Waverly TN ,,,   I wrote that Jan 3rd down .. Gonna Fact check ya lol.. My prediction for snow fall in TN since I lived here all my life lol December 23rd at 11 am central time lol.. I'm just guessing BUT I hope you are right .. I so want snow this year :)
As a long time meteorologist, this is nothing but tweeked climatology. Add a little of what a typical el nino season looks and you get a video that you want to click on.
Winter flocks of birds are arriving in Florida.
In the gray area, i'm excited for snow already!
Snow already fell in the mountains northwest of Bonneville Salt Flats.
I live in the Minnesota River Valley and I'm predicting for us to see it within Nov 25th to Dec 10th and be mostly done by Feb 28th
Maybe we should do something about how the weather keeps changing
Hi my name is James and I'm a weather weenie. Trying to help my recovery and first step is admitting I have a problem
Disagreement here.  The whole planet has warmed up.  Instead of big snowfalls, we're going to get ice storms.
So so informative and entertaining
ive been telling people we were going to have a long summer and a rotten winter. No one believes me. So far, we're looking to still be hitting the 80s next week. (North of the fingerlakes) which is super unusual for our area. (I like to say we're in a weather bubble because of the mountains and lakes all around us) We'll see about the winter. I hope I'm wrong.
Y’all this is why I don’t like global warming chicagos getting late snow
Winter is great...if you live in a city and do not need to drive....anywhere....
Hey Bub, guess what? Alaska is part of the USA and it snows up here!
Im hoping so so much to finally see my first snow in my 43 years of life.  In the sporadic zone.  Moved to southeast Georgia a year after this area got snow.
The last total eclipse, I live in the town where it was supposed to be the best viewing. It was cloudy so the viewing was at its worst. I’m a school teacher and we were told that if the viewing was going to be poor, school would be cancelled so we could travel to a better spot. The traffic in our town as thousands raced to a better location, was unbelievable. School was not cancelled. Many angry people.
We saw snow in the higher elevations of Colorado last week, probably 13k feet and above. It was so beautiful and cool to only see it on the north faces of the mountains.
I live in Upper Sandusky Ohio and our town is the best place to see the next eclipse apparently all the hotels and stuff are already booked
Last time I seen it snow in Orlando was in 1989
I'm super excited for the solar eclipse! The April 8th one will directly go through where I live :D  I was only able to see the partial solar eclipse back in 2017. It was a great way to start my college career
The local libraries in the St Louis Metro were giving away the glasses for FREE in 2017.
We are not having any good snows for the last few years been tornadoes crazychaos in the winter time the whole planet is falling apart because people are ignorant called green to fix it when they're doing a speed-up of destroying it
I thot it was a El Nina??
What's the range for this average?  100 years. 30 years. etc?  I've Iived in two different dark blue areas and the last 15 years have been different than the 20 years before that.  It's more logarithmic than linear or maybe more exponential linear.
April 8th, that’s my birthday! I’m winning the lottery tonight!!!!
I just want it to be really cold down here in Florida. I been tired of this heat. I only go out at night to walk and it’s still warm enough to make me sweat. 😭
why wouldn't you include canada in the first snowfall... smh.
Mount Rose Nevada by lake Tahoe got some dusting last night
lol 😂 expert not really learning from the Master U 🌧️ ❄️ ☀️
I live in ut and we have already seen some
2 Hrs North Of Pittsburgh,Thank You Ryan❤
Funny that it's supposedly warmer and drier in the El Nino winters up in the mid-atlantic yet last year in the La Nina winter outside of a couple of frigid spells it was very warm and we hardly got any snow.  I'm starting to feel like I need to move to the Arctic circle to get my cold snowy winters these days.
Utah has already had snow in the mountains ... 😢
Another click bait.
The later the snow, the better. A white Christmas would be nice, but otherwise I can live without the angel dandruff!
I live in Michigan & almost every year our first snowfall is in mid October
😂 I’m a weather weenie! 🙌🏻
Here in wyoming we already got snow. there was 6 inches that fell in parts of the mountains.
when is Mexico getting snow?
Will it get nice and cold in Fl this year????
I live in Dallas I cant wsit for december 30th
Woohoo
Think it might be the same for memphis?
We, I lived threw the  lizard of 87 my sisters and mother and Dad did to thanks to our parents , who taught us how to survive the power went out the only thing we had to heat the house with was a wood burner stove we we so blessed.😊
Wow the freaking La Nina that's why our winters in N.j Eastcoast have been absolute shit the past 3 years barely any snow. I can't wait for snow love the winter cold winter not warm like the last few years.😊
We are currently in Florida, and it has been colder than normal, and the ocean has been cooler than normal. So, I would not be surprised to see crazy snow weather across the country.  We will be headed back to GA in the morning. But crazy weather.
I’m a weather weenie!!😂
last winter we had almost no snow in my part of Pennsylvania😭
I lived in Middle Tennessee during the last solar eclipse and while looking at the sun with those glasses is cool and all, not one person I was with noticed the crazy shadows the eclipse cast of the trees and leaves, and anything else.  Shadows of normal stuff you don’t ever pay attention to become altered by the eclipse and was by far the most interesting aspect for me.
I just want cool weather
I’m in central South Dakota. I just hope we don’t get a winter like last year
Your the Man! Good stuff!!
As someone in the blue, I may come after you Mr Weather guy. 😭😭😭
Weather wennie?!?!? Lol 😆.  I live in the sooner than average. Washington State.
Ryan is truly the Most Accurate weather forecaster and the most enjoyable to watch. Y’all😊
Well darn, sounds like no snow in Georgia. Darn it
For a decade in central Ohio, our first measurable snows have been the first week of APRIL. We basically haven't had a real winter for 10 years; more like long autumns. P.S. I'm from Minnesota so I know what winter is.
Dang it, I just ordered mine last night.
I live in Northern Utah, I think about November 1st is when I should start seeing snow. Stay Safe everyone
Totally enjoy your videos. 😉 Definitely a “weather weenie” like you said. 😂
And my favorite season is winter because I love snowstorms because I don’t have to go to school
I love how Ryan is telling us what we need to know.
100 bucks says this dude worships the square and compass
You said you mentioned the eclipse because you want people to experience it, not because it’s related to snowfall. Then you pull out some glasses to watch an eclipse and say this is today’s sponsor. 😑
WHY IS IT 90 DEGREES IN MINNESOTA TODAY. I’m so over the heat 😭😭😭😭😭😭
@Ryanhall WHY are you not talking and explaining this GRAND SOLAR MINIMUM to your viewers
Soo what qualifies you too give this type of information?
Having such a wet cool summer(VT/Canadian border) we are bracing for a lot of snow this year.
WHY DO YOU BLOCK OUT CANADA? Clearly you don’t want subscribers… unsubscribed
Oh! "Weather Weenies" - that's what we are! I'm glad there is a term for us! Lol
It used to snow in NE Arkansas most of the winter,  all the time when I was growing up in the 1960's and 70's...into the 1980's. But not now. They get more than we do here in Nashville, TN still...I hate it! I'm soooo sick of not having 4 seasons now. I'd have moved north years ago if I'd not met my husband and been the caregiver for my family members. When I was at university in about 1995'ish Nashville, TN had a major ice storm. Belmont Uni. closed for the first time in history! We rarely get any measurable snow here...so no different than any other year for us. I miss having icicles hanging from the house all winter and making snowmen. And snow icecream...mmm!  I loved the snow and am grateful to have grown up when I did.
I was able to experience the solar eclipse in Chattanooga, TN in 2017. It was amazing and I was fortunate to have a great nurse while I was hospitalized recovering from some serious injuries. She came in and gently moved me to a wheelchair and whisked me outside to see it.
I hope to see more snow here in NY and CT area this year
Ordered! Will tuck them in Christmas stockings! Thanks!
we"ll see. I'm rooting for ya
I live in Nashville, let do this snow forecast  !!!!!!!  lol
This week we had frost the land was all frosty but no snow yet 😂😂 Im north of Montréal
No snow in Colorado — not on the Front Range—too much smog and too many people.
Alright, Ryan.  I live literally just outside Nashville.... Challenge on!! See you on January 3rd😊
Haha i went to Kentucky from NYS to see the Eclipse on 2017! Still got my viewing glasses
I dont even remember the '03 storm butn i remember the Oct Storm of '08, and snowvember '14
Oh  yeah, I’m looking forward to snow
Need to get my yall-o-meter for this winter missed out last winter during the craziest Dec25 storm hit
Helena Montana here. We can feel it in the air. Im ready.
Ryan love forecasts more and more ads! I thought you didn't  need money but wow!!
You know Indiana said the Blizzard of 78 has been the most significant snow and I have been waiting to see that since 80 😂. I haven't seen it but when it does finally come I guarantee it's going to be more than the Blizzard of 78. But it doesn't sound like it's going to be this year
The only job ou can be wrong and still get a pay check
“Weather weenie” Deserve a like for that one
Ryan!!!! Please stop 🛑  It’s still 80-90 in the south. 😂
I thought new England was supposed to see more snow, but I guess not, 😰
Even with those solar glasses, you can damage your eyes by looking at the sun too long. Instead, look at the shadows of plants on the concrete out on a white paper plate. It’ll look like the same thing and your eyes will be protected.
They just unsubscribe me again YouTube is starting to piss me off
So does this mean we have Weather Weenie Hut Jrs? What about SUPER Weather Weenie Hut Jrs?
And I would put money on the fact that you are exactly right
Mid Michigan???
I live an hour south of Nashville in an area we call the "snow dome." We seem to always miss out on this big snow but just north of us and south of us in Northern Alabama tend to get more snow than us. 😢
Even Ryan's promotional bits are entertaining!
Or, if you get POTUS 45 eye lenses, you can stare directly at the sun because, nothing is stronger than Trump.😳😬🤔
Just give me a good, old fashioned Christmas Eve snow storm in Virginia that can all melt away of the 26th. Is that so much to ask for?🎅🏻🎄🥶❄️🌨☃️
Southern Ohio the almanac is what most resort to. Hopefully your better.
Everyone is talking a very cold snow winter by the signs of bees and persimmons.
I would like to see an actual official NASA document that says it approves these glasses, I am pretty sure that is out of the purview of NASA.  I live in Central WI, and the past three La Nina winters have been much warmer than normal, if this year is any warmer we will be celebrating Christmas at the beach.
Shout out from Nashville!  We'll see if that prediction is correct!
Sounds like the Storm will be up on us
He said same thing last year and was dead wrong 🤣🤣
Do they talk about this on tv in the southern states at all ?
He's right... I am a weather weenie 😢 (don't tell my family please)
Weather weenie! 👏🏻🥳
NASHVILLE GIRL here.... January 3rd it is!!!!! ;)
Propaganda.
I live in east central Ohio….last winter we got a total of 4” of snow.  From late December on….nothing at all except rain and more rain.
Im canadian and watch your forcasts ... but do you have any cconections with anyone up north to give updates on canadian weather?
No, I watch for other forecast for this winter and they’re standing above the Ohio valley isn’t gonna get hardly any snow whatsoever this year
What about the europe?
I’m more concerned about ice and power outages.  That’s often what happens in my area of North Carolina.
So many of my classes are going to be cancelled 😂🥲 Edit: or not!
It would be so great if you could include Canada in your maps. With our new proposed law that has facebook already banning Canadian news links (with rumours of Google soon to follow), you've got a potentially very large untapped market for Canadians looking for weather news and updates. I love your channel!
Why is the west always getting hammered with snow. East loses out all the time.
I used a welding mask when looking at the solar eclipse. Works very well
lol. South Jersey first snow the same as in the Mexican border. Makes no sense.
Is it just me or is there a once a month "NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN FOR ANOTHER 100,000,000 YEARS" event. Like quite literally every single month.
Snow in the rockies already
Thank you Ryan for your channel. I travel and I rely on your forecasts. And so far you've got me from state to state safely ❤
Ryan your right and I just realized it because im a weather ween I’ve become the very thing I wanted to destroy as a kid 😭
Early October snowfall is very common in the WV mountains.😊
It snowed 2 weeks ago.  About 2 inches.  I do live 11,000 feet up near Breckinridge co.
Today I was diagnosed with weather weenieitis... thank you
92F here in Houston and I thought something about snow, well nevermind.
🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭🌭 that me a weather geek
Where have you been all this time?
Love the channel when do you think Albany New York will see snow?
Im from Arkansas and this snow boutta hit different
Alright. I will see you in 2024 as I will be in Nashville then.
Good info. Just bought glasses and filters for my family. Thanks for the discount 👍🏻
I’m in CT. Our family is having a wedding in February. So I’m interested in seeing what the weather will look like that month.
I have lived in Dallas for most of my life. We don’t get snow. Some times we get ice. And it is closer to February when that does happens.   2016 we had .5 inches in Jan.
We haven't gotten a good snow in Kentucky for years now
You are the Best🎉
I'm reporting this video for excessive profanity.  That "s" word is totally un called for.  JK. Bless ya man. Love your content
Always hilarious to me that these forecast channels NEVER seem to include Alaska.   Sometimes I have to remind myself that we and Hawaii are the forgotten States 😅🥲
November Rain: Snow that hits the ground and melts
Snow? I’d take any measurable amount of RAIN for Texas..
I swear man, I just want it to be cold soon for fall
Ohio never gets easy weather 😂.
I'm a long haul trucker, this is my go to channel.😂
As a pool tech I really appreciate your channel!
The uinta mountains are supposed to get a foot of snow by October 2.
I live in CO: we always have our first snow around Halloween. Might not be much, but it’s still snow. Indian Summer come in Nov.
The

I’m looking outside….. apparently my first day of snow is TODAY! 😢
I think you do a good job telling the weather. I appreciate your effort. I rather listen to you anyway. Let's God bless you. Even my husband likes listening to you too.
10:33 at Centennial Park on Jan 3rd?! LOL!!!!
Waiting for your annular eclipse forecast so I can decide on West Texas or NM!!
I’m just wondering why there was absolutely NO coverage of Ophelia?
You can't possibly think you can predict weather I'm in nova scotia we don't get snow till December
Ryan -- today (sept. 30), the temperature in Lake Erie and Lake Ontario (depending on which station I looked at) is between 65F and 70F. Now, being an Upstate NYer I'm thinking - ok, we're got a warmer fall/early winter ahead of us. What set of circumstances will have to take place in order for us to get another Snowvenber?
Why don’t you skip all the BS about averages and focus on what’s coming?  Unimpressed with your El Niño jabbering.
“Weather Weenie” that needs to be on a shirt in your merch secrion 😂 or is it already and I missed it? 🤔
I live in San Bernardino county in California, in 2019 we had snow during Thanksgiving week.  I do believe that was during an El Niño event, we had record breaking snow early this year, it snowed where I live at 1000 ft elevation.  I sure love rain and snow, but this year it has been devastating for the people that live in the mountains here.  I sure hope El Niño doesn't bring more devastation.
Haha I think the really bold call was accurately forecasting that I am, in fact, a weather weenie.
I’m not a weather weenie, I’m a weather freak. I live near South Bend area and I predict our 1st snow will be January 3rd 2024 this year
I’m just SW of Nashville and work in Nashville so we’ll see love to see you do a segment on winters of 1977 and ‘78 as well as late 60’s you’d probably enjoy it
That spot in TX is going to get nailed with something. Xoxo.  Ps Sir, you are awesome!! We definitely would benefit from paying attention to moon... we garden better, hunt better and generally live better if we know our moon placements. Not just currently but, the day we were born. We can better understand our moods and preferences if we can understand what energy the moon is bringing into our lives. Just as the moon moves our tides... it also moves our blood and other watery fluids within us. 😘
Ryan I live in Huntington West Virginia you are a lot closer than the local station's on any weather that is happening
So, nothing new for southern Kansas.
I will wear my Weather Weenie badge with honor. Thank you for all the great info and look forward to seeing the results of the Nashville snowfall prediction. Cheers!
We seem to be down to three seasons. Fire season, hurricane season and snow season. Climate change is a hoax? Right.
🎉🎉🎉 I just found out I'm officially a Weather Weenie!!  Actually, I've known that since I was in the 4th grade in 1963, when the book I mail-ordered and couldn't wait to arrive was "Hurricanes and Twisters". Wore it out!! 🌀🌪️⛈️🌞
Thanks Ryan 😊
No no no no nooooooo.. south central Montana had snow on the ground in October of last year, and it lasted until the first weeks of April.. Not again, Please!! Lol..
As someone from Michigan, I need a winter where there isn’t a fricken ice storm or a blizzard. The summer here was awful, so many tornadoes and severe weather….we deserve a warmer and less severe winter.
Ryan, you have a 50% chance of being 100% wrong!
I won’t complain about Texas getting rain
Not seeing snow in Upper Michigan until late into the season doesn't feel right.
Lol. Now I guess I'm going to have to be hanging out at Centennial Park on January 3rd! ❄
Has Ryan addressed the NYC flooding?  It is bizarre
As a Middle TN resident, I hope he is wrong cause I want snow 😂
As long as there are no tornadoes in the South in December, I'm good.
You wear glasses for eclipse?? Hmmmm,  humans aren't very smart and shouldn't pay attention to anybody saying ya have to wear it glasses because it will not harm your eyes at all, yall be programed  !!
Apparently im a weather weiner 😂.  I work outside for a living.
Good predictions. Here in Indy, averages are strange and don't seem to be accurate, because we fall on the boarder between areas for a lot of weather trends.  I have found, in Indy, that the Winter follows the Sumer.  If we have a mild Sumer, than we will have a mild Winter.  This sumer was generally mild with only a short time spent in the 90's, which means that Winter should be mild with late snows and a short time of snow/ice storms.
I like the weather forcast. I wouldn't say add a week or two I'd say add a month!
In 2003 I lived in Kittredge, CO, and we got 7 feet of snow. Everyone's power went out for days, the plows didn't get to us for over a week. By the time they got there, most of the townsfolk came together and dug almost everyone out. People were cross country skiing 2 miles over to Evergreen for groceries.
If you can't get your hands on a pair of those glasses, a welding helmet is a GREAT alternative!
Why me watching from houston excited to watch but knowing damn well we don’t get snow 😢
America's Meteorologist
I hope you are as accurate about the winter as you were about the hurricane season! I would love a mild winter 😊
I live in the Milwaukee area and we usually don’t by see first snow until December but it’s gone next day. It usually doesn’t stay until late January.
Thank you from Kentucky.
Wyoming and Montana snow powdered the mountains last week
I can't wait for the April 2924 solar eclipse! That path is only like an hour or two away from home! Plus Heber Sprins is amazing in april
**puts on my weather weenie hat**   Also, I’m in Knoxville, TN. I’m in the wild card zone of TN 😂
I'm still waiting on rain in SE Texas.  My lot is dead.  No grass whatsoever and the weeds have completely taken over.
I just might take that Information to LAS VEGAS and bet on that info 😂
Im definitely a weather weenie. I'm more fascinated by weather nuances than the average person. I have my own bold prediction. I'm in Phoenix Arizona and predict that we will not have any snowfall here this year.
Higher elevations in Colorado have already seen some snowfall.
I confess, I am a "Weather Weenie" and I'm proud, to be one❤   I am ready to confess, that I'm an even bigger "Winter Weather Weenie"! ❤ Simply, because I was born in Louisiana and growing up, we only had a real, winter, about once, every few yrs & we only saw snow, once, every 6 years. ❤
It’s already snowed in Oregon
Oh bullshit you can’t predict day to day…….
Could you talk about how the Canadian forest fires are being affected by El Niño. It doesn’t look good this winter.
Being in Tulsa Oklahoma sucks fort weather prediction. Always right on the line for so many things.
We saw snow flakes in Pullman, Washington a few days ago
Yes!!
Here is something you can predict, when will we see Fall in Alabama. :) lol
Upstate NY, North of Albany, will see its first sticking/staying snow in January.
And what's this smoke I'm feeling in my throat??
I love seeing wet in the west!
when can i expect snow in Tampa Florida
SNOW! I love snow! We had none in central Jersey last winter, which was very sad. Glad to hear this year may be more "active," as snow is what makes winter worthwhile.
The Farmer';s Almanac - who's been accurate as Hell for over a century - says we're gonna have a cold snowy winter......
Let’s consider what is going on with climate change.  Weather is becoming increasingly unpredictable.  Thanks though!  Good starting point, no doubt!
I love ryans tips on becoming a scalper lol
Very few years are typical years by the very nature of probability.  😁
Southwest michigan here. Gonna be summer weather for next few days then finally back in the 60s and 50s
Here where I’m at in Ky we hardly ever see snow either. If we do it is only half-1” majority of the time. And I hardly hear Ryan tell anything about the area he lives around here. Then I would get to hear better predictions about the area I’m in. I don’t wanna see summer go yet 🥲 I’m a summertime gal,😂
i am even not living in the us butr watching this videos. I really enjoy it and i love wheather. Here i nGermany wheather is pretty boring and our winter is going to be terrible :D
GOOD. Cause last winter the tristate area GOT NOT ONE DROP.....nojoke.
When he called us weather weenies it cracked me up.
I live in central Indiana and my daughters school has a built in e-learning day for the April 8th eclipse. That alone makes me want to watch it. We missed the 2017 one because it was cloudy here.
I live right outside Nashville so I’m going to be watching out for the 1st snow ❄️
I just rewatched twister for the 100th time. I’m not a weather weenie 😂
What about Texas?
I'm in New England close to a thousand feet up. We usually get dustings of snow at night in Oct/Nov. A dumpalump is also possible at night as Temps drop low. I'm looking forward to the colder weather. It was consistently warm this summer, it didn't cool off at night. Probably because of El Nino and changes in the seasons. Seasonal weather is getting more erratic, Winter goes further into Spring or Summer goes further into Fall. I'm not saying the world is going to end. We need to adapt and be prepared for whatever comes. We also need to be able to talk about the climate in a logical and rational way and find solutions. Leave your emotions out of it, think clearly.
yup little PIG'S will fly soon
I live in Conshohocken PA, 10 miles from Philly, and we DIDN'T get ANY snow last winter. Not a flake. I complained, and now I'm going to regret doing that! Thx Ryan!!
How much inches do yall think clt gonna get?? or when clt is gonna get there first snowfall?
Wow Ryan, you're the best 😊 thank you so much 💗💗😊😊
Only God knows where or when it is gonna snow, okay?  Stop pretending to be God.
Maryland has not seen snow in 3 years
In Tennessee right now!! Traveling up to the tri-city this weekend and staying for a week
I normally get my first snow around Oct 31 around Southern Great lakes
I’m a weather weenie😂😂😂. Glad to hear the weather will hold off in Michigan a little as we are building a house and trying to get it enclosed before snowfall; although I do LOVE the snow and hope we have a white Christmas (there is nothing better)❤️
Annular? 😂 Nice! Thanks for the heads up on the eclipse! And for the new word I learned today! I honestly thought it was a misspeak until I looked it up. Annular- ring like
😂😂
Whatever NASA says I take with a grain of salt  🧂 I don’t believe have the stuff they say
I’m from Nashville.  I have put the date in my calendar and will be back to report
i'm not a weather weenie.  i'm only sat in the uk watching a video about when americans can expect their first snow :)
Let’s go yalll !
La niña = no NC snow.  I sure hope we get snow this year!  I wanna build a snowman
Dang I was hoping to hear Raleigh , nc see some good amount of snow . Hopefully this will be our year 🤞🏾
In western New York when, on betting  the 1st day of snow, all bets off after the 15 of November.
Yea right southern Missouri doesn't get snow
No way these are the averages unless it's maybe only the last 10 years I've lived in Pittsburgh my hole life and I can tell you back in the 90s and early 2000s we used to get hit around the end of October and we always go buried in snow at least once last year we got like 4 inches if we were lucky have the time it's not enough to even cover the grass anymore
PLEASE MAKE CANADA A REGULAR PART OF YOUR FORCASTS. WE WATCH YOU TOO!
I'm a Weather Weenie, love this stuff! Weather/climate effects us all, even if people don't give af about it, it's so facinating!!!
Dude I’ve listened to ur stuff a good bit and it never happens so plz stop
My mother lived in a perfect spot in TN for the last one. Now we live in the perfect spot for this one. I'm trying to keep my husband from moving in anticipation of the next one. Plus side, we saved the glasses. I keep them in my car to watch for sun spots.
Yayyy. Snow!!!!!
Thank you for all your weather videos.  I love your humor along with your weather knowledge.
NASA does NOT 'approve, endorse, or otherwise' any manufacturer or seller of eclipse glasses. Please do your research.
I love snow so I’m kinda sad that snow is coming later😭
I haven't seen a solar eclipse since the mid 90s. It was a strangge experience, and I'm looking forward to the upcoming one.
All I’m gonna say is this is extremely confusing sense my other guy direct weather is right now saying something completely different like it going to be colder is the north east and that it gonna snow more
I have yet to see this guy be accurate with anything
Over 81 degrees next week in Montreal, Quebec. So no snow for sure for the first 2 weeks here guaranteed.  Yeaaahhh!
The pioneers of solar viewing filters, I’m picturing a two groups of dudes and some inventor named Harry and he’s like next, there are some screams and tears and Harry is like damn that didn’t work, next now let’s try this pair as he leads another dude to group number 2 of blind men.
I live in Michigan and if we can make it past October 31st before we see our first snow then it's generally a good winter.  Any time within the first 2 weeks of November is perfectly normal.
Can we get some goddamn relief here in North Texas... I'm done with this heat.. summer just never ends
Indiana usually doesn't snow till Jan feb
Do Hampton roads Virginia
I live near Owen Sound Ontario and enjoy all of your videos, though I'm totally metric and much of your forecasts never affect me lol.  With that said, where we live periodically gets affected by Colorado lows, and Chinook winds.  I know very well what they are but it might be interesting for your audience as many may not.
I for one am tired of not seeing snow until after Xmas, I'm in NH and when I was a kid we always had snow in either October or November, but over the last probably 25 years or so it's been a rarity to see snow before Xmas, and according to this we may not even see snow until mid January at the earliest smh
If your next to a body of water look at the reflection.
Yes, El Niño is taking full effect here in Australia. Extremely dry here on the east coast
It's winter time!  East Coast <3
I'm a weather weenie! 😅
I’m a weather weenie y’all 🎉🎉🎉
I live in north Alabama where the weather forecasters get their forecasts right most of the time during the spring and summer, but who get their forecasts wrong half of the time during the fall and winter. So I find it hard to believe that this guy can predict the weather in north Alabama months in advance. But making these worthless videos gets him a paycheck from YouTube, which is the bottom line as far as he's concerned.
Hello from Michigan, I just wanted to give many thanks to Ryan Hall and Team for all you do for us weather fans.. Love and Blessings to All 🌍♥️🌄🌑🌕🌧️🌈🏞️♥️
Gloom and doom as usual?
Ooh exciting.  I’m headed to Utah (from England) in November, spending Thanksgiving with a good friend of mine.  I do hope we get snow!!
"You can buy a whole Dagon box and you can be the dufus selling...😅"  Love you Ryan!
I thought we would have a cold winter
Im I’m the center of the Delta in Mississippi where it used to snow every 7 years. Since the 2010’s it’s been snowing just about every year. Even had that crazy winter storm that froze the whole south for like 2 weeks! That was insane. Most people were without water for those 2 weeks because all the pipes were frozen. But then last year winter seemed to skip us. Had one day with occasional  flurries but the rest of winter was unusually warm 😂
You don't mention anything about Canada's weather, but the maps shown I can deduct that we'll have a later than average first snowfall.  Heck, we didn't even have a freeze yet, and the forecast doesn't show any for a week, which will be about a month later than normal.
That snowfall pattern is a history but not reliable now.  Remember the winter hold that kept southern US in freezing lows last early Spring. That is the current pattern and indicator of what is to come. Experts point out current upper stratospheric activity. Polar vortex is forming The equatorial QBO is said to be negative direction for next winter.  El niño predictions nonsense. The south US was supposed to be wet. Instead a record breaking drought and heat took hold.
YES RYAN . UP here .  near  ....LAKE ERIE  is unpredictable some time.     sometimes we see snow at hallloween time .  i know in jamestown .ny they had snopw  oct 31  about a foot  one time .
I was a manager at Wendy's during the last major eclipse. I bought protective glasses for the entire crew. We had a blast. ❤❤❤
As long as there isn’t any polar air coming down. Causing it to be -0 degrees with 60+ MPH gusts in WV like last year, I’ll be good. Bring on the snow!
Who really was the doofus? Him for selling the glasses for $20 or you buying them for $20?
HAHAHAHAHA no way the solar eclipse is SPONSORED. make ur bucks ryan.
That 2045 one comes right over me in west fl
I live in Atascocita Texas
What el nino and la nina mean- nothing if you dont live on the east or west coast
Amazes me that weather stops at the border of Canada.
Well I am at 5200 feet elevation in Idaho.  It's gonna rain the next 3 days and it will be in the low 30s at night.  We are on the verge of our first snow right now.  Last year we had a white Halloween.
They said last year was going to be the worst winter with lot of snow and blow zero temperatures and they were wrong now they say this year is going to be the worst winter nobody knows
actually when i moved  to the matagorda bay city area i was told oh it never snows here and its snowed once a year since i got here around march with us having that crazy snow storm a couple of years ago. im in that orange area.
Alright Ryan your forecast that far is getting a little too bullish but I believe in you
Eagerly awaiting to hear a mild winter for the northeast; fingers crossed.
El nino are my onoy shots for a white christmas in Philly…ive never had one…im 47 😢
Central alabama here, hope we get snow like 2016!
Man youre a weather weenee
I wish you would do the UK
hmm this is a bit different from other forecast ive been seeing. theres a chance for snow around the great lakes coming in about a week or so. will have to see how this plays out i guess.
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Ryan is way more accurate than the billion dollar news channels (ABC action news im looking at you) and for that I appreciate you 🥹💗 I actually gave up on trying to predict the weather because the news and weather apps were always wrong 😂 my weather app would say it’s raining and I’m standing outside looking at the birds flying in the sunlight, so now I finally found an accurate weather predictor
I'm thinking up here in the Northeast with El  Nino we are going to see our first snowfall around Halloween.
Highly doubt it
Weather wieners unite
Im in Mass. and am dreading the snow this year. I finally subscribed to your channel.
I’m in Illinois and it feel like November 16th is a bit late for the first snow fall
Im definitely a weather weenie 🎉😅😂
Thank You Ryan!!! I always enjoy your forecasts!!! Keep’em coming!!
YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND Southern Oklahoma Hasn't Seen Snow For Shit in 10 years WELCOME TO THE NEW TEXAS OKLAHOMA WE WONT SEE SHIT TILL JANUARY
This makes me sad
Thank you for the idea for my trip next year, viewing a total solar eclipse over Niagara Falls
You really are the most accurate! I look forward to your videos being posted so I know what's to come. I'm not happy about less snow in our area though. We barely see it as it is😢
I'm in SE Idaho. We had a dusting in the mountains last week. Damned furnace kicked on. I had to turn it down to 62.
Not a weather weenei just a nerdy geek LOL
I’m a weather weenie. Yea.
Hey Ryan, LOVE your content!! I have a question maybe you could cover in a video. I'm in deep southern Florida and the weather is way off normal compared to last 10 years any idea what's going on?
Well done.  Even though it was a clever commercial it  was entertaining 😂😂
I love looking at long range forecasts. I live in Washington State. I was thinking about that I was sensing that this winter could probably be hard. If we see snow where I live before December I will be surprised.
I just learned I'm a WEATHER WEENIE!!!  LoL!!!  Love the videos and the fact that you live stream when its needed.   I guess ive been a  weather weenie for quite some time now!  Ive been a spotter for about 20 years now. Wouldnt quite call myself a chaser.  I live in a small town in TX, (not too far from Matador) on the outskirts of 3 different NOAA regions, I pay attention to your forecasts, all 3 noaa stations and well...I make my own forecasts for my area. Im not terrible at this, but the way you break things down Ive learned even more. Thank you Ryan for your service.
in western Montana  oct to april is snow season.  so  this program is nothing earth shattering.  i'm glad it is this way.  thins out the flatlanders from wanting to move here.  they do,  but most leave in 3 years because of the weather.  high plains are not for but a rugged people.  just a friendly bit of advice
I’ve been saying for awhile that Minnesota is due for a Halloween blizzard. 😂
Please show Alaska.
I kinda got stuck in an...area where it could be Nov 15, or Dec 15. Honestly, it could be in between those dates. I live on the I-81 route, can you tell me if Im getting snow during november, or December?
You are a fantastic weather person
Ha ha ha, you are too funny, Ryan Hall. thanks again for that awesome announcement about the weather. way to go again. thanks .
Around the Yellowstone area we have been getting lots of snow in the mountains!
Ryan I’m holding you accountable for the Nashville snow lol
I'M A WEATHER WINNIE
I’m in the Seattle area. Im excited
Actual predictions   Texas rain fall will be minimal.
I’m driving through Utah down to Las Vegas at the very end of October through the beginning of November and I’m REEEEEAAAAALLY hoping we don’t get an early snowstorm. If we do, I hope it won’t be that heavy. 😂 I hate driving in snow so much.
NASA APPROVED 😂
its gonna be my first winter commercial fishing ky lake and barkley so i hope we dont even get snow or any ice really. lol but either way ill be out fishing. as long as the ramp allows me to launch.
I’m in Dallas and I just ordered mine thank you
If you talk of mountain snow, then we've already seen some accumulation here in Washington State (as have other western states). I suspect the upcoming winter will still be generally milder and drier for us in the PNW.
How much snow could pinch wv get this winter
Very accurate 👌.  I listen to you more than News channel 😅❤.  I have prepared and never caught off guard  Thanks to you Ryan 😅❤
Things are going to become highly unpredictable in the near future soul brother Ryan. I have a feeling that we are going to be experiencing some crazy hail this year. Back in the day we used to refer to them as brain thumpers. This is why we find mass graves of ancient cultures with   holes in their skulls. Most of these graves are found at the bottom of lakes because they were not able to find cover.
I am pro-vajazzle as many people know.
😭 I always look forward to my thanksgiving snowfalls as it puts me in the mood for xmas. I cant have xmas without snow. 🎄❄️☃️❄️🎄
I want to see a snow storm in Ga. like the one i hear people talking about that was back in the 1973... Just once a really good snow storm.. :) " yes i said it " lol
Come on Ohio get with the snow program😢😢😢
No.
I just checked the weather in Sierra Nevada, there’s going to be some snow tonight! Ryan’s prediction for early snow was indeed correct! ✅
2015, was an el nino year, also the snowiest winter ever in southern new england as well as the coldest winter in a long time. To me el nino vs la nina gets overhyped like crazy.
Never knew I'm a "weather weenie" before!
2:10 this is the most un-colorblind friendly map I've ever seen haha
Basically never snows where I am but I've got friends in the northwest and I'm watching this for them as much as me now.
Hey Ryan, did you guys expect there to be a ton of flooding in NYC, I was hoping I'd see a advisory from you about it. Or was more of a surprise?
Love the videos and I can say @RyanhallYall that you are one of the more accurate forecasters on Youtube. However, I am going to disagree just a tiny bit. I have lived in the Pittsburgh region since the late 80's. I am going to say the weather and temps remind me strongly what happened leading up to the winters of 92, 93 and 94. My area saw snow as early as Halloween in 93. My prediction is snow for the Northeastern region closer to the end of October. I am basing that prediction on weather data from those years I have also been observing tree color changes for about 10-15 years in my area and seen a correlation between when the trees start changing and the severity of the winter we might have. A late color change will be a milder winter, and if the tree color changes early the more Severe a winter can be. The Tree's started changing a couple of weeks ago which is quite a bit earlier than usual.
I would love if you added Canada to these maps ❤
Stop predicted
Mount Shasta has already gotten a sprinkling!
Either that or I really feel called out because you called my place not once, not twice, but on 4 separate occasions. LMAO
There has already been snow in Colorado this year . 😮
I'm near Nashville..north west ish so I'm going to Def write it down lol see you in 2024!
Fyi this episode came out before october has started sorry bucko
I don't expect to see snow until late October or early November. Montana is funny. There is snow in the higher areas of the Rockies off and on now, I can see it on the mountaintops. But, we typically see really cold snaps in December. Last year was the worst I've seen. It was - 48 at my house for days, -48, is F'n cold. We could use a warm winter. We had to scrape windshields this morning though. Still haven't closed the bedroom window.
We’ve been seeing less and less snow over the years here in the Omaha metro area. For the most part of the winter it’s just been insanely cold, dry, and windy. Like the last few years have hit record freezing temps with wind chill. I expect the future will just follow that trend and we’ll see less and less snow and dangerously cold temperatures.
I remember growing up in Indiana and Halloween was hit and miss with snow and thanksgiving almost always was snowy or had snowed just before
Thanx Ryan….😊
I’m in Nashville. I’ll let you know if your prediction was right
Let's seem some in Caldwell county, NC! Right at the foot of the mtn here! 😊
I was in Townsend, TN for the 2017 eclipse, it was amazing. Also, largest blizzard my lifetime in Alabama was 1993 which I am told was an El Niño year & we had Temps in the 60s the week before.
As a weather forecaster  Ryan do u believe in climate change ?
The 2017 parking lot man maybe a duffus but he understands supply and demand and had the foresight to predict activity in the cardboard shades market that no one else including yourself had noticed he is a business man and avid capitalist
I witnessed the 2017 eclipse , the drive from Franklin tenseness to Louisville ky took 10 hours
I remember❤❤❤❤
We haven’t had cold or snow or rain in 3 yrs
Welding mask will also work when looking at the sun
Maaaan, I don't live anywhere near Nashville, but I'm still gonna watch for your snow prediction.
Please God Md ❤❤❤
I'm ready here in Nashville ❄️ Thx Ryan!
Montana here. Already got first snow up in the mountains next to town about a week ago 😂
Before watching, I’m in Michigan and I always expect the first snow around Halloween or just after. Usually lake effect snow after a blast of cold air in West Michigan.
i would just like rain in texas lakes are starting to dry up
Hey Ryan,  Look at the long range forecast maps from the Climate Prediction Center.  They have the Pacific Northwest much dryer and warmer than average right through the winter and Spring.  I don't think your early snow forecast matches that more scientific agency's data
We've already had snow in the mountains of northern Idaho.  Wheee!
To be clear.  YNP gets it’s first snow, typically, in August.  Well, as far as I remember it.
Living in VA currently and I wouldn't be surprised to see more snow this year already starting to feel some cooler days earlier than usual.
Got my pack of 2 eclipse glasses! Thanks for the discount 🤗
We’ll get a lot of snow this year: 😊   I’m no longer in school: 😣
Born and raised in Nashville and I can confrim sir, that is a mf'n BOLD claim
Im tired of the drought and heat here in the midwest.  I miss rain and snow
I live in texas near the cross section of the eclipse zone. I got the Eclipser HD from American Paper Optics LLC. the company NASA buys their solar glasses from. 17 bucks a pair and I got 2. Was worth it to me cause they're hard plastic and will last a good while. 🤷 Texas better get snow. I had fun when I got to a place that wasn't without power lol😅
Okay I live real close to Nashville TN so I’m putting it in my calendar. I sure hope your right. ❤
im all for the snow
SHERMAN PASS, Washington State had snow last night.
That historical chart made me laugh, we havnt seen snow in my area around nov 15th in over 10 years. We havnt seen snow till january, I think last year we got a light dusting the day before christmas and it all melted the next day.
Wow how cool  I live in wakeforest NC will we get some snow
It has already snow on the tip top of Mount hood outside of Portland Oregon last week
(6:52) Excellent, let's chance of me having to drive through snow.😎👍
I carried my welding helmet in the swather for the last eclipse. I was just outside the path of totality and had missed a bunch of work, so i couldn't take the day off.
While everyone is excited about snow, why is it fun to be stuck in the house for several days or a week and the scary roads with snow/ice with damage to your car?
Ley lines and synapsis
I live in Bowling Green  Kentucky
Can you make comments on something besides just the east coast in New England because neither of these storms that you named did we get any heavy snow here in the center of the United States
Don't be using that "S" word around here!!!
Good luck with January 3rd! Send you a load of emojs to cheer you on if it hits your time line and now I guess I am a weenie, too!❤
Y'all already got it wrong. We got snow in many parts of the mountains in Idaho on 9/22.
Really?
NO.... next year! I do not want snow in the Midwest until after January 15th!
Can confirm here in montana we got our first 2 inches lol
I live in Texas rarely see snow in December
Would be nice to see some snow this year in south georgia
we think we know, then Jesus be like "Nah."  Nebuchadnezzar got it when he said in Daniel 4:34-35   "At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, raised my eyes toward heaven, and my sanity was restored. Then I praised the Most High; I honored and glorified him who lives forever.   His dominion is an eternal dominion;     his kingdom endures from generation to generation. All the peoples of the earth     are regarded as nothing. He does as he pleases     with the powers of heaven     and the peoples of the earth. No one can hold back his hand     or say to him: “What have you done?”
OK so I'm a weather weenie!🤣
Hi from NE Arkansas…. El Niño is killing my hopes for a big beautiful snow this ❄️ winter ❄️ lol.
Still high 90s in N Texas. I'd love some rain. Snow; I'd dance a lucky jig.
Thank you Ryan!
Taking time to play in the snow❄ is good for the soul ❤
I predict in my state of minnesnowda, it will be cold and it will snow. lol
I’m in Pittsburgh and it’s usually right before or after Thanksgiving 😊
Hey Ryan, Ive loved the weather ever since I was a kid and was wondering, is there a recommended program to look into for getting into the meterological field?
Wait a minute!! Climate change czar John Kerry said that we in New England will never see it snow again by 2005 and the North Ice cap will be gone by 2013
Last season the NYC area only got 2 days of measurable snow. (I think)
Snow in Rocky Mountain National Park a few weeks ago at 11,000 ft and above. But it wasn’t much.
Weather Weenie Gang
Why is Pensacola Florida in the sporadic 😂😂😂...we saw some ice on the ground last yr...but snow? Maybe 15 yrs ago...and before that prob 20 yrs ago😂😂. And that was like enough to scrape enough together to make a 6 inch snowman 😂
Love your info Ryan, keep it coming!
As a Floridian what the hell is snow?
Hot, windy and sunny where I am in Wyoming.
we damn it so im probs not gonna see snow until december??? goddamn it
Mammoth Lakes, CA. 3”-10” snow forecast starting tonight, 9/29 through Sunday 10/1!  One month early!!😮 After an 800” snow year last winter, we are not too excited about another mega winter.🥶
Welding helmet works for the solar eclipse
great channel
Thanks Ryan😂❤ looking forward to more snow forecast!
As much as I enjoy watching your videos, You got the pin location for Dallas, Texas wrong even if Dallas, Texas is still the blue prediction area.
I live in maine, nowhere near nashville, but i'm gon remember that prediction.
Northern to mid Michigan i see every year Thanksgiving snow due to traveling down to family.
I’ll believe it when I see it.
that solar eclipse happened on my bday, August 21st. great birthday present. got a big sun tatted on me too. sun 😎 asF
Ohh, Yes! So Happy to hear the Southeast is finally forecasted for Snow ❄️. You Made My Day!! Thank You Ryan & the 'RyanHallYallSquad' for making a Difference in our World Today ❤️🙏🏻🤗
I live in Nashville, i will go to that park at 10 on that night and record it for ya 😂
I just might have take a road trip to witness that first flake of snow in Tennessee!  Ryan’s rarely wrong!
I'm in west TN
Weather weenie here😂 Thank you Ryan for all you do, you save lives especially Truckers. God bless 🇺🇸 🌴🤙🏽
We saw snowfall in mountains last week of September.😮
Nobody:  Ryan:"Leave a dislike, I don't care!"...........Ha much respect and great job as usual, God Bless!
<.< >.> I am a weather weenie  0.0 😅
🌷Hard to find were I live when you leave North Pole Alaska off 💕
I'm in northwest Minnesota and always usually had snow by the 2nd weekend of October.  We usually have snow stay for rifle deer hunting which is around the 2nd  weekend of November to the 3rd weekend.  Deer hunting is like a holiday here. Snow helps.
Jersey is seeing 80s this week
Good pronunciation on Chicago. You nailed it 👍
Granny’s weather beetle is the only true weather forecaster I believe. 😂
hearing you guess say 3ft or 44 inches is a snowstorm. it just doesn't sound right (I'm in Canada) and im in Canada as in pretty close to the u.s like southern Ontario i have no idea how there is that much of a difference
NC mountains almost always have first snow around halloween
This is pretty accurate
Proud weather weenie ❤ I love your weather forecasts and its fun to learn weather things, you learn something new every day. Sooo accurate, then know how my week is going to be. Keep up your amazing work Ryan!
Dude is definitely no Frankie MacDonald!!! (@dogsandwolves) Best weather reporter there ever was in the history of time! Frankie is literally better than this boring blah blah guestimate.
I live in downtown Nashville and I'll be letting you know if it snows on that day lol
How bout that rain storm in NYC???🫣
🤔 Hmmm...
So although we in Indianapolis are in the late Snowfall zone. Can we still get above average snowfall
I liked your bold prediction. Please make this one: will it snow in San Antonio, TX this year??
I live in Fargo, ND where it can snow on Oct 2nd....this year its forecast to be 89 degrees. This is WONDERFUL 🙂
Just call me a weather freak has been one 50 years
Thank you Ryan. You are my favorite meteo person❤
Well, son of a gun, I guess I'm a weather weenie.   And I am totally okay with it!
What about trump He looks right at the sun  TRUMP what a Duffus
Predicting Nashville’s first snowfall; that’s a bold move cotton. I live 2 hrs north of there. I’ll let you know. I hope you’re right. That would be cool as hell. You would be my idol. Just liked and subscribed.
I too was at the solar eclipse in tennessee a couple years ago!  Was at a park in Lebanon and a cool guy was there with a telescope taking pictures of it. Was a very enjoyable event.
Wish snow on the crystal coast like in 1989
I'll be snowbirdin in Florida and playing golf. I see a snowflake and somebody's getting fired 😂😮
Okay full disclosure I love weather but I'm more of a snow lover than a weenie! Keep making great content.
we have all ready seen snow in the high mountains of NW MT.
35 seconds in and my hopes of snow in florida are dead
IAM  A KY HILL BILLY  NOT A SNOW WEENIE LOL   GOOD ONE RYAN
The 2017 eclipse was spiritually intense, I believe the 2024 one will be as well.
It’s not called minnesnowta for nothing…
I'm a proud 'weather weenie'!  My husband was a full time farmer, so I got used to checking the weather multiple times a day.  Three years after his death, I still check the weather a couple of times a day.    The eclipse is going to be amazing!  I'll have to add the October eclipse to my calendar.  We are in the path of total solar eclipse for April.  I work at a university and we are getting glasses with the university logo.  Can't wait to see it.
That pin drop is nowhere near Dallas... that's like east Texas, Tyler... which ain't near Dallas.
Great job thank you sir.
Let it snow❄ 🎶let it snow❄☃ let it snow!❄❄🎵
The last time there was a solar eclipse I couldn’t get my hands on a pair of glasses.  People were holding on to them like it was their life savings😂.  I had to look through a cereal box, haha.
Lexington Kentucky here full send winter here!
La Nina did nothing for winter in the lower lakes so hoping this El Nino will do the opposite of what is predicted.
Hi Ryan!  We are in the path for the total solar eclipse here in central Texas in April.  For those wanting to travel to see it, book your hotel reservations sooner rather than later.  City officials where i live are projecting anywhere from 700,000 to 1 million visitors in our city alone.  I can't imagine what other city officials are projecting for those towns in the path of totality.  School districts are even canceling classes for April 8th!  Make your plans now!  It's going to be exciting!  😊
I think you may be wrong about new England's first snow. It's been raining for multiple days here dropping the Temps and cooling the ground Temps in addition to the ocean. I may be wrong but, it's a thought.
I wish Alabama got more snow anybody agree
I saved my last pair of eclipse glasses from a few years back for the Midwest eclipse
Only thing I got out of this is the push to buy something LOL
Last solar eclipse I used a welding helmet. Multifunctional instead of a single use item. Even got pics on my phone from it. It was just tinted green! Lol
Weather Weenie! 😂 My first professional job was at AccuWeather in their graphics department. That’s what we called all the forecasters. Guess it’s contagious…
Maryland has been weird the last couple years we don’t count as predictable. Ny got tons and we saw just some snow.
I live live in a latino neighborhood , where u have  12 cars for a 2 BR apartment, so i guess i wont have parking for months id rather have the New Madrid fault line unleash fury
Please snow in North East Tx. PLEASE!
What about north carolina
I'm just hoping for no Arctic Blast in Okla, those are miserable in a structure not built for it. I am happy for the late snow prediction, and would really enjoy a return to a winter without a dangerous low temp event.
You got it going on! Let’s be weather weenies!!
When will Erie Pennsylvania get its first snow this year?
Why do you exclude Alaska?
I LOVE THIS CHANNEL! Such useful info. Weather has never been so interesting lol
BRAAAAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When has there *not* been el nino or la nina to determine what the average is?
Oh I get snow in january
The '03 blizzard in Maryland was sooo much fun as a kid. We tunneled under the snow and had forts with windows for launching snowballs
I remember the blizzard of 02 in pa and the 2016 one in pa haha tons of snow! people were using 4 wheelers on public roads and snowmobiles, its rare around here anymore
Portland OR is the unluckiest part of the united states in my opinion. We rarely ever get snow, I freakin hate it...
I’m a farmer and we watch the weather ever hour.
I’m in south TX so I knew the answer before watching, but I can hope.
Hmmmm maybe a white Christmas in Ontario
Hey, I was the guy in the parking lot selling solar shades for $20 a pair. Who was the dufus?
Already had measurable snow out in parts of WY & MT over the past few weeks
I have already saw a hint of winter on the mountain peaks of Utah.  Some of our ski resorts saw snow over a month ago.
Great and informative video, Ryan! Thank you for all that you do. Nashville, TN area here, I took note of the date you said and will return to the comments on or after January 3rd to confirm if you were correct!
helpful tip for looking at the sun... welding lenses work amazing
I’m just south of Nashville! I hope we get a bunch of snow!!!’
Live near Raleigh-  On coast has been getting snow around the 17-20 Jan. for  snow. 22-23 no snow, 21-22 no snow 20-21 Cold but no snow.  I remember the 1978 Blizzard.
You are hilarious. Love this!
Ryan, I have a request re: the eclipses in October and April. I'm in the right place to see one, and plan to travel for the other, but I'm super worried that we'll get nerfed by cloud cover, especially the one in April, and then we'll have a ton of folks scrambling for the nearest place with clearer weather if their planned location is overcast. Would you consider doing cloud cover predictions leading up to the days of the eclipses, and/or coverage on the days of the eclipses for the best weather conditions along the totality band? Not at the expense of your own eclipse plans, I expect you may be driving a bit to see the April one since it's decently nearby for you (I think? Kentucky, right?), but maybe just an informal update from the road that morning or something like that? Thanks!
I won't whine about a warm winter tbh
April 8th, 2024 also happens to be the opening home game of the new Cleveland Guardians baseball season. I think it would be so fun to experience the total solar eclipse with thousands of people in one spot!
I live here, I’ve written it down, and we’ll see how you do.
I am totally not looking forward to the cold weather this year. Colorado usually gets snow on Halloween night.
In eastern panhandle of WV snow was on the ground by Halloween, at least that's the way it use to be and snow covered the ground until about March and large patches of snow remain even into late April...that would be remnants of the 6 foot or so of snow drifts. Now there's more freezing rain and ice for the winter and far less snow.
I've never been called a Weather Weenie!!!
the last few winters in wny have not been very snowy...i hope we get tons of lake effect and them big storms...
here in the Pnw it has already snowed in the higher elevations, I saw some scattered light blue on the weather radar as precipitation passed into the cascades.
#proudweatherweenie 🤘🏽😃
I live in northeast Wisconsin, so I’ll be watching to see if measurable happens before or after November 23rd. ❤
That Nashville prediction was unexpected lol 😂. If it turns out his prediction was precisely correct, I’ll -eat- enjoy a cup of yellow snow
Do you think Florida will have a decent “winter”
I live in central west texas around the Abilene area and in the last 10 years we have gotten snow around mid Oct.( 6 out of the last 10 years )
Our AC broke 5 months ago and the apt complex underwent a mgt change, so it can't get fixed. We went thru August & September with little rain and lots of heat. The thought of snow and cold is so inviting. Please let this for ast be true (and let it happen ne t week!).
you have no idea what is n store for you  ill play it out
that’s a bold prediction cotton let’s see how it pans out
I am a weather weanie
In Colorado over here. Can’t wait for more pow!
We usually get major lake effect snow in Western NY (south of Buffalo). Last few years have been strange. Not much snow. We used to get 275-300 inches a season. Last year we just broke 100 inches. That's nothing for us.
Just a moment... I'm a "weather weenie"??? LMAO Yes, I read The Old  Farmer's Almanac, and yes, I have a weather radar app on my phone, and yessssssss, dang it, I check the 10 day forecast and plan my week accordingly.... sigh... guess watching your channel possibly could label me as such. Love your channel anyway, Ryan. Your forecasting is based in science and facts and I think you do an superb job.
Ya probably won’t happen ! 🤣🤣🤣
Any  chance central Texas will see ANY MEASURABLE RAINFALL ever again?
5:04 I was also able to see that same eclipse in TN, but from my airplane and at 9,000 ft! https://youtu.be/7mOxw6_xYB4
Ryan, perhaps you've done a video on this, but what is the cause for La Nina and El Nino? Is the cycle always exact?
It's been snowing here all week!    On top of MT. Rainier
I live in Nashville, I’ll make sure to let you know, and if you’re wrong, I want one of those solar eclipse glasses for free! Cause imma go to that April one lol
Well great...Im exactly chopped half and half...green..and blue...lol
Or we can watch the total eclipses live on You Yube via certain broadcasters that do this kind of thing.  5 years ago on You Tube a lunar eclipse was shown and I watched the event.  Anyway thanks for the information.
Well I live on the outskirts of the Lake Erie Snow machine and unless something winds us back to the 1990's I have little hope in snow for Christmas aside from mud and maybe half a month of surface frozen ground in Jan/Feb.
I hope that we get snow in southwest Virginia
Let’s stay that way, im flying from Seattle to Chicago for Christmas XD
I don't why it's so hard to get a NORMAL winters anymore. Last year we didn't get snow in Chicago until the last week of the December and even then it was barely any at all. As a person that looks forward to winter every year I just keep getting disappointed lol
I remember the huge snow storm of 2016. I was a junior highschool, and my car was completely buried under 3+ feet of snow in south central PA, below Harrisburg. Genuinely, I love the snow and I wish we got more of it. Hopefully this year we get a lot because last year we got (2) dustings and that was it.
So snow ends at the Canadian border? I guess America think  the  world ends at it's border.
I live just an hour north of Nashville TN and hope that it’s not accurate with the snowfall prediction.  I used to live in the north but not a fan of the snow anymore. Soooo…there ya have it. No Snow for Me in KY. Thank you. Lol
I heard this is going to be the worst winter in history, all over the world. I sure hope that's not true. If anything strange happens, I know what channel I'm  tuning into. Thanks Ryan, your the best.
I'm watching from Florida so probably no snow, but I am soooo over the humidity.
USA
Hey Ryan don't forget about southern ontario. I watch your videos too. Let us know please.
Global warming my ass.
@RyanHallYall.   CHALLENGE: Predict the first  Lake Effect storm. For the Great Lakes. That and only that will make you the G.O.A.T. WNY is watching 😂
Yes, I own a lawn and business that relies  on the weather, so I am a weather weenie, thank you.😊
The winters in Pennsylvania are scarier than a Steven King movie.😯😝🙃😖😫😓😯😮😱😱😱😰😰😰😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😵
What's a dislike?
I’m a weather Winnie!!
I am not a weather weenie. Ok maybe I am
I remembered the eclipse in 2017 I was a freshman in that time
Lol yea, I AM a weather weenie lol❤
So, being from Albuquerque, I can attest that everyone thing in New Mexico is accurate... except for Albuquerque. We almost never see snow here in November, or even December. January is when we get our one and only good snowfall. Then we head straight into summer.
I love the bold claims for winter snowfall. XD
Dang I guess Virginia gets left out of ❄️ I love to have some snow days off, so can you see what you can do about it please 🙏 😊
I was in Bowling Green KY for eclipse in 2017
It only snows in Vegas avery feww year. But the nearby mountains often get snow in early October above+ 6,000 feet elevation.
I still remember a few years ago my tiny human very tiny at the time, threw a tantrum about i couldn't make it snow. I hope we get snow, its rare foe us
Dude.... check the actual location of the moon during that eclipse you talk about at the 4:40 mark.  YOU will learn the moon has nothing to do with an eclipse.
Ok , I'm definitely a weather weenie.  Hehehe ! Thanks for all you do.
Driving is my bread and butter, so I am weather weenie ! Yep
Ryan!  $20 a pair?!
You people that don't live in the Eastern U.S.,Southern U.S. and West of the Midwest....just keep moving...nothing to see here.
Minnesota is one
4:30 Solar eclipses are awesome!  The annular solar eclipse is pretty cool, but next April we will be having a total solar eclipse that should be visible in a lot of areas of the US depending on weather/clouds.  If you have not experienced a full eclipse, please go to a location in the path of totality, it is awe inspiring.
🎉🎉 YAY IM A WEATHER WEENIE!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉  Also i live in Nashville😂😂
i'll remeber to come back to his around Dec 15- Jan 1 and see if theres snow
What’s up for SW Virginia snow?
Is Louisiana going to get snow too?
I hope he's right. Last year we saw snow first on Oct 17.
Love watching you, I am a weather weenie.
I just want to know when ryan is releasing a ryanhall,y'all weather app.
I hate living in Sporadic/when pigs fly zone.
Ryan, Could you please delve into the polar vortex?  How it might react this year and what causes it to travel so far south into the United States some years as compared to others.
I would like to know if you can give Canada  weather prediction to especially Ontario Quebec
If he gets that forecast right...
Wow !😊
Repwnt of your sins and accept the Lord Jesus christ.
LMAO  we already did in the Colorado mountains.
So a usual north Georgia winter
Man I remember that snow, I Live in the Mountain of SW Virginia we got 16 Inches!
Yayyyy, I’m a weather weenie from NYC. Thanks Ryan.
Hey Ryan, thanks for the reminder to get glasses for the eclipse next year. We'll be watching from the back yard, you're very welcome to join us in central Indiana 🎉
As a Dallas native, you're about a month off. More around February.
I pray we in Nashville get snow sooner. ❤❤❤❤  We did last year. Snow❄️❄️❄️❄️
Sporadic zone on the West Coast is supposed to see snow this weekend
What weather pattern were we in when winter storm Nimo hit the northeast?
Weather is about cycles. Peaks and valleys. Don't think this stuff is rare..
Yeay Ryan!!  I love predictions, right or wrong it’s fun!! ❤
I just cross my fingers and hope I can make a bunch of money plowing snow in southern Wisconsin.
So each of these bands are gonna be a range right? Is the Nov 16 band like Nov 9-23? Or Nov 16-30? Or Nov 2-16? I'm in the Nov 1 band, probably a bit closer to Oct 2 than Nov 16. So maybe I'll end up around mid Nov?
I’ve been waiting for a big snowy winter here in western North Carolina but it seems you’re forecasting a more warm and dry winter? I don’t get it, I thought El Niño produced more snow in the southeast?
Yep, I'm a weather weenie! 😂
Winter should b illegal
LOL! Bold predictions! 😅😎
Bought the 5 pack and thought the photo covers were monocles for those of us who are fancy.
bro if you predict that snowfall in nashville, you are the goat.
In South Jersey it's pretty darn rare to have a white christmas.  Our first snow doesn't usually happen until January.  Prior to that you might get some flurries or maybe a coating to an inch.   Having the white stuff not come down until after the holidays is always a good thing in my book.    The Jet Stream seems to always land on something we call "The I-95 corridor"  Year after year, most winters, oddly enough the jet stream hovers around this highway divide which can make or break snow fall in our area.  Fingers crossed that the Jet Stream stays 20 miles higher than usual this year.
Ryan my town put together and Eclipse Committee because we're in Knightstown Indiana and apparently we have really good views or supposed to have really good views of it happening the event, the total eclipse..so they have a committee put together to offer I don't know  music, food whatever they have planned.  It's going to be a Hum Dinger.
Just leaving commentthank you
We already got snowed on over a week ago in idaho and wyoming 🤣
Thanks for the heads up. Quality content
Oh gosh im a weather weenie 😅😅
I just totally found out I am a weather weenie.  It is true.
Just use a welding helmet.
We are in purple zone and we get 1st snow within days of Halloween every year. One of the top 10 cities for snow fall in US. Lake effect snow.
I'm a weather weenie because I have no choice.  I make my living outdoors.  I have to pay attention to the entire country because I'm an over the road truck driver.  If I wasn't out here running the roads all over the place, I wouldn't give a fart in a hurricane.  What's the weather?  Hell idk, look out the damned window!
Let’s compare You with John Dee
Ok I got that I'm a weather weenie! 😂😂😂
Bro, if you really think we are getting any chance for snow in Louisiana you must be smoking some of that good stuff and I want some.
I'm a truck driver, and if I had a nickel for everytime he was wrong, I'd be a rich and retired man...
Thanks a bunch!!
Jan. 6 11:38pm for Nashville
I hope my area in NC gets snow!!!!  ❤️
Crystal lake, IL oh yeah Nov 16th🎉🎉❤❤❤🎉🎉
UMMM what about Little Rock, AR?  I really need some snow soon.......
You're reneging on your previous forecast of the '23/'24 Winter regarding snow Ryan. Now your saying it's going to keep things "milder" in the Midwest. I've watched many other prognosticators and forecasters on YouTube and the majority of them are forecasting an Above Normal Precipitation and well Below Normal Temperatures for the Midwest this winter. I think I will just take this Winter 1 day at a time instead of getting caught up in all the hype and guessing. Keep plugging along though for the sake of those that Do get caught up in it.
Pretty early for my area in NW Ohio 😮
We don’t see snow anymore in PA. Was non existent last year
Wow…… Farmers Almanac accuracy.     Thanks.                                   It’s El Niño. We’re gonna have more winter.
October 14th 🌝
Well, my ducks are telling me that we will have an early start to the Winter and that it will be a long and brutally cold winter: They are just going through their fall molt and the feathers they are growing for the winter are massive. They start to look like feather-balls with legs. 🦆🦆🦆
Im in Southern Ohio  le nino always means wet and warm for us
So is Iowa getting snow this winter or not 😂😂 Ive seen a dozen conflicting videos and I'd like to know which snow blower I need to have ready😅
Yup! Mountains in Utah have already seen snow twice this year with another round expected this weekend! I'd say the 2 weeks earlier for Northern valley locations sounds just about right, I'm also predicting first snow right around Halloween this year. Planning those warm costumes this year!
MORE SNOW IN COLORADO
Thanks for the mention of Pittsburgh!
Tbh I like the @ryanhallyallxtra page better than the OG. We need more content, Ryan. Quit fartin off and give the people what they want!!!!
Hey Ryan, can you tell me what was going on winter of 2015 (I think?) Boston had the most snow in the country and our first storm didn't hit until January 24th. Then we had like two blizzards a week. We haven't had a decent winter since, imo. (I love snow).
It's a shame your weather line stops at the border. My prediction is that there are going to be lots of people in that park in Nashville, just waiting to see if your prediction comes true. Jon in rural BC, Canada (in the mountain, valley desert)
Alaska????
My first winter is Nashville (2016-2017), we had snowflakes in November, but the first measureable snowfall was right around January 3. I think you’re going to be pretty darn close!  Now that I live in New England, and after last “winter,” I’m curious to see how accurate your predictions are. I worry it’s going to be similar to the winter of 2014-2015. 😢
So it took till  mid 80 for weather people to figure out  el and la nina so if anybody  anybody that pays attention could realize they basically switch every 4 years so in theer mor year it back to lania and they will come up with another panic to worry about  . don't worry the weather has been like this pretty much forever . Side note I was surfing during Las eclipses you spoke of and below that was year they first recognized el ninis and nenio. Lol keep up good work and remember ski isn't falling I bet if yo did your math and studied patterns it's all the same give or take couple degree.  Thank keep up good work
I'm in north central Alabama, it's time we get some snow to. Moved here  2 years ago from Florida and only seen flurries 1 times.
Awesome… Looking forward to the snow in Nashville on Jan 3rd. I’ll consider heading over to Centennial Park to not miss it.
0:18 Never, cause it's a miracle to even get flurries in my area of MS.
Anything can change or happen with snow.. or we might have a bad cold snap with temp going below 10 or lower.
I’m guessing Jan 21 morehead city nc.
I was kinda bumed i wouldnt be in a good spot to see the wclips this year. But im in the oerfect spot for next years full eclipse. Totally worth the wait.
I’m not a weather weenie I just want to know when it’s gonna cool down in Houston 😢 I trust you more than local weather
I am waiting on total.eclipse next year.  I live within 25to50 miles of the best view of the eclipse
I live in Nashville and will be at centennial park waiting.
I don’t think Texas  exists.
😂😂😂
Can’t say I’ll be in Centennial Park in Nashville at NIGHT … but I’m close enough to hear about it!  Standing by with my Y’all-O-Meter ⛄️
I am waiting on that eclipse.  I missed out on the 2017 eclipse but I did see that partially.  Vehicle broke down on way to Kentucky
I'm in NY, and our past few winters have been kinda wet and dreary, so I'd like to see some snow.
Last winter was warm with almost no snow
Maybe next year my fellow Floridians...
I was in when he said “Weather Weenie” 😂😂
Cue Chris Farley.
How about some “Weather Winnie” tee shirts?!
Dude start covering more Canada or at least Ontario lol
oh dude that weird background noise you have is killing me. giving me anxiety to the max
How about, instead of us trying to back track to find this video, you just do a follow up and insert your prediction clips w/ actual events? That would be way more cool!
I just bought the 5 pack of solar glasses combo. I can't wait! Also, do you think there will be any snow near Memphis, Tn or precisely Oakland, Tn??? Thanks Ryan!
In Wichita, KS.  Our snow rarely starts before mid Jan.
Zone- North Western,  we get snow on the Valley floor most times Pumpkin Day- so it is not a fun Night for Kids., !
I'm in North Carolina so I'm praying for snow!!! Cold weather and snow ❄️
Last year coastal new england had only 1 snow day with 3 inches melting by the evening. We did have some crazy cold blasts though.
Thanks man for the glass discount
Hey Ryan Hall,  Can you predict when the drought on the Gulf Coast will end?
Ok im in north idaho and so if im to expect snow a week earlier than usual, when is that???
Funny, Ryan!
"when it snows"
I’ll let ya know ryan, I is in Nashville.
no offense, but the guy selling those cheapo glasses for $20/pair wasn't the doofus.
We arent going to get snow in wv!! As a child we had fun snows now nothing more than a inch if your lucky
As a Kansan I can say that we had our first white Christmas in 10 years last year and it was just a dusting. My niece and nephew have never really gotten to go sledding because we haven’t gotten enough for that in years. When I was a kid we had plenty of snow to do practically anything you wanted but these past like 10-12 years have really sucked for snow in Kansas.
I never hear about the Blizzard of '78.  It shut part of the Northeast for a week.
I love your videos Ryan
Guess what else  happened in 2016??? TRUMP!!!!!  :)  Let's make it happen AGAIN!
I had to buy a welding helmet for the last one bc nothing else was available.  I ordered a bunch of eclipse glasses and just ordered a bunch more. 😅  -the doofus in the parking lot
Ryan Hall ROCKS.
already snowing in the mountains in mt. can see the snow from town
Marking my Calendar. Really hoping it’s sooner 😝
Please tell us how Montague County, Texas received over 12" of snow Christmas Eve 2009? My first white Christmas and I was 60 years old. I've never understood what happened to cause that white Christmas.
Already snowed in SW Colorado couple weeks ago
3:39 44 inches if snow and only $15 million? Maybe missed a 1E3 there?
where im from in the northeast 2014 and 2022 were historically bad winters for us
Love Ryan Hall! 😄
I'm definitely a weather nerd. Thank you.
OOH! OOH! PLEASE SEND ME A PARKING LOT DOOFIS PACKAGE OF ECLIPSE VISORS PLEASE! I WANNA BE A PARKING LOT DOOFIS!
Any idea how many days will below freezing in Wisconsin this winter?  Just wondering how much I should push myself to get out and do my frozen bubble photography. :D
If you get the nashville prediction right i feel like it confirms you as either a benevolent sorcerer or time traveller here to warn us about something
Hu?    No just kidding Ryan, you are the top dog🎉
Here in Southeast Michigan we usually get our first significant snow right before Thanksgiving. 🙂🐈‍⬛🐈🌈💖
I still have the solar eclipse glasses from the 2017 one, they are built into sunglasses frame and high quality. I can't wait till the 2024 one.
Sorry … but the actual “duffus” is the one paying $20 not the entrepreneur selling them 😃
Already had our first snow here in Wyoming
This is not about climate it's about man messing with the weather let's take the Caribbean for example no rain in september this is not simple
What I will say is occasionally South Texas does get snowfall or extreme Ice. Does anyone remember 2020 winter we had snow in much everywhere and definitely ice with 17° temps. So not including us in the winter mix isn't a good idea Ryan. Please add Southern Texas in the mix. Thanks
Ryan Hall is a Weather King, Stud....💪📋🔥💯
so Caribbean is gonna be pretty warm this winter? normallly we average 23 degrees celcius which is an escape from the staggering 32 degrees celecius we have daily. So whats it gonna be
Can't wait to use my Y'all meter for the first time!
Bye Bye Global warming!!
Wooly’s in north east Wyoming 2 weeks ago
Texas sucks 😠 I want snow!
Greenfield Missouri?
if you include florida where it doesnt get snow then include the high rockies where it can snow year round
At least we know what the woolly worms talking about now
Dang sporadic area.😩
Persimmon seeds in west Tennessee are spoons this year.
weird one have been Halloween nada in the forecast then sleet snow mix mainly ice got creamed one year, that’s two week outage no power. definitely invest in solar generators because gas stations run out and roads are not salted in my neck of the woods. next is rv’s become life boats. you want an angry momma bear loose power no coffee see when she bites your head off first.
Me in southeast Texas sad that none of this matters to me. 😔
I've been there and you were right! Just a little tie traveler fun lol
It hardly ever snows here in Milwaukee Wi anymore.
Thank you. I can’t afford my heating bills so a later snow in western pa is welcome. 😊
I wrote this down on my calendar to see if it happens. I'll post an updated post to let you know if it did.
I got you a weather weenie Bruh!! LOL HAHA!!
I rarely feel this highly motivated to be a doofus in a parking lot. 😂
I hate being a weather weenie
Sorry but nobody is ever accurate about Texas 🤣🤣🙄🙄🙄
Im a weather weenie from Montana.  😂
1:07 GROUND BREAKING INFO 😂
This dude makes over 209,999 off 8 min videos 😂
I work in a State Park in the midwest, the squirrels have been working overtime gathering nuts, etc... thus my forcast is for a harder than average winter in the western corn belt & great plains!
Thank you, Ryan.
It has been a bust for us for the past 5 years I WANT SNOW!!! (dagnabbit) (central Illinois)
Long island won't see more than an inch until the end of January
Are you based in Middle Tennessee?? Thanks for the great weather forecasts. Love the channel.
Aaaaaaand another hot no winter for GA. Starting to think I am never going to know what a season is again.
Is SoCal CA getting snow like last winter storm ?
The solar eclipse covers Texas both times. What part of Texas would you say will see the eclipse both times. I’m in San Antonio   Love the channel!!
I live in Northern VT (your November 1 avg zone) and the last few years the snow seemed to show up later (which is the general trend over the past many years here). Im certainly not complaining! Its always TOO EARLY for me. That being said, last year mid December we still had bare ground. Hopefully your "week or two" later prediction comes to fruition here! Will try to remember to check in later and see what happens!
Black wooleybear's in Oregon this year..
Oklahoma was hot as hell in summer 2022 and we had maybe 1 good snow. 2008, 2011, and 2015 we had ice storms as well as snowstorms. I think we could have at least 2 or 3 snowstorms this winter. I hope so at least.
Do you have a hat or a t shirt that says weather weenie? I want one
Hey Ryan I'm from east Tennessee hoping it snows a lot here, I saw a all black wooly worm today...
Had to give this one a heavy hearted thumb's down. Why? 7:42 in:  " So, take another look at this map, find your location, and note the date." Wait, my  location isn't on the map?! Hey, Y'all, Alaska gets snow too and yes, we are part of the US. Yet, Alaska (and Hawaii) are left out of the discussion. Again. Considering how much weather in Alaska directly effects the lower 48, it would be nice to be part of the community. Please, consider including us in your overviews in the future.
I live in the North West of the lower peninsula of Michigan.. The past 3 years we've gotten a snow storm of over 12 inches by November 15th! Finger's crossed it gets cold and stays cold from X-mas till mid March! Love snowmobiling and Ice fishing!!
Considering that the mountains near me are now white…….. October sounds right. I’m going to make sure my emergency supplies are ready for more storms. But I know where my solar eclipse glasses are.
The F*** is a snow? Asking from south FL
We had snow last week in MT😉
East Coast powder days!
I’m expecting snow in October
OK, so I'm in North Texas, specifically the DFW...Dallas/Fort Worth...area, right at the end of the LATER brown forecast. But we alsmot NEVER get snow, so this forecast now basically puts us in the NEVER EVER snow....  Thanks Ryan, I was hoping for snow this year. But another great video as usual !
I can't believe you're swearing so much in this. I'm not ready for s**w!
I guess I am a weather wienie ha ha , love your channel Ryan
Thanks, Ryan! West TN weather weenie here 😂
I’m really hoping for some snow here where I live - about 25 miles north of Charlotte, NC.  We didn’t have one single flake last year and I was really disappointed (I grew up in Phoenix where it rarely if ever snowed at all!!,). Fingers crossed for this winter😄😄😄
It such a fun to watch !
YOU SHOULD MAKE THIS PICTURE GRAPH A SALE ITEM or provide a link for down loading....
I'm a weather weenie fa sho. And you're the only weatherman weenie I follow anymore! Keep up the great work Ryan!!!
Waste of time ya'll! He's just talking about a solar eclipse and trying to sell glasses!!!
god wyoming rocks
Snow is predicted this weekend for California's Sierra Mountains
POV: your not in the blue OR brown zone…
In the Florida Keys the only snow we see is on TV.
I think I know why Ryan is right so much... he's a time traveler but adds a margin of error to throw us off... 😄Hahah j/k j/k  🤔 Hmmmm...
Thank you, Ryan, for the heads up !!!
You broke my heart. I love snow and I live in the brown area. Also, last time we had a solar eclipse you could get those glasses at the Walmart vision center.
Why did you not include Alaska???
Please order some snow for Frankfort, KY!
Love your channel. Thank you so much!❤❤❤
I got to see the 2017 solar eclipse, my company actually supplied everyone with glasses because they felt that we needed to see it (I mean there were less than 30 of us working (front staff, higher up, and factory) so it wasnt a huge budget for it lol)
I’m really disappointed how inaccurate your forecasts have become.  I had to unsubscribe.  You’re entertaining but you seem to be more focused on hype/views than accuracy these days.
I live in sunshine state so I like weather and but love hurricanes
We'll take some snow down here in northeast Florida!
I will never forget the 2016 snow storm in Philadelphia because it was the day I found out I was pregnant with my miracle baby and the entire city was at a standstill. I will also never forget the ridiculous amount of heatwaves we had in the summer of 2016 either because I was very pregnant and we didn’t have air conditioning and I was not a very happy 🤰🏻lady in the heat! But we have an almost 7 year old daughter who hasn’t had a big snow storm since she was a toddler (and nothing like 2016) so we are long overdue for another blizzard and a chance to FINALLY use our Y’all O Meter! I am sick of seeing my sad but funny pictures of my dry Y’all O Meter during livestreams with my daughters unused snow pants 😂
I hope everyone has their snowfall indicator sticks up for this year. I have to admit, it's the best part of winter.  Thanks Ryan and Andy!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ryan, you are so funny, and I love your weather reporting!
Well, I know I'm not seeing snow in Naples, Florida. Time to get back to fishing.
...NASA approved?  GMAFB
Always watch Ryan in the winter, best damned forecaster ever.
I live 2 hrs from Nashville but how about Bardstown KY?
Sadly my people can't look at the eclipse because of tradition
I just moved to Utah from California, I’m excited for my first actual winter this year. And the fact that it might come sooner than average I’m ecstatic
Yep am a weather weenie lol 🎉
Thank you for more updates Ryan
I prefer WEATHER NINJA, Ryan!!!🌞🌦🌧🌪🌀⚡🌈
I live in Prince Edward Island, Canada.   We expect a good dump of snow every winter and we're never disappointed .  We're still talking about the winter of 2016.  The snow started in mid January and continued to fall until the end of March.  I remember seeing residual piles of snow in the Walmart car park in early June.  I hope we dont get a repeat performance this year😮
Love your videos Ryan! They are fun and informative! Thanks!!!
I live in Nashville and I’ll keep that in mind 😂🙌🏻
The Sierras are seeing their first snow this weekend.
🤷🏻‍♀️ I'm a weather weenie 🎉
Weather Weenie in North Arkansas!  ( Blytheville)
@RyanHallYall would you mind mentioning montreal, or magog in canada QC. just north of Vermont
It’s me, I’m the weather weenie
Ryan, i’m sure The Weather Channel would like to add you to their lineup of weather newscasters. . 😃😀
A lighter than normal snowpack in the Midwest and Great Plains will be bad news for the Mississippi River and New Orleans because it will worsen already low water levels on the river. Here's to hoping that we get plenty of snow upstream from them this winter.
Didn’t this guy used to make different videos??
But what does the wooly worm have to say about these predictions?
... I'm gonna have to finally buy snow tires aren't I.
Im from the future and the first snowflake fell at 10:32 pm on Jan 24th 2024, close guess tho!
Ryan, why do I gotta be a weather weenie😂😂😂😂😂
We've already had snow here in Colorado in some regions, especially higher elevations.
After this summer we had in Michigan.  Let the snow begin.  Just stay below freezing for months.  Ice ice baby.
That's probably closer then any MSM reports will ever be.
North of Nashville here and I will let you know.🧐😃
What about NC.  Be blessed
I hope va gets snow
Hey Ryan,  just wanted you to know that I love watching your channel. Great job pal!
I have always been a weather Weiner 🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂
Current temp in Ottawa,Ont. Canada is 22°C (71.6°F) which is highly unusual for the last days of Sept. Ottawa typically ranges from 8°C to 16°C on this date. Oct.4 forecast is 28°C (82.4°F)! Last winter we had less snow than normal. With the promise of a warmer than usual winter, Im expecting higher snowfall & praying we don't have another crazy ice storm like 1998. Which reminds me - time to order a new solar powered emergency radio! I'll probably find my old one the moment I buy a new one... LOL 😉
🙌WW🙌🥳😅
#HallGanG
So, you’re not going to talk about the catastrophe that’s currently happening in the NY Metro Area?
Wow New York might see snow in November
I live in Michigan. I'm gonna hold you to the late snow idea. If this turns out untrue, I will be filing a lawsuit... after I get my snowsuit...
That historic average seems off for sure for the Portland area of Oregon, as we typically only see our first snowfall in February.
I’ll take it!
As former Wyoming resident winter is a all year event up there
If you can predict Nebraska's snowfall I will be impressed! I really am hoping for snow before Christmas this year. It never happens. Please do a video on the Plains snow risk chance before Christmas!!!
Eeee! I can’t wait for snow ❄️ I am 56 and still get excited every year for snow ❤
I'm such a weather weenie I have the shirt to prove it! 😂  I know me and the kiddos are ready for the snow!
🤣😂🤣 Weather Weenie from SE Michigan whose hoping for a warm winter!!!
I live in Nashville! Just marked it down on my calendar
Winter in the U.S. can always be very difficult.
Yeah everyone get ready for the snow guys and your thermoses ready for when you got to work
Ryan, I’m in Pendleton, Indiana. Last winter I got my snowblower ready to go. Me! An almost 67 year old grandma. Lol. Never had to use it but was really happy about it. Sounds like this winter might be even better. Woooohoooo!
I work in Nashville, so Imma tell my boss on Jan 4th that I gotta run to Centennial Plaza for a minute to prove someone wrong, or be wrong  🤣🤣🤣
Alright Hall, watched the video and bought the solar glasses. Your January prediction better be within a couple days or you're just another local weatherman
I remember when it snowed in Florida January 19, 1977. Some people were panicking thinking it was the end of the world. Others were calling it "White Rain", Lol.
So Dec. 1 st to Dec. 15 Th for my state which is a switch from last year, we hardly had any snow last winter !
I might need a Saint Bernard.
As an OTR truck driver, I was saved by Ryan's coverage, more than once!!!  He is much more accurate than the meteorologist 'weather' guys (and gals).  I truly believe they just look out the window, and tell you what they see at that moment.  Ryan and his teams are absolutely STELLAR!!!  🥰🥰
You said East Coast was going to have very active snowfall and biizards this coming winter ?
Thank you for all that you do!
I am so tired of not having a “real” winter in NW Iowa, two years ago it was so bad, the ground had inch and a half wide, and over a foot deep cracks in it. I thought our house was going to fall into a sinkhole. 🙁 I am not a huge winter person, but the lack of snow and rainfall is very disconcerting.
Sure
I trust you more than local weather forecasters. I will have my super duper 30 inch electric start hand warming snow blower and large generator ready just in case. 😁
Hey, I’m not a weather weenie, I just live in Denver and want to know when I need to blow out my sprinklers.
The last solar eclipse we had when I was still working was very special. The supervisor ordered a picnic luncheon and we all sat outside awaiting the eclipse. Get all your friends/co-workers together and celebrate this phenomenon together.❤
Hold up. I know this because I have pictures. I live in Chicagoland and the winter of 2016-2017 we had a lot of snow. Especially early on. I don’t know total inches but judging by the pics we had more snow than the La Niña years
Happens every winter. Get over it.
Omg thanks 🎉❤
Nashville Weather Weenie here, and I'm super stoked about this prediction!
But maybe if ….why bother?
We rarely get snow even when predicted
We had a mild winter here in Pittsburgh very little snowfall it was nice but I suspect we get a lot this year
Thanks Ryan!
I live in the PNW and we have snow already on Mt. Hood. As a snowboarder who’s putting in the training work in the gym I can’t wait for the season to start. Fingers crossed for an early start
I have very genuinely been meaning to buy some pairs of glasses to view the upcoming eclipses, and just hadn't done it because I wasn't 100% sure where to start besides googling it at some point. So, thanks for making a task super easy for my adhd butt!! 😂
Love 'ya Ryan❣️
What I want to know is how MUCH snow I should be expecting this year, especially for Washington state.
Proud to be a weather weenie! Thanks for the snow info. 😎
Saw the last total eclipse that passed over Bristol. I still have my eclipse glasses.
I'm in Knoxville Tn so we are in the average area. So Dec. 15th? Hope we get some this year. Last year we got nothing.
Well I’ll be seeing snow next week.
What about Texas
I always want snow in GA but it's rare !!
3 hours south of Chicago  I haven't  seen snow before Christmas  in years. Usually  late January  February  is when we get hit good. I wish we got snow sooner. And more than 2" since part of my job in winter  is snow removal!
I was about to fall asleep before watching your video and your sudden jokes and transitions and making me laugh just woke me up. So thanks Ryan!
WINTER IS COMING
I remember a few Halloweens with snow. Hates trick or treating in a snow suit but I’ll take snow over rain on Halloween any day, it’s less wet
I'm from WNC, and we used to get our first snow around Halloween. Last year, we didn't get any.
Wooooohooooo!! I'm a weather weenie!!!!
Ok, Ryan, I'm just outside Nashville, so I will see
Shit, we close on a house next week, next purchase is a shovel
Yes, I am a Weather weenie ❄️ 🌧️ 💨 ⛈️
Im that doofis
I rarely see snow in Southern Maryland and you started this video off talking about two of the largest I’ve seen and that doesn’t make me feel good.
Hurricane season over?
Yes. I am a weather weenie lol. Been one since I was very little
I seldom here anything about Texas or even how the weather may be this winter 2023
Another winter in Connecticut with lots of rain instead of snow 🤬😡😤. Rain should be illegal in the NE from 12/1 to 3/31!!!   Might need to move to Canada.
I am so excited for the April 8th one, its on my birthday!!!
Dang you got me! I’m a weather weenie 😂😂❤💀
Who remembers that July snowstorm we had in Key West back in 1985?
I drove 18 wheeler Flatbed as a Yacht hauler back in the 90's ..Got snowed in for 10 days in the No Name snowstorm of 1993 in Englishtown New Jersey
So what if you’re in the white not the blue not the brown the white then once it gonna do you don’t say, what are we not gonna get any snow?
I live in the hill country, Tx this eclipse is gonna be right over us. Expecting half a million people this October and more next April. We are a small town in extreme drought. If y’all plan on coming here please be wise with water.
We were in the Smokies for the last full eclipse as well, I remember the glasses be sold for $20 too. They were only $5 here in Ohio when we left and we thought that was high!! LOL!!!!!
Got a 5 pack of the glasses. Best sponsor product ever! …and I know I’m a weather weenie. 😅
I dont remember really snowstorms or snow period in december. Only memories of it i have is like in end of jan or through feb
I saw frost warnings and -1.5C on my motorcycle trip north of Lake Superior 2 weeks ago.  It was 32C  (90F) the day before. Pretty normal for this time of year.
Bruv, I'm a german guy living in Germany and watch these vids, I'm a total weather weenie^^
I love snow and hoping we get some this winter in Colorado Springs....it seems to go around us a lot!!! We are mountain desert and need it. TY!
For years Wisconsin saw it's first snow in November, exactly as you state: however, first snow has been in January the last few years.
Will we EVER be able to wear a sweater in South Florida this winter?
I'm old enough to remember snow in mid October in Midwest and wading through it on Halloween twice.  Volcanism definitely was the reason and they've been extremely active this year. Snow pack in Siberia and Greenland other factors, most Early pack in decades this year.  Mahe Ohna ✌️ Favour ALL
What part of Tennessee did u come to in 2017? I live near chattanooga and we had totality for about a minute. I'll never forget that
Did you just call me a "Weather Weenie?"😂
I am hoping I get a good snow storm this year.  Last winter I didn't get much of anything....
NOOOO!  No snow talk.....😮lol
I knew well before this that I was a weather weenie. Thanks, Ryan!
Can I use 3D glasses to look at the eclipse? I'm joking.
I'm a Weather Weenie...
#RyanhallYall I live in Brooklyn Ny, so when and how bad is gonna be for this year. Period 💯 facts
The Olympic Mts. on the Olympic Peninsula received snow already.  😊
Im a weather Winnie 😁
This is my favorite channel  ever since I became a mailman.   I honestly never gave that much thought about the weather,    then I started walking 14-20 miles outside every day...  Now I watch weather youtubers.   What a weird trip my life took.
Heck yeah! Team El Niño!🙌🏻
I once viewed a solar eclipse with lesser tinted glasses.  I got a small circle of burn that I hoped would go away.  It mostly did, but I noticed the other morning I still saw the image.  So yes, it's very true about looking at it w/o protection.
Weather Weenie lmao
Nashvegas, Jan 3rd, 10.33pm, centennial Park. #remindme
I’m in northwest Montana, snow made its appearance this week in the mountains!
Can you please add Alaska.. pretty please.. even just a mention or two.. Thanks!!!!
Love you!
What about Alaska? 😮
Thanks for the snow info! I’d really love to know when NW Missouri is going to get some rain though 😅. We have been so dry!
😂 Louisiana here. I want snow ❄
Tells us to find our state on the map. Doesn’t show Alaska on the map. Instructions unclear.
So happy to see snow in Minnesota will likely be later than average 😂🙏🏾
Lol 7:57
I was going to take a fall colors trip, but looks like I’ll be taking a fall storm chasing trip instead, not upset about it haha ⚡️⛈️
Ha.  I knew the setup for the eclipse punchline.
I hope you’re right but I want it to come farther south to Chattanooga! We didn’t get any snow last year and I need snow!
How dare you call me a weenie
All I want to know is when Maryland will see snow. As a former Michigander, I miss my snow. I'm praying for that big, beautiful snowfall. ❄️❄️❄️
We were in NC when the solar eclipse occurred and we had welding hoods. So we got to look directly at the sun when it happened.
perdition  for the Uk for the south  this winter .. any snow here
🤞🏽 Hoping coastal Maine gets hammered with snow this year!
jAN 3 2024 ...... cAN YOU please predict it to snow ealier than this date thank you!
After your snow prediction last year, you won’t mind if I take this year’s forecast with not just a grain of salt, but a whole salt lick.
Snowed last week in Ogden Utah. My sister sent pics. I love snow but live in south so very seldom see it
Jan 3rd, huh?  Nice!
Summer saps my spirit man. 😔 Absolutely looking forward to cooler weather. Nothing better than a cup of coffee in the still, quiet mornings just before dawn in the Autumn and Winter. 😌☕
This dude is 🧢…it’s 1000 degrees in Texas and still gonna be hell for next month as well
Me: IM NOT A WEENIE Ryan: You Can’t Hide What’s Inside
When will we get the earliest forecast for the April 8th eclipse? I'm thinking about shooting for Rochester as Cleveland should be a mob scene.
Yes!!!!  I'm a Weather Weenie, and I'm in the brown. Thanks Ryan.
I am a weather weenie but when school stops working that's when I start working so just waiting for the snow to come around my mom hates all the cold weather as in snow sleet and hail all the cold stuff
So basically what your saying is that I want to live in Florida.
I ordered my glasses & smartphone filter today from VisiSolar! Thank you Ryan for the info & discount code!!!  As always, keep up the phenomenal work on bringing us the weather & all you & the crew do! ❤️
Wow more winter weather what do we do. Don't panic people we will get through this
I'll bet you northern ILLINOIS does not get more then a inch of snow until December at the earliest. First snow starting late November.  Hell last 2 years we didnt have first snow until late December early January. It would get super cold but no snow
Oh my, I'm a weather weenie!  LOL  Allways listen to your reports!   Greetings from south of Buffalo, N.Y.
Got to see the full solar eclipse in 2017 in my dad's backyard in Franklin, NC.  Funny....because most people went downtown to see it.....we stayed at my dads....and the clouds rolled in downtown but they didn't come our way until the eclipse was over.  Win Win for us....feel bad for all those folks downtown.....win some, loose some !
My niece is an archeologist. The one in 2018 was a riot. One of the groups with her drove forty minutes or so to reach a place where there would be totality and ripped off their clothes and howled at the moon. LOL
Put your prediction in my calendar. I live in the Nashville area
I saw light snow last week on a peak in the San Juan’s outside Pagosa Springs Co. and the live web cam had snow falling in Wolf Creek Pass as well as Pagosa Peak. A few hikers told me they got snowed on in Telluride, Co. 🥸
Wow just 2 weeks ago you guys were saying big snow and cold in newengland so much for accurate
For an annular eclipse, ensure that you keep your glasses on even during totality, as not enough of the sun is covered during annular totality to make the sun safe for unprotected viewing.
I looked last year and el nino doesn't seem to effect snowfall for Tulsa oklahoma. Like it being el nino doesn't mean we have a higher chance at snow in Tulsa. Which is unfortunate. I wish it was more solid for us here.
It's about 95° and humid as heck where I'm at today, so all this talk of snow is giving me hope for the upcoming weeks. So thank you❣️  I'm definitely over this summer this year.
You’re the best Ryan!  You and your whole team!
Bonafied 'weather weenie' right here. I love weather, talking about the weather.
Everyone keeps talking about hot Georgia was this summer.  I don’t know why, we’ve hardly ran our air a full day all summer.  We haven’t had it on in a week now.  The days in the summer where it was really warm in the house in the afternoon, I turned it on around 3 or 4.  Just my observation but seemed cooler than most summers this year.
I hope it's a short winter here in Western New York. I know it's a bit old fashioned to consider the patterns of the woolly bear, but the one I saw earlier today seems to match Ryan's prediction.
Ryan I was wondering, we came from South Eastern PA, 40 mins north of Philadelphia and we moved to Kentucky as my husband is active duty in the US Army so we are now in Fort Campbell. I LOVE SNOW LOVE IT!!!!!!! Does Kentucky get much snow? I know we are farther south than PA, but I know due to the warm waters we never really got measurable snow until after January, which sucks. So I was just wondering if you can give me a lil insight on winters here in KY. Thanks 🙂🙂
Great information
EVER Heard of the upcoming Ice Age ?
I’m a weather weenie lol
Ryan, I live in Nashville and I have written it all down. I will definitely let uou know.  I know I'm a Weather Weenie. My husband thinks I am his personal Weather forecaster! 😂😂😅 9:17 9:17 😅
As a Nashvillian, I certainly marked your date of January 3rd :) !
Ahh Shucks I’m a weather weenie
That Nashville snowfall prediction doe 😅 hilarious ❤
Where are all the super dooper unprecedented number of cat 5 hurricanes yall predicted because of the record breaking ocean temperatures?
i  n e e d  s n o w
Your Dallas pin was more like Tyler, just FYI
Lol... I don't live in Nashville TN but in middle Tn .. So I will be making a mental note for sure !
I wonder if us here in Austin Texas will see any snow again! Usually El nino means we might get more ice storms with overrunning warm air. Hoping that's not the case though.
Last year in northern Ohio, west of Cleveland , I never shoveled snow once.  We don’t get snow like we used too.
I remember the 2016 Winter Storm (Nemo) There was no school for almost 2 weeks because our roads were bad as is (tons of hills and bends) without a blizzard, we lost our mid-winter break due to it except for Presidents day
Thank for the solar eclipse info. I called my kids off when they were small and made a fun day out it (middle daughter wants to work for nasa) When this one come in 24 right over us in the east, 2 kids will are adults and 2 kids are teens. time has flown by.
I'm in Lassen County CA... most folks here are pretty tuned in to weather and  are expecting snow in mid to late October...
I’M A WEATHER WEENIE!!!!!!!
Hahaha 🤣😂 🤣😂 I'm a weather weenie 🤣😂🤣
In Houston Tx, counting the days for some cooler air!! 🙏🏻
OK You just made me Smile so Big with the solar eclipse and what is has to do with how much snow !!!!!! Im on the floor rolling...............
Hearing snow immediately gives me anxiety! 😂 I live in Chicagoland- we try to put thinking about winter as far out of our minds as possible 😩
We saw the solar eclipse in 2017. It was on my daughter's 16th birthday.  Went to a park. Had a party and watched the eclipse.
In Denver we get snow in September more times than we want.. not this year.
Late snow in Chicago makes my Subaru sad. Betty Tsu wants to GO PLAY! Even if it is late, I sure hope we get more than last year. We were in a bit of a drought. It might be my imagination, but it seems like we get more snow when it is a warmer than average winter. Fingers crossed! I'm looking forward to your fun winter videos. Get your Y'all-O-Meters ready!
I remember trick or treating in the snow one year as a child in Central Kansas.  That would have been around 1975-1977.
Signs in the sky
Is it going to be a cold and snowy winter in Middle Tennessee?
Since I live in Yuma AZ, I'm hoping that this el nino brings a lot of rain this winter 🤞 ❤️🌵☀️⛈️🌈☮️🐎🐕
Am I the only one who held on to my solar eclipse glasses from the last one🤔
Here in Utah we got snow like 3 weeks ago in high elevations then last week we got more.(May be off alittle on time life's weird)
I'm in Northern Virginia, we've had quite a few historic storms, had 39" I think that was about 8 years ago.  Last year we did not get any snow...strange winter.  Looking forward to snow this winter!
Yeah it’s 90 everyday so I don’t expect snow for a couple months
SNOW ARE MADE OF MOVING PLANET FAR FROM THE SUN STARTING SEPTEMBER AND MARCH ARE BACK CLOSE IN THE SUN FOR SUMMER UNTIL AUGUST,, EL NINO ARE MADE OF THE DEATH OF LAVA INSIDE THE LAND MADE OF THE LOST OF FUEL AND MINERAL OF THE PLANET
Do you got Tennessee to Kingsport?
Snow expected this weekend above 8300 ft in the Sierra Nevada mtns around the Lake Tahoe region. Definitely an early start to the season.
I live in Clarksville, so I'll be lookin for those flakes Jan 3 haha
I'm a weather winney.
Ryan you definitely have the best job ever and I’m definitely serious about that!!! I mean really who could go to a job and mess up on something several different times and not get fired??? Well that is only a weather forecaster for sure!!! You could say that Iowa is going to get around 12” to 16” of snow on December 20th and every one would be going out to stock up on last minute groceries and anything else that they might need for a couple weeks to where they may not be able to get out if they was to get that much snow but the day comes and goes and nothing not even one flake of snow at all and well you would still come in the next day to work and say well things changed luckily and it passed by and you would still have a job!!! That definitely has to be the best feeling for sure!!! Lol!! Awesome video Ryan and remember to keep up all the hard work buddy!!!!
Great job, Ryan! I am ready for winter in Texas.
My 40th birthday is the April solar eclipse!! I’m stoked❤❤
January 3rd is a solid guess. 60 some years ago that was almost a sure thing. We'd go to west Tennessee to grandma's for Christmas and come back to Nashville after new year's in the snow!
Ryan we may be weather weenies but it's your fault. We love you brother.
I'm a weather weenie and I'm proud! 🎉😂
I'm proud to be a weather weanie
What was going on back in 1992 that caused the southern blizzard???
when is Texas not going to be hotter than hell and "cool off"???
It is late already here. October is going to be a fun snow month here in the Colorado Rocky's!
Here in Philly the past few years we haven't had that much snow. This past winter no snow at all. The year before that the first measurable snow was in March. The yr before that was just as snowless. I really think Philly and the Mid-Atlantic is going to get walloped with at least two big storms.
Ryan, if you get that 10:33PM snowflake prediction totally right, everyone's gonna know you're a time traveler, be careful dude 🤣
TY for your continued helpful coverage of the weather!! I'm in Trenton, Ontario 🇨🇦 home of the Canadian Air Force's (the RCAF) largest base.   We're right across the Lake from Rochester, NY.     Keep those weather reports coming!!    We have purchased your Snow Meter, and will be installing it outside in Oct.  I've Trick or Treated many a time as a child, in a snowy evening 😂🎉.         Unfortunately, the solar eclipse glasses, don't ship outside of the USA.  😞😓   I'll be on the hunt for safe glasses for April's total solar eclipse.    I remember seeing one when I was in High school, in Montréal, Quebec 🇨🇦 in the 1990's.     Sending love from Ontario 🇨🇦
I'm holding you to the Nashville prediction, Ryan! If you win, what happens?!
We had the 1991 snow storm on Halloween in Minnesota
We saw the 2017 eclipse in Casper Wyoming. Amazing!!!
What about extreme north Georgia and extreme southwest NC
Hush Ryan We Do Not Need it In PA LOL Let Dump on your Place
Hope no one gets a bad ice storm! Much love to ya'll
I live in California we had snow in the Yosemite area last night   Forecasters out here are predicting in a repeat of last year .  Any thoughts on this ?
I will let my dad know about Jan 3. He lives just outside of Nashville. I got to attend the 17 solar eclipse with my daughter's 12th grade science class in Sweetwater. It was amazing! My son in law is already planning our trip for April. haha
“Hi! My names Linda and I’m a weather weenie”! ♥️
Umm if we are going by that we would have already had snow in Cheyenne or at the latest Sunday which will be in the 80’s and the lowest temp is supposed to be on Tuesday the 3rd which will still be 60f!
Thank you Ryan. God's blessings on us all. Maranatha ✝️🙏👑❤️
California snows in cities? Is gonnabe super rare.
On the Bortle scale I'm a 2, so super dark and on the path of the eclipse.
Nobody south of I-10 is seeing snow this year or next year. I've lived down here for 35+ years and nobody has ever been able to forecast snow on the Gulf Coast. We've only had  snow 4 times in the last three decades.
As a school teacher just south of Nashville, I hope you're right!!😂😂
Oh, you busted me.   Yes, I am a weather weenie...and proud of it!
Ryan hall IS the BEST weatherman!!!
Here in Texas it’s usually 80 degrees all the way through December then winter for 6 to 8 weeks then back to summer 😅! Thanks Ryan love your videos and updates trucking down in Texas
Just go to a place that sells welding supplies and by number 12 welding lens with mirror coating. No do not use self darkening.
Even if this winter will be active, it certainly won't be as cold as it used to be many years ago 😢
Our mountains already got snow last Tuesday above 7000 feet in southwest MT.
I live in the pink zone, in Michigan! A year ago today it was 37 degrees, today it’s 67!
The Weather Weenies should have a get together on Jan 3rd 2024 in Centennial Park at 10:33pm in Nashville, TN and see if the first snowflake actually falls.
I AM a Weather Weenie😆❤️ 😘
#weatherweeniesunite 😂😂😂
I don't remember a blizzard in 2003 but I remember something in 2005 that hit Southern Ohio like the Vulcans hammer Thing was it was mostly ice there was like maybe a quarter inch of snow on top of it but we got ice that just took power out for at least a week It was a level 2 snow emergency so technically we weren't supposed to be driving I mean my mother kind of Hadley way to drive but that was only to get to and from work since she is a medical professional That didn't include driving us to my aunt's house in courthouse so that we can have Christmas at a place with electric still running
Yaaaaaay, I'm a weather weenie!!! 👏🏼 ☁️🌡️
All the Middle TN teachers praying already for this accuracy since most return from Winter Break on the 3rd! 😂  Thanks Ryan!
Ry Hall, the UltimatenWeather Weenie! Powder Hounds unite!
Amarillo usually has at least very cold weather on Oct 31. My daughter got married in 1997 on that night and we had sleet and ice sheets (and she planned to be outside, I knew better having grown up there). So, that's a given. Snow hits around December 12 or so because we're higher up. Dalhart is usually the first to get it coming off the Rockies. I've seen snow in Friendswood Tx (near NASA Houston) about 4-5 times in 32 years of living here, including one Christmas Eve snow that had measurable all the way to Galveston. It was so sweet!   Let's hope it's a calm year after all the mayhem of this year's chase season.
Fill lake powell!!
Don't count on it.
PLEASE consider doing forecasts for the eclipse paths for both eclipses!! Especially the April 8 2024 TSE of course! Sky & Telescope's Jay Anderson says there's a much-improved chance of clear skies for all of TX on that date thanks to El Nino... but I need more reassurance before plunking down big fees for an overpriced campsite! They are going fast!
NOAA just released their prediction, showing much warmer and dryer in finger lakes area of NYS
What the hell, what about Alaska and Hawaii.....
I just want one week of below zero to kill all the ticks in the north.
Two years ago,   an hour south of Nashville we got a blizzard and lost electricity! Right in the middle of milking 4 cows... had to do it by hand while our hands were freezing and using the flashlights from our dying phones.. that was January 2nd
I'm in southeastern KY and usually we get what Nashville gets.  I want snow.  Not puny little dustings.  I'm talking honkin' big snows.  I'm a fall and winter lover and the ideal time would be Christmas Eve, all day snow.  I don't ask for much😀
🎉🎉😅
Weather weenies unite!  ❤  Thank you Ryan!
You are already wrong mid -late Oct for Western PA. First snow fall. Sorry lived here probably die here.
I'm playing eclipse utopia in utopia Texas in October and April right in the center of that x
Bold prediction Cotton. Let's see how it turns out 😉
🤣 Did anyone tell you today that you are amazing? 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
The glasses only have USA available???
615 here your date is noted
He never ever mentions Denver. 😂
I can deal with the snow…I just don’t like the sun setting earlier and earlier then we have daylight savings where clocks go back an hour in November…sooo depressing!😫
So you mean I might get a white Christmas for Maryland?
To be blunt the solar eclipse next month won't be as amazing as the 2017 one since this is just an annular eclipse. The total solar eclipses are way more incredible.
I am in Nashville currently, and just might still be in the area come January.  Best of luck on the prediction!
I had a dream about a winter event at Centennial Park last night! 😊
Just ordered 2 pair Appreciate the discount code
I do anything to snow in Macon bring five more hurricanes pls
Super weather weenie hut jr?!?
👍👍👍
“I’m gonna need everyone in Nashville to pay attention I’m gonna make a bold prediction. I predict the first measurable snow fall January 3rd, 2024” *me who’s pregnant living in Nashville who’s due on January 6th* : 👁️👄👁️
I got so excited when I found out I am a weather weenie :D but considering I know what blue shed references mean... well, I guess I should have already known...
Snow in florida: never  come back to me in never years and tell me if im right
In nashville as a weather weenie, someone remind me on January 3rd.
I predict it will rain in Kentucky within the next 12 months.
I put it in my calendar. Let’s see. Thank you for all of your updates and information. It’s a lot of work and we appreciate it.
Dec 1st is our projected first snow ❄️. Until then, fall should be crisp and warmer than usual. I read a wet heavy snow winter but will transition out end of March. That's unheard of here in Ontario.
A cat grooms itself about an hour each day. Now what does that have to do with snow?  Nothing! LOL
Hey Ryan! Yes, I'm a weather weiny! Lol. Thank you!
I got to see a partial solar eclipse in nyc. I was standing on top of our office building and used my phone to observe the cool sights. It was magical! Also weather spooky.
*LOL* you're🤣🤣 the Dufus that purchased them, Ryan! now your smart to have them for all of us. hehehehe😂😂
What if you're wrong?
As a November 16 first snow Ohioan, I'm glad the hotness will go away
I'm a Weather Weenie! Lol 😂
Let’s see normal shoveling snow hits my area in northern Ohio around January 15 . And to be honest I haven’t used my snowblower in 3 years now . I’m about 5 miles inland from the lake
Glad to be a Weather Weenie™️
Nope
I would love to see some in Atlanta metro.
Anyone else use furry caterpillars as a forecast agent? Northern Colorado Front Range furry caterpillars are predicting a warmer winter than usual here. Very little fur on these babies!
I am a weather weenie 🤦🏼‍♀️🙋🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️
If it’s 10:34pm on the 3rd of Jan 2024 you owe me 10k
Lucky me ! We are in the exact middle of the annular and full eclipse.  Yay !
Don’t play Ryan I live in Chicago and it snowed years ago on Halloween!!! I was a teenager and freezing 🥶
I'm a welder. Got this thing covered.
Thanks for the solar eclipse heads up.  Northern KY is in the path.  Hoping it's not still snowing. Ha.  When do y'all-o-meters go on sale?
January 2016 near Butler, PA my son and I were headed to Ohio to see my husband who was working in the oilfields. Well, we decided to stop and get a hotel until the roads were cleared because it was nerve wrecking.😅 I’m a PA native and had not seen that much snow since maybe 07. Usually it’s just blistering cold and some light flakes.
I am not a weenie 😆
Hooray! Looks like a White Christmas possible in Arkansas. ❤
Haven’t seen any snow in Raleigh in two years, maybe a day of some ice, yes . Overall no snow at all .
Don't call him doofies he saved ur eyes so u can see it..😂😅
Is eastern Kentucky going to be dry or wet this fall and winter?
Ok ok I admit I'm a weather weenie! There's no shame with that game lol
We did the old wives tale persimmon seed test here in KY and it had thr knife. Bitter cold winds according to that! Fun to see what happens!!
Can we please have a "Weather Weenie" tshirt?
April 2024 is the next eclipsed that's puts an X on anerica
Warmer in Pa?
I live in Phoenix, AZ and would just like to see some rain, it hasn't rained here in over 4 months.
No thanks I pass looking at the eclipse I will be in prayers for protection during the whole eclipse
A warmer winter with less snow in the north east. I'm in NYC area and that would mean negative snow fall.
Official Weather Weenie in Nashville, TN here, got the date marked on the calendar, and I'm smiling from ear to ear-what fun!
I remember having snow ball fights on Superstition Mountains down in Southern AZ. I can't believe we were able to be there on the mountain that day. I'm from the upper Midwest but my local friends weren't used to seeing snow that far South. It was one of those days when I actually felt alive, before parenting, and the next two decades of economic distress would soak into the American economy. Good grief life has been unbelievably difficult.
Near Tallahassee FL lol nope
I love this channel so much. I may get merch soon to support it
Proud weather wennie
Looking forward to January 3rd here in Nashville!!!
Nice map 👌
Heard something about a super el niño this year
I live in Delaware..what  is the winter gonna b like in Newark Delaware 19713
Ryan is actually funny. I believe in this bold statement, who else does? lol
I was planning to go to new york after christmas for like a week, i dont want it to be a whole blizzard storm when i go
Love you all. I moved back to MI 2019 from FL, found your channel and don't miss a week. I have re-acclimated to my homestate weather.  It is 73 today and for me this  feels like Summer weather! Katy😂❤😊😮
*If your prediction happens you have dinner on me at any NASHVILLE eatery!  SAVE THE PORT!!!!!!*
It’s been kind of snowing in north east Ohio around 2-3 days before Halloween,  Last 2 yrs, just enough for you to take notice
Late snow in Wisconsin screws resort owners for losing winter sports enthusiasts including the birkebeiner cross country ski race and those making a living with a snowplow attached to the front of their pickup trucks. Just saying.   No snow makes a lot of red ink issues up here. 🤷😬
We are learning about El Niño in science right now and from watching you I know a lot more than most kids in my class
shove that S word where the sun dont shine!!!!!! we just started fall man 🤣
I used to live in Nashville! I still have friends that live there and I monitor their weather for them as the weather nerd of our friend group :D
One of my wife's friends already has our guestroom for the April 2024 solar eclipse...lol.
I'm in west Georgia, I20 route, and expect snow between January and as late as April. 🥶😕🥵
My husband and I got married during the total solar eclipse in 2017 ❤🌞🌛
Sir Hall hath dubbed me a “Weather Weenie”! I’ll wear that hat!
We already went through central Alberta with no snow in September so we're already behind in the measurable snow for the winter season. 6 out of 10 September's have some snow in this part of the world
Hey Ryan, who was the real doofus that day?
I understand this is measurable snow but in I'm northern IL and we normally get our first snowfall in October but it doesn't stick and it's usually followed by a warmup with rain.
Why didnt you predict the flooding in New York?  You seem to know everything about winter but cant tell New Yorkers about the dangerous rains?
Thanks Ryan  As usual an awesome forecast. As for snow here in Louisiana it’s beauty brings misery. We just not equipped to handle. Last snow we had Interstate 10 closed from Baton Rouge to Mississippi. OH My!😱
Yeah...I'm a "weather weenie" LOL!!!! I actually found you during Hurricane Ian and subscribed right then. So I watch you a whole lot. Bbbbuttt don't give us up here in Buffalo Bills/S.U. country a pass here..these Great Lakes can slam us big time unexpectedly and then 3-4 days later, it's 20+ degrees warmer...so since I've been born/raised here in this 'lake effect zone', I'll take your potential forecasts with a  lil' grain of grapple....LOL....see what I did there?!!! Anyhoo...love your channel and I'm not ashamed to say " I too AM A WEATHER WEENIE"...
dont  believe it  for a minute you are wrong more than you have right lately
I've seen a few other weather people on here but Ryan is the only one i trust. He's been the closest with accuracy then all of the rest combined. Thanks Ryan for all you and your team do. I never thought I'd say it but we finally have a weather forecaster that's accurate kudos my friend 👍🍺🍺
Last year on December or January    i barely got ant snow
I'm so ashamed.  You called me out.  I tried so hard to hide my weather weenieness but nooooo.. you turned on the floodlight and exposed me for what I am. No longer can I hide it. There is no fighting it.   Ryan Hall did this y'all !!
I lived in Nashville during the "Great American Solar Eclipse." It was pretty cool!
Probably in the winter...
i drove from miami to greenville S.C. to see the solar eclipse one of the most beautiful and amazing experiences ever i loved how cold it got in the shade as the moons shadow passed over us.
Weather Weenie here. Thanks for telling me. I did not realize.
Here in northern Virginia our big storm years are not necessarily El Nino winters but winters with a negative NAO. That's what I watch for.  93 was more of an ice storm for us with several inches of ice with the snow. 96 was a monster with waist deep snow in the DC area. 99 was bad as well and 2002 we had a lot of frequent snowstorms.
Yay !! I'm a weather wienny. lol
It hasn’t snowed in the Baltimore/DC area for about five years. But ok
Proud weather weenie here, thank you Ryan!
Climate change and propaganda have destroyed weather forecasting, that's why weatherman are constantly wrong.
Just wondering when you do think we will see snow here in Florida. Down by Tampa.
Ok. I’m confused. I thought Arkansas was supposed to get snow, sleet, ice this winter. I’m disappointed.🙁
OK so winter snow storms are also caused by global climate change.  Get rid of fossil fuels and animal agriculture, and sign up more cities as C40 Cities.
I cracked up by the way you said “doofus” lol
what about Austin Texas haha
Colorado oct 2? it's still in the 80's here lol. The mountains did get some last week though
Can confirm, MT has already seen its first snow. As an aside, I got one of those photo reminders today from a picture I took of the snow we got on this day in 2019.
Sounds pretty accurate for this year.  West MI usually has flurries at some point at the end of October...or by mid-Nov at latest.  El Nino + lake-effect means the old 1972 Jacobsen is going to get a driveway workout!!!  Woohoo!
Going to be good camping weather in central Ohio. Bring on the snow.
I saw snow hitting south west going all across south & then up east coast.  All having snow
C’MON SNOW!!! Really excited for the El Niño outlook, I desperately want snow in SE Virginia!!! 🤞🏽
I'm in Bklyn and we've been FLOODED, I don't even know if my train is running as so many have been shut and other's hav limited service, and the streets downtown Bklyn were like rivers! 😫😣😕🌧️☔
What does it mean if I'm on the edge of the brown? I can tell if I'm in it or not lmao
I just hope here in Hampshire Co. WV, that we get more than the 2-3 inches we got last winter. And we average about 25 inches.
I am proud to say that I am a Weather Weenie! I am just saying!
I live in Florida why am I watching this
If we get any measurable snow here in Kansas at all, I will be surprised. It's a brisk 96 degrees here in Kansas today. Happy Fall y'all. 😂
Bro you got me I’m a weather weenie
No because just imagine he gets this right
miami saw snow in 1977 lol  hoping we get something like that again in my lifetime.
Southeastern PA here…..practically zero snow last year. I didn’t shovel or blow once!
I work outdoors landscape when will we see first freeze temps Thank You
I enjoy your channel. You're a trip even though your not a yank!😉
I'm in Bristol TN area what's your prediction for here lol
I live in Colorado in a weather anomaly. Rarely snows here and is usually very dry even in the winter and maybe especially in the winter. It'll be interesting to see what happens.
I'm in middle Tennessee so I will be watching for your prediction!
I've had a strong feeling it's gonna be a rough snow winter for KY. 😅
Yay! I'm  a weather weenie!!!😂 🎉😂🎉😂🎉😂🎉😂🎉😂🎉
Hope you are right west tx hasn't seen snow in 2 years
Drove 6 hours to Tennessee to see the eclipse, excited the next one will be in my backyard. Ordered my glasses. Thanks for the discount link.
You verified what I have been saying to people. I have been telling people we are going to have a bad winter. How do I know? The yellow jackets are building their nests up high instead of in the ground. Which usually means bad winter? Something my grandmother taught me and I have yet to see it wrong yet.
Florida Man: What is this snow you speak of? Ooga Booga
Seems like I'm going to havr to  get some snow tire  for my rc car before Halloween because im in Massachusetts
IM A WEATHER WEENIE AND IM PROUD
I am a weather weenie.  😂😂
With La nina we have been COLD the past few winters in western NC, not warm. When we had a warm winter in 97 it was a El nino year. Actually, we had alot of mild winters in the 90's. I miss it. After the 93 superstorm, i haven't liked snow since. Hopefully it will stay away and, take the cold with it.
We don't generally see snow in Houston, but it got freeze-your-tailfeathers-off cold last year!
I hear a lot of bad winter and lot of snow stories from locals in NE Ohio. So far I’ve lived here for one winter and it’s been disappointing. Can only hope but we’ve been seeing a lot of warm air recently.
Are you going to talk about the floods in the east coast?
I am a Weather Weenie!!! Hooray!
It’s going to be cold and snowy when winter gets here. That’s crazy talk, I know, but that’s my forecast. It’s time to unsubscribe from this channel.
Hope we don’t have another of those horrible 1/2” snowstorms here in Charlotte.  Traffic was so tied up.
Pinal county AZ.  Giving you an idea of how wet and cold it was last winter, I got snow twice in February.  I live out in the desert.  Never seen snow twice in February.
Have you been watching NY & NJ the last 24 hours? Highest recorded rainfall.
My home town is Nashville and we always have late winters/snowfalls. Even though I now live about an hour east of Nashvegas, I have family that live there and I will have them head out to Centennial Park at 10:33 PM!! :)
Weather Weenie - love it 😅
Haven't seen snow in 43 years LOL
ODDLY HERE IN MONTREAL, WE USED TO GET TONS OF THE STUFF BUT IN THE LAST 5 YEARS IF WE GET MORE THAN 3 GOOD FALLS, IT'S A LOT, LAST YEAR EVEN IN MID-DECEMBER NO SNOW??
Ugh Mississippi here I envy the people who get snow 🥺
Another boring winter..... Goddamnit. Time to go north methinks.
Yeah it took me 3 hours to get home from work during that blizzard 2003
Ryan, I'm at 55.75°N, historically, (Hudson Bay Company area), we have had ~5.5 feet of snow every winter, the last 4 winters ~8+ feet of snow, with El Nino, I'm thinking, 10-1.5 feet of snow, this year. The last El Nino, gave us a storm that shut the city down for two days. First time ever. We shall see. Best wishes from the North.
The ski resorts in Oregon have already started getting snow
I want Central NYS so >>> HOT I do not see snow until January !!
thanks for the upload. You're doing amazing things and keeping it interesting. Im proud to be a weather weenie. Happy Friday have a good one y'all:)
I just want one GOOD snow. Triad NC (I leave on the 11th to meet my sister in CA so I can see the eclipse and then visit for the first time in 4 years. Give us clear skies/sky.)
So....who's the doofus again ? 😅 The guy buying or the guy sellin ?
It's so hard to give this team grief ,when their kinda constantly right.
Love to you and your family!
Thanks buddy   I'm definitely a weather weenie lol. Thafor all you do
Well I can say I am 56 and you are the first person to call me a weenie...LOL. I hope your right... I hate snow!!!
Hey, what does El Nino mean for Hawaii, specifically at the end of oct/beginning of Nov? Will there be more rain than normal? Or will the water be more warm than normal? Yiu never really talk about Hawaii, and I wanna prepare. Thanks!! You are the only weather guy I'll believe
I want my area of Southeastern Iowa to get the type of snowfall that Buffalo, NY got last winter. I want to experiance that kind of snow just one time.
Why is this consistently wrong guy always popping into my feed?  Is there a reverse-subscribe?  Because "Do not recommend channel again" seems to not bother my algorithm with this one.
Poor little Kansas
Lies
If you end up being right ryan about Nashville than you have to be physic 😂
Hey Ryan, I found you during Hurricane Idalia. I'm in Kansas, and i have family in Florida.  Just by pure luck today, I found you again. Except today I  subscribed!! I really enjoy your content!
Thanks so much for the solar glasses recommendation! Last solar eclipse we got ripped off on Amazon and they sent an email a week before eclipse that they were fake and not to use them. I was so mad, but it was too cloudy to see it anyway. LOL I just ordered the VisiSolar ones. We'll be ready this time...weather permitting! ;)
like #400
The VERY hot Atlantic Ocean is going to through a monkey wrench in a lot of these forecasts. We are gonna be sandwiched between two very warm oceans.
Thank you Ryan, Andy and Team! Great fun video. -Missouri
shooooot i feel like we havent gotten any snow until christmas in the midwest area
is there any merit to this guy?
The same thing happened in92-93!
Oh and for April 8, 2024 eclipse? Yeah good luck finding accommodations and even glasses! We will be in Southern Missouri for two nights and we got the last accomodations available and still at good rates!
Bravest, most daring weather weenie on the Tube!👍✅
The same thing happened in92-93!
Super Weather Weenie Hut Jr's
California's going to see snowfall tonight.
I need to remember to get a Y'all-O-Meter this year for snow here in Connecticut!
My area is almost always on the edge of one of his regions on the map.
But what about the "big daddy" snowstorm you talked about a few months ago?  I'm in St. Louis. We typically don't see much snow but there are those times when we will get enough to shut down the city...and that's usually 6-8 inches or more for things to be at a stand still around here.  Last year, all we got was 6 inches for the whole season!
you should also do a video on winter tornadoes in the south just to remind folks so a 12 11 21 doesn't repeat itself as in folks being caught off guard
I'm in NW Oklahoma, and it is 94 out today. I still have my pool up.
Bring on the snow to northern NM and southwest Colorado !!!
Will it get below 85F with heat index in South Florida?  I'm dying down here
The solar eclipse is perfectly coinciding with the Albuquerque International Hot Air Balloon Fiesta this year. 😉
-in a SpongeBob voice- weenie?!?!? Yes.  I’m so excited for cool weather!!!!😊
I'm so very saddened by this forecast. After last years total disappointment of a winter, I was hoping for some real snowfall on the east coast.
I live in Southern middle Tennessee and I think we will see snow by December, but I will wait to see if you are right. All the signs nature is putting out is saying it's gonna be a rough one.
I already got a hotel book in northwest NM and where I plan to view the eclipse. Super excited for it!
That’s ok. I already knew I was a weather weenie
It’s confirmed, weather Weenie here
Im giving you this one out this one time: flurries or sticking? Nashville isnt too far north for a morning drizzle to be a brief flurry in late november through mid december before sunrise.  Our first snow usually comes after the late December false spring.
I'm watching this to see if Alabama gets ANYTHING at all, cause my mom is ready to kill someone for some snow here.
So proud to be a weather weenie!  Good job as always, Ryan.
In southern Indiana we've had pretty cold winters for the past 3 years and maybe like 4 inches of snow plus ice I just really want a good snow and cold here in southern Indiana because I'm tired of the little 2 inches of snow and then like 3 inches of ice on the road I really want a snowy winter this year
I live in Alaska and have already seen snow…September 21st…temps are already in the teens in the mornings outside of Gulkana
Hi Ryan! I absolutely love your channel! Did you live in Michigan in the 90s? You look so familiar!
🥳🥳🥂🥂
If you sat on your hands would your mouth still work , just asking ?
You guys say this crap every year and every year your wrong
This is BS. I want snow!! Lots of it!
2017's Maximum was in Hopkinsville, KY. I was stationed at Fort Campbell and I missed it because I deployed one week before it happened...
The last Eclipse was amazing and for me, it felt life changing.
After all the snow the twin cities got last year in MN I’m not too upset to hear it will take longer to see snow this year 🤣 we had enough last year to make up for it
Just promise me some actual snow this year and the bunny doesn't get hurt (South Jersey). We didn't get anything the past few years and I wasn't happy.
When you speak I listen.
Will east Tennessee state any snow this winter and see like blizzard of, 93
As someone from Nashville, I will see you on January 3rd in the comments, sir. 👍
I thought I was just a storm chaser, and now I find out I'm a weather weenie 😮
Funny how you don’t mention nyc at all. Here it can snow 1 hour later from New York City but not in nyc
Yeah. I am definitely a weather weenie lol. Been fascinated with meteorology for some time.
What do you consider measurable?
I am in Memphis TN area. I am already preparing for power outages and freezing. The last 2 years have been brutal around mid January through February. It  looks like I am expecting an apocalypse. 🤣🤣🤣. After the last 2-3 years I am not going to get caught unprepared again. When I was teaching in 2016 my class had the glasses. We were able to go outside and view the eclipse. AWESOME!!! We also had the internet pulled up on the large screen to see it coming. Thank you for keeping us informed.
Old Farmers Almanac says that Tennessee is gonna be cold and snowy, 😲   Don't forget about the total solar eclipse in April 8, 2024....😎
Already have our Air B&B booked  in New England for the 2024 total eclipse. Super excited!
Real snow or chemical ice nucleation  ?
Well Ryan,  The first woolly worm I saw was entirely brown......so here in Southern TN "Winter is cancelled" 😂
West Central Wisconsin got our first snowfall October 15, 2022!!  Way too early.
Although I'm in Canada am way south West so I just need to look for Michigan and then look to the right! But I also watch because I have relatives in Texas and Oklahoma and I like to keep an eye on them. Thanks Ryan!
We all are Weather Weenies!!!!😂🤣🤣 Thanks Ryan...♥️🌹
Getting ready for my first winter in Minnesota. Glad to be in the brown😂
I would like to order up a few feet of snow in north Georgia.
That location pin is closer to Paris than Dallas.
Ryan, I see a busy winter season for us. I don't have any degree or tons of weather data. But warm oceans with El Nino here and low pressures coming from south and pulling moisture counterclockwise. I see some good southern snowstorms inside the bible belt here in the south. Great Video Ryan!!! Sorry, I am not on here more often as you know life just pulls us off to the side.
I live in Nashville, and I'm very excited for some snow!!! Not just a dusting but inches of snow!!! ☃️❄️ Let's see if your prediction is right!
I Agree with you Ryan, even I predicted all of this. Thanks again for helping those in these areas get updated on this awaited winter ahead.
Thank you for a update
Me in Florida ...
It's also crazy what solar eclipses do to shadows
Shalom from the Ohio Valley 🙏 We had only 1 rainstorm storm all summer! I love El Nino
This dude might not be the most accurate weather man in the history of weather men (although I think he probably is) but he is definitely more entertaining than any of those guys.
WHAT !??!?...........Yeah...... I am a weather weenie
My mom always went with Dick Goddard. The wolly worms are blond this year. Usually  it's going to be a bad winter if  they are dark brown
Thanks Ryan. You’re are the best in the world!
I moved from Ct. to Bennington, Vt. on Oct 3, 1987. We got 18" of snow on the 4th. All the leaves were still on the trees and we lost a lot of trees. Power was out for days. It was crazy!
Consider it ( prediction)secured in a washed out mayonnaise jar , and placed under Funk and Wagnel's back porch , guarded by a blind cur dog . 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Well shit now I have to go home after New Years and sit in centennial park and wait for snowfall.
For the love of god as long as its under 80
Question can you receive data for a davis instrument prov v2 weatherstation via weatherlink???  Have one now up and running
Hey Good Day Ryan!!! Here in Sharps Chapel Tn. from june in 50s in the AM & 70s into July 60s in AM ,high 70s to low 80s. Some warmer days. August got little warm. 70s in AM high 80s with couple 90s. September hot & dry. High 70sAM. High 80s to high 90. Even 2 days hit 100. Back down into the 50s in Am now. High 70 to mid 80s. Unusually cooler this year than in the last five years.
We're in E. Tn ( Smoky Mt's)  area. Would LOVE to see some measurable snow below 2300 ft 😂🤣😂🤣 foothills type ❤️
The 2nd eclipse is 2 days after my birthday and it travels RIGHT OVER ME!!!!  My kiddos are old enough to enjoy it too. Glasses ordered, thank you!
Nicely done Ryan!  👍👍 We have fam in Thompson Station TN, Nashville suburb, and we’re 4 hours west of there in “the top of Mississippi”.  We’ll be watching Jan 3!!
A weather wang!
I’m in Nashville & I’m saving that date Ryan!! 😂
I still have my eclipse glasses from the last solar eclipse
Bc i work in news, i had the privilege of seeing the solar eclipse at the highest point of the smokies at Clingmans Dome. Truly one of the most magical moments of my life & it's difficult to even say why. Hearing crickets chirp in the middle of the day, to feeling the temps drop suddenly.. it felt like we small beings got a glimpse into the solar system and it was spectacular.
Ryan, why do you think it is you missed the massive rain and flooding in NYC? In your last video you did discuss a system that might roll up the east coast but you said that you didn't expect it to do anything?
Im in Cookeville, tn in between Nashville and Knoxville. So what does that mean for me lol.
I saw the 2017 eclipse in Evansville In. It was eerie ! The wind stopped - streetlights came on and the temp dropped from 92° to 80 ° ! It was worth the 700 mile round trip ! Heat and all
as a mainer..jan is when it starts to hit the fan snow wise in my experience..you know how they vault over concrete barriers in games..you you end up doing that with snow banks in  bangor
Sorry Ryan We Really Don't Want it in Nashville Tennessee. People here CANT DRIVE on a CLEAR DAY
It's already snowing in Washington. For about two weeks already.
Live in east Tennessee  and went to Nashville to see the 2016 eclipse. It was creepy and amazing at the same time. If you are lucky enough to go watch definitely go.
5:10 If those were Ryan Hall branded I'd totally buy a pair lol.
Be cool if Richmond Virginia get 10 in of snow be nice haven't had a good snow in years
Thanks 😊
How long before you learn that predicting only makes you look worse at your job.?
Live in Ohio and while we've had "snow" pretty early as far as first snow, it seems like our "snowy" time is really now into late Jan into Feb.. Just seems like winter has shifted a month or so "to the right" on the calendar.. Probably just my imagination of course lol
I don't want any, but thanks anyway! In fact, with all of the evil price gouging lunatics out there, everything weather related can just stay nice & calm until the evil gouging gets gets stopped!
Let's never forget Mike Morales... RIP
It's not unusual to get a light dusting of  snow north of Little Rock Arkansas in October.
I'm confused. I thought you said in a video during the summer that the north west was going to be warmer than usual but now we're expecting snow sooner than expected?
Odessa tx
All of you in TN just make sure that you don't see Ryan out there at Centennial Park with a snow making machine to prove he was right!  ❄❄❄
W Pittsburgh Mention. 1:50
You're the Man, Ryan!
Proud to be a Weather Weenie!
As early as possible for me!  I am SICK of summer!  I am in Arkansas so hopefully we will see a white Christmas this year!  :)
Nope
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas. Loved seeing this update
👁👁   9:13
So what your sayin is go buy a almanac and wonder if their seasonal predictions are correct😮
Did you figure in for climate change,   carbon emissions,  rising oceans?  Number of cars on the road?
So I'm old, fat, and now I'm a weather weenie too?🤣🤣
I want more snow.
Nashvillian here. Let’s see about this prediction. There’s a saying here if you don’t like the weather just wait five minutes.
I love your channel! Thank you for this. I’m someone who absolutely loves the snow ⛄️ I live in Pioche Nevada, which is basically Utah, and last winter we had our first snow late October. Well see how it goes this year! 🌨️ 💜🌨️
Great episode Ryan, your so good at predicting the weather. Thanks so very much.  You prediction of snow for Nashville TN is so cool, and right down to the time and place, good luck Ryan.  We Love you. 😅
My grandma always said dark colored deer mean mild winter, the deer get lighter in color when you get a big snow winters in order to blend in. I wouldn’t hang my hat on this, BUT, this is the first year in my 5 decades that deer are very visibly dark. Not only deer the squirrels are exceptionally dark. Who knows but the wildlife has very different colors the normal . So I’ve made my prediction, mild winter.
The Mnts above us here Tiffany Mnt already have gotten snow and it was 34F here. Conconully, WA. Today is nice, cool Fall like and sunny.
It has already snowed on Mt Shasta in northern California.
Ryan, I'd love to subscribe and watch more, but I find them to be too long.  Just being honest.  I suggest more, but shorter ones.
im excited for dec 30th i want snow
Actually it starts snowing alot of the time in September in Yellowstone, timberline Lodge in Oregon 6k elevation etc
Who's the duffus? You paid $20.00 for those 5 cent glasses.
Thank you   ( Iowa ) ❤
so im a weather winnie
I'm a weather weenie from the UK, watching American weather. I'm happy with that. To all those looking forward to the snow, I hope you get what you are hoping for :) please send some my way when your done lmao.
CO already had snow in early Sept. :)
I live here in Whittier and Western North Carolina how cold and snowy is going to get our area.
I was raised in Tennessee and I think your prediction just might be dead on. I currently live in Utah and there is already noticeable snow on the peaks
Where I am in Northern NY and where I am we see snow in mid to late October and we always get measurable snows in November
My least favorite video of the year 😫
Okay I’ll sum it up … it’s going to snow this year if you normally get some when … at some point bottom line
I hope we get snow this year! ❤
Light blue in Texas will have it's first snow the week of thanksgiving.  It will be a winter mix.
your nashville marker looked closer to memphis
We already have snow here in Central Oregon Cascades. Super early snow fall!
Loved the Segway for the eclipse glasses.
I believe it will snow somewhere in October in oregon, I am in Oregon and I’m 100% committed to this realization.
We don't need any snow in NC ! Snow Sucks !
The Dallas location made me chuckle a bit.
Indiana has a rainy season. Nothing like the snowy 70s. Havent had a good snow covered winter since the late 80s. Sucks!
You are the best!
You're wrong about being a weather weenie, I plow snow in western KY and really like non snow days. I will convert back to liking snow days when I retire and not until. There are to many people out on the roads whom don't know how to drive in bad weather conditions.
I've been saying this since Spring. This winter is going to be brutal. And it's starting to look like I'm going to be right.
Snowing in the mountains of Washington state
Had most of the eastern "storms wrong last year.Two inches is not a storm.
Got my eclipse glasses, thanks Ryan!
💨Please be more accurate about western north Carolina  mountains...💨
do you think frost dates could be pushed back as well?
I hate snow and cold and im in Charlotte nc
The last 3 years in the White Mountains of Arizona we got the first snow between mid to end of October. Woke up October 27, 2020 with 13" of white stuff on the ground 😢
I hope ga gets snow again
Glow bull wh or ming.
Love your insights. I’m a Weather Weenie!!!!
I love the prediction for Nashville hahahaha
I freaking love this channel
Does anyone know if a channel like this exists for Canada or for Ontario/Quebec?
I really want a White Christmas in Michigan.  So here's hoping.  Thanks Ryan!
You are awesome 🎉
I'm a proud Weather Weenie xD
Thanks ❤Ryan love watching you always a good time
Haha I live right in the middle of that very small white sliver  so we’ll see..
Eh...maybe.
I'm 5 hours east of Nashville but I'll hold you to it I guess
We had a partial solar eclipse in our area. The coolest part was how the shape of the sun reflected in the shadows. It was like looking at a real life photoshop brush. Absolutely fascinating.   We were provided some of those sponsors glasses by our town coffee shop. Pain to use with glasses, but i'm interested in that phone filter...
I am in zone 5B (gardening) and our usual first frost is around September 21th....this year, we still hadn't seen frost and 14 days forecast look warmer than usual
So the same spot in Texas will get a solar eclipse? Need to contact my astrologer. Something will happen. I promise
Just watched this on YouTube for the first time today. In my opinion, I think that as a meteorologist you're definitely the best & the most reliable. Both you, Andy Hill and Brian Shields of the Mr. Weatherman channel on YouTube. If I were to watch The Weather Channel again as opposed to occasionally, I would definitely see either you or Brian Shields  on the Weather Channel, but not Andy Hill, no hard feelings, along with other meteorologists on the Weather Channel like in the years past, like Rebecca Stevenson, Chris Warren and Jim Cantorie, just to name a few. That would be interesting to see, but then again, that's just me, just my imagination. Again, thank you & both Andy Hill and Brian Shields for all that you do and keeping us safe & updated on the weather (Don't be scared, be prepared) here in the US and up here in Washington state, thank you and God bless 🙂👍🙏💒🌎📺⛅️⛈️🌦🌧🌨☃️❄️⛱️☔️🌀🌬🌫🌪🌩.
😂 Weather Weenie
We get an ice storm in West TN every 20 years. It varies in intensity but happens around mid-late January. Our last one was in 2004.
Spring Valley New York Rockland County
We were about 100 yards from the NASA/JPL folks in Kentucky for the eclipse, it was awesome.
Just tell me there’s gunna be a ton of snow in the Rockies again this year. I’m ready for another epic snowboarding season.
Ryan ! yoo 🤘 , best forecaster out there ,and without know it all elitism , you make it fun , and thats what its all about
minnestoa Minneapolis
Had 34° F here in Lowville, NY last week already with a slight frost! Great video, I’ve been looking forward to this video all week! Keep up the good work!!!
Proud to be a Weather Weenie!😊
Yah, I am a weather weenie!  lol
I'm a new grower in Indiana, so first frost dates would be REALLY helpful. 😊
So it seems like you suggested we might have a milder winter in Maine with the potential of a few heavy blizzards?
birthday is Nov 17th, hoping I wake up to a snow!
I live in Nashville, you're on buddy.
Montana has already gotten snow
I was passing this link to my kids and sister so I thought why not list it here, 5 pair nasa approved for 12.99 pretty decent
The solar eclipse "glasses" are also sold at Home Depot
LOL - I am just outside Nashville, will have to keep it in mind!
New Jersey has been shafted by snow the last 3 years, please give us alot!
This was a fun outlook to live with!
ryan idk if u actually look at these comments but ,i would like to say normally on averge every el nino winter ,most of the south east experiences snow like the blizzard of 1993 was an el nino and the armagedon of 2014 was a el nino just saying the south could have a chance this year especially if u throw in the extra heat from the golf could act as fuel for snow storms in the long run
We haven’t had snow in SE Georgia since January 2018. We got 6 inches. I’m crossing fingers to see it again. It was so cool.
How about Texas? especially Austin?
I am 13 years old, and I love weather. sadly, this year I don't think I will have much snow because of the strong El-Nino. I live right under Lake Michigan and live in Indiania. Thank you for being my weather man for the past 4 years!
2003 ish. We lived in central Eastern Colorado. My daughter was 4/5. That Halloween we had a wicked blizzard  that shut the interstate. She had to wear he costume, Dora, over her bright pink ski suit (overalls, heavy down matching coat, matching snow boots, taboggon and ear muffles)  just to go to the 15 houses in town that had lights on. And it was still so very windy and cold.  The next weekend the town had everyone bring their candy and all the kids to do a Halloween redo in the town hall. But it was a mess for a week.
I now need a Weather Weenie sweatshirt.  😂
I say it will be around Dec 10-12 in the Northeast
The farmer's almanac said average rainfall is a flood +a drought ÷2. Snow isn't any different.
East TX here and it could be Jan-Feb or 2026
I remember 2016, I've got a foot of snow, or a little over for the first time since i was in grade school in the late 90s
I remember the North Carolina snow storm of 2000
Yeah 🥳 I’m a weather weenie 🙌🏻🤩🤪 thanks Ryan 🌻
We’ll be lucky to see snow in Ohio this year. It’s soooo different here from when I was growing up. Trick or Treating in snow. Big snows in November. 😢it’s sad…..  We don’t get a real fall anymore either. I hate it.
I'm just ready for the cool crisp fall.  Snow can wait.
Your snow forecast map looks like a typical La Nina pattern instead of El Nino. Isn't it normally warmer and drier in the west and cooler and wetter in the east during El Nino. This is completely backward
New York is flooding right now , it ‘s pour a lot of heavy rains since last night.
Proud to be part of the Weather Weenie Club!! 🥳😂
Weather hot dogs on top 😂
😂😂😂 Weather Weenie
Hoping Northern Virginia gets hammered this winter ❄️❄️❄️
Hope y'all have at least 72 hours worth of food and water.
huh -- NASA  "Not A Space Agency"  huh
I've lived in maryland my while life. Thoes storms were rough
do you cover places outside of the US like Nova Scotia? because there is no channel that does I can see and it will grow your channel if you did
Our biggest snow was March 1980 east NC.
Although we got almost no snowpack last winter in MA, I think we made up for it w/heavy rainfall here in the NE (flooding everywhere). As a result, I'm totally okay w/a mild winter here and a later snowfall so I can keep surfing in warmer water through Dec.❄️  *April 8, 2024 - Total Solar Eclipse.🕶️ Got it!
Florida here. Hurray no snow! Once again!
Weather weenie😂😂😂😂 I laughed out loud
Yo thanks for the discount Ryan got me some Solar Shades the 12 dollar bundle for $10.20 and free shipping! 👍 Im in Dallas do you know if ill beable to see the October one if not then April?
This is really helpful as a professional driver that crosses all 48 states
Thanks for this info and the discount code. Just ordered my viewing glasses and phone lens.
Southern Ontario (Toronto) we usually get the first few flakes November 15.
W vid yessir 3:09 i wonder if a retired atlantic named hurricane can pass from the pacific into the atlantic again, and effect the same spot 🤯
😫I just want to know when South Texas will be 60° for a day.
Great Video
Ryan isn't a weather weenie. He is a weather wizard.
Yay! I’m a weather weenie!
The last minute was golden haha
Watch how all animals react during solar eclipse,  most go to sleep, especially ducks & chickens.
Its 96 in Dallas.  You are teasing us.  When will the snow get here?
Let's Go murfreesboro resident here and would be happy to see a good snow this winter even tho and 1 inch of snow will shut the city down haha😂
Thanks for the heads up Ryan. Definitely not getting ski season passes this year lol.
I hope you are right, Ryan! 🤗 NY Tristate was robbed of winter ❄️ last year. Let’s get some good snowstorms over here this winter! 🥶 ⛄️ ❤ Love you guys!🗽
Great Thanks.  How about UP Michigan????f irst snowfall ?   How much this winter??? Heating houses going to be horrific
It already snowed in the Uintas in Utah!
Thankkkkssss I got the glasses lol
Thanks so much Ryan, appreciated much , great weather reports. Wishing you a great Friday God bless. 🙏
Hoping for the warmest winter on record for Omaha, NE this year!  I would love to be cycling outside in Dec/Jan/Feb!
Ryan you just cracked me up in the end of this video!!  We live in Arkansas so I would certainly rather have snow than tornadoes as our house got hit in 2019 and now we are glued to your videos anytime we have even a hint of a possibility of a tornado.  You are the best weatherman ever!!
That eclipse happened in NC I believe in 1969. I was 16 😊 And in the early 1980s we had a snow storm.  I believe  we got over a foot of snow here.
Or you can just stare at the solar eclipse and go blind so their is options available to you. I would suggest his sunglasses for it.
I am flying from SC to Dayton Oh Thanksgiving week----Please NO snow!!!!!
@ryanhallyall I'm just south of Nashville in Columbia so I hope I'm included in that measurable snow forecast of yours lol
Can you add mexico and Canada ?
Having snow in mid December would be lovely. We got our Xmas parade and it’s a blast when snowing
I really hope I get snow this year and not one of our typical Oklahoma ice storms lol.
i literally set a reminder for april 8
We always have a white Xmas. Starting Oct 28th. N NY
Good report
West Texas is unpredictable as usual, lol
I prefer WEATHER GEEK or WEATHER NERD .... over Weather Weenie 😂😅  Better yet... how about WEATHER WONK !?  It still has the alliteration,  but doesn't sound weak like Weenie.  😊 You can thank me later @ryanhall
I use my welding hood to look at an eclipse.
I live in the eastern UP of Michigan and I am quite excited for a warmer winter. We get slammed up here in the Sault all the time, and it will be nice to have a bit of a break.
Loved this video!  Ordered lots of glasses for 2024!!!  My Y'all-O-Meter is ready to go!!!
I hope you are right! I want a lot of snow and I want it right now!
The earliest snow I ever saw was around Oct. 1st while crossing the Mackinaw Bridge.  You have to be tough to be a Yooper!
Thanks for the info ryan🎉
I live in north west Georgia and I really hope we have snow this year 😭
Any snow in Vancouver?
Phew I'm just ready for it to be less than 90° and you're teasing us with snow talk!! Feels like forever from now😂
I just need it to not freeze in the eastern Texas panhandle until my tomatoes and peppers ripen. All the rain/hail back in May/June did a number on my garden. The line of beefsteak tomatoes that I've been working on for the past 5yrs can handle down to 27°F, but the other stuff growing can't
I can only pray Dayton Ohio has a mild winter for the simple fact i walk my grandsons to school🙄
Eclipse… Watch the shadows between trees or your shadow, it goes very weird during the eclipse…
It's already gotten the first snow in California
I live in lower Michigan and the past 2 years we had our first snowfall in late October
So for us in the Southeast, everything is the same
No shame in being a weather wienie.  ⛈
@ryanhally’all and @metandyhill thank you for an entertaining and awesome video
Thank you
I’m from Canada.  4 hours north of Toronto but I love your content !!
Florida never participate 😂
To see the eclipse, you can take two paper plates, put a pinhole in one and use it to project the eclipse onto the second paper plate.
Love your updates Ryan! Thanks for that!
I'm part of group called the NEBP, We are sending weather balloons up to observe the eclipse. People from universities all over the country are doing it.
u did good
in Massachusetts 2020 we saw our first snow in like october 29
Just go to Harbor Freight and buy a Weld hood. Its like $5
I'm a weather weenie!! 😂
We don't even have Fall Fest for another three weeks, and it's like 60 days until the slopes are open. Time to wax and sharpen the board...
We have had snow already in South Central Montana.
Can't wait to use my Y'all-o-meter in WV
Noooooooo, no snow
🙏🙏 please please please let south Eastern VA get some snoooow😭😭
Oooohhh Myrtle Beach might get snow thats nice 🥶🌨️❄️
Thanks for the reminder for the eclipse! I knew one was coming my way but I couldn’t remember when.
Cool, I’m in the Nashville area. January 3rd, I’ll be watching 😊
Here in Ca.. La Niña or El Niño doesn’t make much a difference.. example: Last year we were in La Niña and we received a record amount of snow… so I don’t put much weight on the water temps for our weather here in Ca…
I love this guy! Thanks for the best weather updates! Not even traditional news weather updates are this informative and helpful. Way to GO!
I'm in Canada about 25 minutes away from the Walhalla border crossing. Looking forward to snow this year. Summer has been a bummer. Sooner it snows the sooner all this wild fire smoke stops. I hope we get lots
I heard snow at your house Ryan on Halloween ! Your bestest day in white lamo !
I live near Mt. Diablo, Ca. We saw snow up on the mountain last year. Maybe we will get some this year as well. Thanks to you & Andy and all your team for all the information you give about weather. I've been a weather geek for as long as I can remember. I love them clouds!😂
But I don't want to be a weather wennie😢
Trump don't need 'dem glasses!  Jesus protects his eyes! lol
YAY! I'm a weather weenie! Also, moar snow pls. ❄
Welcome to the 25000 year cycle change in the Universe planet patterns. You are observing the Mayan 2012 predictions. People choose to call it 'Climate Change' and blame it on the action of the people. When the location of magnet north moves animal will get disoriented and Earths tectonic plates will get moved. This is absolutely nothing new for the Earth and it is written in stone. The universe will do what is planned for it to do. Coming to your location soon.
Bring on the snow 👍❄️
Earliest I remember snow in SE Ohio is 3rd week of October in 2005.
Thank you Ryan Hall ❤❤❤
I’m ready for winter and some snow never got any in West Virginia last year
Calling me out as a weather weenie, how dare.
Yes, we’re Weather Weenies!
When it snows in SE Texas, it literally shuts everything down. A hurricane hits, people are acting like it’s just another day. All in what you’re used to 😂
I hope hamilton ohio get lots of snow it time ❤❤
I want snow in Charlotte NC 😊
Hearing that winter will be a week later than average here in Michigan, is VERY good news. I'm not in a hurry for snow. Or cold temps. I'm hoping those aren't as bad this winter as well.
Historical data won’t survive climate change. You know about the atmospheric rivers dumping 20 cm rain on the polar glaciers? Reynolds numbers and all that on a system undergoing increasing heating.
Wait, the first snowflakes will be seen at 10:33pm and the snowfall will be measurable on that same day? That's one hell of a snowstorm for Nashville!
Yippee 🎉. I’m in Nashville and love me some snow 🎈🎊. You’re the only one I rely on for weather predictions lol. Don’t even turn on local news cuz you’re more accurate ⭐️. Our puppies will see their first snow this winter 🥶
Man I love all your videos! From, Weather Weenie
Snow on the bear tooth in Montana on sept 16
I am proud to be a weather weenie, I am always fascinated by the weather.
I wonder how stormy this fall season will get with the snow staying away!
Thanks
in indiana we just automatically assume it’ll come in november, and if not then the rapture is coming
Sitting here in the "Autumn heat wave" following the unusually brutal summer heat wave,  I'm definitely ready for a little winter.
Yes im a weather wennie lol
I'm in the white so I don't need to subtract or add 😎
Have lived in Nash 14yrs; excited to see if Jan 3 snow will occur! Let the bet begin!
I live in Nashville, and you bet your butt im gonna see if you're correct! Hopefully we won't be getting another hot Christmas day 😔
Raleigh....snow....😂🤣😂 December???  😂🤣😂🤣😂😂 😜 El Nino???  Snow??? 🙏🙏🙏
Thank you so much Ryan! 😊
If it's milder in the East then why will we have blizzards?
What about Detroit Metropolitan area in southeast Michigan weather. I know we will get hard this winter this year. But past 3 yrs we haven't get any good snow .
RYAN I have ask many times why you have nothing to say about Alaska today you're talking about snow Alaska would be so much more important than whether Florida's having snow are you afraid of Alaska or do you just not have any interest in US or are you not able to predict our weather weather?
I don’t have to wait till 2045 I stare at the sun on a daily basis. 😁
Hopefully , this winter isn’t a bad one. I’m stacking firewood ..  January , February and March. I usually burn about 20 pieces of wood a day ..  I think  we should aim to have more firewood for this winter.
Thank you Ryan
We don't get snow much in Bowling Green, but I'm hoping for a white Christmas this year. 😍
I'm a weather weenie!! 🎉🎉🎉
I know the solar eclipse thing was not related to the snow. But seriously guys if you even have a slight chance to go a solar eclipse is so amazing but also glasses start to sell out really fast close to the time of the eclipse. I personally have already bought my solar eclipse glasses for the 2024 eclipse. But I will be using those same pair in October although it will only be very partial here to still take a look at it. Glad to see somebody on YouTube getting sponsored to showcase these amazing events coming up.
I want to know about pike county Ky 😁
This channel is dope, glad you've found success with it
Hope it’s a safe season.
"It's simple!"  Pierre, SD: *sigh*

Wait a minute.  If the Dude in the parking lot had the glasses, and you were paying 20 bucks a pair, just who was the doofus?  HA!  Really like the vids Ryan. Keep up the good work.
Because of your channel, all my husband's friends call me the weather lady ha ha.  I'm not in Nashville but I am in Camden, TN!

Ya my luck it would be a cloudy day, therefore I wouldn't need any, I could look up at the clouds with normal sunglasses lol.
Who else is ready for hoodies 😄

Anyone else think El Niño looks like Jupiter?
Can you provide information for weather in Canada as well?
Very different how  In Chicago it's been 4 years since we have seen cold and lots of snow. Your video should say same old same old bullshit winter with no snow
Great video Ryan! Thanks for everything you and the team do! Can't wait for a Snowathon stream!

Weather is forecasting the lows for southwest ohio to be in the low 40's (next week) I know alittle too far out to really predict anything with accuracy but...wtf, its too early for that crap!
It’s prolly snowing in Colorado in November again.
It's 90 in Kansas city today don't talk to me about snow

Dont you say that four letter word yet 😂 I am trying to enjoy the nice fall weather in Ohio.
Anyone else in San Antonio, TX salty that snow isn’t in our stars?! 😅😆😂
As someone who lives within the red line, I see this as an absolute win
I LOVE that I live in a sporadic zone!
Thanks legend.

We rarely get snow in my area of Southwest Tennessee. Thanks for all you, Andy, and the Y'all squad do.
I am hoping we see at least some snow over here in the PNW. They have mixed results from either no snow, or heavy snow
