Hello, I'm ' Marcelo Pear and I'm from Rio Brazil. Let me testify before the public about a great herbal medicine doctor name dr wise of africa who helped me with my own illness. I had HIV / AIDS for over 5 years and I was almost going to the end of my life because of the appearance of my skin. All I have in my head is to give up because life does not interest me anymore. One night, my sister told me she had found a doctor on the internet who could cure HIV / AIDS. It did not interest me because I did not believe it. She helped me with everything the doctor asked for, filled out the treatment form for me and even used her own money to get the medicine for me. During a week of using the drug, I started to get stronger, my blood began to flow normally 4 to 7 days later, I started to gain weight, before the 2rd week, my body started to develop, my skin began to grow. After a month, I was tested for HIV and tested negative. I am so happy to be able to say that I am no longer a patient with HIV / AIDS. If you have HIV / AIDS, hepatitis, herpes or HPV, coronary heart disease or any other illness, please contact Dr. WISE. His phone +2349063191711 and his Whatsapp number is: +2349063191711. I wish you good luck, God bless you all. You can also phone +2349063191711

If the weather channel reporter was there, the winds would be 300kph. Then he or she would describe where the wind is coming from on the quadrant of the storm. The anchor would ask is it bad? Oh yes a garbage can just blew over and I saw someone angry with their Wi-Fi service.
I've been wondering when another disaster is gonna happen
🇮🇳🇰🇷🇮🇳🇰🇷🇮🇳🇰🇷🇮🇳🇰🇷🇮🇳🇰🇷 Love 💗 from India 🇮🇳🙏.
Damn hope korea is doin good
Under our apostle paul’s ministry in The King James Bible,we are only saved by believing The Gospel of Jesus Christ 1st Corinthians Chapter 15 verse 1-4.Jesus Christ died on the cross,spilled all of His Blood for your sins,was buried and rose again on the third day.Jesus Christ Spilled Blood is what saves you when you believe this plan of salvation with your heart.
OH NOOO OUR BOYS BTS AND THE OTHER KPOP IDOLS!!!
It’s 2020 but, there’s still a delay when the reporter asks a question to the other person live at the scene..

I don't want to scare anyone but, things aren't looking too great for the current state of the world. But don't worry, there is no need to be scared. Everyone has been offered the most valuable amazing gift in the world. I just want to make sure you guys know that, "15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.  16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. (John 3:15-18 King James Version)" . Men and women have been made sinful since Adam and Eve, the start of our creation, and Jesus has offered a way out. Salvation is a free gift from God given through His Son Jesus Christ who died on the cross for our sins. I want to let you know that you can escape all the trials and challenges coming to this world by having absolute true faith and trust in Jesus Christ. True faith will show through your actions and your thought process when you have truly believed you become a brand new person for the better. You don't have to experience what is going to come to the world, you can be taken out in the rapture and brought to Heaven while these things take place, and eventually, the entire earth will be destroyed and made new for us to live on. This time, the earth will be without sin, and pain, and suffering, and without corruption, without evil, and without darkness. Things will no longer pass away, but life will be eternal. Trust me, there will be soooo much happiness and true joy and love! The world is going to become amazing!  . Do not worry though, if you miss the rapture, and end up going through these times called, "the tribulations", you can still be saved and receive eternal life, however, you will have to go through very tough trials, and most likely be killed for your faith in Jesus Christ. But do not worry, if you get killed for your faith in Jesus Christ, it will be noticed. You will appear before the throne of Jesus Christ, and He will bring you back to life and you will be able to join in the feast and celebration, and receive eternal life as well.  "4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (Revelation 20:4 KJV)" . There is no simple prayer, or action that you can do to "earn" salvation. "8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV)" Salvation is a free gift from God, and all you have to do is accept His gift to you by believing in His Son Jesus Christ whom the gift is given through, and by believing and trusting in what He did for you. Have faith and trust in God! The start of your journey begins with hearing the word of God, then leads to Jesus Christ, which then leads you to the Holy Spirit, which then brings you to the Father! "15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: (1 Corinthians 15:1-4 KJV)" "9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. (Romans 10:9-10 KJV)" Enjoy these scriptures to get you started with the word of God, and begin this journey for you now! It is an amazing journey, and you won't ever regret it!  God will never let you down, and will never fail you. He just can't because He is perfect. There may be times where you may feel disappointed or like things didn't go your way, but it is because there was an even better option for you. God has something even better planned for you. Just know that no matter what, when you have true faith and belief in God, things will always turn out well and be good. Almost like they turn out perfectly! God is great! God is SOOOO amazing! Truly! I want you guys all to experience it for yourselves, and receive eternal life, happiness, joy and God's everlasting, infinite, endless amount of love! . Trust and believe in God, He will take good care of you!  Trust and believe in the Father, trust and believe in Jesus Christ who died for your sins and rose on the third day, and trust and receive the Holy Spirit that gives you strength, teaches you and guides you through life. . I like to think of it like this, there is a road, and two on each side of the road. On one side of the road, is the Father, the road is the Holy Spirit, and on the other side is the Son, Jesus Christ, the son of God. You through your faith and belief will be attracted and led towards this place. You are led to Jesus Christ first, and He takes your hand and guides you back to His Father. He guides you and takes you onto the road, the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the connection, the bridge, that connects you to God, the Father, and brings you to Him, but it takes Jesus Christ to guide you and pay for your price, and make you worthy to step onto the road, the Holy Spirit. From there, the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ work together as one and bring you to the Father. All three, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are God. God is one and in His Power and omnipresence, fills and plays all the roles together through these three things, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. . Take care all of you guys! I love you all! Stay happy! Stay positive! Keep loving each other! I hope you all have a blessed and amazing day! Thanks be to God forever and ever! Glory be to God forever and ever! God bless you all! Amen!
Literally 99% of you won’t see this but God loves you so much. Hope you guys have an fantastic day! (Please Read My Name 🧡❤️)
He’s literally next to the ocean. Seems like a dock, he could slip and the wave could take him. I get it reporting the latest news but keep everyone safe, he was way too close
Honestly this shit happens all of the time around the world. We are hyper aware now because it’s happening to us now. Our first world mentality it won’t happen to us. When I say us, I say Americans. We aren’t special never were and never will be.
Just another day in 2020, nothing to see here
*Not one media outlet has announced that Hillary Clinton lost her appeal and must testify on September 9, 2020 about those 600k+ emails @ 9:30AM. Expect an alien invasion, mass shooting, or a devastating earthquake or some type of huge fuckary.*

ARIRANG NEWS CENSORS.
Catch a lot of the rain and overflow water, then sell it California
Censorship is the handmaiden of servitude    A few weeks ago a woman in Tokyo was being orally raped when she bit off and spit out the dick that was in her mouth.The man was arrested for rape... but the woman was arrested for mayhem. Thousands of women demonstrated in the streets of Tokyo to have the woman set free and not charged.But the women who perform the Japanese Tea Ceremony (Geishas) were against her release. When asked why they said it was not so much the biting off that they objected to b.ut the 'spitting out'SINCE THAT TIME THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE Have requested more information on the outcome of the case.Japanese turned it into a public health issue with their focus on the women's health & survival & less so on the ORAL RAPIST'S pleasure.PUBLIC HEALTH notifications were placed all over the city & on subways warning women that a severed penis could lodge in their throat & suffocate them.It went on to suggest that women take advantage of a publicly funded program which would allow women to carry a plastic oral speculum which basically wires the mouth open with the teeth covered... an open mouth gag!The public notice stated that women should carry such device on themselves at all times & let the potential mouth rapist know she has one & wishes to insert it for the mouth rape.Since a recent survey of Japanese men said they saw little difference between a mouth or a vagina, many Japanese men like the idea of using such a device to get access to the throat & to ultimately treat a mouth, as if it were a vagina... with teeth.
Hang on hang on...H A N G   O N! Did that guy just say 145KMPH winds? That's the same as a Cat 1 Cyclone, which is a minor inconvenience here in Australia.
i hope everyone stays safe affected by this typhoon!
Have some mercy to the reporter. Western media isn't that sadistic ok! That guy might get injured fr the flying debris.. Be safe!!!!

Be Safe those of you in the path of this storm N Korea from San Francisco, USA! All the peoples of the world are enduring mass calamities that have been curiously increasing the last 10 years or so with emphasis on the last 4-5 years when Evil seems to be holding sway over the world. This is a time unlike anything we have faced in quite a while historically, keep friends and family close and fall back on your spirituality for strength. Don't forget to count your Blessings!
God is coming back. To many things happening in the world that are in the Bible. God help us all
