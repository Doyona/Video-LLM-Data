Who will win at the Clash of Champions: Roman Reigns or Jey Uso?
He is a bloodline to the family❤
Man…looking back at these 2 year old clips from this past Smackdown, Jey has really grown as a entertainer, and superstar
This is so messed up wrong with what's going on🚶‍♀️ 🙃 🚶‍♂️
If Roman had stopped I mean they were getting along great and then he goes and he's like its not going to be your moment, then it went downhill between him and uso. If he had just shut up before that sentence, it might habe worked out okay 🙄

Roman Reigns wants to laugh when jey talks...you can see him trying to stay in character lol
Jey the best 😃😄😎😻😇🎑😹💓💕💯

We ain't little kids no more uce I'm a grown man now
That was a fire promo
Movie Grill Roman Reigns Quincy Pierre is Roman Reigns
Facts
And they sale are low also heel
Who care
Roman Reigns gets MORE and MORE pathetic every week . . . He couldn't beat Cesaro on his own . . . Now he's BEGGING to get Jimmy Uso in his corner . . . Hey is nothing more than a lackey for Roman Reigns
I do like that Roman turned heel but i did think there would be more family on romans side
So Reigns is basically Brock Lesnar 2.O, well, at least this one doesn't bounce around a lot.
LOL THE THING ABOUT ONE USO FIGHTING IS THERE TWINS. U FIGHT ONE USO UR GONNA GET THE OTHER............USO TIME BABY
Imagine the Bloodline Vs. The Hurt Business. That would have been a good survivor series match.
CoryMeadows377
Roman stop calling yourself  the head of the table 😕😂😠😠
Nobody remembers jey uso was the first person to ever pin roman reigns in wwe
Tyramey you
romanismycheif
Why does Jay Uso call Roman..Us?
Makes for a great heel
Right t
That man is so messy
Wait what happened to brock lesnar?
We ain't little kids no mo uuuuce! We're grown men now!
Fookn  paul hymen🤮
So this is big news To me
I didn’t know Roman reigns even considered Paul heyman a person of interest in his career
Blithely  Battle
I love how Paul says the reigning, undisputed, universal heavyweight champion Roman Reigns every single time. Just adds gravitas. It's those little things that make him such a great promo guy
Ive always liked the usos and reigns so idk how to feel abt it
Is that really how you treat family that is not how it works dude man you show them respect they show you respect but like that that's your blood that's your blood you can't Roman you can't do that show appropriate words kids can be watching this don't cuss do the right thing guys this goes to all wwe people that fight on wwe
Heyman is so good on the mic with public speaking, I love it
This is a weird storyline, but I'm intrigued.
Roman got rosted
Am I the only person that thinks Paul Hayman is like the Donald trump of wwe my favorite wrestler is Roman reigns but I still don’t like Hayman
im a paul heyman guy 🙌🙌
I still remember Wrestlemania when Roman left and Braun replaced him. So what happened was brain beat Goldberg so therefore Roman was suppsosed to beat Goldberg. I just have to say that’s kind of a big deal
They are blood so is 50/50 who is going to win
If he pats his cheek after the pin I’ll be a Roman fan
what heymen with roman i thought heymen with brock
We would have get into it then
Ngl that universal looking like it got baguette diamonds😍🤣🤣
Why the sadle horn champ..?
My dad: just skip the part where paul heyman talks Me: that’s like 3/4 of the whole promo
I can’t wait til Heyman turns on RR for Brock Lesnar
why is Paul Heyman always be with a Universal Champion
....a lot has changed I see 🤨
JIMMY>JEY
...Reign's manbun seriously hampers taking his heel turn seriously.
I'm hurt this fued is taking place without a live audience by far one of wwe best fueds since the attitude era
Also why do I feel like their setting up an angle where Roman injures Jey to show that he’ll destroy his own family to keep the title and to solidly put him as a heel.
It's really going to be good when Paul Heyman stabs my boy in the back when Brock Lesnar returns. That's when Roman gone turn up again.
Ayo even if they fight they still gon love eachother and dats on samoan blood homie trust im samoan and i know how it is so i really wosh the best for those two
Since when is Roman Reigns a Healer
This is going to be the match of the year.
Then seth now roman I'm losing my bros😭
Brock is gonna come back and do what he did to heyman and angle back in the hood ol days lol
Oh look what I see I see a Brock lesnar wannabe
Jey uso going to have get serious when facing heel roman reigns
Roman wwe top guy and he taking his family with him!
BESIDES PAUL HEYMAN NEEDS TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD OF USING THE LINE HE USE WITH BROCK LESNAR "REIGNING AND DEFENDING CHAMPION"
This heel run is going to be temporary when the wwe opens back up then will Roman turn I guess baby face he's an advocate for the kids fighting leukemia and going to want to see the Face of Wwe good side of Roman Reigns on tv not as the bad guy
I needed more action nxt does this matches better than the main roster
A part if me wants Roman to brutalize jey a drive home the fact he a heel but a part of me don't
a born heel
Yo... can't believe Roman reigns punked out his own cusion lol
I thought hayman was working for Brock Lesner
Heymans promos are great
My 2 favorite wwe wrestlers of all time is the undertaker and Roman reigns
Why does he keep saying reignzing instead of just reigning
“The reignsing” lol
Its better if he does not talk..  believe that
CCCCOOOOORRRRRNNNYYYYYYYYY
Paul actually looks great for his age, but he looks so old too...if you think about it he's one of the few relics left from another time. A better time if you ask me.
Brock lesanar wananabee
They should put Brock on RAW when he returns so we get Paul on both shows
Never in my thought I would here Paul say, "your Defending Undisputed Universal Heavyweight Champion, Roman Reigns!"
I have a feeling that Roman is going to destroy jey uso
Roman became a heel
Paul Heyman is a wizard with the words man Jesus. And Roman is kicking that 🔥
Its all love, blood, and brotherhood
This is the Roman we all wanted a quiet beast that has a good manager speaking for him.
I actually really want jey uso to win
They better perform in this match and make it awesome! They are family and anytime family wrestle with each other those match are some of the best to watch because their chemistry in the ring are something else.
Y'all be saying y'all want jey uso to win but let him win and have it for 4 months y'all get tired of him and quick to say overrated 😂 y'all be killing me
Roman Reigns is NOT a heel right now
Paul Heyman is the promo god. After putting over Brock for YEARS, Brock leaves the company and Paul immediately becomes Roman's manager. And with that, both guys keep relevancy in their respective rights. Great job to the WWE, this idea was honestly genius but the key is the light Paul Heyman brings to any corner
So like what happend to brock Lesnar 🤔
USO NEXT CHAMP
Diggin this Tribal Chief Roman/Paul show
It’s called a promo, kid. If you are going to be the big dog, get someone else to do it for you.
The fact they only out jey in this position for roman to fully turn on his family and be a complete heel. Wwe your so predictable.
Okay Jey wins then heel Romans destroys him and puts him out of action and takes the universal championship back! Then the real “Predator” shows up and challenges Roman for the title for wwe calling it the universal title in the first place! lol 😂 the universe?! Smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
How has nobody jacked off on cam yet
Love Heel Roman!
What if jey wins and his brother returns
No, this is just...no.
Jey Uso gives me Killmonger vibes....this guy is 💰💰 WWE needs to cash in
Good way to replace Brock tho
So what happened to Brock Lesnar?
What’s gonna happen when brock returns
The Usos are my favorite tag team. I talk about them all the time on my videos.  It sucks because Hey has pretty much no chance at winning for so many reasons BUT I'm really happy that he is on this level right now. The most I'm hoping for is that Hey will do really good and really give Roman a run for his money and barely win so Hey looks strong even though he lost
I love this new roman
No more brock Lesnar
*Heyman's a poet and didn't even know it*
4:20 Jey's laugh and reaction LOL!
I don't hate saying this, I REALLY LIKE THIS ROMAN REIGNS!!
The crowd sounds like it’s from WWE 2K
I might pay that 9.99 just to watch this match. LOL
We ain't lil kids no mo USo we grown men now..lol
I miss Paul with the pony tail, hat and trench coat. That Paul would actually get scrappy.
ATLEAST Roman is better than Brock because Brock would have never said a thing
Roman is a good heel and all. But i perfer him not heel
What is WWE gave us a twist and all of a sudden Jey Uso wins the championship
Boring as a face, boring as a heel. Meh!
Do Heyman and Trump have . The same speechwriter or something??
Who ya think is a better 'shield' heal.. seth roman or jon??
Absolutely love that Roman is finally getting the shine he deserves. Enough with the hate, let the man be great.
Where's Brock
is it just me or did roman reigns get finer
Muting Roman was the only way to make him a real icon
Roman reigns awesome
Forgiveness
He just kept it💯, but this gonna be a good match, bc they know how each other fight so this should be good
Where jimmy at
What happened to his voice tho
Is this the one that dates Naomi?
Should have done this is with him yrs ago
I want roman to turn on jey and then attack him
Losers
Imagine Roman lose to his cousin. That would be a shocker
Roman is so hard from holding back his smile and laughing when Jey is speaking
Boring boring
Okay But what about a Samoan takeover? Make a storyline where all the Samoan wrestlers destroy all the divisions the tag team the USO’s the middle titles Samoa joe and the female titles for tamina and Roman leading the pack make it like the family is tired of getting screwed over by wwe and they want to take what’s there’s
roman will win most likely but I want to see Jey win money in the bank or the royal rumble and win
Same lame and boring guy he was before he was a face nothing changed can’t wrestle can’t cut a promo and faked cancer
Heel turn for Roman was the best thing they could have done for him
Haymen can cut a promo like no other 😩👏🏽
Oh I get it hes a mini brock lesnar
Can y’all stop pushing this family junk, we know, but that wasn’t all about that family talking when they was competing for the Tag Team championship and when it was Shield vs Locker Room... We want a REAL rivalry and not a forced one...
How many times do they have to say cousin?
This is good stuff it almost as if they should have done this like 5 years ago 🤔
I like the pairing. Roman needed to be a heel. That way the boos make sense lol
Roman make your classic roman reigns jacket but better like redesigned i dont like you wrestling in a shirt
What a promo.
In this video Paul heyman kinda sounds like Keith lee
Can we get Roman and Paul to change the Universal title to a design that reflects the prestige that a Wrestling title should exude? Something like in the realm of the NXT Titles? I think it'd be great to have a title design to mirror that in the realm of the North American Title or even the NXT Championship
I really like the bigg dog but it was the most wrong move for him to be teaming up with that Jack azz Paul the beast is  going to come back and f5 both of them. ... Lol
Its funny i know when to strike
Roman as a heel is actually a great idea. Haymen is selling this well
That piped in crowd noise is tough for real 😂😂😂
Those cheers and boos sound like  wwe 2k 😂
It's weird seeing a cordial Heyman
It's obvious Roman will retain the universal belt for a while at least until the next year.
Man I wanna see a S.O.S. sons of Samoa faction. Pull all the Samoans male and female. Let them run rough shot over everyone.
Plz tell me the story line ends with uso being the champ. How many times can u give Roman reigns title runs. Y'all r getting boring with the bs. That's why I watch aew now 🤷🤷🤷
I so want jey to win
Jey will win I up so. He deserves it
Whole family sound hood af
Everyone knows Jey Uso gonna win and become the Universal Champ.......😂🤣
We ain't little kids no more ,we are grown men now.
Jey  actually good on the mic tho
Wwe I just realized the other goal for Roman . I give it to y’all . Pretty clever !
Its all love! Barn burner tendencies maybe..........
Possibly laid the seeds for a family faction with one line. This ( the title ) needs to stay with me for the "family"
Jay should join Roman and Paul
It's Cousin vs Cousin.
Thats so lame him teaming up with heyman just regurgitated stuff as usual
About time he became a heel he looks more comfortable as a heel
Don't look at this, look at me I'm gonna whoop yo az!
That is roman Cousin!!!!! wow roman yyyyyyyy!!!!!!
Idk what more that Jey Uso could do to prove that he is worth of a singles run. I haven't watched WWE in years. Him and Roman brought me back. I love this
The tribal chief Roman reigns? Lol what a crock
OMG my beautiful Lord and Savior Roman reigns has come back home 💞
The turn is amazing. He fits so well. Looks so comfortable. Looks like a champion.
The fingerpoke of doom
I like this side of R.R....hunter...this is gonna be such an exciting time for him.....
That guy behind Paul heyman is kinda cute
i cant suport some one who acts like brock lesner so no roman i  dont suport u untill u grow some balls and man tf up and get paul haymen off your back
Its about time roman went heel this is the best turn they have done for him
JAY NEEDS TO UP HIS PROMO SKILLS. . . LIKE ASAP
Caca Let me get 100 likes from saying 💩 Caca
It's going to be a good match not great but a good one
I think we might see finger poke of doom 2.0 jey uso will lay down for Roman
Brock jr
Wheres brock cause we know jey uso aint winning
Uh oh ROMAN found his fire!!!!!
Uso gon lose. This is a throw away story until E is back healthy
Roman Reigns is better as a heel.  His face persona was just Rocky Maivia 2.0; but here, he’s a lot more relaxed and it comes natural to him.
what happen to brock lesnar why is paul heyman  not with him
He right... it's all love
Bullet club Members,wwe version: AJ Styles Adam Cole Bring Aop back Kevin Owens Samoa Joe as the Co - leader of the week's version of the bullet club along with AJ Styles  That's one of the factions that i would create in wwe,wwe's version of the bullet club,also Velveteen Dream would be in the wwe's version of the bullet club also
Please make the whole family a faction (Roman-Universal champ/ Jey&Jimmy-Tag champs/ Naomi- women’s champions) just saying
Roman is gonna pull some shady stuff at Clash to win. Mark my words.
They should’ve turned him heel years ago. He’s amazing
What happened to Brock Lesnar
Respect to my samoan brothers
Nice
Roman still plays bass for Metallica, right?
This heal turn is the reason I love smackdown
Bring back The real Paul hayman GUY
Paul is a future Hall of Famer.
Nothing is forever if roman thinks hes going to be champion forever he's crazy
Tribal chief? Wtf?🤣🤣
See this was supposed to be against Jey and Jimmy Uso but this is what wwe needs
Finally they got it right,he still got something that makes you hate him but this better then cena segments over last decade
Who's cares about that?!
F Roman
I hate to see family members  let business get in the way.
One of these days paul gon slip n call him Brock 😂
All the Roman hating snarks don't know what to do right now.
I wanted this video to last longer so I could hear Jey on the mic 🎤
I really hope Jey wins, this will really boost his career if he does.
What sucks is we know Roman is gonna win.
Why does jey look like odell beckham jr.
Oh Yeah💪🏿🔥
This is literally WWE saying Brock we can and will replace you.
“We ain’t little kids no more use “😂😂😂
2k could write a better promo :0
I LOVE Paul but this is a waste.... Roman not only has lots of followers but he is good on the mic  they need to give Paul to somebody that sucks on a mic and that is going to be pushed towards title opportunities
Roman kind of sounds like Thanos
Honestly I don’t really think he turned heel to me that wasn’t a cowardly attack he just took advantage of the match and won the championship and him winning the champion will earn him a lot of opportunity’s now and I have nothing but respect for Roman and Jay
I have been waiting for years for Paul heyman to declare roman the reigning defending undisputed ... Champion of the world
I can imagine Seth Rollins with Paul hey man he did it with the authority
Bro.....this Roman.......🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
So did Paul Heyman join Roman Reigns just so Brock Lesnar can come back and beat him for the Universal Championship? Ummm I think so🤷🏾‍♀️
I mean I am a huge fan of Roman Reigns and his family I am not going to lie
Know why is Paul Haman with Roman Reigns paul Is just messy he was wit brock lesnar and brock is not in wwe paul just trynna go to the mans who know how to fight side he always have something smart to say out of his mouth Roman was doing good by himself..
I can imagine Roman and Jay playing football when they was little
Am I the only one who wishes they didn’t turn Roman heel?
3:33
Have Daniel Bryan (a real wrestler) come back and make Roman tap out in the yes lock . That’s what you need to do .
I am for Uso!
He’s clearly gonna turn on Jay. Lol it’s so obvious
I am assuming that jay uso is gonna wrestle the air then reigns is gonna come spear him and leave 😂😂😂
This kind of stuff is the reason people watch other wrestling shows
Why is this happening? Come on Roman. Come on Jey. And now, COME ON PAUL HEYMAN. Didn’t Roman and Brock have a dang feud? Why is this happening?   I’m sorry, but I hate that Heyman and Reigns are on the same side
"Ladies and Gentleman" My name is Wobbly Walrus !!!!
I've never like it when Paul Heyman is on the mic. Guy is annoying.
I love Paul with Roman.
The Tribal Chief is a way better name for him as a heel 🤘🏽
Dude wtf Paul Haymen thinks he controls His client everyone would like him if he wasn’t like that now Paul haymen has people have Roman reigns like real everyone used to like him no they don’t I still like roam Reigns but he should let go of Paul haymen and give him back to Brock lesner
To the person that’s reading this:  You’re very intelligent and adorable human! Stay healthy in quarantine  My dream is to have 2k subscribers. I been struggling to get there....
Y’all know Roman is going to brutalize Jey 😌
M o N e Y   p L a N e
I have not watched wwe in a while paul is Roman's announcer now!!! What?
Seems to me like Paul Heyman misses Brock Lesnar..
I can't believe how cool this is
Fill the arenas back up covid is fake
I think this will be great if they turn the Usos heal and have them team up and form an alliance with Roman rings
Who would be surprised if Jimmy helped Roman keep his belt.
Roman The Heel is a vision of heel loveliness. Impeccable Work Vince!
Wrestling sucks even more now with virtual fans 🤣
I don't think Jey Uso is going to win but I think he will put up a better fight than we all expect give him some respect.
Less talky more fighty
This is stupid .. should be reigns vs samoa joe
Paul is the best talker period.
Roman not even trying to fight people that can fight back
Took forever. But as a long term wwe fan roman being heel finally makes me so happy. He's going to be great
Paul is a bum
Lets go Chiefs
The new Brock lesnar 🤣🤣
The fiend got a new puppet. Uso is naive af. Roman is chief big dawg... something is happening here.
I love em both. Idc who wins frrl🤷🏾‍♀️
Wow poor heyman, without Brock he has to resort being the mouth for Roman.
GGs bro, theres no chance of Jey winning or getting dat steak
Like the promo, but is Jay Uso the best WWE could muster?? I'd think with such a huge talented roster that Jay would have been still working the tag team angle and some other higher profile contender would be a better fit..
The acting is hilarious and amusing 🍿
Bruh i have mad respect for Romen
This man is soooo fine
Roman please dont fight jey uso please thats rood please dont
I’m liking this 🔥🔥🔥
I haven’t watch wwe since quarantine started what the f*** happen
I think this will actually be an epic match up can not wait to watch it.
Nah still not buying it
Roman reigns you were my favorite wrestler forever but this new heel of your is not you. After Jimmy and JEY saved you from Friday night smackdown at least give them respect 😤😔
Look at them diamond
It's funny how paul heyman birthday was that day. Happy birthday paul heyman
Roman
Roman Reigns should have been a Paul Heyman guy a long time ago!!!
"We ant lil kids now uso  "We grown man now
Jey will lowkey make Roman look like a star, just like AJ made Cena look like a star.
Read my name
As much as I love the Usos they give up way too easily
Idk why they were so hesitant to make Reigns a heel. He’s good
Reigns is the man lol
Wow Uso is annoying asf on the mic lol
Paul heyman speaks pure gold. Dudes a promo god
But what if jey defeat roman ?
didn’t know these two working together
When did Paul heyman start d-riding Roman reigns? I’m clearly not caught up
remnants reflexion
Dope!!!
I wonder how Jimmy reacts to this
Yo just a suggestion, but what  if Jimmy  uso has a suprise return  and  help  jey win  the championship?🤔
The @ home audience doesn’t look good at all they should make it different or do something else about it
Anyone else actually enjoy the heyman roman thing they got going on
why is paul with roman reigns
New age brock lesnar but shows up lol
after  PAUL  HEYMAN   ATE  ALL  THEPLAYERS  AGAINST   ROMAN  REIGNS     1000 POUND  PIECE    OF   S      T
It reminded me of Day Day from next  Friday.  We ain't little no mo ,come on,🤣
USO’s going for it all with USO’s will win
Size of the fight in the dog and size of the dog in in a fight
roman reigns in a man bun--how pathetic--what a sell out
Sad day in the wwe when jey uso is in the main event. Lacking so much talent nowadays
Paul Heyman did a great job putting over Jey in this promo
They should have Jimmy turn heel and join Roman
Paul Heyman could read a book and put me to sleep because of his voice
I hope Roman destroy him
why did corbin and sheamus have to come out. They totally ruined this promo
Paul Heyman on the mic is gold
Heel Roman is the best Roman
This reminds me of me and my older cousin 🤣
Heel or face, Roman is a bloody wanker.
Reigns didn't beat shamus and Corbin like he didn't beat stroman and the feign because he can't beat anyone and has no right to hold the championship belt such a disgrace and coward
Román is going to win
I wouldn’t want Roman Reigns and Jey USO wrestle against each other because they are family.
I love roman but I want jey to win ;)
Just think, jey uso wins by roll up on Roman, Roman proceeds to beat the brakes off of his cousin which would establish him as a very dangerous heel. Then Otis comes out and cashes in MITB.
Sadly this should had happen years ago....
I have never been a fan of Paul Heyman and it sounds so weird and wrong to me to hear Heyman talking for Roman Reigns. I like Reigns much better as a face.
I love the fact that none of what Roman said felt forced!
Heyman is a weirdo with roman. He's better with lesnar
I See..... 2 Superkicks By Jey Uso, 2 Superman Punches & 2 Spears by Roman Reigns & This will be over fast😂
They laying off wrestlers so otis won money in the bank brief case
They should do a rematch for the title a fatal four way jay is gonna loose
Jey Uso we ain't little kids no more
Jey Uso is gonna win 💯, somebody gonna distract Roman reigns and jey uso is gonna super kick him & uso splash Roman the end .
Jay Use NEEDS to win some kind of championship outside from the tag titles
Haha still using Renee's voice on the outro of these videos.
At least give jey like a month. It would be so well i love both uso. But jey is the shadow of jimmy so wwe please let him get the title
Damm that was good ..i aint no fan of roman but heel hes way better
Every time I see WWE today it looks like fans were allowed in the ring and are given a chance to pretend to be wrestlers.
Wait why what happened plz tell me
Since Roman Reigns is no longer the top face of the company I guess someone else will have to fill that vacancy.
People keep saying Roman is great as a heel... What about this segment makes him a heel? Acting like a total babyface here.
My main question is where’s the other uso brother ??
Roman was going to tell him family is out the picture when the title on the line.  Notice Roman didn't help him or nothing
Heel Roman is best for business
Can we just a new dangerous alliance reigns nakumura cesaro & pick 1 more guy and a woman
We ain’t little no more uce!    Someone bout to gets. A grown man beating 😬
I like how Paul started stuttering when he said Roman deserves the thanks! Makes it seem that Roman is really really dangerous!
Funny though is this don't make roman a better wrestler😂. Only thing you'll get out of this is Paul Heyman saying "RO-MAN Reinsss"
Roman regins just turn heel when he got booed
I hate this idea of Paul and Roman together we all know that outcome let's treat Roman like he's Brock Lesner for 6 -7 months WM time frame Brock comes back Paul betrays Roman thats not a prediction ladies and gentlemen thats a spoiler LOL
I love both of them but Roman Reigns will retain. Believe That
I Can't hate Roman lol even if he has a persona like Brock now, this man talks for himself lol.
What happened to Jimmy uso it's only jey uso
I could see this Roman becoming mainstream
I can't wait for the Fiend to rip that man bun off Roman Reigns skull, so he too can follow the BUZZards
He needs to stop saying "Reignsing"!🤦‍♂️
He literally replaced Brock Lesnar’s role 😂
So Roman is the new Brock?
Wouldn't it be a upset if jey wins the championship
Why u say that to your cousin
I don’t know about y’all but this story is hot
That was a quality promo.
Roman was always the man, just bad booking. He made the Shield legit, we all knew it. The decisions to go with Rollins ?  he was winy,  irritating voice almost cringe worthy,  and he dominated Roman,   fix this, let Roman get revenge
why would jey wanna fight his own cousin
Roman reigns
Goodluck to jey man my best support💯💯
I need a Bloodline Samoan faction with Paul Heyman at the side ASAP. Smackdown needs dominance who better to do it
roman reigns the greatest true champion
wait till roman spears paul heyman
Thats bull
Roman still going to be the reigning defending undisputed universal heavyweight champion of the world
This is the Roman I've been waiting for. The dominate heel he should of been years ago.
this matchup is stupid. im not convinced .. not hyped.. wwe is doing a horrible job.. AEW AEW AEW!
horrible promo smh
Best decision wwe has ever made. Paul heyman by roman side is just great!!
Roman reigns and jey usos roman reigns is been a lot like brock leansr he can come out whenever he wants and he can fight whenever time he wants this new dark side of roman reings is going to help him win his match on Sunday on September 27 at the clash of the championship par per view angist his own blood line his custin someone who is like family to him jey usos for the universe championship at the main event lets get usos crazy and the big dog has been unleash
Heres what i hope happens at clash roman beats jay offers jay his hand to help him up then outta no where otis comes in and trys to cash in mitb then jay helps roman keep his belt and the usos and reigns become a heel stable
Fake crowd noise is SOOOOOO  STUPID !!!!!  RR  EVEN STUPIDER !!!!
I lowkey wanna see a Samoan stable with reigns and the usos with or without heyman
Lesnar 2.0 except Roman can talk on the Mic now.
i think whats gonna happen is  jey is ultimately gonna give in and align with roman. jimmy too probably down the line when he recovers from his knee injury, then samoa joe is gonna come up and challenge for the title. cause if you remember, joe and roman aint blood. according to the story line they still aint straight so this is gonna solve that storyline with joe probably coming out on top at wm. samoa joe deserves to run with the title. the dude is unadulterated talent.
I always thought Jimmy was the star, but this is MAKING Jey Uso. Whoever’s idea this was is a genius
Need to form a shield 3.0 with jimmy and jey uso. Anyone agree?
The First guy who pinned Roman ever in wwe
I like dis new Jason momao Roman heel he's da new sdl heel aquaman🤽‍♂️
Let's hope Paul Heyman don't turn against Roman Reigns like he did to CM Punk!
Yo that whole segment was so down to earth. I felt like I was in the family
Oh bow wrestling sucks nowadays. None of these wrestlers can't  hold rick rudes jock
Bla bla bla we need action
Why can’t they have also the live stream audience sound ?
I will go with myself!
If jey uso wins I will be kinda surprised
If only WWE wasn’t scripted and we couldn’t already see what outcomes will happen at ppv’s.
Still unwatchable with no live crowd imo
Stupid fans putting their thumbs down don't know nothing about wrestling
This was heyman’s worst promo
I will have to say props to WWE for letting us have a heel Reign he is miles if not 100 times better. Sucks that you waiting this long for this to happen.
Roman just needed a mouthpiece.
Y is he with Paul I would have never thought he would be with him
I want jey uso to win
Putting Heyman with Reigns was such a good move. I like him more as a heel.
Hey uso will win yes sir I want namio to because hitting in the bed
Wow. He works so well as a heel. Wish they would of thought of this... a decade ago.
“We Not Little No More, We’re Grown Men” Enough Said, Prepared To Be Dog Walked At Clash Of Champions Jey
All that pipped in noise lol
I think jimmy is going to help his brother
Soooooo am I the only one who wants to know where the bg noise is coming from?
He took out Big E for the Uso.
Jimmy is clearly the better talker and worker
Lame lame
Brock might come back as a face.
Reigns is good as a heel.
Roman reigns hopefully
The best heel in wwe history
Hey looks so much like Dwayne Johnson
Roman reigns is brock Lesnar now? Lolol
soo wwe thought putting roman reigns as a heel with paul heyman....how many times they think this will work???
We’ve been waiting for this Roman for a long time.
"We ain't little no more Craig!"  🤣😂😅
You know they’re gonna give it to Roman but it would be hella cool if jey win the uv championship
If u were to carve out the perfect man he would look like Roman reigns ....people hate beauty n perfection so much....even the haters know Roman has it all the looks,body,charm,He's tough,cool and he's a good man
Paul is more quieter and smoother with Roman
Does anyone actually believe that Jey Uso is going to become world champion 😂
I feel like they should change his theme. They need to change his persona from The Big Dog, to The Tribal Emperor
⌚
i hate that paul heyman is liked know
I love how Jay can keep his cool other Superstar would  just got beaten up
I remember when Paul had guys he didn't take for all of them except for Lesnar. So why tf is he doing all the talking for Roman
Roman seems more relaxed being a heel again. He's going to do things on his own terms and he only listens to one person.  Paul Heyman.
4:45 Is that Renee young?
Why...does it seem like production is using an audio track for the crowd while the "crowd" itself has their mics on mute? Classic Dunn 'n Vince.
@WWE WHATS GONNA HAPPEN TO PAUL HAYMEN WHEN BROCK LESNAR RETURNS I GUESS SUPLEX CITY
“With this payday, the whole fam gettin’ new teeth.”                               -Roman Reigns
Is my homie Roman wearing True Flights
Is that Renee Young voice at the end?
That smirk on Roman Reigns face when Jay was talking is so cute. You can tell that they love & proud of each other.
It's all a ploy. Uso is in on it. He will lay down for Reigns.
Nah Jey gotta win
Two weeks with Paul E and he's figured out how to work the stick?  Best Reigns mic work I may have ever seen.
Roman is going to brutalize him full heel turn
Roman has to retain
Renee 😭
Maybe if brock comes back Paul will run back to brock and roman will be back to the big dog because right now he's the little dog and I love the saumoa family and roman Is my favorite. So let's see what's going to happen
Now paul heyman talking for roman reigns now thats crazy like i thought he speak for his self dude
Sometimes you have to be   the villain. Panthers take notes....because Professor Reigns is going to teach you how to dominate, and eviscerate your opponent.
Roman longest reigning universal champ is in the works
We all kno jey gonna lose 😂
It’s so funny how they both are trying so hard not to laugh cause they can’t take each other seriously😂😂
Boring
The acting is so terrible
Román should be like Kurt angle in tna win all belts
I want to see jey beat roman for the belt then jey vs big e vs roman for the belt at wrestlemania and if possible otis cashes in at survivor series for both wwe and universal championship
Roman used to be my favorite superstar but idk if I should bc I loved when he was just a regular guy and now hes just a random guy and things have changed he wants to change on his family
This is the best smackdown  been in along long time  Roman at his best  an Jay uso going kill it
I just saw that there is a THIRD USO brother
I still can’t believe Haymen is with Reigns 😱
The "Reignsing?" Lol why does that sound like Roman's idea.
Don’t act surprised when they don’t actually fight and they just make a new faction
Yo... Not gonna lie... LOVE ROMAN as a heel hahahahaha
Yeah its All Love at tha end of tha Day but its just business Jey Uso gotta see roman reigns as his enemy dont ack soft once that belt is on tha line its a Family Business💯
I never would’ve thought jey uso would be this big but for sure i dig it
Roman not being mean when he said that he telling the truth Vince was not gonna let him him any way
Honestly I really think roman should watch his back with Paul cuz see Paul has a history lol just ask cm punk
Why do they keep saying cousins when Roman is their uncle?
Roman because Vince won’t take the belt off of him until he finds another MAIN EVENT CALIBER superstar to dethrone him. Jey is not a big MAIN EVENT CALIBER superstar in Vince’s eyes.
Eat sleep conquer repeat.  Wreck everyone and leave.
The Realism In The Fact Roman Helped Propel Jey To The Main Event Made That "This Has To Stay On My Shoulders" Line 5x Better...I'm Digging This Roman Reigns !!
Am I hearing "reigns-ING"?
Wow. Jay about to get squashed in the “Main Event”
I’m all for Pauly being behind Roman but the in-ring promos are too similar to Brock’s. Roman is standing in the ring doing the exact same thing as Brock.
I hope this is where Roman still wins but Jimmy returns and the Usos have respect for Roman/Paul and they become the new "Shield". This will give the Usos a run at the Tag Titles and Roman still the best heel in the buisness. And lets say they do face for the tag titles, they win but after they win they attack Nakumura and Cesaro so that way the whole family is heel
Didn’t Roman Reigns absolutely hate Paul? 🤔
This should be a good match. I hope Roman fights instead of just coming in towards a match at the end, hitting the spear and winning.
Yeah I like this heel Roman
WWE should create some type of Samoan type match when Samoan wrestlers battle each other.
Reigns be making these T-shirts fasts
It sound like Paul misses Brock
Roman Reigns do more talking then Brock Lesnar did when he was working with Paul Heyman
Jimmy will make a return to help jey
I want Roman to get so angry at the crowds response that he throws Heyman out of the ring and cusses out the audience.
They should have been gave Roman a guy like Paul on the mic for him
Hey
Paul Heyman Can Sell The Bible To Satan He’s That Good Of A Talker
I knlw thw off air convo after thia was hilarious
Roman is acting like Brock...
Jey Uso may not become champion at clash of champions, but he may become champion in the future.
THAT is what Roman needed,,,,a mouthpiece who’ve got his back. 🤨
I hav to give paul made respect for this he didn’t disrespect jey or talk bad about his family
Roman will always be my gav😊😁
I dig the tribal cheif thing
The more I hear Paul and Roman together, the more I love this duo
When Jay finally makes it to the big leagues
Jey uso is the new Roman reigns cause Roman is a heel
I don’t see Ambrose in early videos no more
So Heyman went from the conquering beast to now the tribal chief interesting...
Paul Heyman is such a smooth talker
Crazy because this was Big E's time to shine.
I dig the Heyman/Roman pairing.
The Usos were tweeting when he turned heel and now they are beefing. Lol
Against my blooooood
Roman Reigns is so lame
This is sad af wwe is weak
Not so heel yo because he got love for his cousin its more like ge got a connection idk someone tell mw whats going on with him
GOJAYUSO
roman thats your family
I love them both and rlly don't care who wins. but i will say this, if paul haymen is gonna be his back-hand then plzz dont turn him into the neck Brock Lesner🤦🏽
Finally WWE you are doing the right thing with Roman. 6 years to late but it’s still the right thing. Now he just needs a new theme song that’s it’s 👍👍👍👍
Roman Reigns Sucks!
Hey Paul Newman go back to days of our lives where you belong and quit playing all these soap operas 🤣😂👏
I wanna see jey join with Paul and roman
Idk if it on perpose or what but I keep thinking Roman will just randomly spear Jay.
They're family best cousins, they cant hold their composer. You can tell they just want yo laugh
Big E vs Reigns is gonna be money!!! Btw, where does Otis fit in with all this?
What happen to Jimmy Uso since Jey been fighting by himself?
Lmao y’all nerds in these comments don’t even realize how awkward this whole video was 😂 and is
When I saw the title ........ Um ok
Blood or business will see 👍👍👍
I be wondering how Brock feels about all this
Man it’s like Roman wanted to take his FINGER and POKE Jey as he was saying just like they were kids, he was gonna beat him. I have a feeling Jey is DOOMed at Clash of Champions but I’m sure Jey won’t be taking this LYING DOWN.
Roman Reigns looks horrible with his hair up
I REALLY CAN'T CHOOSE THEIR BOTH MY FAVORITES I LOVE DA FAM MAN THEY SAMOAN SO AM I SO I REALLY CAN TELL WHERE THEIR COMING FROM I JUST HOPE THEY CAN PUT THE FIGHT BEHIND THEM AFTER FLASH OF CHAMPIONS💯💯🇦🇸🇦🇸
I NEED TO START WATCHING AGAIN
Bro i love paul heyman soo much man hes soo good on the mic
I’ve always been a fan of Roman even when ppl hated him so I hope he wins
It's super simple, but I like the Roman promo. Subtle stuff. Not moving a lot. Using words of respect, but then interjecting stuff like "Don't look at this right now, look at me". I like it
They probably had matches as kids for THIS
I want Roman Reigns to win but Jey uso man he better watch out man and you know what idc who really wins tbh and I give full respect jey uso man🔥
Y Roman do jey like that
Wow he did not say hi to his blood
Oh, dang! It's Wobbly Walrus!!!
WWE should have uploaded this to their youtube, gives roman more credibility
Because we've paired the Usos so much, we forget how good both Uces can move. But Jey Uso has individual potential, and it's good they're showcasing that while Jimmy's recovering.
I’d love to see the other uso come back and heymen manage all 3
If Roman left WWE I'm not going to watch WWE again  💯💯💯 Roman is the greatest wrestler in the history of Wwe
Tribal chief!! LOL!
It's kind of  Weird back we I was a kid and whenever someone from the  Hart family was fighting each other WWF always made it seem like it was  Tearing the family apart .But with the  Samoan family they make it seem like it's a  Badge of honor I understand  maybe in   some  cultures it is some I think this one time fight needs some more  Story more debt like if Jey say something like everything was handed to you from day one or your father didn't become a WWE superstar mine did that title is my  Birth right and  Roman reigns comes back with yes he did  Wearing a diaper your dad my  Cousin was a joke to this company and business. Like get some heat  flowing between these 2
This is so bad 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I like this calm serious side of Roman. Working with Heyman is paying off.
Them: It's all love here WWE Universe: right....
I would love to see Jey win the match and get the belt.  But it's not gonna happen.
Roman is still wack
That's how it goes off lol .😂
lol they're not related.
I hope jay beats him, that would cost for Roman to snap and beat jay up, and that will build to a bigger feud
Roman is such a good heel he makes people like the baby face he’s against
Let’s Roman be Roman 😒😒😒
Roman being a puppet is not who I wanted heel reigns to be
Roman is 🗑️
“After that, it’s all love.”
I think odis would make a better champ over the vince puppet roman
What if Roman let’s Jey Uso win just you destroy him and win the title back
This match is going to be 🔥
I’m not gonna lie... the blue Universal Championship is starting to look good
It’s gonna feel weird to watch 2 cousins beat eachother for a belt
i want jey to win but it’s not gonna happen hopefully this turns into the usos and roman being in a faction of some sort
Why his hair look like that?!? 🤣😂🤣
Bro him and his family needa join up with heyman and be the SAMOAN DYNASTY. Now they would be the next HART FOUNDATION
Actually they 2nd cousins.
Heyman hyped Jey up like a main event player!
If only jey would win but we all know who's winning
jey uso dethrone a king debraved a bro & solved a riddle lol somebody give paul a grammy
I’m getting Brock lesnar vibes ..🤦🏽‍♀️ hate it
Still using Renee’s voice at the end? Hmmmmm
I’m pretty sure at the end of the show win jey held up romans hand which was the same hand Roman was holding his title I think Roman said to him don’t touch my title again or something like that
Roman is going to win. I'm just gonna spoil it. No way that WWE is gonna let J Uso win the title that soon.
He earned it but you didn't
The only man who can defeat Reigns is Goldberg... I'm gonna see this on 2021.
Jesus...Paul can really cut a promo and I wish I had half the charisma and speaking ability he did.
Roman aligning with Paul Heyman, is like me aligning with Quentin Tarantino😌😁
You tell em wobbly walrus
Jimmy uso gonna stab jey uso in the back and help roman reigns win the match
He just gave a dj Khalid speech lol
Tribal chief TF 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dethroned a king, braved a brogue and solved a riddle.  Heyman putting people over with poetry.
I forgot they could have Jey win and have Roman win the rematch like if you think about it Brock is coming back so I wouldn't be shocked if this was just part of a huge long storyline where someone interferes and helps Jey win or Brock comes back and attacks Roman because he's jealous!
I'm proud of Jey uso 👍🏾💯
What happens to jimmy?
Hopefully they get a feud with the Usos and the New Shield for 2021!
So Jey is last years Kofi Kingston without the Cinderella story! So who will win? Jey or Roman...Paul wins!
Roman Reigns as a heel with Heyman has so much more character than Brock Lesnar and Heyman. Reigns as a heel is what fans have wanted for years.
like your video Soo Mach
F ROMAN GO JAY!
Good on wwe Build up Roman so big e’s inevitable win will be better He will win the universal title right?
I heard that, I was watching live
we need a samoan faction, the usos and roman, with paul as the advocate
I haven’t watched in months, they really use the crowd noise from the game
Roman  reigns is the best wwe Wrestler in his time but wit Paul Hamen it’s weird
Who wants Roman To win or Jay uso to win
Why is Paul Heyman so comfortable with being that FAT?!?
Bring back the paul heyman guys
If Jey wins....
Roman Reigns has always been my favorite superstar but he's soooooo much better as a heel
Heyman Roman pairing already looks awesome
Heel Roman is too good
Where the other uso?
Give him a new theme song
Paulie Dangerous with yet another outstanding promo
Paul looks like he misses Brock I don’t blame him Brock needs to come back so we can get the old Roman back 💯💯
Since Roman reigns started to work with Paul heyman he has been so mean to jey uso who is his cousin like is that ok
You can tell Paul E wanted to laugh so bad 🤣
Going to Heyman story doesnt make sence he went again brock and Heyman  for how long
I love it . Can't wait to see it . Love both of them . But I hope Roman reigns wins tho. But if Jey uso  wins  that's cool too. Big fan of both
this match gone go crazy
Brother Cuz v.s. Brother Cuz There R times when U'VE got to Fight 1 of your Man members It's very HARD DECISION but it's Life
Love this Roman Reigns
Paul Heyman needs to form his own fresh stable starting with Roman Reigns
Walrus!
I want jey win but we all know wwe ain’t gonna pull that trigger ever
Last !
One of the best promos I’ve seen in a min
Miss Brock
Happy birthday to Paul Heyman once again 🎂
Jey Uso is the future IC Champion for sure
Cringe.
I feel like when he looses he is going to quit
Jey
This match finna be good. Plz WWE give them 20 mins or more so they can put on a 5 star match
That’s not a prediction or spoiler, the tribal chief Roman will destroy his cousin Jey for that Universal Title. Roman as a heel is so good!
