Bamford is absolutely class and a true ambassador for the game / sport. He should be in the England squad & teach the boys how to be a professional.
Super league has sense it's the uefa and fifa are the problem
2seasons back to back we getting tired ?  Try working upto 12hours shifts and sleeping on min 5hours..pfffttttt
So humble
Sir I salute you,  Great comments...
You know what's even worse, I applaud him for saying that, what a guy, the fact that he's said this and it's gone so unnoticed just shows you where everyone is at unfortunately..
Ladies and Gentlemen this is why Bamford had the chance to go to Harvard University incredibly intelligent man.
I have a system for the new champions league. What about 2 groups consisting of 16 teams each and everyone needs to play eachother 2 times. The top 8 of each group advanced to do the playoffs as we know and love them. Please copy this and spam it in twitter and instagram.
What a sound minded kid
1:28 what an amazing point he makes, so true right
Mr Bamford, you're a boss my guy. Bloody brilliant
2:22 balls finally dropped Bambo 🤣😂
Forced organ harvesting, the taking of vital organs from unwilling donors, is one of the worst crimes perpetrated by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and it is ongoing. To evaluate the current situation and find a solution to stop the atrocity, the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (ETAC) held an online forum on February 24, 2021. Over 40 elected officials from various countries along with 117 organizations attended this event.   The video recording of the forum, titled “Conference on the CCP’s Forced Organ Harvesting,” is available to view on ETAC’s website. Several recent articles on Minghui have reported on presentations by legal experts, ethics scholars, and elected officials. Today we focus on a presentation by Ivan Vilibor Sinčić.  Sinčić is a Croatian politician and chairman of the Human Shield Party, as well as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). He said during his speech that the forced organ harvesting is the worst human rights violation by the CCP and that Falun Gong practitioners are the main victims. He called on the international community to condemn and sanction the CCP for this tragedy.    Vilibor Sinčić, Member of European Parliament from Croatia, talked about organ harvesting in China on February 24, 2021.  Victims Are Primarily Falun Gong Practitioners Even when compared with egregious human rights violations including forced labor, arbitrary detention, concentration camps, and torture, forced organ harvesting is by far the most serious human rights offense, remarked Sinčić. Very often the crime of forced organ harvesting takes place when the victims are alive and conscious. The victims are largely Falun Gong practitioners because their physical health is usually very good.   MP Sinčić said the forced organ harvesting is part of the CCP's systematic persecution against ethnic minority groups, political dissidents, and religious groups. An example of the CCP's oppressive policies is the political suppression in Hong Kong. Living in the 21st century today, we have witnessed the large gap between China's human rights violation and the universal rights that everyone should be entitled to.   Sinčić said that many people are not aware of the CCP's human rights violations. They do not know about the mistreatment and medical experiments on Uyghurs in concentration camps. As a result, he said, we need to raise awareness of the issues and publicize the information.
I love this one man ✊🏿 my n#gga
Patrick Bamford is a natural tv star in the making .. intelligent , extremely likeable yet still remains humble
Bamford is such a lovely person.
New England Captain speaking like a real leader. Fair play to the lad.
This guy is always as real as it could get.. his interview s are refreshing
2:22 goosebumps started
2:45 he was telling the truth.
If players and managers are paid less than $5,000 per week, they do not need to be in the Super League.
Stop the Super League 👎🏼
I can't understand all these Super League naysayers. All they are talking about is how bad it is and how it'll kill the football spirit. What the heck is the football spirit anyway? They use fancy Robin-Hood-like communist slogans: "Created by the poor, stolen by the rich". Was it stolen though? I tend to think that it was refined, developed, and brought to a new level. What football would look like without great managers like Perez? I doubt that we would have all these nice big stadiums.  It has suddenly become bad to be rich. Although, the only thing that differs between the rich and the poor is that the latter are too lazy to work as hard as the first. Perez was able to attract previously unimaginable investments for the creation of the Super League. Undoubtedly, this will only benefit the development of the game.  People for some mysterious reason desperately support UEFA. But what have they done for the development of football? All they seem to do is to fail big clubs. Hence, the CEOs had to act to save their businesses. And be not mistaken, a football club first and foremost is a company. Thus, its main role is generating income. And there's nothing bad about it. Put yourself in Perez's shoes. What would you do in his situation? How would you act? Imagine the US government telling Tim Cook to cut down the production of iPhones because America needs more Motorolas. Hilarious, right?  UEFA has shown its real face of greedy bureaucrats, dictators, and usurpers in this situation. People who threat to ban anything are not good. But even their threats would benefit the Super League. They don't favor letting players leaving for national matches anyway. And why do people fight so much for national leagues and competitions? Do they promote patriotism? Isn't it just another word for racism? It would explain why there are so many so-called 'fans', who are ultras, in reality, supporting UEFA. If you still don't understand why the Super League is a good idea and why UEFA is a harmful organization, I would highly recommend you read some of Ayn Rand's books.  Anyway, I would like to appreciate Florentino Perez and his partners for this bold move and to wish to overcome all the challenges in the nearest future. In the dark times, we live indeed.
ALS0 CAN WE CALL UPON MEGAN MARKLE TO SAVE THE DAY.
People talk about Racism like its Human Trafficking
Player of the season for that comment alone.
Patrick is a top lad. Honest and truthful answer. Respect
This GUY spoke some facts ✊🏿
Massive respect for Patrick!!
HYPOCRISY from fans, uefa, fifa, epl, sky and players are mind battling
You can tell this guy isn’t your average footballer. Hats off to him
dazn fu, its ur money funding super League
All you care about is money. This town needs a better group of criminals
All of the 6 clubs from england, LEEDS IT  IS
Let's crown West ham epl champions and sing glory glory Leeds United .... RIP so called big six and thanks Manchester United for repaying our loyalty with this decision glazers and woodword's were always snake 🐍 and reason behind United downfall but never expected this from my club for whom I have bled many a times ... RIP Red Devils, from now on football is no different than Vince McMahon's WWE, Man United betrayed and stabbed me in my heart killing my love for football for a shitty super league🙏 shame on u united
Am jealous of his eyebrows
So your telling me Kane is out of the World Cup because of the super league ?
DAZN of all people can’t say a word with how they stripped premier league football off traditional television after decades get in the bin
Such a quality striker excited to see the future
That’s a mans man right there ❤️
Good talker future pundit
My wee cousin took one look at him and thought he was Daniel Radcliffe.
Well said 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
"racism" another brainwashed simpleton...
Funny how people complain it’s about the money (instead of the fans!), like it hasn’t been for decades. It’s okay when the money buys international players so your club is more successful so it... makes more money.
He has a point. These super league wannabes are scum.
Least he's pointed out UEFA are no saints either instead of being emotional bandwagoners like the rest of Twitter. Respect.   UEFA deserved this. They've been awful with FFP, racism and the Qatar fiasco, not to mention biased refereeing. Now the carpet's been pulled off their feet and they're fettering.   English football should never have allowed foreign ownership of football franchises in the first place. It's greed driven inevitability.
Champions League = Steve Rogers  Super League = John Walker
We love you Patrick. Keep soaring
The players should be happy now that they can earn more.
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Funny how sky hasn’t posted this video on their YouTube but posted Milner’s
Are DAZN going to show the clips of James Milner coming out and criticizing the super league? DAZN have the streaming rights for it, so expect lots of people speaking out being muted by them.
This is kind of indirectly using the fight against racism to justify some businessman hijacking the game we love. Not everyone who raised their voice last 24 hours didnt do that because they are loosing money. They did so because they are loosing the game they love.
Can’t wait too see Leeds in the champions league
Still waiting for Sky Sports to post this...
Jaden Sancho is in the right place
It's this peasant chance to play in Europe and become a first team England striker.
This guy is unbelievably nice
1:07
someone give him a fukkin tissue
It is unfair the players pay the prize and suffer for a decisions made by their clubs owners and they had no say in it😞☹️
I like this man
Who dis
League like la liga and epl gets to say but why is fifa and uefa talking after making nations league???
Football is a Global Gambling Entertainment Industry. Fans ? The owners do not think the clubs exist for fans.
Super league to world... the world is all about money... and European love money.... so super to di world......💰💰💰💰💰
Dembele might as well come to Leeds now that Barca are in that corrupt league so he can play for France since he’s a Leeds fan
Let me get this straight Arsenal and Liverpool draw to promoted sides and they think they are so good they should have thier own league with only the best teams?  These teams cannot beat the bottom teams in the league consistently when they have multiple seasons being unbeaten then talk to me about super league.
Next "A new soccer playing with hands and touchdowns...and home runs"
Especially with that racism comments Patrick bamford just gained a new fan
Some craic DAZN posting this, money grabbing bastards
Dubai stadiums 🏟️ will be packed
Real talk 💯👏🏿
Such a good communicator - love when pat is interviewed !!
If super league is coming, then I will pray that the Corona will not go so that no one will go to stadium.#say no to super league
Clueless idiots bring racism up .. its called hatred and crime .. if you’re talking about someones emotions getting hurt over verbal abuse suck it up butter f’ing cup
They beat City with a red card and draw Liverpool, Leed deserve much better than this !!
The reversal he gave about how this same uproar is nowhere to be found when it's to do with racism or abuse. Insane point. Love Bamford now, what a lad.
Little bit ironic that DAZN uploaded this but we move, Bamford makes a good point
Dickheads on here saying "o it just replaces the cl". Mate they'll kick you out of everything. Every single fan channel, pundit an ex player is telling you this is wrong.. and you are of the opinion that it's a good idea? Matt from Adelaide who's a "Liverpool fan", who prolly doesn't even know where Anfield is nor who Skanky is.
Classic for Bamford. There are more serious issues to discuss than the super league. Racism for example. But the reporter just wanted some dirt on the supper league. Lol. I am a fan and I support the super league. Why not?
The interviewer was rooting for Liverpool; that's why he swears right at the start.
I’m so glad Bamford spoke about the lack of care for racism in the football world
Someone get him a tissue ffs
Seems like leeds should be in the super league over Liverpool
I hate him but fair play 👏👏
DAZN got some nerve since they’re buying the rights to show the Super League, literally funding it
So Dazn post videos slamming the super league and then bid to broadcast it. Smart business. Make money on both sides.
Respect to Bamford idc if I'm a MU fan and we have heated rivalry with Leeds every word Bamford spoke I stand by that and again respect to you m8
Racism is code for anti white.
I am cancelling my dazn subscription due to the fact of the super leage and dazns reported association with the super league.
Hey DAZN you lot better not be part of this nonsense as well...
This type of USA-style franchise football must not happen in Europe ever. The 'big six' owners - John Henry/FSG (Liverpool) The Glazers (Man United) Roman Abramovich (Chelsea) Sheikh Mansour (Man City) Stan Kroenke  (Arsenal) and Daniel Levy (Spurs) are dragging the respective clubs through the mud. These parasites need to go and fans have to stand up and say #NoSuperLeague
Nice bit of vacuous virtue signalling from Bamford.
What a guy ... honestly and bravery
What a proper lad
Liverpool finding it difficult to beat Leeds imaging them in the super league 😂😂😂😂
Pessi is finished
Hey canada, y’all alright up there? -usa man
1:28 what an amazing point he makes, so true
I just thought about something!!! With all these big players being Banned from international events... Imagine If we see Teams Like San Marino Win the Euros 🤯🤯🤯🤯😂😂😂😂
good lad!
No to super league 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Lets Go European Super League. The Future Is Here !!!
I can tell theres a upwards trend, from now you will start to see more players speak out on it.
He kinda looks like Jurgen Klopp
Leads United is so much fun to watch.They will be in Premier league for long time.Big credit to their coaching staff.
Racially abusing somone: 10 match ban Staying at your club when they joing the super league: indefinite ban from all uefa competitions!
Rate the guy for calling out uefa for their poor decisions about racism
Our England line up if it happens - Pope, Lamptey, Coady, Mings, Justin, Ward-Prowse, Bellingham, Rice, DCL, Watkins, Bamford
Nice man ,great player.
DAZN sucks!!!
Can’t wait to watch the super league on DAZN.
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is our striker for England now!
Nah Screw Dazn they are part of the deal to broadcast the new “Super League.” How are they going to post this and remain coy screw off!! A neoliberalistic approach to everything is not the solution. There is the romantics of football that made us all fall in love. Money is the second most important thing, only behind money :(.
what a bright young lad
So ironic 3.5 Billion bid from dazn to shoe it
#notosuperleague
a refreshing perspective
