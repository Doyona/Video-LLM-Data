Actually insane how bad Harry is
They knew about the side gate because well they probably had the address and scoped it out or callux had filmed it in when he snuck into your house video
ong if i had all the perks like that im doing 100 rounds
We've all played zombies with a harry before 😅
I know Harry’s so loveable it’s genuinely super annoying to watch him play this game he’s awful and Ethan’s reaction when he died after they gave him their money was justified
can we get Jingle Hells Bo6 zombies?
Lol😂what was with all the intense music built up. I was so waiting for summa to happen
Bro Harry's actually soo bad at games. Like it's so jarring tow atch him play
Harry got that brain damage
Bring it back
Ethan at the end was going crazy
Ethan got rid of the Superior MAGA Hat and traded it in for a poofter rainbow armband in the poster on his wall. Just shows the 3rd world in his blood.
id definitely go for more zombie content with just vik and behz. maybe josh. maybe not harry
Loved this
Thanks faith!!
I like how Josh and Ethan are playing as a team, and they manage to do everything quite easy and then there is Vik running away from sixty zombies trying to revive Harry who’s dying like every 20 seconds 😂
just realised re-watching this, whats with the CSGO Hud?
whats the game called?
Which game is this?
Which game is this guys?
Can we get some more zombies soon?  There are some cool custom maps in general surely you could find.  Plus this was entertaining to kill time.
whats the name of this game
How far in the video did you realize that KSI is not actually in the video, just his voice was used?
harry is so special
What game is this, it looks like csgo mixed with cod
Lmao Harry just needed Jug, they would tell him once but forget to remind him it ain’t his fault man 😂
Is it mean or the star of this video I thought JJ was in it but it was actually just clips of him talking 😅
What game is this
Enjoyed that so much, best MoreSidemen video in a while. Top quality
Need to upload More of these
What game?
what cod was this on?
what game is this?
Fun game take a shot every time Harry dies! Not so fun coz you would probably have to get your stomachs pumped 😂😂😂
Harry playing on that 60fov😂
that isn,t KSI actually just voice clips of him from his previous videos ......................
omg ethan just upgrade your pc
Ethan laughing at harry will never grow old 😢
ayo sidemen cod zombies is amazing yall should do more of this
Behz the goat 🐐 🫶🏾
harry is the worst at this haha
Well done Ethan 👏bless Harry though ❤  They all did good but them two 😂
Needed Simon in this
Did they just dub jjs voice over the video. That kinda sucks
Loved the Vikk Ethan combo at the end, very wholesome and nice
Honestly surprised how good Ethan was, respect
‘DONT SIIIIIGH!’
we need a vid with all the boys
Poor Faith 😂
not the jj voiceovers lmao
What game are you playing?
Where is the next episode???
Damn “fatneek” being Brutus
Great clickbait thumbnail and title l, I stuck around anyways.
Harry is awful...
I really hate how these guys play with everything on mute....
New Top 10 fastest verses video on my channel😁👍🏽
I hope they know about the mp patch for BO3 cause YouTubers and streamers are getting targeted by tools. Which can mean the modders can make them not be able to play online.
21:00
Where JJ’s voicelines prerecorded I swear mate
What game is this
26:27 2012 Behz activated
what game is this
whtas the game?
Its so funny how shit Harry is at cod
Harry shooting ADS with like 3 sensitivity is hilarious 🤣
i cannot express the joy i feel watching you lot play this
Behz saying zombies shouldn't have guns brings bad memories from vangaurs zombies
Vic and ethan are the vikings
I thought JJ was playing 😂
I want more of this, ITS SO GOOD. Brings back OG days :'''(
More please! :D
I cringed so hard when they said shotguns are poo
S tier performance from Behz 😂
Noahj457 just played this map you guys should play hardcore with Noah and mr waffles it would be sick.
24 minutes of watching this video and i don't know what's happening, cause all i see is ads... about 40-50 ads this far
😡 now i have 2 ads in every 30 seconds,.... pointless being here at youtube, absolutely pointless. Could you start uploading somewhere else please. 🙏
I have had i think 30 ads within 15 minutes of watching this video.... STUPID SHIT
The ads are ridiculous
I enjoy the video a lot (but the ads are ruining the experience for sure, i am frustrated and want to leave youtube asap)
Every minute there is atleast 2x ads... SUCH CRAP IS YOUTUBE
“Shotgun poo” shotguns are the best weapons on zombies that outranks anything else
Wait i was eating mince meat and peas the same time behz was 😂😂😂
The last time at the beginning threw me off
Am i trippin or did that not happen last time
Harry is the worst zombies player I’ve ever seen ngl
I'm 7 minutes in and just realised jide isn't actually playing
Play dead by daylight
I love how they're playing a zombies version of their house shoutout to ice grenade for making the map
Behz shooting straight with the ray gun... >_>
2 legends
Loved this video, more of Vikk and Behz!
Man this is terrible I came to watch Kai just to find out he's not even in the vid
Harry is actually trash lol
Vic with that epic carry!!
Bog w 34 downs 😂😂😂
Ethan looks bad wtf
is this black ops 3 ?
Harry: im gonna stay alive this whole round Also Harry: *dies*
Which cod is this
mate, is that sidemen mansion house
Ksi clout is so strong even the sidemen are using it
Harry wasn’t running wtf bruuhhh 😂😂😂😂
Why are you here? Why are you alive? https://youtu.be/EdCO0BmG6hA
Hey guys I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on a cross and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you believe and repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Please think deeply about this with urgency because this is your eternal life and soul, you don’t know when you could die, meaning you could die at any moment, so please consider this with all your heart. If anyone tells you that Jesus isn’t the only way, they are lying to you and they don’t care about your future. Thx for reading.
5:15 forgot they swear sometimes
Select the game when uploading the video
How can you play this map on your own?
What game even is that
This gives me nostalgic vibes
Behz you will be pleased to know that I was in fact tuned in and saw your top 10 coldest moments
Loved this
shit thought it was hide and seek video
15:50
He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.   (Revelation 2:7)
HaRry had me dying 😂😂😂😂😂 bro like how ????
Been watching Sidemen from the start, years and years, for the first time starting to get tired of the clickbaits and can barely make it past half the video... I feel like they always grew with their audience and now can relate anymore. Shame
what is the name of the game
Shoulda kept Harry out and took JJ. Harry is atrocious at these games lol.
Game?
they should do more zombie videos
Harry my fucking god this guy has gonee downhill drugs did him dirty
Vikk basically babysitting Harry is so funny to me
Ethan's a hero.  Would love to see more of this.  Imagine JJ's reaction to seeing the Fat Neek coming at him.😄
Which game is this?
Ethan at the end was too sick🔥😂
This game is so fucked I'm actually surprised they are playing it together.
where's jj?
I like how they just edited in ksi’s laugh even though he wasn’t in the video lmao
Harry needs to turn that fov up Cant see anything around you at that fov
Harry is hot 🗑
what game is this
i liked the part where ksi was in the video
Harry going down so much makes this video 😂
Loved it. Please sirs can I have some more? 😂
This is probably the best custom map ive seen in zombies in awhile
Need more of these
THIS was really great!
The thumbnail is a banger no lie
harry is so bad that’s what makes it funny 😹
Whats name game
Harry literally doesnt sprint thats the issue 😂😂
Vik and Ethan holding it down
Smashing video this and the first part. More zombies! Or bring back gun game and sticks and stones
Watching Harry play games should be a torture technique, very effective.
we need jj in the next one i wanna see his reaction to himself
And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.   (John 10:28-29) - Jesus Christ is our only Savior. Repent, The Lord Jesus Christ is coming soon.  - Only Jesus Christ is our eternal life. Repent, The LORD Jesus is coming soon.
I got clickbaited so hard 🙄
Changing the title and thumbnail to make people think its a new video is a new low for sidemen
The amount of times vikk said fat neek🙄
why harry scopingall the time
Josh is too good Harry's too shit
Really have to use ksi name and face for views
Ethan looked like he was actually finally enjoying playing a game
Where's the Among us video
watched through the whole vid, so fun!
Please do Vikk Simon Josh Behz
This is a video and a half, loved it
Are they playing CSGO?
a
just simon was missing! tb to “simpler” times
Harry kept standing still and shooting 😂
Should play more of zombies
Loved this
get KSI on this!
Zombies aint for harry guy cant see more than one zombie
Harry always does and it’s so funny
We need more cod zombies from the boys!!! Even 2p was so entertaining to see
Simon planning a wedding, JJ Relaxing, and Tobi doing lord knows what. Harry going to dinner, and Josh being a business man. While Vik and Ethan killing zombies
I thought ksi was actually playing as the character 😂
It just sounds like they have a ksi try not to laugh playing in the background
The disrespect Harry saying mystery crate smh
which game?
Somebody turn Harry's FOV up bro can't see his peripheral 😭😭😭
Which cod is this 🤣🤣
Make more please
Harry revived them and saved them aha

What game is this?
One of my favourite videos

Josh and harry are cowards
where's the first vid tho?
7:04 - Why did Vik say it like that?
Whats the title of the game?
What does fat nek mean?
Was there a part 1 before this?
Sidemen please do another one of these are amazing
i swear JJ isn’t in 90% of the sidemen videos but is in the thumbnail
what the hell is harry’s settings 🤢
Yes Ethan, people are still tuned in
I genuinely thought it was some mod where jj was actually playing 😭😭😭
They should invite syndicate on with them
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
what game is this?
Vik for no reason: CHALLENGE
Ngl click bait made me watch the vid.
*Harry leaves* *loose after 10 minutes* coincidence I think not
What is that game called
Harry yet again the funniest part of the video
LETTSS GOOOO 💯👌 BRAND DEAL VIDEO 😑
God have I missed these
Sidemen x Noahj456 collab 👀
مهسا امینی
#mahsa_amini
Please play this again with jj
What game is this?
Swap Harry out for simon I beg
Ethan a legend🎉
get simon on for next zombies video, have a sweaty af session
I wanna see more
Nice editing with KSI's voice to pretend he was in this video. Can we go back to Josh making all of the ideas? At least he has original ideas.
Do it again with simon instead of bog
Watching Harry trying to play is just aids his sensitivity is on super low and hasn’t got a clue what he’s doing
No one told Harry to pick up the riot shield again smh 😂
that aint ksi thats defoo a recording...
yes ethan. we stayed till the end
need to get all of the sidemen to do this map together
What game is this?
MORE ZOMBIES PLEASE!!!
Vik every 2 seconds - "reckon its time for a challenge boys"
More vids like this please
Hope everyone who sees this has amazing day. 😀
is that the csgo hud?
Harry really was just fkn awful in this.
We need more zombies add Simon in the mix or jj and swap out harry lol these are mad entertaining and brings back the memories
Ethan needs to get better internet it's jarring to watch smooth gameplay and then switch to laggy shit.
immaculate pop off from behz at the end
Can u play 4 men zombie: Josh, Ethan, Vik, Simon.  Like the old days!
We need more of this
i rlly love this content hope they do more of it tbh
43 minute more sidemen. Hell yeah!
lads
Next time get him his perks lol vick smart
Every time Harry got attacked he didn't even move lmao
how do u play custom zombie maps like this?
Harry needs to get it together. First his mid af performance in the football ratings. And his anchor strategy in zombies. Whatchu too busy doing bruv? Don’t stand still in zombies. It’s not that complicated.
you guys should try, :)  -- ninja warrior  -- escape room -- camping / road trip -- paintball  -- dodgeball -- monopoly irl -- army training with Phil as the sargent -- basketball -- strictly come dancing
Behz commentary on Harry's downfall is too funny
Love to play this map
This is a Harry comedy show
If you follow the Bible you will know that most all of the 1,800 prophecies has come to pass. Once the final few happen Jesus Christ will return. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Jesus is the Way the truth and the life. He accepts you no matter where you've been. Doomsday is on the horizon. Believe Jesus is the Son of God. Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord. Read the Bible! Try to repent of your sins. "If anyone is ashamed of Me and My message in these adulterous and sinful days, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when He returns in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.” Our Saviour Jesus Christ died so that we will live. Jesus said, "I'm the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me". We must to believe in our Lord
I’m definitely the Harry of my friends when gaming 😂😂
Does anyone know the background music from 28:45 ? Sounds so freaking EPIC
Fun as always
What game is this?
When's sidemen zombies part2 coming out
Bro ksi ain’t even apart of more sidemen at this rate
Zzz
Give vikk and behz a shoutout to carry out the video man srsly
Please do a just behz and vik game
Vik is the youngest of three brothers but with Harry he definitely gets the taste of being an older brother 😂
We need more that’s was jokes
loved it,
I fucking loved this !!! PLS MORE ! Unedited IDC
Adding the ksi voice snippets are killing me
Ngl I been waiting for zombies for soooo long man, this feels so nostalgic , would love to see the other lads play aswell

https://youtu.be/K4IMzBRKoaA
https://youtu.be/K4IMzBRKoaA
GOD IS GOOD ❤️🙏🏻 GOD loves you ❤️💕
What’s this game?
At first I read it as KSI hunts men
thumbnail changed
fyi the map maker IceGrenade is in the side+ discord and his channel shows him making the map
Crazy Black ops 3 is still this popular
What game is this
NEED PART 3
I wish they finished all the lockdowns. This the type of content that got me into the sidemen. The gaming content never disappoints.
Either clickbait or a violation
cant wait
Drinking game: take a shot every time harry goes down
What is the name of this game
What game is this ? 😂
Which cod is this
Bro Harry dying every second is so annoying i legit can't enjoy the gameplay ffs shoudve just replace Harry with Simon ngl, such wanker.
Someone optimize Behz's PC please, bro is playing on 10 fps
this one is so boring
Clickbait so good
i cant tell if its a cod mod with csgo hud or the other way round
20:57 he's so bad 😭😭😂
Ayyy
If harry had proper headphones instead deez ones then it would’ve been a W
God bless god loves you and your family may he shower his blessings on you and everyone
The thumbnail b4 this one was Mad XD funny tho!
I'd rather have Simon here instead of Harry...
That was a good click bait with ksi in the thumbnail. Sad he isn't in the vid.😔
the black man has his revenge
THANK YOU ALL FOR THE LOVE ON THE MAP…. TOOK MY TEAM AND I A WHILE TO GET IT ON POINT!
I whant ksi and Simon to play this on this channel
I whant ksi and Simon to play this on this channel
Harry is so bad, it's funny, but not really 😂
Jj is not even playing its just the same voice over and over 😭
What’s a “bog”
Shout out faith for the game save❤
This map is too sick!
Another episode please. Especially if it's them succeeding in finishing the map (if this map has an end).
probably the best Sidemen gaming episode I've seen so far
I really enjoyed that hope you guys do more of these
Which COD is this? I'm not familiar to it.
I want to play this game and map
Harry sucks playing zombies
That thumbnail is epic
I've never laughed so much while being so fucking triggered in my life
Would love to see more long form content like zombies!
boring
Has harry never played zombies in his life this dude is always clueless in every game
what is the game called??
Harry before this video  "Im gonna shock the world"
josh casually leaving 😭 HARRY KILLING HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN GRENADE 😭
ngl i kept thinking the turtle was an octane jump pad
Haha click baited
seriously how stupid do u think we r just adding ksi's name to the title n add some of his sound and we will think that he is in the vid come on guys u r the sidemen u don't need to click bait on ksi''s name..
i want to see dead by daylight videos again so bad
yea we still tuned in bhez that was a cold solo fro  you
Banger like always keep it up
Defo wld like to see more zombies vids but actual maps not customs
play dead by daylight PLEASE
you guys need to do another one lmao this was a good video
First Thumbnail better
Now. I am sure Harry has adhd or Asperger's or something. He is incapable of learning quick enough.
is this csgo?
can someone please tell me how many times harry get downed/died
Who else thought jj was in the vid at the start
Wait it says side plus on bottom right? Is there a way for us to play this?
Bro, the sidemen were elite when they made Football videos on "More Sidemen" and not this gaming content!
It’s actually frustrating at how bad harry is
BIG W vik and bez...... <3
ive played this map and the best way to one shot baldksi is to use the thundergun, its OP
What would you eat in a zombie apocalypse? Comment below
" Why must i suffer!" Is such a Cod zombie sound idk why
Need more
We want more of these!!
what game is even this
We want a lot more of these coming please. Really good content. Going back to the roots is what was needed.
43:26 I am certainly tuned in. The match got tense till the end!
What game is that? It looks like csgo or cod
nah when you go down in late rounds and lose all your perks it is a nightmare, what harry is doing is something entirely different 🤣
i feel like harry is that friend you had that always darth vadars the mic when playing, but just is unable to focus on more then 1 thing at a time, yet they sound so locked in, i mean i guess harry isnt anymore, cause hes not into games nowadays, but he definitely was that guy
nah who changed the thumbnail, the one before was way better
This brings me back to the old days. I'd love to see more cod zombies from these guys.
A solid sidemen more video
This is so dead and boring....
What game is this ???
Big up Vikk & Bhez for the extra content😇
Harry is god awful at games 😭
Harry as soon as he gets hit just stands still bro
I remember when they used to play back in the day and i used to watch them as a kid. This bought back so many memories and i hope they keep doing it.
We need Simon Ethan josh and vik to play this map together
Why you guys keep shooting the black guy?
Harry must play on the slowest sens 🙈
You guys have to play this with JJ
Do the Easter egg
Gotta do more zombies vids
If this video was 10 hours Long I Think I would've still watched it.
10/10 vid do more plz
this  sooo entertaining
Harry makes me laugh😂😂
Harry built different😂
https://youtu.be/rV8y56Ddrbs
it actually blows my mind how bad harry is xD he has no game awareness at all, its both hilarious and infuriating at the same time
Been waiting for this 😍
Aint nobody talking bout how this is literally cod and csgo mixed into eachother?
"Don't Sigh Check The Tape" - Harry
He’s not happy for u he’s jus saying that 💀
Probably not be able to play for long due to all the hackers making bo3 impossible to play multiplayer
HELL YEA ANOTHER ONE 🔥🔥
This was such a class video, made me crease so much! Would love to see another play through of it, defo have Ethan Vik and Josh 😂😂😂 (sorry Harry)
Finally zombies content !!!!!
Top vid please upload more wtih more sidemen please
Ethan held it together near the end holy shit
Why play with Harry😂😂makes it so painful to watch
Harry MVP of the vid 🤣🤣🤣🤣
lol ethan the carry
We need to see another crack with simon instead of harry, i wanna see this map completed
Need double tap
Vik behz josh and simon would be a great team for this map I believe
please more of this with the rest of the boys (harry we get it if you busy tho 😂
Watching Harry is actually painful
Which game is it?
Hopefully they keep playing Zombies as this is bringing back nostalgic memories man...
It's actually a skill to be bad as W2S at games.
We need to see the boys beat this map
This was honestly better than any of the recent sidemen sundays
part 2
❤️
Is this black ops 3 custom zombies ?
Has been á long time, right? I was missing your amazing cartoons... 😍😍
What game is this
Amazing video . Need to do more
I feel for harry. If you don't know the strats it can be frustrating. Like the basic sprint in a circle and line them up and repeat harry didn't get. Harry tried to stand his ground and shoot to much, Don't think he realized how it should be played. Also once he spawned with that shit mp5 it's game over for him every time. Harry's the type of guy who needs to be shown how to play not told haha. Everyone learns different
which game is this
Then end was legendary 😂😂❤
u gotta do one more of this
w2s liability gaming
Sidemen need to make this as an actual game. Looks sick
Harry is just bad at every game he plays xD his brain works on 2 fps
the fact that Harry's FOV is much lower than everyone elses, implying he probably doesnt even know about the FOV slider is such classic Harry
boring sidemen now
This is one of my favorite MoreSidemen video of all time. Behz and Vikk were really cold with it.
I really enjoyed this, wouldn't mind if you guys did this more on moresidemen
Why does this have the CSGO hud though lol
harry has like negative sens
harry is a gaming youtuber but he suck at games 😂
This needs to become a series
Would love to see more custom zombies maps with the sidemen like the old days!!
Seeing harry play so bad is hard to watch
36:26 Harry reviving Zerkaa wa hilarious
More of this please, prefer watching you on it than playing 😂
I dont appreciate the clickbaits on moresidemen 😭
The only person who goes down more than Harry is Austin McBroom
Why not get Tobi or Simon over professional cod player Harry?
Old school vibes
Harry is dreadful
watched to the very end <3
Well that was boring😐
So nice that they kinda know what they doing, makes it so much more watchable
I'd love to see them do something like cheese cube lmao this is a tough map but compared to like cheese cube lmao
All i see is zombie sidemen fans trying to get a picture with the sidemen back in the old house lol
What game is this? Looks like black ops zombies but what version?
42:35 still hear
Harry Thankyou for your sacrifice for the content
i could have this on the fckn main channel tho, this was peak
I'm high as shit I was so confused, I thought KSI was really controlling the warden lmao
Old behz vibes
Legend knows they changed the thumbnail
Need more zombies
surely swap harry for simon
absolutely love the throwback of zombies gameplay and would love more of it!!!
Bro they still using ksi for views and he ain’t even here 😂
The return of the Fat Neek
24:00
harrys just ass at zombies man😂
I loved how they kept playing after Josh and Harry left
Please do more cod custom maps, it's really fun to watch you guys play
what game is this?
HahahahahahahahahahhahahahahaahhahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahaahhahahhahahhahahahahahahahahhaahhaahahhahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahhahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahahahhahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahhahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahhahahhahahahhahhahahahhahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahhaahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahhahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahhahahahhahahhahahahhahhahahahahahhahhhahahaahhahahhahahhahahahhahhahahahhahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahahahhahahhahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahahhahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahaahhahahhahahahhahahahhahahahhahhahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahaahahahhahhahahahahahhahahhahahhahahahhahahhahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahHhHHhahahahhahahahhahahahhahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahhahahhahahahahhahahhahahahahhahahahahhahahhahahahhahahhahahhahhahahahhahahhhhahaahhaahhahahahaahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahhahaahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahahahaahhahahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahhahahaha
the jj audio was really offputting whoever edited this was on some shit
Hear me out, zombies is all about survival so in my books, Harry>>>Josh
The work in progress thumbnails slap, they should keep some sometimes 😂
If they just camp the balcony theyll be fine
I need this again !!!
This video perfectly describes zombies with the boys back in the day.  Vik & Ethan are the 2 pros who know everything about the game, Josh is the one who hypes up playing only to leave early & Harry is the noob who is 99% enthusiastic 1% Zombie skills. 😂
Harry literally stands still and shoots and dies bruh
Behz and vik gotta run that back as a duo
What’s the name off the play you game
If josh hadn't left they would have easily reached 30 and completed all lockdowns.   Also harry getting downed every 5 sec man 😂
Harry having 34 downs in the end had me dying
Now i can say harry needs to go on a hike.
Half those weapons yall got were from infinite warfare...goated cod game looking back..it had a top 5 cod campaign, great party game modes and alot of fun weapons.
Josh (zerka)=L mans
Loved the sticking it out, much appreciated
We needed Simon here
Right lads lets make the game extra hard by rezzing harry every minute😂
6:13 Vik💀💀
Omg harry
Cold vid🥶🥶
Come on guys call me for the videos I want to be on it come one Josh Ksi Toby
Come on guys call me for the videos I want to be on it come one Josh Ksi Toby
I hope they finish all the lockdowns. its been very fun so far <3
So uh when’s jj coming back actually you all are the fkn best but it’s not the same without all of you together feels like a family member died
They should get Simon instead of Harry next time lmfao
12 hours late
harry's field of view is awful
Need an OG session with Vik, Ethan, Josh and Simon. The GOATed days
Ethan casually pulling the best gun in bo4 saying it’s shite
What game is this
The JJ laughs sound like he's in the call lmao
Don’t let harry in cod again
We want one more with the same team pls
It took my dumbass way too fucking long to realize KSI wasn’t actually in the video 🤦🏼‍♂️
When you think Ethan and vik might actually not get along… then this video reminds you oh yeah they making way too much money for that to matter😂
i left before it fineshed kept my PC loaded and came back and said fuck ill finish it my gosh ethan u r fucking cracked
Gg Ethan!
Harry is utterly useless🤣
Respect for Behz and Vik just went up. Warriors.
Harry might be the worst gamer I’ve ever seen Jesus Christ
MORE ZOMBIES
When ya hear JJ's laugh sounds like his with the lads in the stream but actually its the game 🤦🏼‍♂️😅
I am dead - Harry Lewis 2022
Who else thought jj was in the vid, props to the editor
Watching harry stink at zombies is what i needed today.
Run it backkkkk
Give us more custom zombies content!!!
i could watch a looong series of this
Ethan carried and went ultra instinct big W
That was siiick.  Behz and Vik at the end was epic!!
title and thumbnail seems to have changed since last night lol
Vik and Behz great momets
For how long do you guys are gonna get views in the name of KSI ? Are you guys are nothing without him ? Like what? Do people not watch the videos if he's not in it ? When asked in interviews you guys say we all are equal !! That's not clearly the case ! You guys put his face on thumbnails of videos even in those in which is not there so what does that implying ? The day he's done with Sidemen it'll fell apart only because of him ! Nothing will be changed if anyone else leaves but JJ! I'm a Sidemen fan for very long but it's been a disappointment lately !
Can we play this map
Banger, savoury mince dinner
Save Harry
They really should have got Simon on for this.
MOREEEEE PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE THE FANS WANT ITTTTTTTTTT ADD SIMON TOO OG TEAM T.T
bro i love this
I’m here the last hour, let me experience an more sidemen video
Ksi his laugh and hunting game is perfect match up ngl
Definitely more of these!
Yes we are still tuned in. Always will be tuned in :)
I would’ve never watched anything like this if it wasn’t on the sidemen channel
They need to do this with Simon instead Of Harry
More vik and bez gaming together plz😘
Harry 64 year old man should start hiking and stop playing games..
What does Harry do on his off time, he is so bad at video games.
If you told Harry to just never stop moving it might have helped.
What is that game?
Bout to smoke a blunt then watch this
guys be real help harry out then atleast around the house nice one josh and then harry said im gonna stay alive for this next round ot a chance, without juggernaut.. hahahahaha and just help him every time he asks a question so what do i do now you say go pack and punch no way just grab to wall guns and jugg and run in circles and get a train zerka nows how to do that. so why not put zerkaa with harry then, ? cuz he help him with getting the gun at around  19:00 min and like 20 seconds later hes down again ofcourse cuz he didnt had juggernaut cmon guysbe a family help a brother out, not his fault he don't know the lay out and is like bad in every game execpt mario kart. xd again 20:40 time down but he has the money to buy jugg but nobody gides him too that place xd big upss too vik and ethan
this was a movie!!! loved it
Why did they change the thumbnail?
This must be the most time Behz has been concentrated in a Sidemen video in a long time
What black ops is this, 2?
Love Harry but we need Simon
42:30 "are people still tuned in?" yes mate
Bhez the GOAT🔥
I can see the delay on harrys screen i know that fucks with him
“Is there any point in reviving him” Jesus you know it’s bad when Vik starts to roast you lmao
loved this longer video it really was a throw back to the older days of gaming. Definitely should do more of them. Cheers lads
Wish I could play this on black ops 4 real game this is way better
What the name of the game ?
Thank you, guys, for always being there, literally fighting back tears rn hope this helps
Genuinely reckon if it’s vik Simon/tobi josh and Behz they win
26:25
Josh still ended up with most headshots 🤣
Moreeeeee pleaseeeeee
Moreeeeeeee
You can tell Harry was never a cod baby unlike the rest of them😂
Where is ksi
Nice video
Behz has always been a G at zombies 🙌🏾
Ethan is my GOAT !!!!!!!
I want to see a part 2
19:27 Harry saying he's gonna stay alive the whole round and then getting down is jokes 😂😂💀
It's always Ethan and his bad connection 😂😂
Vik and Ethan know the vibes, We ride together we die together Cod bros👍
Wtf no game sound. Mad weird
Banger vid😊
which cod is this please?
Josh let the boys down
Please make more
Welcome to a new episode of sidemen trying to get KSI in the title and the thumbnail
Want this map
bogs fov infuriates me
Thought we were gonna get a dead by daylight I got hyped
Guys c'mon we're better than this
Harry's problem is he just has no spatial awareness.
Lmao poor Harry man, he's struggling so bad
:)
We were close to breaking the record, but alas unfortunate
Vik and ethan trying their best till the end was so wholesome ❤❤😂
It's actually amazing how harry managed to be shit at most games they play😂
Harry actually sucks at every game the sidemen play 😂 Makes for ridiculous clips loool
What’s the first one called ?
😂❤️‍🔥
Vik getting techy with it
Definitely thought KSI was playing for the first 5 mins
Faith the goat
Blimey you lot really want to take your fans' money
Og sidemen together
theres so combination of 2 sdmn that is not enjoyable
The thumbnail changed
We need zombies back!!! PLEASEEEEE
Seeing behz carry was cold 🥶
Hearing JJ’s laugh makes me miss him more… Fitneek, enjoy your tour and vacation!🥰
Aww... Kinda like the last thumbnail better :/
43 minutes of sidemen cod zombies.... did I step into a time machine?? The good old days!!
2 grown man pulling a " My mom said it's dinner time"💀moment in the middle of this absolute Gigachad classic session. Well done boys holy. Have a good one everyone and be safe. 😊♥It better have been an exquisite dinner I'll say!😡😂
Loooooooooool. im still tuned in.
This is one of my favourite more sidemen videos of all time.
These bots in the replies are so boring
What game is this
What game is this
Harry’s like the little brother lmao
What game is this?
I'm suprised how their game didn't just randomly turns off because of the hackers in the BO3 servers
Behz buys million dollar home. Also behz bOyS Immm lagGinG
When Ethan gets a b23r and doesn’t even know the potential he’s holding
FLATNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK
The fatneeks reminds of south park when stan had a giant clone
It's funny that the whole time harry only bought 1 helpful perk 😁😂
The KSI soundboard 😭😭😭😭
what game is this?
Hope they play more. Need to add Simon instead of harry and all boys be committed the whole time and not leave
Reminds me of The good ol days
https://youtu.be/soWM9SQAzrg?t=2542 yes
Faith unplugging behz's ethernet cable so he'd eat with her 😂
fuck me the clutch coming in from harry with the hilarious revive going for josh first lmao xd
Should definitely do this again but don't let Harry play with you as he kept going down here was your weakness
When you're checking the comments to see if JJ is actually playing or not...
Y’all should play dead by daylight
NDL
it took me 2mins to realize that JJ wasn't actually playing....lol
Watching Harry was so enfuriating, he was absolutely hopeless
I feel bad for harry in this vid
Harry throughout the video "F*ck Off"
Would love to see more of these!
Anyone else really wanna play this beg they make it public
Does Harry realize there are perks?
Sheesh more behz and vik zombies
What game is
what game is this?
Poor harry was downed every minute😂
Yo not gunna lie I’d love to see more of the boys doing zombies cause this is sick
Vik: Ola-cheesecake  HAHAHHAHA
MORE LONG GAMEPLAY❗️❗️
They need to make the teddy bear from the mystery box look like Bearus
The Fatneek is just amazing 👏 🤣🤣 top tier content 👌
Even when JJ isn’t here he still finds a way to bully Vikk smh
Made my day seeing Behz properly into a game finally, love it
AHH NOOOO, why did the thumbnail change? LOL
Ethan popped off at the end
Where is the original video ? The first part ?
we need more of this please
#devyneedsmentoday2022bakalivesmatternotblacklivesmatter
Do it again without Harry
this was poor by harry lol
Someone please tell Harry to change his fov because it looks like his looking through a magnifing glass or sth and can"t see anything around him  And i feel like he plays like this any game you play xd  Tbh it probably makes the whatching expirence better and worse at the same time
i love the sidemen and cod. love to see them playing it
I’m bare confused when I hear JJ laughing thinking he’s playing as well😅
sick!!!!!!!!!
More of these!
No offense but don't invite harry to these types of games he ruins the whole thing it was funny the first couple times after that I would have honestly kicked him
Not Harry reviving the already dead Josh 😭
Great Video, loved it
Death. Taxes. W2S being down every round
omg it took me ages to realise ksi wasn't in the video i thought that was him at the start and not the game
How is Harry so bad
Naaa how has harry made a living playing games when he’s just the worst gamer ever😂😂
What a video! Welcome 40+ minutes any day
Ethan is a legend for the ending
I LOVE THISSSS
Ethan and Vik thank you for this golden content
Yoo u lot should do more among us videos
This is so sick. Surely they do another
Harry in the kitchen with all of the revives was actually top tier 😭😂🤣 they can say whatever they want but as soon as he left the team dropped
lets go needed the 2nd episode
🔥
vik and behz the duo we never new we needed
What is the name of this game
I thought that the laugh was ksi's real laugh
This has to become a series. That was fantastic.
Moooooore
Good to see KSI on as a guest
🔥🔥🔥🔥
DO NOT PLAY COD 3 ZOMBIES ANYMORE IF YOU WANT TO STAY SAFE. THE GAME HAS BEEN INVADED BY HACKERS WHERE IF YOU JOIN ANY ONLINE SERVER THEY CAN GRAB YOUR IP AND CORRUPT BOTH YOUR GAME AND PC FILES/ SENSITIVE DATA. IT IS ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS FOR CONTENT CREATORS WHERE THE HACKERS WANT TO GAIN ATTENTION. MORE ON THIS ON LEXIFYS CHANNEL. PLEASE READ THIS AND BE AWARE THAT THE GAME IS NOT SAFE
Garry's mod TTT, hide n seek etc would be a right laugh.
Bo1 zombies
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg559JEL9e4
You changed the thumbnail
Do this, but the opposite and in London starting a quarter mile away from him
Wat game is this
Harry is just BAD, little bro doesn't have the chromosomes for gaming
The previous thumbnail was funnier
I wanna know what happens when they activate boxing ring
Yeah I’m still tuned in  Ethan come on!!
Always get clickbated
little did they know that the final boss in this game is harry
Is jj ever going to return to the sidemen or what
As a zombie veteran ive seen people like Harry who allways running around in crowded places, get stuck in corners, trying to knife a zombie at lvl 19, have 34 downs! But I have never seen someone revive a AFK before every one else and then try to rivive the non AFK and then stop half way through to then start revive another player 😂
best duo sidemen video in a minute sheesh
need this again but with Simon
Release this as a free to play with buy able in game content would slap .
i need  this in real life
We need Simon,Behz,Vikk and Josh running this map old school on the 2nd channels
It’s the most JJ has appeared in a video 😂
Even watching this harry was starting to annoy me how absolutely crap he is
Lmao love that fatneek 😂🔥 It's funny to see Harry died multiple times 😂
Bog is shit now because he went on too many hikes 😂😂
I love how much effort went into the sound design of this map and all the custom guns just for the editors to mute the gameplay
wow!
og thubnail >
what is this game
Bro when Harry revived josh 😂😂
Imagine your KD being under 10 after 20 rounds of zombies 🤣🤣
I gotta say, this zombies game shows just how old we are now. This zombies game is awesome. I hope the other half of the sidemen will play a game like this again. Just like the old days.......
Unbelievable clickbait dead video
thumbnail change?
Harry wants using his second gun
Tobi Simon and JJ need to play this. Ethan the goat holding the team down
I like how clueless ethan is after getting the helion
vikk, josh, behz and simon should stream from this channel playing this map. This videos are soo dope, giving old school vibes
I need moreee
Just came to say icegrenade is a legend
Harry got downed 34 times 🤣
How do I play this map
We want the other half to try it!
MLG Harry!
Who let harry play zombies 😂
Harry reviving zerkka when ethan and vikk are both down is the most harry moment🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Anyone else see the first thumbnail lol
felt bad not liking the video after this lot put themselves through that. fair play to them lmao
43MINSS??? FUCK YES
All in favour of sidemen play doors on roblox?
Is this a created game lobby? Like customised ? Cuz what cod is this
Honestly one of the most enjoying moresidemen gaming vids, more like this please
Sidemen needs to do cheese cube v5
Harry has 0% headshots and like 60% of the time shoots the grippers
Harry frustrated me for at least 25mins
great title
This video was very interesting, I didn’t even realize it was 40+ minutes!
clickbaited again thanks sidemen
Harry with a light 34 downs 😂😂😂
Harry, No jug, no perks just vibes
I thought it was slasher😔
New game.... have a shot every time Harry goes down??
Makes me feel sick on how shit they are at zombies and don't know what perks are and which guns are good and bad
took me 2mins to realise that ksi isn't playing as the zombie...
I wanna see the Sidemen play the Cheese cube challenge maps!
I love this so much
Harry: I'm going to stay alive this entire round boys.  *10 seconds later* Harry: Fuck off
This was so funny, the Harry moments, Ethan's internet issues, Josh's dinner. I genuinely laughed and enjoyed this so much! You have to do this again!!
I beg y’all do blacks ops 2 zombies
we need more of this! honestly quality seeing the boys back on cod zombies
Simon planning a wedding, JJ Relaxing, and Tobi doing lord knows what. Harry going to dinner, and Josh being a business man. While Vik and Ethan killing zombies
falling for these clickbait’s
# number1 on trending
I would love to see Vik Josh Ethan and Simon do this map like all the created maps they did years ago
I love sidemen but stop with this click  bait shit … using ksi… just don’t lose subscribers
Harry on the Xbox 360, omegalul
We need completion stream
My favourite part was vik repeating its free and Harry continues saying he doesn't have enough money. I was just dying 😂😂😂
I'm convinced JJ isn't even in the video and they edited his sound bytes instead
Harry is terrible at cod lol
I don’t know what goes down more Ethan’s internet or harry
how many ads you gon put on this shit bro
Drop this mod
Don't worry Ethan, we watching 😂😂
Harry going down constantly is literally me playing Zombies. I never really got it as a kid, and it just never appealed to me. Felt so complicated with Easter Eggs and whatnot
Best vid😂🎉🎉🎉
A zombies series would be so good!
I was laughing the entire video
Sick!!
Why aren’t we allowed to hear the game
Click bait cause no KSI 👀
ive been waiting for thissss !!
Ethan was insane
"There's a fatneek in the kitchen!" Love it from vikkstar lol
i want to know where to download this game
We need more of these
Anyone notice thumbnail change?
Dw Ethan we were all tuned in till the last
Why is jj’s voice in the video but he’s not even part of it
lowkey sad how they even use ksi in titles when he isn't there
42:30 I'm still tuned in behz u goat
i reckon the fat neek appears way too often, i think it should appear every 5 rounds or so like dogs in the original zombies
Which COD game is this?
I would love to see more old school gaming content from you lot and it seems the gamers in the group enjoy the throwbacks too.
Why'd they change the thumbnail
Ugh clickbait.
Anyone else notice they changed the thumbnail? Personally I thought the original one was better 🤔
harry's brain works differently holy
Vikk and Behz satisfying their inner teenage selves for an hour we love to see it
Please do this again 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 this is your best video on this channel in my own opinion ❤️
Harry with 34 downs🤣
Harry playing on like 13 fov makes me once again realise that there are so many reasons beyond his actual skill level as to why he is just so fucking dogshit at gaming lol
What game is this?
This is exactly what I needed to make my week much better, a 40 min zombies video from the sidemen
Why has the thumbnail changed 😂
how many times has this thumbnail changed
i didnt even know this was the zombies continuation, almost didnt click
Behz was actually so good
Josh and Vik really are my zombie goats
These fuckers got to be the best clickbaiters lmao
Clocked the title/thumbnail change.
Harry is so shit but i love it
the random jj voice lines actually killing me here wathcing this, OH MY FUCKING GOD, for sidemen sundays you all should have a soundboard foreach of yous with all your best lines
Anyone else think JJ was actually playing at first😐
Why is harry so shit and every single game but not Mario Kart fk me
Dead by daylight 5 video
Finally!! The Goats Always Surprise us with the best content ❤
26:03 the flip the zombie does has me weak 😂😂
why are they always changing the thumbnail
Baiting us into thinking JJ is back...
Harry is making me angry 😭😭 Bro Just dont Shove your self in zombies ass Evertime he just stands infront of 30 zombies Everyone realize it after 2 3 deaths Bro is Still doing the same shit 💀💀💀💀
Fun fact: Harry went down 34 times out of a 94 minute game, he was killed once every 2.7 minutes… pain
harry is GARB😂
When you are so early to the vid drops that you see the original thumbnail. Anybody else enjoy when you see the thumbnails change?
When Behz died at the end I was so sad
harry mate turn your sense up and you might actually be able to move around obsitcals better, jou plonker.
They changed the thumb nail lmaooo
Bro I'm tripping, I was like "JJ get em!" Thinking he was playing the whole time 😭😭😭
Every single second worth watching
Lmao anyone else notice they changed the thumbnail
Hello
How many times is the thumbnail gunna change
Take a shot every time Harry says "Oh no I'm dead" 😂😂
Why was the thumbnail changed
We need more ethan and vikk content
Ethan was actually so cold at the end
Ksi sound bits is a nice touch
Harry needs to learn that perks help
why did they change the thumbnail?
Finally
Prefer videos like this lads well done
Respectfully I need more
4750🤌🏼🤌🏼
Excited to see JJ back in the Sidemen content soon🙏🙏🙏
The old thumbnail got blipped by Thanos
Love how they're the typical squad: Leader ==> Vikk Sweaty player ==> Josh Behz: Player with shit internet ==> Behz Noob ==> Harry 😭😭😭😭😭
Jj wasn’t playing lol just his laugh 😂
We need them back on the OG WAW map!
i bete this is an on ph hub man 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Love this
The title in the video and outside the video are opposite meanings 😢
42:26 Yes Behz, we are still tuned in.
Do another episode with vik josh ethan and simon sidemen zombie custom map please, i really missed simon in zombie custom map
Replace Harry with Simon and this becomes a real series.
What is this game, HUD looks exactly like CSGO, but movement and whole thing doesn:t look any similar
Harry is such an NPC when playing games 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Harry with 300 kills 😂😂😂
Really thought the were back Playing Dead by Daylight
"are people still tuned in?" absolutely, and id love to see more sidemen zombies!!
42:24 yes Ethan were fucking tuned in all the old cod lads with ya
Really hope you guys do more videos on this map. So good! Maybe replace harry with Simon tho😂😂😂
35:09 LMFAOO poor Harry
Just seen another person complete the game on round 22 in 40 mins... you guys should try it again to complete it :)
I was the Harry of my friend group I was constantly getting downed every round
Harry not know what a FOV slider is?
harry shit at every game.........................how?!
Is that KSI laugh in game or edited?
Yes Ethan, I'm still tuned in, fucking heroic mate
LETSS GOOO
What the name of the game
This really captures the WAW/BO1 zombies with your boys feel. It has everything, Connection interrupted, friend going down, running around like headless chickens.   Absolute classic.
ksi soundboard?
Looks like viks nose comes with his glasses
This is such a good video that I’d love for these guys to play left 4 dead, that would be amazing,
Why do we here ksi lauching but hes not in the vid
changed thge thumbnail
This is so legendary
robocop> manglers
The shoutout the syndicate’s rape train was amazing ahahaha
What COD is this
No one JJ the hole 43min  "hahaha haha haahahaaaa"
not just syndicate who called it a rape train, im pretty sure most people use to call it that back in the day, when the world wasn't full of snowflakes and take offence at everything
They need to do another one of these but this time Simon is in the team instead of Harry
More of these please
Among us next please🙏
This brought back memories
Need more videos like this. Miss the cod days.  MW2???
Love this video, blast to the past
Whoever made this is a genius  Props to whoever did this Geeeezzzz
I WAS THERE TILL TOP 5 COLDEST MOMENTS
Year how many of Behz having shit internet?😭
It took me 5 minutes to realize JJ wasn’t there 😂. Big ups the editor
MORE OF THESE PLZ
please more of these .
Ethan went crazy at the end well done 😂🤙
These modded zombies videos are sick
I feel like we need Vik, Josh, Ethan and Simon to do the next one
Harry trying to knife them at round 16...
Ogs know the title is changed
Stop click baiting jj
Thumb nail change...
Make the whole sidemen play this zombie map to see how far they get it will be jokes
Goddamn it harry !
First thumbnail was better
Anyone notice the title and thumbnail change?
play it again and Sub harry for Simon. We need to see all the challenges completed.
Stop click baiting. Ur past it u old cogers
Vik is the worst person here to help harry
The clickbait title got me 🤦🏻‍♂️
Behz and Vik GOATED
Did they add the JJ noises or does the map have it like that lol im assuming sidemen added it lol thats why there not laughing at the noises lol
Big ups to Vik for saving Harry every fucking time
Hm
I love how its just audio clips of JJ 😂😂
really thought vikkstar or josh were gonna carry but big up behzy-boo
I’m the Harry when playing COD, the pain 😂
Well this time thumbnail changes not title
honestly I'd watch more zombies of just behz and vik
It probably took more time finding all the ksi quotes than editing the whole video itself
Harry's the first person i've seen get a negative KD in zombies.
Yesss Ethannn!!!! We watching you smoke those zombies 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
Why is the quality of this video so bad ? Can see the pixels 🤣🤣
Do these guys just change thumbnails every couple hours or is it a way to click on the video again because u think it’s a different video
Vik you need your mule “KICK”
I'm still tuned in. I'm all for it for behz and Vik
What was the final level they go to?
Fun drinking game : drink everytime Harry goes down
Harry sounding like a soundboard everytime he’s pissed😂
w2s is actually shit at gaming🤣
*Please Do More Of This! Ethan & Vikk actually know how to play and the rest suffering is funny asf!!*
Anyone catch the original thumbnail?
8:10
Last video I commented “Harry’s surprisingly good at zombies” I take it all back 😂😂😂
I dont care anymore this is way better than some sidemen sunday, im a big fan of the map
Someone didn't like the first thumbnail and changed it
Someone please buy Ethan a new pc lmao
Changed thumbnail?🤔
Stop click baiting
This was worth the 6 day wait
what game
Would love to see mrdalek play this map.
Who was here before the new thumbnail?
We need more of this but we need Simon playing tooo🤣
This was actually such a great watch. I’d rather see them play games that they genuinely enjoy rather than what’s trending. Much better content imo
@Sidemen I am commenting it second time, please get harry a new Capture and Graphics card. Pretty please :)
FINALLY, THE OTHER PART OF THE VIDEO IS OUT, ive been looking forward to this
Long
Man the nostalgia
Maan seriously your guys thumbnail changes are clever to get viewers twice GG  BUT NOT NEXT TIME🤗🤗
What was the point of the video preview 😂😂
More zombies
Yes we are still here watching mad behz
Ethan, Tom/ syndicate referred  it as a rape train not a tape train
Please bring back zombies regularly, revisit kino pleaseeeeeeeee
legends know they changed the picture 📸
We need more zombies gameplay 😩🙏
42:24  yes! 🥤😐🍿
More zombies please
WHERE IS THE DOWNLOAD LINK???
Thumbnail change?
I fking loved these 2 vids, COD zombies with you lot really brought back some nosatlgic vibes. Can we get a Vikk, Ethan, Simon, Josh vid and see how long it goes for. Would be an amazing vid
Less go
im sorry but you need to complete this map! same crew, no dinner, no jammy internet. just og sidemen gaming
sidemen are cucks for KSI
Harry - the king of standing still in zombies
Harry: I'm going to survive the whole round. Proceeds to die immediately
Thumbnail change
why you changing the thumbnail
damn the thumbnail change actually made me click on it more than the previous one. big ups
Can someone count how many times harry went down🤣???
I had tears in my eyes from seeing Harry revive josh
Sdmn rocket league
What happened to the earlier thumbnail
I thought jj was playing for so long
COD with CSGO hud?
Thank you again for this amazing opportunity to make this map for you guys! looking forward to working with you guys again! 😁
Imma say this and I want yall to stay calm: this was better than the Sudemen Sunday, In sorry. They're both good but important this was better
Yo
Moment of silence for everyone who really thought it was JJ.
We need more of this from the sidemen.  Not the long wait for a new upload but playing different games like horrors and other games
What's the game called?
You guys need to swap Harry for Simon and I bet you guys could be the map if it’s possible
How many times did vik revive Harry in this video
I couldn’t stand playin wit Harry😂😂
Sidemen bringing out a game ???
I have been trying to get to 300 subscribers for a while now I'm currently at 250 I post TV Clips but I really wanna get 1K so tell me what video you want to see and I will do it it can be any type of video, Music video, gaming anything I can't sing tho.
It's both funny and frustrating watching Harry constantly put himself in the perfect situation to die.
So we need these videos weekly, how many likes to do it again please?
hi
I’m really surprised how realistic JJ’s skin in cod zombies is. It looks hella like irl.
welcome back JJ!!!!
This game reminds me when fortnite was good and so many people played save the world
Best map creator ever #IceGrenade on  YouTube made this!! Check out all there insane maps and shenanigans!!!  https://youtube.com/c/IceGrenade
get syndicate to jump in one of these vids and do some more custom zombies
ayyyy
might just be me but the fact harry is so unbelievably stupid is pissing me off, idk
Bro Ethan losing connection during the end killed me 😭
I’ve never seen someone be so immobile in a zombies game, lol. Harry just stands there and aims at the zombies legs,😂
The best video I have ever watched . 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🧟🧟‍♀️🧟‍♂️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
42:24 I can confirm we are still very much tuned in
Harry gotta fix his fov😭
they're all hating on harry but be clutched it for them in the kitchen when they all went down, even if he did revive the only afk player first
Can’t believe how baaad harry is 🤣🤣🤣
Harry going down every 30 seconds made me laugh way more than it probably should have
Harry is so bad at Zombies 😂
it was actually a great video
Damn me and pewpewinyoface completed this map easy
2:02 Josh and his mum on the screen together
Is this call of duty????
burh i wanna play that game
Ksi skipping speed
Everyone has a “Harry” in their squad
I like at the end vik said tousands
I dont think ive seen anyone worse than harry no wonder he never used to play back in the days😂😂😂
Should’ve got Simon in for harry
Yo big up vik and Ethan for the W
Wow this map is impressive 🤯👏🏻
BANGER
Try playing cold war zombies it will be Easter for Harry
.
This is better than last weeks sidemen Sunday
Harry's FOV is so bad lmao, no wonder he keeps dying
you need to do it again
37:45 what harry needs to do
Love this video
Harry is struggling we’ve all had one of those games. Rough
Harry's FOV makes me irrationally angry
I’m a bit like Harry in cod my mum didn’t let me have guns when I was younger so I couldn’t play cod either my first ever one was Cold War all my mates are getting positive easily whilst I’m getting like 0.75 every game 😭
Jj is back to bulking season in the thumbnail
Round 2 with everyone?😂
Vikk: The smart and calm big brother Ethan : The angry strict big brother Harry: Absolutely chaotic little brother Josh: The COD Dad
is jj okay? i kinda miss him in the sidemen videos.
I love the different audio they used for baldski/fatneek.
Behz yelling at the misses to stop watching TV killed me 🤣
I love the fact that harry knows the house layout so they can call out a location "cinema room" and harry isn't just like "where the f is that boi's"
Harry not buying perks is so funny yet so infuriating.
Imagine all the sidemen playing this
we need more of this content
Ethan the goat. We need more videos from this!
Get Simon instead of Harry plss
Harry is so bad lmao
if they turn this into a series we need a comp of harry falling down
Vikk is in his element, love to see it.
I don't think it's a bad thing that Harry can't play any video games well
I have wanted this since 2 mintues into that last one.
I’m so happy these lot are coming back to zombies. it’s so fun watching them try hard so much😂
Ice grenade is the goat for this one
I LOVE ZOMBIES, always been my favorite sidemen content
Extreme Shooting with Friends! 🔥 https://youtu.be/WSNKeXoxg_w
This was sick!!!!!!
Hahah i fking love this content🤣 please do more if can make all sidemen when available 🤣 harryfan4L
they also used to do this in the middle ages
Shotguns are the best in zombies especially when pack a punched they’re elite
I want more cod zombies from the Sidemen
hi
Harry just like me for real
sick
:)
This is amazing pls do another one
Sidemen react to “don’t hug me I’m scared” on YouTube I would love that
bro the ksi sound effects when the fat neek came sent me every time 😭
Just saying we will never see custom bo3 zombies from sidemen again as on bo3 pc there is a client which can s Ddos people and force their game to quit search it up. I mean  custom Waw zombies is a option.
Ethan: I’m stronger, I’m smarter…I’M BETTER.. I AM BETTER!!!!!
Love to see bio josh Simon and Ethan all sweat it out
from 4 people to behz going out like a fucking GIGACHAD…what a round of cod zombies🤣🤣
I like that, since it's their old house, they all automatically know the callouts for each location except from Harry
is this CSGO? And can you get the map?
Harry youre my fav sidemen.... but lad.. you're terrible here 🙈
I wanna see y’all actually finish it but maybe have Ksi play
This was fucking elite
Among us?
LOVE THE ZOMBIES CONTENT! KEEP EM COMIN'!!
Does beta squad live here now?
What was funny about a dog in the room ?
It’s about time
Vik: we got 3 robo cops in the back garden.  Manglers: am I a joke to you
They gotta tell harry the knife doesn’t work round 17 😂😂😂
I feel so sorry for Harry 😂 he's just downed for 90% of the game
Vik and Behz playing together was kinda wholesome. I loved it
How is Harry so bad at games, i feel quite bad for him
What game?
Beautiful. Beautiful. Give us more. Like seriously. Run this again
Quality content need more of this
Banger vid 💪
this was so elite!
Top 5 coldest for bezinga
HARRY needs a SHIELD tell him boys 🤣🤣😭😭😭
We need a Zombies where they complete every challenge because the creator definitely has something made specifically for when they’re finished.
Josh left 3 rounds before but still has the highest headshot 😂
Yes been waiting for it
Vikk and Behz holding it down 👊
Gotta shoot that raygun at their feet bruv Zombie noobs  Amirite?
Almost  a week without a video from more sidemen, but I'm happy this is the video they uploaded
12:13
Ethan clutchin it 🔥🔥🔥
Erm Zerkas 45% headshot ratio when he's not even a regular player anymore. CHEEEEZ
Youtube is getting comfortable with these unskipable ads
Watched the full way through and loved it, keep the cod zombies stuff up
Harry every 5 seconds: FFS!
Lol actually thought jj was playing with them can’t believe they used his laugh in game😂
yes ethan, i still tuned in
You guys gotta help Harry fix his fov he cant see anything
Advice to Harry, melee in his only useful on first couple rounds. It’s useless later on unless you get a Bowie knife.
can someone count how many times harry got knocked?
zerkaa not a real one
"ouh fack off"
bro where is simon man
I wanna see this again but completed, sick video btw
You guys got to redo this map and complete it, bring ksi instead of harry cause hes shit
5:46
I'd love to see you guys play more zombies, this was great
this was incredible we need simon behz vik and josh thats the dream team
The worst sidemen videoes.
these vids are wack
🍗
harry blatantly just doesnt want to play
Harry at 100 hp while everyone else is at 220 made me laugh so hard !!
the hud looks like csgo, is that csgo lol?
Really enjoying these zombies vids, try black ops one its a bit harder i think
Amazing map, wish we had game sound tho :(
Can’t believe they never went in the boxing ring
Sidemen all day zombies?? They randomly come and go throughout the video to eat and use the bathroom (sometimes u could have all 7, other times 3 or less)
Yeah that was better than this weeks main channels vid.
Harry has the worst aim ive seen in ages #sprayandpray
They need to to do an actual Easter egg with miniminter behz  Vik and josh would be mad
hi
Harry HAS to be dying on purpose, right?  There's no way he' failing kiting enemies here, right?  It's a basic skill...
We need another 1 of these❤❤🎉
Replace Harry for Simon , I beg
thank god
Can we please get a full sidemen play on this. Aweeome video love the long video
Would love to see Jon/MrDalek play this.
e
What the name of the game plz 😭??
BEZINGA TOP 5 COLDEST MOMENTS!
Elite content as always
what game is this?
ill try this sleeping lol
Tape checked it was indeed not a crawler that Harry killed
Harry gets packapunched mtar from the box but doesn’t use it
Use me as a "Watched the whole thing" button
Be careful playing BO3 hackers are out of control and it’s getting dangerous to play BO3 especially online
Good thing this wasn’t live streamed lol, get booted by shit head hackers in the first 2 minutes
another one with JJ
We need more custom zombies, my fav videos by far!
This is definitly not Harry's game, please sub him out.
I like the vik ethan and josh synergy in zombies
Sidemen and VanossGaming, Terroriser, Nogla, Wildcat, Moo, and the rest of the guys in gun game, Gmod, Mario kart, or anything would be a great video
BEEN WAITING FOR THiS ONE
Those KSI edits are killing me!😂😂😂
it‘s honestly impressive how bad harry is at every game he plays lol
didnt even realize it was 43 minutes long lol i was so engaged in watching😂😂
Only the true ones watched till the end
they should do this again but get simon instead of harry and try to actually finish the map
45 mins dang
no game sound?
if you shoot the XIX bottles, you get points
JJ, Simon and Tobi should try this map
Harry :- where's the crawler .  *Harry is the crawler😂
Behz pregnant girlfriend bringing him dinner with the puppy running in while he’s on zombies with the boys playing on a map of a mansion he lived with them in is fucking GOALS. What a life 😂
I will enjoy watching you boys, proceeds to look at phone
Ethan having constant frame drops
I’m not gonna lie this is probably my favorite 2ed channel video, just felt like I was ina group call on Skype
Make more zombie videos, they are amazing... the best game ever made by COD like the old days blacks ops 1 & 2 and maybe even 3... or make a live stream of the best sidemen zombie players and reach the highest level
Harrys fov is so annoying
23:00 yo its been fukin ages since iv heard the term run up a R*pe Train 😅🤣😂 thats some 2010 zombies lingo right there
played this map myself. its insane
Replace Harry with Simon and I think y’all would win
I have got a puppy in the room! Ahh my dinner is ready guys☠️☠️☠️
both means rest eyes damn staring contest
can you continue playing madision plz
Poor harry is on 60 fov the entire time
What cod is this is it bo3
i can’t help but feel this is a part 2 to some other video i haven’t seen
Ethan behzinga zombie masterclass
Behz had a nice run to be fair
Harry just makes me feel so good about my own gaming ability sometimes…
Need more of these gaming videos lads. Couldn't really get enough of it even if you upload them daily.....well, it depends actually
Siiiick map tho styll bro
yous should get phil in the charity match
"OMG Massive!!!" Got me good😭😭😭
Harry legit is me in cod if I was in this situation I'd just leave 🤣
shoulda been simon>harry
KEEP THESE COD ZOMBIES COMING
sidemen play prophunt please
Need more zombies
Harry is quite literally the worst zombies player in the world 🤣🤣 but my god is it funny 🤣🤣🤣. Just stand still and runs into corners 🤣🤣
Sidemen do amoung us and cod these guys taking over
Those big bosses with those arm cannons are mangler soldiers.
theres 4 of u
Yes bez us zombie fans creamed over this, to say you lot arent zombie pro yall did good :)
Vikkkkkkkkkkk reppin a m60 like a black guy with a long shlong 😂
relaxxx
Im okay guys dont panic hahahahah
redo this map with simon, harry is so annoying
these vids on zombies are the best we need more!
Harry may have died many times but Harry really carried this content 🤣🤣🤣
Harry just can’t grasp the concept of don’t corner yourself just stay open and I’m all here for it😂
W EPISODE NEED ONE WITH THE OTHER SIDEMEN
Surprised people aren’t crying about Harry and Josh leaving early like last time.
What cod is this? Has to be bo3 right??
HARRY HAD 34 downs LOL
Please do more of these. Loved every second
More zombies
its hard to keep eyes open its like a staring contest hahahha
I have watched the SDMN since 2013 and I always remember Ethan having shit internet 😂😂 He needs some serious Internet ahahahah! Brilliant Video doe
Is this a half life 2 mod?
Harry: i'll stay alive Also harry: plays with controller and cant use thumbs
Please do more.
That was a great video
Harry is that one friend who does nothing in the group project and gets an ‘A” 😂
JJ uploads a video finally and now this. I'm feeling spoilt.
Harry with 34 downs is a real contribution
500?
This is honestly goated
19:30
Hello
harry isnt very good at zombies is he?
how harry said its fine 19:25
hahahahahhaha
Hell yes rother Behz we still here
This video and this whole map is a masterpiece
So gassed over long moresidemen videos, even more than main channel
❤
Harry wasn’t even in the downwards spiral. He’s just really bad at shooters.
43 mins cmon
Ethan needs a new wi-fi man what is this. Man should never have to ask his pregnant fiance to turn off netflix
I feel for Harry man this is me with my mates when I play zombies 😂
As we've now found out, Harry isn't quite as their previous player 4, Simon.
I wanna see part 3 for this I want to see them finished this
w
If i was in viks position i would be fuming like how many times harry knocked out😂
the “connection interrupted” was so nostalgic lmao
Harry getting revived every 30 seconds is great😂
Only thing that makes this video better is if we had game audio, however i know how hard that would be
Name of the game??
55 Min gang
woah I caught 2 sidemen videos before they hit the 1 hour mark... thats insane ahaha.
Are y’all on bo3? Cause if so I wouldn’t be playing online if I was y’all the ip pullers are insane
We've all been finessed by the thumbnail 😂
Surely slight of hand should of been in JJ’s room.
Well played lads tho! Also amazing map design pretty sweet.
You have no idea how much I wish JJ was here for this💀
I loved it. It was like going back to the days 😂
Continue this series. Its so good
Speed in the UK
Finallly
Bro Harry’s so baaad, how tf did he not play COD when he was younger??
harry with the negative kd
Harry getting downed every 20 seconds is fucking hilarious
Nice Video!
Vikstar the medic
Harry is shite at this game it’s so funny😂
sounds like you problem 🤣🤣
what game is this tho?
Have to say really enjoyed this zombie series
Really liked this one!
It's crazy how good this game was made.
I wonder if they found the easy mode button
plz finish the challenges!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ethan and Vikk carried this vid
Harry needs to increase his FOV holy balls. Somebody please give him all the settings
need more of these fucking hilarious
Ya gotta show w2s how to turn up his fov thats why he’s doing bad 🤣
😂
Need more zombie sidemen videos
Where's the link
Harrys camera settings are so shit, someone should tell him. No wonder he doesnt see the zombies coming
Bit shit everyone pissed off. Why would you plan to play zombies 5 minutes before dinner 😅😂
Instagram bots have made their way into YouTube comment sections. We must all come together to fight this atrocity before it leads to civil unrest. Good people of Great Britain and fans of sidemen all over the world, let's put an end to this swiftly.
I absolutely love this series
Harry is so awful 🤣🤣
Good to see fatneek back!!
Harry reviving Josh in the kitchen had me laughing out loud LMAO
Just 43 min?🤧  Watching this gives me the feeling like I have been to the sidemen mansion
This is one of the best videos ever
EARLY BABES
Poor Harry😂😂😂
Harry is like the little brother that you give the unplugged controller too 😂
oh harry
9:13 lol
The thumbnail maker needs a raise
Bhez last stand
Harry playin on 80fov smh
Harry is a mess in the whole 43 min video, and it's so funny.😂
harry needs to keep running lmao
shouldve had simon instead of harry to throwback to the good old videos
Harry needs some better headphone so he can hear them coming lmao
Harry every 10 seconds: Fack off
Harry is so shit at this game lmao. man dies on purpose just to go on his phone, we love his contributions.
I want to see a genuine attempt from the boys, ditch harry and get simon in, and play when no1 needs to go.
This map is sick. The detail is ridiculous.
Harry moving like McBroom
the zombie roars being replaced with jjs laugh is hilarious 😂
43 MIN VID?????? BRO HELL YEAH!!!!!
Harry man XD
It’s annoying how they aren’t trying to get the wonder weapons😡😂😂
Falling one by one
been waiting for part 2!!!
I hate to say it but it has to be said.. Harry is fucking terrible at zombies man. His FOV triggers me every time I see his POV.
You should try the game call duty infinite warfare zombies

Harry is absolutely useless
KSI Deserve to be a boss. He's the strongest among the Sidemen after all~
I don't want to be mean but how do they not know like bo4 guns infinite warfare and so on
Have never related to Harry more lol
it hurts me when they say juggernaut and not jugger-nog

He isn’t even in the video
Ethan Behzinga at the end🔥🔥
Harry is such a noob at zombies 😂😂😂
Omg yess part 2

FIFTY MINUTES YAY😭💪
I'm still surprised that Harry said yes to play zombies, but I am not disappointed

Harry: I’m gonna stay alive the whole round.  Also Harry: fuck off

Common Sidemen WW
I am a zookeeper in chicago and I regularly feed the hippos day old sausages so they have a taste of their home. I put strings on the sausages and swing them around the hippos they get so mad at me and scream but it's an obsession sometimes the hippos try and break out of their cages but I keep swinging those hotdogs in wide circles over their heads. Luckily my boss doesn't know I do this or my coworkers
It's been a while since they last played this type of game lol
Fire vid😊

Big up sidmen😄
