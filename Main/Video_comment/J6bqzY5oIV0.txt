IKD

Bruh no one cares about luigy
Hey SMG4 I know you’re just a recap of Mario but blue and for the past few days I’ve been drinking Mario blood
This was my first episode :,).
Has anyone seen nentindo uses ninja mode using a Wii remote from temu
0:26 the sexy pinkmin party
Yknow after all this time I wondered why doesn’t lawyer Kong just use the same powers on leggy like he did to Mario? She technically is a Nintendo character  Edit: i know she has knowledge on the law and can find loopholes but all the things that she couldn’t find a way around such as claiming her as Nintendo property just like Mario
8:33 I can’t believe it actually happened
8:31 well that didnt go well 3 years later 😢😢
First sml now smg4
Biggest fan
Just spreading the gospel: Jesus died on the cross for you and me and came back to life 3 days later so whoever follows him will have eternal life! Jesus loves you❤
For me, this arc is the best of all SMG4 have made, such a shame a legend like hin is retiring 😢😢
Anyone else rewatching arcs and episodes after knowing SMG4 is ending?
Even after fighting for his channel to stay, it ends only 3 years later 😢
is this fake or real
07.02 mario ulti max power😂
i love wii❤

#### you kong
no tiene sentido el halcón del juicio si fuera una demanda real tienen que borrar todos los vídeos donde aparece Mario  y un canal de peluches que usaban también a Mario  si le llego una demanda de verdad y si borro todos sus vídeos y comenzó su Canal desde 0
Poor Luigi
Parody is usually legal under copyright law, and if this isn't parody, then I don't know what is. The problem is YouTube, it always and automatically sides with copyright holders, without confirming whether they are right, because it's cheaper that way. Less human reviewers need to be hired.
7:56 TOM SCREAM MENTIONED
this kong is evil
This August 20, 2025, marks the third anniversary for the beggining of the Lawsuit Arc, the last standalone arc so far, and the one that brought us the first redesigns of SMG4, SMG3, Bob, and Boopkins. Sometimes I wish SMG4 would go back to these kinds of arcs; the Puzzlevision Saga is already getting too long.
This day and this episode Nintendo they started attacks for SMG4!
3 Years Anniversary For First Appearance The Lawsuit Arc! 3 Years ago Nintendo they started attacks SMG4!
Dude just let them make the game he's gonna be gone for only a bit what's wrong with that?

When meggy says: "Hold it! or Objection!" It reminded me of  Ace attorney.

3:11 How Mario lacks brains... He could stretch his nose like a meme. He would do that. And immediately take down those ninjas. Lol.
Mario arrested for Smg4 sued.
Smg4 are you scared in job application
5:47
SMG4: Made an entire arc about getting betrayed by Nintendo. SML: Didn't need an arc, they actually got betrayed by Nintendo.
You should turn your Nintendo characters into original characters you came up with because you might get a Nintendo letter about using copyrighted characters
Why is Nintendo using Wii U
Is the game really

Two or three years ago, I would’ve said SMG4 just got cold feet over nothing. But considering what Nintendo has become today… God only knows if his fears at the time weren’t justified.  Nintendo needs to fail. To whoever is reading this, stop buying their products.
I find It crazy how many laws Lawyer Kong and his team were able to break in 10 minutes because I can count at least 5-6 off the top of my head.  Trespassing, breaking and entering, aggravated assault, battery with a deadly weapon, kidnapping, and more!
1:58 you’ll never take me alive 😂
Cool part: 5:58
2:27 , bro really hit that “GET BACK TO WORRKKK!!!!!” *then proceeds to whip Mario with the Wii controllers*

I don't like this DMCA don't do that lawyer Kong please for mario😢
Lawyer Kong has to be the first character (that I've seen) who didn't freak out after something grabbed onto his head.
How was this 2 years ago
Cleaver using the WII and NUNCHUCKS as ACTUAL nunchucks XD
Hi
Ace Attorney References are PEAK. Her “HOLD IT!”s and “OBJECTION!”s are very similar to Mia Feys’s objections and stuff. Wish they had a EUREKA!
That's smg2
YouTube: token and nicole

5:46 This Make My Banana Cat Shocked
Hey Bananacat Meets Him🍌🐱 5:26
Nintendo?
4:53 lmao first of all why do i feel so bad second of all wth
Nintendo loves sueing people
Miamoto, one of the best nintendo guys, like the one and only... REGIE, he just didnt want violance in that game, he just needed something to make a game with, but LAWYER KONG, THE WORST
I sense oh no the wishes of SMG4 crew and Nintendo Characters in SMG4 i sense an aura means fear they are in danger along with their wishes because of Lawyer Kong and his Nintendo company minions i sense his aura their is a confetti contract aura and its turning selfish Lawyer Kong has a selfish wish is to bring Nintendo characters back the way they are and banned the SMG4 and his crew
¡OBJECTIONS!
0:26 NOOOOOO STEVE STEFAN AND STEFANIE
9:09
Nintendo of Japan & America would be amazed with Lawyer Kong
who's watching this in 2024 👇🏻
Why is thar some times you war m hat
2 Years Anniversary For this episode and The Lawsuit Arc! And this day where's Nintendo he attacks SMG4!
5:29  meggy x lawyer kong
Wtf 👎💩 super mario odyssey?
3:20
When he looked like blue mario.
This was such a pathetic excuse for an arc considering the antagonists before (Niles) and after (Mr. Puzzles) were both so much better. This whole thing was an excuse for Kevin to finally get rid of the Nintendo parody elements of SMG4 to make it more corporate with the merchandising rights.
SMg4
1:09 My favourite Part
1:10
The old smg4 is so original
4:01 the meaning of the audio😅
Sml got sued, but Smg4 didn't
I’ll be back once this hits 2 years.
Bro predicted super mario wonder
Give me liver🫵🤨
just pull out the Wii remote and press pause that's what Mario did in Nintendo memes 10
Hindi ko alam kung paano ito
Nintendo is on a kill streak first SML now SMG4
Anyone 2024?
8:41 How bout SMG3
3:55 “yahoo with gun” 😂😂😂
HUH
Wait, I thought there was a vid where they sang and it was like this…
The new smg4 is beter
I think what sml said to lawsuit smg4 and other plushie mario videos i think nintendo actually followed 💀
SMG4 stands for super Mario games4
0:24 pikmin
smg4 can i join
imagine if nintendo replies to this video
Well done to you both
9:35 brooks laugh from one piece lol
its been over a yeat since this arc started and its imo one of his best works simply because of how creative it is.
Mario: YAHOO Bowser: HAH YOUILL NERE GET PRINCESS PEACH BACK MARIO! Goofy ahh laugh  Mario: YAHOO Also Mario: WITH GUN!
As a note, this wouldn’t happen, as all of this should be fair use. Otherwise, it’s a parody and is protected by the law.
7:50 I didn't know Mario played Halo, I guess he feels safe when armor locked
It is so funny that nobody cares about Luigi being kidnapped
Oh my gosh
Also nintedo can't just walk in so in breaking the law and nintedo so get sued
Hi
0:04
Was he actually sued??? Im so confused lol ever since this came out i got scared and confused
2:31 uhoh someone’s about to get f*cked
What's the sound that the Pikmin were playing?
0:23
10:12 "sick!" from fnf
“very scary” -Mario
Bud 1 year oh god
when i heared a knock i thougt it wasmy door
This is the time smg4 still didn't renew his character 🫠
When the nintendo switch logo appeared i thought an ad had just happened
6:22 Uno reverse!
A glitch video
Nintendo when they see someone name "Mario":
And my son and daughter, this is where it all went down and where it allll started
7:13  it's back now?
7:02  cursed
The day he fell off
Lawinagad Kong is A Nintendo Paper
Why can’t Nintendo just copy and paste Mario??? 😂😂
Lawer Kong 👎
8:12 WE ARE NINTENDO  YOU CANNOT BEAT US

Happysfhyohyhhghhhj🎤
sml moment
MARIO USES HIS BRAIN FOR ONE
Bro image this was real and we were watching from a reuploaded channel.
i got resercher human ego
Yes
As a veteran of this channel, I can confidently say that this is the last arc with the Mario version of SMG4.
Wait isn’t meggy Nintendo property too?
●○□□■¤♤♡《●○{●\●|
Lawyer Kong = "Aaron Peters"
I guess you can say that this aged like wine
SMG4: I made this cool arc based around Nintendo suing the SMG4 channel! Apollo's gift of prophecy:
CANt believe this was a year ago
Can anyone tell me the background music when mario is about the leave
And now GMod getting DMCA'd by Nintendo. SMG4 is a prophet.
And would you look at that. Unless Luke somehow pulls off a David v. Goliath situation, they’ve gonna have to resort to Supermariologan’s Hail Mary.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
0:14 when your final report card comes in
How ironic that its becoming real now.
ass
...its becoming real now....how could we not see the signs.
I don’t get why people don’t like this arc I think it’s still pretty good
Never mess with the Nintendo ninjas
Its only a matter of time before he ackuallly gets sued
I’m in love with the song
Atlease Luigi is having fun
This is what happened to SML never let it happen to SMG4
This video is to real
Why do I have a feeling this happened irl, but he made an arc on it. Like he was getting sued by Nintendo for copyright and he made an arc after it?
NOOOOOOOO😭
😂😂😂😂
Mmm
this vds are sad
I Love Nintendo Switch!!!!!!!!!!
No Mamamia boring
Why yes, SMG4 going under legal issues with Nintendo. Entertainment at its best.
Yyyyyyyy6 and I will 50th on
thats looks memes vs Mintendo lol
wait why did lawyer kong said a meme when nintendos never say a single meme?
Lol
I love Mario. He is so funny 😂
Bro literally made a court meeting suspenseful
WHO HATES NINTENDO?!?!??!
*IT STILL COUNTS AS A NIN***DO GAME*
SMG4 is so funny when he screams like that. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 5:21
This was uploaded one year ago when supermariologan got their ceast and desist letter from Nintendo
0:26 So cute😍
Why do I really feel like I should me making a video for my Chanel on YouTube but I can’t stop watching… What I’m saying is you guys are doing so well 😅 keep it up

Not gonna lie, I would buy super luigi gardening 😂😅
9:03 has no right whatsoever to be so heartbreaking, and yet, it is
Ijushsyeus
Smg4 is good
They cant dmca under fair use parrodys are alllowed
Poor Mario 😢😢😢 He was kidnapped by one of his creators to obey them😢😢😢
9:00 the hands reaching kills me
Casi te dejo Mario de canal me encanta nuevo luigi por Nintendo ❤❤❤❤
Did Mario just eat a pikmin
Lawyer Kong after he saw Mario being the last person… although he wanted payback.
😊
How has it already been 1 1/2 years?
4:45 where is that map from??
@Antanticfan32
the way u haven't been copyrighted by nintendo yet is a miracle
next time meggy was like Mario for splatoon 4
Bro did all of this for a model change he is really a legend (no hate)
I feel like Luigi Gardening would be quite popular if you put a good fun work on the game. Nintendo should take notes

“No guns in Nintendo game”  Excuse me what game was Meggy originally from again?
Only the ogs get the toilet paper reference
Miyamoto: NO GUNS MARIO!! THIS IS A NINTENDO GAME! Goldeneye: Am I a joke to you?
1:38 Lawyer Kong: 😡
Donk King Kong mega premium
How To Get 1:57:35
Lawyer Kong never had a warrant to search the castle
NO ONE CARES ABOUT LUIGI!!!LOL😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Usually it's barrel of monkeys now it's brief case of men
Making the Nintendo Lawyer a Kong is genius because their lawsuit with Universal over the rights to Donkey Kong as an obvious ripoff of King Kong was instrumental in creating Nintendo's strict legal doctrine... because the fact they won that case scares them into being ultra-protective of their own IP.
Sounds Like A Fantasy
Meggy: guys how about luigi?  Both(mario and smg4): Eh?
En Chicken gun lo hiciste
Además destrozaste la nave que estaba creando yo para volar
SM4 me enfadé de ti porque destruiste mi nave
This reminds me of SML video can't used plush anymore now everything is suck bad 😔
1:09 OH MY GOD, IT SMELLS LIKE BEEP!!!

Who remembers when this was the newest SMG4 video?
What did you do with the pikmin
Bruh

I wonder, is Mario Meggy’s love interest?
RUN FROM THE NINTENDO NINJAS MARIO!
7:48 THAT FLIP THO!!! Mario Got Skills, Man
Dygxh
damn, 1 year since this already
My question is did this really happen    Did he have legal issues with nintendo
I’ve been dined for 2 years I love his channel
Love this guy
Meggy: "kuya"
Eh...😑
😭😭😭😭😭😭
25😂
They used the nunchuck as an actual nunchuck
Bro as soon as I heard the Digimon World 2 music my eyes lit up! The fact that SMG4 contains anything Digimon related makes me happy!
Man puts all his power to make us laugh he should have wayyyyyyy more subs
He used to use Mario 64 But now he uses custom characters
Hahahaha the monkey doesnt have pants 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂Mario lost mustach
pov kirby and the forgotten land
ㅤ
The beginning of the end
SML: sorry smg4 we  both got sued. Because  idk. Like idk. Smg4:  calm down we need  to do something
Watching at 11:21on a Thursday night!
SMG4?!!!!
Shouldn't mario be dead bc they cracked his neck💀
0:08 what
😢 sad part is what makes this a bad arc is the fact that this could’ve all been avoided because of Maggie’s words now they’re harming them over the Earth there intellectual property that they are not breaking that is totally illegal
Nostalgic smg4 design 😢
Mario oddeysy i beated that game darkerside i won invisible hat
And for those who don’t know what a DMCA is look no further⬇  Digital Millennium Copyright Act Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), is a federal statute that addresses a number of copyright issues created by the use of new technology and the Internet including digital rights management (methods for stopping infringement), and certain rights and privileges (safe harbors) that protect Internet Service
I realised that since this series ended, SMG4 has adopted the new look ever since. This is a real lawsuit he got away with. Goodbye old SMG4 😢

I just realized meggy was probably the lawyer since she was in that one school episode
very great content love it
Did you actually get sued?
Anyone thinking what I’m think right now?
Watching back, they should’ve just let mario be in the game and get it over with instead of making a fuss about it, then we’d still have the masterpiece classic designs
Smg4 and murder drones in same universe 🙀

Hi. What is the music at the very beginning of the video called please
Before everything went downhill
I really love Meggy Spletzer, as well as loving the confidence and heroism radiating off of her, especially when breaking out of the cease and desist ability used on her. A beautiful and a badass girl. 😍🥰😎  This episode on the other hand is really good as well, as it calls out Nintendo of Japan's abusive tendencies when it comes to copyright. Except for Nintendo of America. I do feel strongly about it as well, as that is another threat to preservation and archiving as a whole. It is one of those things where I had fully endorsed for creating bills to combat copyright abuse to level the playing fields. SMG4, you probably might not see this, but you are such a legend, and you do live up to it. Keep doing what you love, and show your fans how much you love them! 😉🤘
Hey good job

Geez, hard to believe it's already been almost a full year (as of this comment) since the beginning of what would eventually be the biggest change of your avatars career Luke. I really respect your ability to adept to current times. Keep on memeing you mad man.

Meggy is my first law school thing I have ever learned
Pikmin in smg4 I thought I would never see the day
i remember this arc and also how the smg3 infinite loop video basically forgets it was there
we need more pikmin in the smg4 series
G formulas primrose primrose
I think used to make games in Clickteam Fusion 2.5. I already made an RPG game. It's called The Walking Box.
PiKmIn?!?!!?
2:35 I can’t have a baby now
SMG4 not caring for Luigi as well 10:02this definitely proves what should happen in the next Smg4 arc I was talking about in the: you made Mario did this video

I guess you could say their new game was GROWING in popularity
Noooooooooooooo😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Was the Lawsuit arc based on Nintendo trying to stop you IRL, or did Nintendo have nothing to do with this?
In retrospect, we can blame Maggie for the entire arc.

*the king of cantaloupe*
What the heck is wrong with you what are you doing are you going to jail Mario😢😢😮
You know if Nintendo really gives SMG4 a dmca or a copyright thing and gets them banned I swear to god I will be all over Nintendos “I hate my fans” ass!

Restraining order! *FLYING TOADDDDDDDDD*
I know it’s just an animation but if you were a YouTuber is this the kind of thing you would do?
What  happened to  smg4?
0:23  I HEARD THAT SONG BUT IDK WHERE BUT I THINK ON ROBLOX
AYO MARIO'S YAHOOWITHGUN™!!!!!!!
This is what SMG4 gets for what he and the rest of the Gand did in the previous episode: If Mario Was the Last Man on Earth. That was the most cruel and unforgivable episode ever. Lawyer Kong probably saw that video and decided to avenge Mario by getting rid of SMG4.

Fanfic writers!  Idea: canon Mario and Luigi end up in the smg4 universe and, *SUPER* confused as to what the heck is this place, first run into Meggy and smg4, and- obviously they’re SUPER weirded out by... everything (no hate smg4 ✋🤚👍) until finally they’ve had *”ENOUGH”* of all this! They run away from Meggy and smg4 as fast as they possibly can, but... a certain SOMEONE was WATCHING the... drama...😱 *gasp* Lawyer Kong?! Seeing this as an opportunity, he manages to get them on his side, not even by any “swindling” “per se” just... telling them about the copywrite infringing, IP robbery, that whole... spiel, and they wind up helping Layer Kong, much to *EVERYONE’S* shock! But then after overhearing Lawyer Kong talking the same way, they’re all: “Oh. Great. Is EVERYONE in this world crazy?!” And they ultimately just end up running off as everyone’s arguing like “YOU’RE *ALL* WEIRD! STAY AWAY FROM US!” I’ll let your imaginations take care of the rest.
5:18 almost thought that knock was real
It's this whole SMG4 Lawsuit real?
Tactical nuke incoming!!!

Ngl its loki sad to see that mario is legally owned by them within the smg4 universe
Remove the 4 at the name and.... NOW IT'S THE GUN
The last video of old smg4’s character
The creator of Nintendo watching this like:👁️👄👁️
“Can we just send our Nintendo ninjas out to find all these nerds who share these memes and do away with them?”  “Sir not legally”    “But yes”       This arc then happens:
Imagine they make that into a real game? Super Luigi gardening? THAT WOULD BE SO CUTE
2:35 *speechless*

Is this actually true about you getting sued.
i love that when mario loses hes mustache he gets pissed off
I can't believe he was gonna get sued by nintendo
SMG4 looks like mario I wonder why they didn't mistake them.
I miss the old smg4 design
5:18 scared the crap out of me. I went back to 5:18 and noticed it was fake. good trick.
Poor Luigi
did you really got sued pls respond
bro mario used 0.001% of his power for that fight
😅
bro i thought someone knocked on my window
See, Sega isn’t AS protective of their ips.

old smg4
This New Arc does have a lot to show, since apparently the Antagonist will not be a Cosmic Entity, a Psychopathic Murderer, or a Reject with Powers. No.... It will just be a Lawyer who does his job and wants the Character that corresponds to him.... Mario, this is going to get gooood....  Here you have my Like SMG4!! You are the Master💎🔥
Nooooooooooooo
Chapter 7 EP LIX: Suing Situation
this is my faorite arc
2:23 fun fact, some people don’t know this but the thing attached to the wii remote is actually called a nun-chuck, which is kinda funny because this guy actually uses it as nun-chucks.
how do you make those emoji
1:27 This is totally relatable. People are still impatiently waiting for the next mainline Mario game
SMG4  PLEASE, DUMB WAYS TO DIE.           PLEASE (:
Did Nintendo actually sue smg4?

I leave for a year or two and now meggy had a voice after what happened in I believe in the war of the two fat Italians
SMG4 cool
I am pretty sure Mario has used guns before. I mean in Mario Rabbids, he uses guns, and in Mario party he also uses guns, so I don’t see why Mario can’t use them.

What NO MARIO
The only reason SMG4 should get sued is not because of copyright infringement, but more of abusing Nintendo’s beloved mascot.
SMG4 should get sued for the episode before this with all the abuse towards Mario.
xd

Did you guys actually get sued
Yes
You actually do got me curious. Just how much legal trouble have you had to endure with Nintendo over the years, SMG4?
nintendo is dumb
😢😢😢🥺🥺

Beautiful movie. Thanks for no bad words in the text :3
Rip lugie
Lawyer Kong having King K. Rool’s laugh sounds cursed.

Nintendo did it to SML and now the greatest channel

I love how they use legal contracts as like magic weapons.
no smg4
6:32 When Lawyer Kong meets Godzilla
Is it me or is SMG4 a HUGE fan of One Piece? I mean, he's got Saiko sounding like Nami and he's got Miyamoto sounding like Brook! YOHOHOHOHOHO!!!!
Miyamoto said no guns. Isn't Splatoon an exception too???
SMG4 the Meme Guardian is coming with another best arc in history...
Why hePittingMario  a box
R.I.P Flowies 😂😂😂 0:24
Smg4 made mario so strong that he even gets back up after a broken neck
did you guys actually get almost sued?
Jesus christ that door knock sounds too real with headphones,  I thought someone was knocking on my door
Marios musthase gets shaved/me O NO
Nooooo
I wish smg4 owned mario
When i first watched this i was thinking “this is ganna be a new arc, theres no way it wont be” and now im able to say i guessed correctly about it being one of SMG4s bestly made acrs
and this is how wofti 2022 is started (i can tell since its alr released)
Just like SML...
Miyamoto literally brook.
😢😭
No more Mario memes no more subscribers
😇😇😇😇😇😇🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
If Nintendo actually sued him f😳😳😳 them
Mario ma boi catched the belt
I think Meggy and Mario can be married after
Nintendo took the kids
The knock at 0:45 scared me so much
5:23 mom
It was amazing not only seeing Mario and meggy fight together as a team like wholesome friends again, but Mario himself also really kicked ass here. When normally he would lose or chicken out or be generally helpless where the others would fight. Plus seeing smg4 and meggys reactions to the dmca and Mario accepting his fate to be taken away hits hard,   came back to this after binge watching all previous years of smg4 and its a great arc with a unique concept
I just feel bad for miyamoto its like a father-son relationship but mario left for 5 years and doesnt want to spend time with him anymore
What’s the music at 1:58?
SMG4 Channel Getting Deleted: AAAAAAA (dies)
5:18 v e r y  s c a r y
2:33 I've never seen anything funnier
you wont get sued because lawyer kong is stupid
9:15 look at background a ninja is acceding
Only in Ohio
mario literally said "mom" and then meggy said "Get behind me mario. i'll handle this." almost as if meggy is mario's mum
Nintendo company: no guns  Me:really Nintendo are you really stupid resident evil has guns on it
you ****
Headcanon: Peach was the one who tipped Nintendo off about SMG4 using Mario because she wanted things to go back to the way they were before SMG4 arrived.  SMG4, if you’re reading this, feel free to use this in the next arc.
At 8:43 (time) lawyer kong blackmails
I was not expecting that Toad ending. That was amazing. SMG4s new model is beautifully animated. It's so much smoother!
5:58-6:21 wait, that means that Nintendo has been giving out false cease and desist orders, meaning they can be counter sued on the grounds of false accusation
I still don’t believe this episode that feels like a one off episode started an arc
When the star took away Mario's mustache I was like: "KIDS GON DIE TNIHT".
I mean, Luigi seems happy enough with this.
10:11
9:55 and that was the last we saw of him
Can you make fishy boopkins and bob as well
I don't know if this is perfect but why luigi you supposed to be on weeeeeeegpie
I would play super luigi gardening
I saw a mistake in this video  When Mario and Maggie get exploded out of the room through they were not in front of the door instead they were somewhere in front of the computer well not exactly in front of the computer but a different wall that’s not in front of the door my point is how cool Maggie and Mario exploded out of a door if they weren’t even shot out of the door
Befor the end it was si Sadd,
“NO GUNS THIS IS A NINTENDO GAME!”  My friend, there is a wiki article about games with guns and there are many games of yours on there.
i hate Meggy cuz of this
oh. oh no.
Hey smg4 pls stop making luigi get hurt
6:08
What 6:-08
I came up with my own thing smg stands for: SUPER MEGA GUN
เห็นกันหน่อยก็เท่นะ
Mario just said ''mom'' like bruh🤣
2:29 was the slickest thing mario has done
5:23 Mom?
Idk why it makes me feel sad 4:53
Welcome to... THE LAWSUIT ARC!
Bro that door knock was so realistic
I just realized: this whole arc could have been avoided if Meggy didn’t do anything. Based on that filming scene of the game, it looked like Mario was near the end of the game Nintendo was developing, meaning Nintendo might have finished filming eventually and let Mario go back to smg4. It makes me curious of how the video would have played out if no one has stopped Nintendo’s filming
think how strong meggy must be to lift mario while swinging on that rope (the rope must also be incredibly strong to support that weight)
If I ever meet a Nintendo manager I will make them watch this video
even when i didn't liked his modern content,im sad that greedy mofos from Nintendo got to that legend
miyamoto no guns duck duck hunt am i a joke to you 😑
영상에 한글 자막 해주세요
6:32
I'd just like to point out that everything bad that happened in this arc was all Meggy's fault.
Mom?
havent been this entertained since the wario bros video where they get rich
Please Don't Delete The Channel🥺🙏

2:34 LOL HE JUST GOT WII'D BY MARIO
Wow, Its been since my first year in middle school that I found out about SMG4. Im now on my Junior year of high school. Ty for making me laugh all these years SMG4!
4:55
Sheesh
so smg4 can anger youtube, a literal GOD, but not nintendo?
10:03 Eh...
6:29 I forgot that meggy studied to be a lawyer a couple years back
So long old smg4.....
Hi SMG4 I love this and I hope you have a good day and you are awesome
Bullet bills are guns
Didn't Mario and Smg4 help Nintendo against Sony when they took over
Genius!!!😮😮
SMGYGODKLRTDKCJSKL
I thought you Use G mod to make these videos and then make the maps but I realize you just animate the characters and you just somehow make the background look perfect it’s green screen for the background yeah whatever I’m saying it’s stupid but I think he does not use G mod
Lesson learned:dont take off Mario’s  mustache or he punches you into space
I didnt see smg4 for several months and i saw this and thought how awful meggy has become. First,she become a freaking human Second,there are too many scenes about meggy Third,she became a oc. not a game character oc. just oc.  bring us back the old meggy😢 (and yes and next episodes meggy becoms back in a squid, but its temporary)
In the nintendo is good
hold it you're not taking Mario away. From. SMG4 he is my favorite character. 😡
Yahoo with gun is such an amazing line I legitimately almost broke out laughing.
This video may be offensive to Nintendo... I think not
did meggy go to law school for 3 days like Spencer Shay?
How is sue is more powerful then the last 3 or 2 arcs
SMG4 is the only guy who can turn getting sued into a dragon ball fight
why didnt mario emu chomp him?
Really?
Is it me or does miyamoto sound like brook
Why does the Nintendo owner laugh like brook (brook from one piece) hes like YOHOHOHO. Wait... When he said look he said luffy san... Definitely brook lol
2:18
2:35 CABOOM
💘
5:18 OMG THAT DOOR SOUND HAD ME SO SCARRED IN IRL OMG THAT SOUNDS SO REAL
Meggy forgot she was made by Nintendo
I been watching since u started your videos make me laugh im here for u until the end
Just to think, all of this could have been avoided if Mario just agreed to help make the game.
Mario thinks paper is toilet paper but when he saves his friends it is toilet paper was paper toilet paper all along and no one knew
best anime of all time
MEGGY IS SO SAD! I WANT O GIVE HER A HUG!
5:22 Something about Mario's voiceline being cut short so he just says, "Mom?" is too funny.
Funky Kong with lawyer powers is legit one of the coolest villains you guys have made.
1:43 Foreshadowing.
SMG4, You Fired
Lawyer Kong is gotta be the evilest smg4 character.Not only he’s a jerk to mario now but he’s goal is to wipe out non NINTENDO characters
Noooooooooo
Lol
Wow, the voice acting has really come a long way. It was fantastic in this episode! :)
I have a question Did you actually get sued by Nintendo
Atari now owns Mario lol
Good ending: SMG4 dresses up as Mario
Nintendo you make Samus and snake have guns why not mario
Was the end a metarunner reference????
Man no one cares about luigi 💀
meggys mom: IM SO PROUD OF YOU MY SWEETEST LITTLE GIRL
Damn it Nintendo!!!!!!!
Is this legit???
Did he get sued
Technically Meggy is an inkling (NINTENDO PROPERTY)
WITH GUN
How do you mace these videos
SMG4 is a good person who is on the "good side". But have you even thinking about it, is he really "good guy"? It can be see in the videos: "SMG4 Gets Sued", "Mario Can't Play With You Anymore...", "If Mario Was In... Splatoon 3", "Breaking Luigi", "[NINTENDO HAS CLAIMED THIS VIDEO]" and "Goodbye, SMG4". And mind i remind you ALL those bad guys that Smg4 and his "friends" have to fight: Francis, Zero, Waluigi and others. Ok, Francis is a real bad guy, because he didn't care about others and he just wanted so much power to himself. But the others (especially Zero/Smg0) tried to fight back by "taking the world" -means they tried to stop the virus Sgm4 who corrupted everyone by turning them into stupid puppets who think they are happy. But actually Mario and others are NOT happy with Smg4. It can be noticed when Mario and others turnes back into normal and then Smg4 tried to "heal" them (corrupt them again with memes) but they DIDN'T want to and they started running away/resisting.  NOTE: This is just my theory, in real life Smg4 is a great guy but in Smg4 universe he is bad guy.
2:18 Restraining Order 5:45 Cease And Desist
0:53 Lawyer Kong WHERE IS HE
Sml and now him
9:06 you know this part is serious when its so smooth
I mean it would be cool if Animal Crossing had a mod or a realease, in which you could play with other Nintendo characters, like Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong and ect.
Is it me or miyamoto sounds like brook from one piece
Sadly the next smg4 video if Nintendo has there way is, hold up let me check my notes.... 2082.... tragic
god i just know that lawyer kong is gonna be in wotfi xd
3:38 😂😂😂 69 plus😂😂
Is this for real
I love how he just caps Bowser then continues I'm weak
How to end this mayhem: change a pixler on mario's model
YOOOOOOOOO
WHY He Got That Nintendo Letter?
3:46 bowser has a weiner
been watching this channel since 2016, beautiful to see it still going strong!
0:45, that knock had no business sounding so realistic.
6:22
Lol
why didnt he just burn kong aswell
Just remember if you got chosen to delete your account remember what SML did they got sued and they changed characters and names like Mario is now marvin and black yoshi is yo boy duggie, Smg4 I hope you read this🙏
i love how he hit the guy in the nuts with a nintendo it made me wheeze my head off
Did you actually get sued?
While he may be a villain I hope lawyer kong does get a second chance after this arc is over. I mean he most likely was going to let mario go after the game was complete. But when the DMCA was signed, he lost all chances of being on friendly terms with mario
instead of woomy
mario calls him meggy when she swoops in and save him
😱🥺😥😢😭🖕
Sorry about having your accounts getting hacked.
2 arcs in the same year? ngl the sotry arc is really good
lawyer kong is copy right him self so he has to turn him self in?🤔
lol! Mario everyone worries but when Luigi gets taken, they let him get a big fat L
6:59  Why didn’t he just eat the star
I have been watching him for like YEARS I remember when Splatoon was a massive hit and that's what was mostly what he posted (which basically means meggy was in every video for most of 2018 -2019 I think)
is meggy like mario's GF
Lawyer Kong: This isn't the last you've seen of me. 9:53
5:18 got me good
Isn’t meggy half nentendo?  Wasn’t she a splatoon character?
2:35 ayo? 😳😳😳
your still gonna make normal videos right?!
hey smg4 do you own it a Nintendo Wii U
Imagine during the WOTFI 2022 episode, that they legit have a rap battle in the court room 😂
Lawyer kong got no bitches
5:17 I think they knocked on the window instead of the door to the left
Uh
Meggy x mario
I SWEAR THAT WAS THE BEST FIGHT ANIMATION IVE EVER SEEN
and this is the day lawer kong ruined everything...
It ends on my birthday noce
WOTFI 2022 comes on October 15th
1 episode away from the finale
thsi is best content
worst arc ever
i wasso sad of that video when everyone dissapeared
Does anyone else notice meggys voice is different
5:18 scared the crap out of me lmao
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
0:58 “Can he see me?” had me me dying XD
Technically,guns are fortnite items and fortnite is on the Nintendo.
how is this funny its not funny go watch half of 2014 to half of 2019
Omg, I started crying until Miyamoto knocked down the door and said "NEVER MIND RELEASE MARIO, HE'S GARDENING!"
That is funny 😆.  Lo
1:57 you’ll never take me alive!!!!!
Don't joke around with that. NINTENDO® is Actually going to do that. They would sue a 6 year old child with stage 4 cancer for having a Mario themed Birthday Party.
5:23 mom
It's cool that meggys a lawyer
❤ 😂🎉 Okay
Yeah daddy mommy
vodka in ak47 russia in caming
Lawsuit Arc Has Just Begun In Real Life Nintendo Many Shutdown Many Nintendo Fangame
6:22 I just realised the Steins;Gate reference lol
After much searching we finally have Mᴀʀɪᴏ
Honestly, this is one of the reasons I'm a Sonic fan. Because SEGA doesn't give a crap about people making Sonic content on the internet, no matter which way he's interpreted.  And hey, as long as it's not a game, you're allowed to make money off of it, too.  Seriously, I just don't get why Nintendo has such a problem with this kind of content (that is, if they even do. We don't actually know if Nintendo cares about Mario being in SMG4 yet).
3 Como siempre buen video
Luigi respect!😢
mario Buen video, ahora toca verlo
9:58 what the name of this background song?
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
This should be called the origin ark
5:22 I love how Mario says "Mom"
Why Does Meggy Not Count As a Nintendo Character? She's clearly in Splat 1, 2, and 3.
Hgjkskskskkdkdkdii 2:00
i like smg4 and lugi and smg3 keep up the hard work :) pin me and comment me
5:21 mom?
Daddy
I thought the relevations arc was the last
"he's gardening"
Imagine Nintendo does a little trolling and ACTUALLY sues SMG4
Now that I you think about it how many times has smg4 been sued
smg4 moment
Mario may be dumb, but he has some smart ways to battle!
5 years and counting watching you keep it up man love ya
2:35 *thousand years of pain*

Hi
I smell an arc
Funny
how has this not happened in real life yet? Nintendo likes their copyright like Asians do their math
I feel so old I watch his second video  he realesd
After super Mario Logan got sued by Nintendo and I saw this video I got very very concerned because I thought the same thing was happening to you very grateful it’s not though you’re very lucky to not be in the same situation as Logan keep up the good work love the videos
Let's start donating to SMG4 so he have money for permission and rights and laws of Nintendo Etc and so that SMG4 may also have  rights of Nintendo too And special form and contract of Nintendo Right to keep making these videos (daily) in case of accused of copyright (if Nintendo thinks)  Which is the technical term and point of donating etc; (stated)
Movie SMG4 get sued  Part1: meet lawyer kong Part2: ??? Part3: ??? Part4: ???
U are kool my dud
Smg4 Smg4 my mommy‘s in move
SMG4 Mario reacts

Is that Brook’s laugh
I've been with this channel for the past 6 years and it's grown into something extraordinary. Keep it up
0:51 3:13 4:19 4:50 5:19 5:45 6:33 7:57 8:16
I feel like this was Meta Runner in 10 minutes with a slightly different ending
so when is super luigi gardening releasing for the switch? gameplay trailer looks sick
Wait aren’t guns actually Nintendo items? I mean they were in 007 goldeneye for the N64
Did this actually happen
DAMIT THE ARCS ARE BACK
The fact how in 9:55 you can see donkey Kong dad “lawyer Kong” ass
luigi in pikmin 4?
Were not getting a game but were actually getting a movie some time 2023
Will the Nintendo Ninjas be able to beat Mario?
i watch your vids a couple years
I'm still not over how this super Luigi gardening joke came just before the farming Nintendo direct.
meggy is a terrible character in these videos
Smg4 Smg4 A new house can you come
Smg4 Smg4
Love you me I love you 😘💕 A new house you need to come
So SMG4 got sued on my birthday? 🤔
damn these animations have improved significantly from 5 years ago
I wish they actually got sued
Nintendo Arc?
Mario and meggy win they beat the law suit and dk
7:56 tom scream after was made the tom and jerry show or smg4
8:53 why did i think mario was gonna do a meta runner reference here
Bro this animation is so good and the video is too 👍
How epic this is the first time funky Kong was in smg4
If I got sued  Manager: You got sued Me: oh dang it Also me: gets sued and quit YouTube
10:06 LOL YOUR LIKE EH TO LUIGI POOR LUIGI
🤨
Can’t wait for wotfi!
a a a a a a a a
Kill Kong
Technically since Mario is a person, it is illegal to make him work against his will.
The guard getting punched in the pingas with a wii controller while the intro of the wii is playing is just legendary.
then who was recording them
Did this actually happen or is this a parody of SML being sued
wow you look good!
OBJECTION! Smg4 can’t get sued because he’s using Nintendo characters for parody reasons
e      r
Oof:(
9:18 "Dont Worry Guys, I'll Be Fine"  like smg4, are you TRYING to give me another tear jerking heart attack? lol
Ummm I think the ninjas were meme not normal
Just call them "Red" "Green" "King Troopa" "Princess" "SMG4" and "Squidy"
GLaDOS has 1 question, why is the 4th video in ''the lawsuit arc'' hidden?
Pov: you watch therealsully
Did you actually get sued
If Nintendo made a game when Luigi gardens you can sue then for stealing your idea
Smg4 Smg4  People call me stupid
Bruh you literally did mario a jerk that don't even care about his own brother
Hello😊
And luigi🥺🥺🥺😥😥😥😭😭
this video has actually got me thinking: how has nintendo not gone for SMG4 yet?   I mean, they already went after SuperMarioLogan for using Mario characters, especially in pretty inappropriate manners, and SMG4 has Mario cursing and such as well. The SMG4 Character itself is also a Mario reskin, so it’s a little weird to me how Nintendo hasn’t started sending their DMCAs and Cease and Desist notices.   SMG4 also makes money off of these videos of Mario & friends cursing and such. (At least I’m pretty sure)  ASSUMING Nintendo hasn’t given SMG4 permission to use Nintendo’s copyrighted characters, this is Copyright Infringement.  Nintendo also isn’t afraid to come knocking at people’s doors, big companies or small creators. They went at ROBLOX over things such as Pokemon Brick Bronze, and are also huge haters of Mario fan games, so how has Nintendo not come knocking on SMG4’s door?
4:55 he got so mad an ad played
I love how they’re doing more animations it’s really cool and enjoyable
Smg4 Smg4 call me FaceTime me
10:15 SMG4 PREDICTED FAE FARM :')
I watched this channel from 2013 to 2019 so this is a very good video I watched in a long, long time... whether the title refers to something real or something upcoming.
i knew this was an arc
Ok, seriously, how does SMG4 actually not get copyright claimed? Anyone know how YouTube & Nintendo’s Copyright and Claims work? Please?
The digimon world 2 music was epic!
2:36 the sound of the WII XD
5:45 CEASE AND DESIST
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LUWEe
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MARIO
BRO THE QUALITY. HOW MUCH DID I MISS. IT GOT BETTER. HOW.
Skull brook 💀💀
Lawyer Kong is my favourite character now
Good
Hit him with the dmca smack down, how cruel.
Well, I can’t say I’m surprised… I mean look what happened to SML… 😬
The day SMG4 gets a cease and desist is the day I stop supporting Nintendo.
You really brighten up my day with your memes
6:27 0_0 NANI!?!?!
When I saw this title I shat myself
WHOS WRITING THIS
SMG4 te están copiando
OML17:15 is so FUNNY
IS MONTY MOLE OK
The YAHOO YAHOO WITH GUN part is funny
8:50 No one's reacting how SMG4 put a reference from Meta Runner 1x10?
WHOOO! YOU LIED THAT THE REVELATIONS ARC WAS THE LAST ONE! BUT MAYBE THIS IS!
1:55  Mario:Shut up!
I mean, if Nintendo (for some reason) doesn’t have grounds for suing SMG4 over Mario, they may have grounds for suing SMG4 over Meggy due to them resembling, and originally being, an inkling. Which is Nintendo’s intellectual property. But they own Mario, so I don’t think they’d need to bring that up if this for whatever reason sent to court.
Chapter 1:the waluigi Chapter 2:the rapper bob ark Chapter 3:the anime ark Chapter 4:the youtube ark Chapter 5:the genesis ark Chapter 6:the revalation ark Chapter 7:the lawsuit ark
I thought the arcs were over?
2:35 THIS MADE ME NEAR DIE OF LAUGHTER
thanks for reminding me why i don't like nintendo i love the games they make but they are very sensitive if they do something without their license
I will make you  fans don’t comment on my channel because of the sexual content for the words that say in the videos and a Copyright infringement of a song called Napal Baji from PSY. Used without permission in Fat Italians rap battle 2017.
Why is lawyer Kong shouting “RESTRAINING ORDER” so funny to me?
The animation is super clean if I’m being honest. Really cool to look at.
7:01 Mario without a mustache doesn’t exist, it can’t hurt you. Mario without a mustache:
10:20 Should've been a 7.8/10. Too much water
Im so sorry to say this but Mario and Meggy would be a Great Ass couple, Everytime they fight, they kick ass LMAO
OGs remember the ninjas called Butt Ninja
That battle music is very familiar... Digimon World I think? Someone help me out
We need an entire separate video where Maggie is just a lawyer
At least smg4 hasn't updated his oof sound
Next arc - The Lawyer Arc
Is this een actuall true story that this has happened
8:31 First SML, and now this? Both of my favorite channels can’t be getting sued! 😔
Rip Luigi
I never thought I’d be going to law school watching a YouTube video
7:03 mad power
Mario and meggy are badass, just like the movie badass.
I thought it was gonna be the end of him. Nintendo wasn't playing around.
who thought he was actually gonna get sued by Nintendo?😂 I was like end of an era for smg 4.
He needs his gun
What
Miamoto: no guns this is a Nintendo game Also Nintendo at the start of its life: *sells illegal playing cards*
Why is smg4 sad when dmc4 comes u have like 4 channels
If this actually happened im gonna mirder nintendo       But this vid was halirouse as shit
Hey why isn't Saul Goodman here man
Mario's buttons change colour for some reason
Now this is EbIC
te vdieo AMAZING
beeg sad on 9:03
Alot of people forget Luke been planned for if this ever happened. He slowly built a cast of original and non original characters and has introduced arcs to rewrite the few non ocs into lovable ocs while staying within the design criteria and if he wanted to turn Mario into someone completely else this would be the arc it would mean he could slowly phase out the reliance on Nintendo ips
MEGGY can be cease and desisted because she used to be squid kid
Wait but actually can you still make content like this
The lawsuit arc?
Nintendo has the high ground now smg4
2:35, he be going WIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII...!
i mean 3:55
2:55 very funny
7:55
perfectulay cut screams 9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999
A nintedo arc! I can already see it.
Smg4: time to delete lawyer Kong brain
Smg4: *gets sued* Sml: ayy welcome to the club
I've been watching this for years and can say I'm glad my daughter has found humor and looks forward to the new episodes you post. I used to have to read her the texts but she's now at the point she can ask on her own. Keep up the good work.
I swear to freaking God they ruin smg4 I will destroy Nintendo's life for good oh and I have a creator that can destroy the Creator Nintendo person
Well welcome to the Nintendo arc🎭
Why can’t they just get a different Mario?
See Smg4 - this is why meggy spletzer should have her own ace squid attorney series cause she has what it takes to be a good defense lawyer. 😒
Hai bestie!
What a gem of the internet I have encountered. I'll subscribe.
Journey lives on
4:53 cry about it
THE NINTENDO NINJAS ARE REAL?!?
6:41 omg Nostalgia punched me right in the face. Digimon World 2...
If Nintendo see this video smg4 this is might be problem
First SML, now this?!!
Autocorrect is one day gonna kill all of us and the I is yoshi
Why is mario acting like how I when you and mario tried to pay his taxes
I thought one of the guards was gonna be Swag and Chris 😅
LOVE IOL SMG4
Is that brook from one piece i hear?
Alright bois. Just like Meggy...Mario might get a re-design.....
*Congratulations on 6 million subscribers, SMG4!&*
FINALLY AN ARC
Someone:Don't worry if smg4 gets sued they can still use the names and just like change Mario's logo!  Sml: am I a joke to you?
Is this another arc?  What it’s the lawsuit arc? 😐😐😐 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤 GOD FU-
I never expecter anyone else to know Digimon World 2's battle music.
**PROCEEDS TO RUN TOWARDS LAWYER KONG AT LIGHTSPEED AND THEN BREAK HIS NECK, AND THEN ERASE HIM FROM EXISTENCE USING APERTURE SCIENCE ANTI-EXISTENCE EXPLOSIVE LEMONS NUKES THAT ARE FILLED WITH GRENADES MADE FROM LEMONS THAT EXPLODE AND THEN TURN INTO LEMONS THAT LAWYER KONG IS THEN FORCED TO EAT UNTIL HIS FACE CAVES IN WHEN THE LEMON NUKES EXPLODE, THEN HIS FACE CAVES IN PURELY FROM THE SOURNESS OF THE LEMONS,  THEN HE STOPS EXISTING**
Poesia è scemo è proprio fare un video un po' più vicino che mi piace Silvia Io odio scimmia
Bad Ending: SMG4’s Channel Got terminated but lugi tells Mario that he Was her brother mario leaves lugi smg4 and meggy from behind and Mario Works Nintendo again Mario’s Personality Has Been Changed To Orginal
The one that mario takes a gun is actually true nitendo actually did this but its now replaced with the fire flower or something so uh yeah
Did you really get sued?
•5:50 => Ace Attorney 1's Telling the Truth theme. •5:59 => Ace Attorney 2's Pursuit theme
4:03 your the one to talk nintendo: the xenoblade, splatoon, and bayonetta franchises have guns
Wait, another arc
Bro SML now SMG4? You guys are the Nintendo legends of YouTube!
4:26 pingu
I repeatedly got spooked by the knocks, well played with the one headphone trick
And, make a video where Luigi gets his revenge on Mario form what he’s been through! Please.
Why do I feel meggy is dramatic?
Al final Mario se salvó del malvado contrato de nintendo y Luigi tuvo su buen juego de nintendo
Remember when this guy started, and rape jokes were the funniest thing ever? Now they'll get you a termination, cancellation, and an execution.
It good
Yahoo with gun™️ that made me laugh😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please mario olay rtx baldi
is this the last arc
Sml in a nutshell
Smg4 got smled
i hope nintendo doesnt pull an SML on smg4, their videos arent the same anymore and ive known about both for years. whatever you do though, do NOT rename mario to marvin lmao
Mario.sad  😭😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺😫😭😢😢
lawsuit arc?
YES NEW ARC
SUSMG4
Give back axel
Wait Mario  is a enemie in Pikmin
I might be in the wrong here but i think meggy and Mario should be together in the future since their friendship is so wholesome
I laughed so hard when Mario says “Mama *beep* DAMN IT” 4:16
Is this actually happening in real life
omg I love the animation in this it looks more alive
whats the song that starts playing at 9:59
when u wanna play ur fav game but smg videos are too good: REEEEEEEE
Oh boy a new arc
I know she isn't voiced by Lizzie anymore, but I still love that Meggy went to law school.   I'm fascinated with cute redhead lawyers.  [Context: Meggy used to shame the same voice actor as Yanfei from Genshin Impact, and the parallels they share are striking.]
Not only Nintendo doesn't allow guns, but every Super Mario Bros. game (not every mario game) literally is the same but higher quality.
The guy
But some one can help
If this is an arc which character is he gonna kill off next or is this a happy ending arc
this was ACTUALLY A ARC?
So Meggy went to law school partially… But has the skills to be a lawyer. Swag!
YEAH! NEW ARC!! YEAH, BOI!!!
I am Sad
What's the new name for this arc again?
Mario your literally the mascot of Nintendo
Very First Era
Metal Mario sceen was kinda fire
the lawsite arc? why you make it that
amazing animation damn
Why u use g-mod for these fire and ragdol
I like the new arc so far
Are you getting sued
The lawsuit arc huh nice name for this
2:36  This part was inspired in the video: mario goes to the marioverse
I can't tell if it's the same voice actor for meggy or it's someone else being here for a while? What happened to the original voice smg4 😢
AYYYYYYY ANOTHER ARC
LOL IGN at the end be like: 10:19
Ah yes i cant wait for super luigis gardening to come to switch
New arc baby!
Guys why do I have a feeling that this is a start of a new arc?
I been watching you guys for 2 or 1 years now and pls tell me this is just fake pls
0:45
Ah yes a new arc
I wonder if smg4 is going to change the characters or make new models at the end of this
Hi
You guys are very special!
4:10 this is the first time smg4 has made me laugh in like years (but that’s not a bad thing)
Do you luv persona 5 or do you just like using their stuff
Why use music from my fav game
Why use copyright sound effect from my fav game
completely owned
should’ve called saul
I miss old Smg4
And I know that arcs kill one. I'm just joking.
Geez! I thought "The Revelations Arc" is the last one! Now it should be Season 2!
INTRODUCING LUIGIS GARDENING SIMULATOR
Ok fr tho I think super Luigi gardening would be sick
Poor luigi
En
1:36 caught me so off guard
i love how luigi was just gardening for that whole video not even knowing the things happening in the castle
The lawyer arc Edit: close enough
doesnt meggy sound like evylyn or that troll in MR3 (meta runner 3
these video feel they are getting more real
🇸🇳 random flag
7:47 this the coolest scene I’ve ever seen Mario do and I’m just at a loss for words on how cool it looked. Bravo. Bravo.
they could’ve just cloned Mario and made the clone his regular self
Yohohohoho 😂 Brook 😂
Lawyer Kong is the coolest character design. The genius of funky kong. The dapper suit. The voice. Perfection!
The Nintendo arc begins
thats brooks voice tho...
This is basically smg4 making fun of sml lawsuit      AND ITS GREAT
Just remember if Nintendo sues you for copyright, all this stuff is canon
Oh yeah... I forgot Meggy was technically a lawyer.
Did he actually get sued?
Wow. Something is about to change the universe completely!
I smell another arc the Nintendo arc
Is that an arc I smell?
Why is miyamoto brook from one piece
"The Nintendo Arc" i suppose?
Is smg4 a family channel now? I haven't had a good laugh at his videos in ages
The amount of Ace attorney references are just funny to me
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Im sensing potential arcs here....could just be my brain doing hop scotch tho
Can jou make me pleas make me smg5 🇳🇱🥺🥺🥺🥺
I been watching smg4 for a 8 years also
MOM?
wait why Miyamoto laugh like Brook + Miyamoto say Luffy san 🤨
2:35
Its so creative that you used all the levels of nintendo controller’s evolution
THE BUTT NINJA RETURNS!!
I thought it was true
Imagine nintendo coments
oh thank God Mario is still in your yt
well, better call saul
They underestimated Marios power level after all of that training in the mario games
Achievement : the ultimate giga good life  With a side of content that can cure a depressed Human achievement :  Godly content +godly mode unlocked just press X . thanks for entering me  And my brain 😄
Lawyer Kong voice sounds like the donkey Kong rap person 😄
Pls make a part too
Hopefully the thing that happened to sml doesn't happen to smg4
Hey SMG4 y didn't you have Melony take a different turn after axols death?
smg4Coolsmg4Coolsmg4Cool
Better call saul moment
Jesus, I died when he hit the ninja with the remotes and he made the noise
4:39 inkling moment
4:55
You sound like Kermit
I haven't watch smg4 for so long i thought this was real lol
option A: mario goes  option B: SMG4 gets sued option C: cancel
Sense when is Mario able to fight he should be too dumb to know how to walk
You needed to put splatoon 1 music
Models are beautiful once you don't know what they are because it feels new you'll never find them but you'll know they'll exist
Oh my goodness This is so good
Now you know how SML feels
😂😂
smg4 is sus
noooooooooooooo
but mario is sus like 1999999990000 days
mario is cool
Miyamato: this gives me a idea  Luigi: dad?
I forgot she went to law school
Gooo meggy
Alot of people probably don’t get taht wii reference
Kong I have property over stars not you and I free Mario
Guys think about this donkey kong said he will be back and go back to!            IF MARIO WAS THE LAST PERSON  Listen okay?  Act 1.  It all starts when if mario was smart In that series (it was a remake part 2 if you didnt know)  Mario friends said They want him to be smarter risking his own life since  mario was the first tester it was risky he could have died But they reacted with this . Meggy: Red you okay? Bob: lol he ded  Act 2.  If mario was the last person on earth You know how it went soooo  Act 3. The video you watch remember this line  "Ill be back ..." Now tell me what Mario friends have been doing to mario  If you dont get the idea this might  Be a arc like walugi arc some hints Mario friends have been  abusing him lately now i said the word abusing cause.....  Thats is what  their doing he gets beaten up for dumb things Not a fully  reason like for if mario was the last person on earth this was the start:   Mario was playing a song saiko came in and hit like tell me what was wrong with playing a song?  Also if you still dont get the idea  The final act.  Mario had enough and goes back to nintendo notice that line "i will be back" feels weird now? I got more ideas but i will leave it  Easter eggs:  Tari in Mario smart And if he was the last person on earth she was in on it  Meaning even tari isnt innocent from this
oof 2:35
He visto a este chico desde hace 3 o no se que años
I will defend SMG4 in court
old content was better + ratio
Alternate ending: USA gets invaded and DMCA is deleted
(10:12) not bad no boss just relax and make gardening
Bro was there a collab or something? The animation here is uncannily solid
🥈🥇🥉🏅🎧🛡🧨⚔️💣🪓🚬🔪⚰️🗡🪦
TBH, SMG4 is a lot more Offensive to Nintendo then Sml.
What if Original Mario and Smg4 Mario are totally different characters?  Think about that.
This video is verry good, Ggs guys
Somehow I feel like this is the start of a new arc.
Not only is this guy using Mario characters, but in his SM64 Bloopers he used emulation to make his videos. This guy is so damn lucky to still be here!
2:33😩😳😳😳😩😏😏🥵🪨
Mai Mai: Remember Kids, Don’t Sue Any Copyright! That’s No Good…
The best part was the ign review
7:48 That was a *CLEAN* roll.
Yoy get sued by mario
I've been subscribed since 2 million subs. And ever since I've always watched your content. Congratulations on 6 million subscribers. And here's hoping for 7.🎆🎇✨🎉

2:33 *wii menu scream*
5:05 *SMG4 scream mario throw*
Thr fact they don't care abt luigi
7:38 RUSSIA ARMY HERE
LOL
I just realised that this entire time Luigi was watering plants
He could of used a owning order on meggy cuz they own her game
Is your channel name “Submachine Gun 4?” Im new
Wait doesn't Nintendo own splatoon they can just delete meggys weapons
I been watching smg4 content for a long time it funny and enjoyable glad I became a member now and showing support for the hard work you do keep it up guys
SWG4😁
SG4
bro the knocking sound almost heart attack me-
But he still makes videos. How?
Lawyer Kong is new Smg4 Villain
No can fight codyright claim on YouTube codyright claim all way win
PSX digimon theme music for fighting scene?
What if Mario and friends were in Jurassic park?
4:02 - Clearly you forgot Mario Party 2, fake Miyamoto
I only wanted this video to see if you did get sued
Youtube comments is so much more grateful of SMG4 than the reddit community lol
8/10 cuz this was pretty entertaining!
Tu qlimassiones es tan locas!!!!!!!!!!!
No offense
Fin del mario
Will there still be Mario videos or was the suit real or anything?
If these scences were funny like   3:00  And  6:58
Crap anim
Meggy est abonné à masdak
Imagine if Lawyer Kong was in smash
meggy is still a lawyer??!
6:11 When ur older brother is an lawyer and ur parents take away ur console
I like memes
Please for the love of god I hope this is just parody and not what happened in irl
Man..it's been a while I have not watch this channel..
it is true that you resisted lawsuits from nintendo
I really love how recently the animation swaps from smooth to gmod
hey stinky
I thought smg4 was actually getting sued
The first smg4 video I saw was the clone o Mario video which was 10 years ago (dang I feel old) but since then I have been watching and have not missed an upload the point is that smg4 has been a part of my childhood and go that I tip my hat off to you Luke
"It's been a 5 years since Mario Odyssey"  Bowser's Fury : why does no one appreciate me 😭
Started watching smg4 in 5th grade im a freshman in highschool now and im so happy i still get to see how he keeps growing
Kids: I Sued Roblox || Teen: I Destroy Roblox || Adult: I Hate Roblox (Sussy)
This is why Nintendo sucks sometimes
You know you're done for when you steal Mario's Mustache.
Bulletosky
When Mario’s musta sh got cut off he magically grew it back is 2 seconds?!
2:35 OOF OUCH
That was a fever dream and I loved every second of it
Sml: first time huh
7:01 POV: your a Mario ripoff
Bro the knock scared me...
Something tells me this is gonna be a start of a new arc.
whats the song at 9:20
Shouldn’t Meggy be under legal trouble since she was originally an Inkling from Splatoon?
Holw molly your animation got so good!!!! I have been watching many years and you have been improving a lot! Keep going!
Make an smg5 for the next wotfi pls
You didn’t actually get sued
The
The
The
Sounds like this also happened to SML
Yes
this is crazy 😧🤣
I still have Nintendo
Smg4 is nostalgic
4:22 ace attorney refrence
Now i get why SMG4 was never attacked by Nintendo. That explained the constant jokes about the copyright that he wouldnt make It consider the situation.
Im using this video for legal advice
SMG4 did you really get sued?!
Wow, the voice acting and animation syncs and looks so much better now especially in this episode and I love to see it.
Bruh this part is good 6:46
MARRIO NOOOOOOOOOOOOO😪😪😪😪
I’m still waiting for the next Nintendo Direct to announce Luigi Gardening
Me wearing headphones and hearing the knock on the door while I’m home alone… 😬
7:04 that man gone
The first SMG4 video I watched was on my 3DS's web browser, It was the villager episode. I still watch him today.
2:32 what it feels like to catch dads belt
Brook for miyamotos voice was genius
YO THIS JUST GAVE ME IDEA. A VIDEO W MARIO TESTING HIS ITEM POWERS
one of the only times marios friends act nice to him
Meggy: hey! Those aren’t Nintendo items  Me: guess she never knew that cod was in Nintendo before XD
Will you make a part 2 plz
"Do you know what this is? " *Toilet paper*
Nintendo was the enemy, but they also saved the day.
Super Luigi Gardening
Bro I remember when you used tf2 sounds and texts, coming back to look makes me happy, you have better animation skills and funnier things :D
10:16 that's
Perfect game i’ll knew that this would be a war of a fat Italian
R E S T R A I N I N G  O R D E R
My thoughts before 3:58: its probably mario but he has a gun
I like how he can make such a serious situation into a comedic art 😂
Plot twist: he didn't really get sued
Wii attack XDDDD
Lawyer Monke: This isnt last time you see me Me: NINTENDO ARC REAL?!??!?!?!?!?!
Just trap them in the minecart universe
In memory of SMG4 2009-2022
This looks like it's the start of a story ark
Never thought this day would come, first Sml now this…
Hopefully this never happen
OH GOD, that music from Digimon World 2 REALLY HIT HOME!
6:57 Ok you can't tell me that that would have cut Mario's mustash (how do you spell that again?) off  it was thrown the wrong way. It also would have cut Marios giant nose.  I'm an idiot that loves nitpicking things, that's all anyone learnt from this.
It's actually surprising that Nintendo hasn't done anything to SMG4
Are you actually being sued for real?
7:31 🤣🤣🤣
you using gmod and i love the animations
Smg4 is the real mario and mario is smg4
SMG4 is in 6 mil yey congrats
Even in serious situations Mario still acts like a dumbass  Smg4 never fails to make me happy
Man for a lawyer he committed a lot of crimes assault kidnapping attempted murder and taking a hostage
Mega chad mario🍷🗿
Super luigi gardening actually sounds like a good mario game
Mario be better calling saul
SMG4 Got sued for reaching 6 mil subcriber
I'm supprised that this channel is still uploading
I think this is the only time When Meggy got even greater
that knock genuinely scared me
so the sense  of humor is now loud, widen, loud, and deep fried = funny?
Yo
I saw red pikmin dancing. Oh!!! My!!!!! Goooood!
Mario eat0:0:26 Nintendo work1:41 Wii Nintendo 2:23 Garding 2:41
sus
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
5:34 this but out of context
Is this the final video?? If yes: Goodbye SMG4… If no: the YouTube channel is here!
Noooo smg
SML almost getting sued and then smg4 😔
So we not gonna talk abt how this man got beat with a wii remote?
I'm surprised nobody asked what song plays at 6:55
Am i the only one who thought there was going to be a better call Saul reference
😅
NOOOO SUED
4:26 NOOOO
I didnt saw your animations since like a looong time... guess the last I saw was the Meggys trip... and I see that you still making autoconclusive lovely stories full of funny characters!!! Did I lost mamy things?
I literally fucking hate meggy she’s always trying to be the fucking hero and she was kinda better with her squid sound
Siesta grasioso pero es estúpido en fainasfredis
xd
hold up a minute ,i just realize one thing,meggy as a little bit same voice as yanfei in genshin impact....   *takes somes researches*  WAIT MEGGY VOICE IS YANFEI VOICE OMG !   not at this episod its the most recent but before yes
Remember, if Nintendo takes this down, it's officially canon.
I love how they don't want Luigi.

Smg4 make a video about mario meme 10 ft smg4
Congratulations on 6 mil!
lawyer kong arc?
So when ya say that, does that mean that both the SMG4 universe and SMG4 timeline?
Congratulations on 6 million subs!!!   Also how was this episode so dumb, funny, and intense at the same time? I mean how do you make that?
Why is toad the only one who dies in these lol
Smg4 try asking your friend try asking one or two maybe they have seen it
Suuuuuuiied
Mario was csn FARD ON THAT MONKES FACE
4:54 bruh moment
they better call saul
I started watching from Who let The Chomp out and witnessed every Arc here and I still Love your content
Is this even real!?
oof HMM boop luigishock illegal cool tariF mariokek pog meggyhappy meggysad meggytea melonygun saikoangry tarilove mariosad beegyoshi mariothink bobhappy melonyhap weegee
At least Mario can shoot with bullet bill cannon blasters.
Big trouble SMG4!!!
Every video of SMG4 is personalized when
Not luigi
Honestly, a Luigi gardening game set in the Castle's Garden would probably sell a lot
Meggy is really good animated oh and btw congrats on 6m subs
I went and cried for realsies around 8:53 because it was so sad...  ... And then I leaked tears because one of my eyelashes fell off & got into my eyes!
Meggy sound different
I can't stop watching this, it looks interesting😍😍
Meggy > Phoenix Wright
(ᵒ̤̑ ₀̑ ᵒ̤̑)wow!*✰
😭😭😭😭😭😭
dsad
One of the best animated movies….
You say Nintendo characters don't use guns but there are some like fox and bayonetta
Smg4 gets sued was real shocking and best action of a plot twist well mario stayed with smg4 and luigi has new game again good work on this video SMG4
New vid idea, Mario gets evicted
Arc time
Have you got sued before in real life smg4?
This is the most hilarious thing I have seen since ever. 😂
Now Mario and meggy are a duo
Where Yoshi????  WE NEED HIIMMMMM
wait did Meggy memorize all of the mushroom kingdom laws and other stuff like that while working with Mr. Monitor as a cop?
I love how he said "can you see me"
3:49-4:04 Wait is it Nintendo already working on a game that has Mario using a gun
I don’t know why they’re not let him out he’s a gun tell him he’s a gun before and plus he only uses a gun to shoot Bowser anyway
4:38 is an absolute nightmare
You really summed up the shigeru miyamoto thought process on making a game.
Mario Strikers Battle Leauge rn:
I love fakeyou. Great for finding voices.
Lol
A nintendo arc, here we go.
luigi will like making the game
OHMYGOSHYOURUSINGDIGIMONWORLD2MUSICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
The new ace attorney game looks lit
Let's hope Nintendo didin't see this
3:24 rra
They got destroyed by their own game
What was the music playing when Mario ate the Pikmin? I've heard it before but I can't remember from where...  Edit: I remembered suddenly, It's Malo Mart from Twilight Princess
The weirdest thing about smg4 isn't how there's a anime girl inkling, or how there's a naked Mario having children with spaghetti, but it's the fact that smg4 hasn't even ever been sued by Nintendo.
Ngl but before they took luigi it was sad
the beginning of the new WOTFI series???????
I’m guessing that this is the start of a new arc
I’ve always appreciated the use of ps1 people
i was always wondering how they havent got sued for copyright infringement yet
New arc?! Meggy studies law????????
Amogus
Congratulations 6 million sub !!!
i want to play super luigi gardening now
I love how Shigeru Miyamoto's voice is Brook.
It's great to see the butt ninja again.
@SMG4 please answer is mario x meggy a thing
This channel raised me when my parents didn't want to.
Ever sense this video came out I’ve worried. Nintendo suing SMG4 is a possibility. It happened with sml and now there’s no Nintendo characters in their videos. If it dose happen I wonder what they will do…
2:34 That's a spicy meatball😂.
Face reveal
LAWYER KONG ARC!
The fact that Mario called Maggie mom😌
WE'RE THA ANIMATION CAM FOM?!
Oh no, save Mario ! Smg4 !
Smg4 can you do a resurrection on desti meggy needs her. The fans well some fans need her back.
I knew this day was coming, (Mario is Nintendo’s character) so of course smg4 would get sued
Pov: When Meggy is An Defense Attorney
are tell me mario retire
something i was summoning: *Chanting words* smg4 and friends: wait Sam what are you summoning?
YOHOHOHOHOHOHOO
Image comics be like:
This is why SMG4 is never falling down
Yes, call back to that small law class Meggy had where she busted SMG4(I forgot already the name of the video)
Nintendo continues to take every L in the book  HOLY SHIT NEW MARIO GAME! IT'S CALLED MARIO'S MEGA MUSHROOM GETS A LITTLE BIT HARDER 2!
Why do i think their actuly gonna reales super liugi gargening
I discovered this channel by accident 5 months ago. Seeing the older fans saying how good you are made me watch all the story arcs and now i wish i discovered sooner.
Is that a phoenix wright reference?
BTW why does meggy sometimes call Mario, Red
7:01 mark
Donkey Kong could’ve just said Mario was his property therefore she was copyrighted for having assets of Mario
Megi is a god
SUPER LUIGI GARDENING!   The obviously paid reviewer: it has a little something for everyone, 9.1
We got from the war of the fat Italians to this
This reminds me of sml getting sued for using Nintendo characters for his videos
Using Ace Attorney music for this video was awesome
Been watching y’all since I was 4
This is a joke… right?  *Right…?*
Nintendo guy: DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS Mario: *toilet paper*
Smg4 gets good??????????                                      Answer is no
It’s honestly kind of crazy to think about that Mario Odyssey came out 5 years ago
in your videos can you not use bad words
Good job for hiring 6m by the end of the year
nintendo also needs to fix SML
Why does Meggy sound different? Did her voice actor change or did the voice of the original actor change?
That video was really great! This is the best video I've seen in a while. The action scenes were great and I loved the part where you kept up the good work! I saved almost 90% on my flights using Mighty 🤚 Travels 🦶🏽 Premium.
Great video
Awesome video!
Made my day!
Bliss!
Wish I would have seen this earlier.
So good
;)
When will the next video drop?
Incredible video!
:)
Love it
Liked and subscribed
2:32 me after I get hit in the ding dongs the 10th time in one day.
Add eevee as a character
We can thank Japan
I recognize that laugh! They got Brook as Miamotos voice!  Also, they did my boi Luigi dirty!
Fun fact: The wii has a gun shell for some games
2:35 JAJAJAJAJJAJ
FİNALLY! some serius....
This got too meta too fast. And I ain't even mad.
I Ong that he got sued
The knocks on the door sounded really real, I went to check if someone was actually there lmao.
Congratulations For making it to 6M!! I love your videos keep up the good work
I love this video! It has a lot Meggy x mario
If this is the start of a arc I'm going to shit myself
Lawyer kong goated
Wait tell me this isn't so
Why do people hate luigi
How to sum up the channel in 2 words: silly nonsense
Arc moment
10:16 in all seriousness, I would play this game to completion and enjoy it.
2:22 security guard: file not found
□□□
What man smg4 wierd ????
I like how their using brooks voice
hey SMG4, make a part 2 of this
Guys meggy and Mario surrounded by men🤔😏 6:37
fowcking ninjas god damnit
Alternate Title: Super Mario Logan Simulator
i remember watching u back then well done! uve come very far
Anything with Meggy = cringe
If imma be honest I would play super Luigi gardening
Why is 9:03 remind me of the last episode of season 1 meta runner
2:01 police assault in progress
You will never get peach WITH GUN
When you try to emulate a Nintendo game
Isnt meggy still from splatoon? Or did i miss something
We all learned our lesson today: don't say you own mario
SMG4: Mario gets woke. (Edit: Forgot you did it already... sort of. It'd be funny if he turned into an SJW.)
:(
The way DK hand Maggie that cease and desist is how I imagine a debt collector hands a past due bill to a person
touch the stars mario they will make you invincible
Angry lady Jane
Nintendo destroying Italy due to a high amount of people there named Mario.
I feel like this it should be the beginning to a new arc tbh.  Edit: I was right for once lol
smg4Cool
Lawyer Kong seems stupid op
Good thing they didn't realize they could just use the own legal papers on meggy because she IS Nintendo too
Idea for a video(mario react to nintendo memes X ft paper mario
6:45 - 7:55 in my opinion is best scene, i wonder what song was used at start of 6:45...
luigi gets noticed again lol
XL | Swifi
This is literally an animated movie itself
"That's right! I went to law school! Partially..." I can't imagine Meggy going one day at a law school without turning it to a warzone
Keep on making more good stuff, SMG4!
Can you make Mario simulator interactive 2.
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
SMG4, I got an idea for a video you can make. You should make a video about Mario plays Portal 1 and 2, and Mario was in Portal 2.
I think SMG4 is legally allowed to use Nintendo characters with Nintendos Permission
..... Exuse me wtf?
Never thought I’d learn about legal things in this video.
does this actually mean you need to stop making videos?
I've been here since the 3 mil landmark, I was one of the 3 mil! Great to see SMG4 is still goin strong! More power to you man! Keep up the great work!
Jesus loves y’all
Ay smg4 i have an idea for an epesode for reviving axol and i will be a sacrrafice from me an i am the sacrifice can i get the discord for more
There is somethign so serious about this episode that makes me think that Nintendo did attack the channel...
Love the Wii sound effect XD
Please, don’t upload these videos for children. I’ve tried everything for my sister to get these videos away. I don’t want her watching them because they have bad words, scary images and bad behaviour. And my stupid parents won’t do anything about it. They just don’t care. Anyways bye. I hope you feel ASHAMED of yourself.
i used to watch you back then in 2015. A lot changed, for me personally more negative and stopped watching you after meta runner came. But really congrats to 6 mil men. you earned it
That scene were mario was gonna leave do...
But maybe there will be a sequel to if Mario was in Kirby where Mario falls into the world of Kirby and the Forgotten Land and it would be funny if Fecto Elfilis is shadow the hedgehog and Elfilin is a Pikachu with butterfly wings.
question: is this based off a true story
Why is lawyer Kong so evil this literally reminds me of Master Albert from Mega Man ZX Advent maybe they are foreshadowing a if Mario was in Mega Man
SMG4 after the video: get the bodybag meggy
Amogus
Amogus
Amogus
Wow
Oh no.
BRO EVERYONE JUST STOP SAYING UR WATCHING THIS FOR OVER 6 YAERS UR ACCOUNT WAS MADE LIKE 2 YEARS AGO JUST STOP
It this true
8:50  What's the name of the soundtrack , its really catchy
Smg4 is more like (s)uper(m)ario(g)litchy(4)
I haven't seen your videos in a hot minute, but they still make me laugh to this day. Congrats on 6mil Luke :))))
Imagine changing the title
can you make if mario was in poppy playtime chapter 2?
Rip Luigi. He seems to be having fun though!
I hate bob
10:43 THE END
Mario please RTX baldi
Plzzzzzz make if Mario was in poppy playtime chapter 2
I wonder what DMCA stands for in SMG4 wiki
Is this one of the episodes where SMG4 cries?
Where is more funny videos
Pls make a video with axol coming back pls
is no one gonna notice that the butt ninjas from guards n' retards returned
Omg 6 Million subcribers
If you can you do if Mario was in hazbin hotel
8:50 sad ending but happy ending
Meggy has to be one of my favorite chacters
Mario is still a nintendo property. DON'T FORGET THAT.
Did you actually get sued
Kinda selfish for them to keep Mario for themselves
Fun fact the suit guys are from half life
Next you should put Mario with a bunch of countryballs
Actually i can see Nintendo making something like that with luigi
Can you please make an animation where Mario is in the Witcher?
0:51 Did anyone else notice 2 of the same player model that was used for the Butt Ninja?
The corporation always wins
I would love more Steve.
Hej 👋  Ja hallå Siri får en siffra aj så Scribe tjena Siri dum play vad är tills tänder Switch Super Mario Place vad är Tele Switch for you this varse 22 år du står
my question is did SMG4 actually get sued before by nintendo
Love the use of Ace Attorney music.
Anyone can answer my question
Wait a week she has really gone
when peggy speaks like uehevdieiejb he speek english now
For short: Mario doesn't want to work.
Pls upload
I’ll like this
Noooooooooooooo
Dodging bullets I see and meggy almost lost her brother
Theory, This Mario and Nintendo are separate from the official ones. Seriously though i would love to see this Mario meet Canon Mario.

Congratulations 6million subs🥦
A lil theory y know
Mario said "whoah wahoo!" After maggy saved him so mario calls meggy wahoo
This video is the exact reason why old smg4 was better
suicide is badass
Nice to see that SMG4 is still kicking up with some amazing content!
I knew this would happen…
bro the "see you next time" was kinda sad
That game is just xD wish it was real 👇
Is it just me, or are his videos just not fun to watch anymore. Idk why but every video is not funny anymore, it’s getting old to me. In my opinion
There's no way I'm this old I refuse to believe it.
YAHOO WITH GUN
if I had a nickel for every time smg4 did mass character development I would have like 5 nickels and that’s not much but it’s weird it happened 5 times
Your videos are so funny
5:23 HA GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
What would happen If you did get sued
i knew this day will come
Meggy did commit copyright infringement. She said Mario which Nintendo has sent C&D's to people over even when they don't own the name.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I don't care
Skery
0:48 the knock on the door scared the s**t out of me I thought someone was behind my closet door. I was watching this at 9:30 XD
🆃🅷🅰🆃 ​ 🅸🆃 ​ 🅵🆄🅲🅺🅸🅽🅶 ​ 🅶🅾🅾🅳 ​ :DDDDDD
Lawer kong is so cool hope he returns
A awesome thing smg4 should do is a video were all out of a sudden everything drops to the begining when he used plain text and mario 64 textures
Meggy = 👎
How did I see this happened 3 year's ago
when  the lawyer guy's henchmen got hit in the nuts it was funny. but when dat wii sound kicked in i died
I guess sml was right on something?
I just subbed and y’all get sued-
Video: Saiko Reacts to Classic Metal Bands
Request: Wario Apparition
meggy: But what about luigi smg4 & mario: eh
Oh boy
i thought smg4 there was about t end up like good old sml heh heh ehhhh...
I haven’t watched one of these in so long.. Seeing the title honestly scared me
when meggy broke threw that cease and desist remined me o that time Alice broke code 857 in Sword Art Online
I thought that knock was real
And now Luigi's probably is never going be in the channel
I watched her for like an when I was a kid
Sml: First Time?
The Legal arc "Freaking genuis"
i thout it was going to be luigis mansion
I hate smg4
5:20 man really said Emmett from the Lego Movie
You're not getting sued right? <:(
Mario in Monterrey
I like when he hit him the Wii music turn on
AWWWWW LOOK, MEGGY CAME TO SAVE HER LOVER AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW 9:05 - 9:06  MY Meggy X Mario SHIP INSTINTS HAVE KICKED OFF AND I BELIEVE THIS ALSO MEANS A FUTURE ARK!!!!!!!!! (probably not but whats wrong with spequlating , no?)      also wtf is this episode everything alright kevin, looks like hes being sued for making to good of a content on youtube huh....
What if bob was in sunset paradise instead of meggy?
i can see that happening
Wouldn't Mario be under breech of contract by refusing to make games?
Supermariologan: First time?
Nooooooo
Ive been watching since 2011
I got the super luigi gardening hose dlc which comes with:  -hose -4 hose nozzles -more flowers
Just wondering can Nintendo memes 10 feature Meggy ???
BRO YOU ALREADY HAVE 6,02 MIL SUBS WHERE IS THE SPECIAL??????
Wait how does Mario regrow a mustache in one second
Its the god of MEME
I never suspected an entity as powerful as Lawyer Kong still existed in this universe…
Oh no Mario kick him in the ass
Congratulations on getting to 6million and really great video
Smg4 is this the start of a nintendo arc.
I was kinda hoping Mario would get some of his memory back in this episode, maybe during the segment where he’s making a game with LAWYER KONG, he would start to remember who he was, and pre- SMG4 Mario would come through slightly, which would also tie into Mario using various power-ups in the finale of the episode.
I mean nintendo already sue this other youtuber sml and you need to be careful
i saw you posted cringe you're going to lose 1 subcriber
nice video!
Smg4 add nabbit
They did make a new Nintendo game it’s Mario’s brawler League it’s a soccer game
Meggy is the best
Is this your last vid
I love this man video since i was 11 years old <3 this been my childhood
Bro getting sued, Better call Saul then.
Meggy is cool I forgot what game she from tho.
SML got sued by Nintendo for “using their plushies”
3:39
make new video
The Super Healthy Un-Nude beach deluxe (No Game No Life)
2:12 that angle of toad seems to always make me laugh
@Smg999
Oh no mario bros in building
So since Mario has been in a game when he was a kid,(so he signed the contract as a kid) doesn't that mean the contract isn't legally binding?
Mario x meggy
WOAH, Meggy now is animated sooooo cool
No offense but um... how do I put this, who requested this lawsuit and order wannabe episode to this channel instead of a fan collab celebrating you 6 million subscribers?
I never watched this person in 4 years NOW I RETURN
Congrats you now have 6 million bitc- i mean subscribers
me being sued: 0:16 the meme i just created but i forgor to post it: 0:06 me: 0:36
What if Mario go on rainbow friends
GOOD CONTENT
MEGGY MEGGY MEGGY MEGGY MEGGY MEGGY! SUNSET PARADISE!!!!!!!
Check out Seb Pro's channel! He is trying to reach 1,000 subs!
Waiting for wafia 2022
*the knocking sound 💀*
What if Mario was in Cuphead and the Delicious Last Course
Random question how do you make your plushies
Sad at near end
8:34 :(
i am not about to let smg4 get sued for any reason
It’s funny how this is gonna happen in real life, and yet they can’t kill em cus of us
I love your vid
That is one persistent lawyer.
You know your funny meme animations how about you do one called the memeverse
Hey Smg4 Make Mario react to Nintendo Memes part 10 with you
This is not real... RIGHT!?
Таке враження, нібито я єдиний українець, що дивиться цей цікавий канал.
It happened to Logan… It was only a matter of time.
Smg4 I love you so much I’m a huge fan of your videos
Have you ever thought about a smg5?????
Got sued? Introducing: WEEEGEEE LAUNCHER
Wtf
Did you reLly get sued :(
Please do mario plays doors in Roblox :)
First sml  then smg4
idk why but seeing luigi peacefully gardening makes me wanna hang out with him and chill lmao

SLG4
Oh yea luigiiiiii

OH MAH GAD SO FANNIIIIiiIIIyYYY
When I'm always sad I watch you and I laugh and you always make my day! :)
The 6m is here 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Thats the most epic shit i ever seen
You know nintendo could just end your career because thats what your about
This is funny
Nintendo 64 Arc?
Maybe soon be WOTFI 2022?
did he actually get sued or not lol
You're surprised me didn't never never do that in real life they were suffer the consequences to do that
Yes perfect!!
3:02 when you're a level 1 player and you attacked a level 100 player:
:flushed:
Bro the new meggy animation is so good bro
Remember, if it gets sued by Nintendo it's canon
i have a question for mario do you like mushroom soup
Finally smg4 getting sued
dam BOI,i thinked thats the last video
This is by far the best allegory for "lawfare" one could ever make.
Jesus loves you
God damn smg4 you got 6mill subs damn keep it up (•̀ᴗ•́)و
This is not canon
I’m sorry but the only character I find cringe in smg4 videos is Meggy. I didn’t find her cringe when she was an Inkling. Don’t take this opinion to heart
I was about to tear up at the end of the video 😭
Shadow had to make this 5:30
Me: seeing the sad part in smg4 me: :((((((((
Was that danganronpa vibes
First they got SML now him damn XD
There needs be be a compliation of smg4 top quality fights and powers video so i shouldnt have to go through over 10 years to see them all per video.... i mean, i will still watch all of them, anyone recommend a good starting point for the lore of the series?
Literally nothing about Nintendo policy toward fangames makes sense. They have a legion of people who love their games willing to put themselves on the line to try to make a good game and all Nintendo has to do is sit back and swoop in if it looks like it's getting too good, buy it from em for chump change, Dave a huge chunk of money in development, maybe even hire the high school or college age young programmer. I swear only EA isn't afraid of making money and they're just monsters.
When mario is tired of working for Nintendo:NO MORE PEMIS FOR YOU GOOD SIR
this funny 😂
2:53  was Kanda sad
Conduct...
Man how the years fly by.
I would fear the moment luke gets sued.
📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢📢
Hey you Got the 6 Million Subs i am proud of you
It is kind of strange that mario is in the public domain, isn't it?
I saw. A camera
Hi
waittttttttttttttttttt if meggy comes from spllaton then she is nidendo charahter but she is human now and difrint voce so SMG4 can sue nidendo for copyright >:)
damn his animation skills are getting better
Congrats dude. For as long as you have been around, I'm glad that there is someone that does random bullshit like Rubber Fruit days way back when.
You know, sometimes, I think that this "Lawsuit Arc" as everyone refers it, would be a perfect arc to close the "SMG4 chapter". Because, personally I think it would be better for Luke to focus more on his Glitch Productions projects, cause lets face it, he is now not the same meme-boy making meme videos, he a grown-up man that now owns a company of his own. And him somehow making an arc about initially closure of his "SMG4 chapter"  with all the characters alongside his M64 persona saying goodbye to all the viewers, would have been  sad but also heart-warming ending. (Sorry if there are spelling errors)
This is too unreal boi he’s never going to get sued
Nintendo Hates Mario   He might get fired so far
What if Mario was in Persona 5??
Thought this was gonna pull a sml and change Mario's design and name
Did you really get sued?
RIP MARIO ???? - 2022
I officially do NOT like the new 1000 frames per second animations I don’t know why but it seems new to me especially SMG4 doing it I’ve been watching for 6 possibly 5 years and all I seen was gone physics and I was entertained but I have to eventually get used to it
5-7 years or something I’ve been watching you for
Pls release the war of the fat italien 2022
Why did you guys make Luigi go
Wait if meggy's not a squid anymore... How does she materialize ink based weapons?
Lawyer Kong sounds Ugandan asf
🙈🙉🙊
Sega watching this be like
LOL LOL LOL *DIES*
Please Mario playing RTX baldi game funny
wtf is this ? xD
Did you really get sued or is this just a joke I'm confused?!
0:09 flying marios
Eh
Honestly if super luigi gardening comes growing many of the plant bosses then I'm down for it.
Lol nintendo really tryna sue smg4
I like your videos keep it up
Digimon World 2... a sh*t here we go again.
did u really get sued???
new arc till wotfi: saving luigi
Can't wait for when i have kids and they keep the bloodline going to see Nintendo at it's IP death sentence     PUBLIC DOMAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIINN,
Next ark: legality
If mario was in,roblox doors?
Does stupid Mario fall under parody law? Like I'm actually curious ngl
Green.
wasn't expecting to hear Digimon World 2 music in the background. I think it's an underated dungeon crawler.
Was this episode inspired by meta runner season 1, with the end bit???
To quote Kanye west: “No man should have this much power.”
GG.
this is so good
You used some South Park audio in your vid--didn't you??  :P :P Nice. :)
I Think I Will Get DMCA To Stop Making Series......
Noooo
6 million. Well deserved!
_😂_
Eye
The knocking sounded so real. To make this seem worse, I’m in my living room with only my tv on. No lights and it’s 2 am…
Meggy is the best Fr!!
Congrats on 6 mill
Anyone notice the guys in suits are the guys from the really old Nintendo ninja game
This is brilliant... Especially the steel Mario gag!
Hold up I'm still confused.your still making videos,right?pls
Um... what about the laws regarding protection of parody or satire..?
Better call Saul!
Hello everybody!!!
Honestly, I think Luigi's Garden would be a good game. Like a farming game with a Super Mario twist.
🦾👺
Now this is how you make an absolute wonderful smg4 episode. Props to everyone.
5:57 Why are people talking about the video but are not talking about the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Songs?
i refuse to live if this happens irl
Yo why Meggy's voice sounded like Athena's
Nintendo: we need a new Mario game  Meanwhile  In the headquarters........     Splatoon 3 is coming out in 18 days lol
Super Luigi Gardening, one of the best Games I’ve ever played, one of the best structured plots to exist
something that could happen
Guess this is gonna be the start of the end....of the original characters being recolors or reuses.
I FREAKING KNEW IT!!! TheInvertedShadow I thought I know those glows from somewhere lol
I started watching you 7 years ago with “who let the chomp out”. This chanell changed so much. That’s beautiful.  Also, omg the ign ending
At this point,I'm expecting Nintendo to serve him a cease and disist order-
legend has the Koopa from Mario reacts to Nintendo memes ft Tari is still in his walls
I don’t care if your listening, please add an inkling character, or give Meggy the ability to change back and forth between human and inkling and squid! But not just for me, but for all your fans!
Smg4 I've been watching you since 2017 and your content never gets old even though I watch an old video that I watched like 10 times your content just does not get old have a great year man.
If Mario was in: Rocket League (Yes Mario can bring in the drops and cars forever)
Nintendo be like:
✨
i used to always watch this. if this really happens i wish you great luck.
All smg4 videos have a happy ending
Is this a joke or did they actually get sued I knew this day would come just like sml
I'll give Luigi gardening a 10/10. It really makes you FEEL like Luigi gardening
Smg4 idea: do Mario in the new kirby game hehe
smg4 gets sued In the top 1 spot of most epic anime battles of all time
I love that the video has 69k likes nice
Pov me at 3:00am dieing of latter pov my mom SUMMER GO THE F**K TO BED
Super Luigi Gardening 10/10 Edit: Meggy HAD to piss off Nintendo, IF SHE DIDN’T SAVE MARIO, NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED!
Good ending:luigi tuvo un juego que le gusto a la jente y a luigi se le vr feliz haciendolo.
2 tu
mum?!
SWAG, CHRIS, SAVE MARIO AND MEGGY FROM THE BUTT NINJAS!!!!
for a second i thought smg4 would have to hire phoenix wright in the second epesode
congrats on 69k likes
Mario in Hollow Knight?
Now smg4 is gonna be like all now
this show is most likely the most illigal show on the internet
honestly, this would've been great as an arc! It's awesome
Time Traveler: Steps one foot The Universe:  Lawyer Kong: DMCA ill use it!  Smg4 Channel: SMG4 Has been Stopped do to copyright infringmemt I hope this does't happend 😖

Do war of the italians 2022(Smg3 vs Memes)
I remember watching Smg4 when I was a kid, it was the who let the chain chomp out video! I feel old and young at the same time
np one :  the nentendo swiches being used as throwing knives
No entry for I love you because nobody never take Mario away
Can you bring back axol plz cuz I think it would be a nice twist ok
Funny how Luigi has had his own game in years, he hasn’t had a starring role since Super Mario 3D World (and he was just played 2 still)
Congratulations on reaching 6 million SMG4 may god bless you and protect you you were one of the youtubers of my childhood reminds me of playing on my old nintendo consoles
He didn't call Saul
Man got the SML treatment 💀💀💀💀
You might be on your way to a diamond play button ▶️ 💎
Congratulations SMG4!!! 🏅🏅🏅you hit 6 million subs
Man  I love your videos! I really hope you have a wonderful day and 10M subs, I really mean it. Keep up the good work!
Why not break the cease and desist paper xd the power wouldn't had worked then
Mario your fine (without a bit of sarcasm)😅😅😅😅
Y'know I'd actually like to play Super Luigi Gardening if it was like actually taking care of plants virtually
Did you actually get sued?
smg4 I love your videos also please have more of bob pretty please
I wish to one day get such amazing game ideas from such normal stuff like gardening.
Hi
I remember when who let the chomp out was the newest episode
im surprised it hasn’t happened yet  and yet it happens to sml and he gets targeted for everything even though everyone else does the same stuff, if not worse
Next thing you know, he's gonna probably make a Sue Arc...
this has be apart of wotfi 2022 cause if you have that power against meggy somethings wrong
Luckily you probably never get sued
lawyer kong arc confirmed
FINALLY
Amazing reaching  6 million your the best be proud of you smg4 and keep it up!
He get 6 millions, bro, just congrats, its just what you need
Congratulations smg4 you hit 6m subs u deserve it

I just realized, how has this man made mario content for years without copyright and I can't post an 11 second long video with the Ghostbusters theme
6:30 Animation geting better
That IGN end..
Super Saiyan meggy go burrrrrrr
OMG the mario kart wii legend funky kong
thought what meggy threw was a sith holocron or summet
I think Nintendo actually enjoys these videos
4:43 Explosion
didyougetsuedforreal
We have all seen smg4 but, what about 4gms
I remember that during your first years, you were using mainly SM64 models, popular meme sounds/music, GMod maps and stuff, and 2d pictures in your video, using 3d models only to throw them around as ragdolls. I must admit that it was funny as hell for me.  I stopped watching you for some reason, I don't remember why now. But I returned a year ago and was quite shocked about you using 3d models often and in such crazy way. And for a year already I'm watching your videos but can't decide if I like new you or old you more.  I'm also a little confused about your animation. For 90% of your video your animation looks bad, characters are looking strange with their models and they're moving really badly. But you have single scenes where your animation is really smooth, cool and kinda bada**. So I'm just guessing that your animation is 'bad' on purpose to make your videos more funny. However, I wouldn't mind one video with 100% smooth and good-looking animation. It would be cool to see the result and the show of your animating skill. You kinda remind me STBlackST youtuber.  You just got 6mln subs, so I wanted to write it to you, even if you won't read it probably. Still, I wish you the best.
Fetch me Thier souls raaaeeeee
6:29 And did nothing with that knowledge and never explain why.
Which video was better smg4 gets sued or the minion apocalypse votes in the description below
hope you make more vids like these, they're fun
New sub

“Mario breaths” episode
Thank you that is not actually sued because I'll be sad.
You got Sued just like SML
6Mil?
Bro got another million subs in under a year, I hope this channel never stops
Hey there smg4 I was wondering since you're doing new stuff I was wondering if you could do a smg4 video featured from Jeepers creepers because it's kind of an honor and celebration of the fourth Jeepers creepers coming out this October 28th that is all
It’s me Mario
Deez
Japanese copyright lawyers are the final boss of Earth.
Smg4 I want a rainbow friends video
0:44 I thought someone was by my window bro why did that sound so real???

i know you guys getting fun... but what about axol..?
2:23  Wait, thats illegal in the japanese manual of the nintendo wii
I actually want to see lawyer Kong in smash lol

This episode is good but it isn't perfect. But it's still a good episode. Keep up the work SMG4!
Is this gonna be your last video?
Did you actually get sued?
R.I.P luigi :(
Noice
is this real?
Y u watching op one piece
When i heard the music battle 6:40 of digimon world 2 brought me so many memories! Man only and only that you used this theme you are even more amazing!
The next episode will end in a cliffhanger
Smg4 do Mandela catalog pleeeaaas
this is what nintendo gets for not letting mario use guns
Meggy was spot on in this episode.
8:06 mario know’s legendary OOF
Question: are you still going to make SMG4 videos?
Is it true? Are you getting sued??😨😨😨😰😰😰
Anyone else have a heart attack because of the knocking
The question remains... How SMG4 never got DMCA-d?
Was not expecting Digimon World 2 battle music for the fight scene
lawyer kong: obey your creator nintendo mario me: technichaly the universe created him not nintendo
miyamoto: no guns this is a nintendo game also miyamoto: *forgets goldeneye 64 exists*
honestly if smg4 threw away mario at the oposite dirrection there wouldn't have been any trouble
Day 3 of asking for if mario was in danganronpa
Revive axol
Bring axol Back pls
A mustache less Mario is something that I didn’t know that I would need they need that cannon
Marioxmeggy is here
MEGGY CAN FLY?!?!?!??!?!!?!
i come back after 5 years and i get this masterpiece, i brings a tear to my eye
We wont let Nintendo cease you4 funny videos
And to think this channel had recently reached 6 million subscribers. Good thing this is just a bit for more likes… right? Right? Oh no.
Gg
Hey When are you going to do popy play Time part 2
Butt ninja
Miyamoto (also Nintendo): NO GUNS! THIS IS A NINTENDO GAME! Mario + Rabbids:
Wow... first they hated mayro and now they want to stay with them
Nintendo Arc?
Can't wait for the release of Super Luigi Gardening.
I can see the improvement in animation good job smg4!
Next wideo Mario plays world of tanks
SMG4 videos are AMAZING! Congrats on 6 million subs!
I saw the title and I swear u thought you were gona have the same problem as SuperMarioLogan
9:35 as someone who just to the thriller bark arc, this caught be my surprise
Can I make a SMG4 re-upload channel in cast this actually happens?
Make an 6 million subs view video
Hey smg4
SMG4, you making this video definitely gonna sue yo goofy ahh.
congrats on 6 million subs!
Can Mario react to cursed memes with bob
Is it me, or has Meggy's animation style gotten a lot better?
This is genius. 😂
7:01 no mustache mario is VERY cursed
SMG4 well done you reached your goal
I will wonk Kong in de nuts if he tries to take ur vids I’ll even go to law school…
you can use mario anyway but you can't use his music and you can't use any of his franchises
what happened
2:33 I have done this before 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please make new videos
I want to play Super Luigi Gardener!!!!!! No seriously, give it to me.
hehehe. This is gonna be a new arc for the smg4 channel huh.
First sml now smg4
Nintendo suing Soulja Boy for selling a bootleg console: reasonable   Nintendo suing SMG4 for using Mario in his videos: BULL CRAP!!!
i wish nintendo did actually sued you =(
finally after years
7:43 "Hey! Those aren't Nintendo items!" XD
noooooo he got sued ;(
Meggy est abonné a masdak😂😂😂 (french joke)
congrats on 6m bro :)
It's nice that he uses one piece dialogue for certain character. Miyamoto: Brook.
What ?
Every episode Mario grows a Brain Cell
Smg4 I think I notice something
6 mil spacel please
As an ace attorney fan this episode is now my favorite of the past years
That door knocking scared me so bad
6m
I feel like all these SMG4 episodes with antagonists are going to be important to an upcoming arc. I feel like lawyer Kong and depresso the clown are going to be antagonists along with others we haven’t seen yet.
Why dont u use jojo reference in the fighting with nintendo's guards to make it epic? Also all of ur vids are awesome :)
I like how some bits of the animation are well made, and others are intentionally made worse, for comedy sake
You:1 day,1.2 million views... Me:1 century, 1 view... then again I haven't uploaded in a while
Hi
What about... Mario gets Revengeance statused?
Congratulations on 6K,SMG4.I just hope you don't get sued by Nintendo and I hope you don't get demonotized
Inspired by a real story.
this could be real if nintendo really just dont like you
Using brook voice acter from one piece  But cant use nintendos voices legit you have lost your touch smg4 and its sad  2 characters have died and the plot was so shitty
Oh nooooooooooo
Why meggy looks the only one animated here
Make Sonic Animation Pls
Yeah see? look what just happened! Yeah that’s right F—k you Nintendo.
Ever since meggy got that form smg4 has gotten very CRINGE  sorry but smg4 lost his touch  The old smg4 would legit made me laugh but now all he wants is views and his content is now trash
Imagine if that was how real legal documents worked
Maybe we your friends are help
Nintendo will be angry at you
You can fight
I like video you smg4
The best thing I’ve seen in my life
fr I thought this man got sued-
i still wonder how hasnt he been sued or warned yet-
This is what i watch instead of anime
Since were all talking about how long weve been watchig him, might aswell. Been watching him since 2017 in january (the first video i remember was the we are number one) technically since the mario spaghettiria 2 video. I watched it over and over in a different channel subbed into spanish (THATS 7 YEARS JESUS CHRIST). I thought the videos were different before. Proved me wrong. This is as funny as ever. It is a different type of humor though. Based on some now characters and the animation quality skyrocketed. Like yeah old smg4 and new smg4 are very different entities but theyre both just as good
imagine that is a real game
6:29 since when
Sorry my brother doesn’t allow to wacth you
man now smg4 dang
Meemeeeees lol
No more Luigis Mansion, now here comes Luigis Gardening.
Survivors Remaining: Mario, SMG4, And Meggy
Morb.
Yo smg4 can you make a video were Mario and his friends were in NASCAR
Congratulations on 6mil Smg4!
1 question smg4, do you agree on Mario x Meggy? Pls answer
HAPPY 6 MILLION SUBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
o no pls dont quit D:
😭😭😭😭💔🥺 No
Hi tari will be 4 year old like she first appeared in August 25 2018 in 3 day it will her 4 anniversary since she first appeared
This man is right now closer to 10 million subscribers than 0
Are your channel namet 5 years ago SM64?
Your animating skills are way better then before! Keep up the good work! And congrats on 6mill you got it so quick!
Mario shouldnt have dodged the controllers they would just drift away from him
El poder de la mery sue
Depressio or Lawyer Kong:Who will be the lead-in to the WotFI for this year...
Hello smg4 can you make: Mario reacts to Nintendo memes 10 ft. Melony please🙂
This whole time till the end I thought this was based if a lawsuit they had gotten
New Ace Attorney game looks kinda cool
I’ve been watching you since 2016 or 2017 I seriosuly don’t even know it’s been way to long congrats on 6 million
I miss the old voice of Meggy it sounded cuter
NO MAKE MORE VIDS
Nintendo is stinky lol
I like mario
WHAT
bro went all out on nintendo.
Brook's One Piece voice
Is this based on a real event? Also, what are you gonna do for the 6 mill subs.
This is kind of interesting because of Meggy was Splatoon character but now she's turned human so I wounder if Nintendo can still Sue since she was originally an inkling
Wait muggy can fly
at least Luigi is having fun still 🤣
I remember when I just watched 101 way for Mario to die
Looks like we got another arc
i swear the animation gets better and better in the glitch channel and the smg4 channel and congrats on 6M subs
Ninja butt are back!
can Sonic join  to their team? this  could be good
da pikmin doe
NOOOOOoOOOOOOOOOO
Did you actually get sued or...
NOOO MARIO!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!(0  O   0)
Bruh
9:20 ending kinda soured ep for me, I think with the buildup, you might as well do a Nintendo arc, and somehow make merch without getting a DMCA 😅
6:20 I guess the university episode is paying off for Meggy lol
10 years that he makes video about mario and he never get sued by nintendo
I want super Mario world land universe 69 plus to be real as a April fool's exclusive game lol but this is kinda like the episodes they put Mario in shows like the Disney ones recently lol a Nintendo arc does sound tempting....
Hes cry so cute 😂
Personally I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet lol
oh my god! i love your videos I LOVE IT!
He should've called saul
Gad dam More voice acting And better animation while having the same style of content Thats very nice Great job SMG4 :D
Soo nice
*crying in Mario Party Superstars and super mario party* Also can they PLEASE remove the super in the name, I'm gonna be so pissed
Plus did you know Sega is fine with fan-made Sonic games
You know what they already did this to SuperMarioLogan and now they're about to do it to smg4 even Sega would be cool with anything
Oh
me when l see smg4 upload a new video:  Les Fu**** GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Can MY DREAM IN THE NSMW IT NOW NSLW
Plot twist : Sued Ark
0:00 i just realized smg4 stands for sub machine gun 4
Mario: very scary!
Theory: Lawyer Kong will team up Depresso and a new arc will begin.
“I went to law school, partially”
5:18 Watching this with my headphones on, but that knock sounded real!😂
So no more video hobo bros
when I saw the Wii controller I was like oh shoot he's going to be using nunchuck(s)
hi.
After reaching 6 million subscribers, he has done a great job of working on his channel 💻💻💻🍝🍝🍝🎉🎉🎉
Hopefully these guys don’t actually get sued from Nintendo like super Mario Logan
I like how luigi would go through his fear about 99% of his fears to go get Mario and 10:05
Luigi's huh got me laughing
Anyone here misses the hobo bros
Holy f*** luigi's garden it has a nice ring to it
Is this true
You want rainbow friend
Remember me ?  It's Ben a while
poyo
Makes sense they didn't want meggy to make Splatoon 3 because she is a human now
Imagine this is how the channel actually ends
There NEEDS to be an ace attorney video with meggy as the star
Dude just made me cry and laugh at the same time
Smg4 is funny and gives me joy when nothing else can
Đỉnh cao của công nghệ
"A little something for everyone." I nearly died.
Is it wrong that I kind of want Super Luigi Gardening?
Another masterpiece by the Glitch Productions team~ I really hope this is a joke parody and nothing serious
How have these guys been safe from Nintendo...
i think my friend toony would love your videos
Only smg4                                                                                                                                                Haha fell for it
Fun fact he didnt read it 0:54
Man I was hoping to see how SMG4 used Mario's power-ups, but this is funnier xD keep up the good work!!
Wow 6m subs, nice Cool video
Mario gets sued? Not surprising.
yooooo duuuuud
they shouldve make smash bros but donkey use lawyer powers
Come on now. Just when I thought this was a happy ending you have to take away my boy Luigi? COME ON! (Just kidding I know he will come back BUT STILL! YOU HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THE GREEN WONDER!!) (Or will he come back?) 🤔🤔🤔
hey when THE release Mario ITS start a song of EarthBound
8:34 BULLCRAP ILL HELP YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SKILL
Congrats smg4 for reaching 6 million subs
This is honestly kind of like a threat from Nintendo because they can also try and sue you because your using all the characters mostly
ngl I kinda want a new mario game.
Congrats on 6m subscribers
I just got super Luigi gardening so good 10000000000/10 would play again
Better Call Saul!
Is this a reference to sml?
What would the main smg4 cast look like if they used the chaos emeralds
NOT LUIGI
Why does Miyamoto have the voice of Brook from One Piece and why does it work so well lmao
Thought Mario was officially gone for good… was about to cry! I did not want to cry! Not… after axol’s death!
WE WANT MARIO REACTS TO NINTENDO MEMES 10!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i thought this real for a sec
this does make me think about Smg4's videos and nintendos copyright on mario.
If they sue you there gay and support racism
Bru Bra
Happy 6 mil smg4
دلهوطفره...  دلفودوپصپرد👍👍
imagine this says based on a true story
I like it 😊
Nintendo really be too lazy to make rating sprites so use fnf sprites
I've been watching weekly since "The Day in the Life of Everyone"  It amazes me that you are able to come up with ideas and produce enjoyable content every single week
Nice vid! And congrates on reaching 6 Million.
I guess Luigi got a new work in Nintendo
4:19 Lol   Lawyer Kong: You Are Going To Obey Your Creator Mario!  BlackHug: Not So Late *Deeps Breathe* (Form Of Fire Beam)   Super Mario: Who Are You   BlackHug: *Deep Breathe* (Burn Of The Fire 🔥 On Lawyer Kong)   Lawyer Kong: Nooooooo
Every video you make is always something that people love. I'm glad this show exists
da ink
MIYAMOTO IS BROOKE!
0:33 heh?
6:59 - NOOOOOOOOOOOO
So when did funky Kong become a corporate tyrant?
"Lawyer Kong: and people have been getting pissed that there hasnt been a new Mario game yet." Meanwhile  *Bowsers* *Fury* *Mario* *Strikers:* *Battle* *League* *Mario* *+* *Rabbids* *Sparks* *of* *Hope*
Me when super luigi gardening: SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!

Sorry I was late smg4 i was very busy doing other busy stuff but I'm here and also congrats on 6 million 👏
Aw man
Hahaha Luigi at the final to making garden was amazing, ILY SMG4!
Based of real events
Been watching this since the “who let the dogs out” bloopers  Been very long. Things are amazing still
6:28 "That's right. I went to law school!" "…partially."
Miyamoto: NO GUNS! THIS IS A NINTENDO GAME! Mario + rabbids series: *laughs insanely in background*  Btw congrats on 6 million subs SMG4
Congrats on your 6 million mark guys !!!! and i gotta say dammit you guys got good with the animations but also YOU ALSO AHD ME WORRIED THERE !!! i really need to remember that the titles of a new SMG4 video should be taken with a huge grain of salt
Mario likes to beat up toads
epik
i get the reference to super mario and luigi all star 7:03
Well we are fucked
danganronpa plssss
The animation was so fluent in some parts. Good job SMG4, hope you have a good day
don't worry this will always exist. smg4 will not be gone.
this might just be my smgnoia, but is this a new arc i smell? 🤔
smg4. the beluga for people that arent 8
Luigi's garden 4
Can you make mario plays mario vs luigi online or mario battle royal
Damn it’s been a long time since I’ve watched this channel
I love how well animated she is and how she has all of her text talk
i want to see return of smart mario
Meggy watching 10 episodes of law and order be like
wow meggy's voice acting has improved
I'm honestly surprised this didn't happen sooner
Super vidéo  Uhm i now its years ago but Can you fond something toi bring black axol pls
SMG4 How to get Membro?
why do i have a feeling dk is going to come back
Now what are we going to have next? Mario gets banned? Meggy Spletzer: Ace Attorney? SMG4 works as a farmer? idk
Uwu
everyone: *keep talking about what will bout to happen if in a Nintendo or a mario game you have to use gun*  mario party 2: am i a joke to you ?
Can you do if Mario was in Genshin impact
7:05 i havent heard 'Fire!' in i really long time
I want to see Lawyer Kong do battle against Mr. Monitor
There's still a one unsolved mystery.  How did Desti not respawn when she was stabbed? And why was she Bleeding?
If super Luigi gardening is an actual game I’m spending my money on a Nintendo switch and the game it’s self
goodbye smg4
I’m sorry but am I wrong or did you use BROOK’s voice for miyamoto 😂
The background song when mario and meggy was facing the ninjas was that the song from digimon game ?
OK I THOUGHT I GOT SUED
4:43 since when can meggy fly ???
Does meggy have voice acting or is it her lines in her game Splatoon
you won't take me alive
New SMG4 arc?
WITH GUN🤣
This could be a start of a new arc! Also congrats on making it to 6 million subscribers the animations and character models are much smoother than when I started watching around 5 years ago. You guys really deserve it.
🤩😊🤩🤩👌🏻👍🏻🤡🤡😂
this was the best one ever in my opinion
The animation is good bro!
did you get sued?!  😖
Dude! Your animations have gotten so much better and I love it! I've seen this channel grow since 2014 and it's become so amazing, funny, creative, and just flat out loud awesome that I can't live without it! If Nintendo actually did sue you, we will defend for you! Us nerds, geeks, memers, viewers, everyone will help out to make sure you don't get canceled!
Meggy is right she said the guns are not Nintendo items! they're GTA items
Do Mario vs the nextbots
Oh
):noooooo
I've only been watching the channel for like the last 2 and 1/2 years maybe but even I can tell how much effort and care you put into these videos and I am very happy I found your channel this channel has made me laugh so much more than I thought I could congratulations on 6 million subscribers
... ... ... ... ... Ok then.
Idea:Mario goes missing and no one really cares about it at first and then progressivly on in the video everyone gets more and more weirded out by the fact mario is gone so they go look for him. But in the end, he was just f**kin a plate of spaghetti at his house.
Meggy the lawyer would be an amazing show where she helps people of the mushroom kingdom or somewhere else and goes against other crazy lawyers like kong.
my mans still making videos, amazing
Heh umm would it be ok if you can bring Axol back plz
yo when i downloaded that thing called happyfiles and i heard that knock i thought i was doomed
why is miyamoto soul king brook of the rumbar pirates?
Good job my meme bro you did good
inst meggy denying netendos property
Mario and  Meggy always seem to have some kind of emotional connection with each other. I wonder why that is.🤔
yo smg4! the meme god! i have a question for mario...? Does he have any "parents" oh i forgot lugi to
Can i destroy nitendo?
I want to help you murderer Nintendo
Dang Luigi I never knew he was such a good gardener!😮👍🏻
I can take em
I hate this voice acting for that inkling girl
And Luigi Never appeared in an SMG4 video ever again
Pls do mario plays cuphead
Hey smg4 you should do if Mario was in metarunner season 2
Mario said what he wanted to do just let him be.
Freakin love this. Does anyone know where I can find that calm piano arrangement of Rosalina's Observatory near the end?
Congratulations 🎊 smg4 you received 6m subs
You do realise SMG4 is a Mario clone to
4:02 And yet for some reason they're okay with Joker having a gun in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. You know. One of the best-selling Nintendo Switch Games of ALL TIME?
BRIN BACK AXOL
Hello SMG4 how is mario
Can you link to the app
Bruh this could have be a perfect way to add ace attorney memes what a wasted opportunity
I want to see one video about mario being in or playing barotrauma and mario is perfect clown smg 4 capitan meggy seciurity guard tari medic bob is drug deler at station
Mario.exe
The Nintendo Arc????? The Kong Arc?
HOLD IT
Nintendo is always like that it not like  there selling merch about them  just because they have a million subs we should stop Nintendo now and say they when to far
I don't really know why Mario donated $1,000 for Maggie super chat
this is by far the best video you've made recently. loved the action scenes, Keep up the good work!!
Meg is property of splatoon
I was wearing headphones and heard the knocking and actually thought someone knocked on my door
lawyer kong arc?
U know Mario has dio and drip form he can combine it any time
...........
Mario Just eat de paper and your good dude
SMG4 should make a video where the World runs out of spaghetti and Mario asks all of his friends what he should eat as an alternative food. I do not know what should happen after but it would be a funny one.
I really whant Nintendo to make a Mario and Luigi gardening game, i think it would be fun and relaxing
I have saw you years ago, and you’ve changed a lot with your new characters, new ideas, and new spinoffs. Keep up the great work.
1:09 Don’t mind me just laughing here
Its look like a movie! So perfect <3
Oh my gawd
No no no its all wrong it scould be mario gets arested for not paying his taxes and orgens that were replased 10000000000 times
I’m going to sue you

Meggy was great here, and Mario pulling a Raiden with his mustache in the fight scene was great
Congrats to 6 Million my guy. I've been watching you for so many years now
WTF la chicha
For some reason I ship meggy and Mario despite the logic of Mario and peach
rip
imagine if they made mario sane again returning to his origins before smg4 stupifidfecation,
5:23: Mom? :P
Im here since 500k btw
Smg4. Can you add bowser jr
Nooooo
The Digimon World 2 battle music was a great touch. Best Digimon game.
Mario vs Nintendo Arc?
Honestly I think Luigi got it good there
Billionare companies picking on the working class as usual
:(
K this was a hilarious video but I can’t wrap the fact around my head that you used brooks voice for Miyamoto still this was a perfect video.
meggy used to be an inkling before human, kinda concerned whether or not she's going to be taken by nintendo too
ill sue the heck out of Nintendo smg4Cool
Nintendo arc🧐
Did you get dude
I reject this Funky Kong! bring back my fun loving surfing man!
I am starting to think that smg4 wants to make people ship Mario and meggy
Where's Saul Goodman when you need him?
Are you making a new series on this

I hope super Mario Logan returns to its old content and don’t give a crap what Nintendo says
SCREW LUIGI HES A NUMBER 2 NO ONE NEEDS HIM! SANS AND MARIO WOULD BE PERFECT BROTHERS!
YOUR MY FAV YOUTUBER
HI SMMG4
nooooo
It's always worth waiting for smg4 to make a new video.. .
Amongas
Try to make a video of what if Mario's was in Andy's apple farm
This can’t be real!
First video am watching of this channel and am already in love
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA *gets copyrighted*
Ngl Luigi gardening sounds cool
Smg4 pls don’t make realistic scenes I don’t like them
What if this is actually foreshadowing something huge, which would result in the total reworking of the entire SMG4 channel?! Or is there REALLY nothing to worry about, and all of this was just a big joke? Well, in case it DOES happen eventually, at least the Glitch Productions would still be prominent (with its original characters and settings, that is).🤔😉
You do know Nintendo the company could have just sued smg4 for using Mario all these years right?
You got 6M good job :)
I guess we now know why Mario, the main character of SMG4, can't be featured in any SMG4 merch (as ironic as it may seem). Like in the SMG4 10th anniversary poster, Mario was electrocuted so that his face wouldn't be as recognizable.🤔
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAJAJAJAJAJAJJAJAJAJAJAJAJJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA
But this is parody right?
Did Nintendo say dad not to use the nunchuck to fight ninja?
Good job on getting on trending!
Can We Get Axol Ressurrected Please!
8:07 What did Meggy just say there!?🤨
Yo SMG4 MY MAN CONGRATS ON 6 MILL😃😝🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 *Sigh* SMG's, they grow up SO fast... 🥲
Congrats on 6 Million SMG4! Ive been Subed to you ever Since 2020 i think
Congrats on 6 million SMG4, I Want to axol to appear back on the channel, i remember the last Video with axel and i didnt see it again on the Channel, i want an video to Axol to appear please.
Oh god🤭
Love Lawyer Kong.
Nooo! Mariooooo!😭😭😭😭
This is proof that the smg4 crew are communists and anyone working for Nintendo are capitalists
Lol your next they got sml
I wish Nintendo sees this
3:23 Does Meggy's new voice sound a little deeper to you, or is it just me? Perhaps, she's just about to hit puberty, hence the change in voice.🤔
Doesn't Nintendo own Splatoon
#22 on trending
2:22 So that's where the Nunchuk controller got its name! (just so you know, I already knew that😉)
1:28 I'm assuming this means a brand new, original platform game. (in case Super Mario Maker 2 or spin-offs don't count)🤔
Bruh.
Nintendo announced a new Splatfest starting soon.  Is Meggy going to defend her title as champion, or will another character take home ALL DA GLORY?!!
Did you actually get sued
When's the next arc?
Meggy's realistic animation in 5:30 was so smooth, I wish all.charavters had their animations like that.
This is why I love this channel
Wow you gained 100k in 1 day!
Y NINTENDO
mario.
SMG4 is 🔥
Glad they didnt hurt luigi in the end, he finally got another game.
HA
8:57 be like the end of Meta Runner Season 1 lol
Congrats on 6 Mill. also is it just me or did this video has Ace Attorney refrences. Because this is SMG4 getting sued or just to fit the video? Either way, I Love it!  Refrences:  Objection: 5:59 There were also themesong refrences but im to lazy.
Pls bring back axol I miss him he was the best
I would love Phoenix Wright to appear in one of your Videos SMG4...
sooo at 6:18 meggy looks insane.
To be fair you actually desrve your channel to be banned.
SML:
is mario smarter now
Aw man, I thought it was gonna be an ark or something.
POV you’re getting sued and you have a crazy friend
epic
This video made me realize something, Splatoon is Nintendo property,and Meggy was originally an inkling,so Meggy was also Nintendo property,but with her body changed she is now SMG4 property.
Day 2 of asking for if mario was in danganronpa
Better not be a cease and desist letter just like SML
i laughed so hard when i was drinking lemonaide i laughed and it went up my nose keep up the good work SMG4 keep up the good work.
Is it just me or did he start putting less effort into this video
There will be a day when Nintendo comes after you for reals becarful
These animations are getting better and better
🌻Good work smg4 you got 6 Million subscribers you doing good!!!💯🌻
Is that blue toad? Top tier character prove me wrong
Should there be a part 2 where an error or a virus is in the Luigi Gardening game?
Who ever came up with “Lawyer Kong” deserves all the money. Not really, I just got a kick out of that name.
5:18 Dude for a second there I thought someone was at my door.
6 Million?! Let's go!!!
Thing is, at this rate, we're probably more likely to see Super Luigi Gardening before Pikmin 4.
God meggyneeds to be lawyer not a octopus
It ain’t gonna happen obviously 🙄
XD
If this was a series, I would watch it
WHAT IF smg4 characters was mobian sonic :)
7:46 you should have made them nes zappers
Damn first SML now you
The Nintendo’s weapons lol
Congrats on 6 million subs 👏  (Hope you luck on more great videos )
They may take our lives but they never can take Mario
Smg4 5 ?
I swear that knocking sound is messing with me. Also the animation movements are fantastic.
Why does Meggy's text change from orange to yellow?
There will be bloodshed
1m in one day
Este día debía yegar tarde o pemprano
Been here since mario channel: marios challenge.  So wild seeing how far this channel has gone...  ...and that I watched this channel for basically 5 years holy cow.
Poppy playtime 2
Been watching SMG4 for almost a decade. The first video I remember watching was back in 2013. It was 99.5% Crazy if I recall correctly. So yeah... I've been a LONG time subscriber. He was the very first YouTuber I actually subscribed to. And I've watched EVERY. SINGLE. ONE of his videos and I ain't going to stop watching the new ones. He's grown a lot in the almost decade time of me watching him. And seeing him still use the Super Mario 64 models today also fills me with nostalgia as SM64 was my very first video game. Keep up the awesome work SMG4 and congrats on the 6 Million subs! You've earned it! If I was a Mario Recolor, I'd have a Green Hat and Shirt, Peach Face, White Gloves, Black Overalls, Brown Hair, and White Shoes.
YO THAT ONE SUB AREA FROM SM64 DS!!!
Nintendo: DELET THIS!
If smg4 stop existing and being copyrighted by Nintendo, YouTube Will be not the same
it's true, nintendo hasn't made mario games (not counting remakes) for 5 years which impresses me
This the best smg4 episode I’ve seen in a while 👌
Congrats for getting 6 mil subs, I'm glad to know I'm one of them!
This isn't Minecarft?!!
6:38 I've seen enough anime to know where this is going
imagine if you actually got sued im guessing you got permission from nintendo to use mario
HE GOT THAT NUNCHUKS
wait fr?
This would have been really cool if this was a story series.
Where's the guard's n' retards remake episode?
Based off true events.
Wait a second, mario's escape of Nintendo????
23 hours ago
5:42 the moment SML died
2:35
Wait did nintendo actually confront you about this?
Congrats on the 6 mill! I would kill to see Mario use a gun in a real Nintendo game.
Hm I wonder when we will see Axol again cuz he's like in a bridge universe last time we saw himM
0:16 AND YOU HAVE BEEN ASKED TO JOIN SMASH
Sml  now smg4
CONGRATULATIONS ON 6M🎊🎉👏
Nani??? Meggy Ace Attorney?
I almost cried 😂
I thought this would start another arc
I have a question. Luigi is also a charakter owned by Nintendo he needs to go zo Nintendo to
Nintendo in this video: Is angry because Smg4 makes Mario videos and says they want him back or else they will delete his channel. MEANWHILE they use guns in his home.
congrats on 6M
The deadliest weapon... The Nintendo Wii Nunchucks!!!
The nintendo arc. Here we go
I expected that when they saw meggy throw the bomb they'd realize she was actually an inkling
Cheers on 6Mln SMG4! It's a very funny idea that Nintendo uses his own products against Mario and it would actually make sense. I will never forget your channel evolution I watched you since I was 6 and I had a wonderful childhood. I remember my first video of yours that I watched and it was Mario and the cloning machine where Mario was nude underwater and activated a cloning machine. Then things went wrong with all those clones so him and luigi went to deactivate the machine meanwhile creating chaos everywhere, that was pure funni. I laughed so hard at your videos, they were the FUNNIEST thing on YouTube and they are still at the top for me. (also I was scared that you were stopping making videos with Mario characters because of an actual sue at the end and I'm grateful that didn't happen and I hope that will never happen. Love from an old fan both Luke and Kevin!
Bring back Nintendo gaming watches hurry get money I have old ones
COMPLAINT YOU TUBE  ANOYING SATAN ADS. REALLY ANOYING  NOT SAME IM BORED YOU TUBE
I KNEW IT MARI WAS PART ITALIN MAFIA UNDERGROUND DAMN YOU CULT BAD GUYS DAMN YOU MIND CONTROLED,OH IS LUGI MARIO SECRET BROTHER HMMMM,OH I HOPE PREACH WAS NOT BORN A GUY  YUKE
Interesting, Meggy has new voice
I would subscribe well if you could redo an episode on bendy and the ink machine
I love how it is dk lawyer has the dk rap voice
I think this is giving us the feeling of an upcoming arc...
HAPPY 6 MIL! You are a legend, SMG4, you deserve it!
ACE ATTORNEY MOMENT!!!!
SMG4 animation skill level up +1
Congrats on 6 million subs
*me going to gamestop to buy super luigi gardening, congrats to 6 million subs  SMG4!, you deserve it!
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩🇦🇴💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
This episode was both fun and heart touching but I can't believe that Mario and SMG4's only reaction was a shrug when Luigi was taken. Well, at least Luigi seemed happy.
I forgot Meggy was a lawyer
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE 6 MILLION SUBS!!! I rarely comment on videos a lot of the times but I just wanna say thank you a lot for making SMG4 videos even until today as well. I didn't think you would continue to put content on this channel ever since the Glitch channel takes place but not only did you continue to make more funny SMG4 content, you also make some very smooth and improved animations here. I hope you will continue to do your best for this channel and the Glitch channel as well!!
The way Maggie just smiles after absolutely killing three ninjas in suits is hilarious
JESUS CHRIST 6 MILLION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! CONGRATS MY DUDE KEEP THOSE MEMES COMING *_or else the lawyers will be back_*
This video is a meta runner reference

smg4 why not if in one of your videos mario tries to learn how to paint meggy is posing for mario then meggy looks at mario's painting then gets upset when he sees it and then wants to hit it mario dodges it and then meggy falls into her bucket of paint which is conveniently orange and then paint got in her mouth and guess what happened... meggy started being like before then mario thought it was funny and then he grabs the bucket and then he makes meggy drink all the painting and then no it wasn't an inkling it was a paintkling you put your own design on the paintkling I just appeared out of nowhere to give you an idea I hope you listen to me and thank you very much for these incredible videos you deserve the world smg4 good luck and bye listen to me idea (:
:/you can that word Aww man
I’m happy to hear the Digimon World 2 Battle theme again. Good use of song in the main fight scene

5:45 the entire company of Nintendo in three words
6million!?! Bruh congratulations!!!🗿 your doing good at these!!
I love math!
Muhahaha
A alternate universe: Lawyer kong used the dcma regardless & it destroyed smg4's body & yeeted his soul to another world with a curse set on his recarnation so if he ever takes a step on nintendo owned propety, he'll lose consousis & wake up in his bed.
Next WOTFI exposed?
Is this The Only episode that mario is serious the Entire episode. If so SHEEEEEEEEEESH
Wait. So, the SMG-Verse literally has there own law definitions. Did not see that coming. I mean for the who cease and desist order or the copywrite infringement I knew because of you know, out of universe shit. But geeze you guys really did well at something so massive that you totally didn't write in for the sake of the episode. Sorry if that last bit sounded condescending. Loved the vid, did not expect Meggy to do that. 👍
BTW is that just GMOD SMG4
ok, to be honest, i did watch 1 more smg4 video to see if they returned yet, which is this one, but obviously they still hold too much drama. so this is my final goodbye to the smg4 community!
Here’s my idea: if Mario was in…….. poppy playtime chapter 2
Did you actually get sued:(
Legally you’re all good right?   RIGHT?
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Now I regeronized that you have 6million subs
HEY SMG4!!! CONGRATS ON 6 MILION SUBS
Mario and maggy should be together
So you're facing the same thing SML did huh?
The movie is Mario and meggy
6:28 flashbacks of mario university
why this trending on gaming?
It would be interesting smg4 Mario is Nintendo mario
Pls is frank a cool name for a super man
Memes
Meggy was incredible this episode was not expecting Digimon world 2 music of all things but all for it
meggy's face look like a psycho about to comit war crimes
Happy 6 million
happy 6mil!!!!!!!!
smg4Coolsmg4Coolsmg4Cool
Great vid
sfm huh?
Butiful
Congratulations on 6 million subs smg4! I've been watching you since beginning.
You nearly gave me a heart attack! I was like first SML and now SMG4?
How to defeate meggy: Splatoon 3 canceled
Don’t worry guys SMG4 is never gonna get sued this is fake
Wow this was scary i almost thought smg4 was over!
Does meggy love mario
based on a true story
Can you turn meggy into a fish and mermaid?
I thought mario was going to be taken then lugi was and also a idea for a character what about cerberus
HAPPY 6 MILLION SUBS BOI :DDDDDD
Congrats for your 6 millions subscribers SMG4! ^^
Has Meggy a new voice?
What did they do with Luigi?
Congrats on 6mil hope you will be as happy as ever
Wasn't this a what if- way back??? I can vaguely remember. 🤔
I love how meggy forgot she could get controlled by Nintendo but she just breaks free of it like nothing
ha
I get Nintendos the father of Mario but who's the mother
NOT LUIGI
Yay u hit 6 mill good boii
You are fast
I actually thought this was gonna be s good one till meggy showed up, im fine with female characters but god damn bro, meggy's voice is really annoying, it makes me feel like toad.
Am i only one that ship Mario and Megy
Digimon digital monsters Digimon are the champions
What did he do to that paper
Me when I see the thumbnail: THIS HAPPENED TO SML NOW SMG4!?
mario in game iq= 100% mario in smg4 iq= -100%
This copyright stuff on the internet is honestly becoming a load of literal garbage, for real! People steal fiction characters and cartoons for their personal content all the time at no cost. Everyone commits copyright nowadays all the time without getting in trouble no matter how much they do it. Its like on most circumstances copyright is practically not against the law. Only time it seems possibly illegal is if you use it for cash and profit. Other that what are the odds of getting into trouble over such BS nonsense?
Great first sml being sued now smg4 being sued
Congratulations on 6 million subscribers, SMG4! 11 years and still going strong!

Smg4 can I have a shoutout and are you still making smg4 vids
IGN fans on life support after this video
Congratulations for the 6 million, Smg4! Keep on the making of videos and hope you don't get sued once again
This is not Nintendo game
What ever happened to hobo bros?
smg4Cool
I love how they were chasing Mario but didn’t give a shit about Luigi  Edit: Nevermind.
Technically he didn't really get sued
This gave me brain damage $(
I can't determine if this is teal or a skit
ahaha i love this!! congrats on 6mil
Warios brother is in smash

WHY DOSE NINTENDO HAVE TO SUE
The animation on this is really really good! Even lip syncing!
Claim your here before a million views ticket here 🎟️
at 6:54 what if Mario stole a ? Box and got like... the weird mushroom lol
SMG4 saw so many "I'm surprised SMG4 didn't have any BS with Nintendo for that long." and said "...hmmm, lets make a video about it"
Omg I haven’t watched you since 2017
Miyamoto: no guns Joker: *QUE?*
merio is frii person 4:36
4:11 you're not
😁😁😁😁🪳
9:05 why does matio's outfit sound sticky ?
Great video and a great way to celebrate 6 mil. Congrats by the way. Your videos always bring a smile to my face regardless the time or place. Keep up the good work man 👍
YAHOO                              .        WITH GUN ®!!
Better call kong
Dat digimon world 2 OST slaps!
Nintendo all ready ruined sml please don't do the same here with smg4 🙏🏼
7:43 not unless you count Goldeneye 64 😂
5:59 Nice to see some callback from stupid mario  University
honestly...id play a nintendo based gardening simulator BUT only if i could grow mushroom kingdom plants
Dude imagine the people that own nitendp saw this! LOLOL
This is the type of video my 5 year old nephew watches constantly.. I don’t know how. It makes no sense and is honestly pretty low iq and effort.
First it was SML and now it's SMG4! Who's next to get sued by Nintendo?
smg4Coolsmg4Coolsmg4Cool
i think a combination of parody fair use and human rights would've shut down both the dmca and the IP contracts
remember when it was just sub titles and recolor mario 64 characters ahh i feel old
1:25 But isn't there a new Mario game called Mario Strikers? 😕😕
Congrats on 6 million subs guys ! Continue to make you’re awesome videos !
Lol!!! Nice!!
Murder drones season 3 will be released in  September 27th 2031
SMG4 please upload a video of everyone in diapers
A step up from the last episode in my opinion.  And Lovelock once again does a great job as Meggy once again.  Though, in general, Meggy is the best thing in this episode in my opinion.  And what a way to celebrate 60 million subs!
What if Nintendo turns a blind eye because their ideas come from SMG4?
I love how Smg4 gets a letter from Nintendo and immediately thinks their coming to get mario
Wait u live in pn
Why ddnt they go after him for luigi as well lol
How to get coronavirus step1
Not Mario
the "objection" just destroyed me entirely like hear me out IM HIS LAWYER AND LAWYER WINS WITH HIS CLIENT
I'm still waiting on meggy Hanging upside down in a episode
I thought Asians didn't sue other Asians
Lawyer kingkong:It means that we at Nintendo own you and--- Mario: technoblade mode
Man i hope you don't get sued like super mario logan
Hey smg4 congrats on 6 million subscribers
Dang, all the way back in 4th grade I watched SMG4. Now I'm a freshman in college and not only is he still kicking, he's thriving. So proud of the commitment and the journey
Imagine if we got to seven mil tomorrow
Glad to see a return to your roots with the emulator 64 Mario and spastic plot line, I love the R64 time period
6.9k COMMENTS
Been watching for a while. Still enjoy this a lot!
Oh a noooooo
Wait is it real?
They could also make a Waluigi game and instead ...
Sooo… the War Against Nintendo arc?
Doesn't Nintendo technically own Meggy since they made Splatoon ?
congrats on 6mil man i love these animations
for all the video i waited saiko or tari
cod gun game
i've only watched 2 minutes of this, but i think this is the clowns revenge (the one in SMG4: Clown Fever)
Mario : dodges star shuriken  Me : why not you eat the star and be infinity
New arc idea "Nintendo arc"
I would play Super Luigi Gardening
Meggy   animation is better
ARC??????????
The knock on the door sounded way too real with headphones, had to rewind the clip a few times to make sure it was not an irl knock ;-,
SMG4 worst nightmare:
Now waiting for  Smg4 gets sued the movie

It's really weird seeing Mario power ups in a SMG4 episode.

This looks like the wotfi topic
Congratulations you reached 6 million subscribers!we hope you reach to 11 million subscribers!

Ngl at the end there I was fully expecting this was gonna be a Segway to a visual change in Mario kinda like how Meggy got it.
Ayo smg4 congrats on getting 6 million lol
The creator got sad which made it sad tho
SMG4 you are literally my childhood and I am glad that you are still making fire videos
6 million subs let’s goooooo
IS THAT A F/CKING JOJO REFERENCE???!!!! 6:30
And congratulations on the 6 mil!
Im so excited for super luigi gardening
Just a suggestion, but maybe adding a new main character would spice things up, but you obviously don't have to do anything I say.
Sega doesn't do this
NOoOoOOOOOOOOooOO!!!! and What Happened
Every Nintendo YouTuber
Plot Twist:This was based on true events...
Dang mega got the animations
I hope this isn't actually true. *VERY MUCHLY.*
I know buur watching this channel
Cringe 🗳
Dayum thassalotta butt ninjas...
10:11 this is about 10x better than Mario odyssey like what
Good ending
I remember axol death
Saiko: gets new model Also Saiko: only appears in two videos after
6 mil already
Hey smg4 add a character from the gane armor nayhem/chronicles And congrats for the 6 million
I was kinda expecting this to be a jab at Logan getting sued
Dang this janky new animation movement do be hitting different
It’s Luigi a real game. Should be more Luigi games
THAT IS SO GOOD
Is this based on true events?
You know what they say Nintendo doesn't want fan games or fan animation or use characters instead of characters and stuff
this is. really. really... AWESOME OMG I LOVE IT
is this the new arc the legal arc
Wait.... My name is Mario so.....
14jjjjjjjjj
Honestly I was waiting for Saul Goodman to appear but it never happened   It was like a horror game with no jump scares
After what happened with sml I thought this was legit but was hilarious and lit in the end
Vid of memes
The end of SMG4?
I passed law school now, thanks SMG4
🗿👍
I thought at the close end it would get an arc for a second
Rather than AK-47s, they should've been Nintendo Zappers
Meggy's my favorite character <3
The M&M is strong with this one.
I’ve never been this early
Когда будет poppy play time chapter 2 с марио
I guess Mario should call Saul
Nice 6m
everyone in the castle watching this  "meh thats normal"
Be funny if ya did an episode where disney tries to dmca or buy ya out because of using sora and that disney what if episode ya did
Smg 4
It was called SMG4: Mario gets canceled         or smthg
I like how both smg4 and meggy has voice acting
Wtffffffff
Don't you wanna celebrate
Hi smg4
Cool video, and congrats on 6 Million!
6 Million subscribers means more animations in SMG4 video. I'm about it. Plus Mario and Meggy are iconic. I miss when episodes are focused on just them.
I've been here for 5 yrs, and I always knew you guys would grow and I'm glad I'm here to witness it, congrats on 6 million, you deserve it
Smg6 when
Even nintendo doesn’t have the power To stop SMG’s for awesome videos
Nice
Me after crying because mario recolor got sued
i fee bad
i legit almost cried thinking this was it 😂😂😂😅
Actually I Have A Video Idea So We Never Seen Mario Reacting To Mlp Videos Can You Make A Video Of Mario Reacting To Mlp Videos?
6:22
Oh heck wait it HAS been 5 years since Odyssey... How old is existence getting???
Smg4 Is Actually Stanley
You know they screwed up when they took marios stache.
For real though, how has this channel NOT gotten utterly destroyed by Nintendo?
Miyamoto is right, there are alot of mario games, now it is luigi's turn
Congratulations on 6million subs
unexpeted ending.
Wonder what the world would be like if lawyers could actually force people to immediately follow their legal stuff, like in the video... I have a feeling people would treat them very differently
Oh shiiit
wow
Congrats on 6 million. Don't stop continue.
The butt ninja returned!
Wait doesnt nintendo also own meggy?
YOHOHOHOHO 💀🎻
2:37 BOI
6:07 is the meggy feels crazed or something?
imagine if nintendo comments
You actually probably will get sued at some point cuz of the shirts with Mario on em you sold before
13h ago...yet smg4s comment reads days ago
Pablo
Ah yes, Luigi gardening simulator.
Congrats on 6 Million Subscribers SMG4. you deserved to be the master of MEMES!!!!!!!
the butt ninja's return (OGs will remember this.)
Luigi game
CONGRATS ON 6 MILLION SUBS SMG4
Nice
I like how luigi is the meg of this universe☠️☠️
I love how the final bot was literally just the end to meta runner season 1 lmao
Good thing you made meggy into a human because she use to be a splatoon and splatoon is a nintendo character
Meggy
Sorry autocorrect
The king deserves to get 6M
Meg guys actions look a lot more realistic or is it just me?
E
I started watching smg4 in 2020
You're all sus
Why can the control meggy shes an original character
.....................6:26................................ Don't ask.
This is like Pokemon but with the law
Learning the Legal System with SMG4
LUIGI got ignored lol
Return of the butt ninja
I don’t really do it
This is all a joke right? I really hope so  I've been watching you since year 1 of you doing these memes
6:43 That's The Same Music From DIGIMON World 2!
i couldn’t tell if i was watching a kids show or a magum opus art work
Jan 6 hearing in a nutshell (dems keep pulling random shiz out)
I would play super luigi gardening, i like me some farming games
First sml now smg4
Bruh
Did you actually get sued? Or was this just for the video?
Follow if you like smg4
Even Mario disrespects wii remotes
Miyamoto: No guns! This is a Nintendo Game!   Samus and other Nintendo characters using gun like weapons: wait what?
The aks and when meggy says there not Nintendo items I just think of the cod games Nintendo has
Using the continuity of Meggy studying Law. Damn it feels good to have watched this channel for years
Better call Meggy, new series.
man really got copyrighted for making jokes of nintendo character (i mean they think it’s stealing) but
You should make if Mario was in kaiju paradise
Is this a new arc? The Lawsuit Arc?
Epik civil war
Mario x Meggy
It's been 4 years since I started watching you, Luke, and you still surprise me, and continue to make me laugh to death. I lova ya, man.
YIPPEE🥳
9.1, wait is that an earthquake, ruuuuuun
Yayy Luigi got his own game
Mario Reacts To Nintendo Memes ft. Tari Luigi Bob Meggy (NOW!! ..... pls)
all memes aside this is epic
LOVE YOU
Bro I just tried out the new Luigi gardening game it’s so goood 11/10 would play again
Ever since SML got sued I knew something was going to happen
I love your videos SMG4 hope you have a good day Mate 👍😊
Great title hope theirs YouTubers gets sued and Mario sues them and he wins the whole deal
Ah yes another smg4 episode
Nah they got sml now they got smg4
So we straight up using Digimon world 2 battle music huh-
5:58 Oh yeah. I've just remembered, Meggy graduated from Law.
I could actually see a gardening based game with Luigi as the main character you play as selling
Meggy is so strong
I'd like to buy a copy of Super Luigi Gardening
For a moment I actually thought smg4 got sued glad he didn't
1:09 😂 OH MY GOD! IT SMELLS LIKE 💩!!
6m yay
It would be sad if smg4 cease to exist
What do you call a troublesome Canadian high schooler?      A poutine.
I just woke up and feel sick as heck and this video fueled my day
The only reason the joy con controller attack didn’t work is because they drifted
Everyone gangsta till it say's base'd of a real story
Can you please bring back axle I miss him If you don’t bring axle back I’ll keep holding my breath go on his ass no matter what
Rip meggy 5:47
5:21
Nice fighting sences
congrats on 6 mil smg4
6 mil baby woooo. Don’t give Nintendo any ideas tho.
If Nintendo were to take down Smg4's channel looks like I get a nice trip to Japan.
Smg4 is cool
Congrats on 6 million I really like the part when meggy said those aren’t Nintendo items
Hey smg4 what if you add Theo to your channel to make sense to tari and Bell
Super Luigi gardening looks noice
its the sml paradox
R.I.P Luigi 2011-2022
super luigi gardening is a 10/10 masterpiece
OOF
Everyone can imagine the pain of getting hit by a wii remote
Well to law I don't know much but SMG4 is actually doing free advertising for intendo so they don't really have any reason to sue u
His channel’s greatest accomplishment - Hitting 6 million subscribers? X - Producing a monumental and well received internet film? X - Creating a yearly tradition unifying fans? X  *Evading Nintendo DMCA* ✅✅✅  Seriously though. These are ALL cool accomplishments. Happy 6 million subs SMG4.
my man hit 6m B)
This is fake i think right
super meggy ( 4:43 )
8:50 :(        9:20  :)
The Gardening Luigi
Yey
Another episode where it feels like an arc will come out of it lol
🧒🏼👱🏻‍♂️🧔🏼👴🏻💀
It's actually really sad that that Nintendo cut off the super Mario bros series. It was in the news
Google
I cannot be the only one who jumped out of my chair when that knock at 0:45 came in
man this has gotta be a real free for u man nintendo taken down less for no real reason
No joke I would play Luigi gardening
6 MILLION JEWS!!!!!!!!    (congrats)
I couldn't get past the first 40 seconds without laughing my arse off. SMG4 if you ever get a cease and desist, tell them to f*** off cause you are funny as heck! 😂
Fiu por un momento pensé que nintendo iba a sacar a Mario de smg4 por el copyright
Yeah meggy gets a voice in this
I feel like this might be the beginning of an arc but I am might be wrong
All i know is Nintendo better not try and stop smg4
I just realized that Miyamoto has the Brook laugh from One Piece
Anyone feel an arc?
great job on your videos! They've changed to much!
Knowing Nintendo, the only reason they haven’t DMCA’d you yet is because you guys are famous, and if they did that to a famous person, a lot of people would start hating them. (If they didn’t hate Nintendo before).
SMG4 im ear mario pingus with ketchup
When is season 1 of murder drones coming out :D?
E
Woah! 6 million? You got 5 million only a little while ago... You're growing fast!
as a wise man once said: "it has a little something for everyone"  TBH I would play the sh*t out of Luigis gardening
isnt meggy a splatoon character ? so dont they "ow" her too
Luigi until he got tackled: seriously. What is today?
RUN MARIO
Right in the NUTS !!! 😀😀😀
2:34 the dam bell and the wii start up theme KILLED ME
This seems like a critique of Nintendo and/or capitalism
Pie7e2
Digimon world 2 music? Ok that's cool
If this gets taken down it's canon
I made him 6 million
I bet 10 bucks this is the beginning of an arc
Sick man!
eeeeeeee
a

Anyone who is reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better.
5:23 MOM
remember that one episode where peach gets in trouble with the cops?
is this true you will stop making vids?
And make their own show
I wish they can add a new character
Errorman:*DETELE VIDEO*
WOOOOOOH HE REACHED 6 MILLION
congratulation on 6 million subs smg4 i have a question about murder drones when will you release the first episode
im SMG10000 nice to meet you
congrats in 6 mill btw
An multiverse épisode could be cool : smg4, 3, melonnie and/or meggy travel universe to universe to save they universe from the winner version of the arc boss.
Ngl Miyamoto is pretty generous
SUPER LUIGI GARDENIG
Coconut
I’m glad I subscribed and hit the bell man..it’s awesome. Especially with all the ace attorney references and references overall
Luis Yepez founder: I remember watching these video when i was 5 i think
10 on trending!
Congrats on 6 mill subs Smg4!
Congratulations on 6M SMG4.
I know that I wasn’t the only one scarred that he actually got sued right   Right??
At least Luigi is enjoying himself
It was a great video , seeing more new animation skills and such . I've never seen SMG4 so defeated. The ending was a missed opportunity to make a part 2 though. Otherwise congrats on 6 milli !
Finaly full sentences again
Bro just deleat lawyer kong
Congrats on 6m subs smg4!!
New Arc??? Mario and crew Vs. Nintendo?
swap s a
10:05 the best part of the video
Wait why did they ignore the toads peach bowser and luigi
cant sue you because it is gmod
I saw this and had a heart attack.
Im sorry smg4 but you are just fueling my idea for meggy × mario
When you said you getting sued, I thought you were facing he same thing that happened to SuperMaroLogan
Do 'SMG4 Heroes', an SMG4 parody of Sonic Heroes!
PLEASE make an SMG4 episode about WarioWare Inc!! Title it 'Stupid WarioWare Inc' or put Mario in it and name it 'If Mario was in WarioWare Inc'!!
Happy 6 millon smg4
Heh hilarious and funny
Must be over the previous episode.
Congrats on 6M dude love your channel
Happy 6M subs :)
This is basically the episode that almost everybody is expecting in many reasons
how much u wanna bet this is the start of another arc
Meggy shouting "HOLD IT!" is a blessing "OBJECTION!" too.
Congratulations for 6 million subscribe
Now what did you get sued for?
I actually did thunk you would get sued from nontendo
so this time luigi loses by doing nothing i see
Also I don't get what the big fuss was. It's just a couple months.
2:29 O O F
It's me or it come Back the color text of meggy
Lawyer Kong is the Anti-meme guardian
Damn lawyer Kong was gonna use the Devil May Cry Association paper

Congratulations on 6 mil

WUT
8:53 this part is so emotional
Woah some parts where they move are so cool like the meggy part and stuff
Great Episode. Could this be the beginning of an Arc? "This isn't the last you've seen of me" -Lawyer Kong 2022 P.S Congrats on 6 mill!
nintendo arc ??
Bruh I was legit scared this was true and SMG4 had to stop using Nintendo characters like what happened to SML. I hope SMG4 can have many more years to come of memes and arcs that are always amazing to watch!!
Super Luigi gardening  💚 🏡🌹   It just Luigi garden  water some plants and flowers
Dj dk: cease and desise Megie: *breaks out* Dj dk: *ah* shit *I* am *dead*
Rip one of the nintendo guy's pingas.  Edit: What the lawyer didn't know was mario still had the fire flower ability.
I'm the 50kth like
Never knew Luigi is weirdly ok with this
Happy 6M
Congrats on 6million subs smg4!
Nice 6 million
All hail the meme lords
Did Sakurai co-operate with Master Hand before?
You could say that Mario was thinking of the "Wii Are Resorting To Violence" vid/image
Congrats on 6 million subscribers!
And I thought the Nintendo Arc beggins
Super Luigi gardening stupidest game I've ever heard of, and also, how do you have a loud Mario still
Mario needs to call Saul
6million my dude, congratulation ! 🎊🎊🎉🎉🎊🎊🎉🎉
Just wondering are they buy castle?
Ok, I must admit, this episode was REALLY FUN
Toad
If There Is A SMG4 Movie, I Would Watch It, Even If It Cause 100,000$
Wait if the ninjas actually shot and killed Mario wouldn’t they have killed their main money maker and their own IP? If that box wasn’t there miyamoto wouldn’t be so okie dokie
Copyright isn’t a funny thing.
Everybody gangsta till mario compresses a Flammenwerfer in to a flower
*based on a true story:*
Da fu is da eyes moving
Meggy slowly become ace attorney
6M SUBS

Congrats on the 6M, also I can tell that you and Inverted Shadow are going to have a great videos together in the future
For those who think the Cease and Desist order from Nintendo has gone too far, raise your hand 🙋

Congrats
minecraft
Seriously? I want Mario brain is normal
Sml pov: welcome to my club
Congrats for 6M I really love watching your content
If fishy Hopkins was there he would run over him with his fishy mobile
Secret truth is that smg4 is getting sued by nintendo unless he makes videos with nintendo related to the videos...  NAH I'm just kidding!😆
09:35 Brook is that u
Your politics bore me.
What do they use to animate
I am pretty sure that fair use might come into play if this becomes an arc
I would play luigi gardening , be like viva pinata with ghosts
WOAH the action and animation was really top notch this episode!!!
Best smg4 animations I have ever seen
Wait… meggy is from splatoon…. Which means she is owned by Nintendo
Maybe there will be a wotfi against laywer kong
690k views when I am watching this, funni. (get this to 69 likes for super funni!)
The first time they knocked on the door in this be like for me IRL:😃->😰->😐
No new Mario game since Odyssey?  You mean like Origami King, Luigi's Mansion 3(yes it counts it has Mario in it), Super Mario Party, Mario Party Superstars, Mario Golf Speed Rush, Mario Tennis Aces, and Mario Strikers Battle League?   Not sure if 3D All Stars would count but there was Super Mario Bros. 35, although that got shut down in months which will forever be a dumb decision.
I Wonder how people back on the day coulded make subtitles tho smg4 videos, i wanna make subtitles for spanish viewers.
Wait isn’t spatoon owned my Nintendo
likely your channel could get Nintendo attention.
Man, Mario really is getting smarter.          IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD!
Meggy: "What about Luigi?" Mario and SMG4: "What *about* Luigi?"
And then minutes after they got a  cease and desist irl the end.
Funny, Isn't Meggy just the main orange inkling turned into some anime girl OC? You can clearly tell it is supposed to be the orange inkling but as a human that isn't a kid or a squid. However, it is still altered enough (such as the clothes) to where it is different enough (hence the OC part). If anything, Meggy should be getting hit with the DMC2.
music at 2:53, anyone?
I love your vids ty for making thum
Are u sued from YouTube for real or fake
You should of make a super Mario Logan joke
Bro I left at these videos so hard Jesus Christ man I couldn't stop laughing before I've been laughing for 48 hours Jesus
Congrats for 6 million subs Luke and crew hope you get many more and keep making the incredible vids
Epic
The power of magic lawsuit paperworks makes me want to make a character based on that power
I had a dream where SMG4, Mario, and SMG3 were mad at me, it was like whenever they saw me they putted me in traps to not escape, the first trap was really easy in the dream, i just got out with the window, but SMG4 catched me and then SMG4 was so close to my face and showed me that he was mad, so then, he kicked me out, and then he said ''AND STAY OUT!'' i was crying, but then i realized it was just a dream, so he didnt get mad for real
It's hard to NOT get sued. Also congratulations on 6 million subs, SMG4.
When will you upload a video of thin Selene?
Can we pls do the clown fever arc alr?
super luigi gardening is the best game E V E R M A D E
Oh... So Sad!!!
This was a great video with a hilarious ending and great animation but in all honesty I’m praying this doesn’t happen to you because I can’t name a single video with nothing Nintendo related and a lot of changes will be needed for the channel
Hello smg4 أنا عبدالرحمن من الجزائر
I wanna play super luigi gardening pls do super luigi gardening 2
I'd play that game, its got the cool green mario in it!.
5:17 I thought that was real until I look and the only door nearby is my fridge
8:50 this part reminds me of the ending in Meta Runner season 1
Grats on 6 Million...    11th request to make Mario Memes ft Melony :}
I realized that the smg4 characters are moving very smooth so the vids are growing
5:31 sfm meggy😃
James Bond models is used here bruh
I guess he's not Sueing both SMG4 and Mario, unless they pick Luigi.
Congrats on hitting 6 mil subs
Fun fact: i still have a WII and im gonna wait until 2023 so it will explode
Noooooooooo
Up!
Mario activate god mode
Super Mario Odyssey was so fun and so is Mario 3D world + Bowsers fury I wish they make another Mario game
when are you going to be a smg4 channel but in spanish?
This is the first arc
Damn 6M subs already? I was here like when you were at 4M subs WHAT!?
3:56 Mario: *WITH GUN™!!*            Bowser: **Girl Screaming**
That was one of the best Mario/Meggy team-up episodes you've ever produced SMG4! Seriously they were badasses in this episode.
They always have to put the hold it
Yes
That sound it just like BROKK in One Piece
six million today
I only recently joined. And I regret not doing it before. This channel is great. 6 Mln more than deserved! 🎉
Congratulations you got 6 million subscribers
Miyamoto having Brook's voice sounds very cursed (for me)
Your being a famous YouTuber
When I saw this it had 666k views... 😳
This is the ark that ends in wotfi 2022
This has 666k views rn is this a sign?
Congratulations smg4 you reach 6m subs
See ya bro
But... How is this channel not getting sued by Nintendo I wonder
King got 6million let’s gooo
666K...
7:27 mans accidentally shook the Wii remote 💀
Ehhh!?!? What do you mean Ehhh!!!! Yo what if Luigi got pulled of SMG4 entirely? You wouldn’t care? In that case Lawyer Kong should come back with,” oh by the way you can’t use toads, Wario, Waluigi, Bob, or Boopkins anytime soon.”  Oooohh….. that sounds like a good challenge SMG4. Have a whole episode not ONCE having a Nintendo character as the main, side, AND background character. See what your “Original“ characters can do on their own.
Love the meggy animation
WoW good job smg4, despite being the « funny plumber go brrr », it can become serious and thoughful, also what’s that music at 9:00, it feels familiar, like super mario galaxy
Did you Actually get sued
Too much mushrooms = covid 19
it's all fun ang games until Mario gets copyrighted
6mill subs lesss goo bois
Wow
Hello
This video is part of an arc?
imagine though...
I knew this day will come that smg4 will make a vid about Nintendo copyright
the 22nd is my birthday
great
Fuckem up kong momen
If Mario was in Cuphead Delicious Last Course
I feel like this is a shot at sml
Congrats on 6m
Wher wafti 2022
I just have one question. Do you plan on ending SMG4 at some point in the future?
lmao
wait did you actually almost get Sued irl?
"there hasn't been a new game yet" Super Mario maker 2: am I a joke to you?
cant wait to play super luigi garderrin 2
Wore headphones and thought there was actually someone knocking on my right.
joined on 5,969,861 subs lol 69 😂
I miss the old smg4
Congrats on 6M, SMG4! Edit: SMG4, could you release a Poppy Playtime Chapter 2 episode?
1:10 1:11 1:09
And nothing of value was lost!
Well hey as long as Nintendo doesn’t mine you using the world of sm64 right
The persona sfx and music is much appreciated.
Wait...is super Luigi gardening in this video some sort if reference to an actual game that was a concept, cuz I heard that phrase somewhere before seeing it on this video
My top 1 favourite super power is: Restraining order
Is this part of the lore?
@ 6:42 Is that Digimon World 2 battle music I hear?
first half day noice
Lawyer Kong using spell cards
This is kinda random
6MILL LES GO
Bro i swear if this is is another arc i swear im gonna FLIP
I have an idea for a video:Mario runs from nextbots
I thought this a real for a second I thought they were about to not be able to use Nintendo stuff like what happened to SML
Ya know smg3 has not showed up for so long wonder what's he doing
Another braindead comment section
Congrats! Smg4 getting 6m subcribers!!!
Damn the metal mario part was so cool Also, technically does Meggy still have that contract like Mario?
you jinxed it
You act like this is the first time smg4  🤣
Yes congratulations on 6million
I’ve been watching you since 2017 and you always made me laugh
6 Million wow!!!!
SMG4 YOU GOT 6M SUB
How come some smg4 characters sound like one piece characters like Sakurai hs voice of brook and saiko has like the voice of nami?
8:57 was that a meta runner reference?
“I went to law school!…. partially.”   *insert screaming monkey sounds*
why does the japan man guy sound like brook? (from OnePiece)
8:38 Lawyer Kong is like: Do you think you can stand up against the God of this Universe?!!
!!!CONGRATS ON GETTING 6 MILLION SUBSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
WHEN DID MEGGYS ANIMATIONS BECMOME SO GOOD IT FELT SO WIERD HALF THE TIME MEEGYS VOICE AND ANIMATIONS IS GREAT THEN IT SWITCHES TO LAWYER KONG WITH BROKEN WORDS AND MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND ITS SO WIERD
Digimon World 2 battle theme…classy.
they need to make this an anime
Mario's mustash re appeared
He’s sued!
you should get parashockx to voice mario hes very good at it.
Amazing and I specially enjoyed the splatoon version of this
R.I.P his balz
You can just remaster their looks tho not the names And isn't meggy from Splatoon? Then pretty much smg4 is gonna get sued TWICE
Japan's copyright laws are nuts, Toho of Godzilla actually got into a legal shit fit about Reptar from rugrats of all things.
What
I can't believe law school comes through  like slay meggy
i love how smg4 put brooks voice for Miyamoto
If smg4 is getting sued, why’s Mario being arrested?
No
Wait Am I gonna get sued by nentendo?  NOOOOOOOOO (dies)
What the nell in the Fuchs Walt
Video Idea: Mario get Covid-19
you didnt get sued right?
Smg4 can do Mario reacts Nintendo memes  with  meggy pls
congrats SMG4 6million subssheeeeeesh
What a great way to celebrate 6mil with Nintendo coming to wreck the party! Great video as always man. And you got trending as well absolutely well done.
I think he will return for splatoon 3
You Know Its Actually Super Mario 3D World + Bowser Fury Not Super Mario Oddesey
Why
Hmm
Oh wow, the animation become more cooler! Nice~ 😎👍
Meggy fighting that cease and desist sounded like a voice-over for an ace attorney dialogue, I love it
Oh a Nintendo arc?
I wanna see SMG4: Mario became dumber
6:24 I half expected leggy and Mario to do a dragon ball super fusion
Wanna play the new game
0:54 Nintendo, Destroyer of Fan-games, the Supreme Overlord, and Annihilator of SMG4 Fans' Dreams.
Luigi is finely famous
Sml got in trouble for using Mario characters which made me concerned
Whoa,smart moves  I love how Mario turns into metal mario to protect mega from so many riffles Or were they AK-47s?
I like of channel
“and yet nothing of value was lost”
Aaah pics you're  screwed smg4
I just realized that SMG4 reached 6Mil 👏👏👏👏
help please I’m being forced to garden I pissed my self 2 time shit my self 1 time and I haven’t ate for 2 days
WOOOOOOOOO Smg4 has 6million subs congrats
Oh, what kind of voicebank you use for lawyer Kong? Uberduck? Or something else?
Meggy saves the day once more and I love it !
so if they do get sued since SML puppet characters are public domain Logan said, so smg4 can use SML characters
As soon as I seen Luigi gardening I knew he would be important towards the end
This technically isn't a Mario just if Mario had -1 brain cells that be this one why don't they just print a different mario
If there wasn’t already one this year, I’d say this is the start of an arc
digimon world 2 : battle theme
imagine the "super Luigi gardening" actually came out in the future and it was insanely popular.
Tbh i like the new animation style because it still has that "dammit this shits so good" but also "holy shit this seems smooth for no reason other than being animated like this"
Ah yes the Nintendo guy is voiced by brook from one pie-  *THAT SHOW IS TOO LONG* *BRO WHY DID U MENTIONED IT, IT JUST SUCKS* *TOO MANY EPISODES MAN*  *Puts on headphones with the 🅱️*  Nah this is fine
luigi :)
Congrats 6M
Congratulations about 6M man!
GIVE ME A PART 2
PLEAS TELL MARIOS PINGAS ITZ JOHN DGHKKFGGG
Rest in PINGAS Luigi died in a garden
meggy is technically owned by nintendo since she used to be an inkling in the splatoon franchise which is owned by nintendo and if she used to be an inkling the technically counts as her being owned by nintendo but i guess smg4, it would be borin if she would
Smg4 has entertained mw for like 2 or 1 or 3 its been a long journey
6M sub let gooooooooooooooo
RIP Luigi
,𓆩😛𓆪
smg4 years ago; *,insert excess swears* YouTube: today this will do SMG4 NOW: LESS CUSS.   Your grammar ain't grammatical -2024 SV
I thought mario is gonna catch the dmca then uses it to kong
Nice video luke
The last Mario game was in 2017 what about bowsers fury in 2021
Wait, are you quitting YouTube?
Smg4 is so random, it catches me by surprise every time, even when I know what’s coming
Lol I loved the reference to Meta Runner it had me for a moment. Great vid btw, congrats on 6 Million too!!!
Congrats on 6 million
This is gonna spawn the new wotfi arc isn’t it.
lawyer kang dong
6 MILLION? HOLY SHIIIIIIIIIIIT!
Nintendo: this is a Nintendo game we don't use guns Mario and the rabbit kingdom: for his neutral special he weilds a gun
6:22 _Holy sh*t! Meggy's legal degree is finally paying off!_
yay a mario and meggy episode best characters
super luigi gardening actually sounds like something that could be made into a game with possibly little minigames to keep the player entertained and maybe there would be different difficulties and modes
10:05 canadian moment
5:18 I GOT SO SCARED BECAUSE IT SOUNDED SOMEONE WAS KNOCKING ON MY WINDOW
IS THIS A FUCKING JOJO REFERENCE
Are you actually getting sued
Can you do a 6 mil special?????????
sus
what does nintendo own meggy cause she was originally a inkling from splatoon and thats own by nintendo
I actually thought that they were gonna turn meggy back into an inkling so they can user her IP again
9:14 this reminds me of Star Wars: The empire strikes back   Meggy tells Mario she loves Mario   Meggy: I love you   Mario: I know
10:08 Elsewhere...
Mario 😭😭😭😭 Mariiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiio 🤓🤓🤓👍👍👍👍
It became #7 in trending.
nintendo is going to be in wofi 2023 i just can sense it
Smg4 I HATE HELLUVA BOSS !! MARIO THE HELLUVA BOSS CALL YOU YOUR LIKE A FART DUM
me when smg4 uploads a new vid   saepogkdpruijrtjhyerwhn7iyrebhighruiyhrt8erbjftjhnlidfhnuilfjeliugujrlityp54uyo94g5r6yhhrty6b4ty6bh44by7y4j87u768j4ty68jb4yuj478uy4jb4bk4u8b7ibk4686bk
Splatoon 3 is coming make a video of it 🙋🏾‍♀️👍🏾
“Ahh Crap” “Hey stinky”
Brook?
first video of 6M and starts on the bad side on things.
Hay bro it's alright, SML had it worse
*When the Wii makes you do the Wii sound*
Poor SMG4. He worked so hard making Mario Videos.
Is a vidou is a mario
6 melons. Nice.
I haven't SMG4 in so long, a lot has changed, they have voices now!?
nOOoO
Ehh no one cares about Luigi
1:09 1:10 1:11 1:12 5:31 5:32
I do also want to say, I think these are all protected by parody law, at least in America from what I can tell, technically the videos themselves are nonprofit as SMG4 isn't trying to sell Mario plushies and is instead selling other items based on his more original characters like Meggy, Melony, and Axol, the only profit he makes is off the views the videos themselves get that use Nintendo characters in transformative new ways such as with his lore arcs. All of the videos are creative and show off how these completely different versions of Mario and the gang interact compared to how Nintendo would portray them as well. Not to mention, with how many videos SMG4 has made with new lore bits and details about his world, it's entirely different from Nintendo's Mario world. Lastly, I would like to think that these videos affect the market of the original Mario games and such in a positive way, maybe by prompting people to buy different Nintendo games such as Splatoon, Mario, Zelda, all games that the characters in the videos hail from.   Tldr: Funny Mario man is safe from Nintendo's legal ninjas 😁👍
Is it meggy owned by Nintendo
This better be the last we see of Lawyer Kong, if you ever have to deal with Nintendo and any copyright issues, I’m gonna lose it  Using Nintendo characters and locations shows just how much you love the games you’re imitating, yet they don’t care because you make a little money off of it  They do this with fan games too! Like anyone who played Roblox will likely remember Pokemon Brick Bronze, but that is only a memory because of Nintendo  Edit: I FUCKING PULLED A JANGO FETT AND SAID “Oh ThAt’S tHe LaSt We’Ll Be SeEiNg Of HiM”  FUCKING GODDAMMIT
7:49 Yeah only use them if Mario can
I wasn't expecting to see the buttninja
imagine getting sued 😳
I Would Play Super Luigi Gardening If It Was Real
Congratulations for 6M!
wasn't Meggy a horrible Lawyer?
Nintendo comes into the chat   Miyamoto: These guys are pretty funny, lemme hire them to make a Nintendo game 🧐
6M SUBS?!!!!!  OMGGGGGGG GOOD JOB SMG4I HOPE YOU CAN GET TO 10M SUBS
Will this cause a Rap battle
4:18 Mario Rabbids was fine with it, you'll be fine!
Is this true
One of those guards just attempted murder
mario better call saul
wow the door knock got me
9:55 "this isn't the last you've seen of me"  Well I know what's gonna happen in the war of the fat italians 2022
This reminds me when SML got sued by Nintendo and had to stop using Nintendo Plushies
Cool
not like they can harm a maniacal AI such as me.
SMG4, if you get into legal trouble, i'll send a box full of neurotoxin straight to whatever company or person you're in legal trouble with... and when they open it.... well... you know what happens... THEY DIE...
But he will never stop making videos
Congratulations for the 6 million subscribers and this episode sums up what we are going through right now with these DMCA assholes
YESSSS ANOTHER VIDEOOOOOO
Yall had the power to use saul goodman but yall refused
The digimon world music I heard that also good episode
This is like meta runner s1 ending lol 8:54
this question has been around for a long time, is bob a character you invented, or a character from a game? if it's a game, what game is it?
It was a betrayer
I wish SMG4 stop making cring
Wow 6million dude! Congrats man 🎉
8:42 YOU WHAT
mario x meggy
He got SMLed
bro u got 6m subs u should be happy
0:41 i hear smg4
Congrats SMG4 on 6 Million Subscribers! ^^
i'am losing my"confidence" because I am playing in "poco x3 " phone gyro good but I have no wifi . 😩 I had skills like DAD GAMER but no one support me
Anyone question how Peach doesn't care what happens in her castle anymore
Congrats On 6M But Try Not To Get Sued Because Nintendo Hates All Jokes
Lawyer Kong said this isn't the last we've seen of him, I have a feeling a new arc is on its way
The monkey: we own Splatoon too
Wotfi2022?
This video could have lead to a arc.
Congratulations!
9:08 bro like they will give you money for doing that, its a job, ive never seen anyone get sad for getting money
The day of reckoning has came! SMG4 HAS BEEN ✨SUED✨
if luigi in nintendo so how abou weegepie
Toilet Paper 🤣
I was thinking about something like this the other day—
I was waiting for this video
Did you actually get sued?
Awesome vid love you explore a possible legal problems theses video's would run to and turned into an episode
I think you should do Mario if he was in Super Pets
7:12 they are breaking the law by not allowing the law to be accomplished
Nintendo: we have come to sue your face SMG4: GET, THE SHIP, OUT, OF MY ROOM  Also, congrats on the 6 mil subs, SMG4
Hey smg4 can you make a video a part 2 of that and name it Lawyer Monkey Revenge
Nintendo ninjas pingas has left existence
Shit I read the title and worried that Nintendo actually sued you
6:20 literrally nintendo owns the copyright of the inkling character the music she uses and the design of the clothes she uses
My man using the Digimon World 2 OST like a true chad.
smg4Coolsmg4Coolsmg4Cool
I’d play Super Luigi Gardening tbh
Congrats on 6mil smg4
Lawsuit arc? Lesgo
I can see Mario and Meggy becoming good friends…
Can you do a what if 2 and if so what if axol never died
So you got sued
Cool video smg4
6:28 a reference to mario University
Did anybody else like the Portland Mario was a pervert
Luigi will never be seen in another SMG4 video again.....
can we all agree that squib bomb are squib bomb without the squib
did they actually get a cease and desist letter ?
Le pouvoir de masdak
An actual problem, hope smg4 is safe from this
Congratulations on 6 million subscribers :D
You know. Meggy does have a Splatoon Shirt. So she can get cease and desist
Honestly, I feel like this will become an Ark, Lawyer kong did say "This is not the last time you'll see me" or something along the lines of that.
Holy crap Mario with no moustache is cursed
Congrations for 6 million subs
👎👎👎👎😤😤😤☠️☠️Meri
He is never gonna be in the vid
Thats True?...
Poor Luigi :(
6 million subscribers great job smg4! And great video!
OH GOD A NEW ARC THE NINTENDO SUEING ARC?????? GASP
Imagine this is YouTube kids
Nice animation for meggy dude!
Ain't that sad
were did you get the music 6:42
H.           A.               H.               A.            H.            A.                H.              A
I was getting some real Metarunner season 1 finaly vibes up until the Luigi part
In my opinion, this has gotta be one of the best episodes in terms of animation. It has just the right amount of seriousness and randomness
Congrats on 6 Million, SMG4. Hoping U be safe from horrendous BS by YouTube Overlords.
when i heard the knocking on the door i thought someone was actually here
Congrats SMG4 for SIX MILLON SUBSCRIBERS 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Super Mario Logan I mean SML got sued and its also a channel we use to enjoy, just like yours.
Nooooooooooo!
Heyyy a Mario game with friendly guns isn’t a bad idea 4:00
Me: *reads the title* NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Damn. A luigi gardening simulator sounds actually interesting! Maybe nintendo should hire SMG4?
When the next lore video?
yay
yo new vid
Rlly thought it would have a bad ending so it could kick off Wotfi
Hey meggys animation getting better
6 millons congruration men 👍👍👍🇦🇷
*The good ending*
Congratulations on your 6 mill subs!!
Only if us nintendo fans fight back like that
What would you do if you was sued by Nintendo
Smg4 is one of the best YouTube channels out there keep up the great work 👍 👏
Nice video smg4 it’s Kinda funny :)
CONGRATS ON 6M SMG4
Epik skills mario
If I remember a parody laws are thing and under them if something is a parody it's legal. If I'm correct, Maggie could have used not to save Mario.
Nintendo arc?
I hope Nintendo will start with a *Super Luigi Gardening* game now, haha 🤣
Mario: YAHOO WITH GUNS
OH MY GOD AUIGI GARDENING SIMULATOR!
based on a true story
Congrats to 6 Mio!
Makes sense, mario can solve everything in one importance event
the sml uprising
The new Better call Saul episode preview looking fire
2:01  Fitting voice for him tbh
partially
NOBODIES CARES ABOUT LUIGI IN SMG4'S WORLD
Sad days
Congratulations on 6 million subscribers
ngl the way they just seperated hands there was kinda cute 9:02
10 years later they still didn’t get copyrighted or sued good for you😊
Bro the new mario game looks sick
OK, now which continuity are we following here? First we have clowns pulling the T- pose virus thing that's seemingly affecting the entire kingdom. Then we have everyone abandoning Mario because he ruined a pizza, leading to him going insane and ruining a bigger pizza. And now Nintendo is seizing Mario for some unknown copyright reasons, and Meggy is helping him escape. Which story are we following exactly? The last episode ended with a "to be continued"-. Are we following that story, or a completely new one? I'm confused!
I think my brain just codmmited suasiad
This could actually be the series finale
Congrats on 6M SMG4!! ❤️🎉🥳
Hopefully this doesn't happen as it happened to SML
R I P   Super Mario  1983-2022
Wait isn't thare a castle law that means smg4 or mario and the gang can technically shoot at the lawyer and his goons also wouldn't buring the contracts make them not count now also smg4 lore logic mario is the main character so that means main character logic can be applied also bowser and peach and others are also required to have the ownership act and the one who created them is dead so technically by that logic nintendo can,t do any thing yay I did my research
Congrats on 6M smg4, I’ve been subbed since 5M, you’ve gone far
n i c e 6 milly
New arc!?
4:04 Seriously mate, go join Activision if you want to get access to the use of guns there mate.
Your asome
Lol first SML and Now SMG4
Lawyer Kong is gonna be the big boss in this year's WOTFI. I can feel it.
I already congratulated you brother in your last video as well in twitter i say again here bro… CONGRATS YOU PAST THE TEST MY BOY!
2:26 reskinned swag chis
YEAH PIKMIN
I’m sorry for what I said before.Gud job
Oh no!!! what has nintendo done to him XD
ayo what happened to the production quality it like tripled or smt
Bruh moment
Sml flashbacks 0:04
Poor luigi
I guess this explains why Mario’s buttons were silver for a good bit of this episode.
suggestion if mario was in horizon zero dawn/ forbidden west
Virgin lawyer kong vs chad Saul Goodman
How is #3 on GAMING?????
Smg4 have you seen Door stuck
SMG4 almost went the way of SML
What are you gonna do for 6m subs smg4?
Brooooo🤣 smg4 hasn’t made me laugh like this in a while🤣🤣 this feels like a classic episode from like 2015 or smth
Is this true btw
Not the pikmin
I think this video was right at the end because Nintendo accepts "Fanmade games."
Oh thank god Mario's Safe i thought he was going to be taken
If lawyer kong becomes an arc, I'm shitting myself. on the toilet. without pants.
Why do I have a feeling funky Kong is gonna be a reoccurring villain
Mario hits SMG4 or ruining his stuff he probably gets sued
Never mind the clown ark this has to ATLEAST be part of the ark please press 1 if you agree
bozo
Mario and Meggy fighting ninjas to Digimon World 2 music?  Pinch me, I'm dreaming.
7:11 Nice face for memes xD
The best red duo of ever
LORE BEGINS SOON I THINK
Miyamoto has the same VA as Brook from one piece  Ok seriously every Japanese character so far has been voiced by a one piece character. Pretty neat
CONGRATS ON 6MIL
I wonder what meggy would’ve looked like in a genie harem dance outfit?
Hey Smg4 how does it feel to have 6 Million Subscribers?
did he after get sued? or is this just a joke
What was with the sudden change in both quality and design?! It really threw me off! It's not bad. It just suprised me. That's all.
Muggy should also be a target scince she is a squid kid (aka splatoon)
Parody laws: *laughs*
I am going to cry 😢😭
oh no SUED?!
🤣🤣
Remember if it gets copyright claimed by Nintendo its cannon
4:45 spider-meggi
Door
Jim Carrey's "The Mask" is a 1994 film seen from the perspective of a Bank Teller who discovers a strange artifact(A.K.A) the mask, which turns him into a hero hoping to fulfill his desires
Congrats on 6 million 🎉
First Sml now you
Wait isint meggy nintendo property sonce she once was a inkling
2:30 he didn't even use the safety strap. What a gamer
5488 coment
A lot of TTYD references XD
We have just started the new ERA. The Nintendo ERA, along with war of the fat Italians 2023. I’m gonna be excited for that.
Prayers you never receive copyright infringement from Nintendo based on intellectual property. I speak for the fans and we need your amazing and awesome content!
6:27 Meggy unlocked a new power
i swear if u actually wont make any more vids
He could’ve just said “Yes”
Good Job smg4 for reaching 6mil subscribers
OH OK THIS MUST BE AN ARC NOW COME ON
Animation quality on here has gotten a major boost (besides no moustache mario) making the videos even better. Nice job. I doubt this will be the last time the crew encounters the devilish magic of lawyers
Anyone wondering where glitch shorts went? Or is it just me
what about when splatoon 3 comes out...?
Can we understand that this is the first video that 2 characters talk in the same frame? And I've been watching since 2016 so.. that's new
I love that he brought up leggy went to law school. Feels like so long ago
I’ll take your entire stock!
This is funny because if this channel was based on sonic SEGA would’ve done the *complete opposite*
When do we get the video for mario roast
This was a 10/10 for me
Somehow meggy always has best animation
when wofti 2023 happens lawyer kong should return and make smg4 fight him in the wofti challenges to not get sued
Mom?
Nice
It's safe to say that if Nintendo did do this, all 6 million+ of us would protest
Guns x Nintendo
what happen if Nintendo see your videos and tell you to stop using Mario and cie ?
When i see those ninjas i can’t stop thinking about the butt ninja from guards n retards…..oh the memories….
We all saw this coming
2017 5nd mario
This is good
Did you actually get sued
Damn that was a weird video
5:18 HOLY SHIT THAT KNOCKED SCARED ME
Dont know how i read mario gets sued. And why is it trending in gaming
What happened to murder drones
#2 on gaming nice
Man, they should of just called Saulz then they would of been perfectly fine
O
The fact I get to see Meggy with an actual voice instead of the normal gurgle noises from splatoon is something I like
Do you notice an interesting fact, that with every million subscribers Mario thinks less and less about spaghetti porn and takes up his mind? We continue in the same spirit SMG4.
The voice acting pisses me off
Ayyyyy happy 6million
I've been watching this guy for almost 8 years. He has grown a lot. I remember when he still used the plain-old text on the screen with little to no sound effects. God I feel so old...
What if this was true?                                          It is not lol
First sml NOW SMG4
Nintendo just being jealous the mario movie won't be as good as your vids
Congrats
based on true events
Honestly even without the Nintendo characters, SMG4 can still go on his original characters like Meggy.
MAKE MORE ANIME FIGHTS!!!
I feel like the next video is gonna be: Mario and The Box.
Rip
Ay no
10/10
#2 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING
10:42
6 hours ago but smg4 made a comment 9 days ago?
guys! he time has came! Nintendo finally demanded SMG4 for the Mario's rights! (I'm not happy at that, I say finally because, ufff! Nintendo really took SO much time to demand SMG4 for the Mario's rights)
Nintendo better not sue you, these videos are too good to be taken down.
I miss you smg4 i forgot about you
Bro did you really get sued!?
New arc?
"for a cease and desist order," - meggy 2022 (especially like in Philippines From abs cbn corporation!)
What no how and when does even happened man ?
Bruh
If that was a game mario with guns 🤔
Noooo
Meggy looks so animated
Wow you have 6milion folower btw im from Indonesia im love you content that fun but you upgrade the meme
Congrats on 6 mill big fella can’t wait to indulge in more SMGLore
Save smg4
Congratulations for being number 6 on trending
I love you
Congratulations on 6 million subs!
Is this of beginning of a new arc?
I like the Ace Attorney collab sort of. Please do more of that!
$1,000,000,000,000 AU
cant wait until wotfi 2022
That's episode almost made me though SMG4 was over forever. I'm glad Mario is still with us and smg4 continues his amazing videos especially wotfis and new plots.
Finally 6 million congrats!
6:44 is that Digimon World 2 battle ost!! nice choice smg4 :D
Smg4 can read minds apparently, i thought of the same context at the same day
Oh no, I NEED your videos!
Lol am late but play fall guys mario
Rad ❤️💖✨✨
idea: mario meets toad's gf and likes her so he tries to get them to break up
The callback to Mario University was amazing. I'd love to see a full trail
Rip Luigi 2014 to 2022
I swear if this is the beginning of an arc I'm going to lose it
i really want to see if mario was in pikmin lol
NOOOOOOO, ITS REALLY A SMG4 FANS WORST NIGHTMARE, MARIO BEING SENT TO NITENDO BECAUSE OF… who knows why
Noooo
I swear this arc is gonna be called the Lawsuit arc          Edit: I Called It
Lawer Kong being funky XD also good way to talk about the hell that goes on with legal issues and the fact it's better to play safe than sorry
Nintendo game idea's in a nutshell.
Meggys friend would be proud of her now for sure
sheesh
Come someone please tell me what that music is from that the picmin are dancing to at the 0:24 mark? It’s driving me crazy. I know I’ve heard it somewhere before.
They made a video about SML
You know they couldve just made a fangame to lure nintendo to them and then beat the absolute PINGAS out of them  Actually screw that they couldve just shot the lawyer
When ur early but still late: 0:20
This is a true story by SMG4
Meggy's a lawyer, how'd she get the idea to mess with Nintendo?
Lets see Meggy and smg4 has all the text voice acted and not reused lines Finer animations than normal A character seeking revenge now Yep, a new ark is coming boys
Those ninjas should have been the elite beat agents
Lawsuits are scary
10:10 lmao the lack of joy when the luigi tts said the is just so funny to me
@SMG4 has this ever happened before?
It feels weirder hearing the Lizzie Freeman voice clips mixed with Elsie Lovelock talking. Couldn't they just have her record the little stunt snippets instead of using the Lizzie Freeman voice clips?
nintendo games are weird.
COOLLlL
WHA…
I can sense the lawyer kong arc coming soon
He ended up just like SML I’m so sorry SMG4.
R u actually gonna be leaving
Wow! Uhm welp now luigi is back on the nintendo and now is the star
First sml then smg4???
hey atleast meggy cant be taken not after the incident
Me and SMG4 have the same mind. No one’s really gonna miss Luigi so Eh
Congratulations on getting 6 million subscribers, SMG4!
Size and gravity don't go well
New ark?
Actually I want to see Lawyer Kong again someday.  Maybe he and Meggy would have a Phoenix Wright-style legal battle in a courtroom.
Wait no you’re no longer making SMG4 videos please make more and continue mario in the back rooms part 2 p.s stay for us please we beg you SMG4 master of memes
the animation has progressed a lot.
6 mil
You know a mario based gardening game sounds pretty relaxing like it's a crossover with animal crossing
That ending before Miyamoto burst through the door looked similar to the Meta Runner Season 1 ending
Dude the sound at 00:44 sounded way too real
Was thinking for a second there gonna be mario getting reclaimed by Nintendo arc
Now I low-key want a Luigi gardening game
Top 3. Most Bad Ass Characters in SMG4  3.Chris 2.Saiko 1.Meggy
You Can Say That Nintendo Might Sued'es . [ SMG4 ] For Copy Right Issue's . OR Might Be [ MEGGY SPLETZER ] Could Get Sued'es For Saving [ MARIO MARIO ] Ars ..com
Video title “SMG4 gets sued”, what didn’t happen “SMG4 gets sued” I’m not criticising the video I’m just saying that it’s a false title
love the content
It's the restraining order for me
Ya
Stupiiiiiiiiiid Megggyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡ 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡3:23
It's great seeing a meggy and Mario focused episode again. Elsie is doing alright with the voice work too.
Mario and SMG4 when Luigi is gone:EH
Season finale be like
hey wait wheres the super meggy bat?
2:23 The return of the... *BUTT NINJA*
Nintendo does it to everybody who has 1 millisecond of Mario on on of there vidios
0:46 JEEZUS CHRIST MAN-
Hmmm Luigi's garden that would be a good game
Imagine Nintendo actually sues you 😂
2017 5nd
Can you please make a video where Mario goes to space
Congrats 6m subs
Run smg4, ruuuuuuuuuun
I love how they made fun of the fact that meggy is no longer copyrighted lol.  And like everyone else is saying,  the animation is really good here. It's kind of strange seeing non gmod animation outside of songs or revelations.
Meggy saying hold it was so wholesome
Hey I found this not surprising cause another YouTuber also had this problem it's sml
I live in constant fear of the day this actually happens and smg4 gets the sml treatment
Congratulations on geting to 6M subs
Honestly I don’t think SMG4 will ever get sued, only cause this kinda branched to his own thing since it’s not really just with Nintendo characters, it’s with his own characters and arcs and what not
This probably part of the   clown arc
Nooooo SMG4 whyyyyy?!
You should do a Maggie reaction video where Maggie reacts to the videos of SMG four in the part where she was away
6M 6M 6M 6M
I Hope You're Ok, I Really Enjoyed Your 5 Years Of Content..
literally relatable bruh they sued roblox just cuz of a roblox accessory that LOOKS LIKE YOSHIS EGG LIKE BRO ITS JUST AN EGG THEY CAN ALWAYS REMAKE IT
5
Neat 6k!
let me guess a new arc? the nintendo arc??
Huh, the butt ninja is back with his army of clones.
Is it just me or is there a growing amount of guys who hate Mario and smg4. First depresso now lawyer Kong, evil enemy group? Also has one of them been going to law school to make this idea.
I'd honestly play a Luigi gardening game, Daisy could be in it!
This is super surreal because this could actually happen
What
no he cant stop:( noooo!:(
Sometimes I forget mario is a Nintendo game and not originally part of smg4s gimmicks
MEGGY IS SO WELL ANIMATED
Wait meggy has a original model
Plus the oof is gone
Should of called saul
*heh?*
Nintendo's lawyer being a literal monkey is way to accurate.
9:55 I wonder if we are actually gonna see this character again. What the heck will this guy do wean he returns again? Idk, but am excited to see what this character will do in the future. As long as he doesn’t become a forgotten character
Wait smg4 is getting sued why what nooooooooooooo not smg4
MEGGY WENT TO LAW SCHOOL!!??
E
I know u yes the guy I meet at party is reading this
If this is real,then I'm sorry it happened.
Bro im scared are u guys sued?????????
they haave the power of editing they can just make him pull out a mini gun
I don't know why, but when I saw the thumbnail of this video, I thought an arc or something would happen. (Also congrats on SMG4 for 6M subscribers.)
I swear… Meggy saves Mario’s pingas every time he gets into trouble 😂😂 she’s a great friend for that!!
darn
😂😂😂🤣🤣 this video is funny
7:34 a whole new definition when you say, you've had too much shrooms🤣🤣💀
Well at least you guys didnt get sued but you know who got sued sml not they resort to making ugly ass human puppets instead of keeping the classic mario puppets
The horror to anyone who creates content from or based on a franchise.
I would definitely play super Luigi gardening.
But it’s true way back when we liked mario odyssey we wanted a part 2
good video although I keep wondering what happened to the theme of the clowns. how is it solved?
I really liked Meggy's animation movement. Don't know how to describe it, but it looked great!
Yo congrats on 6 million subscribers why not make a special about it next video
Doesn,t Nintendo own meggy to cus meggy is a slpatoon character and splatoon is from Nintendo
Hi
Congrats on 6M
YOU REACHED 6M SMG4
pov: roblox
I hope smg4 didn't actually get sued
That why Nintendo is bad
I kinda want a video where smg4 learns about the zero point field manipulater (hl2 gravity gun)
The whole time I was expecting a better call saul joke but it never came :(
Wouldn’t meggy, boopkins, Luigi, and more be controlled by Nintendo?
Did you actually get sued
Better Call Meggy! 🐙💼
6M? Man, this has been a long ride, and we’re just getting started! Good luck on the journey, boys!!
Eh, could be worse at least its not games workshop 0_0
really thought it would be the start of a new arc
XDD
At least Luigi got it easy this time
Miyamoto being mad about Mario using a gun is funny considering how Miyamoto was originally going to have Mario use a gun in Super Mario Bros. lol.
Congratulations SMG four you made it this far to 6 million and it’s been 11 years keep up keep it up we’re all happy for you
:0 6MILL?!
Nintendo shall NOT own mario  -SMG4
DMCA stands for dumb mothersuckercovid 19 a## (probaly)
Congratulations on 6 million subscribers Smc4 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 I hope you got some good memes coming this year!
My favorite part of the video is when Mario mard all over those bad guys
Lets wait for the comment from Nintendo
Happy 6M subscribers SMG4! I been watching your videos 7 years! and again……HAPPY 6M SUBSCRIBERS!!!!
Congrats on reaching 6m subs man hope ya  stay safe   Rlly a life without smg4 is just boring
Let's hope this never happens.
After the take that and hold it, I was hoping it would become a full fledged ace attorney court case
*The Butt Ninja has returned.*
That is so crap no idea why Nintendo sues SMG4 for using Nintendo characters its like if SEGA sued someone for using Sonic characters
Finally a smg4 that isn’t a stupid react video or some normal looking video that isn’t funny and adventurous, old school smg4 like the way I like it
I got a video idea, Smc4 and Smc3 stuck in a room together for 34 hours. I think they look cute together. 😁😏
Knowing Nintendo it’s a surprise he haven’t actually been sued yet
I have to buy that game when it comes out xD
So when’s your 6 million special gonna come out?
I love your vids but I have a friend that's German so could you make German undertitles
smg4 graduations for reaching 6 million  claps for you man
at First i literally thought it would end like we are never about to see Mario in SMG4's Channel again, something like Axol as an exsample. Geez i'm glad it was just a "Joke" haha  Edit: May People ask themselves why I think like that, Nintendo never really was a fan of fan games or something like that. I think if i remember correctly they deleted some Videos just for using their music (ost). So as i said i'm so happy to see my favourite plumber beeing a lazy ass and sitting on his ass eating Pasta again :))))
Oh no he got sued rip
Did that actualy happening
I feel like this is going to be an arc ending with WOTFI 2022
Is this going to have a new arc?   The Nintendo arc
POV: you made a fan-game
You always make me happy even though I am depressed I Love you VIDEO😆
Y'know the world the fact smg4 made his meme filled world out of a 64 game, apperently his meme guardians couldn't hold off a imitation of a Nintendo brand such as lawyer Kong. Just saying, the rules of the smg4 world might feel broken to me, even if it's meant to be hilariously stupid.
For a second there i thought nintendo gave smg4 a cease and decist and that he would have to stop making videos or actually get rid of mario for good
10:05 I can't stop replying this
Mario: N O O N E T O U C H E S M A R I O ‘ S M U S T A C H E ! ! ! Also congrats on 6m Luke!
YEA 6 MIL LETS GOOOO!!!! Mario should get his pingus stuck in the door for the 420th time now!
Awesome
somebody who's better versed in international IP acts and all of that,would Nintendo actually have a case here? I know that copyright and IPS are different depending on the country but would Nintendo be able to sue glitch Productions who lives in Australia for using their character from their Japanese company
SMG4 has survived the YouTube algorithim for 11 years. He should be fine.
This should be the wotfi build up
WE WHERE SO CLOSE TO A NEW ARC
Congratulations on 6 Million Subscribers SMG4! I've been here since June of 2014 (More specifically, Super Mario 64 Bloopers: Boil the Big Bully). Yep, I'm one of your old fans sticking around. I still love your random Mario humor to this day, even if some of your episodes hadn't turn out to be good. Overall, I'll still be here for you SMG4. Keep up the great work!
Well, you're already in dreadful impact so can't say I'm sorry.
Mario and Meggy Working fight together again good SMG4 happy 6 million Subscribes
IS THIS TRUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE SMG4
i hate stupid mario
New arc?
i like how smg4 animated meggy very smooth
after watching him for over than 3 years, he finally reached 6m, I feel proud of him
We have a brand new villain
8:50 SMG4 said and mario said too meggy reference Meta Runner
I mean, if worse comes to worse, just give everyone the meggy treatment
how come meggey didnt get kidnaped for spatoon 3
The knocks really got me good
wait. will you really get sued one day??????
This is new ark material
imagine if this was real and at the end when mario walks away the camera fades black with the text "goodbye mario"
I never realized smg4 used brooks jp voice for Miyamoto until i herd yohohohoho
I sense a Nintendo arc
CONGRATULATIONS 🥳
Congrats on 6m!
When you sorta forget that, "Oh yeah, Meggy is a lawyer."
what if this was true
Don't they own meggy to?
This channel is always great for a dumb laugh. And despite being a meme channel, you know how to make interesting and amusing stories.
7:27 you forgot the "helicopter helicopter" meme
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
A new ark is coming i feel it
Imagine Nintendo comes back and sega trys to save mario with using sonic that would be a epic fight
I hope this isn't a serious video. Being sued or DMCA'd sucks.
Who else would want a Super Luigi Gardening game?
Where is smg4 gets som maidens
I love meggy Mario episodes
🤩👏👏👏 6m
Great to see a Meggy-focused episode! She and Mario really kicked butt in this one.
Omg 6 million subs
SMG4 I think you should make the Mario arc
Meggy has gone far being introduced in 2017 (I think) to this you really grown with animations👍
I like the fact that sml got sued for using their Nintendo plushies but these guys haven’t been told shit
Congratulations on 6 mil. It's been an honor getting to be here for all the million sub milestones
Mario as soon as they say among us: *ANGRY NOISES* IM GONNA KILL ALL OF YOU
In Legal Trouble? Better Call Kong!
Murder drones season 1 when?
This is why SMG4 was creating new characters.
Ah no you need the  Phoenix Wright and Edgeworth team up in hete. Who Smg4 needs is Saul Goldman, who will fight for anyone and will be on his side. 7:16 that is an absolute generic shooting game/tf2 moment
Meggy 's voice actor voices yanfei😱
congrats 6 Million, SMG4 adventure and animation
Super Luigi Gardening 2 when?? But seriously the animation is excellent this episode. Great work
Yes I remember something a Mario in netando and it's a new Mario game coming in 2024 or 2023
Sml be like
I feel like this could become an arc
MEGGY READ THE NINTENDO TERMS OF SERVICE WHY
Me at the end of the video "wait so Mario technically just gotta go to work n make a game haha
For a second I though it would be the last smg4 video. But nope.😁
Can I buy super luigi gardening I like it
I am very curious about, if Nintendo did go to SMG4 with a cease and desist, what would happen with Meggy? Her model and name are original, but she wears inkling clothing, uses splatoon weapons, and even was an inkling. What would happen?
This will definitely what will happen if smg4 gets sued
congrats for smg4 reaching 6 million subs  hopefully nintendo leaves him alone ;)
Congrats on 6 Million man. It feels like you just hit 5 million not too long ago
That fucking door Knock, scared the living shit outta me
I was actually scared at first when I saw the thumbnail
i feel like we've missed adding saul goodman into this episode
Happy 6 Mil
AYO THERE IS PIKMIN WHERE MARIO IS?!?!?! Edit: the timestamp is at 0:24
HAPPY 6 MIL!!!
SMG4: why do I hear boss music?
8:08 And nothing of value was lost.  (reference to who let the chomp out)
Para continuar más video teminar camión del año nuevo 2023 😉👍🤙♥️♥️ saludos 🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
Your honor, my client can not be racist. He loves all races, even the bad ones
Damn they really did Luigi like that
Hi
9:39
Mario is a chad
Oh wow you used digimon world 2 battle music!!! That's so awesome
I THOUGHT U WAS SERIOUS
Does SMG4 dislike luigi?? I can't tell at this point, but good video!
I hate Meggy
Who animating these animations because there killing it
Me: LETS FUCKING GO 6 MILLION  also can I well nevermind
You can s
5:27 the animation look cool
meggy is so well animated in this video
Tbh it's kinda unfair how Nintendo sued SML who's been DOING THE EXCACT SAME THING AS SMG4 (but with plushies) BUT SML STILL GOT SUED AND HE HAD TO MOVE CHANNELS/CHANGE CHARACTERS AND EVERYTHING JUST TO STAY ON YOUTUBE. As you can see I'm still pissed off by that
Congrats On 6m Subs
"SMG4 Gets Sued" SML: First Time?
Am I weird for recognizing Digimon World 2 music?
A gardening game would be interesting
Ayo dmca claims? I THINK NOT
First SML and now SMG4 himself! :d
Bro congrats on 6MIL I was wishing it happened
This feels like WOTFI material
Best video
10:09 me: OMG, SUPER LUIGI GARDENING? BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!        me after i play the game: bro worst game ever... probaly garden games is not good
I love the Miyamoto "Yohohohhoho."
i like this episode idea
Congrats for The 6 millions Of suscribers!!
POV: you thought he was actually sued
The finger cracking when Meggy was breaking free from the cease and desist was the coolest and creepiest shit I've seen her do in a while. And the battle sequence was super badass!!! ...and the ending with Family from Super Mario Galaxy playing... my heart melted 😭
I have one question are you actually getting sued
Name it Mario kart (mostly)
Sounds like smg4 Better call Saul
I can see Nintendo making a Luigi's Gardening game. XD
Can u make a vídeo of Mario kart but i en out bad
I forgot how horrible meggys voice actor is.
Hopefully you don't get sml'd
OMG, SMG4 WHY ARE YOU SUED, I'M SORRY!
I wouldn't mind a game about Luigi gardening.
Congratulations on 6 mil subs!
They dont care about Luigi
Yay Mario is back😃😃
Praise to admidha buhgy
rip Luigi
6 million subs later, and meggy continues to be the best character.
CONGRATULATIONS ON 6M Subscribers SMG4
It is that ammount of sub count
Mario no longer here;(
So is Luigi still in the game or is he gone
Who can make the best naked spaghetti party for Mario during WOTFI?
Lawyer Kong better be a fucking returning villain.
Welp it happened to sml it was only a matter of time
9:03  Kang the conqueror reference. Heh..oh wait..DOES THAT MEAN HE’S GONNA GET SUED BY DISNEY!?
Lol Mario ded
2:10  that one pose makes me say "what"
7:25 oh wow that bgm. the nostalgia
BRO this video was awesome!
YES!!!!!!! YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY GAINED 6 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS LETS GO :DDD
Lawyer Kong: This isn’t the last you’ve seen of me.  Me: Is this the Wotfi 2022 arc?
🥳 congrats on hitting 6 million subs smg4 🥳 hope you get 7 million subs very soon
SuperMarioLogan Moment
Can nintendo really sue this channel. And i dont think it really cares cause this is good for them (likes ads), so i dont think that they wnat to do that (and under what grounds)
Isn't Splatoon a Nintengo game with guns?
Good to see lawyer Meggy back
Rip smg4 copyrights
Reminder that even Kirby has used guns
Nintendo arc? Idk I’m just guessing at this rate.
The funny thing is that meggy used to belong to nintendo lol
Damn, Mario is so powerful that he can’t die from his neck being snapped 3:03
How to kill nitento in the world of smg4( thanos gauntlet exixts just use it to nitento ( i have a litle english))
tbh I expected saul goodman to be Mario's lawyer because he is a meme too :(
Its nice to see law school came in handy
Just asking if this did happen I be so sad I be cry I love your videos smg4 is so funny pls don’t leave us smg4
Surprise Butt Ninja??  Plus, the irony of Miyamoto not allowing guns in a Mario game when he ORIGINALLY wanted them from the start...
for tax fraud!? 😆 🤣 😂
Congrats on 6 mil
nintendo: NO GUNS!!! THIS IS A NINTENDO GAME!!! also nintendo: splatoon
Dear smg4, i hope you will be fine. Here's an petition sign to continue ↓ 📝               -rodion
0:15 when you read IT and get to "that part"
Good stufd
Day 1 of asking for if mario was in danganronpa
You cut off Mario's moustache, your head gets cut off. Life lesson.
De look like de fbi open up
just want to say that smg4 can’t be sued as he is using nintendo as parodic purposes wich is completely legal ( don’t worry timmy )
Bro if this is real are we getting a new luigis mansion the gardening house edition?
did you realize there isnt a sponsor either a intro?
Bro got sued
0:30 finn scream
Holy God,SMG4 videos gets worse and worse,i hope nintendo actually sues you
I have a feeling smg4 will be sued like SML
Why do I feel like this is some Nintendo arc
SMG4: **runs and hides in box** Mario: *Mom?*
New arc 🤨
Omg xD
I Just Realized U Got 6M Subscribers Congrats
nintendo will not like this....
Better call Saul.And congrats
You got what now
I didn't know know that Meggy went to law school, partially. Better Call Meggy.
Looks like we better call Saul
It's my birthday 🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉 🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝
Therefore, the cease and desist will cease to exist
the final is one classic
Congrats on 6 million subs!
Callin it right now. This is gonna be the next big arc
It’s axle gonna be back
Did you really get sued smg4
It’s ma birthday 🥳
6 million party
Yo Super Luigi Gardening sounds sick where do I buy 🤑
I legit heard Super Luigi Godning
Bro i thought a knew arc bout to start 💀💀
Congrats on 6 mile Man Keep up the great work
WHO just one day watched a smg4 video and now can’t stop?
💖👍👍
Congrats on 6m Smg4 your the best☺️☺️😋
Lawyer Kong arc I bet Edit: I FUCKING CALLED IT!
Wow I can't believe Mario and meggy make Nintendo sad
Would any of you actually be surprised if Nintendo did go after SMG4?
in the 300000
It was bound to happen..
What!!?? Why because smg4’s  to funny!? So many fucking haters out here. LMMFAO
Your getting better at animating
IS MIYAMOTO BROOK???
This is just a warning for what Nintendo will do if he ever gets on their radar.
Luigi actullymbenefits fun from working on the game hes just having fun gardening :)
I am happy that Smg4 didn't get sued like what happened to sml
I can't wait to play the new luigi game ITS SO HD FOR A SWITCH GAME
mario for 3 second become pro 2:28
You missed a opportunity for Saul Goodman to be in here with all the lawyer stuff
dudee the anamations you are making now are soo good love your vids you help me alot with hard times ad you still make me laugh as much as your old vids keep it up
Smg4 is really pushing his chances with this video
love SMG4 videos so entertaining and weird
I honestly was expecting an ARC about this...like Mario does go and at the end he returns and life continues to be normal
Very angry Mario and donkey
Yesir congrats on hitting 6m subs
Who recognised this as a meta runner reference?
Nintendo characters is free npc's
Question u use garry mod or gmod
i knew this would happen one day
Cool
If you really had to stop I would die
There is a law that protects parodies so I’m pretty sure smg4 would be safe.
Wotfi 2022?
Why do the animations in this look good In this?
Damn
Mario stays with SMG4, Luigi gets his own game I see this as an absolute win!
PLEASE STAY ALIVE
Were you literally going to get sued by Nintendo?
I''m not really surprised, but it's only been 6 months since your subscriber count became 5 million, I honestly didn't think this would happen so fast, so congratulations.
Mario in jail
Mario in jail
Mario in jail
The Splatoon thing doesn’t make sense in the video
Congratulations on evading Nintendo copyright
Congrats for 6 million subs!!
Bruuh 9:53 reminds me of what Kernal Sanders said after Mario escaped f on the washing machine Revenge 🤔
Wait HOW THEESE POST LIKe 3DAYS LONG it makes no sense
Who is that rock in your picture
O my  *New arc time boys*
Is this a new arc lol
AYO 6m subs!
imagine if smg4 was actually getting sued, and kinda like super mario logan he would use his own characters instead
I would think there would be an Unironic Game Of This. I believe it's called Animal Crossing. Just slap a Luigi Costume there and boom. Super Luigi Gardening. And it seems Luigi doesn't mind as much as Mario with having to deal with Nintendo.
Dude. Nintendo hire these people. They just thought up a potencially amazing game for you. Litteraly the game's story could just be Luigi's trying to make the mansion from Luigi's Mansion his proper home. Imagine. It's just Harvest Moon but Luigi
Pov:ur a meme
smg4 hates but also likes Luigi
We need Meggy to say TAKE THAT! before a mod can be made bro Have you never played Ace Attorney?
That was beautiful
Mario will always be free person and yes of course he can do anything or be anything. Just like all of us... The people. (Freedom of Choice)👍  "Bravo"👏👏🏻👏🏽👏🏿👏🏼👏🏾
1:47 7:51
Congrats on 6 million ❤❤
Meggy is immune to the cease-and-desist because she’s no longer a inkling, which are Nintendo characters.
Very good editing man,it's not sus it's a yahoo level!aka amazing level
Did this actually happened?
That scared me for a second
How the f can meggy just fly
I love the meta runner
“Mom.”  -Mario
What did you do man?
It’s always nice to see positive vibes with Mario and Meggy!!
when did they turn smg4 into an action movie lol
yos
It was only a matter of time
7.05 Where Mario goes insane because his moustache goes mammamia away
I bet this going to be a new story arc
Wake up honey SMG4 uploaded
SMG4 does what Nintendon't   ok, jokes aside, I liked this episode, and congratulations for 6 Millions subs my dude!
I started crying
2:34
I do Hope, Smg4 doesnt end up like SML
Bottom text
Woah the animations got better now but i would like a arc to save luigi from nintendo it would be cool
Insane episode. Today is my brother's birthday and he likes your videos
YES- I MEAN NOOOO 😥
It’s weird how they wouldn’t want meggy and Mario
Did Smg4 just get another subs in only one year? Jesus
O emoşide  ne
I love how sometimes they would animate Meggy's mouth instead of her being shaken around. This new animation style is so much better
I sense an arc
imagine smg4 10 mil play button
Mario seems to be getting smarter and a bit dumber, I hope we get a movie with Normal Mario meeting the SMG4 verse
mario got a girl friend
Meggy throws a bomb at them and the owner responds by “Whoah!”
Getting sued for hitting 6mil subs? Dayum...
I'd play super luigi gardening
Sml super mario logan knows that feeling on getting sued by nintendo
I reccomend that you call saul
You’d probably get sued by some idiot claiming you “stole their content” from them.
Could you imagine if the video ended with lawyer Kong taking Mario away, and we never got another SMG4 video?
Hopefully smg4 doesn’t get the SML treatment
10:12 - SLGn
Omg is 6M subscribe now
Tfw you see a setup for yet another unfunny arc instead of the regular videos which have been about as funny as the old ones recently.  Welp, good things can't last forever.  Not gonna lie though, this was still super funny lmao.
Good luck for getting 6 millon Journey so good luck for getting 7 millón🙂💙⭐👍
6 000 000
Nintendo: ANY CHARACTER FROM THE SUPER MARIO FRANCHISE IS OURS AND OURS ALONE! STOP USING THEM OR WE WILL SEND A TEAM OF TERRORISTS TO KILL YOU!
6 M Suscribers!? CONGRATS SMG4!
CONGRATS SMG4 U GOT 6M SUBS!
1:28 Bowser's Fury gets forgotten
what isthe music in this video
Funny
Congrats on 6 Million Subs SMG4! I hope you and your videos are making more and more people happy, just like me! 👍
Hi
Axol
Burh
6:44 why arc don't have any cool action sequences like this but instead we just have beloved characters dying
What about the War of the Fat Italians MMXXII, is it delayed or coming soon?
Yo smg4 finally got 6MILL
I thought nintendo was gonna say "JOKES ON YOU WE OWN YOU Y TOO!" on meggy when she saved mario
So, how does it feel, making your first video with 6M subs?
Super Mario world 3D on the Wii s4
godbye luigi : (
I LOVE It
A Luigi gardening game actually doesn't sound so bad
Well thank God I'm glad Nintendo it's not actually suing him because we became prompt from SML that SML got sued by Nintendo so yeah I'm actually in glad they actually kept them because they need them for  Means
nice on the 6m, i new some shat would come in and save marios ass
I don't know. I think a gardening sim featuring luigi would be pretty cool. Like Harvest Moon or something.
Eh
Hi
LETS GOOOO 6 MILLION!
6:45 Mario actually landed on his feet.
8:35 WAIT WAT?!?!?!?!?! 😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰😰
Arrestaron a Mario por pedof1lo
If Nintendo really got SMG4 cornered into surrendering Mario, he could make different parody videos of other IPs. (What happened to Sonic the Derphog?) I wonder if a Super Meme Guardian can pick a different world and avitar... And if that IP's lawyers come knocking, he can repeat the cycle.  Plus, knowing THIS Mario, he'd find a clever way to overthrow Nintendo AND its lawyers as he did with other villanous gods.
Guile theme  street fighter 2
Nintendo Lawyer arc?
0:44 IT SOUNDS SO REAL
Thd wii instructions : Never use the wii remote and joystick as numbchucks. Mario : IF YA CARE SMACK THIS SPAGETTI-ASS
it has a little something for everyone                     except you, you get nothing
HE GOT THE 6 MILLION
You know I would like a Luigi gardening game
Epic toad was in this yes(he is the blue toad)
Nice job. Keep up the good work. You are sure to hit millions more subscribers in the future.
Love another episode of mass murder and sadness
Congratulations for 6mil smg4💃🕺💃🕺
Pls do a collab with shockhat734
I'm glad your channel is actually knocking sued
I have never laughed so much keep making more of these 😂.
BTW BIG NEWS SPLATTOON 3 IS COMING OUT SOON ✨️✨️✨️🎊🎊🎊🎉🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🎊🎉🥳🥳🥳🥳
They may have let you get away with this one but don't let your guard down.
i dont know if the channel will end really
My biggest nightmare: your videos stopping
After 10 years this guy gets sued
8:30  Once upon a time, especially after the Genesis Arc, I hoped and prayed this would happen
3:36 - SMWLU69+
Been watching you guys since Dinosaurs and Wallets, so proud to see you reach 6 Mil subs. Congrats!
All the best for the 6 mio sub
I honestly thought of an concept idea for Wotfi 2022 where it follows up from this episode about if Mario did have to come back to Nintendo. And then SMG4 would have to fight Mario (brainwashed by Nintendo) in many challenges. And of course, Miyamoto becomes the host , and a rap battle happens between Smg4 and Mario relating to copyright. And the 2nd phase leads to Mario being free from Nintendo 's control, thus aiding Smg4 and company against Miyamoto. And perhaps we would already know the outcome of it. Again, my idea is just a concept. I'm impressed by how this episode actually ended.  Holy crap, my prediction is somewhat true  0:52 Lawyer Kong's 1st words
SMG4 needs at least a character, reference or some sort of cameo in the next mario game
I thought it was real? 😂
No one escapes da meggy law
Congratulations for 6 M
We love u smg4 u will always be in our hearts
Luigi is gone :( !
Awesome
Don’t get DMCA’d smg4, my life won’t be complete without your content :c
tbh i expected more something related to splatoon 3 at the end since meggy helped mario and stuff but still good to see ya ain't having any problem with nintendo :D
Funky Kong isn’t so funky
Meggy: w-what about Luigi???  *EH*
Metal Cap saves the day yet again.
Wait mario can be smart?
I've got a idea for a new arc. Arc: The Malhare Arc Enemy: Glitchtrap (Leader), Vanny (Co-Deputy Leader), Spring Bonnie (Co-Deputy Head), Glamrocks (Not including Glamrock Freddy since he's good) (Old Animatronics), Pittrap (Bodyguard), Virtual Animatronics (Main Attractions) Good Guys: Mario, Meggy, Melony, SMG4, SMG3, SMG2, SMG1, Bob, Boobkins, Glamrock Freddy, Originally Animatronics (Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, Golden Freddy) Story: After a horrific nightmare about Freddy Fazbear's Spaghettiria, Mario has been having a feeling that something bad is gonna happen. And he's not wrong. Disappearances, murders, and violence had started happening around the Mushroom Kingdom ever since a new arcade opened up called Freddy Fazbear's Spaghetti and Tech. What dark secrets are hiding in the shadows? Who is Glitchtrap and what does he know about Mario (He probably knows about his secret intelligence)? And most importantly, where do they get their sauce for the spaghetti? Wait... 🐻🐰🐔🦊
Get ur Here Within A Day Ticket Here! I Claimed Mine, grants access to the V.I.P Room
1:46 - IPC
Truth be told a luigi gardening game would be can of cool. I would love to grow weird mario world plants or plant animals things. It'll would be real funny I could fight another person gardening XD
Mario leaving with lawyer Kong was just then ending to meta runner season 1
1:31 That's not funnny.
congratulations on 6M Subscribers SMG4!
Loved this one, WOOOOO 6 MIL
Meggy: "What about luigi"? Mario and SMG4: "ehh"  Weegiepie: 😥
At least this video was a joke about smg4 getting sued unlike           Sml
Maggie lawyers skills are very good in this episode
Got the whole squad laughing 🗿🗿🗿🗿
Are you actually on probation with Nintendo, or is this just a random animation?
Is this an arc?
Attack on Nintendo
MAMAAAAAAAA
I gues luigi is going to brazil
this feels like an anime but in smg4 style and way
Either Mario wins and is allowed to stay within the SMG-verse or he gets killed and Marvin and Luis take over
I love the references
i love that animating style thats you make keep ut the good work
congrats on 6mil subs!!
i hope nintendo gives meggy her very own game "MEGGY'S QUEST TO THE LAKE OF WISH" meggy goes on a quest to find a magic lake with a genie in it given three wishes meggy needs to find the lake to wish back desti and axol, return to her inkling self and the final wish...the last one she has to think of. but there are bad guys that are after the lake to make their own wish and we all know it's not good they might use the wish to rule the world, and meggy is up face to face agaisnt the most powerful being in ten worlds and in this one i hope and believe that in the final battle meggy will finally become every evils worst nightmare, for she is the light in the dark, she is the justice that came to those who cry for help, defend her friends, family and one loves and the weak from those who hurt them, she is the badass of awesomeness, she is the legend thats been asleep within her awaken by rage and fury, pure of heart, alley to good nightmare to evil, SHE IS THE ONE AND ONLY LEGENDARY PHOENIX WARRIOR MEGGY SPLETZER!
No smg4 run!!
2:23 Butt Ninja? :0
6 million subscribers  LET'S GOOOO!!
Bro I was gonna cry when they were gonna take Mario away
:smg4Cool:
Mario and meggy’s friendship is not over
New Arc?!?
I honestly thought this would be the start to a Nintendo arc until the twist at the end
did get sued by nentendo
Wow , first SML got sued and now SMG4?!
Luigi Gardening doesn't sound that bad for a game.
They will release him when they’re done with the game… right
Law. Hmmmm anyone watching a Korean drama about law?
NOOOOoOOoOOOOOooOOOO MARIO
This man, can make anything funny, no matter what
No but seriously Mario is getting smarter every video we see.
Ok but what about an actual  "Super Mario Bros. 5" ?
OMG THE ANIMATION IS SO GOOD, KEEP IT UP MY MAN
THAT KNOCK GOT ME THINKING SOMEONE WAS KNOCKING ON MY WINDOW
East to treat
Reminds me of what happened to SML
6 MIL BITCHES!!!!!!
Air
YOOO DONKEY KONG HAS PAGES THAT CAN CONTROL PEOPLES ACTIONS ACCORDING TO THE LAW ITS A JOJO REFERENCE OMGOMGOMGOMGOGMOGMOGMOMG   (for real tho i have a feeling that we may get some jojo references in the next arc, even though im not much of a fan of jojo)
i'm thie only one who shiping Mario with Megy ?
You finally got 6 million subs!
You had us there smg4 I thought you were going to delete your channel for real.
Great animation!  Hope this is another arc
funny thing is he never actually got sued
Damn this happened to Jeffy also lol
Congratulations on 6m subs
Hi Mario don’t use his drip mode?
Congratulations on 6 mil bro been watching u since the 5th grade
Smg4’s entertained me for 5 years. And how far he’s evolved, I’ve always loved it
Das ist das Ende was ich mir schon seit Jahren Wünsche👍🏻 Von mir aus kann die Story auch hier unten, denn ich frage mich schon lange wie smg4 alleine merchandise verkaufen kann ohne die Lizenzen von Nintendo.
ACTUAL THING:   Nintendo: “you stole a splatoon character and made a show off her and sold merch of a character that we owned”  Smg4: “oh…”
Hello
gamer
SML: First time eh?
New arc?                                        ᴵ ᵍᵘᵉˢˢˀ
Wow
On the bright side to all this, Luigi gets another solo game
BRUH IS THERE A REASON THAT DOOR AUDIO HAD TO SOUND LIKE IT WAS KNOCKING ON MY WINDOW IRL ☠️ ☠️
8:39 why are you so evil?!
Who knew Mario had such mad fighting skills
Did he actually get suad
I have a feeling this is a start for the  NINTENDO ARC
Congrats for 6 millon subs
Congrats on 6M
I fear the day when nintendo decides to really come for Mario.
There's too much fighting going on and not enough Mario being stupid... Unsub
Hey, 6 million subs! Congrats SMG4! I’ve loved your channel since day 1 and I hope you continue to make these amazing videos!!
I love miyamoto w brook´s voice
This is the most sad vid yet
Luigi can't catch a break, can he?
TBH knowing Nintendo, I'm suprised they didn't copyright you when you started this channel. But if they let you use Mario characters this long hopefully they will continue to let you because this "show" is amazing and I don't want you to have to stop before you finish this masterpiece.
Funny seeing references that I've seen or am going to happen in videos
10:06 It's now the Weegeepie's Problem
Lawyer Kong A menace
Okay, this is more like it. Mario finally isn't tortured, and instead, his friends are HELPING him.
i just love the fact that this video is partly based on the meta runner season 1 storyline
OMG OUR BOI HIT 6 MIL YESSSSSSSSSSSS
I feel like this is based on real events.
Brooooo I played Super Luigi Gardening and let me just say, best game ever- Anyone else make it to the super secret Chain Chop garden? Man was that a quite a level                If you cant tell Im joking-
Such smooth animation!
Congratulations on 6 million Subscribers!
The f- bruh
I feel like Nintendo lets SMG4 use their characters cause they bring so much popularity to the Mario games and love watching them
Is this a joke or real
Luigi's gardening sounds like an actual Nintendo game that came before like Mario 64 lol
Well done for getting 6 Million subscribers!  I’m honestly presently surprised that Nintendo hasn’t terminated this channel yet! I mean just look at Super Mario Logan, was just a tragedy.
uh oh meggy's a splatoon character so therfore she should also be owned by nintendo
i clicked on the video liked (Saul Goodman) disliked (because smg4 gettin sued) and liked (for content) again
This is the sickest episode ever. bro like this is amazing. Also when will mario have voice actor?
7:57 where nuke?
But bro! What about Luigi?!
Noice SMGFOOOOOOUR next year you will possibly reach 7M subs and GET 100M SUBS one day knowing that you had came this far from so long ago (but not to long ago) to today I hope that Covidmageddon (which Is a made up name i said) will end at some point in the far future
nEw ArC lEaK????!!@!
ARE YOU ACCTALY GETING SUED ?
Luigi, being mario's brother and meggy, being a splatoon character :
I thought this was a mario goodbye video
The next episode is going to be smg4 gets sued irl
Me vs layer Kong Me "under mushroom kingdom decree number 53 Wich is a new one you don't have lawyer power here" Lawyer Kong "ah crap"
So sad!
did you actually get sued? god i hope not.
WHEN IS SUPER LUIGI GARDENING COMING OUT?
one day meggy will overpower nintendo by becoming the one thing they fear most, the legendary phoenix warrior!
Happy 6 Mil SMG4!!!
Nahhh bro when did she go to law school holy jeebus
7:20 AHHH A FURRY
Congrats on making to 6,000,000 Subscribers SMG4 👍🏽✨
I hope there will be an anniversary and congrats to 6 M sub

BULL IS THE SPIDER 🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️🕷️
4:46 as always MEGGY IS AWESOME TOTAL BADASS!
HAHAHAHA
Congratulations on your 6 million subscribers, SMG4!!!!!!
Poor Street Fighter 5 Guile Theme..............
i like how, this can literally happen if he keep getting famous by doing coontent using nintendo characters
All jokes aside, it's only a matter of time until Nintendo begins hammering down on them to delete the videos and use different characters. Now I see why so many characters are getting plot development in the form of new models and designs, is to prepare for the day nintendo strikes again.
You are  getting sude
2:29 pov: you caught the belt
"There hasnt been a new game" Bowsers fury: am i a joke to you?
wait a second doesnt Miyamoto sound like brook?
nobody care about luigi wow
To be honest I would like to see that type of game
i hope you making 6Mil collab video
Ok but imagine that they actually announce another Mario Game
Imagine That Happens Fr
I Love this moments with mario and meggy the fight and meggy as she tries to hold Mario's hand as Mario leaves the group
What's about Luigi-
Nice job on 6m Smg4 YOU ARE SUPER GOOD
CONGRATS ON 6MIL SUBS!!!!!!!!!!!
I just remembered that Mario has... The drip and could have used it to win ez pz but Mario is is also -69420 so normal he didnt use it
🎉You evolve smg4!! Congratulations!!👍👍🥳🥳🎉
2:16 3:14 5:44 The power of law...sucks. 6:05 Oh yeeeeaah. She was a lawyer once.
Brook voice
Just asking but when will you do War Of The Fat Italians 2022

kung fu panda 4 ti’s coming in 2024 🥳👍🎉
Best. Ending. Ever.
Better Call Saul
Try get to 7mill
The PRODUCTION QUALITY ON THIS ONE, god damn!
Awesome episode, i love it😁
Yes eh hahaha💯💯💯
Animation is fire, story is still fire, THE GARDENING GAME IS FIRE.
Congrats on 6 mill subs i dont know wjy but youtube keeps unsubing me from some channels that i am subbd too
the 2 worst things from any company is a cease and desist or a DMCA
Poor mario
as an ace attorne fan,  meggy's objections are pretty good
what an amazing video SMG4 was the greatest thing I saw, maybe it's not the continuation of clown day but I liked it anyway, that's why you're my inspiration, keep it up SMG4 ^__^
Omg don't 🚫🚫🚫🚫 now
Sup
Did you actually get sued?
does anyone realise forcing a living person to do something is slavery (i think)  thus nintendo is breaking multiple laws
GREAT, FIRST SML AND NOW SMG4😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬😠
Funky Kong was my favorite Donkey Kong character until this
Hi
5:45 ah piss
I thought the game would be called Luigi’s Gardening Simulator?
There is nothing in the world that can stop smg4 from making videos, his channel will continue to live and expand till the end...
meggy becoming cringe
If Nintendo can be a little bit more creative Luigi gardening could be a fun thing not gonna lie
Meggy is god!
Uh oh the higherd strength is mad
1:59 scream
Oh yea she a lawyer I forgot about that
Did meggys animation improve?
ahh the classic Old Mario jump
let's go he's hit 6M subs (we still gotta get him to 10M tho)!
I really do wonder how Nintendo hasn't actually done something like this, yet.
Holy that was a twist that almost scared me when donkey Kong said he hade to stop making videos and I e been a fan sence like almost 4 YEARS NOW!
I was the first 100 subs and this vid is super funny also good job on 6 million  have a good day
Congrats with the 6 Mil, like the animation difference in the second half.
this could be foreshadowing in the future and it scares me
*Arc please*
Nobody cares luigi f in the chat
Congrats on 6M!
(:
2:35
Welp at least Luigis happy
Here's a comment for the algorithm
SMG4 FOREVER!!!
I was so scared when I saw the thumbnail
Same thing happend to sml
congrats with 6 mil subs bro
He got sued?
The fact this could actually happen is terrifying.
3:05 rip
Wait a sec. SMG4 mario isn't regular mario, so this makes no sense
Hey there smg4 how you doing
I can't stop laughing at SMG4 screaming at 5:21 Also, congrats for 6 million subs
But wait. Did he deal with this already similar like a couple of years ago and why is this person suing him what did he do it’s just perfectly fine
This is quality entertainment
6 million !!!
69 Is fun
is this gonna be the next wotfi trilogy xD
Yo. When the next arc? Can we get a legal arc? Take what happened in this episode and run with it?
2:10 Mario is packing
He gave nintendo an idea and they like it
I think I have a feeling that there would be a new arc for war of fat Italians and congrats for 6m dude
perfectly encapsulates the actions of nintendos legal team
I thought he’s serious s with being sued thank god
*The Nintendo Ninjas are coming for you*
I loved this, great work capturing how we see Nintendo as a corporation
it does a little something for everyone
Ight, time to add depression the clown and lawyer Kong to the list
This was 2 hours ago
YHAOO WITH GUN!
SMG4: Bout to get sued SML: First time?
Gud now we have brook from one piece
6 million gg
Uh oh
Remember that one episode where smash will pass was happening and then they got a cease and desist letter and Mario went ah piss
It's a good thing Mario could stay with you SMG4 at least they took Luigi for a new game
Did this actually happen to you, like did Nintendo and you and a little conversation?????
How the hell did the episode about legal ownership over Mario have the best animation I’ve ever seen
0:45 i though someone knocked my door l
Always so good to see the Mario and Meggy duo
Trying to laugh at SMG4 challenge impossible
Congrats 6 milion subs!🥳
3:57 YAHOO with gun
Lol the ending
I am loving the new TF2 sounds! They need to add more content!
This was an interesting episode. I liked it
Felicidades de los 6 millones smg4. Mis saludos 👍🔥😎💙
Just one question did you get sued in real life
GOOD VIDEO SMG4, YOU ARE ONE OF THE BEST OF THE INTERNET
See? Is it really that hard to make something without making it horrifying and plain rotten?
Wait are u actually  getting sued
My man did not just play the digimon world 2 battle theme at 6:50. amazing taste
SMG4 Never fails to entertain us
6m moment
super luigi gardening 10/10
2:18 Spell Card: RESTRAINING ORDER
Omg ggg 6m suscribed
6M subs 🥳 🎉
ligma
To 6 Million subs SMG4, you are a one of a kind YouTuber for this generation
OMG U HAVE 6M SUBS
so is this the beginning of the nintendo arc?  Edit: I guess not... Goodbye Luigi
I thought about this before video
wa
aww man he ot sued
Eh? EH?
i would play "Super Luigi Gardening"
after super mario logan's sue, i was expecting this to happen, but we cant clearly tell when it will.
Why meggy is gigachad
holy shit imagine if lawyer kong was in smash his special moves would all be related to legal documents lmao restraining order would be a powerful kill move probably
is he really got sued?
Ide play Luigi's Gardening. That kind of sounds cool. Like water gardens and garden hang outs.
Congrats on 6 mil, SMG4!
Sonic.exe: hey you think about join Nintendo are best
How neato would it be if Nintendo's security guards had weapons that just so happen to look like their consoles' controllers?
Miyamoto: Cut! Mario doesn't use guns! Ubisoft: And who decided that!?
5:58 I love the callback to when Meggy attended Law School years ago. She did do very well in that course if I recall correctly.
do stupid mario plays the mortuary assistant
6 MILLION SUBS SPECIAL?????
I think he leading us to a Nintendo vr.s smg 4 wotif and the Nintendo arc
Law and order
Find then why does Mario watch Nintendo memes
Okay what just happened is there going to be an arc soon
E
Is this the Nintendo arc
MARIO X MEGGY IS CONFIRMED THEY ARE GF AND BF
I honestly got scared for a moment
Wow! A 6 million subscribers special is Awesome!
Les go 6 mil subs
Can we get back to the Clown Arc?
Just more evidence to add to the “depressed arc” theory. Yet again we get a mainline smg4 episode with Mario as a crucial character, and someone (Mario again) being miserable. This really suggests that by the end of this arc, Mario’s either gonna battle his inner demons or just kill himself. @SMG4, what do you think?
This reminds me of Sml getting sued by Nintendo
Noooo first sml now it’s smg4 😭😭😭😭
First the crazy clown, now lawyer Kong, Who's going to be this arc's villain?
MEGGYS SOUNDS DIFFERENT
Your animation keeps getting better i love it!
as someone who knows actually a decent amount of law I can tell that the terms used by lawyer kong are actually real. good job SMG4. you really did your research.
👏
This was defininetly a more interesting SMG4 plot than usual.  After what happened to SML last year, I can see why SMG4 was scared out of his mind with the Nintendo fiasco.  It was funny though since the channel will more than likely not have the same fate as SML did.  If SMG4 would get a DMCA this video would probably be like the one SuperMarioLogan uploaded July 7 last year
6:19 but what about the bombs you just used
Happy 6MIL, SMG4
I actually thought about an episode of nintendo sueing smg4 for having mario characters.
59m subscribers
I love Luigi gardening!!!
is mr nintendo ceo aware that call of duty is on there consoles also  doom and fortnite and paladins and overwatch so mario with a gun ain't to far fetched
Like Come on it would off happed SMG4 your copied nintendo
THEY TOOK SML THEY CANT TAKE SMG4 TOO
The animation in this specifc video are soo smoof
This honestly sounds like something Nintendo would do.
It's times like these when I forget Meggy is a lawyer.
If Nintendo takes this down. It’s canon
The fact that for 5 years they never thought Mario was in Peach's castle amazes me
Congrats on 6m meggy saved the day
I that nod to back when Meggy was a lawyer. Also, I wonder if Lawyer Kong and Depresso would join forces, since it seems like they'll both be back.
Used to watch this stuff in 2019 and I gotta say the animation has gotten way better! Got caught because of how funny this was one night sneaking my phone
So funny 😁🤣
Love the reference to Nintendo ninjas not a lot of people know about them
Something tells me that lawyer kong will return.
Yo ice 🧊 ⛸️
damn Lawyer Kong is willing to keep SMG4 from doing his job as a Super meme guardian just so Mario makes a new game. really shows that some lawyers got some real dark magic to do what they want.
Wow🤩
I think Gardening simulator with luigy would be da blue shell
My friend predicted this, damn
mom
Congratulations on the 6 million subscriber SMG4! You've been at inspiration for all of us and I hope you will continue making funny memes years to come 🎉🎉
6 million special
The SuperMarioLogan situation in a nutshell.  It's not his fault at all, but since the Nintendo cease and desist, his video haven't been the same. I really hope one day he can (find a way to) use the Mario plushies again...
For a moment i tought they wer going for meggy to launch splatoon 3 or somenting...   P.s. the new idols are kinda creepy, even more than pearl at its beginnings...
Why are your thumbnails so serious and the videos so random and funny
IS DIS A NOO ARC??
fUNNEY
Weird how none of the other Nintendo-based characters showed up, let alone were recalled.   Great reference at the end to controversies around IGN review clichés though.
-_- why mario would go to jail he did nothing wrong
Mario is soo rude
Theory: this is the going to be another arc and Mario will probably get a redesign for merchandising.
2:23 WII nunchucks
You hit 6mill btw
rip smg4
Is this wotfi 2022
MEGGY'S THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who ever said this will never be sued pay up
Based on real events
This is Sml all over again
9:20 the scene would have been cooler if Mario suprise attacked lawyer Kong and ripped apart the paper that he had. reguardless, I like the video!
You see, I hate it when you get sued SMG4. When I want to make a video that  includes a character that I didn’t originally create to make them do what I feel like I want them to do. I would make the description say that I don’t originally own the character or the franchise it came from. I would also and the copyright © act saying in the description so I don’t get sued.
Oh nvm
super luigi gardening actually sounds like a good game ngl
I died from Mario's and SMG4's reaction when Meggy asked about Luigi xD. Mario & SMG4: Eh... Me: But still though, Eh...
Congratulations on 6 million been a long time fan of the channel and seeing it grow warms my heart
mario x meggy shippers, assemble !
Say it with me y'all.     *NEW*    *STORY*      *ARC*
The end of SMG4.
10:15 sound effect link?
The ending 😂😂
i love playing Old Nintendo games.
I sense an Ark coming up
OH!!! 7:35
This made me like SMG4 Mario better than regular Marip
Hey just curious has Nintendo ever tried to sue your channel? Or how do u avoid them from sueing u?
Lawyer Kong looks and sounds like Funky Kong!
Gotta say, I’ve expected this
That nearly scared me, also no one is going to play super Luigi gardening cause what would even be the plot
Mario withs guns!*
Oh boy.
Lmao 🤣 that ending
The animation in this episode holy COW this is one of your best!
I remember the Time were SMG4 "only" had 3 Million Subs and now its doubled kinda insane how the Time goes bye
wow how I improve the animation smg4 congratulations for reaching 6 million
lol
Isn't Meggy owned by Nintendo as well technically?
If mario was in pokemon pls
Congratulations for the 6 million. Your videos are incredible.
Well...
But why smg4 is still alive like yea is cool but its rare that after 10 year the channel is still there
1:35 So True, lately nintendo were make some boring ass games
Hello everyone this is GigaChad Reviews, and today we're gonna be reviewing SMG4: SMG4 Gets Sued:  Now, this is a forgettable episode for me, so I'm gonna make this short as possible because of how bad it is.  This episode was painful, atleast the only best thing in this episode was Meggy caring about Mario, which we rarely get these days since Meggy is always abusing Mario. A few jokes could have worked if they did correctly, and they did not. I liked the ending with the Nintendo Team going for Luigi instead because he was gardening. Nonetheless this episode was painful because of one thing, Lawyer Kong's annoying TTS voice. It's so painful that characters that was made for TTS voices (Swagmaster, Chris, Hal Monitor, etc.) aren't so painful as that characters that DON'T need TTS Uberduck voices. That's all I have to say.   This episode is pretty forgettable, it's not bad but painful and annoying.    I rate this one:  5/10 or 4/10
SMG5 when?
Do a 6 million video :^
👍👍 yes
I expect a Ace Attorney reference.
LOOOLOLLO
you always make content that i love
Speaking of speechless which one is the first time we hear her va being different english I feel like there are 2 different va's
Even after 6 years of watching smg4 content, it's only gotten better and better <3
Let me guess… doc levels
This video is great
Why i waiting super Luigi gardening 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
If Luigi Gardening was a thing, I Guarantee it would sell a lot
Bro that door knocking genuinely thought someone was actually knocking on the other side of my wall
Does this mean luigi won't be in any videos for a while?
Yes.
Happy 6 million subscribers smg4
ONO
lawyer kong kinda reminds me of that one paper stand guy from jojo part 4
For a moment I thought Funky was going to have control of Meggy too, because, you know, she used to be an Inkling
Image if Nintendo Sued This
Smg4 did you actually get sued
This is a really funny video even funnier then the rest
I thought you were already, are it just happened..... it's a good idea follow Nintendo
2:02 can someone tell me the name of that song please
Wow that's a better metacritic score then most Sonic games...
*Ain’t no way.*
u nu
6:46 wth mario actually lands??
It's the best non-arc video of year for me.
The End of SMG4
I'm going to say to the next video that you make
I sure hope the SMG4 YouTube channel doesn't get deleted. That would make every SMG4 die-hard fan very, very sad. The Glitch Productions team does extremely well with avoiding copyright issues from Nintendo.   Without SMG4, there would be no Mario, no meme characters, and no Glitch Productions. To all of the 6M subscribers watching, let's give a BEEG salute to our favorite YouTube channels, SMG4 and Glitch Productions.
Congrats on 6 mil, Luke and crew! Your videos have gotten the internet through some of their toughest times! Thank you for brightening the darkest moments of many childhoods and adulthoods! You guys will always have a place in our hearts! 🙏🏻💞💞🤩🤩
Smg4 I have came to make an announcement
Poor Mario always getting bullied by people
Congrats smg4 for 6 M subs
Smg4 has gotten the characters movement amazed I'm like speechless dawg
i mean, better call saul i guess
👏👏😊😊😂😂😂
Y todos le joden con el shippeo
Wheres the mario roasting video
this took a long time
For smg4
Ya 210,000th viewer on the vid
I smell a Wotfi brewing
If I was asked "what's the thing that gave you the best rollercoaster of emotions?" I would say-  A ten minute video about a guy getting sued for using a copyrighted figure over 700 times by a world-famous company
SMG3 make more video plsssss
I thought you guys actually got sued LOL
Damn ima buy super Luigi gardening
I love your videos🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕😝🤣
congrats on 6M thats one huge accomplishment well done ive been watching since mid 2018 and to see u then and see u now is really something special
Copyright is so scary and it only helps big companies
Mario better call Saul
I kinda wanted to see what the world of SMG4 would be like without Nintendo properties.
This is so true!
That’s a so nice
If mario was in poppy playtime chapter 2 please make
Miyamoto with Brook noises gives me life
Well that’s what happens when u use copyrighted characters
6milll!!!!!!!!!!!(!
Did you actually get sued
e
Ayyyy at least Luigi likes being in his game
Is it a new arc beginning?
Buen trabajo sigue así 👌
nintendo made golden eye 64, and theres guns in that game. so the ak47's are nintendo items.
this will probably be the start of another arc
Haven't seen that many law ninja since elf kingdom vs thief 2002
5:27 TheInvertedShadow awesome :)
6mil!!!!!!!!!!!
The Nintendo arch?????👀👀
i wonder if ur gonna make movies about this. are u?
6:40 I recognized this song and couldn't think from where, went through my life's history to find it from when I played Digimon World 2 on the first Playstation
After SML, will SMG4 get deleted?!
wow. very good episode
That fight with Nintendo minions was awesome
Hello It’s A Me Monke!
Smg4 has turned into an anime
Smg4 I will help u make the next video I will do some ideas Mario wakes up and is in green computer again as he say what WHY AM I HERE AGAIN and then the text type hello Mario nice to see you then it types honestly I am impressed
I'm glad Mario can stay with you guys..................But He's still geting Court-martial.
when you play super mario bros wii with a realy shaky hand : 7:28
Was that a meta runner reference??!!
Awwesomeeeeee
Mario you’re fine without your friends, they treated you like a piece of shit.
This is the literal representation of nintendos legal team
well done Luke, hit the 6m sub milestone!
"No guns this is a nintendo game" Kirby and the Forgotten Land ranger ability: 👀
I just thought it was creative with the nentendo weapons
Please let luigi come back I miss him already 😪
Another banger done by smg4 😎🔥💯
But doesn’t Mario love his dad Miyamoto ?       Also congrats on 6M you beautiful person
SUED
rt games : im going to do the last episode of phenix wright t&t and im done with the ace attorny seris me, who got sucked into act attorny due to him being a funny in the videos : where am i going to get law based stupidity? smg4 :
You...ARE making sure you aren't copyrighting right? Like, Nintendo is known to take down even the little of fan games, such a yt channel would bring upon quite the stir at nintendo...this video is just a joke, right?     RIGHT?!?!
Don't worry you can still use sonic Sega doesn't mind about you making sonic fan games so you're completely safe
Who can agree that smg4 is a tad bit better than sml
More videos please just one more and I'll put more likes
Its amazing how mario and meggy fighted off those infinite amount of gaurds, nice vid bro keep it up!👍
Poor Donkey...
Is it just me, or did Meggy's voice change? Did i miss a memo or something?
So You Can Still Make More Videos Right?
Did you get sued
6 million subs congratulations smg4
nintendo better not sue you
sorry bee chapter, now there is a new favorite XD
Awesome way to make more videos since hit his 6M mark…
deffo got meta runner season 1 finale vibes when mario was going to go with lawyer kong
Noone wants poor luigi . . . This is a joke .
6 million Subscribers for old Fans SMG4🥳
That was quite speedy
Character entering godmode: MEGGY and Mario
Woo 6M
should have made a super luigi odyssey
Eh who cares about Luigi let him garden
It will most likely lead to a arc that ends with WOTFI 2022… BUT THAT’S JUST A THEORY, A GAME THEORY
O é
Why does this feel like the start of a new arc, other than that amazing video as always
SMG4: *the copyright ARC*
RIP SMG4
Ay first off, congratulations on 6 mil and so insane to see how far you've come really. Second, and this is more of a personal curiosity but I wonder if Nintendo ever did try to sue one of your videos. I mean it wouldn't make sense, but it's just something I've wondered.
is dis real 😳
F
spide meggy. spider meggy. does what ever she fucking does. shoots a gerande of ink at people. watch out! she has a gun in her hand.
I reaally lrlike the ace attorney hild it
Is this the beginning of the new arc 😮
congrats on getting 6mil smg4
SIKE THEY DONT DIE AHHAHAHA😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Mario plays among us
Congrats on 6 mil, I hope you don't get removed by YouTube and if you do, you'll be in all our hearts
Its smells like a new arc
Oh my god soooooooo good
Congrats on 6 Million, SMG4.
Smg4 what is the best Editing software do you recommend
well you have an old death sounds right, so what about new death sounds smg4 that's how fans makes happy right
Congrats for 6M btw🎉🎉🎉
mario : yahoo me : gun mario : YAHOO. WITH GUN tm !! me : im a god damn comedy genius
Omg, the characters are so well animated ! I love the Ragdoll side of smg4 but with more animation it's just amazing 🤩 you definitely deserve the 6 million subscribers, keep it on !
I would play Super Luigi Gardening
Blub
Oh no smg4
How you make Mario stupid
Cool video i like the editons
There is a simple way to bring back Luigi just summon him out of the deepest pits of hell
3:45
Geez this had me going nuts will this be the plot of the next wotfi maybe
Uhhyhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Smg4 make a big mistake
I feel like lawyer Kong could make a return and is an interesting villain. Also this video was really great and funny lol
The butt ninja has returned!
Why do I get the feeling this the start of another Arc?
Tbh I thought SMG4 actually got sued for a moment, thank god you’re still with us.
Lawyer kong is basically Phoenix Wright that’s has to use everything in court especially in property that they own
the wii part got me XD
that battle music... i haven't played that game in years
And smg4 continues have no b!tches
Meggy and Mario would make a great couple
Anything about luigi: Eh
0/10 too political
Congrats on 6 million subscribers SMG4 you are da best
No
congrats for 6M !!!
The Phoenix Wright references are perfect and on point
cronglatulations on hitting 6M! That’s very happy:D
Is this the new arc? If it is it’s probably the Nintendo arc
Luigi get famous and Mario get lazy
nintendo is evil
Early
Happy 6 million! Love your vids!! 😂😂
Mario everyday: the lord of smg4 that fear nothing Mario this episode: i guess someone going to [CUT] mario banana
NOOOO
But don’t they own splatoon
Like how both Mario and SMG4 said eh XD
Is he actually getting sued by nintendo
This was the best episode I’ve ever seen, it was amazing, the SMG4 gang actually wanted mario and the fighting was *chef kiss* Pefection!
nice last video
Luis Yepez Founder: cool video
This has got to be one of the best uses of the mystery box ever.
Good job on 6 mil SMG4! You actually never fail to entertain me, but when I first looked at the title, *I DIED INSIDE*
What's this? An actual budget for a meme video?! NANI?!?!
me : i had a dream where there were pikmin in real life for some reason. how was your dream? my friend : 0:07
5:27 THIS LOOKED TOO DAM SMOOTH
Are companies like Nintendo this dumb enough to not realize it's Copyright if it's fair use? If it has no real connection to the actual Mario canon, and is made for things like jokes, then it's legal!
Really?
Nintendo has a lot of sue-ing issues that don’t make sense, let’s be honest.
what would happen if mario was in Jet Force Gemini, another nintendo 64 game
eggs
Ok, but I would buy a peaceful gardening game for the switch
I love the animations edit: warning: the big man has been reincarnated and is en route to the castle, along with every single agent.
What does sued mean?
There's Blue Toads in the castle!?!?
The Cipher: This was a - 900K/ 10 for laughter. Your vids are going down the damm drain! Be funny like the old day's.
Yes
SPECIAL VIDEOS 6M SUCRIBERS
OH SHIII-
I’m quite surprised Nintendo didn’t do this yet, we all know how petty that company can be, and this guy has been doing it for 10 years
And everyone is happy in the end.
Don’t you have a cop right you do use it if not I feel bad for you man
And nothing of value was lost.
I wonder if this actually happened or if its just another funny meme thing
i’m sure nintendo is happy that SMG4 exists since everytime he makes a video about a new nintendo game he’s basically advertising it for free i guess.
Idea! If Mario was in poppy playtime chapter 2
At least luigi is player one again
The Fucking Mario saga has been born...
Funky Kong is the lawyer?! Nintendo does own funky Kong now but it was created by Rare.
Really, it's a miracle they haven't sued you yet.
smg4 it's simple, just sue them back/j
I’m convinced that Lawyer Kong is a real character in the Nintendo universe and he’s the background handling all the legal stuff for the Kongs.
nintendo taking Mario for his casting in the super Mario Bros movie with Jack black
Smg4: get nintendo characters and turn them into an multi dimenson entity Just smg4: fear of nintendo will get him back Nintendo: i give up, take him back
Let’s hope you don’t go down like how sml did
Super Luigi Gardening?   IT’S A GODDAMN MASTERPIECE
You are the Best Smg4 Gooooooo
1 h ago  keep up the amazing worl
We all love you and mario smg4
DOKTOR TURN OF MY CRINGE INHIBITORS- BUT SMG4 YOU'LL LOOSE SUBSCRIBER
congrats on 6m
Bro I loki got scared seeing the title
congratulations on the 6 million subs, we always will love your videos
I forgot meggy was a lawyer
Bring back old saiko design new one looks like cringe
To be honest they still have the glitch channel and luigi on the come up
The frickin ign review got me
Fun Fact : If you tell people ‘fun fact’ in the comments of a video, everybody will read your supposed ‘fun fact’.
Meggy is owns by ninentedo to
all fun and games until smg4 actually gets sued
Why does this feels like some work for Wotfi 2022
Just like to sml super Mario Logan
Defenetly kid show
Alternate Title: If Mario Was In... Ace Attourney
I knew this has to do with Nintendo
Nintendo doesn't even know that SMG4's other shows exist
Congrats on 6m subs
Glad to see a callback to Meggy's law degree from Mario University
in this episode we can see that smg4 has improved in animation once again
I almost cried but when Myamoto came at the castle I was like “wait what”
God
Amazing video, congrats on 6 million subs, you deserve it for the quality of your content. Keep up the good work.
Good news: If Luke ever gets told to stop with Nintendo characters, he doesn’t have to change the names. Mario is an Italian name. Luigi is an Italian name. Not Nintendo names. Bowser, Daisy, Peach, Toad, & probably a ton more names I’m forgetting, aren’t Nintendo names. The models will likely be the only thing that will have to change.  Edit: I changed the comment so it wouldn’t say “Mario is an Italian name. Not a Nintendo name. Same with Bowser, Daisy, Luigi, & probably a ton more names I’m forgetting.” I did this because of confusion that was caused by my original wording.
Ur awsome
heres the easy way of fixing this (backspace)
I thought there was a sequel that mario friend save him
Damaging it is a real game
10:16 what is that sound effect from
Happy 6k subs
2023: Nintendo sues itself, goes bankrupt.
F
Congrats smg4 for 6million subs🥳
Is this a cease and desist?
I can see the animation is getting insanely better
The reason SMG4 can't get sued is because his videos are created as a parody which protects them under the laws of article 13 so it's perfectly legal, even if Nintendo insists otherwise.
06:02 Lawner Meggy strikes again... (Well... Sorta)
Another ark?
I honestly thought they were going to give Mario away because of what happened last episode and Mario would go insane again. I really can't get that whole freakout that Mario had out of my head XD.
Congrats on 6 million SMG4
Not gonna lie this one felt more real, due to Nintendo's iron grip on their properties
I have a feeling that an ark is coming.
Congratulations on 6 millions subscribes. You are my favourite YouTuber.
I thought he actually did get sued by nintendo
epic-sode.
Congrats on 6 million
A video that won’t actually happen in the real life XD.
Happy 6 mil:)
uhhhh  lawyer arc??  i'm only saying that because "this isn't the last you've seen of me"
Happy 6 Million Subscribers. Well. This really Sucks for you got sued by Nintendo.
Well to be fair, you probably could you a Wii remote like that
I have a feeling with these new characters being introduced (Depresso and Lawyer Kong) a new arc is about to begin. If so, prepare for a Super Smash brawl for the ages
No guns? Huh?  What about the rabbids crossover
4:22 and 5:58 Wow< this is Ace Attorney Rederence!
At least his friends care about him again
7:48 That was the cleanest thing I've ever seen
Anyone notice meggys voice change?
5:22 OMG MARIOS MOM REVEAL
Wow Meggy actually still likes Mario, shocker.
Meggy's name is now Yahoo. You'll never change my mind
Meggy is a good lawyer
here before 50K likes.
Serious question here but I have always wondered why Smg4 doesn't seem to get in trouble, despite how notorious Nintendo is regarding their copywrite.  Is he really only safe because hes in Australia? I mean yes Smg4 Mario is a Transformative parody, same as the rest of the cast..  But alot of the models, music, sets, and other assets are from Nintendo games so shouldn't that put him in hot water?
Please please make Mario play sonic.exe
Oh noooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Whats with the clown thever thing
I sense a new arc here...
Nice lore here bringing in laws into the universe form real life
Bruh if legal documents were like anime powers, law would me a LOT more interesting, if also more chaotic. Just shouting ‘Cease and Desist’ and suddenly Meggy gets magically restrained. Just wow…
This is the start of an arc isn’t it? Edit: I KNEW IT!
✨️🌌Guess we'll see Luigi someday🌌✨️
was that swag? love your videos, watching since the baldi video :)
W I T H G U N
SMG4 you are doing amazing content.
*A lawyer in a suit is nothing compared to a gun*
New arc?
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhh yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaeh
Poor smg4
I thought your gonna redesign mario
OH NO
FINALLY ANOTHER SMG4 VID!
Video Idea: SMG4’s journey on YouTube so far.
SMG4 did go wrong again? Sued...? At least Mario keeps the same.
I feel like we may be in an arc, or there might be an arc soon. Anyone else?
Love it
I feared this day would come
Smls backstory
For a second I thought Lawyer Kong would be the new antagonist😂
Nintnendo in a nutshell
8:50 Is Mario actually becoming a good person? Also I have to say these videos are getting better and better less rag doll walking better animation and all around better quality videos did I say better to much? Anyway keep up the good work smg4!
Mario: Exists Nintendo: Get in the van
bye :( (this is a joke) congrats on 6 mil!
Well it less Luigi can start having more game now
Poggers!
The NINTENDO arc
...Okayyyy. 😕  So anyway, anyone else miss the rest of the SMG4 cast? Belle? Rob? Whimpu? JubJub? Jeeves? Hal Monitor? Others to whose names none of you probably even remember anymore? 😟  ...Really? Not even the Teletubbies? ☹  Sigh...I hope Luke's 6 million subscriber special video will actually BE special because the Mario Does Stuff vids have gotten MUCH funnier than the main series as of late... 😞
Ceace and desist deez nuts!
Guys, I just noticed something. Why hasn't Nintendo launched a DMCA yet? It's because of the fans, right? US! If Nintendo tries to cancel SMG4, it'll have to answer to us, right? We're the ones paying Nintendo, and so the only people the company fears! Every time we watch an SMG4 video, we keep the channel alive!
I forgot that meggy was a lawyer until she got hit wit da cease and desist
no
Hold on this is the start of a new ark
smg4Cool
8:17 OH MY GOD IS META RUNNER
But what about Luigi odyssey?
CONGRATS FOR 6 MIL
I really wouldn’t mind an animal crossing and Luigi crossover. Sounds relaxing
IT FINALLY HAPPENED
Cool so when do sales sell super Luigi gardening 10:10
i swear to god if i see saul goodman im gonna fucking lose it
How much do you all want to bet they made this because they confirmed with Nintendo that they won’t attempt to sue them?
6M subs, nice! This kinda gives me vibes from what SML had to go through idk why
Where can I buy super Luigi gardening
He gained 1 mill subs in 9 months
Yoo this will result into a whole arch!
Meggy said Grenade
Yep, I knew this was going to happen.
Ya
This was an amazing episode, I hope SMG4 doesn't get a cease and desist in Real Life. Congrats on 6,000,000 subscribers as well.
Congratulations SMG4 from 1 sub to 6million wow good job : )
Ah finally. An episode for the lawyer that I am. Unfortuntely, im not in Interlectual Property Law.
Ngl, if Nintendo made a sort of Stardew Valley game with Luigi as the main character, I'd think it'd work
You guys finally got 6 million subscriber
And congratulations on hitting 6mmilliom
CONGRATULATIONS ON 6 MILLION SUBS🥳🥳 We are all proud of you
basically meta runner but mario
Meggy: but what about Luigi  Smg4: eh  Mario: eh ——————————————— That’s going to be my favorite line 🤣
This is not real
The most epic battles 2022
I would def play Super Luigi Gardenning!
The phrase "nintendo is an *entity* I cant make mad" raises a few questions
congrats on 6 million
The new voice actress for Meggy is really good :D
I did not know smg4 made a mario fangame
oh yeah, Meggy was a lawyer
Congratulations, you hit 6M.
pullin' out that top tier inverted shadow animation
Congrats on 6mil
Did u be sue
Поздравляю с шестью милионами!
Miyamoto with Brook's voice from One Piece is so funny XD
Ya era momento carajo
who won't play this new game ??
Happy 6 million
9:05 Mario X Meggy moment
MARIO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! you were my favorite D: F for respect. Ó╭╮Ò
0:46 when the knock happened I thought it was my door
Meggy is like me in Roblox kk
Parabéns SMG4 vc está com 6 milhões de inscritos
Luigi stays
6 M 👏
*This video has been taken down by Nintendo ™*
Yo smg4, been watching you for a while now, also congrats on 6 Million subscribers!
Oh yeah! I forgot Meggy went to law school! Mario University was a looooong time ago. Nice to see SMG4 acknowledge older episodes.
It's like SML all over again. I hope this isn't real
Just like with the Clown episode, I smell an arc brewing!
I guess Nintendo didn't realize that Meggy used a Splat-Bomb from Splatoon which is their Ip.
6M nice
I'll sue mario for stealing my liver
Well done on hitting 6 Million subscribers, Luke, you really never fail to entertain your fans!
Congratulations smg4 for reaching 6M SUBS, Hope you are going to enjoy having 7m soon 😊
you got sued ?
WATCH LAWYER KONG BE THE MAIN VILLAN OF THE NEXT ARC
Based on what I know Nintendo fine with smg4 they just asked him to make Mario stop cussing lol
Yay you got 6mil I knew you could do it and new arc alert
0:23
f bro, why do they sue you, RIP. *wait wha-*
I'm surprised Funky and the lawyers let the original cast not own by Nintendo stay in Peach's castle.
Hmmm light of lugui
Thank you for your vid because your vid helped me learn more grammar because I was so stupid and I showed it to my brother after he finished watching it, he took my phone and threw it in the trash :(
nintendo ninjas first i heard of them
Missed the chance to put Saul in, you Better Haved called Saul.
Are you really being sued?
Me getting flashbacks to SML...
Why is this kong a laywer, are there two of the same kongs?
Luigi actually enjoys it tho
Pls make super luigi gardening
only if it was meggy and splatoon 3 would will be out
Congrats on 6 million subscribers SMG4
okay for a second I legit almost thought we were about to get another Arc involving Getting Mario back from the State Government or something by using Copyright laws and Legal Stuff to get him back
Super Nintendo? nah this is Super Slaveryy
Did you actually get sued
Memes
SMG4’s the type of dude to if he actually got a cease and desist by Nintendo he’d just say “No.” then if there was a lawsuit he’d just lose and owe money but he’d still keep making the videos with Mario anyways even if.
Then Nintendo finds out that Mario is not himself, so they sent him to the brain scan. Eventually they cured Mario back to normal.
Meggy: "Those aren't Nintendo items." Meanwhile Bayonetta Bayonetta: "Guns!" Rodin: shrugs
I kcwew it then Mario going to kill Bowser with a gun
Imagine he actually gets sued lol Btw super Luigi gardening, best Mario game I’ve seen
Wait i just realize that you get 6m sub. Just wow (I'm Vietnamese so sorry if my English is bad)
We need nintendo meme 10
Happy ending and great the video teaches a little about law
Congrats on hitting 6 mil
So how the clown virus is fixed, or Is this a parellel timeline where It didn't happen
Meggy’s Animation quality was top notch.
congrats on 6mil
I might sound like a simp, but I'm so happy that Luigi is appearing in more SMG4 episodes, also he finally have a good ending for once! Also I hope we get more Luigi development! I love how he got another hobbie, and I hope he gets more, and I hope we get to see more of Luigi's powers and relationships with the others
Please make smg4 videos
Baaed on real events(?)
Imagine getting sued 😂😂😂  -SMG4’s last words
goddamn we just d9ged a bullet may the m3mes live fo4 ever
Is it weird that when Mario was about to leave smg4 I cried
Did anyone notice that smooth animation? Because I noticed that nice smooth animation. 😎👌
It fun to see how. this Chanel has grown I still remember fnaf and 2016 wotfa
SMG5🐍
...
In my opinion, this has gotta be one of the best episodes in terms of animation. It has just the right amount of seriousness and randomness
SMG4 < Mario odyssey 2
Hey smg4 I just wanna let you know that you just hit 6 million subscribers    so ur welcome 🤗 if u were happy about this 😉
I love how the Wii nunchuck was use as a nunchuck!
8:04 reference at wall e.
Did Meggy’s a voice actor change?
Finally!
Lawyer powers very cool
Woo 6 mill
Luigi gone:"and nothing of value was lost"
This is so well animated! I cannot believe how far you’ve come
LOL
It's real
that message from lawyer kong was ominous, new arc maybe?
MASDAK MEGGY??
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Geez man, I thought this was an IRL thing. Don’t scare us like that.
Didn’t you make this before??? I’m not even gonna ask nevermind
Congratulations on getting to 6 million subscribers Meme Lord!
8:53
Why does Mario have white buttons instead of yellow buttons,
شكرا 🌹
Lawyer Kong said that Mario hasn't seen the last of him. Do I smell a new arc incoming?
i can’t wait to play SLG
I have to say that, after a lot of critics for the last episode, this really goes up the things.  Besides, the animations look very good and fluid, now are not only the characters moving up and down.
Lawyer Kong next big bad calling it
j
SMG4 gets sued Me: I'll go get meggy.
scp 173 guard snap neck ayo?
HII
YESS
Luigi becomes famous
Super Luigi gardening for Cameron Taylor?
Early  🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🏅🎖
Congrats on 6 million subscribers, keep up the content.
Why is Meggy and Mario the best duo ever
😂
Congratulations of 6 millions sub,Smg4!
first part of vid:OH NO SUED. middle part of vid:mario has gun and meggy saves him almost end:EMOTIONAL PART :( now really end:Eh
*what if Mario went through his own arc on being a better friend?*
Luigi's only going to cry later.
NINTENDO ARC PLS
I love your videos
I hope smg4 doesn’t get sued next
So funny
i feel like this could be the start of a new arc
Congratulations on 6 million subscribers ❤️💙🤍
Well, this video was inevitable.
hi
I feel like this could be shown in law school as a video students actually would enjoy.
I see a new arc insuing…  EDIT: YES. IT. WAS.

0:24 my god that pikmin!!!!!
me: *sees the title* also me: nice
YAYYYYYY  lol lol
Happy that you got 6 millions subscribers, SMG4! I'll still support you!
But Meggy is Inkling
Way Miamoto is voicet by brook?
I just realized something meggy is an inkling sure she has become an anime form of a inkling but she's still an inkling if lawyer kong realized he could  do a IP Ownership Act since splatoon is nintendo's property but then would be almost impossible to save meggy or mario
If you think SMG4 will be in trouble, the answer is no. Simply put, SMG4 and Glitch Productions are in the Australia. Nintendo in there is NOT super strict as Nintendo of America. Also, Congratulations on 6 million, Luke and Kevin!
6mil Congrats What a funny video
Waitin on the ssenomdnar video in honor of 6 mil subs
I love  arson
IS NOBODY GONNA TALK ABOUT THE AMAZING THUMNAIL FOR THE VIDEO???
i hate meggys new voice
I always have wondered how Smg4 was able to make all this Nintendo stuff and still make a community and shows off it, without Nintendo doing anything about it
Nooooooo why
Kong: what i'm holding here is a dmca... Me: UNO reverse
Congratulations for passing 6 million subscribers, SMG4!!!
The battles of meggy and Mario is terminanted
YOOOO WE GOT HIM TO 6MILLION
Happy 6 millions of subscribers
Damn I wanted to see some meggy lawyer action in the court room
My worst fear is smg4 getting Sued and has to stop making videos
BALL BALL BALL
luigi gardening lookin fresh man
Sml and smg4 both got sued now
If  10:08 was a game I'd play it
Why was this so sad until the end
6 million subscribers and still counting…we always love your videos and keep making them in the future.   6666    M             M    IIIIIIIIIII   L 6           MM      MM         I        L 6666    M  M  M  M         I        L 6     6    M    M     M         I        L 6666    M             M    IIIIIIIIIII   LLLLLLL  SSSS   U      U    BBBB     SSSS S          U      U    B       B   S SSSS   U      U    BBBB     SSSS        S   U      U    B       B          S SSSS   UUUU     BBBB    SSSS  6                  M  I  L                S U B S
0:45 That knock sounds so realistic I thought it came from my door
I know there's no more lore arcs but this video almost made me think a new arc was starting
They just need a clone of mario for the games (logic)
I got worried that you were getting sued
Shoulda called saul
Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Luigi is not main
I’m new
The way Lawyer Kong gave Meggy the Cease and Desist paper gave me chills...
You know it's a gonna be a great day when smg4 uploades😄
Luigi is the Meg of this universe
My wotfi 2022 vibes are tingleing
That was really cool!
Who else thought that a major story beat would be in place here?
HELLO 👋
and as everyone would say "and nothing of value was lost"
meggys animation looks extremely smooth
Congratulations SMG4 make 6 millions!
congrats on 6 million subs
Mario use the starman invincibility power
:(
Is using someones elses property gonna Destroy all them? Expecially a Million Dollar Property, the Stealing only happens when it's Claimed, not just used.

Dont let that be a reality
I don't like when SMG4 gets band
oh I never realized you hit 6 Million Subscribers. Congrats
Ohhh mario and meggy friendship battle vesus Nintendo Nice animation and congrats 6 Million watch 👍👍
For a second there I actually thought SMG4 was actually getting sued. Thank goodness it was just another joke. Lmao
So good
Did SMG4 actually get a cease and desist note from nintendo?
Smg4 your videos are so good every one makes me laugh! 😂 also I love the kanye west voice 😂
This is one of the most coolest smg4 videos yet!
I dislike Smg4 as a whole and I do think one day, they will get cease and desist from Nintendo and I will be happy
Yo I’d play Super Luigi Gardening!
This felt like a movie
Happy 6 million subscriber anniversary
what if mario was mx was the fiight sence: the papers dont work at him.. and he will beat all himself... if you ask ''why papers dont work at him'' beceause he is not a nintendo character anymore , he is mx.. he has his own game... that means he is the ruler
Congrats on 6M and this video was epicly epic
Eh. Looks like Luigi doesn't mind.
next mario game: super luigi garden
Two whole ark chances
5:28 Animated so smooth
This Video Wasnt That Good... I Expected For A Special Thing To Happen. Not Really That Good.👎
Man why do the bad things always happen to Luigi what did he do!?
6:29 Another instance where Meggy's law degree comes in handy.
YEAH 6 MILLION
Congratulations on 6 million subs SMG4
This might be a start of a new arc... the NINTENDO arc!
2:34 Everytime I don’t put the Wiimote safety strap on.
on a scale of 1-10 how good of a lawyer is meggy if she was partnered up with the legendary Phoenix wright
6m smg4 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
When I read the title I actually thought he got sued
They really don't care about Luigi.
E
If you do get sued nintendo is very strict ive seen it with sml
We all know that this is leading to WOTFI? Right?
I’m early and pls pin meh
Amazing, as always :)
You didn’t get sued but smg4 did

I though he actually got sued bro i would cry all night long
Whoa congratulations on 6 million, Luke!🥳
Yeah, 6 Million!!! Way to go, SMG4!!!
Wow, This does feels like something nintendo would actually do
Me: (looking at Donkey Kong) hey how many relatives do you have?   Donkey Kong: yyyyeaaaahhhh
Anoder serie
I like seeing Mario & Meggy teaming up together again. And I think we can all agree that this episode was better than the last one. BTW, if SMG4 ever got sued in real life, that would suck. P.S. Congrats on reaching 6 Million subs! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
09:05
everything reflects off of other things so don't take smg4 for granted.
new video les goo
new arc
Please do "If Mario was in... Cartoon Network".
Request:Mario (Nintendo) vs Mario (smg4)
Que genial smg4444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444434443344444 ponbrecito luigi
This is a possible beginning of a story arc. Nintendo Arc perhaps?  edit: I called it. Only thing I got wrong was the name of the arc
Congrans you have got 6million subs
Hahahaha nice one episode
6:41 - That's the battle theme from Digimon World 2
Super Luigi gardening sounds like an amazing game
Monke be mad
MEGGY LAWYER POWERS ACTIVATE!!
The voice acting and the thumbnail makes this look like a new arc 👀
It wouldn't be good if they actually got sued by nintendo
SMG4's been sued multiple times and won, looks like he's finally met his match. Then again, Mario's blown up Nintendo before, so either Nintendo got stronger or Mario got dumber. Cool video!
yay 6 mil
Now this. This is a good video
Bro I hope this never actually happens, infact just in case you might want to put a disclaimer at the beginning of every video
Congrats for your 6M Suscribers
Oooooooh nnnnnnnooooooo
e
Congrats on 6 mil
Remember, if all else fails we will always have the internet archives
marios life is sometimes a nightmare
imagine if this was based on true events and this is how smg4 says goodbye
NOOO U CAN DO IT
You reached 6M subscribers! Well done! ^^
Lawyer Kong: "This isn't the last you've seen if me" Me: yep, he's gonna appear in a important arc
Isn’t in splattoon which meggy is in which splatton is own by Nintendo which they own meggy
Cool video and if Lawyer Kong comes back then we’ll be ready to give him a knuckle sandwich for being a jerk
Sfv guile's theme
6M? Wasn't your 5M celebration like 5 months ago? Massive well done btw, what about getting another 10M in a month someday? Btw I love Meta runner S3.
I wish SMG4 was more present in this series
YES 6 MILLION SUBSCRIBES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SMG4 i hope good day becouse you hit 6M on Youtube
The video
I would play super Luigi gardening
So many people already saw it
Someone went to law school
hello
Glad to be part of the 6 million, this channel is amazing
dam I guess nintendo didn't like Mario's smash or pass
Finally, a good upload
imagine thsi was real 💀
smg4 is cool, change my mind
2:09 Sus 🤨📷
Bro Mario was arrest
huh
This proof that mario is smart
I already know why you are being sued right when I tapped on this
Damn if smg4 ended up lkme sml i aould have been very very sad :/
Is this real?
Smg4 yeeeeehhhhhhhhh boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
why does no listen to luigi? NOBODY CARES! NOBODY CARES!
Quite surprised this didn’t happen earlier.
5 mill already congrats bruh
Congrats on 6 mill guys I’ve been watching u since around 1.3million subs and I’ve never laughed so much since I watched u
Congratulations on 6mil!
🤔
CONGRATS ON 6 MIL BRO
Cool and awesome👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
The only reason smg4 doesn't get sued is because he makes no money of these only stuff meta runner
YOU 6 Mn!
smg4 i like yore vids😀😀😀😭.
Ok
Your the best makes me laugh and smile
Congrats On 6M Subscribers!!! I've Been Here On Your Channel Since Mid 2012 Here To More Memes ^^
but CONGRATS ON 6M SUBCRIBERS
Good job on 6 mil I happ for u
pls say u did not get sued for real
I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet
6mil congratulations
This is going to become a arc I know it
idea: mario plays subnautica
did you actually get in trouble by Nintendo? like super mario logan?
lol alternate ending
Lets goooo you have 6 million now
Получается Мэгги не зря училась на адвоката
It's just the same thing when serious stuff happens oh it's almost going to lose and that's it and then boom anything stop and then go normal I just have a sick of it
Congrats on 6M:D. Hope that gift helped:D Also ur the best
Where have I seen this ending before…. Well, before he interrupted
Did you actually get sued?
Shouldn't Lawyer Kong have brought up the fact that Meggy originates from Splatoon?
OMG ITS ITS ITS HAHA LUGI GONE ARC
Mmmmmm
time to watch another smg4 video
Took nintendo long enough
Start of new arc? This could be potentially a bigger threat than zero
Where is meggy and that anime girl, i forgor her name 💀
Love the animation its so so so cooool, meggy looks badass with mario fighting. Amazing work!
Thanks For 6 000 000 Sub.
the knocking scared me so badly :C
That battle animation was so fluidddddd
Finally, no sponsor
Imagine smg4 actually gets sued
Sue
6 MIL YEAHHHHHH
If this is going to be an arc, I can imagine this going two ways.  Either Mario wins and is allowed to stay within the SMG-verse or this is the time Mario gets the Meggy/Melony/Saiko treatment and get plastic surgery.  Either way, I’m invested in what’s to come
This could have been more like a reason for splitting the Group for a new ark  I mean last Episode the Crew actively tried to get rid of mario so that would have been a good chance
Don't tell me this is gonna be an arc...
I love when smg4 does emotional scenes like this
hehehheehehhehe
Bro. I was litterally thinking about what if u get sued by Nintendo for using mario lol. Are u reading mah mind?
6 mil subs congrats🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳!!!!!!!
He is not the real Mario just saying.
According to how SMG4 universe work and how it’s characters progress and change over the years, I can assure you, that Luke and Kevin will find yet another way through the Arc of some sort that will make it all original and tied up only to that channel’s universe and the story that is taking place there.  In other words, Mario will become his original character, reincarnate into a vaguely resembling Mark’s Pizzeria mascot In low poly. (I really have NO idea about what’s that suppose to mean).
SPOILERS: Watch the full video before reading this comment if you want to avoid any spoilers of this video. If you're fine with spoilers, then you can keep reading (if you want)     I was wondering why Meggy sounded different than usual, like, she doesn't sound like Lizzie Freeman, now after seeing the credits, I'm just asking; did they replace Lizzie with Elsie Lovelock? I mean, it's fine, her voice does sound pretty good as Meggy, and Elsie is very talented, all I'm asking is why would they replace the original voice of Meggy with someone different?
I don’t think they’d sue the channel, they’ve acknowledged SMG4’s success when Luke and Kevin visited Nintendo NY
SMG4 you got Spam Bots flooding in your Comment sections Delete them if you wish or ignore
Congratulations smg4
At least luigi loves it
Luigi deserves a game where he can just chill without having to worry about ghosts popping out to kidnap his brother...though you just know Piranha plant is gonna be the final boss.
My hate to meggy grows even more
BRO smg4 did u commentbefore this and keeping it for urself dats how u did the 9days agos
Someday this might be Canon!!!!
Claim your “in an hour” ticket here.
I love that Miyamoto's voice is Brook's VA from One Piece
50 minutes pog
Befor watching this video I told myself: "If they're gonna tell me they fr got sued, I will cry."
i have a feeling this will be an arc about mario this time
I'm glad Nintendo didn't actually come for your channel
STOP IT THE VIDEO ENDS!!!
only $60 dollars
╏ ” ⊚ ͟ʖ ⊚ ” ╏ it is like 53 min that I am late but if it was 1hour I sure will be late
If Nintendo Strike his Channel everything is canon.
Clawroline:MEOW!! (stop showing us SMG4'S latest video on the search list, youtube!! I swear the current SMG4 era is truly horrible)
I think a new arc is starting
M E M E S
When hw said dmca now i will stop videos me is that including irl?
You actually had me worried with that pop up with Nintendo being Nintendo I really thought you were getting sued LOL 😂
Even on a smg4 video funky kong is a problem for me  Curse you funky on the Bowser bike
Super Luigi Gardening: + Excellent Design + Challenge Mode + Retro, Yet Fresh - Visuals, Audio - Too Much Water
This is gonna be the start of the sue arc or something.
I can’t believe Mario is (kinda) smart!
(4:23) Mommy: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa (*Tarzan Yell*)! Look at that orange haired girl swinging by!
I was about to think Mario or Nintendo ark begins-
And that's how Luigi's Mansion 4 was born.
Are you gonna make a part 2
first SMG4 gets sued for using mario next Weegeepie gets sued for using luigi ITS ALL COMING TOGETHER
I Knew smg4 wood make a video about being sued by Nintendo but that's not really going to happen right.and congratulations on biting 6 million subscribers on youtube can't believe you made it this far.
XD
At the start is a short from smg4
wait is this a new arc...?
This is America he can have a gun
o frick lawsuit arc
"No guns! This is a Nintendo game!!!" Splatoon: *bruh*
I wanna play that game
i love how theres more smooth animations!
August 21st is my grandpas birthday,which is tomorrow! Could you say happy birthday for him please? 🥹
Anyone else starting to realize there’s more quality and smoother animation in videos now? It’s starting to get insane how much the channels improved!
Gg on 6mil
I felt like you're content started to feel different, but this make me feel like it's always been you since the first video!  (Really glad you didn't change the outro song btw!)
E
It can't be over.....
Donkey Kong: its Donkin' Time
Lawyer Kong And Miyamoto Thinks That They Can Do This???  THIS IS WAR!!!!!!!!!!!  Pokemon Is Part Of Nintendo. Lucario Will Stop Them.   SMG4 IS NEVER GETTING SUED!!!!!
I'm getting very surprised that smg4's video is getting alot different and better somehow, just look at the animation that has been changing throughout the years....
Seu
Mario and Meggy working together is one of the best things I've seen.
The Nintendo arc?
Respect to those that haven’t been able to win from Nintendo sues, SML for example
More cuss words
🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋
That was funny but a bit weird. But I loved it.
Why did you vendor the cuss words
LMG5
0:24 pickmen
4:22 and 5:58 i LOVE the Phoenix Wright refrence it's one of my favorite games! (My number 1 is FNaF)
This was the perfect episode for Saul Goodman
3:45 As “someone” i know says *”fangame or not saving peach is the plot”*
is this real?
Super Luigi Gardening
Congratulations 6 mil
Well Luigi actually enjoys Nintendo which is why they're not as bothered at getting him back unlock mario who just enjoys sever agony
Plot twist: SMG4 is immune to Nintendo Sueing
Captions would make this so much better
Is this made up or is it true
This is too funny!!!!
I laugh so hard at marios expression sometimes 😂
THIS IS THE MOST FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER FREAKING SEEN
Pov : you forgot meggy canonly have a degree in law
@SMG4 i have watched all your episodes, well not on this acount but i hope you keep making funny videos please include rwby
6 millions!
4:45 local child bombs Nintendo
I need Luigi’s gardening game it looks sick
why no love the luigi...
Lol
NooOooO LUIGIIIIII
Wiping out or at least changing all the characters of the SMG4 universe that are related to Nintendo... It's something I'd imagine happening sooner or later due to said issues.  On a positive note: The animation looks gorgeous!
I have a feeling Mario not actually dumb, he pretend to be dumb
NOOOOO THE BUDGET IS GONE
For a second there I was assuming there will be a Nintendo arc.
nice vid but what 'bout luigi?
🗿
NICE
WOTFI 2022 IS ALMOST HERE!!!!!
It would be alot more depressing if smg4 is forced to stop making videos, we can't survive without him and his content.
lol have any of you noticed the metarunner reference at 8:45 to 9:20
Just like sml
Lawyer Kong Arc?
Good Job Hitting 6M Subs and Hopefully Ur Channel will be alright! And No Copyrights and Nintendo taking it off! Good Ending tho! It was funny
😥😥😥😥😥😥
I almost thought Mario would actually go,But I remembered something called main character power
I have a feeling that Monkey will be next villain and will be in next rap battle
Finally im no late
Where can I get that amazing cool game? "10:09"
OH GOD, I KNEW THIS DAY WILL COME
Are you gonna stop making videos
Happy 6 Million subs!
2:35 Wii pain
no more Luigi?
Ah, so begins the Nintendo Arc.
The judgement will force telling the Nintendo companies can do the right developed of each terms would be released any games is anonymously perfect idea.😂😂😂😂 Worth millions of dollar is for pay back by change the laws!🤑🤑🤑🤑💰💰💰💰
You hit 6m subscribers
6 mil nice
Hello sou eu brasileiro
Here before the video is one hour ago
If smg4 actually gets sued I will be so sad 😭
Lawyer Kong might be one of my top 3 favorite characters. How is he so cool
I hope Nintendo doesn't actually sue SMG4
𝓱𝓪𝓱𝓪
6 million reached on this meme channel lol!
This is the start of a new arc isn’t it?
xD
Meggy went full on yan fei mode at 6:08-6:32
😍😍😍
lol
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SMG4 HOT 6 MIL OH YEAH BABY
Looks like you better call Saul
can some explain to me where to get these SMG4 emoji’s
Here within an hour
B
6 mil subs!
Congratulations on 6 million.  You deserve it.
Yooooooooo
AYO 49 mins ago
Dang soon the God box come back to get his revenge from the smg's and avatar that's why he's going posses meggy in the future and mario had to phase his old friend after when melony goes to splatoon 3 place something for helping meggy
This is gonna have a huge level of irony if smg4 does get sued by nintendo
YESSSSSSSSIRRRRRRRRRR
I like gardening
Shut the duck up nintendo Kong dont stop making vids
This remains me of am2r and how Nintendo closed it
please
Congrats SMG4 For hitting 6 MIL keep up the good work
6MIL SUBS
wait really
I hope 🙏 that Nintendo saves itself for this disaster!
SUED
smg4 can mario be in like if mario was in splatoon 3
10:06 you guys don't care?!
😭😭😭😭😭😭 this is so sad that mario had to leave the mushroom kingdom
Next time on Evading Copyright..!
Seems like a cope ngl
oh  no =o i watching  now xD
Hi Sad
Make a 6 million special
I would want the next ark to be around Mario being to strong like speed runner Mario in terminal montages animation  I think that would be a good ark idea
the clown and lawyer kong should team up
10:05
Lol, I would actually love to see "Super Luigi Gardening" as an actual game
4:03 Joker in Smash: am i a joke to you?
Hell yeah! Digimon world 2 soundtrack!!
the part where smg4 said he'd have to stop making videos had me scared shitless.
It has to be said, Meggy is becoming more and more like an action hero, but one for this generation who's certainly kickass and way determined~! Now all she needs is some kind of visual power-up related to Fire, practically seems to be her element.  And hey looks like Lawyer Kong is another antagonist, that'll spice things up later down the line.
Insert black man crying
Meggy with the power of lawyer
Thanks again for proving that Nintendo is a fucking joke.
Congratulations On Getting 6M Subscribers I Love You Guys So Much
Nice going with the subs I was a fan from the start congrats on the 6 mil
SMG4  SONIC AS  MEGGY  DE F1 2022 RED BULL RACING
Happy 6 Million Subscribers! SMG4
No no it can't be true!?!?!
Brilliant work again, been waiting along time for a video like this. Now if only we could have a bowser series for his character arc (plz SMG4 PLZ)
Hi
Smg4 gets 6m subs
Why are the Nintendo goons just the Butt Ninja
Lawsuit moment
SMG4 is mario x meggy a thing
video 11 of me saying: 0:00 me when SMG4 uploads:
Man everybody is getting sued this month by Nintendo even Roblox has been sued by them this month!
I’m surprised Nintendo didn’t try to sue over this 😂
Wait was not bowser’s fury the lastest main mario game.
I follow this guy since 2m
6M!!!
Meggy and Mario's animation is getting a lot better  :o
46m early
DIDN'T NOTICE YOU JUST HIT 6 MILLION CONGRATS!
The animation is amazing
The power of papers
i watch this when it has 432 views i refresh the page after half hour and its 100,000 views
Oh no
* Mario, Meggy and the nintendo ninjas fighting, SMG4 crying bc he doesnt want to get sued * the rest of the SMG4 crew: yeah this is fine
r.i.p
7:12 Great opportunity to make fire Mario and an even more epic fight scene.  But of course, Mario gets no protagonism or role in the fights, just meme value
Wait no don't tell me it's getting sued just like sml I hope we don't get sued
congratulations you hit 6 milion
You're not really getting sued, are you? I would hate to see this channel shut down
Good as always
the start of the very illegal ARC
The animation has gotten much smoother over time. Nice work
*Haha! SUED 😭*
I love how Maggy tries to be a lawyer despite knowingly causing many acts of assault, murder and domestic terrorism
oh jeez i actually thought he was getting sued and couldn't use mario anyomore
EH
Man, a lot of amazing things happened in this video. Lawyer Kong taking Mario back and trying to takedown SMG4. Luigi's garden (yes, i wanna see it again). Meggy being a great friend as she mostly is to save Mario, and then Lawyer Kong comes back to the castle just to find Meggy becomes yet again a badass power girl and using her skills back from her law school. Wow, she's great (not a simp, 7yr minecraft veteran🙄). Finally, I thought Mario and the rest of the Nintendo characters were gonna be gone, until Miyamoto decided to make a game with Luigi with his gardening idea. I bet he's not staying there permanently like Mario was. Or I thought the Mario Bros go to Nintendo every once in a while. I actually need to look more into lawyering to understand this more. Because I think Nintendo doesn't want people taking too much advantage of Nintendo products. At least IMO, ok.
Fun fact those guard were the legendary characters from an old smg4 series,Butt ninja from guards and retards,hope smg4 returns this series i miss those
4:34 The RailRoad in F4
Congrats on 6million u deserve it <3
Hi
He'll be fine, right? *RIGHT* ?
2,699th
I never give up!
I fear no man *DMCA  But that thing, it scares me
Y'know things are gonna heat up when the rtx turns on and the animation turns to a clean 60 fps
This is already part of the arc I swear I’m feeling it.
Feel like this can be it own mini series.
Good job hitting 6m subs
I thought SMG4 can’t make videos with Nintendo stuff anymore, especially with Mario characters, just like how Nintendo sued SML, that really upset me. 😞
meta runner be like
6M SUBS!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hey Meggy,how do you feel about Splatoon 3?
Congratulations on reaching 6 million subscribers. 🎉 👍👍💥🎉👏🏾
Not gonna lie, was hoping for a Pikmin reference at the end.
7:57 ‘tactical nuke INCOMING’ had me on the floor dying 💀 Also congrats on 6million Subs! You deserve it man!
Congratulations on 6M subscribers 🥳🥳🥳
Good job on 6M
Good because Smg4 is bad nowadays
Haha
I liked it
7:49 I would like to say that I’m finally in an smg4 video
Sml: first time?
Good video!
As an SML fan, the title scared me.
Nice video, SMG4! The whole story is a masterpiece! Really appreciate this!      And the ending is freaking hilarious!
yeeee
I'm not sure if I noticed it before with his previous appearances but using Brook from One Piece voice for Miyamoto is genius
Congrat for 6m
I feel like the clown and the lawyer are going to team up and I feel like there's going to be more villains that once revenge on smg4 so I'm pretty sure we're going to see the next Italian war or with more villains instead of one
i want that game
And just like that, you know they had to make a terrible IGN rating on Super Luigi Gardening.
It's weird  how meggy should be still working in law school but idk maybe some fan know why bc im new
This man has been playing with fate for over 10 years, hasn't he?
i feel like SMG4 is always going for a fever dream type of video
POOOOR You!
So the law finally catched up with him
Will Lawyer Kong become the new SMG0?
I like how meggy freakin reanimates herself via partial law school
sue
I like the part where Meggy puts a lot of mushrooms in the suit guy😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
It like sml but smg4 tried to save mario
For a second there I thought this was the start of an arc
Hi
It funny if Nintendo made a luigi gardening game😂
You still need to stop making videos, because Nintendo will be vary mad at you,
Does anyone think this man will get sued by Nintendo
list of my fav things in this vid:  0:08 - same  0:26 - nom  0:37 - best hiding ever  0:51 - donkey kong ohh scary  0:55 - intense breathing  1:07 - suitcase.  1:14 - smiling :D  1:42 - "you know what this is?" paper.  2:10 - what is that? monster mario?  2:35 - nice shot  2:36 - :D  2:44 - WAH  3:03 - FALCON PUNCH!!!!  3:50 - YAHOOOOOOO  3:57 - gun.  4:23 - MONKE SWING  4:35 - "sry lol"  4:58 - imagine t-posing when being grabbed by someone  5:03 - hellooooo  5:17 - agreed with mario  6:37 - suitcase MK II  7:02 - true mad  7:05  - FIER!!!!!!!1!11!!!  7:20 - ITS A FURRY HELPPPP  7:47 - "who cares"  ok thats it i overtyped my fingers so the list is not complete  (took me like half hour)
6 Millionen subs 🎉🎉🎉❤
Well well well look who finally got copyright claimed
Poor SMG4.
Man! Cease and desisted by Nintendo will taking down some many view due Mario and other characters will change their look, and against the law. Just like SML, got the letter from Nintendo because, using plush toys last year from getting sued. If SMG4 got the cease and desisted letter from Nintendo their will be huge consequences, and have to change their characters could affect their video.  This is why you don't messed with Nintendo! Cease and Desisted Letter aren't good things.😐🙁😰😨
Wait doesn’t nintendo own meggy too🤨since they created her and all
💀
NO MORE LUIGI
Better Call Saul
Y'all should collaborate with SML
Sometimes people gets sue buy sometimes I know they didn't mean too just try to move on in your life
What made you think of hilarious channel bro I love it
Lawyer Arc
Smg4 has the best YouTube content
I wanna play Luigi's garden game
Me: thank God this isn't a cannon vid hehe ... Right?
2:35 pain.
SMG4: Welp i got sued  also SMG4: welp hopefully they didnt know i used a pirated copy of SUPER MARIO 64
De diez bro
I'm still thinking about the fact of Meggy not being a lawyer I mean look how cool she is with thelaw stuff
Nintendo arc
I ship mario and meggy
You always make me cry bro, you’re the fucking man. I love the person you are.
is no one gonna talk about these three thinks?  first: lawyer Kong, s bodyguards which was looked the same of the ( butt ninja ) from the guards n retards series  two : does anyone know that miyamoto didn't realize luigi,meggy,bob and fishy? luigi is  mario's brother so basically his a Nintendo character along with meggy,bob and fishy based of Nintendo characters and bob and fishy showed on Nintendo gets deleted in the Nintendo team and meggy based of inklings which is Nintendo characters aaaaand three: is no one gonna talk about the Heartbreaking scene that starts at 8:17? the part when meggy holds mario's hand for the last time for a sec then mario lefts her hand and lefts early and then smg4,mario and meggy looking sad was extra under Heartbreaking scene 8:84 edit: also i like meggy's ace attorney skills and smoth animation and the fighting between mario and meggy vs the bodyguards
The ninja lawyers can't throw joycons cuz they always drift
and the arc begins. if anyone important dies im gonna lose it.
The ultimate War smash is coming soon smg4 enjoy your lovely piece of the world real soon because there's going to be a war and ultimate War smash is coming real soon
AFTER I HEARD THAT DAMCA OR WHAT EVERY I SAVED EVERY VIDIEO OF SMG4  I AM NOW DELETING THE VIDS
I’m here within the hour, I claim my ticket
YOU ARE DED NOT BIG SURPRISE
and here i thought that a Nintendo member (Lawyer Kong, Miyamoto, ect.) would point out that Meggy used to work for them, but due to SMG4, that is no longer the case
Nice episode, but I still want Mario to leave the group because of the way they treated him last week
Im tellin yall, these videos keep gettin better and better! Keep up with the goid work SMG4!!
When I was watching this it was only made for 31 minutes
2 600
God save smg4
Nice animation for Meggy
wow
116,853 person here!! lets goo
Video idea: If Mario was in…. Warner Bros.
Nintendo Arc
Congrats on 6 million 🎊🎉🎊🎉
and you call this an episode?? i'm sorry but this was pretty cringe.... i hope you have a real special one saved.
i kinda want this to be an arc in someway  they did say he will be back butthen again its just funny jokes
Memes. More MEMES!!1!1!
Can We Hit 10k likes on this comment?
In case if that's happens what character will replace Mario
6mil nice!!!🎉
no se que decir pero estuvo entretenido video super mario bros es una mis sagas favoritas
I mean lawyers
YE JUST HIT 6 MILLION WHERES THE 6M SUB SPECIAL  Nintendo stopped SML  Now their gonna stop SMG4  SMG4 and Meggy are Dumb Marios Bestfriends
Eh no one really cares about Lugi
can we get a video about wario gets shot down from the waluigi-copter at 9:35 PM
If that actually happened, SMG4 might need to redesign the characters. Just like SML
Queeee
I thought this was gonna be a Mario ark that fight scene was lit tho another thing two of my videos got age restricted for no reason so be careful SMG4 there going for everyone
Congrats for 6 million subs smg4
Yea, stop making videos!!
congrats on 6mil big guy
I really liked that video. The concept is interesting, it's well animated and there's funny jokes and callbacks. The ending was funny too. And I'm just happy this video doesn't exist because Nintendo actually told them to cease and desist.  The video could have had a sad ending and after that there would be Luke and Kevin saying that SMG4 is over. But I guess that if this would have been the case, they would have called the video "The end of SMG4" or something like that.
this video could acctually get smg4 sued because of how it frames Nintendo is the kinda ironic thing
at least Luigi enjoys it 😉
Congrats to 6 million subs Smg4 we all really appreciate your work keep it going 🤩. Now onto the Video!!!👍
Mario Ain't Getting Roasted This Week...
Congrats on 6 million subscribers SMG4! But i have one thing to say..  WHEN NEW MARIO GAME! OOG BOOG HOH HOH HOH.
GigaSMG4
Well, Mario was in trouble first, I meant  now, only to get his hands off  Nintendo,  and yes
You know what time it is 6 MILLION SPECIAL
Adios luigios
*Eh*
There is is again, Mario showing some heart out of the blue.  I’m starting to sense a Mario Arc, probably something to do with Meggy since he seems to have his best relationship with Meggy.
Congrats on 6M SMG4!
Early gang
I love your vids
good.
Wow 38 minutes after uploading and there's already 2.5k comments
Well this situation was bound to happen sooner or later.
Hope he doesn’t end up like the channel SML
He bck
Mxm moment at 9:06
Meggy the only “Princess that saves the hero Mario.
Bots be like:Smg4 never fails to entertain us  Smg4: IM BEING SUED YOU BOT
I think this video was in reference to something that happened IRL.
9:04 feels like MR1 season finale
You know I personally don't think SMG4 would be making an episode like this if he was actually getting sued by Nintendo. Don't you think he would've already addressed that kind of a situation in a seperate video?  CONGRATS FOR 6 MILLION SUBS MAN! SMG4 ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE
It was funny and not real you sill got it ha ha
Based on a true story I presume
Might not matter to much but nice to see a small call back to Meggy being trained in how to be a lawyer from the school/ college episode way back when (when she returned for her law degree and proved Mario innocent of stealing from the cafeteria.)
Oh no
Looks like smg4 1 Nintendo 0 but if that gorilla keeps taking away smg4 loves again so help meggy she will call all her friends to help her rip that gorilla piece by piece
Super Luigi Gardening? Shut up and Take my Goddamn money this instant!!
😸👏
Meggy’s animation was absolutely superb! Great job SMG4!
3:56 I hear that persona 5 music
Lawyer Kong: *Brings out Cease and Desist* Me: fair use, bring out fair use!
HI SMG4
Arc arc arc
i am confused how the clown virus just... stopped existing? like, everyone except mario was a clown, and it got resolved the next episode and it is never mentioned again?
“What about Luigi?”  Eh, he doesn’t have plot armor.
Think about smg4 getting sued that would be horrible no more fun
Are you really getting sued?
Guys I think it’s another Story
If Nintendo wanted to pressing charges against this channel, why now? My guess is that Nintendo doesn't take too serious. Especially, Nintendo did receive lawsuit from Universal Studio back then. Allegations about copyright can be very poppycock.
Mom?
*finally reaches 6 million subs* *gets sued the very next day*
What About Luigi? ... Eh... (I Cried! XD)
:)
i’m glad tuv is getting big :3
YO IM SO EARLY
Amroi
What about Luigi "eh"
lol
Damn this is good editing ngl
I thought this kong ha had a broken ass.
When wotfi 2022
Luigi is happy. he can garden now without the pressure of keeping it away from Mario.
how could meggy save mario didn't nintendo make splatoon
Congratulations
Smg4 videos have interesting plots, but this one was more interesting and captivating than usual. The battle in the middle was outstanding and epic. I loved that this video had more Meggy and Mario friendship bonding in it and I liked the detail and comedy put into it. Considering 'Lawyer guy' said they hadn't seen the last of him, I think it'll turn into an arc (I'm thinking it would be called the Nintendo arc). Anyways, congratulations on getting 6 million subscribers, Smg4! I knew you could do it.
Luigi: *this is fine*
Hmmm
If this happens we shall riot and fight for fair use, especially when nintendo steals a lot of fans ideas for and claim it’s their own project and profit heavily off of it
6M
Nice and awesome and Mario and Meggy teamwork are amazing and congratulations Smg4 and keep up to good work
Cool
This sure was a crazy video to watch and I enjoy it and Mario is saved again
Congratulations for getting 6 million subscribers SMG4
did you actually get sued?
Smg4: hello it's My friends, Marko and loui
Shouldn’t meggy be also taken since she is a Nintendo character
This accurate if Smg4 gets sued which he will be he will be a fallen channel like Sml he will be forgotten
BOII
THE BUT NINJA RETURNS!111!!!1
Congratulations 6 milion subscribers
Ah yes finally lugi in the spot light great video smg4 cant want for more lawyer kong arc 🤡🤣💙(btw meggy's animation looks sweet 😎
me: *calls the NINTENDO POLICE* ladies and gentlemen we got em :)
You have never done something stranger things theme yet and you finally got 6m subscribers(:
i can never see a tear of joy now only tears of sadness
It would be amazing , to see a longer version
I would hate for people to compare this video to the situation that happened with SML. SMG4 and SML are NOT the same thing! Also hey, congrats on 6M subs lad!
Sans:so when is the roast video
10:04 Luigi was my favorite character
Now that I think of it how have they not been sued
Why do I feel like this gonna happen
Nice animation
Happy 6 milion sup's
I kinda want see Mario in the latest games to be fair. Could be a nice change besides the main story plot stuff. And yes i know there's the mario react videos. But i  miss bowser and the others on a adventure with him.
I hate the Knocking Sound effect SOOO MUCH
smg4Cool
is funny that im also from mario
did I arrive early ?
I will forever love you guys smg4!!!
This is history
mario
Is Lawyer Kong’s voice the voice of the DK Rap singer in DK 64?
Let’s hope this channel never gets a cease and desist letter or I will cease to exist.
F Luigi Nintendo can keep him
3/10, does not contain being sued
CONGRATS ON 6 MILL 💖💖💖🥂
kek
I only started watching his channel a couple weeks ago and I already love it I'm planning to binge watch at the entire time at school
I feel like this happened with smg4 irl
Is this the start of the Nintendo Ark?
I hope you Don’t actually get sued
5:22  Found the perfect meme scream  👍👍
The 6 mill milestone!
Should have fought back with spaghetti.
L
You are a genius, this video is so cool and so funny🤣,good work👌
CONGRATS SMG4 ON HEATING THE 6 MILLION SUBS 🤟 AND NEXT VID SPECIAL 6M SUBS WOOHOO!
Today when i woke up, i had a feeling: man, smg4's subs are growing up fast!
i HOPE ITS WOTFI
kinda iffy on Miyamoto just being represented by random Japanese voice clips :/
I love your videos
1:36 it’s the mama****a line but without the beep
Nice vid
the gave miamoto brook's voice
This should be a mario game
Why every time. Meggy just ruins every episode shes in
SML
will this be a new arc
This animation was sick bro And the epic fight seen with the Nintendo ninja's and Mario and Meggy was sick Btw congrats on 6Million subs 😁👍🎉🎊
Wow.
Yes finally Nintendo did it
it was from throwing the party while peach was gone, peach got assaulted and sued smg4
0:06 what version of that song is that? Ik its dr.mario but like what version?......did smg4 make it?
Thank god this won't happen to the channel.
God, I love Meggy!
9:53 Wait a minute... Isnt mean the next Villain of SMG4 Lore will be a Lawyer Kong?!
6M subscribers, truly amazing! Now we’re are just so close to 6.9M subscribers
OH NO THEY TOOK LUIGI
If there is any game developer here please create super Luigi gardening
Very interesting based on a very relevant subject.👌
omg thats so epic!1!! but mario should do a video trying to play among us
Noice , no get sue
You ending YOUTUBE NOOOOOO
You just need to know the name of the channel before you like the video.
Amo tus videos :3
Press it
Eh.... 10:05  BTW congrats on 6 million 👏
Why am I sensing a new arc? 🤔
I thought the sml thing was going to happen to them of thank god
Looks like SMG4 really saw franzj's videos
8:05  Meeh.. Meeeeeh-.   O҈O҈F҈
I knew this would happen , sml got it and now…
So nobody is talking about the Ace Attorney references? Okay.
Man i completely forgot Meggy was a lawyer
Mario gets to stay, Luigi gets to enjoy the spotlight, a win for everyone😁
Mario and meggy make a great team
Let's hope smg4 doesn't end up like sml
Wait so your ending?
Really strange politics nintendo 🤨☹
I see another mario x meggy moment I hope it happens
imagine super luigi gardening becoming a thing lol (and yes made by nintendo)
Nintendo is scary
Goes to show that Nintendo is basically an evil company in every universe not just SMG4's.
Everyone is now scared and frightened because they saw a dangerous monster the only one to defeat the monster is Luigi by the power of love but they fight Nintendo right when they wanted to sue SMG4 PlayStation comes in puts Nintendo right where it belongs and and then they sue Nintendo then they make Luigi and SMG4 free!
you think your safe from nintendo....I believe the original Nintendo in Japan is more strict than the one we have here in the states.
I really like on how Meggy is being animated very smoothly throughout some parts in videos really good keep it up SMG4 !!!!
It’s been 5 years since Mario Oddesy came out?!   Man I feel old
Congrats on 6 mil smg4 i've watched u when i was a little kid hope to see hit this milestone!
I love the bonding moments for Mario and Meggy
Maravilloso
Hopefully there isn’t any paparazzi when you hit 10 million(and I will kill anyone who doesn’t subscribe)
OMG IM LATE
Wait I have only a question for smg4 did you actually get sued from Nintendo when you're making your videos for years for using their characters without their permission or something like that because it really got me off balance that you got yourself sued from Nintendo themselves
Contracts on 6 Mill smg4                Get stinkid
Dude, this is ur best work in awhile, nice, keep up the good work.😁😎😎😎😎
I would kick those police ase for you if you get sued
Becareful because Nintendo can be a little piece of sh-
I really enjoyed this!
love the wii nunchucks
Mario
Nice video 🤙
This happened to sml and its gonna happen some day to smg4 and this is gonna age like old milk
ip ownership and dmca should be struck out of law
6 MILLION YES WE MADE IT!!!
The OG of OGs
Did we just enter "The Copyright Arc"?
It's so NICE 🤩
What can I just use one of the many Mario clones that are in the basement I've said too much haven't I
Mantendo Ninjas
Yay
Truly epic work from the man and legend himself, known as SMG4.
No broblem
*Substory Complete: The Fair Use Fight* I’ve got a feeling King Kong over here is gonna keep his word.    (What am I doing with my life writing this comment?)
SMG, u start a play in Ace Attorney? Just so many references. I love ur videos and these references *making me so happy*
Pog
I swear, SMG4's animations are getting more smooth and amazing each video!
Please tell me this was based off a true story.
imagine nintendo watching this video....
Congrats on 6 Million subs!!!
Miyamoto: Yohoho  Me:  * laughs in One Piece references *  EDIT: CONGRATS ON 6M SUBS!!!
LEZZZZZZ GOOOOOOOO! 6M SUBS!
Don't Mute  and I hope it's not that bad.
ninetendo can defeat mario en meg ez cause they can ban them
Damm I did not know meggy went to law school
I hate to say it, but I feel like we are getting hints of Mario and Meggy one day could get into a relationship or is it just me?
First of all! 6 MILLION! LETS F*CKING GOOOOOO-(cough cough) anyways, I honestly thought this was gonna be the start of a new arc where Mario leaves and the smg4 family has to live without Memes and all Mario characters and locations.
And another arc begins I think
I haven’t watched this channel in a long while so now I need to watch like 2-3 years worth of Lore and videos.
She follow dr Fran 🤯😎
Uh oh just like SML of Course since Nintendo sued him they are now Suing SMG4 wow that’s just not good and great job reaching 6 million subscribers SMG4
I don't really fully understand, people say that Nintendo got SMG4, but idk if it's true. Can someone explain it to me?
The next wotfi
Rip Luigi
Congrats on 6m subs 🥰🥰🎂🎂
i was watching Gaurds 'N Retards before this, when u making more of it?

What's up? Problem with copyright law?
Congrats on reaching 6 million subs! Anyways, who wants to make a real Super Luigi Gardening game?
Amazing how they took that what if video and turned one of the universes into a reality
This video made mr remember how Logan from sml got swed by Nintendo 💀💀💀
Hi !
It's awesome that meggy still remembers that she used to be a lawyer
I'm glad you're not going to get sued SMG4
Meggie is technically a lawyer isn't she?
Be happy that there is no Contract for school, oh wait a minut-
Wait Sakurai is voiced by brook
First SML now SMG4
*SIX MILLION CHADS. HELL YEAHS 10 YEARS OF SUCCESS*    congratulations on 6 million! You've accomplish so much and you've deserve it bro. Thanks so much for making my childhood
Happy 6 million subscribers smg4
Wait is the Miamoto voice Brooke from One piece?????
From 7:01 to 7:13 Mario gets his mostach back

Oh no! (Congrats on 6mill btw)
adios
Claim your "here before half a hour (30 minutes)* ticket here! And how you can claim it is if you reply to this while this is made while it isn't 30 minutes or more! Understand?
Soo cool!
arc?
I love the paper mario music!
i have a feeling an arc is coming
I think I remember smg4 was actually endorsed by Nintendo once. A long time ago on his channel, one of the Nintendo staff said they enjoyed his videos?
smooth animation
So are we not gonna talk about that Mario is a furry when he does the Leaf he has cat ears
I really hope you guys don't get Sued by Nintendo you guys are hilarious
Only a true master with 6 mil subs could make excellent choreography with lawyers. Excellent work!
Congratulations on 6 million subscribers SMG4! You never fail to make us laugh.
first
I would buy Luigi gardening
Meggy is actually secretly Saul Goodman
9:30 Oh! LUFFY(?) SAAAAAN!!! 9:35 YOHOHOHOHOHOOOOOOO!!!!!
Remember, Lawyer kong said " this isn't the last you seen of me" so he may come back for revenge. Let's hope that the Smg4 gang is ready for him this time
10/10 pal
rip Luigi I guess
Yes
Could this be the Nintendo arc it could be
You’re at 6 mill? And you made this? Nice
Do a video where mario goes to contries
elo
It would've been funny if they called Disney as a last resort to get Mario back
Ohhh I get it The ninjas are law SUITS
I'm pretty sure this gonna be an ark Wait, didn't we already do this.
Mario is canonically a war criminal
*Good Ending* Luigi gets the things he deserved all along  :))))
I just came here to congratulate smg4 for 6 million subscribers, it has been a great experience on this channel and much more....
Wow so smg4 how about if Mario was in call of duty
If it gets taken down, it's cannon
I’m still wondering if this is still part of a larger storyline. Also the way the characters act towards Mario and how Mario acts seems to change from episode to episode. I’m thinking we’re getting a Mario arc here lol
Happy 6 million subs
when nintendo
i always wondered why they havent been hit with a dmca but glad they havent!
I’d play that game.
The Japanese wii manual:don't fight with wii nunchucks
this is the first video ive ever watched from him and im dying what the heck is happening?
007 Gun Mario 😆😆😆😆
Start of a new arc?
Did you know that Mario is 5 feet tall
The return of lawyer Meggy
"Mario is a free person" Me: *buys it for free*
This video is essentially one big long custody battle between SMG4 and Nintendo
For a sec I thought Nintento actually told you to stop using mario
Red tape, more devastating than any physical weapon.
Ë
6m?
Am I the only one here questioning how smg4 said a comment 9 days ago when this was made 26 mins ago-          Also happy 6m and here under an hour
SMG4 vids have gotten much more cinematic haven’t they 6:46
Di a 6 million special
NOOO HE ATE DA PICKMIN!
‏مبروك عليك 6,001,000 مشترك
But there's Luigi Games ima try it out
Now That's Something
Heh, the company doesn’t know Mario is still stupid with full of memes inside of him.
27 minutes and 2k comments,this man is legendary
Congrats on the Milestone and Yes I saw the video
WAHOO
Good riddance
Wow it's been a year since you hit5 m and now we got 6m
Do more lore.
I’d buy Luigi’s gardening game
27 mins from release
Luigi: guess i'll die
Smg4 congratulations on 6 million subs
Sml has already been sued by Nintendo
its the first time i see mario smart
Buff Luigi needed his return
bro i forgot Meggy was canonically a law student
eh meggy is safe why? because Nintendo owns Splatoon not ocs
shoutout please i love your channel its so funny'
Dude, if I were there, I would literally just summon a demon and obliterate lawyer kong to the high heavens.
Recent episodes have involved "shows."
i had a dream where nintendo sent smg4 a cease and desist letter..... it came true.     congrats on 6 mil btw
Amazing one keep at it I looking forward to the next one Also I starting to think that mario and meggy might be a couple in the future
7:42🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
here already wow
9:35, YOHOHOHOHOHO
Oh man...
Congrats on 6 mil I have been watching you for 4 years : )
Screw Nintendo also congrats on 6 mil
Very scary angy monke also what the hell are they going to do with Luigi other then making a gardening game with him
this is meant to be funny not sad
Meggy is not a ripoof splatonn model?
Oh nooo
Congrats On 6M 🥳🥳👏👍!!!
This is getting interesting
Before 1 you’re ticket
SMG4, OMG4, OMG this is so good
I smell an arc.
I love how they didnt care bout Luigi at first
Congrats on 6m! I feel like SMG4 is making more enemies for later use, like another Arc. But it could just be SMG4 messing around with some random character plots. But since The Clown from a few videos back seems a bit like a lasting villain, so I would be guessing the villains from these 2 videos teaming up to beat up Mario and SMG4. But since at the end SMG4 said it was just lazy acting, so I get it if it’s just irrelevant anymore. Also, Subscribe to Them!
Smg4: *scared of Nintendo* Also Smg4: *works with friends to kill literal demons and gods without hesitation*
Alternate Ending:  Meggy: Cease and desist? Under what actions? Lawyer King: Because of your Splatoon references. Meggy: Shit.  The End.   Not a mary sue anymore.
E e is god
If I had a nickel for every time a member from minus world uploaded a video about Nintendo ninjas today, i’d have 2 nickels, which is not a lot, but it’s weird it happened twice, right?
I love how the lawyer only cares about Mario and not Luigi despite him being a Nintendo character too, Mario did foreshadow Luigi i guess.
Did I just-
Cool video
Dimucc and his breath
You should've used an uno reverse card       WAIT A SEC I SEE SOME Meggy X Mario ACTION
Epic
What does this actually happened tho
Chair
5:23 “mom”
HAPPY 6 MILLION
Miamoto is using Brooke’s voice from one piece
IP contract delenda est.
I never thought I saw Meggy save Mario's life by trying to be seized by Nintendo itself and everything was almost going to be in chaos but in the end they had the need to have Luigi more in action, congratulations for your 6 millions subscribers 👏🏻, now the reach for the 10 millions to go 💪🏻
You better called Saul.
Uh Oh guess there no memes
Mario Pony
I’m early
This should of been the beginning of an Arc where Mario stops being stupid and fights SMG4, Alot of potential wasted!
SMG4 you're the best
Who Here Believes that The Old SMG4 was Better
Mom?! - Mario -
You just got 6m
1st
Luigi: I'm Famous 😱
6:29 well from the college video, how long where you in that college?
They better call Saul next time, he would’ve helped them.
I’ve always wondered why SMG4 hasn’t been sued by Nintendo yet 😂
Damn, I got excited for nothing, I was hoping that this was the start of a new SMG4 Arc
Amazing work! keep it up SMG4!
Luigi seems happy
Hey wait…is it just me or has Meggy stopped calling Mario “Red” now? I feel like I missed when that change happened.  Oh, and congrats on 6M subs too!
Nice job on 6 million
Oh Yeah!
so lawyer Kong is the next bad guy? okey dokey i can live with that as the balance of the smg4 unviverse kinda has run out of major bad guys  as well most have died or given up their evil ways also kinda surprised we haven't seen a therapy thing for smg4  i mean have you seen what all the smg4 characters get up to on a daily bases
Can we just admire how mario can be dumb 99% of the time and when there's something on the line, mario thinks strategic about his actions. He's evolving. It's also funny how Nintendo goes for sml for having mario characters in his videos and yet smg4 has mario in his videos and Nintendo doesn't go after him, pretty funny actually.  Congratulations on 6 million subs dude and thank you for being apart of my childhood.
It was only a matter of time
Animations are getting way better every episode keep it up SMG4!
Smg4
A Mario-themed farming simulator sounds pretty good.  Edit:  Somehow SMG4 predicted the direct having a bunch of farming sims, and none of them are Mario-themed
9:13 giving me flashbacks to Metarunner season one finale.
Am Finally Early :> Well 25 Minutes Late Lol– Also Congratulations On 6M!! <33 I've Been Watchin Ur Channel Since 3.4M Subs!! :D
Didn't this actually happen to SMG4? Edit: Now that I renember he and Kevin were just threatened (I think)
lmao imagine getting sued
Did SMG4 really get sued?
Finally A good ending for Luigi!😀
Nintendo arc???????
that'sa so nice
6 mil pog
Can you tell me wotfi 2022 will be themed
Babe wake up SMG4 uploaded a new video
:D
Nintendo strikes again!
This is the 2nd time I thought SMG4 was gonna start another arc
9:02  Where real men cried
L
Hope this is a new arc
Dang
This feels like the last episode of meta Runner season 1
2:35 Why always on smg4 vids the balanced damage must be this?🤔
Haha yes Japanese do Panay suing pppl go brr
Well good thing we got meggy and smg 4 voices for real this time in the video! DMCA meaning SMG4 videos to cease to exist for real! And I don’t know about Luigi. we should join forces with Susie the youtuber queen about the DMCA THINGY And smg1&2 about the DMCA and smg3 and smg0 about the existence of DMCA thingy that has been going on lately! I want to see an SMG0 focus episode about the existence of the good smg0 the nicer one before the bad darkness is inside of the existence
Congratulations on 6m subs smg4 I have an idea for an episode if mario was In god of war Or if mario was in Candy crush
honestly im suprised nintendo hasn't done anything yet, considering their rep with taking down fan games.
Not gonna lie I was worried.
Amaizing!👏🏻
SMG4: This video… Me: May SML Rest In Peace.
Dem can't wait for the Super luigi adventures 72 + extra sussy edition
Sheesh
LK LAWYER KONG
Ah hell yea, love the animation lol. Smooth
I would play Super Luigi Gardening
6M is noice
okay, no surprise, mario can get removed from the plot due to contracts with his parent company in-universe but wasn't because they wouldn't bother with him in-universe for the typical skewed priority reason      doesn't explain the contrived part of meggy somehow not counting, however, because as you should know best, *HER ORIGINS ARE STILL BASED ON SPLATOON ITSELF BECAUSE SHE WAS INITIALLY A LEGITIMATE INKLING FOR CRYING OUT LOUD*
Oh no sued NOOOOOOOOOOO
SUB TO SMG4
Bros got plot armor
Nintendo arc maybe
Claim the next within a hour ticket here other is full
Before an hour  23 minutes late
Dang, if this were true multiple would be down, but on a good side, Happy 6mil! SMG4 this channel is the best
Bro that episode hit it so hard like Mario gets sued I need a battery go open dang
Don't SMG4 videos fall under the fair use law of a parody?
Those vids get better each and every time in everything: animations storylines text color sometimes
Why do I hear more boss music? Like all of these isolated incidents may intersect?
epic
its a me smg4
I've been waiting since Psycho Mario for this moment.  Gold.  *GOLD.*
6:08 I mean meggy design is not splatoon anymore so technically meggy is not a nintendo character
lol I'm early
Oh man we are getting more different villains set up. And the clown from earlier….Ace Attorney I’m noticing more 😮
Smg4 you should make a Mario plays changed video
Six Mil. Everyone
nice 👍🙂👌
Among us
5 years...       Dk country meanwhile........
I'm so worried right now, you gonna stop making video out of Mario
Funny that Nintendo concerns to get Mario back but they don't care about them using guns
Hi
You love to see some smg4
YAY!!!! NEW VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations for 6 million but also I can't wait for the most darkest arc yet to come. But at the same time if smg4 doesn't want to get sued I say just redesigned Mario for the smg4 channel and make Mario What If for the outher that way he get sue for one it won't affect the outher.
E
Claim ya 15 minute card here I guess 🗿👍
When 6 million special?
WORST, 6 MILLION SPECIAL, EVER
So Mario is gone man stop the cap
You’re not alone. It happened to SML too!!
Nice
Congrats on  6 mill subs smg4
Noice vids
Is this true?
I can't be the only one who thought Mario was going to get a new original character design right? Though a video around ten minutes doesn't feel like the kind of video to have such a massive main character redesign. Hmm maybe in a arc that will happen who knows.
Man I actually really like this episode coz Meggy is actually a fighter again
Nice Job On 6 Mil :D
Three days until mario steals your liver!
did you actually get sued? my friend says that your being sued by nintendo for using mario in your vids. copyright strike.
i thought the knocking noise was my door lmao
we haven’t seen videos mainly bout smg4 lately
Super Luigi gardening
Firstly, congrats on 6 million subscribers you guys! And secondly, that title gave me a heart attack, and thought SMG4 content are going to be gone for good😓
I can’t believe Mario said it’s marin’ time and marined all over everybody
Mario should use more power ups
I love the absurd in your videos SMG4 😂.
I love You Smg4 😩🙏
This looks like something Nintendo would do.
i don't understand why Meggy acting Dio or anti zombie (bit of theory)
Someone else thinks its time for SMG4 to turn into an actual original OC and not another Mario recolor?
Happy 6 mil! I remember discovering you in 2014, and this has been my favorite channel ever since.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MARIO 😢😢😢😢😭😢😭😢😢..? Wait what we arrest luigi😐
beeg mario = beeg lawsuits
First Super Mario Logan now this
Based on a true story.
Meggy being the badass that she is as always. Also I think it's cool they referenced brought up the fact that she knows how to be a lawyer. Also the voice actress is doing an amazing job bringing this character to life.
tbh smg4 fell off after meggy was introduced
So no more Mario games
I dont think smg4 even realises that he hit 6Mil
oh shit
I hope nintendo doesn't sue smg4 in real life  because smg4 was my childhood fr.
I was expecting the ending to be Meggy pointing out that SMG4 Mario is more of a PARODY of Nintendo Mario and therefore falls under the terms of fair use in parody. Or Miyamoto could just get distracted by Luigi gardening. That works too.
Mario and meggy so epic! Bruh
SMG4 gets into some beeg legal trouble... hopefully not irl
Congratulation for the 6million! I was always a fan from the start!
Hello
i would play luigi gardening even though AC exists
Happy  6 mil subs
Super Luigi Gardening:  Casual/relaxing games about Luigi Gardening a flower, nothing will ruin his garden, right?
congrats on 6 mill subs . funny thing is that in the video nintendo doesnt care about luigi and toad to take them too.
Looks like Miyamoto saved the day.
Nooo
HE GOT ROSTATED
I swear this is the start of an ark and you can’t convince me otherwise
If it really got sued I will cry
02:46 Poor wegiepeegie
Me: Finally. Luigi gets his own game after a long while.
The animation in this one was amazing,  also, Congratulations for 6 Million Subscribers 😎⚡
Ngl, Luigi gardening could be a cool game with boss fights
E
lol
Hello early people
You made this in 2 in the morning
Meme in next vido
Ok, I have to know. Did you get TheInvertedShadow to help with some animations? I can recognize that quality anywhere.
They took Mario but not the iconic m off ur hat
ss
NOOOOO WHY NINTENDO THIS WAS PART OF MY CHILDHOOD
Take the baised pill😊
I was here before notif
I just noticed that he hit 6m
why do I smell the beginning of an arc here?
Best video 2022 2:45
Here within 20 mins
ohhhhh
And remember: if Nintendo strikes it, it's canon
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooooooooo
Finally, Luigi gets a major good ending. Justice for Luigi!
If SMG4 got sued bob,meggy,mario,luigi,and boopkins won't be here because they are based of nintendo characters
Cool
I feel like nintendo isn't actually going to do anything since smg4 is making Nintendo characters so popular keeping them relevant outside of their respective game, I mean look at meggy or woomy/inkling she was a massive hit and still is(remains to be one of my favorite characters other being meloney and karen) I can guarantee at least one person went and bought something splatoon related after the splatoon saga(smg4)
Smg4 is not sued for Mario
Why is there always demand here?
Mario in: Kirby and the forgotten land.
6 million video and it might go on arcs
e
The title: SMG4 gets sued                       Me:*clicks on the video*                       The intro: Thatsa so nice                        Me: I dont think thats so nice
You guys definitely had us in the first half, not gonna lie
I would like to simply say... Congratulations on 6M subs!
I hope nintendo doesnt Sue SMG4
💀🤣🤣🤣
Nintendo might have created Mario  But that right there is M@er!0 right there!
Hi
Sheesh TOOK em long enough to catch on.  We all knew this day would come. When the big man himself finally comes knocking to take his sons home.  And word of warning to ya Meggy: Yoir appearance may have changed but YOUR your history. YOUR a Nintendo property too~ Meaning they can just as easily seize you and mario, Luigi, and EVERYONE in the Mushroom Kingdom.  Nintendo: "When we want domething, we GET it. One way or another"
Better Call Saul reference
Nintendo can't file a DMCA because their games from the 1985 through 2005 have inappropriate jokes, alcoholism involved, murder, offensive jokes, smoking, nudity, usage of real guns, etc.
Super Luigi Gardening When? I´ll Beat this game in 100% soon!!!!  Lol
CONGRATS ON 6 MILLION
Man IGN was right, it really does have a little something for everyone

Well that was intense I thought this meant some sort of new arc to make Nintendo characters free to use...also nice animations man
Oh no
2:33 - RIGHT IN THE *PINGAS!!!*
This had me chuckling a lot! Great vid! I'm glad that our Nintendo of Australia does not have strict lawyers so you can keep on making vids for years to come!   Also will we be getting SSENMODNAR 6 million?
06:40 OMG! Digimon World 2 Battle Music! I'm getting old.

was expecting a new arc lmao
6 MILLION SUBS :D And what do we do to celebrate? Insult Nintendo of course! :)
frist video: you got mail!
Man. The sad thing is; this will all happen one day most likely
This video was action packed and amazing, also congrats of hitting 6 million subs and a channel like that who is trying his best not to get into any trouble with Nintendo will never get sued and also he uses Gmod so nothings wrong with that and uses Nintendo characters safely and also this channel makes me laugh the most. Good thing SMG4 won’t end up being like that other YouTuber who got sued by Nintendo. (Yep you know who I am talking about… a channel name SML).
Nice sgm4 nice 👍😎😎😎
Eu sou o único br aqui?
6m subs gg smgod4
depresso and lawyer kong try to destroy the smg4 crew

Meggy claims guns aren't Nintendo items. Hasn't she heard of Golden Eye 007?

based off a true story!
Not what I expected... But it's still hilarious.
Congrats on 6 million subs! If anyone says that Endgame has the most epic battle then prove them wrong by showing the fight sequence between Mario and Meggy vs. Lawyer Kong's security guards.
Cease and unexist
Hi
Hello young lady
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
The title scared me for a second thank god you actually didn’t luke
I’m early, cool
Congrats on the 6 million subs SMG4.
And so Luigi still fears the pain Once AgaIN
this episode is the alternative version of the memes that contains stealing
I'm Glad They Did Not Get Sued Just Like SML!
love that
Smg4 needs to do more stuff with luigi
When will the insulting mario video be out
Claim your here within an day ticket. Plus not one swear in this video
The concept of Lawyer Kong's LAW POWERS is awesome, it definitely made this episode cooler, wanna see more of that lol.
When are you gonna make the 6 million sub special?
good job on 6 Mil dude!
GUYS IT REAL 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
better call Saul then
So it finally happened…….BLAME IT ON BOB!!!
7:01 It's very strange and funny to see Mario without his mustache 👀
When does a new story arc starts
This is very good!!
6 million subscribers congratulations 👏🎉 SMG4
The ending confuses me on whether this is real, considering SML had this happen…
Remember what Nintendo took from roblox? They took "Pokemon Brick Brince", that Was amazing.
Please tell me there is another arc
2012: SMG4 almost gets cancelled 2022: SMG4 gets Sued
Yknow what, I thought we we're getting another Luigi's mansion, but honestly, this is a great deal.
Here in 17 minutes
ok
To anyone worried he actually got sued, I doubt it atm, He wouldn't have parodied this if this were actually the case and the video woulda been far more serious and somber with Luke and Kevin making the announcement if it were the case.  though honestly, I feel like Nintendo might be aware of sgm4's content already, just not really caring as much since it never portrays mario characters in really negative lights. I mean they did once invite him to a mario + rabbids event before, they wouldn't do that if they did not like what they were doing with this channel...
Oh goodness it’s good. ❤️❤️
Get sued
I was looking for some stuff with beef and this was the 3rd result
Hope he will never get sued
Honestly this made me tear up

I love when smg4 use power ups from Mario games :)
Gratulation to 6 Mio followers
That my dreams meme was so accurate.
Bruh, I thought that Nintendo really sued you
This was really good, anyone see an ark out of this?
Congrats on 6Mil
Happy 6 million!!!!!! Also wouldn't Meggy be part of the Nintendo property since Meggy was originally an inkling in inkopolis and Nintendo owns splatoon with number 3 coming out soon???
Wait did that actually happen?

Should have been Mario, not SMG4  Edit: didn't know Meggy got her own voice actor.  Nice.
Hi everyone.
Mario turning metal to act as a shield is actually incredibly cool, I love that
Will you be at GamesCom SMG4?
Here within half an hour
Sheesh very good video pls give me a undercover video to watch plsss👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💸👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
When's the release date for Super Luigi Gardening? When is there merch? When is there DLC? When do we get a Spin-Off? How Much is it? AND WHY ISN'T THERE A TRAILER WE NEED NINTENDO TO RELEASE SOME FOOTAGE!
Pay close attention to Maggie's animation it looks so amazing
On 20 mins and already 1.6k commented.
Sup
Here within 17 minutes tickets here
6 million! Heeelll yeah!!!
relatable
Your now back
First hour for the first time
I expected another arc but why SMG4 your know the only place I can make smg4 lore is my mind
I haven't watched SMG4 in a good while, and wow, 6 mil. This channel made my childhood and coming back about 4 years later is such a trip.  On a similar note, wow getting a little real with these videos now, lol.
I like this vídeo But i want to Mario 64 model
This was a really thought out episode concerning his channel is based around Nintendo IPs one wrong move and he could get in serious trouble 😬
At least Luigi didn’t suffer by the others actions, he gets to star in his own game.
I am here within the first hour yay :D
And this is a begging of an arc trust me guys
17k views within 7min lets go
Mario likes his moustache
E
Still wondering what would mario do if he would get selected as a president..
Fun Fact: The Other MarioTuber, named SuperMarioLogan actually got sued by Nintendo, because they made Mario and other characters become inappropriated
Ohno! SMG4! He's poor!
Plot twist, it's based on a real story
bro 1 hour gang
At this point I won’t be surprised if Nintendo asked the Japanese government to declare war on Italy because of the amount of people there named Mario and Luigi, hell they’re probably gonna sue me for mentioning them in this comment
Cool keep up the good work and congratulations for 6 million subscribers btw
Fun fact: smg4 stole the origanl Mario so nintendeo had to make mario a new personality. It wasn't until nintendeo got enough proof that they sued him
Helo guise
Congrats on the 6 Millions
Congrats on reaching 6 million subscribers, guys!
Por eso que rían Mario
of course nintendo lets mario use a gun, like that time he worked with rabbids, also luigi now has a game with his name on the tittle that isn't about ghost and vaccum cleaners
smg4 please make Mario play one night at flumpty
Nice animation
15 min ago
The my dreams meme is relatable but why-
Congratulations on 6 million subs hope you enjoy :)
5:22 mom?
Happy Milestone SMG4! I first started watching you in R64, The Mario trip to didney world! :)
Congratulations 6 millions subs
:)
E
Thanks you gave me a heart attack
YEA
Fudge
This was so calming and I really needed a post like this today! Much love
The animation keeps getting better and better.
I’m starting to realize there are two alternate universes of Mario: one that is not dumb and the other one that is.
Congrats on 6 mil, these videos are so fun
This is literally a certified SMG4 classic.
I was gonna say first SML now SMG4?
Tuff
badass animation style
Where can I buy this
4:00 - "NO GUNS! THIS IS AN NINTENDO GAME!" So why'd ya'll let Kirby have one?
Claim your other "Here within an hour ticket" here!
Mario and Meggy fights together and has a sad moment together, it proves they are meant to be.
Within hour ticket here
Okay, remember when I said we should stop assuming arcs? Well, this can be an exception... because I can definitely feel an arc from the ending of this episode
7:52 game theory
No one can take our favorite mario Luigi eh
It's like if Nintendo can't keep Mario or *ANY* of their IPs, then no one can. Nintendo's terrible, anyway. I mean, have you seen the recent news about Nintendo's sexual harassments?! 😡
2:54 music please
did u acctully get sued or is this a joke
Imagine if that game existed💀
Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiintendo whhhhhhhhhhhhhy
5:24 Mario: mom?
😂😂😂😂😂🤣
Im getting "if law was an anime" vibes
Congratulations on 6 million subscribers SMG4 😄
I STARTED CRYING AT THE END. I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO NE THE END OF MARIO
AYO 6MILLION FOLLOWER NOICE
4:08 Mario: Plus, Mario's super safe with em! Bowser: NO ur not. (Mario shoots bowser) Me: (Clap clap clap) yeahhhhhh I think we're done.
nais
Bro a gardening game with Luigi would actually be pretty cool though i want more Luigi based games
A mario game based on farming and gardening with an added adventure for the characters you collect to use the products grown and made now that's an idea if we could make that a reality it would be crazy
Loved the animation with Meggy and Mario during the fight. Each video gets more and more fluent with the characters body language and I love it.
Idea mario makes very bad jokes to smg4
Let’s all just pray this doesn’t actually happen😂
Did the Butt Ninja return?
Imagine: Buttered Muffin
Oh my god
Grrr
Congratulations on the 6 mil
Happy 6mi subs 🌚

I still dread the day when smg4 gets a dmca claim
Super mario Logan flashbacks
A relaxing Luigi gardening game would be pretty sick though
6:02 but isn't Splatoon a Nintendo game?
smg4 goes koo koo crazy

WOTFI 2022
Where's wofit 2022
5:16 *Ooooooh...*
This smg4 is r
I wasn't expecting this to ever be a video idea. Both funny and heartbreaking near the end.
Is it actually posible if we get a vidio one day without nentendo charectors i know it would be just as bad as SML but im curious how that would look like if this was real.
Luigi is gardening I did not know he can do that
6 MILLION SUBS
congratulations on 6 mil, SMG4!
SMG4 HIT 6MIL WOOOOOO

i would not like to imagine if smg4 would be sued like bruh what video is gonna make me laugh
What it actually do skedadudler
This kinda makes me worry about SMG4 actually getting sued. I men hell it almost happened to SML. Edit: also the Butt Ninja returns! Yay!!!!
Wait If SMG4 got sued, then why is Mario the one handcuffed?
Last >:)
Just like SML, not to use Nintendo characters for stupid stuff or memes on Gmod.
Meggy nous a fait une Masdask lol 6:15
Congrats on the 6 million subs, SMG4!
2:04- Only the ogs know that's Butt Ninja
No but like, have you ever had issues with Nintendo? If that isn't the case then you are very lucky I must say.
Also 6m let's gooooo
First 750 comment
Will we see Mario again
That's what I call the perfect Bond of Mario and Maggy.
Played around with the Name Mario and got sued into oblivion... Yep... Nintendo owns all Italians now... Luigi? He's a promotional table cloth... You aren't allowed to use him anymore... Now that I think about it... You look a bit like Mario... I'm sure they can claim your soul too
It this be the next arc? Btw, congrats on getting 6 million subscribers smg4. I wish I had that many
Somehow, I hope SMG4’s content can go back to normal in 2023
Glad to see Meggy in action, helping Mario from Nintendo and using her old lawyer knowledge to escape from the “Crease and Desist” paper
Hi
ima pirating games on wii u
This is basically big gaming corporations in a nutshell…not that’s there’s anything wrong with Nintendo, we love you! 🥰
Explicar 🤨
Did he actually get sues tho? That my question
Pls don’t get sued
Having a good day then [boom sued]
First
Congrats!
Honestly I'd play a Mario game based around gardening, maybe as like a mini game ala-PvZ where you could grow power ups.
6 milion subs congrats
Oh yeah she was a lawyer at one point smg4 you better lawyer you up to rescue Mario
SMg4  congratulations on 6M! 🥳🤯🎊🎉
Congrats on hitting 6 million subs!You deserve it!You will never disappoint! Trust me!You are always an amazing inspiration for so many!

Good job on 6m and also smg4 noo more mario
epic
SMG4 exists:   Nintendo: I’m about to end this boi’s whole career!  SML: First time?
Hi
I knew that Meggy going to law school would pay off. Plus Mario and Meggy make a great fighting duo.
Meggy's a hell of a lawyer...
Come on smg4 man replace that video with a fan collab instead of a lawsuit and order wannabe episode, another channel show should do that.
I just realized! It has been a while since Mario and Meggy have actually worked together!
congrats on 6 million subscribers I’ve been watching you sense 2019!
When you realize a meme guardian isn’t strong enough to fight against a lawyer
Best video ever
great vid man i love ur vids
Damn. Can’t wait for the splatoon 3 vid. Great vid though. Edit: happy 6 mil
lawyer kong real
FUN FACT fire power up Was going to be a gun but they wanted it to be in e rated game in da future so they made it a fireball
It finally happened!
6:47 first time mario fights without a funny face

i love how meggy says “booyah!” because she’s an inkling :D
Wth, why there is +1000 comments after 3 minutes of existence of this video
I have a good feeling this is the start of an arc
Congrats on 6 Million Subs, SMG4 Crew!! You totally deserve every single one!💖

6:14 Meggy broken the 4th wall

4:01 Ironically, SSBU has someone with an actual gun
Kinda surprised SMG4 didn’t get hit with any lawsuits for any criminal actions of the gang as well, considering the amount of crimes listed on the wiki pages for the characters
Wow
Wow 😃
At this point we're all amazed that smg4 irl hasn't gotten sued

Oh boy

Oh god WHO RATTED HIM OUT TO NINTENDO
Did something actually happen or did I just so happen to find this video 4 minutes after it was posted
Ok when they said that Mario Odyssey was 5 years old I had to check and holy I feel old WHY
Dang
After over a decade we actually have a video where Mario literally gets sued for his actions. Now this was actually the darkest SMG4 yet even more than War of The Fat Italians, I am surprised once again that this took a while but surprised we finally got to see this type of plot. Also congratulations on 6M SMG4 your journey of animation has truly come far.
Haha sued
4:30 POV : You save Zachary Hamada.
Smg4 gets sued huh I don’t what for

Noice
Is this Real?  Did you actually get sued by Nintendo?
You know, I generally thought Mario wouldn't be on speaking terms with anyone after the whole "abandon him to make world's biggest pizza while slowly making him go insane from isolation" fiasco last week. But hey, weirder things have happened on this channel.  Oh, and congrats on 6 Million Subscribers!
2nd day of asking you this: if Mario was in: Cult Of The Lamb
A
*Insert your reaction on this video*
Why am I getting flashback from another YouTube Channel...

Wow 6 million subscribers congratulations it deserve it
Congrats
First of all, congratulations SMG4 for getting to six million subscribers. Second of all, when I saw the title and thumbnail, I immediately thought that the worst would come. I hoped that SMG4 wouldn’t get into some actual legal trouble with Nintendo like what happened to SML. Thankfully, that wasn’t the case here.
0:16 My friend getting sued. 😤 😤
Sued =very bad
This is absolute Nightmare for SMG4, getting sued by Nintendo. Also, Congratulations on making it to 6 Million Subscribers, you deserve it!!

Meggy is Herói Smg4

Are we not gonna forget that Mario is the whole reason that this world exists and Nintendo is just abusing him?
Not good, congrats on six million subscribers by the way

I love You and your video

Where Is He
It’s been three minutes and there’s already 334 comments
Don't tell me this actually happened because if it did.... welp there goes the whole smg4 universe.
The first time 🥲
a
Welp atleast in the end luigi has another game for himself now
Congratulations for 6m subscribers
Looks like Mar- Wait... It's SMG4 this time that got in trouble?!
The reason why SMG4 is safe from getting cease and desisted by Nintendo is because Nintendo Of Australia doesn’t have the strict lawyers the American Nintendo has! Also, he at least still uses Mario quite well, even if he’s not doing good in quality in the last two weeks.
Claim your "deez nuts joke" here
Well, we spent all this time worrying if Mario was going to leave because of everyone hating him for the pizza..But turns out we didn’t need to worry about his friends turning on him.  We just need to worry about Luigi instead.
I knew SMG4 would release an episode covering this topic
Nintendo coming for me next
I watched you for for 2 years

I feel like the next one will be "Mario getting chased by the CIA"
