Whoa Captain Picard! Wow.
I thought the vibrating Z in German was the S.
nice accent 👌🏽
The last of us 🍄‍🟫🧟
I thought jack was gay weird
Lyanna mormont.
Bella's laugh and giggle is contagious, as Pedro once said in an interview
What is that "thing" on the right?
It is so cool that sir Patrick Stewart is from a few miles away from me. He definitely has lost his accent. He doesn't sound like he's from Mirfield at all. It's grim up north and he sounds so elegant.
Sup
Every single person who has ever lived has had an accent.
I see many say "everyone has an accent". Speaking with an accent means the way you speak significantly deviates from the norm in a country. The norm would be something like General American in the US or a less posh version of RP in the UK (something like "Estuary English"). Fer cumprison, ye cewld be wroytin leik zis and it would not be regarded as the norm, likewise with the way you sound. It could be a minor deviatyon, id cewld beh moyjor, khd boi inhcrmedzsible, could be regular, but it is something over which you have control and there is a "correct" way.
This was an incredibly boring story but I like her anyway!
Bella’s accent is sooooo smooth Yorkshire
BR is awesome.
Game of thrones !
Everybody on the planet capable of speech speaks with an accent
I never knew she was the voice actor of Hilda
Amazing actress, she's also landed some amazing roles.
Every Graham Norton clip has you tune in for one person you like and then the camera cuts away and it'll somehow be somebody even more famous
Omg if I met Sir Patrick and he looked at me so sweetly while I spoke I’d just melt ❤
What the hell is that creature on the right?
ok, she is just adorable.  Imagine, being that young, telling a story, and Patrick Stewart and Ralph Finnes are hanging on your every word.
Graham Norton has the best booking agent by far.
Do u see lol
Everyone has an accent, hers is just not particularly thick.  Liked the way patrick had turned to listen to her "ramble" even though it breaks the regular chat show etiquette of not turning your back on the host.
She's very talented
Winter is coming Lady Lyanna
Ralph, not Rafe!
What the hell is that thing sitting on her left? I swear reality is looking more like the hunger games every week
I was born and Raised in South-West Leicestershire and to me, she sounds like she's from North-East Leicestershire - Melton Mowbray maybe?
She is such a cute kid and talented as well
Still at the age of "I don't have an accent but you have one". "I don't think I sound different to you. But you sound different to me".
most pointless video ever
What a beautiful accent... as she tells us she doesn't have an accent. 😊
So is it a boy a girl or just crazy
Ralph spent 9 months training his accent. Then the day came and he proudly exclaimed 'Greetings, Mummy. Thanks for the gestation. I'll be off now.'.
Class
What does “RP” indicate?
Of course you have an accent, Bella! Everyone does...Even someone with posh RP has a posh RP accent...
How does she think she doesn't have an accent 😂😂
Ralph and Patrick are wonderful. I don’t know the young actress - I saw her in time, but haven’t seen her in anything else.  Her looks are quite distinctive. Like a medieval young lady.
Who the Heck is Bella Ramsey ?
They're awesome and really adorable ❤
The North remembers and so does the sort of Midlands... 😁
She obviously sounds British
at least Graham Norton let Ralph Fiennes finish his story first, then ask his question again. '😅😅 And Ralph's response was so adorable. 😊😊
She was absolutely incredible in Time.
It is the way they North that gives her away. The 'o' is almost like a short 'u' sound like in the word UH. I love it. I think it is so melodic. I assume all Americans feel that way about an accent that isn't our own.
She’s awesome
You can see why they are storytellers as a profession! Even telling fairly mundane stories about themselves they are engaging!
Wow, Patrick Stewart looks a lot older now, I didn’t recognise him at first.
I don't like her at all if my child was born like that I would have left her at the hospital
Speaking with no accent is like speaking in black and white. Celebrate your accent, it adds colors to everything you say.
I love her accent
I never noticed how much Patrick Stewart and Ralph Fiennes look so much alike
I forgot Ralph Fiennes was sexy.
Not sure why but there’s a little welsh in her accent…at least to me.
Dream daughter.
Bella— they are amazing 🖤💜🤍💛
Ralph Fiennes' has the best accent ever. The Grand Budapest Hotel just wouldn't seem right without him sounding as he does.
Really surprised at this appearance. She does such a good American accent in that sci-fi thingy, that I was surprised to hear she is English !  She isn't the prettiest of girls, but what an actor!! 😮
Bella's laugh is so cute😂😂😂
I was hoping this would explain her looks.  She definitely looks like she has since East Asian in her.
I don’t care how old she is. She needs media training asap.
Everyone’s got an accent
Tyson Fury's son
I so much agree with RP being a useful tool but that you should not let go of your accent even if you learn RP!
Ohhh there's a pig on bella left shoulder
Evidently she says the best way to pick up a US accent is swear a  lot.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I used to like her but now no because she has gone weird and I don’t like Graham and I like Jonathan Ross show even more now
It’s literally impossible to speak without an accent, it’d be like an object existing without a shape.
She's grown on me a bit, although her dialogue in TLOU didn't really mesh with Ellie's from the game at times.
She just sounds well spoken
I really don’t get why people think they don’t have an accent. Every single person in the world does. However your voice sounds - *that’s your accent!!*
Bella Ramsey is such a talented young actor! I have really enjoyed watching them in The Worst Witch, The Last of Us, and as Lady Jane Grey (in the series about a young Elizabeth I). I'm looking forward to catching up on GoT, also, and seeing them as Lyanna Mormont. So many great roles already!! - really anticipating what Bella will get into next.
The East Midlands remembers.
How delightful you are Bella love from Australia ❤😍
🥱🥱🥱🥱 very interesting 🥱🤔🥱
I love while women’s
The North remembers.

Hi Hilda or Ellie.
