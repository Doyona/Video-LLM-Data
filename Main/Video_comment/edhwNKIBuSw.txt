i love that tom literally js has to whoop to get the crowd cheering
W strange 7:10
6:30
Benedict is GOAT
I absolutely love how humble Benedict is! Most people who are as successful as him would totally gloat but he was extremely modest and kept directing the attention back to Tom, zendaya and Jacob 💙
Y do I feel Tom's girlfriend keeps on looking @ tom 4 support!?
🍟
6:26 Tom’s “HoW CoOL IS ThIs?!”😂😂
6:12 tom just spoiled that his contract expired
Basiozansdamioz  junta Bauiok  heuainajoz  mausimgoziok  Gasimozauisonr VA 😎❤❤🚘🤣🤣🤣 cocoon.
Zendaya looks like a billion dollars😊
معليش بس دكتور سترينج حسنه الفلم صراحه
Is Zendaya doing shoeplay in this video???
jacob's nervous laughter xD
Look at Tom he's glowing and morphing into a MAN.     So confident with Zendaya by his side I love them as a couple so much....AND Benedict don't get me started I've had a crush on him for years a very UNHEALTHY crush 🥳
Tom holland ❤❤❤love❤❤❤❤

Legos, Star Wars, death star with darth sidious by Ned
For what he does is the death star with palpatine / Legos, Star Wars Darth sidious Legos Star Wars Death Star what do you do he do?
He does it Legos, Star Wars
Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman she is the actress of Michelle "MJ" Jones
Happy Hogan is really Jon Favreau
Cinema cop said the criminal is really Spider-Man because his fantasy I don’t wanna betray Spider-Man website cinema cop it’s not really privacy and it’s not really public. It’s not really private. Public but the policeman. Cinema cop I am not happy with him. I blocked him.
Ooooh, “ what other secrets have you been keeping Tom?” WOW!😍😍😍
Zendaya be his girlfriend for real ft blood what’s goin on bro
Amy just just 😮😅 I just want you to see your baby 😮Baby good day baby Baby good night Love I miss you baby Baby good
👍💓💓💓💓💓💓😜😜💓
The fact that jimmy said “girlfriend”
Zendaya is overhyped. Her range is terrible and all the characters she play are similar to her personality. She's like the Rock, she isnt playing  a character; it's just her in these movies.
Benedict curling his toes at “one of the greatest actors…” 😂 he is though!
benedict sitting back  wasnt cool
Tom asla Benedict e sırtını dönmedi konuşurken. Bu düşünceli ve gerçekten saygılı bir adamın karakteridir.

1:28 - (@@) = "( i )" _
Tom literally nodding his head after jimmy called zendaya his Girlfriend😂😂
2,827
Jacob looks like an egg
such a pointed girlfriend comment, when theyve been clear they dont want to talk about it and they were publicly ousted against their will
6:20 😍😍😍😍😍😍😹😹😹😹
That was so bold of Jimmy to call Zendaya Tom's girlfriend right to his face on live tv, lol.
At 5:12 does Bennedict call Zendaya "Z"?? Because that's so freaking adorable!! 🥺❤️
Hiii Dearrs how are you ?
Hi from Ukraine 🇺🇦💙💛
What's wrong with the mr.doctors accent Doctor:It's strange Me: "Maybe who am I to judge"
Doesn't have any wife Allah
Lighthouse
Acid fly
why is zendaya wearing toilet paper
Benadict is so humble person.Just look at him. Love him so much.
nf fn nn ff🤔🤔🤔🤔
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
The way Benedict looked very closely at Tom🤣🤣🤣
the audience at the back is no annoying. have to turn the volume down every other minute
Love love love you’re alllllll🫶🏼👏🏻❣️❤️❣️🇹🇷🧼🧽🍽🧹🪣🧺🎉✅🤍🤪😝😍🥰😜😇😎😙
Everytime I see Tom, I see Tony Goldwnyn.
Zendaya LOVES LOVES 💞💞🖤🖤
I don’t know but would Tom Holland make a goodHarry Potter I think so
No one left behind in this interview
I jumped in the comment section as soon as he said girlfriend.
6:33-6:34 Jimmy: *calls Zendaya Tom's girlfriend* Me: SUS
wettest hugs at the start tbh
зендая в шторах пришла
Am I the only one feel so disappointed when Jimmy asked Tom, Zendaya and Job if there was anything they want to say about Benedict and the three of them were so silent? They seem didn’t want to say any nice thing about him. I don’t understand. I mean Benedict is one of the most talented actors nowadays and one of the most nice, humble men in the hypocritic Hollywood. If I were them, I might say nice words about him all day
Zendaya. YUM!
I tell you one multiverse doesn’t exists
“You seen the poster?!?…bring everyone!!” -Tom Holland 🤩😎😂 (4:27)
favorite movie EVER!!!
Just hi
Isn't obvious
benedict at the back seat
Tom did his RDJ style again  Perfection ✨✨✨
Benedict 🧡❤️💖
Tom and Benedict: *coming in politely and waving* Jacob and Zendaya: *coming in dancing like 7 yr olds* 😂
HE SAID GIRLFRIEND! ahhh tomdaya for life!
😇
How did she walk in those heels?😲
I love Benedict sooo much <3
Zendaya's outfits are always great to look at and admire.
I swear, the first Tom Holland interview I watched I thought he was faking his accent 😂 this is so cute
16:32 thank you for bringing that up
I like Benedict more with an American accent than his British accent.
4:39 Shout out to Jacob Batalon for not feeding his family dead bodies 🐓❤
Tom do you smoke
Ahh I love Tom and zendaya so much 🥲😭🥰
TOM HOLLAND 🔥🔥🔥
Zendaya is like Beyonce - needs no last name
When Jacob was talking about moving in with Tom he kept saying you guys and talking to Tom and Zendaya, sounds like Tom and zendaya were living together at that time
Spider man should have put in Disney plus.
:P
Benedict said to Tom “ don’t say that yet you’ve got one more” so they for sure making another movie with Tom as Spider-Man?
did Zendaya really said ‘poster’ imitating Tim’s accent on 4:33 🤌🏼 adorable
What episode and seasons was this on
Zendaya love
Z6aq8q8q😀😘😃😘
I'm scared if I watched the full version of the movie or not 😐
HUUUGE SPOILERS!  _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _ _ _ _ _ Oh hi there! May dies :)
Tom always looks like he has Benedict as a dressing coach to look the most british! hahahahha
Lol the pure pain on Tom and Zendayas face when he called Zendaya Toms girlfriend
I will come to repeat this video bcoz   i do not understood the video I understood the style of conversation In English , I'm only lesioning the voice + lipsing with subtitle
I'm convinced about half of Benedict's global appeal reside in his voice.
Zendaya’s smile is everything
They must feel so weird sometimes like so many people are clapping for them
great show of all time
I hope Jacob batalon gets casted more in other projects. Would like to see him actor more.
Is Tom and Zendaya actually dating
Was he reffering peters girl friend  or tom hall and girl friend
6:06
Zendaya does not follow trends, she is the trend setter. There is never a day she doesn’t look fabulous.
Benjamin cabbageman is looking at Tom the whole time with anxiety just going up
I love how tom is looking at Benedict  and Benedict just keeps smiling at how well tom was keeping secrets he's just a really proud uncle
It's the " girlfriend " for me but I think the reason on why the whole cast kept quiet is cause they know that zendaya and Tom holland are dating and I love how their relationship evolved it went from laughing together to eye contact  then now touching each other
0:24 tom abriéndose la chaqueta al puro estilo rdj, adoro
Girlfriend? I’m his girlfriend
I hope they like blue
Nowayhome
Indeed... Huge fan from sherlock homes...  😍😍😍
aw JACOBBBB
I'm surprised Jacob didn't brought the who community lmao
rue recovery era
Toms contract is up?
Is it just me or is Tom becoming more like RDJ
FaceTiming zendaya again
why does tom sound weird
Girlfriend!!!! 🤍😭😭 my heart ❤️
Girlfriend!!!! 🤍😭😭 my heart ❤️
Tom: you seen the posta -  Zendaya: Poster
"Theses guys are gen z im gen old" 🤣🤣🤣🤣
6:31 did he just said "your girlfriend"?
benedict's accent 😍!!!
Zendaya & Tom I rebuke you 2 in Jesus Name. Proverbios 6 31
these guys are gen-z and i'm gen-ooollddd is probably the funniest thing benedict has ever said lol
i never knew doctor strange was british….
Jacob is just genuinely such a good vibe.
“World premiere” except Norway where it didn’t premiere before last Friday
In our universe, tom holland slipped spoilers so many times but benedict cucumber cast spells every time he did so that we forgot about it.
I love how tom doesn't deny on the girlfriend part
Am I wrong to heard he said “Filipino is hell?” CAUSE THAT IS TRUE XD
Tom is wearing raised shoes? XD
when jimmy said girlfriend i could feel the crowd going wild inside i was so excited and had little chills in a good way we all wanted it
Anyone read lips? What did zendaya mouth to Tom? 😅😂
G... Kimmel must be the most boring presenter ever, still don't know why he has a show
Jacob's got a great personality!
I'm late but I've been waiting for someone to say that literally waiting
It doesn't matter how much you force NPC Holland onto the public, he will never be a convincing nerd, which is an essential trait of Spiderman.
GIRLFRIEND
That skiing comment hits different after gaspard ulliel... turns out those contracts are there for a reason ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
thats great
that bald guy is very full of himself
I like Jacob swag 😎 💯
Real talk, why is Zendaya wearing a slinky
Benedict looks like drama from entourage 😂
Why do I see noone but only Zendaya ! 😂❤️
Your right jimmy, we have been waiting for this movie for 9 years!!😂
Jimmy has no regrets with casually saying "calling your girlfriend" 🤣🤣🤣
i love that hes including benedict and jacob. i love them all!! benedict is so humble too and kind
This is probably the only outfit I do not like from zendaya lol
I see Tom Holland, Jacob Batalon, and Zendaya like the trio of Harry Potter film series Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, & Emma Watson. Hopefully Marvel-Sony will continue to make more spiderman sequels in MCU (another trilogy)
when jacob said 'im bringing family, it's going to be filipino as hell'  i felt that 😂
The way he said "you seen the poster?"
i ❤️ benedict
Benedict could play as Rafael Nadal if there's gonna be a biopic about him, his face and Rafa's kind of the same and I'm totally sure Benedict can do Rafa's accent and work out to get his body features  <3
6:14
Jimmy You are My heroe, You just whent straight up with the Magic word "girlfriend" 👏👏👏👏
Who's that weird guy next to zendaya
You can just see Benedict's discomfort at 7:39 when Kimmel calls him one of the greatest actors in the world.  He seems to be muttering 'ok' as if to say 'was that really necessary?'   :)
6:33 🤨😶😶😶
And I want to see him in Sherlock Holmes again...him means Benedict not Spiderman 😁
Remember God loves you!!😊 John 3:16  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Please turn your life around and repent. The clock is ticking..
the fact that jimmy called zendaya his girlfriend with no second thoughts and they didn’t correct him….
Gush..he didn't bother ask nor conversate toward Zen any questions as he did the men.. that geek!!
Zendayaa cakepp bgttt woii
I like this show keeping me in TAC thank you Jimmy!
Please invite toby, andrew and tom in an interview.
Best Sherlock ever!!!!
Zendaya trying so hard to be interesting and in convo
lol  @benoftheweek honesyly i thought he was here
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
There is the prank where you cover the house with toilet paper. Looks like someone did it with Zendaya or it is just a weird fashion. Not sure
jimmy sneaking in the word girlfriend so smoothly plss😭
I wonder how people reacted when they saw Tom and zendeya coming in the movie theater to see no way home
i hope soon new movie for this 4 actor
4:32 DAMN. idk what happend right there but it was *CUTE* aff
Lmao when he goes yeah you seen the poster
720p in 2021 why? Oh 2022 now btw
2 infjs :D
6:30 I like how Jimmy happend to say girlfriend and they didn't say no to it, they really are boyfriend girlfriend🥺❤️
LETS GO
lol the leaders of Generation Z vs a member of Gen Old
Spyderman is a weird guy in real life
😬
.05% of the people who watch this video commented. That's half of a percent engagement.
May: great power comes with great responsibility 🔛 Everyone deserve second chance 😅✌️
What’s wrong with Stranges eyes .
Just hearing Jimmy Say "Girlfriend" ahahahahhaa
Spiderman with british accent? Wooww.
Seen it ok
They are not gen z Benedict! They are zillenials!!!!
Too much British 🤪
Did he said girlfriend,?? 👀 (Jacob chuckles nervously)
What happened to that beautiful girl? Is she stuck in the shower curtain with her high heels and nobody tells her?? 🤫
Jimmy probably knows and legit just gave it away 😂😂😂
the way tom changes his accent when he’s quoting american people Lmfao
Dc could never
It’s crazy hearing they real voices wtf 😭😭😭😭
Is it just me or does jimmy look really tired?!
First time of Zendaya disappointing with her outfit.
That was smooth Jimmy. ngl😂
Tom and Zendaya are so level headed with fame. They have this modern and classic 90s vibe
Me replying it 4 times to see everyone’s reaction to him calling Zendaya Tom’a girlfriend
The way Tom says “you seen the postah” is so funny/hot to me 4:27
Love them, they are so natural and funny
Who pause the video after he said girlfriend
I love how Jacob is slowly getting the attention and appreciation he deserves, I'm rooting for this actor!
Why is Jimmy still on the TV, he stinks, there has to be someone better, get rid of him.
I love this team🥰 they’re so lovable 🥰
6:34 Man said girlfriend
Zendaya not doing Tom any favours by always wearing high heels hahaha
Jacob battalion is so funny
Benedict and Tom Holland so perfect
Such a lame interview. Bor-ing! Lol
Benedict is hilarious, I bet he's a blast to hang out with. 👍 🤣
Their chemistry is just........wooww 😍
When jimmy said "instead of going to the hospital you call your girlfriend" when he said that I felt so happy
Tom wearing plateau shoes so he can properly kiss his girlfriend!
Me too  I want to watch it again
Tom Holland is little Robert Downey Jr.!!
6:35 girlfriend 😳😂
6:32
So the crowd has to wear masks but nobody else does??
"I'm bringing more... I'm bringing a lot more... WhoOoOps"
Should i be looking at it like that?  lolololololololol u.m.
How humble is Benedict... could've took all the credit but he redirects it to the younger ones wow
Zendaya is always on point with the dresses.
6:33 and they didn’t deny 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣 Okay so shipper’s Day’s been made.. 🤣🤣👍
Please don’t let this be the end 😭😭😭
Zendaya is not taking her eyes off Tom trough the whole thing 🥰
How could Tom have American accent on the movie and sexy English accent in real life?!?
Dude looks like a Filipino Laurence Fishburne, ha ha
Jacob reminds me DJ akedimik. In everyway.
He is never old Benedict Cumberbatch
Benedict cumberbatch ❤️❤️
tobey schould be there to ... all actors
I have hope for this younger generation to bring forward togetherness and acceptance of each other, as opposed to the crazy baby boomer generation.
Jacob is so chill. I love his vibe
Gen Z? No Benedict, they are all Millennials. Lol.
06:10 contract's up....what does that mean...Tom no more spidey
Bc it’s convient and food and a pool😂😂
New mister and missis smith
Benedict is so cool
Uncle ben 🥺🥺🥺🥺💞💞💞💞
She is stunningly beautiful.
Wait hold on...!!  Is Zendaya and Tom really a THANG now?!
Hailey kelyeie jener et selena gomes gigi hadid kendal ahmer venic izroil venic amajadimeana venic esoles venic dukatati mana venic ta jug venic aseareia venic amajalengka venic
ya know Tom's a Brit when he says "we sore it"
A bit of nervous laughter
Now we need another interview, with the three... Generations... 😁❤️ Please make it happen... ❤️
Just taket a minute  and react how Good THE American  accent is in the movie right ???
I want to say that Cumberbatch or Benedict looks fantastic in the last Spider-Man. He looked hot
sometimes i forget benedict is not american
That's lovely but why is Zendaya being wrapped by toilet paper?
Billion Dollars made🤑🤑🤑
They clap almost everytime benedict talks
Zendaya casually making Tom look short
I love 'em big😍😍
The film was just out this world
Jimmy doesn't want to pass COVID to anyone but will give hugs with close-up faces. And he's on the pro mask/social distancing bandwagon. People like him are why folks don't and SHOULDN'T care about COVID
To have the power to make people say what you say and do what yo do. Tom Holland 0:49
No matter if you are short or  Being a women you have a 12 y.o boy chest.   If its your time you will surely be accepted.
Btw nobody is commenting on how when tom first enters he does that thing where unbuttons his jacket or suit just like robert usually does.
4:56 wowwww i never knew one can be chubby as a vegan 🤭🤭🤭
when z and tom breaks up next spring, it will be spiderman : on the dumping ground 🤣🤣🤣
2:20 You can see the panic in Benedict’s eyes as Tom starts saying the words “There was a scene...”. 😂
"THINGS JUST GOT OUT OF HANDS"
At the start, I think Jimmy always hugs and gives a kiss to the gals and gives a handshake to the guys, but I think Tom saw that Zendaya went first and he did it to Zendaya And he just thought, oh, that's how it's done. And then the others saw he did it to Tom so they followed suit. It was funny af
Can we just talk about how cute          Toms eyes are??
This feels just like The Hunger Games scene
i cant believe that jimmy really calls zandaya tom's girlfriend
6:32
I like this couple they aren't clingy in public just so easy around each other.
why would jimmy slide “girlfriend” in there like that 🥴
'Can we saw this" AGAIN" . line said by both at the same time.
2:28😂😂😂
i am in love with this whole cast hahah. jacob is the cutest person oml
it should have been me
Hollywood is way more away from the nepotism
❤️ Zendaya, Selena, &  Arianna... I think I have a type 🤣
Jacob batalon bald head like a egg😂😂 Isn't it👀
Jimmy started with Tom when they hugged, then the girlfriend part & Tom does snow definitely
When Jimmy slid in the word girlfriend felt like everyone was holding there breath for there reply
Why can't they just have two more sofas ?? 🤔
Tom wearing the 6 inch lift Manlet Air Maxs
Benedict letting the kids enjoy
At what time does he say gf
Make a romantic movie with tom holland and joey king please....🙏🏻
Did you hear that he said giRlFriEnd
TOM HOLLAND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@06:31 Jimmy announces their relationship publicly 🤣🤣 good banter
Benedict: Gen Z vs. Gen Old. 😁
Can we talk about how fly Zendaya’s outfit is!
These talk shows are out dated!!!!n boring not what I'm used to clicking on
Benedict is soooo cute
Kimmy Kimmel should keep to those sort of thing and stay out of politics and I'd probably watch him 👍
Tobey is the best spider man👍
ZENDAYAAAA I LOVE UUUU
Love them♥️🥺
😍😍😍😍
I really Miss CONAN
I genuinely love the fact that Jimmy is asking a lot of questions towards Jacob to try and make him feel included. I felt bad for him during most of the interviews because most of the questions were geared towards Zendaya and Tom.
Love the fact that Jimmy slid in the word girlfriend while talking to Tom.
Really love how Jacob is just vibing the whole time. He’s such an underrated person and plays such an underrated character, people should know and love him more!
I knew Zendaya and Tom are dating, but it sounds like they live together too according to Jacob.  8:17
I ran to the comments when he said “ girlfriend “
Zendaya 😍😍
This team is best ❤️💥
Always that one black person in these type of movies.
is it just me that is nervous for Tom Holland? like only me that's lowkey anxious he won't spoil anything with any/every word he says? lol
i think tom holland is the funny spidey hhhh
You know we are entering a New era when someone born in 1976 is Considered an Elder, by those born in 1996. I can only imagine the Rage of Gen X'ers right now and Boomers whom X'ers Raged against. How time Marches on.
Why is Jacob ACTUALLY so chill . I love it
HA! They came to the interview with their babysitter
Ngoke
4:26 "You seen the poster? Bring everyone."
⚡⚡⚡⚡💡
Just to make a point Tom Holland And Zendaya are actually dating....  The announced this when they were spot kissing in a car... So it's no surprise he called her his Girlfriend.
Benedict is the MAN! Loved his responses ❤
I legit teared up when Jacob said “ filipino as hell” and everyone clapped
Low key notice the soles on Tom hollands shoes
Jacob looks so happy to be there 😊😊😊😊😊
2:28 3:07
For anyone interested I made a video (with help) recreating a scene from Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man on this channel.
6:37  tom is a literal child
The applause breaks are beyond ridiculous. So obnoxious and stupid.
This movie is superb, amazing, emotional, value driven at same time
Why the HELL did you the best friend shaved his head?? Now he is unrecognizable and his few fans won't know it's him, there goes his Only chance to get laid !! :(
Are they dating??
Jacob had a major role in the movie this time
8:25 BatChest AN EXCLUSIVE!
Jimmy Kimmel: * not hesitating to say girlfriend*
When Jimmy said girlfriend I felt my stomach sink for Tom and Zendeya, they try and talk it off as if nothing happened. Everyone already knows but nobody mentions it, then Jimmy ruins the streak lol. 😂😂😂😂
I am waiting for the day when spider man   will not be able to fly anymore and he will be doing WORK FROM HOME
6:33 The couple was too  stunned to speak
Tom should be paying attention to the fact that those after his attention, include those who would like to hurt Zendaya and don't really care about him or the damage they do - either he's in and trustworthy, or he leaves her alone...
Lol tom holland can't keep  secrets he kept the biggest secret 👏👏👏
Cardboard personalities
"can we... watch it again 🥺??"
I like how Tom is like I don’t have to lie anymore and Benedict is like hold on we not there yet lol
First time seeing Benedict in an interview. Did not know he was English. Shouldn’t be surprised tho lol
Benedict is a great actor.
I saw the new movie today. It was awesome. I really liked it. They all did a great job as actors  :D
What is up with bendict’s accent?
Wait their dating?? Tomdaya are a couple???😳😳😭
Doctor strange is British?
Okay!!! What accent does Holland spoke in No way home... I don't like his Brit accent after watching No way home 5 times🙄
7:33 Benedict seems to get emotional, ahh :')
Why do they always bring Jacob 🤦‍♂️ He annoying and just the third wheel lmao
i love it what can i say
I went to cinema, and people just had a blast, it was al like NOOOOOOOOOO, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO , NOOO WAYYYYYYYYYYY NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
These guys acted really good in the movie
tom Holland's sitting style is telling me that he is just copying RDJ, as a RDJ fan i find that really hilarious but it’s cool cuz tom always says  that his biggest mentor and inspiration is RDJ.. best of luck tom for your Film.☺ i am really exited to  watch spider man NWH.❤
Wow! Tom Holland sounds a lot like Daniel Radicliffe this is my first time hearing him speak. I also got him confused for Timothy Chalamet look a like. Kind of wonder if Benedict watch Fantastic Beast yet? Lol
Is Zendaya wearing toilet paper?
3:06  Jimmy own Tom
sir!-spiderman..  steven be like no.. and change suddenly  dont call me by name.. yes sir-spiderman . LOL i love it
At 6:34 Tom nods his head at the gf comment like awwww
I love Benadryl Cabbagepatch he is my bestie
Just took my son to watch Spider-Man today !! It was absolutely awesome our favorite part of course was when all 3 Spider-Man’s came out ! We loved that…. Also had this interview on last night not knowing these are the stars of the movie I had my TV on mute so when I went to the movie I was like oohhh that’s who these people are, my bad … so now I got on here to watch it again and to listen to what they were saying ! Loved it
My country went Into lockdown the weekend before release. When benedict mentioned what his it whit a community made me realise 🥺🥺🥺
Jacob: *I'm not trying to push veganism on everyone*  The audience:  Starts chuckling then stops abruptly as flashbacks of the Vegan Teacher play... 🤣🤣
Yaaay' cannot wait to see this movie next week 💙❤🕷🕷
EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE IN THIS FILM WAS INCREDIBLE!! ❤️💙🕷
Benedict Cumberbatch is the greatest! 🥺 So humble, funny and caring, on top of all that talent, fame, and accomplishments.
Zendaya she is annoying,she is not pretty her acting in spider man she , she into herself the way she acts ,doesn’t fit in the character as MJ she sucks, they could of gave the character to some better acting and pretty
Tom  and z are two beautiful humans ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Y’all am I the only one who ever wonders what Zendaya’s last name is?????
I’ve seen it twice, too 🥳🥳
You could feel the entire room breathe in when he said" girlfriend", waiting for some kind of reaction.... lol
Zendaya I love you but what is that outfit?
Sit down Ned
I can’t wait until we can finally, openly talk about the movie
zendaya's choice of cloth is cool
Can someone ask Benedict when are we gonna see Sherlock?
Benedict not in the front seat is such a strange sight 😅
0:26 and he did it again
JAVOBS NERVOUS LAUGH WHEN JIMMY SAID GIRLFRIEND AHHAAHHAHA
zendaya is slaying everyone with that outfit
7:30 Oh my god look at those tears at 7:42
Proud Filipino 🇵🇭 can’t wait to see it
Jimmy is 54?! No Effing way!! He looks at least 48. The nonchalant way to throw in GF in the conversation lol 👏👏. Nice one Jimmy. I love this cast. And Benedict is more daring and he’s older lol.
RIP Aunt May
I had to check the comment if I heard that right 😂
Ours got delayed til Jan 22nd..huhu (Philippines)
Not jimmy throwing that girlfriend term Willy nilly😂😂
I've seen this full interview, and Jacob's laugh is so contagious HAHAHAHA 😂😂💗
BRO Jimmy just slid that "girlfriend" in there with no hesitation. Let's go I am 💀
I guess first of all I can change the channel. What I'm seeing is not live. Then, you could of had the 3 guys that played the hulk and a few characters from the previous movies on your show and I would of been better impressed.  Spiderman, Superman, Batman remakes. I am over it. Ummm hello, there's other comic book characters that deserve there 15 minutes of fame.
someone tell me why Benedict Cumberbatch looks like the actor who played ron weasly in Harry potter
Tom is so lucky. God Zendaya I'd perfect
Hopefully Tom doesnt spoil anything
Zendaya's look is a mix of Euphoria and classy
I love how Benedict was just letting em have their moment like,he just sat there like some random actor who just had some role in a movie and was just a minor
the thing they had to learn from Doctor strange  Be calm and SCOOBY DOO THIS SH*T
What a great movie, a Spider-Man we needed
The chemistry between Benedict, Tom, Zendaya, and Jacob is super cool to see. You can tell they are great friends and will continue to be great friends in the future. Mad respect to all 4 ❤️
Still meeting your ex as if nothing happened is really....
Aren’t they millennials not gen z? I thought but I could be wrong. I though gen z was high schoolers
All I want for Christmas is to watch Spider Man No Way Home with the cast of the movie. Happy Holidays 😄
Zendaya looks like the world’s most  glamorous mummy. She makes anything look fabulous.
Happens at 6:36 guys
hang on, the audience have to wear masks but the cast and host don't?  What, does Covid know who to infect?
hi
Benedict is so classy. Best actor and lovely man! Wonderful he is so versatile.
The way he just slipped the word "girlfriend" in the sentence 😅😅
Bro just slide in the girlfriend there like 😭
here watching the interviews cause the movie doesn’t comes out till january in our country (philippines)
This is actually such a cool interview
Casually sliding the girlfriend thing,,, so cute 🌹 hhhh
LOVE BENEDICT !!!!
Just watched the movie......i cant express my feelings rn. i want to tell so many things but dont want to spoil it for others. Marvel truely has made a masterpiece
nobody :  jimmy kimmel : Zen DIA
Wait. When Jimmy said Jacob and Tom lived together. Jacob goes yeah because 'you guys' had a lot of food. Not Tom but multiple. Does that mean what I think it does? 👀
Keeping my caption on cause of benedict lol
What's up with Tom's shoes? Does he need those to get on certain rides at Disneyland?
I just watched the movie yesterday and i’m still shaking from how good it was.
Are we all going to pretend Benedict isn’t the biggest star seated there but he chose to give the spotlight to the Tom, Zen and Jacob!   Urrgghh my favourite actor is such Heaven-sent! That was really thoughtful of him & I love his chemistry with Tom. Like a proud parent.
The hugs are back???
So Tom and Zendaya were the only two cast members allowed to see the movie before the premiere?
7:40 - Such a British reaction to a compliment. 😂
6:36 the most important moment
He really said “you see the postah send everyone”
cuties
MCU is the gold standard for movies. Period.
They always have to send Benedict with Tom to make sure he doesn’t spill anything 😂
I really love a lot BENEDICT and DOCTOR STRANGE. Really Love This Man.
Tom's hair is perfect.  Just sayin...
Tom is such a good person♡
Anyone noticed Jacob wearing the most common h&m flannel
I absolutely loved this movie!!!
I can stand Zendaya! She melts my heart ♥️
Anybody else get butterflies in their stomachs when Tom suddenly transitions into an American accent, then back, like nothing happened???
Jen Garner, I would like to tell you not to bother anymore about him. Ben and JLo  are just for each other  - Vanity Fair!  And you and he were  diametrically opposed.  You thought that you  could change him. Alas, your efforsts were in vain.  And that is why he   was feeling trapped.   You   should   have seen that he  is not  to be confined and that he could   be told and commanded what to do.  He is still a teenager in his psyche and so is Jlo. Both  are infantile. God bless them!
"Your Girlfriend" stole the show
tom's accent transition is just unreal
Nice to see Peter, mj, and Ned are friends again and remember each other
amazing 😂❤️👍🤩
Wow to HD
feel bad for Benedict Cumberbatch he is a pretty good and senior actor seeing him sit in the back on a chair like thag only makes me think how the teen audience's hype about the tom and Zendaya's relationship has taken over the PR.
I love all of their outfits somewhat color cordinated
Can we just acknowledge that Tom always unbuttons his suit whenever he comes on this show 😂 00:25
Literally my jaw dropped when jimmy said “girlfriend” even though ik that.
If they tried to keep the secret, so they just talking bulshit, like there's would be mysterio join the film, or something else,, simple.
Everyone becomes so cautious whenever Tom is speaking, in case he ends up dropping a spoiler 🤣🤣
does jimmy sick  ?
Baby Dwayne Johnson
Tom saying "can we see it again?!" Is ME yesterday when I finished watching the movie!
I loved spider man ❤️🔥
What did jacob say at 3:44?
That dude Jacob is so annoying
Great interview! Every moment of this episode is so much fun to watch ☺️
Benedict can't watch Tom talk LMAO He's like there he Goes with another spoiler
I wish Tom Holland would call Benedict Cumberbatch, uncle Ben 😢
Tom gon spoil benedict 🤣
Tobey Maguire is the best Spider-Man ever!!
Big fan from Bangladesh ....
Jacob Batalan is the best actor of all of them.  He's funny and has great superpowers.  Love him.  Put a native American actor in the next Spiderman movie.
The movie is best till date
Haha what a hint at the beginning
Is that Sherlock HOLMES ☠
Just saw the movie. Absolutely fantastic. Cannot describe it better, it really needs to win some awards for the amazing job done for this film!
Hope you have a Merry Merry Christmas with your fam Jimmy Kimmel
Jimmy: ending the vid before when its break time. Me: I've seen that clip because I watched the whole movie today.  P.S. Jimmy Kimmel is the best Television Host Ever
Hmm so him and zendaya were living together during the first movie aye 🤔 "THEY were close to the studio" hmmmmm
its 2021 and people are still uploading videos in 720p..............
I respect Jimmy a little bit more after watching NWH
Benedict is so sweet
Saw it  And its a masterpiece
Why is Zendaya wearing toilet paper?
No one noticed that the suit Tom is wearing here is the same in terms of color matching as the one Zendaya wore on Graham Norton show!
I can’t believe all three Spider-Man in the movie
Jimmy is savage….just casually dropping the g word without a care!!!
the best movie ever  10/10
Jacob real Filipino....the food always a factor hahahahaa
All Great Legends!!!!!!  All Blacks!!!!!!!! Only The Best!!!!!!!!!!!
Tom Holland's real accent is sooooooo funny😅
2:08 that's how everyone reacted when they saw it
I loved the movie so much but so many mixed reactions
The film sucked TBH
Distraction for the WORKSLAVES
Benedict chill as always, man is so calm
Benedict's winning an oscar this year
6:33 finally (◕ᴗ◕)
Benedict always stole my heart ❤️
Kimmel is right when he says Benedict is one of the best in the Industry, he is this generation's Bob DeNiro.
It's hard to not hate that goblin dude. But like you gotta make the mind that it's just a movie
dude, am official a tom holland fan, he is literally so cute and down to earth. him and Zendaya are such a cute couple
That is the most amazing movie I have ever watched! So sad but so good at the same time!!!
Tom looks like his mentor Robert Downey Jr
I refuse to believe that tom's contract ended.. Please do more spiderman movies!! I can wait a couple years
“you’ve seen the poster?” LMAO

Kümmel just said girlfriend right? Anyone else catch that???
Making Benedict sit behind is really disrespectful!
love how tom walks in like rdj
No way home ❤️
Wow. This is the most interesting and hilarious interview I’ve seen. Really everyone joins conversation seamlessly. Really love it!!
Love Zendaya's outfit here!
Of all the Avengers and MCU actors, I love RDJ the most, ever since high school when I saw him in Less Than Zero but I have to say that Benedict is also on a different level when it comes to acting.
Absolutely loved the movie.
Who peter parker?
Jimmy can't contain himself. Shame on him
If you look closely, Tom Holland put his arm out expecting Zendaya to hold his arm when they walked out together
Leave it to Jimmy to confirm that Zendaya is Tom Holland’s “girlfriend”. Thanks Jimmy
WOOOOO VEGAN!!!
I saw it yesterday and it was incredible and so emotional. Not gonna lie, it was one of the first marvel movies I had seen. Totally recommend!
Is this the talkshow zendaya said her and tom were gonna throw up bc of how nevous they were?
Jacob carried Far From Home, now he will be carrying No Way Home.
I like when Jimmy said "The restaurant" after Jacob mentioned crossroads, not to confuse the audience he actually was going to make a pact with the devil
These people make a good team and they are so comfortable
benedict cumberbatch is definately one of the greatest actor in the world
Nicen
What happened to the clip lol
Jimmy dropped a spoiler ig.
I dis like this video because you give normal chair for strange instead of sofa
Jimmy: Have you seen the Spider-Man movie? Benedict: Well, I'm excited but I haven't seen it. Jimmy: Why haven't you seen the movie? Benedict: Because I'm excited to SEE it.
ur what🤨🤨🤨🤨
I love how Jimmy said " You call your girlfriend" ❤
What a pleasure it was to see Spider-Man: No Way Home... Tom Holland and Sir Benedict were great!!! It was wish fulfillment to the extreme! I wanted to cry out of joy of seeing _them_ together!!!
In the era of everything is spoiled on the trailer. Kudos for the sony and disney to keep the ultimate yet anticipated suprised that we could only seen it on the cinema.
Jotaro
I miss the Andrew Garfield Spider Man Area
I saw it yesterday and it was incredible
CONFIRMED <3 6:33
Tom has become so much confident. You can see it in the way he seats, talks, he's really comfortable.
Frl Jacob will have great career! Just watched the movie and he was really good and he has a lot of screen time🕷
I see a resemblance of RDJ in Tom’s body language
I'm just so proud with the whole cast of this movie! Imagine the pressure of keeping everything in SECRET. That's not easy esp. if you're too talkative like Tom lol
2:20 -- if you've seen the film already, you probably can take a wild guess at what scene he's referring to, there.
Why they don’t dress like the characters on the movie? I want to see them like that n not on “normal” clothes, isn’t them promotion Spider Man?!
Who else is here after watching No Way Home!!!
6:32
Tom just cant stop
I love this interview but has anyone noticed how ONLY the audience is masked but the celebrities can hug and it's okay or am I in crazy town here? Anyway... Carry on.
slick 🤣
This is just extraordinary 🥴😭😭😂😂
When he said girlfriend I genuinely froze up, LIKE HE JUST SAID NO REGRETS
Is it just me or Tom and Zendaya has a similar face?
Apparently Tom confirmed his relationship last month with Z. I wish them well. They look great together 💙
tom wearing platforms.
he did the unbutton thing again
This show is complete garbage. Imagine not having your own opinion
Great, awsome movie.. amazing!
it was such a good movie didn’t want it to end 😭
Here after seeing the movie.
I love Benedict. I just do.
YOOO JIMMY SAID YOUR GIRLFRIEND
the two ather spider-man need interview
I hope we see more Jacob in bigger roles. Pinoy Pride!
Tom Holland is a great spider man can’t wait to see this movie it’s gona be so epic
No thanks. Keep that garbage cast where it belongs. Into the bin.
Love the fact that Jacob is getting a lot of love in the comment section
Spiderman:No Way Home was a whole damn experience. These four are amazing!!!
cmon i wanna see interview of Tobey,  Andrew and Tom together
Andrew: Guess I am the werewolf
Immediately wanted to watch it again after it finished as well
Tom holland : wants to say that Tobey and Andrew are in the film        Marvel : “Im gonna put some Dirt in your Eye”
Yay Benedict best ❤️🔥🔥🔥
I've seen on first day and first show ,yeah this is best Spiderman tribute that we will get ,this one one gonna blow every one mind 🔥
Jcncjfjfjfkddj
The fact that benedict was so excited to wacth it has to be one of the most los key spoilers ever. Why World he be that excited about a spiderman moviendo if it wasnt for you know
And ofcourse a vegan mentioning hes a vegan🤢🤢
4:49 That Vegan Teacher be like: That's an X. You must share this wisdom whenever you can or else you're an ANIMAL ABUSER.
"Never had met" lol
Who in this world records show at 720p
Just got done watching the movie it was great I can't believe aunt may die but overall it kinda was expected because peter needed to learn about responsibility in this trilogy so it had to happen
Whatttt a perfect heart Benedict made !!!!!! OMG !! Love them all !
Just watched this movie. JUST AMAZING!
Watch at amc and enjoy it with and audience
Benedict Cumberbatch look sooooo great 😍😍😍😍😍💓❤️💞💞
just came back from the theater...definitely tons of secrets there!
It is a great Spider-man movie with lots of surprises
They are now "We". I love that
Did Kimmel just put Tom and Zendaya or is it an open secret?
Agree with Tom. After I finish my reaction is can I still get ticket to the next one
Best spiderman movie ever made. You guys let us get all what the fans wanted
Tom is a little cinnamon roll I love it
The ended for spiderman is sad🥺🥺
Jimmy think he slick we all heard it 😂😂
Benedict Cumberbatch
So nice to see Eggs Benedict Cucumber Batch here.
Benedicte is classy !
Crossroads is actually an amazing restaurant!
The secret is Zendaya isn’t attractive 🤫
Jacob is so chilled and cool, let’s put the light on him more often 🧡 thx Jimmy
Omg every time Tom talks I get anxious for everyone over there.

Now that's what you call stylish rags
Violating Medical Ethics Declan Lyons, Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry from School of Medicine Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, said it is unacceptable for medical professionals to remain silent when facing such severe actions that undermine basic ethics. He said the moral decay at any place would endanger the medical ethics in that region.  He said that such a large scale of immoral behavior in China is an insult to the medical profession – one cannot be an executor of a regime’s persecution policy and a guardian of people’s life at the same time. These two roles are mutually exclusive.  Lyons said that unfortunately, most medical professionals around the world are unaware of the forced organ harvesting or refuse to believe its existence. The medical professionals’ attitude towards forced organ harvesting will erode people’s confidence in them. For example, if another pandemic were to break out, will people listen to doctors again? After all, if doctors could tolerate forced organ harvesting and choose to do nothing, why should people still believe in them?  He commented that the persecution of innocent citizens in China has damaged moral values and that people’s lives have become part of the CCP’s assets. Prisoners are detained and tortured, and they could lose their lives at any time.  Although not a Falun Gong practitioner himself, Lyons said he feels obliged to speak for them. The persecution of Falun Gong has lasted 22 years and is too long, he said. Moreover, the principles of Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance are universal values for all of us.
He’s 54 😳
54 years old!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I want his secret
No leak but DAMN the greatest one in the century
Jimmy Kimmel seems very fake to me.
ENFPx2 - INFJx2 huuum 🤔
Yes, tobey and Andrew are in the movie .
I feel so relieved and happy when he doesn't say anything about a hamster in the end...😅
the movieeeee was beautiful!!!!!!!!!
“for the world to now have it” the philippines: 🙂
Tom Hollands brittish accent is like an american trying to do a brittish accent....
jimmy accidentally called her his girlfriend😅
How many spderman movies can you watch?  Movie industry "let's do 3-4 per year, same story, radioactive spider bites the kid , but different actors "
Zendaya is so gorgeous. 💜
DID HE JUST CALLED ZENDAYA TOM'S GIRLFRIEND
so new to my eyes to see a pinoy actor with that face, refreshing!
Where is Aunt May?
Tom I love you
JIMMY IS 54!?!
Why why why is it so easy for me to watch 60 interviews with Fallon, but impossible to get through 2 minutes of Kimmel
Spoiler:  MJ gives Peter coffee
it's easy to forget Benedict and Tom are British. they spoke good american accent in movies.
Tom trying to not say a spoilers  Big fan tom
Benedict Cumberbatch looked so stressed when Tom was speaking
Just went to watch the movie, seriously the best movie ever. It's very sad and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The croud's reaction was all over the place. You all will love it
Can someone tell Tom say bottle of water
We all know that Benedict is there not only because he's in the film, but because he keeps Tom in check lol
Andrew is in the movie
Is it just me or does Tom Holland lowkey looks like Tom Hiddleston 🧐🧐
I feel like the only reason Benedict is there is to babysit Tom so he can't spoil anything
I am not loving the sight to see Benedict Cumberbatch sit at the back seat. 😡😡😡
Proud Filipina, here! hehehehe
in spanish we say " el que calla otorga"  😁
I was shocked when Jimmy said “girlfriend”
The movie is the best every marvel fan will love it
Hi.... In India Today was the release so anyone wanna know the spoilers?
I’ve seen here in Australia Greta film didn’t expect Toby in a Spider-Man role after a long time
best movie i've ever watched
Andrew? tobey?
« You can bring 4 people » Definitely not gonna work😂😂😂😂
My attentions were caught by ZeÑdÄyâ
I just saw the movie and man it blew my freaking mind away
The gf word took me so by surprise
3:19 if movie doesn’t start with an exterior shot I will be making a very angry tweet 😂
Tom needs a haircut.
I just saw Spider man no way home and i'm glad to say three spider men were there!
No doubt that Benedict is one the best actor in the world
The Gospel: We sin against God and for our sins we deserve hell. We fall short of God’s perfect standard for heaven. But the good news is we have a way to be forgiven, that way is through Jesus. Because he loved the world, he came, lived a sinless life then died on the cross for our sins, paying the price for them which is death. He was buried and rose again on the third day. Because Jesus did this for us the gift of eternal life from God is offered to everyone. All we must do to be saved is put our faith in Jesus ✝️❤️🙏
1:56 someone just farted 🤣
I love jacob than spyder man
Aunt may dies your welcome
Could Benedict be any cooler?
fantastic film must watch film especially the end credit scenes!!
Conspiracy theory: they added Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie to spoiler sit tom Holland again 🤣
Need to meet zendaya’s stylist cause whatttt!!
why is Tom Holland looking like Loki lol
Who's here after the movie 😂
watched it yesterday best marvel movie imo gonna go watch it again 🔥🔥🔥
The movie was so gooddddd
But the real question is if Zendaya did wear Tom his outfit in a different interview
Since when does the star of a film not sit closest to the interviewer? And she walks out first? Lol. Feminist world we live in.
jimmy called zendaya tom‘s girlfriend 😍 so cute
I love Garfield and Toby in this movie was amazing sadly aunt may died :( danm that goblin
By March the mainstream media will be telling you how the flu and influenza have made a great comeback.... Coincidentally the test they use for covid will be able to separate covid from the flu in January
Loved the movie❤❤❤
I hope tom will not spoil it this time. January 8 is the premiere in our country. Huhuhu
Who came here after seeing the movie.
jus watched the movie, so sad to see aunt may died :(
I think Benedict Cumberbatch need to be the next James Bond.
I've watched the movie I thought it gonna be vfx oriented action stuff but Movie is all about emotions
Me hearing the word girlfriend and comming straight to the comments 😭😭😂
The GF lineee 🥺❤
Am I the only one who’s watched it already??
Meh. Batman is better
Benedict is a classy guy, he let the 3rd wheel friend walk out before him<3
Bendict ist so handsome 😍
Bendict ist so handsome 😍
Bendict ist so handsome 😍
Jimmy is so proud of himself.
Am I the only one who see RDJ in Tom 😅😅
IN SO EXCITED HOLY FREAK
Bruh how I paused the video so fast as soon as Jimmy said girlfriend lmao
Just look at Benedict I mean he is such a genuine gentleman I mean look at him what a posture what an actor I will see Spider-Man for him alone !!
Did he say “your girlfriend”???
Wtf she is wearing. 😂😂😂
THE WAY JIMMY JUST SAID GIRLFRIEND WITHOUT BEING HESITATE OMFG

Jacob lowkey looks like "The Rock"
Did Jimmy just say Girlfriend.... OMG its official!!!!
I'm excited  to watch  Spiderman   "No Way Home '🥰🤩😋😊❣🤘🕸🕸🕸.
Benedict Cumberbatch 😍😍😍😍😍
Top
Obviously he saw t he’s the main character with Tobey and Andrew lol
i saw the movie aunt may dies and the 3 spiderman fight Zendaya almost died but Andrew saves her and tom almost kills the green goblin because he killed may but tobey stops him and the goblin stabs tobey but tom injects the serum and Norman comes back and Tobey doesn't die
The movie got spoiled and posted on tik tok, and people are being jerks and spoiling it, so I deleted Tik Tok.
2019 Far from home 2021 No way home 2023 I found a new home
Wow. Benedict's comment was so heartfelt. Respect!
it fells weird hearing jimmy say girlfriends when referring to zendaya for tom but like super happy about it
Jimmy Kimmel must be so depressed
I just watched a couple hours ago for my birthday and omg it was so good I don't cry in movies even if its hoppy or sad but I cried three times
Tom's wearing the same colors Zendaya wore on Graham Norton!!
6:31 “instead of going to the hospital you call your girlfriend” BROOOOO
tobey and andrew were indeed in the movie im now the comment u wished u never saw
Lowkey cringe
Happy to see Rue doing well for herself
Tom has been through so much punishment in the making of spiderman no way home that he doesn't even care about a bit of bleeding on his face 😅
Why not the whole cast is promoting.. 🤌
so excited to watch this in theatre😍
When Jimmy said „…you call your girlfriend“ I was surprised because I didn’t know their relationship was THAT official
Benedict Cumberbatch 😍
Poor Andrew and Tobey. They're supposed to be there with them.
Read the comments with caution because there are people spoiling the ending of the movie 😭😭
Jimmy said “girlfriend” and the whole set just went dead quiet 6:30
🔥🔥🔥
Jacob Batalon def got the most drip out of the group.
Peter is wiped from everyone's memory at the end so nobody knows he exists, also all 3 spidermans are in it :)
Two big leaks 1) Andrew and Tobey are indeed in the movie 2) Ante may dies in the movie
Jimmy dropping the word girlfriend so casually shocked me so much that I gasped and had to pause the video💀
I saw the movie today and its epic!!! Im not going to spoiler but let me just say it got way abouve me expaction!!
AUNT MAY DIES, ANDREW N TOBEY R IN THE MOVIE, ANDREW CATCHES MJ, VENOM IS IN THE END CREDITS 🇬🇧
benedict pls be my dad
Not MJ. NOT SM.
If Tobey is in the movie then it will smash end game and infinity war combined easily
The way that I’m such a simp for Zendaya
Just watched the Film, W Movie Personally my favourite marvel Film so far
Who’s here after watching the film? Spider-Man reunion just happened.
I love how they aren’t wearing masks but everyone in the crowd is
We are in Indonesia are lucky, we’re able to watch No way home earlier, Dec 15.  Do you guys need any spoilers ? Hehehehehe
The the character that Jacob Batalon plays. It's such a needed and perfect accompaniment for Peter Parker and Jacob does a great job playing him...and being there for him. Much love Jacob!
i actually rlly like this interviewer ,it seems like he’s actually trying to include evryone
The way that Jimmy said girlfriend so casually with ZERO hesitation 🤭 I was so caught off guard I had to pause and collect myself.
He said girl friend 6:35
I've just seen the film, it's great, can't wait to see more interviews with the cast ❤️
Cuties
Yo it's the rock's younger cousin the pebble
Jacob got added to fortnite recently budget rock

Zendaya 🔥
Spoiler Alert: Zendaya's been reading Mistborn. Either that, or her designer has.
Jacob is such a cool guy, happy he’s been getting asked some questions!
Some idiotts , already spoiled the secrets  on youtube, I request you guys , don't search anything related to spiderman no way home, unless you watch it in theatre, if you don't like spoiler, well, about me, if it's there or not I don't care , 😂😂😂 I'll watch the movie anyways 😂
it should be dropped all the same day idk why they did it like that
Aunt may dies guys
Why are there so many SpoilerClips from the Movie on YouTube… like Fr… as soon as I refresh the site - Boom - Spoiler Clip
I'm hyped going to see it Sunday!!! 🔥🔥
Can i just say us brits already have it in cinemas, we dont have to wait till friday it started today... i saw it... im not gonna spoil it... but ALL THE RUMOURS WERE TRUE
When Jimmy said that  Zendaya was Tom's girlfriend I was expecting some awkward faces but they all seem so comfortable with it now <3
7:24 keep clicking that
wahoo
I truly don't hate anyone but boy do I, don't like Jimmy Kimmel
Aunt may dies
Just carious that why Jimmy says the movie will release on Friday but some movie theater release the movie on Thursday Dec. 16 2021 already?
the crowd started cheering on 'Tom Holland' but as much as I like him Benedict Cumberbatch is my chive.
Watched it today it was mindblowing still not over it
Well, this interview proved everything we needed haha. Since when has Tobey Maguire been to a Hollywood party in a while? Can’t wait to see Tobey and Andrew in theatres!
Jimmy get some sleep bro 😂 😂
Zendeya rocking the crazed riddler suit from the end of batman forever 😄
This movie was so good but I am so sad now. Do other people feel this way too after they watched a movie? Like post movie depression or something lol
good to see tom's legal babysiter's with him.
Zendaya looking beautiful as always
🕷🕷
drones
Why did he call her girlfriend??
Jimmy is annoying af
I think neds a douch in real life he talks like a douch he looks like a douch and i get a very salty vibe from him he seems very envious of tom.
It was a fun movie, more action than some of the reviewers were saying. Also - stay to the absolute very end - even after the Sony / columbia pictures final logos. :)
Love to everyone but big love to Benedict ❤️
Benedict looks handsome
Tom Holland is canceled.
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq  Programmierer der Master K. I                            !
Wait I didn't know they were together
6:20 The captions.... :)
I know this isn’t important, but Tom didn’t correct Jimmy when he called Zendaya his girlfriend.
just watched the movie. and Mann this movie was the best
Jimmy sliding in the girlfriend bit so casually was the highlight lmao
Amazing video! God bless you all🙏🏽God is so good🙌🏽Jesus loves us all so much🙏🏽❤Turn to God He will guide you and give you strength🙏🏽Trust in Him
Tom unbuttoned the coat again like as he got attention for rdj style
Zendaya : we’ve seen it  Holland: we’ve saw it  Me : 🤔🤔
Doctor strange just said.  "Don't celebrate yet".  "You got one more!" (secret).    Did you guys catch that.  Sounds like Peter is in the new multiverse of madness.
Well Andrew was SUS 😳.
Why does Tom’s side view give me Loki vibes 🤣😆.
Tom is wearing platforms
Jimmy is 54?
So is it official? Zendaya and Tom as couple?
So much respect for them, theyve been having so much interviews lately
The airport will be filled with filipinos in america in 16
Tobey Maguire, hands down the best spider man.
Noice.......
Yep, Cumberbatch was absolutely amazing in Power of the Dog.
All in it allllllllllllllllllllllllllll
Is BC there to silence Tom when necessary? Again?
The way Bennidict Cummerbatch wants to shut Tom face every times he starts talking at 5words/second speed is halirous 😂
Zendaya is not perfect for MJ
I thought the comment section would be full with comments talking about Jimmy calling Zendaya Tom's girlfriend 😅😍
,,I moved in because THEY lived close to the studio" They?😏 Daya and Tom or was Tom living with his brother? I NEED ANSWERS
Gen Z and Gen Old here in the comments, too. All the 13-yr old girls carrying on about, "OMG he said, "GIRLFRIEND!!👀!!" and then old me thinking, "He did? Even so, it's old news. And, who cares?"
I bet after the movie is out Tobey & Andrew will be doing talk shows with Tom.
Dont know why I was so afraid that Tom will spill some spoiler
Tom is looking so mature and hot. Love it.
Jacob is Filipino but the movie is delayed in the Philippines 😢
Im literally seeing it today in Germany though lol
I got tickets tomorrow morning 6 AM 😏😏
NO BECAUSE WHEN JIMMY CALLED ZENDAYA TOM’S GIRLFRIEND I-
Jacob should help the Philippines as they delay the showing here in the Philippines of the Spiderman till January 8.
Doctor Tan
THEY ALL SEEM SO HAPPY AND AAH IM CRYING NOW
Did he said “girlfriend”?!
jacob seems so happy🤍
OMG JIMMY SAYING “GIRLFRIEND” AND THEM JUST BEING LIKE NORMAL HAS ME CRYING. I LOVE THEM SO MUCH AAAH🥺
6:31 Jimmy just called Zendaya Tom's girlfriend
They all are so adorable!!!❤️❤️😭
im very happy to see tobey and andrew again
Zendaya is charismatic!
I just really love benedict, he's purely humble.
I found out so many british in hollywood big movie. They got big role tho dang
SPOILERS! THERE HAD 4 SPIDEY IN THE MOVIE.
I am always nervous when Tom is being interviewed, as if it was me.
Zendaya! in all her Interviews and appearances she's always so posed and confident so Adult, here she seem like she's having an outer body experience for the 1st time as a Kid, excitement of love and life; her genuinely feeling something she never felt before.  Hold your Balance Tom!  you keep the most important part of her.  Mental Health speaks to: The HEART of it ALL. Like-minded!
The way no on denied the "girlfriend" line, IT'S OFFICIAL PEOPLE!!!🥺🥺
Really love how Jimmy snuck in your girlfriend and no one flipped out
Is Benedict auditoning for a variant of Tony Stark? The guy looked so similar to Tony while wearing the glasses at the premiere
Benadryl Tennismatch, you are a BABE!
Tom with longer curly hair kind of makes him look like a young Tony Goldwin
Dinetbec cumstache
TIKTOK ARE FULL OF SPOILERS!
Get this to a lot of likes 😊😂
Did I just heard "girlfriend"
Love
They are all adorable!🥰👌🏼
Hate Jimmy! Hate him! He insults women like he did to Salma and Sofia. And he takes bad revenge. Like he did to Matt Damon. Poor personality
I came for spoilers Wtf is this????😒😒
I'm looking forward to seeing this film!
Give jimmy a girlfriend
Tom and Zendaya have such Chemistry. I really hope the press let them enjoy each other before giving them problems!
Yooo he says girlfriend
His eyes when he says "can we watch it again " Man a real cute gentleman
Doctor Strange you look like Mephisto
As a Filipino Jacob's is the luckiest, because here in the Philippines the movie will show in January 8, 2022
That bald kid got it into his contract he goes to all the talk show. He just seems so out of place.
Looks like Tom Holland borrowed a pair of Tom Cruises shoes.
I miss RDJ in this team 🙌🚶
Lmao Benedict saying they’re generation Z but actually Tom, Jacob and Zendaya are the last millennials
I saw the leaked scene and I am shocked
what a fantastic interview
so Yh, everyone is in it. Andrew saves MJ and Tobey and Andrew have a web fight hehe
jimmy just sneaking in the word girlfriend is so fricking cute omg
Guyss I'm cryingg😭😭😭
1 min silence to all the folks who said Tobey and Andrew aren't in the movie
All 3 were born in 1996 they are 25 years old. Is 1996 Gen Z? Doesn’t it start at 1997
im so toyed of loyinggg
I love them all so much!! I also love the way jimmy freely said that Z is Tommo's girlfriend and how they complinent Ben and how they show love and affection towards jacob everytimr he speaks. Oh God I love these 4 so much 😭
please uplaod in good quality at least 1080p ?
6:33 so zendya is tom hollands girlfriend friend he said face time your girlfriend irl
I love the fact that Jimmy is the first host to call Zendaya "Tom's girlfriend", like... no one had dared to do it yet, I'm so glad someone finally said it out loud haha
When will people realize that leaking is a very effective marketing strategy?
Jacob = Dwayne rock Jr.
Bentdick Cumsnatch looks strange.
Jimmy played the girlfriend comment right. He didn’t avoid the topic like other interviewers so it was nice to have it acknowledged but not shoved down your throat. I’m sure the beautiful young couple appreciated the move
They are so funny, i think Im in love with Doctor Strange
Bring everyone!
He wasn’t leaking stuff. It called marketing. They know what they are doing. More people talked about him leaking stuff then what he said. It’s all set up
I'M SO EXCITED CAUSE I'M GONNA WATCH THIS MOVIE TOMORROW I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SINCE SO LONG AND I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT NOW I'M GONNA WATCH IT!!!!!
Cringed Zendaya
Fan theory: Charlie Cox Daredevil will be in the main MCU but the "Hey Happy" CG scene may be Pete  swinging by Faveru in archive footage as Foggy Nelson in the Affleck DD/McGuire retroactive shared universe?
Next time tom holland,andrew garfield and tobey maguire interview lol
Zendaya looks stunning, they all do!!!🤩 W cast W couple 💜
Benedict is Tom's "watch dog" for secrets.
Movie begins immediately after FFH, Whole film resets the MCU Spider-man continuity, setting up a Spider-man v Venom movie, main spoilers are May dying, Venom, Tobey getting stabbed, MJ forgetting about Peter
4:31 they're so cute
We all know Benedict was there to prevent them spoiling the movie 😂
We are so proud on you Sir. Jacob Batalon, we are so excited to watch the Spiderman no way home,, congrats to all, godbless.
Tobey is the Original Spider-man Andrew is the Amazing Spider-man Tom is the best Spoiler-man
Give Zendaya something to eat…
I like how jimmy slipped the girlfriend in there lol
"you call your girlfriend" im screaming
im excited...i guess the old ones are more excited than the young one😂
Jimmy didn’t acknowledge Jacob when announcing them that kinda made me sad
I  love how jimmy was like we are gonna see a exclusive clip then ends the video 😂
oh god such a humble humble person Benedict is!!! ❤️
Love the fact that Jimmy slid in the word girlfriend while talking to Tom.
Jacob looks amazing
Jacob had the better seat than Benedict? What?
👌🏿🇭🇹⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Jimmy just said GF… and they just yea.., is that confirmation
I'm just trying to figure out what world has it. Because it doesn't come out till the 17th
GIRLFRIEND????
Tom Holland is like a little RDJ !!!
Jimmy called Zandaya Tom's girlfriend and neither of them even flinched.  So I guess it is public now?
6:30 "You facetime your girlfriend"... nobody say a thing. hahahaha
aww look at tom and zendaya at 4:33
zendaya looks like she's wearing ufos XD *.*
Don’t open internet damn spoiler already!!
Most anticipated movie? I'm thinking it might be the next Matrix film.
Jimmy said girlfriend and no hesitation 😍❤
I’ve never been more excited about a movie holy
I really cant wait to see this!
when jacob said "that's called filipino as hell" had me dying 😂💀💀💀
6:37 what did he sayeeeeee
ZMM on the ASX. 99% down. Sweet investment?
RAN on the ASX. 99% down. Sweet investment?
I thought he was going to say “the movie will begin and then it’ll end” 😂
I seriously got a tension when Tom started talking when he said there really a scene we shot with...... And I thought oh ohhhh spoiler incoming but then it gave me relief when it was nothing 😂😂
So Tom and Zendaya are confirmed BF/GF?
Wow....I watch this show very often...but never seen these many likes in very short time.
Not liking the way Benedict has been slated to the top row
I can see Benedict just shutting down his phone because some mfs have leaked the movie on Youtube from the premiere.
I love Zendaya and Tom Holland.
Jimmy needs to up his interviewing game. He's not good anymore
LOVING Zendayas mummy-chic look! Stunning as always! 🤍
Tom's contract is up? WTF I thought the Sony extension allowed Spiderman 1 more team up movie. Tom you better be in avengers 5
he was a sk8erboi, she said see you l8r boy.  he wasn't good enough for herrrrr
i love jacob's positive energy
I Can't Freaking Wait Till This Weekend, But ...5:52 Did Someone Cut The Cheese?!🤔👀💨😜❤️
Cumberbatch is being genuine. He literally has not seen any scenes he's not in.
Spiderman releases on the PH on january so i gotta settle for thesw interviews
I clicked on the video coz I’m a big Benedict Cumberbatch fan and Ben just nailed it. He let the kids have the spotlight, just sat in a corner like a proud parent. What a gem.
not me waiting for tom to slip up
Wait it won’t be streaming at all? During a pandemic???? Why 😩
I was crying when Tobey Spiderman died 😢 😭 💔
Sherlock season 5!!
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Observed Tom Holland & Zendaya’s body language in their including both Benedict Cumberbatch and Jacob Batalon in their “circle” of conversation. Good on you both..
I like Jacob in the movies but outside is like really boring for me to watch him in interviews.  I wish it was otherwise.
Jimmy saying girlfriend 😭
Benedict Cumberbatch ❤️ amazing actor and is so humble.
Bella Thorn needs to be there to shake it up!!!
Why Zendaya always dress like she's going to a council meeting in the year 2525?
They should’ve had the bald dude laugh like that in the movies
Seeing the people in the audience wearing masks is reminiscent to watching the series of The Handmaid's Tale whereby the handmaid's are required to have their mouths covered at all times. It's been nearly two years now since COVID became apparent. Are we any nearer to returning to a degree of 'normality'?
Feeling bad for Jacob Batalon, he was not informed about the dress code.
Zendaya loves Tom so much lol it's sweet
Listen y’all not to hate but what the heck is zendeya wearing? She look like an angel mummy bruh
when jimmy said, girlfriend they didn't deny it
andrew and tobey are under the table
After the premiere, Jimmy should do and interview with Tom, Andrew and Tobey
him saying "your girlfriend" omgggg love it
Wait the way Jacob is saying u guys really makes me think about could Zendaya and Tom have been with each other from the beginning
He said girlfriend
Looks like Zendaya stole Rufus Shinra's coat  😂😂😂
Zendaya is so pretty!
That suit Benedict is wearing is a terrible thing to do to fashions.
What if I told you aunt may dies, Toby and Andrew ARE in it and Andrew saves MJ to make up for not being able to save Gwen. AND THERE IS CARNAGE (because venom shows up and drops something in their reality which causes a chain reaction)
Late show official
WTF is she wearing? Did she audition for The Mummy right before the show and took the costume with her or something? LOL!😂
Didn’t Jacob lose a lot of weight? I saw an Instagram post of his n he was rlly skinny n fit. I’m just confused.
What was the clip????????
Spiderman is cool and all, but it's funny that this movie is being pitched as Zendaya's most anticipated movie of 2021 when Dune was released not long ago...
i loved hearing sm about jacob! hes actually rly funny!
kevin fiege watching this : 😅🥸
I usually don't pay any attention or care what a celebrity is wearing, but man, I love Zendaya's outfit.
Jacob please tell them dont delay spider man nwh ph thanks
Why im always waiting for tom to drop spoilers dhbddb
Man...what happened? Kimmel is actually doing a really good interview. Damn time do change.
I'm so hyped like...
♥️♥️♥️
Jacob cracking up when Jimmy said girlfriend 😂😂
There will be 3 spiders!
Benedict here just tryna make sure no one spoils anything.
otter
Shout to Ben and Tom, letting Zendaya have first chair on a Spiderman/Marvel promo.
Lol Jimmy casually leaking Tom and Zandaya being a couple there.
Contract over huh  🤔
Hearing the words “just calling your girlfriend-“ sobbing there so cute
It’s so weird hearing people say girlfriend and them NOT denying it
Hahaha let's go it spiderman comes out on Wednesday in Ireland
I had to pause the video out of shock when Jimmy just point blank said “girlfriend” lmao
I love it when Zendaya
That toilet paper suit, lawls
At @2:46 what Zendaya says actually hits, despite doing a full on press tour they can't discuss and talk about what I am assuming are major major stuff,  And once the movie releases and the audience knows and can relate, we can't get to know the bts, their reactions and stories, unless either of them does press for their next movie and only if the interviewer decides to ask,  What I wish they really would do is get together after 2-3 weeks and do an interview discussing it all!
6:33 ^ It feels like just yesterday they were on the show cause of FFH❗️🕷🕸
I like Tom Holland's spiderman accent better.
6:29 IT IS CONFIRMED AAAAA
Zendaya is stunning
Fake heros...we need real life hero in this times
Jimmy caught me off guard i had to play that again and again...girlfriend lol
I thought Jimmy was a fan but a fan would know the movie comes out on Wednesday. Not friday
i had to pause the video and mull over the fact jimmy called z toms girlfriend…just flat out like that. No remorse whatsoever
I have no idea who these people are...May God bless them
Love  zendaya' s out fit
First time seeing Benedict in this movies press
I'll just wait until it's on Disney Plus
So happy! Finally some questions asked to Jacob. I dont even really care about the other 3. I've heard them answer to many questions, so boring.
Anyone else catch the fact that Jacob said he was living with ‘them?’
I’m so excited for this movie
Benedict is all they say of him.  And all of them are pretty good
7:15 so cute 🤧❤️
of course we like him too
no Philippino
what role has benidict been doing to be SO tan
You can tell at 7:35 how much Jimmy's comment meant to Benedict it's really touching
there was this weird thing going on where we kind of knew tomdaya was a thing, and they knew that we knew, but nobody was acknowledging it but now jimmy just aired it out 😂
I see you Jimmy…I see you… finding a way to slip “girlfriend” in there so naturally.
If I was in the crowd I constantly be like TOM SEND ME THE MOVIE
Jimmy was the only interviewer to outright refer to Zendaya as Tom's girlfriend and I'm so here for this man's courage. 😂
“ these guys are gen z and im gen OLD”
The awkward laugh after the girlfriend comment,yeah let's just laugh it off, we're not talking about that here, moving on😂
THE WAY JIMMY JUST SLIPPED GIRLFRIEND IN THERE AND THEY DIDNT EVEN DENY IT
Jacob looks like he won a competition
I’m very nervous about this movie…the amount of hype surrounding it and I feel like a lot of people who are highly critical will say it is terrible if it isnt thee greatest MCU film ever.  ALSO REALLY NERVOUS BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING SUPER TRAGIC because tons of people have been complaining that MCU Peter doesn’t have the heartbreak like losing loved ones. Even though Tony was a father figure to him.
seeing it tomorrow literally shaking
THAT HAWAIIAN KID SHOULD NOT BE AN ACTOR WTF...
I wish I could look a quarter of cool as Benedict looks in a pink suit...
👶❤💌💌💟💜❤💟💞
Jimmy, I love your laughter  ❤❤😍😍
Zendaya wearing toilet paper and still looks amazing
No hate but Zendaya's coat looks like toilet paper-
Can I point out how nice is of Tom to seat all the way in the corner of the chair to not give his back to his co-stars?? ❤❤
definitely was shocked with the confidence jimmy had to refer to zendaya as tom’s ‘girlfriend’
Wait, where's Aunt May.... oh yeah... too soon...
I do like Z but idk bout her playing MJ 😐  didn't really like her on the 1st spiderman movie
♥️♥️♥️ i can't wait😍😍😍👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Ben is rocking the pink suit damnn
Love ‘em
Jimmy the best his in the world ❤😍
Didn't know Jacob was vegan, thats amazing 💗
OMFG! As a post production worker for way too long, I can feel the tension the post production crew must have been living under for the last 2 weeks or so!
sad to see the elite not have to wear a mask or distance but all the peasant audience has to wear that moist disgusting mask.
Tom should get drunk and call Bob Iger again to make the next Spider-Man
that hair amped tom up fr
Love them
Zandaya wearing a mistcloak
Didn’t deny their dating city boys up let’s go spider
This guy is Holand's stunt double He didn't spoil anything
where's Andrew ?? and Tobey at least now bring them movie is already released
UM JIMMY GIRLFRIEND- WAS THAT CONFIRMATION?!?!?!?!?
He just had to get the girlfriend part in 😂
Benedict's suit look dope, I wish I could go but finals week. El capitan theater I'm coming back!
cute
Holland cannot keep a secret.
(I have not seen the movie) but I’m curious as to if Tobey and Andrew will be interviewed about the movie
Benedict’s suit is giving me life.
He actually called Zendaya Tom’s girlfriend ☺️☺️
Jacob looks like he could be The Rock’s kid
These interviews would be so much better with Conan as the host
That’s what she is tho she’s his misses what’s wrong with Jimmy saying it
It looks like Benedict is there to drop off his kids for there night over.
I knew once I saw the thumbnail that Jimmy would go after the age difference.
Am I the only one who noticed that jimmy called Zendaya Tom’s girlfriend ??? My heart literally dropped
I love the fact that Jimmy said " you call up your girlfriend ... " and both Zendaya and Tom didn't say anything and just smiled cause they knew they couldn't hide it anymore.
Zendayas out fit giving me Doc Oct vibes😍🥰
Yes aunt may died, and doc oc is still good, yes Toby, and Andrew do appear. Ned uses magic, and in the end everyone forgets who Spider-Man is, all the rumors are true! There it’s done!
Zendaya almost dressed like the lizard! this woman understands the assignments
CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND
This guy is the worst interviewer ever man wtf
6:32 did Jimmy say GIRLFRIEND?!!
Not gonna lie, I think Jacob laughing like that is a hint that’s gonna be hobb goblin cuz that is such an evil laugh.
the way jimmy just slipped “girlfriend” in there
I love Benedict!! He's such a great actor and a person ❤
"Thanks, that's why?" Lol that made me laugh
As much as I don't like Kimmel, it could have been the worse Jimmy. Also, why did nearly all Hollywood come to you. I think a proper geek like Colbert would have far better questions and inquiries
What is she wearing? ? ? Why
Jacob laughing and you hear oh wow in it
My kids and my blonde wife love Spiderman very much.
Not Jimmy slyly slipping in the “Girlfriend” word when he talks about Zendaya and Tom Facetiming!!! 😏😂😍 Are they really, like ACTUALLY dating??!!! Cuz I’ve been confused about this!😅🤣🤦🏻‍♂️
I’m related to Benedict!
1. Jimmy  asks a question 2. Guests answer lovely/angry/gently/or in any other way 3. Jimmy laughing: "Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh Eh"
They are genuinely nice people. It's a joy to watch them. So happy for Tom and Zendaya. ❤ And YAY for mentioning veganism. 🥰
I mean they already acknowledged that they’re together so Jimmy saying ‘girlfriend’ isn’t a big deal 🤷‍♀️
2:59 and he did🤣😆
i forgot Benedict was british omg
I’ll never forget ever
Ned
I cant be the only one who think Zendaya  showed Tom her curly hair rutine and thats why toms hair look so nice and wavy
why am imagining tom holland's face will be like rick astley in the future?
Zendaya Coleman is such an egotistical person, she said the reason for removing her surname is because all of the greats only have a singular name. She is not one of the greats.
Bro Marvel must have taken classes for Tom so that he does not spoil anything
The movie premieres tomorrow for me. So damn excited
Damn they caked on Jacob’s face lol
How—HOW—is no one talking about what happened with Jimmy in the first few seconds? What’s he SAYING?? What WAS that???
Tom has stolen RDJ shoes
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq  Programmierer der Master K. I.
Are Tom and zendaya dating cause jimmy said Tom called his girlfriend after skiing with a bloody face
Jacobbb when jimmy Kimmel said your girlfriend hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
I really hope they work Jimmy in as Kraven in a future movie, even just a quick cameo as a variant or something.
your girlfrienddddd that was awkward
Omg, I can’t deal with Spidey talking British
"Benedict is one of the greatest actors in the world"  yeah i agree with that. that man can really act.
It still blows my mind that people can have a strong accent from their county of orgin and then act american and believe it 1000%
Love this interview
Ned is soaked in fame..
You know you made it when you get the front seats and Cumberpatch gets put in the back
I thought they were millenials
I always have been interested to visit America I hope one day I can meet some one from there and get invited to meet that beautiful country, receive love from Mozambique!
Wait!! ARE THEY DATING?????
tom's outfit colours really suit him
Where's aunt may?
I don’t know but Tom gets better with the years lol 😂 🥰🥰
Tom Holland is like my little brother I swear to God, he really doesn't know how to keep his mouth shut xD
I love benedict....he is one of those rare actors that are loved by all generation of people....he can act in a super serious role and also play a superhero role with ease.....but for me he will always be sherlock❤️
He actually mentioned Jacob this time while entering!!! During their ffh interview he mentioned everyone but him and a lot of people were upset, including me
Zendaya is lovely but to me MJ has red hair
Supes in the audience:  LETS GOOOOOO
He's rocking Timothee Chalamet hair.
“HEY YOU SEEM PRETTY CHILL”  HD EDITION
Kimmel and such a turs
Jacob is such a nice guy😭🔥
Jacob, stop touching your face, please.
Is that the Rock's son?
I like how Jimmy snuck in the girlfriend bit 🥴
am i the only one who noticed that jimmy said that zendaya was tom‘s gf when they were talking about tom going snowboarding and facetiming zendaya???
Anyone else thing Jacob sounds like trae rags 😭
Even if we all expect and know they are girlfriend and boyfriend they haven’t really publicly came out with the news.. jimmy just dropping the girlfriend word was kinda rude it’s like assuming someone is your wife or your sister when your out somewhere when they are not either and just a hooker you found on the corner because you didn’t want to show up alone!! Like how rude right 😂
is it first time confirming zendaya as girlfriend???....jacob was having nervous laugh..
When Tom mentioned his contract with Marvel/Sony was up, I wish Jimmy would have followed up on that and asked Tom if he would be back as Spider Man in other projects.
Wow that was smoothest way of confirming Tomdaya's relationship I've ever seen Jimmy 😂
Errr did Zendaya escape from Arkham Asylum?
Watching this movie at Wednesday tommorow and i just know this is going to feel like the longest 24 hours of my life.
Benedict being careful about tom again...
It's b******* if the OG Spider-Men aren't in it. That's the whole reason I wanted to see it.
Confirmed Andrew and Toby are in it
I love that they're including jacob batalon in all this. The kid is great in the movies.
i know there's 5 people on the stage but i can't get my eyes off zendaya
Everyone looks good, except Tom looks pasty. Gross.
Jacob! he's gonna be the Hobgoblin watch! with a huge role in the movie
Tobey and Andrew sitting backstage
What the hell is up with Tom Hollands accent!? He almost sounds Australian
Jimmy Kimmel in 720p is the best i can get :/
Call your girlfriend at 6:37 huh😏
Tom Holland,,🥰
Spiderman is the new iron man of the MCU.  TOM CHANGED IN TO RDJ 😂😂
When does this movie come out because I’ve heard so many different things. It’s Friday, it’s Thursday, and kümmel just said that TONIGHT(Tuesday) is the premiere
I love how Jimmy includes everyone in the interviews, most people would just focus on Tom and Zendaya
I love how Benedict was like these guys are gen z and I'm like no bro. They look they were Bron before 2000s. I am gen z bc I was born in 2001.
Tom's contract is up???!
6:34 GIrLfrIend nO denying now
I love these guys!! ❤
Why is Tom sounding more Australian day by day.
thanks Kimmel, this was a great interview. :)
So no one is gonna talk about how Tom is behaving exactly like RDJ during interviews. The stylish coat unbuttoning, the crossed legs... seriously... no one?
I’m obsessed with Zendaya’s outfit
i love jacob talking about his family and being filipino as hell 😂
oh no, his contract is up
I want to go to the new Spiderman movie so bad but I don't know who I can go with :(
too noight hehe
Although Zandaya looks fantastic.  Her outfit kinda looks like someone TP'd her house and she rushed out the front door....
Jacob being "Filipino as hell" 😂😂😂
I kinda love that Jimmy is really trying to include everyone, and you can see Tom is sitting in a way where he can see his co-stars and Jimmy which is so nice tbh.   -edit- Love how Jimmy said "typical of an actor instead of going to the doctor you facetime your girlfriend" I was like oh wow they didn't have a weird reaction they just laughed...damn lmao
JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA otro spoiler al decir que está cansado de mentir
In Norway we need to Wait to 14 Jan, thats some bullshit
Benedict's got a cold 🙈
cant believe jimmy said girlfriend and they all laughed
Love seeing brits taking over the American movie scene 🇬🇧
Wow, I don't watch a lot of Kimmel but this interview was such a surprise! Really good questions, the banter was also awesome!
OMG HE SAID CALL UR GIRLFRIEND
I didn’t Tom zendaya and Jacob lived together at one point. No wonder they’re so close
in latin america premieres tomorrow and i cant wait
Slightly awkward when Jimmy said girlfriend ngl
Just read Variety Review...it confirms Tobey & Andrew are in it.
How about Benedict being the new James Bond, thoughts anybody?
My dog watched this with me 😂
Girlfriend!!!!!! 👀👀
Jacob looks like a weird variant of the Rock from another Universe.
Tom Holland se escucha fake
Benedict stuck with the trio 😂
SEEING IT FRIDAY IM SO EXCITED
I love how Jimmy said "your girlfriend " with no hesitation ❤️🤗
Jimmy Fallon has a better show and better guest just my opinion
Zendaya is so pretty
Jimmy saying girl friend
Zendaya is dressed up as the Spider-Man multiverse villain, Toilet paper man
Jimmy just confirm Tom and zendaya are dating!
2:30, 6:30 “girlfriend”
nah its not worth it anymore to pay with money and time to watch such shitty movies the Industrie (the movies And the People) is going more and more disgusting that i rarely watch any movies nowaday
Bring in Andrew and Tobey,think they too deserve to be in interviews 😂
BENEDICT!! LOOKING GOOD 😊😊🥰🥰🥰🥰
I’m just saying that I will come back to this interview after I see the film because I am avoiding as many spoilers as physically possible! Lol
0:25 Tom did that blazer unlock thing which RDJ does, boy do I miss them.
When Jimmy said "Girlfriend", i scream.
None of those kids are gen z
I love Benedict Cucumber so much
THERE ARE THREE SPIDERMEN IN THE MOVIE!
benedict "imma spend some time with my family no more sherlock, whores"  cumberbatch
Benedict got emotional when Jimmy said that Benedict is one of the best actors in the world. 😪❤️
Zendaya flashed the red bottoms 👠 and I died
I'm only going to watch the movie Thursday so I am running from spoilers
"Call your girlfriend" wow yeah don't be shine Tom say that too
Zendaya wearing that partially-shredded Banksy auction piece.
Zendaya and Tom Holland are dating? Didn't know that.
When he said YOUR GIRLFRIEND i think i died a little
Like it if you r watching for spoilers
This is not real Tom Holland, Its a CGI version of him !!
Thank goodness that Jimmy knows how to steer around the questions to everyone, instead of very specific questions geared to one person.
Spoiler: I just checked Wikipedia and if you check the cast you’ll see both Andrew and Toby  are part of it…
Glad everyone was included in this interview and not just the two at front.
I have never wanted something to remain private lol when Jimmy said “girlfriend” i was like 😲 its still a secret 😭😭(private obviously since the actors haven’t come out I believe we should let them have privacy)
So apparantely marvel used blue screen this…….just like the blue screen in the leaked pics of tobey and andrew?
I like how Zendaya wore a superhero costume to the interview.
When he said girlfriend Tom and Zendaya just laughed it off 😏
Why is Benedict orange?
"FaceTime your girlfriend" me: 😳 he-he said it
I'm surprised that Jimmy said "you call ur girlfriend"
so zendaya din't denied when jimmy says she's tom girlfriend ?
HE SAID YOU CALL YOUR GIRLFRIEND LMAOO
See how red benedict is looking. I think this means he is also Mephisto  :O
Whyd jacob randomly mention his family going to a vegan restaurant out of nowhere
I just noticed Jacob lost a ton of weight
Benedict looks like a father there with his son (Tom), the son's girlfriend (Zendaya) and the son's bestfriend (Jacob) 💀
Benedict Cumberbatch looks like the cool uncle in charge of the kids for the week
Jacob is so sweet abut his family, I can't!
Neither of them denied it when Jimmy called Zendaya his girlfriend at 6:34 😌
Zendaya taking a picture of Benedict on the skateboard is so adorable 😍
When do actors and producers etc watch it
No one denied when he said girlfriend
Kenedictbumberbatch
Jacob Batalon Filipino represent 🔥🇵🇭
Sherlock Holmes is awesome 🔥🔥
Kimmel is annoying
I love how Jimmy just slipped in there that he facetimed his girlfriend.  And no one denied it.
Is tom wearing zendaya's suit from the Graham Norton show??
Not Jimmy exposing that they are bf and gf
Zendaya's bringing a lot male teenagers to theatre
3:01 C’mon they’re in the movie
Girlfriend!!! Woohoo!!! Someone said it! Thanks Jimmy!
Wikipedia confirms 3 Spidermans in the film! Yay!
Zendaya looks Fab!!
Jimmy, I'm 64 and I'm just as excited as you!!  I grew up reading all the Marvel and DC comics, Marvel was always my favorite!! I still have some comic books from the 60s, I'm giving them to my grandson who is into editing and animation when I'm no longer on this earth!! I can't wait to watch this movie!!
I loved when Jimmy called Zendaya, Tom's girlfriend 🥺🥺❤
For me Tobey is the best spider man till today
Wait, Jimmy is 54?!?! 😮😮
0:25 Tom holland imitating RDJ's move with unbuttoning the suit😆
Come on spidey ...spoil....😂
Spidey, spidey
Zendaya's fashion sense is amazing, it even matches the movie she is part of
Jacob Batalon, CEO of Sex
Jimmy saying Girlfriend>>>
Zendaya was in Dune and No Way Home in the same year 😩 and she still gets nervous
I love you Benedict
tomorrow is so excited!!!!!!!!
Damn, the interview was good, but can't help to notice tho, Jimmy's laugh sounds like squidward from SpongeBob haha
2022 is going to have "amazing" movies ;)
Is it more or does Tom sound more British recently?
Awesome interview but I wanted to see that never before seen clip from Spider-Man 🥺
i see only one actor there (Cumberbutcher)... everybody else is there just cuz instagram is a thing
Zendaya always brings the SLAY!  Kudos to all the cast; but I have to tell the truth and shame the devil. Mr. Cumberbatch... you're looking like a straight up *P.I.M.P.* in that suit and I mean in a classy, English, super SEXY, super-HOT way! 💜👀😋 🙌
I have a feeling this is the post credit scene in No way home.
Lmao Jimmy says “girlfriend” and just like that it’s official
Lovely words by Benedict about his fellow castmates.
6:33 did Jimmy just call Zendaya Tom's girlfriend?   I love this 😌
Wikipedia updated the Spiderman: No Way Home cast by adding Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield and noting that they are reprising their roles from their previous alternate versions.. that's an ultra Spoiler for us. We kinda knew it was coming but it felt more real when wiki is already the one who's telling us. They updated it before the film was world wide out. since I found that out, I'll spoil you guys so you can feel my pain of getting spoiled(even though I kinda knew they were coming.)
Tom is like a mini Robert D J
Hehe Lucky me gonna see the film on December 16
I can't wait to see this movie tomorrow
"Why you haven't seen it?" "Because I'm exited to see it" *Intelligence 100* *Speech 100* *Excitement 1000*
"When you call your girlfriend" ---- THEY'RE OFFICIAL6:36
i don't know who did the makeup on those two back there but ... yeah... lol
3:44 what did Jacob say?
Jimmy saying girlfriend all loud and I'm like "dude, have some chill!" 😄
benedict on a babysitting duty again lmao
I genuinely hope Tom and Zendaya stay together for a really long time and don't break up. Bc I was really upset when Emma stone and Andrew Garfield were together and then broke up :(. So crossing my fingers 🤞
This is an awesome interview exclusive live   It is lowkey breaking racism, look how different they are even the way they talk.  So nice, so so so nice to see
Jimmy saying to Tom “calling your girlfriend” in the most normal way while the whole press tour some interviews are trying to sneak questions to get some sort of a confirmation about their relationships. Only Jimmy was given the authorization. Good one!
I hate jimmy’s spoon fed pre approved question every time he has a guest.
Tom's going full classy like RDJ
Meanwhile, back in realityland...
Damn the heels on toms shoes
CANT BELIEVE WE ARE HERE!!
I can't not look at Tom and see Tony Goldwyn. Can't wait to see the film.
I liked how it looks likes benedict went to shake guillermo's hand when he came in
How come Tom Holland hasn't spilled the spoilers for this movie yet?
why does Tom Holland have more makeup on than zendaya
Jacobs nervous laugh when kimmel called referred to zendaya as toms girlfriend was so funny
Benedict is such a gentleman. Love him ❤️
“They’re gen z and I’m gen old.” Shush Ben. I am literally five weeks to the day older than you. We are not old.
He mispronounced Zendaya’s name
I’m now just here for Zendayas wardrobe!
The rock the Dwayne Johnson looks lit in glasses 🤓
Jacob looks like a mini The Rock
0:58 Tom Holland Looks like Tom Hiddleston ngl
***SPOILER ALERT***                  Spiderman No Way Home is FILM OF THE YEAR ALREADY
Awww Jacob.
at the start jimmy kimmel was saying everyone who is coming today on the show, they didn't even hear Jacobs name but still got excited
3:00 he only needed to wait one more just one more day
Most boring Spider Man cast ever.
What is she wearing it's like someone put her outfit in the shredder
I absolutely hate when they stack more than two guests at once. It is a cluster of a shitty time where nobody gets a chance to talk honestly.
My heart stopped @7:16 u have no idea
3:38 laughing at how jacob says he brings 8 people in the premier because that's a filipino thing hahshs true af, as a filipino I can confirmed this, filipino always gathered together
6:10 everybody is talking about jimmy calling her his girlfriend but my heart sank a bit when he said his contract is up! Does that mean this is Tom's last movie as spiderman?! I don't think I can take another change in the actor playing spiderman!!! 😅
Jacob is awesome
AHHHHH BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH WITH THE FACE HAIR!! ❤️
is there anyone from LA who can spoil anything?
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
they didn’t correct him when he said girlfriend sooo 6:33
Ok but zendaya is just so fine….
You didn't ask a million dollor question....
Jacob did namaste while entry
Like only for my doctor , doctor strange 🧙‍♂️
Zendaya channeling her inner Macho Man Randy Savage with that outfit! DIG IT!!
Where’s Marisa?
What's up with Tom's eyebrow?
Necesito verla yaaaaa, no puedo más!
I love how Jimmy said girlfriend and they didn’t say anything about it
My teenage dream is now orange lmao
It's just so funny how Tom mixed up some RDJ habits into his style. I can see the mentor student relationship between them clearly
I absolutely love Benedict
I’m so glad Jacob got lots to talk about this interview!!!
not zendaya´s outfit literally stealing my breath away
Beautiful ensemble, Zendaya
The way he snuck girlfriend in there 😂
Why aren't they wearing masks?
Naughty  jimmy.😊 u kept  trying to get Tom to give a spoiler. Sooo painful  watching Tom dance through. 🤣🤣🤣
TOBEY DIES HAPPY DIES AND NED GETS STUCK IN THE MULTIVERSE HAHAGAGA U GOT SPOILEDDDD🖕🖕🖕🖕
Though they didn’t mind about this and Tom&zendaya are the top 2 of the movie, I'm still a bit irritated by seeing Benedict being seated behind .he's more senior and respectfull right?
That was a good one 🤣
Why is Zendaya wearing a bunch of toilet paper over her dress?
Tom is growing not spoiling anything... Wow
Girlfriend?
I love every one of them so much, but I can’t take my eyes off of Benedict, he’s so handsome in that suit!!!
Jimmy is literally us, he said it directly "girlfriend" like we all wanted to say it 😂 finally Edit : time stamp 6:33
So that's Tom's real voice! First time hearing it! 😊
He learn something. Tom Holland hasn't leaked anything about No Way Home. Good job. @sabio28
Is this the Rocks new born?
Yeaaay...Benedict has been practicing making heart fingers! ❤
HAHHA jimmy just saying girlfriend with no regrets is so funny agreed!
I love Zendaya, she's so sweet, a great dancer and talented actress...but what is up with that outfit?  It looks like a mummy unraveling!
Andrew Garfield 😭❤❤❤
Jacob's ring though wow and Benedict's tan
Was this the first time Zendaya was reffered to as Tom's gf or did I miss something ?
Has Zendeya been teepeed?
All filipinos excited for this movie🥰
Man Benedict Cumberbatch has close to zero ego. He doesn't mind not being the centre of attention for this movie inspite of being, to quote Jimmy, "one of the greatest actors in the world". And he genuinely complimented Tomdaya and Jacob. No wonder y'all love him so much
confirmed tobey and andrew are back bitches
Why am I watching this feeling so nervous about if there will be a spoiler x
Awwww they’re just a bunch of kind humans 🥺❤️ I love them all!
She's lame
Where has benedict been all this time during promos?
So if Tom contact up we not seeing him in doctor strange 2 😭
They didn’t even deny it 😂😂
Hahahahha Tom opening his jacket is a full on rdj move
BENEDICT STRAAAANGEEEEE  I really would like to see him taking on peter's father/mentor/older brother mental in the movie now that tony is gone - it would especially make sense as they 3 were so together mostly in his last times.... and also may be be jealous of (lets say) Doc ock (or anyone else who makes more sense) for getting close to peter.
Zendaya says Tom is her favorite Spiderman  Tobey: I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye
And here I am... still waiting for the clip he mentioned.
Now, Zendaya....She's an ICON🌟
Really love how Jacob is just vibing the whole time. He’s such an underrated person and plays such an underrated character, people should know and love him more!
I thought that Jacob lost lot of weight..
Benedict coming back to babysit Tom one more time gives me joy 😊
Jacob Batalon looks like a make a wish kid
I can't wait for the movie.....
I not even gonna ask what zendaya is wearing
FIY, I'm 31 and I just let out a squel of joy when Kimmel called Zendaya Tom's girlfriend.
Zendaya is a great actress, I guess, but she’s a horrible MJ (her name isn’t even Mary Jane).
Zendaya foi a Mary Jane mais FEIA do cinema. Deviam ter escolhido outra.
am i the only one who thinks benedict should have been seated at the couch and zendaya on the chair ? he is so senior to all the other actors just out of respect he should have been seated at the couch.
Tom Holland is obviously good-looking but this time around he’s more grown up and it looks good on him.
Spiderman to save the future. By Stan Lee. Damgs..   Kid tok distracted by the girl. ..
Can we Make...  The scientist come together.. Before the powered characters
Damn, for a British guy, Benedict cumberbatch is tanned
Is this spoiler free interview?
I wonder when ben is gonna film Sherlock again. If it could  be in Victorian era that would be even more stimulating.
I have the same jacket with Jacob sheesh. 20 euros from H&M and very nice. My boy knows how to dress!!
I just want to know if they're in it, that's it - someone tell me please!!! Also, Benedict doing reshoots for Doctor Strange 2 hopefully isn't a reason for us to get worried and it makes the movie better, like they did for Rogue One!
Jimmy is so sly... 😅
I see what Jimmy did there, he snuck in that  "girlfriend"
"I don't have to lie anymore" oh Tom 😂😂😂
Yo 720P shouldn't be your best quality on youtube.....cm'on man!
When the movie company also owns a TV network, getting multiple stars at the same time to promote your movie is easy!
It seems Jacob has lost some weight
Jimmy to Tom: 6:33min *instead  of the Hospital you call your girlfriend …😍😍* Screaming  THATS a confirm
Can someone make an edit of when jimmy says girlfriend. Doctor strange says that feels weird but I'll allow it.
sam raimi spider man movies was the best superhero trilogy and no way home is surprising becuase of his spidey
Zendaya's outfit is a lot like the one she wore for the interview of "far from home". 😍
This is the best interview of the press  tour! ❤️
When Jimmy said “girlfriend” I was like “YESSS”
Benedict sitting there ready to jump anytime Tom is going to spill too much
I can see Zendaya and Tom really have ❤️‍🔥 and passion for one another 🔥
6:33 did he say girlfriend?? 😂😂
Nothing happens:  Crowd: WOOO LETS GO
Jacob's laugh just confirmed he'll become hobgoblin
Is it just me or Tom's outfit is somewhat similar to what zendaya wore on another show?!
Last time I seen a head like Ned’s I was pissing out of it….
Tom Holland is quite posh, but maybe that's because he has a lot of pounds now!
Jimmy just threw the word GIRLFRIEND and he knew what he was doing
"Instead of going to the doctors, you just phone calling your girlfriend saying you're covered in blood..." and no objection whatsoever :)))
benny looks so different
DID JIMMY JUST CONFIRMED THEIR RELATIONSHIP?
3:44 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭✌🏻
Benedict still on TomWatch 😅😂
HE SAY GIRLFRIENDDDDD YALLL HEEE SSAY GIRLFRIEND KJWECNLK
Omg tom saw it and hasnt been spoiling much?! Growing up lol
Entendí mal o Tom dijo q esta cansado de las mentiras...entonces si estan sus antecesores en la peli...genial!!
How much Tom admires and looks after Mr. Ironman RDJ, we can see every time when he enters, open his coat button.
HE CALLED HER HIS GIRLFRIEND!!!!!!!!! I'm crying
Can’t wait to see this. Avoiding spoilers is going to be almost impossible.
*Spider-Boy segments featuring Tom Holland should be "Shorts" up to 20 minutes long.*
The fact he actually called Zendaya toms girlfriend made me really shocked lol
jimmy is so slick adding 'girlfriend' - it caught them off guard lol
DID JIMMY JUST SAY GIRLFRIEND?!
I was just chillin in my bed watching this and when jimmy said “your girlfriend” I was like “woah woah woah girlfriend?” That’s the first time I heard someone call Z toms girlfriend
disagree I rather see it   alone than have to listen to babies cry and people talk
Now a filipino is a Part of MCU 😅 (Jacob)
I'm sure I'm not first to make this comment but Zendaya's outfit is very, very cool she could be a younger (much younger) female Steve Tyler
Benedict has my heart ❤️
At this point I think Marvel have released a red herring trailer and behind all the scheming, Tobey and Andrew will actually be in the movie as a surprise, imagine how epic that'll be.
Benedict Cumberbatch voice is 🔥🔥
Yes, he really looks cool😎 with bloody face and cuteness 🥺comes out .👏👏👏👏
Zendaya Tom are official
Great.
I absolutely love how humble Benedict Cumberbatch is he is amazing
Benedict looks like Breach from Valorant and Ibrahimovic.
1:55 , what was that? A fart?
He dropped the g word 😱 My jaw literally dropped! I'm glad they're more comfortable and open about it though. They're perfect together! Great interview, making everyone feel included 👏🏻
I love how they don't just focus on Tom Holland cuz he is Spider-man they include Zendaya and Jacob in alot of other interviews
Every time I watch Jimmy Kimmel I’m reminded why I don’t like Jimmy Kimmel
He called Zendeya Tom's Girlfriend 😂😂😂😂😂
Benedict feeling uncomfortable after being called 'oone of the greatest actors in the world' is so Benedict
I DIDN'T NOT SEE THE MOVIE YET, BUT FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, IT WAS GREAT AND YOU ALL WERE VERY PLEASED AM I RIGHT?👤
Ben Cumberbatch chaperoning the youngsters...
That Goblin suit needs to be worn by both Tom & Zendaya at the same timee like omg
where is 1080p?
Did Jimmy said GIRLFRIENDDDD!?? 😮
Zendaya is so in demand, I saw her in a lot of poster and promotions
Woow Tom Holland you. Are doing good 😂👍🤗😍❤️🤩
Tom Holland ❤️😍🤩✨💫
❤️❤️😍😍🤩🤩
It's Jimmy unapologetically referring to Zendaya as Tom's girlfriend for me. Haha 😂
yeheyy hiiii hellllooo
I’ve only liked this video because of Jacob, Benedict, Zendaya  and Tom  Not because of you Jimmy
Loool, that offhand “girlfriend” comment hit me in the chest 😂
Benedict no longer needs to babysit tom for spoilers
Is calling Zendaya Tom's gf a spoiler? For me yes. I mean I read it in a mag but it's confirmed here.
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
🤘🥰😇
Love them omg
7:70 Tom doing a great job not answering the question. His media training and experience on media tours paying off.
6:33 girlfriend , huh?
Go Jacob!   Filipino here
Do you just randomly ask yourself how each single one of them is really comfortable talking and joking on television & in front of live audience?? Not even the tips of their fingers are tense & they set pretty comfortably especially zendaya  Like I’m really nervous if I talk to even 1 person???
I've been so addicted to No Way Home related videos. I even made a whole video essay talking about all the previous Spider-Men movies. Thursday can't come soon enough
🙌
Tom Zendeya Jacob are all 25 years old. Born the same year!!!!
Why am I so stocked that he said girlfriend lmaoo
Tom did that  Robert thing again❤️
it just feels like ben is there to supervise them
I’d love having Jacob as a friend he seems like so down to earth and also is naturally funny!
Tom and Benedict matching suits :D
Bringing a lot of family because you're Filipino as hell 😂 Sometimes I forget that Jacob is Filipino. And I laugh when I get reminded cause my friend kinda looks like him 😁
So Jimmy the evil genius just slips in the gf question and no one reacts... Wow
omfg jimmy dropped the g word! that literally had me shook even though the whole world knows they're together lol
Benedict Cumberbatch needs a onewheel
Jacob batalon and zendaya can just... Disappear?  I mean, they only distract
Best moment was at 4:32..!!!
6:34 jacob is all of us
GIRLFRIEND
I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE AT ALL 2 DAYS AWAY
they seem like really good mates, they all have great chemistry.
just watched premiere i’m so glad they actually did have the old spidermen the movie was amazing
Benedict Cumberbatch
UK gang tomorrow. I'm so excited.
Skater Doctor Strange
The older that Benedict gets the more handsome he seems to get in my eyes, and that's just amazing. I love that guy! Also Tom and Zendaya, love them immensely, so I am super excited to see the three of them sharing screen time together! And of course, I can't leave out Jacob, who is great as Ned. Love them all, and I can't wait till Friday!!
How funny.
baes
This was actually a really good interview. Everyone got to talk. I think it was a good decision to place TH further away from the host because it helps in not feeling like every question is just directed at him.
Who else is fan of Benedict 💯
ZENDAYA ALWAYS AMAZE US WITH HER OUTFITS,DAMN GURLLLL......
Ik Tom holland is right there,,but Benedict is my forever bae
Benedict Cumberbatch, Robert Downey Jr, and Hugh Laurie should make a movie (after RDJ makes the third Sherlock Holmes ofc) 🙌🏻🙌🏻
6:05 SPOILERRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love how that chubby dude is rocking H&M jacket , i bought same one for like 25$ or so and that’s best jacket i’ve ever bought
zendaya always lookin FLY AF!!
Ned's wig looks great in the movie
This newer spiderman saga is the worst
Girlfriend?!!!!
Where’s Donovan Mitchell?
I'm just glad that Mark Ruffalo didn't have his camera recording this time lol
She's a charmer although I don't quite get the toilet paper outfit. Please advise. Am I out of date, fashionwise?
i have to wait for more days in australia :_:
God bless Kimmel, he's usually an awful interviewer, but he was absolutely SPOT-ON when he insisted that Cumberbatch is on another level, acting-wise, compared to the three younger folks.
I tried skating as an adult....and it so not so easy.
Benedict, taking the kids to see Uncle Jimmy
4:27-4:29, best line
this whole time I didn’t know Jacob was from my country smh
Just Jimmy subtly referring to Zendaya and Tom's girlfriend... this is great
2:22-2:34, perfect didn't spoiled too less didn't spoiled too much
I love how much Tom Holland is like his dad. Has the same delivery and cadence. Its weird how Dom Holland was a relatively big standup in the 90s, but his son is like the biggest actor in the world....he must be so proud of his son.
6:49 and then my heart melted. What a great group of people.
Jimmy - 'your girlfriend' Tom and Zendaya - what!! "Lets try to play it cool" Zen's laugh tells the awkwardness
"Hey Happy" is my fav ❤️
Tom looking super classy like Ben
Sana nabanggit ni Batalon January 8 pa ipalalabas sa Pilipinas movie na 'yan.
Someone link me to that plaid flannel shirt that Ned is wearing!!  I can’t find it using google image search lol
the most partisipated movie ?!?!? really ?!?!? ammm DUNE ????????? THE MATRIX ???? and anything that is not crap
😍😍😍
exclusively on Friday excuse me i watching it on Thursday sheeesh quick flex
Someone is having Dune vibes in their dressing style 🤣
When Benedict was talking about looking up to the kids I think he was just talking about Tom and Zendeya
Zendaya, tom and benedict giving me bi-panic🥵🥵
Hate that "superheros" are on a show where the host joked about not treating someone because of the vaccine status. 🤮
love when zendaya wears her curls
Tom Holland gave away that he says “hey happy”
Filipino is hell because we are about to watch it next year XD
benedict praising the cast😩
Jimmy really went there when he brought up the girlfriend remark. Straight savagery
I genuinely love Benedict
Benedict Cumberbatch is having a good year! He’ll definitely get an Oscars nomination for the Power of the Dog for Best Actor.
2:22 Benedict’s quick flash of fear wondering if he needed to quickly jump over and muffle Tom 😂😂
Jimmy Kimmel referencing Zendaya as Tom’s girlfriend and NOBODY correcting him is all the confirmation I need😭🙌
"your girlfriend" 😭😭
Yep already confirmed, Tobey and Andrew were there........watching the movie together!
Crossroads shoutout. Love this cast. Can’t wait for the movie!!!! Epic team.
Tom Holland slowly becomes Robert more and more everyday
3:00 woooopsie xD. He's not giving any spoilers with that but yet, he spoilers something with that xD.
Filipinos!!!
Can’t wait to see it tomorrow, can’t believe we get it 2 days early in the UK!
botak
Was I the only one shocked when jimmy said your “girlfriend” ?!?!
I'm a old cumberbitch.
6:33 They really tried to play it off huh lmaoo
You can definitely push veganism on everyone
Hyped for this movie!
Love you Benedict
finally benedict appeared in spiderman interview
Zendaya's Electro-inspired look!! ⚡ She and her team are incredible 🤩
Could anyone else feel the tension when Jimmy said girlfriend or was it just me lmao
6:33 is the most important part of this interview. You're welcome.
OMG Jimmy spilling secrets 6:30  HE SHIPS ZENDAYA AND TOM
had to pause when jimmy when jimmy said girlfriend WOOAH
Alright so..... why is zendaya wearing toilet paper for clothing?
Those heels look painful ouch
wow.. the ring he is holding below his face....
Jacob is so cool! I love his vibe.
Jimmy Kimmel is so sneaky I love it, buttering them up and then hitting them with the GF line, honestly this is the most comfortable I’ve seen the cast in interviews
She needs a cheeseburger or 3..
Not Tom slipping up the last second 💀🤣🤣🤣
Lmao I really had to backup just to see if Jimmy really did say "girlfriend"
Girlfriend 🙄
😮
Loveeeee
Kimmel must be high…it’s far from home!
I'm sure Tom prepared atleast 20 times to not spoil anything before this interview
2:59 jacob spoiled 🤣
So proud of Jacob and his Filipino roots!
I CANT WAIT TIL WE START GETTING INTERVIEWS WITH TOBEY & ANDREW 😱💯
7:36 yes sir, you have earned this title!
Now for the new marvel movie  dead horseman...he is just a dead horse being beaten on.
Yay Tobey Maguire
Why is Ned bald?
Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the greatest Actors in the world. Audience's immediate reactions to that true statement by Jimmy were telling it all.
I think Zendaya is gorgeous but still looks like a teenager dressed like a grown up.
Heyyyy Jacob Filipino hereeeeee live u dude I’m so proud of you and you’re living a dream
Zendaya looks like she walked through a paper shredder with that outfit
Anybody else panick so hard when he said girlfriend??
Didn't know the rock had a lil bro
Ben is soo humble 🥺
Ooooh so Tom and Zendaya been living together for filming since the 1st movie!
“These guys are gen z and I’m gen old” typical dad joke, I love it lmaooooo
i love jacob
Who else is in the comments after jimmy said girlfriend
NO Venom, Falcon, Scorpion, Vulture, or Hulk. No real surprise MCU cameos Aunt May gets killed by Green Goblin. Ned, Happy, and MJ are all there Doctor Strange appears throughout the film. His role is not big. Doctor Octopus ends up helping the good guys. Electro gets defeated by Octavius. Aunt May says "With great power comes great responsibility" In the end, the villains actually get sent back reformed and they don't die in battle.
First time someone has said girlfriend, I repeated that about 10 times lmao
I think Zendaya had a problem in the bathroom!
Could you imagine the premiere happens and it's actually a Deadpool movie being released
Bruh, Jacobs fam is so lucky, we have to wait till jan 8 in PH
Jimmy calling Zendaya girlfriend with no regrets whatsoever 😂😂
green goblin kills aunt may non of the villains die at the end , they all get cured andrew saves MJ from falling everyone forgets tom holland is spiderman at the end
Is it me or Jimmy is the first person who called Zendaya "a girlfriend " publicly in front of Tomdaya???
Yo that dude is so skinny now
I’m surprised Tom Holland hasn’t leaked anything about No Way Home yet. Major growth from him 😂
love them sm<3
Everyone is looking amazing here! I can't wait to see No Way Home
Jacob reppin Filipinos 😭💕
Benedict Cumbertan.  You’re welcome.
Tom just forgot to spoil 🤣
NO ONE TALKING ABOUT JIMMY CALLED ZENDAYA TOMS GIRLFRIEND AND NEITHER OF THEM DENIED IT?!??!?!
War Machine vs Falcon
Why zendaya wore toilet paper
i guess mcu set tom and zendaya up so tom has a girlfriend to talk to and he doesn't spoil their movies anymore and also his girlfriend can't spoil the movies.
Spider-Man vs hawkeye
Broo is  no one gonna mentioned that he called them girlfriend & boyfriend and they didn't say anything
6:35 ...... What did Jimmy just do 🙂
AQUAMAN DIES IN NO WAY HOME
Oh dear, too old for this hehe, haha, so funny, so cute... I prefer something a bit more serious.
SPOILERS:     -Andrew And Tobey are in the movie -Aunt May dies
People wanna watch this movie because of tobey and andrew if they dont show up it will be a big disapointment.
GIRLFRIEND?? 😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
Finally someone who was nt afraid to say it confidently girlfriend 😍 if u ddnt knw nw you do we have a power couple here
Finally two of my favorite babies together ❤️ ❤️ Tom and Ben 🥰
Tom had a gun held to his head during this interview
Zendaya out there looking like a mummy 😂
John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life🥰❤
Learned from RDJ….learned from benedict…..can tom holland just play watson already?! Lol
Man imagine all the money they're saving not paying andrew garfield and tobey to promote this
nobody's gonna mention Jimmy calling zendaya tom's girlfriend without hesitation and getting away w it???? aaaaah
They were going nuts ! Lol they like tom! I'm like zendaya 🥴
jimmy just said facetimed your girlfriend and tom just nodded nice
And, I agree. Zendaya is a beauty.
I was so confused as to why Benedict wasn’t on this press tour, too… since he’s literally on all the zoom backdrops and went around with Tom on the EndGame tour. But, yeah. Doctor Strange reshoots make a lot of sense as to why.
He did not just say girlfriend so casually omg! Even they were shook low key 😅
Benedict Cumberbatch,the man of elegance…
Tom talking .... Benedict ,Zendaya , Jacob looking at him ..... All of them be like ahhhhhh spoiler here we go again
Jimmy and Benedict need a Comedy Show Together lol
Tom Holland is classy.
benedict must feel weird rolling with these under-30's
That is the most comfortable ive seen Zendaya in an interview 🖤 so happy for her
I like how Tom Holland has two inches added to the bottom of his shoes!!!!!!
I love how Jimmy's saying girlfriend unprovoked!
Are they dating for real? 😳
I love how it forget their Englishmen
YOUR GIRLFRIEND yes WHAT finally
fact: they all work well together
We know there is more stars are coming 😁
jacob i hope you can temporarily give up veganism if you make it back to koreanenglishman you were so great in those chicken videos
Jimmy Kimmel's Interviewer Skills: Benedict, you are 20 years older than these guys
So Good
Oh poor Jimmy, trying so hard to get something out of the movie before it's release 😂😂
It's great seeing Benjamin joining the kids for these interviews.
I was in a total shock when Jimmy just blurted out the word girlfriend 😳
Zendaya's outfit is awesome 👌 👏 👍.  They all looked great and just seemed excited to be presenting the movie 🎬. Nice interview.
Jacob a filipino, watching the film a month before us filipinos LMAO
I am SO SHOOK they just agreed with Jimmy that Zendaya is Toms girlfriend.
I see Zendaya chose the toilet paper dress...
Sooooo. They dating now orrr was that just a joke....
Cant wait to watch this movie and see what we will get next 🕷🕷🕷
That's a bold claim,  but the year's most anticipated movie is definitely The Matrix.
Jimmy: instead of the hospital you called your GIRLFRIEND to… me: finally someone said it publicly!!
7:36 look at Benedict's reaction he's so humble man
I can't see the two other important co-leads🤭
Tom has improved! I just hope my notification dont give me spoilers
I cannot freaking wait for Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness
Don't u think is weird... that they don't want the people to spoil it 🤔
why is zendaya wearing the clothes i used to make from paper
Love all of them can't wait to see spiderman
Is it just me or does Tom's shoes have some huge heels ?!   Wonder why tho!
Kimmel looks great for 54. Honestly thought he was 40
Jesus is coming soon repent and turn to him before it’s too late! He loves you so much and wants to take away your pain.❤️ He died for your sins on the cross so that you can be forgiven through repentance and saved through faith in him alone. During this stressful time, He is the best stress relief. Pray and ask Him to save you and help you, and He will. “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.” - Matthew 11:28 NIV
I was surprised to hear Jimmy casually saying "girlfriend" lol
6:32 Jimmy said your girlfriend and he didn't even stutter.
Benedict always making sure Tom doesn't spoil things unintentionally
I genuinely love the fact that Jimmy is asking a lot of questions towards Jacob to try and make him feel included. I felt bad for him during most of the interviews because most of the questions were geared towards Zendaya and Tom.
Benefit of the Cucumber is such a great actor for doctor strange.
It was so great to so Andrew and Tobey in this movie
2:40 It feels that way because it’s a comic saga that will never end because comics were always unrealized storyboard movies. There’s tons of material and history and this is Chapter 13 of a 20 season show of superheroes. The best part is they always crossed over and teamed up so it was a natural character development progression that could be independent and codependent.
The fact he actually called Zendaya toms girlfriend really shocked me
I’m so happy to hear Jacob talk!!!
6:31 Jimmy calling Zendaya Tom's girlfriend. I can't even.
Pretty funny, lol
Tom: we saw it  Kevin feige: prepare the mute button
Jimmy really said “GIRLFRIEND” with whole chest 😭💀
World premiere? Cries in Japan..
I love how Jimmy says "your girlfriend" with no regrets or hesitation haha
hoak
3:00 listen carefully folks !!!
6:47 "These guys are Gen-Z, i'm Gen-Old"
I FROZE and stopped breathing when Jimmy called Zendaya Tom's GIRLFRIEND
I will never stop being amazed at how easily Tom switches accents
They didn't correct Jimmy when he said "girlfriend".
im honestly impresed tom hasnt leaked anything yet
Benedict has been doing 2 different marvel movies in the same time, actually three including power of the dog
He changed thumbnail
I love how Benedict is genuinely enjoying being part of MCU and this Spider-Man movie. He's a great actor and he also doesn't look down at the superhero genre like some other people do.
6:33
FINAALLYYY Tom and Benedict doing press for NWH together
The hype is real and this episode proved it
Marvel has sent Benedict to keep a check on Tom's mouth, for sure 😂
I love how Tom is sitting to include Benedict Cumberbatch and Jacob in the discussion
Tom and Zendaya are literally me Rewatching a movie right after just watching it 😂😂😂
“ call ur girlfriend “ 😏😏🤞🏾🤞🏾
jimmy really called zendaya his girlfriend and they both didnt even react to it omllll
Benedict looks so fine oh my gosh...
Jimmy really called them out by saying girlfriend 😂😂😂
I love the spiderman cast. Except Zendaya. I can't explain it but she just..... idk. Anyone else..? No? Only me?
Tom has done it.  Before everyone tries to get the scoop from these Marvel actors.  Now Tom has scared everyone so much, we are all just praying there are no spoilers.
Zendaya 😍
GIRLFRIEND 😏
Zendaya and Tom looking at each other between the laughter and jokes is freakin' histerical!  You can tell they really enjoy each other!
No Way Homie
Jimmy calling Zendaya "girlfriend of Tom" 😱👀
Notice how jimmy said “call your girlfriend” 😏☺️💗💗💗💗
The Benedict pic of him skating about to hit the trailer lmao
Tom should get a trophy or something for not spoiling the movie 😂✨
I just realised, growing up in 2021 with these amazing actors starring in these amazing movies is gonna be something i'm going to cherish forever. Zendaya and Tom Holland being the ultimate couple of this year, starring in possibly the BIGGEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME featuring all 3 Spider-Men along with the iconic villains will be something to look back on and smile upon knowing I got to witness this along with the WHOLE WORLD feeling like one massive friend group, talking about it, and wondering whats going to happen!!
Jimmy has guts to call her his girlfriend in such a huge public interview for the first time.  Meanwhile Tomdaya shippers be like: Protect him at all the costs!
Among all of them , Still Benedict is outclass marvellous 🥰🥰🥳
6:10 my contract's up cumberbatch said something whoops ?
That suit Zendaya is wearing is really great.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Imagine if it was Holland, Garfield and Maguire.
6:32 So they finally accepted it in a public interview.  About Damn time!
6:32 Girlfriend?  OMG! So they kinda accepted it officially.  Yay!!!!!!
was I he only one who went :O at the girlfriend part. PUBLIC BABY!!
WoW' you have nice 😎
Tom still embarrassed about leaking the title of Spider-Man Phone Home
💖
I feel sorry for Toby and Andrew not being able to show their face anywhere they can't really celebrate their appearance at all unless it's after the film
Why yall still using 720p 💀
I wouldn't trust that Tom kid in my house. I hear he has sticky fingers.
The cast is just as eager as we are for the movie to come out so they don't have to hide anything about it anymore. I gotta give credit to them for being able to complete this entire film during a pandemic; I'm sure it made filming even more difficult than it already was. No Way Home will definitely be the biggest movie since the pandemic began!
Leave it to Zendaya to make toilet paper look like haute couture.
6:33  Damnnn
Wait so today is the world premier but it won’t be in theatres until the 16? Is this correct
I know Jacob Batalon is the least famous actor with barely any movies in his resume in that bunch, but I’m glad he’s a major part in most of the press tour junkets for Spider-Man No Way Home.
Even I get nervous every time Tom open his mouth 😂
Tom copies Robert Downey Jr.. that entery and open his button
6:33 , did jimmy said they r dating😍😍😍
They brought Benedict for this one to keep Tom in check
Tobey goat maguire the best spiderman
HAHHA jimmy just saying girlfriend with no regrets is so funny
Benedict be like : " I use the script to destroy the script"
Jimmy thinks he so slick dropping that girlfriend title into that comment
Let's gooooo marvel fans!!!!
The fact that Tom Holland hasn't spoiled Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's appearances in No Way Home worries me. It probably means they're not in it but we'll find out soon!
i’m honestly shocked at the amount of things Tom hasn’t spoiled yet😂
Ok both Tom and Ben look high as hell honestly like they smoke a blunt together before this or drank alot lol
Andrew and Tobey aren’t in it. I saw the movie
Zendaya is pure Class
6:32 you're welcome everyone :)

Benedict Cumberbatch:Protect this man at all cost.!!What a great actor and human being.
“What are you doing? It’s been like a week” HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
To hear that this will be their first time experiencing it together is pretty cool and special they seem genuinely hyped to see the movie.
Tom wants to tell us so bad 😂😂😂
Smooth kimmel, reaaaaal smooth with gf comment
“You can bring four people” “That’s not gonna work” “Im Spider-Man” “You see the poster? Bring everyone”
They look so uncomfortable at 6:30 😅 when jimmy said that z is tom's girlfriend
