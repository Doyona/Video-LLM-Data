The music in this trailer is such a emotional masterpiece to Chadwick. wakanda forever!!
You guys look fucking embarrassing with the cuck faces on the thumbnail... One of you is an embarrassment to the Filipino community lol
I watched it 2 nights ago with my family at the cinema. So emotional yet very powerful. By far my favourite marvel movie
You guys have to make sure you do a review right after watching the movie.  I absolutely love your reaction videos.
This might be the movie that redeems the past movies
100% these guys are paid by MCU to praise this trash.
Ooooh yeah I’m definitely gonna cry I. The theater😂😂😂this looks beautiful.
The original song at the begining just got me... wakanda for EVA🙌🏿
Why haven’t y’all been reviewing the rings of power
Meso-American Indian, not really Hispanic. Looks amazing 💯🔥🔥🔥
It looks like Coogler has conjured up an opera. Need this film NOW
The best moment for me is when M'Baku pounds his chest like the Mountain Gorilla King he is and straight-up dives into the waters below to take on the Atlanteans on their own turf. I feel sorry for the Atlanteans.
This is the best trailer ever created!!!!!!
Prediction michela cole will be new bp not shuri
Nerdrotic, rk outpost, thequartering won't make a video about this trailer. These guys will lol. Its like Andrew tate not making a video of Logan Paul. Very sad
All I know is they better COMPLETELY finish this movie.... Special effects and all.
The entire Dorq Milaje needs a suit . A panther army
I want to see Namor drown Aquaman lol
wow greg didnt cry great job soyboi
Meh. Should've recasted Tchalla, Namor isnt right hes Kotal Khan and Riri Williams is just a woke pile of garbage
If she had a small cape in the end lol
yes i got my ticket as well
I just really hope the ironheart part doesn't disrupt the flow of the movie,
SPOILERS*****       I heard this takes place during the blip and they are going to recast T’Challa for BP3
Actually really liked the trailer until Iron Heart yelled “let’s go”… she just annoys me
I Refuse to believe Angela Bassett is 64. SHE IS GORGEUS
Namor looks so badass! If they follow history the Fantastic Four can’t be far behind! I hope!
Can we all agree that Ryan Coogler should direct secret wars?!
Dope Trailer Again!! 2:01 Attuma!! Hope he's very Strong & Beast especially underwater like he was in Avengers Assemble!!
Someone actually said something very important. Marvel is very good at misconception. We all want it to be Shuri. But lets not forget. T’Challa wanted Nakia to stay and be his queen. 😮
This without a doubt the most normie & bland content I've ever seen on this site.  You guys have the personality of soggy white bread.
Could be Nakia. What if she and T’challa got married, she’d be the queen and the natural successor of the suit.
Just in those few seconds of Angela Bassett we got in that trailer...If that's just a sample of what she's gonna deliver..There better be some Oscar Conversations happening..Woman gave me chills!
Gonna be as boring as the first.
I'm in tears
gonna be the best marvel movie in like a year or so i think
Music from Zambia 🇿🇲 ❤️❤️
Are they going to explain how Shuri wins the no power fight against someone else or do they just give it to her for girl power reasons?
Holy shit the music is incredible!!!
Ryan said he tho about quit being a movie director after Chads death, im glad he didnt.
I see everyone crying. Will the Queen die??? I hope not 😢
We saw the suit in the first trailer
Can’t be anyone else
A big disappointment on the way it won't be nearly as good as the first one which in my opinion wasn't all that just saying
We never saw Tchalla train beforehand so hand so not sure why Shuri would need her training to have been shown. Super excited with this one. Really want to see what Namor can do.
Congrats on trending you guys!
Worst fucking movies in the entire franchise.  First one was the most cliche, sympathy-driven drivel I have ever seen in a script and its casting.
Anyone think that somehow dr doom will be in this. Btw I bring this up since he gets vibranium In one arc.
Can we give a shout-out to whoever made this trailer??? Gave away nothing plot wise, soundtrack gave me chills all throughout, and the emotion was entirely there. I’m hyped to see this movie now.
I don't get the hype at all
Finally I’m excited for a Marvel movie since End Game!
Can't f'n wait! Also, while it'll be tough, we gotta get away from calling it Atlantis. It's Talocan I believe. Which makes more sense with the Mayan/Aztec culture being the new direction.
🤩🤩🤩😍🥰🥰😍🤩🤩
A day before my birthday. This is amazing!! Can't wait to watch it in the cinema.
THE SONG PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND ITS A ZAMBIAN SONG DONE BY CHEF 187 AND SAMPA THE GREAT 🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲
This is trailer is so satisfying 😢❤️ I LOVED IT
I heard this is taking place during the snap and they’re just sad that Tchalla vanished and they’ll just recast him in the next one 🤔 that would be a super smart way to do it.
I lmao when you all joked that’s Umbaku 😅
Congrats on trending, watching again to help the cause
Still can't understand how a metal ore bestows genius level IQs and technological advancements centuries beyond that of any other nation. It defies logic. It's the very definition of fantasy. It might as well be magic (and please don't quote A.C. Clarke; it's not relevant).
The move will be fine as long as they stay away from blackitics/ politics!
I loved it so much. It's going to be a tidal wave of emotions fun and excitement !! Love you guys! 💖✌️
Your thumbnail faces need a good slap.
I was shit on for thinking the first film was underdeveloped and given less of a shit about but THIS is given everything. The script, the score, the budget, is respected. You can tell
With everything we see, I have a theory for this movie. If u look in one of the scenes you can see namor throwing a spear at the window right? what if ramonda dies. Cause you can see general crying and a spear going down, ALSO YOU CAN SEE SHURI CRYING IN THE SAME ROOM. watch my theory be wrong. but it is a possibility..
wuaoo so amazing... I can´t wait...
These two dog shit are fuckin scammers they chose me as their free give away winner and then want me to pay for the shipping and ask for the number of my bank account. STOP Supporting them guys
I love how namor flying looks like he’s air skiing, makes his flight scenes different from other characters who can fly
Believe me people are gonna cry on this more than Titanic movie. Its more than real
The music is emotional 😢❤
Ryan Coogler is a MASTER of detail. The fact that Namor’s flight patterns and abilities are that of a hummingbird, one of the iconic animals of Central American religion/ ideology, is just phenomenal. It explains why he can just joystick through the air like that
Dope stuff...this will be big
Fun fact. Namors wings aren't where his flight comes from. They just help him maneuver around like in that scene where he is side stepping energy blasts while in the air.
Better not be any janky CGI in this one! But can she fight? Lol
Was really hoping it was an alternate  universe Killmonger, but hey.
Bots in the comments,, Bots in the comments, everywhere.!!
Looks amazing. I just hope Iron Heart isn’t a tacked on character and actually has a sensible connection to the story
I don’t know if they’ll be pulling a switch with who BP will be? There’s no solid indication yet that it’s Shuri, maybe she’s a red herring? Or maybe not? Lol. But excited for this movie.
I think its Nakia, myself.  Letisha Wright has some some problematic things, and Lupita Nyong'o is a better actress and her character has her own claims as a tribal heir and T'Challa's...whatever they were lol   but...still probably Shuri.  The BP helmet design matches her look from the end of the first movie.
This is the third time Wakanda thought T'Challa died. The first was in his movie. The second was when he got snapped. No wonder Ramonda is pissed. How many times she got keep losing her son?
Apparently this takes place during the Snap
Love how it's coming out on 11.11 🥲
ime be real looks boring
i will continue to say mbaku wouldve been a better bp
The soundtrack 😩😩😩 Zambia kuchalo🥺🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲
the sound/music that they used when Shuri lands is sorta off-putting because it makes it seem like such a gentle landing (like a cat) and I mean it probably was silent but the way they used that sound instead of putting some big drop was really nice
This is shaping up to be the best thing to release this phase, alongside Shang-Chi. High stakes & emotional resonance. Exactly what we need! Chadwick would be proud.
Tchalla is a fictional character, he is not real. Chadwick Boseman was a real person who passed away. It makes nonsense for him to unfortunately die and then Tchalla has to die but on then William Hurt dies and their rumors of Ross being recast. WTF??? How is that any different?
This movie is going to be such a emotional, beautiful experience. Wakanda Forever!!
What a beautiful trailer. You can feel the music and the action pulse through you, man I’m totally buying my tickets right now.
This movie is going to be such a emotional, beautiful experience. Wakanda Forever!!
I do hope to see Queen Ramonda leading her army and saying the line for T'Chala! Similar to what we saw on What If. We're gonna flood Wakanda with tears.
This movie is going to be such a emotional, beautiful experience. Wakanda Forever!!
Long live Chadwick boseman
That thing you don't like about yourself is what makes you really interesting.
I’m so excited to see more of Atlantis!! It looks visually stunning and Namors presence is really felt in this trailer more than the last. I’m intrigued to see where his character stands by the end of the movie
I hope our main character doesn’t catch the mumps.. we don’t want two deaths
it seems too obvious so i’m thinking it’s Nakia
Shuri looks freaking awesome. In the comics she’s more feminine but here it looks like a Killmonger inspired suit it’s amazing‼️‼️
You're someone's reason to smile.
Looks like an Iron Man suit or Iron Heart
Namor flying is the stupidest thing I watched in a while 😂
This looks so great, I'm sure Chadwick is smiling down at it. I can't wait to see the movie, the emotions are poured into it it seems!
This movie is going to be such a emotional, beautiful experience. Wakanda Forever!!
I can see why they've picked Ryan Coogler for one of the upcoming Avengers movies. He really must have impressed them with this movie and makes me more excited for this to release!
You can tell Ryan Coogler really cares about the characters and story. This doesn't look like a director who will sacrifice a storyline for some laughs. You can see emotional state he and the writers were in when they worked on this.
I think the movie will be good but not great
Ehh
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾
Cum inside of me Jesus. Cum Inside of me. Cum inside of me Jesus. Cum inside of me. Sword of truth
I don’t know if you guys caught it but that reflection of Namor in the window getting ready to toss his spear looks INSANE. I wonder if that’s when the flood takes place.
This is going to be 🔥 The music is just insane!
One thing that keeps jumping out at me is that Ramonda says "show them who WE are".  When T'Challa was fighting to become BP she urged him to "show them who YOU are". I'm not sure what that WE means...
Namor got them new Air Jordans
I hope Namor doesn't turn out to be a bad guy.  I know there's going to be a war, but he could still wind up as a good guy.
For God so love the world he gave his only begotten son name Jesus Christ that who so ever believe in him shall not perish but have everlasting life commit to Christ have a relationship with God accept Jesus as your lord and savior ur choice no forcing But God will forgive u for your sins he knows you and he wants you to come to him come home God is great and almighty and even tho I forgot what else I was gonna say ik that God will make me better as a person and u commit to him while you still have a chance he will get you to eternal life repent and commit to Christ Lord
so sick of saggiN movies and shows such ghetto trash
What if it's Okoye or Lupitas character.Yes all evidence points to Shuri.But what if and it's a BIG IF it's NOT SHURI. Everyone Assume it Shuri  by the trailer, and if it's the trailer chances are is NOT Shuri
I honestly haven't watched Mid Marvel or Mid Hulk just because of how ignorant the directors are. The comic material is nothing to them, everything is jokes. Moon Knight was entertaining even though it was all over the place, what the hell is Mid marvel and Mid hulk man... so bad, I hope Marvel goes toward BP: WF and builds on that, the kids who grew up with Iron Man and Steve Rodgers are adults, and we don't have the time and patience to see Jennifer Walter's twerking with Megan Thee Stallion...
Bring your tissues to the theater. I ain't sharing mine.
Personally think It's Nakia in the suit. Unless this movie is a Shuri's redemption ark, she's not worthy. not to mention she's not really combat trained. Where as Nakia is both.
Justice League Snyder cut vibes...weird but good...
This is going to be easily my favorite MCU movie, I already know.
The only thing i am waiting for (which Will be when the movie comes to the Theaters), is HOW T’Challa died in Universe🤔
I can’t wait 🙏
With these trailers, Ryan Coogler has confirmed that he indeed holds the Soul Stone 🙅🏽‍♂️🖤✊🏽
Betting on it being Shuri but lets not forget about Nakia who would honestly be a better BP but im all for Shuri to carry the mantle
you guys are on the trending page!!
it is definitely shuri.  just look at the white dots on the mask.  it's her.
Snore,fart,Snore.....
​GREAT AS ALWAYS! I would like to recommend the Reginald Hudlin BP comicbook story "The Deadliest of the Species," which is about the birth of ShuriPanther. Reginald Hudlin created Shuri
That suit looks  sick
Well, this trailer confirms leaks. I guess that we'll really get THAT post-credits scene... 👀 (not gonna bring up what it is, obviously).
Man i love both of these guys psotivity about my favoreite topics ive been watching them for a couple months and ive been an absolute marvel fan since childhood so thanks guys for the reactions!
Over 1 billion for sure
Dios los ama BUSQUEN de el,bendiciones
We also need to talk about the posters for this film. I’ve seen 7 of them and they’re all incredible. Some of the best in the MCU!
This song is from 🇿🇲 it's called never forget by chef 187 ft sampa
I’m glad you mentioned the phenomenal sound design for this trailer specifically
I'm almost as excited to see how the two you react to the movie as I am to see it myself! Come on, November 11th!
Thank you guys for doing this. Whenever a trailer or news drops I always look forward to what y’all post!! Congrats on the trending! U deserve it! Wish y’all the best
Shuri would be next in line, she is a princess and only one to be next on the throne.
it must be shuri. the face dots on the armour match the face dots on her face in the first movie.
God I got so emotional during this.  Rest in peace Chadwick, so glad he’s being honored beautifully <3
I just want to say that Angela Bassett looks amazing for a 64 year old.
Namor looks freaking amazing. The way he was jumping in the air as if he was rollerblading in the sky was so distinct from the flying characters.
i got my tix! can’t wait!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
This movie is going to be an amazing, emotional roller coaster honoring a legend. Rest In Peace Chadwick Boseman. Wakanda Forever❤️
Me who has read all the Percy Jackson books: Hey those are the kind of shoes Luke gave to Percy.
I’m literally gonna skip school to watch this movie i dont care
One of the most powerful movies of all time just from the trailers alone. Ryan Coogler has outdone himself with a somehow even better story than the original and a significant improvement in the direction as well.
WAKE up! This is not a message or gospel of judgement. I am not trying to judge you,I have no right.I am just as filthy a sinner as you. But I have acknowledged that I am a sinner in need of a savior and that is Jesus, the son of God. I want you to also be saved. Jesus will come to get his faithful servants.  Get Ready to Go home. Jesus is coming like a thief in the night and you don't want him to catch you sleeping. I love you and so I care about the eternal destination of your soul. Please understand that the world will eventually end and we will all be judged at that time. We are all sinners and we all fall short of God's righteousness, but he loves us and doesn't want us to be cast away into hell because of our rebellion. He made a way for us all to be redeemed by believing in his son Jesus Christ and by accepting him we will be made right in God's sight. You have the choice to choose who you will serve and you have the choice to choose if you will listen. If you choose not to listen, you will open yourself up to deception. Jesus is the way the truth and the life. This world hates him and his Ultimate authority and so it insults him and all his ways, but this world and the things of it will be destroyed. Jesus is the only way to heaven, to God's wonderful presence. Hell is absent of God. It has no love, health, joy, peace. Hell is no party like the media makes it seem. It is a prison made for the devil and his angels and those who choose to align with him and rebel against God will join him there. They will become God's enemies and God will overcome them. Please listen don't choose to be his enemy, choose to be his child. He is a good father. He will never leave you or forsake you. People will disappoint you, but he never will. Even if you don't get what you want, he knows what you need and he will provide for those who seek him. Believe and repent, accept the gift of salvation that you can't earn. Jesus is  the ONLY way to God, to salvation. Be patient for his return, we may not know the day or the hour, but we know for certain that he is coming. RECOMMENDED:  OFF THE KIRB MINISTRIES WATCHMAN ON THE WALL 88
Shuri is gonna be so badass! I wonder how they'll explain T'Challa's death though.... RIP Chad.
Personally, what gave me chills while watching this trailer are the mother's words,  "I know what you whisper," "Their protector is gone", I almost lost it here, the hole that was left in the kingdom after the death of their protector, their king everybody knows it, everybody knows there's something missing........ and but then Ramonda tells Shuri(I'm thinking) what she once told her son, to show them who she is, that it is in their family, it is their identity to protect and be the shield of their nation. Trailer was awesome, thanks for the reaction guys.
🫂🤎😌🏳
YESSSS
Calling it now: Doom got snapped and came back to his kingdom in ruins and is angry that the 2 most powerful nations in the word did not prevent it which then makes him orchestrate the death of T'Challa and pit Wakanda against Atlantis. Shuri is obviously under the mask but kind of wish it was T'Challa's fiance instead to switch it up on the comics like they usually do with this universe.
Rejects Nation Forever !!!
Love the reaction and discussion as always guys! Also as of rn you guys are #10 on the Trending Page !! Keep up the great work !!
I’m gonna love this like how I love She hulk and Thor Love and Thunder I have spoken
the ankle baby wings looks gay..
This music... Ludwig Göransson really knocked it out of the park with this one.
And Disney will give us more overuse of CGI.
Can't wait for this movie, looking forward to everything but iron heart. I hope she's not shoe horned in
We all need to stop we know good well that is Robert Downey Jr. in that suit.😁
I can't wait to see Shuri as blk panther before we get our main one. Its a lot going on in this movie, like I'm anticipating Namor, Iron Heart, who's the main villain, and whats in the end credits 🤯
LET'S FKN GO!!!
this is the nail in the coffin for me I am done with marvel. they could have went so many directions with this movie and they decide to use Chadwick Bosemans death as another chance to feminize another character.
Shuri is a misdirect.
Literally felt chills watching this
My only worry is how they will kill off tchalla in the movie. I dont want it to be some lame death like he got sick like the rumored leaks, becuase that would be marketing over chadwicks deaths.
4:19 "in my culture, dead is not the end"
Whoever is in the suit, their arms are very slim.. which is why I'm thinking it's a robot and someone(likely shuri) is "piloting" it. It's not a new concept for the MCU.. Tony did it in Iron Man 3. Shuri did it with the car in the last film.
I think you should remove Shuri Suit Reveal as it is a spoiler tbh
4:04 possible if not Sheri. 🤔 nah it's Sheri 🤞who knows what marvel does.
Oh yeah, both of them are just.. I got nothing. Best trailers ever going to be the best Marvel movie so far.
I gotta say, this trailer was a little better than the first one ngl can’t wait for this movie
The pain of having an epic trailer come out in class is so big 😫
Such a blast of cultures I'm loving it.
I think the two cultures will ultimately combine to fight a larger threat….I hope it’s a nod to Doctor Doom.
Look like the Queen is leader and Shuri is BP like how it was before T'Chaka died in Civil War
No one’s talking about this but I’m so excited about seeing Attuma in this movie, who I believe that is flying up out of the water 👏👏👏
"Pulse Pounding" Well said. [edit] Ramonda says her "*entire* family is gone," so we might see Nakia in the suit.  That resolves the fighting skillset since she's a former Dora Milaje.
I'd still have recast T'Challa. But just concentrating on what we have. I'm fairly sure that's Shuri as BP. I'd have went with Nakia. But I trust Ryan Coogler and Feige.
Got my tickets!!!
i love it
I swear I can’t watch these BP trailers without tearing up
Always refreshing to watch Greg and John positively react after watching Tyrone Magnus bitch and moan like a man-child lmao
yass
You guys should check out Cosmic Wonder’s new video he explains potentially why Namor would be fighting Wakanda in the movie and it may be related to his origin story! Pretty interesting theory
I’m hyped! I bought my tickets this morning
There are no Atlanteans in the MCU or Atlantis.. it's Called Talocan in the MCU
The question is HOW T'Challa die? Or is this set during the dusting/blip?
I’m definitely going to see this movie in theaters!!
Namor is only good thing everything else just stupid
L
Traditional African views on death are beautiful in the sense that we do mourn. We grieve the beautiful life lost and the energy they left throughout their life. However, we celebrate because that energy, their soul, returns to peace, returns to bliss. Their soul is returning home, and we couldn't be happier to give them a wondrous send-off and even prouder to keep laughing, living, and loving with the energy they left in our lives. In our culture death is not the end, just more of a stepping-off point🧙🏿‍♂️🙏🏿😌🔮💜🎵7️⃣
Time for all of us to bring tissues to our local movie theaters because we’re all guaranteed to cry from how well they honor and respect Chadwick’s legacy.
Did the guys cry again
Its Talocan not Mythical Greek Atlantis
It's not Atlantis it's Talochan
Love my Indigenous people representation from South America on screen, it's so surreal
Sampa the great on the truck 🇿🇲💪💪💪
Yeah..uh…I’m pretty shuri…
I mean... it COULD be Nakia or Okoye... but, yeah, it's Shuri.
Namor is coming to destroy wakanda 🔥
I really do not care what anyone says, I think this movie is gonna be amazong and I’m so stoked
You mean that wasn't M'Baku? 😏
I loved this trailer almost as much as the first one. Emotional but also inspiring and shows the resiliency of Wakanda and it definitely looks like they are going to bring the fight to Namor and the Atlanteans. Wakanda Forever 💪
Wow this movie is gonna be so awesome 🔥🔥🔥🔥🤙🏻
We can hear the Dora Milaje theme when new BP lands, it’s Nakia
Okoye would make far more sense. She's got to be Wakanda's best warrior now.
0:14 Same! Anyone else?
2 hours and 41 minutes.  that's like 6 shows on disney plus!  😄
I'm so hyped for this movie  wakanda forever
It’s a monarchy no? It’s shuri as blank panther and her alone
That's my country sound track song it's talking about a female King 👑 Zambia ku Chalo 🇿🇲🌍🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🥰 that means Zambia to the world 🌎🌍
Kukulkán is the great serpent Mayan God.  When I Heard that word, as a latín, I was blown away.
Iron Heart is in an anime mech?!? I can't take all this...I'm not ready!
Beautiful  trailer 🔥🔥🔥🙌🏾 the song in the back ground tooo😍🔥🔥🔥🔥
How do you want to shit on T'challa's legacy? M-She-U: Yes!!
Now that's a trailer.
Damn!!! Can we avoid using images from the trailer? It spoils things for us that don’t want to see stuff prior to the movie. I can’t look for a movie reaction without getting crap like this. Be considerate.
I know its not necessarily indicative of quality but im glad this movie is 160 minutes long. I felt that some recent films couldve benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh some things out more or hang longer on certain moments, and thats something imo that this film is definitely going to need to do.  Cannot wait to see this one!
Thanks for reaction! Hello from Ukraine 👋🇺🇦
Id always said Coogler would have to do a "godfather/Michael Corleone arc" for this to work..  Shuris basically Michael.. the youngest &least interested in leadership or even the family business.. but after a series of family tragedies has to grow up fast out their wants aside &take on the mantle of succession.  This will be a MCU masterpiece &a touching tribute to a great man
Hallie Berry as BP, confirmed.
Let's go wakanda forever 💙 ❤️ 💯?
WAKANDA FOREVER MFERS
Suprised he didn’t start crying
Y’all the smartest YouTubers I met so far💯ofc it’s shuri look at the size I like y’all YouTube channel I’m subscribing💯♥️
I still think Killmonger is coming back...this trailer is throwing us off
This looks so amazing and powerful RIP Chadwick Boseman.
Chills more than infinity war trailer
I’m so excited to see this movie. OMG. Rip Chadwick. Wakanda Forever
Got my tickets. Man, this whole trailer gave me nipple chills!!
Hope dr doom is behind this wakanda vs talocan war... And appears in the post credits
I cannot wait! So is everyone wearing white for Thursday premiere lol
Like they say “Save the best for Last” what better movie to end phase 4 with, this is going to be Epic in the MCU can’t wait!
Almost getting Winter Soldier vibes in terms of tone and the fights. That’s a good thing. Not a fan of Iron Heart but the trailer overall was phenomenal.
As a Mexican I can't wait to see the representation of Kꞌukꞌulkaan and the Maya culture, I know everyone thinks that it's the Aztecs but the Aztec named Kꞌukꞌulkaan as Quetzalcoatl also can't wait to hear Namor speak Mayan
M she u
😈🤴🏾👸🏾 WAKANDA FOREVER
Look at this art
Nice spoilers 🖕🏼
So excited for Namor and where the story will take us. Wakanda Forever definitely deserves to be the conclusion of this Phase.
When do you get ur invite to the premiere?
Feige is like I am all in. I am beating on Coogler as he should. Also the movie is like 2 hrs and 40 mins plus so we have a lot to unpack
I always thought Shuri would be the new BP...maybe it's because I've worked for a couple family companies and always see the offspring coming in when a promotion is available.....but I'm hoping they rally show the internal conflict Shuri would have taking on the BP mantle. Grief, doubt, imposter syndrome.....it's all there for a great character arc. Very excited for this one.
It may be a misdirect. Maybe Shuri designed the new suit but it's actually Nakia. I mean it's probably Shuri but could be a misdirect.
NAMOR! LETS GO LATINOS! SO PROUD SO STOKED HE LOOKS AND SOUNDS AMAZING! The trailer overall best so far post end game!
cant belive people were criticizing the actor of namor because of his body, he looks phenomenal !!
LOOKS AMAZING!!! but sadly itll be bombed by morons saying its woke or theyre forcing women in a male role shuri/ironheart even though they both were established in comics
Can’t wait! This film looks epic and we get a true mutant in the MCU!!
Can’t wait! This film looks epic and we get a true mutant in the MCU!!
Can’t wait! This film looks epic and we get a true mutant in the MCU!!
💖💖
😱😱😱
Turns out you don’t need 100 jokes in a movie or tv shows marvel wait a go guys lol.
I like how one guy keeps referring Kukulhan's kingdom as Atlantis. Kukulhan looks like Namor but he's  different. I agree I love seeing my culture represented but not at the expense of a character older than most people's parents. Get the character right first before we start doing different versions. Also T'Challa was done wrong by not recasting and even Boseman had been quoted saying for the character to be recasted. Marvel wasted such a good character. Go watch the films that he was in now, he's story feels like a let down.
Even more kudos to Ryan Coogler for how Namor  is able to move in the sky. I am of Purépecha decent and many of the symbols and artwork from the region depict hummingbirds as a divine animal. Seeing Namor be able to move in the same flight patterns is pretty phenomenal, there’s really only one animal that is able to do that besides dragon flies, and tying in that little detail is awesome
MAybe Shuri... but also maybe Nakia ?
I’m more hype for this than anything coming out next year I’m sorry lmao can’t wait to see shuri and ironheart and Angela’s performance 😭😭 also i know it may sound stupid but I think we are gonna get multiple panthers
Namor is king of Talocan as Mayan and Mesoamérica not Atlantean for realism. Latin represent. Love the change.
This trailer had me crying it's too early for this 😭
Give me Dr. Doom
Gonna be best movie of the year
As much as I wanted Nakia to be the new BP, I can't argue that Shuri looks awesome in that suit
Namor’s type of flying gave me chills
Namor looks so cool
That last shot of the new suit is cinematic gold! Haters are about to gag after they see this trailer. LOL! I cannot wait to see this on the big screen!
I guess the queen mother dies too
Yup, definitely crying
Solid trailer but I think Marvel has been showing wayy too much in their trailers making the movies not as climatic. Should've saved the suit reveal
I don't think its only Shuri, its possible that is Okoye or Nakia, or all three of them having suits.
I agree some of marvels best trailers
My God! That opening track... Jeez! This is gonna be massive!!!
I mean Namor's primary reason for doing things tend to be because he's a giant dick
Most broken people can be great leader
Emotional and exciting what a way to show but not show everything and that suit yes
please reaction Korea movie "hello ghost "
Iron heart ❤ will be >>>>>>>>>>> ironman. Riri williams will be >>>>>>>tony Stark.
Tailka Waititi should take a page out of Ryan Coogler's book, write & direct a story befitting the gravitas of the character, instead of turning him into a joke character. Thor needs to be a serious character again. A beautiful thought-provoking trailer. This might just reboot Marvel.
With the amount of negative feed back Love and Thunder and She-Hulk as received(so far for she-hulk anyway) Marvel making this feel like a very serious movie is what’s needed for the MCU. An iconic character and actor was lost so his legacy needs to be honored. Both trailers did not disappoint and I can’t wait for Wakanda Forever
That was a Zambian 🇿🇲 song in the background! Unite!!!
Ryan Gosling looks amazing in this!!
Up in the heavens Chadwick Boseman and Stan Lee are smiling down I'd love to believe.   Excelsior and Wakanda Forever!!
when you are Zambian. and your nation artists are finally out there, it just give you chills
Namor flying around dodging energy blast already looks dope af. So excited to see what he alone will be able to do against Wakanda army
Why do I feel like this is all one big misdirect
Iron man: going uuup!!!
Man the tribute to Chadwick looks so beautiful I can only imagine what would have happend if he was able to do this movie but man this was a very awesome trailer 👏
Attuma looks great
Except it’s not Atlantis. They’re not Atlanteans. They’re using Mayan mythology instead, can’t remember the name they used but I looked it up after it was named in an interview
It looks ok at best
I,m hearing a rumor that, BP's death might be related to the "snap" (this takes place right after the snap). Yes, the Avengers had Shuri gone as well, but Scott Lang was also listed but wasn't snapped away, also thinking about what Feige said about re-casting too soon, which might lead to secret invasion if this film takes place after the snap. What I'm saying is this might be a situation, much like what happened with Showtime and Spartacus, this all depends (in my opinion) on when this takes place. I believe they will re-cast, T'Challa is too pivotal to the MCU moving forward, will they do what they did to Electra in the secret invasion to T'Challa ? Will a BP/T'Challa from the multiverse show up to replace ours?
My one issue with it is when we see Namor 'jumping' through the air, looked dodgy to me so I hope that's not indicitive of how he's going to be moving around
Dude!!! So far the trailers for this movie deserve to be given ALL OF THE AWARDS themselves. I hope the movie can meet this level of quality. (FTR I'm not worried too much about the movie quality. RC has never made a bad film. Also, when the love and respect for Chadwick is thrown into the mix, along with this wonderful cast, we end up with a recipe bound to be legendary!)  Can't wait to see Atlantis in the MCU!! I also hope that the movie features Attuma. I didn't put 2 and 2 together last time with the Atlanteans who have blue skin but Attuma also has blue skin. Going to be EPIC!!!!
So happy they showed Attuma, he looks epic
Love the choice of music , it's from my county Zambia "sampa the great ft chef 187 never forget" is the title...if you wanna listen.
That is for sure Shuri in the suit! I’m not upset about it personally. Let the girls have their hero for Halloween, and guys can still enjoy the ride and hey they can still dress as her if they want. Great trailer, seems great fun and also quite deep. Really truly excited
Is anyone noticing the reflection of Namor in the window at the throne room In wakanda about to attack?
It looks alright
All the glorified virtue signalling. This is gonna suck.
Will Bucky make a Cameo??????  Hmmmmmm
I know its comic accurate but man those ankle Wings are hilarious
Everything looks so good. The script, the visuals, the characters, Namor looks dope and looks like he’ll be a problem👀and of course the soundtrack is sounding amazing
Wakanda Forever….FOREVER
I can see Nakia will be the new BP, and shuri will focus on Ironheart.
Best trailer ever
If they really change shuri then I think this movie can be a banger; I really didn’t care for her in the first one, like a bargain bin Tony stark.
One question?      Whose wearing white to the premiere for Chadwick
The way this trailer weaved together these two worlds like a beautifully complex tapestry… what a sight to behold. 🥹
Not sure about the Namor flying on those little feet wings.  Looks just silly to me.
The part where Namor said "only the most broken people can be great leaders" sent shivers down people spine.
Billion dollar movie right there an i really think they should bring in T'Challa son from the multiverse
Man this is so bittersweet. People know it's going to be emotional due to Chadwick's absence, but people believe the rest of the cast is gonna put on an amazing performance. People can't wait to see it!!
That silent landing at the end was such a beautiful choice.
No forced comedy. No over the top action. No cheap looking cgi. This is pure emotion.
So Shang-Chi and Wakanda Forever will obviously be the only good movies of this phase. Happy they can end the year on a good note.
Beautiful trailers
I can't wait!!!
Bet T’Challa and someone Namor cared for/loved died at the same time and it was Atuma all along
I loved M'baku explaining things to his tribe
I wonder how they are going to do His death obviously it’s off screen the movie may start with it have already happened
Can we all agree the soundtracks alone are awsome
My emotions were running high for this trailer and I couldn't be pumped. This movie will definitely be the best of the MCU to date and Chadwick will be proud.
....still don't know.  Namor is looking cooler and cooler tho 🪶🦶
Wow. They gave us some time to cry before. Now we get the tension. What a build!
God I hope she's not the next Panther. I REALLY hope this is her early before Bas strips her for being unworthy. I cannot stomach a world where Letitia's transphobic and anti-vaxx ass gets put on a pedestal
Maybe they're going to pull a Sony and show that scene at the very end of the movie
SO PUMPED!!!!
These guys would cry to the intro to SpongeBob , dramatic ass people
Namor and the Wakandans will friends by the end of the movie
SHURI IS GOING TO SAVE THE MCU!
So pumped for this!
Namor looks amazing 👏
Shuri and Namor looks so dope! 😍
About time mexico gets a important marvel character and who better than namor this movie is going to be 🔥🔥🔥
Shuri rocking her _sneakers._
My Time is 6:47 PM
Namor has the same regal quality as Chadwick Boseman brought to BP. You can just feel how regal they are.
What do you guys think? Recast or not?
i dont like the background it makes me not wanna watch your video
Namor looks so phenomenal.
This looks INCREDIBLE
This movie deserves to win a lot of Oscars including for Best Picture of the year. The cool part is the movie is coming out on November 11 which is 11/11 so make a wish. 11 + 11 = 22, November 11, 2022.
its in the comic book that she becomes BP no surprise
This Might be one of the only good things From Phase 4 Mcu.
Disney is manipulating the loss of Chadwick Boseman (a real human being) to make you feel more emotion about T'Challa (a fictional character). That is heartless and disgusting marketing. I will not be supporting Marvel anymore until they leave Disney.
Shuri’s suit looks gorgeous!! I’m bringing a whole tissue box with me, because I know this going to be such an emotional roller coaster
Team Kulkukan....Quetzacoatl. Whatever....got that blood in me
Definitely shedding tears then
They really put the WINGS on the feet, honestly i dont like it but meh i trust the MCU people
bro this movie looks cool as shit
Awesome trailer.
I love the energy in this trailer. It at least FEELS like top for MCU again cuz it was starting to slag a bit since No Way Home. Like some stuff was cool but it was just okay for a while. Like Greg sound, the sound design on this trailer man. lol
Well definitely not as moving as the first. But that’s OK, this gave us more of a movie summary than a vibe. But man that Namor. If he was born with his powers as a mutant and no intervention with a flower or a space stone or anything else, that would make him the most powerful naturally occurring earth being,
This film is going to be packed to maximum capacity. It's going to be very emotional and such a great movie. I need to have the theatre experience for this one.
What an Awesome Trailer  This Movie is gonna Be incredible and fantastic
It’s Definitely M’Baku
Without a doubt the soundtrack going to be amazing
Okay, Marvel needs to release their trailer music at the same time. This is another bop. WAKANDA FOREVER!!!;
Nomor domination 🔥🔥🔥
The “I have lost everything” line from the first trailer makes me think Shuri will be thought to be dead before showing up as the new BP. Possibly dying from a synthetic heart shaped herb. Would be a gut punching scene if she meets T’challa and Killmonger in the spirit realm. Killmonger could do the talking and T’challa can do a lot without speaking.
😢❤…trailer was soooo good…
Bruh
Can I get y’all autograph
It’s not shuri plot twist
they already comfirmed it was shuri....
What if its Angela Bassett 🤔
Incredible!
Namor looks pretty bad A. In the trailer they mention Kukulkan the Mayan God. He looks awesome with that Mayan King inspired head dress. Great trailer and excited for the movie.
WHERE’S COI
Let’s go!!!
that suit is making me HOT 😍🤤🥵 and feels so right Shuri taking over since her brother is dead, she's youngest and royalty, just her and her mother left in the family, and maybe Erik if he isn't dead I think he is but they can do whatever they want, but don't care if BP is female don't know why anyone cares cause I think this will work out beautifully
Honestly, this is likely going to be one of *the* best Marvel Films, at least in Phase 4.
Who is that in iron man type suit?
This looks like it’ll be better than the first one… I hope it is. I’m pretty hyped!
Bruh this got me feeling some type of way. I really think this will be the best project of this phase. And what a way to end this phase.
The lyrics to the song say she is the female king, the sound track suits her right 🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲 what a song by sampa the great, chef 187 and tio
I don't see how it could, but I really hope this doesn't flop. It looks so emotionally investing and heart pounding, can't wait!
Ngl, I was a big fan with the first trailer. Now I’m a full blown AC unit. I’m definitely seeing this on day one in IMAX!!!
Omg 🙀!!! 🥰❤️
Good morning from Mexico 🤘🏾
the music note for the dora milaje makes me think that shuri is maybe not the one under the mask
Chadwick is smiling down at this RIP king, wakanda forever
It’s entirely possible that Nakia is the new BP.
You guys are great!
the second trailer got me more geeked to go see this!!!
The mask in the poster features dots similar to what Shuri has been seen wearing, which is cool.
Hope they will bring Killmonger for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty 🙄🙃
First time I watched this trailer I got goosebumps and I got Goosebumps again watching this and i screamed when I saw the suit because it strengthens my Shuri Theory
When they mentioned kukulcan, I flipped. Maya's culture is there and I cannot wait to see how Tenoch Huerta would play the character.
It would actually be disrespectful if they fucked this movie up, imo. Glad the trailer looks this good and it’s shaping up to be the best Marvel project we’re getting since no way home.
Looks amazing. Pretty sure I'll watch it if I get the chance. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Namor looks fantastic!!
This will be the most complete movie since End game and so much more! They giving us the most beautiful tribute to king Chadwick ❤
That last part about misdirection and the whole story not being immediately known is spot on.   I’m still holding out for Killmonger to be shown alive and rehabilitated.
Love you guys but GOOD LORD, who's in charge of the thumbnails?? haha
they are going to have this bad ass guy villain then they are going to have 2 women take him down, o He's this powerful but can't handle these two stupid
This movie is almost 3 hours so I HOPE they use that time for story development. I am VERY excited for this
Um actually that’s Mr. Nimbus
so how are they gonna kill him off , assuming tchalla had passed in mcu by the beginning of this movie.
Spoiler thumbnail!🤬👎
This is the first MCU movie I might be scared to see what will happen next, cause it’s both Shuri taking the mantle and how it will lead to the future. Still, I’m going watch the hell out of the movie.
This is fire 🔥 I can’t wait
A new villain/anti-hero. 1 character being laid to rest. A new character taking up the mantle. A war between 2 factions. Clearly a bigger villain behind the scenes. A bunch of new characters being introduced. There is too much going on and with recent MCU movies like Thor 4 and Strange 2 having major pacing issues I don't see how BP2 is going to make this all work. I can only base my opinion off of recent MCU content and phase 4 has been bad. I don't see how Marvel magically turns that all around with 1 film. I hope I'm wrong though. Would love to see a great MCU movie again.
Would be awesome if we have more Native American inspired super heroes. There is so much mystical and mythological material to pick from.
I'm gonna be EATING THIS MOVIE UP LETS GO SHURIII
The King Women-True story PG13- Is like Wakanda movie and more action.
Every time I see a picture of Chadwick Boseman it makes my heart hurt. This movie is going to be so emotional.
Absolutely Amazing🔥🔥🔥!!!
Feel like promotion wise, they see this as a big milestone for the MCU. Pushing it almost at the same level as NWH, but more than Thor and Dr Strange. I'm hoping for definitely the best written movie, and one of the best overall movies in the MCU
Man I can’t believe my eyes I am extremely just ready for this movie now
You can tell Ryan Coogler really cares about the characters and story. This doesn't look like a director who will sacrifice a storyline for some laughs. You can see emotional state he and the writers were in when they worked on this.
I have my 4 tickets in 3D🤤
Looked like Mbaku had the suit early on. Then didn't.  The final was definitely Shuri. I think Mbaku will get the suit, then he will die and Shuri will take it over. Looks awesome
The real question is...considering how woke and anti-male hero MARVEL/Disney has gone recently...if Chadwick had not died, he would've been almost woke-proof and clearly the head of the MCU going forward, or would he? I wonder how they would've screwed him over.
Film looks mesmerizing, can't wait. 😭💔
CGI gotta be better
so this movie comes out on skyrim's 11th anniversary
It's a no from me when you put women in charge everything sucks
Brooooooo!!!!!!! The way Namor looks flying through the air is so fucking smooth!!
I think it’s going to be Okoye. Makes more sense.
It's crazy that they were teasing this war all the way back in Endgame and now we're seeing it play out. Looks amazing
Those thighs seem too thick for Shuri, might be Nakia
That iron man sound. God i miss tony stark.
Not recasting is a mistake. Nobody's asking for Ironheart. Dad bob Namor/Ramon will underwhelm viewers.
Cant Wait For This Legendary Movie 🐐💯❤️
Uggghhh I was hoping it was killmonger
The name of the song is called Never Forget by Sampa the great and I feel like it was just fitting for this movie
And to think that Ryan Coogler is directing Avengers secret war. I can't wait to see that.
I love your reaction! Its surprising that you guys didn't cry this time..
Comic book dreams come true. O boy MCU at its very best 🔥
I find Namor's little ankle wings absolutely hilarious
The skills of previous Panthers  passes on to the next right?!
~ 🙌⛩️🕉️☯️⚛️⛩️🙌 ~
THEY FLY NOW
tbh idk whos the main character here
Namor is looking great. Shuri is gonna be great and Iron Heart looks promising!!
I'm so excited!
Once early reviews start dropping and folks see a critics score of 100%. This movie will go toe to toe with Maverick and eventually overtake it and become the #1 Box Office movie ever. There is so much going on in this movie that will keep people streaming to the theatres week after week. A cinematic masterpiece along with a poetic tribute to Chadwick.
It's Shuri
MCU is pulling everything in BP. Lost but not forgotten T’Challa
I swear I was commenting on another video earlier about the quality an beauty of these trailers . I think it would of even topped the first movie of it wasn't for the loss of marvels king. Everyone working on this film will be on there A game as a dedication to chadwick and his family whilst moving forward I'm soooo excited for this film and it does feel so important I can't wait phase 4 will be at its best . Love from the UK.
It’s Okoye!!! 😂 jk jk but that would be badass tho 🤣
Was that a transformer?
Phase 4 really needs this. Looks like Marvel focused on quality for this one.
Shri 🔥🔥🔥
Nah, they should’ve just left this alone. 🤦🏽‍♂️
amazing trailer !!!!
The sound track is 🔥🔥 congratulations Sampa The Great , I am so proud to be Zambian 🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲🇿🇲
Wakanda forever 🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤
🇿🇲 Zambia ku chalo 🇿🇲
Man tears started rolling down my eyes again 🤦🏾‍♂️ This movie is going to be amazing
Was waiting for your reaction!!!!
Whoa
This looks soooo good! An easy billion dollar movie at the box office!
WHOO!!!!!!  No doubt this movie will be an emotional one from beginning to end, the suit reveal was the best thing I’ve ever witnessed in this trailer!!! We’ll be seated in the king’s honor when November 11 comes around    🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️🙅‍♂️.   Shuri’s gonna no doubt kick ass and take names in this one. Being the sister of royal blood, it’s that obvious that she’ll honor her brother and her people in her own way, as well as Chadwick’s legacy.
I feel this movie needs to win best picture at the Oscars and win tons of awards this movie looks amazing I also feel like this is going to be a huge tribute to Chadwick Boseman. Avatar has no chance of beating this movies box office this is going to shatter a massive tons of records, I feel like Namor is going to tease the X-men and the Fantastic 4
This movie looks like it's gonna take its self very seriously, which is great in my opinion. As much as I love the mcu, the whole jokey feel is getting old. So it's refreshing to see this.   Really hope this movie is as good as it looks.
The music alone is memorable, the flooding of Wakanda I think is taken straight from the comic book page, and I didn't think they would show the Ironheart suite or Namor's winged feet but they did lol.
I need her Hot Toy
If I was a new actor in the mcu I’d only want to be introduced through Ryan coogler’s films
Someone get this man a shield!!
I love how namor flying looks like he’s air skiing, makes his flight scenes different from other characters who can fly
I think it's going to be Nakia.
More serious beats coming from marvel - looking forward to it
WAKANDA TEMPORARY!!
Shuri was a terrible choice for the new Panther.
Looks kinda shity
if it is her is she the avatar of the god seeing they burned all the flowers...
Ryan Coogler might be an actual wizard.
You missed STORM!!! T'challas Mask was in the hands of a veiled woman with white hair. Different style then the others showen with white hair.
Looks like Ramonda is the leader. And recent pics from the movie look like she's training Shuri in combat
Looks great, I think this movie is the perfect movie to finish phase 4, the eye of the storm before phase 5, when things will start to develop towards Avengers Kang Dynasty / Secret Wars.
These trailers have felt very different compared to the other Marvel trailers we've gotten. The raw emotion, the action, the characters...I have a great feeling this movie will be a masterpiece!
Love watching you two ride these roller coasters.
Something very eerie about the Atlanteans here, compared to DC’s take. The way they swarm to the surface, Namor’s throne, etc. plus just excited to see the first Marvel character given life.
I gotta say the music choices for both trailers are just phenomenal. It totally captured the mood and emotions of the trailers and enhance the experience even more.
For me Okoye would make more sense as she is a warrior, whereas Shuri has shown herself to be more scientific and technological, but if they’re really going comic accurate with Namor’s ankle wings then it has to be Shuri.
I'll rent it when it comes out
WAKANDA FOR LIFE 🔥🔥🔥
But it's not Atlantis it is Talocan. They decides not to call it Atlantis because of Aquaman which is B.S..but that is what it is
WAKANDA FOREVER 😭
Namor flies and hovers in place like a hummingbird. Very interesting choice, in the context of his mesoamerican reimagining. :)
The fact that they changed the script to be about grief and lost and how it puts the characters and the people of Wakanda in a weak state is sad but a great message. Wakanda lost there King and protector. It shows that both off and on screen they are hurting and grieving but they will make it through this. I would love if they did one thing with T’Challa like maybe show Chadwick/T’Challa in the Ancestral Plane. Can’t wait for this movie
Namor looks well hard.
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤💯
That looks incredible. I’m glad it’s coming out on Veterans Day so I can see it Thursday night and not get spoiled.
E lacração, mais gostei pra Caraí da shuri, tá foda l, arrepiou
I'll stick to my theory that it's Nakiya.
Wait were she going get her power from killmonger destroy all heart shaped herb I cannot wait to see it
Long Live The King!
Truly Goosebumps and tears at the same time🔥❤️🔥❤️❤️
Wakanda Forever trailers are giving me life.
People: “This new phase sucks.”  BP2: “Are you challenging me?”
This isn't just a movie, this is legacy. This film will shatter the internet like none other. I cried at both the trailers and I know I'll be raining tears in the film. It carries such an emotional weight, it's hard to put into words. Save the date my friends.
In Loving Memory Of Our King Chadwick Aaron Boseman (11/29/1976-8/28/2020), And Michael Kenneth Williams (11/22/1966-9/6/2021), Dedicated To Dorothy Steel (2/23/1926-10/15/2021).
WAKANDA PRA SEMPRE!!!!
probably movie of the year
am I crazy or is that a snippet of the Dora Milaje theme song at the very end of the trailer?
Tenoch!!!! Rip Rey Chadwick!!
These trailers have been brilliant
Best trailer ever 🎉 They teased everything and didn’t spoil any important plot from the movie in this trailer 😇 Waiting eagerly for theatre experience 🥰 and Finally RIP Chadwick Boseman 😞
They didn’t cry!!!! They are evil!!😂
I'm crying again! I'm not one for award shows, but they should create a category just for movie trailers. Seriously, this is one of the best trailers that I've seen from the MCU. It's truly beautiful.
Good Lord, the trailers have me sobbing. I'll be a mess in the theatre. 😭
Ryan Coogler is a beast! The way he directed this movie looks amazing!
I hope that it will be good
The new suit looks just fine. There is nothing wrong with it. At all. Nope. It is OK. It sure is. Yep. ✌
Okoye: "Why are you doing this?!" Namor: "There was an earthquake under the ocean, and you did NOTHING!"
Still think they should have re cast tchalla but this looks really good
God I can’t wait to go on this cinematic journey!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
I can’t wait to cry my heart out while watching this movie it looks so fantastic
OMG, I CANNOT WAIT!!!!
Just preorder my tickets for me and the fam 🙌🏽
Should of recast the blank panther
Right when I woke up I got a notification! It’s gonna be good. Just wish Chadwick would have been in it
MCU is dying. This will be the softest Avengers team ever assembled.
Can I share your video as a reaction video on my channel?
Today was my birthday and marvel was too kind that it gave me this
Doesnt matter how often i see the trailer i always get chills of emotions. Literal goosebumps. Cant wait
The feelings will hit hard with this movie, long live the king, this will be a great farewell for Chadwick Boseman.
Considering the tech involved in the suit, what if Shuri, Nakia, and Okoye all wore the suit at key moments in the film. It seems this sequel is focusing on Wakanda and its people. Maybe the death of the king is a jumping point to explore that.
Honestly, I was most excited when I saw Namor's foot-wings.
I didn't cry for this trailer but god damn
I got so much goosebumps watching this, and looks so epic! Glad to see more of Riri Williams, and knew it would be Shuri, the more logical for now.
This is shaping up to be the best thing to release this phase, alongside Shang-Chi. High stakes & emotional resonance. Exactly what we need! Chadwick would be proud.
You guys should really look into the Patreon scandal right now.
As an international male viewer, I connected more with Chadwick Boseman than I did with Letitia Wright in any of the movies.  I'll just wait and watch if this movie somehow manages to give her a more epic character arc than what we've had so far.
I just hope this will be good because after Thor 4 and doctors strange 2 and she hulk I kind of lose hope for the MCU but maybe this will be a come back.
Suit is immaculate OMG. I cannot wait for this movie 😌
THIS LOOKS NUTS! Ryan Coogler did not come to play
I think it’s nakia very early on in the movie to be a quick replacement! Then will get Shuri later . A true marvel smoke screen 🙊
Stepping at the ruins of Mayan city Chichén Itzá and touching the pyramid made of limestone KuKulKan this brings me so much joy to see it represented in this film absolutely amazing.
This movie is gonna hit way too hard. RIP Chadwick Boseman, the one and true king of Wakanda
At first I was convinced that it was Shuri, but Greg's comment about fighting skills has me thinking it is Nakia in the suit.
I def think the movie will be Wakanda vs Atlantis, but ultimately we will see the person pulling the strings in the background is Dr Doom.
U think this is during the snap ? She say her whole family is gone in last trailer that would explain it
I just know that the beginning of this movie is going to put everyone in tears like Pixar’s UP 😢
I feel like it's going to be the queen, not shuri, she's not a fighter she'll stand no chance against namor
"Feathered-Serpent God" what a badass title, fit for Namor.
WAKANDA NOVEMBER !!! 🙅🏿‍♀️
shame on woke sexist  disney for forcing feminism ( in every marvel movie )  and making wakanda matriarchal by killing tchalla ( he is as important as batman in marvel )instead of recasting him and replacing him with  shuri and make her perfect in everything and better than tchalla in every way without training , wakanda without tchalla is lifeless
Shuri looks freaking awesome. In the comics she’s more feminine but here it looks like a Killmonger inspired suit it’s amazing‼️‼️
did someone see atuma oooh hello this finna be my favourite phase four movie..🙉🙉
I'm not going to be prepared to say goodbye to Chadwick in the cinema. This will hit just as hard as Paul's send off in furious 7
Greg trying hard not to cry
As a fighter, nakia would make more sense
I'm sticking with,  more than Shuri will rock the BP suit. I still think that Nokia wears it at some point.
Now Will See The Difference About Aquaman and Namor I Can Fly
Flying fish wings on his ankles. His flying even pulses like that of a flying fish. Very nice.
I can see why they've picked Ryan Coogler for one of the upcoming Avengers movies. He really must have impressed them with this movie and makes me more excited for this to release!
I don't care about any of the geeky fandom problems because of the story, director and the talent in this movie
shuri is the one!!!
"IN OUR CULTURE....DEATH IS NOT THE END" - this really aged well
I hope this takes place during the blip looks like a good movie
Is it just me or is anyone else excited for November
This ganna be awesome ☺️
comes out the day after my birthday ❤
Chills.Chills.Chills.Chills and Chills.
how does she get her powers..werent all the flowers burned in the 1st movie? or is her suite just upgraded a lot
Pulse pounding! Nice
So, Shuri is the new BP?
Nah man ..not another girls heroes..all the new marvels one been girls lately..n not much hype comin from doin dat...ffs..i miss phase 1..
Knowing what this movie means and remembering Chadwick and what this would mean for him also makes me very emotional. I am very excited for this film and everyone involved. I know it's going to be great and the cinematography is already just amazing.
I’m 100% going to this movie when it drops in theaters
Looks like Shuri is gonna kick ass, Wakanda Forever!
still don't know what will be the cause of death of TChalla in this movie....
Disappointed y’all used that as your thumbnail ….would have been nice to see it revealed on the trailer first 🙄
I cried and ran around the room.
The BGM 🛐🛐🛐
Bigs up to you guys for waking up at 6 am to react to this man lol that’s pretty early
Wakanda Forever ♥️
This will be a legendary movie for a man of legend who passed away too soon ...
Namor looks badass this is going to be awesome
less good reject naaaatiooon😂🥁🥁
I loved this trailer so awesome!
what an amazing trailer gets me so excited for wakanda forever.
Dih-nie Goo-rare-ra
I can’t wait for this film 🔥🔥 WAKANDA FOREVER 👊
I just uploaded my reaction!!! This trailer was absolutely insane!!!!
Dope suit, I would have preferred the superhero landing thought
Imagine there is a twist  regarding who is in the suit???? ...that's why they had no problem showing the figure in it. Anyway getting my tickets Yes that's what I'm saying,  could b someone else in the suit
It could also still be Nakia. But Shuri seems most logical (comic wise)
LETSSS FCK’n GOOOOOOOOOOOOO 🖤🙅🏽‍♂️
Eternal Glory: TAKE IT! IT’S YOURS!!!! 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
sorry but that was a bad choice of thumb nail😞
Wakanda forever 🙅
Love the way Namor fights! They better not kill him off.
Tickets need to come with tissues..just saying.
Shuri will make things right to make peace with her people and the Atlanteans.
Wakanda, a nation with female warriors, won't train their princess🤔
So excited for Namor!!
I'm so excited about this one.  Namor looks phenomenal and the film looks like a beautiful tribute to Chadwick Boseman and his legacy. BRING IT ON!!!
I still think it's Nakia.
I don't think they'd do this, but I really hope they don't kill Namor.  I'm just a little concerned, considering most of Marvel's antagonist characters are dead.
Wankanda Forever !!!!! Brkn ppl leader line!!!! Dope!!!
The trailer looks great, and the plot seems to be taking itself seriously for once. Although this looks great...I'm still remaining heavily optimistic on this movie.
Chadwik have done a great job representing this movie that even after he's gone all the characters and story are still relevant...  Thank you my king  Wakanda forever
I’m going to be honest here….how the hell is Shuri going to beat Namor?!
Wakanda forever
just one wish with this movie to not waste or kill NAMOR off in a single movie, the MCU needs some anti-hero
I’m so excited for Shuri 😭😭😍😍
Just watched it. Excited! Especially to see Ironheart.
Looks incredible!!!
Letitia Wright is gonna kill it I’m rooting for her❤💯
This looks so great, I'm sure Chadwick is smiling down at it. I can't wait to see the movie, the emotions are poured into it it seems!

Interesting that there's been relatively little Nakia across both trailers. Coogler for Secret Wars if he knocks this out of the park?!
So great 😊

What a beautiful trailer. You can feel the music and the action pulse through you, man I’m totally buying my tickets right now.
Don’t like shuris helmet looks bedazzled other than that like the trailer. Don’t know how they’ll address the obvious skill gap between namor and shuri. Hope they don’t make me feel like the skills she has makes no sense in the time she’s trained.
Knew I was going to see you guys reaction to this first!!
I admire your dedication rejects, look at those just woke up eyes 😂
That was beautiful
Damn. Can't wait for this movie to change the course of the MCU.
Part of me is convinced Shuri’s mask is meant to pay homage to both T’Challa’s and her father’s
this raised my excitement even more, i'm super looking forward to the film! november can't come soon enough!
What a way to tribute Chadwick in this fantastic trailer. I really hope this holds the hype and great reaction you guys 👍
