szoboszlai over Mbeumo (liverpool fan😆)
What was your final rank last year mate?
What do you think of Gakpo and Bowen?
Join my league: t942j9
You can't start without Salah.
Is it smart to go for both keepers from West Ham? Either one guaranteed to play and are both cheap at 4.5 & 4.0
"Last year "
I like Ferguson for Brighton, if he can stay fit he will get great service and seems to be a gunman
Who can beat me? code : ibhxgh
I usually start by looking at the games and seeing who has harder and easier games so my forwards are easier games as more goals ,midfielders is whatever and defensively it is harder matches as it will have more defensive in it and goal keepers are just the best I can do. Loved this vid tho
Current draft:  NO TRENT - as an LFC fan is return last season was disappointing. He has to prove that he can play the new position before I pay 8.0 for him. No way right now:  GK Flekken or Fabianski Forster or Areola  DEF - going light here White, Mings, Botman Baldock, Sergio Gomez  MID Salah, MacAllister, Rashford Saka Enciso  FOR Haaland, Jesus, Joao Pedro
I’ll bet RAYA goes to ManU as De Gea is gone
Same team for everybody again!!!1
my solution to the "no good 2nd forward" problem is going Kane. Sacrifices have to be made in the midfield but I don't mind (for now)
why is no one going for Stones or Dias?
Should I copy you every week?
You need at least 2 city players to start with
Havertz was outstanding at Leverkusen as an attacking midfielder/number10. He only ever played 17 games as a centre forward for Leverekusen because of injuries. Forced to player there at Chelsea because of mis-firing strikers and injuries. If he is nailed on at Arsenal in his favourite position with the added experience uptop the last few seasons he could easily be the steal of the season at £7.5m. Could hit 25-30 goals and assists combined. If he is in that position in week one. He is straight in for me. Be deffo keeping an eye on Arsenals pre season.
another great vid Andy 🔥
Nice bit of quick maths at 2:40 😅
Fofana is by no means nailed. He’s anything but. Colwill could easily be starting ahead of him.
Sorry to use race, but your team has more black players and any other else's draft.
Get the goat Maddison in your team
i’m going through the striker midfielder problem, i don’t particularly like the idea of jesus but the current 6.5 million forward i have is evan ferguson, very good player and i believe this will be his breakthrough year, but will he start the season? and i’d have to downgrade the midfield for jesus
Anyone picking John Stones?
Theres so many logic flaws and flip flop reasonings in these videos 😂😅
Saka, Ødegård and rashford or saka bruno and rashford? Maybe saka ødegaard and rashford?
only thing for me is deciding between Mitoma and Mbeumo
Surely Timber has put u off Gabriel now?
hey, did you lose some weight? you look great
Nice new graphics but shouldn’t the arrows be reversed
Am I silly for thinking Richarlison could be a weapon if Harry Kane goes? He had a bad season last year but he ticks a lot of boxes; classed as a midfielder but playing forward, proven performer at his best, could thrive under a new Manager (fresh start) who coaches an attacking style, priced well, and the Brazilian international has a lot to prove.
With the new off side rule I have the sinking feeling Haarling will be even more productive.
Ramsdale,  estupinian, shaw, trippier, saliba,  martinelli , rashford,  mitoma, szboszlai,   haaland , issak thoughts??
Judas! You’re a ffs man! Will still watch tho lol x
Morris dark horse 🐎
2 White players... I haven't watched football in a while. What is with the sudden demographic swap round?
Good to see you back. 8/11 same players in my first draft. You sure only one player from MCI ? I'm going for Ederson (or a defender) and a mid (maybe Grealish) in addition to the obvious.
Mitoma v Gross v March   How do you even decide. I'm currently on gross just because he has a more consistent history rather than one season
If Areola does start and you went with fabianski too it would be annoying as fk having a 4.5m keeper on the bench you can't rotate with. However you can always downgrade fabianski at that point if no other moves to make   If there was a 4m+4m I'd go for it tbh but I will probably end up doing leno+rodak because I don't think any 8m combo exists where at least one plays never mind both. Honestly I think it would be more fun if FPL just set all the promoted teams keepers at 4m lol
Before I watch the video will it have Trent James Chilwell and Salah in. Let's see
Quick maths there at the beginning "9.5mil so 4 plus 4.5" 😂
Waiting for Chelsea to let Maatsen go back to Burnley. He looked incredible for them with around 15+ goals and assists plus a bunch of clean sheets
Reece james and Chilwell at 5.5 are almost a must have imo. Idk why they are overlooked poch is known the make the fullbacks almost the best players outside strikera
Jed spence could be a great player this season
Thoughts on Eze? I’m thinking it’s either Eze or Mitoma
“Meanwhile from open play you’re more likely to get a goal from Rashford”. Yes, but I think you’re more likely to get a return from Bruno. Think Bruno without penalties is a better option than Rashford even without penalties. At .5 less it’s a no brainier to go for Bruno for me.
Im taking a risk with szoboszlai
Do you think ferguson or a 6 million midfielder like Gibbs White
I think we had enough bad FPL performance from Pickford, Sterling and Jesus to know we will not own them in gw 1 ;) no one starts taking punts in gw1 especially not exciting ones. That face when you look at your team gw2 and wonder how the hell you own them 😅
Why dont we talk about rice who is 5.5 and is in arsenal now?
Sterling might get sold so maybe Nkunku looking better.
For now I have Salah instead of Trent for GW1. Plan to add TAA around GW8 and probably drop Haaland for Kane at that time.
who is MUNs goalie?
Why tf would you pick Sterling?
11:14 no guarantee Sterling starts
I’m surprised you haven’t really mentioned Watkins? Unai Emery is doing a job at villa. You think he’s overpriced or?
I prefer isak then Jesus for 0.5m cheaper
No Salah captain? 😂😂 No Ederson!
Sterling isn’t nailed, and can’t hit a barn door
can we get a code for your league please
Odegard outscored Saka regardless of pens, they couldn't price Saka higher.
Kane only got about 10 or so less points than Haaland in a really poor Spurs season team. Feel he's being overlooked. Unless he pisses off to Bayern obviously.
where is salah ??
Henderson man utd if he stays 4.5
Love FPL but can get bit boring always picking the same captain I will defo not be doing that this year
any thoughts on Broja at 5mill?
Right back
Surely enciso + bruno is better than mintoma + sterling
look at that smile!
1 Man City player? Really bad draft buddy
i know man city has alot of rotation so hard to pick their players but the defenders are actually really cheap for next season stones 5 and dias 5.5 so many clean sheets and corner threats
John Stones?
What about Reece James?
Ferguson was an option that was not mentioned over the next three fixtures even if he only starts two I think he will score more fpl points than Jesus. Ferguson growing into the main no9 for Brighton.
Genuinely can’t believe that Estupinan is currently nearly 50% owned.  The fixtures are there but with Caicedo going and Mac10 already gone, don’t see the Brighton defence holding steady when they’re so attacking at the other end.  Really think that Arsenal game has blinded a lot of people, Arsenal were too busy bottling the title!
What about City defender?
I doubt Fofana will start.Chelsea will now play a back 4 and there is a lot of competition.Fofana,Thiago Silva,Badiashile,Chalobah,
How can you see the player opta ?! I renewed the fantasy hub but still most options still not working ?
Why does no one pick trippier anymore??
Is Jackson realistically starting for Chelsea in gmw1 cos for a 7m he’s not a bad about?
So is Zenchenko’s mins at risk?
I have gone no TAA or Salah with James as first sub. Hopefully doesn’t end in tears gw2. I have gone very heavy in midfield. 9m and down only 1 6.5.
This is the same as my team with the excption i have nkunku instead of sterling. I have also been toying with no taa and have james instead (if he can even make it to the start of the season without getting injured) to have extra funds. I am a bit worried that a lot of starting teams will be the same like last year.
John stones seems like an absolute bargain. Near the end of the season he was getting goals and assists and became a starter for Pep and I do think this season Pep will play with the three center backs and two cdms with stones being one of them
Badiashille is probably a safer pick the W Fofana
What about Evan Ferguson at 6m as an option? Have him in my Salah draft.
I’ll go with havertz instead of saka
No Salah this year?😂😅
I've got Trent in most of my initial drafts but the concern really is that he was getting into midfield and being very attacking, but that was when Liverpool didn't have any decent midfield options. Now they have finally gone shopping to (hopefully) fill that massive gap then is Trent going to get those same opportunities? 🤔 Because if not then he probably isn't worth 8M.
Thoughts on money mase Andy?
Thoughts on grealish as a pick I don't think fodens that good
What about Ollie Watkins instead of TAA
Anyone else got Martinelli in initial draft???
Gabriel will probably be nailed for a little bit, but if Timber comes in then there's uncertainty and I think he's the most at risk.
Haaland x Kane link-up?
When/if United buy a striker everyone will drop Trent from their drafts i think
Antoine Semenyo for Bournemouth is a nice 4.5 million forward.
"its a pea man"
trent captain gw2 Andy ;-)
Willing to be £100 you don’t start with Sterling😂
Salah and Mings for Trent and Sterling. The rest is more or less the same
I feel like Alexis Mac is a good pick but any Liverpool fans know if he is nailed?
Surprised at the lack of City players (other than Haaland) given their fixtures.
I think Son could be a dark horse this season now he has had his hernia op I expect him to be back to his best, and will thrive in the new system under Postecoglou. Could be a great differential. The challenge is trying to fit him in to the midfield when there are so many great options.
Good video but why no prices on the players on screen?
I'm going without Haaland and Kane, looking to spread the funds. Saying so I'd love to here you guy 's opinion, which one should I go for between Jesus, Wilson, Watkins and Isak (Who is more nailed to play).
Botman is cheap but fixtures are awful. And as for Sterling...
I'm surprised Andy doesn't have Salah in his first draft! Shocking haha.
seriously leaning to 4-5-1 with TAA , Stones, James and estupinian as starters
Trent 18 pointer incoming against Bournemouth. No big deal if you don’t have salah just captain Trent in gw2 (That haaland guy ain’t a bad shout either)
Is this for this season or last season?😂 not liking the fact that it’s looking very similar
Not sure i can have trent to begin with 8 mil for a not ideal first fixture defender just sounds bad atm.
Why is no one rating Stones anymore?
Why people aren't talking about mount @letsTalkFPL
Wouldn't you rather switch sterling to nkunku? Nkunku should be nailed (sterling has mudryk for competition) and also might be on penalties.
Andy, you are the best. However, picking saka because he has pens and then straight after saying pens are unpredictable so that's why you won't go for Bruno...
where salah!? :)
Brilliant logic. Choosing Saka over Ødegaard cause he takes penalties. Then chooses Rashford over Fernandes at 0.5 less and is on penalties.
Trent out Porro in sterling out son in. Think that works
I’ve currently got enciso and enzo in mine as I feel they could be a couple of hidden gems this years
Sterling well worth a punt
My team right now: Raya Peacock-Farrell Estupinan Stones Roberts Botman Pedro Porro Mbuemo Rashford Odegaard Saka Gross  Haaland Jesus Semenyo  I have 1 mil in the bag and I'm keeping Raya for now but will probably switch to either Pickford or Verbruggen if they prove to be valuable assets.
Having a look for cheap players, anyone any idea why Lockyer and Pelly Ruddock at Luton aren’t on there??
waiting for email verification from Premier League again...same as last year, takes absolutely ages to receive the damn email :(
Richarlison as a 7m midfielder could almost become a must have if Kane ends up leaving Spurs and he takes his place as the main striker
Porro?
36 days until the deadline. 5 weeks of friendlies, injuries, transfers etc yet to unfold. I'll do my first draft after the Community Shield.
What about Foden
Good draft but as a chelsea fan I’m gonna say it right now, mudryk will most likely play more then sterling as he offers a lot more
I don't think you should make a decision on maddison based on last seasons stats. Different team and battling relegation. Playing as a number 10 with Kane and Son to feed off! I'm predicting his attacking output will be huge this season. Bargain 7.5m
TAA scores 52 less points than the 21/22 season but gets an £0.5M price increase 🙈
i like sterling but i really dont trust his minutes will be good, might be 1st choice but definitely gonna have shared minutes with their options
Is Raya valued at 5 million not because that's what they rate Brentford goalkeepers at, but because they expect him to transfer to a top 6 team?
Hi Andy, Bees fan here  Mbuemo will still be RW, with Wissa and Schade playing ST or LW untill we get in another player (Brennen Johnson is our main target) but we are playing 4-3-3 more often now and only 5 back in tough games. Mbuemo will take penalties and is definitely the best option for Brentford FPL wise
Verbruggen TAA/Gabriel/Botman Rashford/Ødegaard/Saka/Szoboszlai/Mitoma Haaland/Nkunku  Areola/Burn/Beyer/Archer
Don't go saka. 2 seasons in a row he's burnt me by starting slowly.
Tempted by Mount if he's gonna start. He'll like be more advanced than Bruno if they both start!
9:57 when they play the 433 against the 'smaller' clubs Mbeumo is the right winger and Wissa is the striker, it then they go to a 352 against the bigger clubs Mbeumo could be the striker with Wissa, (but I don't know whether it will now be Schade ans Wissa as the two up top and Mbeumo on the wing again, I'm not sure yet in that scenario)
Mine is  Ramsdale  Ake, Estupinan, Zinchenko  Martinelli, Bruno, Maddison, Ramsay, March  Kane, Haaland  Areola, Mitchell, Woodrow, Beyer
I think Jota might be a shout this year
No way Stirling will be in your team come start of the season 😂
Glad you are back for real Andy. Bring it on
Hi Andy, thanks for the great content. Is Enciso at $5.5m a possiblity instead of Mitoma? I think he will play #10 and could be a great enabler if he occupies the spaces MacAllister was taking up
Andy, you legend, glad to have your videos back. Roll on the new season!
Apparantly Balogun is wanted by Palace. If he goes there he instantly becomes the best FWD enabler :)
Thoughts on Henderson? is there a chance he could start for UTD this season is there any news of teams wanting him?
Wow that's a big get for FF Hub! Where can I buy their stock? 😅  I actually have James and Chilwell in my first draft (benching one in GW1). I'm a gambler at heart, and I'm stupid enough to probably follow through with having them both come GW1 if by some miracle neither are injured. I also have Salah, who I'd very possibly look to double transfer out to Spurs/Chelsea attackers after captaining in GW2.  I kind of hope Tierney leaves Arsenal, because I find playing CBs so dull and would love to be confident in Zinchenko starting every week.
I took Balogun for 4.5 forward. He will probably leave Arsenal and Premier League club is huge possibility. If that happens he is steal, i will have him unless he leaves Premier League
Enciso train 😅
I know bro was itching for Fpl to come back
Just saying anel in Sheffield going to be a real good asset
Will you be playing PL sorare this season?
Everyone please rate my 1st draft with Salah  Pickford Trent, Shaw, Gabriel, Estu Salah, Saka, Mbuemo, Mitoma Haaland, Solanke  Bench : 4 gk, Botman, 4.5 mid, 4.5 fwd
Feel like I need 6 midfielders 🤣there’s too many good value picks there this year!
Szboszlai?
For me it's debating between shaw or one of Chilwell and James I just feel that I will want to take out shaw after gw3 and that's a booked transfer already bit again shaw is a proven asset while James and chillwell are still doubts. (already have estupiñan and man city defender)
Why are we sleeping on James or Chilwell ?
what about going mount over sterling for gw1 then bringing sterling in for gw3?
My first draft is now fully locked in .... for next couple of minutes
How would your view of Shaw change if they sign Onana?
Does anyone know anything about Nkunku?
I finding it hard to pick a team
Why is points per million not a stat people use?
I prefer Watkins ahead of Gabriel Jesus.  Less likely to be rotated, is Villa’s pivotal player in attacks and was on great form under Emery.
I like the sterling shout but I’m also worried that mudryk playing so well for ukraine and the big money signing will take minutes
been using fantasy football hub for 3 years, its perfect for me
Do preseason transfers count toward your total transfers at the end of the season?
Gabriel is a terrible defender. Every time I watched Arsenal last season he was a mistake waiting to happen.
Im liking the look of madueke from chelsea for 5.5m if he continues starting
I know his team is really going to struggle but as a cheap defensive option at 4m amari bell as a bench option doesn’t look to bad and frees up money for the attack and midfield
Great to see you back, nice draft, no City mid or defence given there fixtures, risky.
I think putting the prices underneath the players would be helpful (pre-season) as a lot of us don't know how much those players are because we haven't even opened the game yet.
I think some tottenham players might be a good option considering their change towards an attacking playstyle.
Great video again. Would you consider doing a draft without haaland as I’m seriously considering if he is just too expensive and if the cost is better spent elsewhere.   You can get the 3 £8M strikers easily enough and the only 2 more expensive are Kane and haaland
I Like that you chosse FFH in stead of scout, I feel FFH does have a easier website than scout.
Pickford Trent, Shaw, James, Gabriel Son, Rashford, Saka, Mitoma, Foden Haaland
Don’t get why people are going without Man City defenders
I want gabriel in at cb but i have saka, martinelli and jesus rn anyway, will wait to see if theres any nice pruces for new signings. Also balogun will be a bargain if he moves club
Go for Stones instead of Trent
how about downgrade Haaland to Kane (save 1.5m)   Saka to Martinelli ( save 0.5m) then maybe upgrade 4.5 striker to Ndiaye at 5.5, upgrade Pickford to Martinez, still have 0.5m to play with
Thoughts on udogie for 4.5M régulion is expecting to leave which only really leaves Davies ange has said how important he will be this season and loves wingbacks cutting the ball into the second six (hidden gem if he gets the place of davies?)
Pedro Porro better in 5.0
Surely with Mount at United Fernandez may go deeper???? Or am I stupid
I think stones is a really underrated option .with him playing in midfield???????
Sue
I  really want Kluivert, but 3-5-2 looks like better value at the moment.
Look at the joy in Andy's face on the thumbnail 😂
(not locked in if course but) Currently on a 3-5-2 and cheap bench:  Pickford (4.5m on pick atm tho), Zinchenko, Estupinan, Shaw, Salah (C), Saka(V), Mount, Havertz, Mbeumo, Haaland, Nkunku  Areola, Bell, Beyer, Simms.
1st 🧑🏼‍🦯
It's first draft time! Right now I think the prices means there's going to be quite a bit of debate about who the best options are - so many players to  choose from! I'm only sure by 1-2 so far 😬
Me
So many choices this season so hard to make a team
Not many people considering de bruyne as a premium, for his price he's up there with players I'm thinking of getting in alongside haaland
First! Love the content!
I better see salah in this team
WE ARE BACK!!
