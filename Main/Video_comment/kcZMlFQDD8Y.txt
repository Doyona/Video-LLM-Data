This show was so funny omg😭😭
Did y’all notice that team 1 didn’t get the chance to steal
Jada be it girl and im like gurl work on your temper😂😂😂😊
Who’s here in 2024??!! I feel like Jada gets the most clout outta being hated so she’s the real winner 😹
with the Valeria thing in this part 9:29 she’s talking about her haters😭 ( she said she’s living a better life than her haters so she’ll just ignore them)
collie wanting to be chill and the main character😭
5:32 andrew 😂
I feel like Jada is a pick me being like to the boys “I don’t like any of them they start drama” even tho she literally was starting it.😂
Gabby is js one of the boys 🥰😜😝
Look like 25 but act like 15 year olds
RAUL AND COLIE DID THAT FOR MEEEEE YESSSSSSSSSSS
gaby and jada js annoy me so much for no reason 😭
My rankings  1. Raul 2. Jayda 3.
Jada is a great host but I don’t like her.
10:49 One of the boys 😜
I hate it but I can’t stop watching this s*it
funny how my name is valeria and im latina too
HOW MUCH I WANNA FKG PUNCH OWEN OMG IDK WHY PPL LOVE HIM 😂
Gaby is the definition of pick me 😭🐖🐷🐻‍❄️
Bro Valeria is irritating me and Sabrina and jadas beef was getting on my last nerve 💀💀💀💀
Gaby is such a pick me
The only thing I learned one that a show is that Valaria is a mean girl
I've watch this show a lot!! Anyone else hate Valaria? Like she's such a bitch..
Wait why did they gasp when she said they had to clean the house? They already said that earlier
NAW SHE SAID IM PART OF THE BOYS
I swear i juwt heard jada say i hope its owne
RAUL GO STUDYY
they shouldve used intellectual questions istg none of them wouldve answered.
This is my third time watching this 😂
why does jada look high
i absolutely cringed when raul and colie kissed..
Im going to have no brain cells after watching the whole series..
6:45 bro they literally said the answer last round haha
OMG JADA IS PICK ME
This is literally Total drama island💀
The only thing I like about Jada is that she doesn't cry so much!
now that i’m rewatching this i’m realizing how much of a pick me Gaby is
na cuz gaby is so pick me “raul cuz im so part of the boyz”
No because I personally feel that Gaby is being a pick me... 😐
I hate Jada
“Sometimes ill look at the comments and get kind of hurt but other times i just have to remind myself that im living the better life and they’re not “   Shut up, once social media hype dies down u will be left with nothing
im sorry but gaby annoying ash talkin bout “i’m one of the boys” pick me 😭
WHY DID RAUL AND COLIE HAS THE DRIEST KISS
I SWEAR RAUL AND GABY ARE MY FAVORITESSS
What is so unfair is how when team 2  got it wrong team 1 didn't get a chance steal but team 2 did when team 1  got a question wrong  AlsO Sabrina and Raul are way too innocent for this show   Love you all and this show is really cringe but so addictive ♥️♥️
This show is so cringe but it’s literally so addicting
Why collie would act shy after the kiss when she was so confident about her turning 18 and "it would be messy" AHAHAHAHA
I sorry but gabby is a pick me 🫢
Tbh I kinda hate Owen
Not Valeria talking abt her haters like they are peasants. Girl PLEASE you are NOT that cool. Get some humility for a change :\
Sabrina and Raul supremacy, that’s that
I was so happy for Raul likes he’s my favorite one and he so innocent and kind.
Alr, to those who like Jada, I’m gonna say this anyways  I honestly think she was being so rude and rlly just a brat. Sabrina was so right when she said that Jada would drop a bomb for no reason and then run away and cry like a baby. Just yell run and cry. And she’s been doing that since the beginning with Gabby too. And the she says sorry and then does it again-? Like girl no-
the gasp i gusprd
NOOO raul is so precious he needs a break damn😒
Raúl is soo innocent
Feel like jada is paid to be scripted
What did colie do? Like “I’m voting her just cause”  she hasn’t started much drama at all jada has started most off the drama and it’s just stupid vote my girl colie on top
This show just attracts pick me's
Bro that kiss was like 20 seconds max😭😂 so cringy and idk why
Valeria is so rude/mean "just to remind myself I have a better life and they're not" that is literally so rude
Bro Gaby is so pick me. “Im still part of the boys.” Girl just say Im still a part of a alliance
I feel bad for jada I cant be the only one that feels bad for her
sabrina is very self centered and the way she responded in the video call.
why raul grab colie’s neck like that💀💀💀
This show is so stupid but so entertaining😭
Valeria is honestly a mean girl and so self-centered
Ima keep hatin on valeria cause shes annoyin problematic and plus im livin a better life than her so she cant chat no offence but shes a pick me
Literally this show is so bad but it’s addicting
“im still part of the boys” -gabby
14:22 Look at collie she a crackhead 😂
Am I the only want who thought that when Julian said “flannel gang” he actually said “flat out gay” lmao
OK but seriously Jada is so obsessed with Sabrina and she keeps ranking her last it’s so funny
“I’m part of the boys”
Anyone watching this in 2022 🤣
17:49 can we all just take a look at how Owen looks like a rag doll 😂
Valeria is so annoying.
I didnt know half of the answers to the trivia questions Lulz 🍗🍗🍗🍗
I’m still part of the boys ‘’ GURLLLLL
Colie is so ANNOYING and so is Sabrina I hate them like get over yourselves
i never liked owen but like... "can i in the most respectful way possible kiss your hand?" 😂 now i like him.
“Raul cause I am still part of the boys” LIKE HAVE YOU NOT SEEN TIKTOK ABOUT PICKS ME HAVE SHE BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCk
gaby is so pick me 😭
“And that my friends is destiny’’ yasss Owen u get it winner!! 🏆 🏅 🥇cuz he does win 😎
gaby kinda a pick me raul thriving tho respect for that man for still studying
honestly Jada is actually really pretty. I feel like shes being painted kind of incorrectly but i'm just glad she went out of her way to apologize to colie.
Owen pisses me off someone kick that lil boy
14:20 bruh- is colie on crack?-
17:37 They we’re getting into it frrr
I find this annoying and cringe but i live for drama
honestly Colie is really annoying but she seems like a great friend cuz she ranked all the girls highest and she isn't being mean unlike everyone else- she's just cringe but still
I’m crushing over Owen so hard omg
Here I am again 🥲
Actually I don't think colie is that problematic. C'mon girl just wants sugar and she'll be alright.
me just casually skipping the entire  show just to see the drama-filled parts
Omg no when they played the game
jada is so problematic bruh
Jada doesn’t deserve to be here she caused a lot of drama
Gaby is a pickme
Why does Raul like Chole/Cholie I don’t remember but man you might not be my favorite anymore 😑
Clan the house: Raul, Sabrina, Gabi, Colie: Sorry you said only kitchen right?
Raul : Trust me I am gonna get them back trust me on that AND HE NEVER GOT THEM BACK BACK ABAHHAHAHAHAH
*owen puts raul in 8th place  *friend aggressively yells at computer
''i just have to remind my self that i'm living a better life and they are not'' please can someone tell that little girl that she's such an idiot, thanks.
I legit only respect Raul but my god that dude kisses like he's kissing his mom or some shit, truly a terrible kiss
Honestly stan Raul
Owen is a suck up and I really don’t think he should’ve won because he’s just terrible
This show is too addicting- 😐😐
im sorry but gabi is a whole mood.
Is it just me or Raul is the only truly genuine person there? Although I feel like Sabrina is just really chill and I do like her much more compared to the other (yes I know about the fight but overall she is not trying to create drama just my opinion)
are we not gonna address how colie lied about hooking up with raul???????? i’m so confused
Wait can't they just watch this when they are there because they have their phones to watch it  Like ik it's scripted but like ...... What's the point
“Who does griffin Johnson diss in ‘convenient’?” “Noah and Dixie”  “What is the name of Griffin Johnson’s diss track?” “HoLLyWoOd”  The only thing these guys are influencing me to do is to stay in school
Sabrina always has such an attitude like chill
Why about topper?
Raul looks like shawn mendes
Owen is like that one girl in school that thinks she’s the Center of attention and that every cares what he thinks but in reality no one cares
Bro I hate jada so much she’s so annoying and always acts like the victim
Valaria is literally a pick me girl
If yall feel dump just know that they exist
This show passed and broke the cringe meter
This show is mega cringe
I feel so bad for Jada
Owen is low key crushing on Raul, I’m telling you.
Raul is king
i’m 13 and i clean my room by myself 😃✋🏻 bye what kind of “adults” live like this??? trash everywhere???? might as well just love at the dumpster like wth
these fights seem really script
No offense to Jada but she always comes out of nowhere starts drama,runs away,cries and act like the victim
the fact that theyre so proud they know everything about tiktok and it's shallow culture is so sad and them being so grossed out by cleaning the floor is so embarassing
I actually like colie. She’s so sweet and just being herself
some of the answers to the questions werent even right
honestly i'm just here trying to annoy myself by watching colie 💀
WHY AM I STILL WATCHING THIS IT'S SO ADDICTING😭
Cringy moments check
I love how last nights ranking has Gaby and Raul at the top. Along with sabrina they are probably the most unproblematic in the house
My nan died and this show helps me get through it, we used to watch this together when she was unresponsive in hospital. She asked to see me before she died but I couldn't handle it and watched this instead. I'm 11.
It’s sad that after the show ended Julian tried to break sab and coop up lmao
It’s the breathing exercise for me 👀
What intill topper finds out he is going to kill him
OMG NO OWEN IS GETTING ON MY LAST NERVE
raul only has one personality trait and that is studying
14:22      …Miss Colie are you okay?
I love Gabby she's fine
Do something with your lifes.
🥴
No one is talking about how gaby is a pick me with the boys yet the lied to her!!!
This show is showing some influencer's true colors, most of them are bratty bitches anyway....
I love this I can’t stop watching
Valerie thinks she all that but girl you aint
gaby is such a pick-me girl
Who was that guy on the thumbnail?
Rauls a little fruity 🤪
9:48
bruh i love raul. 100% respect him
Y’all think gaby a pick me when she just said “I’m still with the boys” it’s not like they didn’t ask her first to be in the allowance and it’s a competition why wouldn’t she take the chance
Gaby gives fruit cup vibes just sayin🌚
To the young people who dead ass follow this “iNfLuEnCeRs” please have original thought n don’t just aspire to be a internet idol there’s much more out there,, but mr Alex warren advice is super flawed yes the people who simply support you do matter more then haters BUT people who support you can also just simply be supporting bad behavior or ass content with u, just cause they follow you doesn’t mean they qualify as positive proof your doing well or whatever, you need self reflection n too assess if you really doing your best
OMG YESS GABY AND RAUL DESERVE 1st PLACE
after that kiss wit raul and colie. im most def finishing this show.. im have to push forward doe
I thought collie was annoying and all that but Jada is the one who starts most of the drama, she needs to go
gaby literally is so embarrassing.. “still part of the boyzz🤪🤪🤪🤪” girl they dont want u.. go hype the girls tf
Love how Valeria is supposedly the leader yet she talks the most trash behind people's backs
bro why am i so excited to see them kiss, i hate myself.
SHE REALLY SAID SHES PART OF THE BOYS IN DONE 10:52
I love gaby
I'm late watching this but new season is better and more put together
Bro the house would've been so much cleaner if they weren't lazy , I love cleaning . This makes me cringe sm
Gaby thinks she all that she's such a wannabe like she kept saying "the boys" like girl sit down 🤦🏾‍♀️
a facetime call with alex……rlly
Colie has no brain cells fr lmao She addicted to sugar mannn
What in the heterosexuality-
Is it just me or does Owen sound and talk like that roblox youtuber called hyper
Not owen dying
I cant wait to edit this!😜
14:33 Me in my bed rn: 💃💃💃💃
i wish they didn’t script it bc jada is a nice person but they make her look fake if anybody’s fake its gaby in my opinion bc she turned her back on the girls to be one of “the boyz😈🥶🥵”
bruh I just wanted to broom those Doritos off the floor 💀
My respecr for raul bc he always has to touch the boys arm to get their attention
Not Gabby saying she is one of the boys 💀
Jada have a potential for hosting
CringenessTV hi how are ya
no bc i’ve watched less than 2 minutes of this-  why is it so cringy😭
Colie reaction to Raul saying kiss had me weak😂
Raul is so adorable
wtf jada is just causing all the trouble
Owen needs to just like stop-
this is so bad it’s addictive
This whole show be like                    CoRoNaViRuS wHo?
I’ma be honest with y’all.. I feel Jada is the realest in there, hear me out, when you think about she has a whole reason to be mad Sabrina say there and said everyone in the house thinks she is a b*tch like for Its hard on Jada being the only black female there and not having someone to turn to besides Gabby who said herself she doesn’t trust no one.
sway house was made in 2019
"YOO I hate this show."
did gaby really say “im still part of the boys” …girl
Gaby isn't loyal to Jada, poor Jada is beefing with everyone and Gaby isn't standing up for her. She's mean!
This is my second time watching this oop
Ofc Jada had to be scripted as the “angry black girl” stereotype makes me so mad
Raul did not want to kiss her lol.. peer pressure
14:166 says kiss but makes out
gaby is such a pick me girl i swear
The kissing scenes were sooo cringe.
Dude like ngl Gaby gives me pick me girl vibes but like a nice pick me girl not the rude ones
JUST ME WHOS ADDICTED TO SABRINA AND VALERIA
14:34 I CANT STOP LAUGHING, THE TIMER HE POINTED TO ISNT EVEN GOING
No offense but Raul talks so fucking slow..
I’m done with this show 🏃‍♀️💨 istg Jada is the only reasonable one for walking out 😭
WHY ARE THEY CHEATI G HAHAHAHHFSJSH💀💀💀
17:50 Owen thooooo 😂😂😂😂 what’s goin on man
i need to go to bed
Jada is honestly my favorite because she’s cool and starts drama but istg this show is SO SOOOO fake..
VALERIA IS SOOOOOOO FAKE
Personally I find Jada is the best one there alyah only hating cus she's the prettiest
Raul
Sabrina rlly be like I will rank julian first because of the challenge and he cute.    Jovani: Bruh we twins we look the same
ITS KINDA FUNNY HOW THEY ALL PICK ON THE BLACK GIRL ALL THE GIRLS DNT LIKE THE BLACK GIRL SO RACISTS
Mad cringe but...
I love Raul man
The way I know colie died when Raul choked her
i just watch these episodes for drama but bro why is litteraly NO ONE talking abt 2:24 OML his twin brother said *pff no one cares* IT MAKES ME SO MAD ISTG I WANNA SLAP HIM RN
Welcome to the worst show
They’re okay with seeing girls kiss but when a guy wants to kiss another guy they’re going to be homophobic 🤨
raul..bruh why you so innocent and cool
How is that house so messy. “What are we? 12?” Based off the state of your house you are lol
raul looks like shawn mendes
sabrina and jada kissed on the lips so the rules shouldn't have been bent for owen and raul
Don't like Valeria or whatever but her saying "I just have to remind myself that I’m living the better life and they’re not" cuz she's right lmao, that's a diss for her antis so it makes sense why she said that. Overall, she's still eh for me.
Sabrina put Julian in first and he put her in LAST LOL 🤭🖐
Not gabby being “one of the boys”
gaby said she apart of the boys.... uh anyways
shakes in covid
Valeria is so full of herself,whitewashed to
Get Owen the Hell off of this thing- My mans did not just do Raul like that smh ( 10:14 )
3:32 lmaooooo hahahsh
Nah because I'm pisssed how they scripted Jada as a stereotype of an "extra black girl". Like valeria is the true bitch.
When jada landed on Owen he said the truth for know
Why tf do they have theirs hand behind their back while kissing?😂
I love how much Raul seems to hate ranking people he deserves to win
Did this just happened during corona
i dont even know why im watching this
GABY and jovani I ship lol💖
Sabrina is SUCH A QUEEN
VALERIAAA is ssoooo terribleee
most of these "influencers" are terrible influences
Wait who kissed who?! 14:54
The fact that sab has a boyfriend know it’s so funny
My parents would never let me do the show shout out to there chill parents.
All the girls are dressed in like bikinis except for gabby, give her some respect she looks like she isn’t trying to hook up with the guys.
I love this season
everyone except for sab and raul I literally cant stand lol
Owens shirt reminds me of Eleven in stranger things season 3 🤭
So no ones gonna talk about how mess  the house like how can u live there
No cause why am I obsessed with this show
That was the most narcissistic thing I have ever seen
Owen's a literal 11 year old i'm done
“I’m still apart of the boys” man gaby is just not like other girls😍😍so quirky lol
Owen's reaction to getting 5th place is unacceptable he is acting like a literal 7 year old. Why is he even here?
Raul is the only reason I’m still watching this
whos here after drew gooden lmao
If I was gabby and someone said I was the prettiest in that sympathy way I would be hurt as hell
Lmao Owen sucks, why would he do that?
Why I'm I here watching this cringe 😬
istg owen is in the sun all day and he still looks the same like what
Bro Raul is like high key cute
WHY DID NO ONE BELIEVE WHEN JOVANI SAID GABY WAS THE HOTTEST 😭😭😭😭😭wtf
"I'm StiLl PaRt Of tHe BoYsSS" - Gaby  Literal definition of a "pick me" girl lmaoo
11:58 “We have to keep the boys on top ALWAYS“ bruhhh
as a teen, i hate teens
14:21 All that sugar is getting to Colie’s head 😳
This has to be staged
AHAAH  14:21 WHAT IS COLIE DOING
Is anyone cringing rather whole time?😬
valeria is literally so weird what makes her think that she is living a better life than us i mean girllll-
The gay vibes I got from this video
bahahah Raul was so flustered after the kiss
I'm not a tik tok user but I'm just watching this before my tik tok addicted friends find this  ಠ,_｣ಠ And I'm rooting for Jada man And Owen is okay for me, idk bout you guys, guess I like cringe behavior ಠ ͜ʖ ಠ
Why am I watching this 💀
Who do you pick Are you in the hot tub like your friend that’s wrong I miss your own person and your own
14:21 is no one gonna talk about colie 😂 that girl is tweaking
Jada has attitude all the time when did sabrina have any she just mad like f u jada
not trying to hate  she so mean at the moment like we get it i need a food stamp and you live in a mansion
Owen looks ten or 13
Owen looks like Jacob sartorius and lil tay mixed together
OWEN IS PURELY NARCISSISTIC
"and the entire thing just BlOws Up" well no shit sherlock its a BALLON.
i love how the girls can kiss each other so easily and the guys are just uncomfortable
Don’t they have a sweep or something. CUZ THEY DON’T KNOW HOW TO CLEAN 👁👄👁
okay but like raul's hand placement
Sab was such a uwu girl in this show
i hate colie
Gjwjwgjsysjs
14:20 collie is terrifying
Valeria's bikini is making me anxious 🤧😭✨
The girl who kissed Raul is so lucky— -me, a Raul simp
Am I the only one who loves collie? She's a riot
14:20 DID HOMESGIRL JUST HAVE A SEIZURE?
Valeria is such a pick me girl
what is the point of the rankings when they literally do NOTHING
This is so cringe I cannot 😂😂😂😂
Homegrl really said that she’s into MANIFESTATION SHNSJS GRL U MEAN MEDITATION ??? CAUSE THAT DIDNT LOOK LIKE MANIFESTING to me like HUH? xD i’m embarrassed. this is why I hate every tiktoker that all of a sudden claims that their “spiritual” nowadays. y’all don’t know shitt, most likely get all their recourses & information from yts on tiktok that also claim their spiritual lol & yes i’m being bitter idc this bitch stupid
Wow this is messed up but I think Raul gabby and ownlen is the calmest
Admit it , it's entertaining
colie is not the worst HAHA she makes me laugh
Jada relly said nevermind.
27kGoldn I'm dead💀💀😂😂
Please excuse my thickness but how does any of this make you a "famous influencer" 💀
Owen definitely stands out than the others for me. dunno if it's the screen time though
thay hotsauce so good bro
12:57 total gay moment😳
BROOOOO sab over here ranking julin high when julin ranking her so lowwww like what the helllllllll...
The host had a haircut in episode 3 now he grew his luscious locks again
this is cringe but i like it, and tbh Raul is cute af
Y’all def did jada wrong with pushing the angry black girl stereotype. I don’t like that😐
Owen's like Jacob Sartorius during musically days istg I can't unsee it😩
this is fake as f**k cooper is your BF 14:33
They make the only black girl start the drama like 🙄
I just found this series and I will probably finish it lol it's so juicy
Gaby looks like Mae Whitman :0
Water has more flavor then these tiktokers personalities-
9:33 Dang that hurt my poor self
I knew that when I saw jada and Sabrina kiss I was in the right place and I was summoned
"im apart of the boys im so tuff" *PICK ME PICK ME PICK ME*
Hes first bec hes CuTe
u rlly can see how scripted jadas drama is cos shes so chill here
can we talk about how one of the twins said man up after owen kissed raul's hand??? i can smell the toxic masculinity
wait... these are their trivia questions?
I’m sorry but the breathing exercises 💀 cringe
Owen is annoying
Owen really gets on my last nerve
I hate Owen. He literally cheated in the challenge. I would’ve said something like f u Owen, because they had no choice but to lose.
Them: *having fun blowing up balloons*  Me: *disgusted by the spit flying out from the balloon when it pops because we’re in a pandemic*  🤢🤢🤮
Something is in the sugar, it definitely is doing something to Colie... 14:21
Am I the only person that has literally never seen these ppl on tiktok 😐
“That girl has no brain cells” “part of the boys” gaby is such a pick me
Jada annoying
"Next big influencer" with no personality lmao
14:32 so aggressive for what?
Idk if it’s the editing but y’all fr making Jada look like a bad person.
tbh, I love how honest Jada is bc she can say it straight up to ur face, and not b fake, but she’s kinda problematic- no offense.
I only stan; Gaby, Sabrina, and obviously RAUL!
i swear raul is such a moodd
It's like teen love island but cringier
It's like teen love island but cringier
straight people playing kiss or truth smh
13:26 there not holding a grudge anymore so we shouldn’t hold one against them either
americans are so dramatic. they nearly started crying because they had to clean the house.
owen reminds me of morgz
I am so confused on what kissing or really any of this shit has to do with being an influencer.
12:55 , 16:36 ahhh yess my cup of tea✨👁👄👁👌🏻
I feel like the LEAST problematic is Raul
This is literally just Drama    and Raul.
The only one I like is Raul LMAOOO
The “I hope so” reminded me of that meme
No hate to Sabrina but ummm... ur not being the bigger person... jada LITERALLY apologized...
Why am i on freaking episode 4
Y'all need to stop hitting the woah😂
I don't see the hype with Sabrina
Team 1 should’ve got a chance to answer the question that team 2 got wrong because that what they did when team 1 previously got a question wrong
Gaby was nervous when Jovani asked her!!
Was anyone else super confused the whole video 😭
Can we talk about how they scripted the only non white as the villain.
Owen's whole personality is so cringe no offense and sorry not sorry.
Colin & Sabrina are like those best friends that are really annoying lmao
Colie: I was gonna get on him 😎 Valeria: RAUL COME BACK! 👁👄👁
this show is doing jada so wrong bye
Why does Alex remind me of a blond David dobrik
I only watch this because it’s a free circus I can attend 🤩
owen is so awkward he needa grow up but i cant believe these people are considered "adults"
jeo: "I didn't kiss anyone I hate this show"
Jeo ain't gonna steal his brother's girl away from his brother
14:19 - 14:23 IS KILLING ME-
this is so bad its addicting
I’m  to gay for this shit
Colie seems like the girl who would bully me during middle school
Cringy asf
TBH these competitions are Soo lame
Can alex get some lip balm???? Like wtf
It literally is a contest based on teenagers' addiction to the internet and social media. It is so irresponsible to create that kind of entertainment show, this just encourages them to do stupid things and act irresponsibly.
Aside from maybe Jada and Gaby, the other girls are some of the fakest girls I've seen in a competition show
Something is off about Valeria, she seems so shady from the ep’s. I’ve watched
Everyone did jaida dirty
ah yes, the fan service no one asks for.
Bad acting
Gaby bossy
What the f happened to collie (idk if spell that right) at 14:20
Valeria is so pretty
WHEN I TELL YOU I STOD UP AND DID THE F****NG RENEGADE WHEN RAUL PICKED KISS GIRL I MEAN IT(why am I so dedicated to this show🤌)
Bro all these people are so toxic lmao
Valeria gets on my nerves because she thinks she's all that
Okay, but Raul is the most relatable here.
Jada is a WHOLE BITCH
Why do I keep watching this tho
owen and coline or however u spell her name, they make me wanna kms-
None of them has boobs xd
6:37 team A’s question already said the diss track was “convenient” can’t they at least listen?
i did not just watch this for an hour
14:22 why did colie just glitch lmaooo
I love how they say “the sway house was founded in “ as if it is some very important historical house that was discovered. Lmao pls-
BRUH HOW LONG DID SABRINA AND THE OTHER GUY KISS-
12:57 gurl what-
Raul is the cutest oh my god
Raul is probably going to win if they keep putting him on top lol
10:39 girl bye. 😭 we know you picked her because you had beef with her
12:58 dont lie gaby 😃👍
12:28 💩🐹🐭🐭
raul is my favorite, hands down
They very much give me childish vibes
This whole show gives me second hand embarrassment💀💀
Raul and gabby are my favorites
honestly the only two people i like are alex and marisol-
i love gaby
Is anyone here not on straight tik tok
I hate jullian
Imagine their parents watching this...   👁👄👁
colies back be like this ) the whole time
I’m more mature than them and I’m 14
Gaby is such a pick me “I’m still one of the boys” girl bye-
Sabrina and Collie are gay let’s be honest
Raul kinda looks like a young Shawn Mendes
love ya raul you’re like the least toxic person in this shit show but buddy you are not a good kisser lol
i don’t like how much everyone hates on jada girl leave her alone y’all should be hating on valeria
Why owen so disloyal to the boys
valeria is so annoying omfg i’m happy that she didn’t win
pls tell me what this girl was doing 14:20
Owen cheated in the game you can’t do that
This is for 12 year olds
Lol Valeria gave me rich girl vibez when she said “ I just remember I’m living the better life than them “ 😂😂😂😬🥵
Valerie gets on my nerves so bad...
"One of your braincells just fell off" i died
Owen type of kid everyone bullies in school.
Sabrina honestly my fav lol
Am I the only one who kinda doesn't like Sabrina..her attitude.. maybe it's just me .idek
I promise if this is scripted ima cry. Cause Im watching this instead of the Superbowl. So  can this show get any worse?
😍🐭
why do I feel bad for Jada
Sabrina is honestly the best and she tells the truth and should win...jada is starting drama..what’s new?
I'm sorry but why does Owen look so white/american
DONT BE DISCOURAGED YOURE NOT ALONE IN YOUR SUFFERING . YOU ARE FORGIVEN . YOU ARE VAULABLE JESUS IS HERE  FOR YOU . HE IS THE REASON . HE IS THE MEANING . HE IS LIFE . JESUS LOVES YOU COME TO HIM AT ALL TIMES. HE CARES FOR YOU MORE THAN YOU MORE THAN YOU KNOW .
@14:21 colie hon... stop eating straight sugar.
“One of your brain cells fell off” I literally died bro
This is basically the unknown side of tiktok lmfaooo
Y did Julian say gabby though instead of Sabrina
This show is so dumb yet...so entertaining, idk if it's just me but I love me some drama and romance 🧍🏾‍♀️
AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO DOESNT LIKE OWEN!!!!
Owen I literally hate him
THE FACT THAT HE THOUGHT OWEN WAS LYING BUT OWEN ACTUALLY VOTED ALL THE BOYS LAST *CHILE*
raul deserves better than being on this show
Raul reminds me a little if Shawn Mendez
Butttt doesn’t sabriana have a boyfriends
Bruhhhh nahhhh val and sab pls stop with the pot stirring 🤚😭
ok, but does Valeria ever not do the double hand hair flip?
they do know what hookup means, right? It isn’t just kissing... 😳
Anybody noticed that twitch Colie did during kiss or truth, when Sabrina went. Its 14:19 - 14:21 lol
this is addictive ngl
I THOUGHT RUAL AND COLIE WERE ABOUT TO GO A T I T
I, sorry but everyone in this house besides Raul thinks their all top shit 😭 I’m sorry but hun ur not pls sit TF back down
How is jada creating drama by trying to squash it??? Stop blaming everything on jada
owen annoys me so fucking much idek why
5:43 the face and attitude she gives is like "your correct" now fuk off
Valeria is so toxic!!!
Like Jada is so childish its so annoying she just comes into the and is like collie is doing Owen "dirty"
Am I the only one who thinks Raul looks a bit like *Shawn Mendes*
“I’m living a better like and their not “  girl influencers wouldn’t be nothing if normal people wouldn’t look at their videos soooo yeah :)
Colie is the girl that would say "i have a boyfriend" when you would just ask her for a pencil-
Gaby is the type of girl to say Im pArR OF tHe BoYs
sabrina really gave off bad bitch vibes she was so slept on ngl 😩
raul and colie= biggest ship
I’m sorry but I really don’t like valeria because the way she said “I’m living the better life and their not”🙄like just because you have a little fame doesn’t mean anything
Everyone understand that Jada’s part is scripted. She even said it herself. Awesomeness TV basically made the only person of color a stereotype and this show basically racist.
No one is talking about how Colie is only eating sugar packets. Yeah, she’s annoying but she needs to eat.
owen is the rudest person ever. like he playing 3 girls. when they were in the hottub he said he chose gabby for sure when he diddnt. he is overall a huge jerk and if anyone disagrees the well agree to disagree.    p.s tho your a loser if you agree with him
Valeria just seems so rude irl like you can tell this is scripted but she’s really annoying
Is it on purpose that they made jade the most hated and causes drama out of nothing or are they making her do and say all that stuff ?
When collie and Raul were kissing I didn’t know Raul had it in him Chile I was shoooook-
Episode with the girls kissing yet no sus at all ....
This is actual stupid cringe 😻‼️ the show is full of dumb drama and a bunch of stereotypes. The only person I like in this is the kid who’s entire personality is based off of him being a medical student 🧑‍🦲 that says a lot💃💃
Out of all the brown girls they had to get Jada which makes black girls looks so bad how she represented herself especially when she’s the only black person. Like cmon
Idk if jada tryna make the show more enertaining or if she’s actually that thick in the head 😭😭
Sabrina-Everyone thinks your a bitch Jada-Ok then everyone say it im a bitch
Bruh he twin was like “ima give other people a chance” ranks his twin first like always🤨
This show is cringe but I can't lie it's interesting
No one   Gaby: iM sTiLl pArT oF tHe bOyS
I honestly think Owens team shoulda been eliminated bc he took the cards from Gabby and won that seems a little unfair to me
7:00
Owen is just so overconfident and cringey
The second kiss was the worst i ever saw in my life😭😭😭😭
Collie is honesty super annoying.
What is the name of griffin's diss track "Imma say Hollywood" The question before: Who did griffin shade in his song convenient   *bruh*
Owen has such a baby face
was the bottle also paid or??
Raul: “Nicole”. Raul: “NO I MEANT COLIE”  LMFAOO 😹
Am I the only one that thinks colie isnt annoying-
okay but when they started making out🦋🦋🦋
We hooking up now ok 🥵
I like how all the guys leave b the girls are screaming supporting each other lmao
jada: Sabrina is in 8th place because I feel like she had a little attitude  like bruh you have so much attitude I wish you never came in the first place.
Jada is so fricking annoying
Sabrina is the kind of person who wins and is shocked she wasn't even trying
Honestly tho I ship Julian and sabrima
Why thet acting like have a face time with Alex is like a FaceTime with God
I don't know any of these people they all seem annoying
1741
HAHAHA COLIE HAS ME DYINGGGG WHEN SHE TWITCHES SHE ACTUALLY SEEMS LIKE A REALLY FUNNY PERSON HAHAHAHA
Raul had my whole heart omg
Ammm...y'all kissing and stuff but it's a pandemic thoo soooooo
DUDE CLEANING THE HOUSE???? ARE YOU FOR REAL???? I COULD DO THAT EVEN IF I WON AND STILL HAVE TIME TO RELAX IN THE POOL LIKE THAT'S NOT EVEN A BAD PUNISHMENT
Raul is the only one i like
They need more diversity in this game show 😐 it looks plain and boring
JADA IS STUNNING BUT PROBLEMATIC ASF
GABY WTF. YOU ARE NOT THE BOYS.
I honestly feel bad for jada
God bless, Jesus loves you and died for you all
I feel like Jada is the token black girl
Am I the only one who sees that Jadas “abs” are contoured on 😐
14:20 colie 😶😶😶😶🙄🤔😶
So.. Speaking of addiction :)
Can someone tell me who is this alex guy?
Just use a vacuum...
Just because something isn’t against the rules doesn’t mean it can’t be cheating. Is it morally right? NO.
Why do people say Jada is pretty tho? I mean all the girls are but why they have to point out Jada especially?
I hate it but i love it lmfao
What did valerie do
tf i never kiss a girl but these guys are kissing eventhough they are not dating lol
Raul's nervousness is cute😂❤
*the fact they don’t know who made such an iconic song 🙄*
OMMGGGG THAT'S GAY 😳😳😳
I never hated 3 white girls in my life 😭😭☠️
When they were breathing before the game like wat is thisss hunnyyy😭😭🤚🏾
Alex is wise af. Like Buda wise😳👀
9:30 wow that's I- am jealous.
.......what kind of trivia is this?  O_o
Raul looks like shawn mendes
i lost several brain cells while watching this
ok i’m addicted
It's gabby struggling while reading for me
one thing I really dislike is how the twin brothers are basically cheating. they’re literally voting for eachother when it’s a competition. i get that there can be an alliance but the fact that they’re brothers makes the situation better in order for them to win.
Alex looks so stinky lol
I think colie has crack in does sugar packets she uh a bit uh-
These are the people I think are pretty chill and seem nice: Raul, Gaby and Sabrina
why does Owen act like a 6th grader 💀🤚
MY EYES
Not spin the bottle
I’m living a better life and they’re not? She’s not an influencer she’s an airhead like the rest of them
Sooooo they DON’T do chores at home I assume?
they are so mean to gaby
16:38=GAY
Valeria:let’s play kiss or truth  Corona:fools making urselves easy targets
10:53 not “the boys”
Owen reminds me of a middle school boy.. 🤭
owen and colie are Literally the worst 😏
i hate jada.
gaby keeps talking abt how shes part of the boys and its getting real annoying lol
who's here from courtreezy-
Funny how the three blonde girls qhere exactly what i thought they would be when i first saw them. They really **mature** for instigating problems and keep on at it while its been talked out between the people that are fightingg.... girl who are you calling immature.....
Guys don't hate jada
Am i the only one who wants to kiss Jada
Honestly jada’s the whole problem
owen kinda gives me middle school boy vibes lmaoo but raul so innocent it makes my wanna cry
ya'll sleeping on sabrina. Shes real, honest and she confronted jada when jada was being a bitch. lf l were there sabrina and chloe would have been the only people l would've trusted.
the 2 most annoying are Owen and Colke
Owen gives me 12 year old boy vibes lol
I ONLY LIKE SABRINA ORVWHAT EVER HER NAME IS
yes colie is trash
Y’all stupid for expecting people tv personality the same as their real personality reality tv is scripted especially awesomeness tv many people that have been on their shows has said it’s scripted so leave jada alone
raul leave the show and follow your med school dreams!!
i thought Jada would pick truth i feel like she lowkey hated sabrina guess im wrong
Ahh i wish i was sab so lucky she is with julin he is soooooo cute
What in the pick me
When Gaby said Colie had no brain cells, I WAS IN MY DEATH BED😭😭🤣🤣🤣
Not me hoping for Raul and Owen to kiss only to get a kiss on a HAND
Owens pressed Sabrina said he was like her brother because he keeps putting her at the very bottom lmao
This is soooooooo funny because they’re so fucking dramatic and toxic. Who they influencing lmaooooooo
Colorism is at its finest why tf would u out 1 black girl in this lame ass YouTube show and nothing but Hispanic/Whites that’s soo lame
i feel sorry for whoever watches these with earphones
Raul is cute ngl, also he has a south African accent...
WHY IS THIS SHIT ENTERTAINING, IT'S SOOOO BAD
Valeria: I'm living the better life and their not Me: GIRL BYE LMFAOAOO I rather be a nobody then being the bootlegged version of Bobo the clown.
um.. no ones talkung ab how they are literally KISSING in a pandemic...
jada is mad cringe omg
It was so hilarious when they kept taking photos and recording when they kissed lol
Is colie single
sad they portray jada to be the bad guy... they isolate her from everything, anyways.. she’s the prettiest PERIOD.
a couple of things:  isn't it funny how all the girls are skinny  wheres the diversity - one colored girl and one Latina  how are you gonna determine the next influencer by a couple of little games and not do actually influencing challenges the amount of editing they do to make people seem meaner than they actually are.
Is it just me or does Raul look like Shawn menses wtf
why so easy questions tho
THIS IS INSPIRED BUT WE NEED TO GET THE WORD OUT ......     Raul is to INNOCENT for this 🤪
Val “sometimes I read the mean comments but then I tell myself I know I’m living the better life” like wtf. Ugh she’s soo egoistical it kills me. She’s def the worst.
I was hurt when they didn’t know benee is the amazing artist who sings supalonely lol
Owen is the middle school boy who gets mad when the girls interrupt their game of soccer lol
when the twin totally helped his bro get that kiss. LOOVEEE. real bros
Please no spoilers and now I hate owen
lowkey i think gaby should’ve said kiss lmao
Not them thinking they are love island but tik tak version.
Nobody:  The cockroach I just stomped: ( 17:50 **look at Owen**  )
look at raul man so inspirational
Jada is nice but she can be annoying..
why could the girls kiss normaly, but the guys saw it as being gay, smh
This show is a guilty pleasure
this is like the popular people from my class
“Basically me and my team where doing breathing exercises”
“Omg go me”...I’m dead lmao
Valeria is so rude... “I just have to remind myself that I’m living the better life and they’re not”. Like really?!
I would just smack the shit out of anyone that got in my way at this point.
E
This whlole show is cirnge im only watching it cuz sab
Julian is a jerk the girl he fancies he votes second last like come on Julian not cool
Yeah.. no I know it wasn't against the rule but that's not cool. Added to why I don't like him.
10:50 i cringed so hard
Lets be honest jada is annoying
we ignoring how nasty and dirty they keep the house...........
Colie has a boy friend already her boy friend is topper guild
WE JUST HAVE TO RESPECT RAUL AND REALIZE THAT HE IS STILL STUDYING DURING THIS SHOW!!! Now that's an influencer right there.
I- wow, that's was extreme 😳
Bruh everyone talking about how jada is so fake at least she will tell you to your face unlike  valeria
unpopular opinion: sab is a bitch but it's lowkey
I know if I was on here I would stay in MY room ALONE and only come out for challenges and tik toks but ik this drama is forced but if it isnt then they're wasting their friendships on a few months of fame, everybody always goes down even Charli is lol
Sabrina is the nicest and sweetest out of all the girls✨sorry ✨
alex blink once if your safe and not kidnapped to do this
Jayda may be viewed as 'problematic' but she is a GREAT host. Someone hire her pls x
I officially hate Owen
Sab.  ❤️.       Colie.        ❤️ Val.           ❤️.          Jada😡
I honestly think jada is just so two faced and can’t go anywhere with bringing up stuff and starting drama- like this is why the group doesn’t like her.. 😃
Everybody turn away!! *sTaRtS ReCoRdInG*
Raul should win
Bitch what happened to being tik tok version no my guys this turn into a dating toxic show the f
why does owen look like a kid and why the hell do they wanna be the hype house aka *not a hate comment*
Owen lowkey reminds me of Jacob Sartorius🤔
"we won the challange" honey why tf you calling that a challenge? This reality show is full of shit
this show is so cringe yet i'm still watching it
27kGolden😭😭😭wtf Raul
Coop is punching the air
the bottle was a paid actor 😩
I’m literally sad that some of the couples in this aren’t together now 👁💧👄💧👁
Kissing the homies isn't gay
Why is this so Good😭😂
I can’t explain how much I HATE colie
9:32  yea well Atleast I’m not fake like you sweetheart 🥺
The fact that sabrina have a boyfriend
Isn’t there a pandemic ????
I feel like Owen would be the type of person that would be...involved with the Piper Rockelle squad, or would like be in it.
14:20 too many sugar packets for colie
I have a bad feeling of this episode! 😝
Raul your hand...
omg y’all is it just me or do u ship val and owen!?
Why have 9 creators and then play teams of even numbers?.?.?
Why he so worried abt his rank like ok lol
Big fan my name is grace please say hi  so hi
sabrinaa what about cooper
why tf are they hatting on gaby just for her looks damn..
Kiss or truth is the best part of the show
Owen keeps manipulating other people
Poor baby raul
What's going on with these people
BLM
The power in that bottle 😅
owen seems like the dude in school who would steal girls phones or pencil cases cuz he thought he was being cute
Ok but like doesn’t colie have a bf and she makes out with Raul...... isn’t she cheating on her bf and Raul.....
Owen was weakkkkk
Owen kind of looks like Payton
PLEASE WHEN THEY WERE MEDITATING I GOT SECOND HAND EMBARRASSMENT
14:21 seizure??????🧐
I would say team 1 won bc Owen cheated
The amount of toxicity in this show is unreal.   There still are secrets to be uncovered...
I ship Gaby and Raul, idc what happens I'll still ship 🙄
9:27 BRUH WTF?!?!? THE ENTITLEDNESS.
Why am I so happy for San🥺
Ummm when Sab and whatever his name is kissed I couldn’t stop thinking about sab and coop
why does Raul kinda look like a Shawn Mendes Knockoff version 💀💀
i feel like this show would be more better with black and hispanic people and that doesnt include wanna be hispanic colie
Owen is so annoying.......
was jada tryna do a finger heart 😃
Gabby being true to her alliance with the boys even though Owen took the trivia questions and she was kinda mad is everything (also everyone being true to it besides Owen when voting 😬😒, like come on dude)
yea in terms of the trivia .. i didn’t know who any of those ppl were and i actively watch tiktoks😂i thought it would be like random trivia about animals and shi
Valeria is such a Jerk
Notice how the girls that was beefing with jada put her in 6th when she did nothing to them
Tbh Gaby is just trying to be one of the boys, she literally said "im gonna put Raul in 4th place because im one of the boys" like what- LMAOAOAOAO
I feel like the producers are setting Jada up
What exactly are you guys trying to influence to the young people? Being this fucking liberated? Disgusting. If this is the definition of influencer now, with no real campaigns or goals to influence people for the greater good, then I understand why the world is in chaos.
Valaria‘s attitude is a vibe
Best show ever low key 😙
9:31  should that rlly be the mindset of an "infulencer" and can we talk about how the questions were based on the hype house- lmfao
That kiss😭💜 i feel so single
can yall leave poor raul he so innocent ;-; n unproblematic they not even being fair at all
Colie is annoying af but somehow I still like hee
Um im kinda confused, how is kissing each other following the covid guide lines, in Belguim where not even allowed outside without mask 🙃
I started watching this because it was so cringy but I just realised I've watched like 4 of them so far thinking "this is the dumbest fucking show, who would watch this?" ......me apparently 😐
they need a better reward then just a FaceTime with Alex
yall I ship sab and jovani
I’m cringing so bad
Owen was that one kid that did stuff at recess just to get in trouble because he thought it was cool.
No one can tell me that Raul doesn't look like Shawn Mendes
It's so funny the way they can make "is apple a vegetable?" tipe of questions seem hard
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABT THE WAY RAUL HELD COLIE’S NECK FURING THEIR KISS-
Im inlove with Raul's character/personality
Sabrina looks so down she's a Queen she shouldn't be affected
owen is a true bro, always there for da boys and never simps
Am I the only one crying because jayda is getting shaded 🥲
Everybody saying it’s cringe but I’m hella invested in this show 🤣😂
I love Owen he’s like a rockstar everytime he talks
kiwis at 6:09 👁👄👁
i'm suprised nobody killed jada in her sleep yet
Im 12 and prob less toxic and childish than they are. Except  Sabrina and Raul. I stan both of them. Also Owen is soooo cringe. Like why is he so full of his self???
LMAO 2:26 julian is so funny i can’t
Is it me or does Raúl kinda look like Shawn Méndez if i was Collie i wouldn't stop kissing him
Okay so, what the fawk am I watching, everyone is so loud like wth and why WHY ARE THEY SO DIRTY DIDN'T YOUR MOM TEACH YOU TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOUR SELFS? Also I can't stop watching it bc the drama is so stupid but good yk like it's the only chisme I get
Val: I just try to remover that I am living the better life and they’re not 9:29 Me just like you don’t know how the person on the other side of the screen is living like for all she knows they could be barely able to afford a house I just think that that was kinda mean and rude but overall she seems like a great person Val if you see this it is just constructive criticism love ❤️ ya
they went in for that kiss
Raul annoying me tbh.
This is so cringe
valeria watches witchtok
Is it just me or does Gabby and Owen make a cute couple!
Gaby: " This girl has no brain cells" Me: It's the final brain cell! dudududu dududududu dudududu dududududududu~
I’ll say it again the show needs more diversity
I like Valeria better with the boys, with girls she just kinda starts
ITS SO EASY TO CLEAN A HOUSE AND THEY CANT EVEN DO THAT
im mad at jada like she said sarina had an attitude uhm ma'am i did not see that
the sway house was founded in 2019 because I remember a bunch of creators went to the sway house (not any of the current members) and were there for about a few months then josh,bryce and everyone moved in and the others were kicked out.
3:25!valeria: in really into manifestations 🤪    *starts meditating*
Ok I’m gonna be honest Raul can get it purr
Is Gaby latina?
The way Gaby did everything just to fit it. Like they hated her then everyone hated Jada.  This is dumb
9:33 I have never wanted to punch someone in the face more than I do right now that is so incredibly rude and self-centered y’all better vote Valeria off immediately
its real cringe of how low jada got like come on
Valeria can LEAVE RN
that is sooo cringe its like wanna be loveisland how its set up to much
Not gaby being one of the “boys” SHES W PICK ME GIRL I KNEWWWWW ITTT
14:33Ik I’m a kid but ....are they eating each other ..or
Honestly now that it come to this episode, i realize that colie is just hyperactive girl who high on sugar, so it make sense if she act childish
Valeria= self absorbed  Owen= annoying as f*ck Sabrina= fair and non toxic Jada=hypocrite trash Colie= cringe but ok Raul= to nice Julian= not much fun and cringe Juvani= he’s ok ig Gaby= cringe rude
is it just me or is raul Shawn Mendez's dopple ganger
"Im LiViNg ThE bEtTeR lIfE aNd ThErE nOt" like ok could you believe how much I dont care cause what you still aint the biggest influencer like I didnt even know you till now so please calm down
Owen: "My last place is...Raul </3" You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain...
I really want jada to stay for drama purposes
Why is colie all ways twitching
They all are pretty chill, like I thought they were going to be more toxic, but they are pretty funny.
3:30 ummmmmmmmmm got you look at his hand
I feel like the rankings r wrong, only one person ranked gabby at the top and she got first while Sabrina was ranked like 1st or 2nd and she got 6th
Not gabby thinking she one of the boys
no Jedi they will be
cant they just kick jada off the show like she getting annoying
I feel that jada is trying to spice things up because there is really no drama
I know they say about COVID at the start, but like Kiss or Truth in a middle of a pandemic 😃😆😃
bro when was this filmed? cuz sabrina is dating cooper
LMAOAOAOAOAOAOAOA
Omg I hate Owen he cheated and he’s so mean
Lol I loved that episode please do more
Owen really screwed the boys over
OMG IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE KISS WITH SABRINA
I can’t stand Valerie I don’t know what it is
I literally can’t stand these people
Collie and Gaby are Literally Pick Me Girls .
in houses i love acting as if i’m one of them and i choose to be ✨Sabrina✨
this show s so cringe but i can’t stop watching it
this show is so terrible it was like watching middle schoolers interact. makes me wonder who would ever watch this unironically.
Love Sab
Raul messed up, he should’ve chosen bros before hoes
I don't think I would have the braveness to be in this competition 👉👈
That's so cool that's so that's
Raul is the best period.
Dude I hate Collie she is so annoying
Julians sweet and innocent smile at 14:25
sab and julian whoa 😃🕶🤏
i was waiting to get my own youtube account just so I could comment on this video 😂🤠
I think we all know why Sab  blew that balloon so fast
This was heartbreaking cause colie's BY FAR my favorite 😭😭
Owen: and that my friends... is DESTINY  Me: no. it's CHEATING :)
Gabey is so funny “I think one of your brain cells feel off”
Jada is the best
I can’t stand Jada 🙄
SO JEALOUS OF COLLIE
sabriana is the only one that is not starting drama so far
Is there only one couple just wondering I literally have no idea
Julian kinda did say a lil dirty ik it’s Strategy but boiiii
I wish I could be there with y’all
They should do a kids version
i still don’t think the first round was fair because owen literally cheated.
did nobody see colie twitch @14:22
I love all of y’all’s episode’s
Owen acts like a 5 yer old like grow up
Why didn’t team 1 get to answer the question about griffin’s diss track if team 2 got to answer the question about supalonely or however you spell it
Owen looks like he’s 11 I don’t get what people see in him
I’m sorry but I don’t like the twins they are rude, cheaters, and just not okay
14:33 love that part
14:11 why collie twitch like that😭🤚
I feel like there needs to be some sort of elimination
sabrina is so awkward its really bothering me
LMAO DID NOT JUST MANIFEST I-
Valeria:”I just have to remind myself that I’m living the better life and they’re not” Everyone watching this video:🙄👁👄👁
This was so fun to watch
What is Owens problem with Sabrina? He is always ranking her so low.
I love these shows
Why did Jada say Sab had a attitude throughout the whole challenge , she didnt even talk
Wow Owen not a surprise
At 13:36 what is Sabrina and Raul doing like back off he belongs to Colie       Or I Pfizer they where doing just for fun nobody take this the wrong way
lets go Queen of strings
Wait someone help me ok? Julian is the one who likes Sabrina and they made out tonight, right?
Why do they all act like they are in 7th grade
I absolutely hate Valeria I can't even
why is owen SO annoying
when valeria said that "im living the better life" i rolled my eyes so hard, this girls are so fucking toxic, seriously the only real ones are sabrina and gaby.
Why Hollywood? Jada said that who was dissed in CONVIENIENT
The first episode I didn’t really like Colie but now she is kinda cool.... is that weird?
don’t say God’s name in vain
Omg.
RAULLLLL PLSS 😭😭😭
Valeria is cool
Owen is a younger and much more annoying Cody orlove
Isn’t collie dating topper?
K but Owen is mad at the alliance because he got ranked 5th when last episode gabby got last🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️
I love Sabrina and Colies friendship
Valerias face change when idk who said we’re you in school 😭😭
I tought sway was 2019
I’m confused is there no elimination
Ik y’all don’t like Colie but she seems like a nice person she would match my energy sometimes
sabrina and  julian are soo fucking cute
Okay what’s so bad about cleaning the house like I clean my house every day
1:40 dog: help my please
The guys on this show are not cute and are arrogant jerks why girls but I mean I could say the same about the girls
Okay I’m sorry this is literally the definition of click bait. These tiktokers probably don’t hate each other in real life and have 0 beef but because they are being filmed they are asked to start drama
the kids learning history in 2120 will look back at this and think: "damn, we did this shit"
Yang pilih allah like.
Superb.
I feel so bad for San becasue she is so nice and some of them are dissing her for no reason 🤨
please tell me I'm not the only one who got a ad of the show while watching it...
Me happy because I thought Jada left.
hello
OMG KISS
Does Owen have terrets
jada needs to learn she creates MOST of the drama
Sabrina Julian ship
team two only won by cheating
I hope all this drama is fake
So they didn’t know Alex was gonna be running the house how???
Confusing to me how close Sab and Colina are because Sab so unproblematic and chill and Colina is insanely energetic and annoying
shouldn't team 1 should've gotten to answer the question team 2 got wrong? this is so face! AND OWEN IS SO ANNOYING
I feel so bad for Raul
I feel so bad for Raul
Stan Sab for clear skin ✨👑
Gabby is Lowkey funny "one of ur braincells just fell off" lmao byee-
Me and sab made out and she called me the hottest person and she promised
stop Raul looks so shocked at 3:52 its adorable. Stan him for being unproblematic and cute
17:28
Okay Valeria’s answer was kinda messed up but you ain’t hear it from me the haters need to stop 🛑
screaming pretty provledge.
Sway was found in 2019
So is covid not a thing anymore or?
I feel like colie is like an Emma she is like boy crazy and look crazy
plotwist everyone is toxic
Is it just me or those Owen think that he is better than all, I kinda thinks it annoying🙄
jada is literally TOXIC
How is a call with wanna be David dobrik a reward. And why do they act like their content is inspirational, all they do is the dance for 15 seconds and 90% of the time they didn't create the dannnncceeee
Honestly, Raul is so calm, like he actually has a future like a REAL job hopefully Sab is successful the rest...
Owen collie and Jada are so annoying like STFU istg. Being cringy is not a personality trait (own and collie) Jada screams so f much like, please...
BRUHHH IM DEAD. WHEN COLIE AND RAUL KISSED 😭 WHAT WAS THAAATTT
colie used to annoy me so much but she’s grown on me. she’s really the blonde friend😭
I love how Raul was freaking out the whole time playing spin the bottle
If Owen didn’t cheat they wouldn’t have won
wasnt sway founded in 2019
gaby is so annoying
Sabrina is Gay
when the jerks are talking to alex and hes saying don't listen to the jerks/haters I was like *Slaps forhead* Owen has no right to be so ugly. All the boys are so arrogant and the girls are so vain and fake it's annoying. Raul is the least fake one in the house.
wtf “i’m still apart of the boys” pick me choose me
Why does this show fell so scripted
Wasnt the sway house founden in 2019?
Why does it looks like it’s all scripted tho? Bc it is.
colie is SO annoying oh my god she makes my head hurt
9:28 girl what-
This is kinda like “Too Hot To Handle” mixed with “Survivor”
Gaby is honestly my favorite she is so really and funny i love her 😍
what's in the back of all their shirts?  like is that a microphone or something
Gabi and raul are my favorites
I CANNOT STAND SABRINA, OWEN, & VALERIA
All the girls and Owen have a huge ego
I just love Valeria and collies good vibes like 💅💅🤌🤌
The cringe tho it is powerful I can FeLl it
colie:i was gonna get on top of him Valeria: Raul come back
tell me why I felt awkward when Colie and Raul were kissing?
Jayda reminds me of one of my toxic ex-best friend. Always saying she hates drama and yet plays the victim and talks behind everyones back
Wow great episode
raul is so unproblematic he’s my favorite 😜
Collie is such a vibe like omgg
17:57 ”I  was gonna get in him“ 😂😂
Julian and sabrina are super cute I want them to date again 🥰
Why are all there 14 year olds not at school 😂😂
i dont like owen
When’s the next episode
what time does each episode comes each week?
POST THE NEXT EPISODE 😡😡😡
when is the next one coming out
gaby is so rude..
owen is trying too hard lmfao
Wait Sab has a bf tho bro...
“One of your brain cell just fall off” okay but that made me laugh 😂
Ok but is Sabrina into Julian or jovany
Everyone on this show is annoying tbh
I swear if y'all don't make a fifth episode ima beat each and every one of you up Im way too hooked
Because I’m still pArT oF tHe BoYs
Why not make like the Amazing race
this does not look like social distancing
I don’t really like Sabrina tbh
Bruh I flipped my phone when I saw the second kiss
When is the next episode
this Show is good but bad ya know like I don’t wanna watch it bc I mad at some of them but I just wanna keep going lol and why they push up their b00bs so much
I've known jada since high school and she isn the sweetest soul ever this show is playing her to be the anger black women and their doing her so wrong ,don't believe this shit :)
wow she said that she was livin a better life well she dose not know that
ok but coolie not even bad she can just be a lil much sometimes like atleast she not toxic like jada.
I ship Sabrina and Javoni
Jada is a Bad bish. Don’t even argue with me 🙄🤚
Kiss Or Truth woww
When’s the next episode coming out?
Collie will win the belly dancing challenge
i feel bad for jada and can tell she’s sad. on her live she said how sabrina made her loose all her friends on the show:/
When is next episode???
Coop watching this 👁 👄 👁
gabby being part of “the boys” alliance is so annoying💀
Sorry
this show is actually awful but i still binged all the episodes😳
Walmart version of love island lmfao
coop watching this rn 👁👄👁
Gabby is a whole mood
Owen is mad annoying Lmaooo
I- I guess gaby is one of the boys now
ok jada is problematic but why did 3 girls team up on her in the last episode. i woulda cried to
honestly sab got problematic so my favs are owen and gabby :)
Total drama influencer
i cant stand those white girls like "oh i was born in mexico.. so im mexican"
When the next one coming 🤷‍♀️
I LOVE THIS YALL ITS SO CRINGE BUT IM INVESTED 😭
Sab the baddie
I hate Owen.
This show is so cringey but I can’t stop watching 😭😭
When a Colie finally kissed a boy on the show but in reality all she wanted to do was kiss Owen and she never did
Sway house was not founded in 2020 it was founded in 2019 so that wrong 🙄🙄🙄🙄
I feel like Owen cheated and stole an I absolutely hate him now
Well glad they have so much real-world knowledge... oh wait😬
Whats Owen's ethnicity?
Is it bad that I ship gaby and Julian 😭😭😭
bro those twins are so annoying they’ve been tryna make it big on YouTube for years but they still can’t do it 💀
I thought the sway was founded in 2019
I think this is scripted for entertainment purposes, they make jada seem so much meaner. It can’t be anything with race because jada is friends with Hannah
I hope i could be in this show one day🥰😏
raul is so cute omg.he’s so confused and unproblematic. when he popped the ballon HIS FACE AHHH
Raul makes me uncomfy he's so awkward AHAHAH
Corona who?
why didn’t team 1 get to steal when team 2 got the question about griffin’s song name?
Bro wtf even is this shit. Gtfo my screen.
Honestly I found it cringy when gaby said that she’s part of the boys 😬 umm no
no stop
They really cheated and won-
Colie is the only girl that should win cuz the other girls are gonna start drama way to easily 🤚
Christmas 🎄
Who has 8 days till Christmas
Damn this video was very entering but lots of drama and tea spilled
I HATEEEEE Owen with a passion
Isnt sabrina already a tiktoker with a house
सौभाग्य से मैं *INSTAGRAM* के इस अद्भुत हैकर *CYPHER_HACK77* के संपर्क में आया, बस मेरा खाता ठीक हो गया, मैं वास्तव में एक अच्छे काम के लिए उनकी सराहना करता हूं
सौभाग्य से मैं *INSTAGRAM* के इस अद्भुत हैकर *CYPHER_HACK77* के संपर्क में आया, बस मेरा खाता ठीक हो गया, मैं वास्तव में एक अच्छे काम के लिए उनकी सराहना करता हूं
why did team 2 get to steal team 1's answer when they got it wrong but when team 2 got it wrong the girl just said the correct answer
What happened To sab and coop
isn't it weird to think this was filmed a long time ago 😂 because Alex's hair isn't that long anymore
Wow! my tiktok account is permanently unbanned all thanks to *primehack66* on IG who helped me in less than an hour...
Val and  Sab are a whole mood
5:30 she did the korean heart ❤️
Idc what anyone says jada is so annoying
i hope raul wins everyone else is a bad influence to society
Yeah I know
I have a question is this scripted cuz like why is Jada the person who is do drama like in the movies so is this scripted?
No sway was founded in 2019
I don’t like how the only black person on the show is the bad guy and the most hated and that the reason people don’t like her is because she’s too “loud “ and a b**** ( just cause she’s outspoken and not going to allow others to walk over her doesn’t make her mean .
Jada always playing innocent. 🙄
Okay but the house was a mess 🤮
Why do I love this show so much ahhhh its so addicting
I thought Sab was dating that other guy
wtf is this
Whoa look it's David dobrik 😱
When come the next Episode?
bruh sab has a whole bf
Gaby is annoying

Tiktokers are taking over and cringing youtube this needs to stop they need to stick to tiktok
Please make another episode im so invested in this
Colie mad annoying😳🤚🏻
Is it colie date topper
This show is weird and stupid but yet I keep watching it also jada is annoying asf
Owen cheated
Just from watching the first episode up till now, Colie is definitely boy crazy and annoying. Jada is more annoying from the other episodes because she can't let go of small things, she always starts drama and runs away from it as soon as someone confronts her about it.
am i the only one who ships collie and owen?
isn' t sabrina dating kio
i ran so fast after i saw tiktok
SABS VOICE IS SO HOT 😅
Omg I love raul he is so kind and no drama ! He deserves it all he hasn’t done anything bad
I'm living the better life and their not?!?!??!
Omg gabby said she is apart of the boys she is THAT TYPE OF GIRL
not gabby thinking shes part of the boys.
F**k jada
okey but i kinda like colie more after watching this
SABS SO PRETTY GOSH
in the question part with the balloons, they should have let team 1 steal since the other team got it wrong.
I loved this episode and I love this show
They're playing "kiss or truth" with a whole minor in the mix? Um.
imagine filming a reality show during a pandemic
Omg that’s the Jersey shore house
Doesn’t colie have a bf
The last question is incorrect the sway house was founded in 2019 I still think the other team should’ve won  because they cheated
I feel like this will be the next keeping up with the Kardashians
Omg my name is jada 😅
Comment which people annoy you the most!!🤪👀
Omg cleaning nooo how dare they😐🥱
I love this series 💗
Sab do be cuddling with everyone 😂😂
Sab prefers to be called sab she said " I prefer to be called sab, if someone calls me Sabrina it makes me feel like their mad at me "
the sway house was launched in 2019 not 2020
Lmaoo Sabrina is such a mood she looks so bored of this show 😂
Sab with coop tho
Why they make the Black girl look bad in like every show💀😭
The timer is the funniest thing ever
Explanation to the Sabrina Cheating rumour going around ⬇️ I hope this clears it all up    You probably came here with that drama from tiktok room about sab "cheating"on Cooper. Let me explain all details in here. The show started shooting OCTOBER 3, 2020 and ended OCTOBER 13, 2020. The way that I knew this is through sab's vids. In the first episode you see sab wearing a GREEN bikini top, and when I scrolled through sab's page she wore the same outfit as the first episode when it was OCTOBER 3, and Alex stated in the first episode that the show will have 10 episodes which was 10 days. During the shoot, cooper only simped/crushed on sab. But after the shoot, sab moved to LA because she joined "NOT A CONTENT HOUSE" which was located in LA, then sab and coop started talking and hanging out together. OCTOBER 29 they started a live and kissed. So in my theory they made their relationship public on OCTOBER 29 but they were already official days before the live. So the summary the twins lied so they could get clout, and made Sabrina receive a lot of hate. So the victim is Sabrina not Cooper. That's all thank you
This gives love island vibes
What is this sliver of aids I just wittnesed
Who watches shit like this? Dumb downed society.
The state of content on YouTube is so sad.
What is this crap?
“Tik Tok Creator Mansion” please we need another genocide
I don't care what anyone else says Gaby is the real one in all of them
They all look like different version of themselves. There isn’t any distinct personality between any of them lmao just a bunch Hollywood plastics in the making
Jayla is so annoying like girl you can go make drama and then play the victim then wanna be friends . That’s not how it works
Raul was blushing so hard
5 warning signs of an abusive relationship over on my channel😜subscribe for more random shit, great video by the way :)
cease this cringe
I'd laugh if some of them got mono or a cold sore. 😂😂😂😂
I weep for humanity.
why where all the questions of Noah Dixie and griffin 💀
Yall ever notice sabrina is dating coop and now shes kissing and flirting with whats his face
This is so mf cringy
Wow in beginning with the team two 🤭
When is a new episode gonna come out
Wtf is wrong with this world. 😳 Ok. I'm done. I no longer have faith in humanity after seeing this garbage.
Owen tot the boys ranked him low when it was the girls and ditched the bois
Owen IS SOOOO COCKY
All I heard was Griffin Johnson
Doesn’t Sabrina have a boyfriend? Lmao
I WANT THE NEXT EPISODE NOW I CANT WAIT😂
what’s funny is the only person who I know who got famous from this was Sab
Collie and Valeria are for sure the pick me girls
Poor Kayla she’s so sweet in real life 💫
Even though it's kinda entertaining what does playing games got to do with being an influencer. And they get ranked by each other.  It's doesn't even make sense
here after the sab and julien drama...he rlly rated her 7 and she rated him 1st LMAO
The house ranking seems so rigged... honestly this whole show does
Im sorry I really dislike Jada, shes fake and shes always starting stuff
i'm watching this after the cheating scandal came out with Sabrina and Julian and I-
Tbh Raul is the chillest person there he don’t be in drama he just tryna accomplish his goals and careers.
Who’s here after Sab’s and Joavani’s stuff?
Ik this was filmed before hand but imagine Cooper’s reaction to sab kissing julian 😳
Owen pisses my t fawk off
colie is by far the best in this house... she’s so nice she’s positive but everyone still hates on her
dude i love raul ! he got studies to keep up w. he’s not w all the beef . as he should .
SHIIIIIIIIII
Oml why is collie on this lmao
Owen and val  I see something
Knock off love island
valeria: "clean my room!!" LMAO mood
omg a mess  that big swiffer can not help
Will colie ever be quiet or be calm she is on my last nerve
this is the most annoying Group of people lmao why they act like that
🥺only if there was more of Sabrina and Julian kissing the would have been a cute couple but no whyyyyy 🥺😭😂
i cannot believe jada thinks it’s okay to clap in someone’s face
this is soooooooo stupid she  reaally asked the team who griffin was diisin in his convenient distrack and then other question what was griffin jhonson dis track name and they say hollywood this show is  absolutley stupid and cringy af
LMAOO
Valeria is so frickin pretty
wait but jada had no hesitation when she said kiss
Yo Sabrina is already famous why she there lol
Valeria bathing suit dose not fit her 😂😂
NOOOOOO SAB YOU HAVE COOPER
Gaby went from last place to first place really quick lol
why didn’t team 1 get to steal when team 2 got griffins distract wrong?
ppuuhleasee why do they all think ¨hooking up¨ means kissing ☠️☠️😭
lol!!! colie and juile 12 secend kissssss

I- I'm too young for this-
When they said clean the house I was like what’s the big deal I do that everyday
OH TO BE THE TWIN WHO KISSED SABRIMA

PLEASEEEEE tell me i’m not the only one who didn’t know any of the questions.
Why is Raul SO UNDERHYPED
8:18 lmaooooo
I feeel like the boys just vote the boys just because there all friends and the girls vote for like an actual reason 😑
ngl these are some dry ass personalities...
The highfalutin ounce statistically deliver because interactive serendipitously obey amidst a regular cd. rainy, puffy notify
I'll bet that colie ate those chips up off the floor.
I love jada but sabrina and valeria are soo right.
I don’t like Sabrina!! She has an attitude. Like why u sign up for this if u weren’t going to be a good sport? Mayb if u stop following  Val around it would help her resting bitch face! JS

𝐢 𝐝𝐨𝐧𝐭 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐯𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚-
I love this series so muchhhh!!
ew gaby said “bc im part of the boys”
👄.......
They're all pretty and handsome. Sad that some of them has sh*tty personalities on the show.
Who doesn't know "Convinient " Like srlsy!!?
i do think that it was cheating how owen took the trivia questions out of her hand
being an “influencer” is really not that serious
owen isn’t even cute. he’s literally so annoying
👄
my fav is san bc who the hell are the other ppl? also colie, jada, gabby, and the guys are pissing me off
Idk why but I get so much second-hand embarrassment from watch this omg..
Doesn’t sab have a boyfriend now😳when was this made?
what year was the sway house founded, 2020? that's so wrong its like under 2018
sab just does not want to be here
gabby and raul are my favorite
Is this American love island??
Valeria is soooo mean and fakeeee like chillllll gurllĺll
Coop watching this 👁💧👄💧👁
I don't like any of them except for sabrina and gaby.
Owen is first of all not even cute or handsome and second of all he's annoying
When sabrina got both of the twins I was like yeah she's gonna kiss giovanni and julians not gonna kiss her or Giovanni gonna kill him 🤣🤣🤣
“I’m living the better life, and you’re not” WOW  This is why people hate you/dislike you
Cool
Doesn’t colie have a boyfriend?
I thought everyone would put jada becuase she didn't even get to participate in the challenge🤣🤣
Can someone tell me the order I am getting so confused
This is so cringe
Sab is my fav honestly she is so amazing, gorgeous and just lovely 😊
Damn
gaby redeemed <3
IM IN LOVE WITH THIS SHOW FR
Sabrina:im gonna be the bigger person Jada: say8ng sorry first
GOD bless GOD love u

I THOUGHT COLIE HAD A BF
Wow, this episode Wild.

But Owen sooo ugly!🤮
Collie is glossy obsessed
Poor cooper
Omg am I the only person that ships Valeria and Owen😳✨
My favourite people have to be Sabrina Raul Valeria And ......... Jada
They literally fucking cheated the only reason they won was because they took it from the other team 🙄
OMG! I totally ship Jovani and Gaby❣️
Am I the only one who hates Owen
What an arrogant group of teenagers acting like children....
I feel like team 2 cheated that’s just my opinion
Dam they been going at it 😅😅
Raul was blushing so hard when they kissed👀it's kinda cute tbh(his reaction I mean)
If you live in India then you know this is advanced Bigg Boss
This was probably my favorite episode 😂💗
Omfg😂😂😂😂😂😂
It doesn’t look like any of them has cleaned anything in a while, by the way this episode was fun to watch. 👌💁😑😋😍
So annoying how they cheated in the first challenge and got no punishment
Omg Raul and colie
Sabrina and Julian are actually really cute together
owen: hollywood me: tf-
I just wanna see Julian shirtless
I feel like Owen's whole personality is cringe😬
am i the only one who actually likes colie
Collie has a boyfriend she cheated unless the is old
6:50 If we follow the pattern, shouldn't the other team have had a chance to steal that? Why introduce steals if it only works in favor of one team...
I don't even have tiktok,  How the hell am I here?!
I hate Owen man
Raul eyes were watering awww
Jada:Sabrina had an attitude I feel like Sabrina: LITERALLY smiling and having fun. I hate Jada and Valeria because she's annoying
Not jada complaining about sabs attitude during the rankings
Oml what an epic episode🤭
owen it's so annoying wtf
Thus was the best one
I guess julian is scared of me🤣😂😳
Gaby about colie: my goodness that girl has no brain cells
Am I the only one who actually liked collie like here tik toks annoy be but she seems really sweet and like she has a good personality on here
sab just looks like she doesn’t want to be there 💀
I thought it was Thomas that made the hype house
Haha I love this pls post more of these
Wowww this episode had me screaming all over the place 😹😹 THANKKK UUU VALERIAA ✨❤️
Jada is two faced bruh. She litterly talks behind someone back and ranked Sabrina 8th then kisses her to make up? fakeeee
Damn Coop would’ve been HELLA mad
This episode was um......Interesting we can say
I haven’t watched all the episodes and this one yet but the belly dancer girl must me annoying as heck and everyone prods hate her ( this is my opinion btw )
Owen literally cheated
Sab and I forgot his name had a hole make out session LMAOO
So is no one gonna talk about the fact that half of the questions were about Noah Dixie and griffin💀
I’ve been waiting forever to watch this!!!!!!
" Collie one of your brain cells fell off " 😆😂
Not Raul being nervous to kiss Collie.. it was lowkey cute
Colie & raul kiss wow, they kept coming back 4 more 😂
Why do I put myself threw this it’s so cringe
Love when Julian says own ranking val is cap then they bring back what owen said earlier lol
Every lowest rating person should leave in each episode, it would be more dramatic or so & u see the other ppl more, just a thought now
I WANTED SOMEONE TO KISS GABY SO BADLYYY
Sab looks like she just doesn’t wanna be there💀🤚🏽
Sabrina looks so sad when Julian Said  truth and when he said Gaby! Aww she likes him
yeah i don’t like owen now
if at any ponit jada says its bc i am colored i am leaving fr
Team 1 are cry babies everyone cheats deal with it
is it just me but aren’t they literally that annoying popular friend group in school
Cooper watching this like 👁👄👁
I COULDN'T EVEN HEAR THE VIDEO MY DISCORD KEEPS GOING OFF-
What even was this? It was just a kiss, not really a big deal lol 😂
THAT KISS OMG
Can’t believe these are real people 😭😂

WOW ...gabby went from last to first-
Wasn’t Sabrina dating cooper

lmao  "Hollywood" when they literally said it before  they asked them
Valeria- "sometimes I have to remind myself that I'm living the better life and you're not" Like wtf is wrong with you!?
Dosent Sabrina have a boyfriend???
“I’m living the better life and they’re not.” That made me laugh
I feel bad for raul and jada
I know that Sabrina is dating Cooper right now but I ship her and Julian so bad!!!
I feel like all of this is literally scripted More than a *reality* show
JUICCCCCYYYY AF!!!!!!! I screamed! Which kiss shocked you the most?! ALSO TEXT this number so we can send you EXCLUSIVE NEXT INFLUENCER CONTENT we have just for you (you're welcome 😘)  - +1 (310) 742-0040
Wait Jada was so jealous of Sabrina like wtf just cause she was with them , y’all gonna come at but you can’t make any excuse for her ....
I’m sorry but what were the questions💀💀 they sound like they were made for 5th graders
I hope that Sabrina and Julian are gonna be a couple soon I ship them#Salian
The last kiss just 🤮
This is so staged sabrina is literally dating cooper😭
Lol wait how do you win in this reality thing???? Looool
i think jada suffers from some sort of anxiety but everyone is just too immature to understand it.
You kiss that other dude
What about coper Sabrina
Isn’t Sabrina already dating coop?😂
Colie finally got her kiss 🥳🥳😂
I can't be the only one that DESPISES owen.🤚
447ty
If people weren’t there Paul and Collie could have def kiss better
17:47 “I want to have my life to studying” lol yeah but danm
Isn’t sab dating cooper?
You know i love cleaning
When they think they  are  on love ilands
Raul is too innocent for this lmao
I find it good that Jada and Sabrina made up because it’s not good to have beef with people you live with
Do they even know how privileged they are?
It’s kinda sad that no one has a crush on Jada and there mean to her
I officially don't like Owen purr
Bruhhhhh I thought sab was w coop which one is it sab?
OMG Owen is so anoing
#TeamGaby, all the way, great episode
Valeria is just getting on my nerves
I don’t think they are all mean they might just hate eachother because it’s a competition because if it wasn’t they’d probably be friends
People think Owen is cute but he isn’t no hate I think everyone is cute
Omg this was a wild episode 😂🤣
Owen is so annoying he never gonna get girl
I didn’t even know who that twin is this like a jonny jonny yes papa house ahahah
Team 2 cheated🙄
Owen cheated and it pisses me off.
SAB IS SO CUTE😳,LIKE WTF
Sabrina is the only person i like here
This thing finally got interesting 😏
Ugh, I hate Owen, Jada and Valeria
Who's your favourite?  Mine's Valeria or even Sabrina
Valeria had a lot of trust in that suit top😀
I actually liked Owen but why did he steal the questions and when his team got it wrong why didn’t the other team take it
I really like this serie except for Alex warren. He is the fakest person of the internet, he change his personality in order to copy David Dobrik. I thick that faking emotion reaction just for became famous is the creepiest thing in the world. Sorry but unfortunately this entire serie is ruined by his presence😔.
Owen is unfortunately my least favourite person on Earth
AND THE REWARD ISS... a face time with Alex!! *girl byee*
I only watch for Sabrina lol
How will coop feel seeing this?
this show is too good!!! I wish the next show would come out faster.
What about her boyfriend?
Gosh poor Raul. Like he’s so innocent
Ummmmmm ok
OK SAB U CAN STOP NOW
gaby is so annoying
I don’t think I like Jada
this is straight tiktok ngl
THIS EPISODE GOD COLIE AND RAUL WERE GOING FOR IT
I honestly think Sabrina won like the whole thing or she just in a lot of drama because she has been on TikTok room a few times and not anyone else in the house.
Poor cooper
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 14:30 yooooooo
Man wtf is jovani doing with Sabrina that’s not how u kiss a girl
Omg
Bruh what kinda punishment is cleaning the house like just don’t be lazy
OMGGGGGG
Wooooo😳this episode was crazy good🤣
sabrinas not the bigger person she was v rude to jada before. jada was the bigger person and more mature here for going out of her way to squash drama with sabrina. sab wanted to “stand up for colie” last el when jada said to owen she did her dirty but didnt care when gaby tells colie she annoying with no brain cells fhey laugh. double standard with jada that i dint like 🤨 thats why jada is the best.
lol this episode was so spicy.. I mean all the kisses and the truths. And i ship Sabrina and Julian too much
Dude I honestly don't know how the hell this how is underated is the BEST 🤔
I thought Thomas and Alex made the hype house
valeria is a bad bleep period
Gaby  goes my goodness this girl had no brain cells 😂😂
Quick question: aren't all the girls dating someone? Idk about Jada though
sabrina and cooper shipers are quaking rn
I think Val will win.. what so you think..
I don’t like Owen at all I’m sorry to the people who do 😶
who else thought the 'trivia' was going to be some actual knowledge questions and not how much time you spend on social media lmfao
why is “the next big influencer” determined by a bunch of middle school field day games
Wow people here are sassy,savage,
colie’s the girl you hated but wanted to be friends with in middle school
Jeez I gotta wait a whole nother week
Owen reminds me of a knockoff Jacob sartorius...
There punishment was to do chores for only one afternoon...
Hi AwesomenessTV
woah raul and colie are fkn fate LMAO
Im about to watch it wish me luck
owen CHEATED so unfair
what the hell did i just watch
this ppl r so entertaining u can c in colie's eyes she just wants owen all to herself and i like jada now she is not making drama she is being the bigger person and alex always has such good advise
No one :    Jada: I jUsT sAW tongue!   hahahah
I watch every single video lol, it makes my day ❤️
Gaby’s like the bestttt
Owen🤢🤢🤢🤢
i would have punched owen in the face if he took the questions out of my hand
well we know Sabrina wins becuz she's apart of a content house now.
colie and jada think that they're on love island or smth
Who tf are Gaby and rial I’ve never heard of them before
Omg I was screaming and laughing out of awkwardness when Sabrina and Julian were making out😂
This episode 😏😏😏😳😳😳
Jada..:(
I ship Raul and Colie omg 😳
These people love kissing damn ,what an interesting episode 😳😂
I've been waiting
I feel like the bottle is a paid actor
Bru the shipppssssss
This episode left us hanging!!
valeria was rude when she said “ well ik livihh my the better life so...”
why did everyone jump when sabrina  said kiss lmaoooo
I love how the loosing team still had fun cleaning together.
Sorry not sorry But the "Reality show" is sooo scripted because you can tell Jada is not as mean as they make her out to be!
isn’t sab dating coop and she she just kissed another guy
MERRY CHRISMAS
I can literally smell the toxitity of this show through the screen-
Why didn't team one get the option to steal but team two did?
The truth or kiss really tho?
Wait I’m so confuse so jada put Sabrina on the bottom because she had an attitude but then she wants the squash the beef make up your mind
Guys, i posted TikTok Compilations,  go check it out. I love you ❤️

i lowkey find this show cringe but i can’t stop watching it😭

Hi
Broo owen cannot blame colie why the hell does jada say oh colie u made owen dirty its like shut uppp
this episode was fun lol
was the sway not found in 2019
OMG yes this episode made me screammmm
Good?  I guess, I am really trying to find the bright side in this shit.
Owen is really annoying and messed up
Comment who u think is the least and most problematic
I feel bad for Jada. She seems so sweet and everyone comes at her for no reason
I am mad at Jada and im not even with her in house 😂
all the blond white girls formed a teams and treated everyone else rude
2019  not 2020
I hate Owen I stg he literally stole the questions and also how comes the other team didn’t get to steal when they got the question wrong
If ppl actually believe this I'm out it is sooo fake
LMFAO YUH
I feal like this is racism because all the other members are white and jada is the only black person but then they all just are like ganging up on her like bruh and my least favorite person has to be sabrina and colie.colie doesnt deserve anything at this point sorry not sorry.
I hate owen
this is the dumbest shit i’ve ever seen.
Wow what an episode😳
Finally colie got her wish. To kiss a boy on this show😂
Obsessed with this show!!!!!!!!!!!!☀️😎

I'm only here for Sabrina
What in the tiktok
This is like love island 😂
Broo
AHHHH oh my god I ship Sabrina and Julian
Omg gabi girl he wanted to kiss u
Aren’t cooper and Sabrina  dating ?🤔
"omg that girl has no brain cells" hahaha
"can we get a challenge where I hv to curl my hair and wear heels"  🙄
I personally think owen cheated
" I'm living the better life, and they're not" Bruh stop  That's mean
15:23 lmao he did the spin so precise to get gabi lmao
Just imagine Owen’s face when Sabrina kissed Rual

Can somebody tell me when is twin my heart s3 coming out? 😂
this is the stupidest shit i’ve ever watched
everyone loves sabrina lmao not a bad thing tho
COOPER WATCHING THIS :👁💧👄💧👁
Owen did cheat because gabby had the question in her hand first and he just took it so I thought he should have either given the question back or been disqualified for that but that’s just my opinion.
I love this show we much!!! Hiiiiiiiiiiiu early
