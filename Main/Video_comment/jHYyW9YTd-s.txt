0:50 seeds have been planted Lois might be pregnant   😂😂😂
I'm so glad this universe ended
1:50 goofy bat cowl
Batman got Lois pregnant
It's hilarious that Batman v Superman was such a forgettable movie that nobody remembers that a core part of it its plot is Lex knowing both Clark and Bruce's identity so he could pit them against each other
1:51 😂the ears look goofy probably because we didn’t know how long the ears were going to be long or short
2:39  who will be my best friend now😅😅
at 0:01 who is the bird in the intro
Why DID Batman have goggles and wear a trenchcoat of all things in the future?
0:15
If I may point out that my Client, Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America wants it known that, in those instances where "those who chose to oppose his shield must yield",  there was, apriori, a codicil in that theme song requiring that "a duel is due". And we simply want to apprise the court that, in those instances where "those who chose to oppose his shield DIDN'T yield", that there had been no convincing argument presented before or afterwards that a duel was, in fact, actually due. And so we must then ask the Channel to refrain from further besmirching the abilities and skills of Mr. Rogers over shield limitations over which he has no control. - Sincerely, Johann Schmidt
1:57 i didnt see “the batman” as restarting his timeline, it’s more like a prequel, no? i thought there would be an in-between movie and then robert pattinson’s batman would turn into affleck’s batman so that they could have joaquin phoenix’s joker seamlessly replace jared leto’s or something😂
What happened to you people? Even with the four hour Snyder cut, with so much detail and world building and fine story telling (which you were complaining that it is the main reason for not being able to make good hishes, right now), you are making such a short video!!! I would probably watch again your old videos, because after watching again and again, they are still entertaining.
it's sad this prophecy won't get a shot at coming to fruition
Lol
1:51
'Mother martha turned into Martha manhunter?!"  Awesome........😂
and now the Flash has done the job, this was 2 years ahead of its time
Im usually here coz of batman ckz he is batman 😂
Then WB would decide to throw it all out the window
Crazy how now in 2023, the Batman was right all along!  THE BAT-PROPHECIES CANNOT BE IGNORED!!!
Better than any Snyder film could ever give us.
Batman: Snyder Fans Superman: Everyone Else
2:48    ...
This Movie was Awsome
fyi....i want madmax DC.....
If the rebooted dc movies don’t include a superhero cafe scene we’ll riot
" Because im Reboot Man "
im batman
And a year later, Gnnn annonces the DCEU reboot! So this all felt pretty pointless, huh? LOL
where's the "because i'm batman" line....
Batman cuss?? Cuss he's BATMAN!! Oh, I get it now
We need more Super Cafe videos.
BATMAN 🦇
Every time Bruce calls Superman Kal just makes me happy
I love how the screen changes to 4:3 ratio!!! So underrated detail
Yea cause im "The" Batman
ermmmm it felt just as lame as the 1st lol the plot is so subpar lol and flash is way to ... lol
Woah sounds like if the Snyder cut had been real it could have saved the movie
This cafe interaction between suoerman and batman is the best..
😂😂😂😂 Because I'm "The" Batman lol
“If you’re about to reboot, how can Darkseid even come here if your timeline’s about to start over?!” 1:52
It's funny that Bruce and Clarke have a Coffe shop scene in "Batman: Death in the family" :D
"U mean the vald guy that was creeping at us trought the portal with his grandma" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Super Café has more consistent development than the official DCEU 😂😂😂😂😂
Batman might cuss now but he still never puts down his coffee cup, my favorite aspect of him
yeah cause i am the batman
Why I don’t see steppin wolf at the villains pub?
"Yeah, because I'm *The* Batman."
Well where is the hishe of this $#/† its been one year
If the “The Batman” hishe gets made, I don’t like the ears on that bat cowl.
Cool 😎
I live for the details like the clink of the coffee cup on the table when Batman was talking about his Knightmares.
Superman new suit looks cool
This video is made to promote Zack Snyder justice league film.
Wait, didn’t Lex already know both Bruce and Clark’s identities in Batman v Superman? Like, that’s how he manages to orchestrate his whole plan in BvS to begin with, lol.  Of course, now Deathstroke knows…
2:47 idk why but the way he said “oh f@!&” made me crack up
Welp, The Batman is out……take as much time as you need but we need it  1:50
I love how Batman calls her Mother Martha happily. Deep inside he's a softie and also Batman.
Batman sounds exactly like the Colonel from Battlefield friends 😂
I'm batman
1:10 Batman: has nightmares about a random dude in space he saw through a portal invading Earth HISHE Dubs Ares: What's up with all the Marvel refferences?
1:49 🤣🤣🤣
Who here loved loved Zach sydners justice League than the first one
Why not just do a snyder cut hishe
The whole DCEU is about to get rebooted again
Wow Superman has a bat suit I think I should call him superbat
Super Cafe is to this day my favourite part of HISHE
My mother martha turned into the martian manhunter :D
1:00 - 2:25 😤NOBODY CARES ABOUT THE KNIGHTMARE ARC! JUST MOVE ON!  *sigh* I'm sorry. I didn't mean to snap. I'm just tired of 'Release the Snyder-verse' being a thing now. Can't we just move past this?
Who does Batman’s voice
Now how curious abaout darkside at vilain pub, that would be awsome
I really want a full hishe for Zack Snyder’s Justice League. Love to see what they do with it.
0:49 "When you said seeds I thought that's what you meant..." I'M DYING!!!! XDXDXD
The darkseed
ROLOL  this is SO FUNNY
DC needs to just stop now I mean seriously!
Was hoping for something funny. Weak material. Probably because the film is near flawless.
Bring super cafe back!!!!
But does he still have superman flashbacks?
Who’s right?
You know your franchise is in a bad place when you have to keep re-writing and re-releasing previous bad movies.
because like.. *none* of it has mattered up to this point
The world gets invaded by Darkseid  The world:Guess I'll be mexico now.
1:44 2:41
Jajajajajajajaja
Yeah, I cuss now!
This vid is what convinced me to go watch The Snyder Cut and I was not disappointed.
Idk why you hate dc so much!
They could of done a lil better with this.
I'm late, but "The Batman" isn't an actual reboot. It's just telling the tale of another batman from another universe. So technically batfleck still exists
How Shang Chi should have ended
Huh, I just realized... Joker's vest having so many police badges probably represent how many cops he's killed. Kind of like how American/British WWII soldiers would paint Iron Crosses to the back of their planes.
When feeling down I watch some of these 😁
Why doesn't super Cafe have a them song
Snyder cuss
Au. To me
so basically the end of all the good that once was DC and Batman and Superman.  ...  Alright! Pack your bags people, we're going to live with the Avengers, so grab only your essentials!
ok,now ive been spoiled.
I got a marvel game ad on this video🙄😄
Why is Batman talking through one of those larynx boxes for cancerous smokers?
Hey do you wanna know my secret identity?
Martha Manhunter.
THE Batman's ears here...........
One thing I didn't understand why they made the batman outfit as Adam west one cause it should be Affleck suit no and I wished they could show christian bake batman  before showing the robert Pattison saying that "yeah just like the last time I was this im now this "
Technically the Batman takes place on another Earth. Earth 2.
MOTHER MARTHA BECAME THE......... MARTHA MANHUNTER😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Am I the only one that assumed granny goodness was a gender fluid character? They had a female appearance but a male sounding voice in Justice league unlimited so I always thought they were a fluid character
Goggles-Gatman is Superman dressed as Batman; Superman always puts on glasses to disguise himself, that's how you know it's Superman: if he fought as himself, he'd just get kryptonited, but not if he fights as Batman against tactics intended to neutralize a trust-fund-orphan-furry. Darkside would never think to hit Batman with kryptonite.
Didn't know you're a fan
Batman's lines sound like somethin Cartman would say
"Because I'm the batman" COMEDY GOLD
We want sucide squad 2 HISHE........FAAAAASTTTT........UUGH....
🧸🎩 Freddie fast bear
I love HISHE Villain Pub and Super Cafe
Batman: Like how darkseid is gonna demand our planet when he gets here  Me in the background probably: *FORESHADOWING*
please edit the synder cut in your own way, would love to watch the hishe version.
Why have we never had a HSHE for the Batman design in this Cafe? Superman got his but he never did. Is he supposed to be the Michael Keaton Batman? Where is his HISHE?
This funny movie
please super hero indonesia... GUNDALA feat superhero marvel dc etc
So maybe a batman beyond will happen.
yes who knew having a competent person incharge would make a decent movie
am I the only one that wants a batman-madmax game. I think it would be so much fun
I actually have no problem with Batman cursing… Just seems to fit his character well
I love that Super Man was calling Lex Luthor by his first name!
2:08 Dammit, he's right.
Y’all gotta do Darkseid! Damn
“Well you said seeds I thought that’s what you meant.” Super-Man OP!
Cherry Quartz has more depth. We finally know what's inside the treasure chest. Lapis and Peridot fuse! Steven rescued the othe three rubies.    Sadie might be pregnant!
i think the next justice league might be   the Justice League Dark: Apokolips War
Lois might be pregnant! That’s the detail ur focused on? U said seeds I thought that’s what u meant! I meant darkseid seed 😂
Zak Snyder is still waaaaay overrated IMHO... (just like JJA)
0:33 Superman: My mother turned into Martian Manhunter. Batman: Mother Martha turned into Martha Manhunter? 🤣🤣🤣
If possible I’d love to have a “because I’m Batman!” shirt or (even better) a baseball/trucker hat (or both!) available to purchase in the store. Pretty please?
I'm really loved the Snyder cut.
so batman super powers is visions he can see the future and what is to come
"Oh Its ****The Joker, and I cuss now. I have to roll with this Joker, and I cuss now. " I can't get over it. 😂😂😂😂
Why wouldn't Lois being pregnant be the top priority for Supes, becoming a dad is a big deal!
"Martha Manhunter". Someone was watching Honest Trailers...
Who knew adding two hours could change a film so much!
I like the part where flash time traveled in the end in the Snyder Cut
how did you rig up your characters, what application are you using
Okay this was pretty funny.
Do invincible please
“And I cuss now.” looks disappointed. Literally me seeing that scene lel
No ones talking about how the Yellow Taxi went past 74 times in the course of this vid
And another thing, Discovery is continuing the Snyderverse and has a plan to connect both Justice League movies in the same timeline
The Batman is a seperate universe
Have you guys seen the dark Knight
Make a Snyder cut how in should have ended
Man; This was sooooooo Accurate
Batman and Superman have been sitting in the same seat for over 10 years.
Why dose he cuss now I mean what's the point lol ooooo tough guy for using ******* in your vocab
I think that Batman's dreams aren't really dreams, they're traces of an alternate timeline
Can you do how the mandolorian season 2
Superman: Lois might be pregnant!  Joker: Watch me end everybody's career
They cuss now?  They cuss now.  They cuss now!
This 3 min short is better than the whole DCU
Martha Manhunter ROFL
And I cuss, now! Hilarious!
Okay seriously though, this is a CRAZY AMOUNT OF NEW DETAILS. They need to continue the story somehow. But I’m sure that won’t happen until like 2030 probably 🙄
the sad thing is that we won't see how all of this will end thanks to warner bros
Same Snyder will not get to continue this.
Do the witcher netflix series I wanna see superman react to gerald
Martha man hunter LOL XDDDD
Please do Willys wonderland
Make a full video on Zack Snyder JL that includes darksied
I can't wait for comedy recap of this version
Does Batman ever put the mug down?
Bat dreams.... Bat prophecy dreams...
These dudes are easily among my favourite versions of these dudes...
They missed a couple of opportunities, like when those guys at the start said it was impossible for Bruce Wayne to have come over the mountains, or that he had five satellites so he could say "Because I'm Batman!".
And it’s not cannon... 😐
Flash would've won that battle already. No wait, this isn't the starcraft community. XD
Can you do a HISHE for this movie?
Batman doesn't joke even in his dreams  🤯
What a crazy amount of new detail!
can you make a super cafe where Batman and Superman talk about Batman’s skin in fortnite
They are more than just dreams🦇🦇🦇
Can we have more vids with Jokers beside Heath I love him and all but I loved that little Saga you had with Jared Leto Joker
Because I'm THE Batman  *Holds coffee mug*  BUT THE EARS AREN'T THAT LONG ANYMORE THEY CORRECTED THEIR MISTAKE THEY DIDN'T WANT ANOTHER JARED LETO
Oh my.....Wow
,, because iron man has this treams too,,
Superman: Darkseid is not an issue Justice League Dark Apocalypse War: Allow me to introduce myself
He is not going to reboot its just Robert Batman is just from different universe
I did enjoy The Snyder Cut but that's a given... Snyder basically got to retake a test knowing all the right answers
Please make snyder cut♥️♥️
Should’ve made Supes turn into Martian Manhunter as soon as Batman leaves
In all seriousness, I have zero clue how if Snyder had made the original Justice League, how would he have fit all this in there. If it was a two parter the first one would have had a fan4stic level of action lacking.
These are my favorite videos of Superman and batman just talking with or about other superhero’s
HISHE, I have a request for you whenever you tackle any recent Nolan movie: drastically shift the aspect ratio throughout the video. Over do it. Like each time the camera changes....kinda like the sheriff's hat from SCARY MOVIE 3 (each time it cuts to her, it changes sizes lol)
Who played Superman in this video?
I how meta HISHE is.
Please do a Snyder cut Hishe
He should have said it’s a prophecy because I’m Batman
Lmao dark seeds
It look like they are setting up injustice story
Batman stole a coffee cup.
Brilliant, can't wait to see all the new details, and the return of the Martha Man Hunter
Here’s the true reason why he’s getting a reboot              BECAUSE HE’S BATMAN
I believe DC is upto something big. I just know it
Aren't you compelled to know what happens after I put these Goggles on.the angry voices will not rest haha haha thank you guys once again for a brilliantly funny video
Hishe do all the seasons of The Flash hit the thumps up if you agree
Hishe do all the seasons of The Flash hit the thumps up if you agree
Wow... The Snyder cut was so f***ing dope! 😀 Although it is quite a shame that Green Lantern wasn't in it. I guess he is supposed to be in a sequel (Or at least that's what they planned when they thought there'll be a sequel)
Yay
i am 14 so i can not watch this movie because it is rated r
Hey hishe please make a video on how rhe snyder cut should have ended 🥺
bat man has bad dreams  iron man been there done that
1:19 Why do you think that?  Because I'm BATMAN!
Darkseid didn’t run like a wuss, I think the reason he didn’t got through the portal with his army was because it was a one way portal.
do how the snyder cut should have ended
Lex know his real name, then how did he send the newspaper to Alfred if he didn't know who batman was?
i cant tell if they liked the snyder cut or not.
1:19 i was sure he would say "I'm batman"
Joker is one of beatniks now
Oh no he curses now!
Batman killed in the Burton and Nolan films. Also Bill Finger and Bob Kane had Batman use a gun and kill people in the comics in Batman's first 2 years. Also the 60s Batman killed one guy by kicking him out of existence. Soviet Batman was an anarchist terrorist who blew Soviet citizens and soldiers up with bombs! Batman Who Laughs murders people! The Grim Knight uses guns and kills people! These insane pathetic fanboys need to stop trying to gatekeep superheroes! Ironman, Captain America, and almost all of the Marvel superheroes kill people! Cap killed Nazis for fucks sake and Tony killed middle eastern Arab terrorists while saving refugees and villagers! Wolverine depending on who you ask is either an anti hero or superhero and his claws are used to slice and stab people!
Awsome😁😄😆😂🤣
"IT'S THE PLANTED SEEDS."   Idk why but the delivery on that line cracked me up.
I saw Martian Manhunter, but I don't remember when he turned into/out of Martha.  4 hours was just way too long, and the multiple stories crammed into one was unnecessary.
I'm so glad they brought up that screen shrinking bs
The Batman is earth 2 google it
Nice grandma goodness reference 👌🏻
I died when it quickly showed “The Batman” 😂
Did Batman just steal a coffee mug? xD
Prophecy
What a voice
Yeah😆☺️♥️♥️♥️
I like hishe Batman more than dc
We NeED A hOw iT ShOuLD hAVe EndEd FoR The SnYDeR CuT
when is hishe of ZSJL coming?? we r waiting.......
I’m going to be honest, when the zack Snyder cut showed that Lois was pregnant; I had some major injustice vibes
hahahaha so much goodness.  I literally laughed out loud - and that's rare for me.  Thumbs up!
When will villain pub compilation vol 2 come out?
Just let J letto go...for the sake of at least my humanity
Me: he haunts me everywhere I go Therapist: it's okay hishe batman can't hurt you😂
Boss fight part 2?
Why do you believe that.   Cause I'm batman!!!!
Snyderman into the snyderverse lol
Wait, did Batman say he only slept two or three times in the past few years?
1:50 "Because you are about to reboot"lmao
Looks like the old Super Cafe is back, now that the first Justice League "doesn't count." Which reminds me, how would the Mighty Martha react to the Snyder Cut?
not these kinda dreams.......theses are bat dreams.........bat prophecy dreams......lolololololol
Batsy having nightmares about earth being invaded? Now where have I heard that before 🤔  (Coughs in Avengers)
Batman:  serious dreams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Iron man: you have  no idea how much. Was in my dream  of thanos
Absolutely perfect
Joker lol
I have to roll with this joker... and I cuss now! 🤣
That was funny but I kinda wanted to see Darkseid in your art style.
Hey, I understood that reference. Oh... Sorry wrong franchise.
Bat dreams!
"That guy took off like a wuss." Says the man who spent like a solid day trying to break the portal and repel his invasion.
I hope they continue with the Snyder verse oh and I cuss now
As always Hishe Nailed it🤣🤣🤣🤣
Still waiting for how Zack Snyder’s Justice League Should Have Ended.
BAT DREAMS!
BAT DREAMS!
Luuul
You guys should have made him say because I'm f****** Batman!
My god all these issues. LOL
Love that the aspect ratio changed to 3x4 to match Zach Snyder's "artistic vision." lol
Do one for Wandavision, please.
Superman: "You're so paranoid. Do you know why?" Batman: "Because I'm Batman?" Superman: "Because you're about to reboot." Me: "Just because he's about to reboot does NOT mean his dreams won't come true. In fact, they already HAVE come true, just not after the Snyder Cut. It comes after the Whedon Cut. Wanna know more? Go watch the Film Theory about it. He also refers to the Whedon Cut as "Josstice League," which is just hilarious."
That Christian Bale's Batman voice though 😂
Hey so are you guys gonna make a full hishe video for Snyder cut or like i dunno
Hahahahaha love how Superman refers at Granny Goodness as "with his Grandma"
I mean, I really really would like to see the dystopian future fight way more than anything we've seen so far
Batman's super power is to predict dark futures by sleeping
All that extra detail and yet so little additional artistic value.
Im surprised Captain America wasn't in here
Some of theses video what you made are good & funny to watch but except for the animation no offence, but are you some day going to remastered or reanimated these videos, that would be much better than before to be honest.  If you have enough time for it of course, but I do enjoy The Villains Pub episodes is pretty funny.
why did you say that name?!
Change Batman and Superman looks
7/10 movie in my opinion
WHO WILL BE MY BEST FRIEND NOW
He swore once and they made it into a joke
The Man In The Chair vs The Man Creeping through a portal at us with his Grandma.
Martha Manhunter
You know what as has spoilers for the snyder cut?... the Justice League movie
I can't wait to see multiple Batmans in the cafe.
Here's hoping we get a Snyder cut HISHE
Will you make a WandaVision HISHE?
What a crazy amount of new details.. 🤣🤣🤣
The dark seeds lol
i watched hishe first then the movie , damn the movie was good
"Mother Martha turned into Martha Manhunter?" 🤣
Dudes voice is low key spot on 😂😂 makes it better.
“Yeah, because I’m THE BATMAN!”
"Darkseid seeds... dark seeds..."
Hishe do a how it should have ended Godzilla vs Kong
"Lex knows your real name"  Literally introduced your secret identities, to convince you to kill each other. What do you mean?
We actually do need the Snyderverse solely because of the dreams.
We just gonna ignore injustice being a possibility?
Do a hishe snyder cut
Mother Martha turned into Martha Manhunter?!
😂😂😂😂
use to watch these 4 years ago and they still happen no wayyyy
Maybe now you could Resurrect Martha..
we need a new villain pub too :)
You know the lines said in this video is actually pretty serious, and if you adjust some of it, it can serve as a proper conversation between Clark and Bruce in JL2 (perhaps about making an attack on Apokolips or preventing Darkseid invasion)
You left out the slow motion every 5 minutes
กดพะคยรรนทเบ.ปลกลก
Joseph Kent: No wonder we didn't had any kids! 🤣
Will u be making how snyder's cut JL shud have ended?
c u s s
Lex Luther knew their names in Batman vs Superman though
Bat dreams
the 4:3 aspect ratio was a nice subtle touch well played
Letos joker is just a Jeff the killer knock off change my mind.
Hishe's Spoiler Film - Justice League Zack Snyder
They are more than dreams Kal , They are BAT-DREAMS Do you wanna know why ? . . . . . . . . It’s BECAUSE I AM BATMAN !
HISHE review please!!! 😀
I love this channel !
Ah name eh datman
Crambey juoos
Notice how his suit suddenly got buffed when he got his goggles
Jzjzjsı
i really wanted to watch the snyder cut but the aspect ratio killed me
Mother Martha hunter 😂😂😂
Lex always knew since B V S
Only Batman would swear over swearing 😂
"'Cause now we've got bat dreams..."
Could you guys make a video about how should Batman : death in the family, end I talked about the red Hood story Jason Todd please😃🤩🙃
i thought the tiny box was only on my screen but now i see its on everyone's screen
There's no saving a movie when it's an unrepentant sequel to another movie where the central, pivotal plot point was that the two main characters discover they have mothers with the same name.  Also, don't forget that they ruined one of the greatest DC villains by adding him in as a 10-minute afterthought because they needed an actual villain after the Martha debacle.  Doomsday should have had his own movie.
I just want to say I thoroughly enjoyed the snyder cut, but I thoroughly enjoyed this video too 🤣 SO MUCH STUUFFF 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love me some super Cafe!!!  Only thing I missed from this one was the chance for Supes to say "saved the day," since, very clearly...  He SAVED THE DAY!
Best. One. Yet 😎👍
It's called multiverse kal
I need more!!
Please do Godzilla vs Kong.
You also held a APOKOLIPS motherbox like gun 🔫
martha man hunter 😂😂
I miss you guys so much 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Please do more villain pub
Batman 💪💪💪💪💪😝😝😝😜😜😜😋😋😋🤪🤪😛😛😛😱😱😱😱😇😇😇😇🤡🤡🤡
Batman does have a power it’s dreaming
Omg I can't take it..😂😂😂
*"Mother Martha turned into Martha Manhunter?!"* 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
super cafe batman superman from earth cafe 101... it was never a reboot from the first movie to present.. its only new multiverse earth!!
So if the Snyder Cut was 2 hours longer, wouldn't the Snyder Cut HISHE ideally be 8 minutes longer?
Awesome work :)
I like how it turned sepia toned and widescreen when he put his goggles on 😂
at 1:10 My thoughts: "He is going to say: 'because I'm Batm- OMG HE SAID SOMETHING ELSE!"
Martha Manhunter
By the way Batman language
Batman 🤝 iron man : both having a bad dream that must be the prophecy
Why is he so focused on his dreams?      BECAUSE HE’S BATMAN!
THE GOGGLES!  THEY DO NOTHING!
*Because I'm THE Batman!*
1:47 🤣🤣
When is the hishe coming?
And wandavision??
I can't wait to hear his feedback on Battinson...
This injustice plot is officially ruined by none other than WB themselves. But don't worry, there still death metal plot
Batman: SO MANY NEW SEEDS!  Me: You mean minecraft world seeds? or minecraft plant seeds?
Batman went batsheit crazy.
If u won't notice me welp there's no other godzilla video
Make a dub or how it should ended
Pls
It's hd
Pls notice me watch godzilla vs king kong at 123series pls a
When the rebooted Batman showed up it looked like he had bunny ears
because im pacman
Can Confirm the New Robert Pattison Batman takes place on Earth -2
I don’t think the Snyder cut connects to the actual DCU
Too many details for batman to handle.😂😂  What about the lord of the rings dubs?
These are bat dreams!
Any one else excited for how Zack Snyder’s justice league should have ended
The whole lex knowing their identities thing is from batman Vs superman, why would they be suprised by that?
His grandma? Granny Goodness is extreme........
Darkseid forgot about earth and earth having antilife equation... Lol.... What a pathetic villian....
Pls do a hishe JL Synder cut
Mera has an accent now. It was a poor accent by an horrid actress.
Fun fact Batman and Superman's mother fave the same name
Yes
"Kal" 😂
all this is gonna get "fixed" in flashpoint so why even worry about it.
This seems like george and jerry seinfeld in their diner lol
I have on my goggles kal!
But why does the world have to end now?  After all, it's never ended before.
"We could just toss it up to bad dreams and call it a day and just move on with our lives." – Warner Brothers... probably.
Can you do How Zack Snyder's Justice League should have ended?
Now is their any hope that a super long edition of the Lord of the Rings trilogy will get released as Peter Jackson's super extended cut? ;0)
Not everyone might know this, but "Martha" actually stands for Marthian Manhunter.
Hishe wandavision?
We need batfleck back
Darkseid should take Thanos place as the pub janitor.
why are you guys making fun of me
Also Aquaman's father is dead for some reason. JL happened BEFORE Aquaman's movie.
The bells been rung lmao
I WANT SUPER CAFE AND VILLAIN PUB ACTION FIGURES
I love how the voice of Batman is the Christian Bale Batman voice
The electric shadow proximally whine because greece analytically yawn above a overjoyed makeup. hysterical, nappy government
Lol this batman has coffee mug attached to his hand 🤣🤣🤣🤣 all the time
Lol! Snyder cut was worth it.
We need to see Darkseid in an episode of Villain Pub
This is so awesome! You should totally do a review over the Synder Cut!
Why are we not having a hishe for Mission impossible franchise yet??
2:29 how did we end up in mexico
imagine whedon cut never happened.we might get to see knightmare sequence turned to reality with darksied
OMG i haven't even seen the cut yet and this is ssssooooooooooo hilarious..."or we can just toss it up to bad dreams and call it a day and just move on with our lives" -- thank u i think this is the best line ever for like EVERYTHING!
It weird watching him obsessed about his dreams where Christopher Nolan executive produced the DCEU
martha manhunter
haha the aspect ratio change lol
I don't understand the combination of lines that leads up to "Because none of it mattered up to this point" but a lot of people are quoting it and getting thumbs up in the comments as if it has a meaning that I don't know about.
Yes with a second chance in redoing the movie, having almost 2 years of time to repair, with an extra 2 hours of additional contact, able to hear the complaints and fix on them. Yes Justice League was better than the first Avengers movie in 2012.   Congratulations 🙏👍😉
Ok so in the final conclusion to the superhero Arc: The main bad guy wins, there's a time jump period, and the heroes must use time travel to change what happened and save the day.  Why does this sound familiar. 🤔
You should do a Justice League ROB SNYDER CUT.
1:34   Tony Stark: First time?
cannot wait to see the how it should have ended for the snyder cut. like,  how did the mother box get superheated to the temperature of a nuclear generator sitting inside a sealed glass cube, and somehow not melt the glass or through the table and the floor and the earth itself?
Snyder cut finally made them the cool kids again
Bat dreams lol
And Bats is going out of his mind due to “Dark-seed”. Loving this episode
Supes was so overwhelmed!!!!
“You are being so paranoid”  “no i’m not”  “yes you are”  “do you know why?”  “because i’m bat man”  “because you’re about to reboot”
Should have done The Last Knight
Also please make an animated Dark Knight Returns Hishe if you have time please cause this can help these guys get more Villain Pub opurtunitues
Oh but please, please make A Snyder Cut how is should happen rendition for this Ultimate face of what Directors cuts should be
Can we get a Villian Pub with Darkseid.
The Dark seeds.
is that pete holmes voicing batman?
In the DCAU Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Super Café better show up
“They’re prophecy” “Why do you think that?” “Because-” Me:BECAUSE HES BATMAN
1:51 JEEZUS wuts with the ears?
is it wrong to watch this BEFORE seeing the Snyder Cut??? because i just did
I still have nightmares about him Iron man 3 flash backs intensify
I hated that film more then first one because it was so god damit long that guy that played Don Vito in Godfather is spiting in his grave because of this time record.
Would be interesting to see darksied and thanos interaction in the villain's pub.
I would be flippen out two if I started to weird personality changes
where is wanda vision hishe ? 😌🤔
where can u watch it?
“Who knew adding 2 hours to a movie can add so much more details”.  This perfectly sums up the state of the DCEU fandom. The Snyder Cut is not ‘better’, it’s just longer.
"you mean that bald guy that was creeping on us through the portal with grandma" looooooolllllll Best way to describe darkseid this entire movie
i wuz literally rollin on the ground lol..."the dark seeds"😂😂😂
'Super Cafe - Snyder Cut' should be four hours long!!!!
I'M PUTTING ON MY GOGGLES, KAL!!!!!
Should have said "Martian Manhunter Masquerading as my Mother Martha."
Is there gonna be a HISHE Snyder Cut video?
For those who don't understand the "Reboot" part: It was confirmed that Pattinson's The Batman and Ben Affleck's Batman will still exist simultaneously, but as two different versions of the character.
For the record, it isn't adding up 2hrs to 2017 version. It's totally different.
How does he know my name! I don’t know, “did you tell him” no! Why would I do that, I don’t know! 😂
yeah! whats the deal with these batman premonitions? it actually pisses me off. I mean is that the superpower the wanna give him? i really hate it cos it makes no sense.
Will you make a full Snyder cut how it should have ended?
Thanks hishe this was awesome 👍
So glad I found a seat at the cafe'!
This is really hillarious 😊
There was no examples of how it should have ended.
0:35 "Mother Martha Turned into Martha Manhunter"  That's hilarious man 😂
I just subscribed to your Channel! 🎉🎉🎉
Hi
Vin Diesel As  Darkseid Nick Kroll As Steppen Wolf Danny Mcbride As Jor El David Spade As Thomas Wayne
HISHE batman is the best batman we've seen so far
Imagine Darkseid meet thanos in villain pub
I love Batman voice 😂 it is so entertaining
martha man hunter- lol bro i laugh a half  hour!!!!
🤎
Multiverse baby!
Do WandaVision next!
Batman doesn't curse. Change my mind.
Superman can destroy Darkseid’s source dimension with a song! Don’t forget it Justice League sequel!
Jared leto needs to go back in his hole..
1:51
I need to make this batman my go-to halloween outfit ... with the coffee mug
HISHE is now like dessert. Watched Snyder's cut and came right here! xD
One of these days, this will be considered canon. I await the future super cafe comics officially printed by DC to come. One day.
¡HA! The Joker Leto, never take out the dishes gloves, after cleaning the kitchen, when speak with batman.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Too good
Seeds
Shame the internet pretty much ruined the snyder cut for me within a week of it's release, eventually I'll forget enough to watch it xD
This goes together with Mika Klopsworth's method, you can make the body make them at least grow a couple of cups, much the same as if you were a teenager again, plus you decide what lengths you wish to go.
So Batman is having angry fan dreams?😂
well we wont see the sequel to that anyway
Martha manhunter! 😂
I'm putting on my goggles...😆
The real hishe : Darkseid firing his omega beams and killing all the justice league
Bat prophecy dreams
dark seeds😂😂😂
Don’t get why people are surprised about Batman cussing. He cusses all the time in comic books and he’s more violent. Other than killing people Snyder had him pretty dialed in
(Batman) "The prophecy dreams can't be ignored!" (Superman) "Why?" (B) "Because that's what they did in the MCU and it made them boat lodas of money!" (S) "So what you're saying is that if we ignore the dreams we'll go on to make a bunch of money in a big climatic 2 part crossover set of movies, but because you're insisting we that we can't ignore the dreams we have to NOT do that." (B) "YES! We can't be called copy cats! We're ORIGINAL! We can't be caught ripping off of other's success!" (S) "Too late for that." (B) "Stop not ignoring the prophecies!"
Martha Manhunter.😂
To honor the Snyder cut, 25% of this should have been in slow motion.
1:51 return of BAMBI BATMAN
Fantastic. 🤣 We live in a society, ya know.
All I can say is Martha, it's all about Martha, Martha Martha Martha, like on the Brady Bunch with a Jan accent.
They can do whatever they want because of one word. MULTIVERSE.
what? No reach around?
i love every second of this it is the perfect embodiment of what everyone thinks, i think and Batman totally sounds like a lunatic xD
Can I have a shout-out kid Marquis McFadden
Bravo, you guys nailed the Snyder Cut!!!!
So their basically doing DC infinity war with Batman as tony stark with the visions of the future and darkseid as thanos
These are bat dreams
GOLD!!!
I remember when these vids were actually funny
HISHE , So you are not gonna make a review about the Snyder Cut ? , scared of the DC Fans "Hate" ?
Ha ha!
Are you going to do a Hishe review about the Snyder cut????? Please do Hishe reviews again
Wrong type of Seeds, Superman! 😏
They didn't even mention the importance of singing, sweater-sniffing lady.
i really like the video, thinks it
Ya here we go your goofy dreams again 🤣🤣🤣
Also available in sepia tone. Apparently.
"Who knew adding 2 hours to a story could change so much?" Anyone who's read great books that became alright movies lol.  Too bad this version isn't considered canon. :(
"These are Bat Dreams"🤣🤣🤣🤣
Are you going to wandavision hishe
Y'all crazy crazy
Lol ya kinda gotta do a HISHE for tje snyder cut now......and think of the views.
How godzilla vs kong should have ended
Can't wait to see you do review vid  I always love your channel thank you for make me feel happy
the Dark-seeds
What pisses me off is that warner doesn't want to roll with the new cut
ROFLMMFAO!!!!!!!
Batman: These are serious dreams. They are prophecy. Superman: Why do you think that? Batman: Because... (And I seriously thought he would say) I'm Batman.
Batman didnt pay for his coffee
HISHE Of Wandavision
When will you create a proper video for synder's cut?????
Literally just Konrad Curze
Martha Manhunter! I've been saying this since I saw it!
I'm shocked he can drive around the wasteland with Joker's grabby hands
Are you gonna do a longer HISHE of the ZSJL?
Supes : You're getting reboot, Batman.  Batsy : Atleast not a racial reboot...
Should’ve had him in bens suit
Can't wait to see Justice League Synder Cut Hishe How It Should Have Ended
Well on HBO it was 4 hours man!
Españooool
batman would call superman Clark, not Kal
this script was really smart especially for how short it is.
who would have thought doubling the length of the move would change it so much. :)
This really emphasizes how bad the Snyder cut *STILL* is and how bad WB messed up.
Bruce calling him Kal lol
Batman is like Cartman in this cafe series
Lol I like how the screen changed size and the scene got desaturated like in Snyder justice league.
i miss them
I don’t know what they are surprise that Lex knows Batman real name. Did they not remember Batman v Superman?
"Not these dreams.  These are bat dreams.  Bat prophecy dreams."  Lol dead XD
I like Snyder cut, the movie makes sens now.
Why that joker bring Heath ledger in everything would go great
What the BEEP
you gotta do a hishe of the actual movie, only it has to be twice as long as normal and most of it in slow motion!
Yes, cussing is funny... ...in moderation.  Don't let Captain America hear it.
HISHE: Y gotta ADD Jack Kirby (now that New Gods & Eternals/Celestials are in movies!).
✅📺💻
the only reasons this has so many negatives are all the people that were in love with  zack and think giving it a thumbs down he'll come and make them the next batman
Could u make how how to train your dragon 1&3 should have ended😉
We need a hishe divergent
I don’t think the are remaking batman I think they’re just doing an origin story
Yep I wonder if there’s gona be a super baby.
Question: Is he saying "bad dreams" or "bat dreams"? Answer: Yes.
Luthor knew the secret identity at the end of BvS "Wayne Manners"
If they introduce multiple universes, they can have multiple Batman.
I love that he's still acting and talking like Batman, but still calls Superman by his first name.
And I cuss now bleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep been waiting to do that for years
This was me and my friend after we watched the Snyder Cut 🤯
Looks like Batman wants a suit of armor around the world..       Wait
I really loved how the screen went square and darkened just like The Snyder Cut. you did really good on this!, now I can't wait till How Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) Should Have Ended!
So Bruce is Tony having premonitions about an apocalyptic future. 🤭
These are bat dreams bat prophecy dreams 🤣🤣
Batman: ... the angry voices demand...   Harley: It's finally happened. Bat's just lost his friggin' mind.   Joker: Just? ;)   :P
Apparently there's nothing even hishe could find to edit and change in the Snyder's cut hence no big changes seen
01:35. "These are Bat prophecy dreams."  You mean like having a son (which isn't Damian) in the future that might have a cooler Batsuit than you?   Oops, too much too soon? :P
As far as I'm concerned, Batman's new best friend in Knightmare is Barry, not Joker. XD
If you haven't, GO WATCH IT NOW! It's absolutely stunning (the Snyder cut, of course)
Amazing! Great job!
I’m going to say it                             A crisis event will happen
"Bat dreams"
Bec Bec who?  Because I'm Batman!
1.2k down votes from salty marvel fans
...So basically Batman has Tony Stark syndrome.
DC should hire you as a batman voice character seriously 🤣
What if Flash rewinds time to stop Knightmare and thats how we get The Batman?
seriously, they are rebooting Batman. does not look like DC has any long-term plans like Marvel. Even the CWN has more plans than DC movies.
Marthian Womanhunter
I freaking love you guys
yeah cal didn't you see iron man's dreams they lowkey came thru
Watched the movie today. I swear they could have saved over half an hour if they didn’t pad out the runtime by have so many slow mo scenes, trimmed down the quiet emotional scenes (some were just too long) and just left Martian man hunter as an end credit scene.
wandavision.. pleaseee 😭
i love that the frame is smaller like the movie
Sweet dreams are made of-   Oops wrong speedster
Wow you haven't been in my inbox for MONTHS
the only bad thing about the Snyder Cut is that Jared Leto was in it.
There was prequel comic which was released before the theatrical release of Batman V Superman....... In that Lex Luthor finds out who Batman is....
Make a HISHE of batman as the biological father of Luis baby because when superman was dead they had an affair
I love how the color grading shifted. That's so funny!
Next up, Godzilla vs Kong please! The movie that was completely devoid of logic. 😂
Marthian Bathunter
Diana get Nerf when fight Stpwolf
Martia....man......
Superman:“Why do you think that” “ Batman: “Because none of it mattered up to this point” This is my entire life summarized
"and i cuss now"  -Batman 2021
Hahah great job 🤩🤩🤩 WOW
You mean that bald guy creeping on us through that hole with his grandma   😭💀😭💀😂😂💀😭
Now it's time for a how it should have ended. Snyder's cut edition.
How justice league snyder cut should have ended  Hishe's Live stream
Wish they could have a time line split where they have this version of batman do his thing in justice league while the batman series reboots
Well, can u also upload of wandavision, like how wandavision should have ended...
The batman dreams part made me laugh so much because I can relate so much to that lol
Motorboating ww bruh she has nun to begin with
Yooo Marlon mason joker
AKJKAJAKJAKJAKJAKJAKAJKAJKA I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEED HOW IT SHOULD HAVE ENDEEED!
For the hishe, please have Darkseid say “fine, I’ll do it myself”
I couldn't make it past the three minutes of Supes screaming in slow motion at the beginning.....
LOL @ 1:51
I hope you will make an extended version of this!!!
You should’ve cut parts of this so you can make your own Snyder cut of this video on the Snyder cut
Martian manhunter Knightmate
I'm pretty sure lex figured out both of their identities in BvS
Still better than the Whedon tragedy.
You should make how aliens should have ended comedy recap
Zack should have really scrapped that last chapter.
You should do voice over for Godzilla vs kong
Conflicted that he called Superman "Kal"
All this new detail...that will never, ever see the light of day if Warner Brothers has anything to say about it.  Pity.
As someone who hasn't seen the original movie, should I watch the Snyder cut?
1:20
man, if you guys got any better at these, my head would explode! because, "none of it has mattered, up to this point!" lol  you guys are AWESOME!!! LONG LIVE HISHE!!!!!
This had me in stitches. Amazing work
release the Snyder cut HISHE!!!!!!!
@HowItShouldHaveEnded, can you do one of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children for how it should and ended and with your own dubs please? Thank u 💖
LOLOLOL
Now waiting for screen junkies honest trailers of ZSJL.
I want to see darkseid and thanos having a little friendly chat in the villains pub :P
marthan manhunter
Hope you guys do WandaVison next on how should it ended
Please do a King Kong versus Godzilla
This was part 2 Snider cut... Haha! When are you all going to realize ... Spoiler alert😜
Funny how superman says Batman’s getting a reboot when the same is happening with him.
We need more byte-sized recaps!!
"The Batman" is not a reboot, it just other retelling story of batman... is it?
good point - did batman ever tell anyone else about his dreams/bat dreams/bat prophecy dreams?
Queremos a continuação! ]
What if you can create a new channel called “How games should have ended”
For the wandavision hishe. Please tell me Batman gonna ask why vision put people back in Wanda control after release them.
That Batman sounds like Pete Holmes xD
are y'all going to do WandaVision
Because Im Batman
Wandavision
We are forgetting that everybody knows Clark Kent is Superman now.
What will be your next video?
Because I am Batmannnnnnnn
How is this video better than the actual movie?
Batman shouldn’t have been over the Martha
Snyder is a zionist shill.
Lol awesome
Suicide Squad (2016) The Suicide Squad (2021) Thy Suicide Squad  (Later)
# hishe Wandavision
maybe you sshould make snyder cut HISHE
Imagine if HISHE made a 4 hour long animated version of the Snyder Cut
It was a solid 1.5 hour movie that would have left us all wanting more.. padded out to a 4 hour snooze fest that you thought was over and kept going on and on.
I love it everytime batman makes an appearance on this channel - much love ❤️
I really need hishe JL Snyder cut
We can have BOTH. We WOULD watch both.
Wait, Snyder Batman believes in prophecy dreams? So much for Batman being a scientist I guess. At this point, am I really surprised how much Snyder doesn’t know anything from the characters he puts to screen?
Just show me darkseid talking to thanos in the villain pub.
Yooooooooooooooooooooo you huys cheer me up from anzity in the night
But there are no writers in the DC universe and the MARVEL universe
Lmfao I love this.
I am disappointed it is not 4 mins long
I'm really disappointed , why darkseid is not in this video hishe ?
I'm deeply disappointed that it's not a 4 hours long HISHE
That is simultaneously the most accurate and least accurate portrayal of Robert Pattinson's batsuit ever.
Snyder Cut changed the way we have been seeing Superhero movies
It's bad dreams
Türk Olanlar Bi Kendini Belirtirse Sayımızı Bilelim!
This channel is technically  “If superheros actually used their brain”
Yes yes😅 I was expecting this, ty ty... bows❤️❤️❤️❤️
Do godzilla vs king Kong how it should have ended pls
im disappointed because you guys  haven’t made a wandavision HISHE 😡 😡 😡
Is batman voiced by Pete holmes?
Hey please  can you make a video on what if Thor and hulk are the part of civil war??
When he said Cal I thought he was cartman for a second
You need to do how attack on titan should have ended
Marvel Marshon Man hunter.
I want to see the Knightmare story played out more than most things in media.
oh Kal-El, wait til you meet Granny Goodness and her Furries =D
Thank you Mr. Snyder. THAT really was, and is, a great movie... and thank you HISHE for this too :)
It was obvious Lex knew Batman’s identity since BvS.
Release the HISHE CUT lol. Actually release some more Villian Pub! 😁
Fake! They don't even talk in slo mo.
This should've been at least 6 mins and 46 seconds long
Batman I'm batman always haha
Lol
I'm putting on my goggles Kal!!
This is the best thing I’ve seen in awhile. Couldn’t stop laughing! “They’re not bad dreams, they’re BAT dreams! “
Honestly, you guys need to do a "How Would Weedon Cut It" channel.
They should do a how WandaVision should have ended
"Here we go with your dreams again " 😂😂😂😭😭😭
One of the best Superhero cafe clips in a while :)
😆 "...bat prophecy dreams."
.. and I cuss now
Sooooo what’s the Snyder cut change? Did it make it go from a mess to great or just a longer mess?
😂😂😂😂
2 more hrs but yeah no suspense at all or any feel of danger at all, so they got the 3 boxes and yet they stil had time to chill, superman to go shopping for a new suit , movie is good but  just as good as any action movie
After watching the movie. Finally I can watch this now
Bro are you really telling the whole movie spoiler im glad that i watch the snyder cut after watching this
"I cuss now"
WB would make the biggest mistake in the world to not make more JL movies.
We want a hishe Review!!!!
Good job 👍
Yeah it's actually good now Zack Snyder saved the franchise
First time I saw HISHE just praise a film. Hahaha!
Is voice of Batman, Batdad?
Watch the snyder cut not get a sequel and none of these details ever get flushed out
The episode on the cut should be 2x as long
Marthan Manhunter
not just adding 2 hours changed it!!
Do hishe for wandavision
dude i wanna watch this so bad
Aaeemm... no
1:59 how I thought the next movie must be, flash, flash
Congratulations on 10mil
After Batman v Superman there will be a Batman v Batman where Affleck's Batman  will try to erase Pattinson's Batman out of existence.
I really wish they will continue DCEU with all their main cast henry cavil, ben afleck, jason momoa, etc... and yes including jared letto..
So instead of having wet dreams his having bat dreams?
Just add the slow motion and this clip will be at least 3 hours long!
"Not these kind of prophecy dreams" "They are BAT prophecy"
Supe: "WOW" BatMan: "YEAH"
Are they recasting Affleck?
🤣🤣🤣dope man🔥
“What a crazy amount of new detail!” 🤣🤣🤣
That is a crazy new amount of detail 😁😜
The only issue I have is lex already new Bruce Wayne's name in BVS That's how he got them to fight each other
I want to see Darkseid in the HISHE Animation
in bvs luther knows who is batman，it is not surprise
I believe jimmy kimmel met bruce, clark & lex was the missing ultimate cut. Bruce was cursing, jimmy's big mouth told lex about bruce's batman & clark's superman.
How it should ended plants vs zombies pls
Body you are one of the craziest and most creative person in the world😂👍👏
S E E D S
Bald guy with  his grandma 🤣🤣
WTF darkside description was hilarious😂😂😂
This should've had 2 hours added too
Iron-man, Batman and their dreams
The bald guy who was creeping on us through the portal with his grandma
Does this mean that you guys will do a HISHE about it
The change in aspect ratio was just [chef’s kiss]
Will the darkseid dreams be like Batman always mentioning at one moment but no one takes him seriously and then darkseid arrives out of nowhere and Batman will be like: See I was right I’m always right BECAUSE I AM BATMAN
Cool
So is it Snyder or synder
how spiderman 1 should have ended
We need the snyderverse reinstated!!!!
And Martian Manhunter?
That "GLORIOUS" 4:3 aspect ratio!!!!!! :) (I knoooOOoooow!)
" that bald man creeping on us with his grandma"
What if Lois's baby daddy is actually Bruce Wayne like Snyder originally planned?
What if Jimmy Kimmel's "Batman v Superman deleted scene" sketch was actually made canon in Snyderverse and that's how Lex Luthor knows Batman's name 😂😂😂
How wandavision should have ended?
I just cant wait for Darkseid introduction to the Villains Pub!
Snyder cut Hishe pls
So practically you should make a movie for every character, to give more depth, before they assembled in one movie... Hmmm....sounds like what the other studio doing...
🥚
2:15 that transition is sick! 🔥 It really preserved the artistic vision of Zack! 🙌
Like seriously. That prophesy thing got me.
Putting on goggles is destiny ! It's the prophecy batman  Details
I don't think those new "The Batman" ears are going to cut it or Pattison.
restorethesynderverse
And now I don't have to waste 4 hours....
I've watched this . My destiny is fulfilled . It's filled with dark seeds.
_Why is nobody talking about the fact the Mera has an accent now??_
"Oh and I cuss now. And I have to roll with this Joker. And I cuss now. What a crazy amount of new detail!"
Snyder cut (should be called "Snyder's remake", because isn't really a director's cut): make to JL a thing that the original movie lacks: a script.
Anybody noticed the display ratio was same as that of Snyder cut? 2:20
Because I'm Batman🦇🦇🦇
I'm disaponted is not in 4:3 🙃
i'm still waiting for HISHE give a story to why batman still wearing his mask in knightmare why not just became bruce wayne
So is this movie worth the watch now?
Can you do a how it should’ve ended of the first Batman movie with micheal Keaton
Not impressed
I watched this before I watched Snyder's cut, and yeah... Snyder deserves an Oscar. What a movie.
First
This Movie is EPIC!! I FINISHED WATCHING IT. SO FAR It's the BEST SUPERHERO ASSEMBLY ORIGIN MOVIE I EVER SEEN.
Guys I think Batman cussed
There was still some issues and complaints Ofc but overall synder cut lived up to the hype, such a better movie then the original
that aspect ratio
"THE Batman"
*"you mean that bald guy that was creeping on us through the portal with his grandma?"*
1. You might be the funniest guy in America. 2. You understand these characters more than anybody at Warner Bros. 3. Yes, the brown tint shift was awesome. 4. Bat-prohecy dreams.. you just dropped the mic!
ah my head
Forgot to disavow geeks and gamers for playing alt right yachtzees
Because I am Batman? - because you're about to reboot! Because I am The Batman  That part killed me lol :')
lol
The Snyder Cut HISHE had better be twice as long as the Justice League HISHE
Do "How Monster University Should Have Ended" please☺
Jimmy Kimmel is to blame
More like this! Those HISHE dub videos with the Space Angel mouths are just too disturbing.
Snyder cut is actually worse than the original because it's just the original, but even slower, thereby wasting more of your time.
Looks like Luthor gets his place finally at villian pub
Perfect
Stark dreaming about thanos Bruce dreaming about darkseid   What's up with billionaires and their prophecies?
The best part about The Batman rebooting.. is that, canonically, Darkseid doesn't give a *cuss* about alternate timelines and universes. Darkseid is a new god. Darkseid is Darkseid, throughout all universes. Darkseid.. is.
*Everyone* Wanting more Darkseid invasion stuff cause Bat's is losing it. *Me laughing my head off knowing it was Manhattan all along.
Batman: Oh F*** it’s the Joker! Oh and I cuss now.
So this is why his earth parents , kevin conster n martha couldn t have kids. The martian manhunter was martha.  And when she went to work she was in the gov that general.   Nice.   Oh wait ...that means...OMFG 😮
Prophecy dreams about the coming of a major badass boss villain? Cmon now Tony...  ... I mean Bruce
Batman is right, I DO wanna see what happens next! LOL! The Bat-goggles DEMAND it.  Ps- Oh and if Marvel can use "quantum" as their go to "because" DC can use "multiverse", the Bat-Goggles DEMAND it!
I like how Batman cursed twice because they dropped the f bomb two times in the film
Wild theory: I think its darkseid himself or even the anti-life equation that gave Batman those dreams, for some reasons ofc
waiting for hishe snyder cut
The Yellow taxi behind is bastered with barman and superman .
2:47  Oh cuss is the joker.! Oh and I cuss  now ! I have to roll with this joker and  I cuss now ! Cuss What a crazy amount of new details !
Funny 😆 a cussing Batman that funny makes me laugh out loud
Would Darkseid join Villain Pub?
Anyone else see the thumbnail and say "cuss" in the batman voice?
After all the craziness in Batman's history, cussing is very mundane.
You should make a how it should have ended for Wanda vision!
Awwwwww, I can't,  you get me everytime.. okay I'm going to press play. But please let me enjoy it for just a little while....please....
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Are we not going to talk about the Joker being courteous enough to give Batman a reach around?
Are you gonna do a video for Wandavision????
"I'm putting the goggles on!"
Batman: I cuss now!
We need a HISHE for WandaVision
What... I was early... I didn’t realise it... now I’m late...
There should  be a JL2.. "Not joss Wheddon" We want Zack snyder's kind of justice league..
Nice joke when te video changes
those two to three dreams i had
MARTHA MANHUNTER
I actually got invested when I saw batman w/ goggles
Quickly to the bat-bed for the bat-dreams that allow us to know the future through the bat-prophocies.
I'm disappointed that Snyderverse isn't canon...
"Darkseid is not an issue." Justice League: War and Justice League Dark: Apokolips War said hello.
If you need references to the Talmud's supremacism, then check out this book about the war between the "Sons of Light" and the "Sons of Darkness" : "Beware the World to Come" by Christopher Jon Bjerknes.
LMFAO this was another great one guys, bravo!
Batman: Look, I'm putting on a duster. That means we're in the knightmare now. Superman: Come on, man. Take off the duster. Batman: I'm not taking off the duster! Okay!?
你爸爸年纪
1509 angel number
I kinda wanna see this cafe in live action now
NOTHING MATTERS ANT THAT THE TRUTH 😂
this is epic 😂 how it started 😂
So, are prophetic dreams a part of Batman's skill set?
I'm tired of the Christian Bale impersonation. Rather go for an Adam West or Kevin Conroy Version.
Too lazy to read the comments to suggest that darkseid cant beat superman but he can destroy him by killing lois.
The bald guy is the purple guy from that other hero movie
Voice actors can audition for South Park
*I am putting my googles kal"*  why is he suddenly calling superman Kal?  also Henry's dog is named Kal...as in after superman
Thanks now I don't have to watch the actual movie.
*Bat dreams!*
Is there a Snyder cut of this? If so, please release it
And I cuss now
Please do more super cafe
Release the Snyder Cut of the Super Cafe - Snyder Cut
Supe and Bat wearing plain ol wartime colours
Who else loved the Synder cut and wanna see more of batfleck 🙋
Now i need a Batman Batsplaining the entire premise of the new batman movie.  TOO MANY DETAILS
God I've missed these
I AM BATMAN
Congratulations for 10m subscribers !
how wandavision should've ended
Mr. Wayne has a skitzoid disorder
Wait I don't get what is this about. Pls explain. Is there like another movie coming out? 🤔😂
Waiting for godzilla vs kong hishe
Hey Guys Where Is The Villian Pub Scene I was Expecting that
Zack Snyder already made a HISHE of 2017 Justice League.
BRAVO
1)I'm with Superman  2) whay he callhem kal ?
batman sounds like jak and daxter
Jesus Christ loves you all so much. Come to him today! Accept him as your Lord and Savior. Jesus died on the cross for us 2021 years ago so that we may be free from our sins through him. Believe on him and Trust him! Repent and surrender to him. He is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
Where have I heard a billionaire without powers having nightmarish dreams about aliens invading earths again   HMMMM
love
0:38 She's MARTHA Manhunter     Oh Is that the door?  I'll be leaving now
After seeing snyder cut, i kind of strtd to like the ben affleck batman😅😅
funny one...
Why are rebooted batmans ears so big?
So... is it FINALLY worth watching? And most importantly, are there any movie one should watch before watching it? Havent seen any yet.
Batman: "these are not bad dreams they are bat dreams"😁
Jimmy Kimmel told Lex Luthor Batman's real name
Me still waiting for how the Incredible Hulk should’ve ended
Copas
i was a little upset the video ended weak but then i remembered, so did the movie.
We thank you for the support and encouragement
This is how the movie should have ended.
Love this batman
"Mother Martha turned into Martha Man Hunter"
I have a question: Why is this HISHE not 16:20 long? Because the original was 08:10 (alternatively are you going to release another version of this in a week that is 06:46 ?)
"Dark seeds"
Let’s face it the next big MCU movie is now going to be like 5 hours now
Unpopular opinion: This movie should have been 3 hrs long, not 4. There was an excesive and pointless  amount of slow motion that just dragged the movie. The soundtrack is just all over the place and repetitive, I cringed in every battle scene with Diana because the Amazon lament was used every single time with no regard of the context of the scene. We could also take time to discuss possible plot holes but... Lets not.  Still a better movie than the original (guess this is not correct because this is the original... Ok. It is better than the theatrical cut), but not the perfect movie that everyone said it was.
Batman and Joker <3
“These are BAT dreams” Me: Huh, more like BAD dreams
Can't be the Snyder cut, it needs to be at least 4 hours longer
Can we have a how Snyder cut should have ended??
"Knightmare"
Wow, thanks for confirming that I was right to skip watching this mess.
I want to see the bat prophecy
So, is it worth a rewatch?
Martha Manhunter...HAHAHA!
Lex luthor knows bruce wayne is batman from batman vs superman
It looks like Batman's superpower in Zack Snyder's movies is precognition. He dreamed about para-demons and Flash travelling back in time before any of that really happened.
So are we just getting this or are we also getting a synder cut hishe?
How did you guys upload so fast.
Korean sub plz...
I loved the Snyder cut of Justice League! I'm so sad we'll never get to see his vision for the DCEU completed.
Jokes aside, the joker voice over is pretty good
🤣🤣🤣
I really wanna see a part 2 bad and I wasn’t clamoring for this
THE BELLS CANT BE UNRUNG!! DING DING DING
Batfleck is the Batman
Is the voice actor for Batman the same guy who did the Batman skits for College Humor many years ago?
The BAT Dreams, i rolled
Snyder cut is Hishe of Justice Leagues
Hey Hishe i luv this video! But i have a question. Are you going to how wandavision (sorry if i spelled it wrong) should have ended? Because the only thing i have been looking forward to in wandavision is watching how it should have ended! Thank u for hearing me out! :3
Zack Snyder's Justice League Is A Masterpiece
THE Batman was real from 2004 to 2008, he was young and cool ^^
Make the HISE Cut where it’s 6:46 long and has longer versions of every scene please 😂
"Because I'm Batman" 😂
“You mean that bald guy who was looking through the portal with his grandma?” 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 omfg I’m dead ☠️
LOL omg the Joker bit was absolutely priceless xD
What if Martian Man hunter showed up as Martha Wayne for Bruce and gave him a heart to heart?
Probably Amanda told to Lex Luther who is Batman.
The Superman and Batman at the cafe are the ones we need to have a DC movie
Martha is Martian man hunter? Did I miss something in the movie?
Warner is making bad decisions and cancelling the Snyderverse will backfire on them hard.  I heard that the movies going forward will all be directed by JJ Abrams.
Lex let Bruce knew who he really was in BvS during the jail cell scene.
Whole movie was boring except joker scene  That's why marvel is booming
Dude, snyder, thanks
If this film pulls throught we might get a better cinematic universe than marvel.
Is it possible to do How Godzilla vs. Kong have ending next time？
Im sorta dispointed it wasent 4 minuet hishe
God dammit I actually really like afflecks  Batman now I want to see more of him. Why didn’t they just use the Snyder cut it’s great
Justice League Dark: Apokolips War.... Earth is ruined, many heros are dead or crippled... And flash went back in time
lol Martha man hunter
Ready the armada, hishe. We are going to war against wb. For jl2 amd jl3. For Autumn. For Darkseid.
Seeing this hishe, superman says "Not Impressed".
Will there be HisHe cut of this!?😝😂
Nice question mark
Too bad the snyder cut isn't considered canon
so how many jokers do we have now
oh no, thats why i didnt know you uploaded because I haven't subscribe
I THOUGHT THAT THIS VIDEO WOULD BE LONGER :(
Superman: you should listen the batman.
Do how synder cut should have ended..
It's disappointing episode
Can you please do a “How Soul from Disney’s Pixar should have ended”
Darkseid is gonna snap his fingers in the next justice league movie
How wandavision Should Have End
Congratulations on 10 million subscribers 🥳
Love that when the ratio switched you could actually see more of the top and bottom of the frame
Hi
So when does “How Zack Snyder’s Justice League Should Have Ended” come out?
When I heard Batman tell Joker "I'm going to kill you" I had a flashback to Michael Keaton vs Jack Nicholson.
Thats how it should have ended
The probable population disappointingly bare because pajama gergely flood afore a decorous rub. thundering, scattered cemetery
Glad they didn't fall under the delusion the cut is good
Not impressed...  Haha
Martha manhunter
Respect for keeping the Battinson ears in 1:50. I’m dying lmao
*...Thanks For Adding Car Noises!!!...*
Is that pete holmes voicing batman ?
Why didn't BATMAN just say the name Martha when superman was lazaring him? That worked for super man 🤣🤣🤣
Yup.  That's basically it.  Still, it was really cool to see Cyborg actually have a story this time.
Dude I want a injustice movie
I'm like the prophet
"Martha Manhunter isn't real, she can't hurt you."  Zack Snyder: "Hold my Beer."
Batman is technically a furry.
Bro please put a Tamil subtitle in your videos bro please
Haha.. nice tranzition to 4:3
Thanks. For not spoiling it somehow.
Why is iron man 2 HISHE in the description?
Lex said the "good people at Arkham gave him clarity", and then gave away batman's identity.  I'd say he heard it from one of the people that batman put away.
When it showed Lois with the pregnancy test I just kept thinking that the next movie gonna be about superboy and robin
Funny how I just saw the movie
Batman: OH F#@% it’s the Joker !
So...where can I watch the Snyder Cut? Is it even out yet?
'you mean the bald guy that was creeping on us through the portal with his grandma'  lol
Snyder cut long but Snyder cut good.
Batman Prophecy dreams😂😂🔥
This is better than entire snydercut
I thought bvs batman is good enough to have a stand alone movie
Batman has an ongoing battle with throat cancer
Ausitm
Inwiah Snyder's cut would've come out in the first place and we would've been watching the JL2 right about now. Or this was Marvel's plan to make endgame a blockbuster, nobody knows.
If you really think about it, ZS’s Justice League is already a live action HISHE of Justice League
flash is the most powerful dceu hero. Reason: he can even defeat superman. But he is just a rookie in justice league but as times goes and he learns new powers. He will have learned enough to be the most powerful hero.
🌐 Good
Kalelno!
I love how in the end they slowly change the screen color that it took me a while to get the reference
MOTHER MARTHA TURNED INTO MARTHA MANHUNTER????!??!??? 😂😂😂
mother martha turned into martha manhunter.........best line
Batman: mother Martha turned into Martha manhunter Me: lol
Martha Manhunter
Maybe it’s too much work but in honor of the movies runtime which is twice as long. The synder cut of HISHE should be twice as long as the OG one
Brilliant Video. Showing both of sides of Audience's reactions. But, I really wanna watch another Best Picture Summary, since the nominations have been released. Cool Video though!!!!
Fantastic
I like This café
Hishe why do you always have to make fun of movies?
Why Batman gotta sound like that... these are bad dreams... bad dreams  😂
Dc has so much potential. This recent stuff ain’t cutting it
Bro you gotta make longer this common on  Please, like 10 mins at least  Click like you want HISHE to make 10 min video about 4 hour JL movie  Help people common let’s go
It was Amazing 🤩 I love how he calls him Kal
Lol love it
restorethesnyderverse  latino america esta presente unidos nada nos puede parar
Me and my friend stayed up till 3 watching justice league
Where can u watch this?
The DCU is becoming more complex than the x-man movies
Awesome. The DC Live Action properties take place within a Multiverse (canonically) though, so we can have multiple versions of the same character going forward.
Get ready for a 6-part Snyder Cut Hishe
Do Raya And The Last Dragon
Sounds a lot like the college humor Batman. And that’s a good thing!! Lol
I legit didn't know they still made these?!?!
Bat dreams. Dreams that demand the outcome  👏👏
没得字幕
Nice.
"I'll be your friend, heh heuh huh" "Oh f**k! It's The Joker... oh and I cuss now"
"When I find myself in times of trouble... *Mother Martha Martian Manhunter* comes to me...."
Yeah, the Batman !!! 😂 thank you for doing this!!!
Bat dreams are made of these Who am I to disagree?
LOL The Dark Seed AHAHAHA!
کوس چی میگه رو دهن بتمن؟!؟؟ 😐😐😐😐😐😐
Why does this video seem like it is also 4 hours long....
So coooool 😂
Palpatine will have so much fun with Darkseid at Villain Pub.
The acidic cuban syntactically reject because blouse significantly suspect under a imaginary macaroni. craven, male sparrow
If there are prophecies how can time be reversed
And i cuss now
It just started from Frozen HISHE episode and now I'm binge watching almost everything!!! I enjoy Villain Pub and this Super Cafe XD great works, mate! Wish you all the good things!!
While it was a much better version of Justice League it was still pretty boring and dull.
i thought for sure batman was gonna say something about superman copying his style
Romans 5:8 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 10:9-10 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Romans 10:13 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
I'mma he's not wrong about that 🤔☹️
I hope WB lets Snyder make a sequel
“They are not dreams, they are prophecies”                                       -Batman
I love how batman took the cup with him outside the café
Theory: batmans timeline already changed in snyder cut, the dream he had was of his previous timeline, and the scene when he met martian manhunter was the new timeline
Can’t wait for Twilight Batman 😅
He's not totally rebooted yet as the Flash movie will bring Batfleck back along with Batkeaton to prolly finish off the knightmare storyline.
And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. Acts 16:30-31 Faith
Let’s boycott all WB films except Dune and The Batman cause those actually have a lot of potential. Everything else sounds like less interesting. We must for The Snyderverse, for Autum Snyder.
Plot twist: These two are cosplayers trying to explain the plot in the third person
The hype is getting serious.
By right and to give it the right respect..... This should have been 4 mins long ha ha
If you’re not involved in the sequel then DC have to get cancelled
For the Synder Cut HISHE they should name it How Justice League Should’ve Ended - HISHE Cut and just make it How Justice League Should’ve Ended but with extra HISHE parts that are from the extra scenes in Snyder Cut
Just saw the pitch meeting, waiting until it ends up on TNT. Hope the edit for time cuts a lot from this movie.
That was weird
<3 batman
︎︎︎︎︎︎
Another well deserved slap in Joss Whedon’s face.
HEY CAN YOU DO HOW ZOMBIELAND should have ended and how zombieland 2: double tap should have ended
......WHAT THE JUICE?! 😂
Boi I can’t wait for How Godzilla vs Kong should’ve ended!!!!
We live in a society.
Same cars making u turns in the background.
Watching the Snyder cut with my girlfriend, she though mother Martha actually WAS Martian Manhunter the whole time! Like some big twist! I told her no that's not the case but I had nothing to back that up. It just raises more questions. Was Manhunter Martha the whole time or some of the time? If he impersonated other people how long has he been on earth? If that's the case then why couldn't Batman find him and have him help while the planet was threatened 'x' number of times!? He was trying to put a team together after all.  I wondered how do you write a scene like that and not consider that someone who knows nothing about DC or these hero's wouldn't come to that conclusion?!  I know fans want to see everything from this cut but if you ask me this is one scene that should have been scrapped entirely and just have Martian Manhunter show up at the end just like he does as if he just arrived. Easy and done there you go.
@ 2:15 - from 16:9 ratio to 4:3
snyder cut be like THE WORLDS ABOUT TO END but here is a movie to distract you for 4 hours or so
“We live in a society.”
Sorry my head just swelled  up.. and explode................😵
ye... so that¨s what beating a dead horse looks like... messy
I'm batman
I've missed these
Awesome.
HOLY THEY MADE A COMBACK!!!
SAY BUTLER'S💯🇺🇸😍him'$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$=💯
10 MILLION SUBS
'The Darkseid seeds... The darkseeds...' 😂
Very *B A T* dreams !
If I could turn back time
My phoned dropped when the new rebooted batman showed up out of nowhere
DARKSEID IS.
I am from Russia, where can we watch russian version??
Martha Manhunter.
Brilliant, absolutely brilliant. Smiled all the way through this
Mother Martha 😂
there's gonna be a DCU but instead of thanos dark side 😂
We need how Zack Snyder's justice league should have ended
Your awesome bro lol
Can u make a jurassic park 3 and jurassic park 2 HISHE but if u could only make one can u make jurassic park 3 HISHE
Are we going to get the sequels
Only people who didn’t come from tiktok are worthy of liking this comment
I'm not going to say Batman and Iron Man having dreams that foreshadowed the bad guy...but yeah...I figure I might as well since time travel was also stolen from Avengers.
Wait until Superman finds out Batman impregnated Lois in the justice league 2 script, it’ll be Batman v Superman 2
I am gonna be so mad if they don't continue this stroyline now, They have a  chance to make DC great!
Jared did something incredible. You could hate him or love him, but that 'Boy-Man' delivery is by far the best Joker line. Like straight outta comics.
Because.... i'm BATMAN
Batman's dreams and his mug. Next week the joker has good dreams
Batman sounds like Patrick the star 😂😂
Love the fact that Marvel has 10 years of (mostly) consistent movies and DC can't make a proper sequel without any controversy backlash or last minute rewrith or reeddit.
Brilliant... And all done in 4:3 aspect ratio like the Pretentious Cut hahahaha
This whole episode is Batman having a mental breakdown over the Snyder Cut. It's hysterical.
That was funny! These dreams will totally come true! Well, we’ll see if The Batman is any good. I’m very worried.
Lmao 😂
how it slowly goes to 4:3 aspect when he wear the goggles.
Best movie of the year? Probably not. Most overrated movie of all time? Definitely.
That was quick
What  cuss
I like how this is accurate
When the scene suddenly switched to a fullscreen ratio, I thought he was gonna do a WandaVision!
What do you mean how does lex know Batman’s identity ?  Jimmy Kimmel told him.
The joker was so bad
Hi
"These are more than just dreams, these are prophecy" "Why do you think that?" "Because none of it has mattered up to this point"
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🔻
I’m guessing flash makes a suit and Batman realise it was a vision which makes him form the team based on what he saw. Would be great to see this film come to life
So funny I forgot to laugh
In the thumbnail if you replace the c in cuss it says suss!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😃
Thank you for not reading how it should have ended on Zack Snyder's Justice League , he's not making any money from it he's just doing it for fans and he has struggled alot
Me and my brother was like if this version had Superman and Batman in a cafe at the end it would be 10/0, but overall the film was 9/10 compared the orginal 1/10.
Waiting for godzilla vs kong hishe ⏳⏳⏳⏳
Ha! Even the aspect ratio changed! 😅
Didn't the goggles come with a jacket?
These are getting weak.
After I watch a movie I just wait for how it should have ended uploads
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Batman ears are still wonderful
When Batman switched to the rebooted Batman and came back, his ears still kept feeling long
THE PROPHECIES cannot be ignored !!!!!
Cause I'm f.....g Batman!
999,999 viewer<3
Zynder cut make me want Injustice
Wow 😯  Yeah 😒  Wow 😯  Yeah 😒
Why Batman sounds like trump?
Save us, Flash!  😱
What if it's actually martha pretending to be martian manhunter
I love the subtle change of the aspect ratio..lol
BECAUSE I'M BAT PROPHET!
That Bale voice is spot on my friend haha
Lex knew Batman´s name in BvS. He actually tells him when they are both talking in jail at the end.
Where's wandavision? Lol I can't wait till you guys make a HISHE
When the movie is so good, they can only sit at the cafe and talk about how mind-blowing things turned out.. and are itching to see what happens next.
Saved me a few hours, bless your kind heart
Do more dubs
Can't wait for The Darkseid to join Villain Pub
When batman says prophesies he should’ve said premonitions
To whomever is scrolling: sending you good vibes for the rest of the day or night. Thank you for reading!
😂😄🤣
FINALLY
Because he's batman
So Martian Manhunter was disguised as Martha. Does it make him...        MARTHIAN MANHUNTER?? I'll find an exit myself, thanks.
1:17 I thought he was gonna say “They’re Bat-dreams”
I'd watch a whole movie made by HISHE. 😁
*Dark seeds* lol
Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the kingdom of Heaven is near. Matthew 3:2  Jesus loves you! = ) Never give up on your life!!
Wandavision please
The Darkseeds...
i missed this so much
Hey I'm waiting for How Wandavision should have ended
So to recap, Zack Snyder STILL turns everything he touches into s***
The only thing I took away is “DARK SEEEEDS” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I haven’t seen the cut and probably won’t but..... wtf
Wait Batman is Broof now?
*YES*
"These are Bat Dreams" LOL
When's WandaVision coming?
Love it
This is too short. We need the Safe Cafe Cut!
Can u make a cartoon a bout batman going to fortnite
The Batman Prophecies vs The Mothman Prophecies
Warner brothers wants to break this all down....
This was hilarious. Love it.
Turn nightshift off
Marfan Manhunter.
The Bats gonna reboot lol😂
Darkseid in the Villains pup let it happen
Bat man voice TUBERCULOSIS
Well...that was short
mother Martha turn into martian manhunter 😂😂
After so long without Super Cafe, I'm just so happy. Thank you HISHE.
Ok
As a not knowing Person ... what is Snyders Cut?
Sneak peek of The Batman!
I see the HISHE writers forgot that Lex knowing Batman's identity was a plot point in BvS.
to be honest this channel makes every movies into HISHE movies. when will i watch on How HISHE Should have ended. XD
Wait, is Batman only having dreams because iron man had them 🤔
Snyders cut is a bootleg version of Avengers.....
After this video, I am now completely convinced that Batman has never had coffee in that mug.
finally
I should probably get around to watching the Snyder Cut at some point.  Hmm, I will need background noise this weekend when I start on leveling up Blue Mage.  Could be good for that.
Yes, who knew that 2 hours (A whole movie) would change so much.
And I say unto you: "Martian Manhunter being Mother Martha really made me a maniac."
Make the Snyder cut Canon now
I would chalk it up bad dreams too if I wasn’t an audience member and knew that when we’re shown a dream it’s rarely for no reason, lol
Honestly it was just two hours of extended footage with more Snyder edginess. The storyline was the same- they had to revive Superman to beat the bad guy.
How come u didn't do wanda vision
türkler buradamı 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Can you please upload HISHE of wandavision
ohh well i am not gonna this much better than original
God I've missed the Super Café!
ZSJL Movie is so good
"These are Bat dreams" 😂
Mad max!!!! 😂, anyone get it LoL
This definitely should be considered cannon
Batman: Because I am THE Batman.  Captain America: Language!  Superman: Grammatical problems! I don't mind.
As if Zack Snyder planted those details just so fans would make more noise and ask for the continuity.... The. Seeds. Have. Been. Planted.
We need Shazam and Green lantern too, in the next snyder cut.
I about lost it with the aspect ratio change at the end 😂
Loved how the ratio changed :)
am i the only one thinks that the batman voice in this video better than justice league?
Wandavision HISHE: nothing its perfect, please do that
-knightmare- Bat dreams
Lot of new detail but still meh.
It's not just adding 2h, it's keeping only 20 minutes because the 2017 movie was so bad.
Nice joke about dark sups suite Totally as value in movie
We live in a society batman!!
Actually it's shown in BvS that Luthor knew who Batman actually was. He was sending the mailed taunts TO BRUCE WAYNE.
so.... Not mentioning that now Justice League have kind of the same movie plot of the Avengers first movie? Not even that they look a lot more alike now and they'll probably do a lot of stuff kind of alike what the MCU already did?  Darkside true villain revelation ≈ Thanos true villain revelation The Dreams of Batman ≈ The Dreams of Tony Stark the heart thing (I'm trying to not spoiler stuff) ≈ the infinity stones  Martian Manhunter ≈ Captain Marvel  and we could go a lot more (but any deeper explaining or more detailed analysis might spoiler stuff) so I'll just trow few. I'm not saying that they are the same or one of the two movies is lame, but looks like both movies have done like two child that copyed the same text for an exam and changed it to look different enough to not get caught by their teacher.
E
The Flash reversing time thing. I've never seen that before. He's near enough a beginner and yet I've watched the tv version box set so many times and he made the powers look so much better
"What is a crazy amount of new details" For the people who haven't watched the snyder cut yet ( including me)
LOLOL, mother Martha killed me
The abortive tablecloth grossly judge because foam intralysosomally try excluding a zealous lumber. quizzical, odd octagon
So... Batman and Superman are both the children of Martha Manhunter?
Zack Snyder, setting up INJUSTICE since 2016.
Martha turn into Martha manhunter
I guess he saw that apocalypse animated movie.
Except the Knightmare sequence this time around was hinting at the Injustice storyline. In fact, I've always figured that's what the original one was too, Lois being "the key". It's her death while pregnant that makes supes go mad. Although he does kill Joker almost right away. Ah who am I kidding? I know nothing
Where are their mask!?
Lex knew bruce name since bvs
Omg I was just thinking about how your version of it would turn out then boom here you are
People waiting for sequel of synder cut... won't happen.
Lol the screen turning into a square so it looks like the synder cut
Am I the only one who was super annoyed at how square the movie was... like I spend money on a good wide hd tv and they were like "Hey you know what would be cool, if we, like, used only half of the screen"
“Lois might be pregnant!” Oh good god, that may not end well. If you know, you know.
Anyone knows what is the software they are using for creating these amazing cartoon?
Do wanda vision  How it should have ended
What a crazy amount of details😂
I cuss now!
What happen if Mother Martha is actually Martian Manhunter? Not Martian Manhunter disguised as Mother Martha? So, who was the one married with Jonathan Kent? That’s why they didn’t have a kids... 😱😱😱😱
We all know the bat mug prophecies are the most accurate.
Restarting same thing again and again. It's gets boring. I even don't care about Superman, Batman anymore or justice League whatever.
Thank you.
the only hope that he continues snyder verse is jason kilar head of all warner along with att, they love zack snyder and I'm sure he will continue, they will sacrifice warner for snyder
...is no one going to talk about how this is one of their shorter cafe videos talking about one of the longest movies they've discussed?
Batman: what we need is a suit of armor around the world
Love it
JOHN WICK PLZ I TAKE. BACK WHAT I SAID AT THE LAST VIDEO
70k -600 😌
New villian pub? With new joker? Plz?
Still waiting on WandaVision 😁😏
0:43, WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME!!!
Martha manhunter LMOA
Hope I see Ben instead of Robert in justice league 2
I would watch a 4 hour cut of just batman and superman sitting in the cafe talking about random stuff
The details in this video is effin great !! That screen ration that synder set, its effin awesome.
The Martha man hunter 👽👽👽
just one nitpick the 4:3 or 1:33:1 does not cut the 16:9 it actually adds the top and bottom
I haven’t seen the movie and I don’t really care
Hey I was looking forward to see darkseid in villans pub
Best video yet!
Yeah this video was great and everything but.... HOW WANDAVISION SHOULD HAVE ENDED!!!! I DEMAND IT NOW!!!!!!
Not these kind of dreams,these are bat dreams😂
Mother Martha Martian Man Hunter
How does he know my name? Did you tell him😂
It could be dreams of an alternate universe.
Bat dreams 😂😂
warner bros make this a series on hbo max
In the year 2027, we'll all be demanding the Syder cut of the DCEU injustice movie.
I forgot how unfunny these really are
Seriously, I heard all the spoilers, but I don't really care.
man....I really did miss the Super cafe.
I liked how intimidating Steppenwolf was until I noticed he had those adorable glossy eyes like a funko pop toy.
＼(^-^)／
Why HISHE? I haven’t even got to watch Snyder cut and then this comes out. Bat fist comes out of screen. Hits me in the face. “Because I’m Batman”
I wanna see steppenwolf talking to Darkseid in the villain pub like "dude wtf?"
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You r the best from india
I really wanted to see Darkseid invading earth, but I guess best I can do is dreaming
I'm Sleepy
Good
“What a crazy amount of new details!” Best line
Martha Manhunter
I missed Super Cafe :D
He has returned...
Mera accent 😂
TBH I am watching this coz now I guess I'll never watch DC
Release the HISHE Synder Cut
i really really missed this cafe❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ and  I'M BATMAN😁😁
The Batman's ears are a little too much.
next time i see a DC movie it’ll be the Batman movie where the entire DCEU will be rebooted... i think? Idk exactly, DC weird
Not gonna lie, I want to know what happens. I want to see a sequel.
I think we should bring our blankets to cinema 2 more hours?!?!?😂😂
This did not get a single laugh
Dark seeds :P
The darkseid seeds..... " THE DARKSEEDS"
YOU FORGOT MARTHA
Do toy story 4 ended Sleepy beauty..and the others cartoons of disney ..there are só many..
In short: Snyder cut is awesome
Helo
"You mean that bald guy that was creeping on us through the portal with his grandma? That guy took off like a wuss.”  Literally my reaction to that scene xD! I liked Steppenwolf, but Darkseid was meh. Everything cool we see about him is in dreams, so it's not like he actually did anything relevant.
HTF??? Did I miss Martha Manhunter😂😂😂
Martha Manhunter 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I imagine batman's legs remained bent in a seated position even after you couldn't see them anymore
I love how they kept the aspect ratio too lol
I was expecting to see Ryan Reynolds as GL at the end credit scene bonking the Joker's head while he's edgily talks back to the Bat.
Anyone gonna point out The Batman's ears???
super cafe is back yaay
Idky, but everytime a show has that censored noise to cancel out the bad word. Makes it even more funny 😂😂 I wasn't expecting to hear that lmao this channel hadn't sworn in so many years it feels like
The dreams demand the outcome!!!!
WoW indeed
I thought it was a parrel reality flash made by messing with time
3:05 someone plz give me this full music
Nothing about Batman being pregnant with Lois?
They just threw all the spoilers in the beginning
PLOT TWIST: wb ceo watched this vedio
Lex knew batmans identity in BVS  thats hiw he set both of them up. It is also how he invited them both to his party. The prequel comics explain this.
Martha Man hunter
why is christian bale in the snydercut?
Why is Batman still speaking like that? Isn't this voice from the Christian Bale Batman in the Nolan trilogy?
Make how Godzilla vs Kong should have ended
Flash broke through the glass because windows no longer supports Flash.
So much details!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
BRILLIANT 🤣🤣🤣
I'm REEEAALLLLYYY gonna miss Ben Affleck as batman. He was amazing in that role.
"I'm putting on my goggles Kal it's destiny!" 🤣😂😁
This Joker can stay permanently in Villain Pub series.
I hate Christian bales Batman voice
I can't wait for the Injustice movie    (If it happens)
This is awesome
Everything about this is brilliant
Batman 😂
türkçe alt yazıı ?
The broad is this picture looks like Nancy Pelosi
the 4:3 aspect ah yess
The only thing bad about Zack Snyder's Justice League : It was just 4 hours long
I just had a dream Joe Biden kissed me, my ex-g/f got eaten by an alligator, i dove into some ancient mayan river in a jungle to get away and there was a giant albino anaconda at the bottom of it, and my current g/f was accusing me of cheating on her with my ex who got eaten by the alligator.... dissect that one for me lol
Now the zack snyder's justice league is complete
"not these kind of dreams, do you know why?"  "BECAUSE I AM BATMAN"
Response to Batman: "Dont let your dreams be dreams!!"
Im fine with chalking them down as bad dream that just lead to Batman forming the League and moving on
DO A FULL FLEDGED VIDEO
I'm angry with you for not promoting me on my youtube channel😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
I watched this video on 0.5x playback just to get the full Snyder Cut experience.
Idk what happend you tell me

I'll bet the Snyder cut has Ben Affleck thinking about making a graceful reentrance...
I was hoping that the rest of the Justice League would have been in the Super Cafe too. I was looking forward to you guys mocking Amber Heard’s Mera’s sudden British accent. 😂. Hoping that you guys do a HISE cut of the Zack Snyder’s Justice League
Restore the snyderverse!
So... is it the... Snyder cafe?
Im pissed they didn't include 《We live in a society in the movie》..
“No one cared who I was til I put on the goggles”
Wow
Restore the Snyderverse
Hishe on Wandavision
finally! another super cafe!
Marvel fans left the chat
a mad max future, hm, what would deathstroke do...
Spongebob has left the chat
Will be so much happy if steppy, darkseid and desaad appears in villain cafe
41 horse yess
1:48 because you're bout to reboot *Batman 2021* 😂
No actual cuss word used, disappointed.
Been waiting for this!!!
We live in a society
Do Wanda vision next
Bruh *I never though that darkside had a grandma*
give us part 2
To be fair, Mera's accent was like that in the Whedon cut too. It's the Aquaman movie that changed it for some reason.
Everybody Gangsta till Darkseed shows up.
So weird. I just read about this scene and came on YouTube to watch it and then this parody was at the top of the page.
because none of it matters.... i think thats the first time ive heard batman say because and not end it with well uk
Martha manhunter 😂😂😂
Yeah, it's amazing that anyone thought ballooning the runtime out to four hours would fix any of the problems with the movie.   Honestly 3 hours is the absolute maximum amount of time a movie should run, but even then the first half of those 3 hours has to be good enough that the audience wants to sit through the second half. If you can't tell a good story in an hour and a half you shouldn't be a filmmaker.
Let’s be honest we all want a Knightmare Batman movie
1:51 the ears might be too much 😂
The whole fridge effectively ask because brake happily fancy via a rampant charles. naive, needy stove
Make a ''How It Should Have Ended: The Mandalorian Season 2''
ok funny and stuff but lex luthor already knew both of their identities in BvS
If Snyder have the will and the strength, I would like another mini-series please
What if... The Batman is just going to be a part of the multiverse?
I love you 😂😂
Congratulations on your 10 million subscribers!
the batman is a prequel
The seeds have been planted Lois !  I mean Kal ! The bat-seeds... I mean the Darkseid seeds !
спасибо, вы зачет
I had a dream...almost like a premonition...
I loved how the picture changed to 4:3 as Batman puts on the glasses :D
this video was better than josstice league
0:10 no guys, people still get it wrong, 2 hours wasnt added to the movie, the Snyder cut was a different movie and the 2017 was a different one.
God, I missed the cafe!!!
Accurate
Martha-Mother turn into Martha-Manhunter Damn XD XD
Bruh this is trending lol
Batsy: i just notice you copied my suit color kallel
Zack Snyder JL HISHE Whennn 😭😭😭
1:20 Because..            I'M BATMAN!
More sad than angry I am. Like when Xmen movies kinda take a downfall
Dark seeds🤣
We want wanda visions hishe
dreams dream the outcome 😂
this was better than josstice league
2:16 perfect switch in the aspect ratio 😁
Called it martha manhunter!
Who would've known..? I can tell you who SHOULD have known!
Waiting to see Darkseid in Villain Pub
That seagull laugh at 2:45 was really life-like!
batman trying to portray iron man in dreams
I think now they should start giving hindi subtitles  Who agree   🕉⤵
Love how after batman puts on his goggles the sepia dream filter fades in
This is hilarious. 🤣🤣🤣
Dude the batman and snider verse is seperate they are not the same so if they wanted to continue sniders batman whille still making pattinson's batman then it's very possible and do-able.
Where is Deadpool/Green Lantern?
Thank you for all the videos!!!!
No one should ignore the BAT DREAMS!
Lex knew about Bateman's identity since BvS. That's how and why he intercepted the cheques going to the wheelchair dude.
Honestly, these two are my absolute favourite version of these characters.
It must happen
"The" Batman. "The" Suicide Squad.   The disappointment.
Yes more super cafe
Images u walk by and see that happen irl
Thank you and God bless
Too bad none of it matters since it’s been announced that the Snyder-verse is dead
Lmaoooooooo
Is that Pete Holmes doing the Batman impression?
Mother Martha Martian Manhunter Say that 5 times I dare you
*Bruce touches Diana's hand*  Diana :" *I'm sor-* "  Bruce: " 1: *Dating within the team always leads to disaster*  2: *You're a princess from a society immortal warriors and I'm a rich kid with issues... lots of issues* 3: *If my enemies knew I had someone special they wouldn't rest until they gotten to me through her* "  Diana: 😑
Will you be doing a hishe on WandaVision or something?
The bat prophecy is the most BATTEST thing I ever heard
this time HISHE is very early ....
"HOW DOES LEX KMOW MY SECRET IDENTITY" Uhhhhhhh batman maybe don't tell every single pretty girl that comes to the cafe if   they want to know ur secret identity 🙄 smh
Alien 3 Assembley cut anyone?
What a mess DC.. haha
The flash broke the window just by touching it. This is because windows does not support flash anymore
Please do how it should have ended, justice league Snyder cut movie
Next Movie : Martha Rises
The Synder cut actually made me want a Justice League 2
Lex found out who Batman and Superman were in BvS. That was insinuated way before this movie lol.
god i hated that 4:3 format. WHY.......?
BECAUSE I AM BATMAN
Yo congrats on trending you deserve it bro
Jared Leto can’t laugh like the joker at all it’s almost like he is struggling
Bat Prophecy Dreams!😂😂😂😂😂😂
Do you guys animat your vids with moho?
"martha manhunter" Just imagine a being a teenage girl named Martha now
We need a villian reaction to the snyder cut
Brilliant as ever, they explained changes in the 90 seconds, it takes others 30 minutes
Angry voices The heroes we need
I like it when it goes 4:3 and the saturation drops
When Superman was going crazy, Batman should have mentioned Martha
Endgame took a lot of little insignificant details from JL
What!!!! The longest movie is got shortest HISHE😤😤😤
the real question is... Is Leto's new Joker can now be allowed to join the Villain Pub?
HISHE Snyder Cut please 👏👏👏
i really thought he is going to say "they are batdreams"
😂🤣😂
I like the subtle (or not so subtle) troll they did on the ears of The Batman costume.
HISHE IS FINALLY TRENDING!
Loved this! And the Snyder cut! Give us more!!!
Maybe multiverse instead of prophecies lol
All batmans are from the same universe, it really hates rich Bruce's parents. Reboots are for nerds.
is this it for the Snyder Cut?? not even 3 and a half minute of it? dang it you guys!
💖💖💖
1:49 It's Not A Reboot. It's Just His Past Or His Younger Batman's Story.😭 to
Because I’m Batman
Hearing batman swear is strange
What about martha's country accent she didn't have that accent in Man of Steel
My dad acted this way after watching it
Is cyborg getting all of this? He should know asap
But, you're about to be rebooted.....
It was jimmy kimmel bruce., He exposed your identity during the party. REMEMBER
For real though🤣
*Nicey 💥*
“OH F*@$ ITS THE JOKER!” Pretty much describes the ending 😂
Okay, but seriously, WHY did Martian Manhunter decide to visit Lois disguised as Martha? Like, what was the whole point of that?
0:34-0:47 That's one heck of a tongue twister right there
My favourite part of the Snyder Cut is how overpowered everyone is now. It's fun watching all the Marvel fan boys be big mad that the League can now absolutely destroy the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Free Top
Imagine superman says martha as a joke and batman goes crazy and we have batman v superman 2 💀💀
The batman who laughs?
Not gonna lie the Snyder Cut was the stupidest waste of time this year. For all the people who believe the hype, get a life. The original Justice League movie wasn't really good but this isn't any better but just longer.
Never clicked so fast in my life.
''The Dark seeds...''
Why is superman sounds like Deadpool?
😎
*RestoreTheSnyderverse   Bit*hes*
“Allow me to equip my bat-goggles...”
SUPERMAN: S in my chest stands for SYNDER's CUT
Because I am batman
where is "because I am batman", did he say that?
The zack Snider cut is how it should have ended
I am still waiting for Tenet
The BATMAN.
HISHE,Can you do "How WandaVision should have be ended"??????
Dark...seeds
Batman: "Don't you mean Martian Manhunter turn into Martha Manhunter." 😁😂
They are having knightmare because flash time travelled
Bat prophecy dreams
Do How Wandavision should have ended!!
Shouldn’t Wolverine have metal teeth?
Mera had an accent in 2017 JL. The weird part was that it was gone in 2018 Aquaman.
"The 2 or 3 dreams".... oh my yes. Hah! This sums up the 4-cuss-hour long movie. It would have been 3 hours had all the slow motion moments been removed. Great summary of the movie - if you don't have 4 hours to spare, watch this 3:23 minute long video posted on 3/23. :)
Dark "seeds" 😂
He speaks the truth !
Granny Goodness be creepin
"They're more than just dreams, They're prophecy!"   "Bat Dreams!"   This is the best Super Cafe yet!  Snyder ✂️
Excellent, as always. Don`t ever stop making these.
That 4:3 aspect ratio transition was smooth af!
"How many more seeds have you planted" 😫😂😂
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
Excellent
because I'm batman??? lmao he is working his way so people asking why, I love HISHE batman...
When you realize the syder cut is really the hisi cut
Super Cafe Snyder Cut? I'm glad that Snyder finally finish his version of Super Cafe.
Those dreams gave off MEAN Injustice vibes.
Man the movie just came out and you alrdy made a vid. That's so fast.
Holy...I FORGOT YALL EXISTED
This is way too short...
I'm putting on my goggles, Kal!
There arent gonna be anymore sequels! No snyderverse! This is all we get people! WOOOooooo...😐
I cuss now🤣
Knightmare won't ever see a complete sequel cuz WB is paranoid
the cake is a lie
Waiting this for a long time 😅
While all this is going on I am waiting for HWVISHE if you know you know....
“They are not dreams... they are prophecy.”  - Batman, motivational speaker
Joker♠️🙌👌👍💗🔪😗
WandaVision please
😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Dubs videos really creep me out. Refuse to watch them and want the regular old videos back.
This is hilarious   But the Snyder cut was definitely better than whedons version but still it all felt very rushed. I wouldn’t say that it is the best comic book movie but yeah it was enjoyable
😍😍😍😍😍😍
"Mother Martha turned into Martha Manhunter?" Why is this line so genius?
"Destiny arrives the same"  By a Great Philosopher 😂
"Maybe the real martian manhunter were the friends we made along the way"
Lol
Batman's dreams sound huge - maybe his voice sounds like a certain recent president who also speaks in grand terms :)
Make one more on Snyder's CUT
Spoiler Alert!!!
That new joker is no.
BATPROPHECYDREAMS
His not being robot that Batman is different from another universe
I still don’t like Batman shooting people.
Bcoz I'm THE BATMAN
Batman and Ironman having visions of the big bad alien
You know, there is a multiverse so whose to say they only have to have one cinematic universe at a time
Wow I havent seen a hero cafe short scene since 'Martha' Adam attacked the place
Lex knew Batman's identity in BVS. He was sending those articles to Bruce Wayne.
DarkSEED!!!! I have always pronounced it like that and once I finally realized it was Dark(side), I thought that was the dumbest name ever and I still pronounce it Dark(seed) cause it sounds way more awesome.
Love it...lol
To day is my birthday
I want Villian Pub - Snyder Cut
Maybe we won't get HISHE of snyder cut because the movie is perfect.
When he says because i automatically imagine him saying because I'm batman😂
*And I cuss now*
0:34 You have a space between "My".
Superman savagely burning Darkseid, I like that
Supes made Darkseid sound like a wussy incel by his description.
The Mother boxes are the infinity stones, The dark guy is Thanos and the justice league or the avengers. Got it
Batman cusses now!
you should do how the Mandalorian (season 2) ended. You could go so many ways with that
Darkseid did nothing at least steppenwolf tried.
These Bat-dream prophesies cannot be ignored!
This video was created very fast. I wasn't expecting this for awhile.
Martha Manhunter LOL😅😅
WARNING: VIDEO FULL OF SPOILERS!!!!
It’s new
You don't need to make a HISHE, it was made for you
anyone notice how weird Battinson’s ears looked?
Fun fact: loved the movie and I went to watch it again but can't spend 8 hours watching one movie cuz that's just crazy.
no mentions about Iris West & Ryan Choi?
Meanwhile The Batman is basically cancelled thanks to Pattinson.
Snyder cuss
This channel is dying
Didn't they steal the dreams thing from mcu
👍👍👍👍👍 way up for Hishe! About the movie selections I’ve been sending to you, I wanted you to be busy this year, but since you remind us that your animation could take a while, I would like for you to take your time. For now, here are some more tv/ movie titles for the “Hishe” treatment- Mighty Ducks: the animated series, Ready Player One, Spider-Man: Ultimate,Cars 1,2,&3, The Princess and the Frog, Brave, and the animated Batman movies. Thx again, see you soon! Lol🙂😉
I like how the aspect ratio changes halfway through the video like in  wandavision
zack Snyder yyds
So, how long until how the Snyder Cut should have ended?
Can't wait to see the 'Actual' Hishe cartoon. It's gonna be amazing!!!
The way he says "kal" has the exact same energy as cartman saying " kyial"
How the Snyder cut should’ve ended
Uh huh! Wait. That's the detail you're focusing on? 😂😂
When batman puts his goggles and suddenly it all turns to mexico
Remember when they could make a two hour movie that had a compelling storyline, interesting characters, and a solid narrative flow with a good ending?
You guys should do a thing with batman and Tony about dreams
Batman always makes me laugh in these videos 😂
Wandavision HISHE
They have matching outfits now, so cute.
2 to 3 dreams 😂
Please make another... for Darkseid
yessssssssssssssssss finally a video
So looking at Knightmare Squad.  I am hoping Bats uses Joker as a distraction by throwing him and Mera (For Johnny!) at Superman.  Slade, Cyborg, and Bats becomes best friends.
"Who knew adding 2 hours to our history could change so much!?!?!" XD
Is there going to be a director’s cut if this after 3+ years?
Are batman and superman actually martian mahunter and a skrull? So confusing with all of these changes.
To be honest, any movie can be made with great detail being 4 hours long. It would have been more impressive if there was half the amount of slow mo and a least an hour shorter.
Fun Fact: The Theatrical version predicted the Coronavirus. Watch the newspaper headline at the beginning of the film!
WTF 1:51 I did not expect it 🤣🤣🤣
1:50 THAT SUIT IS SCARY
My mother is the Martian man hunter 😂
Thanks, didn’t feel like buying another app service to watch it anyways
Where's the HISHE??
Have you given your life to Christ? If not, why haven’t you been trying to get your life right with him so that you may have eternal life?....
"Mother Martha turned into Martha Manhunter?"
4:3 aspect ratio - LMFAO
i want the 3rd snyder movie
Lex knew Bruce was Batman in BvS
🤣🤣🤣👍
Omg this is great 😂🤣😂  Those 2 to 3 dreams i had Lol
That's some interesting theories about the unknown Dreams 👍
Because, it's the Bat dreams.
Please tell me you guys are working on a How Tenet Should Have Started
"who would said 2 hours would change so many things". This frase is The Snyder Cut and its not a compliment
Christian Bales batman voice will live forever as batmans voice because they always use it, so that means Bale is the best Batman
*"Not these kind of dreams! These are BAT dreams"* 😂😂🤣🤣
Just saying Batman shouldn't swear, like, ever. And especially not like a second rate punk.
I totally agree with him.
The prophecies cannot be ignored..the bell has been rung..justice league 2 will come..it has to...!
Slowly the filter and the screen....🤣🤣🤣🤣 brilliant hishe
im just wait for your video
Lol
They gonna reboot Batman
If children aren’t the “Dark seeds” that Batman is referring to I don’t know what is
These aren't dreams they're prophecies BAT  prophecies LMAO
I missed The Cafe. Mother Martha The Martian Manhunter.  That kind of sounds like Superman's mom is looking to scope out J'onn.  I have to go bleach my brain now.  If Flash can go back in time then I wish he'd go back to some point before Dan Didio and become a decent Barry Allen like in the actual comic books.  Then we might also get a decent rep of caucasian Iris West and her nephew caucasian (and super cool) Wally Rupdolph West.
I'm deeply disappointed that it's not a 4 hours long HISHE
The Snyder Cut would have had to have been 2 movies. No way a 4 hour movie is released to the theaters. Or edit it down by an hour and lose a lot of stuff.
When you having a coffee with a friend after a blunt  and he  gets paranoid 😁
Darkseid's gonna wipe the floor with Thanos when he reaches the Villain Pub
Pleas don’t let Batman cuss again.
0:36 they talking about mother martha was Martian manhunter this whole sounds like a bloggers debate if that is the case and I love it 🤣
I think my favorite episodes of HISHE are when it's just these two hangin out in the cafe talking about the latest flick they saw.
Lex already knew who Batman was back in Batman v supermen
Nice detail, switching to 4/3 framing when it goes into their knightmare take
They're gonna have Battinson come in through the flash movie as a multiverse hop
Pls make a video on how snydercut should have ended pls❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Twilight Batman is a stand alone film like the Joker film. Not set in the Snyderverse.
This > 4 hours of JL ❤️✊🏾
1:28 these are bat dreams
Who's behind the bad dreams? Granny Goodness!
And I cuss now 😂🤬
😂😂😂 good animation lol
Martha Manhunter!
Snyder made me think DC has a chance. Was great, expected to watch an hour and leave but I watch the whole thing in 1 sitting.
Well.. I spoiled myself. I can only blame myself.
What!?...no 2 hours addition!!!
Is nobody gonna talk about the fact that they got a salt pepper on the table even though they're drinking coffee??
I'm looking forward to the next Villain Pub where Steppenwolf and Loki argue over who has the best hat horns.
BvS actually spoils that Lex knows who batman is, and also he tells Batman as a flex  Like one of the last lines of the movie is Lex talking to batman "Oh. Look at us. This is how it all CAVES in. Civilization on the WANE. MANNERS out the window."  Its why Batman almost brands him; but because Batman finds faith in Superman, he doesn't.
MarthamanHunter😂😂
Me: likes video before watching *video ends Also me: laughs and tries to hit the like button again  Oh. Oops *presses it a third time to fix my mistake
The director’s cut finally corrected the “punched face effect” from Henry Cavill’s face.
What are you talkin about, it's a 10/10 movie, obviously... gosh...
Batman: "They're prophecy" Superman: "Why do you think that?" Batman: "Because Cyborg saw the exact same thing!"
And batman is right...because he is batman!
0:20 Lex knew Batman's secret identity since before Batman v Superman, that's why Lex invited Bruce to his party
batman, flash and cyborg saw glimpses of the goggle future. Superman woke up with the memories of it and is secretly waiting for darkseid as he is already turned from the future his memories woke from and I like pancakes
I love you guys and your work!!! 💕
Pretty funny...🤣🤣 "Because I'm the batman"  Greetings from Ireland 🇮🇪
1:51 I love that they still haven't changed the ears lol
Batman : "Because I'm Batman." Joker : "I'm Joker." Batman : "I'm Batman." Joker : "I'm Joker." Batman : "I'm Batman." Joker : "I'm Joker." Batman : "I'm Batman." Joker : "I'm Joker." Batman : "I'm Batman." Joker : "I'm Joker." Batman : "I'm Batman." Joker : "I'm Joker." Batman : "I'm Batman." Joker : I'm Joker." Batman : I'm Batman."
The 4:3 aspect ratio brings nostalgia.
Videos have been so short
This was everything 😭😭❤❤
Taxation is theft, our government lies to us & MSM covers up for them. Thanks for the videos.
How did you make this so quickly?!?
Three minutes of HISHE is so much better than the four hours of Snyder League.
Lex knew Batman's real name in Batman v Superman already.
Cyborg is in Teen Titans, Green Lantern is in Justice League. Where's the cut that fixes that?
did batman have a no swearing rule?
Bro you gotta do raya and the last dragon
Because  I'm  the batman
So Snyder better be getting green lit for everything or I will be pissed!
So was it a hint at the comic storyline where Joker tricks Superman into killing Lois Lane, then it goes into the videogame storyline? Is Snyder going to use up every good DC storyline. Death of Superman, Flaskpoint, Darkknight... Oh!!! If thats the case can Jared Leto's Joker snap his own neck? It'll be the best thing Snyder has ever done besides Watchmen.
DETAILS
Those 2 or 3 Bat dreams are going to DOOM US ALL !!..........(btw....Thanos was better)
Well you missed one thing. Superman seems wrong after his resurrection. Hes not all there.
"I'm talking about the Darkseid seed...  the Darkseeds!"  Dying...
on a side note, the movie was great! thanks to all the fans for making it happen!
Poor Batman. Keeping up with all these reboots and character changes is driving him insane. 😂😂😂
I never watched the original. Can someone fill me in? Did they just give Snyder all the film and let him re-edit and re-release because people hated it?
wow
Damn that fast
Oh no  Its THIS Joker
They're not Bat dreams Batman. They're Knightmares
YES THE CAFE
1:50 damn those ears.............
4jc historic
Cynicism
999
Nice
*Bat Dreams* = *Bat Prophecy Dreams*
lmao this is the same as the ZSJL ratio 😆
They planted the seed. The... Darkseid
Batman to Cal .... Cal .... ummmm ,,, what is a reach around exactly ????
So much potential for the future of DC after watching the Snyder Cut I really want more of this in a Justice League 2 movie
The real villain is *WARNER BROTHERS.*
"flash isnt motor boating wonder women"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This house is safe from society...
The snyder cut was amazing
"Darkseed" 😂
At least I’m not the only one who thought Batman cussing came out of know here.
2:15 The brilliance of the squish to 4:3 ratio and the dark sepia! 😝😄  <3 U HISHE!
It needs to happen
We are the angry voices and we will be heard.
Flash won't be in any of the sequels, Adobe cancelled him.
“The angry voices aren’t going rest.” I thing he’s referring to the fans.
HISHE of Wandavision
The Zack Snyder’s Justice League is literally how the Justice League should have ended.
i havent watch the movie but from wat I have seen from online its this video in a nutshell
Lex knows Bruce maybe since BvS
I clicked like and then I watched the video. At the end of it, I wished I could click like twice 😂
I'm glad someone else noticed Mera's accent.
That "My Mother Martha turned into Martian Manhunter" bit was a some old-school comedy gold. XD
Superman: How do you know these dreams will become a reality?  Batman: BECAUSE I'M BATMAN!!!   ...and I'm the greatest detective.
Missed super cafe.....U ask y is that, Because I'm BATMAN
I compelled to know
SNYDERVERSE! Get it right WB!
It's a shame the actor who played Cyborg, quit, but I understand his reason.
Batman with a gun == The Punisher with gadgets.
I'm concerned about Robert Pattinson's batman 🤔
Missed the opportunity to add someone from the MCU as they're arguing about continuity and have them say "oof glad Im not part of that mess/universe"
I was not expecting this video to come out so fast.
If they bring in the Batman that Laughs, then they will have my attention
I waited way too long for this
Oh, I’ve missed you Super Cafe.
Me: I'm not gonna watch 4 hours of a DC movie.    Also me: binges all marvel movies in 5 days
The Batman is happening but, the prophesies will not rest until Snyder Batman saves the future. The Batman will just be a point in the Flash's Flash point. BatFleck will return
Could you make a Hishe or Dub for the Snyder Cut, Wandavision, and/or Falcon and the Winter Soldier?
and also in the revival of Superman Batman keep calling him "Clark" thus revealing his true identity lol
I need to know, that was Pete Holmes as Batman right?
Warner Bros: There will be no JL2   Fanbase: Ready the hashtags,we will use the old ways
We getting a review or HISHE of ZSJL?
So many people on here loving the Snyder cut.  Makes me question myself for liking this channel.
Batman v Superman.
Super café referência em português
Bat dreams are no laughing matter
It going to be crazy but I think wb is going to go down the path of injustice universe probably
let see how multiverse that wb just want to create
LETS MOVE ON
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO HISHE WANDA VISHION
I just love this👍
Wow that music in the end ...  Nice
I HEARD THERE WAS A SECRET CUT, THAT SNYDER MADE AND IT PLEASED A LOT, BUT WARNER BROS DOESN'T REALLY CARE FOR QUALITY CINEMA, DO THEY?
M A R T H A  M A N H U N T E R
I'm so here for Martha Manhunter
Martha Man hunter     Why did you say that name????
I have to roll with this Joker...     ... and I cuss now 🤪
This was made quickly; considering there needs to be planning, voice recording & animation within 5 days.
Crazy amount of new detail
No one gonna talk about the seed line 🤣
Just realised that Both Tony and Batman are the genius Billionaires that have bad dreams about villains coming
"Lex knows your real name"  Did they not watch BvS?
Everyone has bad dreams But only Bruce has BAT-dreams!
“Martha manhunter” 😂
I know
Batman sounds like Cartman but deeper
Some say darkseid transformed the earth.  To me it look like global warming.   Batman just misunderstood the message.   Superman is mad because of fossil fuels killing lois.
WHY ARE HIS EARS SO BIG 1:51
"what a crazy amount of new details!"
You forgot to add a ton of headroom when you changed the ratio.
Dark seeds lol
Shots fired
didnt lex know who batman was in bvs?
We are entering a new era… One where we just make requests of Hollywood. Like talking to a waiter in a restaurant. Rather than just showing up at the cafeteria or buffet.
Why would batman bother to keep the voice changer operational during the apocalypse? It's obvious they've been on the run through the deserts for a while.
Do The Incredible Hulk (2008)
And I have to cuss now 😅
When the World Needed Them The most they Returned.
Haha ok this was funny
its over 3 hours new Footage
Bat prophecy dreams. Lol
Funny, but a bit short. Can't we get a 4 hour HISHE to go with a 4 hour movie?
Hishe, Do how Zack Snyder Justice League should have ended! please!
How did flash turn back time??? He can travel through different time line but never turns back time???
Quality😆
I missed you guys.
Everyone knows your name Bruce, just forget the secret identity.  People are literally calling you Bruce whenever they talk to you.
Remember when Batman was a ninja detective? Those were the good ol days.
LMAO
Thanks, you saved me four hours!
These would be a lot funnier if Batman didn't go off the rails in every skit...
THE KING RETURNS
Do we have a chance to see these Justice league sequel movies? Huge epic universe of its own
Oh please let there be Darkseid in the Villain Pub
Batman: it's not me it's my seeds
Well...
*Bat Dreams*
Please make a Snyder Cut
and none of it was canon
Your going out of business
I want to watch a HISHE 4 hours long....
My mother, Martha, maybe made machinations of morphing into the Martian Man Hunter; making a mendacious maneuver to mesmerize me to be mercurial. Maybe the Man's meticulous mettle manipulated me into malicious maudlin malfunction
I laughed so hard at MARTHA MANHUNTER 🤣
Marta Man Hunter))))
Batman speaks like Donald Trump like the mannerisms👀 then sounds like cartman towards the end😂
0:59 yeah, I've always thought that Darkseid sounds better pronounced as Darkseed rather than Darkside. I mean come on, naming your villain "Dark Side"? How pedantic can you get? But "Dark Seed" has more undertones to it.
LOL on squeezing it back to 4:3 format
I think jj Abrams just announced Michael b Jordan as the new rebooted superman
It's finally happened. I knew one day it would. Bruce Wayne has truly went batshit nuts. :P
Snyder Cut hishe is near
We need the HISHE cut of how justice league should have ended
Well that saved me 4 hours
I love this batman lol
There's something about Halo...
Ha.  I heard that Snyder Cut wasn't actually Snyder Cut, but most of it was refilmed and simply added (and some parts of the originals were removed) to make a "better" movie.  But I've already given up on DCEU.  And no, I'm not gonna sit around for 4 hours because the first movie didn't make sense.  DCEU had its chance, and it blew it.  Game over.
Underrated but I love that the aspect ratio is also 4:3 lol
Lmfao their more than just dream their prophecies
Sooo does steppenwolf get to be in the villain cafe? In 2 pieces
_”That bald guy creeping through the portal with his Grandma?”_ Most people are upset about how we probably won’t get to see Darkseid in action now. I’m far more upset that Granny Goodness won’t be in action now. That would’ve been a Villain Pub I’d have loved to see.
2:10 Take notes, Anakin. Take notes.
Im happy my uncle has HBO max so I was abel to watch it before I saw the video.
during puberty, Batman had bat dreams instead
0:51 batbaby
This Changes So Much
hi
Finally bat and Kent can talk about himself
You guys are the best!! I love these videos Im always looking forward to them. There hilarious and the best videos on YouTube keep them coming i can't wait to see what's next.
My only word for this is..........heh
That's so funny, please do more episode of this!
"iT iS pRoPhEcY"
Video idea how cobra Kai should have ended
Because I'm "The Batman"
Superman: *doesn't believe Batman* Batman: I'll just make his wife not be able to convert oxygen into carbon dioxide anymore and THEN HE'LL BELIEVE ME WHEN IT HAPPENS
1:19 I was expecting “because I’m Batman”
I didnt know i need conspiracy oracle batman, but now I want an story  arc of this HISHE
Could you guys do How crisis on infinite earths should have ended. I know you guys don't do tv shows, but is it possible you could make it?
We all know now that everything that has 'snyder cut' in its title is a masterpiece.
This is great
It's still the same story with the same flaws and they even added some. Going to need to stop pretending this is the second coming of christ
Lol!!
Yeah because I’m THE Batman, they gonna do that now 🤣🤣🤣
Please do an entire how the Snyder cut should have ended or a parody of the differences of the two
There can be two universe movies of Batman.
I was really really hoping Whatshisfuck's Joker was just a one-off.  Guess not.
It's a bit short. Just add an hour and thus super café will be perfect.
Yeah because I'm THE Batman 1:52
When can hishe going to do a Batman multiverse episode with all the Batmans and jokers?
︎︎︎︎︎︎
Because I am Batman   I like this moment👍
Can you do how crisis on infinite earths should have ended.
Y’all never disappoint!
How’d you upload this quickly?
Subtitles in spanish please 🙏🙏
Batman and Superman chilling out in the coffee shop is a meme that deserves far more credit than it gets.
The aspect ratio changing is genius
Who is ready for “the Matha Manhunter” solo movie??
No one is safe from HISHE
WE ARE GETTING DCEU VERSION OF INJUSTICE?!
I'm not saying I would perform an unoauthorized duplication, but how would one go about that?
I love this, it is almost like a birthday present to me!!! Happy B-day to me
Superman does have a point. It doesn’t matter since he’s gonna be rebooted again 🤣😆
1:30 Superman looked so done.
This. SOOOOO this. lol!
Aspect ratio change plus the color palette change is a nice touch
Batman "Cuss" now, what a crazy amount of new DETAILS!
missed opportunity so say the bell can't be unrung.
What I think we will see in the WandaVision Hishe: -Batman entering the hex because he’s Batman (this is the because I’m batman) -Vision saying „I’m gonna be a father?!?!“ and also Vader appearing -Super café scene? (Batman and Superman in different outfits according to the decade) -Wong -Mirror dimension  -„Yes! Wong.“ -Captain America saying language when the hex border was expanding and pulling Darcy in it -Quicksilver saying „bet you didn’t see that coming“  -the Quicksilver song when he is running
Hishe I want you to know I watched that 4 hour movie just to watch this and understand the jokes
I have no idea they're talking about
I miss the café
Batman should probably sleep some more on them dreams...
Batman is cussing?!, this is Truly the end time's
We knew Lex knew his name in BvS but okay
This was so fun!
My parents ruined me. Thanks to them every time I hear someone say “you’re paranoid” my immediate response is “yep, got two of them!”
LOL i lov it...
Anyone ever notice the misspelling on the final credit card? "No 'Unoauthorized' Duplication Permitted" It just jumped out at me for the first time. Weird!
I has wondering if zack snyder watched this channel and fixed the movie accordingly
Omg yessssss ive been waiting for this now toon samwich
How Raya & the last dragon should have ended!!
Superman: You are so paranoid. You know why? Batman: Because I'm Batman?   XD I don't know why that is so funny to me. I know he says it all the time but I think that's the first time I've heard it phrased like a question.
Is the snyder cut how justice league should have ended?
"Because none of it has mattered until now."   That is both funny, and sad because real life work......
Alright, that aspect ratio change though. 2:17
I recommended watching hishe  than movies u remake, its so dang masterpiece.
Ha, “dark seeds”
How Wandavision should have ended
Love it laughed out loud, can not like these enough
And I cuss now
I like these videos more than justice league movies.
Da Snyder Cut!!!
all reboots only 3 dreams needs drink less coffee get more sleep. maybe friend slice night quill. cyborg make vedio on tv screen looks night mare. wake up look window think world end. then goes out door all green grass nothing bad.
Beat thing ever
Could have called them "Bat Dreams", missed opportunity.
I am so disappointed that Jared Leto did not change his joker laugh
yes I have been waiting for a video
Just proves Bats has asthma everytime he talks.
Surprised I’m here before it hits 1 million views
"And I cuss now" ✌😂
The seeds have been planted The angry voices aren't going to rest The bell has already been rung  *RestoreTheSnyderVerse*
The Angry Voices
Disney:this the way WB:this the way Sydney&Gian:Ok,this the way Disney&WB:Nooooooo everyfan:yeahhhhhh
yall can joke, but you didn't even *mention* Cyborg's arc in the new cut.
“They are not dreams, they are prophecies”                                       -Batman
Darkseid exists outside of the multiverse. So that means that he will still be there even if they reboot. Forever and ever.
love how this video slowly turned into 4:3  well played
Lmao
Martha Man Hunter.. I'm done LMAO XD
One day we're dark and then we're epic, I'm just like WHAT ARE WE DOING?
1:50 - WTF I just seen then again?
I cannot wait for the 4 hr version
Don’t forget about the guns
I just couldn’t stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
oh boy if uncle ben was still alive and found out about his wife being a green alien dude froms space. martian man hunter must have gone thru some weird nights with ben while he was helping to raise clark xD
Funny!
so I don't get it is the Snyder cut good or what
Martian Manhunter masquerading as   mother Martha
1:47 me looks away from the screen 1:51 I look back  Me: 😧
Batman having dreams of a most powerful super villain where have I seen that before oh yeah IRON MAN BEEN HAVING DREAMS OF THANOS SO THEY ARE COPYING THE AVENGERS
They should have made the first movie without superman and then after Darkseid beat the earth heroes. Then flash goes back in time and changed the timeline to bring Superman back in time.
🇹🇷😞
Me, being in the Marvel fandom: Wow, you guys seem to be getting a lot of fun! :D Makes me curious enough to watch these two cuts
0:17 Subtitles for this, please?
Who wouldve known that adding two hours would have changed so much!
What is it with billionaire playboys with superhero alter egos going through traumatic events then having prophetic apocalyptic dreams?
No one is talking about superman new looks?
Now add 5 minutes of slow motion and posing to this video maybe 15 seconds of Cyborg and Flash doing something, and you'll have some idea what the Synder Cut of this video would be like.  And then Synder fans would be all like "It'S sO mUcH bEtTeR"
Their are two kind of dreams: A good dream and a bat dream.
“diana killed a bunch of terrorist”😆
Dude, Batman, the Snyderverse isn't coming back, okay? So just calm down, 'kay?
What a crazy good video. Thanks for sharing it.
Lois is pregnant, it is canonized the moment Bruce congratulated him
I mean c'mon guys, which way would you spell it?
The cafe never dissapoints
The Snyder Cut is the ultimate “How It Should Have Ended.”
0:33 lmao
LETS GOOOOOO
Ready the Armada...we’ll use the old way.
batman is right, he is supposed to say it like darkseed, because he is the batmaaaan
This was the fastest HISHE release after a Movie release
Never thought it comes to a day i hear batman Cuss a word ...  Captain America : “Language batman”
They forgot about Aquaman dying.
I kept waiting for this video
Batman better watch his r rated mouth
Martha Manhunter 😂😂😂😂
WB is done with Snyder movies so it will stay a bad dream
“That bald guy that was creeping on us through the portal with his grandma?” 😂💀
Ithought we were gonna see darkseid
The main problem I have with Snyder's version of the Justice League is that it is far more accepting of killing than the Justice League I grew up with. When heroes killed in the Justice League I knew, it wasn't done as easily nor without a lot of repercussions.
It's all about rebooting this decade.
yeah, because I’m THE Batman
Which joker shows up a the villain bar now?
Was the movie so good that you didn't have to remake anything? If that's the case, then I don't blame you. XD
Batman looks so scary when he sawped to the batman
Wow you made this quick
Clark’s mother Martha was secretly Martian man hunter Mother Martha is secretly Martha man hunter Martian Martha is secretly Martha man hunter Martian man hunter is secretly Martha  Ah my brain is hurting me thanks Martian man hunter and Martha        Wait why wasn’t batman crying when Clark said Martha     Because he’s batman In goggles
I have missed these
1:51 batman looks like he's cosplaying a dark mickey mouse.
Not gonna lie i thought this would be longer lol
Riddle me this why did it take 4 hours for DC to develop characters. WHY SO LONG?
SnyCut Joker needs to break up with SSquad Joker.  Awkward moments at the cafe.
Did Batman just stoled the coffee mug!?? WTF!
Wow
Nice  (;
This was seriously funny. Verily.
My mother martha become the martian manhunther bad prophecy dreams because im batman 🤣🤣🤣
*What is up with nightmares about apocalypses in movie plots?*
Good Morning
Thank you thank you thank you for this!
Can we all cyber bully WB like we did with Sonic the Hedgehog until they give us Justice League 2 by Zack Snyder?
I know, this movie was the holy grail! HISHE, you gotta promise us there will be "How Snyder Cut Should Have Ended", I NEED IT!!
I had a BAT dream, Warner will not continue the snyderverse, and its because i'm THE BATMAN.  Best Supercafe EVER!
Batman: oh I cuss now  Me : yeah n u also kill people wats next a machine gun
OMG...I js loved ths...😂😂😂
Batman Says Lenguaje Cause Snyder Cut Is Rated R
I love that reboot is a verb.
Batman wearing goggles and cursing!  What has this universe come to?  CURSE YOU, ZACK SNYDER!
So much more depth BUT where was Mephisto?
Language!
Martha Manhunter should've made an appearance.
Thank you Kanye, very cool!
I saw this coming
It dragged at the end.
Subanlo en español latino
Now if only DC could roll with the Snyder-verse instead of their dead-in-the-water theatrical version
cant wait for the movie
You absolute legends, thank you for making our lives that bit brighter. Oh, and when Batman said "The Batman"! 😂
I don't know who I agree with more
...and I curse now!
Superman shoul totally not undersestimate a BAT-DREAM!
and batman has no problems with guns it seems
What your problem?
okay I think batman is getting paranoid
They made it pretty clear in BvS that Lex knew who both Superman and Batman were, it's how he was able to manipulate them.....
Fonny
Hey HISHE, u ever heard of undertale? You should make a recap about it.
Bro we want u to do a how it should have ended justice league Zack synda cut
How about Wandavision?
OH F#@% it's the Joker! Lol
Lex learned his name way back in BVS. In the extended cut, he pretty much tells batman "I know you're bruce wayne" (Caves in, Wayne Manor, etc)
meh
Mother Martha turned into Martha Manhunter? 😂😂😂
I like how the aspect ratio changes
You did it already. Or at least a little bit. I really want more.
Polish sublites please
This is cannon
“Why did you said that name? Martian Manhunter?”
I really wanna see live action paradooms
Bruuhhh😂🙅🏾‍♂️😂
Calling it a "cut" is like a butcher giving you a whole cow and calling it a steak.
When Batman said These are serious dreams Kal! Make me think about Batman on some episodes of Justice league animated series 😂
Granny goodness is my favorite dark side general
"And I cuss now!" Joker: LANGUAGE, BATS!  *cackles*
I don't know !!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
The prophecies cannot be ignored
Oh cuss, it’s on. Yellow filters applied! Joker had his laser tattoo removal.
ARE YOU SWEARING IN HERE!? It was Batman mom, not me!
It was revealed Lex new Batman was Bruce Wayne in Batman V Superman when it was revealed he was sending the letters to Bruce Wayne as well as the ultimate edition of the movie where he said "civilization on the Wayne, Manors our the window".
Good one. Truely our fanbase is divided. I soo enjoyed the snyder cut but there are people who will sacrifice DC content over Snyder. That's sad. But WB won't consider moving forward with a project that they clearly have scraped, just cause we got an already complete movie from archives. Better to trend Snyder for DCAU. That's logical. Give snyder a 5 movie animation JLA contract. That has serious potential to win and get nomination from major awards
1234567890-=
how'd you get this out so fast?
2 more hours and boooommm!💥💥💥
Even The Snyder Cut HISHE is Better than Original Justice Leage HISHE :p
This movie was Awesome.🔥👍
*Cuss*
I just want you all to know that I bloody loved the Snyder cut
Can we get a Sam Rami spiderman 4 now?
I am DEFINITELY interested in seeing the Nightmare world sooo bad.
"They will demand more now" looks at the camera.
Hishe with another W? This is nothing new 🥱
The return of the king
That Jimmy Kimmel guy told Lex Luthor Batman's real name. You gotta see the Jimmy Kimmel cut now.
Muito bom esse vídeo 😍🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
HISHE Batman is  the best Batman
Martha Manhunter.
HISHE Cut
0:53 I would hope so. He’s the dad!
awsome
Batman voice 🤣🤣🤣 I'm talking about darkseid scene 🦇... it's like dominïc Purcell voice
@RestoreTheSnyderVerse
Lois is pregnant from Batman
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Batman my main man STOP eating just before you go to bad and the bad dreams will stop wait Batman paranoid Yeah all the time wait did the colour charge? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT THAT JOKER!!!!!!! please bring back Jack Nicholson's Joker(the best) even Cesar Romero's Joker is better I know have Willem Dafoe play the Joker  nice one Batman "I have to roll with this joker" Yeah Superman is just sitting there thinking "here we go"
Please do another villain pub episode
The change to the 4:3 aspect ratio had me rolling
I know !
Aquaman was quite loud with batman's ID in that fishing town.
Huh. Kinda feel like I don't have to watch the Snyder Cut now. Thanks for saving me 4 hours, HISHE!
I legit want to see that movie foretold of in the dreams of the batman
Can you imagine what must be going down at the Villain Pub right now?
Can’t believe Batman got Lois pregnant.
Il was so long that HISHE finally made a reliable video XD So long that I didn’t laugh that much
Superman: "Lois might be pregnant!"  Me: Hold up! >:O
Because im batman?😅🙌
So has superman been giving batman the reach around
Batman's nightmares are just like Iron man's nightmares.
🤣 1:50 The Batman reboot!!!
Does batman pay for the cup when he leaves the cafe?
Alright you guys are back. 😎👍
As someone who hasn't seen it yet, all i can think of is what the actual fk did i just watch
Because IM BATMAN
These are bat dreams...bat prophesy dreams  LMAO
Will there be a "How Zack Snyder's Justice League Should Have Ended?"
the 4:3 format as he puts his goggles on 😭😭💀
want a hise of snydeer cut....
👏
Martha Manhunter
So. Batman is having dreams about a bald guy invading the planet with aliens. Tony Stark: First time?
How did you animate this so fast?
Batman having nightmares of a bald titan alien coming to earth, let's just hope he won't end up going back in time to save his friends and then sacrifice himself in the process.
WE MUST SEE THE SNYDERVERSE
That Super Café is back! It’s been 3000 years!
Snyder Cup ?
It’s Lex and Amanda Waller who know Bruce’s identity in the DCEU, I mean sides from Clark, Diana and the brady bunch.
Well that was fast
It wasn’t that good. The extra hours just made it all more drawn out and slow 🙃
A lot of DC fans: 'It was nowhere near as good as we hoped, but we'll look like idiots if we admit that so... IT WAS A MASTERPIECE!!!' Prove that wrong, it was obviously 10 times better than the original, but that still only makes it good, nothing exceptional. Also its really hard for a film to be bad if its 4 hours long.
"Flash can reverse time an isn't motorboating Wonder Women"
😂 😂 😂 you never fail to amuse us! Almost like all your videos are Snyder cut
RESTORE THE SNYDER VERSE!!!
That The Batman transition was clean
there spoilers?
Wait didn’t It show that Lex knew Bruce was Batman in BvS?
Dude I wanna have that bat-dream
Hey are you going to do how wandaVision  should have ended?
Do the Snyder cut hishe review!
"Because you're about to reboot" 😂😂 I can't...
I'm surprised they aren't bringing up the Superman reboot. Though, I think we all want to avoid that.
Everything was great....then Leto's make up clown showed up🤦‍♂️
Not these dreams... these are *BATdreams*  Bᴀᴛ ᴘʀᴏᴘʜᴇᴄʏ ᴅʀᴇᴀᴍs I can’t 😂😂😂
Can you watch the Snyder cut in UK? Now I wanna see it lol
Darkseed...
Yes, ive been waiting for this 😊😊😊Always been thinking about this
The movie to me was still a waste of time
0:19 He knew in BvS when he said “civilization on the Wayne manners out the window.”
❤️😂 missed these
we need a scene where Bruce and Clark actually eat at a resto lmao
The cafe has finally reopened
You have fake subscribers
BAT Dreams !!!!!? 😂😂😂❤️........Hope the HISHE endings video drops soon ....can't wait !!
😃😃😃😁😁😀😄😅😆
Martha Manhunter
The Snyder Cut is exactly how it should have ended 😎
The batman 2022 cocaín
‘’I know ‘’
1.6k456th
Please tell me their is a how it should have ended for this coming
I love the little touches, specifically the screen changing to "4:3" and Batman calling Superman "Kal" the whole time.
Mysterious dreams that feel so real 😂😂
Y’all are not about to sit here and pretend the Martian man Hunter wasn’t shoehorned into this movie
endlich etwas neues
I absolutely loved all 4 hours of Zack Snyder's Justice League!
So is DCU gunna make Darkseid basically Thanos? (But much more poorly executed.) And will the post-apocalyptic world basically just be Endgame? Wait... time travel to fix it... heroes and enemies working together... DAMMIT DC! DO SOMETHING ORIGINAL!
what is reboot?
Hey how should have ended soon are you guys going to make a how WandaVision should have ended
I really do hope the continue the Knightmare story
I’m putting on my goggles kal 🤣
Love how once they start talking about the Nightmare Sequence, the hue starts to change to the one used in the films
“These are bat dreams, Bat prophecy dreams” bro I’m dead 🤣🤣🤣
So DC's doing a continuous storyarc about bald bad guy's slow but eventual apocalyptic arrival on Earth? Can't imagine where they got that idea from. What do you think, Thanos? "Like me, it was inevitable."
It's the sepia filter for me
Snyder
Batman: I cuss now? Everyone: You cuss now.
Watching snyder’s cut is watching marvel what if.
Much has changed,
I want Hishe about harry potter! every single movies! pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
you should do a x men hishe dubs
The darkseed
I missed this Batman. More of these videos.
I feel like u knew I stayed up late yesterday to watch the movie and posted it right after the credits ended!
I love Batman's voice 😍🤩😂
Well I think he liked the movie
Not just adding 2 hours; taking footage away too.
Ooo "Flash back" flashback. I don't know why I'm focused on that wordplay
LOUIS IS PREGNANT! The end of the movie Bruce tells Clark as they are walking back into the house "Congratulations by the way".  Jesus part 2 would of been Injustice basically lol
We finally have the HISHE CUT
It's meMaa
Because he’s the Batman
"people blew up your statue!". "probably because you threw Zod through that building and killed a bunch of people" "... lets not talk about that"
The strongest super hero ever... MARTHA MANHUNTER
Justice League: "Come outside Darkseid. Aint nobody gonna jump you." Darkseid: 🙄
Restore the Synderverse!
Everyone has to be Deapool these days
I miss this videos please try to support me on my YouTube channel Eddy collins EB on YouTube
Superman:And Lex told Deathstroke your real name bruce😐 Deathstroke can be batman's New best friend
Just like in snyder cut the 4 hours doesnt seem that long... 3 min hishe doesnt seem that long make more snyder cut hishe...
The seed is strong
The prophecies cannot be ignored!
Batman yay
Pretty interesting
You should’ve touched on how the Joker knows Batman’s real name also.
"OH, and I cuss now." (Cusses)
Batman went around telling everyone he was Bruce Wayne in this movie, he shouldn't be surprised Lex knows
I like how the format changed to 2:3 out of nowhere lol
love this channel since childhood
I missed you guys!!!
😁😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The reacharound line finally makes sense now.  Jared Leto Joker knows Batman's secret identity.
Congratulations on 10mil
The real post-credit scene  we have all been waiting for since 2017
Cant wait for the new Villain Pub episode
Loved the movie so much
Why the  mother boxes didnt woke, before kal el arrives to the earth?.. like 100years ago 🤔 Flash is too fast, but didnt see the shoot on him?🤔 If in the resurection day lois weren't near, batman will be fryied🤔
these are BAT dreams!!! sooooo gooooood!!!
Glorious!!
Martha man hunter😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
0:16 Bruh i was not expecting that Not even one minute in and I'm already laughing
Batman was able to say Mother Martha without crying he is getting better ish.
Will there be a HISHE for it?
Changing aspect ratio for more focusing and depth, baby!
Can someone talk to me about what this is and what there talking about
THE ASPECT RATIO SHRINKING
"Martha Manhunter" -- that was actually her nickname in High School.
Marthan Manhunter
Yaaay!!! So happy to see Super Cafe! We missed you!
God I hope they cast him as new batman❤️❤️
You guys really tried so hard to make this funny it came out looking like josstice league 2
Who noticed the ratio of this video 😂
Seriously, what was up with the aspect ratio?  I did not care for that.
Thank you how it should have ended team your videos are the best thank you for all of your time in making these videos.🙂  Zach Snyder director cut was a completely different & better movie. Can you imagine how choked the actors were , ( okay team we are doing hours & hours of filming & that at the time won't be in the movie ) The first release they must of sent the movie to the editor & the editor wanted to get the task done a.s.a.p. The dream scene make sense & the line ( Lois is the key ) actually has meaning because she dyed Superman goes to instant kill mode.
Hishe never disappoints 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I miss the  Cafe thank u for bringing it back
Seriously. Pretty sure Darkseid could have just killed them all with his Omega Beams.
Ironman has ptsd and now batman
Ehhh, this one wasn't one of their best HISHE. 😕
The new Justice League was lit 🔥 🔥 🔥 I enjoyed every second of it
missed hisshe batman/superman cafe conversation so much
"So many seeds to be planted..." LIKE THE Darkseid!
Dark seeds: Fans will demand a movie out of batman's nightmares after seeing clips of it.
Am I the only one who thought they just copyied endgame.
Awesome 😎
😂😂😂😃😂😂😂I love the skits!  This is right on time😂😂😂😂💯❤
Congratulations for 10 M subscribers 🎊🎊🎊🎊🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉
These are BAT dreams! 🦇 🤣
Its kinda obvious that DC is going the injustice route in the next upcoming movie.
cuss...I'M BATMAN
I was convinced at some point Batman would say "Because they're Bat-dreams!"
Mother Martha, Martha Manhunter and Martian Manhunter.. thanks it's made my day 😂
I need Batman to be serious
Even your Snyder cut version was better than your first justice League maybe Snyder cut lives on
Well, wait until Bruce learns what a disappointment his cousin was as Batwoman.
LOL OK THEN
1:51 The big ears are still silly looking lol
WHERES MARTHA
Where is the jokes about "SLOW MO cut"?
He literally REBOOTED.    😃😃😃👍👍👍
restorethesnyderverse mofos
This 3 minutes was better than all of Snyder cut.
So funny. lmfao. I love how Kal is always so relaxed, every time they’re  in the cafe 🥴
So is Darkseid and Steppenwolf gonna visit The Villain pub? And New Jared Joker for an episode?
How does lex know my name? Did you tell him?
I love how this is still the nolan batman🤣
como deberia terminar snider cut y wanda vision
Bat prophecy dreams!! 😂😂😂
😭😭😭😭yes yes yessssssssss finally they are back baby
2:00 - Actually WB and DC are setting up a multiverse, apparently the CW shows, HBO Max shows and movies, and DCEU movies are all in their own separate universe. The Batman and the Joker are also in two separate universes co-existing with the rest of the multiverse.  So, Affleck's Bat can keep going if he wants, Twilight Batman can keep going, Snyder's brain fart can branch out too if they so choose.
Pretty cool and funny
This show was my childhood
Talk About detail... I didn't notice the aspect ratio for this video until someone pointed our in comment.
Did he just say "Martha Manhunter"?
Dubbs i want to see- Godzilla Godzilla king of monsters Kong skull island  Logan Civil war, xd
THIS CHANGE SO MUCH
Oooo I've Missed This
Do us a favor, please never stop making these!
Mother marthavturns into martha manhunter. Just thinking what if The Martha who was killed by superman  was martha manhunter, but not The Martha...
Thanks for the video.
hahahahhahaahahah
I like the Snyder Cut
Its been too long
It makes me so mad that we’ll never see any of this on the big screen bc WB clearly knows nothing when it comes to making smart cash
MARTHAMAN HUNTER
I mean, Lex clearly knew it was Bruce in Batman v Superman...
Messirve
I can’t wait for the Justice League Hishe Cut 2021
The flares lmao
*doesn't have HBO Max* Wut?
Are we going to see Martian Manhunter on more hishe?
They aren't  just dreams superman... Those are BAT PROPHECY DREAMS!!
Restore The Snyderverse
1:50 MINDF*CK Those ears 😂
Dreams? Like the nightmares Tony stark used to have about tanos?
Hii
The transformation into 4:3 😂
That tongue twister.  (chef's kiss)
I was kind of expecting a Scooby-Doo mask with someone revealing themselves to Martian Manhunter. Still good though.
Their reactions to the Snyder cut are exactly how I reacted to the Snyder cut.
Goofy dreams😂
The whole video Batman does not say "because i bat man "
They even but it into 4:3 ratio 🤣😂😅😂😂😅😂😅😅 HISHE Yur amazin
Are you guys doing a wandavision hishe?
I haven't watched the film but I know enough
2-3 dreams
that was it
Here before a million views
Can you make a new seiries called how it sould have began
Wait, so you mean the Martian Manhunter was Masquerading as Mother Martha Making a Mockery of Matriarchal and Maternal Ministration. Misrepresenting himself as Mother Martha to Manufacture Motherly Manifestation, what Motive could Muster such Malfeasance?
This may be the only after the Snyder cut, media we ever get if Warner Brother gets its way
“Yeah because I’m THE Batman”
.
Ohhh I've missed this ...🔥
2:30 literally EVERYBODY during lockdown.
Ysy new video
Are you gonna do one for Wandavison
Sure, he’s being rebooted again, but Ben affleck’s Batman is gonna be in the flash movie, so why not have both Batmans?
I feel like this is the first time I ever saw these characters actually being Superman and Batman. Shouldn't Batman have a diff costume though?
I will not lie, I want to see it. BECAUSE IM BATMAN
Jokers looking hard for a new BFF and Batman isn’t wanting none of it
So basically it should be the way it is with no changes lol
I wanna say that that you should change the suit of Batman like you change the suit of Superman. Batman's suit is so old fashion. Like the symbol. The symbol in ZSJL Batman is dark. So change the whole suit and the symbol.
You guys changed the resolution like in ZSJL... Genius you are
Can open, worms everywhere...
dreams are the brain figuring out reality after all, its just that 99% of peoples' brains usually misunderstand them or brush them off ignorantly before they get hit by a bus its less a prophecy and batman already knowing what's coming because his bat brain has already figured it out he's the best detective for a reason
I’m home
YESSS this gives me life
Wandavision please
Do Rorschach please
Do the punisher please
Batman: I’m having nightmares about a bigger villain that could possibly have faithful consequences on our universe as we know it  Ironman: yeh I know what that’s like here speak with my therapist *hands card*  Batman: isn’t this one of Bruce banners cards?
I understand your Bat dreams ✨ 😴...thanks to the 4 hr Snyder cut.
1:47   here it guys
Why does Batman still have Bales voice?
good to see you guys again
AHHH THANK YOU HISHE!
Possible the best thing to come out of all of this was this video.
DARKSEID WITH HIS GRANDMA 😂😂
This channel should just be called: BEST PARODY CHANNEL YOU CANT BEAT IT
Time=Good Stuff
I wonder if they’ll actually do a Hishe For it
1:53 What’re those ears?! It’s a mix between the 60s and his original debut in the comics😂
Looks like batman had at least one  bad day
2:17 I love how the resolution changes like the actual movie
this makes it all sound like age of ultron
I know!!!!!😄😄😆😆😆😆
Got to give him credit at least hes better than those spoiling attack on titan the fourth season they dont even add a spoiler warning
also cause the dreams have predicted people and things bruce could not possibly have known
Super café! Love it! 😍
Lex knew batmans real name from the bvs
How are these so much funnier than the ones with the human mouths over them?
These are BAT dreams.
Reminds me of batman last knight on earth comic
Nice touch on the aspect ratio!
Lex knew Batman’s name in BvS cause he was sending him those checks
THE SNYDER CUT SUPER CAFE REVIVAL!!
Because i'm the Batman
"dark seeds"
Was waiting for this LOL worth the wait too
He left the cafe with the cup and didnt pay.
I can't wait till the Wandavision one!
HISHE Cuts are always awesome
Where's the villain pub? I want to see darkseid
I look forward to the outcome of the Synder universe. But the animated cinematic DC universe is also pretty good.
I will watch the Snyder Cut so I can understand this video - I'll be back.
Does batman never cuss in the comic?
Does HISHE reply to comments???  😎😎😎
Idk, the snyder cut really didn't need to be 4 hours long.
Yessss!!!!
The best DUO EVER !!
To short.
Is Batman going to build an Ultron because of his bad dreams?
I want a complete HISHE on Zsjl now 😂
Thanos would've jumped in that portal and start smashing people up. Dark shield be like lets take the long way
What was the point of the 4:3 format again?
I wish we can watch it 😭😢🥺😩😫😖😣☹️🙁😕😟😔😞😥😓😰😪
That was more enjoyable than the movie itself.
I was not expecting a Snyder Cut HISHE this soon, though technically this isn't really a HISHE, more like a Super Cafe short. But overall, I love it all the same!
The first Justice league reminded me of Superman V . This  is happening when you  hurry a movie and you cut the budget. I always wonder if someone remade The  quest for peace. :)))
I missed these guys.
About Time!!!!
Nailed it.
That's not fair. We want a long video. We want a part 2. We are waiting.😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
Man... I'm more curious why you didn't have a Wandavision.
Hi
I love HISHE content
Where’s how WandaVision should’ve ended
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
BAT DREAMS
I'm pretty sure The Batman is going to be in a completely different continuity than the DCEU, so the Ben Affleck Batman from these movies is going to be different from that one.
snyder cut is crazy, and it's awesome!!! couldn't wait seeing the hishe of it!!!
Wait, will we get a new Martha who was redesigned and has a different voice?
It would be great but those assholes at Warner brothers said we aren’t getting another Snyder movie 😭
2017 Batman- robin better watch his rated R mouth before he gets a bat punch  2021 Batman dropping f bombs
I don't understand Batman.
what the heck is going on in the dc movie universe?! wait don't answer that I figure it out myself... (4 months later) Ok i'm back and i still have no idea...(lol)
Martha Manhunter  *WHY DID YOU CHANGE INTO A MARTIAN?!*
We need wandavision 🤟🤟🤟🤟🤟
I'm more disturbed by the same cars driving by watching the Sups and Bats in the cafe, especially that grey van.  What's up with those drivers?  They really want attention.  LOL
"BECAUSE I'M BAAAATMAAAN "  ~Batman ( not Bruce Wayne specifically !)
Funny how the Snyder Cut is how it should have ended in the first place
I'm very disappointed that this isn't four hours long
Joker looks weird
There is no possible way I could sit through a 4 hour DC movie, so I'll settle for this.
*Martha Manhunter*  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sounds insane
This made my week
I was waiting for this!
We need darkseid desaad and steppenwolf in villian pub lmao
was here before 200k views
As someone who hasn't seen the snyder cut, I don't understand any part of this video 😂😂
I need to see this
Turkish subtitle please:(
Lex knew Bruce Wayne was Batman all the way back in Batman vs Superman.
99 parademons disliked the video.
Damn, people bring back the Sniderverse
Where is hishe for WANDAVISION
should have been  "mother martha morphed into the martin manhunter"
WHERE IS THE FULL HISHE
On point as usual
Missed an opportunity for Batman to go:  Batman: See!?  The walls are closing in now!  -pillars start sliding in-
I'm sad that this is not four hours long.
How Wandavision should have ended
How The Snyder Cut should have ended
Anyone who still pays attention to comics is basic AF.
Tony Stark had a vision about Thanos coming too, I guess comic book billionaires have esp, or DC be swagger jackin lol
And no green lanterns
"You mean that bald guy who was creeping on us through a portal with his grandma? That guy took off like a woos"   They should totally make him say that to Darkseid in real life 😂😂
i am coming
Should give SPOILER ALERT!!!
Here’s hoping that Emilia Clarke is getting the role of Mera for the future DC stuff.
"Oh and some call me the Martha Manhunter"
What is you favorit movie
Warner Bros insulted us even after seeing the success of the Snyder cut. We will never get what we want. So let’s make sure anything they do makes no money.
Oh how I missed these
..motorboating Wonderwoman. LOL!
Dear HISHE: Please continue the Snyderverse in your animated form so we can see what you think would happen in the Knighthmare future, I don’t care if it’s funny or serious, JUST PLEASE MAKE A PARODY FILM ABOUT THE WOULD HAVE BEEN JL 2 & 3!!!!
Finally a Snyder Cut episode. Hopefully there will be more.
1:49 got me so gooddddd
Batman has prophetic nightmares about a cosmically powerful villain he glimpsed through a portal? Will the sequel be called "JLA - Age of OMAC?"
THANKS----LOL
5 years later who watching in 2026?
The *cuss* goggles. They do *cuss* nothing.
Thank you for not saying how the Snyder Cut should’ve ended...    Because it was Perfect.
With his grandma 😂
Do a hishe on a bunch of cancelled superhero movies: Rami's Spiderman 4, TASM 3 and 4, Batman Beyond movie, Batman unchained/Batman unbound, Superman lives, Green Arrow, James Cameron's Spider-man, ect.
🤣🤣👍🏾❤️
Bat Prophecy Dreams 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“Because your about to reboot” “I’m THE Batman!” ( changes into Robert Pattinson)😆
Oh my goodness, Tony had one of those Bat dream in Age of Ultron!
Do you Harry and the hendersons next
And now : Zack Snyder's HISHE JL
That laugh is perfect
"I'm putting on my goggles, Kal! See? It's destiny!"  Based on Superman's lack of reaction, I'd say it's safe to say the goggles.. zey do nothink.
0:39 superman Batman.. why did you say that name😡😡😡🤬🤬
THE BEST OF BEST
They aren't regular dreams, they're Batdreams....
The Dark Seeds😂
Can you please do how WandaVision should have ended, along with soul
This stuff is so funny, keep doing that
Martha Martian Manhunter cracked me up 😂😂
The aspect ratio and the filter changing was hilarious😂😂
Bat prophecy dreams 😆😆😆
OMG IM EARLY! 8 MINS AGO?
Love you guys hishe
Is it sarcasm? I hope. :D
Didn't this cafe blow up :)
Flash doesn't motorboat WW but is a creep. Have we forgot when he, on purpose, caresses the hair of that african descendat girl at super speed? A girl who he just met. So we haven't earned that much. But rather seen that Barry is a perv.
👍🤡
this film series is still a joke!
Since this year is the 30th anniversary of Deadpool,35th anniversary of Sonic, 35th anniversary of Legend of Zelda and 20th anniversary of Bionicle do a video on them.
Martha Manhunter. Grin.
Are we getting a HISHE for the Snyder Cut though?
Thank you for posting this
Why not How Zack Synder's Justice League Should Have Ended?
It rather funny how Batman becomes slowly crazy the more he thinks about it. Because he's Batman!!!
Lmaoo that was fast😂🔥
Do HISHE Snyder Cut, which is 10+ minutes long. Please🙏
Omg I love these vids it's been so long I have ever watched one of em
This is so good @srajanrawat And he cusses now 🤣🤣
honestly dceu is just a mess. they should just get kevin feige to restart everything😂
Aaaand after the build up in this movie WB decided to kill the Snyderverse. So no more Martian Manhunter and Atom, no more Darkseid, no more Nightmare arc. What a let down. 😑
I would like to see Joker new appearance to the villain pub.
“Who knew adding two hours changed so much!”  Zach Snyder did and it was awesome.
When batman said, “I’m putting on my googles”, I thought they were gonna do a parody using Eminem’s Cleaning out my closet.. 😅
i mean. Snyder cut was nice. not great. bot lets say7,5/10
Because am batman!!
втф what hapend, what I sleep, I may be skipped?
0:59 did you mean hellspores of apokalips?
Perfect
Actually didnt lex luthor know who batman is in ‘batman v superman: dawn of justice’ itself? Not exactly a new info or layer in snyder cut... but therest are accurate...
I wanted that Mother Martha Manhunter bit to go for 10 more minutes lol
I just said "Right" at the same time Batman did💀
I miss this as well.
I haven't watched it yet but if batman is really having dreams about Thanos...I mean dark side the they are take it from Iron man
There part of a multiverse and you act like that doesn't matter
Hey Hishe, Thank you for making new videos and I just want to ask if you can do Wandavision as it is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe storyline and would be a shame to not see a funny video with Batman, Superman and especially Batman asking Wanda if he wants to know her secret identity.
Villain Bar with Darkseid and Thanos debating about who was more menacing!
Finally! I almost thought corona closed this cafe as well
So the Knightmare Future is shown through yellow lighting...  Apokolipse = Mexico
I love how these is  4:3 ratioe too !!
These animations are just genius. So hilarious and talented.  I love these 😂😂😂😂
More of this.
Thanks for the spoilers
Wasn’t it implied that Lex knew *both* of their secret identities in Batman v Superman? The scene where he makes a big deal out of introducing Clark and Bruce to each other would be a bit pointless otherwise.
tHe SnYdEr CuT iS a CoMpLeTlEy DiFfErEnT MoViE
AND I CUSS NOW! WHAT A CRAZY AMOUNT OF NEW DETAIL!
The Lois pregnancy thing could be huge bc it could be foreshadowing Injustice bc Joker kills Lois and their child
1:16 they are Bat-Dreams
Very good to see the super cafe come back
Again Batman had the dream like tony          Why because he batman
00:16 😂🤣😂😩 🚤👸
miss them I did.  so much I am enjoying them.  Sorry, I have that funny feeling that I am Yoda.
So much new details!!!!!
When's the hishe is coming for the Snyder cut I'm waiting
you are so fast
"I cuss now"
I am afraid that Martian man hunter turn to Clark Kent and f*cks Lois lane
Didn’t lex already know Bruce was Batman? Wasn’t he the one who sent those checks back to Bruce and drove him to hate Superman? He knew about Clark
Imagine Lois actually being pregnant... And ending in the Injustice timeline.
When will we get the whole hishe of snyder cut
LMAO
I missed Sups :(
One love
Now I am hoping to see Darkseid, Steppenwolf, Restored Joker, Deathstroke, DeSaad  in the villain pub
Thais is what i needed!!!!!!
The movie was amazing
I totally love this video! I too demand a sequel Batman. Maybe all DC universes can crossover
Took you long enough 😅🤣😂
Yes! Back in the cafe again! 😀☕️
That IMAX ratio and color grading, LOL!
Flash just needs a movie with a Flashpoint type scenario that could reset the timeline and apokolips war gets postponed or superman never died to set off the mother boxes.
HISHE Batman called Superman “Kal” and now I know he’s super serious
I’ve been wanting Suicide squad and Zack Snyder’s  Justice league  joker back on this channel for a long time, great to see him again
The Martha bit was pointless and was only used to introduce a new character, it provided no relevance or addition to the story. It is the only scene id cut. That an the awkward aqua man singing scene
They make s good point, pg-13 should relax some of it's restrictions.  Some amount of gore and profanity should be allowed to be shown, by 13 you're exposed to those things in life anyway.
Perfect
Where is Wandavision HISHE?
The whole dream talk just reminded me of the star war prequels
Mother Martha turned into martian manhunter? Love it
Hey when is HISHE or a HISHE dub of JL Snyder Cut gonna be?
I waited so long, I never watched Justice League because of the SC and now I didnt watch that one either LOL
Wow
Batfleck is not getting recasted he is coming back 😁😁😁😁😁😁
I cuss now ! That’s a detail no one was expected !
I loved the Snyder cut. I have some crazy Disney conspiracy theories but DCs only flaw is their lack of longevity in their arcs which the Snyder cut seemed to resolve. They abandoned him too soon and perhaps Feige sabotaged trying to disnify a very undisney franchise. Give me the blood, the cussing, and the epic clash of Titans. That is this franchises lane!
Ah!! You guys really remember about the super cafe
This was cute but kinda lazy. The SnyderCut deserves its own full blown How it Should Have Ended. I’m not sure if that’s in the works but if it isn’t insert the Hannibal Buress “Wack.” meme
The Bell Has Been Rung!!
Who knew adding 2 more hours to the movie can give so much details ??  Dude that's like the most Accurate thing he has said. Everyone has been hyping it up because of all the new details this cut has given. Well obviously he has added another movie to it so that's given....
WHERE'S VILLAIN PUB
The movie was awesome, and so is this video
Oh this was very much needed I forgot how much I enjoy these
Martha Manhunter ... lol I love it
Te amo Hishe ❤ Me encantó el snyder cut
I cuss now, LOL
I love yu guys
Good thing I watched it already
Anyone want a HISHE Review of Snyder Cut??
I really wish they make a snyders cut sequel about the knightmare future but don't let that stop you from making a hishe knightmare sequel to this snyder cut hishe please
So early
How a bout Wanda Vision episode?
this superman suit looks gooood
I was waiting for this ! Thank you hishe
I hope that they make in the future an official How It Should Have Ended video about this cut of the movie.
You can't make enough of these 😂💪🏼
Bald guy with his Grandma 🤣😂
I was looking forward to this and the Snyder cut lol
If my dreams have even a one percent chance of being real then we have to take them as an absolute certainty.
What's with jokes hair it looks like a mop 😆
YYEEESSS
noice
Bats: "How does Lex know my name?"  Bats when meeting Lex' secretary, probably: "Hey. I'm Batman. Wanna know my secret identity?"
What about time travel consequences
Finalllllyyyyyyy  Wait your alive
Can you make How Godzilla Vs Kong Should Have Ended?
Martha manhunter 😂🔥
Ohhhhh my god
Wow,
That was quick. Excellent work guys
HISHE Cut of the Snyder cut
Where's my "we live in a society" line??
If they do a HISHE for the Snyder Cut, they should have Darksied be like, “what the fudge guys! That planet has already defeated the mother boxes! Twice now! Next person to go to earth that manages to collect all three. Just bring them back so we can take over other planets.
Thanks to all DC fans for made Snyder Cut happen
HISHE Batman is Best Batman
What a crazy amount of new details!!
Hilarious 😂
Epic
Say it with me, 'Martha Manhunter'.
Finally Marthian Manhunter
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS😭😭
mehhhh
Lex knew Batman's name in BvS. He orchestrated entire fight.  Also WW killing terrorist is fine. If Falcon can murder terrorist in opening scene of that show so can warrior princess
Hey like this comment if you want HISHE to make a full on animated movie as a youtube video that includes characters and other things from their most popular videos
HISHE is awesome I missed Superman and Batman just sitting together in a cafe thank you for this :)
Batman is pretty much is right now.
You know when you think about it, isn't the Snyder cut really just a four hour long HISHE in an of itself?
Wait if I watch aleash 5 seconds of the Batman that Laughs in the next Arc DC movies I will be like a little child asking for candy that will be 1 of most Epic things that ever happened in Heroes/Antihero Movies
Hail Snyder
i love you guys so much.
Dark Sneed
Can't wait for the HISHE and Darkseid being in the villain caffe
Bat prophecy dreams. Sounds like a thing.
Batman dream’s are like tony stark dreams
SPOILER WARNING!!!
The ball guy seeing with his grandmother....
I’m one of the angry voices who won’t rest until i see the outcome of this
facinating.
if the Hishe movie doesn't end with Martian ManHunter saying "Then I flew up into the sky, and smiled for the camera!" followed by confused Clark Kent noises.. I don't know what we are doing with our lives.
Did he say bat dreams once or bad dreams x2.
Turning to 4:3 was a good touch
Let's goooooo!!!!!
Here we go with your goofy dreamszz
Congratulations 10M subscribers
Because The Batman was Incepted!
This was good. Anyone else hoping for them to make a full Snyder cut?
These are BAT dreams 😂😂😂
It's just AWESOME 😍😂
Make a directors cut of this vid lol
1:51 THOSE ears again 🤣
Glad to have this back Because I am batman
Ah yes, the old cafe.
Martha Manhunter 😂
Kidding aside, I’m curious.
I love how Batman!s eyebrows are on the outside of his helmet
OMG I love hishe
As much as I love these get togethers at the Superhero cafe, I'm just going to have to finally say it: Batman, you really need to cut back to decafe.  Why? Because you are tripping.
Please leave a review of what you thought of the Snyder Cut
Bat dreams
An idea if you don't finish the Wandavision Hishe When Visión vives his memories to White Vision he gives accidentally the Ultron memories so White Visión eyes turn to red and he says Im Ultron kills Visión and he tell the story in the villain pub
Figh Fight Fight Kiss Kiss
“Lois might be pregnant “                                          - classic superman
Do How WandaVision Should Have Ended and How Godzilla vs. Kong Should Have Ended when it comes out
Peter P and Loki: *watching the snyder cut* Tony: Hey kids watcha watchin? Peter: The snyder cut justice league. Tony: Ur watching a DC movie? Loki:.... Um, yes Tony: TREASON! Peter: but it's really interesti- Tony: BETRAYAL!
The best thing about The Snyder Cut is the Snyder Cut Super Cafe scene.
I love the Snyder cut version its so much better
1:28 "These are the BAT dreams". I'm not getting enough with this🤣🤣🤣.
Here we go again
"The bald guy that was creeping on us through the portal with his grandma." 🤣🤣🤣
THE HISHEVERSE
Who knew adding 2 hours to a story could change so much??
please tell me you guys are still doing an HISHE Zach Snyder's Justice League
Snydercut is so good
Batman and superman finally matching
This Super Cafe should have been 4 minutes longer to make this a Snyder's Cut Cafe ...We demand the Snyder's Cafe
When will we see villian pub?
Everybody knows.....

HISHE LOVES THE SNYDER CUT SO MUCH
"these are BAT dreams"
“You mean that bald guy that was creeping on is through the portal with his grandma? 🤨. That guy took off like a wuss 🤨” 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
I can't wait for the HISHE Dubs
Don't want to be that leech promoting himself in the comments, but need a grade and have an assignment to get a video to 1Ok views by the end of the week. The video is a joke/short about the Snyder Cut (imagery is based around the original Justice League film thought) that I threw together.   Views, likes, and shares are appreciated if you can spare some! Sorry to have ruined your comment experience though, thank you.   The video is the most recent upload on my channel.
Who ever is reading this have a bless day and may God bless u
Because I am be batman 🥺
[insert joker reacharound joke here]
Love this
Поздравляю с 10 мил.
You guys missed a huge opportunity to make fun about Batman screwing with lois... That seed joke was just the golden ticket for that joke.
This is good video. "I am a little curious". Did anyone else feel like Joker was a little annoying in the Knightmare?
Please do a HISHE for Tron Legacy.
(2:51) *"And I cuss now."* 😆😂🤣
Just for the sake of fresh comments
He’s the Batman.... Also can I have a pair of Bat googles?
Because the batman have the bigger ears
I’m Batman and I cuss now
2:23 is this a reference to the movie’s aspect ratio 😂😂 I personally didn’t mind but I know a lot of people questioned it
I WANT THE HISHE OF THE MANDALORIAN SEASON 2, THE INCREDIBLE HULK WITH EDWARD NORTON AND WANDAVISION
Batman knocked up Lous.
Can't wait to see the villain's thought about nightmare Joker.
Nobody cared who I was until I put on the goggles.
The internet's rage against spoilers is inappropriately huge. You can still enjoy a movie or a book even when you know the ending. Only the films which rely on the twist ending so much can be ruined by spoilers like The 6th Sense. But other films ... not much. I don't think I would've hated the Endgame less if I did not know the death of Iron Man.
I did not see JL yet. Still i went ahead and started watching this video. When Superman said about martha became martina hunt. I stopped this video. I dont want Spoilers 😭😭
Mi miss HISHE Reviews
This is so much!!! Omg!!!
Gimme heart RIGHT NOW 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😡😠🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😬🤯😩😳🤪😵😵😵😱😰😧😟😞😟😤😤🤑😓😜😫😛😪😏🤐😥😏☺😍😎😙😎😘😆😅😃😃😲😟😦😡🤒😷🤬😵😡😠😡😡😡😠😠😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😠🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤓🧐🤫🤥😈👿👿👿👿👿👾😹😸😾😾😿🙀😼😼😺😸😹😻😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾😾

Can’t wait for How Zack Snyder’s Justice League Should Have Ended.
YAY! ANOTHER HISHE VIDEO! Congratulations on reaching 10 mil
Everyone: we finally got Snyder cut  ME: I finally got Hishe's Snyder cut
I missed these so much.
*slowly transitions into 4:3
BECAUSE THEY ARE BAT DREAMS.
The Darkseed
So in the dceu batman kills but he hasn't killed the joker for some reason??? Just wanted to rant about that a little.
Theory: I think Flash inadvertently created Flashpoint when he reversed time.
I need 4 hours of this.
I love hishe😂😂
The aspect ratio change with the sepia tone. Perfect.
I wanna see this joker in the villain pub
Snyder Cut: Abimated Colbert: Hold my BEER!
Yes
Holy Shiish
Joker: CUSSES Batmam: Yeah
Anyone who grew up with the dcau would understand why Darksied is a villain who's suppose to be taken seriously (just like Thanos).
Ok! That was Hilarious!🤣
1:19 BECAUSE I'M BATMAAAN!!!
i also have nightmares
LANGUAGE BATMAN!!!
super accurate super CAFE ACURRATE

The return of my favourite mini show series thing
I missed the cafe. And I can't wait for the sequel that's most likely to come.
1:51 Please don't use that Design again. It's really creepy.
26 Minutes
i want Steppenwolf in the villain pub now
Congrats for 10M subs❤️
How did Lex learn Batman's real name?!  It couldn't possibly have been from someone in the village where Aquaman spoke it loudly in front of a gathered crowd.
My mother Martha turned into the Martian Manhunter... Jeez, it’s a letter M invasion!
So happy I these videos are out there
I need an actual hishe for this movie....
I liked the aspect ratio creeping in. Nice touch. 🤣
If I had to roll with the Joker, I'd cuss too.
You should do how the boys should have    ended
You missed a very good joke when Batman suede Captain America  Comes up and says the language
They are back at last
I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who did this in the comments but I'll do it anyway   Captain America: Language!
You guys need a Flash episode! Great stuff.
I have died everyday ...waiting for you🤭🤣
This video was very good, but sorry for Snyder fans, his cut is really bad.
Lmao, nice aspect ratio btw
The protracted Bat Max "Knightmare" is the only thing I disliked of the movie, and it was added in, so, so unnecesary, the Darkseid scene was fine as a hook for future movies if they actually make a sequel.
They are baaaaaaaack
Why didn't Batman have his Snyder cut suit on
Oh man I thought these were gone, pnew!!!  Thanks for this guys!!
Bat man can walk? Who knew.
This movie had so much unecessary stuff in it and WW killing those dudes was just edgy for the sake of being edgy even if it makes no sense.
Because he's going to be the bat man...🤣🤣🤣
Because I’m THE Batman!
no "because im batman" 😶
BIRDS
That was fast
Wowie
Yo u guys going to do a 10 million special 😛
Was this supposed to be...funny? Seems more petty than funny.
Yay
I need this so much
I've been waiting for these for too long
😂😂😂 f**k lol
If anyone sees this,please sub to this guy he is amazing
Yay
Poor Batman! Lol
I loved this movie and i love you guys!
I would watch a 4 hour movie of these two sat chatting in the cafe 😁
I wasn’t expecting this: BUT IM GRATEFUL ANYWAY
Was the aspect ratio change a reference to Wandavision?
Who else watching this video without seeing *Snyder Cut* ?😂
😂🤣😂🤣 yes I love these.
BECAUSE I´M THE BAT MAN
Must have more Snyder cut cafe!🤣🤣🤣
Only Batman got that Knightmare, you know why?
One like One f*ck you Warner Brothers.
So true... xd
love the costume change !
I WAS WAITING FOR THESE SINCE THE SNYDERS JL CAME OUT
👏👏👏👏👏
Oh boy I haven’t clicked on a HISHE vid this fast ever before
This made my day :))
Couldn’t care less about the Snyder Cut, but boy did I miss seeing these two at the cafe.
You forgot to mention batman's new gauntlet
Admit it, we've all waited for Hishe to say something about the Snyder Cut and it finally came.
LOL THE 4.3
Absolutely amazing
I AM BATMA-!
Batman cusses now lol
I missed this... ✨
Are we going to talk about how Ares oneshoted Darkseid?
Who knew two hours could add so many new details?   I dunno. It's so strange that doubling a movie doubles the content, who would have thought.
4:3 was a nice touch
BvS had also a crazy amount of details
Its back!!!!!
Please do hishe on THE BOYS
wating this for a year and though it never came out
Now this is cool
Bruh I really thought the box in front of BatMan’s mouth that said cuss said sus.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"That guy took off like a wuss, why you worry about him?" 😂
I'm with Superman on this one.
Can we hope for a quick review
I used to pronounce Darkseid like "Dark seed" 😂
can you do how snydercut hot is should have ended
The superhero cafe is always a win
Plot twist: Superman is actually Martian Manhunter in disguise
And thats why i LOVE this channel...
We need a Wisecracker and Batboy HISHE
ANOTHER EPIC VIDEO
Isn't there gonna be a Snyder Cut HISHE??
I hate Dc
I want a Thanos and Darkseid faceoff in the villian pub!
These are the best
hmm dreams about an alien invading earth hmm so original  *COUGH Tony Stark COUGH Marvel COUGH*
I was just thinking he should say they're bat dreams lol 😆
Congrats on 10 mil
I miss you guys. Thanks for this
Well Superman is about to be rebooted himself by J.J. Abrams and a anti white rascist with no movie qualifications, and who insulted the first responders to the 9/11 crysis, brave men and women who died to save innocents from a terrorist attack. He said that they weren't human to him. Seriousely, how does such a vile human being get a job directing a movie about an heroic character.
welcome back
Everyone is comparing Whedon's JL to Snyder's JL to see who the better director is. Whedon's JL was still mostly Snyder's work. A real comparison would be, which is better the Snyder cut or Avengers? For me, Avengers all day. Great story, cool villain, funny moments through out, you can watch with your little ones because it isn't just made for adults.
So can we expect how the Snyder cut should have ended?
Come on dude Lex invited fricking Wayne in BVS to meet Clark.
Expected hishe to be 40minutes
IM SO GLAD THESE ARE BACK
Dude, this just needs to be the continuity now, like, fr. Let's just forget the 2017 cut even happened, fr.
675th to comment 👏🏻 Awesome! 🎉❤️
Back in the Cafe once again, just like old times.
I hope then next one is done I. All slloooow moootiooonnnn! With lots of singing Swedish fish and sad song to remind us that Lois is sad (just in case we can figure it out on our own. In the next one The Sitting Thanos, sorry Darkside will kill everyone and in the third one Ryan Choi becomes Ant-man and they use time travel to undo everything. In the end Bruce will travel back and move in with his parents. I can’t wait.
Steppenwolf is the true hero because he choked Amber Heard
10/10
it's been a long time, I miss hangin out at the cafe
Classic!!!
And when the world needed them the most, they came back.
Been waiting for them
Having been waiting for this,
I already love these lol🤣
I need Lex Luthor in villain pub just to I'm craazzy like I'm Batman.
When  is the how the snydercut should have ened comming
HISHE FOR GAME OF THRONES S8 PLEASE. I NEED IT.
Make a wandavision Hishe you guys
Hi
When you'rer so early you're late in the alternate universe Zack Snyder's Justice League was far better than than original my recommendation is to watch it
I LOVE HISHE! KEEP GOING GUYS!
These are BAT dream 🤣🤣🤣 You got me Batman, you got me
Anyone notice the color change
Anybody else notice the aspect ratio?
...damn, that new cut was so hard to watch - "bad writing's endgame" meets "the pinnacle of wasted time".  I've laughed so hard though, so thanks Mr. Snyder. 🙏🤣  PS: This HISHE episode was hilarious - as always.
HISHE IS Back babyyy
Oh I just checked YouTube notifications everyday since Snyder Cut released to see HISHE making a video on it
HISHE for some more Pixar films?
I always wondered what the others were doing when Batman and Joker were talking in the Knightmare. Were they all just watching both of them stare at each other for that long?
I like how Batman just took his coffee mug outside with him 😂
Yay, more café
Aquaman:  "People of Iceland! Do y'all want to know Batman's secret identity?!"
HISHE right on time to bring a bit joy back to my life ♥️
I missed Super Cafe
Last part where They used half screen like in the movie online 😂😂😂
About time we got another one of these.
Snyder hishe dubs
Are you going to do a full hishe of Zack Snyder cut
"The angry voices..."  *looks at camera*  "...aren't going to rest." He knows.
I died at "martha manhunter" hahahha <3
- "Mother Martha tuned into Martha Manhunter?! 🤔" - "MY MOTHER MARTHA turned into Martian Manhunter 🤨"
Don't ignore the Bat Prophecy Dreams!
It’s funny that Batman is cool when he says the F-Word while Robin isn’t
I dont get it
Are you gonna do WandaVision
Haven't seen it yet, just dropping a like! I'll watch it later, I'm positive I'll love it! Lol.
Wow that’s fast
Wait for this only ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😂
Not in 4:3 0/10
hello
Maybe Lex knowing Bruce's real name has something to do with Aquaman saying it out loud in front of several people, who might not all appreciate super power begins ruining the world
Yeeet
Loved that the background changed to the knightmare colour scheme when batman put goggles
I miss these videos :)
Just, where is WandaVision??? I'm waiting for it❤️ Love your channel ❤️❤️❤️
Just a BAT DREAM!!!
"These are Bat-dreams"
Dc fans: Darkseid was a great addition to the synder cut. He was a compelling villain who poses a threat and creates the knightmare earth”  HISHE Superman: you mean the bald guy who was creeping on us through a portal with his grandma? That guy took off like a wuss”  As a more casual follower of dc stuff, that was great.
Very good
CONGRATS ON 10 MIL 🎊👍
Yea boii here early 4 once
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhh
JUSTICE TOOK LONG BUT IT WAS FINALLY SERVED BY SNYDER 💪🔥
That was quick lol
Don’t you want to see what happens with the nightmare future? I mean, not really...
I like how the screen ratio changes lol *SO MANY NEW DETAILS*
Its time for DC vs Marvel because DC will have a good movies like Marvel
Who else has just been patiently waiting for this video? Lol
I was expecting some gore?
Super Cafe at last! I missed this stuff on HISHE!
Still didn't bother watching either version. I need more pictures with Spider-man.
Language!
Cyborg and Batman had a common nightmare
Batman :- Because I Am batman ? Superman :- Because You Are Getting An Reboot! Batman :- because I am the batman!.
Wow this was fast
Well done.
its because i am bat man
Lois might be pregnant!!!! That's what I'm most focussing on to.
Villain pub - Thanos's Supervisor  Starring  Voldemort Joker Zod Palpatine Thanos  special guest   Darkseid
I want to see a how it should have ended of the synder cut one of these days
batman: it's not a dream it's a prophecy!
1:20 because IM BATMAM would have been perfect😂😂
Would you do WandaVision in the next video?
“Ohhh f*ck I cuss now”   Me: First killing people and now this! Deadpool would be so proud
Martian Man hunter is the one giving batman the visions right ? batman can't just see the future
Sup's look in that costume 🌚🌚 coooooollllll...... 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Luthor escaping Arkham in same way joker did like 5 times, guards saying "no joking around". Clearly he's the second joker of snyderverse that forced Sups kill his wife
It wasn't 2 hours!  3 hours were added.  The 2017 version used only 1 hour of ZSJL scenes and added 1 hour of reshoots.
Why isn't the video in a 4:3 ratio?
Where is the WandaVision HISHE..???!!!
Why isn't the video in a 4:3 ratio?
And i was just finished the snyder cut. Man ur on time. I love u
As who's not seeing this movie, I'm confused so much right now and I don't see some spoiler in this video
U guys work fast
That was fast! Thanks guys 💙
Not gonna lie, I'm genuinely surprised how much better the Snyder cut is than Josstice League. Even if it has all the stuff in Snyder movies I don't like. Seriously man, I like slow mo as much as the next guy, but you need to use it SPARINGLY. People rewatch movies all the time, we can appreciate all the details in normal speed.
Cant wait for how snyder cut SHE
I love this channel, everything y'all stand for, channel is so funny😂.
WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY    WHERE 2 HOURS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
Love how the aspect ratio changed
It's about Martha again.
Why did I comment? Because I’m BATMAN!
When will darkseid come to villian pub
Please make HISHE  for Snyder cut
The best
Bro you're awesome. Keep moving forward🤘🏻❤️
so that's kinda cool.  LOVE SUPER CAFE!
And he hits TEN MILLION!!!      [🥳CONGRATS🥳]
I couldnt finish the movie. No wonder all those scenes had been cut.
they should make an anti-heroes bar with deadpool and harley
U just made a 4 hour movie into a 3 min vid... What can i say
You need to give us the reach around joke.
They said the age of Super Cafe would never come again.
F
DC fans please don't watch this It may to harmful to you 🙄
Perfect 2
We need a super cafe movie
I’ll never look at goggles the same way again. They all predict the end times!!
Love super cafe. Please keep them coming.
POV: you're not early you're just at the right time
My God, the level of sarcasm in this is un-freaking-believable. I'm so glad my favourite channels (Pitch Meeting, Cinemasins, HISHE) haven't gone soft on all the Snyder hype
Ironman & Batman both had visions about the planet being destroyed. Coincidences I think not
I wish we could "How Zack Snyder's Justice League should have ended"
DARK SEEDS
1:52 what’s with thiose ears?!
Yeah who knew that making a movie super long would add more detail!?   Well Peter Jackson did, and to follow it up he split into 3 movies!  TWICE!!  Disney did too, and they split their movie up into 2 movies... well ok like 22 movies because they realize trying to cram everything into one movie to try and fix a franchise is a little much...
Release the how it should have ended now!
I actually hope we get a "How Zack Snyder's Justice League Should have Ended" video someday.
Even Batman wants the snyderverse to return
"Did you do it?" "Yes" "What did it cost?" "+2 hours and 50% of aspect ratio"...
Lol funny But can you please do a villain pub soon that’s my fav content on this channel
I like Superman’s cut, g.
I'm so glad that the Snyder's Cut was worth the wait
We live in a society, where honor is a distant memory isn't that right?         batman?
So is this they're HISHE of Zack Snyder's Justice League or are we getting a proper video of HISHE
Ty so much!!!
Need to have a full “How ZSJL Should Have Ended”... Please!!! 😜
This is Canon
Ayy
I've missed Super Café!! ❤️
NOT IMPRESSED (IN REAL I M)
I missed this so much
Lois might be pregnant 🤰😈😈😈
I wish batman should have wore a red and blue bat suit just to spite superman
I whatched the movie and this is so good
so was the movie good?
Perfect
Superman: WOW Batman: YEAH me: I KNOW RIGHT?
those 2 or 3 dreams have finally come true. XD
This HISHE was almost as pointless and boring as the Snyder Cut
FINALLY, THE TRUE *JUSTUS LEAGUE*
do a Snyder Cut with the villain pub with Darkseid's debut
I wanna see joker give Batman the reach around ☹️
Does everything Batman says always have to be bat themed?
Good lord.
Congrats on 10 mil subs
not fisrt
Back in the Cafe once again, but as Batman leaves, Superman sits with Martian Manhunter, in his hero form, discusses his day with Clark, because he's still in Ma Kent mode.
Are you doing how wandavision should have ended?
THE SEEDS HAVE PLANTED!!!
Spongebob has a better laugh than Leto’s Joker lol
I always love super cafe
First
My mother Martha turned into the Martian Manhunter.  Why did you say that name?
“Because I’m THE Batman”  Perfect
Emediantly spoilers no spoiler alert.
I can't wait until the actual Zack Snyder Justice League Hishe
Do a hishe video on the Snyder cut!
Do hishe wandavision
Why No WandaVision. Please say you are still editing it
Because he's Rebootman. F*(%! I mean Batman.
I thought that in snyder cut they gonna defeat the .....that........guy............DARKSEID but total bummer
Man~~~~I kinda Miss Them
This Snyder  cut was so good great movie
Wow..Yeah..Wow..Yeah😂😂😂"This change is so much...I know"🤣🤣Batman  explanations are out of this world😁😁🤣😂😝
No freakin way!
And I cuss now

0:30 I'm happy to hear that someone else noticed the accent because I thought I was going crazy!
We need your full review
14 years... And we are watching them again
Wew so fast!?
Because I'm batman the justice league is fixed
I was waiting :)
I had the same reaction as Batman  Sorry i mean "The Batman"
Is Martha returning in the Snyder cut Hishe?
HHDHDHHD
Na
Every day is great when Hishe uploads
literally missed ' because I am batman '
I haven't seen Zack Snyder's Justice League, ("The Snyder Cut" never existed, the current product needed to be recut/edited and added to with additional footage to be what it is), but how can anyone be surprised that Lex Luthor knows who Batman is, when it's already been established in this universe that Amanda Waller knows who he is? Lex is leagues above Waller in both intelligence and resources, this isn't surprising in the least.
There IS a Multiverse coming, though. Which means more than one Batman. ... "BECAUSE I'M BATMAN!!!" "BECAUSE _I'M_ BATMAN!!!"
2:10 Seriously lets stop hash tagging release the whatever cuts and anything similar to that. Its just really annoying.
I haven’t watched hishe in forever
Please do a HISHE for The Incredible Hulk
B
We missed you
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This video is presented in a 4:3 format to preserve the integrity of HISHE’s creative vision
pls tell me we’re still getting a snyder cut hishe
Is Batman stealing the mug from the cafe?
Can I have more, please, sir?
The video is too short man
Like and comment for the algorithm
Lol lololololol
Snyder cut and HISHE, what a time to be alive
Snyder cut fans 👇
These are BATdreams😂😂
The entire Snyder Cut movie is just How the Justice League Should have Ended.
Op Bolte
BAT Prophecy
Martha Manhunter may be my new favorite superhero name.
Bat Prophecy Dreams™️- Sounds like a  real thing
watched this without knowing anything about the snyder cut dont know what i expected
The most powerful weapon in the universe. The only way to achieve unlimited knowledge. The only way to see what is to come.    **BAT DREAMS**
Normally I’d never advise a mega corporation to follow the money, but I’m positive that there’s money to be made with the Snyder Verse
I was waiting for the video. And i love Batman .......    Do you wanna know why....  😆 Because... Because   BECAUSE IM BATMAN  i mean   BECAUSE IM NIKLAUS😎
Diana knew about ya Wayne.
Waiting for the WandaVision remakes
The Batman
Are we going to see the super cafe vs the villain pub
Batman: the seeds already been planted. Dont you want to know how it ends. Superman: why? Batman: BECAUSE I'M BATMAN!
"What a crazy amount of new details"  Sums it up nicely.
2 months until my birthday
"Mother martha turned into Martha Manhunter?"... I love this Batman
I loved the movie I think it was much better than the original
I was hope hishe will be 4 hours too😋
But we’re still gonna get a hour long How  ZSJL should have ended right?
Ok people here’s the plan. If we (the fans) demand such outcomes from zack Snyder. He will be forced to say yes and continue the Knightmare story arc. Let’s do it
CONGRATS ON 10M
I wish they would release Justice league 2 with the same cast.. Except for amber heard
Where is the Wandavision hishe?🥺
We live in a society... where HISHE is king.
Fans: What do the dreams mean!?!? Reality: They mean the director learned nothing from Sucker Punch
Cmon a full epidode of the snydercut !!! U can finally serve....some justice
The way the scene went to 4:3 and the filter changed😂😂😂😂
"Yeah, because i'm THE Batman."
Lmao 😂😂 knew this was coming
Thor:is this the best you could do? releases Snyder cut CA: you had to ask!
"Mother Martha turned into Martha manhunter?" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Also done in 4:3.
Finally
"Who knew adding 2 hours to a story could change SOOO much?!"
I love how even the format is the same
"Who knew adding 2 hours to a movie would change so much"
Hishe when?
'4 dislikes' darkseid is coming for them
Did no one else know that The Batman isn’t a prequel to Batffleck? It’s gonna be it’s own thing.
The dreams r literally a copy of Tony’s dreams about thanos u just realised 😂
Wait it’s already out and playing?
Probably wouldn’t need two extra hours to setup characters and have them fleshed out if they gave each character a solo film before the team up movie instead of the other way around
The movie isnt better because of snyder Its because he's BATMAN
I’m surprised Deadpool dosent cuss so much like other characters might😂
I love how vague they keep it on whether they liked the movie or not.  Also, wondering how likely it is we'll get a HISHE for Justice League.
My favorite part of the movie was when Batman said the f word and I couldn’t stop excitement laughing and my dad was looking at me all weird. 😂
Why am I smiling?  Because I'm... Er, because of new hishe
Congrats to everyone who is early
Because he's batman, i'm gonna miss this batman he's gonna get a reboot  😂😭
I MISS YOU GUYS! 🤣🤣🤣 WE NEED A FULL LENGTH HOW IT SHOULD HAVE ENDED 😆

We live in a society where 10 million subscribers are waiting for a Snyder cut hishe
I feel like the snyder cut should be a sandwhich at the cafe.
Nice
I'm literally waiting for Snyder cut Hishe
Congrats on 10 mil
1:18 he should say because i'm batman.
It caught me off guard
Damn, y'all don't play around
SPOILER ALERT (kinda)   I am so HAPPY they FIXED flash!
I waited 4 no 5000 year's for this
Big fan. Love from Pakistan.🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰 Can u please do the entire Xmen series.. Xmen, X2, Xmen 3 the last stand. Pleaseee
Batman having existential crisis

Congrats on reaching 10 Mil!!!
hello
And dont forget green larntern jhon stweart
I was kinda expecting a Thor to Cap style part where Batman says “I see you’ve copied my style” or something like that 😂
Llegue temprano 😁😀 esta chido
Not long enough
Who else wants more zack snyder dc film's
Video: 2 Minutes ago and 1.1K views! You gotta be kidding me
Proper HISHE for the Synder Cut please <3
The knightmare sequence at the end is just Ben Affleck's nightmare that he will have to do more of these movies.
when there's 117 views but 326 likes and that one guy that always dislikes
The other day I realized you guys missed a golden opportunity:  “Alright we got the title for the next spider man film, let’s just tell it to Tom and hopefully he won’t spoil it” “Here’s a bright idea: how about you don’t tell Tom so he won’t spoil all of our hard work just because you were too lazy to know he can’t be trusted with spoilers?” “Ugh, fine I guess we won’t tell Tom”  How the Spider Man: No Way Home reveal should have ended
I like how they talk like they lived the movie out
BRO LETS GOOO HISHE FOR LIFE
The movie was fantastic, far better than the "original" and more than worth the runtime! LOVED IT
made me smile on a rough day, thanks hishe!
Are you going to do a Hishe review?! Do it!
10 million subs
Love from India
I was so waiting for this. HISHE Darkseid the new member of Villain Pub
I’m gonna cry, I’ve missed them so much
I like the aspect ratio detail
Big up the 10 mil
*They came back!*
Because your about to reboot  💀
You should make a video on wandavision
When you're so early, You can't think of a joke for the comment section.
Me: Sees this a bit and realises that there are spoilers. Also me: I'll be bacc! I missed you Team Hishe ❤️🙂
Justice takes time, and 4 years later, it finally got served.
So Martian Manhunter was the General from MOS, why tf didnt he helped Superman when earth was being terraformed?
This spoof video is way way Better than josstice league(2017).
Okay, the Snyder Cut wasn't just a 2 hours extension it was the vision of the first director. Justice League 2017 was Jos Whedon cut of the movie with some aid from what Zach had done before he had to leave the project.
Release the Ayer cut cafe
Happy 10 mil
Love from India 🇮🇳
I’m not trying to hate or anything, but you guys should do a lot more How It Should Of Ended that are not superhero movies. I feel like that’s all you post now
0:35 "Mother Martha turned into Martha Manhunter?"
Ah yes, the brown filters.
They r dark knightmares indeed batman
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.
Dope as always 😆🙏
It's been so long since I last saw a HISHE, we miss you guys...
Oh, how I've missed Super Cafè.
Imagine if this video  was 4 hours
Wait you saw my tweet?...Thanks!!😂
First!
Bruce pulling a Tony

I  love how we are so desperate for new content that we watch a 4 hour movie         I still watched it though
