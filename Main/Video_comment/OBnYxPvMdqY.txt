Julian Alvarez is picking up a lot from Messi. His ability to start a play and then sneak back into to finish is amazing. Not as agile as Messi was in his youth but his speed and just how works hard is amazing.
Alvarez run on first goal was great (CZ defenders being too relaxed helped) and Haaland pass was perfect but still. Alvarez foot work to get around keeper and score might be the best one I have ever seen.

Man City against RM: Stronk  Man City Against RedStar Belgrade: Weak
the zve keeper is 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Wait...so Crvena zvezda is the storied Red Star Belgrade!! Took me awhile to figure that out. They won the European Cup long before Manchester City were an item.
the zvezda keeper saved his team from 7 goal defeat.
Ain’t no way Haaland is winning the ballon do’r next month
Rather annoying announcer in the employ of MC. No attempt at neutral ground. Just because they failed to net a goal in the first half, they "deserved" squat thanks to the opposing goalie. So PO squid.
Feel bad for Zvezdas Keeper he is way to good for that team dude had 13 saves and half of those were top top class😢
This Rodri is such a complete player.  A defender with his eyes constantly on goal because he knows what he can do from a distance.
Remember that this is a serbian team, no glazing allowed
I love the guy from 5 live radio, if you remember him from the 90s, the voice is so distinctive
That goalkeeper kept the score decent.
Who?
Great show by Alvarez but can we appreciate how class Doku has been for Man City? A very, very promising talent who just seems to dazzle defenders every time.
One big mistake but the Belgrade keeper played fantastic as a whole. Idk how they gave alvarez that goal though
Haland is overrated asf😂
What a dead crowd. man more enthusiasm is needed jeez
Commentator so bored when Crvena scored but freaked out when City scored
Alvarez is younger than haland and won everything
Alvarez is a better finisher in my opinion than halland. They work together very well
Question: Can City still be brilliant after losing the outstanding players DeBruyne, Mahrez and Gundogan? Will they be able to beat Liverpool with a good team largely intact? The answer is coming slowly as yes, and Doku is part of that answer.
Álvarez is low-key becoming new Agüero day by day 😊
Amazing and Spectular performance from Man City!!!👍
8:27 Glazers trying to save Manchester United:
Rodris game is beautiful and so relax too
wheres kdb?
When they don't show you the reply of the first goal.....if was off side or not....
Prejaki za zvezdu
How one man city jerseys don’t have the gold badge? From being champions
The score had to be higher for MC, playing with kids.
Foden’s 1 touch passing is a beautiful thing to watch.
Good game but that goalkeeper was the star for his team
FK CRVENA ZVEZDA did a pretty good job at keeping City from scoring 10 goals. As well also Haaland too. 👏👏👏
Whaaaaaatt!!! Early Haaland didn't score today!! It seems like this dude scores goals in his sleep. 😅😂
Man City has world class players that know how to play as a TEAM and for the TEAM. That is why they won the Champions and most likely to repeat if they stay healthy.
whose this 11 ??
I hate city with a fire in my belly but god damn rodri is a baller
Man $hitty didnt deserve a single goal
Man i feel bad for the goalie.. he has no defence whatsoever.
Rodri. There. I am talking about him. So good. So class. Always reliable. But that keeper for the reds.. Dang so good. Had a helluva workout lol
Real madrid or Barcelona should sign Alvarez, he deserves to be the main man..!
Rodri is the best midfielder in the world atm
Julian Alvarez needs to wear new jersey next season. Not 19, but 10
Wow Rodri is too good 😅
Well done, City !  Thanks CBS !!  COYG beat PSV !!!
His defenders were just clueless 😢
Kudos to Bukari. That was a chance well taken. ❤
I was stunned to see that Haaland missed so many opportunities
I mean his name IS glazer
That goal keeper is good big clubs take notice
Alvarez, Doku, Rodri…
That second goal for city what a goalazo!!
It is not a Manchester City, t is International City. Buy foreign players and claim you are domestic club. What a joke
I love man city the gipsys loose again  Go man city and Partizan 🔥💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
And they are saying that Haaland is the best of this team, just because he is the main scorer. They are killing the football...
Rodri is so far  the best of City
I got a feeling pep wants that goalie for city
That turn from rodri at 11:12 is so underrated. No fancy step overs or anything like that just shifting his body weight to get in the right spots. World class
I love Mancity!!
Rodri is class 👌
Spiderman saving the city again!
Great performance for the goalkeeper too bad for the mistake. Every player makes mistakes.
How wasnt that first goal offsides? I don't get this sport
the partnership between Foden, Haaland and Alvarez is so dangerous in attack. The craziest part is that they are all only 23 years old! a lot of class, skill and confidence at such a young age and they are all key players in the best team in Europe for the moment
why is there a VAR check every time someone scores on City 🤣
Bruh did someone pay pogba voodoo doctor to jinx Haaland cause no way mah Boi miss over 6 chances to score lol
Esa combinación entre Haland Y Julián puede ser la más goleadora de la champions 👏🏽👏🏽
Rodri is a stud.  A man amongst boys.  All business-like with the shirt tucked in looking like a doctor doing rounds with his patients.  He needs a coat and tie out there.
Despite the scoreline Zvezda played a good game they really fought, Glazer too despite the blunder on the 2nd goal. If Zvezda fight like this in the 2nd match in Serbia that's gonna be one hell of a game
720p is crazy, step ur quality game up
That Alvarez finish was outrageous 😅
phenomenal game from glazer, unfortunate deflection
Walker got his goal stolen lol he was onside
This commentator is brilliant 👏
Halaand disappearing on the goal sheet again in a big comp? Not surprising.
Again its was just a matter of time for Alvarez to shine guys relax and haland maybe its not scoring but defenders are keep busy cause of him and also assist is important
Doku appreciation comment
Haaland the tree trunk does it again, goes missing when mostly needed and is carried through uncomfortable games.
Haaland is missing  Grealish and Kdb big time 👀 Doku and Alvarez are helping with the goals but are taking some of the positions  that haaland likes to roam.
Rodrigo is world class
Lest talk about rodri
Wow what a player Rodri is truly class! 🙌🏽
The real question is: how much money is Chelsea going to spend on that goalkeeper for Red Star? With the exception of the one punch he missed, he looked phenomenal.
Haaland not scoring vs Red Star is hilarious 😂
Rodri and Alvarez played a great game!
Rodri is world class. Pure class.
Rodri is a beast
720p?
Count Doku taking souls
No first half goals is becoming a problem for Manchester City. Lack luster starts will kill the team. Come on lads
Lo que juega Rodri madre mia
First goal is offsides 😂
😂 that free kick tho
Alvarez please come to Barca 💙❤️
Let me save you time from watching this easy win that man city got. Bcz they HAVE SUCH A HARD GROUP to beat.   They won 😂
Don’t get on Haaland and his not finishing lately, the guy is showing that he’s actually human 😂 he’ll get back to 2 to 3 goals a game very soon! Doku’s speed snd creativity and Nunez’s patience and brilliance is making us look more dominant then we did without them early in the season and when Stones and KDB return this team will be unbeatable times 2 smh Blues baby 💪🏽
Y la gente se pregunta por que Álvarez está en la lista de Ballon D oro
I thought a lot of our Blue faithful were losing their minds a couple weeks ago when they were saying that Rodri is the best Midfielder in the world 🌎 but now i think I’m losing my mind 😂 the guy has elevated his offensive game ten fold since Gundogan and Mahrez left and it’s paying dividends for us!
I think the second goal was also the wind that helped man city.
Damn shame about that 2nd Man City goal
Wow, Alvarez's first goal was magic. Just incredible.
Rodri is still improving somehow
1:36 Just a different level.
Alvarez had kdb vibes all over that match
Rodri comes up big in needed moments.  Doku made that 1st goal keeping possession
where is Grealish
Walker wasn’t offside that was a goal mate
Slow day in the office for Haaland
Alvarez cutting outside and ball roll to score in half a second tf😂
Julian Alvarez  at the 10 is the beat decision Pep has made
Watch out for de Ghanaian star Bukuri in the ucl the future star no is talking about wooow what a. Performance $$$$
Walkers goal was legit!
Goal keeper had a MLS moment 😂
Keeper didn't do a double fist punch there wtf ? 8:40
8:02 this is what you could be looking for
Rodri dictates the tempo of the entire match. Always in the perfect position making the perfect passes to progress play.  It’s beautiful to watch
Rodri is a beast....
Haaland missed so many chances, not his day
goal keeping masterclass
The goal keeper was great
It's almost 2024 CBS...You guys still can't even do 1080p!? WTF is wrong with you guys?
What a goalie
Alvarez did amazing today!
Rodri honestly needs to be in talks for Balon d’or. I wouldn’t hesitate to say he’s the best midfielder in world football right now. De Bruyne is who he is, however City really do not have anyone who can do a job like Rodri does
At this point I think Rodri should be given the Ballon d or. He has earned it.
this guy haland is over rated just like gavi 😂
Julian Alvarez Is Very Special
My respects to the keeper he saved very crucial ones but messed up in a ball he coul have catched
Haaland had his chances. But Julian just took them better idk what to tell you. If he keeps starting we will see a very close competition between them.
The Alvarez finish is insane
I don't know about this game, but I see a decline in in Man city performance, yea, yea Alvarez, and Rodri were terrific but where was everyone else?
Nah bro since signing with Prime Halland down hill this can’t be bro
That fkn Alvarez goal is going to be grossly underrated.. did you see the finesse over the ball he put to just put enough spin and speed on it.. 🔥🔥👏🏻👏🏻👊💯
Doku under Pep guidance is scary scary
Julian Alvarez 😍
Inter Miami probably can beat this Zvera team.
No one is talking about foden he is no kdb but sheesh this guy is a absolute baller
Dunno if Rodri or Henry on that finish geeeeze levels
Rodri is such a bucket
Goalkeeper performance was just insane , he make a mistake but he was class today
RIVER PLATE's Alvarez is giving Manchester just a taste of what he can do. Sos un capo maestro de la 9. I hope that Pep will give Julian the royal treatment that he deserves.
Doku is good
Bro Alvarez is one of my favorite players and seeing him play like that makes me very happy, he deserves more game time and maybe the number 10 jersey
damn I could of been there fr
Rodri has so much composure
Rodri took a stroll on that last goal and still scored. 😅
Really? We have to draw the offside line ourselves at 4:17
Love how much Rodri has improved. I remember I used to think that he was only decent. Man makes it look too easy at times 🔥
Red Star be proud of your performance.
Rodri is a beast bro
Rodri makes things look so easy.
Doku is 🔥
I say this every week, Julian Alvarez is the most consistent, beautiful and skilled number 10 City could ever have after KDB. RODRI is the engine of City. Great Team
we need the super league... 22 shots to 1.. smh
황! 뭐하니!!!! 슛을 어케 그렇게 때리냐... OMG
How can haland win ballon dor😅
Man that goalkeeper is an example of every single keeper in FIFA🤣
Rodri is so good!
Rodri is just too good omg. Best CDM in the world rn and it's not even close.
Foden x Alvarez link up goes crazyyy 🥶 Rodri is a undoubtedly the best cdm in the world 👑
We’ll see you on Marakana stadium, there anything is possible 👍💪
Haaland is missing Bruyne this season for sure
Rodri just like Busquets the most underrated players of their time.
glazers still finding a way to ruin my day
Foden is him
Alavarez is a bonafide STAR. He has turned from a pure number 9 into a great false 9/ number 10. he creates so many chances and is deadly accurate on crosses and long shot. He is filling KDBs roll perfectly and him and Erling are creating quite the 1 2 punch
Djiga will go for big money
Chelsea is on the way to buy Glazer 😂
As a United fan, Rodri is honestly the best defensive midfielder I can think of
Am I the only one who isn’t so convinced about man city? I know they won but they can’t be losing to a team I can’t even pronounce the name of at half-time. They also had 37 shots and only scored 3 of them. Same as the west ham game. They also almost drew with Sheffield United. Some day in one of these games they are gonna embarrassingly lose to one of these types of teams
That first goal 👌 nice finish 👏
Rodri is the best defensive midfielder on earth, nobody else comes close.
Put some respect on my boy Haaland’s name. He gave a beautiful assist to Alvarez after haters talk and say he’s not playmaker or can’t link up play. Great run by Alvarez too. Doesn’t matter who scores the point of the game is to win LETS GO CITEH!!!! 🤍💙
70 mil compare with 1.2 billion  and still did a good job , representing our country in a good way against the best team in the world ! 👏
What is wrong with the Paramount+ broadcast clarity?  It is truly unwatchable.  And it is on all of their offerings from studio to live games.  I hope it is fixed soon.
vamos mc
vamos
Incredible performance by Rodrigo and Alvarez.
720p highlghts in 2023 lol
And I’m supposed to believe Julian and Haaland can’t play together??
Really impressed by how Alvarez sorted out his feet on that first goal, some athleticism Haaland may not score every game but hes clearly learning how to attract defenders and open up space for other midfielders. This city team is scary!
I used to think that fifa made their computer difficulties unrealistic, but they really based their hardest settings on Man City style of play.
Glazer, catch the gd ball!
haaland needs a break, he’s probably mentally exhausted.
Glazer stop every haaland shot
That was really good game. I was going for Crvena Zvezda.
Ridiculous skill from Alvarez. What a find. What a bargain.
Real Madrid pls fichalo antes de que se haga estrella y sea muy caro
Alvarez deserves to be in ballon d'or chat than halland
K. Debruyne injury is raise of Alverez
Where is Kevin De Bruyne?
haaland performance a joke...alvarez is 10 times better.
Erling Haaland needs to finish his chances
This man city left back popped up out of nowhere and is killing it
Covenant zvezda goalkeeper is so good. He saves a lot of balls. The score should have been 8-0
Julian > Halaand
That pass from Halaand was something he didnt have in his locker last season. He is getting better for sure. Just in a finishing slump
Julian Alvarez > Haaland
This is madness bro city would be the first club in the world to score more than 10 but yet end up scoring 3 but wow win is a win 😅😂
Didn’t Man City win against inter Milan
Alvarez is stepping up to be a big player for City.
This was basically Man City vs West Ham
Nah, though I feel bad for Red Star’s keeper, Alvarez is becoming key to that City team in his own way.
I've been SAYING Julian Alvarez should be Man City's best player!!  He HAS a world cup!!  Therefore, he HAS to be the BEST!!  And YES!!  HE should win the Ballon D'Or!!!  He won ALL the big trophies in a single season!!  Otherwise, world cup CANNOT be the best tournament in the game!!!
Say what you want but... Alvarez > Haaland
No matter how many saves they make commentators always talk bad about the GK. Anyone else notice this? It ain’t easy saving shots
Bigger teams better be looking at the goalie
Finally a Glazer does something positive in Manchester....
what a goalkeeper..👏👏👏
People underestimate haaland’s vision and playmaking. He most definitely is capable, that’s just clearly not his job in pep’s system
10:20 That's why Pep would not give Foden a regular spot at CAM. Dude just gave up half way like it's none of his biz
give my tidol terling taaland tap in or he retires👻👻👻
Pep giving Alvarez all the freedom he wants from the midfield he links up way too well with Haaland, Pep really is too good by keeping Foden and Silva on the wings instead of giving them the freedom they normally had because then they'd clash with Alvarez
Lets appreciate Crvena zvezda. They played amazing. GK was great
11:12 one of Rodri’s softest goals ever 😂
Glazer has a terrific game except for the second goal.
A New football star on the rise>>>Alvarez
As a City fan I almost feel bad for that goalkeeper.
Haaland is a beast, Alvarez is becoming a monster. The team are playing like wolfes pack hunting. Great teamwork!
Now I see why Real Madrid are interested in Julian Alvarez if the deal with mbappe doesn’t follow through.
What a finish by alvarez
Halaand connection with Alvarez is very underrated
Alvarez as 2nd striker behind Haaland is percent, Foden can play at the right and when Grealish back he definitely start at left side, City can play rodri as CM along with KDB when he backs.
Alvarez and Haaland are best playing together! What a play!!
As a Chelsea fan. I so wish we had julian Alvarez in my team. He is by far the most underrated player in the world in my opinion. I
Billion $ team vs 30 million $ team. No shame in loss. Go Red Star!!!!
I hope people agree with me that Julian Alvarez is the most underrated player
Alvarez is that guy, he’s different, what a player and from Argentina 💥💥💙💙
Why Man City dind't have the champions league winner emblem in the middle of their jersey?
Not thrilled that Haaland couldn’t make any of his chances count BUT I am very glad he is NOT a selfish striker looking at the pass he made to Alvarez. Great team play
That goal keeper saved a lot of good shots for his team, props to him 💯
good job bukari you scored
Omri Glazer should get man of the match for keeping Crvena zvezda in the game like that, he was the defense
are we not gonna talk abt the goalkeeper man was insane he did good expect the free kick where he made a mistake but still he was class
Just brilliant football from City. All you can do is tip your cap to them
Manchester City is probably gonna win the Champions League again
Is it just me or have Rodri, Alvarez, and walker leveled up a lot? Wow very scary site!
Good god Rodri goal was sweet
Alvarez is saving City in almost every game this season. Best city player so far this season ❤❤
City are winning a second UCL title in a row, Mark my words
Props to Crvena Zvezdas keeper even though he had a crucial goal scoring mistake he still saved 13 shots on goal and made crucial saves
Haaland isn’t a big game player 🤕
Shame about the second goal, glazer played an insane game
Foden with a clear header, and heads it straight to the keeper. When is Debruyna coming back. Foden is too inconsistent.
Alvarez the spider man 🕷
Rule number one never score first against man city💀
So once City get rid of Alvarez, who  will replace him?
Did haaland ghost
Damn that 2nd goal from Julián Álvarez. It was this close to enter The Haaland Hattrick club. But he will one day.
Haaland keeps getting unlucky on those aerial volleys. He goes for wild shots above the defense and then just barely misses or has the keeper graze the ball out of the way.
Julian Alvarez is better then halland alot of the times change my mind
Alvarez obviously clears haaland, he's pretty useless when bruyne isn't playing for his tap in goals. Alvarez is much a better player and all around. It's amazing how all the Argentines making free kicks, Di Maria few a week ago and now alvarez.
J Álvarez is a good deal for Man City
Alvarez should be Argentina's next super star after Messi
Julián Álvarez is him.
Damn Rodrigo is such a damn good player
ALVAREZ is such a clinical and intelligent finisher
Julian Alvarez would start as a number 9 at any team if he wasn’t at City period! He is an incredible player!
the goalkeeper was on fire. despite the 2nd goal it was probably his shoulder still hurting.
i miss mahrez
Rodrigo must be worth like 150 mil right now
Rodri was playing so good, he was probably like Kevin De Bruyne who??
By saying "Haaland can't find the net" minimizes the goalkeeper stopping him from scoring.
Julian and doku better than foden and grealish
Haaland has been so unlucky this season 😂 hopefully he can start finishing like last season
It baffles me that no one is talking about Rodri. That man really showed his class and composure today.
City barely tried and could have scored 10 goals, they tried 10% in the second half to be clinical and they scored 3
And that is why football is wonderful, Red star crossed the half one time alone in the first half and scored after City missing 10 chances! But lets go back to my boy Julian, what a clinical player, speed, passing, shots, the whole package, truly brilliant. Rodri is the pillar of the team, absolutely exceptional. And Doku fits like a glove on the left side, great signing. Lets do it again boys! Hit them Pep!
👻 Haaland 👻🥱
What a goalkeeper 👏 , too bad for that one mistake but overall great moment for him. Nije loše cigani
Rodri Ballon d'or
City better increase Alvarez’ salary lol
Rodri is something else boys...
foden could’ve had so many assists tonight lol
Ngl, im shocked that man city didn't win 6-0.
Wish man united Glazer cared to stop city as much as this 1 was smh😢
im not saying alveraz is better than de bryune, but the alveraz-haaland duo is on par with de bruyne-haaland duo imo
How in the world is Gazprom able to sponsor a team?
Sergio Gomez's left foot is special 🎉
Such a good game
Since when Rodri became forward? He had like 10 shots 😅
Timing the rotation of grealish and doku will be key
is it too soon to put Julian Alvarez aside of Haaland and Mbappé? Btw, this Glazer is sooo excellent today compared to another Glazer in Man United 💀
Doku breaking ankles is one of my new favorite things to watch
$SEEL
*Props to Crvena zvezda they were quite solid defensively and even got a goal in. Tbh i expected man city to win 5-0*
Julian Alvarez this season needs to be talked about more. He's been City's best player
Glazer was immense. True he messed up on the second goal, but still a splendid performance! Could’ve been 6-7 without him!
*Man City are blessed to have Alavarez. Dudes on* 🔥🔥🇦🇷
Easy win for city they equalized in no time and win how they always do 💯🔥
Julian Alvarez is that guy. He is easily the starting 9 on any other team not named City or Bayern. And he has already scored a free kick before Haaland and Mbappe (it's banter don't get offended)
Another game where City leave at least 3 goals on the pitch.
Alvarez is absolutely insane
gg
Messi wining the ballo ndo
Omri Glazer was so good, he made 13 saves against this crazy city side. If it weren’t for him man city would’ve scored 10!
